[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_04]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:03.640] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm Crystal.
[00:00:04.560] [SPEAKER_03]: And I'm Anne.
[00:00:16.660] [SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Anne. The last episode she was on was Girl Talk, Episode 131, Platonic
[00:00:23.480] [SPEAKER_02]: BFFs. And this week we have Anne on to talk about something that's been occupying our
[00:00:30.740] [SPEAKER_02]: minds a lot lately and really providing great entertainment value, I would say. So we wanted
[00:00:37.680] [SPEAKER_02]: to talk about the boom in Korean reality TV. And I would say this is a little different
[00:00:43.700] [SPEAKER_02]: from like Korean variety shows, which I think have always been really popular, not just
[00:00:48.580] [SPEAKER_02]: in Korea, but with a lot of K-pop and like K-drama fans. I feel like in the
[00:00:53.500] [SPEAKER_02]: recent years, we've been seeing a lot more Korean reality TV show pop off, just
[00:01:00.240] [SPEAKER_02]: some examples off the top of my head, like Physical 100, Singles Inferno. So we thought
[00:01:05.980] [SPEAKER_02]: it would be fun to talk about our experiences watching these if we like them, what we like
[00:01:11.300] [SPEAKER_02]: about them and all of that.
[00:01:13.440] [SPEAKER_03]: Sounds great.
[00:01:18.640] [SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a big enjoyer of Korean reality TV shows. I think it does stem from a love
[00:01:24.980] [SPEAKER_04]: of just Korean TV and variety shows in general, from when I was young and watching
[00:01:29.180] [SPEAKER_04]: those things with my family. But now that I don't live with my parents anymore, I feel
[00:01:33.360] [SPEAKER_04]: like it helps me feel in touch with my culture still. And Korean reality TV is the
[00:01:39.760] [SPEAKER_04]: definition of slow burn, at least in the romance world. The OSTs, they just fucking
[00:01:44.520] [SPEAKER_04]: hit. The romance is so emotional. And there's kind of like the are they in
[00:01:50.960] [SPEAKER_04]: love? Are they not? Mystery element as well that I feel like doesn't come as
[00:01:55.180] [SPEAKER_04]: much with American reality TV shows. So I will be watching and defending Korean
[00:02:01.000] [SPEAKER_04]: reality till I die.
[00:02:03.860] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no one's gonna attack you here.
[00:02:08.260] [SPEAKER_02]: So do you all have a favorite one off the top of your head?
[00:02:13.340] [SPEAKER_02]: The last one I really enjoyed was Love After Divorce.
[00:02:17.300] [SPEAKER_03]: I just watched that.
[00:02:18.500] [SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they recently did a season maybe like a year ago, where it was mainly
[00:02:23.180] [SPEAKER_03]: Koreans living abroad on the show. So there's a lot of English, which was nice
[00:02:27.360] [SPEAKER_03]: for me because my Korean is really bad. But the premise is like these people who
[00:02:31.580] [SPEAKER_03]: have gone through divorce are looking for like their second chance at love,
[00:02:35.040] [SPEAKER_03]: like marriage potentially on the show. So the age range tends to be a bit
[00:02:40.060] [SPEAKER_03]: higher. And I think the emotional experiences that these people have been
[00:02:45.160] [SPEAKER_03]: through just a little bit deeper and like, I don't know, it was a really
[00:02:48.960] [SPEAKER_03]: shallow show for me. I thought the way they did it and like what the
[00:02:53.320] [SPEAKER_03]: contestants themselves talked about and how they went about things was really
[00:02:57.200] [SPEAKER_03]: nice. It also makes me hopeful, like if I have a failed marriage.
[00:03:06.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so in Love After Marriage, do they just find random people on the
[00:03:11.360] [SPEAKER_02]: street? Or is it like-
[00:03:12.460] [SPEAKER_02]: You have to apply.
[00:03:13.420] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay. It's all these divorced people in the same house or something and
[00:03:17.260] [SPEAKER_02]: then they're like-
[00:03:18.140] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:18.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay. I see.
[00:03:19.600] [SPEAKER_02]: Date each other.
[00:03:21.740] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like anytime they do reality TV, like romance reality TV with divorced
[00:03:27.460] [SPEAKER_04]: people, the energy is just different because I watch I Am Solo on a weekly
[00:03:32.200] [SPEAKER_04]: basis and that show is also like you get six men and six women each in one
[00:03:37.480] [SPEAKER_04]: house for a week and have them date each other. And the seasons where
[00:03:41.060] [SPEAKER_04]: they're divorced, I feel like the pace of how they like talk about stuff
[00:03:45.380] [SPEAKER_04]: is so fast because for like single undivorced people, I feel like they test
[00:03:50.380] [SPEAKER_04]: the waters a little bit and with divorced people straight out of the
[00:03:53.120] [SPEAKER_04]: gate, they're like, how many kids do you have? Like, you know, like these
[00:03:56.180] [SPEAKER_04]: are my deal breakers. Like I don't want to waste time with you if I
[00:03:58.880] [SPEAKER_04]: could, you know, spend this time talking to other people, like blah,
[00:04:01.420] [SPEAKER_04]: blah. So then I love watching it. Like it feels so much more raw and
[00:04:05.340] [SPEAKER_04]: organic, I think.
[00:04:06.480] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like no bullshit.
[00:04:07.800] [SPEAKER_03]: Actually that's so fair. Yeah. And the Love After Divorce one too, like
[00:04:11.660] [SPEAKER_03]: big part of it was revealing new information every night. So like how many
[00:04:16.760] [SPEAKER_03]: kids, where they're from their job. And these are all factors that people
[00:04:20.340] [SPEAKER_03]: actually do care about but like don't usually bring up in like other dating
[00:04:24.700] [SPEAKER_03]: shows like G Suite.
[00:04:26.140] [SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's more mature in these shows where there's like
[00:04:31.060] [SPEAKER_02]: divorced people? There's less of the miscommunications and like mix ups?
[00:04:37.320] [SPEAKER_03]: They're just about different things I feel like. I don't know if they're
[00:04:40.880] [SPEAKER_02]: always more mature, right?
[00:04:42.740] [SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense. I guess it still has to be juicy enough to be like reality TV.
[00:04:47.340] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[00:04:48.660] [SPEAKER_02]: I think honestly, I haven't watched too many reality shows in the recent
[00:04:54.100] [SPEAKER_02]: months. But the last one I was watching was Exchange. It's also
[00:04:59.700] [SPEAKER_02]: called Transit Love. I think the English title is X Change. This one
[00:05:04.520] [SPEAKER_02]: is like so interesting because the show basically brings on a bunch of
[00:05:10.560] [SPEAKER_02]: ex couples and then they all live in the same house and they try to date
[00:05:15.560] [SPEAKER_02]: each other. And you have the option of basically trying to get back together
[00:05:20.100] [SPEAKER_02]: with the ex that you came onto the show with, or you can try to go date
[00:05:24.520] [SPEAKER_02]: someone else. And it's so interesting because the exes aren't revealed in
[00:05:29.180] [SPEAKER_02]: the beginning. So it's almost easier to like try to date other people. But
[00:05:34.720] [SPEAKER_02]: then once the exes get revealed, it's like, oh, I'm actually going after
[00:05:39.220] [SPEAKER_02]: this other girl's ex boyfriend and we're like buddies now. Like, that's a
[00:05:43.580] [SPEAKER_02]: little awkward. There's a lot of drama in that one. I feel like there's just
[00:05:47.420] [SPEAKER_02]: a lot of possibility because of the previous connection as well as the
[00:05:51.680] [SPEAKER_02]: potential new connections.
[00:05:54.140] [SPEAKER_03]: My first take when I heard about the show was like, oh, that premise is
[00:05:58.420] [SPEAKER_03]: like just so toxic. It's like how can I create the most conflict within
[00:06:04.680] [SPEAKER_03]: a TV show? Just throw a bunch of exes in.
[00:06:09.120] [SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy. Sometimes you just have someone really like trying to
[00:06:14.300] [SPEAKER_02]: get back together with their ex, but then their ex is like trying to move
[00:06:17.980] [SPEAKER_02]: on and you're like, oh my god, this is painful to watch, lowkey.
[00:06:24.000] [SPEAKER_04]: And you get to hear the tea from both sides on why they broke up. And
[00:06:29.600] [SPEAKER_04]: you can also just, you know, see a lot of moments of like jealousy when
[00:06:33.860] [SPEAKER_04]: it's like, oh, maybe I don't want to even get back with my ex, but like
[00:06:36.880] [SPEAKER_04]: seeing him go after a different girl is like a different kind of pain.
[00:06:40.220] [SPEAKER_04]: So there's all these little elements, I think that make it really interesting.
[00:06:44.240] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. I would say the only downside of this one is that it's really long.
[00:06:48.920] [SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I think the most popular season is like 30 episodes or
[00:06:54.200] [SPEAKER_02]: something. It's like insanely long and each episode is like almost two
[00:06:57.960] [SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[00:06:59.000] [SPEAKER_03]: How long are they in the house for?
[00:07:01.440] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's usually like, oh, exchange is pretty long, isn't it?
[00:07:05.740] [SPEAKER_02]: It might be like two to three weeks. At the end, the last week, they like go
[00:07:11.820] [SPEAKER_02]: to Jeju Island together. It's pretty crazy. I think season two was the one
[00:07:17.400] [SPEAKER_02]: that really blew up. And then season three was the most recent season,
[00:07:23.760] [SPEAKER_02]: which I've actually yet to finish because I was a little sad. There's this
[00:07:28.700] [SPEAKER_02]: couple I was rooting for, but I just had this feeling that it might not work out.
[00:07:33.520] [SPEAKER_02]: So I lowkey just stopped watching in order to not break my heart.
[00:07:41.000] [SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely worth finishing though. Dude, exchange three was going on
[00:07:45.860] [SPEAKER_04]: when James and I were on our honeymoon. And one of the days we were
[00:07:49.180] [SPEAKER_04]: in Switzerland, we literally just like hold up in the room and like
[00:07:51.960] [SPEAKER_04]: watch the whole episode because we were so addicted to it.
[00:07:56.000] [SPEAKER_04]: I love that. I need to watch it.
[00:07:59.060] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good one. The downside of this one is that it's not on
[00:08:03.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Netflix though. I believe it's on Viki. So it's like slightly less
[00:08:07.600] [SPEAKER_02]: accessible.
[00:08:08.660] [SPEAKER_03]: There's also like Korean dramas I want to watch on Viki. So I've
[00:08:11.240] [SPEAKER_03]: been considering
[00:08:12.000] [SPEAKER_02]: this kind of plays into another thing we were thinking about, which
[00:08:15.220] [SPEAKER_02]: is maybe part of the reason why these K reality shows have been
[00:08:20.140] [SPEAKER_02]: getting so popular is because of how easily accessible they are. Like so
[00:08:25.900] [SPEAKER_02]: many are on Netflix alone. The average person I would say probably
[00:08:30.380] [SPEAKER_02]: has access to a Netflix account is just suddenly so available to
[00:08:34.980] [SPEAKER_02]: us. And I think honestly, in the US reality TV has been on the
[00:08:41.340] [SPEAKER_02]: upswing as well. Like there's been some really intense I don't
[00:08:46.400] [SPEAKER_02]: follow these but I know like what Vanderpump rules is like
[00:08:49.720] [SPEAKER_02]: huge. And I feel like people are just already in that like
[00:08:53.680] [SPEAKER_02]: reality TV mindset so they're ready to accept foreign reality TV too.
[00:08:59.820] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely having it on like, on demand streaming sites
[00:09:05.820] [SPEAKER_03]: makes it really really accessible. I feel like before I used to
[00:09:09.800] [SPEAKER_03]: only see reality TV and this is like when I was a lot younger
[00:09:13.580] [SPEAKER_03]: on actual TV channels, which I just don't have anymore. I
[00:09:18.200] [SPEAKER_03]: also feel like a factor is suggestion algorithms on Netflix
[00:09:24.580] [SPEAKER_03]: or like whatever platform you use, you watch like Korean drama,
[00:09:29.260] [SPEAKER_03]: which is also already really popular, then I feel like you're
[00:09:32.020] [SPEAKER_03]: more likely to be suggested like a creative TV show. True. See
[00:09:35.940] [SPEAKER_03]: Korean people falling in love in real life. It is
[00:09:39.380] [SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[00:09:40.060] [SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good point. There's also, for me
[00:09:43.200] [SPEAKER_04]: personally, like just a craving to watch Asian people on
[00:09:47.680] [SPEAKER_04]: reality. Like I feel like on mainstream American TV, we
[00:09:51.180] [SPEAKER_04]: don't really get that. And recently there's been some
[00:09:54.260] [SPEAKER_04]: exceptions with like The Bachelorette being Asian and
[00:09:56.880] [SPEAKER_04]: whatnot. But sometimes I just want to see like a whole like
[00:09:59.660] [SPEAKER_04]: TV show about Asians. And really the easiest way to
[00:10:03.860] [SPEAKER_04]: find that is in Asian TV shows. So then I think the
[00:10:07.760] [SPEAKER_04]: element of the foreign cultures to also bring an
[00:10:11.680] [SPEAKER_04]: interesting element to the show, where it's not just
[00:10:14.540] [SPEAKER_04]: fast paced drama, it's sometimes slow burn and you
[00:10:18.020] [SPEAKER_04]: know, emotional and there's like a narrative to the story
[00:10:21.360] [SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[00:10:22.560] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true. I want to see reality TV where people take
[00:10:25.340] [SPEAKER_02]: their shoes off before going in the house.
[00:10:28.660] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:30.300] [SPEAKER_03]: This is why I was so into Terrace House because I feel
[00:10:33.220] [SPEAKER_03]: like for me that was the first show where I was like,
[00:10:35.720] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, this is how I would actually approach romance or
[00:10:38.460] [SPEAKER_03]: living with people. I wouldn't just immediately try to like
[00:10:40.800] [SPEAKER_03]: someone for night one.
[00:10:44.140] [SPEAKER_03]: The slow burn, the things that they get upset about.
[00:10:48.520] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little different.
[00:10:50.300] [SPEAKER_04]: True. And I feel like with that too, I feel like the
[00:10:53.840] [SPEAKER_04]: controversies that the shows start also are a little
[00:10:56.800] [SPEAKER_04]: bit different. Something that I thought was so funny
[00:11:00.080] [SPEAKER_04]: watching Exchange or Transit Love was one of the main
[00:11:03.960] [SPEAKER_04]: controversies was that they were like gross, as in they
[00:11:08.780] [SPEAKER_04]: did not tidy the house.
[00:11:10.660] [SPEAKER_04]: So then often they would stay up late and like drink
[00:11:12.980] [SPEAKER_04]: and there's like Anju and like food and stuff and
[00:11:16.220] [SPEAKER_04]: they would go to sleep at like 6 a.m. or something.
[00:11:18.440] [SPEAKER_04]: So then naturally they leave all the mess on the
[00:11:20.980] [SPEAKER_04]: tables. And then people in Korea got so mad and
[00:11:24.020] [SPEAKER_04]: were like, oh my God, these people are fucking
[00:11:25.480] [SPEAKER_04]: living in filth. Like this is unacceptable.
[00:11:29.000] [SPEAKER_02]: I think that was season two, right?
[00:11:30.660] [SPEAKER_02]: I think I also heard like all the plants in the
[00:11:34.160] [SPEAKER_02]: house they rented for the show died and people
[00:11:37.120] [SPEAKER_02]: were like, dude, what the fuck?
[00:11:41.000] [SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.
[00:11:42.500] [SPEAKER_04]: In My Sibling Romance, which was one of my recent
[00:11:45.140] [SPEAKER_04]: faves, there was a contestant who for some
[00:11:48.920] [SPEAKER_04]: reason she was never pictured doing the dishes.
[00:11:51.960] [SPEAKER_04]: And then people started being like, oh my God,
[00:11:54.940] [SPEAKER_04]: you can tell she's like a horrible person and
[00:11:57.760] [SPEAKER_04]: she has no rapport with any of the girls.
[00:12:00.080] [SPEAKER_04]: You can see that she has no social skills because
[00:12:01.940] [SPEAKER_04]: look, she doesn't even do the dishes.
[00:12:03.380] [SPEAKER_04]: And then after that controversy happened, the
[00:12:05.820] [SPEAKER_04]: literal episode that aired after the producers
[00:12:08.640] [SPEAKER_04]: edited in purposefully a clip of her doing the
[00:12:12.100] [SPEAKER_04]: dishes and clips of her talking to girls.
[00:12:14.720] [SPEAKER_04]: It's be like, oh, you know, we just didn't have
[00:12:16.780] [SPEAKER_04]: time to put it in the show, but she's like a
[00:12:18.780] [SPEAKER_04]: normal person, guys.
[00:12:20.360] [SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a huge thing.
[00:12:22.220] [SPEAKER_03]: You're watching an hour episode for a show and
[00:12:25.320] [SPEAKER_03]: it's covering so much time.
[00:12:27.920] [SPEAKER_03]: You really don't know what happened.
[00:12:29.920] [SPEAKER_03]: So then the narrative is actually created by
[00:12:32.400] [SPEAKER_03]: whoever's editing and directing the show.
[00:12:35.160] [SPEAKER_03]: If you like dislike someone, it's because
[00:12:37.320] [SPEAKER_03]: they're making you dislike them.
[00:12:39.740] [SPEAKER_03]: True.
[00:12:40.720] [SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I can have like strong emotions
[00:12:42.620] [SPEAKER_03]: about characters on these shows.
[00:12:44.380] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, that girl is such a bitch.
[00:12:48.020] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like, she's so snaky, whatever.
[00:12:50.960] [SPEAKER_03]: But really we only, we don't see everything.
[00:12:53.600] [SPEAKER_03]: Good reminder.
[00:12:55.220] [SPEAKER_02]: They're people.
[00:12:56.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[00:12:57.320] [SPEAKER_02]: Also, Jisoo, I think you need to explain
[00:12:59.740] [SPEAKER_02]: my sibling romance a little or else it's just
[00:13:02.940] [SPEAKER_02]: the title.
[00:13:03.900] [SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like incest.
[00:13:06.060] [SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound like what it actually is.
[00:13:11.180] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[00:13:12.280] [SPEAKER_04]: So my sibling romance is first of all, a
[00:13:15.220] [SPEAKER_04]: show that everyone should watch because it
[00:13:17.600] [SPEAKER_04]: will warm your hearts.
[00:13:19.560] [SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically a similar element to
[00:13:22.880] [SPEAKER_04]: exchange, but instead of exes, it's
[00:13:25.480] [SPEAKER_04]: siblings and the siblings have to be
[00:13:27.560] [SPEAKER_04]: opposite gender, but there's no rules on
[00:13:29.700] [SPEAKER_04]: like age gap.
[00:13:30.320] [SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes you'll see like a really big
[00:13:32.080] [SPEAKER_04]: age gap between the siblings and whatnot.
[00:13:33.840] [SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because now that you
[00:13:36.340] [SPEAKER_04]: have all the siblings living in one house,
[00:13:38.780] [SPEAKER_04]: when you try to date each other,
[00:13:40.280] [SPEAKER_04]: there's these weird things of like, oh,
[00:13:42.820] [SPEAKER_04]: I want that guy to be like dating my
[00:13:45.760] [SPEAKER_04]: sister.
[00:13:46.060] [SPEAKER_04]: Like he's cool.
[00:13:46.860] [SPEAKER_04]: I want him as my brother-in-law or
[00:13:49.340] [SPEAKER_04]: the opposite of like, yeah, like my
[00:13:52.100] [SPEAKER_04]: brother is talking to this girl, but
[00:13:53.660] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I really like her
[00:13:55.020] [SPEAKER_04]: that much.
[00:13:56.180] [SPEAKER_04]: So like then the girl has to impress
[00:13:58.100] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, the guy's sister.
[00:14:00.040] [SPEAKER_04]: So then there's like kind of like not
[00:14:02.560] [SPEAKER_04]: drama, but different things that you
[00:14:04.840] [SPEAKER_04]: have to keep in mind when you're
[00:14:06.360] [SPEAKER_04]: dating.
[00:14:06.940] [SPEAKER_04]: So not only do you have to go for
[00:14:08.620] [SPEAKER_04]: whoever you want to date, but you
[00:14:10.840] [SPEAKER_04]: also have to like be conscious of,
[00:14:13.260] [SPEAKER_04]: oh, his family members in this
[00:14:14.520] [SPEAKER_04]: house.
[00:14:14.740] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I should be portraying myself as
[00:14:16.740] [SPEAKER_04]: like a really upstanding person.
[00:14:19.480] [SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes the siblings help each
[00:14:21.220] [SPEAKER_04]: other.
[00:14:21.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they're like, oh, I saw
[00:14:22.880] [SPEAKER_04]: this guy talking to this other girl.
[00:14:24.660] [SPEAKER_04]: He's sneaking around your back.
[00:14:25.940] [SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure you want to date him?
[00:14:27.760] [SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, very, very interesting.
[00:14:30.580] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I really want to watch that.
[00:14:32.620] [SPEAKER_02]: That sounds so cute.
[00:14:34.280] [SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[00:14:36.420] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, honestly, that sounds really
[00:14:38.000] [SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[00:14:38.760] [SPEAKER_02]: But the first time, Jisoo, you
[00:14:40.800] [SPEAKER_02]: told me about my sibling romance.
[00:14:42.880] [SPEAKER_02]: You're like, yeah, siblings go on
[00:14:44.240] [SPEAKER_02]: the show and they like date each
[00:14:45.620] [SPEAKER_02]: other.
[00:14:45.840] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wait.
[00:14:48.220] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you're telling me
[00:14:49.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Korea has allowed a show about
[00:14:53.600] [SPEAKER_02]: like incest?
[00:14:56.020] [SPEAKER_02]: That'd be so crazy.
[00:14:57.420] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was like shocked.
[00:14:58.720] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why do you like
[00:15:00.180] [SPEAKER_02]: this show?
[00:15:00.760] [SPEAKER_02]: And like, why is it airing in
[00:15:03.000] [SPEAKER_02]: Korea?
[00:15:04.880] [SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what is there not to
[00:15:06.080] [SPEAKER_04]: like?
[00:15:06.600] [SPEAKER_04]: Siblings dating each other.
[00:15:08.640] [SPEAKER_03]: It's juicy drama.
[00:15:11.080] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, my best friend's
[00:15:12.760] [SPEAKER_03]: older brother.
[00:15:16.240] [SPEAKER_02]: I did want to ask because, Ann,
[00:15:17.600] [SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned the first reality
[00:15:19.940] [SPEAKER_02]: show you really watched was like
[00:15:21.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Terrace House in terms of like
[00:15:23.540] [SPEAKER_02]: Asian reality shows.
[00:15:25.980] [SPEAKER_02]: What was your first reality show,
[00:15:28.780] [SPEAKER_02]: Jisoo?
[00:15:29.020] [SPEAKER_02]: First Asian reality show.
[00:15:31.240] [SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the first ones I
[00:15:33.120] [SPEAKER_04]: watched was probably Produce 101
[00:15:35.120] [SPEAKER_04]: and like college times.
[00:15:37.260] [SPEAKER_04]: And that is like a whole other
[00:15:39.840] [SPEAKER_04]: genre of Korean reality TV where
[00:15:42.300] [SPEAKER_04]: it's not romance.
[00:15:43.280] [SPEAKER_04]: It's basically 100 idol trainees
[00:15:45.780] [SPEAKER_04]: competing to debut in like the
[00:15:48.220] [SPEAKER_04]: top group.
[00:15:49.160] [SPEAKER_04]: But I was like a religious
[00:15:50.960] [SPEAKER_04]: Produce 101 watcher.
[00:15:52.260] [SPEAKER_04]: And I remember I roped you and
[00:15:53.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Jessica into watching it.
[00:15:54.980] [SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes we would stay up to
[00:15:56.080] [SPEAKER_04]: like 4 a.m.
[00:15:56.940] [SPEAKER_04]: Just like watching the latest
[00:15:58.060] [SPEAKER_04]: episodes that dropped.
[00:15:59.200] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[00:16:00.740] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'm similar.
[00:16:03.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Like these contest reality shows
[00:16:05.940] [SPEAKER_02]: specifically produced was the
[00:16:08.340] [SPEAKER_02]: first like Korean reality TV show
[00:16:10.200] [SPEAKER_02]: I watched.
[00:16:11.000] [SPEAKER_02]: But the one that left the
[00:16:12.480] [SPEAKER_02]: deepest impression on me in
[00:16:14.500] [SPEAKER_02]: terms of like romantic reality
[00:16:16.760] [SPEAKER_02]: TV shows was probably Singles
[00:16:19.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Inferno because when it came
[00:16:21.060] [SPEAKER_02]: out, it like exploded like
[00:16:23.300] [SPEAKER_02]: people were obsessed with it.
[00:16:24.980] [SPEAKER_02]: And that first season, I
[00:16:26.480] [SPEAKER_02]: actually didn't end up watching
[00:16:27.620] [SPEAKER_02]: any of the other seasons.
[00:16:29.320] [SPEAKER_02]: But that first season has like
[00:16:31.260] [SPEAKER_02]: such an annoying yet like
[00:16:34.840] [SPEAKER_02]: juicy storyline in it.
[00:16:38.280] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was I was just very
[00:16:40.040] [SPEAKER_02]: shocked at what happened.
[00:16:43.080] [SPEAKER_04]: That show is another controversy
[00:16:44.540] [SPEAKER_04]: that I thought was kind of
[00:16:45.960] [SPEAKER_04]: interesting where Sung Ji Ah,
[00:16:48.380] [SPEAKER_04]: who was like, I guess one of
[00:16:50.040] [SPEAKER_04]: the bigger stars of that
[00:16:51.560] [SPEAKER_04]: season got canceled in Korea
[00:16:54.460] [SPEAKER_04]: for wearing like counterfeit
[00:16:55.860] [SPEAKER_04]: clothing.
[00:16:56.420] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.
[00:16:57.240] [SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, wow, like
[00:16:58.900] [SPEAKER_04]: these are things that I feel
[00:16:59.900] [SPEAKER_04]: like no one in America would
[00:17:01.460] [SPEAKER_04]: like really care about or it
[00:17:02.600] [SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't just it just wouldn't
[00:17:03.500] [SPEAKER_04]: blow up.
[00:17:03.940] [SPEAKER_04]: It would like live and die on
[00:17:04.980] [SPEAKER_04]: like a Reddit thread or
[00:17:05.740] [SPEAKER_04]: something.
[00:17:07.320] [SPEAKER_03]: I think people like especially
[00:17:09.260] [SPEAKER_03]: came after her because she
[00:17:10.440] [SPEAKER_03]: would wear actual commercials
[00:17:12.280] [SPEAKER_03]: or like, I don't know.
[00:17:14.280] [SPEAKER_03]: I thought she got too much
[00:17:16.720] [SPEAKER_03]: hate for that.
[00:17:17.480] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but yeah, definitely
[00:17:19.440] [SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't happen in America.
[00:17:21.080] [SPEAKER_02]: Definitely felt like it
[00:17:22.480] [SPEAKER_02]: snowballed out of proportion.
[00:17:24.680] [SPEAKER_03]: That's how a lot of things go
[00:17:26.680] [SPEAKER_03]: in Korea, though.
[00:17:27.940] [SPEAKER_03]: I think if they're like ready
[00:17:29.160] [SPEAKER_03]: to hate on you, they'll latch
[00:17:31.040] [SPEAKER_03]: on to like anything that you
[00:17:33.200] [SPEAKER_03]: really did, especially women.
[00:17:35.760] [SPEAKER_02]: Some serious haters out there.
[00:17:39.720] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like a saying in Korea,
[00:17:41.800] [SPEAKER_03]: like you all die talking
[00:17:42.720] [SPEAKER_03]: you all die or something like
[00:17:43.920] [SPEAKER_03]: that.
[00:17:45.740] [SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's true,
[00:17:47.200] [SPEAKER_03]: but I think in general in the
[00:17:48.880] [SPEAKER_03]: world, like, I don't know,
[00:17:50.400] [SPEAKER_03]: like the Blake Lively drama,
[00:17:52.200] [SPEAKER_03]: people are just so ready to
[00:17:53.460] [SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, come after
[00:17:54.840] [SPEAKER_03]: her and there wasn't like
[00:17:55.980] [SPEAKER_03]: really much sad, I feel like.
[00:17:59.160] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[00:18:00.020] [SPEAKER_02]: It was some some rumors,
[00:18:02.420] [SPEAKER_02]: some whispers and now suddenly
[00:18:04.180] [SPEAKER_02]: like it is the biggest piece of
[00:18:07.220] [SPEAKER_02]: news in the current scape.
[00:18:10.000] [SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[00:18:10.500] [SPEAKER_02]: I think women definitely
[00:18:11.980] [SPEAKER_02]: have less forgiving standards.
[00:18:15.120] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like scandals or
[00:18:16.300] [SPEAKER_02]: or just like reactions,
[00:18:17.580] [SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's so interesting.
[00:18:19.940] [SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we've talked about this
[00:18:21.700] [SPEAKER_02]: before on another episode where
[00:18:23.320] [SPEAKER_02]: like there's almost this cycle
[00:18:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]: of like, you know, this person
[00:18:26.460] [SPEAKER_02]: gets really popular and then
[00:18:28.000] [SPEAKER_02]: now it's cool to hate on them.
[00:18:29.620] [SPEAKER_02]: So then they like lose
[00:18:31.580] [SPEAKER_02]: their popularity.
[00:18:32.640] [SPEAKER_02]: But then maybe a few years later
[00:18:34.600] [SPEAKER_02]: they have like a like a rebirth,
[00:18:36.760] [SPEAKER_02]: I guess in the in the media.
[00:18:39.520] [SPEAKER_02]: But it feels like for a woman
[00:18:41.640] [SPEAKER_02]: that's like a longer cycle
[00:18:43.420] [SPEAKER_02]: versus for men.
[00:18:45.100] [SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, OK,
[00:18:46.560] [SPEAKER_02]: we're going to hate on him
[00:18:47.340] [SPEAKER_02]: for like a week and then
[00:18:48.640] [SPEAKER_02]: whatever. That's cool.
[00:18:49.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Like whatever next project
[00:18:51.300] [SPEAKER_02]: they're doing.
[00:18:52.260] [SPEAKER_02]: We love it.
[00:18:53.240] [SPEAKER_03]: But also going back to
[00:18:56.320] [SPEAKER_03]: Singles Inferno,
[00:18:58.440] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like because it was also
[00:19:00.540] [SPEAKER_03]: such a shock because
[00:19:02.360] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like in general
[00:19:04.480] [SPEAKER_03]: Korean TV shows are like
[00:19:06.860] [SPEAKER_03]: focused on like the hot
[00:19:08.220] [SPEAKER_03]: and like scandalous
[00:19:09.320] [SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[00:19:10.300] [SPEAKER_03]: So for a Korean reality
[00:19:12.100] [SPEAKER_03]: TV show to like show
[00:19:13.780] [SPEAKER_03]: like bikinis, any sort of
[00:19:16.320] [SPEAKER_03]: if I like them because they're
[00:19:17.440] [SPEAKER_03]: like hot or like I think
[00:19:18.820] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm the shit.
[00:19:19.420] [SPEAKER_03]: It's very different.
[00:19:20.840] [SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it a lot more
[00:19:21.880] [SPEAKER_03]: fun to watch.
[00:19:23.240] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[00:19:24.220] [SPEAKER_02]: Like by Korean standards,
[00:19:25.200] [SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty scandalous.
[00:19:26.600] [SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of spicy.
[00:19:27.680] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[00:19:28.340] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're going to get a hotel
[00:19:29.440] [SPEAKER_03]: room together.
[00:19:31.920] [SPEAKER_04]: I think if you watch something
[00:19:33.240] [SPEAKER_04]: like Heart Signal,
[00:19:34.380] [SPEAKER_04]: which to me is like
[00:19:35.560] [SPEAKER_04]: peak wholesome,
[00:19:36.840] [SPEAKER_04]: you can really tell the
[00:19:38.120] [SPEAKER_04]: difference between like
[00:19:39.140] [SPEAKER_04]: the average expectations
[00:19:40.760] [SPEAKER_04]: for a Korean romance show
[00:19:42.440] [SPEAKER_04]: versus like Singles Inferno.
[00:19:44.360] [SPEAKER_04]: But I remember being disappointed
[00:19:46.260] [SPEAKER_04]: because the trailers
[00:19:47.140] [SPEAKER_04]: for Singles Inferno
[00:19:48.140] [SPEAKER_04]: were so spicy.
[00:19:49.160] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I watched the actual
[00:19:50.200] [SPEAKER_04]: show and I was like,
[00:19:51.080] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's not really that
[00:19:52.560] [SPEAKER_04]: spicy, except they're just
[00:19:54.080] [SPEAKER_04]: in bikinis.
[00:19:54.860] [SPEAKER_04]: And that's like the cultural
[00:19:55.960] [SPEAKER_04]: shock.
[00:19:56.940] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I remember
[00:19:58.040] [SPEAKER_02]: watching it.
[00:19:58.740] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh my God,
[00:19:59.780] [SPEAKER_02]: like they're going to these
[00:20:00.940] [SPEAKER_02]: hotel rooms for a night.
[00:20:02.640] [SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, wait,
[00:20:03.500] [SPEAKER_02]: they're literally just like
[00:20:04.460] [SPEAKER_02]: eating dinner and chatting.
[00:20:07.100] [SPEAKER_03]: I did feel like they were
[00:20:08.840] [SPEAKER_03]: more direct, though,
[00:20:10.380] [SPEAKER_03]: on that show.
[00:20:11.180] [SPEAKER_03]: They tried to like show
[00:20:12.560] [SPEAKER_03]: interest.
[00:20:13.640] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is another
[00:20:15.100] [SPEAKER_02]: aspect of Korean reality
[00:20:17.340] [SPEAKER_02]: TV that is like so interesting.
[00:20:20.200] [SPEAKER_02]: There's like no physical
[00:20:23.400] [SPEAKER_02]: touch, I guess.
[00:20:24.720] [SPEAKER_02]: People don't make out.
[00:20:25.700] [SPEAKER_02]: People don't have sex.
[00:20:27.160] [SPEAKER_02]: They just like talk
[00:20:28.620] [SPEAKER_02]: and they go on dates
[00:20:29.760] [SPEAKER_02]: where they like eat and talk.
[00:20:31.800] [SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they'll do like
[00:20:33.140] [SPEAKER_02]: a cute activity together.
[00:20:34.500] [SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like it's so
[00:20:36.700] [SPEAKER_02]: PG, if anything.
[00:20:39.020] [SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that adds
[00:20:40.000] [SPEAKER_02]: to the whole thing
[00:20:40.720] [SPEAKER_02]: that you're saying, Jisoo,
[00:20:41.800] [SPEAKER_02]: where it's like slow burn.
[00:20:43.900] [SPEAKER_02]: I guess like maybe
[00:20:44.880] [SPEAKER_02]: it builds more mystery
[00:20:47.080] [SPEAKER_02]: and like suspense.
[00:20:48.200] [SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's just
[00:20:49.420] [SPEAKER_02]: something that we don't get
[00:20:50.920] [SPEAKER_02]: as much or like a different
[00:20:52.540] [SPEAKER_02]: type of in like US reality
[00:20:54.420] [SPEAKER_02]: TV.
[00:20:55.640] [SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely like a change
[00:20:57.140] [SPEAKER_02]: in pace and very like
[00:20:58.800] [SPEAKER_02]: interesting to follow along in.
[00:21:01.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I actually wonder like how much
[00:21:03.280] [SPEAKER_04]: of that is stemming from
[00:21:05.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Korean like TV restrictions,
[00:21:08.420] [SPEAKER_04]: because sometimes in Korea
[00:21:10.300] [SPEAKER_04]: you'll hear people say
[00:21:11.320] [SPEAKER_04]: like they can do that
[00:21:12.500] [SPEAKER_04]: because they're on like
[00:21:14.020] [SPEAKER_04]: a cable platform or like
[00:21:15.820] [SPEAKER_04]: they're on like YouTube
[00:21:16.580] [SPEAKER_04]: or something.
[00:21:17.440] [SPEAKER_04]: But if you're on one of the
[00:21:18.920] [SPEAKER_04]: like major channels,
[00:21:20.160] [SPEAKER_04]: there's things that you
[00:21:21.460] [SPEAKER_04]: can't like show.
[00:21:22.520] [SPEAKER_04]: For example, you have to like
[00:21:23.460] [SPEAKER_04]: bleep out cuss words.
[00:21:24.300] [SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not that different
[00:21:25.440] [SPEAKER_04]: from America, but it's probably
[00:21:26.780] [SPEAKER_04]: a little bit stricter in Korea
[00:21:28.200] [SPEAKER_04]: because I did watch
[00:21:30.840] [SPEAKER_04]: a couple of episodes of this
[00:21:32.540] [SPEAKER_04]: Korean reality TV show
[00:21:34.100] [SPEAKER_04]: where the premise was like
[00:21:36.140] [SPEAKER_04]: if you match on a date,
[00:21:38.280] [SPEAKER_04]: you like have to stay
[00:21:40.180] [SPEAKER_04]: the night together.
[00:21:41.160] [SPEAKER_04]: You sleep on the same bed
[00:21:42.980] [SPEAKER_04]: and the whole premise is
[00:21:44.020] [SPEAKER_04]: like you only know someone
[00:21:45.200] [SPEAKER_04]: once you share a bed with them.
[00:21:46.620] [SPEAKER_04]: And I've watched a couple
[00:21:47.560] [SPEAKER_04]: episodes of that.
[00:21:48.300] [SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like,
[00:21:49.400] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, this is like
[00:21:50.140] [SPEAKER_04]: not what I'm looking for
[00:21:51.080] [SPEAKER_04]: right now in a TV show.
[00:21:53.200] [SPEAKER_04]: But it's crazy that
[00:21:54.180] [SPEAKER_04]: this exists somewhere.
[00:21:55.680] [SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[00:21:56.980] [SPEAKER_03]: I always thought it was like
[00:21:58.100] [SPEAKER_03]: due to public perception,
[00:21:59.400] [SPEAKER_03]: potentially.
[00:22:00.660] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this
[00:22:01.340] [SPEAKER_03]: is still the case,
[00:22:02.000] [SPEAKER_03]: but I remember hearing that
[00:22:03.600] [SPEAKER_03]: when Korean female actresses
[00:22:05.880] [SPEAKER_03]: would go on like
[00:22:07.540] [SPEAKER_03]: erotic movies or like
[00:22:08.600] [SPEAKER_03]: just things with the sex scene.
[00:22:09.920] [SPEAKER_03]: If they did too many of them,
[00:22:12.860] [SPEAKER_03]: then somehow their reputation
[00:22:14.340] [SPEAKER_03]: was like damaged.
[00:22:15.680] [SPEAKER_03]: So you had to be very
[00:22:17.020] [SPEAKER_03]: like tasteful about which movie
[00:22:18.520] [SPEAKER_03]: you decided to like
[00:22:19.740] [SPEAKER_03]: use your sex scene
[00:22:20.920] [SPEAKER_02]: and you're like,
[00:22:24.020] [SPEAKER_02]: I think this movie will be a banger.
[00:22:25.940] [SPEAKER_02]: So it's OK.
[00:22:26.680] [SPEAKER_02]: It has a sex scene.
[00:22:28.740] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:29.740] [SPEAKER_02]: It's an artistic one.
[00:22:31.500] [SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember
[00:22:32.540] [SPEAKER_02]: watching K dramas.
[00:22:34.160] [SPEAKER_02]: If people kissed horizontally,
[00:22:36.460] [SPEAKER_02]: it was like crazy.
[00:22:38.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, horizontally?
[00:22:39.640] [SPEAKER_02]: Like on a bed or a couch
[00:22:41.040] [SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[00:22:43.520] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, yes.
[00:22:46.340] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like, holy fuck.
[00:22:48.360] [SPEAKER_01]: They're implying
[00:22:49.540] [SPEAKER_01]: not just making out.
[00:22:52.220] [SPEAKER_04]: Well, I feel like the implication
[00:22:53.800] [SPEAKER_04]: or what alludes to them having sex
[00:22:55.760] [SPEAKER_04]: is when they pull the covers
[00:22:57.140] [SPEAKER_04]: up over their heads.
[00:22:58.560] [SPEAKER_02]: Do I feel like that
[00:22:59.320] [SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really happen in K dramas?
[00:23:01.100] [SPEAKER_02]: At least the ones that I've seen.
[00:23:02.420] [SPEAKER_04]: Wait, really?
[00:23:02.980] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it used
[00:23:03.620] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it was like the old way
[00:23:05.140] [SPEAKER_04]: of being like, oh, they're having sex
[00:23:06.500] [SPEAKER_04]: and they would just pull the covers up.
[00:23:08.080] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, or a baby pops out
[00:23:10.040] [SPEAKER_03]: in the next episode.
[00:23:12.320] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like most of the ones
[00:23:14.380] [SPEAKER_02]: that I've seen,
[00:23:15.780] [SPEAKER_02]: they just like kiss
[00:23:17.420] [SPEAKER_02]: and then it's like, OK.
[00:23:18.720] [SPEAKER_02]: And then if they kiss on a bed,
[00:23:21.200] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, whoa, that's crazy.
[00:23:24.660] [SPEAKER_03]: There's like those Muckdang dramas
[00:23:26.380] [SPEAKER_03]: that like have some really saucy scenes.
[00:23:29.360] [SPEAKER_03]: Muckdang is like so
[00:23:30.640] [SPEAKER_03]: in that Pada 1997 kissing scene,
[00:23:34.760] [SPEAKER_03]: like Liz Renfrew in my head.
[00:23:36.440] [SPEAKER_03]: It was just like such a good kiss.
[00:23:38.640] [SPEAKER_03]: Was it like spicy?
[00:23:40.220] [SPEAKER_03]: And there were multiple.
[00:23:45.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like
[00:23:46.230] [SPEAKER_02]: well, actually, to be fair,
[00:23:47.870] [SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like at least
[00:23:49.990] [SPEAKER_02]: the dramas on Netflix,
[00:23:52.130] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of the kisses are a little
[00:23:53.850] [SPEAKER_02]: they feel a little more real,
[00:23:55.870] [SPEAKER_02]: almost like a little more American
[00:23:58.170] [SPEAKER_02]: or Hollywood style kisses.
[00:24:00.310] [SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[00:24:00.670] [SPEAKER_02]: But before it was always the like
[00:24:03.470] [SPEAKER_02]: peck and someone looks like so surprised
[00:24:05.790] [SPEAKER_02]: eyes wide like, holy fuck.
[00:24:07.930] [SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[00:24:09.110] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's definitely been an evolution.
[00:24:12.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's an influence
[00:24:13.590] [SPEAKER_03]: of like Netflix or
[00:24:16.010] [SPEAKER_03]: as if the times are kind of changing?
[00:24:17.990] [SPEAKER_02]: My personal theory is that it's
[00:24:21.870] [SPEAKER_02]: maybe some influence from international audiences
[00:24:24.690] [SPEAKER_02]: because I think maybe like
[00:24:27.890] [SPEAKER_02]: from what I've seen,
[00:24:29.430] [SPEAKER_02]: I only really read like American,
[00:24:31.870] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, English, Reddit or whatever.
[00:24:34.010] [SPEAKER_02]: People are they would like kind of
[00:24:35.930] [SPEAKER_02]: clown K-drama sometimes being like,
[00:24:38.070] [SPEAKER_02]: dude, this kiss is like so,
[00:24:40.370] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like that's not a kiss
[00:24:41.990] [SPEAKER_02]: or like K-drama has the classic
[00:24:44.790] [SPEAKER_02]: someone is just like frozen
[00:24:46.810] [SPEAKER_02]: and like getting a peck on their cheek
[00:24:49.190] [SPEAKER_02]: or like the guy is like making out
[00:24:51.010] [SPEAKER_02]: with the girl, but she's like not
[00:24:52.570] [SPEAKER_02]: making out back or whatever.
[00:24:54.850] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[00:24:55.110] [SPEAKER_02]: And I think after seeing all of that,
[00:24:57.210] [SPEAKER_02]: it's been like more gradual
[00:24:58.870] [SPEAKER_02]: that it's like changed a bit.
[00:25:00.970] [SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it's also like
[00:25:02.790] [SPEAKER_04]: the power of YouTube
[00:25:04.850] [SPEAKER_04]: or something or like reels and whatnot,
[00:25:06.970] [SPEAKER_04]: because I know certain kiss scenes
[00:25:10.350] [SPEAKER_04]: have gone viral over the years
[00:25:12.130] [SPEAKER_04]: of like, oh my God, they're like
[00:25:13.670] [SPEAKER_04]: actually having like a full fledged kiss scene.
[00:25:16.130] [SPEAKER_04]: And then that video will do numbers
[00:25:18.350] [SPEAKER_04]: on like YouTube or something.
[00:25:19.810] [SPEAKER_04]: So maybe producers see that
[00:25:21.910] [SPEAKER_04]: and they're like, oh, like this seems
[00:25:23.530] [SPEAKER_04]: to stir up some sort of like
[00:25:24.910] [SPEAKER_04]: social media thing.
[00:25:25.870] [SPEAKER_04]: Like we should also do an intense kiss scene.
[00:25:28.230] [SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately it's like
[00:25:29.470] [SPEAKER_03]: to get more viewers somehow.
[00:25:31.770] [SPEAKER_02]: Probably I would guess so.
[00:25:34.450] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but question.
[00:25:36.250] [SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen a K-reality
[00:25:38.990] [SPEAKER_02]: show where people have kissed?
[00:25:42.290] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I have.
[00:25:44.050] [SPEAKER_04]: It happened in a recent
[00:25:46.150] [SPEAKER_04]: I Am Solo season.
[00:25:48.050] [SPEAKER_04]: And it was like a huge thing
[00:25:50.050] [SPEAKER_04]: because I Am Solo,
[00:25:52.030] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, like when you watch
[00:25:52.910] [SPEAKER_04]: Heart Signal and like Exchange and stuff,
[00:25:54.810] [SPEAKER_04]: there's like all these like romantic
[00:25:56.690] [SPEAKER_04]: OST songs in the background
[00:25:58.650] [SPEAKER_04]: and there's like a narrative and whatnot.
[00:26:00.050] [SPEAKER_04]: I Am Solo is not like
[00:26:01.130] [SPEAKER_04]: it's like on the fly.
[00:26:02.350] [SPEAKER_04]: Like it's very much like real
[00:26:04.050] [SPEAKER_04]: and organic and just like
[00:26:05.830] [SPEAKER_04]: normal non influencer type people.
[00:26:08.650] [SPEAKER_04]: But two people kissed mid season
[00:26:11.350] [SPEAKER_04]: and it was like a huge shock, I think.
[00:26:14.810] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I saw a bunch of articles about it.
[00:26:16.630] [SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[00:26:17.710] [SPEAKER_02]: I asked because like, well, one,
[00:26:19.350] [SPEAKER_02]: we've been talking about like
[00:26:20.850] [SPEAKER_02]: K-dramas are allowed to have
[00:26:22.050] [SPEAKER_02]: like kiss scenes and stuff.
[00:26:23.570] [SPEAKER_02]: But also when I was watching Exchange,
[00:26:27.550] [SPEAKER_02]: these people are literally
[00:26:28.490] [SPEAKER_02]: like trying to date each other,
[00:26:29.930] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, like getting to know each other.
[00:26:31.830] [SPEAKER_02]: And then at some point in the show,
[00:26:35.090] [SPEAKER_02]: this couple that I was rooting for,
[00:26:36.930] [SPEAKER_02]: they were like basically a couple.
[00:26:38.790] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, just fucking kiss her.
[00:26:40.810] [SPEAKER_02]: But then
[00:26:43.390] [SPEAKER_02]: but then I looked up the rules
[00:26:45.670] [SPEAKER_02]: and the rules were like
[00:26:47.490] [SPEAKER_02]: like the rules for the show.
[00:26:48.790] [SPEAKER_02]: It was like you're not allowed to like
[00:26:51.710] [SPEAKER_02]: actually define your relationship.
[00:26:54.010] [SPEAKER_02]: You can't hold hands.
[00:26:55.990] [SPEAKER_02]: You can't kiss each other.
[00:26:58.010] [SPEAKER_02]: You can't like do any of that.
[00:26:59.950] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[00:27:00.330] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was another thing.
[00:27:01.370] [SPEAKER_02]: They were like walking down the road
[00:27:02.710] [SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, oh, this is so cute.
[00:27:04.310] [SPEAKER_02]: Like why don't you just fucking hold her hand?
[00:27:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]: But then I found out
[00:27:08.430] [SPEAKER_02]: it was like against the rules
[00:27:09.570] [SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, I was like, come on, guys,
[00:27:11.950] [SPEAKER_02]: it's just hand holding.
[00:27:14.110] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's so interesting.
[00:27:17.330] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like love after divorce,
[00:27:19.330] [SPEAKER_03]: the season with Kyo Puls
[00:27:20.710] [SPEAKER_03]: or like international grins.
[00:27:23.430] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they did kiss, but I don't remember.
[00:27:27.170] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just assumed they did
[00:27:28.890] [SPEAKER_04]: because there wasn't
[00:27:29.970] [SPEAKER_04]: like an explicit kissing scene, I think.
[00:27:32.150] [SPEAKER_04]: But it was like implied
[00:27:34.190] [SPEAKER_04]: slash slightly shown
[00:27:35.490] [SPEAKER_04]: that there was like a couple
[00:27:36.690] [SPEAKER_04]: that was laying in bed together
[00:27:38.870] [SPEAKER_04]: for like multiple hours a day.
[00:27:40.370] [SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[00:27:40.990] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, OK, well,
[00:27:42.470] [SPEAKER_04]: they're probably just like not showing us.
[00:27:44.710] [SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yeah, I didn't love that couple.
[00:27:50.010] [SPEAKER_02]: OK, I guess to be fair,
[00:27:51.770] [SPEAKER_02]: now that I'm thinking about it,
[00:27:53.650] [SPEAKER_02]: it would be a little weird
[00:27:55.150] [SPEAKER_02]: to be filmed like kissing someone, huh?
[00:27:59.470] [SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[00:28:00.530] [SPEAKER_04]: Although allegedly,
[00:28:01.710] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, after like a couple days,
[00:28:04.110] [SPEAKER_04]: you forget the cameras are there.
[00:28:05.690] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how real that is,
[00:28:06.990] [SPEAKER_04]: but I think for some people
[00:28:08.030] [SPEAKER_04]: they're like able to kind of start blocking it out.
[00:28:10.430] [SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[00:28:11.410] [SPEAKER_03]: I could see that being real, because like,
[00:28:14.170] [SPEAKER_03]: would they really say that shit on camera?
[00:28:16.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?
[00:28:18.070] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like down like.
[00:28:20.870] [SPEAKER_03]: I always thought
[00:28:21.750] [SPEAKER_03]: like people go on reality TV shows
[00:28:23.130] [SPEAKER_03]: are trying to be famous.
[00:28:24.850] [SPEAKER_03]: But after watching some like,
[00:28:26.690] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, like they're really behaving like this.
[00:28:28.770] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they're actually kind of immersed
[00:28:31.690] [SPEAKER_03]: and sort of like bought into the idea of the show
[00:28:35.670] [SPEAKER_03]: because they've been doing it for a while.
[00:28:38.830] [SPEAKER_04]: I think you bring up a good point, though.
[00:28:40.830] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like I find the best seasons of Korean reality TV
[00:28:45.110] [SPEAKER_04]: are that good because I don't feel like any of the cast
[00:28:49.250] [SPEAKER_04]: is only on there to become like an influencer.
[00:28:51.630] [SPEAKER_04]: Like as soon as I can clock that, I'm like, OK,
[00:28:54.970] [SPEAKER_04]: this season is like fake
[00:28:56.030] [SPEAKER_04]: because then I just start to question everything they're doing.
[00:28:58.670] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, you want to be portrayed as like the good guy
[00:29:01.250] [SPEAKER_04]: or like you're like pushing this image of scorned women
[00:29:04.730] [SPEAKER_04]: or like whatever.
[00:29:06.130] [SPEAKER_04]: And it just like really puts me off.
[00:29:08.010] [SPEAKER_04]: So then I feel like the seasons that do really well
[00:29:10.450] [SPEAKER_04]: are because no one is like out there clearly trying to chase fame.
[00:29:14.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[00:29:15.550] [SPEAKER_03]: Did you watch Singles Inferno season three?
[00:29:18.530] [SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what happened.
[00:29:21.230] [SPEAKER_03]: My favorite character there, she was just so real.
[00:29:24.170] [SPEAKER_03]: Ha Jung.
[00:29:25.190] [SPEAKER_03]: But what I liked about her was that she was kind of like,
[00:29:28.490] [SPEAKER_03]: you know what, I'm going to do me.
[00:29:29.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, I like this person.
[00:29:30.610] [SPEAKER_03]: They don't like me back with OK.
[00:29:31.870] [SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we got to see some like character growth
[00:29:34.890] [SPEAKER_03]: because she like cried and like, she's like, oh, it's just like,
[00:29:37.650] [SPEAKER_03]: you know, following my heart.
[00:29:38.690] [SPEAKER_03]: But she wasn't like annoying about it or like doing it for clout.
[00:29:41.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it was very clearly like not the best reality TV show
[00:29:45.310] [SPEAKER_03]: like outcome for her technically. Right.
[00:29:47.310] [SPEAKER_03]: Like she could have left with someone.
[00:29:49.170] [SPEAKER_03]: But she was like, no, I'm going to be true to myself,
[00:29:51.190] [SPEAKER_03]: even though I get rejected on camera.
[00:29:53.290] [SPEAKER_03]: That was very admirable to me. Yeah.
[00:29:58.930] [SPEAKER_03]: Also, going back to the Terrace House had a lot of implied sex.
[00:30:03.530] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really? Oh, yeah.
[00:30:05.510] [SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't know this because I never watched Terrace House.
[00:30:08.150] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys never?
[00:30:09.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I only watched like one or two shows.
[00:30:11.630] [SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I saw in Terrace House was like,
[00:30:14.250] [SPEAKER_02]: I know, like some people got really mad over like
[00:30:17.930] [SPEAKER_02]: some beef in the fridge or something.
[00:30:20.650] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. The meat drama.
[00:30:23.550] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's like the only thing.
[00:30:24.690] [SPEAKER_01]: They ate her.
[00:30:26.970] [SPEAKER_03]: It was his.
[00:30:29.270] [SPEAKER_03]: It was high quality.
[00:30:32.450] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so how is the implied sex implied?
[00:30:36.270] [SPEAKER_03]: When people would couple up in the show,
[00:30:38.810] [SPEAKER_03]: sometimes the other contestants would like give them space
[00:30:42.090] [SPEAKER_04]: or like give them their own room.
[00:30:44.490] [SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a crazy contrast.
[00:30:47.290] [SPEAKER_04]: So I watched the recent Love Island season.
[00:30:50.690] [SPEAKER_04]: If you've never watched Love Island,
[00:30:52.010] [SPEAKER_04]: they have this thing called like the Hideaway,
[00:30:54.150] [SPEAKER_04]: which I think is like a separate room or something.
[00:30:57.210] [SPEAKER_04]: So once you're like an official couple on the show,
[00:30:59.510] [SPEAKER_04]: you can go and have implied sex.
[00:31:02.130] [SPEAKER_04]: But not only is it implied that you're having sex there,
[00:31:05.010] [SPEAKER_04]: they actively talk about it.
[00:31:06.410] [SPEAKER_04]: So on the recent season,
[00:31:07.550] [SPEAKER_04]: like a couple went to the Hideaway and they like
[00:31:09.850] [SPEAKER_04]: spent a night together.
[00:31:11.010] [SPEAKER_04]: And then the next day, they were like, oh, my God,
[00:31:12.930] [SPEAKER_04]: like last night was so amazing.
[00:31:15.010] [SPEAKER_04]: I loved when we did this or whatever.
[00:31:16.950] [SPEAKER_04]: And they were kind of like alluding to what happened.
[00:31:19.110] [SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, what the fuck?
[00:31:20.550] [SPEAKER_04]: Like, this is TMI.
[00:31:22.270] [SPEAKER_02]: So wild.
[00:31:24.110] [SPEAKER_02]: OK, I will I will say like there's probably no way
[00:31:27.470] [SPEAKER_02]: anyone is going to film reality TV people having sex.
[00:31:32.750] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's like a little invasive.
[00:31:35.370] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:36.330] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's so funny, the difference between like Love Island,
[00:31:41.050] [SPEAKER_02]: they're actively talking about it after versus Terrace House
[00:31:44.870] [SPEAKER_02]: is just like, oh, we'll give you some space.
[00:31:47.390] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't ask, don't tell.
[00:31:49.910] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah. But like kind of like other contestants
[00:31:52.730] [SPEAKER_03]: will kind of like make eyes at each other, like, you know, it is
[00:31:57.290] [SPEAKER_03]: Korean shows. You wouldn't see that.
[00:31:59.730] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like it's usually against the rules.
[00:32:03.330] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like too scandalous.
[00:32:05.710] [SPEAKER_04]: So I have like a random question for you guys.
[00:32:08.910] [SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that you guys do
[00:32:10.510] [SPEAKER_04]: while you're watching a season of reality TV that you think
[00:32:14.130] [SPEAKER_04]: enhances the experience at all, whether that's like watching
[00:32:17.230] [SPEAKER_04]: clips on TikTok and reading comments or like, how engaged are you with the community?
[00:32:23.630] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I definitely look up Reddit threads after.
[00:32:27.810] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. And I'm like so deep into like what other people are theorizing.
[00:32:32.350] [SPEAKER_02]: I think it's helpful to because sometimes it's like
[00:32:34.870] [SPEAKER_02]: Korean Americans who are watching.
[00:32:36.410] [SPEAKER_02]: So they'll be like, oh, yeah, I read this on like the Korean forums
[00:32:39.450] [SPEAKER_02]: and they're sharing it with like, you know, us, us non-Koreans.
[00:32:43.550] [SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is valuable information.
[00:32:46.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, that's so true.
[00:32:48.030] [SPEAKER_03]: I get like I get deep in there, especially if I'm really like invested
[00:32:52.110] [SPEAKER_03]: in some drama, the Hottie Man Ricky stuff.
[00:32:55.870] [SPEAKER_03]: I was like in there, so like, dude, this girl's like anti-vaxxer.
[00:33:02.570] [SPEAKER_03]: I found out so much information is so bad, but like
[00:33:06.190] [SPEAKER_03]: it's both like Reddit threads stalking Instagrams.
[00:33:09.810] [SPEAKER_03]: I so bad, but like they're just out there.
[00:33:12.150] [SPEAKER_03]: So you find them.
[00:33:12.910] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, they have this picture at like the same location.
[00:33:16.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, are they together after the show?
[00:33:20.090] [SPEAKER_02]: I yeah. Yeah.
[00:33:21.730] [SPEAKER_02]: I think there's definitely some interest of like,
[00:33:24.450] [SPEAKER_02]: oh, are they together after the show?
[00:33:26.210] [SPEAKER_02]: I remember after season one of Singles Inferno,
[00:33:29.370] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, this guy was obsessed with this girl.
[00:33:32.150] [SPEAKER_02]: There's like no way that it was all fake. Right.
[00:33:35.590] [SPEAKER_02]: So I tried to look it up and see, are they still dating?
[00:33:39.530] [SPEAKER_02]: Are they like still hanging out?
[00:33:41.290] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's definitely a really big element that makes it so fun
[00:33:45.830] [SPEAKER_04]: because other people are just as if not more parasocial than you.
[00:33:51.010] [SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's always people like sleuthing and pulling
[00:33:53.330] [SPEAKER_04]: like screenshots and like compiling the teeth.
[00:33:56.550] [SPEAKER_04]: Like those are my favorite ones, like the summary posts.
[00:34:00.130] [SPEAKER_04]: But I like recently had a little bit of like a learning moment
[00:34:04.930] [SPEAKER_04]: because like I mentioned, I loved my sibling romance.
[00:34:08.510] [SPEAKER_04]: So I was fucking obsessed with that shit.
[00:34:11.290] [SPEAKER_04]: But I think I ruined the experience by like reading the forums and stuff
[00:34:15.870] [SPEAKER_04]: because going back to like the whole of someone is obviously there
[00:34:20.530] [SPEAKER_04]: to be like an influencer, it kind of ruins the experience for me.
[00:34:24.350] [SPEAKER_04]: I think fairly early on in the episodes,
[00:34:27.570] [SPEAKER_04]: people were already talking about like, oh, this guy has like a track record
[00:34:31.170] [SPEAKER_04]: of trying to become famous.
[00:34:33.250] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I was kind of like, if I didn't read that,
[00:34:36.170] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I would be having a better viewing experience.
[00:34:38.850] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that sucks.
[00:34:41.390] [SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw for exchange, there were some theories floating around like,
[00:34:46.610] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my God, like this couple used to be in the entertainment industry.
[00:34:50.170] [SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like one of them wanted to get on the show
[00:34:53.190] [SPEAKER_02]: to like have a second chance at entertainment.
[00:34:56.810] [SPEAKER_02]: And then that puts a whole new lens on how you're watching the show.
[00:35:00.810] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. And sometimes there's like leaks too,
[00:35:04.510] [SPEAKER_02]: which is like very interesting.
[00:35:06.050] [SPEAKER_02]: Now you're watching the show in anticipation of like that leak
[00:35:10.590] [SPEAKER_02]: popping up or something of that sort.
[00:35:13.070] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's still like very engaging to just like
[00:35:17.030] [SPEAKER_02]: find a community of other people who are like just as invested
[00:35:21.010] [SPEAKER_02]: as you are and discussing, like, oh my God, that was crazy
[00:35:23.950] [SPEAKER_02]: when this happened in the episode, right?
[00:35:26.310] [SPEAKER_03]: For me, that's my friend Jen will like immediately talk to each other
[00:35:30.310] [SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, did you watch this episode?
[00:35:31.770] [SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll send her all the Reddit links and like, it's really
[00:35:35.410] [SPEAKER_03]: we corroborate information, collaborate.
[00:35:39.810] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, also, like some of these people online are so good
[00:35:44.170] [SPEAKER_02]: at finding information in exchange.
[00:35:47.170] [SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the people was an ex-idol.
[00:35:50.610] [SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's just like breadcrumbs of information
[00:35:53.070] [SPEAKER_02]: that's being revealed in the show.
[00:35:55.350] [SPEAKER_02]: It was mentioned that they were in like a company to train
[00:35:59.390] [SPEAKER_02]: and then they ended up switching companies to debut.
[00:36:02.950] [SPEAKER_02]: And people like found old videos of them at that like first company.
[00:36:09.250] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, my God, they were like actually a whatever trainee.
[00:36:13.590] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was like, where are you like uncovering these ancient videos from?
[00:36:18.510] [SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy, too, because so I'll like read the Korean forums as well as Reddit.
[00:36:24.030] [SPEAKER_04]: So as you can imagine, I'm like really deep into like all the fucking goss,
[00:36:29.030] [SPEAKER_04]: which is kind of time consuming, actually.
[00:36:30.410] [SPEAKER_04]: But what I find interesting is it's really common for like people to post
[00:36:35.970] [SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, I'm like so and so's high school friend.
[00:36:38.330] [SPEAKER_04]: And like, here's all the stuff that I remember.
[00:36:40.730] [SPEAKER_04]: And they'll post like yearbook photos and stuff.
[00:36:43.650] [SPEAKER_04]: And the crazy thing, too, is coworkers will do that as well.
[00:36:47.630] [SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know why, but in Korea, like
[00:36:51.330] [SPEAKER_04]: oftentimes reality TV is discussed on blind,
[00:36:55.570] [SPEAKER_04]: which in the US we use as like a company forum, right?
[00:36:59.850] [SPEAKER_04]: Like you have like people talking about compensation and company culture.
[00:37:04.410] [SPEAKER_04]: But in Korea, they have like forums on blind where you can talk about shows
[00:37:09.250] [SPEAKER_04]: and entertainment and posts instead of like the commenters username.
[00:37:13.690] [SPEAKER_04]: It'll also show like, oh, this person is verified to be working at Samsung
[00:37:17.510] [SPEAKER_04]: or like this person is verified to be working at this company.
[00:37:20.270] [SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually see that they are coworkers with whoever is being talked about.
[00:37:26.370] [SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like a very fascinating forum culture.
[00:37:29.830] [SPEAKER_04]: And I'll like always run to check that to see if there's any like juicy gossip.
[00:37:34.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[00:37:34.990] [SPEAKER_03]: Interesting. But it makes sense because there's like a level of verification
[00:37:38.210] [SPEAKER_03]: that you can get from blind plus like anonymity.
[00:37:42.490] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we should start using blind like that.
[00:37:45.330] [SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we're getting just random Reddit users being like,
[00:37:48.250] [SPEAKER_02]: actually, I knew this celebrity in high school.
[00:37:52.590] [SPEAKER_03]: There's something it's very similar to blind called fishbowl.
[00:37:55.950] [SPEAKER_03]: That a lot of consultants would use.
[00:37:58.670] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there were a lot of bulls or like threads for like
[00:38:01.990] [SPEAKER_03]: non work related gossip or things.
[00:38:06.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:38:08.470] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a good use case, actually.
[00:38:12.090] [SPEAKER_02]: I never even thought that would be possible.
[00:38:13.910] [SPEAKER_02]: But now that you've like set it into existence, I'm like,
[00:38:17.130] [SPEAKER_02]: oh, that makes so much sense.
[00:38:20.590] [SPEAKER_04]: OK, but I do have a question for you guys.
[00:38:23.530] [SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the most fun parts of watching reality TV
[00:38:26.410] [SPEAKER_04]: is watching it with other people, because not only can you like
[00:38:29.750] [SPEAKER_04]: talk about it and like sound board off your opinions with them,
[00:38:33.230] [SPEAKER_04]: you also start to see people are so different.
[00:38:36.150] [SPEAKER_04]: Because for me, the archetype of character that I always love
[00:38:40.850] [SPEAKER_04]: is like the scorned woman.
[00:38:42.550] [SPEAKER_04]: She had this like undying love for this guy
[00:38:45.290] [SPEAKER_04]: who turned out to be an asshole, but she like stuck it out
[00:38:48.830] [SPEAKER_04]: through the end anyway.
[00:38:50.070] [SPEAKER_04]: And I love her because she's stuck to her gun.
[00:38:52.150] [SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's me.
[00:38:53.750] [SPEAKER_04]: But my husband, he likes like the Chad character,
[00:38:57.950] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, like the guy who never had like a losing moment
[00:39:01.130] [SPEAKER_04]: or like a weak moment.
[00:39:02.370] [SPEAKER_04]: He was just a Chad from day one all the way to the end.
[00:39:06.870] [SPEAKER_04]: So for you guys, what character do you think ends up being your favorite
[00:39:10.670] [SPEAKER_04]: on these shows?
[00:39:12.030] [SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's people who have good emotional intelligence
[00:39:15.410] [SPEAKER_03]: from watching this show.
[00:39:17.630] [SPEAKER_03]: So like their interactions with the people in their room,
[00:39:20.630] [SPEAKER_03]: they're always kind of the person giving like solid advice
[00:39:24.090] [SPEAKER_03]: or like how they turn people down or how they like express their feelings.
[00:39:28.370] [SPEAKER_03]: It just feels very mature.
[00:39:31.470] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I can agree with that, too.
[00:39:34.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Like having good emotional intelligence,
[00:39:37.330] [SPEAKER_02]: having like confidence and like sureness in themselves
[00:39:41.610] [SPEAKER_02]: so that they're not too wishy washy.
[00:39:45.050] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I went after this person.
[00:39:46.270] [SPEAKER_02]: They rejected me.
[00:39:47.110] [SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to go after this next person like, dude,
[00:39:50.630] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if they're just like they hold themselves in a confident manner,
[00:39:54.970] [SPEAKER_02]: if they show kind of weakness in the show,
[00:39:57.450] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hate them, but I'm going to be like,
[00:39:59.510] [SPEAKER_02]: oh, that's like too bad.
[00:40:00.670] [SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel a bit bad, but they're not going to be my favorite character.
[00:40:04.850] [SPEAKER_03]: Insecurity, huge it.
[00:40:09.450] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like there was this girl in exchange
[00:40:12.390] [SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like she was young,
[00:40:15.410] [SPEAKER_02]: but she showed a lot of emotional intelligence or like maturity.
[00:40:18.970] [SPEAKER_02]: If someone wanted to hang out with her or like go on a date with her,
[00:40:23.310] [SPEAKER_02]: but she was not interested in them.
[00:40:25.050] [SPEAKER_02]: She was just like, no, like I am not really that interested in you.
[00:40:29.830] [SPEAKER_02]: And she would like call them out if they mistreated her or something.
[00:40:33.770] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, that's like that's cool.
[00:40:36.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's really respectable.
[00:40:38.630] [SPEAKER_02]: And she liked one person on the show and she just like stuck to it.
[00:40:43.050] [SPEAKER_02]: At least as far as I watched.
[00:40:45.330] [SPEAKER_02]: I won't say anything.
[00:40:50.510] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like those are definitely some important elements.
[00:40:54.330] [SPEAKER_04]: I think I also kind of like people who are very polite slash
[00:40:59.650] [SPEAKER_04]: there's a phrase in Korean called ttikopta,
[00:41:02.670] [SPEAKER_04]: which basically means you're being like rude or kind of like a bitch sometimes.
[00:41:06.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't like characters like that.
[00:41:08.230] [SPEAKER_04]: I like people who are polite and if they have emotions,
[00:41:11.390] [SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't become their like entire attitude for the day.
[00:41:14.050] [SPEAKER_04]: They are able to slot it away and like process it by themselves
[00:41:16.710] [SPEAKER_04]: without inflicting it onto others.
[00:41:18.850] [SPEAKER_04]: So then I like to seek those people out.
[00:41:22.010] [SPEAKER_04]: But it is interesting, too, because sometimes at the beginning,
[00:41:24.410] [SPEAKER_04]: someone is portrayed a certain way.
[00:41:26.510] [SPEAKER_04]: And then by the end, you're like, oh, like you're not who I thought you were.
[00:41:30.230] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you put them in an interesting situation and their reaction is so like jarring.
[00:41:35.210] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, wow, they're they're actually like so bothered
[00:41:39.790] [SPEAKER_03]: or like like they really like went and did that.
[00:41:44.250] [SPEAKER_03]: Like singles in for now, you know, that guy who got rejected like four times
[00:41:47.830] [SPEAKER_03]: and then he looked like, do you know who I'm talking about?
[00:41:50.870] [SPEAKER_03]: And his eyes were like,
[00:41:53.230] oh, you want to?
[00:41:55.910] [SPEAKER_03]: He was like, he was like over in the corner, just like,
[00:41:59.810] [SPEAKER_03]: like, I can't believe she rejected me.
[00:42:02.890] [SPEAKER_03]: Like that was him.
[00:42:06.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's so funny.
[00:42:07.930] [SPEAKER_02]: I must admit, it sounds like we like the level headed people.
[00:42:11.990] [SPEAKER_02]: But for a good reality TV,
[00:42:14.870] [SPEAKER_02]: you need those people who will really react and stir up trouble.
[00:42:20.210] [SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's like when someone is level headed among drama stirs,
[00:42:25.030] [SPEAKER_02]: then it's like a really attractive quality.
[00:42:28.050] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[00:42:29.490] [SPEAKER_03]: They shine because there's drama.
[00:42:31.970] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:34.090] [SPEAKER_02]: I will give the drama creators props like they're probably the real MVPs.
[00:42:40.230] [SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like you could also be a drama stir,
[00:42:43.870] [SPEAKER_04]: but still get a good edit if you have good interviews.
[00:42:47.090] [SPEAKER_04]: So on your like interviews,
[00:42:48.290] [SPEAKER_04]: if you're able to explain your thought process in like a very clear way,
[00:42:52.890] [SPEAKER_04]: it's hard not to sympathize with someone,
[00:42:54.650] [SPEAKER_04]: even if they were being emotional in the moment.
[00:42:56.430] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, I can totally follow their logic
[00:42:58.010] [SPEAKER_04]: because they felt this because of that and blah, blah.
[00:43:00.870] [SPEAKER_04]: So I think oftentimes like even in exchange to some of the more
[00:43:04.970] [SPEAKER_04]: dramatic people, like I still sympathize with them because I was like, yeah,
[00:43:09.290] [SPEAKER_04]: I get it. Like, it's like a shitty situation.
[00:43:12.710] [SPEAKER_04]: And I follow along with what you're saying.
[00:43:15.270] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have a question for you all.
[00:43:17.990] [SPEAKER_02]: If you could participate in one of the Korean reality TV shows,
[00:43:22.410] [SPEAKER_02]: which one would you participate in?
[00:43:26.130] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I would qualify for physical 100 or singles
[00:43:29.330] [SPEAKER_03]: inferno or love after divorce yet.
[00:43:34.170] [SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like I feel like something like Heart Signal
[00:43:38.230] [SPEAKER_03]: would be the most reasonable.
[00:43:40.030] [SPEAKER_03]: And that's like a nice wholesome one.
[00:43:43.530] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like I would want to do My Sibling Romance,
[00:43:47.050] [SPEAKER_04]: but I'm an only child, unfortunately, so I wouldn't qualify.
[00:43:51.950] [SPEAKER_04]: But like, I want to do a show where you go on with someone
[00:43:55.490] [SPEAKER_04]: because then I feel like it would be less scary.
[00:43:57.770] [SPEAKER_04]: Like you have someone you at least know, right?
[00:44:00.310] [SPEAKER_03]: I would love My Sibling Romance actually.
[00:44:03.330] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my brother's not single.
[00:44:04.750] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I was actually thinking that too.
[00:44:07.030] [SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I think if I went on My Sibling Romance, it would be hella funny.
[00:44:11.690] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't think my brother would care at all about like
[00:44:15.450] [SPEAKER_02]: who I'm trying to date or something.
[00:44:17.470] [SPEAKER_02]: I think if anything, he would just be like,
[00:44:19.430] [SPEAKER_02]: wow, these guys in this house are really funny.
[00:44:21.830] [SPEAKER_02]: Go for it, I guess.
[00:44:23.330] Like, you know,
[00:44:24.710] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Loki, I would care a lot, though,
[00:44:28.010] [SPEAKER_02]: about like who he's dating.
[00:44:30.050] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel the same.
[00:44:31.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Elliot has never cared who I dated.
[00:44:33.470] [SPEAKER_03]: He just kind of always.
[00:44:35.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure. Like he seems nice.
[00:44:38.010] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same.
[00:44:40.090] [SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys need to watch it?
[00:44:41.250] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like very interesting.
[00:44:42.870] [SPEAKER_04]: I think unavoidably, since the show features two people from like the same family,
[00:44:48.250] [SPEAKER_04]: they kind of talk about their like family history and stuff.
[00:44:51.390] [SPEAKER_04]: So some of the families will be like divorced parents or,
[00:44:54.890] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, some of the families will be like super well off
[00:44:57.570] [SPEAKER_04]: and like clearly a happy family and whatnot.
[00:44:59.870] [SPEAKER_04]: So they'll dive into their family stories a little bit.
[00:45:02.270] [SPEAKER_04]: But what's crazy and what that opens the door to is like hate comments.
[00:45:08.250] [SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't avoid hate comments, right?
[00:45:10.190] [SPEAKER_04]: But on a regular reality TV show, the hate comment might be like,
[00:45:13.670] [SPEAKER_04]: oh, this person is being a bitch or this person is such an asshole,
[00:45:18.110] [SPEAKER_04]: like blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:18.950] [SPEAKER_04]: But what the family stories enable the hate comments to be is like,
[00:45:22.810] [SPEAKER_04]: oh, this person is a bitch because they come from this kind of family
[00:45:25.830] [SPEAKER_04]: or like this person clearly has unresolved trauma because his parents are blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:30.650] [SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like so insane and like, I think,
[00:45:34.970] [SPEAKER_04]: triply hurtful because you're dragging in like parents
[00:45:39.170] [SPEAKER_04]: and their parenting skills and stuff like that.
[00:45:42.290] [SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like it is a double edged sword.
[00:45:44.150] [SPEAKER_04]: Like it is a very wholesome show and like heartwarming to a lot of people.
[00:45:48.130] [SPEAKER_04]: But then the haters just have more ammo and like fuel.
[00:45:51.510] [SPEAKER_03]: That's so fair.
[00:45:52.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not stuff you can change too.
[00:45:54.890] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[00:45:56.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Going back to how we only see so much of what's happening actually,
[00:46:00.470] [SPEAKER_03]: but can form such strong opinions about it.
[00:46:03.390] [SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not healthy for anyone involved.
[00:46:07.190] [SPEAKER_02]: The editors have so much power of like, yeah, you know, the public's perception of you.
[00:46:12.770] [SPEAKER_03]: And it's like incentivized for them to create characters out of you.
[00:46:18.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[00:46:18.490] [SPEAKER_03]: So like if you're going to be the person that gets hated,
[00:46:20.990] [SPEAKER_03]: like they're going to make you look real bad.
[00:46:22.950] [SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[00:46:23.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:46:23.670] [SPEAKER_02]: True.
[00:46:24.770] [SPEAKER_02]: What do you think your personal character would be on a reality show?
[00:46:29.710] [SPEAKER_03]: Ideally the type of person I like to watch, but I have no idea.
[00:46:33.530] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I feel like Anne would maybe be like the aloof person.
[00:46:39.670] [SPEAKER_02]: Like the really funny-
[00:46:40.870] [SPEAKER_02]: Should I give you aloof?
[00:46:42.870] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you would be like the comedy relief, like the really funny person.
[00:46:50.390] [SPEAKER_02]: Let me revert this.
[00:46:51.750] [SPEAKER_02]: She looks insulted.
[00:46:53.470] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to find love on this show, Crystal.
[00:46:56.990] [SPEAKER_02]: I think you would be like the lovable comic relief.
[00:47:01.130] [SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, oh my God, she's so funny.
[00:47:04.030] [SPEAKER_02]: Like the honest character?
[00:47:06.690] [SPEAKER_03]: I do feel like I'm not like competitive when it comes to romance.
[00:47:10.830] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if I were to be on the show, I'd be myself,
[00:47:13.230] [SPEAKER_03]: try to be friends with everyone and like, you know, come away, you know.
[00:47:16.910] [SPEAKER_03]: But if a girl I like liked someone and I was interested in them,
[00:47:19.850] [SPEAKER_03]: I would just like let that happen.
[00:47:21.870] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[00:47:22.910] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's a pretty good character.
[00:47:24.390] [SPEAKER_02]: People would probably love that.
[00:47:25.750] [SPEAKER_02]: They would be like, oh my God, I feel so sorry for Anne.
[00:47:28.490] [SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm rooting for her.
[00:47:33.010] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, pity points is crazy.
[00:47:36.170] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:47:36.290] [SPEAKER_03]: Pity points go so hard though.
[00:47:38.550] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:47:39.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Like post-show success.
[00:47:41.430] [SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[00:47:42.090] [SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[00:47:43.510] [SPEAKER_02]: It would be positive pity points.
[00:47:45.810] [SPEAKER_02]: It would be like, I love Anne so much.
[00:47:47.930] [SPEAKER_02]: I just want her to succeed, but she's letting other people succeed.
[00:47:53.870] [SPEAKER_03]: So funny.
[00:47:56.510] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I feel like I could low key see myself being like a shitster.
[00:48:00.450] [SPEAKER_04]: I think it could go either way.
[00:48:01.650] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I think I would either be like the girl that couples up kind of early
[00:48:05.010] [SPEAKER_04]: and then you know those people who just like fizzle out of the show
[00:48:08.190] [SPEAKER_04]: because they're like in a couple.
[00:48:09.330] [SPEAKER_04]: I would be either that or like a shitster, I think.
[00:48:13.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could totally see that.
[00:48:14.910] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I don't think I would make good reality TV.
[00:48:18.030] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I would just be so like non-reactive sometimes maybe.
[00:48:22.870] [SPEAKER_03]: No, that's funny too in its own way.
[00:48:24.930] [SPEAKER_03]: True.
[00:48:25.090] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I would love a character like you.
[00:48:27.610] [SPEAKER_03]: You know when there's like those edits just like zooming into someone's face
[00:48:31.950] [SPEAKER_03]: and they're like not, do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:48:34.390] [SPEAKER_03]: They're like thinking about something else.
[00:48:37.930] [SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't know if you're the type of person to like zone out like that,
[00:48:41.450] [SPEAKER_03]: but that's where I would peg you.
[00:48:45.270] [SPEAKER_03]: The disassociating person.
[00:48:47.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, looking at you like, ah this conversation is stupid.
[00:48:52.010] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like where's the alcohol?
[00:48:53.850] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:48:55.550] [SPEAKER_03]: Gets up and goes to the kitchen.
[00:48:59.410] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think this question is very interesting because
[00:49:02.310] [SPEAKER_04]: sometimes contestants talk about how like,
[00:49:05.410] [SPEAKER_04]: like I never thought I would be this kind of character,
[00:49:07.210] [SPEAKER_04]: but on the show like things are so high stakes that were like so emotional or something.
[00:49:12.590] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm always like, how bad could it be?
[00:49:15.490] [SPEAKER_04]: But also I feel like my emotions fluctuate,
[00:49:17.910] [SPEAKER_04]: so maybe I could see it getting really bad on the show,
[00:49:20.890] [SPEAKER_04]: but it's like one of those things where you never know.
[00:49:23.370] [SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe you as a solo person wouldn't get too involved,
[00:49:27.850] [SPEAKER_02]: but because maybe you like befriended one of the other girls,
[00:49:31.610] [SPEAKER_02]: now you're like dragged into the drama too and you're like oh my god, like super invested.
[00:49:36.710] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah or it's like, you know in your real life you have like hobbies and stuff,
[00:49:40.970] [SPEAKER_04]: so then you're like oh you know like I'm not gonna stress about this,
[00:49:43.730] [SPEAKER_04]: I'll just go work out or something.
[00:49:45.030] [SPEAKER_04]: But on the show you're like confined inside this house
[00:49:47.570] [SPEAKER_04]: and there's nothing to do except goss and fight.
[00:49:50.510] [SPEAKER_04]: So then maybe you're like okay I'm bored, like fuck it.
[00:49:55.230] [SPEAKER_04]: At least this is stimulating.
[00:49:56.410] [SPEAKER_02]: Time to stir the pot.
[00:50:00.290] [SPEAKER_04]: Well this has been fun.
[00:50:02.530] [SPEAKER_04]: I think diving deep on reality TV which is like one of my main personality traits slash hobbies.
[00:50:09.250] [SPEAKER_04]: It was always interesting to sit down and talk about reality TV
[00:50:12.130] [SPEAKER_04]: because I think even with the same show we can all have such differing perspectives on it.
[00:50:17.630] [SPEAKER_04]: So thank you Anne for joining us today to talk about Korean reality TV.
