[00:00:00.320] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Taneah. Welcome back, Taneah. The last time you were on the podcast was episode 207, Internships and Intern Season, which was pretty fun.
[00:00:25.070] We reflected on what it was like to be interns now that we're, I guess, seasoned full-time employees. But being an intern, I feel like is a pretty special time. But today we have a pretty fun topic, I think, to talk about, which is the
[00:00:42.710] concept of fangirling or being obsessed with some sort of celebrity. I think we've all had phases or times where we've been super into a celebrity or like a group of celebrities. We thought it would be fun to just talk a little bit about the why behind it for
[00:01:02.070] ourselves, as well as, I guess, just gushing about our obsessions for a little bit. Yeah, this episode is actually an excuse for us to talk about our obsessions and just obsess over them even further.
[00:01:14.510] But to kind of kick this episode off, I do want to ask both of you what draws you to someone famous? Like, what do you think pulls you in in that initial obsession period? I think usually my obsessions start with either they're a singer or an
[00:01:30.670] actor. And it's just their charm during interviews, the way that they talk to the reporter or whatever. I think that's what initially draws me in. The reason I say it's not because of their character that they play is because
[00:01:43.590] recently I'm watching House of the Dragon and I'm obsessed with the actor that plays Egon. Oh, yeah. He's crazy in House of the Dragon, obviously, but in real life, he's just so charming and he has a cute little accent. I'm like, oh my gosh, you are so adorable.
[00:02:02.870] So it's definitely the charm during interviews that gets me. Yeah, I think I'm similar to you where it's not necessarily like the character that someone plays that initially draws me in. I think it is what's behind that, like the person behind that.
[00:02:20.270] I think for me, it's like skill usually is like the first thing. So if I think someone is a really good singer, that's something that initially draws me in. And then, you know, I start watching more of their performances or maybe if
[00:02:34.390] it's an actor who I think is really good at acting, I'll want to watch more of their shows or movies. And then from there, it just exponentially snowballs and grows. And then I'm like, wait, why do I know so much about this person?
[00:02:50.390] I think for me, I actually do really care about the character that's being played when it comes to being an actor. So I think I've talked about this on this podcast before, but I had a huge succession phase maybe like a year or so ago now.
[00:03:05.350] And I just fell into this huge rabbit hole with the guy who plays Kendall Roy, Jeremy Strong. I knew for some reason you were going to say Kendall out of all the people. I don't know why.
[00:03:18.950] OK, I feel like that character in particular, like breeds fangirling and obsession because it's like such an imperfect character. He, at many points of the show, is one of the main characters and like, you know, is really like feeling the narrative.
[00:03:34.550] And I don't know, I just find him like so attractive. But I think from my obsession was so strong. And if I think about my past obsessions as well, I had a huge like top from Big Bang phase and I was definitely also drawn in from the looks.
[00:03:51.830] So I think I'm just a very visual learner. Wait, Taneh, have you seen Succession? Yeah, I have. I'm like laughing on the side because I'm like, oh, Kendall, what the heck? If you were to be obsessed with someone from Succession, who do you think it would be?
[00:04:12.990] Yeah, I was I was also thinking about that. And then it kind of made sense in my head because out of all the characters, I feel like I would also be obsessed with Kendall. So Jisoo, I get it. Fine. Justice for Jisoo has been delivered.
[00:04:27.630] I'm accepted in this world. I guess I can kind of make sense of it. So I haven't watched the last season of Succession yet, but I feel like Kendall is the guy who wants to succeed but is knocked down a lot.
[00:04:43.430] And maybe that cycle is something that makes you want to root for him. I'm not sure. I think that makes sense. And I guess also going back to the character being compelling part, I realize that I'm very into the character where they're like the underdog and they're
[00:04:59.390] like trying really hard, but things don't always work out perfectly for them. So I think that is also what makes me stay. I'm like, oh, is this person also an underdog in real life? Has this person played similar characters?
[00:05:12.430] And then I go through their whole history, I guess. Yeah. In terms of character, I'm more drawn to people who are like, not the bad guy, but like they're good, but they could be bad sort of vibe.
[00:05:26.470] For example, I recently watched the show The Gentleman on Netflix with Theo James, beautiful man, very cute. And he's like this nice, posh little English dude that gets dragged into the marijuana game in England. And I don't know, just something about the way he handles stress and pressure.
[00:05:47.310] I'm like, wow, you are so attractive right now. And even when I was watching Peaky Blinders, which is about basically a gang in Birmingham in the UK, I was obsessed with Thomas Shelby who's played by Cillian Murphy. Oh my gosh.
[00:06:01.950] I was like, your accent, the way again that you're handling all these other bad dudes is amazing. So I think that's the type of character I enjoy in Fanclub over. You like the cool, calm and collected guy. Yeah. But you're right. Thomas Shelby is a little morally gray.
[00:06:21.630] Yeah. And I think that's what makes everything so interesting, even as you're watching the show, aside from the actor itself that's playing it, morally gray characters just keep you on your toes and you're like, that's not okay, like what you just
[00:06:34.030] did, but I don't know, there's something about you that I'm like, it's okay. It's fine. Do whatever you want to do. I feel like in a way, things like that, where you're kind of questioning, are you really the good person or a bad person? That's what's compelling, right?
[00:06:48.070] Like that's, what's interesting and makes them a more real character versus someone who always plays some sort of shtick of like, oh, I'm always the good guy or I'm always the bad guy. And it's kind of with like Kendall as well, to be honest, to go back to
[00:06:59.990] succession where there are some points where you are rooting for him because he is trying to do the right thing. And then sometimes he just does something that's completely bizarre and you're like, why, why did you do that? You know?
[00:07:10.350] So I feel like, yeah, that's what makes a good character. Yeah. That makes sense. In terms of character, I think I'm drawn to usually like the main character or someone who has, yeah, I guess like you guys said, a compelling
[00:07:26.950] story or maybe like they're just very charming in the show. When I watch a show, I really like get sucked into the world and I'm like, I become the main character. I'm like thinking, wow, if that were me, you know, like what would I be doing?
[00:07:41.510] So I think it has to also have some sort of relatability. And I think that's where just like not always doing the right thing comes in play because you're like, oh yeah, I would probably like fuck this up too. Or like, I would make the mistake here.
[00:07:53.110] Like, I don't even know what the right choice is. And so I think like having that relatability is a big thing. And I think that's a big thing in terms of my personal obsession slash fangirling for people.
[00:08:05.230] I think when I can see like some traits of myself in someone who is like, you know, famous and accomplished, I'm like, whoa, that's really cool to see. That means that people like me could succeed in a world like that. Oh, that's really interesting actually.
[00:08:20.950] I never thought about it like that, but I think you're totally right. If I look at the interviews or like the real life personas of people who I've really obsessed over, I feel like all of them are like slightly awkward in
[00:08:32.310] a way. Like it's never the guy who's like winning over the host. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like someone who is maybe earnest and like funny, but not like the main character. And I feel like that's what makes them so much more real to me, too.
[00:08:44.030] So I think you do kind of seek out relatability points and people who aren't so like, I don't know, like super powerful. Yeah. I was going to say like someone who isn't as composed because even in
[00:08:57.630] interviews when they're like messing around, I feel like that's really fun to watch and also relatable because it's just like you're chatting with your friends. Like you're never like formal or anything like that. I get the idea of liking somebody because they're not always like polished.
[00:09:11.670] I feel like if they're too like PR perfect, it's just like clearly a, you know, creation of the Hollywood machine or, you know, something of that sort. There's like no mistakes and it's harder to relate to that for sure.
[00:09:25.230] True. I also feel like there's a little bit more fun when you're obsessing over someone who's not like an A-list star, because when a more niche star has like a movie launching, you get so it because it's like so far and few in between. True.
[00:09:41.430] But then you have to wait a long time. That is also true. And also if you want to like consume their content, you can't do it immediately. Yeah. It's kind of hard. Dude, that's why you need someone who's not up and coming, but has
[00:09:55.510] already arrived a little bit. Like even if they're more niche, you know, maybe not A-list, but hopefully they have at least like a show under their belt or like, you know, a couple of movies so you can spend some time consuming that content or if they're a
[00:10:14.390] singer, hopefully they have more than one album so that you don't have to just listen to one album on repeat. Do you ever fangirl over like singers in particular that don't necessarily have a media presence?
[00:10:26.990] Like do you fangirl over them through their voice or like how do you for singers, how do you usually like start the obsession? The singer that I was probably the most obsessed with was again, top from Big Bang slash Big Bang in general.
[00:10:41.550] So for them and I think for Korean idols, like you kind of have to be out there. You have to be on variety shows to get really famous. So I grew up with a lot of Big Bang content, like so much so that I can
[00:10:54.910] confidently say that I've maybe watched like less than half of what's really out there. Like I know some people who really follow idols watch like every fan cam and every performance. Like I'm definitely not at that level. So I always had like an abundance of stuff to watch.
[00:11:08.510] Similar for me, the singer that I was most obsessed with is a K-pop person. Her name is Taeyeon and she's from Girls' Gen. She's like solo now. But like when I started to like really get into her, the group Girls' Gen already
[00:11:23.270] ran like through their most popular time. So I was like, oh dude, there's like a gold mine of content here for me. Even though now as she's like solo, she has less content because she's like low key.
[00:11:36.070] I'm just trying to sit at home and like chill and just like release music. So I thought that was like lucky, I guess in a sense. Like, oh, I still have all this content while she doesn't have to like work as
[00:11:46.310] hard as when she was younger in terms of like public appearances. I still remember in college, you used to always give me rides home from like GBM or something. You'd be like, Taneya, have you heard of this singer? And then you would put on Taeyeon.
[00:12:01.150] It was just so cute because you were obsessed. Like you were like talking about all the things that she did, blah, blah, blah. And it was just so cute. But yeah, she was a very good singer. Yeah, I enjoyed it. It's kind of an interesting story.
[00:12:16.070] Like I took this K-pop class at school because I had to do like a music or art lower div and we learned about K-pop. And I was like, wow, I haven't listened to K-pop in so long.
[00:12:27.270] Last time was like middle school when some of my friends were really into it. Some of these songs were like bringing back memories. So I went home and I started deep diving into a bunch of like K-pop and like a bunch of like K-pop music videos.
[00:12:40.910] And as most people know, these music videos are like very, very eye-catching. It's like easy to get sucked in. They're like super colorful, super vibrant. And so as I fell down that rabbit hole, I like discovered Girls' Gen literally so
[00:12:55.870] late. And then I was like, wow, this one girl is like such a good singer in this group. And then that's like how the whole thing happened. So that's interesting to me because I feel like you almost had like a formal introduction into this obsession.
[00:13:08.790] But oftentimes I feel like we're introduced to so many celebrities, so many different actors, etc. But we're not obsessing over all of them, right? Even if they're talented or attractive. So what do you think it is about maybe a specific period in your life or like a
[00:13:23.870] specific mindset that you have that really helps you fall into that like fangirl obsession over someone? When I was in high school, I was really, really, really obsessed with One Direction. It was like kind of embarrassing, honestly.
[00:13:37.750] But one thing that kind of aided that or helped in that was they were on X Factor. So there was like a huge media presence and there were so many people that were already obsessed with them that it kind of like I would see it like everywhere.
[00:13:52.070] And that made me even more obsessed because, again, there was content with like formal content that their PR team is putting out, that they're doing interviews, etc. But then there are the fanfics. And there are all that those type of content that came out.
[00:14:07.870] And my friend and I in high school, we used to literally send each other fanfics about One Direction, specifically like I loved Harry and she loved Zayn. So we would individually each read fanfics about Harry or Zayn.
[00:14:23.950] And it was just such a like crazy world to be a part of because there's already all these super crazy fans that are producing like honestly really good stories. So it just helped in that session.
[00:14:36.550] Well, I totally feel that the first point you said for sure, like when this group or person is on the rise and they're just being like force fed to everyone through media, you know, we used to listen to radio a lot more and then people would just
[00:14:49.510] like spam their songs on radio. Chappelle Roan is like the biggest thing right now. So then just like spam her songs on radio or something like that. I think there might have been some point in high school where I would like change the
[00:15:00.150] station. Every single station is playing the One Direction song or something. And you know what's crazy is now when like every other station is like playing another big artist like Taylor Swift, I'm just like I need to shut off the radio.
[00:15:14.110] But back then when they were playing One Direction, I was like, keep it coming. Like don't stop. And now I get how people feel when they were hearing One Direction because they were probably like this is madness. But I loved it back then. It was great.
[00:15:27.350] I think also you're right, like fanfic has extremely powerful pull. It's like not spoken of as much, especially when we were in high school. But I think now people are truly starting to recognize the power of fanfic.
[00:15:45.790] And actually Jisoo and I were recently talking about how like Fifty Shades of Grey was originally like a Twilight fanfic, right? And we're like, dude, that was like the first time ever where it was like, you can do this like with fanfic. This has like that much power.
[00:16:00.110] It can become public and like a movie, like a franchise. I feel like we could even almost do a whole separate episode about fanfic, but I totally feel you on like fanfic really pulling you in and like keeping you there for a
[00:16:16.430] little bit because one, it's endless content and you can be as Delulu as you want because it's like fictional, right? You don't need images or like videos of it. Like it's all just like written out there.
[00:16:26.510] For me, Big Bang was definitely on the rise in like middle school, but they didn't have that many fanfics. So then what I would do is I would read Dongbangshinki fanfics and this was like the boy group that came out before Big Bang.
[00:16:40.150] So there was already like a huge catalog. So I would like sometimes read all the Big Bang ones. I'm like, oh shit, there's not that many left. So then I would read the Dongbangshinki ones and then like just imagine that they were the Outspach of the Big Bang.
[00:17:00.310] Just out of like sheer desperation, you know? But it's so interesting thinking back because that was like the first time I learned what like a TXT file was because back then, like Korean fanfics, they were all TXT file.
[00:17:14.470] And then I would push it in my tiny little MP3 and like read it on my own. Oh my god. So, you know, you're learning a lot of stuff from fanfics back in the day. That was like a true technology lesson too. Oh my god.
[00:17:29.710] No, Jisoo, I feel that though. Like it was so nice because it made the person that you're obsessed with so real in like the most bizarre way. Like as you said, you can be as Doolooloo as you want.
[00:17:39.150] So like in these like Harry Styles fanfics, he's like the sweetest, most charismatic guy, blah, blah, blah. You know, and it was just so fun to fantasize about that. And also I learned because I know we were talking about Fifty Shades of Grey.
[00:17:54.270] I learned that there's this book series called After... Oh my god, I know the series. Yeah, I forgot what it's called. You're right. I think the first one is like After and then the second one is like... After We Fall or something. Yeah, something like that.
[00:18:08.790] That started out as a fanfic based on Harry Styles. Oh. And I didn't know that. And so when I found out, I was like, oh my gosh, do I relive my obsession with Harry Styles? Wait, don't watch the movies.
[00:18:22.310] I actually did start watching the movies and it was god awful. So I didn't finish. So the only reason I know this, the movies, because usually these are like, you know, cute rom-com-ish stories. One of our friends, she's a sucker for those kinds of movies.
[00:18:38.590] And so we saw the trailer for it and she's like, oh my god, that looks enticing. Like let's go watch it. So we went and watched the movie and we're like, oh, like this movie probably did not quite portray...
[00:18:51.310] Like we learned to where like, oh, it's originally a fanfic. OK, like this movie might not have portrayed what the original fanfic was doing. But yeah, I think there's so many movies out there now that are like sometimes I watch
[00:19:03.270] the trailer and I'm like, oh, this looks like it might have been a fanfic. Yeah. And it's like you can also, I don't know, it's a specific genre of movies where it's like the acting isn't quite there. And it's just like something about the way it's filmed.
[00:19:17.790] You know that this started out as a fanfic, like something is off. I don't know. I guess the ultimate fanfic dream is like, imagine you wrote a fanfic for your celebrity crush and you were able to cast that person eventually in your movie.
[00:19:31.910] Like that would be crazy, right? That would be amazing. That sounds like a job, like you're a screenwriter and you don't use their name at the beginning and then you just cast them when you're making the movie.
[00:19:46.430] Oh, my gosh, guys, there is this one episode of iCarly that came out where One Direction was on it. And I started, I started writing a fanfic as if I was like working on iCarly, like on the set. And I was like one of the background people.
[00:20:06.830] Oh, my God. Yeah. And then they like, Harry, like saw me and came up to me and started talking to me. And like while we were filming, we really hit it off. Like I didn't finish it, but like I was literally, I literally wrote it down.
[00:20:22.830] I don't know. I didn't like have a laptop or something then. So I wrote it down in my diary, like the fanfic in different chapters. It was insane. This is amazing. This is how writers are born. Yeah, maybe I should get it published.
[00:20:39.350] I also wrote a fanfic back in the day, actually. Me and my friend co-wrote like a Big Bang fanfic. Oh, my God. And we even published it too. And I don't think we got like a ton of traction or anything.
[00:20:50.670] But I remember like we were watching the view count go up and we were like, holy shit, this is crazy. You're like people are thirsty for the content. Yeah. And it was perfect because she liked G-Dragon and I liked T.O.P.
[00:21:04.710] So, you know, we didn't like have to fight for our mans. Like each had our own. Oh, my God. That's so funny. And I feel like sometimes reading fanfic, you're like, oh, like I could totally do this. We're just writing down a story that's in our head.
[00:21:19.390] But like sometimes the dedication these writers have is truly amazing. They're writing like novels in there. Yeah. And there used to be one writer that, again, had that Harry Styles fanfic. She used to come out with a new chapter every week or something.
[00:21:34.750] So my friend and I would like wait for the link. And like, you know, sometimes obviously her life got busy. So she didn't post. And I was just so sad when those chapters didn't come out. Like I was my lifeline was on those chapters.
[00:21:50.790] Dude, those are like webtoons basically. And I feel like really big fanfic writers are like many celebrities in the fandom. So don't judge me, please. But when I was really deep into like the succession obsession of it all, I would read, you know, the fanfics on Tumblr.
[00:22:11.790] And there's not a ton of people who write like Kendall Roy fanfics. But there's quite a lot actually, maybe like 10 or 15 at least. And they're really good people.
[00:22:20.390] They're like famous and people are like always in their ass like, oh, my God, can you please write, you know, a story about how Kendall does this or like Kendall is in this situation and blah blah.
[00:22:30.350] And they're like, okay, yeah, like, sorry, I didn't have that much time to write today. But here's like a 10,000 word like, you know, story responding to your ask. And I'm like, these people are busy. They're like booked and busy. You know, they need to be making money. Yeah.
[00:22:44.710] Wait, I did not know that they had fanfics like that today. For some reason, fanfics in my head live when I was in like high school, probably because that's when I was most obsessed with it. So I'm actually really surprised to hear about like Kendall Roy fanfics.
[00:23:01.070] That's crazy. Oh, my gosh. I think nowadays, okay, of course, One Direction fanfic is like legendary, right? There's like so much and it's like so dense. I think there's maybe not anything that has reached that kind of level of hugeness.
[00:23:18.830] But now it's just like more spread out among things. Some of the fanfic I do really like is related to shows because sometimes it's like, oh, the show didn't end. So, you know, someone writes up like what they think is going to happen next.
[00:23:31.510] And I feel like those are super enticing. But yeah, I think like there hasn't been as much of a like huge craze for I guess like fanfic of real people as there was during One Direction time. I could be wrong, but that's what it feels like.
[00:23:45.230] But you know what I see now? I see like fan edit videos. Oh, yeah. On YouTube or even like Instagram reels where it's just like maybe that's more around like shipping like two characters, not necessarily like fangirling over a certain character or actor.
[00:24:01.710] Actually, no, I see it for actors too. Like there's this one actor that I'm obsessed with. He's a Bollywood actor. His name is Aditya Roy Kapoor. Very, very, very attractive man.
[00:24:12.870] And on my Instagram reel, sometimes I'll see like edits of him like walking or like in interviews and I'm like obsessed. And my friends and I just send it to each other. What a beautiful man. So it still exists, I guess, just like in different forms.
[00:24:28.350] You know, back to the question of like, do you think you have to be in a specific like mindset to feel a really fangirl over someone?
[00:24:35.270] I feel like to like be super obsessed with someone, you need to have the time because as we're talking about this, I'm like, oh, yeah, there's so much content.
[00:24:43.590] Honestly, if someone's a celebrity or has like some level of fame, there's usually a pile of content that you know they're in, whether it's like movies, interviews, etc., etc.
[00:24:54.550] So I feel like one of the things is you have the time or maybe you're making the time like it's it's the distraction for you from like real life. True. You have to be able to like absorb the content.
[00:25:08.630] Yeah. And I also think like even, for example, like reading the fanfics, I mean, I guess it could be like an alternate to reading a book because it's just like a story.
[00:25:18.150] I think I needed to just like be in the mindset of having the time to obsess over somebody because then I would like go into a deep dive and like literally watch every single video, every single interview or like, yeah, it's a full time job.
[00:25:32.710] Yeah, it really is like you truly do become obsessed. Like everything that you're thinking about is like, oh, what's the next show or like fanfic or like interview that I can watch?
[00:25:42.750] And I feel like it also becomes so all consuming because like you said, you're constantly thinking about it. So then I feel like even in conversations, I'm like, oh, my God, like this is so something. True. Do you think celebrities like know about all these fanfics?
[00:26:01.110] Yes. I think because of the One Direction thing, they were made aware like it got so big, like people would ask them an interview sometime. Oh, yeah, that's true. That's just so crazy. Like imagine you're just living your life and people are writing stories about you. Crazy stories.
[00:26:20.110] That's true. Some some of them do get kind of crazy. Dude, so Jeremy Strong's first acting thing after Succession ended was like this Broadway show. Right. And that came out when I was like peak obsession. So I bought tickets to his opening night of previews.
[00:26:37.070] James and I went to go watch him. And James is very like made it very clear that he did not want to be there. But I was like, OK, I need like moral support.
[00:26:44.910] You know, I even thought about like bringing my GQ magazine to like get it signed by him because usually like the Broadway actors will come out and like sign stuff. I totally forgot. But regardless, we like made it there to opening night.
[00:26:57.150] And I had just read so many fanfics, many of them like raunchy to I guess use like the term about this guy. And if I'm able to read this stuff, it means someone is out there writing it.
[00:27:10.350] Right. So when we were standing outside, like waiting for him to come out and like sign our shit, just looking around the crowd. Like, are you the one who wrote this fanfic? You know, like I was just like what was going through my head.
[00:27:21.670] Like, are you the fanfic writer that wrote this story? Oh my god. I'm so curious about those fanfics actually, because I just I just can't get around somebody writing a fanfic about Kendall Roy. I just, that's just really cracking me up. Jisoo, you should link me.
[00:27:43.190] I want to read them. Oh my god, maybe I will. I have some bangers. I mean, to be fair, I feel like the Internet is so expansive. So if it exists and it's like published, I feel like there's like a fanfic for it. You know?
[00:27:57.510] That's true. We have someone right here among us who is a big Kendall Roy fan. So there must be many more out there. It's like semi embarrassing. I feel like also, though, like it's fun to be obsessed during the peak of something.
[00:28:15.830] So, you know, for like you and Kendall Roy, it was like the peak time of succession. And I feel like that's such a good time just because there's so much content being put out.
[00:28:26.110] Like you said, Tania, like when you started getting obsessed with One Direction, they were just like force feeding everyone their content. But you were like, oh, yeah, I love this. Yeah, I did not mind at all.
[00:28:37.670] Yeah. And I feel like that is probably such a good wave to ride because you're like, oh, my God, the content is never ending right now. But then when things start to like die down, it's like it's kind of depressing.
[00:28:49.350] You're like, oh, OK, I guess like I'll move on now. Oh, yeah, that's pretty sad if you put it like that, like moving on from your obsession. Yeah. Like you put it on hold. You're like, OK, I'll go do other things with my life. On to the next.
[00:29:09.110] Actually, yeah, my friend and I were talking about that the other day. She's like, I started reading the Harry Styles fanfic again because she just wanted to feel that like the way that she felt when she was reading those fanfics back in the day.
[00:29:23.510] The excitement of like having more content to consume. Yeah, that's actually kind of interesting to me, Tanaya, because I feel like multiple times throughout this episode you mentioned sending like fanfic links to each other or kind of like sharing your obsession with the people around you.
[00:29:41.030] So to you, do you think that's like a very integral part of what makes an obsession fun? I think so, because it's just like sharing that with somebody. For example, actually, back in high school, I used to be obsessed with British YouTubers, Zoella, Alfie, you know, that group.
[00:29:58.270] Yeah. And I used to kind of just like watch them on my own, you know, whatever, whenever I used to come back from school, just watch some YouTube.
[00:30:05.870] And then one time I was like sitting with my friend and I was just like, have you heard about this person named Zoella? And she's like, I love her videos. And I was like, oh, my God, this is so exciting.
[00:30:17.350] So both of us were like starting to like fangirl and like talk about these videos. So it just made it more like fun to share that experience with somebody also because you can go a little more diluted with somebody else, I will say.
[00:30:28.830] So it's just it's exciting to have somebody else to talk about it with. I don't think it's necessary, but I think it's just like it just makes it like an experience in my opinion. True. It's definitely an enhancement. You're like enabling each other.
[00:30:43.870] Yeah, I feel like when I'm obsessed with someone, I'm like quietly trying to insert them into the conversations or I'll quietly admit to like my closest friends like, oh, I'm really obsessed with this one person right now. So actually, right now I'm super obsessed with Kristen Stewart.
[00:30:59.750] And I've been telling Jisoo, I was like, dude, I don't know. I'm just like obsessed with her right now. Okay, linking it back to like what we've talked about. She's like more introverted and like quiet and like kind of shy and like a little bit awkward.
[00:31:16.390] And I'm like, dude, these are like qualities that I have. It's like it's very relatable. I think she's underrated. Like people hate on her for Twilight, but she's actually a great actress. So I've been binging her movies lately.
[00:31:29.790] It's so funny because I feel like we hung out a couple of times like over the last week. Just like one of the conversations each time we've hung out, like the destination is just Kristen Stewart. Yeah, it's so true. I don't know how to explain it.
[00:31:43.070] Like it's not like the whole time you're like dying to talk about her. I think just somewhere along the line, we just end up there. And I'm like, oh, we're here again. Dude, sometimes it's like masterful.
[00:31:55.870] I weave and then I'm like, oh my God, this is the perfect time. We can bring it home. Oh, actually, I have a really funny thing that I like about Kristen Stewart. She always has eye bags and I feel like I have eye bags.
[00:32:09.630] So I'm like, dude, that's like kind of cool that it's like imperfect, you know, like she always has eye bags. I was like, after I noticed that, I literally told you. So I was like, dude, how come like a lot of celebrities have like eye bags?
[00:32:22.630] And I was like, dude, I don't know. I guess I've never really noticed that about celebrities. Dude, that conversation was so funny now that I'm thinking about it because Crystal was like, dude, do you think I have eye bags?
[00:32:32.790] And I was like, oh no, I don't think you have eye bags. She's like, no, actually I do have eye bags and you know who else has eye bags? I was like, okay, I see. Yeah, that was one of my less smooth transitions.
[00:32:44.790] I was like, oh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, that was one of my less smooth transitions. Is that why you were looking into like Twilight fanfic and the Fifty Shades of Grey?
[00:33:00.950] Oh no, I just, that's innate knowledge. Kristen Stewart is a modern obsession for me. But I think Kristen Stewart is just a phase for me right now. Do you guys think you have like a biggest obsession or fangirl era? Maybe one that like transcends time.
[00:33:20.110] It'll go dormant, but I'll come back. I'll have to see how this like Kendall Roy thing plays out. Because, okay, the thing is, if there's not new content, which there isn't going to be of succession because the series has already ended,
[00:33:36.110] I feel like it's hard and I do really like Jeremy Strong, but it's different. Like, I feel like at the end of the day, it's like a Kendall Roy obsession. And I also like Jeremy Strong. Oh, I see. It's not the other way around.
[00:33:47.110] So we will see if this is a phase or not. I will always have a special place in my heart for Big Bang. Although Big Bang has also had its like fair share of problems recently. So you know what? I'm just not doing well.
[00:33:59.270] Like a year or two. I need something new to focus on. One Direction was definitely the biggest obsession that I had. But honestly, I don't see it coming back because A, the band is like done.
[00:34:12.270] But B, for some reason, I'm not as obsessed with like Harry Styles now. I was just obsessed with him back then. I have no idea why. I think it was also because like, I was younger and he was also like, you know, younger. Maybe it's that.
[00:34:27.270] But yeah, I don't know now. I'm just like, okay, I like your music. Like, I think it's good, but I'm not like watching every interview or like stalking his Instagram or anything like that. Like you kind of outgrew him. Yeah.
[00:34:39.270] And I think it's it's just kind of sad when you put it like that, but I feel like it's true. That's fair. I think maybe we also mellow out when we're older. Like we do have more responsibilities now and like things that take up our time.
[00:34:50.430] So we don't have as much free time as we once did in like, you know, high school, college, junior high, where we had much more time to like really become huge fans or like obsess over groups and or celebrities. I think my biggest obsession is probably Taeyeon.
[00:35:06.430] But it's kind of cool because like these people are getting older with us. So as she gets older, she's like more mellowed out. She's like, I don't want to be as busy and like do as many public appearances as before.
[00:35:21.590] And I think that helps, you know, like mellow everything else out too. It's like, oh, that's perfect. That fits for me too, because I don't have time to like dig through all your interviews and like, you know, binge watch these all for hours on end.
[00:35:33.590] I'm also an adult now and I have like other things to do, sadly. It's just so funny that you're talking about being an adult because Jisoo literally had her Kendall face as an adult.
[00:35:44.750] Like nobody has time to do this Jisoo on the side, like googling all these fanfics. I'm one of the 15 Tumblr fanfic writers. But do you feel like it's on the same level as it was when you were younger?
[00:36:00.750] I mean, I guess I don't have like Kendall Roy posters on the wall. Like my wall in my childhood room used to be like covered in like Big Bang posters and whatnot. So in some ways it's just different.
[00:36:12.910] And I also thought it was kind of funny because when I was younger, Big Bang was maybe like early 20s or something. And that was like peak hot to me, you know?
[00:36:21.910] And then I realized now that I'm older, I'm like fangirling over people who are like 40s, like mid 40s or something. And I was like, that's crazy. Like our obsessions also kind of grow older with us, right? Well, mine do.
[00:36:37.070] No, I think mine also because now like, for example, Theo James, I don't read any fanfics about him, but I do see a lot of edits and videos. And he's definitely older as well. I think it makes sense that your obsessions kind of mature as you grow older.
[00:36:52.070] It would be a little weird if we were like obsessed with somebody in high school. Oh, you're so right. I think like a lot of the newer generation of celebrities, I'm less invested in. I'm just like, oh, they feel young for some reason. Yeah.
[00:37:11.230] Although I do wonder if there's like a cap or like a certain point where they stay maybe at like the 50s or something like that. Because my mom used to really like Keanu Reeves and I saw something on Reddit recently.
[00:37:24.230] I was like, oh, Keanu Reeves is going to do like a Broadway show. And because I know how successful of a fan you can be when you go to a Broadway show. I was like, oh my god, mom, maybe we should go watch him together.
[00:37:34.390] Then we can get his signature after. She was like, well, I really liked Matrix Keanu Reeves, but I'm not trying to see Keanu at this age. Oh yeah.
[00:37:45.390] Or like, you know, the person that she really likes is like frozen in time and perfectly documented in like a movie. She's like, I don't really feel the need to go see him. He looks different now. He looks different now.
[00:37:57.550] So I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting. Yeah, that makes total sense that sometimes your obsession is just of like this particular period of time, like a character or person or whatever. I guess that's what happened to you Taneo with Harry Styles.
[00:38:11.550] Like now that we're out of that time period, you're kind of just like, okay, like I'm over it. It's so funny, Gigi, that you mentioned how your mom was obsessed with somebody. Because it's interesting to see how like fangirling kind of changes throughout the years.
[00:38:27.710] My mom, when she was younger, used to be obsessed with this cricketer in India. I forgot his name, but she used to have like notebooks with his picture on them that she would take to school.
[00:38:38.710] Yeah, because back then, like, you know, sure you can watch the television and watch their games, but there's not that much content. Like we have a plethora of content now, but like, I think for her, it was just like having that notebook was just like enough.
[00:38:52.870] That is her obsession. Yeah, that's so cute. I think my mom had mentioned something about like going to the like CD store or something when albums would drop and like lining up outside and like trying to get the CDs too.
[00:39:06.870] And I was like, oh my god, it's like such a different generation. For us, we're waiting for like our favorite fanfic to drop on like AO3 or some shit. Oh my god.
[00:39:16.030] Jeecey, to bring it kind of back to the Broadway show you were watching with James, did you wish that he was more supportive and like wanted him to be involved in your obsession?
[00:39:26.030] Or were you like, oh, you know what, it's fine. It's just for me. I'm glad you're here, but you don't have to do anything. I think the way that James reacted to my Kendall Roy obsession was probably as good as it gets if I'm being honest.
[00:39:37.190] I was really in there for a while into that hole. But, you know, James like rewatched Succession with me. He actually was the one who introduced Succession to me in the first place.
[00:39:48.190] He like reluctantly drove me to Barnes & Noble to buy that GQ magazine. And if I'm being honest, the Broadway show that I took him to was like on his birthday weekend. So he even had to like go to New York with me to watch the show with me.
[00:40:05.350] So I think he was as supportive as it got. And what's actually really funny is when we were getting signatures from Jeremy Strong after the show, me and James had separated because I wasn't sure if he was going to come around and sign everyone.
[00:40:18.350] So we were like, OK, let's try to like divide and conquer and get as close to the fence as we can from like two spots.
[00:40:24.350] So he came around and like signed my playbill. But when he got to the place that James was at, which was kind of at the end, I think there were a lot less people.
[00:40:31.510] So James actually got to take a selfie with him and have like a full conversation with him. James told me he was like, oh, congrats on the show. You're awesome. I can totally see you getting a Tony, which he did end up getting a Tony for it.
[00:40:44.510] So I was just like, you know, James isn't like the true fan here, but he's like the more successful fan. He got a selfie with him. Oh my God.
[00:40:53.670] But that's nice that he was like willing to rewatch Obsession with you and kind of live vicariously, I guess, kind of through you at a distance. Yeah, he's like, you can do it, but just know that I'm not like 100 percent happy.
[00:41:09.830] Yeah, I guess it's like interesting if you are like in a relationship and you have an obsession. As I said, I'm like obsessed with Kristen Stewart lately. So I've like made my boyfriend watch at least five Kristen Stewart movies with me.
[00:41:27.830] And then at one point after we finished one of the movies, I turned around. I was like, sorry, I'm making you watch all these movies starring Kristen Stewart. And he was like, no, it's OK. Like some of these movies are bangers.
[00:41:40.990] I was like, oh my God, yes, her art is coming through. Oh my God. You recruited one other person? You're like, yeah, you're right. You're welcome. He's like, I guess I can see some of the charm that you're talking about. Do you have a favorite movie of hers?
[00:41:59.150] Well, this one's not my favorite, but I think it's an underrated movie that she was in. It's called Underwater and it's kind of like this, this like thriller slash horror movie about getting out of this super dangerous situation underwater at the bottom of the ocean.
[00:42:17.150] Its release wasn't huge, but I feel like people who watched it enjoyed it because it's just like very straightforward. There's no over promising under underrated movie. There's no over promising under under delivering. And there's also no like under delivering and over promising. It does what it wants to.
[00:42:36.310] Yeah, I feel like Kristen Stewart is actually a really good fan girling celebrity for you because as you mentioned, she's a good actress and she has a lot of content, but it's not like in your face. Yeah, she does a lot of like indie films.
[00:42:50.470] Dude, I'm like kind of laughing because when I was like at the peak of my obsession, any sort of video streaming platform on my phone or like iPad could open and go to the search and it would just say like Jeremy Strong on it.
[00:43:04.470] So there's so many lunches where me and James were like, oh, let's like watch something really quick during lunch. And then we would go on HBO and then he would like search, go to search something. It's like Jeremy Strong. He's like, bro, are you kidding me?
[00:43:14.470] I feel like if we opened Crystal's phone right now, like your thing would also be like Kristen Stewart. Dude, like my YouTube homepage, a lot of the recommended is like Kristen Stewart interviews. I just can't believe Jisoo that you're so obsessed with Kendall.
[00:43:35.470] Like I can't, for some reason that's still so hilarious to me. Like I've just never had somebody because, you know, the thing is that like usually when people are obsessed with somebody, you know, a big singer or a big celebrity.
[00:43:49.630] But this is just such and Succession was a really popular show. Don't get me wrong, but it's not necessarily a show that has characters that you would fangirl over.
[00:43:58.630] So it's just like the fact, I don't know, the fact that it's Kendall Roy is just really getting to me. It's just so funny. I see you like intermittently laughing, like cracking up throughout the episode. Like, oh my God, Kendall Roy.
[00:44:11.790] Every time you mentioned his name, I'm like Kendall Roy. It's so random. I feel like it's also worse too for the people who have actually seen Succession. Exactly, because there's literally like parts in the show where he's like shitting in his own pants.
[00:44:28.790] And I'm like, how are you obsessed with this man? And Jisoo's like, yes. I'm like slay king. It's unexplainable. Truly, truly. We do often like to say Jisoo has a unique taste. Is there anybody else that you've been obsessed with that's been weird?
[00:44:48.950] Not weird, but out of the norm. I mean, I guess I had like a mini Nicolas Cage thing, but it wasn't like, you know, I wasn't like, oh, he's so hot. I was just like, this guy is like a legend.
[00:45:00.950] And then I was like into Anthony Davis and I was like, oh, he's so hot. And then I was like into Anthony Davis for a while. Okay, you know what? It's just not a good track record for me.
[00:45:13.110] James is always like, oh my God, like these men that Jisoo really like, what does that say about me? He's always like, Jisoo has the worst taste in men. Jisoo's like, I married you. Yeah. I got one right.
[00:45:31.270] I think most people probably go through some sort of quote unquote obsessing or just like really get into like fan culture. And I thought it was really fun for us to talk through what captures our interest and how our fangirling has evolved over the years.
