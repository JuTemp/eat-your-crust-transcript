[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Vince.
[00:00:16.130] So if you recognize Vince's voice, then you might be a very long-time listener. Vince was actually on the podcast on episode 31, Accepted Med School, and now he's back today to talk about all things roommates. But before we get into the topic today, Crystal, let's hear your Gen Z word this week.
[00:00:36.470] All right. So this week, once again, it is a phrase, let him cook. That's the original phrase, but it can be used in any way, like let her cook, let them cook, whatever. Basically, what this phrase means is just let whoever, the person that we're talking about, let them just keep going. Continue cooking their meal, I guess, if we want to stick with the metaphor.
[00:01:02.350] I guess one of the common things is maybe like if some guy is trying to flirt with a girl, his friends in the background would be like, let him cook. I guess another example that might be pretty common is like in sports. If someone is maybe making a questionable play in basketball, people would kind of be like, oh, like shit, what's happening? And then the dude scores, then everyone would be like, let him cook. I think who let him cook is if he fucked up.
[00:01:29.930] Exactly. So I guess there's like two variations of it. Let blank cook and who let blank cook. Wait, I've never heard the anti cooking aspect, I guess, of this meme. Like I've only heard hold up, let him cook or something like that. And I actually hear it somewhat frequently in real life because James and his friends say it a lot. And every time they say it, it's so funny to me. Like, I don't know what it is about the phrase, but it always makes me laugh. Yeah. You're like, you guys don't even know how to cook.
[00:01:58.810] I know. Like nobody's cooking except for my ass. How about you guys? Do you think you hear this one a lot in real life? I feel like it's starting to get pretty common recently. I feel like I see it a lot on like Twitch. It's like mainly where I see it. Definitely. In a lot of just like anything competitive, sports, gaming, it's super common to be like, fuck, who let me cook? Or, you know, people will be like, nice, let him cook to like cheer for them or egg them on.
[00:02:27.730] So definitely pretty common in those like competitive aspects. Yeah. And I guess in real life, the context of how I hear this phrase being used, sometimes, you know, when people start talking, they get kind of like lost in their thoughts. And then they kind of like lose momentum on what they were trying to say. And then they'll be like, oh, you know, and like start like stuttering or like hesitating a little bit. And then I feel like sometimes people will be like, hold up, like let him cook or something like that, which I guess isn't really as relevant to like the sports example.
[00:02:57.110] But maybe it's just easier to use it that way. Yeah. Oh, my God. I actually have a really funny story about this phrase. I was at a party once. It was kind of warm to a lot of people in a small ish apartment and someone passed gas. And it was it was obvious not in the sound, but in the smell. And and someone was like, oh, my God, who let him cook?
[00:03:26.870] But like also no one knows who passed the gas. But I just thought it was so funny that someone like use that phrase at that moment. Yo, what if it was the guy who said who let him cook? Perfect rhyme. What is that rhyme from like when we were kids? Whoever smelt it, dealt it. Oh, my God. A classic. But yeah, that was like a very funny moment.
[00:03:54.990] I guess like for me, this phrase, as Vince said, I've also seen it a lot in like Twitch gaming sports. But I've also seen it on TikTok here and there. But I have like no idea where it came from. I guess originally I thought it was from sports. But also I thought about it. I was like, OK, no one is cooking in sports. Like there's no way that the origin is from sports.
[00:04:23.510] So I looked it up on one of our favorite websites, knowyourmeme.com. And they say the origin of Let Him Cook is actually the rapper Lil B. He had a song back in 2010. And in that song, he had the phrase, let that boy cook. Bay Area legend. I think it even has a dance move, too. Oh, really? Yeah. You like stir a pot, basically. Is that where the Steph Curry dance comes from?
[00:04:52.390] I don't think so. But if I'm thinking of the right thing, there's the associated dance move, too. Oh, interesting. Entrenched in Bay Area lore. So we are the correct users of this slang. Yeah. That's why I actually recognize this one. It's a rare day. It says, though, that one of the first, I guess, viral usages of it was back in 2022. A Twitter user tweeted, let him cook.
[00:05:22.250] There was also attached to the tweet a photo of a dude flirting with another woman while at an NBA game. So it's like, let this man riz it up. Yeah. I actually forgot how to use the word riz, but let him riz. No, that was right. The second one was wrong. The first one was right. We can edit that out. No one has to know. Let him riz. Who let GZ cook?
[00:05:50.470] GZ, you're supposed to be our Gen Z expert. Dude, I'm washed. I'm washed. Who let her cook? I'm tired of fucking cooking, okay? No, but actually, I think this is probably one of our most easily applied Gen Z words that we've talked about. And it's three whole words, which in our episode with Michelle, I said, if there's too many words, I'm not going to say it. But this is our one exception.
[00:06:18.430] Bringing us back to the topic of the day, which is roommates. Let's jump into this by talking about what makes a good roommate and how do you try to be a good roommate? I think I'm the perfect person to talk about roommates because over the years, I've lived in basically every iteration of a single, double, triple, and a quad. Wow. And I've done this in the dorms. I've done this in an apartment, in a studio, and now in a house.
[00:06:44.750] I've basically gone through every possible roommate experience you could ever have. And I'm only a little bit offended that the only thing special about me and is worthwhile to talk about is the fact that I live with other people. I'm also pretty good at it because I usually see other people being good roommates. And then I'm a shitty roommate. I think, like, objectively. Well, then what makes you a shitty roommate? This is one thing I realized in the apartment I moved out to after we left the dorm.
[00:07:14.050] So I was living with, like, a bunch of my friends. It was six of us in a three bed. So we were, like, in a setup where we had two people per room in each bedroom. I feel like a good roommate, you know, you're, like, really mindful. Like, some of what the other people in my house did was they, like, knew everyone's schedules as far as, like, when people are trying to go to sleep, when people wake up and what classes they have. And knowing, all right, let's be mindful of when they have to go to bed and not be loud later or in the mornings.
[00:07:42.790] Like, let's make sure to just try to, like, work around people's schedules so that when people have to wake up and get ready for their day, that you're not, like, hogging the space and, like, they're not being held up. They're not going to be late to things. I realized this after, like, three years. They've, like, finally told me. But I just take, like, 45 minutes in the bathroom, like, every morning just to go through my full routine. It's probably not actually 45 minutes. But it's a long fucking time. There was, like, one time where I was just complaining.
[00:08:12.950] Because, like, every now and then it would happen where I'd, like, go to bed. And I'd be, like, fully ready to go to bed. And the last thing I have to do is brush my teeth. And then someone would, like, go into the bathroom and, like, start taking a shower and, like, be in there for a while. This happened a few times. I'm, like, always complaining about it. And then, like, I actually brought it up to the people who were doing it. Like, shout out to Wesley, like, one of my old roommates. And then he was, like, you do know that every morning for, like, the last three years, we're late all the time.
[00:08:41.970] Because we always have to plan around. Like, we have to wake up earlier to get into the bathroom before you. Or we just have to, like, just skip it. Because you're just in there when we're all trying to wake up and get ready for class. And, like, I had no idea. I didn't even think about it. Because, like, I was, like, go through my full, you know, like, the tour de France through the bathroom. Like, I brush my teeth. I go take a shit. I go take a shower. You know, after, like, I had no skincare routine. So I'm not really sure what happened. Like, where the time went. But, you know, things were happening.
[00:09:10.030] Next thing you know, it's, like, 8 o'clock and everyone's late. It just never occurred to me that this was a problem. Because I would get out and there'd be nobody waiting. Like, I just always assumed that if it was a problem, someone would, like, knock or something. But everyone was too nice to, like, bring it up to me. I only found out after years later. And I was, like, oh, maybe I should, like, think more about how I'm affecting the other people in my apartment. But it was, like, too late. They just, like, suffered for years. And I had no idea. Wow. Wait, so you all shared one bathroom.
[00:09:38.530] So we had, like, we had four people. There was two bathrooms in our apartment. So there was four to, like, the smaller one. And two people used the master bathroom. We were sharing that room. I think we eventually, like, banished one person and forced them to only use the master bathroom. Just to have an even split. But in the earlier days, we did, like, a four or two. And it just, like, in practice didn't really work out that well, as I found out. Wow.
[00:10:03.190] That brings up a good point, though, which is, like, so much of being a good roommate is your behavior in kind of, like, shared spaces. So, like, definitely sharing a bathroom I feel like is a decently big pain point. Usually it's probably all good and fine. But it definitely isn't as easy sharing a bathroom versus, like, having your own. So coordinating around other people's schedules I think I can definitely relate to. Back in college when Crystal, myself, and Jessica and I lived together.
[00:10:33.130] Three people to one bathroom is not bad. But then there would be times where all of our boyfriends would be over. So it was, like, six people, one bathroom. And that was a little bit of a struggle. To be fair, it was two bathrooms but one shower. Right. But still, we were very amazed. We were, like, because no one really used the downstairs bathroom. But somehow we just, like, never collided. It was, like, we were taking numbers at the DMV. Yeah.
[00:11:02.470] And I'm trying to remember if we had, like, a morning shower, like, evening shower kind of schedule. Because I feel like staggering that can really help. I think I, on average, showered in the evening, possibly. But then I also slept late. And then if I did shower in the morning, I woke up late. Usually. Totally. I just remember you, Jisoo, always woke up pretty early.
[00:11:28.530] And then for me, like, the earliest I would wake up would maybe be 8 a.m. And that was, like, really early for me. Amazing. I think the other weird thing, too, about sharing a bathroom, especially with, like, a decent number of people, is there's kind of, like, a thing about bathroom space. And I think if you have a bigger bathroom or a bigger shower, which ours, I would say, qualified as, like, slightly bigger, then it's not a big deal.
[00:11:54.170] But sometimes, even in the shower, like, the tub doesn't have a ton of space to put, like, shampoo bottles and stuff. So then that gets a little crazy. I remember once I was, like, visiting a friend and then I showered in her dorm bathroom. And then on the ground, there were, like, 10 shampoo bottles, 10 conditioner bottles and 10 body wash bottles. And I was, like, dude, the shower space is, like, halved because there's so much stuff on the ground. Wow.
[00:12:22.270] Because there was no, you know, storage space on the wall. So that was a little bit crazy. Wait, that's crazy. 10? Yeah. One for every day. You never know what kind of mood you're in. You need a different fragrance. Oh, I guess, like, back in the day in college, for, like, dorm situations, at least for me, I kept my shower stuff in my room. I bring, like, the little shower caddy to the bathroom. Right. But I guess that dorm was just, like, fuck it. Our shower stuff lives here now. Yeah, basically.
[00:12:51.850] I was, like, wow, this is, like, a culture shock. But it kind of makes sense in a way where it's, like, you're not just sharing the bathroom or, like, usage of it. You're also sharing, like, the surface area of the bathroom pretty much. I would definitely never trust my shit in the shower and everyone's face. Because, like, when I first moved into the dorms, I didn't have shower slippers for, like, three days. I'm pretty sure I got immediate athlete's foot. Oh, my God.
[00:13:18.370] Oh, my God. Because there's just a mountain of pubes just left on the ground of the shower.
[00:13:48.350] Oh, my God. That's so nasty. And it was even, like, it was just, you know, they were just showering and, like, they're shaving and it falls on the ground. You don't see. Like, I can never see what the fuck's happening in the shower because my eyes are horrible. So I have to blind myself every time I go in the shower because I take my glasses off. So it's like, oh, you know, you can't see it on the ground. You know what happens. But no, it was, like, presented into a mountain. So it was, like, purposely left as a message to the rest of us. Oh, my God.
[00:14:14.370] Because, like, they, like, scooped it all up and put it into, you know, it's, like, a deliberate action. There's no way it's an action. Oh, my God. So, you know, that was what was happening in my dorm. And then I chose to live with those same people in our three-bed apartment. So. But why? So that's a bad roommate activity. So if your roommate is leaving cubes around, maybe that's a bad sign. I don't know. Yeah, they were trying to show dominance or something.
[00:14:42.010] Just the sheer volume, you know, we just knew, like, you know, this is the king of the castle. Still have no idea who did it. So, you know, whoever it was. Checked everyone's, everyone's cubic mouth. Like, who has the cleanest shape? We considered it. We considered it. But we had just met each other. It was probably, like, the first week. You know, I think after a couple years, we reached that level, you know, as everyone does. But we weren't quite there yet. So by the time we were friends like that, the evidence was already gone.
[00:15:12.250] See, that is so crazy to me because, you know, I know there's this whole discourse about, like, do friends always make good roommates or do roommates always make good friends? And it sounds like you and your roommates have become super good friends. Oh, not all of them. There's one guy. He knows who he is. Oh, the potential pube bandit. But yeah, I just don't know how comfortable I would feel living in a space like that after I saw something like that personally. Same.
[00:15:39.930] I probably would have been like, dude, not these people. You would think. There was, like, so many incidents. I think by the end of the year, we were just numb to it. And it just, like, didn't even bother us anymore. Dude, so many incidents. So you're telling me that, like, things kept happening. And then at the end of the year, you were like, yeah, I would live with all these people again. Of course. Of course. That is crazy. You don't really know someone until you know what their pubes look like. I see.
[00:16:08.790] Because, like, it wasn't even the worst thing. I think the first three incidents we have, like, within the first month, coincidentally went PB&J. So there's pube bandit. Then there was booger bandit. So there was, like, someone who every time they were taking a shit would pick their nose and wipe boogers on the inside of the door of the bathroom. No way. And then, like, someone put up a sign that was like, hey, please stop wiping your fucking boogers on the bathroom door. And then they wiped boogers on that sign. Honestly, that was crazy.
[00:16:38.150] Oh my god. Dude, the audacity. So there was that. And I think we had a suspicion of who it was. It wasn't just our suite that used that bathroom. There was, like, two rooms out in the hallway that were bathroomless. So they had the access to our suite. So I feel like we just kind of generally blamed them for all of our problems. Just, like, you know, them. So that's why, like, I feel like I could justify it to myself. Yeah, I'll live with these people. It's all good. It was, you know, it was those guys. It was the hallway guys. You know, it wasn't my thing. They would never do that.
[00:17:08.130] Wait, that means you shared your bathroom with, like, potentially around 30 people. No, no. There was only, like, it was two rooms. So it was, like, four extra people. So our suite, I think, had, like, 10. And then there was, like, four extra people that would come in. So, yeah, we just blamed them for all of our problems. And then there was Jizz Bandit. So this one, I don't know if this is real or not. It's still widely debated. At least what happened for this one, it was, like, the same kind of thing. You know, like, peaceful fall day.
[00:17:37.690] We're all sitting in our rooms, hanging out, doing homework or some shit. And all of a sudden, we just hear, like, this was the most frantic screaming that we heard. So someone is, like, terrified, making a ruckus in the bathroom. And we, like, all, you know, filter in. Because we're like, all right, what the fuck's happening this time? Like, god damn it. And I don't really know if this is real. But one guy is, like, he's basically, like, an inch away from the toilet seat. And he's just pointing at this one stain.
[00:18:06.270] And he's screaming, like, look at this shit, guys. Who did it? Who did it? Was it you? Was it you? He's, like, going up to each and every one of us. And we're like, what are you talking about, man? He's like, that's Jizz on the toilet seat. Don't ask me how I know. But looking at that stain, how that stained, that's Jizz. And, you know, like, none of us are really going to argue about it. But he was, like, going on this huge tirade about it. But allegedly, someone had left, you know, a present for everyone else on the toilet seat.
[00:18:36.370] We actually set up a stakeout where, like, we would have, like, a rotating shift of people that would, like, kind of wait outside near the bathroom until they heard anything, like, through all hours. And then they actually heard someone in there making, like, suspicious noises and waited until to see who came out. And that's who we thought. Was the potential Jizz Bandit. But there's another, like, there's factions to it.
[00:19:05.510] Some people believe in Jizz Bandit. Some people don't think he's real, like Tana. Because one of my new roommates, he's, like, a really friendly guy. So he'll, like, take shits next to people. They'll be talking, having conversations, holding hands, you know, all the usual things. And allegedly, one time he took a shit next to Jizz Bandit. And he heard him mid-conversation making those noises. So he's like, there's no way. There's absolutely no way. Hmm. Interesting.
[00:19:32.890] I don't know if he's just trying to protect his, like, his own psyche. Like, he's like, there's no way this possibly happened. Just so he can, like, preserve his, like, beautiful memories of freshman year. But we, I think for the most part, it's really just that one guy who thinks that Jizz Bandit isn't real. But the rest of us were convinced from our stakeout activities. We had a lot of weird stuff going on.
[00:19:55.010] Like, we actually made a card with, like, a gift to our, like, janitor lady who would come by and clean up our bathroom and suite. Because we felt so bad for her by the end of the year. Oh, man. That sounds like some horror stories that I don't know if I would ever recover from. Those were pretty traumatic stories. But I guess aside from the bathroom, there's kind of other, like, common spaces that people tend to share. Sharing a kitchen, for example.
[00:20:25.130] I think there's a lot of confusion that can come with sharing a kitchen with someone. I've seen some roommates share, like, plates and utensils and sometimes even, like, groceries and stuff. And other times people are super separated about it. So each roommate will come armed with, like, their own set of plates, own set of cups, etc. So I guess for both of you, what is kind of, like, your preferred method? And have you tried both methods, I guess? In, like, all of my situations.
[00:20:54.370] Except when I was living with Jessica, my girlfriend. That was, like, the only time when we shared things. Because I feel like if I was segregating our groceries in that kind of situation, that'd be a little weird. I think otherwise, we only ever really share things that make sense to share. Like butter, like eggs, bread or something. Dude, have you seen the egg prices? Just kidding. I think it's, like, normal again. But I think those are the only things that we've ever really shared.
[00:21:21.990] Like, in my house right now, we don't share our plates and pans. We all have separate. I think it's, like, when we first all moved out from the dorms into the apartment in college, we had no basis of actual things, right? So everything that we brought in was, like, things we all bought together. So I feel like when we first did that in undergrad, we shared our plates and our utensils, and that was all fine. We actually only had, like, one singular pan. So that actually caused a lot of problems.
[00:21:50.490] Because we had, like, six of us all cooking. It's like, if you're in team, like, soaking your pan versus just washing it immediately, that was the issue. Because there'd be a lot of times where I'd want to cook, and that one singular pan was at the bottom of our sink covered by, like, all the other plates and stuff. There was a lot of times where we just didn't cook because we lived above, like, a bunch of, like, Chipotle and Subway and shit. So silver lining is there's a lot of good roommate bonding activities when you go out to get food together because you physically can't cook.
[00:22:20.610] So maybe they were doing it on purpose. I don't know. Who knows? I feel like sharing plates and utensils and stuff is fine as long as people are usually good about cleaning up after themselves. Especially because, depending on how many people you're living with, it would take up a lot of cupboard space to share if everyone had, like, their own sets. Unless it was, like, everyone had their own single plate and single bowl and, like, single fork, you know?
[00:22:49.750] At least post-college, when I was in New York living with Obby, we shared utensils, plates, and cookware in general. But I will say that not anything against Obby, but I think just, like, in general, people probably do this too. Is if I had, like, something that was nicer, like a nice pot or, like, a nice pan, I would usually try to store it in a place that would be inconvenient for the other person to use.
[00:23:19.550] Because it's like, oh, shoot, if this is, like, a really nice pan or pot, you don't know. Like, someone might accidentally fuck it up without realizing that it was, like, a nice thing. That's true. So I've heard of people who will either keep it in their room normally or they'll just, like, store it in a, like, a less obvious spot to reduce the possibility of getting it accidentally mixed up with the, like, just standard things.
[00:23:45.990] Dude, I could totally picture you, I guess for context, Obby is super tall. I can totally picture you, like, stashing it in, like, the lowest possible cupboard, like, in the corner or something. Because, you know, he won't, like, bend down and, like, reach to get it. Actually, my tactic was, so I had this one pan that's, like, a carbon steel. So you have to oil it after every time you use it and, like, can't use too much soap on it. So what I did was I actually put it in, like, very plain sight.
[00:24:14.850] And I was, like, oh, yeah, if you want to use this pan, you need to wash it, like, this way. And then you have to, like, use this oil on it after and make sure it dries completely. And, like, basically telling him all the complicated steps. And Obby was just, like, yeah, that sounds, like, way too complicated. I probably won't use it. And I was, like, okay, cool. Man, I'm trying to remember, like, what we actually shared.
[00:24:39.910] Because, to be honest, I can't even remember what we shared and didn't share when we lived together in college. I have a vague memory of, like, bringing some of my own bowls and plates to school. And it was just, like, a couple of each of them. But I also have this weird memory of using, like, metal forks. And I know for sure I didn't bring any forks. So maybe, like, we shared some stuff. But I was once talking to one of my friends. And at the time, she was living with a bunch of her, like, college friends.
[00:25:09.070] And I was, like, oh, what's it like living with, you know, all your friends, roommates and whatnot? And she said, yeah, like, I love them. You know, like, we hang out all the time. But the one thing that drives me crazy is that they never fill the Brita filter. And, you know, I guess for anyone who's never used one, Britas take really long to filter water. So, like, if you want to drink water, you have to fill it. And then you wait probably, like, three minutes or so for it to all drip down.
[00:25:35.870] And I was, like, I can totally imagine, you know, myself being late, like, in a rush to get out, trying to fill my water bottle really quick. And then I'm just, like, standing there, like, twiddling my thumbs as the water drips through. So I was, like, that sucks. Ooh, that does suck. Yeah, I think we had that same problem in our apartment. I think we just, like, unofficially designate someone as that was their job to fill it up. Damn, that poor person.
[00:26:04.230] It was just more of, like, nobody else is doing it. And, like, I don't know who the Good Samaritan was. I can't remember. But I'm pretty sure it just fell on, like, one person to just, like, be on top of that. That's rough. Yeah. I was, like, when we moved in, we actually created, like, a schedule, a rotation of who was going to, like, clean and, like, do this and do that. We pasted it up on our wall and never touched it or looked at it or used it ever again. And we lived there for three years.
[00:26:30.250] I feel like those always seem like such a great idea, but they never actually work. True. But back on, like, Brita filters and stuff, one thing that me and Avi did was Avi drinks a lot of water. Me, not as much. But, like, I'm trying, right? So we actually just got one of those giant Brita filters. It's like a box, essentially. You get water from the, like, spout or whatever. So it can hold, like, a pretty good amount of water. So we just used that.
[00:27:00.330] But the downside, I guess, was that filling it up took a little longer. But it wasn't all that bad. Like, everyone was pretty responsible about filling up the Brita. I guess the thing about having just one or even two roommates versus having a lot of roommates is, like, if the Brita is empty, like, I know exactly who didn't fill it. You know what I mean? That's true. Versus if it's a lot of roommates, then, you know, some people can remain in the shadows a little bit.
[00:27:27.190] So I guess for Vince, since you have a lot of experience living in a house with, like, a ton of people, do you feel like that was pretty true? Where maybe some chores kind of tended to fall on one person? Or just some people didn't really carry their weight in terms of chores? I think what happened was I feel like it was all one collective failing by all of us. In that undergrad apartment, we started with six people. But over time, we, like, slowly collected more people. And we ended up at eight at the very end. Oh, my God.
[00:27:57.190] So we had, like, eight, but as, like, another layer to it, we survived, like, having a bunch of different subleasers. And then we also just had it set up where our apartment just kind of ended up being, like, home base for all of our friends. So we would just leave our door unlocked, and people would come in and out, like, any time. Like, we would have stuff happen where one of our friends would use the gym for our complex all the time. If he needed to, he would just run into our apartment and just take a shit if he had to.
[00:28:26.450] And just, like, things like that. So it's, like, already hard enough to identify who's causing problems with that many people living in there. But then we also just had random people filtering in and out all the time. There was, like, just enough things where you could tell, like, you know, you'd have, like, eyewitnesses. And it was basically, this will probably be disputed if any of them hear this. But I think it was, like, an equal share that everyone was causing problems.
[00:28:51.390] But, like, how it would happen, we would just slowly sink into just refuse and waste until it was kind of just the point where we were all just collectively disgusted with ourselves. And then we would band together to do, like, a full deep clean of our apartment. Interesting. Yeah, it would just have to build up until it was enough that we all felt like it was a problem. And then someone would go rally the troops. And then we would just spend, like, one weekend cleaning the shit out of our apartment.
[00:29:20.390] That actually sounds kind of fun. I guess not so much living in, I don't want to say filth, but living in filth for a while. But at least having, like, all of your best friends band together and, like, clean something together, I feel like sounds really rewarding and also sounds really funny. They were pretty good, like, as bonding experiences. I feel like it's, like, some of the core memories of, like, what we did beyond, like, all the things that led to our apartment getting into that state.
[00:29:48.190] But then also bring it back to a more normal, not really spotless kind of condition, but a little bit closer. I feel like each and every time we did the clean, it didn't get quite as clean as it used to be. Oh, no. So by the time we moved out, it was pretty bad. We got a surprising amount of our deposit back, is what I'll say. I'm just imagining maybe individuals, their rooms are, like, pretty clean and okay. And then the rest of the house is just, like, a mess.
[00:30:17.070] I think that's pretty much what happened. I think all of our rooms were kind of small. So there was, like, less potential, I think, to have it be a mess. I think also just, like, living with that many people, how it was set up was nobody really wanted to stay in their room really too much. I think we were all usually outside. I mean, like, obviously, if you have to do work or if you're doing something specific and you have to be at your desk. I think a lot of times, like, everyone's doors were open.
[00:30:44.710] We would all be walking in and out or, like, hanging out together outside. So usually, if there was going to be a mess, it would be outside. Wow. I don't think I would have survived in that situation. I feel like I would hate living there. Yeah. Okay, because I think I'm also the type of person to hang out in my room more. So I guess I would basically, like, ignore the rest of the home and just beeline straight to my room.
[00:31:14.370] And then I would probably take all of my belongings, remove it from all of the shared spaces, and just store it in my room. Because I'd be like, this place is a fucking mess. And then I probably would never use the kitchen. And I would just be like, okay, fuck it. I'm just gonna, like, buy every meal because I can't stand how, like, messed up the kitchen is. I feel like that's how I would survive in a situation where, like, the shared spaces were messy. Yeah.
[00:31:44.450] That's so funny, though, because I'm thinking about, like, when we lived together. And I feel like that was, like, you anyway. So it might be, like, your default thing. But kind of in contrast with Vince's story, right? I think you, me, and Jessica, we all kind of like to, like, chill in our own rooms, do our own thing. We definitely hung out, but it wasn't, like, all the time. So then whenever you walked in to our living room, which is what the front door opened to, I feel like it always looked like no one lived there, kind of.
[00:32:12.770] Like, there would sometimes be, like, recycling or something piled up. But aside from that, the sofa was empty. Like, the couch was empty. And I was always very, like, spotless is how I remember it. So kind of a funny contrast. That's true. I mean, I guess this kind of brings me to ask about, especially when you're living with a lot of people, isn't it kind of awkward to, like, use shared space? Like, what if you wanted to watch TV, but then, like, someone else wanted to watch something else on TV?
[00:32:42.110] I think we, like, surprisingly didn't have that many problems with it. I think if people wanted to personally watch their own show, they would just, like, be on their own, like, computer or whatever, tablet or some shit like that. But we actually watched a lot of shows together as, like, a collective. We watched, like, all of the first season of Yu-Gi-Oh! together, which was, like, unbelievably lit, actually. I think we watched all of Iron Fist together.
[00:33:09.570] We, like, hate-watched it because it was really rough. But I think it just worked out where a lot of our taste of what shows we like to watch all kind of synced up. It wasn't ever a problem if someone wanted, like, do their own thing or if someone was, like, planning something and they wanted to specifically use the TV or something. I don't think anyone really minded. So it could be. I could see why it'd be a problem, but it really wasn't.
[00:33:34.550] Yeah, I guess, like, that's one thing that I don't love about living with roommates is that I always feel like I'm intruding. Even if it's, like, okay, this is a shared space. Like, everyone has their right to use it. I'm always, like, okay, well, what if, like, what if my roommate wants to use the TV or something? Like, I shouldn't go use it. I'll just hide in my room and, like, do whatever I want on my laptop or whatever. I think that is a con of, like, living with roommates.
[00:34:01.150] Also, sometimes it's, like, what if you want to use the TV and then your roommate is using it? Like, I would feel bad to be, like, yo, can you get the fuck out? I'm trying to watch TV right now. That's true. That actually reminds me of there was this one summer where you and Jessica were both not in town, but I was in San Diego doing, like, a summer semester or something. So that year I lived with Crystal's brother and some random.
[00:34:27.030] Because I'm not close to Crystal's brother and I also don't know these people, like, we weren't, like, friends or anything, right? And I remember if I was hungry, I would listen to see if anyone was, like, in the kitchen using it. And then when I was sure that they weren't using it, I would go down and, like, use the kitchen. And after that, I was, like, damn. I, first of all, miss Crystal and Jessica. And second of all, like, I'm never getting random roommates ever again. And no fault to, like, your brother, of course, or, like, the strangers.
[00:34:56.250] But it's just, like, I don't like feeling that way, you know? So I was, like, okay, maybe not. Maybe let's not do this again. Dude, I do that regularly. I'm always, like, is someone, like, out there? And then I have to, like, even, okay, in New York, like, even if it was Avi out in the kitchen or something, I'd be, like, okay, am I ready to, like, leave my room right now? Yeah, I think that happened to us at the very end.
[00:35:21.950] I think that is, like, having, at least for us, it was, like, having randos be in the apartment that kind of made things more awkward, like, navigating. Because at the very end of that 1106 apartment, we end up getting, like, subleasers for, like, the very last summer after the end of senior year. I think we were staying through the summer before we all moved out. We had this one guy. We had two subleasers, and they were both bums. But one of them named Jesse.
[00:35:49.370] And no one could really figure out why he was in SD for just the summer. I think, like, he told us that he was doing classes, but he never went anywhere. So we were just all confused. Like, he moved into our apartment. And all he did was sit on our couch and use my Xbox to play 2K all day. And, like, not only that, he would drink all of our alcohol and just, like, day drink it.
[00:36:17.070] And he wouldn't even, like, hit people up to, I don't know, drink with them or, like, do something. He would just, like, drink it during the day, like, as he was playing. He would just be sipping on, like, cocktails during the day or something. And he, like, didn't shower. The only time he left the apartment was to go use the gym and come back. And he wouldn't shower. So he just, like, pressively just built up, like, a stench on the couch. So, like, none of us really wanted to confront him. So we just left him alone to, like, do his thing.
[00:36:44.090] Because, like, if you, like, would walk out of the bedrooms and you'd never look to the right towards the couch, you could kind of pretend he wasn't there. So that's what everyone did. But, yeah, he would just, he just locked down that entire area. Yeah. In that situation, that was the only time when we ever really had problems with, like, having to deal with people, you know, taking up your space, not being able to do what you want to do. So that was a time when everyone just ended up receding into their rooms and, like, only hanging out in there instead of going outside. That's actually wild.
[00:37:13.390] Did he ask for permission to use your Xbox or, like, drink the alcohol? Or was it just, like, one day you stepped out and he was on your Xbox playing 2K? I think he had moved in a little bit before. Or, like, I was, like, out of town for a while and I came back. And this was just my new reality where there was just some dude I didn't know using all of our stuff. Dang. I think he just snuck in there before everyone was really around because we were slowly filtering back in for the summer. I think when he moved in, there was only, like, one or two other people.
[00:37:43.570] I think it's, like, harder to confront someone when it's, like, a one-on-one, you know, because he was, like, kind of a big dude, you know? Like, we don't, it is what it is. You wanted to, like, 4v1 him. Yeah. But he just, like, inserted himself into that spot. And by the time we were all back in the apartment, it just felt like he had too much kind of momentum in being a bum rooted to our couch where we just couldn't beat it anymore. So we just left him alone. We're, like, you know, that's Jesse. He just, he's there.
[00:38:13.190] That's his thing. And we just tried to pretend he wasn't there. The crazy thing is, he wasn't even our worst subleaser that summer. Because. Oh, no. The thing that sucks about, like, not being able to use a shared space is, you know, you can't, like, go out there and enjoy the TV, enjoy the couch in the living room. But what ended up happening with our other subleaser was he ended up, like, ruining, you know, the sacred place that is your own bedroom.
[00:38:40.890] Because we had it set up where we all had doubles and triples. So one of our other subleasers, I forget his name. He was rooming with one of our other apartment mates named Dapo. And this dude, what he ended up doing was, like, Dapo would have to go to bed really early every day. So he would just get in bed early around, like, 10 or so. But this guy, this is another bad roommate thing, is, like, what I mentioned about being mindful of other people's schedules.
[00:39:11.070] So if you know your roommate has to go to bed early, probably what you shouldn't do is go in and cause a bunch of chaos and ruckus past his bedtime. You should probably do that somewhere else. But this guy, he didn't give a fuck. Like, this was, like, not really something he thought about. Because one night, our friend Dapo is trying to sleep. And this guy comes in and he brings back a Tinder date into this double. Oh, my God. And, like, Dapo's trying to sleep. And he comes in with his date.
[00:39:40.210] And he, like, looks over and sees him trying to sleep. And this just doesn't bother him at all. He's, like, all good. Not an issue. Because he's just, like, you know, the four or five feet between our bed, I think, is enough to make this kind of, like, a nice and separated space. This is enough where I can just take my date and we can just start banging and it's all good. Because that's what he does. And it's a pretty small room. And the window is closed, too.
[00:40:09.030] So I was in there trying to sleep. And all of a sudden, there's a ton of noise. A lot of stuff happening. And it gets, like, hot and, like, steamy in there. It's, like, a really small room. Oh, my God. And he's, like, too nice to confront him. So he doesn't say anything. He just pretends like he's still asleep. Oh, no. And just tries to, like, pretend that this is all a dream. I'm having a nightmare. Let's just, you know, ride it out. Go to sleep. But it just keeps going. He just can't ignore it anymore.
[00:40:37.470] But he's still not really willing to go and, like, say something. So all he does, he, like, reaches above his bed. This is, like, the far wall. His bed is up against the window. And he just cracks it. So he can get a little, he can just get a little fresh air. And he can breathe. And then, like, hopefully that's enough. You know, the cool night air is enough to make him believe that, you know, things are good and happy again. And he's, like, okay, all right. I can live through this. It's just one more night. And he tries to go back to sleep.
[00:41:05.550] But then the other dude, he sees this happen. And he, like, stops what he's doing. He gets up. He's fully naked. He walks over to his bed, reaches over his bed, and closes the window. Oh, my God. While, like, teabagging, basically. And then he walks back to his bed. And these are all, these beds are, like, three feet apart. And then he just proceeds. What the fuck? Wait, okay, I'm just shocked that this girl was down.
[00:41:36.850] Like, there's another fucking person in the room. It was a dark room. I don't know. You know, we can't make any judgments. But long story short, Dapo moved out, like, as soon as he possibly could. And then he got a new subleaser to claim his spot. And it was actually Jesse, the bum on our couch. Oh, my God. Dude, that's why he claimed the couch. Yeah. Because the room was stained already. When you have randoms as roommates, you know, things get really bad.
[00:42:06.190] So, really, just make sure you live with people that you can trust. Or people that you can beat in a fight. And this was during college, right? Just to clarify. Yeah. This was, like, in our senior year. So, this was, like, the very end of when we all lived together. So, it ended in infamy. It was, like, really, it was a lot easier to move out when we all hated being. Yeah. That's crazy. I'm sorry, but I just can't get over this story. Because I'm just trying to think what I would have done in Dapo's situation.
[00:42:34.190] Like, I don't know if I could have sat there. But it's, like, what else would you do? I guess maybe I could have, like, walked out of the room or something. Yeah. I was kind of thinking if it really got to the point, I'd probably just be like, I'm sorry. I have to go. I think the moment there was, like, a hint of odor, I would, like, get up and walk out. Dude. I think opening the window was a good idea. But I probably would have then jumped out. Yeah. Dude, college is crazy. The things we would go through.
[00:43:04.510] Would you now ever sleep in a double or triple or, like, more? Absolutely not. I don't know what level of desperation I'd have to be in to live in a double again. I just... I feel like, you know, after I moved out, that's when I moved into a studio with Jessica. And, like, we had, like, our own private space. I feel like I kind of realized. I was like, whoa, this is kind of nice. Because, like, you know, no hate on my old roommates. Great guys.
[00:43:33.410] But it is pretty nice just being able to have your own space that's, like, private. And you just have... Everything is how you want it. And nobody's messing it up. Or, like, you know, fucking while you're trying to sleep. Whoa. Technically, you're in a double still. That's true. I was going to say, like, after... I was in a triple my freshman year in college. Every year after that, I was in a single. But as soon as I graduated college, pretty much, I moved in with James.
[00:44:02.690] And I lost the privilege of being in a single. Because even if that's your man, that's a whole ass double, dude. It's not the same. Well, I mean, right now, I'm still in a single. Until, like, next year, probably, when we move back in together after, like, I graduate and all that. I think when we're living together, it is a double. But I think it's more of an issue for Jessica versus me. Because, like, the kind of theme of me as a roommate is, like, I just do my thing.
[00:44:32.130] Other people suffer the consequences. So... Oh, God. I feel like I just knock out. I just kind of roll around or do whatever, sweat everywhere. And Jessica's just, like, suffering. But then I just... I'm a super deep sleeper. So I have, like, no idea what's going on. So... Not so bad for me. You know? All good. Dude, I've actually never had a long-term roommate. Because in college, from the beginning, I always had a single.
[00:44:58.770] And it was actually one of my greatest fears to have a double or more in college. Like, going into it. I think it's a thing where, like, once you have a single, you can't go back. True. Like, you can start in hell in, like, the triples and quads. And you're like, oh, hey, this is just how it's always been. And then you go and you, like, you know, achieve Valhalla in a single. And you're like, I could never go back. That's so true.
[00:45:23.810] And I think one of the biggest things for me about being in, like, I guess, my current double. So, like, me and James. Is most things are okay. Like, seriously, most things are fine. Like, if you like listening to your music in your room, then you can put on AirPods. Like, if you like watching TV, you just watch it on your iPad instead of the TV, etc., etc. But the biggest thing to me that I had to get adjusted to was lighting. Because, like, if one person doesn't want to have the light on but you do,
[00:45:51.150] then I feel like usually it defers to the person who doesn't want the light on. For the longest time, I could only fall asleep with, like, a nightlight on. And not even just, like, the plug-in ones. Like, I would need, like, a lamp on to sleep. That was, like, one of the biggest adjustments for me. Like, living with James. Where I was like, okay, now I have to learn how to, like, sleep in utter and complete darkness. Just alone with my thoughts. So... Hey, man. James was there, too. You're alone with your thoughts? Oh, yeah. You're right.
[00:46:20.030] Alone with my thoughts and James. Which one is worse? The shitty thing for James is I snore kind of loudly. So, dare I say even trade-off? It's okay. He can always get earplugs for snoring. But, like... True. Light? You can't fake light. Right? That's true. That's facts.
[00:46:48.290] Alright, so I have a final question for you both. What is something that you miss about having a roommate? Or, for Crystal's case, a housemate? I think one good thing about having a roommate slash housemate is that if, like, you need help, they're usually... They're available to help. So, I guess one example that I can think of is one time me and Avi got sick.
[00:47:15.270] I think, like, Avi got sick first and then I caught it either from him or just, like, from someone else after. And so, at first Avi was dying, but I actually wasn't... I was, like, out of town, but then I was dying later and then Avi was like, yo, do you need me to, like, pick up medicine for you? Which is very helpful. Because if I were alone, I would have a harder time. That's true. This is, like, one of the biggest things about having roommates and housemates. Because I feel like you have, like, this connection with people that you don't really
[00:47:43.050] get otherwise with, like, just regular friends. Because you're having, like, people who are always around to, like, help you in your times of need. Like, one time what happened was, I think this was in, like, junior year or something. Like, a Friday night, late at night. And me and my, all of our roommates, we were all, like, really cool guys. So, we were sitting at home doing nothing. All of a sudden, we, like, hear this really quick knocking. It's, like, 1.30 or something. We're not really expecting anyone.
[00:48:09.750] It's, like, normal for people to come over, but it'd be kind of weird. So, we, like, go over and we look through the keyhole. And, like, all you can see. And by we, I mean, like, one of my roommates. Because I was just on the couch. And I'm on the couch throughout this entire incident. But one of my roommates walks over. And he looks through the keyhole. And all he sees is just some hair. And we don't really know what to make of that. We're, like, one of our housemates is always doing, like, really just weird, gooby things.
[00:48:38.430] So, we just assumed he was up to no good. So, he's, like, oh, whatever. Like, he opens the door. It turns out it wasn't one of our housemates. It was just some random drunk frat bro. And all of a sudden, he just starts yelling, you know what you did? And he tackles my housemate, Wesley. Oh, my God. He tackles him and just, like, pile drives him all the way across the room conveniently into a beanbag chair. So, like, it was, like, not that bad. It's, like, you know, he was a nice guy at heart for a drunk frat bro.
[00:49:07.750] But he, like, tackles him all the way across the room and just smashes him into the beanbag chair. And, like, the good thing about having roommates is, like, when you're struggling and you need help, your roommates will be there to lift you up. And luckily, Frank was there, our other housemate, because through when all this was happening, I think I was just so shocked at how absurd this was. I just didn't do anything. I just kind of peered over the side of the couch and just looked at Wesley struggling and wrestling this guy.
[00:49:37.710] And I was, like, hey, you good down there? And I didn't do anything. I just sat there. Oh, my God. Our other housemate runs out of his room because he hears all the commotion and sees Wesley struggling with this guy. And being a good roommate, he immediately springs into action and, like, grabs the guy and, like, helps and gets him off Wesley. And then he, like, lifts him away. He's, like, Frank is a pretty big dude. This guy is, like, squirming around fighting and he, like, throws him basically into this other wall to get him away from Wesley.
[00:50:06.690] And he's, like, dude, you got to get out of here or I'm going to call the cops. Like, get the fuck out of here. Damn. I'm seriously going to call the cops. And in response to that, the guy just starts, like, kicking around. He, like, knocks over our vacuum and, like, the dustbin, like, falls out and just sprays trash on the floor. Which probably made us get closer to our, like, monthly cleaning. So, honestly, it was kind of a good thing. But Frank, like, is pissed. He pushes him into the wall again. Tells him, he's, like, hey, man, like, seriously, get the fuck out of here. I'm going to call the cops.
[00:50:36.510] And, like, the impact of him hitting the wall was, like, enough to, like, briefly sober the guy up. Because all of a sudden, like, the film drops from his eyes and he's, like, oh, my God, where am I? Like, I'm so sorry, guys. I'm so sorry. Like, I'll leave. And then he, like, becomes drunk again. Because all of a sudden, Wesley stands up and the guy just, like, becomes unhinged with rage again. And he re-tackles Wesley into the beanbag. And, like, they start wrestling again. And, like, during this whole time, I still haven't moved.
[00:51:05.710] I just peer over the side again. I'm like, wow, this is crazy. As a good roommate would do. And then Frank comes over and, like, picks the guy up. And, like, together they, like, carry the guy out. Like a bar bouncer. And I throw him out. And, like, he gets back up and he tries to get back inside. And then they're, like, both telling him, like, dude, who are you? Just, like, get out of here. Like, we don't want you around. And then all of a sudden, like, this dude, he has his other friend show up. It's, like, this other drunk frat bro. And he, like, grabs the guy.
[00:51:33.870] And he's, like, dude, we're at the wrong building. Let's not this one. It's the next one over. And the guy turns. And he's, like, how can I know that I can trust you? He's, like, and, like, his friend turns to him. And he, like, stares into his eyes. He's, like, because I love you, bro. What? And then they hug. And then they just slowly walk away. And, like, the guy's, like, totally calm after that. It's one of the weirdest things that's ever happened to me. A pretty good time to have roommates.
[00:52:02.810] Imagine if you had to deal with that all by yourself. That's true. Jisoo, do you have anything that could... How am I supposed to follow up that story? Mine is going to sound so stupid now. But I guess one of the things that I miss about, like, living with people is it's just so easy to, like, do stuff together.
[00:52:22.470] You know, if I were to run errands or, like, I had to go do something and my friend was free, then it would be, like, an easy time for us to, like, catch up and, like, hang out while still doing stuff. Whereas now I feel like I wouldn't be, like, oh, hey, I know you live 20 minutes away, but you want to go grocery shopping together. So it's just not as easy. I have really fond memories of just hangouts, I guess, being a little bit less high stakes. If you wanted to hang out, you could just gather and hang out.
[00:52:49.910] Versus now, since everyone lives, you know, far apart, it has to be intentional and kind of, like, worth everyone's drive over. I just miss the days when we would have nothing to do, so we would just watch K-pop videos in the living room all night or, like, even, like, the morning after going out, just crawling over to, like, your room or Jessica's room and being, like, I'm hungover and, like, suffering together. Yeah, good times. Well, thank you, Vince, for joining us.
[00:53:17.870] It was really fun reliving some stories of having roommates and kind of just remembering the crazy things that we would do in college. I feel like there's no time, like, college in terms of, like, living with other people. So, yeah, and for our listeners out there, if you have any crazy roommate stories, feel free to hit us up on social media. You can find us at EatYourCrustPod.
