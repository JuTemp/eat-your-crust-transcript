[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal. So before we jump into our topic this week, I actually have a little mini funny story to share. And it always makes me nervous when I call something a funny story because I'm like, what if it's not actually funny? So I'll just say I have a story to share.
[00:00:28.570] Okay, okay. Don't worry, I'll laugh. So basically, yesterday was Sunday and James and I walked around our downtown area a little bit and then we grabbed dinner at this new little local joint that opened. And then afterwards, we took a little stroll around downtown. We stumbled upon the store and it looked brand new. And all I could see from afar through the windows was like it was really bright inside
[00:00:54.810] and kind of like an artsy display. You know those stores where there's like a line to get in and once you get in, there's only like 10 products on the shelf or something? Yeah. It kind of looked upscale like that. So we were theorizing about what kind of store it was. And I could see these puffy kind of cloud installations inside the store and other like lamp fixtures. So I was like, dude, that's a lamp store. And James was like, there's no way that's a
[00:01:20.570] lamp store because why would a lamp store be so nice and have three lamps inside? And I was like, okay, that's fair. So the whole time we're walking towards it and we're like trying to guess what it is. And then we finally see it. And the name of the store is very like discreet, but we eventually realized that it's a plant store, like a special plant store. I see. You know, we're intrigued and we've spent all this time like thinking about the store. So we go in, you know, it was really nice
[00:01:49.350] and like very clean and all of that. We had like waited a little bit in line to like even get into the store. So we were like, okay, fuck, we should probably buy something. Otherwise, we just wasted all that time in line for no reason. So we bought something, they gave us like a little bag. And it was like a really, really nice bag for a plant store. But it had the logo and like the label and like all of it was very clear on like what exactly you were buying. So it wasn't a very
[00:02:18.530] secretive or like subtle bag. So we take the bag and we're like, mildly embarrassed or whatever. We're like walking back to our car. When James says, Oh, there's actually another new special plant store. So many plant stores. I know. And this all within like half a mile or like even less, right? So he's like, yeah, like I saw it on Yelp, we should go look at it. And it was coincidentally, like right next to where
[00:02:46.230] we had parked to eat at the restaurant. Okay, we go there. There's another line. This one is also like nice and clean, but like slightly smaller and maybe less artsy and like upscale and all that. But it was still fine. We also wait in line for like another 10 minutes here. And I'm just like, okay, fuck now we have to buy something. But the problem is we walked in with like the bag of the other plant store. And it's like, so clear as day where we got that bag. James is like,
[00:03:13.010] you think they're gonna say anything or like notice that I have this bag? And I was like, yeah, they'll for sure like say something. And then we walk in and lo and behold, they do say something. And they're like, oh, so are you guys just testing out both stores? And is today the decision day on which one you like better? Oh my god. And me and James were just like, ha ha ha, like we just wanted to stop by. And then our faces just got like super red. And it was like mildly embarrassing as a consumer to get called out on something like that.
[00:03:41.050] Oh my god. That's so funny that they both had lines too. I know. Competition is fierce. Yeah, it was pretty interesting. The bag of the second plant store, it was just like a paper bag. The white paper bags where you would like put school lunch in it and stuff. And I was like, I kind of get it because it is more subtle. But then sometimes I feel like that makes it like more worse. Like, oh, you know, nothing interesting in this bag, but it's like screaming like, look at me.
[00:04:10.670] It's like when you have alcohol in a brown paper bag. Like, there's definitely nothing suspicious here. Oh my god. No, that's so accurate. That was the exact feeling we had. So we just like walked back to our car clutching these two bags. Oh my god, that's so funny. So have you looked at your special plants yet? Yeah, yeah, we've been looking at the special plants. And honestly,
[00:04:39.070] we didn't even need a single special plant. Like we were actually set out to buy zero special plants. But now we have two. So this just shows you how me and James are like, easy customers. You know, dude, wait, I saw a TikTok yesterday. You know, like those cozy game TikToks where it's like, soft voice and it's like, oh, these are like my favorite things on my desk. Okay, so it's kind of that vibe. So it goes panning over this person's cute little desk setup. And they're like,
[00:05:09.150] today I realized that my favorite hobby as an adult is spending money. Fuck, why is that so accurate? And I was like, oh my god, that is me too. That's what your story reminds me of. I feel like this is also one of the reasons why I can't do those things where it's like, oh, you can stay at this hotel for free if you just go to our timeshare presentation or something.
[00:05:36.070] Because I know my ass would walk out of there with like a timeshare. You're like, wow, only X amount of dollars. That's so good. Exactly. If anything, James would just enable you. Oh, yeah. You would enable each other. We would. We would be like, oh, you get a discount for buying too? But yes, that was my Sunday evening. How about you? Do you have any funny stories that you've,
[00:06:03.470] or I should say, do you have any stories that you've experienced recently? So I do have one. It's not happened quite yet, but by the time this episode is out, it will have already happened. Basically, right now I'm in Texas. And originally the only cities that I was going to visit were Austin and Houston. But the thing is, I have the Capital One Venture X card, which allows you to go to the Capital One Lounge.
[00:06:32.930] And right now, at this point in time, 2023, there only exists one Capital One Lounge. And it's in Dallas, Fort Worth. Oh, God. So you can kind of see where this is going, right? My thoughts were that I actually was thinking about downgrading my card or closing it sometime soon because I'm thinking of upgrading to a different travel card. But the thing is, I haven't been to
[00:07:01.370] that lounge because it's in Texas, in Dallas, like Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, which I've never been to. Right. So since I'm in Texas right now, I was like, okay, maybe I'll just swing by Dallas. I'll fly out of Dallas later. It's actually next week, Monday. I'll be flying out of Dallas. And I had to make sure I was flying out of the right airline terminal and everything.
[00:07:29.390] So I looked it up. I was like, okay, where's the lounge? I think it was terminal D. So that means that I have to fly with American Airlines, which I normally never fly with. So I literally made like an American Airlines account so I could get the miles and everything. Oh, my God. Bought an AA flight out of Dallas. So now I will be able to experience the lounge before I close the card.
[00:07:55.050] Dude, that is so funny. And it's also making me laugh how both of our stories are very like peak consumerism. Yeah, for sure. I was joking with my friend. I was like, yeah, I'm going to cancel my card as I am walking out of the lounge, flying out of Dallas because my task will be completed. I feel like another funny thing to me too. Sometimes when you tell me about your decisions and the things
[00:08:22.270] that you do for like fun and stuff, I'm like, dude, Crystal's life is basically just a video game that she's playing. You know, she's like, I need to unlock this achievement. But you're so right. Oh, my God. Honestly, sometimes it really does feel like that. I'm like, I need to go on this. This is a side quest, right? The Dallas airport lounge. I'm like, I need to go on this quick side quest so that I can complete this little checkmark. So that you can unlock the new
[00:08:51.830] credit card mission. Also, there's a funny moment where I was at the airport in the bay flying out to Texas. And I pulled up my wallet. And I looked at it and I realized I forgot my Capital One card. Oh, my God. And I was like, wait, I don't have my card. How am I going to get into the lounge? The whole time after sitting at the gate, sitting in the airplane before takeoff and after landing, I was like
[00:09:18.590] desperately searching. Can I still get into the lounge without my physical card? And luckily, I will be able to as long as I have the Capital One app, which I do have. So we're good. But there was a moment where I was like, oh, my God, I really fucked up my side mission. Like this, this whole trip to Dallas, and I wouldn't even have my card. And you would just be sitting on like the regular like seats outside of the gate, like other peasants.
[00:09:48.990] It would be so sad if I had this whole leg of the trip planned and the one thing I was supposed to do, I couldn't do. Is there something specifically that you're looking forward to for that lounge? Or is it more of like, oh, I have to use this benefit at least once since I have the credit card? Yeah, I think that's one of the big things. Like I want to be able to use that benefit at least once. Because I've used pretty much all the other benefits. That's been enough time for me to decide like,
[00:10:14.610] oh, I think I want a different travel card. Otherwise, also, the Capital One lounge is supposed to be pretty nice. So I think Capital One lounges is supposed to be kind of similar, a little more similar to the Amex level of like super nice, luxurious. So I was like, okay, I want to sit in a fancy lounge. I have the card. Why can't I, right? Right, right. It's just sad that it's only in Dallas. Hey, well, at least you get to do it. And it ended up kind of working out before you cancel your card.
[00:10:44.290] That's true. Yeah. By the time this episode is out, I will have enjoyed the lounge and maybe my card will already be gone. Well, you'll have to report back on how nice the lounge was. But let's kind of jump back into our topic of the week today, which is getting a new therapist. So we talked a little bit about our experiences with our therapists in the past. But I know Crystal, you've recently gotten a new one.
[00:11:13.690] So let's talk a little bit about that. How has the whole experience of getting a new therapist been for you? It's been kind of interesting. I think ever since I moved back to the Bay, it's been in the back of my mind like, oh, I should find a new therapist. And we kind of explained in one of the earlier episodes why I had to stop seeing my therapist in New York. TLDR is basically that most therapists are
[00:11:37.230] only licensed for one state that they reside in or like work in. So since I was moving out of New York state, that therapist wasn't licensed to therapize me in California. So she was just like, yeah, I can give you recs if you want recs. But otherwise, like, unfortunately, we will just have to stop. And I was like, okay, bye. So yeah, definitely, like, since I moved back in the back of my mind, I've been thinking
[00:12:03.030] about finding a new therapist. And I did do some searching. But for a while, for like, a good maybe five or so months, what I was looking for exactly wasn't coming up. So there were mainly three things that I'd look for. The first thing I look for is that they're a person of color, preferably Asian
[00:12:28.090] American, just because I think that makes it a lot easier for them to understand and relate. If I were to talk about like family or identity issues. Right. Second thing is, I prefer a woman because I myself am a woman. So I think, you know, once again, the like relating thing, it's just easier. I think especially because I've heard this from other people before too, where they're like,
[00:12:53.690] if I'm like a woman in therapy, let's say I, I'm like scared of men or something. Like, how would I tell my male therapist that right? So I feel like most women want like a woman therapist as well. And then the third thing was I wanted to do in person therapy in the Bay because in New York, it was completely remote because it was convenient at the time. And we were still just coming out of the pandemic for a while. So it is just like what worked best at the time. So yeah, I was like,
[00:13:23.670] I want to sit on a couch and like have a therapist write notes on me on clipboard and stuff. Right. So those are the three things I was looking for. And it took a while I would check periodically with the tool that I use to find therapists. And for a while, nothing that was fitting all three was matching. And so I just like, I kept waiting until finally, it was about May, I believe,
[00:13:51.110] April or May, that someone popped up that like fit all my needs. And so I signed up immediately. Oh, exciting. Yeah. So was your first session with her in person? Yeah, it was. So my current therapist, there's in-person sessions available and remote sessions available. So usually we just do in person, but sometimes we'll do remote if it's like she's not
[00:14:17.110] going to be in the office or it'll be easier to do remote. And also like a few episodes back where I explained, she was like, oh shoot, can we do remote today? And then I had to like take the call in a phone booth. But for the most part, we do in person, just as I hoped. So since you had a therapist that you worked with for a while in New York, and this is a new therapist that you're kind of getting to know, how did the whole process go for like the context building
[00:14:45.650] part, even coming up with issues? Because I feel like if you have some sort of rapport going on with your therapist already, you know, sessions are kind of like a continuation of what you talked about last time, or maybe there's like recurring themes and stuff. But with a new therapist, it's like brand new, right? So how did that whole like introductory process go? Yeah, that's actually so interesting, because I never specified this, but my previous therapist,
[00:15:12.650] a lot of the things that we talked about was relationship oriented, because I basically started therapy after a breakup from a really long term relationship. So a lot of the things we talked about was very personal, I guess, emotional, you know, like just relationship related. So I feel like because of that, the fact that it was like so specific, the initial reason for starting therapy
[00:15:36.510] was so specific, it helped kickstart the beginning a lot. It was just like, okay, like we're jumping in, we're like talking about this. And then it made us, I guess, like bond quicker, maybe. And then so for this current therapist, though, I don't think I had as much of a like, specific thing. I don't know about you. But for my therapist, I filled out a questionnaire. And at the end of it, it was like,
[00:16:03.450] what brought you to therapy, basically, what I filled that out with was a lot less specific than with my first therapist. So I feel like with the new one, there's like more of a, I don't know, like a slow buildup. Because to get to know each other in the beginning, we kind of just went through the questionnaire and like covered some of the more basic things, like what have you been feeling lately, like blah, blah, blah. And then she'll always ask about like, okay, so like, these are
[00:16:31.110] things that you said you want to come to therapy for. So you know, let's talk about any of these topics, which one do you want to do? It's kind of weird, because it's like, whoa, I don't know how to start this. That's true. I can totally imagine how you went from like, oh my god, so many updates or like so many feelings, because everything was probably very like fresh and raw and like ongoing. Yeah. Whereas when the stuff you want to talk about is maybe more like, simmered down to like
[00:16:57.950] a lower temperature. It's not necessarily like, oh, I have these three things on my agenda for therapy today. The first couple ones we just went through, I think she has a bit of a set list that we talk about, just like get a very basic understanding of her patients. So some things like, oh, you know, how's your family life? How have you been feeling at work lately? How's personal life? Like your friends, relationship, things like that. That took about like two sessions.
[00:17:25.410] And we touched upon like some personal history and things like that. I don't know, I guess like, it's very interesting, because I think I've had maybe like four or five sessions with her. But they've been not super regular. Sometimes I'll be like two weeks in a row. And then like, two weeks break, two weeks in a row again, and then like three weeks break because of like traveling.
[00:17:49.410] So I think because it hasn't been too regular in terms of cadence, it's still a little we're getting to know each other. It's like your first few dates with this new therapist. Yeah, yeah. And then the like breaks in between, it almost feels like starting over sometimes. Like you have a couple of breaks in the middle. So actually, in July, I'm traveling for a bit. And then she's also out of town for a bit. So we're just not going to have any sessions in July.
[00:18:19.090] And I was like, whoa, we're going to see each other next in August. Like, are we going to be okay? Will we stand the test of distance and time? Why LDR with my therapist? I kind of know what you mean, though, because I was reflecting back on like my first few dates with my therapist. And if I had to specify like a certain time point where I started to really
[00:18:47.330] lean on and look forward to my therapy sessions, not to say that I didn't look forward to them before, but it's like, there is kind of like a turning point where you can start to really trust your therapist. And for me, I feel like that point is when they say something that like blows your mind a little bit. That point probably came maybe like four to five months into our sessions. So it took a while. Yeah, it definitely did take a while. And she always had a lot of really insightful things
[00:19:13.550] to say and stuff. But I feel like the true insight comes after they like really know you. For me, personally, I also have to be in a space where I'm ready to take advice. Or I feel like I also need to like gain faith in this person's authority to be able to take that advice. Yeah, that was kind of the turning point for me. I guess it's probably I'm guessing it's a little bit early with your current therapist. But did you have a turning point like that with your previous therapist?
[00:19:38.710] I think a little bit, actually. I think like she gave me a suggestion of like an activity I could do to help me be more in tune with racing thoughts and emotions, I guess at the time. And I tried it and I was like, Oh, I felt like it was like helpful. My previous therapist was more of a like, she'll sit there and like listen as I give her all my updates, spit out all my words and stuff. And then she'll
[00:20:05.230] just be like, Oh, yes, seems like blah, blah, blah, just kind of summarize what I said to her. So then basically, I think that style makes you feel really like validated and seen or heard, which really worked out well during that period of time in my life. But I guess towards the end, it like loses steam a bit because you're like, Okay, well, I guess like, I'm okay now. Like, I don't have too much to
[00:20:30.370] to say anymore. Not only did we break up because of me moving. But also things kind of just came to like a natural end to I was like, Yeah, I guess I got most of the things that I wanted to say out there. And my therapist was able to like, listen and be like, Yeah, totally. Right. Yeah, I definitely think that's like, one of the components that I love about therapy is like
[00:20:55.970] having someone sit there and like, listen, and just like, kind of hear you for like what you're saying. But I totally agree that you also need the other part where they are giving you new insights and like are giving you new suggestions that can actually like help change your thoughts. Because sometimes I'm not gonna lie. And this probably makes me sound like a horrible patient. But sometimes I'm like, I could probably tell myself this or even when I'm like spiraling, for example, I'm spiraling in a loop
[00:21:24.070] where I'm like therapizing myself or trying to at least write like trying to bring myself back down to reason things that therapists sometimes say I'm like, Yeah, I know. And I've told myself that and the reason why I spiraled further is because I thought this and like, there's like all these thoughts that I already had before going into therapy. So I feel like that moment of like breaking that loop needs to happen. Otherwise, I would just be my own therapist. You know what I mean?
[00:21:49.690] Yeah, like they need to help you break that loop or like give a suggestion that can hopefully help you break that loop. Yeah, definitely. I think also with my current therapist, I'm in like a different place in my life. So we talk about different things in therapy now versus like me last year. And I think it has potential to be deeper than like, what my previous therapy sessions look like. Not to say that it was like,
[00:22:17.550] oh, my previous therapist didn't dig deep into my thoughts and stuff. It's more like now my brain is occupied by other things that are maybe like more deeply set into me versus like the immediate issue at the time. So I feel like because of that, maybe it's also like a little slower to or at least it feels a little slower to like build up because it's like, okay, when when will I feel ready to really like
[00:22:44.970] share something like this or like that or whatever? Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't think about how you also have to like open up and be able to reveal certain things about yourself, too, because I think I might have said this on the initial therapy episode that we did. But I definitely had my guard up for a little bit, where I was like, do I really want to talk about this? Or like, you know, I can talk about the issue. But how deep do
[00:23:11.370] I want to go into like my own thoughts and worries and like anxieties? Or do I just want to steer the conversation a certain way so that I don't have to talk about certain things? Right? Right. Because I think there's like, things that at a service level, you know, it's trauma, and you can call it trauma. And then there's also like your deepest, darkest things that you might not want to reveal. And it takes a while for those to feel ready to share, I guess. So I totally get
[00:23:36.190] what you mean. Yeah, I think one of my breakthrough points was I had a certain insecurity that I like hated talking about. And it was like, to the point where I would never even journal about it, because I didn't want to acknowledge its existence. And then once during therapy, it just like came spilling out. And then I was like, you know, but then I was like, okay, well, if I were to share this, like, this is like the forum to do it. And then we ended up like working through it. And I was
[00:24:02.050] like, oh, okay, this is literally why people go to therapy. Wait, that's awesome. But I totally get what you mean. Like some of the issues, you're just like, no, if I don't think about it, and I don't acknowledge it, then I can just cover it. Yeah, sweep it under the rug. Actually, me and my therapist, my new one, we talked about sweeping things under the rug. But anyway, I totally get
[00:24:29.150] what you mean, though. And I think like, along the lines of vulnerability and stuff, I think it also just takes some time for anyone to feel comfortable with anyone else, like therapy or not, to share more about yourself, because there's always the fear of slight judgment, right? And even though you literally pay therapists to not judge us, there's still like kind of that inevitable thought, right?
[00:24:56.590] Like, oh, God, what if I share this? And my therapist is like, what the fuck? Like, you're too fucked up even for me. Wait, no, that's exactly right. It's like, there's still a person, you know? Yeah. So you still have that fear. I think that's like, probably the biggest thing that I'm getting close to with this therapist, like getting more and more vulnerable bit by bit, and then feeling more
[00:25:22.350] comfortable to the point where I'm like, oh, okay, like, if I say this, she probably won't judge me. I think right now, I'm probably like a little polished in our sessions. If you know what I mean? I'm like, okay, I'll share these certain things. And sometimes I'm like, oh my God, nice. I did this thing that we talked about in therapy last week. So I can tell her how I successfully, you know,
[00:25:44.710] like pulled it off and then she'll think I'm great. Best client ever. That also made me kind of reflect on my relationship with therapy kind of. And I realized that in therapy, you've mentioned this before that you like to make your therapist laugh. Right. Well, I like to make my therapist compliment me.
[00:26:11.190] You're like, aren't you proud? Aren't you proud? Wait, literally. Like one of the most recent examples I can think of is we talked about anxiety grounding techniques, how to like bring yourself back down from anxious moments. So that particular time I had a session, two sessions back to back like weekly. So second week I go in and I'm like, oh my God, like I have a great story to tell you. I was spiraling
[00:26:38.610] and having a bit of anxiety and I did what you like what we talked about last week. And I like grounded myself and I felt a lot better after. And she was like, wow, like I'm so glad you did that. Like good job. I was like, yes. Oh my God. That's so funny. I feel like because we seek different things from our therapist in our own inner desires, like what I'm super happy about is like totally different from you. Recently, I feel
[00:27:07.030] like my therapist and I have been kind of closer or like being more personal and stuff in our sessions. I was like, oh my God, did I like break down her wall a little bit? Or is this just how she is with like, you know, older clients? Because she started sharing stories, short stories, but like brief mentions about her personal life and how it relates to mine. And then she also started having less of that like therapist shell of like, oh, I'm like a neutral party kind of. I shared some story. I was
[00:27:36.750] like, oh yeah, like, isn't this fucked up? And she's like, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. And I was like, oh my God, wait, that's awesome. I know. I was like, are we besties now? Like, holy shit. Dude, I look forward to when I reach that point. Okay. That also makes me think like, do our therapists also have like mini milestones for like breaking down walls with their clients? Does our therapist go home and talk to their husband
[00:28:03.670] or their partner? And they're like, oh my God, my client cussed in our session today. Like, you know, I think she's really opening up to me. Why is that so funny? But I feel like so true. Because now that I think about it, I don't think I've sworn in my sessions yet. You need to drop some F-bombs. Dude, you're right. I'll prepare some stories with some F-bombs.
[00:28:32.370] Think of some dramatic stuff. And I'll have to tie in with me doing something right that we talked about in therapy. So that you and your therapist can exchange achievement milestones. Yeah, exactly. But I do think there's a lot of history building as well as just like vulnerability buildup. It's been about like four or five sessions in. We've talked about a decent amount,
[00:28:58.190] but at the same time, it's like, oh, we've just like scraped the surface of one topic kind of, but there's still other things that haven't even touched yet. That makes sense. And I think that's like when therapy starts to get and feel really good too. When your therapist is like, oh yeah, like you mentioned this before or like, oh, I remember this pattern or something from like the past sessions. And you're like, oh my God, yes,
[00:29:24.250] we're getting to like the good part of therapy. You're like, yes, tell me what's wrong with me. Yeah, exactly. I was thinking recently reflecting back on my sessions and I was like, we've made some like decent progress in this particular subject area. But then I was like, dude, but we haven't even gotten to like the juicy gossip part of my life. My life probably seems pretty boring to her right
[00:29:51.190] now. It's just like, I feel these things. I feel like there's a whole backstory filled with like drama and like tea that she's yet to break into yet. This is also funny to me because for me, I feel like every session I like try to pack as much as I can to like get my money's worth. As I've mentioned in the past, I'm like, okay, I need to talk about like these three stories in the session. It's not like I'll watch the time, but I'll like make sure
[00:30:19.050] that we get to all these things in that one session. But for you, I feel like it's like, okay, intro to crystal, like crystal 101. And then you like, after you graduate from that, you can move on to crystal 102. And then you don't get to like the upper division classes or like the elective classes until later. Dude, actually though. Okay, so I feel like usually the juicy topics are like relationships with friends, romantic
[00:30:45.830] relationships, family, you know, like just relationships in general. Right now, it's still like very me focused versus like me and my connections. So I'm like, holy shit, once we like start going into me and my connections, I feel like there's just so much more content there. And like, that's the upper divs. That's true. But you need the foundation of crystal 101 to understand that your personal
[00:31:11.610] relationship stuff. She needs to learn about the wars within myself first. Oh my god, that is hilarious. On the topic of interpersonal relationships, I think like you said, like a lot of therapy, I'm sure is focused on these things because we're like social creatures and whatnot, things that happen between us and our loved ones, like that affects us, right? In my therapy sessions, there's like a recurring cast, you know, essentially. And I've mentioned in a past episode
[00:31:38.030] that I like, never named them by name. Oh my god. Same though. But yesterday, I was like talking about this thing that happened to me recently. And I was like, oh, yeah, like this is the person who and then I like listed all the past stories I've shared about this person, so that she knows exactly who I'm talking about. Right. And then as I was doing that, I was like, am I gonna fucking do this anytime I mentioned anyone? Like I have to be like, oh, yeah, I remember this story. Remember this story?
[00:32:04.490] You're giving the whole biography. Yeah, exactly. So I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna say their name because I feel like it gets confusing. And then she was like, oh, thank god. Yes, please. Like just say their name. And I was like, oh my god, like in my head, I was like, you should have said something like I didn't know. So confusing. Like such a hassle for all of us, you know? Yeah, yeah. I don't know what it is. But I totally have that too. I'm like, if we like say the name,
[00:32:30.090] it like means something. I don't know. I know. I feel like it's, it's too real. At least for me, like mentally, it's like I want to focus on like the actions or like the things that happen and not necessarily like on this person. You know what I mean? Right. I don't want to like pass judgment or like, you know, add fall or like blame or whatever to like this person. It's more about like things that are happening between us that I want to talk about. So I think like part of the anonymity makes me feel
[00:32:59.310] like I'm not doing that. But you know, even if you name them, it's like you're still just talking about the actions or like the stories that happen between you. Like it's not like you're like talking shit with someone. It's like your therapist. Yeah, that's true. Now next thing you know, she's walking down the street, grabbing her coffee. She hears a name and she's like, oh my god, that's Jisoo's whoever, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's so funny.
[00:33:25.110] I think part of it too is I'm just like the type of person that would totally like look people up, even though I know therapists and like doctors, like they're not supposed to do that. But I just am that bitch. So she gets protection from that. Now I'm imagining we show up to our sessions with a fucking giant whiteboard and like pictures of the people in our lives, like magnetized to the board
[00:33:50.750] with like red marker lines drawn everywhere and like notes written in the corner. Oh my god. We go in and we're like, all right, here is the deal today. Giving a lesson. Dude, I love that. That would probably make it so much more fun for the therapist too, honestly. Dude, yeah, we can make like slideshows. I'll be like, all right, so this person, age, location, how I've known them, what our current
[00:34:20.650] relationship is. Next slide, like the other person, person B, like blah, blah, blah, blah. The final slide is like how person A through F are connected with me. That's gold. But honestly, I feel like in the Bay, you just never know, especially if you have someone in your community or like someone who lives in a city that might be your hometown, things like that, you just never know. Wait, that's so true.
[00:34:46.390] It's dangerous in the Bay. It's like normally what it's six degrees of separation, but I swear in the Bay, it's like three. Have you ever done remote therapy, by the way? The only time I did remote therapy was my intro call with my current therapist. So that was like really my only experience. I've had a couple of times where I was like, oh shit, like schedule wise, I feel like remote might make more
[00:35:12.450] sense. But there's just something about the magic of like in-person therapy that I like, that makes me not want to do remote. But why do you ask? I just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on like the difference. Oh. Anything you noticed or anything you feel? I think the only thing that I noticed was it felt very work meeting-y. And I also don't love phone calls and like calling in general.
[00:35:41.010] Yeah. It's not my favorite form of communication, I would say. So then I could feel myself being, you know, like hyper focusing on the clock because it's easy to like look at it on the corner of your computer screen and stuff like that. Literally after that one remote session, I was like, okay, I'm not, I'm like not fit to be like a remote client for therapy. Yeah. I think it's pretty interesting. Like my in-person sessions, my therapist is really intentional about the space,
[00:36:09.950] her office, I guess. There's always like an air purifier running. There's always like water ready for you if you need any. It's like a very curated space, I guess, you know, it's like purposely made for you to feel comfortable and hopefully relaxed. But then I feel like in remote sessions, depending on where you are, at least in my case, I feel like I've always had slight anxiety. Like, oh my God,
[00:36:38.310] what if someone like walks in on me and I'm in the middle of my session? You know, like, because usually you're taking it in maybe your room or a phone booth. So there's always like a slight worry like, oh my God, what if someone like knocks on my door and is like trying to talk to me? What if someone walks by outside and like hears me sharing my, I don't know, some vulnerable sad story or,
[00:37:02.950] you know. So I do think like in person, it's kind of nice that it's like, oh, this is like a very safe space. No one's going to walk in on us. It's like dedicated to therapy right now. So that's like a very positive thing that I've felt for myself. I like that. And I think similarly, I do feel that my therapist space is very curated and comfortable. And I think if you're someone who has difficulty having their guard up or like sharing about really personal things and stuff like that, I feel like
[00:37:32.870] in person therapy is a lot better. And the reason I say that is if I'm at home, this is like my zone, like my territory, right? I'm like still in that same mindset of I'm in my house. But then when I'm in her place, it's like the reason that I'm like doing this therapy feels a little bit more real. And it feels like I'm going in with like a mission versus if I see it as like a video call or something, I might think like, okay, this is just a part of my schedule today. Like just do this video call
[00:38:02.710] and then I can do X, Y, Z afterwards. Right. So I feel like it's a little bit harder to like immerse yourself in the moment too, along with all the like potential distractions of just like, you know, not being in like their specific office that can sort of make remote therapy less appealing for me. Yeah, very true. And I think also in person, you can see more of the full body language,
[00:38:26.050] which I don't know, hopefully is helpful for the therapist. That's true. There's two awkward things I think about in person though. So one of them was just a very specific happening. I got to therapy and then I always sit on the couch in the room that she has set up right in front of the couch is like a water carafe and some water cups. So one time I sat down and she was like, would you like
[00:38:52.230] some water? And I was like, I'm good. I just felt so like, I felt so like rude and like awkward, but I was like, no, it's fine. I'm good. But it ended up coming out just like, I'm good. Like, you know, that's so funny. And I was like, she's like, okay. I was like, oh God. Like so embarrassed internally for like a good five minutes. And then I also think ending sessions is so awkward.
[00:39:22.870] Oh, in person? Yeah. The actual ending itself is fine because my therapist will just be like, okay, well, like, you know, time's up. We'll talk more next week. And we talk briefly about like when we're meeting next. But then I have to like walk to the door to leave. And she like walks me to the door and it's like so awkward. Wait, but that's like how I leave sessions too. Like after we wrap up,
[00:39:49.650] she like walks me to the door, but you guys don't do like small talk or anything like to the door? Yeah. Well, okay. To be honest, it's like five steps. Oh, I see. I see. So it's like not enough time to small talk, but like still long enough to feel the silence. Yes. Because we'll be like, okay. And then we'll say bye. And then we'll get up and she walks me to the door. And then we say bye like two more times on the way to the door. And then again,
[00:40:17.270] and I'm like, dude, I don't know how to make leaving therapy less awkward. It's just it's so awkward in my mind. I'm like, fuck, dude. Why am I so awkward? Wait, that is so funny. I mean, I would consider myself pretty up there on the list of like awkwardness. But how we always end our sessions is like, she's like, okay, so I think we're pretty much at time. And this after like 30
[00:40:45.690] seconds of like nodding from both of us, you know, because we're both like, okay, it's probably time, but like someone needs to say it. So she says that and then she's like, when do you want to meet next? And there's like some sort of recurring schedule, but we just double check anyway. Right. Sometimes she'll be like, oh, I can't do this date because blah, blah, blah. And then I'll be like, oh, like, where are you going? And then that would be our small talk topic to the door. And she'll be like, oh, I'm doing this, blah, blah, blah. And then it always ends with like, have a nice weekend. So you're like getting up while you're talking about your next
[00:41:15.510] appointment. We double check the next appointment. Like, oh, it looks like our next session is this. And then I'll be like, oh yeah, perfect. That works. And then we both get up and then either one of us would be like, oh, what are you doing that weekend that we're skipping? Or like, you know, if there's a holiday, like, what are you doing this holiday weekend? Okay. And then a half sentence share. It's like, have fun, have nice weekend. And that's like the five steps to the door. You know what I mean? Okay. Maybe I'll give that a try next time.
[00:41:42.090] Okay. But I always feel like it's, it's like a violation if I ask her like about her life. Like, I shouldn't ask her about her personal life. So I'm just like, okay, we get up, we start walking and I'm like, okay, uh, bye. And she's like, all right, like have a good week.
[00:42:04.250] And I'm like, okay, you too. But I like open the door. I like, it's so awkward that I don't even take the last step to the door. I just lean forward and reach for the door. And I open it. You like long jump out of the door. And then I open the door and I like immediately scooch out.
[00:42:24.030] And I'm like, okay, bye. Oh my God. That is so funny. Holy fuck. Yeah. It's a real problem. Dude, that is just hilarious. Okay. I'll try the small talk thing next time. Yeah. Maybe I can ask her. I'll be like, oh, so like, what were you doing in July when we couldn't have sessions?
[00:42:51.390] Wait, that sounds weird. That sounds weird. That's like, oh, why are we so busy? You couldn't even see me. Oh God. It's just getting worse and worse. You know what would also be awkward? You know, when you part with like a friend and you're like, oh my God, like this lunch day was so fun. Like hope to see you next time. Like, can you imagine doing that with your therapist? Like, oh, this session was so insightful. Like, can't wait to see you next time.
[00:43:19.020] You're just like rating like the session. Okay. Yeah. Oh my dude. I'm just like thinking about all my exits right now. Sometimes I'll be like, oh yeah. Like, thanks. Bye. See you next time. Holy shit. Why is it so bad? Oh my God. It's okay. You're only like five sessions in, you know, like you're right. You're not homies like that yet. Yeah. You're right. Sometimes I also
[00:43:46.300] like, as we're walking to the door, I'm like, oh my God, I don't know if I should like look at her. She like kind of walks behind me a bit and I'm like, and then I like almost like, I like twitch. I'm like, look, double take to look at her or something. And when I open the door, I like turn around. I'm like, okay, bye. Actually, to be fair, I don't think I really look at my therapist when I'm
[00:44:12.260] walking out. Okay. I'm just like, okay, time's up. Like I need to get the fuck out of here. So I just like stride to the door, mini small talk and then turn to say bye and that's it. Okay. All right. Okay. So it's not all bad. Yeah. Yeah. There's a method to the badness. Yeah. I just need to make some minor changes. I'm so sorry. You had to hear how awkwardly terrible my goodbyes are.
[00:44:42.520] No, it, it takes some getting accustomed to, to like develop a rhythm. I think I totally get it. This is like my question when I was like, how do you say hi to someone on a first date? It's like, how do you say bye to your therapist? Dude. Cause also for remote sessions, you're just like, okay, bye. Close the tab. You're like, oh, true. Yeah. True. True. True. See you next time. Yeah. Close tab and you're good. There's no physical movements you need to do. There's no awkward walking. They don't need to see me get out of my seat.
[00:45:12.720] I will say though, I feel like I feel the opposite sentiment as you where sometimes I feel bad that I don't make that much small talk with my therapist. I'm like, damn, she always asks me how I'm doing, but I never ask her how she's doing. Oh my God. It's like those memes. Yeah. I know what you mean though. I guess I haven't felt that quite yet, but maybe as I get closer to my therapist, I'll have those feelings. But yeah, no, for some reason
[00:45:37.680] right now, my thoughts are just like, wow, wouldn't it be like a violation if I'm asking her about her personal life? I'm like, who am I for her to share her personal life with? You know? I think I usually feel that way, but it's like when she does drop small details about her life in our sessions, I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe I've been going to you for two years and I didn't know this until now. Like that kind of feeling, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. And then I feel
[00:46:02.240] the guilt of like, should I be asking you how your weekend is before we, before the like two seconds small talk to the door at the end? Dude. Speaking of like asking your therapist how their weekend was and stuff, how do you say hi to your therapist? Usually I'm just like, hi. And then I'm like, God, it's so hot outside. Or like there's so much traffic to, you know, like some really inane shit because I need like a filler sentence before I jump into all my traumas of the week.
[00:46:29.960] Right, right. But I also don't want to open up Pandora's box and have like a five minute small talk session at the beginning because that cuts into my, my like payment time, right? Yeah. Okay. So this is what happens to me. And you know, I'm, I'm not a big fan of small talk and I'm not good at small talk either. So I walk in and it's like, hi, hi. We like silently take our
[00:46:55.580] five steps to the couch and everything. I sit down. Why is there so much silence? I don't know. I'm so sorry. And then, you know, she's just down, she pulls out her notebook, she's getting, getting comfortable and stuff. And she's like, how's, how's your week? You know, how have you been? And I'm like, good. And then she'll be like, oh, okay, great. And then she'll be like, so what do you want to
[00:47:24.480] talk about this week? And then I'm like, um, I don't know. Well, actually that's not true. I don't say, I don't know, but I'm just kind of like, um, uh, and if I don't say something right away, she'll be like, we can talk about like these things that we talked about last time or this thing that we didn't get to. And I'll be like, okay. And then we'd like start to jump into conversation, but our hellos are also awkward, but I want, I do want to say our buys are the most awkward.
[00:47:50.040] Oh my God. This kills me. I bet there's so many, like, I want to like shower you with suggestions right now. You get literally like, oh, that's a nice notebook. And then that's like three or two of the five seconds. You know what I mean? I see. That is so funny though. I guess I need to work on, maybe I should talk to my therapist about my encounters with her. Would you name it though?
[00:48:19.340] Like, oh my God, I want to talk to you about how awkward I feel around you. Or would you be like, I have this friend? I'd probably be like, oh my God, I'm so awkward. I'm so sorry. Why do you think I'm so awkward? Why do you think our buys are so awkward? Do you, do you need me to give you some small talk? Because I can, I can try. Your therapist is going to be like, oh my God,
[00:48:47.960] I need to call my therapist. She'll be like, do you want to have a two person session with me with my therapist? It's couples therapy. Oh my God. That is so funny. One session though, and then we'll probably be right as rain. We won't have any more awkward goodbyes. That's true. And maybe this is also like just part of the process of getting to know your therapist
[00:49:16.390] because people also approach small talk differently. So yeah, maybe do that couples therapy with your therapist. Let us know how it goes. Okay. And hopefully your therapist is able to graduate to crystal 101, 102 and the upper division classes for all the juicy details of your life. Hopefully soon. I always find it really interesting talking about therapy with you though, because I feel like we have different approaches to therapy and also kind of different relationships
[00:49:46.030] with our various therapists. So hopefully this was also interesting for our listeners to hear about the different ways that your relationships with your therapists can go.
