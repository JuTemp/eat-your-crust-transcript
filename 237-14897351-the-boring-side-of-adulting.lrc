[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Jessica.
[00:00:16.640]  Welcome back, Jessica. The last episode Jessica joined us on was episode 204 Girl Talk Healthy
[00:00:23.680]  Relationships. This week we have a less exciting topic to talk about, but in Jessica's eyes I think it's very exciting.
[00:00:32.240]  This is like a roast.
[00:00:35.200]  Well no, that's why you're the perfect guess for this topic.
[00:00:38.960]  Okay, I'm honored.
[00:00:42.000]  But before we get to all of that, we do have a slang word to discuss and this one is funny because
[00:00:48.280]  Jeesoo and I use this a lot sometimes with our friends and
[00:00:53.520]  some of them don't know what it is so they'll be like, wait, what?
[00:00:57.280]  This word really had its moment maybe like a couple years ago now. Nowadays the usage has died down
[00:01:03.920]  but I still think it's a really funny word and I'm sure Jeesoo can agree.
[00:01:07.920]  So the word is
[00:01:09.680]  malding.
[00:01:11.360]  Essentially this word is a mixture of mad and balding. So you can kind of
[00:01:18.400]  guess what the definition is
[00:01:21.600]  Hopefully. Dude, I love this word. I think of the slang words that I use
[00:01:26.000]  It's one of my top five most used slang words and I feel like it's just so funny because
[00:01:31.360]  I'm sure everyone can relate to that moment where you're so angry so upset about something
[00:01:35.680]  That it makes you want to like pull your hair out and to me that's kind of like what best illustrates malding
[00:01:41.200]  That's like the vision I have in my head too. Like you're so angry. You're tugging at your hair
[00:01:45.920]  You know, you're becoming bald because of how angry you are
[00:01:49.360]  I feel like as intuitive in a sense it sounds
[00:01:54.640]  I do also feel like this word can be a little bit interesting or hard to decipher until you actually hear the words mad and bald together
[00:02:01.840]  So I can definitely think of multiple times where people are like, wait, what?
[00:02:06.160]  What did you say?
[00:02:07.280]  And then you like explain the word to them and I feel like it always makes people laugh
[00:02:10.720]  So that in a sense is also a good slang word because I think people are receptive to it
[00:02:15.280]  They're like, this is a creative word. I think it's a very easy word
[00:02:19.280]  To use I definitely heard it for the first time from you Jisoo
[00:02:22.960]  Me and my boyfriend Vince. We have just like gone and ran wild with it
[00:02:28.640]  We heard it from you the first time we try to put as many twists on it as possible
[00:02:33.680]  I think sometimes it just depends on the situation, but sometimes Vince will be like
[00:02:37.920]  I didn't go running today. He runs normally and he's like, I had a really bad run
[00:02:42.480]  And I was folding. That's like slow fat and balding
[00:02:49.680]  It's just like you just try to put as many adjectives in there
[00:02:56.080]  Like it's own format
[00:02:58.160]  Exactly
[00:02:59.440]  It's its own formula now for us. So I do really love this word
[00:03:04.480]  Oh, that's so funny
[00:03:06.400]  I feel like it's just spur of the moment
[00:03:08.400]  Whatever it is that we're doing it's there. It's there as our formula
[00:03:11.440]  Just add the old thing at the end
[00:03:12.720]  Yeah
[00:03:13.840]  Anything as many adjectives as you can combine into one just like the first letter just slap it in there
[00:03:19.680]  Oh my god, I love that dude. That's the fucking power and the magic of malding
[00:03:25.520]  It births new memes
[00:03:28.800]  I think that's so funny because it is kind of like a representation of twitch
[00:03:35.920]  Because a lot of twitch slang
[00:03:38.640]  Which you know some of these are born from malding. I think also got really big on twitch
[00:03:43.760]  And a lot of these slang words or memes or whatever they evolve and just become like more and more degenerate
[00:03:50.640]  And so I feel like yeah malding is the perfect example. It's so funny that
[00:03:55.520]  You two are just like creating different versions of malting
[00:04:00.400]  It's definitely a change of the game for us in certain situations
[00:04:05.280]  I need to keep track of like a list and just start using them. Oh my god. I thought of a funny one
[00:04:11.600]  Shalding sleepy hungry and balding
[00:04:17.040]  Wait, I feel that one on the daily like me every morning
[00:04:22.400]  I looked up malding though for our you know word origin purposes and what I found was very interesting on our favorite website
[00:04:30.880]  knowyourmeme.com
[00:04:32.720]  They said the origin is actually at least the first traceable origin is from 2011
[00:04:39.760]  In urban dictionary someone defined malding as
[00:04:43.920]  Someone who is either a mad and bald person or a person who is mad about being bald
[00:04:49.920]  So it was actually like a noun before like mald the popularized one is a verb like malding
[00:04:58.160]  I think I like the malding spin-off more in the screen capture of this original urban dictionary definition
[00:05:04.640]  The like sentence example is like you're so mald and I think it just doesn't hit
[00:05:08.960]  I'm fucking malding. It's way harder than you're so mald
[00:05:13.120]  I think also because the verb it's like anyone can use it right?
[00:05:16.800]  It's like i'm so angry that i'm pulling my hair out versus like mald feels more
[00:05:22.240]  pointed towards people who are bald which is a little more
[00:05:26.160]  niche and
[00:05:27.600]  Targeted kind of aggressive
[00:05:29.600]  Yeah, kind of mean right
[00:05:31.760]  Yeah, I definitely appreciate almost the self-differentatory usage of malding rather than the insulting version
[00:05:39.200]  Agreed. Well one thing that I think makes a lot of people mald is actually our topic today
[00:05:48.080]  Well, actually maybe only parts of our topic today make people mald
[00:05:52.080]  Our overall topic is the quote unquote boring side of adulting
[00:05:56.800]  So more of the paperwork like self-care planning being a real human kind of aspect of
[00:06:04.560]  adulthood
[00:06:05.360]  I feel like this one is interesting too because being an adult is something you fantasize about when you're young
[00:06:11.200]  But I feel like the parts and pieces that you fantasize about are not the administrative aspects of it
[00:06:16.880]  I was more thinking of myself in like a pantsuit and like high heels
[00:06:21.040]  Walking to work with like a briefcase in my hand
[00:06:23.680]  But I was not envisioning myself cleaning the house or doing taxes and things like that
[00:06:28.880]  So it is kind of interesting to get the rest into this position as an adult where you're like, oh, shit
[00:06:34.400]  There's so many different things that I have to like maintain in life and so many things that I have to plan for etc
[00:06:40.640]  So I am very excited to talk to you guys about going through that aspect of adulthood
[00:06:46.240]  So what do you think is your like least favorite adulting task?
[00:06:51.120]  I think back when I had a car, I would say that it was probably car stuff
[00:06:57.280]  Going to get your oil changed or rotate your tires, which in the
[00:07:03.440]  Four years that I drove my car. I didn't do once so that was probably bad
[00:07:10.960]  And I think just doing car stuff is also very intimidating for like a woman
[00:07:16.880]  And making sure that I'm not getting scammed but then also at the same time, you know, they're telling you
[00:07:22.160]  Oh, you need to get this change. It looks like it needs to be changed. So I'm like, well damn like maybe I should pay for it then
[00:07:29.600]  Yeah, I feel like car stuff for me was probably my least favorite part
[00:07:34.320]  And now that I don't have a car
[00:07:36.720]  That's gone. So thank god
[00:07:38.640]  But I think after that surprisingly enough although I do love doing my taxes
[00:07:42.880]  I actually really don't enjoy doing other finance related
[00:07:47.600]  For example my 401k that I had with my previous company
[00:07:51.520]  It was through vanguard and then through my current company. My 401k now is through fidelity
[00:07:58.560]  And so I had set up this whole like rollover
[00:08:02.080]  Roth IRA account for me to like transfer all of my funds that were in vanguard to fidelity
[00:08:07.520]  And it's been two years and I haven't done it. So
[00:08:09.680]  Oh my god, there's that
[00:08:11.440]  Dude, wait, I have the same thing except the opposite of you like fidelity to vanguard
[00:08:16.800]  And it's been like three years and I still haven't I put it on my to-do list in the beginning of every year
[00:08:23.520]  Like don't forget to do the rollover this year. And then I always forget
[00:08:28.240]  And it's gone so bad that I have to pay like a fee on it now like a fee
[00:08:32.880]  Yeah, because it's like you're not with that company anymore. So you have to pay like a small fee to keep that account alive
[00:08:39.600]  Yeah, and I was like, oh shoot. I really need to like roll this over soon
[00:08:43.440]  I actually haven't even like gone into vanguard and looked at it
[00:08:48.320]  Since setting that up. So I don't even I'm probably paying a fee
[00:08:51.360]  But I just I haven't even gone and looked at it. So
[00:08:55.600]  I think the only thing I went to look at was if I have to pay a fee to my new fidelity account
[00:09:01.440]  If I don't have any money in there like it's just literally a balance of zeros
[00:09:05.360]  I'm like, do I need to pay a fee for this and that was a no. So then I think after I saw that I was like, okay
[00:09:10.400]  That's fine. I'll just deal with it later
[00:09:14.640]  I think like the fee is not too bad
[00:09:16.800]  But it's just the fact that you're paying the fee out of your account. You're like, oh shoot
[00:09:20.400]  Like I really need to move this to the non-fee account now
[00:09:24.640]  I feel like along those lines though. I can totally relate to
[00:09:28.640]  I think even stuff like insurance
[00:09:31.120]  I just hate dealing with and I kind of have a feeling that it's like stuff
[00:09:35.120]  That's set up through your work. Maybe it's just inconvenient sometimes or less intuitive
[00:09:40.560]  And I hate having to go in and like pick my insurance every year
[00:09:45.520]  I don't want to do the research
[00:09:46.880]  Surely there's one optimal decision that someone can make for me
[00:09:50.000]  Like why do I have to custom fit this to my own life?
[00:09:54.320]  Yeah, I feel like car stuff always just like sneaks up onto you late last year
[00:09:59.680]  I had my registration sticker arrive in the mail and I was like, oh, I better put this on soon
[00:10:05.840]  But I double checked. I was like, oh, I don't need to put it on till the end of the month
[00:10:08.880]  So I just like kept putting it off, you know
[00:10:11.840]  And it's like the simplest task. I just had to peel the sticker off
[00:10:15.920]  Stick it on and like put the paper into my car
[00:10:18.880]  But I was just like no like I'll have to wipe it and everything
[00:10:22.640]  I'll do it when I'm more prepared. Dude. I actually don't even wipe mine
[00:10:26.240]  I just like put it on and you know how you can have like a little border around your license plate
[00:10:31.200]  Usually I think normal people would take it off and then put their sticker on and then put the border back on
[00:10:36.080]  I honestly have just been putting it over my border for the last couple years
[00:10:40.160]  Wait, I didn't know people wiped it
[00:10:43.040]  Never wiped it in my life
[00:10:44.640]  I think it's just like it helps of it to get some of the dust off so it'll stick better
[00:10:49.360]  So I've actually also learned a good tip is
[00:10:52.560]  You score it like you put it on and then you use a
[00:10:56.320]  Exacto knife and kind of cut it in half or something just so people can't steal it
[00:11:01.360]  But low-key people could just steal your whole license plate. So like oh, you know
[00:11:05.920]  True. Yeah, my old car was from 1999
[00:11:09.760]  So I'm pretty sure the stickers was just like 20
[00:11:15.040]  22 23 years of just
[00:11:18.000]  sticker after sticker and it was like this inch lick I swear so
[00:11:22.480]  I don't think
[00:11:24.080]  Anybody before me who had that car
[00:11:28.240]  To do anything about it
[00:11:29.520]  I wonder if people actually peel off their previous year sticker. I feel like that's so much work
[00:11:34.800]  I feel like it's kind of hard to take off now. Yeah, it feels like it's so like sticky
[00:11:39.200]  Because I'm just thinking like yeah
[00:11:40.560]  What if you have an old car like your old car and you just have like this one inch thick pad of stickers, you know
[00:11:47.600]  Maybe it's actually easier to take off at that point
[00:11:49.680]  Oh, instead of having to like you know so thin you like dig your nail and you just like just comes off as a chunk
[00:11:55.680]  Yeah, car stuff is annoying
[00:11:57.680]  And I feel like home stuff has also seemed slightly annoying to me after james and I bought our house
[00:12:04.640]  Because before I felt like we were always living in an apartment
[00:12:08.160]  So the only things that I dreamed of was like, oh, it would be so nice to have
[00:12:12.240]  A place with a garden and a place where I don't have to park in like this huge parking garage
[00:12:17.680]  All these things that I considered benefits
[00:12:20.480]  But when it comes to actually owning a home
[00:12:22.720]  I feel like the thing that I noticed on the daily is like, oh, I need to fix this part of the house
[00:12:26.800]  And I need to like add this and hopefully one day we can remodel and do this
[00:12:30.000]  So it's just like this long laundry list that I feel like never gets shorter and always only gets longer
[00:12:35.280]  So home maintenance stuff. I think has been a huge
[00:12:38.960]  Part of our like personal to-do list for us. That's funny that you mentioned the garden because
[00:12:45.360]  I feel like you and james are always complaining about your garden area now
[00:12:51.440]  Dude, yeah
[00:12:52.000]  And sometimes when we move stuff and like a wall gets scuffed or something like I'm always like, oh, fuck
[00:12:56.000]  We need to like go and paint that and there's just so many things that I have to think about
[00:13:00.400]  It's now that we don't have an apartment manager or someone who does all the thinking for us
[00:13:06.720]  That's true. You don't have somebody to like call or be like, this is your responsibility
[00:13:13.280]  I'm like, oh fuck. This is our responsibility
[00:13:17.760]  And honestly stuff like painting the walls or dealing with bits and pieces here and there inside or
[00:13:24.160]  Outside the home including the garden. I feel like it's somewhat intuitive
[00:13:27.520]  Like obviously when we bought this house, I was like, okay
[00:13:30.400]  Yeah, this like we're gonna have to do something about this garden
[00:13:33.440]  But the crazy thing is I feel like there's all these miscellaneous items that I honestly never would have thought of
[00:13:38.880]  For example, we were talking to one of our parents and their like back fence fell down
[00:13:44.560]  So then they were telling us like, oh, yeah
[00:13:46.640]  You have to go and like talk to that neighbor and see
[00:13:49.280]  Which plot of land the fence stakes are in and then that's how you see who actually owns that fence
[00:13:56.000]  So sometimes it's like, oh half the fence like the left side of the fence is ours
[00:14:00.640]  And then the right side of the fence is theirs
[00:14:02.560]  So then if the left side falls we do it if the right side falls they do it or other times
[00:14:07.200]  It's stake by stake. So you kind of alternate or some shit
[00:14:10.640]  And I was sitting there listening to this and I was like, if you didn't tell me
[00:14:14.480]  I never would have even thought about our fence
[00:14:16.640]  You know, because it's like in the back of our backyard
[00:14:19.520]  Yeah, you're like, please don't fall down in the next like 50 years
[00:14:24.640]  I was like, we had a fence that sounds like a nightmare
[00:14:27.360]  Oh, that's true because you also have to talk to your neighbors about if say like the whole fence side is on your land
[00:14:33.920]  You still need to talk to them. Hey, is it okay if I do this design?
[00:14:37.600]  Loki, right? It's like doesn't match the neighborhood. Like can I just do this?
[00:14:41.600]  I imagine if say you're like, all right, fuck it. I'm just gonna get like some ugly ass like metal
[00:14:47.360]  You know weave fence and then the neighbor's like, yo, what the fuck is that?
[00:14:52.160]  Exactly
[00:14:53.120]  There's like, I don't know all these crazy rules that I feel like no one knows about except the people on next door
[00:14:59.040]  Who somehow know like every law
[00:15:01.440]  But it's like if your neighbor's tree is in your backyard, then legally you're allowed to snip it down
[00:15:07.200]  But obviously you can't go and take out the roots or some shit because the tree is still theirs
[00:15:11.760]  And you can legally take the fruit on your side, etc.
[00:15:14.480]  Etc. Etc. So there's all these like little nuances where I'm just like
[00:15:17.840]  I can't believe there's a law for this or like I can't believe there's actual guidance for this
[00:15:22.880]  Then when our neighbors in my parents house, there was like a time period where a lot of our neighbors were
[00:15:30.240]  Trying to
[00:15:31.680]  build a second floor or like even a third floor and just like expand their house
[00:15:36.240]  And I think there's laws around if you build another floor or if you expand upwards
[00:15:41.040]  Then there's laws about like, oh your window can't be facing a certain way where it's like you can see into somebody else's yard
[00:15:48.400]  So I remember some people would come around like some neighbors would like come around and be like
[00:15:52.880]  Hey, we're thinking of doing this. These are some of the things we're
[00:15:57.120]  Wanting to upgrade and to build in our home
[00:16:00.560]  And I think you just need neighbors approvals and stuff like that
[00:16:03.840]  And I think you as a neighbor and homeowner also have a lot of
[00:16:07.520]  I guess like rights to like what your neighbor can or cannot do
[00:16:11.600]  And if they want to expand or upgrade or like do whatever to their house too. So
[00:16:15.760]  Yeah, I can see that being
[00:16:18.640]  Very frustrating sometimes wait that makes so much sense because actually I can't see into my neighbor's backyard from my second floor
[00:16:27.280]  It's all like you've been trying
[00:16:30.160]  Like I'm unable to do I think I think that's like one time
[00:16:34.000]  They were being loud. So I like ran to the other side of the house. I was like, oh, maybe I can check out
[00:16:38.400]  What's happening in the backyard? Like why is it so loud and I was like, I can't see shit, dude
[00:16:45.840]  House stuff is crazy, right dude. Yeah
[00:16:48.880]  And property taxes are crazy. Oh my god
[00:16:51.600]  Oh god
[00:16:52.640]  And I feel like it's harder to half-ass stuff once you own a home too because like in a rental, you know
[00:16:58.480]  You're like, okay, whatever like I'll just haphazardly like pay over this part that I stuck a nail in
[00:17:04.080]  But when it's like your own home, you're like, oh, I want to make sure it's gonna like last long
[00:17:08.800]  I'm doing it properly. Yeah, and I feel like there's also funny shit that comes with like owning a house with someone
[00:17:15.440]  When I was growing up
[00:17:16.480]  I feel like once every three months or something my parents would suddenly get inspiration at like 11 p.m
[00:17:22.960]  And then we would like rearrange certain rooms and it would be like a whole project and I would love
[00:17:27.360]  Wait, I remember that right like every time I came over your room would be you and a have a different room
[00:17:33.600]  And then be everything all the furniture in said room was different. That's so fun. It's like wait, what?
[00:17:39.600]  I'm like just like quarterly scramble
[00:17:41.760]  Yeah, you're like, all right, bet which which room is hers this time
[00:17:46.000]  I know
[00:17:47.680]  But since that was so normal to me in my childhood and actually something that I would look forward to
[00:17:52.400]  I have that urge all the time here. I'm like, oh my god
[00:17:55.120]  Like James we should swap our bedroom and our office for the summer because this room gets more sunlight and james is like
[00:18:02.560]  No
[00:18:03.600]  I'm gonna throw out my back and I'm like, I guess but wouldn't it be so nice to be in the sunny room?
[00:18:09.600]  Because he and his family come from the philosophy of like, oh, we set it up once
[00:18:13.840]  It's like super nice and then done and done final
[00:18:16.960]  But yeah, I'm always like, oh, let's paint this wall. Like let's do this. Let's move that and james is like, please
[00:18:21.600]  So I feel like even the homeowner philosophy or maybe just like the interior design philosophy is inherently different for us
[00:18:29.360]  Oh my god, that's so funny
[00:18:30.960]  I can kind of feel that even without like being a homeowner
[00:18:34.080]  But I feel like sometimes there was a period of time in our old studio
[00:18:38.400]  Our old studio was so tiny. It was like our bed was up against the back of our couch
[00:18:44.240]  That was up against the coffee table that was like up against the tv
[00:18:47.120]  So it was like tiny and then there's obviously no other way that we can rearrange furniture
[00:18:52.640]  But we were there for two years and by the end of it
[00:18:55.680]  We started sleeping with our head
[00:18:58.880]  Towards the foot of the bed
[00:19:01.200]  You know, oh like you swapped the ends of your
[00:19:04.480]  No, we didn't swap anything. We just started like instead of sleeping with our head to like the headboard
[00:19:09.840]  Like a normal person. We just turned it around like we just slept with our head to the foot of the bed
[00:19:15.360]  So you didn't even you didn't even rotate the bed
[00:19:18.400]  Your feet were just at the headboard
[00:19:20.400]  Yeah
[00:19:21.680]  Because we were like there's no we can't physically move anything
[00:19:25.680]  But we're so desperate for that change and to like feel like something new and exciting is happening
[00:19:32.560]  So we're like, okay. We're not gonna sleep the other way around
[00:19:36.960]  Yeah, and then I think for a bit we were sleeping on the ground
[00:19:41.520]  Just like we need to switch it up. The only thing you could rearrange is your bodies
[00:19:47.040]  Exactly
[00:19:48.960]  I will admit I do rearrange my room a lot too. Like every couple years. I'll rearrange it a bit
[00:19:55.440]  It's just it's fun
[00:19:56.960]  Okay, but what I've learned is the ultimate move is to put wheels on your furniture
[00:20:01.200]  That like any furniture that can have wheels you should put wheels on them
[00:20:05.040]  So my desk you can put heavy-duty wheels on them
[00:20:08.320]  So I did and so it's a lot easier to rearrange my room now. Wait, that's genius. Yeah
[00:20:13.280]  I'm about to move. So oh, yeah, I'm actually gonna start
[00:20:16.960]  I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that
[00:20:19.280]  I think a lot of like standing desks nowadays have like the option to add wheels. So pretty nice
[00:20:25.600]  So I have something that's not necessarily home or apartment related
[00:20:30.320]  But I do want to ask you guys this because I feel like there's
[00:20:33.520]  In my mind two archetypes of people every year with your
[00:20:37.840]  health insurance vision insurance
[00:20:39.840]  dental insurance
[00:20:40.720]  I feel like you get like a reset of like, okay
[00:20:42.960]  This year you can go get your cleaning done twice and get your vision checked, etc
[00:20:46.800]  Etc. Are you guys more the type to go and do all your appointments in January?
[00:20:52.240]  Aka like the moment you can do it or are you the type to go in December aka like the last possible moment you can use up your benefits
[00:21:00.400]  Oh, I think this depends
[00:21:02.880]  Because some of these benefits once you get them rolling like you don't have to worry as much. So for example like
[00:21:09.920]  Dentist I just make my next appointment every time that I go
[00:21:13.920]  But when I finally got off my parents insurance, I had to basically like re-enroll myself in a lot of these things, right?
[00:21:20.880]  So I definitely put it off. I think that year I didn't do my dentist stuff till like the end of the year
[00:21:29.040]  And then I was like, okay. Well at least now that it's done
[00:21:31.920]  They'll just make me make the next appointment every time
[00:21:35.040]  But my optometry appointment was literally the last possible day of December
[00:21:40.560]  Like maybe mid-december before holidays
[00:21:43.680]  And I think it's vision like they make you wait the full 12 months before you can make your next appointment
[00:21:50.720]  So now I'm just stuck with a december like end of year
[00:21:54.640]  time for my like eye doctor appointment and I'm like wait, this is lucky a terrible time
[00:21:59.520]  Like what if I'm traveling then I would just miss the whole year
[00:22:03.120]  Right and I feel like always in december the like booking and the lines of any sort of appointment
[00:22:09.120]  Related to insurance is just so bad. I'll have to double check like maybe I can do it earlier
[00:22:15.120]  But I know on my old insurance provision. I had to wait like the full 12 months
[00:22:20.480]  That does sound familiar to me too
[00:22:23.920]  But it's actually tragic to be stuck with that kind of timeline
[00:22:28.240]  How about you Jessica? Are you leaning more toward January appointments or december appointments?
[00:22:33.760]  I think I'm pretty similar to crystal where I kind of have a rhythm now
[00:22:39.040]  Like once you kind of said it you just stick with your rhythm, but I think mine's a little bit more ideal
[00:22:46.080]  Not during all the jealous
[00:22:49.040]  Okay with like dental stuff, I feel like they're a little less strict
[00:22:54.400]  There has to be six months between your appointments
[00:22:57.120]  But then if you like stretch it out a bit longer
[00:23:00.400]  Like if you do it in like january, then I feel like you can switch up your rhythm very easily
[00:23:05.120]  So my dental appointments right now are
[00:23:08.720]  Typically, I think I had one in like february and then the next one is in like july or august or whatever it is
[00:23:15.280]  My optometrist because now for the last couple of years
[00:23:18.480]  I've been wearing contacts like monthly contacts and so I need that
[00:23:24.080]  Coming up like I need to order my new year or else
[00:23:26.560]  I just won't have contacts because they're monthly
[00:23:28.880]  So it's like very strict like 12 months and I it's like done like I don't have any more
[00:23:33.520]  So with that, I'm usually pretty on top of it. That's around like
[00:23:37.840]  March april ish. That's a way better time than mine
[00:23:42.240]  I agree. I highly recommend
[00:23:45.360]  Wait, that's crazy monthly contacts. Okay. Also a funny story about contacts is
[00:23:51.440]  I tried contacts for the first time a year ago now and I ordered with them
[00:23:57.440]  I doctor. I was like, okay, I'll get a couple boxes
[00:23:59.600]  But the thing is I don't wear glasses and or contacts every day
[00:24:03.920]  So I bought like 90 days worth of contacts and I did not finish them in a year
[00:24:09.120]  I didn't even finish a box
[00:24:12.320]  Wait, did you buy dailies? Yeah, dailies. Okay. So the first time I had contacts that year
[00:24:18.720]  I bought six months worth of dailies. That was when I was on dailies and I think it took me
[00:24:25.280]  A little over a year to like finish using all of them
[00:24:28.800]  But they they don't expire for like five or six years or something like that. They last a really long time
[00:24:33.520]  But then after I moved to New York, I started
[00:24:37.360]  Wearing contacts a lot more frequently
[00:24:40.240]  And also that time it was like COVID and I was like wearing my mask on the train
[00:24:44.480]  Just wearing glasses when you're out and about in the city is just the worst
[00:24:48.320]  So I started wearing contacts very frequently and that's when I switched to the monthly
[00:24:52.000]  So now I'm on the schedule this time when I went to my eye doctor. I was like, oh
[00:24:56.640]  I'll just get one box of contacts. They're like, are you sure? That's only 45 days
[00:25:00.400]  There's like a whole year ahead of you. I was like, no, trust me. Like that's fine
[00:25:03.760]  I hear like my vision is decently bad. So then I definitely like rely heavily on my contacts and I hate wearing glasses
[00:25:13.520]  outside
[00:25:14.400]  So if I don't have contacts, I'm like fucked
[00:25:17.200]  But the crazy part is I think this happened more so after James and I moved here
[00:25:23.760]  We just haven't found doctors and like dentists and like, you know
[00:25:27.840]  Vision offices that we like really love because I'm kind of like, oh
[00:25:30.720]  I'm trying to find someone who's like a lifelong doctor, right?
[00:25:33.920]  So then we're kind of shopping around which I think one makes it easy to kind of miss like a normal cadence of appointments
[00:25:41.040]  To because I'm missing the cadence. I feel like I'm always like, oh my god, my prescription expired
[00:25:46.240]  I have like two weeks of contacts left. I need to go and like get something
[00:25:50.080]  This happened to me maybe like a month ago
[00:25:52.560]  And I was like freaking out. I was like, I don't have any more contacts left
[00:25:55.600]  I need a book of vision exam ASAP but the next time that I can like go in for it is in two weeks, etc
[00:26:02.080]  So then I went on my website that I used to buy contact lenses
[00:26:07.360]  I was like, I wonder if this will go through so I ordered it off my old prescription and then it actually went through
[00:26:12.640]  Even though it was expired. Isn't that crazy? I would never recommend this obviously my eye doctor just hands me a box in the office
[00:26:20.080]  They don't always have it ready. Oh, that's true. Yeah, I think they have to like order it
[00:26:25.120]  They were like, oh, okay. Your prescription is like pretty basic. So we have some boxes here
[00:26:30.400]  And they just give it to me. I mean, I guess if you're just getting one box
[00:26:34.400]  You have that too. That too. They're like, oh, you'll need one box like, okay
[00:26:38.960]  Open store. They're like, we have 45
[00:26:42.480]  contact lenses here
[00:26:44.880]  But that's such a good point. I feel like finding a new
[00:26:48.720]  doctor for anything
[00:26:50.800]  Is super annoying. I guess I'm always like, what do I look for?
[00:26:55.840]  Like my dentist is a family friend. So I just stick to that
[00:26:59.440]  And then for eye doctor though, I just stuck with what my
[00:27:04.000]  Parents had originally found me but now I'm kind of like, oh shoot. It's a little far from home
[00:27:08.000]  Like maybe I should find a new one
[00:27:09.680]  But like what do I even look for? Like how do I know if they're good?
[00:27:12.800]  You know in my journey of trying to find the one
[00:27:16.960]  Us in like the one dentist that I know and trust etc etc for all of my doctor needs
[00:27:22.640]  I always go back to what Jessica was saying earlier about like going to get your car stuff done
[00:27:27.520]  I'm always like, are you scamming me?
[00:27:30.000]  I know they're not for the most part. Everyone is very like honest and whatnot
[00:27:34.000]  but I think certain
[00:27:35.760]  People push you more to like get all this other stuff done
[00:27:38.800]  Which is like incremental costs versus other people are more
[00:27:41.840]  Direct and like straightforward and like are better at recommending stuff that you might want and need a little bit more
[00:27:48.080]  So then doing that evaluation anytime I go to any sort of appointment just makes it so much more tiring than like
[00:27:53.840]  Popping it in out and just being okay with it. I'm always like, I feel like I could find better
[00:27:58.080]  And it's like the toxic cycle of where is the better person? But oh my god. Yeah
[00:28:03.360]  I mean like even with finding a primary physician
[00:28:07.360]  I think in new york, I was so daunted by that task that I just was like fuck it
[00:28:12.560]  I'm just gonna walk into whichever like I don't have a set person who knows my history. I just like go use whoever
[00:28:19.680]  But I was like, okay, maybe long term. This is not that great
[00:28:23.040]  Wait in new york, did you ever use zock dog?
[00:28:26.240]  No, okay to be honest what I ended up doing was I think I met my deductible through other things
[00:28:32.640]  Like physical therapy or like chiropractor stuff because I met my deductible. I was like, okay
[00:28:39.360]  Who cares? I'll just go into urgent care. It's fully covered now anyway
[00:28:46.880]  Oh my god, that's hilarious
[00:28:49.840]  Well urgent care can't do like physicals and stuff right? Yeah, I never did a physical
[00:28:54.880]  Just like if you needed stuff. Yeah, I was like, oh, I'm sick. I'll just go to urgent care
[00:28:58.800]  Oh my god, I went to urgent care a couple weeks
[00:29:02.560]  Like maybe a month ago because I was having this leg pain
[00:29:05.920]  That ended up being like a nerve issue, but I went and I just got the bill like yesterday
[00:29:11.920]  It's like $150. I was like, oh it's like not the worst
[00:29:16.080]  It's not the worst but still feels like considering like what I did not get out of that appointment
[00:29:21.840]  It feels bad
[00:29:23.680]  And I definitely did not mean my deductible
[00:29:25.680]  It was very satisfying when I checked my deductible. I was like, oh, I met it. I go into urgent care
[00:29:30.800]  I get the bill later fully covered
[00:29:34.560]  You like walk in like you own the place
[00:29:38.000]  Because otherwise it's like wow, I would have paid a couple hundred to get this cough checked out, right?
[00:29:44.560]  True. So I got by that way, but now that I'm in the bay
[00:29:48.480]  I'm like, okay, like I asked my parents what doctors they used
[00:29:52.400]  Which hospital that they are patients at so then I just like joined that network and I was like, okay
[00:29:57.840]  I guess I'll trust whatever my parents are using
[00:30:00.480]  It is like truly hard to find the right doctor though because I feel like on Yelp or Jessica
[00:30:05.520]  You mentioned Zock doc, which I think is something similar to that, right? Like they have reviews and stuff
[00:30:10.160]  Yeah, it's like so there's reviews on Zock doc
[00:30:13.920]  I never actually read any of the reviews. I just like look at the rating and if it's really low then I
[00:30:19.920]  don't even look at it
[00:30:22.320]  But Zock doc is I think it might only be in New York
[00:30:25.920]  I think I tried using it once in California and it there was like nothing came up
[00:30:30.720]  It's probably regional but it's basically like an appointment scheduler for all sorts of health related things
[00:30:37.920]  So I book my dentist my automatrists my annual physical and you can even do if you want to go get like a derm appointment
[00:30:44.720]  Or like obgi an appointment like all health related things
[00:30:48.880]  You can get through Zock doc even like p2 and so I used Zock doc initially to like find people
[00:30:56.160]  Some of them have worked out like I really like my dentist
[00:30:58.560]  So I always I keep going to her my automatrists. I like shopped around a little bit
[00:31:03.360]  But my primary I've gone to like a couple times now too. So
[00:31:07.840]  Yeah, I feel like it's a good starting out place or if it's just like for example
[00:31:12.560]  I don't go to the dermatologist very often
[00:31:16.160]  But if I wanted to then I would go out there and look at it. Yeah, this has not been an ad for
[00:31:22.800]  I mean that sounds really useful
[00:31:24.560]  I have like a built-in tool kind of similar to that in my like health
[00:31:29.440]  Well, I don't even know what this is like some sort of health portal
[00:31:33.040]  But the thing is there's no reviews
[00:31:35.040]  It's just like a blank and I'm like this isn't helping me at all
[00:31:38.160]  The reviews get kind of
[00:31:39.840]  So I feel like it's always five stars like everyone on yelp who's any sort of doctor or dentist
[00:31:46.720]  It's all five stars and then you read the reviews and it's like, oh my god
[00:31:50.320]  I've been going to this person for the last like 40 years. I love this guy and then there's like a one-star review
[00:31:56.480]  That's like I'm literally blind because of this person like blah blah and I'm like, okay, which one is it?
[00:32:03.520]  Which one do I try that's true. I've definitely seen that too. It's like there's no in between
[00:32:07.840]  It's just like this is the best or this is literally the worst. Yeah
[00:32:12.880]  I mean, is there any criteria though that you even look for specifically?
[00:32:18.640]  Because I'm thinking about it and I I like don't even have criteria
[00:32:22.000]  I'm like, I hope they're nice and they can do their job
[00:32:24.720]  But then I realize that my parents actually have some criteria
[00:32:27.680]  Like to them they would prefer if this person can speak some chinese so, you know, they can like communicate better
[00:32:34.000]  I don't know sometimes like when they choose their primary physician. They look at their like
[00:32:38.480]  School history. Yeah credentials and I'm like, dude, doesn't really matter like they're all doctors anyway
[00:32:44.080]  Dude, I kind of look at that sometimes the school that they came out of
[00:32:48.000]  I don't know why but it's because there's nothing else to go off of so I was like, I guess I might as well look at this
[00:32:53.600]  They should make like hinge profiles. Oh my god are dentists wait. You're so right
[00:32:58.320]  Like they need to have some sort of get to know me
[00:33:01.520]  You're right. Yeah, true like I'm outgoing and talkative and you're like, okay. No, I prefer silence in my mind
[00:33:08.400]  What is my bedside manner?
[00:33:12.640]  My favorite type of patient is
[00:33:16.160]  Like you should match with me if oh my god
[00:33:20.800]  I don't know if I I think the only criteria I have is I think I try to see
[00:33:26.160]  Women doctors and like dentists or whoever as much as possible
[00:33:31.040]  Usually I'm talk talk. I'll like filter out guys
[00:33:34.400]  Because they allow you to do that. So I'm like, all right might as well
[00:33:38.400]  Yeah
[00:33:39.440]  I feel like that's really the only criteria I have. Oh, I guess for my primary
[00:33:45.360]  Don't come for me, but I don't usually go for
[00:33:49.120]  RNs like
[00:33:50.960]  nurses or
[00:33:52.960]  Um, like nps. Yeah, I'm thinking about nps because they're the ones who can actually prescribe
[00:33:58.960]  Do you skip deos? Depends on the rating
[00:34:02.480]  Wait, what are deos again?
[00:34:04.480]  They are doctors, but they come from a different program than mds
[00:34:09.200]  Like they don't have an md degree. They have like a do degree and I think they've learned slightly
[00:34:14.160]  slightly different things
[00:34:15.520]  But they still go through like residency and like like all the training and stuff like that
[00:34:19.600]  And yeah, they still have their same specialties. I believe but they're just like not an md
[00:34:24.480]  Yeah, I've had deodorant and I really like them
[00:34:27.760]  So I feel like I'm not
[00:34:29.360]  persistent against deos
[00:34:33.600]  So a boils down to the rating
[00:34:36.560]  And the bedside manner. Yeah
[00:34:38.880]  Yeah, they really should have some sort of like bedside manner description dude. They should that would be so helpful
[00:34:45.600]  And I feel like the vibe of the like office matters too when you go to the dentist
[00:34:49.680]  You're like also seeing the hygienist and whatever
[00:34:52.480]  But it is kind of funny because James and I just started going to this new dental office
[00:34:57.440]  And they're like nice and whatnot and it was just like a normal experience
[00:35:01.600]  But then I was on instagram the other day and then their instagram account popped up and they post a lot on instagram
[00:35:07.760]  And I was like, I don't know if this is like a pro or a con for me personally. I'm like
[00:35:12.880]  Why you guys have social media?
[00:35:14.960]  Oh, yeah
[00:35:18.720]  Yeah, I wouldn't know how to react either
[00:35:22.160]  I feel like are you cleaning teeth or posting on instagram
[00:35:26.560]  Yeah, and I'm like, I feel like I know too much about these two people now
[00:35:29.920]  Like I feel like a creep
[00:35:31.920]  Well, we talk a lot about the things that we don't really like doing
[00:35:36.320]  Is there anything that surprised you that you actually do like doing?
[00:35:40.320]  So I do like doing my taxes
[00:35:42.800]  Dude, that's crazy
[00:35:45.520]  Never before uttered sentences
[00:35:50.320]  But okay, I think the reason why I like doing them is because so far
[00:35:56.000]  I have not
[00:35:57.360]  Needed to like I have not made enough money to have to actually pay
[00:36:02.000]  Taxes after I do my returns. Okay, so it's like associated with the reward, you know
[00:36:07.520]  I'm like, holy shit. I'm about to be paid like another half of a paycheck or something
[00:36:12.560]  Like hopefully
[00:36:13.840]  You know, that's a lot of sense
[00:36:15.360]  So I'm very excited to get that
[00:36:19.040]  At the end of me doing this
[00:36:20.960]  So I feel like that's a big part of it and then second to it's
[00:36:25.680]  I mean, I've heard a lot of bad things about turbo tax, but so far
[00:36:28.400]  I've been using turbo tax and it's like fine
[00:36:31.200]  It is quite straightforward
[00:36:34.160]  And so as soon as I get my w2
[00:36:36.800]  I just upload that shit and then it like
[00:36:39.120]  You know parses everything and then like plugs and chug
[00:36:41.600]  I just like go and like click these buttons and then I get money
[00:36:45.600]  Oh hell yeah
[00:36:48.000]  Let me do this
[00:36:49.440]  Okay, and I'll be paid by the end. So this is probably not a universal experience for sure
[00:36:55.920]  What I was saying earlier about something that I don't like doing is like dealing with other financial things
[00:37:01.120]  Because of my lack of dealing with other financial things. I also just like have no money
[00:37:06.160]  And so there's nothing for me to report on my taxes because I have no gains
[00:37:12.720]  I'm like the simplest most basic version of turbo tax
[00:37:17.200]  Because I don't have jack shit you're like all losses this year and they're like, okay, you could have some money back then
[00:37:22.880]  They're like, did you receive a 1099 blah blah blah blah blah? I'm like no no no
[00:37:28.080]  Didn't get anything did not buy or sell did not do anything just sitting there
[00:37:33.120]  I have nothing and the most that I do is like I have an hsa have my 401k stuff like my regular investment things
[00:37:39.920]  I don't pull from it. I don't do anything with it. It's just there
[00:37:43.200]  And so it's not that complicated for me
[00:37:46.480]  So I just like plug and chug the numbers and then and then I get my actual returns. So
[00:37:51.920]  Yay
[00:37:52.880]  Okay, this is understandable now at first I was like damn Jessica likes doing taxes. What?
[00:37:59.760]  That's yeah, okay. I feel like growing up. I've always liked paperwork, which is also a controversial statement, but
[00:38:07.040]  I
[00:38:08.480]  Do I do really like doing paperwork
[00:38:10.480]  So it's like things that involved some sort of paperwork or like application type of thing
[00:38:18.080]  Or like setting up an appointment. So like also recently I had to renew my passport, which I was extremely excited to do
[00:38:26.960]  My jaw is on the ground
[00:38:30.240]  I was with you until the tax part. Okay, I understand there's like a prize at the end
[00:38:33.920]  There's like a pot of gold the passport appointment thing is truly like I'm so shocked right now
[00:38:39.440]  Wait, I'm shulking
[00:38:42.880]  Shocked and balding
[00:38:48.480]  Wait, it's so fun though like
[00:38:50.480]  The the paperwork is not even that long and then I just downloaded it and I just like
[00:38:55.760]  Filled it out printed it out and then it's also like an excuse for me to like
[00:39:00.480]  Run errands, which I love running errands
[00:39:03.360]  I was like, oh like let me take my little folder with like my important paperwork and my important little passport to the
[00:39:09.920]  Post office and like I mail it and I feel so like
[00:39:13.360]  You know big girl adult like accomplishing and being productive those types of like life admin things give me
[00:39:20.160]  supreme satisfaction
[00:39:22.560]  Yeah
[00:39:23.440]  Wait, I feel like passports not bad. I just like sign a couple papers and mail it in right?
[00:39:29.200]  Yeah, you just have to do it fairly early on like before you have a trip. So you don't like risk it taking forever
[00:39:35.200]  Yeah, jesus. What was your bad experience with the passport? You must share now
[00:39:40.560]  Okay, I have to say I have also never had like a truly negative experience with my passport
[00:39:45.920]  But I feel like my beef with paperwork and especially very like official stuff
[00:39:50.880]  This includes taxes too
[00:39:52.400]  It's like I don't like the possibility that I'm like filling out something willy-nilly and then it might be wrong
[00:39:58.640]  Or something. You know how when you do
[00:40:01.440]  Taxes and at the end it's like oh your risk of getting audited is oh my god
[00:40:06.160]  Which I honestly feel like is just like a fucking static photo like I feel like they're not running any calculations
[00:40:11.040]  It's just like they tell everyone that and then they're like, oh, but do you want audit defense for $50?
[00:40:16.320]  I don't buy it because I'm like how is turbo tax gonna protect me from getting audited by the government
[00:40:23.040]  But I don't like the fact that the risk of getting audited is there
[00:40:27.440]  So I feel like it's like when it's too official. I'm like, oh like I don't want to do with that
[00:40:31.840]  Okay, yeah, I always get scared by that every time like it's anxiety inducing
[00:40:36.880]  I'm like wait, but then I I slow down and I think about it. I'm like, okay. Why the fuck with the irs
[00:40:42.720]  audit me out of like
[00:40:44.880]  Millions of people in like the us like why would they audit me?
[00:40:50.960]  Yeah, I actually used to like doing taxes like Jessica, but that was when I could get returns
[00:40:57.280]  And then I experienced paying taxes and I was like, whoa, I don't think this is not worth
[00:41:05.680]  I was like, this isn't fun anymore
[00:41:12.640]  Do you all procrastinate on your taxes though?
[00:41:15.040]  I feel like that's the quintessential adult thing to do
[00:41:18.880]  To complain about it till the last minute and then be like, oh, yeah, I did it like the weekend before tax day
[00:41:24.880]  So I'm like very proud of myself this year because I completed my taxes a whole week
[00:41:31.280]  Before the deadline and I was kind of laughing about it because when you file your turbo tax
[00:41:36.080]  It always pulls in your last year's return and like the file so that you can kind of compare
[00:41:40.240]  And it was like, oh last year you submitted your taxes on 417
[00:41:44.560]  And the tax day last year was 418 and I was like, dude, what is wrong with me? Like truly
[00:41:50.960]  I can understand waiting till April but day before is actually that's like a choice
[00:41:55.440]  That was like an active decision made by me
[00:41:58.640]  Oh my god
[00:42:00.000]  I think I'm usually a couple weeks ahead
[00:42:04.000]  The earliest I've ever done it is
[00:42:07.040]  Two months ahead because I had to move in March
[00:42:10.720]  So I was like, okay, I might as well just get this out of the way
[00:42:13.440]  So I did it like early February or something like that
[00:42:16.560]  But I think last year I did it the week of tax day and this year it's looking like it might be similar
[00:42:24.640]  I feel like so far I've been doing them in like February
[00:42:28.800]  Generally when the W2 gets released
[00:42:32.400]  Because I've been talking about it with my coworkers this year
[00:42:35.520]  And I feel like there's actually some merit to waiting a little bit
[00:42:41.040]  Maybe not like the day before or the week before
[00:42:44.560]  Hey, that was once
[00:42:49.200]  But I mean I feel like filing it then is fine as long as you have it figured out before then because what we were talking about was
[00:42:57.280]  That there were quite a few people like coworkers who I talked to this year who there was like a mistake on their W2
[00:43:05.040]  And I was like, oh my god
[00:43:06.560]  I've never even considered that to be a possibility like that's never happened to me
[00:43:10.720]  But then I'm also like maybe that has happened to me. I'm just like
[00:43:15.120]  Speeding through it and not catching it or like not, you know
[00:43:18.480]  I feel like it's I mean with like the puny amount of money that I make it's like probably not that much
[00:43:22.880]  But my Parker is talking about how the math was not math thing on their taxes
[00:43:28.320]  And so they like went back to their W2 and like
[00:43:31.280]  Went line by line and figured out that there was a mistake and was like comparing it to their like paystas and stuff like that
[00:43:37.840]  Like crazy stuff. So I was like, whoa
[00:43:40.720]  That didn't even occur to me
[00:43:43.200]  Maybe next year I would be a little bit more diligent and like
[00:43:47.680]  Actually checking a little bit more
[00:43:50.720]  To just make sure that things look correct. Yeah before rushing to submit
[00:43:57.440]  But then even then I think starting the paperwork and filing early
[00:44:02.160]  Just not submitting early
[00:44:03.520]  It's still beneficial, right? Because if you catch the mistake you have the time to like
[00:44:07.600]  Tell the company get your updated W2 and all that
[00:44:11.200]  But if you did wait till the you know last minute, you'd be like wait shoot. Can I get an extension? Like I'm fucked
[00:44:17.760]  Maybe like get the calculator. I'm doing this right now
[00:44:22.880]  You're like you would probably have to hire an accountant at that point
[00:44:27.680]  Dude, I think the dream is someday you're comfortable enough to like hire an accountant to do your taxes for you
[00:44:34.720]  That would be amazing
[00:44:36.080]  Yeah, dude, but I'm just laughing at Jessica just being like they wake up my w2 just drop
[00:44:47.280]  I'm like logging on to adp every day. Is it here yet? Like do I have a yeah?
[00:44:53.440]  Okay one thing
[00:44:54.960]  That I think you sometimes have to wait a bit for
[00:44:59.280]  But usually I think you don't have to wait later than like mid
[00:45:03.680]  To end of February but like sometimes if you have a
[00:45:07.360]  A trading account
[00:45:08.320]  I think there's some paperwork that you get from them and then they usually send that out towards like
[00:45:13.680]  February or something
[00:45:14.800]  So I remember like that year that I did it early
[00:45:17.120]  I was like waiting for it to come out. It's like, please I need this to come out so I can do my taxes
[00:45:21.440]  Before I like don't know when I can do them next
[00:45:24.640]  True
[00:45:25.360]  It's honestly so funny though because when the tax documents are ready
[00:45:29.520]  It shoots you an email, right? And it's like, oh your tax documents are ready in your account
[00:45:33.360]  and I feel like I always click through and
[00:45:35.920]  I think similar to Jessica like I'm not huge into investing and stuff like I kind of let
[00:45:39.920]  James handle it if he wants to or if not, just don't ask me financial advice basically
[00:45:44.720]  So when I open the documents sometimes it's like, oh, please report this on your taxes this year
[00:45:49.600]  It's like $15. I'm like bro
[00:45:53.760]  Like are you sure I'm like the fact that I have to report this is crazy
[00:45:58.000]  I know
[00:45:59.120]  It's like less than a $20 bill
[00:46:02.080]  I think I like fucked up somewhere along the way too because
[00:46:06.000]  My first job I had a 401k
[00:46:09.600]  And instead of rolling it over to my new jobs 401k, I just rolled it over to a personal
[00:46:16.000]  IRA account I guess
[00:46:17.760]  And so now I always have to submit the like info for that
[00:46:21.680]  And I'm like
[00:46:23.360]  Okay, like why did I do this? I'm a fool
[00:46:26.320]  I have to manage this account myself now and like report about it
[00:46:30.960]  I just like low key stop touching it because
[00:46:33.920]  Luckily there's not that much money in it because I think I only worked for a year with that job
[00:46:38.240]  So I was like, okay, I'll just like leave it be so I don't have to worry too much
[00:46:42.400]  I could send in like blank statements. Yeah, dude. Here's my fucking beef with taxes, by the way
[00:46:47.520]  I don't understand how when you open something you have to give everyone at least financial institutions your social security number
[00:46:54.160]  So I'm like you guys have all our info. Why don't you do your
[00:46:57.600]  Like do our taxes
[00:46:59.680]  Wait, that's true. Like if they're gonna check our taxes
[00:47:02.960]  Doesn't that mean they're doing it too? Like why don't they just I think I saw a meme once that was like the IRS is basically like
[00:47:11.040]  Oh, you have taxes due and then you respond like oh, how much they're like, heehee. I won't tell you you have to calculate it yourself
[00:47:21.120]  So true
[00:47:23.440]  I think what actually happens though is like
[00:47:26.240]  I'm pretty sure turbo tax and like other companies who have these types of products
[00:47:32.400]  Lobby the shit out of the government to like not provide
[00:47:36.720]  The taxing like filing for free and I know there are free
[00:47:40.880]  Programs out there and I think
[00:47:43.200]  One might be new for this year or from last year or something that is actually like from the government
[00:47:49.200]  That allows you to like file taxes like directly with the government
[00:47:52.320]  But I haven't used it. I think I I mean I saw on tech talking people were like use this instead of turbo tax
[00:47:57.520]  Well blah, but I don't know actually like how user friendly it is and like I mean considering that's built by the government
[00:48:03.440]  It's probably not that user friendly
[00:48:05.520]  I'm like is there audit defense on it?
[00:48:09.520]  For $50 or is that for you?
[00:48:12.800]  So I think now we've talked about adulting tasks that are fun and exciting for us versus
[00:48:18.160]  Tasks that maybe feel a little bit more boring
[00:48:20.880]  But the reality of being an adult is that whether it's boring or fun. You still have to like do everything and get all your
[00:48:26.560]  Shit done. So is there anything that you guys do to kind of?
[00:48:31.120]  Inspire yourself to tackle these tasks that you might find boring
[00:48:34.560]  So I was talking to gc about this
[00:48:36.960]  and
[00:48:38.080]  One thing that I do is I have a lot of
[00:48:41.680]  YouTubers who I follow
[00:48:43.680]  Some of them will make these productive day in the life with me videos or
[00:48:49.280]  I also watch a lot of like cleaning videos
[00:48:52.560]  And like organizational videos that bring me a lot of joy
[00:48:56.320]  Usually what I'll do is like if I'm
[00:48:59.840]  Eating dinner or lunch or something
[00:49:02.080]  I put on one of these like, you know productive day in the life videos
[00:49:05.280]  Or like watch me clean and stuff like that that those videos really really inspire me
[00:49:11.040]  To go and clean and organize afterwards
[00:49:14.880]  Yeah, I feel like those are usually almost like nine out of ten times
[00:49:18.480]  I'm inspired after watching those videos and I'll like go and deep clean my kitchen or if I'm watching it at like 10
[00:49:25.120]  P.m. I'll like get out of bed and like start sweeping the floor or like cleaning the counters or some shit
[00:49:30.960]  It's highly effective
[00:49:32.960]  I would recommend dude. You're basically pre-gaming all your adulting tasks by watching someone else do it
[00:49:39.600]  I feel like that does help a lot
[00:49:42.400]  Yeah, like seeing other people be productive in a really like
[00:49:47.360]  Efficient or a satisfying way totally makes you feel like wait. I can do that too. Like let me go do it
[00:49:52.800]  I can relate to that. I think it inspires me sometimes too
[00:49:56.880]  I actually focused more on the after
[00:50:00.160]  So i'm like, oh, you know like after I do this I deserve a treat
[00:50:05.520]  Yes
[00:50:06.880]  That too
[00:50:07.920]  Yeah, I did my taxes. So you know, I deserve to eat a yummy meal today or something like that
[00:50:14.560]  Like a reward system exactly exactly
[00:50:17.440]  Dude, that reminds me of when people used to study and then on textbooks they would like put m&m's or some shit
[00:50:22.480]  So it's like after you read this passage you eat the something
[00:50:25.280]  whoa
[00:50:26.880]  I feel like another thing is
[00:50:29.200]  You know how
[00:50:30.320]  When you're like for example trying to get into like running or like working out you buy yourself cute running shoes
[00:50:35.600]  Oh my god, you're like yes cute workout clothes and you're like, okay. I'm like so excited to go to the gym
[00:50:40.000]  We're so excited to go running
[00:50:42.160]  And I feel like there's definitely some of that for me
[00:50:45.840]  Organizing or like cleaning or like doing some life admin stuff
[00:50:49.200]  Maybe I get to you know, like I'll go to Target. I'll buy like a new scrub daddy or
[00:50:57.360]  Like I'm like, okay, I'm gonna try a new brand of like all-purpose cleaner and
[00:51:02.720]  I actually understand. No, I agree. I agree sometimes buying those cleaning supplies you're like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna go home and clean
[00:51:10.640]  Yeah, but the problem with that method is sometimes I feel like I get so into the research of like, oh, what should I buy?
[00:51:16.720]  And then I buy it. I'm like, yeah, I don't want to do this anymore
[00:51:21.040]  Wait, so that's why you need a you need to pair it with like the video
[00:51:24.880]  So you watch the videos and they're like, oh like I recommend this brand at this brand
[00:51:29.440]  You're like, oh, holy shit. You got a target you buy that shit come back
[00:51:32.720]  Like watch the video again see how they use it and then you start using it, you know
[00:51:36.560]  The cocktail of like pre-gaming
[00:51:42.240]  Okay, I also actually think planning ahead helps a lot so I'm thinking of like taxes
[00:51:48.400]  I kind of like budget for that almost I'll make sure to spend more responsibly for the
[00:51:53.680]  You know quarter one make sure that I'm like also mentally prepared
[00:51:58.640]  Expect the worst and then you know, everything will be better when you're actually doing it
[00:52:03.200]  I think that makes a ton of sense and mine is kind of similar to both of your guys's because I feel like there is some sort of
[00:52:09.120]  merit of like
[00:52:10.320]  Pulling the mood together like getting into the right mood to tackle something
[00:52:14.160]  But I also think that planning can help you get into that mood even further
[00:52:18.720]  So for me, I feel like if I know I have all this car stuff to do or all this financial stuff to do
[00:52:24.160]  I'll like batch the tasks so that I can just like tackle all of it and like get it all done in one go
[00:52:29.600]  And that helps with like crossing a bunch of shit off the list
[00:52:32.480]  But also even within the financial task
[00:52:35.120]  I feel like some things are fun to do and some things are like
[00:52:38.080]  Boring so kind of like alternating between those and making sure you have that good balance helps a lot too
[00:52:43.760]  Yeah
[00:52:44.160]  If I'm looking at the list of things that you know, quote unquote life admin
[00:52:49.440]  Requires you to do from like taxes to like, you know booking your your insurance stuff
[00:52:55.760]  Doing that to even like meal planning and like buying your groceries and like having all of that planned out
[00:53:01.440]  I feel like the things that
[00:53:03.520]  motivate me the most are the ones where
[00:53:07.040]  For example for me taxes where I'm like getting some kind of benefit back or like renew my passport where it's like
[00:53:13.520]  I get a shiny new passport and honestly like I don't even mind going to the dnb to like get a new
[00:53:19.680]  license because
[00:53:21.760]  that I get a new license
[00:53:23.920]  Wait, I like that mindset though. You're like focusing on the reward aspect of it. Yeah
[00:53:29.440]  I think I'm also very motivated by like
[00:53:33.040]  Having a booking on my calendar or like seeing the little bits of progress that you're making
[00:53:38.800]  Even if I don't you know, enjoy being at the dentist
[00:53:42.000]  I get a lot of joy out of booking my appointment to go to the dentist
[00:53:46.160]  That makes me feel really productive
[00:53:48.480]  And so if it's stuff that I don't necessarily want to do or like sit down and do
[00:53:53.920]  I feel like it could be beneficial to like
[00:53:56.560]  I don't know just like book time on your calendar to be like, okay this day
[00:54:00.080]  I'm like, we're gonna go to a coffee shop and like sit down and like just like knock the sound
[00:54:03.600]  It's like an appointment with myself and or you know with somebody else get some friends together and like have like a
[00:54:10.480]  tax filing party
[00:54:14.640]  I don't know about that one, but
[00:54:17.360]  I will say though sometimes I see my parents doing their taxes together and I'm like, wow they actually have someone to do
[00:54:25.200]  You know to like suffer together with me while I'm in my room doing it myself
[00:54:29.680]  So I have a question
[00:54:31.440]  Jisoo since you're now married
[00:54:33.840]  You do have someone who can either do taxes with you at the same time or like file together with you
[00:54:40.160]  Do you feel like that is
[00:54:41.920]  Like a better feeling than doing it by yourself
[00:54:44.400]  I think it definitely is and
[00:54:46.720]  To be honest since James and I have been living together like
[00:54:49.600]  Since we started first filing taxes probably I feel like we've always done taxes together, which has been great
[00:54:55.360]  And it's kind of nice because
[00:54:57.360]  It's not like oh shit like when can I fit in taxes into my schedule?
[00:55:00.160]  It's like oh when can we fit in taxes into ours?
[00:55:04.240]  So at least there's two brains thinking about it. Yeah, I feel like it's nice too because sometimes when I'm by myself
[00:55:09.760]  I'm like yo what the fuck is happening like I need some help right now
[00:55:13.440]  What does this mean? Is this applicable to me?
[00:55:16.720]  To be fair
[00:55:17.280]  I do think the tax app that I use
[00:55:19.840]  Tries its best to explain everything but I feel like sometimes you're still very lost
[00:55:23.840]  Like we're still relatively new in the grand scheme of things to doing taxes
[00:55:27.840]  So I'm like okay some of these more complicated things. I literally don't know what's happening
[00:55:32.160]  And to be honest there's like many instances where whether it's taxes or other like
[00:55:37.680]  Kind of adulting related tasks where we James and I still call our parents and we're like mom like how do you do this?
[00:55:44.080]  Like please help
[00:55:45.520]  And now that we're 27 28, I feel like it's kind of like less funny
[00:55:49.520]  But honestly like you know call a parent chance always exists. It's like always out there. So
[00:55:54.960]  Dude, that's always a backup
[00:55:56.800]  The craziest shit was actually the first time setting up my 401k
[00:56:01.120]  I was like, oh my god. What is going on? Like what is maxing it out mean?
[00:56:04.720]  Like you know what how do I do this and my parents were like, yo, I don't know that shit either
[00:56:08.720]  Like you're on and I was like wait
[00:56:10.880]  Like do you guys not have one?
[00:56:12.880]  They're like, hmm. I suggest you look into it yourself like I'm not sure we can help you
[00:56:18.000]  I was like, oh my god
[00:56:20.880]  Wait, my mom literally just gave me wrong information this year
[00:56:26.880]  Like she kept bothering me about I'm like, I already filed my taxes like there's nothing but she kept badgering me about like my company stocks
[00:56:34.720]  Oh, yeah
[00:56:35.120]  So for my dad
[00:56:36.720]  I think his company or one of his previous comes here or whatever like the way that they
[00:56:41.440]  Vest their stocks and like or like it vests for you is that they
[00:56:45.600]  Sell part of your stock to cover for the taxes like that
[00:56:49.760]  The stocks that you receive, right?
[00:56:51.360]  And so it counts as like a sale even though you yourself did not sell anything but they'll like sell it for you
[00:56:57.440]  And so you need to like report that in your tax returns and you like get a whole
[00:57:01.600]  piece of paper for it or whatever
[00:57:03.360]  And I was like my mom so my mom kept on badgering me about it and I was like
[00:57:07.680]  I don't have that like what it like I
[00:57:11.360]  Company has never told me that they sold anything to me like when it vests for me
[00:57:15.280]  It just vests. It's just like sitting there. Like I haven't sold anything. I haven't touched it
[00:57:20.080]  She's like, yeah, but you still need a pilot on your taxes the whole block
[00:57:23.520]  So then I finally had to go and like google a ton of stuff and and then finally I found
[00:57:30.640]  Where it like tells you that your stocks can vest in multiple different ways
[00:57:35.840]  Like sometimes companies will sell part of your stock to cover for the taxes and sometimes they'll like withhold it
[00:57:41.360]  So you just don't get that portion of your stocks like number of stocks that you receive is less
[00:57:47.120]  To cover for the taxes and I was like, okay. Well, like this is me
[00:57:52.160]  And my mom was like
[00:57:58.080]  You're literally feeding me false information and like freaking me out like a month after I've already submitted my taxes
[00:58:05.760]  For no reason because I I was like I checked every single possible account
[00:58:10.560]  I may have related to my stocks and there is no
[00:58:14.880]  Form like I don't have a 1099 dash whatever whatever like it's just not there
[00:58:19.520]  And by this time it's like late March. So like any forms that I should have should be in there and there's nothing there
[00:58:24.560]  so I was like mother
[00:58:27.680]  No, you're more educated now
[00:58:30.480]  That's true, right
[00:58:31.760]  But that is really funny. Yeah, so like be careful when you phone a mom
[00:58:35.680]  For the parent so google is still your best friend
[00:58:39.920]  Maybe no one's running from that
[00:58:42.320]  You could still call them but fact check them. Yeah
[00:58:46.880]  Or just get an accountant if you can
