[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Michelle.
[00:00:16.670] [SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Michelle, a familiar voice of the podcast. The last episode Michelle was on was
[00:00:23.610] [SPEAKER_02]: episode 201, Relationship Labels, where we talked about domestic partnerships, marriage,
[00:00:30.570] [SPEAKER_02]: all of those labels, very fun episode. But today we brought Michelle on to talk about building
[00:00:37.190] [SPEAKER_02]: community slash finding community. I think the Bay Area is very suburb heavy. So sometimes it can
[00:00:45.350] [SPEAKER_02]: be difficult to find community in more sparse areas like this. And Michelle has been doing
[00:00:51.610] [SPEAKER_02]: some pretty cool like community building events. So we thought it'd be really fun to
[00:00:56.190] [SPEAKER_00]: more about that. Yeah, so I guess to kind of kickstart the episode today, let's talk about
[00:01:02.210] [SPEAKER_00]: community that we feel in this current day. Do you feel like right now your life is full of
[00:01:07.830] [SPEAKER_01]: community vibes? I love the term community vibes. Yeah, I love it. Like, it's a good way
[00:01:14.370] [SPEAKER_01]: to frame it. Like, I'm feeling community vibes in my life. How about you guys? I think
[00:01:19.390] [SPEAKER_02]: in terms of friendship, yes, there is almost like a micro communities within the friend groups I
[00:01:26.050] [SPEAKER_02]: have of you know, people who like to do certain things. These groups of people like to play
[00:01:30.790] [SPEAKER_02]: pickleball. These groups of people like to watch movies. But in terms of community
[00:01:35.870] [SPEAKER_02]: around me that aren't just friends who have been friends for many years. I don't really
[00:01:41.630] [SPEAKER_01]: have that. That's funny that you say that because I think you specifically crystal are
[00:01:46.130] [SPEAKER_01]: great community builder. With this podcast, you have a community, right? That's true actually.
[00:01:52.770] [SPEAKER_01]: Your crust community we had I remember I was there for the five year celebration.
[00:01:58.090] [SPEAKER_01]: When I was also thinking about it, crystal, like you're planning your high school reunion.
[00:02:02.410] [SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge community you're a part of. That's true. So I think you're you're great
[00:02:07.350] [SPEAKER_02]: at bringing people together. I guess because I see it almost differently because it's like
[00:02:12.710] [SPEAKER_02]: people that I already know and then building that community is a little different from like
[00:02:18.430] [SPEAKER_02]: putting myself out into a community of strangers. If that makes sense?
[00:02:24.270] [SPEAKER_00]: I think that's kind of similar to how I see it too. So for example, hanging out with friends
[00:02:29.170] [SPEAKER_00]: that I've known since college or high school or whatever on the weekend is very social and fun.
[00:02:34.730] [SPEAKER_00]: But I don't necessarily see it like I'm building a community. But if I were to go to
[00:02:39.490] [SPEAKER_00]: my local park, play pickleball and say I know like a bunch of the people who are there,
[00:02:44.570] [SPEAKER_00]: I might feel like yeah, this is a big sense of community because maybe I think that community
[00:02:49.190] [SPEAKER_00]: is more location based or like it happens to you versus friendships and existing connections
[00:02:55.510] [SPEAKER_00]: are something that I keep building upon rather than like creating from scratch.
[00:03:00.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Location is interesting because I didn't even think about like my neighbors really or like
[00:03:06.290] [SPEAKER_01]: I have no community in this condo building I live in. I don't talk to my neighbors,
[00:03:12.630] [SPEAKER_01]: we don't know each other, we stay out of each other's way.
[00:03:16.130] [SPEAKER_01]: They all sleep at like 10pm.
[00:03:17.910] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like building community with your neighbors is low key hard. I have one neighbor
[00:03:23.470] [SPEAKER_02]: and my apartment situation is kind of like a duplex. I have like one neighbor I literally
[00:03:29.810] [SPEAKER_02]: share a wall with. And when they moved in, I just could not bring myself to introduce
[00:03:35.450] [SPEAKER_02]: myself and say hi. And we've been neighbors for a couple months now. We've never interacted at
[00:03:41.650] [SPEAKER_01]: all. Yeah, no same. I don't. Yeah, I don't know what it is about neighbors. It's
[00:03:49.550] [SPEAKER_01]: intimidating. But I can see like the distinction that you guys are getting at like, oh, like
[00:04:08.450] [SPEAKER_02]: I think there is a sense of community when you bring different friend groups together.
[00:04:17.870] [SPEAKER_02]: For example, when you mentioned our like, 50 year anniversary for the podcast,
[00:04:22.830] [SPEAKER_02]: I think it was really cool to just stand there and kind of look and be like, wow,
[00:04:27.070] [SPEAKER_02]: all these people have now one common like shared thread among them, even though a lot
[00:04:33.350] [SPEAKER_01]: of them might not even know each other at all. Yes, totally. Because I met people at that
[00:04:38.870] [SPEAKER_01]: party. And yeah, like it was fun to be like, what episode were you on? Or like,
[00:04:43.790] [SPEAKER_01]: how do you know Jisoo? And how do you know Crystal? You guys are definitely building
[00:04:47.210] [SPEAKER_00]: a community. So Michelle, you did mention that right now you're feeling strong community
[00:04:52.190] [SPEAKER_00]: vibes. I feel like myself and Crystal maybe we're not quite to that extent yet. But I am
[00:04:57.250] [SPEAKER_00]: really curious to hear what kind of things that are happening in your life that bring the most
[00:05:01.370] [SPEAKER_01]: community vibes. I think it helps to live in the city, like in SF, where I feel like there
[00:05:09.050] [SPEAKER_01]: is like a strong sense of SF pride. Like you know how the media says things about the city that
[00:05:16.950] [SPEAKER_01]: usually really negative about crime, about homelessness. And I see it but like the
[00:05:21.970] [SPEAKER_01]: people in SF also including me really love it here. We like see the beauty in the city.
[00:05:27.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is like a good community to mention, but like I'm in r slash SF,
[00:05:34.410] [SPEAKER_01]: loves the community there not that I'm active, I just lurk. It's full of positive stuff most of
[00:05:40.290] [SPEAKER_01]: the time like about how beautiful our city is and how much we love it. The events that are
[00:05:45.010] [SPEAKER_01]: going on. I try to keep up with fun community based events that are happening in the city and
[00:05:50.870] [SPEAKER_01]: I try my best to make it out. The city is one that I really feel part of. I like that you
[00:05:56.450] [SPEAKER_02]: brought up Reddit because I do think there is some value in like online communities.
[00:06:01.990] [SPEAKER_02]: I love to read subreddits after I watch TV show episodes. And that's kind of community.
[00:06:08.390] [SPEAKER_02]: You're like, Oh my god, these people are thinking the same thing as me. Although I'm
[00:06:12.390] [SPEAKER_00]: just a lurker. So yes, yeah, I can't be posting. Maybe a lot of it is just like we have these
[00:06:21.250] [SPEAKER_00]: shared experiences with people around us. And that's not always super common or like easy to
[00:06:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]: find. So I also to feel like almost like a sense of home when I see people who have
[00:06:32.410] [SPEAKER_00]: watched the same thing as me or live in a similar place and care about it as much
[00:06:35.970] [SPEAKER_00]: as I do. So that is probably huge. And I don't know, it's kind of interesting. I used
[00:06:41.170] [SPEAKER_00]: to live in San Francisco, but that was during peak COVID time. So it wasn't very community
[00:06:46.810] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling like I remember Crystal and I would joke, I would just look into people's
[00:06:50.710] [SPEAKER_00]: apartments. And that was like community building for me because I'd be like you exist too.
[00:06:59.050] [SPEAKER_00]: Like guys, leave your lights on after dark. But now I live in a kind of a smaller city
[00:07:05.510] [SPEAKER_00]: that's very suburban. And I also feel a little bit of a community vibe here too. So I guess
[00:07:11.790] [SPEAKER_00]: even if I'm not in like a very metro area, I still feel like being in a slightly smaller
[00:07:16.650] [SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, I can see other people also care about this community. Yeah, I've done things
[00:07:21.390] [SPEAKER_01]: in SF that I wouldn't have done back in my hometown. Like I participated in like
[00:07:26.550] [SPEAKER_01]: city cleanups, we all wore vests and like picked up trash in our neighborhood. And that was
[00:07:33.310] [SPEAKER_01]: really sweet. A few parks just open near me and they'll have events like they'll have like a
[00:07:38.810] [SPEAKER_01]: flea market or like, oh, fuck you guys are just trying to run club. Oh my god. Like for this
[00:07:43.850] [SPEAKER_01]: part of the city. Yeah, that's I mean, I haven't really made friends yet. But it is a great
[00:07:49.590] [SPEAKER_01]: place to make friends. Yeah. And like date apparently. But like that's just really fun
[00:07:54.850] [SPEAKER_01]: too. Like people all over the city come just to run five miles together. And everyone's
[00:07:59.530] [SPEAKER_02]: nice and welcoming and open. Oh my god, I've also heard that run clubs are like the new
[00:08:07.290] [SPEAKER_01]: way to date. Yeah, like it makes so much sense. You have something in common where
[00:08:14.290] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe you don't love I don't love running but I'm willing to run
[00:08:20.010] [SPEAKER_01]: at that time and moment with 200 other people. So 200 community. Wait, so walk us through
[00:08:27.810] [SPEAKER_02]: a running club meeting. Have you attended one yet? Yes, we meet up at the baseball stadium.
[00:08:33.550] [SPEAKER_01]: There's music playing. We do warm ups together. You know, like, like jumping,
[00:08:41.630] [SPEAKER_01]: like jumping and stretching and stuff. And then they're just like, all right, let's go.
[00:08:46.870] [SPEAKER_01]: And then after every mile, we stop at a park and we do more exercises together. But the
[00:08:53.270] [SPEAKER_01]: time people have like speakers on their backs, like playing music. And like on the way you go
[00:09:00.770] [SPEAKER_01]: at your own pace and they're kind of like, no one gets left behind. But sometimes I wish
[00:09:04.570] [SPEAKER_01]: they would leave me behind. Oh, yeah, yeah. So there's time to talk and stuff after every
[00:09:10.130] [SPEAKER_02]: mile. I see. So it's like you pause at each park so that the like slower crowd can catch
[00:09:16.470] [SPEAKER_02]: up to the faster crowd. And then you like start the next mile or whatever together. Yeah.
[00:09:21.490] [SPEAKER_01]: At the end, there's a huge high five train. Oh my god. Whoa. The longest high five tunnels I've
[00:09:28.930] [SPEAKER_01]: ever walked through. And then usually they go to a bar. Have I been? No. But you're like, hey,
[00:09:36.930] [SPEAKER_01]: guys, I got to run. Yeah, I got to go back. Yeah. But yeah, that's a great I felt a great
[00:09:42.270] [SPEAKER_01]: sense of community doing that, like seeing different parts of the city, while also
[00:09:47.280] [SPEAKER_01]: being out of breath with my fellow runners. I actually feel like sports or just any sort
[00:09:56.040] [SPEAKER_00]: of exercise in general is very community building because I went to core power yoga
[00:10:01.840] [SPEAKER_00]: a little bit in San Francisco and a little bit where I'm living now. And the community
[00:10:06.820] [SPEAKER_00]: vibes there strong, I don't even know why I don't even have to talk to the people around
[00:10:10.880] [SPEAKER_00]: me. But I'm just like, dude, we're all here doing the same thing. Like this is
[00:10:14.720] [SPEAKER_00]: fucking insane. Yeah, or my husband plays volleyball sometimes. And these are like huge
[00:10:20.480] [SPEAKER_00]: organized tournaments with like hundreds of people, some people in like matching shirts
[00:10:25.340] [SPEAKER_00]: and stuff. And I'm like, this is this is us like we're out here. Speaking of sports,
[00:10:30.540] [SPEAKER_01]: like I, Andy made me join frisbee league with him. So have I played frisbee before? No,
[00:10:37.500] [SPEAKER_01]: but I joined and I didn't grow up playing group sports, team sports. But I think frisbee is
[00:10:45.060] [SPEAKER_01]: like the perfect one to start on because everyone is super friendly. And they're willing
[00:10:49.500] [SPEAKER_01]: to teach me and ultimate is really cheesy in the way that it's all about the spirit of
[00:10:55.020] [SPEAKER_01]: the game, quote unquote, the spirit of the game. For every game, we have a spirit winner
[00:11:00.160] [SPEAKER_01]: on each team. You pick a spirit winner, you chant to the other team, you like come up with
[00:11:06.380] [SPEAKER_01]: a chant to encourage the other team win or lose. So that I felt like very, it was very
[00:11:12.420] [SPEAKER_01]: welcoming and open despite being a newbie. That's nice. I think that's also a good one
[00:11:16.960] [SPEAKER_02]: because ultimate frisbee isn't really like a high school sport, at least in the Bay
[00:11:20.920] [SPEAKER_02]: from our experiences. So I feel like everyone is slightly on more even footing.
[00:11:26.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Crystal, these people have been playing. Okay, we began in a circle and they'd be
[00:11:32.420] [SPEAKER_01]: everybody tell us how much experience you have playing frisbee. And people would be like,
[00:11:36.740] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing for 30 years and I feel like it gets to me. I'd be like,
[00:11:41.660] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing since September. There's oldies who've been playing their entire lives. So
[00:11:49.960] [SPEAKER_01]: it was harder obviously to break into that community, even though everyone was really
[00:11:53.920] [SPEAKER_01]: friendly. But it's like these are dedicated people who have been playing forever. Okay,
[00:12:02.400] [SPEAKER_02]: but even he was really good. Okay, nevermind about being on the same level, but I do think
[00:12:09.880] [SPEAKER_02]: rec sports and like rec leagues are definitely super fun. I did one in New York once it was
[00:12:16.100] [SPEAKER_02]: like beach volleyball. And I think because like it's a team sport, whether or not you
[00:12:21.500] [SPEAKER_02]: win or lose, you can literally see you and your friends improving even on that exact game
[00:12:29.200] [SPEAKER_02]: and then everyone's just so much more hyped up after the game ends. It's like, oh my god,
[00:12:34.080] [SPEAKER_02]: hey guys, if we just put in like one hour of practice, we could annihilate everyone in this
[00:12:38.640] [SPEAKER_02]: league. And then we're like, dude, yeah, like we should totally meet up over the
[00:12:42.940] [SPEAKER_02]: over the week and like practice so we can win next week. Or if we win the game,
[00:12:47.140] [SPEAKER_02]: it's just like, oh my god, like we improved so much. Look at us go. And I feel like
[00:12:51.880] [SPEAKER_02]: that is just like a really great feeling that makes everyone feel connected.
[00:12:57.080] [SPEAKER_01]: Totally doing sports with your friends, like improving and like getting sweaty. And like,
[00:13:02.920] [SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's that's good. I wish I could do more of that active sports things. I feel like
[00:13:10.220] [SPEAKER_01]: besides frisbee, I did like a volleyball league once without knowing the rules of volleyball.
[00:13:15.900] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was tough. That's true. I think ultimately sports are still very difficult.
[00:13:20.520] [SPEAKER_02]: So like, if you don't feel like it, no need to force yourself into like rec leagues.
[00:13:26.440] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. Or, you know, like, I guess speaking of sports, like fan bases are huge communities,
[00:13:32.240] [SPEAKER_01]: right? Eric, my partner, he and his friends are all Warriors fans or they're all 49er fans.
[00:13:39.220] [SPEAKER_01]: I just can't get into that community. That's just not the community for me,
[00:13:43.700] [SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately. But I'm like, I seeing that I, I really admire it. I wish I could play
[00:13:48.840] [SPEAKER_00]: it. But I just can't. I feel like there's also maybe non sports space things that build a big
[00:13:54.440] [SPEAKER_00]: sense of community. So going to like a pottery studio, for example, I heard feels very
[00:14:00.400] [SPEAKER_00]: community building, even though it's not really like a huge group activity, like you're still
[00:14:05.480] [SPEAKER_00]: all working on your own projects, but maybe similar to yoga. It's like the fact that we're
[00:14:09.960] [SPEAKER_00]: all at this one space at the same time is kind of meaningful. And I have to imagine like
[00:14:16.600] [SPEAKER_00]: other art studios or maybe like music sessions, jamming sessions, like that stuff would also be
[00:14:23.100] [SPEAKER_01]: very beneficial. Yeah, I can speak to the clay studio aspect. I only started ceramics like
[00:14:29.780] [SPEAKER_01]: a year and a half ago. And I'm still not good at all. But putting in the hours and meeting
[00:14:36.180] [SPEAKER_01]: people because I think the shared understanding with ceramics among all people who do it at
[00:14:42.220] [SPEAKER_01]: is that it's really hard. And it takes a lot of time, things are never going to go the way
[00:14:48.140] [SPEAKER_01]: you expect it to be. So I think that mutual understanding amongst everyone that we're all
[00:14:54.520] [SPEAKER_01]: working like on this art form that is incredibly unpredictable and not in our hands at all.
[00:15:01.400] [SPEAKER_01]: It's nice. Somehow like just knowing that all of us are putting our butts went to
[00:15:07.380] [SPEAKER_01]: explode in the kiln. It's really good. I am not like fully into the clay community right now,
[00:15:15.500] [SPEAKER_01]: but I've made friends with the clay studio owner. And that's been nice. And I have made some
[00:15:21.100] [SPEAKER_01]: a few friends through classes. I keep taking classes so that consistency gets me in
[00:15:27.920] [SPEAKER_00]: and seeing the same people and it helps a lot. Oh, also one thing that I guess we didn't
[00:15:32.900] [SPEAKER_00]: hear but I think also builds community is church or like religious organizations.
[00:15:38.520] [SPEAKER_00]: And that just makes me think maybe all of this, like you said, Michelle is just like we're all
[00:15:43.080] [SPEAKER_00]: in this together trying to achieve some sort of common goal or acknowledging that there's
[00:15:49.100] [SPEAKER_00]: some sort of skill set we're trying to build like something that brings us together that
[00:15:52.500] [SPEAKER_00]: we can have in common with people who are virtually strangers right until you meet them
[00:15:56.680] [SPEAKER_01]: the community. Yeah, I've never been religious myself, but I've always really admired that
[00:16:02.980] [SPEAKER_01]: about religion. Like I'll have friends who move to different cities, but every city they go to,
[00:16:08.800] [SPEAKER_01]: even though they go there without knowing anyone, they know that they can go to church
[00:16:12.980] [SPEAKER_01]: there. They'll find a church there and they'll immediately have a community that'll accept
[00:16:16.760] [SPEAKER_01]: them. Dude, it's a cheat code. Seriously. You're so right. Yeah. You're like, I know
[00:16:25.060] [SPEAKER_02]: these people will accept me no matter where I go. Totally. Like were you guys in,
[00:16:30.720] [SPEAKER_01]: not that this is similar to religion, but like sororities or like frats or clubs in high
[00:16:37.780] [SPEAKER_01]: school or college that built your biggest communities? Honestly, yeah, I was in a
[00:16:44.600] [SPEAKER_02]: quote unquote professional fraternity in college. I met some people who I probably would have
[00:16:50.520] [SPEAKER_02]: met otherwise and they're like still good friends. So I feel like it is definitely
[00:16:56.280] [SPEAKER_02]: a nice thread to keep. And I know like some people are super into it. So then like even
[00:17:02.960] [SPEAKER_02]: after college, they're like, oh my God, I was like, you know, from this chapter or from the
[00:17:07.300] [SPEAKER_02]: school of this sorority or fraternity or whatever. And then people literally bond
[00:17:12.180] [SPEAKER_02]: over that. They're like, dude, like I was from this branch or whatever. Yeah. I mean,
[00:17:17.760] [SPEAKER_00]: I was in some high school clubs. I feel like high school clubs are a little bit different
[00:17:22.500] [SPEAKER_00]: because it's very much like we're all trying to get into college. So maybe the common goal is
[00:17:28.560] [SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily as uniting, but still I think you're right. Like you do just get to meet so
[00:17:34.840] [SPEAKER_01]: many people and that is such a huge perk. In high school, like being in ASB was huge for me.
[00:17:43.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Being in the leadership group, like that's where I made like some of my closest friends
[00:17:49.520] [SPEAKER_01]: because we were just planning dances and putting on rallies and stuff. And that was really bonding.
[00:17:55.580] [SPEAKER_01]: In college, I wish I had a tighter community. It was harder for me going out of state and
[00:18:00.700] [SPEAKER_01]: stuff. So it was kind of really tough in the beginning to find my place, I feel like.
[00:18:06.420] [SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm. When I first got to school, to this day, thinking back, I don't think I really
[00:18:13.220] [SPEAKER_01]: found my one place in college, unfortunately, where I made like my deepest closest connections.
[00:18:21.140] [SPEAKER_01]: But you made it here? Yeah, it's okay. I'm here. But we out here. Yeah, but we out here.
[00:18:25.480] [SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't find it in college, I'm a building myself here in the real life.
[00:18:31.800] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, I had kind of like a similar-ish experience in college where I really was kind of
[00:18:37.600] [SPEAKER_00]: like craving that go to network or community. And I think looking back, that kind of sets you
[00:18:44.860] [SPEAKER_00]: up for more community building in the future because I feel like if socializing or networking
[00:18:51.160] [SPEAKER_00]: or having that community always comes very easily, it's not necessarily something that you
[00:18:55.880] [SPEAKER_00]: chase or it may not even be something where you know how to build it up in like a constructive way.
[00:19:02.340] [SPEAKER_00]: But when you do have those feelings of like isolation or anything like that,
[00:19:06.020] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it sets you up to be like a good community leader almost.
[00:19:09.440] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really great point. I think, yeah, in college, since I was trying really hard
[00:19:14.520] [SPEAKER_01]: to find it, you're right, it made me like crave it more, I guess. And now in my adult life,
[00:19:19.100] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot more control over things and I'm like more real as an established as a human.
[00:19:26.400] [SPEAKER_01]: It's easier now, for sure. I can be a leader in my own community, whatever.
[00:19:31.820] [SPEAKER_02]: I think also as we're getting older and becoming more established and comfortable in our skin,
[00:19:38.940] [SPEAKER_02]: we start to realize the untapped potential of some of our hobbies or interests and how that
[00:19:46.380] [SPEAKER_02]: can turn into some sort of community building or just like joining community.
[00:19:52.700] [SPEAKER_02]: I think like I've even found some communities at work, if your company is pretty big,
[00:19:59.180] [SPEAKER_02]: groups naturally form where people are like, hey, we're interested in basketball,
[00:20:03.080] [SPEAKER_02]: let's play pick up basketball every Tuesday during our lunch hour.
[00:20:08.040] [SPEAKER_02]: There's just so many random things. I think like at my work, there's a group of
[00:20:12.180] [SPEAKER_02]: Porsche enthusiasts, I know, right? Or like photography people or even wine and spirits
[00:20:20.500] [SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that. And I think it's pretty cool because you don't always get to see every
[00:20:26.840] [SPEAKER_02]: organization within your company, especially if it's a big one. So then through these
[00:20:32.780] [SPEAKER_02]: little niche groups, you can meet a lot of new people.
[00:20:36.620] [SPEAKER_01]: That's cool. I wish I worked for a pretty big company and they don't,
[00:20:41.400] [SPEAKER_02]: people are not cool like that. You should look through like your Slack channels.
[00:20:46.160] [SPEAKER_01]: Dude, we're not on Slack, we're on Teams. That's what makes it hard. Teams is so lame.
[00:20:53.160] [SPEAKER_02]: It's because like we have Google groups, so you can literally just like search
[00:20:57.260] [SPEAKER_02]: a keyword and then sometimes these groups will pop up and you're like, oh,
[00:21:00.560] [SPEAKER_02]: actually there was a group for this. I'm jealous. I need something like that
[00:21:04.360] [SPEAKER_00]: where I work. Well, I guess pivoting from things that do feel very community building.
[00:21:10.300] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys think that there are things that detract from a sense of community?
[00:21:14.900] [SPEAKER_01]: When I was thinking about this question, I was talking to Eric, we got to like our dorms.
[00:21:20.240] [SPEAKER_01]: He went to another school. He went to Ohio State. I went to Illinois.
[00:21:22.940] [SPEAKER_01]: The first time he visited me, he was like, your dorm is so boring. I was like, oh,
[00:21:29.020] [SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, you're right. I was in substance free housing.
[00:21:33.660] [SPEAKER_01]: And like he was like, everyone's doors are closed. Like how do you make friends?
[00:21:37.340] [SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and then like the guys and girls are separated on each floor.
[00:21:41.600] [SPEAKER_01]: And like, I realized my dorm is pretty lame. I guess people just, if you're a freshman
[00:21:47.960] [SPEAKER_01]: and you live in a dorm, you really have to lean into like the keeping your door open
[00:21:51.880] [SPEAKER_01]: and greeting people and really putting yourself out there. And maybe that's one of the reasons
[00:21:56.640] [SPEAKER_01]: why like I didn't have a great start in finding my community in college, because your dorm,
[00:22:02.940] [SPEAKER_01]: where you live, I was not finding it there. I was in the beginning.
[00:22:08.460] [SPEAKER_01]: Because when I visited Eric's dorm, I was like, oh, I see how other dorms are.
[00:22:15.000] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like everyone stops in. Everyone just barges in,
[00:22:19.020] [SPEAKER_01]: chats, invites you to things. And that was not happening where I was.
[00:22:22.560] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point, Michelle. And I'm not going to lie.
[00:22:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]: I am also the door closed kind of person.
[00:22:32.480] [SPEAKER_02]: It was painfully obvious one time when like
[00:22:36.000] [SPEAKER_02]: I stepped out of my dorm and I realized that like everyone else was kind of friends in my dorm.
[00:22:41.900] [SPEAKER_02]: But like I was not friends with them.
[00:22:44.560] [SPEAKER_02]: They were friendly to me, but I just did not like hang out with them.
[00:22:48.140] [SPEAKER_02]: I was just too like shy or like put forth the effort as well to like talk to them.
[00:22:54.760] [SPEAKER_02]: I just always kept my door closed. I was in a single.
[00:22:57.840] [SPEAKER_02]: I was left to my own devices, which is sometimes dangerous because as my friends have said,
[00:23:03.780] [SPEAKER_02]: it's just very possible for me to like disappear in that case.
[00:23:08.560] [SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of exactly what happened.
[00:23:11.140] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree with the whole like doors being closed,
[00:23:14.480] [SPEAKER_02]: whether that's metaphorically or like physically.
[00:23:16.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think to be open to community building, you have to like really lean into it
[00:23:23.120] [SPEAKER_01]: and like be super open minded.
[00:23:25.700] [SPEAKER_01]: Just be overly enthusiastic, I think, about the thing that connects you all to other people.
[00:23:33.040] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm also thinking even if there is like a
[00:23:37.020] [SPEAKER_02]: local thing that happens for, I don't know, like fruit enthusiasts or something,
[00:23:42.140] [SPEAKER_02]: but then they're like super exclusive and they're just like, yeah, you can't join us.
[00:23:46.640] [SPEAKER_02]: Unless like you go through this complicated application process,
[00:23:50.660] [SPEAKER_02]: then it would be very community detracting.
[00:23:53.820] [SPEAKER_00]: Wait fruit enthusiast? That's like the funniest example ever.
[00:23:59.160] [SPEAKER_00]: But I think like both of you guys said, sometimes when I think back on moments where
[00:24:03.280] [SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted that sense of community but wasn't able to get it,
[00:24:06.820] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of it came from internally,
[00:24:10.120] [SPEAKER_00]: where maybe I wasn't ready to feel vulnerable and I just wanted to stay feeling comfortable,
[00:24:15.520] [SPEAKER_00]: which is essentially not putting yourself out there.
[00:24:18.780] [SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of that comes from like fear of rejection sometimes,
[00:24:22.940] [SPEAKER_00]: where it's like a process, like you really have to be like okay to show that you are
[00:24:28.580] [SPEAKER_00]: excited and eager and maybe even more excited and eager than other people out there
[00:24:32.620] [SPEAKER_00]: to like find new friends or build that sense of community,
[00:24:35.640] [SPEAKER_00]: which can definitely be scary.
[00:24:37.460] [SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of feel like you usually get what you put out there
[00:24:41.420] [SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully that's more encouraging and less discouraging because if you put in the work,
[00:24:47.540] [SPEAKER_00]: it is probably a lot easier to actually find friends or build community.
[00:24:51.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree. You really have to push yourself.
[00:24:54.320] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been hosting some events here and there and dude, it's really hard.
[00:25:00.100] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm a really extroverted person. I really like being around people.
[00:25:03.700] [SPEAKER_01]: But to have to play host to many strangers is exhausting.
[00:25:12.100] [SPEAKER_01]: I get super anxious even though I love being around people and meeting new people.
[00:25:18.600] [SPEAKER_01]: I am the nights before these events that I host, I am so anxiety ridden
[00:25:25.160] [SPEAKER_01]: and for what? Like everyone just comes and has a good time.
[00:25:29.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't I'm just planning it. They just show up and enjoy themselves.
[00:25:33.700] [SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you really have to.
[00:25:36.220] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like me putting on like 200% in order to play host.
[00:25:42.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Right and I'm sure there's like the whole all the worries about like
[00:25:46.260] [SPEAKER_02]: will anyone show up? Will they have fun?
[00:25:48.980] [SPEAKER_02]: Will they notice all the things that I did for them? That kind of stuff.
[00:25:53.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in the last event I did, there were actually like too many people,
[00:25:57.500] [SPEAKER_01]: which is a great problem to have but it was also like really scary.
[00:26:01.460] [SPEAKER_01]: I hosted a collage club and pottery painting night at my clay studio.
[00:26:07.680] [SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly free and when people see free and they see other people going,
[00:26:13.880] [SPEAKER_01]: the numbers just keep climbing and climbing. The studio is not a big one.
[00:26:18.520] [SPEAKER_01]: So about 100 people RSVP.
[00:26:21.060] [SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[00:26:22.020] [SPEAKER_01]: There was no 100 people cannot fit in the space you guys like.
[00:26:27.400] [SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that was hard and at some points like people were on the floor.
[00:26:33.280] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[00:26:34.380] [SPEAKER_01]: To like collage and paint stuff with their friends
[00:26:37.300] [SPEAKER_01]: and I was scrambling to move things aside so people would have space.
[00:26:41.680] [SPEAKER_01]: It all ended up working out but yeah sometimes the cost of building community
[00:26:45.280] [SPEAKER_01]: is a little bit of your sanity.
[00:26:48.340] [SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what inspired you to throw and host these big community events?
[00:26:53.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was actually I had two friends.
[00:26:56.460] [SPEAKER_01]: They met on TikTok because both of them were commenting saying that SF needs some sort of like
[00:27:04.420] [SPEAKER_01]: collage community for anyone to come to.
[00:27:08.160] [SPEAKER_01]: Both of them happen to be hoarders.
[00:27:10.600] [SPEAKER_01]: My friends Nicole and Zai.
[00:27:12.680] [SPEAKER_01]: They found free community spaces at sports basement here in the city.
[00:27:17.820] [SPEAKER_01]: You can use their warehouses to host free events.
[00:27:21.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and then when they first started it,
[00:27:23.380] [SPEAKER_01]: it was like they just laid out all their materials
[00:27:27.360] [SPEAKER_01]: and just invited people to come.
[00:27:29.400] [SPEAKER_01]: They said no one showed up the first one.
[00:27:33.080] [SPEAKER_01]: As people started showing up so this is totally without me
[00:27:35.520] [SPEAKER_01]: but as people started showing up it started getting popular
[00:27:38.500] [SPEAKER_01]: and like 20 people 30 people and that's when I started coming.
[00:27:43.900] [SPEAKER_01]: And since I showed so much enthusiasm they were like dude Michelle why don't you just help us host?
[00:27:50.400] [SPEAKER_01]: So I started helping out with them.
[00:27:52.600] [SPEAKER_01]: So Nicole and Zai do it monthly at sports basement
[00:27:55.740] [SPEAKER_01]: and then I just help them out with marketing,
[00:27:59.960] [SPEAKER_01]: creating flyers, finding different spaces to host in, social media.
[00:28:05.220] [SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't me who started Collage Club but I'm happy to take it where it has been going.
[00:28:10.880] [SPEAKER_00]: Well that's so cool.
[00:28:11.860] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it takes a lot of courage
[00:28:14.220] [SPEAKER_00]: and honestly a lot of like dedication and your personal time to like even just help out
[00:28:19.580] [SPEAKER_00]: let alone throw and host these events.
[00:28:22.780] [SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that's very cool.
[00:28:24.480] [SPEAKER_00]: I think it's common for people to complain about not feeling a sense of community where they live
[00:28:28.920] [SPEAKER_00]: but way less common for them to actually do stuff about it.
[00:28:33.260] [SPEAKER_00]: Myself included I would yeah I think it would be hard for me to like throw stuff
[00:28:36.900] [SPEAKER_00]: so I admire that a lot.
[00:28:39.120] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah they really just did this on their own accord
[00:28:42.460] [SPEAKER_01]: like Nicole buys the glue sticks and scissors herself
[00:28:46.360] [SPEAKER_01]: to let people come and enjoy it for free
[00:28:49.500] [SPEAKER_01]: because she was just they just thought SF needed kind of like a screen less
[00:28:56.620] [SPEAKER_01]: something to do with your hands just like bring child like creativity back into people's lives.
[00:29:04.980] [SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly girlies you know it's very girl coded
[00:29:07.780] [SPEAKER_01]: or collage club and like pottery painting and stuff
[00:29:12.960] [SPEAKER_01]: and that's why I've been trying to invite more guys
[00:29:15.640] [SPEAKER_01]: because let's make collage club the next run club you know for people to meet.
[00:29:21.600] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean like guys can make pottery too
[00:29:25.280] [SPEAKER_02]: and guys can stick pictures on paper too
[00:29:28.660] [SPEAKER_00]: and it seems way easier to talk doing collaging than like running.
[00:29:33.480] [SPEAKER_01]: Totally yes no it's so chill yeah I've been trying to encourage a lot more guys to come.
[00:29:38.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Like if you change the name from collaging to like vision board creation
[00:29:43.600] [SPEAKER_02]: would that make more guys show?
[00:29:46.240] [SPEAKER_01]: You are so right yeah yeah yeah good idea Crystal.
[00:29:52.060] [SPEAKER_02]: But I love that they started it and despite like the first time
[00:29:56.260] [SPEAKER_02]: having no one come they still continued and tried and now it's like a huge thing.
[00:30:01.380] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah people come monthly we have repeat people
[00:30:04.480] [SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a big part of it too is like consistency right like having it every month
[00:30:10.380] [SPEAKER_01]: having people keep coming back and seeing the same faces and names again
[00:30:15.360] [SPEAKER_01]: where you really start to meet people and like look forward to seeing people there is huge.
[00:30:20.460] [SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point because I feel like there are a decent number of like one-off things or
[00:30:25.240] [SPEAKER_00]: events that happen where I feel like you go to it you're like oh that was so cool and
[00:30:29.160] [SPEAKER_00]: like nothing ever happens ever again so I can see how like having something consistently happen
[00:30:34.880] [SPEAKER_00]: like something you could put recurring on your calendar could actually build maybe like longer
[00:30:39.340] [SPEAKER_00]: term relationships rather than just like a one-off space for you to meet people.
[00:30:44.800] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah absolutely.
[00:30:46.360] [SPEAKER_00]: Question for you have you ever been to like a not so good event so maybe you went to an
[00:30:52.340] [SPEAKER_00]: event and it was supposed to be community building but it didn't have the results that
[00:30:57.740] [SPEAKER_00]: you were looking for.
[00:31:00.240] [SPEAKER_01]: First thing that comes to mind is like going thinking back to college again when I was trying
[00:31:04.180] [SPEAKER_01]: my fucking hardest to like make friends was going to like 10 different club meetings in a
[00:31:10.520] [SPEAKER_01]: week not like anything specifically about but I just remember going to someone being like
[00:31:15.380] [SPEAKER_01]: this ain't it like I don't remember if it was like specifically like not well organized
[00:31:22.500] [SPEAKER_01]: or maybe I don't know the people maybe you know sometimes some people aren't your people
[00:31:26.760] [SPEAKER_01]: and I remember like trying to force it being part of this club but after a few times I was
[00:31:32.080] [SPEAKER_01]: like I am not getting anything out of the relationships here I'm not getting out of
[00:31:36.700] [SPEAKER_01]: anything out of the events yeah I don't know I just remember trying to force it
[00:31:41.100] [SPEAKER_01]: in college when I was no one trying to figure out who I was.
[00:31:46.500] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have some memories of going to really awkward like apartment building events
[00:31:51.580] [SPEAKER_00]: like oh like guys we'll have free food come to the common area and get a donut and meet your
[00:31:58.240] [SPEAKER_00]: neighbors and I remember we went and then it was just like I don't know maybe something about
[00:32:04.400] [SPEAKER_00]: like it being an apartment building thing or something about like the main draw being the
[00:32:09.080] [SPEAKER_00]: free donuts or whatever but I remember we grabbed donuts stood there for like a minute
[00:32:13.740] [SPEAKER_00]: and then it was so awkward we just like left.
[00:32:17.240] [SPEAKER_02]: Hmm you know what I think I can relate to that because I think there was an event that was
[00:32:23.780] [SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be like networking or something and the hosts did try I will give them that but I
[00:32:30.960] [SPEAKER_02]: think the timing was kind of bad it was like towards the end of the day people were tired
[00:32:35.940] [SPEAKER_02]: and then they're like hey we have free like drinks and food and people just kind of went
[00:32:41.420] [SPEAKER_02]: and like grabbed the food got some drinks and then they're like I'm tired like I don't really
[00:32:46.320] [SPEAKER_02]: want to do these networking activities I'm just gonna leave so it was like half and half you
[00:32:52.360] [SPEAKER_02]: know half of the people were ready and happy to participate and then a good half were also kind
[00:32:57.680] [SPEAKER_02]: of like um I think I'm gonna go now I've come for the free stuff and that's all I needed.
[00:33:05.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's what I'm saying like to be fully immersed you have to be all in and like
[00:33:09.660] [SPEAKER_01]: really most of the just like on that's we're just not there we're just there for the free food
[00:33:16.580] [SPEAKER_01]: that reminds you of some some club meetings as well some clubs would be like we're gonna have
[00:33:22.160] [SPEAKER_01]: free food come join our club and then it was just not it yeah yeah yeah. So maybe the free
[00:33:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]: stuff is a trap. Yeah I think maybe sometimes if the free stuff is like a little too good
[00:33:34.760] [SPEAKER_02]: if the free stuff is way better than what your event content is then people will come for the
[00:33:41.980] [SPEAKER_02]: food or you know whatever free stuff it is and look around and be like yeah I'm out of here
[00:33:47.740] [SPEAKER_02]: but if it's like similar level then maybe they'll be enticed by the free stuff and
[00:33:53.460] [SPEAKER_02]: then they'll be like oh this looks interesting like you know there's a balance you have to
[00:33:57.960] [SPEAKER_02]: like popcorn or something but not donut yeah there's a line yeah exactly or maybe like the
[00:34:05.360] [SPEAKER_02]: free stuff has to be more like tied in with the event itself you know like if it's free popcorn
[00:34:12.660] [SPEAKER_02]: we're watching a movie or something right that's the real thought behind it I can
[00:34:19.060] [SPEAKER_00]: tell when it's fake like yeah I mean so Michelle now you are someone who does have
[00:34:26.500] [SPEAKER_00]: a bigger helping hand or like maybe a bigger I don't want to say responsibility but probably
[00:34:32.400] [SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of like ownership right in trying to have these events that improve the community
[00:34:37.240] [SPEAKER_00]: around you do you feel like you have any insights that you've kind of encountered
[00:34:41.960] [SPEAKER_00]: working with your friends and seeing what works what doesn't yeah there's one like
[00:34:47.500] [SPEAKER_01]: personal insight that I came to it's I get very anxious about these because they're like
[00:34:51.460] [SPEAKER_01]: and you feel like you said a huge sense of responsibility hosting I'm like maybe I can
[00:34:58.060] [SPEAKER_01]: turn this into some sort of career path for myself a step away from graphic design
[00:35:06.200] [SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know I haven't figured it out at all it's just been a thought in my head that
[00:35:10.580] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been sharing but something about working with small businesses and planning events and
[00:35:16.780] [SPEAKER_01]: on social media making content working with small business owners and just seeing people
[00:35:24.760] [SPEAKER_01]: enjoying the event itself is so fulfilling and I would love if I could take it to the next level
[00:35:31.700] [SPEAKER_01]: like all this is done for free and it's obviously done with the help of my friends
[00:35:36.640] [SPEAKER_01]: who have the supplies for collaging but if there's a way to monetize it
[00:35:42.360] [SPEAKER_01]: and there's a way to somehow make a living off of it that would be sick I think that would be
[00:35:48.960] [SPEAKER_01]: really really fulfilling and meaningful to just plan events and be there yeah that makes sense
[00:35:55.240] [SPEAKER_00]: right now it's like unpaid labor kind of you're paid and like friendship yeah yeah and it's still
[00:36:00.680] [SPEAKER_01]: like so meaningful but obviously it takes a lot of time and if I could just like step away
[00:36:08.160] [SPEAKER_01]: from my day job to be able to do this you're like begging for a reason yeah I really am I would
[00:36:15.640] [SPEAKER_01]: love that if this could get if this gets bigger and bigger like for me to just do it
[00:36:22.740] [SPEAKER_01]: and I guess another insight it's like you really have to show up and really like we
[00:36:31.000] [SPEAKER_01]: we like we talked about in the beginning like and really put yourself out there to talk to
[00:36:34.140] [SPEAKER_01]: new people I've talked to a lot of people just through like the creative spaces and sf or through
[00:36:41.740] [SPEAKER_01]: instagram or something there's a lot of opportunity when I talk to and meet new people
[00:36:47.500] [SPEAKER_01]: and I just haven't acted on all those opportunities yet because you know it takes
[00:36:52.720] [SPEAKER_01]: a lot of time and effort dedication and brain space and everything that I don't have because
[00:36:58.540] [SPEAKER_01]: of being an adult but there's like a lot of opportunities out there to build community
[00:37:03.900] [SPEAKER_02]: and I just need to take them I just need to reach out to them yeah and kind of tie it back
[00:37:09.180] [SPEAKER_02]: to what we just talked about like in terms of detracting from communities I feel like if you're
[00:37:15.160] [SPEAKER_02]: not fully invested and people can like see through your facade then that also detracts from
[00:37:21.820] [SPEAKER_02]: you know the community vibe if people are like hey I wanted to come here to talk about
[00:37:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]: collaging and pottery but clearly the host doesn't give a shit then like why would they come back
[00:37:34.760] [SPEAKER_01]: right and that's where it takes all the energy out of me is being usually a lot of these events
[00:37:42.260] [SPEAKER_01]: I host are like around dinnertime and I'm not eating dinner because I am locked in
[00:37:48.000] [SPEAKER_01]: and I have to like I don't know I'm a really hangry person as well so to have to like to
[00:37:54.220] [SPEAKER_01]: my angry demon and be like hi welcome like what are you doing today are you new on
[00:38:01.100] [SPEAKER_01]: pin potter and you want to collage well things are here and you can do this and then
[00:38:06.060] [SPEAKER_01]: I have to answer questions and be like uh again like I said play really enthusiastic host is
[00:38:12.640] [SPEAKER_02]: hard but it gets people in dude maybe the move is to the next step is make it into a potluck
[00:38:20.240] [SPEAKER_02]: everyone needs to bring their dish totally true me Nicole and I have been brainstorming a ton
[00:38:26.460] [SPEAKER_01]: about like different themes we can do for the lodge club like next month is October maybe we
[00:38:32.980] [SPEAKER_01]: can do like a costume swap or something maybe we can do like a puzzle swap a clothing swap a
[00:38:40.720] [SPEAKER_01]: lot of swaps but just like have more themes and a dinner swap yes yes potluck yeah yeah
[00:38:47.300] [SPEAKER_01]: food swap yeah stuff like that just to add more complexity to collage I think it's so funny
[00:38:56.000] [SPEAKER_00]: because we kind of talked about how when you go to community events you kind of have to like
[00:39:00.140] [SPEAKER_00]: show up and be on and sounds like it's doubly or triply so for the host there's something so
[00:39:07.360] [SPEAKER_00]: like cute about imagining all these people in one room like so eager and happy and like
[00:39:13.900] [SPEAKER_00]: put themselves out there matching everyone's energy to like max like that's so it's like
[00:39:20.020] [SPEAKER_01]: heartwarming you know yes I co-hosted with a friend of mine named Sharon she's a huge
[00:39:25.440] [SPEAKER_01]: community builder too she hosts a lot of events and does really cool projects we did
[00:39:29.760] [SPEAKER_01]: Maj and collage we paired with Sharon and the Majong project just to get the game out
[00:39:36.680] [SPEAKER_01]: there and have more people learn so we did collage on one side and then Majong games on
[00:39:41.240] [SPEAKER_01]: the other side we had like five tables set up and yeah it's like collage you can kind of sit
[00:39:46.900] [SPEAKER_01]: by yourself in collage Majong you have to play with three other people yeah the enthusiasm was
[00:39:52.820] [SPEAKER_01]: amazing it was like strangers literally sitting down together to learn and play Majong and it
[00:39:59.820] [SPEAKER_00]: was so cute kind of reminds me of like those board game nights that I feel like a lot of
[00:40:04.840] [SPEAKER_00]: board game stores host as well sometimes when I pop by one to grab a game like Tuesday
[00:40:09.640] [SPEAKER_00]: nights or something at our local one there's like tables and tables of people playing
[00:40:14.180] [SPEAKER_00]: whatever game they're playing and I'm always like oh my god we live in a real city yeah
[00:40:18.680] [SPEAKER_01]: like this is like the people I live around totally yeah I think like we said right just
[00:40:25.140] [SPEAKER_02]: take the opportunities and show up I mean kind of tying back to like you talking about
[00:40:32.220] [SPEAKER_02]: the run club I never knew run club was like that I always thought that you just show up
[00:40:37.580] [SPEAKER_02]: run whatever miles you finish and then you go home so I was like dude what's the deal with
[00:40:42.620] [SPEAKER_02]: run club how are people even dating are they just like huffing and puffing trying to talk
[00:40:47.120] [SPEAKER_02]: while they're running but the way you described it I'm like oh okay I can totally see now how
[00:40:52.000] [SPEAKER_02]: that is community building meeting new people and like having fun not just running yeah no I
[00:40:59.220] [SPEAKER_01]: don't enjoy running at all but I had a lot of fun these past few times and I like will
[00:41:04.300] [SPEAKER_01]: look forward to it it's just not that I like again I didn't meet anyone I don't remember
[00:41:08.840] [SPEAKER_01]: anyone's names from run club but just the idea that we're all running together
[00:41:14.720] [SPEAKER_01]: through beautiful parts of the city and then hanging out a little bit after
[00:41:18.280] [SPEAKER_00]: is really really nice I feel like a lot of this is very necessary too to feel like a
[00:41:24.100] [SPEAKER_00]: real person a part of a real society especially in like the online era where sometimes I feel
[00:41:29.980] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I spend an egregious amount of hours every day looking at a screen so just not
[00:41:36.580] [SPEAKER_00]: doing that and seeing people around me who aren't necessarily like close friends
[00:41:40.600] [SPEAKER_00]: is rewarding and getting a little bit like rare and rare unless you put in your own time
[00:41:45.640] [SPEAKER_00]: so yes a lot of it is about like building and feeling the community but I think a lot
[00:41:50.780] [SPEAKER_00]: of it is really good for just ourselves as individuals too okay but I have a question for
[00:41:55.840] [SPEAKER_02]: because I'm an introvert so like if I were to go to an event and I'm trying to meet new people
[00:42:04.460] [SPEAKER_02]: and you know connect through some sort of common hobby but I feel like there's so many people
[00:42:12.080] [SPEAKER_02]: and maybe they all already know each other like what should I do Crystal the thing is
[00:42:17.320] [SPEAKER_01]: love to chat Crystal is a yapper like once you get Crystal on one topic she can she can go off
[00:42:25.900] [SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it happen multiple times so I know the initial like reach out is really hard but
[00:42:33.220] [SPEAKER_01]: even I find as an extrovert I'm not even usually the one who reaches out at makes the
[00:42:38.520] [SPEAKER_01]: initial contact there are always more extroverted people there's always a more extroverted person
[00:42:43.240] [SPEAKER_01]: in the room who will do the initial contact and like do the bringing in of someone so I don't
[00:42:50.040] [SPEAKER_01]: know if it's like waiting or kind of wandering around until you find that ultra extrovert to
[00:42:57.360] [SPEAKER_01]: bring you in I don't know Crystal I feel like once someone introduces you themselves to you
[00:43:03.180] [SPEAKER_01]: like you can find a topic easily to connect on that's true I can yap I'm capable of it
[00:43:09.840] [SPEAKER_01]: but you know initial contact is hard but yeah no even same as an extrovert speaking just
[00:43:16.620] [SPEAKER_02]: wait for the more extroverted I guess the best scenario would be like the host themselves come
[00:43:24.020] [SPEAKER_02]: over and they're like oh my god this poor introvert over here has no one to yeah yes sir I think
[00:43:28.980] [SPEAKER_01]: that's the biggest I know I mentioned that welcoming people and telling people to sign in on
[00:43:33.960] [SPEAKER_01]: the sign-in sheet is the main job but you're right the hosting is actually like I flip around
[00:43:39.080] [SPEAKER_01]: and I'm just like you like fruit I heard some fruit talk right over here too like yeah you're
[00:43:47.900] [SPEAKER_01]: exactly right it's like trying to engage everyone yeah that is the most honestly
[00:43:54.540] [SPEAKER_01]: exhausting part you're so right hosts is so important in doing that I'm like imagining
[00:44:00.400] [SPEAKER_02]: you with a mental map you're like okay like fruit talk is over here and like fashion talk
[00:44:05.520] [SPEAKER_02]: down here like you're like okay who do I move to this section and yeah yeah or I'm like are you
[00:44:13.420] [SPEAKER_01]: single that person's single too I'm trying to matchmake too I'm working overtime you guys
[00:44:17.680] [SPEAKER_01]: yeah or I'm like your collage looks reminiscent of this like yeah yeah yeah totally oh my god
[00:44:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]: that sounds exhausting it is but also Jisoo loves to matchmake Jisoo me too oh my gosh
[00:44:33.860] [SPEAKER_00]: get together and matchmake all our single friends we should host like a singles night
[00:44:38.880] [SPEAKER_02]: you and I can be hosts wow you guys should host like a like a speed dating night of all
[00:44:46.320] [SPEAKER_01]: our single friends eat your crust times collage club eat your collage club eycc singles night
[00:44:54.420] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah this is amazing yeah but I guess going back to the question of like as an introvert
[00:45:02.100] [SPEAKER_00]: do you show up and talk like as a shy extrovert I feel like I also feel very similar things
[00:45:08.240] [SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like a really easy go-to one is like you just have to look for either one someone who
[00:45:13.060] [SPEAKER_00]: looks also shy and like chat them up like oh my god isn't this awkward and like you know try
[00:45:18.300] [SPEAKER_00]: to get into a conversation or go up to someone who's like holding something or like doing
[00:45:23.300] [SPEAKER_00]: something be like oh like what is that blah blah so maybe to lessen the burden of the
[00:45:32.080] [SPEAKER_02]: self-service options yes we need to take actions ourselves
[00:45:38.180] [SPEAKER_00]: but honestly this is like very encouraging I think it's very cool to know people who actually
[00:45:44.540] [SPEAKER_00]: host these kinds of events too and sometimes I've been thinking about it but even in my
[00:45:50.200] [SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood sometimes people will put out like a box of lemons or something because they
[00:45:55.440] [SPEAKER_00]: can't eat all the lemons on their tree so it'll say like feel free to take some lemons
[00:45:59.920] [SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like yeah even small stuff like that that takes like very minimal effort can also feel
[00:46:05.980] [SPEAKER_01]: community building it's so funny that you say that because I have like a bunch of stuff in
[00:46:10.320] [SPEAKER_01]: my head that I was going to bring downstairs to the lobby with a free sign because I saw
[00:46:15.400] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been seeing other people doing it I'm like you're so right it does bring a sense of
[00:46:19.800] [SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah people live here in my building yeah so then I feel like there's big stuff you can do
[00:46:27.440] [SPEAKER_01]: and small stuff totally you're right there's like mini-school things that we can put out there
[00:46:33.460] [SPEAKER_01]: to let other humans know that we're alive and breathing all the way to you know the big things
[00:46:39.560] [SPEAKER_01]: like hosting and then maybe making a career out of being a community builder but all are
[00:46:46.540] [SPEAKER_02]: so appreciated I feel like by fellow humans for sure and I think honestly after COVID we're
[00:46:54.840] [SPEAKER_02]: still kind of like working our way back up to making connections and finding our footing again
[00:47:01.400] [SPEAKER_02]: with you know the community around us local events and just feeling that connection so
[00:47:07.900] [SPEAKER_02]: now I think is a really good time to start thinking about like putting yourself out there
[00:47:13.120] [SPEAKER_02]: joining some sort of run club or rec league or whatever and I'm really glad we talked about
[00:47:20.960] [SPEAKER_02]: this today I think it does feel very encouraging to hear about like the different events that
[00:47:25.800] [SPEAKER_02]: you've been hosting and attending Michelle and I might just uh you know look up some run clubs
