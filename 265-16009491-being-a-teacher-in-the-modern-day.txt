[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Hannah.
[00:00:16.880] Welcome Hannah to the podcast. Hannah is an old friend of mine from high school and now Hannah
[00:00:24.880] herself is a teacher. So we thought it would be really, really interesting to bring Hannah on and
[00:00:31.320] talk about her new and expanded perspective of school. I feel like it's such an interesting time
[00:00:39.820] too because over the course of this year, I've kind of talked about how I sometimes don't feel like an
[00:00:46.080] adult. I don't know what I'm doing or where I am. And I feel like looking back and reflecting,
[00:00:52.640] comparing yourself back to when we were in high school or even college, it really does show how
[00:00:58.580] much you've grown. And I feel like Hannah, you see these like high school kids every day. And so it's
[00:01:04.980] really an eye opener for you, I'm sure to like see how different or maybe even similar you all can be.
[00:01:11.880] So we're really excited to have you on. And I guess to kind of get the ball rolling,
[00:01:18.980] how would you describe your experience of being a teacher? Just like overall in general?
[00:01:24.740] Well, I'm now in my sixth year of teaching high school English. And I would kind of describe the
[00:01:31.960] experience, I guess like in three words, I would consider it very fulfilling, humbling, and also
[00:01:37.620] challenging. And it does feel kind of insane to like say in my own words, I've been a teacher for
[00:01:44.760] six years now, especially because my first year was 2019 to 2020. And so that was such a chaotic year
[00:01:52.700] because we entered a global pandemic and we had online learning and then we had hybrid learning.
[00:01:59.080] And then we had fully back in person learning. I low-key don't remember maybe the first three years.
[00:02:06.680] Like I remember moments and like snippets, but a lot of it's kind of a blur. And sometimes I don't
[00:02:12.900] even remember like my students' faces from those years because we had to wear masks too. And so that
[00:02:17.900] just feels like a completely different part of my life. It's a huge 180 from like the kind of teaching
[00:02:24.440] experience that I have now. And yeah. So then when the pandemic ended and we were back in real life
[00:02:31.280] learning, I guess, did you feel like you had to relearn how to be a teacher in some senses?
[00:02:37.080] I don't know if I felt like I had to relearn being a teacher, but there are just so many more
[00:02:41.660] variables and factors coming into play. I mostly taught underclassmen my first couple years. So I
[00:02:47.980] always taught freshmen and now I teach juniors and seniors, but I just remember the first like year
[00:02:55.840] in person. We had no online learning, no hybrid model. I just remember my freshmen being so socially
[00:03:03.600] immature and also just like very deprived. They were like online and at home in like middle school,
[00:03:11.880] et cetera. And so they didn't really have like that middle school experience. And so they very much had
[00:03:17.020] middle school energy, which is not what I signed up for. So it was just like super chaotic. Students,
[00:03:24.260] they would get really close and then they would get into fights really easily. They would like break
[00:03:28.860] friendships like left and right because it's just so much all at once. It was just hard for them to
[00:03:35.300] like kind of come back into learning. And also high school is just so different from middle school,
[00:03:41.280] which they kind of missed out on. But I just remember it just felt very chaotic. And like as a
[00:03:46.840] teacher, you have to make all of these decisions so quickly at a split second, like you're trying to do
[00:03:52.640] a lesson and then some kid in the corner is not paying attention or like another kid is saying
[00:03:58.080] something like out of pocket shit. And you're like, okay, well now like, I'm like, we don't do that.
[00:04:03.220] That's not the culture. That's not the norm. Or like if they don't act right, I'm like, go outside.
[00:04:08.760] And it's just like all these things. Sometimes I'll get a phone call and be like,
[00:04:11.780] oh, so-and-so's parents here to pick them up. I'm like, okay, you can go. Anyways.
[00:04:20.320] So it's just like so much all at once. First two years, I think being fully back in person after
[00:04:26.940] a pandemic were probably the roughest years. And I think nationwide, our principal was sharing how
[00:04:33.020] you were seeing a lot of it across the nation, like more fights, just more like behavioral issues,
[00:04:38.020] etc. Low scores all around. Dude, isn't it hard to establish authority as a teacher when you yourself
[00:04:47.160] are so young? Because I'm thinking, especially 2019, 2020, you were probably like just out of undergrad.
[00:04:54.740] And being so close in age to your students, I'm sure could pose a little bit of difficulty or maybe
[00:05:00.860] like nuance that you have to navigate. You know, I thought that was my fear when I first started
[00:05:05.040] teaching. But because I started teaching when I was like 23, essentially 22, 23. I remember having
[00:05:12.520] that fear of like, oh, well, the students don't respect me, etc. Will it be hard to establish
[00:05:16.560] authority? But at the end of the day, you could be the smartest kid. I'm still smarter than you.
[00:05:23.040] Like, I'm still the adult in the room that is responsible for you. And like, even though I'm
[00:05:29.320] young, you feel that gap with the students, even with like seniors, granted, I am a bit like older
[00:05:36.220] now in my late 20s. And I teach juniors and seniors. But when you're in the classroom, and you interact
[00:05:43.200] with the students, I think it's very, I don't want to say easy. But I feel like if you are very secure in
[00:05:50.000] yourself as a teacher, and you don't seek your students validation, it's actually much easier.
[00:05:56.920] It comes naturally, I think, to establish authority and to kind of command respect, because the students
[00:06:03.860] will know. They can gauge and they'll kind of try to push their boundaries a little bit to see how much
[00:06:10.440] you're willing to take how much you're willing to let by. But I think as a teacher, if you're holding
[00:06:15.400] yourself to a high standard, and you hold your students to a high standard, they will recognize
[00:06:21.120] your authority and respect you. Yeah. And I think for me, I also respect my students,
[00:06:26.500] like I always greet my students, or I try to. Sometimes there's something that needs to be done in
[00:06:31.740] between passing periods. But I will always try to greet my students at the door. And I take them
[00:06:36.380] seriously. And I hold them to high standards. And I think they recognize that. And not every student is
[00:06:42.020] going to like you. And that's totally fine, because I don't need my students to like me. I do know that my
[00:06:47.340] students like me. But I don't need them to, to understand that I'm still good at what I do. And I have their
[00:06:55.180] best interests at heart. And so I think at the end of the day, that's reciprocated.
[00:06:59.820] I think that makes sense to what you said earlier, no matter how smart the smartest kid is,
[00:07:04.840] you are still going to be smarter, like more mature, have just lived more life experiences. And I feel
[00:07:13.180] like once you said that out loud, it totally makes a lot of sense. Teenagers just think they're the best
[00:07:18.560] all the time. But like, they're not. And I don't say that to like undermine any of them in any way,
[00:07:25.520] their intellect or their capacity to be really smart. It's just that like, I am the adult in the room.
[00:07:32.100] And I had different expectations and rules and responsibilities than you do as a student.
[00:07:37.720] Right. And so we're not the same.
[00:07:39.680] Yeah.
[00:07:41.880] It's also crazy to think that certain things that you do as a teacher were things that my teachers
[00:07:47.700] also did, which is like stand at the door and like say hi to people. Or I think we also had some
[00:07:52.780] students who would insist on certain things like calling people by their last name, you know,
[00:07:57.640] like Miss Kim or whatever. And it's crazy to think that these are all like stylistic choices
[00:08:02.320] that are made by the teacher instead of just the way things are. Because I don't think I really
[00:08:07.520] recognize that as a student. I was just like, Oh, this teacher's is that but looking back,
[00:08:11.920] all of it was individual choices that the teachers made.
[00:08:15.640] Very much so. And they're like every teacher has their own style. And it does kind of range
[00:08:21.320] depending on like your experience, how long you've been at the school site, etc.
[00:08:26.400] Are there individual choices that you make for your appearance as well? So something I saw on TikTok
[00:08:33.100] recently was like, I'm a teacher who is fairly young. So like kind of close in age with
[00:08:37.520] my students. So therefore I try to dress more mature or in like a specific way to command
[00:08:43.320] like a certain vibe.
[00:08:45.480] That's so funny, because I, I just wear what I want. That is still like work appropriate.
[00:08:53.200] I am tenured at my school site. And so it's nice to have that job security. It does kind
[00:08:59.500] of make a difference in how you feel comfortable with just yourself and like in that space or at
[00:09:06.300] that school site. I just wear what I want. That makes me feel good. And that is still professional,
[00:09:12.460] but still my own style. So my students love my fits.
[00:09:18.760] That's so cute.
[00:09:20.180] They like tell me pretty frequently, they're like, I love your fit today, Miss Lee.
[00:09:24.520] Oh my god.
[00:09:25.600] That's so cute.
[00:09:26.420] Thank you.
[00:09:27.900] No, yeah. So I think I actually do just pretty casually sometimes. So there's some days where
[00:09:34.200] I dress pretty professional with like a dress pants, etc. I'm drinking like Aritzia has really
[00:09:39.000] good professional basics. I will wear jeans, I will wear cargo pants, I will wear what I feel
[00:09:45.200] comfortable in. I'm like five too. So I wear heels a lot pretty much almost every day. But once it gets
[00:09:51.160] cold, I'm wearing my sneakers, I'm wearing my Adidas tambas or whatever. On the days that I dress pretty
[00:09:59.180] casually, you know, my admin, my colleagues have seen the way I dress too. It's never really been an
[00:10:05.300] issue because I think it's like my way of expressing myself. But also, I still command respect and I have
[00:10:12.480] authority in my classroom. I think if anything kind of helps for the students to see that like,
[00:10:17.200] oh, I have my own style. And I can work my own style. Instead of trying to like fit in or try to
[00:10:24.800] seem too business professional, etc. Because like, I'm in my classroom all day. And so part of me
[00:10:32.620] preparing for the school day is also feeling good about myself. And so what I wear kind of helps.
[00:10:38.060] That makes a lot of sense. And you're probably like getting up and walking around a lot too. So you
[00:10:42.340] want to be comfortable. I feel like if I had a teacher who dressed pretty casual or like had cool
[00:10:49.700] fits, I would respect them more because I'd be like, damn, this teacher is hella cool.
[00:10:54.680] I do think I'd give that vibe.
[00:10:56.460] Yeah, I could totally see it. And I feel like kind of what we were talking about earlier,
[00:11:02.180] the question of like commanding authority, even though you're a little closer to age to these
[00:11:07.060] youngsters. I feel like when I was in high school, if I had a young teacher, I thought they were
[00:11:12.100] automatically cooler.
[00:11:14.060] Yeah, that's a privilege you have as like a young teacher. And I think it's going to capitalize on it.
[00:11:19.620] Yeah. I wonder if you ever set trends in your classroom, though.
[00:11:25.860] Like trends?
[00:11:27.040] Yeah, you're like students are like, Oh my god, Miss Lee's shoes are so sick. Maybe I should get a pair.
[00:11:34.160] When my friend went to Japan last year, I asked her to get me the Onitsuka Tigers, the yellow ones.
[00:11:39.360] So whenever I wear those, my students are like, Oh, nice shoes. And like even my colleagues,
[00:11:44.140] like my older colleagues, they're like, Oh, nice shoes.
[00:11:48.660] I don't know about trends, but I do have colleagues that I'm really close with. And I'm
[00:11:55.660] really close with my colleague who was my mentor teacher when I was a student teacher at my site.
[00:12:00.800] We've also recently hired a lot of newer, younger teachers. There are two other female teachers that
[00:12:06.560] I'm really close with. We went to the football game last night for a senior night. We saw some
[00:12:11.640] of our students are like, Oh, it's the three musceteers. Oh my god.
[00:12:15.920] And like they know. Yeah. I don't know about like trends, but they know like our patterns.
[00:12:21.360] Oh my god.
[00:12:22.220] At school. Because sometimes I will come in, I have like a prep period. So that's like a period where
[00:12:28.760] you don't teach essentially and like you prep. And so sometimes during my prep period, I'll drop
[00:12:34.000] off coffee for some of them. And like the students like, Oh, Miss Lee, brought coffee again.
[00:12:41.950] Oh my god. That's so cute.
[00:12:44.010] Yeah. So I don't know if we like set trends, but we definitely when you're at school every day,
[00:12:50.080] right? And you're interacting with students and interacting with your colleagues. I think
[00:12:54.610] they definitely recognize patterns. I mean, students just see so much like I'm thinking back
[00:13:00.770] to my high school days. And I don't know if we necessarily dissected people's fashion. But we
[00:13:07.490] definitely talked about things like this person tends to be like a really happy teacher or like this person
[00:13:14.290] presumably might have things going on at home because he's so angry all the time. Like there's
[00:13:19.070] all this student gossip that I feel like gets around just because your students are like staring at
[00:13:24.170] teachers for eight hours every single day.
[00:13:27.090] Mm hmm. You know, students are, they're very observant. And they will know. Like there's like
[00:13:33.950] one day I was just, I was just tired. And I try not to share it too much. But sometimes it's just hard.
[00:13:40.270] And he's like, Miss Lee, you good? I was like, respectfully, no.
[00:13:45.730] Being in me is especially good today.
[00:13:49.550] You're like, we're just gonna watch a movie today.
[00:13:53.570] Oh my god, but are you ever at work and you're like hungover?
[00:13:58.850] Yeah.
[00:14:01.910] I'm not gonna deny that, you know, that that has never occurred before. But it's definitely rare.
[00:14:10.350] Yeah.
[00:14:11.870] And I tried not to be hungover at work. I think it's just more on a rare occasion where if we have
[00:14:18.470] something on a Sunday night, or like maybe we had a little too much fun at our happy hour.
[00:14:25.930] I remember maybe like two times I was like, pretty hungover the next day. And it was like a work day.
[00:14:31.410] And I was like, I'm never doing this again. And I just try not to.
[00:14:36.410] Yeah.
[00:14:36.590] Yeah.
[00:14:36.910] Because it's just rough.
[00:14:38.610] Yeah, I'm sure. And I guess it's like similar to like our jobs. I mean, me personally, I also
[00:14:44.490] try not to be hungover at work. But I do think I get the benefit of if I am really hungover,
[00:14:50.750] and I'm at work, I could just try to move all my meetings. But like teaching is unavoidable.
[00:14:55.790] Right?
[00:14:56.630] Yeah. And so life just like presents opportunities for you. You gotta take them. But I don't try to like,
[00:15:05.450] be like, Oh, it'll be okay. Like, etc. It's just more like sometimes like, something spontaneous
[00:15:10.490] happens. And the next day, I'm like, I'm paying for it. We'll not do that again. And that very like
[00:15:17.170] rarely happens. I would say I've been hungover at work, maybe less than a handful of times. But I
[00:15:22.730] also think it's a little unrealistic to be like, Oh, that's so unprofessional. You should never I'm like,
[00:15:27.390] shut the fuck up. Everyone has had a day. Yeah. Yeah, like you could have a day and not even be
[00:15:34.890] hungover. True. Well, I do want to ask you this. So now that you have several years of experience being
[00:15:43.050] a teacher, is there anything that you look at differently? With having this teacher experience
[00:15:49.450] behind you where you look back at your own memories with school? And you're like, damn,
[00:15:53.050] like, that's crazy. Now that I have all this expertise. It is eye opening. I think just like
[00:16:00.450] as you get older, things start to kind of shift or your perspective shift. And as a teacher and as like
[00:16:07.570] the responsible adult of your classroom, there are definitely a couple things that make me realize
[00:16:13.250] like, Oh, I kind of have a bit more insight as like why things are the way they should be. When we were
[00:16:20.210] in school, like when I was a high school student, I just remember, you know, sometimes you finish a lesson
[00:16:25.210] early. And you maybe have like a couple minutes left. And I'd be like, Oh, why can't they just let us
[00:16:30.430] leave a couple minutes early, especially at the end of the day, or maybe like on a Friday, I'm about to go
[00:16:36.950] off into the weekend. And from like a teacher perspective, if I were to let my students theoretically
[00:16:44.430] leave a couple minutes early, but then something happens to them, let's say like, and my classroom
[00:16:50.530] in particular is pretty close to a parking lot. So let's say like, I don't know, they get hit by a car
[00:16:55.370] or something, I would be the one that's held responsible, or I would have liability in that
[00:17:01.110] because I was supposed to keep them in until the bell rang and dismiss them. And I was like,
[00:17:06.830] I'm not about to legally help or anything that happened, you know, on my contracted time. And so
[00:17:14.710] things like that have definitely shifted. My colleagues and I, we went to the senior night
[00:17:19.790] football game. And ASB and the students are trying to show my school spirit, they're having a lot of fun
[00:17:26.410] and cheering. And then they popped off these like colored powders. And I was like, Oh my god,
[00:17:31.750] it's so cool. Like me and my colleagues were like, wow, that looks so cool. The ASB teacher was like
[00:17:37.190] going off on them because they they know that you're not allowed to use those materials or
[00:17:44.870] use this kind of poppers, etc. at sporting events, which I had no idea. Their reasoning is because like,
[00:17:51.530] oh, it's not safe. Some students may not consent to having that powder on them. You don't know like
[00:17:57.490] their health needs, their allergies. And I do think that maybe a couple years ago, some kind of
[00:18:03.230] incident where like a powder got on a student's eye and they had an infection. And then that can lead
[00:18:08.170] to like, parents potentially wanting to sue the school. And so it's just like, okay, we cannot have
[00:18:13.890] that anymore. Right. And so things like that, I'm like, okay, I, there's a lot of like legal liability.
[00:18:21.790] And as a student, you're just thinking, Oh, it's like harmless. It's not a big deal.
[00:18:25.650] But as an adult, it's very different. And especially like for the school and the district,
[00:18:31.870] because parents have that power to sue, or really anyone has a part of zoom, right? And so it's
[00:18:38.350] about preventing those accidents that could potentially come out of like those even just
[00:18:44.390] like fun, silly events. Oh, my God, this is like a prime example, I think of having a frontal
[00:18:51.230] lobe. So ever since this year, I've kind of been obsessed with my frontal lobe, because I know it's
[00:18:57.670] developed now. And I've like talked about it with some friends. It's like, Oh, yeah, we just like we
[00:19:04.190] have more anxiety. Now we like care, we know the consequences of things now versus when we were
[00:19:09.450] younger, we were only thinking of the like, right now, like what is happening, not the like, you know,
[00:19:15.330] further down the line, what are the consequences? What are the accidents that could be happening? Or,
[00:19:19.910] you know, as you said, like legal liabilities, or people around you getting hurt. And so I'm like,
[00:19:25.030] Oh, my God, this is definitely a prime example of like you having your frontal lobe and the students
[00:19:30.150] not.
[00:19:31.830] Yeah. I think it's just like when you're young, and you're at that age, it's easier to
[00:19:38.650] put yourself first. And just, you know, live in a moment. And that's, you know, kind of the
[00:19:44.310] romanticism of our youth. Right. But I think like you said, like, once you're like prefrontal
[00:19:49.610] cortex, or like your frontal lobe is like fully developed, you're just like, damn, I'm I get
[00:19:55.170] it now. Like, I understand. I think that's why your mid 20s. This is my hot take. Your
[00:20:01.430] mid 20s are like, not as fun of a time. As like, I don't know, entertainment and media
[00:20:08.110] has portrayed it to be. Because that's when your brain is like developing. I felt like I
[00:20:12.110] was going to a crisis.
[00:20:13.090] Dude, for sure. For sure. And like, when we're 25, I feel like that was when we're like in
[00:20:18.390] the pandemic, especially. Yeah. And so I was like, Oh, my God, pandemic, your brain is
[00:20:23.490] really developing.
[00:20:26.090] We got stunted.
[00:20:29.070] It was just so much all at once.
[00:20:30.990] Yeah. I do want to ask, though, because you said the students are pretty aware, and they
[00:20:37.690] notice like your patterns, and they've kind of noticed that you're close to, you know,
[00:20:42.830] those other two teachers. So do you notice a lot of the student drama that's going on?
[00:20:49.030] Who's in a fight? Who's like beefing? And who's like suddenly not friends anymore? Because
[00:20:55.470] there was a drama or like, maybe people are dating and there's like dating drama to like
[00:20:59.950] all of that kind of stuff.
[00:21:01.250] Oh, my God, it is just so high school. I, as I said before, students are very observant,
[00:21:10.430] but so are teachers. And it's like always super funny. But you could just tell when a student's
[00:21:15.150] like on their phone or has their Chromebook open, and you know, they're not doing their
[00:21:19.630] work. And how do you know? I'm like, it's pretty obvious. But also, we're like observing
[00:21:25.190] you guys, there is always something happening with our students. People have crushes, they
[00:21:33.370] have beef. I had a group of students who were so close at the beginning of the year. And
[00:21:39.470] then like a month into school, they got to major beef with each other. And I was like,
[00:21:44.230] what in the world? I was like, what was what's the switch up? They will tell me they will
[00:21:49.850] share with me. And I'm just like, Oh, that's so yeah, I remember like going through things
[00:21:54.850] like that in high school. But you see all the time, like I've seen really close friends
[00:22:00.430] just like all of a sudden stop talking. Or like they request like a seating change. That's
[00:22:05.970] when it's like really bad.
[00:22:07.370] That's juicy.
[00:22:08.470] And I was like, Oh, okay. And then they're like, it's because like, sometimes I don't even
[00:22:13.350] have to ask. They'll just like tell me. That's so funny. But yeah, it's it. There's
[00:22:18.830] so much drama. Sometimes there's just so much tea. And I tell my students at the beginning
[00:22:22.870] of the year because I do like a little intro of myself. I remember on my slideshow, I was
[00:22:27.770] like, these are a couple things that I love. And if you love them too, great. We'll vibe
[00:22:31.630] if not, it's okay. I remember I put like tea because I don't drink coffee. I drink like
[00:22:37.450] matcha and like I'll drink like yerba mates. My students know I love a yerba mate. And I
[00:22:43.870] like said, I love literal tea and metaphoric tea. You have any tea to tell me, please let me
[00:22:50.810] know. And it's your secret safe with me. So somebody tell me this stuff. And it's just
[00:22:55.570] so like, I'm like, Oh my God. Sometimes I'm like, I shouldn't have said that. Because sometimes
[00:23:02.670] like, it can be not stressful, but it's like, Oh, but my heart hurts for them. You know,
[00:23:07.390] when they're going through it. If they request a seating change. Oh, that's, it's crazy. But
[00:23:13.390] sometimes they turn around, like maybe at the end of the semester, they're like, Oh,
[00:23:18.030] yeah, we're besties again. I'm like, I'm like, great.
[00:23:23.490] What a roller coaster. I know. That sounds so fun, honestly, like being up to date with
[00:23:29.050] the student goss because there's no gossip, like high school gossip. Like that's when
[00:23:33.010] gossip peaks. Oh, so much. And I think gossip is powerful. And that's not to say like, I
[00:23:39.810] don't believe in like spreading rumors and like all these things. I'm like trying to put
[00:23:43.910] a person down. But I think gossip. It's a tool that women have used through years. It's
[00:23:52.150] a way to protect ourselves and also gain knowledge. And you know what? I'm all for it. Obviously,
[00:24:01.410] certain parts where I'm like, okay, that's not something you should be sharing with me. Or
[00:24:06.250] it's just like, you're being a bully right now. And I will be honest with my students.
[00:24:11.290] When it gets to that point, I'm pretty honest and I try to redirect them. Like that's not,
[00:24:15.990] I think the intention. Right. But other times it's like kind of silly or it's like harmless
[00:24:21.050] or I'm just like, Oh, it's just high school. Yeah. You know, it's kind of like a rite of passage
[00:24:27.590] for you to go through these trials and tribulations. Right. I feel like knowing that you are so in
[00:24:35.750] tune with the student gossip just makes me think that you're super in tune with like the school
[00:24:40.330] overall. Like you're really, you know what's going on and you're even like helping guide these
[00:24:46.670] kids in the right direction when you can in like not just academics, but also in, you know, conflict,
[00:24:52.910] which I feel like is really valuable. And I think just like with any person, like we all need like
[00:24:59.690] social emotional support. A lot of times they are looking to just be heard. Other times you can
[00:25:06.410] gauge where like, Oh, I think they want some guidance. And that's where it's really important.
[00:25:11.910] I think as teachers to not just be in tune with our students, but like you said, with our community.
[00:25:17.590] And so I make it a point because we're all on the same team. We're all in the same community trying
[00:25:23.210] to like support our students and support each other too. Cause teaching can be really hard or it
[00:25:28.170] can be exhausting, I think. And so it's a point to like understand that you're all on the same side.
[00:25:33.550] And so I do my best to like get to know like my colleagues, know the counseling department,
[00:25:40.130] know our admin. And I do think that takes some time. Some people are just naturally really
[00:25:44.810] more extroverted. I don't really think that was like a big priority for me. My first,
[00:25:51.170] like two years of being at the site, cause you don't even know if you're going to be there anymore,
[00:25:54.710] right after a year. Cause when you first start your attempt teacher, so your contract is done
[00:26:00.030] when the school year is done. I think that's not always like on the forefront of a lot of like new
[00:26:05.070] teachers minds to like get to know the community, but it's super important knowing your custodial
[00:26:10.350] staff, knowing like the security team, trying to know someone from like each department because a
[00:26:16.650] lot of times you meet them in passing. And so it's hard to have not like meaningful, but like more
[00:26:22.330] in-depth conversations with them. And so when you have an opportunity, it's like really important to
[00:26:28.510] take that opportunity to get to know one another. I think once you do, you feel like you're building
[00:26:33.670] community at your site and you also know you have each other's backs. Like I'm close with our
[00:26:39.350] counselors. I know our custodial staff really well and know our security team. And that also,
[00:26:46.930] I think positively impacts your students. Like they will know other students as well. You probably
[00:26:52.430] share a lot of your same students together. If I have like, Oh, maybe I think maybe some,
[00:26:58.930] this student's going through something, then like I can loop counseling in as well.
[00:27:03.170] Have some conversations on how we could support them. But I think as you shared, it's super
[00:27:08.650] important to be in tune with your students, but also be in tune with the overall community. And I
[00:27:13.150] think the longer you're in teaching, the more you crave that because as much as I love my students,
[00:27:20.190] because I'm interacting with my students all day, I crave adult communication. Like I have to talk to
[00:27:27.910] my colleague, like my work besties, even just like to say hi, a two minute conversation. Like I need that
[00:27:35.630] because I'm just, I'm talking to high schoolers all day.
[00:27:39.810] That makes total sense. I'm just imagining you like catching your work friend in the hallways and
[00:27:46.250] you're like, Oh my God, did you hear about like so-and-so? Like, did you hear about all the student
[00:27:50.270] drama right now? Oh no. Yeah. We update each other like no other. Like sometimes while I break in,
[00:27:57.770] as soon as the students leave, I like call up my friend. I'm like, Oh my God.
[00:28:02.550] That's so funny. They just told me this. And like, we keep it confidential to ourselves, you know?
[00:28:08.230] Right. Right. Like we know the students, but it's just so funny sometimes.
[00:28:11.030] It's like watching your own high school drama TV show. Yeah. Do you find that you ever have to like
[00:28:19.050] draw boundaries with your students? I say that because when I was a student, you know, with some
[00:28:24.490] of our younger teachers, the bad kids in the class would try to like follow them on Instagram or like
[00:28:30.770] add them on Facebook, try to kind of like push that limit with them even during class of sometimes they
[00:28:37.910] would like try to flirt or do these things. So have you ever had that experience with your students?
[00:28:43.410] I've had a couple experiences with students who try to like push those boundaries. And when that
[00:28:50.350] happens, I immediately draw the line. I don't entertain it. I like shut it down because it's just not
[00:28:57.050] appropriate. And so sometimes students will be like, Oh, can we like follow your Instagram? I'm like,
[00:29:02.290] no, not when like you're actively like my student. Right. I know some teachers who like,
[00:29:07.450] have students follow them like on their social media after they graduate. And like, I have a couple
[00:29:11.890] that I let follow me. And those are ones that I'm like, I trust you. You know, you're not gonna like,
[00:29:18.430] be telling like the current high schoolers anything. And in terms of like students who try to flirt,
[00:29:24.230] because I remember going to high school and like whenever there was a young, attractive sub,
[00:29:29.970] everyone will go crazy. I by no means am comparing myself to that.
[00:29:37.170] But you know, you always get like, a couple students who try to push that boundary. And I just
[00:29:43.870] don't, I will never entertain it. I'm like immediately know. And like, you know, if they're
[00:29:48.750] just trying to be funny too. But I think it's important not to humor them. Because it's also not
[00:29:56.090] every student truly knows you as a person. Yeah. And so even if you're trying to like meet at their
[00:30:00.650] level, and like just humor them, that is not going to be interpreted the same by everyone.
[00:30:06.330] And so I've had like, once he was like, Miss Lee, like, do you want to hang out this weekend? I was
[00:30:10.670] like, No, get out. Like, it's so right. Go home. And I think when I see that, I'm just like, they're
[00:30:18.430] just being teenagers, like being bold and like trying to be funny. And all these things. And
[00:30:25.930] you said your piece, I'm gonna say my
[00:30:29.510] they might try once. And when you shut it down, they don't bring it up again. And what they say
[00:30:34.570] amongst their friends, that's like, on their own personal time. But it's like what they say to me,
[00:30:38.990] and like how they interact with me. I'm just like, I very much draw that line. Because in my opinion,
[00:30:44.710] is it's not a humorous thing to entertain. Because it's like you are literally an adult who is
[00:30:50.150] responsible for them. And they are children. They are children. You'll see it on the news. Sometimes
[00:31:00.170] you'll see those teachers or coaches. It's like a teacher or coach who had an inappropriate
[00:31:05.510] relation with a student. I'm like, that's so insane. Because that's completely predatory.
[00:31:12.310] I'm just like, you're a grown adult preying on a young child. Yeah. People try to like work around
[00:31:18.190] especially if they're like 18. And I'm like, No, it's not because the context of what you're meeting
[00:31:23.630] them in is at a school site where you are responsible for them. And so when I see that,
[00:31:29.710] it's crazy. It is. And you're right, like they're children, like you're in completely different life
[00:31:36.070] stages. They're much more immature, not as an insult, just like as a fact, they're much more
[00:31:41.970] immature than you. And they're a completely different species almost. And I do think that
[00:31:48.890] in a way, like what I mentioned before about how it's important as a teacher to be secure in yourself,
[00:31:54.190] in your capacity to do well, to be an excellent teacher, to make a difference in all these things,
[00:32:01.110] you as an adult should not be seeking a child's validation. And I think that's where a lot of
[00:32:07.630] that kind of falls in line with too. So if like a student pushes boundaries or like wants to follow
[00:32:13.270] you on social media, or like they want to like hang out outside of school hours, or like they're
[00:32:16.930] flirting with you, you as a teacher should not be seeking their validation or their attention.
[00:32:22.410] I think this is especially interesting too, because I'm a huge TikTok person. And with social media
[00:32:29.070] being so big now, you can actually see real life evidence of this stuff on social media. So I know
[00:32:34.510] one of the things that was really popular a couple months ago were skits reenacting teachers who do
[00:32:41.550] crave and seek that validation, especially from a female teacher who seeks like male student athlete
[00:32:49.070] validation or something. So there were a lot of skits around that. And I remember watching it. And
[00:32:53.870] not to say that our school had a lot of like predatory teachers growing up, but there are like some elements
[00:32:59.790] of it where you see it and you're like, oh, there were teachers who like, kind of would joke back with
[00:33:05.490] like the male students a lot more than the female students. So I don't know, I just feel like with social
[00:33:10.850] media, being a teacher must feel a little bit different. Now, I do think so. And, you know,
[00:33:17.330] we went through a K through 12 education. I remember seeing teachers who give me that pick
[00:33:22.130] me behavior. Right? Everyone carries like their own insecurity, etc. And I think it's concerning when
[00:33:30.870] that falls into their careers. And especially when they're interacting, if their career consists of
[00:33:36.390] like interacting with children. I do think that with social media, that gets hard, because sometimes it
[00:33:44.110] feels like a double standard, right? Because as much as I am a high school teacher, I'm still
[00:33:49.010] just Hannah. And I love my job. I love what I do. But it's not all of who I am. There are like certain
[00:33:57.290] expectations and standards, like obviously, your students should not follow you on like your own
[00:34:01.450] personal social media. And so that's why a lot of teachers will try to do like a public social media
[00:34:06.550] doing social media. I'm like, that's actually so much work. But I do think with social media kind
[00:34:11.710] of blurs that line. Because social media enables like a parasocial relationship between you and
[00:34:18.230] like the people who view your content, or your followers. And when you're a teacher, you're
[00:34:25.050] supposed to stay in that realm as a teacher, when interacting with your students. I think that
[00:34:31.690] social media, it's still like an ever evolving field or like industry. And I think there are some
[00:34:38.790] blurred lines with that. Some people just have to use their discretion. But then I think that's where
[00:34:45.650] it can be kind of risky. Because again, no one knows you as a person just behind the screen.
[00:34:52.290] They can make their interpretations or these perceptions. And that can have like a lasting
[00:34:58.790] or like a very negative impact on your persona.
[00:35:03.030] Yeah, that's true. It's like a whole new section of professionalism that we are just like growing with.
[00:35:09.950] Because like when we were in high school, our teachers didn't have Instagram, like maybe they
[00:35:14.790] had Facebook. But honestly, even that was kind of rare. And so now it's like, okay, most people you
[00:35:20.950] bump into probably have one or the other Facebook or Instagram, you could probably find someone pretty
[00:35:27.570] easily, you know, searching LinkedIn or searching the internet. You know, like those TikToks where that
[00:35:33.970] one girl, she just like, find someone off of a name and a profile picture. And I'm like, dude,
[00:35:39.570] that's crazy. Like, that's the world we live in right now. It would be so easy for your students
[00:35:43.590] to just find you. And I guess at this point, it's like inevitable, right? All you can do is just
[00:35:48.150] private your Instagram and like, not necessarily prevent them from finding it, but prevent them from
[00:35:54.250] following it.
[00:35:55.170] And like the appeal social media is like, it's a very saturated industry, but you see the potential
[00:36:01.330] for it. And so there are very successful like teachers who also have like social media accounts.
[00:36:05.570] Like there's this one that I really like, and she just says, like, get ready with me in the morning.
[00:36:09.770] That's like strictly most of her content. And I'm like, I want to get my bag too.
[00:36:17.210] I want to get like, I don't know, like skincare. I think it can be rewarding. There might be high
[00:36:23.750] rewards, but there's also like high risk. And it kind of depends on like what you really prioritize.
[00:36:27.570] For me, like my Instagram is private, because I feel like I'm so much more open about my life on my
[00:36:33.910] Instagram. And that feels a lot more personal.
[00:36:37.130] Dude, do you watch Abbott Elementary?
[00:36:39.790] I do watch Abbott Elementary. Not like consistently, but sometimes I watch it.
[00:36:44.550] Yeah, same. I've been watching it slowly. And this kind of reminds me of that episode where like,
[00:36:50.230] they want funding for the school. And then they post like TikToks to go viral to get money from that
[00:36:56.830] so that they can buy supplies for their students. And then the kind of like, underlying message of
[00:37:02.970] that is like, oh, is it worth it to sell our souls to social media and like post fake content or not
[00:37:08.610] necessarily real or true content, just so that we can get, you know, the money to like provide for our
[00:37:15.310] kids. But yeah, I thought that was really interesting. As you said, there's potential there as a tool,
[00:37:20.490] but also it's a lot of work. And you have to really curate your content kind of.
[00:37:26.050] Well, that's the other thing too, right? I feel like even when we were in school, there was always
[00:37:30.350] discourse about how one, teachers are underfunded, but also to schools themselves are underfunded. So
[00:37:37.670] there's just not enough resources to be able to provide for students without dipping into your own
[00:37:43.430] personal money. And do you find that that's true and also a big problem in the current day? Or do you
[00:37:49.470] think things have gotten better over the years? It really kind of depends on the district that you're
[00:37:55.430] in. But I think even in my district that has a lot of, like we're a high performing district and
[00:38:03.990] generally more money is funded towards schools that are not as high performing, which is totally
[00:38:09.410] understandable. I know that in my first maybe three years of teaching, I've definitely spent a lot of
[00:38:14.510] my own money to kind of curate my classroom because that's like the room that my students are in and
[00:38:21.010] that I'm in all day. My side, definitely we can get our supplies, but we share it amongst the department.
[00:38:27.990] It kind of depends on where you're living, the performance of your district, location and like
[00:38:35.010] performance. I work at a high performing district in a more middle class, high class town. And so we
[00:38:44.050] definitely have like resources, but I definitely think that as like a first or a new teacher, you are
[00:38:49.950] definitely spending your own money to kind of curate your classroom, maybe your curriculum and all
[00:38:54.950] these things. I remember doing like a fundraiser, like Donors Choose, where every time someone donates,
[00:39:01.330] they match that donation. And so it's really easy to get funding for it or to reach your goal.
[00:39:07.290] And I remember sharing that on my social media and like people from high school
[00:39:11.070] like contributed and I was so moved by that because I was like, oh my gosh. And I felt very moved
[00:39:18.250] seeing people that I've known, even people I haven't talked to, like want to contribute.
[00:39:22.970] Also low-key felt like I was begging for money. Yeah, I was like, I feel so moved, but why do I
[00:39:32.130] feel so like, I feel so like jujuped? Like jujuped angry? Like I don't know how to say it. It's like,
[00:39:38.210] I just feel so like, I don't know, like conflicted about it. Like having to ask for money like that.
[00:39:43.970] Nevertheless, I appreciated it. I do think that as a country, we say we care about education,
[00:39:51.610] but I think the reality is that we do not because it's not prioritized. And instead we care about
[00:39:58.950] all the wrong things about education, like trying to ban books, trying to like control the curriculum
[00:40:05.190] and all these things at public schools, you know? Even though my school is like the oldest,
[00:40:11.430] probably one of the oldest schools in the district, we still have like those terrible desks
[00:40:15.070] where the table is connected to the seat. Still, there are some classrooms that have like the new
[00:40:22.370] desk where it's literally like a actual desk and like a separate like movable chair that's just more
[00:40:27.230] accessible and accommodating, but not everyone has those desks and chairs. And that's been like a
[00:40:33.910] continuous issue because it feels like an equity problem. Like it doesn't feel equitable that like some
[00:40:40.950] classrooms have those chairs. I'm just like, we bring results and we do well, like all these
[00:40:48.310] things were like up going above and beyond for students. Why can't we get enough funding for
[00:40:52.370] everyone to have these desks, which is like the most basic thing. And so there are times where
[00:40:57.330] it's frustrating because it just feels like we're like going three steps forward and two steps back.
[00:41:03.530] Sometimes we focus on other things that maybe as a teacher, we feel like it's not a priority
[00:41:09.370] because when we look at the field of education, it's so much more than teachers. There's so many
[00:41:14.090] other components to it and who gets to like make a decision on what gets prioritized and what doesn't.
[00:41:19.530] And so as a teacher, that can be frustrating because we're the ones who are actively interacting
[00:41:23.810] with our students on a daily basis. Oh my God, I do remember when you did the fundraiser in like the
[00:41:30.510] first couple of years. And as someone who donated, I feel like the vibe was not like, oh, I'm begging
[00:41:37.650] for money. It was more like, oh my God, I do remember being underfunded at school. So like Hannah needs
[00:41:43.250] this. Thank you. I know. I know like that wasn't like, but I think just like being the one to ask for
[00:41:51.650] it. I was like, wow, this feels so like humbling. Because I remember like when we were in high school,
[00:41:58.110] we would complain all the time about like our lockers and stuff, like just simple, basic necessities
[00:42:04.930] of school. And we were like, dude, our lockers are literally like rusting and like not okay. We were
[00:42:12.110] always complaining about how old our school was or just like how little funding we had. And then we
[00:42:17.650] looked at like the other schools in our district and we're like, how come they always get money?
[00:42:21.190] And we're stuck with these like half ripped textbooks, you know, like that kind of stuff.
[00:42:26.570] That's the memory that was triggered. And I was like, damn, Hannah's dealing with these problems
[00:42:31.450] yet again. We must help her.
[00:42:34.370] No, like in our high school. Oh my God. The deaths were terrible. They were so like close
[00:42:41.530] in proximity to each other. I was like, what if you have like physical needs? Like truly,
[00:42:48.950] you cannot be accommodated because the classrooms I was like, wow, they're actually really small.
[00:42:54.290] And it's just insane. I just remember our high school. I was like, Oh my God, I'm like at my
[00:42:58.710] high school again. Like it's like one of the oldest schools in the district. We perform really
[00:43:02.830] well, but then we look so like, we look like we have no funding. Yeah. And it was just insane.
[00:43:10.570] We had like trailers for classrooms.
[00:43:13.450] Yeah.
[00:43:14.890] The portables. Yeah, we have portables, not like a legitimate building.
[00:43:19.070] That was so insane. But a lot of that's out of the teacher's control. Like we live in a more like
[00:43:26.310] Western like individualistic society too. And so there's a lot of hearsay that like we care about
[00:43:32.050] education, but I don't really think that's not a priority. And so that's just like something that
[00:43:38.950] always rubs me the wrong way. I'm like, you could say you don't care about education. We can't get
[00:43:45.270] you to care. Yeah. But don't pretend like you care when you clearly don't, you know? And so.
[00:43:53.730] I feel like talking to you about your experience as a teacher has been so eye-opening because
[00:43:59.650] in a very simple sense, being a teacher is like guiding your students through your curriculum.
[00:44:05.190] But there's so many added layers that you talked us through today of navigating the social needs of
[00:44:11.730] a student and also navigating like the funding and resources aspect. And also knowing like the school
[00:44:17.430] and the various departments to make sure your students are feeling the most supported. Like
[00:44:21.250] all of these things feel like so much additional expectations that you kind of layer on top of
[00:44:27.910] just your like true duty of teaching your students a curriculum. So in many ways, I feel like being a
[00:44:33.110] teacher is very thankless or like receiving less thanks than it deserves because you're kind of
[00:44:40.790] raising the young generation for like a decent portion of their days. I don't know like if it's
[00:44:47.450] like a toxic mentality to just be like, oh, that just comes with the territory. And I do think that is a
[00:44:53.670] toxic. But I'm sure like, especially from an outside perspective, it must sound like a lot. And I think
[00:45:01.430] a lot of it does build up. If you're trying to support your students, and that's not even including like the
[00:45:07.950] instruction, right? And the curriculum building that we do. And a lot of adjustments that we make,
[00:45:13.710] because we want our students to succeed, but we also want them to strive for excellence.
[00:45:19.850] How do we hold them to high standards? How do we get them to meet those standards, be proficient,
[00:45:25.250] but also be like, okay, well, now that you've met those standards, like there's also you should try
[00:45:30.170] strive for excellence. I think when it comes to like being a teacher with like most careers, I feel like
[00:45:37.150] and just like our living costs, like our salaries have not increased like exponentially to meet like
[00:45:42.870] the demands of our economy right now. You know, people say salary is a scam. I 100% agree.
[00:45:51.190] Because there are so many more responsibilities outside of your actual like contracted hours.
[00:45:56.730] Yeah. And sometimes that's like chaperoning events, or being like a club advisor, doing what
[00:46:02.830] we call adjunct duty. And that can vary per school side or per district. But there are a lot of after
[00:46:09.630] school hours. Granted, of course, people are quick to point out that we have our vacations.
[00:46:14.650] And I don't think people understand that this job is not sustainable without those vacations. Because
[00:46:21.930] if you have gone through a public school, if you went through a traditional nine month school year,
[00:46:26.810] you know what it was like being a student, right? And you needed those vacations. There are some
[00:46:32.830] year round schools, where they kind of break up their vacation dates differently. And I think that also
[00:46:38.270] makes it more sustainable. But you will take work home. And I think the longer the more
[00:46:43.950] years you put into teaching, the faster you get at your grading. But sometimes life happens, right?
[00:46:49.630] Maybe you get married, maybe you have children, and like all these things. But you will always have work
[00:46:54.550] to do outside of your contracted hours. If we need to be out because I'm sick, or like we have like an
[00:47:02.590] emergency, we have to create lesson plans for our subs. Sometimes you have great subs. And like this is
[00:47:10.850] like, I appreciate all our subs. But sometimes there are certain lessons that are very teacher centered.
[00:47:18.030] And it's hard for a sub to do, you know, so sometimes it's just like, Oh, I needed to get
[00:47:22.690] this done. But like, I can't like 100% rely on the sub if you don't know them. That's just like,
[00:47:30.390] very interesting to me. Because I feel like, oh, if people are out sick, I don't feel like they have to
[00:47:34.030] delegate or sometimes like we have to have something in place. Yeah. Because just because we're out
[00:47:39.610] sick doesn't mean the students have a day off, essentially. There are a lot of other factors
[00:47:44.450] that go into teaching. If you don't have community, you will burn out 100%. And so it's super important
[00:47:51.590] as a teacher to have community. I think that's kind of what has helped me in my teaching career.
[00:47:58.870] I find the job very fulfilling. When you work with your students, and you see them every day,
[00:48:03.970] and you see those like light bulb moments where they get it, or they kind of reach a potential
[00:48:10.770] they didn't anticipate existing within themselves, it makes it feel like all the work pays off. And
[00:48:17.770] you've and I think what it is, is like, when you're a teacher, you're investing in a future that
[00:48:21.750] you will not see immediately. Or that's what investing is, right? Essentially, it's, you're putting
[00:48:28.090] out all this time and this work. And maybe you won't see those results in your time with them.
[00:48:34.650] Sometimes that's like, just the way it is, you know, but if I know that, like these students,
[00:48:38.970] if I know I'm helping them build these skills and these capacities, and like also redirecting them
[00:48:45.090] to like be good, decent humans, it just makes the job worthwhile, you know. But that cannot be the
[00:48:51.750] only thing that sustains you in this career. Yeah, people are like, Oh, do it for the children,
[00:48:56.090] do for the kids. I'm like, that's not a fair standard and expectation to hold teachers. Because
[00:49:02.270] at the end of the day, this is still a job. Like none of us are doing this for free. Some people I
[00:49:07.830] think will do exactly what they need to do, or what is kind of asked of them according to their
[00:49:11.910] contract. And then other people will do more. And that's really up to their discretion. Because
[00:49:15.870] at the end of the day, this is a job. And I also do think that like, if you want like x, y,
[00:49:20.710] y, you want this much more, these results, like you also have to incentivize or support your staff,
[00:49:27.330] because it's not realistic to expect everyone to be intrinsically motivated. Like our students are not
[00:49:34.690] intrinsically motivated, they're trying to get good grades, they're trying to go to college,
[00:49:38.290] they're trying to secure their future. There might be some students who are there for the pursuit of
[00:49:42.910] knowledge. And those students still exist, but it's not as high, you know, as it maybe was like
[00:49:50.370] years ago. And as teachers, like, yes, we're in it for the students, you're not in teaching if you're
[00:49:57.510] not invested in the students. But that cannot be the only thing that pushes you forward and keeps you
[00:50:04.450] going. Like we should have sustainable like salaries. And you need to have a good support system
[00:50:10.130] as a working adult. Yeah, for sure. And I think as an outsider, it's easy to forget how much of a
[00:50:17.810] handful a classroom of 20 kids can be. In a non teacher job, we interact with a lot of people as
[00:50:26.850] well. And you know, it can be tiring. But these are like adults, you're like literally handling like
[00:50:32.170] kids, right? It's a whole different thing. So I feel like it's really easy to forget how different that
[00:50:38.810] can be. You forget how much of a like, nuisance you yourself were as a teenager. I want to add to
[00:50:46.250] like in a public school, it's rare to have that low of a number of students. Oh, right. I think when
[00:50:52.670] I first when I was student teaching, I think there was like a period that had like 34 or 36 students.
[00:50:59.750] And there are schools that have like almost 39 students per period. Yeah, it's a lot. So I think
[00:51:07.250] the range is truly anywhere from like maybe 28 to like, at least your mid 30s. I think just like
[00:51:14.710] not at my side in particular, but just like across the board. It's a lot of students. And those students,
[00:51:20.770] they might have different needs, they might have IEPs, they might have 504s. And IEPs are like
[00:51:27.130] individualized education plans. And therefore students who might need like certain accommodations,
[00:51:31.470] because maybe they have ADHD, or they are emotionally disturbed, or they have certain like health needs.
[00:51:40.610] You have to also accommodate them. And you'll have a variety of them in your classes.
[00:51:45.890] Dude, and for us, it's very rare for us to even have a meeting with 30 people.
[00:51:50.690] Yeah, dude, I have this like very distinct memory of going up to do a presentation in one of my classes
[00:51:57.630] in high school. And it was a classroom where everyone faces the same way, like up to the front
[00:52:03.070] with like the where the teacher is. And when you're doing your presentation, you're getting the teacher
[00:52:08.130] view, right? I remember looking to do the presentation and seeing like 40 pairs of eyes and being like,
[00:52:13.730] holy shit, this is what our teacher sees every day. Yeah.
[00:52:20.330] Definitely mildly terrifying. But I think I feel so grateful for teachers like you, Hannah,
[00:52:25.610] and everyone else who kind of holds it down for the young generation. And I completely agree that
[00:52:32.170] we need to be paying our teachers more, we need to be funding our schools more, because this is a
[00:52:37.730] fairly complex and nuanced job. And also a very important one to kind of hold our society up in
[00:52:44.430] the future. So thank you so much for coming on and sharing your experiences with us of being a teacher.
