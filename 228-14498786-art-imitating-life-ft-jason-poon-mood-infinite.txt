[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Jason. I'm Jeff. Welcome Jason and Jeff, couple of new faces for the podcast. We were actually introduced to you two through a mutual friend who was also on the podcast before,
[00:00:26.460] Eugene. He was on the episode about hinge dating. I think that was sometime last year. It was a great episode. So listeners, if you haven't checked it out, definitely take a listen. So Jason and Jeff are two filmmakers in LA. We thought it'd be awesome to talk about
[00:00:41.980] their latest project and also just kind of that filmmaker life out in LA. Yeah, I've been doing film for quite a long time. I've been always interested in it since I was like a kid. Started when I was like 13. I was like really fascinated with anime.
[00:00:56.860] So I made this thing called like anime music videos. Oh my god. Oh, did you guys watch anime music videos? Is it like the Maple Story clips? I also made Maple Story clips. It's exactly like that. So I was really into like 90s hip hop. So
[00:01:10.540] I'd like take Tupac songs and put it next to Naruto, put it on YouTube. And that's kind of how I got started. And I was basically the video kid all the way throughout high school. When I
[00:01:19.340] turned 18, I was like, oh, I'm going to be famous on YouTube. So I started applying for like jobs on Craigslist of all places. And I found an ad. The ad said must be Asian, must have camera,
[00:01:30.380] must like Asian food. And it was for the Fun Brothers. That was like my first job out of high school. That's actually how I met Jason. Because Jason was a music video director at that time. He
[00:01:39.580] did like some of Fun Brothers big music videos, 626, Boba Life, am I correct? And I was like PA. There's one music video that Jason, I think that's the first music video that I met Jason on.
[00:01:49.820] He wasn't directing. I think you were gaffing. I had the twerk in a panda costume. That was like my first set experience. They're like, put on this panda costume and twerk. And
[00:01:58.780] I was like, I didn't even know what twerk meant at that time. So I just danced. And I was like, oh, this is film life here in LA, I guess. Welcome to YouTube. Especially that era of YouTube was like a lot of absurdity.
[00:02:11.820] That's so interesting. I feel like anime music videos and like Maple Story music videos were such a huge thing back in our childhood. I remember I used to watch some I like started
[00:02:22.060] to learn how to make some of them too. And I was like, this is way more complicated than it seems. So that's so funny that that was like the start of your interest into filmmaking. Did you ever upload any? Like, are they still available somewhere?
[00:02:36.060] No, I think I uploaded one to show some friends. And then after a while, I was like, I should wipe this from the internet. Wait, I'm so curious. What did you upload a video of you lip singing? Or was it like clips of a TV show or something?
[00:02:50.140] Oh, it was like a Maple Story one. So I literally made it look like the Maple Story character was singing. Like I made their mouth movements and all that and like move their arms around.
[00:03:04.060] I'm impressed. Honestly, I think back in high school, actually, a lot of like school projects were also music videos. We did like a music video for AP lit and then like a bunch of other
[00:03:14.220] science classes we would like lip sync to a video or something like that. So I feel like that was a music video crazy time. Man, this is a good segue back to Eugene. One of the reasons why I love Eugene is I
[00:03:25.260] remember he had a school video project in high school where he, the song was chemist with an attitude. It was the NWA song, but it was all like chemistry oriented. Oh my god. I'm like, that's such a lost period of our childhood when we were doing cringy parodies
[00:03:40.060] for school projects. Like I bet everybody has like a cringy school video project in their archive somewhere. For sure. Thinking back though, I'm also like, why did they even make us do video projects?
[00:03:50.620] We had no intro to like using any of the video software and like not all video software is free. So I don't know what they were expecting from us. That's true. They must have been like, your kids, you'll get it. You guys got computers, you know?
[00:04:05.100] It's really funny because I'm like 10 years older than Jeff. And so when I was in this version of what you guys are describing in high school, no one else was doing it. Not too many people
[00:04:15.580] have video cameras in general. And the process of having a camera and putting it onto your computer was a very complicated process. I did do that stuff in high school, but it was very rare at the time. And that's kind of what got me into like filmmaking.
[00:04:26.780] And so it's kind of funny that I think about now a lot of YouTubers even in high school, they're actually very skilled at creating video. They have so many technical skills, shooting. I'm seeing these tutorials, these really advanced tutorials, and I'm looking at them
[00:04:39.260] and I'm like, are you in high school or college? This is like really good content. And you seem very knowledgeable and technical. I feel like it gets even crazier too when you see people on TikTok do the transitions and stuff.
[00:04:51.260] Because they'll do it for like 40 seconds. They're filming the whole thing in 40 seconds, but you look at the actual outcome of it and it's like a crazy video with so many different filters and transitions. And I'm like, how are they planning this? It's like they already know how
[00:05:05.260] to use the software and it's baked into their brain. Otherwise, it would be impossible to make a video like that so quickly. I met someone that did a lot of that type of work. And it was funny because when
[00:05:14.460] she was describing video, she was saying, I don't even know how to use a real camera. That's like too complicated for me. But the phone is her tool and she's an expert at that tool or TikTok specifically. So that was kind of crazy hearing that.
[00:05:28.380] Yeah. I guess that makes so much sense because our phone cameras are so powerful now. Sometimes my parents will ask like, oh, didn't you have that old DSLR or something? Why don't you use that to take photos? And I'm like,
[00:05:41.740] our phones are basically more powerful than whatever DSLR I bought like 10, 15 years ago. So true. So then for you, Jason, since you had way less video exposure or just like random video projects
[00:05:57.180] from school, what was maybe like the spark that got you interested into video production or just like video editing? I remember I had a friend who was a handful of years older, but he was really techie.
[00:06:08.460] And I remember this is probably, I don't remember when this year it was, but this is over 20 years ago. And I remember just being a little kid and him showing me a video that he made.
[00:06:17.660] And this is on probably some very, very early version of Adobe Premiere. I don't even know how he figured out how to do it. And if someone saw this video today, they would think it's just
[00:06:25.660] completely like home video trash. But to me, him editing people, having video images of people I knew completely kind of removed the current of filmmaking. And it opened the idea that it's actually possible. I think before that moment, I never thought that making videos or anything like
[00:06:42.780] that was even possible. It was like some distant reality. And I think once that was implanted in my mind, I couldn't get out of it. And I had a friend who had a video camera and we would run
[00:06:50.540] around and shoot videos and he would edit on his VCR. For those of you who know what that is, he would edit the videos on his VCR. I didn't know how to do that. And then it wasn't until
[00:06:59.980] I got a little older, got a video camera, we started shooting stuff. And that was kind of the spark. It was around high school when I got into it. And from there, I couldn't let it go.
[00:07:09.740] It's too much fun. Dude, that's crazy. How do you even edit on VCR? I had the same thought. So I think he had two VCR. I don't know how it exactly works. But you have your video camera
[00:07:21.660] connected to the VCR. And then you push record on the VCR and then it basically records whatever's on the TV. And so then he would go to the camera and fast forward or rewind to a different part
[00:07:33.420] and then push play. And then he would push record. So it was a very manual process. And so based off how he recorded, if he messed up, he has to rewind on the VCR and then re-record
[00:07:43.180] that part. Dang. Oh my god. Yeah, I was thinking about it. I was like, okay, I know how to record over old film on VCR. But that sounds extremely complicated. Very tedious. But that's all we knew
[00:07:55.660] at the time. I mean, I didn't know. I didn't even know how to do it. But he was doing it. He would cut something that we had shot. You know, I don't know how long it would take him. But he'd just be
[00:08:02.060] doing it for hours. And it was pretty, it was pretty nuts. Wow. Would he like screen things for his friends at home? Like after you made the video, what happened to it? It was really just for
[00:08:10.700] us. I think there might have been a time when we would show it to people. But it was really just to show each other and we'd go to each other's houses and watch it. And that was it. Dang, that's
[00:08:19.180] so cool. At that point, it's like truly a dedication to the craft. We didn't know better. So that was actually kind of normal. It was almost the same way people might treat Minecraft or anything today. It's just something they would do like people who build these insane Minecraft
[00:08:33.420] buildings. That was I guess our version of you know, we're just kids spending time making stupid videos. But that's what it was. Man, I want to hear in Jason, you don't have to tell us but
[00:08:43.420] I'm like super curious about the time you went viral. And I don't even know the story yet. Which what? What are you referring to? Is this? I heard from Nate that you did some type of lip sync
[00:08:54.780] video that went viral before like YouTube was a thing. Oh, do tell. So pre YouTube, people would just pass videos on the internet, there would be websites or I don't even remember the websites,
[00:09:05.260] but there would be different websites you can download. Or there was another thing called IRC. And essentially, it's a database that you have to like put in codes and then download the videos
[00:09:14.620] manually. And you can kind of search for stuff there. Maybe like kind of the pre torrent era, so to speak, but I wouldn't say it was that viral. But I basically did a lip sync video
[00:09:24.780] that went viral. But I put a little twist to it where because I had some basic video editing skills, I would crop myself and then I did multi cam type of thing where it'd be like me doing one part,
[00:09:36.540] me doing one part and then me doing another part. And it was a very like shitty version of this edit thing. But at the time, people were just doing it on like a webcam. Whereas I was
[00:09:44.780] actually trying to put some video editing technique into it. My friend always jokes, he said, you were doing TikTok 20 years before TikTok. If you kept going with it, you could be a billionaire
[00:09:54.220] I mean, yeah, I feel like that was super ahead of its time. Like that kind of reminds me of back in the day when YouTube covers were huge. Like people pretty much did that kind of edit for
[00:10:05.420] their covers. Someone's playing the guitar and then they cut right you know, someone playing the piano and then all the people harmonizing and all that kind of stuff. So this is a very inventive
[00:10:15.180] I'm impressed. I'm like, I think I'm like, man, I thought that before YouTube was even invented. That's kind of crazy. Yeah. You kind of like predicted the future. Actually, that's kind of
[00:10:23.580] that is wild. I feel like stuff only if only your video to be honest should be in a museum. Like I would see it. I would want to go to a museum where it has videos that are like dated like this.
[00:10:34.700] I did a lip sync to Jessica Simpsons. I want to love you forever. And I think the the just the position of an Asian guy singing that at the time I think was really absurd and
[00:10:43.900] weird and unexpected. I think that was part of the the viral draw. Maybe song choice is amazing. That's so sick. It's like that reminds me of like, do you all remember the viral like,
[00:10:55.420] I think it was also a lip sync video. He's like Asian guys doing Backstreet Boys and they were like dancing to it. And that one went really viral. I think towards the beginning of YouTube. I remember you're like in like one small college dorm room or something, right?
[00:11:10.780] Exactly. Yeah, there was a group called the bok choy boys that did something like that they would do either covers or they would do think parodies of those songs. And it was like a bunch of Asian
[00:11:20.940] guys. Yeah, I feel like there are so many gyms. Yeah, during the early internet because everyone's like, Oh, well, I guess I can just like put up just random shit that comes to my mind. I mean,
[00:11:32.220] I think the origin of Ryan Higa is just that he put videos on YouTube because he was trying to show his family and then he was like, Oh, wait, actually the whole world can see this like,
[00:11:41.420] oh my bad. But now I feel like there's way more rules in filmmaking almost TikTok even YouTube, YouTube shorts. It's always like, what kind of content are you creating? So YouTube is almost more reserved for like, super high quality, independent filmmakers who are making
[00:12:00.540] super high quality stuff that are almost like documentary or movie level. And then TikTok is like really fast paced and a little more casual, but like gimmicky almost in some ways, like the transitions that we talked about. So I feel like nowadays in terms of that, like insane
[00:12:16.940] weirdness and like creativity, it's kind of gone down in a sense, but it's still very interesting to see how quality overall has like improved. Super impressive. I just feel some of the content
[00:12:29.660] I see from really young people, I would, I could never at their ages is insane quality. And I'm so impressed by some of the stuff that I see. Yeah. Hey, don't discount yourself. You're a
[00:12:40.380] visionary. True. I think video must be like a second language to kids, you know, like iPad kids just grew up watching video. They probably watch videos before they can read or write. It's true.
[00:12:52.940] It makes me wonder though, because I guess back when content and like creation wasn't as easy to do. I feel like a lot of the times we were kind of walking around observing life, right? And then
[00:13:04.780] whatever you wanted to put into the camera was things that you maybe observed about life and thought was interesting enough to kind of rewatch later. But it's interesting because if TikTok is so easy for kids to pick up, especially, and that's something that they're constantly on,
[00:13:20.300] then our creators that are kind of younger and born into that TikTok era, like do they kind of have that TikTok mindset when it comes to creating stuff? So like, are they maybe more thinking like,
[00:13:32.220] oh, I saw that this went viral. So I'm thinking in ways that will make something go viral versus maybe back then we were kind of thinking like, the world is so beautiful and not to over idealize the
[00:13:43.020] past, but truly it was kind of more like we were immersed in the world rather than like real life being half of our real lives. Like now the digital world is so real as well.
[00:13:53.020] This kind of goes into my own film journey. Like I mentioned to you guys on the pre-call that I'm focusing on fashion now and other stuff. And after pursuing video professionally for 10, 12
[00:14:02.780] years, I got pretty burnt out and it wasn't even a conscious burnout. It was very subconscious. And I was relatively happy in my journey, but it wasn't until the pandemic where things kind of stopped and I had time to reflect. And I realized that it wasn't something that
[00:14:16.540] I still loved it and I was still happy about doing it, but there was something about it that I felt really tired from. And I think it was maybe the next step of what you're describing,
[00:14:27.180] where people are thinking about audience and content and reception and virality as one of the main drivers for how they create. And I think for myself, my version of that was a sustainable working video career and job. And so all the art I created, the video I created
[00:14:42.940] was with how to make money at top of mind. And I lost the joy of why I was creating. And I was having a hard time to blend. I think the people who are very successful can kind of blend both
[00:14:54.540] really well, where they're able to please a client and make money and generate something that somebody wants, but also enjoy that process where I was really just trying to do what I thought
[00:15:04.540] other people wanted to do. And I felt really tired. I think even a way that with filmmaking, I think it's already difficult enough to become a person that makes movies in theaters. I only
[00:15:14.140] know one person that I know who wasn't that, and that actually became that out of hundreds of filmmakers that I've met, specifically as a director, maybe in other positions I've seen that happen, but someone that's like a nobody that becomes a director that's making movies
[00:15:27.180] that's in theaters is really, really rare. And so just that is already difficult enough, but to have that whole journey and process where I feel that I'm just giving and giving without actually doing anything that I enjoy, I think really drained me and it wasn't sustainable in
[00:15:40.460] the long run. And so I feel like as I'm coming back to it, and even with this project, I do feel that sense of meaning, joy, doing something that I like. I actually feel like I'm growing and this journey
[00:15:53.260] is teaching me a lot about myself, but also stretching the boundaries of how I create. That's really fun. So interesting, dude. I feel like what you also talk about and Jisoo's question, how I'm thinking about it in my head is
[00:16:07.580] there's the larger question of how we reckon with turning our passion into a commodity, into something that is a part of the capitalistic system and has to be exchangeable for value, which is very wildly different than why we got into our passions in the first place. And that
[00:16:23.900] kind of disorientation or conflict in thought is difficult for everybody to reckon with. And I feel like it's interesting thinking about, back to Jisoo's questions about kids and TikTok,
[00:16:35.260] I think most kids say they want to be a YouTuber as their job now when they grow up, which is so interesting, right? But I think that goes to show you that it's also a career that people recognize
[00:16:45.420] in the same way that, I don't know, there's college majors for eSports. That's such a good point. Back in our day, especially for us as children of immigrants or Asian Americans, the idea of doing something
[00:16:58.220] that's not STEM is just so crazy. It's like, what do you mean you want to make videos for YouTube? What does that even mean, right? And now it's just such a regular thing. It's actually so crazy
[00:17:09.660] because I've seen my parents refer to YouTube as a money-making avenue now as well. And I'm like, a money-making avenue now as well? And I'm like, where was this 10 years ago? Now it's like, oh,
[00:17:26.460] these people are putting stuff on YouTube and making money. And I was like, okay, first of all, it's not that easy, but also... Are they telling you in the context of giving you advice?
[00:17:37.340] I think they said one of their friends who likes to hike takes videos of their hikes and just puts it on YouTube or something. And they're like, yeah, if they get X amount of views,
[00:17:49.260] they'll get a little bit of money. So who knows if they get way more views? That's a lot of money, right? And I'm like, okay, yes. But also, it's not that easy. We've actually been watching YouTube
[00:18:01.340] growing up, but it feels like at least my parents are just discovering the potential of YouTube and just capitalist potential of virality. It's really funny because I remember around the time that Jeff and maybe even a little bit earlier,
[00:18:17.580] that early, if you were watching a lot of Asian American YouTube during that late 2000s and early 2010s, YouTube kind of felt like a little bit of a ghetto where people who couldn't make it into
[00:18:27.260] quote unquote Hollywood, they all put their films and stuff in YouTube and it kind of blew up. And it was a self-sustaining kind of environment and ecosystem. And people, the musicians, Asian
[00:18:38.300] singers, songwriters were able to have a career where they could tour around the world just off of the fame that they got on the internet for it to kind of go in a place where now this ghetto is
[00:18:48.540] now the goal. It's kind of crazy when I think about it that way. It's kind of got gentrified, right? I mean, that's kind of what it is. And now it's like people see value in it and they want to
[00:18:59.260] buy a property here. It's true. Yeah, that's so crazy. YouTube is gentrified. That is a good way of putting it, though. Because now people come on YouTube, their first video is so well produced already or they're already hiring editors to help with thumbnail creation, video edits, all that
[00:19:19.740] kind of stuff. But just 10, 15 years ago, the first video on every channel is probably the grainiest, most jank video that they could come up with. And then you slowly see the progress of improvement. I will say that maybe the good part about seeing the platform grow, and maybe,
[00:19:42.300] Jason, you can attest to this too, is that the genres have diversified. The type of content before on YouTube was like there's also still a type of genre, right? Like acoustic pop covers
[00:19:52.700] of Billboard Top 100 songs and so on and so forth. Or like Talking Heads where they just rant about a controversial opinion to camera. Me and Jason talk about cinematic vlogs being this really cool in-between of YouTube content and filmmaking. And I think if there's no YouTube,
[00:20:08.940] there wouldn't be this genre. And I feel like we both love that genre and like watching it. Do you guys remember when YouTube used to recap the whole year and have a basically get the top
[00:20:18.140] YouTubers to do something? Yeah. One of the conversations I heard about that was now that it's expanded too much, and there's so many niches that have millions, potentially billions of views that they can't even fit all of them into one video because it doesn't even make sense because
[00:20:32.060] it's so wide at this point. Whereas before, it was kind of limited to America or North America and you have these top YouTubers that you can just pick and these 30 people are in the video. Now
[00:20:44.780] it's hundreds and hundreds of people and there's no way to actually create a recap because your version of YouTube may not even exist. And they may have billions of views but
[00:20:53.500] you watch the video, you're like, I have no idea who 95% of these creators are. This makes no sense to me. Whereas before you kind of get to see this like a multiverse of YouTubers, and you kind of enjoy
[00:21:02.780] that super collaboration. Where now it's just so wide that doesn't even make sense. Yeah, that's a really good point because I remember towards the end of those recaps, people kept complaining like
[00:21:12.220] how could you have not included this YouTuber or that one or whatever? And then I feel like at the time it was such a like, oh my god, how could they not have put this person in? Now looking back,
[00:21:23.820] it's like, okay yeah, it makes sense that this is what caused the downfall of those recaps and just the crazy expansion at like what felt like exponential timeline. Well it's still crazy that
[00:21:35.020] YouTube's still here though. Like I feel like so many video platforms have come and gone and it's still kind of like where people end up. Well we also mentioned how thanks to YouTube and other
[00:21:45.980] such platforms, there are just basically genres that might not even exist in the world today without these platforms. So some that you mentioned earlier, cinematic vlogging. Honestly like vlogging itself is kind of a platform-specific genre as well. And I feel like something else that will also
[00:22:03.660] forever live on YouTube is music videos. So many different genres of music videos too. The anime music videos that Jeff made back in the day, the legitimate Hollywood production music videos that
[00:22:17.260] we get. And then also kind of tying into what we mentioned earlier, like how those Asian American artists were creating music and music videos on YouTube. So I guess to tie all that together,
[00:22:32.300] it relates to the project that you two have been working on lately which is also a music video. So for this music video project, what is the biggest theme would you say? I think the main
[00:22:44.780] theme of this project is to explore the gray area of past relationships. It's easy to think about it in black or white, especially when there's painful breakups which I've experienced as well.
[00:22:55.100] I think at the end of the day, our more nuanced, me and Jason's perspective on relationships, the more nuanced perspective is that there really is no right or wrong. Sometimes it just doesn't work
[00:23:05.500] even if it was a good relationship. There might have still been love. There probably was love and it was real and it was tangible. But sometimes it just doesn't work and exploring
[00:23:15.820] and having an audience for a couple that they like, but it doesn't necessarily work out in the end. But that's okay, I think is what we're trying to say with this film. I think one thing that we
[00:23:25.820] touch on them in the music video is memories and how depending on our lens, we can judge the memories as a positive or negative thing. It becomes just a texture of the whole experience. We wanted to explore that idea throughout the project.
[00:23:39.660] Yeah, and I think one thought I have is the theme of your music video sounds very relatable and I feel like that's something that maybe is sometimes hard for really big production companies that are Hollywood machines to showcase or create. I feel like it's a big
[00:23:58.380] discourse lately that all these rich people, rich and famous people are super out of touch with just like us regular people. I think it's nice to see that smaller or independent filmmakers still explore these deeper themes and can show something that most people can relate to.
[00:24:19.740] One thing that I think was special about this project was that the artist that funded the project, and it's essentially a passion project and he used his life savings to put this towards a video. He wanted to do something that represented the album, but the album was
[00:24:33.980] a process of like seven years in the making and there were so many things that he wanted in it. He gave us a lot of creative freedom to kind of explore whatever we want to explore,
[00:24:43.180] translate the things that we received from his album into some sort of video. That relationship I think is fairly rare where most people have a lot of opinions or they want it a specific way, but he really gave us freedom to kind of explore
[00:24:57.500] and I think that's a pretty rare thing that definitely wouldn't happen, I think, with a traditional studio, especially if they've never put out any music. There's no way they would give a creative license to create whatever with the budget and all that. It almost feels like this
[00:25:11.740] is something that would only exist on the internet with people who really have a belief and passion for whatever they're creating. For sure. This is truly independent. We basically worked without
[00:25:21.740] a deadline. I mean, it was like whenever we felt good about it. We would spend sessions at our office and me and Jason would be like, I'm like, what's up with your love life, man? Tell me what's
[00:25:32.780] going on. Tell me your history. We were already close, but I think through the project and working on this topic matter, we got even closer just sitting outside the little patio chairs. A lot of group therapy. Even for the artist too, Junsei, just getting to know about his...
[00:25:49.340] I mean, the original name of the album was Love Story. So it was just like a matter of exploring each other's past history and trying to come away with new thoughts and feelings about it. And
[00:26:00.060] that definitely, our own experience is definitely a big inspiration for the eventual music video. Dang, I wish I could have sat in on some of those tea sessions. I feel like there was a lot of
[00:26:09.180] gossip shared probably. Lots of tea porn. So then I guess if a lot of this project was kind of left up to both of your interpretations of the music, how much of your real experiences do you
[00:26:22.700] think are in the music video? I guess like the direct question would be if some of your exes were to sit down and watch this music video, do you think they would be like, oh shit, this was
[00:26:32.300] from 2012. Like this was back when we were dating. Or do you think you kind of try to extrapolate the bigger themes out of your love life? When we started the video project, this was in summer of
[00:26:42.140] 2021. Is that right? Yes, two years ago. Summer of 2021. So it's been two and a half years since the project was, we had our first meeting as a group. The artist actually reached out to me
[00:26:51.820] about the project probably three years ago. And so it's been a long process. And when I started the project, I was single. And then during the project, I was in a relationship. And then I
[00:27:01.740] went through a breakup. And now that was like a year later. And now we're finally releasing the project. In creating the project, I don't think there was anything that necessarily drew from the relationship that was in. That was already kind of happening while we were already, where the
[00:27:13.660] project was already shot. But if you were to watch the project, I think it's a natural question to ask. And I thought that's just a funny coincidence or we talk about how sometimes art imitates life
[00:27:24.620] and then life imitates art. Where someone who watched that and knew me might say, oh, this must be from your personal experience. But I'm like, no, I actually shot this before I was even
[00:27:31.980] in that relationship. And so it's kind of this funny thing where I'm sure there was subconscious influences from just general relationships. But also, even as I'm making it, there's maybe subtle choices that I make. But when we were writing it, it was when I was single. And so
[00:27:45.900] the fact that I went through this whole relationship arc during the music video making process, it's kind of funny. That is pretty funny. Like, was there a moment halfway where you were
[00:27:55.020] like, Oh, I think we have to change this one part. Like now that I'm wise, you know, some of this needs to change. As I mature as an artist. I feel like that's the stuff you got to keep in.
[00:28:06.060] The uncomfortable, embarrassing stuff. And I wouldn't even say there's anything directly that correlates to my life specifically. But when I feel that embarrassment or oh, this is too raw, I feel like that's the stuff that has to go in. That's bars.
[00:28:22.940] I think that's what makes it feel three dimensional. That's that stuff where I think there's a lot of directors that when I watched their movies, I see parts of their life in there. And the fact that I'm questioning whether it was real or not, I love that.
[00:28:37.020] I guess you can never put something out that's like, not never, but like, if you put stuff out that's less polished, or like sugar coated, then it's more possible that people will be like, Oh, yeah, like that happened to me too. I'm cringing right along with you.
[00:28:55.340] It's a little bit Taylor Swift-esque. A couple weeks ago, Crystal and I and a bunch of our friends had like a karaoke night at our place. And our two friends are like huge Swifties. So
[00:29:03.740] then they sat us down and we watched the entire All Too Well 10 minute version music video together on the couch. The whole time I was like, Oh my god, I'm just witnessing like exactly what happened
[00:29:13.020] in Taylor Swift's relationship. Oh my god, yeah. At some point, I think they paused and they're like explaining parts of it to us. Video breakdown. The Taylor Swift lore. And also they were like singing along to the whole thing and like the full 10 minute version
[00:29:27.740] music video has that part in the middle where it's just like no music and the two actors are arguing. We're like, wait, should we switch to the like non music video version? They're like nah, watch the argument. I think they even like said the argument lines with the
[00:29:46.140] argument lines with the- Oh yeah, they don't like acted it out. They already knew it. They memorized it. It was so funny. But yeah, it was like a really good story
[00:29:55.180] told. And you know, at first we were skeptical about it. But then as it was going on, we were like engrossed. We were like, oh yeah, like what's gonna happen next? Oh my god, like-
[00:30:05.740] Dang, I feel like we should watch it. You probably should. It's kind of juicy. Jeff, do you feel like the how much of Love Story or No Clouds But Summer do you feel like you drew
[00:30:14.700] from certain things? I remember one of the writing process that we did was write a backstory for our characters. And that backstory was I just basically wrote my own like experience, like a compilation
[00:30:28.620] almost of like past relationships. And even like some from my current relationship. Was the party scene that was something you wrote, right? Oh, the party scene was actually from my own
[00:30:36.460] love life. Yes. So I guess the other detail of this is the editor and my partner in Popeye Media, the production company is Kelsey, who's also my girlfriend. That party scene was inspired by the first time that we met. I didn't know y'all spelled Kelsey.
[00:30:56.860] And she was in the scene as an extra too. Oh, she was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a cameo. Wow, that's cool. I feel like is it is it kind of weird to be like publishing a little bit of
[00:31:06.780] backstory about yourself? I guess not because I feel like it feels very obscured. I don't think people would know that necessarily. You know, there are certain details that were changed to make it less specific. I don't think people would know. I think the experiences are just
[00:31:22.780] inspiration points. And then from there, we build the whole world. So it could be something that happened that was real, but then we contextualize it to the character's experience. And then what would make sense within this world. And so if it matches with maybe our own personal experience,
[00:31:35.820] or you know, the writer's experience, then we can kind of go with that. But if it doesn't make sense, we just kind of bring it back to the character and build off that. I guess even with
[00:31:43.900] a little bit of obstruction, I can only imagine you would have to feel so vulnerable, right? Like putting out these things that may have been painful, or like Jason said, embarrassing, maybe even memories from pre real adult, like you're probably like 1415. And some of these
[00:31:59.260] relationships, like how do you kind of grapple with these thoughts of Oh, God, these are like potentially painful memories of my past, but also this would be like really good,
[00:32:09.900] juicy shit for the music video. This is kind of like a tangential answer. But I feel like as artists, you have to find this medium ground of like exposing yourself to like pass the wounds,
[00:32:21.980] and like making yourself super cringe without like, going too far where you're like sent into a hole of depression. You just have to like open up the like seal a little bit like it's like you're
[00:32:31.580] like, Oh, I remember, let me start writing this down, you know, without like opening it too wide. There's something definitely cathartic about the experience. And maybe this is kind of twisted, but I remember in early relationships, and this was when I was in film school,
[00:32:45.980] I would be having an argument. I had it with my with my ex in during the argument. I'm like, oh, this is really good for a script. And it's like this. Because the the passion and energy
[00:32:56.700] felt so visceral. And and I felt that this could be such great stuff for a script or story. And not like partially being thinking about that, but also being in this argument at the same time.
[00:33:06.860] So I'm frustrated at the argument, but also excited that the art that I could create from this. And I feel there's a little bit of a lot of artists, I definitely, I'm not saying that Taylor
[00:33:16.140] Swift sabotages her own life to create art. But sometimes it feels like that, you know, it's like, oh, another boyfriend, another story, what's next, you know, and the next album is gonna have some
[00:33:24.860] Super Bowl content, who knows, you know? You know, like the life imitates art and art imitates life thing like also happened to me where I was like, Kelsey and I would have a fight. And I'm
[00:33:34.220] like, am I hearing lines from the actual like music video? I started like disassociating. Like I went third, like third person, I looked at myself like what's happening? Like, you're like mentally recording this.
[00:33:48.060] That kind of back and forth. It gets weird, actually, just because we were working on it so long. And I was also editing it. So I was just like watching it again and again. I was
[00:33:54.700] like brainwashing myself. Wow. Then do you feel like your art imitates life a little more often? Or your life imitates your art? My gut feeling is that consciously, art imitates life. But subconsciously the other way around where the things I've created now become a part of the
[00:34:18.380] things I think about. And even the things I consume become some of the things that I think about. So not even just in my own personal art, but art in general. Yeah. But I feel like that's
[00:34:27.500] a very subconscious process versus the other way around where I'm creating from my experiences or things I'm thinking about. Retweet. I like what you said though, Jason, about how sometimes it's not even your own art that you're like getting sucked into. I feel like sometimes when I'm
[00:34:43.020] binging a show, I become the main character. I'm like, okay, I'm just going to pick up this main character's traits and become them for the next week because I'm so obsessed with this show
[00:34:52.940] or whatever. Yeah. Dude, when I had my succession obsession, I think almost exactly a year ago, I literally became Kendall Roy himself and I threw myself into work. And I started so many
[00:35:07.340] projects. I was gunning for this promotion. And then I picked up a new obsession. I think I started watching Gossip Girl or something. And immediately I was like, I'm no longer motivated onto the next phase of my life. That's so crazy.
[00:35:23.100] It is interesting how media and the stuff we consume can modulate our emotions. We can almost tune our emotions based off what we consume, whether that's hip hop or a certain show. Yeah, for sure. And I feel like this is... We've been talking about videos and stuff,
[00:35:37.180] but I feel like this could also totally happen for reading scripts or reading books, especially because books give you so much specific detail and word. And then you just imagine it all in your head. I feel like it's really putting the subconscious at work versus
[00:35:53.820] films and stuff. They'll kind of set the scene for you. You have to do a little less mental labor. You just imagine yourself there. So I think that's also kind of an interesting thing.
[00:36:02.460] But then for you two as filmmakers, you have to turn the words that you first created into the whole world. So how is that process like? This is probably my favorite part of the process. I think one of the most exciting
[00:36:17.980] things about filmmaking is creating dialogue or writing lines and then hearing someone else say it or hearing someone say it on camera or seeing it in the edit. That to me is really the magic
[00:36:30.940] of filmmaking for me, where I have argument or I have... Not necessarily argument. I have a conversation or I have an emotion I'm trying to evoke and I figure out, okay, what's the best way
[00:36:39.660] to say this or tell this? And from there, seeing it being read by the actors, then we record it and then seeing it in the edit room. That's the magic or the specialness that I think is one of
[00:36:50.780] my favorite parts of the process. What you said, Jason, made me think of one of my favorite scenes from the music video is we shot at ABC Cafe, which is kind of this iconic vintage Hong Kong
[00:37:03.420] diner in Monterey Park. Originally, we had an idea of some type of late night restaurant, but from writing it and then seeing the location to talking to the owner, to them letting us shoot,
[00:37:14.620] to putting the actors inside the scene and then lighting it and then watching it from camera, it's like what Jason said. It almost feels like this direct output from your brain into something you're seeing with your eyes. It's really trippy and very gratifying.
[00:37:29.420] Yeah, I think there's almost... For me, it's almost like the addiction of filmmaking, if you will, where knowing that that's possible and kind of chasing that feeling constantly. And that's the thing that I think drives a lot of filmmakers, at least for myself. I feel that's
[00:37:41.900] always something that I'm always excited about is the days we get to go film, the days we get to go be on set. Those are the funnest for me. Yeah. Do you sometimes find though that when
[00:37:51.820] actors kind of bring whatever you wrote to life, it turns out completely different than what you imagine? Because I'm sure you're sort of visualizing something when you put pen to paper. But I feel
[00:38:01.820] like just like how you guys interpreted the music for your music video, actors, when they see a script, they also interpreted it themselves to their own experiences. So is it sometimes completely different from your intentions? Yeah, for sure. I think also in terms of relationships
[00:38:17.660] and love, everyone comes from a different context and different experience. So it's our job to kind of align with the actors, but also hear their opinions and input on what they feel when they're
[00:38:28.620] embodying the script and the words and the context and the emotions that they're feeling in the moment. That process, I would say, is also very gratifying because then you can kind of see the script or the scene in different angles, the delivery accented in different ways, the kind
[00:38:43.980] of back and forth being changed in the rhythm of it. That part of it is very interesting. And then also that's just the rehearsal or even the acting part of it, and then going into editing and being
[00:38:52.860] able to fine tune that further. With our project, we wrote some lines for all the scenes, but certain scenes we kind of gave the actors a lot of freedom to operate. And that's where what you mentioned,
[00:39:05.500] I think happens a lot, where they bring in whatever they're feeling in that moment. And that could be from who knows what, whether it was their own personal experiences or the way they interpreted
[00:39:15.180] the character. And lines and words would just come out. We as directors need to kind of dial this to make sure that it'll fit in the whole context. But within that moment in the world, sometimes we don't
[00:39:23.820] know what they're going to say. And there was some stuff where we would feel that in the moment, they're just yelling at each other and like, oh my God, this is insane. And just living through
[00:39:33.100] it with them in that moment. And then the craziest thing is we have to do another take. So it's that discharge. And then we reset, and then they got to do it again. And shout out to the actors who have
[00:39:44.060] to kind of emotionally donate and give their energy to the world, to the camera. There was a blowout fight scene in the music video. And I feel like that was probably some
[00:39:53.740] of the best acting for both actors. And even to the point where it's like, we didn't necessarily script the crying scene, but it just kind of came naturally. Surprises like that are so cool. You're
[00:40:04.700] like, oh my God, I can't believe it's happening right now. I feel like kind of to tie into that, though, there's a certain level of maybe like artistic freedom that you have to get used to,
[00:40:16.380] or maybe freedom isn't the right word. But essentially, like you have a picture in your mind, but it kind of morphs and changes as the process goes on. Because there's so many artists working on one project, you know, the actors, the directors, all of that stuff,
[00:40:30.620] you kind of have to let go of some things is what I'm imagining. I guess my question for that is, like, do you find it comes easily, for the most part? Or is it sometimes really hard to like,
[00:40:43.100] let go of this, I guess, almost like perfectionism kind of feeling? Me personally, I feel like having made films for so long now, I've given that up entirely. Like I fully acknowledge that filmmaking is like a team sport. Just to use a basketball analogy,
[00:41:00.300] there's like no hero ball here. Like there really can't be made without other people. I just accept that the changes that happen are part of the fun and part of the dynamic nature of making something together. I approach filmmaking with open hands. It's something we all share.
[00:41:14.700] Yeah, I think the idea of perfection, in terms of getting exactly what you want, or exactly what you need, or exactly what you envision, and how they translate perfectly efficiently from the whole processing is not realistic. Or I don't think anyone's experience
[00:41:29.100] of filmmaking is like that. There's always going to be things that maybe affect the schedule or availability, or just different factors. All that plays into how things kind of happen. I think there's also the flip side where you have these quote, unquote, happy accidents.
[00:41:43.740] And that adds to the film, something you didn't necessarily plan for, but it becomes the perfect thing that you didn't know you needed until you saw it and you have it. And so both contribute
[00:41:53.100] to the process and the final output. And I think that's part of the fun. There's a little bit of this randomness and faith almost. Yeah, filmmaking is almost like a faith journey a little bit too.
[00:42:02.940] Yes. There's both options too, where it might be not as good as what you imagined, but there's also times where it's way better than you could have even imagined. Yeah. I guess it's kind of truly art imitating life because life also doesn't always go as
[00:42:17.340] planned and you can't be too perfectionist about how everything ties together in life. Especially relationships, the whole theme of the music video is about, I feel like it's really
[00:42:29.740] hard to be like, all right, this is how things are going to go between you and me. And these are the things we need to be doing and getting everything down to a T. You kind of just have to
[00:42:40.220] ride the waves. That's a good connection. Yeah. I have a tangential story that it made me think of something I like doing when I travel is if I encounter an uncle, I will ask him what his
[00:42:53.340] thoughts on love are. And this is kind of like a... I'll try to condense the story. But one time I was in Korea with my friend John and we were hiking up this ridiculously long mountain. And the context
[00:43:03.980] is like last night we were clubbing. So we're super hungover and he's like, let's go for a light hike. This will kind of clear everything up. It was not a light hike. I don't think he really read
[00:43:13.340] the signs. He was like, oh, we're almost there. Literally four hours into the hike, we finally reached the peak. And it's one of those like they had metal poles on the side of the mountain
[00:43:22.540] because there's really no path. You're kind of like scaling. You're like 45 degrees on the mountain, scaling it and grappling this metal rod to go up to the top. We went there with one water bottle.
[00:43:35.980] Just like completely unprepared, like maybe on the brink of death. But we're on the peak of the mountain. I'm looking at the like, I can't believe we're here. I'm starving. We didn't eat.
[00:43:45.660] Like I think I had like a bagel. And then I see an uncle in the distance. He's like he has a like a fruit knife and he's like skinning a pear. And I think I stared too long to the point where
[00:43:56.540] he walked over and handed us the pear. Oh my god, it was the best pear I've ever had in my life. We both ate it and we thanked them previously. And he was like, do you guys have a way to get down?
[00:44:09.180] I was like, is it more difficult to get down? He's like, yes. And it's getting dark. Long story short, he walks us down and we were having this like kind of heart to heart. And I'm asking like what he
[00:44:18.540] thinks about love. He was just telling me that like love is sacrifice. Just kind of like what you're talking about, Crystal, was like love is sacrifice and that you just have to roll with the
[00:44:28.380] punches and it's never going to be perfect. But that's what's perfect about it is what he was telling me. You know, a little delirious, but I was like, oh, let's hit it. You're right. You know?
[00:44:37.500] Yeah, we have a line in the music video where we kind of reference that idea. I think there's something about using the football analogy since the Superbowl yesterday, like Monday quarterbacking
[00:44:47.580] and thinking about what it was. It's easy to kind of frame it in these terms of sacrifice and all these things. But in the moment, it's so hard to are you sacrificing or are you compromising your
[00:44:59.020] own integrity? Or are you whatever, you know, the negative version of over sacrifice and giving too much in a way where you're taking away from maybe who you are as a person and that can be unhealthy
[00:45:10.460] as well or overcompensating or whatever it may be. And so I think there's these nuances within the video that we're kind of exploring, but it's fun to kind of observe it as a filmmaker and kind of
[00:45:23.020] talk about it. For the music video, is the artist younger than you two? Yeah. So do you feel like in the process of like working with him to make the video, he learned a lot about love from you two?
[00:45:41.420] Interesting. I wish he was here to answer that question. We definitely lectured him. We're giving him like the older brother energy, right? Let me tell you what you got to do, man. What do you think? Jeff, what do you think? I don't know. You know, okay.
[00:46:00.620] Something about Junsei I think is his greatest trait is that he's very reassured. I mean, obviously take someone with like a high level of confidence that like put their life saving towards like a passion project and being like, it'll work out. He was like very chill about
[00:46:14.220] everything. So I feel like I'm not sure if he learned anything because I feel like he himself has a very self reassured ideal, almost like conceptual feeling on what love is to him.
[00:46:26.380] And I feel like maybe ours don't necessarily line up with him. And I respect that. I kind of respect his idealism towards love. And I feel like that was always his input on the project in general,
[00:46:40.060] and like what his experience was and what he wants to convey with his music is the ideal, his ideals on love. Yeah, that's really good. I guess that's a good way to put it because I feel
[00:46:50.380] like love is something that's easier to teach than it is to learn because I'm sure everyone has had that experience of you're like watching your close friend walk into something that you know is going
[00:47:01.900] to be a disaster in like six months. And no matter what you say, no matter which way you say it or how you try to show them, nothing's going to change because sometimes people just have to
[00:47:10.620] experience things and I feel like love specifically, it's like, you just have to go through it. And then you'll take away what you want to take away or what is fitting for you to take away
[00:47:19.980] in that moment. But it's like, there's just no way to actually communicate these things or pass these lessons on without that experience. And it also kind of makes me think about how love is such
[00:47:32.140] a subjective thing. But I feel like the way everyone talks about it can sometimes make it seem like it's subjective, especially when people are like, oh, this person was so mature during the
[00:47:42.140] breakup, or I was so mature or whatever. It's like, what does that even mean? Like, what is maturity in a breakup? I don't I feel like that line doesn't exist, but everyone somehow kind of
[00:47:50.540] refers to it. And I always feel like it's a very like externally imposed line. It's like someone else is always telling you you're the mature one. But where is that objective line kind of?
[00:48:01.660] So I think with this being like a major theme for your music video, Crystal and I were kind of like outlining some of these things beforehand too. And I was just like, all of this is so subjective. So it's hard to actually have like objective ideas about it.
[00:48:15.100] I think that's the fun part of filmmaking is that we can present our ideas. But at the end of the day, the audience makes their own decisions on what it is, whether they agree with the main
[00:48:24.620] character did or not or disagree. But that's the conversation. It's not really about a specific, we may have an agenda, we may have a perspective, but once the audience has a hold of it, it's out of our control. It's out of our hands.
[00:48:36.060] I think maybe our perspective on that we're trying to show in this music video that you just helped us articulate is perhaps that like, we're trying to show that there is no objectivity. That
[00:48:46.540] is the kind of gray areas that just be like subjective. And maybe the best way to approach love is to be like, there is no objectivity, just live with the subjective. I get the feeling that it's really easy to obsess over like what's right and what's wrong.
[00:49:00.620] But like you said, there's so much gray area. And we oftentimes get caught up in maybe like the heat of the moment if it was, you know, say an argument or something. You're like, I want to be right,
[00:49:13.900] basically. Or I want this person to like, agree with what I'm trying to say and like understand what I'm trying to say that easily kind of snowballs into each side getting more defensive
[00:49:25.500] or more angry. And I think this kind of plays a role in larger filmmaking as well. Sometimes I feel like the best films or videos or whatever are the ones at the end where you really sit with it
[00:49:38.460] and you're like, whoa, like there's so many perspectives to consider. That's why Jason has to watch past lives. Have you guys seen it? I have. I have not. Oh, I think that's one of those films that does that where you're like,
[00:49:53.100] who are you rooting for? You know, at the end? Yeah, it's definitely one of those like you sit down and you kind of think about at the end. You're like, hmm, what would I do? Or like, which one would I want to be?
[00:50:05.500] Yeah, go watch it. Go watch it. Yeah. So speaking of, you know, going to watch past lives, we should definitely go see your music video. Yeah. So can you let us know when your music video officially releases and where we can find it?
[00:50:25.420] Yeah, we have two really exciting announcements. One, the music video will be released on Valentine's Day, February 14th on one of my favorite YouTube channels, Wong Fu Productions, which is a huge achievement for both me and Jason. We're super excited. We even did like an interview with them
[00:50:41.820] and got to go to their office. I was geeking out. The second announcement is that it's going to be showing at the Disorient Asian American Film Festival in Eugene, Oregon on March 9th. And that's our first film festival premiere,
[00:50:56.140] the Pacific North Forest premiere. Exciting stuff. Hopefully we'll have more submissions. But on YouTube, February 14th in theaters, March 9th. Well, awesome. I'm very excited to see it. And by the time this episode is released,
[00:51:09.100] your video should already be up on the Wong Fu channel. So for our listeners out there, definitely check that out. And how can our listeners find you two specifically? You guys can follow me on Instagram at Jason.Huming.Poon. I'm also a fashion designer,
