[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crest Podcast. I'm Jisoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jen.
[00:00:16.480] Before we get started on our topic today, we have a fun Gen Z word to talk about.
[00:00:23.760] I think this is like low-key a made-up word because I saw one TikTok about it where someone was like, oh, an industry insider tip to looking good in photos, and they described the mewing technique. And then after that, everyone was obsessed with mewing. So then now I think it became this whole meme, where if someone is looking really snatched on the red carpet and their jawline looks really good,
[00:01:43.000] all the comments will be like, oh, bro's mewing. She's m or something. But yeah, and then all these TikToks started popping up. That's like, this is how you knew. I think I tried it once I was looking in the mirror and I was like, I don't know if I'm doing this right. I don't know if this is working. Dude. So I also tried it, right. And I was looking at my side profile in the mirror and for some reason,
[00:03:00.300] every time I knew, I think it pushes out everything that's
[00:03:03.759] supposed to be getting sucked in.
[00:03:05.639] So it has the opposite effect for me.
[00:04:05.840] minimal which is good and then I have like kind of the middle right okay and then Jisoo has like a tie that's closer to the tip of her tongue so someone needs
[00:04:09.819] to invent a fucking technique for mewing that tongue-tied people can also do
[00:04:14.919] shout out to all my tongue-tied people out there but dude I love this mewing
[00:04:19.819] meme because I feel like it's just evolved from a photography modeling then we're like, wow, we understand football. And then after the Super Bowl, I proceeded to watch like, four hours of TikTok about football. I could totally be a sports girl. Wait, I can't believe that person didn't answer your questions. Wait, yeah. Dude, yeah. Because by the time it was like end of the game overtime, or OT.
[00:05:45.279] As the fans call it OT.
[00:06:41.240] No, I'm with you though. A lot of the times they could have just run the ball.
[00:06:44.279] I obviously know the strategy after watching one game.
[00:06:50.480] No, I literally had the same exact comment.
[00:06:52.480] I was like, why don't they just run it down?
[00:06:54.519] Like, why do they keep ramming themselves into the defense?
[00:06:58.639] Yeah.
[00:06:58.839] And like, why can't they just catch the ball?
[00:07:00.600] Like, could it really be that hard?
[00:07:03.120] Okay, wait though, like how sad are your friends about the Niners losing? have a friend who's like a huge 49ers fan and during the Super Bowl towards the end we're like oh I'm kind of scared to like say stuff in the group chat. The group chat got so quiet after they lost. Dude, that's so sad. But you're right I was also thinking about that. It's like damn these people get really invested in sports and it's a lot of
[00:08:23.639] a lot of feelings maybe that's where they channel all their feelings. flexibility, working remotely and working from home and that kind of flexibility in our lives. So I guess to start us off, how flexible is your current day job in terms of like work locations, working from home, working from anywhere? Yeah so I work fully remote and my company has a policy where you can work
[00:09:42.960] 30 days away from home. So I've used this policy when I was in Europe. And I think I worked like 10 to six, which isn't too bad. Then four weeks working pretty regular hours, hanging out with friends after work and then on the weekends, then two weeks vacation. So it wasn't too much of a transition, I would say.
[00:11:00.220] It was just like a different location,
[00:11:01.919] but it was still a familiar location
[00:11:04.159] because I had lived there for two years beforehand. I always feel like sometimes it is nice to go in the office, but like having the flexibility, of course, is like the ultimate goal. Yeah. So my office is in New York, so I don't usually go into the office unless they like fly me out. At the end of my Europe trip in 2022, I was actually planning, quotes,
[00:12:22.779] planning to move to New York afterwards.
[00:13:26.120] working from home. So I think it would be actually kind of interesting to work in office more regularly, but maybe for the future.
[00:13:30.100] You know, I've been kind of reminiscing on like pre-COVID work life lately. And there
[00:13:35.399] was something special about being in office five days a week before COVID that I feel
[00:13:41.480] like will just never come back ever again.'s only so many days that you go in and have the possibility of seeing other people. I always feel bad when I like go into the office maybe to like pick something up and then like go home and I see someone and they're like oh hey what's up and I'm like hey my backpack is on and I'm like getting ready
[00:15:00.200] to leave you know and this is like the first time I've seen them all week I'm
[00:15:03.279] like haha hey.
[00:15:04.840] Yeah it's interesting I feel you make your desk really comfortable and like, sit down in it, you recognize everything, it feels very familiar.
[00:16:21.100] It is easier, I've noticed, to like, get into the rhythm of things quicker, get into the
[00:16:25.759] zone, I guess.
[00:16:26.759] Yeah, that makes sense. like New York apartments are small so I was just like working in my bedroom and every time I would kind of like turn around look at my bed and be like wow working in a room with a bed is so like distracting. I'm just thinking about like crawling into bed and like putting pulling up some shows or something and like definitely not being productive. You're right I think having that
[00:17:42.720] separation is definitely helpful. I feel like something that I've it up, I'm like, okay, my head is clear and I can live my life again. Agreed. When there's so much glitter, you're like, oh fuck, this is a sign. Life is getting too hectic right now. But I do wonder, have you all worked while traveling before? I guess, Jen, you said you did work remotely abroad for a couple weeks before taking a
[00:19:03.759] couple weeks vacation. Sometimes I feel like because I'm traveling, my priority in that moment feels like travel and not work. So then if I have like meetings and stuff on like a day where I'm working from like a different location, I feel like it's getting in the way of my life, even though it's fully like within work hours. So that's the one thing I feel like my attitude does change a little bit.
[00:20:20.200] Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:20:21.960] Because you're kind of like, oh, I'm in a new spot like new place, I should definitely
[00:20:25.240] be enjoying it or you know,'m on this call as well. So after that, I was just like, okay, I'm never doing that ever again. Oh my god, that sounds horrible.
[00:21:40.039] That reminds me of this hour, I've gotten like three or four pings from this director about, hey can we talk about this? Oh, I can actually meet at 6 p.m my time or like whatever and basically I get off the plane, I've missed this impromptu meeting and I have like DM'd this person that I haven't worked with
[00:23:03.920] before being like, oh sorry I missed this, can we actually do right now? Anyways know we're in the meeting blah blah and then someone's like oh Crystal they said something about like being in the office so I guess they assumed I was in the office because people were walking behind me so they're like oh if you're in the office can you like ask this person about what like whatever and I was like oh I'm not in the office but I
[00:24:24.220] didn't know if I should say I was at the airport or not I was supposed to work for like a week in Taiwan, work my hours or whatever. Luckily I got to work UK hours so like I got to stop at 12 but I remember the next day I woke up and I was just like I cannot do anything right now. I am just so my body is shutting down. Yeah yeah that was horrible. Oh my god. Did you take a sick day? Yeah like I tried to month and then people kept booking him for East Coast meetings so he would just have calendar blocks every day that said like unavailable please do not book unavailable in all caps in brackets and then please do not book is like regular yeah so then usually if I have to do
[00:27:00.519] something I'll just be like unavailable please do not book So I'm like setting up hotspot on my phone to like, you know, call in on the on the call. And then at one point, my skip is just like, you know, you keep cutting out. So why don't we just end this meeting and then you can update me offline? Because it seems like everything's fine. I was like, Oh my god, thank God, like, why didn't I just cancel this meeting?
[00:28:22.960] I had a similar experience. I guess it's not people's screens, all of their shit was loading and I'm like, why? Why do they hate me? And then like, we hit turbulence and literally nothing is working. I'm just gonna shut my laptop anyways. Like this is a travel day. Like I don't have to get anything done. Whatever.
[00:30:42.000] I'm like, what's the T in this company?
[00:30:45.500] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:30:50.299] But I am kind of curious since we've mentioned working in these different locations and working while traveling.
[00:30:53.000] I think another big thing that could be an important point is equipment.
[00:30:58.400] So anything like a wireless keyboard, a wireless mouse, a webcam sometimes,
[00:31:04.000] or even monitors and things like that.
[00:32:06.640] I think for the most part, I also only bring my laptop, but the exception is when I go to visit my parents in Dallas, they have like a little desk setup.
[00:32:10.559] So then I'll always bring my webcam, because I can place that on top of the monitor that
[00:32:14.519] I use.
[00:32:15.640] And I'll bring my keyboard and mouse.
[00:32:17.880] Wait, what if crazy idea, but what if your parents kept a set of keyboard and mice for
[00:32:24.359] you at the place?
[00:32:26.079] Are you nuts?
[00:32:28.799] That's true. during COVID and then it was like, oh, if you need anything, just go into the office and grab it. And like when I was in the office, I was like, should I take my monitor? Did I take this standing desk? The standing desk is crazy. No, it was like an attachment. So it's not like the whole desk. It's just something that went on top. I was like, Damn, you're strong as hell. I was like, she really
[00:33:43.599] pulled up in a U-Haul.
[00:33:47.079] Honestly, though, the funny thing to me about like this like time right so what I end up doing is I drive all the way to therapy and I sit in my car and I dial in from my car and then like the moment the meeting ends I'm like slamming my laptop down like running into therapy like one minute late or something normally I never have like a virtual background but because I'm like literally in my car I'm like okay I need to like you know
[00:35:02.320] put put some kind of virtual background here so I always like a couple months leading up to wherever they were going. And then wouldn't be seen as weird that they started using this virtual background. That's clever. They were planning in advance. Yeah, he's probably wondering like, Oh, where are they?
[00:36:22.679] Probably one of those.
[00:36:25.639] The extra caution.
[00:36:27.199] That's true. If you're the type to judge that you know how to corner of my room. And then it's like outside of therapy. So like the best lighting ever like super clear. So it's a pretty funny contrast. They're like, Oh, she opened her window. Glass skin who? Once I had a 7.30am analytics all hands meeting, and I had to like talk
[00:37:42.400] during it because we have these like quiz breaks or whatever. And first of all, I need to like pretend it's West Coast time right now. Like need it to look super bright. But I also noticed, I think my manager has like caught on to some of my, I don't know, I guess like not the best calling in on meeting habits because sometimes if I'm running late, I'll just like call into a meeting while I'm
[00:39:00.900] driving and then I go camera off and like mute usually, but normally, you
[00:39:06.320] know, I always have my camera on.
[00:40:00.880] More engagement. So I was kind of like still parked, but like getting ready to drive,
[00:40:04.000] making small talk and I was driving James's car, you know, like the Tesla sounds,
[00:40:09.039] like, you know how it makes noises?
[00:40:11.199] It's like, ding, you know, like the Tesla sound.
[00:40:12.960] Oh, yeah.
[00:40:13.920] Like when the green light comes up.
[00:40:15.599] Yeah.
[00:40:16.159] So it kept making that sound and I was like, holy fuck.
[00:40:19.119] And I was like, oh, I'm gonna like go on mute for a little bit, but I hope
[00:40:22.320] other people dial in soon and I just muted myself.
[00:41:22.860] something that we're lucky to have, but also at the end of the day,
[00:41:25.599] like we have our own lives and stuff.
[00:41:27.320] So I also feel like it could be more of a right
[00:41:29.460] than a privilege.
[00:41:30.519] What do you guys think?
[00:41:31.920] I think that's interesting.
[00:41:33.219] I mean, I definitely think it's a privilege
[00:41:36.280] that we can do it with so much flexibility.
[00:41:39.639] I also think though that like remote work was a thing
[00:41:43.320] even before COVID, at least at my old company,
[00:41:47.000] there were definitely people that worked remotely, managers and their direct reports and stuff. In that sense, I can say like, maybe it feels more like a, I don't know if it's necessarily a right, but it almost feels like we earned the right through trust, right? But I guess I can't really say much about, you know, the overall like corporate opinion on it. Honestly, like, I think I work way better at home than I would in an office, even though
[00:43:04.679] I don't really know. work best in different environments? I think honestly too, what I really appreciate is being able to work while traveling. I mean, what is just fun and nice to kind of switch up the environment from time to time? Sometimes it's just logistically more convenient that way. But I think also knowing that your team and your manager
[00:44:20.360] trust you to the point where they're fine with you
[00:44:22.320] working from some remote location for a little bit, Sometimes it's just nice to like sit with friends and you know, everyone just focuses on their work, get shit done. And then they're like, okay, cool. We can go out and like party after. It's like a nice reward. I think I agree with what you both said. Um, it's just really nice to like feel that trust and you're right. It does kind of encourage you to work harder.
[00:45:40.039] Like, oh yeah, these people trust me.
[00:45:41.719] So let me show them that they can continue to trust me.
[00:45:45.199] But I do think a lot of this like work stuff, most of the experience, the office girly experience. But then, then after I've done that for a year, I can go back to being a remote employee. Yeah, that makes total sense. Yeah, I feel like when a company adds that benefit, I know it's just kind of like an HR thing, but it does make me feel like they actually give a shit about their employees.
[00:47:01.280] For a really long time, I feel like it was expected that people were living to work,
