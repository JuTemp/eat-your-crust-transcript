[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jessica. So today we're back with a Girl Talk episode and you might hear a familiar voice, Jessica. She has been on episode 117, Startup Culture in the Workplace. And fun fact, she was also
[00:00:30.380] our roommate in college. So the three of us, me, Jessica and Crystal, we used to live together back in the college days. But before we jump into our topic, Crystal, let's hear your Gen Z word of the week. So this week's Gen Z word is actually an acronym, which is kind of exciting because I think we talked about it a few times that Gen Z doesn't seem to use acronyms too much. So the word is POV,
[00:00:54.740] which stands for point of view. It's used kind of interestingly. I guess the best way I can think to describe it is that it is used to describe like videos. Oh, like POV, this is what's happening in the video. Like you're on your way to walk your dog or something. And the video is like someone is about to walk their dog. Yeah, I think I first saw it on TikTok when acting out skits sort of solo,
[00:01:20.460] almost monologue style skits of people acting out scenarios were really hype. So it would be like POV, you have a really strict teacher, and they're sending you to detention. And then like the TikToker would pretend to be a student getting in trouble, act out the scenario and stuff like that. And I was like, this is a crazy like that was when TikTok was peak creativity and less so like, look at this funny thing that happened to me sort of. So kind of like a culture shock for me. I was like, wow, they have all these scenarios in their head, and they're just acting it out.
[00:01:50.000] Yeah, I think those are the ones that I've seen too. Or sometimes I think recently, I've seen the ones where it's just someone filming themselves or like filming something completely random. And then it's just giant text over the video that's like POV, blah, blah, blah, and like a scenario that has nothing to do with the actual video. So we should go back to the creative
[00:02:11.420] days. It kind of reminds me of when millennials were big on Tumblr. Instead of like the POV meme format, it would be like when your boyfriend does blah, blah, blah, or like when something, something, something. And it's just like describing a scenario pretty much. Yeah, that's true. I actually thought of this word today because I'm currently visiting Dallas and I went to a museum is all about the JFK
[00:02:39.560] assassination. In the museum, they kind of talk about a few conspiracies. And there's one that's like, there's like another spot where someone had fired a gun for the assassination. So we walked over to the spot of the conspiracy theory and it's by this fence. When we walked over to it, there's like some graffiti on the fence and someone wrote POV, you're the real JFK assassin. I was like, whoa.
[00:03:05.880] Dude, that's a really good use of it. Yeah, they're so funny. This generation is hilarious. I feel like millennials didn't get the funny bone as much as Ben Z did. Yeah, I think it's always pretty funny because it's like, it's kind of witty to use like POV describing the scenario. Sometimes it's like what wasn't explicitly shown in the video. And it's like the behind the scenes kind of of the video or the
[00:03:31.020] like implied thing. How easy is this term to use in real life? Do you guys think? It's probably not too hard to use it, but to use it well might be a little harder. Yeah, like you have to put a lot of thought into it for sure. I feel like it needs to be funny if you're going to use it because POV is very much like a setup for like a hilarious joke. And if the follow through isn't good, then it's just like, okay, you just use a Gen Z word, but
[00:03:59.040] you know, your jokes aren't matching up to the name basically. I agree with what you said, Jisoo, about how POV is similar to the millennial when something, something, something. And that actually reminded me of a previous Gen Z word of the week, eras. Or like, I'm in my blah era. And then you guys kind of related it back to the millennial phase, right? The mom is not just a phase, but kind of used in a slightly different way.
[00:04:28.640] It's interesting to see all these Gen Z words kind of adopting a different actual word, but there are roots elsewhere in millennial language and probably before that too. Yeah, that's true. Like in the end, a lot of the same things are just being said in a different way. Yeah. It's so funny too, that you say that because for a while, and we have also talked about this on this podcast, I think, but for a while, Gen Z TikTokers were like flaming millennials for being
[00:04:58.200] really cringe. And there were a lot of like, in hindsight, cringe things that were really popular with us when we were probably like 13, 14, even up to high school and whatnot. But I noticed that the new trend on TikTok is Gen Z people doing like self critique sort of. So they were like, oh, it's kind of cringe when like Gen Z people say Delulu or whatever, like the new phrase is. Oh my gosh. They're like, we're just basically like millennials. And I'm like, oh my god, they're maturing and like evolving, you know?
[00:05:28.340] Oh my god. Oh my god. They're in their self-aware era. I can't wait for the next generation to come up. Yet somehow they still managed to shit on us. I know. They're like, oh my god, we're so cringe. We're just like millennials. It's like, fuck. They're cheeky now. Well, I guess Gen Z word aside, let's kind of jump into the topic this week.
[00:05:52.820] Today, our Girl Talk topic is healthy relationships. I think in a lot of our past Girl Talks, we've talked about kind of like the beginning stage of relationships and how we approach those things. But you know, oftentimes, once you get through that beginning stage, there's a whole mid to long term stage of a relationship that you encounter. And I think there's a lot of interesting things and learnings that go on during that period as well.
[00:06:19.700] Let's start off with talking about some challenges. Crystal and Jessica, what have been some of the biggest challenges for you or your relationships kind of early on? I think I kind of have an answer here. I feel like in the beginning of relationships, it's really easy to like get very caught up in it. You end up spending a ton of time on it. So it's easy to like forget
[00:06:45.780] about all your other responsibilities, I guess. And then that relationship becomes the center of your focus, I guess. So I think that's like maybe a very common one. Because I feel like it was also a common thing back in the day to be like, oh, this person's entering a new relationship. They never hang out with us now because they're just so focused on it. It's like super easy to get caught up in it. Yeah, that makes me think too. I wonder if part of the difficulty of that is like, almost like the integration because it's like when you're first starting out a relationship,
[00:07:15.180] you're like constructing something from nothing to something. But then once you have that thing built out, you need to integrate it into your daily life because your whole life isn't just going to be this person. It's like you also have friends and like your job and your hobbies and things like that. But to go from construction to like integrating, I think that transition can definitely be a challenge. I think for me, it was interesting because I had never been in a relationship prior to my
[00:07:41.500] current relationship, which wonderfully worked out really great. But I remember at the very beginning, when we first started dating first, second, third month ish, I was very adamant to not be that person who was like, oh, like, she just got into a new relationship disappears off the face of the earth to all our friends. So I was very determined to like, be chill, and still be
[00:08:09.560] exactly who I was, not spend all of my time with him, which was obviously very difficult. And I think because I had never been in a relationship before that, and like seeing all my friends who would sort of like disappear or, you know, bring their boyfriend along to everything. And I knew how that made me feel, which wasn't bad in any way. But it was just like, okay, it was something that because I had seen everyone else do that, I was more conscious of it in the beginning. That was a little bit of a
[00:08:39.400] transition in the beginning, and not necessarily like a huge challenge per se, but just something that I became more conscious of as time went on. I feel like that's pretty good. Because it's like, you truly learned from other people's experiences. Because I feel like nowadays, in our current age, that kind of pattern doesn't happen as often. But like, you know, way back in, say, high school or something, it was like a very common thing to see happen to friends.
[00:09:06.120] Yeah. Unfortunately, I'm like low-key that bitch that just falls into a relationship really hard. But for me, my biggest challenge was probably kind of like the transition phases that I was talking about. So everyone always talks about like the honeymoon phase, and I think it's very real. But as the term indicates that phase doesn't last the whole time, especially if it's like a really intense honeymoon
[00:09:32.980] phase where you're like really honeymooning, you know, you can't live like that forever. Or maybe some couples can, but I feel like in my experience, there's some sort of fade off there. I have this theory where a lot of couples kind of break up around the two-year mark or so. And I think sometimes it's because that's when the honeymoon phase really drops off. And you have a choice of like, this person is going to be in my lifestyle, okay meeting my family and friends all the time,
[00:10:00.060] and I'm okay meeting his family and friends, etc, etc. Or you're like, well, maybe I just enjoyed the honeymoon or like the newness of this relationship. For me, I feel like it was going from, oh my god, this is absolute bliss. Like I am obsessed with this person. Being with this person brings me the utmost joy to like, okay, now I actually have to like live my life and like be like a normal person. You know, maintaining the love and the excitement even after that new phase is over was probably
[00:10:28.960] a challenge for me. Because then that's when you like really start to talk about shit, I feel. That's when you learn how to combat challenges or like conflict together. So not just like fun and rainbow sort of. Yeah, I think transition overall is pretty difficult all the time. Yeah, I think something that was interesting for me, and it might be now that I'm thinking about it
[00:10:51.620] might be specific to that time period. When we first got together, our first year was like our last year of college. So that kind of lines up with the honeymoon phase. And it was also, I think, compounded by the fact that it was like senior year of college. And it's like, you know, everyone's having a lot of fun. And it naturally is just a very fun time of your life. And then it kind of timed itself well with honeymoon phase ending. And then we're also graduating and entering into the workforce.
[00:11:22.020] And life gets a little bit more dreary, not as carefree as when you're in school. Right. And so something for me, I feel like during that time period of transition was not only having my relationship be transitioning in its phases, but also the rest of my life also kind of transitioning where I'm transitioning from being a student all my life to now working full time and kind of dealing
[00:11:49.240] with that and bringing different aspects of what was changing in my life to my relationship, and then also vice versa. Right. I'm not sure how many people can relate to that very specific transition period. But that time period was a lot of learning what we needed to expect from each other. Obviously, you know, people always say like, you know, the most important thing is communication,
[00:12:13.820] which is, of course it is. But also really understanding how to fight your fights. I think that makes a lot of sense. And just like if anyone in a relationship were to go through any sort of change, new job, or as you said, like from student to working, it's like extra stress just in general, right? Like as a person, you're like, fuck, I have this relationship. And now I have this like extra stress to think about. So can totally understand that.
[00:12:43.600] I think that brings up a really good point too, of like, how do you deal with conflict in a romantic relationship? Because things always come up. Sometimes it is internal stuff like in your relationship that are active issues that you need to combat. And other times it's conflict that arises from an external source that you still need to fight as like a couple. So how do you kind of go about with bringing things up when it's a problem and also resolving it together? Well, I guess the classic
[00:13:11.240] saying or whatever is that you try to tackle a problem as a team, that you're solving it together instead of trying to win. But that's always easier said than done. I think something that has helped me is, I'm not really sure where I learned this from. It was definitely pre TikTok era. It's basically instead of phrasing your arguments or like what you want to
[00:13:38.440] say in a way that's very blamey, like you're blaming the other person or when you say like, oh, like you did this and you did this and then you did this. And it just feels like you're putting a lot of blame on the other person. But instead, it's kind of phrasing what you want to say in terms of, yes, they did this. But more importantly, how did that make you feel? So actually, maybe I learned
[00:14:01.880] this at work. But it's like, you know, when you didn't remember my birthday, it made me feel very undervalued or it made me feel like you didn't really care about me or something like that. And I think that way of framing it helps to still put the situation and the issue at hand, like in the spotlight. But that's also highlighting, like more importantly, the result of what happened in that
[00:14:31.380] situation, right? And it's like, yes, you're still highlighting what they did wrong or what you felt like they did wrong. But you're also kind of showing them that like, I get that you did this, but it's bad or I feel like it's bad and it's shitty because it made me feel some type of way. That's not a good way to feel in a relationship. So I feel like it makes for a more conducive conversation rather than like straight up argument where you might be pointing fingers at each other a lot.
[00:14:59.840] I think I actually heard about that as well. Also not from TikTok. But I always liked that advice as well. I'm pretty sure I actually learned it from work. Like at my first job when I was trying to learn to manage people. And I'm pretty sure my boss told me to use that like strategy. And I was like, oh, you're like, I'm gonna use that on one of my direct reports, my boyfriend.
[00:15:25.320] But yeah, I do like that. I think it definitely helps relieve some of the targeted language, I guess. It feels more like, oh, this, as you said, like a result. And then you're like, okay, well, what can we do to fix that? Also, I can relate to this because I feel like fights and conflict often are triggered by like a certain emotion, whether it's like you're really upset or sad or like you're angry. And I think
[00:15:49.180] personally, anger and sadness are probably my two like quickest trigger emotions sort of. When I first started dating James and also just like dating in general, I feel like there were a lot of things that would like annoy me or I would be mad at and then I would go into these fights feeling that emotion already. And this is gonna sound really stupid. And I don't think this is universal advice. So please take this with a grain of salt. But because any sort of fight that I would start where I was mad,
[00:16:16.960] it would always end poorly, because it's like, I'm in there with like a certain aggressive mood or emotion or something. So then I realized that like fights that happen when I'm sad go better, you know, because it's like, they're not necessarily on the defensive. They're just like, oh my god, there's like a sad person, and I'm gonna feel a certain way. They're probably apologetic. And then I'm feeling also apologetic. So I'm like, oh my god, don't be sad, because I'm sad. So then I feel
[00:16:42.300] like it ended better. So I try to kind of guide my emotions in that way. I'm like, okay, I'm sad because what this person did made me feel sad instead of like, oh, I'm pissed that you did this, because why would you do this? Because I'm sad. You know what I mean? So I know it sounds really stupid. But that's just like something that kind of works for me. It's almost like you're calming down your anger. Yeah, definitely. Do you feel like part of a sadness is also like disappointment?
[00:17:07.880] Yeah, I think sometimes it is that too. And I will say, I think one of the benefits of like a really long term relationship is you get to know each other so well. There are times where I'm about to do something and I'm like, this is gonna piss James off. And then I'm like, I shouldn't do that. Like, naughty, naughty, you know? And then I'm sure he has the same things too. Or sometimes he'll be like, oh, I almost did this. But I knew that would annoy you. So like, I would never do that.
[00:17:33.660] And it's like, you learn to navigate away from fights, kind of like sailing a boat or some shit. But in the beginning, like every fight or wrongdoing feels like an utter betrayal and a sign that your relationship isn't going to work out and stuff for dramatic people like me. So I think that's also why it has gotten easier a little bit. I guess like before it was a minefield. And now you have the map. Exactly. That's very true. I think to your point, over time, you start to really get
[00:18:03.560] to know what are certain triggers for the other person. You can almost predict how the other person is going to react. Especially I think when they get in a certain mood, you like know what's going to happen when they're in that mood. You know what I mean? And so I think I've learned to navigate when he's in a certain type of mood, like I shouldn't push him or like pressure him to, yeah, to do something or feel another type of way because it just takes time. Sometimes it just takes
[00:18:30.720] time for him to like get out of that mood. And it's like same thing for me. I know that in certain situations, especially with conflict, I'm not really great at dealing with it head on right away. Like I need time to process my thoughts and think about it before I can come back to you with like a logical formed idea. So I think once you start to get to know the person really, really well,
[00:18:54.520] you can almost kind of predict how those situations are going to go and you can actively avoid them. I think what you said too, you can almost like call it out at the beginning. And so rather than having the situation continue to play out, you can call it out at the very beginning. And you know, it's like a bit meta, right? Like it's like almost breaking the fourth wall in a way. And it sort of diffuses the tension sometimes.
[00:19:19.620] Yeah, I really like the point too about like, you know, your own personal triggers to the anger thing for me, I think sometimes it's like a defense mechanism. Deep down, I might be like you said, disappointed, but the trigger like the emotion that is quickest is anger. And I think a lot of therapy work has also helped with that. I feel this way now, but what do I really actually feel? And then you know not to go into a conflict, thinking you're angry when actually you're sad, thinking you feel betrayed, but actually you wish that they did this or something.
[00:19:48.960] And knowing yourself, knowing them, knowing what kind of communication works between you two as like a pair also helps a lot. I was also thinking while you were describing all this that once you're kind of in that like long-term relationship, it's been a while. I think it also does get easier to bring stuff up. And sometimes you kind of forget how hard it was maybe in the beginning, like how nervous you were to like bring something up. And I think that's such a common thing.
[00:20:17.180] And so I guess to combat it, which is once again, easier said than done to just like bring it up no matter what, instead of letting it fester in your mind kind of, oh, I'll just bring it up later when it becomes unbearable. And then I feel like, I feel like if you do it that way, it's easier or more likely to lead to some sort of more explosive reaction or just like something that becomes more dramatic than it needed to be.
[00:20:45.640] That's a good point. Cause that line of thinking is also like, I'm just going to wait till my absolute breaking point to like address this issue with you, which kind of sets you up for failure a little bit. I think before you kind of find the balance of, you know, when you've been together for so long, you like know each other so well, like before you get to that point, sometimes it's really scary to bring up an issue because you, I don't know. I mean like every relationship is different, but maybe,
[00:21:12.860] you know, some people might have fears of, is this going to hit the breaking point? You might break up because of it, or it might be scary because, because you don't know the other person as well. So you're not sure how they're going to react and if it's going to be like a good conversation or not. So I feel like for me, I would always in the beginning tell myself, I'm chill. Like, this is not a problem. Like it's only a problem because I'm making it a problem,
[00:21:37.620] you know? So as long as I'm cool with it, it's okay. And I would just keep telling myself this over and over again until at some point I hit my breaking point and I'm like, okay, I can't do this anymore. But it's like, obviously I had such, you know, a long time of festering that emotion that now it's like completely blown out of proportion. So you should definitely talk about it
[00:22:03.020] at the beginning. Dude, I'm chill is so funny. Dude, I feel like that's such a common thought though. You're like, okay, honestly, it wasn't that bad. I'm cool with it. And then eventually, like three months later, you're like, how did we get here? But I think like a good way to kind of think about this is the sooner you bring it up, the sooner you get to know the other person faster. And then to kind of go with the map analogy, like the sooner you map out the map. Do you guys think
[00:22:32.340] it would help? And this is so theoretical slash experimental, but there are problems that I think are way easier to talk about. Like, oh, I don't like when you chew with your mouth open, for example. It's like not that offensive, right? And there's problems that are way bigger. Like, oh, I don't like the way you act around your friends where it's like fundamentally, it's like offensive. Do you think it's a good idea to test the waters with an easy fight or an easy
[00:22:56.020] conflict first? And then you like, train the algorithm between you two of like a good fight? I never thought of it. Dude, it's literally machine learning. You learn from every fight, you know? And you're the machine. People are AI. Oh my god. You know what, Jisoo,
[00:23:16.460] I'll test out this theory for you. I'll report back later. True. Jisoo will not have another chance to test this out. It's gotta be someone else. I guess maybe, I wonder if most relationships naturally progress in that way. Because like, I guess stuff like, I don't like the way that you act around your friends is probably not something that you're going to even get the chance to witness
[00:23:43.210] until a little bit later in the relationship. It might be stuff like, oh, I don't like how you act around my friends or like around my family, around your family, you know, something like that, where those harder conversations, you know, naturally occur slightly later in the relationship when hopefully you've had a little bit of experience, you know, resolving conflict and issues between you. So, but we'll see about Crystal's data points. Yeah.
[00:24:08.810] I guess also, it's hard to tell sometimes for like a fresh relationship, because probably both sides are like, I'm chill. We're good. So if someone does bring something up, they might be like, oh, yeah, that's chill. But like, you know, like, maybe it's different if it got brought up, like, say a year later. It's like, it's no longer chill, you know? That's true. Like, some people are like, oh, like, why didn't you tell me sooner?
[00:24:37.210] Or this makes me think of too, when I recall like the early stages of our relationship, or like previous relationships, one of the things that happens is when you're kind of, I don't want to say gaslighting, but when you're trying to like calm yourself down from an emotion you feel and tell yourself that it's just all in your head and not a real issue. One of the things I used to do is like text a friend and be like, oh my God, it kind of bothers me when this happens, or like when he does this,
[00:25:03.690] what do you think about this issue? And then I would talk to them about it. And that is definitely something that's really helpful in a lot of cases. But sometimes it makes the issue a bigger deal than it is. And then also your friend has a negative perception of your boyfriend now. And that's a really delicate balance that I've really tried to learn over the years of like, how much of this is, you know, me making a space to like vent and get feedback and like advice and
[00:25:32.210] how much of this is damaging certain bonds or like the perception of my boyfriend with my friends and how much of it is making the deal so much bigger than it is when really it could have been resolved just by like talking to my SO. With a therapist now, I feel like, you know, you can just go to your therapist, like they're never going to meet your SO probably. They're like a truly neutral party and stuff. But like with your friends, you always want to be on the side of your girlfriend, right? It's like, I'm not going to be like, oh, you're toxic AF. I'll be like, oh no, like fuck that
[00:26:00.730] guy. Or, you know, like at best it's like, oh, maybe try to talk to him. That's probably like the most positive advice. So that's kind of hard too when you try to make the issue too internal. Yeah, that's a good point. Also though, is this just an issue with society? Because I feel like girls try to rationalize issues a lot because they don't want to come off as quote unquote crazy. True. I actually wrote something similar in my journal.
[00:26:32.090] As I was going through some shit like last year. Okay, I literally wrote in my journal, is this me overcompensating as a woman? Am I being healthy? Or is this considered trying to put his feelings above my own? I think my thought process there was similar to women trying to sort of rationalize their feelings a little bit more, and trying to make things not as big of a deal because we don't want to come off as crazy,
[00:26:58.990] or being like, you know, that crazy girlfriend or whatever. I think for me in this moment, I was thinking that sometimes women are also, you know, very used to pandering to men's emotions, and trying to kind of play the situation and like, really be in tune with what the other person might be feeling. And so you can either respond to that, you know, and a lot of it comes from like a
[00:27:25.650] defensive sort of stance, right? Because you want to protect yourself. And so for me, a part of it was like, oh, am I trying to calm down the situation as much as possible, so that he doesn't get angry, he doesn't, you know, feel annoyed or anything like that. And that's kind of like a red alert going off in my head, right? Or is this like a true problem that deserves both of us to talk about it?
[00:27:51.290] Am I overcompensating this? Or is this just me trying to, is this like a real issue? You know? Right. Yeah, I totally feel that because I feel like there's so many thoughts that run through your head. And I don't know if guys necessarily think so deeply and like long term, and feel as much as like women tend to, but it's like you're trying to calculate, is this a real issue or not? But I think like long term, this is someone who is like your life partner, sort of. So like getting you and
[00:28:19.690] your partner to that stage where you talk about these things is like the ultimate challenge of like a healthy relationship. It's like, how can we deal with conflict together in a way that's constructive and pushes us forward and doesn't hold us back? Mm hmm. I think one of the realizations for me is like, I can be a pretty sensitive person. You know, I've been working out a lot of things through therapy. There's so many times where I feel like really validated in my emotions. And then later when I think about it, and I'm not in
[00:28:48.390] my emotional spiral, I'm like, oh, I definitely overreacted. So mine is probably the opposite of what Jessica was going through. I was like, okay, I do need to reel it back because I can't just be like, lack of a better word, picking fights all the time, sort of with like the person I love the most. And my therapist was like, are you bringing up issues at like nighttime in bed when he's like about to fall asleep? And then that's when my emotions are the highest probably. And that's when
[00:29:15.850] his emotional capacity is the lowest, right? And then I was like, I am. And she was like, let's not do that. And I was like, okay. And then after I switched that, I feel like it did fix things. So I think for us, like sometimes the fix is simple, but if you think about it, it's like being considerate about the other person and also setting yourself up for success for the fight, sort of. Kind of a different issue from yours, Jessica, but the opposite spectrum a
[00:29:41.090] little bit. Whoa, that's so interesting. Yeah, I actually do relay a little bit because for the last year and a half, we've been LDR, obviously. A lot of the fights, we all not, you know, like whenever we have stuff to talk about, you know, talk through, it's always through FaceTime or like calling, right? Which is obviously not the best medium to do it, but there's no other option. I guess for the listeners who don't know, he's currently in med
[00:30:09.050] school and he obviously has a very rigorous and busy schedule all the time. So he like gets up really early and he'll come home really late. And it's pretty much he's at the clinic or the hospital and then he comes home, he eats, he works out and he like talks to me and then just goes to sleep. Although sometimes he, you know, he still has time to get, but anyway, that aside, but there were, I know, right? Bombastic cyanide.
[00:30:40.590] But there were a couple times where there were issues that I wanted to bring up and I'm thinking about it all day at work, you know, and I'm like going about my day thinking about it and it's like, oh great. Now he's finally home from work. Like now we can hop on FaceTime and talk about it. But it didn't occur to me until we actually went through this that like, oh, he's coming back from a really, really long work day. Like he's exhausted. He's really tired. And if I try to sort of push this,
[00:31:10.510] it's not conducive to having a really good conversation about what's wrong. And he's also, I think somebody who just shuts down naturally when he's really tired. And so that also just doesn't help the situation. So instead we picked like a better time to recall and like re-talk about it where he's not super tired after a really, really long day. Well, it is difficult because
[00:31:36.190] obviously we both work and we both have a pretty like rigid schedule in terms of like when and when we're not available. So it's a little bit more limited, but definitely to your point of like, you know, not picking fights at when your partner is the most like vulnerable and like tired and like has no emotional capacity to deal with it is probably, you know. It's a good tip. It's like kind of a simple tip in the grand scheme of things, but so easy to overlook because when you're
[00:32:03.870] like in your feels, you're just focused on your feelings. And so it's so easy to be like, oh, we need to talk about this now because it's bothering me so much. But then the better course of action is to choose like a really appropriate time for everyone. Dude, I'm just imagining like Vince on a run and he's like waiting until he gets that runner's high. And as soon as he gets it, he's like, okay, this is the perfect time to address this conflit.
[00:32:30.790] It's like, I'm at my happiest. Like Jessica, it's like still early. We're going to talk about this now. Oh my God. I would probably be like, what the fuck? And also he always listens to audiobooks when he runs. So he would never call me. So kind of off on a tangent from like actual arguments or discussions, do you think there's
[00:32:58.030] been any like healthy habits actually that you've picked up from your partner or you've seen your partner do that you're like, oh, you know what? I should start doing that too. Yeah. I think there's a couple of things that I've learned from James over the years. And I think I learned these things more intimately after we started living together because when we weren't living together, it's mostly like dates or hanging out and stuff like that. But
[00:33:24.450] when you're living together, there's so many more things that you see about your partner and so many more things you learn about his like mindset or how his like brain works pretty much. So I've kind of talked a little bit about how my emotions can be a little trigger happy sometimes. You know, sometimes when I feel something, I feel it intensely and the action that triggered it might be pretty bitimal. I just like go into like a thought spiral where
[00:33:49.990] it's not productive at all. And I'm just like hyper focused on it. It like ruins the rest of my day pretty much when in reality, it might not have much intention from the other person, you know, to and from hangouts or like events or things like that. When James and I are in the car, I might be like, Oh, this person said this thing that really offended me. And I feel like they said this because they have this impression of me. And their intention was this I have a whole fucking
[00:34:16.410] thesis in my head for no reason about this thing. Because that's just how my brain works sometimes. And James will be like, Oh, maybe they were just having a bad day, because they mentioned that this happened earlier in the day, you can't really be happy after something like that. So don't worry about it. And at first, I would be like, you're just like, invalidating my emotions. And it like, hurts my feelings, because you're not hearing what I'm saying, like, this was really offensive. And then later, I was like, that's so true. Because like, imagine how many people I've pissed
[00:34:44.770] off when I'm just in a bad mood. And I'm just trying to go home or something. And I say something like, that comes off Kurt, and it really meant nothing. I was just fucking tired. So I think that kind of mindset really helped me a lot, where I'm like, Okay, let's not freak out over nothing. And just channel my inner James, where he does not give a fuck. He's so chill. And when he's offended, he almost like laughs it off is like, Oh, well, that's on the other person anyway. We can all channel our inner James. Yeah.
[00:35:16.550] It's just it's just so easy and fun to spiral. I know. It's the path of least resistance. How about you guys? Okay, I think there are definitely a lot of healthy mindsets and habits that I've seen him display.
[00:35:37.510] I don't know how many of them have rubbed off on me a lot. But I can say that I appreciate a lot of different habits and like mindsets that he has. And I really, really appreciate his way of sort of like looking at life. I think one of them is like, he's a very intrinsically motivated person. That's kind of why I say like, I don't know how many of them have like, actually rubbed off on me, because some of
[00:36:04.930] them is just like, I feel like you can't choose to be intrinsically motivated. It's just you just kind of are. And I am not intrinsically motivated. But he's a type of person where once he decides to live a certain way, or like integrate something into his life, he has no problem doing it. He has no problem following through. And I think that while you know, I can't change myself being like,
[00:36:32.930] you know, I need certain external motivations to get me going. But I think it does inspire me a lot to kind of see the world in a different way and sort of to not be as afraid of taking action sometimes. And it does inspire me to kind of see that like, you know, if I really wanted to do something, I can just do it. Like I can just sit down or go out or like stand up or whatever verb, and I can just go do it. And I think he embodies that a lot. Another thing that I thought about
[00:37:01.830] that I do think has rubbed off on me quite a bit is that he is like the most non judgmental person I've ever met. Like he is so good at just taking things at face value and just not putting any stories behind why someone did something or like why something is the way that it is like it just
[00:37:27.890] is. Even when people are like rude or offensive or doing something that's like kind of weird. I think there's pros and cons to that, obviously. And I always tell him that like, you know, you need to do a better job of breeding people. You're very gullible. But I think at the same time, I mean, I admire it a lot where it's like, he can see people just like, as people and he doesn't come with any sort of preconceptions about whatever, or this person is like this type of person because
[00:37:56.830] they, they did this, this and this. He finds a lot of humor in that. I think after meeting him, I've also tried to and sort of naturally also just found a lot more humor in living life in general, and found things that maybe previously I would have been, oh, like why this the way that it is? Or like, why did this person do this? But instead, I'll kind of be like, oh, wow,
[00:38:23.670] like I can't believe this person did that. Like, that's so cringe and funny. And like, I mean, maybe not cringe, because that's kind of judgmental. But you know, like, it's just like, oh, it's like a funny thing that happened. And it's not good or bad. It just is. And I think that's something that, yeah, I really admire about him. I really love that. Because I think that's one of the ways that your partner can really bleed into your life in a positive way, where it's like, you and him have completely different worldviews,
[00:38:53.650] and maybe like different attitudes about certain things. And the way you bring out the positives in each other, and maybe complement each other a little bit, is kind of the embodiment of like how a really good, well functioning relationship works. You're not judging him for his worldview, and he's not judging you. But you bring out the balance in each other a little bit. And especially like finding a partner who makes you see the world in a more positive way. That's like not an easy feat,
[00:39:20.090] because that's like your base view sort of. So I really like that one. How about you, Crystal? I've been kind of thinking, maybe like, similar to what we've all been saying, kind of just like a positive attitude in general, I think is just like nice to see. I think being very encouraging, along with that positive attitude is also something that's just like, very appreciated. And I think when
[00:39:49.670] you're exposed to that enough, it helps you start to think in those ways as well and kind of give it back as well. So it becomes a feedback loop. So then hopefully, you and your partner are just like encouraging each other with like good vibes to do what needs to be done. All right. So as a closing question, I have one for y'all. What are some indicators,
[00:40:18.090] especially earlier on in the relationship where you're like, yes, okay, this relationship is now healthy, or it has potential to be really healthy in the future? I think in the beginning, if you get like, genuine care and concern from each other, where it's like, I want to make sure that like, this is going well. And like, I want to make sure that you feel good about this relationship. They don't have to explicitly say that. But like,
[00:40:46.170] if you can see the actions and like, see the direction of that general sentiment, then I feel like those are some pretty good signs in the beginning. I think on that note, too, similarly, I think it's a very tight balance. But being willing to have like mutual sacrifices. Because I think a lot of people have like a misconception that in a relationship,
[00:41:15.650] both people need to make sacrifices for each other, or it has to be like very balanced or something like that. But I feel like in reality, there are times when one person has to sacrifice a little more than the other person. And then that may switch where the other person will have to sacrifice a little more for the sake of your lives together or the relationship or some person's like some one
[00:41:42.630] person circumstances or whatever. And I think it is always switching up and changing depending just on like more macro factors. But I think it's the willingness to do that for each other. And to not count tallies in your head, where you're like, Oh, I did this for you. So I'm expecting something in return. When you're both willing to make sacrifices for each other and support each other in whatever
[00:42:08.990] capacity the other person needs, and not have it be like a competition or like something where you're seeking something in return, I think is very much pointing towards like a healthy relationship. Oh, I have a funny one. There's this trend that's going on on TikTok. It's called the three month rule, which is basically when you start talking to someone or like start going on dates or whatever,
[00:42:37.950] you should wait until three months or later to see if they're still like nice to you and like things are still going well. Because the theory is that if someone were faking it, they wouldn't have the willpower to like keep faking it beyond three months. And then that's when they're like true self would come out. So I guess that's like if they last longer than three months, then that could potentially be a good sign.
[00:43:06.710] I kind of like that one because it does tie in a little bit to the one I was thinking, which is consistency. I've been in relationships in the past where there was love or like some sort of deviation of love. But I think people call it love bombing now where it's like the love was really intense some parts and the other parts they didn't give a fuck or like maybe I didn't give a fuck or something. And it's like, I just couldn't envision like long termness in that relationship,
[00:43:34.090] right? Because there's so many big swings, ups and downs. I think with James, he's like a very consistent person. And I'm like slightly inconsistent because of like mood swings and hormones and whatnot. But it like works. And I've learned to like try to be a little bit more consistent. So I think that goes along a little bit with like dependability, really feeling like, you know, the other person instead of like 50-50, they will love me today or they won't love me today. So that kind of trust,
[00:44:03.910] I think is really important in a healthy relationship. I like that. Well, thank you so much, Jessica, for joining us this week.
