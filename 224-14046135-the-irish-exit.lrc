[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal So this is actually a big episode for us because it's our last episode of the season last episode of the year and Rejoining everyone in January next year because I am getting married
[00:00:30.790] We talked about my upcoming wedding a bunch this year, but it's actually finally happening soon So we'll head out of the season a little bit earlier this year But hopefully next year we'll be back with a bigger and better season for you all. Woohoo
[00:00:45.410] Yeah, I'm excited and I think it just made the most sense because weddings are a lot of work So at the time that we're recording this we're getting really close to the wedding not to freak you out Jeesoo
[00:00:55.730] Oh my god, I feel like every time I see someone they're like, oh my god the wedding so soon Are you excited? And I'm like, I don't know if excited is the right word, but I do feel something
[00:01:06.010] It's like every time we see you you just have a panic attack Like don't talk about the wedding. Don't talk about the wedding We had like a dinner earlier and we were like, all right, we're banning the word wedding
[00:01:19.370] Like no one mentioned the wedding. Yeah, dude, it's stressful But I think because everyone else is so excited it does give me a little bit of excitement
[00:01:28.050] So, you know always that balance of making sure everything goes well enough but also feeling the joy and excitement of these things well, our topic today is actually kind of relevant because Most of our longtime listeners know we take a break around this time
[00:01:44.210] Anyway, usually we do it two weeks into December so this time we're leaving a little early and we considered not really saying anything and just letting it happen and That's very relevant to our topic because our topic is the Irish exit
[00:02:01.390] The Irish exit to me is something that I Associate so heavily with crystal like I think crystal to me is one of the people who pulls off the Irish exit very well You pull it off. Well in a way, that's kind of funny
[00:02:14.030] I feel like every time you pull it off I can just imagine you breathing like a sigh of relief or something Like it's not like effortless like you kind of put effort into it. So as the Irish exit expert crystal Can you please define this phrase? Yeah, sure
[00:02:29.230] So the Irish exit is just when you leave quietly without telling anyone So usually this is for like, you know bigger gatherings Parties things like that literally just don't say bye to anyone and you just leave So are there exceptions to this rule?
[00:02:47.510] Is it still an Irish exit if you leave without saying bye to most people but say you Stop to check in with like the person who invited you or the host to let them know that you're leaving. Ooh Okay, technically that would make it not an Irish exit
[00:03:03.430] But I feel like if there's a like you only told one person Loki it kind of still is an Irish exit, right? Cuz like the idea is deep into the party or whatever people will just be like, oh wait
[00:03:16.590] Where did this one person go and everyone's just like I don't know like I guess they must have left So whenever I think of this Concept I always think of you know that like Homer Simpson meme where he's slowly retreating into the bushes It's so accurate
[00:03:34.110] I've seen the way Irish exits work out really well, especially if you are maybe Drinking with a lot of people like a bigger group then one It's easier to kind of slip away without someone noticing and that hubbub and craziness and the chaos of a lot of people
[00:03:49.150] But I think also the flip side of it is that for girls I wonder if it's a little bit harder because as a woman I feel like if my girlfriends disappeared then I would be really worried if they didn't tell me that they were leaving
[00:04:02.110] Versus if a guy disappeared, I'd be like, okay like I guess you just left That's true. So maybe it's like easier if you Irish exit with someone. Oh True Yeah, I think like the ultimate goal is that you Irish exit at a point where you know
[00:04:19.390] Maybe people are starting to get more drunk So then they don't notice at first and then when you reach the point of the party where most people are gone Then the thought is oh they must have just left with the big wave. Oh
[00:04:34.310] That's smart. So it's very unnoticeable. Yeah, that's probably the most ideal Result of an Irish exit For you since you've actually used this tactic in the past Would you say it's easier to Irish exit from a party?
[00:04:52.010] So say I like someone's house or someone's apartment or is it easier to Irish exit when you guys are out and about so like Bar hopping for example. Oh my god
[00:05:00.830] Wait, actually bar hopping might be easier because in between the hopping you can just leave. Oh, that's true Just half-heartedly wave but then like no one sees you and you're like, that's Irish exit
[00:05:14.510] Yeah, cuz it's kind of chaotic sometimes when you're leaving the bar to go to the next one, right? I think that's the perfect opportunity, especially slightly later in the evening when people are a little less coherent Like suddenly at the next bar
[00:05:30.110] You only need six seats instead of seven and then people will just be like, oh, why did I think we had seven? And then just carries on. Oh See, okay I have a counterpoint to this because I feel like if I'm at someone's house for example
[00:05:46.030] And it's like a big party usually what happens I think is like There's a bunch of people in the living room people in the kitchen people in the dining room people in like bedrooms and stuff So it's like, you know
[00:05:55.510] Each part of the house has like a different number of people and the people are always like filtering through I feel like when there's separation of the rooms like that It's easier to Irish exit because if I don't see you in the living room
[00:06:05.870] I might be like Oh crystals in the bathroom or she's like in the kitchen or like she might be talking to these other people Or something like that, right? But the issue with house parties sometimes is that The exit is right in front of everyone. Ah
[00:06:20.030] That's there's only one door And then it's like oh like people will notice if you know the front door opens or something But if like the area where people are gathered is not near the front door then I think it's a little easier to exit
[00:06:36.990] My god, dude, you know how some people's houses like the parents put up a security system So every time the door opens, oh, yeah Dude, mine mine does that? I'm just imagining you trying to Irish exit and the bells like ding ding ding
[00:06:51.590] Yeah, that's true, but I guess there is Some methods to do it in in like a house party Like maybe you go to the backyard and it's normal to be in the backyard Right, maybe and then from the backyard you escape out the like side
[00:07:09.910] Are you jumping the fence or there's like the front gate to the back backyard, right? So that's one option Wait, I guess you could literally jump the fence But I think like the backyard fences tend to be like kind of creaky or you know, not super fluid
[00:07:28.510] So I can see that being a pretty noisy exit potentially but people are allowed when they're talking That's true but it's like okay I need you to explain this to me because I would say that one of the things that I kind of enjoy about
[00:07:42.750] parties or like going out with people is I kind of like saying bye to everyone at the end because it's like oh, you know because I think I like the
[00:07:52.190] Hugging of it all it's like that. I'll see you next time and you just like exchange sweet words with each other especially when you're with people who Say you don't see them super often in your life
[00:08:03.030] So to me, it's kind of like a meaningful point of the night Of course the greeting part like talking to them the whole night whatever but also when you depart it leaves like a conclusion Sort of for all the conversations that you had
[00:08:15.550] So to me, that's one of the deterrents of not wanting to do the irish exit because you would miss that so for you What would you say is like the main pull or like the main draw of the irish exit?
[00:08:28.110] Okay, sometimes when you go and say bye to people they're like no don't go Come have one more shot with us and then You know, maybe you're like, okay One shot we're ubering back anyway
[00:08:44.910] And then somehow next thing, you know, it's one hour later. You're playing rage cage You still haven't left right so I think it depends on who the host and guests are and also your timing So if you do it too early and people are too sober
[00:09:02.590] They'll be like wait, you can't leave yet. The party just started right? But if you leave a little too late they might also be like wait like you need to take another drink with us Play this game with us before you leave, you know something of that sort
[00:09:17.550] And then it also depends on the people themselves. Like are they people who would be more prone to Asking you to stay for quote unquote one more drink one more game
[00:09:28.510] Whatever or are they the type of people that be like, oh, yeah, like you should get home and rest All very fair points I guess it makes sense because sometimes the night definitely does drag on and if you have responsibilities the next day or
[00:09:42.910] You just don't want to stay out past a certain hour of the night that it makes sense to kind of irish exit I think also if you don't really know anyone too well, it's a little easier to irish exit
[00:09:55.790] Especially if you can't find the host, you know, sometimes you're forced into irish exiting. That's true That's not even like yeah, that's like not even a choice at that point. It's just like I tried
[00:10:08.590] I tried to regular exit and then you can send a text in the morning and just be like oh my god It was so fun last night Thank you for hosting. Yeah Do you think it's easier to irish exit when you're by yourself?
[00:10:21.870] Or do you think it's like harder or easier to irish exit if you have a friend or a boyfriend or a group of friends? I guess So group definitely hard like you don't want to leave and then suddenly people are like, oh why does it feel so empty?
[00:10:38.510] But I think if you're with one other person It's a little easier and maybe it makes you feel a little more Brave, I guess You know you're in it together you plan out your plot, you know, you time it and you leave you have the support
[00:10:55.150] And I guess if two people step out of the house together even if it's like through the front door and people are watching It's like somewhat normal. Like I wouldn't immediately assume that they were leaving
[00:11:04.270] I'd be like, oh maybe they're grabbing something from their car or just you know talking outside or something like that So it could be a little bit less suspicious. I guess if you have a small group It's also doable because if you step out I don't know
[00:11:17.310] Maybe you're taking a smoke break or like you said you're grabbing something from the car or you're just getting out To get some fresh air right and then you just never come back I can definitely see the the courage part too because
[00:11:31.230] I feel like I would have a lot of doubts of like, oh is it rude if I don't say bye or like Is it appropriate for me to exit like this? So what do you think kind of help you gauge?
[00:11:41.470] Is this okay for me to irish exit here? Okay, a lot of it honestly is why am I leaving? usually it's maybe I'm leaving a little earlier or i'm desperate to go home or something And you have to think you have to weigh Is it worth it?
[00:12:00.030] I could stay and you know have some fun with my friends or I could go home and rest up and you know Be all tucked into bed within the hour Depends on your mood That's true and I guess the other thing too is like
[00:12:14.030] For me, the biggest thing probably is saying bye to the host or the people who invited me so just gauging how Distracted they are or like how? Present they are at the time I guess if they're like really committed to like a drinking game for example
[00:12:27.710] Or like having a really deep conversation with someone or like in some sort of social trance that I don't want to break Then that could even be almost more rude than to just irish exit like distracting them from whatever that they're doing at the time
[00:12:40.430] So for the most part i'll try to say bye But I guess I could see the irish exit working if i'm like, oh well, they're so busy There's not you know a true point like me going up and interrupting them to say bye
[00:12:51.950] Yeah, and if you think about it, honestly, you do irish exit from things but you don't realize it's an irish exit So for example like an event Maybe like a charity event or something And you go and you have your fun or whatever
[00:13:09.710] Maybe you don't know anyone and you're just there with a friend or two. You're just like, okay, let's leave Oh, that's like irish exiting too, right? That's true
[00:13:17.790] That's a good point actually or like if your friend invites you to something and you don't like the friend knows the host But you don't you know, I wouldn't really say bye to the host because I don't really know that person
[00:13:27.390] So yeah, I guess that's true. I think it's it's harder to pull off for Events where you personally know the host It's also maybe used more commonly than you realize You're like end the stigma on irish exit
[00:13:45.330] Also a funny thing about the irish exit is that I actually first learned of it as the french exit. Oh And apparently that's how the people in the uk call it here in the states. We call it an irish exit
[00:13:59.650] Wait now that you say that I think one of our book club books was called the french exit It was like a book we read a couple months ago
[00:14:06.850] I never connected it to the irish exit and I feel like it makes more sense how I learned it the french exit because the french have like a bit of a stigma or like stereotype of being blunt and sometimes almost rude
[00:14:22.770] So I was like, oh this makes total sense like that. This is named the french exit But irish people are actually Their stereotype is they're super like friendly and welcoming, right? So I thought it was funny that it's called the irish exit here
[00:14:37.890] You're like does this make it easier for me to use it because i wish you were super nice but I guess that kind of brings up the Question of like when is the irish exit rude? I think from my perspective as a host
[00:14:52.130] I don't usually host people that I don't know Usually everyone who comes over to our place are like our good friends or I guess at the highest degree of separation It's maybe like a friend of a close friend who i've met a bunch of times
[00:15:04.930] If people were to come to our place and then irish exit, I feel like that would feel a little bit odd But that's because the people we're hosting are like people who I would expect to come and say like bye to me
[00:15:16.690] And I don't mind getting interrupted if someone's leaving uh, they want to say bye because it's just you know part of the hosting process and whatnot, but yeah, I guess it's not something that I
[00:15:27.090] Prefer and i've actually I don't think I can really remember a time where people really irish exited But maybe that just goes to show That they did it really well Yeah, I don't think
[00:15:40.450] I'm, not sure if i'm aware of anyone irish exiting your place either. Wait, I do remember it was like my birthday. Oh Okay, the thing is like since me and james host as a couple too
[00:15:54.130] I feel like if someone says bye to james that that's like good enough Okay for the most part like sometimes I might actually be busy or something So right as long as our unit is getting like, you know, someone is yeah
[00:16:06.530] Okay, so I think what i've done before at your place is i'll tell you i'm leaving but then i'll just quietly leave Yeah, yeah, but back to the like when is it rude I do think if it's a small gathering and you know everyone yeah
[00:16:23.330] It's like kind of rude to just leave especially if it's more intimate Like you're at someone's home So for example, if we were at your place for like a dinner and there's I don't know seven people I would probably feel extremely rude if I just left That's true
[00:16:41.010] And I guess like the smaller the group is I feel like the bigger the responsibility is for you to say bye to everyone actually For sure. I think i've only really irish exited when it's a large party and or I don't know too many people
[00:16:57.730] It makes total sense because it's just I don't know the idea of having to like weave through these crowds of people At like a really packed house party, for example
[00:17:06.370] To like grab the hose tell them you're leaving and then weave back out through the crowds to the front door Sometimes it's just like damn. I can't believe I have to spend the next like five minutes doing this Yeah
[00:17:16.690] Do you think it's an irish exit if you leave but then you send a text immediately after? Oh So I personally would consider that an irish exit because you didn't do like the proper like sign off basically but it still I think
[00:17:32.930] Cuts out a lot of that potential rudeness like if it was a situation where it could potentially be rude I think it is a alternative way to do it, dude
[00:17:41.490] Maybe you should just station yourself at the door next time. You're like, all right, if you're gonna leave you need to check in here I'm, sorry. You need to check out here. Wait, I didn't install like, you know, like the corporate badge in badge out systems
[00:17:53.490] Where the door only unlocks if you badge out It's like you need to put in a slip of paper that you hand out after they check out with you exactly That'd be so funny. Oh my god I think the other thing too for the irish exit is
[00:18:10.930] I feel like you can irish exit. Maybe the group you came with but not the party if that makes sense So for example, we've been talking a lot about oh You should probably say bye to the host and if you don't that's considered an irish exit
[00:18:23.970] But say you went to a friend's party and you don't really know this person that well but you went with like a group of four and then halfway through you're like
[00:18:31.890] I just want to leave and then you just like left then you're leaving like your carpool buddies, right? Like I feel like that would also be like an irish exit but just on a smaller molecular level
[00:18:41.650] You're right in a way. That is for sure an irish exit. Yeah Technically on the whole as well because you didn't tell anyone else. That's true
[00:18:50.210] But even if you told the host but not your carpool buddies, that'd be like kind of fucked up. That'd be so funny. Yeah They're like, okay, let's leave wait, where did where did Where'd they go? I do think though
[00:19:05.410] Kind of what you mentioned earlier sometimes when you need to pull off an irish exit There is a bit of plotting and planning involved Just imagine this, you know, you're trying to quietly leave Right now at the front door there just happens to be no one there
[00:19:23.330] So you rush to the door you're turning the knob you're getting ready to pull or push whatever but the door Is locked and you're like, oh shit. Okay. How do I use the lock? Yeah, okay
[00:19:32.770] And you're like, why do they have a complicated lock like one of those keypad ones and then on this side You like don't know if it's locked or unlocked
[00:19:41.330] And you don't know if you need like a phone to unlock it or if you can like manually unlock it You're just at this door like making a bunch of noise and eventually people are like, oh, what's that noise? They walk over and then you're like, oh, um
[00:19:57.170] How do you unlock this Wait i'm dying Dude, also I feel like there's a certain routine that you have to do So of course before leaving you have to pee and then there's been times where i'm like, okay
[00:20:09.010] We need to leave at like midnight. So then i'm like at 11 50 i'll go pee But then I go to the bathroom at 11 50. There's like a line Also, I think the important part is like even on the way to the front door
[00:20:19.650] Like you said sometimes that route is filled with minds where there's like a bunch of groups of people that you know And of course, it's lovely to like say bye But when you're kind of trying to make a mad rush out of something
[00:20:32.370] I feel like that's the worst because you have to stop and like have like a two to three minute conversation with each person You know, this is one of those things where an irish exit a true irish exit would be like a two-minute escapade
[00:20:44.770] But then now it's like a 20-minute exit out the door Oh my god in that scenario. Would you just be like, all right, fuck i'll just hold my pnp at home
[00:20:53.970] Fuck dude, I feel like we live decently far enough from most places of our friends where it's like not feasible But there's been times where at bars, especially Bar bathroom lines for girls crazy. I'm just like damn. Should I just hold this until I get home?
[00:21:10.770] And you know worst case there's always an option So I have like a random situational question sort of topical since the wedding is coming up, but Would you say that irish exiting at a wedding is rude or do you think it's acceptable? I think it's relatively acceptable
[00:21:32.370] especially if it's a big wedding it would take the Bride and groom a long time to get through to everyone and usually they've already put aside certain time to say hi to everyone so I feel like it's kind of normal like, you know,
[00:21:48.050] If you're kind of tired now or you're a little too drunk and you feel like you should go home there's no need to bother the host almost
[00:21:57.570] Yeah, i'm just imagining the bride and groom trying to have fun and then there's this huge line of people trying to say bye to them Before they leave so I I do think it is not unacceptable to irish
[00:22:12.130] Exit a wedding but you probably want to make sure you interacted with the host at least once. Oh, yeah That's a really good point because even if it's like one Minute per person for like saying goodbye that's already like over an hour if you have more than 100 guests
[00:22:29.250] I think that makes total sense it's kind of interesting too because Kind of what I was saying earlier about like oh for me and james like since we're a couple I feel like as long as you say bye to the unit, it's fine
[00:22:41.410] I feel like that can be applied to so many different things where like there's always like a core group of people It doesn't always have to be like romantic But it's just like the host and like their closest like nuclear group of friends
[00:22:52.610] I feel like as long as you let one of them know that you're leaving. It's like totally fine, right? That's fair. Yeah, if you tell someone you're leaving Also a counterpoint though
[00:23:03.730] When you imagine yourself at your wedding, do you feel like you want to know when every single person leaves no I definitely do not But I guess I would want At least someone at the wedding to know that this person left or something
[00:23:18.770] Like I just don't want people to go unaccounted unless they're like totally fine and stuff But right I just think once you add like alcohol or whatever into the mix It gets a little bit into like the safety territory
[00:23:28.470] But that being said I will not be offended if anyone just leaves the wedding You're like, sorry, um half of you didn't check out I'm like literally at the door
[00:23:40.550] Okay, but it's like some people I think I would expect them to say bye like really close friends, right? I would probably want some sort of goodbye, I think And those ones will probably stay till the end. Anyway, that's most likely. Yeah
[00:23:55.430] I mean you've gone to a few weddings this year. Have you always said bye to the Bride slash groom before you left? I stayed till the end for one of the weddings and of course I did say bye to her because we were like one of the
[00:24:07.910] Last people still there For the other two weddings, it was more of an irish exit, but I think we said bye to the parents Oh, that's a good one Yeah So that's you know
[00:24:18.630] Like part of like that nuclear group where it's like i'm checking out with someone not necessarily like the bride and the groom Right, right. Oh my god. Also, I do think though if you're Family with the person getting married. I don't think you should be Right
[00:24:34.630] That's a great point Unless you're like distant family, but I feel like usually if you're family and you're invited you have some closeness there you should probably Check in with at least someone else in the family core family before you leave I
[00:24:51.830] Guess like weddings are a little bit different from the normal party rules But I feel like as we talk through a lot of these exit strategies and whatnot i'm learning that i've like probably come a long way and I think you too as well, but
[00:25:04.790] For me when I first started going to parties or like hangouts in college I guess I wasn't sure what like the proper etiquette was and like now at the tender age of 27
[00:25:14.950] We're like able to sniff out what's normal and what's not and like what's rude and what's not But back then I just didn't know so then I remember I would irish exit a little bit more than I do now and then
[00:25:27.510] At most I would just check in with the host, but I wouldn't always say bye to like everyone at the party Yeah I started doing that a little bit more when I noticed that my other friends were kind of doing that
[00:25:37.030] Where they would say bye to the host and every single person that they knew at the party like knew well enough Anyway to say bye And I think that's why I started adopting that into my personal exit strategy
[00:25:47.350] But I will say it's like fully learned behavior. It wasn't like natural for me in the first place, you know I see i'm trying to remember What I did in the past
[00:25:58.870] Honestly, I think I just tagged along with whoever I was there with if they said we're leaving we're leaving But I don't necessarily say bye to people Maybe to whoever I was talking to in the moment
[00:26:12.550] And nowadays I don't irish exit too much but I have a couple times recently But I do think I happen to be more involved in like Smaller gatherings so I haven't had to like irish exit too much recently. That makes total sense
[00:26:29.990] I think for the most part that's me too but I will say there are times where I go to a gathering and it's like a lot bigger than I thought it would be And big for me is I think starting 30
[00:26:39.350] It's a little big and then like 40 plus is like this is a big party. Basically last night, I actually went to a Decently big party I said bye to the hosts which I think was the biggest thing and the people that I knew who were at the party
[00:26:52.790] So it was like the perfect timing to just grab my bag and leave so I went to the room that I put my bag in because usually I put it in like the bedroom of one of the hosts
[00:27:02.150] And I walk in and there's I kid you not like 12 people sitting in that room And I don't know a single person and I was like, oh my god And my bag is like right next to like the stranger's feet because it's not like a huge bedroom, right?
[00:27:15.910] So it's just like people are like squished there and I was like Sorry, can I grab my bag? And then someone was like, oh are you guys leaving or something? And it's like I guess they were just being polite So I was like, yeah
[00:27:27.510] They're like bye so like this room of 12 people They start waving bye to us and i'm like, oh my god, I don't want to make like this huge commotion I just wanted to like Grab my bag and leave quietly Wait, that's so funny
[00:27:41.350] Well, that's 12 new friends for you Okay, I have a funny situation yeah, have you ever seen the host irish exit Oh my god, I have actually I have and you were there too with me I think Oh my god, wait, which one are you thinking of? So
[00:27:58.710] This time we were at a friend's house and then chill night turned into like a very late night so I think we were there until like 4 a.m Or something like that and then I just remember at like 3 30 we looked around and we were like, oh where's so-and-so
[00:28:13.590] And then he had like gone into his bedroom and he was sleeping And the rest of us were just out there like talking chatting having like the time of our lives That's when we were like, okay, we should probably go
[00:28:23.830] Oh my god, you're right. I do remember that and there was actually something similar that happened Recently for me as well where I went to this party and the host she doesn't drink that much But it was like kind of a big party
[00:28:37.990] So she like got pretty drunk and so she just like quietly went to her bedroom and just went to sleep Oh my god, I actually accidentally caught her right before She curled up because I was like, oh if you're about to sleep
[00:28:52.390] I'm, sorry, but like because she had just put up like really nice decorations in one of her rooms Can I go look at it? And she was like, oh, okay. She like crawls out
[00:29:01.190] Like let me show you. Oh, that's so cute. Actually. Yeah, that was really funny because afterwards I was like, oh, i'm Sorry, I just remember to like go to sleep. I won't tell anyone Yeah Dude, there's something so funny about irish exiting in like your own house
[00:29:16.390] So you're just exiting to your bed. Yeah Literally doing like the full 12 step skincare routine as there's like 40 people in your kitchen. It's so funny I think irish exiting as a host is like extremely acceptable if anything Contrary to irish exiting as a guest
[00:29:35.670] Irish exiting as a host is such good host behavior because you're letting everyone still have fun But you're like i'm gonna retire though, right? You guys keep going But like, you know, don't let me stop you Yeah, totally
[00:29:50.390] It actually like means you trust the people that are there to like trust them I mean most people won't like fuck up your shit but it's like you trust them to like drink responsibly and get home safe and Not mess with your things and things like that
[00:30:03.830] And I I can't remember specifically but i'm pretty sure there's been a time where a hosh iris exited Everyone there like cleaned up and then we like all left or something like that. So, you know, sometimes it's not too bad
[00:30:14.790] I mean, that's ideal. I love it when guests help you clean up. Yeah So I feel like I have a little bit more insight now into the irish exit You know what's funny is we had initially talked about this episode concept a couple weeks ago
[00:30:29.110] And we recently scheduled the episode recording for it and I was like, oh perfect This is slotted right after this like huge party So i'm gonna try my best to irish exit this party and I really did try yesterday
[00:30:41.270] But it didn't work out because I had like a group of people that I came with But this will be on my homework list for the next few months to irish exit a party successfully I think you can do it
[00:30:53.270] I believe I I won't be offended if you irish exit Like a party I host as long as it's not too early. Yeah, I think if you leave early you should say bye But if it's like never leave early Yeah, that's true
[00:31:06.950] But yeah, if it's in the midst of the chaos, you know, the party's been going on for a while I wouldn't blame anyone for leaving I love that. So this is a psa to all my friends if I irish exit your party in the next few months
