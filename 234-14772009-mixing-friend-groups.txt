[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo, I'm Crystal, I'm Jonathan Welcome back, Jonathan
[00:00:19.000]  Last time you were on the podcast it was a little while ago's episode 179 and we talked
[00:00:25.160]  about being in law school which was a good episode so be sure to check that out if
[00:00:29.960]  anyone is interested in law school. We brought Jonathan on today to talk about mixing
[00:00:36.000]  friend groups but before that we have a Gen Z phrase to kind of talk about and I think
[00:00:41.360]  this one has been popping up a decent amount so it's like kind of popular especially
[00:00:45.960]  on TikTok now, the phrase is do it for the plot. The definition for this is basically
[00:00:52.920]  I would describe it as Gen Z's version of Yolo or just like fuck it, do it essentially
[00:00:59.680]  you're telling someone to like do it for the plot of your life right so like oh fuck
[00:01:04.320]  it just do it. I think it's also an extension of do it for the vine or do it for the
[00:01:10.160]  snap. I remember back then there was a really big deal to have funny Snapchat stories
[00:01:14.480]  essentially but now it's gone beyond the social media platforms and it's like actually
[00:01:20.040]  about our lives. Yeah dude I'm not gonna lie, I thought I was young and hip and up to date
[00:01:25.480]  all of this but I literally have not heard this at all before it's crazy.
[00:01:32.700]  I think this one is like pretty Gen Z specific millennials don't really use this one.
[00:01:38.640]  Oh my god are we getting old? It's funny because a lot of the ones that I've actually seen
[00:01:44.500]  would do it for the plot in the beginning when I first discovered this phrase it was all
[00:01:48.920]  millennials on TikTok like oh my god Gen Z's playing is so interesting. They keep telling
[00:01:53.880]  me to do it for the plot and I kind of feel good about that. That's like and that's
[00:01:59.680]  like how I first learned about it but now I'm like seeing it more in Gen Z TikTok well
[00:02:05.440]  you know I'm mostly on millennial TikTok. I feel like I like this phrase specifically
[00:02:11.560]  too because it incites so much chaos. It's like okay there's a reasonable option that
[00:02:16.920]  I would take but there's an option that would further the plot and like complicate things
[00:02:21.240]  and make things interesting so why don't you do that one? It's like it's a really easy
[00:02:25.500]  one to like go to your friends into doing something funny. Yeah just spice things up a bit.
[00:02:30.520]  Yeah yeah I think you're right it's usually used when someone's like oh my god try
[00:02:36.080]  do this like questional thing everyone's like do it for the plot. Okay so when's the last
[00:02:42.640]  time you guys did something for the plot? Oh last time I did something for the plot.
[00:02:47.320]  It's a very good question. Let me check my calendar. This is really boring if I'm going
[00:02:54.520]  to think of something I did for the plot it was truly just taking this career I'm doing
[00:02:59.200]  now because literally going into it I was like I don't even know what I'm doing but
[00:03:03.920]  fuck it let's do it for the plot I just kept going with the flow. I like that that's
[00:03:09.560]  a big one. Yeah but it's such a boring plot. Actually I think I kind of have one so the
[00:03:17.840]  person that I'm dating right now we were like kind of set up. I had the option when
[00:03:23.400]  the setup was getting brought up I could have been like oh no like I'm fine but I was
[00:03:28.240]  kind of like alright whatever fuck it. Yeah for the plot. Yeah look at your plot now.
[00:03:36.640]  I love these. I've like mine is so much of a smaller plot event compared to you guys
[00:03:42.000]  but last week it was James's birthday so we went out for a really nice dinner and then
[00:03:46.840]  we came back and we were like okay let's have a really relaxing hotel night in keep it
[00:03:51.880]  super special and then we fell asleep and then we woke up and then James was like okay
[00:03:57.680]  let's go clubbing because some of our friends had gotten a table so then we literally got
[00:04:02.800]  up from bed I redid my hair and like put on all our clothes and then we went out clubbing
[00:04:07.760]  at like midnight. That is crazy. It was I was like I'm never napped and then like gone
[00:04:13.240]  out before but that let's us getting sick so maybe the plot is not always positive.
[00:04:21.000]  The plot reindeer in. Yeah. Okay also the craziest part about that is James waking up and
[00:04:27.480]  being like let's go clubbing. Dude that's what I'm saying. I was like who is this man?
[00:04:32.440]  This is James at 28. 20. Unhinged. That kind of reminds me I think the last time
[00:04:40.760]  I did something for the plot was last minute I was like you know what fuck it I'll go to
[00:04:45.880]  EDC for like a day. This is like a day or two after my graduation. It was fun in the
[00:04:51.760]  moment but I remember before I went everyone's like posting stories you know a lot of people
[00:04:56.280]  were younger so they're posting the sunrise they have like crying face emojis they're
[00:05:00.040]  like can't believe it's over. The whole day I was like smack talking I was like dude that
[00:05:04.080]  is so degenerate. I can't believe people are sad that the sun is rising couldn't be us
[00:05:10.920]  it ended up being us. We're just sitting on the stands like cool off before leaving and
[00:05:14.440]  the sun starts coming up and everyone starts cheering and I was like oh my gosh guys we need
[00:05:18.500]  to get the fuck out of here dude. I was literally so tired. What was that phrase? It's like
[00:05:24.360]  you become what you hate or something. Exactly. I became the villain of my own story.
[00:05:29.880]  This city there listening to some fucking pots and pans with a throbbing headache going
[00:05:35.880]  like damn dude I just need to get out of this desert right now. Like I'm not young anymore.
[00:05:41.480]  Actually. Dude EDC is such a like it is a fucking journey. Yeah and then it's like you aren't
[00:05:49.080]  even able to sleep well once you get back home. And you got to drive home like in a few
[00:05:53.280]  hours. Yeah. Well plot events aside kind of want to bring us back to our topic today. So
[00:06:00.880]  today we really wanted to talk about mixing friend groups. I feel like there's a very specific
[00:06:06.720]  art to mixing friend groups. I know some friends of mine do it super super well and fluidly where
[00:06:13.040]  you don't even notice that there's multiple friend groups being mixed but it can be sort
[00:06:17.600]  of a high pressure thing for some people it could be a hobby for others. So I'm definitely excited
[00:06:22.000]  kind of dive through the intricacies of mixing friend groups with you guys today. Let's kind
[00:06:26.800]  of start this off by how often do you mix friend groups in your hangouts and what situations are
[00:06:33.440]  you most likely to consider mixing friend groups? Generally I feel like me and I guess most people
[00:06:41.760]  a lot of the friend group mixing comes in with like bigger events like maybe like birthdays,
[00:06:47.040]  weddings. The awesome friend mixer. Exactly. Or like you go to like a festival or something.
[00:06:55.920]  I think I'm probably similar to J.Soo. I don't usually host too many like mixed friend group events
[00:07:03.680]  unless it's like something kind of bigger like a birthday party but otherwise I just attend
[00:07:09.600]  friend mixing events. I think I totally agree with you guys where I don't mix friend groups that
[00:07:17.200]  often. I think especially smaller events I do not like mixing friend groups just because
[00:07:23.760]  the less people there are in an event and the more intimate the setting is. I feel like there's
[00:07:27.600]  more pressure for those people to get along versus in a bigger setting especially in like a party
[00:07:33.040]  setting maybe more birthday party it's just so much more casual people can separate if they want to,
[00:07:38.160]  people can vibe if they want to. So there's less of that like okay this group of six people need
[00:07:43.680]  to be best friends by the end of the night kind of pressure. That's fair. What about like if you
[00:07:48.960]  have one main friend group but then you want to invite someone who you're close to do do that often
[00:07:55.440]  or do you just think like fuck I'll just stick to the main friend group? I think I do that pretty
[00:08:00.720]  often. I think a big part of mixing friend groups is also your confidence in yourself that the
[00:08:07.280]  friends you make are all mostly similar to your personality even though I have like different groups
[00:08:13.200]  of friends. They all generally have very compatible personalities so it's like not hard to bring one or
[00:08:20.880]  two additional people and it's like if there's a main group of friends I'm like yo could I invite
[00:08:25.280]  like I don't know like one of my friends from high school and stuff they're like that down.
[00:08:29.680]  Oh my god but on that topic what if you're being invited to an event and then you're like oh can
[00:08:35.920]  I bring this one friend with me but then that one friend doesn't know anyone do you feel obligated
[00:08:42.960]  to stay with them the whole time? I think I would and it's not necessarily always like a negative
[00:08:49.120]  obligation of like oh I feel weighed down by the burden of having to carry this friend but it's more
[00:08:53.840]  of like I have a lot of social anxiety so then if I was a plus one I would probably like follow
[00:08:59.040]  whoever invited me around through the night see who their friends are and like kind of joining on
[00:09:03.760]  those conversations so hopefully if I'm the one inviting someone I'm able to like keep up with
[00:09:10.160]  my personal expectation as well. That makes sense. I think it's also if I'm gonna invite someone
[00:09:15.520]  I think I've already made up my mind by then of I'm gonna be sticking with this person and making
[00:09:20.800]  sure that they're getting along with everyone. I wouldn't invite someone and just like leave them
[00:09:25.920]  but I think one thing that makes it easier too is I think a lot of our friends are like this they're
[00:09:30.800]  very inclusive makes it easy to get along with them so like a lot of times if it's just like a big
[00:09:37.200]  group gathering and you invite one or two additional people I find like by the end of the night they're
[00:09:41.600]  like chopping it up with everyone else. I feel like it's easier to be a guest and bring some friends
[00:09:49.920]  versus like hosting sometimes in terms of like friend group mixing because as the host you can't
[00:09:56.160]  just stick with one group or person the whole night you kind of have to like trust them that they'll
[00:10:02.880]  try their best to like make all and socialize. That is true. I actually have like a bunch of thoughts
[00:10:09.200]  on kind of like the plus one thing though because I guess it depends on what it is if it's like
[00:10:14.640]  a very large and like anonymous party at like a residential neighborhood there's no space capacity
[00:10:22.160]  or like you know there's no thing that makes it kind of exclusive then it totally makes sense
[00:10:26.800]  to like bring a couple of friends or whatnot but sometimes I feel like invites are meant for just
[00:10:32.000]  you and yourself only so then bringing plus ones can be a little bit of like a stretching I guess
[00:10:39.200]  the other person's lenience. It's kind of like asking for something or like asking for a favor
[00:10:44.080]  so then I have thoughts on that a little bit like it really depends on the event type I think
[00:10:49.040]  yeah but I do feel like there's kind of like a time and a place to bring like plus ones or
[00:10:53.520]  plus a number of guests. That's a good point I didn't even think of it that way. I think I
[00:10:59.040]  completely misunderstood the question but you know I agree with you G-Soo and I think a big part
[00:11:05.680]  too is if I'm ever in that situation and I invite someone I would hit them with the it's totally okay
[00:11:12.560]  to say no I know you don't know them feel free to say no and they say yes I'm like just tell me if
[00:11:18.720]  you don't want them but I think a pet peeve of mine is in those instances if I'm inviting someone
[00:11:27.200]  or one of my other friends are inviting someone and then they asked to invite more people we can just
[00:11:32.240]  say no and no harm no foul but I would like if they gave me that out as well. I'm like you don't
[00:11:38.880]  have to say yes if you don't want to because I kind of feel like an asshole sometimes are just saying
[00:11:43.760]  no yeah but I think the older I've gotten the more okay I've been with no that's too many people
[00:11:50.640]  that's good. Drawing my boundaries yeah but yeah I feel like in my mind when these boundaries are
[00:11:57.520]  really strong is probably when it's like a much more intimate gathering and maybe it's like
[00:12:02.960]  a core friend group that you're like oh we haven't seen each other in so long let's keep it small
[00:12:09.440]  especially because I think the less people there are in a gathering accentuates the people who
[00:12:15.040]  are unknown if that makes sense like the you know the one person who is like a plus one doesn't really
[00:12:20.480]  know anyone but then everyone else is already like so close and such an intimate gathering.
[00:12:26.160]  I wonder in those cases like if the plus one feels even more out of place not necessarily
[00:12:32.800]  because people aren't welcoming but just because of the like context honestly crystal I think they
[00:12:37.760]  do feel more left out and I think in those situations if you really want to bring someone
[00:12:42.000]  I think it is your job or my job if I'm bringing someone like my job to make sure they integrate
[00:12:47.200]  with the group. I think one thing that I never really liked is you know if people invite me out
[00:12:53.520]  to like hang out with their core group I'm very grateful for it I end up having a blast but like
[00:12:58.640]  if they don't really make an effort to introduce me man that first hour is painful like so how do
[00:13:05.520]  you know so and so. Oh high school that's crazy oh you guys want to call it together that's sick
[00:13:11.520]  were you in the same major but it's like stuff like that yeah wait I feel like I've heard you have
[00:13:16.400]  this exact conversation like many times like this is so familiar to me. I literally have a list of
[00:13:21.920]  small talk talking points in my head and as soon as I meet someone I run through it some of my friends
[00:13:29.360]  like I'm sure you two have heard it other friends who I've known for a lot longer actually I've
[00:13:34.080]  known Jesus for really long. Other friends that have seen me in these social environments more they
[00:13:40.640]  as soon as they hear me say one thing they know the next question I'm gonna ask because it's just so
[00:13:45.680]  structured. They've got it memorized. They gotta memorize and then if I ask a certain question they're
[00:13:51.040]  like oh Jonathan's gonna say this story now. I say this story. Dude this is like NPC behavior.
[00:13:58.080]  It's like a decision tree that he's already mapped out. It honestly is yeah but it makes
[00:14:12.160]  it so much easier to just go like autopilot sometimes for sure and I mean like you can't blame some
[00:14:18.480]  of the small talk questions like some of them get really good information out and it does sometimes
[00:14:23.360]  spark a bigger or more complex conversation. Exactly I think too it's like these small talk questions
[00:14:31.360]  are also a litmus test on like how well you can get along with the person because if they respond
[00:14:36.880]  very well to it if I'm like oh how do you know this person and then they dive into it they're like
[00:14:41.120]  I've known it since elementary school we've been really close friends tells me some stories about it
[00:14:45.200]  I'm like I can really chop it up with this person yeah but if they're just like oh we just knew each
[00:14:49.760]  other from like college and that was it I'd be like cool like fuck me right I'll go now.
[00:14:56.320]  This also kind of reminds me of that meme of one mutual friend bringing two other friends together
[00:15:03.280]  and then the moment they leave like the lunch table or whatever the two are like so uh how do you
[00:15:09.760]  know this friend? 100% yeah yeah I feel like there's definitely an art to even when you do bring a guest
[00:15:18.000]  or like our primitive to bring a guest making sure that that guest integrates well and like has fun
[00:15:23.200]  because I don't know even if like the normal friend group is having fun if the one person who's a
[00:15:28.240]  plus one is not having fun in a corner I feel like that can also be like a mood dampener so it's
[00:15:32.560]  also for the social good as well to make sure that the plus that's having fun. That's probably why
[00:15:37.760]  it always works a little better in like a slightly larger party setting where you know there's
[00:15:43.120]  a bit of alcohol you know people are a little loosened up and feeling a little more relaxed so
[00:15:49.360]  it's a little easier to make conversation even if we like don't really make that much sense or
[00:15:54.800]  it's like very shallow conversation everyone's excited because they're in a good mood and the vibes
[00:15:59.680]  are good. A question for you guys how do you guys make sure that your friends or your plus ones
[00:16:07.200]  feel included in the group what is your strategy? This might be a little counterintuitive but I think
[00:16:13.440]  sometimes bringing like an S.O. I don't always want to be like oh this is my boyfriend or whatever
[00:16:20.400]  because then that makes everyone associate that person as like oh that's Crystal's boyfriend
[00:16:26.240]  not like that's their own person if that's the situation then I'll bring them and like maybe
[00:16:32.320]  introduce them a bit with me but then like at a certain point kind of like break off a little
[00:16:38.560]  bit if it's a bigger party just so that they can like establish themselves as their own person
[00:16:44.240]  and they can like you know go out and socialize as well and I think it also shows oh this person
[00:16:48.880]  has some social skills like a normal person like they don't have to rely on you fully in like a
[00:16:59.520]  social setting which I think is like a pro just to have as like a general skill. I think that's
[00:17:06.640]  a good tip especially when you're someone's S.O. you can definitely be doomed to being like just their
[00:17:12.400]  S.O. but I'm trying to think of like when I brought a friend to a different friend group hangout
[00:17:18.400]  for example I feel like the one thing I'll do is like when I introduce people I'll try to give
[00:17:24.240]  interesting tidbits about each other so that there's like some sort of starting point and then
[00:17:28.720]  they can kind of talk based on that or I'll also make sure to like sort of poke fun at the plus
[00:17:34.800]  one so that it's like in a normal friend group everyone's kind of like making fun of each other
[00:17:40.640]  so then I feel like by doing that to the plus one to it kind of like opens up the battle ground a
[00:17:44.800]  little bit and that's kind of like the easiest or like fastest way to get close to somewhat right.
[00:17:48.880]  Yeah I think for me I really similar to G-SOO I kind of just start shitting on people.
[00:17:54.160]  I think my relationship with my friends is a lot of them shit on me too so like a common thread
[00:17:59.680]  between all the friends I make is they all one way or another will end up shitting on me.
[00:18:04.800]  I will take it on the chin I'll take the fall but if everyone's shit talking me makes everyone get
[00:18:11.920]  closer then you know it makes it a lot easier. Like as long as it's friendly hopefully yeah I think
[00:18:18.160]  another good tactic is if you think there's someone who is like good at making friends good at
[00:18:24.960]  socializing you could be like oh let's all take a shot with that person and then I feel like
[00:18:30.720]  that kind of opens things up. Taking a shot together is somehow very like socially inclusive
[00:18:38.000]  I think and it usually makes people feel like a part of something so then I think from there
[00:18:43.520]  usually like conversation stem or as people branch off from the shot they're like oh hey
[00:18:47.760]  like I don't think I saw you earlier what's your name and then you know things happen.
[00:18:52.160]  Yeah that's a good point. I've literally done that with James before.
[00:18:56.960]  Like if I'm throwing something on my place and then some people don't know James as well
[00:19:00.880]  I'm literally like dude let's take a shot of my friend James and then this is followed up by some
[00:19:07.040]  small talk and then possibly some shit talking. Oh yeah that's another good one like party games
[00:19:14.960]  and stuff. Usually you partner up with your plus one or whatever and then you're like okay let's
[00:19:20.000]  play against these people and then there's some like shit talking, there's some competition either
[00:19:24.960]  way like you get talking and I feel like at the end of the game it's always like oh okay good
[00:19:30.080]  game like we've gained respect for each other so then from there it's also like a stepping point.
[00:19:35.520]  Yeah I feel like all of these just point to like a party setting is sort of the easiest place
[00:19:40.160]  to mix friend groups because I just can't imagine what the easy way would be in like the dinner
[00:19:46.800]  in like a dinner setting for example if you have two friend groups that are mixed
[00:19:50.400]  the only real thing that I could think of is maybe talking about like anecdotes and whatnot but
[00:19:54.640]  that requires way more coordination way more like storytelling and like creativity than just being
[00:20:01.600]  like okay who wants to play rage cake or like who wants to get shot so they're like shortcuts.
[00:20:07.360]  Actually I have had oh my god I had the funniest situation so I was visiting New York once
[00:20:13.520]  and I made plans to catch up with my friend and she's like a singular friend like not really part
[00:20:19.840]  of a friend group the way that we like met and became friends but our core friend group in New York
[00:20:26.080]  I think they caught wind of this they're like oh Crystal what are you doing on Friday or whatever
[00:20:29.680]  I was like oh I'm going to a bar catching up with one of my friends and they're like I wanted to go
[00:20:33.120]  that to that bar too you can say no but like it's okay if we join and then you know what started off
[00:20:39.200]  as like a one-on-one turned into like a whole table of I think it was maybe like seven or eight of us
[00:20:45.360]  oh my god but like my original friend she's not part of that core friend group so in that situation
[00:20:52.960]  I did have to try a bit to like oh you know this is my friend met her in New York blah blah and I
[00:20:58.240]  think because it was a seated situation it worked out okay because I sat right next to her and then
[00:21:03.680]  she could talk to the people sitting across from her and then I could help facilitate some of the
[00:21:08.960]  conversation on the topic of seating I hate it when I'm sitting in a big group and I end up like
[00:21:15.600]  near people I don't know that well oh yeah just like fuck what do I even talk about here and we're
[00:21:20.880]  eating too so I'm gonna have to sit there for like an hour oh my god true I feel like it's so
[00:21:25.520]  important to sit next to the plus one or whoever is like the additional ad not to make them sound
[00:21:32.480]  like unwelcome already big but I feel like it just helps ease their mind so much more because
[00:21:39.840]  it's like okay if all goes terribly I can at least default to talking to this good friend who's
[00:21:45.280]  sitting next to me I think it makes it easier for everyone else in the group too because you know
[00:21:50.320]  the plus one is out on the side than everyone else around them is gonna feel like they're gonna
[00:21:54.560]  feel bad for not talking to them so they'll make an effort but then it's like they don't know them
[00:21:58.560]  like that it is kind of funny sometimes though because I guess depending on the size of the dinner
[00:22:03.440]  sometimes there's multiple conversations going on sometimes there's like one central convo
[00:22:08.720]  and then maybe like a side convo so then when there's one central convo going on and it's
[00:22:13.520]  like the normal banter shit talking funny stories whatnot and then the plus one is having just
[00:22:18.400]  like a really regular like small talk conversation with the person sitting next to them I feel like
[00:22:23.200]  it's hell of funny it's like people shooting the shit and then it's like oh yeah like what school did
[00:22:28.080]  you go to? Aside from like just the one or two friends being mixed into a bigger group do you think
[00:22:35.920]  you have any strategies for like bigger friend mixing as in like maybe two core groups get mixed
[00:22:43.600]  together I think like we were talking about earlier with bigger friend groups too I think parties
[00:22:48.640]  is definitely the easiest to mix them but even without it being a party I think I don't really
[00:22:54.960]  have a strategy per se I kind of just talk to everyone like I went normally and I just try to
[00:23:00.160]  stuff everyone into the same conversation act as a facilitator of the conversation
[00:23:05.440]  and then eventually one or two people will start shit talking me or someone else
[00:23:10.240]  and then it'll just open the flood gates from there I think a big part of mixing bigger friend groups
[00:23:15.360]  for me is just my inherent trust in their personality I'm like listen they're cool they're
[00:23:22.240]  fibers I'm sure they'll vibe with each other we all have similar personalities here there have been
[00:23:27.920]  a few situations though where like certain groups the personality I have with them is different
[00:23:34.240]  than mine with other groups so I tend not to mix those groups in you're like they can't
[00:23:41.040]  they can't know the professional side of me I was gonna bring that up actually because I think
[00:23:47.440]  we've talked pretty positively about mixing friend groups but at least for me personally it can
[00:23:52.800]  sometimes be a source of anxiety I say that as someone who actually enjoys mixing friend groups
[00:23:58.080]  I just find it a little bit hard to like mentally prepare for it and like strategize for it because
[00:24:04.720]  I have a lot of intentionality when I mix friend groups so then sometimes I think grappling
[00:24:10.560]  with the different personalities that I have for like each friend group or you know the different
[00:24:15.040]  memories that you have associated with each friend group are so different I feel like I have to
[00:24:19.840]  like average all of them into one before going into like a mixed friend group paying out such
[00:24:26.560]  yeah I can totally see that even something as simple as like high school versus college
[00:24:32.160]  you're still like the same person but I feel like you go through a lot of change so then sometimes
[00:24:36.720]  there's just some differences you can't help and I think like it's also interesting because it's like
[00:24:42.000]  these people have only seen me in this segment of my life but these other people have seen me
[00:24:46.480]  through like everything maybe or whatever it's kind of like they won't have the context that
[00:24:51.440]  these other friend groups have yeah exactly that's true you guys think you guys have changed a lot
[00:24:56.880]  since high school till now um maybe not that much but I do think in college if there was a graph
[00:25:06.160]  college goes up of it in terms of my personal social activity so I think everyone who has met me before
[00:25:15.920]  and after would be like oh wow like I guess you did a lot in college like you were very social
[00:25:23.040]  I think for me every year of my life has felt so vastly different and I feel like my personality
[00:25:30.640]  and my mood spectrum changes very vividly like every year so then I feel like that also contributes
[00:25:36.400]  to the anxiety a little bit of the mixing friend groups where I'm like this person and I were
[00:25:41.280]  very close back in insert year and back then I felt like a completely different person than now
[00:25:46.240]  so then that's why I think sometimes it's a little bit hard for me to like almost decide
[00:25:51.360]  how I should portray myself or like how I should try to feel that day but it's really more of
[00:25:56.400]  like this exercise that causes the anxiety right like I think the actual mixing of the friend group
[00:26:00.720]  is usually fine it's more of like all the thinking the kind of like mental hoops that I have
[00:26:06.000]  to jump through beforehand that makes it more painful yeah you know that makes sense I think
[00:26:10.960]  something that kind of helps and I've done this in the past is to have an event where people
[00:26:17.440]  can do stuff so I don't think I realized in the moment when I was like planning this but I
[00:26:23.760]  think it was in the back of my mind that it's like oh if I'm gonna host something where like there's
[00:26:28.880]  going to be a lot of people from different areas of my life I hope they have stuff to do so if
[00:26:36.160]  there's any awkward silence they could just be like all right let's just fucking go do that activity
[00:26:41.520]  over there so an example is like my previous couple birthdays I've done like a big karaoke thing in
[00:26:49.360]  New York and then last year I did mini golf and I feel like that just kind of fills the potential
[00:26:55.760]  silence right you're like okay I'm just gonna go play around with any golf now 100% I think the
[00:27:01.600]  activities you did were really good too crystal because they're like big groups can interact but
[00:27:05.920]  it's like if smaller groups want to like they're not as comfortable they can still break off and do
[00:27:09.760]  their own thing yeah I feel like activities are actually really smart because my greatest fear is like
[00:27:15.520]  mixing friend groups is like a choice right like you don't have to mix friend groups so then when
[00:27:20.240]  I'm choosing to mix friend groups I don't want it to be at the expense of something so for example
[00:27:27.520]  if I could have two separate hangouts with two separate friend groups and it's more fun that way
[00:27:32.320]  than I would prefer to do it that way but if I have one hangout and I mix the friend groups and
[00:27:36.560]  it's more fun than I would prefer that right so then sometimes my greatest fear is like okay what if
[00:27:41.360]  I do mix friend groups and this hangout and then at the end of it all it's just not as fun as if
[00:27:47.520]  I did like two separate ones with them you know what I mean dude but I have a counter question yeah
[00:27:53.840]  what if you don't mix the friend groups but then like one of the activities that you do with one
[00:27:59.840]  of the friend groups is more fun than the other one and then people from the other one see
[00:28:05.520]  you know the more fun one and then they're like damn what the fuck like how come we get there
[00:28:12.400]  that's true I guess you would have to make it exactly the same just repeat the same thing
[00:28:19.600]  honestly the more we're talking about the more I'm thinking about it I'm like I don't even know if
[00:28:24.000]  I mix that many big groups I feel like I slowly just introduce more and more people into the group
[00:28:31.600]  so it's just everyone just knows each other by the end well like I'm pretty sure both of you have
[00:28:36.400]  already met most of my other friends yeah honestly that's a good strategy though yeah to be honest
[00:28:44.480]  after because you slowly bring more and more people into this big amorphous group of friends
[00:28:50.160]  it's like some of them end up getting really close like I know some of my friends are forget
[00:28:54.400]  what I was talking to them about but they're like oh yeah the other day I want those two like
[00:28:59.200]  this like warehouse party and I'm like you just didn't even invite me
[00:29:04.880]  do you see that as like a sign of success or are you kind of like down DFTI?
[00:29:08.960]  well I see that as a sign of success because then now I'm like dude I can hang out with all of them
[00:29:14.800]  together and I don't even need a worry like that's great you're like wow I'm the one left out
[00:29:20.480]  of the conversation exactly but I guess in that strategy it's more like smaller friend group
[00:29:27.920]  mixing moments similar to what we were talking about in the beginning where it's like maybe the
[00:29:32.800]  plus one or two and then slowly incorporating in the end it's like all these small efforts have
[00:29:40.640]  succeeded into like the overall big effort yeah I guess I'm trying to think back and at this point
[00:29:48.160]  in our lives especially like post wedding post bachelor party and all of that I feel like all
[00:29:53.120]  of our friends are pretty cool with each other like close to each other have inside jokes and
[00:29:56.880]  whatnot but trying to recall like back in the day when we first started mixing James' high school
[00:30:02.240]  friend group who's like one of our core friend groups essentially and our college friend group
[00:30:07.280]  and I remember it felt like such a big deal back then and everyone that kind of known each other
[00:30:12.720]  through like rames or like events that we had gone through in college but it still felt like
[00:30:18.720]  okay we're intentionally mixing friend groups and I definitely remember some more awkward moments
[00:30:25.120]  and moments where maybe things didn't go as smoothly especially when I don't know like how would
[00:30:32.080]  you describe it Crystal I mean you guys were both there for these right it's like sometimes
[00:30:35.760]  I feel like those are so awkward I think like especially when people just defaulted to their normal
[00:30:41.520]  oh yeah group I was guilty of that I was I could have made it I was guilty of that
[00:30:48.000]  I truly didn't talk to like James' like high school group until
[00:30:52.560]  she got probably like the bachelor party it's like when I really talked to them but before that
[00:30:58.000]  it's like I would talk to them but it's like unless there's an activity we were all doing together
[00:31:03.200]  it was much more comfortable to just like default to the people you know better yeah maybe
[00:31:09.360]  because it was like such established groups and then it was like almost forced in a way guys
[00:31:15.680]  let's all hang out together so then it was just like oh okay well I feel more comfortable talking
[00:31:21.520]  with this group so but what's so interesting is that like James and I are in the same high school
[00:31:27.360]  friend group so like James and I know both of the friend groups and then G-Zooh is also you know
[00:31:33.520]  like G-Zooh hangs out with the high school friend group a lot and then also you know we have the
[00:31:37.680]  college friend group so like us three were kind of in the middle and then we're just like oh god
[00:31:42.640]  who do we talk to like what should we do I definitely think there was like a evolution of
[00:31:49.040]  the two groups smashing and I feel like in the beginning it was exactly right it's like
[00:31:53.840]  kind of awkward segregation like some piecemeal conversations here and there but for the most part
[00:31:59.040]  it's like two friend groups coexisting and I hang out essentially but there was a couple of things
[00:32:04.320]  that I felt like really helped break through the ice so one was there was an era in our lives
[00:32:09.840]  I think like immediately after graduating college where a couple of us were like always foaming
[00:32:14.960]  at the mouth to like go out every weekend instead of being like oh guys like this friend group
[00:32:21.440]  should hang out and like we should mix friend groups it was like we need to go out this Friday
[00:32:25.600]  who's available who's down who's down so then we would just spam text everyone yeah but I think once
[00:32:31.040]  we got those like smaller groups going and there was a mission to be accomplished I felt like it
[00:32:35.920]  made things a lot more natural and then some sort of like relationships eventually developed
[00:32:40.720]  and the other thing that I felt like really helped was anytime there was something to like celebrate
[00:32:46.160]  so when we threw our like joint house forming or had like birthday parties and stuff I felt like
[00:32:51.920]  they were significantly less awkward during those birthday parties if anyone had any sort of like
[00:32:57.600]  gossip or tea I that really fucking brought the group together yes oh my god I totally agree
[00:33:04.240]  I feel like having some sort of common theme or goal so exactly how you described it would bring
[00:33:11.920]  things together because people would be like oh we're here to like celebrate this person or
[00:33:16.400]  you know we're here to have fun because we all wanted to go out versus like oh we're just kind of
[00:33:21.760]  hanging out yeah it actually kind of reminds me of recently my friend threw a gallon times and the
[00:33:28.480]  gallon times was actually like purely mixed friend groups I think there was maybe no more than like two
[00:33:34.240]  or three people from like each friend group essentially and most people were kind of like one-off
[00:33:38.560]  friends so then it's kind of like a room full of acquaintances last strangers right and then what
[00:33:44.240]  I thought was really smart was one obviously there's theme because it's gallon times everyone was
[00:33:48.720]  dressed cute and there's like some sort of fun thing to celebrate but I also noticed that my friend
[00:33:53.600]  was intentionally giving everyone a job or would like pair people to a job so she's like okay you
[00:33:58.560]  too come here and build this Shakur to report or like can you guys help me set this table up and by
[00:34:04.320]  doing that I felt like there's a specific mission and like an activity and you're like paired up with
[00:34:09.920]  people but it's not forced to be like oh meet my friend and become festies right away yeah so then
[00:34:14.720]  I felt like that also made it a lot more natural yeah kind of like the going out everyone's
[00:34:18.800]  working towards something together I feel like a big part of the success of mixing friend groups is
[00:34:25.840]  all these activities just work towards allowing people to be comfortable with showing who they
[00:34:31.200]  really are to people they're not as familiar with and I think once that's really shown is when people
[00:34:38.480]  really start getting along with each other and being really comfortable with each other it falls in
[00:34:42.960]  line with what I'm sensing is kind of a theme here that it's like people will unite under like a
[00:34:49.200]  similar thing whether that be like a goal a person an event whatever you know how we said a wedding
[00:34:57.600]  is like kind of the ultimate friend mixer but that's like you know such a common theme I guess it's
[00:35:03.840]  like over here to celebrate this couple's love so everyone's like oh my god I'm so happy to be here
[00:35:10.480]  and I expect to meet new people as well so it usually always works out and I guess like
[00:35:17.360]  it's easier to find that common ground to like start a conversation on as well because you know
[00:35:24.480]  like the biggest question or the easiest question to ask at a wedding is like oh do you know the
[00:35:29.280]  group like are you from the groom side or the bride side and then from there like everything goes on
[00:35:34.880]  I feel like my takeaway from this entire conversation is that we need a rebrand every hangout
[00:35:40.000]  as a celebration of something something everyone every time we hang out there's like some sort of
[00:35:45.120]  thing we're trying to celebrate and that's our main goal yeah because I feel like even if it were
[00:35:49.360]  something simple like oh my god let's get together and like binge this tv show I think everyone who
[00:35:55.760]  goes has that common interest already like oh my god I'm so excited to see like what's gonna
[00:35:59.920]  happen next even if they don't know each other the bond over like oh my god I hate this character
[00:36:04.480]  or like oh my god I'm rooting for this character this is a slight pivot but I was thinking about
[00:36:08.960]  this earlier have you guys ever been in situations where you have like maybe a singular friend
[00:36:13.920]  or like a small group of friends that you just don't really want to introduce to your larger group
[00:36:20.240]  but that you be nervous about I don't know how to word this I guess like friend groups that
[00:36:23.840]  you're trying not to mix right yeah I guess yeah I guess so yeah I can definitely relate to that
[00:36:30.000]  I feel like it's natural like sometimes you have fun groups that
[00:36:34.240]  mix more or like mesh better and then sometimes there's fun groups that you want to maybe keep
[00:36:39.120]  more private or like you prefer them to be kind of like exclusive to you and that friend group only
[00:36:45.680]  and I feel like that's natural but the only difficult thing for me is I don't know how to articulate
[00:36:51.120]  that and sometimes it's something that I kind of wonder like am I a shitty friend or am I a
[00:36:55.680]  shitty person for not wanting to mix this friend group with other friends for example nah I don't
[00:37:00.320]  think you're shitty but it's like I don't know it's something that I grapple with to the point
[00:37:06.960]  where I've like brought it up to my therapist before and I was like is it wrong that I mix friend
[00:37:12.160]  group a bc but not friend group d and she was like why would that be wrong you're just setting up
[00:37:19.600]  each friend group for success in the way that you understand that friend group so you don't have
[00:37:24.560]  to feel guilty about it that's just how you feel and she was like also there's no obligation to
[00:37:28.640]  mix friend groups and I was like whoa you're like wait what yeah oh my the immediate thought I had
[00:37:37.680]  when this question was posed I think it's very reasonable especially if like maybe a friend group
[00:37:42.960]  is very niche for example say you and this friend group are really into like pottery or something
[00:37:50.000]  and then like literally no one else cares about pottery in like your other friend group you know
[00:37:56.080]  or maybe like they're not into it the way that like you and that other friend group is so they just
[00:38:01.440]  like wouldn't mix because it's like oh well when I hang out with this group all we do is like
[00:38:06.320]  make pottery and talk about pottery but then when I hang out with this other group like all we do
[00:38:10.960]  is like drink and gossip you know like it just wouldn't work so I feel like there's definitely
[00:38:15.600]  no fault in that I never really thought about it like that also pottery sounds hell of fun
[00:38:22.320]  have you guys done it before no I actually haven't so hard is it we should give a try sometime
[00:38:31.040]  I think also age gaps another thing I'm thinking of is like work friends maybe like sometimes
[00:38:37.120]  it might be hard to mix work friends with your childhood friends just because it's like you
[00:38:42.640]  would be showing them like a degenerate side of you when you're like okay they need to keep the
[00:38:46.960]  like professional adult me in their mind I think as much as I'd like to think that I interact with
[00:38:53.760]  my work friends like how I interact with my other friends there's definitely like a level of
[00:38:58.480]  reservation yeah and like I'm holding myself back in a sense of like I'm not really gonna show
[00:39:05.040]  them like all the sides of me because at the end of the day work is work yeah I think it's a very
[00:39:10.240]  interesting concept to think about and it's something that I thought about a lot last year actually
[00:39:14.480]  with like the vacherate party and whatnot and the wedding and making tables and all of this like
[00:39:19.440]  thought that goes behind like curating exactly who socializes with who and whatnot I think for
[00:39:25.440]  thought that helped me the most was I have a lot of friends that I love but I don't want to meet
[00:39:31.120]  all of their friends and I don't want to always be hanging out with them plus all of their friends
[00:39:35.600]  so then it made me kind of put down that guilt of like oh am I not mixing this friend or like
[00:39:41.680]  this friend group enough into my life because there's nothing wrong with like keeping people separate
[00:39:47.280]  like your therapist said you just you know you're just setting all the friend groups up for success
[00:39:51.920]  yeah well I have a final question for all of us do you think among all of this there's like
[00:39:59.520]  maybe like etiquette rules or like things to keep in mind overall
[00:40:04.560]  I think one big thing I don't know if this is like etiquette or a rule but more of something to keep
[00:40:11.360]  in mind it's like when you're mixing friend groups you also want to consider how your friends would
[00:40:16.400]  feel in that environment because as exciting as it is for you because you know everyone there
[00:40:20.560]  everyone has a different personality some people are more extroverted some people are more
[00:40:24.000]  introverted even if you think everyone's gonna get along just fine it's like some people when
[00:40:29.200]  they're put in situations where there's like a lot of people they don't know if they get like
[00:40:33.360]  way more anxious and they just won't end up having a good time so you always have to think about
[00:40:38.720]  how that person is socially as like a baseline not how they interact with you but how they are
[00:40:43.440]  generally it's a good one yeah I think my final etiquette thought is probably similar to that it's
[00:40:49.120]  like know the vibe of the event don't overexert people's social abilities essentially
[00:40:56.560]  so I feel like some things are sacred like reunions maybe don't mix friend groups there
[00:41:01.840]  you're just like really truly setting up your plus one for like a shitty night basically
[00:41:06.880]  birthday parties maybe don't bring plus ones or like mixed friend groups there if you're the guest
[00:41:12.800]  and if you are part of the friend group being mixed then just try to come with the vibe try to be
[00:41:18.160]  open-minded and maybe you'll meet a friend who you like better than the friend who introduced you
[00:41:23.360]  take care okay yeah I think you two summed it up really well thank you Jonathan for joining us this
