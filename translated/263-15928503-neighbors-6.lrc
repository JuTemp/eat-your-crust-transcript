[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:15.450] Alright, so before we go into our topic today, I want to introduce a new Gen Z word.
[00:00:15.450] 好的，在我们进入今天的主题之前，我想介绍一个Z世代的新词。
[00:00:20.930] I feel like I'm kind of taking over this segment for the day as a substitute.
[00:00:20.930] 我觉得我今天算是代替其他人主持这个环节。
[00:00:26.450] But this word is crashing out. And I feel like I've started to see trickles of this
[00:00:26.450] 但这个词正在消亡。我觉得我已经开始看到一些零星的迹象了。
[00:00:31.970] maybe like six months ago or so. And then recently I see it used a little bit more commonly as well.
[00:00:31.970] 大概六个月前吧。然后最近我发现它使用得更频繁了。
[00:00:38.030] But essentially what this word means to me is like, I'm fucked up or this got me fucked up.
[00:00:38.030] 但对我来说，这个词的本质含义是：我完蛋了，或者这件事让我完蛋了。
[00:00:45.890] So an example in meme format is me genuinely crashing out on the first day of school
[00:00:45.890] 举个例子，用表情包的形式来说，就是我开学第一天就彻底睡着了。
[00:00:51.710] if I'm required to do an icebreaker for more than one class.
[00:00:51.710] 如果我需要为不止一个班级做破冰活动。
[00:00:55.150] That's a good one. I feel like that's very relatable.
[00:00:55.150] 这个说得好。我觉得很有共鸣。
[00:00:58.350] It is.
[00:00:58.350] 这是。
[00:00:58.990] It's very tiring to do icebreakers all day.
[00:00:58.990] 整天做破冰活动非常累人。
[00:01:01.470] Yeah, and I feel like I see this the most when some sort of news breaks out about like a celebrity
[00:01:01.470] 是的，我觉得这种情况在名人爆出新闻的时候最常见。
[00:01:09.410] or something like that. Or say there's a TikTok where it describes a scenario where you would be
[00:01:09.410] 或者类似的事情。或者说，有个TikTok视频描述了一种你会……的场景。
[00:01:15.630] sad or upset. The comments will be like, yeah, this got me crashing out. It's pretty reminiscent of
[00:01:15.630] 感到难过或沮丧。评论会是这样的：是啊，这让我崩溃了。这很像……
[00:01:21.730] like other slang that describes getting into a certain feeling about something like feeling upset.
[00:01:21.730] 就像其他俚语一样，用来描述对某事产生某种感觉，比如感到沮丧。
[00:01:28.850] Yeah, I actually haven't really seen this one around. But to be honest, I have been not really
[00:01:28.850] 是啊，我其实没怎么见过这个。不过说实话，我之前也没怎么关注过。
[00:01:35.490] scrolling TikTok lately. So I haven't been up to date on the trends for a while. But I think that
[00:01:35.490] 最近一直在刷TikTok，所以好久没关注潮流趋势了。但我认为
[00:01:42.550] makes sense. I guess like the first image that comes to my mind for crashing out is crashing a car.
[00:01:42.550] 有道理。我想，我脑海里第一个想到的“崩溃”画面就是车祸。
[00:01:50.410] Either that or I think it's still very common to say like caffeine crashes or something.
[00:01:50.410] 要么就是，我觉得现在仍然很流行说“咖啡因崩溃”之类的话。
[00:01:55.110] So then I guess in my mind, I'm just thinking like it's kind of similar. You know, you're hella tired
[00:01:55.110] 所以我觉得，在我的脑海里，情况其实差不多。你知道，你累得要死。
[00:02:01.210] after a caffeine or sugar rush, and then you crash and you take a nap. So crashing out is kind of like
[00:02:01.210] 摄入咖啡因或糖分后，你会感到一阵兴奋，然后就会崩溃，需要小睡一会儿。所以，这种“崩溃”的感觉有点像……
[00:02:07.390] related to that in a way.
[00:02:07.390] 某种程度上与此相关。
[00:02:10.190] Actually, I feel like that kind of tracks with maybe the more original definition of crash out. So if you
[00:02:10.190] 实际上，我觉得那种类型的曲目或许更符合“崩溃”一词最初的定义。所以如果你
[00:02:16.950] Google crashing out, one of the definitions is what I just described. So someone feeling upset.
[00:02:16.950] 谷歌崩溃了，其中一个解释就是我刚才描述的情况。所以有人会感到沮丧。
[00:02:22.250] But another definition could be someone who loses control and freaks out, whether that means
[00:02:22.250] 但另一种定义可能是指失去控制、情绪失控的人，无论这意味着什么
[00:02:29.730] they're unpredictable and outbursting, or it could also mean someone who indulges in bad behavior.
[00:02:29.730] 他们喜怒无常、情绪爆发，或者也可能指行为不端的人。
[00:02:38.830] Yeah.
[00:02:38.830] 是的。
[00:02:39.110] So I feel like the definition is really broad.
[00:02:39.110] 所以我感觉这个定义非常宽泛。
[00:02:42.290] It is a little broad.
[00:02:42.290] 它有点宽。
[00:02:43.350] Yeah, it like changes depending on what context you use it.
[00:02:43.350] 是的，它的含义会根据你使用的语境而改变。
[00:02:47.550] Okay, I think that makes more sense because I'm looking at some examples. And this one says,
[00:02:47.550] 好的，我觉得这样解释更清楚了，因为我正在看一些例子。这个例子是这么说的：
[00:02:53.690] when a boy talks to us crazy, but we remember we have crash out BFs. My interpretation of this
[00:02:53.690] 当一个男生跟我们胡言乱语时，我们却想起自己还有几个炮友。我对这句话的理解是这样的。
[00:03:00.990] is that the girls who are getting talked to by the boy are like, Oh, yeah, I have my best friend who I
[00:03:00.990] 是不是那些被男生搭讪的女生会想：“哦，是啊，我也有我最好的朋友……”
[00:03:08.010] can crash out with like act crazy with to like freak out about this dude talking to them crazy with.
[00:03:08.010] 可能会崩溃，表现得像疯了一样，比如对这个疯子跟他们说话感到抓狂。
[00:03:14.570] Yeah, that that makes sense. Maybe I don't know. It's a little vague. Hopefully I'm interpreting
[00:03:14.570] 嗯，这样说得通。也许我理解错了。这有点含糊不清。希望我的理解没错。
[00:03:22.150] this correctly. All I know is crash out basically means crazy. Crazy, unpredictable or bad. I think
[00:03:22.150] 没错。我只知道崩溃基本上就意味着糟糕透顶。糟糕透顶、难以预测或者很糟。我想
[00:03:32.250] it's the conclusion of this word. Okay. Another one that kind of makes sense is this video. It says
[00:03:32.250] 这是这个词的结尾。好的。另一个有点道理的例子是这个视频。它说：
[00:03:39.610] POV bro didn't answer the call. So no one could talk you out of crashing out. So like no one could
[00:03:39.610] POV兄弟没接电话。所以没人能劝你别出去睡觉。所以就像没人能……
[00:03:45.990] talk him out of acting up or like being crazy. Yeah, makes sense. This one says me crashing out when
[00:03:45.990] 劝他别胡闹或者像疯了一样。嗯，有道理。这句话让我崩溃大哭。
[00:03:54.510] I text first and get left on delivered for 0.5 seconds. That's a good one. So I think we have
[00:03:54.510] 我先发短信，结果显示已送达0.5秒。这挺有意思的。所以我觉得我们已经……
[00:04:03.470] gotten to the gist of the term. Okay, I'll keep my eye out for this one. I feel like I haven't really
[00:04:03.470] 我已经掌握了这个术语的要点。好的，我会留意这个术语。我觉得我还没有真正……
[00:04:10.430] seen it. But yeah, as I said, I haven't really been scrolling as much lately. This one I just thought
[00:04:10.430] 看到了。不过，就像我说的，我最近确实没怎么刷手机。这个我只是觉得……
[00:04:16.350] was relevant because I've been hearing it more in like podcasts. Oh, yeah. What so like we crash out
[00:04:16.350] 之所以觉得相关，是因为我最近在播客里经常听到这个说法。哦，对。所以我们就崩溃了。
[00:04:22.250] in the podcast? Like someone would talk about kind of a kid to our crises episodes. Yeah,
[00:04:22.250] 在播客里？就像有人会谈到我们危机事件那几期节目里的小孩子一样。是的。
[00:04:28.370] someone would be like, dude, I've been crashing out lately. Like I've been super fucked up,
[00:04:28.370] 有人会说：“兄弟，我最近老是昏睡过去。我简直糟透了。”
[00:04:33.230] emotional, you know, not doing so hot. Oh my god. Yeah, I guess our crises episodes are
[00:04:33.230] 情绪方面，你知道，不太好。我的天哪。是啊，我想我们的危机事件就是
[00:04:39.290] like us just crashing out. Exactly. Wow, I feel connected to this word now.
[00:04:39.290] 就像我们突然崩溃一样。没错。哇，我现在感觉和这个词有了某种联系。
[00:04:48.870] Well, today our topic actually has nothing to do with the word. But our episode today is going to be
[00:04:48.870] 嗯，今天我们的话题其实和这个词无关。但我们今天的节目内容是……
[00:04:56.890] about neighbors. And I feel like this is kind of an interesting topic because having neighbors is
[00:04:56.890] 关于邻居。我觉得这是一个很有趣的话题，因为拥有邻居……
[00:05:03.370] unavoidable to an extent. But the level of interaction you have with them is very contextual based on where
[00:05:03.370] 在某种程度上是不可避免的。但你与他们的互动程度很大程度上取决于具体情况。
[00:05:10.670] you live, what kind of neighborhood you live in, and also what kind of personality you have. So let's
[00:05:10.670] 你住在哪里，住在什么样的社区，以及你的性格如何，这些都会影响你的决定。所以，我们来谈谈……
[00:05:15.930] start this with a very simple question, which is, do you say hi to your neighbors? Oh my god, I
[00:05:15.930] 先问一个很简单的问题：你会跟邻居打招呼吗？我的天哪，我
[00:05:22.470] I have a problem. I do not. Although actually, when we were first creating this topic, I had zero
[00:05:22.470] 我有问题吗？我没有。虽然实际上，当我们最初创建这个话题时，我完全没有问题。
[00:05:34.930] interaction with my relatively new neighbors. But since then, it's been a couple weeks. So I actually
[00:05:34.930] 我和新邻居们有了些互动。但从那以后，已经过去几个星期了。所以实际上
[00:05:42.130] have interacted with them like once. Once. Yeah. So actually, when I moved in, I had a different
[00:05:42.130] 我跟他们接触过一次，就一次。是的。所以实际上，当我搬进来的时候，我的情况和现在完全不同。
[00:05:52.050] neighbor, but they moved out shortly after I moved in because I guess their lease was up
[00:05:52.050] 我以前是邻居，但他们在我搬进来后不久就搬走了，我猜是因为他们的租约到期了。
[00:05:56.730] and they wanted to find a bigger place. But that neighbor was really nice because I was moving in
[00:05:56.730] 他们想找个更大的房子。不过，因为我要搬进去，那位邻居人真的很好。
[00:06:02.430] and they actually reached out. They like came by and said hi. And they're like, hey, let me know if
[00:06:02.430] 他们居然主动联系了我。他们过来打了个招呼，还说：“嘿，如果有什么事，请告诉我。”
[00:06:07.030] you need anything. I was like, oh my god, they're so kind. And we actually share a garage. I was like
[00:06:07.030] 你需要什么吗？我当时就想，我的天哪，他们太好了。而且我们居然共用一个车库。我当时就想
[00:06:13.630] trying to park my car in the garage. But you know, these people are probably used to having the whole
[00:06:13.630] 我正试图把车停进车库。但你知道，这些人可能已经习惯了整个车库。
[00:06:18.750] garage to themselves for a while before I moved in. So they were really nice because they noticed
[00:06:18.750] 在我搬进去之前，车库他们独占了一段时间。所以他们人真的很好，因为他们注意到了这一点。
[00:06:24.330] that I tried to park the next day I came back. And they were reparking their car in the garage.
[00:06:24.330] 第二天我回来的时候，我试着停车，结果发现他们正在把车重新停进车库。
[00:06:30.230] And they were like, oh, I saw you're trying to park. So we're just gonna, you know, make sure you
[00:06:30.230] 他们说：“哦，我看到你在停车了。所以我们只是想确保……”
[00:06:35.010] have like enough room. I know is a little cramped in there. I was like, oh my god, thank you so much.
[00:06:35.010] 空间还算够用。我知道里面有点挤。我当时就想，我的天哪，太感谢你了。
[00:06:39.390] Like I didn't have to do any of the reaching out, you know. That is very nice. It's nice when they come
[00:06:39.390] 好像我根本不用主动联系他们，你知道吗？这真的很好。他们主动联系我真是太好了。
[00:06:45.370] as like a full package themselves. They do the introducing, they do the interactions with you,
[00:06:45.370] 他们就像一个完整的服务团队，既负责介绍，也负责与你互动。
[00:06:50.330] and you just have to receive it. Yeah. But once my new neighbors moved in, I literally, oh my god,
[00:06:50.330] 你只能接受。是啊。但是自从我的新邻居搬进来之后，我简直……我的天哪……
[00:06:58.910] this is kind of embarrassing. I think it was like the first week that the guy was kind of slowly
[00:06:58.910] 这有点尴尬。我觉得大概是第一周的时候，那家伙有点……
[00:07:04.770] moving in. I like would sometimes just see him walk by on my doorbell, like the camera. And I would
[00:07:04.770] 搬进来的时候，我有时会通过门铃摄像头看到他走过。然后我会
[00:07:12.410] think every time, because you get a notification too, right? So I just like watch this dude walk
[00:07:12.410] 每次都要想一想，因为你也会收到通知，对吧？所以我就看着这哥们儿走路。
[00:07:16.410] across my door. And I would think every time like, oh, should I like say hi? And this went on for months.
[00:07:16.410] 它就在我的门前。每次看到它，我都会想，哦，我应该打个招呼吗？这种情况持续了好几个月。
[00:07:26.350] Without saying hi. Yeah, I never said hi. Okay, to be fair, interactions are a two-way door.
[00:07:26.350] 连招呼都没打。是啊，我都没打招呼。好吧，公平地说，人际交往是双向的。
[00:07:33.990] So just as you didn't say hi, like he also didn't make the first move to say hi to you.
[00:07:33.990] 就像你没有主动打招呼一样，他也没有主动向你打招呼。
[00:07:39.530] That's very true. Very, very good point.
[00:07:39.530] 确实如此。说得非常对。
[00:07:45.030] I remember texting our girls group chat too. Also, when this person was first moving in,
[00:07:45.030] 我还记得当时也在我们女生群里发信息。还有，这个人刚搬进来的时候，
[00:07:51.310] I had only seen their car the first couple of days. So I didn't even know if it was like a guy or a
[00:07:51.310] 头几天我只见过他们的车。所以我甚至不知道车主是男的还是女的。
[00:07:57.210] girl. So I saw their car and I was like, oh my god, I texted our girls group chat. And I was like,
[00:07:57.210] 女孩。我看到她们的车，当时我就想，我的天哪，我赶紧在我们的女生群里发了消息。然后我说，
[00:08:02.890] do you think I could look up this person's name by searching their license plate?
[00:08:02.890] 你觉得我可以通过搜索车牌号来查到这个人的名字吗？
[00:08:09.280] And then our friend Sarah was like, dude, Crystal, why don't you just introduce yourself?
[00:08:09.280] 然后我们的朋友莎拉就说：“克里斯托，你为什么不自我介绍一下呢？”
[00:08:15.480] And then you could find out their name. And I was like, oh my god, you're right. I need to put my
[00:08:15.480] 然后你就能知道他们的名字了。我当时就想，我的天哪，你说得对。我得把我的名字写下来。
[00:08:20.960] phone down and stop crashing out. Oh, it is relevant.
[00:08:20.960] 手机放下，别再死机了。哦，这很重要。
[00:08:27.620] Honestly, though, I feel like I can kind of understand where you're coming from, because
[00:08:27.620] 说实话，我觉得我有点能理解你的想法，因为
[00:08:31.580] this isn't necessarily always the case. But if you and your neighbor are opposite gender,
[00:08:31.580] 情况并非总是如此。但如果你和你的邻居是异性，
[00:08:38.240] and you yourself are like a girl, I feel like it adds like an extra layer of nervousness a little
[00:08:38.240] 而且你自己就像个女孩子，我觉得这会让你多一份紧张感。
[00:08:44.280] bit to where I might feel a little bit more safe doing a little bit of research before I actually go
[00:08:44.280] 这让我觉得，在真正出发前做一些调查研究会更安心一些。
[00:08:50.720] and talk to this person face to face. Whereas if your neighbor was a couple or a girl,
[00:08:50.720] 并与这个人面对面交谈。而如果你的邻居是一对夫妇或一个女孩，
[00:08:56.660] then it might feel a little bit more easier and intuitive.
[00:08:56.660] 这样一来，操作起来可能会感觉更容易、更直观一些。
[00:08:59.980] For sure. So soon I found out that my neighbor is a guy because I saw him walk across my doorbell
[00:08:59.980] 当然。我很快就发现我的邻居是个男的，因为我看到他从我家门前走过。
[00:09:06.260] later. But actually, I think it's like a couple now. Like it was just the guy for a month or two.
[00:09:06.260] 后来。但实际上，我觉得他们现在就像一对情侣。就像之前一两个月只有他一个人。
[00:09:14.800] And then now like his girlfriend is there all the time. I don't know if she's just like living with
[00:09:14.800] 现在他女朋友好像一直都在。我不知道她是不是就住在他家。
[00:09:19.520] him or if she just is more often than not staying over at his place all the time. Because you know,
[00:09:19.520] 或者说，她经常待在他家过夜。因为你知道，
[00:09:24.480] sometimes when it's like, you're basically living there, but you're not on the lease.
[00:09:24.480] 有时候情况就是这样，你基本上住在那里，但你没有签租约。
[00:09:28.820] Right, right. Maybe that is why you were able to say hi to your neighbors.
[00:09:28.820] 对，对。也许这就是你能够和邻居打招呼的原因吧。
[00:09:33.460] Wait, honestly, it was because my it's still only been one interaction, I think. And that was one time
[00:09:33.460] 等等，说实话，我觉得是因为我们之间只有一次互动。而且那也只是一次而已。
[00:09:41.280] I was like leaving to I think I was going to go grocery shopping. And I backed out of the garage.
[00:09:41.280] 我当时正准备出门，我想我是要去超市买东西。然后我倒车出了车库。
[00:09:47.220] And then the girlfriend came and she had parked her car on the driveway. I rolled down my window
[00:09:47.220] 然后女朋友来了，她把车停在了车道上。我摇下了车窗。
[00:09:52.620] and I was like, do you want me to like leave the garage door open? Because I know she usually parks
[00:09:52.620] 我当时就问她，要不要我把车库门开着？因为我知道她通常会把车停在那里。
[00:09:57.280] her car in the garage. And she was like, yeah, yeah, I got it. And I was like, okay, cool.
[00:09:57.280] 她的车停在车库里。她就说，是啊，是啊，我明白了。我说，好的，酷。
[00:10:01.920] And that was like our first ever interaction. It wasn't even with the guy who I'm pretty sure is
[00:10:01.920] 那就像是我们第一次接触。甚至都不是和那个我几乎可以肯定是……的人。
[00:10:06.300] the main person on the lease. Your heart was probably pounding when you rolled down the window.
[00:10:06.300] 租约上的主要承租人。你摇下车窗时，心跳可能非常快。
[00:10:11.820] Like, holy fuck. Yeah, I debated for like a quick two or three seconds. I was like, oh my god,
[00:10:11.820] 我的天啊。是啊，我犹豫了大概两三秒钟。我当时就想，我的老天爷啊。
[00:10:16.580] like, should I roll down the window? Or should I just assume to like leave the garage door open?
[00:10:16.580] 比如说，我应该摇下车窗吗？还是应该就让车库门开着？
[00:10:21.260] I don't know what to do. And I was like, okay, I'll just I'll just roll down my window.
[00:10:21.260] 我不知道该怎么办。然后我就想，好吧，那我就把车窗摇下来吧。
[00:10:27.000] Dude, honestly, like neighbor interactions are sometimes a little bit awkward,
[00:10:27.000] 老兄，说真的，邻里互动有时候确实有点尴尬。
[00:10:31.180] especially when one of the neighbors is in the car. I feel like there's a little bit of like,
[00:10:31.180] 尤其是当邻居在车里的时候。我觉得有点……
[00:10:36.280] oh, do I wave and say something in like sign language? Or will they roll down their window?
[00:10:36.280] 哦，我是该挥手用手语说点什么呢？还是他们会摇下车窗？
[00:10:42.340] Or should I roll down the window? So I've definitely been there.
[00:10:42.340] 或者我应该摇下车窗？我肯定去过那里。
[00:10:45.740] True. Oh my god, I actually just remembered I did have another interaction. And it was when you were
[00:10:45.740] 没错。我的天哪，我刚刚才想起来，我们之前还有过一次互动。当时你……
[00:10:51.700] here. We were recording an episode. True. And then the neighbor, the girl, she knocked on the door and
[00:10:51.700] 就在这儿。我们当时正在录节目。没错。然后邻居，那个女孩，她敲了敲门，
[00:10:58.080] was like, oh, one of your packages got delivered to our place by accident. And I was like, oh my god,
[00:10:58.080] 当时的情况是，哦，你们的一个包裹不小心送到我们家了。我当时就想，我的天哪！
[00:11:02.340] thank you.
[00:11:02.340] 谢谢。
[00:11:04.160] You know, that actually reminds me of another interaction that one of us had with your neighbors.
[00:11:04.160] 你知道吗，这让我想起了我们其中一人与你邻居的另一次互动。
[00:11:10.620] Oh my god.
[00:11:10.620] 我的天啊。
[00:11:11.240] And it was one time where you were kind of out of town for a little bit. And your package got
[00:11:11.240] 有一次你暂时出差在外，你的包裹……
[00:11:15.860] delivered to your porch. I think it might have been like a temperature sensitive package or
[00:11:15.860] 已送至您家门口。我想这可能是个对温度敏感的包裹。
[00:11:20.360] something. Yeah. So you had asked me and James to pick it up and hold it for a little bit. And James
[00:11:20.360] 一些事。是的。所以你让我和詹姆斯把它拿起来，帮你拿一会儿。还有詹姆斯
[00:11:26.540] went to your place and picked up your package off the porch. And he said that the neighbors you have
[00:11:26.540] 他去了你家，从门廊上取走了你的包裹。他说你的邻居……
[00:11:31.380] across the street were like doing some sort of like barbecue in their front yard or something. And
[00:11:31.380] 街对面的人好像在自家前院搞烧烤之类的活动。
[00:11:36.160] they were just staring at him. Like, who is this guy who just drives up, parks the car, gets your
[00:11:36.160] 他们就那么盯着他看。好像在想，这人是谁啊，开车过来，停好车，然后……
[00:11:43.520] package and immediately leaves? Oh my god, that's so funny. I didn't realize they were out barbecuing.
[00:11:43.520] 打包完就走了？我的天哪，太搞笑了。我不知道他们出去烧烤了。
[00:11:50.540] When James said that to me, he was like, neighbors gave me a weird look. I just like laughed. I was like,
[00:11:50.540] 詹姆斯跟我说这话的时候，邻居们都用奇怪的眼神看着我。我当时就笑了。我当时就想，
[00:11:55.160] lol, haha, it's fine. I'm pretty sure they like stopped talking and just like stared at
[00:11:55.160] 哈哈，没事儿。我敢肯定他们当时停止了交谈，只是盯着我看。
[00:12:01.220] him as he got out of his car. It's so funny. Oh my god. Wait, actually, those neighbors across the
[00:12:01.220] 他下车的时候。太搞笑了。我的天哪。等等，其实，对面那些邻居……
[00:12:09.120] street, if they're the ones that I'm thinking about, if they were barbecuing, they might have
[00:12:09.120] 街上，如果我没记错的话，如果他们在烧烤，他们可能会……
[00:12:14.860] been like diagonally across. But the neighbors that are like directly across the street are pretty
[00:12:14.860] 就像斜对面那样。但街对面的邻居们都很不错。
[00:12:19.460] nice, I think. Because one time I was like packing my car with my golf clubs. And then he was like,
[00:12:19.460] 我觉得挺好的。因为有一次我正往车里装高尔夫球杆，然后他就说，
[00:12:25.520] oh, like you golf? They also happened to be outside. And I was like, yeah, yeah, getting ready
[00:12:25.520] 哦，你喜欢打高尔夫吗？他们当时正好也在外面。我就说，是啊是啊，正在准备呢。
[00:12:30.500] to go golf that like Sunnyvale Muni or something. The dude was like, hey, that's awesome. Like we
[00:12:30.500] 去打高尔夫，比如去桑尼维尔市政球场之类的。那家伙说，嘿，太棒了。就像我们
[00:12:36.380] just came back from golfing or something. And I was like, whoa, cool. Well, I mean, you know,
[00:12:36.380] 我刚打完高尔夫回来，然后就觉得，哇，真酷。嗯，我的意思是，你知道，
[00:12:43.300] I was nicer than that. But like, it felt like a very nice interaction.
[00:12:43.300] 我当时的态度比那好得多。不过，感觉那次交流真的很愉快。
[00:12:48.340] That is really nice. Yeah. I think it's surprisingly wholesome when you have positive interactions
[00:12:48.340] 那真好。是啊。我觉得积极的互动让人感觉很温暖，出乎意料地好。
[00:12:53.420] with neighbors. And I do also think it's easier in a more residential area. Because now that I live
[00:12:53.420] 和邻居们相处。而且我也觉得在住宅区更容易一些。因为我现在就住在
[00:13:01.020] in like a single family home, I do have a bit more interaction with neighbors. And even when we pull
[00:13:01.020] 在独栋住宅里，我的确会和邻居有更多的互动。即使我们拉扯
[00:13:06.320] into like our street, for example, if I see another car, well, I don't do this. But James will usually
[00:13:06.320] 例如，如果我在像我们这条街上看到另一辆车，嗯，我不会这么做。但詹姆斯通常会
[00:13:12.560] wave at them or like put his hand up, even if it's just a random car. Versus when we lived in
[00:13:12.560] 他会朝他们挥手或者举起手，即使那只是一辆陌生的车。这跟我们以前住在……的时候截然不同。
[00:13:18.860] apartment complexes for a couple years, I felt like I can't even remember any interaction that
[00:13:18.860] 在公寓楼住了几年后，我感觉自己甚至记不起任何互动了。
[00:13:25.180] I had with my neighbors at the time. Honestly, I think that makes sense. Because probably in like
[00:13:25.180] 我当时和邻居们有过这样的经历。说实话，我觉得这很合理。因为可能在……
[00:13:31.160] a single family home neighborhood, your neighbors are a little more permanent. Usually if you change
[00:13:31.160] 在独栋住宅区，你的邻居相对来说比较稳定。通常情况下，如果你搬家，邻居们也会比较固定。
[00:13:37.540] neighbors, it's probably because someone sold their home versus like apartments is just like
[00:13:37.540] 邻居们，可能是因为有人卖掉了房子，而公寓的情况则恰恰相反。
[00:13:42.920] constant, you know, lease changes, you know, people are moving in and out all the time. They're
[00:13:42.920] 你知道，租约经常变动，人们总是搬进搬出。
[00:13:48.660] probably way less permanent. Yeah. And I think it's a little interesting because yes, in a sense,
[00:13:48.660] 可能没那么持久。是的。我觉得这有点意思，因为从某种意义上说，
[00:13:55.920] apartments are way more transient in terms of how long you live there. But you also interact with
[00:13:55.920] 公寓的居住时间更短，流动性也更大。但你也会与他人互动。
[00:14:02.420] your neighbors a little bit more, right? Like you see them in the elevator or in the lobby, or I don't
[00:14:02.420] 和邻居们相处的时间是不是更多一些？比如在电梯里或者大厅里看到他们，或者我看不到他们
[00:14:08.720] know, some apartments, you like share a laundry room or something like that. But even so, I feel like
[00:14:08.720] 我知道，有些公寓需要共用洗衣房之类的。但即便如此，我还是觉得
[00:14:13.980] there was always distance and a little bit more like privacy in a sense. Versus now, for example,
[00:14:13.980] 以前总是保持着一定的距离，某种程度上也更注重隐私。而现在，例如，
[00:14:20.880] if my neighbors have like a party and host people, like I always notice. I'm always like, oh, there's
[00:14:20.880] 如果我的邻居举办派对招待客人，我总是会注意到。我总是会想，哦，那里有客人。
[00:14:25.940] like a bunch of cars there, like wonder who's over. Oh my god, that's so true. You're like, who on the
[00:14:25.940] 就像那里停了一堆车，你会想，会不会是谁来了？我的天，说得太对了。你会想，谁在那儿？
[00:14:31.320] street is responsible for all these extra cars this week? Exactly. Not necessarily negative,
[00:14:31.320] 这周街上多出来的车都是这条街造成的吗？没错。这倒不一定是坏事。
[00:14:38.040] but I definitely do have a little bit of nosiness in terms of our street neighbors. Honestly, that's a
[00:14:38.040] 但我确实对我们街坊邻居有点儿爱管闲事。说实话，这……
[00:14:44.800] good point. In a sense, it's more private because we're all living in like our own separate homes.
[00:14:44.800] 说得对。从某种意义上说，这样更私密，因为我们都住在各自独立的房子里。
[00:14:51.160] But in another way, certain things are a little more public. Because as you said, right, like if
[00:14:51.160] 但从另一个角度来看，有些事情则更公开一些。因为正如你所说，对吧，比如如果
[00:14:56.500] someone's throwing a party, there's going to be a few more cars on the street. You can sometimes tell
[00:14:56.500] 有人要办派对，街上肯定会多停几辆车。有时候你能感觉到。
[00:15:01.460] if someone's not home because like, right, maybe their car is gone from the driveway. And then
[00:15:01.460] 如果有人不在家，比如说，他们的车可能不在车道上。
[00:15:06.720] sometimes you would know if someone's like out traveling because maybe they'll ask you or another
[00:15:06.720] 有时候你会知道某人是不是外出旅行了，因为他们可能会问你或其他什么人。
[00:15:12.580] neighbor to like help them pick up their mail. Yeah, that actually reminds me of my family house,
[00:15:12.580] 邻居帮忙取邮件什么的。是啊，这让我想起了我家。
[00:15:19.520] my childhood home that I used to live in with my parents. And back then, we lived in like a little
[00:15:19.520] 那是我小时候和父母一起住的家。那时候，我们住得就像个小房子一样。
[00:15:24.760] cul-de-sac. And I feel like one of our neighbors was like the court leader. So as soon as my parents
[00:15:24.760] 死胡同。我觉得我们的一位邻居就像是法庭的头目。所以，我父母刚一来，我们就……
[00:15:32.100] moved in, he like came over, introduced himself to us, basically gave us like a rundown of who lives
[00:15:32.100] 他搬进来后，过来跟我们做了自我介绍，大致介绍了一下家里都有哪些人。
[00:15:38.800] in this neighborhood and which house and who has lived here the longest, etc. So I remember when we
[00:15:38.800] 在这个街区，哪栋房子，谁住得最久等等。所以我记得我们
[00:15:44.320] used to go on like family vacations, for example, we would always let him know. And then he would grab
[00:15:44.320] 以前我们像全家度假那样出去玩，总会提前告诉他。然后他就会抓起……
[00:15:49.920] our mail sometimes or like, you know, sometimes he would help with our bins. In general, he was just
[00:15:49.920] 有时候他会帮我们收邮件，或者，你知道，有时候他会帮我们收垃圾。总的来说，他就是
[00:15:55.380] like our go-to person. I do feel like that was kind of special in a sense because I don't necessarily
[00:15:55.380] 就像我们的得力助手一样。我觉得这在某种程度上挺特别的，因为我并不一定……
[00:16:00.820] think that every cul-de-sac or every street has someone like that. But it does make me wonder if
[00:16:00.820] 我觉得每个死胡同或每条街道上都有这样的人。但这确实让我怀疑……
[00:16:07.500] there is a lot of opportunity to like create that kind of vibe because this guy used to host
[00:16:07.500] 因为这个人以前是主持人，所以有很多机会可以营造那种氛围。
[00:16:13.280] block parties, dude. Whoa. Yeah, I guess like you have the chance to become your street leader.
[00:16:13.280] 街区派对，老兄。哇哦。是啊，我猜你有机会成为你那条街的领袖。
[00:16:19.920] True. I guess maybe that neighbor of yours wanted to create like almost an HOA environment without
[00:16:19.920] 没错。我猜你那位邻居可能想营造一种类似业主协会的氛围，但又没有业主协会。
[00:16:29.380] having to pay the HOA fees. I feel like block parties is sometimes an HOA hosted event. True.
[00:16:29.380] 还得交物业费。我觉得街区派对有时候就是物业公司组织的活动。确实如此。
[00:16:36.200] And I do feel like the way our neighborhood was shaped made the number of homes in that court like
[00:16:36.200] 而且我确实觉得我们社区的形成方式决定了那条街上的房屋数量。
[00:16:43.100] very limited. So it was probably also easier to get like a smaller group of households to commit to
[00:16:43.100] 非常有限。因此，可能也更容易让一小群家庭承诺参与。
[00:16:49.060] like a block party versus a really long street, for example. True. But he used to go all out. He would
[00:16:49.060] 例如，街区派对和一条很长的街道派对就截然不同。没错。但他以前总是全力以赴。他会
[00:16:55.180] get permits from the city once a year for our block party and block, you know, like those road closure
[00:16:55.180] 每年我们都要向市政府申请一次街区派对和街区封闭之类的许可。
[00:17:02.060] signs that you can get. He would block out the entrances for each side so that only people in
[00:17:02.060] 你可以拿到一些指示牌。他会封锁两侧的入口，这样只有里面的人才能进去。
[00:17:08.760] our neighborhood could like drive in, but other people couldn't. Whoa. Wow, that's legit. Yeah. Maybe
[00:17:08.760] 我们小区的人可以开车进去，但其他人不行。哇哦。哇，这太离谱了。是啊。也许吧。
[00:17:14.840] he just really liked hosting parties and being like a super nice guy. That's true. Part of me also
[00:17:14.840] 他就是很喜欢举办派对，而且人特别好。没错。我也有同感。
[00:17:21.320] wonders if that was only possible because he was from a specific generation. So he was definitely a lot
[00:17:21.320] 他想知道这是否只有因为他出身于特定年代才有可能。所以他肯定非常……
[00:17:28.380] older. And I feel like people from that generation are way more community oriented, used to being close
[00:17:28.380] 年纪大了。我觉得那一代人更注重社区，习惯了亲密无间的关系。
[00:17:38.140] friends with your neighbors, like used to chatting up people in the supermarkets and whatnot versus
[00:17:38.140] 和邻居交朋友，比如习惯在超市里和人聊天之类的。
[00:17:42.880] people in our generation, I feel like can be a little bit more private or closed off to strangers.
[00:17:42.880] 我觉得我们这一代人可能比较注重隐私，或者对陌生人比较封闭。
[00:17:47.720] So I don't know. I hope people do continue those traditions. But maybe it is something that kind
[00:17:47.720] 所以我也不知道。我希望人们能继续保持这些传统。但也许就是这样吧。
[00:17:55.480] of dies off with that subset of people. You're right. I think it's probably more possible
[00:17:55.480] 会随着那部分人群的消亡而消失。你说得对。我觉得这更有可能。
[00:18:02.340] with people who have been in their neighborhood for a long time. Because I'm just imagining like,
[00:18:02.340] 和那些在附近住了很久的人一起。因为我脑海里浮现的画面是这样的：
[00:18:09.700] you know, say one of us moves into a brand new neighborhood. And then we try to like knock on
[00:18:09.700] 你知道，比如说我们当中有人搬到了一个全新的社区。然后我们试着敲敲门……
[00:18:14.660] everyone's doors and like set a community vibe. And they're like, dude, you literally just moved
[00:18:14.660] 大家挨家挨户敲门，营造出一种社区氛围。然后他们会说，哥们儿，你才刚搬过来呢。
[00:18:19.960] in here like yesterday. Yeah. Who do you think you are basically? Right? Right, right. But if it was
[00:18:19.960] 就像昨天一样。是啊。你以为你是谁？对吧？对，对。但如果是
[00:18:25.800] like someone who knocks on your door after you just move in, and they're like, yeah, I've been living
[00:18:25.800] 就像你刚搬进来就有人敲门，然后说：“是啊，我一直住在这里。”
[00:18:30.860] in this neighborhood for like 50 years. These are like some of the things we do together, blah, blah, blah,
[00:18:30.860] 在这个社区住了大概50年了。这些都是我们一起做的一些事情，等等等等。
[00:18:36.560] blah. I feel like that's much more like, oh, okay, like that's the kind of neighborhood I've moved
[00:18:36.560] 唉。我觉得这更像是，哦，好吧，这就是我搬来的那种社区。
[00:18:41.000] into. True, true. It's easier to be the leader of the block when you've known the history longer,
[00:18:41.000] 没错，没错。对历史了解得越久，就越容易成为街区的领导者。
[00:18:47.540] you've been there longer, etc. Yeah, and I think you're right. I feel like I've noticed this too,
[00:18:47.540] 你待在那儿的时间更长，等等。是啊，我觉得你说得对。我也注意到这一点了。
[00:18:52.740] as I've gotten older. Like I interact with my neighbors a lot less. Like the street that I grew
[00:18:52.740] 随着年龄增长，我和邻居的互动也越来越少。就像我成长的那条街一样。
[00:18:58.100] up on, a lot of families were kind of in similar stages of life. There were like children growing up
[00:18:58.100] 在那个年代，很多家庭都处于相似的人生阶段。孩子们都在成长……
[00:19:04.020] on the street who were close to my age, or maybe a little bit older, and we would all hang out and
[00:19:04.020] 街上那些和我年龄相仿，或者比我稍大一些的人，我们经常一起玩耍。
[00:19:10.480] play on the streets a lot. But as I got older, and like seen a couple different neighborhoods,
[00:19:10.480] 我小时候经常在街上玩耍。但随着年龄增长，也去过几个不同的街区之后，
[00:19:16.620] it just felt like that vibe wasn't really there anymore. Maybe like the age of the people in the
[00:19:16.620] 感觉那种氛围已经不复存在了。也许是因为那里的人们年纪大了。
[00:19:22.680] neighborhood was like much more staggered. So then it just didn't feel as like, oh, everyone here is
[00:19:22.680] 社区的布局更加错落有致。所以感觉上，并不是那种“哦，这里每个人都……”的感觉。
[00:19:30.380] growing up together. Right? Yeah, maybe that's something that happens with, I don't know, I guess
[00:19:30.380] 一起长大，对吧？嗯，也许这就是会发生的事，我也不知道，我猜
[00:19:35.760] there's no hard and fast rule for like which neighborhoods foster what types of relationships
[00:19:35.760] 对于哪些社区更有利于哪些类型的人际关系，并没有硬性规定。
[00:19:41.360] with neighbors. But I have to imagine if you were moving into like, say, a neighborhood of new builds,
[00:19:41.360] 与邻居相处。但我得想象一下，如果你搬进的是一个新建的住宅区，
[00:19:47.920] where a lot of people are moving into their first starter home, a lot of people are similar ages and
[00:19:47.920] 在许多人搬进他们的第一套首套房的地方，许多人的年龄都比较相近，
[00:19:53.620] similar like stages of life, then it might be easier to get to know other families in the neighborhood,
[00:19:53.620] 如果人生阶段相似，那么就更容易结识邻里其他家庭。
[00:19:59.340] just because you might all be starting out at like a certain age group and might all be like starting
[00:19:59.340] 仅仅因为你们可能都是从某个年龄段开始，而且可能都是刚起步。
[00:20:04.120] families or something, versus exactly what you said with like staggered ages and different stages
[00:20:04.120] 家庭之类的，而不是像你说的，年龄错开、阶段不同的情况。
[00:20:10.600] of life and whatnot, like it might feel a little bit harder. So maybe it's kind of a neighborhood
[00:20:10.600] 生活等等方面，感觉可能会有点难。所以也许这是一种邻里关系。
[00:20:15.960] thing and not necessarily a generation thing. Maybe. But I feel like it could maybe be a generation
[00:20:15.960] 这或许不只是代际差异，也许吧。但我感觉这可能确实与一代人有关。
[00:20:23.360] thing. But I'm also just thinking like, for example, like my parents, they're like immigrants,
[00:20:23.360] 事情就是这样。但我也在想，比如说，像我的父母，他们就像移民一样，
[00:20:29.600] and they you know, they don't really speak super great English. So I feel like maybe it's harder
[00:20:29.600] 而且你知道，他们的英语说得其实不是很好。所以我感觉这可能更难。
[00:20:35.800] for them to sometimes reach out to neighbors, even if that's something that maybe they want to do.
[00:20:35.800] 让他们有时主动与邻居联系，即使这可能是他们想做的事情。
[00:20:42.280] But they like feel a bit shy or like not confident in their language skills. I do think my parents
[00:20:42.280] 但他们似乎有点害羞，或者对自己的语言能力不太自信。我确实觉得我的父母
[00:20:48.920] occasionally try to get to know our immediate neighbors on the left and right side. But I think
[00:20:48.920] 偶尔试着去了解一下我们左右两边的邻居。但我认为
[00:20:55.120] it's not always super easy to be the ones like reaching out, especially if they're at a like a
[00:20:55.120] 主动联系别人并不总是那么容易，尤其是在对方处于某种状态的时候。
[00:21:01.020] disadvantage in some way. Yeah, that's a good point. I feel like there's a specific environment that
[00:21:01.020] 在某些方面处于劣势。是的，你说得对。我觉得在某种特定的环境下，
[00:21:08.360] makes you feel more comfortable to do so versus other times you might feel more restricted or kind of
[00:21:08.360] 这样做会让你感觉更自在，而其他时候你可能会感到更受限或有点……
[00:21:13.840] like, oh, should I like, I don't know if I want to bother people, etc. Yeah, like I know for sure.
[00:21:13.840] 比如，哦，我应该……我不知道我是否想打扰别人等等。是啊，好像我很确定似的。
[00:21:18.760] At one point, my neighbors were this like, young Asian couple. And I think it was easier for my
[00:21:18.760] 有段时间，我的邻居是一对年轻的亚裔夫妇。我觉得这对我的邻居来说更容易相处。
[00:21:26.620] parents to communicate with them, especially once they found out that they could speak Chinese too.
[00:21:26.620] 父母要和他们沟通，尤其是在发现他们也会说中文之后。
[00:21:32.160] So it was just like a little easier to, you know, converse with them versus trying to speak with
[00:21:32.160] 所以和他们交谈比尝试和别人说话要容易一些。
[00:21:38.180] their like, slightly more chunky English with like other neighbors. Yeah. So it's like I could tell
[00:21:38.180] 他们的英语听起来有点生硬，跟其他邻居的英语不太一样。是啊。所以我能听出来。
[00:21:45.440] they were a little closer to that young Asian couple than our other neighbor who they did put
[00:21:45.440] 他们和那对年轻的亚裔夫妇的关系比和我们另一位邻居的关系更密切一些，他们确实把那对邻居安置在了……
[00:21:51.160] an effort to get to know and talk to every now and then. But there was just a noticeable difference
[00:21:51.160] 我们努力去了解彼此，也时不时地和他们聊聊天。但确实存在一个明显的差异。
[00:21:57.300] between closeness. I do also think people's individual personalities or maybe even just
[00:21:57.300] 亲密程度之间。我也认为人们的个人性格，或者甚至仅仅是
[00:22:03.080] specifically their expectations of what they want from their neighbors could also be a big factor.
[00:22:03.080] 具体来说，他们对邻居的期望也可能是一个重要因素。
[00:22:08.720] Because when James and I moved into our house, we actually made the rounds of every kind of adjacent
[00:22:08.720] 因为当我和詹姆斯搬进新家时，我们实际上把所有类型的邻近房屋都考察了一遍。
[00:22:15.320] neighbor. So like the two on our left and right, and then also the two homes kind of across from our
[00:22:15.320] 邻居。比如我们左边和右边的两户人家，还有我们家对面那两户人家。
[00:22:20.920] house. And we brought everyone like a small treat. And we were just like, hi, you know, we just moved in.
[00:22:20.920] 房子。我们带了些小礼物给大家。我们就像在说，嗨，你知道，我们刚搬进来。
[00:22:27.140] Here's like a little token of our appreciation for you being our neighbor, blah, blah, blah,
[00:22:27.140] 这是我们对您作为邻居的一点小感谢，等等等等。
[00:22:32.280] and introduced ourselves. And I think certain neighbors were definitely more receptive to it
[00:22:32.280] 我们做了自我介绍。我觉得有些邻居确实更容易接受这种做法。
[00:22:38.120] and more open to getting to know us versus other neighbors. It is like a pretty noticeable difference.
[00:22:38.120] 他们更愿意了解我们，而不是像其他邻居那样。这种差别非常明显。
[00:22:43.960] Yeah, to this day, it's not like we're best friends with our neighbors, but I feel like
[00:22:43.960] 是的，直到今天，我们和邻居也算不上是最好的朋友，但我感觉
[00:22:47.900] we're on better terms with some neighbors than other ones.
[00:22:47.900] 我们和一些邻居的关系比和其他邻居的关系要好。
[00:22:51.680] Yeah, I think that makes total sense, too. Especially like, if you have a super introverted neighbor,
[00:22:51.680] 是啊，我觉得这完全说得通。尤其是如果你有个超级内向的邻居，
[00:22:57.240] I wouldn't imagine that they're, you know, like hitting you up every day and like asking you for favors.
[00:22:57.240] 我不会想象他们会每天都来找你，让你帮他们做事。
[00:23:02.000] And all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:02.000] 以及所有类似的事情。
[00:23:03.640] Right, right. Yeah, like some of our neighbors sometimes ask us for lemons, and we like give
[00:23:03.640] 对，对。是啊，就像我们的一些邻居有时会问我们要柠檬，我们也乐意给他们。
[00:23:09.060] it to them. And then other neighbors, sometimes when I see them on the street, I'm like, does this
[00:23:09.060] 告诉他们。然后其他邻居，有时候我在街上看到他们，我就会想，他们是不是也这样？
[00:23:13.360] person want me to say hi? Or not? Like, should I wave? Or should I? There's some hesitation there.
[00:23:13.360] 对方想让我打招呼吗？还是不想？比如，我该挥手吗？还是不该？我有点犹豫。
[00:23:19.060] Not hostility, but I'm like, I don't know if they want me to acknowledge their existence.
[00:23:19.060] 不是敌意，而是感觉，我不知道他们是否希望我承认他们的存在。
[00:23:24.100] Yeah. They're like, oh god, Jisoo waved at me. Like, I was just trying to fucking walk by invisibly.
[00:23:24.100] 是啊。她们就像，天哪，Jisoo 跟我挥手了。可我当时只是想悄无声息地走过去而已。
[00:23:30.400] Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:30.400] 对，没错。
[00:23:31.960] I totally feel that, though. I was, like, going back to my current neighbor, I was thinking about it
[00:23:31.960] 我完全有同感。我当时就在想，要不要再跟我现在的邻居聊聊了。
[00:23:36.820] because when I asked you and James if either of you could, like, pick up the package when I was traveling,
[00:23:36.820] 因为当我问过你和詹姆斯，你们俩能不能在我旅行的时候帮我取一下包裹时，
[00:23:44.220] I realized in that moment, I was like, damn, I totally should have introduced myself to the neighbors.
[00:23:44.220] 那一刻我意识到，糟了，我真应该向邻居们自我介绍一下。
[00:23:48.120] We literally share a garage. Like, they could have just picked up my package and, like, tossed it in
[00:23:48.120] 我们共用一个车库。他们完全可以把我的包裹取走，然后直接扔进去。
[00:23:53.340] the garage if I knew them. I could have asked them for that favor.
[00:23:53.340] 如果我认识他们，我肯定会去修车厂。我可以请他们帮个忙。
[00:23:58.300] Yeah, I feel like that's also a big step, though, because I think to this day, we have been living
[00:23:58.300] 是的，我觉得这也是一大步，因为我觉得直到今天，我们一直都生活在……
[00:24:03.240] in this house for three and a half years now, and we've asked people for favors maybe, like, once.
[00:24:03.240] 我们在这所房子里住了三年半了，可能只求过别人帮忙一次。
[00:24:10.480] And that favor that we asked them to do was like, oh, can you just check if this thing is still in our
[00:24:10.480] 我们请他们帮忙的那个忙就是，哦，你们能不能帮我查一下这东西是否还在我们这里？
[00:24:15.720] driveway? Like, it wasn't even like, oh, can you do something? It was literally like, can you, like,
[00:24:15.720] 车道？就好像，根本不是那种“哦，你能做点什么吗？”的语气，而是那种“你能，比如，……”的直接语气。
[00:24:19.460] look outside your window? So I feel like even making that step to be like, oh, do you mind getting the
[00:24:19.460] 你看看窗外？所以我感觉，哪怕只是迈出那一步，比如问：“哦，你介意拿一下吗？”
[00:24:24.520] package and just holding it for a day feels so big.
[00:24:24.520] 包裹很大，拿着它一天都感觉很大。
[00:24:27.840] Yeah, it does. It does feel big. But then when you think about it, like, in the bigger picture,
[00:24:27.840] 是的，确实如此。感觉规模很大。但当你仔细想想，从更宏观的角度来看，
[00:24:32.860] you're kind of like, okay, but is it, you know, I'm, like, their neighbor. Is it that big of a deal?
[00:24:32.860] 你会想，好吧，但是，你知道，我是他们的邻居。这有那么严重吗？
[00:24:37.040] They're taking, like, three steps over.
[00:24:37.040] 他们大概走了三步。
[00:24:40.160] I know. It's like, if they asked me to do this, I would do it without even thinking about it.
[00:24:40.160] 我知道。就好像，如果他们让我做这件事，我根本不用想就会去做。
[00:24:44.180] Exactly.
[00:24:44.180] 确切地。
[00:24:45.720] So why are we so scared to ask them?
[00:24:45.720] 那我们为什么这么害怕问他们呢？
[00:24:47.980] I don't know.
[00:24:47.980] 我不知道。
[00:24:49.420] I think, like, right now, the good thing, though, is that I don't get much mail here.
[00:24:49.420] 不过我觉得，现在的好处是，我在这里收不到多少邮件。
[00:24:55.100] I think I check my mailbox once every one to two weeks, and all I get are, like, ads for, like,
[00:24:55.100] 我大概每隔一到两周查看一次邮箱，收到的都是些广告，比如……
[00:25:02.400] Costco.
[00:25:02.400] 好市多。
[00:25:03.420] Right, right.
[00:25:03.420] 对，对。
[00:25:04.640] And so I'm like, okay, at least if I'm traveling, like, I don't need someone to try to dig into
[00:25:04.640] 所以我就想，好吧，至少如果我在旅行，我就不需要有人来挖苦我了。
[00:25:09.400] my mailbox and, like, make it look like someone's living here.
[00:25:09.400] 我的邮箱，让它看起来像有人住在这里一样。
[00:25:14.780] It's empty anyway.
[00:25:14.780] 反正里面是空的。
[00:25:16.220] Yeah, it's literally empty anyways.
[00:25:16.220] 是啊，反正里面也空空荡荡的。
[00:25:18.540] But I do always wonder, like, if neighbors notice that you're, like, gone.
[00:25:18.540] 但我总是会想，邻居们会不会注意到你不在家。
[00:25:25.180] Because in my mind, at least, I feel like there are some obvious signs when I'm gone, at least.
[00:25:25.180] 因为至少在我看来，当我离开的时候，总会有一些明显的迹象。
[00:25:31.360] Especially because it's, like, it's just one person.
[00:25:31.360] 尤其是因为这只是一个人。
[00:25:34.020] Like, there's no car movement.
[00:25:34.020] 就像，根本没有车辆行驶。
[00:25:36.820] Maybe that's the most obvious thing, because I sometimes automate my lights to turn on and off when I'm gone.
[00:25:36.820] 也许这是最显而易见的，因为我有时会设置自动开关灯，这样在我外出时灯就会自动开关。
[00:25:42.600] Yeah, I also automate my lights, but I think it can be kind of confusing.
[00:25:42.600] 是的，我也设置了灯光自动化，但我认为这可能会让人有点困惑。
[00:25:48.440] So, like, if your car is missing, they definitely know you're gone.
[00:25:48.440] 所以，如果你的车不见了，他们肯定知道你不在家。
[00:25:52.660] Right.
[00:25:52.660] 正确的。
[00:25:52.980] I feel like that's, like, a telltale sign.
[00:25:52.980] 我觉得这就像是一个明显的迹象。
[00:25:55.160] But if your car is still there and, say, you, like, took a flight somewhere,
[00:25:55.160] 但如果你的车还停在那里，而你，比如说，乘飞机去了某个地方，
[00:25:59.240] they might not know whether your car has been moving or not.
[00:25:59.240] 他们可能不知道你的车是否移动过。
[00:26:02.600] That's true.
[00:26:02.600] 这是真的。
[00:26:03.280] Unless it's your, like, I guess for you it's kind of different because you live in a duplex.
[00:26:03.280] 除非是你，我想对你来说情况有点不同，因为你住在复式公寓里。
[00:26:07.640] Like, they would definitely notice, huh?
[00:26:07.640] 他们肯定会注意到的，对吧？
[00:26:09.060] I feel like they should.
[00:26:09.060] 我觉得他们应该这么做。
[00:26:10.800] They would probably be like, oh, this person, like, has not left this home in, like, a week, like, in two weeks.
[00:26:10.800] 他们可能会说，哦，这个人好像已经一个星期、两个星期没离开过家了。
[00:26:20.800] Like, are they okay?
[00:26:20.800] 他们还好吗？
[00:26:22.920] It's like you're still there.
[00:26:22.920] 感觉你好像还在那里。
[00:26:24.580] You're just inside hibernating.
[00:26:24.580] 你只是在里面冬眠而已。
[00:26:29.300] But, yeah, I always wonder, like, is the move to tell your neighbor that you're going to be gone?
[00:26:29.300] 但是，是啊，我总是在想，是不是应该告诉邻居你要离开一段时间？
[00:26:35.920] It probably is.
[00:26:35.920] 很有可能。
[00:26:37.460] So, in our, like, childhood home, that cul-de-sac had robberies happen.
[00:26:37.460] 所以，在我们小时候住的那条死胡同里，发生过抢劫案。
[00:26:44.500] I think it was maybe just once.
[00:26:44.500] 我想可能只有一次吧。
[00:26:46.780] But the thing is, like, if your neighbors know you're gone and there's, like, clearly no one who's going to come visit your house,
[00:26:46.780] 但问题是，如果你的邻居知道你不在家，而且显然没有人会来你家拜访，
[00:26:55.060] then they would probably know, like, if they were to see a car go in, they would probably be able to tell that it's, like, not normal.
[00:26:55.060] 这样他们可能就会知道，比如，如果他们看到一辆车进去，他们可能就能看出这不正常。
[00:27:03.000] So, I think it is kind of, like, a safety thing.
[00:27:03.000] 所以，我觉得这有点像是出于安全考虑。
[00:27:06.240] But part of me also is just sometimes it feels so extra to be, like, hey, I'm going to be out of town.
[00:27:06.240] 但有时候，我也会觉得，好像要出差一样，有点小题大做。
[00:27:11.980] Yeah.
[00:27:11.980] 是的。
[00:27:12.380] Like, I just imagine them being, like, so, right?
[00:27:12.380] 我脑海里浮现的画面就是，非常非常对？
[00:27:15.760] Like, why do I care?
[00:27:15.760] 我为什么要关心这些？
[00:27:17.280] Yeah.
[00:27:17.280] 是的。
[00:27:19.740] I guess I could tell my neighbor, like, hey, I'll be out of town.
[00:27:19.740] 我想我可以告诉我的邻居，比如，嘿，我要出城了。
[00:27:23.140] You can use my, like, driveway spot while I'm gone.
[00:27:23.140] 我不在家的时候，你可以用我的车位，比如车道上的停车位。
[00:27:25.300] Oh, that's a good point.
[00:27:25.300] 哦，你说得对。
[00:27:26.580] Yeah.
[00:27:26.580] 是的。
[00:27:27.540] And then I could be, like, can you also get my mail?
[00:27:27.540] 然后我可能会问，你能帮我收一下邮件吗？
[00:27:35.200] It's both an alert and a request.
[00:27:35.200] 它既是警报，也是请求。
[00:27:37.460] Yeah.
[00:27:37.460] 是的。
[00:27:39.520] But that's, like, kind of my goal right now.
[00:27:39.520] 但那正是我现在的目标。
[00:27:41.780] I want to have, like, an okay relationship with them where we would feel comfortable asking each other to, like, look out for packages if and when we're traveling.
[00:27:41.780] 我希望和他们建立一种还算不错的关系，这样我们旅行的时候就可以放心地请对方帮忙留意包裹。
[00:27:52.760] Because I think most of our friends don't really live super close to me.
[00:27:52.760] 因为我觉得我们的大多数朋友其实都住得离我不太近。
[00:27:56.580] So I feel like it seems a bit of a hassle to, like, ask someone, oh, can you drive all the way over when I have a, like, neighbor right there?
[00:27:56.580] 所以我觉得，如果我的邻居就在我家附近，还要问别人“你能开车过来吗？”，这似乎有点麻烦。
[00:28:05.820] You know what I mean?
[00:28:05.820] 你知道我的意思？
[00:28:07.660] Yeah, I feel that.
[00:28:07.660] 是的，我也有同感。
[00:28:08.660] I think even to this day, sometimes when James and I are going to be out of town for a long time, we ask his mom, like, oh, do you mind bringing the bins in or something like that?
[00:28:08.660] 我觉得即使到了今天，有时候我和詹姆斯要出城很长时间，我们还是会问他妈妈，比如，哦，您介意把垃圾桶搬进来吗？
[00:28:16.840] Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:16.840] 是啊是啊。
[00:28:17.800] But that totally is something that you can ask your neighbors to do, especially because you can always return the favor, right?
[00:28:17.800] 但你完全可以请邻居这样做，尤其是因为你总能回报他们的好意，对吧？
[00:28:25.300] Exactly.
[00:28:25.300] 确切地。
[00:28:26.200] Wow, now that I think about it, our parents are so lucky.
[00:28:26.200] 哇，现在想想，我们的父母真是太幸运了。
[00:28:29.360] Whenever my parents are out of town, they're always like, oh, Crystal, like, can you house sit?
[00:28:29.360] 每当我父母出差在外时，他们总是会说：“哦，Crystal，你能帮我照看一下房子吗？”
[00:28:33.740] Or, like, when I was still living with them, sometimes they would often go out without me and I would just be, like, home alone, you know, living there.
[00:28:33.740] 或者，比如，当我还和他们住在一起的时候，他们经常会不等我就出去，而我就会一个人待在家里，你知道，住在那里。
[00:28:42.240] Right.
[00:28:42.240] 正确的。
[00:28:43.040] Taking care of all the mail and everything.
[00:28:43.040] 负责处理所有邮件和其他事务。
[00:28:45.040] And I'm like, wow, they just have a free house sitter.
[00:28:45.040] 我当时就想，哇，他们居然免费雇了个看房子的人。
[00:28:47.700] They don't need to call their neighbor up or, like, ask their friends, hey, can you pick up that package that got delivered?
[00:28:47.700] 他们不需要打电话给邻居，或者问朋友：“嘿，你能帮忙取一下送来的包裹吗？”
[00:28:53.540] Yeah.
[00:28:53.540] 是的。
[00:28:53.980] I think the funniest thing, too, is sometimes they'll come back and I'll be like, oh, you got, like, a couple packages, I brought them in, I left them on your desk or whatever.
[00:28:53.980] 我觉得最搞笑的是，有时候他们会回来，我会说，哦，你收到了几个包裹，我把它们带来了，我把它们放在你的桌子上之类的。
[00:29:02.660] And then my dad's like, I had packages come in?
[00:29:02.660] 然后我爸就说，我这儿有包裹到了？
[00:29:05.920] Like, they don't even know.
[00:29:05.920] 他们根本就不知道。
[00:29:09.400] Yeah, it's honestly a great system when you have either friends or, like, family close by.
[00:29:09.400] 是的，如果你有朋友或者家人在附近，这套系统确实很棒。
[00:29:13.820] Because then you don't have to bother your neighbors.
[00:29:13.820] 这样你就不用打扰邻居了。
[00:29:16.060] Yeah, it really, in reality, it truly should be the inverse.
[00:29:16.060] 是的，实际上，情况应该恰恰相反。
[00:29:19.520] Oh, my God, so true.
[00:29:19.520] 我的天哪，说得太对了。
[00:29:21.560] But I guess it's a little different sometimes when it's, like, it's nice to have someone who is, like, a close friend or a family member who can, like, actually go into the home versus just, like, drive-by mail pickup or something like that.
[00:29:21.560] 但我觉得有时候情况会有点不同，比如，如果能有亲密的朋友或家人亲自上门取件，而不是像开车路过取邮件之类的，那就更好了。
[00:29:38.780] True, true.
[00:29:38.780] 没错，没错。
[00:29:39.840] Dude, but would you ever trust a friend to, like, literally house-sit your home?
[00:29:39.840] 哥们儿，你会放心让朋友帮你照看房子吗？
[00:29:44.180] I think trust-wise, yes, definitely.
[00:29:44.180] 我认为就信任而言，是的，绝对是。
[00:29:48.120] But, one, I don't know if I would want to bother them like that.
[00:29:48.120] 但是，首先，我不知道我是否愿意那样去打扰他们。
[00:29:52.460] I think I also just don't really understand the concept of house-sitting.
[00:29:52.460] 我觉得我可能不太理解房屋看护的概念。
[00:29:56.700] Like, unless I'm going to be out of town for, like, months and months.
[00:29:56.700] 除非我要出差好几个月。
[00:29:59.680] Right.
[00:29:59.680] 正确的。
[00:30:00.000] I don't know if it's truly necessary.
[00:30:00.000] 我不知道这是否真的有必要。
[00:30:02.660] Yeah.
[00:30:02.660] 是的。
[00:30:03.100] Besides just, like, the mail and packages and whatnot.
[00:30:03.100] 除了邮件、包裹之类的东西之外。
[00:30:05.960] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:05.960] 嗯。
[00:30:06.800] Yeah, I guess also because most people, like, have their own place here.
[00:30:06.800] 是啊，我想也是因为这里大多数人都有自己的房子。
[00:30:11.140] So it's like, oh, why would they necessarily need to, like, house-sit?
[00:30:11.140] 所以问题就来了，哦，他们为什么一定要去帮人看房子呢？
[00:30:15.500] Right.
[00:30:15.500] 正确的。
[00:30:15.880] But I do think one of the most common possibilities would be, like, if you have a pet.
[00:30:15.880] 但我认为最常见的可能性之一是，比如，如果你养宠物。
[00:30:21.400] True, true, true.
[00:30:21.400] 没错，没错，没错。
[00:30:22.420] And I know a lot of people who live in, like, New York or San Francisco or, like, big cities, for example, when they travel, they either do apartment swaps or have someone sublet for, like, a couple weeks or something like that.
[00:30:22.420] 我知道很多住在纽约、旧金山或其他大城市的人，比如他们旅行时，要么会和别人交换公寓，要么会找人转租几个星期之类的。
[00:30:35.040] Right.
[00:30:35.040] 正确的。
[00:30:35.180] So I know it's common, but I just think deep down, I would feel a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:30:35.180] 我知道这很常见，但我内心深处还是会感到有点不自在。
[00:30:41.260] Yeah, I'm just imagining someone, like, flipping through all my shit.
[00:30:41.260] 是啊，我脑海里就浮现出有人翻看我所有东西的画面。
[00:30:43.900] Like, oh, this is, like, you know, what's in Crystal's home.
[00:30:43.900] 比如，哦，这就是，你知道的，克里斯托家里的东西。
[00:30:48.340] Or, like, even someone sleeping in my bed or something.
[00:30:48.340] 或者，比如，有人睡在我的床上之类的。
[00:30:51.500] I don't know.
[00:30:51.500] 我不知道。
[00:30:52.040] Just, like, I keep thinking back to Destin roasting only children a little bit in our episode last week.
[00:30:52.040] 我总是想起上周那期节目里，Destin 稍微调侃了一下独生子女。
[00:30:59.340] But I think as an only child, it's hard for me to imagine people sleeping in my bed or, like, using my monitor or, I don't know, any trivial thing like that.
[00:30:59.340] 但我觉得作为独生子女，我很难想象别人睡在我的床上，或者用我的显示器，或者，我不知道，任何类似的小事。
[00:31:09.300] I think it would give me a little bit of hesitation.
[00:31:09.300] 我想这会让我有点犹豫。
[00:31:12.180] Right, right.
[00:31:12.180] 对，对。
[00:31:13.000] That makes sense.
[00:31:13.000] 这很有道理。
[00:31:15.080] It's, like, it's always a bit weird if someone's in your home unchaperoned.
[00:31:15.080] 感觉，如果有人在你家没有监护人陪同，总会有点奇怪。
[00:31:20.780] Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:20.780] 是啊是啊。
[00:31:21.580] Exactly.
[00:31:21.580] 确切地。
[00:31:22.940] Like, ideally, you are there to chaperone them and be like, oh, yeah, like, you know, this you can use and, like, these are things you can use.
[00:31:22.940] 理想情况下，你应该陪同他们，告诉他们：“哦，是的，你知道，这个你可以用，这些东西你可以用。”
[00:31:29.620] But I think especially if it's, like, a permanent home.
[00:31:29.620] 但我觉得尤其如果这是个永久住所的话。
[00:31:35.460] Your home is, you've bought it.
[00:31:35.460] 你的家就是你的家，你已经买下了它。
[00:31:37.200] It's not a rental.
[00:31:37.200] 这不是出租房。
[00:31:38.000] It, there's, like, a bit more value where you're, like, dude, don't fuck up my walls or, you know, something like that.
[00:31:38.000] 它更有价值，就像，你会想，老兄，别把我的墙弄坏了，或者诸如此类的话。
[00:31:45.100] Versus, like, an apartment.
[00:31:45.100] 比如，一套公寓。
[00:31:46.340] It's kind of, like, oh, okay, well, this person fucked something up.
[00:31:46.340] 感觉就像，哦，好吧，这个人搞砸了。
[00:31:50.560] But worst case, I'm going to eventually move out of this place anyway, almost.
[00:31:50.560] 但最坏的情况是，我最终还是会搬出这个地方，差不多吧。
[00:31:55.620] Yeah, and I think another part of it, too, is my home is perfect for me and James.
[00:31:55.620] 是的，而且我觉得另一个原因是，我的家对我和詹姆斯来说非常完美。
[00:32:01.820] But if someone else were to stay in it, I guess I would want it to feel like a hotel or something.
[00:32:01.820] 但如果让其他人住，我想我会希望它感觉像个酒店之类的。
[00:32:07.000] Like, so then I would feel uncomfortable.
[00:32:07.000] 那样的话，我就会感到不舒服。
[00:32:09.360] Like, oh, is this, like, a good enough stay?
[00:32:09.360] 比如，哦，这样的住宿条件够好吗？
[00:32:11.760] Like, are they going to know how to use everything?
[00:32:11.760] 比如，他们会知道如何使用所有东西吗？
[00:32:13.820] That kind of trepidation also adds to the discomfort.
[00:32:13.820] 这种忐忑不安也会加剧不适感。
[00:32:17.540] Dude, I'm just imagining your home covered in sticky notes.
[00:32:17.540] 老兄，我脑补了一下你家贴满便利贴的画面。
[00:32:21.380] Like, hey, you can use these things.
[00:32:21.380] 比如，嘿，你可以用这些东西。
[00:32:23.220] Like, please feel free.
[00:32:23.220] 请随意点赞。
[00:32:24.600] Like, this is how you use the shower.
[00:32:24.600] 比如，这就是淋浴的正确使用方法。
[00:32:26.680] Like, turn this way for hot water.
[00:32:26.680] 比如，往这边转就能流热水。
[00:32:28.820] And the house sitter is like, yes, I have eyes.
[00:32:28.820] 看房人说，是的，我有眼睛。
[00:32:32.680] Like, I have a brain.
[00:32:32.680] 我又不是没脑子。
[00:32:37.320] But I think one funny thing about neighbors specifically is sometimes my nosiness can creep up a little bit.
[00:32:37.320] 但我认为关于邻居，有一件很有趣的事情是，有时我的好奇心会不知不觉地增长。
[00:32:46.960] And the thing about nosiness is, like, not only do I care a lot about what is going on in our neighbors' lives or, like, gardens or, you know, homes or whatnot.
[00:32:46.960] 而爱管闲事这件事本身，就是，我不仅非常关心邻居们的生活，比如他们的花园、房屋等等。
[00:32:57.620] But it also makes me self-conscious about what they think and observe about us.
[00:32:57.620] 但这也让我很在意他们对我们的看法和观察。
[00:33:04.600] So it's always a double-edged sword.
[00:33:04.600] 所以这始终是一把双刃剑。
[00:33:06.560] And I feel like an easy example is when your neighbor is going through, like, renovations.
[00:33:06.560] 我觉得一个简单的例子就是当你的邻居正在进行装修的时候。
[00:33:12.040] I'm always like, oh, who's the plumbing company you're using?
[00:33:12.040] 我总是问，哦，你们用的是哪家水管公司？
[00:33:15.160] You know, like, what kind of renovations are you doing?
[00:33:15.160] 你知道，比如说，你们在进行什么样的翻新工程？
[00:33:17.880] And I think this is a big reason why a lot of people go to, like, open homes in their neighborhoods.
[00:33:17.880] 我认为这是很多人喜欢去参加社区开放日活动的一个重要原因。
[00:33:22.020] Not necessarily because they want to buy a new house, but because you want to see what the setup is or what the status is of, like, the different homes in your street.
[00:33:22.020] 不一定是因为他们想买新房，而是因为你想看看你所在街道上不同房屋的布局或现状。
[00:33:32.300] But the petty example is, like, sometimes when me and James are busy, we get a lot of DoorDash.
[00:33:32.300] 但举个小例子，比如，有时候我和詹姆斯很忙的时候，我们会接到很多 DoorDash 的外卖订单。
[00:33:37.900] And I think in general, we do like to get, like, food delivery.
[00:33:37.900] 而且我觉得总的来说，我们都喜欢叫外卖。
[00:33:40.940] I always wonder if our neighbors are, like, peering out their window being like, damn, James and Jisoo got a fucking DoorDash again.
[00:33:40.940] 我总是好奇我们的邻居会不会从窗户往外看，然后想：天哪，James 和 Jisoo 又叫了 DoorDash 外卖。
[00:33:51.200] Okay, wait.
[00:33:51.200] 好的，等等。
[00:33:52.140] But do you notice when your neighbors get delivery?
[00:33:52.140] 但你有没有注意到邻居什么时候收到快递？
[00:33:56.880] Yes.
[00:33:56.880] 是的。
[00:33:57.800] Oh, fuck.
[00:33:57.800] 哦，该死。
[00:33:59.920] Like, if I see it, I will be like, oh, they got DoorDash.
[00:33:59.920] 比如，如果我看到的话，我会想，哦，他们有 DoorDash 服务。
[00:34:04.960] But obviously, like, I don't always notice or, like, catch it.
[00:34:04.960] 但很显然，我并不总是能注意到或者发现它。
[00:34:09.320] Oh, shit.
[00:34:09.320] 妈的。
[00:34:10.220] Okay, you're observant.
[00:34:10.220] 好吧，你观察力很强。
[00:34:11.280] I feel like I never look.
[00:34:11.280] 我感觉我从来没看过。
[00:34:13.780] But you're right.
[00:34:13.780] 但你说得对。
[00:34:14.840] Sometimes I do feel like, oh, my God, like, the car is pulling up to my side of the street.
[00:34:14.840] 有时我会觉得，哦，我的天哪，就像汽车开到我这边的街道上一样。
[00:34:19.840] Like, everyone can see this person run out of their car and deliver food to my doorstep.
[00:34:19.840] 就像，每个人都能看到这个人从车里出来，把食物送到我家门口。
[00:34:25.440] Right, right.
[00:34:25.440] 对，对。
[00:34:27.140] Sometimes if we get takeout, certain bags are very obvious, like, where you got it from.
[00:34:27.140] 有时我们点外卖时，有些袋子上的痕迹非常明显，一眼就能看出是从哪里买的。
[00:34:33.400] Like, Chipotle, for example.
[00:34:33.400] 比如Chipotle。
[00:34:34.760] Like, everyone knows that, you know, square brown bag that's fucking Chipotle.
[00:34:34.760] 大家都知道，就是那种方形的棕色纸袋，那就是 Chipotle 的包装。
[00:34:39.160] Like, when I carry it in, I'm like, oh, my God, everyone fucking knows I got Chipotle again.
[00:34:39.160] 就像，当我把它带进去的时候，我就想，哦，我的天哪，所有人都知道我又买了Chipotle。
[00:34:45.160] They're like, there's not even a Chipotle near us.
[00:34:45.160] 他们说，我们附近连一家 Chipotle 都没有。
[00:34:49.500] You know, these random thoughts come into my head where I'm like, you know, I'm having all these thoughts about, like, our neighbors.
[00:34:49.500] 你知道，我的脑子里会突然冒出一些随机的想法，比如，我会想到我们的邻居。
[00:34:56.140] Like, do they give this much of a shit about me?
[00:34:56.140] 他们真的这么在乎我吗？
[00:34:59.580] I see.
[00:34:59.580] 我懂了。
[00:35:00.880] I kind of feel what you mean.
[00:35:00.880] 我有点明白你的意思了。
[00:35:02.760] Because, like, my neighborhood is also, like, a residential neighborhood.
[00:35:02.760] 因为我住的地方也是一个居民区。
[00:35:05.600] It's not, like, an apartment building.
[00:35:05.600] 它不是那种公寓楼。
[00:35:07.720] So, you know, when I'm, like, on my driveway unloading groceries and stuff, literally everyone can see me.
[00:35:07.720] 你知道，当我在自家车道上卸货的时候，几乎每个人都能看到我。
[00:35:14.060] Like, they can see what I bought for my groceries.
[00:35:14.060] 比如，他们可以看到我买了什么杂货。
[00:35:17.480] Like, they can see the packages at my front door.
[00:35:17.480] 他们可以看到我家门口的包裹。
[00:35:21.160] Right, right.
[00:35:21.160] 对，对。
[00:35:21.620] Like, all of that.
[00:35:21.620] 比如，所有这些。
[00:35:23.500] It's like, it's just out on display for everyone.
[00:35:23.500] 就好像，它就那样明晃晃地摆在那里，人人都看得见。
[00:35:25.920] Oh, that neighbor bought something in a big box.
[00:35:25.920] 哦，那位邻居在大包装盒里买了东西。
[00:35:29.260] I wonder what it is.
[00:35:29.260] 我想知道那是什么。
[00:35:31.520] I know, like, when it starts to stack, I'm always like, hmm, I wonder if people saw that there's, like, four Amazon boxes.
[00:35:31.520] 我知道，当包裹开始堆积起来的时候，我总是会想，嗯，不知道有没有人注意到那里有四个亚马逊的箱子。
[00:35:38.560] Or maybe our neighbors are like, oh, ever since those new people moved in, like, the Amazon truck passes by our street a lot more.
[00:35:38.560] 或者我们的邻居可能会说，自从那些新住户搬来之后，亚马逊的货车就经常经过我们这条街了。
[00:35:49.140] I'm trying to remember what the, like, apartment complex version of this was.
[00:35:49.140] 我努力回想一下，类似公寓楼里的那种情况是什么样的。
[00:35:53.300] Because all of the apartment buildings that I lived at had, like, a male locker room.
[00:35:53.300] 因为我住过的所有公寓楼都有男士更衣室。
[00:35:58.720] Oh, okay.
[00:35:58.720] 哦好的。
[00:35:59.160] So I wasn't necessarily seeing that, like, something was on someone's doorstep, for example.
[00:35:59.160] 所以，我并不一定能看到，比如，某某人的家门口有什么东西。
[00:36:04.480] But maybe the apartment building equivalent of it is, like, you can kind of hear a little bit more if someone is having a party because you might be sharing walls with people.
[00:36:04.480] 但公寓楼里类似的例子可能是，如果有人在开派对，你可能会听到更多声音，因为你可能和别人共用墙壁。
[00:36:14.680] Or you could smell what other people are cooking.
[00:36:14.680] 或者你可以闻到别人在做饭的味道。
[00:36:18.640] That's a good one.
[00:36:18.640] 那真是个好主意。
[00:36:20.120] Yeah, like, when you walk down the halls and you're like, oh, it's, like, dinner time and it smells fucking good.
[00:36:20.120] 是啊，就像你走在走廊里，突然觉得，哦，好像到了晚餐时间，闻起来真香。
[00:36:26.100] Right, right.
[00:36:26.100] 对，对。
[00:36:26.740] You're like, oh, you guys are having this cuisine again.
[00:36:26.740] 你会想，哦，你们又吃这种菜了。
[00:36:30.120] But you're right.
[00:36:30.120] 但你说得对。
[00:36:30.940] It's usually, like, less smelly in the neighborhood, I guess, in the residential neighborhoods.
[00:36:30.940] 通常来说，在居民区，尤其是住宅区，气味会小一些。
[00:36:36.680] Unless you're walking closer to one of the homes.
[00:36:36.680] 除非你正走在离其中一户人家更近的地方。
[00:36:39.580] I guess it, like, depends on which side of the street you're walking on.
[00:36:39.580] 我想，这取决于你走在街道的哪一边。
[00:36:43.140] I guess sometimes in our neighborhood I could still smell barbecues.
[00:36:43.140] 我想有时候在我们这片街区还能闻到烧烤的味道。
[00:36:46.760] Yes.
[00:36:46.760] 是的。
[00:36:47.080] Like, if someone is grilling stuff, that is definitely something that wafts over.
[00:36:47.080] 比如，如果有人在烤东西，那味道肯定会飘过来。
[00:36:50.580] But, yeah, another thing I just remembered is, like, seeing the same neighbors over and over again in the apartment gym.
[00:36:50.580] 但是，对了，我刚刚想起另一件事，就是在公寓健身房里总是看到同样的邻居。
[00:36:56.520] But, like, never saying hi still.
[00:36:56.520] 但是，就像，他们还是从来不打招呼。
[00:36:58.420] Okay, yeah, that's a good one.
[00:36:58.420] 好的，没错，这确实是个好主意。
[00:36:59.980] Yeah, it's actually funny how, like, in apartment buildings it's actually more private in some ways.
[00:36:59.980] 是啊，其实挺有意思的，比如，在公寓楼里，某些方面反而更私密。
[00:37:06.240] Because, like, if they have a parking garage, you don't know which car they even own, most likely.
[00:37:06.240] 因为，比如说，如果他们有停车场，你很可能根本不知道他们拥有哪辆车。
[00:37:12.900] The parking spot numbers don't always correspond with the, like, apartment number.
[00:37:12.900] 停车位编号并不总是与公寓号码等信息相符。
[00:37:17.900] And there's no windows in the hallway where all the doors are.
[00:37:17.900] 走廊里没有窗户，只有门。
[00:37:21.980] So you can never, like, peer into other people's homes the way you can on a residential street.
[00:37:21.980] 所以你永远无法像在居民区街道上那样窥视别人的家。
[00:37:28.100] Oh, my God.
[00:37:28.100] 我的天啊。
[00:37:28.760] So true.
[00:37:28.760] 如此真实。
[00:37:30.200] I feel like the only thing you could really do is, I know some people decorate their, like, apartment front door a little bit for Halloween or, like, holidays and whatnot.
[00:37:30.200] 我觉得你唯一能做的就是，我知道有些人会在万圣节或者其他节日的时候稍微装饰一下他们的公寓前门之类的。
[00:37:40.040] Or your doormat might have a little bit of flair to it.
[00:37:40.040] 或者你的门垫可能有点特别之处。
[00:37:43.420] But really, other than that, it's just so anonymous.
[00:37:43.420] 但除此之外，它真的太匿名了。
[00:37:45.960] Yeah, I think, like, it's a lot more common to not know what your neighbors even look like in a big apartment building.
[00:37:45.960] 是的，我觉得，在大型公寓楼里，不知道邻居长什么样是很常见的。
[00:37:53.580] Yeah.
[00:37:53.580] 是的。
[00:37:54.080] You just might never bump into them.
[00:37:54.080] 你可能永远都不会遇到他们。
[00:37:55.900] Or maybe you do bump into them, but, like, you don't know that they're your neighbor.
[00:37:55.900] 或者你可能碰巧遇到他们，但你并不知道他们是你的邻居。
[00:38:00.400] True, true.
[00:38:00.400] 没错，没错。
[00:38:01.760] I remember when James and I used to live in apartment complexes, we would always try to speculate, like, who lived where.
[00:38:01.760] 我记得以前我和詹姆斯住在公寓楼里的时候，我们总是会猜测，比如，谁住在哪里。
[00:38:09.060] Oh.
[00:38:09.060] 哦。
[00:38:09.660] Because, like you said, unless you're literally bumping into each other, like, as you're both turning your key into your door, like, you just don't know.
[00:38:09.660] 因为就像你说的，除非你们真的碰巧撞到一起，比如你们同时用钥匙开门的时候，否则你根本不知道。
[00:38:16.560] So we would always try to suss out, like, who lived where.
[00:38:16.560] 所以我们总是会想方设法弄清楚，比如，谁住在哪里。
[00:38:20.800] The other funny thing, too, is, like, sometimes you can kind of tell if your upstairs neighbor is moving or not.
[00:38:20.800] 还有一件很有趣的事，就是有时候你能感觉到楼上的邻居是不是要搬家了。
[00:38:26.720] Oh, right.
[00:38:26.720] 哦，对。
[00:38:27.220] Or, like, if they're, like, there or if the apartment is vacant.
[00:38:27.220] 或者，比如，如果他们在那里，或者公寓是空着的。
[00:38:30.360] So, like, we would always try to, like, guess that.
[00:38:30.360] 所以，我们总是会尝试去猜测。
[00:38:33.860] And you could be guessing for the rest of your life.
[00:38:33.860] 你可能一辈子都只能靠猜测。
[00:38:36.360] Yeah, literally.
[00:38:36.360] 没错，就是这样。
[00:38:37.960] Like, I think in New York, I've stayed at our friend Mel's place a couple times, and I still don't know what, like, any of her neighbors look like.
[00:38:37.960] 比如，我觉得在纽约，我曾在朋友梅尔家住过几次，但我仍然不知道她的邻居长什么样。
[00:38:44.960] In fact, I have never met anyone from her floor.
[00:38:44.960] 事实上，我从来没见过她那一层楼的任何人。
[00:38:49.120] I'm just like, dude, how is this possible?
[00:38:49.120] 我当时就想，老兄，这怎么可能？
[00:38:52.640] I know there was a time where James and I lived in this one apartment building, and I think because it was kind of on the newer end, it just never felt like we were bumping into anyone.
[00:38:52.640] 我知道我和詹姆斯曾经住在一栋公寓楼里，我想是因为它算是比较新的，所以我们从来没有碰到过其他人。
[00:39:03.040] And when you would walk through the hallway, it would, for the most part, be silent, too.
[00:39:03.040] 当你走过走廊时，大部分时间里也都是一片寂静。
[00:39:07.800] And I was just like, I think it's just you and me living in this entire building.
[00:39:07.800] 我当时就想，我觉得这栋楼里就只有你和我两个人住。
[00:39:11.820] Oh, my God.
[00:39:11.820] 我的天啊。
[00:39:14.240] That's so funny.
[00:39:14.240] 太搞笑了。
[00:39:15.560] But I do want to bring up one thing that I think could be an exciting thing for our future.
[00:39:15.560] 但我确实想提出一件事，我认为这可能会对我们的未来产生令人兴奋的影响。
[00:39:21.600] Instead of having anonymous neighbors, in the future, we could all totally decide to live next to each other.
[00:39:21.600] 未来，我们不再需要素不相识的邻居，而是可以完全自主地选择住在彼此旁边。
[00:39:28.720] Like, a bunch of our friends could be like, hey, let's all buy these homes in this one cul-de-sac and be each other's neighbors.
[00:39:28.720] 比如，我们的一群朋友可能会说，嘿，咱们都在这条死胡同里买房子，做彼此的邻居吧。
[00:39:35.600] Wouldn't that be so cool?
[00:39:35.600] 那岂不是很酷吗？
[00:39:37.190] Yeah, honestly, that would be huge.
[00:39:37.190] 是啊，说真的，那意义重大。
[00:39:40.060] And we could, well, if we have kids or like all have pets, for example, like we could all go on walks together or like take our kids to school together.
[00:39:40.060] 例如，如果我们都有孩子或者都有宠物，我们就可以一起散步，或者一起送孩子上学。
[00:39:48.920] There's just so many benefits that come from having your friends as neighbors.
[00:39:48.920] 和朋友做邻居的好处实在太多了。
[00:39:52.880] Yeah, and we could have block parties because we're all like just good friends.
[00:39:52.880] 是啊，我们可以举办街区派对，因为我们都是好朋友。
[00:39:57.900] True, true, true.
[00:39:57.900] 没错，没错，没错。
[00:39:59.560] Damn, that would be the dream.
[00:39:59.560] 天哪，那简直就是梦想成真了。
[00:40:01.060] Like, I feel like we wouldn't necessarily even have to be next door neighbors.
[00:40:01.060] 我觉得我们甚至不一定非得是邻居。
[00:40:03.840] Like, if we just live maybe a couple minutes from each other, that would make a world of a difference.
[00:40:03.840] 如果我们住的地方离彼此只有几分钟的路程，那将会带来天翻地覆的变化。
[00:40:08.680] Yeah, like walkable distance.
[00:40:08.680] 对，步行就能到。
[00:40:10.260] We could just walk down the block and be like, hey, can we watch Sunday night football together?
[00:40:10.260] 我们可以直接走到街区尽头，然后说：“嘿，我们能一起看周日晚上的橄榄球赛吗？”
[00:40:17.660] Or if I was feeling lonely and like didn't feel a sense of community, I'd be like, hey, can you guys open your blinds and like turn your lights on inside?
[00:40:17.660] 或者，如果我感到孤独，感觉不到社区的归属感，我就会说，嘿，你们能把百叶窗打开，把里面的灯打开吗？
[00:40:25.860] You're like, I need to know what you're doing right now.
[00:40:25.860] 你会想，我一定要知道你现在在做什么。
[00:40:28.420] Yeah.
[00:40:28.420] 是的。
[00:40:30.000] Like, I see you guys are cooking this kind of food today.
[00:40:30.000] 我看到你们今天在做这种菜。
[00:40:34.360] This actually does kind of remind me of college time because there was an area around UCSD where a lot of students lived.
[00:40:34.360] 这确实让我想起了大学时光，因为加州大学圣地亚哥分校附近有很多学生居住。
[00:40:43.760] These were kind of like townhomes or like condos that a lot of students ended up living in.
[00:40:43.760] 这些房子有点像联排别墅或公寓，很多学生最终都住在那里。
[00:40:48.820] And these neighborhoods were really close to each other.
[00:40:48.820] 而且这些街区彼此距离很近。
[00:40:51.920] So I remember a couple of my friends lived just like up the hill.
[00:40:51.920] 我记得我的几个朋友就住在山坡上。
[00:40:56.040] So it was like maybe two minutes walk.
[00:40:56.040] 所以大概步行两分钟就到了。
[00:40:58.320] So sometimes if all of my friends' roommates were out, then she'd be like, hey, Crystal, I want to come hang out?
[00:40:58.320] 所以有时候如果我所有朋友的室友都不在，她就会说，嘿，Crystal，我想来你这儿玩？
[00:41:04.460] Okay, like I'll just walk over in a couple of minutes.
[00:41:04.460] 好的，我过几分钟就过去。
[00:41:06.860] And I think that accessibility just felt really nice and also helped build the friendship more too.
[00:41:06.860] 我觉得这种便利性让人感觉非常好，也有助于增进友谊。
[00:41:13.600] Oh my God.
[00:41:13.600] 我的天啊。
[00:41:14.280] Is that where you got your idea of like all of us buying houses in the same cul-de-sac and being neighbors?
[00:41:14.280] 你是不是就是从那里得到“我们都在同一条死胡同里买房子，成为邻居”这种想法的？
[00:41:20.300] Oh my God.
[00:41:20.300] 我的天啊。
[00:41:21.500] Actually, no.
[00:41:21.500] 实际上，并非如此。
[00:41:22.460] I got that idea when the last time a bunch of us went to your place and then I was like, oh my God, their neighbor's home is like for sale.
[00:41:22.460] 上次我们一群人去你家的时候，我突然想到，我的天哪，他们邻居的房子好像要出售了。
[00:41:31.160] Like should one of us buy it?
[00:41:31.160] 我们之中谁该买？
[00:41:35.160] Very true, actually.
[00:41:35.160] 确实如此。
[00:41:36.920] I also love how we spent so much of this episode being like, oh, I don't know if we want to be that close to our neighbors.
[00:41:36.920] 我也很喜欢这一集里我们花了很多时间讨论“哦，我不知道我们是否想和邻居住得那么近”这个问题。
[00:41:44.040] And we're just like, oh, actually, we'll just have our friends be our neighbors.
[00:41:44.040] 于是我们就想，哦，其实，我们就让朋友们做我们的邻居吧。
[00:41:48.840] Yeah, it's the ultimate solution.
[00:41:48.840] 没错，这是最终解决方案。
[00:41:50.900] Like why would we even let our neighbors be up to chance when it could just be us?
[00:41:50.900] 既然我们可以自己承担风险，为什么还要让邻居碰运气呢？
[00:41:57.260] Yeah, why befriend your neighbors when you can just all coordinate home buying together?
[00:41:57.260] 是啊，既然可以一起买房，为什么还要和邻居交朋友呢？
[00:42:03.840] Honestly, I am fully on board with this plan.
[00:42:03.840] 说实话，我完全赞同这个计划。
[00:42:06.940] It's like friends, but in the suburbs.
[00:42:06.940] 就像《老友记》一样，只不过是在郊区。
[00:42:11.040] Bay Area version of friends.
[00:42:11.040] 湾区版的《老友记》。
[00:42:12.720] Yeah.
[00:42:12.720] 是的。
[00:42:14.600] Yeah, but all in all, I think what we've learned is befriending your neighbors ultimately have more pros than cons.
[00:42:14.600] 是的，但总的来说，我认为我们学到的是，与邻居交朋友最终利大于弊。
[00:42:21.760] So I think this is something that I will think a little bit more about and try to be braver about.
[00:42:21.760] 所以我觉得这件事我需要再多考虑一下，并且要更勇敢一些。
[00:42:28.080] This episode is like inspo for ourselves.
[00:42:28.080] 这一集就像是给我们自己带来的灵感。
[00:42:30.800] Yeah.
[00:42:30.800] 是的。
[00:42:31.820] To gather up the courage to talk to our neighbors.
[00:42:31.820] 鼓起勇气和邻居们交谈。
[00:42:34.420] Yeah.
[00:42:34.420] 是的。
