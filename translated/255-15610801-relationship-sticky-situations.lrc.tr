[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_01]：大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是克里斯托。
[00:00:03.160] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:03.160] [SPEAKER_01]：我是 Jeesoo。
[00:00:04.340] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm Eugene.
[00:00:04.340] [SPEAKER_00]：我是尤金。
[00:00:16.490] [SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, Eugene.
[00:00:16.490] [SPEAKER_03]：欢迎回来，尤金。
[00:00:18.350] [SPEAKER_03]: Last time you were on the podcast with us was episode 193, Hinge Profiles and First Dates.
[00:00:18.350] [SPEAKER_03]：你上次和我们一起参加播客节目是第 193 集，主题是 Hinge 个人资料和第一次约会。
[00:00:24.830] [SPEAKER_03]: And today we're super excited to have you on because we have a kind of spicy array of questions to discuss.
[00:00:24.830] [SPEAKER_03]：今天我们非常高兴能邀请到您，因为我们有一系列非常精彩的问题要讨论。
[00:00:32.110] [SPEAKER_03]: So today's episode, we'll dive into any sort of sticky situations regarding our ex,
[00:00:32.110] [SPEAKER_03]：那么在今天的节目中，我们将深入探讨与前任有关的各种棘手情况，
[00:00:38.210] [SPEAKER_03]: our SO or anything in between.
[00:00:38.210] [SPEAKER_03]：我们的另一半，或者介于两者之间的任何关系。
[00:00:41.390] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with an easy one to kind of ease us into the day.
[00:00:41.390] [SPEAKER_03]：让我们先从一个简单的开始，轻松地开启新的一天。
[00:00:45.530] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you bumped into your ex, would you say hi?
[00:00:45.530] [SPEAKER_03]：所以如果你偶遇前任，你会打招呼吗？
[00:00:49.610] [SPEAKER_00]: This happened a few months ago.
[00:00:49.610] [SPEAKER_00]：这件事发生在几个月前。
[00:00:50.910] [SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say hi. Oh, so OK, OK, OK.
[00:00:50.910] [SPEAKER_00]：我没打招呼。哦，好吧，好吧，好吧。
[00:00:55.690] [SPEAKER_00]: What happened was I knew she was going to be somewhere with mutual friends.
[00:00:55.690] [SPEAKER_00]：事情是这样的，我知道她会和我们共同的朋友在一起。
[00:01:00.650] [SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know she was ready.
[00:01:00.650] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道她已经准备好了。
[00:01:03.530] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm ready.
[00:01:03.530] [SPEAKER_00]：我想我准备好了。
[00:01:05.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Who knows? Maybe maybe I wasn't.
[00:01:05.170] [SPEAKER_00]：谁知道呢？也许我不是。
[00:01:06.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know. But like we were at the bar and I saw one of her friends.
[00:01:06.690] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道。但当时我们在酒吧，我看到了她的一个朋友。
[00:01:10.370] [SPEAKER_00]: I said hi and I saw her like on the other side.
[00:01:10.370] [SPEAKER_00]：我跟她打了声招呼，然后我看到她在另一边。
[00:01:13.890] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, I'm going to pretend we didn't see each other,
[00:01:13.890] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我就想，我要假装我们没见过面，
[00:01:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]: you know, because maybe you didn't see me.
[00:01:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，因为你可能没看见我。
[00:01:20.290] [SPEAKER_00]: So in that instance, I didn't say hi, but generally I would.
[00:01:20.290] [SPEAKER_00]：所以当时我没有打招呼，但通常情况下我会打招呼。
[00:01:23.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know. Yeah.
[00:01:23.670] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，你知道的。是啊。
[00:01:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]: I live what I preach.
[00:01:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]：我言行一致。
[00:01:27.670] [SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't, but you would.
[00:01:27.670] [SPEAKER_03]：所以你没有，但你会。
[00:01:32.210] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like it depends on so much, right?
[00:01:32.210] [SPEAKER_00]：我的意思是，我觉得这取决于很多因素，对吧？
[00:01:35.190] [SPEAKER_00]: How ready you are, how ready they are.
[00:01:35.190] [SPEAKER_00]：你们准备好了多少，他们准备好了多少。
[00:01:37.650] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I try to at least keep be cautious about it and not if it was
[00:01:37.650] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得我至少应该保持谨慎，而不是想着如果……
[00:01:42.470] [SPEAKER_00]: like a bad breakup or if it was like there's still some feelings or like
[00:01:42.470] [SPEAKER_00]：就像糟糕的分手，或者就像仍然有些感情纠葛，或者像
[00:01:46.530] [SPEAKER_00]: whatever in this on both sides, and probably best not to.
[00:01:46.530] [SPEAKER_00]：不管双方怎么想，最好还是不要这么做。
[00:01:50.230] [SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess that's fair.
[00:01:50.230] [SPEAKER_01]：不过，我想这很公平。
[00:01:52.710] [SPEAKER_01]: The key being like if you feel ready to say hi.
[00:01:52.710] [SPEAKER_01]：关键在于你是否准备好打招呼。
[00:01:55.750] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[00:01:55.750] [SPEAKER_00]：嗯，我想是的。
[00:01:57.430] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you guys do in the past?
[00:01:57.430] [SPEAKER_00]：我的意思是，你们过去都做些什么？
[00:02:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I think I am fine with saying hi.
[00:02:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]：说实话，我觉得打个招呼就挺好的。
[00:02:03.450] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just it's sometimes too
[00:02:03.450] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得有时候太过了。
[00:02:05.270] [SPEAKER_01]: awkward if you've clearly seen each other and you're just ignoring them.
[00:02:05.270] [SPEAKER_01]：明明彼此都看到了对方，却故意无视对方，这很尴尬。
[00:02:10.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Like there's there's just like awkward tension that would build up.
[00:02:10.110] [SPEAKER_01]：就像会有一种尴尬的紧张气氛逐渐累积起来。
[00:02:13.570] [SPEAKER_01]: So I would probably just end up saying hi.
[00:02:13.570] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我可能最后只会说声嗨。
[00:02:16.550] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it breaks the ice a bit where it's like I have nothing against
[00:02:16.550] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得这多少能打破僵局，让人觉得我并没有什么反对意见。
[00:02:20.170] [SPEAKER_01]: you. We can say hi to each other.
[00:02:20.170] [SPEAKER_01]：你。我们可以互相打个招呼。
[00:02:22.090] [SPEAKER_00]: What do you say after you say hi?
[00:02:22.090] [SPEAKER_00]：打完招呼后你会说什么？
[00:02:23.750] [SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the situation.
[00:02:23.750] [SPEAKER_01]：这要视情况而定。
[00:02:25.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Like where are you?
[00:02:25.110] [SPEAKER_01]：你在哪里？
[00:02:26.690] [SPEAKER_01]: Like crazy seeing you here.
[00:02:26.690] [SPEAKER_01]：见到你真是太不可思议了。
[00:02:28.210] [SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[00:02:28.210] [SPEAKER_01]：你好吗？
[00:02:29.410] [SPEAKER_01]: And then quickly walk away, I guess.
[00:02:29.410] [SPEAKER_01]：然后就迅速走开了，我想。
[00:02:32.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. How's life been?
[00:02:32.730] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。最近过得怎么样？
[00:02:33.910] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right. Yeah.
[00:02:33.910] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，对。是的。
[00:02:35.990] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I actually did bump into an ex before.
[00:02:35.990] [SPEAKER_01]：我的意思是，我之前确实偶遇过前任。
[00:02:39.450] [SPEAKER_01]: There were like a couple of times one time was at a party and it was like
[00:02:39.450] [SPEAKER_01]：大概有那么几次，有一次是在一个聚会上，当时的情况是……
[00:02:44.250] [SPEAKER_01]: kind of awkward because we clearly both saw each other, but no one made the
[00:02:44.250] [SPEAKER_01]：有点尴尬，因为我们俩明明都看到了对方，但没人说……
[00:02:49.270] [SPEAKER_01]: move to say hi. It went on for so long that I just
[00:02:49.270] [SPEAKER_01]：我过去打招呼。事情持续了太久，我简直……
[00:02:52.410] [SPEAKER_01]: felt so uncomfortable that I was like, OK, if this guy's not going to break the
[00:02:52.410] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉很不自在，我就想，好吧，如果这家伙不打算打破……
[00:02:56.110] [SPEAKER_01]: ice and I will I'll just say hi.
[00:02:56.110] [SPEAKER_01]: ice 和我，我就说声嗨。
[00:02:58.410] [SPEAKER_01]: I tried to make a joke out of it.
[00:02:58.410] [SPEAKER_01]：我试图拿这件事开玩笑。
[00:03:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hi.
[00:03:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]：我当时就说，嗨。
[00:03:01.790] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, what did I say?
[00:03:01.790] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，等等，我刚才说什么了？
[00:03:03.510] [SPEAKER_00]: Close the joke.
[00:03:03.510] [SPEAKER_00]：结束这个笑话。
[00:03:04.210] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like you're not going to say hi.
[00:03:04.210] [SPEAKER_03]：你好像连招呼都不打。
[00:03:08.670] [SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we just like chatted for a bit and it was pretty
[00:03:08.670] [SPEAKER_01]：然后之后，我们就聊了一会儿，感觉挺不错的。
[00:03:12.910] [SPEAKER_03]: chill. See, I feel like that's like the
[00:03:12.910] [SPEAKER_03]：冷静点。你看，我觉得这就像是……
[00:03:14.890] [SPEAKER_03]: respectable thing to do, and it's what I wish I could do.
[00:03:14.890] [SPEAKER_03]：这是件值得尊敬的事，也是我希望自己能做的事。
[00:03:19.090] [SPEAKER_03]: But every time I've seen my exes, I've always either run away or like
[00:03:19.090] [SPEAKER_03]：但每次我见到前任，我总是要么逃跑，要么……
[00:03:25.210] [SPEAKER_03]: kind of awkwardly coexist near them if it's like a party and it's unavoidable.
[00:03:25.210] [SPEAKER_03]：如果是在聚会上，无法避免，那就只能尴尬地和他们待在一起了。
[00:03:29.870] [SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be really crazy and double standardy.
[00:03:29.870] [SPEAKER_03]：这简直太疯狂了，而且是双重标准。
[00:03:32.850] [SPEAKER_03]: So don't come for me.
[00:03:32.850] [SPEAKER_03]：所以别来找我麻烦。
[00:03:34.570] [SPEAKER_03]: But even though I don't have the balls to say hi, I sometimes judge
[00:03:34.570] [SPEAKER_03]：虽然我没胆子打招呼，但我有时也会评判别人。
[00:03:38.830] [SPEAKER_03]: my ex for not coming up and saying hi.
[00:03:38.830] [SPEAKER_03]：因为我的前任没有走过来跟我打招呼。
[00:03:41.930] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the courage to do it, but you also don't have the courage to do it.
[00:03:41.930] [SPEAKER_03]：我没有勇气去做，但你也没有勇气去做。
[00:03:45.910] [SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[00:03:45.910] [SPEAKER_03]：太疯狂了。
[00:03:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like I don't do it.
[00:03:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我好像没做过。
[00:03:49.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever. But you like, I thought I thought you were better than that.
[00:03:49.250] [SPEAKER_00]：我的意思是，随便吧。但是，我以为你比这更有风度。
[00:03:54.010] [SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[00:03:54.010] [SPEAKER_00]：我明白了。
[00:03:55.650] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like, I don't know.
[00:03:55.650] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我也不知道。
[00:03:57.850] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you want to be the bigger person and you want to be like, oh,
[00:03:57.850] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得你想表现得宽容大度，你想说，哦，
[00:04:01.650] [SPEAKER_00]: I am comfortable saying hi because I'm winning in life or whatever.
[00:04:01.650] [SPEAKER_00]：我之所以能轻松地打招呼，是因为我在生活中取得了成功，或者其他什么原因。
[00:04:06.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Compared to your ex.
[00:04:06.110] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。跟你前任比起来。
[00:04:07.810] [SPEAKER_00]: That's like the main thought that goes to my head where it's like,
[00:04:07.810] [SPEAKER_00]：我脑子里主要想的就是这个，就像是，
[00:04:10.130] [SPEAKER_00]: at the very least, I have to act super chill and like nothing.
[00:04:10.130] [SPEAKER_00]：至少，我必须表现得超级冷静，好像什么事都没发生一样。
[00:04:14.150] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm unfazed.
[00:04:14.150] [SPEAKER_00]：我毫不在意。
[00:04:15.070] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm very demure and shit, you know?
[00:04:15.070] [SPEAKER_00]：我性格很内向，你知道吗？
[00:04:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]: But whether that involves saying hi, it depends on them too, in a way.
[00:04:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]：但是否要打招呼，某种程度上也取决于他们自己。
[00:04:22.870] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know. I mean, maybe it's different for you guys, but like, OK,
[00:04:22.870] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道。我的意思是，也许对你们来说情况不一样，但是，好吧，
[00:04:25.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that has broken up with most of my exes.
[00:04:25.690] [SPEAKER_00]：我跟大多数前任都分手了。
[00:04:29.450] [SPEAKER_00]: So I always feel like the more guilty one.
[00:04:29.450] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我总觉得自己是更内疚的那一个。
[00:04:33.210] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not up to me whether you want me to say hi type of stuff.
[00:04:33.210] [SPEAKER_00]：你是否希望我打招呼之类的，这不是我能决定的。
[00:04:36.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.
[00:04:36.570] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，有意思。
[00:04:37.650] [SPEAKER_03]: So does this mean there's a little bit of fear of rejection involved where
[00:04:37.650] [SPEAKER_03]：所以这是否意味着其中存在一些被拒绝的恐惧？
[00:04:41.490] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe you feel like you're over it and you're good and you want to reach
[00:04:41.490] [SPEAKER_03]：也许你觉得你已经走出来了，你感觉很好，你想达到……
[00:04:44.710] [SPEAKER_03]: out and say hi, but what if they are still going through shit or there's
[00:04:44.710] [SPEAKER_03]：出去打个招呼，但如果他们还在经历糟糕的事情，或者还有其他什么情况呢？
[00:04:48.470] [SPEAKER_03]: something unresolved there and they might not want to actively interact with you?
[00:04:48.470] [SPEAKER_03]：那里有些问题尚未解决，他们可能不想主动与你互动？
[00:04:52.790] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never thought about it as fear of rejection.
[00:04:52.790] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我从来没想过这是害怕被拒绝。
[00:04:55.670] [SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely that to an extent.
[00:04:55.670] [SPEAKER_00]：但在某种程度上确实如此。
[00:04:57.610] [SPEAKER_00]: It's also definitely a feeling of like, oh,
[00:04:57.610] [SPEAKER_00]：这绝对也是一种感觉，哦，
[00:05:00.390] [SPEAKER_00]: if I'm the one who broke up with you, then you are the one that has to
[00:05:00.390] [SPEAKER_00]：如果是我提出分手，那么你就必须……
[00:05:04.130] [SPEAKER_00]: react to it and then, like, you know, respond to it, build your own life
[00:05:04.130] [SPEAKER_00]：对它做出反应，然后，你知道，回应它，建立你自己的生活
[00:05:07.810] [SPEAKER_00]: up, do your own thing, whatever.
[00:05:07.810] [SPEAKER_00]:起来，做你自己的事，随便什么都行。
[00:05:09.370] [SPEAKER_00]: So like, I don't want to impede on that, I guess.
[00:05:09.370] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，我不想妨碍这件事，我想。
[00:05:12.810] [SPEAKER_00]: But yes, also fear of rejection because I say hi to like, it was an
[00:05:12.810] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，是的，我也害怕被拒绝，因为我跟别人打招呼，就像……
[00:05:16.410] [SPEAKER_00]: autonomy growing.
[00:05:16.410] [SPEAKER_00]：自主性正在增强。
[00:05:18.790] [SPEAKER_01]: Wow. Wow.
[00:05:18.790] [SPEAKER_01]：哇。哇。
[00:05:19.750] [SPEAKER_01]: Wait, but then even if you're the person who broke up with the other person,
[00:05:19.750] [SPEAKER_01]：等等，但即便你是提出分手的那一方，
[00:05:23.490] [SPEAKER_01]: don't you feel like you still also have to go through exactly what you said?
[00:05:23.490] [SPEAKER_01]：你不觉得你仍然需要经历你刚才所说的那些事情吗？
[00:05:27.270] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, rebuild.
[00:05:27.270] [SPEAKER_01]：就像，你知道的，重建。
[00:05:28.710] [SPEAKER_00]: You're okay.
[00:05:28.710] [SPEAKER_00]：你没事吧。
[00:05:30.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[00:05:30.170] [SPEAKER_00]：完全不是。
[00:05:31.310] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm super chill.
[00:05:31.310] [SPEAKER_00]：我超级放松。
[00:05:32.150] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[00:05:32.150] [SPEAKER_00]：好吧。
[00:05:32.790] [SPEAKER_00]: The way I think about it is if I'm breaking up with them,
[00:05:32.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我的想法是，如果我要和他们分手，
[00:05:36.370] [SPEAKER_00]: if I'm deciding before they do and it's not mutual, then I already kind
[00:05:36.370] [SPEAKER_00]：如果我在他们之前做出决定，而且这并非双方共同的决定，那么我已经有点……
[00:05:40.370] [SPEAKER_00]: of went through that process a bit.
[00:05:40.370] [SPEAKER_00]：我经历过这个过程。
[00:05:42.010] [SPEAKER_01]: I see like you had a head start, like you were mentally prepared for it.
[00:05:42.010] [SPEAKER_01]：我看得出来你已经占了先机，好像你已经做好了心理准备。
[00:05:45.730] [SPEAKER_00]: I did have a head start.
[00:05:45.730] [SPEAKER_00]：我的确有先机。
[00:05:46.710] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:05:46.710] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:05:47.910] [SPEAKER_01]: I think beyond all of that, though, isn't it just like really awkward if
[00:05:47.910] [SPEAKER_01]：不过，我觉得抛开所有这些不谈，如果……那岂不是很尴尬吗？
[00:05:52.110] [SPEAKER_01]: you see your ex, you both see each other and you just ignore each other?
[00:05:52.110] [SPEAKER_01]：你见到你的前任，你们俩都看到了对方，但你们都选择无视对方？
[00:05:57.370] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like almost rude, right?
[00:05:57.370] [SPEAKER_01]：这简直太没礼貌了，对吧？
[00:06:00.570] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little on who?
[00:06:00.570] [SPEAKER_00]：这有点像是谁？
[00:06:02.590] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, OK, think about it this way.
[00:06:02.590] [SPEAKER_01]：我的意思是，好吧，换个角度想。
[00:06:04.310] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess, like in specific situations, it can feel kind of rude or weird.
[00:06:04.310] [SPEAKER_01]：我想，在某些特定情况下，这样做可能会让人感觉有点粗鲁或奇怪。
[00:06:08.730] [SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you bump into them at like a party and then you're in a circle
[00:06:08.730] [SPEAKER_01]：假设你在聚会上碰到了他们，然后你们围成一圈……
[00:06:13.970] [SPEAKER_01]: chatting with everyone, you're just completely ignoring one person
[00:06:13.970] [SPEAKER_01]：你跟每个人都聊天，却完全忽略了一个人。
[00:06:17.530] [SPEAKER_01]: in that circle because they're your ex.
[00:06:17.530] [SPEAKER_01]：在那个圈子里，因为他们是你的前任。
[00:06:20.030] [SPEAKER_03]: It is rude, but there's ways to tiptoe around it to make it not awkward or
[00:06:20.030] [SPEAKER_03]：这很无礼，但有一些方法可以委婉地处理，避免尴尬或不妥。
[00:06:25.570] [SPEAKER_03]: obvious because if you're having a group conversation, you can respond
[00:06:25.570] [SPEAKER_03]：很明显，因为如果你在进行群组对话，你可以回复
[00:06:30.350] [SPEAKER_03]: to or react to someone saying something without actively engaging
[00:06:30.350] [SPEAKER_03]：对某人说的话做出反应，但不主动参与。
[00:06:34.590] [SPEAKER_03]: in it or even addressing them.
[00:06:34.590] [SPEAKER_03]：在其中，甚至向他们讲话。
[00:06:36.270] [SPEAKER_03]: So, for example, if we were in a group and my ex said something that was funny,
[00:06:36.270] [SPEAKER_03]：例如，如果我们在一个团体里，我的前任说了些好笑的话，
[00:06:40.270] [SPEAKER_03]: I would be like, oh, ha ha.
[00:06:40.270] [SPEAKER_03]：我会说，哦，哈哈。
[00:06:41.970] [SPEAKER_03]: And I can even add my joke on top, but I don't have to say his name or be
[00:06:41.970] [SPEAKER_03]：我甚至可以在上面加个笑话，但我不必说出他的名字，也不必……
[00:06:46.710] [SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, that was a great joke so and so.
[00:06:46.710] [SPEAKER_03]：比如，哦，那真是个很棒的笑话，某某。
[00:06:49.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Because why would you?
[00:06:49.190] [SPEAKER_00]：因为你为什么要这么做？
[00:06:51.330] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see.
[00:06:51.330] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，我明白了。
[00:06:52.050] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's like acknowledging, but not.
[00:06:52.050] [SPEAKER_01]：所以这就像是承认，但又不是承认。
[00:06:55.310] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[00:06:55.310] [SPEAKER_01]：是的。
[00:06:56.230] [SPEAKER_00]: My strat is if I went to my ex at a party or a gathering,
[00:06:56.230] [SPEAKER_00]：我的策略是，如果我在聚会或集会上遇到我的前任，
[00:07:00.590] [SPEAKER_00]: when I'm doing my rounds, I will also say hi to them.
[00:07:00.590] [SPEAKER_00]：当我巡视的时候，我也会向他们问好。
[00:07:03.690] [SPEAKER_00]: But I got to move on as other people say hi to.
[00:07:03.690] [SPEAKER_00]：但我得继续前进，因为其他人也向我问好。
[00:07:06.150] [SPEAKER_00]: But then I already did my job.
[00:07:06.150] [SPEAKER_00]：但我已经完成我的工作了。
[00:07:07.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I made my presence known and now I will not talk to you for the rest of the night.
[00:07:07.830] [SPEAKER_00]：我已经表明了我的存在，今晚我不会再跟你说话了。
[00:07:12.070] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's chill.
[00:07:12.070] [SPEAKER_00]：而且很轻松。
[00:07:13.290] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I think that's totally fair because you acknowledged them at least once.
[00:07:13.290] [SPEAKER_01]：好的，我认为这完全公平，因为你至少承认过他们一次。
[00:07:17.210] [SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, no one said you had to keep talking to them.
[00:07:17.210] [SPEAKER_01]：然后，从那以后，没有人说你必须继续和他们交谈。
[00:07:21.970] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:07:21.970] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:07:22.410] [SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a situation where two people are exes and they just don't
[00:07:22.410] [SPEAKER_00]：我从未见过两个前任在一起却又分手的情况。
[00:07:25.930] [SPEAKER_00]: even acknowledge ever.
[00:07:25.930] [SPEAKER_00]：甚至从未承认过。
[00:07:28.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, and they're in the same room.
[00:07:28.330] [SPEAKER_00]：就像，而且他们就在同一个房间里。
[00:07:30.350] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. That's kind of crazy.
[00:07:30.350] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。这有点疯狂。
[00:07:31.410] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:07:31.410] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。
[00:07:32.170] [SPEAKER_01]: I will admit I've seen that before.
[00:07:32.170] [SPEAKER_01]：我承认我以前见过这种情况。
[00:07:36.270] [SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[00:07:36.270] [SPEAKER_00]：你是做什么的？
[00:07:37.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Stand in the middle like, well, how do you guys know each other?
[00:07:37.170] [SPEAKER_00]: 站在中间，就好像在说，你们是怎么认识的？
[00:07:41.950] [SPEAKER_01]: It's unique.
[00:07:41.950] [SPEAKER_01]：它是独一无二的。
[00:07:43.410] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, at least when I've seen it, everyone in the room knows.
[00:07:43.410] [SPEAKER_01]：有时候，至少在我见过的情况下，房间里的每个人都知道。
[00:07:46.590] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's less awkward.
[00:07:46.590] [SPEAKER_01]：这样就不那么尴尬了。
[00:07:48.890] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think if no one in the room knows, it's definitely more awkward.
[00:07:48.890] [SPEAKER_01]：但我认为如果房间里没有人知道，那肯定会更尴尬。
[00:07:52.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, is it just me or do these people have really bad energy?
[00:07:52.470] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，是不是只有我一个人觉得这些人浑身散发着不好的气息？
[00:07:57.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the thing, too.
[00:07:57.370] [SPEAKER_03]：嗯，也是这个问题。
[00:07:58.890] [SPEAKER_03]: If everyone in the room knows,
[00:07:58.890] [SPEAKER_03]：如果房间里的每个人都知道，
[00:08:01.550] [SPEAKER_03]: then when you make your rounds and say hi to people,
[00:08:01.550] [SPEAKER_03]：然后当你四处走动，和人们打招呼时，
[00:08:04.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's audience mode.
[00:08:04.730] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得现在是观众模式。
[00:08:07.170] [SPEAKER_03]: So you say hi to everyone and then you get to your ex and everyone is just
[00:08:07.170] [SPEAKER_03]：所以你跟每个人都打招呼，然后轮到你前任的时候，大家都……
[00:08:10.890] [SPEAKER_03]: staring at you or even if they aren't, it just feels like that mentally.
[00:08:10.890] [SPEAKER_03]：即使他们没有盯着你看，你的心理也会有这种感觉。
[00:08:15.330] [SPEAKER_03]: So then I feel like it adds to the pressure of, do I even want to say hi
[00:08:15.330] [SPEAKER_03]：所以我觉得这反而增加了压力，让我纠结到底要不要打招呼。
[00:08:18.570] [SPEAKER_03]: or should I just be like, oh, gonna go chat the person right next
[00:08:18.570] [SPEAKER_03]：或者我应该直接说，哦，我要去和旁边那个人聊聊？
[00:08:22.570] [SPEAKER_03]: to the ex up for 20 minutes now?
[00:08:22.570] [SPEAKER_03]：跟前任聊了20分钟了？
[00:08:25.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Wait, so you would watch Jisoo?
[00:08:25.710] [SPEAKER_01]：等等，所以你会看Jisoo？
[00:08:27.130] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I would turn away from secondhand embarrassment.
[00:08:27.130] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得我会避开别人替我感到尴尬的情况。
[00:08:30.510] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I am not above being a spectator.
[00:08:30.510] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，我并不排斥当旁观者。
[00:08:34.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah. Dude, it's so fascinating.
[00:08:34.730] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，是啊。老兄，这太迷人了。
[00:08:39.210] [SPEAKER_00]: Like two animals in the wild.
[00:08:39.210] [SPEAKER_00]：就像两只野生动物。
[00:08:41.570] [SPEAKER_00]: But they're not looking.
[00:08:41.570] [SPEAKER_00]：但他们没在看。
[00:08:43.070] [SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through this kind of but like
[00:08:43.070] [SPEAKER_00]：我经历过这种感觉，但是就像
[00:08:44.890] [SPEAKER_00]: through texts where my college group, me and my ex were both in it.
[00:08:44.890] [SPEAKER_00]：通过短信，我和我的大学群组、我的前任都在其中。
[00:08:50.510] [SPEAKER_00]: So when we do post-college hangouts,
[00:08:50.510] [SPEAKER_00]：所以当我们进行大学毕业后的聚会时，
[00:08:53.770] [SPEAKER_00]: it's like a game of who replies first.
[00:08:53.770] [SPEAKER_00]：这就像一场比谁先回答的游戏。
[00:08:56.210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes, oh, all right,
[00:08:56.210] [SPEAKER_00]：然后就变成了，哦，好吧，
[00:08:57.890] [SPEAKER_00]: it's her hangout now or it's my hangout based on which ex replies first.
[00:08:57.890] [SPEAKER_00]：现在这里是她的聚会场所还是我的聚会场所，取决于哪个前任先回复。
[00:09:02.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I stopped doing that because after a point, I was like, oh, like this is lame.
[00:09:02.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我后来就不这么做了，因为我觉得，哦，这太逊了。
[00:09:07.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to hang out with my friends too.
[00:09:07.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我也想和朋友们一起出去玩。
[00:09:08.770] [SPEAKER_00]: But like for a period,
[00:09:08.770] [SPEAKER_00]：但就像有一段时间一样，
[00:09:10.750] [SPEAKER_00]: everyone in the group kind of assumed or respected that.
[00:09:10.750] [SPEAKER_00]：小组里的每个人都默认或尊重这一点。
[00:09:14.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like, OK, like if my ex said she's down and I haven't responded yet,
[00:09:14.390] [SPEAKER_00]：比如说，好吧，比如说，如果我前任说她有空，但我还没回应，
[00:09:19.810] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably not showing up.
[00:09:19.810] [SPEAKER_00]：我可能不会出席。
[00:09:22.530] [SPEAKER_01]: The silent claim.
[00:09:22.530] [SPEAKER_01]：无声的诉求。
[00:09:26.210] [SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you got it. You got it this round.
[00:09:26.210] [SPEAKER_00]：基本上，你赢了。这轮你赢了。
[00:09:27.970] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll come back stronger next round.
[00:09:27.970] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，下一轮我会更强。
[00:09:29.790] [SPEAKER_00]: But you're quick.
[00:09:29.790] [SPEAKER_00]：但你动作很快。
[00:09:30.590] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like fighting for each hangout.
[00:09:30.590] [SPEAKER_03]：你们就像在争夺每个聚会地点一样。
[00:09:33.530] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like instant responses all the time.
[00:09:33.530] [SPEAKER_03]：就像一直都是即时回复一样。
[00:09:36.610] [SPEAKER_00]: Dude, dude, one time they came back after not seeing us for a year.
[00:09:36.610] [SPEAKER_00]: 兄弟，兄弟，有一次他们一年没见我们之后又回来了。
[00:09:40.530] [SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the people in the group, they're like, oh, everyone,
[00:09:40.530] [SPEAKER_00]：就像团队里的某个人一样，他们会说，哦，每个人，
[00:09:42.710] [SPEAKER_00]: I miss you guys. I haven't seen you guys in so long.
[00:09:42.710] [SPEAKER_00]：我想你们了。好久没见到你们了。
[00:09:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]: And then she replied in five minutes.
[00:09:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]：然后她五分钟后回复了。
[00:09:46.450] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, well, yeah.
[00:09:46.450] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我就想，嗯，嗯，是啊。
[00:09:48.990] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I had to be like, you know what?
[00:09:48.990] [SPEAKER_00]：就在那时，我不得不想，你知道吗？
[00:09:50.790] [SPEAKER_00]: No more of this.
[00:09:50.790] [SPEAKER_00]：够了。
[00:09:52.330] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:52.330] [SPEAKER_00]：好吧，这太荒谬了。
[00:09:54.810] [SPEAKER_03]: There is kind of a weird political divide thing that does happen, though,
[00:09:54.810] [SPEAKER_03]：不过，确实存在一种奇怪的政治分歧现象。
[00:09:58.610] [SPEAKER_03]: especially if you and your ex shared a bunch of different friend groups.
[00:09:58.610] [SPEAKER_03]：尤其是如果你和你的前任有很多共同的朋友圈的话。
[00:10:02.510] [SPEAKER_03]: But I do have a question for you guys.
[00:10:02.510] [SPEAKER_03]：但我确实有个问题想问大家。
[00:10:06.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you be OK if your friend got with one of your exes?
[00:10:06.130] [SPEAKER_03]：如果你的朋友和你的前任在一起了，你会介意吗？
[00:10:10.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I think honestly, this really depends on the ex.
[00:10:10.830] [SPEAKER_01]：说实话，我认为这真的取决于前任。
[00:10:14.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not the friend and maybe the friend too.
[00:10:14.050] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，不是朋友，也可能是朋友。
[00:10:17.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Which is more important, the friend or the ex?
[00:10:17.730] [SPEAKER_00]：朋友和前任，哪个更重要？
[00:10:19.690] [SPEAKER_01]: I think the ex is probably more important at first.
[00:10:19.690] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为前任一开始可能更重要。
[00:10:24.150] [SPEAKER_01]: How long you dated and like, you know, how deep was that relationship?
[00:10:24.150] [SPEAKER_01]：你们交往了多久？你们的关系有多深？
[00:10:27.710] [SPEAKER_01]: If it was like, you know, some random high school ex that you don't really care
[00:10:27.710] [SPEAKER_01]：如果是那种，你知道的，你根本不在乎的某个高中前任呢？
[00:10:31.310] [SPEAKER_01]: about anymore, it really doesn't matter, like no matter who your friend is,
[00:10:31.310] [SPEAKER_01]：至于其他的事，真的都不重要了，不管你的朋友是谁，
[00:10:35.030] [SPEAKER_01]: probably for the most part.
[00:10:35.030] [SPEAKER_01]：大概大部分情况下是这样。
[00:10:37.010] [SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, after that level,
[00:10:37.010] [SPEAKER_01]：然后，你知道，在那之后，
[00:10:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: it would be like, how close are you to that friend?
[00:10:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]：这就好比，你和那个朋友的关系有多亲密？
[00:10:42.470] [SPEAKER_03]: So I guess for ease of the question,
[00:10:42.470] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，为了方便提问，我想，
[00:10:44.690] [SPEAKER_03]: let's say this friend is someone who knows you pretty well and has
[00:10:44.690] [SPEAKER_03]：假设这位朋友很了解你，而且……
[00:10:49.190] [SPEAKER_03]: definitely seen and known that you've dated this guy.
[00:10:49.190] [SPEAKER_03]：我当然知道你和这个人约会过。
[00:10:52.490] [SPEAKER_03]: It's not like she's belatedly like, oh, my God,
[00:10:52.490] [SPEAKER_03]：她并不是事后才恍然大悟，哦，我的天哪，
[00:10:54.510] [SPEAKER_03]: like, I had no idea you dated him.
[00:10:54.510] [SPEAKER_03]：我完全不知道你和他约会过。
[00:10:56.090] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like she knew and you know, she knew.
[00:10:56.090] [SPEAKER_03]：就好像她知道，你知道，她知道。
[00:10:59.850] [SPEAKER_00]: She was there.
[00:10:59.850] [SPEAKER_00]：她当时在那里。
[00:11:01.070] [SPEAKER_00]: She hung out with you guys.
[00:11:01.070] [SPEAKER_00]：她和你们一起玩过。
[00:11:02.270] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still same.
[00:11:02.270] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得还是一样。
[00:11:03.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, it still depends on the relationship and the friendship.
[00:11:03.870] [SPEAKER_01]：这仍然取决于彼此的关系和友谊。
[00:11:07.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you care if she asks for your permission or not?
[00:11:07.830] [SPEAKER_00]：你会在意她是否征求你的同意吗？
[00:11:12.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I OK, I feel like that's such a hard position to be in,
[00:11:12.050] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，好吧，我觉得这真是个很艰难的处境。
[00:11:15.810] [SPEAKER_01]: but I get the intention because like the intention is good, right?
[00:11:15.810] [SPEAKER_01]：但我理解这个意图，因为意图是好的，对吧？
[00:11:19.210] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, I just want to let you know that I know you dated this
[00:11:19.210] [SPEAKER_01]：你会想，哦，我只是想让你知道我知道你和这个人约会过。
[00:11:22.850] [SPEAKER_01]: person and, you know, whatever is happening.
[00:11:22.850] [SPEAKER_01]：人和，你知道，任何正在发生的事情。
[00:11:25.630] [SPEAKER_01]: But then also suddenly what?
[00:11:25.630] [SPEAKER_01]：但是，突然之间又发生了什么？
[00:11:28.450] [SPEAKER_01]: You're the decision maker for their entire relationship.
[00:11:28.450] [SPEAKER_01]：你是他们整个关系中的决策者。
[00:11:32.830] [SPEAKER_01]: You're the final stamp of approval.
[00:11:32.830] [SPEAKER_01]：你是最终的认可。
[00:11:35.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's probably
[00:11:35.730] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我的意思是，我觉得这很可能
[00:11:38.410] [SPEAKER_00]: a nice thing to do to inform you, at least let you know before it gets super
[00:11:38.410] [SPEAKER_00]：这样做很好，至少在事情变得非常糟糕之前让你知道。
[00:11:43.950] [SPEAKER_00]: serious like, hey, I'm talking to this person, you guys dated, I know, you know?
[00:11:43.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我是认真的，嘿，我在跟这个人说话，你们以前交往过，我知道，你知道吗？
[00:11:49.410] [SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, because it's like, OK,
[00:11:49.410] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，是的，因为就像，好吧，
[00:11:51.370] [SPEAKER_00]: what if one of your friends is like a dog and you know this?
[00:11:51.370] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你的朋友像狗一样，而你知道这一点，那会怎么样？
[00:11:55.410] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what I mean?
[00:11:55.410] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，你明白我的意思吗？
[00:11:57.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, like, you all you guys are very close.
[00:11:57.230] [SPEAKER_00]: 你们关系真的很好。
[00:11:59.070] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that person like, hey,
[00:11:59.070] [SPEAKER_00]：但你知道那种人，就像，嘿，
[00:12:00.950] [SPEAKER_00]: they can get into their like maybe not like boyfriend girlfriend material.
[00:12:00.950] [SPEAKER_00]：他们可能会发展成类似男女朋友的关系。
[00:12:05.390] Right.
[00:12:05.390] 正确的。
[00:12:06.030] [SPEAKER_01]: Dude, honestly, like there's only so much you can do.
[00:12:06.030] [SPEAKER_01]：兄弟，说真的，你能做的也就这么多。
[00:12:08.510] [SPEAKER_01]: It's out of your hands, right?
[00:12:08.510] [SPEAKER_01]：这已经超出你的控制范围了，对吧？
[00:12:09.730] [SPEAKER_01]: Like who are you to meddle in their lives?
[00:12:09.730] [SPEAKER_01]：你凭什么干涉他们的生活？
[00:12:13.190] [SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[00:12:13.190] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。
[00:12:14.270] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Crystal, I think on the general principles of this.
[00:12:14.270] [SPEAKER_00]：我同意 Crystal 的观点，我认为在总体原则上是这样。
[00:12:17.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm the only petty one because I feel like it would really bother me.
[00:12:17.830] [SPEAKER_03]：也许只有我一个人这么小心眼，因为我觉得这件事真的会让我很烦恼。
[00:12:21.550] [SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were so quiet the whole time.
[00:12:21.550] [SPEAKER_00]: 我还以为你一直都很安静呢。
[00:12:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, nah, nah, bitch.
[00:12:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]：你就像，不，不，婊子。
[00:12:24.350] [SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait, you guys agree?
[00:12:24.350] [SPEAKER_03]：我当时就想，等等，你们同意吗？
[00:12:26.190] [SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here's the thing.
[00:12:26.190] [SPEAKER_03]：我的意思是，事情是这样的。
[00:12:26.890] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, like, what are you going to do about it?
[00:12:26.890] [SPEAKER_03]：就像你说的，你打算怎么做？
[00:12:28.990] [SPEAKER_03]: If they are meant to be or whatever, all power to them.
[00:12:28.990] [SPEAKER_03]：如果他们注定要在一起，那就祝他们幸福。
[00:12:31.870] [SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like it's definitely going to be one of those things that's like,
[00:12:31.870] [SPEAKER_03]：但我感觉这肯定会是那种事情，就像……
[00:12:36.210] [SPEAKER_03]: you know, like a juicy gossip story.
[00:12:36.210] [SPEAKER_03]：你知道，就像一个劲爆的八卦故事。
[00:12:37.930] [SPEAKER_03]: So then on those late night outs or if you're like drinking,
[00:12:37.930] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，在那些深夜外出或者喝酒的时候，
[00:12:41.190] [SPEAKER_03]: it's like a fun party story to share to be like, oh, my God, guess what's up?
[00:12:41.190] [SPEAKER_03]：这就像一个有趣的派对故事，可以分享出来，比如，哦，我的天哪，猜猜发生了什么事？
[00:12:45.110] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, isn't it crazy?
[00:12:45.110] [SPEAKER_03]：这难道不疯狂吗？
[00:12:46.530] [SPEAKER_03]: And I would just at the very least gossip a little bit about it.
[00:12:46.530] [SPEAKER_03]：我至少会稍微八卦一下这件事。
[00:12:50.790] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I mean, I would definitely be bothered
[00:12:50.790] [SPEAKER_01]：好吧，我的意思是，我肯定会很烦恼。
[00:12:53.010] [SPEAKER_01]: if it was like a meaningful relationship and it was like a close friend.
[00:12:53.010] [SPEAKER_01]：如果就像一段有意义的关系，就像一个亲密的朋友。
[00:12:57.250] [SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably be like, wait, what the fuck?
[00:12:57.250] [SPEAKER_01]：我可能会想，等等，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:12:58.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Why are you trying to date my ex? Right.
[00:12:58.870] [SPEAKER_01]：你为什么要和我前任约会？真是的。
[00:13:00.830] [SPEAKER_01]: True.
[00:13:00.830] [SPEAKER_01]：是的。
[00:13:01.350] [SPEAKER_01]: I think there's definitely a spectrum of where I do care and where I don't care.
[00:13:01.350] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为我关心的事情和不关心的事情之间肯定存在一个范围。
[00:13:07.330] [SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[00:13:07.330] [SPEAKER_01]：没错。
[00:13:08.190] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like ideally you would know about this way before they start dating,
[00:13:08.190] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得理想情况下，你应该在他们开始约会之前就知道这件事。
[00:13:11.690] [SPEAKER_00]: because if it's a close friend, they'd be like, hey, for some weird fucking reason,
[00:13:11.690] [SPEAKER_00]：因为如果是关系很亲密的朋友，他们会说，嘿，出于某种莫名其妙的原因，
[00:13:15.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with your ex again.
[00:13:15.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我又和你前任一起出去玩了。
[00:13:16.570] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh, for some weird reason, I think they're cute.
[00:13:16.570] [SPEAKER_00]：然后，哦，不知为何，我觉得它们很可爱。
[00:13:18.630] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to slowly be let down versus just like out of nowhere.
[00:13:18.630] [SPEAKER_00]：然后你会慢慢地感到失望，而不是毫无征兆地失望。
[00:13:25.810] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's just logically you're like, OK, who am I to meddle in their
[00:13:25.810] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我觉得从逻辑上讲，你会想，好吧，我有什么资格去干涉他们的事呢？
[00:13:31.110] [SPEAKER_01]: lives, right? But then feeling wise, you can't help what you feel.
[00:13:31.110] [SPEAKER_01]：活着，对吧？但当你觉得自己很睿智时，你又无法控制自己的感受。
[00:13:34.450] [SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you'll definitely feel
[00:13:34.450] [SPEAKER_01]：所以有时候你肯定会感觉
[00:13:36.090] [SPEAKER_01]: kind of bothered or petty about it or upset about it.
[00:13:36.090] [SPEAKER_01]：有点在意、有点斤斤计较、有点生气。
[00:13:40.790] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think in a lot of ways,
[00:13:40.790] [SPEAKER_03]：是的，我认为在很多方面，
[00:13:42.930] [SPEAKER_03]: complicated feelings about this is very natural.
[00:13:42.930] [SPEAKER_03]：对此产生复杂的情绪是很正常的。
[00:13:45.270] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like this person was in a specific role in your life and the other person
[00:13:45.270] [SPEAKER_03]：就好像这个人曾在你生命中扮演过某个特定的角色，而另一个人……
[00:13:49.730] [SPEAKER_03]: was, too. Now things are more things.
[00:13:49.730] [SPEAKER_03]：以前也是。现在事情更多了。
[00:13:51.370] [SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, what the fuck?
[00:13:51.370] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，这他妈到底是怎么回事？
[00:13:53.030] [SPEAKER_03]: Especially if there wasn't that long
[00:13:53.030] [SPEAKER_03]：尤其是如果时间没那么长的话
[00:13:55.610] [SPEAKER_03]: in between your breakup with this person and these two people getting together.
[00:13:55.610] [SPEAKER_03]：在你和这个人分手到这两个人在一起之间。
[00:14:00.570] [SPEAKER_03]: That would be fucked up.
[00:14:00.570] [SPEAKER_03]：那可就糟了。
[00:14:01.750] [SPEAKER_01]: I think that would bother me for sure.
[00:14:01.750] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得那肯定会让我感到困扰。
[00:14:03.610] [SPEAKER_01]: If it's many, many years later,
[00:14:03.610] [SPEAKER_01]：如果过了很多很多年，
[00:14:05.790] [SPEAKER_01]: you would hope that you're in a healthier spot and you're more OK with it.
[00:14:05.790] [SPEAKER_01]：你会希望自己现在的身体状况更好，也能更坦然地接受现状。
[00:14:09.430] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it would feel a little weird at first,
[00:14:09.430] [SPEAKER_01]：也许一开始会感觉有点奇怪，
[00:14:11.110] [SPEAKER_01]: but you would be able to quickly get over it.
[00:14:11.110] [SPEAKER_01]：但你很快就能克服它。
[00:14:14.090] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Is it ever OK for your like one,
[00:14:14.090] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。对你来说，这样可以吗？
[00:14:18.030] [SPEAKER_00]: like your best friend or one of your close friends to like immediately start
[00:14:18.030] [SPEAKER_00]：就像你最好的朋友或你的密友一样，立即开始点赞
[00:14:21.930] [SPEAKER_00]: dating your ex? No.
[00:14:21.930] [SPEAKER_00]：和前任约会？不。
[00:14:24.270] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[00:14:24.270] [SPEAKER_00]：我不这么认为。
[00:14:25.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Probably not. They can wait.
[00:14:25.370] [SPEAKER_00]：可能不会。他们可以等。
[00:14:27.910] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. But also, like if you broke up with someone,
[00:14:27.910] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊。但是，比如如果你和某人分手了，
[00:14:32.610] [SPEAKER_01]: your best friend probably knows all the gory details and it's like, oh,
[00:14:32.610] [SPEAKER_01]：你最好的朋友可能知道所有血腥的细节，然后就好像，哦，
[00:14:36.530] [SPEAKER_01]: really, you're going to date them after all that.
[00:14:36.530] [SPEAKER_01]：真的，经历了这一切之后，你还要和他们约会吗？
[00:14:39.930] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would be very hard for me to not think like, OK,
[00:14:39.930] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得我很难不去想，好吧，
[00:14:44.630] [SPEAKER_03]: so the whole time I was dating this guy, like were you crushing on him or
[00:14:44.630] [SPEAKER_03]：所以在我跟这个男生交往的这段时间里，你是不是一直暗恋他？
[00:14:49.310] [SPEAKER_03]: something, even if that was not even close to the truth,
[00:14:49.310] [SPEAKER_03]：即便那与事实相去甚远，也算是某种东西吧。
[00:14:52.490] [SPEAKER_03]: I would still think that.
[00:14:52.490] [SPEAKER_03]：我仍然这么认为。
[00:14:54.650] [SPEAKER_00]: This has happened to me before.
[00:14:54.650] [SPEAKER_00]：我以前也遇到过这种情况。
[00:14:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]: The guy wasn't like a close friend, but he was like one of my ex's friends.
[00:14:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]：那家伙不算是我的好朋友，但他就像是我前任的朋友一样。
[00:15:03.590] [SPEAKER_00]: And we got along and stuff.
[00:15:03.590] [SPEAKER_00]：我们相处得很好。
[00:15:05.110] [SPEAKER_00]: But when me and my ex went on a break
[00:15:05.110] [SPEAKER_00]：但是当我和前任分手的时候
[00:15:06.910] [SPEAKER_00]: for like a month or something, and during that month he like started
[00:15:06.910] [SPEAKER_00]：大概一个月左右吧，在那一个月里他就开始
[00:15:10.410] [SPEAKER_00]: hitting on her and then we got back together.
[00:15:10.410] [SPEAKER_00]：我追求了她，然后我们又复合了。
[00:15:13.790] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, I know about this.
[00:15:13.790] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我就想，哦，我知道这件事。
[00:15:15.450] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we broke up officially and then they got together,
[00:15:15.450] [SPEAKER_00]：然后当我们正式分手后，他们就在一起了，
[00:15:20.110] [SPEAKER_00]: it didn't feel great.
[00:15:20.110] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉不太好。
[00:15:21.450] [SPEAKER_00]: But it was also like, I mean, it's not like you said,
[00:15:21.450] [SPEAKER_00]：但同时，我的意思是，这也不像你说的那样，
[00:15:24.330] [SPEAKER_00]: like you don't have any say in their lives or my ex's life.
[00:15:24.330] [SPEAKER_00]：好像你对他们的生活或者我前任的生活没有任何发言权似的。
[00:15:27.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. She can do whatever she wants.
[00:15:27.450] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。她想做什么都可以。
[00:15:29.330] [SPEAKER_00]: It is really funny, though, the power that you have.
[00:15:29.330] [SPEAKER_00]：不过，你拥有的这种权力真是太有趣了。
[00:15:31.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Like one time I picked him up from a party.
[00:15:31.570] [SPEAKER_00]：比如有一次我从一个聚会上接他。
[00:15:33.930] [SPEAKER_00]: He was like walking out of a party and I saw him and I was
[00:15:33.930] [SPEAKER_00]：他就像刚从派对里走出来一样，我看到了他，然后我就……
[00:15:36.910] [SPEAKER_00]: like, you want to ride? And he was like, sure.
[00:15:36.910] [SPEAKER_00]：比如，你想骑车吗？他回答说，当然。
[00:15:39.670] [SPEAKER_00]: And we were just in the car.
[00:15:39.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我们当时就在车里。
[00:15:40.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I was like, show how is ex?
[00:15:40.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我当时就想，看看前任怎么样了？
[00:15:43.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[00:15:43.930] [SPEAKER_00]：很好。
[00:15:45.290] [SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I knew you hit on me.
[00:15:45.290] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉就像，我知道你在勾引我。
[00:15:46.490] [SPEAKER_00]: I knew you had fun.
[00:15:46.490] [SPEAKER_00]：我知道你玩得很开心。
[00:15:47.950] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like messing with him.
[00:15:47.950] [SPEAKER_01]：你这是在戏弄他。
[00:15:50.090] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:15:50.090] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:15:50.570] [SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[00:15:50.570] [SPEAKER_00]：真有趣。
[00:15:51.610] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually did have a situation back in high school.
[00:15:51.610] [SPEAKER_01]：我高中时确实遇到过这种情况。
[00:15:55.350] [SPEAKER_01]: Me and a good friend ended up dating like the same guy.
[00:15:55.350] [SPEAKER_01]：我和一个好朋友最后竟然像同一个人一样谈恋爱了。
[00:15:59.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I dated him shortly after she dated him.
[00:15:59.390] [SPEAKER_01]：在她和他交往后不久，我也和他交往了。
[00:16:03.510] [SPEAKER_01]: But it was kind of like I wasn't really sure what
[00:16:03.510] [SPEAKER_01]：但感觉就像我不太确定什么
[00:16:06.910] [SPEAKER_01]: was happening yet, because we're in high school.
[00:16:06.910] [SPEAKER_01]：还没发生，因为我们还在上高中。
[00:16:08.990] [SPEAKER_01]: We're stupid.
[00:16:08.990] [SPEAKER_01]：我们很愚蠢。
[00:16:10.030] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how to date people.
[00:16:10.030] [SPEAKER_01]：我们不知道该如何与人约会。
[00:16:11.670] [SPEAKER_01]: So it was during that talking phase.
[00:16:11.670] [SPEAKER_01]：所以，那是在谈话阶段。
[00:16:13.990] [SPEAKER_01]: And I guess my friend caught wind of it.
[00:16:13.990] [SPEAKER_01]：我想我的朋友也听说了这件事。
[00:16:17.130] [SPEAKER_01]: And she was actually so nice about it.
[00:16:17.130] [SPEAKER_01]：她人真的很好。
[00:16:19.130] [SPEAKER_01]: She texted me and said, oh, by the way,
[00:16:19.130] [SPEAKER_01]：她给我发短信说，哦，对了，
[00:16:21.570] [SPEAKER_01]: I heard that you and ex are talking.
[00:16:21.570] [SPEAKER_01]：我听说你和前任在联系。
[00:16:25.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say it's not an issue
[00:16:25.190] [SPEAKER_01]：我只想说这不是个问题。
[00:16:27.430] [SPEAKER_01]: with me if you were to choose to date.
[00:16:27.430] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你选择和我约会的话。
[00:16:30.270] [SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was really nice of her.
[00:16:30.270] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我觉得她人真的很好。
[00:16:32.610] [SPEAKER_01]: That's very mature, especially for high school.
[00:16:32.610] [SPEAKER_01]：这很成熟，尤其对于高中生来说。
[00:16:35.830] [SPEAKER_00]: W friend.
[00:16:35.830] [SPEAKER_00]：我的朋友。
[00:16:37.750] Yeah.
[00:16:37.750] 是的。
[00:16:39.590] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's great because I think a few years later,
[00:16:39.590] [SPEAKER_01]：这很棒，因为我认为几年后，
[00:16:42.730] [SPEAKER_01]: we were bonding over it.
[00:16:42.730] [SPEAKER_01]：我们因为这件事而增进了感情。
[00:16:44.210] [SPEAKER_01]: We're like, dude, yeah, that dude that we used to date, what the fuck?
[00:16:44.210] [SPEAKER_01]：我们当时就想，老兄，是啊，我们以前约会的那个家伙，搞什么鬼？
[00:16:48.690] [SPEAKER_03]: What came over us by then?
[00:16:48.690] [SPEAKER_03]：那时我们是怎么了？
[00:16:51.350] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[00:16:51.350] [SPEAKER_03]：好的。
[00:16:51.650] [SPEAKER_03]: So I want to ask kind of the inverse
[00:16:51.650] [SPEAKER_03]：所以我想问一个相反的问题。
[00:16:54.010] [SPEAKER_03]: of this question, which is what if you met your new SO through an ex?
[00:16:54.010] [SPEAKER_03]：这个问题指的是，如果你通过前任认识了现在的伴侣，该怎么办？
[00:17:00.490] [SPEAKER_03]: You were dating someone and then you broke up with them,
[00:17:00.490] [SPEAKER_03]：你之前和某人交往，然后你们分手了，
[00:17:03.290] [SPEAKER_03]: but you stayed close to or reconnected with your ex's friend and hit it off.
[00:17:03.290] [SPEAKER_03]：但你和前任的朋友保持了密切联系或重新建立了联系，并且相处融洽。
[00:17:07.790] [SPEAKER_03]: And now you're dating. Like, is that weird?
[00:17:07.790] [SPEAKER_03]：现在你们在谈恋爱了。这很奇怪吗？
[00:17:10.490] [SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you're kind of obligated to feel guilty about it?
[00:17:10.490] [SPEAKER_03]：你觉得你有义务为此感到内疚吗？
[00:17:13.970] [SPEAKER_03]: Or is it like fair game?
[00:17:13.970] [SPEAKER_03]：还是说这就像公平竞争？
[00:17:16.190] [SPEAKER_00]: A true love is true love.
[00:17:16.190] [SPEAKER_00]：真爱就是真爱。
[00:17:17.210] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean? Like, I can't control that shit.
[00:17:17.210] [SPEAKER_00]：你明白我的意思吗？就是，我控制不了那种事。
[00:17:18.930] [SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[00:17:18.930] [SPEAKER_00]：太疯狂了。
[00:17:21.230] [SPEAKER_01]: I think once again, it depends on how close they are to that ex.
[00:17:21.230] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得这再次取决于他们和前任的关系有多亲密。
[00:17:26.970] [SPEAKER_01]: If they're very peripheral friends,
[00:17:26.970] [SPEAKER_01]：如果他们只是关系很一般的朋友，
[00:17:29.530] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe I'd feel less weird about it.
[00:17:29.530] [SPEAKER_01]：也许我就不会觉得那么奇怪了。
[00:17:32.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even not obligated to share that information to them.
[00:17:32.110] [SPEAKER_01]：或许他们甚至没有义务向他们透露这些信息。
[00:17:37.210] [SPEAKER_01]: But I guess if they were really close friends, I would feel pretty weird about it.
[00:17:37.210] [SPEAKER_01]：但我想如果他们真的是很要好的朋友，我会觉得很奇怪。
[00:17:41.330] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:17:41.330] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:17:42.190] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess at the very least, it's just like a hilarious situation where maybe
[00:17:42.190] [SPEAKER_03]：我想至少这就像一个滑稽的情景，也许
[00:17:46.770] [SPEAKER_03]: on anniversaries you would reminisce and be like, oh, remember when we met
[00:17:46.770] [SPEAKER_03]：在纪念日那天，你会回忆往事，然后说，哦，还记得我们第一次见面吗？
[00:17:50.770] [SPEAKER_03]: through this one guy?
[00:17:50.770] [SPEAKER_03]：通过这个人？
[00:17:53.510] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some of the most successful relationships I've heard are like that.
[00:17:53.510] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得我听过的一些最成功的恋爱关系就是这样的。
[00:17:58.710] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from that situation.
[00:17:58.710] [SPEAKER_00]：他们就来自那种环境。
[00:18:00.410] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[00:18:00.410] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道为什么。
[00:18:01.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a concerning trend, but it seems to work.
[00:18:01.810] [SPEAKER_00]：这或许是一种令人担忧的趋势，但似乎行之有效。
[00:18:06.390] [SPEAKER_00]: So I can't hit on it.
[00:18:06.390] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我没办法搭讪。
[00:18:08.650] [SPEAKER_03]: It kind of makes sense in a lot of ways just because I feel like you're
[00:18:08.650] [SPEAKER_03]：从很多方面来看，这都说得通，因为我觉得你
[00:18:11.950] [SPEAKER_03]: attracted to a certain type of person usually and maybe the deviations
[00:18:11.950] [SPEAKER_03]：通常会被某种类型的人吸引，也许也会被一些偏差所吸引。
[00:18:17.030] [SPEAKER_03]: from that standard are very minimal.
[00:18:17.030] [SPEAKER_03]：从这个标准来看，数量非常少。
[00:18:19.650] [SPEAKER_03]: Naturally, your SO's friends might be similar or have similar values as your SO.
[00:18:19.650] [SPEAKER_03]：当然，你伴侣的朋友可能和你伴侣有相似之处或价值观。
[00:18:25.250] [SPEAKER_00]: Also, I assume a lot of people,
[00:18:25.250] [SPEAKER_00]：另外，我猜很多人，
[00:18:27.350] [SPEAKER_00]: their friends are mostly like their own guys.
[00:18:27.350] [SPEAKER_00]：他们的朋友大多和他们自己人一样。
[00:18:31.130] [SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of guy friends or vice versa.
[00:18:31.130] [SPEAKER_00]：他们有很多男性朋友，或者反过来也一样。
[00:18:33.430] [SPEAKER_00]: So it's like if you date someone, then you get to meet a lot of your
[00:18:33.430] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，如果你和某人约会，你就会遇到很多你的
[00:18:37.470] [SPEAKER_00]: girlfriends, girlfriends, and it's like, oh,
[00:18:37.470] [SPEAKER_00]：女朋友，女朋友，然后就好像，哦，
[00:18:40.970] [SPEAKER_00]: there's just a larger number of people.
[00:18:40.970] [SPEAKER_00]：只是人比较多而已。
[00:18:44.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I guess they opened up the pool for you to do low key.
[00:18:44.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我猜他们给你开放泳池是为了让你低调行事。
[00:18:49.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, this is like strategic dating.
[00:18:49.830] [SPEAKER_03]：等等，这就像策略性约会。
[00:18:51.990] [SPEAKER_00]: If you were a complete dog, this is the way to do it.
[00:18:51.990] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你是一条彻头彻尾的狗，这就是你该有的做法。
[00:18:57.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Just date people to date their friends.
[00:18:57.570] [SPEAKER_00]: 只是为了和他们的朋友约会而和他们约会。
[00:18:59.770] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[00:18:59.770] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，我的天哪。
[00:19:01.990] [SPEAKER_01]: You see, this is why I don't like
[00:19:01.990] [SPEAKER_01]：你看，这就是我不喜欢的原因
[00:19:04.170] [SPEAKER_01]: dating people who have mutual friends because I don't like these sticky
[00:19:04.170] [SPEAKER_01]：我不喜欢和有共同朋友的人约会，因为我不喜欢这种黏糊糊的感觉。
[00:19:08.370] [SPEAKER_01]: situations where like, oh, my God, like this person actually knows my ex or
[00:19:08.370] [SPEAKER_01]：比如，天哪，这个人居然认识我的前任，或者
[00:19:12.450] [SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, my God, this person knows half of my friend group.
[00:19:12.450] [SPEAKER_01]：我的天哪，这个人认识我一半的朋友。
[00:19:16.150] [SPEAKER_01]: They have this context of me already.
[00:19:16.150] [SPEAKER_01]：他们已经了解我的这些情况了。
[00:19:20.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[00:19:20.170] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，没错。
[00:19:21.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys like going to relationships and stuff as like a fresh, clean slate?
[00:19:21.370] [SPEAKER_00]：你们喜欢以一张白纸的状态去开始一段感情吗？
[00:19:26.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. You only know me through the context of us dating and nothing else.
[00:19:26.390] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。你只通过我们交往这件事了解我，除此之外一无所知。
[00:19:30.310] [SPEAKER_03]: For me, yes.
[00:19:30.310] [SPEAKER_03]：对我来说，是的。
[00:19:31.470] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm probably the opposite.
[00:19:31.470] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得我可能正好相反。
[00:19:33.730] [SPEAKER_03]: So for me, if I found out that this
[00:19:33.730] [SPEAKER_03]：所以对我来说，如果我发现这
[00:19:35.650] [SPEAKER_03]: new person I'm dating has a bunch of mutuals and stuff,
[00:19:35.650] [SPEAKER_03]：我新交往的对象有很多共同好友什么的，
[00:19:37.850] [SPEAKER_03]: that would totally be a green flag.
[00:19:37.850] [SPEAKER_03]：那绝对是一个绿旗。
[00:19:40.050] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, we run in the same circles.
[00:19:40.050] [SPEAKER_03]：就像，哦，我们身处同一个圈子。
[00:19:41.770] [SPEAKER_03]: But like you said, it gets messy sometimes.
[00:19:41.770] [SPEAKER_03]：但就像你说的，有时候事情会变得很混乱。
[00:19:45.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Living in the nuance is very fun.
[00:19:45.810] [SPEAKER_00]：生活在细微之处非常有趣。
[00:19:47.510] [SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[00:19:47.510] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我也不知道。
[00:19:49.410] [SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm probably more on Jesus side.
[00:19:49.410] [SPEAKER_00]：我感觉自己可能更倾向于耶稣这边。
[00:19:52.270] [SPEAKER_00]: We're like, when I go on hinge dates or even when I meet a new person that has
[00:19:52.270] [SPEAKER_00]：我们就像，当我参加 Hinge 约会，或者甚至当我遇到一个新人时，我都会这样。
[00:19:56.290] [SPEAKER_00]: no connections with it's like it's really hard to take what they say at
[00:19:56.290] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉和他们说的话完全没有联系，真的很难接受。
[00:20:00.150] [SPEAKER_00]: their word ever because you just don't know.
[00:20:00.150] [SPEAKER_00]：他们的话永远不会被采纳，因为你根本不知道。
[00:20:04.070] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. But like at least the friend, it's like it's kind of vetted.
[00:20:04.070] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。但至少像朋友那样，感觉像是经过了某种筛选。
[00:20:07.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And then yeah.
[00:20:07.630] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。然后，是啊。
[00:20:08.190] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much more tea that comes if you guys actually date.
[00:20:08.190] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你们真的交往，还会有更多八卦爆出。
[00:20:11.250] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, so you have something to tell and they can actually provide context
[00:20:11.250] [SPEAKER_00]：比如，你想说点什么，他们就能提供背景信息。
[00:20:14.870] [SPEAKER_00]: and shit. It's amazing.
[00:20:14.870] [SPEAKER_00]：真是太棒了。
[00:20:16.450] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's true.
[00:20:16.450] [SPEAKER_01]：我想确实如此。
[00:20:17.550] [SPEAKER_01]: They have like another perspective of like the current goss.
[00:20:17.550] [SPEAKER_01]：他们对当前的八卦有另一种看法。
[00:20:22.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:20:22.630] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:20:23.310] [SPEAKER_00]: If all you live for is the goss, this is like the best way to do it.
[00:20:23.310] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你活着就是为了八卦，这大概是最好的方式了。
[00:20:26.550] [SPEAKER_00]: Make the wire super cross and complicated.
[00:20:26.550] [SPEAKER_00]：把电线弄得超级交叉复杂。
[00:20:29.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess I just like the idea of getting
[00:20:29.830] [SPEAKER_01]：我想我只是喜欢得到这个想法。
[00:20:32.550] [SPEAKER_01]: to know someone kind of brand new versus hearing about this person
[00:20:32.550] [SPEAKER_01]：认识一个全新的人，和听说过这个人，是截然不同的两种情况。
[00:20:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: from everyone else. Like, oh, you're dating this person.
[00:20:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]：来自其他人的看法。比如，哦，你在和这个人约会。
[00:20:41.510] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I went to high school with them and then they start sharing
[00:20:41.510] [SPEAKER_01]：比如，我和他们一起上高中，然后他们开始分享
[00:20:44.250] [SPEAKER_01]: all these stories and I'm like, OK, well, I don't know if I necessarily
[00:20:44.250] [SPEAKER_01]：所有这些故事，我就想，好吧，我不知道我是否一定
[00:20:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]: wanted their character to be colored by that before I got to know them.
[00:20:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]：我希望在了解他们之前，他们的性格就已经被这种经历所影响。
[00:20:52.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I do.
[00:20:52.450] [SPEAKER_00]：兄弟，我同意。
[00:20:54.370] [SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so much more fun.
[00:20:54.370] [SPEAKER_00]：这样就更有趣了。
[00:20:57.950] [SPEAKER_03]: I think to be fair, I'm also like a friend data.
[00:20:57.950] [SPEAKER_03]：公平地说，我觉得我也像朋友数据一样。
[00:21:00.730] [SPEAKER_03]: So then it wouldn't be like a stranger to me.
[00:21:00.730] [SPEAKER_03]：这样一来，他对我来说就不是陌生人了。
[00:21:02.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, I probably would have known these people and friends already.
[00:21:02.830] [SPEAKER_03]：比如，我可能早就认识这些人，也认识他们的朋友了。
[00:21:06.210] [SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it wouldn't be that big
[00:21:06.210] [SPEAKER_03]：所以对我来说，这不算什么大事。
[00:21:08.650] [SPEAKER_03]: of a difference to hear about this person because we would already have
[00:21:08.650] [SPEAKER_03]：听到关于这个人的事会感觉不一样，因为我们本来就已经……
[00:21:12.350] [SPEAKER_03]: some sort of established relationship already.
[00:21:12.350] [SPEAKER_03]：已经建立了某种关系。
[00:21:15.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Right. That's fair.
[00:21:15.170] [SPEAKER_01]：没错，这很合理。
[00:21:16.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess mine also goes hand in hand with the fact that I'm not a friend data.
[00:21:16.190] [SPEAKER_01]：我想这跟我没有好友数据有关。
[00:21:20.950] [SPEAKER_01]: You're a stranger data.
[00:21:20.950] [SPEAKER_01]：你是一个陌生的数据。
[00:21:25.390] [SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't roll off the tongue as easily.
[00:21:25.390] [SPEAKER_00]：这话不太容易说出口。
[00:21:28.130] [SPEAKER_00]: It sounds a little sus, but you do you.
[00:21:28.130] [SPEAKER_00]：听起来有点可疑，但你做你自己就好。
[00:21:32.650] [SPEAKER_01]: I do have another sticky situation question for you all.
[00:21:32.650] [SPEAKER_01]：我还有一个棘手的问题想请教大家。
[00:21:36.630] [SPEAKER_01]: If you met someone who you know is
[00:21:36.630] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你遇到一个你知道是
[00:21:40.450] [SPEAKER_01]: acquainted with your ex, would you acknowledge that?
[00:21:40.450] [SPEAKER_01]：你认识你的前任吗？你会承认吗？
[00:21:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]: So like a friend of an ex?
[00:21:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]：就像前任的朋友一样？
[00:21:46.390] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. So let's say like you've met this person before at like a party or
[00:21:46.390] [SPEAKER_01]：是的。比如说，你以前在聚会之类的场合见过这个人，或者
[00:21:51.050] [SPEAKER_01]: something and then now you're meeting them again at another party.
[00:21:51.050] [SPEAKER_01]: 发生了一些事，然后现在你又在另一个聚会上遇到了他们。
[00:21:55.350] [SPEAKER_01]: And they are you know, they're like friends with your ex.
[00:21:55.350] [SPEAKER_01]：你知道，他们就像你前任的朋友一样。
[00:21:58.130] [SPEAKER_01]: Would you acknowledge that connection or just pretend you've never met them before?
[00:21:58.130] [SPEAKER_01]：你会承认这种关系，还是假装你以前从未见过他们？
[00:22:02.390] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is where earlier I was
[00:22:02.390] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，这就是我之前所在的地方。
[00:22:04.310] [SPEAKER_00]: saying, like, oh, like I want to appear like the bigger person, whatever I am.
[00:22:04.310] [SPEAKER_00]：说，就像，哦，就像我想表现得像个胸襟宽广的人，不管我到底是什么样的人。
[00:22:08.970] [SPEAKER_00]: Actually doesn't fucking matter.
[00:22:08.970] [SPEAKER_00]：其实根本无关紧要。
[00:22:09.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to appear like I got my shit together and stuff.
[00:22:09.690] [SPEAKER_00]：我想让自己看起来像个一切井井有条的人。
[00:22:12.430] [SPEAKER_00]: This is where it like ultimately matters.
[00:22:12.430] [SPEAKER_00]：这才是最终决定性因素所在。
[00:22:15.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Like in front of the friends, I like because I know what's going to happen.
[00:22:15.110] [SPEAKER_00]：就像在朋友面前一样，我喜欢这样，因为我知道接下来会发生什么。
[00:22:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, oh, my God, I ran to like this.
[00:22:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]：他们会说，哦，我的天哪，我跑过来就是这样。
[00:22:20.030] [SPEAKER_00]: I ran to Eugene. He was being so weird.
[00:22:20.030] [SPEAKER_00]：我跑去找尤金。他行为举止太奇怪了。
[00:22:24.230] [SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm going to go up there.
[00:22:24.230] [SPEAKER_00]：不，我要上去。
[00:22:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I know people.
[00:22:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]：我认识一些人。
[00:22:27.470] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm tapping people up.
[00:22:27.470] [SPEAKER_00]：我正在敲打人们。
[00:22:29.090] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm being super chill.
[00:22:29.090] [SPEAKER_00]：我非常放松。
[00:22:30.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I see you. Hey, long time no see.
[00:22:30.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我看到你了。嘿，好久不见。
[00:22:32.790] [SPEAKER_00]: How have you been? Right.
[00:22:32.790] [SPEAKER_00]：你最近怎么样？好的。
[00:22:35.610] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. And what can they do if they're weird?
[00:22:35.610] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。如果他们很怪异，他们又能做什么呢？
[00:22:37.290] [SPEAKER_00]: Then, hey, I got shit to tell my people.
[00:22:37.290] [SPEAKER_00]：嘿，我有些事要告诉我的族人。
[00:22:39.530] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. It's a win win to be chill.
[00:22:39.530] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。保持冷静是双赢。
[00:22:43.030] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's also like, I mean, I assume
[00:22:43.030] [SPEAKER_00]：而且，我的意思是，我假设
[00:22:45.070] [SPEAKER_00]: you have no weird feelings about your ex's friend.
[00:22:45.070] [SPEAKER_00]：你对前任的朋友没有任何奇怪的感觉。
[00:22:48.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. So I don't think it's that hard to act normal unless you did some
[00:22:48.310] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。所以我觉得，除非你做了什么，否则装作若无其事并不难。
[00:22:52.210] [SPEAKER_00]: weird shit with your ex and then you know that they know it.
[00:22:52.210] [SPEAKER_00]：和前任之间发生了一些奇怪的事，然后你知道他们也知道。
[00:22:55.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But that's like your problem.
[00:22:55.890] [SPEAKER_00]：但这就像是你的问题一样。
[00:22:57.370] [SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't do that.
[00:22:57.370] [SPEAKER_00]：你不应该那样做。
[00:22:59.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I don't know.
[00:22:59.370] [SPEAKER_03]：兄弟，我不知道。
[00:23:00.110] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm like chronically on chill, unfortunately.
[00:23:00.110] [SPEAKER_03]：不幸的是，我觉得自己好像一直处于一种放松的状态。
[00:23:02.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Chronically on chill is a crazy thing.
[00:23:02.830] [SPEAKER_03]：长期处于放松状态是一件很疯狂的事情。
[00:23:05.150] [SPEAKER_02]: That's so insane.
[00:23:05.150] [SPEAKER_02]：这太疯狂了。
[00:23:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know me.
[00:23:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，你认识我。
[00:23:09.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Like if I could be like Eugene, I would.
[00:23:09.090] [SPEAKER_03]：如果我能像尤金那样，我肯定会那样。
[00:23:12.870] [SPEAKER_03]: But if this person I only like kind of know, I would probably just reintroduce
[00:23:12.870] [SPEAKER_03]：但如果我只是有点喜欢这个人，我可能只会重新介绍一下。
[00:23:17.470] [SPEAKER_03]: myself and I'll be super friendly and I won't be weird.
[00:23:17.470] [SPEAKER_03]：我自己会非常友好，也不会很奇怪。
[00:23:19.670] [SPEAKER_03]: I won't be like standoffish.
[00:23:19.670] [SPEAKER_03]：我不会冷漠疏远。
[00:23:21.010] [SPEAKER_03]: I'll just be like, hi, I'm Jisoo.
[00:23:21.010] [SPEAKER_03]: 我就会说，嗨，我是Jisoo。
[00:23:22.930] [SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you. And like fresh slate.
[00:23:22.930] [SPEAKER_03]：很高兴见到你。感觉就像一张白纸。
[00:23:24.990] [SPEAKER_03]: And maybe later in the night things loosen up a little bit.
[00:23:24.990] [SPEAKER_03]：也许到了晚上晚些时候，情况会稍微放松一些。
[00:23:28.510] [SPEAKER_03]: I might mention the ex, but probably wouldn't.
[00:23:28.510] [SPEAKER_03]：我可能会提到前任，但大概不会。
[00:23:32.470] [SPEAKER_00]: So would you pretend that like the ex didn't exist?
[00:23:32.470] [SPEAKER_00]：所以你会假装前任不存在吗？
[00:23:35.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe.
[00:23:35.370] [SPEAKER_03]：嗯，也许吧。
[00:23:38.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Just wipe them from then.
[00:23:38.670] [SPEAKER_00]：那就把它们擦掉。
[00:23:40.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we went to like, yeah, I met you through like, who fucking knows anyways.
[00:23:40.230] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我们去了，嗯，我通过什么认识你的，谁知道呢。
[00:23:45.750] [SPEAKER_01]: No, because, yeah, I'm I'm worried sometimes that it's like,
[00:23:45.750] [SPEAKER_01]：不，因为，是的，我有时担心情况会像这样，
[00:23:49.830] [SPEAKER_01]: what if they go back and they're hanging out with, you know, whoever?
[00:23:49.830] [SPEAKER_01]：如果他们回去后和，你知道的，任何人混在一起怎么办？
[00:23:53.350] [SPEAKER_01]: They're like, dude, that was weird.
[00:23:53.350] [SPEAKER_01]：他们会说，老兄，这太奇怪了。
[00:23:55.010] [SPEAKER_01]: Crystal just like doesn't remember me,
[00:23:55.010] [SPEAKER_01]：Crystal好像根本不记得我了，
[00:23:56.910] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess, when we obviously met like a handful of times before.
[00:23:56.910] [SPEAKER_01]：我想，我们之前显然见过几次面。
[00:24:01.570] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, I guess I'm assuming that this is someone who I've maybe like met once and
[00:24:01.570] [SPEAKER_03]：好吧，我猜这个人我可能只见过一次，
[00:24:05.850] [SPEAKER_03]: had minimal interactions with, but I just know that they're like an ex's friend.
[00:24:05.850] [SPEAKER_03]：虽然和他们接触不多，但我知道他们就像是前任的朋友。
[00:24:09.510] [SPEAKER_03]: If we had been like somewhat friends or even acquaintances,
[00:24:09.510] [SPEAKER_03]：如果我们能算是朋友，或者哪怕只是认识的人，
[00:24:13.970] [SPEAKER_03]: I would probably say something like, oh, it's been so long since I've seen you
[00:24:13.970] [SPEAKER_03]：我可能会说，哦，好久不见了。
[00:24:18.210] [SPEAKER_03]: and like allude to the fact that it's because of the breakup or whatever.
[00:24:18.210] [SPEAKER_03]：暗示这是因为分手或其他什么原因。
[00:24:23.610] [SPEAKER_03]: That's fair. That's fair.
[00:24:23.610] [SPEAKER_03]：这很公平。这很公平。
[00:24:24.450] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been in a situation where I've met someone who knows my boyfriend's ex.
[00:24:24.450] [SPEAKER_01]：我遇到过这种情况，我遇到了一个认识我男朋友前任的人。
[00:24:31.290] [SPEAKER_01]: They were meeting for the first time,
[00:24:31.290] [SPEAKER_01]：他们是第一次见面，
[00:24:33.170] [SPEAKER_01]: like my boyfriend and that person were meeting for the first time in probably
[00:24:33.170] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我男朋友和那个人可能是第一次见面一样。
[00:24:36.190] [SPEAKER_01]: like 10 years, and I was like, dude, does this girl like remember you?
[00:24:36.190] [SPEAKER_01]：大概过了10年，我就想，老兄，这女孩还记得你吗？
[00:24:40.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Does she know you?
[00:24:40.470] [SPEAKER_01]：她认识你吗？
[00:24:41.550] [SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, I don't know.
[00:24:41.550] [SPEAKER_01]：然后他就说，我不知道。
[00:24:42.690] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we met once or twice, like in passing.
[00:24:42.690] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我们见过一两次面，就像擦肩而过。
[00:24:46.070] [SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what are you going to do?
[00:24:46.070] [SPEAKER_01]：我就想，你打算怎么办？
[00:24:47.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you going to acknowledge this or like say hi?
[00:24:47.870] [SPEAKER_01]：你打算回应一下或者打个招呼吗？
[00:24:50.770] [SPEAKER_01]: It was weird going into it.
[00:24:50.770] [SPEAKER_01]：一开始感觉很奇怪。
[00:24:52.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I was definitely overthinking it a lot.
[00:24:52.190] [SPEAKER_01]：我肯定想得太多了。
[00:24:53.930] [SPEAKER_01]: And I was excited to spectate what would happen.
[00:24:53.930] [SPEAKER_01]：我很兴奋地想看看接下来会发生什么。
[00:24:57.990] [SPEAKER_01]: Audience mode.
[00:24:57.990] [SPEAKER_01]：观众模式。
[00:24:59.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's the worst thing that can happen from like you see like your ex
[00:24:59.310] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，你看到你的前任，最糟糕的情况是什么？
[00:25:02.990] [SPEAKER_00]: is like acquaintance such friend and you decide to say something like what's
[00:25:02.990] [SPEAKER_00]：就像熟人或朋友一样，你决定说些什么，比如……
[00:25:06.450] [SPEAKER_00]: the worst case scenario that I would like to track you from wanting to do anything?
[00:25:06.450] [SPEAKER_00]：最糟糕的情况是，我希望阻止你做任何事？
[00:25:10.970] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like I can instantly think of one thing.
[00:25:10.970] [SPEAKER_03]：嗯，我觉得我能立刻想到一件事。
[00:25:13.390] [SPEAKER_03]: For example, they're like, oh, I didn't even realize that you were
[00:25:13.390] [SPEAKER_03]：例如，他们会说，哦，我都没注意到你是
[00:25:17.550] [SPEAKER_03]: this person's ex or whatever, like maybe they like really don't know.
[00:25:17.550] [SPEAKER_03]：这个人的前任之类的，也许他们真的不知道。
[00:25:20.450] [SPEAKER_03]: And then now there's like this whole story and you're like,
[00:25:20.450] [SPEAKER_03]：然后现在就有了这么一大堆故事，你会想，
[00:25:22.650] [SPEAKER_03]: like, should I dive into it or whatever?
[00:25:22.650] [SPEAKER_03]：比如，我应该深入研究一下吗？
[00:25:25.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess like another would be what if they actually like hate you?
[00:25:25.830] [SPEAKER_01]：我想另一个问题是，如果他们其实很讨厌你怎么办？
[00:25:30.290] [SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, my God.
[00:25:30.290] [SPEAKER_01]：然后他们就说，哦，我的天哪。
[00:25:31.330] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is this person doing here?
[00:25:31.330] [SPEAKER_01]：这个人在这里干什么？
[00:25:33.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, but bigger person, right?
[00:25:33.370] [SPEAKER_00]：再说一遍，不过这次是比较宽容的人，对吧？
[00:25:35.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't hate them.
[00:25:35.130] [SPEAKER_00]：因为你不恨他们。
[00:25:36.370] [SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't do anything wrong, that is true.
[00:25:36.370] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你没做错任何事，那确实如此。
[00:25:38.570] [SPEAKER_00]: That is true. They shouldn't hate you.
[00:25:38.570] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。他们不应该恨你。
[00:25:40.550] [SPEAKER_00]: Unless your ex was the one that was like stoking the hands.
[00:25:40.550] [SPEAKER_00]：除非你的前任是那个喜欢抚摸你手的人。
[00:25:43.050] [SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's like you're so
[00:25:43.050] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，你又好像……
[00:25:45.210] [SPEAKER_00]: unbothered and chill that they're just hating you for no reason.
[00:25:45.210] [SPEAKER_00]：别在意，别在意他们只是无缘无故地恨你。
[00:25:48.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You're just having fun and they're being like weird and glaring at you.
[00:25:48.130] [SPEAKER_00]：你只是在玩得开心，他们却用奇怪的眼神瞪着你。
[00:25:51.850] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, what was up with that? Right.
[00:25:51.850] [SPEAKER_00]：那到底是怎么回事？没错。
[00:25:53.650] [SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.
[00:25:53.650] [SPEAKER_01]：这很公平。
[00:25:54.750] [SPEAKER_01]: I think these are probably more manageable when you know your breakup is like a
[00:25:54.750] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得如果你知道你的分手就像……，这些事情可能更容易处理。
[00:26:00.410] [SPEAKER_01]: pretty mature one and like one that didn't cause any crazy rifts.
[00:26:00.410] [SPEAKER_01]：相当成熟的一个，而且没有引起任何严重的冲突。
[00:26:06.630] [SPEAKER_01]: But if you had like kind of a bad
[00:26:06.630] [SPEAKER_01]：但如果你遇到某种糟糕的情况
[00:26:08.890] [SPEAKER_01]: breakup where people end up really hating each other, then it's kind of more
[00:26:08.890] [SPEAKER_01]：如果分手的时候双方真的互相憎恨，那就更……
[00:26:12.990] [SPEAKER_01]: scary to think about like, oh, my God, should I be interacting with this
[00:26:12.990] [SPEAKER_01]：想想就觉得可怕，天哪，我应该和这个互动吗？
[00:26:16.490] [SPEAKER_01]: person's friends when they obviously hate me?
[00:26:16.490] [SPEAKER_01]：明明别人讨厌我，他们还会跟我做朋友吗？
[00:26:20.010] [SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever had to meet your ex's ex?
[00:26:20.010] [SPEAKER_00]：你们有没有遇到过前任的前任？
[00:26:25.210] [SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[00:26:25.210] [SPEAKER_01]：哇。
[00:26:27.470] [SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never.
[00:26:27.470] [SPEAKER_01]：不，我从来没有。
[00:26:29.430] [SPEAKER_01]: I personally have not, but I have had an ex meet one of my exes when we were dating.
[00:26:29.430] [SPEAKER_01]：我个人没有，但我有前任在我们交往期间见过我的前任之一。
[00:26:37.050] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK. Yeah.
[00:26:37.050] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，好的。是的。
[00:26:38.030] [SPEAKER_00]: So so I am your ex in that situation.
[00:26:38.030] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，在这种情况下，我就是你的前任。
[00:26:41.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Wait, no, wait.
[00:26:41.110] [SPEAKER_00]：等等，不，等等。
[00:26:42.770] [SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:42.770] [SPEAKER_00]：不，不，不，不，不。
[00:26:43.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry. This got really confusing.
[00:26:43.930] [SPEAKER_00]：抱歉，刚才有点混乱。
[00:26:45.470] [SPEAKER_00]: I was that I was I met my ex's ex once or not even once.
[00:26:45.470] [SPEAKER_00]：我曾经是那样的人，我曾经见过我前任的前任一次，或者一次都没有。
[00:26:51.710] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm currently living in this right now.
[00:26:51.710] [SPEAKER_00]：我的意思是，我现在就生活在这种环境中。
[00:26:54.670] [SPEAKER_00]: My ex's ex is friends with my friends.
[00:26:54.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我前任的前任和我的朋友是朋友。
[00:26:57.790] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so I see him at parties all the time now.
[00:26:57.790] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，我现在经常在派对上看到他。
[00:27:01.530] [SPEAKER_00]: And like I've heard about this guy for
[00:27:01.530] [SPEAKER_00]：而且我听说过这个人……
[00:27:03.350] [SPEAKER_00]: so long and heard so much shit like all this stuff.
[00:27:03.350] [SPEAKER_00]：这么久了，听了太多像这样的破事。
[00:27:07.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, it does one thing when I'm
[00:27:07.130] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，当我……的时候，它只会做一件事
[00:27:08.630] [SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, my gosh, she's going to talk about me the same way.
[00:27:08.630] [SPEAKER_00]：就像，哦，我的天哪，她也会用同样的方式谈论我。
[00:27:11.210] [SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy because he's pretty chill, honestly.
[00:27:11.210] [SPEAKER_00]：这太不可思议了，因为说实话，他其实挺冷静的。
[00:27:12.970] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, you're not exactly what my ex said.
[00:27:12.970] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我就想，哇，你跟我前任说的完全不一样。
[00:27:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]: So now I know that that's fine.
[00:27:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]：现在我知道这样没问题了。
[00:27:20.030] [SPEAKER_00]: But it's also really fun to like, I like we'll just be like, hey,
[00:27:20.030] [SPEAKER_00]：但像这样也很有趣，我喜欢我们就像，嘿，
[00:27:25.210] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah, how do I know you again? Oh, that's right.
[00:27:25.210] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我怎么认识你的？哦，对了。
[00:27:27.350] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:27:27.350] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:27:28.030] [SPEAKER_00]: And just make it uncomfortable.
[00:27:28.030] [SPEAKER_00]：就让它变得不舒服。
[00:27:29.670] [SPEAKER_00]: One time I took a picture with him at a party and I was like,
[00:27:29.670] [SPEAKER_00]：有一次我在一个派对上和他合影，当时我就想，
[00:27:31.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send this to my ex if you like don't drink.
[00:27:31.830] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你愿意，就别喝酒，我要把这个发给我的前任。
[00:27:33.690] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[00:27:33.690] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，我的天哪。
[00:27:34.870] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, that's so. Wait, did you actually send it?
[00:27:34.870] [SPEAKER_03]：等等，真的吗？等等，你真的发过去了吗？
[00:27:37.370] [SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[00:27:37.370] [SPEAKER_00]：不，不，不。
[00:27:38.710] [SPEAKER_00]: I do have the picture, though.
[00:27:38.710] [SPEAKER_00]：不过，我确实有这张照片。
[00:27:39.970] [SPEAKER_00]: It is a crazy picture.
[00:27:39.970] [SPEAKER_00]：这真是一幅疯狂的画面。
[00:27:40.890] [SPEAKER_00]: It also you know what it does,
[00:27:40.890] [SPEAKER_00]：你也知道它的作用，
[00:27:42.550] [SPEAKER_00]: it also makes you look at yourself and be like, wow, I am a type.
[00:27:42.550] [SPEAKER_00]：这也会让你审视自己，然后想，哇，我就是这种类型。
[00:27:47.130] [SPEAKER_00]: I am a subset of a personality that because I see this guy and I'm like,
[00:27:47.130] [SPEAKER_00]：我属于某种特定人格类型，因为我看到这个人，我就想，
[00:27:53.350] [SPEAKER_00]: I see it, I see it.
[00:27:53.350] [SPEAKER_00]：我看到了，我看到了。
[00:27:55.210] [SPEAKER_00]: We're both like the same height.
[00:27:55.210] [SPEAKER_00]：我们俩身高差不多。
[00:27:56.690] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, all right.
[00:27:56.690] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，好的。
[00:27:57.870] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's so funny, honestly.
[00:27:57.870] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，说真的，这太搞笑了。
[00:28:00.770] [SPEAKER_03]: And OK, do you like have you ever
[00:28:00.770] [SPEAKER_03]：好的，你喜欢吗？你曾经有过吗？
[00:28:02.970] [SPEAKER_03]: talked about your ex with this guy like, oh, did she do this and this?
[00:28:02.970] [SPEAKER_03]: 你跟这个人谈论你的前任，比如，哦，她做过这个和那个吗？
[00:28:07.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[00:28:07.330] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，你知道吗？
[00:28:08.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Not like specific things, but we would like
[00:28:08.110] [SPEAKER_00]：不是具体的东西，但我们想要
[00:28:11.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I think we're both respectable enough to not be like, oh, we're not airing shit
[00:28:11.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得我们俩都足够体面，不会像有些人那样，什么都不播。
[00:28:15.170] [SPEAKER_00]: out, right, but then like something would happen and then it would be related
[00:28:15.170] [SPEAKER_00]：没错，但是之后好像会发生什么事，然后就相关了。
[00:28:19.570] [SPEAKER_00]: to like my ex and then I give him a look.
[00:28:19.570] [SPEAKER_00]：我喜欢我的前任，然后我看了他一眼。
[00:28:22.310] [SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, yeah, I know, right?
[00:28:22.310] [SPEAKER_00]：他会说，是啊，我知道，对吧？
[00:28:25.450] [SPEAKER_00]: That's all we need to say.
[00:28:25.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我们只需要说这些。
[00:28:26.990] [SPEAKER_00]: That's it. Move on.
[00:28:26.990] [SPEAKER_00]：就这样。继续吧。
[00:28:28.450] [SPEAKER_03]: This is wild.
[00:28:28.450] [SPEAKER_03]：这太疯狂了。
[00:28:29.670] [SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like new nightmare unlocked.
[00:28:29.670] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这就像是解锁了新的噩梦。
[00:28:32.990] [SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny, though.
[00:28:32.990] [SPEAKER_00]：不过，这真的太搞笑了。
[00:28:34.130] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really funny.
[00:28:34.130] [SPEAKER_00]：这真的很有趣。
[00:28:35.210] [SPEAKER_00]: You should experience it once if you never have.
[00:28:35.210] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你从未体验过，你应该体验一次。
[00:28:37.170] [SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[00:28:37.170] [SPEAKER_00]：太好了。
[00:28:38.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you're both exes, it can be funny and like you can bond over it.
[00:28:38.190] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得如果你们都是前任，这会很有趣，而且你们可以借此建立联系。
[00:28:43.050] [SPEAKER_01]: But if like someone is currently dating
[00:28:43.050] [SPEAKER_01]：但如果像某人目前正在约会的话
[00:28:44.890] [SPEAKER_01]: that person and the other person's an ex, then it might be a little awkward.
[00:28:44.890] [SPEAKER_01]：如果那个人是你的前任，那可能会有点尴尬。
[00:28:49.510] [SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[00:28:49.510] [SPEAKER_01]：没错。
[00:28:50.610] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's why you just have to just pull out the bigger person
[00:28:50.610] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我觉得这就是为什么你只需要拿出胸襟宽广的人来解决问题的原因。
[00:28:53.510] [SPEAKER_00]: thing again, where it's like no matter what you've heard about me or
[00:28:53.510] [SPEAKER_00]：又是这件事，不管你听说过关于我的什么，或者
[00:28:58.090] [SPEAKER_00]: or like how I may appear or whatever, I'm going to be a normal person.
[00:28:58.090] [SPEAKER_00]：不管我看起来如何，不管怎样，我都会做一个普通人。
[00:29:02.430] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's up to you to be the weird one.
[00:29:02.430] [SPEAKER_00]：而你是否想成为那个特立独行的人，就取决于你了。
[00:29:04.630] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, then like, hey, good luck with that.
[00:29:04.630] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你真这么做了，那就祝你好运吧。
[00:29:07.790] [SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[00:29:07.790] [SPEAKER_02]：好的。
[00:29:08.750] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I want to pivot a little bit
[00:29:08.750] [SPEAKER_03]：好的，我想稍微转换一下话题。
[00:29:11.450] [SPEAKER_03]: away from exes and more about how we handle situations in current relationships.
[00:29:11.450] [SPEAKER_03]：远离前任，更多地关注我们如何处理当前关系中的情况。
[00:29:18.610] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to introduce the perilla leaf situation to us all.
[00:29:18.610] [SPEAKER_03]：我将向大家介绍紫苏叶的情况。
[00:29:22.750] [SPEAKER_03]: And for some context, this is like
[00:29:22.750] [SPEAKER_03]：为了提供一些背景信息，这就像……
[00:29:25.010] [SPEAKER_03]: a hypothetical situation that blew up in Korea as like kind of like a test
[00:29:25.010] [SPEAKER_03]：一个在韩国引发轩然大波的假设情境，就像一场测试。
[00:29:29.410] [SPEAKER_03]: to see how different people react to the same type of like weird situation.
[00:29:29.410] [SPEAKER_03]：看看不同的人对同一种奇怪的情况会有什么反应。
[00:29:35.090] [SPEAKER_03]: But perilla leaves are a banchan or like
[00:29:35.090] [SPEAKER_03]：但是紫苏叶是一种韩式小菜，或者类似的东西
[00:29:38.310] [SPEAKER_03]: a side dish that often comes out with Korean food.
[00:29:38.310] [SPEAKER_03]：韩式料理中经常出现的配菜。
[00:29:41.190] [SPEAKER_03]: And the interesting thing about it is it's really thin layers of leaves
[00:29:41.190] [SPEAKER_03]：有趣的是，它的叶子层非常薄。
[00:29:45.810] [SPEAKER_03]: and it's like all marinating in the sauce.
[00:29:45.810] [SPEAKER_03]：就像所有东西都在酱汁里腌制一样。
[00:29:48.710] [SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes if you want to just pick one up, it's not like a solo act.
[00:29:48.710] [SPEAKER_03]：所以有时候，如果你只想拿起一个，那可不像是独奏。
[00:29:52.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you could be struggling and then you need someone else's set of
[00:29:52.610] [SPEAKER_03]：就像你可能正在苦苦挣扎，然后你需要别人的一套……
[00:29:55.510] [SPEAKER_03]: chopsticks to like hold down the other leaves so that you could just peel one.
[00:29:55.510] [SPEAKER_03]：用筷子把其他叶子压住，这样你就可以只剥一片叶子了。
[00:29:59.430] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's cultural context for you guys.
[00:29:59.430] [SPEAKER_03]：这就是你们的文化背景。
[00:30:02.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading a sub stack about this right now.
[00:30:02.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我正在阅读一篇关于此主题的子堆栈。
[00:30:04.270] Oh, my God.
[00:30:04.270] 我的天啊。
[00:30:05.650] [SPEAKER_03]: A whole sub stack about it.
[00:30:05.650] [SPEAKER_03]：关于这件事，我们有很多讨论。
[00:30:08.310] [SPEAKER_03]: So say you are eating dinner with a group of friends and your SO is there
[00:30:08.310] [SPEAKER_03]：假设你和一群朋友一起吃饭，你的伴侣也在场。
[00:30:13.610] [SPEAKER_03]: and across from you, someone is struggling to pick up some food.
[00:30:13.610] [SPEAKER_03]：在你对面，有人正费力地捡起一些食物。
[00:30:18.070] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you care if your SO helps that person and puts their chopsticks on
[00:30:18.070] [SPEAKER_03]：如果你的伴侣帮助那个人并把筷子放在……你会介意吗？
[00:30:22.390] [SPEAKER_03]: something to like help them peel off that leaf?
[00:30:22.390] [SPEAKER_03]：有没有什么办法能帮他们把叶子剥掉？
[00:30:25.490] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I wouldn't care too much, but it also kind of depends on like the follow
[00:30:25.490] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得我不会太在意，但这也要看情况，比如……
[00:30:31.150] [SPEAKER_01]: up. Is your SO really paying attention to this person?
[00:30:31.150] [SPEAKER_01]：向上。你的另一半真的在注意这个人吗？
[00:30:35.990] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they were doing that.
[00:30:35.990] [SPEAKER_01]：这就是他们这样做的原因。
[00:30:37.890] [SPEAKER_01]: Or was it just an act of kindness?
[00:30:37.890] [SPEAKER_01]：或者这只是一种善意的行为？
[00:30:39.650] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, OK, whatever.
[00:30:39.650] [SPEAKER_01]：然后就好像，好吧，随便吧。
[00:30:42.630] [SPEAKER_03]: True. Like, why are you watching this person and what kind of panchan they're eating?
[00:30:42.630] [SPEAKER_03]：没错。比如，你为什么盯着这个人看，还有他在吃什么小菜？
[00:30:46.890] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're like, OK, suddenly you're like,
[00:30:46.890] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，你会想，好吧，突然间你会想，
[00:30:49.290] [SPEAKER_01]: moving all the panchan to them and like giving them napkins and chopsticks and stuff.
[00:30:49.290] [SPEAKER_01]：把所有的小菜都端给他们，比如给他们餐巾纸、筷子之类的。
[00:30:54.530] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's going on?
[00:30:54.530] [SPEAKER_01]：到底发生了什么事？
[00:30:55.670] [SPEAKER_00]: But what if they're really good friends
[00:30:55.670] [SPEAKER_00]：但如果他们是很好的朋友呢？
[00:30:57.130] [SPEAKER_00]: and your SO is just a really attentive and nice person?
[00:30:57.130] [SPEAKER_00]：你的另一半是一个非常体贴、很好的人吗？
[00:31:01.290] [SPEAKER_01]: Then it matters situationally.
[00:31:01.290] [SPEAKER_01]：那就要视情况而定了。
[00:31:03.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you are caring for this person more than you're caring for me when I
[00:31:03.110] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，你关心这个人比关心我还多啊。
[00:31:08.690] [SPEAKER_01]: should be your priority.
[00:31:08.690] [SPEAKER_01]：这应该是你的首要任务。
[00:31:10.530] [SPEAKER_01]: Then that's where it's like, OK, it's starting to feel a little weird.
[00:31:10.530] [SPEAKER_01]：然后就会觉得，好吧，这开始有点奇怪了。
[00:31:15.510] [SPEAKER_01]: But if it's just normal friendly behavior,
[00:31:15.510] [SPEAKER_01]：但如果只是正常的友好行为，
[00:31:17.730] [SPEAKER_01]: then I think it's like very understandable.
[00:31:17.730] [SPEAKER_01]：那我觉得就很容易理解了。
[00:31:20.430] [SPEAKER_01]: True.
[00:31:20.430] [SPEAKER_01]：是的。
[00:31:21.450] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm in a similar situation where it would probably depend on how secure I
[00:31:21.450] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得我的情况也类似，这可能取决于我的安全措施是否到位。
[00:31:27.170] [SPEAKER_03]: feel in this relationship and like how my SO normally is.
[00:31:27.170] [SPEAKER_03]：在这段关系中，我感觉自己像我的伴侣，也喜欢他/她平时的样子。
[00:31:31.330] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think I would also feel like, OK, there's all these people at this
[00:31:31.330] [SPEAKER_03]：但我觉得我也会想，好吧，这里有这么多人
[00:31:36.090] [SPEAKER_03]: dinner table and of all of us, you're the one who has to put your
[00:31:36.090] [SPEAKER_03]：餐桌上，我们所有人中，偏偏是你得把你的
[00:31:40.470] [SPEAKER_03]: chopsticks out for this girl to like pick up her leaf.
[00:31:40.470] [SPEAKER_03]: 拿出筷子，让这位女孩像吃树叶一样吃掉她。
[00:31:43.330] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, how come the other nine people at this table aren't doing anything?
[00:31:43.330] [SPEAKER_03]：比如说，为什么这张桌子上的其他九个人什么都不做？
[00:31:47.450] [SPEAKER_01]: Hey, man, one person's like across diagonally.
[00:31:47.450] [SPEAKER_01]：嘿，伙计，有一个人斜对面。
[00:31:50.490] [SPEAKER_01]: They can't reach.
[00:31:50.490] [SPEAKER_01]：他们联系不上。
[00:31:51.590] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, then walk over.
[00:31:51.590] [SPEAKER_01]：好的，那就走过来。
[00:31:55.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what?
[00:31:55.450] [SPEAKER_00]：嘿，你知道吗？
[00:31:56.930] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you date him.
[00:31:56.930] 这就是你和他约会的原因。
[00:31:57.870] [SPEAKER_00]: He's the one with initiative, right?
[00:31:57.870] [SPEAKER_00]：他是个很有主见的人，对吧？
[00:32:00.950] [SPEAKER_00]: You date a man that knows what he wants.
[00:32:00.950] [SPEAKER_00]：你应该和知道自己想要什么的男人约会。
[00:32:03.430] [SPEAKER_01]: I think the ideal situation here is like another girlfriend would help.
[00:32:03.430] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为理想的情况是再找个女朋友会有帮助。
[00:32:07.410] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[00:32:07.410] [SPEAKER_01]：好的。
[00:32:07.910] [SPEAKER_03]: True, true.
[00:32:07.910] [SPEAKER_03]：没错，没错。
[00:32:09.390] [SPEAKER_03]: Or it's like you see your SO's chopsticks going,
[00:32:09.390] [SPEAKER_03]：或者就像你看到你伴侣的筷子在动，
[00:32:12.510] [SPEAKER_03]: you like smack them out of the way and you put yours there.
[00:32:12.510] [SPEAKER_03]：你喜欢把它们打到一边，然后把自己的放在那里。
[00:32:16.690] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I can be chivalrous too.
[00:32:16.690] [SPEAKER_01]：你好像在说，我也可以很绅士。
[00:32:20.190] [SPEAKER_00]: What if he uses the back of his chopstick respectfully?
[00:32:20.190] [SPEAKER_00]：如果他恭敬地用筷子背面夹取食物呢？
[00:32:24.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, it's still it's the action that matters, right?
[00:32:24.710] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，我的意思是，最终还是行动最重要，对吧？
[00:32:27.890] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:27.890] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，是啊。
[00:32:29.430] [SPEAKER_00]: Ask some questions about the situation.
[00:32:29.430] [SPEAKER_00]：询问一些关于情况的问题。
[00:32:31.670] [SPEAKER_00]: So so OK, for a girl or like the opposite,
[00:32:31.670] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，好吧，对女孩来说是这样，或者反过来也一样，
[00:32:36.550] [SPEAKER_00]: same sexual preference as what your SO is into.
[00:32:36.550] [SPEAKER_00]：和你的伴侣有相同的性偏好。
[00:32:42.150] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:32:42.150] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。
[00:32:42.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if it's a dude, if it's a straight guy and a straight guy,
[00:32:42.830] [SPEAKER_00]：比如如果是个男的，如果是个直男，而且还是直男，
[00:32:45.090] [SPEAKER_00]: it's like whatever.
[00:32:45.090] [SPEAKER_00]：随便吧。
[00:32:47.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:47.190] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，是啊。
[00:32:48.090] [SPEAKER_00]: OK. And also what if he does this for maybe not every girl, but like enough
[00:32:48.090] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。还有，如果他不是对每个女孩都这样做，而是对足够多的女孩这样做呢？
[00:32:53.450] [SPEAKER_00]: or like it's like he just does it all the time.
[00:32:53.450] [SPEAKER_00]：或者就像他一直都在这样做一样。
[00:32:57.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:57.830] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，是啊，是啊。
[00:32:59.110] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[00:32:59.110] [SPEAKER_03]：嗯，我不知道。
[00:33:00.210] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like then why are you the perilla man?
[00:33:00.210] [SPEAKER_03]：那你为什么是紫苏人呢？
[00:33:02.290] [SPEAKER_03]: Like just eat your own meal.
[00:33:02.290] [SPEAKER_03]：就像吃你自己的饭一样。
[00:33:03.950] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.
[00:33:03.950] [SPEAKER_03]：我不明白。
[00:33:06.930] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, give the other single people a chance to help that person.
[00:33:06.930] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，给其他单身人士一个帮助那个人的机会吧。
[00:33:14.270] [SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[00:33:14.270] [SPEAKER_00]：有意思，有意思。
[00:33:15.890] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a situation that happened to me once that kind of bothered me.
[00:33:15.890] [SPEAKER_01]：我曾经遇到过一件让我有点困扰的事情。
[00:33:19.930] [SPEAKER_01]: We were eating at a restaurant and there's a certain side dish that I really like.
[00:33:19.930] [SPEAKER_01]：我们在一家餐馆吃饭，我特别喜欢一道配菜。
[00:33:25.010] [SPEAKER_01]: And then my boyfriend at the time was like, oh, my God,
[00:33:25.010] [SPEAKER_01]：然后我当时的男朋友就说，哦，我的天哪，
[00:33:29.830] [SPEAKER_01]: you really like this side dish and pushed it towards another girl.
[00:33:29.830] [SPEAKER_01]：你真的很喜欢这道配菜，还把它推给了另一个女孩。
[00:33:34.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you were going to say to you,
[00:33:34.190] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，我还以为你要对你说，
[00:33:38.030] [SPEAKER_03]: that's not OK.
[00:33:38.030] [SPEAKER_03]：这可不行。
[00:33:40.010] [SPEAKER_00]: I would fail all of your tests if we ever ate Korean food together.
[00:33:40.010] [SPEAKER_00]：如果我们一起吃韩国菜，我肯定会考不过你所有的测试。
[00:33:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[00:33:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，我的天哪。
[00:33:45.950] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've never considered these things.
[00:33:45.950] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，我从来没考虑过这些事情。
[00:33:48.630] [SPEAKER_03]: I think the logic is kind of like, do I want to date a nice man?
[00:33:48.630] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这逻辑有点像，我是否想和一个好男人约会？
[00:33:52.870] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.
[00:33:52.870] [SPEAKER_03]：是的，当然。
[00:33:54.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Manners and being polite are super important.
[00:33:54.570] [SPEAKER_03]：礼貌和待人友善非常重要。
[00:33:56.670] [SPEAKER_03]: But you don't want to date like someone who's nice to everyone equally.
[00:33:56.670] [SPEAKER_03]：但你不想像对每个人都一样好的人那样谈恋爱。
[00:34:00.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Then it's like, am I even special or are you literally the perilla man?
[00:34:00.510] [SPEAKER_03]：那就好像，我到底是不是特别的，还是你就是紫苏先生？
[00:34:04.590] [SPEAKER_00]: I get what you mean.
[00:34:04.590] [SPEAKER_00]：我明白你的意思。
[00:34:06.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I get what you mean.
[00:34:06.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我明白你的意思。
[00:34:07.950] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like, why is this other person on the top of the list when I
[00:34:07.950] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，这就好比，为什么另一个人排在第一位，而我明明排在第一位？
[00:34:12.950] [SPEAKER_01]: have this preference that you should know?
[00:34:12.950] [SPEAKER_01]：你有什么偏好是你应该知道的吗？
[00:34:15.370] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[00:34:15.370] [SPEAKER_01]：是的。
[00:34:17.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. OK.
[00:34:17.230] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。
[00:34:19.090] [SPEAKER_01]: Eugene's like, what if all his relationships?
[00:34:19.090] [SPEAKER_01]：尤金心想，如果他所有的人际关系都……？
[00:34:23.030] [SPEAKER_00]: No. OK. OK. Because OK, and GSU probably knows this better.
[00:34:23.030] [SPEAKER_00]：不。好吧。好吧。因为好吧，而且乔治亚州立大学可能更清楚这一点。
[00:34:25.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of my close friends are girls.
[00:34:25.890] [SPEAKER_00]：我的很多好朋友都是女生。
[00:34:28.550] [SPEAKER_00]: And these are people I've known for like a long time.
[00:34:28.550] [SPEAKER_00]：这些人我都认识很久了。
[00:34:30.470] [SPEAKER_03]: Right. Right.
[00:34:30.470] [SPEAKER_03]：对。对。
[00:34:32.110] [SPEAKER_00]: So if I was in this situation,
[00:34:32.110] [SPEAKER_00]：所以如果我处在这种情况下，
[00:34:35.130] [SPEAKER_00]: I would be like, oh, yeah, of course I know what you want.
[00:34:35.130] [SPEAKER_00]：我会说，哦，是啊，我当然知道你想要什么。
[00:34:36.890] [SPEAKER_00]: I've fucking known you for 10 years.
[00:34:36.890] [SPEAKER_00]：我他妈的认识你10年了。
[00:34:38.650] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that type of thing.
[00:34:38.650] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，就是那种事。
[00:34:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about it with my
[00:34:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]：我和我……谈过这件事
[00:34:43.510] [SPEAKER_00]: girl space friends too, like these situations.
[00:34:43.510] [SPEAKER_00]：女生朋友也喜欢这样的情况。
[00:34:45.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I totally get the idea that, oh, you want to feel special.
[00:34:45.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我完全理解你想让自己感觉特别的想法。
[00:34:50.590] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. So it's like if you're being
[00:34:50.590] [SPEAKER_00]：对。所以就像如果你是
[00:34:51.870] [SPEAKER_00]: the same way to everyone, especially everyone, in my case, to all the girls
[00:34:51.870] [SPEAKER_00]：对每个人都一样，尤其是对所有人，就我而言，是对所有女孩。
[00:34:56.250] [SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, it's like that is it's not like that.
[00:34:56.250] [SPEAKER_00]：或者随便什么，就是这样，又不是那样。
[00:34:59.610] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not weird.
[00:34:59.610] [SPEAKER_00]：这并不奇怪。
[00:35:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]: The weird part is you're not being extra something to your SO.
[00:35:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]：奇怪的是，你并没有对你的另一半格外关照。
[00:35:04.130] [SPEAKER_00]: I totally get that.
[00:35:04.130] [SPEAKER_00]：我完全明白。
[00:35:05.910] [SPEAKER_00]: But it's also like if I've been dating
[00:35:05.910] [SPEAKER_00]：但这也就像我一直在约会一样
[00:35:08.270] [SPEAKER_00]: someone for less than a year and they're expecting me to not treat
[00:35:08.270] [SPEAKER_00]：认识不到一年，他们就指望我不对待某人。
[00:35:12.930] [SPEAKER_00]: my friends more specially that I've known for 10 years,
[00:35:12.930] [SPEAKER_00]：我的朋友们，特别是那些我认识了10年的朋友们，
[00:35:16.610] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm like, you know, they're like I've known them for 10 years
[00:35:16.610] [SPEAKER_00]：我的意思是，你知道，我认识他们已经十年了。
[00:35:20.870] [SPEAKER_00]: in a way. Right.
[00:35:20.870] [SPEAKER_00]：某种程度上来说。没错。
[00:35:22.210] [SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I don't feel great if I have to drop my level of comfort
[00:35:22.210] [SPEAKER_00]：当然，如果不得不降低舒适度，我会感觉不太好。
[00:35:26.550] [SPEAKER_00]: with my friends so that the level of my SO is higher.
[00:35:26.550] [SPEAKER_00]：和我的朋友们一起，这样我的另一半的水平就会更高。
[00:35:30.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Like it has to be earned in the same way.
[00:35:30.630] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。就像必须通过同样的方式去获得一样。
[00:35:32.970] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I think that's fair.
[00:35:32.970] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这很公平。
[00:35:36.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, big disagreement.
[00:35:36.190] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，意见分歧很大。
[00:35:38.250] [SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fair.
[00:35:38.250] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得很公平。
[00:35:39.570] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think people have different comfort levels.
[00:35:39.570] [SPEAKER_03]：我认为人们的舒适度各不相同。
[00:35:42.610] [SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine like the types of girls
[00:35:42.610] [SPEAKER_03]：我可以想象出那种类型的女孩
[00:35:45.010] [SPEAKER_03]: that you date would be people who are more comfortable with stuff like that.
[00:35:45.010] [SPEAKER_03]：你约会的对象应该是那些对这类事情比较自在的人。
[00:35:48.950] [SPEAKER_03]: Like for me personally, I fully acknowledge you.
[00:35:48.950] [SPEAKER_03]：就我个人而言，我完全认可你。
[00:35:53.110] [SPEAKER_03]: Like I can be a little petty and I can be jealous.
[00:35:53.110] [SPEAKER_03]：我有时会有点小气，也会有点嫉妒。
[00:35:55.670] [SPEAKER_03]: So then I feel like I need someone who can make me feel secure and maybe
[00:35:55.670] [SPEAKER_03]：所以我觉得我需要一个能让我感到安全的人，也许
[00:36:00.870] [SPEAKER_03]: avoid some of these situations where I'm like, oh, I don't feel super comfortable
[00:36:00.870] [SPEAKER_03]：尽量避免一些让我感觉不太舒服的情况。
[00:36:04.130] [SPEAKER_01]: with that. But then if this was like reversed for you, Eugene,
[00:36:04.130] [SPEAKER_01]：就是这样。但如果这对你来说情况正好相反，尤金，
[00:36:08.230] [SPEAKER_01]: like what if you're dating someone and then this girl is constantly dropping you
[00:36:08.230] [SPEAKER_01]：比如，如果你在和某人约会，然后这个女孩总是甩了你怎么办？
[00:36:12.110] [SPEAKER_01]: to go hang out with her guy friends who she's been friends with like for 10
[00:36:12.110] [SPEAKER_01]：去和她认识了大概10年的男性朋友们一起玩。
[00:36:15.830] [SPEAKER_01]: years, you would be OK with that?
[00:36:15.830] [SPEAKER_01]：几年，你觉得可以吗？
[00:36:18.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:36:18.570] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:36:20.470] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, like, like, I mean, if she's like backing out of our hangout,
[00:36:20.470] [SPEAKER_00]: 哦，好吧，我的意思是，如果她要取消我们的聚会，
[00:36:24.450] [SPEAKER_00]: staying out with them, then that's fucked up.
[00:36:24.450] [SPEAKER_00]：跟他们一起出去玩，那就太糟糕了。
[00:36:25.950] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, like if there's a pie chart
[00:36:25.950] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，比如说，如果有一张饼图的话
[00:36:27.850] [SPEAKER_00]: of her priorities and her priority with with hang out with her lifelong friends
[00:36:27.850] [SPEAKER_00]：她最重视的事情之一就是和她一生的挚友们一起玩耍。
[00:36:32.950] [SPEAKER_00]: or like people that she trusts and cares about is this big,
[00:36:32.950] [SPEAKER_00]：或者说，她信任和关心的人就这么大，
[00:36:36.090] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect to take a big part of that pie chart until I'm also at that
[00:36:36.090] [SPEAKER_00]：在我达到那个水平之前，我不指望能在那张饼图中占据很大一部分份额。
[00:36:41.310] [SPEAKER_00]: level with her, which is like who knows how long that takes.
[00:36:41.310] [SPEAKER_00]：和她平起平坐，这就像谁知道要花多长时间。
[00:36:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]: But I guess I feel like the whole being nice to everyone thing,
[00:36:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]：但我感觉，对每个人都友善这件事，
[00:36:48.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there is a way to treat someone special.
[00:36:48.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得对待特别的人是有方法的。
[00:36:53.470] [SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, but it doesn't have to come at the expense of your other friends.
[00:36:53.470] [SPEAKER_00]：但愿如此，但这并不意味着要以牺牲你其他朋友的利益为代价。
[00:36:58.610] [SPEAKER_01]: You know? Yeah.
[00:36:58.610] [SPEAKER_01]：你知道吗？嗯。
[00:37:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm aware of that.
[00:37:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]：好像我知道似的。
[00:37:02.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Like this is getting too deep into it.
[00:37:02.450] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉这样讨论得太深入了。
[00:37:03.650] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know how a lot of people say it's like, oh, you're like girlfriend
[00:37:03.650] [SPEAKER_00]：但你知道很多人会说，哦，你就像女朋友一样。
[00:37:06.270] [SPEAKER_00]: and boyfriend should be like your best friend type of thing.
[00:37:06.270] [SPEAKER_00]：男朋友应该像你最好的朋友那样。
[00:37:08.850] [SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, but if your best friend was like the person of the opposite
[00:37:08.850] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，是的，但是如果你的挚友是和你截然相反的那种人呢？
[00:37:12.150] [SPEAKER_00]: gender, the way you treat them is low key similar to how you would treat
[00:37:12.150] [SPEAKER_00]：性别，你对待他们的方式与你对待其他人的方式其实很相似。
[00:37:15.430] [SPEAKER_00]: yourself, I think to some extent, right?
[00:37:15.430] [SPEAKER_00]：我想在某种程度上，你自己也是这样，对吧？
[00:37:19.030] [SPEAKER_00]: Just because how much you care about each other.
[00:37:19.030] [SPEAKER_00]：就因为你们彼此有多么在乎对方。
[00:37:21.010] [SPEAKER_00]: There's like an extra layer, though.
[00:37:21.010] [SPEAKER_00]：不过，好像还有一层额外的结构。
[00:37:22.450] [SPEAKER_00]: That's like you only do the SO.
[00:37:22.450] [SPEAKER_00]：那就像你只做SO一样。
[00:37:24.090] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part where I think is stuff like,
[00:37:24.090] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这部分内容包括类似这样的：
[00:37:28.130] [SPEAKER_00]: dude, it's even hard to say right now.
[00:37:28.130] [SPEAKER_00]：老兄，现在都很难说。
[00:37:29.070] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like, you know, there's some things
[00:37:29.070] [SPEAKER_00]：我不太清楚那是什么，但就像，你知道，有些东西
[00:37:31.390] [SPEAKER_00]: as friends you guys just won't touch because there's a level of personal
[00:37:31.390] [SPEAKER_00]：作为朋友，你们不会有肢体接触，因为其中存在着某种私人关系。
[00:37:36.950] [SPEAKER_00]: privacy or space and that's where you can show that's your SO, I think.
[00:37:36.950] [SPEAKER_00]：隐私或空间，我认为你可以在这里展示那是你的另一半。
[00:37:40.810] [SPEAKER_00]: But if we're just eating fucking perilla leaves,
[00:37:40.810] [SPEAKER_00]：但如果我们只是吃该死的紫苏叶，
[00:37:44.750] [SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I'll do this for everyone I care about.
[00:37:44.750] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，我会为所有我关心的人做这件事。
[00:37:47.530] [SPEAKER_00]: So like I'll include my SO into this.
[00:37:47.530] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我会把我的另一半也算进去。
[00:37:50.150] [SPEAKER_00]: I will also do this for you.
[00:37:50.150] [SPEAKER_00]：我也会为你做这件事。
[00:37:51.670] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, it's weird if you do it for your friends, but not your SO.
[00:37:51.670] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，如果你为朋友这样做，却不为你的伴侣这样做，那就很奇怪了。
[00:37:55.590] [SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[00:37:55.590] [SPEAKER_00]：真奇怪。
[00:37:57.370] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I get what you're saying.
[00:37:57.370] [SPEAKER_01]：嗯，我想我明白你的意思了。
[00:37:58.690] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I will continue to treat my friends well,
[00:37:58.690] [SPEAKER_01]：你会想，我会继续善待我的朋友，
[00:38:01.530] [SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not going to like lower them just because I'm dating someone.
[00:38:01.530] [SPEAKER_01]：但我不会因为在和某人约会就降低我的收入。
[00:38:06.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Yeah.
[00:38:06.630] [SPEAKER_00]：对。是的。
[00:38:07.710] [SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean that you're mistreating the person you're dating.
[00:38:07.710] [SPEAKER_01]：但这并不意味着你在虐待你的约会对象。
[00:38:11.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:11.930] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，是啊，是啊。
[00:38:13.850] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, I feel like it's also a little bit hard to conceptualize this because
[00:38:13.850] [SPEAKER_03]：好的，我觉得这也有点难以理解，因为
[00:38:17.990] [SPEAKER_03]: it's not like we're eating perilla leaves super often.
[00:38:17.990] [SPEAKER_03]：我们又不是经常吃紫苏叶。
[00:38:20.850] [SPEAKER_03]: So let me try to convert this into a more common situation that we might run into.
[00:38:20.850] [SPEAKER_03]：那么，让我试着把这种情况转换成我们可能会遇到的更常见的情况。
[00:38:26.090] [SPEAKER_03]: So say you're at like an outdoor thing,
[00:38:26.090] [SPEAKER_03]：比如说，你在参加一个户外活动，
[00:38:28.310] [SPEAKER_03]: like outdoor dinner or maybe like an outdoor party or something.
[00:38:28.310] [SPEAKER_03]：比如户外晚餐，或者户外派对之类的。
[00:38:31.570] [SPEAKER_03]: And it's getting a little cold.
[00:38:31.570] [SPEAKER_03]：天气有点冷了。
[00:38:34.430] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you feel OK with your SO lending their jacket to another girl or,
[00:38:34.430] [SPEAKER_03]：你会介意你的伴侣把外套借给另一个女孩吗？
[00:38:39.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess, vice versa of like your SO wearing another guy's jacket?
[00:38:39.730] [SPEAKER_03]：我猜，反过来就像你的另一半穿了另一个男人的外套一样？
[00:38:43.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[00:38:43.810] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:38:46.990] [SPEAKER_00]: Generally, generally, yes.
[00:38:46.990] [SPEAKER_00]：一般来说，一般来说，是的。
[00:38:49.070] [SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how cold each person is.
[00:38:49.070] [SPEAKER_00]：这取决于每个人感觉有多冷。
[00:38:52.830] [SPEAKER_00]: But also, traditionally, girls don't give guys jackets as much.
[00:38:52.830] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，传统上，女生也不怎么送男生外套。
[00:38:56.710] [SPEAKER_00]: So I only know about from like me giving a jacket to someone
[00:38:56.710] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我只知道像我送别人一件外套这种事。
[00:38:59.770] [SPEAKER_00]: or like a guy friend giving a jacket to my SO.
[00:38:59.770] [SPEAKER_00]：或者像一个男性朋友送给我伴侣一件外套。
[00:39:02.270] [SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is fine.
[00:39:02.270] [SPEAKER_00]：那些东西没问题。
[00:39:03.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, as long as they're still either the same or more care for the SO in those cases.
[00:39:03.830] [SPEAKER_00]：再说一遍，只要他们仍然保持现状，或者在这些情况下更加关心他们的另一半。
[00:39:10.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not mistreating or neglecting my SO.
[00:39:10.670] [SPEAKER_00]：好像我没有虐待或忽视我的伴侣似的。
[00:39:14.370] [SPEAKER_00]: As long as that's happening, that's fine.
[00:39:14.370] [SPEAKER_00]：只要这种情况持续下去，那就没问题。
[00:39:16.050] [SPEAKER_00]: I have had an instance where I gave my jacket to a friend and then the SO didn't.
[00:39:16.050] [SPEAKER_00]：我曾经把外套送给朋友，结果他的伴侣却没要回来。
[00:39:22.270] [SPEAKER_00]: The friend's SO didn't.
[00:39:22.270] [SPEAKER_00]：朋友的伴侣没有。
[00:39:23.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Her boyfriend didn't give.
[00:39:23.890] [SPEAKER_00]：她男朋友没给。
[00:39:25.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And because he didn't realize she was cold.
[00:39:25.670] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。因为他没意识到她冷。
[00:39:28.290] [SPEAKER_00]: But I did because we've been friends for a long time.
[00:39:28.290] [SPEAKER_00]：但我这么做了，因为我们是多年的朋友。
[00:39:30.910] [SPEAKER_00]: All right. OK, I can sense that shit.
[00:39:30.910] [SPEAKER_00]：好吧。行了，我能感觉到那件事。
[00:39:33.410] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, she was shivering.
[00:39:33.410] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，她当时在发抖。
[00:39:34.910] [SPEAKER_01]: What if you just told her SO, hey, maybe you should give her your jacket?
[00:39:34.910] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你直接告诉她，嘿，也许你应该把你的外套给她？
[00:39:38.710] [SPEAKER_01]: She looks cool.
[00:39:38.710] [SPEAKER_01]：她看起来很酷。
[00:39:39.090] [SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the guy brain comes in, right?
[00:39:39.090] [SPEAKER_00]：所以这就是男人的大脑发挥作用的地方，对吧？
[00:39:41.530] [SPEAKER_00]: All right. So yes, what I did,
[00:39:41.530] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。是的，我所做的，
[00:39:43.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was kind of weird because afterwards the guy was like apologizing to me.
[00:39:43.690] [SPEAKER_00]：我知道这有点奇怪，因为事后那个人一直在向我道歉。
[00:39:48.870] [SPEAKER_00]: He was like, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:39:48.870] [SPEAKER_00]：他当时说，哦，我太抱歉了。
[00:39:50.870] [SPEAKER_00]: I should have done that, you know?
[00:39:50.870] [SPEAKER_00]：我应该那样做的，你知道吗？
[00:39:52.790] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, I've known her for so much longer than you.
[00:39:52.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我就想，兄弟，我认识她的时间比你长得多。
[00:39:55.910] [SPEAKER_00]: And also, like, it's chill.
[00:39:55.910] [SPEAKER_00]：而且，感觉很放松。
[00:39:57.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm happy for you guys.
[00:39:57.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我真为你们高兴。
[00:39:58.810] [SPEAKER_00]: You guys are great. Just cute together.
[00:39:58.810] [SPEAKER_00]：你们俩真棒。在一起太可爱了。
[00:40:00.890] [SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a big deal, right?
[00:40:00.890] [SPEAKER_00]：这没什么大不了的，对吧？
[00:40:02.650] [SPEAKER_00]: But I thought about I think if I was like, hey, you should give her your jacket.
[00:40:02.650] [SPEAKER_00]：但我当时想，如果我说，嘿，你应该把你的外套给她。
[00:40:07.930] [SPEAKER_00]: That's I think maybe among girls that would be more like that,
[00:40:07.930] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这可能更发生在女孩身上，
[00:40:11.510] [SPEAKER_00]: like girl code, that would be a bit more understandable.
[00:40:11.510] [SPEAKER_00]：就像女孩之间的暗语一样，那样就更容易理解了。
[00:40:15.750] [SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like among guy code, it'd be like, bro,
[00:40:15.750] [SPEAKER_00]：但我觉得在男人之间，大概就是这种感觉，兄弟，
[00:40:18.070] [SPEAKER_00]: why are you telling me how to do my relationship?
[00:40:18.070] [SPEAKER_00]：你凭什么告诉我该如何处理我的感情关系？
[00:40:20.350] [SPEAKER_01]: Like they get defensive about it.
[00:40:20.350] [SPEAKER_01]：他们好像对此很敏感，会进行辩解。
[00:40:22.410] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Like, why are you telling me how to be a boyfriend?
[00:40:22.410] [SPEAKER_00]：对啊。你凭什么教我怎么当男朋友？
[00:40:24.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. It's like, I'm not asking for advice.
[00:40:24.390] [SPEAKER_00]：对。就好像，我不是在寻求建议。
[00:40:26.490] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, let me do my thing.
[00:40:26.490] [SPEAKER_00]：就让我做我的事吧。
[00:40:27.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one is better.
[00:40:27.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道哪个更好。
[00:40:28.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But the way I thought about it was like, OK, I'm just like I did it so
[00:40:28.890] [SPEAKER_00]：但我当时的想法是，好吧，既然我已经这么做了，那就这样吧。
[00:40:31.650] [SPEAKER_00]: quickly and without thinking that like it's hard.
[00:40:31.650] [SPEAKER_00]：迅速且不假思索地去做，好像这很难似的。
[00:40:34.270] [SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for it to seem like I was doing it with intention.
[00:40:34.270] [SPEAKER_00]：很难让人觉得我是故意这么做的。
[00:40:36.990] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I see.
[00:40:36.990] [SPEAKER_00]：是的，我明白了。
[00:40:38.530] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I have a solution, potential solution.
[00:40:38.530] [SPEAKER_01]：好的，我有一个解决方案，一个可能的解决方案。
[00:40:40.910] [SPEAKER_01]: You just ask really loudly, oh my God, are you cold?
[00:40:40.910] [SPEAKER_01]：你只要大声问，哦我的天，你冷吗？
[00:40:46.230] [SPEAKER_00]: That's actually so genius.
[00:40:46.230] [SPEAKER_00]：这真是太妙了。
[00:40:48.290] [SPEAKER_00]: That's so smart.
[00:40:48.290] [SPEAKER_00]：这太聪明了。
[00:40:51.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I totally get what you mean, though.
[00:40:51.390] [SPEAKER_01]：我完全明白你的意思。
[00:40:52.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes it can come off as a oh, yeah, like what are you?
[00:40:52.590] [SPEAKER_01]：有时候听起来就像是“哦，是啊，你到底是什么人？”
[00:40:55.290] [SPEAKER_01]: Why are you trying to tell me what to do?
[00:40:55.290] [SPEAKER_01]：你为什么要告诉我该怎么做？
[00:40:57.750] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, dude. I think it's like a little weird.
[00:40:57.750] [SPEAKER_01]：我不知道，伙计。我觉得这有点奇怪。
[00:41:00.590] [SPEAKER_03]: It goes back to the whole thing of like of all the people here.
[00:41:00.590] [SPEAKER_03]：这要追溯到这里所有人的事情。
[00:41:04.350] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to be the one to give up your job.
[00:41:04.350] [SPEAKER_03]：好像非得是你自己放弃工作似的。
[00:41:06.810] [SPEAKER_01]: And now you're the jacket man.
[00:41:06.810] [SPEAKER_01]：现在你就是穿外套的人了。
[00:41:08.650] I know exactly.
[00:41:08.650] 我完全明白。
[00:41:10.470] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, why am I getting fucking Mr.
[00:41:10.470] [SPEAKER_03]: 比如，为什么我要他妈的得到先生
[00:41:12.050] [SPEAKER_03]: Jacket over here? And the thing is, if it was truly like really
[00:41:12.050] [SPEAKER_03]：外套在这边？而且问题是，如果真的像真的那样
[00:41:15.770] [SPEAKER_03]: freezing and this girl was like unwell showing signs of hypothermia.
[00:41:15.770] [SPEAKER_03]：天气很冷，这个女孩看起来很不舒服，出现了体温过低的症状。
[00:41:20.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course, I'm not being like, oh, like you still can't give the jacket.
[00:41:20.510] [SPEAKER_03]：是的，当然，我不是说，哦，你还是不能把外套给我。
[00:41:24.170] [SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, there's other jackets out there.
[00:41:24.170] [SPEAKER_03]：但说到底，市面上还有其他款式的夹克。
[00:41:28.190] [SPEAKER_03]: So if I could choose,
[00:41:28.190] [SPEAKER_03]：所以如果我可以选择的话，
[00:41:31.270] [SPEAKER_03]: like if I could choose, I would prefer it to not be my SO's jacket.
[00:41:31.270] [SPEAKER_03]：如果可以选的话，我希望它不是我伴侣的夹克。
[00:41:34.990] [SPEAKER_03]: But if it has to be, then so be it.
[00:41:34.990] [SPEAKER_03]：但如果非要如此，那就这样吧。
[00:41:37.150] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, question.
[00:41:37.150] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，问题。
[00:41:38.650] [SPEAKER_00]: Would you be equally or similarly bothered if your SO gave his jacket to someone,
[00:41:38.650] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你的伴侣把他的外套送给别人，你会同样或类似地介意吗？
[00:41:46.310] [SPEAKER_00]: but you weren't there?
[00:41:46.310] [SPEAKER_00]：但你当时不在场？
[00:41:48.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[00:41:48.610] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，我的天哪。
[00:41:50.150] [SPEAKER_03]: But how did I find out about it?
[00:41:50.150] [SPEAKER_03]：但我是怎么知道这件事的呢？
[00:41:52.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, OK, for example, a picture, a picture,
[00:41:52.730] [SPEAKER_00]：比如，好的，举个例子，一张图片，一张图片，
[00:41:55.590] [SPEAKER_00]: a picture or like I live near a concert venue.
[00:41:55.590] [SPEAKER_00]：一张照片，或者就像我住在音乐会场馆附近一样。
[00:41:58.650] [SPEAKER_00]: So when my friends go to the concert venue, sometimes I walk them back
[00:41:58.650] [SPEAKER_00]：所以当我的朋友们去演唱会场地时，有时我会送他们回来。
[00:42:02.090] [SPEAKER_00]: and I'll bring a jacket for them.
[00:42:02.090] [SPEAKER_00]：我会给他们带件外套。
[00:42:05.110] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, if I was dating someone, I would still do the same thing.
[00:42:05.110] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，如果我在和某人约会，我还是会做同样的事情。
[00:42:07.430] [SPEAKER_00]: But that's like, is that equally as like, oh, why are you doing that?
[00:42:07.430] [SPEAKER_00]：但这就像，哦，你为什么要这样做？
[00:42:11.150] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[00:42:11.150] [SPEAKER_03]：我不知道。
[00:42:12.510] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it almost depends on my mood, because sometimes I'm like,
[00:42:12.510] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这几乎取决于我的心情，因为有时候我会想，
[00:42:15.390] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, it's going to be cold.
[00:42:15.390] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，会很冷。
[00:42:16.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Like we should bring all our jackets and make sure everyone's warm or whatever.
[00:42:16.130] [SPEAKER_03]：就像我们应该带上所有人的外套，确保每个人都暖和些什么的。
[00:42:19.550] [SPEAKER_03]: But other times, like I just don't think I have the capacity to be OK with that.
[00:42:19.550] [SPEAKER_03]：但有时候，我觉得我根本无法接受这种情况。
[00:42:24.210] [SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe it's just like how I feel.
[00:42:24.210] [SPEAKER_03]：也许就像我的感受一样。
[00:42:27.350] [SPEAKER_01]: At least you know yourself.
[00:42:27.350] [SPEAKER_01]：至少你了解你自己。
[00:42:30.070] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, what if it was like this?
[00:42:30.070] [SPEAKER_01]：好吧，如果情况是这样的呢？
[00:42:31.890] [SPEAKER_01]: We were like at your house, Jisoo.
[00:42:31.890] [SPEAKER_01]：我们就像在你家一样，Jisoo。
[00:42:33.850] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. And then like no one brought
[00:42:33.850] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊。然后就好像没人带东西来一样。
[00:42:35.770] [SPEAKER_01]: jackets. And so now you're just handing out jackets from your closet.
[00:42:35.770] [SPEAKER_01]：外套。所以现在你就是从衣柜里拿出外套来分发了。
[00:42:40.410] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, if it's like a bulk like jacket donation, I think it's fine.
[00:42:40.410] [SPEAKER_03]：好的，如果是像捐赠外套那样的大宗捐赠，我觉得没问题。
[00:42:45.370] [SPEAKER_03]: But then why would she not wear my jacket?
[00:42:45.370] [SPEAKER_03]：可是她为什么不穿我的外套呢？
[00:42:49.190] [SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[00:42:49.190] [SPEAKER_01]：你明白我的意思吗？
[00:42:51.090] [SPEAKER_01]: Like my clothes are here too.
[00:42:51.090] [SPEAKER_01]：我的衣服也在这里。
[00:42:52.390] [SPEAKER_01]: How about both of them are getting handed out?
[00:42:52.390] [SPEAKER_01]：不如把它们两个都发放出去？
[00:42:54.910] [SPEAKER_01]: Like your clothes and Jisoo.
[00:42:54.910] [SPEAKER_01]：喜欢你的衣服和Jisoo。
[00:42:57.330] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, we all know this.
[00:42:57.330] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，我们都知道这一点。
[00:42:59.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Like boyfriend hoodies hit different though.
[00:42:59.310] [SPEAKER_00]：不过，男友风的连帽衫穿起来感觉就不一样了。
[00:43:02.310] [SPEAKER_03]: See, exactly.
[00:43:02.310] [SPEAKER_03]：你看，正是如此。
[00:43:03.630] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a boyfriend hoodie.
[00:43:03.630] [SPEAKER_03]：这是男友款连帽衫。
[00:43:04.630] [SPEAKER_03]: There's like meaning behind it, you know?
[00:43:04.630] [SPEAKER_03]：这背后是有含义的，你知道吗？
[00:43:07.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Or just comfort and practicality.
[00:43:07.390] [SPEAKER_00]：或者仅仅是舒适性和实用性。
[00:43:08.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But yes, there's also meaning behind it.
[00:43:08.890] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，是的，它背后也有含义。
[00:43:10.330] [SPEAKER_03]: No, dude, it's never a guy friend hoodie.
[00:43:10.330] [SPEAKER_03]: 不，兄弟，那绝不是男性朋友的连帽衫。
[00:43:12.530] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like boyfriend hoodie.
[00:43:12.530] [SPEAKER_03]：就像男友款连帽衫。
[00:43:13.930] [SPEAKER_00]: I give all my girl space friends my hoodies.
[00:43:13.930] [SPEAKER_00]: 我把我的连帽衫送给我所有的女性朋友。
[00:43:17.590] [SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.
[00:43:17.590] [SPEAKER_00]：我知道，我知道。
[00:43:19.250] [SPEAKER_03]: You're every boyfriend's public enemy number one.
[00:43:19.250] [SPEAKER_03]：你是所有男朋友的头号公敌。
[00:43:22.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I am a nightmare.
[00:43:22.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我简直就是个噩梦。
[00:43:23.970] [SPEAKER_00]: I am a problem.
[00:43:23.970] [SPEAKER_00]：我是一个问题。
[00:43:27.050] [SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like again, it's like the like again, back to the bigger person
[00:43:27.050] [SPEAKER_00]：但我感觉，这又回到了老一套，还是得看他更宽容大度。
[00:43:31.270] [SPEAKER_00]: thing, I don't ever do any such shit because I don't want to do any such shit.
[00:43:31.270] [SPEAKER_00]：这种事，我从来不做，因为我不想做。
[00:43:35.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:43:35.890] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。
[00:43:36.070] [SPEAKER_00]: And like there are like the boundaries where it's like my friend is dating
[00:43:36.070] [SPEAKER_00]：而且就像，这里面存在一些界限，比如我的朋友正在约会
[00:43:40.350] [SPEAKER_00]: someone, she's not sleeping over ever.
[00:43:40.350] [SPEAKER_00]：有人，她永远不会在你家过夜。
[00:43:42.930] [SPEAKER_00]: If she was single, maybe she'd sleep over if it's convenient.
[00:43:42.930] [SPEAKER_00]：如果她是单身，如果方便的话，也许会留宿。
[00:43:45.450] [SPEAKER_00]: But like I am aware of the optics for those things.
[00:43:45.450] [SPEAKER_00]：但我很清楚这些事情在舆论上的影响。
[00:43:49.090] [SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to stuff like
[00:43:49.090] [SPEAKER_00]：但说到这类事情，
[00:43:50.390] [SPEAKER_00]: the jacket stuff or the perilla leaf stuff, I feel like it's almost
[00:43:50.390] [SPEAKER_00]：夹克衫的那些东西或者紫苏叶的那些东西，我觉得几乎
[00:43:55.230] [SPEAKER_00]: better to normalize it to a certain extent.
[00:43:55.230] [SPEAKER_00]：最好在一定程度上进行规范化处理。
[00:43:57.930] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[00:43:57.930] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道吗？
[00:43:58.430] [SPEAKER_00]: It's also because I'm dealing with guys.
[00:43:58.430] [SPEAKER_00]：也因为我接触的都是男性。
[00:43:59.510] [SPEAKER_00]: You guys are dealing with girls, right?
[00:43:59.510] [SPEAKER_00]：你们是在和女孩打交道，对吧？
[00:44:02.310] [SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like for a guy, it's easier for the girl to be like
[00:44:02.310] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我觉得对男生来说，女生更容易像这样
[00:44:05.410] [SPEAKER_00]: for my friend who is the girl to be like, hey, obviously nothing is
[00:44:05.410] [SPEAKER_00]：对于我那个女孩朋友来说，她会说，嘿，显然没什么事是
[00:44:09.510] [SPEAKER_00]: weird, you're being weird.
[00:44:09.510] [SPEAKER_00]：真奇怪，你很奇怪。
[00:44:10.270] [SPEAKER_00]: And the guy has to just take that.
[00:44:10.270] [SPEAKER_00]：那家伙只能默默承受。
[00:44:12.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:44:12.610] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:44:13.190] [SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like with the jacket thing,
[00:44:13.190] [SPEAKER_03]：我只是觉得，关于外套这件事，
[00:44:15.390] [SPEAKER_03]: I could give my jacket to her and then I could wear my SO's jacket.
[00:44:15.390] [SPEAKER_03]：我可以把我的外套给她，然后我就可以穿我伴侣的外套了。
[00:44:19.150] [SPEAKER_03]: Like there's like workarounds, you know what I mean?
[00:44:19.150] [SPEAKER_03]：就像有一些变通方法一样，你明白我的意思吗？
[00:44:22.190] [SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.
[00:44:22.190] [SPEAKER_03]：这很公平。
[00:44:22.430] [SPEAKER_00]: But that's like an extra jacket pass.
[00:44:22.430] [SPEAKER_00]：但这就像一张额外的外套通行证。
[00:44:25.550] [SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[00:44:25.550] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。
[00:44:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is right.
[00:44:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]：我的意思是，这才是正确的。
[00:44:27.490] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying.
[00:44:27.490] [SPEAKER_00]：我只是说说而已。
[00:44:28.290] [SPEAKER_00]: What if she was like 5'11", like hella tall and like your jacket doesn't fit her?
[00:44:28.290] [SPEAKER_00]：如果她身高 5 英尺 11 英寸（约 180 厘米），非常高，你的外套她穿不下怎么办？
[00:44:32.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:44:32.930] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，太疯狂了。
[00:44:34.630] [SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[00:44:34.630] [SPEAKER_01]：该死。
[00:44:35.410] [SPEAKER_01]: What if earlier in the night you're not cold yet?
[00:44:35.410] [SPEAKER_01]：如果晚上早些时候你还不觉得冷呢？
[00:44:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: So then your SO gives their jacket to someone else, but then you get cold.
[00:44:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]：然后你的伴侣把外套给了别人，结果你却冷了。
[00:44:44.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you allowed to take the jacket back?
[00:44:44.170] [SPEAKER_01]：比如说，你可以把外套拿回去吗？
[00:44:47.030] [SPEAKER_00]: That is insane.
[00:44:47.030] [SPEAKER_00]：这太疯狂了。
[00:44:48.970] [SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?
[00:44:48.970] [SPEAKER_03]：请问？
[00:44:49.590] [SPEAKER_03]: That's my man's jacket.
[00:44:49.590] [SPEAKER_03]：那是我男人的外套。
[00:44:51.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Can I get that back?
[00:44:51.190] [SPEAKER_03]：我能把那个要回来吗？
[00:44:53.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Your lease is up.
[00:44:53.130] [SPEAKER_00]：您的租约到期了。
[00:44:56.010] [SPEAKER_03]: Jacket eviction.
[00:44:56.010] [SPEAKER_03]：外套脱掉。
[00:44:58.070] [SPEAKER_03]: See, this is why it's just better to not do this shit at all.
[00:44:58.070] [SPEAKER_03]：你看，这就是为什么最好根本不要做这种蠢事。
[00:45:01.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's too complicated.
[00:45:01.510] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉太复杂了。
[00:45:02.930] [SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm like mad at this hypothetical situation.
[00:45:02.930] [SPEAKER_03]：现在我对这种假设的情况感到非常愤怒。
[00:45:07.010] Okay.
[00:45:07.010] 好的。
[00:45:07.630] [SPEAKER_01]: I think there should be a base here.
[00:45:07.630] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为这里应该有个基地。
[00:45:09.590] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're the one to lend out the jacket or whatever, and your SO does not
[00:45:09.590] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你是那个把外套或其他东西借出去的人，而你的另一半不……
[00:45:15.570] [SPEAKER_01]: have a jacket that night, then you should be prepared to lend it to them
[00:45:15.570] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你当晚带了外套，那就应该准备好借给他们。
[00:45:20.130] [SPEAKER_01]: over anyone else. Right?
[00:45:20.130] [SPEAKER_01]：胜过任何人。对吧？
[00:45:22.790] [SPEAKER_01]: But I guess if your SO already has a jacket and is prepared for that night,
[00:45:22.790] [SPEAKER_01]：不过我想，如果你的另一半已经有了外套，并且为当晚做好了准备，
[00:45:26.810] [SPEAKER_01]: then maybe it's slightly more okay to lend your jacket out.
[00:45:26.810] [SPEAKER_01]：那么，或许把外套借出去就稍微可以接受了。
[00:45:32.250] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a solution from the guy side, I guess, because I feel like this is
[00:45:32.250] [SPEAKER_00]：是的，我猜我从男性的角度有个解决方案，因为我觉得这是
[00:45:37.250] [SPEAKER_00]: more of a guy can fuck up here, right?
[00:45:37.250] [SPEAKER_00]：这里更多的人可能会犯错，对吧？
[00:45:40.290] [SPEAKER_00]: You wear two jackets, one for the friend, one for the SO.
[00:45:40.290] [SPEAKER_00]：你穿两件外套，一件给朋友，一件给另一半。
[00:45:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can layer up, look a little nice and stuff.
[00:45:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，你可以穿很多层衣服，让自己看起来漂亮一点什么的。
[00:45:47.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. But first jacket goes out, whoever needs it.
[00:45:47.670] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。但第一件外套会先发给需要的人。
[00:45:51.230] [SPEAKER_00]: But you have an emergency jacket if your SO needs it.
[00:45:51.230] [SPEAKER_00]：但是如果你的另一半需要的话，你有一件应急外套。
[00:45:54.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:45:54.330] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。
[00:45:55.130] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually like the not as thick layer.
[00:45:55.130] [SPEAKER_00]：而且通常是不太厚的那一层。
[00:45:58.610] [SPEAKER_00]: So you can also hug her and be like, oh, we're in this together type shit.
[00:45:58.610] [SPEAKER_00]：所以你也可以拥抱她，然后说，哦，我们一起面对这一切之类的话。
[00:46:02.030] [SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many ways to do this.
[00:46:02.030] [SPEAKER_00]：好像有很多方法可以做到这一点。
[00:46:03.590] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're just sweating all night, like bullets all night.
[00:46:03.590] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉就像你整晚都在冒汗，像子弹一样。
[00:46:08.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:46:08.130] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。哦，是啊。
[00:46:09.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm trying to treat you right.
[00:46:09.230] [SPEAKER_00]：嘿，我努力想好好待你。
[00:46:13.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I sacrifice for you.
[00:46:13.670] [SPEAKER_00]：我为你牺牲。
[00:46:16.390] [SPEAKER_01]: That one, I think is a little...
[00:46:16.390] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得那个有点……
[00:46:19.490] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't know. Like you specifically planned for another girl?
[00:46:19.490] [SPEAKER_01]：我不知道。就像你特意计划要找另一个女孩一样？
[00:46:23.050] [SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:23.050] [SPEAKER_00]：不，不，不，不，不。
[00:46:24.590] [SPEAKER_00]: You specifically planned. It could be a guy too.
[00:46:24.590] [SPEAKER_00]：这是你精心策划的。也可能是个男的。
[00:46:27.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I give my guy friends jackets.
[00:46:27.250] [SPEAKER_00]：我会送我的男性朋友夹克。
[00:46:28.310] [SPEAKER_00]: They usually say no because like, you know, toxic masculinity.
[00:46:28.310] [SPEAKER_00]：他们通常会拒绝，因为，你知道，这是有毒的男子气概作祟。
[00:46:31.210] [SPEAKER_00]: But I offer still either way.
[00:46:31.210] [SPEAKER_00]：但我还是会提供两种选择。
[00:46:34.210] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I think the idea here.
[00:46:34.210] [SPEAKER_01]: 我的意思是，我觉得这里的想法是这样的。
[00:46:36.470] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I guess you're right.
[00:46:36.470] [SPEAKER_01]：好吧，我想你是对的。
[00:46:37.450] [SPEAKER_01]: It could be another guy.
[00:46:37.450] [SPEAKER_01]：也可能是另一个人。
[00:46:38.550] [SPEAKER_01]: But if it was like another girl,
[00:46:38.550] [SPEAKER_01]：但如果她像另一个女孩一样，
[00:46:40.510] [SPEAKER_01]: it's the fact that they anticipated like giving away two jackets.
[00:46:40.510] [SPEAKER_01]：他们预料到会送出两件夹克衫。
[00:46:46.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Counter, counter objection.
[00:46:46.170] [SPEAKER_00]：反驳，反驳异议。
[00:46:48.810] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, if we're going out and it's
[00:46:48.810] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，如果我们要出去，而且是
[00:46:50.130] [SPEAKER_00]: like a bunch of guys, a bunch of girls or whatever.
[00:46:50.130] [SPEAKER_00]：就像一群男生，一群女生之类的。
[00:46:52.050] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Let's say I'm going out with my SO
[00:46:52.050] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。假设我和我的伴侣出去约会。
[00:46:53.910] [SPEAKER_00]: and also like some of my girlfriends, girl space friends.
[00:46:53.910] [SPEAKER_00]：还有我的一些女朋友，闺蜜。
[00:46:57.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:46:57.170] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。
[00:46:57.810] [SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times girls go out.
[00:46:57.810] [SPEAKER_00]：很多时候女孩子都会出去玩。
[00:46:59.430] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. You want to look good.
[00:46:59.430] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。你想让自己看起来很棒。
[00:47:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't bring the extra layer.
[00:47:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]：就像你没有带来额外的层次一样。
[00:47:02.230] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's crazy to me to be like, oh, one of them might need a jacket.
[00:47:02.230] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这样想并不疯狂，比如，哦，他们中的一个可能需要一件外套。
[00:47:06.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, but you're now literally Jacket Man.
[00:47:06.090] [SPEAKER_03]：老兄，你现在简直就是个“夹克男”了。
[00:47:08.990] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?
[00:47:08.990] [SPEAKER_03]：你知道我的意思吗？
[00:47:10.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And so what?
[00:47:10.190] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。那又怎样？
[00:47:12.750] [SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of jackets.
[00:47:12.750] [SPEAKER_00]：我有很多外套。
[00:47:14.310] [SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[00:47:14.310] [SPEAKER_00]：我还能说什么呢？
[00:47:15.270] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a better solution is you can tell your girl space friends.
[00:47:15.270] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为更好的办法是你可以告诉你的闺蜜们。
[00:47:19.670] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you guys should bring a jacket.
[00:47:19.670] [SPEAKER_01]：你们或许应该带件外套。
[00:47:21.230] [SPEAKER_01]: I can carry them for you.
[00:47:21.230] [SPEAKER_01]：我可以帮你拿。
[00:47:23.350] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[00:47:23.350] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，这个不错。
[00:47:24.370] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that.
[00:47:24.370] [SPEAKER_00]：我不想那样做。
[00:47:25.950] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, you already know I'm wearing two jackets.
[00:47:25.950] [SPEAKER_01]：嗯，你们都知道我穿了两件外套。
[00:47:28.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, no.
[00:47:28.890] [SPEAKER_00]：嗯，不，不。
[00:47:29.650] [SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like it'll be like a puffer and like a flannel.
[00:47:29.650] [SPEAKER_00]：它会像羽绒服和法兰绒一样。
[00:47:32.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it'll be like it'll look good.
[00:47:32.130] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，就像它会看起来很棒一样。
[00:47:34.630] [SPEAKER_00]: It'll look natural.
[00:47:34.630] [SPEAKER_00]：看起来很自然。
[00:47:36.150] [SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's like to see you,
[00:47:36.150] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，你知道，见到你就像，
[00:47:37.550] [SPEAKER_01]: Gina's like I can do it for another girl, but suddenly all these girls know
[00:47:37.550] [SPEAKER_01]：吉娜说我可以为另一个女孩做这件事，但突然间所有这些女孩都知道了。
[00:47:41.650] [SPEAKER_01]: like, well, I'll see the difference here.
[00:47:41.650] [SPEAKER_01]：嗯，我会看出其中的区别。
[00:47:43.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll carry my own jacket, too.
[00:47:43.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我也会带上自己的外套。
[00:47:45.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to like be like, I think it's weird to be like, oh,
[00:47:45.890] [SPEAKER_00]：但我不想那样，我觉得那样很奇怪，哦，
[00:47:48.490] [SPEAKER_00]: let me carry all the girls jackets.
[00:47:48.490] [SPEAKER_00]：让我来帮所有女孩拿外套。
[00:47:50.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me be the fucking basket for you to carry stuff in.
[00:47:50.390] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，让我来当你的提物篮吧。
[00:47:54.070] [SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what you're volunteering to do without telling them by bringing
[00:47:54.070] [SPEAKER_01]：这有点像你没告诉他们就主动去做的事，你带着这些东西来。
[00:47:58.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I am prepared for whatever.
[00:47:58.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我已经做好了应对一切的准备。
[00:48:01.310] [SPEAKER_00]: I am preparing myself for anything that can happen.
[00:48:01.310] [SPEAKER_00]：我正在为可能发生的一切做好准备。
[00:48:04.230] [SPEAKER_03]: But it's like I want my man to just be prepared for me at the end of the day.
[00:48:04.230] [SPEAKER_03]：但我只是希望我的男人在一天结束时能为我做好准备。
[00:48:08.350] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm prepared for all my friends and also my SO, but also all my friends.
[00:48:08.350] [SPEAKER_00]：我已经为我的所有朋友和我的伴侣做好了准备，但我也为我的所有朋友做好了准备。
[00:48:14.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[00:48:14.330] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，好的。
[00:48:14.710] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, back to the thing.
[00:48:14.710] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，回到正题。
[00:48:15.990] [SPEAKER_00]: I was like, how if it's like my lifelong
[00:48:15.990] [SPEAKER_00]：我当时想，如果这就像我一生的……
[00:48:18.930] [SPEAKER_00]: friends, someone who I trust more than my SO, I don't feel good about like
[00:48:18.930] [SPEAKER_00]：朋友，我比伴侣更信任的人，我对他们感觉不太好。
[00:48:25.010] [SPEAKER_00]: preparing for my SO when if I was single, I would prepare for my friends.
[00:48:25.010] [SPEAKER_00]：如果我是单身，我会为朋友准备，而现在我会为我的另一半准备。
[00:48:28.790] [SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense, I would try to have I would try to consider both at least.
[00:48:28.790] [SPEAKER_00]：如果这样说得通的话，我会尽量考虑至少这两方面。
[00:48:33.830] [SPEAKER_03]: I think it does make sense, but I feel like there is a line where
[00:48:33.830] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这有道理，但我觉得这其中应该有个界限。
[00:48:36.630] [SPEAKER_03]: at a certain point you're like maybe potentially overstepping.
[00:48:36.630] [SPEAKER_03]：到了某个时候，你可能就有点越界了。
[00:48:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:48:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，是的，当然。
[00:48:41.670] [SPEAKER_03]: If your friend had an SO and he was
[00:48:41.670] [SPEAKER_03]：如果你的朋友有伴侣，而他
[00:48:44.470] [SPEAKER_03]: uncomfortable with that, like you would maybe stop.
[00:48:44.470] [SPEAKER_03]：对此感到不舒服，就像你可能会停下来一样。
[00:48:47.250] [SPEAKER_03]: Right. But what if it's like the same thing, but inverse,
[00:48:47.250] [SPEAKER_03]：没错。但如果情况正好相反呢？
[00:48:49.770] [SPEAKER_03]: like your SO might be uncomfortable with it.
[00:48:49.770] [SPEAKER_03]：比如你的伴侣可能会对此感到不舒服。
[00:48:52.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you stop?
[00:48:52.190] [SPEAKER_03]：你能停下来吗？
[00:48:53.890] [SPEAKER_00]: If my SO was uncomfortable with me giving out jackets?
[00:48:53.890] [SPEAKER_00]：如果我的伴侣觉得我送外套不自在呢？
[00:48:55.990] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:48:55.990] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:48:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Like in that situation. OK, let me sorry.
[00:48:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]：就像那种情况一样。好的，我道歉。
[00:48:58.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Let me be clear. I've never done this.
[00:48:58.370] [SPEAKER_00]：我澄清一下，我从未做过这种事。
[00:49:01.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I never do.
[00:49:01.310] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我从来没做过的那样。
[00:49:02.170] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe you.
[00:49:02.170] [SPEAKER_00]：我不相信你。
[00:49:03.130] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, I do.
[00:49:03.130] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，我同意。
[00:49:05.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Plans in action.
[00:49:05.170] [SPEAKER_01]：计划正在实施。
[00:49:06.990] [SPEAKER_00]: No, OK.
[00:49:06.990] [SPEAKER_00]：不，好的。
[00:49:07.950] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have like the the concert situation, right?
[00:49:07.950] [SPEAKER_00]：嗯，我喜欢演唱会那种氛围，对吧？
[00:49:10.870] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if I'm walking two girl space friends home, then I'll bring out where
[00:49:10.870] [SPEAKER_00]：比如，如果我送两个女太空朋友回家，那我就会带她们出去。
[00:49:14.790] [SPEAKER_00]: double jackets in case they both want a jacket.
[00:49:14.790] [SPEAKER_00]：准备两件外套，以防他们俩都想要一件外套。
[00:49:17.310] [SPEAKER_00]: But I've never had a case where I had to like choose between my SL and my
[00:49:17.310] [SPEAKER_00]：但我从来没有遇到过需要在我的SL和我的……之间做出选择的情况。
[00:49:20.110] [SPEAKER_03]: friends. Oh, I see.
[00:49:20.110] [SPEAKER_03]：朋友们。哦，我明白了。
[00:49:22.190] [SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't prepare that.
[00:49:22.190] [SPEAKER_00]：我并没有准备那个。
[00:49:24.590] [SPEAKER_00]: But but I think points still stands to an extent.
[00:49:24.590] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，我认为这些观点在某种程度上仍然成立。
[00:49:29.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I just think that like there is a way to how do I say there?
[00:49:29.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我只是觉得，好像有一种方法可以……该怎么说呢？
[00:49:33.190] [SPEAKER_00]: There has to be some way to look out for your friends or like if your
[00:49:33.190] [SPEAKER_00]：总得有办法照顾你的朋友，或者如果你……
[00:49:38.110] [SPEAKER_00]: friend needs something like a jacket, you can be able to offer it.
[00:49:38.110] [SPEAKER_00]: 朋友需要一件外套之类的东西，你可以提供给他。
[00:49:42.850] [SPEAKER_00]: But not in a way that's like you're doing it because your SO isn't like there's
[00:49:42.850] [SPEAKER_00]：但不是因为你的伴侣不喜欢你才这么做的那种方式。
[00:49:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]: all factors. Right.
[00:49:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]：所有因素。没错。
[00:49:48.590] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, if all your friends are going out and like, you know, we're all going
[00:49:48.590] [SPEAKER_00]：再说一遍，如果你的朋友们都出去玩，你知道，我们也要出去玩。
[00:49:51.990] [SPEAKER_00]: to be cold than like I will be prepared to get my SO my jacket.
[00:49:51.990] [SPEAKER_00]：比起冷，我会准备好把我的外套给我的另一半。
[00:49:57.490] [SPEAKER_00]: I will also prepare potentially for one of my friends.
[00:49:57.490] [SPEAKER_00]：我可能还会为我的一个朋友做准备。
[00:50:00.090] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, I'm not going to neglect my SO.
[00:50:00.090] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，你知道，我不会冷落我的另一半。
[00:50:04.230] [SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[00:50:04.230] [SPEAKER_03]：有意思。
[00:50:04.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Jesus doesn't. Am I the bad guy here?
[00:50:04.670] [SPEAKER_03]：耶稣不会这么做。难道我是坏人吗？
[00:50:07.950] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like two sides of the jacket spectrum.
[00:50:07.950] [SPEAKER_03]：这就好比是夹克衫光谱的两端。
[00:50:11.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I think ultimately, though, it's just that like you probably want to be
[00:50:11.190] [SPEAKER_01]：不过，我觉得最终，这可能就像你想成为……
[00:50:16.910] [SPEAKER_01]: more prepared for your SO, I guess, versus anyone else.
[00:50:16.910] [SPEAKER_01]：我想，你比对待其他人更能照顾你的另一半吧。
[00:50:21.730] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are you responsible for everyone else?
[00:50:21.730] [SPEAKER_01]：比如，你为什么要对其他人负责？
[00:50:25.130] [SPEAKER_00]: That is also true. Yes, I agree.
[00:50:25.130] [SPEAKER_00]：确实如此。是的，我同意。
[00:50:27.050] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess like the best situation would be your SO notices some other girl is
[00:50:27.050] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得最好的情况就是你的另一半注意到有别的女孩
[00:50:32.740] [SPEAKER_01]: cold and she's like, hey, you should lend her your jacket.
[00:50:32.740] [SPEAKER_01]：她觉得冷，然后说，嘿，你应该把你的外套借给她。
[00:50:35.880] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that happens a lot too, right?
[00:50:35.880] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，这种情况也经常发生，对吧？
[00:50:37.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's like very.
[00:50:37.580] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我觉得这非常。
[00:50:39.100] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's like perfectly fine.
[00:50:39.100] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，那完全没问题。
[00:50:42.840] [SPEAKER_00]: So is it worse if she doesn't say that and you do it without her?
[00:50:42.840] [SPEAKER_00]：如果她不说，而你瞒着她做了，情况会不会更糟？
[00:50:46.140] [SPEAKER_00]: Like what if she was just going to say it, but then you do it first?
[00:50:46.140] [SPEAKER_00]：比如说，如果她正要说，结果你抢先说了呢？
[00:50:48.960] [SPEAKER_00]: Does that feel weird? Yeah.
[00:50:48.960] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉怪怪的吗？是的。
[00:50:52.340] [SPEAKER_01]: The instant yes.
[00:50:52.340] [SPEAKER_01]：立刻答应。
[00:50:55.610] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm just talking about preferences here.
[00:50:55.610] [SPEAKER_03]：好的，我只是在谈论个人偏好。
[00:50:57.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying my guy would be like banned or restricted.
[00:50:57.730] [SPEAKER_03]：我不是说我的人会被禁赛或限制参赛。
[00:51:00.790] [SPEAKER_03]: It's just like what I prefer for him to not always be like looking out
[00:51:00.790] [SPEAKER_03]：我更希望他不要总是像个守株待兔的人。
[00:51:06.090] [SPEAKER_03]: for the cold women in the crowd, like probably.
[00:51:06.090] [SPEAKER_03]：对于人群中那些冷漠的女性来说，大概是这样。
[00:51:08.690] [SPEAKER_00]: He respects women.
[00:51:08.690] [SPEAKER_00]：他尊重女性。
[00:51:09.950] [SPEAKER_00]: What a good guy.
[00:51:09.950] [SPEAKER_00]：真是个好人。
[00:51:12.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I like that guy.
[00:51:12.830] [SPEAKER_00]：我喜欢那家伙。
[00:51:14.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Bro's a walking thermometer.
[00:51:14.590] [SPEAKER_01]：兄弟简直就是个行走的温度计。
[00:51:16.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, he's tapped in.
[00:51:16.630] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，伙计，他已经连上了。
[00:51:19.170] [SPEAKER_01]: He's wearing five jackets for every girl in the group.
[00:51:19.170] [SPEAKER_01]：他穿了五件外套，相当于组合里每个女孩五件。
[00:51:22.430] [SPEAKER_00]: He got the ultra light down in his pockets, like, dude, he's ready.
[00:51:22.430] [SPEAKER_00]: 他把超轻型枪放进口袋里，就像，老兄，他准备好了。
[00:51:27.330] [SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Jesus, check these out.
[00:51:27.330] [SPEAKER_01]：他就像，我的天，看看这些。
[00:51:28.810] [SPEAKER_01]: I bought these zip up jackets for him.
[00:51:28.810] [SPEAKER_01]：我给他买了这些拉链外套。
[00:51:32.530] [SPEAKER_01]: His cargo pants are like filled.
[00:51:32.530] [SPEAKER_01]：他的工装裤好像被撑满了。
[00:51:37.090] [SPEAKER_00]: What a prepared man.
[00:51:37.090] [SPEAKER_00]：真是个准备充分的人。
[00:51:40.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think for me, like to wrap it all up, I am probably not super bothered
[00:51:40.170] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我觉得对我来说，总而言之，我可能不太在意。
[00:51:45.930] [SPEAKER_01]: by it, but if like the jacket were to go out to someone else and I might need
[00:51:45.930] [SPEAKER_01]：不过，如果这件外套要送给别人，而我又需要的话……
[00:51:50.970] [SPEAKER_01]: it later, then that's like kind of a kind of a no.
[00:51:50.970] [SPEAKER_01]：如果以后再说，那就相当于一种拒绝。
[00:51:55.070] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And that's why you bring two jackets.
[00:51:55.070] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。所以你才要带两件外套。
[00:51:59.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying.
[00:51:59.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我只是说说而已。
[00:52:02.350] [SPEAKER_01]: All right, I have a final question for us all.
[00:52:02.350] [SPEAKER_01]：好的，我还有一个问题要问大家。
[00:52:05.270] [SPEAKER_01]: What is something that's maybe kind of specific or niche that you would consider
[00:52:05.270] [SPEAKER_01]：您认为有哪些比较具体或小众的东西值得考虑？
[00:52:10.770] [SPEAKER_01]: like towing the line, you know, something that's like not great behavior?
[00:52:10.770] [SPEAKER_01]：就像循规蹈矩一样，你知道，那种不太好的行为？
[00:52:16.090] [SPEAKER_00]: If my SO is doing something with someone else, like another guy that she doesn't
[00:52:16.090] [SPEAKER_00]：如果我的伴侣和别人在一起，比如和她不认识的另一个男人在一起，那我该怎么办？
[00:52:23.190] [SPEAKER_00]: do with me, but it's like something that I like doing.
[00:52:23.190] [SPEAKER_00]：随我便，但这就像是我喜欢做的事情。
[00:52:27.450] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[00:52:27.450] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，是的。
[00:52:29.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a concrete example, but like, I don't know, something similar has
[00:52:29.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我没有具体的例子，但是，我不知道，类似的事情……
[00:52:33.370] [SPEAKER_00]: happened before where it's like, oh, maybe like I like going to a certain type
[00:52:33.370] [SPEAKER_00]：以前也发生过这种情况，比如，哦，也许我喜欢去某种特定的地方。
[00:52:37.050] [SPEAKER_00]: of concert and she is like, oh, she's not into it.
[00:52:37.050] [SPEAKER_00]：演唱会，她却说，哦，她没兴趣。
[00:52:40.290] [SPEAKER_00]: So she doesn't go.
[00:52:40.290] [SPEAKER_00]：所以她不去。
[00:52:41.170] [SPEAKER_00]: But she does go with someone else.
[00:52:41.170] [SPEAKER_00]：但她确实和别人一起走了。
[00:52:42.890] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I thought you weren't about that shit.
[00:52:42.890] [SPEAKER_00]: 我以为你不会做那种事呢。
[00:52:45.430] [SPEAKER_00]: What happened? You know, that's a good one.
[00:52:45.430] [SPEAKER_00]：发生了什么事？你知道，这可是个好问题。
[00:52:48.430] [SPEAKER_01]: Mine's kind of more generic.
[00:52:48.430] [SPEAKER_01]：我的比较通用。
[00:52:51.570] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if maybe you're at some social gathering or an event or whatever,
[00:52:51.570] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得如果你在参加某个社交聚会、活动或其他什么场合，
[00:52:58.810] [SPEAKER_01]: and then your SO is busy talking with someone else the whole time.
[00:52:58.810] [SPEAKER_01]：然后你的另一半却一直在和别人聊天。
[00:53:03.670] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[00:53:03.670] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，这个不错。
[00:53:06.530] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[00:53:06.530] [SPEAKER_03]：好的。
[00:53:06.730] [SPEAKER_03]: Mine is maybe kind of silly, but I think
[00:53:06.730] [SPEAKER_03]：我的想法可能有点傻，但我认为
[00:53:10.750] [SPEAKER_03]: if your SO is carpooling with someone a lot and it's just one on one
[00:53:10.750] [SPEAKER_03]：如果你的伴侣经常和别人拼车，而且每次都是一对一的。
[00:53:15.070] [SPEAKER_03]: specifically, kind of sus.
[00:53:15.070] [SPEAKER_03]：具体来说，有点可疑。
[00:53:17.930] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[00:53:17.930] [SPEAKER_01]：好的。
[00:53:18.470] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is also very applicable
[00:53:18.470] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得这也很适用。
[00:53:20.310] [SPEAKER_01]: to you because I know you enjoy being passenger princess.
[00:53:20.310] [SPEAKER_01]：给你，因为我知道你喜欢当乘客公主。
[00:53:24.350] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[00:53:24.350] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，我的天哪。
[00:53:25.950] [SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[00:53:25.950] [SPEAKER_00]：确实如此。
[00:53:27.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that?
[00:53:27.810] [SPEAKER_00]：你能解释一下吗？
[00:53:29.930] [SPEAKER_00]: How do you what do you mean you enjoy being passenger princess?
[00:53:29.930] [SPEAKER_00]：你是什么意思？你说你喜欢当乘客公主？
[00:53:34.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Like Jisoo prefers not to drive.
[00:53:34.470] [SPEAKER_01]：就像 Jisoo 不喜欢开车一样。
[00:53:37.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that it? Okay.
[00:53:37.130] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，就这些吗？好的。
[00:53:38.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:53:38.450] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。
[00:53:39.010] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's like if her SO is specifically not driving Jisoo,
[00:53:39.010] [SPEAKER_01]：所以就好像如果她的伴侣特意不开车送Jisoo，
[00:53:43.950] [SPEAKER_01]: who is he? Like, why is he not driving Jisoo?
[00:53:43.950] [SPEAKER_01]：他是谁？他为什么不开车送Jisoo？
[00:53:45.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, why is someone else taking her spot?
[00:53:45.870] [SPEAKER_01]：为什么有人要取代她的位置？
[00:53:49.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. There's another passenger princess.
[00:53:49.130] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。还有一位女乘客。
[00:53:51.050] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not you.
[00:53:51.050] [SPEAKER_00]：那不是你。
[00:53:52.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[00:53:52.130] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:53:53.010] [SPEAKER_03]: Why my passenger princess number one?
[00:53:53.010] [SPEAKER_03]：为什么我的乘客公主是头号？
[00:53:55.430] [SPEAKER_03]: I should be like the only passenger princess.
[00:53:55.430] [SPEAKER_03]：我应该像唯一的乘客公主一样。
[00:53:58.730] [SPEAKER_00]: What if wait, okay.
[00:53:58.730] [SPEAKER_00]：等等，好吗？
[00:53:59.790] [SPEAKER_00]: What if he is passenger princess to someone else a lot?
[00:53:59.790] [SPEAKER_00]：如果他经常是别人的乘客公主呢？
[00:54:05.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's fine.
[00:54:05.730] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得没问题。
[00:54:06.670] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think for the most part,
[00:54:06.670] [SPEAKER_03]：但我认为在大多数情况下，
[00:54:09.350] [SPEAKER_03]: like, I would prefer to be carpooling with my SO.
[00:54:09.350] [SPEAKER_03]：比如，我更喜欢和我的伴侣拼车。
[00:54:13.950] [SPEAKER_03]: So then if there's some situation where my SO is always carpooling with someone,
[00:54:13.950] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，如果我的伴侣总是和别人拼车，
[00:54:21.010] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it would be a little weird.
[00:54:21.010] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这会有点奇怪。
[00:54:22.990] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait.
[00:54:22.990] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，等等。
[00:54:23.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Also, I guess if your SO is being the passenger princess to someone else,
[00:54:23.470] [SPEAKER_01]：还有，我想如果你的另一半在别人面前扮演公主乘客的角色，
[00:54:28.750] [SPEAKER_01]: you should also be there.
[00:54:28.750] [SPEAKER_01]：你也应该到场。
[00:54:30.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[00:54:30.710] [SPEAKER_01]：是的。
[00:54:31.010] [SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck am I?
[00:54:31.010] [SPEAKER_01]：我他妈在哪儿？
[00:54:33.590] [SPEAKER_00]: What if they care about the planet?
[00:54:33.590] [SPEAKER_00]：如果他们关心地球呢？
[00:54:36.850] [SPEAKER_00]: They are coworkers.
[00:54:36.850] [SPEAKER_00]：他们是同事。
[00:54:38.690] [SPEAKER_00]: Hey, like HOV lane.
[00:54:38.690] [SPEAKER_00]：嘿，就像高乘载车道一样。
[00:54:40.090] [SPEAKER_00]: It is three plus now.
[00:54:40.090] [SPEAKER_00]：现在已经三点多了。
[00:54:41.850] [SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day when it wasn't three plus, right?
[00:54:41.850] [SPEAKER_00]：以前还没有三岁以上这个限制，对吧？
[00:54:45.010] [SPEAKER_01]: It's invalid now.
[00:54:45.010] [SPEAKER_01]：现在无效了。
[00:54:47.210] [SPEAKER_00]: In 2009.
[00:54:47.210] [SPEAKER_00]：2009 年。
[00:54:48.270] [SPEAKER_00]: We're in 2009 right now.
[00:54:48.270] [SPEAKER_00]：现在是2009年。
[00:54:50.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[00:54:50.370] [SPEAKER_00]：好的。
[00:54:50.890] [SPEAKER_00]: And they go to work together and she drives them every day.
[00:54:50.890] [SPEAKER_00]：他们一起上班，她每天开车送他们。
[00:54:55.250] [SPEAKER_03]: 2009, bro, we're 13.
[00:54:55.250] [SPEAKER_03]: 2009年，兄弟，我们才13岁。
[00:54:57.870] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[00:54:57.870] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道吗？
[00:54:58.970] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[00:54:58.970] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道吗？
[00:54:59.710] [SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[00:54:59.710] [SPEAKER_00]：说得有道理。
[00:55:01.530] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no retort for that point.
[00:55:01.530] [SPEAKER_00]：是的，对此我无话可说。
[00:55:04.210] [SPEAKER_00]: That is really correct.
[00:55:04.210] [SPEAKER_00]：确实如此。
[00:55:06.170] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like my learning from all of this is we all have very different
[00:55:06.170] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得我从这一切中学到的是，我们每个人都有非常不同的经历。
[00:55:11.190] [SPEAKER_03]: lines of what's okay and what's not.
[00:55:11.190] [SPEAKER_03]：界定什么是可以接受的，什么是不可以接受的。
[00:55:13.590] [SPEAKER_03]: So it was really funny for me to hear our various takes on the jacket stuff,
[00:55:13.590] [SPEAKER_03]：听到大家对夹克衫的各种看法，我觉得很有趣。
[00:55:18.290] [SPEAKER_03]: the perl leaf stuff and everything in between.
[00:55:18.290] [SPEAKER_03]：关于 perl leaf 以及介于两者之间的一切。
[00:55:22.150] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think ultimately, it's just that you have to communicate these boundaries
[00:55:22.150] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为归根结底，就是你必须把这些界限沟通清楚。
[00:55:25.670] [SPEAKER_01]: to your SO, so no matter your preference, as long as you both are
[00:55:25.670] [SPEAKER_01]：对你的伴侣来说，无论你的偏好如何，只要你们双方都……
[00:55:30.270] [SPEAKER_01]: on the same page and it's been communicated, then there's definitely work around.
[00:55:30.270] [SPEAKER_01]：如果大家意见一致，并且已经沟通过了，那么肯定有解决办法。
[00:55:35.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to buy less jackets.
[00:55:35.830] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得你应该少买些外套。
[00:55:40.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Eugene, for coming on today to talk through all of these various
