[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Jimmy. I'm Eddie So we're back to talk about breakups There's still a lot we have a lot left on our outline to talk about. The doc is quite long
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Jimmy。我是Eddie。我们又回来聊分手了。我们还有很多内容要讲，还有很多东西没讲完。这个播客挺长的。
[00:00:25.150] The Google Doc I'm looking at. It's a two pager. Yeah So, let's just jump into it. First question. Do you think there's an ideal way to handle a breakup? I have an ideal way Well one thing I Helped a lot was going to the gym
[00:00:25.150] 我正在看的这份谷歌文档只有两页。好的，那我们就直接进入正题吧。第一个问题，你觉得处理分手有理想的方法吗？我倒是有一个理想的方法。我觉得很有帮助的一件事就是去健身房。
[00:00:41.710] I feel like there's a whole like subset of like memes right now about breaking up and then No, I actually don't send it to you as much I send it to people I actually go to the gym I'm not
[00:00:41.710] 我觉得现在有很多关于分手的梗图，然后……不，其实我没怎么给你发，我发给别人的更多。我真的会去健身房，我不是。
[00:01:02.390] But it's like it's like a whole subset where it's like this gym bro was born because It is like I feel like that definitely helped me a lot and obviously this is kind of like a very surface level way to
[00:01:02.390] 但这就像是一个独立的子集，就像健身达人这个群体诞生了一样，因为我觉得这确实对我的帮助很大，当然，这只是一种非常肤浅的理解。
[00:01:13.070] Do it. Well, I do think it's a form of like working on yourself like self-improvement And it makes you feel like you're progressing in something and gives you something to focus on use you some goals So I feel like that helped me a lot
[00:01:13.070] 去做吧。嗯，我觉得这算是一种自我提升，一种自我完善的方式。它能让你感觉自己在某个方面有所进步，也能给你一些专注的目标和方向。所以我觉得这对我很有帮助。
[00:01:24.910] I'm not like the biggest person, but I feel like I've made some like gains, you know this year So like I feel pretty good about that Bro, dude, I'm so ready to post the before and after pictures
[00:01:24.910] 我身材不算特别魁梧，但感觉今年确实进步了不少，你知道吗？所以，我对自己的身材很满意，兄弟，我已经迫不及待地想发前后对比照了。
[00:01:35.430] Cuz I was fucking I let myself go. I was skinny as shit Like I was not I did not feel or look good. Yeah, I feel like I'm a lot more confident myself now
[00:01:35.430] 因为我当时太放纵自己了。我瘦得跟竹竿似的，感觉自己一点也不好，看起来也不好看。不过，我现在感觉自信多了。
[00:01:43.510] So that's definitely playing like a big role. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I mean if you look at him from the back You see that, you know I For all the single ladies out there Jimmy likes my back
[00:01:43.510] 所以这肯定起了很大作用。是啊。是啊，你知道，我的意思是，如果你从后面看他，你会看到，你知道，我……（致所有单身女士：吉米喜欢我的背影）
[00:02:00.790] He's copping a feel, you know, yeah, I think that's a good one also exercise is supposed to like give you endorphins So do I think I think my body kind of changed after working all irregularly cuz I feel like I sweat more It's like not good changes. I'm
[00:02:00.790] 他这是在摸我，你知道，是啊，我觉得这挺好的。运动应该能让人分泌内啡肽，所以我觉得我的身体在不规律的工作后发生了一些变化，因为我感觉我更容易出汗了。这可不是什么好的变化。
[00:02:14.910] Maybe like testosterone or something. I'm going like more body hair and shit. Oh, dude testosterone. Yeah, like Okay, so it's not like it's not You know, like I had like a few before my brother for example, he's four years younger
[00:02:14.910] 可能是睾酮之类的吧。我感觉体毛好像多了点。哦，老兄，睾酮。对，就像……好吧，所以这并不是说……你知道，比如我弟弟，他比我小四岁，我以前也长过几次。
[00:02:37.190] He has a lot of chest hair straight up like chest hair I So he has a lot I was like roasted in front of you know, cuz it looks like ugly he has to like shaving
[00:02:37.190] 他胸毛特别多，直挺挺的，特别浓密。我当时就被他嘲笑了，因为看起来很丑，他肯定得刮掉。
[00:02:54.070] so I was like, you know, it's something I always made fun of him for and then Recently, I've noticed like I've been like it's not like that but like a few like more strands, you know
[00:02:54.070] 所以我就想，你知道，我以前总是拿这个取笑他，但最近我发现，好像不是那样了，而是多了些头发，你知道的。
[00:03:03.430] My body going through changes bro. Do you have more facial hair now too? Yeah, you're gonna grow your facial hair I mean like the testosterone back. Okay. No, so I
[00:03:03.430] 兄弟，我的身体正在发生变化。你现在脸上的毛发也变多了吗？是啊，你的胡子会长出来的，我是说睾酮水平恢复了。好的。不，所以……
[00:03:13.230] Have noticed like I feel like my beard goes up like a little higher almost to like my cheekbone sometimes So that's like inconvenient. I don't like that before it was like patchy to like my mid jaw
[00:03:13.230] 我注意到我的胡子好像长得更高了，有时候都快到颧骨了，这有点不方便。我不喜欢这样，以前胡子长得稀疏，只到下巴中间。
[00:03:23.810] No, it's like patchy all the way up to like my cheekbones. I don't like that bro My guess what here you might get some nipple hairs If you want your best friend to rub your back I don't think everybody
[00:03:23.810] 不，我的皮肤一直到颧骨都斑驳不均。我不喜欢这样，兄弟。我猜你这里可能会长出乳头毛。如果你想让你的好朋友帮你按摩背，我觉得不是每个人都愿意。
[00:03:53.470] Exercise in general is good though. Yeah, I think running is also a really good activity If you don't want to like hit the gym running is top five breakup activity. I
[00:03:53.470] 总的来说，运动是有益的。是的，我觉得跑步也是一项非常好的运动。如果你不想去健身房，跑步绝对是分手后最棒的五项运动之一。
[00:04:02.830] Will say though. I think that's like in general like a mentality right not being complacent. I feel like In a relationship a lot at the end like I feel like I was like pretty complacent with a lot of things
[00:04:02.830] 不过话说回来，我觉得这其实是一种心态，对吧？就是不要安于现状。我感觉在一段感情的最后，我常常会觉得自己对很多事情都太安于现状了。
[00:04:13.530] So it's a way to like kind of break out of that. You know what it is I think it's like filling the void, right? Yeah A huge part of your life is now gone. You gotta fill that up somehow, right?
[00:04:13.530] 所以这是一种摆脱困境的方式。你知道吗？我觉得这就像是填补空虚，对吧？是啊，你生命中很大一部分已经消失了。你得想办法填补它，对吧？
[00:04:23.730] Yeah, so many things are just filling up the void. Yeah Like I'm more extroverted now cuz like I got Yeah, yeah, they've been neglected for a little too long Exercising is one of the things that you can do by yourself and it's
[00:04:23.730] 是啊，很多事情都在填补内心的空虚。比如我现在更外向了，因为我……是啊，是啊，它们被忽视太久了。锻炼是你可以独自完成的事情之一，而且……
[00:04:43.210] If you really like going out to eat and stuff, it's always dependent on someone coming with you unless you're I'll be eating That is underrated I feel more people need to eat so No, I feel like it's a part of building out your new routine again
[00:04:43.210] 如果你真的很喜欢出去吃饭什么的，那总是得有人陪你，除非你自己也想吃。我觉得这一点被低估了，我觉得更多的人需要吃饭。不，我觉得这是重新建立新生活规律的一部分。
[00:05:00.330] Like there were things that you were so used to in your life when you had this partner and now it's like everything in your Schedules are free for all so workouts are like a good way to kind of patch that in. Yeah
[00:05:00.330] 就像以前有伴侣的时候，生活中有很多事情你都习惯了，现在你的日程安排完全自由了，所以锻炼就成了弥补这种空缺的好方法。是的。
[00:05:10.170] I really is just like getting hobbies and then talking to your friends again Yeah, and that's like the ideal way, right? Right? Yeah Like kind of just taking action and something and like not letting yourself just sit there in like too much pity because I feel like
[00:05:10.170] 我觉得，培养一些爱好，然后再和朋友们聊聊天，这才是理想的方式，对吧？对吧？就是采取一些行动，做点什么，不要让自己只是坐在那里自怜自艾，因为我觉得
[00:05:24.650] It's really easy like get stuck in your head Just be like wow, I'm so sad and then you don't do anything or like I'm so sad There's nothing to do and then that just ends up being pretty rough
[00:05:24.650] 很容易陷入这种情绪，比如一直想着“哇，我好难过”，然后什么也不做；或者觉得“我好难过，什么都做不了”，结果就变得很难熬。
[00:05:33.370] Yeah, cuz that's why I feel like a lot of people, you know reach out to their exes after breakups cuz like fucking low They got nothing yet. They got nothing going on at that time, you know
[00:05:33.370] 是啊，因为我觉得很多人分手后都会联系前任，因为他们太没品了，那时候他们什么都没有，你知道的。
[00:05:42.170] So you allow your yourself to like start thinking about the eggs and start, you know, like I'd be so much happier right now Right here, you know, I think you just like keep yourself busy and then yeah after that point like it just it's natural You know
[00:05:42.170] 所以你允许自己开始想鸡蛋，然后开始想，你知道，比如“我现在要是能待在这里就好了”，你知道，我觉得你只要让自己忙起来，然后，嗯，在那之后，一切就自然而然了，你知道的。
[00:05:54.810] What about people who dive really headfirst into like dating or sometimes not even dating, right? It's like people who really lean into the hooking up Well, I think everyone's entitled to a home Yeah, if you want to go
[00:05:54.810] 那么那些一头扎进约会，或者有时甚至不约会的人呢？就像那些热衷于一夜情的人一样。嗯，我认为每个人都有权利拥有一个家。是的，如果你想走的话。
[00:06:15.770] Everyone's entitled to you know have their fun. Oh, I'll just do it safely. I have a question Do you think there's like a refractory period where like you shouldn't? There's like a respectable amount of time before like, you know, maybe a little bit
[00:06:15.770] 每个人都有享受乐趣的权利。哦，我会注意安全的。我有个问题，你觉得是不是有个“不应期”，就是不应该这么做的那种？是不是在……之前会有一段相当长的时间，你知道，也许有点……
[00:06:30.610] What's like the rule of thumb is the rule of thumb I feel like at the absolute minimum like two weeks Oh I think that's to me. It's like there's like a External facing refractory period and an internal one internal one. I feel like maybe like two weeks
[00:06:30.610] 我觉得最起码需要两周时间。哦，我觉得是这样。感觉好像有外部不应期和内部不应期。我觉得大概需要两周。
[00:06:53.610] Then you can allow yourself to like stew over and then the end to stuff that could be like a distraction But externally it's probably longer right? Like I wouldn't want my ex to be like, oh
[00:06:53.610] 然后你可以让自己好好想想，最后把那些可能分散你注意力的事情都处理掉。但从表面上看，这个过程可能会更长，对吧？比如，我可不想让我的前任说，哦
[00:07:03.270] I'm with whoever right on social media like right after the breakup. Yeah, social media is crazy. Yeah Okay, but hear me out. I think that it should be a little longer because if you're like just sadly Hooking up with people. I think that I
[00:07:03.270] 我分手后立刻就在社交媒体上和任何人搞暧昧。是啊，社交媒体太疯狂了。好吧，但听我说完。我觉得应该再过一段时间，因为如果你只是可悲地和别人随便约炮。我觉得我
[00:07:40.070] Feel like let's say you're not totally Ready, maybe and you're just going on hooking up and then afterwards you're like wow That was kind of lame actually because this is so like meaningless Like I just hooked up with someone and now I'm just like empty feeling
[00:07:40.070] 感觉就像，比如说你还没完全准备好，只是随便约炮，事后你会觉得，哇，这其实挺无聊的，因为这毫无意义。就像我只是和某人约炮，现在却感觉空虚。
[00:07:54.270] I feel like if it's kind of that thing, right you just prolong your sadness That's true, or it could be a way of snapping you out of it and be like, oh wow. This is so pointless I should work on myself or I should look for something meaningful
[00:07:54.270] 我觉得如果真是那样，你只会延长自己的悲伤。没错，但也可能是一种让你从悲伤中清醒过来的方式，让你意识到：“哇，这太没意义了，我应该好好反省自己，或者应该寻找一些更有意义的事情。”
[00:08:08.590] Or it's just like claiming back that part of your life too, right? Yeah, you know because a lot of that intimacy used to be associated with your ex if you claim that back then
[00:08:08.590] 或者说，这就像是重新夺回你生命中的那一部分，对吧？是啊，你知道，因为如果你当时那样做，很多亲密关系都和你的前任有关。
[00:08:19.070] You know, you're not holding on to it or you're not reserving that part of yourself just for your ex It's like taking it back. Yeah That's a good way of putting it because I feel like a lot of the times it could lean into the territory of like
[00:08:19.070] 你知道，你不是执着于过去，也不是把那部分自我留给前任。这就像是把它收回来。嗯，这么说很贴切，因为我觉得很多时候它很容易变成……
[00:08:32.710] Replacing what you had with your ex of like, oh, I miss my ex So I'm gonna do try to replicate what I had with her with all these other Nameless people which just probably makes you feel shitty in the long run
[00:08:32.710] 试图用其他陌生人来取代你和前任之间的感情，比如，“哦，我想念我的前任，所以我打算尝试复制我和她之间的感觉”，但从长远来看，这很可能只会让你感觉糟糕。
[00:08:43.510] but if you think of it as like I am Taking this back and this is a part of my individuality part of my sexuality And just like owning that then I feel like it's a little bit more empowering. Yeah, I think it really just depends on the intent
[00:08:43.510] 但如果你把它想成是我在收回这些东西，这是我个性的一部分，是我性取向的一部分，并且我接受它，那么我觉得这会更有力量。是的，我认为这真的取决于意图。
[00:08:56.430] You know Yeah, if you're sad fucking If you got a boy you're filling over like being this shit, you know, then obviously that's bad But if you're in a generally good place and you just like, you know
[00:08:56.430] 你知道，如果你心情很糟，如果你有个男朋友，你却因为这种破事而对他耿耿于怀，那显然很糟糕。但如果你整体状态很好，只是……你知道
[00:09:12.030] You're you're trying you're doing something that you can't do before obviously. Yeah, I think that's healthy. That's true. That's true Yeah, I think it probably just depends on like each person's Threshold for like when they're ready. I also don't think there's anything wrong with
[00:09:12.030] 你正在尝试做一些你以前做不到的事情，这很正常。是的，我认为这很健康。没错。没错。是的，我认为这可能取决于每个人的阈值，也就是他们何时准备好。我也不认为这有什么错。
[00:09:27.950] Trying to go on dates because I think that's part of the healing process Like you're getting used to meeting new people again and like coming to terms with the idea that You could be you know
[00:09:27.950] 试着去约会，因为我觉得这是疗愈过程的一部分。就像你在重新习惯认识新朋友，也在慢慢接受“你可能会变成……你知道的”这个想法。
[00:09:38.410] Like with someone else and like, you know get to know them or just like that that whole concept So I think you know getting on the apps I guess Trying to go on some dates is definitely not necessarily like a bad thing
[00:09:38.410] 就像和别人约会一样，你知道，了解对方，或者就是那种感觉。所以我觉得，用约会软件去约会绝对不是什么坏事。
[00:09:59.030] Cuz I think also a lot of people who I know personally like after a long-term relationship breakup They're on the apps more to like feel it out. Not necessarily really like look for a new long-term relationship Yeah, I feel like that's you know, it's helpful you're like
[00:09:59.030] 因为我觉得我认识的很多人，在结束一段长期的恋爱关系后，用交友软件更多的是为了感受一下，而不是真的想找一段新的长期关系。嗯，我觉得这样挺有帮助的，你知道的。
[00:10:16.630] Yeah, it's like can I even physically meet new people true exactly so used to this one relationship But I will say it's kind of interesting because I feel like there is a certain element of like politics to post breakup
[00:10:16.630] 是啊，感觉就像我还能认识新朋友一样，真的，太习惯这段感情了。不过我觉得挺有意思的，因为分手后好像也涉及到一些政治因素。
[00:10:29.790] Relationships or dating and things like that because I've definitely been in my fair share of girls chats where it's like Oh my god, guess who's fucking ex? I just saw on hand and like screenshots are sent and stuff
[00:10:29.790] 谈恋爱、约会之类的，因为我肯定也参加过不少女生聊天，里面经常会冒出“我的天哪，猜猜谁是前任？”这种话，然后她们还会发截图什么的。
[00:10:40.790] So I feel like you know people talk yeah, and that's probably one of those tricky aspects. You have to navigate as well Wait, but actually on hinge now, there's a thing where you can put like looking for long-term short-term
[00:10:40.790] 所以我觉得你知道，人们都在谈论这件事，而这可能正是棘手之处之一。你也得学会如何应对。等等，不过现在Hinge上有个功能，你可以设置寻找长期或短期关系。
[00:10:57.350] It's nice overall, but I also feel like this is corny as fuck It is kind of because it's like if you put long-term relationship Yeah, maybe you are at that phase of your life but like how do you know like someone
[00:10:57.350] 总体来说还不错，但我觉得这也太老套了。某种程度上是这样的，就像如果你把“长期关系”写进去，嗯，也许你正处于人生的那个阶段，但你怎么知道对方是不是呢？
[00:11:08.590] Like that's immediately what you want, you know Cuz it varies from my person person that you meet right? You might want a long-term relationship with someone But you might want just like a who knows they they might just want short-term stuff
[00:11:08.590] 就像你一开始就想要那样，你知道吗？因为这因人而异，对吧？你可能想要一段长期的恋爱关系，但你也可能只想玩玩而已，谁知道呢，他们可能只想玩玩短期关系。
[00:11:21.550] They could put short term in that case. Yeah, but my point is it's it feels like very like pressure How do you even know you want a long-term relationship like to that extent, right? I think you do I can't imagine someone clearly putting
[00:11:21.550] 他们可以把这种情况归类为短期关系。是啊，但我的意思是，这感觉就像压力很大。你怎么能确定自己想要一段长期的关系，而且程度这么高呢？我觉得你是想要的。我无法想象有人会如此明确地表达这种想法。
[00:11:38.030] Maybe it's just maybe it's that she doesn't know How should I know? This is why I haven't answered that problem It's not on my profile You're gonna have to figure it out I'll keep it to myself
[00:11:38.030] 也许她根本不知道。我怎么会知道？这就是我为什么还没回答那个问题的原因。我的个人资料里没有答案。你得自己想办法。我会替你保密的。
[00:11:51.030] I do think sometimes it's like off-putting if like someone with a like long-term looking for a long-term Relationship pops up on your feed when you're looking for a short term then you're like, okay immediately
[00:11:51.030] 我觉得有时候挺让人反感的，比如当你只想找个短期伴侣的时候，突然看到一个寻找长期关系的人出现在你的动态里，你就会想，好吧，这感觉真的挺糟糕的。
[00:12:02.990] It's like a pro and a con because one maybe that person comes off kind of corny to you But it's also a pro because you know right away You're not gonna waste their time. Yeah, maybe they should make it a filter too
[00:12:02.990] 这有利有弊，一方面，你可能会觉得这个人有点土气；但另一方面，你也知道你不会浪费他们的时间。是啊，或许他们也应该把它加个筛选功能。
[00:12:14.990] Oh, I feel like actually I need to check I'm not sure I never filtered by that I don't judge Long term sure! I'm an open guy I'd be down
[00:12:14.990] 哦，我觉得我得确认一下，我不确定，我从来没按这个筛选过，我不评判，长远来看当然没问题！我这个人很开放，我很乐意。
[00:12:31.750] Think it was interesting what you mentioned earlier Jisoo about the like internal versus external like maybe internally you're already ready to Start going on the dating apps or whatever, but it's a little weird to post that externally or like make it known externally
[00:12:31.750] 我觉得你之前提到的关于内在和外在的话题很有意思，Jisoo，比如你可能内心已经准备好开始使用约会软件之类的，但对外公开或者让别人知道这件事会有点奇怪。
[00:12:47.550] But why is it weird? Is it because like your ex might see but like what if you guys like blocked each other? Like wouldn't blocking kind of protect you from these things But I mean realistically I think news still gets around
[00:12:47.550] 但为什么会觉得奇怪呢？是因为前任可能会看到吗？但如果你们互相拉黑了呢？拉黑不是能保护你们免受这些事情的影响吗？但说实话，我觉得消息还是会传开的。
[00:13:06.230] Like people will talk and I think it's natural like it's very natural to assume that after a breakup two people will find other People but I do think there's like a certain politeness to like navigating that Yeah, but I don't know what the exact like frame of references
[00:13:06.230] 人们会议论纷纷，我觉得很自然，分手后两个人都会找到新的伴侣，这很正常。但我确实觉得，处理这种情况需要一定的礼貌。是的，但我不知道具体的参照框架是什么。
[00:13:22.990] I mean for some people they might find it offensive even like six months after like, oh, that's too early for other people They might not give a shit after like a week So it's really person by person
[00:13:22.990] 我的意思是，有些人可能觉得六个月后发生的事很冒犯，而对另一些人来说，那可能太早了，他们可能一周后就完全不在乎了。所以这真的因人而异。
[00:13:31.470] But it's still like something that you should probably at least think about yeah But then does that lead to like people holding things back? Oh like not posting on social Yeah, does that kind of just like prevent someone who's like, I don't know already moving on I guess
[00:13:31.470] 但这仍然是你应该至少考虑一下的事情，对吧？但是，这是否会导致人们有所保留呢？比如不在社交媒体上发帖？是的，这是否会阻止那些已经……我不知道，已经开始前进的人？我想是的。
[00:13:48.350] Post on social or whatever about everything and anything that they want to post about I Think probably a little bit. Yeah. Yeah I mean, I think it's just it's kind of like a public perception thing mixed with like a consideration thing
[00:13:48.350] 他们会在社交媒体或其他平台上发布任何他们想发布的内容，我觉得可能有点儿吧。是的。我的意思是，我觉得这有点像公众认知和某种考量因素的混合体。
[00:14:02.590] It's like one like you probably don't want your ex to feel shitty about like seeing you like just like fucking around The other part is like you don't want your public image to be like, oh, he's already moving on
[00:14:02.590] 一方面，你可能不想让前任看到你到处乱搞而感到难过；另一方面，你也不想让公众觉得，哦，他已经开始新恋情了。
[00:14:16.670] You know, so it's like kind of like navigating that and like I think it is person-to-person But just doing whatever you feel like is respectful and yeah Comfortable with you and other parties involved and obviously that's gonna differ, too
[00:14:16.670] 你知道，这就像是处理这类事情一样，我觉得这取决于个人情况。但只要你觉得这样做既尊重他人，又让你和其他相关人员感到自在，当然，这也会因人而异。
[00:14:29.470] Do you think there's like a right amount of time to wait then? I think there is. Oh, okay I don't know what the exact number is But here's what I'm thinking like what you said about public perception actually makes me how to think about this
[00:14:29.470] 你觉得等待的时间是不是有个合适的期限？我觉得是有的。哦，好吧，我不知道确切的数字是多少。但你刚才说的公众认知确实让我重新思考这个问题。
[00:14:40.230] Because a lot of social media to me is like messaging You have some sort of message and that's why you post on your story and your Instagram or whatever so If I was a neutral party and I was seeing someone who just got out of a relationship
[00:14:40.230] 因为对我来说，很多社交媒体就像是在传递信息。你发帖是为了传达某种信息，所以才会发到你的故事、Instagram 或其他平台上。所以，如果我是一个中立的旁观者，而我认识的人刚刚结束一段感情，那会是什么感觉呢？
[00:14:55.150] Post say a new boo or like, you know, whatever. I would probably think that oh this person is already over their ex and Then it trickles into like a decision tree, right? It's like why are they over their ex so soon is this person's or like, you know
[00:14:55.150] 发帖说有了新恋情之类的，你知道的，诸如此类。我可能会想，哦，这个人已经放下前任了。然后这就有点像决策树了，对吧？就像，为什么他们这么快就放下前任了？这个人是不是……你知道的
[00:15:10.230] Does this mean that this was less meaningful or like, you know There's so many things that people can do and obviously all of it is speculation
[00:15:10.230] 这是否意味着这件事意义不大，或者说，你知道，人们可以做很多事情，而这一切显然都只是猜测。
[00:15:15.990] But the fact that you're even having people think these things in the first place is like a choice sort of so then maybe that's Why there is some sort of polite time frame again. I don't know what it would be probably at least three months, maybe
[00:15:15.990] 但事实上，人们一开始就会有这种想法，这本身就是一种选择，所以也许这就是为什么又要设定一个礼貌的期限。我不知道具体是多久，可能至少三个月吧。
[00:15:31.830] There's a lot of intent behind every decision a lot and you have to read into it You know and then interpret it like in your own way Interpreted how you think that the person posting it would have like wanted you to interpret it, you know
[00:15:31.830] 每个决定背后都蕴含着很多意图，你需要仔细揣摩，然后根据自己的理解去解读，也就是你认为发帖人希望你如何解读。
[00:15:43.870] So there's there's a fucking Game of Thrones modern day game of everyone others like Peter Bayliss Little finger. Yeah, I feel like there's another interpretation of like oh, is this a rebound? Yeah. Oh true
[00:15:43.870] 所以现在居然有个现代版的《权力的游戏》，除了彼得·贝利斯饰演的小指头之外，其他人都成了游戏角色。是啊，我觉得还有另一种解读，比如，哦，这是不是在疗伤？是啊。哦，确实如此。
[00:15:59.350] I think 100% of the time no. Yeah, I guess probably your mind can definitely default Yeah, yeah, that's true yeah, they're getting it with someone like immediately immediately if not like within a month
[00:15:59.350] 我觉得百分之百不会。是啊，我猜你的大脑肯定会有默认选项。是啊，没错，他们要么马上就跟某人搞好关系，要么一个月之内就搞好关系。
[00:16:12.750] I think that's a rebound. That's for sure. You know, it's tough to say no matter what timing there is I think you owe it to yourself after a breakup to Give yourself time to heal
[00:16:12.750] 我觉得那是反弹。这一点毋庸置疑。你知道，无论时间如何，都很难说。我觉得分手后你应该给自己时间疗伤。
[00:16:24.030] Yeah, like, you know, you're the best judge of like the right way to do that It's like sure like other people are gonna interpret it, you know the way they want but yeah
[00:16:24.030] 是啊，你知道，你最清楚怎么做才是正确的。当然，其他人会按照他们的想法去解读，但是……
[00:16:32.390] I think it's just like person to person and then also like people are gonna have different ways of feeling So as long as you're able to do it and that like navigate that situation in a way that feels like true to yourself
[00:16:32.390] 我觉得这就像人与人之间的差异，而且每个人感受的方式也都不一样。所以，只要你能做到，并且能以一种符合自己内心的方式来处理这种情况，那就没问题。
[00:16:42.790] I think that's like good. It's like how long does it take for a heart to heal? I mean, I'll be honest. I was not above like some petty social media shit back in the day
[00:16:42.790] 我觉得这样挺好。就像，一颗心需要多久才能愈合一样？说实话，以前我也喜欢在社交媒体上搞些鸡毛蒜皮的小事。
[00:16:56.890] Like I definitely don't like high school for you. Yeah, but it's like, you know, I think those urges exist That's why we try to like be mature and like oh just you know, whatever But I feel like the urges are like deep down there Like our human instinct
[00:16:56.890] 我真的不喜欢你上高中。是啊，但你知道，我觉得那些冲动是存在的。所以我们才努力表现得成熟，好像什么都无所谓似的。但我感觉那些冲动就像深藏在我们内心深处的本能。
[00:17:11.590] Oh for sure, there's been so many Sorry about that I think it's just natural to want to be like oh after the breakup I look so much better now or like I'm with this guy who's so nice or whatever
[00:17:11.590] 哦，当然，这样的道歉太多了。我觉得分手后想让自己看起来更好，或者觉得我跟一个特别好的男人在一起，都是很正常的。
[00:17:23.310] Like I've definitely done that shit in the past and I feel like it feels kind of good It feels hella good Yeah, it definitely feels good and it's like fun There's a way not to be petty about it too
[00:17:23.310] 我以前肯定干过这种事，感觉还挺爽的，爽爆了。对，感觉确实不错，挺有意思的。而且也没办法为此斤斤计较。
[00:17:33.110] Like I feel like when I post on Instagram now, I'm just like trying to Well, I didn't post that much during my relationship I feel like I didn't post that much before it either But I've been posting, it's a good like self-confidence boost
[00:17:33.110] 感觉我现在在Instagram上发帖的时候，就像是在努力……嗯，恋爱期间我发帖不多，感觉恋爱前也不多。但我现在开始发帖了，这确实能提升我的自信心。
[00:17:41.110] Trying to like not keep it like petty or related to my relationship Just like whatever brings you joy Yeah, like yeah That's true, but you're right Like the urge to essentially be like the winner I guess Right, right So speaking of winners Great transition
[00:17:41.110] 尽量不让它显得琐碎，也不让它和我的感情有关，就当是能让你快乐的事。对，对，没错，你说得对，就像那种想要成为赢家的冲动。对，对。说到赢家，过渡得真好。
[00:18:01.110] Do you think there's a winner and a loser in breakups? 100% 100% There's always going to be a natural level of competition But then like what defines a win in like a breakup? That is also very subjective I'd say I think on a superficial level
[00:18:01.110] 你觉得分手会有赢家和输家吗？100% 100% 总会存在某种程度的竞争。但是，分手这种事，到底什么才算是赢家呢？我觉得这很主观，从表面上看是这样。
[00:18:19.110] It's like whoever ends up with the hotter Oh wow Very superficial level That's why some people Yeah, it's like there's always a reacher and a settler Yeah, yeah, yeah So there's two factors to this There's the timing element, right Like if someone moves on quicker
[00:18:19.110] 就像谁最后和更漂亮的人在一起，哇哦，太肤浅了。这就是为什么有些人……是啊，就像总会有一个追求者和一个安于现状者。是啊，是啊，是啊。所以这其中有两个因素：时机，对吧？比如，如果有人进展得更快……
[00:18:37.110] They won kind of, right There's also like the superficial factor Which is like if you ended up with someone hotter than your ex Then that's another thing Damn But these are very surface level type win-lose That's what people see on social media And they're like
[00:18:37.110] 他们算是赢了，对吧？还有表面因素，比如如果你最后和比前任更火辣的人在一起了，那又是另一回事了。哎，但这些都是非常肤浅的输赢，这就是人们在社交媒体上看到的，然后他们就……
[00:18:53.110] Oh, like Eddie won the relationship Won the breakup I'm still working on it I see he's trying to be honest Can you give me a high five? Yeah, yeah, yeah Still working on it I think you're right though Maybe one really easy example to see this in
[00:18:53.110] 哦，就像埃迪赢得了这段感情，赢得了分手，我还在努力。我看得出来他想坦诚相待。能跟我击个掌吗？好，好，好。我还在努力。不过我觉得你说得对。也许有个很简单的例子可以说明这一点。
[00:19:11.110] Is like Hollywood Or like famous people There's often times comments like Oh, this person won the breakup Because check out who their next partner was I guess I just disagree with the concept of The hotter person Maybe that's more of a male perspective
[00:19:11.110] 就像好莱坞或者名人一样，经常会有人评论说：“哦，这个人分手赢了，因为看看他的下一任是谁。” 我觉得“长得好看的人赢”这种说法不太认同。也许这更多是男性的视角吧。
[00:19:29.110] But to me, I feel like the happier person Like wins the breakup I'm not saying that's like the end all be all Those are just dimensions Not the superficial guys I'd probably be a lot happier with a hotter person I think just like as humans
[00:19:29.110] 但我觉得，分手后更快乐的人更容易赢。我不是说这就是最终结果，这只是几个维度而已。我不在乎那些肤浅的人。我觉得如果对方更漂亮，我可能也会更快乐，毕竟我们都是人。
[00:19:45.110] That's like the first thing that your mind would jump to But there's so many other factors Maybe we're just cavemen Pretty lady Good word, win breakup No, I think that's definitely viable though It's like the easiest and most visual Conclusion I guess, right? But my counterpoint is like
[00:19:45.110] 那可能是你脑海里第一个蹦出来的想法，但还有很多其他因素。也许我们只是原始人。漂亮女士，说得好，分手赢了。不，我觉得这绝对可行。这大概是最简单、最直观的结论吧？但我的反驳是……
[00:20:07.110] I feel like you can end up with a hot person Right after the breakup But then if that relationship ends And you're on to the next And it keeps looping over Where you're in these short relationships with hot people
[00:20:07.110] 我觉得分手后你可能会很快遇到一个很帅的人，但如果这段感情也结束了，你又开始了下一段，然后这种循环就一直持续下去，你总是和帅哥美女陷入短暂的恋情。
[00:20:19.110] I would not be like that person won the breakup That would be like they won the battle but they lost It's a long game There's a lot of factors that come into play Going back to Crystal and Celebrities Pete Davidson's a fucking winner
[00:20:19.110] 我不会认为那个人赢得了分手，那样就好比他们赢得了战斗，但最终却输了。这是一场持久战，有很多因素需要考虑。再说回Crystal和名人，Pete Davidson真是个赢家。
[00:20:31.110] He went from hot person to hot person To hot person And he just keeps winning That guy is like a perpetrator He is not doing women well I'd say he's pretty fucking happy I think the end goal is just to be happy Ultimately yes
[00:20:31.110] 他从一个万人迷变成另一个万人迷，再变成另一个万人迷，而且一直赢个不停。这家伙简直就是个施暴者，他对女人并不友好。我觉得他应该挺开心的。我觉得他的最终目标就是让自己开心。没错。
[00:20:51.110] It's sort of like Jisoo The external, internal If you post a hotter person On your story Then you're winning externally Internally also it's the happiness thing If you're just happier I do think that the whole idea of a winner Or loser is a very superficial concept
[00:20:51.110] 这有点像Jisoo说的，外在和内在。如果你在动态里发一个更帅的人的照片，那么从外在看你赢了。从内在看，幸福感也很重要。如果你更快乐了，我觉得赢家或输家这种概念其实很肤浅。
[00:21:09.110] So I think that's why the external part For me at least gets associated more with that And then the internal part You can't quantitatively measure that as well You can't for the other part either I think there's like Clarification has to be made There can be two winners
[00:21:09.110] 所以我觉得这就是为什么外部因素对我来说更容易与此联系起来。至于内部因素，你无法对其进行量化衡量，其他因素也无法衡量。我觉得需要澄清一下，可以有两个赢家。
[00:21:25.110] There can be two losers That's a really good point I think in the long run The ideal is that you both become winners You keep winning Both of you Stay winning y'all It's a mentality thing I think it's definitely easy To maybe show Some sort of like
[00:21:25.110] 可以有两个输家。我觉得这一点很重要。从长远来看，理想的情况是你们俩都成为赢家。你们俩都不断赢，一直赢下去。这是一种心态问题。我觉得这很容易做到，也许可以表现出某种类似……
[00:21:51.110] I won in this area That person won in that area In the very beginning or earlier on Ultimately long term it's like Clearly everyone's over it And everyone became their own winners Hopefully Or you stay a loser forever That's the thing too
[00:21:51.110] 我在这方面赢了，那个人在那个方面赢了。一开始或者更早的时候，最终从长远来看，很明显，每个人都释怀了，每个人都成为了自己的赢家。但愿如此，否则你永远都是个输家。这就是关键所在。
[00:22:11.110] It's like two years after a relationship You don't really care if you won or lost It's only the first couple months It's only on a superficial level Just in small superficial aspects I feel like in the long term If you're truly gonna stay a loser
[00:22:11.110] 就像一段感情结束后两年，你不再在意输赢，那只是最初几个月的事，只是表面上的，只是些无关紧要的小事。我觉得从长远来看，如果你注定要一直当个失败者，那就太可惜了。
[00:22:27.110] It would be like I let her go It would be like if you never had personal growth You didn't learn from the break up That is a good point If you just stayed yourself If you just stayed your old self And didn't take that opportunity to grow
[00:22:27.110] 那就像我放她走了，就像你从未有过个人成长，没有从分手中吸取教训。说得对，如果你只是保持原样，如果你只是维持过去的自己，而没有抓住成长的机会。
[00:22:45.110] I think that's the biggest thing Learning from past mistakes Learning from past mistakes And being a better partner For your future relationships I think that's the ultimate way To say That's not even comparing at that point You're just doing it for yourself
[00:22:45.110] 我认为最重要的是从过去的错误中吸取教训，让自己在未来的感情关系中成为更好的伴侣。我认为这才是最终的答案。到了那个地步，根本无需比较，你只是在为自己而活。
[00:23:05.110] You're always winning if it's a stepping stone While you're leveling up every time Which is nice But yeah, you're a loser if you're just staying at the bottom You're just dog piling on the losers It's kind of funny to just say loser
[00:23:05.110] 如果每次都只是垫脚石，不断升级，那你永远都是赢家，这当然很好。但如果你一直停留在底层，那你就是个失败者，只会和其他失败者一起欺负。说“失败者”这个词本身就有点滑稽。
[00:23:21.110] That word doesn't get thrown out of there I think the real loser of a break up though Going back to what really divides The winner and the loser Is the person who takes longer to get over it Which is why I never thought about it
[00:23:21.110] 我觉得那个词不会被轻易抛出。不过，分手后真正的输家，说到底，真正造成分手的是需要更长时间才能走出来的那一个。这就是为什么我从来没想过这个问题。
[00:23:37.110] In the hotter person's eyes I was just like, oh this person is over it faster Maybe they're happier with friends And this person is sad for life Okay, no that makes sense That's a good way to judge it too It's more conceptual than a race
[00:23:37.110] 在长相更美的人眼里，我当时就想，哦，这个人走出来得更快，也许他们和朋友在一起更快乐，而这个人可能一辈子都郁郁寡欢。好吧，这么说也合理，这也是个不错的判断方式。这更多的是一种概念上的比较，而不是一场比赛。
[00:23:57.110] So I guess continuing on the topic of Who is a winner and who is a loser I feel like one of the things that tends to happen Post break ups Is that people are more emotional Maybe you're more open and willing to do new things
[00:23:57.110] 所以，如果继续讨论谁是赢家谁是输家这个话题，我觉得分手后往往会发生的一件事是，人们会变得更加情绪化，也许你会更加开放，更愿意尝试新鲜事物。
[00:24:09.110] And I feel like at least In my experience That has led me to do some mildly questionable things That I regret after a break up So have you guys ever had experiences like that Where post break up you do something You're like fuck it
[00:24:09.110] 我觉得至少就我的经验而言，分手后我做了一些有点儿不太妥当的事，事后我很后悔。所以你们有没有过类似的经历，分手后做了些什么，然后心想“管他呢”。
[00:24:23.110] And then later you're like, okay I was on some Break up energy shit There probably are things But I maybe repressed them Maybe I don't regret them I don't think I've truly regretted anything Maybe some questionable DMs But okay, that's probably it Quite questionable DMs
[00:24:23.110] 然后后来你会想，好吧，我当时可能正处于分手后的低落情绪中。也许有些事，但我可能压抑住了。也许我不后悔。我觉得我并没有真正后悔过什么。也许有一些不太靠谱的私信。好吧，大概就这些了。一些不太靠谱的私信。
[00:24:45.110] You don't regret them though You're just putting up shots You gotta put up shots in the gym sometimes What do you mean questionable DM Like the content was questionable or the fact that you DMed These people is questionable? Both Okay so the second is
[00:24:45.110] 你并不后悔，你只是在练习投篮而已。有时候在健身房里，你得练习投篮。你说的“可疑的私信”是什么意思？是指私信内容有问题，还是你给这些人发私信这件事本身有问题？两者都有问题。好的，所以第二个问题是……
[00:25:01.110] It's all like people on dating apps mostly So definitely that The content, yeah, looking back Holy shit, sometimes I was I look back sometimes and I was like damn These girls match with me after I was So down bad I've done some crazy ass shit
[00:25:01.110] 感觉就像大多数人都在用约会软件一样。所以肯定是这样。内容嘛，回想起来，我的天哪，有时候我回头看，会想：妈的，这些女孩居然在我情绪低落到极点的时候跟我配对，我做了好多疯狂的事。
[00:25:17.110] And I think now I've settled into A very comfortable, if it happens, it happens If it doesn't, it doesn't, you know So I feel like it's more confidence in myself I won't send as like fucking down bad shit Thankfully But yeah, nothing too serious I would say
[00:25:17.110] 我觉得我现在很放松，顺其自然，该发生就发生，不发生就不发生，你知道的。所以我觉得自己更有自信了，不会再像以前那样搞砸了，谢天谢地。不过，没什么太严重的事情发生。
[00:25:31.110] I feel like I've been mostly intentional With other stuff I feel it's the same for me I don't think I regret anything You know, like post breakup Because there's honestly like Sort of like a learning period You get a pass Right? After Alexa, I hoed out A lot
[00:25:31.110] 我觉得我做事基本都是有意识的，其他事情也是如此。我不后悔任何事，你知道，就像分手之后那样。因为说实话，分手后会有一个学习期，你可以宽容一些，对吧？和Alexa分手后，我放纵了很多。
[00:25:53.110] No, I was a straight up ho for like Three months I was putting up insane numbers Jesus Christ Michael Jordan numbers 96 Bulls numbers Like dream team I don't regret it, you know Obviously I'm not in that point of my life anymore I feel like regret
[00:25:53.110] 不，我当时简直就是个花花公子，整整三个月，数据疯狂得惊人，我的天，迈克尔·乔丹的数据，96年公牛队的数据，梦之队的数据，我不后悔，你知道的。当然，我现在的生活已经不是那个阶段了，我感觉不到后悔。
[00:26:15.110] Is a wasted emotion A little philosophical Philosophical So I think it's Normal and very human to regret things But there's so many Things you can regret in life And I think it's natural to feel those things But like at the end of the day
[00:26:15.110] 浪费感情？有点哲学意味？哲学意味。所以我觉得后悔是正常且人之常情。人生中值得后悔的事情太多了，我觉得有这种感觉很自然。但归根结底……
[00:26:35.110] You do something that you look back on And you didn't think was true to yourself Or you didn't think There's reasons you regret it But I think you can also take something away from it And learn from that experience And not do it in the future
[00:26:35.110] 你做了一些事，事后回想起来，觉得并不合乎自己的心意，或者你当时根本没想过会这样。你会后悔，这其中肯定有原因。但我认为你也可以从中吸取教训，避免将来重蹈覆辙。
[00:26:49.110] Or be better about it I think in that sense, the regret doesn't last It's just kind of a short term emotion So I think I look At a lot of my decisions after like that Sure I regret it in the moment
[00:26:49.110] 或者说，我觉得应该做得更好。从这个意义上讲，后悔不会持续太久，它只是一种短暂的情绪。所以我觉得事后回想我的很多决定时，我都会这样想。当然，当时我也会后悔。
[00:27:01.110] But I do a little bit more about myself And hopefully I won't repeat those mistakes And then just move on I'd say the regret still stands Especially for relationships I know there's a couple of girls Honestly, I should have stayed with her
[00:27:01.110] 但我会更加反省自己，希望不会重蹈覆辙，然后继续前进。说实话，我仍然感到后悔，尤其是在感情方面。我知道我和几个女孩都交往过。老实说，我当时应该和她在一起的。
[00:27:17.110] So more like regrets about the relationship Or how it ended Yeah exactly The fact that we're actually really compatible Is just I was in a place in my life Where I could do something about it I'm talking about three specific ones They all have boyfriends
[00:27:17.110] 所以更像是对这段感情的遗憾，或者说是对它结束方式的遗憾。没错，我们其实很合拍，只是当时我的人生阶段允许我采取行动。我指的是三个特定的人，她们都有男朋友。
[00:27:37.110] Three is a lot From different phases of my life One right after high school One during college I think if you're in a position where you can't do anything about it Not gonna put up shots I'm saying like if there is an actionable step
[00:27:37.110] 三个确实很多，分别来自我人生的不同阶段。一个是高中毕业后，一个是大学期间。我觉得如果你身处无能为力的境地，那就没什么好说的了。我不是说要投篮，我是说，如果有切实可行的步骤的话。
[00:27:55.110] That you can take on yourself I would have taken it Then there's no reason to regret something That's a good outlook I don't know if I had too many regrets Also my breakup happened When we were a little more experienced Mature, older It was just less likely maybe
[00:27:55.110] 如果你能自己承担，我也会承担。那样的话，就没有理由后悔了。这真是个好心态。我不知道自己有没有太多遗憾。而且，我们分手的时候，我们都更有经验、更成熟、更年长一些。也许这种情况发生的概率比较小吧。
[00:28:17.110] To go out and do stupid decisions It was more like Hey let's just chill at home Have fun time with friends There was less room Or potential for Stupid decisions at that time So I don't have any Big regrets that come to mind
[00:28:17.110] 那时候，与其出去做蠢事，不如就待在家里和朋友们放松玩乐。那时候做蠢事的可能性很小，所以我也没有什么特别后悔的事。
[00:28:35.110] I feel like I have a lot We saved the best for last But they're really fucking old I don't even know if it's still relevant I feel like it's more associated with age Than maybe it was about the actual breakup
[00:28:35.110] 我觉得我有很多东西，我们把最好的留到了最后，但它们真的太老了，我甚至不知道它们是否还有意义。我觉得它更多地与年龄有关，而不是与分手本身有关。
[00:28:49.110] I guess one of the things that I remember About the periods of time Where I had breakups I just had such low self-esteem And I feel like that makes you do things That are maybe not Something that will serve your interests In the long run
[00:28:49.110] 我想，我记得分手那段时间，我的自尊心特别低。我觉得这种低自尊会让人做出一些长远来看可能不利于自己的事情。
[00:29:05.110] Things that you don't really want to do So I feel like some of my post-breakup phases I was very attention seeking From men And then I kind of regret that period I feel like I could have been Maybe trying to build more on myself Or work on myself
[00:29:05.110] 有些事你其实并不想做。我觉得分手后的那段时间，我特别渴望得到男人的关注。后来我有点后悔那段时间，感觉我当时应该多花些时间提升自己，或者好好反省自己。
[00:29:21.110] And turn more internal But instead I was like, oh it's super easy To get attention from guys So I'll just turn outwards and do that Which is not very fulfilling in the long run It all ended up okay But one of the things that I definitely regret
[00:29:21.110] 我本想更内省一些，但我却觉得，哦，吸引男生的注意力太容易了，所以我干脆转向外向，这么做。但从长远来看，这并不能带来真正的满足感。最终一切都还算顺利，但有一件事我绝对后悔。
[00:29:35.110] Was after one breakup I reached out to someone I used to talk to in the past And then we met up It was really meh So then I was like, why did I even do that? There was no purpose Really all I wanted was
[00:29:35.110] 分手后，我联系了以前认识的一个朋友，然后我们见了面。感觉很一般，我就想，我为什么要这么做？毫无意义。其实我想要的只是……
[00:29:51.110] Someone there for that one time But it's so meaningless And it's like rehashing old shit It's just like, why? This is really old tea When you have low self-esteem And you want easy gratification And it's easy to find that Then you just lean into that
[00:29:51.110] 有人只出现过一次，但这毫无意义，就像在炒冷饭，毫无新意。这简直是老掉牙的话题。当你缺乏自信，渴望轻易获得满足，而这种满足又很容易找到时，你就会沉溺其中。
[00:30:09.110] And I feel like forget other things that are important But they were learning moments for you, right? Yeah, definitely And I think you also actually learn from previous breakups You know, this is the easy path But if I take this, I'll feel like shit in two months
[00:30:09.110] 我觉得你会忘记其他重要的事情，但对你来说，那也是学习的时刻，对吧？是的，当然。而且我觉得你也会从之前的感情破裂中学到东西。你知道，这条路虽然简单，但如果我走这条路，两个月后我会感觉糟透了。
[00:30:21.110] Versus this is the hard way And I'll focus on myself And I'll be fine in four months So I'm sure you build upon that knowledge Oh, but there is one thing That I feel like It wasn't necessarily regret But it was something that I grappled with
[00:30:21.110] 相比之下，这条路更难走，我会专注于自身，四个月后我就会好起来。所以我相信你会从中汲取经验。哦，但有一件事，我觉得那未必是后悔，而是我一直在努力克服的。
[00:30:37.110] Right after a breakup I felt kind of emotionally numb for a while I was pretty disinterested In meeting new people And I was pretty disinterested In forming new connections Because it was like, damn, that's a lot of work And maybe it was the anticipation Of in the future
[00:30:37.110] 分手后，我有一段时间感觉情绪麻木，对认识新朋友没什么兴趣，也不想建立新的关系，因为我觉得，哎，那太费劲了。也许是因为对未来的担忧吧。
[00:30:55.110] If I were to have another boyfriend I would have to go through all this work To get to know them And build this thing all up again So I definitely had a period of time Where I was just emotionally numb I really couldn't care less for random people
[00:30:55.110] 如果我再交个男朋友，就得重新经历一遍了解对方、重建感情的过程。所以，我确实有一段时间情感麻木，对陌生人完全提不起兴趣。
[00:31:09.110] Was that romantically too? Or also just friend-wise? Like socially, meeting new people I think it was mostly romantically And then in terms of Meeting new people It like wavered Sometimes I was like, I don't have the energy to do this today But then sometimes I was like, okay
[00:31:09.110] 那也是恋爱关系吗？还是也包括朋友关系？比如社交方面，认识新朋友，我觉得主要是恋爱关系。至于认识新朋友这件事，感觉有点摇摆不定。有时候我会想，我今天没精力做这件事。但有时候我又会想，好吧。
[00:31:27.110] Maybe I'll try to meet some friends Yeah, I can definitely empathize with that Because I feel like the hurt That you feel either during the breakup Or sometimes for a lot of women Especially, I feel like it's before You're like deliberating about it for so long
[00:31:27.110] 也许我会试着见见朋友。是的，我完全能理解你的感受，因为我能体会那种痛苦，无论是在分手时，还是对很多女性来说，尤其是在分手之前，那种感觉真的很难受。你会为此犹豫很久。
[00:31:43.110] You're just emotionally spent And then you no longer have any energy To put towards that So I feel like it's natural to just be like, okay, whatever I'm checked out for the time being Yeah, I mean there's a term for that, right? Like emotionally unavailable
[00:31:43.110] 你只是情绪耗尽了，然后就再也没有精力投入到那件事上了。所以我觉得很自然地就会想，好吧，算了，我暂时不想管了。嗯，我的意思是，这种情况有个专门的词来形容，对吧？比如“情感上无法投入”。
[00:31:57.110] Oh shit, you're right It's a big thing Yeah, it was like when I was in my ho phase There was honestly a good amount of girls That I could have actually started something Long-term with them But then the fact that I was emotionally unavailable It never happened
[00:31:57.110] 哦，糟了，你说得对，这可是件大事。是啊，就像我以前玩花花公子那会儿，说实话，我认识不少女孩，本来可以和她们发展一段长期的关系。但因为我当时情感上无法投入，所以最终都没能成真。
[00:32:15.110] And they honestly get the gist After like a month or two months Like, okay, this guy This guy's a bad boy He's not good for me This guy isn't getting more and more emotionally Aware of everything else They sniff it out after a month
[00:32:15.110] 过了一两个月，他们就真的明白了。他们会想，好吧，这个人，这个人是个坏男孩，他不适合我，这个人越来越不理智，越来越不敏感。他们一个月后就能察觉到。
[00:32:35.110] I think for me, I wasn't Emotionally numb I think I got jaded I went on a lot of first dates I was like, damn, this fucking shit sucks It's a lot of the same conversations You kind of sense out whether or not
[00:32:35.110] 我觉得对我来说，我不是情感麻木，而是变得愤世嫉俗。我经历了很多次初次约会，然后我就想，妈的，这真他妈糟糕。总是重复同样的对话。你会慢慢感觉到是否……
[00:32:51.110] You would hit it off with them after a couple conversations And then after you do that cycle Of meeting someone, matching with someone Meeting up with them Talking first date or two It gets very repetitive And you lose a little bit of hope I guess
[00:32:51.110] 几次聊天后，你们可能就聊得很投机。然后，你又重复着这个循环：认识新朋友、配对成功、见面聊天、第一次或两次约会。这个过程非常重复，我想你会慢慢失去一些希望。
[00:33:09.110] So you're like, fuck, I don't want to go through that again But I feel like I'm still hopeful After that experience There was a stretch of a month Where I went on 7 or 8 dates It was just a lot
[00:33:09.110] 所以你会想，妈的，我不想再经历一次了。但那次经历之后，我感觉自己仍然抱有希望。有那么一个月，我约会了七八次。真的太多了。
[00:33:27.110] I think I had the energy for it at the time But it really drained me after After that, I was like, damn I probably won't take out everybody Because I know I'm able to But I gotta be a little more selective A little more intentional
[00:33:27.110] 我觉得当时我有精力，但之后真的让我精疲力竭。在那之后，我就想，糟了，我可能不会把所有人都干掉，因为我知道我有这个能力，但我必须更有选择性，更有计划性。
[00:33:41.110] So it's definitely slowed down a lot since then I don't think I've been on too many dates since then For better or for worse Maybe I should be putting myself a little more out there But I don't want to waste my time Or someone else's time
[00:33:41.110] 所以从那以后，我的约会频率确实下降了很多。我想我之后也没怎么约会过。不管好坏，也许我应该更积极主动一些，但我不想浪费自己的时间，也不想浪费别人的时间。
[00:33:55.110] If over text, I can already sense that Things aren't going to work out Going with your gut feeling Yeah, I think so You get a sense for it too Some of these people on dating apps are like fucking robots So boring NPCs They're literally NPCs
[00:33:55.110] 如果只是文字交流，我就能感觉到事情不会有结果。相信你的直觉吧？嗯，我也这么觉得。你也有这种感觉。有些约会软件上的人简直就像机器人一样，无聊透顶，跟NPC没什么两样。他们真的就是NPC。
[00:34:13.110] Yeah, I feel like dating apps is pretty tough Because it's just like The only way kind of right now So it's so much stuff you have to Filter through And there's kind of I feel like girls Are really The worst on apps
[00:34:13.110] 是啊，我觉得约会软件挺难用的，因为现在好像是唯一的办法了。所以要筛选的东西太多了，而且我觉得女生在软件上真的挺糟糕的。
[00:34:31.110] I know that there's a ton of people Who complain about Bumble Because the girl is supposed to start the conversation But they just say like, hi Yeah, that's just the worst There's so much low effort out there I will say Honestly, it's reasonable
[00:34:31.110] 我知道很多人抱怨 Bumble，因为按理说应该是女生主动发起对话，但他们往往只是简单地说声“嗨”。是啊，这简直太糟糕了。现在这种敷衍了事的人太多了。说实话，这很合理。
[00:34:47.110] Because the guy experience is so drastically different I wrote a fucking analogy Let me pull it up on my phone The guy experience is so So different from the girl experience I wrote this If a girl finding love on Hinge can be compared
[00:34:47.110] 因为男生的经历和女生的经历截然不同，所以我写了个比喻。让我用手机调出来。男生的经历和女生的经历真的太不一样了。我写这个比喻是这样的：如果一个女生在Hinge上找到爱情可以和男生的经历相比较的话。
[00:35:01.110] To sifting through countless pebbles and dirt In a river in hopes for gold A guy finding love on Hinge Is like the river eroding the earth over millennia To send that gold downstream In hopes its sparkle will allow it to be Uncovered by the one
[00:35:01.110] 就像在河里淘金，从无数的鹅卵石和泥土中寻找黄金，一个男人在Hinge上找到爱情，就像河流历经千年侵蚀大地，将黄金顺流而下，希望它的光芒能被那个对的人发现。
[00:35:15.110] It's a very different experience Because girls have hella likes coming in all the time So they have to sift through that Guys have to really work on themselves To make themselves stand out You have to be in a sea of fucking likes
[00:35:15.110] 这完全是两种不同的体验，因为女生每天都会收到海量的点赞，所以她们必须从中筛选。男生则必须真正努力让自己脱颖而出，因为你必须身处一片点赞的海洋中。
[00:35:27.110] How are you going to stick out as a profile That they just see for an instant Bro, these girls have like hundreds of fucking likes It's actually crazy The experience is very very different Because as a guy you're constantly putting yourself out there
[00:35:27.110] 兄弟，你的个人资料要怎么才能脱颖而出？她们可能只是匆匆一瞥，这些女生可是有几百个赞呢，简直太疯狂了。这体验真的非常非常不一样，因为作为男生，你得不断地把自己展示出来。
[00:35:39.110] Every time I'm like, I want this first date with you That's crazy How did I stand out? I didn't say anything Especially interesting or anything It's like wow It's also very emotionally draining You constantly have to put yourself out there But then for girls it's also like
[00:35:39.110] 每次我都想，我想要和你第一次约会，这太疯狂了。我怎么才能脱颖而出呢？我什么都没说，也没说什么特别有趣的话。真是不可思议。而且这也很耗费精力，你必须不断地展现自己。但对女生来说，情况也差不多。
[00:35:57.110] You see so many mid profiles It's also probably really draining for them too There's two sides of it I feel like people get really jaded Really tired That's why you probably see a lot of low effort I feel like I try to put in
[00:35:57.110] 你会看到很多中等水平的博主，这可能对他们来说也很累。事情有两面性，我觉得人们会变得很厌倦，很疲惫，所以你会看到很多敷衍了事的作品。我觉得我努力想做到最好。
[00:36:11.110] Effort where I see it now If it's reciprocated That's a very clear signal If it's not, you can't make someone else Put more effort in Just move on I still think girls can do better I agree Put in a little more energy I actually feel like our generation
[00:36:11.110] 就我目前所见，如果付出得到回报，那就是一个非常明确的信号；如果没有，你无法强迫别人付出更多努力，那就继续前进吧。我仍然认为女孩们可以做得更好，我同意，应该投入更多精力。我感觉我们这一代人确实如此。
[00:36:31.110] Specifically us plus or minus a couple years Are going to really shape what online dating looks like For the future Because we're the first real users of the apps I know the websites and stuff existed But the internet culture has evolved so much
[00:36:31.110] 具体来说，我们这一代人，前后几年，将真正塑造未来在线约会的格局，因为我们是这些应用的第一批真正用户。我知道网站之类的东西早就存在了，但互联网文化已经发生了翻天覆地的变化。
[00:36:45.110] So you guys should send feedback And try to actually shape the app world I have so much feedback If I ever get fired from my job I'm going to make a dating app I'll make it so much better than Hinge and Bumble Because it's such a bad experience
[00:36:45.110] 所以大家应该多多反馈，努力真正地去改变这个应用世界。我有很多意见想说。如果我哪天被炒鱿鱼了，我就自己做一个约会应用，而且我会把它做得比Hinge和Bumble好得多，因为它们的体验实在太糟糕了。
[00:37:01.110] I think it needs to be Both sides get rewarded for putting in effort Somehow there needs to be a way to do that Because it's tough I think Sure girls have to sift through stuff But that doesn't make up for Girls just expecting guys To carry the conversation
[00:37:01.110] 我认为双方都应该因为付出努力而获得回报。必须找到一种方法来实现这一点，因为这确实很困难。当然，女生需要筛选信息，但这并不能弥补女生总是期望男生主导谈话的不足。
[00:37:23.110] You should pull your weight too Because that's also how a relationship works The worst part is It's low effort because people know they have Hella options out there They could be like Let me match with this guy But I have 500 other likes That I can go through
[00:37:23.110] 你也应该尽一份力，因为一段感情就是这样维系的。最糟糕的是，人们都懒得付出努力，因为他们知道自己有很多选择。他们可能会想：让我先和这个人配对吧，但我还有500个其他喜欢的人可以慢慢挑选。
[00:37:41.110] And I don't have to put that much effort in Because I know I have all this interest in me So I'm not going to be like Yeah she's not replying so I'll just move on It's a constant cycle I feel like that's very damaging Mentally and emotionally
[00:37:41.110] 我不需要投入那么多精力，因为我知道大家都在关注我。所以我不会因为“她不回复我就放弃”就这么算了。我觉得这就像一个恶性循环，对我的精神和情感都非常有害。
[00:37:55.110] I feel like as a guy you gotta actually Shape different strats too For real, for me You sound like Diabolical Not on some Diabolical shit But it's just like For my strat When a girl replies I'd have to reply immediately My strat was I'd reply immediately
[00:37:55.110] 我觉得作为男生，你也得制定不同的策略。真的，对我来说，你听起来像个恶魔。不是说你做了什么恶魔般的事，而是就像我的策略一样。当女生回复我的时候，我必须立刻回复。我的策略就是立刻回复。
[00:38:15.110] And obviously she would reply I would try to get at least one conversation That's actually good Because it's so fucking hard To have a conversation If you miss a few hours they couldn't not check the app for a few days And then there's a sea of other likes
[00:38:15.110] 她肯定会回复，我会尽量至少跟她聊一次天。这其实挺好的，因为现在聊天真的太难了。如果你错过几个小时，他们不可能几天都不查看应用。然后就会看到一大堆其他的点赞。
[00:38:29.110] And they'll just miss you You're buried in that sea You gotta really hit the sweet spot But also you can't seem too fucking desperate Because if you reply right away dude No I agree You probably have to You gotta throw away your desperation Insecurities there
[00:38:29.110] 他们会错过你，你被埋没在那片海洋里。你必须真正击中要害，但也不能显得太绝望。因为如果你立刻回复，兄弟，不，我同意，你可能必须这么做，你必须抛弃你的绝望和不安全感。
[00:38:47.110] Because you just have to Reply to her when she's on the app Or else she's probably never gonna reply again Fuck I should've replied faster Dude that sucks I feel like apps just Magnify the games that people play Especially But I feel like that's so Stupid
[00:38:47.110] 因为你必须在她打开应用的时候回复她，否则她可能永远不会再回复了。操，我应该更快回复的。真倒霉。我觉得这些应用只会放大人们玩弄感情的把戏，尤其是……但我觉得这太蠢了。
[00:39:07.110] I don't want to deal with I don't want to deal with it I lowkey have an idea that could be genius Or it could be troll as fuck So my mom was telling me About the dating culture back in the day In Korea
[00:39:07.110] 我不想处理这件事，我不想处理这件事。我其实有个想法，可能是个天才的想法，也可能是个彻头彻尾的恶搞。我妈跟我讲了以前韩国的约会文化。
[00:39:21.110] And what they used to do was set up 3-3 single dates Sort of so it's kind of like speed dating But in a controlled 6 people kind of environment And what that does is you're kind of talking live To each other And then you also are not just thinking
[00:39:21.110] 他们以前的做法是安排三到三次单独约会，有点像快速约会，但环境比较封闭，最多六个人。这样做的好处是，大家可以面对面地交流，而不仅仅是纸上谈兵。
[00:39:37.110] Oh is this person right for me But you probably are thinking Is this person the best out of these 3 people Which helps you narrow down the options a little bit It's a little bit less nebulous What if there's a love triangle situation There could be
[00:39:37.110] 哦，这个人适合我吗？但你可能在想，这三个人里，这个人是不是最好的？这能帮你缩小选择范围，让你更清楚地了解情况。如果出现三角恋怎么办？有可能。
[00:39:51.110] But the thing is And I feel like It maybe makes the women Compete a little bit too Oh true That is pretty good Both sides putting their best selves There needs to be a little more effort on all ends I thought of another idea
[00:39:51.110] 但问题是，我觉得这可能会让女性之间的竞争也加剧。哦，确实如此，这很好，双方都展现出了最好的一面。各方都需要再努力一些。我又想到一个主意。
[00:40:09.110] What if in the app you have A minute to respond Or else you just lose a person Like on both ends You're like I'm going to start a conversation right now And then the timer counts down Once you send it
[00:40:09.110] 如果应用里只有一分钟回复时间，否则就会失去对方，那会怎么样？就像双方都想着“我要马上开始聊天了”，然后发送消息后计时器就开始倒计时。
[00:40:23.110] Don't put all these ideas on the fucking phone I'm trying to Or it's like Omegle You can only talk to one person I've been thinking about that a lot It's a good way of looking at it Then you really have to be selective Be intentional
[00:40:23.110] 别把所有这些想法都塞到手机里，我正在努力。不然就像 Omegle 一样，你只能跟一个人聊天。我一直在思考这个问题，这确实是个不错的视角。然后你就真的需要有所选择，要有意识地去做。
[00:40:39.110] Otherwise just move on to the next one I think the intentionality Is the most important part Some people are on there to Give validation A sea of likes They're just being pen pals I know where that term is from But yeah People have different intents
[00:40:39.110] 否则就直接跳到下一个吧。我觉得意图才是最重要的。有些人上去只是为了寻求认同，博取点赞。他们只是在当笔友。我知道这个词的由来。但确实，每个人的目的都不一样。
[00:40:59.110] When it comes to these apps Sometimes those intents don't match up If you're looking to seriously date It's just a matter of Sifting through all the options To find someone that has the same mentality Which can be really tiring I think you really have to limit the options
[00:40:59.110] 说到这些交友软件，有时候彼此的意图并不匹配。如果你想认真谈恋爱，就得在众多选择中筛选，才能找到和自己想法相同的人。这真的很累人。我觉得你真的应该缩小选择范围。
[00:41:15.110] Because there's just option fatigue It's hard to make a decision When there's so many In the Bay Area too There's so many guys You'll have a better time in New York All those dates happen in New York Try to do it I've gotten off of the dating apps
[00:41:15.110] 因为选择太多，让人眼花缭乱，很难做决定。湾区选择也很多，男生也很多。在纽约你会过得更开心，所有约会都在纽约。试试吧，我已经不用约会软件了。
[00:41:35.110] And now I'm just trying to do organic shit He's really happy bro Trying to be there in life He's on the dating apps, he's living life Off the dating apps Organic, meet friends of friends I'm also idealistic I kind of want to brush up on
[00:41:35.110] 现在我只想做些自然而然的事。他真的很开心，兄弟。努力融入生活。他用约会软件，享受生活。不用约会软件，自然而然地认识朋友的朋友。我也是个理想主义者，有点想温习一下。
[00:41:51.110] A girl passing by And then just start a conversation Romantic It's like a Hallmark movie Yeah you know like fingers fucking just Jimmy's got hopes It hasn't happened yet It's been like a year Things are looking a little bleak So it hasn't happened yet
[00:41:51.110] 一个女孩路过，然后就聊了起来，很浪漫，就像 Hallmark 电影一样。你知道，就像手指爱抚，吉米满怀希望，但还没发生。已经过去一年了，情况看起来有点糟糕，所以还没发生。
[00:42:11.110] It's not a good strat I have hope on the dating apps still I feel like one day I'll wake up And there'll be a little like There are success stories I got hope, I got mad hope It's dwindling a little bit
[00:42:11.110] 这并非什么好策略，但我仍然对约会软件抱有希望。我觉得总有一天我会醒来，发现一些成功的例子。我心怀希望，我充满希望，尽管这希望正在逐渐消退。
[00:42:25.110] I feel like sometimes taking a break too Helps rekindle the hope You're like I'm improved now I'm confident Not constantly But every once in a while Refreshing the profile, keeping it nice Making sure it fully represents you I feel like that's a little activity too
[00:42:25.110] 我觉得有时候休息一下也能重燃希望。你会说：“我现在进步了很多，也更有自信了。” 虽然不是一直如此，但偶尔刷新一下个人资料，让它保持美观，确保它能充分展现你的形象，我觉得这也算是一种小小的活动吧。
[00:42:43.110] Some people don't give a fuck on their profile It's like what's one thing you want to do this year Travel What would make you fall for me Oh if you have a dog Oh man yeah When I see that shit My blood pressure rises
[00:42:43.110] 有些人根本不在乎自己的个人资料，比如“今年最想做的一件事是什么？”“旅行”“什么会让你爱上我？”“哦，如果你养狗的话。”“哦，天哪，是啊！”每次看到这种东西，我的血压都飙升。
[00:42:59.110] Why are you on Hinge? To delete it Oh my god bro God damn What's your ideal hangout Some boba The worst is What makes you different Or some shit It's like I actually know where I want to eat That's a fucking Bare minimum response man
[00:42:59.110] 你为什么用Hinge？为了删掉它？我的天啊兄弟，我的天啊！你理想的聚会是什么样的？喝杯珍珠奶茶？最糟糕的问题是“你有什么特别之处？”或者其他什么乱七八糟的问题。就好像我真的知道自己想去哪儿吃饭似的。这他妈也太敷衍了吧。
[00:43:21.110] Girls have they know where to want to eat All these girls know where to want it Be honest though You're still fucking shooting your shot I'm still shooting my shot All I have to do is look cute and I'll shoot my shot The worst part it gets rewarded
[00:43:21.110] 女孩们都知道想去哪儿吃饭，所有这些女孩都知道想去哪儿。说实话，你还在瞎猜，我也还在猜。我只需要看起来可爱就能出手，最糟糕的是，它居然还得到了回报。
[00:43:35.110] All these guys reward this behavior Yeah you're rewarded I'm doing it as part of the problem So it's a tried true method Why as a girl Are you going to try It's a good word in the DMs It's a repeating cycle Self fulfilling prophecy Oh yeah
[00:43:35.110] 这些人都在奖励这种行为。没错，你得到了奖励。我这么做也是问题的一部分。所以这是一种屡试不爽的方法。为什么作为一个女孩，你会尝试？在私信里说这话很灵验。这是一个不断重复的循环，自我实现的预言。哦，是的。
[00:43:59.110] This has nothing to do with breakups I feel It does The whole app culture is a big part of Not necessarily just breakups too But the whole What you do after a breakup How people interact with each other How people meet each other Are from breakups Yeah
[00:43:59.110] 我觉得这跟分手无关，但其实有关系。整个应用程序文化都是很大一部分，不仅仅是分手，而是分手后人们的所作所为、人们之间的互动方式、人们如何相遇等等，都源于分手。
[00:44:23.110] Almost like a prerequisite I've seen some Couples looking for a third I feel like a good amount of them are Even freshly broken up people I've come across a fair share of those And it's also you kind of serve as their It's not fun
[00:44:23.110] 几乎就像是先决条件一样，我见过一些情侣想找第三者，我觉得其中相当一部分人都是这样。甚至包括刚分手的人，我也遇到过不少。而且，你某种程度上也扮演了他们的角色。这并不好玩。
[00:44:47.110] I was about to say that's therapeutic for that To all the listeners out there Please go on the apps when you're actually ready to date I'm not trying to be your therapist But he will be I've done it and I'm still I'm not proud of it but like
[00:44:47.110] 我正要说，这对那种人来说有疗愈作用。致所有听众：请在真正准备好约会的时候再使用约会软件。我不是想当你们的心理咨询师，但他会的。我做过，而且我仍然……我不为此感到骄傲，但是……
[00:45:03.110] Seriously take the time you need to heal Eddie will be there to reassure you I'll still be there to be a shoulder you can cry on Please I'm running out of energy for this And I think it's also totally okay
[00:45:03.110] 真的，你需要时间好好疗伤，埃迪会一直在你身边安慰你，我也会一直陪在你身边，让你依靠我的肩膀哭泣。拜托了，我真的没精力再说这些了。而且我觉得这样也完全没问题。
[00:45:19.110] To be like I think I'm ready to go on the apps Go on the apps and then be like You know what actually I don't think I'm ready And then just leave I think a lot of girls too This might be for different reasons
[00:45:19.110] 有时候，我会想“我觉得我已经准备好用交友软件了”，然后打开软件，接着又会想“其实我还没准备好”，然后就放弃了。我觉得很多女生也会这样。这可能是出于各种不同的原因。
[00:45:31.110] Download the app, they'll delete it later on Redownload it Maybe that's part of fatigue I think there's also a more diabolical If you remake your account You get put to the front That's true Holy shit Diabolical hinge mechanics There's some crazy algorithms I got some strats
[00:45:31.110] 下载应用，他们之后会删除它，再重新下载。也许这是疲劳的表现。我觉得还有更阴险的。如果你重新注册账号，你会被排在最前面。没错。我的天！这铰链机制太阴险了！这算法太疯狂了。我有一些策略。
[00:45:53.110] I remember when I moved to the bay When I moved back New location and everything I think they shot my profile up And I was like holy shit I don't know what to do It's like a boost Would you say it's like sifting in a river
[00:45:53.110] 我记得我搬到湾区的时候，搬回来之后一切都变了，我觉得他们把我的个人资料都提升了，我当时就想，我的天哪，我不知道该怎么办，就像突然被提拔了一样。你会说这就像在河里淘金吗？
[00:46:09.110] Like through pebbles and stuff Or eroding I'm not gonna lie the bay area Choices Grim Basically the saying is that In the bay The odds are good The odds are good but the goods are odd The odds are good But the goods are odd
[00:46:09.110] 就像穿过鹅卵石之类的东西，或者被侵蚀，我不会撒谎，湾区的选择很残酷。基本上，人们常说，在湾区，机会很好，机会很好，但好东西却很少。机会很好，但好东西却很少。
[00:46:31.110] I must say I'm a pretty odd good And then the thing in New York In New York because there's less girls So the odds are bad But the goods are good Wait I'm gonna need to hear that again Or I guess To flip it would be like
[00:46:31.110] 我得说我挺古怪的，而且在纽约，因为纽约女孩少，所以机会不多，但条件不错。等等，我得再听一遍。或者，反过来说就像……
[00:46:49.110] The odds are Anyway It's basically flip In the bay the odds are good but the goods are odd In New York it's the opposite This is from a girl perspective right That's interesting because it's flipped for the guy Okay I have a final question for us all
[00:46:49.110] 总之，概率嘛，基本上是反过来的。在湾区，概率高，但机会少；在纽约，情况正好相反。这是从女生的角度来看的，对吧？这很有意思，因为对男生来说情况正好相反。好了，我最后一个问题想问问大家。
[00:47:05.110] Have you ever regretted a breakup Not for me Are you saying in the long run Just like in general Yeah like in the long run probably No not for me My really short term dating Like I said earlier right I do have some regrets there
[00:47:05.110] 你有没有后悔过分手？我没有。你是说从长远来看？就一般情况而言？嗯，从长远来看，可能吧。不，我没有。我指的是那些很短暂的恋爱关系。就像我之前说的，我确实有些后悔。
[00:47:23.110] But if I've given it time You know like multi-year relationships Then no No Yeah Not really for me I did once regret the time period that I broke up Oh I see Cause it was like finals week And I was like maybe I should have waited
[00:47:23.110] 但如果我给了它时间，你知道，就像那种多年的恋爱关系，那么不，不，是的，对我来说真的不是。我曾经后悔过分手的那段时间。哦，我明白了，因为当时正值期末考试周，我就想也许我应该再等等。
[00:47:43.110] Sorry I couldn't wait You probably didn't really study much But also I feel like sometimes a breakup can't wait Like you're just sitting there suffering For the sake of the other person Yes that's true cause it's like self-sacrificial If you choose to wait I think I agree though
[00:47:43.110] 抱歉我等不及了。你可能没怎么认真学习吧。不过我觉得有时候分手真的等不及了，就像你坐在那里默默承受痛苦，为了对方。没错，确实如此，因为这就像是一种自我牺牲。如果你选择等待，我想我同意你的看法。
[00:47:59.110] I also don't regret any breakups Which is good that means that we've all Learned and grown from our breakups Yeah I would say so I feel like you only regret it If you're the one that did the breaking up And like it was for a really stupid reason
[00:47:59.110] 我也不后悔任何一次分手，这很好，这意味着我们都从分手中吸取了教训，成长了。是的，我觉得只有当你主动提出分手，而且理由非常愚蠢的时候，你才会后悔。
[00:48:13.110] Yeah That's the only time really Well this has been an actually pretty long journey In terms of us physically being here In our living room Talking through all of our past breakups But it's been really enlightening And it's actually been a pretty positive And encouraging conversation
[00:48:13.110] 是的，那是唯一一次。其实，从我们坐在客厅里，聊起过去所有的分手经历来看，这真是一段相当漫长的旅程。但这真的很有启发性，而且也是一次非常积极和鼓舞人心的谈话。
