[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Sunny. I don't know if it comes across very obviously, but actually on this podcast, we are huge food lovers. And so this week's episode, we wanted to talk more about food. We thought it would be really fun to
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo，我是Sunny。我不知道大家有没有注意到，但实际上，我们这个播客的成员都是超级美食爱好者。所以这周的节目，我们想多聊聊美食。我们觉得这会非常有趣……
[00:00:29.740] talk about kind of like our relationship with food in the household versus we've talked about eating out before and like our experiences with that. But I think there's a whole different world of how you interact with food or like what kind of food you eat, what you cook, etc. when you look inside the household. So I guess a question to start us off would be what kind of food did you grow up eating
[00:00:29.740] 我们可以聊聊我们在家里和食物的关系，以及我们之前聊过的外出就餐的经历。但我认为，当你审视家庭内部时，你会发现一个完全不同的世界，它包含了你与食物的互动方式，比如你吃什么食物，你做什么菜等等。所以我想，首先我想问的是，你从小吃的是什么食物？
[00:00:55.960] a lot of? Maybe the main cuisine or what was like your favorite dish maybe that your parents made for you? So I grew up eating a lot of Korean food at home. I would say that it was the main cuisine that we ate. A Korean traditional like dinner plate in our household would look like a bowl of rice, usually white rice, a lot of different side dishes. So we always had at least like two pickled side dishes on
[00:00:55.960] 很多？也许是主食，或者你最喜欢的菜，比如你父母经常做的菜？我从小就在家吃很多韩国菜。我觉得韩国菜是我们家的主食。我们家传统的韩式餐盘里，通常会放一碗米饭，一般是白米饭，还有很多不同的小菜。所以我们家餐桌上至少会放两份腌菜。
[00:01:22.600] the table. And then there would be like a meat dish and maybe some sort of like vegetable dish steamed or something like that. But I do distinctively remember we would have themed nights. You know how like a lot of American people have like Taco Tuesday or something. So like for us, one of our special meals would be like baked potato night. Oh my god. So then my mom would bake a bunch of like russet potatoes and then we would put sour cream and cheese, butter, green onions and like bacon bits on it.
[00:01:22.600] 餐桌上会摆着肉菜，可能还会有一些蒸蔬菜之类的。但我清楚地记得我们家会搞主题之夜。你知道很多美国人都有“塔可星期二”之类的节日吗？我们家的特色菜之一就是烤土豆之夜。天哪！我妈会烤一大堆褐皮土豆，然后我们会在上面放酸奶油、奶酪、黄油、葱花和培根碎。
[00:01:49.200] And then another themed dinner would be like spaghetti. So my mom would put, you know, store bought marinara sauce onto spaghetti and then we would put like American cheese slices on it. Oh my god. It's so American of you. Right? And then I guess occasionally we would have steak too. Non-Korean cuisine was like the specialty or like an exciting night. And Korean was like the default. That's funny because I feel like our household was kind of the same. I would say at home on weekdays,
[00:01:49.200] 然后还有一次主题晚餐是意大利面。我妈会把超市买的番茄酱浇在意大利面上，然后我们再放上几片美式奶酪。我的天哪，这太美国化了，对吧？然后我想我们偶尔也会吃牛排。非韩式菜肴就像是特色菜或者特别期待的晚餐。韩式菜肴就像是家常便饭。这很有趣，因为我觉得我们家的情况也差不多。我会说，在工作日的家里，
[00:02:18.560] we usually had Chinese dishes paired with rice. Everyone would have their own bowl of rice. And then we would share like three main dishes of either meats or veggies. But we would also occasionally have like random, more Americanized, I would say meals mixed in. One of my mom's specialties, I feel like was baby back ribs. Oh. So randomly we would have that for dinner or like maybe a weekend
[00:02:18.560] 我们通常吃中式菜肴配米饭。每个人都有一碗米饭。然后我们会一起分享三道主菜，要么是肉，要么是蔬菜。但偶尔我们也会吃一些比较美式的菜肴。我妈妈的拿手菜之一，我觉得是烤猪肋排。哦。所以我们有时会突然在晚餐或周末吃这个。
[00:02:43.540] lunch. And then we would also sometimes have like pasta or salad and things like that. So it was very interesting, but I would say primarily raised eating like Chinese food at home. Yeah. I think I'm very similar to you all as well. Bowl of rice, shared veggies slash like meat or fish dishes or soups. Occasionally we would have like spaghetti. I think that was just the easiest American dish
[00:02:43.540] 午餐。然后我们有时也会吃意大利面、沙拉之类的。所以很有意思，但我主要还是在家吃中餐。是的。我觉得我和你们很像。一碗米饭，一些蔬菜，或者肉类、鱼类菜肴或汤。偶尔我们也会吃意大利面。我觉得那是最简单的美式菜肴了。
[00:03:10.640] to learn to cook, you know, all of that. It's not fancy like Italian style. It's just American style, you know. It was always exciting to eat American food because sometimes it was like, oh, this is what other people eat. Or it was just like very different, a nice break from what we're so used to. And I think also it's just maybe like more palatable for kids. You know how kids love like
[00:03:10.640] 学做饭什么的，你知道的，就是这些。它不像意大利菜那样精致，只是美式菜而已。吃美式食物总是让人兴奋，因为有时候会想，哦，原来别人都吃这个。或者只是感觉很不一样，让我们从习以为常的食物中解脱出来。而且我觉得，美式食物可能更受孩子们欢迎。你知道孩子们喜欢……
[00:03:38.940] chicken nuggets and like easy to eat stuff. So I think that was another part of it. Also, we would sometimes eat like Kraft dinner, the mac and cheese. Oh, yeah. Damn. I'm trying to remember if my parents liked mac and cheese. I think for us, the instant food go to is always like Korean ramen. My mom would make a bunch in a pot. I still don't know how she does it, but she makes her ramen really al dente. So then it tastes really good. Like the mouthfeel is really good. And I try to recreate
[00:03:38.940] 鸡块之类的方便食品。所以我觉得这也是原因之一。还有，我们有时候会吃卡夫晚餐（Kraft Dinner）的通心粉和奶酪。哦，对。哎。我努力回想我爸妈喜不喜欢通心粉和奶酪。我觉得我们家最常吃的速食永远是韩式拉面。我妈会煮一大锅。我到现在都不知道她是怎么做到的，但她煮的拉面特别劲道。所以味道特别好。口感特别棒。我也试着自己做出来。
[00:04:07.820] it to this day and I have no idea how she does it. It's funny that Sunny, you said that your mom had specialties and that's kind of how I see my parents cooking too. Like my dad's specialty is brunch. He can do like French toast and like scrambled eggs and omelets and stuff, but I've never seen him make any dish outside of like brunch breakfast. I'm like, dude, you do this so well. Like maybe you
[00:04:07.820] 直到今天，我还是不知道她是怎么做到的。桑妮，你说你妈妈有拿手菜，这很有意思，我觉得我爸妈做饭也差不多是这样。比如我爸的拿手菜是早午餐。他会做法式吐司、炒蛋、煎蛋卷之类的，但我从来没见过他做早午餐以外的菜。我就想，哥们儿，你这方面做得真好啊。也许你
[00:04:32.620] should venture out into other food. Crystal, when you brought up eating more American dishes and feeling like you're eating stuff that other kids were eating. That reminded me of school lunch and also the few times we would go out to our regular rotation of restaurants. I think one of the household staples was this restaurant called Sweet Tomatoes that no longer exists, sadly. But I think if you're raised on the West Coast, specifically in like California, I feel like this was a very common
[00:04:32.620] 应该尝试其他食物。克丽丝塔尔，你提到吃更多美式菜肴，感觉自己吃的都是其他孩子吃的东西，这让我想起了学校午餐，还有我们偶尔去常去的那几家餐厅。我记得我们家常去的一家叫“甜番茄”（Sweet Tomatoes）的餐厅，可惜现在已经关门了。但我觉得如果你在西海岸长大，尤其是在加州，这应该很常见。
[00:05:02.140] place for people to bring their families because it was super affordable and it was kind of like buffet style focused on salads and soups. And I feel like it was such a treat for us to go and the kids would just get the same few things. Like you would get like no salad, just get a bunch of soup, which was usually like chicken noodle soup or clam chowder. And then I would always love their blueberry muffins and I would like peel the top off and just eat like the crispy bit.
[00:05:02.140] 这里是人们带家人来的好去处，因为价格超级实惠，而且是自助餐形式，主打沙拉和汤。我觉得去那里对我们来说是一种享受，孩子们总是点那几样东西。比如，他们不点沙拉，只点汤，通常是鸡汤面或者蛤蜊浓汤。我最喜欢他们家的蓝莓松饼，我会把上面的酥皮剥掉，只吃酥脆的那一面。
[00:05:28.540] And then they also always had like three pastas on rotation. I feel like the other kids loved mac and cheese and I would usually eat like the spaghetti or something and then just like finish off with ice cream. And I feel like that was such a treat for us. And it was like very similar to the chicken nuggets or like pizza, nachos and whatever else they serve in elementary school. And those were like the occasional meals that I would only ever get outside of home.
[00:05:28.540] 他们家总是轮流供应三种意面。我觉得其他孩子都喜欢吃通心粉奶酪，而我通常会吃意大利面之类的，最后再来个冰淇淋。我觉得那对我们来说简直是莫大的享受。这跟小学里吃的鸡块、披萨、玉米片之类的食物很像。那些都是我偶尔才能在外面吃到的饭菜。
[00:05:56.780] Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's why like it always felt so special because I was like, oh, this is out of the norm. This is not the easiest thing to get. Not that it was like hard to obtain, but it's just that like it's not what our parents are comfortable making maybe. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like eating out with family felt so special. I mean, it's still like is a very nice fun activity to do. But I feel like as an adult making my own money, if I want to go out and eat
[00:05:56.780] 是啊，是啊。也许这就是为什么它总是感觉那么特别，因为我觉得，哦，这很特别。这不是那么容易得到的。倒不是说很难得到，只是感觉这不太符合我们父母的习惯。是啊，是啊。我觉得和家人一起出去吃饭感觉很特别。我的意思是，这仍然是一件非常美好的娱乐活动。但我觉得，作为一个成年人，自己赚钱，如果我想出去吃饭，
[00:06:25.140] out, I can and I will. But as a kid, you're kind of like subject to what your parents want to do that day. In the area that I grew up, there used to be this restaurant called Elephant Bar. And that was like, you know, to me, it felt very like luxurious. Like we're rich. We're spending money today. We would go and get like deep fried chili shrimp and, you know, other like Asian fusion dishes. And I would be like, this is like the best day ever. Dude, we had Elephant Bar too. Yes. I remember sometimes people
[00:06:25.140] 出去玩，我可以，而且我会。但小时候，你基本上得听父母的安排。在我长大的那片儿，以前有家叫“大象酒吧”的餐馆。你知道，对我来说，那感觉就像是奢侈的象征。感觉就像我们家有钱了，今天可以花钱了。我们会去吃炸辣椒虾之类的，还有其他一些亚洲融合菜。我会想，这简直是世界上最棒的一天。哥们儿，我们家也有“大象酒吧”啊。是的。我记得有时候人们
[00:06:54.940] would have their birthdays there and we were like, wow, this is like so fancy. Like what a grandiose meal. Right. Dude, did that place disappear? Is it gone now? Ours is gone. Ours is definitely gone. I do want to ask you guys about, I guess, the nutritional aspect of eating with your family, because now that I am trying to observe my health, I feel like I care a lot about like,
[00:06:54.940] 他们会在那里过生日，我们当时就觉得，哇，这也太高级了吧。简直就是一顿盛大的晚餐。对啊，那地方是不是消失了？现在没了？我们家那家没了。我们家那家肯定没了。我想问问你们，关于和家人一起吃饭的营养方面，因为我现在开始注意健康，感觉自己很在意这些，比如……
[00:07:21.300] oh, how much protein does this thing have? Or like, is this thing high in carbs? Or, you know, just like checking general macro levels, even if it's not in depth, knowing like, okay, these foods are kind of healthy. These foods are not. And looking back at the meals that you would have with your family, how would you rate them on like a nutritional scale? Do you think they were very healthy? Or are you kind of like, we didn't eat much protein back then? Surprisingly, I would say I grew up with a
[00:07:21.300] 哦，这个食物蛋白质含量多少？或者，这个食物碳水化合物含量高吗？或者，你知道，只是大致了解一下宏量营养素的含量，即使不是很深入地了解，也能知道哪些食物比较健康，哪些食物不太健康。回想一下你和家人一起吃的饭菜，你会如何评价它们的营养价值？你觉得它们很健康吗？还是你会觉得，我们那时候蛋白质摄入量很少？出乎意料的是，我会说我从小就……
[00:07:48.320] borderline almond mom. Like she was very into just like nutritional meals and being like fairly health conscious. So I feel like I was always raised to eat a lot of different types of foods, especially like meats and veggies, like be kind of open minded there. And I think she cooked like a pretty wide variety of vegetables. There were definitely certain limitations in the house. I think they loosened up the older I
[00:07:48.320] 我妈有点像个“杏仁妈妈”，特别注重营养均衡的饮食，也比较注重健康。所以我觉得我从小就被教育要吃各种各样的食物，尤其是肉类和蔬菜，在这方面要保持开放的心态。而且我觉得她做的蔬菜种类也挺丰富的。当然，家里肯定也有一些饮食限制。我觉得随着我长大，这些限制也逐渐放宽了。
[00:08:16.500] got. But definitely when I was really young, I remember like in early elementary school, a common breakfast item was cereal, milk and cereal. And I feel like all of my classmates and like what I would see on the shelves were like lucky charms, cookie, Chris, cinnamon toast crunch. And I remember my parents never buying that for our household, we would usually buy like low sugar or no sugar cereal. So like
[00:08:16.500] 明白了。但肯定的是，在我很小的时候，大概小学低年级的时候，常见的早餐是麦片、牛奶和麦片。我觉得我所有的同学，还有我在货架上看到的麦片，都是像幸运符麦片、曲奇麦片、克里斯麦片、肉桂吐司脆片之类的。我记得我父母从来不给我们家买这些，我们通常买低糖或无糖的麦片。
[00:08:41.880] cornflakes or Cheerios. So I feel like I was raised with like, that kind of level of awareness that like, oh, you shouldn't really have these. But I think I liked the way that they like slowly introduced them as I got older. So I knew like, you can have them within reason, but try to have more of a balanced diet and more of a balanced approach to eating. And I think one thing that they cared more about was just
[00:08:41.880] 玉米片或者麦圈。我觉得我从小就被灌输了这种观念，比如，哦，这些东西其实不应该吃。但我喜欢他们随着我长大慢慢引入这些食物的方式。所以我知道，适量食用是可以的，但要尽量保持均衡的饮食，采取更均衡的饮食方式。我觉得他们更关心的一点是……
[00:09:08.160] like, not having a ton of food waste. The concept of leftovers was like very much ingrained. Like if we didn't finish a certain dish, we'd probably see it the next day. So it was very common in our household to like, keep the dish in the fridge, reheat it the next day if it wasn't finished. So I think that's a habit that I've definitely carried over into adulthood too. Dude, did you ever get honey bunches of oats for cereal?
[00:09:08.160] 比如，我们家很少浪费食物。剩菜的概念根深蒂固。如果一道菜没吃完，第二天可能就还能吃到。所以，在我们家，把剩菜放冰箱里，如果没吃完第二天再加热，是很常见的做法。我觉得这个习惯我成年后也一直保持着。哥们儿，你吃过蜂蜜燕麦片吗？
[00:09:35.100] I feel like that was such a treat. I think my parents only bought that like once or twice. Dang. I feel like that was like a childhood favorite for so many people. Dude, yeah, my parents, I think they were still figuring out like, what cereal would be like, not overly sugary, sugary, but like, you know, not too plain, I guess, to the point where we would complain. So at some point,
[00:09:35.100] 我觉得那简直是种享受。我爸妈好像就买过一两次。哎。感觉那可是很多人的童年最爱啊。哥们儿，是啊，我爸妈当时还在摸索，到底什么样的麦片才算好吃，不能太甜，但也不能太淡，免得我们抱怨。所以，在某个时候，
[00:10:02.310] they ended up on honey bunches of oats. And then me and my brother loved it. We're like, dude, this cereal is so good. It is good. Objectively. How are you, Crystal? How would you rate your parents' meals growing up? Honestly, they're like, pretty balanced. I've noticed as I've gotten older and like, helped more in the kitchen or just like, observed my mom cook more,
[00:10:02.310] 他们最后吃了蜂蜜燕麦片。然后我和我弟弟都爱上了它。我们当时就说，哇，这麦片太好吃了。确实好吃。客观来说。克丽丝塔尔，你好吗？你觉得你小时候父母做的饭菜怎么样？说实话，我觉得挺均衡的。我注意到，随着我长大，也越来越多地在厨房帮忙，或者只是观察我妈妈做饭，
[00:10:27.010] that she's always thinking like, oh, we need to have at least one like, veggie dish and one like, protein dish, you know, just to make sure we're getting whatever we need, our energy and stuff. But yeah, I think she doesn't think of it too complicated. It's pretty much that like, veggies, protein, and some rice, if anyone wants. There was this other meal that I love to have when I was a kid, which is just like ramen, honestly.
[00:10:27.010] 她总是想着，哦，我们至少得准备一份蔬菜和一份蛋白质菜，你知道，这样才能确保我们摄入足够的营养，比如能量什么的。不过，我觉得她并没有把这想得太复杂。基本上就是蔬菜、蛋白质，还有米饭，如果有人想吃的话。我小时候还特别喜欢吃另一种东西，说实话，就是拉面。
[00:10:54.810] Me and my brother, I remember we would like, chant when my mom was like, when she's like, oh, today, like, I'm tired. We're just going to eat ramen. And then my brother were like, dude, ramen. Yes. That was your chant? No, it was like in Chinese. It's called like, fong bian mian. So we'd be like, fong bian mian. Something like that. So cute.
[00:10:54.810] 我和我哥，我记得我们俩以前会念叨，就是我妈说“哎呀，今天好累，咱们就吃拉面吧”的时候。然后我哥就会说：“哥们儿，拉面啊！”对啊。你们念叨的就是这个？不，是用中文念的。好像叫“吃面”。所以我们就会念“吃面”。大概是这个意思。真可爱。
[00:11:20.150] But like, my mom hated serving that to us because she felt like it was pretty lazy and like, not the healthiest meal. And she knew that we loved it. So she was like, oh, if I serve it to them too much, they'll always want it. And it's just like unhealthy to always eat that. Unfortunately, that meant more work for her to like, you know, keep cooking these relatively healthy meals. It's sort of interesting for me when I look back at the meals that I used to eat with my family,
[00:11:20.150] 但是，我妈妈很讨厌给我们做那种饭菜，因为她觉得那样太随便，而且也不太健康。她知道我们很喜欢吃，所以她就想，如果我老是做，他们就会一直想吃。老吃那种饭菜也不健康。不幸的是，这意味着她要花更多时间，才能继续做那些相对健康的饭菜。回想起以前和家人一起吃的那些饭菜，我觉得挺有意思的。
[00:11:46.650] because in the way that I think of health and like meals and nutrition as an American, I think it's kind of a different approach than like how like an older generation or, you know, parents who immigrated from Asia would view nutrition and health. Because I would think, okay, protein, veggie, kind of like what you were saying, Crystal, try to like think of the general like holistic view. But then if I think back to the things that my parents would say about food, it would be like, oh, let's eat fish.
[00:11:46.650] 因为作为一个美国人，我对健康、膳食和营养的理解，和老一辈人，或者说从亚洲移民来的父母，看待营养和健康的方式不太一样。我会想，好吧，蛋白质、蔬菜，就像你刚才说的，Crystal，尽量从整体的角度去考虑。但如果我回想一下我父母对食物的看法，他们会说，哦，我们吃鱼吧。
[00:12:15.990] It's healthy because it's really high in like omega-3s and like DHA. And you know, like very specific and like niche things that make food healthy, and not just like the general categories that it lives in. So I do think that I grew up eating a balanced diet. And my parents were pretty lax about like, if we crave something one day, let's eat it. But in like the total view, I felt like the foods that they were choosing to make were always healthy, just not in the ways that I would like think of it or define it today. Okay.
[00:12:15.990] 它之所以健康，是因为它富含omega-3和DHA之类的营养素。你知道，健康食物的成分有很多，而且都是一些非常具体的、比较特殊的营养素，而不仅仅是它通常被归类的那些营养素。所以我认为我从小就吃得很均衡。我父母在这方面比较宽松，比如，如果我们哪天想吃什么，就吃吧。但总的来说，我觉得他们选择做的食物一直都很健康，只是健康的方式和我今天理解的或定义的健康方式不太一样。好的。
[00:12:46.550] Now that I think about it, though, there was probably some sacrifice that our parents made. Because I think low-key my dad likes fast food. And we would sometimes get it. And it was like a treat for everyone. Because like, then no one has to cook. Everyone's going to enjoy the meal. And it's like pretty quick and easy. But deep down, my parents knew it wasn't the healthiest meal. It wasn't a regular thing. Like my dad loves Big Macs.
[00:12:46.550] 现在想想，我爸妈可能也为此做出了一些牺牲。因为我觉得我爸其实挺喜欢快餐的。我们偶尔也会吃，对大家来说就像是一种享受。这样就不用做饭了，大家都能吃得开心，而且也方便快捷。但其实我爸妈心里清楚，快餐并不健康，也不是经常吃。比如，我爸就特别爱吃巨无霸。
[00:13:15.090] So like going to get McDonald's was always very exciting. But of course, they kept in mind it was like, oh, we have like growing children. We can't always give into every single craving. But you know, once in a while is nice. Kind of like what you said, Jisoo. Dude, speaking of growing children, did your parents like force dairy upon you when you were young? Absolutely. I drank a glass of milk every day growing up, which is probably why I'm tall.
[00:13:15.090] 所以去麦当劳总是让人很兴奋。当然，他们也考虑到，哦，我们家孩子正在长身体。我们不可能总是满足他们每一个馋嘴的欲望。但你知道，偶尔一次也挺好的。就像你说的，Jisoo。哥们，说到孩子长身体，你小时候你爸妈是不是强迫你喝牛奶？当然。我从小每天都喝一杯牛奶，可能这就是我个子高的原因吧。
[00:13:45.150] I mean, it could also be many other reasons like genetics. But I didn't realize like that wasn't a thing for everyone. Because I also have a lot of friends who grew up drinking milk every day. And I feel like it was just such a common thing for our generation. And I think I only stopped doing that maybe in like high school. Kind of crazy. We even got milk for like our lunches, didn't we? Yes. Yeah.
[00:13:45.150] 我的意思是，也可能是其他很多原因，比如遗传。但我之前没意识到这并不是每个人都有的习惯。因为我也有很多朋友从小就每天喝牛奶。我觉得这在我们这代人里是很普遍的事情。我好像直到高中才停止喝牛奶。真是不可思议。我们甚至午餐都喝牛奶，对吧？是的。没错。
[00:14:13.850] I don't know if you guys had this, but in elementary school, instead of like getting school lunches, everyone had to bring their own lunch. But we could put in a milk order. So it was like every day you get milk. It's so interesting. And you pay like 100 bucks for the quarter or something. Or I mean, that seems expensive. So it was probably cheaper than that. Yeah. It was like you could choose either chocolate milk or regular milk. Oh my God. Wait, did it come in bags?
[00:14:13.850] 不知道你们有没有过这种经历，小学的时候，学校不提供午餐，每个人都得自己带。不过我们可以订牛奶。所以每天都能喝到牛奶。挺有意思的。好像一瓶牛奶要100块钱，或者差不多吧。我是说，这听起来很贵。所以实际价格可能比这便宜。对啊。你可以选择巧克力牛奶或者原味牛奶。我的天哪。等等，牛奶是袋装的吗？
[00:14:44.010] Because Canada, you guys drink like milk in bags, right? Okay. The bagged milk thing is bag milk is instead of carton, big carton of milk, it's a big bag of milk. And then you like cut the corner and you put it in the bag holder and then you pour it out like a carton almost. But like the milk that we got at school was just like a small carton. And it was like daily delivery at lunchtime. Milk's here. Then we get our milk. That's so cute. Dude.
[00:14:44.010] 因为加拿大，你们喝的牛奶都是袋装的，对吧？好的。袋装牛奶就是用袋子装的，而不是纸盒装的，一大盒牛奶。然后你把袋子一角剪开，放进袋子里，再像倒纸盒装牛奶一样倒出来。但是我们在学校喝的牛奶就是一小盒。每天中午送来。牛奶到了。然后我们就喝牛奶。真可爱。哥们儿。
[00:15:12.410] I like hated milk so much growing up. So whenever, I mean, usually my mom would pack my lunch, but some days like I would go and like buy school lunch. And then when it came with a carton of milk, I would always throw it away or like give it to someone. I think when I was younger, I was like more sensitive to like smell certain tastes. The smell of milk or creamy things like cream of mushroom soup, it would literally make me like gag and like start to throw up. So then I like hated drinking milk.
[00:15:12.410] 我从小就特别讨厌牛奶。所以，通常情况下，我妈会给我准备午餐，但有时候我会自己去买学校的午餐。如果午餐里有盒牛奶，我总是会把它扔掉或者给别人。我觉得我小时候对某些味道特别敏感，闻到牛奶或者像奶油蘑菇汤那种浓稠的味道，就会让我恶心想吐。所以，我特别讨厌喝牛奶。
[00:15:41.070] And the only way my parents would get me to drink milk was to put Nesquik in it. Because when you put Nesquik in milk, I'm sure you guys know this, but not everything dissolves. So then you get these like little crunchy bits in the milk and that texture, like I would crave it so much. So then that was like the only way that I got in all of my dairy nutrients. Wait, that's so funny. For some reason, I think around junior high, I started to like not love milk.
[00:15:41.070] 我爸妈唯一能让我喝牛奶的办法就是在牛奶里加雀巢巧克力粉。因为我知道，把雀巢巧克力粉加到牛奶里，它不会完全溶解。所以牛奶里会残留一些脆脆的小颗粒，那种口感，我特别喜欢。那时候，这几乎是我摄取所有乳制品营养的唯一途径。等等，这太搞笑了。不知道为什么，大概到了初中，我开始对牛奶没那么喜欢了。
[00:16:08.070] So the only way I would drink it was, yeah, with Nesquik. But I didn't like those crunchy bits. What? I was like fighting for my life, trying to squish the crunchy bits out so that everything dissolved. No. So that it was fully chocolate milk. Damn. But then eventually I gave up. So I was like, mom, dad, I'm quitting milk. And they're like, okay. Then you lived a post milk life. Were you a chocolate milk or regular milk person, Sunny?
[00:16:08.070] 所以，我唯一会喝牛奶的方式就是加雀巢巧克力粉。但我讨厌那些脆脆的颗粒。什么？我当时简直拼了命，拼命想把那些颗粒挤掉，好让牛奶完全溶解。不，就是想让它变成纯巧克力牛奶。真是的。但最终我还是放弃了。我就跟爸妈说，我要戒牛奶了。他们就说，好吧。然后你就过上了戒牛奶后的生活。桑妮，你是喜欢喝巧克力牛奶还是普通牛奶呢？
[00:16:38.370] I was just going to say, I feel like I was the only kid who did not like chocolate milk. Oh my God. Like, you know how when you go on the lunch line and then they have the cartons of like regular versus chocolate milk, I always pick the regular milk. And I feel like every time I tried like my friends or maybe my parents tried to buy it once or twice, but I think I just like never liked it. But I also don't really like chocolate in general. So that checks out. I wonder if it's because your mom was pretty health conscious in the household.
[00:16:38.370] 我正想说，我觉得我好像是唯一一个不喜欢巧克力牛奶的孩子。天哪。你知道吗，在学校食堂排队的时候，他们会把普通牛奶和巧克力牛奶放在不同的盒子里，我总是选普通牛奶。我觉得每次我尝试的时候，我的朋友或者我父母都买过一两次巧克力牛奶，但我好像就是不喜欢。而且我本来就不太喜欢巧克力。所以这也能解释得通。我猜是不是因为你妈妈在家比较注重健康饮食吧。
[00:17:07.550] Well, I guess this is a bigger question. Did you guys have snacks in the household? Ooh. Yeah, that's a great question. So we did have snacks, but I would say they were fairly healthy, but then there would be like randomly unhealthy stuff mixed in. So it's really hard to say. Like, I think growing up, do you remember those like tubes of chips? Those were really popular. They had like those Cheetos asteroids. And they also had like lay stacks. Right.
[00:17:07.550] 嗯，我想这算是个更大的问题。你们家有零食吗？哦，对，问得好。我们家确实有零食，我觉得大部分都比较健康，但偶尔也会混杂一些不健康的零食。所以很难说。比如，你小时候记得那种管装薯片吗？那种薯片很流行。有像奇多小行星形状的，还有乐事薯片。对。
[00:17:35.990] So my parents would, and I think primarily my mom, she would buy those. But I think the rest of our snacks tended to be like rice crackers that you could buy from like an Asian grocery store, which I think are a little bit healthier than like just chips. Yeah. And I think we were raised eating a lot of fruit for snacks too. If we would come home from school, our snack would sometimes be like, yeah, some fruits and then maybe some pantry snacks.
[00:17:35.990] 所以，我爸妈会买那些，我觉得主要是我妈会买。但我们其他的零食通常是像米饼之类的，那种在亚洲超市就能买到的，我觉得比薯片之类的健康一些。是的。而且我觉得我们从小就经常吃水果当零食。放学回家后，我们的零食有时候就是一些水果，然后可能还会吃一些家里剩下的零食。
[00:18:01.370] But it was never like, there were some things that were specifically kind of off limits where I never saw my parents buy like Oreos, which I think were like really popular. And then I don't think we would ever get like just bags of candy. So I feel like when classmates or like other friends at school had them, I definitely just like took a few and it's such a treat. So no one, not a ton of unhealthy snacks, but what was interesting was like Crystal, you
[00:18:01.370] 但从来没有什么东西是被明确禁止的，比如我从没见过我爸妈买过奥利奥，我觉得奥利奥当时很受欢迎。而且我觉得我们家也从来不会买一大包糖果。所以我觉得当同学或者其他朋友有糖果的时候，我肯定会拿几块，那感觉真是太棒了。所以，我们家并没有吃很多不健康的零食，但有趣的是，就像克丽丝塔尔（Crystal）说的，你
[00:18:30.730] earlier, you mentioned like your parents would sometimes get fast food. And I feel like fast food was actually like occasionally allowed in our household too. Maybe in the summer after like a swimming lesson, we would like just go to the McDonald's drive-thru. And my parents were like very open to getting McDonald's and Burger King. And I wonder if it's because like as an immigrant, this is their first time experiencing like American fast food too. So it's like maybe also a treat for them. So I don't know. It was really interesting. Oh my God.
[00:18:30.730] 你之前提到过你父母偶尔会吃快餐。我觉得我们家偶尔也会吃快餐。比如夏天游泳课之后，我们可能会去麦当劳的得来速买点东西。我父母对麦当劳和汉堡王都挺乐意的。我在想，是不是因为他们是移民，这也是他们第一次体验美式快餐，所以对他们来说可能也是一种享受。我也不知道。这真的很有意思。我的天哪。
[00:18:59.470] Did you have the like Haw Flakes snack? Yes. I was going to say, I feel like there are like a few staple snacks that can be bought like at Asian grocery stores that we always had in the pantry. And yes, Haw Flakes, like they're this teeny tiny little like paper wrapped circular round flat snack that is made from like the Hawthorne, right? Like Hawthorne berry or something? Yeah. And they were really tasty.
[00:18:59.470] 你吃过山楂片那种零食吗？吃过。我正想说，我觉得有些常备零食，比如在亚洲超市就能买到的那种，我们家食品柜里总是备着。对，山楂片，就是那种用纸包着的小小的圆形扁平零食，是用山楂做的，对吧？山楂果之类的？对。真的很好吃。
[00:19:25.990] I actually think it's like mostly sugar, which is just like disguised as like fruit. It's a fruit. Like dried fruit or something. Dude. Yeah. We always had that as well. I think it was just like a really cheap and easy, like sweet snack to give kids that didn't feel too guilty about like giving it to them. But I remember we had so much of it that at one point I was like, dude, like, can we get something new?
[00:19:25.990] 我觉得它其实主要成分就是糖，只不过伪装成水果而已。它其实就是水果，就像干果之类的。哥们儿，对啊。我们家以前也一直有这玩意儿。我觉得它就是那种很便宜很方便的甜零食，给孩子吃的时候也不会觉得太有罪恶感。但我记得我们家这玩意儿太多了，有一次我就跟哥们儿说，哥们儿，咱们能不能换点儿别的？
[00:19:54.190] I think I would try to trade that snack with other people at like Chinese school. Oh my gosh. What about like ice cream? Did you guys have those pints of ice cream in your freezer or maybe like ice cream bars? So for our family, yeah, ice cream was very much a thing. We would have pints. I feel like my parents really liked Haagen-Dazs. Ooh. And I think for kids we were into ice cream, but we were also really into like popsicles.
[00:19:54.190] 我想我会在中文学校跟其他人交换那种零食。天哪。冰淇淋呢？你们家冰箱里是不是经常有整桶整桶的冰淇淋，或者冰棍之类的？对我们家来说，冰淇淋可是家常便饭。我们经常买整桶的。我觉得我爸妈特别喜欢哈根达斯。哦。我觉得我们小时候不仅爱吃冰淇淋，也爱吃冰棍之类的。
[00:20:24.170] Like I feel like it was so fun to just like eat as a kid. So we would always have like those fruit bars and I particularly like like the strawberry one. But yeah, I think ice cream was allowed. I wouldn't say we had it every day or anything, but it was definitely like a treat for us. And I feel like it was regularly stocked in our freezer. I feel like I'm now realizing I'm like we had healthy habits for like most of our main like recurring meals, like dinners and lunches.
[00:20:24.170] 我觉得小时候吃东西真的很有趣。我们经常吃水果条，我特别喜欢草莓味的。对了，我觉得冰淇淋也是可以吃的。虽然不是每天都吃，但绝对是偶尔的奖励。而且我觉得我们家冰箱里总是备着冰淇淋。我现在意识到，我们家大部分正餐，比如午餐和晚餐，都保持着健康的饮食习惯。
[00:20:53.330] But then I think we had some sprinkled in treats here and there. So it wasn't completely health only. Things are in moderation, but. But ice cream is a lot. Yeah, but ice cream is a yes. Ice cream and fast food are a yes. Ice cream must have been one of your parents' weaknesses. True. To this day, they always still have ice cream in the freezer. You could be right.
[00:20:53.330] 但我觉得我们偶尔也会吃点零食。所以也不完全是健康饮食。凡事都要适度，但是……冰淇淋确实很多。是啊，冰淇淋是可以吃的。冰淇淋和快餐都是可以吃的。冰淇淋一定是你父母的软肋之一。没错。直到今天，他们的冰箱里还总是备着冰淇淋。你说的有道理。
[00:21:18.410] I think actually what's funny about ice cream is when I was younger, I think we had it stocked a little less often than we have it stocked now. Now, whenever I go home, my mom's like, dude, Crystal, I just bought hella ice cream. Like help yourself. Like popsicles, like pint of ice cream. Like it's all there. I'm like, OK. But when I was younger, I think it was a little more spark, like spaced out. Sometimes we didn't have it. Sometimes it would be like a nice treat.
[00:21:18.410] 我觉得冰淇淋最有趣的地方在于，我小时候家里买冰淇淋的频率远不如现在。现在，每次回家，我妈都会说：“克丽丝塔尔，我刚买了一大堆冰淇淋！” 就像随便吃一样。有冰棍，有整整一品脱的冰淇淋。应有尽有。我就说：“好吧。” 但小时候，我觉得吃冰淇淋就像是件稀松平常的事，有时候家里根本没冰淇淋。有时候，吃上冰淇淋就像是一种难得的享受。
[00:21:46.750] And they like buy a box of popsicles or something. But yeah, my dad loves ice cream. Dude, he goes through like three or four popsicles in like one sitting. Holy. Dude, I know. It's insane. My mom's always like, Crystal, don't tell dad yet. But I got popsicles or like I got ice cream. So like you should you should eat some now before he finds out. And like it all disappears. Oh, my God.
[00:21:46.750] 他们会买一盒冰棍什么的。不过，我爸超爱吃冰淇淋。他一口气能吃三四根冰棍。我的天哪。我知道，太疯狂了。我妈总是说：“克丽丝塔尔，先别告诉爸爸。我买了冰棍或者冰淇淋，你趁他还没发现赶紧吃点儿。”然后，那些冰棍就全没了。我的天哪。
[00:22:13.450] You know, actually, that's a good point because my parents are also big ice cream lovers. I think in general, my mom has a weakness for snacking. So then whenever we went grocery shopping, she would come back with like one or two snacks for herself, one or two snacks for me. And it would just be like a part of what we do when we like watch TV or hang out or something for ice cream specifically. Like my parents have very different styles of ice cream that they would like.
[00:22:13.450] 你知道吗，这确实是个好主意，因为我爸妈也超爱吃冰淇淋。我觉得我妈特别爱吃零食。所以每次我们去超市买东西，她都会给自己买一两样零食，也给我买一两样。吃冰淇淋好像成了我们一起看电视、闲逛或者做其他事情时的一种习惯。我爸妈喜欢的冰淇淋口味跟我爸妈很不一样。
[00:22:38.590] And low key, I think it's like strategic in a sense, because my mom would buy red bean ice cream, which she knows my dad won't touch. And then she'll buy my dad his caramel ice cream bars that she doesn't like. And then she would buy me like whatever soda flavored like popsicle or something. So then we would each have like our own little bags of ice cream pops in the freezer. And we were all just like one happy family. There was no competition, you know.
[00:22:38.590] 说实话，我觉得这其实是一种策略，因为我妈会买红豆冰淇淋，她知道我爸肯定不吃。然后她还会买我爸爱吃的焦糖冰淇淋，虽然她自己也不爱吃。之后她会给我买各种口味的汽水，比如冰棍味的之类的。这样我们每个人的冰箱里就都有一小袋冰棍了。我们一家人就像一个幸福的家庭，彼此之间没有任何竞争。
[00:23:06.250] Wow, the concept of like not having to share. It's crazy. Oh my God, so true. Because Sunny has two siblings. You know, in a perfect world, I think that could work with my family too. Except low key, my dad just eats anything. Like sometimes he eats a bunch of stuff and he's just like, I don't even know what I ate, but like it was lit. And we're like, dude.
[00:23:06.250] 哇，不用分享的感觉真棒。太不可思议了。我的天，说得太对了。因为Sunny有两个兄弟姐妹。你知道，如果一切顺利的话，我觉得这套方法也适用于我家。不过说实话，我爸什么都吃。有时候他会吃一大堆东西，然后说：“我都不知道自己吃了什么，但味道超赞。” 我们就会说：“老兄，你这人也太能吃了吧。”
[00:23:34.470] During COVID, I was living with my parents and I think I had bought like a six pack of like some random fancy craft beer or something. And then my dad was like, he just like took one one day and he was like, oh, there's just beer here. And he started drinking it. And then he like, you know, over the course of whatever, a couple of weeks or whatever, he ended up drinking a decent amount of it. And then I was like, wait, like what's happening to this beer that I bought? And he was like, oh, I've been drinking it because like I like beer. I was like, oh, did you like it?
[00:23:34.470] 疫情期间，我和父母住在一起，我记得我买了一箱六瓶装的，好像是那种不知名的精酿啤酒之类的。然后有一天，我爸拿起一瓶，说：“哦，这儿有啤酒啊。”然后他就开始喝了。你知道，大概过了几个星期吧，他喝了不少。然后我就问他：“等等，我买的这些啤酒怎么了？” 他说：“哦，我一直在喝，因为我喜欢啤酒。” 我问他：“哦，你喜欢喝吗？”
[00:24:04.510] It's like kind of fancy. And he was like, wait, what? It just tastes like beer. And I was like, oh my God. And then I was like, okay, you know what? Like maybe you should go drink like Bud Light or something. So I would buy like a decoy beer that was like just, you know, whatever. The label just says beer on it. Like some basic thing, right?
[00:24:04.510] 这玩意儿看起来挺高级的。然后他就说，等等，什么？这不就是啤酒的味道吗？我当时就想，我的天哪。然后我就说，好吧，你知道吗？也许你应该去喝点百威淡啤之类的。所以我就会买那种看起来很普通的啤酒，你知道，就是那种标签上只写着“啤酒”的普通啤酒。就是那种很普通的啤酒，对吧？
[00:24:32.780] And then like the craft beers I would try to hide to the back of the fridge. That kind of reminds me, were there certain roles in the family where like someone would eat all the leftovers or someone would be responsible for eating certain parts of a dish that maybe you as a kid wouldn't eat? Like how did you all approach that growing up? Dude, I actually had a really funny role when I was younger.
[00:24:32.780] 然后就像我会把精酿啤酒藏到冰箱最里面一样。这让我想起，你们家是不是也有某种角色分工，比如有人负责吃剩菜剩饭，或者有人负责吃掉菜里你小时候不爱吃的部分？你们小时候是怎么处理这类事情的？哥们儿，我小时候其实也扮演过一个挺搞笑的角色。
[00:24:59.470] And I think it's because with our baby teeth, sometimes it's like harder to chew stuff. I guess I was just like, dude, I love fat, like the fat on meats and stuff like that. If you think about it, it makes sense. It's like, you know, it's really fatty. It's like really flavorful and it's easy to chew. Right. So my parents were like, dude, perfect. That is so easy. Like just give Crystal all the like fat parts of me and we can get all the lean parts.
[00:24:59.470] 我觉得是因为我们还长着乳牙，有时候咀嚼东西比较困难。我当时就想，老兄，我超爱吃肥肉，比如肉上的肥肉之类的。仔细想想，这很合理。你知道，肥肉很油腻，味道也很浓郁，而且容易咀嚼。对吧？所以我爸妈就说，老兄，太好了。这简直太方便了。只要把我身上肥肉的部分都给克丽丝塔尔，我们就能吃到瘦肉了。
[00:25:29.050] You know, like not as fattening, I guess. And it was great for a while. But then as I got older, I guess like my palate changed a bit. And I was like, okay, low key, I don't really like these fat parts anymore. But I don't know how to break it to my family. You're like, I don't want to disappoint them. But eventually I voiced out my change in appetite.
[00:25:29.050] 你知道，就是没那么容易发胖之类的。一开始感觉还不错。但随着年龄增长，我的口味好像也变了。然后我就想，好吧，其实我不太喜欢吃那些肥肉了。但我不知道该怎么跟家人说。你会想，我不想让他们失望。但最终我还是跟他们说了我的食欲变化。
[00:25:56.130] And they were like, damn, what are we going to do with all these fat bits now? There was definitely a long phase where I was just devouring everyone's like unwanted parts of the meal. I feel like every household has and needs some sort of person like that. For us, our family was obviously very small because I'm an only child. If there were any leftovers at the table, my dad would eat it.
[00:25:56.130] 他们当时就想，天哪，这些剩菜剩饭怎么办？确实有一段时间，我把大家吃剩的都吃光了。我觉得每个家庭都需要这样的人。我们家人口很少，因为我是独生子女。如果餐桌上有剩菜，我爸就会吃掉。
[00:26:19.690] But the funny part is my parents have very different approaches to like how they want a dinner to go. So my mom is kind of like maybe normal to quick speed of an eater. And my dad is a very slow eater. Like he wants to eat European, like Spanish style, you know, with like four hour dinners, like sipping wine, like chatting, talking to everyone around the dinner table.
[00:26:19.690] 但有趣的是，我父母对晚餐的习惯截然不同。我妈妈吃饭速度中等偏快，而我爸爸则吃得很慢。他喜欢吃欧式或西班牙式的晚餐，你知道，那种长达四个小时的晚餐，一边品酒，一边和餐桌上的每个人聊天。
[00:26:44.510] So then my mom would eat in like 20 minutes and then just like sit there and be like, I don't want to talk anymore. Like, can you hurry up? And then my dad would sit for like next three hours. You know, as he's talking, me and my mom were just kind of like sitting there. So we would like eat a little bit of the food. And then at the end, my dad would be like, oh, there's no more food left on the table. And then he would just like finish all the like scraps of each dish.
[00:26:44.510] 所以，我妈大概二十分钟就吃完了，然后就坐在那儿，说：“我不想说话了，你能不能快点？” 然后我爸就坐在那儿，一坐就是三个小时。你知道，他说话的时候，我和我妈就坐在那儿，就吃一点点。最后，我爸会说：“哦，桌上没东西了。” 然后他就把每道菜剩下的都吃光。
[00:27:08.590] I think like over the years and especially since I don't live with them anymore, like we don't do as long of a dinner. And I noticed that my dad has started eating quicker. But when I go to eat dinners with like James's family, for example, I noticed that I'm the slow eater and I'm the one who like talks more. And I'm like, oh, my God, this is like passed down to me. And I want to tell people like, guys, trust me, in my household, I'm on the faster side.
[00:27:08.590] 我觉得这些年来，尤其是我现在不和他们住在一起了，我们吃晚饭的时间也变短了。我注意到我爸吃饭的速度变快了。但是，比如我去和詹姆斯一家吃饭的时候，我发现我反而吃得慢，而且话也更多。我就想，天哪，这好像是遗传给我的。我想告诉大家，相信我，在我们家，我吃饭速度算是很快的。
[00:27:38.650] That's funny. You're right, though. Like James is a really fast eater. So I imagine at home they're probably like wolfing down their food. And then you're like, do we not just start eating? I'm just like impressed. I'm like, how are you guys talking and then also eating like at the same time in the same breath? Like for me, it's like two separate actions. How about you, Sunny? Do you have a specific role in your family? I would say not really.
[00:27:38.650] 真有意思。不过你说得对。詹姆斯吃饭真的很快。所以我猜他们在家肯定狼吞虎咽。然后你就会想，我们为什么不也开始吃呢？我真是佩服得五体投地。我就想，你们是怎么一边说话一边吃饭的？感觉就像一口气说完一样？对我来说，这完全是两个独立的动作。桑妮，你呢？你在家里有特别的角色吗？我觉得没有。
[00:28:08.470] But it's funny that you talk about like speed of eating because I feel like as a family, we would always sit down at the table to eat together. Like every night that was like very much a thing. But I do think that it was not an hour or multi-hour event. It was just like something to do on the checklist. It was like everyone sit down, eat your meal. We as kids didn't have to like clean up too much. It was just like put your stuff in the sink and then other people will do the rest of the cleaning.
[00:28:08.470] 但你说到吃饭速度，这很有意思，因为我觉得我们家以前总是会一起坐在餐桌旁吃饭。几乎每天晚上都是如此。但我觉得吃饭并不是什么耗时一小时甚至几个小时的事情。它就像是待办事项清单上的一项任务。大家坐下来，各自吃饭。我们小时候不用收拾太多东西。只要把东西放到水槽里，剩下的就交给其他人来收拾就行了。
[00:28:37.030] So I would say we also ate fairly quickly and then just like had short conversations and then just called it a day. There wasn't anything in particular I was like responsible for. But I would say my dad similarly was the one to eat all of the things that no one else wanted to eat. And he embraced that role. Okay. But did you and your siblings fight over food? Were you like, oh God, I need to like hurry up and scoop half of this dish into my plate or bowl before someone else gets all of it?
[00:28:37.030] 所以我觉得我们吃得也挺快的，然后就简单聊几句，就结束了一天的饭。我倒没做什么特别的责任。不过我爸也差不多，总是吃那些别人不想吃的东西。他欣然接受了这个角色。好吧。那你和你的兄弟姐妹会为了食物争吵吗？你会不会觉得，天哪，我得赶紧把这道菜的一半盛到我的盘子或碗里，免得被别人全吃光了？
[00:29:06.350] You know, that's interesting that you ask because I don't remember ever feeling that way during like dinner. But I definitely felt that way about snacks. Like that was a very common thing in the household, like fighting over snacks. Something I remember in particular is, again, when my mom would buy those, just like either bags of chips or like the Lay's stacks, even just like rice crackers, anything like that.
[00:29:06.350] 你知道吗，你问这个问题很有意思，因为我记不清自己吃饭的时候有没有过这种感觉。但我对零食确实有这种感觉。在家里，为了零食争吵是很常见的事。我特别记得，我妈买的那些零食，不管是薯片还是乐事薯片，甚至是米饼之类的，都会让我很生气。
[00:29:31.170] My brothers would do this thing where they would eat 90% of the container and leave me like two chips and then just like wrap it, wrap it back up and like put a rubber band on it. But you would never know, especially in like those tubes until you open it. So I would like go and get a snack and I would like open the pantry, take out the tube and I would look inside and there would be literally like a chip and a half. And I would lose my mind every time.
[00:29:31.170] 我哥哥们会干这种事：他们会吃掉90%的薯片，只给我留两片，然后把剩下的部分包起来，再用橡皮筋扎好。你根本看不出来，尤其是那种管状包装，不打开根本看不出来。所以每次我去拿零食，打开食品柜，拿出薯片管，一看里面就只有一片半。每次看到都让我抓狂。
[00:29:59.830] I feel like I have had like many tantrums over this. Oh my God. So not fighting over food at the dinner table, but definitely fighting over snacks. Dude, that's so fucked up. So I would also lose my mind. Oh my God. Did you and Max fight over food at the dinner table? I don't know if Max was an active participant, but I think I was fighting a little bit. It's a one-sided beat. Yeah. You're creating problems for yourself.
[00:29:59.830] 我觉得我为了这事儿都发过好几次脾气了。我的天哪。不是在餐桌上为了饭菜吵架，但肯定会为了零食吵架。老兄，这也太扯了吧。我也会因此抓狂的。我的天哪。你和Max在餐桌上为了饭菜吵架了吗？我不知道Max有没有主动参与，但我感觉我有点儿跟他吵。这完全是一边倒的局面。是啊。你这是在给自己找麻烦。
[00:30:31.530] I think like I really like tofu skin. And so sometimes like that would be in one of the dishes and I would literally like just pick those out. And my mom's like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? And I don't think my brother was like very worried, but I was out here trying to pick them all out into my bowl. That's so funny. I feel like as an only child, I don't have much experience fighting over stuff. But there was this one thing where there's this Korean soup called Cheonggookjang.
[00:30:31.530] 我觉得我特别喜欢豆腐皮。所以有时候菜里会有豆腐皮，我就会故意挑出来。我妈就会说：“你他妈在干嘛？” 我哥好像不太在意，但我当时就想把它们全挑到我的碗里。想想就觉得好笑。我觉得作为独生子女，我没什么争抢东西的经验。不过有一次，我吃了一种叫清麵酱的韩国汤，就因为这个跟人争抢过。
[00:31:00.810] It's basically like soybean soup, but extra fermented. So it's a little stinky. And then the way that my family likes to eat it is the soybeans are intact. So like it's in the soup kind of like settling at the bottom. That's like my favorite part of Cheonggookjang. So every time my mom would make it, I would like scoop all the beans out. Then when I was like in high school, like early high school or something, I found out that my dad also likes that. And when I'm not there, he's the one who eats all the beans. Like my mom like let it slip one day.
[00:31:00.810] 它基本上就像豆汤，但发酵得更彻底，所以有点臭。我们家喜欢吃的是整粒的黄豆，让它们沉在汤底。那是我最喜欢清麵的部分。所以每次我妈做清麵的时候，我都会把黄豆都捞出来。后来我上高中，大概是初中那会儿，发现我爸也喜欢这样吃。我不在家的时候，都是他把黄豆都吃光。好像是我妈哪天不小心说漏嘴了。
[00:31:28.630] Like, oh, so funny that you and your dad both like to eat the Cheonggookjang beans. And I was like, what are you talking about? Like, I thought this was just my thing. And she was like, no, your dad also likes it. But after I found that out, I was like, okay, I should like share. So then we like half happened. But it was literally not until I was like 15 where I like realized he also liked it. Oh my God. That's how considerate he is of you. He's like, my child can have it.
[00:31:28.630] 比如，她说：“哦，真巧，你和你爸爸都喜欢吃清国酱豆。” 我当时就想，你在说什么？我还以为只有我才喜欢呢。然后她说：“不，你爸爸也喜欢吃。” 知道之后，我就想，好吧，那我也应该分享一下。于是，我们俩就慢慢开始一起吃了。但直到我15岁左右，我才意识到他也喜欢吃。我的天哪！他真是太体贴了。他会说：“我的孩子也可以吃。”
[00:31:57.990] I don't need it. That's so cute. I'm just imagining like young Jisoo scooping out a bunch of beans. And her dad looking at them a little sadly. But he's like, yeah, you should eat them. He's like, those were mine once. Well, I guess beans aside, I do want to ask you guys. Do you feel like your parents ever went through phases? Whether it was with like household dinner habits, watching TV with dinner, for example.
[00:31:57.990] 我不需要。这太可爱了。我脑海里浮现出小智秀舀出一把豆子的画面，她爸爸有点伤感地看着它们，但又说：“是啊，你应该吃掉它们。” 他说：“这些曾经是我的。” 好了，豆子先不说，我想问问大家，你们觉得父母的生活习惯有没有经历过一些变化？比如，像吃饭时看电视之类的。
[00:32:26.350] Or whether it was like actual food related stuff like a salad phase or a no white rice phase. Like, do you remember any phases like that? I did have a phase where we watched TV at the dinner table. My dad even set up a TV at the end of the dinner table. So they would watch a bunch of like Chinese shows and I would just get absorbed into it too. But then after a while, they were like, ah, forget it. They just like removed the TV. And we went back to normal dinners.
[00:32:26.350] 或者像某些饮食习惯，比如特别爱吃沙拉或者不吃白米饭之类的。你还记得自己有过类似的阶段吗？我曾经有一段时间，我们一家人会在餐桌上看电视。我爸甚至在餐桌尽头放了一台电视。他们会看很多中国电视剧之类的，我也跟着看得津津有味。但过了一段时间，他们就觉得算了，干脆把电视搬走了。然后我们就恢复了正常的晚餐。
[00:32:57.510] I'm trying to think about specific phases we had. So I can't think of phases with dishes necessarily. But there was a phase where we didn't have a microwave. Which is kind of funny. It was like an anti-microwave phase or something. I think what really happened was our microwave was really old. And then we just like didn't bother to replace it. So we would reheat everything in either like the convection oven or just over the stove.
[00:32:57.510] 我努力回想我们经历过的具体阶段。所以，我一时想不出跟餐具有关的具体阶段。但确实有一段时间我们家没有微波炉。这还挺搞笑的。感觉就像是进入了“反微波炉”阶段似的。我觉得真正的原因是我们的微波炉太旧了。然后我们就懒得换新的。所以我们只能用对流烤箱或者直接在炉灶上加热食物。
[00:33:26.950] Which was kind of wild. I distinctly remember trying to make hot chocolate. Heating my milk on the stove. Just like mixing it so a little like layer wouldn't form on top. So I think it was primarily because number one, our microwave was just too old. But also I feel like maybe my parents or specifically my mom read online that like microwaves aren't like good for your health. So there were like a couple years in our life that we just never had microwaved food.
[00:33:26.950] 那感觉真是有点不可思议。我清楚地记得当时想做热巧克力。我在炉子上加热牛奶，一边搅拌一边防止表面结皮。所以我觉得主要原因有二：一是我们家的微波炉太旧了；二是我觉得可能是我爸妈，特别是我妈，在网上看到过微波炉对健康不好之类的说法。所以有那么几年，我们家根本没吃过微波炉加热的食物。
[00:33:56.750] It was kind of wild. Damn. I feel like that would double the amount of dishes to do. Especially pots and pans which are annoying to clean. Totally. I could never. Dude. Yeah, that's crazy. I think our family also had like a TV phase. We would like watch a bunch of shows during dinner. And then I just remember one day I noticed like our little laptop that we use as like a fake TV at the end of the table wasn't there.
[00:33:56.750] 真是太疯狂了。天哪。我觉得那样的话要洗的碗碟数量会翻倍。尤其是锅碗瓢盆，洗起来特别麻烦。确实如此。我绝对做不到。哥们儿。是啊，太疯狂了。我觉得我们家也曾经有一段时间特别迷电视。我们会在吃饭的时候看很多电视节目。然后我记得有一天，我发现我们放在餐桌尽头，用来当“假电视”的小笔记本电脑不见了。
[00:34:25.350] And I was like, oh, how come we're not watching, you know, the Saturday show today? And my dad was like, yeah, like I read online that it's supposed to be better if you don't watch TV while you eat. So we're not going to do that anymore. And I was like devastated. I was like, no. No, we ate dinner and it just felt so empty without the TV because we had like our daily shows too that we like to watch. Literally the next week on that Saturday, the TV was back. Oh, thank God. It's like a short-lived phase. It's so funny.
[00:34:25.350] 我当时就想，哎，今天怎么没看周六的节目呢？我爸说，是啊，我在网上看到说吃饭的时候最好别看电视，所以我们以后不看了。我当时就崩溃了，心想，不行不行，我们吃完晚饭，感觉家里空荡荡的，因为我们平时也喜欢看一些日常节目。结果，下周六，电视就又开着了。谢天谢地，这只是个短暂的阶段，真是太搞笑了。
[00:34:55.210] Oh my God. Wait, my family also had this really funny phase. Dude, one summer, my brother and I found this game that our parents used to play. Some like online RPG game, kind of like World of Warcraft-esque. He got like the entire family to start playing it. And we all became like addicted to it. So then we would just order Taco Bell for our meals.
[00:34:55.210] 我的天哪。等等，我家也经历过一段特别搞笑的时期。哥们儿，有一年夏天，我和我哥发现了一款我爸妈以前玩的游戏。好像是个网络角色扮演游戏，有点像魔兽世界那种。他居然让全家人都开始玩。我们都上瘾了。所以，我们每天晚上都只点塔可钟外卖。
[00:35:24.330] Wait, we literally became like degenerates for a month. Okay. Actually, I don't know if it was as long as a month, but it was like definitely a week or two. Yeah. And it would be like, oh shit, it's meal time. And my dad would be like, I'm going to drive to the Taco Bell down the street and get a bunch of bean and cheese. Yeah, it was pretty crazy. That's amazing. I love that, honestly.
[00:35:24.330] 等等，我们真的整整一个月都过着放荡不羁的生活。好吧。其实，我不知道是不是真的有一个月，但肯定有一两个星期。对。然后就好像，哎呀，该吃饭了。我爸就会说，我要开车去街角的塔可钟，买一大堆豆子和奶酪。是啊，那段时间真是太疯狂了。太不可思议了。说真的，我喜欢这种感觉。
[00:35:46.430] But the funniest part is that my mom told me recently, she was like, your brother Max told me that those were like his favorite memories of our family of all time. And I was like, dude. That is so touching. You're like, you mean that period where we didn't talk to each other and didn't look at each other during meal? Wait, no, but we would play the game together. Like we would raid together and like boss run together.
[00:35:46.430] 但最搞笑的是，我妈最近跟我说，你弟弟Max跟我说，那些是我们家他最美好的回忆。我当时就想，老兄，这也太感人了吧。你是不是说，那段时间我们俩都不说话，吃饭的时候也不看对方？等等，不对，我们还会一起玩游戏。比如一起打副本，一起打boss。
[00:36:17.030] That's crazy. Yeah, I remember I was so shocked. I was like, damn, we're going to eat Taco Bell every day. And you guys love Taco Bell too? I love that. And I feel like you're like in a way carrying that torch, you know, with you. I feel like I could still see you doing that. For sure. Never turn down some Taco Bell.
[00:36:17.030] 太疯狂了。是啊，我记得当时我震惊极了。我就想，天哪，我们以后每天都要吃塔可钟了。你们也喜欢塔可钟？我太喜欢了。我觉得你好像在某种程度上继承了这份热爱，你知道吗？我觉得你现在还能继续这么做。当然了。永远不会拒绝塔可钟。
[00:36:41.850] This is kind of random, but did you guys grow up eating dinner at your dining table or did you eat it somewhere else in your house? I only ask because we had like a formal dining room with like, you know, the big wooden dining table. But we also had this little like bar area. It was like a kitchen island kind of thing. And then there were bar stools. And I guess because it was closer to the kitchen, we would always eat there.
[00:36:41.850] 这个问题有点突兀，但你们小时候是在餐桌上吃晚饭，还是在家里其他地方吃？我这么问是因为我们家有个正式的餐厅，里面有那种很大的木质餐桌。但我们家还有一个小小的吧台区，有点像厨房岛台，旁边放着吧台椅。我想可能是因为吧台离厨房比较近，所以我们总是在那里吃饭。
[00:37:08.170] And the only time we sat at the dining table was when people would come over. Later, I was like, isn't that kind of weird? Like, why did we buy this entire dining table? Only for it to be untouched most of the year. We actually had kind of a similar setup. So we had like the formal dining room and dining table that we would only ever use if people were coming over.
[00:37:08.170] 我们只有在有客人来的时候才会坐在餐桌旁。后来我想，这难道不奇怪吗？我们为什么要买这么大的餐桌？结果一年到头大部分时间都闲置着？其实我们家的情况也差不多。我们有个正式的餐厅和餐桌，但只有在有客人来的时候才会用。
[00:37:32.850] But on a regular basis, we had like this smaller dining table that was closer to the kitchen. And that's where we would, I guess it's technically still an official dining table, but we'd never use like the large nicer one. We just use like the day-to-day one that seats like only my family. No more than five people, truly. Dude, that's crazy. Same thing.
[00:37:32.850] 但平时，我们用的是那种离厨房比较近的小餐桌。严格来说，它应该也算是正式的餐桌，但我们从来不用那张又大又漂亮的餐桌。我们只用那张日常用的、只够我们一家人坐的餐桌。真的，最多也就五个人。老兄，这也太夸张了吧。一样的情况。
[00:37:57.570] Like, I also had the kitchen island bar area that we would always eat on. But I think my parents started to think similarly to you, Jisoo, where they were like, okay, wait, we literally have this bigger dining table outside. Like, why don't we just use it? So one day they cleaned it up, set the table. After that, we ate on the formal table. We still do now as well.
[00:37:57.570] 比如，我家厨房的吧台区域以前也是我们经常吃饭的地方。但我觉得我爸妈后来的想法跟你差不多，Jisoo，他们就想，等等，我们明明在外面还有一张更大的餐桌。为什么不用呢？于是有一天，他们把餐桌收拾干净，摆好。从那以后，我们就在正式的餐桌上吃饭了。现在也一样。
[00:38:25.330] So for us, I'm realizing now that we also used to eat on the coffee table a lot. And I don't know if this is a Korean thing or something, but when I would go back to Korea to visit my family, and we all like met up at my grandma's house to eat, we would set up this like a lower Korean table called a sang. And then we would all just sit like crisscross applesauce around the little sang and just eat on the ground. I carry that habit with me to this day.
[00:38:25.330] 所以，我现在才意识到，我们以前也经常在茶几上吃饭。我不知道这算不算韩国人的习惯，但每次我回韩国探亲，大家都会聚在我奶奶家吃饭，我们会摆上一张叫做“桌”（sang）的韩式矮桌。然后大家就盘腿围坐在桌旁，直接在地上吃饭。直到今天，我还是保留着这个习惯。
[00:38:52.010] I still like to eat at my coffee table and like sit crisscross applesauce. And it's just like comforting to me. But I realized that if maybe if you didn't grow up doing it, it's really uncomfortable because James will start to have like knee problems or like knee pain or something. So now when we do that, he takes like our little stool and like sits on it. Kind of like hunched over that I'm just like happily sitting crisscross applesauce on the ground.
[00:38:52.010] 我仍然喜欢坐在咖啡桌旁吃饭，盘腿而坐。这让我感觉很舒服。但我意识到，如果你从小没养成这种习惯，詹姆斯可能会觉得很不舒服，比如膝盖疼什么的。所以现在我们一起吃饭的时候，他会搬个小凳子坐在上面，有点弓着背，而我则开心地盘腿坐在地上。
[00:39:19.870] Wait, so you guys don't eat at your dining table? I would say it's like 50-50. How about you, Sunny? Like do you eat at a dining table nowadays or at like the coffee table or a bar or whatever? I'm 50-50 kind of like Jisoo. I feel like if the meal is a little more involved and could be messy, then I think we'll eat at the dining table.
[00:39:19.870] 等等，所以你们都不在餐桌上吃饭吗？我觉得大概一半一半吧。Sunny，你呢？你现在是在餐桌上吃饭，还是在咖啡桌、吧台之类的地方吃？我和Jisoo差不多，一半一半吧。我觉得如果饭菜比较复杂，可能会弄得比较狼狈，那我们就会选择在餐桌上吃。
[00:39:44.290] But if there's like a show we're trying to watch or like a game or anything, we'll usually eat at the coffee table. And it's really funny. I will sit on the ground because I just like want my table to be at this level. Like I don't want to sit on the sofa and then bend over to eat. Right. But Jim will sit on the sofa and bend over to eat while I'm sitting on the ground. So I have a similar setup to like Jisoo and James. He's like hunched over. Yes, literally.
[00:39:44.290] 但如果我们想看剧、玩游戏什么的，通常会在茶几上吃饭。这真的很有趣。我会坐在地上，因为我喜欢桌子的高度。我不想坐在沙发上然后弯腰吃饭。对吧。但Jim会坐在沙发上弯腰吃饭，而我坐在地上。所以我的坐姿和Jisoo还有James差不多。他总是弓着背。是的，真的。
[00:40:14.050] We both have back problems, but different kinds. Different parts of the back probably. Oh my god. Okay, I'm similar. I love eating at the coffee table, especially if it's just me. Then I can like watch TV or have something in the background. But I do have like a more formal dinner table. And yeah, if it's like more elevated or there's like more pieces to the dinner, I guess, then I'll set it up on that. But dude, so this was a problem for me too.
[00:40:14.050] 我们俩都有背痛，但类型不一样。可能背痛的部位也不一样。我的天哪。好吧，我的情况也差不多。我喜欢在茶几上吃饭，尤其是一个人的时候。那样我就可以一边看电视一边听点什么。不过我也有张比较正式的餐桌。嗯，如果餐桌比较高，或者餐具比较多的话，我就会在那张桌子上吃饭。但是兄弟，这对我来说也是个问题。
[00:40:44.130] I was like, shoot, if I eat on the coffee table, then I have to like I usually end up sitting on the ground. And I was thinking like, that's such a waste of my couch. So what I did was I changed out my coffee table for one of those with a lift top. So now I can sit on the couch and eat on the coffee table and lift it up. Honestly, genius.
[00:40:44.130] 我当时就想，糟了，如果我在茶几上吃饭，那我通常最后都得坐在地上。我就想，这样太浪费我的沙发了。所以我就把茶几换成了那种可以升降桌面的。这样我就可以坐在沙发上，在茶几上吃饭，然后把桌面升起来。说真的，这主意太棒了。
[00:41:08.530] The one that I got, not only can it lift up, once it lifts up, you can actually extend it. It's like it's already folded over so you can unfold it into a bigger like surface area. So if I had a more complex dinner, I could set it up on the like maximum extension. Dude, you're like making spring rolls on your coffee table. But it's truly been a game changer.
[00:41:08.530] 我买的这款，不仅可以抬起来，抬起来之后还能展开。它就像是预先折叠好的，可以展开成更大的台面。所以如果我要准备比较复杂的晚餐，就可以把它展开到最大尺寸来摆放。哥们儿，你就像在咖啡桌上包春卷一样。它真的彻底改变了我的生活。
[00:41:35.230] But I think my ideal is like if I just had an island with bar seating, I think that's my ideal day to day seating probably. Dude, something about the dining table feels so formal. Like I feel like I should tuck a napkin into my collar or something. Do you think, okay, actually, are your dining tables round or like rectangles? Ours is rectangular. Oh, currently mine is rectangular.
[00:41:35.230] 但我觉得我理想的餐桌布局是这样的：有个岛台，配上吧台座位，那大概就是我日常用餐的理想方式了。老兄，餐桌总给人一种太正式的感觉。感觉好像我应该把餐巾塞进领子里似的。对了，你们的餐桌是圆的还是长方形的？我们家的是长方形的。哦，我现在的餐桌是长方形的。
[00:42:00.970] Okay, I have a theory that rectangular dining tables feel more formal than circular ones. Okay, but I have a question. Are you, are you, if it's just two people, are you sitting next to each other or across? Oh. On your rectangular table. We sit next to each other because we watch a show. Okay, we do that too. It's like iPad up. To optimize for screen viewing. Wait, I sit across. Whoa. Wow.
[00:42:00.970] 好吧，我有个理论，长方形餐桌比圆形餐桌更正式。好吧，但我有个问题。如果只有两个人，你们是并排坐还是面对面坐？哦。你们的餐桌是长方形的。我们并排坐，因为我们要一起看电视。好吧，我们也是。就像把iPad竖起来一样。这样看屏幕更舒服。等等，我是面对面坐的。哇哦。哇。
[00:42:30.050] You know, now that I think about it, sitting next to each other could be a move. Absolutely the move. I guess like we just defaulted to sitting across. Yeah, now that I'm picturing it in my head and like looking at the layout of the room, I'm like, oh, we could totally sit next to each other and watch the TV. It feels almost like the safe space to eat a meal sitting next to each other.
[00:42:30.050] 你知道吗，现在想想，并排坐着或许是个好主意。绝对是个好主意。我猜我们之前一直习惯对面坐着。是啊，现在我脑海里浮现出那个画面，再看看房间的布局，我就觉得，哦，我们完全可以并排坐着看电视。感觉并排坐着吃饭就像是一个更安全舒适的空间。
[00:42:58.830] Because that's something that I rarely do when we go out, if not never. But at home, it just feels so right. Like side by side and a TV across from us. The TV has to be there. Otherwise, it doesn't feel safe. It's the third person in the meal. Yes. Okay, but when I sit on my couch and use the coffee table, we're sitting next to each other. So funny.
[00:42:58.830] 因为我们外出时，我很少这样做，甚至可以说从来不这样做。但在家，这种感觉就特别合适。就像并排坐着，对面放着电视。电视必须在那里。不然，感觉就不安全。它就像吃饭时的第三个人。是的。好吧，但当我坐在沙发上，用茶几的时候，我们其实是并排坐着的。真有意思。
[00:43:24.870] I feel like by the end of this episode, the three of us are all going to have that same lift top extendable coffee table. Guys, I'm telling you, it's so good. I feel like I would never leave. It is a little dangerous. So we talked a bit about like the type of food that we've eaten at home growing up from our parents. So I'm wondering how that's carried on in our lives now. At home, what do you usually cook for yourself?
[00:43:24.870] 我觉得这集结束的时候，我们三个都会想要同一款升降伸缩咖啡桌。哥们儿，我跟你们说，它真的太好用了。感觉我都不想换了。有点危险。所以我们聊了聊小时候在家吃的父母做的饭菜。我想知道这些饮食习惯现在是怎么延续到我们生活中的。你们在家通常都给自己做什么饭呢？
[00:43:52.510] Or what do you feel comfortable eating in your day to day? For me, it's kind of funny because I think a lot of people ask me if I cook Korean food all the time at home. And I think when I first started out cooking at home, I would because that was kind of what I grew up eating. That's what the definition of dinner or like what the visual of dinner looks like to me. So then I would try to make those things at home.
[00:43:52.510] 或者说，你平时都吃些什么比较自在呢？对我来说，这还挺有意思的，因为很多人问我是不是经常在家做韩餐。我觉得我刚开始在家做饭的时候确实会做，因为我从小吃的就是韩餐。对我来说，晚餐的定义或者说晚餐的画面就是韩餐。所以那时候我就会尽量在家做这些菜。
[00:44:16.570] But I think just with my lifestyle and, you know, me not being like a first generation Korean person like my parents are, I was like, I feel like this is too much for me. I can't be cooking stew every single night and like making five panchans every day. So now we've been eating a lot of like salad or like, you know, the classic of like salmon, chicken breast, steamed broccoli or whatever. Korean food or Chinese food would be like a treat from time to time.
[00:44:16.570] 但我觉得主要是因为我的生活方式，而且我不是像我父母那样的第一代韩裔移民，所以我感觉这对我来说有点吃不消。我不可能每天晚上都炖菜，每天还要做五道小菜。所以现在我们经常吃沙拉，或者一些经典的菜肴，比如三文鱼、鸡胸肉、蒸西兰花之类的。韩餐或中餐就偶尔吃一次，算是犒劳自己。
[00:44:46.050] But I have like so many dried anchovies and kombu in my fridge because every time my mom goes to Korea, she comes back with like the good shit. You know, like the stuff that they stock in the supermarkets here, she says aren't as good as what you can get on like the dry markets or whatever in Korea. So she like vastly overestimates how much stew I make. And the entire bottom section of our fridge is just like anchovies. Oh my God.
[00:44:46.050] 但我冰箱里堆满了干凤尾鱼和昆布，因为我妈每次去韩国都会带回一些好东西。你知道，她说超市里卖的那些东西，不如韩国干货市场之类的地方卖的好。所以她总是高估我炖菜的量。我们冰箱最下面一层全是凤尾鱼。我的天哪。
[00:45:16.810] Dude, you should start selling them. Dude, you guys want to shop my stash? Low key yes. I'm down too. How about you, Sunny? I would say we also like optimize for just efficiency. So we're usually cooking like a protein, either like chicken, fish, sometimes red meat, and then like a veggie of sorts and eating it with rice.
[00:45:16.810] 哥们，你应该开始卖这些东西了。哥们，你们想来买我的存货吗？说实话，我挺想的。我也想。桑尼，你呢？我觉得我们也喜欢追求效率最大化。所以我们通常会做一份蛋白质，比如鸡肉、鱼肉，有时候也做红肉，再配点蔬菜，然后拌米饭吃。
[00:45:46.770] We will also sometimes eat like a pasta or like noodles and whatnot. But I think it's too involved and I'm not as good of a cook as my mom is. So there's no way I'm making like three Chinese dishes for a dinner casually.
[00:45:46.770] 我们偶尔也会吃点意大利面或者面条之类的。但我认为太麻烦了，而且我的厨艺不如我妈妈。所以我不可能随便做三道中式菜肴当晚餐。
[00:46:04.710] I think that is one thing that I would like to continue to learn more of is just Chinese cooking or like things that my mom's made so that I'm able to make that instead of just making chicken and broccoli or salmon and asparagus. Yeah, I think similar. I've been in a salad phase because it's just so easy. I literally go to Costco, bulk buy like lettuce, tomatoes, and then just, you know, eat that for the whole week.
[00:46:04.710] 我觉得我最想继续学习的就是中餐或者我妈妈做的那些菜，这样我就能自己做了，而不是只会做鸡肉西兰花或者三文鱼芦笋。嗯，我也这么觉得。我最近迷上了沙拉，因为它太方便了。我经常去Costco，买很多生菜、西红柿之类的，然后就吃这些，够吃一整周。
[00:46:33.170] You don't have to think too hard about it. And it's like nutritional, add a protein in there. So that's been like the easy go-to. And then sometimes what I'll do is in the morning or maybe like around noon, just like throw some protein into the Instant Pot or like I just got a slow cooker, which will make this even easier now. Just like toss it in in the morning, set it, and then like let it cook while I'm at work. Then when I come back, a soup is ready. Oh, I love that.
[00:46:33.170] 你不用想太多。而且营养方面也很简单，加点蛋白质就行了。所以这成了我的首选。有时候我会在早上或者中午左右，把一些蛋白质放进电压力锅里，或者像我最近刚买的慢炖锅，现在就更方便了。早上把食材放进去，设定好时间，然后就可以让它在我上班的时候慢慢炖。等我回来，汤就做好了。哦，我太喜欢了。
[00:47:03.130] I think I have a bit of a food identity crisis though because most of the stuff I make is like leaning towards Asian-ish. But at the same time, I'm like, I just do this because I'm Asian, I guess. And I'm used to eating this food, but it's not really like I had recipes passed down to me. I'm like Googling the same things that everyone else is. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like my mom can cook and she's pretty good at it, but she doesn't like cooking. So it's like some people are really into it.
[00:47:03.130] 我觉得我有点儿饮食身份认同危机，因为我做的菜大部分都偏亚洲风味。但同时我又觉得，我做这些大概是因为我是亚洲人吧。我习惯吃这些菜，但其实并没有人教我菜谱。我跟其他人一样，都是在网上搜同样的菜谱。你懂我的意思吗？嗯。我妈会做饭，而且做得很好，但她不喜欢做饭。所以感觉有些人真的很热爱做饭。
[00:47:33.010] So they're excited to like share recipes and like teach you more about it. But because it's not like my parents' favorite thing to do, I feel like the learnings that I got from them is maybe not as in-depth as like some other people could be getting from their parents. So in the end, it's just me like researching what to make.
[00:47:33.010] 所以他们很乐意分享食谱，教我更多相关知识。但因为这并不是我父母最喜欢做的事情，我觉得我从他们那里学到的东西可能不如其他人从父母那里学到的那么深入。所以最终，我还是得自己研究该做什么菜。
[00:47:54.270] And then I'm like, oh, well, I guess I've chosen to research a lot of Asian recipes when I could have also just researched a lot of other like whatever anything recipes. And it's it also makes me wonder like, you know, if I were to have kids, what would I feed them? Like, what are they going to be eating? What is my like what am I passing down to them? Actually, I think that's a really, really good point.
[00:47:54.270] 然后我就想，哎，我好像选择了研究那么多亚洲菜谱，其实我本来也可以研究其他任何菜谱的。这也让我开始思考，如果我有了孩子，我会给他们吃什么？他们会吃什么？我会把什么传承给他们？其实，我觉得这确实是个非常好的问题。
[00:48:18.510] And I feel a little bit of that imposter syndrome sometimes, too, where I'll be like halfway through making a meal and I'm like, wait, am I making Asian fusion? Like, am I elephant bar right now? Yeah. Because the other day I was like, I want to eat a salad and like be healthy, but I want it to be like vaguely reminiscent of like Japanese cuisine. So that I made like miso salmon on salad with like sesame dressing or something.
[00:48:18.510] 有时候我也会有点那种冒名顶替综合症的感觉，比如做菜做到一半，突然会想，等等，我这是在做亚洲融合菜吗？我这是在做Elephant Bar吗？对啊。因为前几天我想吃沙拉，想吃得健康一点，但又想让它有点像日式料理。所以我就做了味噌三文鱼沙拉，配上芝麻酱之类的。
[00:48:46.990] And then I was eating it and I was like, well, this isn't like really Japanese food. Like some weird mix that I just like threw together. Yeah, I feel like I am similar in that I feel like I want to make certain dishes, but I don't know how.
[00:48:46.990] 然后我一边吃一边想，嗯，这根本不像正宗的日本料理。感觉像是随便混在一起的某种奇怪食材。是啊，我觉得我的情况也差不多，想做一些菜，但不知道怎么做。
[00:49:03.110] So I think like also with the rise of social media, I've been using that a lot to learn new recipes or like Asian inspired dishes or maybe just I think like there's a lot of Asian American creators now who specialize in like at home cooking. Or maybe have had like previous restaurant experience.
[00:49:03.110] 所以我觉得，随着社交媒体的兴起，我经常利用它来学习新的食谱，比如亚洲风味的菜肴，或者我觉得现在有很多亚裔美国创作者专注于家常菜，或者他们之前可能有过餐厅工作经验。
[00:49:23.590] And I feel like I follow a lot of them just to get like new recipe inspiration and try to like expand my repertoire from like five to ten dishes without having the exact like skills that immigrant parents have. Honestly, sometimes I ask my mom, I'm like, yo, can you look up this dish for me in like Chinese and then send over the Chinese recipe or like I'll like look at it with her, the Chinese recipe.
[00:49:23.590] 我觉得我关注很多人就是为了寻找新的菜谱灵感，想把我的菜谱从五道扩展到十道，但我并没有移民父母那样精湛的厨艺。说实话，有时候我会问我妈，我说：“喂，你能帮我查一下这道菜的中文食谱吗？然后把中文食谱发给我，或者我们可以一起看看。”
[00:49:52.370] And I'm like, OK, what does that say? Like, what does this say? And I'm writing it down. I'm like, OK, maybe I'll try this later. I like I don't know what it is, but like sometimes that feels almost more legit in a way. It's like, oh, I'm like looking at people's like from wherever and all the histories of their families versus just like whatever I'm piecing together from like random other recipes, if that makes sense.
[00:49:52.370] 然后我就想，好吧，这上面写了什么？这个上面写了什么？然后我就记下来。我想，好吧，也许我以后可以试试这个。我也不知道为什么，但有时候这样感觉反而更靠谱。就像，哦，我是在研究来自不同地方的人们的食谱，了解他们家族的历史，而不是像现在这样，只是从一些随机的食谱里拼凑出来的东西，不知道你能不能理解我的意思。
[00:50:18.210] Yeah, that reminds me of this time where I was also very in like, I want to make something how my mom used to make it. I like texted my mom and I was like, oh, mom, like, can you send me your recipe on how you make this one Korean dish? And then she was like, oh, just go to like 10,000recipes.com and like type it in. And that's what I use. And I was like, wait, that's the website I've been using. Like you're telling me we're sourcing from the same website. Oh, my God.
[00:50:18.210] 对啊，这让我想起之前我也特别想学我妈以前做的菜。我就给我妈发短信，说：“妈，你能把你做的那道韩国菜的食谱发给我吗？” 她回复说：“哦，去10000recipes.com网站搜一下就行了。” 她说：“我就是用的这个网站。” 我当时就想：“等等，这不就是我一直用的网站吗？你是说我们用的都是同一个网站？我的天哪！”
[00:50:47.550] Maybe it's all a lie. I should be like my parents are also using the same recipes too. Like all of our parents have the same shared cookbook. Yeah, exactly. Like family recipe. It's from user like XAG1234. Well, I guess as all of us start to assemble our little food repertoire of dishes that we'll pass down.
[00:50:47.550] 也许这一切都是谎言。我应该说，我的父母也用着同样的食谱。就像我们所有人的父母都共用一本食谱一样。没错，就是这样。就像家传食谱。它来自像 XAG1234 这样的用户。好吧，我想，随着我们逐渐积累起各自的菜肴，并将它们传承下去，情况就是这样。
