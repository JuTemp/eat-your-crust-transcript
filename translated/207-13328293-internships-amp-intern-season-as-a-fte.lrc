[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Tanea.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Tanea。
[00:00:15.040] Welcome back, Tanea. For a lot of our longtime listeners, you might recognize Tanea. She has been on the podcast a few times. The last episode that Tanea was on the pod with us was episode number 118, Visiting the Motherland, where we talked about going back to our parents' cities that they grew up in. Very heartwarming episode.
[00:00:15.040] 欢迎回来，塔妮娅。很多老听众可能都认识塔妮娅，她之前来过我们播客几次。塔妮娅上次做客是第118期节目，主题是“探访故土”，我们在那期节目里聊了聊回到父母成长的城市。那期节目非常温馨感人。
[00:00:38.520] So check it out if you haven't already. Before we get to this week's topic, I have a slang word for us. I'm slightly hesitant to call it completely Gen Z just because I feel like it's a slang word that a lot of millennials have easily adopted. In fact, it might have come from millennials. I'm not super sure. But either way, it's one of those like blurred lines ones where both Gen Z and millennials are in the past.
[00:00:38.520] 所以，如果你还没看过的话，赶紧去看看。在进入本周话题之前，我想先跟大家分享一个俚语。我不太想把它完全归为Z世代的专属词汇，因为我觉得很多千禧一代也很容易接受它。事实上，它甚至可能就是千禧一代创造出来的。我不太确定。但无论如何，它属于那种界限模糊的词汇，Z世代和千禧一代都算是过去式了。
[00:01:08.520] And I also use this slang word. So the word is cringe. And it's pretty self-explanatory. You know, like if something makes you cringe, then that is cringe.
[00:01:08.520] 我还用了一个俚语，就是“cringe”。这个词的意思很明显，就是如果某件事让你觉得尴尬，那就是“cringe”。
[00:01:22.000] The first instance that I can remember hearing this word is Reddit. So Reddit, there was a pretty big subreddit called r slash cringe, if I remember correctly. And then there would be a lot of videos on it. And I feel like that used to be the way that millennials would use the word cringe. So it kind of is like, what is a very awkward video or something that makes you physically cringe?
[00:01:22.000] 我第一次听到“cringe”这个词是在Reddit上。我记得当时Reddit上有个挺大的子版块叫r/cringe，里面有很多相关的视频。我觉得千禧一代以前就是这么用“cringe”这个词的。它的意思大概是：有什么特别尴尬的视频，或者什么东西会让你觉得浑身不自在？
[00:01:46.860] But I do think the way Gen Z uses it has a little bit of separation. I think for millennials, things that qualify as cringe are really specific in nature. But I think for Gen Z, they use the term a lot. And sometimes I'm like, I feel like that's not even that cringe. And they're like, yo, that's cringe. Yo, that's cringe. I'm like, damn, this is how I know I'm old because I can't relate to how they use this word.
[00:01:46.860] 但我确实觉得Z世代使用这个词的方式有点不一样。我觉得对千禧一代来说，真正让人尴尬的事情往往很具体。但Z世代用这个词的频率很高。有时候我觉得，这根本就没那么尴尬。但他们却会说，哇，这太尴尬了。哇，这太尴尬了。我就想，天哪，这就是我老了的标志，因为我完全无法理解他们用这个词的方式。
[00:02:09.280] Okay, actually, that's true. They do use cringe from what I've noticed as well, very like loosely, they just throw it out there. And sometimes you're like, was that really cringe? Yeah. The way that I have used it is mostly like, if my friends send me a video, I'm just like, I'm cringing so hard right now just watching that video and like more around like secondhand embarrassment. Right. I guess that's just how I use it.
[00:02:09.280] 好吧，确实如此。我注意到他们也确实会用“cringe”这个词，而且用得挺随意的，随便就用。有时候你会想，这真的那么尴尬吗？是啊。我用这个词的方式主要是，如果朋友给我发个视频，我就会说，我现在看着这个视频都尴尬得不行，感觉像是感同身受的尴尬。对。我想这就是我用这个词的方式吧。
[00:02:36.160] I know for a while there was like this TikTok trend that was basically just do the most embarrassing stuff until you yourself can't hold it in anymore and you like cringe.
[00:02:36.160] 我知道之前TikTok上流行过一种潮流，基本上就是做各种最尴尬的事情，直到自己再也忍不住，然后尴尬得不行。
[00:02:48.160] But I think that was mostly the slightly older side of TikTok, like millennial people. And what I've seen younger like Gen Z people use cringe. One way that I've seen it is actually in like gaming. If someone's like being a try hard and they're like, you know, using all these strategies or doing these like kind of tricky things, then people will be like, oh, that's hella cringe. That's so sad.
[00:02:48.160] 但我认为这主要是TikTok上年龄稍大一些的用户，比如千禧一代。而我看到更年轻的Z世代用户则更倾向于用“cringe”这个词。我看到的一个例子是游戏。如果有人很努力地想赢，用各种策略或者做一些花里胡哨的事情，人们就会觉得，哦，这也太尴尬了吧。真让人难过。
[00:03:18.320] But being smarter, you're cringy. I think it's like their way of making themselves feel less bad that they're like losing and getting outsmarted. So they're like, oh my God, that's like they're using it kind of ironically, like, oh my God, that's so cringe that they're like trying so hard. It's just a game, you know?
[00:03:18.320] 但装聪明反而让人觉得尴尬。我觉得他们这是在用这种方式来安慰自己，免得输了、被人耍得团团转。所以他们会想，天哪，他们这是在讽刺地用这种方式，好像在说，天哪，他们这么努力装聪明真是太尴尬了。这只是个游戏而已，懂吗？
[00:03:38.680] Yeah, I almost feel like the way that Gen Z uses it now is to describe something that's just uncool. If it's not cool, then it's cringe. And sometimes I feel like it comes up in a funny context to like when I hang out with my more Gen Z vibe imbued friends, I guess, they'll say something and then they'll be like, oh, sorry, that was like super cringe. I don't even know why I said that.
[00:03:38.680] 是啊，我觉得Z世代现在用这个词几乎就是用来形容一些很土的东西。如果某件事不酷，那就是尴尬。有时候我觉得这个词用在挺搞笑的语境里，比如我和那些比较有Z世代气质的朋友一起玩的时候，他们会说一些话，然后又会说，哦，不好意思，刚才那句话太尴尬了。我也不知道我当时为什么会说那样的话。
[00:04:00.700] And I'm like, oh my God, like you don't have to call yourself cringe. The way I understand cringe is like you see a picture of you in like the 3D glasses from seventh grade. That's like cringe, you know? Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely I think for millennials, like more self embarrassment, or again, like that concept of embarrassment rather than just the uncool part that you were mentioning. Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. Like if it's not cool, it's cringe. I'm just boring. So I'm cringe, I guess.
[00:04:00.700] 我当时就想，我的天哪，你没必要说自己很尴尬吧。我理解的尴尬就像你看到自己戴着七年级那种3D眼镜的照片一样。那才叫尴尬，你知道吗？对。我觉得对千禧一代来说，更多的是自我羞耻，或者说，是那种尴尬的感觉，而不是你刚才提到的不酷。嗯，这么说很贴切。如果不够酷，那就是尴尬。我就是个无聊的人。所以，我想我就是个尴尬的人吧。
[00:04:31.240] All right, well, cringe things aside, let's kind of jump into the topic today, which is internships. So today we really wanted to talk about the whole concept of intern season because we're kind of in that full throttle right now, as well as what it's like to be in your first internship and even talking a little bit about the
[00:04:31.240] 好了，先不说那些尴尬的事，咱们直接进入今天的主题——实习。今天我们想聊聊实习季的概念，因为我们现在正处于实习旺季，还要聊聊第一次实习的感受，甚至还会稍微谈谈……
[00:04:51.360] conversion process in the future as well. So let's kind of kick this off by talking about intern season. What are both of your understandings of this term and how true do you think the concept is? What I think intern season is? Maybe this is just because what I've experienced, but intern season has always made the campus super lively and also really young and kind of naive in a sense.
[00:04:51.360] 未来也会有类似的转变过程。所以我们先来聊聊实习生季吧。你们俩对这个词的理解是什么？你们觉得这个概念有多贴切？我个人对实习生季的理解是？也许这只是我个人的经历，但实习生季总是让校园变得格外热闹，也让校园里充满了年轻人的活力，某种程度上来说，甚至有点天真。
[00:05:20.420] Because when I was back in Seattle in 2021 summer, and it was intern season, everything was just happier. And like when you get on the bus, everyone's like chit chatting.
[00:05:20.420] 因为2021年夏天我回到西雅图的时候，正值实习生旺季，一切都更快乐。就像你上公交车的时候，大家都在闲聊。
[00:05:30.620] And it's just like, again, that like young vibe being brought into a company. So that I don't know what I personally thought of intern season before. This is just like my experience of it. So I guess it just holds true. But yeah, definitely like livelier, younger, chattier around those words.
[00:05:30.620] 感觉就像，又一次，公司里注入了年轻活力。所以，我之前对实习生季的印象不太好，这只是我个人的亲身经历。我觉得这种感觉确实存在。总之，实习生们更活泼、更年轻、更健谈。
[00:05:50.440] I guess I can agree mostly, because Tanaya and I both work at tech companies. So like, intern season is pretty real. In the summer, there's definitely huge hordes of interns coming onto campus and stuff.
[00:05:50.440] 我基本同意你的说法，因为我和塔娜娅都在科技公司工作。所以，实习生旺季确实存在。夏天的时候，肯定会有大量的实习生涌入校园。
[00:06:04.860] I personally don't deal with a ton of interns in my current work. But I can see that there's like, more of these young people walking around. And because of that, sometimes there's also more, like events, happy hours or get togethers or, you know, activities that are happening on the grass outside in the courtyard or whatever.
[00:06:04.860] 我个人目前的工作中接触的实习生并不多。但我注意到，街上确实多了很多年轻人。正因为如此，有时也会有更多活动，比如欢乐时光、聚会，或者其他在庭院草坪上举行的各种活动。
[00:06:25.780] And I guess that kind of adds into the whole, like lively vibe. I guess it's because you're trying to show these interns that, oh, this is like such a fun place to work, right? Don't you want to apply here for full time positions?
[00:06:25.780] 我想这也有助于营造一种活跃的氛围。我想是因为你想让这些实习生们觉得，哦，这里真是个很有趣的工作场所，对吧？难道你们不想申请这里的全职职位吗？
[00:06:39.460] That is interesting. So I don't work at a tech company. And actually, recently, we kind of did start having interns. But I think it's not enough of them for it to be like a season at our company. I am curious, since both of you guys have had internship experience. So when you yourselves were interns, did you feel like you were able to recognize the concept of intern season? Or is that concept really only a thing once you're like a full time employee?
[00:06:39.460] 这很有意思。我不在科技公司工作。其实，最近我们公司也开始招实习生了。但我觉得实习生人数还不够多，不足以形成我们公司的“实习旺季”。我很好奇，因为你们俩都有实习经历。你们当实习生的时候，有没有意识到“实习旺季”这个概念？还是说只有正式员工之后，这种概念才会出现？
[00:07:08.780] I think it really is when you're a full time employee, at least for me, because I had no concept of what it was to be a full time. I was just like, oh, it's just like this every day. And the office, like I didn't see that necessarily shift. But I will say that's, I think it's because I work in a tech company where I'm seeing this, like, again, influx of a lot of interns. I used to intern at a private equity firm back in San Diego.
[00:07:08.780] 我觉得当你成为全职员工之后，情况确实会有所不同，至少对我来说是这样，因为我以前完全没有全职工作的概念。我当时就觉得，哦，每天都这样。而且办公室里，我感觉也没有什么变化。但我想，这可能是因为我在一家科技公司工作，而这家公司又涌入了大量的实习生。我以前在圣地亚哥一家私募股权公司实习过。
[00:07:36.800] And the intern season was like, five of us. And everyone in that private equity firm was like, super quiet, like there was no like events. And again, it was like a smaller company. So maybe that was it. But it was very like, calm. And like, again, we didn't have any events. The interns weren't like best friends going to happy hour all the time. Like it wasn't a really like big event. It was just like, okay, like come into work clock out.
[00:07:36.800] 实习生那会儿，我们五个人就来了。那家私募股权公司里的人都特别安静，好像没什么活动似的。而且，那家公司规模也比较小。也许这就是原因吧。总之，气氛很平静。实习生们之间不像好朋友那样经常一起去酒吧喝下午茶。也没有什么特别热闹的活动。就是，正常上班，打卡下班。
[00:08:02.680] So I guess it also depends on your industry. But going back to your question, I think I felt it more as full time rather than being an intern, because you're just in a bubble. I feel like when you're an intern, you don't know anything else. Yeah, I agree. Like intern, you don't know the comparison to what normal is. So you're just like, oh, wow, this is what work is like all the time. Yeah, like free swag and events all the time. Sign me up.
[00:08:02.680] 所以我觉得这也取决于你所在的行业。但回到你的问题，我觉得全职工作比实习生更有感觉，因为你就像生活在一个封闭的小世界里。我觉得实习生的时候，你对其他情况一无所知。是的，我同意。就像实习生一样，你不知道正常工作是什么样的。所以你会觉得，哇，原来工作一直都是这样啊。是啊，到处都是免费赠品和活动。我也想加入。
[00:08:31.180] I know one of the big things that Bay Area companies like to do sometimes is take their interns out to like a baseball game, because usually it's like not terribly expensive. And it's a good way to get a large group out. So that's not really happening in our regular day to day. I don't think I've ever attended a baseball game because of work after being full time.
[00:08:31.180] 我知道湾区的一些公司喜欢带实习生去看棒球比赛，因为通常来说费用不算太高。而且这也是个让一大群人聚在一起的好方法。不过，在我们日常工作中，这种情况并不常见。自从全职工作后，我好像就再也没因为工作原因去看过棒球比赛了。
[00:08:54.760] Same. And I remember like, in Seattle, there's a really beautiful lake right near the office. And so they took us out on a boat. And it was like this huge thing. But literally, I've worked at my current company for four years. And I have not even gotten like a single t shirt. I got so much free swag when I was an intern. Like the difference is crazy.
[00:08:54.760] 没错。我记得在西雅图的时候，办公室附近有个特别漂亮的湖。他们带我们乘船出去玩。那感觉就像一艘巨大的船。但说真的，我在现在这家公司工作四年了，连一件T恤都没拿到过。我实习的时候可是拿到了好多免费赠品。这差别也太大了。
[00:09:15.340] Oh, my gosh. Well, I'm very curious, because I kind of want to walk through, I guess, all aspects of working in both an internship and as a full time employee and see where the big differences are. And I guess we can kind of start off with the interviewing process. So how different do you think the interview process is for someone who wants to be an intern versus someone applying for a full time role?
[00:09:15.340] 我的天哪。嗯，我很好奇，因为我想了解一下实习生和正式员工工作的方方面面，看看它们之间最大的区别是什么。我想我们可以先从面试流程开始。你觉得对于想成为实习生的人来说，面试流程和申请正式员工的人相比，有什么不同呢？
[00:09:39.440] Obviously, I think it's a lot less rigorous. Because when you are interviewing someone for an internship, they don't have a lot of experience. And working as a full time employee, when I am interviewing an intern, and I would like if I were I haven't interviewed an intern. But if I were like, hearing like, oh, they did this at this company and this elaborate project, I think you know that they're exaggerating a little and like,
[00:09:39.440] 显然，我认为这种方式的严谨性要低得多。因为面试实习生时，他们经验不足。而作为一名全职员工，当我面试实习生时——我当然希望自己没有面试过实习生——如果我听到他们说，哦，他们在某公司做了这个，做了这个复杂的项目，我想你就会知道他们有点夸大其词了。
[00:10:07.200] they might not have done, you know, they might not have done, you know, a crazy huge project, because you only have three months and half the time you're ramping up. So I think with that in mind, you are definitely grilled harder for a full time position than an internship. That's just my thoughts. Because I didn't re interview. So I honestly don't have a lot of credible sources on this.
[00:10:07.200] 他们可能没做过那种规模庞大的项目，因为你只有三个月的时间，而且其中一半时间都在适应阶段。所以我觉得考虑到这一点，全职职位肯定比实习职位要求更严格。这只是我的想法，因为我没有参加复试，所以说实话，我在这方面并没有太多可靠的信息来源。
[00:10:31.540] I think I think I do agree that the internship interviews feel less high stakes, especially like looking back on it now. Because you're like, okay, realistically, this person, this company is about to hire you for like, three months to potentially do like bitch work for them.
[00:10:31.540] 我觉得我同意实习面试确实没那么紧张，尤其是现在回想起来。因为你会想，好吧，现实点说，这个人，这家公司，要雇你三个月，可能就让你干些杂活。
[00:10:52.120] They're probably putting up a very professional front. Like, yes, yes, this is a very serious and real interview. But probably in the back of their minds, they're just like, oh, is this person like a hard worker? Do they seem pretty legit? Do they seem like they'll fit in on the team, put in effort and learn. And I feel like that's probably what most people are looking for in interns.
[00:10:52.120] 他们可能表面上表现得非常专业，好像在说：“是的，这是一次非常严肃认真的面试。”但实际上，他们心里可能在想：这个人工作认真吗？他/她看起来靠谱吗？他/她能融入团队、努力学习吗？我觉得这大概就是大多数人对实习生的期望吧。
[00:11:15.420] To be fair, also, it probably depends on your industry as well. I'm in design. And I did do like a marketing internship in the past. And I feel like, in those positions, it's like impossible to truly have had experience before. And you're not really going to get like tested on anything in your interview, mostly just behavioral questions. So it'd be like, okay, does this person vibe with us pretty much?
[00:11:15.420] 公平地说，这可能也取决于你所在的行业。我是做设计的，之前也做过市场营销实习。我觉得，在那种职位上，真正有相关经验几乎是不可能的。面试的时候也不会考察你什么，主要都是一些行为方面的问题。所以面试官大概会问：这个人跟我们合得来吗？
[00:11:40.980] But then like, for full time interview, it does feel much more serious. Because then it's like, okay, at least for like design, it's like, show me your portfolio, show me the projects you've worked on. What were your roles in them? Like, why are you a good fit? Why should we trust you with actually working with us nine to five every day? You know, so I guess there definitely is a bigger emphasis on like permanence with more full time roles.
[00:11:40.980] 但是，如果是全职面试，感觉就严肃多了。因为面试官会问，至少在设计类职位上，他们会问，让我看看你的作品集，看看你做过的项目，你在这些项目中担任什么角色，以及你为什么适合这份工作，为什么我们要信任你，让你每天朝九晚五地和我们一起工作。所以我觉得，全职职位确实更注重稳定性。
[00:12:06.840] It's not just three months and this person is gone. It's like we actually have to get along for the next X number of years that you're going to be at this company. So can totally see how it's more serious.
[00:12:06.840] 这不仅仅是三个月后这个人就走了。而是我们实际上还要在你未来几年待在这家公司期间保持良好的合作关系。所以，我完全理解为什么这件事会如此严肃。
[00:12:15.960] I guess it might be kind of different now in the post COVID world a little bit. But one of the distinctions that I remember from watching James and all of his like software engineer friends go through interviews back in the day, was that internship interviews were usually relatively casual as in like it was over the phone, maybe like a couple of technical questions, couple of behavioral maximum of like two to three rounds, something like that. And even that was kind of like a lot.
[00:12:15.960] 我想在后疫情时代，情况可能略有不同。但我记得以前看詹姆斯和他那些软件工程师朋友面试时，实习面试通常比较随意，比如电话面试，可能问几个技术问题，再加几个行为面试题，最多两三轮，大概就是这样。即便如此，也已经算是相当多了。
[00:12:44.440] And then I remember kind of junior year and like sophomore year summer, a lot of people were going through these interviews. And then suddenly when we were starting to do like new grad interviews in our senior year, I remember a ton of people getting flown out to do like on site interviews. Oh yeah.
[00:12:44.440] 然后我记得大概大二和大三那年的暑假，很多人都在参加面试。然后突然间，到了大四，我们开始进行应届毕业生面试的时候，我记得很多人被安排飞过去参加现场面试。哦，是的。
[00:13:01.160] And I was like, that's so crazy. But now that we've like been in full time roles, it like makes more sense to me now. It's like, oh, you want to meet this person in real life and like kind of vibe check them face to face. But I just remember back then it was like a huge culture shock to even imagine getting flown out for an interview. True. True.
[00:13:01.160] 我当时就觉得，这也太疯狂了吧。但现在我们都正式入职了，我才明白过来。就像是，哦，你想在现实生活中见到这个人，面对面地感受一下他们的气质。但我记得当时，光是想象被安排飞过去面试，就让我觉得文化冲击巨大。真的，真的。
[00:13:48.560] Yeah. You both kind of mentioned for internships, especially it's like relatively surface level or like higher level questions. But when you're actually at the internship, there's kind of some sort of expectation, right? For you to onboard in a certain period of time. So how do you think that went for your internship? And I guess what's the difference now that you look back as a full time employee? I think it depends, again, on industry.
[00:13:48.560] 是的。你们俩都提到了实习，尤其是实习期间，问的问题通常比较浅显，或者说比较高阶的问题。但真正开始实习后，公司还是会有一些期望的，对吧？比如希望你在一定时间内融入团队。那么你觉得你的实习经历如何？现在作为正式员工回过头来看，实习和实习有什么不同呢？我觉得这还是取决于行业。
[00:14:14.260] And I keep going back to like the private equity firm because when I was an intern there, I was literally, as Crystal mentioned before, doing bitch work, where it was like data entry essentially for the whole summer. So onboarding took like a day. And, you know, it was just like very straightforward. So yeah, I guess it depends on what you're actually doing. When I was doing.
[00:14:14.260] 我总是想起那家私募股权公司，因为我在那里实习的时候，就像Crystal之前提到的那样，基本上就是做一些琐碎的工作，比如整个夏天都在做数据录入。所以入职培训只用了一天时间。而且，你知道，整个过程非常简单直接。所以，我觉得这取决于你实际在做什么。我当时在做什么……
[00:14:38.000] I was doing at my current company that summer. It took me a while to even get familiar with the systems because it was such an established company. So that took a while. And then also understanding like how your piece of an internship and your project plays into what this team is actually trying to do.
[00:14:38.000] 那年夏天我在现在这家公司实习。因为公司规模很大，我花了好长时间才熟悉系统。所以这确实花了不少时间。另外，我还得弄明白实习期间你的工作和项目是如何融入团队整体目标的。
[00:14:56.260] And realize that like, oh, hey, your work is actually going to be carried forward and not just like a three month and then stop. That was really cool. But in terms of onboarding, yeah, it definitely took some time because it was just like a behemoth of a company. Like it's huge.
[00:14:56.260] 而且你会意识到，哦，嘿，你的工作成果真的会被保留下来，而不是像其他公司那样只做三个月就结束了。这一点真的很棒。但就入职培训而言，确实需要一些时间，因为这家公司规模庞大，简直是个庞然大物。
[00:15:11.380] So I guess it just also depends on like size. So it took me a while. And I think your team, again, I think I was very fortunate with my team. They're very supportive. So you can ask stupid questions and they'll answer it. And they know that like, oh, you're here for three months. Obviously, you're not going to be able to grasp everything.
[00:15:11.380] 所以我觉得这也取决于规模大小之类的因素。我花了一段时间才适应。而且我觉得我的团队——再说一遍，我觉得我很幸运能遇到我的团队。他们非常支持我。所以你可以问一些很傻的问题，他们都会回答。他们也知道，比如，哦，你在这里待三个月。显然，你不可能掌握所有东西。
[00:15:28.840] So they were really supportive and helpful in that onboarding process, which is necessary because even as a full time employee, I was in a financial rotation program when I first joined. So what it was was it was two six month rotations and one year long rotation on the finance team.
[00:15:28.840] 所以他们在入职过程中给予了我很大的支持和帮助，这非常必要，因为即使我当时是全职员工，刚入职时也参加了一个财务轮岗项目。具体来说，就是在财务团队进行两次为期六个月的轮岗，以及一次为期一年的轮岗。
[00:15:44.860] And even during my first six month rotation, my manager was like, this rotation is honestly just for you to get used to the company. Everyone knows that you're not going to be comfortable with it. And he was so right, because even during that rotation, it took me like four months till I was comfortable. And then I was like, oh, I only have two months left on this team. So I don't really know what you can achieve in an internship. You know, it's just so hard because there's so much to learn. And even to this day, like as a full time employee, sometimes I'm like, oh, why do we do that?
[00:15:44.860] 甚至在我第一个六个月的轮岗期间，我的经理就说，这次轮岗其实只是为了让你适应公司。大家都知道你肯定不会适应。他说的太对了，因为即使在那次轮岗期间，我也花了差不多四个月才真正适应。然后我就想，哦，我在这个团队只剩下两个月的时间了。所以我真的不知道实习能学到什么。你知道，实习真的很难，因为要学的东西太多了。即使到了今天，作为一名正式员工，我有时也会想，哦，我们为什么要这么做？
[00:16:14.140] Do that that way? Like you're still questioning things four years into a company. So I don't know. Onboarding as an intern is I think it's pretty overwhelming, but it's good if you have that like supportive team to help you, you know, answer questions and things like that. Oh my God, I totally know what you mean when you explain that because like my internships were kind of unique in that I actually didn't really make friends, I guess, like other intern friends, not not really.
[00:16:14.140] 那样做？感觉你入职四年了还在质疑一些事情。所以，我也不知道。我觉得实习生入职培训挺让人不知所措的，但如果有个支持你的团队帮你解答问题什么的，那就很好了。天哪，你这么解释我完全明白你的意思，因为我的实习经历也挺特别的，我其实没怎么交到朋友，那种实习生朋友，真的没有。
[00:16:43.040] But I can completely agree with how like ever since I joined my current company as a full time employee, everyone always says like, oh, yeah, don't stress too much during your first year. Honestly, it takes like six months to a year to like truly understand the inner workings of the company itself and all the systems that we use and all that.
[00:16:43.040] 但我完全同意，自从我全职加入现在的公司以来，每个人都总是说，哦，对，第一年别太紧张。说实话，确实需要六个月到一年的时间才能真正了解公司的内部运作、我们使用的所有系统等等。
[00:17:06.780] Because like, as I mentioned, it's like a big tech company. So there's just like so much convoluted stuff in there and like processes where you're like, oh, OK, like didn't know this is how we go about this or just like, you know, little tips and tricks that you like don't even know until later. I feel like there's people who've been working on my company for like 10 plus years. And sometimes I'll be like, oh, wow, I like learned something brand new today. You can use this website to find this thing, you know.
[00:17:06.780] 因为就像我刚才说的，它就像一家大型科技公司。所以里面有很多复杂的东西，还有很多流程，你会恍然大悟，哦，原来是这样，或者一些你之前根本不知道的小技巧。我觉得有些人已经在我们公司工作了十多年了。有时候我也会想，哇，我今天又学到了新东西。比如，你可以用这个网站找到这个东西。
[00:17:35.480] But yeah, I think like going back to internship stuff in one of my earlier internships, I think I was the only intern that summer, if not like one of two, maybe.
[00:17:35.480] 是的，回想我早期的实习经历，我记得那年夏天我好像是唯一的实习生，或者说只有一两个。
[00:17:47.080] It was this very small retail company called Brilliant Earth, actually. So they do like wedding rings and stuff like that. And I was on the marketing team. And because it was so like small and not many interns, I think onboarding was relatively quick because they're like, OK, guys, everyone put your heads together for this one intern.
[00:17:47.080] 那是一家叫 Brilliant Earth 的小型零售公司，他们主要卖结婚戒指之类的东西。我在市场部工作。因为公司规模很小，实习生也不多，所以我觉得入职流程比较快，他们会说：“好了，大家一起想想办法，就为了这一个实习生。”
[00:18:12.740] Like what are we going to have or do? So I had like kind of a schedule my first week, I think, where I was like, OK, Monday, meet with your team. We usually do our weekly meetings on Monday, so you'll get to see how we function. Tuesday, we're going to send you down to the ads person and they'll show you like how we run our online ads and like how, you know, all that online marketing works.
[00:18:12.740] 比如我们要做什么？第一周我大概有个日程安排，比如，周一，和你的团队开会。我们通常周一开周会，所以你可以了解一下我们的运作方式。周二，我们会安排你去见广告负责人，他会给你演示我们如何投放网络广告，以及所有网络营销的运作方式。
[00:18:38.140] And then like Wednesday, send you down to the like Google Analytics person. And then you can see how like they do their Google Analytics stuff. And then Thursday, go back to the original team that hired you and then talk about like what you're going to do over the summer. That one was really cool because I definitely learned a lot. The work that I did was mostly like observing people. And then the hands on work I did was kind of similar. It's like sort of data entry.
[00:18:38.140] 然后，比如周三，他们会安排你去见见负责谷歌分析的人。这样你就能了解他们是如何进行谷歌分析工作的。周四，他们会把你送回最初雇佣你的团队，讨论你暑期的工作安排。那次实习真的很棒，因为我确实学到了很多东西。我主要的工作是观察别人，实际操作的工作也差不多，比如数据录入之类的。
[00:19:04.920] So it's like you get to do some hands on work, but you're also learning on the side. It definitely is kind of interesting for me to hear this because going back to kind of like different industries. So the current company that I work for is probably a little bit more similar to like the retail company that you were talking about, Crystal. You know, it's relatively small, not a ton of employees, but a lot of work to get done. When I think about like onboarding, our team doesn't necessarily get interns.
[00:19:04.920] 所以，你既能亲自动手做些事情，又能顺便学习。听到这些我真的很感兴趣，因为我之前接触过不同的行业。我现在的公司可能更像你刚才提到的那家零售公司，Crystal。你知道，公司规模相对较小，员工不多，但工作量却很大。说到新员工入职，我们团队通常不会招实习生。
[00:19:32.500] But, you know, there are times where there's a new person on the team and we need to onboard them. And I just feel like the experience of onboarding them and also having once been the person getting onboarded is just so different from what you guys are describing. Because I think at a smaller company, you just jump in. Week one, you have like shit to do. You have assignments to do.
[00:19:32.500] 但是，你知道，有时候团队里会有新人，我们需要帮他们入职。我觉得，自己作为新人入职的体验，以及曾经作为新人接受入职培训的体验，和你们描述的完全不同。因为我觉得在小公司里，你直接就能上手。第一周，你就有很多事情要做。有很多任务要完成。
[00:19:53.920] When I was the person getting onboarded, I was like, oh, like this is so cool because, you know, I can like immediately kind of jump in and make an impact. And then as I kind of grew into the roles, I was like, OK, like there's a lot of stuff to do, but at least I'm getting experience quickly, which is cool. But then when I was on the other side and like onboarding people, I thought it was kind of interesting because at one point it's like I'm teaching them stuff, which I think is definitely a big thing.
[00:19:53.920] 当我刚入职的时候，感觉特别棒，因为我可以立刻上手，发挥作用。后来随着我逐渐熟悉自己的角色，我发现事情确实很多，但至少我能快速积累经验，这很不错。但当我反过来指导别人入职的时候，我觉得挺有意思的，因为有时候我感觉自己像是在教他们东西，我觉得这意义非凡。
[00:20:21.780] Showing them the inner workings of our company, et cetera. But the other side of it is like I kind of felt like I was giving out like homework. And then I think the way that you give homework to there's like a way to go about it in like a productive way versus just like giving someone kind of busy work or like something that's too easy or too hard.
[00:20:21.780] 向他们展示我们公司的内部运作等等。但另一方面，我感觉自己好像在布置作业。我觉得布置作业的方式应该讲究一些建设性，而不是仅仅布置一些无意义的、太简单或太难的作业。
[00:20:40.620] So then, you know, going back to like the whole internship part of this world, I just want to know what kind of meetings go on before intern season happens and how companies go about like choosing assignments and like three month projects. Because like you said, Taneya, what can you really do in three months? But also at the same time, like there should be something getting listed on this intern's resume. Right. Dude, that's a good question. But I actually have never worked with interns, so I can't even answer it.
[00:20:40.620] 所以，回到实习这个话题，我想知道在实习季开始前，公司会开哪些会议，以及他们如何安排实习任务和三个月的项目。就像你说的，塔尼亚，三个月能做什么呢？但同时，实习生的简历上也应该有所记录吧。对，兄弟，问得好。但我其实从来没带过实习生，所以也回答不了。
[00:21:11.240] Yeah, I think, again, when I interned for a startup, I think this was after my freshman year summer. The way that they created. OK, they didn't create projects. It was more like you said that we were just kind of pushed in to whatever they needed to get done. So over summer, it's not like we had this like project we had to present. It was more like, oh, reach out to these potential clients. So, again, it was like more out of necessity rather than like, oh, this is something that can actually help a bigger project we have planned.
[00:21:11.240] 是的，我想，我之前在一家创业公司实习的时候，应该是大一暑假之后。他们做项目的方式……好吧，其实他们并没有主动创造项目。更像是你说的，我们被安排去做他们需要完成的事情。所以整个暑假，我们并没有一个需要汇报的项目。更多的是，比如，联系一些潜在客户。所以，这更多是出于无奈，而不是因为“哦，这能帮助我们计划中的更大项目”。
[00:21:39.620] I guess I haven't worked with interns before, but I have seen conversations happen where someone is kind of like, we have a lot of work coming up. Should we consider getting an intern? Because it's like not super difficult work. That's like high level to the point where interns shouldn't be accessing this information. But it's like, you know, it could be good experience for like some young person who is about to enter the workforce.
[00:21:39.620] 我以前没带过实习生，但我见过这样的对话：有人会说，我们接下来有很多工作要做，要不要考虑招个实习生？因为这些工作难度不算特别高，也不算特别复杂，实习生不应该接触到这些信息。但对于即将步入职场的年轻人来说，这或许是一次不错的经验积累。
[00:22:06.680] I've heard those kinds of conversations happen, but I don't know what happens after that because I'm not part of that team. Also at my current company, they have a very rigorous process of getting interns. Like if I know across the company, a lot of teams do want interns, but they need like a full three month plan written out for what this intern is going to accomplish and how this plays into what you're going to do with the work that they have finished.
[00:22:06.680] 我听说过类似的对话，但我不知道之后会发生什么，因为我不属于那个团队。而且，在我现在的公司，实习生的招聘流程非常严格。据我所知，公司里很多团队都想要实习生，但他们需要一份完整的三个月计划，详细说明实习生要完成的工作，以及这些工作如何融入到他们已完成的工作中。
[00:22:35.100] So it's definitely high in demand, but also there's quite a bit of screening, I think, that goes on. Not every team can just request an intern. I guess that makes sense for like bigger companies that have more structure. They're like, all right, we're about to try and hire like thousands of interns. So like let us know why you deserve one. Yeah, that's true. And I think like at big tech companies too, I guess it depends on the role of the internship. But some of the interns get paid a lot.
[00:22:35.100] 所以实习需求肯定很高，但我觉得筛选过程也相当严格。不是每个团队都能随意申请实习生。我觉得对于规模更大、组织架构更完善的公司来说，这种做法很合理。他们会想：“好吧，我们准备招几千个实习生，所以你得告诉我们你为什么值得被录用。”没错，确实如此。而且我觉得在大型科技公司，实习生的待遇也取决于实习岗位的具体情况。有些实习生的薪水确实很高。
[00:23:04.720] Like their hourly pay, I know, for internships are sometimes higher than like the new grad full time hourly pay. So I know it can be pretty expensive, I guess, to hire an intern, even though they're only there for three months. But it's also kind of funny because so James works at the same company as you, Tanea. This year and also previous years, his team has gotten interns. I think they probably always had one.
[00:23:04.720] 我知道，实习生的时薪有时比应届毕业生的全职时薪还要高。所以我觉得，雇佣实习生成本可能相当高，即使他们只待三个月。不过也挺有意思的，因为詹姆斯和你在同一家公司工作，塔尼亚。今年以及往年，他的团队都招了实习生。我想他们可能一直都有实习生。
[00:23:29.720] And sometimes like talking to him about it, it makes it sound like they're fostering like a person or something. A child. Yeah. Because, you know, he'll be like, oh, yeah, like our intern, blah, blah, blah. And then sometimes I'm like, oh, like, did you train your intern today? And he's like, oh, well, it's not my intern. Like it's someone else's intern. I'm like, oh, so it's like a big little relationship. Like, you know, like someone's like the adoptive mother. That's so funny.
[00:23:29.720] 有时候跟他聊起这事，感觉就像他们在寄养一个人似的，像个孩子似的。是啊。因为，你知道，他会说，哦，是啊，就像我们的实习生，等等等等。然后有时候我会问，哦，你今天培训你的实习生了吗？他会说，哦，那不是我的实习生。是别人的实习生。我就说，哦，所以这就像一段小小的关系。就像，你知道，就像有人是养母一样。这太搞笑了。
[00:24:00.280] Actually, yeah, my team also has an intern right now. And they're helping with, again, like a bigger project that my team is already doing and something we're trying to accomplish by the end of the year. She's just contributing to what's already going to be done. So it's just like an extra pair of hands. I see. I guess like I had another internship experience that was also in a tech company, but it was a smaller tech company at the time.
[00:24:00.280] 是的，我们团队现在也有一个实习生。她正在协助我们团队进行一个更大的项目，也是我们计划在年底前完成的项目。她只是在为已经确定的工作贡献力量，就像是多了一双手。我明白了。我之前也有过类似的实习经历，也是在一家科技公司，不过当时那是一家规模较小的科技公司。
[00:24:27.880] We actually kind of had a class of interns, but like my internship was kind of interesting because there was no one else in our department that had an intern. So it was like just me, the graphic design intern on this one team, while all the other interns are like, I don't even know. They were like business development or like something that I just didn't even know what was going on with.
[00:24:27.880] 我们其实有个实习生班，但我的实习经历挺有意思的，因为我们部门只有我一个人带实习生。所以就只有我一个平面设计实习生在一个团队里，而其他实习生嘛，我也不知道他们在干什么。他们好像在做业务拓展之类的，反正我完全不了解。
[00:24:53.520] And then there were maybe two other interns that were kind of like me where they were in their own like department. So we bonded like us three people. We became friends. But that internship was very interesting because I didn't really have a project necessarily like during that three month time. It was more like we need a graphic designer on our team. There is a design team that already exists, but we want like an in-house designer for our team specifically.
[00:24:53.520] 当时还有另外两个实习生跟我情况类似，他们各自在自己的部门。所以我们三个就成了好朋友。那次实习很有意思，因为在那三个月里我其实并没有参与什么具体的项目。更像是我们需要一个平面设计师加入团队。公司里已经有设计团队了，但我们想专门为我们团队招聘一个内部设计师。
[00:25:23.520] So what if we got an intern and made them do it? And then we could potentially like tell upper management that we need this position on our team. I think that was their game plan. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like for a lot of smaller companies, it's more, again, out of necessity rather than quote unquote development of talent. That makes sense. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. And I'm kind of curious because there does seem to be like a sort of spectrum, right?
[00:25:23.520] 那如果我们找个实习生来做呢？然后我们就可以跟高层说我们需要这个职位了。我觉得这就是他们的策略。是啊。是啊。我觉得对很多小公司来说，这更多是出于无奈，而不是所谓的“人才培养”。这说得通。是啊，这完全说得通。我有点好奇，因为这似乎存在某种程度的差异，对吧？
[00:25:52.000] Of like we're going to kind of make this like an apprenticeship all the way up to like we need people, like we need more laborers basically on the team. So I guess for both of you guys, with your experience being on sort of different sides of the spectrum, how did that impact the pressure for your performance? So like how good you felt like you were expected to be at work? And also how did that impact the way you saw your work itself, whether it felt more like fun versus more high pressure?
[00:25:52.000] 就像我们打算把这当成一个学徒制项目，一直做到我们需要人手，基本上就是需要更多工人加入团队。所以我想，对于你们两位来说，你们的经验处于不同的极端，这会对你们的工作表现产生怎样的影响？比如，你们觉得公司对你们的工作期望有多高？还有，这会如何影响你们对工作本身的看法，让你们觉得工作更有趣还是压力更大？
[00:26:20.760] I think there's two kind of sides to this, because one, at that time when we were in college, these internships felt so important, right? Like they felt like they were going to elevate you to like the next level of life, which honestly, like looking back, you're like, OK, it wasn't that big of a deal.
[00:26:20.760] 我觉得这件事有两个方面，因为一方面，在我们上大学的时候，这些实习感觉非常重要，对吧？感觉它们能把你提升到人生的下一个阶段，但说实话，现在回头看，你会觉得，好吧，其实也没那么重要。
[00:26:43.050] But I think because we had put so much importance on internships, just like societally, it felt like you really wanted to perform well because, oh, my God, like what if that company wants to invite me back for an internship next year? Or what if that company might even want to take me on as a full time employee later on after college? So because of that, there was a certain level of performance expectation for myself, I would say.
[00:26:43.050] 但我觉得，正因为我们像社会一样非常重视实习，所以你会特别想好好表现，因为，天哪，万一那家公司明年还想邀请我回去实习呢？或者万一那家公司以后大学毕业后想聘用我做正式员工呢？所以正因为如此，我对自己抱有一定的绩效期望。
[00:27:12.990] Also, because you want them to like not feel like they fucked up hiring you as an intern. So definitely like tried to treat it as one of the most important things that was happening in my life because I was like, wow, I'm like basically an adult working right now. And I need to prove to these people that I can do good work. But I think they very rarely explain to you the way that performance reviews work, especially for like full time employees.
[00:27:12.990] 另外，你也不想让他们觉得招你做实习生是个错误。所以我当时真的把这当成人生中最重要的事情之一，因为我感觉，哇，我现在基本上算是个正式员工了。我需要向他们证明我能做好工作。但我认为他们很少会解释绩效考核是怎么回事，尤其是对正式员工来说。
[00:27:41.450] Right. So you kind of just have no gauge. You just go like, OK, I'm just going to work hard. Maybe you don't really have like goals that would align with a specific job ladder because you don't know what that means yet. But it's just like I have a goal to do well to finish this project or, you know, like stuff like that. Yeah, I think mine is similar.
[00:27:41.450] 对。所以你基本上没什么衡量标准。你只能想，好吧，我要努力工作。也许你并没有设定与特定职业晋升路径相对应的目标，因为你还不清楚那意味着什么。但你的目标是做好这个项目，或者诸如此类的事情。嗯，我觉得我的情况也差不多。
[00:28:00.290] Well, in the companies where I didn't necessarily have a project, it was more like self-inflicted, like I want to do well, mostly because I need like academic validation. So it kind of carried over to the real world. I was like, oh, I have this task, like you mentioned, Crystal, and I just want to do well. At my current company, when I interned here, it was again, we had a project. And at the end of the internship, it was being evaluated. And that determined if you were going to get a full time offer.
[00:28:00.290] 嗯，在那些我没有具体项目的公司里，我更多的是自我激励，想把事情做好，主要是因为我需要学术上的认可。这种心态也延续到了实际工作中。就像你刚才提到的，Crystal，我当时就想，哦，我有个任务，我只想把它做好。在我现在的公司，我实习的时候，我们也有项目。实习结束时，我们会对项目进行评估。评估结果决定了你是否能获得正式工作机会。
[00:28:29.750] And this was between like junior and senior year. So like if I got the full time offer, then I wouldn't necessarily have to interview again and go through that process. So it was very like desirable to get that return offer.
[00:28:29.750] 当时正值大三升大四之间。所以，如果我拿到全职offer，就不一定需要再次面试，也不用经历那套流程了。因此，能拿到那份返聘offer对我来说非常理想。
[00:28:41.350] So there's definitely a lot more pressure because the way that they had evaluated it is like after you finish your project, you have to write this doc, essentially document where you outline kind of what the problem statement was, what you did over the three months, how this is going to carry over after you leave and what improvements still need to be made, etc.
[00:28:41.350] 所以压力肯定更大了，因为他们的评估方式是，项目完成后，你必须写一份文档，基本上就是一份概述问题陈述、你三个月来所做的事情、在你离开后这项工作将如何延续以及还需要进行哪些改进等的文档。
[00:29:01.510] And then they have your manager, your mentor, and then somebody completely outside of your organization come in, read that doc, and ask you questions. And then you leave the room and then they make the decision on whether or not you get a return offer or not. Oh my God. Wait, yours was so intense. Yeah. So again, so it was like the last three weeks of our internship, like all the interns were working so heavily on even the document itself because it was the one piece of evidence that you have.
[00:29:01.510] 然后他们会叫你的经理、你的导师，以及一个完全不在你公司内部的人进来，一起阅读那份文件，并问你问题。之后你离开房间，他们再决定是否给你提供返岗机会。我的天哪。等等，你的经历太紧张了。是啊。所以，在我们实习的最后三周，所有实习生都在拼命研究那份文件，因为它是你唯一的证据。
[00:29:31.510] It was like the last three weeks of your work. It was like the last three weeks of your work that this outside person is going to see because your manager knows you well, your mentor knows you well, but they're not the final decision maker in your return offer. Wow. Yeah. So because of that, it was definitely a lot more pressure during that summer where I was like, oh my gosh, I really don't want to interview again. Like I have to do this. It definitely added a lot of pressure. Dude, that's literally like a final thesis or something.
[00:29:31.510] 感觉就像你最后三周的工作成果。就像这个局外人会看到你最后三周的工作成果一样，因为你的经理很了解你，你的导师也很了解你，但他们并不是你最终能否获得聘用的决定者。哇。是啊。所以，那年夏天我压力真的很大，我当时想，天哪，我真的不想再面试了。但我又不得不去面试。这真的让我压力倍增。老兄，那简直就像在写毕业论文一样。
[00:30:00.570] Like it was crazy. I didn't expect to be writing documents. This was a six page document. Oh my God. Oh my God. So it was a rigorous process, but also I think my company does things very differently than other companies. Like I think other companies have like presentations or things like that. But still, there was a high emphasis on getting that document well written and like proofread by your manager, by other people in your org to make sure it makes sense.
[00:30:00.570] 简直太疯狂了。我没想到自己会写文件。这可是六页纸的文件啊！我的天哪！我的天哪！所以整个流程非常严格，而且我觉得我们公司和其他公司做事的方式很不一样。比如，其他公司可能会有演示之类的环节。但即便如此，我们公司仍然非常重视文件的撰写，而且要经过经理和公司其他同事的校对，确保内容通顺易懂。
[00:30:29.630] Lots of emphasis on that final document. Dude, that's crazy. Yeah. Wow. I'm like low key glad I was never part of a giant intern class now because with that much structure and like that much of a end assessment, I don't know if I would have survived. Yeah. Because like you said, like you're hiring thousands of interns for that summer, but you can't hire all those people for full time. Like no way. The company doesn't have those resources.
[00:30:29.630] 最终文件真的太重要了。老兄，这也太疯狂了吧。是啊。哇。我现在有点庆幸自己没参加过那种大型实习生项目，因为结构这么严谨，期末考核又这么严格，我真不知道自己能不能撑过去。是啊。就像你说的，你们夏天招了成千上万的实习生，但不可能把所有人都转正。绝对不可能。公司没那么多资源。
[00:30:57.810] Now I'm starting to realize why it's such a rigorous process to make sure you have a good bunch of people that you're hiring for a new grad. I remember, especially during junior and senior year, but even during like sophomore year of college, I remember there were so many rumors, so many discussions about who got a return offer, who didn't.
[00:30:57.810] 现在我开始明白为什么招聘应届毕业生需要如此严格的流程，以确保招到一批优秀的人才。我记得，尤其是在大三和大四的时候，甚至大二的时候，就有很多关于谁拿到返聘offer、谁没拿到的传言和讨论。
[00:31:20.150] I still remember there was some person who was rumored to have gotten a full time return offer when we were sophomores, which was just crazy. And then I remember like junior to senior year summer. So like same as you, Taneha, like a bunch of people were kind of hinging on their internship, giving them a full time job so that the rest of senior year would be fun.
[00:31:20.150] 我还记得我们大二的时候，有传言说有人拿到了一份全职工作邀请，真是太疯狂了。然后我还记得大三到大四的暑假，就像你一样，塔尼哈，很多人都把希望寄托在实习上，指望着能找到一份全职工作，这样大四剩下的时间就能过得开心了。
[00:31:41.770] And I remember hearing like, oh, did you know, like the entire insert city office of insert company, like didn't get a return offer? Like they're so fucked, blah, blah, blah. And just so many people were talking about it. And I guess because I was kind of like on the outside of this, like this wasn't like my world that I was trying to go into. Like I thought it was like very, very interesting to hear the rumors.
[00:31:41.770] 我记得当时听到有人说，你知道吗，好像整个[某公司]在[某城市]的办公室都没收到返岗通知？他们真是倒霉透了，等等等等。好多人都在议论这件事。我想是因为我当时有点置身事外，这并非我原本想涉足的领域，所以我觉得这些传闻特别有意思。
[00:32:04.270] It's funny that you mentioned how rigorous your current company conversion rate was because James went through the same thing and he was a fall quarter intern. And I remember I went, so he came to visit me like in September Labor Day. And then I went to visit him. I think it was something like early December, maybe like late October. And he had lost like 15 pounds because he was working so much that quarter. And it worked and he got the full time offer.
[00:32:04.270] 你提到你们公司严格的转正率，这很有意思，因为詹姆斯也经历过同样的过程，他当时是秋季学期的实习生。我记得我去过他公司，大概是九月劳动节那会儿，他来找过我。然后我又去看了他，大概是十二月初，也可能是十月底。他那学期工作很忙，瘦了大概15磅。结果他成功了，拿到了正式offer。
[00:32:34.530] But he I think he probably worked harder during the internship than like his current role now. And he works quite a lot now. So pretty crazy to think about, you know, someone being less than 22 years old going through something more intense than like a real job at the same company. I guess because it's like it really is kind of in that case, like securing your future of it.
[00:32:34.530] 但我认为他实习期间的工作强度可能比现在的工作强度还要大。而且他现在的工作量也很大。想想都觉得不可思议，一个不到22岁的人，竟然要经历比在同一家公司正式工作还要高强度的实习。我想，这就像是在为自己的未来做打算一样。
[00:32:58.270] It's like, oh, if I can get this lined up for sure, then it just takes a load off your shoulders for the rest of your like senior year, as you said, Jisoo. Yeah. Wow. I like did not live that life. Dude, my internship experience was like so much more lax than that. I'm going to be completely honest. I think for me, though, I was also studying abroad fall quarter senior year, which is literally when you recruit.
[00:32:58.270] 感觉就像，哦，如果我能把这件事安排妥当，那就像你说的，Jisoo，你大四剩下的时间就轻松多了。是啊。哇。我可没经历过那种生活。老兄，我的实习经历比那轻松多了。我实话实说。不过，我觉得对我来说，大四秋季学期我还在国外留学，那正是你找工作的时候。
[00:33:26.290] So that's why I was hinging on this return offer because I was like, I cannot recruit from abroad. Like that's going to be miserable. So that's why I need this to work out right now. I think my experience was like so much more casual. My internship for that junior year summer was the one that I mentioned. I was like the sole graphic designer for my team. I think they were just like, wow, this is working out really well.
[00:33:26.290] 所以，我当时就特别看重这个回聘机会，因为我觉得我不能从国外招人，那样太难了。所以我现在必须确保这件事能成。我觉得我的经历比较轻松随意。我之前提到的那个实习，就是大三暑假的实习。我当时是我们团队唯一的平面设计师。我觉得他们当时肯定觉得，哇，这工作做得真不错。
[00:33:51.950] We love that you're able to like do the things that we wanted our intern to do. So would you like to just keep interning for the rest of the school year? We'll just take you on as kind of a contractor slash like whatever it's called. Just an hourly worker, essentially. They're like, we know you're in school, so it'll be totally chill. Like just work the hours that you can log it in the timesheet and we'll let you know if there's any like important thing. I was like, OK, sounds great.
[00:33:51.950] 我们很高兴你能做我们希望实习生做的事情。所以，你愿意继续实习到学年结束吗？我们会以合同工或类似其他形式聘用你，基本上就是按小时计薪。他们说，我们知道你在上学，所以一切都会很轻松。你只需要在工时表上记录你的工作时间，如果有什么重要的事情我们会通知你。我当时就想，好的，听起来不错。
[00:34:20.410] It's because it was like I was like if I'm interning during the school year, then maybe like after school, we'll figure something out for like full time employment. That was like the goal. Right. But yeah, it was like so much more casual. They're like, OK, cool. Sounds great. Like I'm gonna go hit up HR and we'll send you an email in like a couple of weeks. And I was like, OK, sounds good. That's nice.
[00:34:20.410] 因为我当时的想法是，如果我在学年期间实习，那么毕业后我们或许可以一起想办法转正。这就是我的目标。没错。但确实，整个过程比较随意。他们会说，好的，没问题。听起来不错。然后他们会说，我会联系人力资源部，大概两周后会给你发邮件。我就说，好的，听起来不错。挺好的。
[00:34:45.430] I mean, definitely for me during my internship, it wasn't all busy because the project itself, again, they're not going to give you something that you can't complete in three months. And if you're a good worker, like chances are you'll finish it and you'll finish it earlier. So there were times when I was just like playing ping pong with my friends. Like I definitely had those days, too. Like I wasn't grinding it out the whole summer. I'm glad.
[00:34:45.430] 我的意思是，就我而言，实习期间并非一直都很忙，因为项目本身，他们不会给你三个月都完成不了的任务。如果你工作认真，很有可能就能完成，甚至提前完成。所以有时候我也会和朋友们打乒乓球。我的确也有过这样的日子。我并没有整个夏天都拼命工作。我很庆幸。
[00:35:10.410] To me, that's kind of like one of the most iconic things when I imagine intern season. I have vague memories of watching the movie The Internship back in high school where, you know, they walk through some big tech company office. I think it was Google. Yeah. And, you know, people are like doing the most outrageous thing, like sleeping in nap pods. And, you know, there's just like all these crazy rooms and things like that. And I just remember one of James's internships, they did go to that baseball game.
[00:35:10.410] 对我来说，这简直就是我印象中实习季最经典的场景之一。我隐约记得高中时看过一部叫《实习生》的电影，里面他们参观了一家大型科技公司的办公室。我想应该是谷歌吧。对。你知道，里面的人都在做各种匪夷所思的事情，比如睡在睡眠舱里。还有各种各样奇奇怪怪的房间之类的。我还记得詹姆斯实习的时候，他们也去看过那场棒球比赛。
[00:35:37.990] And I think like I don't think they were quite 21, but I guess like it was very easy to get alcohol back then. Or like, you know, just since there's like also full time employees and stuff. And I was just like, what kind of internship is, you know what I mean? I was just like you, I think you're just partying with your friends. Like this does not seem like real corporate culture. Yeah.
[00:35:37.990] 我觉得他们可能还没满21岁，但那时候弄到酒应该很容易。或者，你知道，因为那里也有全职员工什么的。我就想，这算什么实习啊，你懂我的意思吗？我就觉得，你是不是就跟朋友们一起开派对？这看起来根本不像真正的企业文化。是啊。
[00:35:58.730] And honestly, it kind of wasn't because during the internship, my current company, they put us in like corporate housing, which ended up being dorms at the local university. So everyone was just kind of together close by and like, you know, people would like get to know each other. So it was like an extension of college for that summer. So it wasn't fully professional.
[00:35:58.730] 说实话，其实也不完全算，因为实习期间，我现在的公司给我们安排了公司宿舍，其实就是当地大学的宿舍。所以大家都住在一起，彼此也比较熟悉。那年夏天，感觉就像是大学的延伸。所以，实习并不完全是职业性的。
[00:36:20.050] It was more like, oh, hey, this is a nice like break from school where we have like free time and free weekends to like, you know, explore the city, hang out. And so it was, again, that like lively atmosphere that was just brought throughout the summer. Dang, dude. All my internships were in San Francisco. So I just stayed at home and I took BART every morning. Me and my friend, we both had to commute to SF from East Bay.
[00:36:20.050] 感觉更像是，哦，嘿，这真是个不错的假期，我们可以好好休息，周末也有空闲时间，可以去探索城市，和朋友们一起玩。所以，那种活力四射的氛围一直延续到整个夏天。哎，兄弟。我的所有实习都在旧金山。所以我只能待在家里，每天早上坐BART（旧金山湾区捷运）。我和我的朋友都得从东湾通勤到旧金山。
[00:36:48.630] So we would text each other in the morning and be like, hey, you up time to carpool over to BART and like hop on BART. And dude, I think in the beginning of the summer, we were really good about it. But I'm not a morning person. So by the end of the summer, I was like, just go without me. I'll catch the later BART. It's kind of funny that you mentioned that because even during my internship, I remember feeling so drained all the time.
[00:36:48.630] 所以早上我们会互相发短信，比如“嘿，你醒了，该拼车去BART站了”，然后一起坐BART。哥们儿，我觉得夏天刚开始的时候，我们配合得特别好。但我早上起不来。所以到了夏天末，我就想，你们自己去吧，我坐晚一班的BART。你提到这个还挺有意思的，因为我记得即使在我实习的时候，也总是感觉很疲惫。
[00:37:15.650] That was the biggest difference from college is when you go to college and when you go to your classes, you have periods in between where you're like, oh, I'm just going to watch an episode of Netflix or I'm just going to chill out. But then your internship is your first experience where you're like literally brain on from like nine to five with like a lunch break or whatever, you know. So it's like by the end of that summer, I was so tired. And I was like, wow, I cannot imagine doing this full time. And yeah, here we are. Here we are.
[00:37:15.650] 大学和实习最大的区别在于，上大学的时候，课间会有空闲时间，你可以看看Netflix或者放松一下。但实习是你第一次真正意义上从早上九点到下午五点都得全神贯注，中间只有午休时间。所以到了那个夏天结束的时候，我累得不行。我就想，哇，我简直无法想象全职做实习。结果，现在我真的做到了。
[00:37:45.630] I want to ask a little bit more about that because I think you're right on the nose of like the thoughts of an internship or like going to work at this big corporation. When you're in college is probably way different from when you're a full time employee. So like if you had to compare and contrast your mindset towards work or like your outlook about the company, things like that. How has it changed since you were a student versus now? Oh, my God.
[00:37:45.630] 我想再多问一点，因为我觉得你说的很对，这正切合了实习或者去大公司工作的想法。大学生活和全职工作肯定截然不同。所以，如果你要比较一下你对工作的态度，或者你对公司的看法等等，从学生时代到现在，这些想法发生了哪些变化？我的天哪。
[00:38:12.490] Wait, this is actually really funny because when you're asking that, I'm like reflecting. And I was actually so proud to like be an intern and like go to work. I was like, dude, I'm like such an important person. I'm contributing to society. Like I have a job. Like I don't know what it was, but there was something so like self-fulfilling about it. Like it made you so proud.
[00:38:12.490] 等等，这其实挺搞笑的，因为你问这个问题的时候，我正好在反思。我当时真的特别自豪能当实习生，能去上班。我就想，哇，我感觉自己好重要啊！我在为社会做贡献！我有工作了！我也不知道为什么，但就是那种感觉，特别有成就感，特别让人自豪。
[00:38:39.590] And I was like, I'm commuting to the city to like do my internship. I'm so important. My grown up job. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, I need to like try my best not to look too young and like look as professional as I can. I was like, can't look stupid in front of these adults, you know? Yeah. I think that was the general overall feeling because it's so new. And like you've never had an experience like that before because like compared to now, it's like, oh, great.
[00:38:39.590] 我当时就想，我要去城里实习，我可是很重要的。我的正式工作。是啊，是啊。然后我就想，我得尽量让自己看起来不那么年轻，尽可能显得专业。我当时就想，不能在这些大人面前出丑，你知道吗？是啊。我觉得当时大家普遍都有这种感觉，因为一切都太新鲜了。就像你以前从未有过这样的经历，因为跟现在比起来，感觉就像，哦，太棒了。
[00:39:06.650] Got to wake up early for like some 9 a.m. meeting, you know? Yeah. I think my perception has definitely changed since being in college because, again, like Crystal mentioned, you think you're doing the most important stuff as an intern. Like you're like, wow, I'm at this great company. They're going to use my work going forward, et cetera. Like, again, you're very proud. And I was very proud too.
[00:39:06.650] 你知道，有时候得早起去参加早上九点的会议。是啊。我觉得自从上了大学，我的想法确实改变了，因为就像Crystal说的那样，你会觉得实习生做的都是最重要的事。你会想，哇，我在这么棒的公司工作。他们以后肯定会用到我的工作成果，等等。你会非常自豪。我当时也确实很自豪。
[00:39:29.710] And now as a full-time employee, like not to get super like morbid or sad, but just like there are so many times where I've just been like, what am I doing? Like what am I contributing to society? You know, all things that don't matter. So it's more of like an existential crisis nowadays than it was when I was interning or in college. Because, again, you're like looking up to being, you know, a working woman, earning money, and that's like super exciting.
[00:39:29.710] 现在我成了全职员工，我不想显得特别悲观或悲伤，但很多时候我都会想，我到底在做什么？我对社会有什么贡献？你知道，所有这些事情其实都不重要。所以，现在的这种感觉更像是存在主义危机，而不是像我实习或大学时期那样。因为，你会很憧憬成为一名职业女性，赚钱，这真的非常令人兴奋。
[00:39:58.890] And for others, it might still be where your job is like super fulfilling. But for me, it's more like, oh my gosh, none of this really matters. Nobody in this room actually knows what they're talking about. Like everyone is confused, you know? It's just, you just like realize that everyone is the same as you. Like, I don't know. I don't know how to describe it. Like we're much more jaded now. We're like, okay, yeah, this is just a typical workday. Sometimes we get an exciting project, but overall it's just like, yeah, this is just life now.
[00:39:58.890] 对有些人来说，这份工作或许依然充满成就感。但对我来说，感觉更像是，天哪，这一切根本毫无意义。这屋子里没人真正知道自己在说什么。大家都一头雾水，你知道吗？你会突然意识到，其实每个人都和你一样。我不知道该怎么形容。我们现在变得更加麻木了。我们会想，好吧，这只是个普通的工作日。有时候我们会遇到一些令人兴奋的项目，但总的来说，这就是生活。
[00:40:30.030] There's something so sad about that. Like I get that it's very natural because new things are always exciting. And then old things, you get so accustomed to it. And I think it probably leaves more room for doubt and stuff. But like nowadays, when you see interns on your floor in your building, do you feel like, oh, you know, I was once you. Like I know exactly what's going through your mind. And does it make you kind of want to mentor them at all? Or do you just want to observe from afar and be like, you'll go through what I'm going through later?
[00:40:30.030] 这其中有些令人伤感的地方。我知道这很正常，因为新鲜事物总是令人兴奋。而旧事物，你会习以为常。我觉得这可能更容易滋生疑虑之类的情绪。但就像现在，当你看到同楼层的实习生时，你会不会觉得，哦，你知道吗，我曾经也是你们中的一员。就好像我完全了解你们的内心想法。这会让你想要指导他们吗？还是你只想远远地观察，然后说，你们以后也会经历我正在经历的一切？
[00:41:01.650] I think it's nice to mentor. I think it's fun. You know, I think whenever I have like these chats with these interns or even new grads now, I try to emphasize and I don't want them to like think like nothing matters. But I want them to know that if you make a mistake or if like something happens, it's not the end of the world. Because when I was starting off and even during my internship, I was like, everything has to be perfect. If I don't, I'll get fired or something ridiculous.
[00:41:01.650] 我觉得指导别人挺好的，也很有趣。你知道，每当我跟实习生或者应届毕业生聊天的时候，我都会强调一点，我不想让他们觉得一切都不重要。我想让他们明白，即使犯了错或者发生了什么事，也不是世界末日。因为我刚开始工作的时候，甚至实习期间，我都觉得一切都必须完美。如果我做不到，就会被炒鱿鱼或者发生一些很荒谬的事情。
[00:41:29.090] When, you know, in reality, like people mess up all the time. You just have to be quick to respond. And it's like really not a big deal. And, you know, a couple days later, no one's going to really be thinking about it. So I think I want to get that in their heads where it's like, it's fine if you mess up. It's part of the process. It's okay. It happens. But it is nice to observe them as well because you're like, oh, you're so happy and joyful. Like, give me some of that energy.
[00:41:29.090] 你知道，现实生活中，人总是会犯错。你只需要迅速做出反应。这真的没什么大不了的。你知道，过几天，没人会再想起这件事。所以我想让他们明白，犯错没关系。这是过程的一部分。没关系。这种事难免发生。但观察他们也挺好的，因为你会觉得，哦，你真开心，真快乐。就像，给我点儿这种能量吧。
[00:41:55.070] It's like when you said in the beginning of the episode, intern season is so lively. And now I'm realizing it. It's because they're so excited about their work. And everyone else, usually we're just like, yeah, another day at work. We're like dead inside. We need that energy, though, to like keep things alive. True. You're like, wow, they're so happy. Like, we were once like them.
[00:41:55.070] 就像你在节目开头说的那样，实习生的季节总是那么热闹。现在我才明白。那是因为他们对工作充满热情。而我们其他人，通常就只是觉得，唉，又是一天的工作。我们内心就像行尸走肉。但我们需要那种活力，才能让一切保持生机。没错。你会觉得，哇，他们真开心。我们曾经也和他们一样。
[00:42:19.850] Dude, it's low-key cringe thinking back on how proud I was to be an intern. Love the usage. Love the application. But it was a happy time. I think like overall, at least in my specific experience, internship was like very fun, learned a lot and like pretty low stakes. I can't say the same for everyone. Clearly, today, this wasn't that low stakes.
[00:42:19.850] 老兄，现在回想起来，当初做实习生时那种自豪感真是有点尴尬。我喜欢它的用途，也喜欢它的应用。但那段时光确实很快乐。我觉得总的来说，至少就我个人的经历而言，实习非常有趣，学到了很多东西，而且风险也比较低。当然，我不能保证每个人都这么觉得。显然，今天的情况就没那么轻松了。
[00:42:49.750] I still think like an internship over the summer or like whenever, it's like a pretty fun experience overall. Yeah, and I think you also meet if you are fortunate enough to have a cohort or like meet people. You also meet really fun people. And there's friends that I made during my internship that I'm still close to now. Like I'm going to be a bridesmaid for one of my friends that I made during my internship. Yeah. So it's just I don't know.
[00:42:49.750] 我仍然觉得暑期实习或者其他任何实习机会，总体来说都是一段非常有趣的经历。是的，而且我觉得如果你足够幸运，能和一群人一起实习，或者认识一些人，你也会遇到很多有趣的人。我在实习期间结识的一些朋友，现在仍然保持着密切的联系。比如，我还要当我在实习期间认识的一个朋友的伴娘。是的。所以，我也不知道该怎么说。
[00:43:16.950] It's a nice way to meet people from different schools and outside your like social circle in college, which was fun. I guess it's also fun because like today you got to intern in a different city for one of your internships, right? I sadly only interned at home, but I feel like it's like super fun just hearing about how you said like you guys got put into dorms and like it was a new city. You got to explore the new city for a summer.
[00:43:16.950] 这是个结识不同学校、大学社交圈之外的人的好方法，挺有意思的。我觉得也挺有意思的，比如你今天去另一个城市实习，对吧？可惜我只能在本地实习，不过听你说你们被安排住进宿舍，去一个全新的城市，感觉特别棒。你们还利用暑假探索了那个新城市。
[00:43:43.870] That is also like a super fun aspect of interning, I think, because it's not a permanent move, but you do get to spend some time. It's almost like studying abroad, except you're working. Yeah. But it's nice because you're making money so you can actually like explore and not be like, oh my gosh, should I eat out? True. Well, it has been super fun kind of listening to both of your experiences on internships.
[00:43:43.870] 我觉得实习的一大乐趣就在于此，因为它不是永久性的，但你确实可以在那里待一段时间。这有点像出国留学，只不过你是在工作。是啊。好处在于你能赚钱，所以你可以真正地去探索，而不是纠结于“天哪，我该出去吃饭吗？”。没错。听你们俩分享实习经历真的很有趣。
[00:44:08.030] I find it absolutely hilarious that Taneo was like, yeah, if there's one thing I want to say to interns, it's that it's really hard to fire someone legally. So you're fine. And I think the other fun part too of intern season is like, you know, sometimes interns fuck up somewhat semi-publicly. Sometimes you get that occasional email in summer that's like test and the body is from like a big corporation. I'm like, that's an intern.
[00:44:08.030] 我觉得塔尼奥说的那句话简直太搞笑了，他说，如果要跟实习生们说一句话，那就是合法解雇一个人真的很难。所以你们不用担心。我觉得实习季另一个有趣的地方是，你知道，有时候实习生会犯一些半公开的错误。有时候夏天你会收到一些邮件，内容是测试，邮件正文来自某个大公司。我就想，这肯定是实习生干的。
