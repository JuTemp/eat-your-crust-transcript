[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal
[00:00:00.050] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。
[00:00:13.740] This is a very special episode because
[00:00:13.740] 这是一集非常特别的剧集，因为
[00:00:20.050] It finally lined up to our official anniversary today as this episode is released it is our
[00:00:20.050] 今天这集节目播出，恰逢我们的官方周年纪念日，真是太好了！
[00:00:27.890] fifth year anniversary of having Eat Your Crust
[00:00:27.890] 《吃掉你的饼皮》五周年纪念
[00:00:32.250] Yay!
[00:00:32.250] 耶！
[00:00:34.530] It feels a little bit surreal to say that because I think the podcast is just so integrated into our lifestyle that it's almost a part of our daily routine now
[00:00:34.530] 这么说感觉有点不真实，因为我觉得播客已经完全融入了我们的生活方式，几乎成了我们日常生活的一部分。
[00:00:43.890] So to think about all the different
[00:00:43.890] 所以要考虑所有不同的
[00:00:46.130] Years that we've accumulated into this project and that culminating into a five-year-old project literal kindergarten
[00:00:46.130] 我们多年来在这个项目上积累的经验，最终成就了一个历时五年的项目——名副其实的幼儿园。
[00:00:53.890] Dude, it's just crazy. It really is. Oh my god five years is longer than college
[00:00:53.890] 老兄，这简直太疯狂了。真的太疯狂了。我的天，五年比大学还长！
[00:01:01.850] It's longer than high school
[00:01:01.850] 比高中还长
[00:01:04.930] And I feel like for the most part not a ton has changed for us on the day to day
[00:01:04.930] 我觉得对我们来说，日常生活的大部分变化并不大。
[00:01:09.450] But looking back we've made some pretty big strides in terms of how we organize stuff or even prepare for episodes or even
[00:01:09.450] 但回顾过去，我们在组织工作、节目准备等方面都取得了相当大的进步。
[00:01:16.570] Prepare our guests for episodes as well. Oh my god
[00:01:16.570] 也请让我们的嘉宾做好观看节目的准备。我的天哪
[00:01:19.730] So true before we were more established just thinking back at the chaos that we were
[00:01:19.730] 确实如此，在我们站稳脚跟之前，回想一下我们当时的混乱局面。
[00:01:26.370] Operating under is insane because it didn't seem like chaos at the time although sometimes it did
[00:01:26.370] 在这种管理模式下运作简直是疯了，因为当时看起来并不混乱，尽管有时确实如此。
[00:01:32.890] But once we started getting more and more organized every time we think back on those days
[00:01:32.890] 但自从我们开始变得越来越有条理之后，每当我们回想起那些日子……
[00:01:38.050] It's like how are we doing this? I feel like the biggest change for us that has helped us be less chaotic
[00:01:38.050] 这就像我们该怎么做？我觉得对我们来说，最大的改变就是让我们不再那么混乱。
[00:01:44.930] Is we no longer
[00:01:44.930] 我们是否不再
[00:01:47.050] Plan everything the week of oh my god basically we used to meet on Wednesdays which hasn't changed actually
[00:01:47.050] 计划好活动周的所有事情，我的天哪，我们以前都是周三见面，其实现在也没变。
[00:01:53.010] Oh, it has changed. Oh, yeah, it used to be Tuesdays
[00:01:53.010] 哦，变了。哦，以前是星期二。
[00:01:55.850] Wait, it's now Tuesdays. Oh wait. No, you're right. You're right before you speak once
[00:01:55.850] 等等，今天是星期二。哦，等等。不，你说得对。你还没开口就说对了。
[00:02:00.490] But we submit on Wednesday to prepare for the recording that weekend
[00:02:00.490] 但我们会在周三提交，以便为周末的录音做准备。
[00:02:04.850] Which I feel like if it was just us two
[00:02:04.850] 我觉得如果只有我们两个人的话……
[00:02:06.610] It's fine
[00:02:06.610] 没关系
[00:02:06.970] But sometimes when you have to find a guest a lot of whom are like friends and have their own busy lifestyles and schedules
[00:02:06.970] 但有时你需要寻找客人，而他们中的许多人就像朋友一样，都有自己忙碌的生活方式和日程安排。
[00:02:12.650] It would just be ultimate chaos on like who is free to record this weekend
[00:02:12.650] 如果这周末谁有空录音，那场面肯定会乱成一团。
[00:02:16.850] And I think in the beginning there was definitely a period of time where we didn't even meet
[00:02:16.850] 我觉得一开始确实有一段时间我们甚至都没见过面。
[00:02:22.570] Right we just texted like oh my god should we ask this person to record in like two or three days?
[00:02:22.570] 我们刚才发短信问，天哪，我们是不是应该让这个人两三天后录音？
[00:02:28.050] Oh my god
[00:02:28.050] 我的天啊
[00:02:29.690] There's actually some funny stories with this level of chaos one of our friends Brian is like a peak victim to this
[00:02:29.690] 在这种混乱局面下，其实也发生过一些趣事，我们的朋友布莱恩就是个典型的例子。
[00:02:36.810] We basically
[00:02:36.810] 我们基本上
[00:02:38.410] Texted him and was like hey, are you free this weekend? We love to record an episode with you
[00:02:38.410] 我给他发了短信，问他这周末有空吗？我们很想和你一起录一期节目。
[00:02:41.970] And he was like oh sure I'm down. What's the topic about and we were like, oh, we'll tell you when you like
[00:02:41.970] 他当时就说，哦，当然可以，没问题。话题是什么？我们说，哦，等你准备好了再告诉你。
[00:02:48.010] Oh
[00:02:48.010] 哦
[00:02:49.170] My god showed up and we had some like we had a couple options for him
[00:02:49.170] 我的上帝出现了，我们好像有几个选择来应对他。
[00:02:53.170] But all of them were kind of serious and like dark and brooding kind of topic ideas
[00:02:53.170] 但所有这些话题都比较严肃，而且都有些阴郁沉重。
[00:02:57.930] And then I just remember he was like oh, I feel like a little bit nervous about this
[00:02:57.930] 然后我就记得他当时说，哦，我对此有点紧张。
[00:03:04.050] Yeah
[00:03:04.050] 是的
[00:03:05.610] So we recorded a new episode with him recently
[00:03:05.610] 所以，我们最近和他一起录制了一期新节目。
[00:03:09.490] It was the emotional outburst episode and before we started recording that one Brian was like wow
[00:03:09.490] 那是情绪爆发的那一集，在我们开始录制之前，布莱恩惊呼：“哇！”
[00:03:16.090] I feel so much more prepared for this episode like you guys gave me an outline this time
[00:03:16.090] 感觉这次你们给了我一份详细的提纲，让我对这期节目准备得更充分了。
[00:03:20.890] You told me the topic beforehand
[00:03:20.890] 你事先告诉我主题了。
[00:03:23.170] You asked me like a couple weeks in advance and we were like oh wait what happened last time?
[00:03:23.170] 你提前两周就问我了，我们当时就想，哦等等，上次发生了什么事？
[00:03:28.470] And he was like oh, I just kind of showed up
[00:03:28.470] 他当时说，哦，我就这么突然出现了。
[00:03:31.650] It was handed a topic. Yeah, I
[00:03:31.650] 有人给了我一个题目。是的，我
[00:03:34.770] Remember another really funny one. There's this one week where I think we had planned kind of ahead
[00:03:34.770] 还记得另一件特别搞笑的事吗？有那么一周，我们好像提前做了些计划。
[00:03:40.970] But it was only in our heads like oh, we'll ask this person on Tuesday or Wednesday to record on Saturday
[00:03:40.970] 但这只是我们脑子里的想法，比如，我们会在周二或周三请这个人周六来录音。
[00:03:48.330] And then when we asked them they were like oh, sorry. I'm not free this weekend and we were like wait
[00:03:48.330] 然后我们问他们的时候，他们说哦，不好意思，这周末没空，我们就说等等
[00:03:54.010] We're stupid. Why did we just assume this person would be free?
[00:03:54.010] 我们真是愚蠢。为什么我们会想当然地认为这个人是自由身呢？
[00:03:57.850] And so we were like kind of panicking and we're thinking like oh shoot
[00:03:57.850] 所以当时我们有点慌，心想糟了。
[00:04:02.250] Should we do like a two-person episode then or should we look for other potential guests?
[00:04:02.250] 那我们应该做一期两人嘉宾的节目，还是应该寻找其他潜在的嘉宾？
[00:04:08.330] We ended up asking someone on I believe it was like Thursday if they could record with us on Friday
[00:04:08.330] 最后，我们大概在周四那天问了某人，能不能周五和我们一起录音。
[00:04:16.410] Literally the next day and luckily they were like yeah, okay. I can do that
[00:04:16.410] 第二天，幸运的是，他们就答应了，说“好的，我可以做”。
[00:04:22.010] Dude we have some absolute angels for friends truly. We're much better about it now but back then
[00:04:22.010] 老兄，我们真的有一些天使般的朋友。我们现在处理得好多了，但以前……
[00:04:30.010] Yeah, I'm like why did these people say yes to us?
[00:04:30.010] 是啊，我就想，这些人为什么会答应我们的请求？
[00:04:33.770] I remember when we were discussing this topic idea on our call earlier
[00:04:33.770] 我记得我们之前在电话里讨论过这个话题。
[00:04:38.250] You mentioned the way we used to do our podcast was like living paycheck to paycheck. Oh my god completely unsustainable
[00:04:38.250] 你提到我们以前做播客的方式就像是月光族。我的天哪，这完全不可持续。
[00:04:45.130] It's so difficult. There's no like episode bank or anything like that that we can rely on and it would really fuck us over
[00:04:45.130] 这太难了。我们没有剧集库之类的东西可以依靠，这真的会让我们吃尽苦头。
[00:04:50.490] Anytime we needed to travel. Oh, yeah
[00:04:50.490] 任何我们需要出行的时候。哦，是的。
[00:04:52.810] So actually during COVID times it wasn't as bad but the era right before COVID
[00:04:52.810] 所以实际上，新冠疫情期间情况并没有那么糟糕，但新冠疫情爆发前的那段时期情况更糟。
[00:04:58.450] I feel like it was really hard to make sure that episodes were
[00:04:58.450] 我觉得要确保每一集都……真的很难。
[00:05:01.650] Pre-recorded before we went traveling so we're much better about it now, but that was a big challenge for us in the past
[00:05:01.650] 因为我们是在旅行前预先录制的，所以现在我们在这方面做得好多了，但这在过去对我们来说是个很大的挑战。
[00:05:07.650] Oh, yeah, for sure. And I think COVID actually helped us a lot in a sense because before
[00:05:07.650] 哦，当然。而且我认为从某种意义上说，新冠疫情实际上帮了我们很多，因为在此之前……
[00:05:14.290] We always recorded things in person
[00:05:14.290] 我们一直都是亲自记录一切。
[00:05:17.010] And so scheduling was a little harder and we were a little more limited to like people locally
[00:05:17.010] 因此，安排日程稍微困难了一些，而且我们能选择的本地人员也受到更多限制。
[00:05:22.690] And also just like friends people who we would trust to come into our homes, you know
[00:05:22.690] 就像朋友一样，那些我们信任可以到家里来的人，你知道的。
[00:05:28.850] but COVID kind of forced us to start planning ahead more and then also
[00:05:28.850] 但新冠疫情迫使我们开始更多地提前规划，而且也
[00:05:34.050] Find a solution to record remotely
[00:05:34.050] 寻找远程录制的解决方案
[00:05:36.850] Which to this day has helped us a lot because now scheduling is a lot easier because we can be like
[00:05:36.850] 直到今天，这仍然对我们帮助很大，因为现在安排日程容易多了，我们可以像这样：
[00:05:41.570] Yeah, we can record remotely or you know, if you live in the bay
[00:05:41.570] 是的，我们可以远程录音，或者你知道，如果你住在湾区的话。
[00:05:45.570] Then we can figure out a time to record in person if that's a preference
[00:05:45.570] 如果这是您的意愿，我们可以安排时间进行现场录音。
[00:05:51.330] Right. I think we did definitely get all of our scheduling under control during the COVID times
[00:05:51.330] 没错。我认为在新冠疫情期间，我们的所有日程安排都确实井然有序。
[00:05:57.410] Which was good because scheduling was much easier during COVID because people were less busy
[00:05:57.410] 这很好，因为疫情期间人们没那么忙，安排日程就容易多了。
[00:06:02.530] Probably most people weren't traveling and we're just at home
[00:06:02.530] 可能大多数人都没出门旅行，我们都待在家里。
[00:06:05.730] So now that travel is back in full force
[00:06:05.730] 现在旅行已经全面恢复了。
[00:06:08.930] I think we're much better prepared and honestly, I feel like you and I are both people who travel fairly frequently
[00:06:08.930] 我觉得我们准备得更充分了，而且说实话，我觉得你我都是经常旅行的人。
[00:06:15.970] And the trips aren't always short like usually when we travel it's like at least a week or two
[00:06:15.970] 而且这些旅行并不总是像我们通常旅行那样短暂，通常至少要一到两周。
[00:06:20.770] So being prepared in advance has helped so much. Yeah
[00:06:20.770] 所以提前做好准备真的很有帮助。是的。
[00:06:24.210] I think it's also really funny though when we do travel and then we like podcast remotely while we're traveling
[00:06:24.210] 我觉得我们旅行的时候，一边旅行一边远程录制播客也挺有意思的。
[00:06:30.770] Another pro to figuring out the whole remote recording situation
[00:06:30.770] 弄清楚整个远程录制方案的另一个好处
[00:06:34.930] I remember there's definitely been some trips where
[00:06:34.930] 我记得肯定有一些旅行，
[00:06:38.450] I don't know a cabin trip or something or just like a quick weekend trip
[00:06:38.450] 我不知道，比如去小木屋度假什么的，或者只是个短途周末旅行。
[00:06:42.690] Where i'm like, oh, yeah, I can sneak away and record in the morning when everyone's still sleeping
[00:06:42.690] 我当时就想，哦，对啊，我可以趁着早上大家都还在睡觉的时候偷偷溜出去录音。
[00:06:48.530] Dude, actually you're really good about doing podcast recordings while you're traveling
[00:06:48.530] 老兄，你边旅行边录播客真的挺厉害的。
[00:06:52.210] I feel like it's so hard for me. Like I need to be in my podcast space to able to do this podcast
[00:06:52.210] 我觉得这对我来说太难了。好像我需要待在我的播客空间里才能做这个播客。
[00:06:57.250] I think it's because I have a lot of free time when I travel and also sometimes I'm traveling alone
[00:06:57.250] 我想是因为我旅行时有很多空闲时间，而且有时候我是独自旅行。
[00:07:02.290] So it's like way easier to accommodate
[00:07:02.290] 所以这样安排起来就容易多了。
[00:07:05.090] But yeah, definitely if I'm traveling with other people or like maybe to a new place
[00:07:05.090] 不过，如果我和其他人一起旅行，或者去一个陌生的地方，那肯定会的。
[00:07:08.850] Then it's a little harder to like schedule that in or with like a crazy time difference
[00:07:08.850] 这样一来，安排起来就有点困难了，尤其是在时差很大的情况下。
[00:07:13.970] True
[00:07:13.970] 真的
[00:07:14.850] I remember at one point last year when I went to Japan and Korea
[00:07:14.850] 我记得去年有一段时间我去日本和韩国。
[00:07:19.410] And then we were planning our podcasting schedule and I was like, hmm. I guess like worst case
[00:07:19.410] 然后我们在计划播客节目安排的时候，我就想，嗯……我想，最坏的情况是……
[00:07:25.410] I could maybe record out there
[00:07:25.410] 我或许可以在那里录音。
[00:07:29.570] If like, you know morning is evening for us
[00:07:29.570] 如果你知道，对我们来说，早晨就是晚上。
[00:07:32.690] But luckily I think we figured it out and we're like, okay. Thank god
[00:07:32.690] 但幸运的是，我想我们最终解决了这个问题，我们现在觉得，好吧。感谢上帝。
[00:07:35.730] We were able to like slot everything in perfectly
[00:07:35.730] 我们能够完美地把所有东西都安排妥当。
[00:07:38.930] Dude, yeah, I feel like every time you're going on a trip and you're like, oh, it's fine
[00:07:38.930] 兄弟，是啊，我觉得每次你出门旅行的时候，你都会想，哦，没事的。
[00:07:42.530] I can just pack a mic. I'm like crystal no
[00:07:42.530] 我只要带个麦克风就行了。我就像水晶一样，不。
[00:07:46.290] Save your precious vacation time
[00:07:46.290] 节省您宝贵的假期时间
[00:07:49.250] Oh, but going back to our beginning recording chaos
[00:07:49.250] 哦，但回到我们最初录制混乱的时期。
[00:07:54.370] I also just thought of a funny situation which is our very first episode
[00:07:54.370] 我刚刚想到一个很有趣的情景，那就是我们的第一集。
[00:08:00.530] With Tiffany that episode we talked about like friendship and I remember this so specifically because
[00:08:00.530] 那一集我和蒂芙尼聊到了友谊，我对此印象特别深刻，因为……
[00:08:07.730] You know, we're just starting things up
[00:08:07.730] 你知道，我们才刚刚起步。
[00:08:09.810] And then to be was kind enough to be like, yeah, I'm down to record the first episode with you all
[00:08:09.810] 然后他非常友善地表示，好的，我愿意和你们一起录制第一集。
[00:08:15.010] And she was like, so what's the topic?
[00:08:15.010] 她问，所以话题是什么？
[00:08:16.610] And I think we did have the topics like oh, you know friendship
[00:08:16.610] 我觉得我们确实聊到了友谊之类的话题。
[00:08:19.730] And then she's like, okay cool. We just went and then we just winged it like there was no outline
[00:08:19.730] 然后她就说，好，酷。我们就去了，然后就即兴发挥，就像没有任何计划一样。
[00:08:25.730] No idea, I guess no general idea is just like, oh, yeah
[00:08:25.730] 不知道，我猜没有一个大致的想法，大概就是，哦，是的。
[00:08:29.730] We'll talk about friendship like how vague and broad is that
[00:08:29.730] 我们会讨论友谊，比如它究竟有多么模糊和宽泛。
[00:08:33.490] I think we ended up rerecording that one too actually
[00:08:33.490] 我想我们最后也重新录制了那首歌。
[00:08:36.610] Dude, and that was literally at not necessarily a party but like a bigger friend group hang out
[00:08:36.610] 老兄，那其实不算是个派对，但就是一群朋友聚在一起玩而已。
[00:08:41.330] So we were hanging out with a bunch of our other friends
[00:08:41.330] 所以我们就和一群其他朋友一起出去玩。
[00:08:43.730] And then chrystal me and tiffani
[00:08:43.730] 然后是克里斯托尔、我和蒂凡尼
[00:08:45.730] We were like hold up brb for one second and we just like locked ourselves in our room
[00:08:45.730] 我们当时就说，等等，稍等一下，然后我们就把自己锁在房间里了。
[00:08:50.450] And recorded the episode for like 30 40 minutes. Maybe dude. You're so right
[00:08:50.450] 录这集节目大概录了30到40分钟。也许吧，兄弟。你说得太对了。
[00:08:55.250] I actually totally forgot about that and in that original recording
[00:08:55.250] 我竟然完全忘记了这件事，而且在最初的录音中也是如此。
[00:08:59.410] There was like some very slight background sounds of people like I think they're playing 2k in the
[00:08:59.410] 背景里传来一些很轻微的人声，我觉得他们好像在玩2K游戏。
[00:09:05.650] living room
[00:09:05.650] 客厅
[00:09:07.650] Dude, but now despite being way better and way more organized
[00:09:07.650] 兄弟，不过现在虽然我比以前好多了，也更有条理了。
[00:09:13.170] There still are the rare very very rare bliffs
[00:09:13.170] 仍然存在极其罕见的悬崖。
[00:09:18.050] And it actually happened recently which was kind of crazy
[00:09:18.050] 而且这事儿最近真的发生了，真是有点儿不可思议。
[00:09:21.970] But basically we recorded an episode and you know all was really good
[00:09:21.970] 但基本上我们录制了一集，一切都很顺利。
[00:09:27.010] I get on maybe like a week later to edit it
[00:09:27.010] 我大概一周后才上线进行编辑。
[00:09:31.010] I pull it up and i'm like wait
[00:09:31.010] 我把它调出来，然后我说等等
[00:09:33.810] My like me my audio is
[00:09:33.810] 我的音频就像我一样
[00:09:37.410] silent
[00:09:37.410] 沉默的
[00:09:39.170] And I was like, okay. Are my speakers broken? Like what's going on here?
[00:09:39.170] 我当时就想，好吧。我的音箱坏了吗？这是怎么回事？
[00:09:43.010] And i'm like dude reality is setting in and i'm like holy shit. I fucked up
[00:09:43.010] 然后我就想，老兄，现实开始摆在眼前了，我心想，卧槽，我搞砸了。
[00:09:49.810] My audio did not record
[00:09:49.810] 我的音频没有录制成功
[00:09:51.810] And it was such a crazy experience too because i was like, okay
[00:09:51.810] 那真是一段疯狂的经历，因为我当时就想，好吧
[00:09:55.730] I guess like the only solution here is to try and remember exactly what I said
[00:09:55.730] 我想唯一的办法就是努力记住我到底说过什么。
[00:10:00.930] And just listen to you know, what jisoo and our guest was saying
[00:10:00.930] 听听Jisoo和我们的嘉宾是怎么说的吧。
[00:10:04.770] And then I will just try to respond as close to the original wording as I could because they would respond again
[00:10:04.770] 然后我会尽量用接近原文的措辞回复，因为他们还会再次回复。
[00:10:11.650] Right and it can't make like no sense
[00:10:11.650] 对，这完全说不通。
[00:10:14.370] Wow, that was like truly an interesting experience
[00:10:14.370] 哇，那真是一次有趣的经历。
[00:10:17.810] When I got your text when you were like, oh, shit. I have bad news
[00:10:17.810] 当我收到你的短信，内容大概是“哦，糟了，我有个坏消息”的时候
[00:10:21.090] Like my audio didn't record my heart fucking dropped
[00:10:21.090] 就像我的音频没录下来一样，我的心猛地一沉。
[00:10:24.210] But when you sent me the final edit with your newly re-recorded audio and stuff
[00:10:24.210] 但是当你把最终剪辑版，包括你重新录制的音频等等发给我的时候，我才发现……
[00:10:29.090] I was almost like I can't even tell like it's actually so
[00:10:29.090] 我当时几乎都分不清了，真的太……
[00:10:32.770] Good like the way you piece together everything with context clues
[00:10:32.770] 很喜欢你利用上下文线索把所有信息拼凑起来的方式。
[00:10:37.010] And I think the turnover was relatively recent like we had just recorded that episode like fairly recently
[00:10:37.010] 我觉得人员更迭是最近发生的，就像我们不久前才录制了那一集一样。
[00:10:43.570] So at least it was like top of mind. Yeah, but I was like, I don't know how she how she did that like that was crazy
[00:10:43.570] 所以至少这件事我一直记在心里。是啊，但我当时就想，我不知道她是怎么做到的，简直太疯狂了。
[00:10:50.530] Dude, I there were definitely some small chunks where I was like, oh my god
[00:10:50.530] 老兄，确实有那么几个小片段，我当时就想，我的天哪
[00:10:56.050] I actually just don't remember what I said here. So I will have to cut myself out from here
[00:10:56.050] 我其实完全不记得我在这里说过什么了。所以我就此打住吧。
[00:11:03.010] You were silent. Yeah
[00:11:03.010] 你沉默不语。是的。
[00:11:05.890] Indeed, okay one of the hardest parts of that was like, you know
[00:11:05.890] 确实，好吧，其中最难的部分之一就是，你知道的
[00:11:09.570] I listened to the front part and then there's the silence of where I'm supposed to talk
[00:11:09.570] 我听完了前面部分，然后就是我应该说话的那部分一片沉默。
[00:11:13.250] And I listened to the the like response, right? And I'm like, oh my god
[00:11:13.250] 我听了那些点赞的回应，对吧？然后我就想，我的天哪
[00:11:17.410] Why is jisoo and I guess laughing like what did I say?
[00:11:17.410] 为什么我和Jisoo都在笑，好像在问我说了什么？
[00:11:21.330] I'm like, no, what did I say? Like, what is the joke? I don't know
[00:11:21.330] 我当时就想，不对啊，我说了什么？笑点在哪儿？我不知道。
[00:11:25.730] Hey, but you did it pretty good. Like I remember you texted me. Oh god, you're laughing
[00:11:25.730] 嘿，不过你做得挺不错的。我记得你给我发过短信。哦天哪，你在笑。
[00:11:29.810] Like I have no idea what the joke was and then later when I heard the edit
[00:11:29.810] 我一开始完全不知道这个笑点在哪，后来听到剪辑版的时候才明白。
[00:11:33.570] It was the exact joke that you had said. Oh my god. Like it made perfect sense to me and I was like, dude
[00:11:33.570] 就是你说的那个笑话！我的天哪。我当时就觉得，这笑话简直太有道理了，我当时就想，老兄！
[00:11:39.010] That's wild. That's muscle memory right there
[00:11:39.010] 太神奇了。这完全就是肌肉记忆。
[00:11:41.650] Man, but that was a lesson learned now. I'm like, okay, I can never make that mistake again
[00:11:41.650] 唉，不过这次算是吸取教训了。我心想，好吧，我以后再也不能犯同样的错误了。
[00:11:47.250] Like at least on the bright side it was me
[00:11:47.250] 至少往好处想，那是我。
[00:11:50.530] Versus like if it was our guests that would be so bad
[00:11:50.530] 相比之下，如果换成是我们的客人，那就太糟糕了。
[00:11:53.650] If it was like one of us slightly better
[00:11:53.650] 如果它更像我们中的一个，那就更好了
[00:11:56.530] But the first thing that came to my mind was like, oh my god
[00:11:56.530] 但我脑海中浮现的第一个念头是，我的天哪
[00:11:59.410] Do we have to call up our guests and be like, hey, we we need to re-record this entire episode
[00:11:59.410] 难道我们要打电话给嘉宾，告诉他们：“嘿，我们需要重录这期节目。”
[00:12:05.250] I kind of thought that we might but you know, it turned out so seamless
[00:12:05.250] 我原本以为可能会这样，但结果却出乎意料地顺利。
[00:12:09.410] But I'm glad we didn't have to and I think it was also kind of high pressure because
[00:12:09.410] 但我很高兴我们不必那样做，而且我觉得当时压力也挺大的，因为
[00:12:13.890] I was about to leave on a trip too. So this was one of our like backlog episodes
[00:12:13.890] 我也正准备出差。所以这算是我们之前积压的几期节目之一。
[00:12:18.610] Actually, this is something super sweet that chrystal did but since james and I were leaving for a honeymoon
[00:12:18.610] 其实，这是克丽丝托做的一件非常贴心的事，但因为我和詹姆斯要去度蜜月了。
[00:12:23.730] chrystal edited four episodes or something within like one week
[00:12:23.730] Chrystal在一周内剪辑了四集左右。
[00:12:28.290] And made sure that I could do all the editing and whatnot before I left so that I didn't have to do podcast stuff on the
[00:12:28.290] 并且确保我在离开前能完成所有的剪辑和其他工作，这样我就不用在路上做播客相关的工作了。
[00:12:34.130] trip was just super sweet, but this was the last episode we had just recorded and it was like, holy shit like we
[00:12:34.130] 那次旅行真是太棒了，但这是我们刚刚录制的最后一集，感觉就像，我的天哪，我们
[00:12:41.650] We have like 12 hours to get this done
[00:12:41.650] 我们只有大约12个小时来完成这项任务。
[00:12:46.290] Oh my god, but luckily we pulled through
[00:12:46.290] 我的天哪，但幸运的是我们挺过来了。
[00:12:51.330] I wonder if our listeners can guess which episode it is if they can tell not just guess actually if they can tell
[00:12:51.330] 我想知道我们的听众能否猜出这是哪一集，如果他们不只是猜测，而是真的能分辨出来的话。
[00:12:59.410] Hopefully not. Yeah, hopefully not but dms if you think you know, yeah
[00:12:59.410] 希望不是。是啊，希望不是，但如果你觉得你知道，就私信我。
[00:13:04.050] But I think what you mentioned
[00:13:04.050] 但我认为你提到的那些话很有道理。
[00:13:06.050] Kind of reminds me too of one of the things that we had to get used to once we started this podcast was
[00:13:06.050] 这让我想起了我们刚开始做播客时必须适应的一件事：
[00:13:11.490] almost kind of like guest management
[00:13:11.490] 有点像宾客管理
[00:13:13.890] So I think in
[00:13:13.890] 所以我认为
[00:13:15.650] One sense a lot of our guests tend to be our close friends
[00:13:15.650] 从某种意义上说，我们的很多客人都是我们的好朋友。
[00:13:19.330] It's really cool in the way that it's a little bit more casual more comfortable
[00:13:19.330] 它真的很棒，因为它更休闲、更舒适。
[00:13:24.130] You know our communication is just like super informal and like messenger text or something
[00:13:24.130] 你知道，我们的沟通方式非常随意，就像用即时通讯软件发短信之类的。
[00:13:28.530] And it also has the positive impact of like
[00:13:28.530] 它还具有积极的影响，例如
[00:13:31.730] Okay, this recording is basically like a hangout where we can like talk about something
[00:13:31.730] 好的，这个录音基本上就像一个线上聚会，我们可以聊聊天。
[00:13:36.130] But in the other sense whenever we had guests who were external people
[00:13:36.130] 但从另一个角度来说，每当我们有外来客人时……
[00:13:41.250] I felt like we had to kind of get used to communicating with them as well because maybe they have less context into our podcast
[00:13:41.250] 我觉得我们也得慢慢习惯跟他们沟通，因为他们可能不太了解我们的播客。
[00:13:47.970] Maybe they have a different sense of what
[00:13:47.970] 或许他们对“什么”有不同的理解。
[00:13:51.410] They want to talk about or how they want to talk about the topic
[00:13:51.410] 他们想谈论这个话题，或者说他们想如何谈论这个话题。
[00:13:54.530] So then I remember we kind of had to curate like the way we describe our podcast and introduce ourselves
[00:13:54.530] 所以我记得我们当时得好好斟酌一下我们描述播客和自我介绍的方式。
[00:14:01.090] And also kind of like levels that expectations with guests who aren't in our like immediate social network
[00:14:01.090] 而且，这也有点像是在调整那些不在我们直接社交网络中的客人的期望值。
[00:14:06.690] So true. I think the first couple times we were like, what did we say last time again?
[00:14:06.690] 确实如此。我想头几次我们都是这样，心想上次我们说了什么来着？
[00:14:11.570] How do we describe yourselves?
[00:14:11.570] 我们该如何描述自己？
[00:14:13.650] And then eventually we just wrote it down on a doc
[00:14:13.650] 最后我们干脆把它写在了文档上。
[00:14:15.890] We're like, okay, these are the points we have to hit to make sure that you know our guests will understand everything
[00:14:15.890] 我们当时就想，好吧，为了确保我们的客人能够理解所有内容，我们必须做到以下几点。
[00:14:21.810] I think things got a lot smoother from there
[00:14:21.810] 我觉得事情从那以后就顺利多了。
[00:14:24.530] And I think it also makes us really try extra hard on our outlines
[00:14:24.530] 而且我认为这也会促使我们更加努力地完善大纲。
[00:14:29.090] So for context before an episode we always
[00:14:29.090] 所以，在观看剧集之前，我们总是会提供一些背景信息。
[00:14:32.450] Write out some sort of guideline so that we know in general like what sub topics
[00:14:32.450] 写一份指导方针，以便我们大致了解有哪些子主题。
[00:14:39.250] Part of the bigger topic that we're going to talk about and you know, if people want feel more comfortable writing notes
[00:14:39.250] 这是我们接下来要讨论的一个更大话题的一部分，而且，你知道，如果人们想更自在地写笔记的话。
[00:14:44.930] Then they're welcome to do that
[00:14:44.930] 那么，他们当然可以这样做。
[00:14:46.930] And I think in general it has made people feel more prepared
[00:14:46.930] 而且我认为，总体而言，这让人们感到准备得更充分了。
[00:14:50.690] When they feel more prepared, they're more comfortable on the podcast too. So it you know, it just it just improves the flow overall
[00:14:50.690] 当他们感觉准备更充分时，他们在播客录制过程中也会更自在。所以你知道，这自然会提升整体的流畅度。
[00:14:57.650] And I think it's always just such a nice thing to hear when we get external guests and they're like, oh, this is like a really good outline
[00:14:57.650] 我觉得，每当有外部嘉宾说“哦，这真是一个非常好的提纲”时，听到这些话总是让人非常高兴。
[00:15:06.850] I know there's actually no bigger compliment and
[00:15:06.850] 我知道这其实是最高的赞美了。
[00:15:10.130] In the beginning we definitely did not hear these comments
[00:15:10.130] 起初我们绝对没有听到这些评论。
[00:15:13.090] But more so recently I feel like people often say like the way you guys do your logistical details
[00:15:13.090] 但最近我感觉人们经常会说，你们处理后勤细节的方式很棒。
[00:15:19.250] Or like walk us through the outline and you know have these conversations about topic ideas is like
[00:15:19.250] 或者像带我们梳理一下提纲，然后跟我们讨论一下选题思路之类的。
[00:15:24.370] Professional so that I'm just like holy fuck. This is major growth from the days where we would just jump scare our guests
[00:15:24.370] 专业程度简直让我惊叹不已。这跟我们以前只会吓唬客人相比，进步太大了。
[00:15:32.610] We're like, oh shit. We're professionals now like yeah
[00:15:32.610] 我们当时就想，卧槽。我们现在是专业人士了，没错。
[00:15:35.810] We have a whole routine
[00:15:35.810] 我们有一套完整的流程。
[00:15:38.610] We've got like a whole process for everything
[00:15:38.610] 我们有一套完整的流程来处理所有事情。
[00:15:42.050] I think also at the same time it makes us feel better
[00:15:42.050] 我觉得与此同时，它也能让我们感觉更好。
[00:15:45.170] If we know that we've done everything that we need to
[00:15:45.170] 如果我们知道我们已经完成了所有需要做的事情
[00:15:48.050] And you know all of our boxes are checked then all that's left is to just focus on the recording and the topic at hand
[00:15:48.050] 如果一切准备就绪，那么剩下的就是专注于录音和主题本身了。
[00:15:54.770] Yeah, definitely low key sometimes it kind of makes me laugh because I feel like we have this
[00:15:54.770] 是的，有时候低调一点儿也会让我觉得好笑，因为我觉得我们之间有这种感觉。
[00:16:00.690] Rhythm that we get into when we you know meet an external guest for the first time and do our like preliminary chat with them
[00:16:00.690] 当我们第一次见到外部来宾并与他们进行初步交谈时，我们就会进入一种特定的节奏。
[00:16:07.330] Like you said we kind of have like almost like a sop or like some sort of documentation on what we should talk about
[00:16:07.330] 就像你说的，我们基本上有一套标准操作程序或者某种文件，规定了我们应该讨论的内容。
[00:16:12.370] At this point it's like memorized and I feel like it's almost like an unofficial script of
[00:16:12.370] 现在我已经把台词背下来了，感觉就像是一份非正式的剧本。
[00:16:16.610] Oh, you'll walk through this part and then I walk through this section or blah blah
[00:16:16.610] 哦，你走完这部分，然后我走完这部分，或者等等等等。
[00:16:20.930] Sometimes we like swap and I feel like it kind of throws us off or something and that always makes me laugh because I'm just like
[00:16:20.930] 有时候我们喜欢互换角色，我觉得这会让我们有点不知所措，这总是让我觉得好笑，因为我当时就觉得……
[00:16:27.170] Damn, it's such small subtle things that only we would know because we've been doing this for five years
[00:16:27.170] 该死，这些都是只有我们才知道的细微之处，因为我们已经做了五年了。
[00:16:32.930] But I don't know just like cool like behind the scenes details about like who owns which lines of like our intro doc, you know
[00:16:32.930] 但我不知道一些幕后细节，比如我们介绍纪录片里哪些台词的版权归属，你知道的。
[00:16:39.890] Yeah
[00:16:39.890] 是的
[00:16:41.570] Oh man as we talk over this. I'm just like wow
[00:16:41.570] 哦，天哪，我们聊到这个的时候，我简直惊呆了。
[00:16:45.090] We've come so far
[00:16:45.090] 我们已经走了很远
[00:16:48.130] We have
[00:16:48.130] 我们有
[00:16:49.410] Yeah, and sometimes I feel like our friends ask us they're like, oh, how's the podcast going?
[00:16:49.410] 是啊，有时候我觉得我们的朋友会问我们，比如，“播客进展如何？”
[00:16:54.210] I'm like, yeah, you know, it's still like it's good. It's going
[00:16:54.210] 我心想，是啊，你知道，感觉还是挺好的。一切都在进行中。
[00:16:57.570] I guess because like now that everything is
[00:16:57.570] 我想是因为现在一切都……
[00:17:00.530] pretty organized and like you said we
[00:17:00.530] 组织得相当好，就像你说的，我们
[00:17:04.290] Just kind of have a rhythm for things
[00:17:04.290] 做事就得有点节奏感。
[00:17:06.610] It like takes up less brain space in terms of you know that more like
[00:17:06.610] 它占用的脑力空间更少，你知道，就像这样
[00:17:11.650] organization and like
[00:17:11.650] 组织和类似
[00:17:13.170] Planning side. So I guess when we really sit down and talk about it. I'm like, oh, shit
[00:17:13.170] 计划方面。所以我想，当我们真正坐下来讨论这件事的时候，我就会想，哦，糟了。
[00:17:17.410] Yeah, we actually plan and organize a lot like we kind of do a lot
[00:17:17.410] 是的，我们其实经常会做很多计划和组织工作。
[00:17:21.970] And I actually helped so much because like you said it's less mental space because we prepare beforehand
[00:17:21.970] 而且我确实帮了大忙，因为就像你说的，我们提前做好准备，这样就节省了很多精力。
[00:17:27.810] And then I feel like also it's less
[00:17:27.810] 然后我觉得它也更少了。
[00:17:29.970] Anxiety inducing like we have less of those moments where we're like, oh, shit
[00:17:29.970] 令人焦虑的是，我们越来越少有那种“哦，糟了”的时刻了。
[00:17:32.930] We need to scramble for a guest for sure
[00:17:32.930] 我们肯定需要赶紧找个客人。
[00:17:35.090] I think one of the things that I feel like has helped us a lot in the last five years is
[00:17:35.090] 我认为过去五年里对我们帮助最大的事情之一是
[00:17:40.050] For some reason we just don't run out of like stuff to talk about and I think that's like one of the most common questions
[00:17:40.050] 不知为何，我们总有聊不完的话题，我觉得这算是最常见的问题之一了。
[00:17:46.050] My friends will ask me they're like, how do you guys?
[00:17:46.050] 我的朋友会问我，他们会说，你们是怎么做到的？
[00:17:48.370] You know keep a podcast going for five years
[00:17:48.370] 你知道，让播客持续五年是怎样的？
[00:17:50.850] Like don't you run out of things to say and I'm just like I feel like there's so many
[00:17:50.850] 就好像你不会没话可说似的，而我却觉得有很多话想说。
[00:17:54.930] Minute details that we go through in our lives that we like find interesting or funny
[00:17:54.930] 生活中我们经历的那些细枝末节，我们觉得有趣或好笑。
[00:18:00.530] And it's like something that you and I would totally text about
[00:18:00.530] 这就像你我会在短信里聊的那种话题。
[00:18:03.330] And then we just draw all that shit down on like an idea board and that's like our podcast
[00:18:03.330] 然后我们就把所有这些东西都画在类似创意板上，那就像我们的播客一样。
[00:18:08.850] Yeah, like sometimes it's just what's top of mind. We're obsessed with this current thing. Let's you know talk about it
[00:18:08.850] 是啊，有时候就是脑子里最先想到的事。我们现在对这事儿特别着迷，所以就聊聊这个吧。
[00:18:15.490] Yeah, but I agree
[00:18:15.490] 是的，但我同意
[00:18:16.770] I get that question a lot and I don't even know how to answer it. I'm just like, oh, I don't know. I guess we just haven't
[00:18:16.770] 我经常被问到这个问题，但我甚至不知道该怎么回答。我只能说，哦，我不知道。我想我们只是还没有……
[00:18:22.930] Like we just haven't run out of things yet
[00:18:22.930] 就好像我们还没用完所有东西似的。
[00:18:26.370] Professional yappers
[00:18:26.370] 职业话痨
[00:18:29.810] This is our safe space to yapp about whatever we want
[00:18:29.810] 这是我们畅所欲言的安全空间，想说什么就说什么。
[00:18:33.570] And then we drag our friends into it too. We're like, hey, do you want to talk about such and such?
[00:18:33.570] 然后我们还会把朋友们也拉进来。我们会说，嘿，你们想聊聊这个那个的话题吗？
[00:18:40.370] They're like, um, okay. I guess so
[00:18:40.370] 他们好像是，嗯，好吧。我想是的。
[00:18:42.530] Dude, but it's really nice honestly
[00:18:42.530] 老兄，说真的，这地方真不错。
[00:18:44.210] And I feel like we're very lucky to have a group of friends who are one willing to help us and participate in this project with us
[00:18:44.210] 我觉得我们非常幸运，有一群朋友愿意帮助我们，并与我们一起参与这个项目。
[00:18:51.410] But two just our friends have interesting stuff to say and they have interesting experiences to talk about and
[00:18:51.410] 但是，我们两位朋友却有很多有趣的事情要说，他们也有很多有趣的经历可以分享。
[00:18:57.490] Even beyond our friends like people
[00:18:57.490] 甚至超越了我们像朋友一样的人
[00:19:00.450] We have guessed it in the past just have
[00:19:00.450] 我们过去也曾猜测过，只是……
[00:19:02.930] All of this information and like experiences that maybe you and I don't have and I just I'm always like fascinated when we do an episode
[00:19:02.930] 所有这些信息和经历，或许是你我没有的，每次我们录制节目的时候，我都会觉得很着迷。
[00:19:10.930] Where I'm like people think so differently from me and also they have such different lived experiences and lives from me
[00:19:10.930] 我觉得我所在的地方，人们的想法和我截然不同，他们的生活经历和人生轨迹也和我大相径庭。
[00:19:18.050] So then I feel like it feels a lot more fulfilling and interesting
[00:19:18.050] 所以我觉得这样更有意义，也更有趣。
[00:19:21.650] Oh my god, for sure. And I think to your point about you know chatting with our friends
[00:19:21.650] 我的天哪，当然。而且我觉得你说的和朋友聊天这点也很有道理。
[00:19:27.250] There's definitely a lot of things that come up on the podcast that
[00:19:27.250] 播客里确实有很多话题被提及，
[00:19:31.330] We would have never even known about our friends if we didn't you know, choose to talk about this certain topic with them
[00:19:31.330] 如果我们不主动和朋友们谈论这个话题，我们可能永远都不会知道他们的存在。
[00:19:37.890] I mean, I can't think of one off the top of my head right now
[00:19:37.890] 我的意思是，我现在一时想不出一个合适的例子。
[00:19:40.690] But you know, it's just like the fact that we're like putting aside
[00:19:40.690] 但你知道，这就好比我们把这件事搁置一边一样。
[00:19:45.090] couple hours each weekend to kind of deep dive on
[00:19:45.090] 每个周末花几个小时深入研究……
[00:19:49.330] Some random or maybe top-of-mind topic with one of our friends usually
[00:19:49.330] 通常我们会和某个朋友聊一些随机的或者突然想到的话题。
[00:19:54.370] We just you know hear stories that we normally wouldn't and usually it's it's just like really
[00:19:54.370] 我们有时会听到一些平时不会听到的故事，通常情况下，这真的让人难以置信。
[00:19:59.890] Eye-opening I think because sometimes our topics
[00:19:59.890] 我觉得这很发人深省，因为我们有时讨论的话题
[00:20:03.570] Especially lately have been like, oh my god, like we're we're getting older. Like what are we doing with our lives?
[00:20:03.570] 尤其是最近，我常常会想，天哪，我们真的老了。我们的人生到底在干什么？
[00:20:09.810] And then it's like, oh shoot everyone else is going through this too
[00:20:09.810] 然后就会想，哎呀，原来其他人也都经历着同样的事情。
[00:20:12.770] But you know, maybe we don't talk about that as much in our day to day hangouts
[00:20:12.770] 但你知道，也许我们在日常聚会中不太会谈论这些。
[00:20:17.010] And so it's just nice to be like, okay cool. You are also experiencing some crazy shit like us
[00:20:17.010] 所以，能这样想就挺好的，就像，好吧，酷。你们也和我们一样，经历着一些疯狂的事情。
[00:20:23.090] Or not crazy damn. That's like a really good point actually
[00:20:23.090] 或者说，这根本不算什么疯狂的想法。这确实是一个很好的观点。
[00:20:26.690] I don't know what it is necessarily about the podcast
[00:20:26.690] 我不太清楚播客到底有什么特别之处。
[00:20:30.050] Space that makes it easier to open up about stuff like that
[00:20:30.050] 这样的空间让人更容易敞开心扉谈论这类事情。
[00:20:33.010] But it does seem like it puts us all into a mindset of wanting to have deep conversations and like talk about our feelings and open up
[00:20:33.010] 但这似乎确实让我们都想进行深入的对话，谈论我们的感受，敞开心扉。
[00:20:40.450] And to be honest, it's also not easy right to like share all of these different private details about your life
[00:20:40.450] 说实话，要分享所有这些关于你生活的私人细节也并不容易。
[00:20:47.090] And about your emotions things that might in the normal social space make you feel super vulnerable
[00:20:47.090] 关于你的情绪，有些事情在正常的社交场合可能会让你感到非常脆弱。
[00:20:53.170] So, you know, we're definitely blessed to also have these people
[00:20:53.170] 所以，你知道，我们能拥有这些人，绝对是件非常幸运的事。
[00:20:56.930] Who are gracious enough to like really dive deep into things like this when I think the instinct is to kind of hide it away
[00:20:56.930] 有些人非常友善，愿意深入探讨这类事情，而我觉得人们的本能反应是把这些事情藏起来。
[00:21:03.650] Yeah, true
[00:21:03.650] 是的，没错
[00:21:05.010] I guess essentially a lot of our podcast is
[00:21:05.010] 我想，我们播客的大部分内容基本上都是
[00:21:07.890] You know sharing stories with each other and I think this is a value that we've talked about
[00:21:07.890] 你知道，彼此分享故事，我认为这是我们一直讨论过的一种价值观。
[00:21:13.250] Behind the scenes a lot too, which is relating with each other
[00:21:13.250] 幕后也有很多事情需要处理，比如彼此之间的沟通。
[00:21:16.850] you know finding that point of
[00:21:16.850] 你知道，找到那个点
[00:21:18.690] Relateability and luckily I think a lot of our listeners also are able to relate to this
[00:21:18.690] 共鸣性，幸运的是，我认为我们的很多听众也能感同身受。
[00:21:24.610] And I think it kind of just makes everyone feel a little less alone in certain experiences
[00:21:24.610] 我觉得这能让每个人在某些经历中感到不那么孤单。
[00:21:30.770] Yeah, I think that's very true
[00:21:30.770] 是的，我觉得这很有道理。
[00:21:32.210] And I think that is also one of the joys of trying to come up with or like dive deep into certain topics
[00:21:32.210] 我认为这也是尝试提出或深入研究某些主题的乐趣之一。
[00:21:39.490] We really try to go for things that match up with our core values and what we believe our podcast represents
[00:21:39.490] 我们努力选择与我们的核心价值观以及我们认为播客所代表的意义相符的事物。
[00:21:45.890] But also things that we feel like our listeners might relate to or oftentimes
[00:21:45.890] 但也包括我们觉得听众可能会产生共鸣的事情，或者经常
[00:21:50.210] Episode ideas that listeners even DM us to discuss
[00:21:50.210] 听众甚至会私信我们讨论一些节目创意。
[00:21:53.890] You know as much as it's a personal project between you and me
[00:21:53.890] 你知道，这就像是你和我之间的一个私人项目一样。
[00:21:57.570] I feel like it also includes heavily like our friends and it also includes heavily our listeners as well for sure
[00:21:57.570] 我觉得它也很大程度上包含了我们的朋友，当然也很大程度上包含了我们的听众。
[00:22:04.930] I think it's like very rewarding too
[00:22:04.930] 我觉得这也很有意义。
[00:22:07.490] It really does feel like we deepen our connection with our friends in some sense and
[00:22:07.490] 确实感觉我们在某种程度上加深了与朋友之间的联系，
[00:22:14.130] You know learn a lot from the more external guests and it's very nice to
[00:22:14.130] 你知道，从外部嘉宾身上能学到很多东西，这非常好。
[00:22:20.690] hear that
[00:22:20.690] 听到了
[00:22:21.890] Our listeners have been enjoying it and that they can relate to
[00:22:21.890] 我们的听众都很喜欢这个节目，而且他们也感同身受。
[00:22:25.970] It provides like I guess a little bit of like a sense of community
[00:22:25.970] 它给人一种社区归属感的感觉。
[00:22:30.770] Yeah, true
[00:22:30.770] 是的，没错
[00:22:31.970] And also one of the I think unspoken joys about our episode planning and like topic selections
[00:22:31.970] 这也是我认为我们在节目策划和选题方面一个难以言说的乐趣所在。
[00:22:38.610] Is I find it really fun to come up with a topic
[00:22:38.610] 我觉得想出一个话题真的很有趣
[00:22:41.570] And then like map it to a close friend who we feel like would be the perfect guest for that topic
[00:22:41.570] 然后，我们可以把它和一位亲密的朋友联系起来，觉得他/她会是讨论这个话题的最佳人选。
[00:22:46.450] Yes, I feel like it's almost something that requires a lot of thought but at the same time. It's very just instinctive
[00:22:46.450] 是的，我觉得这几乎需要深思熟虑，但同时，它也是一种非常本能的行为。
[00:22:52.850] It's like I know this person would be a good fit and like I don't have to necessarily articulate it because you also get the vibes as well
[00:22:52.850] 就好像我知道这个人很适合我，而且我不需要特意说出来，因为你也能感受到那种感觉。
[00:22:59.170] So I feel like that exercise is always like a hidden joy of our weekly meetings. Oh my god
[00:22:59.170] 所以我觉得，每次开会做这个练习都是我们隐藏的乐趣之一。我的天哪
[00:23:04.370] Good point. I think that's another question we get a lot from our friends
[00:23:04.370] 说得对。我觉得这也是我们朋友经常问我们的一个问题。
[00:23:08.450] Like, oh, how do you choose the topic? How do you choose the guest because I'm sure from their perspective
[00:23:08.450] 比如，哦，你怎么选择话题？你怎么选择嘉宾？因为我肯定是从他们的角度来看的。
[00:23:14.210] It's like a little random, right? It's like crystal and jiso asked me to be on the pod
[00:23:14.210] 感觉有点突然，对吧？就像是Crystal和Jiso邀请我上播客节目一样。
[00:23:18.610] I wonder why they chose this topic or I wonder why they chose me
[00:23:18.610] 我很好奇他们为什么选择这个主题，或者说，我很好奇他们为什么选择我。
[00:23:21.890] It's basically what you said we usually either curate a topic and then we're like
[00:23:21.890] 基本上就像你说的，我们通常会先选定一个主题，然后我们就会……
[00:23:26.770] Oh, who would be good for this topic or we know that we want one of our friends on
[00:23:26.770] 哦，谁适合这个话题呢？或者我们知道我们想让我们的一个朋友来。
[00:23:32.370] And we'll be like, oh, what is like a good topic for this friend
[00:23:32.370] 然后我们就会想，哦，跟这位朋友聊什么话题比较好呢？
[00:23:35.890] Yeah, the reverse part is very fun too. I feel like it
[00:23:35.890] 是的，倒叙部分也很有趣。我觉得是这样。
[00:23:41.490] Requires you to know your friend very well in some senses and then it also can be like an opportunity to learn more about them through that specific topic too
[00:23:41.490] 从某种意义上说，这要求你非常了解你的朋友；同时，这也提供了一个通过特定话题更多了解他们的机会。
[00:23:50.690] Like not necessarily like oh, I'm gonna have this friend on for this topic because he or she is an expert
[00:23:50.690] 不一定非得是那种“哦，我要请这位朋友来谈谈这个话题，因为他/她是专家”的情况。
[00:23:56.290] Sometimes they just fit the vibe of like what we want to go for for that episode if it's like playful or funny or deep and sensitive
[00:23:56.290] 有时候，它们恰好符合我们想要营造的那集氛围，无论是轻松搞笑，还是深刻感人。
[00:24:03.570] So there's just like a lot of vibe matching
[00:24:03.570] 所以，这里面有很多感觉上的契合之处。
[00:24:07.090] That happens behind the scenes
[00:24:07.090] 这一切都发生在幕后。
[00:24:09.250] I will admit though some of it is learned through experience
[00:24:09.250] 不过我承认，有些东西是通过经验学到的。
[00:24:13.410] I think you know back in the beginning of the pod
[00:24:13.410] 我想你应该记得播客刚开始的时候。
[00:24:16.610] No matter what people are going to be a little different in front of the microphone versus, you know out there in the world
[00:24:16.610] 无论如何，人们在麦克风前的表现和在现实世界中的表现总会有所不同。
[00:24:23.010] We definitely did I don't know. I guess like internal calibration to match, you know
[00:24:23.010] 我们肯定做了，我也不知道。我猜可能是内部校准来匹配之类的，你知道的。
[00:24:28.210] Someone's on mic personality with the topics and there have definitely been a lot of like pleasant surprises too
[00:24:28.210] 主持人对话题很有个人魅力，而且确实有很多令人惊喜的内容。
[00:24:35.970] Maybe someone who we
[00:24:35.970] 或许是我们认识的某个人
[00:24:38.050] anticipated to be
[00:24:38.050] 预计是
[00:24:39.410] A little more quiet or reserved ended up being like a superstar on the mic or even someone who's normally
[00:24:39.410] 原本比较安静或内敛的人，最终却在麦克风前表现得像个超级巨星，甚至连平时比较内向的人也一样。
[00:24:46.210] More silly ends up being like much more
[00:24:46.210] 更愚蠢的事情最终会变成更多的事情
[00:24:50.450] Profound, you know for some reason give them a mic and they become like hey welcome to my TED talk
[00:24:50.450] 真是深刻啊，你知道吗，不知为何，给他们一个麦克风，他们就好像变成了“嘿，欢迎来到我的TED演讲”。
[00:24:58.530] So I I'm just thinking of like some of our happy accidents is sometimes when we pair people up
[00:24:58.530] 所以，我只是在想，我们的一些幸运意外有时就是当我们把人配对的时候……
[00:25:04.610] So for our four person episodes one of the episodes that we continuously find to be super funny
[00:25:04.610] 所以，在我们四人剧集中，有一集我们一直觉得超级搞笑。
[00:25:11.890] Is like that one with jimmy and I where we talked about
[00:25:11.890] 就像我和吉米聊的那次一样……
[00:25:16.130] DTR defining the relationship. I think that was a covid episode too
[00:25:16.130] DTR（确定关系）指的是确定恋爱关系。我觉得那也是新冠疫情期间发生的一件事。
[00:25:20.770] We were like, oh these two know each other
[00:25:20.770] 我们当时就想，哦，这两个人认识啊。
[00:25:23.010] We're all part of like bigger friend group
[00:25:23.010] 我们都是某个更大朋友群体的一份子。
[00:25:25.330] Let's just try it out put them together and see how the episode goes and we were like, oh my god
[00:25:25.330] 咱们就试试看，把它们放在一起，看看这集效果怎么样，结果我们当时就想，我的天哪
[00:25:29.810] Wait, that was like amazing perfect chemistry awesome
[00:25:29.810] 等等，那简直是绝妙的完美化学反应，太棒了！
[00:25:34.370] That one was so funny. Honestly
[00:25:34.370] 那段真的太搞笑了。说真的。
[00:25:37.170] I would highly recommend anyone to go back and listen to that episode because we literally made them act out break ups with each other
[00:25:37.170] 我强烈建议大家回去听听那一集，因为我们真的让他们互相表演了分手场景。
[00:25:45.090] I feel like another type of episode that I also enjoy recording a lot is our girl talk episodes
[00:25:45.090] 我觉得我也很喜欢录制另一种类型的节目，那就是我们的女生聊天节目。
[00:25:51.410] There's just so much about it that brings me joy like one recording with girlfriends always such a pleasure
[00:25:51.410] 这件事有很多让我感到快乐的地方，比如和闺蜜们一起录音总是那么令人愉快。
[00:25:56.850] Sometimes during girl talk episodes
[00:25:56.850] 有时在女生聊天节目中
[00:25:58.370] we do mix people from like different friend groups or different walks of life and
[00:25:58.370] 我们确实会将来自不同朋友圈或不同生活背景的人混合在一起，
[00:26:02.930] You know anytime we've done something like that
[00:26:02.930] 你知道，每当我们做类似的事情时
[00:26:04.850] It always ends up with like an amazing episode where people just
[00:26:04.850] 总是会以一集精彩的剧集结尾，人们会……
[00:26:08.690] Relate to each other in our womanhood and our femininity and just what we experience as women
[00:26:08.690] 在女性身份、女性气质以及我们作为女性的经历中，彼此建立联系。
[00:26:14.050] But it's also just fun like especially our four person girl talk episodes
[00:26:14.050] 但也很有趣，尤其是我们四个女生一起聊天的那些节目。
[00:26:17.810] Everyone chimes in everyone has an opinion and I feel like it's always like a fun and fast paced episode
[00:26:17.810] 每个人都积极发言，每个人都有自己的看法，我觉得每一集都很有趣，节奏也很快。
[00:26:23.170] So most recently we did one with jane and cindy talking about
[00:26:23.170] 所以最近我们做了一期节目，简和辛迪谈论了……
[00:26:27.730] Situationships and that was also a really fun and memorable one for me
[00:26:27.730] 暧昧关系，那对我来说也是一段非常有趣且难忘的经历。
[00:26:31.410] I think it's also cool that we've like I guess unintentionally or intentionally
[00:26:31.410] 我觉得很酷的一点是，我们好像无意中或有意地……
[00:26:36.690] Mixed friend groups of it through the pod
[00:26:36.690] 通过这个小圈子，不同的朋友群体聚集在一起。
[00:26:39.490] I think also it's cool because other people
[00:26:39.490] 我觉得这也很酷，因为其他人
[00:26:42.530] Maybe know of our other friends because of a podcast episode
[00:26:42.530] 或许是因为一期播客节目，你才认识了我们的其他朋友。
[00:26:46.690] I'm like, oh, yeah, I do know that friend that random friend that you mentioned because I heard their episode or something of that sort
[00:26:46.690] 我当时就想，哦，对啊，我确实认识你提到的那个朋友，就是那个不知名的朋友，因为我听过他们那期节目之类的。
[00:26:53.650] Which I always think is like very interesting and funny
[00:26:53.650] 我一直觉得这很有趣，也很搞笑。
[00:26:57.490] I know I I feel like at our bachelorette party
[00:26:57.490] 我知道我感觉就像在我们的单身派对上一样
[00:27:01.330] Even if people hadn't met each other like they were familiar with each other's episodes
[00:27:01.330] 即使人们之前并不认识，但他们对彼此的经历却很熟悉。
[00:27:05.970] And stuff like that and I was like this is such a cool and like
[00:27:05.970] 诸如此类的事情，我就觉得这太酷了，然后……
[00:27:08.690] unintentional side effect of having a podcast like this where we feature our friends
[00:27:08.690] 制作像这样的播客节目，邀请朋友们参与，这带来了一个意想不到的副作用：我们邀请了朋友们来做嘉宾。
[00:27:13.090] It's like it does give a sort of bonding experience
[00:27:13.090] 它似乎确实能带来某种情感上的联结。
[00:27:16.210] Like maybe you haven't listened to this person's episode necessarily but you've both been guests on the podcast
[00:27:16.210] 或许你没听过这个人的那期节目，但你们俩都上过这个播客节目。
[00:27:21.170] So in that way you already have like a shared experience to talk about. Yeah
[00:27:21.170] 这样一来，你们就有了共同的经历可以聊。是的。
[00:27:25.010] Oh my god
[00:27:25.010] 我的天啊
[00:27:25.810] There was a funny moment at your batch weekend when someone was like, all right
[00:27:25.810] 你们班周末聚会的时候发生了一件挺搞笑的事，当时有人说，好吧
[00:27:30.530] Everyone introduce yourselves and name your favorite episode of
[00:27:30.530] 大家自我介绍一下，并说说自己最喜欢的一集《》
[00:27:33.970] Eater crust and I feel like everyone said the one that they were featured on
[00:27:33.970] Eater Crust，我觉得大家都说了他们被推荐的那家。
[00:27:41.410] So funny
[00:27:41.410] 太搞笑了
[00:27:42.610] And I think along the veins of mixing friend groups
[00:27:42.610] 我认为，将朋友群体混合在一起也是个不错的选择。
[00:27:45.890] I feel like I have essentially met almost all of your friends
[00:27:45.890] 我觉得我基本上已经见过你所有的朋友们了。
[00:27:49.250] So here this podcast and vice versa for you as well
[00:27:49.250] 所以，这里是这个播客，反之亦然。
[00:27:52.770] So then I think it gives me a lot of context on like you and your friendships to just on like a personal level
[00:27:52.770] 所以我觉得这让我对你以及你的友谊，从个人层面上，有了更深入的了解。
[00:27:58.610] And I find it really cool actually because it's a very rare and like specific
[00:27:58.610] 我觉得这真的很酷，因为它非常罕见，而且很特别。
[00:28:03.330] Experience to be able to do that like meet all of your friends closest friends
[00:28:03.330] 能够做到这一点，就像见到你所有最亲密的朋友一样。
[00:28:07.490] So in that way, I am grateful for this podcast and like just seeing your dynamics with all your friends is very fascinating
[00:28:07.490] 所以从这个意义上说，我很感激这个播客，而且看到你和所有朋友之间的互动也很有趣。
[00:28:13.570] Oh my god
[00:28:13.570] 我的天啊
[00:28:14.210] Wait, that's such a good point because at your wedding. I remember I was like wait
[00:28:14.210] 等等，你说的太对了，因为在你的婚礼上，我记得我当时就想，等等
[00:28:18.850] I low-key know everyone here because
[00:28:18.850] 我其实认识这里所有人，因为
[00:28:21.650] Because of the podcast
[00:28:21.650] 因为播客
[00:28:23.970] Actually
[00:28:23.970] 实际上
[00:28:25.810] I guess you'll have a similar experience in the future
[00:28:25.810] 我想你将来也会有类似的经历。
[00:28:28.930] Yes, exactly
[00:28:28.930] 是的，没错。
[00:28:31.170] I think it's also funny because like if there is maybe someone who
[00:28:31.170] 我觉得这也挺搞笑的，因为就像如果有个人……
[00:28:35.890] You didn't meet or I didn't meet that they still know of you
[00:28:35.890] 你我都没见过面，所以他们才不知道你是谁。
[00:28:40.610] Or me I guess because they're like, oh, aren't you like the person who does the podcast with jisoo or something like that
[00:28:40.610] 或者可能是我，因为他们会说，哦，你是不是跟Jisoo一起做播客的那个人之类的？
[00:28:47.010] It's so funny too because it's almost like, you know how you introduce say a significant other, right?
[00:28:47.010] 这真的太搞笑了，因为这就像，你知道你是怎么介绍你的另一半的，对吧？
[00:28:52.930] It's like, oh, you know this person is like very attached to my life
[00:28:52.930] 感觉就像，哦，你知道，这个人对我的生活影响很大。
[00:28:56.450] Blah blah it's like someone for friends to like really know and then it's almost like you're at that level too because it's like
[00:28:56.450] 巴拉巴拉，就像是朋友们真正了解的人，然后你感觉自己也达到了那个层次，因为就像
[00:29:03.730] It's like, yeah
[00:29:03.730] 就像，是的
[00:29:04.930] I almost expect people to know or have an inkling of who you are because this podcast and like being so embedded in my life
[00:29:04.930] 我几乎觉得大家都会认识你，或者至少对你有所了解，因为这个播客已经深深融入了我的生活。
[00:29:14.210] Dude, I know exactly what you mean
[00:29:14.210] 兄弟，我完全明白你的意思。
[00:29:16.370] Usually when you talk about your friend or you like you mentioned
[00:29:16.370] 通常当你谈到你的朋友或者像你提到的那样谈到你自己时，你会提到这一点。
[00:29:18.850] Oh, I went to dinner with this person or whatever to someone who doesn't know that person
[00:29:18.850] 哦，我跟这个人一起吃了顿饭之类的，而这个人根本不认识这个人。
[00:29:22.050] You're like, I went with my friend chrystal, but I feel like it doesn't need that like intro anymore
[00:29:22.050] 你会说，我和朋友克里斯托一起去的，但我觉得没必要再做那样的介绍了。
[00:29:27.570] I'm just like, oh, I went with chrystal even to people who don't know you and 99% of the time they like they're like, oh, yeah
[00:29:27.570] 我就会说，哦，我和 Chrystal 一起去了，即使是对不认识你的人，99% 的情况下他们都会说，哦，是啊。
[00:29:32.770] You're like podcast
[00:29:32.770] 你就像个播客
[00:29:34.770] I'm like, yeah
[00:29:34.770] 我心想，是啊
[00:29:36.850] It's so funny. I'm like damn jisoo is basically like my podcast significant other
[00:29:36.850] 太搞笑了。我感觉Jisoo简直就是我的播客搭档。
[00:29:43.890] The word of five-year-long relationship
[00:29:43.890] 长达五年的恋爱关系
[00:29:46.290] But also speaking of like, you know knowing about this podcast and our friendships and stuff
[00:29:46.290] 但说到这个播客，还有我们的友谊等等，你知道的。
[00:29:52.530] I always think it's so funny when
[00:29:52.530] 我总是觉得这很搞笑，当
[00:29:55.490] When I see a friend and they're like, it's so nice to catch up. I'm so sorry
[00:29:55.490] 当我见到朋友，他们说，能和他们叙叙旧真好。我很抱歉。
[00:30:00.130] I haven't listened to your podcast in a while
[00:30:00.130] 我好久没听你的播客了。
[00:30:02.850] And I'm like, dude, it's totally fine
[00:30:02.850] 我当时就想，老兄，完全没问题。
[00:30:04.930] I don't even like it's not an issue if you don't listen or if you listen
[00:30:04.930] 我甚至不喜欢，不管你听不听，这都不是问题。
[00:30:08.770] But I think it's so funny when they're like, oh my god. I'm so sorry like I haven't listened to anything recently
[00:30:08.770] 但我认为他们那种“我的天哪，真抱歉，我最近什么都没听过”的反应特别搞笑。
[00:30:14.210] Wait, yeah, I've had so many conversations like that with my friends too. They're like, oh, sorry
[00:30:14.210] 等等，是啊，我和朋友们也进行过很多类似的对话。他们会说，哦，抱歉。
[00:30:18.370] I'm like a couple episodes behind. I'm like, there's literally zero need to apologize
[00:30:18.370] 我落后了好几集。我觉得，完全没必要道歉。
[00:30:23.330] There's no obligation to me as a friend to keep up
[00:30:23.330] 作为朋友，我没有义务继续跟你保持联系。
[00:30:26.770] I'm like, dude, don't worry. We hang out in person like, you know podcast stories and all of that stuff you get to
[00:30:26.770] 我心想，兄弟，别担心。我们经常见面，你知道，就像录播客节目、聊故事之类的。
[00:30:33.250] learn in person instead of through like your headphones
[00:30:33.250] 亲自学习，而不是通过耳机学习。
[00:30:37.490] But then I feel like sometimes there's just kind of like silly or funny moments because of that because
[00:30:37.490] 但我觉得有时候正因为如此，才会出现一些有点傻气或搞笑的时刻。
[00:30:43.250] You know, occasionally I'll be talking to a friend and I'll tell some story and she's like, oh, yeah
[00:30:43.250] 你知道，有时候我和朋友聊天，讲一些故事，她就会说，哦，是啊。
[00:30:47.330] Like I heard that on your podcast and I was like, oh, sorry to like repeat the story and make you rehear it
[00:30:47.330] 我在你的播客里听到了这件事，然后我就说，哦，不好意思，我又重复一遍这个故事，让你再说一遍。
[00:30:52.770] But then later, you know, I'm like, okay, this person like tunes into the podcast usually
[00:30:52.770] 但后来，你知道，我就想，好吧，这个人通常会收听播客。
[00:30:57.650] So I'll just briefly reference the story and not like give the full, you know run down and I'll be like, yeah
[00:30:57.650] 所以我就简单提一下这个故事，不会详细展开，然后就说，嗯。
[00:31:03.410] Like I know I mentioned this on the podcast
[00:31:03.410] 我知道我在播客里也提到过这件事。
[00:31:05.570] But you know this happens so blah blah and I'll move on and then she's like, oh
[00:31:05.570] 但你知道这种事难免发生，所以巴拉巴拉，我会继续往前走，然后她就会说，哦
[00:31:09.410] I'm not like caught up actually like what's the story and I'm like fog. I can never get it exactly right
[00:31:09.410] 我其实没搞清楚状况，不知道到底发生了什么，就像一团迷雾。我永远也搞不清楚。
[00:31:15.090] You're like damn now. I sound like an asshole like, oh, you know on the podcast
[00:31:15.090] 你现在肯定觉得糟透了。我听起来像个混蛋，就像，你知道，在播客里那样。
[00:31:20.450] Like did you not listen?
[00:31:20.450] 你难道没听见吗？
[00:31:23.010] I also think it's funny when people maybe like you haven't seen someone in a while
[00:31:23.010] 我也觉得挺有意思的，比如像你这样好久没见朋友的人。
[00:31:28.210] You know, you go and hang out with them and they're like, oh dude
[00:31:28.210] 你知道，你去和他们一起玩，他们会说，哦，老兄
[00:31:30.530] I listened to like the most recent two episodes or something
[00:31:30.530] 我听了最近两集之类的。
[00:31:34.050] To like prep for our hangout and I'm like, oh dude, you really didn't need to do that
[00:31:34.050] 你为我们的聚会做了些准备，我就想，老兄，你真没必要这么做。
[00:31:38.450] Wait, I'm dead
[00:31:38.450] 等等，我死了
[00:31:40.530] I've also had so many hangouts where I'm like, hey, how are you?
[00:31:40.530] 我也经常和朋友聚会，互相问候：“嘿，你好吗？”
[00:31:43.970] And then the person is like, oh, I'm good. How are you?
[00:31:43.970] 然后那个人会说，哦，我很好。你呢？
[00:31:46.210] And then they're immediately launched into like, okay
[00:31:46.210] 然后他们立刻就进入了“好吧”的状态。
[00:31:48.290] I listened to your most recent episode and hear all my thoughts and opinions and feelings about it
[00:31:48.290] 我听了你们最新一期的节目，我的想法、意见和感受都和你们的节目很契合。
[00:31:52.530] And I'm just like holy fuck. It's like such a weird feeling
[00:31:52.530] 我当时就想，我的天哪。这感觉太奇怪了。
[00:31:55.410] But I'm just so grateful that people
[00:31:55.410] 但我非常感激人们
[00:31:57.890] Feel so much when they listen to certain episodes of our podcast
[00:31:57.890] 当他们收听我们播客的某些节目时，会感触良多。
[00:32:01.650] Because I feel like it's one thing to just like tune in and kind of listen to a podcast on background noise but
[00:32:01.650] 因为我觉得，只是随便听听播客，把它当成背景音乐来听，是一回事，但
[00:32:07.650] To have all these thoughts and feelings like takes a lot of emotional energy
[00:32:07.650] 拥有所有这些想法和感受需要消耗大量的精力。
[00:32:11.410] So I always appreciate when people, you know, mention
[00:32:11.410] 所以我总是很感激人们提及这件事。
[00:32:14.530] Whatever remarks that they had while listening to the episode. Yeah, I think ultimately it's like not an issue if our friends don't listen
[00:32:14.530] 无论他们在收听节目时发表了什么评论。是的，我觉得最终，如果我们的朋友不听，这也不是什么问题。
[00:32:22.930] But at the same time you're right
[00:32:22.930] 但同时你的说法也是对的。
[00:32:24.210] It is nice and cool if someone does listen and then they have like more to add on
[00:32:24.210] 如果有人愿意听取意见，并且还能补充更多内容，那真是太好了。
[00:32:29.090] Because then it's kind of like a conversation starter, which I think everyone maybe appreciates
[00:32:29.090] 因为这样就能开启一段对话，我想大家都会喜欢这一点。
[00:32:34.930] But of course, you know every hangout is not a book club for our podcast episodes
[00:32:34.930] 当然，你也知道，每次聚会并不是我们播客节目的读书会。
[00:32:39.090] So like please don't feel stress if you're our friends to like, you know, listen to everything
[00:32:39.090] 所以，如果你是我们的朋友，请不要感到压力，听我们说完所有事情。
[00:32:44.050] 100%
[00:32:44.050] 100%
[00:32:45.170] Ultimately it's kind of almost like a hobby, you know, like we don't have to talk about it
[00:32:45.170] 说到底，这几乎就像是一种爱好，你知道吗，就像我们不必非得谈论它一样。
[00:32:49.810] We can talk about it. There's no pressure from anything
[00:32:49.810] 我们可以谈谈这件事。没有任何压力。
[00:32:53.810] Yeah, definitely
[00:32:53.810] 是的，绝对的
[00:32:55.010] I think there's pros and cons to both sides whether your friend listens to it or not
[00:32:55.010] 我认为无论你的朋友是否听从他的建议，双方都有利弊。
[00:32:59.410] It's like if they do tune in then you can choose to talk about the episodes if you want
[00:32:59.410] 就好像如果他们收看了节目，你就可以选择是否讨论节目内容。
[00:33:04.370] But if they don't then you can still talk about maybe stuff that came up in the episodes or whatever
[00:33:04.370] 但如果他们不说话，你仍然可以聊聊剧集里出现的内容或其他什么。
[00:33:09.090] But it doesn't have to be like, oh, this was on my podcast. Well, blah
[00:33:09.090] 但没必要像这样，哦，这是我在播客里讲到的。嗯，呃
[00:33:12.690] So I think it's a nice plus
[00:33:12.690] 所以我觉得这是个不错的优势。
[00:33:15.410] But as you said definitely not something that we feel entitled to at all
[00:33:15.410] 但正如你所说，这绝对不是我们觉得自己有权得到的。
[00:33:19.650] Oh my god
[00:33:19.650] 我的天啊
[00:33:20.130] But speaking of like talking about podcast episodes, this might be kind of crazy, but
[00:33:20.130] 但说到讨论播客节目，这可能有点疯狂，但是……
[00:33:27.010] sometimes
[00:33:27.010] 有时
[00:33:28.370] when I
[00:33:28.370] 当我
[00:33:29.730] am like
[00:33:29.730] 我像
[00:33:30.930] Going to therapy and I need to like I'm thinking of what to share in therapy
[00:33:30.930] 我打算去做心理咨询，我在想咨询的时候该跟咨询师分享些什么。
[00:33:36.450] Sometimes I refer back to our episodes in my mind not like in the session but like in my mind
[00:33:36.450] 有时我会回想起我们讨论过的话题，不是像在咨询过程中那样，而是在我的脑海里。
[00:33:41.970] I'm like, hmm. Is there anything that we talked about on the podcast recently that I think I should bring up with my therapist
[00:33:41.970] 我心想，嗯……最近我们在播客里聊到的话题，有没有什么我觉得应该跟我的心理咨询师提一提的？
[00:33:51.090] Wait, holy shit
[00:33:51.090] 等等，我的天哪
[00:33:54.130] So it's like breathing in spo
[00:33:54.130] 所以这就像吸入空气一样。
[00:33:57.090] For your therapy sessions
[00:33:57.090] 您的治疗疗程
[00:33:58.770] Yeah, you know like how we did that crisis episode
[00:33:58.770] 对，你知道，就像我们处理那集危机特辑的方式一样。
[00:34:01.810] So I'll be like, hmm. Is there something that I missed there that I should talk, you know
[00:34:01.810] 所以我就会想，嗯，是不是我漏掉了什么应该说的话，你知道的。
[00:34:06.210] About with my therapist or stuff like that and then sometimes I'm like, I should just treat this therapy session as like a podcast recording
[00:34:06.210] 有时候我会跟我的治疗师聊一些类似的事情，然后我就会想，我应该把这次治疗过程当作录制播客一样来对待。
[00:34:18.030] Okay, I don't know I sometimes have the fear of like a run out of shit to say at therapy
[00:34:18.030] 好吧，我不知道，我有时候会害怕在心理咨询中会无话可说。
[00:34:23.390] So I'm like, okay. I should just like treat it like a podcast session
[00:34:23.390] 所以我就想，好吧。我应该把它当成一期播客节目来做。
[00:34:27.150] It's a regular conversation. Like it's all good
[00:34:27.150] 这是一段普通的对话，一切都很正常。
[00:34:30.030] And it like low key helps
[00:34:30.030] 而且它在某种程度上也起到了帮助作用。
[00:34:32.350] Damn, that's hella funny
[00:34:32.350] 真他妈搞笑
[00:34:33.790] I think I know what you mean
[00:34:33.790] 我想我明白你的意思了。
[00:34:34.990] Definitely when we do more of like those sensitive and like deeper emotional topic episodes
[00:34:34.990] 当然，当我们制作更多这类敏感且具有深度情感主题的节目时，情况肯定会有所不同。
[00:34:40.510] I do kind of mentally note like oh, maybe I should bring this up in therapy or sometimes it's like indirect too
[00:34:40.510] 我确实会在心里默默记下，比如，哦，也许我应该在咨询的时候提一下这件事，或者有时候也会用比较委婉的方式。
[00:34:45.470] Right, it's like we can be talking about some sort of completely random topic
[00:34:45.470] 对，感觉我们好像在聊一些完全随机的话题。
[00:34:49.710] But as we do that episode it makes me like feel certain emotions where I'm like question mark
[00:34:49.710] 但当我们看完那一集后，我会产生某种情绪，就像在问号一样。
[00:34:54.750] And then I'm like, okay. I I should probably take this to my therapist. Yeah, like low mental note
[00:34:54.750] 然后我就想，好吧。我可能应该把这事告诉我的心理咨询师。嗯，就像是心情低落的备忘录。
[00:35:00.670] Right bring this up next week
[00:35:00.670] 好的，下周再讨论这个问题。
[00:35:04.190] But in general like I can kind of relate to what you said about treating something like a podcast episode
[00:35:04.190] 但总的来说，我有点理解你说的把某件事当作播客节目来对待。
[00:35:09.950] Because I feel like it's helped
[00:35:09.950] 因为我觉得这很有帮助。
[00:35:12.270] A lot for me. I'm someone who has struggled with public speaking and just like feeling really nervous when I talk
[00:35:12.270] 对我来说意义重大。我一直很害怕公开演讲，一开口说话就特别紧张。
[00:35:18.910] And honestly just like struggling with even small talk and whatnot
[00:35:18.910] 老实说，我甚至连闲聊都觉得困难。
[00:35:22.670] But I feel like with podcasting one just
[00:35:22.670] 但我感觉播客就是这样，只需要一个人
[00:35:26.270] Meeting and like having two hour conversations with all these different people
[00:35:26.270] 与这些不同的人见面，并进行长达两小时的对话。
[00:35:30.590] And two just having these conversations on a regular basis
[00:35:30.590] 第二，要定期进行这些对话。
[00:35:34.110] Has actually helped a ton. I've noticed it a little bit in meetings, right?
[00:35:34.110] 确实很有帮助。我在开会的时候也感觉到了，对吧？
[00:35:37.870] But I kind of chalked it up to like, oh, maybe it's just because I'm
[00:35:37.870] 但我当时觉得，哦，也许只是因为我……
[00:35:41.710] Five years deep into my career now. So like I'm more used to talking in meetings and whatnot
[00:35:41.710] 入行五年了，我已经习惯了在会议上发言等等。
[00:35:45.950] But when I really noticed it was during our wedding
[00:35:45.950] 但真正让我注意到这一点是在我们的婚礼上。
[00:35:49.390] We did our vows to each other. Oh, yeah
[00:35:49.390] 我们互相宣誓了。哦，是的。
[00:35:52.190] And because there's like a hundred and something people like sitting there in front of me
[00:35:52.190] 因为前面坐着大概一百多个人。
[00:35:56.910] I thought that I would be really really nervous
[00:35:56.910] 我以为我会非常非常紧张
[00:35:59.310] But honestly standing up there on the altar with james in front of me
[00:35:59.310] 但说实话，站在圣坛上，詹姆斯就站在我面前……
[00:36:02.910] You by my side all of our bridesmaids and groomsmen near us and mike in hand
[00:36:02.910] 你陪在我身边，所有的伴娘伴郎都在我们身边，麦克风也拿着。
[00:36:06.990] I was like, I'm literally doing like a podcast episode and I did not feel nervous at all doing the vow
[00:36:06.990] 我当时就想，我这是在录制播客节目呢，而且在宣誓的时候我一点也不紧张。
[00:36:11.870] Dude
[00:36:11.870] 哥们
[00:36:12.990] That's so funny. Like the moment the mike is put in your hand, you're like, oh, I know this feeling. Yeah, exactly
[00:36:12.990] 太逗了。就像麦克风一到手，你就感觉，哦，我懂这种感觉。对，没错。
[00:36:20.190] Meanwhile james like shaking
[00:36:20.190] 与此同时，詹姆斯喜欢摇晃
[00:36:23.710] Just kidding. I don't know if he was actually shaking
[00:36:23.710] 开玩笑啦。我不知道他当时是不是真的在发抖。
[00:36:27.470] I think because I was sort of used to the podcast feeling
[00:36:27.470] 我想是因为我已经有点习惯播客的感觉了。
[00:36:30.350] It probably prevented me from like tearing up a little bit more too because I'm like, oh, I'm just like podcasting
[00:36:30.350] 这可能也让我没那么容易哭出来，因为我当时就想，哦，我只是在录播客而已。
[00:36:35.390] Like I wouldn't normally cry during a podcast episode
[00:36:35.390] 我平时听播客节目是不会哭的。
[00:36:37.710] You're like, I'm so ready for this very steady
[00:36:37.710] 你会想，我已经准备好迎接这种非常稳定的局面了。
[00:36:40.590] I remember when you were saying your vows, you were like
[00:36:40.590] 我记得你宣读誓词的时候，你就像……
[00:36:43.950] So composed and everyone was like, oh my god, jisoo was so good at giving her vows
[00:36:43.950] 她表现得非常沉着冷静，大家都惊叹道：“我的天哪，智秀宣誓的时候表现得太好了！”
[00:36:49.790] And then actually later during the wedding our parents and then our made of honor best man came up and did their speeches
[00:36:49.790] 后来，在婚礼进行到一半的时候，我们的父母和伴郎上台致辞。
[00:36:55.870] And then at the end james and I were supposed to give a speech
[00:36:55.870] 最后，詹姆斯和我还要发表讲话。
[00:36:58.830] I looked over at james and he was like, I think you should just do the speech like the thank you speech
[00:36:58.830] 我看了看詹姆斯，他说道：“我觉得你应该像做感谢演讲那样做个演讲。”
[00:37:03.150] And I was like, okay
[00:37:03.150] 我当时就想，好吧。
[00:37:03.790] And I just stood up with the mic and I like gave the thank you speech just off the dome
[00:37:03.790] 然后我就拿着麦克风站起来，即兴发表了感谢致辞。
[00:37:07.550] I was like, damn, I don't think I could have done this without five years of eat your crust experience
[00:37:07.550] 我当时想，天哪，如果没有这五年吃面包皮的经验，我真不知道自己能不能做到。
[00:37:11.950] Dude, that's character development
[00:37:11.950] 老兄，这才是角色塑造啊
[00:37:15.150] Who is she?
[00:37:15.150] 她是谁？
[00:37:17.230] Oh my god, that's so awesome
[00:37:17.230] 我的天哪，太棒了！
[00:37:18.990] Speaking of, you know how it's like kind of trained a muscle within us. I do remember
[00:37:18.990] 说到这个，你知道，这就像锻炼我们体内的某种肌肉一样。我记得很清楚。
[00:37:24.830] When we first started podcasting
[00:37:24.830] 我们刚开始做播客的时候
[00:37:27.470] After each recording I would be exhausted
[00:37:27.470] 每次录音结束后我都会筋疲力尽。
[00:37:31.070] It was just like an hour or maybe like two max of having a conversation
[00:37:31.070] 那大概就聊了一个小时，最多两个小时吧。
[00:37:36.430] And if you think about it, you're like, okay
[00:37:36.430] 仔细想想，你就会觉得，好吧。
[00:37:38.830] I shouldn't be exhausted at the end of this because we're just sitting down with our good friends and we're chatting
[00:37:38.830] 最后我不应该感到疲惫，因为我们只是和好朋友们坐在一起聊天而已。
[00:37:44.910] But I would be exhausted and I remember one time I asked you I was like, dude
[00:37:44.910] 但我当时会筋疲力尽，我记得有一次我问你，我说，老兄
[00:37:48.430] Just me or like I'm super tired after this recording and you're like, dude. I literally took a nap like I'm so tired
[00:37:48.430] 是不是只有我一个人这样，录完歌之后超级累，你会说，哥们儿，我真的累得都睡着了。
[00:37:55.070] I guess you know over time as we practiced by doing more podcasts
[00:37:55.070] 我想随着时间的推移，随着我们通过制作更多播客节目进行练习，你也逐渐明白了。
[00:38:00.510] I like don't get that fatigue as much now. I actually sometimes after our recording, I'm like more awake
[00:38:00.510] 我现在不太容易感到疲惫了。事实上，有时候录音结束后，我反而更精神。
[00:38:07.790] True. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like it used to take way more like
[00:38:07.790] 没错。是啊。是啊。我觉得以前需要的时间要长得多。
[00:38:11.550] Brainpower or something or maybe we were just like more tense and stiff and like nervous
[00:38:11.550] 脑力或其他什么原因，或许我们只是更紧张、更僵硬、更焦虑。
[00:38:16.990] I do feel like the way we approach podcast recording now is a little bit more casual than maybe when we first started
[00:38:16.990] 我觉得我们现在录制播客的方式比刚开始的时候要随意一些。
[00:38:22.670] But yeah, I feel like back then anytime we pressed the recording button. It was like tense shoulders like
[00:38:22.670] 但对，我觉得那时候每次我们按下录音键，肩膀都会像绷紧了一样。
[00:38:28.830] clogged the road just like shaking hands
[00:38:28.830] 就像握手一样，堵塞了道路。
[00:38:32.030] Oh my god
[00:38:32.030] 我的天啊
[00:38:32.830] I remember one time
[00:38:32.830] 我记得有一次
[00:38:34.750] I think it was like I was out earlier in the day for
[00:38:34.750] 我觉得我好像当天早些时候出去过。
[00:38:38.990] I don't know someone's birthday or something of that sort
[00:38:38.990] 我不知道别人的生日之类的信息。
[00:38:42.270] And so I got back and this was when I was in New York
[00:38:42.270] 于是我回到了纽约，当时我正在纽约。
[00:38:44.670] So I got back it was a little later in the day and we were doing our podcast recording
[00:38:44.670] 我回到家的时候已经有点晚了，我们正在录制播客。
[00:38:49.150] And because it was like, you know, I was out celebrating earlier. I was, you know, just a little tipsy
[00:38:49.150] 因为你知道，我之前出去庆祝了一番，有点微醺。
[00:38:55.150] And when I like went back later to edit the episode. I was like wait, I'm like popping off on this episode
[00:38:55.150] 后来我回去剪辑这集的时候，突然意识到，等等，我这集好像有点太投入了。
[00:39:02.430] I was like damn like I'm looser. I'm asking good questions
[00:39:02.430] 我当时就想，完了，我真是个失败者。我问的问题都很好。
[00:39:06.910] I was like, okay
[00:39:06.910] 我当时就想，好吧。
[00:39:07.870] So like we don't have to be so stiff and like nervous all the time
[00:39:07.870] 所以我们就不必总是那么拘谨和紧张了。
[00:39:12.590] That's true
[00:39:12.590] 这是真的
[00:39:13.230] And there's definitely like a little bit of merit that comes with being more casual
[00:39:13.230] 而且，更随意一些的做法确实也有一些优点。
[00:39:17.390] Like I feel like it relaxes our guests as well
[00:39:17.390] 我觉得它也能让我们的客人放松下来。
[00:39:20.670] And makes it a little bit less
[00:39:20.670] 并使其略微减少
[00:39:22.670] Formal. Yeah, but I think like going back to the feeling super tired thing
[00:39:22.670] 正式的。是啊，但我觉得就像又回到了那种超级疲惫的感觉。
[00:39:26.910] We also used to do like back-to-back recording sometimes
[00:39:26.910] 我们以前也经常会连续录音。
[00:39:29.950] Oh, true on weeks where we would try to cram stuff and I would
[00:39:29.950] 哦，确实，在那些我们试图集中精力学习的周里，我会……
[00:39:34.030] Say that you know with traveling and whatnot now
[00:39:34.030] 假设你现在对旅行之类的事情有所了解
[00:39:36.430] It's not like we don't do like double episode weekends
[00:39:36.430] 我们又不是没搞过周末双集连播之类的活动。
[00:39:39.790] But back then we would literally like be to be it like 10 minute break in between
[00:39:39.790] 但那时候，我们真的希望中间能有10分钟的休息时间。
[00:39:44.030] Wait, you're so right
[00:39:44.030] 等等，你说得太对了
[00:39:46.350] And I'm like, why do we do that?
[00:39:46.350] 我当时就想，我们为什么要这样做？
[00:39:47.950] Now we're good and we'll do like one on Friday one on Saturday
[00:39:47.950] 现在一切就绪，我们周五做一场，周六做一场。
[00:39:51.310] If we need to do like a double episode weekend
[00:39:51.310] 如果需要的话，比如周末播出双集。
[00:39:53.470] But back then we literally raw-dogged it for like four hours at a time
[00:39:53.470] 但那时候我们真的连续四个小时不戴套就上床。
[00:39:57.790] I remember one time we were like, okay lunch break meet back here in like 20 minutes
[00:39:57.790] 我记得有一次，我们说：“好了，午休时间20分钟后在这里集合。”
[00:40:04.190] It was like a work day
[00:40:04.190] 就像上班一样
[00:40:06.910] I think another pro though speaking of lunch breaks to all this like recording
[00:40:06.910] 我觉得另一个优点是，说到午休时间，还有录制这些内容之类的。
[00:40:11.630] Is that whenever we do in-person recordings
[00:40:11.630] 是不是每次我们进行现场录音时都是这样？
[00:40:14.670] It's extra nice because you know, not only are we hanging out for the podcast
[00:40:14.670] 这感觉特别棒，因为你知道，我们不仅是为了播客而待着。
[00:40:19.070] But we can easily extend that hangout more
[00:40:19.070] 但我们可以很容易地延长这次聚会的时间。
[00:40:23.390] So usually if we do an in-person recording with our friends
[00:40:23.390] 所以通常情况下，如果我们和朋友们一起进行面对面的录音。
[00:40:26.350] We try to grab like lunch or dinner after or before
[00:40:26.350] 我们尽量在之后或之前吃午饭或晚饭。
[00:40:30.670] Or you know, just go out grab some tea and like spend some extra time together
[00:40:30.670] 或者，你知道，就出去喝杯茶，多花点时间在一起。
[00:40:34.910] I remember our recent recording that we mentioned earlier with brian
[00:40:34.910] 我记得我们之前提到的和布莱恩一起录制的那段音频。
[00:40:39.630] That ended up turning into like a whole day hangout because we haven't seen him in a while
[00:40:39.630] 结果那天晚上我们一起待了一整天，因为我们好久没见到他了。
[00:40:43.950] And he like only recently moved back to the bay
[00:40:43.950] 他好像是最近才搬回海湾的。
[00:40:46.590] So we were like, oh well, we might as well just like
[00:40:46.590] 所以我们就想，好吧，我们不如就这么办吧
[00:40:49.710] You know extend this hangout since we're all here already
[00:40:49.710] 既然大家都在这儿，不如延长一下这次聚会吧。
[00:40:53.070] And I think those are just like really nice moments that we get to have because of the podcast
[00:40:53.070] 我认为这些都是我们因为播客而拥有的美好时刻。
[00:41:00.110] I know it's like something so simple, but I feel like it always makes me feel so grateful about how
[00:41:00.110] 我知道这只是件很简单的事，但它总是让我对这一切充满感激。
[00:41:06.110] Much deeper we can make our connections with our friends through the podcast and really it's like an excuse to hang out
[00:41:06.110] 更深层次地，我们可以通过播客与朋友建立联系，这真的就像一个聚会的借口。
[00:41:11.310] Right. Yeah, the recording is one thing, but I think we literally
[00:41:11.310] 对。是啊，录音是一回事，但我觉得我们实际上
[00:41:15.150] Got dinner and then like rotted playing 2k on our couch for like four to five hours
[00:41:15.150] 吃过晚饭后，我们就瘫在沙发上玩了四五个小时的2K游戏。
[00:41:21.950] And I was like this is just so nice
[00:41:21.950] 我当时就想，这真是太好了。
[00:41:23.710] And there's something very special about having that hangout after a recording with a friend
[00:41:23.710] 录音结束后和朋友一起聚会，感觉非常特别。
[00:41:27.950] Especially someone you haven't seen in a long time
[00:41:27.950] 尤其是很久没见的人
[00:41:30.430] Was just so chill so casual and you guys all collectively like accomplish something. So, you know, I definitely relish those moments as well
[00:41:30.430] 当时的气氛特别轻松随意，你们大家一起完成了一件很棒的事情。所以，你知道，我也很珍惜那些时刻。
[00:41:38.270] I think the podcast also loosens us up because you know, we get the conversation flowing
[00:41:38.270] 我觉得播客也能让我们放松下来，因为你知道，它能让谈话自然而然地展开。
[00:41:43.870] And sometimes we even break into like a bit of a deep talk for the pod
[00:41:43.870] 有时候我们甚至会在播客里进行一些深入的对话。
[00:41:47.950] And so, you know getting out of that returning. We're just like, oh, yeah, like we could talk about anything
[00:41:47.950] 所以，你知道，摆脱那种状态之后，我们就像，哦，是啊，我们可以聊任何事。
[00:41:52.910] We can do anything now
[00:41:52.910] 我们现在可以做任何事了
[00:41:54.590] We're super comfortable and ready. Oh my god, also
[00:41:54.590] 我们感觉非常舒适，准备就绪。我的天哪，还有
[00:41:58.190] This is something that our listeners would not know but I think anyone who has recorded with us before
[00:41:58.190] 这是我们的听众可能不知道的事情，但我认为任何以前和我们一起录音的人都应该知道。
[00:42:03.390] Has experienced this but I feel like the tea sesh right after the recording is over is always so juicy
[00:42:03.390] 我也经历过这种情况，但我感觉录音结束后的茶话会总是特别精彩。
[00:42:10.830] And it's not always something like super deep or anything, right? Like depending on the topic
[00:42:10.830] 而且也不总是那种特别深刻的东西，对吧？这取决于具体话题。
[00:42:14.110] Whatever the gossip might be might not be as
[00:42:14.110] 无论流言蜚语是什么，都可能并非如此。
[00:42:17.470] Major, you know, we always leave like five to ten minutes after the recording is over to talk about things that
[00:42:17.470] 你知道，Major，我们总会在录音结束后留出五到十分钟的时间来聊聊其他事情。
[00:42:23.150] We wouldn't want aired on a podcast episode and it's always very interesting. That's true
[00:42:23.150] 我们不想在播客节目里播出，而且这事儿总是很有意思。确实如此。
[00:42:27.710] Sometimes we're like, okay, we're off air now
[00:42:27.710] 有时候我们会想，好了，我们现在停播了。
[00:42:31.230] So what was that story you mentioned earlier on the podcast? Like what was that that you just said? Like we can't just gloss over it
[00:42:31.230] 所以你之前在播客里提到的那个故事是什么来着？你刚才说的到底是什么？我们不能就这么一带而过。
[00:42:38.830] Many redacted details, I would say
[00:42:38.830] 可以说，很多细节都被删减了。
[00:42:41.710] Yeah, I think ultimately the podcast has brought a lot of joy for us and
[00:42:41.710] 是的，我认为最终这个播客给我们带来了很多快乐。
[00:42:47.310] You know, it's kind of crazy really to think about it that it's been five years
[00:42:47.310] 你知道吗，仔细想想，已经过去五年了，真是有点不可思议。
[00:42:51.630] And it's also just crazy that we have so many people listening to the podcast
[00:42:51.630] 而且，有这么多人听我们的播客，这简直太不可思议了。
[00:42:56.190] I think every time we get like a thank you message or just someone reaches out to us. We're always super
[00:42:56.190] 我觉得每次收到感谢信息或者有人联系我们的时候，我们都非常开心。
[00:43:01.950] Grateful, we're not always able to respond right away, but we will get to your message no matter what
[00:43:01.950] 非常感谢您的支持，我们可能无法立即回复，但无论如何，我们都会尽快回复您的信息。
[00:43:07.950] So we appreciate that and everyone's patience as well
[00:43:07.950] 所以，我们对此表示感谢，也感谢大家的耐心。
[00:43:12.030] But yeah, I think it's just kind of crazy reflecting back on the last five years
[00:43:12.030] 是啊，回想过去五年，感觉真是有点不可思议。
[00:43:16.910] I know it has been such a dream and
[00:43:16.910] 我知道这曾是一个梦想，
[00:43:20.190] I feel like when I think back to how the idea was even started in the first place like it never felt like
[00:43:20.190] 回想起最初萌生这个想法时的情景，我感觉一切都那么自然而然，仿佛从未有过这种感觉。
[00:43:25.790] Oh, let's launch this long-term project together
[00:43:25.790] 哦，让我们一起启动这个长期项目吧。
[00:43:29.230] But you know looking back on the journey. That's basically what this has become
[00:43:29.230] 但你知道，回首这段旅程，它基本上就是这样了。
[00:43:34.270] So it's just I don't know. It's really crazy honestly
[00:43:34.270] 所以，我真的不知道。说实话，这太疯狂了。
[00:43:37.230] And I think
[00:43:37.230] 我觉得
[00:43:38.430] I would never claim that we are like a perfect podcast or anything at all
[00:43:38.430] 我绝不会声称我们的播客完美无缺，或者其他什么。
[00:43:42.590] But considering how we started this podcast, we have definitely come a long way and you know
[00:43:42.590] 但考虑到我们当初是如何开始做这个播客的，我们确实已经走了很远的路，你知道的。
[00:43:49.470] More to come on this journey
[00:43:49.470] 这段旅程还有更多精彩内容，敬请期待。
[00:43:50.990] But thank you everyone including all our friends our family honestly like everyone who supports us and
[00:43:50.990] 但是，我要感谢所有人，包括我们所有的朋友、家人，真心感谢所有支持我们的人。
[00:43:56.910] Our listeners for even just being with us along on this journey
[00:43:56.910] 感谢各位听众朋友们一路陪伴我们走过这段旅程
[00:44:00.990] Agreed. Thank you so much for the last five years and we look forward to the
