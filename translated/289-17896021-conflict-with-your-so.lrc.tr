[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. So for today's topic, we wanted to talk about something that I think is commonly experienced and not as commonly talked about, and it is conflict with your SO. A lot of people handle conflict differently already, but on top of that, there's an added layer of complication because people approach relationships differently.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。今天我们想聊聊一个我认为很常见但却很少被公开谈论的话题：和伴侣之间的冲突。很多人处理冲突的方式本来就各不相同，再加上每个人对待感情的方式都不一样，情况就变得更加复杂了。
[00:00:37.430] So today we'll kind of dive into how our personal approach to conflict in our relationships are. So let's start this off by kind of setting the stage. How often do you think you have conflict with your SO? And I'm realizing that I keep saying SO, and we got a comment from a listener who asked what SO means. SO stands for significant other. So it's a very common way to refer to your romantic partner.
[00:00:37.430] 今天我们来深入探讨一下个人在人际关系中处理冲突的方式。首先，我们来设定一下背景。你觉得你和你的伴侣（SO）多久会发生一次冲突？我意识到我一直在说“SO”，有一位听众留言问“SO”是什么意思。“SO”是“重要他人”（Signature Other）的缩写。这是对伴侣的一种非常常见的称呼。
[00:01:03.770] So how often I have conflict with my SO? I think a lot more in the beginning of the relationship, because that's kind of the time where you're getting to know each other, and you're starting to learn about where there is conflict in the relationship.
[00:01:03.770] 那么我和我的伴侣多久会发生一次冲突呢？我觉得在恋爱初期冲突会比较多，因为那段时间你们正在互相了解，也开始发现彼此关系中存在的冲突点。
[00:01:24.990] And I think it's a little hard, maybe in the beginning to bring it up. But once you start to realize it's okay, and it's good for the relationship, then I think there's like a period of time where there's just a lot of conflict as you figure yourselves out. I totally agree with you because I think there are phases in the relationship where conflict happens way more frequently, and phases where there's like minimal to no conflict.
[00:01:24.990] 我觉得一开始可能有点难开口。但一旦你意识到这样做没问题，而且对彼此的关系有益，那么接下来就会有一段时间，你们会因为彼此了解而产生很多冲突。我完全同意你的看法，因为我觉得恋爱关系中确实存在一些阶段，冲突会频繁发生，也会有一些阶段，冲突很少甚至没有。
[00:01:53.750] Thinking back on my own experiences, it happens a lot during transitional phases. So like you said, in a new relationship where you're going from the talking phase to a more serious established relationship with its own guardrails. Or even times when we were actively job hunting and heading towards college graduation, where so many things were unknown, I think was when we experienced a lot of conflict.
[00:01:53.750] 回想我自己的经历，这种情况在过渡阶段经常发生。就像你说的，在一段新的恋情中，从聊天阶段过渡到更稳定、更有界限的恋爱关系。或者甚至是在我们积极找工作、即将大学毕业的时候，很多事情都充满未知，我想那段时间我们经历了很多冲突。
[00:02:17.890] Hmm. I think I had that phase in the beginning, as I kind of explained, when the relationship was still pretty new. But nowadays, I think maybe we've like hit a phase where there's kind of equilibrium. Like, like you said, it's like not a huge transition phase right now. The amount of conflict has probably lessened a little bit.
[00:02:17.890] 嗯。我觉得刚开始的时候确实有过那种阶段，就像我之前解释的那样，那时候我们的关系还很新。但现在，我觉得我们可能已经到了一个比较平衡的阶段。就像你说的，现在并不是一个很大的过渡期。冲突可能也减少了一些。
[00:02:42.790] But I guess another question is, what do you even consider to be conflict? That does make me think because it's not like in our day to day life. My husband and I don't have things we disagree on. Something that I feel like commonly comes up for us is when the house starts to get a little messy, you know, if the Roomba is stuck on something, sometimes I'll like send him a photo like, look, your Roomba is eating your headphone wires, like you should put that away.
[00:02:42.790] 但我想问的另一个问题是，你认为什么才算是冲突？这确实让我思考，因为这跟我们日常生活中的冲突不太一样。我和我丈夫之间几乎没有分歧。我觉得我们之间比较常见的情况是，当家里开始有点乱的时候，比如扫地机器人被什么东西卡住了，我有时会给他发张照片，比如，“你看，你的扫地机器人把你的耳机线缠住了，你应该把它收起来。”
[00:03:12.850] But I wouldn't necessarily consider that conflict because I wasn't seeking a resolution on it, I guess. Like I wasn't trying to have a discussion and then like a resolution phase. It was just something funny to kind of point out that you should fix this. That could be a definition of conflict. Something that requires a sit down, one on one conversation. And I feel the need to fully resolve it to move forward.
[00:03:12.850] 但我并不一定认为那算得上冲突，因为我当时并没有寻求解决之道。我并不是想进行讨论，然后达成某种共识。我只是觉得好玩，想提醒大家应该解决这个问题。这或许可以算作一种冲突：需要坐下来，一对一地谈谈。我觉得有必要彻底解决这个问题，才能继续前进。
[00:03:39.630] That makes sense. And I think I agree. The natural next step in conflict, I think is to discuss it and talk it through, just like you said. And I think when I define a moment or like a situation to be a situation of conflict, is when there's something that we don't quite see eye to eye on, you know, whether that's like, you fold your laundry this way, and I fold it this way.
[00:03:39.630] 这很有道理。我也同意。我认为冲突的下一步自然就是讨论和沟通，就像你说的。我觉得，当我把某个时刻或某种情况定义为冲突时，就是我们在某些事情上意见不一致的时候，比如，你这样叠衣服，我那样叠。
[00:04:08.690] I mean, yeah, that's like a very light example. But it's like, in that moment, you kind of decide, is this going to be a topic of conflict where I think I need to talk it out, you know, figure some middle ground here? Or is it something that is just how they are and doesn't really bother me? So it's something I can just move on from.
[00:04:08.690] 我的意思是，是啊，这只是个很简单的例子。但就像，在那一刻，你会决定，这会不会成为一个需要好好谈谈、寻求折中方案的冲突话题？还是说，这只是他们的性格，我并不在意？所以我可以就此作罢。
[00:04:32.830] I guess it's kind of like, can I just laugh this off and accept it as is? Or does there need to be like fundamental change?
[00:04:32.830] 我觉得这有点像，我能一笑置之，接受现状吗？还是需要做出一些根本性的改变？
[00:05:09.050] Yeah. If I can do that, then I wouldn't really see that as conflict. I'm just like, oh, that went over pretty well. I see. Your husband just turns it into a, oh, okay, no problem. Yeah. Oh, shit. I was ready. Exactly. I had all these bullet points to back myself up. But I guess once you know that there's something that's conflict material, you know, like a potential conflict. Yeah.
[00:05:09.050] 是啊。如果我能那样做，我就不会觉得那是冲突了。我就会想，哦，这事儿进展得挺顺利的。我明白了。你老公就把它变成，哦，好吧，没问题。是啊。哦，糟了。我明明准备好了。没错。我准备了一大堆理由来支撑自己。但我想，一旦你意识到有些事情可能引发冲突，比如潜在的冲突，那就另当别论了。是啊。
[00:05:35.530] And it's been bothering you and you want to bring it up to your partner. What are some of your common openers? Okay, openers, I feel like are so hard. So sometimes I think my openers are just like, a little straight up, maybe. Maybe. I've definitely said before, like, oh, I have something to say. That's so ominous.
[00:05:35.530] 这件事一直困扰着你，你想和伴侣谈谈。你们通常用什么开场白呢？好吧，我觉得开场白真的很难。所以有时候我觉得我的开场白有点太直接了，可能吧。我以前肯定说过，哦，我有话要说。这听起来好不祥啊。
[00:06:01.610] Or, oh, I think we should talk about this. Or sometimes there's not even an opener and I just go straight into it. Oh. About like this thing that happened. Dude, it is like the hardest part, I think, of bringing something up. Because whether I want it to or not, sometimes the opening line sets the stage or like sets the mood a little bit.
[00:06:01.610] 或者，哦，我觉得我们应该聊聊这个。有时候甚至连开场白都没有，我就直接切入正题。哦，比如说之前发生的那件事。老兄，我觉得最难的就是开口。因为不管我愿不愿意，有时候开场白就能奠定基调，或者说营造气氛。
[00:06:26.190] I have to admit, sometimes the conflict that I want to talk about tumbles out of me before I could even stop it. Yeah. Before, I used to always be like, I just think it's funny. Which is the worst. Do not use that one. But occasionally that one comes out of me still. Oh my god, I know actually a signature one I do. Sometimes I'd say, I've been thinking. And then my boyfriend will be like, uh-oh.
[00:06:26.190] 我得承认，有时候我想说的那些冲突，还没来得及阻止，就脱口而出了。是啊。以前我总是说，我觉得这事儿挺搞笑的。这招最糟糕了。千万别用这招。但偶尔我还是会脱口而出。天哪，我还有一句标志性的借口。有时候我会说，我一直在想。然后我男朋友就会说，糟了。
[00:06:55.250] Here we go. Another one that I like to do is start it off by heavy caveat-ing. Mm-hmm. So I would say something like, you know, it's not that big of a deal. And I'm not like upset or anything. But I do feel like this thing sometimes bothers me. Mm-hmm. A lot of like, oh, I don't want to fight. Like, I'm not bringing this up as a big deal. But, and then I feel safer to bring it up. Mm-hmm. Which is kind of funny because I'm like, what kind of response is that?
[00:06:55.250] 好了，开始吧。我喜欢用的另一个方法是先加一大堆附加条件。嗯哼。我会说，你知道，这其实没那么严重。我也没生气什么的。但我确实觉得这件事有时候挺烦人的。嗯哼。很多时候我会想，哦，我不想吵架。我并不是说这件事很严重。但是，然后我觉得说出来会更安心。嗯哼。这其实挺搞笑的，因为我会想，这算什么回应啊？
[00:07:25.030] My husband is very calm. I feel like he's like a pretty chill person. Yeah. But for some reason, I still feel the need to de-escalate something that's not even escalated in the first place. He's like, all right, get to the point. Yeah. He's like, okay, sure. Okay, have you ever done like, maybe you're in a conversation and then something just pops up into your mind and you're like, damn, now I have to work this into the conversation and just like bring it up somehow.
[00:07:25.030] 我老公很冷静。我觉得他是个挺随和的人。是啊。但不知怎么的，我还是会觉得需要去缓和一些根本没升级的事情。他会说，好了，说重点吧。是啊。他会说，好的，当然。好吧，你有没有过这种经历，比如你们在聊天，突然脑子里冒出一个想法，然后你就想，糟了，现在我得把这个话题融入到聊天里，想办法把它提出来？
[00:07:53.490] Oh, you mean you're talking about something completely different and then you feel the need to like open up this new conversation about it? It could be super different or it could even be a little connected. Oh. I think it's hard for me to like rein that back. I would probably just bring it up. Yeah. Same, same. I think it's ultimately harder to hold it in and not start the discussion because the
[00:07:53.490] 哦，你是说你本来在聊完全不同的事情，然后突然觉得有必要就这件事展开新的对话？这可能完全不同，也可能有点关联。哦。我觉得我很难克制住这种冲动。我可能还是会提起它。是啊。我也是。我觉得最终还是很难忍住不去开启这个话题，因为……
[00:08:18.130] longer you hold it in, I think the more upset you start to feel about it because you're stewing in on this thing that's kind of bothering you. And then your partner has no idea. So they're just going about their day as usual, doing the same stuff that they do. And then every time they do it, you're like, oh, like I've been thinking about this for the past week and they're still doing it. Like how would they know? Right. So true.
[00:08:18.130] 你越是把这件事憋在心里，我觉得你就会越难过，因为你一直在纠结这件事。而你的伴侣却毫不知情。他们照常过着日子，做着同样的事情。然后每次他们这样做，你就会想，哦，我过去一周都在想这件事，他们居然还在做。他们怎么会知道呢？没错。确实如此。
[00:08:44.030] And I do feel like the more conflicts that you encounter with your SO, you start to kind of build that trust that it will go over fine, even if you bring up something that feels complex and emotional. And in my mind, a conflict can go two ways. One way is that they totally understand your point. They just never noticed, never thought that it bothered you. And then they're like, I'll just rectify this going forward. The other way is that they disagree and then you find some sort of compromise.
[00:08:44.030] 我觉得，和伴侣之间冲突越多，你们就越能建立起信任，即使你提出一些复杂又情绪化的问题，最终也能顺利解决。在我看来，冲突有两种可能。一种是他们完全理解你的观点，只是之前没注意到，也没觉得这会让你困扰。然后他们会说：“我以后会改正的。”另一种是他们不同意你的观点，然后你们找到某种妥协方案。
[00:09:12.690] But even the second option is not necessarily that bad because you're just kind of figuring out what the equilibrium, like you said, is for your relationship moving forward. So I feel like once you experience a bunch of these conflicts, you feel more comfortable bringing stuff up. Yeah. And I think ultimately having conflict is a good thing because if you don't, then that means, I mean, maybe you just fit so harmoniously and perfectly, but I think more realistically,
[00:09:12.690] 但即使是第二种选择也未必那么糟糕，因为就像你说的，你们只是在摸索如何才能让这段关系朝着更好的方向发展。所以我觉得，经历过很多冲突之后，你们就会更愿意坦诚地提出问题。是的。而且我认为，最终有冲突是件好事，因为如果没有冲突，那就意味着，我的意思是，也许你们相处得非常融洽完美，但我认为更现实的情况是，
[00:09:41.750] if you're both not bringing stuff up, then it just means you're both suppressing parts of yourself or sacrificing someone's comfort. I think I've learned over time that conflict is good and it's helped to try to normalize the phrase even. Like this is conflict and that's good. For sure. Although I will say, I feel like now in my late 20s and I've been in this relationship
[00:09:41.750] 如果你们俩都不主动提出问题，那就意味着你们都在压抑自己的一部分感受，或者牺牲对方的舒适感。我觉得随着时间的推移，我逐渐明白冲突是好事，甚至尝试接受“冲突”这个词也很有帮助。比如，这就是冲突，而冲突是好事。当然。不过话说回来，我现在快30岁了，也谈了一段时间恋爱，感觉自己对这段感情有了更深的理解。
[00:10:10.730] for a long time, I understand what a normal conflict looks like. But when I was young and first starting out in my relationship, everything I knew about conflict was either something that I saw from my parents or something I watched from media, movies and Korean dramas. And they fight pretty crazy in Korean dramas. So I remember some of my first fights when I was 16, 17, they were kind of bad.
[00:10:10.730] 很久以来，我都明白正常的冲突是什么样子。但年轻的时候，刚开始谈恋爱的时候，我对冲突的了解要么来自父母，要么来自媒体、电影和韩剧。韩剧里的争吵都挺激烈的。所以我记得我十六七岁时经历的几次争吵，都挺糟糕的。
[00:10:39.790] And I just didn't know how to fight. Like, I think that's what I thought a normal fight was back then. I think that's a good point. Media always plays up the, you know, arguments in a relationship. And so you end up seeing all these yelling matches or like someone slamming the door and stomping out or, you know, some like really dramatic exit. But I feel like that's not how I handle conflict at all. Yes. I totally agree.
[00:10:39.790] 我当时根本不知道该怎么吵架。我觉得那时候我以为的正常吵架就是那样。你说得对。媒体总是夸大情侣间的争吵。所以你会看到各种各样的叫喊，或者有人摔门而去，或者其他一些非常戏剧化的离场方式。但我感觉我处理冲突的方式完全不一样。是的，我完全同意。
[00:11:10.030] Interestingly, it's also not how my parents handle conflict. I feel like it was my mind getting pulled into two different directions. Of course, as like a teenager, you're very hormonal, very emotional. You like don't know how to rein in feelings yet or like process them. So I feel like back then everything felt very high intensity. Yeah. And then now looking back, I'm like, damn, it wasn't even that serious at all. You know, like things that we deal with now are way more serious than it was in high school.
[00:11:10.030] 有趣的是，这也不是我父母处理冲突的方式。我觉得当时我的思绪被拉扯到两个不同的方向。当然，作为一个青少年，你荷尔蒙分泌旺盛，情绪波动很大。你还不知道如何控制或处理自己的情绪。所以我觉得那时候一切都显得非常紧张。是的。但现在回想起来，我会想，天哪，当时根本没那么严重。你知道，我们现在遇到的事情比高中时要严重得多。
[00:11:38.970] But the intensity is kind of switched. Wait, that's so true. I feel like in, you know, high school and stuff, the thought was, wow, this is end of the relationship worthy stuff. Yeah. You're just like, wow, I can't believe you disagreed with me on something. And then you're like, it's over. Thinking back, I'm like, why was that the default? Like, oh, I guess it's over then if we just don't agree on this thing.
[00:11:38.970] 但这种感觉的强度好像反过来了。等等，确实如此。我觉得在高中那会儿，人们会想，哇，这事儿足以让这段关系结束了。是啊。你会想，哇，真不敢相信你居然跟我意见不合。然后你就会想，完了。现在想想，我就想，为什么当时默认就是这样？好像，哦，如果我们在这件事上意见不合，那就结束了。
[00:12:04.850] For some reason, like compromise was not even a thought. I guess everything was high stakes, you know, like every action could be the relationship ending action. But at the same time, I think it was only like that because the relationships were so low stakes, you know, it wasn't as serious or as weighty as the relationships that we're in now. So we're just fabricating drama for ourselves.
[00:12:04.850] 不知为何，妥协似乎根本不在他们的考虑范围之内。我想一切都至关重要，你知道，好像每个举动都可能导致关系破裂。但同时，我觉得之所以如此，只是因为那些关系风险很低，不像我们现在的关系那样严肃或重要。所以我们只是在自导自演。
[00:12:32.170] Hey, if there's an age to do that, I guess that's like the peak age. Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I was never in like a super long relationship in high school. I feel like the people who have been in longer relationships back then probably did learn a lot more about like conflict resolution, but I only had short ones. So I was kind of like, yeah, it's over from here. You're like, on to the next. I'm like, whatever.
[00:12:32.170] 嘿，如果真有哪个年龄段适合谈恋爱的话，我觉得高中时期就是巅峰了。是啊。说实话，我高中时从来没谈过特别长的恋爱。我觉得那时候谈过比较长恋爱的人可能确实学到了很多解决冲突的技巧，但我谈的都是短恋。所以我就觉得，嗯，这段感情到此为止了。你会说，开始下一段吧。我就觉得，随便吧。
[00:13:03.230] Aside from the dramatics of watching people fight on TV, I also mentioned that I was kind of pulling from the way that my parents fought. Then and now, do you think you fight like how your parents fight? Dude, absolutely not. My parents, they raise their voices at times. And my dad has kind of a short temper. So he like can get kind of intense. So when I was a kid, I was like, oh, my God, that's so scary.
[00:13:03.230] 除了看电视上人们打架的戏剧性之外，我还提到过，我的一些打架方式也受到了我父母的影响。你觉得你以前和现在打架的方式像你父母吗？兄弟，绝对不像。我父母有时候会提高嗓门。我爸脾气比较急躁，所以他有时候会很激动。我小时候就觉得，我的天哪，这太可怕了。
[00:13:32.310] So I don't know if it was necessarily a conscious decision. But I also think it's maybe just my personality, too. But like, I think it's generally pretty rare for me to like raise my voice at anyone. Do you ever think about it when you go into your fights with your SO where you're like, oh, I want to make sure I'm not fighting how I used to see it in my parents? No, that's the thing. It's like not really a top of mind thing. It's just kind of like, OK, well, we need to talk about this.
[00:13:32.310] 所以我不知道这是否是刻意为之。但我觉得这可能也跟我的性格有关。总之，我很少会对别人大声说话。你跟伴侣吵架的时候，会不会想着“哦，我得确保我的争吵方式不会像我小时候看父母那样”？不会，就是这样。这根本不是我的首要考虑。只是感觉，好吧，我们需要谈谈这件事。
[00:13:58.770] Maybe like a little bit where it's like, I would never want this to escalate into like a yelling match. Yeah. I think that thought helps me approach how to say stuff sometimes. Like don't say really rude words or like don't rage bait your partner. Yeah, like keep it less inflammatory. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But I don't think it's like I prep myself for a conflict and I'm like, all right, don't yell like my parents do. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:58.770] 可能有点像那种感觉，我绝对不想让事情升级成一场争吵。嗯。我觉得这种想法能帮助我更好地处理说话方式。比如，不要说特别粗鲁的话，或者不要激怒你的伴侣。对，尽量避免火上浇油。对，对，没错。但我不会事先给自己做心理准备，告诉自己“好吧，别像我父母那样大吼大叫”。你明白我的意思吗？嗯，嗯，嗯。
[00:14:28.510] I like that you have, I mean, subconscious or not, like learnings from that, though. Yeah. Actually, a really funny thing is we've talked about this before, like outside of the podcast or sometimes if we're having a discussion with our SOs, instead of like raising our voices, we're kind of like, wait, you're talking too loud. Keep the voice down.
[00:14:28.510] 我很高兴你从中吸取了教训，不管是潜意识的还是有意识的。是啊。其实，一件很有趣的事是我们之前也聊过这个，比如在播客之外，或者有时候我们和伴侣讨论问题的时候，我们不会提高音量，而是会说：“等等，你说话太大声了。小声点。”
[00:14:52.910] Because I think it's very natural for your voice to get a little louder or you to talk a little faster in moments of emotion or if you feel like kind of anxious, like you need to say your part. But yeah, luckily, it's never escalated to the point of yelling. And then sometimes I think if I notice that I myself am talking at a slightly louder volume or our conversation is slowly like getting a little louder. I'm like, wait, hold on before we move on.
[00:14:52.910] 因为我觉得在情绪激动或者感到焦虑，觉得必须把话说完的时候，声音稍微提高一点或者语速加快是很自然的。不过还好，这种情况从来没有发展到大喊大叫的地步。有时候，如果我注意到自己说话的声音稍微大了一点，或者我们的谈话音量慢慢地也变大了，我就会想，等等，先别急着继续。
[00:15:22.810] Like, you know, you know, in elementary school where teachers are like saying stuff in the front of the class to keep the volume down, like everyone clap twice if you can hear me. But I agree. I feel like something like volume or intensity is something you can lose track of when you're in a fight. But I like that reminder of let's keep it down. Like, let's remember this is a safe space. You know, it's like the DMZ. It's a chill area.
[00:15:22.810] 就像，你知道，就像小学时老师会在讲台前提醒大家降低音量，比如“如果能听到我说话就拍两下手”。但我同意你的说法。我觉得像音量或强度这种东西，在打架的时候很容易忽略。但我喜欢这种提醒，让我们保持安静。就像提醒大家这里是安全区。你知道，就像非军事区一样。这是一个可以放松的地方。
[00:15:53.850] I think for me, if I think back to my parents fighting, I must have seen and heard them fight when I was young, but I don't have any specific memories of it, actually. So it must have been rare or at the very least behind closed doors. However, I have heard my mom recount to me some of their legendary fights. And I'm just like, damn, the tea. And they sounded kind of intense.
[00:15:53.850] 我觉得，要说我爸妈吵架，我小时候肯定见过也听过，但其实没什么具体的记忆。所以他们吵架应该很少见，或者至少都是关起门来吵。不过，我妈倒是给我讲过一些他们吵架的“传奇”故事。我当时就想，我的天，这八卦也太劲爆了吧。听起来真是激烈极了。
[00:16:22.910] Maybe not in terms of yelling, but definitely in terms of topic. And to an extent, you know, when sometimes fights get to like, this is my deal breaker. And if you don't compromise on this, I'm gonna and then you threaten with potentially ending the relationship or, you know, other things like that. Yeah. So that is something that I don't do, actually, in my fighting. But sometimes I do think about that. I'm just like, damn, that's crazy.
[00:16:22.910] 或许不会大吼大叫，但肯定会在话题上有所分歧。你知道，有时候争吵会发展到这种程度，比如“这是我的底线，如果你不妥协，我就……”然后威胁要分手，或者其他类似的情况。是的。所以，实际上我不会在争吵中这么做。但有时候我确实会想到这些。我就会想，天哪，这太疯狂了。
[00:16:51.130] Because my parents don't come off in that way. I think like they don't come off as people who would fight like that. But knowing that they have that history. Yeah. Does make me think. But I do think that approach of keeping fights private and keeping it behind closed doors is very much what I believe in terms of relationship philosophy. Yes, I agree too.
[00:16:51.130] 因为我父母给人的感觉不是那样。我觉得他们不像会那样吵架的人。但知道他们有过那样的过往，确实让我深思。不过，我确实认为把争吵私下解决，关起门来处理，这种做法在人际关系理念上与我非常契合。是的，我也同意。
[00:17:14.650] But in the case of kids, what are your thoughts on keeping the conflict behind closed doors? Hmm. I honestly think that when we have kids, we would not fight in front of our kids if it was possible to control it. Because sometimes fights happen on the fly and you can't keep every fight private as much as you would want it to. But I think generally that is how we would approach it.
[00:17:14.650] 但对于孩子来说，你觉得把冲突控制在私下解决怎么样？嗯……说实话，我觉得如果可以控制的话，我们有了孩子之后肯定不会在孩子面前吵架。因为有时候争吵是突发的，你不可能每次都像你希望的那样把争吵完全保密。但我想，总的来说，我们会采取这种方式。
[00:17:43.150] Especially because I think when you have an only child, that child is very much like the only audience. There's no escaping it and you're kind of trapping them in that situation with you. Yeah. Versus maybe if they had a sibling or something, they could entertain themselves or whatnot. But I feel like if we were to have just an only child, it would be a lot of emotion just on that kid. That's true. But like, what if you think your conflict resolution tactics are very healthy?
[00:17:43.150] 尤其是我觉得，如果你只有独生子女，那孩子就相当于你唯一的观众。他们无处可逃，你就像把他们困在了那个情境里。是啊。如果他们有兄弟姐妹什么的，他们或许可以自己找乐子什么的。但我觉得，如果我们只有独生子女，那孩子身上就会承受太多的情绪压力。确实如此。但是，如果你觉得你解决冲突的方式很健康呢？
[00:18:12.870] I guess if it was like a small enough conflict, we would just try to like communicate with each other with the kid there. Yeah. But if it was something that was going to take longer than 10 minutes, you know, we would probably try to hold it for a more private time. I think that makes sense. I ask because I've heard a parent say, interestingly enough, to their now adult child, they're like, oh, I actually wish that maybe we argued a little more in front of you because then you would learn
[00:18:12.870] 我想如果只是小冲突，我们可能就会在孩子在场的情况下尝试沟通。是的。但如果冲突会持续超过十分钟，我们大概会找个更私密的时间来解决。我觉得这样比较合理。我这么问是因为我听过一位家长很有意思地对他们现在已经成年的孩子说，他们会说：“哦，我其实希望我们当初能多在你面前争吵几次，这样你就能学到更多了。”
[00:18:42.350] some like conflict resolution skills. That is interesting. But I think I can totally agree because sometimes the topics of what, you know, you're talking and discussing could be really complex and a lot for a kid to just like see. Maybe what they just get out of it is, oh my God, there's some sort of deal breaker. Yeah. But if it's just like day to day stuff, like you said, something pretty simple and they
[00:18:42.350] 有些人喜欢冲突解决技巧。这很有意思。但我完全同意，因为有时候，你谈论和讨论的话题可能非常复杂，对孩子来说信息量很大。他们可能只会觉得，天哪，这里面肯定有什么不可逾越的障碍。是的。但如果只是像你说的，一些日常琐事，一些很简单的事情，他们
[00:19:09.650] see like, oh, well, they've solved that really quickly and easily. Then that's like maybe a pro thing to see. I guess it is like a fine line, too, because my parents keeping all their fights behind closed doors meant that for a lot of my life, I was insulated from what they were fighting about. I didn't even know they had common themes in their fights, basically, because I had no viz on it. Yeah. There was a moment where something kind of serious happened in our family. It shook my parents to the core.
[00:19:09.650] 比如，你看，哦，他们解决得真快真轻松。那这或许算是专业人士的做法吧。我觉得这其中的分寸也很难把握，因为我父母总是把争吵藏在心里，这意味着在我生命的大部分时间里，我都对他们争吵的原因一无所知。我甚至不知道他们争吵的原因其实有共通之处，因为我根本无从知晓。是啊。我们家曾经发生过一件挺严重的事情，这件事深深地震撼了我的父母。
[00:19:38.730] So then they had a pretty big disagreement about something. And then it got to like a more serious stage, I guess. My dad called me and like told me, okay, you and your mom have this really big disagreement on something. So we just need some like time. Oh. Oh, essentially. Yeah. And he was just giving me like a heads up. But for me, I was like, I didn't even know you guys were fucking fighting.
[00:19:38.730] 所以他们俩因为某件事吵得很厉害。然后事情好像发展到了比较严重的地步。我爸给我打电话，说：“你和你妈因为某件事吵得很厉害，所以我们需要一些时间冷静一下。” 哦，差不多就是这样。他只是提前跟我说一声。但我当时想的是，我根本不知道你们俩在吵架。
[00:20:05.730] I had I thought you guys were, you know, sunshine and rainbows, the perfect parents hanging out and happy all the time. Like I didn't even know there was all this stuff going on. So I guess as the kid, in some ways, I was thankful of like, thanks for protecting me from seeing what was happening all this time. But in another sense, I was like, well, now you just dropped this whole bomb on me that I didn't even know was festering under the surface. I don't know what the balance is of like looping your kid in on like some things versus not.
[00:20:05.730] 我一直以为你们就像阳光和彩虹一样，是完美的父母，总是其乐融融。我根本不知道家里发生了这么多事。所以，作为孩子，从某种程度上来说，我很感激你们一直以来保护我，让我看不到那些事情。但从另一个角度来说，我又觉得，你们现在一下子给了我这么大的冲击，而我之前根本不知道这些事情一直潜藏在我内心深处。我不知道该如何把握分寸，既要让孩子了解一些事情，又要完全不告诉他们。
[00:20:35.690] But it just does make me think that there is a healthy balance. Like maybe you can't shield your kid from everything. Because otherwise, it may be a bigger shock later on. True. Because like, if you never experienced conflict as a kid, you might not even like recognize the concept of that. And then if you face it in your own life, you might not know what to do. True. I think you're right.
[00:20:35.690] 但这让我觉得，凡事都应该有个平衡点。比如，你不可能完全保护孩子不受任何影响。否则，以后可能会遭受更大的冲击。确实如此。因为如果你小时候从未经历过冲突，你可能根本无法理解冲突的概念。然后，当你自己遇到冲突时，你可能就不知道该怎么办了。没错。我觉得你说得对。
[00:21:01.730] It's like such a fine line because yeah, you probably don't want to get like your kid wrapped up in your issues with your partner, especially if it's just between you two. Yeah. But I can also see another angle where it's like, the kid is also part of the family. So then maybe they want to like be in the know of general family situations.
[00:21:01.730] 这其中的界限很微妙，因为你肯定不想让孩子卷入你和伴侣之间的矛盾，尤其如果只是你们两个人之间的问题。没错。但我也能理解另一种角度，孩子也是家庭的一份子。所以他们或许也想了解一些家庭的日常情况。
[00:21:26.630] But also like if they're so young, it's like, okay, well, I don't want to like taint you. Oh my God. I just remembered this thing my parents used to do. So like when they had smaller conflicts, bickering about something, they would talk about it in front of me. It just was these big things that they were shielding me from. But when I was younger, my parents would bicker. And then occasionally they would turn to me and be like, oh, Jisoo, like what do you think? Wait, that's so funny.
[00:21:26.630] 但感觉他们年纪还小，我就想，好吧，我不想带坏你。我的天哪。我突然想起我爸妈以前常做的事。比如他们之间发生一些小争执，比如为了什么事拌嘴，他们就会当着我的面说。他们只是把一些大事藏起来不让我知道。但我小时候，我爸妈也会拌嘴。然后偶尔他们会转过头来问我：“Jisoo，你怎么看？”等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:21:56.490] And then I would have to be fucking King Solomon. Like, okay. I mean, they wouldn't take me super seriously, but I would sometimes share my perspective on it. Yeah. And as I got older, they stopped doing it. But I remember when I was really young, I'd be like, please don't ask me this. You're like, why did my TV just turn and ask me questions? Yeah. I'm like, wait, they can see me back here. Oh my God. That's so funny. I think my parents were similar to yours though.
[00:21:56.490] 然后我就得扮演所罗门王。好吧。我的意思是，他们不会把我当回事，但我偶尔会分享一下我的看法。是啊。等我长大些，他们就不这么做了。但我记得我小时候，我会说，求求你别问我这个问题。你会想，为什么我的电视机突然转过来问我问题？是啊。我会说，等等，他们能看到我。我的天哪。太搞笑了。我觉得我父母跟你父母差不多。
[00:22:24.690] Like they tried not to argue in front of us for like big stuff. But as I mentioned, they can get intense and start yelling at each other. And then like, I can hear that shit. I think the funniest thing about that is that, you know, usually I'm in my room or something and then I hear something and I'm like, oh, is something going on? And then that makes me go out of my room. And then I realize, oh shoot, they're like arguing. But then it's like, you're already here.
[00:22:24.690] 他们尽量避免在我们面前因为大事争吵。但就像我刚才说的，他们有时候会情绪激动，开始互相吼叫。然后，我就能听到那些声音。我觉得最搞笑的是，你知道，通常我都在房间里，然后听到什么动静，就会想，哦，出什么事了吗？然后我就走出房间。然后我才意识到，哦，糟了，他们在吵架。但转念一想，反正我已经在这儿了。
[00:22:52.150] You came out of your room and you just sit there and like eavesdrop on their argument. I honestly don't even remember what their arguments were about. But I do remember, yeah, hearing about basically a deal breaker. And I was like, oh God, my parents are like not okay. And then I think I would ask them about it later. I'd be like, whoa, like if you guys separated, who would I go to?
[00:22:52.150] 你从房间里出来，就坐在那儿，偷听他们吵架。说实话，我都不记得他们吵什么了。但我记得，嗯，好像听到了什么不可挽回的事情。我当时就想，天哪，我爸妈肯定要崩溃了。然后我想我之后会问他们。我会说，哇，如果你们分手了，我该去哪儿？
[00:23:21.630] Well, I feel like that's a question that parents ask their kid, you know, like if mom and dad divorced, who would you go to? But you like flipped it on. Dude, honestly, I remember thinking as a kid, occasionally when my parents would fight, I would be like, oh my God, they're getting a fucking divorce. Yeah. I guess it's a lot for a small child to see. I think when I was a little bit older, like in high school, I would always have dinner with my parents. And then sometimes I would go back in early to study or something.
[00:23:21.630] 嗯，我觉得这应该是父母会问孩子的问题，比如，如果爸妈离婚了，你会跟谁走？但你却反过来问了。老兄，说真的，我记得小时候，偶尔爸妈吵架的时候，我就会想，我的天哪，他们要离婚了。是啊。我觉得这对小孩子来说信息量太大了。我想等我稍微大一点，比如上高中的时候，我总是会和爸妈一起吃晚饭。然后有时候我会提前回学校学习什么的。
[00:23:49.650] And then my parents would stay at the dinner table and chat. I remember once I came out for more food after studying and my dad was just alone at the dinner table, like all of the dishes were there. So I was like, huh, they didn't clean up the food. And I was like, oh, where's mom? And my dad looked at me sheepishly and was like, yeah, we got into like a bit of an argument because we were talking about politics. So she's inside in her room now. And I remember I sat down and I gave my dad relationship advice.
[00:23:49.650] 然后我爸妈就会留在餐桌旁聊天。我记得有一次我学习完出来要饭吃，发现我爸一个人坐在餐桌旁，碗筷都还在那里。我就想，咦，他们没收拾啊。然后我又问，妈呢？我爸不好意思地看了我一眼，说，是啊，我们因为聊政治吵了一架，她现在在房间里。我记得我坐下来，给了我爸一些感情方面的建议。
[00:24:17.190] It's actually, I guess as a kid, it's not so much relationship advice, but it's like, oh, I know mom and mom sometimes talks to me about how you piss her off. So don't do these things because I know it makes mom really mad. And my dad was just like, okay, you're right. I should go apologize. And then he got up and went to apologize. Wait, that's kind of cute. How old were you then? High school? Yeah, I must have been like a sophomore or junior.
[00:24:17.190] 其实，我觉得小时候与其说是恋爱建议，不如说是，哦，我知道妈妈，她有时候会跟我说我惹她生气了。所以别做这些事，因为我知道妈妈会很生气。然后我爸就说，好吧，你说得对。我应该去道歉。然后他就起身去道歉了。等等，这还挺可爱的。你当时多大了？高中？嗯，我当时应该是高二或者高三吧。
[00:24:46.750] But I remember in that moment, I was also just starting to talk to guys and whatnot at school. And I was thinking, even though they were married for like 25 years or something at the time, you can still have fights like that. You can still have arguments like that. Dang. I mean, I guess it just goes to show that kids do see a lot that maybe when you're a parent, you're sometimes too busy to see some stuff or you don't see the same perspective as like your grown child.
[00:24:46.750] 但我记得当时我也刚开始在学校跟男生聊天什么的。我就在想，就算他们当时结婚都25年了，还是会有那样的争吵，还是会有那样的争执。唉。我的意思是，这说明孩子们确实能看到很多东西，也许当了父母之后，有时候太忙了，看不到一些事情，或者看不到孩子长大后的想法。
[00:25:18.910] I guess also as a kid, you get kind of like an external viewpoint because you're not in your parents' relationship, but you're a part of the family. Yeah. You're kind of like their consultant, you know? So we talked a little bit about how when we were younger and maybe even now, sometimes we see our parents engage in conflict. Sometimes it's inevitable. So we'll kind of know, especially as we get older, like we'll kind of know what's going on with our parents a little bit.
[00:25:18.910] 我想，作为孩子，你会获得一种旁观者的视角，因为你虽然不身处父母的婚姻关系中，但你又是家庭的一份子。是的，你有点像他们的顾问，你知道吗？所以我们聊了一会儿，说我们小时候，甚至现在，有时会看到父母发生冲突。有时这是不可避免的。所以，我们，尤其是随着年龄的增长，会逐渐了解父母之间发生的事情。
[00:25:49.070] But in your own life, do you ever talk to like your family or even your friends about conflicts you have with your SO afterwards? I think when I was younger, I would talk about it all the time. And I don't know what exactly I was looking for. Like in some ways, maybe I was seeking validation that my point of view was valid and not super fucked up. In other ways, I was also seeking advice or like wanting to vent.
[00:25:49.070] 但你自己生活中，事后你会跟家人甚至朋友谈论你和伴侣之间的冲突吗？我觉得我年轻的时候总是会跟别人说这些。我也不知道我到底在寻求什么。也许在某种程度上，我是在寻求认同，证明我的观点是正确的，而不是完全错误。另一方面，我也可能是在寻求建议，或者只是想倾诉一下。
[00:26:17.210] But now that I am married and even the years before marriage, I see my relationship so differently. It's not just something that's happening in my life that is a source of conversation. It's like the one true partnership, you know, that to me is the highest priority in my life, probably. So then I don't like to talk about my conflicts with my partner unless it's like fully resolved afterwards.
[00:26:17.210] 但现在我结婚了，甚至包括婚前的那些年，我对婚姻的看法都完全不同了。它不再只是生活中一件可以和人谈论的事情，而更像是一种真正的伴侣关系，你知道吗？对我来说，这或许是我生命中最重要的事情。所以，除非问题彻底解决，否则我不太喜欢和伴侣谈论我们之间的冲突。
[00:26:46.270] Because to an extent, it was like drama and like gossip when I was younger. And then now if there is a serious conflict in my relationship, I have to get it resolved ASAP. It's like the number one thing in that moment. And then only afterwards can I like talk about it and laugh about it, you know? I think that's a good approach. Only when it can be a funny story later do you share it. But yeah, like in the heat of the moment, if you share it, you're really just ranting about your partner.
[00:26:46.270] 因为某种程度上，年轻的时候，这就像八卦和闹剧一样。而现在，如果我的感情中出现严重的冲突，我必须尽快解决。那才是当时最重要的事。只有事后我才能谈论它，才能笑着谈起它，你知道吗？我觉得这是个好方法。只有当它能成为以后的趣事时，你才会分享。但是，在情绪激动的时候，如果你分享出来，你其实只是在抱怨你的伴侣。
[00:27:15.810] And that could affect maybe even the way that they're perceived by your friends. Totally. There's been moments where I like brought up a conflict that I had with my SO. And talking to my friends did give me insight of like, oh, maybe he was thinking like this or, you know, they would have feedback or commentary that would make me see my relationship differently in a good way of like, okay, I'm understanding and processing this conflict, not just through my own perceived thoughts, but through like other perspectives.
[00:27:15.810] 这甚至可能会影响你的朋友对你的看法。确实如此。我曾经有过和伴侣发生冲突的经历。和朋友们聊过之后，我意识到，哦，也许他当时是这么想的，或者，他们的反馈和评论让我从不同的角度看待我们的关系，让我意识到，我不仅从自己的角度，也从其他人的角度去理解和处理这个冲突。
[00:27:45.530] So it's not to say it doesn't help sometimes. But now I feel like my relationship is so sacred. You know, it's like something to be protected. Yeah. So I don't like to actively talk about it. And I guess the other thing too is we don't have a lot of multi-day conflicts. Usually if I'm bringing it up, we like resolve it day of. If I'm talking to my friends about it, it's resolved anyways. I think I am similar to you in that approach. I think also in general, I'm kind of private.
[00:27:45.530] 所以并不是说它完全没用。但现在我觉得我们的关系非常神圣。你知道，就像需要保护的东西一样。是的。所以我不太喜欢主动谈论它。而且我觉得还有一点就是我们很少会发生持续好几天的冲突。通常如果我主动提起，我们当天就能解决。如果我和朋友聊起这件事，通常也都能解决。我觉得在这方面我和你很像。而且我觉得我总体上也比较注重隐私。
[00:28:15.310] I think it's almost iconic how people sometimes ask me like, oh, how are you and your boyfriend? And I'm like, good. Like, oh, that's it. But yeah, I think I've learned over the years the importance of keeping things private. Because at this point in a relationship, it's not just that you're keeping your own matters private. You're actually also responsible for another person's privacy.
[00:28:15.310] 我觉得人们有时会问我“你和你男朋友怎么样？”这种问题，简直成了经典。我只能回答“挺好的”，好像就这么简单。不过，这些年来我逐渐明白了保护隐私的重要性。因为到了恋爱的这个阶段，你不仅要保护自己的隐私，还要保护对方的隐私。
[00:28:45.630] And so when you talk about random conflicts and stuff, it can sometimes be, whether you realize it or not, in a way disrespectful to your partner because you're sharing information about them that they never said was okay maybe or like didn't know that you shared that. So I think it just naturally plays into how I'm usually a little more private about relationships and stuff in general.
[00:28:45.630] 所以，当你谈论一些零星的冲突之类的事情时，不管你是否意识到，这在某种程度上可能对你的伴侣不尊重，因为你分享了一些他们从未同意过或者根本不知道你会分享的信息。因此，我认为这自然而然地影响了我通常在感情方面比较注重隐私的习惯。
[00:29:11.890] It makes me wonder too, if there were way more serious conflicts in our relationships, would we feel compelled to bring it up more? Or would we feel compelled to keep it even more private? Because I feel like as a woman who is dating, sometimes safety is also an issue. And we're lucky to be insulated from that. But a lot of people aren't. So I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if that privacy thing has a certain limit that you hit.
[00:29:11.890] 这让我不禁思考，如果我们的关系中存在更严重的冲突，我们会不会更愿意提出来？还是会更倾向于保密？因为我觉得，作为一名恋爱中的女性，安全有时也是一个问题。我们很幸运能免受这种困扰，但很多人却并非如此。所以我也不知道。有时我在想，这种隐私是不是也存在一个界限，一旦超过这个界限就会失去。
[00:29:39.770] And then afterwards, you should try to share it if things get super serious and scary. But at the same time, I think when you're in that situation, maybe it's even harder to bring it up because it feels so serious. You don't want to just go spreading it to people. Yeah, that's so true. There's definitely a line somewhere. I guess a pro here is if you have a therapist or someone to talk to, then it's hopefully an
[00:29:39.770] 之后，如果情况变得非常严重和可怕，你应该试着说出来。但同时，我觉得当你身处那种境地时，也许更难开口，因为感觉太严重了。你不想随便把事情告诉别人。是啊，确实如此。肯定存在一个界限。我想，好处在于，如果你有心理咨询师或者可以倾诉的人，那么情况应该会好一些。
[00:30:08.570] unbiased third party who can help you process your emotions. Because I'm not going to lie, I do try my best to keep things pretty private. But dude, sometimes there's just the urge. And you're like holding yourself back. You're like, dude, I have some juicy ass shit we could talk about. Sometimes it's a good topic too, because maybe the conflict you're having is not that serious.
[00:30:08.570] 一个公正的第三方，可以帮你梳理情绪。说实话，我一直尽力保护自己的隐私。但兄弟，有时候就是忍不住想说。你得克制自己。你会想，兄弟，我这儿有好多劲爆的八卦可以聊。有时候这确实是个好话题，因为也许你遇到的冲突并没有那么严重。
[00:30:32.990] But the topic is like one that you would love to hear just various. Would you do this or would you do that kind of perspectives? But if it's still fresh, I don't want to vile up any feathers right now. I know you have to dry age your conflict so it's ready to be shared. You're like, so two years ago, me and my partner talked about this and we're finally ready to bring it to the public. Would you rather do this or would you rather do that?
[00:30:32.990] 但这个话题就像是那种你会很想听听各种不同观点的话题。你会选择这样做还是那样做？但如果这件事还很新鲜，我不想现在就火上浇油。我知道你需要把冲突沉淀一段时间，才能准备好分享。你会说，两年前我和我的伴侣讨论过这件事，现在我们终于准备好把它公之于众了。你会选择这样做还是那样做？
[00:31:02.670] Guys, hot off the press, two years ago. Because I'll definitely admit like when I was younger, I also love to talk to my friends about if conflict came up. Especially when we're even younger, back in like high school and stuff. If an issue came up, I feel like the go-to response is always like, I just break up with them. And you're like, yes, that's what I needed to hear. And now I can go do that.
[00:31:02.670] 伙计们，这是两年前刚发生的。因为我必须承认，年轻的时候，如果遇到冲突，我也喜欢和朋友们聊聊。尤其是在我们更年轻的时候，比如高中那会儿。如果出了问题，我觉得大家最直接的回答总是“我直接跟他们分手”。然后你就会想，对啊，我正需要听到这个。现在我也可以这么做了。
[00:31:32.170] Oh my god, I used to be so toxic back in the day. When a fight came up, I would always go to my girlfriends and be like, oh my god, can you believe he did this or said this or whatever? Your girlfriends always side with you, right? Yeah. Especially since I was sharing this out to my girlfriends when it was like hot off the press. Sometimes I would have to fight the urge to go back to my SO and be like, well, this girl said that, you know, she agreed and said that this was fucked up.
[00:31:32.170] 我的天哪，我以前真是太毒舌了。每次吵架，我都会去找闺蜜，跟她们说：“我的天哪，你敢信他做了什么、说了什么之类的？” 闺蜜们总是站在你这边，对吧？是啊。尤其是我把这些新鲜事儿都跟闺蜜们分享的时候，她们肯定更支持我。有时候我得努力克制住想回去跟我对象说“哎，那个女孩也这么说，她也觉得这事儿太扯淡了”的冲动。
[00:31:58.570] You know, this person said this and I'm not going to go as far as to say that. But look at what all these other people are saying about the conflict. And that's super fucked up, right? Because now you're involving people who are biased on your side, looping them into the fight, basically. So those are learnings that I have to like break away from. Dude, I just had a genius idea. Oh my god, what? You know how there's like court?
[00:31:58.570] 你知道，这个人说了这些话，我不会完全赞同。但看看其他人对这场冲突的看法。这简直糟透了，对吧？因为现在你把那些原本就站在你这边的人也拉进来了，基本上就是把他们卷入了这场争斗。所以，我必须摆脱这些影响。哥们儿，我突然想到一个绝妙的主意。我的天，什么？你知道有法庭这种东西吗？
[00:32:27.250] They should make some simpler version of that, where if couples, they just can't agree on something, they bring it to court. Oh my god. And then they hire five to ten unbiased people to come in. They hear both sides of the story and then they silently vote at the end. There's your result. If you really needed an audience or like external voters. Dude, that's so... And you each bring like your own witness.
[00:32:27.250] 他们应该搞个简化版的，比如夫妻俩如果对某件事意见不合，就诉诸法庭。我的天哪。然后他们再雇五到十个公正的旁听员。听取双方的说法，最后默默投票。结果就出来了。如果你真的需要旁听或者外部投票的话。老兄，这真是……而且你们每个人都可以带一个证人。
[00:32:58.970] I've low-key seen a version of this happen online where sometimes people will post a long, detailed account of their relationship and their problems on this Korean website. All the comments are like, oh my god, I feel so bad for you. You should dump this person. These are like red flags. And then that person's SO will also post their own account and be like, you know, I saw that my partner posted this about us and here's all the things they got wrong and didn't mention.
[00:32:58.970] 我在网上隐约见过类似的情况，有些人会在韩国网站上发布一篇长篇大论，详细描述他们的感情经历和问题。评论里全是“我的天哪，我真为你感到难过。你应该甩了这个人。”之类的。这些评论简直就是危险信号。然后，对方的伴侣也会发帖反驳，说：“我看到我伴侣发帖说了我们之间的事，以下是他/她所有说错和没提到的地方。”
[00:33:28.570] And then all the comments under them will be like, oh my god, now I'm seeing that the other person was so biased, blah, blah, blah. And then there's like a mini like internet fight between the posts. Dude, that's so funny. I guess it's also like r slash relationships. Yeah, true. I think the funny ones are the ones where someone posts. You can also sometimes tell when it's like really biased and they're like trying to check themselves so they add like a sentence or two about...
[00:33:28.570] 然后下面的评论就会变成“我的天哪，现在我才发现对方有多么偏袒，等等等等”。然后帖子之间就会爆发一场小小的网络骂战。老兄，这太搞笑了。我觉得这有点像r/relationships论坛。对，没错。我觉得最搞笑的是那些有人发帖的时候。有时候你也能看出他们是不是真的有偏见，然后他们好像在试图自我辩解，所以会加一两句话……
[00:33:57.070] To be fair, like this is what my SO did or said. Right. They're trying to get like pity points or empathy points from the audience and then all the comments are like, you fucked up. You're narcissistic or something. Because I feel like Reddit commenters will always jump to like the highest, most dramatic conclusion or something. It's never just like, you're being a little selfish right now. It's like you have narcissistic personality disorder. Yeah.
[00:33:57.070] 说实话，我对象确实做了或说了类似的话。没错。他们想博取观众的同情或同情，结果评论全是“你搞砸了”、“你自恋”之类的。因为我觉得Reddit上的评论者总是会跳到最极端、最戏剧化的结论。他们从来不会说“你现在有点自私”，而是会说“你得了自恋型人格障碍”。是啊。
[00:34:23.870] So maybe my core idea wouldn't work because then it would just become a bigger argument with people behind you. I like that though. That would be peak entertainment and like great TV. True. Maybe it could be a TV show. Yeah. Well, to close today's episode out, I want to end on a note of resolution. So for you in your relationship and in your conflicts with your partner, what are you looking for when you go into a fight or a conflict?
[00:34:23.870] 所以，也许我的核心想法行不通，因为那样只会演变成一场更大的争论，而且你身后还会有更多人加入。不过我喜欢这样。那会是娱乐的巅峰，就像精彩的电视节目一样。没错。也许可以拍成电视节目。是啊。好了，今天的节目就到此为止，我想以一个解决方案来结束。那么，对于你和伴侣的关系，以及你们之间的冲突，当你们发生争吵或冲突时，你们在寻求的是什么呢？
[00:34:53.870] What do you think would satisfy you and qualify as a resolution to you? I need my partner to bow down and be like, dude, you're so right. You're never wrong. Thank you. Just kidding. Maybe. But realistically, I think the sort of resolution that I'm looking for generally is that both of us now understand each other better.
[00:34:53.870] 你觉得什么样的结果才能让你满意，才能算作你心目中的完美解决方案？我需要我的伴侣彻底臣服，然后说：“兄弟，你说得太对了。你永远不会错。谢谢你。”开玩笑啦。也许吧。但说实话，我真正想要的解决方案，其实是我们俩现在都能更好地理解彼此。
[00:35:22.450] Because sometimes bringing up conflict is not necessarily about changing behavior, but it's more about understanding why did this happen? Or why did someone act a certain way? What is the perspective behind it? If I understand the why, then it's easier, I think, to either let it go or maybe even change my opinion on the matter.
[00:35:22.450] 因为有时候提出冲突并不一定是为了改变行为，而更多的是为了理解事情发生的原因？或者某人为什么会那样做？背后的原因是什么？如果我理解了原因，那么我认为就更容易放下这件事，甚至改变我对这件事的看法。
[00:35:49.230] So I think that's like the biggest thing, understanding each other more. And then ideally, if there's some way to have an action item after, I guess, not to get all corporate. But I think it's nice to hear if someone on either side has a plan for moving forward. Like, oh, okay, I understand that you do whatever this certain way.
[00:35:49.230] 所以我觉得最重要的是增进彼此了解。理想情况下，如果之后能有个行动方案就更好了，当然，我不想搞得太正式。但我觉得如果双方都有推进计划，那就更好了。比如，“哦，好的，我明白你们是按这个方式做的。”
[00:36:15.330] So now that I know that, I won't bother you anymore about it because I understand better. Or it's like, oh, okay, I understand doing this bothers you. So I will try to do it less. Yeah. I think the action item matters a lot to me too, though. As much as we joke about it sounding corporate. Yeah.
[00:36:15.330] 既然我知道了，我就不会再为此烦你了，因为我理解得更透彻了。或者说，哦，好吧，我知道这样做会让你觉得烦。所以我以后会尽量少做。嗯。不过，我觉得这件事本身对我来说也很重要。尽管我们经常开玩笑说这听起来像官僚作风。嗯。
[00:36:34.770] I want to know that on either side, there is something that can be like optimized or like an improvement that can happen that would just make the other person happier or generally improve your quality of life. I think something that I've been thinking about recently is you can be with someone for a very long time. But at the end of the day, you're not a mind reader. Neither of you are.
[00:36:34.770] 我想知道，无论哪一方，是否存在可以优化或改进的地方，从而让对方更快乐，或者从整体上提升彼此的生活质量。我最近一直在思考的一点是，你可以和一个人相处很久，但归根结底，你不是读心术士，你们俩都不是。
[00:36:58.010] So if there's something that bugs either one of you, and it can be resolved by talking about it, I feel like that is always good to kind of bring up. A new learning for me too is the flip side of that, which is just because something bothers you doesn't mean you have to bring it up. As backward as that sounds. Learning to kind of pick and choose your battles and learning what to accept, what to bring up is also a fine art and a skill too.
[00:36:58.010] 所以，如果你们其中任何一方有什么烦心事，而且可以通过沟通解决，我觉得提出来总是好的。对我来说，最近学到的还有另一面，那就是即使某件事让你烦恼，也不意味着你必须把它说出来。这听起来可能有点矛盾。学会选择性地处理问题，学会接受什么、提出什么，也是一门艺术，一种技巧。
[00:37:26.970] Having conflicts that are productive, I would say, is a resolution to me. Yeah. No, I agree. Because like you don't want to bring it up just to argue or something. Yeah. And I think oftentimes maybe that's what it is. It's like, how can your relationship as a unit gain more clarity, forge a path forward instead of just harping on things that you can't change or like things that happened in the past, right? Right. Exactly. Wow. Are we masters of conflict? We just explained relationship.
[00:37:26.970] 我认为，如果冲突能够产生建设性，那对我来说就是一种解决方案。是的。没错，我同意。因为你不想无缘无故地挑起争端。是的。而且我觉得很多时候，问题可能就出在这里。就像是，你们的关系如何才能更加清晰，如何才能找到前进的方向，而不是纠结于那些无法改变的事情，或者过去发生的事情，对吧？对。正是如此。哇。我们难道是处理冲突的高手吗？我们刚才居然解释了什么是关系。
[00:37:58.070] Yeah, I think everything we talked about was pretty insightful. Conflict is such a touchy subject sometimes. So I'm glad that we took the time to kind of talk through our own thoughts and understandings of dealing with conflict in relationships. So thank you for talking through all of this with me, Jisoo.
[00:37:58.070] 是的，我觉得我们聊的所有内容都很有启发性。冲突有时确实是个很敏感的话题。所以我很高兴我们能花时间好好聊聊，梳理一下我们各自对处理人际关系中冲突的看法和理解。谢谢你跟我聊了这么多，智秀。
