[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. Before we get into our topic today, I have a story to share. I guess it's kind of relevant to one of our previous episodes where we talked about how old we feel we are.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。在正式开始今天的话题之前，我想先分享一个故事。我觉得这和我们之前一期节目里讨论的“我们觉得自己有多大”有点关系。
[00:00:27.090] As I've mentioned before, I am living at home with my parents right now. And the bed that I've been sleeping in is the bed that I've had since like, I don't know, junior high maybe?
[00:00:27.090] 正如我之前提到的，我现在和父母住在一起。我一直睡的这张床，大概从初中开始就一直用到现在了。
[00:00:39.970] It's an old bed basically. I decided to make some changes, partially because I wanted to move my bed so that I can see my TV straight on in my room. Priorities. Yeah. And then also partially
[00:00:39.970] 基本上就是一张旧床。我决定做一些改动，部分原因是我想挪一下床的位置，这样我就可以在房间里正对着电视了。这就是优先事项。嗯。还有一部分原因是
[00:00:56.930] because there's this meme that I saw before that basically says you're not a true adult until your bed is in the middle of your room. Oh my god. So I got a new bed, and I dismantled my old bed
[00:00:56.930] 因为我之前看到过一个梗图，大意是说只有把床放在房间正中央，你才算真正长大成人。我的天哪。所以我买了张新床，然后把旧床拆了。
[00:01:12.130] and I put the new bed in the middle of my room so that I can see my TV clearly. I guess that is a very adult thing. I never thought about it that way. But I just remember a couple days ago,
[00:01:12.130] 我把新床放在房间中央，这样就能清楚地看到电视。我想这真是个很成人化的做法。我以前从没这么想过。但我突然想起几天前，
[00:01:22.370] we hopped on a video call to talk about some podcast stuff. And I saw that you had your new bed, your bedroom looked a little different. And the first thing I asked you was, where did you put
[00:01:22.370] 我们视频通话聊了聊播客的事。我看到你换了新床，卧室看起来有点不一样了。我问你的第一件事就是，你把床放哪儿了？
[00:01:31.810] your stuffed animals? Because Crystal used to have so many like stuffed animals on her bed. And I was just like, where did they all go? But you immediately found a new home for them.
[00:01:31.810] 你的毛绒玩具呢？因为克丽丝塔尔以前床上摆着好多毛绒玩具。我就想，它们都去哪儿了？结果你马上就给它们找到了新家。
[00:01:41.730] For most of them. But there's still like a bunch that I'm not too sure what to do with them yet. I'll have to like sort through it. Because I feel like there's some that are like constant
[00:01:41.730] 大部分都处理好了。但还有一些我还没想好该怎么处理。我得好好整理一下。因为我觉得有些东西好像一直都……
[00:01:52.850] rotation on the bed, you know? But some of them are like kind of old now. And I'm like, is it time to move on? Oh, but it's so sad. I feel like every stuffed animal has such a specific
[00:01:52.850] 你知道，它们会在床上轮换着放。但有些现在已经很旧了。我就想，是不是该换新的了？唉，真是太可惜了。我觉得每个毛绒玩具都有它独特的意义。
[00:02:04.210] memory associated with them. Like I threw out a bunch when my parents moved to Korea. To this day, I'm still like, maybe I should have kept some of it. Oh, I'm still deciding. So we'll see.
[00:02:04.210] 与它们相关的回忆。比如我父母搬去韩国的时候，我扔掉了一大堆。直到今天，我仍然会想，也许我应该留下一些。哦，我还在考虑。所以，到时候再说吧。
[00:02:14.610] TBD. Indeed. I don't really have a story this week. But I guess just like a mini life update. A couple weeks ago, two weeks ago, almost exactly actually, we went to Miami on my Bachelorette
[00:02:14.610] 待定。确实如此。这周我没什么特别的故事要讲。不过，就简单汇报一下近况吧。大概两周前，差不多就是两周前，我们去迈阿密参加了我的《单身女郎》节目。
[00:02:28.930] trip. It was actually like a joint Bachelor Bachelorette trip. And it was a ton of people, a ton of fun, super crazy weekend. But basically, since we got back, my voice has been not the same.
[00:02:28.930] 那次旅行，其实就像是《单身汉》和《单身女郎》的联合旅行。人很多，玩得很开心，周末过得超级疯狂。但基本上，自从回来之后，我的嗓子就跟以前不一样了。
[00:02:42.130] And it's crazy because the first week that we were back, my voice was gone. So even more shot than it is right now. But like bodily I felt okay. It was more just like, I sounded so hoarse,
[00:02:42.130] 这很疯狂，因为我们复工的第一周，我的嗓子完全哑了。比现在还要糟糕。但身体上我感觉还好。只是声音特别沙哑。
[00:02:53.170] basically. And then, you know, when the weekend came, I was like, Oh, thank God, like I didn't get sick or anything. And it was just like my voice, hopefully my voice heals in time for the
[00:02:53.170] 基本上就是这样。然后，你知道，到了周末，我就想，哦，谢天谢地，我没生病什么的。只是我的嗓子，希望我的嗓子能及时恢复，赶上……
[00:03:02.130] wedding, which is now in about three weeks or so. Oh, God. And then literally the day after me thinking this, I got sick. So I kind of have a cough and the cough is really the only symptom
[00:03:02.130] 婚礼还有大约三周就要举行了。天哪。就在我想到这件事的第二天，我就病倒了。我有点咳嗽，咳嗽是唯一的症状。
[00:03:14.930] like everything else is normal. So I guess I kind of jinxed myself there a little bit by being too optimistic. Hopefully, it works out. Hopefully, it's better to get sick now than closer to the
[00:03:14.930] 一切都像往常一样。所以我想我有点儿因为太乐观而给自己带来了霉运。希望一切顺利。希望现在生病总比临近预产期生病要好。
[00:03:26.850] wedding. That's true. I'm getting it out of the way. Basically, you have three weeks to heal. I'm sure it's doable. All right, well, let's get to the topic at hand for this week. Work insecurities. I feel like we've talked in the past briefly about imposter syndrome,
[00:03:26.850] 婚礼。没错。我先把它说完。基本上，你有三周时间恢复。我相信肯定没问题。好了，那我们来谈谈这周的主题：职场不安全感。我觉得我们之前好像简单地聊过冒名顶替综合症，
[00:03:47.010] which we'll probably talk more about today again. But there are also other insecurities at work that you know, aren't necessarily specifically related to performance. Now that we've been working for a while, we thought it would be interesting to chat a little bit about our work
[00:03:47.010] 我们今天可能还会再详细讨论一下这个问题。但工作中还有其他一些不安全感，你知道，这些不安全感并不一定与业绩直接相关。现在我们已经工作了一段时间，所以我们觉得聊聊我们的工作会很有意思。
[00:04:05.490] insecurities. And I think this episode and this topic specifically will probably be a little bit more on the vulnerable side. I always find it a little bit difficult to really share
[00:04:05.490] 不安全感。我觉得这一集，尤其是这个话题，可能会让我更坦诚地谈及自己的脆弱一面。我总是觉得很难真正地分享这些。
[00:04:16.930] about the challenges that I face at work because one like this like a public platform so anyone can kind of listen in. But also it's just one of those things where to an extent work is kind
[00:04:16.930] 关于我在工作中面临的挑战，因为像这样的平台就像一个公共平台，任何人都可以旁听。但同时，在某种程度上，工作也是一种……
[00:04:27.890] of a reflection of your skills or like that's how my mindset is sometimes and it doesn't necessarily reflect my character. But to an extent, I think it does represent some aspect of myself. So you
[00:04:27.890] 这或许反映了你的技能，或者说，这有时就是我的想法，但这并不一定反映我的性格。但在某种程度上，我认为它确实代表了我自身的某些方面。所以你
[00:04:39.570] know, it's, of course difficult to talk about the things that make us insecure about this. So hopefully you guys can sort of relate to our experiences and whatnot. As we talk through our
[00:04:39.570] 当然，要谈论那些让我们感到不安的事情是很困难的。所以，希望你们能在某种程度上理解我们的经历等等。当我们谈论……
[00:04:49.330] insecurities about work. Totally agree. I feel like also because work is such a big part of our lives. A lot of things happen at work. And I think it's just a very possible for a lot of insecurities to
[00:04:49.330] 对工作的不安全感。完全同意。我觉得这也跟工作在我们生活中占据如此重要的位置有关。工作中会发生很多事情。我认为很多不安全感都可能源于此。
[00:05:04.610] therefore come up as well, whether you realize it sometimes or not. But sometimes I feel like it can be a bit subconscious as well. I guess to start us off though, do you have any general work insecurities
[00:05:04.610] 因此，无论你是否意识到，这些想法都会不时出现。但有时我觉得它也可能是一种潜意识的行为。不过，首先我想问问，你在工作中是否存在任何不安全感？
[00:05:19.170] that you can think of off the top of your head? So I do and I guess this is probably a fairly broad one that might encompass a lot of, you know, smaller work insecurities. But I think one of the
[00:05:19.170] 你脑海里能立刻想到的是什么？我确实想到了，而且我觉得这可能是一个相当宽泛的问题，可能涵盖了很多，你知道的，工作中较小的不安全感。但我认为其中之一是……
[00:05:30.290] thoughts that I tend to have is, oh, I'm not doing something enough or I'm not good enough or I'm not fast enough or, you know, all these things that kind of come back to my lack of skill set or maybe
[00:05:30.290] 我经常会想，哦，我做得不够好，或者我不够优秀，或者我不够快，或者，你知道，所有这些都归结于我技能不足，或者也许
[00:05:43.490] something missing in my work ethic or my character that makes me a bad worker. And it kind of makes me think actually, because if there's something that I've kind of seen and learned in the last
[00:05:43.490] 我的职业道德或性格中是不是缺少了什么，导致我工作能力差。这其实让我有点思考，因为如果我在过去一段时间里看到和学到了什么……
[00:05:56.930] five years or so of working, it's that there's no one archetype of a good worker. So I kind of feel like back in school, there was like that archetype of a good student. Maybe it could be divided into
[00:05:56.930] 工作五年左右，我发现并没有一个固定的优秀员工形象。这让我想起学生时代，那时似乎存在一个优秀学生的典型形象。或许可以将其细分为……
[00:06:10.690] like the naturally smart person and like the super hard worker, but that was kind of the extent, right? It's just like two types of people. But I think in the workplace, there's so many different
[00:06:10.690] 就像天资聪颖的人和超级努力的人一样，但也就仅限于此了，对吧？好像只有两种人。但我觉得在职场上，人的类型就丰富得多。
[00:06:20.210] skill sets that make someone a beneficial partner or a beneficial employee in the workplace, depending on like what job you are, or maybe even if you're like a manager or like an individual contributor. So there's no true this is like the perfect worker definition, I guess. But
[00:06:20.210] 使一个人成为职场中有益的合作伙伴或员工的技能组合，取决于你的职位，甚至取决于你是经理还是普通员工。所以，我想并没有一个真正意义上的完美员工定义。
[00:06:38.210] maybe I'm just used to like that school rubric grading system where I'm like, okay, maybe I'm on the worker scale, like a B or whatever, like some sort of like average grade. And I'm like,
[00:06:38.210] 也许我只是习惯了学校那种评分标准，在那种标准里，我会想，好吧，也许我的表现属于中等水平，比如B之类的，总之就是个平均分。然后我就想，
[00:06:47.970] why am I not like an excelling worker? Interesting. So you like kind of internally grade yourself? I think so. And if there's certain things that don't meet what I think is a quality of like
[00:06:47.970] 为什么我没能成为一名优秀的员工？有意思。所以你会在心里给自己打分？我想是的。如果有些事情达不到我心目中优秀员工的标准，比如……
[00:07:02.450] the ideal worker, then I like judge myself very harshly. Oh my god. And I asked like what the ideal worker is. I think it's someone who's always on kind of like work is life. To me,
[00:07:02.450] 如果要问理想的员工是什么样的，那我就会对自己非常苛刻。天哪。然后我就问自己，理想的员工到底是什么样的。我觉得就是那种永远在线，把工作当成生活的人。对我来说，
[00:07:16.530] that is like a plus worker, someone who puts work above like other aspects of life. I guess just in my daily life, it's very hard for me to think that way. Like yes, I find aspects of
[00:07:16.530] 那就像那种超级员工，把工作看得比生活的其他方面都重要。我觉得在我的日常生活中，很难那样想。是的，我发现某些方面……
[00:07:26.610] work important. And I do understand certain things are priorities and stuff. But at the end of the day, like work is work to me. I know to some people, the performance of the company is directly
[00:07:26.610] 工作很重要。我也明白有些事情是优先事项之类的。但说到底，对我来说，工作就是工作。我知道对有些人来说，公司的业绩直接取决于……
[00:07:37.410] tied to like how they see the performance of their life or like, you know, like different positions kind of hinge more on like the company's performance and stuff like that. Yeah, I guess just it's hard
[00:07:37.410] 这跟他们如何看待自己的人生表现有关，或者说，你知道，不同的职位往往更取决于公司的业绩等等。是啊，我觉得这很难。
[00:07:46.610] for me to think that way. So then when I see people who are super committed, responding to emails at 11pm taking late night meetings, early morning calls even more than I feel like I do, that I'm
[00:07:46.610] 对我来说，那样想是不对的。所以，当我看到那些超级敬业的人，晚上11点还在回复邮件，开到深夜的会议，甚至比我做得还多，早上还要早起打电话时，我就会觉得……
[00:07:57.730] like, oh, this person is legit. They are like the worker, the teammate that someone wants to have. I see. Whoa. In a way, I can relate to that a bit where when I see someone working late,
[00:07:57.730] 就像，哦，这个人真靠谱。他们是那种人人都想拥有的员工和队友。我明白了。哇。某种程度上，我也有同感，当我看到有人加班到很晚时，
[00:08:11.970] just off hours, I guess, the thought definitely creeps up like, oh, should I be doing this too? If they're doing it, but I also be doing this. And hopefully that makes me look good. You know,
[00:08:11.970] 我想，大概是在下班的时候，这种想法肯定会冒出来，比如，哦，我也应该做这件事吗？如果他们都在做，那我也应该做这件事。希望这样能让我看起来不错。你知道，
[00:08:24.530] like a really hard worker, as you mentioned, the ideal worker or whatever. But realistically, when I think about that, I'm like, I don't know if I have the willpower to work those extra hours
[00:08:24.530] 就像你说的，像个非常努力的员工，理想的员工什么的。但说实话，仔细想想，我就觉得，我不知道自己有没有毅力去加班。
[00:08:37.810] when it's not needed, necessarily. But I do think it's like inevitable because it kind of makes you compare yourself. Initially, I was gonna say especially if it's someone who is higher up than
[00:08:37.810] 有时候没必要，但我觉得这几乎是不可避免的，因为它会让你不由自主地与他人比较。一开始我想说，尤其当比较对象是比你职位高的人时，更是如此。
[00:08:49.650] you. But now that I think about it, it could go both ways. Because if it's someone on your level two, then you're like, oh, shoot, that's like a direct comparison. Someone on my level is going
[00:08:49.650] 你。但现在想想，情况可能反过来也一样。因为如果对方是和你水平差不多的人，你就会想，哎呀，这简直就是直接比较。但如果对方和我水平差不多，那就另当别论了。
[00:09:00.690] above and beyond, should I be trying to replicate that? And then if it's like a manager or just someone higher than you, then it's kind of like, oh, shoot, like that person's going above and
[00:09:00.690] 如果对方做得更好，我是否应该尝试效仿？如果对方是经理或者比你级别高的人，那就有点让人觉得，哎呀，这个人做得太好了。
[00:09:11.890] beyond. That's probably how they got to their level by like doing all this. That makes sense. It's kind of like if they're already a higher level than you, then they become like the role model. But if they're your peer, then maybe they're like your competition a little bit.
[00:09:11.890] 超越。他们大概就是通过做这些努力才达到现在的水平。这很合理。如果他们的水平已经比你高，那他们就成了你的榜样。但如果他们是你的同龄人，那他们可能在某种程度上算是你的竞争对手。
[00:09:27.650] And I feel like that is, of course, like a very common insecurity, like competition. And then comparing yourself with your co-workers or even just with what you think you should be doing. I think I experienced that kind of insecurity a lot more in the past when I had
[00:09:27.650] 我觉得这当然是一种很常见的不安全感，就像竞争一样。你会拿自己和同事比较，甚至拿自己和自己认为应该做到的事情比较。我觉得我过去经历这种不安全感的时候更多。
[00:09:48.450] co-workers who did similar things as me. So I think I had a really bad case of imposter syndrome back then because my co-workers basically did the same thing as me. We just worked on separate projects
[00:09:48.450] 同事们和我做着类似的事情。所以我觉得我当时患上了很严重的冒名顶替综合症，因为我的同事们基本上和我做着同样的事情。我们只是负责不同的项目。
[00:10:02.850] and I would always look at their project and be like, oh, shoot, this is like infinitely better than mine. But like looking back, I don't think it was ever an issue. It was never like a complaint,
[00:10:02.850] 我总是会看看他们的项目，然后想，哎呀，这比我的好太多了。但现在回想起来，我觉得这从来都不是问题。这从来都不是抱怨。
[00:10:14.770] like, oh, you need to step up your game and do what this person is doing. Nothing of that sort ever came up. If anything, like maybe to the untrained eye, our work looks similar. But to me,
[00:10:14.770] 比如，哦，你需要加把劲，像这个人一样去做。从来没有人这么说过。如果非要说有什么相似之处，可能在不了解内情的人看来，我们的作品很像。但对我来说，
[00:10:31.010] because I'm kind of in the design industry and I've seen a lot of stuff, I'm just like, oh, shoot, these things this guy did better. This project overall is like better in whatever way. But yeah, ultimately all that worry led to nothing.
[00:10:31.010] 因为我身处设计行业，见多识广，所以我会想，哎呀，这家伙在某些方面做得更好。这个项目整体来说，在各个方面都更胜一筹。但最终，所有的担忧都是多余的。
[00:10:45.410] Dude, it's interesting that you say that because I can definitely relate to that internal freak out and maybe not so much like a freak out, but it's just like a constant
[00:10:45.410] 兄弟，你说得真有意思，因为我完全能理解那种内心的恐慌，或许与其说是恐慌，不如说是一种持续不断的焦虑。
[00:10:54.770] recurring thought that is sort of hard to suppress. But sometimes when I look back at times where I was comparing myself to someone or I guess like being more conscious than I need to about someone
[00:10:54.770] 一个挥之不去的念头。有时候回想过去，我会不自觉地拿自己和别人比较，或者说，我会过度在意别人。
[00:11:06.690] in particular, I realized it's like all in my head. No one had ever made me feel like, oh, we should be competition for each other or no one was ever truly comparing us. But the mental block was just so hard to remove.
[00:11:06.690] 我尤其意识到，这一切都只是我自己的臆想。从来没有人让我觉得我们应该互相竞争，也从来没有人真正把我们放在一起比较。但这种心理障碍却很难消除。
[00:11:20.130] Dude, yeah. I think that was when I truly understood imposter syndrome because I would actually think, oh, they're going to figure out soon. Like when is it coming? The moment when they realize I'm a fraud. Shit.
[00:11:20.130] 兄弟，是啊。我觉得那时候我才真正理解了冒名顶替综合症，因为我会想，哦，他们很快就会发现的。到底什么时候会发现？他们意识到我是个骗子的那一刻。妈的。
[00:11:35.650] Where I'd be like, oh my God, like that moment is coming soon. They're going to realize they hired, they made a mistake in their hiring basically. But you know, that moment never came. And actually
[00:11:35.650] 我当时会想，天哪，那一刻很快就要来了。他们会意识到他们招错了人，基本上就是招错了人。但你知道，那一刻从未到来。实际上
[00:11:47.090] on the contrary, my manager put in a good recommendation for me and then that's how I got my current job. So if anything, only good things happened even though I was like so stuck in that imposter syndrome phase, I guess.
[00:11:47.090] 相反，我的经理为我写了一封很好的推荐信，我才得到了现在这份工作。所以，尽管我当时深陷于“冒名顶替综合症”的泥潭，但最终一切都朝着好的方向发展了。
[00:12:01.890] That's interesting to me because to an extent, I wonder how much of this is like our age. We've talked about how we sometimes feel a little bit self-conscious about being on the younger
[00:12:01.890] 这让我很感兴趣，因为在某种程度上，我想知道这和我们这个年龄段的情况有多相似。我们之前也聊过，有时候我们会因为自己年纪小而感到有点不自在。
[00:12:11.490] side at work. And, you know, when you're younger and more used to school than you are to work, for example, it's kind of like you're pretending to be an employee of a company because you don't
[00:12:11.490] 在工作中扮演着不同的角色。你知道，当你年轻的时候，更习惯于学校生活而不是工作，比如，这有点像你在假装自己是公司的员工，因为你并不……
[00:12:22.130] fully know how the system works yet. But I can also kind of see that maybe every single time you move companies or maybe if you do like a horizontal shift from like one team to another, I can totally see someone having imposter syndrome even if they're older.
[00:12:22.130] 虽然我对这套系统运作方式还不太了解，但我也能理解，每次换公司，或者像从一个团队调到另一个团队这种横向调动，即使是年纪较大的人，也可能会感到自己像个冒名顶替者。
[00:12:38.370] So it's interesting. Like, I wonder at what level of experience you're kind of like, okay, I am fully entitled to this job and to this role and you're not like doubting yourself constantly. Oh God, never. I will say though that as I mentioned, like good things happened
[00:12:38.370] 所以这很有意思。比如，我很好奇，你得积累到什么程度的经验才能让你觉得，“好吧，我完全胜任这份工作和这个角色”，而不会一直怀疑自己。哦，天哪，绝对不会。不过，就像我刚才提到的，好事发生了。
[00:12:57.250] despite my imposter syndrome. I didn't really attribute it to my work. I think like actually the first thought that came to mind was like, oh maybe my manager or like team members liked my personality. And I was like, maybe that's how like these good things happened or whatever,
[00:12:57.250] 尽管我患有冒名顶替综合症，但我并没有真正把它归咎于我的工作。我想，我脑海中浮现的第一个念头其实是，哦，也许我的经理或者团队成员喜欢我的个性。然后我就想，也许这就是这些好事发生的原因之类的。
[00:13:21.250] which is kind of funny because that's what I'm insecure about right now in my current job. I'm like super insecure about, oh am I like not interesting to my co-workers? Do they like me?
[00:13:21.250] 这其实挺搞笑的，因为这正是我现在在工作中感到不自信的地方。我特别没安全感，不知道我的同事们是不是觉得我无趣？他们喜欢我吗？
[00:13:35.490] These kinds of things. And I think part of it is because I joined this team during COVID, so we had less in-person interactions until more recently. And then also an interesting change was
[00:13:35.490] 诸如此类的事情。我认为部分原因是我在新冠疫情期间加入这个团队，所以直到最近我们才开始有更多面对面的交流。此外，还有一个有趣的改变是……
[00:13:48.210] I have more introverts on my team now, but before I had more extroverts. And so I think now that the introvert energy is stronger, it just kind of feels like it takes slightly longer and extra
[00:13:48.210] 现在我的团队里内向的人比较多，但以前外向的人比较多。所以我觉得现在内向的能量更强了，感觉做事需要的时间稍微长一些，也需要付出更多。
[00:14:02.690] push for the team to like get to know each other. Yeah, for a while I really grappled with that as an insecurity as well. Dude, yeah. The social aspect of work is actually such a big stress. Sometimes I almost feel like
[00:14:02.690] 鼓励团队成员互相了解。是啊，有一段时间我也为此感到很没安全感。兄弟，没错。工作中的社交方面压力真的很大。有时候我几乎感觉自己
[00:14:15.810] it's a bigger stress than the work itself because to an extent like work can be evaluated in an objective way, but getting along with your co-workers or befriending them, sometimes it's sheer luck. Oh, the timing didn't work out. Or by the time I joined, these people were already
[00:14:15.810] 这比工作本身更让人压力山大，因为工作在某种程度上可以客观评价，但与同事相处融洽或成为朋友，有时纯粹靠运气。唉，时机不对。或者等我加入的时候，这些人已经……
[00:14:31.410] paired up or friends or whatnot. So I totally know what you mean. I think one of the things that I feel when I'm at work is I think in terms of some of my social insecurities,
[00:14:31.410] 搭档、朋友什么的。所以我完全明白你的意思。我觉得我在工作时感受到的其中一点就是，我会想到我的一些社交不安全感，
[00:14:43.570] sometimes I just have this very irrational fear that everyone hates me. And this isn't actually just work related. This is just like, I think my general anxieties about the world existing in society. When someone doesn't smile or someone doesn't say hi internally, I'm sometimes like,
[00:14:43.570] 有时候我会莫名其妙地害怕每个人都讨厌我。这其实不只是工作上的事，而是我对社会存在的普遍焦虑。当别人不微笑或者不跟我打招呼时，我内心有时会想：
[00:15:01.010] okay, yeah, they hate me. And I think just being in a smaller company, the social web of it all is a little bit more intricate than maybe at a bigger company where it's easier to be anonymous.
[00:15:01.010] 好吧，是的，他们讨厌我。我觉得在小公司里，人际关系网比大公司要复杂得多，在大公司里更容易保持匿名。
[00:15:12.610] So yeah, I just have that recurring fear of if I didn't befriend everyone and have a personal relationship with everyone, then I'm uncool. Or maybe they don't think I'm worth knowing or
[00:15:12.610] 所以，我总是担心，如果我不能和每个人都成为朋友，建立私人关系，那我就会显得很土。或者他们觉得我不值得认识。
[00:15:22.530] something like that, which is so negative for no reason. But it's just the first thing that pops up into my head. Yeah, I guess that's tough too, because it's like impossible to know every single
[00:15:22.530] 诸如此类，莫名其妙地就这么消极。但这却是我脑海里第一个冒出来的想法。是啊，我觉得这也很难，因为要了解所有事情几乎是不可能的。
[00:15:33.410] person in the office. I guess maybe if you're like in a very small company, less than 20 people, but like, I feel like even then, it's hard to know everyone and be like, friendly or personal with
[00:15:33.410] 办公室里的人。我想也许在那种很小的公司，不到20人，可能会比较容易，但我觉得即使是那样，也很难认识每个人，更别说和他们建立友好或私人的关系了。
[00:15:46.530] every single person in the company slash office. So it's like, realistically, you should give yourself a break. But also at the same time, it definitely feels like you need to be on everyone's best side. So it almost matters even more to be like really likable in the office.
[00:15:46.530] 公司/办公室里的每个人都对你很友好。所以说，说实话，你应该给自己放个假。但同时，你又感觉自己必须和每个人都保持良好关系。因此，在办公室里受欢迎就显得尤为重要。
[00:16:04.930] Yeah, definitely. And I think it only seems like something that I'm failing to do because I can see that other people are succeeding in it. And I think that probably goes for a lot of things at
[00:16:04.930] 是的，当然。我觉得之所以觉得自己做不到，是因为我看到其他人都能成功。而且我觉得很多事情都是这样。
[00:16:15.650] work, even just beyond the social stuff. But some people are just very talented and remembering everyone's names or going up and introducing themselves. Maybe they've been a part of the company for a longer time, or they're in a more high visibility, like leadership position.
[00:16:15.650] 工作方面，即使不谈社交，也需要保持良好的沟通。有些人确实很有天赋，能记住每个人的名字，或者主动上前自我介绍。也许他们在公司工作时间较长，或者身居要职，比如领导岗位。
[00:16:30.770] So naturally, as like a 27 year old, I guess, slightly lower level employee, I shouldn't be comparing myself to these cornerstones of the company. But I do. I guess the point I'm trying
[00:16:30.770] 所以，很自然地，作为一个27岁左右、级别稍低的员工，我不应该把自己和这些公司的中流砥柱相提并论。但我确实这么做了。我想表达的重点是……
[00:16:42.290] to make is like, on my happy days, it's fine and dandy. Like I can just look at that situation and be like, oh, that's so admirable that this person is able to pull that off. But it's on the bad days,
[00:16:42.290] 感觉就像，在我心情好的时候，一切都很顺利。我可以看着这种情况，然后想，哦，这个人能做到这一点真是太令人钦佩了。但到了心情不好的时候，
[00:16:51.890] right? Or the off days where you're already feeling insecure about yourself. That's where the spin starts of like, oh, it's because I'm x or it's because I'm y that I'm unable to do that.
[00:16:51.890] 对吧？或者在状态不佳的日子里，你已经对自己缺乏自信了。这时你就会开始胡思乱想，比如，哦，是因为我是x，或者因为我是y，所以我才做不到。
[00:17:02.850] Yeah, I think interacting in the office, especially is just difficult because as you mentioned earlier, you kind of have to be on the whole time. We're kind of not used to that anymore. True. Honestly, there are definitely days where I go in the office and I'm just like,
[00:17:02.850] 是啊，我觉得在办公室里互动尤其困难，因为就像你之前说的，你得时刻保持在线。我们已经不太习惯这样了。确实如此。说实话，确实有些时候我去办公室，心里就想：
[00:17:20.530] wow, I hope no one's in the office. I'm just gonna try to like go in and get some work done and then quietly leave. Please no one look at me. You know? Yes, I totally feel you. I mean,
[00:17:20.530] 哇，希望办公室里没人。我打算进去做点工作，然后悄悄离开。拜托，别看我。你懂的？是的，我完全理解你。我的意思是，
[00:17:32.050] some people are just so good at playing the social political game in the office. And I think that's what's very striking to me too. And I guess not everyone thinks about it as like politics per
[00:17:32.050] 有些人真的很擅长在办公室里玩弄人际政治游戏。我觉得这一点也让我非常惊讶。而且我猜并不是每个人都把这看作是政治。
[00:17:44.050] se, but it's more of just like connecting with people and if they're higher level, then that's great. But for me, I feel like it's a little bit harder to do that. You know, when people are really
[00:17:44.050] 是的，但更像是与人建立联系，如果他们的水平更高，那就太好了。但对我来说，我觉得做到这一点有点难。你知道，当人们真的
[00:17:55.010] good at the social game and they are on and they are ready to show up, I can't help but think sometimes, oh, is this going to affect my performance review? Or like, will this person
[00:17:55.010] 他们很擅长社交，而且状态很好，随时准备出现，我有时忍不住会想，哦，这会影响我的绩效考核吗？或者，这个人会……
[00:18:04.690] have better career growth than me because they're closer to whoever and things like that. It's a lot of weirdness that I think reminds me sort of of seeing like a teacher's pet back in high school
[00:18:04.690] 他们的职业发展比我好，因为他们人脉更广之类的。这感觉很奇怪，让我想起了高中时老师的宠儿。
[00:18:16.290] or like middle school. But in the workplace, it's a little bit more subtle, I guess. Right, right. That's true. I think this is something that I've also come to realize more and more,
[00:18:16.290] 或者像中学时期那样。但在职场上，情况就更微妙一些，我想。对，对。确实如此。我觉得这一点我也越来越意识到了。
[00:18:27.730] the longer that we work, is that like, sure you can go to work and, you know, keep your head down and just like do the work and do well, move along in your career projection or whatever trajectory.
[00:18:27.730] 我们工作的时间越长，就越有可能出现这种情况：你当然可以去上班，埋头苦干，把工作做好，朝着你的职业规划或任何发展轨迹前进。
[00:18:41.890] But ultimately, having a relationship with the people you work with, like you don't have to be best friends or anything, but like having a positive and good relationship with them is super beneficial. Because a lot of work is like interacting with people and if you have some
[00:18:41.890] 但归根结底，和同事建立良好的关系——不必成为最好的朋友，但保持积极友好的关系——是非常有益的。因为很多工作都需要与人互动，如果你和他们之间有一些良好的关系，就能更好地应对工作中的各种挑战。
[00:18:57.890] sort of like solid foundation, then it's harder for people to be mean to you. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, like the simplest way I can put it is like if they kind of know you,
[00:18:57.890] 就像打好基础一样，别人就很难对你不好。你明白我的意思吗？嗯，没错。是啊，最简单的解释就是，如果他们认识你，
[00:19:10.050] they're going to try to be nice to you and, you know, give you the benefit of the doubt maybe if you, you know, slip up sometimes here and there. So it's ultimately a benefit and that's also where
[00:19:10.050] 他们会尽量对你友好，而且，你知道，如果你偶尔犯错，他们可能会给你一些宽容。所以从长远来看，这是一种好处，这也是为什么
[00:19:22.450] as you mentioned, like an insecurity lies because you're like, oh shoot, like how can I be better in this? Am I doing this right? There's no real playbook or like guide on how to socialize properly at work and like form these bonds. So it's definitely always encouraging,
[00:19:22.450] 正如你所说，不安全感就像谎言，你会想，哎呀，我该怎么做才能做得更好？我这样做对吗？其实并没有什么现成的指南或方法教你如何在工作中恰当地社交并建立人际关系。所以，这绝对总是令人鼓舞的。
[00:19:39.010] but also discouraging seeing other people do it so well and then you're like, oh shoot, okay, how do I be like them? Yeah, exactly. And I think also the connections that you make at work
[00:19:39.010] 但看到别人做得那么好也会让人沮丧，你会想，哎呀，我该怎么才能像他们一样呢？没错，就是这样。而且我觉得你在工作中建立的人脉关系也很重要。
[00:19:51.890] can live beyond your life at that specific company as well. I guess it depends on what industry you are and what kind of field you work in, but at least in the field that I'm in, I feel like it's
[00:19:51.890] 即使你在那家公司工作多年，你的职业生涯也可能继续延续下去。我想这取决于你所在的行业和你从事的领域，但至少在我所在的领域，我觉得是这样的。
[00:20:04.370] a pretty small pool of workers. So it's very, very common for people to have been like ex-co-workers from this place and, you know, in the past life they knew each other and things like that. So
[00:20:04.370] 这里的工人数量相当少。所以，经常会遇到以前在这里共事过的人，你知道，他们上辈子就认识，诸如此类的情况。
[00:20:15.330] I think the pressure of like knowing that sometimes of okay, these connections that I make now might be helpful for me 20, 30 years down the line or, you know, there's like some sort of benefit to like growing this relationship. I don't know why, but when my brain thinks,
[00:20:15.330] 我觉得压力在于，我知道现在建立的这些关系，或许在20、30年后会对我有帮助，或者说，发展这段关系会带来某种好处。我不知道为什么，但当我的大脑这样想的时候，
[00:20:31.170] okay, this is really beneficial and helpful, then it starts to get anxiety about it. So then I'm like, okay, there's a really big benefit to this, which means that if I don't build this or grow
[00:20:31.170] 好吧，这确实很有益也很有帮助，但随后我又开始为此感到焦虑。所以我就想，好吧，这件事确实有很大的好处，这意味着如果我不去建立或发展它，就会有后果。
[00:20:42.850] this, then I'm losing out on that benefit. So then the pressure of like knowing that if I fuck this up, then I'm walking away from like a big plus in my life just makes the task even more daunting
[00:20:42.850] 这样一来，我就失去了那份好处。所以，想到如果我搞砸了，就会失去人生中的一大优势，这种压力让这项任务变得更加艰巨。
[00:20:54.210] and scary. But it's like, there's no need to think about it this way because really it's just like, oh, you know, I want to get to know this person anyway. It's an added benefit that this might be
[00:20:54.210] 也挺吓人的。但其实没必要这么想，因为说到底，我就是想了解这个人。这或许是个额外的好处。
[00:21:02.530] beneficial later. But is this like in general anyone or is it more for like people who are maybe like a higher up somewhere where you're like, oh, this is like a big potential career
[00:21:02.530] 以后会有好处吗？但这适用于所有人吗？还是更适用于那些身居高位的人，比如你会觉得“哦，这很有发展潜力”的那种人？
[00:21:19.730] connection? I guess I feel the pressure a little bit more for a higher ups or like management level. But I do sometimes think about how, you know, at work you naturally gravitate towards certain people, just personality meshes or maybe you guys have a lot of overlapping projects
[00:21:19.730] 关系？我觉得跟高层或者管理层打交道压力更大一些。但我有时也会想，在工作中，你自然而然会和某些人走得很近，可能是性格合得来，或者你们有很多共同的项目。
[00:21:35.890] together and those are very natural and organic friendships. For me, I think I just feel content with those friendships and I don't really feel a need to like branch out because there's like an
[00:21:35.890] 我们在一起，这些友谊非常自然而然。对我来说，我觉得这些友谊让我很满足，我并不觉得需要拓展人脉，因为……
[00:21:47.250] extra benefit or something like that. But because I don't do that, I feel like I'm losing out on other relationships that could be helpful later on. I see what you mean. I think I'm kind of similar
[00:21:47.250] 额外的好处之类的。但因为我不这么做，我觉得我错失了一些以后可能有用的关系。我明白你的意思。我觉得我和你有点类似。
[00:21:57.650] to. I'm not really one to like just reach out, but it's more like, oh, well if you're going to be on this project too, okay, then we can meet. Right. Especially in terms of like higher ups
[00:21:57.650] 我其实不太喜欢主动联系别人，但更像是，哦，如果你也参与这个项目，那好，我们可以见个面。对。尤其是像高层领导那样的人。
[00:22:10.210] and stuff. But I do sometimes feel, I don't know what the right word here is, like maybe almost like jealous? Where I'm like, damn, like this person knows everyone at work. I don't know people like
[00:22:10.210] 诸如此类。但我有时确实会觉得，我不知道该用什么词来形容，可能有点像嫉妒？就是那种感觉，天哪，这个人认识公司里的所有人。我却不认识那么多人。
[00:22:24.530] this certain person knows everyone, but then I'm like, okay, this is like clearly my own fault though. Like I'm not that, I'm not a social butterfly at work, so there's only so much you can do with
[00:22:24.530] 这个人认识所有人，但我转念一想，好吧，这显然是我的错。我不是那种人，我不是职场社交达人，所以能做的也就这么多了。
[00:22:35.170] that. But I think it does ultimately lead to like some sort of, I don't know if it's necessarily like insecurity, but it's almost like a feeling of, oh shoot, I could slash should be better in this area.
[00:22:35.170] 确实如此。但我认为这最终会导致某种程度的，我不知道这是否一定是缺乏安全感，但几乎就像一种感觉，哦，糟糕，我在这方面应该做得更好。
[00:22:49.810] And I feel like maybe as we talk about all this stuff, the working environment seems to lend itself well to like these certain feelings. Just constantly comparing yourself to people around you. There's like a constant comparison, like maybe in the background of my mind, just like constantly
[00:22:49.810] 我觉得，也许当我们谈论这些事情的时候，工作环境很容易让人产生这些感受。就是不断地把自己和周围的人比较。就像一种持续不断的比较，可能就在我的潜意识里，总是这样。
[00:23:09.490] running, comparing me to everyone around me. I think it's because it's work and there's like the idea of up and down movement. You could move up, but you could also just as easily like move down.
[00:23:09.490] 跑步，总是让我和周围的人比较。我觉得是因为跑步是一项工作，它体现了起伏跌宕的概念。你可以向上发展，但同样也可以向下沉沦。
[00:23:22.450] So maybe we're just like always hyper aware of our surroundings at work because we're like, oh shoot, how do I be better? And with that, it's just very natural to compare yourself to people who you think
[00:23:22.450] 所以，也许我们总是对工作环境格外敏感，因为我们会想，哎呀，我该如何做得更好？因此，很自然地就会把自己和那些你认为比自己优秀的人比较。
[00:23:35.730] are like better. I guess it's just like, it's a breeding ground for insecurities. Yeah, that's a good point. I guess it does kind of make me feel like I'm back in high school again,
[00:23:35.730] 感觉更好一些。我觉得这里就像是滋生不安全感的温床。嗯，你说得对。感觉好像又回到了高中时代。
[00:23:46.370] like comparing myself to the popular kids or the smart kids wondering, oh, how come I'm not like them or trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong basically. But in the flip side, I feel like
[00:23:46.370] 就像我会拿自己和那些受欢迎的孩子或者聪明的孩子比较，然后纳闷，为什么我跟他们不一样，或者总想弄明白自己到底哪里做错了。但另一方面，我觉得……
[00:23:59.170] sometimes the insecurities that I feel from these comparisons that I make with my coworkers at work go beyond just like my skill level. But sometimes it makes me question my career choices, I guess
[00:23:59.170] 有时候，我跟同事比较后产生的不安全感，不仅仅体现在我的技能水平上。有时候，这种比较甚至会让我质疑自己的职业选择。
[00:24:10.530] is the right phrase. Yeah. It's nothing super dramatic or anything, but it is kind of dramatic in that when I have coworkers who are maybe super passionate about what they do or when you watch
[00:24:10.530] 这句话说得对。是的。这倒没什么特别戏剧性的，但某种程度上也挺戏剧性的，因为当我的同事们对自己的工作充满热情时，或者当你看到他们……
[00:24:23.250] them speak, it seems like, oh, they really love this role or like they really love this company or this job, things like that. It makes me wonder if I really love this role or if I really love
[00:24:23.250] 他们说话的时候，感觉好像真的很喜欢这个角色，或者真的很喜欢这家公司或者这份工作，诸如此类。这让我不禁怀疑，我是否真的喜欢这个角色，或者我是否真的……
[00:24:35.010] this company. And this isn't to say that I'm like constantly questioning this, but I think the nature of these comparisons is that it plants these ideas inside your head that maybe weren't even
[00:24:35.010] 这家公司。这并不是说我一直在质疑这一点，但我认为这些比较的本质在于，它会在你脑海中植入一些你原本可能从未想过的想法。
[00:24:45.090] there in the first place. So at least for me, when I've seen coworkers really excel in their work or be super passionate about what they're doing, I just have questions of like, I wonder if I'm
[00:24:45.090] 首先，我一开始就在那里。所以至少对我来说，当我看到同事们在工作中表现出色或者对自己的工作充满热情时，我就会想，我是不是也一样呢？
[00:24:57.810] as passionate about what I'm doing or how do other people see me is like the other question too. Do I come off that passionate or do I come off like I don't care? That's a good observation.
[00:24:57.810] 我对自己所做的事情是否充满热情，或者别人如何看待我，这和另一个问题类似。我表现得充满热情吗？还是显得漠不关心？这是一个很好的观察。
[00:25:10.610] You're right. Like there's definitely those people at work who you're like, whoa, they were made for this role. They are killing it in the vibes category. But I guess it's kind of similar
[00:25:10.610] 你说得对。就像工作中确实有些人，你会觉得，哇，他们简直就是为这个职位而生的。他们在氛围营造方面做得非常出色。但我觉得这有点类似。
[00:25:25.250] to like a conversation we've had before where it's almost like social media, you know? Like we just see the good parts, but we don't know what the behind the scenes necessarily, you know, maybe
[00:25:25.250] 就像我们以前有过的那种对话，感觉就像在社交媒体上一样，你知道吗？我们只能看到好的一面，但并不一定了解幕后的情况，你知道吗？
[00:25:37.570] they're just really good at being a hype man, bringing the vibes up. But like behind the scenes, they're like, I don't know, stressed as fuck and like working their ass off or something.
[00:25:37.570] 他们真的很擅长带动气氛，活跃气氛。但私底下，他们可能压力山大，拼命工作什么的。
[00:25:49.890] But you're right. I think there's so many things that make me as well kind of think, is this still the right job for me? And I think we're probably coming around the age where these existential
[00:25:49.890] 但你说得对。我觉得有很多事情也让我不禁思考，这份工作还适合我吗？而且我觉得我们可能都到了开始思考这些存在主义问题的年纪了。
[00:26:05.170] crises are more common because we've been working for like at least five years now. I guess these thoughts, at least for me, these thoughts pop up where it's just like, oh, this is gonna be like
[00:26:05.170] 危机发生的频率更高了，因为我们已经工作至少五年了。我想，至少对我来说，这些想法会突然冒出来，比如，哦，这又要来了。
[00:26:17.730] the rest of our working lives. Yeah, no, totally. Yeah, and I'm like, is this it? Like, are we happy here? Like, is this good to continue here? I actually had a friend text me recently and she was like,
[00:26:17.730] 我们余下的职业生涯。是啊，没错，完全是这样。是啊，我就想，这就是全部了吗？我们在这里快乐吗？继续待在这里好吗？我最近有个朋友给我发短信，她说，
[00:26:33.250] I think I might want to do a career change. Oh my god. And I was like, damn. And she was like, yeah, I just don't know if I can continue down this job anymore. But like, I also have no idea
[00:26:33.250] 我觉得我可能想换个工作。天哪。我当时就想，糟了。然后她说，是啊，我不知道我还能不能继续做这份工作。但是，我也完全不知道该怎么办。
[00:26:45.810] what I want to change my career to. And I was like, I don't know either. Like, I don't know if I want to stay on this career path either. And I don't know if I were to change what I would do either.
[00:26:45.810] 我想换个职业方向。但我当时想，我也不知道。我不知道自己是否想继续走这条路。我也不知道如果换工作的话，我会做什么。
[00:26:56.610] Dude, yeah, I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately too. And I think it truly is the age. It's like truly the point where you're like, okay, I'm used to it. It's no longer super new and scary
[00:26:56.610] 兄弟，是啊，我最近也一直在想这个问题。我觉得这真的跟年龄有关。就是到了某个阶段，你会觉得，好吧，我已经习惯了。它不再那么新鲜，也不再那么可怕了。
[00:27:05.970] to me. So then like, what's next? Almost. The thought that I've been having a lot lately is like, okay, say I don't change anything. So I'm maintaining whatever is normal right now. Then in
[00:27:05.970] 对我来说。那么，接下来呢？差不多吧。我最近一直在想，好吧，假设我什么都不改变。所以我维持现状。然后在
[00:27:17.810] the next, say, like 10 years or something, if I become a director, but just like moving down the path that I'm currently in, like would I be happy? Because if that's what I want, then that's this is
[00:27:17.810] 比如说，未来十年左右，如果我成为一名导演，但仍然沿着我现在走的这条路走下去，我会快乐吗？因为如果这就是我想要的，那么这就是……
[00:27:29.650] the perfect spot that I'm in. Or like, I just need to continue walking down this path essentially. But if it's not, then it's like, what's the point almost? And I think there's no real answer to it
[00:27:29.650] 我现在所处的位置简直完美。或者说，我只需要继续沿着这条路走下去就行了。但如果并非如此，那感觉就像，这一切还有什么意义呢？我觉得这个问题没有真正的答案。
[00:27:41.410] probably. And I can't ever separate how much of this is just humans naturally just don't want to work. I think people enjoy playing more than they enjoy working. So I'm sure a lot of this
[00:27:41.410] 或许吧。而且我始终无法分辨这其中有多少是因为人类天生就不想工作。我觉得人们更喜欢玩乐而不是工作。所以我确信很多时候……
[00:27:53.010] existential crisis is that, but it's also just like, how do you know if this is what you want to do? Because I guess I'm just not the type of person who's like, head over heels. This is like
[00:27:53.010] 存在危机就是这样，但它也关乎，你怎么知道这是否是你想要做的？因为我想我不是那种会全身心投入的人。这就像……
[00:28:04.370] the dream job that I've had since I was one years old, you know, like that kind of thing. I guess if you're not extra passionate, like this isn't your dream job from day one,
[00:28:04.370] 我从一岁起就梦想着能从事这份工作，你知道，就是那种感觉。我想，如果你没有特别的热情，比如这份工作并非从一开始就是你梦想的工作，
[00:28:14.050] then everyone else who's not in that perspective, shares this perspective of like, this is nice, I guess. But like, is this perfect? Or is this what I truly want? And then maybe this is where we all
[00:28:14.050] 然后，其他所有不持这种观点的人，都会有这样的看法：这挺好的，我想。但是，这完美吗？或者，这真的是我想要的吗？也许，这就是我们所有人的共同之处。
[00:28:24.690] spin. Yeah, I mean, work is work. I feel like, yeah, okay, I'm gonna blame this on media and movies. Because what you said earlier totally reminded me of that. You have a dream job since
[00:28:24.690] 旋转。是啊，我的意思是，工作就是工作。我觉得，好吧，我要把这一切归咎于媒体和电影。因为你之前说的话让我完全想起了这一点。你有一份梦寐以求的工作，因为
[00:28:41.490] like a baby, since you were a baby, and then you work towards that and you like, you know, try to get that job. And then in the end, it's like all happy. You're like, oh my god,
[00:28:41.490] 就像个婴儿一样，从小就梦想着得到那份工作，然后你朝着那个目标努力，你知道，努力争取那份工作。最后，一切都圆满成功，你会觉得，我的天哪！
[00:28:49.650] like, this is my dream job. Like, this is the best ever. That's like such a fairy tale, like movie kind of synopsis. And it just got me thinking how like, you know how there's that
[00:28:49.650] 就像，这是我的梦想工作。就像，这是有史以来最好的工作。这简直就像童话故事，就像电影情节一样。这让我开始思考，你知道，就像……
[00:29:01.970] saying that's like, love the work you do and you don't work a day in your life? Dude, okay, I think that is totally misleading. Because every time something that I enjoy turns into work, it's no longer enjoyable. Right? Because you're like being forced to do it.
[00:29:01.970] 你说这就像你热爱你的工作，所以你这辈子一天都不觉得是在工作？兄弟，好吧，我觉得这完全是误导。因为每次我喜欢的事情变成工作，它就不再有趣了。对吧？因为你感觉像是被迫去做。
[00:29:21.410] Suddenly there's a schedule, there's like deadlines, people are depending on you. It literally like sucks the enjoyment out of it. So I actually do not go by that saying. I am anti that saying.
[00:29:21.410] 突然间，一切都变得有条不紊，有各种截止日期，还有人指望着你。这简直把工作的乐趣都扼杀了。所以我根本不信奉那句老话。我反对那句老话。
[00:29:36.450] So what I kind of go by like personally, is if you can find a job that you don't hate, and you can like, find joy in parts of it, then that's like already really good. Because if you think about it, a lot of people probably hate their jobs,
[00:29:36.450] 所以我个人的做法是，如果你能找到一份不讨厌的工作，而且还能从中找到一些乐趣，那就已经很好了。因为仔细想想，很多人可能都很讨厌自己的工作。
[00:29:55.490] like legitimately hate their jobs, right? We're already super lucky if we can find a job that is not soul sucking, and like, just ripping you apart, especially if you have like cool co workers,
[00:29:55.490] 真的会讨厌自己的工作，对吧？如果我们能找到一份不让人心力交瘁、不让人崩溃的工作，就已经非常幸运了，尤其是有很棒的同事的时候。
[00:30:09.810] and like a pretty good environment. Then I'm like, dude, honestly, that is like more than I can ask for. I think that's a good way of looking at it. I don't know if it's
[00:30:09.810] 而且环境也相当不错。然后我就想，老兄，说真的，这简直超出我的预期了。我觉得这样想挺好的。我不知道这算不算……
[00:30:20.690] it comes to me as naturally like that kind of perspective. Like I definitely understand it because like you said, work is work. I'm not someone who grew up with like a huge passion
[00:30:20.690] 我自然而然地就认同这种观点。我完全理解，因为就像你说的，工作就是工作。我不是那种从小就对工作充满热情的人。
[00:30:29.570] for insert whatever field. So then finding the next best thing is like a stable job where I'm happy enough, and I'm doing well enough and things like that. I guess the question is like,
[00:30:29.570] 插入任何字段。所以，找到次优方案就像找到一份稳定的工作，让我足够满意，工作表现也足够好等等。我想问题在于：
[00:30:41.090] if we're going to be doing this or whatever work thing for the next like 60 years, then is good enough? Good enough? You know, like, basically, if I only have one shot on this earth, what do I want
[00:30:41.090] 如果我们接下来六十年都要做这件事，或者做其他什么工作，那这样就够好了吗？够好吗？你知道，基本上，如果我只有一次机会，我想要什么？
[00:30:55.330] to be doing for 60 years? Is it this specific job? I guess I can't imagine a job where I would be completely and you know, 100% satisfied. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't keep searching.
[00:30:55.330] 要我做60年？就是指这份工作吗？我想我无法想象有一份工作能让我完全、百分之百满意。但这并不意味着我不应该继续寻找。
[00:31:06.930] I don't know. I think that's fair. I guess I try not to think too hard about it because you know, it's potentially depressing. It really is. But I guess my personal philosophy is kind of
[00:31:06.930] 我不知道。我觉得这很合理。我尽量不去想太多，因为你知道，这可能会让人沮丧。真的。但我猜我的个人哲学是这样的……
[00:31:19.410] like, try to fulfill your life in the other aspects, like you know, hobbies, outside of work. But honestly, that kind of works for me, but it doesn't necessarily work for everyone. And work,
[00:31:19.410] 比如，尝试在工作之外的其他方面充实生活，比如培养爱好。但说实话，这对我来说行得通，但不一定适合所有人。还有工作，
[00:31:34.530] if we think about it, it does take up a huge chunk of our lives. I think I saw a chart once that was like, the amount of time you see certain people and like co-workers was the highest. Oh my god.
[00:31:34.530] 仔细想想，这确实占据了我们生活的很大一部分。我好像曾经看过一张图表，上面说你和某些人见面的时间，比如和同事见面的时间，是最多的。我的天哪。
[00:31:47.570] Because like, if you work a standard nine to five job, you literally see them the most, like in your life. And I was like, oh fuck, like should I be making friends at work? Damn dude. I don't know how I feel about that.
[00:31:47.570] 因为如果你朝九晚五地上班，你这辈子见到他们的次数可能最多。我就想，我去，我应该在工作中交朋友吗？哎，老兄。我不知道该怎么看待这件事。
[00:32:03.410] It's actually so funny because my hiring manager, who switched teams later on, sometimes I catch up with her and she's like, oh, um, have you been making friends at work? And I was like, oh, uh,
[00:32:03.410] 这事儿其实挺搞笑的，因为我的招聘经理后来换了团队，有时候我跟她聊天，她会问我：“哦，嗯，你在工作中交到朋友了吗？” 我就会说：“哦，呃……”
[00:32:16.370] I don't know. Like, um, you know, working on it or in the beginning I was like, oh, not really, but you know, everyone's cool. And she was like, oh, I think it's like nice if you make some
[00:32:16.370] 我不知道。嗯，你知道，一开始我感觉，哦，其实不是，但你知道，大家都挺好的。然后她就说，哦，我觉得如果你做一些……挺好的。
[00:32:28.690] friends at work. That's my tip for you. I was like, shit, she's probably right. Like I should step up my like social life. Dude, I mean, it's hard. I feel like it takes a lot of effort and
[00:32:28.690] 和同事朋友多接触。这是我给你的建议。我当时就想，完了，她说的可能对。我应该多花点时间在社交生活上。兄弟，我的意思是，这很难。我觉得这需要付出很多努力，而且
[00:32:42.530] the right timing and all of that, but for sure. Highly recommend a close work friend. Shout out to Chelsea. But yeah, I guess like you're right. There's no need to be super negative about it
[00:32:42.530] 时机合适什么的都无所谓，但肯定没错。强烈推荐一位关系很好的同事朋友。特别感谢切尔西。不过，我想你说得对，没必要这么消极。
[00:32:54.210] unless there's something like truly wrong with your job that's like causing you immense distress. Then of course find an outlet. But I guess the other way of looking at it too is like, because we spend literally a third of our lives at work, might as well enjoy it.
[00:32:54.210] 除非你的工作真的出了大问题，让你痛苦不堪。那样的话，当然要找个发泄的途径。但我觉得换个角度想，既然我们一生中有三分之一的时间都在工作，那为什么不享受工作呢？
[00:33:08.850] The parts of work that I definitely enjoy and kind of value highly for myself, it's like constantly growing or maybe like learning new things or like learning about different aspects of the world that I wouldn't have known otherwise without this position basically. So yeah,
[00:33:08.850] 这份工作中我真正喜欢并且非常看重的部分，就是不断成长，学习新知识，或者了解世界上不同的方面，如果没有这份工作，我根本不会知道这些。所以，是的。
[00:33:23.090] definitely every job has its perks. For sure. This is just my personal view. So like, if people out there are like, no, I need to quit my job. Just do that. You know,
[00:33:23.090] 当然，每份工作都有它的好处。这是肯定的。这只是我个人的看法。所以，如果有人觉得，不，我需要辞职，那就去做吧。你知道的。
[00:33:35.170] go find the job that makes you happy. To be fair though, I think like I did have that happen. Like my first job out of college. At first I was like, oh, this is like great, you know,
[00:33:35.170] 去找一份让你快乐的工作。不过说实话，我觉得我好像确实找到了。比如我大学毕业后的第一份工作。一开始我觉得，哦，这太棒了，你知道吗？
[00:33:46.210] gonna like take it easy and like, you know, hopefully it'll be chill. But then what I started realizing was like I wasn't learning and I didn't like the environment. I don't think I
[00:33:46.210] 本来想放松放松，希望一切都很平静。但后来我开始意识到，我好像没学到什么东西，而且我也不喜欢那种环境。我觉得我
[00:33:58.290] hated my job necessarily, but there were aspects that like drove me crazy kind of where I was like, oh, I'm like not learning here. Like I'm stagnant and I see no future maybe or like maybe I think
[00:33:58.290] 我倒不一定讨厌我的工作，但有些方面真的让我抓狂，比如我会想，哦，我在这里根本学不到任何东西。我感觉自己停滞不前，看不到未来，或者说，我觉得……
[00:34:13.810] I saw some like issues within the company structure that I personally didn't like and I didn't think it like would be good for me in the long run. So I quickly realized I need to
[00:34:13.810] 我发现公司架构中存在一些我个人不喜欢的类似问题，而且我认为从长远来看这对我不利。所以我很快意识到我需要……
[00:34:28.130] leave. I was like, okay, yeah, fuck it. Like if you gotta go, you gotta go. So I'm also not opposed to like leaving your job and finding one that brings you more joy. Yeah, and it definitely gets
[00:34:28.130] 离开。我当时想，好吧，管他呢。如果非走不可，那就走吧。所以我也不反对辞职，去找一份更让自己快乐的工作。是啊，而且肯定会……
[00:34:41.410] really complicated once you factor in like the money aspect and you know, the health benefits and all of that. Like I think even like the search to finding the perfect job just logistically is
[00:34:41.410] 一旦把薪资、医疗福利等等因素考虑进去，事情就变得非常复杂了。我觉得光是找到一份完美的工作，从实际操作层面来说，就够让人头疼的了。
[00:34:53.090] difficult already. And we're only in our late twenties, but I can't imagine once you have kids and like a family to support and there's like dependents under your name, like I can't imagine
[00:34:53.090] 现在已经很不容易了。我们才快三十岁，但我无法想象一旦有了孩子，要养家糊口，名下还有需要赡养的人，那会是什么感觉，我简直无法想象。
[00:35:03.650] doing a career change in that time of your life. So I guess if you were to do it, then maybe now when you have a little bit less obligations and a little bit less responsibilities would be a good
[00:35:03.650] 在你人生的那个阶段进行职业转型。所以我想，如果你真的想这么做，那么现在也许是个好时机，因为你的义务和责任都比较少。
[00:35:12.850] time for a career change. But yeah, it's hard, you know, like I think in the ideal world, rent would be free, like food would be free, transportation, all of that free. And I could just go into different
[00:35:12.850] 是时候换个工作了。不过，你知道，这很难。我觉得在理想的世界里，房租、食物、交通等等都是免费的。那样我就可以去做其他事情了。
[00:35:22.930] fields and see what truly makes sense for me, but money doesn't grow on trees. So it's kind of like you have to consider the practical aspects of life too. But we've actually done an episode about
[00:35:22.930] 我会去各个领域看看，找到真正适合自己的方向，但钱不是天上掉下来的。所以，你也得考虑生活的实际层面。我们之前也做过一期关于这个的节目。
[00:35:34.290] career changes a long time ago where one of our friends switched from her accounting role and into like aesthetician role because she found that that was her passion. And I just remember being so struck
[00:35:34.290] 很久以前，我们一位朋友的职业生涯发生了转变，她放弃了会计工作，转行做了美容师，因为她发现那才是她的真正热爱。我当时真的非常震惊。
[00:35:45.250] by that. Like I still think about that sometimes where a decision like that takes so much courage. It of course takes a lot of planning, I think, and the foresight to be able to like plan out how that
[00:35:45.250] 就是这样。我有时还会想起这件事，做出这样的决定需要多大的勇气。当然，我认为这需要周密的计划，以及预见未来的远见，才能提前规划好如何去做。
[00:35:57.170] fits into your life, like in terms of the career change and the apprenticeships and things like that. So when people do their career changes, I just admire it so much. And I think it's super cool.
[00:35:57.170] 它能融入你的生活，比如职业转型、学徒经历等等。所以当人们进行职业转型时，我真的非常佩服。我觉得这太酷了。
[00:36:07.170] And I always root for success for the people that go into career changes. For sure. I also think that the fear of changing your career can have roots in insecurity as well, which is so normal, I think,
[00:36:07.170] 我总是衷心希望那些选择职业转型的人能够成功。当然。我也认为，害怕改变职业也可能源于不安全感，这非常正常，我觉得。
[00:36:22.770] and common. But you know, it's inevitable to feel insecure like, oh, well, I've been doing this job for so long. I know it. I can keep doing it. But I don't know the like new job. I don't know if I
[00:36:22.770] 而且很常见。但你知道，感到不安全是不可避免的，比如，哦，我已经做了这么久的这份工作了。我知道我能胜任。但我对新工作不了解。我不知道我是否能做到。
[00:36:35.330] would be able to succeed in that. And I don't know what that would look like. And maybe it's naive of me to say, but I do feel like if you're really passionate about it, you're a hardworking
[00:36:35.330] 能够做到这一点。但我不知道那会是什么样子。也许我这么说很天真，但我确实觉得，如果你真的对某件事充满热情，并且非常努力，你就会成功。
[00:36:46.290] individual. You already have like a decent chance compared to someone who is like, you know, not passionate about it and like not as knowledgeable about a certain career. So I don't know if
[00:36:46.290] 作为一个人，你已经比那些对某个职业缺乏热情和了解的人有相当大的机会了。所以，我不知道……
[00:36:58.930] that's helpful or not, but I feel like that is on some level encouraging. Yeah, I think it is. And it kind of reminds me of the saying of like, there's no perfect time to have kids.
[00:36:58.930] 这或许有用，或许没用，但我感觉这在某种程度上是件令人鼓舞的事。是的，我也这么觉得。这让我想起那句老话：生孩子没有完美时机。
[00:37:09.970] So you might as well just have them at like whatever time. And I feel like that's applicable to a lot of things in life, actually. There's no perfect time. There's no way to like perfectly
[00:37:09.970] 所以你干脆就随便什么时候都行了。我觉得这其实适用于生活中的很多事情。没有完美的时间。也没有完美无缺的方法。
[00:37:19.010] optimize things like you might be really passionate about some job and you make the career change, but that job market might start failing or, you know, a recession might happen, things like that that are so unpredictable. But I guess it goes back to like what you said about
[00:37:19.010] 优化一些事情，比如你可能对某份工作充满热情，于是决定转行，但就业市场可能会开始萎缩，或者，你知道，可能会发生经济衰退，诸如此类难以预测的事情。但我想这又回到了你刚才说的那个话题。
[00:37:32.450] feeling, I guess, confidence in yourself more than your insecurities will let you. So just, you know, trusting yourself, I think can go a long way. And that's the same for work
[00:37:32.450] 我想，关键在于对自己更有信心，而不是被不安全感所束缚。所以，相信自己，我认为这非常重要。工作也是如此。
[00:37:42.290] too. Just like trust in your skills, trust in your work ethic. It's a little bit easier to say than to do, but it's I think a really big building block for your work life. Agreed.
[00:37:42.290] 没错。就像相信自己的能力一样，相信自己的职业道德。说起来容易做起来难，但我认为这是你职业生涯中非常重要的基石。同意。
[00:37:55.330] Before we wrap up, I have like a couple of bullet points on random work insecurities that I have. One is, you know how at work there's like free snacks or I guess not every company does,
[00:37:55.330] 在结束之前，我想就我个人在工作中遇到的一些不安全感提几点。其中之一是，你知道，公司里通常会有免费零食，或者至少不是每家公司都有。
[00:38:05.730] but at least at our company, we started to have free snacks. Sometimes there's like really good snacks and sometimes there's like bad snacks, right? And we also have free drinks. So sometimes
[00:38:05.730] 但至少在我们公司，我们开始提供免费零食了。有时候零食很好吃，有时候就比较难吃，对吧？我们也提供免费饮料。所以有时候
[00:38:15.250] when I like snack a lot at work, I'm like, does everyone know that I'm snacking like a f**k ton today? You know, like if I'm on like my second bag of chips and I have a can of Coke on my desk or
[00:38:15.250] 当我在工作时特别爱吃零食的时候，我就会想，大家是不是都知道我今天吃零食吃得特别多？你知道，比如我已经吃了第二包薯片，桌子上还放着一罐可乐……
[00:38:25.170] something, I'm like, do people think, you know, like are people judging me for snacking this much at work? Okay, honestly, they probably don't give a f**k. That's true.
[00:38:25.170] 我有时会想，别人会不会觉得，你知道，比如，他们会不会因为我在上班时间吃这么多零食而评判我？好吧，说实话，他们可能根本不在乎。确实如此。
[00:38:35.170] But I totally feel that. I think like one time I was kind of busy, so I took lunch at my desk, which at my company is not very common because we have ample cafeteria space. And I was like
[00:38:35.170] 但我完全能体会那种感觉。我记得有一次我比较忙，就在办公桌前吃了午饭，这在我们公司并不常见，因为我们有很大的餐厅空间。当时我就想：
[00:38:46.450] eating at my desk and I just, you know, found myself eating faster and faster because I was like, oh my god, I hope no one walks by and just like sees me eating at my desk because it's like
[00:38:46.450] 我在办公桌上吃东西，然后，你知道，我发现自己吃得越来越快，因为我心想，天哪，我希望没有人走过来看到我在办公桌上吃东西，因为感觉就像……
[00:38:56.930] low-key weird here that like, you know, normally people just go to the cafeteria. So I started like scurfing down my food. I was like, do I need to finish this as fast as possible so no one sees that I'm just eating at my desk?
[00:38:56.930] 这里气氛有点怪，你知道，通常大家都会去食堂吃饭。所以我就开始狼吞虎咽。我就想，我是不是得赶紧吃完，免得有人看到我在办公桌前吃东西？
[00:39:08.210] Oh my god, dude. Honestly, eating at work in general is so cursed because you know when you and your co-workers kind of like sit around a table at the cafeteria, I feel like even then
[00:39:08.210] 我的天啊，兄弟。说真的，在公司吃饭简直太糟糕了，你知道，当你和同事们围坐在食堂的桌子旁时，我觉得即使是那样，也会让人感觉不舒服。
[00:39:18.130] there's some like awkwardness of if I eat too fast and put my food away or something, is that like rude because other people are still eating? Or if I'm eating hella slow, like is that rude because
[00:39:18.130] 有时候会有点尴尬，比如我吃得太快，把食物收起来什么的，这样会不会很没礼貌，因为其他人还在吃？或者如果我吃得很慢，这样会不会很没礼貌？
[00:39:28.130] people are done with their lunch? Or even when I'm snacking, am I crunching these chips too loud? Like, you know, my boss or like my co-workers next to me, like do they think I'm eating too loud? There's just like these weird things that pop up.
[00:39:28.130] 大家午饭吃完了吗？或者就算我吃零食的时候，我嚼薯片的声音是不是太大了？比如，你知道，我的老板或者我旁边的同事会不会觉得我吃东西声音太大？就是会冒出这些奇怪的问题。
[00:39:42.210] No, absolutely. I used to be like really shy about opening my like cans of sparkling water or coke or whatever, like in the sitting area. Like the off, you know, the desk. Yeah, I was
[00:39:42.210] 不，当然。我以前特别害羞，不敢在休息区，比如桌子旁边，打开我的苏打水、可乐之类的罐装饮料。对，我以前
[00:39:56.770] like, oh my god, this is like so loud. So I would like open it by the fridge, you know, where it's like no one's working or less people are sitting around and working. I open it there and then I
[00:39:56.770] 天哪，这也太吵了吧。所以我会在冰箱旁边打开它，你知道，就是那种没人工作或者人比较少的地方。我会在那里打开它，然后我
[00:40:09.410] bring it over to my desk where it's like quieter. Oh my god, that's so funny. With return to office, I'm like feeling these things a little bit more because what I've also been insecure about lately
[00:40:09.410] 把它拿到我的办公桌旁，那里比较安静。我的天哪，这太搞笑了。回到办公室后，我对这些事情的感受更强烈了，因为我最近也一直对一些事情感到不安。
[00:40:21.170] is when I work, I'll listen to like a podcast because it's like stimulating enough to kind of get me into the zone when I'm working. But the podcast that I listen to, I feel like sometimes
[00:40:21.170] 我工作的时候会听播客，因为它能让我集中注意力，更容易进入工作状态。但我听的那个播客，我觉得有时候……
[00:40:31.090] can be a little bit on the immature side, shall I say? It's kind of like, oh, pop culture, like gossip, just like random stuff I can listen to in the background. When people like walk by my desk and
[00:40:31.090] 可以说，它有点不成熟。它有点像，哦，流行文化，比如八卦，就是那种我可以当背景音乐听的随机内容。当人们从我的桌子旁走过时，
[00:40:42.930] like the little YouTube thing is open on my laptop screen or something, I just feel so awkward about it. So I like immediately hide it or I try to just like listen to it on my phone or something. But
[00:40:42.930] 就像YouTube的小窗口在我的笔记本电脑屏幕上打开一样，我感觉很尴尬。所以我会立刻把它关掉，或者试着用手机之类的设备听。
[00:40:52.530] sometimes I'm like, I hope people can't tell that I'm listening to this podcast. That's so funny. Oh my god, I also talk to myself when I work sometimes. Oh my god, me too. Like I'm like
[00:40:52.530] 有时候我会想，希望别人听不出我在听播客。这太搞笑了。天哪，我工作的时候有时候也会自言自语。天哪，我也是。就像我
[00:41:03.090] muttering to myself like, oh dude, like this task is so annoying or like, oh fuck, I forgot something like go back in my files. And then sometimes when I'm doing that, I realize I'm like, oh shoot,
[00:41:03.090] 我一边嘟囔着，一边想着，哎呀，这任务真烦人，或者，糟了，我忘了什么东西，得回头去翻翻文件。然后有时候，当我这么做的时候，我突然意识到，哎呀，糟糕。
[00:41:13.970] I'm in the office. Like I hope no one has been listening to me just like muttering to myself. Oh my god. Well, yeah, I totally talk to myself too. But at work, I try not to because I'm like,
[00:41:13.970] 我在办公室。我希望没人听到我自言自语。我的天哪。嗯，是的，我也会自言自语。但在工作时，我尽量不这样做，因为我会想，
[00:41:25.890] it's like too close. Everyone's in too close of a proximity. Yeah. Okay, I have another insecurity. It's related to food again. We have different cafeterias where different food is served. And sometimes, you know, I look up what's getting served each day. I'm like, oh, today, you know
[00:41:25.890] 感觉太近了。每个人都靠得太近了。是啊。好吧，我还有另一个不安全感。还是跟食物有关。我们有不同的食堂，供应不同的食物。有时候，你知道，我会查一下每天供应什么。我会想，哦，今天，你知道的
[00:41:44.610] what, I'm feeling like this particular cafeteria because they have a certain food or something. But then sometimes my co-workers or people around me will be like, oh, lunchtime, you guys want to
[00:41:44.610] 我感觉自己特别喜欢这家食堂，因为他们有某种特定的食物之类的。但有时候我的同事或者周围的人会说，哦，午饭时间到了，你们想……
[00:41:56.770] grab, you know, they'll just stand up, like ask everyone around like, hey, anyone not eat yet? Like want to go get food? And it feels so rude to be like, no. Unless, of course, I've already eaten.
[00:41:56.770] 你知道，他们会站起来，问周围的人，嘿，还有谁没吃吗？要不要去吃点东西？如果说“不”，感觉很没礼貌。除非，当然，我已经吃过了。
[00:42:10.930] Right. So I usually just end up saying like, oh, yeah, sure. I'll grab food with you guys. But then the issue is we don't go to the cafeteria that I want. And I'm like too shy to speak up for
[00:42:10.930] 对。所以我通常最后都会说，哦，好的，当然。我跟你们一起吃。但问题是，我们去的不是我想去的食堂。而且我太害羞了，不敢主动争取。
[00:42:22.450] myself. Oh my god. Because I don't want to be like, oh my god, I'm so sorry, guys. But like, can we go to this one cafeteria, like walk all the way out of our building and walk to this other
[00:42:22.450] 我自己。我的天哪。因为我不想说，我的天哪，对不起各位。但是，我们能不能去那个食堂，就从我们这栋楼里走出来，走到另一个食堂去？
[00:42:33.090] building to eat here? You know, and just like disrupt their lives. So I just take it. I just take the L. No, I feel like they wouldn't even mind. They probably like, oh, it's like a nice
[00:42:33.090] 建个楼来这儿吃饭？你知道，这样会打扰他们的生活。所以我只能认栽。我只能认栽了。不，我觉得他们根本不会介意。他们可能还会想，哦，这就像一个不错的聚会。
[00:42:43.730] day to go on a walk. You're probably right. But I'm just like, I can't disrupt these people's lives. Actually, like corporate decisions regarding food are definitely awkward for me too,
[00:42:43.730] 适合出去散步的日子。你说的或许有道理。但我就是觉得，我不能打扰这些人的生活。其实，像公司在食品方面的决策，我也觉得很尴尬。
[00:42:54.770] because one of the things that happens is at my company two days out of the week, you can get free lunch. But if you go into the office on a day that's not the free lunch days, then you have to
[00:42:54.770] 因为我们公司每周有两天可以免费吃午餐。但如果你在非免费午餐日来上班，那就得自己掏钱。
[00:43:05.730] get lunch for yourself basically. So sometimes with really big meetings, my entire team will go in. So we'll be like, oh, this is the perfect time to do a team lunch. But I don't know why,
[00:43:05.730] 基本上就是自己一个人吃午饭。所以有时候开会特别大，我们整个团队都会去。然后我们就会想，哦，这是个一起吃午饭的好机会。但我不知道为什么，
[00:43:15.970] for some reason, I always get tasked with choosing their restaurant. Oh my god. And I'm just like, it's me again. Like I have to choose again. And it's not like we have a huge team and they're
[00:43:15.970] 不知为何，我总是被安排去选餐厅。天哪。我心想，又是我。又得选了。而且我们团队人手也不多，他们……
[00:43:27.090] very cool about eating whatever, like always down for anything. So it's not like they're food critics. But I'm just like, what should I pick? Like, is it you know, should I pick something
[00:43:27.090] 他们吃东西很随意，什么都愿意尝试。所以他们并不是美食评论家。但我当时就想，我该选什么呢？你知道，我应该选什么呢？
[00:43:35.810] Asian? Or do we eat this last time? Or is this too fusion or whatever? So I always have to work that balance a little bit. Oh, yeah, no, that's hard. That's for sure hard. It's like decision
[00:43:35.810] 亚洲菜？还是我们最后一次吃这个？或者这个太融合菜了？所以我总是得在这两者之间找到平衡。哦，是啊，这很难。确实很难。这就像做决定一样。
[00:43:46.370] paralysis. It is. Yeah. And it's a lot of pressure to and it's just like awkward. Like I have to just pass around my phone be like, you okay with this? You okay with this? You okay with this?
[00:43:46.370] 瘫痪。确实如此。是啊。而且压力很大，感觉很尴尬。我得不停地传手机，问：“这样可以吗？这样可以吗？这样可以吗？”
[00:43:55.650] Like I'm getting like a fucking vote or something. And they're probably all like, oh, yeah, anything's fine. And yeah, goddamn like, will they like it? I know maybe I have like a secret crystal on my
[00:43:55.650] 感觉就像我他妈的能投上一票似的。他们可能都会说，哦，是啊，什么都行。是啊，该死的，他们会喜欢吗？我知道我身上可能藏着什么秘密水晶……
[00:44:07.330] team where they're like, oh, I actually want to eat at this restaurant. But they just can't speak up because they're like, Oh, she's already chose. I don't want to I don't want to step all over her
[00:44:07.330] 团队里有些人会想：“哦，我其实想去这家餐厅吃饭。”但他们却不敢开口，因为他们会想：“哦，她已经选好了。我不想，我不想越俎代庖。”
[00:44:16.770] like that. Exactly. It's like my greatest fear. But do you ever ask? Oh, does anyone have any cravings? Dude, I do. But I feel like everyone's so considerate. They're just like, oh, like I'm down forever. Like happy to eat anything, which is like a very nice response.
[00:44:16.770] 就是这样。没错。这简直是我最大的恐惧。但你问过吗？“哦，有没有人特别想吃什么？” 哥们，我可是有的。不过我觉得大家都特别体贴。他们会说：“哦，我随时都愿意吃。” 好像什么都行，这真是太好了。
[00:44:32.610] But it's also just like doesn't help narrow any of the options down. Okay, I'm always just stuck at the GCU. I'm gonna send you an article and you should send it to your team. Oh my god, I read
[00:44:32.610] 但这似乎也无助于缩小选择范围。好吧，我总是被困在GCU（大峡谷大学）里。我会给你发一篇文章，你应该把它转发给你的团队。我的天哪，我读了
[00:44:43.010] this recently. And it was like, decisive people are much more liked because if you are indecisive, then you always put the onus on other people to make decisions and then they feel pressure.
[00:44:43.010] 最近我意识到，果断的人更受欢迎，因为如果你优柔寡断，就会把做决定的责任推给别人，让他们感到压力。
[00:44:58.850] Right? So if you can, like even if it's not a decision, but if you just toss something out there, you become more liked. Like on average. Interesting. Yeah, it's like a subconscious thing.
[00:44:58.850] 对吧？所以，如果你可以的话，即使这算不上一个决定，但如果你只是随口说说，你就会更受欢迎。平均来说是这样。有意思。是啊，这就像是一种潜意识的反应。
[00:45:11.570] That's actually good to know. But can you imagine if I fucking said that article in our team Slack like guys, I need you to read. Guys, look, I read this interesting article the other day.
[00:45:11.570] 这确实很有用。但你能想象如果我在团队 Slack 里说这篇文章，然后说：“伙计们，我得让你们看看。伙计们，听我说，我前几天读了一篇很有意思的文章。”会是什么场景吗？
[00:45:25.010] It's like the day you guys are choosing lunch. It's like at lunch. By the way, anyone craving any specific food today? Dude, I'm dead. But this makes so much sense because I feel like
[00:45:25.010] 就像你们今天选午饭吃什么一样。就像午饭时间一样。对了，今天有人特别想吃什么吗？老兄，我快笑死了。但这真的很有道理，因为我觉得
[00:45:38.690] outside of work too, like any food group food decision, it gets lost in the chaos. And like no one will make a decision because everyone's trying to be quote unquote considerate. But ultimately, it's actually not considerate. Dude, yeah. And I think even beyond work groups,
[00:45:38.690] 工作之外也是如此，就像任何关于食物的选择一样，它最终都会淹没在混乱之中。好像每个人都想“体贴他人”，所以没人会做决定。但说到底，这其实并不体贴。哥们，没错。而且我觉得即使在工作群体之外，
[00:45:53.250] the decision making always lands on like one or two people. It's like the same people every time rallying everyone. Yeah. I remember once at work, we were gonna get a team lunch. And the theme was like trash food. So we were deciding between fast food joints. Someone was
[00:45:53.250] 决策总是落到一两个人手里。每次都是那几个人召集大家。是啊。我记得有一次在公司，我们打算一起吃午饭。主题是垃圾食品。所以我们在几家快餐店之间做选择。有人……
[00:46:11.090] like, hey, anyone have any opinions on like, you know, what should we get like Taco Bell, McDonald's, stuff like that. And literally it was it was like so quiet. Oh, God. And I was like,
[00:46:11.090] 就像，嘿，大家有什么建议吗？比如，我们该吃点什么，像塔可钟、麦当劳之类的。当时真的特别安静。哦，天哪。然后我就想，
[00:46:24.850] ooh, like no one's making a decision. After like maybe 20 or 30 minutes with like no one responded. I was like, okay, to be fair. They also asked earlier, like, you know, anyway, so I manned up
[00:46:24.850] 哦，好像没人做决定似的。等了大概二三十分钟，还是没人回应。我就想，好吧，公平地说，他们之前也问过，你知道的，反正，所以我就硬着头皮回答了。
[00:46:39.170] and I was like, guys, let's get Taco Bell. Oh, nice. And then it was almost like, you could almost feel the like sigh of relief. Everyone was like, oh my god. Yeah, that sounds great. Like
[00:46:39.170] 然后我就说，伙计们，咱们去吃塔可钟吧。哦，好啊。然后，你几乎能感觉到大家如释重负地叹了口气。每个人都说，我的天哪。是啊，听起来真棒。就像
[00:46:50.370] down for Taco Bell. Awesome. Yeah. Dude, that's that's a power move right there. If I've ever seen one, I was like, someone has to make a decision. But also as someone who's always tasked
[00:46:50.370] 去塔可钟了。太棒了。是啊。老兄，这可是高招啊。如果说我见过什么高招，那就是：总得有人做决定。但同时，作为一个总是被委以重任的人……
[00:47:02.930] with choosing, I feel like you also have to pose the question in a way where there's only two options. Otherwise, no one will ever choose. So usually I'll kind of comb through the restaurant
[00:47:02.930] 我觉得在做选择的时候，问题必须提出得只有两个选项。否则，没人会做选择。所以通常我会仔细地在餐厅里逛逛。
[00:47:11.650] list and be like, okay, do we want bun mee or do we want pizza? And then I just have them choose between the two things. Oh, okay. That's like pretty good because then you don't have to do the
[00:47:11.650] 列个清单，然后说，好，我们是想吃米粉还是想吃披萨？然后我就让他们在两者之间做选择。哦，好的。这样挺好的，因为这样你就不用……
[00:47:22.610] full decision. But everyone else can also feel like they participated. Right. It's actually kind of a system that I feel like has been working with some of my close friends as well. Like when
[00:47:22.610] 完全由个人决定。但其他人也能感受到自己参与其中。没错。实际上，我觉得这套系统对我的一些好朋友也很有效。比如当
[00:47:33.330] we go to like a restaurant or something. Usually I feel like one of us will pull like three or so restaurants and the other person will like choose one. And I'm like, Oh, this is perfect, because
[00:47:33.330] 我们会去餐厅之类的。通常我觉得我们俩其中一个会列出三四家餐厅，然后另一个人从中选一家。然后我就想，哦，这太完美了，因为
[00:47:43.170] both people have like a say in something. Nice. That's a pretty good system. I know our conversation got a little derailed here at the end. Do you like not just work stuff, but I think it was kind of fun
[00:47:43.170] 两个人好像都有发言权。不错。这套系统挺好的。我知道我们最后聊得有点跑题了。你喜欢聊聊工作以外的话题吗？我觉得挺有意思的。
[00:47:55.170] to talk about our insecurities at work. And it's also interesting because some of these insecurities aren't necessarily just contained to work, but they're kind of like insecurities of life that just happen to also occur at work. And of course, there's also the work specific ones like, Oh my
[00:47:55.170] 谈谈我们在工作中的不安全感。有趣的是，有些不安全感并非仅限于工作，它们更像是生活中的不安全感，只是恰好也出现在工作中。当然，还有一些工作特有的不安全感，比如，哦，我的天哪
[00:48:15.410] God, am I ready to do this for the rest of my life and all of that kind of stuff. Thank you, Jisoo, for joining me on this existential crisis of a conversation. And for our listeners out there,
[00:48:15.410] 天哪，我真的准备好一辈子都做这件事了吗？诸如此类的问题。谢谢Jisoo和我一起进行这场关于存在主义危机的对话。也想对各位听众说：
