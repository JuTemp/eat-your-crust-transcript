[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。
[00:00:07.000]  Alright so we're going to switch things up a little bit and I will intro the Gen Z word slash sling word of the week.
[00:00:07.000] 好的，我们来稍微改变一下，我将介绍本周的 Z 世代流行语/俚语。
[00:00:23.000]  This is something that I found on TikTok in the comments actually where I just saw the comments of this one video.
[00:00:23.000] 这是我在TikTok上看到这个视频评论时发现的。
[00:00:30.000]  It was all this one phrase for the phrase today is lock in so the meaning of this word I think is somewhat easy to figure out it basically means you get into the zone,
[00:00:30.000] 今天我们用“lock in”这个词组来概括所有内容，所以我认为这个词的意思很容易理解，它基本上是指进入状态。
[00:00:43.000]  you kind of pull it together, you concentrate a little bit and you really lock in but the Know Your Mean page has some of the funniest memes I've ever seen.
[00:00:43.000] 你稍微集中精力，认真思考，然后真正投入进去，就会发现“Know Your Mean”页面上有一些我见过的最搞笑的表情包。
[00:00:52.000]  So one of them is when the face ID fucking up and I got a lock in and it has three emojis to which are crying emojis and the third one is just like a really sculptured defined face emoji which is so funny.
[00:00:52.000] 其中一个例子是面部识别出了问题，我的设备被锁定了，上面有三个表情符号，其中两个是哭泣的表情符号，第三个则是一个非常立体的脸部表情符号，这太搞笑了。
[00:01:05.000]  It's like I definitely have been there. The other one is when you're drunk as fuck in a 7-11 and you got to lock in to talk to the cashier.
[00:01:05.000] 感觉我肯定经历过那种事。还有一种情况是，你在7-11便利店里喝得烂醉，还得锁上门才能跟收银员说话。
[00:01:14.000]  Like both memes are actually you just instantly know what lock in means.
[00:01:14.000] 就像这两个梗图一样，你一眼就能明白“锁定”是什么意思。
[00:01:18.000]  I was surprised that this is like such a popular phrase now because you said you've been seeing it all over TikTok comments,
[00:01:18.000] 我很惊讶这句话现在这么流行，因为你说你在TikTok评论区到处都能看到它。
[00:01:25.000]  just like lock in, lock in because I kind of know it from gaming not even necessarily as a slang phrase but now that I think about it the nature of it is kind of slain.
[00:01:25.000] 就像锁定一样，锁定，因为我从游戏中就听说过它，甚至不一定是俚语，但现在想想，它的本质有点被扼杀了。
[00:01:39.000]  But whenever you're playing a game and you're losing and it's a team game it's very common to hear like all right everyone like lock in,
[00:01:39.000] 但是，每当你玩游戏输了，而且这还是个团队游戏时，你经常会听到这样的话：“好了，大家集中注意力！”
[00:01:46.000]  you know we're gonna turn this around, we're gonna start winning or maybe you're playing against someone they're like are I gotta like sit up now and like lock in play properly against you now.
[00:01:46.000] 你知道我们会扭转局面，我们会开始赢球，或者也许你正在和某人比赛，他们会说，我现在必须振作起来，好好和你比赛。
[00:01:56.000]  So that's kind of how I have heard it use in the past but I think the memes and the comments are really funny in all these real world situations.
[00:01:56.000] 我以前也听说过这种用法，但我认为在所有这些现实情境中，这些梗图和评论真的很有趣。
[00:02:06.000]  It's so relatable.
[00:02:06.000] 太有共鸣了。
[00:02:08.000]  Yeah, and I feel like what's also hilarious is I think you're right like this phrase specifically can be attributed to so many different situations.
[00:02:08.000] 是啊，我觉得更搞笑的是，你说得对，这句话确实可以用于很多不同的情境。
[00:02:17.000]  You're slacking a little bit and then suddenly you have to like really focus and put it together but the way the meme format is it's like I'm looking at one meme here on No Your Meme.
[00:02:17.000] 你稍微放松了一下，然后突然间你必须真正集中精力，把事情做好，但是表情包的格式就像我现在在 No Your Meme 上看到的一个表情包一样。
[00:02:26.000]  A picture of Mario looking goofy as hell.
[00:02:26.000] 一张马里奥看起来傻乎乎的照片。
[00:02:28.000]  And the next picture is literally Mario like staring into the I guess camera like the photo looking really stashed.
[00:02:28.000] 下一张照片简直就像马里奥盯着镜头一样，照片看起来很神秘。
[00:02:35.000]  I don't want this is so iconic.
[00:02:35.000] 我不想让它如此经典。
[00:02:38.000]  So funny.
[00:02:38.000] 太搞笑了。
[00:02:39.000]  What are examples of TikToks that you've seen the comments for?
[00:02:39.000] 你见过哪些TikTok视频的评论？
[00:02:43.000]  So I think you're right, I'm scrolling through TikTok and I see a bunch of like gamer ones but I see this one that's super funny.
[00:02:43.000] 所以我觉得你说得对，我在浏览TikTok的时候看到很多游戏相关的视频，但是我看到一个超级搞笑的视频。
[00:02:50.000]  It says POV, you're having a breakdown in your room and you start hearing footsteps so you have to lock it.
[00:02:50.000] 画面显示第一人称视角，你在房间里情绪崩溃，开始听到脚步声，所以你不得不把门锁上。
[00:02:55.000]  Oh my god.
[00:02:55.000]  我的天啊。
[00:02:56.000]  That's just so like this is the most relatable phrase I've ever heard in my entire life.
[00:02:56.000] 这句话简直太贴切了，是我这辈子听过最能引起共鸣的一句话。
[00:03:00.000]  Yeah.
[00:03:00.000]  是的。
[00:03:01.000]  There's so many moments where I'm like okay got to lock it.
[00:03:01.000] 有很多时候我都会想，好了，得把它锁起来了。
[00:03:03.000]  Yeah.
[00:03:03.000]  是的。
[00:03:04.000]  Oh my god, that's so funny.
[00:03:04.000] 我的天哪，这太搞笑了。
[00:03:05.000]  I can think of one like I feel like a lot of people can relate to this back in the day and in school when your parents aren't home from work yet and you're slacking but then you hear the garage door open.
[00:03:05.000] 我想到了一个例子，我觉得很多人都能感同身受，比如以前上学的时候，父母还没下班回家，你正在偷懒，这时你听到车库门开了。
[00:03:16.000]  Oh my god.
[00:03:16.000]  我的天啊。
[00:03:17.000]  Yeah. And your mom was like oh can you make the right or like can you defrost as you're like fuck?
[00:03:17.000] 是啊。然后你妈妈就说，哦，你能把东西弄好吗？或者你能解冻吗？你当时就想，操！
[00:03:22.000]  You got to lock it.
[00:03:22.000] 你得把它锁上。
[00:03:24.000]  And I feel like also back in high school when I told my mom I couldn't do something because I had to study and then I was just goofing off in my room and I hear footsteps.
[00:03:24.000] 我感觉就像回到了高中，当时我跟妈妈说我不能做某件事，因为我必须学习，然后我就在房间里闲逛，突然听到脚步声。
[00:03:31.000]  Got to lock it.
[00:03:31.000] 得把它锁上。
[00:03:32.000]  Yeah.
[00:03:32.000]  是的。
[00:03:33.000]  What a great phrase.
[00:03:33.000] 多么精辟的一句话。
[00:03:34.000]  I like that this is becoming popular.
[00:03:34.000] 我很高兴看到它越来越受欢迎。
[00:03:36.000]  Oh yeah, I'm a big fan.
[00:03:36.000] 哦，是的，我是你的忠实粉丝。
[00:03:38.000]  I think we should incorporate into our daily vocabulary.
[00:03:38.000] 我认为我们应该将它融入到日常词汇中。
[00:03:41.000]  Agreed.
[00:03:41.000] 同意。
[00:03:42.000]  It's so fun to use outside of the gaming context.
[00:03:42.000] 在游戏之外的场景下使用也很有趣。
[00:03:45.000]  Well I definitely know I'm going to be spending all my time flipping through lock in tic-tocs later but back to the podcast topic at hand today.
[00:03:45.000] 我知道我之后肯定会花很多时间浏览各种防疫信息，但还是回到今天播客的主题吧。
[00:03:55.000]  Today we wanted to really talk a little bit about the generational gap.
[00:03:55.000] 今天我们想好好聊聊代沟问题。
[00:04:00.000]  This one is specifically dedicated to our parents where we wanted to dive in a little bit about the differences and I guess attitude and sort of outlook on life or different aspects of life that we've been experiencing in terms of us versus our parents and how dealing with that has evolved over the years.
[00:04:00.000] 这篇文章专门献给我们的父母，我们想深入探讨一下我们和父母之间的差异，以及我们对生活的态度和看法，或者说我们经历的人生不同方面，以及这些年来我们是如何应对这些差异的。
[00:04:17.000]  I feel like almost all aspects of life there's potential conflicting viewpoints just because our backgrounds are so different.
[00:04:17.000] 我觉得生活中几乎所有方面都可能存在观点冲突，仅仅是因为我们的背景截然不同。
[00:04:27.000]  Things as basic as like friendships and then as complicated as like finances and career paths.
[00:04:27.000] 从友谊这样基本的事情，到财务和职业道路这样复杂的事情。
[00:04:33.000]  One example I can actually think of for friendships is and I think we might have mentioned this on the podcast before just as a random comment but I remember specifically when I was growing up my parents would say oh your high school friends aren't necessarily going to be your lifelong friends.
[00:04:33.000] 我能想到的关于友谊的一个例子是，我想我们之前可能在播客中随意提到过这一点，但我记得在我成长的过程中，我的父母会说，哦，你的高中朋友不一定会成为你一生的朋友。
[00:04:51.000]  You know when they said that I guess I didn't know how to react because I didn't know for sure.
[00:04:51.000] 你知道，当他们说那句话的时候，我猜我不知道该如何反应，因为我也不确定。
[00:04:57.000]  I was like I guess there's some like possibility to these words that they're saying but also like I don't know if that's going to be true for me either and then as we've grown older very interestingly at least for us and a lot of people just in the Bay Area in general.
[00:04:57.000] 我当时想，他们说的这些话或许有一定道理，但我也不知道这对我来说是否适用。随着我们年龄的增长，非常有趣的是，至少对我们以及湾区的很多人来说，情况都是如此。
[00:05:11.000]  We still continue to uphold our high school connections to a decent degree and just thinking about it why did my parents say that back in the day it makes so much sense because they literally left their home country and came to a new country across the world.
[00:05:11.000] 我们仍然在一定程度上与高中保持联系，仔细想想，我父母当年为什么会这么说，这很有道理，因为他们真的离开了自己的祖国，来到了地球另一端的新国家。
[00:05:28.000]  So of course you know they're not going to be as close with their high school friends as we would be because we're still in the same country that we've been growing up in for the most part of our lives.
[00:05:28.000] 所以，你当然知道，他们和高中朋友的关系不会像我们一样亲密，因为我们仍然生活在我们成长了大半辈子的同一个国家。
[00:05:42.000]  Yeah I feel like that angle makes discussing friendships so interesting and like different with our parents.
[00:05:42.000] 是的，我觉得从这个角度来谈论友谊会变得非常有趣，也和跟父母谈论友谊的方式很不一样。
[00:05:49.000]  I think what I feel too is like I wonder how much social media has changed the friendship landscape sort of.
[00:05:49.000] 我也觉得，社交媒体究竟在多大程度上改变了友谊的格局。
[00:05:58.000]  I know back in our parents age I think by the time they were in their late 20s early 30s email was probably starting to gain traction so at least they had something that wasn't just phone calls and snail mail but it's like there's nothing so convenient like social media where you can keep up with people without having to actually keep up with them.
[00:05:58.000] 我知道在我们父母那个年代，大概在他们二十七八岁到三十出头的时候，电子邮件可能开始流行起来，所以至少他们除了打电话和寄信之外还有其他联系方式。但是现在好像没有什么比社交媒体更方便的了，你可以和别人保持联系，而不用真的去和他们联系。
[00:06:17.000]  I know what's going on in people's lives without having like personally contacted them in a long time I still makes me feel connected to them.
[00:06:17.000] 即使很久没有亲自联系过别人，我仍然知道他们生活中发生了什么，这让我感觉与他们保持着联系。
[00:06:26.000]  So then I feel like I have a much more maybe like a lighter view on friendship than my parents who they needed like that international commitment to upkeep their friendships.
[00:06:26.000] 所以我觉得我对友谊的看法可能比我的父母轻松得多，他们为了维持友谊需要付出国际性的承诺。
[00:06:37.000]  That's such a good point you explaining that is totally making me realize how much I take for granted our connectivity.
[00:06:37.000] 你说的这一点太好了，你的解释让我彻底意识到我以前是多么理所当然地享受着我们的网络连接。
[00:06:45.000]  I'm just imagining that we could only communicate by snail mail or phones maybe like landlines.
[00:06:45.000] 我只是想象我们只能通过邮寄信件或电话（比如固定电话）进行交流。
[00:06:53.000]  I'm sure international calls are just crazy expensive snail mail like what if someone moves then your mail gets bounced back to you like you don't know if it'll reach them if they don't update with the post office and all of that kind of stuff and it'll take so much time for it to bounce back to like what if they moved again.
[00:06:53.000] 我敢肯定国际长途电话就像寄慢邮件一样贵得离谱。如果有人搬家了，你的邮件就会被退回来，你也不知道邮件能不能送到，如果他们不更新邮局的信息，等等等等，而且邮件退回来要花很长时间，如果他们再次搬家怎么办？
[00:07:13.000]  It's just like so complicated and you know it's crazy also that reminds me my mom and dad shared a story with me before that do you remember those chain mails that we would get.
[00:07:13.000] 这事儿太复杂了，而且你知道，这简直太疯狂了。这让我想起我爸妈以前跟我讲过的一个故事，你还记得我们收到的那些连锁邮件吗？
[00:07:23.000]  Yeah, like send this on to X amount of people or else you'll have bad luck for the rest of your life or whatever our parents got that except snail mail version.
[00:07:23.000] 是啊，就像把这个转发给 X 个人，否则你这辈子都会倒霉之类的，我们父母那一代人也收到过类似的说法，只不过是邮寄版的。
[00:07:31.000]  Do so that to hand right copies. Oh my god wild that's labor. Oh my god it really is like I hope they only had to send it out to five people imagine 20 yeah maybe they kept it back then now Jen alpha probably gets those and it's like sent to a thousand of your best friends.
[00:07:31.000] 这样做是为了确保每份副本都正确无误。我的天哪，这工作量也太大了。我的天哪，真的太费劲了。我希望他们只需要寄给五个人，想想二十个，是啊，也许他们当时自己留着，现在珍妮弗·阿尔法可能收到了，然后就像寄给了你一千个最好的朋友一样。
[00:07:50.000]  I feel like it was also crazy to me is sometimes I think about this when I watched older sort of like retro vibe dramas. I feel like people were maybe a little bit less private back then because my mom told me some story about how this person from our high school really wanted to get in touch with her but my mom had already moved away to like soul.
[00:07:50.000] 我觉得这事儿挺不可思议的，有时候我看一些老剧，尤其是那种复古风格的剧，就会想到这一点。感觉那时候的人可能没那么注重隐私，因为我妈跟我讲过一个故事，说我们高中有个同学特别想联系她，但我妈当时已经搬走了。
[00:08:09.000]  So no then that person visited my mom's childhood home and like knocked on the door and spoke to my mom's mom's on my grandma. And I was like, oh where's you know my insert mom's name here like I want to talk to her can I get her contact information because I guess it makes sense right like you couldn't really Google someone back then.
[00:08:09.000] 所以，那个人去了我妈妈小时候住的地方，敲了敲门，跟我外婆（也就是我奶奶）说了话。我就问，哦，你知道我妈妈（此处插入她的名字）在哪儿吗？我想跟她聊聊，能不能给我她的联系方式？因为那时候好像不像现在这样能用谷歌搜索。
[00:08:29.000]  Right but now I'm just like dude if someone from my high school came to my mom's house and like knocked on the door and asked for my contact info.
[00:08:29.000] 没错，但我现在就想，如果我高中同学来我家敲门，问我要联系方式，我会怎么办？
[00:08:37.000]  I would be so creeped out like that would be a huge invasion of privacy.
[00:08:37.000] 我会觉得非常毛骨悚然，这简直是对隐私的严重侵犯。
[00:08:42.000]  I yeah I feel like my parents would be like who are you like are you a serial killer what is this new tactic.
[00:08:42.000] 是啊，我觉得我父母会问：你是谁？你是连环杀手吗？这又是什么新伎俩？
[00:08:50.000]  Honestly even now when someone knocks on our front door I always check via ring to like see who it is but I think back then it was kind of normal to get knocks on the door and like open the door and talk to people.
[00:08:50.000] 说实话，即使现在有人敲我们家前门，我也会通过门铃查看是谁，但我觉得那时候有人敲门，然后开门和人交谈是很正常的事。
[00:09:01.000]  Yeah agreed I mean even for me I remember before the age of pretty much eight.
[00:09:01.000] 是的，同意。我的意思是，即使对我来说，我记得大概八岁之前就记得了。
[00:09:11.000]  We would just open the door if someone knocked on the like ring or double maybe it was my neighbor and you know it was a lot more like spontaneous like I don't know
[00:09:11.000] 如果有人敲门，我们就会直接开门，可能是铃响或者两声，也许是邻居，你知道，那时候更像是即兴的，我也不知道。
[00:09:21.000]  someone is going to come knock on the door to ask to like hang out or go play on the streets or whatever but now it's like hey I'm going to come to your house at five p.m.
[00:09:21.000] 以前会有人来敲门，问能不能一起出去玩或者去街上玩耍什么的，但现在变成了：嘿，我下午五点要来你家。
[00:09:30.000]  And then sometimes we're just like okay like don't even ring the doorbell just text me when you're here.
[00:09:30.000] 然后有时候我们就会说，好吧，别按门铃了，到了就给我发个短信。
[00:09:35.000]  I think there's many layers of communication before people come but truly back then it was like kids would bike over and like knock and be like oh can you see a play.
[00:09:35.000] 我认为在人们到来之前有很多层沟通，但实际上，那时候就像孩子们骑着自行车过来敲门，然后说，哦，你们能来看戏吗？
[00:09:42.000]  I just like can't imagine that anymore.
[00:09:42.000] 我简直无法想象那种事了。
[00:09:45.000]  Absolutely not.
[00:09:45.000] 绝对不是。
[00:09:47.000]  We're all like cowering in fear when the doorbell rings pull out our phones check the camera like could it be.
[00:09:47.000] 门铃响起时，我们都吓得瑟瑟发抖，掏出手机查看摄像头，心想：会不会是……
[00:09:54.000]  I guess a little bit different from friendships but still kind of similar is relationships.
[00:09:54.000] 我觉得恋爱关系和友谊有点不同，但又有些相似之处。
[00:10:00.000]  I remember having a lot of conversations with my parents about relationships and I think the attitudes that they held about dating at a younger age were not too different from mine.
[00:10:00.000] 我记得小时候和父母谈过很多关于恋爱的话题，我觉得他们年轻时对恋爱的态度和我的并没有太大的不同。
[00:10:11.000]  I was kind of like okay date a bunch of people to see what is the best fit and move forward from there.
[00:10:11.000] 我当时的想法是，好吧，先和很多人约会，看看谁最适合我，然后再从那里开始下一步。
[00:10:17.000]  But I do feel like my parents have a very specific idea about marriage.
[00:10:17.000] 但我确实觉得我的父母对婚姻有非常具体的看法。
[00:10:22.000]  They were like oh if you're sure that James is the one you guys should marry the sooner or the better versus now I feel like in our generation it is a little bit more like paste out.
[00:10:22.000] 他们当时说，哦，如果你确定詹姆斯就是你的真命天子，你们就应该尽快结婚，而不是像现在这样，我觉得我们这一代人结婚更像是草率行事。
[00:10:32.000]  It's not like oh as soon as he's the one get married it's more like get me on your own time like I know some people have been dating for a very long time
[00:10:32.000] 这并不是说，一旦他成为我的真命天子就得结婚，而是说，你们应该顺其自然，我知道有些人已经交往很久了。
[00:10:40.000]  and do not prioritize marriage because of logistical things.
[00:10:40.000] 不要因为实际操作上的原因而将婚姻放在首位。
[00:10:44.000]  And I feel like that's a huge difference from our parents generation for sure.
[00:10:44.000] 我觉得这和我们父母那一代人肯定有很大的不同。
[00:10:48.000]  Oh so your parents actually encouraged you to date when you were younger?
[00:10:48.000] 哦，所以你小时候父母其实鼓励你谈恋爱？
[00:10:53.000]  Yeah I think like by the time I was in college they were like oh you should try to date a bunch of people and see.
[00:10:53.000] 是的，我觉得到了我上大学的时候，他们会说，哦，你应该多和一些人约会看看。
[00:11:01.000]  Oh interesting.
[00:11:01.000] 哦，有意思。
[00:11:04.000]  I feel like my parents never had a very explicit stance on dating but it was mainly just pre-college don't date.
[00:11:04.000] 我觉得我的父母对恋爱从来没有非常明确的立场，但主要就是大学之前不要谈恋爱。
[00:11:14.000]  Like focus on studying.
[00:11:14.000] 比如专注于学习。
[00:11:16.000]  But also as I think about it now comparing our generation to parents generation, it's a lot more likely you know kind of based on what we were just talking about with friendships.
[00:11:16.000] 但是现在想想，如果我们这一代和父母那一代相比，可能会发现，就像我们刚才谈到友谊时那样，我们这一代更有可能……
[00:11:28.000]  And more likely that we can keep in contact with you know high school friends and things like that so we see a lot of like high school sweethearts.
[00:11:28.000] 而且我们更有可能与高中朋友保持联系，诸如此类，所以我们经常看到高中时的恋人。
[00:11:37.000]  And I feel like in our parents generation maybe they didn't see as many of relationships like that just because once again having immigrated out of their home country cuts off a lot of connections for a while.
[00:11:37.000] 我觉得我们父母那一代人可能没见过那么多这样的关系，因为移民离开祖国后，很多人与外界的联系会在一段时间内断绝。
[00:11:51.000]  I think that kind of plays into the whole generation gap friendships and relationships.
[00:11:51.000] 我认为这与代沟造成的友谊和人际关系有关。
[00:11:57.000]  Whoa that's kind of like mind blowing actually although I feel like in Korea I have to wonder if mandatory military service has something to do with less high school sweethearts because men do have to go away for I think it's like a year and a half ish now to serve.
[00:11:57.000] 哇，这真是令人震惊。虽然我觉得在韩国，强制兵役制度可能与高中恋人较少有关，因为男性确实需要离开一段时间去服役，我想现在大概是一年半左右。
[00:12:15.000]  And I think that kind of can put a damper on like a new relationship of like do I really want to wait for this guy for a year and a half but interestingly on my mom's side every single couple so four of the five siblings are married to their CC.
[00:12:15.000] 我觉得这可能会给一段新的恋情泼冷水，比如我真的要等这个人一年半吗？但有趣的是，我妈妈那边的每一对夫妇，五个兄弟姐妹中的四个都和他们的CC结婚了。
[00:12:32.000]  So like CC is kind of like campus couple so they're all college sweethearts except my parents.
[00:12:32.000] 所以 CC 就像校园情侣一样，除了我父母以外，他们都是大学恋人。
[00:12:38.000]  Actually my parents are also like a college couple but they got together much later.
[00:12:38.000] 其实我父母也像是一对大学情侣，只不过他们在一起的时间晚了很多。
[00:12:46.000]  If I'm remembering right it was either like towards the end of college or maybe like right after graduating that they got together so it's kind of late in their life that they got together but then like once they got together everything was like bam and bam like leave the country together you know have kids like all that stuff it was like things just started happening.
[00:12:46.000] 如果我没记错的话，他们大概是在大学快毕业的时候，或者毕业后不久才走到一起的，所以他们在一起的时间其实有点晚了，但是一旦他们在一起，一切就进展得非常顺利，比如一起离开这个国家，生孩子等等，就像所有的事情都突然发生了一样。
[00:13:06.000]  So yeah in that sense my parents were always like don't date in high school but I was like um why not.
[00:13:06.000] 所以，从这个意义上讲，我的父母总是说不要在高中谈恋爱，但我当时想，嗯，为什么不呢？
[00:13:14.000]  I guess to be fair my parents weren't like encouraging me to date in high school but they would say off hand shit like oh it's just a high school boyfriend like just anything.
[00:13:14.000] 公平地说，我父母并没有鼓励我高中谈恋爱，但他们会随口说些诸如“哦，只是个高中男朋友”之类的话。
[00:13:24.000]  Yeah and then I'll be like don't be so dismissive of my lifestyle.
[00:13:24.000] 是啊，然后我就会说，别对我的生活方式如此不屑一顾。
[00:13:31.000]  And then I think in college though my parents never really said anything about dating so there was never any pressure to date people but I guess for them maybe in their mind it was also just like oh you should probably focus on graduating and I guess if you meet someone then good for you but otherwise just focus on living and surviving and studying.
[00:13:31.000] 不过我觉得，在大学里，我的父母从来没有真正谈论过约会的事情，所以从来没有给我任何约会的压力。但我想，在他们看来，也许他们的想法是，你应该专注于毕业，如果你遇到了某个人，那很好，否则就专注于生活、生存和学习。
[00:13:55.000]  Dude yeah taking care of yourself is already like a huge struggle. I called it.
[00:13:55.000] 兄弟，是啊，照顾好自己就已经很不容易了。我早就料到了。
[00:14:00.000]  I wonder if maybe my parents were like oh date other people because I used to do this thing where I would like date one person be like he's the one until I actually found the one who is James but I feel like my parents were like why are you so serious about it?
[00:14:00.000] 我怀疑我父母是不是觉得我应该多和其他人约会，因为我以前经常这样，和一个人约会，觉得他就是我的真命天子，直到我真正遇到詹姆斯。但我感觉我父母可能觉得你为什么这么认真？
[00:14:13.000]  Date more than like one person. I'm so clear if that's the one or not.
[00:14:13.000] 我喜欢和不止一个人约会。我很清楚那个人是不是我的真命天子。
[00:14:17.000]  Well did your parents date more than one person so my mom I secretly told me that she has but she tells my dad she hasn't.
[00:14:17.000] 你父母有没有和不止一个人谈过恋爱？我妈偷偷告诉我她谈过，但她却跟我爸说她没有。
[00:14:27.000]  Oh my dad knows but he I think he just doesn't want to know right then my dad claims to this day that my mom was his first love but none of us believe him.
[00:14:27.000] 哦，我爸爸知道，但他好像只是不想知道。直到今天，我爸爸还声称我妈妈是他的初恋，但我们谁也不相信他。
[00:14:37.000]  Dude okay my dad also said something like that and I was like are you sure wait did your parents go to like gender specific middle school high school elementary schools.
[00:14:37.000] 兄弟，好吧，我爸也说过类似的话，我就问你确定吗？等等，你爸妈是不是上的是那种按性别分校的初中、高中、小学？
[00:14:48.000]  I don't think so so my parents grew up in the same city and they ended up going to the same university which was in the same city that they grew up in.
[00:14:48.000] 我不这么认为，我的父母在同一个城市长大，最终也上了同一所大学，而这所大学也位于他们长大的同一个城市。
[00:14:57.000]  So my parents actually went to the same school since junior high but they just didn't know each other until college but they knew of each other at some point.
[00:14:57.000] 实际上，我的父母从初中起就在同一所学校就读，但直到大学才彼此认识，不过他们之前就听说过对方。
[00:15:08.000]  So I was always like being an annoying kid at once I knew this I was like oh my god like did you look over in junior high and think like wow that that boys gonna be my future husband and I'm almost like no what the fuck.
[00:15:08.000] 所以，我一直都像个烦人的孩子，我知道这一点，我当时想，哦我的天哪，你是不是在初中时就看着别人，心想哇，那个男孩会成为我未来的丈夫，而我几乎想，不，这他妈的是什么。
[00:15:23.000]  Wait that's so cute though it's like hometown lovers.
[00:15:23.000] 等等，这也太可爱了吧，就像是同乡恋人一样。
[00:15:27.000]  Yeah but they didn't become friends and then like boyfriend girlfriend until much later in their lives.
[00:15:27.000] 是的，但他们直到人生后期才成为朋友，然后发展成男女朋友关系。
[00:15:36.000]  It's cute in concept but reality is like oh I didn't care about this person until we became friends but I do think that my parents didn't date that much before they got together.
[00:15:36.000] 这个想法很可爱，但现实是，哦，我一开始并不在乎这个人，直到我们成为朋友，但我确实认为我的父母在在一起之前并没有约会过很多次。
[00:15:50.000]  Like very minimally so it's possible that they just didn't date at all seriously until they found each other and it's also possible that like maybe there was one or two but regardless I think it's very interesting because in a sense if your parents are each others just like one and only first and only I guess.
[00:15:50.000] 就像关系非常疏远，所以他们可能在遇到彼此之前根本没有认真谈过恋爱，也可能有过一两次恋爱，但无论如何，我认为这很有趣，因为从某种意义上说，如果你的父母是彼此的唯一，那么他们就是彼此的唯一。
[00:16:13.000]  They might actually have less dating experience than like you.
[00:16:13.000] 他们的恋爱经验可能比你少。
[00:16:19.000]  Oh yeah I think theoretically if both of them were telling the truth then that would be the case right and isn't that kind of crazy to think about.
[00:16:19.000] 哦，是啊，我想理论上讲，如果他们俩都说真话，那情况就是那样，对吧？这么想是不是有点疯狂？
[00:16:29.000]  I guess so I mean I feel like it kind of makes sense to me though because I feel like each generation is more progressive and part of that progressiveness I feel like also bleeds into like.
[00:16:29.000] 我想也是，我的意思是，我觉得这对我来说有点道理，因为我觉得每一代人都更加进步，而这种进步的一部分我觉得也渗透到了其他方面。
[00:16:43.000]  I think that's how we see dating and stuff but I guess on the flip side I feel like dating attitudes have changed a lot at least like my Korean American attitude towards dating is very different from I think what my parents had because I think by the time my parents had gotten together my dad was going on dates kind of specifically to get married.
[00:16:43.000] 我觉得这就是我们看待约会的方式，但另一方面，我觉得人们对约会的态度已经发生了很大的变化，至少我作为韩裔美国人的约会态度与我的父母截然不同，因为我觉得在我父母走到一起的时候，我父亲约会的目的就是为了结婚。
[00:17:03.000]  Korea they call it as fun but it's really just like okay these are two people who are hoping to get married soon so like you guys should go on a date and then they'll let people will set it up like that.
[00:17:03.000] 在韩国，他们称之为乐趣，但实际上就像是，好吧，这是两个希望尽快结婚的人，所以你们应该去约会，然后他们会安排人这样安排。
[00:17:13.000]  So then I feel like in that way he probably went on a bunch of blind dates like that but for me it's like I would want to marry someone who I love after like months and months of dating versus like trying to kind of be run it.
[00:17:13.000] 所以我觉得他可能那样参加过很多次相亲，但对我来说，我更想和自己爱的人交往几个月后再结婚，而不是被别人牵着鼻子走。
[00:17:27.000]  I mean it worked out well for my parents and it's I guess unfair to be like they speedrun it but I feel like the way I see it is like my dad had a priority of like getting married soon but probably by a specific age versus I don't know if I would have had that same thought I guess.
[00:17:27.000] 我的意思是，这对我的父母来说很成功，说他们速成结婚可能不太公平，但我觉得我父亲的首要任务是尽快结婚，而且可能要等到某个特定的年龄，而我不知道我是否也会有同样的想法。
[00:17:43.000]  Yeah I think my parents probably had a similar thought like oh like we should get married soon because I think my parents got married after like a year of dating and I was like that's crazy.
[00:17:43.000] 是的，我觉得我父母可能也有过类似的想法，比如我们应该尽快结婚，因为我记得他们交往一年左右就结婚了，当时我就觉得这太疯狂了。
[00:17:56.000]  Yeah I'm like there's no way. I think I remember because my previous relationship was relatively long and at one point my dad was like oh you guys have been dating for a while like shouldn't you get married soon and I was like dude what?
[00:17:56.000] 是啊，我当时就想，不可能。我记得是因为我上一段感情持续了比较长的时间，有一次我爸说，你们俩交往这么久了，是不是该结婚了？我当时就懵了，什么？
[00:18:12.000]  I'm so young like what are you talking about?
[00:18:12.000] 我还这么年轻，你在说什么呢？
[00:18:16.000]  Right and he was like well you shouldn't wait too long regardless because and then he like goes on and on about like these ideals and I'm like I guess but also like what if I'm just not ready like I'm not at the age to marry yet.
[00:18:16.000] 对，他说，不管怎样你都不应该等太久，因为……然后他就滔滔不绝地讲这些理想，我就想，我明白了，但是如果我还没准备好呢？如果我还没到结婚的年龄呢？
[00:18:30.000]  And he's like sooner than later at least.
[00:18:30.000] 而且他觉得至少很快就会这么做。
[00:18:34.000]  I am kind of curious like I wish sometimes I could time travel and see my parents when they were young because I feel like Loki there's a lot of tea and gas that they're not sharing or they'll like bread crumb it.
[00:18:34.000] 我有点好奇，有时候我希望能够穿越时空去看看我的父母年轻的时候，因为我觉得就像洛基一样，他们有很多茶和气体没有分享，或者他们会像面包屑一样把它藏起来。
[00:18:44.000]  But apparently when my mom was just starting to date my dad my grandma was throwing a huge fit because my mom had allegedly said that she didn't want to get married.
[00:18:44.000] 但显然，当我妈妈刚开始和我爸爸约会时，我的奶奶大发雷霆，因为我妈妈据说说过她不想结婚。
[00:18:55.000]  And then my grandma was like I'm sick right now like you don't know how much longer I'll be alive spoiler alert she's literally still alive to this day.
[00:18:55.000] 然后我奶奶说她现在病得很重，不知道还能活多久。剧透一下，她至今仍然健在。
[00:19:04.000]  I don't want to pass before I'm able to see get married like you're being a bad daughter there was a bunch of parental pressure but I guess I found it also shocking that my mom was like I don't want to get married.
[00:19:04.000] 我不想在结婚前就去世，感觉自己像个坏女儿。父母给我施加了很多压力，但让我感到震惊的是，我妈妈竟然说她不想结婚。
[00:19:15.000]  I have this conception of like people back then they want to get married ASAP but it's like if you kind of dive into the details at least for my mom like she was sort of resistant to the idea in the first place.
[00:19:15.000] 我一直觉得那时候的人们都想尽快结婚，但如果你深入了解细节，就会发现至少我妈妈一开始是有点抗拒结婚的。
[00:19:25.000]  Whoa that is very fascinating wow yeah I have no idea what my parents take is I can totally imagine a lot of people maybe even married out of convenience during our parents generation, especially if they're in a hurry to say like leave the country.
[00:19:25.000] 哇，这太有趣了！是啊，我完全不知道我父母是怎么想的。我完全可以想象，在我们父母那一代，很多人可能只是为了方便而结婚，特别是如果他们急着离开这个国家的话。
[00:19:44.000]  Right then maybe they're like oh it would be really nice if I had a supportive partner who can go through all the files and tribulations were about to face you know figure it out as we go.
[00:19:44.000] 这时他们可能会想，哦，如果我有一个支持我的伴侣，可以和我一起梳理所有文件，一起面对即将面临的磨难，边走边想办法，那该多好啊。
[00:19:56.000]  But then for us it's all about like no I have to love them and I have to feel like perfect and like fit in my life and all that kind of stuff.
[00:19:56.000] 但对我们来说，一切都关乎于“不，我必须爱他们，我必须感觉自己很完美，感觉自己融入了我的生活等等”。
[00:20:05.000]  Right so actually when I was traveling recently I hung out with a friend who I haven't seen in a while and she was basically saying that she has kind of like an internal clock of I have to date for X number of years before I get married to someone.
[00:20:05.000] 没错，其实我最近旅行的时候，和一位很久没见的朋友聚了聚，她基本上是这么说的：她心里有个时钟，必须谈恋爱 X 年才能结婚。
[00:20:19.000]  And I found that very interesting because kind of like what I was saying I feel like there's a certain preconception I have of maybe views on marriage and stuff are still a little bit more old fashioned in Asia than it is in the US for example but for her to kind of say that I was like I'm not sure if I can get married.
[00:20:19.000] 我觉得这很有意思，因为就像我刚才说的，我觉得我对亚洲的婚姻观念可能比美国要老旧一些，但她说出那样的话后，我就不确定自己能不能结婚了。
[00:20:34.000]  I think that's why I think it's a very important thing to say about that is that I was like oh I guess it is kind of a real generation thing where nowadays people do have that fantasy of well in a date for however many years before getting married whereas before there was probably more of an emphasis on like you have to be married before this age.
[00:20:34.000] 我认为这就是为什么我觉得有必要说出来的原因，因为我当时想，哦，我想这其实是一种代沟现象，现在的人们确实有那种幻想，在结婚前先约会几年，而以前人们可能更强调你必须在某个年龄之前结婚。
[00:20:50.000]  I think there's also the whole thing about it being more common that people want to move in first before they get married to kind of have a little trial run there and make sure that you're able to work it out when you're living together before jumping into it right after marriage and then being like wait but then a lot of Asian American immigrant parents don't love that they're kind of like well if you're going to move in together why not just get married.
[00:20:50.000] 我觉得还有一点就是，现在很多人更倾向于先同居再结婚，这样可以先试水，确保彼此相处融洽，然后再考虑结婚后是否真的能好好生活。但是很多亚裔美国移民父母并不喜欢这样，他们会想，既然你们要同居，为什么不直接结婚呢？
[00:21:18.000]  I mean like I don't know about you but for my parents if say like my partner is visiting our house they'll be like well you're not married so maybe you shouldn't share a bed under our roof and they're like sorry we're just a little old fashioned.
[00:21:18.000] 我的意思是，我不知道你们怎么样，但就我父母而言，如果我的伴侣来我们家做客，他们会说，你们还没结婚，所以也许你们不应该在我们家同床共枕，他们会说，对不起，我们只是有点老派。
[00:21:35.000]  Dude that takes me back to when James visited my parents and stayed over for like a week it was like his first time sleeping over at our place and then my mom was like I'll prep the bed for him in the base.
[00:21:35.000] 老兄，这让我想起了詹姆斯来我家拜访，在我们家住了大概一个星期，那是他第一次在我们家过夜，然后我妈就说，我要在基地里给他铺好床。
[00:21:47.000]  And I was like what the fuck like we've been dating for five years already like Shirley you're okay like we literally live together at this point but a couple years prior I guess this would have been when James and I were dating for three years.
[00:21:47.000] 我当时就想，这他妈到底是怎么回事？我们已经交往五年了，雪莉，你没事吧？我们现在都住在一起了，但几年前，我想这应该是我和詹姆斯交往三年的时候。
[00:22:00.000]  We did our Asia trips together so you and Avi were with us for a leg and then we eventually split off and James and I went to visit his dad and his dad booked us a hotel and when we walked in it was two twin beds.
[00:22:00.000] 我们一起去了亚洲，所以你和艾维跟我们一起去了一段，然后我们最终分开了，詹姆斯和我去拜访他的父亲，他的父亲给我们订了一家酒店，当我们走进去的时候，发现里面是两张单人床。
[00:22:14.000]  Did you push them together or did you actually sleep on the separate I think we actually just slept separately honestly it was kind of nice but I was like that's hilarious yeah.
[00:22:14.000] 你们是把他们挤在一起睡，还是分开睡？我觉得我们其实是分开睡的，老实说感觉还不错，但我当时就觉得这太搞笑了。
[00:22:26.000]  I mean I know a couple of my friends who have been dating for like almost ten years now up until actually still pretty recently sometimes their parents would just be like um yeah we prepped the guest room for so and so but then there was like one point that kind of thing.
[00:22:26.000] 我的意思是，我认识几个朋友，他们交往快十年了，直到最近，他们的父母有时还会说，嗯，是的，我们为某某准备了客房，但后来有那么一段时间，发生了类似的事情。
[00:22:43.000]  Point that kind of changed everything and then after that was like okay I guess you can sleep in the same bed I think it was something like they were all visiting family member and that person was like oh like you two can just sleep together because we don't have room anyway.
[00:22:43.000] 这件事改变了一切，之后就好像……好吧，我想你们可以睡同一张床了。我想当时的情况是，他们都在拜访亲戚，那个人说，哦，你们两个可以睡在一起，反正我们也没有地方了。
[00:22:57.000]  And then after the parents just saw them sleeping together in the same bed things shifted after that is like okay I guess you guys can share that under our roof you did it once so like whatever yeah.
[00:22:57.000] 然后，在父母看到他们睡在同一张床上之后，事情就发生了变化，就像是“好吧，我想你们可以在我们家一起睡，你们已经睡过一次了，所以随便吧”。
[00:23:10.000]  I feel like at least the way that I communicate with my parents sometimes or like the way I've seen my parents communicate about these things there's just so many things that are kind of vague or like left unsaid or purposely obscured and it makes me feel a little bit weird about it because I feel like in the US it's very normal to be like oh yeah we live together but even when I'm in the US when I talk to relatives for example I feel like sometimes I have to check with my parents like oh do they know we live together
[00:23:10.000] 我觉得至少在我跟父母沟通的方式上，或者说我看到他们谈论这些事情的方式上，有很多事情都含糊不清，或者被刻意回避，这让我感觉有点怪怪的。因为我觉得在美国，说“哦，我们住在一起”是很正常的事，但即使我在美国，比如跟亲戚聊天的时候，我有时也得问问我父母，他们知不知道我们住在一起。
[00:23:39.000]  should I not talk about it and just make sure that they're cool with it and obviously it's different now that we're married but there's been a lot of times where I'm like about to be like oh yeah we live together and then my dad or my mom cut in they're like oh you know they live like 10 minutes from each other so it's really close and I'm like what the fuck we've literally been living together for like four plus years.
[00:23:39.000] 我是不是应该别提这件事，只要确保他们不介意就行了？当然，现在我们结婚了，情况肯定不一样了。但很多时候，我正要说“哦，是的，我们住在一起”，然后我爸妈就插嘴说“哦，你知道吗，他们住的地方离我们只有10分钟路程，所以很近”，我就想“什么鬼？我们明明已经住在一起四年多了”。
[00:24:02.000]  You're like I guess his office is five minutes from the bedroom.
[00:24:02.000] 你会想，我猜他的办公室离卧室只有五分钟路程。
[00:24:07.600]  Yeah and it gets all weird because I think it was happy news when James and I bought a house and then I was kind of like oh like I'm excited to like maybe talk about it or like whatever
[00:24:07.600] 是啊，事情变得很奇怪，因为我觉得我和詹姆斯买房是件好事，然后我就有点兴奋，想跟别人聊聊这件事什么的。
[00:24:16.760]  And then because they like no one can know that we live together I was like they were like oh what what have you been up to and I'm like nothing.
[00:24:16.760] 然后因为他们觉得不能让任何人知道我们住在一起，我就问他们：“哦，你们最近在忙什么？” 我说：“没什么。”
[00:24:24.320]  You're like still living in that apartment in your own cup of tea.
[00:24:24.320] 你就像还住在自己的公寓里，沉浸在自己的茶杯里一样。
[00:24:30.480]  No dude I remember once at this dinner they were like oh how's your apartment is it nice how much do you pay and then I almost said like the actual event
[00:24:30.480] 不，兄弟，我记得有一次在一次晚宴上，他们问我：“哦，你的公寓怎么样？好吗？每月租金多少？”然后我差点脱口而出：“我是说，那次晚宴真的发生过吗？”
[00:24:40.080]  that I was paying splitting the James and then I was like well I guess I still not really fair so like during dinner I was like how much should I scale down our
[00:24:40.080] 我当时是和詹姆斯平分餐，然后我就想，好吧，我还是不太公平，所以晚饭的时候我就想，我应该把我们的餐费减少多少？
[00:24:47.400]  rent so that it makes like reasonable sense in terms of the story of me allegedly living by myself and I was like this is too much math
[00:24:47.400] 租金要符合我“独自居住”的说法才合理，但我当时就想，这计算量也太大了。
[00:24:55.240]  like I just want to be able to talk about it.
[00:24:55.240] 我只是想找个人谈谈这件事。
[00:24:57.720]  You're like let me pull up Zillow real quick what is a reasonable rent price to say out loud at this table?
[00:24:57.720] 你会想：让我赶紧打开 Zillow 网站，在餐桌上公开说一下，合理的租金价格是多少？
[00:25:04.440]  Exactly. That's pretty funny but actually recently my brother moved in with his girlfriend.
[00:25:04.440] 没错。这挺搞笑的，不过我哥哥最近确实搬去和他女朋友同住了。
[00:25:14.680]  My parents were really chill about it so I was like whoa I guess my parents have come around
[00:25:14.680] 我父母对这件事的态度非常冷静，所以我就想，哇，看来我父母终于接受了这件事。
[00:25:20.280]  but I think my parents I have asked them about it before.
[00:25:20.280] 但我认为我之前已经问过我父母这个问题了。
[00:25:24.600]  They said a couple living together before marriage they can handle that but if they live together for too long
[00:25:24.600] 他们说，如果一对情侣婚前同居，他们可以接受，但如果同居时间过长就不行了。
[00:25:33.000]  before marriage then they start feeling a little iffy about it like oh well if you live together for so long
[00:25:33.000] 婚前他们会开始有点犹豫，比如，如果你们要同居这么久的话。
[00:25:39.400]  why don't you just get married already right and so I was like okay
[00:25:39.400] 你为什么不干脆结婚呢？所以我就想，好吧。
[00:25:43.720]  good to know I guess. That's really interesting. I wonder if even our parents thoughts about the
[00:25:43.720] 知道了就好。这真有趣。我想知道，就连我们的父母对……的看法如何？
[00:25:50.600]  concept of marriage and our thoughts about the concept of marriage are different because sometimes
[00:25:50.600] 婚姻的概念和我们对婚姻概念的看法可能有所不同，因为有时
[00:25:55.800]  I feel like it's almost like a logistical concept to them of like well you might as well be made
[00:25:55.800] 我觉得对他们来说，这几乎就像是一个逻辑概念，就好像“好吧，你最好还是被制造出来”。
[00:26:01.960]  or you should get married because blah blah whereas for us it's kind of like a fantasy almost.
[00:26:01.960] 或者你应该结婚，因为等等等等，而对我们来说，这几乎就像一个幻想。
[00:26:07.560]  Oh yeah maybe. So here is where a concept that I learned recently from my therapist really comes in.
[00:26:07.560] 哦，也许吧。这正契合了我最近从心理咨询师那里学到的一个概念。
[00:26:17.240]  I thought this was super profound so my therapist said that this is very common among like
[00:26:17.240] 我觉得这非常深刻，所以我的治疗师说这种情况在很多人当中很常见。
[00:26:23.400]  immigrants and children of immigrants basically the immigrating generation they're experiencing a lot
[00:26:23.400] 移民及其子女，基本上就是移民一代，他们正在经历很多。
[00:26:30.680]  of change. They're literally you know leaving home going to a brand new country learning a new
[00:26:30.680] 改变。他们真的要离开家，去到一个全新的国家，学习新的生活方式。
[00:26:36.360]  language etc etc so they're experiencing a lot of change and so what they search for is stability
[00:26:36.360] 语言等等，所以他们正在经历很多变化，因此他们寻求的是稳定。
[00:26:43.000]  and so I can see how in this situation like marriage is a form of stability and like kind of more
[00:26:43.000] 所以我能理解，在这种情况下，婚姻是一种稳定的形式，而且更像是一种保障。
[00:26:49.880]  logistical like you just said. And then us being like the children of immigrants we live in the
[00:26:49.880] 就像你刚才说的，后勤方面的问题。还有我们这些移民的后代，生活在……
[00:26:56.600]  stability that they've created and searched for all their lives so since we already have this
[00:26:56.600] 他们一生都在创造和追求稳定，既然我们已经拥有了这种稳定，那么我们就应该拥有它。
[00:27:03.000]  stability we kind of look for change. Whoa dude that's wild actually yeah it makes a lot of
[00:27:03.000] 我们追求稳定，但又渴望改变。哇，老兄，这太疯狂了，确实如此。
[00:27:09.880]  sense now that you put it that way. Yeah so I guess us searching for relationships and stuff it's
[00:27:09.880] 你这么一说，我好像明白了。是啊，所以我想我们都在寻找恋爱关系之类的东西。
[00:27:15.960]  not necessarily for that stability factor like we kind of have our thoughts rooted in like you said
[00:27:15.960] 不一定是为了那种稳定性因素，就像你说的，我们的想法往往根植于此。
[00:27:23.080]  fantasy or like wow this will be like some great love of my life and getting married is a big change
[00:27:23.080] 幻想，或者像“哇，这将是我生命中最伟大的爱情”，结婚是一件大事。
[00:27:31.080]  that kind of stuff versus like oh getting married is like stability in my life and that will
[00:27:31.080] 那种事和结婚能给我的生活带来稳定之类的事情截然不同。
[00:27:36.760]  anchor me down through all this like chaos and change that I'm experiencing. Dude actually it
[00:27:36.760] 让我在这混乱和变化中保持稳定。老兄，真的。
[00:27:43.400]  also ties up really well too because I think you mentioned that your parents got married before
[00:27:43.400] 这也很吻合，因为我记得你提到过你父母是先结婚的。
[00:27:48.440]  they immigrated and the like impending immigration was kind of like one of the factors and that's
[00:27:48.440] 他们移民了，诸如即将到来的移民潮之类的因素也是其中之一，这就是……
[00:27:54.040]  actually really similar for my parents as well where my dad knew that he had a really cool job
[00:27:54.040] 实际上，我父母的情况也很类似，我爸爸知道自己有一份很棒的工作。
[00:27:59.320]  opportunity where after a couple years he was going to be sent out to the US to kind of work at
[00:27:59.320] 机会是，几年后他将被派往美国工作。
[00:28:04.360]  the branches there. So then he was like okay I need to find the one that I can like do all of these
[00:28:04.360] 那里的那些分支。然后他就想，好吧，我需要找到一个可以做所有这些事情的分支。
[00:28:10.440]  things and go through all the trials and tribulations of life with and for someone like me it's kind
[00:28:10.440] 经历种种磨难，与人相伴一生，对我这样的人来说，这是一种慰藉。
[00:28:15.320]  of interesting because if I had to really choose I feel like my parents are the ones who are more
[00:28:15.320] 有趣的是，如果非要我选，我觉得我的父母才是更合适的人。
[00:28:21.160]  willing to take risks versus I'm the risk of our one where I'm like I don't even know if I want to
[00:28:21.160] 愿意承担风险，而我却成了我们这段关系的风险源，我甚至不知道自己是否想要这段关系。
[00:28:26.520]  move to a new city or move to a new state like that seems like too big for me.
[00:28:26.520] 搬到一个新的城市或者另一个州对我来说似乎太大了。
[00:28:31.720]  You know honestly I can kind of see that for you though because I think you have gone through
[00:28:31.720] 说实话，我能理解你的感受，因为我觉得你经历过很多。
[00:28:36.520]  a lot of change. You aren't the major immigrant I guess if that makes sense. For example like your
[00:28:36.520] 变化很大。我想你应该不是主要的移民群体吧。例如，就像你的
[00:28:45.640]  parents they moved away from your hometown essentially like when we were still pretty young.
[00:28:45.640] 父母在我们很小的时候就搬离了家乡。
[00:28:52.680]  So I think that was a big change and if anything I feel like your parents move around like a
[00:28:52.680] 所以我觉得这是一个很大的变化，而且我觉得你的父母就像……一样到处搬家
[00:28:57.000]  decent amount so that's kind of a lot of change in terms of maybe home-based kind of because
[00:28:57.000] 数额相当可观，所以从居家办公的角度来看，这算得上是很大的变化，因为
[00:29:03.880]  I think I still kind of view my parents' home as home-based at times.
[00:29:03.880] 我觉得我有时还是会把父母家当作自己的家。
[00:29:08.600]  I can see how that causes you to be like oh I need to find more stability and then end up
[00:29:08.600] 我能理解这会让你觉得“哦，我需要找到更稳定的生活”，然后最终……
[00:29:14.760]  participating in more like risk-averse actions. It's like my parents' immigration slash moving
[00:29:14.760] 参与更多类似规避风险的行为。就像我父母的移民/搬家经历一样。
[00:29:24.040]  around is affecting me like that's the change in my life. Yeah it's too much. Makes sense honestly.
[00:29:24.040] 周围的一切对我的影响就像是我生活中发生的变化一样。是啊，这太让人难以承受了。说实话，这很合理。
[00:29:29.720]  Yeah because I would say like in comparison to you I think I'm definitely a little more risk-taking
[00:29:29.720] 是的，因为我觉得和你相比，我肯定更爱冒险。
[00:29:37.320]  at least compared to my parents but I think overall as a person I still lean towards risk-averse
[00:29:37.320] 至少和我的父母相比是这样，但我认为总体而言，我个人仍然倾向于规避风险。
[00:29:43.960]  and I think maybe that's also just from us like growing up and seeing our parents being risk-averse
[00:29:43.960] 我觉得这或许也跟我们从小到大看到父母规避风险有关。
[00:29:49.960]  so then it's like okay then maybe that is like the right behavior or the like good behavior that
[00:29:49.960] 所以，那就好像，好吧，也许那才是正确的行为，或者说是良好的行为。
[00:29:56.600]  I should be modeling myself after. Right the more I think about it the more I wonder what other
[00:29:56.600] 我应该以他们为榜样。对，我越想越觉得，还有哪些人值得效仿呢？
[00:30:03.720]  aspects of life we can kind of attribute this to. So safer like finances for example right people
[00:30:03.720] 生活中的某些方面，我们可以将其归因于此。例如，更安全的财务状况，以及合适的人选。
[00:30:11.720]  in our generation tend to have a little bit of a different attitude about it than people in our
[00:30:11.720] 我们这一代人对此的态度往往与我们那一代人略有不同。
[00:30:15.800]  parents' generation. I don't know if your parents were huge into investing but I feel like
[00:30:15.800] 父母那一代。我不知道你的父母是否热衷于投资，但我感觉
[00:30:22.200]  our generation is like very much into that, very much into credit card churning. All of these things
[00:30:22.200] 我们这一代人似乎很喜欢这样，很喜欢信用卡套利。所有这些事情。
[00:30:27.400]  I feel like are very commonly discussed and talked about in people in our generation especially
[00:30:27.400] 我觉得这些话题在我们这一代人中非常常见，尤其如此。
[00:30:32.680]  things like opening a credit card or like what credit card is the best. Sometimes I find myself
[00:30:32.680] 比如如何开信用卡，或者哪张信用卡最好之类的事情。有时候我会发现自己
[00:30:37.160]  being the one to kind of explain things like that to my parents and I would say I'm far from an
[00:30:37.160] 我得负责向父母解释这类事情，而且我觉得我离“……”还差得远呢。
[00:30:41.560]  expert on those things. So do you think this like risk-averse kind of attitude can also apply
[00:30:41.560] 你是这方面的专家。那么你认为这种规避风险的态度也适用吗？
[00:30:48.200]  to the way we look at finances as well? Yes I think when you're talking about credit cards that
[00:30:48.200] 这也关系到我们看待财务的方式吗？是的，我认为当你在谈论信用卡时……
[00:30:53.720]  was totally something I could relate to. My parents they like never get credit cards with annual fees.
[00:30:53.720] 这一点我完全能感同身受。我父母从来不办有年费的信用卡。
[00:31:02.200]  So I have a couple that have annual fees and so sometimes when they hear about it they're like
[00:31:02.200] 所以我有几个客户需要缴纳年费，所以有时候他们听到这个消息时会说：
[00:31:08.280]  in all this shock. So like you know one of the most common ones is either chase Sapphire or like
[00:31:08.280] 在这一切震惊之中。所以你知道，最常见的情况之一就是追逐蓝宝石或者类似的事情
[00:31:14.600]  MX Platt and they have high annual fees. So I had Sapphire for a while and when my parents found out
[00:31:14.600] MX Platt 的年费很高。所以我用了一段时间的 Sapphire 卡，后来我父母发现后……
[00:31:22.680]  because they're like oh that card looks nice like what card is that? And I'm like oh it's the Sapphire
[00:31:22.680] 因为他们会说：“哦，这张卡看起来不错，这是什么卡？”然后我会说：“哦，这是蓝宝石卡。”
[00:31:26.760]  and I'm listing out all these benefits and then they're like oh does it have an annual fee? I'm like um
[00:31:26.760] 我列举了所有这些好处，然后他们就问，哦，它有年费吗？我当时就懵了。
[00:31:33.480]  yeah it's like $400 and they're like what the fuck? And I think in their eyes it's always like
[00:31:33.480] 对，大概400美元，他们都懵了，心想这他妈什么鬼？我觉得在他们眼里，这总是……
[00:31:42.360]  well we're trying not to spend money like the purpose of credit cards is not to spend more money but
[00:31:42.360] 我们尽量避免花钱，因为信用卡的目的不是为了花更多的钱。
[00:31:47.080]  to I don't know just have a way of spending money I guess. So I guess in their eyes it's like oh my
[00:31:47.080] 我也不知道，大概就是有花钱的方式吧。所以我想在他们眼里，这就像是……哦，我的天哪
[00:31:53.080]  god if I'm gonna pay like $400 on this credit card is it even worth it? They're not even thinking
[00:31:53.080] 天哪，如果我要用这张信用卡还400美元，这卡真的值得吗？他们根本就没考虑过这个问题。
[00:31:58.680]  about the perks I think and sometimes the perks don't even apply to them so I think that is a great
[00:31:58.680] 关于福利方面，我觉得有时候这些福利甚至不适用于他们，所以我认为这很棒。
[00:32:05.000]  example and it's not even necessarily risk versus not risk but it's definitely just like the way
[00:32:05.000] 举例来说，这甚至不一定是风险与非风险之争，而更像是某种方式。
[00:32:11.480]  that we manage like finances and view purchases. Yeah and I feel like they also have a completely
[00:32:11.480] 我们管理财务和查看购买记录。是的，我觉得他们也完全
[00:32:20.520]  different idea on what they consider like a waste of money slash a good investment because
[00:32:20.520] 他们对何为浪费金钱/何为好的投资有不同的看法，因为
[00:32:27.640]  okay this is honestly probably just a bad habit of mine personally but I eat out a lot
[00:32:27.640] 好吧，这大概是我个人的一个坏习惯，但我经常在外面吃饭。
[00:32:33.720]  so like busy days or whatever I'm in a bad mood I'm like okay we're gonna go out to eat or
[00:32:33.720] 所以，比如忙碌的日子或者心情不好的时候，我就会想，好吧，我们出去吃饭吧。
[00:32:38.680]  we'll like do it or something and I feel like that's like my toxic trait. But to me sometimes it's
[00:32:38.680] 我们会做这件事之类的，我觉得这算是我的一个缺点吧。但对我来说，有时候是这样。
[00:32:42.760]  worth it because the convenience makes up for the cost right but I feel like my parents never
[00:32:42.760] 值得，因为便利性弥补了成本，对吧？但我感觉我的父母从来没有
[00:32:49.240]  eat out they eat out significantly more when I'm there or they'll of course eat out for social
[00:32:49.240] 外出就餐：我在的时候，他们外出就餐的次数明显增多；当然，为了社交，他们也会外出就餐。
[00:32:55.000]  occasions but when it's just them too they always eat in and I guess I find that so fascinating
[00:32:55.000] 有时候会有例外，但即使只有他们两个人，他们也总是会在家吃，我觉得这很有意思。
[00:33:01.240]  where I'm like how can you just eat the same thing every day if my mom is a great chef
[00:33:01.240] 我当时就想，我妈厨艺那么好，怎么能每天都吃一样的东西呢？
[00:33:06.920]  but every day is like a little bit crazy to me. It is. Also I'm thinking like you know not everyone
[00:33:06.920] 但对我来说，每一天都有点疯狂。确实如此。而且我在想，你知道，并不是每个人都这样。
[00:33:13.320]  likes to cook and sometimes you just really need the break from cooking right in our eyes
[00:33:13.320] 喜欢烹饪，但有时候，在我们看来，你真的需要休息一下，不用做饭。
[00:33:19.160]  the money is worth the sanity essentially right exactly and then sometimes I'm like oh dude if
[00:33:19.160] 钱确实值理智，对吧？有时候我又会想，哎，如果
[00:33:25.080]  you don't want to cook then why don't we just go out and eat and then everyone will be happy
[00:33:25.080] 如果你不想做饭，那我们为什么不出去吃呢？这样大家都会很高兴。
[00:33:30.440]  but then I guess it's just rooted in their values and stuff that they're like oh fuck I'll just
[00:33:30.440] 但我想这可能根植于他们的价值观之类的东西，所以他们会想，哦，去他妈的，我就……
[00:33:35.080]  cook something simple you know we don't have to spend money. We're like okay like your sanity.
[00:33:35.080] 做点简单的菜，你知道我们不用花钱。我们就像在说，好吧，这样你就不会那么焦虑了。
[00:33:41.160]  Yeah and I feel like something really similar can be tied to like shopping habits as well
[00:33:41.160] 是的，我觉得类似的情况也可能与购物习惯有关。
[00:33:46.440]  where I guess to be fair when my parents spend or buy something that's really high quality like
[00:33:46.440] 我想公平地说，当我的父母花钱或购买真正高质量的东西时，比如
[00:33:51.960]  they will definitely invest the money in it but like on a daily basis I feel like my mom is like oh
[00:33:51.960] 他们肯定会把钱投资进去，但感觉我妈每天都会说“哦”。
[00:33:58.760]  for shoes like why would I get something from Nordstrom when I can just go to Nordstrom rack or
[00:33:58.760] 比如鞋子，我为什么要去 Nordstrom 买，我可以直接去 Nordstrom Rack 买啊？
[00:34:03.880]  Marshalls or TJ Maxx she's always hunting for that good deal yeah and I feel like I was very much
[00:34:03.880] 她总是在Marshalls或TJ Maxx寻找物美价廉的商品，是的，我觉得我当时也很……
[00:34:09.400]  so like raised and like steeped in that attitude but nowadays I'm kind of like okay I'm gonna go
[00:34:09.400] 所以，我从小就深受这种态度的影响，但现在我的想法是，好吧，我要走了。
[00:34:15.640]  for things that I really specifically want like specific models and stuff that I want instead of
[00:34:15.640] 对于我真正想要的东西，比如特定的型号和我想要的其他东西，而不是
[00:34:21.880]  just trying to find the best deal at TJ Maxx or the best deal at Marshalls I don't know like I feel
[00:34:21.880] 我只是想在TJ Maxx或者Marshalls找到最划算的商品，我不知道，感觉……
[00:34:27.640]  like my parents are they do well for themselves but yeah there's still like bargain hunting and
[00:34:27.640] 就像我父母一样，他们生活富裕，但还是会喜欢淘便宜货。
[00:34:32.440]  stuff which I'm always like fascinated by. Yeah I guess it's just their habit almost now it's
[00:34:32.440] 我一直对这些东西很感兴趣。是啊，我想这几乎已经成了他们的习惯了。
[00:34:39.320]  like so ingrained in them it's kind of funny my parents are definitely very similar and my dad will
[00:34:39.320] 就像这些特质深深地根植于他们的内心，这有点滑稽，我的父母也确实非常相似，我爸爸会
[00:34:45.000]  always go to similar stores that you mentioned and you know sometimes it's clothes that are maybe
[00:34:45.000] 我总是去你提到的那些类似的商店，你知道，有时候那里的衣服可能……
[00:34:50.760]  like a weird color or kind of like a hodgepodge of stuff at these stores right so my dad will just
[00:34:50.760] 就像这些商店里那些奇怪的颜色，或者各种东西乱七八糟的，对吧？所以我爸爸就……
[00:34:57.000]  buy these like super cheap bright crazy colored clothes I guess it kind of works out because most
[00:34:57.000] 买这些超级便宜的亮色疯狂衣服，我觉得还挺划算的，因为大多数
[00:35:04.840]  of them are like workout or like hiking clothes but I'm just sometimes I see my dad step out in
[00:35:04.840] 有些衣服就像运动服或登山服，但我有时看到我爸爸穿着它们出门。
[00:35:11.000]  these outfits of just like crazy vibrant colors and I'm like no you know like I'm not trying to
[00:35:11.000] 这些衣服颜色鲜艳得简直疯狂，我就想，不，你知道，我不是故意要穿成那样的。
[00:35:20.840]  be dressed like that because sometimes they'll sometimes they'll be like they'll send a photo
[00:35:20.840] 穿成那样是因为有时候他们会发照片
[00:35:26.040]  they're like oh I was shopping and I saw this like do you want it and it's like some bright like
[00:35:26.040] 他们会说：“哦，我逛街的时候看到了这个，问你想要吗？”它看起来有点亮闪闪的。
[00:35:30.360]  pink shit and I'm like thank you for thinking about me really but I don't think I want that you know
[00:35:30.360] 粉红色的玩意儿，我就想，谢谢你真的想着我，但我觉得我并不想要那个，你知道吗？
[00:35:39.000]  feel like I appreciate the gesture yeah I guess it's like we have the privilege of growing up in
[00:35:39.000] 我很感激这份心意，我想这就像我们有幸在这样的环境中长大一样。
[00:35:46.600]  this much more stable situation so we're able to be like oh yeah like I can be a little bit more
[00:35:46.600] 局势稳定得多，所以我们才能说，哦，是的，我可以更……
[00:35:53.880]  picky and schoozy with what I want to buy versus like this is a great deal I will focus on the
[00:35:53.880] 我对想买的东西很挑剔，而如果遇到很划算的交易，我就会重点关注。
[00:36:00.440]  great deals only not to say like I'm not gonna pass up a great deal right but like ultimately
[00:36:00.440] 优惠多多，当然不是说我绝对不会错过任何好机会，但最终还是得看情况。
[00:36:05.480]  it's kind of like oh I really want this so maybe I'll wait for this to go on sale versus like
[00:36:05.480] 感觉就像是“哦，我真的很想要这个，所以也许我会等它打折再买”，而不是像……
[00:36:10.840]  these are on sale I'll pick out of these yeah I think that's like the perfect way to put it actually
[00:36:10.840] 这些都在打折，我会从中挑选。嗯，我觉得这样说最贴切了。
[00:36:16.440]  and honestly now that I'm thinking about it I'm like damn maybe the way I had initially
[00:36:16.440] 说实话，现在想想，我感觉糟了，也许我最初的想法才是对的。
[00:36:21.160]  ordered it was a little bit giving spoiled fat because I feel like my parents do not hesitate
[00:36:21.160] 点的餐有点油腻，因为我觉得我父母毫不犹豫地给了我一些变质的脂肪。
[00:36:27.400]  to spend any expense on me but they will do the like bargain hunting for themselves so I'm like oh my
[00:36:27.400] 他们愿意为我花任何钱，但他们自己却会到处讨价还价，所以我就想，哦，我的天哪
[00:36:33.080]  on single tier like is this what happens when you're a parent where you're like I don't want the
[00:36:33.080] 单层结构，就像这样，当你为人父母时，你会想“我不想要……”
[00:36:37.720]  there's like this famous phrase and create that's like where once you're a parent you're like oh it's
[00:36:37.720] 有一句名言，意思是当你为人父母后，你会觉得“哦，这……”
[00:36:41.480]  okay child like you could have all my money I can survive off of $10 this week oh my god that is
[00:36:41.480] 好吧，孩子，就算你拿走我所有的钱，我这周也只靠10美元就能活下去，我的天哪！
[00:36:48.360]  probably definitely the vibe but maybe not when the kids growing up because the crazy growth spurts
[00:36:48.360] 氛围肯定没问题，但孩子们长大后可能就不一定了，因为他们会经历疯狂的生长发育期。
[00:36:55.080]  you're like no you're getting like the cheapest shit for now until you're done growing the truth
[00:36:55.080] 你会说，不，你现在只能先用最便宜的玩意儿，直到你真正了解真相为止。
[00:37:01.320]  do it the other day I was like cleaning out some old shit from my closet and since my parents
[00:37:01.320] 前几天我清理衣柜里一些旧东西的时候，因为我父母
[00:37:07.160]  moved a bunch like I felt like a lot of the like childhood relics I kind of was storing in the US
[00:37:07.160] 感觉好像把很多童年回忆都搬走了，这些东西我以前一直保存在美国。
[00:37:12.840]  so I was sifting through a bunch of them and one of them was this like really old north face jacket
[00:37:12.840] 我当时正在翻找一大堆衣服，其中一件是一件很旧的北面外套。
[00:37:17.960]  I had begged my parents to buy it for me when I was a freshman so that was 2010 or 2011 so this
[00:37:17.960] 我上大一的时候就央求父母给我买，大概是2010年或2011年吧。
[00:37:24.040]  jacket is already like almost a teenager right or it is a teenager actually I was like yeah I should
[00:37:24.040] 这件夹克看起来都快成青少年了，对吧？或者它本身就是个青少年？我当时就想，嗯，我应该……
[00:37:29.400]  probably donate this but I just couldn't let go of it because I was like I remember back in the day
[00:37:29.400] 我可能要捐出去，但我就是舍不得，因为我想起了以前的日子。
[00:37:34.120]  this was like it was expensive to spend like a hundred dollars on a jacket and I had like
[00:37:34.120] 这感觉就像花一百美元买件夹克很贵一样，而我当时却觉得……
[00:37:38.600]  begged my parents that I could wear this for a lifetime I just couldn't bring myself to toss it so
[00:37:38.600] 我苦苦哀求父母让我一辈子都穿这件衣服，我实在舍不得扔掉它。
[00:37:44.040]  I think I'm gonna keep it as like a memory item like I used to wear every single fucking day
[00:37:44.040] 我想我会把它留作纪念，就像我以前每天都戴着它一样。
[00:37:49.240]  in high school so it was like oh that's going back then I don't know it's just like things like
[00:37:49.240] 高中时，感觉就像“哦，那都是过去的事了”，我不知道，就是一些类似的事情。
[00:37:53.080]  that I feel like really stick with me yeah does it fit you still it's like slightly tight so I'm
[00:37:53.080] 我觉得它真的很适合我，对，它现在还合身吗？感觉有点紧，所以我……
[00:37:58.840]  gonna have to go on a couple diets but it'll hang well in the closet for until I'm there maybe your
[00:37:58.840] 我得节食几次，不过这件衣服在衣柜里能挂很久，直到我到了那里。也许你的
[00:38:05.400]  parents knew when they bought it that like it wasn't going to be a lifetime item but they were I'm
[00:38:05.400] 父母买的时候就知道这东西不会用一辈子，但他们还是买了。
[00:38:11.000]  sure they were very happy to see you wear it so much when you did get it though yeah that's true
[00:38:11.000] 当然，他们看到你经常戴着它，肯定很高兴，没错。
[00:38:16.840]  now it's an antique item yeah to think it's a teenager now dude I know that got me thinking just
[00:38:16.840] 现在它成了古董了，想想它以前是个青少年，老兄，我知道，这让我开始思考了。
[00:38:26.200]  about how I probably begged my parents to buy you know specific clothing items or like random
[00:38:26.200] 大概就是我小时候求我爸妈给我买某些特定的衣服或者其他一些乱七八糟的东西吧。
[00:38:33.320]  items and I think I definitely pulled that line too like I could use this for the rest of my life
[00:38:33.320] 物品，而且我觉得我肯定也说过类似的话，就像我可以一辈子都用不完这些东西一样。
[00:38:39.480]  and maybe in their mind it's like no she isn't going to but I guess she's very desperate for it
[00:38:39.480] 或许在他们看来，她肯定不会这么做，但我猜她其实非常渴望。
[00:38:45.880]  so I guess I'll cave this time damn that's true I mean I'm sure they've seen it all at that point yeah
[00:38:45.880] 所以我想我这次只能妥协了，该死，确实如此，我的意思是，我相信他们到那时什么都见怪不怪了。
[00:38:51.960]  I guess kind of along the lines of parenthood I think having a family and the concept of
[00:38:51.960] 我想这大概和为人父母有关，我认为拥有家庭以及家庭的概念……
[00:39:01.160]  family has also evolved across multiple generations so do you think the idea of a family
[00:39:01.160] 家庭也随着几代人的演变而发展，那么你认为家庭的概念是否仍然成立呢？
[00:39:07.160]  and the idea of parenthood has changed from our parents generation to ours um I feel like having kids
[00:39:07.160] 从我们父母那一代到我们这一代，为人父母的观念已经发生了变化。嗯，我感觉自己想要孩子。
[00:39:16.120]  is such a given in my parents generation and previous generations it's like such a it's not even
[00:39:16.120] 在我父母那一代以及更早的几代人中，这似乎是理所当然的，甚至可以说是理所当然的。
[00:39:24.280]  a question it's like this is just a part of life like you get married and have kids but I guess
[00:39:24.280] 这个问题感觉就像是生活的一部分，比如结婚生子，但我想……
[00:39:30.760]  like in our generation more and more people are starting to think about whether they even want
[00:39:30.760] 就像我们这一代人一样，越来越多的人开始思考他们是否真的想要……
[00:39:36.120]  to have kids right whether that's something you know they want in their lives but I feel like at
[00:39:36.120] 生孩子这件事本身就值得考虑，不管你是否知道他们想要孩子，但我感觉……
[00:39:41.720]  the same time some people experience pressure from their parents like oh can't wait till I have
[00:39:41.720] 与此同时，有些人会感受到来自父母的压力，比如“哦，我等不及要……”
[00:39:46.680]  that grand kid and then we're like um I don't know if I want to have kids yeah I feel like it's a very
[00:39:46.680] 有了孙子之后，我们就想，嗯，我不知道自己是否想要孩子，是的，我觉得这非常……
[00:39:53.640]  common conversation topic actually especially like for girl talks or talks with our girlfriends right
[00:39:53.640] 常见的聊天话题，尤其适合女生聊天或者和闺蜜聊天，对吧？
[00:39:59.080]  it's like I definitely think I've heard it a lot where people are like I'm not sure if I want to
[00:39:59.080] 我感觉我肯定听过很多人这么说，比如“我不确定我是否想要……”
[00:40:04.840]  have kids if I do it's like maybe one maximum two versus I know in our parents generation
[00:40:04.840] 如果我生孩子，最多也就一两个，不像我们父母那一代那样。
[00:40:11.800]  I feel like two was almost the standard back then yeah yeah I feel like there's a good amount of
[00:40:11.800] 我觉得那时候两个几乎是标准配置了，是啊，我觉得数量挺多的。
[00:40:16.920]  people who have at least one sibling and I also wonder maybe it's because when people immigrated
[00:40:16.920] 至少有一个兄弟姐妹的人，我也在想，这或许是因为人们移民的时候……
[00:40:23.240]  out of China because one kid policy was going on back then they're like hey we're in America we might
[00:40:23.240] 他们离开中国是因为当时中国实行独生子女政策，他们就想，嘿，我们现在在美国，我们或许可以。
[00:40:29.160]  as well have two children they're like well we moved all the way here yeah it's like the one child
[00:40:29.160] 他们还有两个孩子，他们会说，我们大老远搬到这里来，是啊，就像只有一个孩子一样。
[00:40:34.840]  policy is it's not out here so you know I mean I think even when it was my parents generation like both
[00:40:34.840] 政策是这里不这么做，所以你知道，我的意思是，我认为即使在我父母那一代，就像两者一样
[00:40:41.640]  of my parents have at least three siblings um my mom has four and I feel like for them having one
[00:40:41.640] 我父母至少有三个兄弟姐妹，我妈妈有四个，我觉得对他们来说，只有一个兄弟姐妹就够了。
[00:40:48.760]  kid or two was already pairing down the number significantly that's already like a huge reduction
[00:40:48.760] 生一两个孩子就已经大大减少了家庭规模，这已经是很大的缩减了。
[00:40:54.200]  but honestly when the standard is two or one you can only go down to zero or one from their true
[00:40:54.200] 但说实话，当标准是二或一时，你只能从它们的真实值降到零或一。
[00:41:02.920]  very very true the perception I have is that a lot of moms were relatively willing to just give up
[00:41:02.920] 确实如此，我的感觉是很多妈妈都比较愿意放弃。
[00:41:10.600]  their career and you know have a kid and take care of that kid because a lot of immigrant families
[00:41:10.600] 他们要兼顾事业，还要生孩子，照顾孩子，因为很多移民家庭都是这样。
[00:41:17.720]  aren't rich so it's pretty hard to get a nanny and so it was kind of the norm I guess or maybe
[00:41:17.720] 我们家并不富裕，所以很难请到保姆，所以这大概算是常态吧，或者也许吧。
[00:41:25.160]  very accepted slash natural for the man to become the breadwinner and then the woman becomes the
[00:41:25.160] 男人成为养家糊口的人，然后女人成为……这种观念被广泛接受，也被认为是自然而然的。
[00:41:32.840]  child care and nowadays like in our generation a lot more people want to have a career so I feel
[00:41:32.840] 育儿方面，现在像我们这一代人，越来越多的人想要拥有自己的事业，所以我感觉
[00:41:40.120]  like that is also maybe a difference because it's like oh shoot if I have a kid then you know that's
[00:41:40.120] 这或许也是一个区别，因为就像，哎呀，如果我有了孩子，你知道，那就是……
[00:41:45.160]  like almost a half a year of leave from my career and then I don't know like how that'll affect my
[00:41:45.160] 相当于将近半年的时间离开我的事业，然后我不知道这会对我的工作产生什么影响。
[00:41:53.000]  career path and all that kind of stuff so I feel like that's probably another factor yeah I think
[00:41:53.000] 职业发展道路之类的，我觉得这可能是另一个因素，是的，我想。
[00:41:59.160]  like there's probably a lot of stuff that goes into this attitude change for sure so like
[00:41:59.160] 这种态度转变肯定涉及很多因素，所以……
[00:42:04.840]  I wonder now in the US is it even possible to raise a kid comfortably like financially when
[00:42:04.840] 我现在想知道，在美国，是否有可能在经济上舒适地养育一个孩子。
[00:42:11.640]  you don't have a double income stream or something like I know back in the day things like homes
[00:42:11.640] 你没有双重收入来源，或者像我以前知道的那样，有房产之类的东西。
[00:42:16.600]  were significantly more affordable like still not cheap right but just not like the $1 million plus
[00:42:16.600] 价格实惠得多，当然还是不便宜，但远没有一百万美元以上那么贵。
[00:42:23.000]  colossal cost that it is now so then I feel like just the logistics have changed a ton and yeah
[00:42:23.000] 现在成本如此巨大，我觉得光物流就发生了翻天覆地的变化，是的。
[00:42:30.040]  I feel like in my parents' generation being a stay at home mom was super common but I'm not sure
[00:42:30.040] 我觉得在我父母那一代，全职妈妈很普遍，但我不太确定。
[00:42:34.120]  how common it is anymore and then on top of that you add in the whole like complication of immigration
[00:42:34.120] 这种情况现在有多普遍，再加上移民本身的种种复杂因素，就更让人头疼了。
[00:42:40.440]  where you know if I would have a kid now there's family here that could kind of help with the
[00:42:40.440] 你知道，如果我现在生孩子，这里有家人可以帮忙。
[00:42:45.320]  child rearing but for my parents unless my grandma was here visiting it was truly like them to
[00:42:45.320] 养育孩子方面，除非奶奶来探望，否则对我父母来说，这确实很符合他们的风格。
[00:42:51.720]  who had to take care of me or stay care which is another added expense so I can't imagine how it
[00:42:51.720] 谁来照顾我，或者留下来照顾我，这又是一笔额外的开支，所以我无法想象该怎么办。
[00:42:57.560]  was for them back then yeah really good point dude actually my brother who was born first um
[00:42:57.560] 对他们来说确实如此，嗯，说得对，兄弟。实际上，我哥哥是老大，嗯……
[00:43:05.240]  why'd you really eyes um no reason but when he was born I think both my parents were still in school
[00:43:05.240] 你为什么真的……嗯，没什么特别的原因，但是他出生的时候，我觉得我父母都还在上学。
[00:43:16.520]  so they were like oh it's gonna be like really difficult to raise him so they actually sent him
[00:43:16.520] 所以他们就觉得，哦，养他肯定很困难，所以就把他送走了。
[00:43:22.600]  back to China wow to live with my grandparents for I think it was about a year maybe two some
[00:43:22.600] 回到中国，哇，和祖父母一起生活了大概一年，也许两年吧。
[00:43:30.280]  amount of time between a year and two years and then I think my dad finished school so then they
[00:43:30.280] 大概过了一年到两年，然后我想我爸爸就毕业了，所以他们
[00:43:36.200]  brought my brother back because it was like okay now someone can work and we can actually support
[00:43:36.200] 我把弟弟接回来，因为这样一来，至少有人能工作了，我们也能真正养家了。
[00:43:40.520]  this child but yeah I guess like that's what my parents managed to do but I know like sometimes
[00:43:40.520] 这个孩子，嗯，我想这就是我父母做到的，但我知道有时候
[00:43:46.680]  people will straight up just immigrate their parents too like the you know the grandparents over
[00:43:46.680] 人们会直接把他们的父母也移民过来，比如祖父母辈的人。
[00:43:51.960]  to the US too and then they just live with the family and then some of these kids grow up like
[00:43:51.960] 他们也会去美国，然后和家人一起生活，有些孩子长大后就……
[00:43:57.800]  essentially getting raised by their grandparents because their parents had to go out and work to
[00:43:57.800] 他们基本上是由祖父母抚养长大的，因为他们的父母不得不外出工作。
[00:44:02.120]  support the family yeah I think that's probably pretty similar to what James says childhood was like
[00:44:02.120] 支持家庭，嗯，我觉得这可能和詹姆斯说的童年经历很相似。
[00:44:08.440]  where his grandma was definitely a huge factor in like helping raise him while his parents were
[00:44:08.440] 他的祖母在他成长过程中扮演了非常重要的角色，比如在他父母不在的时候帮助抚养他。
[00:44:13.160]  both working so yeah I feel like that's also another option as well but you're right like luckily
[00:44:13.160] 两者都可行，所以我觉得这也是个选择，但你说得对，幸运的是……
[00:44:20.040]  now that you know we're already immigrated here it's a little easier to be able to reach out to
[00:44:20.040] 既然您知道我们已经移民到这里，那么联系您就容易多了。
[00:44:28.520]  family and be like hey can you babysit this weekend or something like that right dude and I've
[00:44:28.520] 我会跟家人说，嘿，你这周末能帮忙照看一下孩子吗？或者类似的事情，对吧？我
[00:44:35.880]  been having some crazy thoughts lately like I saw that other day some vague tick talk about how
[00:44:35.880] 最近脑子里冒出了一些奇怪的想法，比如前几天我看到一些模糊的蜱虫在谈论……
[00:44:40.760]  equinox had some sort of daycare system were like some sort of play area for the kids while the
[00:44:40.760] Equinox 设有某种日托系统，就像一个儿童游乐区，而
[00:44:46.600]  parents worked out and I was like is this free daycare like should I just get it equinox membership
[00:44:46.600] 父母都锻炼了，我就问，这难道是免费的托儿所吗？我该不该办个 Equinox 会员？
[00:44:53.560]  like oh I see that's how they get you yeah even now getting a babysitter is not cheap especially if
[00:44:53.560] 哦，我明白了，原来他们是这么骗你的。是啊，即使现在请保姆也不便宜，尤其是如果……
[00:45:02.440]  they're working during the work days when the parents are at work I feel like if anything now
[00:45:02.440] 我觉得，如果说现在有什么变化的话，那就是他们在父母上班的日子里工作了。
[00:45:09.000]  businesses booming for these caretakers true also speaking of you know having kids and working jobs
[00:45:09.000] 确实，这些照护者的生意蒸蒸日上，而且说到这，你也知道，他们既要照顾孩子又要工作。
[00:45:15.800]  I feel like careers in itself is also another area where there's a difference generationally you know
[00:45:15.800] 我觉得职业生涯本身也是存在代际差异的另一个领域，你知道吗？
[00:45:22.840]  kind of time back to the idea of like willingness to take a risk slash change things up this is where
[00:45:22.840] 现在是时候回归到愿意承担风险/做出改变的理念了，这就是关键所在。
[00:45:29.720]  I see myself being a little more willing to take a risk because for my parents they're very
[00:45:29.720] 我觉得自己会更愿意承担风险，因为我的父母非常……
[00:45:38.040]  focused on stability so they're like you should become a software engineer because I know you'll
[00:45:38.040] 他们注重稳定性，所以他们会说你应该成为一名软件工程师，因为我知道你会……
[00:45:43.000]  be able to get a job there's a lot of those jobs in the Bay Area and it's a pretty well-paying
[00:45:43.000] 能够找到工作，湾区有很多这样的工作，而且薪水相当不错。
[00:45:49.000]  job as well so you know you'll be able to support yourself I was like no I'm gonna go major in
[00:45:49.000] 还要找份工作，这样你就能养活自己了。我当时就想，不，我要主修……
[00:45:53.960]  econ and they're like what does that even mean and I was like I don't know but I'll figure
[00:45:53.960] 他们问我经济学是什么意思，我说我也不知道，但我会搞清楚的。
[00:45:58.040]  out you know so I think definitely in that area and then also I've mentioned in the podcast before
[00:45:58.040] 你知道，所以我觉得肯定在这个领域，而且我之前在播客里也提到过。
[00:46:05.400]  where I had like a contractor job for a while so at first when I wanted to take that job my parents
[00:46:05.400] 我之前做过一段时间的承包商工作，所以一开始我想做那份工作的时候，我的父母
[00:46:10.840]  were like no like this is a contractor job you won't have like held insurance to the level of you
[00:46:10.840] 他们说，不，这是承包商的工作，你不会有保险，也不会承担你应承担的责任。
[00:46:16.840]  know full-time employees and you won't have the same benefits also there's a time limit you know
[00:46:16.840] 如果你认识全职员工，你就不会享有同样的福利，而且还有时间限制，你知道的。
[00:46:22.520]  you can be a contractor for a maximum of two years for this specific company and I was like no
[00:46:22.520] 你最多只能为这家公司做两年的承包商，我当时就想：不行。
[00:46:27.880]  I think it'll be okay like I think I want to take this risk because I could potentially get a
[00:46:27.880] 我觉得应该没问题，我觉得我想冒这个险，因为我有可能得到一个
[00:46:33.080]  full-time job after and they're like I don't know like this seems too risky like I don't understand
[00:46:33.080] 之后找份全职工作，他们却说：“我不知道，这看起来风险太大了，我不明白。”
[00:46:39.880]  but you know it ended up working out well but I could totally see that difference there they're
[00:46:39.880] 但你知道，最终结果还不错，但我完全能看出他们之间的区别。
[00:46:45.800]  just like no what is this please no but I was like I think it'll be okay yeah I feel like
[00:46:45.800] 就好像，不，这是什么？求求你不要！但我又想，我觉得应该没事的，嗯，我感觉……
[00:46:52.280]  also parents are very into jobs where you can lock in and stay for like 10 plus years like I
[00:46:52.280] 而且，家长们也很喜欢那种可以稳定工作十年以上的职业，就像我一样。
[00:46:59.480]  feel like that generation really values like long-term stability sort of in the bay at least I know
[00:46:59.480] 感觉那一代人真的很看重长期的稳定，至少在湾区是这样，我知道的。
[00:47:05.960]  for a while people were saying oh the best way to increase your salary is to job hop every one
[00:47:05.960] 有一段时间，人们都在说，提高工资的最好方法就是频繁跳槽。
[00:47:10.360]  to two years and I said that at the dinner table once my parents pretty early on in my career
[00:47:10.360] 两年后，我在父母家的餐桌上说过这句话，那也是我职业生涯早期的事了。
[00:47:17.160]  and I was like yeah people nowadays have been saying you stay for a maximum of two years because
[00:47:17.160] 我当时就想，是啊，现在人们都说最多待两年，因为
[00:47:21.560]  otherwise you get pigeoned hold into the salary that you were hired at and they were like but how
[00:47:21.560] 否则你就会被困在当初入职时的薪水里，他们会问：可是，这怎么可能？
[00:47:27.400]  are you gonna learn and grow and I was like well I think when people hop jobs you kind of get
[00:47:27.400] 你会学习和成长吗？我当时想，嗯，我觉得人们跳槽的时候，你总会得到一些启发。
[00:47:33.400]  like a promotion and they were like I don't think that makes any sense like how would you learn
[00:47:33.400] 就像升职一样，他们却说我觉得这完全没道理，你怎么能学会呢？
[00:47:37.240]  anything and I was like I'm like I don't know that's what all the young people are saying
[00:47:37.240] 什么都行，我就想，我不知道，这就是所有年轻人都在说的话。
[00:47:42.040]  and I feel like that's truly like the difference where back then like your company and your work
[00:47:42.040] 我觉得这才是真正的区别，就像以前你的公司和你的工作一样。
[00:47:49.000]  was a lot more serious and I'm not saying that I don't find my work serious but I think our generation
[00:47:49.000] 以前要严肃得多，我并不是说我不觉得我的工作严肃，但我认为我们这一代人的工作更严肃。
[00:47:55.480]  has kind of sensed or like realized that companies aren't like your friend right like HR isn't
[00:47:55.480] 他似乎已经意识到，公司不像你的朋友，对吧？比如人力资源部门就不是。
[00:48:02.600]  your friend companies are prioritizing like shareholders above the employees a lot of the times
[00:48:02.600] 你朋友所在的公司很多时候都把股东利益置于员工利益之上。
[00:48:10.440]  so then I don't think it's like personally offensive for employees to prioritize themselves
[00:48:10.440] 所以我觉得员工优先考虑自身利益并不算是人身攻击。
[00:48:15.560]  over the company but I think that's just totally different attitudes from our parents
[00:48:15.560] 虽然公司上下都支持这项业务，但我认为这与我们父母的态度截然不同。
[00:48:20.760]  all about that loyalty and stability
[00:48:20.760] 一切都关乎忠诚和稳定。
[00:48:24.440]  but yeah I feel like it's just so interesting once I learned about this concept of you know
[00:48:24.440] 但是，是的，我觉得一旦我了解了这个概念，它就变得非常有趣了。
[00:48:32.280]  people experiencing change look for stability and people experiencing stability look for change
[00:48:32.280] 经历变化的人寻求稳定，而身处稳定中的人寻求变化。
[00:48:37.160]  and I feel like super applicable for that generational gap between us and our parents and super
[00:48:37.160] 我觉得这非常适用于我们和父母之间的代沟，而且非常
[00:48:44.680]  relatable for just you know people who are going through different things and so after learning
[00:48:44.680] 能引起那些经历不同事情的人的共鸣，所以在学习之后
[00:48:50.120]  about that concept I was mind blown and I really felt like I gained better perspective
