[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]：大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:14.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are nearing the end of summer but we can't end summer without discussing
[00:00:14.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得夏天快要结束了，但如果不讨论……，夏天就不算结束。
[00:00:22.290] [SPEAKER_00]: brat summer. So I'm sure a lot of people have maybe heard this word getting tossed around lately,
[00:00:22.290] [SPEAKER_00]：熊孩子夏天。我相信最近很多人都听到过这个词，
[00:00:30.470] [SPEAKER_00]: especially on social media and I feel like it kind of epitomizes current slang and where it's at.
[00:00:30.470] [SPEAKER_00]：尤其是在社交媒体上，我觉得它很好地体现了当前的俚语及其流行趋势。
[00:00:38.070] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about brat. The origin of it is Charlie XCX's album, literally named Brett
[00:00:38.070] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我们来聊聊“brat”这个词。它的起源是Charlie XCX的专辑，专辑名就叫《Brett》。
[00:00:44.790] [SPEAKER_00]: and it's so iconic because it's just brat and the most basic font all lower case on a like lime green background.
[00:00:44.790] [SPEAKER_00]：它之所以如此经典，是因为它就像是brat，字体非常简单，全部小写，背景是浅绿色。
[00:00:53.330] [SPEAKER_01]: And that album cover is so recognizable because my commute to San Francisco,
[00:00:53.330] [SPEAKER_01]：那张专辑封面之所以如此容易辨认，是因为我每天通勤去旧金山，
[00:00:59.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I would always drive by this one wall and it would have Brett in that lime green,
[00:00:59.390] [SPEAKER_01]：我每次开车经过这面墙时，都会看到布雷特用那种亮绿色的颜料画着。
[00:01:04.670] [SPEAKER_01]: the lower case text on the wall. I guess like some sort of marketing for the album or something.
[00:01:04.670] [SPEAKER_01]：墙上的小写文字。我猜可能是某种专辑宣传之类的。
[00:01:09.330] [SPEAKER_01]: But the moment I saw it, I could not stop thinking about it and something like the color was just so
[00:01:09.330] [SPEAKER_01]：但我第一眼看到它的时候，就一直想着它，它的颜色简直太……
[00:01:14.990] [SPEAKER_01]: fresh. I was like yeah, Brett, like I love this. I don't know what it is but I'm in.
[00:01:14.990] [SPEAKER_01]：新鲜感。我当时就想，对啊，布雷特，我喜欢这种感觉。我不知道它是什么，但我就是喜欢。
[00:01:20.990] [SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also such a statement. You're like, what is Brett? Right. This is this mean.
[00:01:20.990] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这句话也很有意思。你会想，布雷特到底是什么人？没错。这很刻薄。
[00:01:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's actually part of the huge fun and debate of this word that has turned from
[00:01:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]：我认为这实际上正是这个词的巨大乐趣和争论所在，它已经从
[00:01:33.130] [SPEAKER_00]: a simple album music album into a whole almost want to call it like a cultural movement.
[00:01:33.130] [SPEAKER_00]：一张简单的专辑音乐专辑，几乎可以称之为一场文化运动。
[00:01:41.590] [SPEAKER_00]: It's just been like taking over things and I think it's really funny because people
[00:01:41.590] [SPEAKER_00]：这就像接管一切一样，我觉得这真的很有趣，因为人们
[00:01:45.370] [SPEAKER_00]: definitely debate if things are brat or not. And also it fundamentally changed the word to.
[00:01:45.370] [SPEAKER_00]：这绝对值得讨论，到底是不是小屁孩的行为。而且它也从根本上改变了这个词的含义。
[00:01:51.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Brett is an adjective instead of like, bratty. It's like it's brat.
[00:01:51.670] [SPEAKER_00]：Brett 是一个形容词，而不是像 bratty 那样的意思。它就像是 brat。
[00:01:57.690] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've liked the concept of Brett is so funny too because like you said,
[00:01:57.690] [SPEAKER_01]：我也很喜欢布雷特这个角色，他真的很有趣，就像你说的，
[00:02:02.170] [SPEAKER_01]: it's something that people I guess are continually defining. So if you look up articles about
[00:02:02.170] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得这是人们一直在不断定义的东西。所以如果你去查阅关于……的文章。
[00:02:07.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Brett summer instead of clearly defining what brat means, it'll be like,
[00:02:07.870] [SPEAKER_01]：布雷特·萨默没有明确定义“brat”是什么意思，而是说，
[00:02:12.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Brett is a strappy white tank top with no bra. Oh my god. Brett is smoking cigarettes by the beach.
[00:02:12.050] [SPEAKER_01]：布雷特穿着一件白色吊带背心，里面没穿胸罩。我的天哪。布雷特在海滩边抽烟。
[00:02:19.110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's really just vibes only. No real definition of it. Although if I were to really like try to
[00:02:19.110] [SPEAKER_01]：这真的只是一种感觉，没有确切的定义。虽然如果我真的想尝试……
[00:02:25.770] [SPEAKER_00]: put it into words, I think some words that come to mind are like bold doing whatever you want,
[00:02:25.770] [SPEAKER_00]：用语言来形容，我想到的一些词是：大胆地做任何你想做的事。
[00:02:31.770] [SPEAKER_01]: not giving a fuck kind of attitude. Yeah and I think it also evokes kind of a grungy party aesthetic
[00:02:31.770] [SPEAKER_01]：一种毫不在乎的态度。是啊，我觉得它也营造出一种颓废派对的氛围。
[00:02:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: a little bit. So one of the things that I saw when doing some brat research was someone labeled
[00:02:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]：有点儿。我在做一些关于“小屁孩”的研究时发现，有人被贴上了……的标签
[00:02:44.810] [SPEAKER_01]: Brett summer as the opposite movement to the clean girl aesthetic. And I was like, yeah that makes sense.
[00:02:44.810] [SPEAKER_01]：Brett Summer 代表了与“清纯女孩”美学截然相反的潮流。我当时就想，嗯，这很有道理。
[00:02:50.910] [SPEAKER_01]: That does make sense. Smudgy, gel eyeliner vibes instead of like perfect, slick back bun vibes.
[00:02:50.910] [SPEAKER_01]：确实有道理。比起完美无瑕、一丝不苟的丸子头，更喜欢晕染的眼线妆容。
[00:02:57.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Like you were doing something. You can tell you you had fun and were like engaging in
[00:02:57.110] [SPEAKER_00]：对。就像你在做某件事一样。你可以说你玩得很开心，而且很投入。
[00:03:03.390] [SPEAKER_01]: activity. Right. Well I do have a question for you on the topic of Brett. Do you think you
[00:03:03.390] [SPEAKER_01]：活动。好的。关于布雷特，我有个问题想问你。你认为你
[00:03:10.070] [SPEAKER_00]: have been having a brat summer this year? Oh, actually I saw a meme that I think is relatable.
[00:03:10.070] [SPEAKER_00]：你今年夏天过得很叛逆吗？哦，其实我看到一个表情包，我觉得挺有共鸣的。
[00:03:17.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Brat summer except I'm staying inside in a sleep by nine. That's kind of me except
[00:03:17.450] [SPEAKER_00]：除了我九点就睡懒觉，其他时间都宅在家里，这夏天真是个熊孩子。我这样挺好的，除了……
[00:03:24.370] [SPEAKER_00]: minus the sleep by nine part, but just brat summer except I'm staying inside. I don't know if my
[00:03:24.370] [SPEAKER_00]：去掉九点钟睡觉那部分，就是暑假里那种不羁的风格，只不过我待在室内。我不知道我的
[00:03:32.110] [SPEAKER_01]: but my attitude towards life has been totally brat. Okay, then that counts. You've been having a brat
[00:03:32.110] [SPEAKER_01]：但我对待生活的态度一直都很任性。好吧，那这算数。你一直都很任性。
[00:03:38.730] [SPEAKER_00]: summer. True. Although I will say maybe your lie has been brat. August has been more calm,
[00:03:38.730] [SPEAKER_00]：夏天。没错。不过我得说，也许你撒谎了，小屁孩。八月比较平静，
[00:03:44.490] [SPEAKER_01]: but your lie was definitely brat. You know that's a good point actually. July was very brat.
[00:03:44.490] [SPEAKER_01]：但你撒谎的方式确实很任性。你说得对，七月确实很任性。
[00:03:51.450] [SPEAKER_00]: But August is demure. August were like gathering ourselves to get back into the swing of things
[00:03:51.450] [SPEAKER_00]：但八月是沉稳的。八月就像是我们重新振作起来，回到正轨的过程。
[00:03:58.870] [SPEAKER_00]: for September. Not that we're in school or anything, but it just feels like the start of
[00:03:58.870] [SPEAKER_00]：九月。倒不是说我们已经开学什么的，只是感觉像是……的开始。
[00:04:03.670] [SPEAKER_01]: something new. Totally feel that although it does make me a little bit sad because brat
[00:04:03.670] [SPEAKER_01]：一些新的东西。完全能感受到，虽然这让我有点难过，因为小屁孩
[00:04:08.830] [SPEAKER_01]: summer is such a iconic concept that I'm like worried. I'm like is brat summer only destined for
[00:04:08.830] [SPEAKER_01]：夏天这个概念太经典了，我都有点担心了。我在想，是不是只有叛逆的夏天才会如此？
[00:04:16.190] [SPEAKER_01]: summer of 2024. Are we fucked for next summer? Not to be remembered. I wonder if we'll just
[00:04:16.190] [SPEAKER_01]：2024 年夏天。我们明年夏天是不是完蛋了？不值得被记住。我想知道我们是不是……
[00:04:23.250] [SPEAKER_00]: evolve it to like, you know, brat fall, brat winter, brat year, the bratism. Because also I think
[00:04:23.250] [SPEAKER_00]：把它演变成，你知道的，像“小屁孩秋季”、“小屁孩冬季”、“小屁孩年”，也就是“小屁孩主义”。因为我觉得……
[00:04:29.890] [SPEAKER_00]: people don't necessarily add, you know, the and modifier to it. Sometimes they're just like,
[00:04:29.890] [SPEAKER_00]：人们不一定会在后面加上“and”修饰语。有时候他们就只是这样，
[00:04:35.390] [SPEAKER_00]: oh that's brat. And I think some of the funny and simple ones are like if anything is
[00:04:35.390] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，那是小屁孩。我觉得有些有趣又简单的笑话就像“如果有什么事是……”
[00:04:40.750] [SPEAKER_00]: limed green or any sort of like bright green people will be like, oh that's brat. I saw funny
[00:04:40.750] [SPEAKER_00]：如果是亮绿色或者其他任何类似的颜色，人们会觉得，哦，那真是个小屁孩。我看到过搞笑的例子。
[00:04:47.170] [SPEAKER_00]: one that was like the picture of one of the New York subways, the G-line which is notoriously
[00:04:47.170] [SPEAKER_00]：一张就像纽约地铁G线的照片，这条地铁线臭名昭著。
[00:04:53.710] [SPEAKER_00]: unreliable and it's also one of the green colored lines. The tweet was like this diva right here.
[00:04:53.710] [SPEAKER_00]：不可靠，而且它还是绿色的一条线。这条推文就像这位耍大牌的明星一样。
[00:04:59.770] [SPEAKER_00]: She's truly having a brat summer not working taking time off to vibe until Labor Day.
[00:04:59.770] [SPEAKER_00]：她这个夏天真是过得无比放纵，没工作，一直休假到劳动节。
[00:05:05.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, brat isn't attitude. Actually it's a lifestyle. Yeah, so hopefully it's with us for good.
[00:05:05.710] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，小屁孩不是一种态度，实际上是一种生活方式。是啊，所以希望这种生活方式能一直伴随着我们。
[00:05:11.790] [SPEAKER_00]: Should we be getting like some lime green t-shirts to wear? With brat on it or no brat. What's
[00:05:11.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我们是不是应该买些亮绿色的T恤穿？带“brat”图案的也行，不带也行。这是什么意思？
[00:05:19.110] [SPEAKER_00]: brat year? Without brat because then it's a if you know, you know, such a way. Oh, true. It's like
[00:05:19.110] [SPEAKER_00]：是“小屁孩年”吗？没有“小屁孩”这个词，因为那样就变成“如果你懂，你懂的，就是这样”。哦，对。就像
[00:05:25.690] [SPEAKER_01]: real brats would understand. So actually our topic today gives me a little bit of brat energy
[00:05:25.690] [SPEAKER_01]：真正的熊孩子会明白的。所以，我们今天的话题其实让我有点熊孩子气。
[00:05:33.610] [SPEAKER_01]: because we wanted to talk a bit about dealing with people you dislike. I guess this makes it sound
[00:05:33.610] [SPEAKER_01]：因为我们想稍微谈谈如何应对你不喜欢的人。我想这样说听起来……
[00:05:41.970] [SPEAKER_01]: super negative, but it doesn't always have to be someone you like hate, but maybe it's just someone that
[00:05:41.970] [SPEAKER_01]：非常消极，但不一定非得是你喜欢或讨厌的人，也许只是某个人……
[00:05:48.930] [SPEAKER_01]: you have had negative experiences within the past and you have to continually see or something like
[00:05:48.930] [SPEAKER_01]：你过去有过一些不愉快的经历，你必须不断地看到或类似的事情
[00:05:54.410] [SPEAKER_01]: that. So we really just wanted to sit down and chat through our techniques, our warning signs
[00:05:54.410] [SPEAKER_01]：就是这样。所以我们真的只是想坐下来好好聊聊我们的技巧和预警信号。
[00:06:00.630] [SPEAKER_01]: and any sort of reversals that we've seen in the past as well. So I guess the first question here
[00:06:00.630] [SPEAKER_01]：以及我们过去看到的任何类型的逆转。所以我想这里的第一个问题是……
[00:06:05.510] [SPEAKER_00]: is like, how does this like maybe start for you? Where does it usually root from?
[00:06:05.510] [SPEAKER_00]：这就像，对你来说，这种事情是怎么开始的？它通常是从哪里开始的？
[00:06:11.090] [SPEAKER_01]: I think for the most part when you meet people in an interact with them,
[00:06:11.090] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为大多数情况下，当你遇到并与人互动时，
[00:06:16.550] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of people tend to stay in the midsection where it's not really like you like them,
[00:06:16.550] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得很多人往往处于一种不上不下的状态，你既不喜欢他们，也不真的喜欢他们。
[00:06:23.990] [SPEAKER_01]: but you also don't dislike them. You're just neutral. At the end of the day, even if you have
[00:06:23.990] [SPEAKER_01]：但你也不讨厌他们。你只是保持中立。归根结底，即使你……
[00:06:29.270] [SPEAKER_01]: a couple of conversations with someone, you might not really know them. So I feel most people
[00:06:29.270] [SPEAKER_01]：和某人聊过几次之后，你可能并不真正了解他。所以我感觉大多数人
[00:06:34.110] [SPEAKER_01]: stay in that neutral slash in a offensive range. But I definitely have had my fair share of
[00:06:34.110] [SPEAKER_01]：保持进攻范围内的中立斩击姿势。但我肯定也经历过不少这样的情况。
[00:06:42.050] [SPEAKER_01]: people that I dislike and it's kind of hard to categorize because I think some of them there is
[00:06:42.050] [SPEAKER_01]：我讨厌的人，很难归类，因为我觉得其中一些人……
[00:06:47.690] [SPEAKER_01]: like something. Maybe there's an event that happens, there's something that I catch that I find is
[00:06:47.690] [SPEAKER_01]：就像某种东西。也许是发生了什么事，我捕捉到了什么，我发现是
[00:06:53.250] [SPEAKER_01]: slightly weird or off putting about them but sometimes it's like honestly just kind of based on
[00:06:53.250] [SPEAKER_01]：它们有点奇怪或者让人反感，但有时候，说实话，这只是基于……
[00:06:59.250] [SPEAKER_01]: vibes which sounds a little horrible, but it's almost like an instinctive like yeah we're like
[00:06:59.250] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉，听起来有点糟糕，但几乎是一种本能，就像，是的，我们就像
[00:07:05.170] [SPEAKER_01]: super different and not in a way that is positive. Right because so it's not necessarily like
[00:07:05.170] [SPEAKER_01]：截然不同，而且不是往好的方向发展。对，因为这并不一定像……
[00:07:11.990] [SPEAKER_00]: a dislike but it's just like oh this isn't something I'm used to. So you have like a weird
[00:07:11.990] [SPEAKER_00]：有点不喜欢，但感觉就像“哦，这跟我以前习惯的不一样”。所以你有一种奇怪的感觉。
[00:07:17.970] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling about it maybe that's just not necessarily positive. Yeah I'm like maybe the
[00:07:17.970] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉可能并不一定是积极的。是啊，我感觉可能是……
[00:07:23.550] [SPEAKER_01]: better way of thinking about it is instead of oh I dislike you it's kind of like if I had to categorize
[00:07:23.550] [SPEAKER_01]：更好的思考方式是，与其说“哦，我不喜欢你”，不如说“如果我必须给你归类”。
[00:07:29.650] [SPEAKER_01]: between yes and no I would probably put you in no. Mm yes I think I understand like you
[00:07:29.650] [SPEAKER_01]：在“是”和“否”之间，我大概会选“否”。嗯，是的，我想我明白你的意思了。
[00:07:34.810] [SPEAKER_00]: probably wouldn't have hung out with this person if not for mutual friends. Mm I think I'm
[00:07:34.810] [SPEAKER_00]：如果不是因为共同的朋友，我可能不会和这个人来往。嗯，我想我是
[00:07:40.110] [SPEAKER_00]: probably similar to you maybe if someone is kind of rude or like makes me feel uncomfortable then
[00:07:40.110] [SPEAKER_00]：可能跟你差不多，如果有人有点粗鲁或者让我感到不舒服，那我也会这样。
[00:07:47.190] [SPEAKER_00]: I would also kind of like fall into that oh I like I want to stay away from this person you know.
[00:07:47.190] [SPEAKER_00]: 我也有点想陷入那种状态，哦，我想远离这个人，你知道吗。
[00:07:53.570] [SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's also sometimes just like an unfair position where like let's say I'm just in a
[00:07:53.570] [SPEAKER_00]：但我认为有时候也存在一种不公平的处境，比如说，我处于……
[00:07:58.890] [SPEAKER_00]: terrible mood and I just hate everyone. If you are in that unfortunate situation and have caught
[00:07:58.890] [SPEAKER_00]：心情糟透了，我讨厌所有人。如果你不幸也遇到了这种情况，并且感染了……
[00:08:04.710] [SPEAKER_00]: me in a terrible mood then like I'm sorry I might just like instinctually dislike everyone around
[00:08:04.710] [SPEAKER_00]：我心情很糟糕的时候，可能会本能地讨厌周围的所有人，对不起。
[00:08:11.050] [SPEAKER_00]: me and that impression just stays in my brain for a certain reason. No honestly you bring up a
[00:08:11.050] [SPEAKER_00]：我和那个印象不知为何一直萦绕在我的脑海里。说真的，你提起这件事……
[00:08:17.290] [SPEAKER_01]: good point because dislike isn't always justified and another example that I can think of kind of
[00:08:17.290] [SPEAKER_01]：说得对，因为不喜欢并不总是合理的，我能想到的另一个例子是……
[00:08:28.870] [SPEAKER_01]: people right and say one group of people are being super loud and obnoxious and you're kind of
[00:08:28.870] [SPEAKER_01]：人们说得对，有一群人特别吵闹、特别讨厌，而你却有点……
[00:08:34.730] [SPEAKER_01]: in your quiet era so then you might be like oh that group of people they're not my vibe. When
[00:08:34.730] [SPEAKER_01]：在你安静的时期，你可能会想，哦，那群人，他们跟我不太合拍。
[00:08:40.290] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe on an individual level like you would totally get along but because of the circumstances
[00:08:40.290] [SPEAKER_01]：也许就个人而言，你们会相处得很好，但由于种种原因……
[00:08:45.590] [SPEAKER_00]: they're like temporarily slotted as disliked. Mm so true this can even happen with good friend
[00:08:45.590] [SPEAKER_00]：他们就像暂时被归类为不喜欢的人。嗯，确实如此，这种情况甚至会发生在好朋友身上。
[00:08:51.210] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe you know we're hanging out and half of the people are just like super super energetic and
[00:08:51.210] [SPEAKER_00]：也许你知道，我们正在聚会，其中一半人都超级超级有活力，
[00:08:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]: being really loud in that moment you're like you're one of my best friends but like I dislike you right
[00:08:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]：当时你声音特别大，感觉你就像是我最好的朋友之一，但我又好像不喜欢你，对吧？
[00:09:02.590] [SPEAKER_01]: now. That's very true which I guess just goes to show it's not always like super personal sometimes
[00:09:02.590] [SPEAKER_01]：现在。确实如此，我想这正好说明，有时候事情并不总是那么私人化。
[00:09:09.470] [SPEAKER_01]: it is just like case by case situation yeah but I do want to ask when you have these feelings of
[00:09:09.470] [SPEAKER_01]：这就像具体情况具体分析一样，但我确实想问一下，当你产生这种感觉的时候……
[00:09:17.170] [SPEAKER_01]: dislike do you think it's obvious to the people around you that you might potentially dislike someone
[00:09:17.170] [SPEAKER_01]：你觉得你周围的人能明显看出你可能不喜欢某人吗？
[00:09:26.430] [SPEAKER_00]: um I feel like if you know me yes and maybe you can confirm or deny this but I feel like it's
[00:09:26.430] [SPEAKER_00]: 嗯，我觉得如果你了解我，或许你可以证实或否认这一点，但我感觉是这样的
[00:09:36.570] [SPEAKER_00]: not too difficult to tell with me I'll probably just be more quiet or reserved around you.
[00:09:36.570] [SPEAKER_00]：不难判断，我可能只会和你在一起时更安静或更矜持一些。
[00:09:43.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I've definitely seen that I'm like love out like internally love because I think there's two
[00:09:43.710] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，我确实感觉到了，我既有外在的爱，也有内在的爱，因为我觉得爱是双重的。
[00:09:54.650] [SPEAKER_01]: they will know and you will like let them know and the other type is like I'm just going to crawl
[00:09:54.650] [SPEAKER_01]：他们会知道的，你也会让他们知道，另一种情况就像我只能爬过去。
[00:09:59.590] [SPEAKER_01]: back into my shell until like I am removed from this situation or something. I can't decide sometimes
[00:09:59.590] [SPEAKER_01]：我又把自己封闭起来，直到我脱离这种境地为止。有时候我真的无法做决定。
[00:10:06.190] [SPEAKER_00]: because it's like on a certain level treating everyone with you know respect and kindness is
[00:10:06.190] [SPEAKER_00]：因为在某种程度上，尊重和善待每个人就是……
[00:10:13.710] [SPEAKER_00]: nice I think but you know maybe if you dislike someone if you treat them like that are people like
[00:10:13.710] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得挺好的，但是你知道，如果你不喜欢某人，你那样对待他们，那他们就是那种人。
[00:10:19.530] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god you're so fake because you were so nice to me and then you turn around and like should
[00:10:19.530] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，你太虚伪了，你之前对我那么好，然后你转过身来就……
[00:10:23.630] [SPEAKER_00]: talk to your friends or something right but then I'm like I don't know I wouldn't want to like
[00:10:23.630] [SPEAKER_00]：跟朋友聊聊什么的，对吧？但后来我就想，我不知道，我不想那样。
[00:10:28.730] [SPEAKER_00]: treat you poorly either just because like maybe you rub me the wrong way because of a certain thing.
[00:10:28.730] [SPEAKER_00]：要么是因为你某些行为惹恼了我，要么就是我对你很不好。
[00:10:34.510] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point I guess there's like a fine line where you can be polite and tactful without
[00:10:34.510] [SPEAKER_01]：你说得对，我觉得礼貌和得体之间确实存在一条微妙的界限，既可以保持礼貌和得体，又不必过分亲昵。
[00:10:41.550] [SPEAKER_01]: necessarily like showering them with compliments or something like that but I feel like when you're
[00:10:41.550] [SPEAKER_01]：不一定非要用赞美之词来讨好他们，但我觉得当你……
[00:10:45.650] [SPEAKER_01]: actually in that social situation it can be sort of hard to gauge but at the end of the day
[00:10:45.650] [SPEAKER_01]：实际上，在那种社交场合中，很难准确判断，但归根结底……
[00:10:50.970] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe the best solution is always to kind of slowly fade away into the background and you know
[00:10:50.970] [SPEAKER_01]：也许最好的办法就是慢慢地融入背景，你知道的。
[00:10:56.570] [SPEAKER_00]: have like a short polite but short conversation yeah yeah I think I tend to try to keep our interaction
[00:10:56.570] [SPEAKER_00]：进行简短礼貌但简短的对话，嗯嗯，我想我倾向于尽量减少我们的互动。
[00:11:04.390] [SPEAKER_00]: pretty short but you know I don't want it to be a negative interaction so I try to keep it pretty like
[00:11:04.390] [SPEAKER_00]：虽然很短，但你知道我不想让互动变成负面的，所以我尽量让它保持友好。
[00:11:10.610] [SPEAKER_00]: neutral to positive but yeah it's difficult because sometimes you know at the end of the day
[00:11:10.610] [SPEAKER_00]：中性偏正面，但确实很难说，因为有时候你知道，归根结底……
[00:11:16.250] [SPEAKER_00]: you vent to your friends you're like oh actually like you know this person robs me the wrong way
[00:11:16.250] [SPEAKER_00]：你跟朋友倾诉，你会说，哦，其实你知道吗，这个人抢劫的方式不对。
[00:11:20.730] [SPEAKER_00]: but like whatever I mean in high school years that would obviously very easily become blown out
[00:11:20.730] [SPEAKER_00]：但不管我的意思，在高中时期，那显然很容易被吹散。
[00:11:27.070] [SPEAKER_00]: of proportion right though oh my god this person thinks oh a bitch or whatever right but I think
[00:11:27.070] [SPEAKER_00]：比例对吧，我的天哪，这个人觉得……哦，真是个婊子什么的，对吧，但我认为
[00:11:31.970] [SPEAKER_01]: it's just like it's natural you can't like everyone totally I'm trying to think if it's obvious
[00:11:31.970] [SPEAKER_01]：这很正常，你不可能完全喜欢所有人。我在想这是否显而易见。
[00:11:37.790] [SPEAKER_01]: when I dislike someone I think they're probably times where it is really obvious but I've been working
[00:11:37.790] [SPEAKER_01]：当我讨厌某人时，我觉得有些时候可能表现得非常明显，但我一直在努力……
[00:11:45.090] [SPEAKER_01]: on trying to hide it a little bit better yeah so I think in more recent years my skills on
[00:11:45.090] [SPEAKER_01]：关于试图更好地隐藏它，是的，所以我觉得近年来我的技巧……
[00:11:51.690] [SPEAKER_00]: hiding it happen improving I think you're pretty good at hiding it for the most part oh really
[00:11:51.690] [SPEAKER_00]：隐藏它正在发生，而且有所改善。我觉得你大部分时候都很擅长隐藏它。哦，真的吗？
[00:11:56.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I think like with your game face-on for like a social event you can definitely match everyone's vibes
[00:11:56.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得，如果你在社交场合中展现出你的游戏风格，你肯定能与每个人的情绪完美契合。
[00:12:04.010] [SPEAKER_00]: happy vibes wait okay that makes me very happy actually it's working to be fair I think if there's
[00:12:04.010] [SPEAKER_00]：气氛很愉快，等等，好吧，这让我非常高兴，实际上它确实有效，公平地说，我认为如果有的话……
[00:12:12.490] [SPEAKER_00]: people who we don't vibe with as much we're not you know voluntarily trying to put them in an
[00:12:12.490] [SPEAKER_00]：我们和那些不太合得来的人，我们并不是故意要把他们拉进一个圈子。
[00:12:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable situation to like hang out with us yeah so there's also that that's true it's
[00:12:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]：和我们一起出去玩确实有点尴尬，没错，确实如此。
[00:12:23.610] [SPEAKER_01]: definitely getting rare and rare to like have these interactions with people we might potentially
[00:12:23.610] [SPEAKER_01]：和我们可能认识的人进行这种互动，确实越来越少了。
[00:12:28.010] [SPEAKER_01]: dislike because it's so curated now it's like you see who you want to see okay what if you
[00:12:28.010] [SPEAKER_01]：不喜欢，因为现在内容太精心策划了，感觉你只能看到你想看到的人，好吧，如果你
[00:12:33.850] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe don't love someone but they like really like you
[00:12:33.850] [SPEAKER_00]：也许你不爱某个人，但他们真的很喜欢你。
[00:12:40.590] [SPEAKER_01]: has that ever happened do maybe back in school this was like a little bit more common
[00:12:40.590] [SPEAKER_01]：这种情况以前发生过吗？也许在学校的时候比较常见。
[00:12:46.450] [SPEAKER_01]: but it's definitely a hard situation to navigate I feel like it adds to the guilt a little bit more
[00:12:46.450] [SPEAKER_01]：但这确实是一个很难应对的情况，我觉得这会加重我的内疚感。
[00:12:53.110] [SPEAKER_01]: instead of just being like oh I would prefer not to see someone it's like I would prefer not to see
[00:12:53.110] [SPEAKER_01]：与其说“哦，我不想见到某人”，不如说“我不想见到……”
[00:12:57.750] [SPEAKER_01]: them and on top of that I have all these shitty feelings like storming around it's like my friend
[00:12:57.750] [SPEAKER_01]：他们，而且除此之外，我还有一堆糟糕的感觉，就像我的朋友一样，情绪像风暴一样来回蔓延。
[00:13:04.370] [SPEAKER_00]: I think this did kind of happen to me but it's a little like different but um I was on this
[00:13:04.370] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这事儿确实发生在我身上了，不过有点不一样，嗯，我当时就……
[00:13:12.390] [SPEAKER_00]: like group trip and there was this person who honestly I would say we like we were friends like we
[00:13:12.390] [SPEAKER_00]：就像一次团体旅行，里面有个人，老实说，我觉得我们就像朋友一样。
[00:13:17.010] [SPEAKER_00]: got along well together but there was like a moment of annoyance so I guess like in that moment
[00:13:17.010] [SPEAKER_00]：我们相处得很好，但中间有那么一瞬间有点小摩擦，所以我想就是在那一瞬间
[00:13:24.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I disliked them for a bit and it's such a stupid thing too it was like later on the trip
[00:13:24.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我一开始有点讨厌他们，而且这事儿也挺蠢的，就像后来在旅途中发生的那样。
[00:13:31.070] [SPEAKER_00]: we were all on the bus going from like destination A to B and I was sitting next to my friend
[00:13:31.070] [SPEAKER_00]：我们当时都在一辆从A地到B地的巴士上，我坐在我朋友旁边。
[00:13:37.370] [SPEAKER_00]: and then I guess like they fell asleep and then they like fell onto my shoulder
[00:13:37.370] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我猜他们就睡着了，然后就倒在了我的肩膀上。
[00:13:43.530] [SPEAKER_00]: dude I don't know I was like an angsty teen or whatever but also I think it was like a surprise
[00:13:43.530] [SPEAKER_00]：兄弟，我也不知道，我当时可能像个叛逆的青少年什么的，但我觉得这也算是个意外吧。
[00:13:48.770] [SPEAKER_00]: in the moment I was like oh my personal space has just been invaded without any like prior
[00:13:48.770] [SPEAKER_00]：当时我就想，我的个人空间就这样被侵犯了，事先没有任何征兆。
[00:13:55.510] [SPEAKER_00]: acknowledgement but also it's like I can't do anything about it because they're just sleeping
[00:13:55.510] [SPEAKER_00]：我表示理解，但感觉我也无能为力，因为他们只是在睡觉。
[00:14:00.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to like wake them up and be like don't fucking sleep on my shoulder
[00:14:00.790] [SPEAKER_00]：我不想吵醒他们，然后说“别他妈睡在我肩膀上”。
[00:14:08.050] [SPEAKER_00]: honestly there's like no harm or anything but I think it's like the the surprise
[00:14:08.050] [SPEAKER_00]：说实话，这没什么害处什么的，但我认为这就像是一种惊喜。
[00:14:13.130] [SPEAKER_00]: traveling being a you know new place jet lag tired all of that added up and in that moment
[00:14:13.130] [SPEAKER_00]：旅行，你知道，去一个陌生的地方，时差，疲惫，所有这些加起来，在那一刻……
[00:14:19.930] [SPEAKER_00]: I was annoyed and I actually thought about it a lot after that happened like sometimes I still
[00:14:19.930] [SPEAKER_00]：我当时很生气，而且在那件事发生之后，我真的反复思考过很多次，有时候我仍然会想起这件事。
[00:14:24.930] [SPEAKER_01]: think about it I'm like what was that so annoyed? I think so much of what we consider dislike
[00:14:24.930] [SPEAKER_01]：想想看，我就在想，到底是什么事让我这么生气？我觉得我们通常认为的“不喜欢”其实很多都源于……
[00:14:34.130] [SPEAKER_01]: or like annoyance is unexplainable you know it's like so many factors combined into like one
[00:14:34.130] [SPEAKER_01]：或者说，恼怒是无法解释的，你知道吗？就像很多因素混合在一起，最终变成了一种感觉。
[00:14:41.810] [SPEAKER_01]: flash of like a rage or something but I feel like I've also had moments where I'm like
[00:14:41.810] [SPEAKER_01]：就像突然爆发了一阵怒火之类的，但我感觉我也曾有过这样的时刻：
[00:14:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]: suddenly I don't like hang out with this person dude it's like completely irrational and I'm like okay
[00:14:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]：突然间我就不想跟这个人待在一起了，这完全没道理，我就想，好吧
[00:14:52.370] [SPEAKER_01]: no it's shitty but I still feel it you know I guess maybe part of this could be your social
[00:14:52.370] [SPEAKER_01]：不，这很糟糕，但我仍然有这种感觉，你知道吗？我想这可能部分原因在于你的社交
[00:14:58.550] [SPEAKER_00]: battery is truly drained and you haven't recognized it yet and then this flash of annoyance or
[00:14:58.550] [SPEAKER_00]：电池真的没电了，你还没意识到，然后突然闪过一丝恼怒。
[00:15:04.350] [SPEAKER_00]: anger is like one of the signs because on that trip I think I was in high school you know I might not
[00:15:04.350] [SPEAKER_00]：愤怒就像是征兆之一，因为在那次旅行中，我想我当时还在上高中，你知道，我可能不会
[00:15:10.690] [SPEAKER_00]: have been as like self-aware and then also we were all just a bunch of you know like teenage kids
[00:15:10.690] [SPEAKER_00]：我们一直都很有自知之明，而且我们当时都只是一群你知道的十几岁的孩子。
[00:15:17.910] [SPEAKER_00]: this trip was like one or two weeks long and we all had to like share rooms as well for our room
[00:15:17.910] [SPEAKER_00]：这次旅行大概持续了一到两周，我们都得合住一个房间。
[00:15:25.550] [SPEAKER_00]: and bored and I'm definitely an introvert you know I know now that I really appreciate it when I
[00:15:25.550] [SPEAKER_00]：而且很无聊，我绝对是个内向的人，你知道吗？我现在明白了，我真的很感激……
[00:15:31.310] [SPEAKER_00]: have time to recharge that social battery so just thinking back on that trip I'm like yeah it's
[00:15:31.310] [SPEAKER_00]：有时间给社交充电，所以回想起那次旅行，我就觉得，是啊，就是这样。
[00:15:35.910] [SPEAKER_00]: super fun but I was probably like dying at the end like where can I just sit by myself to like recover
[00:15:35.910] [SPEAKER_00]：超级好玩，但最后我可能都累死了，就想着去哪儿找个地方一个人坐下来缓一缓。
[00:15:41.910] [SPEAKER_00]: every single waking moment otherwise I was like with people yeah that's really tough and I
[00:15:41.910] [SPEAKER_00]：除此之外，我醒着的每一刻都像在和别人相处一样，是啊，这真的很难，而且我
[00:15:47.750] [SPEAKER_01]: think like especially when we're young hormones are raging there's like all this academic pressure
[00:15:47.750] [SPEAKER_01]：想想看，尤其是在我们年轻的时候，荷尔蒙分泌旺盛，还要承受各种学业压力。
[00:15:52.730] [SPEAKER_01]: on your shoulders or just you know like the whole future is in front of you and you're like at such
[00:15:52.730] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉肩上扛着重担，或者你知道，就像整个未来都在你面前，而你却……
[00:15:57.910] [SPEAKER_01]: an inflection point in your life now beginning these social situations is not as easy because like
[00:15:57.910] [SPEAKER_01]：你现在正处于人生的一个转折点，开始应对这些社交场合并不像以前那么容易，因为……
[00:16:04.450] [SPEAKER_01]: you said now that we're older like we know our preferences and to a certain extent we also know our
[00:16:04.450] [SPEAKER_01]：你说现在我们年纪大了，我们知道自己的喜好，而且在某种程度上，我们也知道我们的
[00:16:09.390] [SPEAKER_01]: limits like I know I can't hang out with someone too many consecutive days in a row otherwise
[00:16:09.390] [SPEAKER_01]：比如我知道我不能连续好几天和某人待在一起，否则就会有限制。
[00:16:15.710] [SPEAKER_01]: I'll start going crazy so then back then I feel like we didn't really know that so then
[00:16:15.710] [SPEAKER_01]：我会开始发疯，所以我觉得那时候我们其实并不知道这一点。
[00:16:21.470] [SPEAKER_01]: I remember like some revocations and stuff every single day we would hang out and then I would be like
[00:16:21.470] [SPEAKER_01]：我记得好像每天都会发生一些撤销之类的事情，我们每天都会出去玩，然后我就会说
[00:16:26.950] [SPEAKER_01]: why am I starting to feel like annoyed all the time instead of thinking oh maybe this is like too much
[00:16:26.950] [SPEAKER_01]：为什么我总是感到烦躁，而不是想着“哦，也许这有点过头了”？
[00:16:32.290] [SPEAKER_00]: hanging out yeah for sure but do you think like in terms of these you know whether it's a flash of like
[00:16:32.290] [SPEAKER_00]：出去玩当然可以，但你觉得就这些而言，你知道，这是否只是一闪而过的念头？
[00:16:39.850] [SPEAKER_00]: annoyance or dislike in the moment or maybe like a poor first impression have you ever been
[00:16:39.850] [SPEAKER_00]：你是否曾经有过这样的经历：当下感到恼火或厌恶，或者像糟糕的第一印象？
[00:16:44.810] [SPEAKER_00]: able to like overlook that or like turn it around and then turn this situation into actually a very
[00:16:44.810] [SPEAKER_00]：能够忽略这一点，或者扭转局面，把这种情况变成一个非常
[00:16:51.910] [SPEAKER_01]: positive friendship honestly yeah I can definitely think of maybe like a few key people
[00:16:51.910] [SPEAKER_01]：说实话，积极的友谊，我确实能想到几个关键人物。
[00:16:58.970] [SPEAKER_01]: where maybe my first impression or like first interaction with them was not super positive and then
[00:16:58.970] [SPEAKER_01]：也许我对他们的第一印象或者说第一次接触并不是非常积极，然后
[00:17:04.590] [SPEAKER_01]: I left that interaction being like oh that was weird like hopefully I don't have to talk to this
[00:17:04.590] [SPEAKER_01]：我离开的时候感觉很奇怪，心想希望以后不用再跟这个人说话了。
[00:17:09.910] [SPEAKER_01]: person again but after conversation to conversation three I was like wait this person is awesome
[00:17:09.910] [SPEAKER_01]：又是这个人，不过聊到第三次对话的时候，我就觉得这个人太棒了。
[00:17:16.110] [SPEAKER_01]: and you know maybe in that moment where I was first talking to them I could have been looking for
[00:17:16.110] [SPEAKER_01]：你知道吗，也许在我第一次和他们交谈的那一刻，我可能是在寻找……
[00:17:22.070] [SPEAKER_01]: something specific like you know how sometimes you're in that era where you're like I want to
[00:17:22.070] [SPEAKER_01]：具体来说，你知道，有时候你会处于那种阶段，你会想“我想……”
[00:17:27.030] [SPEAKER_01]: have deep talks or like sometimes you're like I don't want to have deep talks like I just want
[00:17:27.030] [SPEAKER_01]：有时候会进行深入的谈话，或者有时候你会想，我不想进行深入的谈话，我只想……
[00:17:30.310] [SPEAKER_01]: to have fun right now like you know depending on what you want in that moment I feel like that's kind
[00:17:30.310] [SPEAKER_01]：现在就尽情享受吧，你知道，这取决于你那一刻想要什么，我觉得这挺好的。
[00:17:34.570] [SPEAKER_01]: of like the great book that you use to evaluate your interaction with someone so then over time when
[00:17:34.570] [SPEAKER_01]：就像你用来评估你与某人互动情况的那本伟大的书一样，随着时间的推移，当
[00:17:41.090] [SPEAKER_01]: the sample size croaks maybe it kind of like evens out a little right like you start to see them
[00:17:41.090] [SPEAKER_01]：样本量有点不足，也许会稍微趋于平衡，就像你开始看到它们一样。
[00:17:46.390] [SPEAKER_00]: as a whole person versus just that one like instance of them yeah also the other thing too is I
[00:17:46.390] [SPEAKER_00]：作为一个完整的人，而不是仅仅指他们身上的某个特定特质，是的，还有一点是……
[00:17:53.350] [SPEAKER_01]: feel like for most people myself completely included there's like specific environments where they're
[00:17:53.350] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得对大多数人来说，包括我自己，在某些特定环境下，他们会……
[00:17:58.770] [SPEAKER_01]: most fun or like they're the most themselves I realize I don't love lunch dates but if we grab
[00:17:58.770] [SPEAKER_01]：最有趣或者最能展现真我的场合。我意识到我不喜欢午餐约会，但如果我们抓紧时间，那感觉肯定很棒。
[00:18:06.510] [SPEAKER_01]: coffee or like grab a drink or something I feel like that's something that I prefer a little bit more
[00:18:06.510] [SPEAKER_01]：咖啡或者喝点什么的，我觉得我更喜欢这个。
[00:18:11.590] [SPEAKER_00]: wow good to know I think we've had a lunch date before well it wasn't just us too oh my god that was
[00:18:11.590] [SPEAKER_00]：哇，太好了，我想我们之前一起吃过午饭，嗯，当时不只有我们两个人，哦我的天哪，那真是……
[00:18:19.730] [SPEAKER_01]: fine that was one no just like some lunches I just can't do it like oh a lunch no lunch dates
[00:18:19.730] [SPEAKER_01]：好吧，那次不行，就像有些午餐我就是做不到，比如，哦，午餐，不，午餐约会
[00:18:28.750] [SPEAKER_00]: would be soon me crossing out every potential like I'm just gonna cancel these yeah but I think that's
[00:18:28.750] [SPEAKER_00]：我很快就会把所有可能性都划掉，就像我要取消这些一样，是的，但我认为就是这样。
[00:18:39.090] [SPEAKER_00]: totally fair for example I'm not a morning person so if someone was like crystal let's grab like
[00:18:39.090] [SPEAKER_00]：完全公平，例如，我不是个早起的人，所以如果有人说“水晶，我们去拿吧”，
[00:18:44.070] [SPEAKER_00]: early breakfast I would probably be like I would literally rather die like you're like I can't think
[00:18:44.070] [SPEAKER_00]：早起吃早餐的话，我可能会说，我宁愿去死，就像你一样，我根本想不起来。
[00:18:51.490] [SPEAKER_00]: anything I want to do less yeah like you're telling me I need a wake up at six a.m. to eat food
[00:18:51.490] [SPEAKER_00]：任何我想少做的事情，比如你告诉我我需要早上六点起床吃饭。
[00:18:57.430] [SPEAKER_01]: when I could just sleep and eat later oh my god so you know like if someone were to first meet me
[00:18:57.430] [SPEAKER_01]：如果我能睡到自然醒，晚点再吃东西，我的天哪，你知道，就像如果有人第一次见到我……
[00:19:05.390] [SPEAKER_01]: at lunch or first meet you at breakfast they might be like these girls are whack yeah yeah this is
[00:19:05.390] [SPEAKER_01]：午餐时或者早餐初次见面时，她们可能会说：“这些女孩真够糟糕的，是啊是啊，这……”
[00:19:12.090] [SPEAKER_00]: why it's like the only time I can do a morning meal with people a social morning meal
[00:19:12.090] [SPEAKER_00]：为什么这好像是我唯一能和大家一起吃早餐的时间，一起吃顿社交早餐。
[00:19:17.610] [SPEAKER_00]: is if it's brunch and usually alcohol is involved then I'm tolerable but that's it yeah that's
[00:19:17.610] [SPEAKER_00]：如果是早午餐，而且通常有酒，那我还能忍受，但也仅此而已。
[00:19:24.930] [SPEAKER_00]: the earliest you can go when my boyfriend and I first started dating I told him I was like I'm not
[00:19:24.930] [SPEAKER_00]：最早你能去的时候，我和我男朋友刚开始交往的时候，我告诉他，我说我不是。
[00:19:30.570] [SPEAKER_00]: really a morning person I definitely don't wake up early I guess the first time he witnessed it he was
[00:19:30.570] [SPEAKER_00]：我其实是个早起的人，我绝对不会早起。我猜他第一次看到这一幕的时候……
[00:19:36.070] [SPEAKER_00]: like oh you really aren't a morning person he's like you're super grumpy in the morning just I was like yeah
[00:19:36.070] [SPEAKER_00]：就像，哦，你真的不是个早起的人，他说你早上特别暴躁，我就说，是啊。
[00:19:44.510] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm not my best self and it is kind of funny though because you know there's been social situations
[00:19:44.510] [SPEAKER_01]：我状态不太好，不过想想也挺搞笑的，因为你知道，最近发生了一些社交事件。
[00:19:51.510] [SPEAKER_01]: where I've showed up and on the way home I'm like that wasn't like the best impression of me
[00:19:51.510] [SPEAKER_01]：我到那儿之后，在回家的路上我就想，那可不是给我留下的最好印象。
[00:19:57.870] [SPEAKER_01]: because I'm tired because I just had this stressful thing and blah blah like there's always reasons why
[00:19:57.870] [SPEAKER_01]：因为我累了，因为我刚刚经历了一件压力很大的事情，等等等等，总是有各种各样的理由。
[00:20:03.530] [SPEAKER_01]: you are a certain way at any sort of event I think true but it's not like other people know that
[00:20:03.530] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得你在任何场合的表现都差不多，但其他人并不知道这一点。
[00:20:09.130] [SPEAKER_01]: so I guess the learning here is maybe when I judge people on like oh this person was being so
[00:20:09.130] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我想，我在这里学到的可能是，当我评判别人时，比如“哦，这个人真是太……”
[00:20:13.770] [SPEAKER_01]: extra this person was being so why there's all these personal reasons that they might have had
[00:20:13.770] [SPEAKER_01]：这个人之所以如此，是因为他有很多个人原因，可能是……
[00:20:18.310] [SPEAKER_00]: but I would have like no clue about yeah that's a really good point like not every day is going
[00:20:18.310] [SPEAKER_00]：但我完全不知道，是的，你说得很有道理，并不是每天都是这样。
[00:20:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]: to be everyone's best day of their life right and I think we've talked about this a really long time
[00:20:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]：要让这一天成为每个人一生中最美好的一天，对吧？我想我们已经讨论这个问题很久了。
[00:20:28.490] [SPEAKER_00]: ago on the podcast but first impressions are truly like not indicative of what a person is like
[00:20:28.490] [SPEAKER_00]：之前在播客里说过，但第一印象真的不能反映一个人的真实面貌。
[00:20:35.350] [SPEAKER_00]: so you know if you meet a person one time and you hit it off that's amazing but if you don't
[00:20:35.350] [SPEAKER_00]：所以你知道，如果你和某人只见过一次面，而且你们一见如故，那真是太棒了，但如果你没见过面，那就太可惜了。
[00:20:40.310] [SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't necessarily mean that that's who they are all the time yeah one of the things that I've
[00:20:40.310] [SPEAKER_00]：但这并不一定意味着他们一直都是那样的人，是的，我……
[00:20:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]: been trying to be a little bit more conscious of now in my late 20s is I really sometimes when
[00:20:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]：我现在快30岁了，一直在努力让自己更有意识一些，有时候我真的……
[00:20:53.890] [SPEAKER_01]: I dislike someone it's also like me just projecting my insecurities on to them for example
[00:20:53.890] [SPEAKER_01]：我讨厌某人，就像是我把自己的不安全感投射到他们身上一样，例如
[00:20:59.890] [SPEAKER_01]: I can be fairly awkward sometimes and like anxious it's not a quality that I like love about myself
[00:20:59.890] [SPEAKER_01]：我有时候会比较笨拙，而且容易焦虑，这不是我喜欢自己的一个特质。
[00:21:07.710] [SPEAKER_01]: and it's definitely something that when it comes up I'm like oh god like here we go again
[00:21:07.710] [SPEAKER_01]：而且每次提到这件事，我都会想，哦，天哪，又要来了。
[00:21:12.010] [SPEAKER_01]: so sometimes when I see someone and I can like sniff out similarities between us especially
[00:21:12.010] [SPEAKER_01]：所以有时候当我看到某人时，我能嗅出我们之间的相似之处，尤其是
[00:21:19.650] [SPEAKER_01]: similarities of qualities that I dislike about myself I think I sometimes interpret that as oh I
[00:21:19.650] [SPEAKER_01]：我讨厌自己身上的某些特质，我觉得我有时会把这些特质解读为“哦，我
[00:21:26.350] [SPEAKER_01]: don't really vibe with this person when that's not really fair it's all like I don't vibe
[00:21:26.350] [SPEAKER_01]：我跟这个人不太合得来，但这其实不太公平，感觉就是我们之间没有共鸣。
[00:21:31.830] [SPEAKER_01]: with this person it's more like I don't vibe with myself and this person is like collateral damage
[00:21:31.830] [SPEAKER_01]：跟这个人相处，感觉更像是我跟自己合不来，这个人就像是附带的伤害。
[00:21:38.450] [SPEAKER_01]: from why negative feelings about myself they're catching strays yeah so when I was younger
[00:21:38.450] [SPEAKER_01]：从为什么我对自己的负面情绪开始，它们就像流浪动物一样，是的，所以当我年轻的时候
[00:21:44.990] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I really realize this but now that I'm older I'm like okay that's like kind of shitty
[00:21:44.990] [SPEAKER_01]：我以前可能没意识到这一点，但现在年纪大了，我觉得这其实挺糟糕的。
[00:21:50.670] [SPEAKER_01]: so if I'm able to recognize it I try to kind of stray away from these negative feelings or like
[00:21:50.670] [SPEAKER_01]：所以如果我能意识到这一点，我会尽量避免陷入这些负面情绪，或者……
[00:21:56.730] [SPEAKER_01]: at least talk myself out of it like oh you're just projecting your own insecurities like it's
[00:21:56.730] [SPEAKER_01]：至少我会说服自己别这样，比如“哦，你只是把自己的不安全感投射到别人身上而已”。
[00:22:00.850] [SPEAKER_00]: this person's fall that's such a good point I think I can completely relate it's like this
[00:22:00.850] [SPEAKER_00]：这个人摔倒了，说得太对了，我完全能感同身受，就像这样。
[00:22:06.950] [SPEAKER_00]: person is just too real like you're facing everything that you don't like about yourself you're
[00:22:06.950] [SPEAKER_00]：这个人太真实了，就像你面对着自己所有不喜欢的地方一样。
[00:22:11.690] [SPEAKER_00]: like how could I possibly like this person right but in the moment you just don't realize
[00:22:11.690] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我怎么可能喜欢上这个人呢？但当时你就是意识不到。
[00:22:16.790] [SPEAKER_00]: that's what's happening that amir is actually just put in front of you but I think another aspect
[00:22:16.790] [SPEAKER_00]：这就是现在的情况，阿米尔实际上就站在你面前，但我认为还有另一个方面。
[00:22:23.570] [SPEAKER_00]: of that is maybe in the moment you're feeling insecure because of I don't know anxiety or
[00:22:23.570] [SPEAKER_00]：也许是因为你此刻感到不安全，比如焦虑或其他什么原因。
[00:22:31.490] [SPEAKER_00]: you had a bad day and then you project that onto the people that you met it's like oh because this
[00:22:31.490] [SPEAKER_00]：你今天过得很糟糕，然后你就把这种糟糕的情绪投射到你遇到的人身上，就好像，哦，因为这个
[00:22:37.390] [SPEAKER_00]: was a bad day everyone else is colored in like a more negative light when you know if it was a good
[00:22:37.390] [SPEAKER_00]：如果今天过得很糟糕，其他人都会被赋予负面色彩，但你知道如果今天过得不错的话。
[00:22:42.750] [SPEAKER_01]: day like you would have loved everyone true and I feel like this can also extend to on feelings
[00:22:42.750] [SPEAKER_01]：就像你今天会爱所有人一样，真的，我觉得这也可以延伸到感受上。
[00:22:49.090] [SPEAKER_01]: that you have about other people this is a little bit immature but it's like you know when you go
[00:22:49.090] [SPEAKER_01]：你对其他人的看法，这有点不成熟，但就像你知道当你……
[00:22:54.550] [SPEAKER_01]: to meet your friends friends and you might only know your friend who invited you but your friend
[00:22:54.550] [SPEAKER_01]：去见你朋友的朋友，你可能只认识邀请你的那个朋友，但你的朋友
[00:23:00.450] [SPEAKER_01]: knows like this entire group of people who have their own inside jokes and whatever with your
[00:23:00.450] [SPEAKER_01]：认识这群人，他们之间有自己的内部笑话和各种梗，还有你
[00:23:05.350] [SPEAKER_01]: friend like I feel like in moments like that I like have to actively talk myself out of okay like
[00:23:05.350] [SPEAKER_01]：朋友，我觉得在那种时刻，我必须主动说服自己冷静下来，好吗？
[00:23:11.750] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay that this person has other friends you know like you don't have to be insecure about it
[00:23:11.750] [SPEAKER_01]：这个人有其他朋友没关系，你知道的，你没必要为此感到不安。
[00:23:17.530] [SPEAKER_01]: like you don't have to be jealous and at the very least don't let this jealousy turn until dislike or
[00:23:17.530] [SPEAKER_01]：你没必要嫉妒，至少不要让这种嫉妒演变成厌恶或反感。
[00:23:23.650] [SPEAKER_01]: something and I feel like this sounds very high school but you know all the honest like I still
[00:23:23.650] [SPEAKER_01]：有些话，我觉得这听起来很像高中生说的话，但你知道，所有坦诚的话，就像我仍然
[00:23:29.230] [SPEAKER_01]: feel feelings like this well into my 20s instead of like denying these feelings I guess the
[00:23:29.230] [SPEAKER_01]：我二十多岁的时候仍然会有这种感觉，而不是否认这些感觉，我想……
[00:23:35.430] [SPEAKER_01]: solution is more to just knock it off as soon as you search a sense of it to like face it
[00:23:35.430] [SPEAKER_01]：解决办法更像是一旦你意识到这一点，就立刻停止，就像面对现实一样。
[00:23:41.660] [SPEAKER_00]: and like deal with it yeah exactly but then you're like oh this is so difficult
[00:23:41.660] [SPEAKER_00]：然后就像是接受了它，对，没错，但之后你又会觉得，哦，这太难了。
[00:23:49.240] [SPEAKER_01]: I know it really is hard I think the easy thing to do is just be like yeah I fucking hate
[00:23:49.240] [SPEAKER_01]：我知道这真的很难，我觉得最简单的做法就是直接说“是啊，我他妈讨厌”。
[00:23:53.820] [SPEAKER_00]: everyone here I mean that's like I feel like that's bra damn that is bra
[00:23:53.820] [SPEAKER_00]：各位，我的意思是，我觉得这就像胸罩，该死的，这简直就是胸罩
[00:24:04.000] [SPEAKER_00]: and on that topic I think that it's also more accepted now for people to I guess like not openly hate
[00:24:04.000] [SPEAKER_00]：关于这个话题，我觉得现在人们也更容易接受不公开表达仇恨这种行为了。
[00:24:12.760] [SPEAKER_00]: people but like express their dislike of people or situations it's more of a like yeah you don't
[00:24:12.760] [SPEAKER_00]：人们表达对人或事的厌恶，更像是“是啊，你不会”这种感觉。
[00:24:19.620] [SPEAKER_00]: have to pretend you just like everything it's okay to be like oh yeah I don't vibe with this person
[00:24:19.620] [SPEAKER_00]：你得假装喜欢一切，就算心里想着“哦，我跟这个人合不来”也没关系。
[00:24:25.320] [SPEAKER_00]: as much so I would prefer to like hang out with these other friends that I like more I love that
[00:24:25.320] [SPEAKER_00]：我更喜欢和这些我更喜欢的朋友们一起玩，我喜欢这样。
[00:24:31.400] [SPEAKER_01]: acting out is an option like you can always feel free to opt out of stuff yeah I guess like part
[00:24:31.400] [SPEAKER_01]：反抗也是一种选择，就像你总是可以自由选择退出某些事情一样，是的，我想就像一部分
[00:24:38.180] [SPEAKER_00]: of it is being an apologetic which is you know part of being brat too but of course at the
[00:24:38.180] [SPEAKER_00]：这是一种道歉，你知道，这也是任性的一部分，但当然在……
[00:24:45.320] [SPEAKER_00]: same time as we talked about I don't know it's like such a fine line right because it's like yeah
[00:24:45.320] [SPEAKER_00]：就在我们谈到的时候，我不知道，这就像一条很微妙的界线，对吧？因为就像是……
[00:24:49.400] [SPEAKER_00]: you can openly admit that maybe you dislike you know certain people or things but also like you
[00:24:49.400] [SPEAKER_00]：你可以坦诚地承认，你可能不喜欢某些人或事，但同时也喜欢你。
[00:24:54.740] [SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be too rude about it I guess so you don't want to be giving them a horrible time
[00:24:54.740] [SPEAKER_00]：我想你不想显得太粗鲁，所以你也不想让他们难堪。
[00:24:58.780] [SPEAKER_01]: just because of your own preference and honestly I feel like it's not super uncommon to have
[00:24:58.780] [SPEAKER_01]：这只是你个人的喜好，而且说实话，我觉得这种情况并不算罕见。
[00:25:05.460] [SPEAKER_01]: to interact with someone that you might not really like and there's a lot of techniques that you can
[00:25:05.460] [SPEAKER_01]：与你可能不太喜欢的人互动有很多技巧可以做到。
[00:25:11.120] [SPEAKER_01]: use I feel like one easy go two thing is humor maybe you can try to see if there's some
[00:25:11.120] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得用幽默感比较容易，也许你可以试试看能不能找到一些幽默元素。
[00:25:18.200] [SPEAKER_01]: level of humor that you and this person kind of can meet each other or and then just push that instead
[00:25:18.200] [SPEAKER_01]：你和这个人幽默的程度，你们可以互相认识，然后就顺着这个思路发展下去。
[00:25:23.720] [SPEAKER_01]: of trying to have serious conversations or like something that doesn't seem to work with this person
[00:25:23.720] [SPEAKER_01]：试图与这个人进行严肃的对话或做一些似乎行不通的事情
[00:25:28.600] [SPEAKER_01]: you can just try to make things lighter and make it funny and like cracks and jokes yeah true
[00:25:28.600] [SPEAKER_01]：你可以试着把气氛轻松点，让它变得有趣，比如讲些笑话和俏皮话，对，没错。
[00:25:34.300] [SPEAKER_00]: and I guess like you know ultimately ideal here is you just try to limit your interaction so that
[00:25:34.300] [SPEAKER_00]：我想，最终理想的情况是，你应该尽量减少互动，这样……
[00:25:40.620] [SPEAKER_00]: no one has to deal with the shitty situation of spending time with people they might not want to
[00:25:40.620] [SPEAKER_00]：没有人需要面对和自己可能不想相处的人共度时光这种糟糕的情况。
[00:25:47.150] [SPEAKER_00]: but what if and this is probably a very difficult question what if it's someone you see a lot
[00:25:47.150] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，如果——这可能是一个很难回答的问题——如果是你经常见到的人呢？
[00:25:55.070] [SPEAKER_00]: because of maybe mutual friends or history of friendship have you ever had to like deal with that
[00:25:55.070] [SPEAKER_00]：可能是因为共同的朋友或者过去的友谊，你有没有遇到过这种情况？
[00:26:02.290] [SPEAKER_01]: so definitely not in recent years but I think back in high school and college this was way more common
[00:26:02.290] [SPEAKER_01]：所以近年来肯定不是这样了，但我觉得在高中和大学时期，这种情况要普遍得多。
[00:26:09.990] [SPEAKER_01]: and if you like there's like only two paths out that I have seen so one is like you said limit
[00:26:09.990] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你愿意的话，我看到的只有两条出路，一条就像你说的，是限制。
[00:26:18.510] [SPEAKER_01]: all interaction but this can be kind of hard say this person is in your friend group or something
[00:26:18.510] [SPEAKER_01]：所有互动都很难，比如说这个人是你的朋友圈成员之类的。
[00:26:24.690] [SPEAKER_01]: and you guys always hang out you can't just like ignore one person out of however many people
[00:26:24.690] [SPEAKER_01]：你们总是聚在一起，不可能从那么多人中忽略一个人。
[00:26:30.330] [SPEAKER_01]: they're like that's just weird and not only is it weird for both of you it's also weird for
[00:26:30.330] [SPEAKER_01]：他们会说这很奇怪，不仅对你们俩来说很奇怪，对其他人来说也很奇怪。
[00:26:34.770] [SPEAKER_01]: everyone else around you true so if you're unable to like avoid conversation with them I feel like
[00:26:34.770] [SPEAKER_01]：你周围的其他人都是这样，所以如果你无法避免和他们交谈，我觉得
[00:26:41.050] [SPEAKER_01]: the next best way is find one thing and then every time you see them you like talk about that one
[00:26:41.050] [SPEAKER_01]：次好的方法是找到一个共同点，然后每次见到他们就谈论这个共同点。
[00:26:47.010] [SPEAKER_01]: thing and then you just leave it at that so I'll be like talking yeah but you can just be like
[00:26:47.010] [SPEAKER_01]：然后你就别说了，所以我会说，是啊，但你可以就那样。
[00:26:51.690] [SPEAKER_01]: how's your dog and then that's it you like walk away after the conversation but at least you
[00:26:51.690] [SPEAKER_01]：你的狗怎么样了？然后就结束了对话，你就像走开一样，但至少你
[00:26:56.110] [SPEAKER_00]: talked you know right right right basically put in some effort to be cordial yeah I feel like dislike
[00:26:56.110] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，说了，对对对，基本上努力表现得友好，是啊，我觉得不喜欢
[00:27:02.910] [SPEAKER_01]: to can be general but sometimes it's also like specific like you might not like a specific person
[00:27:02.910] [SPEAKER_01]：它可以是泛指，但有时也可以是特指，比如你可能不喜欢某个特定的人。
[00:27:08.870] [SPEAKER_01]: when they drink or you might not like a specific person when they play sports or like talk about
[00:27:08.870] [SPEAKER_01]：当他们喝酒的时候，或者你可能不喜欢某个特定的人，当他们打球或者喜欢谈论……
[00:27:14.510] [SPEAKER_01]: politics or something so then you just identify what the pain points are and then like steer
[00:27:14.510] [SPEAKER_01]：政治之类的，所以你只需要找出痛点，然后引导……
[00:27:19.050] [SPEAKER_00]: clear as far as possible that's true and I think it would be fair if say like a conversation
[00:27:19.050] [SPEAKER_00]：尽可能清楚地说明情况属实，我认为如果像对话那样进行讨论会很公平。
[00:27:24.630] [SPEAKER_00]: topic came up and you're like oh guys I don't want to talk about this and then you know try to like
[00:27:24.630] [SPEAKER_00]：话题一出现，你就说“哦，伙计们，我不想谈这个”，然后你知道，试着……
[00:27:30.190] [SPEAKER_00]: avoid that discomfort right have you ever been in a situation like that I think luckily not in a
[00:27:30.190] [SPEAKER_00]：避免那种不适感，对吧？你有没有遇到过类似的情况？我想幸运的是，我没有。
[00:27:39.110] [SPEAKER_00]: situation where like I've had to constantly see someone who I don't want to okay honestly I think
[00:27:39.110] [SPEAKER_00]：这种情况就是我不得不一直见到我不想见的人，说实话，我觉得
[00:27:50.350] [SPEAKER_00]: I very luckily don't have like intense hatred for anyone but you know maybe like a minor dislike
[00:27:50.350] [SPEAKER_00]：我很幸运，对任何人都没有强烈的仇恨，但你知道，可能有点轻微的反感吧。
[00:27:57.090] [SPEAKER_00]: if I can avoid it like I'll try not to hang out with this person as much but I think in the few
[00:27:57.090] [SPEAKER_00]：如果可以避免的话，我会尽量少和这个人来往，但我认为在少数情况下……
[00:28:03.110] [SPEAKER_00]: times that I do I just try my best to like enjoy the moment you know like don't let this
[00:28:03.110] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候我会尽力享受当下，你知道，就像不要让这件事影响到我。
[00:28:10.350] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling ruin the night for everyone that kind of feeling and I think it usually tends to help
[00:28:10.350] [SPEAKER_00]：那种感觉会毁了所有人的夜晚，我觉得它通常会有帮助。
[00:28:16.690] [SPEAKER_00]: and when you try to keep a more positive mindset I think it does help you see like the good sides
[00:28:16.690] [SPEAKER_00]：当你努力保持更积极的心态时，我认为这确实有助于你看到事物好的一面。
[00:28:24.150] [SPEAKER_00]: of that person that you dislike as well I mean like you know that doesn't mean that it has to
[00:28:24.150] [SPEAKER_00]：对于你讨厌的那个人，我的意思是，你知道，这并不意味着它必须……
[00:28:29.770] [SPEAKER_00]: change necessarily like oh suddenly I love them now but I think it just helps you get through
[00:28:29.770] [SPEAKER_00]：改变不一定是突然之间我就爱上他们了，但我认为这只是帮助你度过难关。
[00:28:35.370] [SPEAKER_00]: that moment like just don't let your dislike consume you and try to just like let go of some
[00:28:35.370] [SPEAKER_00]：那一刻，就像不要让你的厌恶吞噬你，试着放下一些东西。
[00:28:42.090] [SPEAKER_00]: of that you know control I guess just like whatever like everyone's just here to have fun
[00:28:42.090] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，控制权嘛，我想大概就是随便吧，反正大家来这儿都是为了开心。
[00:28:47.450] [SPEAKER_01]: yeah actually that's a really good point because I feel like the more you get to know someone
[00:28:47.450] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，这确实是个很好的观点，因为我觉得你越了解一个人，就越能体会到这一点。
[00:28:52.410] [SPEAKER_01]: it's harder and harder to dislike them which is why maybe sometimes it's a harder of a hill
[00:28:52.410] [SPEAKER_01]：越来越难讨厌他们了，所以也许有时候爬坡也更难。
[00:28:58.030] [SPEAKER_01]: to start disliking like a family member or something because you know so much about them and they're
[00:28:58.030] [SPEAKER_01]：开始讨厌某个家庭成员之类的，因为你对他们了解太多，而他们……
[00:29:03.450] [SPEAKER_01]: like upbringing and they're like background and whatnot and maybe that's also why it's like
[00:29:03.450] [SPEAKER_01]：比如成长经历、背景等等，也许这也是为什么会这样
[00:29:09.390] [SPEAKER_01]: easy to hype on the hate train of someone you like barely know because you don't know like redeeming
[00:29:09.390] [SPEAKER_01]：很容易因为不了解自己喜欢的人，就盲目地加入到对某人的仇恨浪潮中，就像在洗白一样。
[00:29:14.730] [SPEAKER_00]: qualities about them that's true that's true and I think you can totally see that in media too like
[00:29:14.730] [SPEAKER_00]：关于他们的这些品质，确实如此，确实如此，而且我认为你也能在媒体上看到这一点，比如
[00:29:21.110] [SPEAKER_00]: there's social media stars or celebrities or something we only know so much about this person right
[00:29:21.110] [SPEAKER_00]：有些社交媒体明星、名人之类的，我们对他们的了解其实非常有限，对吧？
[00:29:26.230] [SPEAKER_00]: whatever is put out into the media for everyone to see and so it's really easy for people to form
[00:29:26.230] [SPEAKER_00]：任何通过媒体发布给所有人的信息，都很容易让人们形成某种观念。
[00:29:32.610] [SPEAKER_00]: opinions when like we don't actually know that person true and I feel like this is why gossip
[00:29:32.610] [SPEAKER_00]：当我们并不真正了解一个人时，就很容易发表意见，我觉得这就是八卦的本质。
[00:29:39.590] [SPEAKER_01]: when you're older is like a little bit less serious than it was when you're younger like I don't
[00:29:39.590] [SPEAKER_01]：年纪大了之后，事情就没那么严肃了，就像我……
[00:29:51.090] [SPEAKER_01]: crazy or like I can't believe this person did that and then now I'm probably more likely to take it
[00:29:51.090] [SPEAKER_01]：简直疯了，或者说我不敢相信这个人会这么做，现在我可能更愿意接受它了。
[00:29:57.050] [SPEAKER_01]: with a grain of salt we might have fun and like gossip about it but I'm not gonna like go home thinking
[00:29:57.050] [SPEAKER_01]：带着怀疑的态度，我们或许可以玩得开心，也喜欢八卦一下，但我不会带着这种想法回家。
[00:30:02.730] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah this person is like truly a horrible person yeah you're so right I was thinking of the exact same
[00:30:02.730] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，这个人真是个很糟糕的人。你说得太对了，我也是这么想的。
[00:30:08.550] [SPEAKER_00]: term like I would take gossip with a grain of salt or I feel like sometimes what's really juicy
[00:30:08.550] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我会对八卦持保留态度，或者我觉得有时候真正劲爆的八卦是什么。
[00:30:14.230] [SPEAKER_00]: about a piece of gossip is the situation and then maybe that kicks off the conversation
[00:30:14.230] [SPEAKER_00]：事情的起因可能是一个八卦，然后也许就此展开了对话。
[00:30:20.630] [SPEAKER_00]: and then it evolves into like hypotheticals like wow what would we do if we were in this situation
[00:30:20.630] [SPEAKER_00]：然后就演变成假设性的问题，比如，哇，如果我们身处这种情况该怎么办？
[00:30:25.790] [SPEAKER_00]: it like goes beyond just their original little piece of gossip right but this does bring me to ask
[00:30:25.790] [SPEAKER_00]：这似乎已经超越了他们最初那点小小的八卦了，对吧？但这确实让我想到一个问题。
[00:30:32.290] [SPEAKER_01]: because going back to how gossip felt super serious kind of in high school I feel like the
[00:30:32.290] [SPEAKER_01]：因为回想起高中时八卦这件事，感觉特别严肃，我觉得……
[00:30:38.790] [SPEAKER_01]: other thing in high school that was big was if your friend hates someone then you are like send me
[00:30:38.790] [SPEAKER_01]：高中时还有一件很流行的事，就是如果你的朋友讨厌某人，你就会想：把我送过去！
[00:30:46.450] [SPEAKER_01]: obligated to hate them as well so were you or are you currently a believer that you're obligated
[00:30:46.450] [SPEAKER_01]：你也有义务憎恨他们，那么你过去或现在是否也认为你有义务憎恨他们？
[00:30:52.870] [SPEAKER_00]: to hate the people your friends hate who I think I was in high school and I think it comes from
[00:30:52.870] [SPEAKER_00]：讨厌你的朋友讨厌的人，我觉得我高中时就是这样，我觉得这源于……
[00:30:59.390] [SPEAKER_00]: the place of like I want to support my friend right so if they're like oh my god this person was
[00:30:59.390] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我想支持我的朋友一样，所以如果他们说“哦我的天哪，这个人……”
[00:31:04.570] [SPEAKER_00]: bothering me I don't like them then you're like oh yeah you're totally in the right you're
[00:31:04.570] [SPEAKER_00]：他们让我很烦，我不喜欢他们，然后你就说，哦，是的，你完全对，你是
[00:31:09.410] [SPEAKER_00]: valid blah blah blah I think that's where it kind of comes from and I think also it's a little
[00:31:09.410] [SPEAKER_00]：有效的……等等等等，我想这就是它的由来，而且我觉得也有点……
[00:31:13.710] [SPEAKER_00]: different because you know when we're in that age range a big thing that we're worried about is like
[00:31:13.710] [SPEAKER_00]：不一样，因为你知道，当我们处于那个年龄段时，我们最担心的事情之一就是……
[00:31:19.750] [SPEAKER_00]: oh I want to fit in I want to have friends I want to have like a place where I feel comfortable
[00:31:19.750] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，我想融入群体，我想交朋友，我想拥有一个让我感到舒适的地方。
[00:31:24.170] [SPEAKER_00]: so sometimes you even just like brainwash yourself into thinking like I have to
[00:31:24.170] [SPEAKER_00]：所以有时候你甚至会给自己洗脑，让自己觉得我必须……
[00:31:34.550] [SPEAKER_00]: think right so I think as we've gone older maybe not as much but I think it still leaves an
[00:31:34.550] [SPEAKER_00]：想想看，随着我们年纪渐长，也许这种感觉会减弱，但我认为这仍然会留下……
[00:31:43.450] [SPEAKER_00]: impression on me like if someone were to say oh my god this person was like so rude that
[00:31:43.450] [SPEAKER_00]：给我的印象就像有人说“我的天哪，这个人太没礼貌了”一样。
[00:31:48.350] [SPEAKER_00]: becomes my first impression of them and so rather than them starting at like a neutral
[00:31:48.350] [SPEAKER_00]：这成了我对他们的第一印象，所以他们一开始并不是中立的。
[00:31:54.030] [SPEAKER_00]: for me when I meet them next time they're like ever so slightly in the negative. I don't want
[00:31:54.030] [SPEAKER_00]：对我来说，下次见到他们时，感觉他们有点不太友好。我不想这样。
[00:32:01.350] [SPEAKER_00]: they were rude to my friend that's basically an interaction with me. I totally feel that actually
[00:32:01.350] [SPEAKER_00]：他们对我朋友很粗鲁，这基本上就是跟我之间的互动。我完全感同身受。
[00:32:07.810] [SPEAKER_01]: I was also very much in the camp of like if you wrong my friend you have wronged me back in high
[00:32:07.810] [SPEAKER_01]：我以前在高中时也非常认同这种观点，认为如果你得罪了我的朋友，就等于得罪了我。
[00:32:14.170] [SPEAKER_01]: school and honestly probably most of college as well so I kind of saw it as like a stamp of loyalty
[00:32:14.170] [SPEAKER_01]：在学校，说实话，大学的大部分时间也是，所以我把它看作是一种忠诚的印记。
[00:32:20.530] [SPEAKER_01]: thing which thinking back that's not really how it works but of course there's also a difference
[00:32:20.530] [SPEAKER_01]：现在回想起来，事情并非如此运作，当然，两者之间也存在差异。
[00:32:26.770] [SPEAKER_01]: between whether someone was mildly annoying to your friend and whether they were like truly
[00:32:26.770] [SPEAKER_01]：这介于某人只是略微惹恼你的朋友和他们真的非常惹恼你朋友之间。
[00:32:31.610] [SPEAKER_01]: offensive and like bothersome to your friend as well. Yes very true but yeah agree that in adulthood
[00:32:31.610] [SPEAKER_01]：这既冒犯又会打扰你的朋友。是的，确实如此，但同意，在成年人的世界里……
[00:32:37.990] [SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't feel as like okay my bestie hates this person therefore I do too but I will say like
[00:32:37.990] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉不像“好吧，我最好的朋友讨厌这个人，所以我也讨厌他”，但我还是要说……
[00:32:45.050] [SPEAKER_01]: if you and your friend have similar preferences or similar like values and stuff I think it does
[00:32:45.050] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你和你的朋友有相似的喜好或价值观等等，我认为这确实会有帮助。
[00:32:50.810] [SPEAKER_01]: still kind of end up that way. Like you might generally like or dislike similar groups of people
[00:32:50.810] [SPEAKER_01]：最终还是会变成那样。比如你可能通常会喜欢或讨厌相似类型的人群。
[00:32:56.630] [SPEAKER_00]: agreed and I think you're right to that if like someone truly did wrong your friend and like
[00:32:56.630] [SPEAKER_00]：同意，我觉得你说得对，如果有人真的做错了事，比如你的朋友……
[00:33:02.090] [SPEAKER_00]: you know did horrible things to them did stuff that had horrible lasting impact. I would definitely
[00:33:02.090] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，你对他们做了可怕的事情，做了造成可怕且持久影响的事情。我肯定会
[00:33:07.790] [SPEAKER_00]: lean towards the oh yeah I probably hate this person too but this does kind of remind me of like
[00:33:07.790] [SPEAKER_00]：倾向于认为，哦，是的，我可能也讨厌这个人，但这确实让我想起了……
[00:33:14.950] [SPEAKER_00]: the funny situation when it's like you know maybe you didn't really vibe with someone at a party
[00:33:14.950] [SPEAKER_00]：那种在派对上感觉和某人不太合得来，挺搞笑的。
[00:33:19.930] [SPEAKER_00]: or at a social gathering and you didn't ask one of your good friends yet how they feel about
[00:33:19.930] [SPEAKER_00]：或者在社交聚会上，你还没问过你的好朋友对……的看法
[00:33:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]: that person and you're trying to gauge like oh shoot did they actually it's like this person
[00:33:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]：那个人，你试图判断，哦，糟糕，他们真的……就像这个人一样
[00:33:30.810] [SPEAKER_00]: or or are we allowed to like discuss why they rubbed me the wrong way right and it's like
[00:33:30.810] [SPEAKER_00]：或者，我们能不能讨论一下他们为什么让我不舒服？就像……
[00:33:38.050] [SPEAKER_00]: you're towing the line you're like yeah um so what do you think about so and so
[00:33:38.050] [SPEAKER_00]：你循规蹈矩，就像“嗯，那你对某某有什么看法？”
[00:33:44.130] [SPEAKER_00]: did you get a chance to like talk to them? Oh like who is going to be the first one to break
[00:33:44.130] [SPEAKER_00]：你有没有机会跟他们聊聊？比如，谁会是第一个打破常规的人？
[00:33:49.110] [SPEAKER_00]: the wall and be like oh my god like they did this really rude thing to me and yeah I don't
[00:33:49.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我冲着墙说，我的天哪，他们对我做了这么没礼貌的事，是的，我没有
[00:33:53.070] [SPEAKER_01]: know how to feel about them because you don't want to be the one who's like god wasn't that guy so
[00:33:53.070] [SPEAKER_01]：要知道该如何看待他们，因为你不想成为那个后悔莫及的人，比如感叹“上帝啊，那家伙怎么这么糟糕”。
[00:33:58.210] [SPEAKER_01]: weird and then your friend's like oh I thought he was really cool yeah like a great conversation
[00:33:58.210] [SPEAKER_01]：很奇怪，然后你的朋友会说，哦，我觉得他真的很酷，是啊，就像聊得很开心一样。
[00:34:02.830] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah because then part of it you're like oh shit it must be me like I need to check myself like
[00:34:02.830] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，因为有时候你会想，哦，糟了，肯定是我自己的问题，我得好好反省一下自己。
[00:34:07.450] [SPEAKER_01]: why am I hating on these people? Exactly although I feel like there's always a key word to like
[00:34:07.450] [SPEAKER_01]：我为什么讨厌这些人？没错，虽然我觉得总有一个关键词可以让我“喜欢”他们。
[00:34:16.150] [SPEAKER_01]: out for anytime someone's like yeah that was interesting or like he's interesting I feel like
[00:34:16.150] [SPEAKER_01]：随时有人说“是啊，这很有趣”或者“他很有趣，我觉得”的时候都可以。
[00:34:21.950] [SPEAKER_01]: it usually opens the door just a little bit of like shit talk territory and like the tone
[00:34:21.950] [SPEAKER_01]：它通常会稍微打开一扇门，让人可以开始说些闲话，就像那种语气一样。
[00:34:27.490] [SPEAKER_00]: of voice as well the pauses like he was interesting versus he was interesting but you know
[00:34:27.490] [SPEAKER_00]：声音里还有停顿，比如“他很有趣”和“他很有趣，但是你知道”
[00:34:37.010] [SPEAKER_01]: all this to say I will be the first swim I'm not above a good shit talk set sometimes it just clears
[00:34:37.010] [SPEAKER_01]：总而言之，我会第一个下水，我并不排斥偶尔来点垃圾话，有时候就是能把事情说清楚。
[00:34:44.650] [SPEAKER_01]: the mind and it doesn't even have to be like deep from your soul it's just like light
[00:34:44.650] [SPEAKER_01]：心灵，甚至不必是源自灵魂深处的那种感觉，它就像一道光。
[00:34:49.950] [SPEAKER_00]: goss and then you like move on with your life sometimes it can be as simple as oh my god like
[00:34:49.950] [SPEAKER_00]：八卦之后，你就像继续你的生活一样，有时候事情可能很简单，比如“我的天哪”
[00:34:54.550] [SPEAKER_00]: this person was so rude to me like they didn't respond when I tried to have a conversation with them
[00:34:54.550] [SPEAKER_00]：这个人对我太没礼貌了，我试图和他/她交谈，他/她根本不回应。
[00:35:00.710] [SPEAKER_00]: and you just need to like fend it out and then after that you're like okay I feel a lot better now
[00:35:00.710] [SPEAKER_00]：你只需要坚持下去，之后你就会觉得，好了，我现在感觉好多了。
[00:35:06.990] [SPEAKER_01]: too and sometimes I kind of reset you until like neutral territory with that person again
[00:35:06.990] [SPEAKER_01]：也是，有时候我会把你拉回到和那个人之间的中立状态。
[00:35:11.770] [SPEAKER_01]: like oh I like got my feelings about this out so next time I see him I won't feel like
[00:35:11.770] [SPEAKER_01]：就像，哦，我把我的感受说出来了，这样下次见到他的时候我就不会觉得……
[00:35:16.630] [SPEAKER_00]: resentment or anything true ultimately I guess like sometimes it sucks to admit or like just say
[00:35:16.630] [SPEAKER_00]：怨恨或者任何最终真实的想法，我想有时候承认这一点很糟糕，或者就这么说吧。
[00:35:22.650] [SPEAKER_00]: out loud but sometimes it is inevitable to feel that dislike and I don't know if I'm like seeing
[00:35:22.650] [SPEAKER_00]：大声说出来，但有时难免会感到厌恶，我不知道我是不是像看到……
[00:35:29.410] [SPEAKER_00]: this in the most understandable way but I just think there's like always gonna be some facet of you that
[00:35:29.410] [SPEAKER_00]：这很容易理解，但我认为你身上总会有一些方面……
[00:35:36.590] [SPEAKER_00]: is gonna like cause someone else dislike you or you know someone else has some part that makes you
[00:35:36.590] [SPEAKER_00]：你会喜欢别人不喜欢你，或者你知道别人身上有某些特质让你讨厌。
[00:35:43.310] [SPEAKER_00]: dislike them it's just like inevitable no two people are like 100% match everyone will always have
[00:35:43.310] [SPEAKER_00]：不喜欢它们也是不可避免的，没有两个人是完全一样的，每个人都会有缺点。
[00:35:49.650] [SPEAKER_00]: conflict somehow some way and I guess like the most we can do is just figure out how to deal with
[00:35:49.650] [SPEAKER_00]：冲突总会以某种方式出现，我想我们能做的最多就是想办法解决。
[00:35:57.290] [SPEAKER_00]: it on our own side you know how to like owe it or like process that emotion or just avoid it if
[00:35:57.290] [SPEAKER_00]：在我们自己这边，你知道该如何处理这种情绪，或者干脆回避它。
[00:36:04.530] [SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna like bother you a lot it's funny talking to you about this because like you said
[00:36:04.530] [SPEAKER_01]：这件事可能会让你很烦恼，跟你谈这个挺有意思的，因为就像你说的。
[00:36:10.830] [SPEAKER_01]: everyone has like one person or something or another that they dislike but the concept of disliking
[00:36:10.830] [SPEAKER_01]：每个人都有自己不喜欢的人或事，但“不喜欢”这个概念本身却并非如此简单。
[00:36:17.950] [SPEAKER_01]: people isn't really discussed like this yeah so then my personal takeaways is like one honestly
[00:36:17.950] [SPEAKER_01]：人们很少这样讨论，所以，我个人的感想是这样的：
[00:36:25.290] [SPEAKER_01]: it's like unserious and like you said unavoidable twin extent so doesn't have to be like super emotional
[00:36:25.290] [SPEAKER_01]：这就像开玩笑一样，就像你说的，双胞胎之间不可避免的联系，所以不必太情绪化。
[00:36:32.590] [SPEAKER_01]: to like dislike or get disliked by someone and two sometimes the root of the dislike is
[00:36:32.590] [SPEAKER_01]：喜欢、不喜欢或被某人不喜欢，以及有时不喜欢的根源是
[00:36:39.970] [SPEAKER_01]: from within you the color is coming from inside the house so if you are the problem recognize it
[00:36:39.970] [SPEAKER_01]：你内心的色彩源自你的内心，所以如果你是问题所在，就认清它。
[00:36:47.370] [SPEAKER_01]: and just be like yeah I'm like a hater today or like I'm in my hater era so ignore me you know
[00:36:47.370] [SPEAKER_01]：然后就说，是啊，我今天就是个喷子，或者说，我正处于我的喷子时期，所以别理我，你知道的。
[00:36:53.970] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah I totally agree sometimes you just got a fucking hater a little bit
[00:36:53.970] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，我完全同意，有时候你就是会遇到一个讨厌你的人。
[00:36:59.730] [SPEAKER_00]: but in a self-aware way yeah it would be impossible to never have negative emotions
[00:36:59.730] [SPEAKER_00]：但从自我意识的角度来看，完全不产生负面情绪是不可能的。
[00:37:07.730] [SPEAKER_00]: sometimes an unfortunate bystander will take the brunt of your hater whether it's behind closed doors
[00:37:07.730] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候，不幸的旁观者会替你承受仇恨者的怒火，无论这种仇恨是在私下里还是在幕后。
[00:37:15.550] [SPEAKER_01]: or out in public yeah and like we said it might not always be permanent it might just be like a
[00:37:15.550] [SPEAKER_01]：或者在公共场合，是的，就像我们说的，这可能不是永久性的，可能只是……
[00:37:21.970] [SPEAKER_01]: very temporary feeling and then the next time you see this person you might be best friends it's not an
[00:37:21.970] [SPEAKER_01]：这种感觉很短暂，下次见到这个人时，你们可能就成为最好的朋友了，这不是什么。
[00:37:27.870] [SPEAKER_01]: end all be all kind of situation either for sure so for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts
[00:37:27.870] [SPEAKER_01]：这肯定是一种最终结果，所以，各位听众，如果您有什么想法，请不吝赐教。
