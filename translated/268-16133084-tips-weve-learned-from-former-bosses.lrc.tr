[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. Today, before we dive into our topic, we do have a slang word to discuss. I think today's word is pretty funny. You and I actually use it a decent amount right now. I hear it a lot. And I think its use has been pretty consistent so far over the course of like this year. And the word is glaze.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。今天，在我们正式进入正题之前，先来聊聊一个俚语。我觉得今天的这个词挺有意思的。你我最近都经常用到它。我经常听到。而且我觉得它在今年以来的使用频率一直都很高。这个词就是“glaze”（釉料）。
[00:00:37.780] So the way glaze is used is to actually mean to pile on compliments, essentially. It kind of refers to like a glazed donut. Like you're adding the glaze onto a donut to like really just send it home that this is great.
[00:00:37.780] 所以，“glaze”这个词的用法实际上是指锦上添花，基本上就是赞美之词。它有点像给甜甜圈淋上糖霜。就像在甜甜圈上淋糖霜，是为了真正地告诉大家，这东西太棒了。
[00:00:55.980] And I think this word has especially been topical for Crystal and I since we've been playing fantasy, as many of you guys know. Every week, someone will be like, oh, this person's team looks so good. I'm so scared to play them. They're racking up all the points. Inevitably, someone else would comment like, dude, stop glazing this person's team.
[00:00:55.980] 我觉得这个词对我和克里斯托来说尤其重要，因为我们一直在玩梦幻体育游戏，你们很多人都知道。每周都会有人说：“哇，这人的队伍看起来太强了，我都不敢跟他们打，他们得分太高了！” 但总会有人评论说：“哥们儿，别这么吹捧这人的队伍了。”
[00:01:15.420] So I think its usage is so versatile. There's a ton of glazing going on in this world. I feel like I've seen it refer to more serious issues as well. Because, you know, there's a ton of glazing, a ton of people making someone look or seem better than it might actually be.
[00:01:15.420] 所以我认为它的用法非常广泛。这个世界上充斥着各种各样的粉饰。我觉得我也见过它被用来指代更严肃的问题。因为，你知道，现在到处都是粉饰，很多人都在美化别人，让别人看起来比实际情况更好。
[00:01:33.760] Yeah. And I think it's definitely used a lot in exaggeration, but I think sometimes it's well-deserved too. So I see it a lot in like the gaming community or as you said, in fantasy football, because the app that we use has really good commentability features.
[00:01:33.760] 是的。我觉得这个词确实经常被用来夸张，但有时候也确实名副其实。比如在游戏圈，或者像你说的，在梦幻足球圈，我就经常看到这种情况，因为我们用的那个app的评论功能真的很好用。
[00:01:51.880] So every crazy play, people can make comments about it. For example, this past week, there was this crazy game where someone played just an amazing fantasy game and scored like one of the highest points ever. The comments are super funny, but they're also definitely like glazing. So one of the top comments is literally like, I assume this is what sex feels like.
[00:01:51.880] 所以，每次出现精彩的操作，大家都会发表评论。比如，上周就有人玩了一个超棒的奇幻游戏，拿到了有史以来最高的分数之一。评论超级搞笑，但也确实有点让人昏昏欲睡。其中一条热门评论竟然是：“我猜这就是性爱的感觉吧。”
[00:02:19.400] Those are examples of like, well-deserved glaze. But you're right, there's definitely also the other side where it's way more exaggerated and people like to call each other out like, hey, stop glazing this person or whatever.
[00:02:19.400] 这些都是理所应当的赞美。但你说得对，肯定也有另一种极端情况，有些人赞美得过头了，甚至会互相指责，比如“嘿，别再赞美这个人了”之类的。
[00:02:32.820] Right. And my personal favorite is when it might not be a glaze, like you're not intending for it to be a glaze, but then things happen. And then in hindsight, you realize it was a glaze.
[00:02:32.820] 没错。我个人最喜欢的情况是，它一开始可能并非釉面，比如你原本没打算用釉，但后来发生了一些意想不到的事情。事后回想起来，你才意识到它其实就是釉面。
[00:02:42.860] So one example is like a football player pops off one week and you're like, holy shit, this guy's so good. You're showering him with compliments. And then a couple of weeks later, you've realized it was all foam and bubbles and he's not actually that good.
[00:02:42.860] 举个例子，就像某个足球运动员突然在一周内表现出色，你惊叹道：“我的天哪，这家伙太厉害了！” 你对他赞不绝口。但几周后，你意识到这一切都是虚张声势，他实际上并没有那么厉害。
[00:02:56.920] Or just fantasy wise, he's underperforming to where your expectations were.
[00:02:56.920] 或者仅仅从幻想层面来说，他的表现低于你的预期。
[00:03:01.060] Yeah.
[00:03:01.060] 是的。
[00:03:01.760] So then people would be like, yeah, all you guys fucking glazed this dude a couple of weeks ago. And now he's putting out like one to two fantasy points a week.
[00:03:01.760] 所以人们就会说，是啊，你们几周前都把这家伙吹得落花流水。结果现在他每周只能拿到一到两个梦幻积分。
[00:03:10.460] Like, so hindsight declaration of something being a glaze is just also hilarious.
[00:03:10.460] 比如，事后断言某样东西是釉料，这本身就很滑稽。
[00:03:15.660] Yes. I see it a lot in the gaming community too. People make cool plays or if they, you know, play a game and they performed really well. So very similar to like fantasy football.
[00:03:15.660] 是的。我在游戏圈也经常看到这种情况。人们会做出精彩的操作，或者玩某个游戏时表现出色。这和梦幻足球很像。
[00:03:26.160] And then maybe the casters or people who are watching or like Twitch chat or whoever, they'll be like, holy shit, like you're so good. This person's crazy. And then everyone's like W glaze or something.
[00:03:26.160] 然后，解说员、观众、Twitch聊天室的其他人，或者其他什么人，可能会惊呼：“我的天哪，你太厉害了！这个人简直疯了！” 然后大家就会说：“W glaze”之类的。
[00:03:41.590] Dude, it's so funny. And this is actually my favorite type of slang word where it's like a real word. It's in the dictionary. It has been a commonly used English word for a long time.
[00:03:41.590] 老兄，这太搞笑了。这其实是我最喜欢的那种俚语，因为它跟真正的单词一样。它收录在字典里，而且长期以来都是英语中常用的词汇。
[00:03:52.190] But this extra layer and like dimension that the slang definition adds is just so funny. Like W glaze is hilarious.
[00:03:52.190] 但俚语定义增添的这层额外含义和维度真的太搞笑了。比如“W glaze”就非常滑稽。
[00:04:01.370] Yeah. Also like another common way people use glaze is to add self in front of it. So sometimes if you're like pumping yourself up, then people be like self glaze. Like whether that's a good thing or bad thing depends on their tone of voice.
[00:04:01.370] 是的。还有一种常见的用法是，人们会在“glaze”前面加上“self”。所以有时候，如果你在给自己打气，人们就会说“self glaze”。至于这是好事还是坏事，就取决于他们的语气了。
[00:04:18.490] Yes. Well, all I'll say is that once you hear this word and once you hear the definition of it, I feel like you see it more and more often.
[00:04:18.490] 是的。嗯，我只能说，一旦你听到这个词，一旦你了解了它的定义，我觉得你就会越来越频繁地看到它。
[00:04:27.030] So I guess if this is new to any of our listeners, you'll definitely start seeing this everywhere.
[00:04:27.030] 所以我想，如果我们的听众中有人是第一次听到这个，那么你们肯定会很快在各处看到它。
[00:04:31.810] It's a fun one.
[00:04:31.810] 这很有趣。
[00:04:33.230] Well, let's move into the topic that we actually have today, which is tips we've picked up from former bosses.
[00:04:33.230] 好，让我们进入今天的主题，也就是我们从前任老板那里学到的一些技巧。
[00:04:40.070] So we are both, I guess it's around six years into our career and have had a handful of different bosses.
[00:04:40.070] 我猜我们俩都入行六年左右了，也换过好几个老板。
[00:04:48.030] It's so funny because I think especially early on in your career, the mannerisms and the stylistic choices and the habits that your boss has is a lot easier to pick up for us.
[00:04:48.030] 这很有趣，因为我觉得尤其是在职业生涯早期，我们更容易模仿老板的举止、风格选择和习惯。
[00:04:59.470] I think as newbies, especially since we don't have our own specific working style developed yet.
[00:04:59.470] 我认为作为新手，尤其是因为我们还没有形成自己独特的工作方式。
[00:05:05.210] So I am very excited to see what kind of tips that you've picked up from your bosses.
[00:05:05.210] 我很期待看到你从老板那里学到了哪些技巧。
[00:05:09.030] So you're saying we're glazing our bosses?
[00:05:09.030] 所以你的意思是说，我们在给老板们涂上釉料？
[00:05:13.310] Honestly, it's not always a glaze.
[00:05:13.310] 说实话，它并不总是一层釉。
[00:05:15.370] I think it could go either way, actually.
[00:05:15.370] 我觉得结果其实两种可能性都有。
[00:05:17.250] But I will say, even if you have a boss that you might not fit in with or prefer, there's always something that you learn from your boss.
[00:05:17.250] 但我想说的是，即使你遇到一个你不太合得来或者不喜欢的上司，你总能从上司身上学到一些东西。
[00:05:26.850] Very true.
[00:05:26.850] 确实如此。
[00:05:27.530] To start us off, I did actually have a not great boss for a little bit.
[00:05:27.530] 首先，我的确有一段时间遇到过一个不太好的老板。
[00:05:33.190] And you're right, I did learn a lot from that situation.
[00:05:33.190] 你说得对，我确实从那件事中学到了很多。
[00:05:36.970] One of the most important things I learned in that situation was how to recognize a boss that didn't work well with me and why.
[00:05:36.970] 在那段经历中，我学到的最重要的事情之一就是如何识别与我相处不融洽的老板以及原因。
[00:05:46.870] I think the biggest reason was that I was still pretty young in my career and I just didn't feel like I was learning.
[00:05:46.870] 我认为最大的原因是我当时职业生涯还很年轻，感觉自己没有学到什么东西。
[00:05:54.690] I felt very stagnant and my thought was, this can't be everything.
[00:05:54.690] 我感觉自己停滞不前，心想，这不可能是全部。
[00:06:00.850] I am so fresh in the workforce.
[00:06:00.850] 我刚入职场不久。
[00:06:04.290] I can't just be like sitting here twiddling my thumbs.
[00:06:04.290] 我不能就这么坐在这里无所事事。
[00:06:07.370] I should at least be feeling I'm learning from even just watching or attending meetings or like seeing events.
[00:06:07.370] 即使只是旁听或参加会议，或者观看活动，我也应该至少感觉自己有所收获。
[00:06:18.170] Just anything that I can learn from.
[00:06:18.170] 任何能让我学习的东西。
[00:06:20.330] But I realized that I was just sitting there and it was comfortable too, right?
[00:06:20.330] 但我意识到我只是坐在那里，而且也很舒服，对吧？
[00:06:25.350] It was like I could sit there and like quietly read books in the corner of my screen and just like not even have to do much all day.
[00:06:25.350] 感觉就像我可以坐在那里，安静地在屏幕角落里看书，一整天都不用做任何事。
[00:06:35.230] And I was realizing like this is not good.
[00:06:35.230] 我当时意识到，这样不好。
[00:06:38.130] Maybe I would want to be this chill later in life, but at this age I should be trying to improve, learning the ropes, really just like setting myself up for future successes.
[00:06:38.130] 也许我以后会想保持这种淡定的心态，但在这个年纪，我应该努力提升自己，学习各种技能，为未来的成功做好准备。
[00:06:51.190] And so I really started to contemplate if it was time to leave, even if it meant leaving early.
[00:06:51.190] 于是我开始认真考虑是否该离开了，即使这意味着要提前离开。
[00:06:57.190] Before the typical suggested like stay at least a year.
[00:06:57.190] 通常建议至少待一年。
[00:07:02.850] Do you think there was anything that your boss could have done or was maybe not doing that could have helped your situation?
[00:07:02.850] 你认为你的老板有没有什么可以做或者没做的事情，能够帮助你改善这种情况？
[00:07:11.470] Because I think sometimes the problem is the work itself and then half the time it's like the boss, right?
[00:07:11.470] 因为我觉得有时候问题出在工作本身，而有一半时间问题出在老板身上，对吧？
[00:07:17.810] Right.
[00:07:17.810] 正确的。
[00:07:18.330] I think the boss had not been a manager yet.
[00:07:18.330] 我认为老板当时还没有当过经理。
[00:07:22.930] And I'm just going to blame it on like the chain of command.
[00:07:22.930] 我打算把责任推卸给上级领导。
[00:07:26.170] I think that this company didn't have as much structure as some of the bigger corporations that I've been a part of.
[00:07:26.170] 我认为这家公司的组织结构不如我曾经待过的一些大型公司那么完善。
[00:07:34.730] So I could really see through that very quickly that this person became a manager and they didn't really know what to do in terms of assigning projects, career check-ins.
[00:07:34.730] 所以我很快就看出，这个人当上了经理，却不知道该如何分配项目、进行职业发展评估。
[00:07:48.270] I don't know, I guess like general manager duties.
[00:07:48.270] 我不知道，大概就是总经理的职责吧。
[00:07:52.370] So I could see through it pretty quickly, especially because in previous jobs, even like internships, I could see this chain of command and my managers would have control and confidence in utilizing me.
[00:07:52.370] 所以我很快就看穿了这一点，尤其是我在以前的工作中，即使是实习生，我也能看到这种指挥链，我的经理们会掌控局面，并且有信心使用我。
[00:08:07.950] And I think I noticed I was like, oh, like, did I even need to be hired?
[00:08:07.950] 我想我当时意识到，我其实在想，哦，我真的需要被录用吗？
[00:08:12.650] It just feels like I am sitting here doing nothing.
[00:08:12.650] 感觉自己只是坐在这里无所事事。
[00:08:16.270] Maybe sometimes I get work and then I provide my draft or whatever.
[00:08:16.270] 有时候我可能会接到工作，然后我会提供我的草稿之类的。
[00:08:21.110] And then my manager couldn't quite express what they wanted changed.
[00:08:21.110] 然后我的经理又说不清楚他们想要改变什么。
[00:08:26.450] So instead, they just redid the whole thing on their own.
[00:08:26.450] 所以，他们干脆自己把整个项目重新做了一遍。
[00:08:30.310] Oh, my God.
[00:08:30.310] 我的天啊。
[00:08:31.170] From there, you know, you don't learn.
[00:08:31.170] 从那以后，你就学不到任何东西了。
[00:08:32.670] You don't know why it had to be redone.
[00:08:32.670] 你不知道为什么需要重做。
[00:08:34.910] You don't know what you should do differently next time.
[00:08:34.910] 你不知道下次应该如何改进。
[00:08:37.650] It's also frustrating because then you're like, oh, well, which project will get accepted and like which one is just going to get like quietly redone with no explanation.
[00:08:37.650] 这也很令人沮丧，因为你会想，哦，好吧，哪个项目会被接受，哪个项目又会被悄悄地重做，而且没有任何解释。
[00:08:47.150] So it was like a very interesting situation.
[00:08:47.150] 所以，这真是一个非常有趣的情况。
[00:08:50.070] That is interesting.
[00:08:50.070] 这很有意思。
[00:08:51.210] I feel like one being so green in your career, you want to be utilized as much as possible and learning and absorbing as much as possible.
[00:08:51.210] 我觉得，对于一个职场新人来说，你会想要尽可能地发挥自己的才能，尽可能地学习和吸收知识。
[00:08:59.490] So I can see how the lack of feedback and structure is so dampening in terms of like, oh, I'm a brand new 22 year old.
[00:08:59.490] 所以我能理解，缺乏反馈和结构会如何打击年轻人的积极性，比如，哦，我是一个刚满 22 岁的年轻人。
[00:09:07.450] I just want to learn everything.
[00:09:07.450] 我只想学习一切。
[00:09:08.850] It's interesting because I feel like what I've learned from a not bad boss, but probably more of like an incompatible boss was almost the opposite.
[00:09:08.850] 这很有意思，因为我觉得我从一位不算坏的老板（但可能更像是一位不合适的老板）身上学到的东西，几乎与我从一位不太好的老板身上学到的东西完全相反。
[00:09:18.910] So I have had bosses that are a little bit more helicoptery where they are constantly nitpicking on certain things or unable to like release you to be independent.
[00:09:18.910] 我遇到过一些喜欢过度干预的老板，他们总是对某些事情吹毛求疵，或者不肯放手让你独立工作。
[00:09:35.090] Kind of.
[00:09:35.090] 有点儿。
[00:09:35.690] I think it was just an interesting contrast because one of the bosses that I've had a little bit more early on in my career was really someone who helped me be more independent in the workplace.
[00:09:35.690] 我觉得这只是一个有趣的对比，因为我职业生涯早期遇到的一位老板，确实帮助我在工作中变得更加独立。
[00:09:46.930] Someone who had full trust in me and would back me up when I needed it.
[00:09:46.930] 一个完全信任我，并在我需要时支持我的人。
[00:09:51.330] But if he thought I would be fine, then he would just let me run big meetings, speak to really big higher ups, etc.
[00:09:51.330] 但如果他认为我能胜任，那么他就会让我主持大型会议，与高层领导交谈等等。
[00:09:57.850] So I felt like I gained so much confidence as well as just like these things that you pick up from communicating with leadership and whatnot.
[00:09:57.850] 所以我觉得我获得了很大的自信，也学到了很多与领导沟通等方面的知识。
[00:10:08.290] So I just felt very important and also useful.
[00:10:08.290] 所以我觉得自己非常重要，也很有用。
[00:10:12.110] Yeah.
[00:10:12.110] 是的。
[00:10:13.090] So in contrast, this other boss who was nitpicking a little bit more on like stylistic stuff and just had a lot of structure that I think benefited this boss, but maybe not so much me.
[00:10:13.090] 相比之下，另一位老板则更注重风格方面的细节，而且结构非常严谨，我认为这对这位老板有利，但可能对我来说不太有利。
[00:10:26.290] I was just kind of like, whoa, this is like a really big change.
[00:10:26.290] 我当时就想，哇，这变化也太大了。
[00:10:29.610] So I think it's always interesting to see what that sweet spot is in terms of what your personal needs are.
[00:10:29.610] 所以我觉得，找到个人需求的最佳平衡点总是很有趣的。
[00:10:34.950] And then trying to find that compromising middle ground with what your boss needs, because everyone has different preferences and whatnot.
[00:10:34.950] 然后努力找到既能满足老板需求又能兼顾各方利益的折中方案，因为每个人都有不同的喜好等等。
[00:10:41.870] But I think at the end of the day, it needs to be benefiting both of you and not just one person.
[00:10:41.870] 但我认为归根结底，这件事应该对你们双方都有利，而不仅仅是对一方有利。
[00:10:48.230] Definitely.
[00:10:48.230] 确实。
[00:10:48.550] I think it's very interesting, too, because in my example, because I felt so stagnant, I started to try to find ways that I could be helpful to the company in other areas or how I could insert my skills somehow.
[00:10:48.550] 我觉得这很有意思，因为在我的例子中，由于我感到停滞不前，我开始尝试寻找我可以在公司其他领域提供帮助的方法，或者如何以某种方式发挥我的技能。
[00:11:04.850] And so it's kind of funny because I ended up bonding with this other person in the company and basically working for them for maybe like 30 percent of my work.
[00:11:04.850] 所以这事儿挺搞笑的，因为我最后和公司里的另一个人建立了良好的关系，基本上我大约 30% 的工作都是为他/她做的。
[00:11:18.490] I also kind of like forced my way into creating some projects that my manager wasn't capable of creating.
[00:11:18.490] 我也算是强行参与创建了一些我的经理无法创建的项目。
[00:11:26.250] I ended up having to like almost make a role for myself and like, you know, find myself another pseudo manager.
[00:11:26.250] 最后我不得不几乎是给自己创造一个角色，然后，你知道的，找另一个类似经理的人来管理自己。
[00:11:33.850] But as things were kind of starting to settle, I found a new job.
[00:11:33.850] 但就在一切逐渐稳定下来的时候，我找到了一份新工作。
[00:11:38.230] And then my manager was like, oh, like, is there any way we can keep you at this company?
[00:11:38.230] 然后我的经理就说，哦，我们有没有办法让你留在公司？
[00:11:43.650] And in my mind, I was just like, no, no, because I had to work so hard just to carve out these roles.
[00:11:43.650] 我当时心里想的是，不，不，因为我必须付出很多努力才能获得这些角色。
[00:11:52.690] But I still don't feel like I have a mentor figure or someone who I could be, you know, gaining more insight from.
[00:11:52.690] 但我仍然感觉自己没有导师，或者说，没有可以从中获得更多启发的人。
[00:12:01.150] And this new opportunity would provide that.
[00:12:01.150] 而这个新机遇将提供这样的机会。
[00:12:04.190] And so it was kind of a choice between working through ambiguity, but maybe more ambiguity than what's typical versus going to a place with more structure and learning from that first before I enter.
[00:12:04.190] 所以，这其实是一个选择：要么在充满不确定性的环境中工作，但这种不确定性可能比一般情况更大；要么先去一个结构更清晰的地方学习，然后再进入那里。
[00:12:18.030] If I ever wanted to another company that has less structure and more ambiguity.
[00:12:18.030] 如果我以后想去另一家结构更松散、更模糊的公司的话。
[00:12:24.810] I like that this is like a two-pronged lesson then for you.
[00:12:24.810] 我觉得这对你来说就像是一个双管齐下的教训。
[00:12:28.010] One, knowing what to do if you're not feeling fulfilled at work and not getting handed projects that you need.
[00:12:28.010] 第一，要知道如果你在工作中没有成就感，也没有得到你需要的项目，该怎么办。
[00:12:34.590] And also to just knowing when to leave, drawing the boundary of when enough is enough.
[00:12:34.590] 而且还要知道何时该离开，划清界限，何时该止步。
[00:12:38.850] Yeah, it was a little scary because I don't know if this is still the narrative, but I remember when we were getting out of college, the narrative was always try to stay at a job for at least a year.
[00:12:38.850] 是的，这有点吓人，因为我不知道现在是不是还是这样，但我记得我们大学毕业的时候，大家总是说要尽量在一份工作上待至少一年。
[00:12:50.590] Right.
[00:12:50.590] 正确的。
[00:12:51.150] Ideally, maybe like a year and a half or two years so that you could get a promo.
[00:12:51.150] 理想情况下，也许需要一年半到两年的时间，这样你才能获得晋升。
[00:12:55.310] And then if you want to like hop around, go ahead.
[00:12:55.310] 然后，如果你想到处蹦蹦跳跳，那就去吧。
[00:12:59.010] And I ended up leaving before 12 months.
[00:12:59.010] 结果我不到12个月就离开了。
[00:13:02.870] I think it was actually like only eight months before I left.
[00:13:02.870] 我记得好像只过了八个月我就离开了。
[00:13:06.510] So I was kind of like, oh, I don't know.
[00:13:06.510] 所以我就想，哦，我不知道。
[00:13:08.630] This is like maybe a little risky.
[00:13:08.630] 这可能有点冒险。
[00:13:10.250] I don't know if I'll get jobs.
[00:13:10.250] 我不知道我能不能找到工作。
[00:13:11.530] I don't know if the new job will pan out.
[00:13:11.530] 我不知道这份新工作能否成功。
[00:13:13.530] All that kind of stuff.
[00:13:13.530] 诸如此类的事情。
[00:13:14.510] But it ended up okay.
[00:13:14.510] 但最终结果还算不错。
[00:13:16.270] So it all worked out.
[00:13:16.270] 所以一切都圆满解决了。
[00:13:18.750] I mean, I feel like at the end of the day, there's going to be people who are more strict about that kind of, you know, one to two years rule.
[00:13:18.750] 我的意思是，我觉得最终还是会有人对那种一到两年的规则更加严格。
[00:13:25.130] But if you're able to explain why or address it promptly without having to go into the details, I feel like it's fine.
[00:13:25.130] 但如果你能解释原因或及时解决问题，而无需赘述细节，我觉得就没问题。
[00:13:32.350] As long as you don't have like a pattern of like leaving every six months, I feel like it's also okay.
[00:13:32.350] 只要你不是每六个月就离开一次，我觉得也没问题。
[00:13:37.490] True.
[00:13:37.490] 真的。
[00:13:37.970] So how about those times when you had a really good boss?
[00:13:37.970] 那么，你遇到过非常好的老板吗？
[00:13:42.010] Were there any tips or lessons that you learned from them?
[00:13:42.010] 你从他们身上学到了什么经验或教训吗？
[00:13:46.150] Yeah.
[00:13:46.150] 是的。
[00:13:46.490] So one of the tips that I learned was kind of like an analyst staple and it's called the sniff test.
[00:13:46.490] 所以我学到的一个技巧，可以说是分析师的必备技能，叫做“嗅觉测试”。
[00:13:54.710] I feel like it sounds a little bit nasty because the word sniff is like slightly gross to me.
[00:13:54.710] 我觉得这样说有点恶心，因为“闻”这个词对我来说有点令人反感。
[00:13:59.970] But basically what it means is as an analyst or a numbers person, you are often doing things like projections.
[00:13:59.970] 但从根本上来说，这意味着作为一名分析师或数字工作者，你经常会做一些预测之类的事情。
[00:14:07.970] And when you project something, you want to make sure that it makes sense and passes like basic checkpoints before you start sharing these numbers out to people.
[00:14:07.970] 当你预测某些东西时，你需要确保它有意义，并且通过了基本的检查点，然后再开始与人们分享这些数据。
[00:14:18.170] That's essentially what the sniff test is.
[00:14:18.170] 这就是嗅觉测试的本质。
[00:14:20.570] Does it make sense?
[00:14:20.570] 这说得通吗？
[00:14:21.650] And I think it sounds kind of stupid because it's like, yeah, of course you want your project to make sense.
[00:14:21.650] 我觉得这听起来有点蠢，因为，是啊，你当然希望你的项目有意义。
[00:14:26.170] But when you're actually deep into the weeds, crunching numbers, looking at things that are sometimes like really big data sets, you are looking at each step making sense.
[00:14:26.170] 但当你真正深入细节，处理数据，查看有时像非常大的数据集一样的东西时，你会考虑每一步是否有意义。
[00:14:35.650] But when you come to the final product, which is like whatever your projection is, you also want to make sure that it fits into the big picture bold.
[00:14:35.650] 但是，当你最终做出成品时，就像你的任何设想一样，你也需要确保它符合宏观的大局。
[00:14:43.530] So the sniff test is very important to be able to take a step back after you're done spending however long you have spent looking at the data and making sure that it all fits into this big narrative.
[00:14:43.530] 因此，仔细审视数据非常重要，这样在你花费大量时间查看数据并确保所有数据都符合这个大叙事之后，可以退后一步进行审视。
[00:14:55.650] And I think part of what my job is, is very much like storytelling.
[00:14:55.650] 我认为我的工作的一部分，很像讲故事。
[00:14:59.650] I think with whatever data set, you can pull out bits and pieces and kind of like cherry pick info as you want to.
[00:14:59.650] 我认为，无论使用什么数据集，你都可以提取其中的一些部分，并根据需要挑选信息。
[00:15:06.650] But the number itself is significantly less important than the actual story that you're trying to tell and prove.
[00:15:06.650] 但数字本身远不如你想要讲述和证明的故事重要。
[00:15:14.610] So the sniff test is something that I actually think about like every day.
[00:15:14.610] 所以，嗅觉测试其实是我几乎每天都会想到的事情。
[00:15:19.430] That makes sense.
[00:15:19.430] 这很有道理。
[00:15:20.810] And immediately what I thought of was you don't want someone in the meeting to be like, something smells fishy about this.
[00:15:20.810] 我当时立刻想到的是，你肯定不希望会议上有人觉得“这事儿有点蹊跷”。
[00:15:31.130] Exactly.
[00:15:31.130] 确切地。
[00:15:32.670] But yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:32.670] 没错，这很有道理。
[00:15:34.570] I think I have something similar, you know, if you're editing a video or like creating some graphic, you want to like take a break and then look at it the next day with fresh eyes, essentially, so that you're looking at the big picture again.
[00:15:34.570] 我觉得我的情况也类似，你知道，如果你在剪辑视频或者制作一些图形，你可能需要休息一下，然后第二天用全新的视角再看一遍，这样你才能重新审视全局。
[00:15:49.230] So very similar to what you're saying.
[00:15:49.230] 跟你说的非常相似。
[00:15:52.330] Yeah.
[00:15:52.330] 是的。
[00:15:52.790] The funny thing, too, is like doing the sniff test is sometimes very high level.
[00:15:52.790] 有趣的是，有时候进行嗅觉测试的水平非常高。
[00:15:58.670] You're just like, oh, yeah, this number seems to make sense to answer this question.
[00:15:58.670] 你会想，哦，是的，这个数字似乎可以回答这个问题。
[00:16:01.770] But other times you're actually going in and looking at other KPI to see if this projection makes sense relative to each KPI.
[00:16:01.770] 但有时你实际上需要深入研究其他 KPI，看看这个预测相对于每个 KPI 是否合理。
[00:16:12.150] So then when you do that, you're also walking through questions that other people might have.
[00:16:12.150] 所以当你这样做的时候，你也同时解答了其他人可能会提出的问题。
[00:16:18.470] So then you're preemptively coming up with answers to those questions, too.
[00:16:18.470] 所以你也是在提前想出这些问题的答案。
[00:16:23.030] Like, yeah, I know this relative to this other metric might seem a little strange, but it actually makes sense because X, Y and Z.
[00:16:23.030] 是的，我知道相对于其他指标来说，这可能看起来有点奇怪，但实际上是有道理的，因为 X、Y 和 Z。
[00:16:29.370] Like you're doing all that prep work, too.
[00:16:29.370] 就像你也做了所有这些准备工作一样。
[00:16:31.430] So sniff test in general, I feel like is very, very useful.
[00:16:31.430] 所以我觉得嗅觉测试总体来说非常非常有用。
[00:16:35.010] Do you ever sniff test with fellow employees?
[00:16:35.010] 你有没有和同事进行过气味测试？
[00:16:39.370] Actually, yes.
[00:16:39.370] 实际上，是的。
[00:16:40.830] I've done this with reports as well as with projections.
[00:16:40.830] 我用这种方法处理过报告和预测数据。
[00:16:44.710] So like, oh, I ran this number.
[00:16:44.710] 所以，哦，我算了一下这个数字。
[00:16:46.390] Can you guys take a look and see if it makes sense?
[00:16:46.390] 你们能看一下，看看是否合理吗？
[00:16:48.990] The other thing could be like, OK, I spent like five days working on this report.
[00:16:48.990] 另一种情况可能是，好吧，我花了五天时间写这份报告。
[00:16:54.630] Can you like double check all the formulas and whatnot?
[00:16:54.630] 你能再检查一下所有的公式之类的吗？
[00:16:58.010] Sniff testing with other people is highly recommended as well.
[00:16:58.010] 同时强烈建议与其他人的嗅觉测试进行对比。
[00:17:03.550] Nice.
[00:17:03.550] 好的。
[00:17:04.510] I guess speaking of other people, I think another tip that I learned is it's OK to ask other people for help.
[00:17:04.510] 我想说的是，关于其他人，我学到的另一个技巧是，向其他人寻求帮助是可以的。
[00:17:11.810] And I think this one's a little bit cliche.
[00:17:11.810] 我觉得这个有点老套。
[00:17:14.630] You know, it's applicable to like work and real life and everything.
[00:17:14.630] 你知道，这适用于工作、现实生活以及所有方面。
[00:17:18.070] But I think it is a lesson that I'm constantly reminded of, especially when you have a good team surrounding you, people that you feel comfortable with, that you're confident in their work, that kind of stuff.
[00:17:18.070] 但我认为这是一个我经常被提醒的教训，尤其是当你身边有一个优秀的团队，一群让你感到自在、对他们的工作充满信心的人时，诸如此类的事情。
[00:17:32.110] It is really helpful to ask someone to even just like sit down and brainstorm with you or put a second pair of eyes on the work that you've done.
[00:17:32.110] 邀请别人坐下来和你一起集思广益，或者帮你审阅一下你已经完成的工作，真的很有帮助。
[00:17:41.810] Or sometimes even to just really help out like, hey, can you do this portion of the project?
[00:17:41.810] 或者有时候甚至只是想帮帮忙，比如，“嘿，你能做一下项目的这部分吗？”
[00:17:47.290] And I'll do like this portion of the project that I'm stronger at and that portion that you're stronger at.
[00:17:47.290] 我会负责我更擅长的那部分项目，以及你更擅长的那部分项目。
[00:17:52.490] I'm going to be honest.
[00:17:52.490] 我实话实说。
[00:17:53.510] I'm still not like the best at this, but I definitely try to keep it in mind.
[00:17:53.510] 我在这方面仍然做得不够好，但我一定会牢记在心。
[00:17:58.310] And I think in each job that I'm in, as I build a stronger rapport with my teammates, it starts to feel easier to approach them for like maybe smaller favors at first and then like more bigger collaborative efforts.
[00:17:58.310] 我认为，在我从事的每份工作中，随着我与团队成员建立起更牢固的融洽关系，我会更容易地向他们寻求帮助，一开始可能是一些小事，然后是更大的合作项目。
[00:18:13.350] Dude, I feel like this one, I mean, you mentioned that it might be a cliche, but I actually feel like this is a skill.
[00:18:13.350] 兄弟，我觉得这个，我的意思是，你也提到过这可能有点老套，但我真的觉得这是一种技巧。
[00:18:19.390] I say that specifically because it's often kind of shared as like, oh, you know, this is advice, like do this tip or whatever.
[00:18:19.390] 我特意这么说，是因为它经常被当作建议来分享，比如，“你知道，这是个小技巧，试试这个方法”之类的。
[00:18:26.830] But I think you actually have to like work and develop how to ask people for help because you kind of have to carve out like specific points that you need help on, which in itself can be kind of difficult sometimes.
[00:18:26.830] 但我认为你实际上必须喜欢工作，并且学会如何向别人寻求帮助，因为你必须明确指出你需要帮助的具体方面，而这本身有时可能相当困难。
[00:18:40.790] And then you are mapping it to people who you think could help you best, finding the right timing to do it, seeing how you want to lay out the info or project or whatever to be able to ask for help.
[00:18:40.790] 然后，你要找到最能帮助你的人，找到合适的时机，考虑如何安排信息、项目或其他任何内容，以便能够寻求帮助。
[00:18:52.470] So this is something that I need a lot of work on as well.
[00:18:52.470] 所以，这方面我也需要多加努力。
[00:18:56.150] And I think the more you do it and the more you practice it, it gets slightly easier.
[00:18:56.150] 我觉得你做得越多，练习得越多，就会变得稍微容易一些。
[00:19:01.130] That's true, because depending on your career path, you could be like a individual contributor for a while if you don't want to become a manager or maybe the nature of your job is more like individual contributor-esque.
[00:19:01.130] 没错，因为根据你的职业发展道路，如果你不想成为经理，或者你的工作性质更类似于个人贡献者，那么你可能会有一段时间像个人贡献者一样工作。
[00:19:15.590] So if you're not in a manager position, it's almost weird to like try and delegate.
[00:19:15.590] 所以，如果你不是管理者，尝试去委派任务就显得有点奇怪了。
[00:19:22.030] Right.
[00:19:22.030] 正确的。
[00:19:22.870] And I feel like in my perspective, it almost forces you to like write out a project plan and be more of a project manager in that moment.
[00:19:22.870] 我觉得，从我的角度来看，这几乎迫使你在那一刻制定项目计划，并扮演项目经理的角色。
[00:19:33.830] And that might be a little different from the way you normally operate.
[00:19:33.830] 这可能与你通常的操作方式略有不同。
[00:19:37.830] For example, I don't really write myself project plans.
[00:19:37.830] 例如，我一般不给自己写项目计划。
[00:19:40.590] It's just kind of like a general checklist versus some other people, if you're asking for their help, might want to see the bigger picture laid out as well as the more minute details that they're helping with so that it all makes sense for them and that they know they're not wasting their time.
[00:19:40.590] 这就像一份通用的清单，而有些人，如果你向他们寻求帮助，他们可能希望看到整体情况以及他们正在协助处理的更细致的细节，这样他们才能理解事情的来龙去脉，并且知道自己没有浪费时间。
[00:19:56.430] Mm-hmm.
[00:19:56.430] 嗯。
[00:19:57.610] And you also have to practice the way to ask someone for help in a way that makes them want to help you.
[00:19:57.610] 你还需要练习如何向别人寻求帮助，才能让他们乐意帮助你。
[00:20:03.730] Oh, so true.
[00:20:03.730] 哦，说得太对了。
[00:20:04.570] I think by default, most people are willing and happy to help you, but people don't always have enough bandwidth or they might see your request and be like, oh, this is a lot.
[00:20:04.570] 我认为，大多数人默认情况下都愿意并且乐于助人，但人们并不总是有足够的精力，或者他们看到你的请求后可能会想，哦，这太多了。
[00:20:14.010] So you kind of have to ask it at like the right timing in the perfect way with everything packaged neatly.
[00:20:14.010] 所以你必须在合适的时机，用合适的方式，把所有事情都安排妥当，才能问出这个问题。
[00:20:20.750] Absolutely.
[00:20:20.750] 绝对地。
[00:20:21.190] So this actually leads me to a different tip that I learned from a boss who I learned a lot of things from a very short period of time because this person had a lot of particular ways to kind of do their work in a way that is most effective, essentially.
[00:20:21.190] 这实际上让我想到了我从一位老板那里学到的另一个技巧，我在很短的时间内从他身上学到了很多东西，因为这个人有很多独特的工作方法，本质上来说，这些方法是最有效的。
[00:20:37.010] And this tip that I picked up was the CEO tip.
[00:20:37.010] 而我学到的这条秘诀，正是CEO的秘诀。
[00:20:41.130] The essence of the tip is you want your work to be ready to be read by like a CEO.
[00:20:41.130] 这条建议的精髓在于，你要让你的作品能够被像CEO一样的人阅读。
[00:20:46.770] And as it is frequently known, CEOs don't have much time.
[00:20:46.770] 众所周知，CEO们的时间并不多。
[00:20:50.350] So that basically means your work needs to be very clear, easy to read.
[00:20:50.350] 所以基本上来说，你的作品需要非常清晰易懂。
[00:20:54.670] And also the report itself needs to be easy to navigate.
[00:20:54.670] 此外，报告本身也需要易于浏览。
[00:20:58.250] So if you're working on like BI software where the data is already kind of easy to read and navigate, this might not apply to you as much.
[00:20:58.250] 因此，如果您正在使用 BI 软件，而软件中的数据本身就很容易阅读和浏览，那么这可能对您不太适用。
[00:21:07.210] But if you're like a very Excel heavy numbers person, Excel needs to be like manually kind of formatted so that it's pretty and easy to read.
[00:21:07.210] 但如果你经常使用 Excel 处理大量数字，那么 Excel 就需要手动进行格式化，使其美观且易于阅读。
[00:21:16.450] And one of the things that this boss taught me was to always put your mouse cursor on cell A1.
[00:21:16.450] 这位老板教我的其中一件事就是始终将鼠标光标放在 A1 单元格上。
[00:21:25.330] So the topmost and leftmost cell for each sheet, go back to the tab you want the report to open it and then save in that way.
[00:21:25.330] 因此，在每个工作表的最上、最左边的单元格中，返回到要打开报告的选项卡，然后以这种方式保存。
[00:21:34.370] And it sounds very particular and kind of strange, but it makes a ton of sense because when someone goes and opens an Excel sheet, it will automatically open at the tab that it was saved on.
[00:21:34.370] 这听起来很特别，也有点奇怪，但其实很有道理，因为当有人打开一个 Excel 表格时，它会自动打开到保存该表格的标签页。
[00:21:47.890] When you click through different tabs, if you left your cell cursor on like the bottom most cell or like all the way on the right or something like that and saved it that way, it'll always open that tab in that same way.
[00:21:47.890] 当您点击不同的标签页时，如果您将单元格光标停留在最底部的单元格或最右侧的单元格等位置并保存，则该标签页将始终以相同的方式打开。
[00:22:01.630] So by putting your cursor in cell A1 on everything, you're basically like reorienting the spreadsheet to look exactly how you were intending it to look.
[00:22:01.630] 所以，通过将光标放在 A1 单元格中，你实际上就是在重新调整电子表格的方向，使其看起来完全符合你的预期。
[00:22:12.190] It just saves a couple seconds of people's time but makes a world of a difference in terms of professionalism, how it looks, how it can be read, etc.
[00:22:12.190] 虽然只节省了人们几秒钟的时间，但在专业性、外观、可读性等方面却能带来巨大的改变。
[00:22:22.190] So when I first heard this, I was like, damn, that's a little strange.
[00:22:22.190] 所以当我第一次听到这件事的时候，我就想，该死，这有点奇怪。
[00:22:26.630] But the more I started doing it, I was like, well, this actually doesn't take me that much time and it's very easy to do and saves other people time.
[00:22:26.630] 但是我越做越觉得，其实这并不会占用我太多时间，而且做起来非常容易，还能节省其他人的时间。
[00:22:35.330] So I still try to do this to this day, especially when I send out like reports and stuff.
[00:22:35.330] 所以直到今天我仍然尽量这样做，尤其是在发送报告之类的东西时。
[00:22:40.030] Honestly, that's a really good tip because sometimes I open random Google Sheets and it's just open on like some random tab.
[00:22:40.030] 说实话，这真是个好建议，因为有时候我打开随机的 Google 表格，它会随机打开在某个标签页里。
[00:22:50.090] I'm like, oh my God, where's the info I'm looking for?
[00:22:50.090] 我当时就想，我的天哪，我要找的信息在哪里？
[00:22:53.090] And then I have to like scroll through all the tabs and like figure out what's going on.
[00:22:53.090] 然后我就得把所有标签页都翻一遍，弄清楚到底发生了什么。
[00:22:57.090] But yeah, if it were to just land exactly on the tab that I wanted, it would be so much more helpful because you're right.
[00:22:57.090] 没错，如果它能直接跳转到我想要的标签页，那就方便多了，你说得对。
[00:23:05.330] It does save a lot of time.
[00:23:05.330] 确实能节省很多时间。
[00:23:06.510] And sometimes it's not even just a couple seconds.
[00:23:06.510] 有时甚至连几秒钟都不够。
[00:23:09.330] Maybe it's like a whole minute or two where they're figuring out the data sheet as a whole.
[00:23:09.330] 也许他们花了一两分钟的时间来理解整个数据表。
[00:23:13.970] And then they can be like, oh, OK, like this is where I need to be.
[00:23:13.970] 然后他们可能会想，哦，好吧，这就是我应该来的地方。
[00:23:18.690] This is where it connects.
[00:23:18.690] 这就是它们的连接点。
[00:23:20.090] I've also seen some people get really creative and they have like maybe the first tab just set as instructions, like how to use this data sheet.
[00:23:20.090] 我还见过一些人很有创意，他们可能会把第一个标签页设置为说明，比如如何使用这个数据表。
[00:23:30.190] Go to like this tab to do this and like that connects to this tab.
[00:23:30.190] 转到类似这样的选项卡来执行此操作，而那个选项卡则连接到此选项卡。
[00:23:33.570] Of course, that's like much more complicated and might take a lot of time.
[00:23:33.570] 当然，那要复杂得多，而且可能需要花费大量时间。
[00:23:38.070] But I do think it's also kind of good practice just to like exercise documentation.
[00:23:38.070] 但我认为，养成记录练习的习惯也是一种很好的做法。
[00:23:44.370] And I don't know about you, but I feel like that's a huge word in like work.
[00:23:44.370] 我不知道你怎么想，但我感觉这在工作中是一个非常重要的词。
[00:23:49.510] It's always like don't forget to like document what you've been doing and like templatize it for the future.
[00:23:49.510] 总是要记得记录你一直在做的事情，并将其制成模板以备将来使用。
[00:23:55.050] Like all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:55.050] 诸如此类的事情。
[00:23:57.810] Yeah, I feel like it's kind of funny that you say that because with every boss that I've had, the way their templates work and like the way their spreadsheets are structured are very different.
[00:23:57.810] 是啊，我觉得你说的挺有意思的，因为我遇到的每个老板，他们的模板使用方式和电子表格的结构都非常不同。
[00:24:08.590] And then I feel like when you work under a boss, you start to just like morph into that kind of person.
[00:24:08.590] 然后我觉得，当你为某个老板工作时，你就会开始慢慢变成那样的人。
[00:24:14.130] So I really like the way my crit boss templatizes her work and being under this boss for a little bit.
[00:24:14.130] 所以我真的很喜欢我的暴击型 Boss 的模板化工作方式，也很喜欢在这个 Boss 手下待一段时间。
[00:24:21.210] It's like second nature to me now, but it is interesting kind of looking back at the spreadsheets of my various former bosses and see how it differs.
[00:24:21.210] 现在这对我来说就像是本能一样，但回顾我以前各个老板的电子表格，看看它们有何不同，还是很有意思的。
[00:24:29.970] The evolution of your templates.
[00:24:29.970] 模板的演变。
[00:24:32.310] Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:32.310] 对，没错。
[00:24:34.190] I thought of another tip that I've learned, but it's not necessarily related to what we've talked about.
[00:24:34.190] 我想起了另一个我学到的技巧，但它和我们刚才讨论的内容不一定有关。
[00:24:39.990] I think maybe you can relate where somewhere inside me there is a perfectionist and that perfectionist wants to do everything to 110%.
[00:24:39.990] 我想你或许能感同身受，我内心深处有一个完美主义者，这个完美主义者想要把每件事都做到110%。
[00:24:52.770] Everything must be perfect.
[00:24:52.770] 一切都必须完美。
[00:24:55.410] The ideal is you turn in this project and everyone's just like, wow, perfect.
[00:24:55.410] 理想的情况是，你交出这个项目后，每个人都会说，哇，完美！
[00:25:00.510] No notes.
[00:25:00.510] 没有备注。
[00:25:01.530] On to the next.
[00:25:01.530] 下一个。
[00:25:02.670] Right.
[00:25:02.670] 正确的。
[00:25:02.850] And I think that can often lead to like procrastination too, because you're stuck thinking, what do I need to do to make this perfect?
[00:25:02.850] 我认为这往往也会导致拖延，因为你会一直想着，我需要做什么才能把这件事做到完美？
[00:25:11.670] So there was this one time my manager at the time told me just straight up, she was like, Crystal, I think your 80% is already plenty.
[00:25:11.670] 有一次，我当时的经理直接跟我说：“Crystal，我觉得你80%的完成率已经足够了。”
[00:25:24.210] It is more than enough for everyone else.
[00:25:24.210] 对其他人来说绰绰有余了。
[00:25:27.150] And I was like, oh, that might be true.
[00:25:27.150] 我当时想，哦，这也许是真的。
[00:25:30.950] Because there's a reason why you're in your job, right?
[00:25:30.950] 你从事这份工作肯定是有原因的，对吧？
[00:25:33.970] And it's because that you're an expert at it.
[00:25:33.970] 那是因为你是这方面的专家。
[00:25:36.550] And that means the people around you are not always experts at it.
[00:25:36.550] 这意味着你身边的人并不总是这方面的专家。
[00:25:39.970] So if you just like trust in your expertise and bring forth good work, that's usually enough.
[00:25:39.970] 所以，如果你相信自己的专业能力并拿出好的作品，通常就足够了。
[00:25:46.650] And then it saves you a lot of time from like nitpicking at yourself into making these like probably good, but like extremely minor and like niche adjustments that maybe no one else would even notice.
[00:25:46.650] 这样可以节省你很多时间，避免你吹毛求疵地进行一些可能不错但非常细微且小众的调整，这些调整可能根本没人会注意到。
[00:25:59.370] Like I'm moving like these things pixels over and I'm like, oh, yes, it is perfect now.
[00:25:59.370] 就像我移动这些东西时，像素一点一点地移动，然后我就想，哦，是的，现在完美了。
[00:26:04.470] But literally everyone else is like, there's no difference.
[00:26:04.470] 但其他人都觉得，根本没区别。
[00:26:08.610] It looks good to me.
[00:26:08.610] 我觉得挺好的。
[00:26:12.490] So I think it was a really good tip and reminder that sometimes it really is worth it to save that extra 20% of effort for another project or for handling feedback or whatever.
[00:26:12.490] 所以我认为这是一个很好的建议和提醒，有时候真的值得把额外的 20% 精力留给其他项目、处理反馈或其他事情。
[00:26:27.070] And maybe, you know, in that moment, the more important part is to get the project out.
[00:26:27.070] 或许，你知道，在那一刻，更重要的是把项目完成。
[00:26:31.950] Dude, this is such a good tip.
[00:26:31.950] 老兄，这真是个好建议。
[00:26:34.050] And it's something that I grapple with as well.
[00:26:34.050] 这也是我一直在努力思考的问题。
[00:26:37.170] We obviously work in like slightly different fields of work, but I feel like any time you put out a project, at least for me, I am like, damn, what's the kind of feedback that I'm going to get back?
[00:26:37.170] 我们显然从事着略有不同的工作领域，但我觉得无论你何时发布一个项目，至少对我来说，我都会想，天哪，我会收到什么样的反馈？
[00:26:47.970] I feel like I'm always trying to think about that and then make tweaks to my numbers or my methodology or whatever to get to the perfect number so that no one could ask any questions about it.
[00:26:47.970] 我觉得我总是在思考这个问题，然后不断调整我的数字、方法或其他方面，以达到完美的数字，这样就不会有人对此提出任何疑问了。
[00:27:00.290] But it's like that obviously doesn't exist.
[00:27:00.290] 但显然，这种情况并不存在。
[00:27:02.270] And the important part is not to not get any questions about it, but to be able to like clearly explain the work and the reasoning.
[00:27:02.270] 重要的是，不是不被问到相关问题，而是能够清楚地解释工作内容和推理过程。
[00:27:09.650] If tweaks need to be made, you just make tweaks.
[00:27:09.650] 如果需要进行调整，那就进行调整。
[00:27:12.690] But I feel like I'm so scared of that like potential feedback sometimes that I like spend so much time honing over my work, which ends up just being unproductive in the long run.
[00:27:12.690] 但我有时感觉自己非常害怕潜在的反馈，以至于花费大量时间打磨我的作品，从长远来看，这最终反而会适得其反。
[00:27:23.150] Could have just pushed it out, gotten feedback, tweaked it, and then we would have been done like two days ago.
[00:27:23.150] 我们本来可以直接发布，收集反馈，进行调整，然后两天前就完成了。
[00:27:27.430] Yeah, so true, so true.
[00:27:27.430] 是啊，说得太对了，说得太对了。
[00:27:29.750] I still grapple with this for sure as well.
[00:27:29.750] 我也一直在努力思考这个问题。
[00:27:32.670] It's hard sometimes to let go of that perfectionism, especially when you don't even realize it's like you're just being a perfectionist.
[00:27:32.670] 有时候很难摆脱完美主义，尤其是当你自己都没有意识到自己正处于完美主义状态时。
[00:27:40.190] Right.
[00:27:40.190] 正确的。
[00:27:40.650] And I think it was like pretty eye-opening when my manager just told me straight up and I was like, oh my God, you're so right.
[00:27:40.650] 我觉得这真是让我大开眼界，我的经理直接跟我说了之后，我就想，哦我的天哪，你说得太对了。
[00:27:47.210] I'm spending hours here like changing these tiny pixels when I'm totally forgetting that the big picture already looks fine.
[00:27:47.210] 我花了几个小时在这里修改这些小像素，却完全忘记了整体效果已经很好了。
[00:27:55.230] I feel like I would hear this feedback and be like, so you're telling me my B- is an A-plus to you.
[00:27:55.230] 我觉得我听到这样的反馈会想，所以你的意思是，我的 B- 在你看来是 A+ 吗？
[00:28:03.490] But I think all of this goes to show that so much of what we do in a career standpoint is like relative to other people, which is something that I learned from one of my bosses as well.
[00:28:03.490] 但我认为这一切都表明，从职业角度来看，我们所做的很多事情都是相对于其他人而言的，这也是我从一位老板那里学到的。
[00:28:16.430] I feel like this point was hammered into me, but this is the lesson of know your audience.
[00:28:16.430] 我觉得这一点已经被反复强调过了，但这就是了解你的受众的重要性。
[00:28:21.830] As broad as this tip could be, I think in my field of work, it has very specific meaning, which means that anytime you are communicating to cross-functional partners, every cross-functional partner has a different goal that they're trying to hit, a different metric that they're measured by, different interests that all come together into this big like corporate pie.
[00:28:21.830] 尽管这条建议可能很宽泛，但我认为在我的工作领域，它有非常具体的含义，这意味着当你与跨职能合作伙伴沟通时，每个跨职能合作伙伴都有不同的目标要实现，不同的衡量标准，不同的利益，所有这些都汇聚成一个巨大的企业蛋糕。
[00:28:43.850] Even though I might just have one set of numbers to share to people, I am trying to convince these people that my number makes sense based on what metrics that they are looking for, essentially.
[00:28:43.850] 即使我可能只有一组数据可以与大家分享，但我本质上是在努力说服这些人，根据他们正在寻找的指标，我的数字是合理的。
[00:28:57.290] So simple terms, for example, I might be saying, guys, we need to set this product to cost $5.
[00:28:57.290] 简单来说，例如，我可能会说，伙计们，我们需要把这个产品的价格定为 5 美元。
[00:29:02.310] But there might be one team saying $5 isn't going to get us enough profit.
[00:29:02.310] 但可能有一支球队会说，5美元的利润不足以让我们获得足够的利润。
[00:29:06.870] We need to up the price.
[00:29:06.870] 我们需要提高价格。
[00:29:08.230] But the sales team might be like, oh, $5 is way too expensive.
[00:29:08.230] 但销售团队可能会想，哦，5 美元太贵了。
[00:29:11.810] No consumer is going to buy that.
[00:29:11.810] 没有消费者会买这种东西。
[00:29:13.630] So being able to convince different audiences that my number is legit and a way that makes sense to them and their goals, I think is something that I'm always working on.
[00:29:13.630] 所以，如何让不同的受众相信我的数字是真实的，并且符合他们的需求和目标，我认为这是我一直在努力的方向。
[00:29:25.850] Dude, this is why they made us write persuasive essays in school.
[00:29:25.850] 老兄，这就是为什么学校要我们写议论文的原因。
[00:29:29.910] So true, actually.
[00:29:29.910] 确实如此。
[00:29:31.830] Oh, my God.
[00:29:31.830] 我的天啊。
[00:29:33.210] And I think this goes to like other factions, too.
[00:29:33.210] 我认为这同样适用于其他派系。
[00:29:37.070] If you are a very technical person, but you're talking to people who are not technical or not doing these things on a daily basis, being able to kind of word things in a way that they would understand without all this like extensive back knowledge that you have.
[00:29:37.070] 如果你是一个非常懂技术的人，但你和不懂技术或者不经常做这些事情的人交谈，那么你需要用他们能够理解的方式来表达，而无需你拥有的所有丰富的背景知识。
[00:29:53.450] Or same thing when you're speaking to like executives.
[00:29:53.450] 或者当你和高管交谈时，情况也是如此。
[00:29:56.890] I am seeing like the daily nitty gritty on all of these things.
[00:29:56.890] 我每天都能看到所有这些事情的细节。
[00:30:00.710] But the executives are not just reading my emails.
[00:30:00.710] 但高管们不仅仅是在看我的邮件。
[00:30:03.170] They're also reading other people's emails.
[00:30:03.170] 他们还会偷看别人的电子邮件。
[00:30:05.150] They have a billion things going on through their brain.
[00:30:05.150] 他们的大脑里同时运转着无数的事情。
[00:30:07.770] So they might not remember things that to me, I'm like, I call this out like eight weeks in a row.
[00:30:07.770] 所以他们可能记不住一些事情，比如，我连续八周都提到过这些事情。
[00:30:12.290] So being able to kind of like cut through that noise in their brain and like jog their memory a little bit of like, oh, yeah.
[00:30:12.290] 所以，能够帮助他们理清思路，让他们想起一些事情，比如，哦，对了。
[00:30:19.170] Remember how I've been calling out this thing for two months?
[00:30:19.170] 还记得我两个月来一直在抨击这件事吗？
[00:30:22.290] It's the same issue now.
[00:30:22.290] 现在也是同样的问题。
[00:30:24.870] But wording it in like a polite way, I guess, is also part of the skill.
[00:30:24.870] 但我觉得，用礼貌的方式表达也是技巧的一部分。
[00:30:29.930] Right, right.
[00:30:29.930] 对，对。
[00:30:30.770] Yeah, I can totally see how this applies to any work with cross-functional teams.
[00:30:30.770] 是的，我完全明白这如何适用于任何跨职能团队的工作。
[00:30:36.530] I can even see how it could apply to like my position.
[00:30:36.530] 我甚至能看出它如何适用于像我这样的职位。
[00:30:39.690] Like you said, not everyone's going to know the nitty gritty of your job.
[00:30:39.690] 正如你所说，不是每个人都会了解你工作的细节。
[00:30:44.310] So sometimes people might ask me like, hey, I want like all this fancy stuff in this graphic or like video.
[00:30:44.310] 所以有时候人们可能会问我，嘿，我想要在这个图形或视频里加入所有这些花哨的东西。
[00:30:50.950] Is that possible?
[00:30:50.950] 这可能吗？
[00:30:52.150] And I'm just like, okay, low key, no.
[00:30:52.150] 我当时就想，好吧，低调地说，不。
[00:30:54.290] It's like not possible.
[00:30:54.290] 这几乎不可能。
[00:30:57.030] And they don't know that.
[00:30:57.030] 他们对此一无所知。
[00:30:58.410] So you have to like explain it to them and give them the rundown.
[00:30:58.410] 所以你得跟他们解释清楚，给他们讲讲情况。
[00:31:02.330] They're not going to sit there and like listen to you, give them a 30 minute lesson about like,
[00:31:02.330] 他们不会坐在那里听你讲课，也不会花30分钟给他们上一堂课，比如……
[00:31:06.890] so these are all the things that I've been doing.
[00:31:06.890] 以上就是我一直在做的事情。
[00:31:08.590] And this is why it's not possible.
[00:31:08.590] 这就是为什么这不可能的原因。
[00:31:10.310] You just kind of have to like give them it really basically like, oh, it's like not so possible because of this or like whatever.
[00:31:10.310] 你只需要很明确地告诉他们，比如，“哦，因为这个原因，这不太可能”或者诸如此类的事情。
[00:31:16.530] Yeah.
[00:31:16.530] 是的。
[00:31:16.910] And it kind of reminds me of this like corp speak thing that I feel like a lot of executives tend to say,
[00:31:16.910] 这让我想起很多高管经常说的一种企业术语，
[00:31:22.730] which is like, oh, I don't know what I don't know, you know?
[00:31:22.730] 这就好比，哦，我不知道我不知道什么，你知道吗？
[00:31:25.710] And it's like, I am not the biggest fan of this phrase.
[00:31:25.710] 而且，我其实不太喜欢这个说法。
[00:31:29.990] Like I feel like I'm always just like thinking of that drama.
[00:31:29.990] 我感觉自己总是忍不住去想那部剧。
[00:31:32.390] It's okay not to be okay.
[00:31:32.390] 感觉不好也没关系。
[00:31:34.830] But I think it is very true.
[00:31:34.830] 但我认为这非常正确。
[00:31:36.950] And sometimes when you're doing your own work in a silo, you're like, oh, how come no one else knows this shit?
[00:31:36.950] 有时候，当你独自埋头苦干的时候，你会想，为什么其他人都不知道这些？
[00:31:44.030] Like this is so obvious.
[00:31:44.030] 这明明很明显啊。
[00:31:44.910] But then you realize that all the other teams are working on their own things in a silo too.
[00:31:44.910] 但后来你意识到，其他所有团队也都在各自为政、孤立地开展自己的工作。
[00:31:50.610] So this is why kind of communication is key.
[00:31:50.610] 所以，沟通方式至关重要。
[00:31:53.590] For sure.
[00:31:53.590] 一定。
[00:31:54.610] And speaking of communication, I have also kind of learned low key at work.
[00:31:54.610] 说到沟通，我在工作中也学会了一些低调的沟通技巧。
[00:31:59.510] You just have to treat everyone like they're toddlers, not in a demeaning way or a diminishing way.
[00:31:59.510] 你只需要像对待幼儿一样对待每个人，不要以贬低或轻蔑的方式对待他们。
[00:32:06.170] But it's similar to what we've just been talking about.
[00:32:06.170] 但这和我们刚才讨论的内容很相似。
[00:32:09.010] Like not everyone's going to know the nitty gritty of your job.
[00:32:09.010] 并不是每个人都会了解你工作的细节。
[00:32:12.530] They're not going to know all the technical aspects.
[00:32:12.530] 他们不可能了解所有的技术细节。
[00:32:15.290] You pick a random person off the street.
[00:32:15.290] 你从街上随机挑选一个人。
[00:32:17.670] They're not going to know all the ins and outs of like Excel or Photoshop or whatever.
[00:32:17.670] 他们不可能了解Excel、Photoshop或其他软件的所有细节。
[00:32:22.490] Sometimes you just have to remember that you can't be too technical.
[00:32:22.490] 有时候你必须记住，不要过于技术化。
[00:32:26.590] And maybe you should try to explain things, you know, that like subreddit.
[00:32:26.590] 或许你应该试着解释一下，你知道，就像subreddit那样。
[00:32:31.470] Explain it like I'm five.
[00:32:31.470] 用五岁小孩都能听懂的方式解释一下。
[00:32:33.530] Ooh, yes.
[00:32:33.530] 哦，是的。
[00:32:34.350] So kind of in that similar vein, try to be able to explain things really simply so that anyone could understand it.
[00:32:34.350] 所以，从类似的角度来说，尽量用最简单的方式解释事情，让任何人都能理解。
[00:32:41.970] That also entails being clear and concise, which you also mentioned earlier too.
[00:32:41.970] 这还包括表达要清晰简洁，这一点你之前也提到过。
[00:32:46.770] Dude, I feel like this is totally something that you pick up on during meetings or all hands or like presentations.
[00:32:46.770] 兄弟，我觉得这完全是在会议、全体员工大会或者演讲之类的场合才会注意到的事情。
[00:32:54.590] You can always tell people who can do this skill and people who can't.
[00:32:54.590] 你总能分辨出哪些人会这项技能，哪些人不会。
[00:33:00.310] And I feel like the people who can explain things very clearly but promptly are the ones who like really deliver their message and like get their point across.
[00:33:00.310] 我觉得那些能把事情解释得非常清楚、又很迅速的人，才是真正能传达信息、把观点说清楚的人。
[00:33:09.910] And the people who kind of like waffle about, you're kind of left wondering like, okay, what was the point of what you were saying?
[00:33:09.910] 而那些喜欢拐弯抹角的人，你会不禁纳闷，好吧，你说的到底是什么意思？
[00:33:17.810] Like you only have so much brain capacity.
[00:33:17.810] 就像你的大脑容量是有限的一样。
[00:33:20.470] Yeah.
[00:33:20.470] 是的。
[00:33:20.710] And sometimes meetings move fast.
[00:33:20.710] 而且有时候会议进行得很快。
[00:33:22.190] So it's always nice when people are very concise and clear.
[00:33:22.190] 所以，人们说话简洁明了总是令人愉快的。
[00:33:26.210] And I think the people who are really good at cutting through the noise and like being able to communicate these things are always the people who interject.
[00:33:26.210] 我认为那些真正善于拨开迷雾、喜欢表达这些想法的人，总是那些喜欢插话的人。
[00:33:34.010] And they're like, okay, I think what you're saying is that the takeaway is, well, they like summarize whatever the person just said.
[00:33:34.010] 他们会说，好吧，我想你的意思是，重点是，嗯，他们就像是总结了那个人刚才说的话。
[00:33:41.830] I think they're just like, let me just save everyone's time.
[00:33:41.830] 我觉得他们只是想节省大家的时间。
[00:33:45.610] Clarify.
[00:33:45.610] 阐明。
[00:33:47.190] I mean, there's definitely been moments where I send out an email and then I'm like, after it's sent, I'm like, oh my God, this is the most convoluted email I've ever typed out.
[00:33:47.190] 我的意思是，确实有那么一些时候，我发出一封电子邮件后，心想，我的天哪，这是我写过的最复杂的一封电子邮件。
[00:33:55.770] So I like immediately follow up.
[00:33:55.770] 所以我喜欢立即跟进。
[00:33:58.430] Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:58.430] 我的天哪，我太抱歉了。
[00:33:59.150] Just to clarify like one sentence.
[00:33:59.150] 简单解释一下。
[00:34:02.130] Yes, I know.
[00:34:02.130] 是的，我知道。
[00:34:03.110] I think this is my problem too.
[00:34:03.110] 我觉得这也是我的问题。
[00:34:04.750] I'm not a very concise person.
[00:34:04.750] 我说话不太简洁。
[00:34:06.170] I like to present all the info, detail everything.
[00:34:06.170] 我喜欢把所有信息都呈现出来，事无巨细地讲清楚。
[00:34:10.070] And I'm especially bad about this in emails.
[00:34:10.070] 我尤其在电子邮件中容易犯这种错误。
[00:34:13.090] What I started doing is if you have like an internal AI tool that you can use, I started putting my shit into like the AI tool and be like, okay, can you make this more concise or can you simplify this or whatever?
[00:34:13.090] 我开始做的就是，如果你有一个可以使用的内部人工智能工具，我就开始把我的东西放进人工智能工具里，然后说，好吧，你能让它更简洁一些，或者你能简化一下这个等等吗？
[00:34:24.190] And then it really helps me kind of like weed out the things that I need and don't need.
[00:34:24.190] 然后它真的能帮助我筛选出我需要和不需要的东西。
[00:34:29.070] Yes, that's very smart.
[00:34:29.070] 是的，这非常聪明。
[00:34:30.430] I've definitely been testing that out a little more here and there as well.
[00:34:30.430] 我最近也时不时地进行了一些测试。
[00:34:34.550] It also works when you just can't think of anything to write.
[00:34:34.550] 当你实在想不出要写什么的时候，它也很适用。
[00:34:37.630] And you're like, can you help me like come up with a paragraph about this?
[00:34:37.630] 然后你就会想，你能帮我写一段关于这个主题的文字吗？
[00:34:42.890] I feel like the more I use our internal AI thing, the more I'm like, damn, in like 10 years, I'm just going to forget how to start an email from scratch.
[00:34:42.890] 我觉得我越是使用我们内部的人工智能系统，就越觉得，哎，再过十年，我可能就忘了怎么从头开始写一封电子邮件了。
[00:34:51.570] Oh my God.
[00:34:51.570] 我的天啊。
[00:34:52.010] You know what I mean?
[00:34:52.010] 你知道我的意思？
[00:34:55.370] But that means we'll be able to use our brains for more complicated tasks.
[00:34:55.370] 但这意味着我们将能够利用我们的大脑来完成更复杂的任务。
[00:35:00.190] So true.
[00:35:00.190] 如此真实。
[00:35:01.310] But I kind of fear that we've been glazing our former bosses and like the tips we've picked up from them for the last like 20 or whatever minutes.
[00:35:01.310] 但我有点担心，我们可能在过去的二十分钟里，对以前的老板们以及从他们那里学到的技巧都过于乐观了。
[00:35:12.330] So I do want to ask, is there anything that you've picked up from your former bosses that might be a negative or neutral habit?
[00:35:12.330] 所以我想问一下，你从以前的老板那里学到了什么不好的或中性的习惯吗？
[00:35:22.010] Yes. And I think luckily I haven't really picked it up into my own routine.
[00:35:22.010] 是的。而且我觉得幸运的是，我还没有把它养成自己的习惯。
[00:35:27.770] But I do sometimes notice that people can have not as good work-life balance.
[00:35:27.770] 但我有时确实注意到，有些人无法很好地平衡工作与生活。
[00:35:33.810] And I definitely take note of that.
[00:35:33.810] 我一定会记下来。
[00:35:36.170] And I just, it's a reminder to myself.
[00:35:36.170] 这只是给我自己一个提醒。
[00:35:38.110] For now, I'm very capable of being able to finish my things within the workday.
[00:35:38.110] 目前，我完全有能力在工作日内完成我的事情。
[00:35:44.110] So make sure I don't force myself to have to work outside of my normal hours.
[00:35:44.110] 所以请确保我不会强迫自己加班。
[00:35:50.610] Just because to me, I think work-life balance is very important.
[00:35:50.610] 因为对我来说，我认为工作与生活的平衡非常重要。
[00:35:54.650] And sometimes it works for other people to like work at a little bit of an off hour or whatever.
[00:35:54.650] 有时候，对其他人来说，稍微错开工作时间工作也挺合适的。
[00:36:00.030] But I think ultimately it would not be good for my happiness.
[00:36:00.030] 但我认为最终这对我的幸福没有好处。
[00:36:07.190] Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:36:07.190] 没错，你说得很有道理。
[00:36:08.770] I feel like this kind of stuff really seeps into your personal lifestyle too.
[00:36:08.770] 我觉得这类事情也会渗透到你的个人生活方式中。
[00:36:13.570] And it's not always just like direct stuff.
[00:36:13.570] 而且它并不总是像直接的事情那样。
[00:36:15.750] It doesn't have to be your boss piling on a ton of work or forcing you to work past five.
[00:36:15.750] 不一定是你的老板给你安排大量工作，或者强迫你加班到五点以后。
[00:36:21.090] But I think it can come in the form of like comments made in passing.
[00:36:21.090] 但我认为它可以以随口说的话的形式出现。
[00:36:25.770] My friend told me a story about how her boss was like,
[00:36:25.770] 我朋友跟我讲了她老板的为人，
[00:36:29.730] Oh, so strange working for a company where people actually leave the office before 7 p.m.
[00:36:29.730] 哦，在一家员工晚上7点前就下班的公司工作真是太奇怪了。
[00:36:35.930] And I remember when she told me the story.
[00:36:35.930] 我还记得她给我讲这个故事的时候。
[00:36:37.670] I was just like, dude, what the fuck?
[00:36:37.670] 我当时就想，老兄，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:36:39.110] If my boss told me that, I would forever be stressing like,
[00:36:39.110] 如果老板这么跟我说，我会一直焦虑不安。
[00:36:41.850] Oh, does this person expect me to stay past 7 p.m.?
[00:36:41.850] 哦，这个人是想让我待到晚上7点以后吗？
[00:36:44.970] Yeah. Oh my god.
[00:36:44.970] 是啊。我的天哪。
[00:36:46.610] Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:36:46.610] 是的，我不喜欢那样。
[00:36:47.930] It's like very encouraging.
[00:36:47.930] 这真是令人鼓舞。
[00:36:50.850] Yeah, it's just like too much, I think.
[00:36:50.850] 是啊，我觉得有点过头了。
[00:36:52.630] Very, very luckily my org and the people I work with generally don't force that onto other people.
[00:36:52.630] 非常幸运的是，我的组织和我共事的人通常不会强迫其他人这样做。
[00:36:59.730] Even if they themselves might work past their regular work hours occasionally,
[00:36:59.730] 即使他们自己偶尔会加班，
[00:37:05.410] we try not to like force that onto each other.
[00:37:05.410] 我们尽量不强迫对方接受那种观点。
[00:37:08.230] It's healthy in the sense where it's like,
[00:37:08.230] 从某种意义上说，它是健康的，就像……
[00:37:10.450] if I'm working past my normal hours, it's probably my own fault.
[00:37:10.450] 如果我工作时间超过正常时长，那很可能是我自己的原因。
[00:37:15.730] So it's like kind of keeping yourself accountable.
[00:37:15.730] 所以这就像是自我约束一样。
[00:37:18.050] Very luckily, we don't have a culture where we expect people to like be on in the middle of the night or any of that sort of thing.
[00:37:18.050] 非常幸运的是，我们没有那种期望人们在半夜值班之类的文化。
[00:37:26.030] Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:37:26.030] 对，对，完全正确。
[00:37:27.410] I think I've had either bosses or cross-functional partners that did sort of prefer that lifestyle of being always on.
[00:37:27.410] 我觉得我遇到过一些老板或者跨部门合作伙伴，他们似乎更喜欢那种时刻在线的生活方式。
[00:37:36.730] And it's a huge stress.
[00:37:36.730] 这压力太大了。
[00:37:37.770] You might be done with work and you log off, but you see urgent Slack messages or like texts or phone calls come in and you're like,
[00:37:37.770] 你可能已经完成了工作并下线了，但你看到有紧急的 Slack 消息、短信或电话进来，你就会想：
[00:37:44.490] oh, okay, time to reboot my laptop.
[00:37:44.490] 哦，好的，该重启我的笔记本电脑了。
[00:37:47.230] I know we've said no more glazing, but one useful tip that I learned was someone likes to put in their email signature,
[00:37:47.230] 我知道我们已经说过不再添加釉面，但我学到的一个实用技巧是，有人喜欢在他们的电子邮件签名中添加：
[00:37:55.930] I log off at, I don't know, like 6 p.m. PST.
[00:37:55.930] 我大概在太平洋标准时间下午 6 点左右下线。
[00:38:01.450] So please don't expect me to answer until the following day if you email me past that time.
[00:38:01.450] 所以，如果您在那个时间之后给我发邮件，请不要指望我会在第二天回复。
[00:38:07.310] You know, something more concise than that.
[00:38:07.310] 你知道，应该用更简洁的方式表达。
[00:38:09.470] But I thought that was a really helpful tip, especially if you work with people who are maybe international.
[00:38:09.470] 但我认为这是一个非常有用的建议，特别是如果你要和来自世界各地的人一起工作的话。
[00:38:16.970] Sometimes they forget you're on a different time zone.
[00:38:16.970] 有时候他们会忘记你身处不同的时区。
[00:38:19.590] So it's a friendly reminder or nudge that can be helpful here and there.
[00:38:19.590] 所以这是一种友好的提醒或提示，在某些时候可能会有所帮助。
[00:38:25.270] Can you imagine if we all just set our Slack emoji to the ghost emoji after 5 p.m.?
[00:38:25.270] 你能想象如果我们下午 5 点以后都把 Slack 表情符号设置成幽灵表情符号会是什么样子吗？
[00:38:33.000] Like, you can Slack me, but I'm going to ghost you until tomorrow.
[00:38:33.000] 你可以加我 Slack，但我会一直屏蔽你到明天。
[00:38:36.280] So funny.
[00:38:36.280] 太搞笑了。
[00:38:38.000] I actually just always set my status as away or invisible so people don't know if I'm actually online or not.
[00:38:38.000] 我其实总是把状态设为离开或隐身，这样别人就不知道我是否真的在线了。
[00:38:46.540] That's wild, dude.
[00:38:46.540] 太疯狂了，老兄。
[00:38:47.780] I think it sets the precedent that like, oh, I don't know if she'll respond or not.
[00:38:47.780] 我认为这开了个先例，那就是，哦，我不知道她会不会回应。
[00:38:54.600] Oh my god.
[00:38:54.600] 我的天啊。
[00:38:55.720] I just have, you know, the Slack.
[00:38:55.720] 我只有个Slack账号。
[00:38:57.060] Slack, you can set it to not give you notifications past a certain time or something.
[00:38:57.060] Slack，你可以设置让它在某个时间之后不再发送通知之类的。
[00:39:01.440] I feel like whenever you see that like ZZZ at a certain hour, you know, like, okay, this person is probably not on.
[00:39:01.440] 我觉得每当你在某个时间看到 ZZZ 这样的字样时，你就会想，好吧，这个人可能没在线。
[00:39:07.120] So I just have that on auto every day.
[00:39:07.120] 所以我每天都设置成自动运行。
[00:39:10.620] Oh, that's smart.
[00:39:10.620] 哦，这主意不错。
[00:39:11.800] But Slack is actually something that I feel like your boss's preferences also seep into your work habits.
[00:39:11.800] 但我觉得，实际上，你老板的喜好也会潜移默化地影响你的工作习惯，而Slack正是这种影响的体现。
[00:39:18.000] So I've had a boss who is very like email is the way to go.
[00:39:18.000] 我曾遇到一位非常支持使用电子邮件沟通的老板。
[00:39:22.380] And then Slack is like for very urgent needs or whatnot.
[00:39:22.380] Slack 则用于处理非常紧急的需求或其他情况。
[00:39:25.540] So then I was very into like emailing for a while.
[00:39:25.540] 所以有一段时间我特别喜欢发电子邮件。
[00:39:28.280] And then I feel like with other bosses, they're way more on Slack and then email is only for like specific, more formal forms of communication or maybe reporting or cross-functional communication.
[00:39:28.280] 然后我觉得其他老板更倾向于使用 Slack，而电子邮件只用于特定的、更正式的沟通方式，或者用于汇报工作或跨部门沟通。
[00:39:38.700] So then getting used to that was definitely a little bit more interesting.
[00:39:38.700] 所以，适应这一点确实更有趣一些。
[00:39:42.220] It's like I became an email expert and then I had to become like a Slack person.
[00:39:42.220] 感觉就像我先成了电子邮件专家，然后又不得不变成 Slack 专家一样。
[00:39:48.660] And I think it doesn't sound that big of a change if you're only emailing a couple people at a time and then only slacking a couple people at a time.
[00:39:48.660] 如果你一次只给几个人发邮件，一次只用 Slack 联系几个人，我觉得这听起来不算什么大的变化。
[00:39:56.940] But I'm talking about going from emailing a hundred people and then slacking a hundred people.
[00:39:56.940] 但我说的是先给一百个人发邮件，然后再用 Slack 给一百个人打电话。
[00:40:03.940] You know, I feel like it's like very scary and kind of like a completely new world.
[00:40:03.940] 你知道吗，我觉得这很可怕，就像一个全新的世界。
[00:40:09.140] Yeah.
[00:40:09.140] 是的。
[00:40:09.700] Not to make it sound like a huge deal or anything, but it kind of is.
[00:40:09.700] 我不想把这件事说得好像很严重似的，但实际上确实很严重。
[00:40:13.420] That's a lot.
[00:40:13.420] 那可真不少。
[00:40:14.180] But I think in my work chat, the biggest group that I actively talk in for work related stuff is eight.
[00:40:14.180] 但我认为在我的工作聊天群里，我经常参与讨论工作相关事情的最大群组是八人群。
[00:40:23.760] Usually it's all just one on one chats.
[00:40:23.760] 通常都是一对一聊天。
[00:40:26.600] That was like what I was used to, too.
[00:40:26.600] 那也是我以前习惯的那种情况。
[00:40:29.100] Occasionally there would be a specific project group chat or whatever, but it was never that big.
[00:40:29.100] 偶尔会有专门的项目群聊之类的，但规模从来都不大。
[00:40:33.940] And I feel like even each group chat has its different culture.
[00:40:33.940] 我觉得即使是每个群聊也有自己不同的文化。
[00:40:38.020] Like some group chats are very, you know, you put a lot of emojis and like GIFs into it and whatnot.
[00:40:38.020] 比如有些群聊，你知道，里面会放很多表情符号、GIF 之类的东西。
[00:40:43.220] And other group chats are very like formal, you know.
[00:40:43.220] 而其他群聊则非常正式，你知道的。
[00:40:46.740] True.
[00:40:46.740] 真的。
[00:40:47.940] So all of this stuff in Slack, you kind of have to like move and adapt to.
[00:40:47.940] 所以，Slack 里的所有这些东西，你都得慢慢适应。
[00:40:52.340] Yeah.
[00:40:52.340] 是的。
[00:40:52.820] You're like, is it appropriate if I react to this with a silly GIF?
[00:40:52.820] 你会想，我用一个搞笑的 GIF 来回应这件事合适吗？
[00:40:59.260] I'm like, how crazy can I go?
[00:40:59.260] 我当时想，我能有多疯狂？
[00:41:02.880] And then I love how like sometimes in some spaces a certain emoji or GIF is used so much and you're like, okay, this is like the go to safe option.
[00:41:02.880] 然后我喜欢这种感觉：有时候在某些地方，某个表情符号或 GIF 被频繁使用，你会觉得，好吧，这就像是安全的首选选项。
[00:41:11.920] Oh my God.
[00:41:11.920] 我的天啊。
[00:41:12.420] Yes.
[00:41:12.420] 是的。
[00:41:13.200] Yes.
[00:41:13.200] 是的。
[00:41:14.160] So true.
[00:41:14.160] 如此真实。
[00:41:14.920] True.
[00:41:14.920] 真的。
[00:41:15.220] But I do think in terms of learning negative or neutral things from bosses, kind of what I mentioned at the beginning of the episode when I had a not as great boss, it really helped me pinpoint like what are some things that are not too great that I should be on the lookout for.
[00:41:15.220] 但我确实认为，从老板身上学习一些负面或中性的事情，就像我在本集开头提到的，当我遇到一个不太好的老板时，这真的帮助我准确地指出了哪些不太好的事情是我应该注意的。
[00:41:33.760] So yeah, lack of feedback, lack of communication, maybe the general sense of a company's structure too, looking at that and recognizing if it's a structure that you'll be able to thrive in or if it's one that maybe you don't fit into as well.
[00:41:33.760] 所以，是的，缺乏反馈、缺乏沟通，或许还有对公司整体结构的感受，要审视这些，并认识到你是否能在这种结构中茁壮成长，或者你是否不太适合这种结构。
[00:41:49.220] Yeah, that's such a good point.
[00:41:49.220] 没错，你说得太对了。
[00:41:51.260] I feel like the structure thing is interesting too because oftentimes when you're a junior level employee, the structure doesn't really feel as visible or like impactful to you because you're kind of a cog.
[00:41:51.260] 我觉得组织结构也很有趣，因为很多时候，当你是一名初级员工时，组织结构对你来说并不那么明显或有影响，因为你就像一个齿轮。
[00:42:02.900] But the more you go up your chain of command, they are the people who are contributing to the structure and helping to form it.
[00:42:02.900] 但是，你越往上追溯你的指挥链，就越会发现他们是为组织结构做出贡献并帮助形成组织结构的人。
[00:42:10.780] So I think if you look up and you don't feel as much faith or trust in what is happening or like their powers or capabilities, it could be a sign to leave too.
[00:42:10.780] 所以我觉得，如果你抬头仰望，却对正在发生的事情，或者对他们的力量或能力感到不那么有信心或信任，那也可能是一个离开的信号。
[00:42:22.160] So I think that's a good point.
[00:42:22.160] 所以我觉得这是一个很好的观点。
[00:42:23.900] So I have a final question for us.
[00:42:23.900] 最后一个问题，我来问大家。
[00:42:26.860] Do you think the first boss you ever have is more impactful than any future boss?
[00:42:26.860] 你认为你遇到的第一个老板比以后的任何老板都更有影响力吗？
[00:42:34.200] Low key, yes.
[00:42:34.200] 低调点，是的。
[00:42:35.780] At least for me, I think this rings very true.
[00:42:35.780] 至少对我来说，我认为这话非常有道理。
[00:42:38.700] I did work with my first boss for a very long time and he was like a fantastic boss.
[00:42:38.700] 我和我的第一位老板共事了很长时间，他是一位非常棒的老板。
[00:42:44.600] So I feel like for me, I can confidently say yes.
[00:42:44.600] 所以我觉得，就我个人而言，我可以自信地说“是”。
[00:42:47.580] But I also wonder if it's kind of like your first real boss, you know, like if you don't consider someone a real boss, they might not be your first.
[00:42:47.580] 但我也在想，这是否有点像你的第一个真正意义上的老板，你知道，如果你不认为某人是真正的老板，那么他可能就不是你的第一个老板。
[00:42:56.500] My answer to this is yes, to a certain extent.
[00:42:56.500] 我的答案是肯定的，在某种程度上。
[00:43:00.220] Because in the beginning, we're so ignorant.
[00:43:00.220] 因为在最初，我们是如此无知。
[00:43:03.840] We don't really know what's going on in the work world.
[00:43:03.840] 我们其实并不了解职场上正在发生的事情。
[00:43:07.180] So I think the first boss leaves a big impression.
[00:43:07.180] 所以我觉得第一个boss给人留下了深刻的印象。
[00:43:11.520] Whether they're there to build you up and help teach you and show you the ropes of what a good boss looks like.
[00:43:11.520] 无论他们是来帮助你成长、指导你，还是来向你展示一个好老板应该是什么样子。
[00:43:18.560] It's a pretty deep impression.
[00:43:18.560] 这给我留下了很深刻的印象。
[00:43:20.820] I'm just imagining like what if I was really unlucky and had a terrible boss to begin with?
[00:43:20.820] 我只是在想，如果我运气真的很差，一开始就遇到一个糟糕的老板，那会怎么样？
[00:43:27.120] I think that would kind of dampen my mood.
[00:43:27.120] 我觉得那样会让我心情不太好。
[00:43:29.960] Maybe it would make me look in the future with a more negative or like Debbie Downer kind of attitude.
[00:43:29.960] 也许这会让我以后看待事物时更加消极悲观，或者像个扫兴鬼一样。
[00:43:36.420] This is just how work is.
[00:43:36.420] 这就是工作。
[00:43:37.760] You just have to suffer through it or something.
[00:43:37.760] 你只能默默忍受了。
[00:43:40.540] But if you if the stage is set with more positive vibes like, oh, wow, I'm learning so much.
[00:43:40.540] 但如果舞台布置得更积极一些，比如，哇，我学到了好多东西。
[00:43:46.440] This boss taught me like the career ladder and like gave me tips.
[00:43:46.440] 这位老板教会了我职业发展之路，还给了我很多建议。
[00:43:50.960] And like now I know I feel prepared as I go into these next stages of work life.
[00:43:50.960] 就像现在，我知道自己已经为进入职业生涯的下一个阶段做好了准备。
[00:43:56.840] I think that definitely can be very effective.
[00:43:56.840] 我认为这绝对会非常有效。
[00:44:01.000] Yeah, I think you're right in that your first boss definitely sets the tone for how you even view bosses or like work in general.
[00:44:01.000] 是的，我觉得你说得对，你的第一位老板确实会奠定你对老板的看法以及你对工作的整体感受。
[00:44:09.880] But I wonder if it's kind of like the concept of a first love where it's like, you know, you see a multitude of different people.
[00:44:09.880] 但我很好奇，这是否有点像初恋的概念，就像，你知道，你会看到很多不同的人。
[00:44:18.020] And then you're kind of like, yeah, this person's cool, whatever.
[00:44:18.020] 然后你就会想，嗯，这个人还不错，就这样吧。
[00:44:21.620] But then it's not real until you find someone who you're like, yeah, you are my first love and you like give them the crown.
[00:44:21.620] 但只有当你遇到一个让你觉得“是的，你就是我的初恋”的人，并把桂冠献给他/她时，一切才算真正开始。
[00:44:30.980] So that's what I mean of like you choose your first boss.
[00:44:30.980] 这就是我说的，就像你选择你的第一位老板一样。
[00:44:34.780] You know what I mean?
[00:44:34.780] 你知道我的意思？
[00:44:36.460] OK, that just sounds like you're choosing the first boss that was good.
[00:44:36.460] 好吧，听起来你只是选择了第一个表现不错的 Boss。
[00:44:42.780] OK, fair, fair.
[00:44:42.780] 好吧，公平，公平。
[00:44:45.540] But, you know, not every boss is worthy of being called your first boss.
[00:44:45.540] 但是，你知道，并不是每个老板都配得上被称为你的第一位老板。
[00:44:50.880] Right.
[00:44:50.880] 正确的。
[00:44:51.640] OK, I guess.
[00:44:51.640] 好吧，我同意。
[00:44:53.120] I suppose like this one was just a fling.
[00:44:53.120] 我猜这只是一段露水情缘。
[00:44:59.820] Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:59.820] 对，没错。
[00:45:01.800] That one's not real because they were just my boss for X amount of months.
[00:45:01.800] 那不是真的，因为他/她只是我几个月的老板而已。
[00:45:08.320] You have the power to legitimize your first boss.
[00:45:08.320] 你有能力使你的第一位老板合法化。
[00:45:13.480] I guess that's fair.
[00:45:13.480] 我觉得这很合理。
[00:45:14.820] You chose your first boss to be someone from post-college.
[00:45:14.820] 你选择的第一任老板是大学毕业后认识的人。
[00:45:18.500] But I consider one of my first bosses during college.
[00:45:18.500] 但我认为他是我大学期间的第一位老板。
[00:45:23.000] How empowering is this message, guys?
[00:45:23.000] 这条信息是不是很鼓舞人心？
[00:45:25.700] The power within.
[00:45:25.700] 内在的力量。
[00:45:27.340] You choose your own fate.
[00:45:27.340] 命运掌握在自己手中。
[00:45:30.800] But I do think similar to a first love as time goes on, it fades because you eventually find, you know, your partner for life.
[00:45:30.800] 但我确实觉得，就像初恋一样，随着时间的推移，它会逐渐消逝，因为你最终会找到你的终身伴侣。
[00:45:42.220] Wait a minute.
[00:45:42.220] 等一下。
[00:45:46.620] Now I'm getting all confused.
[00:45:46.620] 我现在彻底糊涂了。
[00:45:50.060] I guess what I'm trying to say is that in the beginning, the first boss leaves a big impact.
[00:45:50.060] 我想表达的是，在游戏初期，第一个 Boss 会给人留下深刻的印象。
[00:45:55.480] But maybe as you get older and like gain more experience and start to feel more confident and comfortable in yourself, that first boss's impact starts to fade a bit because you've like ascended it, if that makes sense.
[00:45:55.480] 但也许随着年龄增长，经验增多，你开始对自己更有信心、更自在，第一个老板的影响就会开始减弱，因为你已经晋升到了更高的职位，如果这样说你能理解的话。
[00:46:09.440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:09.440] 是啊是啊。
[00:46:10.680] That totally makes sense.
[00:46:10.680] 完全说得通。
[00:46:11.980] But now I'm thinking like, who is going to be my final boss?
[00:46:11.980] 但我现在在想，谁会是我的最终boss呢？
[00:46:15.260] Like the boss that I marry?
[00:46:15.260] 就像我嫁的那个老板一样？
[00:46:17.160] It's you.
[00:46:17.160] 是你。
[00:46:18.580] Oh my God.
[00:46:18.580] 我的天啊。
[00:46:20.780] Wow.
[00:46:20.780] 哇。
[00:46:21.260] Wow.
[00:46:21.260] 哇。
[00:46:21.980] This episode has taken a crazy turn.
[00:46:21.980] 剧情走向真是出乎意料。
[00:46:27.520] Well, I think that's quite a hopeful way to end the episode, actually.
[00:46:27.520] 嗯，我觉得这其实是一个相当令人鼓舞的结尾方式。
[00:46:32.000] But it definitely has been interesting to sit down and talk through some of the tips that we've retained from our former bosses.
[00:46:32.000] 但坐下来好好聊聊我们从前任老板那里学到的一些经验，确实很有意思。
[00:46:39.340] It's interesting to see that a lot of our tips that you and I have collected are quite similar.
[00:46:39.340] 很有意思的是，你我收集的很多建议都非常相似。
[00:46:43.820] So I'm interested to see if any of our listeners have any tips that they've retained from their former bosses.
[00:46:43.820] 所以我很想知道我们的听众中是否有人能分享一下他们从前任老板那里学到的一些经验和技巧。
