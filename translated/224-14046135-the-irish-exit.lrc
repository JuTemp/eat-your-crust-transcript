[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal So this is actually a big episode for us because it's our last episode of the season last episode of the year and Rejoining everyone in January next year because I am getting married
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。这期节目对我们来说意义非凡，因为这是我们本季最后一期，也是今年的最后一期。明年一月我会和大家再次相聚，因为我要结婚了。
[00:00:30.790] We talked about my upcoming wedding a bunch this year, but it's actually finally happening soon So we'll head out of the season a little bit earlier this year But hopefully next year we'll be back with a bigger and better season for you all. Woohoo
[00:00:30.790] 今年我们聊了很多关于我即将举行的婚礼，但它真的很快就要举行了！所以今年我们会提前结束这个季节。但希望明年我们能带着更盛大、更精彩的季节回归，为大家带来更多精彩内容！耶！
[00:00:45.410] Yeah, I'm excited and I think it just made the most sense because weddings are a lot of work So at the time that we're recording this we're getting really close to the wedding not to freak you out Jeesoo
[00:00:45.410] 是的，我很兴奋，而且我觉得这是最合理的选择，因为婚礼筹备工作量很大。所以，在我们录制这段视频的时候，婚礼真的快到了，别担心，Jeesoo。
[00:00:55.730] Oh my god, I feel like every time I see someone they're like, oh my god the wedding so soon Are you excited? And I'm like, I don't know if excited is the right word, but I do feel something
[00:00:55.730] 天哪，我感觉每次见到别人，他们都会说：“天哪，婚礼马上就要到了，你兴奋吗？” 我心想，我不知道“兴奋”这个词用得对不对，但我确实有种特别的感觉。
[00:01:06.010] It's like every time we see you you just have a panic attack Like don't talk about the wedding. Don't talk about the wedding We had like a dinner earlier and we were like, all right, we're banning the word wedding
[00:01:06.010] 感觉每次见到你你都像突然恐慌发作一样，比如“别提婚礼！别提婚礼！”我们之前一起吃过晚饭，当时我们就说，好吧，我们禁止谈论“婚礼”这个词。
[00:01:19.370] Like no one mentioned the wedding. Yeah, dude, it's stressful But I think because everyone else is so excited it does give me a little bit of excitement
[00:01:19.370] 好像没人提婚礼的事儿似的。是啊，兄弟，确实挺让人头疼的。不过我觉得正因为大家都那么兴奋，我也跟着有点儿兴奋起来。
[00:01:28.050] So, you know always that balance of making sure everything goes well enough but also feeling the joy and excitement of these things well, our topic today is actually kind of relevant because Most of our longtime listeners know we take a break around this time
[00:01:28.050] 所以，你知道，既要确保一切顺利，又要感受其中的喜悦和兴奋，这始终是一种平衡。我们今天的话题其实挺应景的，因为我们的大多数老听众都知道，我们会在这个时候休息一段时间。
[00:01:44.210] Anyway, usually we do it two weeks into December so this time we're leaving a little early and we considered not really saying anything and just letting it happen and That's very relevant to our topic because our topic is the Irish exit
[00:01:44.210] 总之，我们通常都是在十二月下旬离开，所以这次我们提前了一点。我们考虑过什么也不说，就顺其自然。这和我们今天的主题非常相关，因为我们的主题是爱尔兰的退出。
[00:02:01.390] The Irish exit to me is something that I Associate so heavily with crystal like I think crystal to me is one of the people who pulls off the Irish exit very well You pull it off. Well in a way, that's kind of funny
[00:02:01.390] 对我来说，爱尔兰式退场总是让我想起克里斯托，我觉得克里斯托是少数几个能把爱尔兰式退场演绎得淋漓尽致的人之一。你也演绎得很好。嗯，某种程度上来说，这有点滑稽。
[00:02:14.030] I feel like every time you pull it off I can just imagine you breathing like a sigh of relief or something Like it's not like effortless like you kind of put effort into it. So as the Irish exit expert crystal Can you please define this phrase? Yeah, sure
[00:02:14.030] 我觉得你每次成功的时候，我都能想象你像松了口气似的呼吸，好像这并非毫不费力，而是你付出了努力。所以，作为爱尔兰的“退出专家”，克里斯托，你能解释一下这个短语吗？好的，当然。
[00:02:29.230] So the Irish exit is just when you leave quietly without telling anyone So usually this is for like, you know bigger gatherings Parties things like that literally just don't say bye to anyone and you just leave So are there exceptions to this rule?
[00:02:29.230] 爱尔兰式离场法就是悄悄离开，不跟任何人说再见。通常这种做法适用于大型聚会、派对之类的场合，就是不跟任何人说再见，直接离开。那么，这条规则有例外吗？
[00:02:47.510] Is it still an Irish exit if you leave without saying bye to most people but say you Stop to check in with like the person who invited you or the host to let them know that you're leaving. Ooh Okay, technically that would make it not an Irish exit
[00:02:47.510] 如果你离开时没有跟大多数人道别，只是停下来跟邀请你的人或主人打了个招呼，告诉他们你要走了，这还能算是“爱尔兰式离别”吗？哦，好吧，严格来说，这就不算是“爱尔兰式离别”了。
[00:03:03.430] But I feel like if there's a like you only told one person Loki it kind of still is an Irish exit, right? Cuz like the idea is deep into the party or whatever people will just be like, oh wait
[00:03:03.430] 但我觉得，如果你只跟一个人说了洛基的事，那也算是某种意义上的“爱尔兰式退场”吧？因为这种想法会在派对进行到很深的时候出现，或者其他什么场合，人们会突然意识到，哦，等等
[00:03:16.590] Where did this one person go and everyone's just like I don't know like I guess they must have left So whenever I think of this Concept I always think of you know that like Homer Simpson meme where he's slowly retreating into the bushes It's so accurate
[00:03:16.590] 这个人去哪儿了？大家都不知道，好像是走了似的。所以每次想到这个概念，我都会想起《辛普森一家》里荷马·辛普森慢慢躲进灌木丛的那个梗图，简直太贴切了。
[00:03:34.110] I've seen the way Irish exits work out really well, especially if you are maybe Drinking with a lot of people like a bigger group then one It's easier to kind of slip away without someone noticing and that hubbub and craziness and the chaos of a lot of people
[00:03:34.110] 我见过很多爱尔兰式的溜走方式，效果都很好，尤其是在和很多人一起喝酒的时候，比如一大群人，很容易就能悄悄溜走而不被人注意到，尤其是在那种喧闹、疯狂和混乱的氛围中。
[00:03:49.150] But I think also the flip side of it is that for girls I wonder if it's a little bit harder because as a woman I feel like if my girlfriends disappeared then I would be really worried if they didn't tell me that they were leaving
[00:03:49.150] 但我觉得反过来想，对女生来说可能更难一些，因为作为女性，我觉得如果我的闺蜜突然消失，而她们又没有告诉我她们要离开，我会非常担心。
[00:04:02.110] Versus if a guy disappeared, I'd be like, okay like I guess you just left That's true. So maybe it's like easier if you Irish exit with someone. Oh True Yeah, I think like the ultimate goal is that you Irish exit at a point where you know
[00:04:02.110] 如果一个男人突然消失，我就会想，好吧，看来你只是离开了。确实如此。所以，如果你和某人一起“爱尔兰式退出”（指突然离开），也许会更容易些。哦，没错。是的，我认为最终目标是在你知道对方在哪儿的时候“爱尔兰式退出”。
[00:04:19.390] Maybe people are starting to get more drunk So then they don't notice at first and then when you reach the point of the party where most people are gone Then the thought is oh they must have just left with the big wave. Oh
[00:04:19.390] 也许人们开始喝得更醉了，所以一开始他们没注意到，等到派对进行到大部分人都离开的时候，他们才会想，哦，他们一定是随着那波大潮走了。哦
[00:04:34.310] That's smart. So it's very unnoticeable. Yeah, that's probably the most ideal Result of an Irish exit For you since you've actually used this tactic in the past Would you say it's easier to Irish exit from a party?
[00:04:34.310] 这招很聪明，所以很难被人注意到。是啊，这可能是你用爱尔兰式退出策略后最理想的结果了，因为你以前就用过这招。你觉得在派对上用爱尔兰式退出更容易吗？
[00:04:52.010] So say I like someone's house or someone's apartment or is it easier to Irish exit when you guys are out and about so like Bar hopping for example. Oh my god
[00:04:52.010] 比如说，我喜欢某人的房子或者公寓，或者当你们出去玩的时候，比如去酒吧之类的，是不是更容易溜出去？我的天哪
[00:05:00.830] Wait, actually bar hopping might be easier because in between the hopping you can just leave. Oh, that's true Just half-heartedly wave but then like no one sees you and you're like, that's Irish exit
[00:05:00.830] 等等，其实酒吧巡游可能更容易，因为你可以在巡游间隙随时离开。哦，确实如此。就漫不经心地挥挥手，假装没人看见，然后你就可以说：“这就是爱尔兰式的退场。”
[00:05:14.510] Yeah, cuz it's kind of chaotic sometimes when you're leaving the bar to go to the next one, right? I think that's the perfect opportunity, especially slightly later in the evening when people are a little less coherent Like suddenly at the next bar
[00:05:14.510] 是啊，因为离开一家酒吧去下一家的时候，场面有时候会很混乱，对吧？我觉得那是个绝佳的机会，尤其是在晚上稍微晚一点的时候，人们有点神志不清，就像突然出现在下一家酒吧一样。
[00:05:30.110] You only need six seats instead of seven and then people will just be like, oh, why did I think we had seven? And then just carries on. Oh See, okay I have a counterpoint to this because I feel like if I'm at someone's house for example
[00:05:30.110] 你只需要六个座位而不是七个，然后人们就会说，哦，我怎么会以为我们有七个呢？然后事情就顺其自然了。哦，你看，我对此有个不同的看法，因为我觉得如果我在某人家里，比如
[00:05:46.030] And it's like a big party usually what happens I think is like There's a bunch of people in the living room people in the kitchen people in the dining room people in like bedrooms and stuff So it's like, you know
[00:05:46.030] 就像开大型派对一样，通常的情况是这样的：客厅里挤满了人，厨房里有人，餐厅里有人，卧室里也有人，等等等等。你知道的。
[00:05:55.510] Each part of the house has like a different number of people and the people are always like filtering through I feel like when there's separation of the rooms like that It's easier to Irish exit because if I don't see you in the living room
[00:05:55.510] 房子的每个区域住的人都不一样，而且人总是来来往往。我觉得房间像这样分隔开来，更容易悄悄溜走，因为如果我在客厅里看不到你，就很容易溜走。
[00:06:05.870] I might be like Oh crystals in the bathroom or she's like in the kitchen or like she might be talking to these other people Or something like that, right? But the issue with house parties sometimes is that The exit is right in front of everyone. Ah
[00:06:05.870] 我可能会想，哦，她在浴室里摆弄水晶，或者她在厨房，或者她在和其他人聊天，诸如此类，对吧？但家庭聚会的问题有时在于，出口就在所有人面前。啊
[00:06:20.030] That's there's only one door And then it's like oh like people will notice if you know the front door opens or something But if like the area where people are gathered is not near the front door then I think it's a little easier to exit
[00:06:20.030] 那里只有一扇门。然后就会出现这种情况：如果你知道前门是开着的，人们就会注意到。但如果人们聚集的地方离前门比较远，那么我觉得离开就容易一些。
[00:06:36.990] My god, dude, you know how some people's houses like the parents put up a security system So every time the door opens, oh, yeah Dude, mine mine does that? I'm just imagining you trying to Irish exit and the bells like ding ding ding
[00:06:36.990] 我的天啊，哥们儿，你知道有些人家里装了安保系统吗？比如父母家装的那种。每次门一开，哦，哥们儿，我家也这样？我都能想象你试图溜出去，结果门铃叮叮叮响的样子了。
[00:06:51.590] Yeah, that's true, but I guess there is Some methods to do it in in like a house party Like maybe you go to the backyard and it's normal to be in the backyard Right, maybe and then from the backyard you escape out the like side
[00:06:51.590] 没错，确实如此，但我想在家庭聚会之类的场合，还是有一些办法的。比如，你可以去后院，在后院待着很正常，对吧？然后从后院逃出去。
[00:07:09.910] Are you jumping the fence or there's like the front gate to the back backyard, right? So that's one option Wait, I guess you could literally jump the fence But I think like the backyard fences tend to be like kind of creaky or you know, not super fluid
[00:07:09.910] 你是打算翻过围栏，还是说后院有个通往后院的前门？那也算一个办法。等等，我猜你确实可以翻过围栏。不过我觉得后院的围栏通常都比较松动，或者说不太结实。
[00:07:28.510] So I can see that being a pretty noisy exit potentially but people are allowed when they're talking That's true but it's like okay I need you to explain this to me because I would say that one of the things that I kind of enjoy about
[00:07:28.510] 所以我觉得那可能会是个很吵闹的出口，但人们在交谈的时候是被允许的。没错，但我觉得你需要给我解释一下，因为我想说，我喜欢的一点就是……
[00:07:42.750] parties or like going out with people is I kind of like saying bye to everyone at the end because it's like oh, you know because I think I like the
[00:07:42.750] 参加聚会或者和朋友出去玩的时候，我其实挺喜欢最后跟每个人说再见的，因为感觉就像，你知道，因为我觉得我喜欢这样。
[00:07:52.190] Hugging of it all it's like that. I'll see you next time and you just like exchange sweet words with each other especially when you're with people who Say you don't see them super often in your life
[00:07:52.190] 拥抱一切就是这样。下次再见，你们会互相说些甜言蜜语，尤其是在和那些你一生中不常见到的人在一起的时候。
[00:08:03.030] So to me, it's kind of like a meaningful point of the night Of course the greeting part like talking to them the whole night whatever but also when you depart it leaves like a conclusion Sort of for all the conversations that you had
[00:08:03.030] 对我来说，这就像是夜晚一个意义非凡的时刻。当然，问候环节，比如整晚和他们聊天什么的，还有告别的时候，也像是所有对话的总结。
[00:08:15.550] So to me, that's one of the deterrents of not wanting to do the irish exit because you would miss that so for you What would you say is like the main pull or like the main draw of the irish exit?
[00:08:15.550] 所以对我来说，这是不想选择爱尔兰式出境的原因之一，因为你会错过那里。那么对你来说，你觉得爱尔兰式出境的主要吸引力是什么？
[00:08:28.110] Okay, sometimes when you go and say bye to people they're like no don't go Come have one more shot with us and then You know, maybe you're like, okay One shot we're ubering back anyway
[00:08:28.110] 好吧，有时候你跟人道别的时候，他们会说“别走，再跟我们喝一杯”，然后你知道，你可能就会想，“好吧，就一杯，反正我们还要打车回去呢。”
[00:08:44.910] And then somehow next thing, you know, it's one hour later. You're playing rage cage You still haven't left right so I think it depends on who the host and guests are and also your timing So if you do it too early and people are too sober
[00:08:44.910] 然后不知不觉，一个小时就过去了。你还在玩《Rage Cage》，还没离开呢。所以我觉得这取决于主人和客人是谁，也取决于你安排的时间。如果你太早开始，大家都还很清醒……
[00:09:02.590] They'll be like wait, you can't leave yet. The party just started right? But if you leave a little too late they might also be like wait like you need to take another drink with us Play this game with us before you leave, you know something of that sort
[00:09:02.590] 他们会说：“等等，你不能走。派对才刚开始呢，对吧？”但如果你走得晚了点，他们也可能会说：“等等，你得跟我们再喝一杯，玩个游戏再走，你知道的，就是那种话。”
[00:09:17.550] And then it also depends on the people themselves. Like are they people who would be more prone to Asking you to stay for quote unquote one more drink one more game
[00:09:17.550] 而且这也取决于人本身。比如，他们是不是那种会邀请你“再喝一杯，再玩一局”的人。
[00:09:28.510] Whatever or are they the type of people that be like, oh, yeah, like you should get home and rest All very fair points I guess it makes sense because sometimes the night definitely does drag on and if you have responsibilities the next day or
[00:09:28.510] 不管怎样，他们是不是那种会说“哦，是啊，你应该回家休息”的人？这些观点都很有道理，我想这说得通，因为有时候夜晚确实会很漫长，如果你第二天还有责任要承担的话。
[00:09:42.910] You just don't want to stay out past a certain hour of the night that it makes sense to kind of irish exit I think also if you don't really know anyone too well, it's a little easier to irish exit
[00:09:42.910] 你只是不想在外待到深夜某个时间点之后，所以我觉得用“爱尔兰式离场”（irish exit）的方式离开比较合适。而且，如果你不太认识什么人，用这种方式离开也更容易一些。
[00:09:55.790] Especially if you can't find the host, you know, sometimes you're forced into irish exiting. That's true That's not even like yeah, that's like not even a choice at that point. It's just like I tried
[00:09:55.790] 尤其是找不到房东的时候，你知道，有时候你只能被迫退出。确实如此。那时候根本就没得选。就像我试过了一样。
[00:10:08.590] I tried to regular exit and then you can send a text in the morning and just be like oh my god It was so fun last night Thank you for hosting. Yeah Do you think it's easier to irish exit when you're by yourself?
[00:10:08.590] 我试着正常退出，然后你早上可以发短信说“天哪，昨晚太开心了，谢谢你招待我”。是啊，你觉得一个人的时候用爱尔兰式退出更容易吗？
[00:10:21.870] Or do you think it's like harder or easier to irish exit if you have a friend or a boyfriend or a group of friends? I guess So group definitely hard like you don't want to leave and then suddenly people are like, oh why does it feel so empty?
[00:10:21.870] 或者你觉得如果有朋友、男朋友或者一群朋友一起，离开会更难还是更容易？我觉得和一群朋友一起肯定更难，因为你不想离开，然后突然间大家会说，哦，为什么感觉这么空荡荡的？
[00:10:38.510] But I think if you're with one other person It's a little easier and maybe it makes you feel a little more Brave, I guess You know you're in it together you plan out your plot, you know, you time it and you leave you have the support
[00:10:38.510] 但我觉得，如果你和另一个人一起行动，会容易一些，也许也会让你感觉更勇敢一些。你知道你们一起行动，你们一起计划，你们一起把握时机，然后离开，你们有支持。
[00:10:55.150] And I guess if two people step out of the house together even if it's like through the front door and people are watching It's like somewhat normal. Like I wouldn't immediately assume that they were leaving
[00:10:55.150] 我想，如果两个人一起走出家门，哪怕只是从前门出去，就算有人看着，也算是比较正常的。我不会立刻觉得他们要离开。
[00:11:04.270] I'd be like, oh maybe they're grabbing something from their car or just you know talking outside or something like that So it could be a little bit less suspicious. I guess if you have a small group It's also doable because if you step out I don't know
[00:11:04.270] 我会想，哦，也许他们只是在车里拿东西，或者在外面聊天什么的。这样可能就不那么可疑了。我觉得如果是一小群人的话，这样做也行得通，因为如果你走出去，我也不知道会发生什么。
[00:11:17.310] Maybe you're taking a smoke break or like you said you're grabbing something from the car or you're just getting out To get some fresh air right and then you just never come back I can definitely see the the courage part too because
[00:11:17.310] 也许你只是抽根烟休息一下，或者像你说的，从车里拿点东西，或者只是想下车透透气，对吧？然后你就再也没回来。我完全能理解你说的勇气，因为
[00:11:31.230] I feel like I would have a lot of doubts of like, oh is it rude if I don't say bye or like Is it appropriate for me to exit like this? So what do you think kind of help you gauge?
[00:11:31.230] 我感觉自己会有很多顾虑，比如，如果我不说再见会不会很失礼？或者，我这样离开合适吗？所以，你觉得什么能帮助你判断呢？
[00:11:41.470] Is this okay for me to irish exit here? Okay, a lot of it honestly is why am I leaving? usually it's maybe I'm leaving a little earlier or i'm desperate to go home or something And you have to think you have to weigh Is it worth it?
[00:11:41.470] 我可以就此离开吗？说实话，很多时候我都在想我为什么要离开？通常是因为我想早点走，或者我太想回家之类的。你必须思考，你必须权衡，这样做值得吗？
[00:12:00.030] I could stay and you know have some fun with my friends or I could go home and rest up and you know Be all tucked into bed within the hour Depends on your mood That's true and I guess the other thing too is like
[00:12:00.030] 我可以留下来和朋友们玩玩，也可以回家休息，一个小时内就能钻进被窝。这取决于你的心情。确实如此，我想还有一点就是……
[00:12:14.030] For me, the biggest thing probably is saying bye to the host or the people who invited me so just gauging how Distracted they are or like how? Present they are at the time I guess if they're like really committed to like a drinking game for example
[00:12:14.030] 对我来说，最重要的可能是和主人或邀请我的人道别，所以我会观察他们当时有多心不在焉，或者说他们有多专注？比如，如果他们真的非常投入地玩喝酒游戏之类的。
[00:12:27.710] Or like having a really deep conversation with someone or like in some sort of social trance that I don't want to break Then that could even be almost more rude than to just irish exit like distracting them from whatever that they're doing at the time
[00:12:27.710] 或者就像和某人进行非常深入的交谈，或者陷入某种社交沉浸感，不想打破这种状态。那么，这样做甚至可能比直接离开更失礼，因为这会分散他们的注意力，让他们无法专注于当时正在做的事情。
[00:12:40.430] So for the most part i'll try to say bye But I guess I could see the irish exit working if i'm like, oh well, they're so busy There's not you know a true point like me going up and interrupting them to say bye
[00:12:40.430] 所以大多数情况下我会尽量说再见。但我想，如果我说“哦，他们太忙了”，那种“爱尔兰式离场”的方式或许也行得通。毕竟，我没必要走上前去打断他们说再见。
[00:12:51.950] Yeah, and if you think about it, honestly, you do irish exit from things but you don't realize it's an irish exit So for example like an event Maybe like a charity event or something And you go and you have your fun or whatever
[00:12:51.950] 是啊，仔细想想，说实话，你经常会“爱尔兰式退出”，但你却没意识到。比如说参加某个活动，像慈善活动之类的，你去了，玩得很开心什么的。
[00:13:09.710] Maybe you don't know anyone and you're just there with a friend or two. You're just like, okay, let's leave Oh, that's like irish exiting too, right? That's true
[00:13:09.710] 也许你谁也不认识，就和一两个朋友一起去。你就会想，好吧，我们走吧。哦，这跟爱尔兰式的离场方式也差不多，对吧？没错。
[00:13:17.790] That's a good point actually or like if your friend invites you to something and you don't like the friend knows the host But you don't you know, I wouldn't really say bye to the host because I don't really know that person
[00:13:17.790] 这确实是个好主意。比如说，如果你的朋友邀请你去某个地方，而你不喜欢，朋友认识主人，但你不认识，你知道，我可能不会跟主人说再见，因为我并不认识那个人。
[00:13:27.390] So yeah, I guess that's true. I think it's it's harder to pull off for Events where you personally know the host It's also maybe used more commonly than you realize You're like end the stigma on irish exit
[00:13:27.390] 所以，嗯，我想确实如此。我觉得如果你认识主办方，在活动中这样做就更难了。而且，它可能比你想象的更常用。你就像是在消除人们对爱尔兰式离境的偏见。
[00:13:45.330] Also a funny thing about the irish exit is that I actually first learned of it as the french exit. Oh And apparently that's how the people in the uk call it here in the states. We call it an irish exit
[00:13:45.330] 关于“爱尔兰式退出”，还有一件趣事：我最初听说它的时候，它其实叫“法国式退出”。哦，而且显然英国人也这么叫它，我们美国人就叫它“爱尔兰式退出”。
[00:13:59.650] Wait now that you say that I think one of our book club books was called the french exit It was like a book we read a couple months ago
[00:13:59.650] 等等，你这么一说，我想起来了，我们读书会好像有一本书叫《法式告别》。好像是我们几个月前读的那本书。
[00:14:06.850] I never connected it to the irish exit and I feel like it makes more sense how I learned it the french exit because the french have like a bit of a stigma or like stereotype of being blunt and sometimes almost rude
[00:14:06.850] 我之前从未将它与爱尔兰式出口联系起来，现在想想，我学的法语出口方式似乎更合理，因为法国人似乎有点直率甚至有时近乎粗鲁的刻板印象或偏见。
[00:14:22.770] So I was like, oh this makes total sense like that. This is named the french exit But irish people are actually Their stereotype is they're super like friendly and welcoming, right? So I thought it was funny that it's called the irish exit here
[00:14:22.770] 所以我就想，哦，这么一想就完全说得通了。这里叫“法式出口”，但爱尔兰人其实……他们的刻板印象是超级友好热情，对吧？所以我觉得这里叫“爱尔兰出口”挺有意思的。
[00:14:37.890] You're like does this make it easier for me to use it because i wish you were super nice but I guess that kind of brings up the Question of like when is the irish exit rude? I think from my perspective as a host
[00:14:37.890] 你会想，这样用起来是不是更方便？因为我希望你能特别友善。但我想这又引出了一个问题：什么时候“爱尔兰式离场”才算失礼？我想，从我作为主人的角度来看，应该会是这样。
[00:14:52.130] I don't usually host people that I don't know Usually everyone who comes over to our place are like our good friends or I guess at the highest degree of separation It's maybe like a friend of a close friend who i've met a bunch of times
[00:14:52.130] 我通常不招待不认识的人。来我家的人一般都是我的好朋友，或者至少关系很亲近。可能是我某个好朋友的朋友，见过好几次面之类的。
[00:15:04.930] If people were to come to our place and then irish exit, I feel like that would feel a little bit odd But that's because the people we're hosting are like people who I would expect to come and say like bye to me
[00:15:04.930] 如果有人来我们家，然后就一声不吭地走了，我觉得会有点奇怪。但这是因为，我们招待的这些人，都是那种我会期待他们来跟我说再见的人。
[00:15:16.690] And I don't mind getting interrupted if someone's leaving uh, they want to say bye because it's just you know part of the hosting process and whatnot, but yeah, I guess it's not something that I
[00:15:16.690] 如果有人要离开，想跟我道别，我并不介意被打断，因为你知道，这是招待客人过程中的一部分，等等。不过，我想这并不是我……
[00:15:27.090] Prefer and i've actually I don't think I can really remember a time where people really irish exited But maybe that just goes to show That they did it really well Yeah, I don't think
[00:15:27.090] 我更喜欢这样，而且我其实真的想不起来什么时候爱尔兰人真的退役了。但也许这正好说明他们做得非常出色。是的，我不这么认为。
[00:15:40.450] I'm, not sure if i'm aware of anyone irish exiting your place either. Wait, I do remember it was like my birthday. Oh Okay, the thing is like since me and james host as a couple too
[00:15:40.450] 我不确定我是否知道有哪个爱尔兰人从你家出来过。等等，我想起来了，那天好像是我的生日。哦，好吧，是因为我和詹姆斯也以情侣的身份主持过聚会。
[00:15:54.130] I feel like if someone says bye to james that that's like good enough Okay for the most part like sometimes I might actually be busy or something So right as long as our unit is getting like, you know, someone is yeah
[00:15:54.130] 我觉得如果有人跟詹姆斯说再见就足够了。好吧，大多数情况下是这样，不过有时候我可能真的会很忙什么的。所以，只要我们小组有人在就行了。
[00:16:06.530] Okay, so I think what i've done before at your place is i'll tell you i'm leaving but then i'll just quietly leave Yeah, yeah, but back to the like when is it rude I do think if it's a small gathering and you know everyone yeah
[00:16:06.530] 好吧，我以前在你家的时候都是这么做的，我会告诉你我要走了，然后悄悄地离开。嗯，嗯，但是回到“什么时候这样做才算失礼”这个问题，我觉得如果是小型聚会，而且大家都认识的话，嗯。
[00:16:23.330] It's like kind of rude to just leave especially if it's more intimate Like you're at someone's home So for example, if we were at your place for like a dinner and there's I don't know seven people I would probably feel extremely rude if I just left That's true
[00:16:23.330] 突然离开有点失礼，尤其是在比较私密的场合，比如在别人家里。举个例子，如果我们在你家吃晚饭，大概有七个人，我如果突然离开会觉得非常失礼。确实如此。
[00:16:41.010] And I guess like the smaller the group is I feel like the bigger the responsibility is for you to say bye to everyone actually For sure. I think i've only really irish exited when it's a large party and or I don't know too many people
[00:16:41.010] 我觉得人越少，就越有责任跟每个人道别。确实如此。我好像只有在大型聚会或者我不认识太多人的时候才会用“爱尔兰式告别”这种方式离开。
[00:16:57.730] It makes total sense because it's just I don't know the idea of having to like weave through these crowds of people At like a really packed house party, for example
[00:16:57.730] 这完全说得通，因为我实在无法想象在人山人海的聚会上，比如那种拥挤不堪的家庭聚会上，不得不穿梭在人群中的感觉。
[00:17:06.370] To like grab the hose tell them you're leaving and then weave back out through the crowds to the front door Sometimes it's just like damn. I can't believe I have to spend the next like five minutes doing this Yeah
[00:17:06.370] 就像抓起水管，告诉他们你要走了，然后穿过人群回到前门。有时候真是糟透了。我简直不敢相信我接下来还要花五分钟做这种事。是啊。
[00:17:16.690] Do you think it's an irish exit if you leave but then you send a text immediately after? Oh So I personally would consider that an irish exit because you didn't do like the proper like sign off basically but it still I think
[00:17:16.690] 你觉得如果你离开后马上发短信，这算不算“爱尔兰式离场”？哦，我个人觉得这算“爱尔兰式离场”，因为你没有像正式告别那样结束对话，但我觉得还是可以的。
[00:17:32.930] Cuts out a lot of that potential rudeness like if it was a situation where it could potentially be rude I think it is a alternative way to do it, dude
[00:17:32.930] 这样可以避免很多潜在的失礼情况，比如在那种情况下，如果说话方式可能显得失礼，我认为这是一种更好的处理方式，兄弟。
[00:17:41.490] Maybe you should just station yourself at the door next time. You're like, all right, if you're gonna leave you need to check in here I'm, sorry. You need to check out here. Wait, I didn't install like, you know, like the corporate badge in badge out systems
[00:17:41.490] 下次你或许应该直接守在门口。你可以说：“好吧，如果你要离开，需要在这里登记一下。不好意思，你需要在这里退房。”等等，我还没装那种公司用的打卡系统呢。
[00:17:53.490] Where the door only unlocks if you badge out It's like you need to put in a slip of paper that you hand out after they check out with you exactly That'd be so funny. Oh my god I think the other thing too for the irish exit is
[00:17:53.490] 只有刷卡才能解锁的门，就像你需要在退房后递交一张纸条一样。那也太搞笑了。我的天，我觉得爱尔兰式的出口还有一点需要注意。
[00:18:10.930] I feel like you can irish exit. Maybe the group you came with but not the party if that makes sense So for example, we've been talking a lot about oh You should probably say bye to the host and if you don't that's considered an irish exit
[00:18:10.930] 我觉得你可以“爱尔兰式离场”。也许可以和同行的朋友告别，但不能和整个派对告别，如果我这么说你能理解的话。举个例子，我们一直在讨论“你应该和主人说再见”这种行为，如果你不说，那就算是“爱尔兰式离场”。
[00:18:23.970] But say you went to a friend's party and you don't really know this person that well but you went with like a group of four and then halfway through you're like
[00:18:23.970] 但假设你去参加一个朋友的聚会，你其实并不太了解这个人，但你和大约四个人一起去的，然后到了中途，你突然觉得……
[00:18:31.890] I just want to leave and then you just like left then you're leaving like your carpool buddies, right? Like I feel like that would also be like an irish exit but just on a smaller molecular level
[00:18:31.890] 我只想离开，然后你就走了，就像你的拼车伙伴一样，对吧？我觉得那也像是爱尔兰式的离别，只不过程度更轻一些。
[00:18:41.650] You're right in a way. That is for sure an irish exit. Yeah Technically on the whole as well because you didn't tell anyone else. That's true
[00:18:41.650] 你说的某种程度上是对的。这确实是一种爱尔兰式的退出。嗯，严格来说也算是，因为你没告诉其他人。没错。
[00:18:50.210] But even if you told the host but not your carpool buddies, that'd be like kind of fucked up. That'd be so funny. Yeah They're like, okay, let's leave wait, where did where did Where'd they go? I do think though
[00:18:50.210] 但就算你只告诉了房东却没告诉拼车伙伴，那也挺尴尬的。那肯定很搞笑。是啊，他们会说，好吧，我们走吧，等等，他们去哪儿了？他们去哪儿了？不过我觉得……
[00:19:05.410] Kind of what you mentioned earlier sometimes when you need to pull off an irish exit There is a bit of plotting and planning involved Just imagine this, you know, you're trying to quietly leave Right now at the front door there just happens to be no one there
[00:19:05.410] 就像你之前提到的，有时候你需要悄悄离开，这其中确实需要一些策划和安排。想象一下，你正试图悄无声息地离开，而此时门口却空无一人。
[00:19:23.330] So you rush to the door you're turning the knob you're getting ready to pull or push whatever but the door Is locked and you're like, oh shit. Okay. How do I use the lock? Yeah, okay
[00:19:23.330] 于是你冲到门口，转动门把手，准备拉开或推开，结果发现门锁着，你心想：糟了。好吧。这锁怎么用？嗯，好吧
[00:19:32.770] And you're like, why do they have a complicated lock like one of those keypad ones and then on this side You like don't know if it's locked or unlocked
[00:19:32.770] 然后你就会想，为什么他们要用那种复杂的密码锁，而且这边你根本不知道是锁着的还是没锁的。
[00:19:41.330] And you don't know if you need like a phone to unlock it or if you can like manually unlock it You're just at this door like making a bunch of noise and eventually people are like, oh, what's that noise? They walk over and then you're like, oh, um
[00:19:41.330] 你不知道是不是需要用手机才能解锁，还是可以手动解锁。你就在门口弄出一堆动静，最后有人走过来问：“哦，那是什么声音？”然后你就说：“哦，嗯……”
[00:19:57.170] How do you unlock this Wait i'm dying Dude, also I feel like there's a certain routine that you have to do So of course before leaving you have to pee and then there's been times where i'm like, okay
[00:19:57.170] 怎么解锁这个？等等，我快笑死了。老兄，我觉得好像得按部就班地来。所以，当然，离开之前你得先去小便，然后有时候我会想，好吧
[00:20:09.010] We need to leave at like midnight. So then i'm like at 11 50 i'll go pee But then I go to the bathroom at 11 50. There's like a line Also, I think the important part is like even on the way to the front door
[00:20:09.010] 我们大概午夜就要走了。所以到了11点50分，我打算去小便。结果到了11点50分，厕所门口排起了长队。而且，我觉得重点是，甚至在去前门的路上……
[00:20:19.650] Like you said sometimes that route is filled with minds where there's like a bunch of groups of people that you know And of course, it's lovely to like say bye But when you're kind of trying to make a mad rush out of something
[00:20:19.650] 就像你说的，有时候那条路上会遇到很多你认识的人，就像一群群你认识的人。当然，道别总是很美好的。但当你急于求成的时候，就有点儿……
[00:20:32.370] I feel like that's the worst because you have to stop and like have like a two to three minute conversation with each person You know, this is one of those things where an irish exit a true irish exit would be like a two-minute escapade
[00:20:32.370] 我觉得这最糟糕了，因为你得停下来，跟每个人聊两三分钟。你知道，这种事，真正的爱尔兰式离开，就像两分钟的速战速决。
[00:20:44.770] But then now it's like a 20-minute exit out the door Oh my god in that scenario. Would you just be like, all right, fuck i'll just hold my pnp at home
[00:20:44.770] 但现在的情况是，出门只需20分钟，我的天哪，在这种情况下，你会不会就想，好吧，算了，我还是待在家里吧
[00:20:53.970] Fuck dude, I feel like we live decently far enough from most places of our friends where it's like not feasible But there's been times where at bars, especially Bar bathroom lines for girls crazy. I'm just like damn. Should I just hold this until I get home?
[00:20:53.970] 妈的，我觉得我们住的地方离大多数朋友住的地方都挺远的，不太可能发生那种事。但有时候在酒吧，尤其是在酒吧里，女生上厕所排队的人多得吓人。我就想，完了。要不我还是憋到回家再说吧？
[00:21:10.770] And you know worst case there's always an option So I have like a random situational question sort of topical since the wedding is coming up, but Would you say that irish exiting at a wedding is rude or do you think it's acceptable? I think it's relatively acceptable
[00:21:10.770] 你知道，最坏的情况总有办法。所以我有个有点跑题的问题，因为婚礼快到了，也算是应景吧？你觉得在婚礼上用爱尔兰式退场（irish exiting）是失礼还是可以接受？我觉得还算可以接受。
[00:21:32.370] especially if it's a big wedding it would take the Bride and groom a long time to get through to everyone and usually they've already put aside certain time to say hi to everyone so I feel like it's kind of normal like, you know,
[00:21:32.370] 尤其是如果是大型婚礼，新郎新娘需要很长时间才能和每个人都打招呼，而且他们通常已经预留了一些时间与每个人问好，所以我认为这很正常，你知道的。
[00:21:48.050] If you're kind of tired now or you're a little too drunk and you feel like you should go home there's no need to bother the host almost
[00:21:48.050] 如果你现在有点累了，或者喝得有点醉了，觉得应该回家了，几乎没必要打扰主人。
[00:21:57.570] Yeah, i'm just imagining the bride and groom trying to have fun and then there's this huge line of people trying to say bye to them Before they leave so I I do think it is not unacceptable to irish
[00:21:57.570] 是啊，我脑补了一下新郎新娘正玩得开心，结果离开前却有一大群人排队跟他们道别的场景，所以我认为这对爱尔兰人来说并非不可接受。
[00:22:12.130] Exit a wedding but you probably want to make sure you interacted with the host at least once. Oh, yeah That's a really good point because even if it's like one Minute per person for like saying goodbye that's already like over an hour if you have more than 100 guests
[00:22:12.130] 参加完婚礼要离开，但你最好确保至少和主人互动一次。哦，对，这一点非常重要，因为即使每人只有一分钟的告别时间，如果宾客超过100人，那也差不多要一个多小时了。
[00:22:29.250] I think that makes total sense it's kind of interesting too because Kind of what I was saying earlier about like oh for me and james like since we're a couple I feel like as long as you say bye to the unit, it's fine
[00:22:29.250] 我觉得这完全说得通，也挺有意思的，因为就像我之前说的，我和詹姆斯既然是情侣，我觉得只要跟单位说再见，就没问题了。
[00:22:41.410] I feel like that can be applied to so many different things where like there's always like a core group of people It doesn't always have to be like romantic But it's just like the host and like their closest like nuclear group of friends
[00:22:41.410] 我觉得这个概念可以应用到很多不同的情境中，比如总会有一个核心圈子。这不一定非得是恋爱关系，但就像主人和他们最亲密的、核心的朋友圈一样。
[00:22:52.610] I feel like as long as you let one of them know that you're leaving. It's like totally fine, right? That's fair. Yeah, if you tell someone you're leaving Also a counterpoint though
[00:22:52.610] 我觉得只要你告诉他们其中一个你要离开，就完全没问题，对吧？这很公平。是啊，如果你告诉别人你要离开……不过也有相反的观点。
[00:23:03.730] When you imagine yourself at your wedding, do you feel like you want to know when every single person leaves no I definitely do not But I guess I would want At least someone at the wedding to know that this person left or something
[00:23:03.730] 当你想象自己参加婚礼时，你会不会很想知道每个人离开的时间？我绝对不会。但我猜我至少希望婚礼上有人知道这个人离开了之类的。
[00:23:18.770] Like I just don't want people to go unaccounted unless they're like totally fine and stuff But right I just think once you add like alcohol or whatever into the mix It gets a little bit into like the safety territory
[00:23:18.770] 我只是不想让任何人下落不明，除非他们真的完全没事。但我觉得一旦酒精之类的东西混在一起，安全问题就有点棘手了。
[00:23:28.470] But that being said I will not be offended if anyone just leaves the wedding You're like, sorry, um half of you didn't check out I'm like literally at the door
[00:23:28.470] 但话虽如此，如果有人中途离场，我也不会介意。你会说：“不好意思，你们一半人没走。” 我都走到门口了。
[00:23:40.550] Okay, but it's like some people I think I would expect them to say bye like really close friends, right? I would probably want some sort of goodbye, I think And those ones will probably stay till the end. Anyway, that's most likely. Yeah
[00:23:40.550] 好吧，但我觉得有些人，就像很亲密的朋友一样，应该会跟我说再见吧？我大概也希望他们能跟我道别吧。而且这些人大概会一直陪到最后。总之，很有可能就是这样。嗯。
[00:23:55.430] I mean you've gone to a few weddings this year. Have you always said bye to the Bride slash groom before you left? I stayed till the end for one of the weddings and of course I did say bye to her because we were like one of the
[00:23:55.430] 我的意思是，你今年参加了好几场婚礼。你每次离开前都会跟新娘/新郎道别吗？有一次婚礼我一直待到最后，当然也跟她道别了，因为我们关系特别好。
[00:24:07.910] Last people still there For the other two weddings, it was more of an irish exit, but I think we said bye to the parents Oh, that's a good one Yeah So that's you know
[00:24:07.910] 最后还在那里的人。另外两场婚礼，更像是爱尔兰式的告别，但我想我们也跟双方父母道别了。哦，这说得好。是啊，你知道的。
[00:24:18.630] Like part of like that nuclear group where it's like i'm checking out with someone not necessarily like the bride and the groom Right, right. Oh my god. Also, I do think though if you're Family with the person getting married. I don't think you should be Right
[00:24:18.630] 就像那种核心圈子里的成员，我感觉我是在和某个人一起参加婚礼，不一定是新郎新娘。对，对。我的天哪。还有，我觉得如果你和结婚的人是家人，你不应该……对吧？
[00:24:34.630] That's a great point Unless you're like distant family, but I feel like usually if you're family and you're invited you have some closeness there you should probably Check in with at least someone else in the family core family before you leave I
[00:24:34.630] 你说得很有道理。除非你是远房亲戚，但我觉得通常情况下，如果你是亲戚并且被邀请，你们之间应该有一定的亲近感，所以在出发前最好至少和核心家庭成员中的其他人确认一下。
[00:24:51.830] Guess like weddings are a little bit different from the normal party rules But I feel like as we talk through a lot of these exit strategies and whatnot i'm learning that i've like probably come a long way and I think you too as well, but
[00:24:51.830] 我想婚礼和普通派对的规则有点不一样。但我觉得，在我们讨论了很多退场策略之类的事情之后，我意识到自己可能进步了很多，我想你也是。
[00:25:04.790] For me when I first started going to parties or like hangouts in college I guess I wasn't sure what like the proper etiquette was and like now at the tender age of 27
[00:25:04.790] 对我来说，刚开始参加大学聚会或类似的聚会时，我不太确定合适的礼仪是什么，而现在我已经27岁了。
[00:25:14.950] We're like able to sniff out what's normal and what's not and like what's rude and what's not But back then I just didn't know so then I remember I would irish exit a little bit more than I do now and then
[00:25:14.950] 我们好像能分辨出什么是正常的，什么是不正常的，什么是粗鲁的，什么是不粗鲁的。但那时候我根本不懂这些，所以我记得我以前比现在更经常会不自觉地离开。
[00:25:27.510] At most I would just check in with the host, but I wouldn't always say bye to like everyone at the party Yeah I started doing that a little bit more when I noticed that my other friends were kind of doing that
[00:25:27.510] 我最多也就是跟主人打个招呼，不会跟派对上的每个人都道别。嗯，我注意到其他朋友也差不多这么做之后，我也开始稍微多做一些。
[00:25:37.030] Where they would say bye to the host and every single person that they knew at the party like knew well enough Anyway to say bye And I think that's why I started adopting that into my personal exit strategy
[00:25:37.030] 他们会向主人道别，也会向派对上所有认识的人道别，反正大家都知道该怎么道别。我想这就是为什么我开始把这种做法融入到我的个人离场策略中的原因。
[00:25:47.350] But I will say it's like fully learned behavior. It wasn't like natural for me in the first place, you know I see i'm trying to remember What I did in the past
[00:25:47.350] 但我想说，这完全是后天习得的行为。一开始对我来说并不自然，你知道，我现在努力回忆我过去做过的事。
[00:25:58.870] Honestly, I think I just tagged along with whoever I was there with if they said we're leaving we're leaving But I don't necessarily say bye to people Maybe to whoever I was talking to in the moment
[00:25:58.870] 说实话，我觉得我只是跟着当时在场的人走，如果他们说我们要走了，我们就走。但我不一定会跟人说再见，也许只会跟当时正在聊天的人说一声。
[00:26:12.550] And nowadays I don't irish exit too much but I have a couple times recently But I do think I happen to be more involved in like Smaller gatherings so I haven't had to like irish exit too much recently. That makes total sense
[00:26:12.550] 现在我不太常参加爱尔兰式退场仪式了，不过最近也参加过几次。但我认为我最近更多地参与的是小型聚会，所以才没怎么用到这种仪式。这完全说得通。
[00:26:29.990] I think for the most part that's me too but I will say there are times where I go to a gathering and it's like a lot bigger than I thought it would be And big for me is I think starting 30
[00:26:29.990] 我觉得大部分时候我也是这么想的，但我得说，有时候我去参加聚会，规模比我想象的要大得多。对我来说，规模大的事情大概就是30岁了。
[00:26:39.350] It's a little big and then like 40 plus is like this is a big party. Basically last night, I actually went to a Decently big party I said bye to the hosts which I think was the biggest thing and the people that I knew who were at the party
[00:26:39.350] 有点大，四十多人的聚会就挺热闹的。昨晚我去参加了一个规模不小的派对，跟主人道别（我觉得这是最重要的事），也跟在场的熟人告别。
[00:26:52.790] So it was like the perfect timing to just grab my bag and leave so I went to the room that I put my bag in because usually I put it in like the bedroom of one of the hosts
[00:26:52.790] 所以当时的时机刚刚好，我拿起包就走，去了我放包的房间，因为通常我会把包放在房东的卧室里。
[00:27:02.150] And I walk in and there's I kid you not like 12 people sitting in that room And I don't know a single person and I was like, oh my god And my bag is like right next to like the stranger's feet because it's not like a huge bedroom, right?
[00:27:02.150] 我走进去，你绝对想不到，里面竟然坐着12个人！我一个都不认识，当时我就想，我的天哪！我的包就放在陌生人的脚边，因为那不是个很大的卧室，对吧？
[00:27:15.910] So it's just like people are like squished there and I was like Sorry, can I grab my bag? And then someone was like, oh are you guys leaving or something? And it's like I guess they were just being polite So I was like, yeah
[00:27:15.910] 所以当时人挤得慌，我就说，不好意思，我可以拿一下包吗？然后有人问，哦，你们要走了吗？感觉他们只是客气点儿。我就说，嗯。
[00:27:27.510] They're like bye so like this room of 12 people They start waving bye to us and i'm like, oh my god, I don't want to make like this huge commotion I just wanted to like Grab my bag and leave quietly Wait, that's so funny
[00:27:27.510] 他们就像在说“拜拜”，这间12个人的房间里，他们开始向我们挥手告别，我就想，我的天哪，我不想引起这么大的骚动，我只想拿上包悄悄离开。等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:27:41.350] Well, that's 12 new friends for you Okay, I have a funny situation yeah, have you ever seen the host irish exit Oh my god, I have actually I have and you were there too with me I think Oh my god, wait, which one are you thinking of? So
[00:27:41.350] 好了，你现在多了12个新朋友。好吧，我遇到一件挺有意思的事儿，你有没有看过主持人爱尔兰人退出的那集？哦，我的天哪，我看过，而且你当时也和我一起看了。哦，我的天哪，等等，你指的是哪一集？
[00:27:58.710] This time we were at a friend's house and then chill night turned into like a very late night so I think we were there until like 4 a.m Or something like that and then I just remember at like 3 30 we looked around and we were like, oh where's so-and-so
[00:27:58.710] 这次我们去朋友家，本来只是想放松一下，结果玩到很晚，我想我们大概待到凌晨四点左右，然后我记得大概三点半的时候，我们四处张望，然后就问：“哎呀，某某去哪儿了？”
[00:28:13.590] And then he had like gone into his bedroom and he was sleeping And the rest of us were just out there like talking chatting having like the time of our lives That's when we were like, okay, we should probably go
[00:28:13.590] 然后他就回卧室睡觉了，我们其他人还在外面聊天说笑，玩得不亦乐乎。这时我们才想起来，好吧，我们可能该走了。
[00:28:23.830] Oh my god, you're right. I do remember that and there was actually something similar that happened Recently for me as well where I went to this party and the host she doesn't drink that much But it was like kind of a big party
[00:28:23.830] 我的天哪，你说得对。我记得这件事，而且最近我也遇到过类似的事情。我去参加一个派对，女主人平时不怎么喝酒，但那派对规模挺大的。
[00:28:37.990] So she like got pretty drunk and so she just like quietly went to her bedroom and just went to sleep Oh my god, I actually accidentally caught her right before She curled up because I was like, oh if you're about to sleep
[00:28:37.990] 她喝得有点醉了，然后就悄悄地回卧室睡觉了。天哪，我居然在她蜷缩起来之前无意中撞见了她，因为我当时就想，哦，你要是想睡觉的话。
[00:28:52.390] I'm, sorry, but like because she had just put up like really nice decorations in one of her rooms Can I go look at it? And she was like, oh, okay. She like crawls out
[00:28:52.390] 不好意思，因为她刚在其中一个房间里布置了很漂亮的装饰，我可以去看看吗？她就说，哦，好的。然后她就爬了出来。
[00:29:01.190] Like let me show you. Oh, that's so cute. Actually. Yeah, that was really funny because afterwards I was like, oh, i'm Sorry, I just remember to like go to sleep. I won't tell anyone Yeah Dude, there's something so funny about irish exiting in like your own house
[00:29:01.190] 让我给你看看。哦，好可爱。真的。是啊，那真的太搞笑了，因为之后我就说，哦，对不起，我刚想起来该睡觉了。我不会告诉任何人的。是啊，老兄，在自己家里被爱尔兰人撞见真的太搞笑了。
[00:29:16.390] So you're just exiting to your bed. Yeah Literally doing like the full 12 step skincare routine as there's like 40 people in your kitchen. It's so funny I think irish exiting as a host is like extremely acceptable if anything Contrary to irish exiting as a guest
[00:29:16.390] 所以你就直接回床上睡觉了。是啊，你厨房里挤了大概40个人，你却还在做全套12步护肤流程。太搞笑了，我觉得爱尔兰人作为主人离开的方式简直太正常了，跟爱尔兰人作为客人离开的方式完全相反。
[00:29:35.670] Irish exiting as a host is such good host behavior because you're letting everyone still have fun But you're like i'm gonna retire though, right? You guys keep going But like, you know, don't let me stop you Yeah, totally
[00:29:35.670] 爱尔兰人退出主持真是个好习惯，因为你让大家都能继续玩得开心。但你又会想，我要退休了，对吧？你们继续玩下去。但你知道，别让我打断你们。是啊，完全同意。
[00:29:50.390] It actually like means you trust the people that are there to like trust them I mean most people won't like fuck up your shit but it's like you trust them to like drink responsibly and get home safe and Not mess with your things and things like that
[00:29:50.390] 实际上，这就像你信任在场的人，我的意思是，大多数人不会搞砸你的东西，但你信任他们会理性饮酒，安全回家，不会乱动你的东西等等。
[00:30:03.830] And I I can't remember specifically but i'm pretty sure there's been a time where a hosh iris exited Everyone there like cleaned up and then we like all left or something like that. So, you know, sometimes it's not too bad
[00:30:03.830] 我记不太清了，但我很确定有一次，一个叫Hosh Iris的人走了，大家都收拾干净，然后我们也都离开了，大概就是这样。所以，你知道，有时候情况也没那么糟糕。
[00:30:14.790] I mean, that's ideal. I love it when guests help you clean up. Yeah So I feel like I have a little bit more insight now into the irish exit You know what's funny is we had initially talked about this episode concept a couple weeks ago
[00:30:14.790] 我的意思是，那太好了。我喜欢客人帮忙收拾。是啊，所以我觉得我现在对爱尔兰式的退出有了更深的理解。你知道吗，有趣的是，我们几周前就讨论过这期节目的创意了。
[00:30:29.110] And we recently scheduled the episode recording for it and I was like, oh perfect This is slotted right after this like huge party So i'm gonna try my best to irish exit this party and I really did try yesterday
[00:30:29.110] 我们最近安排了这期节目的录制，我当时就想，哦，太好了！录制时间正好安排在这个大型派对之后。所以我打算尽量悄悄离开这个派对，昨天我真的尽力了。
[00:30:41.270] But it didn't work out because I had like a group of people that I came with But this will be on my homework list for the next few months to irish exit a party successfully I think you can do it
[00:30:41.270] 但结果并不理想，因为我当时和一群人一起来的。不过，接下来几个月我会把如何成功地“爱尔兰式退出”派对列入我的学习计划。我觉得你也能做到。
[00:30:53.270] I believe I I won't be offended if you irish exit Like a party I host as long as it's not too early. Yeah, I think if you leave early you should say bye But if it's like never leave early Yeah, that's true
[00:30:53.270] 我觉得如果你像参加我举办的派对那样提前离场，只要不是太早，我不会介意的。嗯，我觉得如果你早退的话应该说声再见。但如果是那种从不提前离场的情况，嗯，那确实如此。
[00:31:06.950] But yeah, if it's in the midst of the chaos, you know, the party's been going on for a while I wouldn't blame anyone for leaving I love that. So this is a psa to all my friends if I irish exit your party in the next few months
[00:31:06.950] 但是，如果是在一片混乱之中，你知道，派对已经持续了一段时间，我不会责怪任何人离开，我喜欢这样。所以，我要给我的所有朋友提个醒：如果我在接下来的几个月里退出你们的派对……
