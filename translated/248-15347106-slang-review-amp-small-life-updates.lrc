[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal Kind of crazy we've been doing this like understanding new slang Segment on the podcast for just about a year and a half now We've gone through a good chunk of words
[00:00:00.050] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。说来也怪，我们做这个播客节目，比如“理解新俚语”这个环节，已经差不多一年半了，我们已经学了不少词汇。
[00:00:25.900] but what's truly fascinating is that some of these words have either evolved or Maybe even disappeared or are still being used just as much as when we first
[00:00:25.900] 但真正令人着迷的是，其中一些词语要么已经演变，要么可能已经消失，要么仍然像我们最初使用它们时那样频繁地被使用。
[00:00:37.480] Discussed them. So we thought it would be fun to look back on the words that we've talked about and do a kind of award Ceremony slash superlatives for these slang words. So we wrote down some
[00:00:37.480] 我们讨论过这些词。所以我们觉得回顾一下我们讨论过的词汇，并为这些俚语举办一个颁奖典礼/评选最佳词汇的活动会很有趣。于是我们写下了一些。
[00:00:50.700] Superlatives slash awards to hand out. So the first one we wrote down is The fastest to die aka the one-hit wonder Okay, so I'm looking at our little list of slang words that we've covered and I feel like one that sticks out to me for this is
[00:00:50.700] 各种最高级形容词/奖项要颁发。我们写下的第一个是“死得最快的人”，也就是昙花一现的歌手。好的，我看着我们之前学过的俚语小列表，我觉得有一个词特别突出，那就是……
[00:01:10.940] Ageable which was I just burst out laughing Right, and I feel like cuz this one started almost as an averse reaction to Millennials saying lol all the time It never really had heart and soul in the word. You know what I mean?
[00:01:10.940] “Ageable”这个词，我刚才真的笑喷了。对，我觉得这个词的出现几乎是对千禧一代动不动就说“lol”的一种反感，因为它本身就缺乏真情实感。你明白我的意思吗？
[00:01:24.240] It was just like a response to our lol usage. Yeah, so I think ageable is definitely a one-hit wonder No one uses it anymore And I remember when we discussed this one
[00:01:24.240] 这就像是对我们之前用“lol”这个词的回应。是啊，所以我觉得ageable绝对是昙花一现，现在没人用了。我还记得我们讨论过这个。
[00:01:33.000] We were like not even sure if it's a real slang word or if it was just some decoy to like throw off the Millennials exactly another one-hit wonder is probably understood the assignment
[00:01:33.000] 我们当时甚至不确定这到底是不是个真正的俚语，还是只是个用来迷惑千禧一代的障眼法，就像另一个昙花一现的歌手可能已经理解了这项任务一样。
[00:01:47.760] I don't think I see that one around as much anymore and it's also very fitting for this category because It was originally from a song, right? True. So it actually is a one-hit wonder. Yeah, is there even like a replacement for understood the assignment?
[00:01:47.760] 我觉得现在很少看到这个词了，而且它也很符合这个类别，因为它最初是一首歌里的词，对吧？没错。所以它确实是一首昙花一现的热门歌曲。是啊，还有什么词可以替代“理解了任务”吗？
[00:02:03.860] I guess it's just like eight. Yeah Which is way more succinct and way more emphatic so I think eight is a good substitute. Yeah, okay So another superlative which is kind of similar is you had to be there
[00:02:03.860] 我想它就像“八”一样。是的，这样更简洁有力，所以我认为“八”是个不错的替代词。好的。另一个类似的最高级形容词是“你必须亲身经历”。
[00:02:19.880] So maybe not like a one-hit wonder but it had its moment but now it's like not as applicable Okay, this one. I feel like the gritty so the gritty is Similar to understood the assignment tied to like a specific dance
[00:02:19.880] 所以也许它不是昙花一现，但它也曾风靡一时，只是现在不太适用了。好吧，这个。我觉得它很接地气，所以它的接地气类似于理解与特定舞蹈相关的任务。
[00:02:36.040] So then I feel like when this word was super popular or at least the dance was super popular It was like all I could see everywhere on tik-tok Instagram Twitter, etc
[00:02:36.040] 所以我觉得，当这个词或者至少是这种舞蹈非常流行的时候，我在TikTok、Instagram、Twitter等等社交媒体上到处都能看到它。
[00:02:45.640] And it was so good like you really truly just had to be there in that era that was like the funniest shit ever. Oh My god, okay. I think I have a word for this one as well
[00:02:45.640] 太棒了，你真的必须亲身经历那个时代，那简直是史上最搞笑的事。我的天哪，好吧。我想我也该用一个词来形容一下。
[00:02:57.360] Bombastic side-eye. Oh true. I guess this one could also feel one-hit wonder but I think it blew up Exponentially for a bit similar to the gritty. It was kind of everywhere for a bit now It's like not used at all and and it was a sound bit
[00:02:57.360] 夸张的斜眼。哦，确实。我觉得这首歌也可能像昙花一现，但我认为它像《Gritty》一样，曾一度爆红。它曾经风靡一时，现在却几乎无人问津，而且当时还挺火的。
[00:03:13.060] So I think that's like partially why it was so viral So it's kind of like if you never heard the sound bit, you know, you had to be there
[00:03:13.060] 所以我觉得这在一定程度上解释了它为什么会如此火爆。就好像如果你没听过那段音频，你就得亲身经历才能明白。
[00:03:22.060] Okay now I'm thinking maybe if a word or like a slang word is really tied to like an audio and maybe that's what Makes it super popular but also causes its downfall because girl dinner
[00:03:22.060] 好吧，我现在在想，也许某个词，或者像俚语之类的词，真的和某种音频联系在一起，这或许就是它超级流行但同时也导致它衰落的原因，比如“女孩晚餐”。
[00:03:34.700] Also blew up it was like everywhere for me like two weeks three weeks and then suddenly I feel like I haven't heard that phrase In months, that's true. It did crash and burn You just had to be there Dang and girl dinner was a good one
[00:03:34.700] 也火了，感觉到处都在传，大概两周三周吧，然后突然感觉好几个月都没听到这句话了，真的。它确实彻底崩盘了。你得亲身经历才能体会。哎，还有，那顿晚餐真不错。
[00:03:51.180] I'm sad to sound go I guess that would kind of evolved to like girl math or now It's like a slightly different format, but you know, it's not really referenced anymore. Yeah. Okay. What about the category of
[00:03:51.180] 我很遗憾，我猜它后来演变成了类似“女生数学”之类的东西，或者现在的形式略有不同，但你知道，它已经不再被提及了。是的。好的。那么这个类别呢？
[00:04:05.980] So good, it became classic like now it's just like a part of our daily vocabulary or we still stand around often I think this one has to be the left no crumbs slash eight
[00:04:05.980] 太棒了，它都成经典了，现在就像是我们日常用语的一部分，或者我们仍然经常说这句话。我觉得这句话应该是“Left No Crumbs / Eight”。
[00:04:17.300] I think left no crumbs is actually not used as much. It's more just like they ate right? Yeah that one I feel like Gradually grew more and more in popularity
[00:04:17.300] 我觉得“不留面包屑”这种说法其实用得不多。更多的是像“他们吃完了”这种说法，对吧？嗯，我觉得这种说法逐渐变得越来越流行了。
[00:04:28.740] I think eight as we discussed earlier. It has taken over a bunch of these words that aren't really used anymore So we were saying earlier like understood the assignment you can replace that with eight another one I'm thinking of is like sleigh. Oh, yeah totally replaced by eight
[00:04:28.740] 我觉得就像我们之前讨论过的，用“八”来代替很多现在不太常用的词。比如我们之前说的“理解了作业”，你可以用“八”来代替。我想到的另一个例子是“雪橇”。哦，对，完全被“八”取代了。
[00:04:48.380] Dude okay that one. I actually still can't stop saying I'm in like sleigh rehab Okay, dead ass I think it's also a classic to me this is almost not even slang it's like a real word
[00:04:48.380] 哥们儿，好吧，就是那个。我到现在还忍不住说“我好像在戒酒康复中心”。说真的，我觉得这对我来说也是个经典，这几乎都不算俚语了，它就像个真正的词。
[00:05:06.260] That's how much I use it. It's also been around for a long last time. That's true Yeah, like we can't we can't truly say it was just Gen Z
[00:05:06.260] 我就是这么频繁地使用它。而且它已经存在很久了。没错，就像我们不能说它仅仅是Z世代的专属。
[00:05:15.020] I think it's like, you know a little bit of millennial in there and I think it's not too affected by time If you were to say sleigh now, maybe people would be like, oh that's like outdated
[00:05:15.020] 我觉得它有点像千禧一代的风格，而且我觉得它不太受时间的影响。如果你现在说“雪橇”，人们可能会说，哦，那都过时了。
[00:05:27.180] But if you were to say dead ass, I think no one would straight-up say like that word is outdated Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, maybe cuz it never hit. Well, I don't know I feel like at the peak of dead ass popularity
[00:05:27.180] 但如果你用“dead ass”这个词，我觉得没人会直接说它过时了。嗯，是啊，也许是因为它没流行起来。好吧，我不知道，我觉得“dead ass”这个词最流行的时候是……
[00:05:39.300] It definitely was an overused word because I was gonna say that's what pushes a word into like cringe territory almost which Causes its downfall is when it's like overused I like dead ass at its peak was overused but it still somehow cemented itself into like regular vocabulary word
[00:05:39.300] 这绝对是个被滥用的词，因为我本来想说，正是滥用让一个词变得让人觉得尴尬，也正是滥用导致了它的衰落。我敢说，“desad ass”这个词在其鼎盛时期就已经被滥用了，但它仍然以某种方式巩固了其作为常用词汇的地位。
[00:05:56.900] Agreed. Oh my god, speaking of like sleigh and dead ass. You said that you can't stop saying sleigh still So besides sleigh, is there any other ones that it's like I just can't stop using this language Someone saved me from the word sleigh Okay, mewing
[00:05:56.900] 同意。我的天哪，说到“雪橇”和“死屁股”之类的词。你说你还是忍不住要说“雪橇”。除了“雪橇”之外，还有其他什么词让你忍不住要用吗？有人救了我，让我摆脱了“雪橇”这个词。好吧，喵喵叫。
[00:06:19.740] Hmm and in its category like looks maxing and mogging I know this is a word that came around more recently, but I feel like I still am using this one pretty constantly That's fair. It kind of tows the line between like cringe
[00:06:19.740] 嗯，就外观搭配和幻化这类词来说，我知道“幻化”这个词是最近才出现的，但我感觉自己还是经常用到它。这倒也说得通。它有点像是在尴尬和……之间摇摆不定。
[00:06:36.340] It's like a very I'm online 24-7 kind of a word, but I feel like if you're self-aware about it, it's like so funny Yeah, it's definitely one of those people are using it ironically so much that it's an ironic I think one that I use a lot is
[00:06:36.340] 这个词听起来就像是那种“我一天24小时都在线”的典型用语，但我觉得如果你能意识到这一点，就会觉得特别搞笑。没错，这绝对是那种很多人反讽地使用它的词之一，以至于它本身就带有一种反讽意味。我觉得我经常用的词是……
[00:06:56.940] Molding is one. I think that one still continues to be funny And I think I also use a lock-in. Oh true Yeah I think as lock-ins very applicable and I think it's also good for if you're like with a bunch of people and maybe you're playing
[00:06:56.940] 捏合就是其中之一。我觉得这个梗现在依然很有趣。而且我觉得我还会用锁定机制。哦，没错。我觉得锁定机制非常适用，而且我觉得如果你和一群人一起玩游戏，它也很好用。
[00:07:12.780] Like party games or something. You're like, hold up. Let me like lock in I Think even last night we were like hanging out with a bunch of people playing some sort of stupid video game and
[00:07:12.780] 就像那种派对游戏之类的。你会想，等等。让我想想，我觉得昨晚我们还和一群人一起玩某种很傻的电子游戏，
[00:07:25.780] After a certain point of losing everyone leans forward with like the controller in hand and we're all like, okay lock it All right, so I already know what word is gonna be in this category But this next category is called killed by Millennials
[00:07:25.780] 输了一段时间后，大家都会手握游戏手柄向前倾，然后说：“好了，锁定目标。” 好吧，我已经知道这个类别里要用哪个词了。但下一个类别叫做“被千禧一代杀死”。
[00:07:45.900] Dude slays in a lot of these categories It's hurting my feelings for real Okay, I think also though what could fall into this is like itch Bowl Because that was potentially a trap set for Millennials. Anyway, oh my god era And it's giving
[00:07:45.900] 这哥们儿在好几个方面都碾压全场，真的让我有点儿难过。好吧，我觉得还有一点，就像“痒痒碗”（itch Bowl）一样，因为那可能是给千禧一代设的陷阱。总之，我的天啊，这时代真是太棒了！
[00:08:06.860] Both I think fall into this category of killed by Millennials Oh, I can totally see that cuz it's giving is like it's not really used anymore. Yeah. Well, I still use it But unfortunately, I'm a millennial
[00:08:06.860] 我觉得它们都属于被千禧一代淘汰的那一类。哦，我完全能理解，因为它给人的感觉就像是已经没人用了。是啊。嗯，我还在用。但很不幸，我是个千禧一代。
[00:08:21.380] Or I guess what I mean is I don't see it as much on like tick-tock and stuff now Maybe I hear it more in real life now. Oh, that's true. So it's like that transition from like young
[00:08:21.380] 或者我的意思是，我现在在TikTok之类的平台上不太常见到这种说法了。也许我现在在现实生活中听到得更多了。哦，确实如此。所以这就像是年轻时那种转变。
[00:08:33.780] Online people to like in real life people who are similar to myself I mean, I feel like it's giving an era and Slay maybe live in this category because it's like the gateway drug of slaying
[00:08:33.780] 网络上喜欢的人，现实生活中喜欢和自己相似的人，我的意思是，我觉得这代表了一种潮流，而Slay可能就属于这一类，因为它就像是通往Slay的入门毒品。
[00:08:49.500] It's way easier to make a it's giving joke or like an era joke than to make a looks maxing joke Or like a giga chat joke
[00:08:49.500] 讲一个关于“给予”的笑话或者一个时代笑话比讲一个关于“外观最大化”的笑话或者一个关于“巨型聊天”的笑话容易得多。
[00:08:58.300] Yeah, and these were like easier to understand yeah, it was like oh we can catch on to this like the slayings not getting too crazy yet Yeah, and it's like business casual like work professional. You can make a slay joke at work. But if you were like, yeah
[00:08:58.300] 对，这些更容易理解，感觉就像“哦，我们能明白这个梗，还没到太疯狂的地步”。对，而且是商务休闲风，工作场合的正式着装。你可以在工作场合开个玩笑。但如果你觉得，嗯……
[00:09:16.580] You would not it would not be looked upon well, you'd get some weird looks Okay, I have a funny one for this category the millennial pause So I think this still exists for sure and people still call it out sometimes but
[00:09:16.580] 你不会这么做，这不会被人看好，你会收到一些异样的目光。好吧，我这里有个关于千禧一代停顿的有趣例子。所以我认为这种现象肯定仍然存在，而且人们有时仍然会指出这一点。
[00:09:33.420] Because Millennials hated getting called out on it so much They like practiced so that way less people do the millennial pause now in their videos I also wonder because the millennial pause we talked about it maybe last year or so
[00:09:33.420] 因为千禧一代非常讨厌被指出这一点，所以他们刻意练习，这样现在很少有人在视频里出现“千禧停顿”。我还在想，我们大概在去年讨论过“千禧停顿”这个梗。
[00:09:48.060] But the whole like making fun of millennial thing was big during kovat and like a couple years before that But now Gen alpha which is the generation after Gen Z or at that age where they're like chronically online posting stuff on tik-tok
[00:09:48.060] 但嘲笑千禧一代这种风潮在《Kovat》时期以及之前几年很盛行。而现在，Z世代之后的阿尔法世代，或者说Z世代之后的那个年龄段的人，他们整天泡在网上，在TikTok上发布各种东西。
[00:10:02.980] They're the ones kind of shaping and forming slaying true. So then now I feel like Gen Z doesn't hold the power Oh, I see. So like Gen Alpha doesn't care about the millennial pause Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're probably shitting on Gen Z now
[00:10:02.980] 他们才是真正塑造和形成“杀手级”潮流的人。所以现在我觉得Z世代没有权力了。哦，我明白了。所以就像阿尔法世代不在乎千禧一代的停滞期一样。是啊，是啊，是啊，他们现在可能正在嘲笑Z世代呢。
[00:10:16.940] Wait, that's true. They're probably like what fuck is Gen Z saying? Okay, I always forget that actually a lot of Gen Z people are Graduated from college. They're like working now. Yeah, they're like not that far from us
[00:10:16.940] 等等，确实如此。他们可能在想：Z世代到底在说什么鬼话？好吧，我总是忘记其实很多Z世代都大学毕业了。他们现在都在工作了。是啊，他们离我们其实并不远。
[00:10:30.540] Gen alpha is like the kids that are in high school and and stuff, right? Yeah, I think they're probably like teenagers or something like that. They're the ones leading the scabby Revolution oh my god, their slang is truly edging on gibberish
[00:10:30.540] Gen Alpha 就像那些上高中的孩子，对吧？嗯，我觉得他们大概是青少年之类的。他们领导着这场粗俗的革命，我的天，他们的俚语简直就是胡言乱语。
[00:10:47.340] Okay, well that brings us to slang that has evolved beyond comprehension Okay, I think for this one my mind goes to yeah, I was kind of thinking that too Right because this one was first introduced to us with some sort of meaning about like someone's but basically
[00:10:47.340] 好的，这就引出了那些已经演变得令人难以理解的俚语。嗯，说到这个，我想到的是……嗯，我也有点这么想。没错，因为这个词最初出现的时候，大概是指某人的……但基本上……
[00:11:07.460] And I feel like that's fairly straightforward But sometimes on videos on tik-tok I see like young kids using the term Young kids using the term and I'm like, okay. I thought I knew what this meant
[00:11:07.460] 我觉得这应该很简单明了。但有时候在TikTok视频里，我看到一些小孩子用这个词，我就想，好吧，我以为我知道它的意思。
[00:11:19.460] But now the way you're using this I don't know if I really know what this means anymore agreed agreed It's sometimes I'm like wait, did I misunderstand? And I think it's also interesting cuz like Riz Was kind of like a slang word that's adjacent to Gyaat
[00:11:19.460] 但现在你这样用，我都不知道它到底是什么意思了，同意，同意。有时候我会想，等等，我是不是理解错了？我觉得这很有意思，因为 Riz 就像是 Gyaat 的一个俚语。
[00:11:36.660] Mm-hmm if slang words could have categories like these two would fall in the same category Do you know what I mean? Yeah Yeah But I think Riz has kind of died down a bit but Gyaat's only gotten more and more powerful so like in a way
[00:11:36.660] 嗯，如果俚语也能分类的话，这两个词应该属于同一类。你明白我的意思吗？是啊是啊。不过我觉得Riz现在有点儿冷清了，但Gyaat却越来越火，所以某种程度上来说……
[00:11:55.300] Gyaat has like overtaken Riz and in some context is almost like interchangeable with it And so I mean, I don't even know because as you said this slang word has evolved beyond comprehension dude, I think Gyaat and
[00:11:55.300] Gyaat 已经超越了 Riz，在某些语境下几乎可以和它互换使用。所以，我的意思是，我也不知道，因为正如你所说，这个俚语已经发展到令人难以理解的地步了。我觉得 Gyaat 和
[00:12:11.500] Riz and a couple other slang words that we like mentioned in this conversation. So like Skibbity, for example and also like Ohio and like nervous shit, you know, like all the words that go into those kind of like parody slang songs
[00:12:11.500] Riz 和我们在这次谈话中提到的其他一些俚语。比如 Skibbity，还有 Ohio，以及 nervous shit，你知道，就是那些会出现在类似恶搞俚语歌曲里的词。
[00:12:26.740] Mm-hmm. I feel like live in its own universe and The way kids use them nowadays it truly confounds me I'm like, are they just trying to be ironic and be like, oh look at all this crazy slang
[00:12:26.740] 嗯哼。我觉得它们就像生活在另一个世界里，现在的孩子们用这些词的方式真的让我很困惑，我就想，他们是不是想讽刺一下，然后说，哦，看看这些疯狂的俚语！
[00:12:39.780] Like you adults won't ever be able to figure it out or whatever Or does it truly mean something in their like vocabulary because the sentences that they come up with I'm like what the fuck
[00:12:39.780] 好像你们这些大人永远也搞不懂似的。还是说这在他们的词汇里真的有什么含义？因为他们造出来的句子我都觉得莫名其妙。
[00:12:52.100] Dude I don't know because back in the day like our slang made sense to us So I have a feeling that like their slang probably makes sense to them. Yeah sadly I feel like our most complex slang back then was like YOLO Wait, you're absolutely right
[00:12:52.100] 老兄，我也不知道，因为以前我们说的俚语我们自己都能听懂，所以我感觉他们的俚语他们自己可能也能听懂。唉，可惜的是，我觉得我们以前最复杂的俚语就是“YOLO”了。等等，你说得对。
[00:13:18.400] Wow, yeah, I'm trying to think if we ever had any complicated slang. Oh my god I maybe our most complicated one was ruffle a mouth or like ruffle copter, you know Yeah Okay, actually to be fair
[00:13:18.400] 哇，是啊，我在想我们以前有没有用过什么复杂的俚语。我的天，我们最复杂的俚语可能就是“ruffle a mouth”或者“ruffle copter”之类的，你知道的。好吧，其实公平地说，
[00:13:33.520] Ruffle copter does it that is actually kind of gibberish true. Only the first half is like real The copter part was totally gibberish Although we had like lit but I guess like honestly that's not confusing once you get it. It's like, okay something is like Exciting
[00:13:33.520] “Ruffle copter does it”其实有点像胡言乱语，真的。只有前半部分还算靠谱，直升机那部分完全是胡言乱语。虽然我们好像也理解了，但说实话，一旦你明白了，就不会觉得困惑了。就像，好吧，这感觉很刺激。
[00:13:56.640] Right, and it's like it's like a word that's universal almost. Yeah, it's like a real word actually That's true, too But I will admit lit might be confusing because of its multiple definitions. Oh
[00:13:56.640] 对，它就像一个几乎通用的词。是啊，它确实像个真正的词。没错。但我得承认，“lit”这个词可能有多重含义，所以可能会让人困惑。哦
[00:14:09.720] There's multiple definitions. Yeah, because lit can mean like, you know, something's very exciting like this party's lit, right? But you could also be like I'm lit and that means like I'm drunk Oh true and in like gaming context
[00:14:09.720] 这个词有很多种解释。是啊，因为“lit”可以表示很兴奋，比如“这个派对真嗨”，对吧？但你也可以说“I'm lit”，意思是“我喝醉了”。哦，对，在游戏语境里也是这样。
[00:14:24.800] You could say like I'm lit and that means you're like low health. You're like damaged What did not even know this last one? That's true. Maybe so that's like cooked because we talked about how
[00:14:24.800] 你可以说我“亮了”，意思是你的生命值很低，就像受伤了一样。什么？你甚至不知道最后这个意思？确实如此。也许就像煮熟了一样，因为我们讨论过如何
[00:14:37.400] Cooked and let him cook like all of these things kind of mean slightly different meanings. So I can totally see that Yeah All I'm saying is I feel like our slang back in the day is googleable
[00:14:37.400] “Cooked”和“let he cook”这些词的意思都略有不同。所以我完全能理解。是的，我只是想说，我觉得我们以前的俚语现在都能在网上搜到。
[00:14:50.680] It's like you hear it once you might be like what and then you google it and you're like, oh I see What's up, like yeah and scabby I feel like I've googled for like 20 minutes out of time and I'm like, I still don't know what this means
[00:14:50.680] 就像你第一次听到这个词，可能会一脸懵，然后上网搜一下，才恍然大悟：“哦，原来是这样啊。” 感觉我好像花了二十分钟谷歌搜索，结果还是不知道这是什么意思。
[00:15:00.200] Like we're reading essays on them. I Think another one that's like evolved beyond comprehension Actually, I have two for this one one is Sigma but as we discussed when we first discussed it It was already beyond our comprehension
[00:15:00.200] 就像我们在读关于它们的文章一样。我觉得另一个已经发展到难以理解的地步了。实际上，关于这一点我有两个例子，一个是Sigma，但正如我们第一次讨论它时所说，它就已经超出了我们的理解范围。
[00:15:17.160] Not much to add on there, but I think look smacks sing and mewing has evolved Maybe not beyond comprehension straight up But it's definitely evolved because when we first discussed to mewing it was literally an act right like it was like an action
[00:15:17.160] 没什么要补充的，但我认为“看、拍、唱”和“舌位训练”已经发展演变了。也许还没到完全无法理解的地步，但它肯定是在发展演变的，因为我们最初讨论“舌位训练”的时候，它实际上是一种行为，就像一个动作一样。
[00:15:35.200] But now mewing just means like good-looking or something Or like trying to be good-looking, yeah Yeah, so I'm like, oh so the definition legitimately like changed a bit there It is no longer the action that it originated from it is like a descriptor word almost
[00:15:35.200] 但现在“mewing”的意思就变成了“好看”之类的，或者说是“努力让自己好看”，对，所以我觉得，哦，它的定义确实发生了一些变化。它不再指代最初起源的动作，而更像是一个描述词了。
[00:15:53.360] And I feel like the tapping of the jaw and like the lining of it Oh, you know up even further than when we had first discussed it
[00:15:53.360] 我感觉下巴的轻敲，还有下巴的内衬，哦，你知道，甚至比我们最初讨论的时候还要高。
[00:16:00.280] Mm-hmm in the beginning that was kind of just like the chart or like the graphic that came with like the term mewing So then sometimes people would pop that in to the meme format
[00:16:00.280] 嗯，一开始那有点像是“舌头抵住上颚”这个词附带的图表或图形。后来，有时人们会把它放到表情包里。
[00:16:09.240] But now I feel like in videos like, you know how our generation when someone points a camera on us We like do a peace sign or something Like the kids nowadays they like tap their jaw. They do Whoa
[00:16:09.240] 但现在我觉得，在视频里，你知道我们这代人被拍到时会比个和平手势什么的，但现在的孩子们却会拍着下巴。他们真的会……哇哦
[00:16:22.880] Also looks maxing which is pretty adjacent to like mewing. I've seen it evolve because I sent you like a Tick-tock earlier today and I also saw another like caption instead of looks maxing it was like
[00:16:22.880] 看起来也快要达到极限了，这跟喵喵叫很像。我看到它进化了，因为我今天早些时候给你发了个滴答声，我还看到另一个标题，不是“看起来快要达到极限了”，而是“
[00:16:37.560] Blank maxing one of the captions. I saw was like a word Guinness maxing out here in Dublin And then the one that I sent you it was like some animation of someone spraying a cockroach
[00:16:37.560] 我看到其中一个标题是空白的。我看到的好像是“吉尼斯啤酒在都柏林达到峰值”之类的。然后我发给你的那个，好像是有人在喷蟑螂的动画。
[00:16:50.440] With perfume by accident instead of like roach killer and then the caption was like roach maxing Okay, that one is easy to follow yeah, but I love seeing the evolution of this
[00:16:50.440] 本来想说用香水而不是蟑螂药，结果误用了，然后配文是“蟑螂杀手”。好吧，这个梗很容易理解，但我喜欢看它演变的过程。
[00:17:06.880] I think like the double X's in the maxing part just makes it so much funnier. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's true That's key. Like it was just maxing with with 1x then it's not the slaying one. No It doesn't make as much sense
[00:17:06.880] 我觉得“maxing”部分用双X标记让它更有趣了。是啊，没错，就是这样。这才是关键。就像之前用1倍速达到上限，那它就不是“slaying”了。不，这样就没那么说得通了。
[00:17:21.520] Roach maxing with 1x like what does that even mean? Like who's laughing not me? But 2x is I'm doubled over All right, how about words that are too niche
[00:17:21.520] 蟑螂用1倍药量就能达到极限，这到底是什么意思？谁在笑？反正不是我。但是2倍药量就意味着我笑得直不起腰。好吧，那那些太小众的词汇呢？
[00:17:35.320] Like maybe we discussed it and like never popped off or it just like stayed very niche. Okay, I feel like this one Mm-hmm. I'm thinking of the word medium And maybe it's because I wasn't in like the right audience for this word
[00:17:35.320] 比如，我们可能讨论过，但一直没火起来，或者它一直停留在很小众的范围内。嗯，我觉得这个词……嗯，我在想“中等”这个词。也许是因为我当时的目标受众不太适合用这个词。
[00:17:48.680] But I don't think I've still seen this word out in the wild. Mm-hmm. So maybe it was Something that I'm not like the intended audience for or it was like a more niche word Mm-hmm. Actually, I agree. I think I haven't really seen this either
[00:17:48.680] 但我好像还没在现实生活中见过这个词。嗯。所以也许它不是目标受众会用到的词，或者它本身就是个比较小众的词。嗯。其实，我同意。我想我也没怎么见过这个词。
[00:18:04.520] but I imagine maybe this word still floats around in like People who are really into fitness me because yeah just as a refresher for our listeners This word is supposed to mean like you wear a size smaller
[00:18:04.520] 但我猜这个词可能还在一些健身爱好者圈子里流传，因为，为了方便听众朋友们回忆一下，这个词的意思大概是“穿小一号的衣服”。
[00:18:18.800] So instead of like if you're normally a medium you wear a small so that you look bigger more buff or whatever But yeah, I think I generally don't see this word at all in the content that I come across
[00:18:18.800] 所以，比如你平时穿中码，为了显得更壮硕、更健壮之类的，就穿小码。但是，我感觉我平时接触到的内容里根本看不到这个词。
[00:18:30.840] Okay, the other one that I am thinking of is for free Mm-hmm. So this one I do see but I feel like it's always only about someone's like feet This is very niche
[00:18:30.840] 好的，我想到的另一个是免费的，嗯哼。这个我看到了，但感觉它总是只跟人的脚有关，这太小众了。
[00:18:42.720] It's like I only ever see it on IG stories or like tick-tock where someone posts a photo and they're like toes are showing in The corner or something and the thing is always like oh for free Yeah, but that's only the context that is ever used
[00:18:42.720] 我好像只在Instagram Stories或者TikTok之类的平台上看到过这种情况，有人发张照片，然后说“脚趾头露在角落里”之类的，然后总是会有人说“哦，免费的”。是啊，但也就仅限于这种语境了。
[00:18:56.200] Yeah, I think that's the most common I see this as well but I have seen like kind of an evolved version of this which is sometimes on tik-tok if I like Come across a really high quality video or maybe it's just like really funny
[00:18:56.200] 是的，我觉得这是最常见的情况。我也见过这种现象，但我还见过一种更高级的版本，有时候会在TikTok上看到，比如偶然发现一些质量很高的视频，或者只是觉得特别搞笑。
[00:19:11.680] Sometimes the comments are like I can't believe tik-tok is free Oh, I have seen that or sometimes it's like oh shoot my bad. I didn't know I was on tik-tok premium I
[00:19:11.680] 有时候评论会说“我简直不敢相信TikTok居然是免费的”，“哦，我知道了”，或者有时候会说“哦，糟糕，我的错。我不知道我开通的是TikTok高级会员”。
[00:19:24.040] Love that. Yeah, so I feel like that has been the evolved form of this but even that is like kind of niche It's like only on specific for example, just really high quality videos
[00:19:24.040] 太棒了。是啊，我觉得这算是它的进化形式了，但即便如此，也还是有点小众。比如，它只适用于特定的内容，比如非常高质量的视频。
[00:19:35.160] That's also just such a funny way of being like I like this video. Yeah, this is tik-tok premium Okay, what about the category? Makes me cringe Cringe I Okay, I do think the gritty makes me cringe a bit but only because I
[00:19:35.160] 这也算是表达“我喜欢这个视频”的一种搞笑方式吧。是啊，这是TikTok高级会员。好吧，那分类呢？让我觉得尴尬。尴尬。好吧，我确实觉得这种粗粝的风格有点让我觉得尴尬，但只是因为……
[00:20:00.520] Personally would never be able to do the gritty But I'm not cringing when other people are doing it I'm just yeah, I'm doing if I'm imagining myself being forced to do it Mmm, I feel like period Period
[00:20:00.520] 我个人绝对做不到那种残酷的场面，但别人做的时候我并不觉得尴尬，只是，如果我想象自己被迫去做，我也会觉得……嗯，感觉就像……（此处省略不雅词汇）
[00:20:14.800] Makes me cringe a little bit, but it's also just not used as much anymore That's so then maybe that's the cringe aspect like the people who still use Some of these words that are phased out or maybe people who don't keep up with like the latest slang
[00:20:14.800] 这让我有点尴尬，不过现在也确实不怎么用了。所以，也许尴尬的原因就在于有些人还在用这些已经过时的词，或者有些人不了解最新的俚语。
[00:20:27.520] so then it's like That's where the cringe comes to like we're moved on. Yeah, we're on this new shit You're like you didn't get the latest edition of slang magazine But I'm still saying slay so Oh Okay, I think pookie is also kind of a cringe one
[00:20:27.520] 所以，尴尬感就来自于此，就像我们已经向前看了。是啊，我们现在玩的是新玩意儿。你好像没看过最新一期的俚语杂志。但我还是会说“slay”，所以……好吧，我觉得“pookie”也挺尴尬的。
[00:20:46.760] But I think it's like inherently supposed to be cringe worthy right and because of that it's funny So I think that one is a little bit dude Imagine me saying pookie to someone
[00:20:46.760] 但我认为它本身就应该让人觉得尴尬，对吧？正因为如此才好笑。所以我觉得这有点……哥们儿，想象一下我对某人说“pookie”的样子。
[00:20:59.600] Dude, but that's like the beauty of the word. You know what? I mean? Like you own the cringe But that doesn't stop me from cringing Yeah, I mean I feel like cringe is sometimes just unexplainable like to me the word valid is very cringe
[00:20:59.600] 老兄，但这就是这个词的妙处所在。你知道吗？我的意思是？就像你拥有那种尴尬感，但这并不能阻止我感到尴尬。是啊，我的意思是，我觉得尴尬有时候就是无法解释，比如对我来说，“有效”这个词就非常尴尬。
[00:21:17.200] Because I feel like it's kind of I don't know we both know you mean like, okay Or like that's fair or something. Like why do we have to say valid?
[00:21:17.200] 因为我觉得这有点像……我不知道，我们都知道你的意思是，好吧，或者说，这很公平之类的。为什么我们非得说“有效”呢？
[00:21:24.440] It seems so unnatural to me, which is what makes it cringe, but I know it's like a legitimate use of the word You've always had a gripe with valid Wait, did I say something like that on the episode we talked about it?
[00:21:24.440] 我觉得这很不自然，所以才让我觉得尴尬，但我知道这就像是对“你一直对有效”这个词的一种合理使用。等等，我是否在我们讨论过这个话题的那期节目里说过类似的话？
[00:21:38.280] Or one of the episodes it got brought up and you're like, yeah, I don't love this one, but whatever Hey, at least I'm consistent. That's true Okay, how about slang words that are like still alive but barely breathing? Oh, okay Loki I fear
[00:21:38.280] 或者在某一集里，有人提到了这件事，你会想，嗯，我不太喜欢这个，但算了。嘿，至少我前后一致。确实如此。好吧，那像“还活着但奄奄一息”之类的俚语呢？哦，好吧，我害怕洛基。
[00:21:58.080] Even though I know it just came up. I feel like it's already on its way out. Yeah a little bit I still see it around for sure, but its usage is Exponentially lower than when it first popped off for that like week or two
[00:21:58.080] 虽然我知道它刚出现不久，但我感觉它已经开始走下坡路了。没错，我还能偶尔看到它，但它的使用率比刚开始火的那一两周要低得多。
[00:22:12.680] It's another one of those quick rise, but even quicker fall And this one hurts a little bit but is blank in the room with us right now I love this format and I think it's so funny
[00:22:12.680] 这又是一次快速崛起，但跌得更快的故事。这次有点让人难过，但此刻我们房间里空无一人。我喜欢这种形式，我觉得它很有趣。
[00:22:25.640] But I do think it's on its way out slash out already. Maybe maybe I still see it So, I don't know like if it's just becoming more niche maybe or if it is like kind of on its way out
[00:22:25.640] 但我确实觉得它正在走向衰落，或者说已经衰落了。也许我还能再看到它，所以，我不知道它只是变得更加小众，还是真的正在走向消亡。
[00:22:39.240] But yeah, it's still so funny when I see it. I Think ik is actually kind of still alive but barely breathing. Oh, yeah Yeah, it had its moment and it was pretty long too But I think nowadays I don't know
[00:22:39.240] 不过，每次看到都觉得好笑。我觉得 IK 其实还活着，只是奄奄一息。哦，对啊，它曾经风光一时，而且持续了很长时间。但我觉得现在……我也不知道了。
[00:22:55.800] Maybe it's just like the content has moved on from like picking at people's icks I did see some like anti ik discourse that came out after the whole like Oh name everyone's icks kind of thing that was talking about how once you like focus on all these minute
[00:22:55.800] 也许只是内容已经不再是揪着别人的隐私不放了。我确实看到过一些反对这种做法的讨论，那是在“列举每个人的隐私”这种风潮过后出现的，讨论的内容是，一旦你专注于所有这些细枝末节，就会发现问题所在。
[00:23:12.520] Things that you don't like about someone that becomes the focus of what you notice about people So then is it even that helpful or productive? I mean granted it's supposed to be like funny and all and it is like acknowledged to be petty
[00:23:12.520] 你注意到别人身上那些你不喜欢的地方，反而成了你关注他们的焦点。那么，这样做真的有用或有意义吗？我的意思是，虽然它可能只是为了搞笑，而且大家都知道这种做法很琐碎。
[00:23:26.080] But is it productive like is it constructive to like focus on people's eggs? Yeah valid But yeah, that makes sense It's probably tiring to constantly pick out the tiny things and I feel like on that one
[00:23:26.080] 但是，把注意力放在别人的鸡蛋上，真的有意义吗？嗯，有道理。没错，这说得通。总是挑剔这些小事可能很累人，我觉得……
[00:23:44.440] People can be savage like the icks that people were saying in the beginning. I felt like we're very fair like oh, yes Treats wait staff rudely and at the end it was like stuff. That's very normal about people Oh my god, like uncontrollable about people
[00:23:44.440] 有些人说话很刻薄，就像一开始那些人说的那些恶心话一样。我觉得我们挺公平的，比如，哦，是的，对待服务员很粗鲁，最后却变成了这样。这在人们身上很正常，我的天哪，简直无法控制。
[00:23:58.120] There was a funny one that was like, oh my god, it's an ick when people wear no-show socks. I Saw one that was like it's such an ick when a guy orders like a vanilla bean Frappuccino Oh my god, and then the comments were like, okay
[00:23:58.120] 有个评论特别搞笑，说“我的天哪，穿隐形袜的人真恶心”。我还看到一个评论说“男生点香草星冰乐也太恶心了，我的天哪”，然后评论区就只有“好吧”之类的。
[00:24:14.560] Like let the men enjoy their vanilla bean Let them be their baby girl selves Exactly Do you have any slang words that are like you're scared to use this in person? Okay, kind of but I feel like it's for good reason. So BFFR be fucking fo real and
[00:24:14.560] 就让男人们享受他们的纯洁吧，让他们做回自己的小宝贝。没错。你有没有什么俚语，是那种你不敢当面说的？好吧，有点，但我觉得这是有原因的。所以，BFFR 是真的，别装了。
[00:24:37.520] Tweaking I think our words that are still very much alive and like in use but to me they just feel like slightly aggressive So it's not words that I feel like super comfortable using in person, yeah, I would say pookie again
[00:24:37.520] 我觉得我们用的那些词虽然仍然很流行，也经常被用，但对我来说，它们感觉有点咄咄逼人。所以，我不太习惯在现实生活中用这些词，嗯，我还是会说“pookie”这个词。
[00:24:57.360] I think pookie to you is valid to me But I love seeing it I love But like me using it, you know questionable. Oh Okay, actually also yacht. I feel like I'm too old to be using words like that
[00:24:57.360] 我觉得“pookie”这个词对你来说也挺合适的，但我很喜欢看到它，真的很喜欢。不过，我自己用这个词，你知道，有点儿奇怪。哦，好吧，其实还有“yacht”（游艇）。我觉得我年纪大了，不应该再用这种词了。
[00:25:15.600] No the times that you have said it in person. I've always died laughing like that shit is so It's more funny when it comes from someone so unassuming. Oh My god that reminds me of like so I don't say the word bitch a lot
[00:25:15.600] 不，是你当面说的那些话。每次我都笑死，因为这种话太搞笑了。尤其是从这么不经意的人嘴里说出来，更让人觉得好笑。我的天，这让我想起……所以我不常说“婊子”这个词。
[00:25:30.840] But sometimes when I say it you like you're always like, oh my god Dude it hits so good I'll have to maintain that power by continuing to use it very very limited
[00:25:30.840] 但有时候我说出来，你就会像，我的天哪，这感觉太棒了，我得继续非常非常谨慎地使用它来保持这种效果。
[00:25:48.920] Well, this is like supply and demand 101. Yeah, the demand is so high because the supply is so at the front Everyone is thirsting for me to say Everyone's just waiting in anticipation for me to say pookie While doing the gritty I I
[00:25:48.920] 嗯，这就像是供需关系入门课。是啊，需求这么高是因为供应太少。每个人都渴望我说，每个人都翘首以盼我说“pookie”，同时做着艰难的……
[00:26:10.560] Think also though mewing looks maxing mogging. I'm like low-key scared to say it in case I say it wrong. Oh Actually, that's a really good point because there's such good words very powerful Potent words, but I feel like if you use it wrong, it goes into cringe category
[00:26:10.560] 不过想想看，用舌头顶住舌头（mewing）看起来是不是有点太夸张了？我其实有点害怕说出来，怕说错。哦，你说的很有道理，因为有些词确实很棒，很有力量，很有感染力，但我觉得如果用错了，就会显得很尴尬。
[00:26:28.240] Then you have to like use it correctly Yeah, I feel that one also Sigma cuz this one as we said beyond our comprehension, so I wouldn't dare use All right last category that we have today What is a word that you wish was still popular and use?
[00:26:28.240] 那么你就得正确使用它。是的，我也觉得Sigma这个词很特别，因为正如我们所说，它超出了我们的理解范围，所以我不敢用。好的，我们今天的最后一个类别是：你希望哪个词仍然流行并被使用？
[00:26:46.680] Okay, this is the I miss you category. Well, I know what yours is The four-letter word, okay, but can I miss it when I use it like 20 times a day? You will single-handedly bring it back into fashion Yes, I will never let go of slay
[00:26:46.680] 好了，这是“我想你”那一类。我知道你想念的是什么——那个四个字母的词，好吧，但我一天要用它20次，还能说想念它吗？你一个人就能让它重新流行起来。没错，我永远不会放弃“slay”这个词。
[00:27:08.880] Bury me with the word slay. I Kind of liked POV Mmm, I felt like those were always quick to understand and like an easy setup for a joke Mmm, although so I still see POV
[00:27:08.880] 用“slay”这个词把我埋葬吧。我其实挺喜欢POV的，嗯，我觉得POV总是很容易理解，而且很容易引出笑话，嗯，虽然如此，我仍然会选择POV。
[00:27:23.800] But I feel like it's one of those words that was overtaken by like the corporate world So I feel like every time I see a video with like POV. It's an ad
[00:27:23.800] 但我感觉这个词已经被商业世界滥用了。所以我觉得每次我看到带有“POV”字样的视频，其实都是广告。
[00:27:33.960] It's like Oh POV you forget to clean your house and then it's like yeah all the cleaning supplies or something I'm like, what the fuck? Yeah, I can totally see how that killed the word Killed by capitalism sad. I also miss girl dinner to be honest
[00:27:33.960] 就像“哦，POV（第一人称视角）你忘了打扫房子，然后突然发现所有清洁用品都用完了”，我就想，搞什么鬼？是啊，我完全能理解为什么“资本主义扼杀”这个词。真可悲。说实话，我也很怀念和闺蜜们一起吃晚餐的时光。
[00:27:51.520] Mmm, such an easy one to use be like, oh my god today like I don't feel like cooking. Let's do girl dinner I I miss that one. I feel like the sound was just very iconic with that one too Satisfying. Mm-hmm, dude. I feel like weirdly
[00:27:51.520] 嗯，用起来真方便，比如，天哪，今天我不想做饭。不如我们女生一起吃晚餐吧。我好怀念这个功能。感觉那个音效也特别经典，很爽。嗯哼，兄弟。感觉有点怪怪的。
[00:28:07.480] nostalgic after doing these Maybe because we see so many of these words online or had seen a lot of this stuff online Not certain periods of time. It does kind of feel like blast from the past a little bit
[00:28:07.480] 做完这些之后，我有点怀旧。也许是因为我们在网上经常看到这些词，或者曾经在网上看到过很多类似的东西，而不是因为某个特定的时期。这确实有点像是回到了过去。
[00:28:21.000] Yeah, some of these are truly like gone and we're looking over them We're like wow, like that was just a year ago. Yeah, like bombastic side. I was crazy. Yeah and
[00:28:21.000] 是啊，有些真的已经消失了，我们看着它们，感觉就像哇，好像才过去一年似的。是啊，就像我以前那种夸张的风格。我当时真是疯了。是啊，
[00:28:33.580] That one holds a special place in my heart because I first learned about it through like some random in a game And they said it they kept saying it to like me and my duo like plastic side eye and we were like what is going on? Me
[00:28:33.580] 那件事在我心中有着特殊的地位，因为我第一次听到它，是在游戏里一个陌生人跟我说的。他们不停地跟我和我的搭档说，我们俩都觉得这是什么意思，当时我们都懵了。
[00:28:49.580] That's like the scariest way to learn slang just like in the wild dude. We literally asked that guy to we're like What does it mean? And he was like, I don't know just means bombastic side Okay Thanks for clearing that up
[00:28:49.580] 这简直是学俚语最吓人的方式了，就像在野外一样。我们当时就问那家伙“这是什么意思？”，他居然说“我不知道，就是夸张的一面”。好吧，谢谢你解释清楚。
[00:29:08.140] Well, hopefully this was as fun for everyone else to listen to as it was for us We'll continue to roll out that slang segment of our podcast so stay tuned for more educational like this in the future, but
[00:29:08.140] 希望大家听得也和我们一样开心。我们会继续在播客中推出俚语环节，敬请期待未来更多类似的科普内容。
[00:29:22.260] Before we wrap up today's episode. We also did want to do a little bit of a life update segment as well We kind of think of this as our like crises like so it's like what's the latest?
[00:29:22.260] 在结束今天的节目之前，我们还想做一小段生活近况更新。我们把这部分看作是我们的“危机时刻”，所以就想问问大家最近怎么样？
[00:29:33.740] Crisis that you have been going through dude. I've definitely been going through a crisis and it's I Think it's like the culmination of just like life and then now I'm at a point where I'm like wait I can't believe I've been doing life like this for
[00:29:33.740] 兄弟，你最近经历的危机真是太糟糕了。我确实经历了一场危机，我觉得这就像是人生的最终阶段，现在我到了一个临界点，我会想，等等，我简直不敢相信我竟然这样生活了这么久。
[00:29:49.380] 20 plus years almost 30 years. I'm having a procrastination crisis To describe it like imagine you're just holding a rope and you know Like you can hold it with no tension or with a lot of tension
[00:29:49.380] 二十多年了，快三十年了。我正经历一场拖延症危机。要形容这种感觉，就像你手里拿着一根绳子，你可以完全不拉紧它，也可以拉得很紧。
[00:30:04.100] And I feel like what happens is like days leading up to a due date or something, you know I'm basically holding this rope. Like my hands are so close together. There's like absolutely no tension and then it's like the day or two days before the deadline and
[00:30:04.100] 我觉得就像临近截止日期的那几天，我就像在拉一根绳子，双手紧紧地握在一起，一点也不紧张。然后，就在截止日期前一两天，
[00:30:20.860] I'm like I pulled this rope like as far apart as I can There's just maximum tension and I'm like, oh my god, I need to like get this done And I'm like I need to regulate this more. I think it's not
[00:30:20.860] 我感觉自己把绳子拉到极限了，张力已经达到极限，我心想，我的天哪，我得赶紧把这事儿办完。然后我又想，我得更好地控制一下。我觉得它还没完。
[00:30:34.060] Productive or healthy to like be constantly going back and forth into these like two extremes Whoa, dude, that visual is crazy. I'm like imagining you with a resistance band or something. Oh my god and I think like one of the
[00:30:34.060] 在这两个极端之间不断来回切换，对健康或有益吗？哇，老兄，这画面太疯狂了。我仿佛看到你拿着阻力带之类的东西。我的天哪，我觉得就像其中一个……
[00:30:48.900] interesting things about this problem is like I'm trying to figure out if it's because I'm too Overwhelmed or if I'm too underwhelmed because you know how it's like if you have some like stress That's good because that'll get you up and like doing things
[00:30:48.900] 这个问题有趣的地方在于，我正在努力弄清楚这是因为我压力过大还是因为压力过小。你知道，如果你有点压力，那其实是好事，因为压力会让你振作起来，去做事。
[00:31:04.700] But if you don't have enough stress, then that will actually lead to not doing things But then if you have like too much stress, then you become like overwhelmed and you also can't do things So I'm like, oh shoot like am I overwhelmed or am I underwhelmed?
[00:31:04.700] 但是，如果压力不够，反而会导致什么事都做不了；而如果压力过大，又会让人不堪重负，什么事也做不了。所以我就想，哎呀，我到底是压力过大还是压力不足呢？
[00:31:18.260] Something needs to change so that I can find a more regular pace, I guess God, I like totally feel that I think even with social plans and stuff, too It's like the weekends where I have back-to-back-to-back plans. I'm so overwhelmed
[00:31:18.260] 我需要做出一些改变，才能找到更规律的生活节奏。天哪，我完全有这种感觉，即使有社交活动什么的，也一样。就像周末，我的日程安排得满满当当，简直忙得不可开交。我感觉压力好大。
[00:31:34.020] I'm like, I don't know why I ever stacked my weekend like this. This is insane So then the next weekend all like shuffle stuff around so I have at least like one or two free days
[00:31:34.020] 我心想，真不知道我当初为什么要把周末安排成这样。简直太疯狂了。所以下个周末我就得重新调整计划，至少留出一两天空闲时间。
[00:31:43.180] Then I feel like on those actual free days. I'm like craving to do something I'm like, oh my god, like maybe I should hit up this person and we'll go out to get lunch or whatever
[00:31:43.180] 然后，到了真正空闲的日子，我就感觉特别想做点什么，比如，天哪，也许我应该联系一下这个人，我们一起出去吃个午饭什么的。
[00:31:50.580] I should have been making more out of this day. So I feel like it is like a constant Do I need more or do I need less? Yeah, so that's been like kind of my big crisis lately
[00:31:50.580] 我本应该让这一天过得更充实一些。所以我感觉自己一直在纠结：我需要更多还是更少？是啊，这几乎成了我最近的一大难题。
[00:32:01.900] I think I'm still kind of adjusting and settling down since I moved recently So I'm still kind of finding my like routine and what works and what doesn't work. Yeah, we'll see Hopefully hopefully something will get solved Yeah, I mean maybe it's like a calibration thing
[00:32:01.900] 我觉得我还在适应和安顿下来，毕竟我最近刚搬家。所以我还在摸索自己的生活规律，看看哪些方法有效，哪些无效。嗯，我们走着瞧吧。希望问题能得到解决。嗯，我的意思是，也许只是需要一段时间来适应。
[00:32:22.740] You know, you're like recalibrating your whole life to make sense in this new way of life And especially with like a new environment and everything and I'm sure you had your whole list of to-dos like for moving specifically, too
[00:32:22.740] 你知道，你就像是在重新调整你的整个生活，以适应这种新的生活方式，尤其是在全新的环境等等方面。我相信你肯定也列了一长串待办事项清单，特别是关于搬家的那些。
[00:32:35.500] Yeah, I can see how it can be a total balancing act. Yeah for sure I think like now that I'm mostly settled there's less of the new home things like Find a bed a mattress Get plates so you can eat and stuff like that
[00:32:35.500] 是啊，我能理解这确实需要权衡。没错，现在我基本安顿下来了，新家需要操心的事情就少了很多，比如找床、床垫、买餐具之类的。
[00:32:54.220] Now it's more like okay. What days should I be going to work? What days should I work from home What days should be the errand day and what day should be like laundry day? So I think we're getting there but in the meantime, I'll be struggling
[00:32:54.220] 现在感觉好多了。我应该哪天去上班？哪天在家办公？哪天是跑腿办事日？哪天是洗衣服日？所以我觉得我们正在慢慢步入正轨，但在此之前，我还会继续挣扎。
[00:33:10.260] Well, I feel you on that. I feel like my whole life I'm always on some sort of procrastination crisis or another so We shall get through it together Although I do have this like weird hope for myself. Maybe that like maybe once I'm a parent
[00:33:10.260] 嗯，我懂你的感受。感觉我这辈子好像总是陷入各种各样的拖延危机中，所以我们一起努力克服吧。虽然我对自己还有点儿奇怪的希望，也许等我当了父母之后，情况就会有所好转。
[00:33:24.780] I'll procrastinate less because it's one thing to procrastinate on your own things Yeah, but I feel like in shared projects or like responsibilities that I have that might affect my husband For example, I've procrastinate a little bit less and then with a kid
[00:33:24.780] 我会减少拖延，因为拖延自己的事情是一回事，但我觉得在共同参与的项目或者我肩负的、可能会影响到我丈夫的责任上，拖延就更难了。比如，有了孩子之后，我拖延的次数就少了一些。
[00:33:39.700] Maybe it'll be even better. Like maybe I don't know more responsibility on your shoulder. Yeah, you're like, oh shoot If I don't do this thing my child might like not be okay. Yeah Well, I don't know
[00:33:39.700] 也许会更好。比如，我不知道，也许你肩上会肩负更多责任。是啊，你会想，糟了，如果我不做这件事，我的孩子可能就不好。是啊，我不知道。
[00:33:52.300] Maybe it's like also when you're a pet owner like you have to step up and like be like a good owner true I completely agree when it's just you it's like oh well the only person who will receive these consequences are myself anyway
[00:33:52.300] 也许就像养宠物一样，你必须承担起责任，做一个好主人。没错，我完全同意。但如果只有你一个人，就会觉得“哦，反正最终承担后果的也只有我自己”。
[00:34:06.500] Yeah, I'm like, it's just me I can do well. How about you? What has your latest crisis been lately? I've been in this crisis where I think a common theme in my life is I like have these feelings and I like have something to say and
[00:34:06.500] 是啊，我就觉得，只有我能做好。你呢？你最近遇到了什么危机？我最近一直处于危机之中，我觉得我人生的一个共同点就是，我有很多感受，也有很多话想说，但是……
[00:34:22.860] Then I like don't say it like I just suppress it inside Things like that I think are especially more common for me and like customer service settings You know when you like order boba and the wrong thing comes out
[00:34:22.860] 然后我就不想说出口，就把它压在心里。我觉得这种事对我来说尤其常见，就像在客服场合一样。你知道那种点珍珠奶茶结果端上来的东西不对的情况吗？
[00:34:34.940] I'm like do I really need it return the drink and like get the correct one back, etc Mm-hmm, so that has been my whole life But recently I'm like, you know what maybe I just need to go full Karen and turn my Karen era
[00:34:34.940] 我当时想，我真的需要那杯饮料吗？把它退回去，换一杯正确的，等等。嗯，这就是我一直以来的生活。但最近我又想，你知道吗，也许我应该彻底变成“凯伦”，开启我的“凯伦时代”。
[00:34:47.420] Put my foot down because two weeks ago I was trying to like order these glasses online a pair for myself and a pair for my husband and We go to this like optometrist office, right? I had sent them an email and was like hey
[00:34:47.420] 我态度坚决是因为两周前我试图在网上订购一副眼镜，一副给我自己，一副给我丈夫。我们去的是一家验光诊所，对吧？我给他们发了邮件，说：嘿
[00:35:01.160] Can you guys send over like our prescriptions because like two months prior we had gone in to get our eye test and we only got A copy of our contact lens prescriptions. So I was like, oh, hey
[00:35:01.160] 你们能把我们的处方发过来吗？因为大概两个月前我们去做了眼科检查，结果只拿到了一份隐形眼镜处方。所以我就想，哦，嗨……
[00:35:10.280] Can you guys email me our glasses prescriptions and then radio silence? I was like, oh, it's fine Maybe they don't check their inbox. So I call them and ask them for it and there she's like, okay
[00:35:10.280] 你们能把眼镜处方发到我的邮箱，然后就杳无音信吗？我想，哦，没关系，也许他们不看邮箱。所以我打电话过去问，她才说，好的。
[00:35:21.380] Like I'll send it to you by end of day. I'm like, oh my god. Thanks so much. Hang up. Nothing comes in I wait like a couple days maybe like three four business days. That's still nothing, right?
[00:35:21.380] 就像我承诺今天结束前发给你一样。我当时就想，我的天哪，太感谢了。然后挂断了电话。结果什么都没收到，我等了大概两三天，也许三四个工作日。那还是什么都没收到，对吧？
[00:35:30.880] So I call again and she's like, oh like yeah, I'll send it by end of day. I'm like, okay Thanks so much. Hang up. Nothing comes in again. So I call for the third time
[00:35:30.880] 于是我又打了一次电话，她回复说，哦，好的，我会在今天结束前发过去。我说，好的，非常感谢。然后挂断了电话。结果还是没有任何消息。所以我第三次打了电话。
[00:35:40.280] This is like one email and three phone calls and this time I'm like, you know I could just do the same thing that I did every time and pretend that it's my first time calling
[00:35:40.280] 这就像一封邮件加三个电话，这次我就想，你知道吗，我可以像以前一样，假装这是我第一次打电话。
[00:35:49.160] I'd be like, oh like do you mind shooting over the prescription by email and be like nice But I was like, this is a little crazy Like yeah I should say something and I was like hey
[00:35:49.160] 我当时会说，哦，你能不能把处方发邮件过来，然后客气点。但我又觉得，这有点儿太离谱了，我应该说点什么，然后我就说，嘿。
[00:35:57.720] Do you think you can help me get a copy of my prescription because I've called a couple times and I've emailed as well But I've just never been able to get any luck getting my prescription in the mail
[00:35:57.720] 您能帮我弄一份处方副本吗？我已经打过几次电话，也发过邮件，但一直没能收到邮寄来的处方。
[00:36:06.600] I'm just like oh so sorry about that. Like I'll send it over right now in like 20 minutes So then I finally got it and I was like, okay My new outlook on life is to be a polite Karen, you know
[00:36:06.600] 我当时就想，哦，真抱歉。然后我就说，我马上就发过去，大概20分钟吧。结果我终于收到了，然后我就想，好吧。我的人生新方向就是做一个有礼貌的“凯伦”，你知道的。
[00:36:17.360] like I don't have to just pretend like nothing has happened to me and Suppress these feelings like I could just politely address the situation and be like hey Can you guys just send this to me ASAP? Like I actually need it
[00:36:17.360] 我不用假装什么都没发生，也不用压抑这些感受，我可以礼貌地处理这件事，比如跟他们说：“嘿，你们能不能尽快把这个发给我？我真的需要它。”
[00:36:29.480] So I am unlocking a new chapter in my life where I actually do say something about these things. Ooh, I like that That's probably better for your mental too. Yeah when you were sharing your story
[00:36:29.480] 所以，我的人生开启了新篇章，我终于可以就这些事情发表一些看法了。哦，我喜欢这样。这可能对你的精神状态也有好处。是啊，当你分享你的故事时。
[00:36:42.160] It was kind of reminding me of that saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me I was like, oh my god, you're about to get fooled the second time
[00:36:42.160] 这让我想起那句谚语：上当一次是你的错，上当两次是我的错。我当时就想，我的天哪，你第二次又要上当了。
[00:36:52.560] Yeah, dude and I think it was like normally this wouldn't stress me out that much But I had also ordered these like blackout blinds for our bedroom to get better sleep for me and my husband Those blinds also came in like non blackout version
[00:36:52.560] 是啊，哥们儿，我觉得平时这事儿不会让我这么焦虑。但我之前还订了些遮光窗帘，想装在卧室里，好让我和我老公睡得更好。这些窗帘也有非遮光款。
[00:37:08.260] So then I was like trying to get this corrected through Customer service with the blinds company who was also being unresponsive and I also had to follow up with them three to four times To even get a replacement
[00:37:08.260] 所以，我当时就试图通过百叶窗公司的客服来解决这个问题，但他们也一直没有回应，我不得不反复催促他们三四次才最终拿到替换件。
[00:37:19.400] So I was like, I need my prescription and I need my blackout blinds and no one wants to give me anything And it was like driving me crazy So I think that's what drove me to unlock this new Karen era of my life
[00:37:19.400] 所以我就想，我需要我的处方药，我需要我的遮光窗帘，但没人愿意给我任何东西。这简直快把我逼疯了。我想，这就是我开启人生新篇章——“凯伦时代”的原因吧。
[00:37:32.600] actually, I was kind of talking about something related to this with a friend and We talked about how like it's okay to be inconvenient Because then you're like truly Expressing your needs Versus like I guess we're so used to being like, oh if it's not doing much trouble
[00:37:32.600] 其实，我之前跟朋友聊过类似的话题，我们谈到，有时候故意制造不便也没什么不好，因为这样才能真正表达自己的需求。而我们现在好像总是习惯性地想：如果没造成什么麻烦就行了。
[00:37:52.800] Can you do this or you know, blah blah blah like we're so used to trying to be more convenient, right? So then I was like damn, I guess that's true Like we should express ourselves more and that's like assertive communication or whatever you want to call it
[00:37:52.800] 你能做到吗？或者你知道，诸如此类，我们总是习惯于追求便利，对吧？然后我就想，哎，看来确实如此。我们应该更多地表达自己，这叫做积极沟通，或者随便你怎么称呼它。
[00:38:08.560] yeah, I feel like that's such a helpful thing to note too because I'm very conscious of my Identity I guess as an Asian American woman, especially a Korean American woman
[00:38:08.560] 是的，我觉得这一点也很有用，因为我非常在意自己的身份认同，我是一个亚裔美国女性，尤其是一个韩裔美国女性。
[00:38:19.040] and I feel like there's all these values that have been instilled in me as a young girl and now that I'm Older I need to unlearn some of these things, you know where I'm always like
[00:38:19.040] 我觉得我从小就被灌输了很多价值观，现在我长大了，需要摒弃其中的一些，你知道，我总是……
[00:38:29.920] Oh, I should be polite at my own expense basically like politeness is one thing But I feel like it shouldn't come like a certain level of self-sacrifice. You know, I am equally a Patient I'm equally a client a paying customer
[00:38:29.920] 哦，我应该出于礼貌而牺牲自己，礼貌是一回事，但我觉得它不应该演变成某种程度的自我牺牲。你知道，我既是病人，也是客户，也是付费顾客。
[00:38:44.680] Just as much as other people are and I don't know why I would have to like forgo certain rights in order to be like the most polite Angel customer or something, you know what I mean?
[00:38:44.680] 就像其他人一样，我不明白为什么为了成为最有礼貌的天使顾客，我就必须放弃某些权利，你明白我的意思吗？
[00:38:55.760] It's just like why am I doing this to myself like at the very basic? I should get some level of service or whatever, you know I'm just trying to listen to my feelings and not just like shove them down
[00:38:55.760] 我就是想问自己，我为什么要这样折磨自己？最根本的问题是，我应该得到一些服务之类的，你知道，我只是想倾听自己的感受，而不是把它们压抑下去。
[00:39:06.160] Prioritize my needs and stuff above all these like social rules that like a web of like social rules that I've entrapped myself in Basically is how I feel sometimes. Yeah, I totally feel that
[00:39:06.160] 把我的需求和事情放在所有这些社会规则之上，这些规则就像一张我把自己困住的网。基本上，我有时候就是这种感觉。是的，我完全有这种感觉。
[00:39:16.840] I think I'm similar to you that like usually if something's slightly wrong, I'm just like, okay. Well, I guess that's life Just fucking take it and I'll eat the wrong order or whatever, right?
[00:39:16.840] 我觉得我和你差不多，通常如果有什么小问题，我就会想，好吧。我想这就是生活吧。就这么算了，就算点错菜什么的，我也照样吃，对吧？
[00:39:28.920] But then yeah, like sometimes it does hit the point where you're like, oh my god Like maybe I should say something about this Okay, actually I have a funny story about this Uh-huh. I fucking had a credit card where my name was spelled wrong
[00:39:28.920] 但有时候，事情确实会发展到那种地步，你会觉得，我的天哪，也许我应该说点什么。好吧，其实我有个关于这事的搞笑故事。嗯哼。我曾经有一张信用卡，上面我的名字拼错了。
[00:39:42.360] I think I had spelled it wrong in my initial application maybe where it was something like Crystal with the a and L swapped so it's like crystal ah Chris law And I just kept using that card for I think like almost a full year
[00:39:42.360] 我想我最初申请的时候可能拼错了，大概是Crystal之类的，a和l弄反了，变成了crystal ah Chris law。然后我就一直用那张卡，大概用了快一年了。
[00:39:59.120] And then I was like, okay, actually I should probably get this Changed way of four years crazy Yeah, and I was like I can't believe I've just been letting myself use this incorrect name for like a full year
[00:39:59.120] 然后我就想，好吧，其实我应该把这四年来的改变方式搞清楚。是啊，我当时就想，我简直不敢相信我竟然整整一年都用了这个错误的名字。
[00:40:12.480] But I finally called them and it was actually so easy to change too and I was like Why didn't I do this sooner? Like what is wrong with me? Oh Man, I totally feel that though. That is definitely something I would do
[00:40:12.480] 但我最终还是给他们打了电话，结果发现更改起来竟然这么容易，我当时就想：我怎么没早点这么做？我到底是怎么了？哎，我完全能理解你的感受。这绝对是我会做的事。
[00:40:23.960] I'm like, is this really that bad and then time passes and I'm like, why did I not get this fixed earlier? Yeah, but I think what really matters is that you're gonna be a polite Karen it's not someone who's I guess like being rude or
[00:40:23.960] 我当时想，这真的有那么糟糕吗？然后时间过去了，我又会想，我为什么没早点解决这个问题？是啊，但我觉得真正重要的是你要做一个有礼貌的“凯伦”，而不是那种粗鲁无礼的人。
[00:40:38.560] Disruptive. I think it's like all well within your rights. Yeah true. I'm unlocking like well, basically I'm trying to get to my normal like level that everyone else is at but to me that's like the Karen level
[00:40:38.560] 扰乱秩序。我觉得这完全是你的权利。没错。我正在努力恢复，基本上，我只是想回到大家正常的水平，但对我来说，那就像“凯伦”的水平。
[00:40:51.380] So it's my Karen era, but maybe I'm just learning to be normal for the first time in my life I feel that I feel that we should all embrace some of our inner Karen She deserves love too. Yeah Well, this was a fun episode
[00:40:51.380] 所以现在是我的“凯伦时代”，但也许我只是生平第一次学习如何做个正常人。我觉得我们都应该接纳自己内心深处的“凯伦”，她也值得被爱。嗯，这集挺有意思的。
[00:41:07.560] I think it was pretty fun to like look through a Lot of the slang words that we've talked about before and also always fun to catch up on each other's crises I feel like usually the crisis that I'm going through and the one that you're going through is
[00:41:07.560] 我觉得回顾一下我们之前讨论过的很多俚语挺有意思的，而且聊聊彼此遇到的麻烦事也总是很有趣。我觉得通常我遇到的麻烦事和你遇到的麻烦事是……
[00:41:23.640] Very relatable, but it's just like at the moment your crisis and not mine And then maybe next time it's like it'll be my crisis, but not yours Very true So for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts on favorite slang words or similar crises as us
[00:41:23.640] 非常有共鸣，但感觉就像此刻是你的危机而不是我的。也许下次就变成我的危机而不是你的了。确实如此。所以，各位听众朋友们，如果你们有什么喜欢的俚语或者和我们类似的危机经历，欢迎分享。
