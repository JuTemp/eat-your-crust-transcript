[00:00:00.240] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. I think we need to talk about our dreams and ambitions. I don't know about you, but I feel like as we get older, our dreams, goals and stuff are starting to change.
[00:00:00.240] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。我觉得我们需要聊聊我们的梦想和抱负。不知道你们有没有这种感觉，但我感觉随着年龄的增长，我们的梦想、目标等等都会开始发生变化。
[00:00:28.610] And I think at this current age, it's starting to really show, in my mind at least. We thought it would be fun to chat about our dreams and ambitions at this current life stage. Do you have any particular dreams, ambitions, goals that come to mind? Yes and no. So I feel like in the last five years, my dreams and ambitions, like you said, have really changed.
[00:00:28.610] 我觉得到了我这个年纪，这种感觉真的开始显现出来了，至少我是这么觉得的。我们觉得聊聊我们在这个人生阶段的梦想和抱负会很有意思。你有什么特别的梦想、抱负或目标吗？算是吧，也不算。我觉得过去五年里，我的梦想和抱负，就像你说的，真的发生了很大的变化。
[00:00:58.630] And one of the most distinctive changes that I can see is, I think when I used to think about dreams and ambitions when I was a younger kid, it used to be more career focused. Like I wanted to have this kind of job and I wanted to be making this much money. And I think like half of my dreams and ambitions as a child was about what kind of office I would have. Oh my God. Like an office in a high rise, private room, like that kind of thing.
[00:00:58.630] 我发现最显著的变化之一是，我小时候的梦想和抱负更多地集中在事业上。比如，我想拥有这样的工作，想赚这么多钱。我觉得我小时候一半的梦想和抱负都和我想要什么样的办公室有关。天哪，比如高层建筑里的办公室，带独立隔间的那种。
[00:01:26.170] But I don't know if it's like my hormones or something or just being like in my late 20s post-marriage now. But I feel like my biggest dream is to just have like a very happy, tiny little like nuclear family. Which sometimes I think about it, I'm like, my dream is setting back feminism by like three decades. But also at the same time, like that's just what I want. Like that's like what I want the most for myself and my life. I mean, I feel like that's very normal.
[00:01:26.170] 但我不知道这是不是荷尔蒙作祟，还是因为我快三十岁了，结婚之后就有了这种感觉。我觉得我最大的梦想就是拥有一个非常幸福、温馨的小家庭。有时候我想，我的梦想是不是让女权主义倒退了三十年？但同时，这又正是我想要的。这大概是我对自己和人生的最大期盼吧。我觉得这很正常。
[00:01:55.890] Like some guys also have that dream to have a kid and to have a happy family. And I think it's a very natural want. What do you think is the most exciting about having a family? Yeah, that's a good question. The way I see it, the family is the fundamental life experience for me. That's like my base unit, you know. I almost see myself as like someone who's a part of a family. That's why the family experience is so important to me.
[00:01:55.890] 就像有些人也梦想着拥有孩子和幸福的家庭一样。我觉得这是很自然的愿望。你觉得组建家庭最令人兴奋的是什么？嗯，问得好。在我看来，家庭是我人生最根本的体验。它就像我的基石。我几乎把自己看作是家庭的一份子。这就是为什么家庭体验对我来说如此重要。
[00:02:23.890] It kind of translates to the greatest long-term project in my life is like my family. Honestly, that makes sense. I can see what you mean. Yeah. So I guess my biggest dream is being a PM for my family. Oh my God. It's just your career dream moved over into family. Yeah. And I don't know, sometimes I feel self-conscious that this is like my biggest dream and my biggest
[00:02:23.890] 这其实就相当于我人生中最伟大的长期项目就是我的家庭。说真的，这很有道理。我明白你的意思。是啊。所以我想，我最大的梦想就是成为我家庭的守护者。我的天哪。这不就是把你的职业梦想转移到家庭上吗？是啊。而且我不知道，有时候我会觉得有点不好意思，因为这就像是我最大的梦想，也是我最大的……
[00:02:53.210] ambition because a lot of people have very career-oriented dreams and ambitions. I feel like if I had to define a career-related dream right now, I eventually want to be in a very managerial position. But I don't know. I used to say like, oh, I want to be in the C-suite in the next X number of years or at least like a VP. And I felt like I could see myself doing things like that and wanted to grow my skill set into that direction.
[00:02:53.210] 很多人都有很强的事业抱负，所以说我也有野心。如果现在要我定义一个与事业相关的梦想，我觉得我最终想担任管理职位。但我也不确定。我以前常说，我希望在未来几年内进入高管层，或者至少成为副总裁。我觉得自己可以胜任这些工作，也想朝着这个方向提升自己的技能。
[00:03:23.590] But now that I am where I am right now, I'm like, is it just better to have a chill job with like a chill work-life balance so that I could be there at pick up and drop off for all my kids? Not that you can't do both, but you know, my priorities are just like shifting. Like maybe I could sacrifice a little bit more here so that I could be there more often for my family. I don't know. Yeah, this is a very traditional way of thinking.
[00:03:23.590] 但现在我身处这样的境地，我在想，是不是找一份轻松的工作，工作生活平衡也好，这样我就可以接送孩子上下学了？当然，两者兼顾也不是不行，但你知道，我的重心好像在转移。也许我应该在工作上多做出一些牺牲，这样就能多陪陪家人。我也不知道。嗯，这确实是一种很传统的想法。
[00:03:49.450] You joked how you're like, this is bringing feminism back by like 20 years. I don't think it's that dramatic because realistically, yeah, I think if anyone were to start a family, those are thoughts that they would have. How do I be there for the family? Is there any area that I need to adjust? How do I like rebalance my life with this new upcoming, we'll call it a project? Perfect.
[00:03:49.450] 你开玩笑说，这感觉就像把女权主义带回了20年前。我觉得没那么夸张，因为说实话，我觉得任何人如果要组建家庭，都会有这些想法。我该如何兼顾家庭？我需要在哪些方面做出调整？我该如何重新平衡我的生活和这个即将到来的——我们姑且称之为“新项目”吧？完美。
[00:04:16.610] So I feel like those are very normal thoughts to have. But yeah, I think it's definitely like a big change, especially because you'll probably have to like take a bit of a break from work for a little, I guess like reassess your career in a sense. How much are you willing to put into that? Or like, do you really need to be C-suite or something like that? Yeah.
[00:04:16.610] 所以我觉得这些都是很正常的想法。不过，这确实是一个很大的改变，尤其因为你可能需要暂时放下工作，重新评估一下自己的职业生涯。你愿意为此投入多少？或者说，你真的需要成为高管之类的吗？嗯。
[00:04:41.250] Recently, I've been putting like my observation cap on at work and low-key observing and sometimes even like asking women around me, female co-workers who have kids, seeing how they balance their schedule, like seeing what they can slot into their day, asking them questions about like, do you feel like it's hard to do this? You know, what tips have you like gained over the last few years after you have your kid and things like that?
[00:04:41.250] 最近，我在工作中开始留意观察，不经意地观察，有时甚至会问身边有孩子的女同事，看看她们是如何平衡工作和生活的，看看她们一天能挤出些什么时间，问问她们一些问题，比如，你觉得这样做难吗？你知道，自从有了孩子，这几年你都总结了哪些经验等等。
[00:05:09.870] So I've been trying to gain and like amass as much knowledge as possible. Yeah. To prepare myself. And it's been cool. I mentioned earlier that I would rather have a chill work-life balance instead of gunning for like an executive role. But honestly, when you look at people around you, like so many people ride that balance very well. But many women are so more than capable of handling both workloads at the same time.
[00:05:09.870] 所以我一直在努力学习和积累尽可能多的知识。是的，为了做好准备。这感觉很棒。我之前说过，我更喜欢轻松的工作生活平衡，而不是一味追求高管职位。但说实话，当你观察周围的人，你会发现很多人都能很好地平衡工作和生活。而且很多女性完全有能力同时兼顾工作和生活。
[00:05:38.690] So hopefully I'll get there. I think that's like my long-term goal of being like a career woman, climbing up the corporate ladder, things like that, while also having a family and really being there for my kids. Sometimes I just think a lot of womanhood is about like sharing this knowledge, passing things down generation and generation. Ooh, yeah. Actually, that reminds me of this TikTok I once saw where someone was like, women have menopause.
[00:05:38.690] 所以，希望我能实现这个目标。我觉得我的长期目标是成为一名职业女性，在职场上步步高升，同时又能兼顾家庭，真正陪伴我的孩子。有时候我觉得，女性的意义就在于分享知识，将经验代代相传。哦，对。这让我想起之前在TikTok上看到的一个视频，有人说，女性也会经历更年期。
[00:06:08.430] One way you can think about the reason for that is that women at a certain point don't need to procreate anymore. And they can just spend the rest of their lives passing down knowledge. I guess the argument was like versus men, they always are able to procreate. So that's just their main duty, I guess.
[00:06:08.430] 你可以这样理解：女性到了某个阶段就不再需要生育了，她们可以把余生都用来传承知识。我想，这种观点的反面是，男性始终拥有生育能力，所以生育是他们最重要的职责。
[00:06:33.830] I've also seen people say like women have to learn tips and tricks in their life to like protect themselves from, you know, outside external dangers and whatnot. So then they want to pass that knowledge on to other people who may not know the ropes yet. And I remember even growing up, like I would always get all these tips from like my aunts and stuff. I'm so used to like asking other women for advice. So I feel like this is just the natural progression. How do I live life in my 30s?
[00:06:33.830] 我也看到有人说，女性在生活中需要学习一些技巧和窍门，比如如何保护自己免受外界危险等等。然后她们想把这些知识传授给其他可能还不了解这些的人。我记得小时候，我总是从我的阿姨们那里得到各种各样的建议。我已经习惯了向其他女性寻求建议。所以我觉得这只是很自然的发展过程。我该如何在30岁的时候生活呢？
[00:07:03.690] So true. So true. And also, on another note, I have seen lots of women be like directors and also have children. And I feel like that's a pretty good in-between. You like no need to be necessarily a president or like a C-suite, but they're in a pretty powerful and successful position. Dude, and I feel like one of the big pros of being a director, at least in big corporations,
[00:07:03.690] 确实如此。确实如此。另外，我还看到很多女性担任总监，同时也是孩子的母亲。我觉得这算是一个很不错的折中方案。她们不一定非得是总裁或者高管，但她们已经身居要职，而且非常成功。老兄，我觉得在大公司里，担任总监的一大优势是……
[00:07:31.690] is that you usually end up getting like an assistant. And then that like helps a lot. It is interesting though. Like, I mean, I'm not like really actively counting, but I feel like I have some sort of mental tally of when female co-workers will be like, oh, I have to go pick up my kids versus male co-workers. And I feel like it's more commonly the female ones that worry about like the daycare pickup and whatnot. So I don't know. I'm sure it's different family to family. Yeah.
[00:07:31.690] 就是你通常会得到一个助理之类的。那样的话就方便多了。不过这挺有意思的。我的意思是，我并没有刻意去数，但我感觉自己心里有个大概的统计，就是女同事什么时候会说“哦，我得去接孩子了”，而男同事又会不会这么说。我觉得通常是女性更担心接孩子之类的事情。所以我也说不准。当然，每个家庭的情况都不一样。嗯。
[00:08:00.250] But in a way, I wonder if it's something that the woman ends up taking on a little bit more often. It's time to turn James into a trophy husband. True. As long as the household makes it out okay, right? Yeah. But how about you, Crystal? What do you think is your current big dream or ambition? Dude, I honestly don't know. So if you listened to the podcast last year, you could probably tell that I was having a
[00:08:00.250] 但从某种程度上来说，我怀疑这或许是女性最终会更频繁地承担的事情。是时候把詹姆斯变成一个花瓶丈夫了。没错。只要家庭能维持下去就行，对吧？是啊。那么你呢，克丽丝塔尔？你觉得你现在最大的梦想或抱负是什么？老兄，说实话，我也不知道。所以如果你听过去年的播客，你可能已经听出来我当时……
[00:08:29.690] lot of existential crises. And I can't lie, this year is just the same. And I feel like a lot of these crises are my thoughts on like, oh my God, what am I trying to achieve in life right now? Are these goals or ambitions or dreams applicable to me? Are they what I want? If they are like, what is the next step? Or like, what do I need to do?
[00:08:29.690] 很多时候都会陷入存在主义危机。说实话，今年也一样。我觉得很多危机都源于这样的思考：天哪，我现在的人生目标到底是什么？这些目标、抱负或梦想适合我吗？它们是我想要的吗？如果是的话，下一步该怎么做？或者，我需要做些什么？
[00:08:59.490] I guess like one of the big questions is, and we did talk about this before too. Do I want to have kids? What does marriage even mean? Like all that kind of stuff. So I had to like, come to terms with what was maybe holding me back or causing fear in my thoughts about these things. I don't think I shared it because it was more of a recent revelation.
[00:08:59.490] 我想，其中一个很重要的问题是，我们之前也讨论过这个问题：我想要孩子吗？婚姻到底意味着什么？诸如此类的问题。所以我必须正视那些可能阻碍我或让我对这些事情感到恐惧的想法。我想我之前没跟别人说，是因为这是我最近才意识到的。
[00:09:23.530] I actually fear falling into really traditional roles in marriage. So kind of like what you were talking about too. I don't want to be the person who has to like give up their career just to like, you know, be in a family. And I don't want to be the one who ends up always doing the household chores because somehow my career has become way less important in the household.
[00:09:23.530] 我其实很害怕在婚姻中陷入非常传统的角色设定。就像你刚才说的，我也有点害怕。我不想成为那种为了组建家庭而不得不放弃事业的人。我也不想成为那种因为事业在家庭中变得不再重要，最终只能包揽家务的人。
[00:09:50.150] Or, you know, I'm like always serving my potential husband or whatever. It just feels very like wrong to me and it is not aligned with my values. So I think because I grew up seeing a lot of that, it instilled some sort of subconscious fear of marriage then. So now I'm like grappling with that. Honestly, that's a good point because I feel like a lot of how we see the world and how
[00:09:50.150] 或者，你知道，我总是感觉自己好像在伺候我未来的丈夫之类的。这让我觉得很不对劲，也不符合我的价值观。我想，因为我从小就经常看到这种情况，所以潜意识里对婚姻产生了一种恐惧。所以现在我正在努力克服这种恐惧。说实话，你说的很有道理，因为我觉得我们看待世界的方式，以及我们如何看待世界，都很大程度上取决于此。
[00:10:19.690] we see these things, structures like marriage and whatnot is so impacted by what we know, like in our childhood. I think you're either okay with it or you want to like change or like fight it in a way. Like I think I also grew up seeing similar things as you and I'm like kind of okay with it. Like obviously I would tweak it, but I think at the end of the day, I'm okay with like a structure like that in a sense.
[00:10:19.690] 我们看到，像婚姻之类的社会结构深受我们所知，比如童年经历的影响。我觉得你要么接受它，要么想要改变它，或者以某种方式反抗它。我觉得我小时候也和你一样，看到的是类似的情况，所以我基本上能接受。当然，我会做一些调整，但总的来说，我觉得这种社会结构在某种程度上是可以接受的。
[00:10:46.310] But I can also see how if that's not what you want, it would make me question is marriage then what I want? Like as a family then what I want? I think to an extent our age right now, this is where we really start fighting things like that. You know what I mean? So much of what I've wanted at a younger age was kind of like handed to me on a silver platter. Like, oh, you want to be this job or like you want to be this position. And I'm like, okay, yeah, you're right.
[00:10:46.310] 但我也能理解，如果那不是你想要的，那我就会质疑婚姻是不是我想要的？家庭是不是我想要的？我觉得在我们这个年纪，我们开始真正地去思考这些问题。你明白我的意思吗？我年轻时想要的很多东西，就像是唾手可得。比如，哦，你想做这份工作，或者你想担任这个职位。然后我就想，好吧，你说得对。
[00:11:15.230] And then now I'm like, do I? And I think it's like, it's crazy too, because part of me is like not even sure what my career ambitions are. So it's like, oh God, how can I have ambitions in like any part of my life? I don't think I have it figured out at all. Do you think in a way it's also like things feel easier when you're younger? So like having a dream or an ambition feels lighter.
[00:11:15.230] 现在我就想，我真的有吗？我觉得这很疯狂，因为我甚至不确定自己的职业目标是什么。所以我就想，天哪，我怎么可能在人生的任何方面有抱负呢？我觉得我完全没想明白。你觉得是不是年轻的时候事情会更容易一些？拥有梦想或抱负会感觉更轻松？
[00:11:42.730] And then now that we're older, maybe it feels more real. And we're just like, oh, do we want to label this as our dream? Oh my God. Absolutely. I had the same kind of dreams as you did. And as a kid, I was like, oh my God, can't wait to become an adult, have a job, have an office, just like what you're thinking. And then now it's like, okay, well, we're just in an open layout, open floor plan. You're like, there's no cubicles here. And like, there's no high rises that at least in the suburbs.
[00:11:42.730] 现在我们年纪大了，也许感觉更真实了。我们会想，哦，我们真的想把这称为我们的梦想吗？天哪。当然想。我以前也和你一样有过类似的梦想。小时候，我也会想，天哪，我迫不及待地想长大成人，找到一份工作，拥有自己的办公室，就像你现在想的那样。而现在，感觉就像，好吧，我们现在只是在一个开放式的办公空间里工作。你会想，这里没有隔间。而且，至少在郊区，也没有高楼大厦。
[00:12:15.400] But then like, that was like kind of all the dreams substance, you know, there wasn't anything else to it. Like, what am I doing in this office? You know, what is my role? And now it's like, okay, I actually know the structure of corporate ladder or whatever. And so yeah, like you said, it just feels way more real. And it's like, oh, well, if I'm going to make a goal or have an ambition, I have to have specifics for it now. And it's like, what does that mean?
[00:12:15.400] 但感觉就像，那些梦想都只剩下实质内容了，你知道，没有其他东西。比如，我在这间办公室里干什么？我的角色是什么？现在感觉就像，好吧，我终于了解了公司晋升的阶梯结构之类的。所以，就像你说的，感觉真实多了。然后就觉得，哦，如果我要设定目标或抱负，现在就必须具体化了。然后我就想，这到底意味着什么？
[00:12:44.200] Once you like put more into it? Yeah. I feel like this is why sometimes I find myself being envious of people who have very detailed things that they want for themselves in life, whether that's career or not. You know, I think you just have to like really want it to be able to even draw up something detailed about it. And I think the only thing that I've really wanted was again, like this dream of like having a family and being a mom and stuff like that.
[00:12:44.200] 一旦你更深入地思考，就会更投入了？是的。我觉得这就是为什么我有时会羡慕那些对自己的生活有着非常具体目标的人，不管是事业还是其他方面。你知道，我觉得你必须真的非常渴望，才能把它详细地规划出来。而我真正想要的，大概就是拥有一个家庭，成为一名母亲之类的梦想吧。
[00:13:12.240] So in that world, I have a lot of visions. I have a lot of things mapped out in terms of what I want. But yeah, in the career and like office and, you know, that kind of stuff, it's like very fleeting visions. So if you were to ask me, like, what's the title that you want to be 15 years from now? Like, I have no idea. I just be living my day to day in that sense. So that's why I feel like it's harder to have like a career specific dream or ambition.
[00:13:12.240] 所以在那个世界里，我有很多愿景。我规划了很多我想要的东西。但是，在职业生涯、办公室工作之类的领域，那些愿景往往转瞬即逝。所以，如果你问我，比如，15年后你想成为什么样的人？我完全不知道。我只能过好每一天。所以我觉得，要有一个具体的职业梦想或抱负，就更难了。
[00:13:41.780] And honestly, I feel like it's really good that you do know in one aspect of your life what you really want, because then you can, as you said, like you're able to have more ideas and like visions and like know what you want within this realm of like having a family. So then it's easier to like build the vision around that core value. Right. I'm envious of that a little bit.
[00:13:41.780] 说实话，我觉得你在人生的某个方面清楚自己真正想要什么真的很好，因为就像你说的，这样你就能有更多想法和愿景，也能更清楚地知道自己在组建家庭这个领域想要什么。这样一来，围绕这个核心价值观构建愿景就更容易了。没错，我有点羡慕你这一点。
[00:14:06.220] I only know like one very vague ambition or dream of mine, which is I want to eventually be my own boss, I guess. Hopefully I can manage to find a way to work for myself and not have to be confined to like, you know, all the corporate stuff and like that. But it's like such a vague dream. I have no solution for it. How do I get there?
[00:14:06.220] 我只有一个非常模糊的抱负或梦想，那就是最终想成为自己的老板。我希望能够找到一种自主创业的方式，摆脱公司里那些繁琐的事务。但这真的只是一个很模糊的梦想，我不知道该如何实现。我该如何才能实现它呢？
[00:14:35.320] You know, like what is the role entail? All that kind of stuff. That's a good dream, actually. And it's so funny because I've actually never wanted that for myself because growing up, my dad used to run his own business for a little bit. So I'm just like, damn, that's like a lot of work. But knowing you, knowing how quickly you achieve your own dreams, I'm like, I could totally see that happening for you. Wow. Thanks. Thanks.
[00:14:35.320] 你知道，比如这个职位具体包含哪些内容？诸如此类。这其实是个不错的梦想。说来也怪，我从来没想过自己会做那样的事，因为我小时候，我爸曾经自己经营过一段时间的生意。所以我就觉得，天哪，那得有多辛苦啊。但是了解你，知道你实现梦想的速度有多快，我就觉得，这完全有可能发生在你身上。哇。谢谢。谢谢。
[00:15:04.220] I feel like I don't even need people working under me as long as it's like just me and sustainable. That's pretty good already. I would claim that as reaching the goal. Well, you know, what's so funny, too, is like the more we talk about this stuff, I'm so curious if we were to do this recording like four years ago. Oh, my God. What would we have said? I feel like you might have said living by yourself. Dude, yes. I have no idea what I would have said.
[00:15:04.220] 我觉得只要只有我一个人，而且能维持下去，我就不需要人手了。这样就已经很好了。我觉得这就算达到目标了。你知道吗，还有一件很有趣的事，就是我们聊得越多，我就越好奇，如果我们四年前录这段录音会怎么样。我的天哪。我们会说什么呢？我觉得你可能会说“独自生活”。兄弟，没错。我完全不知道我会说什么。
[00:15:34.360] Maybe you would still say family. Yeah, probably. Or something related to that. Yeah, I feel like that's a very core value for you. I guess the question that comes to mind is does what we qualify as a dream and ambition change as we age? Or is it more just like we're checking things off? Like you already completed the living by yourself thing. So it's no longer a dream or ambition. It's just your reality. True. True. Oh, wait, I do have a dream.
[00:15:34.360] 或许你还是会说家庭。嗯，大概吧。或者跟家庭有关的东西。嗯，我觉得家庭对你来说是个非常重要的核心价值观。我想问的是，随着年龄增长，我们对梦想和抱负的定义会改变吗？还是说，我们只是在逐一完成某些事情？比如你已经完成了独自生活这件事。所以它不再是梦想或抱负，而是你的现实。没错。没错。哦，等等，我确实有个梦想。
[00:16:03.940] News alert. Crystal has a dream. Oh, my God. Thank God you brought this up because it's actually a it's a very big dream of mine. And it's kind of related to living alone, but it's like the next level. So the dream is to be a homeowner. I want to be the sole homeowner of a property. Hell yeah. Because then I'll be able to do whatever I want to it, you know, put as many holes in the walls I want, like paint the walls, whatever color I want. Yeah. Like all of that kind of stuff.
[00:16:03.940] 新闻快讯！克丽丝塔尔有个梦想。哦，我的天哪！感谢上帝你提起这件事，因为这其实是我一个非常大的梦想。它和独居有点关系，但又更进一步。我的梦想是成为一名房主。我想成为一处房产的唯一所有者。太棒了！因为那样我就可以随心所欲地改造它，比如在墙上打多少洞都行，想刷什么颜色的油漆都行。对，就是诸如此类的事情。
[00:16:33.060] And I know this is like a dream that you're actively working towards, too. So it's maybe like your current big dream. Mm hmm. You know, OK, actually, I have thought about this before and I think I just haven't thought about dreams and ambitions in a while. So it wasn't top of mind when we started this episode. But I do kind of have or had a view about the state of my personal dreams and ambitions
[00:16:33.060] 我知道这就像你正在积极努力实现的一个梦想。所以，这或许是你目前最大的梦想。嗯。好吧，其实我以前也想过这个问题，只是我已经很久没认真思考过梦想和抱负了。所以，在我们开始录制这期节目的时候，这并不是我最先想到的话题。但我确实对我的个人梦想和抱负有一些看法。
[00:17:02.240] in the grand scheme of life, which is probably four years ago. I was also thinking like, yeah, marriage and like kids and that kind of stuff is all part of our natural life progression. Lately, I've been questioning it more. But back then, my thought was always, well, if that's going to come, you know, like sharing my life with someone and potentially having a kid and therefore your life really becomes about the kid.
[00:17:02.240] 从人生的大局来看，大概是四年前吧。当时我也在想，结婚生子之类的都是我们人生自然发展的一部分。最近，我开始更多地思考这个问题。但那时候，我总是想，如果这一切真的会发生，比如和某人共度一生，可能还会生孩子，那么你的生活就真的会围绕着孩子转了。
[00:17:32.240] My thought was like, then I have to achieve as many slash all of my dreams and ambitions before getting into that. Oh, my God. You're like blowing my mind a little bit. That's wild. Wow. Wow. Because then like once those things come along, it's not about you anymore. Hmm. That's a good point. You can still work towards things, of course, and still fight for your dreams and ambitions,
[00:17:32.240] 我当时想，那我必须在投入到那件事之前尽可能多地实现我的梦想和抱负。我的天哪。你这番话真是让我大开眼界。太不可思议了。哇。哇。因为一旦那些事情发生了，就不再以你为中心了。嗯。你说得对。当然，你仍然可以继续努力，仍然可以为你的梦想和抱负而奋斗。
[00:18:00.580] but you'll just have other things in the household to also keep afloat. So when it comes down to prioritizing, your thing may not be the first on the list. Yeah, exactly. I think it started to feel like a time pressure. And so in more recent years, I've been like trying to release that pressure, not think about the time restraint as much.
[00:18:00.580] 但家里还有其他事情要处理。所以到了要分清轻重缓急的时候，你的事情可能就不是首要的了。没错，就是这样。我觉得那时候开始有点时间压力。所以最近几年，我一直在努力释放这种压力，尽量不去想时间限制的问题。
[00:18:25.700] So maybe that's why my dreams and ambitions have scattered a little or softened a little. I don't know. Damn. Do you think guys think about this time pressure thing? No. This is just the female experience. Yeah. I mean, to an extent too, I think this also just applies to slowly as we age, we just become more realistic and practical and think about the logistics behind everything.
[00:18:25.700] 所以也许这就是为什么我的梦想和抱负变得有些分散或软化了。我不知道。唉。你觉得男生会考虑时间压力吗？不会。这只是女性的体验。是啊。我的意思是，在某种程度上，我觉得随着年龄的增长，我们也会变得更加现实和务实，开始考虑所有事情背后的实际问题。
[00:18:54.120] So I think it's also just how our dreams evolve and how we like choose to shape them as well. But what is that age cutoff is the question, right? Like when do dreams more from visions of me in a high rise glass office into like, what do I have to do in the next eight years to achieve this five step plan type of thing? Okay. So I have a younger cousin.
[00:18:54.120] 所以我觉得，这还取决于我们的梦想如何演变，以及我们如何选择塑造它们。但问题是，这个年龄界限在哪里？比如，梦想什么时候会从“我在高楼大厦的玻璃办公室里”变成“我需要在未来八年内做些什么来实现这个五步计划”之类的？好吧，我有个比我小的表弟。
[00:19:21.840] I think they were either 22 or 23. So they're like pretty young, pretty like fresh out of school and all of that. And my brother and I, we noticed that our little cousin is very ambitious right now. He's like, yeah, I'm all about the grind. You know, I'm really into my work right now and I want to achieve these things. And my brother and I, to be fair, my brother and I are pretty similar that we're more like
[00:19:21.840] 我觉得他们当时应该22、23岁。所以他们很年轻，感觉刚毕业不久。我和我哥注意到，我们的小表弟现在很有上进心。他说，是啊，我一心扑在努力上。你知道，我现在真的很投入工作，想要实现这些目标。说实话，我和我哥其实挺像的，我们更像是……
[00:19:50.160] laid back for most things. And so we were kind of like, dude, we're just like, yeah, I guess, you know, keep at it. But like in our minds, we're kind of like, dude, my brother was like ready to quit at that time. He's like, I want to take a sabbatical. And I'm like, yeah, I'm just thankful I have so much flexibility at work right now. And so I think at one point I said something like, that's how you feel now. But just wait a couple of years.
[00:19:50.160] 我们对大多数事情都比较随和。所以我们当时就想，哥们儿，我们当时就想，行了，继续努力吧。但其实我们心里都想，哥们儿，我哥当时都想辞职了。他说，我想休个长假。我就想，是啊，我很庆幸我现在的工作时间很灵活。所以我觉得我当时说过类似这样的话：你现在这么想，但再过几年你就知道了。
[00:20:20.280] You're going to get jaded like us. And then my brother was like, oh, Crystal, don't say that. Just let him have his moment. You know, let him like go all in and like whatever. And I was like, damn, my brother's right. I should just like zip my mouth and, you know, let this dude go through everything. And maybe because he has such powerful ambitions now, it could carry over. But I feel like there's definitely a point in the late 20s where you become a little more
[00:20:20.280] 你会像我们一样变得愤世嫉俗。然后我哥说，哦，克丽丝塔尔，别这么说。就让他好好享受这一刻吧。你知道，就让他全力以赴，随他便。我当时就想，该死，我哥说得对。我应该闭嘴，让他把一切都经历一遍。也许是因为他现在雄心勃勃，这种劲头可能会延续下去。但我感觉，到了二十七八岁，人肯定会变得有点……
[00:20:48.500] jaded for some of these things. And you're like, OK, some of these ambitions were a little ambitious. Let's like take a step back, look at reality. What is achievable and reasonable so we don't have to like stress ourselves out so much to try to reach some really intense goal? Oh, that's a good point. And I feel like at many points of my life, I was your cousin. Like I never stopped.
[00:20:48.500] 我对其中一些事情感到厌倦。你会想，好吧，有些目标确实有点太远大了。我们不妨退后一步，看看现实。哪些目标是可实现的、合理的，这样我们就不用为了追求某个远大的目标而给自己施加那么大的压力了？哦，你说得对。我觉得我人生中的很多阶段，我就像你的表哥一样。我好像从未停止过。
[00:21:17.840] Climb the corporate ladder like that. For sure. I wonder if it's like you just have to reach some level of failure. And I don't mean failure in a completely negative sense of like I crashed and burned, but more of just like you hit that point where you're like, actually, what I wanted for myself was bigger than what I could provide for myself or like what I could reach right now. Or if it's just observing other people around you, you know, I can't have been the only person
[00:21:17.840] 那样往上爬，肯定没问题。我在想，是不是必须经历某种程度的失败才能成功。我说的失败不是指彻底失败，而是那种彻底失败、一败涂地的失败，而是那种意识到自己想要的东西其实比现在能提供的或能达到的要多得多。或者，如果你观察一下周围的人，就会发现，肯定不止我一个人有这种感觉。
[00:21:47.540] who went into my career thinking that I could do this in X number of years. Yeah. And other capable people around me have not been able to reach that. So maybe it's not as realistic. I don't know what it is, but I feel like I, it must have been around like age 26 ish that I started to feel really jaded. Now I've crossed the bridge and become this like shake my cane at, you know, kids on the lawn type of person.
[00:21:47.540] 我当初进入这个行业的时候，以为自己能在几年内达到目标。是啊。而我身边其他有能力的人都没能做到。所以也许这并不现实。我不知道具体原因，但感觉大概在26岁左右，我开始变得非常愤世嫉俗。现在我已经过了那个阶段，变成了那种拿着拐杖在草坪上晃悠小孩的那种人。
[00:22:14.980] But in a way, I wonder if we all carried that energy of your cousin, like into our 30s and 40s, like if we could just achieve more, like, is it a self-fulfilling prophecy of like, oh, I feel like I can't achieve this. I'm going to lower my dreams or I'm going to lower my expectations. And then we just hit lower dreams and ambitions. Honestly, maybe. I think you're right. Like if we were still really excited and like super ambitious about certain things,
[00:22:14.980] 但从某种程度上来说，我很好奇我们是不是都把你表哥的那种能量带到了三四十岁，好像我们还能取得更大的成就似的。这会不会是一种自我实现的预言，比如，觉得自己做不到，就降低梦想或者降低期望值？然后我们就真的只能接受更低的梦想和抱负。说实话，也许是这样。我觉得你说得对。如果我们仍然对某些事情充满热情和雄心壮志，
[00:22:42.980] we would probably dig up the energy somehow. Right. Right. I think also on my end, I maybe stopped looking at bigger long-term goals that were like vague and undefined, started to look more at like, okay, what is the next step? And like how reasonable or how should I approach this goal if I can't achieve it?
[00:22:42.980] 我们大概会想办法把能源挖出来。对。对。我觉得就我而言，我可能不再关注那些模糊不清的长远目标，而是开始更多地思考，下一步是什么？如果我无法实现这个目标，我应该如何合理地或以何种方式去实现它？
[00:23:10.340] Because sometimes, especially in the corporate ladder, sometimes you actually just can't achieve something because of certain blockers. Whether it's like, you know, a team that doesn't support you properly or this role wasn't actually that fitted for you, you know, that kind of stuff. So it's like how reasonable is this next goal? And if it's not reasonable or not possible, then like how do I pivot? And that's like kind of how I think of things now.
[00:23:10.340] 因为有时候，尤其是在职场晋升中，你确实会因为某些障碍而无法达成目标。比如，团队没有给予你足够的支持，或者这个职位其实并不适合你，诸如此类。所以，这就好比在思考下一个目标是否合理？如果不合理或不可能，那我该如何调整方向？这就是我现在思考问题的方式。
[00:23:38.300] But I guess it's like the biggest thing is like putting less time restraint on it. Yeah. And I think the other thing too is sometimes like finding out you don't even want what you were working for or what you thought was such a big dream. I think there was a point where I wanted to climb the ladder and shoot up to like a higher position. After years of working towards that, I was like, is that even what I want for myself?
[00:23:38.300] 但我觉得最重要的是不要给自己设定太长的时间限制。是的。还有一点就是，有时候你会发现自己根本不想要之前努力追求的东西，或者曾经以为的远大梦想。我曾经很想往上爬，一步步晋升到更高的职位。但经过多年的努力之后，我开始怀疑，这真的是我想要的吗？
[00:24:05.280] Like, is this end goal just me chasing a title? Or do I actually want the lifestyle that comes with this role? You know, it's not to say that I had that realization and then I turned down the job offer that was that role. Like, obviously, I was also like not getting there. Right. But I think it's natural for dreams and ambitions to morph and shape into different things. So a lot, I think, just happens like in these progressions. That's true.
[00:24:05.280] 比如，我最终的目标仅仅是追求一个头衔吗？还是我真的想要这份工作带来的生活方式？你知道，这并不是说我意识到这一点后就拒绝了那份工作邀请。显然，我也意识到自己并没有达到那个目标。没错。但我认为梦想和抱负自然会不断演变，最终变成其他的东西。所以很多事情，我觉得，都是在这样的过程中自然而然发生的。确实如此。
[00:24:34.740] Like sometimes I'll see someone in a certain position and I'm like, wait, that person's like hella busy. Yeah. Like that's a lot of post 6 p.m. Slack messages. And then it's like, do I actually want that? Or? Right. You're so right. Because I think there was a moment, multiple moments actually, where I was like, is it worth it to become more than an IC?
[00:24:34.740] 有时候我会看到某个人身居要职，然后我就想，等等，这个人也太忙了吧。是啊，比如晚上六点以后Slack消息特别多。然后我就想，我真的想要那样吗？还是……？对，你说得太对了。因为我觉得有那么几个时刻，我都在想，成为比IC（独立贡献者）更重要的人，真的值得吗？
[00:25:03.640] Like individual contributor? Am I capable of taking care of other people? And like, is that something, that level of work and care, something that I want for myself even? Honestly, still thinking about that. Yeah. But the image is clearer and you have more to consider. So true. I don't know. Maybe also part of it, maybe we're just like whittling down the dreams into, like you said, like achievable, like bite-sized steps.
[00:25:03.640] 像个独立贡献者？我能照顾好其他人吗？而且，这种工作量和责任心，是我自己想要的吗？说实话，我还在考虑这个问题。是啊。但现在思路更清晰了，需要考虑的事情也更多了。确实如此。我不知道。也许部分原因在于，我们就像你说的，正在把梦想一点点地分解成可实现的小目标。
[00:25:32.580] But also just, why do I even want this? You know? Yeah. I think something that you mentioned was like at the core of this like vision that I have for myself. What's like the real value in it all? Dude, Ashley, that is like a good point that you brought up because we were kind of discussing this when we were planning this episode that some dreams have a basic core, but they can manifest in a lot of different ways.
[00:25:32.580] 但同时，我又在想，我到底为什么想要这个？你知道吗？嗯。我觉得你刚才提到的，正是我对自己愿景的核心所在。这一切的真正价值是什么？艾什莉，你说的很有道理，因为我们在筹备这期节目的时候也讨论过这个问题：有些梦想有一个基本的核心，但它们可以以很多不同的方式呈现出来。
[00:26:01.400] So then maybe the idea is you figure out what that core dream is and like how to pivot so that you can still get it. So one of the interesting examples that we had thought of was that there's this potential core basic dream of wanting recognition, but then that can manifest in a lot of different ways because I have this secret dream that I want. I want some level of like fame, I guess.
[00:26:01.400] 所以，或许关键在于弄清楚你的核心梦想是什么，以及如何调整方向才能最终实现它。我们想到的一个有趣的例子是，有些人可能的核心梦想是渴望获得认可，但这可以有很多不同的表现形式，因为我也有个秘密的梦想。我想，我想要某种程度的名气。
[00:26:30.640] But for you, maybe you also want recognition, but it just doesn't manifest in the like, I want fame necessarily. Right. I'm like, I want to be PTA president. You're like, I'm trying to be C-suite. CEO of my family. Yeah. But yeah, honestly, when we were talking about those before, as we planned, that kind of blew my mind a little bit because it's very true.
[00:26:30.640] 但对你来说，或许你也渴望获得认可，只是这种渴望不会以“我一定要出名”的形式表现出来。对吧？我可能想当家长教师联谊会主席，而你却想成为家族企业的首席执行官。是啊。不过说实话，之前我们讨论这些的时候，就像我们计划的那样，你的话确实让我有点震惊，因为这非常真实。
[00:26:57.360] And I'm sure listeners who listened to our past episodes know that sometimes I can be like a big hater. And one of the things that I semi enjoy hating on is LinkedIn warriors who post a lot about their achievements and accolades and their dreams on LinkedIn. It's all in jest. Like, I don't obviously really, truly hate these people, but sometimes I find myself being
[00:26:57.360] 我相信听过我们之前节目的听众都知道，有时候我有点像个爱吐槽的人。我半开玩笑地吐槽的其中一件事就是那些在领英上大肆炫耀自己成就、荣誉和梦想的“领英战士”。当然，这只是玩笑。我当然不是真的讨厌这些人，但有时候我发现自己会……
[00:27:26.840] like, damn, these people are really on this grind for something that why do they even want this? But then at the core of it, don't we all just want like the same five core values? You know what I mean? Yeah. Like maybe what I want for myself looks different from what they want, but what we're chasing is still the same thing, like at the root of it all. So true. And it's like, oh, well, I think I can get this whatever this way.
[00:27:26.840] 真是的，这些人为了某些东西拼命奋斗，他们到底为什么想要这些？但归根结底，我们追求的不都是那五个核心价值观吗？你明白我的意思吗？是啊。也许我想要的和他们想要的不一样，但我们追求的本质上是一样的。确实如此。然后就会想，哦，好吧，我想我可以用这种方法得到我想要的。
[00:27:56.920] And someone else was like, well, I think I can get it through this avenue. Right. I think it's just very interesting. And it's an interesting time where we start to fork away from peers that we grew up with or other people in our age, because when we're 17 years old, we're all just trying to get into whatever college. Right. Yeah. And then post-college, everyone's paths and journeys look so vastly different.
[00:27:56.920] 另一个人则说，嗯，我觉得我可以通过这条路实现目标。没错。我觉得这很有意思。这是一个很有意思的时期，我们开始与从小一起长大的同龄人或其他同龄人渐行渐远，因为当我们17岁的时候，我们都只是想考上哪所大学。没错。是的。然后大学毕业后，每个人的道路和经历都截然不同。
[00:28:23.740] And I feel like at this age now, like I really feel how different everyone's career paths are. So it's always really cool. One of the really cool experiences is catching up with a classmate you haven't seen in a really long time or, you know, stumbling upon people's announcements on like Instagram or whatever and just being like, damn. We were all just once in those little seats in school.
[00:28:23.740] 我觉得到了这个年纪，我真的能感受到每个人的职业道路有多么不同。所以这总是很酷的。其中一件很酷的事情就是和很久没见的老同学叙旧，或者在Instagram之类的社交媒体上偶然看到别人的动态，然后就会想，天哪，我们都曾经坐在学校的小座位上。
[00:28:47.360] Our dreams might have seemed so much more similar because we only had that vague idea of the future. Right. But now it's like starting to sharpen. Yeah. Like the image is clear. Sometimes I'm very like fascinated or I guess, I don't know, just captured by the individuality of it all. I just cannot believe that we're all different people. Dude. Yeah. It's like we're actually coming into our own selves.
[00:28:47.360] 我们之前的梦想可能看起来那么相似，是因为我们对未来只有模糊的概念。没错。但现在感觉越来越清晰了。是啊，就像画面变得清晰起来。有时候我会非常着迷，或者说，我不知道，就是被每个人的独特性所吸引。我简直不敢相信我们都是不同的人。老兄。是啊，感觉我们真的开始认识自己了。
[00:29:17.340] Yeah. This totally makes me think about all those coming of age movies and books and stuff where there's like some point in the story where someone's like, oh, you're like different. You're this is not what we wanted for each other. You know, like we were best buddies and we had a plan together and all that. But it's like, yeah, like you did want the same thing probably, but it's manifesting in different ways of achievableness.
[00:29:17.340] 是啊。这让我想起所有那些成长题材的电影和书籍，故事里总会有那么一刻，有人会说：“哦，你跟以前不一样了。你跟我们当初希望的不一样。”你知道，我们曾经是最好的朋友，一起制定过计划什么的。但其实，你们想要的可能是一样的，只是实现的方式不同而已。
[00:29:46.220] Now you're starting to separate a bit. Yeah. And that's a lot for little kids coming of age. Yeah. And I think it's always actually very healthy to have a good mix of people around you, like in your social circle. Like people who want similar things and people who want completely different things. And just living in that balance is always so enriching and rewarding.
[00:29:46.220] 现在你们开始有点疏远了。是啊。这对即将成年的孩子来说压力很大。是啊。我觉得身边有各种各样的人，比如你的社交圈里，总是很有益的。既有志同道合的人，也有志趣相投的人。保持这种平衡的生活总是让人感到充实和满足。
[00:30:10.260] In a sense, I think even building out these social circles is also just what I want to pass down to my kid as well. Like it's also in my mind, like working towards my personal goal of creating like an enriching life for my kid so that they could see all these cool adults around them. Yeah. Like making sure they're able to see a variety. Yeah. Being able to almost pick and choose maybe.
[00:30:10.260] 从某种意义上说，我觉得构建这些社交圈也是我想传承给孩子的。我心里也一直想着，要努力为孩子创造一个丰富多彩的生活，让他们身边能接触到这么多优秀的成年人。是的，我想确保他们能接触到各种各样的人。嗯，让他们能够自己选择。
[00:30:37.340] Like, oh my God, I love that this auntie, you know, is doing this in her job or like that uncle is like doing that. Look at all these different career paths you can embark on. You're like, I curated this for you. My unborn, unconceived child. Okay. Well, I have a final question for us.
[00:30:37.340] 天哪，我太喜欢这位阿姨的工作了，或者那位叔叔的工作。看看这些不同的职业道路，你可以选择走。你会想，这些都是我为你精心挑选的。我未出生、未孕育的孩子。好的。那么，我还有一个问题。
[00:31:03.130] I know we talked a lot about how our dreams and ambitions have evolved a lot as we age. What do you think is the energy that really like helps to propel keeping that alive in our late 20s? How do we keep the DNA alive? To shorten it.
[00:31:03.130] 我知道我们之前聊过很多关于随着年龄增长，我们的梦想和抱负会发生多大变化。你觉得是什么能量让我们在接近30岁时依然保持这份热情？我们如何才能让这份热情永不消退？（为了缩短它。）
[00:31:24.410] And I guess the flip side to that too is what do you think you're willing to sacrifice or like give up to prioritize and achieve your biggest DNA? Dude, this is tough. I guess like keeping the dreams and ambition, the DNA alive. I think there is a maybe like necessity to it.
[00:31:24.410] 我想反过来想，为了实现你最大的梦想和抱负，你愿意牺牲什么，或者放弃什么？兄弟，这可真难。我想，保持梦想和抱负，保持你的DNA活力，这或许是必要的。
[00:31:49.050] It doesn't have to be like the biggest dream ever or like super ambitious goal. But I think it's always good to have something to work towards. Even if you aren't super sure about everything else, at least having like one thing that you know you can work towards is helpful and like maybe feeling purposeful for a bit.
[00:31:49.050] 它不必是惊天动地的梦想，也不一定要是雄心勃勃的目标。但我认为，有个努力的方向总是好的。即使你对其他事情不太确定，至少有一个可以努力的方向也会有所帮助，也能让你在一段时间内感到目标明确。
[00:32:14.130] And then also I think it just helps you force you to do stuff so that as you do stuff, maybe more things become clearer. Like as we've said throughout the episode, we've noticed for ourselves that as we go through life, certain things become more clear and we start to like understand ourselves a bit better. I think that's important because if you run out of something to keep you going, then that's probably when you're hitting like burnout or depression, right? Right.
[00:32:14.130] 而且我觉得它还能强迫你去做事，这样一来，随着你做事的深入，也许会有更多事情变得清晰起来。就像我们在这一集里一直提到的，我们自己也注意到，随着人生阅历的增长，某些事情会变得越来越清楚，我们也会开始更好地了解自己。我觉得这很重要，因为如果你失去了继续前进的动力，那很可能就是你精疲力竭或抑郁的时候，对吧？没错。
[00:32:44.010] Things start to unravel and then it's like a lot of difficult times and like hard times to pull yourself back together. I don't know. It is like hard to say because also everyone handles depression and like burnout differently. But I do think it's helpful to have your mind focused on something achievable. Yeah, I think I totally agree with that.
[00:32:44.010] 事情开始失控，然后就会经历很多艰难的时刻，很难重新振作起来。我不知道。很难说，因为每个人应对抑郁和倦怠的方式都不同。但我确实认为，把注意力集中在一些可实现的事情上会很有帮助。是的，我完全同意。
[00:33:09.450] And something I've been thinking about lately is like, you know how people when they have traumatic relationships, they like have a lot of things that weigh on their mind from that relationship, maybe a lot of fears and jadedness and like trauma and stuff like that. I feel like the same thing can happen in your career.
[00:33:09.450] 我最近一直在思考的一件事是，你知道，当人们经历过痛苦的感情关系后，他们会有很多来自那段关系的负面情绪萦绕在心头，比如恐惧、厌倦、创伤等等。我觉得同样的情况也会发生在你的职业生涯中。
[00:33:31.050] If you had a job that was very toxic, that baggage can really weigh on you and you can sometimes even carry that into your next job. I feel like that's also something that maybe should be talked about more or I don't know, just like we need to also process that like the same way that someone would be encouraged to process like a traumatic romantic relationship.
[00:33:31.050] 如果你曾经有过一份非常糟糕的工作，这种负面情绪会给你带来沉重的负担，有时甚至会延续到下一份工作中。我觉得这或许也应该被更多地讨论，或者说，就像我们需要像处理一段痛苦的恋爱关系那样去处理这种负面情绪一样。
[00:33:53.190] Yeah, I think not letting your jadedness and trauma from a different job or from like a specific period in your career, maybe carry on with you into other jobs, I think is very important. Part of that too is not getting swept up in the day to day all the time, taking purposeful breaks away from the day to day, because sometimes your Monday through Friday feels so busy and crazy. You don't always have time to step back and look at the big picture.
[00:33:53.190] 是的，我认为不要让之前工作或职业生涯某个特定时期带来的厌倦感和创伤延续到其他工作中，这一点非常重要。这其中也包括不要总是被日常琐事缠身，要刻意安排时间休息，因为有时候周一到周五会感觉非常忙碌和混乱。你根本没有时间停下来，从全局的角度看待问题。
[00:34:21.890] So I feel like part of keeping the dreams and ambitions alive is like allowing yourself to dream and not just doing the nine to five grind. Yeah, because I'm also thinking like your dreams and ambitions can totally be outside of work. Right. I'm just thinking of like, you know, tiny like goals that I might have in the day to day life.
[00:34:21.890] 所以我觉得，保持梦想和抱负的一部分，就是允许自己做梦，而不是仅仅朝九晚五地埋头苦干。是啊，因为我也觉得你的梦想和抱负完全可以存在于工作之外。没错。我只是在想，你知道，一些我日常生活中可能会有的很小的目标。
[00:34:43.270] Oh, I want to finish this book or like I want to watch this TV show or like I mean, these are like very silly goals, but like they're still kind of goals, right? Like micro dreams. Like I hope I can play this game with friends or like improve in this game, reach a certain level. And so it doesn't have to be so like intense. Every like dream and ambition has to be like a life altering thing. Yeah.
[00:34:43.270] 哦，我想看完这本书，或者我想看这部电视剧，或者，我的意思是，这些目标听起来很傻，但它们仍然是目标，对吧？就像微小的梦想。比如，我希望我能和朋友一起玩这个游戏，或者在这个游戏中有所进步，达到某个水平。所以，目标不必那么宏大。每一个梦想和抱负都必须是改变人生的。是的。
[00:35:12.430] And then I feel like that can hopefully bring little pieces of happiness. And then if you are finding comfort in these things, then maybe it helps you find that energy to like get away from the more toxic parts of your life if that's what you're going through. Yeah. Maybe it's like not putting so much weight on the idea of a dream and ambition. Like you don't have to have the dream. Yeah. Like you could have lots of dreams. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
[00:35:12.430] 然后我觉得这或许能带来一些小小的快乐。如果你能从这些事情中找到慰藉，那么也许它能帮助你找到能量，让你摆脱生活中那些更糟糕的部分（如果你正在经历这些的话）。是的。也许这就像是不要把梦想和抱负看得太重。你不必非得有梦想。是的。你可以有很多梦想。是的。没错。没错。
[00:35:39.510] And I guess like in terms of giving up something to achieve a dream or ambition, I think that's totally reasonable. Like you said, you want to have a family. And sometimes that might mean a dream or an ambition has to be scaled back, possibly even like given up. You can't have everything. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like very reasonable, I think. And sometimes that is maybe the hardest part. It's like, oh, shoot, I'm at a crossroads.
[00:35:39.510] 我觉得，为了实现梦想或抱负而放弃一些东西，完全合情合理。就像你说的，你想组建家庭。有时候，这意味着你必须缩减梦想或抱负的规模，甚至可能要放弃。你不可能拥有一切。是啊，是啊。所以我觉得这很合理。有时候，这或许是最难的部分。就像，哎呀，我站在人生的十字路口了。
[00:36:08.570] Like either I achieved this or I achieved that. Which one am I willing to like deprioritize? I feel like at our current stage of life, I don't feel like I've personally had to give up a lot yet. But I wonder if that's a new chapter we unlock in our like 30s or something of really learning to prioritize, learning to weigh out how much you want something. So I'm just waiting for it. You know, I'm like anticipating it a little bit.
[00:36:08.570] 就像我要么实现了这个目标，要么实现了那个目标。我愿意把哪一个优先级降低呢？我觉得在我们目前的人生阶段，我个人还没有真正需要放弃很多东西。但我不知道这是否会在我们30岁左右开启人生新篇章，真正学习如何分清轻重缓急，如何权衡自己对某件事的渴望程度。所以我正在等待那一刻的到来。你知道，我有点期待那一天的到来。
[00:36:37.910] Yeah, I think I'm similar to you. Like I haven't had any crazy crossroads like that either yet, but I'm sure there's going to be a lot that come up the like more complicated or more mature our lives get. Right. Well, thank you so much, Jisoo, for chatting about such a complicated yet vulnerable topic. There's kind of a lot to these like dreams and ambitions. And thank you for sharing so much.
[00:36:37.910] 是啊，我觉得我和你很像。我也还没经历过像你说的那种人生十字路口，但我相信随着生活变得越来越复杂、越来越成熟，肯定会遇到很多这样的事情。没错。Jisoo，非常感谢你和我聊这么复杂又脆弱的话题。这里面包含了很多关于梦想和抱负的东西。谢谢你分享这么多。
