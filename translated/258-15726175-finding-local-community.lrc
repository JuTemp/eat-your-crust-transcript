[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Michelle.
[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]：大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Michelle。
[00:00:16.670] [SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Michelle, a familiar voice of the podcast. The last episode Michelle was on was
[00:00:16.670] [SPEAKER_02]：欢迎回来，米歇尔，播客节目中大家熟悉的声音。米歇尔上次参与的节目是……
[00:00:23.610] [SPEAKER_02]: episode 201, Relationship Labels, where we talked about domestic partnerships, marriage,
[00:00:23.610] [SPEAKER_02]：第 201 集，关系标签，我们讨论了同居伴侣关系、婚姻，
[00:00:30.570] [SPEAKER_02]: all of those labels, very fun episode. But today we brought Michelle on to talk about building
[00:00:30.570] [SPEAKER_02]：所有这些标签，这期节目很有趣。但今天我们请来了米歇尔来谈谈构建。
[00:00:37.190] [SPEAKER_02]: community slash finding community. I think the Bay Area is very suburb heavy. So sometimes it can
[00:00:37.190] [SPEAKER_02]：社区/寻找社区。我认为湾区郊区化程度很高。所以有时候可能会
[00:00:45.350] [SPEAKER_02]: be difficult to find community in more sparse areas like this. And Michelle has been doing
[00:00:45.350] [SPEAKER_02]：在像这样人口稀少的地区很难找到社区。而米歇尔一直在这样做。
[00:00:51.610] [SPEAKER_02]: some pretty cool like community building events. So we thought it'd be really fun to
[00:00:51.610] [SPEAKER_02]：一些很棒的社区建设活动。所以我们觉得这会很有趣……
[00:00:56.190] [SPEAKER_00]: more about that. Yeah, so I guess to kind of kickstart the episode today, let's talk about
[00:00:56.190] [SPEAKER_00]：关于这一点，还有很多要说的。是的，所以我想为了开启今天的节目，我们先来聊聊……
[00:01:02.210] [SPEAKER_00]: community that we feel in this current day. Do you feel like right now your life is full of
[00:01:02.210] [SPEAKER_00]：我们如今感受到的社群。你觉得你现在的生活充满了……
[00:01:07.830] [SPEAKER_01]: community vibes? I love the term community vibes. Yeah, I love it. Like, it's a good way
[00:01:07.830] [SPEAKER_01]：社区氛围？我喜欢“社区氛围”这个词。对，我喜欢。这真是个好说法。
[00:01:14.370] [SPEAKER_01]: to frame it. Like, I'm feeling community vibes in my life. How about you guys? I think
[00:01:14.370] [SPEAKER_01]：这么说吧。感觉我生活中充满了社区氛围。你们呢？我觉得
[00:01:19.390] [SPEAKER_02]: in terms of friendship, yes, there is almost like a micro communities within the friend groups I
[00:01:19.390] [SPEAKER_02]：就友谊而言，是的，朋友群体内部几乎存在着类似微型社群的东西。
[00:01:26.050] [SPEAKER_02]: have of you know, people who like to do certain things. These groups of people like to play
[00:01:26.050] [SPEAKER_02]：你们知道，有些人喜欢做某些事情。这些人喜欢玩……
[00:01:30.790] [SPEAKER_02]: pickleball. These groups of people like to watch movies. But in terms of community
[00:01:30.790] [SPEAKER_02]：匹克球。这些人喜欢看电影。但就社区而言
[00:01:35.870] [SPEAKER_02]: around me that aren't just friends who have been friends for many years. I don't really
[00:01:35.870] [SPEAKER_02]：我身边除了多年的老朋友之外，没有其他关系了。我真的不太了解。
[00:01:41.630] [SPEAKER_01]: have that. That's funny that you say that because I think you specifically crystal are
[00:01:41.630] [SPEAKER_01]：有的。你说这话真有意思，因为我觉得你特别想说的是水晶。
[00:01:46.130] [SPEAKER_01]: great community builder. With this podcast, you have a community, right? That's true actually.
[00:01:46.130] [SPEAKER_01]：很棒的社群建设者。有了这个播客，你就拥有了一个社群，对吧？确实如此。
[00:01:52.770] [SPEAKER_01]: Your crust community we had I remember I was there for the five year celebration.
[00:01:52.770] [SPEAKER_01]：我记得我们曾经拥有一个很棒的社群，我参加了五周年庆典。
[00:01:58.090] [SPEAKER_01]: When I was also thinking about it, crystal, like you're planning your high school reunion.
[00:01:58.090] [SPEAKER_01]：我也在想这件事，克丽丝塔尔，就像你在计划你的高中同学聚会一样。
[00:02:02.410] [SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge community you're a part of. That's true. So I think you're you're great
[00:02:02.410] [SPEAKER_01]：你所在的群体非常庞大，没错。所以我认为你很棒。
[00:02:07.350] [SPEAKER_02]: at bringing people together. I guess because I see it almost differently because it's like
[00:02:07.350] [SPEAKER_02]：在凝聚人心方面。我想是因为我的看法几乎不同，因为这就像……
[00:02:12.710] [SPEAKER_02]: people that I already know and then building that community is a little different from like
[00:02:12.710] [SPEAKER_02]：我认识的人，然后建立起这个社群，这跟我认识的人有点不一样，比如
[00:02:18.430] [SPEAKER_02]: putting myself out into a community of strangers. If that makes sense?
[00:02:18.430] [SPEAKER_02]：把自己置于一个陌生人的群体中。这样说你能理解吗？
[00:02:24.270] [SPEAKER_00]: I think that's kind of similar to how I see it too. So for example, hanging out with friends
[00:02:24.270] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得我的看法也差不多。比如，和朋友们一起出去玩。
[00:02:29.170] [SPEAKER_00]: that I've known since college or high school or whatever on the weekend is very social and fun.
[00:02:29.170] [SPEAKER_00]：我从大学或高中或其他什么时期就认识的人，周末聚会非常热闹有趣。
[00:02:34.730] [SPEAKER_00]: But I don't necessarily see it like I'm building a community. But if I were to go to
[00:02:34.730] [SPEAKER_00]：但我并不认为自己是在建立一个社区。但如果我要去……
[00:02:39.490] [SPEAKER_00]: my local park, play pickleball and say I know like a bunch of the people who are there,
[00:02:39.490] [SPEAKER_00]：我常去的公园，打匹克球，而且我认识那里很多人。
[00:02:44.570] [SPEAKER_00]: I might feel like yeah, this is a big sense of community because maybe I think that community
[00:02:44.570] [SPEAKER_00]：我可能会觉得，是的，这是一种很强的社区感，因为也许我认为这种社区感
[00:02:49.190] [SPEAKER_00]: is more location based or like it happens to you versus friendships and existing connections
[00:02:49.190] [SPEAKER_00]：更多的是基于地理位置，或者说是发生在你身上的事，而不是基于友谊和现有关系。
[00:02:55.510] [SPEAKER_00]: are something that I keep building upon rather than like creating from scratch.
[00:02:55.510] [SPEAKER_00]：我更喜欢在现有基础上不断完善，而不是从零开始创造。
[00:03:00.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Location is interesting because I didn't even think about like my neighbors really or like
[00:03:00.050] [SPEAKER_01]：地点很有意思，因为我根本没想过我的邻居之类的事情。
[00:03:06.290] [SPEAKER_01]: I have no community in this condo building I live in. I don't talk to my neighbors,
[00:03:06.290] [SPEAKER_01]：我住的这栋公寓楼里没有邻居。我不和邻居说话，
[00:03:12.630] [SPEAKER_01]: we don't know each other, we stay out of each other's way.
[00:03:12.630] [SPEAKER_01]：我们彼此不认识，所以我们尽量避免接触。
[00:03:16.130] [SPEAKER_01]: They all sleep at like 10pm.
[00:03:16.130] [SPEAKER_01]：他们都在晚上10点左右睡觉。
[00:03:17.910] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like building community with your neighbors is low key hard. I have one neighbor
[00:03:17.910] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得和邻居建立良好的社区关系其实挺难的。我只有一个邻居。
[00:03:23.470] [SPEAKER_02]: and my apartment situation is kind of like a duplex. I have like one neighbor I literally
[00:03:23.470] [SPEAKER_02]：我的公寓有点像复式公寓。我只有一个邻居，我实际上
[00:03:29.810] [SPEAKER_02]: share a wall with. And when they moved in, I just could not bring myself to introduce
[00:03:29.810] [SPEAKER_02]：和他们共用一面墙。他们搬进来之后，我实在不好意思向他们介绍自己。
[00:03:35.450] [SPEAKER_02]: myself and say hi. And we've been neighbors for a couple months now. We've never interacted at
[00:03:35.450] [SPEAKER_02]：我跟他打了个招呼。我们做了几个月的邻居了。我们之前从未有过任何交流。
[00:03:41.650] [SPEAKER_01]: all. Yeah, no same. I don't. Yeah, I don't know what it is about neighbors. It's
[00:03:41.650] [SPEAKER_01]：所有。是啊，一样。我不知道。是啊，我不知道邻居之间到底是怎么回事。是……
[00:03:49.550] [SPEAKER_01]: intimidating. But I can see like the distinction that you guys are getting at like, oh, like
[00:03:49.550] [SPEAKER_01]：有点吓人。但我能明白你们想表达的区别，哦，就像
[00:04:08.450] [SPEAKER_02]: I think there is a sense of community when you bring different friend groups together.
[00:04:08.450] [SPEAKER_02]：我认为，当不同的朋友群体聚在一起时，就会产生一种社区感。
[00:04:17.870] [SPEAKER_02]: For example, when you mentioned our like, 50 year anniversary for the podcast,
[00:04:17.870] [SPEAKER_02]：例如，当你提到我们播客的50周年纪念日时，
[00:04:22.830] [SPEAKER_02]: I think it was really cool to just stand there and kind of look and be like, wow,
[00:04:22.830] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得站在那里，看着，然后惊叹“哇”，真的很酷。
[00:04:27.070] [SPEAKER_02]: all these people have now one common like shared thread among them, even though a lot
[00:04:27.070] [SPEAKER_02]：这些人现在都有一个共同点，就像一条共享的纽带，尽管很多
[00:04:33.350] [SPEAKER_01]: of them might not even know each other at all. Yes, totally. Because I met people at that
[00:04:33.350] [SPEAKER_01]：他们中有些人可能根本不认识彼此。是的，完全正确。因为我就是在那儿认识这些人的。
[00:04:38.870] [SPEAKER_01]: party. And yeah, like it was fun to be like, what episode were you on? Or like,
[00:04:38.870] [SPEAKER_01]：派对。是啊，就像问“你参加的是哪一集？”或者“
[00:04:43.790] [SPEAKER_01]: how do you know Jisoo? And how do you know Crystal? You guys are definitely building
[00:04:43.790] [SPEAKER_01]：你是怎么认识Jisoo的？又是怎么认识Crystal的？你们俩肯定在努力建立关系。
[00:04:47.210] [SPEAKER_00]: a community. So Michelle, you did mention that right now you're feeling strong community
[00:04:47.210] [SPEAKER_00]：一个社区。米歇尔，你刚才提到你现在感受到了强烈的社区归属感。
[00:04:52.190] [SPEAKER_00]: vibes. I feel like myself and Crystal maybe we're not quite to that extent yet. But I am
[00:04:52.190] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉。我觉得我和Crystal可能还没到那种程度。但我确实是。
[00:04:57.250] [SPEAKER_00]: really curious to hear what kind of things that are happening in your life that bring the most
[00:04:57.250] [SPEAKER_00]：我很好奇你生活中正在发生的哪些事情给你带来最大的满足感。
[00:05:01.370] [SPEAKER_01]: community vibes. I think it helps to live in the city, like in SF, where I feel like there
[00:05:01.370] [SPEAKER_01]：社区氛围。我觉得住在城市里很有帮助，比如旧金山，在那里我感觉……
[00:05:09.050] [SPEAKER_01]: is like a strong sense of SF pride. Like you know how the media says things about the city that
[00:05:09.050] [SPEAKER_01]：就像强烈的旧金山自豪感。你知道媒体是如何报道这座城市的，
[00:05:16.950] [SPEAKER_01]: usually really negative about crime, about homelessness. And I see it but like the
[00:05:16.950] [SPEAKER_01]：通常对犯罪和无家可归问题都非常负面。我看到了，但就像……
[00:05:21.970] [SPEAKER_01]: people in SF also including me really love it here. We like see the beauty in the city.
[00:05:21.970] [SPEAKER_01]：包括我在内的旧金山人都很喜欢这里。我们喜欢欣赏这座城市的美景。
[00:05:27.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is like a good community to mention, but like I'm in r slash SF,
[00:05:27.830] [SPEAKER_01]：我不知道在这里提一下是否合适，但我在 r/SF 社区，
[00:05:34.410] [SPEAKER_01]: loves the community there not that I'm active, I just lurk. It's full of positive stuff most of
[00:05:34.410] [SPEAKER_01]：我很喜欢那里的社区，虽然我不怎么活跃，只是潜水。那里大部分都是积极向上的内容。
[00:05:40.290] [SPEAKER_01]: the time like about how beautiful our city is and how much we love it. The events that are
[00:05:40.290] [SPEAKER_01]：比如，我们会谈论我们的城市有多么美丽，我们有多么热爱它。还有一些活动是
[00:05:45.010] [SPEAKER_01]: going on. I try to keep up with fun community based events that are happening in the city and
[00:05:45.010] [SPEAKER_01]：正在进行中。我努力关注城市里发生的各种有趣的社区活动，
[00:05:50.870] [SPEAKER_01]: I try my best to make it out. The city is one that I really feel part of. I like that you
[00:05:50.870] [SPEAKER_01]：我尽力想办法离开这里。这座城市让我感觉自己真正融入其中。我喜欢你
[00:05:56.450] [SPEAKER_02]: brought up Reddit because I do think there is some value in like online communities.
[00:05:56.450] [SPEAKER_02]：之所以提到Reddit，是因为我认为在线社区确实有一些价值。
[00:06:01.990] [SPEAKER_02]: I love to read subreddits after I watch TV show episodes. And that's kind of community.
[00:06:01.990] [SPEAKER_02]：我喜欢在看完电视剧后浏览Reddit上的子版块。那也算是一种社区吧。
[00:06:08.390] [SPEAKER_02]: You're like, Oh my god, these people are thinking the same thing as me. Although I'm
[00:06:08.390] [SPEAKER_02]：你会想，天哪，这些人跟我想的一样。虽然我
[00:06:12.390] [SPEAKER_00]: just a lurker. So yes, yeah, I can't be posting. Maybe a lot of it is just like we have these
[00:06:12.390] [SPEAKER_00]：我只是个潜水员。所以，是的，我不能发帖。也许很多时候就像我们这样……
[00:06:21.250] [SPEAKER_00]: shared experiences with people around us. And that's not always super common or like easy to
[00:06:21.250] [SPEAKER_00]：与我们周围的人分享经历。但这并不总是很常见，也不容易做到。
[00:06:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]: find. So I also to feel like almost like a sense of home when I see people who have
[00:06:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]：找到。所以当我看到那些有……的人时，我也感觉像回到了家一样。
[00:06:32.410] [SPEAKER_00]: watched the same thing as me or live in a similar place and care about it as much
[00:06:32.410] [SPEAKER_00]：看过和我一样的东西，或者住在类似的地方，并且同样关心它的人。
[00:06:35.970] [SPEAKER_00]: as I do. So that is probably huge. And I don't know, it's kind of interesting. I used
[00:06:35.970] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我一样。所以这可能意义重大。而且，我不知道，这挺有意思的。我用
[00:06:41.170] [SPEAKER_00]: to live in San Francisco, but that was during peak COVID time. So it wasn't very community
[00:06:41.170] [SPEAKER_00]：住在旧金山，但那是在新冠疫情高峰期。所以社区氛围不太好。
[00:06:46.810] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling like I remember Crystal and I would joke, I would just look into people's
[00:06:46.810] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉就像我记得Crystal，我们以前会开玩笑，我会偷偷查看别人的……
[00:06:50.710] [SPEAKER_00]: apartments. And that was like community building for me because I'd be like you exist too.
[00:06:50.710] [SPEAKER_00]：公寓。对我来说，这就像是建立社区一样，因为我会想，你也存在。
[00:06:59.050] [SPEAKER_00]: Like guys, leave your lights on after dark. But now I live in a kind of a smaller city
[00:06:59.050] [SPEAKER_00]：比如，各位，天黑以后记得开灯。但我现在住在一个比较小的城市。
[00:07:05.510] [SPEAKER_00]: that's very suburban. And I also feel a little bit of a community vibe here too. So I guess
[00:07:05.510] [SPEAKER_00]：这很有郊区的感觉。而且我也感觉到这里有点社区氛围。所以我想
[00:07:11.790] [SPEAKER_00]: even if I'm not in like a very metro area, I still feel like being in a slightly smaller
[00:07:11.790] [SPEAKER_00]：即使我不在那种大都市地区，我仍然感觉身处一个稍微小一点的地方。
[00:07:16.650] [SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, I can see other people also care about this community. Yeah, I've done things
[00:07:16.650] [SPEAKER_00]：在这个社区，我看得出来其他人也很关心这个社区。是的，我做过一些事。
[00:07:21.390] [SPEAKER_01]: in SF that I wouldn't have done back in my hometown. Like I participated in like
[00:07:21.390] [SPEAKER_01]：在旧金山，我做了一些在我的家乡不会做的事情。比如我参与了……
[00:07:26.550] [SPEAKER_01]: city cleanups, we all wore vests and like picked up trash in our neighborhood. And that was
[00:07:26.550] [SPEAKER_01]：城市清洁活动，我们都穿着背心，在社区里捡垃圾。就是这样。
[00:07:33.310] [SPEAKER_01]: really sweet. A few parks just open near me and they'll have events like they'll have like a
[00:07:33.310] [SPEAKER_01]：真不错。我家附近几个公园刚开放，他们会举办一些活动，比如……
[00:07:38.810] [SPEAKER_01]: flea market or like, oh, fuck you guys are just trying to run club. Oh my god. Like for this
[00:07:38.810] [SPEAKER_01]：跳蚤市场？哦，我去，你们这是想搞个俱乐部啊。我的天。点赞支持这个
[00:07:43.850] [SPEAKER_01]: part of the city. Yeah, that's I mean, I haven't really made friends yet. But it is a great
[00:07:43.850] [SPEAKER_01]：这是城市的一部分。是的，我的意思是，我还没真正交到朋友。但这真是一个很棒的地方。
[00:07:49.590] [SPEAKER_01]: place to make friends. Yeah. And like date apparently. But like that's just really fun
[00:07:49.590] [SPEAKER_01]：交朋友的好地方。是啊。好像还能约会。不过那真的很有趣。
[00:07:54.850] [SPEAKER_01]: too. Like people all over the city come just to run five miles together. And everyone's
[00:07:54.850] [SPEAKER_01]：也是。就像全市各地的人都来一起跑五英里。而且每个人
[00:07:59.530] [SPEAKER_02]: nice and welcoming and open. Oh my god, I've also heard that run clubs are like the new
[00:07:59.530] [SPEAKER_02]：真好，热情又开放。我的天，我还听说跑步俱乐部就像新的……
[00:08:07.290] [SPEAKER_01]: way to date. Yeah, like it makes so much sense. You have something in common where
[00:08:07.290] [SPEAKER_01]：真是太合适了。是啊，这很有道理。你们有共同点，那就是
[00:08:14.290] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe you don't love I don't love running but I'm willing to run
[00:08:14.290] [SPEAKER_01]：也许你不喜欢跑步，我也不喜欢跑步，但我愿意跑。
[00:08:20.010] [SPEAKER_01]: at that time and moment with 200 other people. So 200 community. Wait, so walk us through
[00:08:20.010] [SPEAKER_01]：当时还有其他200人。所以是200人的社区。等等，给我们讲讲吧。
[00:08:27.810] [SPEAKER_02]: a running club meeting. Have you attended one yet? Yes, we meet up at the baseball stadium.
[00:08:27.810] [SPEAKER_02]：跑步俱乐部聚会。你参加过吗？是的，我们在棒球场集合。
[00:08:33.550] [SPEAKER_01]: There's music playing. We do warm ups together. You know, like, like jumping,
[00:08:33.550] [SPEAKER_01]：这里有音乐。我们一起做热身运动。你知道，比如，比如跳跃，
[00:08:41.630] [SPEAKER_01]: like jumping and stretching and stuff. And then they're just like, all right, let's go.
[00:08:41.630] [SPEAKER_01]：比如跳跃、伸展之类的。然后他们就说，好了，我们走吧。
[00:08:46.870] [SPEAKER_01]: And then after every mile, we stop at a park and we do more exercises together. But the
[00:08:46.870] [SPEAKER_01]：然后每跑完一英里，我们就会在公园停下来，一起做一些运动。但是
[00:08:53.270] [SPEAKER_01]: time people have like speakers on their backs, like playing music. And like on the way you go
[00:08:53.270] [SPEAKER_01]：有时候人们会背着音箱，就像在播放音乐一样。就像你一路走来一样。
[00:09:00.770] [SPEAKER_01]: at your own pace and they're kind of like, no one gets left behind. But sometimes I wish
[00:09:00.770] [SPEAKER_01]：按照你自己的节奏来，他们就像是说，不会有人掉队。但有时候我希望
[00:09:04.570] [SPEAKER_01]: they would leave me behind. Oh, yeah, yeah. So there's time to talk and stuff after every
[00:09:04.570] [SPEAKER_01]：他们会把我丢下。哦，是啊，是啊。所以每次之后都有时间聊天什么的。
[00:09:10.130] [SPEAKER_02]: mile. I see. So it's like you pause at each park so that the like slower crowd can catch
[00:09:10.130] [SPEAKER_02]：英里。我明白了。所以就像你在每个公园都停下来，好让那些走得慢的人也能跟上。
[00:09:16.470] [SPEAKER_02]: up to the faster crowd. And then you like start the next mile or whatever together. Yeah.
[00:09:16.470] [SPEAKER_02]：跟上速度快的人群。然后你们一起开始下一英里或者其他什么路程。是的。
[00:09:21.490] [SPEAKER_01]: At the end, there's a huge high five train. Oh my god. Whoa. The longest high five tunnels I've
[00:09:21.490] [SPEAKER_01]：最后，有个超长的击掌列车。我的天哪。哇哦。我见过的最长的击掌隧道。
[00:09:28.930] [SPEAKER_01]: ever walked through. And then usually they go to a bar. Have I been? No. But you're like, hey,
[00:09:28.930] [SPEAKER_01]：我曾经走过那里。然后他们通常会去酒吧。我去过吗？没有。但你会想，嘿，
[00:09:36.930] [SPEAKER_01]: guys, I got to run. Yeah, I got to go back. Yeah. But yeah, that's a great I felt a great
[00:09:36.930] [SPEAKER_01]：伙计们，我得走了。是啊，我得回去了。是啊。不过，是啊，感觉真棒。
[00:09:42.270] [SPEAKER_01]: sense of community doing that, like seeing different parts of the city, while also
[00:09:42.270] [SPEAKER_01]：这样做能增强社区感，就像看到城市的不同区域一样，同时还能
[00:09:47.280] [SPEAKER_01]: being out of breath with my fellow runners. I actually feel like sports or just any sort
[00:09:47.280] [SPEAKER_01]：和我的跑步伙伴们一起气喘吁吁。我其实很喜欢运动，或者任何运动。
[00:09:56.040] [SPEAKER_00]: of exercise in general is very community building because I went to core power yoga
[00:09:56.040] [SPEAKER_00]：总的来说，运动非常有利于社区建设，因为我参加了核心力量瑜伽课程。
[00:10:01.840] [SPEAKER_00]: a little bit in San Francisco and a little bit where I'm living now. And the community
[00:10:01.840] [SPEAKER_00]：在旧金山有一点，在我现在居住的地方也有一点。还有社区
[00:10:06.820] [SPEAKER_00]: vibes there strong, I don't even know why I don't even have to talk to the people around
[00:10:06.820] [SPEAKER_00]：气氛好强烈，我甚至不知道为什么，我都不用跟周围的人说话。
[00:10:10.880] [SPEAKER_00]: me. But I'm just like, dude, we're all here doing the same thing. Like this is
[00:10:10.880] [SPEAKER_00]：我。但我当时就想，老兄，我们都在做同样的事情。就像这样
[00:10:14.720] [SPEAKER_00]: fucking insane. Yeah, or my husband plays volleyball sometimes. And these are like huge
[00:10:14.720] [SPEAKER_00]：简直疯了。是啊，或者我老公有时候打排球。这些球都好大。
[00:10:20.480] [SPEAKER_00]: organized tournaments with like hundreds of people, some people in like matching shirts
[00:10:20.480] [SPEAKER_00]：组织有数百人参加的比赛，有些人还穿着统一的T恤。
[00:10:25.340] [SPEAKER_00]: and stuff. And I'm like, this is this is us like we're out here. Speaking of sports,
[00:10:25.340] [SPEAKER_00]：诸如此类。我就想，这就是我们，就像我们现在这样。说到体育，
[00:10:30.540] [SPEAKER_01]: like I, Andy made me join frisbee league with him. So have I played frisbee before? No,
[00:10:30.540] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我一样，安迪拉着我一起加入了飞盘联赛。那我以前玩过飞盘吗？没有。
[00:10:37.500] [SPEAKER_01]: but I joined and I didn't grow up playing group sports, team sports. But I think frisbee is
[00:10:37.500] [SPEAKER_01]：但我加入了，而我从小就没有参加过团体运动或团队运动。但我认为飞盘是
[00:10:45.060] [SPEAKER_01]: like the perfect one to start on because everyone is super friendly. And they're willing
[00:10:45.060] [SPEAKER_01]：这里简直是完美的起点，因为每个人都超级友好。而且他们都很乐于助人。
[00:10:49.500] [SPEAKER_01]: to teach me and ultimate is really cheesy in the way that it's all about the spirit of
[00:10:49.500] [SPEAKER_01]：教我极限飞盘其实挺俗气的，因为它完全关乎精神。
[00:10:55.020] [SPEAKER_01]: the game, quote unquote, the spirit of the game. For every game, we have a spirit winner
[00:10:55.020] [SPEAKER_01]：比赛，或者说，比赛的精神。每场比赛，我们都会评选出一位精神赢家。
[00:11:00.160] [SPEAKER_01]: on each team. You pick a spirit winner, you chant to the other team, you like come up with
[00:11:00.160] [SPEAKER_01]：每个队伍都要选出一个精神冠军，然后向对方队伍喊口号，比如……
[00:11:06.380] [SPEAKER_01]: a chant to encourage the other team win or lose. So that I felt like very, it was very
[00:11:06.380] [SPEAKER_01]：一种鼓励对方球队赢球或输球的口号。所以我感觉非常，非常
[00:11:12.420] [SPEAKER_01]: welcoming and open despite being a newbie. That's nice. I think that's also a good one
[00:11:12.420] [SPEAKER_01]：虽然是新手，但很热情友好。这很好。我觉得这也不错。
[00:11:16.960] [SPEAKER_02]: because ultimate frisbee isn't really like a high school sport, at least in the Bay
[00:11:16.960] [SPEAKER_02]：因为极限飞盘并不像高中体育运动那样普及，至少在湾区是这样。
[00:11:20.920] [SPEAKER_02]: from our experiences. So I feel like everyone is slightly on more even footing.
[00:11:20.920] [SPEAKER_02]：根据我们的经验，我觉得大家现在都站在更公平的起跑线上了。
[00:11:26.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Crystal, these people have been playing. Okay, we began in a circle and they'd be
[00:11:26.640] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，克丽丝塔尔，这些人一直在玩。好吧，我们一开始围成一个圈，然后他们会……
[00:11:32.420] [SPEAKER_01]: everybody tell us how much experience you have playing frisbee. And people would be like,
[00:11:32.420] [SPEAKER_01]：大家说说自己玩飞盘有多少经验吧。然后大家就会说，
[00:11:36.740] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing for 30 years and I feel like it gets to me. I'd be like,
[00:11:36.740] [SPEAKER_01]：我玩了30年了，感觉这事儿挺让我难受的。我会想，
[00:11:41.660] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing since September. There's oldies who've been playing their entire lives. So
[00:11:41.660] [SPEAKER_01]：我从九月份开始玩。有些老玩家一辈子都在玩。
[00:11:49.960] [SPEAKER_01]: it was harder obviously to break into that community, even though everyone was really
[00:11:49.960] [SPEAKER_01]：很显然，融入那个圈子更难，即使每个人都很……
[00:11:53.920] [SPEAKER_01]: friendly. But it's like these are dedicated people who have been playing forever. Okay,
[00:11:53.920] [SPEAKER_01]：很友好。但感觉这些人都是非常投入的玩家，好像已经玩了很久了。好的。
[00:12:02.400] [SPEAKER_02]: but even he was really good. Okay, nevermind about being on the same level, but I do think
[00:12:02.400] [SPEAKER_02]：但他确实很厉害。好吧，先不说我们水平差不多，但我确实觉得
[00:12:09.880] [SPEAKER_02]: rec sports and like rec leagues are definitely super fun. I did one in New York once it was
[00:12:09.880] [SPEAKER_02]：业余体育运动和类似的业余联赛绝对超级好玩。我以前在纽约参加过一次，感觉很棒。
[00:12:16.100] [SPEAKER_02]: like beach volleyball. And I think because like it's a team sport, whether or not you
[00:12:16.100] [SPEAKER_02]：就像沙滩排球一样。我觉得是因为它是一项团队运动，无论你是否……
[00:12:21.500] [SPEAKER_02]: win or lose, you can literally see you and your friends improving even on that exact game
[00:12:21.500] [SPEAKER_02]：无论输赢，你都能真切地看到你和你的朋友在那场游戏中取得进步。
[00:12:29.200] [SPEAKER_02]: and then everyone's just so much more hyped up after the game ends. It's like, oh my god,
[00:12:29.200] [SPEAKER_02]：然后比赛结束后，每个人都更加兴奋了。就像，我的天哪，
[00:12:34.080] [SPEAKER_02]: hey guys, if we just put in like one hour of practice, we could annihilate everyone in this
[00:12:34.080] [SPEAKER_02]：嘿，伙计们，如果我们花一个小时练习，我们就能横扫所有人。
[00:12:38.640] [SPEAKER_02]: league. And then we're like, dude, yeah, like we should totally meet up over the
[00:12:38.640] [SPEAKER_02]：联赛。然后我们就说，兄弟，是啊，我们应该好好聚聚。
[00:12:42.940] [SPEAKER_02]: over the week and like practice so we can win next week. Or if we win the game,
[00:12:42.940] [SPEAKER_02]：这周我们都要练习，这样下周才能赢。或者如果我们赢了比赛，
[00:12:47.140] [SPEAKER_02]: it's just like, oh my god, like we improved so much. Look at us go. And I feel like
[00:12:47.140] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天哪，我们进步太大了。看看我们现在的水平。我觉得
[00:12:51.880] [SPEAKER_02]: that is just like a really great feeling that makes everyone feel connected.
[00:12:51.880] [SPEAKER_02]：那是一种非常棒的感觉，让每个人都感到彼此相连。
[00:12:57.080] [SPEAKER_01]: Totally doing sports with your friends, like improving and like getting sweaty. And like,
[00:12:57.080] [SPEAKER_01]：和朋友们一起运动，提高运动水平，挥汗如雨，感觉很棒。而且，
[00:13:02.920] [SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's that's good. I wish I could do more of that active sports things. I feel like
[00:13:02.920] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，那很好。我希望我能多参加一些积极的体育运动。我觉得
[00:13:10.220] [SPEAKER_01]: besides frisbee, I did like a volleyball league once without knowing the rules of volleyball.
[00:13:10.220] [SPEAKER_01]：除了飞盘，我还参加过一次排球联赛，尽管我根本不知道排球的规则。
[00:13:15.900] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was tough. That's true. I think ultimately sports are still very difficult.
[00:13:15.900] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，那太难了。确实如此。我觉得归根结底，体育运动仍然非常艰难。
[00:13:20.520] [SPEAKER_02]: So like, if you don't feel like it, no need to force yourself into like rec leagues.
[00:13:20.520] [SPEAKER_02]：所以，如果你不想参加，就没必要强迫自己去参加业余联赛。
[00:13:26.440] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. Or, you know, like, I guess speaking of sports, like fan bases are huge communities,
[00:13:26.440] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊。或者，你知道，比如，说到体育运动，球迷群体就是非常庞大的群体，
[00:13:32.240] [SPEAKER_01]: right? Eric, my partner, he and his friends are all Warriors fans or they're all 49er fans.
[00:13:32.240] [SPEAKER_01]：对吧？我的搭档埃里克，他和他的朋友们要么都是勇士队的球迷，要么都是49人队的球迷。
[00:13:39.220] [SPEAKER_01]: I just can't get into that community. That's just not the community for me,
[00:13:39.220] [SPEAKER_01]：我就是融入不了那个圈子。那真的不适合我。
[00:13:43.700] [SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately. But I'm like, I seeing that I, I really admire it. I wish I could play
[00:13:43.700] [SPEAKER_01]：很遗憾。但我看到它，真的很佩服。我希望我能玩。
[00:13:48.840] [SPEAKER_00]: it. But I just can't. I feel like there's also maybe non sports space things that build a big
[00:13:48.840] [SPEAKER_00]：是的。但我就是做不到。我觉得可能还有一些非体育领域的事物也能产生很大的影响。
[00:13:54.440] [SPEAKER_00]: sense of community. So going to like a pottery studio, for example, I heard feels very
[00:13:54.440] [SPEAKER_00]：社区感。比如去陶艺工作室，我听说感觉非常……
[00:14:00.400] [SPEAKER_00]: community building, even though it's not really like a huge group activity, like you're still
[00:14:00.400] [SPEAKER_00]：社区建设，即使它不像大型团体活动那样，就像你仍然
[00:14:05.480] [SPEAKER_00]: all working on your own projects, but maybe similar to yoga. It's like the fact that we're
[00:14:05.480] [SPEAKER_00]：大家都在做自己的项目，但这可能有点像瑜伽。就像我们……
[00:14:09.960] [SPEAKER_00]: all at this one space at the same time is kind of meaningful. And I have to imagine like
[00:14:09.960] [SPEAKER_00]：所有这些同时出现在同一个空间里，这本身就很有意义。我必须想象一下……
[00:14:16.600] [SPEAKER_00]: other art studios or maybe like music sessions, jamming sessions, like that stuff would also be
[00:14:16.600] [SPEAKER_00]：其他艺术工作室，或者像音乐演奏会、即兴演奏会之类的，也算在内。
[00:14:23.100] [SPEAKER_01]: very beneficial. Yeah, I can speak to the clay studio aspect. I only started ceramics like
[00:14:23.100] [SPEAKER_01]：非常有益。是的，我可以谈谈陶艺工作室方面的情况。我刚开始接触陶瓷的时候……
[00:14:29.780] [SPEAKER_01]: a year and a half ago. And I'm still not good at all. But putting in the hours and meeting
[00:14:29.780] [SPEAKER_01]：一年半前。我现在仍然很差劲。但我投入了大量时间，并且参加了会议。
[00:14:36.180] [SPEAKER_01]: people because I think the shared understanding with ceramics among all people who do it at
[00:14:36.180] [SPEAKER_01]：因为我认为所有从事陶瓷创作的人都对陶瓷有着共同的理解。
[00:14:42.220] [SPEAKER_01]: is that it's really hard. And it takes a lot of time, things are never going to go the way
[00:14:42.220] [SPEAKER_01]：那就是真的很难。而且很费时间，事情永远不会按预期发展。
[00:14:48.140] [SPEAKER_01]: you expect it to be. So I think that mutual understanding amongst everyone that we're all
[00:14:48.140] [SPEAKER_01]：你期望如此。所以我认为大家之间的相互理解是，我们都是
[00:14:54.520] [SPEAKER_01]: working like on this art form that is incredibly unpredictable and not in our hands at all.
[00:14:54.520] [SPEAKER_01]：像这样创作艺术形式，它极其不可预测，而且完全不在我们的掌控之中。
[00:15:01.400] [SPEAKER_01]: It's nice. Somehow like just knowing that all of us are putting our butts went to
[00:15:01.400] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉真好。不知怎的，只要知道我们所有人都在为之努力，就感觉很棒。
[00:15:07.380] [SPEAKER_01]: explode in the kiln. It's really good. I am not like fully into the clay community right now,
[00:15:07.380] [SPEAKER_01]：在窑里爆炸。真的很好。我现在对陶艺圈子还没有完全投入。
[00:15:15.500] [SPEAKER_01]: but I've made friends with the clay studio owner. And that's been nice. And I have made some
[00:15:15.500] [SPEAKER_01]：但我跟陶艺工作室的老板成了朋友。这感觉真好。而且我还做了一些
[00:15:21.100] [SPEAKER_01]: a few friends through classes. I keep taking classes so that consistency gets me in
[00:15:21.100] [SPEAKER_01]：通过课程认识了一些朋友。我一直坚持上课，这样才能保持学习的连贯性。
[00:15:27.920] [SPEAKER_00]: and seeing the same people and it helps a lot. Oh, also one thing that I guess we didn't
[00:15:27.920] [SPEAKER_00]：见到同样的人真的很有帮助。哦，还有一件事，我想我们没做到。
[00:15:32.900] [SPEAKER_00]: hear but I think also builds community is church or like religious organizations.
[00:15:32.900] [SPEAKER_00]：我听到了，但我认为教会或类似的宗教组织也能建立社区。
[00:15:38.520] [SPEAKER_00]: And that just makes me think maybe all of this, like you said, Michelle is just like we're all
[00:15:38.520] [SPEAKER_00]：这让我觉得，也许这一切，就像你说的，米歇尔其实和我们所有人都一样。
[00:15:43.080] [SPEAKER_00]: in this together trying to achieve some sort of common goal or acknowledging that there's
[00:15:43.080] [SPEAKER_00]：我们在一起努力实现某种共同目标，或者承认存在某种……
[00:15:49.100] [SPEAKER_00]: some sort of skill set we're trying to build like something that brings us together that
[00:15:49.100] [SPEAKER_00]：我们正在努力培养某种技能，就像某种能把我们凝聚在一起的东西。
[00:15:52.500] [SPEAKER_00]: we can have in common with people who are virtually strangers right until you meet them
[00:15:52.500] [SPEAKER_00]：我们和那些直到见面之前几乎都是陌生人的人，可能会有共同之处。
[00:15:56.680] [SPEAKER_01]: the community. Yeah, I've never been religious myself, but I've always really admired that
[00:15:56.680] [SPEAKER_01]：这个社群。是的，我本人从来没有宗教信仰，但我一直很钦佩这一点。
[00:16:02.980] [SPEAKER_01]: about religion. Like I'll have friends who move to different cities, but every city they go to,
[00:16:02.980] [SPEAKER_01]：关于宗教。比如我有些朋友搬到不同的城市，但他们去的每个城市，
[00:16:08.800] [SPEAKER_01]: even though they go there without knowing anyone, they know that they can go to church
[00:16:08.800] [SPEAKER_01]：即使他们去那里谁也不认识，他们也知道自己可以去教堂。
[00:16:12.980] [SPEAKER_01]: there. They'll find a church there and they'll immediately have a community that'll accept
[00:16:12.980] [SPEAKER_01]：在那里。他们会在那里找到教会，并且会立刻融入一个接纳他们的社区。
[00:16:16.760] [SPEAKER_01]: them. Dude, it's a cheat code. Seriously. You're so right. Yeah. You're like, I know
[00:16:16.760] [SPEAKER_01]：他们。老兄，这是作弊码。真的。你说得太对了。是啊。你会说，我知道。
[00:16:25.060] [SPEAKER_02]: these people will accept me no matter where I go. Totally. Like were you guys in,
[00:16:25.060] [SPEAKER_02]：无论我去哪里，这些人都会接纳我。绝对的。就像你们当时在场一样，
[00:16:30.720] [SPEAKER_01]: not that this is similar to religion, but like sororities or like frats or clubs in high
[00:16:30.720] [SPEAKER_01]：这并非类似于宗教，而是类似于高中里的姐妹会、兄弟会或俱乐部。
[00:16:37.780] [SPEAKER_01]: school or college that built your biggest communities? Honestly, yeah, I was in a
[00:16:37.780] [SPEAKER_01]：你所在的学校或大学里，哪所学校或大学最能建立你的人脉圈？老实说，是的，我当时在……
[00:16:44.600] [SPEAKER_02]: quote unquote professional fraternity in college. I met some people who I probably would have
[00:16:44.600] [SPEAKER_02]：大学里所谓的“专业兄弟会”。我遇到了一些人，我可能本来会……
[00:16:50.520] [SPEAKER_02]: met otherwise and they're like still good friends. So I feel like it is definitely
[00:16:50.520] [SPEAKER_02]：我们是通过其他方式认识的，而且他们现在仍然是很好的朋友。所以我感觉这绝对是。
[00:16:56.280] [SPEAKER_02]: a nice thread to keep. And I know like some people are super into it. So then like even
[00:16:56.280] [SPEAKER_02]：这是一个值得保留的好话题。我知道有些人对此非常着迷。所以，即使
[00:17:02.960] [SPEAKER_02]: after college, they're like, oh my God, I was like, you know, from this chapter or from the
[00:17:02.960] [SPEAKER_02]：大学毕业后，他们会说，哦我的天哪，我当时就想，你知道，从这一章或者从……
[00:17:07.300] [SPEAKER_02]: school of this sorority or fraternity or whatever. And then people literally bond
[00:17:07.300] [SPEAKER_02]：这所学校是姐妹会、兄弟会或其他什么组织的所在地。然后人们真的会建立起深厚的感情。
[00:17:12.180] [SPEAKER_02]: over that. They're like, dude, like I was from this branch or whatever. Yeah. I mean,
[00:17:12.180] [SPEAKER_02]：就那样吧。他们会说，老兄，好像我是哪个分部的似的。是啊。我的意思是，
[00:17:17.760] [SPEAKER_00]: I was in some high school clubs. I feel like high school clubs are a little bit different
[00:17:17.760] [SPEAKER_00]：我高中时参加过一些社团。我觉得高中社团和现在的社团有点不一样。
[00:17:22.500] [SPEAKER_00]: because it's very much like we're all trying to get into college. So maybe the common goal is
[00:17:22.500] [SPEAKER_00]：因为这很像我们都在努力考上大学。所以也许共同的目标是……
[00:17:28.560] [SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily as uniting, but still I think you're right. Like you do just get to meet so
[00:17:28.560] [SPEAKER_00]：不一定能起到团结的作用，但我仍然认为你是对的。就像你们有机会见面一样。
[00:17:34.840] [SPEAKER_01]: many people and that is such a huge perk. In high school, like being in ASB was huge for me.
[00:17:34.840] [SPEAKER_01]：很多人都这样，这真是个巨大的优势。在高中时，加入学生会对我来说意义非凡。
[00:17:43.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Being in the leadership group, like that's where I made like some of my closest friends
[00:17:43.580] [SPEAKER_01]：在领导小组里，我结识了一些最亲密的朋友。
[00:17:49.520] [SPEAKER_01]: because we were just planning dances and putting on rallies and stuff. And that was really bonding.
[00:17:49.520] [SPEAKER_01]：因为我们当时正在计划舞会、组织集会之类的活动。那真的增进了彼此的感情。
[00:17:55.580] [SPEAKER_01]: In college, I wish I had a tighter community. It was harder for me going out of state and
[00:17:55.580] [SPEAKER_01]：在大学里，我希望自己能有一个更紧密的社群。对我来说，去外州生活更难，
[00:18:00.700] [SPEAKER_01]: stuff. So it was kind of really tough in the beginning to find my place, I feel like.
[00:18:00.700] [SPEAKER_01]：事情就是这样。我觉得，一开始找到自己的位置真的很难。
[00:18:06.420] [SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm. When I first got to school, to this day, thinking back, I don't think I really
[00:18:06.420] [SPEAKER_01]：嗯。我刚上学的时候，直到今天回想起来，我觉得我当时并没有真正……
[00:18:13.220] [SPEAKER_01]: found my one place in college, unfortunately, where I made like my deepest closest connections.
[00:18:13.220] [SPEAKER_01]：不幸的是，我在大学里找到了我最亲密、最深厚的人际关系所在。
[00:18:21.140] [SPEAKER_01]: But you made it here? Yeah, it's okay. I'm here. But we out here. Yeah, but we out here.
[00:18:21.140] [SPEAKER_01]：但你还是到了这里？是啊，还好。我到了。但我们身处此地。是啊，但我们身处此地。
[00:18:25.480] [SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't find it in college, I'm a building myself here in the real life.
[00:18:25.480] [SPEAKER_01]：如果我在大学里没能找到它，那么在现实生活中，我正在自己建造它。
[00:18:31.800] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, I had kind of like a similar-ish experience in college where I really was kind of
[00:18:31.800] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，其实我在大学的时候也有过类似的经历，当时我真的有点……
[00:18:37.600] [SPEAKER_00]: like craving that go to network or community. And I think looking back, that kind of sets you
[00:18:37.600] [SPEAKER_00]：就像渴望加入人脉网络或社群一样。回想起来，我觉得正是这种渴望让你……
[00:18:44.860] [SPEAKER_00]: up for more community building in the future because I feel like if socializing or networking
[00:18:44.860] [SPEAKER_00]：未来我更愿意参与社区建设，因为我觉得如果能进行社交或建立人脉，将会更有意义。
[00:18:51.160] [SPEAKER_00]: or having that community always comes very easily, it's not necessarily something that you
[00:18:51.160] [SPEAKER_00]：或者说，拥有那种社群总是很容易的，这不一定是你……
[00:18:55.880] [SPEAKER_00]: chase or it may not even be something where you know how to build it up in like a constructive way.
[00:18:55.880] [SPEAKER_00]：追逐，或者甚至可能不是你知道如何以建设性的方式去建立它的事情。
[00:19:02.340] [SPEAKER_00]: But when you do have those feelings of like isolation or anything like that,
[00:19:02.340] [SPEAKER_00]：但是当你感到孤独或其他类似的情绪时，
[00:19:06.020] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it sets you up to be like a good community leader almost.
[00:19:06.020] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这能让你成为一位优秀的社区领导者。
[00:19:09.440] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really great point. I think, yeah, in college, since I was trying really hard
[00:19:09.440] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，你说得很有道理。我想，是的，在大学的时候，因为我当时真的很努力。
[00:19:14.520] [SPEAKER_01]: to find it, you're right, it made me like crave it more, I guess. And now in my adult life,
[00:19:14.520] [SPEAKER_01]：找到它之后，你说得对，这让我更加渴望它了。现在，在我成年后的生活中，
[00:19:19.100] [SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot more control over things and I'm like more real as an established as a human.
[00:19:19.100] [SPEAKER_01]：我对事情的掌控力更强了，作为一个人，我感觉自己更真实、更成熟了。
[00:19:26.400] [SPEAKER_01]: It's easier now, for sure. I can be a leader in my own community, whatever.
[00:19:26.400] [SPEAKER_01]：现在肯定容易多了。我可以成为自己社区的领导者，随便什么都行。
[00:19:31.820] [SPEAKER_02]: I think also as we're getting older and becoming more established and comfortable in our skin,
[00:19:31.820] [SPEAKER_02]：我认为随着年龄增长，我们越来越成熟稳重，也越来越自在自信，
[00:19:38.940] [SPEAKER_02]: we start to realize the untapped potential of some of our hobbies or interests and how that
[00:19:38.940] [SPEAKER_02]：我们开始意识到我们的一些爱好或兴趣中蕴藏着尚未开发的潜力，以及这如何……
[00:19:46.380] [SPEAKER_02]: can turn into some sort of community building or just like joining community.
[00:19:46.380] [SPEAKER_02]：可以发展成某种形式的社区建设，或者就像加入社区一样。
[00:19:52.700] [SPEAKER_02]: I think like I've even found some communities at work, if your company is pretty big,
[00:19:52.700] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我甚至在工作中也找到了一些社群，如果你的公司规模很大的话，
[00:19:59.180] [SPEAKER_02]: groups naturally form where people are like, hey, we're interested in basketball,
[00:19:59.180] [SPEAKER_02]：当人们对篮球感兴趣时，群体自然而然地就会形成。
[00:20:03.080] [SPEAKER_02]: let's play pick up basketball every Tuesday during our lunch hour.
[00:20:03.080] [SPEAKER_02]：我们每周二午休时间一起打篮球吧。
[00:20:08.040] [SPEAKER_02]: There's just so many random things. I think like at my work, there's a group of
[00:20:08.040] [SPEAKER_02]：真是太多随机的事情了。比如在我的工作中，就有一群……
[00:20:12.180] [SPEAKER_02]: Porsche enthusiasts, I know, right? Or like photography people or even wine and spirits
[00:20:12.180] [SPEAKER_02]：保时捷爱好者，我知道，对吧？或者像摄影爱好者，甚至是葡萄酒和烈酒爱好者。
[00:20:20.500] [SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that. And I think it's pretty cool because you don't always get to see every
[00:20:20.500] [SPEAKER_02]：诸如此类的事情。我觉得这很酷，因为你并不总是能看到所有的一切。
[00:20:26.840] [SPEAKER_02]: organization within your company, especially if it's a big one. So then through these
[00:20:26.840] [SPEAKER_02]：公司内部的组织架构，尤其是大型公司。因此，通过这些……
[00:20:32.780] [SPEAKER_02]: little niche groups, you can meet a lot of new people.
[00:20:32.780] [SPEAKER_02]：在小众群体中，你可以结识很多新朋友。
[00:20:36.620] [SPEAKER_01]: That's cool. I wish I worked for a pretty big company and they don't,
[00:20:36.620] [SPEAKER_01]：那太好了。我希望我能在一家大公司工作，可惜他们不是。
[00:20:41.400] [SPEAKER_02]: people are not cool like that. You should look through like your Slack channels.
[00:20:41.400] [SPEAKER_02]：人们没那么好说话。你应该看看你的 Slack 频道。
[00:20:46.160] [SPEAKER_01]: Dude, we're not on Slack, we're on Teams. That's what makes it hard. Teams is so lame.
[00:20:46.160] [SPEAKER_01]：兄弟，我们不用Slack，我们用的是Teams。这就是难点所在。Teams太烂了。
[00:20:53.160] [SPEAKER_02]: It's because like we have Google groups, so you can literally just like search
[00:20:53.160] [SPEAKER_02]：因为我们有谷歌群组，所以你可以直接搜索。
[00:20:57.260] [SPEAKER_02]: a keyword and then sometimes these groups will pop up and you're like, oh,
[00:20:57.260] [SPEAKER_02]：一个关键词，然后有时候这些群组就会出现，你会想，哦，
[00:21:00.560] [SPEAKER_02]: actually there was a group for this. I'm jealous. I need something like that
[00:21:00.560] [SPEAKER_02]：其实有个专门讨论这个的群组。我好羡慕。我也需要这样一个群组。
[00:21:04.360] [SPEAKER_00]: where I work. Well, I guess pivoting from things that do feel very community building.
[00:21:04.360] [SPEAKER_00]：我工作的地方。嗯，我想应该是从那些感觉很能促进社区建设的事情转向其他事情吧。
[00:21:10.300] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys think that there are things that detract from a sense of community?
[00:21:10.300] [SPEAKER_00]：你们觉得有哪些因素会削弱社区意识？
[00:21:14.900] [SPEAKER_01]: When I was thinking about this question, I was talking to Eric, we got to like our dorms.
[00:21:14.900] [SPEAKER_01]：当我思考这个问题的时候，我和埃里克聊起了我们的宿舍，我们都很喜欢我们的宿舍。
[00:21:20.240] [SPEAKER_01]: He went to another school. He went to Ohio State. I went to Illinois.
[00:21:20.240] [SPEAKER_01]：他去了另一所学校。他去了俄亥俄州立大学。我去了伊利诺伊大学。
[00:21:22.940] [SPEAKER_01]: The first time he visited me, he was like, your dorm is so boring. I was like, oh,
[00:21:22.940] [SPEAKER_01]：他第一次来看我的时候，就说，你的宿舍真无聊。我当时就想，哦，
[00:21:29.020] [SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, you're right. I was in substance free housing.
[00:21:29.020] [SPEAKER_01]：我当时就想，是啊，你说得对。我当时住在无毒品宿舍。
[00:21:33.660] [SPEAKER_01]: And like he was like, everyone's doors are closed. Like how do you make friends?
[00:21:33.660] [SPEAKER_01]：就像他当时说的，所有人的大门都紧闭着。那该怎么交朋友呢？
[00:21:37.340] [SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and then like the guys and girls are separated on each floor.
[00:21:37.340] [SPEAKER_01]：然后我就想，男女生在每一层都是分开的。
[00:21:41.600] [SPEAKER_01]: And like, I realized my dorm is pretty lame. I guess people just, if you're a freshman
[00:21:41.600] [SPEAKER_01]：然后我发现我的宿舍挺烂的。我觉得大家，如果你是大一新生的话……
[00:21:47.960] [SPEAKER_01]: and you live in a dorm, you really have to lean into like the keeping your door open
[00:21:47.960] [SPEAKER_01]：如果你住在宿舍，就真的得养成习惯，比如把门敞开着。
[00:21:51.880] [SPEAKER_01]: and greeting people and really putting yourself out there. And maybe that's one of the reasons
[00:21:51.880] [SPEAKER_01]：主动和人打招呼，真正地展现自己。也许这就是原因之一吧
[00:21:56.640] [SPEAKER_01]: why like I didn't have a great start in finding my community in college, because your dorm,
[00:21:56.640] [SPEAKER_01]：为什么？因为我在大学里很难找到自己的圈子，因为你的宿舍，
[00:22:02.940] [SPEAKER_01]: where you live, I was not finding it there. I was in the beginning.
[00:22:02.940] [SPEAKER_01]：在你住的地方，我没找到。一开始我找到了。
[00:22:08.460] [SPEAKER_01]: Because when I visited Eric's dorm, I was like, oh, I see how other dorms are.
[00:22:08.460] [SPEAKER_01]：因为当我参观埃里克的宿舍时，我就想，哦，我终于明白其他宿舍是什么样子了。
[00:22:15.000] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like everyone stops in. Everyone just barges in,
[00:22:15.000] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，就像每个人都会进来一样。每个人都会闯进来，
[00:22:19.020] [SPEAKER_01]: chats, invites you to things. And that was not happening where I was.
[00:22:19.020] [SPEAKER_01]：聊天，邀请你参加活动。而我当时所在的地方并没有发生这些。
[00:22:22.560] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point, Michelle. And I'm not going to lie.
[00:22:22.560] [SPEAKER_02]：米歇尔，你说得很有道理。我不会撒谎。
[00:22:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]: I am also the door closed kind of person.
[00:22:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]：我也是那种喜欢关上门的人。
[00:22:32.480] [SPEAKER_02]: It was painfully obvious one time when like
[00:22:32.480] [SPEAKER_02]：有一次，这一点显而易见，就像
[00:22:36.000] [SPEAKER_02]: I stepped out of my dorm and I realized that like everyone else was kind of friends in my dorm.
[00:22:36.000] [SPEAKER_02]：我走出宿舍，意识到宿舍里的其他人也都算是朋友。
[00:22:41.900] [SPEAKER_02]: But like I was not friends with them.
[00:22:41.900] [SPEAKER_02]：但我好像和他们不是朋友。
[00:22:44.560] [SPEAKER_02]: They were friendly to me, but I just did not like hang out with them.
[00:22:44.560] [SPEAKER_02]：他们对我很友好，但我就是不喜欢和他们待在一起。
[00:22:48.140] [SPEAKER_02]: I was just too like shy or like put forth the effort as well to like talk to them.
[00:22:48.140] [SPEAKER_02]：我当时太害羞了，或者说太懒得主动去和他们说话。
[00:22:54.760] [SPEAKER_02]: I just always kept my door closed. I was in a single.
[00:22:54.760] [SPEAKER_02]：我一直都把门关着。我住的是单人间。
[00:22:57.840] [SPEAKER_02]: I was left to my own devices, which is sometimes dangerous because as my friends have said,
[00:22:57.840] [SPEAKER_02]：我被放任自流，这有时很危险，因为正如我的朋友们所说，
[00:23:03.780] [SPEAKER_02]: it's just very possible for me to like disappear in that case.
[00:23:03.780] [SPEAKER_02]：在这种情况下，我很有可能就会消失。
[00:23:08.560] [SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of exactly what happened.
[00:23:08.560] [SPEAKER_02]：事情的经过大致就是这样。
[00:23:11.140] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree with the whole like doors being closed,
[00:23:11.140] [SPEAKER_02]：是的，我完全同意就像门关着一样，
[00:23:14.480] [SPEAKER_02]: whether that's metaphorically or like physically.
[00:23:14.480] [SPEAKER_02]：无论是比喻意义上的还是字面意义上的。
[00:23:16.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think to be open to community building, you have to like really lean into it
[00:23:16.640] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，我认为要对社区建设持开放态度，就必须真正投入其中。
[00:23:23.120] [SPEAKER_01]: and like be super open minded.
[00:23:23.120] [SPEAKER_01]：并且要非常开放包容。
[00:23:25.700] [SPEAKER_01]: Just be overly enthusiastic, I think, about the thing that connects you all to other people.
[00:23:25.700] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为，只要对将你们所有人与其他人联系起来的事物充满热情就好。
[00:23:33.040] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm also thinking even if there is like a
[00:23:33.040] [SPEAKER_02]：我还在想，即使有类似……
[00:23:37.020] [SPEAKER_02]: local thing that happens for, I don't know, like fruit enthusiasts or something,
[00:23:37.020] [SPEAKER_02]：这是当地一种活动，我也不知道，可能是水果爱好者之类的群体会参加吧。
[00:23:42.140] [SPEAKER_02]: but then they're like super exclusive and they're just like, yeah, you can't join us.
[00:23:42.140] [SPEAKER_02]：但是他们又非常排外，他们会说，是的，你不能加入我们。
[00:23:46.640] [SPEAKER_02]: Unless like you go through this complicated application process,
[00:23:46.640] [SPEAKER_02]：除非你愿意经历这个复杂的申请流程，
[00:23:50.660] [SPEAKER_02]: then it would be very community detracting.
[00:23:50.660] [SPEAKER_02]：那将对社区造成极大的负面影响。
[00:23:53.820] [SPEAKER_00]: Wait fruit enthusiast? That's like the funniest example ever.
[00:23:53.820] [SPEAKER_00]：等等，水果爱好者？这简直是我听过最搞笑的例子了。
[00:23:59.160] [SPEAKER_00]: But I think like both of you guys said, sometimes when I think back on moments where
[00:23:59.160] [SPEAKER_00]：但我觉得就像你们两位说的那样，有时候当我回想起那些时刻时，
[00:24:03.280] [SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted that sense of community but wasn't able to get it,
[00:24:03.280] [SPEAKER_00]：我真的很想要那种社区归属感，但却没能得到。
[00:24:06.820] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of it came from internally,
[00:24:06.820] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得很多问题都源于内部，
[00:24:10.120] [SPEAKER_00]: where maybe I wasn't ready to feel vulnerable and I just wanted to stay feeling comfortable,
[00:24:10.120] [SPEAKER_00]：也许我当时还没准备好敞开心扉，只想保持舒适自在的状态。
[00:24:15.520] [SPEAKER_00]: which is essentially not putting yourself out there.
[00:24:15.520] [SPEAKER_00]：这本质上就是不让自己走出去。
[00:24:18.780] [SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of that comes from like fear of rejection sometimes,
[00:24:18.780] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得很多时候这都源于害怕被拒绝。
[00:24:22.940] [SPEAKER_00]: where it's like a process, like you really have to be like okay to show that you are
[00:24:22.940] [SPEAKER_00]：这就像一个过程，就像你真的需要表现得“好吧”，才能证明你是
[00:24:28.580] [SPEAKER_00]: excited and eager and maybe even more excited and eager than other people out there
[00:24:28.580] [SPEAKER_00]：既兴奋又渴望，或许比其他人更加兴奋和渴望。
[00:24:32.620] [SPEAKER_00]: to like find new friends or build that sense of community,
[00:24:32.620] [SPEAKER_00]：比如结交新朋友或建立社区归属感，
[00:24:35.640] [SPEAKER_00]: which can definitely be scary.
[00:24:35.640] [SPEAKER_00]：这确实很可怕。
[00:24:37.460] [SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of feel like you usually get what you put out there
[00:24:37.460] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我觉得你付出什么，通常都会得到什么。
[00:24:41.420] [SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully that's more encouraging and less discouraging because if you put in the work,
[00:24:41.420] [SPEAKER_00]：希望这能给你带来更多鼓励而不是打击，因为如果你付出努力，
[00:24:47.540] [SPEAKER_00]: it is probably a lot easier to actually find friends or build community.
[00:24:47.540] [SPEAKER_00]：实际上找到朋友或建立社群可能要容易得多。
[00:24:51.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree. You really have to push yourself.
[00:24:51.640] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我完全同意。你真的必须逼迫自己。
[00:24:54.320] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been hosting some events here and there and dude, it's really hard.
[00:24:54.320] [SPEAKER_01]：我最近零零散散地主持了一些活动，老兄，这真的太难了。
[00:25:00.100] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm a really extroverted person. I really like being around people.
[00:25:00.100] [SPEAKER_01]：我是一个非常外向的人。我真的很喜欢和人在一起。
[00:25:03.700] [SPEAKER_01]: But to have to play host to many strangers is exhausting.
[00:25:03.700] [SPEAKER_01]：但是招待很多陌生人是很累人的。
[00:25:12.100] [SPEAKER_01]: I get super anxious even though I love being around people and meeting new people.
[00:25:12.100] [SPEAKER_01]：虽然我喜欢和人在一起，喜欢结识新朋友，但我还是会感到非常焦虑。
[00:25:18.600] [SPEAKER_01]: I am the nights before these events that I host, I am so anxiety ridden
[00:25:18.600] [SPEAKER_01]：每次我主持活动的前一晚，我都会焦虑不已。
[00:25:25.160] [SPEAKER_01]: and for what? Like everyone just comes and has a good time.
[00:25:25.160] [SPEAKER_01]：那又怎样？大家来这里只是为了玩得开心而已。
[00:25:29.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't I'm just planning it. They just show up and enjoy themselves.
[00:25:29.040] [SPEAKER_01]：好像我不参与似的，我只是在计划而已。他们只要来了就玩得开心。
[00:25:33.700] [SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you really have to.
[00:25:33.700] [SPEAKER_01]：但是，是的，你真的必须这样做。
[00:25:36.220] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like me putting on like 200% in order to play host.
[00:25:36.220] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我为了主持节目而付出200%的努力一样。
[00:25:42.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Right and I'm sure there's like the whole all the worries about like
[00:25:42.960] [SPEAKER_02]：没错，而且我确信大家都会担心很多事情，比如……
[00:25:46.260] [SPEAKER_02]: will anyone show up? Will they have fun?
[00:25:46.260] [SPEAKER_02]：会有人来吗？他们会玩得开心吗？
[00:25:48.980] [SPEAKER_02]: Will they notice all the things that I did for them? That kind of stuff.
[00:25:48.980] [SPEAKER_02]：他们会注意到我为他们做的一切吗？诸如此类的事情。
[00:25:53.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in the last event I did, there were actually like too many people,
[00:25:53.640] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，在我上次参加的活动中，人真的太多了。
[00:25:57.500] [SPEAKER_01]: which is a great problem to have but it was also like really scary.
[00:25:57.500] [SPEAKER_01]：这当然是个甜蜜的烦恼，但同时也非常可怕。
[00:26:01.460] [SPEAKER_01]: I hosted a collage club and pottery painting night at my clay studio.
[00:26:01.460] [SPEAKER_01]：我在我的陶艺工作室举办了拼贴画俱乐部和陶艺绘画之夜。
[00:26:07.680] [SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly free and when people see free and they see other people going,
[00:26:07.680] [SPEAKER_01]：大部分都是免费的，当人们看到免费，看到其他人也去的时候，
[00:26:13.880] [SPEAKER_01]: the numbers just keep climbing and climbing. The studio is not a big one.
[00:26:13.880] [SPEAKER_01]：数字一直在攀升。工作室规模并不大。
[00:26:18.520] [SPEAKER_01]: So about 100 people RSVP.
[00:26:18.520] [SPEAKER_01]：大约有 100 人回复参加。
[00:26:21.060] [SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[00:26:21.060] [SPEAKER_01]：哇。
[00:26:22.020] [SPEAKER_01]: There was no 100 people cannot fit in the space you guys like.
[00:26:22.020] [SPEAKER_01]：你们喜欢的空间里并没有容纳100人。
[00:26:27.400] [SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that was hard and at some points like people were on the floor.
[00:26:27.400] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，那很艰难，有好几次都有人倒在地上了。
[00:26:33.280] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[00:26:33.280] [SPEAKER_01]：我的天哪。
[00:26:34.380] [SPEAKER_01]: To like collage and paint stuff with their friends
[00:26:34.380] [SPEAKER_01]：喜欢和朋友们一起做拼贴画和绘画。
[00:26:37.300] [SPEAKER_01]: and I was scrambling to move things aside so people would have space.
[00:26:37.300] [SPEAKER_01]：我当时手忙脚乱地挪开东西，好给人们腾出空间。
[00:26:41.680] [SPEAKER_01]: It all ended up working out but yeah sometimes the cost of building community
[00:26:41.680] [SPEAKER_01]：最终一切都解决了，但有时候，建立社区确实需要付出代价。
[00:26:45.280] [SPEAKER_01]: is a little bit of your sanity.
[00:26:45.280] [SPEAKER_01]：这是你保持理智的一小部分。
[00:26:48.340] [SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what inspired you to throw and host these big community events?
[00:26:48.340] [SPEAKER_00]：那么，是什么促使你举办这些大型社区活动呢？
[00:26:53.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was actually I had two friends.
[00:26:53.040] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，实际上我有两个朋友。
[00:26:56.460] [SPEAKER_01]: They met on TikTok because both of them were commenting saying that SF needs some sort of like
[00:26:56.460] [SPEAKER_01]：他们在TikTok上认识，因为他们都在评论说旧金山需要某种类似的东西。
[00:27:04.420] [SPEAKER_01]: collage community for anyone to come to.
[00:27:04.420] [SPEAKER_01]：欢迎所有人加入的大学社区。
[00:27:08.160] [SPEAKER_01]: Both of them happen to be hoarders.
[00:27:08.160] [SPEAKER_01]：他们俩碰巧都是囤积狂。
[00:27:10.600] [SPEAKER_01]: My friends Nicole and Zai.
[00:27:10.600] [SPEAKER_01]：我的朋友妮可和扎伊。
[00:27:12.680] [SPEAKER_01]: They found free community spaces at sports basement here in the city.
[00:27:12.680] [SPEAKER_01]：他们在城里的体育馆地下室找到了免费的社区空间。
[00:27:17.820] [SPEAKER_01]: You can use their warehouses to host free events.
[00:27:17.820] [SPEAKER_01]：你可以利用他们的仓库举办免费活动。
[00:27:21.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and then when they first started it,
[00:27:21.040] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，然后当他们刚开始的时候，
[00:27:23.380] [SPEAKER_01]: it was like they just laid out all their materials
[00:27:23.380] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉他们就像是把所有材料都摆了出来一样。
[00:27:27.360] [SPEAKER_01]: and just invited people to come.
[00:27:27.360] [SPEAKER_01]：然后就邀请大家来。
[00:27:29.400] [SPEAKER_01]: They said no one showed up the first one.
[00:27:29.400] [SPEAKER_01]：他们说第一次没人来。
[00:27:33.080] [SPEAKER_01]: As people started showing up so this is totally without me
[00:27:33.080] [SPEAKER_01]：随着人们陆续到来，所以这完全与我无关。
[00:27:35.520] [SPEAKER_01]: but as people started showing up it started getting popular
[00:27:35.520] [SPEAKER_01]：但随着人们开始出现，它就开始流行起来了。
[00:27:38.500] [SPEAKER_01]: and like 20 people 30 people and that's when I started coming.
[00:27:38.500] [SPEAKER_01]：大概有二三十个人，我就是那时候开始来的。
[00:27:43.900] [SPEAKER_01]: And since I showed so much enthusiasm they were like dude Michelle why don't you just help us host?
[00:27:43.900] [SPEAKER_01]：因为我表现出了极大的热情，他们就说，米歇尔，你为什么不帮我们主持呢？
[00:27:50.400] [SPEAKER_01]: So I started helping out with them.
[00:27:50.400] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我开始帮助他们。
[00:27:52.600] [SPEAKER_01]: So Nicole and Zai do it monthly at sports basement
[00:27:52.600] [SPEAKER_01]：所以妮可和扎伊每个月都会在运动地下室聚会。
[00:27:55.740] [SPEAKER_01]: and then I just help them out with marketing,
[00:27:55.740] [SPEAKER_01]：然后我就帮他们做市场营销，
[00:27:59.960] [SPEAKER_01]: creating flyers, finding different spaces to host in, social media.
[00:27:59.960] [SPEAKER_01]：制作传单，寻找不同的场地举办活动，社交媒体。
[00:28:05.220] [SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't me who started Collage Club but I'm happy to take it where it has been going.
[00:28:05.220] [SPEAKER_01]：虽然不是我创办了大学社团，但我很高兴能带领它发展到现在的规模。
[00:28:10.880] [SPEAKER_00]: Well that's so cool.
[00:28:10.880] [SPEAKER_00]：哇，太酷了。
[00:28:11.860] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it takes a lot of courage
[00:28:11.860] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这需要很大的勇气。
[00:28:14.220] [SPEAKER_00]: and honestly a lot of like dedication and your personal time to like even just help out
[00:28:14.220] [SPEAKER_00]：说实话，这需要投入大量的时间和精力，甚至需要你抽出个人时间来帮忙。
[00:28:19.580] [SPEAKER_00]: let alone throw and host these events.
[00:28:19.580] [SPEAKER_00]：更别提举办和承办这些活动了。
[00:28:22.780] [SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that's very cool.
[00:28:22.780] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这很酷。
[00:28:24.480] [SPEAKER_00]: I think it's common for people to complain about not feeling a sense of community where they live
[00:28:24.480] [SPEAKER_00]：我认为人们抱怨在居住地感受不到社区归属感是很常见的。
[00:28:28.920] [SPEAKER_00]: but way less common for them to actually do stuff about it.
[00:28:28.920] [SPEAKER_00]：但他们真正采取行动的情况却少之又少。
[00:28:33.260] [SPEAKER_00]: Myself included I would yeah I think it would be hard for me to like throw stuff
[00:28:33.260] [SPEAKER_00]：包括我自己在内，我觉得我很难扔东西。
[00:28:36.900] [SPEAKER_00]: so I admire that a lot.
[00:28:36.900] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我很欣赏这一点。
[00:28:39.120] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah they really just did this on their own accord
[00:28:39.120] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，他们真的是自愿这么做的。
[00:28:42.460] [SPEAKER_01]: like Nicole buys the glue sticks and scissors herself
[00:28:42.460] [SPEAKER_01]：就像妮可自己去买胶棒和剪刀一样
[00:28:46.360] [SPEAKER_01]: to let people come and enjoy it for free
[00:28:46.360] [SPEAKER_01]：让人们免费前来享受。
[00:28:49.500] [SPEAKER_01]: because she was just they just thought SF needed kind of like a screen less
[00:28:49.500] [SPEAKER_01]：因为她只是觉得旧金山需要一种类似无屏幕的环境
[00:28:56.620] [SPEAKER_01]: something to do with your hands just like bring child like creativity back into people's lives.
[00:28:56.620] [SPEAKER_01]：做一些需要动手的事情，就像把孩童般的创造力带回人们的生活中一样。
[00:29:04.980] [SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly girlies you know it's very girl coded
[00:29:04.980] [SPEAKER_01]：你知道，这里大部分都是女生，很有女生的风格。
[00:29:07.780] [SPEAKER_01]: or collage club and like pottery painting and stuff
[00:29:07.780] [SPEAKER_01]：或者拼贴画俱乐部，还有陶艺、绘画之类的。
[00:29:12.960] [SPEAKER_01]: and that's why I've been trying to invite more guys
[00:29:12.960] [SPEAKER_01]：所以，我一直努力邀请更多男士加入。
[00:29:15.640] [SPEAKER_01]: because let's make collage club the next run club you know for people to meet.
[00:29:15.640] [SPEAKER_01]：因为让我们把拼贴俱乐部打造成下一个让你认识新朋友的跑步俱乐部。
[00:29:21.600] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean like guys can make pottery too
[00:29:21.600] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我的意思是，男生也可以做陶器。
[00:29:25.280] [SPEAKER_02]: and guys can stick pictures on paper too
[00:29:25.280] [SPEAKER_02]：男生也可以把图片贴在纸上。
[00:29:28.660] [SPEAKER_00]: and it seems way easier to talk doing collaging than like running.
[00:29:28.660] [SPEAKER_00]：而且感觉边做拼贴画边说话比跑步容易得多。
[00:29:33.480] [SPEAKER_01]: Totally yes no it's so chill yeah I've been trying to encourage a lot more guys to come.
[00:29:33.480] [SPEAKER_01]：完全是，这里很放松，我一直在努力鼓励更多的人来。
[00:29:38.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Like if you change the name from collaging to like vision board creation
[00:29:38.500] [SPEAKER_02]：就像你把拼贴画的名字改成愿景板制作一样
[00:29:43.600] [SPEAKER_02]: would that make more guys show?
[00:29:43.600] [SPEAKER_02]：那样会吸引更多男生来吗？
[00:29:46.240] [SPEAKER_01]: You are so right yeah yeah yeah good idea Crystal.
[00:29:46.240] [SPEAKER_01]：你说得太对了，对对对，好主意，Crystal。
[00:29:52.060] [SPEAKER_02]: But I love that they started it and despite like the first time
[00:29:52.060] [SPEAKER_02]：但我很喜欢他们开始了这件事，尽管就像第一次一样
[00:29:56.260] [SPEAKER_02]: having no one come they still continued and tried and now it's like a huge thing.
[00:29:56.260] [SPEAKER_02]：虽然没有人来，但他们仍然继续尝试，现在这已经发展成一件大事了。
[00:30:01.380] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah people come monthly we have repeat people
[00:30:01.380] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，有人每月都来，我们有回头客。
[00:30:04.480] [SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a big part of it too is like consistency right like having it every month
[00:30:04.480] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得这其中很重要的一部分就是保持规律性，比如每个月都这样做。
[00:30:10.380] [SPEAKER_01]: having people keep coming back and seeing the same faces and names again
[00:30:10.380] [SPEAKER_01]：让人们不断回来，再次看到同样的面孔和名字
[00:30:15.360] [SPEAKER_01]: where you really start to meet people and like look forward to seeing people there is huge.
[00:30:15.360] [SPEAKER_01]：在那里你真的开始认识很多人，并且期待在那里见到别人，这感觉太棒了。
[00:30:20.460] [SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point because I feel like there are a decent number of like one-off things or
[00:30:20.460] [SPEAKER_00]：你说得对，因为我觉得确实有不少像这样的一次性事件，或者
[00:30:25.240] [SPEAKER_00]: events that happen where I feel like you go to it you're like oh that was so cool and
[00:30:25.240] [SPEAKER_00]：有些活动我觉得你去参加之后会觉得，哦，那太酷了，
[00:30:29.160] [SPEAKER_00]: like nothing ever happens ever again so I can see how like having something consistently happen
[00:30:29.160] [SPEAKER_00]：就像什么事都不会再发生了一样，所以我能理解为什么会有持续发生的事情。
[00:30:34.880] [SPEAKER_00]: like something you could put recurring on your calendar could actually build maybe like longer
[00:30:34.880] [SPEAKER_00]：就像你可以添加到日历上的重复事项，实际上可能会逐渐延长……
[00:30:39.340] [SPEAKER_00]: term relationships rather than just like a one-off space for you to meet people.
[00:30:39.340] [SPEAKER_00]：建立长期关系，而不是仅仅提供一个让你结识朋友的一次性空间。
[00:30:44.800] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah absolutely.
[00:30:44.800] [SPEAKER_00]：没错，绝对是这样。
[00:30:46.360] [SPEAKER_00]: Question for you have you ever been to like a not so good event so maybe you went to an
[00:30:46.360] [SPEAKER_00]：问你一个问题，你有没有参加过不太好的活动？比如你去过一个……
[00:30:52.340] [SPEAKER_00]: event and it was supposed to be community building but it didn't have the results that
[00:30:52.340] [SPEAKER_00]：这次活动原本是为了建设社区，但结果却不如预期。
[00:30:57.740] [SPEAKER_00]: you were looking for.
[00:30:57.740] [SPEAKER_00]：你正在寻找。
[00:31:00.240] [SPEAKER_01]: First thing that comes to mind is like going thinking back to college again when I was trying
[00:31:00.240] [SPEAKER_01]：我首先想到的就是回到大学时代，那时我正在努力
[00:31:04.180] [SPEAKER_01]: my fucking hardest to like make friends was going to like 10 different club meetings in a
[00:31:04.180] [SPEAKER_01]：我为了交朋友，最狠的一次尝试就是参加十几个不同的社团活动。
[00:31:10.520] [SPEAKER_01]: week not like anything specifically about but I just remember going to someone being like
[00:31:10.520] [SPEAKER_01]：这周没什么特别的，但我记得去见了某人，就像……
[00:31:15.380] [SPEAKER_01]: this ain't it like I don't remember if it was like specifically like not well organized
[00:31:15.380] [SPEAKER_01]：这不对劲，我不记得是不是特别像，组织得不好。
[00:31:22.500] [SPEAKER_01]: or maybe I don't know the people maybe you know sometimes some people aren't your people
[00:31:22.500] [SPEAKER_01]：或许我不认识这些人，或许你知道，有时候有些人不是你的同类。
[00:31:26.760] [SPEAKER_01]: and I remember like trying to force it being part of this club but after a few times I was
[00:31:26.760] [SPEAKER_01]：我记得当时我努力想加入这个俱乐部，但几次之后我就……
[00:31:32.080] [SPEAKER_01]: like I am not getting anything out of the relationships here I'm not getting out of
[00:31:32.080] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉我从这些关系中什么都得不到，我从中什么也得不到。
[00:31:36.700] [SPEAKER_01]: anything out of the events yeah I don't know I just remember trying to force it
[00:31:36.700] [SPEAKER_01]：除了这些事件之外，还有什么我不知道的吗？我只记得我试图强行去做这件事。
[00:31:41.100] [SPEAKER_01]: in college when I was no one trying to figure out who I was.
[00:31:41.100] [SPEAKER_01]：在大学的时候，我还是个无名小卒，努力寻找自我。
[00:31:46.500] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have some memories of going to really awkward like apartment building events
[00:31:46.500] [SPEAKER_00]：我感觉我有一些参加过非常尴尬的公寓楼活动的记忆。
[00:31:51.580] [SPEAKER_00]: like oh like guys we'll have free food come to the common area and get a donut and meet your
[00:31:51.580] [SPEAKER_00]：伙计们，我们会提供免费食物，来公共区域拿个甜甜圈，认识一下你们
[00:31:58.240] [SPEAKER_00]: neighbors and I remember we went and then it was just like I don't know maybe something about
[00:31:58.240] [SPEAKER_00]：我和邻居记得我们去了，然后就不知道了，也许是关于……
[00:32:04.400] [SPEAKER_00]: like it being an apartment building thing or something about like the main draw being the
[00:32:04.400] [SPEAKER_00]：就像是公寓楼之类的，或者说主要吸引力在于……
[00:32:09.080] [SPEAKER_00]: free donuts or whatever but I remember we grabbed donuts stood there for like a minute
[00:32:09.080] [SPEAKER_00]：免费甜甜圈什么的，但我记得我们拿了甜甜圈，在那儿站了大概一分钟。
[00:32:13.740] [SPEAKER_00]: and then it was so awkward we just like left.
[00:32:13.740] [SPEAKER_00]：然后气氛就变得非常尴尬，我们就离开了。
[00:32:17.240] [SPEAKER_02]: Hmm you know what I think I can relate to that because I think there was an event that was
[00:32:17.240] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，你知道吗，我觉得我能感同身受，因为我觉得也发生过类似的事情……
[00:32:23.780] [SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be like networking or something and the hosts did try I will give them that but I
[00:32:23.780] [SPEAKER_02]：这本来应该是类似网络交流之类的，主持人也确实尝试过了，这一点我承认，但是……
[00:32:30.960] [SPEAKER_02]: think the timing was kind of bad it was like towards the end of the day people were tired
[00:32:30.960] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得时机不太好，感觉快到下班的时候，大家都累了。
[00:32:35.940] [SPEAKER_02]: and then they're like hey we have free like drinks and food and people just kind of went
[00:32:35.940] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他们就说，嘿，我们有免费的饮料和食物，人们就都来了。
[00:32:41.420] [SPEAKER_02]: and like grabbed the food got some drinks and then they're like I'm tired like I don't really
[00:32:41.420] [SPEAKER_02]：然后我就拿了吃的，喝了点饮料，接着他们就说我累了，我其实并不累。
[00:32:46.320] [SPEAKER_02]: want to do these networking activities I'm just gonna leave so it was like half and half you
[00:32:46.320] [SPEAKER_02]：想参加这些社交活动，我就先走了，所以大概一半一半吧。
[00:32:52.360] [SPEAKER_02]: know half of the people were ready and happy to participate and then a good half were also kind
[00:32:52.360] [SPEAKER_02]：我知道一半的人都准备好了，也很乐意参与，还有相当一部分人也很友善。
[00:32:57.680] [SPEAKER_02]: of like um I think I'm gonna go now I've come for the free stuff and that's all I needed.
[00:32:57.680] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，我想我该走了，我来拿免费的东西，这就够了。
[00:33:05.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's what I'm saying like to be fully immersed you have to be all in and like
[00:33:05.040] [SPEAKER_01]：对，我就是这个意思，要想完全沉浸其中，你必须全身心投入，就像……
[00:33:09.660] [SPEAKER_01]: really most of the just like on that's we're just not there we're just there for the free food
[00:33:09.660] [SPEAKER_01]：其实大多数人只是去那里蹭免费食物而已。
[00:33:16.580] [SPEAKER_01]: that reminds you of some some club meetings as well some clubs would be like we're gonna have
[00:33:16.580] [SPEAKER_01]：这让我想起了一些俱乐部会议，有些俱乐部也会说，我们要……
[00:33:22.160] [SPEAKER_01]: free food come join our club and then it was just not it yeah yeah yeah. So maybe the free
[00:33:22.160] [SPEAKER_01]：免费食物，快来加入我们的俱乐部，然后就没意思了，是啊是啊是啊。所以也许免费食物
[00:33:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]: stuff is a trap. Yeah I think maybe sometimes if the free stuff is like a little too good
[00:33:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]：东西都是陷阱。是啊，我觉得有时候免费的东西可能好得有点过头了。
[00:33:34.760] [SPEAKER_02]: if the free stuff is way better than what your event content is then people will come for the
[00:33:34.760] [SPEAKER_02]：如果免费赠品比活动内容好得多，人们就会为了免费赠品而来。
[00:33:41.980] [SPEAKER_02]: food or you know whatever free stuff it is and look around and be like yeah I'm out of here
[00:33:41.980] [SPEAKER_02]：吃点东西，或者你知道的，任何免费的东西，然后环顾四周，心想：好了，我走了。
[00:33:47.740] [SPEAKER_02]: but if it's like similar level then maybe they'll be enticed by the free stuff and
[00:33:47.740] [SPEAKER_02]：但如果水平差不多，那他们或许会被免费的东西吸引，
[00:33:53.460] [SPEAKER_02]: then they'll be like oh this looks interesting like you know there's a balance you have to
[00:33:53.460] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他们会说，哦，这看起来很有趣，你知道，这里面需要找到一个平衡点……
[00:33:57.960] [SPEAKER_02]: like popcorn or something but not donut yeah there's a line yeah exactly or maybe like the
[00:33:57.960] [SPEAKER_02]：就像爆米花之类的，但不是甜甜圈，对，有一条界线，没错，或者像……
[00:34:05.360] [SPEAKER_02]: free stuff has to be more like tied in with the event itself you know like if it's free popcorn
[00:34:05.360] [SPEAKER_02]：免费赠品应该和活动本身更契合才对，比如免费爆米花之类的。
[00:34:12.660] [SPEAKER_02]: we're watching a movie or something right that's the real thought behind it I can
[00:34:12.660] [SPEAKER_02]：我们正在看电影什么的，对吧？这就是我真正的想法。
[00:34:19.060] [SPEAKER_00]: tell when it's fake like yeah I mean so Michelle now you are someone who does have
[00:34:19.060] [SPEAKER_00]：分辨真假，比如，是啊，我的意思是，米歇尔，你现在是一个有……的人。
[00:34:26.500] [SPEAKER_00]: a bigger helping hand or like maybe a bigger I don't want to say responsibility but probably
[00:34:26.500] [SPEAKER_00]：需要更多帮助，或者说，可能需要承担更大的责任，我不想用“责任”这个词，但可能吧。
[00:34:32.400] [SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of like ownership right in trying to have these events that improve the community
[00:34:32.400] [SPEAKER_00]：有点像拥有所有权一样，努力举办这些能够改善社区的活动。
[00:34:37.240] [SPEAKER_00]: around you do you feel like you have any insights that you've kind of encountered
[00:34:37.240] [SPEAKER_00]：在你周围，你有没有遇到过什么让你有所感悟的事情？
[00:34:41.960] [SPEAKER_00]: working with your friends and seeing what works what doesn't yeah there's one like
[00:34:41.960] [SPEAKER_00]：和朋友们一起工作，看看哪些方法有效哪些无效，嗯，确实有这样一个例子。
[00:34:47.500] [SPEAKER_01]: personal insight that I came to it's I get very anxious about these because they're like
[00:34:47.500] [SPEAKER_01]：我个人的体会是，我会对这些事情感到非常焦虑，因为它们就像……
[00:34:51.460] [SPEAKER_01]: and you feel like you said a huge sense of responsibility hosting I'm like maybe I can
[00:34:51.460] [SPEAKER_01]：你感觉自己肩负着巨大的责任，就像在说，也许我可以
[00:34:58.060] [SPEAKER_01]: turn this into some sort of career path for myself a step away from graphic design
[00:34:58.060] [SPEAKER_01]：我想把这发展成我自己的一条职业道路，让我暂时远离平面设计。
[00:35:06.200] [SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know I haven't figured it out at all it's just been a thought in my head that
[00:35:06.200] [SPEAKER_01]：我不知道，我完全没想明白，这只是我脑海里的一个想法。
[00:35:10.580] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been sharing but something about working with small businesses and planning events and
[00:35:10.580] [SPEAKER_01]：我一直在分享一些关于与小型企业合作和策划活动的内容，
[00:35:16.780] [SPEAKER_01]: on social media making content working with small business owners and just seeing people
[00:35:16.780] [SPEAKER_01]：在社交媒体上制作内容，与小型企业主合作，以及看到人们
[00:35:24.760] [SPEAKER_01]: enjoying the event itself is so fulfilling and I would love if I could take it to the next level
[00:35:24.760] [SPEAKER_01]：享受活动本身就让我感到非常满足，如果能更进一步就更好了。
[00:35:31.700] [SPEAKER_01]: like all this is done for free and it's obviously done with the help of my friends
[00:35:31.700] [SPEAKER_01]：这一切都是免费的，而且显然是在朋友们的帮助下完成的。
[00:35:36.640] [SPEAKER_01]: who have the supplies for collaging but if there's a way to monetize it
[00:35:36.640] [SPEAKER_01]：谁有拼贴画的材料，但如果能把它变现就好了
[00:35:42.360] [SPEAKER_01]: and there's a way to somehow make a living off of it that would be sick I think that would be
[00:35:42.360] [SPEAKER_01]：而且还有一种方法可以靠它谋生，我觉得那太疯狂了。
[00:35:48.960] [SPEAKER_01]: really really fulfilling and meaningful to just plan events and be there yeah that makes sense
[00:35:48.960] [SPEAKER_01]：策划活动并亲临现场真的很有成就感和意义，嗯，这很有道理。
[00:35:55.240] [SPEAKER_00]: right now it's like unpaid labor kind of you're paid and like friendship yeah yeah and it's still
[00:35:55.240] [SPEAKER_00]：现在感觉就像是无偿劳动，你得到了报酬，还有友谊，对对，而且仍然如此。
[00:36:00.680] [SPEAKER_01]: like so meaningful but obviously it takes a lot of time and if I could just like step away
[00:36:00.680] [SPEAKER_01]：这很有意义，但显然需要很多时间，如果我能抽身离开就好了
[00:36:08.160] [SPEAKER_01]: from my day job to be able to do this you're like begging for a reason yeah I really am I would
[00:36:08.160] [SPEAKER_01]：从我的日常工作到能做这个，你简直是在乞求一个理由，是的，我真的在乞求。
[00:36:15.640] [SPEAKER_01]: love that if this could get if this gets bigger and bigger like for me to just do it
[00:36:15.640] [SPEAKER_01]：我喜欢这样，如果这件事能越来越受欢迎，我就更愿意去做了。
[00:36:22.740] [SPEAKER_01]: and I guess another insight it's like you really have to show up and really like we
[00:36:22.740] [SPEAKER_01]：我想另一个见解是，你真的必须出现，真的，就像我们
[00:36:31.000] [SPEAKER_01]: we like we talked about in the beginning like and really put yourself out there to talk to
[00:36:31.000] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我们一开始讨论的那样，要真正地走出去，去和别人交谈。
[00:36:34.140] [SPEAKER_01]: new people I've talked to a lot of people just through like the creative spaces and sf or through
[00:36:34.140] [SPEAKER_01]：我通过创意空间和旧金山等途径认识了很多新朋友，也认识了很多人。
[00:36:41.740] [SPEAKER_01]: instagram or something there's a lot of opportunity when I talk to and meet new people
[00:36:41.740] [SPEAKER_01]：在Instagram之类的平台上，我和新朋友聊天、认识新朋友的时候有很多机会。
[00:36:47.500] [SPEAKER_01]: and I just haven't acted on all those opportunities yet because you know it takes
[00:36:47.500] [SPEAKER_01]：我只是还没有抓住所有的机会，因为你知道，这需要时间。
[00:36:52.720] [SPEAKER_01]: a lot of time and effort dedication and brain space and everything that I don't have because
[00:36:52.720] [SPEAKER_01]：大量的时间、精力、奉献精神、脑力以及所有我没有的东西，因为
[00:36:58.540] [SPEAKER_01]: of being an adult but there's like a lot of opportunities out there to build community
[00:36:58.540] [SPEAKER_01]：虽然已经成年，但仍然有很多机会可以建立社群。
[00:37:03.900] [SPEAKER_02]: and I just need to take them I just need to reach out to them yeah and kind of tie it back
[00:37:03.900] [SPEAKER_02]：我只需要接受他们，我只需要联系他们，是的，然后把事情联系起来。
[00:37:09.180] [SPEAKER_02]: to what we just talked about like in terms of detracting from communities I feel like if you're
[00:37:09.180] [SPEAKER_02]：就我们刚才讨论的，比如对社区的负面影响，我觉得如果你是
[00:37:15.160] [SPEAKER_02]: not fully invested and people can like see through your facade then that also detracts from
[00:37:15.160] [SPEAKER_02]：如果你没有完全投入，人们就能看穿你的伪装，那也会对你产生负面影响。
[00:37:21.820] [SPEAKER_02]: you know the community vibe if people are like hey I wanted to come here to talk about
[00:37:21.820] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道社区氛围，如果人们说“嘿，我想来这里谈谈……”
[00:37:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]: collaging and pottery but clearly the host doesn't give a shit then like why would they come back
[00:37:27.180] [SPEAKER_02]：拼贴画和陶艺，但很明显主持人根本不在乎，那他们为什么还要回来呢？
[00:37:34.760] [SPEAKER_01]: right and that's where it takes all the energy out of me is being usually a lot of these events
[00:37:34.760] [SPEAKER_01]：没错，参加这类活动通常会让我精疲力竭。
[00:37:42.260] [SPEAKER_01]: I host are like around dinnertime and I'm not eating dinner because I am locked in
[00:37:42.260] [SPEAKER_01]：我主持节目的时候大概是晚餐时间，但我没吃晚饭，因为我被困住了。
[00:37:48.000] [SPEAKER_01]: and I have to like I don't know I'm a really hangry person as well so to have to like to
[00:37:48.000] [SPEAKER_01]：而且我得说，我不知道，我也是个特别容易饿暴躁的人，所以得说……
[00:37:54.220] [SPEAKER_01]: my angry demon and be like hi welcome like what are you doing today are you new on
[00:37:54.220] [SPEAKER_01]：我愤怒的恶魔会说：嗨，欢迎，你今天在做什么？你是新来的吗？
[00:38:01.100] [SPEAKER_01]: pin potter and you want to collage well things are here and you can do this and then
[00:38:01.100] [SPEAKER_01]：别针陶艺，你想拼贴画，嗯，东西都在这里，你可以这样做，然后
[00:38:06.060] [SPEAKER_01]: I have to answer questions and be like uh again like I said play really enthusiastic host is
[00:38:06.060] [SPEAKER_01]：我得回答问题，然后就像我刚才说的，扮演一个非常热情的主持人。
[00:38:12.640] [SPEAKER_02]: hard but it gets people in dude maybe the move is to the next step is make it into a potluck
[00:38:12.640] [SPEAKER_02]：虽然很难，但确实能吸引人，伙计。或许下一步可以把它变成聚餐。
[00:38:20.240] [SPEAKER_02]: everyone needs to bring their dish totally true me Nicole and I have been brainstorming a ton
[00:38:20.240] [SPEAKER_02]：每个人都需要带自己的菜来，完全正确！我和妮可一直在集思广益，想了很多点子。
[00:38:26.460] [SPEAKER_01]: about like different themes we can do for the lodge club like next month is October maybe we
[00:38:26.460] [SPEAKER_01]：比如我们可以为俱乐部举办一些不同的主题活动，比如下个月是十月，也许我们可以
[00:38:32.980] [SPEAKER_01]: can do like a costume swap or something maybe we can do like a puzzle swap a clothing swap a
[00:38:32.980] [SPEAKER_01]：我们可以玩角色扮演游戏，比如交换服装之类的，或者交换拼图、衣服之类的。
[00:38:40.720] [SPEAKER_01]: lot of swaps but just like have more themes and a dinner swap yes yes potluck yeah yeah
[00:38:40.720] [SPEAKER_01]：交换很多东西，但更喜欢有更多主题，比如晚餐交换，对对，百乐餐，对对
[00:38:47.300] [SPEAKER_01]: food swap yeah stuff like that just to add more complexity to collage I think it's so funny
[00:38:47.300] [SPEAKER_01]：食物交换，对，诸如此类的事情，只是为了给拼贴画增加更多层次感，我觉得这很有趣。
[00:38:56.000] [SPEAKER_00]: because we kind of talked about how when you go to community events you kind of have to like
[00:38:56.000] [SPEAKER_00]：因为我们之前聊过，当你参加社区活动时，你必须喜欢……
[00:39:00.140] [SPEAKER_00]: show up and be on and sounds like it's doubly or triply so for the host there's something so
[00:39:00.140] [SPEAKER_00]：出现并上线，听起来像是双倍或三倍，所以对主持人来说肯定有什么事。
[00:39:07.360] [SPEAKER_00]: like cute about imagining all these people in one room like so eager and happy and like
[00:39:07.360] [SPEAKER_00]：想象一下这么多人聚在一个房间里，都那么热情、那么快乐，真是太可爱了。
[00:39:13.900] [SPEAKER_00]: put themselves out there matching everyone's energy to like max like that's so it's like
[00:39:13.900] [SPEAKER_00]：他们全力以赴，与所有人的能量相匹配，就像那样，所以就像
[00:39:20.020] [SPEAKER_01]: heartwarming you know yes I co-hosted with a friend of mine named Sharon she's a huge
[00:39:20.020] [SPEAKER_01]：很温馨，你知道吗？是的，我和我的朋友莎伦一起主持了节目，她是一位非常……
[00:39:25.440] [SPEAKER_01]: community builder too she hosts a lot of events and does really cool projects we did
[00:39:25.440] [SPEAKER_01]：她也是社区建设者，举办了很多活动，还做了很多很棒的项目。
[00:39:29.760] [SPEAKER_01]: Maj and collage we paired with Sharon and the Majong project just to get the game out
[00:39:29.760] [SPEAKER_01]：Maj 和拼贴画，我们和 Sharon 以及麻将项目合作，只是为了推出这款游戏。
[00:39:36.680] [SPEAKER_01]: there and have more people learn so we did collage on one side and then Majong games on
[00:39:36.680] [SPEAKER_01]：为了让更多人学习，我们一边做了拼贴画，另一边做了麻将游戏。
[00:39:41.240] [SPEAKER_01]: the other side we had like five tables set up and yeah it's like collage you can kind of sit
[00:39:41.240] [SPEAKER_01]：另一边我们摆了五张桌子，有点像拼贴画，你可以坐在那里。
[00:39:46.900] [SPEAKER_01]: by yourself in collage Majong you have to play with three other people yeah the enthusiasm was
[00:39:46.900] [SPEAKER_01]：一个人在大学里玩麻将，你得和其他三个人一起玩，是啊，热情很高。
[00:39:52.820] [SPEAKER_01]: amazing it was like strangers literally sitting down together to learn and play Majong and it
[00:39:52.820] [SPEAKER_01]：太棒了，就像陌生人真的坐下来一起学习和玩麻将一样，而且
[00:39:59.820] [SPEAKER_00]: was so cute kind of reminds me of like those board game nights that I feel like a lot of
[00:39:59.820] [SPEAKER_00]：太可爱了，让我想起了那些我感觉很熟悉的桌游之夜。
[00:40:04.840] [SPEAKER_00]: board game stores host as well sometimes when I pop by one to grab a game like Tuesday
[00:40:04.840] [SPEAKER_00]：桌游店有时也会举办活动，比如我周二去店里买游戏的时候。
[00:40:09.640] [SPEAKER_00]: nights or something at our local one there's like tables and tables of people playing
[00:40:09.640] [SPEAKER_00]：晚上或者在我们当地那家店，有很多桌子都坐满了人。
[00:40:14.180] [SPEAKER_00]: whatever game they're playing and I'm always like oh my god we live in a real city yeah
[00:40:14.180] [SPEAKER_00]：不管他们在玩什么游戏，我总是会想，我的天哪，我们生活在一个真实的城市里，是的。
[00:40:18.680] [SPEAKER_01]: like this is like the people I live around totally yeah I think like we said right just
[00:40:18.680] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我周围的人一样，完全是的，我想就像我们刚才说的，对吧？
[00:40:25.140] [SPEAKER_02]: take the opportunities and show up I mean kind of tying back to like you talking about
[00:40:25.140] [SPEAKER_02]：抓住机会，积极表现。我的意思是，这有点像你刚才说的……
[00:40:32.220] [SPEAKER_02]: the run club I never knew run club was like that I always thought that you just show up
[00:40:32.220] [SPEAKER_02]：我以前从不知道跑步俱乐部是这样的，我一直以为只要去参加就行了。
[00:40:37.580] [SPEAKER_02]: run whatever miles you finish and then you go home so I was like dude what's the deal with
[00:40:37.580] [SPEAKER_02]：跑完你跑完的里程数，然后你就回家，所以我就想，老兄，这到底是怎么回事？
[00:40:42.620] [SPEAKER_02]: run club how are people even dating are they just like huffing and puffing trying to talk
[00:40:42.620] [SPEAKER_02]：跑步俱乐部里的人到底是怎么约会的？他们是不是就气喘吁吁地试图聊天？
[00:40:47.120] [SPEAKER_02]: while they're running but the way you described it I'm like oh okay I can totally see now how
[00:40:47.120] [SPEAKER_02]：虽然他们在跑，但你这么一描述，我就明白了，哦，好吧，我现在完全明白了。
[00:40:52.000] [SPEAKER_02]: that is community building meeting new people and like having fun not just running yeah no I
[00:40:52.000] [SPEAKER_02]：那是建立社群、结识新朋友、享受乐趣，而不仅仅是跑步，是的，不。
[00:40:59.220] [SPEAKER_01]: don't enjoy running at all but I had a lot of fun these past few times and I like will
[00:40:59.220] [SPEAKER_01]：我一点也不喜欢跑步，但最近几次跑步我都玩得很开心，而且我喜欢威尔
[00:41:04.300] [SPEAKER_01]: look forward to it it's just not that I like again I didn't meet anyone I don't remember
[00:41:04.300] [SPEAKER_01]：我很期待，只是我不太喜欢，我又没遇到任何人，我不记得了。
[00:41:08.840] [SPEAKER_01]: anyone's names from run club but just the idea that we're all running together
[00:41:08.840] [SPEAKER_01]：跑步俱乐部里谁的名字都行，但我们一起跑步这个想法本身就意义非凡。
[00:41:14.720] [SPEAKER_01]: through beautiful parts of the city and then hanging out a little bit after
[00:41:14.720] [SPEAKER_01]：穿过城市里美丽的地方，然后稍微闲逛一会儿
[00:41:18.280] [SPEAKER_00]: is really really nice I feel like a lot of this is very necessary too to feel like a
[00:41:18.280] [SPEAKER_00]：真的非常好，我觉得很多东西也非常必要，才能感受到……
[00:41:24.100] [SPEAKER_00]: real person a part of a real society especially in like the online era where sometimes I feel
[00:41:24.100] [SPEAKER_00]：真实的人，真实社会的一部分，尤其是在网络时代，有时我觉得
[00:41:29.980] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I spend an egregious amount of hours every day looking at a screen so just not
[00:41:29.980] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道，我每天花大量时间盯着屏幕，所以就……
[00:41:36.580] [SPEAKER_00]: doing that and seeing people around me who aren't necessarily like close friends
[00:41:36.580] [SPEAKER_00]：这样做，然后看到我身边的人，他们未必是亲密的朋友。
[00:41:40.600] [SPEAKER_00]: is rewarding and getting a little bit like rare and rare unless you put in your own time
[00:41:40.600] [SPEAKER_00]：这很有回报，但除非你自己投入时间，否则会变得越来越稀有。
[00:41:45.640] [SPEAKER_00]: so yes a lot of it is about like building and feeling the community but I think a lot
[00:41:45.640] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，是的，很多时候都关乎社区的建设和氛围，但我认为很多
[00:41:50.780] [SPEAKER_00]: of it is really good for just ourselves as individuals too okay but I have a question for
[00:41:50.780] [SPEAKER_00]：这对我们个人来说也真的很有好处，好的，但我有个问题……
[00:41:55.840] [SPEAKER_02]: because I'm an introvert so like if I were to go to an event and I'm trying to meet new people
[00:41:55.840] [SPEAKER_02]：因为我是个内向的人，所以如果我去参加一个活动，想认识新朋友的话……
[00:42:04.460] [SPEAKER_02]: and you know connect through some sort of common hobby but I feel like there's so many people
[00:42:04.460] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，通过某种共同的爱好建立联系，但我感觉有太多人
[00:42:12.080] [SPEAKER_02]: and maybe they all already know each other like what should I do Crystal the thing is
[00:42:12.080] [SPEAKER_02]：也许他们彼此都认识，那我该怎么办，Crystal？问题是……
[00:42:17.320] [SPEAKER_01]: love to chat Crystal is a yapper like once you get Crystal on one topic she can she can go off
[00:42:17.320] [SPEAKER_01]：Crystal很爱聊天，她是个话痨，一旦跟她聊上一个话题，她就能滔滔不绝地说个不停。
[00:42:25.900] [SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it happen multiple times so I know the initial like reach out is really hard but
[00:42:25.900] [SPEAKER_01]：我见过好几次这种情况，所以我知道最初的沟通真的很难，但是
[00:42:33.220] [SPEAKER_01]: even I find as an extrovert I'm not even usually the one who reaches out at makes the
[00:42:33.220] [SPEAKER_01]：即使是我这样一个外向的人，也发现我通常不是主动与人接触的那个人。
[00:42:38.520] [SPEAKER_01]: initial contact there are always more extroverted people there's always a more extroverted person
[00:42:38.520] [SPEAKER_01]：初次接触时，总会遇到比较外向的人。
[00:42:43.240] [SPEAKER_01]: in the room who will do the initial contact and like do the bringing in of someone so I don't
[00:42:43.240] [SPEAKER_01]：房间里谁负责初步联系，谁负责介绍人选，这样我就不用操心了。
[00:42:50.040] [SPEAKER_01]: know if it's like waiting or kind of wandering around until you find that ultra extrovert to
[00:42:50.040] [SPEAKER_01]：要知道，这感觉是像等待，还是像四处游荡，直到找到那个超级外向的人。
[00:42:57.360] [SPEAKER_01]: bring you in I don't know Crystal I feel like once someone introduces you themselves to you
[00:42:57.360] [SPEAKER_01]：带你进来，我不认识Crystal，我觉得一旦有人向你自我介绍，你就会明白。
[00:43:03.180] [SPEAKER_01]: like you can find a topic easily to connect on that's true I can yap I'm capable of it
[00:43:03.180] [SPEAKER_01]：就像你可以很容易地找到一个话题来聊，没错，我能说会道，我有这个能力。
[00:43:09.840] [SPEAKER_01]: but you know initial contact is hard but yeah no even same as an extrovert speaking just
[00:43:09.840] [SPEAKER_01]：但是你知道，初次接触很难，不过，即使是外向的人说话也一样。
[00:43:16.620] [SPEAKER_02]: wait for the more extroverted I guess the best scenario would be like the host themselves come
[00:43:16.620] [SPEAKER_02]：等等看有没有更外向的人，我想最好的情况就是主持人自己来。
[00:43:24.020] [SPEAKER_02]: over and they're like oh my god this poor introvert over here has no one to yeah yes sir I think
[00:43:24.020] [SPEAKER_02]：结束了，然后他们会说，哦我的天哪，这个可怜的内向者没人陪着，是的，先生，我想
[00:43:28.980] [SPEAKER_01]: that's the biggest I know I mentioned that welcoming people and telling people to sign in on
[00:43:28.980] [SPEAKER_01]：我知道最大的一点是，我提到了欢迎大家并告诉大家登录。
[00:43:33.960] [SPEAKER_01]: the sign-in sheet is the main job but you're right the hosting is actually like I flip around
[00:43:33.960] [SPEAKER_01]：签到表是主要工作，但你说得对，主持工作实际上就像我翻转过来一样。
[00:43:39.080] [SPEAKER_01]: and I'm just like you like fruit I heard some fruit talk right over here too like yeah you're
[00:43:39.080] [SPEAKER_01]：我和你一样喜欢水果，我刚才也听到有人在说水果，对，你也是。
[00:43:47.900] [SPEAKER_01]: exactly right it's like trying to engage everyone yeah that is the most honestly
[00:43:47.900] [SPEAKER_01]：完全正确，就像试图让每个人都参与进来一样，是的，这才是最坦诚的。
[00:43:54.540] [SPEAKER_01]: exhausting part you're so right hosts is so important in doing that I'm like imagining
[00:43:54.540] [SPEAKER_01]：你说得太对了，这部分真的太累了，主持人真的非常重要，我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。
[00:44:00.400] [SPEAKER_02]: you with a mental map you're like okay like fruit talk is over here and like fashion talk
[00:44:00.400] [SPEAKER_02]：你脑子里有张地图，你会想，好吧，水果话题在这里，时尚话题在这里
[00:44:05.520] [SPEAKER_02]: down here like you're like okay who do I move to this section and yeah yeah or I'm like are you
[00:44:05.520] [SPEAKER_02]：就像你在这里一样，你会想，好吧，我该把谁移到这个区域，然后是啊是啊，或者我会想，你是吗？
[00:44:13.420] [SPEAKER_01]: single that person's single too I'm trying to matchmake too I'm working overtime you guys
[00:44:13.420] [SPEAKER_01]：单身，那个人也是单身，我也在努力撮合别人，我都在加班加点了，你们这些人
[00:44:17.680] [SPEAKER_01]: yeah or I'm like your collage looks reminiscent of this like yeah yeah yeah totally oh my god
[00:44:17.680] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，或者说，你的拼贴画看起来让我想起了这个，对对对，完全一样，我的天哪
[00:44:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]: that sounds exhausting it is but also Jisoo loves to matchmake Jisoo me too oh my gosh
[00:44:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]：听起来很累人，确实如此，不过智秀也喜欢撮合别人，智秀，我也喜欢，我的天哪！
[00:44:33.860] [SPEAKER_00]: get together and matchmake all our single friends we should host like a singles night
[00:44:33.860] [SPEAKER_00]：我们应该聚在一起，给所有单身朋友牵线搭桥，举办一个单身之夜之类的活动。
[00:44:38.880] [SPEAKER_02]: you and I can be hosts wow you guys should host like a like a speed dating night of all
[00:44:38.880] [SPEAKER_02]：你和我都能当主持人，哇，你们应该办个速配之夜之类的活动！
[00:44:46.320] [SPEAKER_01]: our single friends eat your crust times collage club eat your collage club eycc singles night
[00:44:46.320] [SPEAKER_01]：我们的单身朋友们，吃你的面包皮时代拼贴俱乐部，吃你的拼贴俱乐部，eycc单身之夜
[00:44:54.420] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah this is amazing yeah but I guess going back to the question of like as an introvert
[00:44:54.420] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，这太棒了，不过我想回到之前关于内向者的问题上来。
[00:45:02.100] [SPEAKER_00]: do you show up and talk like as a shy extrovert I feel like I also feel very similar things
[00:45:02.100] [SPEAKER_00]：你表现得像个害羞的外向者吗？我觉得我也有类似的感受。
[00:45:08.240] [SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like a really easy go-to one is like you just have to look for either one someone who
[00:45:08.240] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得最简单的办法就是找一个这样的人，他/她只需要找其中一个……
[00:45:13.060] [SPEAKER_00]: looks also shy and like chat them up like oh my god isn't this awkward and like you know try
[00:45:13.060] [SPEAKER_00]：看起来也很害羞，跟他们搭讪就像，我的天哪，这太尴尬了，你知道，就是尝试。
[00:45:18.300] [SPEAKER_00]: to get into a conversation or go up to someone who's like holding something or like doing
[00:45:18.300] [SPEAKER_00]：开始与某人交谈，或者走近那个拿着东西或喜欢做某事的人。
[00:45:23.300] [SPEAKER_00]: something be like oh like what is that blah blah so maybe to lessen the burden of the
[00:45:23.300] [SPEAKER_00]: 大概就是“哦，那是什么”之类的，所以也许是为了减轻负担
[00:45:32.080] [SPEAKER_02]: self-service options yes we need to take actions ourselves
[00:45:32.080] [SPEAKER_02]：自助服务选项，是的，我们需要自己采取行动。
[00:45:38.180] [SPEAKER_00]: but honestly this is like very encouraging I think it's very cool to know people who actually
[00:45:38.180] [SPEAKER_00]：但说实话，这真的很鼓舞人心，我觉得认识这样的人很酷。
[00:45:44.540] [SPEAKER_00]: host these kinds of events too and sometimes I've been thinking about it but even in my
[00:45:44.540] [SPEAKER_00]：我也举办过这类活动，有时我会考虑举办这类活动，但即使在我
[00:45:50.200] [SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood sometimes people will put out like a box of lemons or something because they
[00:45:50.200] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候邻里之间会摆放一盒柠檬之类的东西，因为他们
[00:45:55.440] [SPEAKER_00]: can't eat all the lemons on their tree so it'll say like feel free to take some lemons
[00:45:55.440] [SPEAKER_00]：树上的柠檬吃不完，所以它会说“请随意摘一些柠檬”。
[00:45:59.920] [SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like yeah even small stuff like that that takes like very minimal effort can also feel
[00:45:59.920] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我就想，是啊，即使是这种只需要很少努力的小事，也能让人感觉……
[00:46:05.980] [SPEAKER_01]: community building it's so funny that you say that because I have like a bunch of stuff in
[00:46:05.980] [SPEAKER_01]：社区建设，你说得真有意思，因为我有很多东西……

[00:46:15.400] [SPEAKER_01]：我看到其他人也这样做，我觉得你说得太对了，这确实会带来一种……
[00:46:19.800] [SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah people live here in my building yeah so then I feel like there's big stuff you can do
[00:46:19.800] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，是啊，我这栋楼里住着人，所以我觉得你可以做很多大事。
[00:46:27.440] [SPEAKER_01]: and small stuff totally you're right there's like mini-school things that we can put out there
[00:46:27.440] [SPEAKER_01]：你说的完全对，还有一些小东西，比如我们可以推出的迷你课程之类的。
[00:46:33.460] [SPEAKER_01]: to let other humans know that we're alive and breathing all the way to you know the big things
[00:46:33.460] [SPEAKER_01]：让其他人知道我们还活着，还在呼吸，你知道，就是为了那些大事。
[00:46:39.560] [SPEAKER_01]: like hosting and then maybe making a career out of being a community builder but all are
[00:46:39.560] [SPEAKER_01]：比如主持活动，然后也许可以以此为职业，成为社区建设者，但所有这些都是
[00:46:46.540] [SPEAKER_02]: so appreciated I feel like by fellow humans for sure and I think honestly after COVID we're
[00:46:46.540] [SPEAKER_02]：我感觉自己受到了同胞们的感激，而且说实话，我认为在新冠疫情之后，我们……
