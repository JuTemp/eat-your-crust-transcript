[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal.
[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]：大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。
[00:00:16.040] [SPEAKER_02]: This week we have a Gen Z word to talk about. Actually, I don't even know if this is Gen Z. This might be like a
[00:00:16.040] [SPEAKER_02]：本周我们要讨论一个Z世代词汇。实际上，我甚至不知道这算不算Z世代词汇。这可能更像是……
[00:00:22.360] [SPEAKER_02]: millennial word. I think it's HelloFunny and the origin of this word is from Twitch and or the gaming community.
[00:00:22.360] [SPEAKER_02]：千禧一代常用的词。我觉得是HelloFunny，这个词的起源可能来自Twitch或者游戏社区。
[00:00:30.720] [SPEAKER_02]: I would say like probably Twitch because of the emotesense stuff. The word is copium and it's a combination
[00:00:30.720] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得可能是 Twitch，因为它的表情感应功能。这个词是 copium，它是一个组合词。
[00:00:38.860] [SPEAKER_02]: of the word cop and opium. So you could kind of understand it's basically implying that you're holding
[00:00:38.860] [SPEAKER_02]：这个词源于“cop”（警察）和“opium”（鸦片）。所以你可以大致理解，它基本上暗示你持有……
[00:00:49.860] [SPEAKER_02]: on to like coping mechanisms or like hope mechanisms as if it's an addiction like opium.
[00:00:49.860] [SPEAKER_02]：就像应对机制或希望机制一样，就像鸦片成瘾一样。
[00:00:57.740] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this word on urban dictionary, the definitions are quite funny. I mean one is like a
[00:00:57.740] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你去Urban Dictionary查一下这个词，你会发现它的定义相当搞笑。我的意思是，其中一个定义就像……
[00:01:03.980] [SPEAKER_00]: very simplistic one like you said lying to yourself in order to cope with something but this other
[00:01:03.980] [SPEAKER_00]：就像你说的，为了应对某些事情而自欺欺人，这很简单，但还有另一种情况。
[00:01:09.100] [SPEAKER_00]: one it literally calls copium a metaphorical opiate inhaled when faced with loss failure or defeat.
[00:01:09.100] [SPEAKER_00]：它字面上称之为鸦片，是一种在面对损失、失败或挫折时吸入的隐喻鸦片。
[00:01:15.980] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, that's the perfect way to describe it. It's also really funny because there is
[00:01:15.980] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，这形容得太贴切了。而且这真的很有趣，因为……
[00:01:26.040] [SPEAKER_02]: an alternative variation of this word which is just hopium instead of copium. Oh,
[00:01:26.040] [SPEAKER_02]：这个词还有另一种写法，就是把 copium 改成 hopium。哦，
[00:01:31.980] [SPEAKER_00]: but they're like pretty much the same thing. I've also heard this shortened well I guess it's not
[00:01:31.980] [SPEAKER_00]：但它们几乎是一回事。我也听过这种说法的缩写，嗯，我想它不是。
[00:01:38.060] [SPEAKER_00]: really shortened but a lot of times we'll just say cop instead of copium to sort of reference copium
[00:01:38.060] [SPEAKER_00]：虽然很简短，但很多时候我们会用“cop”来代替“copium”，以指代“copium”。
[00:01:45.000] [SPEAKER_00]: but also I guess it literally just is the word cop as well. This word is also so funny as is most
[00:01:45.000] [SPEAKER_00]：不过我觉得它字面上也就是“警察”这个词。这个词也像大多数词一样，非常搞笑。
[00:01:52.740] [SPEAKER_02]: twitch words because it has an embo attached to it. Oh my god. And so the copium meme is like
[00:01:52.740] [SPEAKER_02]：抽搐的词语，因为它附带了一个embo。我的天哪。所以copium梗就像是
[00:01:59.340] [SPEAKER_02]: pretty funny because it's that like pepefrog which is the icon of twitch and he just has this like
[00:01:59.340] [SPEAKER_02]：挺搞笑的，因为就像Twitch的图标Pepefrog，他就有这个……
[00:02:06.160] [SPEAKER_02]: gas mask on and instead of it being linked to oxygen, it's linked to a tank that says copium.
[00:02:06.160] [SPEAKER_02]：我戴着防毒面具，但它没有连接到氧气，而是连接到一个写着“氯胺酮”的罐子。
[00:02:15.000] [SPEAKER_00]: I think his eyes are closer something too. So yeah, I mean, I think the copium. But this one is
[00:02:15.000] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得他的眼睛也更近了。所以，是的，我的意思是，我觉得是鸦片。但这个是
[00:02:21.000] [SPEAKER_00]: a really, really applicable word I think. Anytime there's any sort of competition you're doing
[00:02:21.000] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这个词非常贴切。任何时候，只要你参加任何类型的比赛，这个词都适用。
[00:02:26.360] [SPEAKER_00]: with your friends, some sort of game or even something as simple as someone's favorite sports team
[00:02:26.360] [SPEAKER_00]：和朋友们一起玩玩游戏，或者哪怕只是聊聊你们最喜欢的运动队。
[00:02:31.560] [SPEAKER_00]: losing in a game that week, it's just such an easy word to pull out and be like copium. So true
[00:02:31.560] [SPEAKER_00]：那周输了比赛，这个词很容易被拿出来，就像服用鸦片一样。确实如此。
[00:02:37.480] [SPEAKER_02]: and if anyone's ever trying to rationalize something or explain themselves, you can just slap
[00:02:37.480] [SPEAKER_02]：如果有人试图为某件事辩解或解释自己，你只需一巴掌就行了。
[00:02:43.820] [SPEAKER_02]: on copium. You're coping. No need to explain further and it always guarantees laughs.
[00:02:43.820] [SPEAKER_02]：你在服用安眠药。你在缓解症状。无需进一步解释，而且这总能让人发笑。
[00:02:50.520] [SPEAKER_02]: A pretty good application of this is I watch like the pro valiant attorneys. There's this one
[00:02:50.520] [SPEAKER_02]：这方面的一个很好的应用是，我喜欢看那些英勇的律师。比如这个。
[00:02:56.820] [SPEAKER_02]: team that's like super super popular called Sentinels and then oftentimes they kind of, you know,
[00:02:56.820] [SPEAKER_02]：有个叫哨兵队的队伍，超级超级受欢迎，而且他们经常会……你知道的，
[00:03:03.360] [SPEAKER_02]: maybe lose out early or something of that sort and then people are always like okay in order
[00:03:03.360] [SPEAKER_02]：也许一开始就输了，或者诸如此类的事情，然后人们总是会说，好吧，为了……
[00:03:08.700] [SPEAKER_02]: for Sentinels to make it to play offs or regionals or whatever, they have to like win these next
[00:03:08.700] [SPEAKER_02]：哨兵队要想晋级季后赛、地区赛或其他什么比赛，就必须赢下接下来的几场比赛。
[00:03:15.420] [SPEAKER_02]: games by X amount of rounds. These other teams need to lose by like this amount of rounds.
[00:03:15.420] [SPEAKER_02]：比赛需要输掉X轮。其他球队也需要输掉这么多轮。
[00:03:21.300] [SPEAKER_02]: Everything needs to fall into line and then everyone's always like do major copium.
[00:03:21.300] [SPEAKER_02]：所有事情都需要按部就班，然后大家总是会像吸食大量可卡因一样。
[00:03:27.540] [SPEAKER_00]: My family that's like copium almost. Oh true true. Or the funny ones too are like when
[00:03:27.540] [SPEAKER_00]：我家那帮人简直跟嗑药似的。哦，对对。或者说，那些搞笑的也像……
[00:03:34.580] [SPEAKER_00]: someone loses and they're like you know what I didn't even want to win this anyway. Like if I
[00:03:34.580] [SPEAKER_00]：有人输了，然后他们会说，你知道吗，反正我本来就不想赢。就像如果我
[00:03:38.920] [SPEAKER_00]: won this I would have had to do this or like we totally would have won this if LeBron wasn't out
[00:03:38.920] [SPEAKER_00]：如果勒布朗没缺席，我肯定能赢下这场比赛，否则我就不得不这么做了。
[00:03:44.020] [SPEAKER_00]: sick this day or something and everyone's just like dude that's hard copium. You have to go a
[00:03:44.020] [SPEAKER_00]：今天生病了什么的，大家都说，兄弟，这药太难吃了。你得去……
[00:03:49.000] [SPEAKER_02]: grade copium. Once you understand copium it's just so easy to like utilize it in your day today.
[00:03:49.000] [SPEAKER_02]：这是克洛普。一旦你了解了克洛普，你就会发现它在日常生活中非常容易使用。
[00:03:57.120] [SPEAKER_00]: There is. And always envision the pepe. Hopping. Hopping copium. It's so funny.
[00:03:57.120] [SPEAKER_00]：确实有。而且要一直想象佩佩蛙。跳来跳去。跳来跳去的科皮姆。太搞笑了。
[00:04:05.080] [SPEAKER_02]: Well one way that I personally use copium a lot is when I go through my life crises.
[00:04:05.080] [SPEAKER_02]：我个人经常使用安眠药的一种情况是，当我经历人生危机时。
[00:04:12.800] [SPEAKER_00]: Well let's get into it. What has been your latest crisis? Dude I feel like I say this every time
[00:04:12.800] [SPEAKER_00]：好吧，咱们进入正题。你最近遇到的危机是什么？老兄，感觉我每次都这么说。
[00:04:18.780] [SPEAKER_02]: but my crisis is always what do I do with my life? Okay I think it's because we're around that time you know
[00:04:18.780] [SPEAKER_02]：但我的危机总是“我的人生该何去何从？”好吧，我想这是因为我们正处于那个阶段，你知道的。
[00:04:28.170] [SPEAKER_02]: quarter life crises. We're like figuring out the next steps in our lives. Big transitions and changes
[00:04:28.170] [SPEAKER_02]：四分之一人生危机。我们就像在思考人生的下一步该怎么走。重大的转变和变化。
[00:04:35.750] [SPEAKER_02]: are upon us. lately things that I've been thinking about a lot is big decisions in life. Like
[00:04:35.750] [SPEAKER_02]：即将到来。最近我一直在思考的是人生中的重大决定。比如
[00:04:43.170] [SPEAKER_02]: marriage, having kids, freezing your eggs, all of these kinds of things. It's especially relevant now
[00:04:43.170] [SPEAKER_02]：结婚、生孩子、冷冻卵子，所有这些事情。现在尤其如此。
[00:04:49.510] [SPEAKER_02]: because we as women are hitting the age where you really start to consider like oh my god I am
[00:04:49.510] [SPEAKER_02]：因为我们女性到了某个年纪，开始认真思考，比如，天哪，我
[00:04:55.390] [SPEAKER_02]: almost 30 what does this mean for my health and ability for having children and yeah it's so
[00:04:55.390] [SPEAKER_02]：快30岁了，这对我的健康和生育能力意味着什么？唉，真是……
[00:05:02.250] [SPEAKER_02]: fucked up because I think what after 34 or something you're literally labeled as geriatric pregnancy
[00:05:02.250] [SPEAKER_02]：真糟糕，因为我觉得过了34岁左右，你就会被贴上“高龄妊娠”的标签。
[00:05:08.750] [SPEAKER_02]: if you get pregnant. I feel like the undeniable biological clock is kind of catching up to us.
[00:05:08.750] [SPEAKER_02]：如果你怀孕了。我觉得不可否认的生物钟正在追赶我们。
[00:05:17.110] [SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a lot to think about. I'm like whoa how do you know if you want to have kids?
[00:05:17.110] [SPEAKER_02]：这真的有很多事情需要考虑。我就想，哇，你怎么知道自己想不想生孩子呢？
[00:05:21.970] [SPEAKER_02]: How do you know if you're ready for marriage or if you're ready for you know huge responsibilities
[00:05:21.970] [SPEAKER_02]：你怎么知道自己是否准备好结婚，或者是否准备好承担重大的责任？
[00:05:29.330] [SPEAKER_02]: that other people are involved in? And I think it's like sometimes especially,
[00:05:29.330] [SPEAKER_02]：其他人也参与其中？而且我觉得有时候尤其如此，
[00:05:36.470] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I guess like confusing or jarring for me because I'm very used to being
[00:05:36.470] [SPEAKER_02]：我不知道，我猜这对我来说有点令人困惑或不适，因为我已经非常习惯于……
[00:05:42.950] [SPEAKER_02]: very confident in my choices. I'm usually very like oh yeah 100% I will do this like right
[00:05:42.950] [SPEAKER_02]：我对自己的选择非常有信心。我通常会想，哦耶，我百分之百会这么做，对吧？
[00:05:50.350] [SPEAKER_02]: but then now these like huge decisions I'm like oh my god I don't know and this is like one of
[00:05:50.350] [SPEAKER_02]：但是现在这些就像重大决定一样，我就想，我的天哪，我不知道，这就像其中之一……
[00:05:55.570] [SPEAKER_02]: the few times where I truly don't know and it's such a big impactful decision.
[00:05:55.570] [SPEAKER_02]：少数几次我真的不知道该怎么办，而且这是一个影响非常大的重大决定。
[00:06:01.890] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's also just so much pressure because I don't know in some ways I feel like men
[00:06:01.890] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得压力真的很大，因为我不知道，在某些方面，我觉得自己像个男人
[00:06:07.670] [SPEAKER_00]: are almost allowed to age and like embrace each year for what it is but as women there's so
[00:06:07.670] [SPEAKER_00]：几乎所有人都被允许自然衰老，欣然接受每一年的更迭，但作为女性，却有太多这样的限制。
[00:06:14.990] [SPEAKER_00]: emphasis placed on like our youth and the younger you are like you know people cat call you more
[00:06:14.990] [SPEAKER_00]：重点在于像我们年轻时那样，你越年轻，就越容易被人吹口哨。
[00:06:20.690] [SPEAKER_00]: and everyone's like oh my god there's this deadline of being 30 like are you gonna get married
[00:06:20.690] [SPEAKER_00]：然后大家都会说，我的天哪，30岁是个结婚的最后期限，你到底要不要结婚啊？
[00:06:25.430] [SPEAKER_00]: or you're gonna do this for all of the all before that so then I feel like age is almost
[00:06:25.430] [SPEAKER_00]：或者你要为之前的所有事情都这样做，这样我觉得年龄几乎就……
[00:06:30.770] [SPEAKER_00]: inflicted on us or like this pace of time is inflicted on us whereas men are just like oh another year
[00:06:30.770] [SPEAKER_00]：这种时间流逝的速度强加于我们，而男人们却只是觉得，哦，又一年过去了。
[00:06:36.490] [SPEAKER_02]: like another birthday yeah that's so good true and I feel like it's always about how the
[00:06:36.490] [SPEAKER_02]：就像又过了一个生日，是啊，那太好了，确实如此，我觉得一切都和如何……
[00:06:45.610] [SPEAKER_02]: women's body is being affected with age you know for example like the eggs in our ovaries are
[00:06:45.610] [SPEAKER_02]：女性的身体会随着年龄增长而受到影响，比如我们卵巢中的卵子……
[00:06:52.750] [SPEAKER_02]: less prime i guess so when we get older but how come there's no talk about like sperm dying
[00:06:52.750] [SPEAKER_02]：我想随着年龄增长，精子数量会减少，但为什么没人讨论精子死亡之类的问题呢？
[00:07:01.750] [SPEAKER_00]: dude it's cuz that sperm is like perpetual motion like it just keeps getting great
[00:07:01.750] [SPEAKER_00]：兄弟，那是因为精子就像永动机一样，一直在变得更棒。
[00:07:07.870] [SPEAKER_02]: oh shit you're right you're right that's constant production but like our eggs are just
[00:07:07.870] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，天哪，你说得对，你说得对，那是持续生产，但是我们的鸡蛋只是
[00:07:13.870] [SPEAKER_02]: the total amount eggs we have exist when we're born right yeah i think something like that
[00:07:13.870] [SPEAKER_02]：我们出生时体内卵子的总数，对吧？嗯，我想应该是这样。
[00:07:20.110] [SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know it's like not even just about the reproductive system i feel like I was pretty young
[00:07:20.110] [SPEAKER_00]：但我不知道，这感觉不仅仅是生殖系统的问题，我觉得我当时还很年轻。
[00:07:25.590] [SPEAKER_00]: when i started thinking about anti-aging stuff and i don't know it's like we're not even 30 yet
[00:07:25.590] [SPEAKER_00]：当我开始思考抗衰老的事情时，我不知道，感觉我们甚至还没到30岁呢。
[00:07:32.950] [SPEAKER_00]: not that 30 is some magic number but I feel like we're still fairly young and i'm always like
[00:07:32.950] [SPEAKER_00]：倒不是说30岁是什么神奇的数字，但我感觉我们还很年轻，我总是觉得……
[00:07:37.950] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god like i need to put on sunscreen and do this and that to like prevent aging
[00:07:37.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，我需要涂防晒霜，还要做这做那，才能防止衰老。
[00:07:42.290] [SPEAKER_00]: whereas i don't think that takes up even like 1% of my husband's brain you know like there's no
[00:07:42.290] [SPEAKER_00]：而我觉得这甚至连我丈夫大脑的1%都不到，你知道吗，就像根本没有一样。
[00:07:48.630] [SPEAKER_02]: ways to give out as much as like i do it's like those memes where it's like my boyfriend slash
[00:07:48.630] [SPEAKER_02]：像我这样付出很多的方式，就像那些梗图一样，比如“我的男朋友”
[00:07:54.170] [SPEAKER_02]: husband just like splashes water on his face and his skin is so clear i'm like meanwhile
[00:07:54.170] [SPEAKER_02]：我老公只是往脸上泼了点水，皮肤就那么好光滑，我心想与此同时
[00:07:59.890] [SPEAKER_02]: the girls are like baskets and like shelves of skincare and they're like why am i still breaking
[00:07:59.890] [SPEAKER_02]：这些女孩就像篮子和架子一样，里面装满了护肤品，她们会想，为什么我还在破损
[00:08:06.610] [SPEAKER_00]: out? I know it's like my 40 minute nighttime routine versus like the 6 and 1 shampoo cleanser
[00:08:06.610] [SPEAKER_00]：出去了吗？我知道这就像我40分钟的夜间护肤流程和6合1洗发洁面乳之间的区别。
[00:08:14.010] [SPEAKER_02]: funny but about that i saw a funny thing recently i never looked into this to determine how true
[00:08:14.010] [SPEAKER_02]：说来好笑，不过我最近看到一件挺有意思的事，但我从来没仔细研究过，不知道是不是真的。
[00:08:22.780] [SPEAKER_02]: this is but i saw something that was like women need more sleep than men because they use their
[00:08:22.780] [SPEAKER_02]：我看到过一些说法，好像是说女性比男性需要更多睡眠，因为她们会用……
[00:08:29.120] [SPEAKER_02]: brains more and i was like down that's probably the root of all our problems like me just
[00:08:29.120] [SPEAKER_02]：脑子更灵光，我当时就想，这可能是我们所有问题的根源，就像我一样。
[00:08:37.450] [SPEAKER_02]: to stop using our brains i wish you could pause it i'm not kind of stand up to me as you talk
[00:08:37.450] [SPEAKER_02]：停止使用我们的大脑，我希望你能暂停一下，我不是那种在你说话时反驳我的人。
[00:08:44.590] [SPEAKER_00]: through this crisis is you said you usually feel very confident in your decisions and i feel like
[00:08:44.590] [SPEAKER_00]：在这次危机中，您说您通常对自己的决定非常有信心，我觉得
[00:08:50.170] [SPEAKER_00]: i have also seen that as your friend but now you're kind of feeling unsure about it
[00:08:50.170] [SPEAKER_00]：我也曾把那视为你的朋友，但现在你似乎有点不确定了。
[00:08:55.410] [SPEAKER_02]: what do you think that stems from dude i don't know i think part of it might be that
[00:08:55.410] [SPEAKER_02]：你觉得这源于什么？我不知道，我觉得部分原因可能是……
[00:09:03.430] [SPEAKER_02]: these decisions involve other people like in a much bigger degree than my normal decisions
[00:09:03.430] [SPEAKER_02]：这些决定比我通常的决定更多地涉及到其他人。
[00:09:10.030] [SPEAKER_02]: you know normal data data decisions are pretty focused on yourself and probably don't have too
[00:09:10.030] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，通常情况下，数据决策都比较关注自身，可能不太需要……
[00:09:15.870] [SPEAKER_02]: much of a lasting impact on the people around you it's not like you're making decisions
[00:09:15.870] [SPEAKER_02]：对你周围的人产生持久影响，这不像是在做决定。
[00:09:22.030] [SPEAKER_02]: that will bring someone along for the rest of your life which is pretty much what marriages right
[00:09:22.030] [SPEAKER_02]：那会让你余生都和另一个人在一起，这不就是婚姻的本质吗？
[00:09:27.690] [SPEAKER_02]: that's true and having kids i will literally bring a living being into this world and
[00:09:27.690] [SPEAKER_02]：没错，有了孩子，我就会真正地把一个生命带到这个世界上。
[00:09:34.510] [SPEAKER_02]: basically have responsibility over them for the rest of my life and then marriages you know kind of
[00:09:34.510] [SPEAKER_02]：基本上，我余生都要对他们负责，然后就是婚姻，你知道的，有点像……
[00:09:45.490] [SPEAKER_02]: the rest of our lives and just it's like a 50-50 decision in terms of responsibility i'm like whoa
[00:09:45.490] [SPEAKER_02]：我们余生的命运，这就像是一个责任五五开的决定，我当时就想，哇哦。
[00:09:53.370] [SPEAKER_00]: that's crazy do you think it feels crazy in a foreign way but still exciting or crazy and
[00:09:53.370] [SPEAKER_00]：这太疯狂了，你觉得这种疯狂是异国情调的疯狂，但仍然令人兴奋或疯狂吗？
[00:10:01.710] [SPEAKER_00]: like a i am just frozen because i don't know or to do kind of way i think it's like a bit of
[00:10:01.710] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我愣住了，因为我不知道该怎么做，我觉得有点像……
[00:10:08.830] [SPEAKER_02]: frozenness i think i have a personal opinion a little bit on these decisions but then there's always
[00:10:08.830] [SPEAKER_02]：关于冻结，我觉得我对这些决定有一些个人看法，但总会有其他因素。
[00:10:14.430] [SPEAKER_02]: the fear of like oh what if this becomes something i regret or something that not just i regret but
[00:10:14.430] [SPEAKER_02]：害怕的是，如果这件事让我后悔怎么办，或者不仅仅是让我后悔，
[00:10:21.890] [SPEAKER_02]: like other people also regret or are negatively affected by i don't know maybe it's also just
[00:10:21.890] [SPEAKER_02]：就像其他人一样，我也会后悔或者受到负面影响，我不知道，也许只是……
[00:10:29.230] [SPEAKER_00]: because as we get older the gravity of these decisions also get bigger it's like when you're younger
[00:10:29.230] [SPEAKER_00]：因为随着年龄增长，这些决定的重要性也越来越大，就像年轻的时候一样。
[00:10:36.290] [SPEAKER_00]: your single or maybe you might be in a relationship but like you want to move somewhere there's
[00:10:36.290] [SPEAKER_00]：你是单身，或者你可能正在恋爱中，但你想搬到某个地方。
[00:10:41.030] [SPEAKER_00]: a reversibility in that but like you said there's like so much permanence and like wait and like
[00:10:41.030] [SPEAKER_00]：这其中存在可逆性，但就像你说的，也有很多永久性，等等，就像
[00:10:47.010] [SPEAKER_00]: i don't know seriousness associated with bigger life decisions that happen around this age
[00:10:47.010] [SPEAKER_00]：我不了解这个年龄段人们面对重大人生抉择时的严肃性。
[00:10:51.850] [SPEAKER_00]: so i can see why it could be freezing for sick and a lot of the right word but you don't
[00:10:51.850] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我能理解为什么生病时会卡顿，而且很多词都用对了，但你却不明白。
[00:10:57.590] [SPEAKER_02]: I mean thank you for us yeah because also i think say for example like marriage and kids you can
[00:10:57.590] [SPEAKER_02]：我的意思是，谢谢你们，因为我觉得，比如说婚姻和孩子，你们可以
[00:11:05.130] [SPEAKER_02]: make a decision that is easily reversible but those are the decisions of doing nothing like you
[00:11:05.130] [SPEAKER_02]：做出一个容易撤销的决定，但这种决定就像你一样，就是什么都不做。
[00:11:12.030] [SPEAKER_02]: know not getting married not having kids those are easily reversible sides of this decision
[00:11:12.030] [SPEAKER_02]：我知道不结婚、不生孩子这些都是这个决定很容易逆转的方面。
[00:11:17.730] [SPEAKER_02]: but the other side is like much less reversible if true you're married then you would have to go
[00:11:17.730] [SPEAKER_02]：但另一方面，如果属实，可逆性就小得多。如果你已婚，那么你就必须离开。
[00:11:23.750] [SPEAKER_02]: through a whole divorce process and all of that and if you have kids like you can't really
[00:11:23.750] [SPEAKER_02]：经历整个离婚程序等等，如果你有孩子，你就真的没办法了。
[00:11:29.210] [SPEAKER_00]: reverse that yeah and i think it directly contradicts what we were talking about earlier
[00:11:29.210] [SPEAKER_00]：反过来说，是的，我认为这直接与我们之前讨论的内容相矛盾。
[00:11:34.790] [SPEAKER_00]: of like oh there's all this emphasis on like you have to do things quickly like do things before
[00:11:34.790] [SPEAKER_00]：就像，哦，这里强调的是，你必须快速做事，比如在……之前做事。
[00:11:39.390] [SPEAKER_00]: certain time well what if i want to take my time and noodle on these things before
[00:11:39.390] [SPEAKER_00]：如果我想慢慢来，仔细考虑一下这些问题呢？
[00:11:44.630] [SPEAKER_00]: impossibly choosing like yes or no and then just being stuck with it for like all eternity
[00:11:44.630] [SPEAKER_00]：做出“是”或“否”这种不可能的选择，然后就永远被困在这个结果里。
[00:11:51.150] [SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's pretty wavy and i'm like dude we're just like we're just like children how can we
[00:11:51.150] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，这感觉很复杂，我就想，老兄，我们就像孩子一样，我们怎么能这样呢？
[00:11:57.310] [SPEAKER_00]: be making these decisions? yeah and i think the hardest thing too is the involvement of
[00:11:57.310] [SPEAKER_00]：做这些决定？是的，而且我认为最难的也是……的参与
[00:12:03.390] [SPEAKER_00]: other people like you said mm-hmm everyone has timelines and it's not even always just like
[00:12:03.390] [SPEAKER_00]：就像你说的，嗯，每个人都有自己的时间表，而且事情并不总是像……
[00:12:08.690] [SPEAKER_00]: you and your partners like your family your friends people around you they all have timelines
[00:12:08.690] [SPEAKER_00]：你和你的伴侣，就像你的家人、朋友以及你身边的人一样，他们都有自己的时间安排。
[00:12:14.250] [SPEAKER_00]: and i feel like between you and your partner coordinating that is already kind of difficult not
[00:12:14.250] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得你和你的伴侣之间协调就已经很困难了，不是吗？
[00:12:19.410] [SPEAKER_00]: difficult but it's not like the easiest conversation in the world but then adding in everyone else
[00:12:19.410] [SPEAKER_00]：这很难，虽然不是世界上最容易的对话，但再加上其他人的参与就更难了。
[00:12:24.390] [SPEAKER_02]: is what truly makes it torture sometimes dude and i think another aspect of these decisions for
[00:12:24.390] [SPEAKER_02]：有时候这才是真正让人痛苦的地方，伙计，而且我认为这些决定还有另一个方面……
[00:12:32.950] [SPEAKER_02]: personally i think about it and like is this what i want? is this the life i want to work towards
[00:12:32.950] [SPEAKER_02]：我个人会思考这个问题，我会想，这是我想要的吗？这是我想要努力追求的生活吗？
[00:12:42.110] [SPEAKER_02]: i think it would be easier if i knew for sure personally like oh i really want to have kids
[00:12:42.110] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得如果我能确定自己真的想要孩子，那就容易多了。
[00:12:47.650] [SPEAKER_02]: or that kind of stuff but i think right now my personal opinion is do i want to have kids like maybe
[00:12:47.650] [SPEAKER_02]：或者类似的事情，但我觉得现在我个人的想法是，我是否想要孩子，比如……
[00:12:53.830] [SPEAKER_02]: not i don't know that like unsureness also just seeps into the rest of the whole like decision
[00:12:53.830] [SPEAKER_02]：不，我不知道，就像不确定感也会渗透到整个决策的其他部分。
[00:13:02.270] [SPEAKER_02]: and of course it's like i wouldn't want someone else to make the decision for me in the sense
[00:13:02.270] [SPEAKER_02]：当然，我也不希望别人替我做决定。
[00:13:07.730] [SPEAKER_02]: where it's like your partner wants to have kids and then you're like i don't know and then you're
[00:13:07.730] [SPEAKER_02]：就像你的伴侣想要孩子，然后你却说我不知道，然后你就……
[00:13:12.610] [SPEAKER_02]: like well since i'm unsure we'll just do it then like it doesn't really feel right i guess
[00:13:12.610] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，既然我不确定，那我们就先这么做吧，感觉不太对劲。
[00:13:18.110] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah that's true i think it's also just hearted in vision me right now as a 28 year old i have
[00:13:18.110] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，没错，我觉得这对我来说也是一种切身感受。我现在28岁，我有
[00:13:24.910] [SPEAKER_00]: things that i want and don't want right but as a 40 year old am i gonna want or not want the same
[00:13:24.910] [SPEAKER_00]：我想要和不想要的东西，对吧？但是作为一个40岁的人，我还会想要同样的东西吗？
[00:13:31.050] [SPEAKER_00]: things like what about when i'm 50 60 et cetera so i always like think about that too i'm
[00:13:31.050] [SPEAKER_00]：比如当我50岁、60岁等等的时候会怎么样，所以我总是喜欢思考这些问题。
[00:13:36.770] [SPEAKER_00]: like who am i gonna be 20 years from now 30 years from now like what is my life gonna be in my
[00:13:36.770] [SPEAKER_00]：比如，20年后，30年后，我会变成什么样？我的人生会是什么样子？
[00:13:41.370] [SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle too yeah so i think i'm just in a big like what is my next step you know like what
[00:13:41.370] [SPEAKER_02]：生活方式也是，所以我觉得我现在很迷茫，不知道下一步该怎么走，你知道，就像……
[00:13:47.970] [SPEAKER_02]: is 30 year old crystal want and like what do i need to do to reach that in the next couple years
[00:13:47.970] [SPEAKER_02]：我30岁了，想要水晶，想做什么才能在未来几年达到那个目标？
[00:13:54.950] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god five year plan oh no no couple years
[00:13:54.950] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天啊，五年计划，哦不，不，几年
[00:14:03.590] [SPEAKER_02]: i can i i would never be able to plan so far but i thought it was also funny that i'm
[00:14:03.590] [SPEAKER_02]：我可以，我永远不可能计划这么远，但我认为这也很有趣，因为我
[00:14:11.310] [SPEAKER_02]: having this crisis because in my mind i'm like dude i feel like i'm having a midlife crisis and
[00:14:11.310] [SPEAKER_02]：之所以会遇到这场危机，是因为我觉得自己好像正经历中年危机。
[00:14:16.730] [SPEAKER_02]: whenever i tell people that they're like um i don't think you're quite there yet like i'm in
[00:14:16.730] [SPEAKER_02]：每当我跟别人说起这件事，他们就会说，嗯，我觉得你还没完全做到，就像我一样。
[00:14:24.370] [SPEAKER_02]: doing things that people with midlife crisis do i think about making big purchases so that i have
[00:14:24.370] [SPEAKER_02]：做一些中年危机患者会做的事情，比如考虑大手笔购物，这样我就可以……
[00:14:31.610] [SPEAKER_02]: control over my life i literally was like looking at new cars when i have like no reason to buy
[00:14:31.610] [SPEAKER_02]：我掌控着自己的生活，我简直就像在看新车一样，明明我根本没有理由买。
[00:14:37.830] [SPEAKER_02]: a new car and i was like oh my god like what would be a fun car to own like oh my god like a convertible
[00:14:37.830] [SPEAKER_02]：一辆新车，我当时就想，我的天哪，什么样的车开起来才好玩呢？我的天哪，敞篷车！
[00:14:44.090] [SPEAKER_02]: car all of that kind of stuff and i was like wait i literally sound like a middle-aged man
[00:14:44.090] [SPEAKER_02]：汽车之类的东西，然后我就想，等等，我听起来简直像个中年男人
[00:14:50.160] [SPEAKER_02]: trying to like find the fun in life again or something maybe it's like the ghost of your
[00:14:50.160] [SPEAKER_02]：试着重新找回生活的乐趣，或者说，也许就像你的幽灵一样。
[00:14:56.100] [SPEAKER_00]: middle-aged self trying to come out maybe you should do like a say on so try to talk to it
[00:14:56.100] [SPEAKER_00]：中年自我试图出柜，也许你应该发表一下意见，试着和它谈谈。
[00:15:01.300] [SPEAKER_02]: i feel like what do you want right but i do think on the other side of that there are some
[00:15:01.300] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得你想要的是什么？但另一方面，我也觉得有一些问题。
[00:15:07.900] [SPEAKER_02]: positive changes that i've been making i'm like oh my god like you know age is real i need to
[00:15:07.900] [SPEAKER_02]：我一直在做出一些积极的改变，我简直不敢相信，你知道，年龄是真实存在的，我需要……
[00:15:13.300] [SPEAKER_02]: healthier make hopefully small adjustments that eventually lead to bigger positive consequence
[00:15:13.300] [SPEAKER_02]：更健康的做法是做出一些小的调整，希望这些调整最终能带来更大的积极影响。
[00:15:22.060] [SPEAKER_00]: it really is the perfect time to do it i almost feel like you know people are always like oh there's
[00:15:22.060] [SPEAKER_00]：现在真的是做这件事的最佳时机，我感觉人们总是会说，哦，还有……
[00:15:27.060] [SPEAKER_00]: like shoulder seasons for travel so like a lot of people travel during summers or maybe you
[00:15:27.060] [SPEAKER_00]：就像旅游淡季一样，很多人会在夏天旅行，或者也许你会……
[00:15:32.380] [SPEAKER_00]: want to travel during the shoulder season that might be like in between winter and spring or something
[00:15:32.380] [SPEAKER_00]：想在淡季旅行，比如冬天和春天之间的那个时候之类的。
[00:15:36.640] [SPEAKER_00]: i feel like this age of 28 is like a shoulder season of life due where we're not quite in our
[00:15:36.640] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得28岁就像人生的一个过渡阶段，因为我们还没有完全进入人生的某个阶段。
[00:15:43.140] [SPEAKER_00]: 30s but i'm just anticipating it so much that i might as well be fun 30 already i feel like oh
[00:15:43.140] [SPEAKER_00]：还有30秒，但我太期待了，感觉自己好像已经30岁了，真开心啊。
[00:15:49.780] [SPEAKER_02]: well i see a lot of people enter their 30s and then they they show much more confidence and like
[00:15:49.780] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，我看到很多人到了30岁之后，就表现出更强的自信，而且……
[00:15:55.860] [SPEAKER_02]: contentment with what where they are i worry i'm like oh my god is this like true satisfaction
[00:15:55.860] [SPEAKER_02]：我对他们现在所处的环境感到满足，但我担心，我会想，天哪，这真的是真正的满足吗？
[00:16:02.460] [SPEAKER_02]: or did they just give up on life and was like well this is the best we're gonna get oh my god
[00:16:02.460] [SPEAKER_02]：还是他们干脆放弃了生活，心想“好吧，这就是我们能得到的最好结果了”，我的天哪
[00:16:08.780] [SPEAKER_00]: i feel like do you i feel like 30s will be a slay i think the life that will live in our 30s
[00:16:08.780] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得，你觉得呢？我觉得30岁会很精彩，我觉得30岁的生活会很棒。
[00:16:14.720] [SPEAKER_00]: will be so fun but my problem is like how do we get there because there's like a gap right now
[00:16:14.720] [SPEAKER_00]：那肯定很有趣，但我的问题是，我们该怎么到达那里？因为现在好像有个缺口。
[00:16:21.260] [SPEAKER_02]: we're like how do we fast forward the next two years but yeah that's you know that's been my
[00:16:21.260] [SPEAKER_02]：我们当时就在想，怎么才能快进到接下来的两年呢？嗯，你知道，这就是我一直以来的想法。
[00:16:27.260] [SPEAKER_02]: crisis just another facet of what do i do with my life and what do you know what is this age
[00:16:27.260] [SPEAKER_02]：危机不过是我人生该何去何从的另一个方面，你知道吗，这究竟是怎样的年纪？
[00:16:34.740] [SPEAKER_02]: and what are these decisions how about you what have you been thinking about so for me i have
[00:16:34.740] [SPEAKER_02]：这些决定是什么？你呢？你在想什么？就我而言，我有……
[00:16:42.340] [SPEAKER_00]: recently started a new job yeah and i am a couple weeks into it and it's been amazing i've been
[00:16:42.340] [SPEAKER_00]：最近开始了一份新工作，是的，我已经工作了几个星期了，感觉棒极了，我一直……
[00:16:50.260] [SPEAKER_00]: loving the onboarding process the team the people the company everything but here's a problem
[00:16:50.260] [SPEAKER_00]：我很喜欢入职流程、团队、员工、公司的一切，但是有个问题
[00:16:57.540] [SPEAKER_00]: before this i had stayed at the same company for a long time i have also moved back to my
[00:16:57.540] [SPEAKER_00]：在此之前，我曾长期在同一家公司工作，现在我也搬回了我的家。
[00:17:05.200] [SPEAKER_00]: hometown post college so a lot of our college friends and high school friends are here and i feel
[00:17:05.200] [SPEAKER_00]：大学毕业后回到家乡，所以很多大学朋友和高中朋友都在这里，我觉得
[00:17:11.540] [SPEAKER_00]: like just in general i haven't had to make new friends in like a completely new environment in a very
[00:17:11.540] [SPEAKER_00]：总的来说，我还没有在一个全新的环境中结交过新朋友，这很不寻常。
[00:17:17.580] [SPEAKER_00]: long time so i just don't i forgot how to make new friends and i feel like i'm like a funny
[00:17:17.580] [SPEAKER_00]：好久不见，我都忘了怎么交新朋友了，感觉自己像个傻瓜。
[00:17:24.020] [SPEAKER_00]: person like i feel like i have positive strength that i could bring yes to like a social situation
[00:17:24.020] [SPEAKER_00]：像我这样的人，感觉自己拥有积极的力量，可以带到社交场合。
[00:17:29.780] [SPEAKER_00]: but i it's hard for me to get there for some reason and i was like doing some
[00:17:29.780] [SPEAKER_00]：但不知为何我很难到达那里，我当时就像在做一些……
[00:17:37.520] [SPEAKER_00]: analysis on like my social situation at work right now and i was like you know i feel like
[00:17:37.520] [SPEAKER_00]：分析一下我现在在工作中的社交状况，然后我就想，你知道，我感觉……
[00:17:41.900] [SPEAKER_00]: my people talk to me i have stuff to say and i feel like it's kind of interesting or like funny
[00:17:41.900] [SPEAKER_00]：我的家人跟我说话，我有很多话想说，我觉得挺有意思的，或者说挺搞笑的。
[00:17:46.620] [SPEAKER_00]: but it's like really hard for me to must up the courage to like start a new conversation with someone
[00:17:46.620] [SPEAKER_00]：但是对我来说，鼓起勇气和别人开始一段新的对话真的很难。
[00:17:52.840] [SPEAKER_00]: and i was like that's a problem because you can't always rely on other people to like start the conversation
[00:17:52.840] [SPEAKER_00]：我就想，这确实是个问题，因为你不能总是指望别人来开启对话。
[00:17:58.300] [SPEAKER_00]: but it just gives me a lot of anxiety to open my mouth and have words to build a bit
[00:17:58.300] [SPEAKER_00]：但是，开口说话，组织语言，这让我很焦虑。
[00:18:05.280] [SPEAKER_02]: unpromptured yeah so that's been what i'm going through that makes total sense and i think also
[00:18:05.280] [SPEAKER_02]：是的，我就是这么过来的，这完全说得通，而且我觉得也
[00:18:10.460] [SPEAKER_02]: sometimes it's hard in the beginning because you don't know everyone's sense of humor yet so you're
[00:18:10.460] [SPEAKER_02]：有时候一开始会比较难，因为你还不了解每个人的幽默感，所以你
[00:18:16.460] [SPEAKER_02]: oh are they gonna laugh or is it like inappropriate for work or all of that stuff but
[00:18:16.460] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，他们会笑吗？还是说这在工作场合不合适之类的？
[00:18:23.620] [SPEAKER_02]: jesus boy do i have a podcast for you beat your crust episode 188 making coworker friends
[00:18:23.620] [SPEAKER_02]：老天爷啊，我这儿有个播客节目要推荐给你，《Beat Your Crust》第188集：如何与同事交朋友
[00:18:32.700] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god honestly so true i listen to that we made that episode for future you
[00:18:32.700] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，说得太对了，我听了，我们做这期节目是为了未来的你。
[00:18:40.570] [SPEAKER_00]: haha it's not as bad as i'm making it out to be like it's not like i'm eating lunch and a corner
[00:18:40.570] [SPEAKER_00]: 哈哈，没我说的那么糟，我又不是在角落里吃午饭。
[00:18:46.270] [SPEAKER_00]: crying every day i still eat with everyone and it's fine it's just i don't feel seen right now
[00:18:46.270] [SPEAKER_00]：我每天都在哭，但我还是和大家一起吃饭，一切都很好，只是我现在感觉自己不被重视。
[00:18:54.230] [SPEAKER_00]: and it once you are friends with people it's like they know who you are so if i say some sort of
[00:18:54.230] [SPEAKER_00]：一旦你和别人成了朋友，就好像他们认识你一样，所以如果我说一些……
[00:18:59.290] [SPEAKER_00]: joke they're like oh that's such a g-soo thing to like i want to get to that level and right now i
[00:18:59.290] [SPEAKER_00]：开玩笑说，哦，那真是太酷了，我也想达到那个水平，而现在我
[00:19:09.410] [SPEAKER_00]: wish to my identity and the word place yet but you know i'm also very green it's literally been like a
[00:19:09.410] [SPEAKER_00]：希望我的身份和词语的归属感还没有定型，但你知道，我也很稚嫩，这简直就像……
[00:19:14.650] [SPEAKER_02]: couple weeks so i'm getting there yeah and i'm sure it's like a huge contrast because
[00:19:14.650] [SPEAKER_02]：大概几周时间，我快到了，是的，我确信这会形成巨大的反差，因为
[00:19:20.050] [SPEAKER_02]: you're literally coming from a place where people have known you for years to a brand new place where
[00:19:20.050] [SPEAKER_02]：你实际上是从一个人们认识你多年的地方，来到一个全新的地方，
[00:19:27.150] [SPEAKER_02]: you have to start over so it's kind of like oh it's not like before anymore yeah exactly i don't
[00:19:27.150] [SPEAKER_02]：你得重新开始，所以感觉就像，哦，一切都和以前不一样了，是啊，没错，我没有。
[00:19:33.890] [SPEAKER_00]: i guess i just forgot how vulnerable it feels to want to be the person to make friends
[00:19:33.890] [SPEAKER_00]：我想我只是忘了想要成为交朋友的人，那种感觉有多么脆弱。
[00:19:41.670] [SPEAKER_00]: because you know just the cold hard facts is like everyone at work has work friends already for the
[00:19:41.670] [SPEAKER_00]：因为你知道，残酷的现实是，每个人在工作中都已经有了工作上的朋友。
[00:19:47.830] [SPEAKER_00]: most part so then i'm the one going in and i'm like hey guys i'm also really a big friend
[00:19:47.830] [SPEAKER_00]：大部分时候都是这样，然后我就进去跟大家打招呼，说“嘿，伙计们，我也是你们的好朋友”。
[00:19:53.630] [SPEAKER_00]: but i have to be like fucking fessies with everyone you work with but you know i'm the one who
[00:19:53.630] [SPEAKER_00]：但我必须像个娘娘腔一样对待所有和你一起工作的人，但你知道，我才是那个……
[00:19:59.630] [SPEAKER_00]: has more to gain you know so i should be the one who's more vulnerable maybe putting myself out there
[00:19:59.630] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，我更有可能从中获利，所以我应该更脆弱一些，也许应该把自己暴露出来。
[00:20:06.230] [SPEAKER_00]: asking if people want to grab snacks or like you know anything as simple as that but i'm just
[00:20:06.230] [SPEAKER_00]：问问大家要不要吃点零食，或者你知道的，就这么简单的事，但我只是
[00:20:12.130] [SPEAKER_00]: slowly trying to ease into it and what's been helping me a little bit is the more i think about
[00:20:12.130] [SPEAKER_00]：我正在慢慢地尝试适应，对我帮助最大的一点是，我越思考……
[00:20:18.630] [SPEAKER_00]: it the worst it is if i'm like oh god like i should say something and like i should you know
[00:20:18.630] [SPEAKER_00]：最糟糕的情况就是，我会想，哦，天哪，我应该说点什么，你应该……你知道的。
[00:20:23.230] [SPEAKER_00]: ask them to get snack like i'm like i just won't do it but if i let my body move first like i just
[00:20:23.230] [SPEAKER_00]：让他们去拿零食，就好像我根本不会那样做，但如果我先让我的身体动起来，就像我刚刚那样
[00:20:29.090] [SPEAKER_00]: put my mouth and like how the words come out then i feel like it's better yeah
[00:20:29.090] [SPEAKER_00]：把嘴放上去，感觉话都说出来了，然后我就觉得这样更好了，是的。
[00:20:34.490] [SPEAKER_02]: has your team done any like bonding activity ever since you've joined?
[00:20:34.490] [SPEAKER_02]：自从你加入团队以来，你们团队有没有组织过任何类似的团队建设活动？
[00:20:40.110] [SPEAKER_02]: no they haven't well hopefully they do soon once or more settled in well i guess we did
[00:20:40.110] [SPEAKER_02]：不，他们还没有。希望他们很快就能安顿下来，或者至少我们已经安顿下来了。
[00:20:45.650] [SPEAKER_02]: we like why don't i walk or something but it's like happy hour that's not the same yeah like you
[00:20:45.650] [SPEAKER_02]：我们喜欢“Why Don't I Walk”之类的，但就像欢乐时光一样，那不一样，对，就像你一样。
[00:20:50.850] [SPEAKER_02]: need some happy hour or like a like a meal together that's like officially like team bonding you know
[00:20:50.850] [SPEAKER_02]：我们需要组织一次欢乐时光或者一起吃顿饭，正式地增进一下团队凝聚力，你知道的。
[00:20:58.570] [SPEAKER_00]: that is true actually the funny thing is the first week that i started coincidentally there was
[00:20:58.570] [SPEAKER_00]：确实如此。有趣的是，我入职的第一周碰巧就遇到了这种情况。
[00:21:05.610] [SPEAKER_00]: like a big event for the company so it was like summer outing or whatever and then we all went
[00:21:05.610] [SPEAKER_00]：就像公司的一次大型活动，就像夏季郊游之类的，然后我们都去了
[00:21:12.110] [SPEAKER_00]: to this venue and then spent five hours there just like playing games and like eating lunch
[00:21:12.110] [SPEAKER_00]：来到这个场地，然后在那里待了五个小时，就像玩游戏和吃午饭一样。
[00:21:17.350] [SPEAKER_00]: and drinking and stuff like that i was a little bit nervous about it because these things when
[00:21:17.350] [SPEAKER_00]：还有喝酒之类的，我有点紧张，因为这些事……
[00:21:22.510] [SPEAKER_00]: your brand new could either be like oh you meet hell of people and it's great or you don't know
[00:21:22.510] [SPEAKER_00]：你的全新体验可能就像是，你会遇到很多很棒的人，或者你根本不知道会发生什么。
[00:21:27.970] [SPEAKER_00]: anyone so you don't meet anyone and it's like super awkward but yeah i felt like you know my
[00:21:27.970] [SPEAKER_00]：所以你没遇到任何人，感觉超级尴尬，但是，是的，我觉得你知道我的
[00:21:33.430] [SPEAKER_00]: team members were introducing me to people which they also have been outside of the event
[00:21:33.430] [SPEAKER_00]：团队成员向我介绍了一些人，这些人他们在活动之外也认识。
[00:21:37.890] [SPEAKER_00]: and i was also you know being like a question ball like oh where do you live how you're
[00:21:37.890] [SPEAKER_00]：而且我当时就像个问号的人，比如，你住在哪里？你怎么样？
[00:21:41.650] [SPEAKER_00]: like okay like you know just like trying to engage in conversation and i was a little bit
[00:21:41.650] [SPEAKER_00]: 好吧，你知道，就是想找人聊聊天，我当时有点……
[00:21:46.850] [SPEAKER_00]: proud of myself nice me straight out of college i don't think i would have been able to handle this
[00:21:46.850] [SPEAKER_00]：我为自己感到骄傲，刚从大学毕业的我真不错，我觉得我当时根本应付不来。
[00:21:53.010] [SPEAKER_00]: but me now i have a little bit of social skills or something you're like where did these come from
[00:21:53.010] [SPEAKER_00]：但我现在有点社交技巧了，你可能会问，这些技巧是从哪儿来的？
[00:22:02.690] [SPEAKER_02]: like how am i talking right now that does some fun and i feel like that's nice that
[00:22:02.690] [SPEAKER_02]：就像我现在这样说话，感觉挺有意思的，我觉得挺好的。
[00:22:08.990] [SPEAKER_02]: it like coincidentally happened when you joined it's probably like a good warm up maybe
[00:22:08.990] [SPEAKER_02]：这就像你加入时碰巧发生的事，可能算是个不错的热身吧。
[00:22:13.910] [SPEAKER_00]: i think so and it did introduce me to like a couple people outside of my team so now i know
[00:22:13.910] [SPEAKER_00]：我也这么认为，而且它确实让我认识了团队以外的几个人，所以现在我知道了。
[00:22:20.570] [SPEAKER_00]: like i can say how do these people in the office and whatnot but yeah it just makes me feel
[00:22:20.570] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我可以说说办公室里这些人是怎么想的，等等，但总之，这让我感觉……
[00:22:24.790] [SPEAKER_00]: young again you know like i think i associate being vulnerable with feeling young as well so then
[00:22:24.790] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉又年轻了，你知道吗？我觉得脆弱和年轻也有联系，所以……
[00:22:31.170] [SPEAKER_00]: in some ways i go to work feeling like a kid going to school for the first time or something
[00:22:31.170] [SPEAKER_00]：在某种程度上，我去上班感觉就像个孩子第一次去上学一样。
[00:22:36.790] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god are you the youngest that work right now i think me and another cooker are probably
[00:22:36.790] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天哪，你是现在这里最年轻的员工吗？我觉得我和另一个厨师可能是最年轻的。
[00:22:41.490] [SPEAKER_00]: around similar age and i think us two are the youngest oh okay so maybe there's some like
[00:22:41.490] [SPEAKER_00]：年龄差不多，我觉得我们俩是最年轻的。哦，好吧，所以可能有一些……
[00:22:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]: debunking there yeah could be i'm trying to like incorporate personality into everything that i do you
[00:22:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]：驳斥一下，是的，有可能，我试图把个性融入到我做的每一件事中。
[00:22:54.790] [SPEAKER_00]: know like let me write this note with personality we always talk about the dreaded like how is
[00:22:54.790] [SPEAKER_00]：知道吗，让我用个性来写这篇笔记，我们总是谈论可怕的事情，比如……
[00:23:03.490] [SPEAKER_00]: your weekend like i always try to talk about stuff that people can like latch on to associate me with
[00:23:03.490] [SPEAKER_00]：你的周末，就像我总是尽量谈论一些人们会抓住不放、把我跟……联系起来的话题一样。
[00:23:10.390] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah or like use as like a conversation starting point oh okay so other team members will be like
[00:23:10.390] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，或者可以把它当作一个对话的开头，哦，好的，其他团队成员会说：
[00:23:16.050] [SPEAKER_00]: oh it's good i just like hung out with some friends and then i'm like i had a great week
[00:23:16.050] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，挺好的，我和朋友们一起出去玩了一会儿，感觉这周过得很棒。
[00:23:23.920] [SPEAKER_00]: here are all the things that i did this weekend guys let's talk about me
[00:23:23.920] [SPEAKER_00]：伙计们，这就是我这个周末做的所有事情，咱们来聊聊我吧。
[00:23:31.200] [SPEAKER_02]: okay no but i think that's good for sure you're putting yourself out there other people who are like
[00:23:31.200] [SPEAKER_02]：好吧，不，但我认为这很好，你把自己展现出来，让其他人也能像你一样。
[00:23:37.340] [SPEAKER_02]: oh you know i didn't do much the team is probably like oh yeah that's just them you know they're like a
[00:23:37.340] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，你知道我没做什么，团队可能觉得，哦，是啊，他们就是这样，你知道，他们就像……
[00:23:42.280] [SPEAKER_01]: body but now they're like oh wow like these are all the things jesus and joys i know i feel like it's
[00:23:42.280] [SPEAKER_01]：身体，但现在他们就像，哇哦，这些都是耶稣和喜乐，我知道，我觉得就像是
[00:23:49.540] [SPEAKER_00]: like talking the line of like reeks of desperation but also you know i'm just being vulnerable i'm putting
[00:23:49.540] [SPEAKER_00]：就像说这话一样，听起来很绝望，但你知道，我只是在袒露心扉，我只是想表达我的脆弱。
[00:23:54.780] [SPEAKER_00]: myself up and to be clear i'm not going on like a 10 minute rant about what i did but i'll be like oh
[00:23:54.780] [SPEAKER_00]：我自己起来，说清楚点，我不会长篇大论地抱怨我做了什么，但我会说，哦
[00:24:01.120] [SPEAKER_00]: like i did this and that and i'm going here for the first time you know just a little bit more personality
[00:24:01.120] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我做了这个那个，这是我第一次来这里，你知道，稍微多一点个性。
[00:24:06.920] [SPEAKER_02]: than i'd normally would yeah dude in like five months time they'll be like oh what happened to all
[00:24:06.920] [SPEAKER_02]：比我通常的情况要好得多，是啊，伙计，大概五个月后他们就会问，哦，怎么回事？
[00:24:13.000] [SPEAKER_02]: of jesus energy so true you'll be like yeah i didn't do much this weekend they'll be like oh
[00:24:13.000] [SPEAKER_02]：耶稣的能量真是太真实了，你会说，是啊，我这个周末没做什么，他们会说，哦
[00:24:20.880] [SPEAKER_00]: you were so active just five months ago hopefully by then okay here's what i noticed i noticed that
[00:24:20.880] [SPEAKER_00]：你五个月前还很活跃，希望到那时……好吧，我注意到……
[00:24:29.020] [SPEAKER_00]: the team members who are like ought to do much there's follow up questions that are available
[00:24:29.020] [SPEAKER_00]：团队成员应该做很多事情，还有一些后续问题可以解答。
[00:24:33.360] [SPEAKER_00]: because they know each other already oh i see so even if they give like a non answer
[00:24:33.360] [SPEAKER_00]：因为他们彼此认识哦，我明白了，所以即使他们给出模棱两可的回答。
[00:24:37.740] [SPEAKER_00]: people like oh well how's this going or like how's so and so but for me i feel like there's no
[00:24:37.740] [SPEAKER_00]：人们会说“哦，这进展如何？”或者“某某怎么样了？”，但对我来说，我觉得没有。
[00:24:42.800] [SPEAKER_00]: baseline yet so i'm pumping them with as much interest possible so that in five months when i
[00:24:42.800] [SPEAKER_00]：目前还没有基线，所以我尽可能地激发他们的兴趣，这样五个月后当我
[00:24:47.700] [SPEAKER_00]: burn out they'll be like oh i can be called this big by your bitch no literally like i'm just imagining
[00:24:47.700] [SPEAKER_00]：他们累垮了就会说，哦，我可以被你婊子这么叫，不，真的，我只是在想象。
[00:24:54.520] [SPEAKER_02]: you're giving all this information life updates and then suddenly at one point you're just like yeah
[00:24:54.520] [SPEAKER_02]：你一直在提供各种生活近况信息，然后突然间你就突然说，嗯……
[00:24:59.360] [SPEAKER_02]: like i'm a good weekend and people are like wait like what happened to all these storylines you
[00:24:59.360] [SPEAKER_02]：就像我度过了一个美好的周末，然后人们会问，等等，这些故事情节都去哪儿了？
[00:25:04.180] [SPEAKER_02]: are sharing like all of these different aspects of your life we were finally like a drama
[00:25:04.180] [SPEAKER_02]：分享你生活中所有这些不同的方面，我们最终就像在看一部戏剧。
[00:25:09.400] [SPEAKER_00]: and now i'm just cutting us off dude storylines is so funny just Monday morning updates
[00:25:09.400] [SPEAKER_00]：现在我得打断一下大家了，伙计，剧情太搞笑了，周一早上更新。
[00:25:18.140] [SPEAKER_00]: but yeah hopefully in a couple months i'll be like oh my god i have all these work friends and i'm
[00:25:18.140] [SPEAKER_00]：不过，希望几个月后我就会想，天哪，我有这么多工作上的朋友，而且我……
[00:25:25.320] [SPEAKER_00]: calm queen out whatever's on shit so everyone pray for me and if there's anyone out there also like
[00:25:25.320] [SPEAKER_00]：冷静点，女王，不管发生了什么，所以大家为我祈祷，如果有人也这样想的话……
[00:25:32.020] [SPEAKER_00]: sorry i knew job dms so that i don't go alone just kidding good luck to you guys as well she's not kidding
[00:25:32.020] [SPEAKER_00]：不好意思，我知道工作私信是为了避免孤身一人，开玩笑啦，也祝你们好运。她可不是在开玩笑。
[00:25:43.340] [SPEAKER_02]: wait how long did it take for you to make your first work friend in your old job
[00:25:43.340] [SPEAKER_02]：等等，你在上一份工作中花了多久才交到第一个工作朋友？
[00:25:49.360] [SPEAKER_02]: like not necessarily closest friend but just like you know nice generic friend to have
[00:25:49.360] [SPEAKER_02]：不是那种最亲密的朋友，而是那种你知道的，让人感觉不错的普通朋友。
[00:25:54.640] [SPEAKER_00]: so this is actually a crazy story but i think at the time like it maybe took me a month
[00:25:54.640] [SPEAKER_00]：这其实是个很疯狂的故事，但我想当时我可能花了一个月的时间。
[00:26:02.820] [SPEAKER_00]: or so i think it was a little bit easier because there was someone who i started at the same time
[00:26:02.820] [SPEAKER_00]：或者说，我觉得这稍微容易一些，因为当时有一个和我同时开始的人。
[00:26:09.100] [SPEAKER_00]: as she so then she and i like kind of bonded over that and then there was another person who i was
[00:26:09.100] [SPEAKER_00]：因为她，所以我和她就因为这个有点儿亲近了，然后还有另一个人，我当时
[00:26:14.360] [SPEAKER_00]: working with on like a project i she was really nice so then she and i would also like go out and get
[00:26:14.360] [SPEAKER_00]：我和她一起做项目的时候，她人真的很好，所以后来我们俩也经常出去玩。
[00:26:19.560] [SPEAKER_00]: lunch there was someone else who was around my age and i feel like being a new grad is like a very
[00:26:19.560] [SPEAKER_00]：午餐时，还有另一个和我年龄相仿的人，我觉得刚毕业就像……
[00:26:24.220] [SPEAKER_00]: specific experience like you start to look for people who will also look young so then she and i
[00:26:24.220] [SPEAKER_00]：具体的经历，比如你开始寻找看起来也很年轻的人，然后她和我
[00:26:29.360] [SPEAKER_00]: also bonded but i think you're right it's not like i was having major problems at my old company
[00:26:29.360] [SPEAKER_00]：我也签了约，但我觉得你说得对，我在老公司也没遇到什么大问题。
[00:26:35.180] [SPEAKER_00]: making friends it just took some time to feel comfortable and even get exposed to other people
[00:26:35.180] [SPEAKER_00]：交朋友需要一些时间才能感到自在，甚至才能接触到其他人。
[00:26:39.840] [SPEAKER_00]: through work so maybe i just need to wait it out a little bit i have faith in your friend
[00:26:39.840] [SPEAKER_00]：因为工作原因，所以也许我需要再等等。我相信你的朋友。
[00:26:45.920] [SPEAKER_00]: making ability and i'm so close it's just i mean for the most part it's fine it's just like some
[00:26:45.920] [SPEAKER_00]：我正在努力提升能力，而且就差一点点，我的意思是，大部分情况下都还好，只是有些……
[00:26:53.080] [SPEAKER_00]: moments where i'm like sitting at work and people are talking around me and i'm like i'm a
[00:26:53.080] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候我坐在办公室里，周围的人都在聊天，我就想，我……
[00:26:57.940] [SPEAKER_00]: fucking loser but then you know with a surge of energy i like force myself to turn around and
[00:26:57.940] [SPEAKER_00]：真是个彻头彻尾的失败者，但你知道，突然间我精力充沛，强迫自己转身，
[00:27:04.900] [SPEAKER_00]: like engage in the conversation you know yeah i feel like you have to be unafraid to just be the
[00:27:04.900] [SPEAKER_00]：就像参与对话一样，你知道，我觉得你必须无所畏惧，才能做真实的自己。
[00:27:10.140] [SPEAKER_00]: person who puts themselves in the conversation uninvited sometimes yes very very true actually
[00:27:10.140] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候，不请自来地加入对话的人，确实如此，非常非常正确。
[00:27:17.520] [SPEAKER_02]: i completely agree i i know what you're talking about too i think that's happened before to me
[00:27:17.520] [SPEAKER_02]：我完全同意，我也知道你在说什么，我想我以前也遇到过这种情况。
[00:27:22.980] [SPEAKER_02]: as well good literally people like right next to me are talking and i'm like do i engage
[00:27:22.980] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，确实，我旁边的人都在说话，我在想我该不该参与。
[00:27:29.380] [SPEAKER_00]: i'm so scary working and i feel like it's so funny because i just started so everyone knows i'm
[00:27:29.380] [SPEAKER_00]：我工作的时候好紧张，感觉好搞笑，因为我才刚开始，所以大家都知道我……
[00:27:37.200] [SPEAKER_00]: not like really working you know i'm just like learning stuff i basically studying right
[00:27:37.200] [SPEAKER_00]：其实不算真正工作，你知道，我只是在学习一些东西，我基本上是在学习，对吧？
[00:27:43.220] [SPEAKER_00]: my people around me are talking and i'm like focus on my computer who am i convincing like i'm
[00:27:43.220] [SPEAKER_00]：周围的人都在说话，而我却专注于电脑，我到底在说服谁？
[00:27:49.320] [SPEAKER_02]: not doing anything of substance right now yeah they're like what is Jesus doing like we didn't
[00:27:49.320] [SPEAKER_02]：现在什么实质性的事情都没做，是啊，他们好像在问耶稣在干什么，好像我们什么都没做似的。
[00:27:55.020] [SPEAKER_02]: give her any assignments this week what is she doing i know and you're like ingerost in your training
[00:27:55.020] [SPEAKER_02]：这周给她安排点任务吧，她到底在干嘛？我知道，你训练的时候就像个傻瓜一样。
[00:28:02.760] [SPEAKER_00]: i'm like clearly so ingerost that i can't hear the loud conversation around me you're like
[00:28:02.760] [SPEAKER_00]：我完全沉浸其中，听不到周围嘈杂的谈话，你就像
[00:28:08.980] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god this workplace safety video is a movie this is cinema hopefully i'm like a couple
[00:28:08.980] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天哪，这段职场安全视频简直像电影一样，这才是真正的影院！希望我能像一对夫妇一样平安无事。
[00:28:21.230] [SPEAKER_00]: weeks i can listen to this episode and laugh right now i feel like my laughing is like half crying
[00:28:21.230] [SPEAKER_00]：好几周以来，我听这集节目都笑个不停，现在感觉我的笑声像是半哭半笑半笑。
[00:28:26.270] [SPEAKER_02]: okay to be fair though i do feel like if you actually had a work it would be even more of a
[00:28:26.270] [SPEAKER_02]：好吧，公平地说，我觉得如果你真的有作品的话，那就更有意思了。
[00:28:32.450] [SPEAKER_02]: connector to other people you know like right now you're still ramping up learning all the
[00:28:32.450] [SPEAKER_02]：与你认识的其他人建立联系，就像你现在仍在努力学习所有东西一样
[00:28:37.250] [SPEAKER_02]: systems and all that but then later when you actually have work that involves other people that's like
[00:28:37.250] [SPEAKER_02]：系统什么的都明白，但后来当你真正从事需要与其他人合作的工作时，情况就完全不同了。
[00:28:43.210] [SPEAKER_02]: another point of connection so now you're missing that connection you're like yeah i'm just
[00:28:43.210] [SPEAKER_02]：另一个连接点，所以现在你失去了那个连接，你会想，是啊，我只是
[00:28:48.870] [SPEAKER_02]: watching these workplace ethic videos all day and other people are like do what i think that's
[00:28:48.870] [SPEAKER_02]：我整天都在看这些职场道德视频，而其他人却说“照我说的做”，这才是职场道德。
[00:28:55.730] [SPEAKER_00]: also the thing too like i don't have anything to contribute right now and i think literally like
[00:28:55.730] [SPEAKER_00]：还有一点，我现在也没什么可贡献的，我觉得就像……
[00:29:00.670] [SPEAKER_00]: starting next week i will be in that position but right now i'm in the position i'm like oh
[00:29:00.670] [SPEAKER_00]：从下周开始我就会处于那个位置，但现在我的位置是这样的，哦
[00:29:05.590] [SPEAKER_00]: do you understand this and i'm like yeah i think so but i have all these questions and then i'm just like
[00:29:05.590] [SPEAKER_00]：你明白吗？我心想，嗯，我想我明白了，但我还有很多问题，然后我就……
[00:29:10.170] [SPEAKER_00]: i don't know feeling semi useless even though it's not uselessness i'm just training yeah i think
[00:29:10.170] [SPEAKER_00]：我不知道，感觉自己有点没用，虽然不是没用，我只是在训练而已，嗯，我想是这样的。
[00:29:17.810] [SPEAKER_02]: it's like the lack of feeling useful i see i'm not getting to me so you're like shit not only am i not
[00:29:17.810] [SPEAKER_02]：感觉就像是缺乏一种无用感，我明白自己无法掌控局面，所以你会想，糟了，我不仅没能掌控局面
[00:29:24.990] [SPEAKER_02]: providing valuable work right now but i'm also not making friends yeah i know but you know i'm ramping up
[00:29:24.990] [SPEAKER_02]：我现在的工作很有价值，但我也没交到朋友，我知道，但你知道我正在努力。
[00:29:34.970] [SPEAKER_00]: the social situation okay i believe it why did that sound so unconvincing when i said i believe
[00:29:34.970] [SPEAKER_00]：社交场合的情况还好，我相信。为什么我说“我相信”的时候听起来那么没有说服力？
[00:29:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]: it i believe it i believe it robot voice do you eat lunch alone i don't so i've never eaten lunch alone
[00:29:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]：我相信，我相信，机器人声音。你一个人吃午饭吗？我不吃，所以我从来没有一个人吃过午饭。
[00:29:54.830] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god wait i'm like very impressed i literally have been working with the same team for like
[00:29:54.830] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天啊，等等，我真是太佩服了，我跟同一个团队一起工作了……
[00:30:00.370] [SPEAKER_02]: two years almost three and i literally eat lunch alone like every day but that's like a little bit
[00:30:00.370] [SPEAKER_02]：两年了，快三年了，我几乎每天都一个人吃午饭，但这也只是很小一部分。
[00:30:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]: more out of choice i think because i yeah it's the introvert in me yeah it's like your time to recharge
[00:30:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得更多是出于选择，因为，嗯，这是我内向的一面在作祟，嗯，就像是给自己充电的时间。
[00:30:14.830] [SPEAKER_02]: exactly recharge from the very minimal social work i'm doing anyway but i do feel like lunch is
[00:30:14.830] [SPEAKER_02]：确实需要从我目前做的极少的社会工作中恢复过来，但我确实觉得午餐是……
[00:30:22.910] [SPEAKER_02]: pretty crucial in like you know building friendships especially if it's like one on one lunch like
[00:30:22.910] [SPEAKER_02]：这对于建立友谊来说非常重要，尤其是在一对一的午餐时间。
[00:30:28.910] [SPEAKER_02]: forced to befriend the person across from you that is true i realized it's actually not that hard
[00:30:28.910] [SPEAKER_02]：被迫和对面的人交朋友，这倒是真的，我意识到其实没那么难。
[00:30:36.110] [SPEAKER_00]: to like keep the conversation going which was one of my fears i was like would i be able to hold
[00:30:36.110] [SPEAKER_00]：我想让对话继续下去，这也是我之前担心的，我当时在想我能不能坚持下去。
[00:30:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]: this conversation and also because like i had mentioned lunch convoes aren't my like favorite
[00:30:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]：这段对话，还有，就像我之前提到的，午餐时的谈话并不是我最喜欢的。
[00:30:46.730] [SPEAKER_00]: thing in the world you know like i don't i don't i don't know it's like the eating while talking kind of
[00:30:46.730] [SPEAKER_00]：世界上有件事你知道，但我不知道，我不知道，我不知道，就像边吃边说那种感觉一样。

[00:30:50.950] [SPEAKER_00]：哦我的天，没错，没有和GCU一起吃午饭了，好吧，我正在努力，但你知道，我刚刚意识到
[00:31:00.410] [SPEAKER_00]: there's like so much to talk about lowkey and you just have to search for the right
[00:31:00.410] [SPEAKER_00]：其实有很多话想说，只是需要找到合适的表达方式。
[00:31:06.050] [SPEAKER_02]: the perfect conversation topic like you're still feeling around to find the right connection
[00:31:06.050] [SPEAKER_02]：这是一个完美的谈话话题，就像你还在摸索如何找到合适的联系一样。
[00:31:10.650] [SPEAKER_02]: right exactly well imagine like five months later you're like okay actually guys please stop
[00:31:10.650] [SPEAKER_02]：没错，想象一下，大概五个月后，你就会说：好了好了，各位，别说了。
[00:31:16.630] [SPEAKER_02]: having lunch with me i actually hate eating lunch with other people i'm like i know i've been
[00:31:16.630] [SPEAKER_02]：跟我一起吃午饭，我其实很讨厌跟别人一起吃午饭，我知道我一直都是这样。
[00:31:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]: pretending this entire time but i don't fuck with lunch they're like oh my god
[00:31:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]：我一直都在装，但我根本不吃午饭，他们都说“我的天哪”。
[00:31:31.470] [SPEAKER_00]: but you know work aside i happen having like a mini crisis in the last like two days or so
[00:31:31.470] [SPEAKER_00]：不过你知道，抛开工作不谈，我最近两天左右遇到了一点小危机。
[00:31:40.010] [SPEAKER_00]: and let me start it like this like have you played roe blocks before?
[00:31:40.010] [SPEAKER_00]：那我就这样开始吧，你以前玩过《鱼卵方块》吗？
[00:31:44.210] [SPEAKER_02]: no oh my god i think i know where this is going so i haven't played roe blocks but i do
[00:31:44.210] [SPEAKER_02]：不，我的天哪，我想我知道接下来会发生什么了。我没玩过《Roe Blocks》，但我确实玩过。
[00:31:51.210] [SPEAKER_00]: know something is very popular in roe blocks yes yes so i've also never played roe blocks but
[00:31:51.210] [SPEAKER_00]：我知道《Roe Blocks》很受欢迎，是的，是的，所以我也没玩过《Roe Blocks》，但是
[00:31:59.230] [SPEAKER_00]: i saw some videos pop up on my TikTok feed recently where it was the skydamed k-so
[00:31:59.230] [SPEAKER_00]：我最近在TikTok上看到一些视频，是关于天空毁灭的K-SO的。
[00:32:05.410] [SPEAKER_00]: who's like a streamer and he's been playing dressed in press on roe blocks
[00:32:05.410] [SPEAKER_00]：他就像个主播，一直在穿着紧身衣在鱼卵块上玩游戏
[00:32:08.810] [SPEAKER_00]: you hit! not only is it super funny watching this like random dude get really into like dress up
[00:32:08.810] [SPEAKER_00]：你打中了！看着这个路人甲对角色扮演如此痴迷，不仅超级搞笑，而且还很滑稽。
[00:32:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]: games i also have a long and deep history with dress up games myself and i used to play a
[00:32:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]：游戏方面，我自己也对换装游戏有着很深的了解，我以前经常玩……
[00:32:24.950] [SPEAKER_00]: ton of them on like junior neighbor dot com when i was young so seeing it come back i'm like oh my god
[00:32:24.950] [SPEAKER_00]：我小时候在像 junior neighbor dot com 这样的网站上看到过很多，所以看到它又回来了，我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。
[00:32:30.490] [SPEAKER_00]: this is amazing i literally watched like every single video that he's done i could not get enough
[00:32:30.490] [SPEAKER_00]：太棒了！我几乎看完了他所有的视频，根本停不下来。
[00:32:35.910] [SPEAKER_00]: so i downloaded roe blocks which i did not know you could play this on your phone i thought it was
[00:32:35.910] [SPEAKER_00]：所以我下载了 Roe Blocks，我之前不知道这个游戏可以在手机上玩，我以为它只能在手机上玩。
[00:32:41.690] [SPEAKER_00]: like a PC game only i didn't know that either i know so i downloaded it and started playing
[00:32:41.690] [SPEAKER_00]：就像电脑游戏一样，只不过我之前也不知道，现在知道了，就下载下来开始玩了。
[00:32:47.930] [SPEAKER_00]: dressed in press and it's so hard on the wall or we hard yeah and here's what makes it
[00:32:47.930] [SPEAKER_00]：穿着媒体服装，这在墙上很难看清，或者我们很难看清，是的，这就是它的原因。
[00:32:55.130] [SPEAKER_00]: hard you're not just putting together clothing pieces you have to walk your character around and
[00:32:55.130] [SPEAKER_00]：难就难在，你不只是把衣服搭配起来，你还得让你的角色走来走去，
[00:32:59.690] [SPEAKER_00]: find them you know you're not like browsing a catalogue you have to like physically go and find
[00:32:59.690] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，找到它们可不是像浏览目录那样，你得亲自去寻找。
[00:33:04.310] [SPEAKER_00]: clothing item and then there's like a bunch of patterns and colors you can do and you can
[00:33:04.310] [SPEAKER_00]：服装单品，然后还有很多图案和颜色可以选择，你可以……
[00:33:10.070] [SPEAKER_00]: customize like the colors of each clothing item right but the true magic of roe blocks comes from
[00:33:10.070] [SPEAKER_00]：可以像自定义每件衣服的颜色一样进行自定义，但鱼卵块真正的魔力在于……
[00:33:16.010] [SPEAKER_00]: your ability to layer clothing items because you can imagine it right it's like there's like a
[00:33:16.010] [SPEAKER_00]：你能够叠穿衣服，因为你可以想象，就像……
[00:33:21.010] [SPEAKER_00]: tank top a t-shirt address whatever there's only like so much you could do if you just have one
[00:33:21.010] [SPEAKER_00]：背心、T恤、地址什么的，如果你只有一件，你能做的也就那么多。
[00:33:26.710] [SPEAKER_00]: top one bottom but when you layer like four tops in like the perfect order and the perfect shades
[00:33:26.710] [SPEAKER_00]：从上到下，但是当你把四件上衣以完美的顺序和完美的色调叠穿在一起时……
[00:33:33.690] [SPEAKER_00]: layer stockings and then socks over your stockings and the boots and then you know like all these
[00:33:33.690] [SPEAKER_00]：先穿几层长筒袜，然后在长筒袜外面再穿袜子，再穿靴子，然后你知道的，就像所有这些一样。
[00:33:38.550] [SPEAKER_00]: accessories that's where the magic happened and i'm like pretty sure i'm playing with 12
[00:33:38.550] [SPEAKER_00]：配件，奇迹就发生在那里，我几乎可以肯定我玩的是12个。
[00:33:45.770] [SPEAKER_00]: year olds unfortunately just by the way they type unlike you are not like a full grown adult
[00:33:45.770] [SPEAKER_00]：很遗憾，从他们的打字方式来看，这些年纪小的孩子不像你，他们不像个成年人。
[00:33:50.070] [SPEAKER_00]: but they're fucking good oh my gosh so good okay i think dressed to impress is so funny
[00:33:50.070] [SPEAKER_00]：但是它们真的太棒了，我的天哪，太棒啦！我觉得《盛装打扮》这首歌太搞笑了。
[00:33:58.010] [SPEAKER_02]: yeah because i've also seen a bunch of guy streamers get into it like you know some random
[00:33:58.010] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，因为我也看到很多男主播也这么干，你知道，就像一些随机的。
[00:34:05.210] [SPEAKER_02]: time like a fellow streamer friend is like oh my god like we should totally try out this game
[00:34:05.210] [SPEAKER_02]：就像我的一个主播朋友说的那样，我的天哪，我们应该赶紧试试这个游戏。
[00:34:10.810] [SPEAKER_02]: and the guys are like i mean okay sure and then they you know they dress up their character they do
[00:34:10.810] [SPEAKER_02]：然后那些家伙就说，好吧，当然，然后他们你知道，他们会装扮成自己的角色，他们会这么做。
[00:34:16.050] [SPEAKER_02]: the walk in the pose yeah the girl is usually like oh my god like you did really well and then
[00:34:16.050] [SPEAKER_02]：摆出那个姿势走路，女孩通常会说“我的天哪，你做得真棒”，然后
[00:34:22.130] [SPEAKER_02]: guys stars being like a town you know i did do really like really start to get into
[00:34:22.130] [SPEAKER_02]：伙计们，明星就像一座小镇，你知道，我真的开始喜欢上它们了。
[00:34:30.650] [SPEAKER_02]: okay my theory here is that i feel like a lot of girls were like super into the dress up games
[00:34:30.650] [SPEAKER_02]：好吧，我的理论是，我觉得很多女孩都超级喜欢换装游戏。
[00:34:36.810] [SPEAKER_02]: like you remember playing a lot of them too but guys didn't right so they missed out on this like
[00:34:36.810] [SPEAKER_02]：就像你也记得玩过很多这类游戏一样，但有些人不记得，所以他们错过了这些。
[00:34:43.430] [SPEAKER_02]: key experience so now they're like rove locks you know they're they're getting the experience
[00:34:43.430] [SPEAKER_02]：关键经验，所以现在他们就像漫游锁一样，你知道，他们正在获得经验
[00:34:49.090] [SPEAKER_02]: they're feeling the high of like dressing up your character and be like damn like they look
[00:34:49.090] [SPEAKER_02]：他们享受着扮演角色的那种兴奋感，然后惊叹自己看起来棒极了。
[00:34:53.230] [SPEAKER_00]: fucking good yeah yeah i fear i ate dude here's the crazy thing so there's like free play
[00:34:53.230] [SPEAKER_00]：真他妈爽，是啊是啊，我怕我吃了，伙计，这事儿太疯狂了，所以就像是免费游戏。
[00:35:01.950] [SPEAKER_00]: on dressed to impress roe blocks and stuff but for the most part i fact the main game is like a contest
[00:35:01.950] [SPEAKER_00]：关于盛装打扮、鱼卵块之类的东西，但实际上，游戏的大部分内容就像一场比赛。
[00:35:07.330] [SPEAKER_00]: so there's like a voting system where you walk down the catwalk and you vote on everyone's outfits
[00:35:07.330] [SPEAKER_00]：所以这里有个投票系统，你走下T台，然后对每个人的服装进行投票。
[00:35:13.150] [SPEAKER_00]: i just find this game very hard in general and i have only gotten first twice okay once was
[00:35:13.150] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得这游戏真的很难，我只拿过两次第一，好吧，还有一次是……
[00:35:21.090] [SPEAKER_00]: the theme was decades and then i was like decades like what can i do and then i thought i could do
[00:35:21.090] [SPEAKER_00]：主题是“年代”，然后我就想，‘年代’这个词我能做什么呢？然后我想，我可以做什么？
[00:35:26.530] [SPEAKER_00]: the girlfriend clueless you know like curling yellow two peas so i slayed that and i got first and i was
[00:35:26.530] [SPEAKER_00]：女朋友一窍不通，你知道，就像卷曲的黄色豌豆一样，所以我干掉了她，我得了第一名，我是
[00:35:32.630] [SPEAKER_00]: like oh my god this is amazing i am high on this win but the other time i got first it was actually
[00:35:32.630] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，这太棒了，我为这场胜利感到兴奋，但上次我拿到第一名的时候，其实是……
[00:35:40.530] [SPEAKER_00]: games playing oh and i have to show you the photo to illustrate this wait then does that even mean
[00:35:40.530] [SPEAKER_00]：玩游戏，哦，我得给你们看张照片来说明这一点，等等，那这到底是什么意思？
[00:35:47.470] [SPEAKER_00]: that you got first oh wait but let me show you so this is this is my outfit that one oh i like it
[00:35:47.470] [SPEAKER_00]：你先拿到的，哦等等，让我给你看看，这是我的衣服，就是这套，哦，我喜欢它
[00:35:56.750] [SPEAKER_00]: i was like this is a sleigh when james won i just cannot believe that they voted this first place
[00:35:56.750] [SPEAKER_00]：詹姆斯赢的时候我就觉得这简直就是雪橇，我简直不敢相信他们居然把票投给了他。
[00:36:07.090] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god and this was his first time using the platform we were even having trouble finding
[00:36:07.090] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，这是他第一次使用这个平台，我们甚至都找不到。
[00:36:16.450] [SPEAKER_00]: where to give the roe blocks character like a skin color so he was just like accidentally clicking
[00:36:16.450] [SPEAKER_00]：给鱼卵块赋予颜色之类的特性，就像给它们加上肤色一样，所以他只是不小心点了一下。
[00:36:21.510] [SPEAKER_02]: everything did it know how to unclick stuff so for our listeners it's literally a roebot mask
[00:36:21.510] [SPEAKER_02]：它知道如何取消点击，所以对于我们的听众来说，它实际上就是一个机器人面具。
[00:36:29.150] [SPEAKER_00]: on the person's head and she's wearing like four t-shirts green leggings and no shoes no hair
[00:36:29.150] [SPEAKER_00]：那人头上戴着东西，穿着四件T恤、绿色紧身裤，没穿鞋，也没头发。
[00:36:37.430] [SPEAKER_02]: this was what his competition was oh my god there's like second is like sailor moonask third i
[00:36:37.430] [SPEAKER_02]：这就是他的竞争对手，我的天哪，第二名就像是美少女战士，第三名……
[00:36:44.230] [SPEAKER_00]: can't see third was also like a sailor moon okay for that one the theme was anime or something
[00:36:44.230] [SPEAKER_00]：看不到第三个，也像美少女战士，好吧，那个主题是动漫之类的。
[00:36:49.490] [SPEAKER_00]: basically i realized what happened was there's like a little chat box and i didn't even see it
[00:36:49.490] [SPEAKER_00]：基本上，我意识到发生了什么事，就是有个小小的聊天框，但我根本没看到。
[00:36:54.110] [SPEAKER_00]: until after it ever unfolded what happened was everyone was complaining that all the sailor moons
[00:36:54.110] [SPEAKER_00]：直到事情真相大白之后，大家才开始抱怨所有的美少女战士……
[00:36:58.970] [SPEAKER_00]: for the anime theme were so basic that they voted everyone else low and voted my character
[00:36:58.970] [SPEAKER_00]：因为动漫主题太普通了，所以他们把其他人的票都投得很低，反而投了我的角色。
[00:37:05.370] [SPEAKER_00]: who is wearing like four t-shirts and leggings with no hair no skin color no shoes they voted that
[00:37:05.370] [SPEAKER_00]：那些穿着四件T恤和紧身裤，没头发，没肤色，没穿鞋的人，他们投了票。
[00:37:11.090] [SPEAKER_00]: up because they were like oh this is like clearly a newbie i don't care but like these other people
[00:37:11.090] [SPEAKER_00]：因为他们觉得，哦，这显然是个新手，我不在乎，但是像其他人一样。
[00:37:17.210] [SPEAKER_00]: were being basic like i'm not going to vote them high oh there's like fucking roe blocks dressed in
[00:37:17.210] [SPEAKER_00]：我们太普通了，我不会给他们高票，哦，那里就像他妈的鱼卵块穿着衣服
[00:37:22.510] [SPEAKER_02]: politics yes because i was gonna say your roe blocks character that one has nothing to do with
[00:37:22.510] [SPEAKER_02]：政治方面，没错，因为我本来想说你的罗伊案阻碍了你的性格，但这跟政治无关。
[00:37:31.550] [SPEAKER_00]: i don't even i can't even remember what he was going for like rocklee or something for anime
[00:37:31.550] [SPEAKER_00]：我甚至都记不清他想模仿的是李洛克还是其他什么动漫角色了。
[00:37:37.230] [SPEAKER_02]: all right anime yeah also this makes me wonder because you said a lot of the people are
[00:37:37.230] [SPEAKER_02]：好的，动漫，还有，这让我很疑惑，因为你说很多人都……
[00:37:43.610] [SPEAKER_02]: clearly like young who are playing roe blocks you know how you dressed up one girl as clueless
[00:37:43.610] [SPEAKER_02]：很明显，就像那些玩积木的年轻人一样，你知道你把一个女孩打扮成懵懂无知的样子。
[00:37:48.630] [SPEAKER_02]: like what if they don't even know the reference they're just like oh wow that's so cute
[00:37:48.630] [SPEAKER_02]：万一他们根本不知道这个梗，只会觉得“哇，好可爱”呢？
[00:37:53.670] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah that i yeah honestly that could be a possibility so what if you just keep taking outfits
[00:37:53.670] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊，说实话，这确实有可能。那如果你一直换衣服呢？
[00:38:01.050] [SPEAKER_02]: from like older things and then people will be like oh my god that's like so new and fresh
[00:38:01.050] [SPEAKER_02]：就像从一些老东西里找灵感，然后人们会说，我的天哪，这太新潮太新鲜了。
[00:38:05.770] [SPEAKER_00]: like we've never seen that before where i'm dead hey our favorite court phrase there's no need to
[00:38:05.770] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我们以前从未见过的那样，我死了，嘿，我们最喜欢的法庭用语，没必要
[00:38:16.310] [SPEAKER_00]: some dress to impress clips later oh my god yes wait okay you should play it it's so fun
[00:38:16.310] [SPEAKER_00]：稍后会放一些“盛装打扮”的片段，哦我的天哪，是的，等等，好吧，你应该玩玩，它真的很有趣。
[00:38:23.410] [SPEAKER_00]: and i think a lot of the fun comes from seeing what outfits other people can make because that's
[00:38:23.410] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得很多乐趣都来自于看看其他人能搭配出什么样的服装，因为那才是……
[00:38:29.910] [SPEAKER_00]: really fun for me like i don't care about my placements honestly i'm like usually dead last anyway
[00:38:29.910] [SPEAKER_00]：对我来说真的很有趣，说实话我根本不在乎名次，反正我通常都是垫底的。
[00:38:34.270] [SPEAKER_00]: but seeing the magic of other people's outfits i'm like how the fuck did you do that like we all
[00:38:34.270] [SPEAKER_00]：但是看到别人穿搭的魔力，我就会想，你到底是怎么做到的？我们所有人都会这样想。
[00:38:39.690] [SPEAKER_00]: only had four minutes or whatever it is so is it like you're just running around in a mall
[00:38:39.690] [SPEAKER_00]：只有四分钟左右的时间，所以感觉就像在商场里到处乱逛一样吗？
[00:38:44.870] [SPEAKER_02]: and then you like meet back at the runaway point or something yeah you're kind of like walking
[00:38:44.870] [SPEAKER_02]：然后你们就像在逃跑点之类的地方碰面，嗯，你们就像在散步一样。
[00:38:50.910] [SPEAKER_00]: around in a big yeah kind of like a mall it's not that big but there's like a salon there's
[00:38:50.910] [SPEAKER_00]：就在附近，有点像购物中心，其实也没那么大，但是里面有个美发沙龙。
[00:38:56.730] [SPEAKER_00]: like a skin tanning thingy the magic comes from the pattern that the color schemes interesting
[00:38:56.730] [SPEAKER_00]：就像晒黑一样，神奇之处在于色彩搭配的图案，这很有趣。
[00:39:04.070] [SPEAKER_00]: well how is that a crisis okay i think the crisis part is like i don't know i feel like i just
[00:39:04.070] [SPEAKER_00]：嗯，这怎么能算危机呢？好吧，我觉得危机的部分就像……我不知道，我感觉我只是
[00:39:11.110] [SPEAKER_00]: played so much dress up games growing up that i thought i would slay this oh but everyone is so much
[00:39:11.110] [SPEAKER_00]：小时候玩了那么多换装游戏，我以为我能轻松驾驭这个，结果每个人都好难搞。
[00:39:17.090] [SPEAKER_00]: better and not only that i feel like the mechanics of moving around in roblox is so new and foreign
[00:39:17.090] [SPEAKER_00]：不仅如此，我觉得 Roblox 的移动机制非常新颖独特，让我感觉很陌生。
[00:39:22.450] [SPEAKER_00]: to me that i felt like i was doing it in a very clunky way i was trying to zoom out so that i could
[00:39:22.450] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得我当时的操作很笨拙，我试图拉远镜头，这样我就可以……
[00:39:27.650] [SPEAKER_00]: get a better sense of where i was going and stuff and i was like making myself nauseous i was like
[00:39:27.650] [SPEAKER_00]：为了更好地了解我要去哪里之类的，我感觉自己快要吐了，我当时就想
[00:39:32.510] [SPEAKER_00]: oh god like i don't know how to work these controls and for the first time i felt like i was
[00:39:32.510] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，天哪，我好像不知道怎么用这些控件，而且我第一次感觉自己像个傻瓜。
[00:39:38.090] [SPEAKER_00]: technology a little bit oh my god i know that's very dramatic but like no i understand
[00:39:38.090] [SPEAKER_00]：科技有点……哦我的天哪，我知道这很夸张，但是，不，我明白。
[00:39:44.430] [SPEAKER_02]: your life what is this technology yeah i was like how do i move you're like how do i get to
[00:39:44.430] [SPEAKER_02]：你的生活，这是什么技术？是啊，我当时想，我该怎么移动？你又说，我该怎么到达……
[00:39:52.330] [SPEAKER_01]: the hair salon i need to get to the salon James like fucking put this roba mask
[00:39:52.330] [SPEAKER_01]：我得去理发店，詹姆斯就像他妈的给我戴上这个罗巴面具一样。
[00:40:01.210] [SPEAKER_02]: it's like i'm broccoli first place so when you can play it on your phone is it like a
[00:40:01.210] [SPEAKER_02]：感觉就像我是西兰花第一名，所以当你能在手机上玩的时候，是不是就像……
[00:40:08.910] [SPEAKER_02]: specific robax dressed in press or is it like robax and then you have to find dressed in press
[00:40:08.910] [SPEAKER_02]：特定的 Robax 穿着印有“press”字样的衣服，还是像 Robax 那样，然后你必须找到穿着印有“press”字样的衣服？
