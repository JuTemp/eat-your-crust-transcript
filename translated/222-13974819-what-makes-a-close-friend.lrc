[00:00:00.240] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. So before we jump into our topic today, I have a funny story. And to me personally, it's kind of a sad story actually. Oh. So let me start by- But it'll be funny to me?
[00:00:00.240] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。在我们正式开始今天的话题之前，我先讲个好笑的故事。不过对我个人而言，这其实是个有点悲伤的故事。哦。那么，让我先说说——但对我来说，这会很有趣吧？
[00:00:27.550] Maybe. Actually, this is the fucking curse again where I'm like, this is a funny story. And then later I'm like, is anyone gonna laugh? But basically, for context for anyone who doesn't know me in real life,
[00:00:27.550] 也许吧。其实，这该死的毛病又犯了，我一开始觉得这故事挺搞笑的，但过一会儿又会想，会有人笑吗？不过，简单来说，给那些不认识我的人解释一下：
[00:00:39.150] I have really long hair. So I've been kind of growing it out too for the wedding. So right now it reaches my belly button-ish, which is pretty nice for when I want to curl it
[00:00:39.150] 我的头发很长，为了婚礼，我一直在留长。现在头发差不多到肚脐眼了，这样卷发的时候很方便。
[00:00:50.670] and like look nice and stuff. But in the day to day lifestyle, it's actually really annoying because I get like sweaty around my neck area if I'm in a really warm environment, or it gets like tangled in my piercing sometimes or like,
[00:00:50.670] 而且看起来也挺好看的。但在日常生活中，它其实很烦人，因为如果环境很热，我的脖子周围就会出汗，或者有时候它会缠住我的耳钉之类的，
[00:01:06.030] you know, it's just kind of like in the way all the time. So I usually have it up in a claw clip. And I would actually say that if you hang out with me
[00:01:06.030] 你知道，它总是碍事。所以我通常把它夹在发夹里。而且我其实会说，如果你跟我一起玩的话。
[00:01:14.830] in real life, you probably see me more with it up in a clip than it down. That's true. I haven't seen you with your hair down in a while. Dude, right? I don't know what is wrong with me. So this is the fucking problem
[00:01:14.830] 现实生活中，你可能经常看到我把头发扎起来而不是披散着。没错。我也好久没见你披着头发了。哥们儿，对吧？我也不知道自己怎么了。所以这就是问题所在。
[00:01:27.390] that caused my sad slash funny story. So I was on a video call with my co-worker, and she lives a little bit further from the office. And she's also part time. So I've never actually met her in real life, even though we've worked together for like three,
[00:01:27.390] 这就引出了我这个既悲又好笑的故事。当时我和一位同事视频通话，她住的地方离办公室有点远，而且她是兼职的。所以尽管我们已经一起工作了三年，但我从未在现实生活中见过她。
[00:01:41.390] four years, maybe. Oh, wow. And she's awesome. Like, she's super cool. And we always get all of our work stuff done and then have some minimal small talk before and after the meeting.
[00:01:41.390] 四年吧。哇哦。她超棒的。真的，她酷毙了。我们总能把工作上的事情都做完，然后在会议前后简单聊几句。
[00:01:51.550] She was like, Oh, you know, I saw you the other day in this like huge work call. And for that big work call, I went into work. So the camera, you know, the ones hanging on a TV
[00:01:51.550] 她当时就说：“哦，你知道吗，我前几天在一个很重要的工作会议上看到你了。”为了参加那个重要的工作会议，我特地去上班了。你知道，就是电视机上挂着的那种摄像头。
[00:02:02.590] on the wall in like office meeting room. Yeah, it showed like the full body instead of just the webcam. That day, I actually curled my hair. So I was like, I'm not going to put it up in a clip.
[00:02:02.590] 就像在办公室会议室的墙上。对，它显示的是全身像，而不是摄像头画面。那天我还特意卷了头发。所以我就想，我可不想用发夹夹起来。
[00:02:14.030] I'll just leave it down. And it's kind of cold anyway. So I was like, it wouldn't get all annoying and everything. And she was like, I never knew you had long hair. I always thought you had
[00:02:14.030] 我就让它披着吧。反正现在也挺冷的。所以我就想，这样也不会太碍事。然后她说，我以前都不知道你留长发。我一直以为你只有……
[00:02:21.310] short hair because of our video calls. And at first I was just like, Oh, that's so funny. And then later I was thinking about it. And I was like, in a webcam, if my hair is up in a clip,
[00:02:21.310] 因为视频通话，我的头发剪短了。一开始我只是觉得，哦，这太搞笑了。后来我一直在想，在网络摄像头前，如果我的头发用发夹夹起来，
[00:02:31.950] it literally makes me look like I'm bald. Like, I actually was so like, it was like deeply upsetting to me. Because really, like you can't see anything except maybe just like the top bangs, but even like
[00:02:31.950] 它真的让我看起来像个秃子。说真的，我当时真的非常难过。因为真的，除了头顶的刘海，什么都看不见，但即使是这样……
[00:02:46.030] my bangs are growing out. So they're just like all clipped back. So it almost looks like I have like a buzz cut or like a really short cut or something out. And I was just like, Oh my god,
[00:02:46.030] 我的刘海正在长长，所以现在都用发夹夹在后面。看起来就像我剪了个寸头或者超短发一样。我当时就想，我的天哪！
[00:02:56.350] like this is causing me extreme distress. Wait, take your headphones off for a second. Let me take a good look at this. Oh, you know what I mean? Like right now it's down.
[00:02:56.350] 这让我非常难受。等等，先把耳机摘下来。让我仔细看看。哦，你明白我的意思吗？就像现在这样，它断线了。
[00:03:08.430] But when it's in a clip, I literally realized I look like I'm fucking bald. So I was I was really upset. And in a joking way, like I obviously wasn't sad or anything. But now I'm just thinking,
[00:03:08.430] 但当视频剪辑出来后，我才意识到自己看起来像个秃子。我当时真的挺沮丧的。当然，我是开玩笑的，我其实并没有真的难过什么的。但现在我一直在想，
[00:03:21.790] should I throw out all my claw clips? Because it's such a force of habit. Like, once I'm used to it, I just always use it. So yeah. Dang, okay, I can kind of see it after you took your headphones off. Dude, right?
[00:03:21.790] 我该把所有爪夹都扔掉吗？因为这已经成了习惯。就像，一旦习惯了，我就总是用它。所以，嗯。哎，好吧，你摘下耳机后我好像能看出来。哥们儿，对吧？
[00:03:36.910] Hard to tell because I feel like it's a 5050. You know, like, Oh, either this person has their hair up or they have a short pixie cut or something. Right. And also, I realized what also probably made it worse was at work, I always have a
[00:03:36.910] 很难说，因为我觉得五五开。你知道，就像，哦，这个人要么把头发扎起来了，要么剪了个超短的精灵头什么的。对。而且，我还意识到，可能让情况更糟的一点是，在工作中，我总是……
[00:03:51.550] virtual background on. And because it's kind of green screeny, it kind of blurs out all the edges. So I was like, she probably thought I was bald this entire time.
[00:03:51.550] 虚拟背景开启了。因为它有点像绿幕，所以边缘都模糊了。所以我就想，她可能一直以为我是秃头。
[00:04:04.850] Oh my god. Okay, maybe what you need is to clip your hair but like have it poop up in the back. Yeah. Wait, that's low key genius or like a high pony where it's like, literally at the top of my skull.
[00:04:04.850] 我的天哪。好吧，也许你需要把头发夹起来，但让后面的头发蓬松起来。嗯。等等，这简直太妙了，或者扎个高马尾，马尾都快顶到头顶了。
[00:04:21.570] Like, hey guys, I have hair. It's right here. Oh my god. That is pretty funny though. That was my very distressing story. What about like if you didn't have a virtual background? I think that would help. But I mean, you're gonna see now but my virtual background has
[00:04:21.570] 嘿，伙计们，我有头发。就在这儿。我的天哪。不过这还挺搞笑的。那是我非常沮丧的经历。如果你没有虚拟背景呢？我觉得那样会好一些。但我的意思是，你现在会看到，我的虚拟背景……
[00:04:45.390] a mirrored closet sort of showing. Yeah, then every time I don't have a virtual background on, even like accidentally sometimes people are always like, Oh, like I see James in the back. Because, you know, that's perfectly where James's desk is actually.
[00:04:45.390] 镜子里的衣柜好像露了出来。是啊，然后每次我没设虚拟背景的时候，哪怕是无意中，人们总是会说：“哦，我看到詹姆斯在后面了。” 因为，你知道，那其实就是詹姆斯的办公桌所在的地方。
[00:05:00.270] Yeah, that's true. That's pretty tough if it's like pretty necessary to have a background. I don't think you have to throw away your claw clips, but you might have to come up with a creative way to have your hair poking out somehow.
[00:05:00.270] 没错，确实如此。如果一定要有背景的话，那就挺棘手的。我觉得你不用扔掉发夹，但你可能需要想个办法，让头发稍微露出来一点。
[00:05:15.390] Yeah, or just claw clips are cancelled. Everyone tell your friends. I also have a kind of funny story that is also related to work. So you know how like, we all go into the office a little more often nowadays. I usually go into the office around
[00:05:15.390] 是啊，或者说爪夹子都取消了。大家都告诉朋友们。我还有个跟工作有关的趣事。你知道，现在我们都更频繁地去办公室了。我通常大约在……去办公室。
[00:05:36.750] three times a week. And I'm seeing more and more people in the office. And I'm getting to know people who sit near me as well. So earlier this week, I was in a meeting with this dude,
[00:05:36.750] 每周三次。而且我在办公室里见到的人越来越多。我也开始认识坐在我附近的人。所以这周早些时候，我和一个家伙开会，
[00:05:49.710] and we're talking about like some slides, some design stuff that I was going to help him with. All good, super nice guy. And then later in the same day, I'm like walking along in the halls,
[00:05:49.710] 我们当时在聊一些幻灯片之类的东西，还有一些设计方面的东西，我本来打算帮他做的。一切都很顺利，他人也非常好。然后当天晚些时候，我走在走廊里，
[00:06:01.950] and I see him. And he says hey to me. And I'm trying to say hey back, but dude, but instead of like a hey coming out, it's like a squeak. Oh my god. Can you recreate it? Okay, yeah, let me try. It was something like, hey.
[00:06:01.950] 我看到他了。他跟我打招呼。我也想回应他，但是，老兄，我发出的不是正常的“嘿”，而是像吱吱叫一样的声音。我的天哪。你能模仿一下吗？好的，我试试。大概是“嘿”之类的。
[00:06:24.670] Wait, no, it was higher than that. Here, let me try again. It was like, hey. At that volume, like quiet. Yeah, it was super quiet. It was actually higher than that, like much more squeaky. And like,
[00:06:24.670] 等等，不对，比这还高。来，我再试一次。感觉就像，嘿。在那个音量下，声音很小。对，非常小。实际上比这高得多，声音更尖锐。而且，
[00:06:39.390] you can't even tell if it's actually a word. I could see the confusion entering his face. And then he heard the noise, but he wasn't sure if it was like a hey back or like an accidental
[00:06:39.390] 你甚至都无法判断那是不是个词。我看到他脸上露出困惑的表情。然后他听到了那个声音，但他不确定那像是回应的“嘿”，还是像一声意外的……
[00:06:52.830] squeak or like a throat clearing or something. But then I was like so embarrassed. I was like, dude, if I talk again, it might be another squeak. So we just had like awkward eye contact
[00:06:52.830] 我当时发出了一声吱吱声，或者像是清嗓子什么的。但我当时特别尴尬，心想，老兄，如果我再说话，说不定又会发出吱吱声。所以我们俩就尴尬地对视了一会儿。
[00:07:08.450] for two seconds or so. And I was like, I'm just gonna scurry back to my desk. Wait, I have so many questions. Like, did you smile at him? Yes, I tried to save it with a smile. But it was probably an awkward smile because,
[00:07:08.450] 大概持续了两秒钟左右。然后我就想，我还是赶紧跑回我的桌子吧。等等，我还有好多问题想问。比如，你当时对他笑了吗？是的，我试图用微笑来挽回局面。但那笑容可能很尴尬，因为……
[00:07:24.290] you know, like inside my head, I'm like cringing at how I squeaked. Right. Oh my god. Actually, that is low key one of my biggest fears. Where you know, when you don't talk for a long time, your throat is just not warmed up. Yes.
[00:07:24.290] 你知道吗，我心里一直在想我刚才说话的声音有多尖锐，想想就觉得尴尬。对啊。我的天哪。其实，这算是我最害怕的事情之一。你知道，长时间不说话，嗓子就没热身。是的。
[00:07:40.850] So then I feel like you have to kind of clear your throat a little bit before you talk to prevent things like that. So then I just have this horrible habit of always clearing my throat
[00:07:40.850] 所以我觉得说话前最好先清清嗓子，免得出现那种情况。结果我就养成了这个坏习惯，总是清嗓子。
[00:07:49.650] constantly. And I'm just like, dude, I can't clear my throat more than I talk at work. Oh my god. Honestly, I think I'm similar. I like try to clear my throat. If there's even like
[00:07:49.650] 总是这样。我就想，老兄，我清嗓子的次数都比上班说话的次数多。我的天哪。说真的，我觉得我也差不多。我喜欢清嗓子。哪怕只是……
[00:08:00.530] anything I'm like, dude, it might be a squeak. It was just that this dude came and I was unprepared. So I you know, I didn't have time to clear my throat. He was already rounding the corner saying hey, and I was like,
[00:08:00.530] 我当时就想，哥们儿，可能只是轻微的吱吱声。只是这哥们儿突然来了，我一点儿准备都没有。所以你知道，我连清嗓子的时间都没有。他已经转过拐角跟我打招呼了，我当时就想，
[00:08:16.910] oh man. But I kind of made up for it because later, it was either the same day or maybe it was the next day. I saw him again in the hallway and this time I was prepared. I gave a like a nice,
[00:08:16.910] 哦，天哪。不过我后来算是弥补了，因为后来，可能是当天，也可能是第二天，我在走廊里又看到了他，这次我做好了准备。我友好地打了个招呼，
[00:08:30.590] well voiced out, hey. And he was like, hey, like a full bodied Hey. There were no squeaks the second time he heard me loud and clear. It was not an awkward eye contact anymore. It was like solid eye contact with smiles and nods all around.
[00:08:30.590] 他大声地回应道：“嘿。” 第二次他听到我的声音时，没有丝毫含糊不清。眼神交流也不再尴尬，而是充满自信，彼此微笑点头。
[00:08:52.030] Okay, it's like a usually I'm normal and here's proof kind of a hey. Exactly, exactly. That's the dilemma low key. Like when things like that happen, I'm like, should I acknowledge that
[00:08:52.030] 好吧，这就像“我通常都很正常，这是证据”那种感觉，嘿。没错，没错。这就是我内心深处的困境。就像当这种事情发生时，我会想，我应该承认吗？
[00:09:03.870] that was weird and be like, oh, I don't know what sound that was haha but hey, or should I just make the moment as short as possible and move along? Oh my god, that's a good question. Maybe next time I'll try acknowledging it. I'll be like,
[00:09:03.870] 那声音真奇怪，我可能会想，哦，我不知道那是什么声音，哈哈，不过，我应该赶紧结束这个尴尬的时刻，继续做其他事吗？我的天，这真是个好问题。也许下次我会试着回应一下。我会说，
[00:09:17.070] oh, I'm sorry, my voice is broken. Anyway, enough stewing in my awkward moment. I think we can move on to the topic at hand today. So I kind of wanted to talk about what makes a close friend. And I
[00:09:17.070] 哦，抱歉，我嗓子哑了。好了，别再纠结刚才的尴尬了。我想我们可以开始今天的主题了。我本来想聊聊什么才算是真正的朋友。
[00:09:38.930] guess like before we can truly dive into the topic, we have to consider what exactly is a close friend. In my mind, I think a close friend is someone who you trust a lot and you'll share with them
[00:09:38.930] 我想，在我们真正深入探讨这个话题之前，我们必须先弄清楚究竟什么是知己。在我看来，知己就是你非常信任并且愿意与他们分享一切的人。
[00:09:53.090] secrets, I guess or you know, just things that you wouldn't share normally with anyone on the street. I think that's a good definition. I think I honestly found it a little bit easier to define
[00:09:53.090] 我想，就是秘密，或者说，你知道，就是那些你通常不会跟街上任何人分享的事情。我觉得这个定义挺贴切的。说实话，我觉得这样定义起来更容易些。
[00:10:05.410] what a close friend was when I was younger. Because I feel like when you're young, close friends are sort of like people you just hang out with more and prefer more than other people like at school.
[00:10:05.410] 我年轻的时候，好朋友的定义是什么？因为我觉得，年轻的时候，好朋友就像是你在学校里更愿意和他们一起玩、更喜欢和他们相处的人，而不是和其他人相处。
[00:10:18.210] Right. But now that I'm older, and time is a little bit more of a limited resource, I feel like I can't really hold the term close friends by that definition anymore. Where it's not always
[00:10:18.210] 没错。但现在我年纪大了，时间也更有限了，我觉得我不能再用以前的定义来定义“亲密朋友”这个词了。它并不总是……
[00:10:30.770] like the people that I can afford to see the most. But it's something different. Like it's kind of hard to define now. That's true. I feel like also because it's very common, at least I think in the
[00:10:30.770] 就像我最常去看的那些人一样。但这又有所不同。现在很难定义它。确实如此。我觉得也因为它很常见，至少我认为在……
[00:10:45.250] Bay maybe to hang out in like large groups sometimes, or like friend groups, like maybe four to five people, something of that sort. And when that happens, things get shared. And you know,
[00:10:45.250] 贝伊可能有时候会和一大群人，或者像朋友小团体那样聚会，大概四五个人左右。在这种情况下，大家会分享一些东西。你知道，
[00:10:58.850] maybe a specific person might not be close to you, but they'll know because they were part of the group hangout. And by association, they know more about you. Yeah, I guess if I really had to try to
[00:10:58.850] 也许某个人跟你并不熟，但他们也会知道，因为他们也参加了那次聚会。通过这种联系，他们对你也更加了解了。嗯，我想如果我真的非要尝试的话……
[00:11:13.170] define how I see my close friends, I think it would be people who I kind of can't imagine not having in my life for the rest of my life. Like people that I value really dearly and I can
[00:11:13.170] 要定义我心目中的挚友，我想应该是那些我无法想象余生没有他们陪伴的人。就像那些我非常珍惜、可以依靠的人。
[00:11:28.530] envision us at like 80 years old being grandmas or like grandpas together in like a retirement home or something. Yeah, that's a nice image. I know it's kind of abstract. But then like
[00:11:28.530] 想象一下我们八十岁的时候，一起住在养老院里，成了爷爷奶奶或外公外婆。嗯，这画面挺美好的。我知道这有点抽象。但是……
[00:11:45.890] what makes them reach the point? Is it the frequency that you hang out with them? Or is it like a certain level of trust that you built up? Because I feel like there's also sometimes
[00:11:45.890] 是什么让他们达到那种程度？是你们相处的频率吗？还是你们之间建立起的某种信任？因为我觉得有时候也有其他因素。
[00:11:58.850] friends who you don't see as often, but they're still like a super trusted and like close friend. Yeah, that's a good point. I guess in my mind, if I was creating like a close friends litmus test,
[00:11:58.850] 那些不常见面，但依然非常值得信赖、关系很亲密的朋友。嗯，你说得对。我想，如果让我来设定一个判断朋友是否亲密的标准，
[00:12:13.410] maybe the easiest thing would be can me and this person hang out one-on-one and run errands all day? Maybe that's kind of the litmus test because I think if someone has really good vibes in general,
[00:12:13.410] 也许最简单的办法就是，我和这个人能不能单独出去玩一天，一起跑跑腿？这或许是个试金石，因为我觉得如果一个人整体感觉真的很好，
[00:12:27.570] even if you're not close friends, you could probably do like a big friend group hangout together or just hang out with them and things like that. But when it comes down to like the
[00:12:27.570] 即使你们不是特别亲密的朋友，你们也可以一起组织一次大型朋友聚会，或者只是和他们一起出去玩之类的。但说到真正意义上的……
[00:12:37.010] mundane stuff, can you and this person hang out all day and not get bored of each other? And maybe bored isn't really the right word, but can this person fit into your life like a puzzle piece when you guys are in the same area or something like that?
[00:12:37.010] 一些琐碎的事情，比如你和这个人能整天待在一起而不感到厌倦吗？或许“厌倦”这个词不太准确，但当你们身处同一区域时，这个人能像拼图一样融入你的生活吗？
[00:12:51.890] I like that because you're so right. Like some friends, they're just like peripheral almost, like not in a bad way, but they're just like not close to you. But like by association and stuff,
[00:12:51.890] 我喜欢你说的，因为你说得太对了。就像有些朋友，他们就像是边缘人物，倒不是说不好，只是感觉和你不太亲近。但通过一些关联之类的，
[00:13:02.370] they're there and like you've gained some sort of closeness, but maybe not to the point where it's like they're your inner circle. Right. And I think there is something to be said about what you mentioned earlier about can I share my deepest, darkest secrets with this person?
[00:13:02.370] 他们就在那里，你们之间似乎建立了某种亲密关系，但可能还没到那种亲密无间的程度。没错。而且我觉得你之前提到的“我能和这个人分享我最深最黑暗的秘密吗？”这个问题确实值得探讨。
[00:13:18.770] This might sound a little bit weird, but I feel like there's even tiers or categories to secrets. So there are things that you wouldn't post about on like Instagram, for example,
[00:13:18.770] 这听起来可能有点奇怪，但我感觉秘密甚至还有等级或类别之分。例如，有些事情你不会在Instagram之类的社交媒体上发布。
[00:13:29.170] but it could be like a juicy story that's like, you know, here, let me tell you a secret, but I actually don't care if word gets out. It's just more like a personal thing, but not necessarily
[00:13:29.170] 但也可能像个劲爆的故事，你知道，就像“来，我告诉你个秘密，但我其实不在乎消息走漏”。这更像是件私事，但也不一定非得如此。
[00:13:38.130] I have to guard this with my life. So those kinds of secrets, I could see myself sharing at like a friend group hangout where maybe some of my close friends are there, but other people I'm not
[00:13:38.130] 我必须像守护生命一样守护它。所以，这类秘密，我可能会在朋友聚会的时候分享，也许会有一些很要好的朋友在场，但也会有一些我不认识的人。
[00:13:47.810] as personally close with. But then there are those secrets that are like, I can count on one hand the number of people I've told this to, you know what I mean? Like something that's like actually deeply
[00:13:47.810] 就像是和自己非常亲近的人分享的秘密。但有些秘密，我一只手就能数过来告诉过多少人，你懂我的意思吗？就像一些非常私密的事情。
[00:13:58.530] embarrassing. And if this were to get out, I would be like KMS basically. I do agree. Like, can I trust this person enough to tell this secret or like maybe say these things that
[00:13:58.530] 太尴尬了。如果这件事传出去，我基本上就跟KMS一样了。我同意。比如，我能信任这个人到足以告诉他这个秘密，或者说这些话吗？
[00:14:10.290] I wouldn't feel comfortable saying in front of like other people that I'm not as close to. So there is kind of like a trust and like emotional balance requirement for close friends too. True. Oh my God, do you have almost like a test? Like if you feel like,
[00:14:10.290] 我不太愿意在不太亲近的人面前说这些。所以，即使是亲密的朋友，也需要一定的信任和情感平衡。没错。我的天，你是不是有个测试之类的？比如，如果你觉得……
[00:14:26.930] oh, I vibe really well with this person, maybe I'll share a secret and like see how it feels. It's like the first gate of friendship. Damn, I can't think of one specifically,
[00:14:26.930] 哦，我和这个人感觉特别合得来，也许我可以跟她分享个秘密，看看感觉怎么样。这就像是友谊的第一道关卡。哎，我一时想不出具体的例子。
[00:14:42.530] but I feel like I probably do have like some sort of checkpoint, you know? Like I think maybe for me, it's like, can we hang out one-on-one and I feel super comfortable around you? If we're hanging
[00:14:42.530] 但我感觉我可能确实有个某种判断标准，你知道吗？就像我觉得对我来说，就是，我们能单独相处吗？我能和你相处得非常自在吗？如果我们能一起出去玩的话。
[00:14:52.530] out and I'm laying down, then I'm probably really comfortable around you. But if I'm like sitting up straight and I'm not comfy, then maybe we're not that close. Like you're guards up. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:14:52.530] 如果我躺着，那说明我跟你在一起很自在。但如果我坐直了身子，却感觉不自在，那可能说明我们关系没那么亲密，你好像有所防备。嗯，嗯。
[00:15:03.330] I see. I see. Yeah. I'm just thinking, I think I also don't have like a specific secret necessarily, but there's definitely been moments and I've found this to be easier in situations where like
[00:15:03.330] 我明白了。我明白了。嗯。我只是在想，我觉得我也没有什么特别的秘密，但确实有些时候，我发现这种情况更容易解决，比如……
[00:15:16.450] one recent one that I can think of is like it was me and maybe like one or two other girls in like a bigger group of guys. And so me and the girl were like vibing more just cause like,
[00:15:16.450] 最近我能想到的一个例子是，当时我和一两个其他女生在一群男生中间。我和其中一个女生感觉比较合得来，因为……
[00:15:30.210] you know, we're like the only girls in this huge group of guys throughout the night. I feel like we're vibing well. And so I like slip in a little secret. I'm like, Ooh, don't tell anyone about
[00:15:30.210] 你知道，那天晚上我们好像是这群男生里唯一的女生。我觉得我们相处得很好。所以我就偷偷透露了个小秘密。我说：“哦，别告诉任何人……”
[00:15:39.890] this. But like I got some tea for you. I think I understand. Secrets are kind of a cheat code to furthering a friendship too into like a close friendship. Yeah. It actually kind of reminds me
[00:15:39.890] 就是这样。不过，我给你准备了点茶。我想我明白了。秘密就像是加深友谊，发展成亲密友谊的秘诀。是啊。这其实让我想起了……
[00:15:53.810] of our college friend group from freshman year. Do you remember that one night we were up really late passing around like a bottle and then we shared like our deepest darkest secrets. And then
[00:15:53.810] 还记得我们大学一年级时的朋友圈吗？那天晚上我们熬夜到很晚，像传酒一样传递着酒瓶，然后我们分享了彼此最深最黑暗的秘密。
[00:16:05.170] we stayed up till like five or 6am that night, I think. And I think that was one of the nights we were like, okay, we're like close friends now. Dude, yes. But the craziest part is I don't even
[00:16:05.170] 那天晚上我们大概熬到凌晨五六点才睡。我觉得那天晚上我们俩就感觉，好吧，我们现在是好朋友了。哥们儿，没错。但最不可思议的是，我甚至……
[00:16:14.850] remember any of the deepest darkest secrets. Like I don't remember what I shared. I don't think I remember what anyone shared. I remember like bits and pieces. I think most of it was just kind of
[00:16:14.850] 我不记得任何最深最黑暗的秘密。比如，我不记得我分享过什么。我想我也不记得任何人分享过什么。我只记得一些零碎的片段。我想大部分都只是模糊不清的记忆。
[00:16:24.130] like our childhood traumas or something. But I think you know, it's probably that idea of intimacy that is kind of established when you do share deeper secrets. And maybe it's not as much of
[00:16:24.130] 比如我们童年的创伤之类的。但我觉得，你知道，这可能跟分享更深层次的秘密有关，而这种分享能建立起一种亲密感。也许这并不完全是……
[00:16:39.890] like a test but kind of like a passageway right? Fun friends, people that you like hanging out with maybe stay at that level if you don't share some things that you hold pretty close to your heart.
[00:16:39.890] 就像一场考试，但又有点像一条通道，对吧？和有趣的朋友，你喜欢一起玩的人，如果你不和他们分享一些你内心深处珍藏的事情，你们的关系可能就止步于此。
[00:16:54.210] If fun friends can stay as fun friends, do you think close friends can fall back and become less close friends? Oh, that's a really interesting question because I would almost say that sometimes close friends aren't fun friends. Oh, so they're not fun to be around?
[00:16:54.210] 如果有趣的朋友能一直保持有趣的关系，你觉得亲密的朋友会不会变疏远，不再那么亲密了呢？哦，这真是一个有趣的问题，因为我几乎要说，有时候亲密的朋友并不有趣。哦，所以和他们在一起就不好玩吗？
[00:17:19.810] Okay, that is not what I mean. But maybe it's hard to revert back into the levity of fun friendships when you are at that close friends level. Once you have shared like your darker secrets or maybe
[00:17:19.810] 好吧，我不是那个意思。但也许当你和朋友关系亲密到那种程度时，就很难再回到以前那种轻松愉快的友谊状态了。一旦你分享了你比较隐秘的秘密，或者……
[00:17:33.490] are used to sharing very personal like small details of your life, then it is hard to revert back. And I think there is a certain pattern that comes with being a close friend to someone.
[00:17:33.490] 如果习惯于分享非常私人的生活细节，就很难再回到从前。我认为，和某人成为亲密朋友之间会形成某种特定的模式。
[00:17:46.450] Sometimes I think you pigeonhole that friendship into just close friendship where you only divulge like details and secrets and like tea and you forget to do fun stuff with each other. And that's something that's like a learning that I've been having in the last few years, especially
[00:17:46.450] 有时候我觉得你会把友谊局限在亲密友谊的范畴里，只分享一些细节、秘密，比如喝茶聊天，却忘记一起做些有趣的事情。这是我过去几年一直在学习的东西，尤其如此。
[00:18:03.330] post-COVID where I'm like, am I just doing the same thing over and over with these people that I value so deeply but I'm just so used to having this type of hangout with them, you know? Oh,
[00:18:03.330] 疫情后，我常常会想，我是不是一直在和这些我非常珍惜的人重复做同样的事情？但我已经习惯了和他们以这种方式聚会，你知道吗？哦。
[00:18:13.810] I see. I see. It's like I think I saw this TikTok that I actually sent to you as well where the narrator of the TikTok was like, oh, a lot of our adult friendships nowadays are like
[00:18:13.810] 我明白了。我明白了。就像我之前发给你的那个TikTok视频一样，视频里的旁白说，哦，现在很多成年人的友谊都像这样……
[00:18:26.610] we just hang out and storytell to each other and we aren't doing active activities as much. So it's like we're bonding over not shared experiences in a sense, which I think kind of
[00:18:26.610] 我们只是聚在一起，互相讲故事，很少进行剧烈的活动。所以某种程度上来说，我们之间的联系并非建立在共同经历之上，我觉得这挺……
[00:18:40.210] matches what you're saying. A lot of these close friends, we just end up sharing, you know, our stories with them like, oh my god, you'll never guess what happened. And then it's their turn.
[00:18:40.210] 跟你说的一样。很多时候，我们都会跟很要好的朋友分享我们的故事，比如，“我的天哪，你绝对猜不到发生了什么。” 然后就轮到他们了。
[00:18:47.970] They're like, dude, like guess what happened to me too? And then we like have these meaningful catch-up sessions, but like we're not creating new experiences as much kind of like you said.
[00:18:47.970] 他们会说，兄弟，猜猜我身上发生了什么？然后我们就会进行一些有意义的叙旧聚会，但就像你说的，我们并没有创造很多新的体验。
[00:19:01.970] Yeah, I really was struck by that TikTok you sent me and I think one of the symptoms that happens when you aren't exploring new experiences or creating new shared worlds for yourselves basically
[00:19:01.970] 是的，你发给我的那个TikTok视频真的让我印象深刻。我觉得，当你不再探索新体验或为自己创造新的共享世界时，就会出现这种情况。
[00:19:17.490] is, you know, I think a lot of hangouts you meet up and especially if it's like a long-term friendship, you kind of reminisce about the times where you did create new experiences with each
[00:19:17.490] 你知道，我觉得很多时候，尤其是和老朋友聚会的时候，大家会一起回忆过去一起创造新体验的时光。
[00:19:26.610] other all the time and you're like, oh, remember when this happened or remember when that happened? But you can only do that so many times before it's kind of like you're just talking about the same
[00:19:26.610] 你总是会想起其他人，然后你会想，哦，还记得这件事吗？或者记得那件事吗？但你只能这样做几次，之后就好像你在重复同样的事情一样。
[00:19:35.490] thing over and over. And part of me was kind of like, oh, that really sucks that this is a loop. I guess I just never thought about the alternative or like the solve for it until I saw that TikTok
[00:19:35.490] 这件事一遍又一遍地重复。我当时想，哦，这真是个糟糕的循环。直到我看到那个TikTok视频，我才开始思考其他的解决办法。
[00:19:47.810] because there is a way out from like the infinite loop that you're like stuck in sort of. I guess I just never thought about it that way of why don't you just go out and do things together
[00:19:47.810] 因为总有办法摆脱你现在陷入的那种无限循环。我猜我以前从来没这样想过，为什么你们不出去一起做点什么呢？
[00:19:56.610] and like create new memories? Okay, but I will say that I think we're not too bad about like creating new memories. I feel like we've done it decently a handful of times when I think of
[00:19:56.610] 创造新的回忆？好吧，不过我觉得我们在创造新的回忆方面还不错。我觉得我们已经成功地创造了一些不错的回忆。
[00:20:09.650] us specifically. We've gone on a few trips together with like a little small friend group. We've hung out in New York and stuff, but I feel like those are kind of big events. Like,
[00:20:09.650] 就我们俩而言。我们和一小群朋友一起旅行过几次。我们在纽约之类的地方玩过，但我觉得那些都算是比较大的事了。比如，
[00:20:22.210] you know, traveling to a whole new country, flying over all the way to the East Coast. They're like kind of more big events versus regularly occurring things. So I guess that's like where we can still
[00:20:22.210] 你知道，去一个全新的国家旅行，或者一路飞到东海岸。这些都算是大事，而不是日常琐事。所以我想，这就是我们仍然可以……的地方。
[00:20:34.610] improve. Yeah, I think that's definitely true. And I feel like once you do it and you and your friend or maybe you and your friend group are like used to this habit of, okay, this year we
[00:20:34.610] 进步。是的，我觉得这绝对没错。而且我觉得一旦你这么做了，你和你的朋友，或者你和你的朋友圈就习惯了这种做法，比如，好吧，今年我们
[00:20:44.850] have to have a trip or this year we're going to go do all these different things, then it becomes part of your routine actually. So then it's not so like, oh, we have to go out of our way to do
[00:20:44.850] 如果你觉得必须去旅行，或者今年要去体验各种各样的事情，那么这些就自然而然地成为你日常生活的一部分。这样一来，就不会觉得“哦，我们必须特意去做”了。
[00:20:55.410] this. It's like, yes, of course we're doing this because we always do this. I think the harder like portion of this maybe is when you and your friend are close not in a friend group or maybe
[00:20:55.410] 就是这样。感觉就像，是的，我们当然会这样做，因为我们一直都这样做。我觉得这件事比较难的部分可能是，当你和你的朋友关系很亲密，但不在一个朋友圈里，或者……
[00:21:07.810] like as you grow up, your shared hobbies and your shared interests and your priorities have kind of split off, then I feel like it's a little bit harder. But the term hard too is just like,
[00:21:07.810] 随着年龄增长，你们共同的爱好、兴趣和优先事项逐渐分道扬镳，我觉得这就有点难了。但“难”这个词本身也有点……
[00:21:20.450] it's really not that hard. It's just like you just push to do it and then you just do it. But in my brain, I've categorized it as hard for some reason. Yeah, I mean, okay, if you think about it
[00:21:20.450] 其实没那么难。你只要下定决心去做，然后就去做了。但不知为何，我脑子里一直把它归类为难事。嗯，我的意思是，好吧，如果你仔细想想……
[00:21:30.530] too though, I'm going to compare this to romantic relationships. So what I've kind of noticed is in the beginning of a romantic relationship when people are still being wooed, the dates are
[00:21:30.530] 不过，我还要把它和恋爱关系做个比较。我注意到，在恋爱关系的初期，当人们还在被追求的时候，约会往往是这样的：
[00:21:44.370] different because the dates are kind of like, oh, what are things we can do? And sometimes you get cheesy things to do, but it's still helpful to bring the relationship forward because it's
[00:21:44.370] 不一样的是，约会的方式有点像是在想，哦，我们可以做些什么？有时候你会想到一些俗套的事情，但这仍然有助于推进关系，因为它……
[00:21:59.170] stuff that you're doing. So an example is bowling. That's such a date thing. It totally is. People don't really bowl as friend groups super often, but I feel like it would be totally very
[00:21:59.170] 你在做的事情。比如保龄球。那简直就是约会的好选择。确实如此。人们不太经常和朋友们一起打保龄球，但我感觉那会非常……
[00:22:11.730] fun if people did. But I saw this funny meme that was like, bowling alleys are still alive because of first dates. Oh my God, that's so funny. That's actually so true though. I can't
[00:22:11.730] 如果大家都这么做就好了。但我看到一个搞笑的梗图，说保龄球馆之所以还能存在，是因为人们喜欢在那里约会。我的天哪，这也太搞笑了。不过说的也确实有道理。我简直……
[00:22:24.210] remember the last time I bowled. When you think about that, like beginning of the relationship, it's like activities. But then later as the relationship becomes more comfortable, more settled, then it becomes less of activities and it's more like, oh, let's grab dinner. Let's
[00:22:24.210] 还记得我上次打保龄球是什么时候吗？想想看，就像恋爱初期一样，会一起做各种活动。但随着感情日渐深厚、稳定下来，活动就减少了，取而代之的是，比如，哦，我们一起吃顿饭吧。
[00:22:41.890] get dessert. Let's stay in and watch TV. And there's nothing wrong with that, but it kind of reflects friendships in a way too. True. And I feel like even just changing the location or
[00:22:41.890] 吃甜点吧。咱们待在家里看电视。这没什么不好，但某种程度上也反映了友谊。没错。我觉得即使只是换个地方，或者
[00:22:56.370] something is also new enough to where it could be exciting. For example, if you and your friend group always goes to someone's house to sip wine and chat, maybe this time you go out to a wine bar
[00:22:56.370] 一些新鲜事物也足以令人兴奋。例如，如果你和朋友们总是去某人家里小酌聊天，那么这次或许可以去酒吧喝一杯。
[00:23:09.970] or if you guys like to go to someone's house and watch a movie, maybe you go out to the movie theater or a drive-in movie. The activity you could kind of hold, but maybe switch up the
[00:23:09.970] 或者，如果你们喜欢去别人家看电影，也许可以去电影院或露天汽车影院。你们可以继续这项活动，但也许可以换换花样。
[00:23:19.410] environment a little bit. And that way you're introducing something new without having to completely change the dynamic of what you and your friends are used to or enjoy doing. I guess the only problem then is, I don't know, maybe it's a Bay Area thing or a suburbs thing,
[00:23:19.410] 稍微改变一下环境。这样你就能在不彻底改变你和朋友们习惯或喜欢做的事情的情况下，引入一些新的东西。我想唯一的问题就是，我不知道，也许这是湾区或者郊区特有的现象。
[00:23:34.130] but I feel like a lot of these things that we do, like, oh, go to someone's house and drink there instead of going out to the bar, is either because of comfort because you're at someone's house and
[00:23:34.130] 但我感觉我们做的很多事情，比如去别人家喝酒而不是去酒吧，要么是因为在别人家感觉更舒服，要么是因为在别人家感觉更自在。
[00:23:43.650] there's comfortable couches and stuff, or sometimes it's because of money. And it just makes more sense to not pay $20 for a cocktail when you can spend some cheaper alcohol at someone's house.
[00:23:43.650] 家里有舒适的沙发之类的，有时候也可能是因为钱的问题。与其花20美元买一杯鸡尾酒，不如去别人家喝点便宜的酒，岂不是更划算？
[00:23:57.250] But yeah, I don't know. At this age of 27, I don't want to stop experiencing new things just because I'm like, oh, this is the easy thing or this is what we always do or this is cheaper. Agreed. Your solutions are really good ideas because sometimes you're like,
[00:23:57.250] 是啊，我也不知道。我今年27岁了，不想因为觉得“哦，这样做比较容易”、“我们一直都这么做”或者“这样做更便宜”就停止体验新鲜事物。没错。你的建议真的很好，因为有时候你会觉得，
[00:24:13.410] oh, it's also a lot of work to think of something that everyone will want to do. Not everyone wants to do it, but you're right, changing up the scenery or just
[00:24:13.410] 哦，要想出一件大家都想做的事也挺费劲的。不是每个人都想做，但你说得对，换换环境或者只是
[00:24:24.130] doing the same activity but in a different font almost. True. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. It's all very helpful ways to have more experiences with friends. And I think, kind of tying back to the original topic, these experiences help bring friendships
[00:24:24.130] 做着同样的事情，只是字体不同而已。没错。这么说很贴切。是的。这些都是增进与朋友相处经验的好方法。而且我觉得，回到最初的话题，这些经历有助于增进友谊。
[00:24:48.050] to become closer. Because I'm kind of also just thinking in my mind, the fact that, for an example, me, you, James and our friend, Aubie, we have gone on two international trips together now. And we just have a certain connection because of that that not all of
[00:24:48.050] 为了拉近彼此的距离。因为我心里也在想，比如说，我和你、詹姆斯还有我们的朋友奥比，我们已经一起出国旅行过两次了。正因为如此，我们之间才建立了一种特殊的联系，这种联系并非所有人都有。
[00:25:08.610] our close friends have with us. Right. And in some ways, I feel like it kind of expands how much your friendship can take or you're not testing it, but you're training it like a muscle. Because
[00:25:08.610] 我们亲密的朋友会陪伴着我们。没错。在某种程度上，我觉得这能拓展友谊的承受极限，或者说，你不是在考验它，而是在像锻炼肌肉一样锻炼它。因为
[00:25:24.290] having good vibes with someone in a two-hour hangout, easy. You just have fun together and it's like you're on for two hours and then you go home. But for a two-week trip, for example,
[00:25:24.290] 和某人轻松愉快地相处两个小时很容易。你们一起玩得很开心，就像两个小时的聚会，然后就各自回家了。但如果是两周的旅行，比如……
[00:25:35.330] it's not as easy. But you learn so much and you almost develop an equilibrium of, okay, this is how we hang out and have fun even when we're tired or even when we're stressed,
[00:25:35.330] 这并不容易。但你会学到很多东西，并且几乎会形成一种平衡，那就是，即使我们很累或者压力很大，我们也能这样相处，这样玩得开心。
[00:25:47.010] or this is how we decompress together, etc. So I think you almost have to train the friendship to withstand more tension maybe. And you're also polishing it at the same time like a trophy.
[00:25:47.010] 或者说，这是我们一起放松的方式等等。所以我认为，你几乎需要训练这段友谊，让它能够承受更大的压力。同时，你也在像打磨奖杯一样精心呵护它。
[00:26:00.290] Dude, so true. And I mean, I guess in some situations, it could make or break a friendship. That's true. Maybe you guys go traveling and then you're like, damn, actually, maybe we don't vibe.
[00:26:00.290] 兄弟，说得太对了。我的意思是，在某些情况下，这甚至可能决定一段友谊的成败。确实如此。比如你们一起旅行，然后你突然意识到，哎，其实我们可能不太合得来。
[00:26:18.770] Or maybe it just kind of makes a friendship step down in a way where you're like, oh, like this person I don't vibe as well with during long travels. So I just won't do that with them.
[00:26:18.770] 或者，这可能只是让一段友谊降级，你会想，哦，这个人我不太喜欢一起长途旅行。所以我就不和他们一起旅行了。
[00:26:30.770] Yeah, yeah, definitely. And I think there's probably like a benefit to that too. It's like you just understand this friendship's boundaries or like, you know when this friendship is the most optimal and things like that. So we kind of talked about how experiences help bring friendships
[00:26:30.770] 对，对，当然。而且我觉得这可能也有好处。就像你会更了解这段友谊的界限，或者说，你知道这段友谊在什么情况下最合适等等。所以我们聊了聊经历如何帮助建立友谊。
[00:26:49.570] closer. But we also mentioned how nowadays a lot of our friendships are actually missing those experiences that can elevate a friendship to the next level. So kind of thinking about that, do you think it's harder to find slash make close friends nowadays, like at our age?
[00:26:49.570] 更亲近。但我们也提到，如今很多友谊实际上都缺少那些能让友谊更进一步的经历。所以，仔细想想，你觉得现在，比如我们这个年纪，是不是更难找到/建立亲密的朋友了？
[00:27:09.410] I think this is actually a really interesting question. And I wonder if now we just know what we want or seek in friends. So then we are slightly pickier with what we want from friends.
[00:27:09.410] 我觉得这确实是个很有意思的问题。我在想，现在我们是不是更清楚自己想要什么样的朋友，所以才会对朋友的要求更高一些。
[00:27:24.530] Or maybe it's just that a lot of our life or like our needs are maybe fulfilled already. So then you no longer are like seeking for a void in your life or something. I don't know.
[00:27:24.530] 或许只是因为我们生活中的很多需求都已经得到了满足。所以你不再需要寻找生活中的空虚感之类的。我不知道。
[00:27:36.770] But I do kind of think it is harder to make good friends at this age. But I don't think it's impossible. And I think a lot of my really close friends now are people that I've known very long
[00:27:36.770] 但我确实觉得在这个年纪交到好朋友比较难。不过，我觉得并非不可能。而且，我现在很多非常要好的朋友都是我认识很久的人。
[00:27:49.170] term. But some of them are people that I've met more recently. And I think, you know, even if maybe the duration that I've known these people is shorter, like they're still of course meaningful
[00:27:49.170] 这段时间里，我认识的人很多。但其中一些是我最近才认识的。我觉得，即使我认识他们的时间可能比较短，但他们对我来说仍然意义非凡。
[00:27:59.490] and like very important people in my life. So I don't think it's impossible for sure. But it is just harder. I think you make a really good point about maybe we're not in search of
[00:27:59.490] 就像我生命中非常重要的人一样。所以我并不认为这完全不可能。只是更难而已。你说的很有道理，也许我们并不是在寻找……
[00:28:10.450] something to fill a void because it's kind of like, through these years that we've grown up, friend slots have been taken, you know, like filled. And so now that we're here, it's more possible that you have like more friend slots filled than not filled.
[00:28:10.450] 填补空白需要一些东西，因为就像在我们成长的这些年里，朋友的位置都被占满了。所以现在我们到了这里，你的朋友位置被占满的可能性比未被占满的可能性更大。
[00:28:29.570] Having gone through like school, college, maybe even like grad school and like early career. So I think that makes total sense. It's just like a lot of the things that you're seeking have already been fulfilled slash are being fulfilled. And I guess to kind of tie it back
[00:28:29.570] 经历过学校、大学，甚至研究生院，以及早期职业生涯，我觉得这完全说得通。就像你所追求的很多东西都已经实现或正在实现一样。我想，这可以作为总结。
[00:28:48.290] to an earlier episode we had, having a significant other I think also plays a part in this where we're kind of getting to the age where a lot of people have started to settle into more serious
[00:28:48.290] 回到我们之前的节目，我觉得有伴侣也是造成这种情况的原因之一，因为我们都到了很多人开始安定下来，进入更稳定、更认真的恋爱关系的年纪了。
[00:29:02.450] relationships if they are in relationships. So then because of it being like pretty serious and long term usually, you know, their significant other is like basically their closest friend of all. So that takes up like a big space as well. And I guess like,
[00:29:02.450] 如果他们有伴侣的话。因为这段关系通常都很认真、很长久，所以他们的另一半基本上就是他们最亲密的朋友。因此，这也占据了他们生活中很大的空间。我想，
[00:29:20.450] I'm just thinking in my mind too, realistically, it's kind of hard to have a ton of close friends. It's a lot of people to keep up with. And it's a lot of like time and energy as well.
[00:29:20.450] 我心里也在想，说实话，要有很多知心朋友其实挺难的。要跟那么多人保持联系，很费时间和精力。
[00:29:31.010] Yeah, I think it definitely is a really hard balancing act because it's not just friends that you're kind of maintaining in your life. Like now you have work and you also might have
[00:29:31.010] 是的，我觉得这确实很难平衡，因为你不仅要维系朋友关系，还要兼顾工作和其他关系。
[00:29:42.050] kids later and you have your living situation and your family and like all these different factors have to be fit into a very specific schedule. So then I feel like a lot of our 20s, at least for me
[00:29:42.050] 以后有了孩子，有了住处，有了家庭，所有这些因素都必须安排进一个非常具体的日程里。所以我觉得，至少对我来说，我们20多岁的大部分时间都是这样度过的。
[00:29:56.050] has been like, how do I make the schedule work so that I don't feel super busy, but I'm also not just like stagnant and not doing anything at home. After you finish honing that schedule, if you
[00:29:56.050] 我一直在想，怎样安排时间才能既不让自己感觉特别忙，又不会在家无所事事，感觉很无聊。当你最终完善好这个日程安排之后，如果你
[00:30:08.450] meet someone new, then fitting them into like your already like jam-packed schedule, I feel like is another challenge. So then maybe that's another thing too, it's like timing, you know, like the
[00:30:08.450] 认识新朋友，然后把他们安排进你已经排得满满当当的日程里，我觉得这又是另一个挑战。所以，也许这也是个问题，就是时机，你知道，就像……
[00:30:20.370] timing of meeting someone cool or like valuable in your life. Like it's, I think a big factor too. Yeah, there's only 24 hours in a day. And like a lot of that is just sleep and work actually and like eating.
[00:30:20.370] 遇到某个很棒的人，或者对你人生很重要的人的时机，我觉得也是一个很重要的因素。毕竟一天只有24小时，而且大部分时间都花在睡觉、工作和吃饭上了。
[00:30:36.450] Yeah, and like nowadays at this age, usually the most common way that people meet each other is at work now. You know, it's up to you, like if you want to turn a work friend into a close friend,
[00:30:36.450] 是啊，现在这个年纪，人们最常见的相识方式就是在工作中。你知道，这完全取决于你，比如你想不想把工作上的朋友发展成好朋友。
[00:30:47.410] sometimes it's harder than you think, sometimes it's easier than you think. So there's a lot of varied experiences there versus I think in school, it's a little easier than work because like age range is more similar, you usually have some sort of common interest, like I don't know,
[00:30:47.410] 有时候比你想象的要难，有时候比你想象的要容易。所以那里有很多不同的经历，我觉得在学校里会轻松一些，工作上可能更容易一些，因为年龄范围更接近，你们通常会有一些共同的兴趣，比如，我不知道，
[00:31:07.650] your major or something. And like at work, it's just there's like more varied factors. Definitely. And also like people quit their jobs and you're just like, oh, I no longer see you every
[00:31:07.650] 比如你的专业之类的。还有工作方面，影响因素就更多了。确实如此。而且有些人辞职了，你就会想，哦，以后再也见不到你了。
[00:31:19.970] day. I think I mentioned it in an earlier episode, but that used to like strike me to the core where I was like, how could you leave this company? But now I'm like, okay, it's not personal anymore.
[00:31:19.970] 那天。我想我之前在某一集里提到过，以前这件事真的让我很受打击，我会想，你怎么能离开这家公司呢？但现在我想，好吧，这已经不是针对你个人的了。
[00:31:31.570] Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking about it right now. And I actually don't think I've made like a really close friend recently. Sorry, that sounds like so fucked up. But I mean, like, there hasn't been
[00:31:31.570] 是啊，是啊。我现在就在想这件事。而且我最近好像没交到什么特别要好的朋友。抱歉，这话听起来有点儿糟糕。但我的意思是，真的没有……
[00:31:46.610] someone where I met where our friendship just like elevated so quickly to the point that they're on par with like my previously really close friends. But what has happened is post college, there have
[00:31:46.610] 我认识的一个人，我们的友谊发展得非常迅速，很快就达到了和我以前非常亲密的朋友一样的程度。但是大学毕业后，情况发生了变化……
[00:31:59.730] been some friends who maybe like during college, we weren't at a really high level, but we were at a pretty decent level. And then since graduating and being adults now, they've elevated slowly over
[00:31:59.730] 有些朋友，比如大学时期，我们的水平虽然不算很高，但也还不错。毕业后，他们长大成人，水平也慢慢提高了。
[00:32:12.770] the years. Well, yeah, I feel like I had a really similar experience as well. And I feel like those are always really cool to kind of experience because to me, it kind of feels like you planted
[00:32:12.770] 这些年。嗯，是的，我觉得我的经历也和你非常相似。我觉得这些经历总是很酷的，因为对我来说，这感觉就像你种下了……
[00:32:25.090] something in your backyard, like a long time ago, never looked at it. And then you look back and you're like, this like a huge tree now. And it's kind of cool, because it has the benefits of a new
[00:32:25.090] 你后院里的东西，很久以前，你从没注意过它。然后你回头一看，发现它现在长成了一棵参天大树。这感觉很棒，因为它拥有了新事物带来的好处。
[00:32:36.050] friendship. But it also has the benefits of a legacy friendship, because you just know each other for so long. So those kinds of friendships, I feel like are the sleeper ones. And maybe that's actually the cool part about these interpersonal relationships, where maybe when you first meet
[00:32:36.050] 友谊。但它也具有传承友谊的优势，因为你们彼此认识很久了。所以我觉得这种友谊才是真正被埋没的。也许这才是人际关系最酷的地方，也许当你第一次见面时……
[00:32:52.530] your lifestyles weren't compatible, or just that timing wasn't the right one for you guys. But who knows, maybe down the line, your lives could open up to each other. And then you could become close
[00:32:52.530] 你们的生活方式不合，或者只是时机不对。但谁知道呢，也许将来你们的生活会彼此交融，到那时，你们或许会变得很亲密。
[00:33:03.810] friends. I think it is also possible that like, you know how we're talking about right now, we don't have quote unquote new close friends, but maybe like five years down the road, someone who
[00:33:03.810] 朋友。我觉得也有可能，就像我们现在说的，我们可能没有所谓的“新密友”，但也许五年后，会遇到某个人……
[00:33:15.490] we consider pretty normal friend right now becomes a close friend, because it just like it takes the time for that to happen. And for their friendship to like level up and reach that. Right, definitely.
[00:33:15.490] 我们现在觉得普通朋友变成亲密朋友，需要时间慢慢积累。他们的友谊需要时间提升，才能达到那种程度。没错，绝对是这样。
[00:33:31.250] So I have a question for you. And this is kind of related, I guess, to the balancing act of close friends. I think it's fairly common for people to have multiple close friends and not just one.
[00:33:31.250] 我有个问题想问你。我觉得这跟如何平衡亲密朋友之间的关系有点关系。我认为人们拥有多个亲密朋友而不是只有一个是很常见的。
[00:33:45.330] Something that I used to struggle with when I was younger, was trying to kind of see if I was playing favorites with these close friends. It kind of sounds stupid. But what I mean is like,
[00:33:45.330] 我年轻的时候一直很纠结的一件事，就是我有没有偏袒某个好朋友。这听起来可能有点傻。但我的意思是，
[00:33:58.130] I would say, okay, all these people are my close friends. So then if I tell my secret to this one friend, am I saying that all these other friends aren't my close friends, because I didn't tell
[00:33:58.130] 我会想，好吧，这些人都是我的好朋友。那么，如果我把我的秘密告诉了其中一个朋友，是不是就意味着其他所有朋友都不是我的好朋友了，因为我没有告诉他们我的秘密？
[00:34:09.330] them the secret. So then I would feel this obligation to keep up and like tell every single close friend every single secret. And then eventually I was kind of like this is not
[00:34:09.330] 把秘密告诉他们。所以我就觉得有义务继续保密，把每个秘密都告诉每一个亲密的朋友。最后我感觉这样下去不行。
[00:34:17.810] sustainable. And I think it also doesn't make sense where I would have like a meeting agenda going into a hangout with a close friend. But you know, do you feel or have you ever felt these kinds
[00:34:17.810] 可持续性。而且我觉得，和好朋友出去玩之前还要准备会议议程，这也很没道理。你知道，你有没有过这种感觉，或者曾经有过这种感觉？
[00:34:29.490] of pressures where maybe you're comparing your friendship with one close friend to the friendship with a different close friend? Okay, I'm gonna make a callback all the way to episode one.
[00:34:29.490] 压力可能来自于将你和一位挚友的友谊与另一位挚友的友谊进行比较？好的，我要回顾一下第一集的内容。
[00:34:45.890] So we had our friend Tiffany on for that episode. And there was a part in that episode where we were talking about friends and our different friendships. And one particular thing that we talked
[00:34:45.890] 所以那期节目我们请来了朋友蒂芙尼。节目里有一部分内容是关于朋友以及我们之间不同的友谊。我们特别谈到了一件事。
[00:34:57.090] about was that sometimes friends just fit in different areas of your life. I'm kind of thinking of that like immediately when you mentioned the different close friends. Like, you know, one close friend is really good for ranting about work with and the other close friend is
[00:34:57.090] 我的意思是，有时候朋友在你生活中扮演的角色并不相同。你一提到不同的挚友，我就立刻想到了这一点。比如，你知道，一个挚友很适合倾诉工作上的烦恼，而另一个挚友则……
[00:35:17.970] really good for, I don't know, like talking about food or, you know, kind of like that. So I think in one way a lot of these close friends kind of fit like that. It's like this one we vibe doing
[00:35:17.970] 真的很适合，比如说，聊聊食物之类的。所以我觉得从某种程度上来说，很多好朋友都挺适合这种类型的。就像我们一起做这件事一样，感觉很合拍。
[00:35:31.410] these things, that one we vibe doing those things. But yeah, I think there is maybe sometimes a little bit where you're like, oh, this is a close friend of mine. Like, I should probably share this with
[00:35:31.410] 这些事，我们做这些事的时候感觉很合拍。但是，我觉得有时候可能会有点儿，你会想，哦，这是我的好朋友。比如，我应该跟他/她分享这件事。
[00:35:42.050] them too. But I think like maybe it doesn't feel too much like that. At least for me. I don't think I've gotten to anything like that. I don't think I think about that too much. And if the moment
[00:35:42.050] 他们也是。但我认为也许感觉没那么强烈。至少对我来说是这样。我觉得我还没到那种程度。我不太会去想这个问题。如果那一刻……
[00:35:58.450] arises, if an opportunity arises where I'm like, oh yeah, like I can share with them this like particular information, I'll usually just hop on it. Yeah, that's probably like the healthier way of looking at it honestly. And I'm someone who struggles a little bit with insecurity and I
[00:35:58.450] 如果出现机会，让我觉得“哦，对了，我可以跟他们分享一些特定的信息”，我通常都会抓住机会。是的，老实说，这可能是更健康的看法。我这个人有点缺乏安全感，而且
[00:36:21.010] think that makes me overthink situations a little bit. But I think one of the situations that I fear a little bit, or this has happened to me too on the flip side, but sometimes I just feel
[00:36:21.010] 我觉得这让我有点想太多了。但我觉得我有点害怕的情况之一，或者说反过来我也遇到过这种情况，但有时候我只是感觉
[00:36:35.010] that if I don't tell one close friend a secret, or maybe not so much a secret, but let's say like a life update for example, right? If I have only told three of my close friends this one life update
[00:36:35.010] 如果我不跟一个好朋友分享一个秘密，或者说，与其说是秘密，不如说是生活近况之类的，那会怎么样？如果我只跟三个好朋友分享了这个近况呢？
[00:36:48.050] and then the other three close friends I haven't gotten a chance to tell yet, or maybe we just haven't hung out in a while or something like that. But then my close friends kind of
[00:36:48.050] 还有另外三个好朋友，我还没来得及跟他们说，或许是因为我们好久没见面了之类的。不过，我的好朋友们都挺……
[00:36:57.170] intermingle and hang out. I would hate for one of my close friends to hear news about me or maybe even a secret about me if they're also close friends. Like I would hate for them to hear that
[00:36:57.170] 互相交流、一起玩。我不想让我的好朋友听到关于我的消息，或者甚至是我的秘密，如果他们也是我的好朋友的话。比如，我不想让他们听到……
[00:37:08.850] through the other person. And I think sometimes this kind of overthinking or balancing makes me feel really weird and feel a sense of obligation and responsibility where maybe I shouldn't. Because like you said, sometimes you just don't get to it or maybe you just haven't
[00:37:08.850] 通过对方。我觉得有时候这种过度思考或权衡取舍会让我感觉很奇怪，让我感到一种不应该有的义务和责任感。因为就像你说的，有时候你就是没时间去做，或者你只是还没来得及。
[00:37:25.970] crossed paths with your close friend in a while. But because I've been on the side where someone has said, oh, you didn't hear this person blah, blah, blah. And I was like, oh shit,
[00:37:25.970] 好久没和你的好朋友碰面了。但我以前也遇到过这种情况：有人会说，“哦，你没听到这个人说的那些话……”然后我就想，“糟了……”
[00:37:35.170] I thought we were close friends, but maybe not is like the second part of that one. It should really just be like, oh, but we haven't caught up in a while. But the brain instantly goes to maybe
[00:37:35.170] 我以为我们是好朋友，但也许不是，这就像这句话的后半部分。它本来应该是这样的：哦，我们好久没联系了。但大脑却立刻想到“也许”。
[00:37:44.530] not. So I think I just have fear about trying to prevent these situations. Okay, honestly, that's totally fair. Because when you bring that up, I'm like, oh shit, no, that's right. I've definitely felt that too before. You're like, oh shit, I guess I haven't
[00:37:44.530] 不是。所以我想我只是害怕去阻止这些情况的发生。好吧，说实话，这完全可以理解。因为你一提起来，我就想，哦，天哪，没错。我以前肯定也有过这种感觉。你会想，哦，天哪，看来我还没……
[00:38:02.370] seen this person in a while. I need to catch up with them because I didn't hear about this. I think also, you in particular have a lot of close friends who know each other because you've
[00:38:02.370] 好久没见到这个人了。我得跟他/她聊聊，因为我之前没听说过这件事。我觉得，你有很多关系很铁的朋友，他们彼此都认识，因为你……
[00:38:15.250] mingled friend groups a decent amount. There's kind of that aspect to it as well. I think I'm kind of lucky enough where I have a bit of a centralized close friend group, which is like
[00:38:15.250] 和不同朋友圈子的人交往也挺多的。这方面也有关系。我觉得自己挺幸运的，我有一个比较集中、关系很亲密的朋友圈，就像……
[00:38:27.890] my high school friends and I can just share an announcement or a life update in there. So it reduces some of that. Oh, didn't you hear about this? If they didn't hear, it's their own fault because they didn't read the group message kind of.
[00:38:27.890] 我和我的高中朋友们可以在群里分享一些消息或者近况，这样就避免了一些不必要的麻烦。比如，“哦，你没听说这件事吗？”如果他们没听说，那也是他们自己的问题，因为他们没有看群里的消息。
[00:38:44.370] And I think my friend groups don't overlap a ton. So I by design don't need to worry about it as much. But you by design are a little more prone to having that worry, I think. Which is totally understandable. Yeah, that's a good point. And actually,
[00:38:44.370] 我觉得我的朋友圈重叠不多。所以从某种程度上来说，我不需要太担心这个问题。但我觉得你更容易有这种顾虑。这完全可以理解。嗯，你说得对。实际上，
[00:39:06.770] now that I think about it, if I was more on social media, maybe this would solve the issue. If I had a job update or a life update and I just announced it on Instagram or something,
[00:39:06.770] 现在想想，如果我多用社交媒体，也许就能解决这个问题了。如果我的工作或生活有什么新进展，我就在Instagram之类的平台上发布一下。
[00:39:17.970] a lot of people do, then maybe it would be less so like, okay, I have to tell these people so that they don't run into this situation or whatever. And that's not to say that I'm good
[00:39:17.970] 如果很多人都这么做，那可能就不会那么想了，比如“好吧，我必须告诉这些人，以免他们遇到这种情况”之类的。但这并不是说我做得好。
[00:39:27.810] at this kind of upkeep. I think because I fear it and I get anxiety about it, I like, don't commit to the solution. And I just continue to fear it, which is horrible. But
[00:39:27.810] 这种维护费用让我很头疼。我想是因为我害怕，也为此焦虑，所以我才不敢下决心去解决问题。我只是继续害怕，这太糟糕了。
[00:39:41.170] it's probably is like somewhat of a specific situation. Yeah. But I do also feel like there have been times where I'm like, I guess slowly updating the different friends slash friend groups of a certain life update. And I'm just like telling the same story over like
[00:39:41.170] 这可能有点像某种特定情况。是的。但我也觉得有时候，我会慢慢地向不同的朋友/朋友圈更新一些生活近况。然后我就一直在重复讲述同一个故事。
[00:40:00.130] five or six times. And I'm like, dude, I have this story like memorize like I can write a book. Oh my god, I know exactly what you mean. You're like at this point, it's so developed. There's like a beginning, a middle and an end.
[00:40:00.130] 五六遍了。然后我就想，老兄，我把这个故事背得跟能写本书似的。我的天，我完全明白你的意思。你现在感觉故事已经很完整了，有开头、中间和结尾。
[00:40:18.050] Like this is when everyone should laugh and I'll like pause so that you can laugh. Exactly. So I think that can also be pretty repetitive for sure. So one question as we continue to talk about, I guess these insecurities and friendships.
[00:40:18.050] 就像这时候大家都应该笑，我会停顿一下，让大家笑一笑。没错。所以我觉得这确实很容易重复。那么，在我们继续讨论这些不安全感和友谊的时候，还有一个问题。
[00:40:33.010] Have you ever been in a situation where you met someone and you were like, oh my god, I feel like this could be a potential close friend, but you felt insecure about, I guess moving it on to the next level?
[00:40:33.010] 你有没有过这样的经历：遇到某个人，你觉得“天哪，我觉得这个人有可能成为我的好朋友”，但你又不太有安全感，不知道该如何更进一步？
[00:40:48.050] I think yes. I can't think of anything like too specific off the top of my head right now. But for sure, I think that is a very common thing. And then I think there is like the common
[00:40:48.050] 我想是的。我现在一时想不出什么特别具体的例子。但可以肯定的是，我认为这很常见。然后我认为还有一种常见的现象。
[00:41:02.290] occurrence after that is like you come up with excuses in your head. You're like, oh, maybe I should hit this person up. You're like, no, but like, they live far like they're an SF and
[00:41:02.290] 之后的情况就像你在脑子里编造各种借口。你会想，哦，也许我应该联系一下这个人。你会想，不，但是，他们住得那么远，好像是旧金山人似的。
[00:41:12.770] I'm like in South Bay. So it doesn't make sense to hang out or like, oh no, they're probably busy. They have so many other friends. Like why would they want to hang out with me? That kind of stuff.
[00:41:12.770] 我住在南湾，所以跟他们出去玩没什么意义，或者会想，哦不，他们可能很忙，他们有那么多其他朋友，为什么要跟我出去玩呢？诸如此类的想法。
[00:41:24.130] Okay. I have a stupid example. So at work there's this person that I like really vibed with at a work event and we like had dinner a bunch of the evenings and like chatted and we just like really
[00:41:24.130] 好吧，我举个不太恰当的例子。在工作中，我遇到一个很喜欢的人，在一次公司活动上我们很合得来，之后我们经常一起吃饭聊天，感觉特别投缘。
[00:41:40.290] bonded and like vibed. But then the work event ended and we all returned to our normal lives. And in my mind, I was like, I don't know what to say to her. How do I continue this friendship?
[00:41:40.290] 我们相处融洽，感觉很合拍。但工作活动结束后，我们都回到了各自的生活。我当时心里想的是，我不知道该怎么跟她说。我该如何继续这段友谊呢？
[00:41:52.130] You know? So we just like didn't talk for a while until we like saw each other again at work, which was like many months later. But then like when you see each other, it's like good vibes all around
[00:41:52.130] 你知道吗？所以我们有好一阵子没联系，直到几个月后在工作中再次相遇。但见面之后，感觉一切都很融洽。
[00:42:03.570] still. I think like there's no fault for not hitting each other up because it's still like a very fresh friendship. But it's just like in that moment when you see each other and you're like
[00:42:03.570] 还是觉得。我觉得不主动联系也没什么错，毕竟友谊还很新。但就像那种感觉，当你见到对方时，你会想：
[00:42:14.210] still vibing while you're like, oh damn, like why was I worried at all? But then later once again we return to our normal lives and like the thoughts come back. Dude, this is like a romantic movie or something. I feel like I've definitely seen a movie with this
[00:42:14.210] 还在享受当下，同时又会想，哎呀，我之前到底在担心什么？但过一段时间，我们又回到了正常生活，那些念头又会涌上心头。老兄，这简直就像一部浪漫电影。我感觉我肯定看过一部类似的电影。
[00:42:29.170] kind of plot. Yeah, this is actually me just trying to make one friend at work. It's so complicated, right? But I know exactly what you mean. And I think you hit the nail on the head when you say
[00:42:29.170] 有点像剧情。是啊，其实我只是想在工作中交个朋友。是不是很复杂？但我完全明白你的意思。我觉得你说的很对。
[00:42:43.490] your brain just starts to make all these excuses on why you shouldn't hit this person up or maybe why it wouldn't work out not to make it relationship-y again. But I've had such similar
[00:42:43.490] 你的大脑会开始编造各种借口，告诉你为什么不应该联系这个人，或者为什么不继续发展成恋爱关系行不通。但我也有过类似的经历。
[00:42:54.450] things where my brain jumps and then I'm just like, oh this person is so cool, so cool. And then the moment kind of slips away. And I think one of the fears too is like yes, this one time we
[00:42:54.450] 有些时候，我的大脑会突然跳转，然后我就想，哦，这个人真酷，真酷。但那一刻却转瞬即逝。我觉得其中一个恐惧就是，是的，这一次我们
[00:43:06.770] hung out or maybe in this one specific environment we always vibe. But what happens when I take us out of that specific environment and do something more personal or maybe intermingle you with my
[00:43:06.770] 我们以前经常一起出去玩，或者在某个特定的环境下，我们总是感觉很合拍。但如果我带你离开那个特定的环境，去做一些更私人的事情，或者让你融入我的生活中，会发生什么呢？
[00:43:18.610] other friends or like all these different factors where I'm like, is it just better if we keep this friendship like this? And then that in turn just cages it again, right? So yeah. I think it's also
[00:43:18.610] 其他朋友，或者诸如此类的各种因素，都会让我思考，我们是不是最好还是维持这种友谊？但这样一来，反过来又会把它束缚住，对吧？所以，是的。我觉得这也是原因之一。
[00:43:31.330] scary because it's like, oh god, if we just hang out what if it goes wrong? Like what do I do? What do we talk about? So many worries. Exactly. Like what if I'm awkward? The awkward thing specifically
[00:43:31.330] 好可怕，因为感觉就像，天哪，如果我们只是出去玩，万一出了什么岔子怎么办？我该怎么办？我们聊什么？好多顾虑。没错。万一我表现得很尴尬怎么办？尤其是那种尴尬的感觉。
[00:43:47.090] too has gotten worse for me post-COVID where I'm just like, I don't know how to interact with people anymore. And even when I do interact with people and it goes okay, I'm like in some ways I'm so used
[00:43:47.090] 疫情后我的情况也变得更糟了，我感觉自己完全不知道该如何与人交往了。即使偶尔和人互动，气氛也还不错，但我总觉得，在某种程度上，我已经习惯了这种社交方式。
[00:44:01.250] to just being at home now. That's like my real life and then the outside world is like me going on a business trip, you know? Wait that's such a good way of putting it. You're like, all right we're
[00:44:01.250] 现在就待在家里，这才是我的真实生活，而外面的世界就像我出差一样，你知道吗？等等，你这么说真贴切。你会想，好吧，我们
[00:44:12.210] going out into the world, gotta put my game face on, put on real clothes. Dude. Exactly. I literally in the beginning of the episode I mentioned how we go into the office sometimes now and I was
[00:44:12.210] 出门在外，得打起精神，穿上正式的衣服。兄弟，没错。我在这集开头就提到过我们现在有时候会去办公室，然后我就……
[00:44:27.170] like looking through my closet, I was like what do I wear? I just have a bunch of loungewear from COVID. Like all the expensive stuff in your closet now is like pajamas. I was like oh my god, where did my work clothes go?
[00:44:27.170] 就像我翻看衣柜一样，我心想我该穿什么呢？里面全是疫情期间买的家居服。感觉衣柜里那些昂贵的衣服现在都跟睡衣差不多了。我当时就想，天哪，我的工作服都去哪儿了？
[00:44:44.690] Oh my god yeah. And don't even get me started about putting on work professional or like heels or you know nice boots and stuff. I was like these are just cages for my feet.
[00:44:44.690] 我的天哪，真的。还有，别跟我提穿工作服、高跟鞋或者漂亮的靴子之类的。我当时就觉得，这些鞋子简直就是脚的笼子。
[00:44:55.410] How did I used to wear them every day to work? Yeah and sometimes I'm like is this even appropriate? Like I feel so different in them, like who am I? But yeah I definitely feel that. I guess the
[00:44:55.410] 我以前怎么能每天都穿着它们去上班呢？是啊，有时候我会想，这样合适吗？感觉穿上它们之后自己都变了个人，我到底是谁？不过，我确实有这种感觉。我想……
[00:45:07.730] pandemic technically ended a year ago-ish but it still feels like we're ramping up from it in some ways. I guess like the thought is the pandemic's over so like tomorrow we'll be back to our quote-unquote normal selves pre-pandemic but that is like completely wrong. Like the
[00:45:07.730] 疫情从技术上讲已经结束大约一年了，但感觉我们仍然在某些方面处于疫情后的状态。我想，人们可能会觉得疫情结束了，明天我们就能恢复到疫情前的所谓“正常”生活，但这完全是错误的。
[00:45:28.610] pandemic was at least two years right? So that's like habits formed, changes cemented I guess. So it will take time for us to like revert back and I think we forget that sometimes.
[00:45:28.610] 疫情至少持续了两年，对吧？所以很多习惯都养成了，很多改变也根深蒂固了。因此，我们需要时间才能恢复到以前的状态，而我们有时会忘记这一点。
[00:45:42.210] Like even I forgot about it until actually I was talking with my therapist about it and she was like dude that's something we forget that there's ramp up time. That's why you're so awkward in the
[00:45:42.210] 就连我自己都忘了这回事，直到我和我的心理咨询师聊起这件事，她才说：“兄弟，我们常常忘记这一点，人需要一段时间来适应。” 这就是为什么你在社交场合会那么尴尬。
[00:45:52.290] office, me crying on the couch. Yeah that's true and I think definitely social skills for sure like you said but also the lifestyle habits as you mentioned. I was talking to my boss and he was
[00:45:52.290] 办公室里，我却在沙发上哭。是啊，确实如此，我觉得社交技巧肯定很重要，就像你说的，但生活习惯也很重要，就像你提到的那样。我和老板聊天的时候，他……
[00:46:05.010] like oh yeah I used to always go to this place after work with my coworkers and we would hang out here. Nowadays I feel like after work I just want to beeline at home and maybe it's the generational
[00:46:05.010] 哦，对啊，我以前经常下班后和同事们来这里，我们会在这儿聊天。现在我感觉下班后只想直奔家，也许是代沟吧。
[00:46:18.530] difference but I also feel like because of COVID people want to go home you know? Like they default to going home and being home and I'm not as used to having like post-workday weeknight plans anymore
[00:46:18.530] 虽然有所不同，但我也觉得因为疫情，人们更想回家，你知道吗？他们好像默认就回家待在家里，而我已经不太习惯下班后晚上有安排了。
[00:46:31.410] but I do feel like pre-pandemic that was totally a thing. Yeah you're so right nowadays I'm like damn if I'm not home by 5 p.m like it's a bad day but like back in the day pre-pandemic
[00:46:31.410] 但我觉得在疫情之前，这确实是常态。是啊，你说得太对了，现在我如果下午五点前没到家，就好像今天糟透了一样，但疫情之前可不是这样。
[00:46:46.450] sometimes I'd get home at like 7 or 8 and I was like this is normal. Yeah and I feel this now too where it's like you know when you're trying to make plans with someone and you look at your calendars
[00:46:46.450] 有时候我七八点到家，心想这很正常。是啊，我现在也有这种感觉，就像你想和别人约好，然后看看你们的日历……
[00:46:57.410] and you guys both are only free on like a weeknight I feel like it's like oh I'm sorry like maybe only Wednesday works does that work for you? It's like almost an apologetic tone whereas before it's like
[00:46:57.410] 你们俩好像只有工作日晚上有空，感觉就像在说“哦，不好意思，可能只有周三可以，可以吗？”语气有点歉意，而以前是这样的。
[00:47:07.730] well yeah let's do dinner and drinks on Wednesday but now I just can't even imagine it being that casual. Oh that's true that's such a good point like oh after work let's just go grab dinner and
[00:47:07.730] 嗯，是啊，我们周三一起吃晚饭喝点东西吧，但我现在完全想象不出这么随意的场景了。哦，你说得对，这真是个好主意，比如，哦，下班后我们一起去吃个晚饭吧，
[00:47:19.090] it's like yeah totally now it's like uh I'm trying to go home. Like on a school night? No thank you. Exactly. I guess like after all of our discussing and reflecting I think close friends are definitely
[00:47:19.090] 是啊，完全是这样，现在我只想回家。可是上学日的晚上？不了，谢谢。没错。我想，经过我们所有的讨论和反思，我认为亲密的朋友绝对是
[00:47:35.730] really valuable and sometimes it takes some patience to like turn a friend into a close friend so as we kind of mentioned maybe if a friend's not a close friend right now it could take a few years as we un-awkward ourselves like ramp back up from the pandemic
[00:47:35.730] 真的很有价值，有时候需要一些耐心才能把朋友变成知己。就像我们之前提到的，如果现在一个朋友还不是知己，可能需要几年时间，因为我们需要时间来克服疫情带来的隔阂，慢慢恢复正常生活。
[00:47:54.930] regain our social skills and all of that and I think we talked a lot about just the experiences and like how we hang out with friends so I guess moral of the story is as long as we treat our
[00:47:54.930] 重新找回我们的社交技能等等，我想我们聊了很多关于这些经历以及我们如何与朋友们相处的事情，所以我想这个故事的寓意是，只要我们善待彼此……
[00:48:06.850] friendships well and like do enjoyable things with them then like that's already really good. We don't have to force labels necessarily on people just spending good time and energy on good people is the best course of action we don't have to think about it too hard.
[00:48:06.850] 友谊美满，和朋友一起做些有趣的事情，这就很好了。我们没必要强求别人和我们建立关系，把时间和精力花在好人身上才是最好的选择，没必要想太多。
