[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal, I'm Jeesoo and I'm I.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo，我是我自己。
[00:00:16.000]  Welcome back I, the last time she was on the podcast with us was episode 171 Relationship Self versus Single Self.
[00:00:16.000] 欢迎回来，I，她上次和我们一起做客播客节目是第 171 集“恋爱中的自我 vs 单身时的自我”。
[00:00:26.000]  This one was a popular episode and I feel like we explored a lot of ourselves in this one.
[00:00:26.000] 这一集很受欢迎，我觉得我们在这一集中探索了很多关于我们自己的事情。
[00:00:31.000]  So definitely check it out if you haven't listened to it already. And to start off this episode we have a Gen Z phrase of the week.
[00:00:31.000] 所以，如果你还没听过，一定要去听听。本期节目一开始，我们先来聊聊本周的Z世代流行语。
[00:00:41.000]  The phrase is, is blank in the room with us now. This one is pretty interesting.
[00:00:41.000] 这句话现在在我们房间里是空白的。这很有意思。
[00:00:49.000]  At first, when I saw this, I thought this was some reference to an Eminem song or something.
[00:00:49.000] 起初我看到这个的时候，还以为这是在致敬埃米纳姆的某首歌之类的。
[00:00:55.000]  I don't even know why that's a millennial statement.
[00:00:55.000] 我甚至不知道为什么这会被认为是千禧一代的说法。
[00:00:59.000]  I think I was thinking of what is it like who's the real slum shade here something?
[00:00:59.000] 我当时在想，这里真正的贫民窟居民到底是什么样的人？
[00:01:05.000]  Oh, I don't know why but that's what immediately were my mind when the first time I ever read this phrase.
[00:01:05.000] 哦，我也不知道为什么，但当我第一次读到这句话时，我脑海里立刻浮现的就是这个画面。
[00:01:13.000]  But it is its own phrase and the meaning behind it is basically calling out, oh you claim that this thing is here but is it actually here?
[00:01:13.000] 但它本身就是一个短语，其背后的含义基本上是在质问：哦，你声称这东西在这里，但它真的在这里吗？
[00:01:25.000]  Like I don't see it essentially. So I'm sorry that's like not the best explanation.
[00:01:25.000] 我基本上没看懂。所以很抱歉，这可能不是最好的解释。
[00:01:30.000]  I feel like it's best understood when you see it being used out in the wild.
[00:01:30.000] 我觉得只有在实际应用中才能真正理解它。
[00:01:36.000]  I guess like one example, very rudimentary example would be like someone's on TikTok and they're kind of doing story time.
[00:01:36.000] 我想举个例子，一个非常简单的例子，比如有人在TikTok上讲故事。
[00:01:44.000]  My friends and I were doing this ball ball ball and people don't believe the story then they could comment like, oh are your friends in the room with us right now?
[00:01:44.000] 我和朋友们在玩球球球游戏，人们不相信这个故事，他们可能会评论说，哦，你的朋友们现在和我们在一起吗？
[00:01:54.000]  Yeah, I feel like another kind of example that I've seen is someone was doing some sort of remodeling project
[00:01:54.000] 是的，我感觉我见过的另一种例子是，有人正在进行某种改造工程
[00:02:02.000]  and then she was like, I'm remodeling this fireplace to use some sort of like specific method.
[00:02:02.000] 然后她就说，我要改造这个壁炉，采用某种特定的方法。
[00:02:09.000]  Let's pretend it was called the wash method or some shit.
[00:02:09.000] 我们就假装它叫洗涤法之类的吧。
[00:02:12.000]  And then I guess the results of how the fireplace came out wasn't the wash method at all.
[00:02:12.000] 然后，我猜想壁炉最终呈现出的效果根本不是清洗法的效果。
[00:02:17.000]  So then all the comments were like, is the wash method in the room with us right now?
[00:02:17.000] 所以当时所有的评论都是：现在房间里有清洗方法吗？
[00:02:22.000]  Yeah, I think it's really funny because it really just calls out sometimes misused words or misdefined words
[00:02:22.000] 是啊，我觉得这真的很有趣，因为它确实会指出一些用错的词或定义错误的词。
[00:02:30.000]  or even just bad takes sometimes.
[00:02:30.000] 或者有时候只是糟糕的看法。
[00:02:33.000]  But I was looking at the origin of this on KnowYourMeam.com, our favorite website.
[00:02:33.000] 但我是在我们最喜欢的网站 KnowYourMeam.com 上查找这件事的起源的。
[00:02:39.000]  And it says a possible origin of this can be dated back all the way to 2000 in season 11 of The Simpsons where Marge is interrogated by a panel of doctors
[00:02:39.000] 文章指出，这种现象的可能起源可以追溯到2000年播出的《辛普森一家》第11季，当时玛吉被一组医生审问。
[00:02:54.000]  and after they hear her pray under her breath, the doctor is like, this God is he in the room right now?
[00:02:54.000] 当他们听到她低声祈祷时，医生心想，上帝现在就在房间里吗？
[00:03:03.000]  Yeah, there's something so like horror movie-esque about the joke.
[00:03:03.000] 是啊，这个笑话确实有点恐怖电影的味道。
[00:03:10.000]  When they do the Ouija boards in horror movies, they're always kind of like, oh are you in the room with us right now?
[00:03:10.000] 恐怖电影里玩碟仙的时候，他们总是会说：“哦，你现在和我们在一起吗？”
[00:03:16.000]  Or something like that? So I wonder if it's based on that.
[00:03:16.000] 或者类似的东西？所以我怀疑它是不是基于此。
[00:03:19.000]  But we think because I'm always kind of recalling that horror movie sequence when someone says this,
[00:03:19.000] 但我们认为，这是因为每当有人这么说的时候，我总会想起那部恐怖电影里的场景。
[00:03:25.000]  it sort of reminds me of another line from horror movies which is, oh the call is coming from inside of the house.
[00:03:25.000] 这让我想起恐怖电影里的另一句台词：“哦，电话是从房子里面打来的。”
[00:03:33.000]  Like do everyone people used to say that? That was more of when people were being hypocritical in their claims.
[00:03:33.000] 以前每个人都这么说吗？那更多是指人们言行不一的时候。
[00:03:38.000]  But I remember that one was pretty funny too.
[00:03:38.000] 但我记得那一个也挺搞笑的。
[00:03:41.000]  I remember the movie that sparked that too. It's like some movie about the killer being inside the home.
[00:03:41.000] 我也记得引发这件事的那部电影。好像是那种凶手潜伏在房子里的电影。
[00:03:47.000]  But also for this phrase, I feel like I've only ever seen it in like comment form.
[00:03:47.000] 但就这句话而言，我感觉我好像只在评论里见过它。
[00:03:52.000]  I've never heard someone say it in real life.
[00:03:52.000] 我从未在现实生活中听人说过这句话。
[00:03:55.000]  It's always just like comments kind of bagging on like the original poster.
[00:03:55.000] 评论区总是充斥着对原帖作者的嘲讽和挖苦。
[00:04:01.000]  I'm gonna look for the right opportunity now.
[00:04:01.000] 我现在要寻找合适的时机。
[00:04:04.000]  Not as I'm educated with these Gen Z terms.
[00:04:04.000] 我并不了解这些Z世代的词汇。
[00:04:10.000]  Yeah, I agree though. I think this phrase is low key so funny, but I think it's most appropriate in like text form.
[00:04:10.000] 是啊，我也同意。我觉得这句话其实挺搞笑的，但我觉得用文字表达最合适。
[00:04:18.000]  I feel like when you're texting someone too, it's like funny.
[00:04:18.000] 我觉得当你和别人发短信的时候，也挺搞笑的。
[00:04:21.000]  But then if someone were to say it in real life, maybe it might be too long.
[00:04:21.000] 但如果有人在现实生活中这么说，可能就太长了。
[00:04:25.000]  As soon as they say is something and I'm like, oh they're gonna say the room with us right now.
[00:04:25.000] 他们刚说完，我就想，哦，他们现在肯定要说和我们住同一个房间了。
[00:04:30.000]  And the joke is overall ready internally.
[00:04:30.000] 而这个笑话在内部整体上已经准备好了。
[00:04:33.000]  Okay, maybe I shouldn't try to find out for team.
[00:04:33.000] 好吧，也许我不应该去打听球队的情况。
[00:04:37.000]  We just say it hallow fast.
[00:04:37.000] 我们只是快速地念诵一遍。
[00:04:40.000]  Is in the room with us right now?
[00:04:40.000] 现在和我们在一起的人是谁？
[00:04:43.000]  Yeah, that was pretty good.
[00:04:43.000] 是的，那挺不错的。
[00:04:45.000]  I got a practice.
[00:04:45.000] 我得到了一次练习机会。
[00:04:48.000]  Well, we'll try to see if for the rest of this episode,
[00:04:48.000] 好，我们会在本集剩余部分看看情况如何。
[00:04:51.000]  I can slip in a is X in the room with us right now, a joke.
[00:04:51.000] 我可以插一句“X现在是不是和我们在一起？”，开个玩笑。
[00:04:55.000]  Okay, that's my challenge.
[00:04:55.000] 好的，这就是我面临的挑战。
[00:04:58.000]  I'm pretty excited to jump into the topic today, which is self esteem and confidence.
[00:04:58.000] 今天我很兴奋能和大家探讨这个话题，那就是自尊和自信。
[00:05:04.000]  I think these two are for the most parts synonymous, but I do kind of feel like there's a difference between the words a little bit.
[00:05:04.000] 我认为这两个词在很大程度上是同义词，但我确实感觉它们之间还是有点区别的。
[00:05:11.000]  So let's start by talking about what the difference is between self esteem and confidence to you guys.
[00:05:11.000] 那么，我们先来谈谈你们觉得自尊和自信有什么区别吧。
[00:05:17.000]  I kind of view self esteem as how you view yourself and then confidence is like how much you believe in yourself, I guess.
[00:05:17.000] 我个人认为，自尊就是你如何看待自己，而自信就是你对自己的信念程度。
[00:05:25.000]  So self esteem is more rooted in your identity maybe, and confidence is a little bit about how you perceive your ability to do stuff, you think.
[00:05:25.000] 所以自尊可能更多地根植于你的身份认同，而自信则在某种程度上与你如何看待自己做事的能力有关。
[00:05:35.000]  I guess like self esteem is almost like your personal evaluation of yourself in my mind.
[00:05:35.000] 我觉得自尊心就像是你对自己的一种自我评价。
[00:05:41.000]  Yeah, confidence is like the way that you go about doing things or like how much you can muster up some belief in yourself.
[00:05:41.000] 是的，自信就像你做事的方式，或者就像你对自己有多大的信念。
[00:05:51.000]  Because I think like self esteem is maybe more long term overall and then confidence, sometimes you can like muster up some confidence to do something, but like it maybe isn't always consistently there.
[00:05:51.000] 因为我觉得自尊心可能是一种更长远的品质，而自信，有时候你可以鼓起一些自信去做某件事，但它可能并不总是持续存在的。
[00:06:04.000]  Yeah, that resonates.
[00:06:04.000] 是的，我深有同感。
[00:06:06.000]  If we look at self esteem, the word self is there so it applies to your being versus confidence can be in a particular skill or something like that.
[00:06:06.000] 如果我们看一下自尊，其中的“自我”一词表明它指的是你的存在，而自信则可能指的是某种特定的技能或其他方面。
[00:06:17.000]  Yeah, there's something that seems a little bit more external about the word confidence to whether it's the way you are around other people or like how you feel about yourself around other people.
[00:06:17.000] 是的，自信这个词似乎更多地与外在有关，比如你在别人面前的表现，或者你在别人面前对自己的感觉。
[00:06:28.000]  But self esteem feels like something that you may grapple with even when you're by yourself.
[00:06:28.000] 但自尊心似乎是你即使独处时也可能需要面对的问题。
[00:06:33.000]  So then it feels like a lot more internal of a word definitely saying they're pretty similar though we're in like the same category.
[00:06:33.000] 所以感觉这个词更多的是一种内在的表达，肯定地说它们非常相似，尽管我们属于同一类别。
[00:06:42.000]  So I just quickly googled the definitions of these terms and it says that self esteem is how we value and perceive ourselves.
[00:06:42.000] 所以我快速地在谷歌上搜索了这些术语的定义，上面说自尊是我们如何评价和看待自己的。
[00:06:50.000]  And it's based on our opinions and beliefs about ourselves which can feel difficult to change.
[00:06:50.000] 而且，这是基于我们对自身的看法和信念，而这些看法和信念很难改变。
[00:06:56.000]  Whereas confidence is a feeling of self assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities.
[00:06:56.000] 而自信则是一种源于对自己能力或品质的认可而产生的自我肯定感。
[00:07:05.000]  Yeah, I like that.
[00:07:05.000] 是的，我喜欢。
[00:07:06.000]  I definitely feel that the confidence is like a state of being versus like the self esteem is almost like a more physical group almost.
[00:07:06.000] 我感觉自信更像是一种状态，而自尊则更像是一种外在的、外在的特质。
[00:07:15.000]  I think the definition was saying like beliefs and opinions about self.
[00:07:15.000] 我认为这个定义是指关于自我的信念和观点。
[00:07:19.000]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:19.000] 是的，我同意。
[00:07:20.000]  I think like self esteem kind of has that deeper meaning sort of like essentially you have more of that like self reflection attached to self esteem versus confidence is similar to what we're talking about.
[00:07:20.000] 我认为自尊心蕴含着更深层的意义，本质上，自尊心更多地与自我反思联系在一起，而自信则与我们讨论的内容类似。
[00:07:33.000]  And it's similar to what I said just like a state of being I can agree with that.
[00:07:33.000] 这和我之前说的很相似，就像一种存在状态，我同意这一点。
[00:07:38.000]  Yeah, they probably influence each other though in different ways.
[00:07:38.000] 是的，它们可能以不同的方式相互影响。
[00:07:42.000]  Like I feel like you can kind of fake confidence but self esteem you can't fake.
[00:07:42.000] 我觉得自信可以伪装，但自尊是装不出来的。
[00:07:49.000]  That's a good point.
[00:07:49.000] 说得有道理。
[00:07:50.000]  I think in some ways I think of the word self esteem in like the phrases that it's most used in and I feel like a lot of the times people are like
[00:07:50.000] 我觉得在某种程度上，我会在那些最常用的短语中想到“自尊”这个词，而且我觉得很多时候人们都会这样想：
[00:07:58.000]  that person's self esteem is low.
[00:07:58.000] 那个人自尊心很低。
[00:08:00.000]  That's like one of the most common usages of the word that I can recall and it makes me kind of perceive self esteem as maybe like your friendship with yourself, you know, it's like do you actually like yourself or not because if your self esteem is low, then I feel like your relationship with yourself is maybe bad or like in the men's a little bit but if your self esteem is high.
[00:08:00.000] 这是我能想到的最常见的用法之一，它让我觉得自尊就像你和自己的友谊，你知道，就像你真的喜欢自己吗？因为如果你的自尊很低，我觉得你和自己的关系可能不太好，或者有点像男性的情况，但如果你的自尊很高。
[00:08:23.000]  Then no matter what external things happen, it doesn't change the way you see yourself or the way you believe in yourself.
[00:08:23.000] 那么无论外界发生什么事情，都不会改变你对自己的看法或信念。
[00:08:30.000]  I see it almost as how you treat yourself and how you choose to think of yourself.
[00:08:30.000] 我认为这几乎取决于你如何对待自己以及你选择如何看待自己。
[00:08:36.000]  I think I can agree with that kind of like what we said earlier, you can have confidence in like some of your abilities but that doesn't necessarily translate to having good self esteem.
[00:08:36.000] 我觉得我同意这种说法，就像我们之前说的那样，你可以对自己的某些能力充满信心，但这并不一定意味着你拥有良好的自尊。
[00:08:48.000]  Yeah, it's hard because it's almost like chicken and egg because when you think about when you feel confident about something there's an underlying belief to that.
[00:08:48.000] 是的，这很难，因为它几乎就像是先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题，因为当你对某件事充满信心时，背后往往隐藏着某种信念。
[00:08:56.000]  Let's say you're confident at snowboarding.
[00:08:56.000] 假设你对单板滑雪很有信心。
[00:08:59.000]  So just let's go.
[00:08:59.000] 那我们走吧。
[00:09:01.000]  If your underlying belief is oh I'm good at this or like I'm good at learning this and that is kind of part of self esteem but it's obviously not encompassing every aspect of yourself.
[00:09:01.000] 如果你内心深处相信“哦，我擅长这个”或者“我擅长学习这个”，这虽然是自尊的一部分，但显然并不能涵盖你自身的方方面面。
[00:09:12.000]  Which is why I feel like they're very like tied together.
[00:09:12.000] 所以我觉得他们之间关系非常密切。
[00:09:15.000]  True, like the more self esteem you have the more whole your confidence is.
[00:09:15.000] 没错，就像你的自尊心越强，你的自信就越完整。
[00:09:21.000]  Yeah, like confidence in every area of yourself.
[00:09:21.000] 对，就像对自己各个方面都充满自信一样。
[00:09:25.000]  I guess you could start off small by building confidence in different areas of your life and skill set and then grow your self esteem through that potentially.
[00:09:25.000] 我认为你可以从小事做起，在生活和技能的不同领域建立自信，然后通过这些努力提升自尊心。
[00:09:37.000]  I think that makes sense.
[00:09:37.000] 我觉得这很有道理。
[00:09:39.000]  I like the way I perceive it almost is confidence is sort of the positive side and then self esteem is almost the negative side.
[00:09:39.000] 我喜欢这种看法，自信几乎是积极的一面，而自尊几乎是消极的一面。
[00:09:47.000]  And what I mean by that is confidence is always associated with something like strong that you have or something strong that you feel like, oh I'm having a good time feeling confident today or I feel confident about X Y and Z.
[00:09:47.000] 我的意思是，自信总是与你拥有的某种强大的东西，或者你感觉的某种强大的东西联系在一起，比如，哦，我今天感觉很自信，或者我对 X、Y 和 Z 有信心。
[00:09:58.000]  But then self esteem I feel like is the thing that supports you when the positive stuff goes away.
[00:09:58.000] 但我觉得，当积极的事情消失时，自尊心会支撑着你。
[00:10:03.000]  If you're having a bad day or if someone said to you, oh you're confident about the skill but I don't think you're good at it.
[00:10:03.000] 如果你今天心情不好，或者有人对你说：“哦，你对自己的技能很有信心，但我认为你并不擅长。”
[00:10:10.000]  For example, then your self esteem would be the thing that backs you up and it's like, hey what the hell?
[00:10:10.000] 例如，你的自尊心就会成为你的后盾，你会想，嘿，管他呢？
[00:10:14.000]  I am so good at it or even if this person thinks I'm bad at something that I'm confident about, I won't let it negatively affect the way I see myself sort of.
[00:10:14.000] 我在这方面非常擅长，或者即使这个人认为我在某些我自信的事情上做得不好，我也不会让它对我的自我认知产生负面影响。
[00:10:23.000]  Yeah, I love that.
[00:10:23.000] 是的，我喜欢这个。
[00:10:25.000]  There's like self esteem, there's like self image, there's like different words to kind of describe this bucket of thing but definitely self esteem has like interesting connotation to the phrase.
[00:10:25.000] 比如自尊，比如自我形象，有很多不同的词语可以用来描述这类东西，但自尊这个词组肯定有其有趣的内涵。
[00:10:37.000]  Also what Jesus had earlier like self esteem is often used in a way to be like, oh maybe this person has low self esteem.
[00:10:37.000] 此外，耶稣早先提到的自尊心，常常被用来表示，哦，也许这个人缺乏自尊心。
[00:10:46.000]  Like it's a little more on the negative side in terms of literal word usage.
[00:10:46.000] 从字面意义上的用词来看，它似乎更偏向负面。
[00:10:52.000]  And I can totally see that because sometimes when someone has high self esteem, instead of seeing self esteem we say like self confidence.
[00:10:52.000] 我完全能理解，因为有时候当一个人拥有很高的自尊心时，我们不会用“自尊”这个词，而是会说“自信”。
[00:11:00.000]  Yeah, self confidence also like self love is another thing but I feel like it's very similar.
[00:11:00.000] 是的，自信和自爱是两回事，但我觉得它们非常相似。
[00:11:07.000]  I don't know self esteem.
[00:11:07.000] 我不了解自尊。
[00:11:09.000]  Yeah, I feel like usually it is actually associated with the negative right now that I think about it.
[00:11:09.000] 是的，我仔细想想，感觉它现在通常确实与负面含义联系在一起。
[00:11:14.000]  Okay, well is there anything in particular you guys feel like helped grow your self love self esteem self confidence.
[00:11:14.000] 好的，那么你们觉得有什么特别的事情有助于提升自爱、自尊和自信吗？
[00:11:22.000]  So for me I think I have a pretty interesting perception of the word self esteem because I feel like it was always something that I really struggled with.
[00:11:22.000] 所以我觉得我对“自尊”这个词的理解相当有趣，因为我觉得这始终是我难以克服的问题。
[00:11:31.000]  I would definitely have moments and for long stretches of time too about feeling really confident but oftentimes those felt very temporary.
[00:11:31.000] 我肯定会有那么几个时刻，而且会持续很长时间，感觉自己非常自信，但通常这些感觉都非常短暂。
[00:11:41.000]  So then that's why to me self esteem is like an even bigger challenge than confidence because I think truly it's really hard at least in my experience to grow self esteem.
[00:11:41.000] 所以对我来说，自尊比自信更具挑战性，因为我觉得至少就我的经验而言，培养自尊真的很难。
[00:11:52.000]  Sometimes I felt like I was growing just my confidence and then my self esteem bucket would still be not filled essentially.
[00:11:52.000] 有时我觉得我的自信心在增强，但我的自尊心却始终没有得到满足。
[00:11:59.000]  So in the last I don't know like 20 years basically I felt like I was always kind of working on my self esteem and what finally helped in my eyes is honestly growing older.
[00:11:59.000] 所以在过去的二十年里，我感觉自己一直在努力提升自尊心，而最终帮助我重拾自信的，在我看来，其实是年龄的增长。
[00:12:14.000]  I feel like it was something that no matter what I did felt impossible to grow or improve in my teenage years or even in college years.
[00:12:14.000] 我觉得无论我做什么，在我的青少年时期甚至大学时期，这方面都无法成长或进步。
[00:12:25.000]  And a lot of it is just I think in those years you're just constantly around or like forced to be around many people every single day who are exactly your peers exactly your age and you know competing for similar spots and stuff.
[00:12:25.000] 我觉得很多时候，你每天都被迫和很多与你同龄、年龄相仿的人待在一起，争夺类似的位置等等。
[00:12:40.000]  And it's just hard to really break out of that comparison mindset but now that I'm older, I have my own life and you kind of start to see how people's lives branch out and people succeed and thrive in different ways not just the one set standard path.
[00:12:40.000] 摆脱这种攀比心态真的很难，但现在我年纪大了，有了自己的生活，你开始看到人们的生活是如何分岔的，人们是如何以不同的方式获得成功和发展的，而不仅仅是走一条固定的标准道路。
[00:12:57.000]  I feel like I have a lot less of a problem with myself esteem and I'm just so grateful to be living life as like a 27 year old woman because it's so much easier than being like a teenager or even like a college student aged woman, I think.
[00:12:57.000] 我觉得我的自尊心问题少了很多，我很感激自己能以27岁女性的身份生活，因为这比像十几岁的女孩甚至大学生那样生活要容易得多。
[00:13:15.000]  Yeah, I feel like I can definitely relate to age helping with self esteem and I think it's kind of similar to what you said G-Zoo where as you get older you see the different facets of like success and how it plays out differently for everyone.
[00:13:15.000] 是的，我觉得年龄增长确实有助于提升自尊心，这和你说的G-Zoo的观点有点类似，随着年龄增长，你会看到成功的不同层面，以及它对每个人来说不同的意义。
[00:13:34.000]  And I think along those lines seeing myself succeed was also like a self esteem slash confidence booster.
[00:13:34.000] 我觉得从这个角度来看，看到自己取得成功也增强了我的自尊心和自信心。
[00:13:44.000]  Like seeing your hard work pay off ends up being pretty encouraging and I think you know taking those wins and really appreciating them is helpful because I think it's also very easy to succeed and then be like, okay yeah but that was expected.
[00:13:44.000] 看到自己的努力得到回报，这真的很令人鼓舞。我觉得，懂得珍惜这些胜利是很有帮助的，因为我觉得成功之后很容易会想，好吧，但这也在意料之中。
[00:14:01.000]  And then you know it doesn't help self esteem at all or maybe it's like okay well that's just the baseline but it's like you know it's not always like that.
[00:14:01.000] 然后你知道，这根本无助于提升自尊心，或者也许你会觉得，好吧，这只是基准线，但你知道，情况并不总是如此。
[00:14:08.000]  If you celebrate each win it just I feel like it's better than to always like put yourself down so I think that kind of helped me and there was definitely one thing that someone said that really affected me for a long time and I sometimes still think about it but I think it was like a tutor or something.
[00:14:08.000] 如果你庆祝每一次胜利，我觉得这比总是贬低自己要好得多，所以我认为这对我有所帮助。而且，确实有人说过一句话，对我的影响持续了很长时间，我有时还会想起它，但我想那人好像是一位导师之类的。
[00:14:29.000]  And this guy was like yeah I didn't really go through the conventional school path. He had to like take some years off of school and like all that kind of stuff just because of a personal or like family stuff.
[00:14:29.000] 这个人说，是啊，我没走传统的求学之路。他因为个人或家庭原因，不得不休学几年之类的。
[00:14:41.000]  And he was like yeah and I turned out fine so at you all the class he was like I believe that you're all hard working and like pretty smart people.
[00:14:41.000] 他当时说：“是啊，我后来发展得也不错。”他对全班同学说：“我相信你们都很努力，而且都很聪明。”
[00:14:52.000]  So I think that like even if you end up taking an untraditional route you'll all end up okay.
[00:14:52.000] 所以我觉得，即使你最终选择了一条非传统的道路，你们最终都会没事的。
[00:14:58.000]  You seem like the type of people who had put in the work and really figure things out for yourself.
[00:14:58.000] 你们看起来像是那种会努力学习、自己想办法解决问题的人。
[00:15:03.000]  So that was like very encouraging and I think it left a deep impression on me because I was like wow this person like really believes in us and also this person is living proof of success in a less traditional path.
[00:15:03.000] 所以这真的非常鼓舞人心，我觉得这给我留下了深刻的印象，因为我觉得哇，这个人真的很相信我们，而且这个人本身就是一条非传统道路获得成功的活生生的例子。
[00:15:19.000]  Wow that's some good parenting right there.
[00:15:19.000] 哇，这真是好父母啊！
[00:15:23.000]  Damn but they weren't even my parents.
[00:15:23.000] 该死，但他们甚至都不是我的父母。
[00:15:26.000]  It was the tutor.
[00:15:26.000] 是家教。
[00:15:28.000]  For me it's like a very internal thing and it stems from my meditation practice and kind of all the personal development stuff that I consume in practice.
[00:15:28.000] 对我来说，这是一种非常内在的东西，它源于我的冥想练习以及我在练习中吸收的所有个人发展方面的知识。
[00:15:39.000]  I feel like I have made a lot of hard decisions in the last few years including like changing careers completely, quitting my nine to five, starting a business.
[00:15:39.000] 我觉得在过去的几年里，我做了很多艰难的决定，包括彻底改变职业、辞去朝九晚五的工作、创业。
[00:15:50.000]  And those are all put me in spaces where the limiting beliefs come up right and those are like thoughts that are low confidence and low self esteem.
[00:15:50.000] 这些都会让我陷入限制性信念的环境中，而这些信念就类似于缺乏自信和自卑的想法。
[00:16:03.000]  And I really have to notice them day to day and shift them essentially.
[00:16:03.000] 我真的需要每天注意它们，并做出相应的调整。
[00:16:08.000]  And I kind of know that this will never end because I know that I will never be satisfied with like the status quo.
[00:16:08.000] 我知道这件事永远不会结束，因为我知道我永远不会对现状感到满意。
[00:16:16.000]  There's this thing called like the terror barrier that Bob Proctor talks about and every time like you said a really high goal, you're going to hit this barrier because it's going against everything that you believe yourself to be right for example right now I'm starting a creative studio.
[00:16:16.000] 鲍勃·普罗克特谈到过一种叫做“恐怖屏障”的东西，就像你说的，每次你设定一个非常高的目标时，你都会碰到这个屏障，因为它违背了你认为自己是对的一切。例如，我现在正在创办一个创意工作室。
[00:16:32.000]  I've been in this industry for maybe one year like actually it's like a game and XR creative studio.
[00:16:32.000] 我入行大概一年了，其实我所在的是一家游戏和XR创意工作室。
[00:16:40.000]  So I'm hitting a lot of limiting beliefs, I don't have enough skills, I have no idea how to do this like how am I going to land any clients like all this kind of stuff.
[00:16:40.000] 所以我遇到了很多限制性信念，比如我技能不够，我不知道该怎么做，比如我该如何获得客户等等。
[00:16:50.000]  So in the future if I'm launching my own product or like fundraising money, there's always going to be a higher barrier which is why it's really important for me to be able to notice those thoughts that are you know channeling into self esteem and confidence and then changing them.
[00:16:50.000] 所以，将来如果我要推出自己的产品或者筹集资金，总会面临更高的门槛，因此对我来说，能够注意到那些影响自尊和自信的想法，然后改变它们，就显得非常重要。
[00:17:08.000]  And it was interesting when you brought up like that high school example because I recently like went to and finished grad school right and I felt feelings I haven't felt since like college basically because it was the exact same environment of we're all doing like different but very similar things in interactive media art.
[00:17:08.000] 你提到高中的例子很有意思，因为我最近刚读完研究生，感觉和大学时差不多，因为环境完全一样，我们都在做着不同但又非常相似的事情，比如互动媒体艺术。
[00:17:26.000]  And it was kind of this like little bubble right and now I'm doing a residency where you know there's like around 100 of us but I'm probably one of the like very few people like five people who are like early stages of their art career.
[00:17:26.000] 这就像一个小泡泡，对吧？现在我正在参加一个驻留项目，你知道，我们大概有 100 人，但我可能是极少数的五六个处于艺术生涯早期阶段的人之一。
[00:17:39.000]  So again, it's a lot of that imposter syndrome and thoughts of like oh I'm not as accomplished not as good as these people that I need to change.
[00:17:39.000] 所以，很多时候都是因为冒名顶替综合症，以及诸如“哦，我不如这些人有成就，不如这些人优秀，我需要改变”之类的想法。
[00:17:48.000]  It's a very moment to moment thing. I think it's crazy because like when I was in my marketing career, I never experienced imposter syndrome ever but now I have so many more times.
[00:17:48.000] 这完全取决于当下情况。我觉得很奇怪，因为在我从事市场营销工作的时候，我从来没有经历过冒名顶替综合症，但现在我却经历了很多次。
[00:18:00.000]  I think it's because I'm actually doing something I care about yeah and it's just like wow then like wow people have this feeling it sucks terrible.
[00:18:00.000] 我想是因为我真的在做自己喜欢的事情，然后就觉得，哇，人们会有这种感觉，真是太糟糕了。
[00:18:08.000]  I hate being not confident.
[00:18:08.000] 我讨厌缺乏自信。
[00:18:11.000]  Oh my god yeah, I think also another layer to art in particular is that it's pretty subjective so sometimes it's easy to be like oh shoot like I have no idea what people would think about this because it's like a little more on the subjective side.
[00:18:11.000] 我的天哪，是的，我觉得艺术的另一个层面在于它的主观性，所以有时候很容易会想，哎呀，我不知道人们会怎么想，因为它有点主观。
[00:18:29.000]  Yeah, you really have to like know yourself essentially and I think also love the process for you to like be in the field and kind of like shift that mindset from like outcome oriented to like process oriented.
[00:18:29.000] 是的，你真的需要了解自己，而且我认为你还需要热爱这个过程，才能在这个领域立足，并将思维方式从结果导向转变为过程导向。
[00:18:42.000]  So there's like a lot of little I think things and techniques that I've used.
[00:18:42.000] 所以我觉得我用了很多小技巧和方法。
[00:18:48.000]  Like when you're put in a situation where it's very easy to compare yourself to other people that's when your self esteem is like truly challenged.
[00:18:48.000] 当你身处一个很容易与他人比较的环境中时，你的自尊心就会真正受到挑战。
[00:18:56.000]  And one of the reasons why I feel like it's gone better for me now that I'm removed from school is you can't really compare your life to someone else's in your late 20s I think because you definitely can when you're like 18 right like you compare the college that you're going to to the college that someone else is going to essentially.
[00:18:56.000] 我觉得离开学校后我的生活反而更好了，其中一个原因是，到了二十七八岁，你很难再把自己的生活和别人的生活作比较了，因为当你十八岁的时候，你肯定会这么做，比如你会把自己上的大学和别人上的大学作比较。
[00:19:16.000]  In your late 20s I feel like everyone starts to kind of hone in on their biggest priorities in life and what they value and everyone has a different value set than other people right so then I feel like now at this age when I see someone else who's.
[00:19:16.000] 我觉得到了二十七八岁，每个人都会开始明确自己人生中最重要的事情和自己重视的东西，而且每个人的价值观都不一样，对吧？所以我觉得，到了这个年纪，当我看到其他人……
[00:19:31.000]  Say more successful in their career for example, I am not necessarily like wildly jealous of that anymore and I'm more so like oh well I curated maybe these other things or I really wanted to prioritize these other things in my life.
[00:19:31.000] 例如，如果有人在事业上更成功，我不再像以前那样非常嫉妒他们，我更多的是会想，哦，好吧，我可能也精心策划了其他事情，或者我真的想在生活中优先考虑其他事情。
[00:19:45.000]  So then that's why my life is different from this other persons for example. It's no longer like a one to one comparison which makes it so much easier but I can totally see how in grad school or in residency where it's almost like a direct competition kind of environment those feelings would stir up again.
[00:19:45.000] 所以这就是为什么我的生活与其他人不同的原因。不再是直接的比较，这让事情变得容易得多，但我完全可以理解，在研究生院或住院医师培训期间，在那种几乎是直接竞争的环境中，这些感觉会再次涌上心头。
[00:20:03.000]  That's like a great mindset to have though and I would want to channel more of that in my own life I think taking like a more non-traditional route.
[00:20:03.000] 这是一种很棒的心态，我想在自己的生活中更多地运用这种心态，走一条非传统的道路。
[00:20:13.000]  I see a lot of my creative friends I think struggle with sort of like especially like the Asian ones you know like don't have a normal job we're not married, don't have kids.
[00:20:13.000] 我看到我的很多有创造力的朋友，我觉得他们都在努力克服一些困难，尤其是像亚洲人那样，你知道，他们没有一份正常的工作，没有结婚，也没有孩子。
[00:20:23.000]  Yeah and I think kind of along this line of comparing yourself less with people around you. I think I kind of noticed that it felt better to not compare myself to other people as I was like growing up and going through high school and college so I kind of embraced that a little bit where I was like oh okay well maybe it's better that I don't you know just do what everyone else is doing mindlessly I guess especially when I knew that I have a lot of experience with my life and I'm not really happy about that.
[00:20:23.000] 是的，我觉得这有点像是在减少和周围人的比较。我注意到，在我成长、上高中和大学的过程中，不和别人比较的感觉更好，所以我慢慢接受了这一点，心想，好吧，也许我不盲目地随波逐流更好，尤其是我知道自己有很多人生经历，但我并不为此感到快乐。
[00:20:51.000]  I guess especially when I knew that I had an interest in a different subject then like you know what our parents want us to do or like what the typical Asian American stem route is.
[00:20:51.000] 我想尤其是当我意识到自己对一个与父母希望我们做的或典型的亚裔美国人所走的 STEM 道路不同的学科感兴趣时。
[00:21:04.000]  So I think I kind of embraced that and it felt good because one else like oh this is kind of nice because there's less pressure around me because there's less people to directly compare myself with or even like have other people compare me with.
[00:21:04.000] 所以我觉得我欣然接受了这一点，感觉很好，因为另一个人会想，哦，这挺好的，因为我周围的压力小了，因为没有那么多人可以直接和我比较，甚至没有人会拿我跟他们比较。
[00:21:19.000]  And then also it was like oh well I like doing this too so focusing on that joy helps reduce like constantly beating yourself up over like comparisons and things like that.
[00:21:19.000] 然后我又想，哦，我也喜欢做这件事，所以专注于这种快乐有助于减少因为比较之类的事情而不断地责备自己。
[00:21:30.000]  Yeah I think that's really key like the emotional aspect of it right like when I have a thought I see its impact on my emotional state and that's how I know if it's benefiting me or not benefiting me because you know when you're in that comparison mind that obviously does not feel good and not feeling good.
[00:21:30.000] 是的，我认为这才是关键，就像情感方面一样，对吧？当我产生一个想法时，我会看到它对我的情绪状态的影响，这就是我如何知道它是否对我有益或无益的方式，因为你知道，当你陷入比较的思维模式时，显然感觉不好，感觉很不好。
[00:21:48.000]  I mean there's so many things that not feeling good. That's the impact on but for first and foremost you probably want to be happier.
[00:21:48.000] 我的意思是，感觉不好会带来很多影响。这当然会造成影响，但首先，你可能最想做的就是更快乐。
[00:21:58.000]  So making that choice of like being proud yourself no matter what the outcome is I think it's like a combination of those little choices that you make that overall changed your general emotional outlook and self esteem.
[00:21:58.000] 所以，无论结果如何都选择为自己感到骄傲，我认为这就像是你做出的那些小选择的组合，最终改变了你的整体情绪状态和自尊心。
[00:22:11.000]  And I feel like on the flip side too it's also what kind of big choices that you make as well so like every day you kind of choose what sort of thoughts filter into your head and what you choose to keep and give power to.
[00:22:11.000] 我觉得另一方面，这也和你做出的重大选择有关，比如你每天都在选择哪些想法进入你的脑海，以及你选择保留哪些想法并赋予它们力量。
[00:22:25.000]  But I feel like if the big actions that you make or the big choices that you make in life are also choices that you are happy to make or that you choose to make to show up for yourself or do something for yourself.
[00:22:25.000] 但我感觉，如果你在生活中做出的重大行动或重大选择，也是你乐于做出的选择，或者你选择做出这些选择是为了自己，为了自己而做的事情。
[00:22:37.000]  Then I feel like yourself esteem grows significantly more than if you're kind of letting yourself get pulled one direction or another without your own choice in it basically.
[00:22:37.000] 这样一来，我觉得你的自尊心会比你任由自己被拉向某个方向而没有自主选择时增长得更多。
[00:22:49.000]  So then I feel like it really is a combination of the big actions and like the daily small choices.
[00:22:49.000] 所以我觉得，这真的是大事和日常小选择共同作用的结果。
[00:22:55.000]  Yeah totally in personal development slash manifestation I suppose there's like thoughts emotions and then the action like without action nothing will actually manifest but a lot of times what drives the action is the emotions and the thoughts so it's like all very interconnected right.
[00:22:55.000] 是的，在个人发展/显化过程中，我认为确实存在思想、情感和行动，没有行动，什么都不会真正显化，但很多时候，驱动行动的是情感和思想，所以这一切都是相互关联的，对吧。
[00:23:13.000]  And as you continue to make the actions that are supporting the new emotions and thoughts and beliefs that you want to think and believe and feel then you start changing your life and becoming this person who is more confident and has more self esteem.
[00:23:13.000] 当你不断采取行动来支持你想要思考、相信和感受的新情绪、想法和信念时，你就会开始改变你的生活，成为一个更加自信、更有自尊的人。
[00:23:28.000]  Another thing that I think has helped me is having very short term goals as in like probably still having some long term goals but really focusing on the now what can I do now.
[00:23:28.000] 我觉得对我有帮助的另一件事是设定非常短期的目标，就像可能仍然有一些长期目标，但真正专注于现在我能做什么。
[00:23:41.000]  So like I was saying taking that action and then celebrating the small wins and then before you know it you kind of reach that long term goal versus like if you're always just focus on the long term goal and like what's not awaiting for you in the future.
[00:23:41.000] 就像我刚才说的，采取行动，然后庆祝小的胜利，不知不觉中你就会实现长期目标，而不是总是只关注长期目标，而忽略未来没有发生的事情。
[00:23:58.000]  Then it's a constant battle right cuz you're like oh when will I achieve this big huge goal versus like i'm so proud of myself.
[00:23:58.000] 这样一来，就变成了一场持续不断的斗争，因为你会想“哦，我什么时候才能实现这个伟大的目标”，同时又会觉得“我为自己感到非常自豪”。
[00:24:07.000]  I like did this today and it's bringing me one step closer to this bigger goal that I haven't mind so I think really shifting your mindset there to focus on the smaller what can I do now things versus always looking into like not now so like the future or whatever.
[00:24:07.000] 我今天做了这件事，这让我离我一直以来的更大目标更近了一步，我并不介意。所以我认为，真正转变你的思维方式，专注于我现在能做的小事，而不是总是想着“现在不行，而是未来”之类的事情，才是关键。
[00:24:25.000]  I think that's a really good point it's like setting yourself up many success milestones so that you're constantly sort of relishing and that feeling of success instead of the binary of like no I haven't achieved my goal this entire time and then yes I have achieved my goal.
[00:24:25.000] 我认为这是一个很好的观点，就像给自己设定许多成功里程碑，这样你就可以不断地享受成功的感觉，而不是非此即彼地想：不，我一直没有实现我的目标，然后，是的，我已经实现了我的目标。
[00:24:40.000]  I love that and I even do that like on a daily basis with the smallest things if I met you today like fuck yeah i'm so proud of myself.
[00:24:40.000] 我喜欢这样，我甚至每天都会这样做，哪怕是最小的事情。如果我今天遇到你，我会说：太棒了，我为自己感到骄傲。
[00:24:50.000]  Or like you know if I stretch for 10 minutes then like let's go that's something that I did today and I think like really focusing on the daily things and like also okay in this moment like what are the choices i'm making that.
[00:24:50.000] 或者你知道，如果我伸展 10 分钟，那就好，这是我今天做的事情，我觉得就像真正专注于日常琐事，以及此刻我正在做出的选择。
[00:25:02.000]  I am taking care of myself with or are making me happy those are really important choices too so celebrating those as well and like something i've been doing lately just thinking about what i'm actually doing every day that's making me happy versus what i'm thinking is making me happy.
[00:25:02.000] 我正在照顾自己，或者说，我正在让自己快乐，这些都是非常重要的选择，所以也要庆祝这些选择。就像我最近一直在做的一件事，就是思考我每天实际做的哪些事情让我快乐，而不是我以为哪些事情让我快乐。
[00:25:18.000]  Which a lot of times is connected to this long term future projected goals.
[00:25:18.000] 这往往与长期的未来预期目标有关。
[00:25:25.000]  Yeah you know which is like a clear way to be unhappy is to constantly feel that gap between where you are now and where you are in the future.
[00:25:25.000] 是啊，你知道，总是感到自己现在所处的位置和未来之间存在差距，这显然是让自己不快乐的原因之一。
[00:25:34.000]  Exactly it's like it's always easier said than done though because it's kind of like the idea of worrying constantly you're like you're worrying about something in the future and you can't really do anything about it now except worry.
[00:25:34.000] 没错，但说起来容易做起来难，因为这就像不断地担忧，你担心的是未来的事情，而你现在除了担忧之外什么也做不了。
[00:25:47.000]  But like it's hard to let go of that sometimes you have to be like really vigilant of those thoughts that are making you unhappy and I remember like last semester i was like doing my thesis not semester last year.
[00:25:47.000] 但有时候很难放下那些想法，你必须时刻警惕那些让你不快乐的想法。我记得上学期，我好像在写毕业论文，而不是去年的学期。
[00:26:01.000]  I was doing my thesis project and I felt like so much just like stressing anxiety at one point i was just like dude i don't know give a shit about my project anymore like i just need to be happy.
[00:26:01.000] 我当时在做毕业论文，感觉压力很大，焦虑得不行，有那么一段时间，我甚至觉得，老兄，我再也不在乎我的论文了，我只想快乐起来。
[00:26:12.000]  And like it was that kind of moment of extreme discomfort and dissatisfaction that push me into a new direction so i think that happens to a lot of people a lot of times it's called like the dark night of the soul where you finally decide to make a different decision for yourself.
[00:26:12.000] 就像那种极度的不适和不满的时刻，促使我走向了一个新的方向。我认为这种情况经常发生在很多人身上，这被称为灵魂的暗夜，你最终决定为自己做出不同的选择。
[00:26:28.000]  I like that and i think that makes a lot of sense too because it's like the turning point or something that's like snapping you out of it you're like wait what am i even doing here like i don't care about this.
[00:26:28.000] 我喜欢这个说法，而且我觉得这很有道理，因为它就像一个转折点，或者说某种让你幡然醒悟的东西，你会想，等等，我到底在这里做什么？我根本不在乎这些。
[00:26:40.000]  Yeah totally.
[00:26:40.000] 完全同意。
[00:26:42.000]  I mean ideally you start to change before that happens.
[00:26:42.000] 我的意思是，理想情况下，你应该在那件事发生之前就开始改变。
[00:26:46.000]  But sometimes you can't help but to get there.
[00:26:46.000] 但有时候，你不得不去那里。
[00:26:50.000]  Yeah exactly us humans in our silly patterns actually so i've been trying this new thing recently where just become completely like delusional almost and is a really funny and like fun technique.
[00:26:50.000] 没错，我们人类确实有这些愚蠢的习惯。所以我最近尝试了一种新方法，就是让自己完全沉浸在幻想中，这真的很有趣。
[00:27:04.000]  I don't want to say pretend to become someone else I need to like become someone else so like for example i was like surfing and i don't know why i'm just eating so much shit for like a full hour and a half into my surf session.
[00:27:04.000] 我不想说假装变成另一个人，我需要变成另一个人，比如，我当时在冲浪，但我不知道为什么，在冲浪的一个半小时里，我一直在吃屎。
[00:27:18.000]  And i was observing my thoughts right and they were just so negative i was like man everyone's look at me i'm so embarrassed like i've surfed so many times before i do not know what is happening am i even going to catch a wave today like all this shit.
[00:27:18.000] 我当时正在观察自己的想法，结果发现全是消极的想法，我就想，天哪，大家都看着我，我好尴尬，我以前冲过那么多次浪，现在却不知道发生了什么，我今天还能冲到浪吗？诸如此类的糟心事。
[00:27:31.000]  And then all of a sudden i'm like dude i cannot this energy is why i am not catching a wave so i literally pretended i was a pro surfer and i look at people and i'm like i'm better than you i'm better than you.
[00:27:31.000] 然后突然间我就想，老兄，我不能这样，就是这种能量让我抓不到浪，所以我干脆假装自己是职业冲浪运动员，看着别人说，我比你们强，我比你们强。
[00:27:44.000]  Like you suck like i'm a pro surfer like i literally just started repeating those thoughts in my head instead to like flip right because i just like cannot say that negative energy for anymore and i kid you not within the next like 10 minutes i figured out why i was eating shit and then i like caught most of the ways after that.
[00:27:44.000] 就像你很菜，而我却是个职业冲浪选手，我真的开始在脑子里反复想这些话，而不是像往常那样向右翻转，因为我真的不能再承受这种负能量了，而且我跟你说真的，在接下来的10分钟内，我就明白了我为什么会摔得这么惨，然后我就掌握了之后的大部分技巧。
[00:28:04.000]  And that was just like kind of a crazy experience for me of like holy shit when i'm in this negative mind state or like tying it back to confidence and self-esteem when i'm in this like negative confidence state like i cannot see a new path forward when i switch my mindset to becoming a pro surfer.
[00:28:04.000] 对我来说，那真是一次疯狂的经历，就像天哪，当我处于这种消极的心态，或者说，当我处于这种消极的自信状态，比如我看不到前进的新道路，当我转变心态成为一名职业冲浪运动员时，我却看不到。
[00:28:25.000]  There's obviously a problem that i need to solve here with my serving like it's not because i suck i just have some sort of like wrong technique right.
[00:28:25.000] 很明显，我的发球存在一些问题需要解决，这并不是因为我技术差，而是我的发球技巧有问题，对吧？
[00:28:32.000]  Boom saw like two women with like same size surfboard same size as me realize i was too forward on my surfboard it was such an easy thing to solve after that.
[00:28:32.000] Boom 看到两个女人拿着和我差不多大小的冲浪板，意识到我的冲浪姿势太靠前了，之后这个问题就很容易解决了。
[00:28:42.000]  So since that experience i've been like trying it with a lot of different things and it's been really fun actually just like being like delusional but self-aware that you're being delusional.
[00:28:42.000] 从那次经历之后，我一直在尝试用很多不同的方式来体验这种感觉，实际上真的很有趣，就像是处于一种妄想状态，但又意识到自己是在妄想。
[00:28:53.000]  It's like your brainwashing yourself kind of yeah basically you're just becoming a different person.
[00:28:53.000] 这就像是在给自己洗脑，嗯，基本上你就是变成了另一个人。
[00:29:02.000]  Yeah essentially i think i've actually done similar things too and some of it is from survival mode so like recently i went skiing and i was going down this bloom that blue was probably like the hardest course that i had skewed that weekend going down it i had to like if i wanted to make it down in one piece i had to like talk myself through it
[00:29:02.000] 是的，基本上我也做过类似的事情，有些是出于生存本能。比如最近我去滑雪，滑的是一条蓝色的雪道，那大概是我那个周末滑过的最难的雪道了。滑下去的时候，如果我想安全滑下来，就得不断给自己打气。
[00:29:22.000]  So then i was like okay i can do this i can do this like you're not going to die the worst is you're going to fall just turn here like i was literally like coaxing myself down the mountain essentially.
[00:29:22.000] 所以我就想，好吧，我可以的，我可以的，就像你不会死的，最糟糕的情况就是你会摔倒，只要在这里转弯就行了，我基本上就是在哄着自己下山。
[00:29:31.000]  And then i was like holy shit this is crazy growth for me because one of the things that my therapist had first said to me when we started our sessions together was she was like i don't know why you talked to yourself like that and i was like oh what do you mean she's like anytime you describe yourself or like talk about yourself.
[00:29:31.000] 然后我就想，我的天哪，这对我来说是巨大的成长，因为我的治疗师在我们开始咨询时对我说的第一件事就是，她说，我不知道你为什么那样跟自己说话，我说，哦，你是什么意思？她说，每当你描述自己或谈论自己的时候。
[00:29:47.000]  You use such negative words and i feel like it really puts you in the state of self-defense or kind of like putting yourself down and she's like it's going to render you like immobile basically so like you have to kind of talk to yourself like a friend.
[00:29:47.000] 你总是用一些负面的词语，我觉得这真的会让你处于一种自我防卫的状态，或者有点像是在贬低自己，她说这基本上会让你动弹不得，所以你必须像和朋友说话一样和自己对话。
[00:30:00.000]  And then i realized that maybe the therapy is fucking working because you know me seeing down this mountain pre therapist i feel like i would have been like oh my god i can't do this i'm gonna cry i can't do this like this is so hard.
[00:30:00.000] 然后我意识到，也许治疗真的有效，因为你知道，在接受治疗之前，当我从山上往下看的时候，我觉得我会想，哦我的天哪，我做不到，我要哭了，我做不到，这太难了。
[00:30:13.000]  Why did James or whoever like take me down the mountain but now i was like able to kind of talk myself through it like i would a friend.
[00:30:13.000] 为什么詹姆斯或者其他什么人把我从山上带下来，而现在我却能像和朋友聊天一样，自己跟自己解释清楚呢？
[00:30:21.000]  So then i feel like there is oftentimes like a power towards and a power to the attitude because negativity like you said i could like totally blind you and it could block you from being like even just baseline rational essentially.
[00:30:21.000] 所以我觉得，态度往往具有某种力量，因为正如你所说，消极情绪会完全蒙蔽你的双眼，甚至会阻碍你保持基本的理性。
[00:30:35.000]  Totally once you notice that voice in your head you're like oh wait actually i don't see with you.
[00:30:35.000] 一旦你注意到脑海中的那个声音，你就会想：哦等等，其实我并不认同你。
[00:30:41.000]  You're like shut up.
[00:30:41.000] 你就像在说“闭嘴”。
[00:30:43.000]  You're like wait pause i actually i don't want to think that about myself or like about like situations about other people so i think yeah it's a moment of self awareness and then deciding like okay i'm actually going to like treat myself differently or perceive myself in a different way and that will make a huge huge difference.
[00:30:43.000] 你会想，等等，停一下，其实我不想那样看待自己，也不想那样看待别人的情况，所以我想，是的，这是一个自我意识觉醒的时刻，然后决定，好吧，我真的要以不同的方式对待自己，或者以不同的方式看待自己，这将会带来巨大的改变。
[00:31:04.000]  Yeah i'm reflecting on like my personal inner voice and i think i have this funny thing where sometimes in like more dire or tense situations i actually talk to myself in second person.
[00:31:04.000] 是的，我正在反思我内心的声音，我觉得我有个很奇怪的毛病，就是有时候在比较危急或紧张的情况下，我竟然会用第二人称跟自己说话。
[00:31:18.000]  So it's more like oh it's all good crystal like we can do this we'll pull through and i feel like that kind of helps sometimes because it's like oh shit we're a team but it's actually just me.
[00:31:18.000] 所以更像是“哦，一切都好，克里斯托，我们可以做到，我们会挺过去的”，我觉得这有时很有帮助，因为感觉就像“哦，天哪，我们是一个团队”，但实际上只有我一个人。
[00:31:30.000]  Yeah i love that you are a team with your inner being.
[00:31:30.000] 是的，我喜欢你和你的内在自我和谐相处的这种感觉。
[00:31:36.000]  It gives a sense of like togetherness maybe like oh actually i'm not in this by myself although you totally are but like you know just that like you said the power words it feels more yeah we got this like let's go through this.
[00:31:36.000] 它给人一种团结的感觉，就像“哦，其实我不是孤身一人”，虽然你确实是孤身一人，但你知道，就像你说的那些充满力量的话语，感觉更像是“是的，我们能行”，就像“让我们一起度过难关”。
[00:31:52.000]  Personally i believe in higher self which is like your divine version of yourself that's like always guiding you so like when you were talking about talking yourself in like second person i was thinking about that.
[00:31:52.000] 我个人相信高我，它就像你神圣的自我版本，一直在指引着你。所以，当你谈到用第二人称与自己对话时，我就想到了这一点。
[00:32:05.000]  Like you acting as your higher self guiding your human self perhaps to a better place.
[00:32:05.000] 就像你扮演着更高层次的自我，引导着你的人类自我走向更好的境界。
[00:32:12.000]  Alright i like that more.
[00:32:12.000] 好吧，我更喜欢这个。
[00:32:14.000]  It makes total sense though like i also refer to myself in the second person sometimes and then it just makes sense because i me right but then i feel like myself like that one is like a different part of me like it's not the same thing as me itself like the person who's talking.
[00:32:14.000] 这完全说得通，就像我有时也会用第二人称称呼自己一样，这样就说得通了，因为我就是我自己，对吧？但那样我又觉得，那个“我”就像是我的一部分，就像它和说话的我本身不是同一个人。
[00:32:32.000]  But i feel like there are two different things sometimes it almost feels like my body is like a tomagotchi or something i need to control i'm just like the avatar in my physical vessel and i need to like do stuff to like make sure it goes out and get some sun or get some exercise or drink water so it's kind of funny to think about it in that way.
[00:32:32.000] 但我有时感觉这好像是两回事，感觉我的身体就像一个电子宠物，需要我去控制，我就像我肉体容器里的化身，需要做一些事情，比如确保它出去晒晒太阳、做做运动、喝喝水，这样想还挺有意思的。
[00:32:52.000]  Oh god that is funny see now we're getting real spiritual.
[00:32:52.000] 我的天啊，这太搞笑了，你看，我们现在真的开始讲精神层面的东西了。
[00:32:56.000]  Are we really dude all those games in our childhood tomagotchi like the 10 dogs it was just training us to take care of ourselves in the future.
[00:32:56.000] 我们真的觉得小时候玩的那些游戏，比如电子宠物和十只小狗，都是在训练我们将来照顾自己吗？
[00:33:06.000]  Oh my gosh what do you think are like your biggest maybe triggers or like obstacles that make you feel low self esteem.
[00:33:06.000] 我的天哪，你觉得让你感到自卑的最大诱因或障碍是什么？
[00:33:18.000]  My bouts of low self esteem typically come from one thing so i have always kind of grappled with feeling low self esteem about my weight and that's been like an ongoing journey like my entire life and i don't think it's exclusive to me like i think it's relatively common especially for a lot of women when you know the arrow we grew up there were always those magazine covers up like this person gained weight you know like this person looks fat so i'm like i'm not sure if i'm going to get a shot or not.
[00:33:18.000] 我的自卑感通常源于一件事，所以我一直以来都在与体重带来的自卑感作斗争，这就像是我一生中持续不断的旅程，而且我认为这并非我独有，我认为这相当普遍，尤其对很多女性而言。你知道，在我们成长的年代，杂志封面上总是会出现这样的画面：这个人胖了，这个人看起来很胖，所以我就会想，我不确定自己是否应该去打针。
[00:33:46.000]  Like this person looks fat so then i think a lot of that negative association with our weight was kind of maybe built into our childhood in a sense but anytime i have weight fluctuations for example it really messes with my self esteem.
[00:33:46.000] 比如这个人看起来很胖，所以我认为我们对体重的负面联想可能在某种程度上是童年时期形成的，但每当我的体重出现波动时，都会严重影响我的自尊心。
[00:34:02.000]  And this actually kind of goes both ways so i feel like there's times where i wake up and i feel very thin and i'm like oh my god i often call those days like my Kanye days or like you know i'm like in my Kanye era
[00:34:02.000] 其实这种情况是双向的，有时候我醒来会觉得自己很瘦，然后就会想，天哪，我经常把那些日子叫做我的“坎耶时代”，或者说，你知道，我感觉自己好像进入了“坎耶时代”。
[00:34:15.000]  and the times where i feel really confident about my body but there are of course times where i wake up and i don't feel that way so then i think those things always kind of shake up my confidence and it's really tough to kind of break it i think like break this mentality
[00:34:15.000] 有时候我对自己的身材非常自信，但当然也有时候，我醒来后并没有这种感觉，所以我觉得这些事情总是会动摇我的自信，而且我觉得很难打破这种心态。
[00:34:32.000]  and i think i actually have made some really big strides over the last couple of years but it i think stems from trying not to hold negative thoughts about my character based on how the numbers of my weight looks like or based on how my body looks like.
[00:34:32.000] 我觉得在过去的几年里，我确实取得了很大的进步，但我认为这源于我努力不去根据我的体重数字或我的身材来对自己的性格抱有负面想法。
[00:34:50.000]  Everyone can have weight fluctuations and everyone can have times where they feel more confident in their physical appearance but that doesn't mean on days where i feel low confidence in my physical appearance i'm like a shitty person you know i always just need to like make that line in between those things but of course it's definitely hard.
[00:34:50.000] 每个人都会有体重波动，每个人都会有对自己外貌更有自信的时候，但这并不意味着当我对自己外貌缺乏自信的时候，我就变成了一个糟糕的人。你知道，我总是需要在这两者之间划清界限，但这当然很难。
[00:35:10.000]  yeah i feel like that's such a common insecurity that a lot of people have especially because our world is so people always try to kind of like cover up but like i think our society is very very like externally you know like physically driven or physical looks driven we can't help it sometimes because that's kind of just like what we see right and then based off that.
[00:35:10.000] 是的，我觉得这是很多人都有的普遍不安全感，尤其是在我们这个世界，人们总是试图掩盖什么。但我觉得我们的社会非常注重外表，你知道，就是外貌，我们有时无法避免，因为我们看到的就是这些，然后就以此为依据。
[00:35:38.000]  it's just really easy to go down the path of like making judgments or you know not seeing the full picture but like jumping to conclusions and i feel like it messes with a lot of people especially like if you think about how there's so many like filters on social media and people have been kind of calling it out more and more where they're like oh my god some of these filters are insane like people just fucking wake up put on a filter they don't even have to like you know i just make some look perfect.
[00:35:38.000] 人们很容易陷入妄下判断的陷阱，或者看不到事情的全貌就妄下结论。我觉得这会影响很多人，尤其是考虑到社交媒体上有那么多滤镜，人们也越来越多地指出这一点，他们会说：“我的天哪，有些滤镜太疯狂了，有些人醒来就直接用滤镜，根本不需要像我这样，让照片看起来完美无瑕。”
[00:36:08.000]  that's just so unreal but that's what people end up seeing and then it creates like all this like potential dysmorphia and stuff it's like it's such a crazy thing and i feel like it's definitely like very understandable to have fluctuating self esteem in regards to that i feel like also a big theme is like a lot of Asian Americans with immigrant parents they all kind of share a similar value of skininess among like woman is better.
[00:36:08.000] 这太不真实了，但人们最终看到的却是这样的，然后就造成了各种潜在的体像障碍之类的问题，这简直太疯狂了，我觉得在这种情况下，自尊心波动是完全可以理解的。我觉得还有一个很大的共同点是，很多亚裔美国人，他们的父母都是移民，他们似乎都持有类似的价值观，认为女性越瘦越好。
[00:36:38.000]  especially and i feel like that kind of fucks with us too from a young age i think we talked about it before on the podcast where parents are sometimes like oh my god like you got fatter or like oh i can tell you gained weight like you need to be skinnier but then like the next day they're like you'll eat more and you're like what the fuck do you want me to do.
[00:36:38.000] 尤其是我觉得这从小就对我们造成影响，我想我们之前在播客里也讨论过，父母有时会说“我的天哪，你变胖了”或者“我看得出来你长胖了，你需要瘦一点”，但第二天他们又会说“你会吃得更多”，然后你会想“你们到底想让我怎么办”。
[00:36:59.000]  while y'all were talking i was just thinking about like the specific triggers that like influence that and i think like media is a huge one which is why i don't fuck with like so i don't fuck with like instagram and tiktok especially because i feel like that part of self-man is really heavily perpetuated on that and i i immediately can feel the influence on it like day to day you know and i've also had that those moments of like waking up and just feeling like it's a skinny day or like.
[00:36:59.000] 你们说话的时候，我一直在想究竟是什么具体的触发因素会影响到这一点，我觉得媒体就是一个很大的因素，所以我不太玩Instagram和TikTok之类的社交媒体，尤其是我觉得自我认知的某些方面很大程度上是受这些平台影响的，我能立刻感受到它对我的影响，就像每天都在发生的那样。我也有过那种早上醒来就觉得今天状态很差的时候。
[00:37:29.000]  not so skinny day or whatever and like how i'm perceiving that as like good or bad and i'm like whoa what's happening or the matrix you know just like it's like crazy because those thoughts are formed by these like triggers and things that we see in society right.
[00:37:29.000] 那天我没那么瘦，或者别的什么，然后我就觉得，哇，这是怎么回事？或者说，这是矩阵吗？你知道，这太疯狂了，因为这些想法是由我们在社会中看到的这些触发因素和事物形成的，对吧。
[00:37:49.660]  and it's not actually me thinking that again so i think like removing those media sources for my life has really really really helped me a lot.
[00:37:49.660] 而且这真的不是我再次想到的，所以我认为，从我的生活中剔除这些媒体来源真的真的真的帮了我很大的忙。
[00:37:59.900]  and also just like realizing when i do look at myself in the mirror and think those thoughts it does not fucking feel good like i can feel it straight in my body.
[00:37:59.900] 而且，当我看着镜子里的自己，想到那些想法时，我意识到那种感觉真的非常糟糕，我能直接感觉到身体里的不适。
[00:38:09.860]  i'm like really hyper aware of my emotions and the feelings by body and i know that is like to the exact like detriment of it.
[00:38:09.860] 我对自己的情绪和身体感受非常敏感，我知道这其实对我的身体有害。
[00:38:20.420]  so in those moments i really try to shift and like i'm obviously not perfect at it but i'm grateful that i have that awareness now of like oh shit i just.
[00:38:20.420] 所以在那些时刻，我真的会努力改变，虽然我显然做得并不完美，但我很感激我现在有了这种意识，比如“哦，糟糕，我只是……”
[00:38:31.340]  thought the start of me not looking great looking in the mirror and now i feel pit in my stomach like wow that sucks like i don't want to be like i don't want to live my life that way essentially.
[00:38:31.340] 一开始只是觉得照镜子时自己看起来不太好，现在我感觉胃里像压着一块石头，心想：哇，这太糟糕了，我不想这样，我不想那样生活。
[00:38:42.860]  yeah there's actually a lot of really interesting things that i feel like have felt small in the moment but have really changed the way that i look at food and like.
[00:38:42.860] 是的，实际上有很多非常有趣的事情，我觉得它们当时看起来很微不足道，但却真正改变了我对食物的看法和喜好。
[00:38:51.700]  appearance and things like that one of it is something that i sometimes struggle with is like binge eating so you know there those.
[00:38:51.700] 外貌之类的，其中有一点我有时会比较困扰，比如暴饮暴食，你知道的，就是这些。
[00:39:00.100]  weeks where maybe you're really good about eating all week and.
[00:39:00.100] 可能有些周你整周都吃得很好。
[00:39:03.620]  I don't want to fix like a value to how well someone eats but let's say i was eating pretty healthy so like chicken breast and salad and whatnot but there are also those moments where i'm like okay i just want to eat chips and like ice cream and cookies for example.
[00:39:03.620] 我不想给一个人的饮食健康程度设定一个标准，但假设我吃得很健康，比如鸡胸肉、沙拉之类的，但也有那么一些时候，我只想吃薯片、冰淇淋和饼干之类的。
[00:39:18.820]  so i used to look at those moments and be like oh why the fuck did i eat so much or like why did i do that and it would be like a purely negative.
[00:39:18.820] 所以，我过去常常回顾那些时刻，然后想，哦，我当时为什么吃了那么多东西，或者我当时为什么做了那样的事，那完全是一种消极的想法。
[00:39:27.780]  moment for me it would almost be like a moment of weakness but a couple months ago james said something like oh i read this study that.
[00:39:27.780] 对我来说，那一刻几乎就像是软弱的时刻，但几个月前，詹姆斯说了类似这样的话：哦，我读过这项研究。
[00:39:36.020]  after you you know say binge or like eat a lot of carbs or something you have like a really good workout the next day.
[00:39:36.020] 比如，在你暴饮暴食或者吃了很多碳水化合物之后，第二天你进行了一次非常棒的锻炼。
[00:39:42.860]  and then i feel like something so simple like that just like completely transformed the ways that i see like those quote unquote.
[00:39:42.860] 然后我觉得像这样简单的事情，就彻底改变了我对那些所谓“事物”的看法。
[00:39:49.260]  moments of weakness where i was like i don't have to see this as like.
[00:39:49.260] 脆弱的时刻，我会想，我不必把这件事看作是这样的。
[00:39:53.580]  Oh why did i binge eat like i shouldn't have done that this was so horrible and shameful i can just see it as like okay well i kind of indulge last night but now i'm going to have like a really good workout at the gym and this is like fuel for my body.
[00:39:53.580] 哦，我为什么会暴饮暴食呢？我不应该那样做，这太可怕、太羞耻了。我现在只能这样想：好吧，我昨晚有点放纵自己了，但我现在要去健身房好好锻炼一下，这就像是给我的身体补充能量。
[00:40:04.900]  and it seems so simple but i feel like it completely changed the way that i look at.
[00:40:04.900] 这看起来很简单，但我觉得它彻底改变了我看待事物的方式。
[00:40:10.100]  food it changed the way that i look at my like late night cravings and.
[00:40:10.100] 食物改变了我看待自己深夜食欲的方式。
[00:40:14.860]  it helps me not like ruin an entire day anymore.
[00:40:14.860] 它能帮我避免再把一整天都毁掉。
[00:40:19.460]  i like so you saw the belief that was making you feel like shit and then you changed it right.
[00:40:19.460] 我喜欢你意识到了让你感觉糟糕的信念，然后改变了它，对吗？
[00:40:25.340]  it's like so simple but also like not you know like you really have to notice those moments of like.
[00:40:25.340] 这感觉很简单，但又不像，你知道，你真的需要注意到那些时刻。
[00:40:35.100]  right and i think in how is that making me feel or how is influencing my life and then like what can i change it to.
[00:40:35.100] 对，我会想，这让我感觉如何？或者说，这对我的生活有什么影响？然后，我可以把它改变成什么样？
[00:40:42.220]  and i feel like also when you look at it the next day and you're like oh my god why do this it's.
[00:40:42.220] 而且我觉得，当你第二天回头看的时候，你会想，哦我的天哪，为什么要这么做？
[00:40:48.780]  in a way taking away from your happy moment earlier to because i'm sure when you're eating the chips you're like oh my god this is fucking delicious like i'm so glad i ate this cuz i really wanted to right.
[00:40:48.780] 某种程度上，这会冲淡你之前的快乐时光，因为我确信当你吃薯片的时候，你会想“哦我的天哪，这太好吃了”，你会想“我很高兴我吃了这个，因为我真的很想吃”，对吧。
[00:40:59.820]  and then the next day are like oh shame on me um like i shouldn't have done that maybe um like recognizing that you're taking away or like you're.
[00:40:59.820] 然后第二天就会想，哦，我真该感到羞愧，嗯，我不应该那样做，也许，嗯，意识到你在夺走什么，或者就像你在……
[00:41:09.660]  almost shaming yourself for being happy is like.
[00:41:09.660] 几乎因为自己感到快乐而感到羞耻，这感觉就像……
[00:41:13.740]  the thing that you need to change.
[00:41:13.740] 你需要改变的事情。
[00:41:16.380]  yeah i think that's a good point i feel like a lot of times there's just like moments in life
[00:41:16.380] 是的，我觉得你说得很有道理。我觉得生活中很多时候都会有那么一些时刻。
[00:41:21.180]  i think one thing that was causing me like really bad anxiety was the way that i was changing those moments.
[00:41:21.180] 我认为让我感到非常焦虑的一件事是，我改变那些时刻的方式。
[00:41:28.460]  and chaining them to like mean something like oh i did this and then i did this so therefore it must mean that.
[00:41:28.460] 并将它们串联起来，表示类似“哦，我做了这个，然后我又做了那个，所以它一定意味着这个”这样的意思。
[00:41:35.180]  mean x about my character or it means that i have no work at the or it means i have no you know self control or whatever.
[00:41:35.180] 这是否意味着我的性格有问题，或者意味着我没有工作，或者意味着我没有自制力等等。
[00:41:41.900]  but i feel like you don't always have to.
[00:41:41.900] 但我感觉你不一定非得这么做。
[00:41:43.900]  affects some sort of like meaning to things like things can just live in like the bubble in the moment
[00:41:43.900] 它对事物产生某种意义上的影响，就像事物可以像泡沫一样在当下短暂存在一样。
[00:41:49.180]  and it doesn't have to be like a whole chain of like okay this sequence of five events means that i'm
[00:41:49.180] 而且它不必像一整串事件那样，比如“好吧，这五个事件的顺序意味着我……”
[00:41:55.260]  this kind of a person i feel like it doesn't have to be so deep sometimes yeah for sure i think that
[00:41:55.260] 我觉得这种人有时候不必那么深奥，是的，我当然这么认为。
[00:42:01.180]  really will fuck you up.
[00:42:01.180] 真的会把你搞得一团糟。
[00:42:04.300]  and like going through a career change and like working kind of in a new career i've definitely had
[00:42:04.300] 就像经历职业转型，从事一份全新的工作一样，我确实有过这样的经历。
[00:42:09.820]  that's moments where i feel like you know an outcome is from a result of like a personal character
[00:42:09.820] 有时候我觉得，你知道，某个结果是由某种个人性格决定的。
[00:42:16.940]  by realize that's entirely not true and because i'm going to like believe that it's not true right.
[00:42:16.940] 因为我意识到这完全不是真的，而且我打算相信这不是真的，对吧。
[00:42:24.220]  so really i think is a decision to to not associate those external events to your internal
[00:42:24.220] 所以，我认为真正的决定是不要将这些外部事件与你的内部事件联系起来。
[00:42:30.940]  character.
[00:42:30.940]  特点。
[00:42:33.180]  i feel like it's still pretty hard though sometimes i still wake up in a cold sweat i'm like
[00:42:33.180] 我觉得还是挺难的，有时候我还是会惊醒，一身冷汗，我就想……
[00:42:37.580]  fuck why did i do that shit 10 years ago.
[00:42:37.580] 操，我十年前为什么要做那种蠢事。
[00:42:41.420]  well what if you believed it was easy?
[00:42:41.420] 如果你认为这很容易呢？
[00:42:44.220]  i guess that's true.
[00:42:44.220] 我想确实如此。
[00:42:46.060]  what feels better believing that it's hard or believing that it's easy?
[00:42:46.060] 相信这件事很难还是相信这件事很容易，哪种感觉更好？
[00:42:51.340]  that's what i'm saying everything is a mind game y'all
[00:42:51.340] 我就是这个意思，一切都是心理战。
[00:42:54.700]  and you got to master your own mind game.
[00:42:54.700] 你必须掌控自己的心理战。
[00:42:57.020]  that's a good point i feel like something that's helped me a lot too is like joking about things
[00:42:57.020] 你说得很有道理，我觉得开玩笑对我也帮助很大。
[00:43:02.460]  or just like trying to take things in a very lighthearted way.
[00:43:02.460] 或者只是想以轻松愉快的方式看待事物。
[00:43:05.580]  like i feel like things that used to feel so cringe and heavy to me like once i joke about it
[00:43:05.580] 感觉以前让我觉得尴尬又沉重的事情，现在我开玩笑说起来好像都变得不再那么尴尬了。
[00:43:10.940]  it's just like a funny story.
[00:43:10.940] 这就像一个有趣的故事。
[00:43:12.780]  now instead of being like oh god i'm such an awkward and cringe person i'm like oh this is
[00:43:12.780] 现在我不再会想“哦天哪，我真是个尴尬又令人难堪的人”，而是会想“哦，这……”
[00:43:17.100]  like another memory i could add to like the story bank of funny stories and it makes things
[00:43:17.100] 就像又多了一段可以添加到我的搞笑故事库里的回忆，这让事情变得更有趣。
[00:43:22.300]  heal so much less heavy.
[00:43:22.300] 愈合过程轻松多了。
[00:43:23.900]  how comedians are born?
[00:43:23.900] 喜剧演员是如何诞生的？
[00:43:25.900]  oh my god
[00:43:25.900]  我的天啊
[00:43:27.980]  future comedian
[00:43:27.980] 未来的喜剧演员
[00:43:30.220]  just working on my set.
[00:43:30.220] 我正在整理我的布景。
[00:43:33.340]  can't wait for you to join Netflix.
[00:43:33.340] 迫不及待想看到你加入 Netflix。
[00:43:36.700]  oh yeah
[00:43:36.700] 哦，是的
[00:43:37.820]  so then do you guys think that having i guess varying levels of confidence in the day-to-day
[00:43:37.820] 那么，你们觉得在日常生活中拥有不同程度的自信会怎么样呢？
[00:43:43.900]  is normal and i guess to what extent does it feel normal to have these swings?
[00:43:43.900] 这是正常的吗？我想知道，这种情绪波动在多大程度上才算正常？
[00:43:49.020]  yeah i feel like it's pretty normal for sure i think confidence can fluctuate depending on
[00:43:49.020] 是的，我觉得这很正常，自信心可能会根据情况而波动。
[00:43:56.220]  like what i'm doing in the moment because kind of like i said in the beginning i associate
[00:43:56.220] 就像我此刻正在做的事情一样，因为就像我一开始说的那样，我会联想到
[00:44:01.180]  confidence more in specific areas versus like the whole.
[00:44:01.180] 对特定领域比对整体更有信心。
[00:44:06.540]  so i think if i'm doing something new sometimes i have a little bit less confidence but there is
[00:44:06.540] 所以我觉得，如果我在做一些新的事情，有时候我会有点缺乏自信，但是……
[00:44:12.860]  the kind of thing that you said gc as well earlier in the episode where like yourself
[00:44:12.860] 就像你之前在节目里说的那样，gc，就像你自己一样。
[00:44:17.420]  esteem backs you up where it's like oh shoot you know i don't know anything about this but
[00:44:17.420] 自尊心会支持你，就像“哦，糟糕，你知道，我对这方面一无所知”一样。
[00:44:22.700]  you know i believe in myself i think i'll be able to catch on so i think like it's pretty normal
[00:44:22.700] 你知道，我相信自己，我觉得我能跟上，所以我觉得这很正常。
[00:44:27.740]  to have like confidence fluctuate depending on what activity you're doing.
[00:44:27.740] 就像自信心会随着你从事的活动而波动一样。
[00:44:32.780]  i think there's like seasons for sure but the important part is what we talked earlier
[00:44:32.780] 我觉得肯定有季节之分，但重要的是我们之前讨论的那部分。
[00:44:37.820]  like how do you kind of combat it or how do you like regain that confidence and that self-esteem
[00:44:37.820] 比如，你如何应对这种情况，或者如何重拾自信和自尊？
[00:44:44.300]  and that makes all the difference.
[00:44:44.300] 这才是关键所在。
[00:44:46.780]  so essentially the recoverability i guess?
[00:44:46.780] 所以本质上是指可恢复性吧？
[00:44:50.140]  yeah the recoverability of your confidence.
[00:44:50.140] 是的，恢复自信心的能力。
[00:44:54.620]  oh this is kind of silly maybe but i think this can really show sometimes in like gaming
[00:44:54.620] 哦，这或许有点傻，但我认为这在游戏领域有时确实会体现出来。
[00:45:01.740]  so one interesting thing i saw was in this one game this professional team they actually have a
[00:45:01.740] 我看到一件很有趣的事情，在这场比赛中，这支职业球队实际上拥有……
[00:45:08.300]  psychologist for their team who helps hype them up he's essentially kind of like their hype man
[00:45:08.300] 他是他们团队的心理学家，负责鼓舞士气，基本上就像他们的气氛担当。
[00:45:15.420]  so in between like these matches or rounds or whatever let's say like they lose the first one
[00:45:15.420] 所以，在这些比赛或回合之间，比如说，他们输掉了第一场。
[00:45:21.260]  the psychologist comes in during the team huddle and he's like hey guys i know we lost that game
[00:45:21.260] 心理学家在球队围成一圈商议的时候进来，他说：“嘿，伙计们，我知道我们输掉了那场比赛。”
[00:45:26.860]  but you're doing so well like you're hitting all your shots the calls that you're making are amazing
[00:45:26.860] 但你做得太棒了，就像百发百中一样，你的判罚简直令人惊叹。
[00:45:32.780]  but the other team just kind of outstratigized us this time but like keep a smile on your face like
[00:45:32.780] 但这次对方的策略比我们更胜一筹，不过还是要保持微笑。
[00:45:38.460]  remember you're so good stop thinking about the other team beating you think more like oh i'm so
[00:45:38.460] 记住你很厉害，别再想着对方会打败你，多想想“哦，我真棒”
[00:45:44.220]  good like focus more on yourself versus like these external things and then after he did that in
[00:45:44.220] 这样做的好处是，他能更专注于自身，而不是关注这些外在事物，然后他这样做之后……
[00:45:49.180]  like the most recent tournament they literally came back and they won the next two matches to win
[00:45:49.180] 就像最近一次锦标赛一样，他们真的逆转取胜，赢得了接下来的两场比赛。
[00:45:54.140]  like the best two out of three so i thought that was like really powerful to see
[00:45:54.140] 就像三局两胜一样，我觉得这真的很震撼。
[00:45:59.340]  yeah the mindset is so key and i think esports and like regular athletes and i heard like one of
[00:45:59.340] 是的，心态非常关键，我认为电子竞技和普通运动员一样，我听说其中一位
[00:46:04.860]  the reasons tennis is really difficult is because you can't talk to like a coach on the on the court
[00:46:04.860] 网球之所以难，是因为你不能像在球场上那样和教练交流。
[00:46:11.260]  so like it just goes to show like how much of a mental game like everything is
[00:46:11.260] 所以这就说明，一切都很大程度上是一场心理战。
[00:46:16.380]  i think the faster your confidence recovery time is the easier time you'll have in life
[00:46:16.380] 我认为，你恢复自信的速度越快，你的生活就会越轻松。
[00:46:22.300]  probably probably yeah yeah like think about it if like someone says something negative about you
[00:46:22.300] 可能，可能，嗯，嗯，想想看，如果有人说了你的坏话呢？
[00:46:28.140]  or like you make a mistake at work think about the difference it would be if it took you a few weeks
[00:46:28.140] 或者，比如你在工作中犯了个错误，想想如果你花几周时间去改正，结果会有什么不同。
[00:46:35.180]  to bounce back versus a few days versus a couple of hours those three instances are completely
[00:46:35.180] 恢复时间与几天、几个小时这三种情况完全不同
[00:46:41.740]  different people essentially true and you're gonna be making different decisions in each of those
[00:46:41.740] 不同的人确实如此，你在每个情况下都会做出不同的决定。
[00:46:46.300]  scenarios going back to esports if you lost that first match and then you felt unsure about your
[00:46:46.300] 回到电子竞技领域，如果你输掉了第一场比赛，然后你对自己的前景感到不确定，这种情况就可能发生。
[00:46:52.540]  decisions the play would be different because you'd be taking different types of risks in those
[00:46:52.540] 比赛的策略会有所不同，因为你在这些比赛中会承担不同类型的风险。
[00:46:57.420]  situations yeah exactly and i feel like this can totally apply to just like regular day-to-day stuff
[00:46:57.420] 没错，这种情况确实如此，我觉得这完全适用于日常生活中的各种琐事。
[00:47:03.980]  too like you don't have to be a pro at anything to like you know try to change this mindset sometimes
[00:47:03.980] 就像你不需要成为任何领域的专家才能尝试改变这种思维方式一样。
[00:47:10.380]  if i'm playing games with friends and then we just like lose a bunch of games we're kind of like okay
[00:47:10.380] 如果我和朋友一起玩游戏，然后我们输了很多局，我们就会觉得“好吧”。
[00:47:15.660]  you know it let's just like step away for tonight like that's good for tonight we'll do a mental
[00:47:15.660] 你知道，我们今晚就先休息一下吧，这样就好，我们今晚就做个心理练习。
[00:47:19.420]  resale play again tomorrow we'll be happy no need to like try to chase that win oh my god actually
[00:47:19.420] 明天再玩转盘，我们会很高兴的，没必要费劲去追那场胜利，我的天哪！
[00:47:26.220]  this has happened to us in college me jisu and our other college friends sometimes we would play like
[00:47:26.220] 这事儿在我们大学的时候也发生过，我和智秀还有其他大学朋友有时候会玩这种游戏。
[00:47:32.540]  league we'd be like oh shoo we keep losing like we can't end on a loss like we have to keep playing
[00:47:32.540] 联赛里我们会想，哎呀，我们老是输，好像不能以失败告终，好像我们必须继续玩下去。
[00:47:38.140]  to you but sometimes like you're just on a like losing streak and you just can't help it right so
[00:47:38.140] 对你来说，但有时候就像你运气不好，连连失利，你也没办法，对吧？
[00:47:45.100]  sometimes we would end up playing until like five a.m. or something and we're just like oh man
[00:47:45.100] 有时候我们会一直玩到凌晨五点左右，然后我们就觉得，哎呀，真是的。
[00:47:50.940]  like why do we do that yeah in the end it's like oh why do we do that we could have easily
[00:47:50.940] 就像，我们为什么要那样做？是啊，到最后你会想，哦，我们为什么要那样做？我们本来可以很容易地……
[00:47:56.700]  just like stepped away and just had a great time the next day there's this woman called abraham
[00:47:56.700] 就像我突然离开，第二天过得很开心一样，有个叫亚伯拉罕的女人。
[00:48:02.460]  hicks um and she talks about like how you have like negative momentum and pause the momentum
[00:48:02.460] 希克斯，嗯，她谈到了你如何拥有负动量并暂停动量。
[00:48:09.740]  and when you have negative momentum and you can literally like you can't stop those feelings of
[00:48:09.740] 当你陷入负面情绪，而且你真的无法阻止那种感觉时，
[00:48:14.540]  negativity or those thoughts and negativity she's like yo just like go to fucking bed you know
[00:48:14.540] 她总是说些消极的话，或者那些消极的想法，就好像在说“去他妈的睡觉吧，你知道吗？”
[00:48:18.700]  tomorrow's a new day yeah sometimes it's just too hard to stop that negative momentum
[00:48:18.700] 明天又是新的一天，是啊，有时候真的很难阻止那种负面情绪的蔓延。
[00:48:24.460]  no for real like just don't like tomorrow you will actually feel better so I felt like that was
[00:48:24.460] 不，真的，就像别说了，明天你就会感觉好多了，所以我感觉就是这样。
[00:48:30.780]  a really good example of that oh my god yes i think that is so true like honestly it's okay to stop
[00:48:30.780] 真是个很好的例子，我的天哪，是的，我觉得说得太对了，真的，停下来也没关系。
[00:48:36.860]  sometimes and just be like let me just take a reset like a break or whatever true this is not the
[00:48:36.860] 有时候，我只想说，让我休息一下，重新调整一下，或者别的什么都行。这确实不是……
[00:48:42.940]  momentum and i think that applies to thoughts also when you're in like this crazy like spiral
[00:48:42.940] 惯性，我认为这同样适用于思维，尤其是在你陷入这种疯狂的漩涡时。
[00:48:48.620]  or like negative thought mindset sometimes it's really hard to shift that and it's better should
[00:48:48.620] 或者像消极的思维模式，有时候真的很难改变，最好还是……
[00:48:53.340]  just do something to completely take it off your mind right or to just sleep it off go to bed
[00:48:53.340] 做点什么彻底分散注意力，或者干脆睡一觉，然后去睡觉。
[00:48:59.740]  and realize that like tomorrow you can like start a new with these feelings and thoughts of like
[00:48:59.740] 并意识到，就像明天一样，你可以带着这些感受和想法重新开始。
[00:49:05.740]  self-esteem and confidence yeah like sometimes even at work if i'm feeling like really confused
[00:49:05.740] 自尊和自信，嗯，有时候即使在工作中，如果我感到非常困惑，也会有这种感觉。
[00:49:13.820]  or like down about a project or something i'll just be like fuck it like i'll just take an early
[00:49:13.820] 或者像我遇到某个项目或什么事，心情低落的时候，我就会想，算了，我干脆提前结束吧。
[00:49:18.780]  lunch you know just like go distract myself feel happy after eating then come back and be like okay
[00:49:18.780] 你知道，午饭的时候，我就是想找点事做，让自己放松一下，吃完饭后心情会很好，然后回来就觉得一切都好了。
[00:49:25.020]  well you know restart this or whatever totally i feel like sometimes when i'm in that negative
[00:49:25.020] 你知道，重新开始或者其他什么，有时候我感觉当我情绪低落的时候，完全是这样。
[00:49:30.940]  thought spiral though i'll like have a conversation with james and then i realized like how bad the
[00:49:30.940] 思绪陷入漩涡，我想和詹姆斯聊聊，然后我意识到情况有多糟糕……
[00:49:35.740]  spiral was it really truly takes like an external source for me personally because i'm kind of like
[00:49:35.740] 螺旋式上升对我个人而言真的需要外部因素的介入，因为我有点像……
[00:49:41.180]  an external thinker i have to be able to bounce my ideas off of someone recently i was having this
[00:49:41.180] 我是一个外向型思考者，我需要能够与别人交流我的想法。最近我就遇到了这个问题。
[00:49:46.700]  negative thought spiral about something at work and i was like oh my god can't believe this happened
[00:49:46.700] 工作上某件事让我陷入了消极的思维漩涡，我当时就想，天哪，真不敢相信会发生这种事。
[00:49:50.860]  what am i gonna do you know and i was just kind of going down this list of this person will be
[00:49:50.860] 我该怎么办？你知道，我当时就一直在想，这个人会是……
[00:49:55.660]  negatively affected and like this will happen and this is like a whole list of like negative things
[00:49:55.660] 会受到负面影响，比如会发生这种情况，这简直就是一长串负面事件。
[00:50:00.540]  essentially and james was like dude who cares like mistakes happen all the time other people make
[00:50:00.540] 詹姆斯基本上就是说，老兄，谁在乎啊，犯错是常有的事，其他人也会犯错。
[00:50:05.900]  mistakes you make mistakes it's like completely normal and it doesn't have to negatively affect
[00:50:05.900] 犯错是人之常情，完全正常，不一定会产生负面影响。
[00:50:11.260]  your like personal life basically like we're like negatively affect the way you see yourself as a person
[00:50:11.260] 你的个人生活基本上会对你如何看待自己产生负面影响。
[00:50:16.940]  i feel like when i talk to someone really positive i'm always like mind blown by the way that
[00:50:16.940] 我觉得每次和特别积极的人聊天，我都会被他们那种积极乐观的态度深深震撼。
[00:50:21.100]  they're able to think about life because with james specifically i mean you guys know so well but
[00:50:21.100] 他们能够思考人生，尤其是詹姆斯，我的意思是，你们都非常了解他。
[00:50:26.300]  we've talked about on this podcast about how he celebrates his wins really big and he's like not very
[00:50:26.300] 我们在播客里聊过他庆祝胜利的方式，他庆祝得非常隆重，但他本人却不太……
[00:50:33.180]  impacted by the losses that he goes through in life that's something that i try to think about a lot
[00:50:33.180] 他的人生经历中的种种失去对他的影响，是我经常思考的问题。
[00:50:38.060]  like i'm always trying to channel like my inner male energy in the sense of like how do a guy go
[00:50:38.060] 我总是试图引导我内心的男性能量，比如，一个男人该如何……
[00:50:43.820]  about oh my gosh so i talked about this with my friend all the time because we have this mutual
[00:50:43.820] 天哪，我一直跟我朋友聊这个，因为我们有共同的感受。
[00:50:48.940]  friend we're both like Asian women and we have this white male friend and he's just so damn confident
[00:50:48.940] 朋友，我们俩都是亚裔女性，我们有个白人男性朋友，他超级自信。
[00:50:55.260]  we're like holy shit this is how he gets things like things that he wants in his life and we're always
[00:50:55.260] 我们当时就想，我的天哪，原来他就是这样得到他想要的东西的，我们总是
[00:51:00.540]  like yo we got a channel his energy let's be white men no no inner white men yeah we are inner white
[00:51:00.540] 就像我们有个频道，他的能量，让我们做白人，不，不，内在的白人，是的，我们就是内在的白人
[00:51:09.580]  wait i saw the funniest tiktok the other day which is kind of in line with this this girl she asks
[00:51:09.580] 等等，我前几天看到一个超搞笑的TikTok视频，跟这个有点类似，这个女孩问……
[00:51:15.340]  like oh what would you wish for if there was a genie but you can't wish for like more money
[00:51:15.340] 比如说，如果真有神灯精灵，你会许什么愿？但你不能许愿要更多的钱。
[00:51:21.500]  and then this one girl was like oh i would wish for whatever i wanted to happen to happen
[00:51:21.500] 然后有个女孩说，哦，我希望任何我想做的事情都能发生。
[00:51:27.260]  basically right and then everyone's like oh that's pretty good and then her friend suddenly goes
[00:51:27.260] 基本上是对的，然后大家都说哦，这很不错，然后她的朋友突然说
[00:51:31.660]  oh wait no like there's one problem like don't you sometimes wish that you were dead that would happen
[00:51:31.660] 哦等等，不对，好像有个问题，比如，你难道有时候不希望自己死了吗？这种情况会发生。
[00:51:37.020]  right and then she was like no like i've never thought about that i was like wait that's so crazy
[00:51:37.020] 对，然后她又说，不，我从来没想过这一点，我就想，等等，这也太疯狂了吧
[00:51:45.020]  all the comments were like why did i relate to the friend who said what if you wish you were dead
[00:51:45.020] 所有评论都像是在问：为什么我会对那个问“如果你希望自己死了怎么办”的朋友感同身受
[00:51:50.540]  and not the one who was like so innocently like i've never thought that before
[00:51:50.540] 而不是那个一脸无辜地说“我以前从来没想过这个问题”的人
[00:51:54.940]  oh my god dude but yeah the fucking white male energy is hard to beat like i've worked with some
[00:51:54.940] 我的天啊兄弟，没错，白人男性的能量真的很难战胜，就像我曾经和一些白人男性共事过一样。
[00:52:01.660]  pretty interesting people but i try to look at like their qualities of like what put them in that
[00:52:01.660] 这些人挺有意思的，但我更倾向于关注他们的特质，以及是什么让他们走到今天这一步。
[00:52:08.860]  place and a lot of times it's just straight up like confidence like can you not it's not even like
[00:52:08.860] 很多时候，这完全就是自信作祟，就像“你能不能别这样？”这根本不是……
[00:52:14.540]  how good they are at their job it's literally because they like believe that they can and i'm like
[00:52:14.540] 他们工作做得这么好，完全是因为他们相信自己能做到，而我则觉得……
[00:52:20.540]  i know and it's totally that mindset of like i've never understood when people are like oh if you
[00:52:20.540] 我知道，这完全就是那种心态，我一直不理解为什么有人会说“哦，如果你……”
[00:52:27.100]  want something just like ask for it i'm like what do you mean like that goes against every fiber of
[00:52:27.100] 想要什么东西就直接说出来，我就会想，你什么意思？这完全违背了我的原则。
[00:52:31.820]  my fucking being oh my god but then i feel like in professional settings or just in life on
[00:52:31.820] 我的天啊，我的天哪，但后来我觉得在职业场合或者生活中……
[00:52:37.580]  fucking linked infeeds you see that manifestation or like you see what that does for people and i'm
[00:52:37.580] 看看那些链接信息流，你就会明白那种现象，或者说，你就会明白它对人们的影响，而我……
[00:52:43.660]  like maybe i should just do that like just ask for shit that i want crazy idea but i think a lot
[00:52:43.660] 或许我应该就这么做，直接开口要我想要的东西，这想法虽然疯狂，但我确实想了很多。
[00:52:49.900]  of it comes back down to like truly that like self esteem or like confidence or the way you
[00:52:49.900] 归根结底，这真的取决于自尊、自信或者你的态度。
[00:52:56.140]  see yourself or the way you see what you deserve almost it's like there's this phrase in
[00:52:56.140] 看待自己，或者说看待自己应得之物的方式，几乎就像有这么一句谚语说的那样。
[00:53:00.860]  Korean where it talks about like your kudit which is like your dish it's like your dish is really big
[00:53:00.860] 韩语里提到“你的菜”（kudit）的时候，会说你的菜真的很大。
[00:53:06.220]  which means you're like able to receive things or like you're able to like receive or like call out
[00:53:06.220] 这意味着你能够接收东西，或者能够接收或呼喊。
[00:53:12.140]  or like handle bigger things if you're like dishes bigger and i feel like i need to constantly
[00:53:12.140] 或者说，处理更大的事情，比如更大的碗碟，我觉得我需要不断地……
[00:53:18.140]  think about like making my dish bigger and bigger i really like that phrase slash analogy
[00:53:18.140] 想想看，就像把我的菜越做越大一样，我真的很喜欢这个短语/比喻。
[00:53:25.260]  because it's so true like if you don't believe your worthy of it then you're not gonna get it right
[00:53:25.260] 因为这是真的，如果你不相信自己配得上，那你就永远也做不到。
[00:53:29.500]  even if someone hands it to you on a platter you're gonna be like oh shit i can't handle this or like
[00:53:29.500] 即使有人把东西送到你面前，你也会觉得“哦，糟了，我应付不了”或者类似这样
[00:53:34.300]  oh wait i'm actually not good enough for this and like you're gonna push it away so i feel like
[00:53:34.300] 哦等等，我其实不够格，而且你好像要把它推开，所以我感觉……
[00:53:38.700]  a lot of the core is working on like yourself worthiness yeah oh my god i attended this woman's
[00:53:38.700] 很多核心内容都与提升自我价值感有关，是的，我的天哪，我参加了这位女士的课程。
[00:53:45.340]  panel at work once and they talked about how a lot of women see a job description and they want
[00:53:45.340] 我曾经参加过一个工作小组讨论，他们谈到很多女性看到职位描述后会想……
[00:53:53.340]  to feel like they fulfill 90 to 100 percent of the job description before they apply but men
[00:53:53.340] 男性在申请前会觉得自己符合职位描述的90%到100%的要求。
[00:54:02.700]  see like 10 percent and they're like okay i'm applying oh my god yeah or it's like some crazy
[00:54:02.700] 看到大概10%的人申请，他们就会想：好吧，我要申请了，天哪，太好了！或者就像是某种疯狂的申请。
[00:54:06.940]  like low number you know and they'll just be like okay you know what i have like one or two of these
[00:54:06.940] 就像数量很少那样，你知道，他们就会说，好吧，你知道吗，我只有一两个这样的
[00:54:11.820]  things so fuck i'll just apply and so on that panel they were like yeah we encourage you to think
[00:54:11.820] 事情就是这样，我干脆就申请吧。在那个小组里，他们说，是的，我们鼓励你思考。
[00:54:16.460]  of more like men like fuck it dude just apply so true like channel your inner white man
[00:54:16.460] 更像是男人会说“去他妈的，兄弟，直接上手吧”，这话说得太对了，就像释放你内心的白人男性气质一样。
[00:54:24.860]  but it is so fucking true holy shit i guess that is like generations of destroying our self-esteem
[00:54:24.860] 但说得太对了，我的天哪，我想这就像是几代人以来对我们自尊心的摧残。
[00:54:34.380]  yeah totally time for that reversal yeah
[00:54:34.380] 是的，是时候做出改变了。
[00:54:37.340]  yeah
[00:54:37.340]  是的
[00:54:38.380]  sometimes when i'm in those moments of like hesitation of like oh do i ask for this or do not or like
[00:54:38.380] 有时候，当我犹豫不决，比如“哦，我该不该提这个要求”的时候，或者“不该提这个要求”的时候，
[00:54:44.380]  do i you know talk to this person or not i think of like the people in my life who are super
[00:54:44.380] 我到底要不要跟这个人说话？我心里想着，就像我生命中那些超级棒的人一样。
[00:54:51.100]  confident and if they would do it or not and how they would approach it go like okay if i'm this
[00:54:51.100] 自信，以及他们是否会去做，以及他们会如何处理，比如，好吧，如果我是这个
[00:54:55.660]  person like how would i go about it and that is super helpful because removing what i think of myself
[00:54:55.660] 比如，如果有人问我该怎么做，这真的很有帮助，因为这样可以消除我对自己的固有看法。
[00:55:02.780]  from the situation and being like who is like someone that i admire or that i would
[00:55:02.780] 从这种情况来看，我会想，像我钦佩的人或者我会……
[00:55:08.460]  want to be in terms of confidence like what would they do in that situation
[00:55:08.460] 想了解他们在那种情况下会怎么做，以及他们的自信心。
[00:55:12.460]  ultimately if i want to get there like i would have to do the same thing you know
[00:55:12.460] 最终，如果我想达到那个目标，我也得做同样的事情，你知道的。
[00:55:17.260]  it takes a bit of time to i think cultivate that readiness but like once you do reach that point
[00:55:17.260] 我认为培养这种准备状态需要一些时间，但一旦你达到那个状态……
[00:55:23.820]  like it's up to you to take that action for sure that's that's like such a crazy concept
[00:55:23.820] 好像采取行动完全取决于你自己，这真是个疯狂的想法。
[00:55:29.100]  i think i do something similar where i'm like what would this person do but i never thought about
[00:55:29.100] 我觉得我也会做类似的事情，比如我会想这个人会怎么做，但我从来没认真想过。
[00:55:33.900]  it as a way of like removing myself from the situation and it's really interesting because
[00:55:33.900] 这让我感觉像是从那种情境中抽身出来，这真的很有意思，因为
[00:55:39.660]  it kind of to me points to like how much we or at least i let myself or the way that i perceive
[00:55:39.660] 对我来说，这在某种程度上表明了我们，或者至少是我，允许自己在多大程度上放纵自己，或者说我看待事物的方式。
[00:55:47.660]  myself like guide my decisions but when you think about it like the difference between you and
[00:55:47.660] 我自己喜欢引导我的决定，但当你仔细想想，你和别人之间的区别是什么？
[00:55:53.900]  like the person that you respect the most is not that big i mean yes like the cultural background
[00:55:53.900] 比如你最尊敬的人，其实没那么重要，我的意思是，比如文化背景。
[00:55:59.740]  like the context the history of your life all of that yes yes yes but at the end of the day
[00:55:59.740] 比如你的人生背景、经历等等，没错没错没错，但归根结底……
[00:56:04.700]  the decision making is still like the same it's like a choice and it's crazy to think that it's
[00:56:04.700] 决策过程仍然和以前一样，仍然是一种选择，想到这一点真是令人难以置信。
[00:56:10.140]  because i'm there that i choose to do these things but if i channel someone else like my decision
[00:56:10.140] 因为我身处其中，所以我选择做这些事，但如果我像其他人一样做出决定，我的选择也会随之改变。
[00:56:16.300]  making is way significantly different exactly if you think about like you versus like someone else
[00:56:16.300] 如果你从自己的角度思考，和从别人的角度思考，那么创作的意义就截然不同了。
[00:56:22.700]  it's literally all those decisions and there's this thing called like quantum leaping in the personal
[00:56:22.700] 实际上，所有这些决定都与个人层面的量子跃迁有关。
[00:56:29.340]  development world and it's basically like if you are here at what you perceive as point a and you
[00:56:29.340] 发展领域，基本上就像你身处你所认为的A点，而你
[00:56:34.460]  want to be at point the this i don't know super successful blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you need
[00:56:34.460] 想达到那种程度，我不知道，超级成功，等等等等，你需要
[00:56:41.180]  to think about what that person would be doing and thinking and acting and literally do what that
[00:56:41.180] 思考那个人会做什么、想什么、采取什么行动，然后真的去做。
[00:56:47.020]  person is doing you will get there way faster than like if you tried really hard essentially
[00:56:47.020] 这个人正在做的，会让你比自己非常努力地尝试更快地达到目标。
[00:56:54.540]  you with like your current thoughts and perceptions and beliefs would have to take a lot of time
[00:56:54.540] 改变你目前的想法、认知和信念需要很长时间。
[00:57:01.900]  and effort to get over there versus if you change your thoughts and beliefs and whatever first
[00:57:01.900] 努力到达那里与改变你的想法和信仰等等相比，首先……
[00:57:07.500]  you'd make totally different decisions that would then get you there a lot faster hence the quantum leap
[00:57:07.500] 你会做出完全不同的决定，从而更快地到达目的地，这就是所谓的量子飞跃。
[00:57:13.740]  yeah that makes total sense and it's basically what you said earlier right like kind of brainwashing
[00:57:13.740] 是的，这完全说得通，基本上跟你之前说的一样，有点像洗脑。
[00:57:17.900]  yourself into being like i'm this other person i'm you know this pro surfer or whatever and this is
[00:57:17.900] 让自己变成另一个人，比如，你知道，一个职业冲浪运动员什么的，而这……
[00:57:24.140]  how they would think this is like what i need to be doing kind of goes back to like what Jesus was
[00:57:24.140] 他们会觉得这就是我应该做的，这其实可以追溯到耶稣的教导。
[00:57:29.180]  saying earlier it's like okay you have like you and then you have like your personality or like
[00:57:29.180] 就像之前说的，好吧，你有你自己，然后你还有你的个性或者类似的东西
[00:57:34.940]  your perception of yourself once you realize that that personality and perception of yourself
[00:57:34.940] 一旦你意识到那种性格和自我认知，你对自己的看法就会改变。
[00:57:41.260]  is completely mutable and it's actually you the real use decision how to mute change that
[00:57:41.260] 完全可变，实际上如何静音更改的真正决定权在你手中。
[00:57:47.580]  then you're like oh fuck i can be anyone yeah and like it becomes more of like fun and less burden
[00:57:47.580] 然后你就会想，哦，天哪，我可以成为任何人，是啊，然后事情就变得更有趣，负担也减轻了。
[00:57:54.220]  some process right compared to completely enveloping yourself into this thought of who you think you
[00:57:54.220] 与完全沉浸在你认为自己是谁的想法中相比，某些过程是正确的。
[00:58:00.700]  are true you take off a lot of those limiters yeah like if you are really wrapped up into some idea
[00:58:00.700] 没错，你确实可以解除很多限制，比如如果你真的全身心投入到某个想法中。
[00:58:08.780]  i'll give a personal example like if i think that i've been doing marketing my whole life i'm just
[00:58:08.780] 我举个自己的例子，比如，如果我认为自己一辈子都在从事市场营销，那我只是……
[00:58:15.020]  the marketer you know like this perception limits me to this ability to do this one thing versus all
[00:58:15.020] 你知道，这种营销人员的认知会限制我的能力，让我只能做这一件事，而不能做其他所有事。
[00:58:21.740]  the other things i could do writing entrepreneurship are all this kind of stuff and i even feel this way
[00:58:21.740] 写作、创业等等，我还能做很多类似的事情，我甚至有这种感觉。
[00:58:27.180]  with identifying myself as an artist then i'm like but what if i want to make music like what if i
[00:58:27.180] 如果我把自己定义为艺术家，我就会想，但如果我想创作音乐呢？如果我……
[00:58:33.260]  want to write a book that's why i see these self perceptions not as like permanent things but ways
[00:58:33.260] 我想写一本书，所以我不把这些自我认知看作是永久不变的东西，而是方式。
[00:58:40.780]  i can like position myself into different avenues almost yeah and i feel like there's just so much
[00:58:40.780] 我几乎可以把自己定位在不同的领域，是的，我觉得有很多选择。
[00:58:49.420]  power in the way that you see choices too like this is gonna sound so stupid but there's this influencer
[00:58:49.420] 权力体现在你看待选择的方式上，这听起来可能很蠢，但确实有这么一位网红。
[00:58:55.260]  named nara smith who's been blowing up on tiktok and i think she's like a moreman influencer maybe
[00:58:55.260] 一个叫娜拉·史密斯的人，最近在TikTok上爆红，我觉得她有点像个网红。
[00:59:02.220]  but basically what she's known for is like these videos where she makes things from scratch so one of the
[00:59:02.220] 但她最出名的就是那些她从零开始制作东西的视频，所以其中一个
[00:59:07.340]  videos that really hooked me in was she was like oh my toddler said that they wanted cereal this morning
[00:59:07.340] 真正吸引我的视频是，她会说：“哦，我家宝宝今天早上说想吃麦片。”
[00:59:13.580]  so i'm gonna make some cereal from scratch i don't know why but that like fucking blew my mind
[00:59:13.580] 所以我打算自己做点麦片，我也不知道为什么，但这真的让我大吃一惊。
[00:59:20.540]  i can't believe you can just choose to make cereal from scratch and as stupid as that sounds
[00:59:20.540] 我简直不敢相信你可以选择自己从头开始做麦片，虽然这听起来很蠢。
[00:59:25.900]  i felt like it opened my eyes to like am i sometimes living my life as a consumer of goods rather than
[00:59:25.900] 我觉得它让我大开眼界，让我意识到我有时是否像个消费者一样生活，而不是像个消费者一样生活。
[00:59:32.620]  like a living person because i feel like being able to make your own cereal is a completely
[00:59:32.620] 就像一个活生生的人一样，因为我觉得能够自己制作麦片完全是一种……
[00:59:38.860]  valid choice that anyone can just wake up and like think that way but i've just i feel like my brain
[00:59:38.860] 这是一种合理的选择，任何人都可以醒来后就这么想，但我感觉我的大脑……
[00:59:44.220]  is wired to not think oh should i make my cereal this morning or should i eat koko povs like my
[00:59:44.220] 我的思维模式决定了我不会去想“哦，我今天早上该不该吃麦片”或者“我该不该吃可可视角之类的东西”。
[00:59:49.180]  brain is wired to think should i eat koko povs or should i eat organic cereal or should i eat
[00:59:49.180] 大脑的运作机制决定了我应该吃可可豆片，还是应该吃有机谷物，或者我应该吃……
[00:59:53.900]  like what am i consuming or like choosing to purchase almost it's like small things like that where
[00:59:53.900] 比如我正在消费什么，或者我选择购买什么，几乎就是诸如此类的小事。
[00:59:58.940]  i'm just like suddenly so vividly aware of my ability to decide things for myself but i feel like
[00:59:58.940] 我突然间如此清晰地意识到自己有能力为自己做决定，但我感觉……
[01:00:05.580]  you know it's good to have reminders like that and i think it's one of those things where once you
[01:00:05.580] 你知道，有这样的提醒是件好事，而且我觉得这是那种一旦你……
[01:00:09.820]  see it out in the wild you're like able to notice it more and other things but i do want to kind of
[01:00:09.820] 在野外看到它，你会更容易注意到它和其他一些东西，但我确实想……
[01:00:14.860]  ask a final question for you guys since we are coming to the end of time when do you feel the most
[01:00:14.860] 最后一个问题，既然我们即将走到尽头，你们什么时候感觉最……
[01:00:22.860]  confident for me i don't think there's a specific moment in time it's literally when i make those
[01:00:22.860] 对我来说，自信并没有什么特定的时间点，它实际上就是我创作那些作品的时候。
[01:00:29.900]  internal choices to like think differently or like you know what we were talking about negative
[01:00:29.900] 内在的选择，比如不同的思考方式，或者你知道我们刚才在说什么的负面情绪。
[01:00:34.780]  momentum before when i'm in positive momentum and i just keep building it yeah so i think those
[01:00:34.780] 之前我处于上升势头的时候，我会不断积累势头，是的，所以我认为那些
[01:00:41.820]  moments are really clear and like sometimes it's easier in meditation because you intentionally
[01:00:41.820] 有些时刻非常清晰，有时候冥想会更容易一些，因为你是有意识地……
[01:00:47.580]  quiet your mind and usually when you quiet your mind you automatically feel better because a lot
[01:00:47.580] 让你的思绪平静下来，通常当你平静下来时，你会自然而然地感觉好一些，因为很多
[01:00:53.420]  of our internal dialogues are skewed towards the negative due to conditioning yeah so it's that
[01:00:53.420] 由于后天环境的影响，我们的内心对话往往偏向负面，是的，就是这样。
[01:00:59.660]  combined with quite the negative thoughts and that combined with thinking new thoughts i do want to
[01:00:59.660] 再加上一些消极的想法，以及想要思考新想法的想法，我确实想……
[01:01:04.780]  think that kind of channel this confidence so i would say those scenarios and also like when i
[01:01:04.780] 我认为那种渠道能增强这种自信，所以我会说那些情况，还有像当我
[01:01:10.300]  actually act upon something that was a difficult decision before and i'm like holy shit i actually
[01:01:10.300] 真正付诸行动，去做之前觉得很难决定的事情，我当时就想，我的天哪，我真的做到了
[01:01:15.660]  did it you know wow i feel like i feel the most confident when i am doing something that is very
[01:01:15.660] 你知道吗，我做到了！哇，我觉得当我做一些非常……的事情时，我感觉自己最有自信。
[01:01:26.300]  true to myself like it is something that is allowing me to live my life versus like living
[01:01:26.300] 忠于自我，就像它让我能够真正地生活，而不是仅仅活着。
[01:01:33.580]  someone else's expectation of my life i guess it's when i feel like i have full autonomy
[01:01:33.580] 我想，当我感觉自己拥有完全自主权时，就能摆脱别人对我生活的期望。
[01:01:41.020]  i'm feeling very confident because it's like yeah this is something i want to do of course i'm
[01:01:41.020] 我感觉非常有信心，因为我觉得，没错，这正是我想要做的事情，我当然想这么做。
[01:01:46.300]  gonna do it and i'm gonna feel great that i'm doing it regardless of how tough it might be
[01:01:46.300] 我打算去做，而且无论有多难，我都会为自己能做到这一点而感到自豪。
[01:01:52.460]  oh hmm i think mine is somewhat similar to that but in a different lens so i definitely feel the
[01:01:52.460] 哦，嗯，我觉得我的情况跟那个有点类似，只是镜头不一样，所以我肯定能感觉到……
[01:01:59.900]  most confident when day-to-day i'm making choices that build myself up choices that i think will
[01:01:59.900] 当我每天都做出能提升自己的选择，做出我认为会让自己变得强大的选择时，我最有自信。
[01:02:06.940]  positively impact me whether that's short-term or long-term sticking to those choices and building
[01:02:06.940] 坚持这些选择并建立这些信念，无论短期还是长期，都会对我产生积极影响。
[01:02:13.500]  positive habits like i think those are moments where i learned to trust myself a little bit
[01:02:13.500] 我认为，像这些积极习惯这样的时刻，让我学会了稍微信任自己。
[01:02:20.140]  trust that i'm able to make these decisions for myself and that's when i have like the strongest
[01:02:20.140] 相信我有能力自己做出这些决定，而这正是我最强大的地方。
[01:02:27.180]  bond with myself i love it all well thank you i for coming on today and chatting with us about
[01:02:27.180] 与自己建立联系，我喜欢这一切，非常感谢你今天来和我们聊天。
[01:02:35.980]  self-esteem confidence self-value all of that stuff i feel like it was very interesting and insightful
[01:02:35.980] 自尊、自信、自我价值等等，我觉得这些都非常有趣且富有启发性。
