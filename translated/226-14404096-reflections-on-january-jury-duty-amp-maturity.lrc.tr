[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal All right, so we have a slang word today I don't know if we should still call them Gen Z words because
[00:00:00.050] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。好的，今天我们要学习一个俚语。我不知道我们是否还应该称它们为Z世代词汇，因为
[00:00:23.270] What is it like Gen Alpha is on the come up for something and some of these words are also started by them But we do have a word today but we also wanted to ask our listeners if you all like the
[00:00:23.270] 阿尔法世代正在崛起，他们创造了一些词汇，我们今天确实有一个词要讲，但我们也想问问听众朋友们是否喜欢……
[00:00:37.230] Slang word of the week since we're in the new year. We're still playing around a bit with our themes and Structures, so if you like it and want us to keep doing it
[00:00:37.230] 新年伊始，本周的俚语是：我们还在尝试不同的主题和结构，如果你喜欢并希望我们继续这样做，请告诉我们。
[00:00:47.870] Let us know we'll put up a poll in Spotify and we'll probably put up a poll on our Instagram as well So the word that Jeesoo actually brought today is Yap slash yapping slash yapper. I
[00:00:47.870] 请告诉我们，我们会在Spotify上发起投票，可能也会在Instagram上发起投票。所以Jeesoo今天带来的词是Yap/yapping/yapper。
[00:01:02.590] Think that's such a funny word too because as you've said before Jeesoo like this is a real word If you look in the dictionary, this is a legitimate word It's not really slang in its origin But it's been really popular lately
[00:01:02.590] 我也觉得这个词很有趣，因为就像你之前说的，Jeesoo，这真的是个词。如果你查字典，就会发现它是个正规的词。它原本并不是俚语，但最近却非常流行。
[00:01:18.990] I've been seeing it on tik-tok a lot mostly in the comments, dude Yeah, the comments on tik-tok are so savage sometimes especially when it comes to the usage of this word
[00:01:18.990] 我最近在TikTok上经常看到这个词，主要是在评论里，老兄。是啊，TikTok上的评论有时候真的太狠了，尤其是在用这个词的时候。
[00:01:27.870] Because I feel like they do not hold back and they will make fun of you for yapping. Oh my god So the definition of the word is pretty True to its actual meaning which is talking a lot, but it's definitely a lot more negative of a context
[00:01:27.870] 因为我觉得他们说话毫不留情，会嘲笑你喋喋不休。我的天哪！所以这个词的定义其实很贴切，就是话多，但它的语境肯定更负面一些。
[00:01:44.990] So on know your meme, I thought this about description was so funny It says the concept of yapping or someone yapping Became a tik-tok meme and it's a way to lightheartedly demean someone's opinions or Alternatively highlight a creators tendency to talk too much
[00:01:44.990] 在Know Your Meme网站上，我看到一段关于“喋喋不休”的描述，觉得特别搞笑。它说“喋喋不休”这个概念或者某人喋喋不休的行为，在TikTok上成了一个梗，用来轻松嘲讽别人的观点，或者反过来，也用来讽刺某个创作者话太多的毛病。
[00:02:05.510] I've also seen variations of this as with all slang I guess but sometimes if There's someone on tik-tok and they're doing like a story time video, for example, but it goes on for a really long time They're adding all these unnecessary details
[00:02:05.510] 我也见过类似的情况，我想所有俚语都是如此。比如，有人在TikTok上做故事视频，但视频时间很长，他们就会添加很多不必要的细节。
[00:02:19.230] Then the comments will always be like Oh bros a professional yapper or like bros fluent in Japanese Holy shit, dude. We've evolved. I'm just being like this is too wordy. It's like yeah to insult them this way The Japanese is so funny Too good
[00:02:19.230] 然后评论总是会是“哦兄弟，专业话痨”或者“兄弟，日语真流利，我的天，老兄。我们都进化了。我只是觉得这样太啰嗦了。就像是，用这种方式侮辱他们，日本人真搞笑，太逗了。”
[00:02:36.750] Yeah, I think it's nice though because the word itself doesn't feel very mean that's true It does kind of maintain that more light-hearted tone I think at least so I feel like when I see it used I can like get on board with it cuz I'm like
[00:02:36.750] 是啊，我觉得挺好的，因为这个词本身听起来并不刻薄，确实如此。它确实保持了一种比较轻松愉快的语气，至少我是这么觉得的。所以我觉得当我看到它被使用时，我也能接受，因为我会想：
[00:02:51.710] Oh, this is kind of funny. It's not too crazy Like no one's getting really hurt and usually people who get called yappers They kind of make fun of themselves to a little bit. They're like, oh, yeah
[00:02:51.710] 哦，这有点搞笑。也没那么离谱，没人真的受伤，而且通常被叫做“话痨”的人，他们自己也会有点自嘲的意思。他们会说，哦，是啊
[00:03:01.670] I know I kind of just like talk about nothing for hours or whatever And I've actually heard this word used in real life as well So some of our friends actually say it the first time I heard it was in the context of someone who got
[00:03:01.670] 我知道我有点喜欢没完没了地闲聊几个小时什么的。而且我确实在现实生活中也听到过这个词。我们的一些朋友会这么说。我第一次听到这个词是在某人……的语境下。
[00:03:14.230] Pretty drunk one night and then they were talking a lot in the car about like random bullshit Basically, we're like, you know, people are drunk and they're just like saying stuff, but it doesn't make any sense Yeah
[00:03:14.230] 那天晚上他们喝得有点醉，然后在车里胡扯了一大堆。基本上，我们当时就觉得，你知道，他们喝醉了，就胡说八道，但根本没意义。是啊。
[00:03:24.390] But we were just like recounting what we witnessed that night and then my friend was just like oh my god This person would not stop yapping. Oh and I feel like it is kind of insulting
[00:03:24.390] 但我们当时正在回忆那天晚上目睹的一切，然后我朋友突然说：“我的天哪，这个人一直喋喋不休。” 我觉得这有点侮辱人。
[00:03:34.150] But it just made it so much more funny rather than just feeling. Oh this person like talk too much Yeah and then the other way I've seen it in real life was like if someone just has what is called a bad opinion or
[00:03:34.150] 但这反而让事情变得更有趣，而不仅仅是感觉。哦，这个人话太多了。是啊，还有一种情况我在现实生活中也见过，就是如果有人持有所谓的“错误观点”，或者
[00:03:45.870] Just an opinion that someone else disagrees with then someone will Usually be like, oh stop yapping or like you're a professional yapper. You know, your opinion is invalid basically
[00:03:45.870] 如果你的观点与他人不同，通常会有人说：“别唠叨了”或者“你真是个唠叨鬼”。你知道，你的观点基本上是无效的。
[00:03:56.070] Yeah, I've definitely seen that as well. And I think another funny thing I've seen on tik-tok is I guess I'm on like girlfriend talk I think But basically there's like couples or or like girlfriends or whatever and they're like, yeah, I'm always like yapping away
[00:03:56.070] 对，我也肯定见过。我觉得在TikTok上看到的另一个有趣的东西，我猜我关注的是一个叫“闺蜜聊天”的频道，里面都是一些情侣或者闺蜜之类的，她们会说：“是啊，我总是喋喋不休。”
[00:04:12.430] I'm like boyfriend like making no sense and I feel like that's really funny too. And it's just like making fun of yourself Oh, it's true
[00:04:12.430] 我男朋友说话总是莫名其妙，我觉得这样也挺搞笑的。这就像是在自嘲一样。哦，确实如此。
[00:04:20.350] Actually, I can kind of relate to that because I think I'm going through something right now where sometimes I feel like I'm saying things Out loud to James, but I'm not actually saying them like I'm just thinking them
[00:04:20.350] 其实我有点感同身受，因为我现在也正经历着类似的情况，有时候我觉得自己好像在对詹姆斯大声说话，但实际上我并没有说出口，只是在心里想着而已。
[00:04:30.590] So then I was like in this conversation, I guess quote-unquote with James, right? Yeah Oh, and I like went from point A to point C basically and then James wasn't answering So I was like are you gonna answer and then James was like wait
[00:04:30.590] 所以，当时我就在跟詹姆斯的对话里，对吧？嗯，基本上就是从A点说到C点，然后詹姆斯就没回答。我就问他，你到底要不要回答？然后詹姆斯就说，等等。
[00:04:44.230] Can I get like some context on what you just said cuz you just dropped some random sentence out of nowhere I was like, oh no, I Was yapping in my head and also externally So
[00:04:44.230] 你能解释一下你刚才说的话吗？因为你突然冒出一句莫名其妙的话，我当时就想，糟了，我当时脑子里一直在想，而且也跟别人说了。
[00:04:57.350] It was like you said point A and then point B was happening in your head and you said point C Yeah, I think it's cuz I was cleaning So I'm like doing stuff and I was like distracted and then I was like wait, is he gonna respond?
[00:04:57.350] 就像你说了A点，然后脑子里又浮现出B点，接着你说了C点。是啊，我觉得是因为我在打扫卫生，所以我就一边做事一边分心，然后我就想，等等，他会回复吗？
[00:05:09.950] I realized I just gave him no context He's just like wait what you said something. Oh my god. That's so funny. You know what? I'm a yapper when I'm drunk as well And I think I'm also a yapper at night sometimes oh, yeah, I feel uh
[00:05:09.950] 我意识到我刚才完全没给他任何背景信息。他就像在说“等等，你说什么？”。我的天哪。这太搞笑了。你知道吗？我喝醉的时候也爱唠叨。而且我觉得我晚上有时候也爱唠叨。哦，是的，我感觉……
[00:05:27.110] I'm the kind of girlfriend to bother the shit out of my partner right as they're comfortable and about to fall asleep and like dude like blah blah blah blah and they're like I Guess I'll have to stay away for this conversation
[00:05:27.110] 我就是那种会在伴侣舒服地准备睡觉的时候，故意打扰他/她，然后喋喋不休地说个不停，最后他/她只能无奈地躲开，心想“看来我得躲开你们的谈话了”。
[00:05:41.670] Oh my god, I totally feel that I'm the type of yapper where if I'm like really into something or like I'm going through something Transformative in my life, so I'll talk about this later. But right now I'm in jury duty I'll just like non-stop yap about it
[00:05:41.670] 我的天哪，我感觉自己就是那种话痨，如果我真的对某件事特别感兴趣，或者我的人生经历了一些重大转变，我就会慢慢说，以后再说。但现在我在履行陪审义务，我就要不停地唠叨这件事了。
[00:05:55.710] Like people will try to pivot the conversation away to something more like interesting and I'm like we have to go back to me being in jury duty My god, we must discuss this wait I think this is valid though because I think out of all my close friends
[00:05:55.710] 就像人们会试图把话题转移到更有趣的事情上，而我却觉得我们又得回到我被传唤当陪审员这件事上。我的天，我们必须讨论这件事。等等，我觉得这事儿挺合理的，因为我觉得在我所有的好朋友中……
[00:06:11.070] You're the only one who I know who is legitimately in jury duty Like everyone usually either doesn't get picked or they have some excuse and they end up not going So, I mean, I'm like keep yapping
[00:06:11.070] 你是我认识的唯一一个真正履行陪审义务的人。其他人要么没被选中，要么找各种借口最后都没去。所以，我的意思是，你就继续说吧。
[00:06:24.410] Wait, I feel so validated. I've been like literally making people's ears bleed by talking about I'm like, oh my god. What is jury duty? Also because I'm Canadian. So whenever I get jury duty notice or summons, I'm just like oh, I'm not a citizen
[00:06:24.410] 等等，我感觉自己被认可了。我之前一直在跟人唠叨，都快把人耳朵都听聋了，我就想，我的天啊，陪审义务到底是什么？还有，因为我是加拿大人。所以每次收到陪审义务通知或传票，我都会想，哦，我不是公民。
[00:06:42.010] They're like, all right, like fuck off Dude, honestly, that's the best excuse and actually I think you're right like I personally don't know a ton of people who have actually served in a jury before and
[00:06:42.010] 他们会说，好吧，滚蛋吧，老兄，说真的，这是最好的借口了，而且我觉得你说得对，我个人认识的人里，真正当过陪审员的也没几个。
[00:06:54.490] I was kind of wondering if maybe the county that I live in just has less people compared to where I grew up Where a lot of our like family friends live and whatnot
[00:06:54.490] 我有点纳闷，我住的这个县是不是比我长大的地方人口少，我很多家人朋友都住在我长大的地方。
[00:07:03.370] So that could be a potential reason and I think another reason is also because we're like kind of recently Working adults and like not students. Yeah, especially because a couple of those years were COVID So I'm not actually sure if they were doing jury duty at the time
[00:07:03.370] 所以这可能是一个潜在原因，我觉得另一个原因是，我们最近都算是工作人士了，而不是学生。是的，尤其是有几年正好赶上新冠疫情，所以我不太确定他们当时是否在履行陪审义务。
[00:07:17.470] But this is just such a crazy experience for me that I think it's like overtaking The way that I view life like oh my god I know that's so dramatic, but I was like texting a group chat the other day
[00:07:17.470] 但这对我来说真是一次太疯狂的经历，我觉得它彻底改变了我看待生活的方式，天哪，我知道这听起来很夸张，但我前几天在群聊里说……
[00:07:28.890] I was on my lunch break at jury duty And I was like complaining about how I had no friends at jury duty basically And instead of saying I'm so lonely like no one's talking to me at jury duty
[00:07:28.890] 我在陪审团义务期间午休，抱怨说我在陪审团里基本上没有朋友。我没有说我好孤独，好像在陪审团里没人跟我说话。
[00:07:41.110] I was like, I don't have any friends at work. So like sucks or something and James was like work No, this is your civil duty this is a work I take it that seriously
[00:07:41.110] 我当时就想，我在工作中一个朋友都没有。感觉糟透了。然后詹姆斯说，工作？不，这是你的公民义务，这是工作，我非常认真对待。
[00:07:55.530] Dude, this is why you are selected because they knew they're like dude. This is legitimate work to her Like she is here to learn and vote and deliver Bro, I'm not gonna lie. Okay, I would be lying if I said that I didn't feel immense joy
[00:07:55.530] 兄弟，这就是你被选中的原因，因为他们知道你就是那种人。对她来说，这是份正经工作。她来这里是为了学习、投票和履行职责。兄弟，我不会撒谎。好吧，如果我说我没有感到无比喜悦，那我就撒谎了。
[00:08:11.490] satisfaction and pride from being selected as a juror I was like This is probably just because I was one of the last names called and they just want to speed up the selection process
[00:08:11.490] 被选为陪审员，我既感到满足又感到自豪。但我当时想，这大概只是因为我是最后几个被叫到名字的，他们只是想加快遴选过程。
[00:08:20.530] But I feel like the chosen one dude. It's like the bachelor you got a rose. Oh my god. Yeah That's so funny cuz normally people are like dude, please don't choose me. Don't you? I think I kind of felt like both emotions
[00:08:20.530] 但我感觉自己就像天选之子一样。就像单身汉节目里你收到了一朵玫瑰。我的天哪。是啊，这太搞笑了，因为通常人们都会说，兄弟，千万别选我。你不觉得吗？我觉得我两种感觉都有。
[00:08:36.130] But I truly did feel special when I was selected as one of the jurors Yeah, and I don't know it has been a very interesting experience so far I think you're right
[00:08:36.130] 但当我被选为陪审员时，我真的感觉很特别。是啊，到目前为止，这真是一段非常有趣的经历。我想你说得对。
[00:08:47.130] Like a lot of people want to get out of jury duty and honestly for the logistics and convenience of my life right now I think that would have been a better choice as well But a lot of people ask me like oh, why don't you say this?
[00:08:47.130] 很多人都想逃避陪审义务，老实说，就我目前的生活安排和便利性而言，我认为逃避陪审义务也是一个更好的选择。但是很多人问我，为什么你不这么说呢？
[00:08:57.650] I heard it helps you get out of jury duty or like oh usually if you talk about this or something, you know They won't want to select you and whatnot. But yeah, I think for me the inconvenience thing was
[00:08:57.650] 我听说这能帮你免除陪审义务，或者说，通常如果你谈论这个话题，他们就不会选你之类的。不过，我觉得对我来说，不便之处主要在于……
[00:09:09.210] Not big enough of a factor for me to like want to do those things to get out of it And plus I was just like curious about it Anyway, it's like I watched the show jury duty on Amazon Prime Video and I was like that could be me
[00:09:09.210] 这对我来说不足以成为我为了逃避陪审义务而去做那些事的理由。而且我只是有点好奇而已。总之，我看了亚马逊Prime Video上的真人秀节目《陪审义务》，然后我就想，这说的可能就是我。
[00:09:21.210] or Were you running away from your other responsibilities? Damn Sorry that got too real Okay, but I wasn't like, you know pitching myself to be a juror That's true Cuz I think I remember someone had given a tip like oh
[00:09:21.210] 或者你是在逃避其他责任？该死，抱歉，我好像说得太认真了。好吧，但我并没有主动争取当陪审员。没错，因为我记得有人给我提过建议，比如……
[00:09:38.170] Maybe if you say something along these lines like you won't chosen and you're like, I'm not gonna lie though Yeah, I mean that to me is kind of like I guess you're not sworn in when you're answering these questions To be like a potential juror or whatever
[00:09:38.170] 也许你可以说类似这样的话，比如你不会被选中，然后你会说，说实话，嗯，我的意思是，这对我来说有点像，你回答这些问题的时候并没有宣誓就职，就像一个潜在的陪审员之类的。
[00:09:51.570] But it's like, you know the thing about like perjury and like oh don't cry in court Like the judge is called like the honorable whatever whatever and I'm just like, okay first of all, that's just like scary to break the rules like
[00:09:51.570] 但你知道，就像作伪证那一套，还有“别在法庭上哭”之类的，法官会被称作“尊敬的某某某”，我就想，好吧，首先，违反规则真的很可怕。
[00:10:03.570] And then I guess the other thing too is like I heard if you are Clearly very opinionated for example or like very traumatized about stuff Then it wouldn't make you like a good fit to be a juror for a lot of cases
[00:10:03.570] 还有一点，我听说，如果你非常固执己见，或者对某些事情有很深的心理创伤，那么在很多案件中，你可能都不适合担任陪审员。
[00:10:16.090] So then that's why they would excuse you But I guess I don't feel like I'm super opinionated about like a lot of things like maybe when I was younger But now I feel like I'm just like a very average person
[00:10:16.090] 所以这就是他们会原谅你的原因。不过我觉得我现在对很多事情不像年轻时那样特别有主见了，现在我觉得自己就像个很普通的人。
[00:10:28.810] Yeah, like very very average. So then I feel like it's also Maybe one of the reasons why I was selected But yeah That's true because I think sometimes we were like dude just say this like random egregious opinion and you know They'll tell you to leave
[00:10:28.810] 是啊，非常非常普通。所以我觉得这可能也是我被选中的原因之一。没错，确实如此，因为我觉得有时候我们会说一些莫名其妙的、很离谱的观点，然后他们就会让你走。
[00:10:41.450] Okay, the thing too is this isn't like a one-on-one interview with the judge or like the attorney when they do the selection process There's an audience of 80 to 100 people in front of you. So yeah, so it's like people are like
[00:10:41.450] 好吧，还有一点，这不像是和法官或律师一对一的面试，也不是他们进行遴选过程时的那种面试。你面前有80到100名观众。所以，是的，就像人们会说……
[00:10:54.690] Oh, you know act like you're crazy or do this It's like can you do that comfortably in front of a hundred people? Like that's tough for even you know Someone who is that opinionated? Yeah. Whoa. Okay. I had no idea
[00:10:54.690] 哦，你知道，装疯卖傻或者做这个……就好像你能在一百个人面前自在地这么做吗？就算对像你这样固执己见的人来说，这也很难吧？是啊。哇。好吧。我完全不知道。
[00:11:07.050] I thought it was just like they put you in a room and I for some reason I always imagine it like those rooms and movies and TV shows where like a detective questions you
[00:11:07.050] 我以为就像他们把你关进一个房间，不知为何我总是想象成电影、电视剧里那种房间，侦探在那里审问你。
[00:11:18.450] They like interrogate you exactly and then they're like, all right, you need to either go home or like get back in line We might pick you. I think the setup too is the interview maybe 15 or 20 people at a time
[00:11:18.450] 他们会像审问犯人一样盘问你，然后说，好了，你要么回家，要么重新排队，我们可能会选你。我觉得面试的形式可能是同时面试15到20人。
[00:11:31.730] People interviewing you are like the judge the attorneys on both sides, etc There's like a super scary bailiff staring at you and then in the other seats There's kind of like an audience, but they're really more like other prospective jurors
[00:11:31.730] 面试你的人就像法官、双方律师等等。有个看起来很吓人的法警盯着你，其他座位上的人有点像观众，但他们其实更像是其他候选陪审员。
[00:11:45.530] So they're just waiting to be a part of the like 15 to 20 that get called to get questioned Right, it kind of feels like you're on like a show or something
[00:11:45.530] 所以他们就等着成为被叫去接受讯问的15到20人中的一员。对，感觉就像在参加什么真人秀节目一样。
[00:11:52.410] Maybe because I recently watched jury duty and I feel like because it's such a serious and like high-pressure environment I feel like the opinionated people around me We're trying to like throttle or you know
[00:11:52.410] 也许是因为我最近看了《陪审团义务》，感觉因为那是个非常严肃、压力很大的环境，我周围那些爱发表意见的人，就像在试图控制局面一样，你知道的。
[00:12:03.490] Be defensive about their opinions and try to minimize them a little bit because it kind of feels like you're on the stand You're being put to trial a little bit. Oh, I could totally see that all these people are judging you
[00:12:03.490] 对他们的意见要有所保留，尽量淡化它们的影响，因为这感觉就像你在法庭上，好像被审判了一样。哦，我完全能看出这些人都在评判你。
[00:12:16.530] Exactly, and you're like fuck. I can't say the wrong thing. Yeah, I guess they see who crumbles under pressure Mmm, so maybe if you just burst out in tears, they'll be like, all right, like send her out Yeah, but it's actually been a very interesting experience
[00:12:16.530] 没错，然后你就会想：完了。我可不能说错话。是啊，我猜他们是想看看谁会在压力下崩溃。嗯，所以也许如果你突然哭出来，他们就会说，好吧，把她赶出去。是啊，但这确实是一次非常有趣的经历。
[00:12:33.730] Honestly, I think one of the hardest things for me is I haven't been exposed to the courtroom environment very much So it's all very new which means the memories are like the rules or like things that I know about it are very limited
[00:12:33.730] 说实话，我觉得最难的一点是，我对法庭环境了解甚少。一切都很陌生，这意味着我对法庭的记忆，比如规则或者其他相关知识，都非常有限。
[00:12:46.490] So the one thing I'm constantly thinking about when I'm in jury duty is Judge Judy You know with like the angry judge and she's always on everyone Yeah, I'm always like damn
[00:12:46.490] 所以，我每次当陪审员的时候，脑子里总是想着朱迪法官。你知道，就是那个脾气暴躁的法官，她总是对每个人都很苛刻。是啊，我总是想，真是的。
[00:12:59.210] And then the other thing I think about is I don't know if you've ever watched the Amanda show. Yes, Amanda Bynes, right? Yes. Yes, do you know the segment? So she used to do a bunch of skits, but she had one
[00:12:59.210] 还有一件事我想说的是，我不知道你有没有看过阿曼达·拜恩斯的节目。对，就是那个阿曼达·拜恩斯的节目，对吧？对。对，你知道她主持的那个节目吗？她以前经常做小品，其中一个特别出演。
[00:13:11.330] Particularly that was in a courtroom and she would play the judge Basically, they would have like a fake scenario or something for the courtroom and she would always ask the two attorneys to approach the bench
[00:13:11.330] 尤其是在法庭上，她会扮演法官。基本上，他们会模拟一个法庭场景，她总是会要求两位律师走到法官席前。
[00:13:22.130] I think is what it's called and then she would just slam their hands into the drawer or some shit I don't know if you remember that But that was like one of the iconic things from that skit bad the dancing lobsters
[00:13:22.130] 我想那招应该叫这个，然后她就会把他们的手猛地砸到抽屉上之类的，我不知道你还记不记得。但那是那个小品《跳舞的龙虾》里最经典的桥段之一。
[00:13:32.450] So I'm just sitting here in like a very serious trial and I'm like thinking about these two things and I'm like I need to stop Thinking about it Yeah, oh wait, that's so funny. Okay, would you say jury duty? The show is pretty accurate
[00:13:32.450] 所以我现在就坐在这里，参加一个非常严肃的庭审，脑子里却想着这两件事，然后我就想，我得停止想它们。哦，等等，这太搞笑了。好吧，你会说是陪审义务吗？这节目说得挺准的。
[00:13:46.810] I think I would have to rewatch it just because when I first watched the show I had no Basis of what it actually should be. So maybe once this whole process is over I'll go and rewatch it again, but it's definitely pretty similar. I would say so far
[00:13:46.810] 我觉得我得重看一遍，因为我第一次看的时候完全不知道这部剧到底应该是什么样子。所以也许等这一切结束后我会再去重看一遍，不过就目前来看，它确实很相似。
[00:14:02.090] Okay, good to know after you told me I was like, I should probably watch jury duty. This sounds interesting Maybe I'll get educated Yeah, but honestly my life this year so far after we got back from our travel plans
[00:14:02.090] 好的，你告诉我之后我就想，我应该看看《陪审团义务》这部剧。听起来很有意思，也许我能从中学习到点什么。是啊，不过说实话，自从我们结束旅行回来之后，我今年的生活就有点……
[00:14:15.530] Has been jury duty as you can clearly tell because I will not stop yapping about it Anyways enough about me. What have you been up to lately crystal? Honestly, I've been up to I guess quarter life crisis in the end and beginning of each year
[00:14:15.530] 很明显，我一直在履行陪审义务，因为我一直在喋喋不休地谈论这件事。好了，我的事就说到这儿吧。克里斯托，你最近在忙些什么呢？说实话，我感觉自己每年年初和年末都会经历四分之一人生危机。
[00:14:34.810] It's usually kind of like quiet Less busy in terms of work and also social life sometimes because I feel like people tend to be traveling During this time. I just felt very I don't know unmotivated low energy lethargic and I was like damn
[00:14:34.810] 这段时间通常比较安静，工作和社交生活都比较清闲，因为感觉大家都在旅行。我当时感觉很没劲，提不起精神，昏昏沉沉的，心想：哎。
[00:14:51.730] What's wrong with me? Is this seasonal depression? Sometimes I'm just like wow, I'm just gonna like lie in bed all day and I guess we kind of talked about this last year a little bit too
[00:14:51.730] 我这是怎么了？这是季节性抑郁症吗？有时候我就会想，哇，我只想整天躺在床上。我想我们去年也稍微聊过这个话题。
[00:15:03.730] But I guess the idea is like a lot of things that we do is stuff that we've been doing you know, there's like not as much new stuff around and So it's really easy to just kind of do nothing and let the days blend together
[00:15:03.730] 但我觉得，我们做的很多事情其实都是老一套，你知道，周围没什么新鲜事，所以很容易就什么都不做，任由日子混成一团。
[00:15:19.770] You like lose sight of everything you're like, oh god, what day is it? What week is it? But then like deep inside you're like I want to do something You know, like I want to get up and and get inspired and like do whatever is fun and whatnot
[00:15:19.770] 你会感觉自己完全忘了时间，你会想，天哪，今天是星期几？是第几周？但内心深处你又会想，我想做点什么，你知道，我想振作起来，找到灵感，去做任何有趣的事情。
[00:15:36.090] Wow, sorry. This is like so depressing I think actually I'm sure a lot of people I mean definitely including myself can relate to that though And I wonder if it's also just the contrast like the weather
[00:15:36.090] 哇，真抱歉。这感觉好令人沮丧，我想很多人，包括我自己，肯定都能感同身受。我在想，是不是也跟天气之类的反差有关？
[00:15:47.810] I know is a big factor for anyone who's not in the Bay Area the weather here has been very very gloomy and like rainy I think more so than prior year January's maybe
[00:15:47.810] 我知道这对不在湾区的人来说是个很大的影响因素，这里的天气一直非常阴沉，而且总是下雨，我觉得比往年一月份还要糟糕。
[00:15:57.330] But I feel like since the holidays and especially like the last quarter of every year is always so crazy and vibrant and busy It's like the first quarter of the next year always feels so dull. Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting
[00:15:57.330] 但我觉得，自从假期过后，尤其是每年的最后一个季度，总是那么疯狂、热闹、忙碌，相比之下，来年的第一个季度就总是显得那么沉闷。是啊，我也不知道。挺有意思的。
[00:16:10.970] I I was like wow, am I having a quarter-life crisis? Like I don't know what to do I feel like it's sometimes hard to have the Activation energy get up and do something and I think maybe it's also a suburb thing sort of in
[00:16:10.970] 我当时就想，哇，我这是在经历四分之一人生危机吗？感觉自己不知道该做什么，有时候很难提起劲儿去做点什么，我觉得这可能也跟住在郊区有关。
[00:16:26.650] Order for us to go do stuff We kind of have to like get up go to our car and drive like 20 plus minutes to wherever Like even target which isn't even that far is like 20 minutes from me
[00:16:26.650] 我们需要下班才能去办事。我们得起床，走到车里，开车二十分钟以上才能到任何地方。就连离我家不算远的塔吉特超市也要二十分钟。
[00:16:38.410] And then you have to worry about like, oh I have to drive another 20 minutes back home It starts being like oh if there's something that I want to do Is it worth the commute kind of and then there's a lot of cost-benefit analysis
[00:16:38.410] 然后你还得担心，比如，哦，我还要开车20分钟回家。你会开始想，哦，如果我想做点什么，值得花这趟通勤时间吗？然后就会有很多成本效益分析。
[00:16:53.170] Almost in the suburbs, especially in the Bay because it's so big right, right You're like is it worth it to like go up to whatever city or like go to?
[00:16:53.170] 几乎都在郊区，尤其是在湾区，因为湾区太大了，对吧，对吧？你会想，去某个城市或者其他地方值得吗？
[00:17:01.970] Whatever restaurant drive back and spend an hour or two driving to have like a 30-minute meal or something like that or like have do I like One hour activity that kind of stuff has been on my mind a lot where I'm like, oh, you know
[00:17:01.970] 不管去哪家餐厅，开车回去花一两个小时就为了吃个半小时的饭，或者干脆去做个一小时的活动之类的，这些事情我一直在想，你知道吗？
[00:17:16.370] Why is it sometimes hard to do things or why is it easier to do nothing? Oh Dude, actually the way that you kind of framed and describe that makes me wonder So I also live in the suburbs now, but for a very short period of my life
[00:17:16.370] 为什么有时候做事很难，而什么都不做却更容易？哦，老兄，你这样描述这个问题，让我不禁思考。我现在也住在郊区，不过只是人生中很短暂的一段时间。
[00:17:32.170] I lived up in San Francisco for a little bit and during those times I lived in apartment buildings, right? And I feel like the interesting thing about our apartment buildings was you could always kind of look into just the way that the layout
[00:17:32.170] 我在旧金山住了一段时间，那段时间我住在公寓楼里，对吧？我觉得我们住的公寓楼有趣的地方在于，你可以仔细研究一下它们的布局。
[00:17:46.050] Was you could always kind of look into someone else's apartment and I feel like that's like somewhat Common ish in a lot of big like dense cities
[00:17:46.050] 你总能窥探到别人的公寓，我觉得这在很多人口密集的大城市里都挺常见的。
[00:17:53.690] It's just like you can walk on whatever Street and sort of look into someone's home if they're like lights are on in the evening I just remember any time, you know, we would finish at work. I would take the bus home in the evening and
[00:17:53.690] 就像你可以随便走在任何一条街上，如果晚上有人家亮着灯，你就能窥视到他们家里的情况。我记得以前，我们下班后，我晚上会坐公交车回家，
[00:18:07.090] On the bus, I'm like riding with a lot of these people and then on the walk to the apartment There's like a bunch of people walking around me. I can look into people's apartments See what they're up to people in restaurants, etc, etc
[00:18:07.090] 在公交车上，我跟很多人一起乘车，然后步行去公寓的路上，周围也都是人。我可以窥视别人的公寓，看看他们在做什么，看看餐厅里的人等等。
[00:18:19.090] And I think that was one of the first times where I really felt like oh I wonder if this is why like cities are actually considered communities because in the suburbs I'm not really looking into people's homes. You like rarely see someone outside
[00:18:19.090] 我想那是我第一次真正意识到，或许这就是为什么城市会被视为社区的原因，因为在郊区，我很少会注意到人们的家。你很少会在户外看到有人。
[00:18:34.010] You know to be able to look into a restaurant you really have to be like on a busy street or something I feel like you have to be more intentional about it. Whereas in the city people are just around you and it's like normal
[00:18:34.010] 你知道，要想好好考察一家餐厅，你得找个热闹的街边小店之类的，感觉得更用心才行。而在城市里，人来人往，一切都很自然。
[00:18:45.570] I think it's so funny that looking into other people's homes And like their windows you're like, oh my god is this community? You're so right Okay, but it's so accurate though, isn't it it's like a guilty pleasure that everyone does that's true
[00:18:45.570] 我觉得偷看别人家里的照片特别搞笑，比如透过窗户看，你会想，我的天，这是社区吗？你说得太对了！好吧，这确实很贴切，不是吗？这就像一种人人都有的、难以启齿的乐趣，没错。
[00:19:05.170] I mean like in New York literally the High Line is known you walk down the High Line and look into people's windows Oh my god That's so funny though. You're like, oh my god, this is community. I'm like neighbor. I love you
[00:19:05.170] 我的意思是，就像在纽约，高线公园可是出了名的，你沿着高线公园走走，就能看到别人家的窗户。我的天哪，这太搞笑了。你会想，我的天哪，这就是社区啊。我就像邻居一样，爱你。
[00:19:19.690] And I'm sure they were also looking through your windows. Oh, yeah, and they're like neighbor. I love you back Holy fuck. So I guess until suburban homes also have you know windows that make it easy access for
[00:19:19.690] 而且我敢肯定他们也透过你的窗户往里看。哦，对了，他们就像邻居一样。我也爱你，我的天哪。所以我想，直到郊区住宅也装上那种方便他们进入的窗户为止……
[00:19:37.030] Pedestrians walking around I feel like it's just a little bit isolating like you truly don't see anyone unless you Commit to seeing someone that day. Yeah, you're so right. I think suburbs are definitely very
[00:19:37.030] 我觉得在街上走行人有点孤单，除非你特意约人，否则根本见不到任何人。是啊，你说得太对了。我觉得郊区确实非常……
[00:19:49.710] Private, you know people are living in single homes single family homes, you know, our walls are not attached You don't know about your neighbors unless you specifically go out and like, you know, try to meet them, right? Apartments and stuff Dude, you know what?
[00:19:49.710] 私密性好，你知道，人们住在独栋住宅里，独栋房屋，你知道，我们的墙壁是分开的。除非你特意出去，试着去认识他们，否则你根本不了解你的邻居，对吧？公寓之类的。哥们，你知道吗？
[00:20:05.990] Your neighbors are up to like you hear shit from this like the ceilings and the floors and the walls Like why is my neighbor moving so much furniture today? Like what's going on in their life? Do I remember at one apartment unit?
[00:20:05.990] 你的邻居们好像在搞什么鬼，你都能听到天花板、地板和墙壁里传来各种怪声。比如，为什么我的邻居今天搬了这么多家具？他们到底经历了什么？我记得好像在某个公寓单元里发生过类似的事情？
[00:20:19.710] I felt like I could describe the exact cleaning schedule of my upstairs. This person vacuums at these times of the day. Yeah. Oh My god one of my neighbors one time I was like for some reason they're like rearranging their fucking furniture every other week or something
[00:20:19.710] 我感觉我能把楼上的清洁时间表描述得一清二楚。这个人每天几点吸尘。是啊。我的天哪，有一次我跟一个邻居说，不知道为什么，他们好像每隔一周就要重新摆放一次家具什么的。
[00:20:38.070] Either that or they like deep clean every week It's like there's a lot of more than just footsteps going on up there It's kind of interesting because you know, we're like laughing about it now
[00:20:38.070] 要么就是他们喜欢每周都彻底清洁。感觉上面除了脚步声之外还有很多其他声音。挺有意思的，你知道，我们现在都笑出声来了。
[00:20:49.990] But I feel like these are things that I used to find so annoying about apartment life Like I would be like I can't wait until we move out and live in like a single-family home or something because life would be so
[00:20:49.990] 但我感觉这些都是我以前觉得公寓生活很烦人的事情。比如我会想，我迫不及待地想搬出去，住进独栋房子之类的，因为生活会变得……
[00:21:00.710] Quiet, but it's sort of like be careful what you wish for because it truly becomes very quiet. Yeah, very quiet Yeah, like silent Similar to what you said earlier a lot of suburban streets are very quiet in terms of like the people bustling about
[00:21:00.710] 很安静，但就像“小心你的愿望”一样，因为这里真的会变得非常安静。是啊，非常安静。嗯，就像寂静无声一样。就像你之前说的，很多郊区街道都很安静，很少有人走动。
[00:21:16.750] There's not really people bustling about they're like rustling occasionally occasional rustles Right. Okay, you know what's actually crazy one time I was coming home and it's kind of late. It was like 2 a.m
[00:21:16.750] 这里其实没什么人走动，只有偶尔传来沙沙声。好吧，你知道吗，有一次我回家，时间已经很晚了，大概凌晨两点。
[00:21:31.230] And I just see this old couple jogging in the neighborhood and I was like, whoa, it's fucking 2 a.m Like what are you guys doing? Yeah, and now that I'm thinking about I'm like, whoa Is that they wanted so much peace that they're like fuck it
[00:21:31.230] 我刚才看到一对老夫妇在街区慢跑，我心想，哇，都凌晨两点了，你们在干嘛呢？是啊，现在想想，我又觉得，哇，他们是不是太想要清静了，所以就干脆不跑步了？
[00:21:45.550] We're just gonna run in the middle of the night. Fuck the daytime running. There's too many cars. We need it when it's dead silent Dude I'm not gonna lie. I'm just imagining you having witnessed a robbery or something
[00:21:45.550] 我们打算半夜跑。白天跑什么的，去他妈的。车太多了。我们需要在寂静无声的时候跑。兄弟，我实话实说，我只是在想象你目睹了什么抢劫之类的。
[00:21:58.310] So I'm literally envisioning a criminal chasing some poor lady. Oh, and it was like, oh my god, like they're jogging She's like screaming for her life. Oh Hopefully that wasn't the case because I saw them again the next week
[00:21:58.310] 我当时脑海里浮现出一个罪犯追赶一位可怜女士的画面。哦，天哪，他们好像在慢跑，她拼命尖叫求生。哦，希望情况不是这样，因为我下周又看到他们了。
[00:22:15.510] I was like, wow, this is a thing for them talking. Oh, dude. That's kind of like wild though It really I'm jogging what a guy and they're like, they seemed like maybe 50s Around their 50s. I feel like people in the older generation Like to sleep early
[00:22:15.510] 我当时就想，哇，他们居然会聊这个。哦，老兄。这感觉真有点不可思议。我当时正在慢跑，遇到一个男的，他们看起来大概五十多岁吧。我觉得老一辈的人都喜欢早睡。
[00:22:34.230] Mmm, kind of kind of their thing right early and like get up early, but I was like, okay 2 a.m Either they slept at like 6 p.m. Or they are not like they haven't slept yet
[00:22:34.230] 嗯，他们好像一直都起得很早，但我当时就想，凌晨两点？要么他们下午六点就睡了，要么他们根本就没睡过。
[00:22:47.310] And either way is like crazy, right is this what happens when you live in the suburbs for too long? Oh my god, maybe they were like, let's shake it up. Let's start sleeping at 6 p.m You think it's also interesting contrast actually living like the suburban
[00:22:47.310] 不管怎样，这简直太疯狂了，对吧？这就是在郊区住太久的后果吗？我的天哪，也许他们当时想的是，咱们来点不一样的吧。咱们下午六点就睡觉吧。你觉得这种对比也很有意思，看看现实生活中的郊区生活是怎样的。
[00:23:05.350] American lifestyle and Contrasting it to the Asian lifestyle Especially in like Japan or Korea, which I went to recently things aren't even that popping until like 12 a.m Or something and people are out until like 5 a.m. But here it's like I feel like after 9 p.m
[00:23:05.350] 美国的生活方式，尤其是和亚洲的生活方式相比，比如我最近去过的日本和韩国，那里直到凌晨12点左右才开始热闹起来，人们一直玩到早上5点。但在这里，我觉得晚上9点以后就……
[00:23:22.350] I like rarely see movement out on the streets on my house. Oh my god Yeah, but I guess I feel like my experiences have been like within cities So then usually because it's so dense in Asia
[00:23:22.350] 我很少看到我家附近街上有人走动。天哪，是啊，不过我觉得我的经历大多都发生在城市里，因为亚洲人口密度太高了。
[00:23:34.310] It's all like apartment buildings and pretty crowded so I I don't have any experience with like suburbs in Asia, have you ever seen? Suburban Asia, I guess when I visit my grandma. It's not necessarily like the Bustling part of Busan. It's kind of like a residential neighborhood
[00:23:34.310] 那里全是公寓楼，而且很拥挤，所以我对亚洲的郊区没什么了解，你见过吗？我去奶奶家的时候大概见过亚洲的郊区吧。它跟釜山繁华的城区不太一样，更像是一个居民区。
[00:23:54.430] There it definitely is like significantly more quiet than being on the streets of like Hongdae or like Tokyo or something I think there's still a little bit more movement there
[00:23:54.430] 那里肯定比弘大或者东京之类的街头安静得多，不过我觉得那里还是有一些人来人往的。
[00:24:02.810] Like I wouldn't be super afraid to like walk out to the convenience store by myself at like 10 p.m But here I would probably never do that. Oh my god, that's so true. It's like past 10. It's kind of like oh like
[00:24:02.810] 比如，我晚上十点左右不会特别害怕一个人去便利店，但在这里我可能永远都不会这么做。我的天，说得太对了。都十点多了，感觉就像……
[00:24:15.050] Should we even step foot outside? Yeah, dude when Amazon packages get delivered by 10. I'm like, oh my god Should I even open the door? Should I just get it tomorrow? True like it's on your literal doorstep. It's like
[00:24:15.050] 我们到底要不要出门？是啊，老兄，亚马逊的包裹十点就送到了。我当时就想，我的天啊，我到底要不要开门？要不明天再收？真的，包裹都送到家门口了。就像……
[00:24:30.250] Well, I definitely still feel you on the sluggishness of this time of the year But I do feel like there is always a little bit of an interesting Almost like a collective mindset that I see sometimes. So
[00:24:30.250] 嗯，我当然也能感受到每年这个时候的慵懒氛围。但我感觉，有时候总能感受到一种有趣的、近乎集体性的心态。
[00:24:43.810] Yesterday you and a bunch of our friends were over at our house for a goodbye party for a friend who's moving and I Kind of felt like we had one of the most like wholesome and kind of like sweet nights that we've had in a while
[00:24:43.810] 昨天你和我们一群朋友来我家参加一个朋友搬家的欢送会，我觉得我们度过了一个非常温馨甜蜜的夜晚，这是我们最近一段时间以来最美好的夜晚之一。
[00:24:59.090] Like I wouldn't say it was like fully wholesome, but I felt like it was kind of a family vibe Oh my god, you know what? I mean? Yes. I totally get what you mean After I got home, I was like wow that felt really
[00:24:59.090] 我不会说它完全温馨，但我觉得它有点像家庭氛围。我的天哪，你知道吗？我的意思是？是的。我完全明白你的意思。回家后，我就想，哇，那感觉真好。
[00:25:13.870] Wholesome. Yeah, and like our activities were relatively wholesome We fit some drinking games in there, but like overall, you know, the vibe was still wholesome, right? No one was trying to haze anyone and like no one nothing got out of hand
[00:25:13.870] 挺健康的。是啊，我们的活动也比较健康。我们玩了一些喝酒游戏，但总的来说，气氛还是很健康的，对吧？没人欺负别人，也没发生什么失控的事。
[00:25:28.250] We all just like had a really good time together Yeah, you're right. It did feel kind of family. Like it was just like wow, this is so nice These are some of our like longest standing friends at least on my me and James's side
[00:25:28.250] 我们在一起玩得都很开心。是啊，你说得对。确实感觉像家人一样。就像，哇，这感觉真好。这些都是我和詹姆斯这边认识最久的朋友。
[00:25:43.730] But like you've already been a part of this friend group for a long time as well. So, huh? Yeah, I don't know the vibes are really good yesterday Yeah, and I was actually thinking about it and I think you're totally right in the sense that like
[00:25:43.730] 但你也已经在这个朋友圈里待了很久了。所以，嗯？是啊，我不知道，昨天的气氛真的很好。嗯，我其实也想过这个问题，我觉得你说的完全对，就像……
[00:25:58.250] people just have a little bit less crazy social schedules right now and people maybe Are feeling similar emotions to us where it's like, oh, it's like kind of slow Bordering loneliness and like rest I guess so then when you have these gatherings
[00:25:58.250] 人们现在的社交活动没那么疯狂了，可能大家和我们一样，感觉有点慢，有点孤独，需要休息。所以，当有聚会的时候……
[00:26:14.370] It just feels a lot more special and intimate and people maybe open up a little bit more. It's like interesting, right? It's like not even to say that we just sat there and talked about like deep things on our mind or anything
[00:26:14.370] 感觉更特别、更亲密，人们也更容易敞开心扉。挺有意思的，对吧？感觉就像我们只是坐在那里，聊一些我们心里想的深奥话题什么的。
[00:26:24.330] But it just felt very intimate still and maybe it's just like our mindset together was somewhat like that. Mm-hmm oh my god, so true at one point because one of our friends brought a Karaoke machine and so we were like, oh my god
[00:26:24.330] 但感觉还是很亲密，也许我们当时的心境就是这样吧。嗯哼，我的天哪，确实有那么一刻，我们一个朋友带了台卡拉OK机，我们当时就想，我的天哪
[00:26:38.030] Yeah, let's karaoke but then like we couldn't find the right charger for the longest time for like the speaker Now one of our friends was like, alright guys, it's time to sit down and talk about our feelings
[00:26:38.030] 是啊，我们去唱卡拉OK，结果我们找了好久都没找到合适的充电器给音箱充电。这时我们一个朋友说，好了伙计们，是时候坐下来谈谈我们的感受了。
[00:26:49.450] And then someone was like, you know, I'm gonna go pick up some cups. I'll be right back We're like, oh god, let's play Rage Cage But I mean honestly like we as this friend group
[00:26:49.450] 然后有人说，你知道，我去拿几个杯子，马上回来。我们当时就想，哦天哪，咱们玩《Rage Cage》吧！但说真的，我们这群朋友……
[00:27:00.450] We've done that a lot of times like, you know, just sat down and talked about feelings But I guess it was we wanted to keep the vibes light-hearted and positive and it just continued throughout the whole night. This is a successful
[00:27:00.450] 我们以前也经常这样做，比如坐下来聊聊感受。但我想，我们当时是想保持轻松愉快的氛围，而这种氛围也一直持续到晚上。这是一次成功的聚会。
[00:27:12.930] Evening. I've actually been thinking about this kind of stuff a lot so I feel like one of the reoccurring thoughts that I keep having this year is About acting our age
[00:27:12.930] 晚上好。我其实一直在思考这类事情，感觉今年反复出现的一个想法就是“如何表现得像个成年人”。
[00:27:25.370] I know it's like such a weird phrase and I feel like oftentimes it is like a very negative and kind of like Judgmental or like, you know labeling statement of like, oh you better act your age or whatnot
[00:27:25.370] 我知道这句话很奇怪，而且我觉得它很多时候都带有一种很负面、评判性或者贴标签的意味，比如“你最好表现得像个成年人”之类的。
[00:27:36.850] but I guess I've just been feeling like I can sort of see the maturity in us and like, you know the people we love around us and It's one of the years where I feel like I've seen it so much more clearly
[00:27:36.850] 但我感觉我好像看到了我们彼此之间的成熟，也看到了我们身边那些我们爱的人，你知道，今年我感觉自己对这一切看得格外清晰。
[00:27:51.610] Like I see it a lot when people bring up things that are maybe sensitive topics or I see it when people are Sharing stories about tough things that they're going through and talking about how they handled it I'm like wow
[00:27:51.610] 我经常看到有人提起一些可能比较敏感的话题，或者分享他们正在经历的艰难困境以及他们是如何应对的，我都会觉得，哇！
[00:28:04.010] I've known you for X number of years and You or me two three years ago even would not have acted this mature or we would not have Reacted this way or we would not have had the capacity to like process these things as well as we are now
[00:28:04.010] 我认识你已经X年了，两三年前的你我，都不会像现在这样成熟，也不会有这样的反应，更不会像现在这样有能力处理这些事情。
[00:28:18.490] Yeah and it's kind of like a privilege I think to be able to see that transitional process in a lot of people because it's not Something to take for granted to like know people for a long period of time
[00:28:18.490] 是的，我觉得能够见证很多人经历这种转变过程是一种荣幸，因为能够长时间地了解一个人并不是理所当然的事情。
[00:28:29.530] But I just feel like it's so cool to see people blossom this way and it's like we're not even 30 yet So see this so early or like even at this age, I feel like is really interesting Yeah, that makes total sense and I think that people
[00:28:29.530] 但我觉得看到人们这样绽放光彩真的很棒，而且我们甚至还没到30岁呢。这么早就看到这样的成就，或者说在这个年纪就能看到，我觉得真的很有意思。是啊，这完全说得通，而且我觉得人们
[00:28:45.570] Will more often than not surprise you with their maturity in general? And I think you're right Especially with longtime friends because you kind of have an image of them especially when it's like
[00:28:45.570] 他们的成熟度通常会让你感到惊讶，对吧？我觉得你说得对，尤其是对于多年的朋友，因为你对他们会有某种印象，特别是当……
[00:28:58.690] You know all the way back from like elementary school or whatever and then you're like, oh my god Like I totally forgot that you and I have grown up actually like we're so much more mature now Like we have some semblance of what we're doing. Definitely
[00:28:58.690] 你知道，从小学什么的开始，然后你会突然意识到，天哪，我完全忘了你我都长大了，我们现在成熟多了，也更清楚自己在做什么了。确实如此。
[00:29:13.510] Maybe one of the times that I've really felt this last year mid-december right before me and James were traveling We did like a hotpot night with everyone and I feel like
[00:29:13.510] 也许去年12月中旬，就在我和詹姆斯旅行之前，我真正感受到这种感觉的一次，是和大家一起吃了一顿火锅，我觉得
[00:29:24.510] Usually these kinds of nights go like a very specific way. There's like a certain pattern to these nights, right? But this night we like had hot pot
[00:29:24.510] 通常这种夜晚都会按照某种固定的模式进行，对吧？但那天晚上我们想吃火锅。
[00:29:34.310] We sang karaoke for a little bit and then we kind of like split up so like some people were still karaokeing some people were Continuing to eat hot pot or like going back to like revisit it later and things like that
[00:29:34.310] 我们唱了一会儿卡拉OK，然后就各自散开了，有些人还在唱，有些人继续吃火锅，或者打算过段时间再回来继续唱等等。
[00:29:44.910] And I just had this really weird feeling that I could now see us doing This exact same thing like this exact style of night when we were 40 or 50 But the kind of nights that we were having say like two years ago
[00:29:44.910] 我当时突然有一种很奇怪的感觉，觉得我们四五十岁的时候，还会做同样的事情，过着同样风格的夜晚，就像两年前那样。
[00:29:58.910] I feel like there was like an expiration date to these kinds of things Not to say they're like super crazy But you know what? I mean, right just like very late nights and like things that like people in their 20s like to do but this I felt like
[00:29:58.910] 我觉得这类事情好像都有个截止日期。倒不是说它们有多疯狂，但你知道吗？我的意思是，就像熬夜之类的，还有那些二十多岁的人喜欢做的事情，但我感觉……
[00:30:10.670] Was very much like I have seen my parents do this with their friends when I was like in high school This is something very special, you know Yeah I was just about to say the meme is that you know
[00:30:10.670] 感觉就像我高中时看到我父母和朋友们一起做的那样。这很特别，你知道吗？对，我正要说这个梗就是……你知道的
[00:30:21.310] The Asian family friend parties is the parents karaoke and the kids are like On their laptop somewhere playing Maple Story or something. I'm like, oh shit. That's like what we're doing now We've literally had dinner and like sang karaoke. I know
[00:30:21.310] 亚洲朋友家的聚会，父母在唱卡拉OK，孩子们则在各自的笔记本电脑上玩冒险岛之类的游戏。我心想，糟了。我们现在也差不多是这样，吃完晚饭就唱了卡拉OK。我知道。
[00:30:38.950] Although last night we fit in some drinking games You know, we did a little bit of Rage Cage wait the funniest thing was when we were scheduling everything the day before and you're like Chris are you down to play Rage Cage? And I was like
[00:30:38.950] 虽然昨晚我们玩了一些喝酒游戏，你知道，我们玩了一会儿《Rage Cage》。等等，最搞笑的是，前一天我们安排活动的时候，你问我：“克里斯，你想玩《Rage Cage》吗？” 我当时就想：
[00:30:53.670] Yeah, sure, but like not too much rage right like calm cage Do I laugh so hard? It actually was indeed like kind of calm like it was chaotic but in a calm way. Yeah It's hard to describe it was just like really well contained, you know, yeah
[00:30:53.670] 是啊，当然，但感觉没那么愤怒，就像平静的牢笼。我笑得这么厉害？其实确实挺平静的，虽然混乱，但很平静。是啊，很难形容，感觉一切都控制得很好，你知道吗？
[00:31:13.830] People were cheering each other on I think everyone was like excited to play and everyone was down as well Because it was also not scary because it was like, okay We're gonna pour like as little as we can in each of these cups everyone lost gracefully as well
[00:31:13.830] 我觉得大家都在互相加油，每个人都很兴奋，也很紧张。因为比赛并不可怕，大家的想法是，好吧，我们尽量少往每个杯子里倒酒，结果每个人都输得很有风度。
[00:31:30.470] I keep saying this but it was just really good vibes. I Think that's true though. Like we've definitely played Rage Cage a lot even with like this specific group of friends Well, I feel like it's a commonly occurring game
[00:31:30.470] 我一直都这么说，但感觉真的特别好。我觉得确实如此。我们确实玩过很多次《狂怒牢笼》，即使是和这群朋友一起玩的。感觉这游戏挺常见的。
[00:31:43.790] But yesterday it kind of felt like it was fun because of the people we were playing with and not because the game is Itself was like fun. Like sometimes you play it because you're like, oh I'd like to play Rage Cage
[00:31:43.790] 但昨天感觉好玩的原因更多在于一起玩的人，而不是游戏本身。有时候你玩游戏只是因为你想玩《狂怒牢笼》。
[00:31:54.270] But yesterday I feel like it was funny because it was like us that was playing it Yeah, but yeah, I think even just reflecting on the last handful of years
[00:31:54.270] 但昨天我觉得挺搞笑的，因为感觉就像是我们自己在玩这个游戏。是啊，不过，我觉得即使只是回顾过去几年……
[00:32:03.070] These gatherings just have evolved so much in terms of like the purpose and intent that we bring to these gatherings I guess. Mm-hmm. I feel like there's such a
[00:32:03.070] 这些聚会的形式和目的都发生了很大的变化，我想。嗯。我觉得现在有很多……
[00:32:14.110] Want to like catch up and like see how everyone's doing get a little bit more comfortable and cozy with everyone Versus oh, we should hang out kind of thing Not that this friend group was ever like not close
[00:32:14.110] 想和大家叙叙旧，看看大家最近怎么样，和每个人都更亲近一些，而不是那种“哦，我们应该一起出去玩玩”之类的客套话。当然，这群朋友的关系一直都很好。
[00:32:25.230] But at least for me I feel like there was some sort of evolution in the last few years you know, I think maybe another thing that contributed to this all like you said the
[00:32:25.230] 但至少对我来说，我觉得过去几年里确实发生了一些变化，你知道，我想也许还有另一个因素促成了这一切，就像你说的……
[00:32:35.830] Gathering was kind of to celebrate and say goodbye to one of our friends who's moving out of state Not that we'll never see her again But it's just like oh, you know, like it's gonna be sad that she's not in the Bay anymore and maybe somewhere
[00:32:35.830] 这次聚会算是庆祝一下，也算是跟一位即将搬离本州的朋友道别。倒不是说以后就见不到她了，只是觉得，唉，她以后不在湾区了，也许会去别的地方，想想就觉得有点伤感。
[00:32:51.790] Subconsciously, that's like a reminder of our being adults, you know, like people Move people like come and go but they're still precious friends It was like a celebration of our friendship. And then that's what like kind of contributed to like the mood
[00:32:51.790] 潜意识里，这就像是提醒我们都是成年人了，你知道，人来人往，但他们仍然是我们珍贵的朋友。这就像是对我们友谊的庆祝。而这也正是营造那种氛围的原因。
[00:33:09.830] Yeah, actually that's a really good point I feel like this friend in particular too is Really really good at gathering people and rallying people to hang out
[00:33:09.830] 是啊，你说的很有道理。我觉得这位朋友尤其擅长召集人，组织大家一起出去玩。
[00:33:18.230] And she has definitely kind of been like a cornerstone of the friend group in terms of like getting Bay Area people to actually commit To something so her leaving I think is gonna be a huge transition for us as well Probably yeah, and I think you're right
[00:33:18.230] 她绝对是我们朋友圈的顶梁柱，尤其擅长让湾区的朋友真正投入到某件事中，所以她的离开对我们来说也是一个巨大的转变。没错，你说得对。
[00:33:33.510] It is interesting to think about it that way because I felt like these things felt so Much more emotional for me when I was younger
[00:33:33.510] 这样想很有意思，因为我觉得小时候这些事对我来说更有情感冲击力。
[00:33:42.870] This is gonna be a little bit weird to describe because I'm not trying to say that I don't feel sad about this friend moving But I guess I now feel more happy for her that she's moving versus when I was younger
[00:33:42.870] 这感觉可能有点奇怪，因为我并不是说我不为朋友搬家感到难过，但我现在比小时候更替她感到高兴。
[00:33:56.310] I think I truly felt sad when people moved away You know what? I'm talking about. I think so It was more like oh, I'm gonna be sad that this person's gone
[00:33:56.310] 我觉得当人们搬走的时候，我真的会感到难过。你知道吗？我指的是那种感觉。我觉得更像是，“哦，这个人走了，我会很难过的。”
[00:34:05.470] But now I'm like, oh, I'm so excited for this person to go like it's like more of a outward Viewpoint versus like an inward looking viewpoint. I think that's exactly right because even when
[00:34:05.470] 但现在我想，哦，我真为这个人感到兴奋，因为他的观点更像是向外看，而不是向内看。我觉得这完全正确，因为即使
[00:34:18.990] we like graduated high school and people kind of dispersed into whatever cities that they were initially going to Or I feel even when you had moved to New York for a little bit I feel like the primary emotion that I felt when someone was moving was like
[00:34:18.990] 我们高中毕业后，就各自散去，去了他们最初想去的城市。或者我觉得，即使你搬到纽约住了一段时间，当有人搬家时，我最主要的感受也是……
[00:34:31.150] Oh, this is like a devastating loss to me And I know that sounds so selfish But I think I just maybe was more selfish back in the day and that's probably also when our lives weren't fully like cemented or maybe we just our
[00:34:31.150] 哦，这对我来说简直是毁灭性的打击。我知道这听起来很自私，但我认为我以前可能更自私一些，而且那时候我们的生活可能还没有完全稳定下来，或者我们只是……
[00:34:43.950] Senses of self weren't as strong yet. So then it truly kind of was like oh my life and my identity are Like an average of these ten people that I'm closest to or whatever Yeah
[00:34:43.950] 自我意识还不强。所以那时候感觉就像，哦，我的生活和我的身份，就像是我最亲近的十个人的平均水平，或者诸如此类。
[00:34:55.470] but now it's like, you know, we each kind of have our own like bubbles and pods of like our own lives and we just Have the privilege to like hang out with each other when we can
[00:34:55.470] 但现在感觉就像，你知道，我们每个人都有自己独立的小圈子，各自过着自己的生活，我们只是有幸能在空闲的时候聚在一起。
[00:35:05.990] so then when you know close friends move away, like it's still sad and it still is like sort of a Loss or like maybe a void in your daily routine or whatever
[00:35:05.990] 所以，当你知道好朋友搬走的时候，仍然会感到难过，仍然会觉得是一种失去，或者像是日常生活中出现了一个空缺之类的。
[00:35:16.790] But at the end of the day, it's like I just feel more happy for that person than I am sad. Oh Wow character development. Wait. Yeah, I think also maybe what helps is now that we're a little more
[00:35:16.790] 但说到底，我感觉自己为那个人感到高兴的远多于难过的。哇，角色发展啊。等等。嗯，我觉得或许也因为我们现在更……
[00:35:31.590] Established it's clearer to us like oh, hey if I plan well and like, you know save up some money I can go travel to this place and hang out with them and they can do the same like they'll probably come back for the
[00:35:31.590] 确定下来之后，我们就更清楚了，比如，如果我计划周全，攒点钱，我就可以去这个地方旅行，和他们一起玩，他们也可以这样做，他们很可能会再来。
[00:35:45.590] Holidays to hang out with family anyway, and then like it's like a now that we've experienced these things more It's like oh, I know what to expect now and I know how to navigate these Situations better than when it first was happening, dude
[00:35:45.590] 假期本来就是和家人一起度过的，而且现在我们经历过更多的事情了，感觉就像，哦，我现在知道会发生什么了，也知道该如何应对这些情况了，比第一次遇到的时候好多了，伙计。
[00:36:01.870] Actually, you're so right because now that I think about it I distinctly have a memory of in 2019. One of our friends had moved up to San Francisco and Even that I was like, oh my god, like we're never gonna see her again
[00:36:01.870] 确实，你说得太对了，现在想想，我确实清楚地记得2019年的一件事。我们一个朋友搬去了旧金山，当时我就想，天哪，我们再也见不到她了。
[00:36:15.290] Like we're not gonna be able to hang out with her that much like this really sucks Well, and we were just in like South Bay and Fremont, which I feel like it's not even that far
[00:36:15.290] 感觉我们以后没法经常和她一起玩了，这真的太糟糕了。我们之前在南湾和弗里蒙特附近，感觉其实离得也不远。
[00:36:25.110] Like yeah, it is not but even that I was like, oh my god. This is such a loss. I Think you're right now. It's like I know that even if someone lived right next door
[00:36:25.110] 是啊，确实不是，但即便如此，我还是觉得，我的天哪。这真是个巨大的损失。我觉得你现在说得对。就好像我知道，即使有人就住在隔壁一样。
[00:36:36.030] It's like still sometimes hard to like find the time to hang out with people. So it's not always about distance I feel like it really is about I don't know what it's about, but it's just hard Dude life is hard I'm with you on that
[00:36:36.030] 感觉有时候还是很难抽出时间和朋友聚聚。所以我觉得这不一定是距离的问题，而是……我也不知道到底是什么原因，反正就是很难。兄弟，生活本来就难，我懂你的感受。
[00:36:53.550] So, I guess one last thought for me in terms of like the I guess intrusive thought of like acting Yeah is as much as I do feel like there's a positive aspect to it where I Like thinking about it because I'm like wow
[00:36:53.550] 所以，关于扮演“是”这个角色，我最后想说的是，虽然我觉得它也有积极的一面，比如我喜欢思考它，因为我会觉得，哇！
[00:37:08.950] we are kind of acting like we are in our late 20s the weird aspect of that a little bit is I kind of find myself trying to define what it Means or looks like to act like we're 27 28. Yeah, and I
[00:37:08.950] 我们现在的行为举止有点像二十七八岁的人，有点奇怪的是，我发现自己一直在试图定义“像27、28岁那样行事”到底意味着什么，或者说是什么样子。是的，而且我
[00:37:24.710] Feel like I'm starting to kind of form an opinion about what I feel like 28 is supposed to be like. Oh And I don't know if this is like the start of me Becoming like a grandma shaking my cane on my porch being like these damn kids or whatever
[00:37:24.710] 感觉我开始对28岁应该是什么样子有点自己的看法了。哦，我不知道这算不算我变成那种在门廊上拄着拐杖、抱怨这些该死的孩子们的老奶奶的开始。
[00:37:40.110] but I guess just because I am thinking about the growth of the people around us and Myself and James, of course it just sometimes highlights things that I
[00:37:40.110] 但我想，正因为我一直在思考我们周围的人，以及我自己和詹姆斯的成长，所以有时候自然而然地就会注意到一些事情。
[00:37:51.750] See people doing when I'm like, oh this is kind of like early 20s or like maybe closer to mid 20s behavior Yeah, that makes sense because it's like us as a collective is kind of character developing together
[00:37:51.750] 看到有些人做的事，我就觉得，哦，这有点像二十出头或者接近二十五六岁的人的行为。嗯，这很合理，因为我们作为一个群体，正在共同成长，性格也在不断发展。
[00:38:04.470] Right, but if someone is like maybe falling behind because of you know circumstances or whatever it becomes a little more noticeable I think also Sometimes seeing young people like having so much energy and like doing all these things. I'm like, whoa. Are you guys not tired?
[00:38:04.470] 没错，但如果有人因为某些原因（比如环境或其他什么原因）而落后，那就更容易被注意到了。我觉得有时候看到年轻人精力充沛，做这么多事情，我就会想，哇，你们不累吗？
[00:38:21.430] Dude that's so true actually I guess like one of the easy examples to me I feel like I used to be quite vain not in the sense of oh I thought I was the best-looking person in the world
[00:38:21.430] 老兄，你说得太对了。其实对我来说，最简单的例子就是，我以前挺自恋的，不是那种觉得自己是世界上最帅的人的自恋。
[00:38:32.350] But it's just like appearance and like these kinds of things Were 50% of what I was thinking about all the time like I feel like it mattered to me significantly more back then So then now when I see tendencies like that in people
[00:38:32.350] 但就像外表之类的东西，曾经占据了我50%的思考时间，我觉得那时候它们对我来说比现在重要得多。所以现在，当我看到人们有类似的倾向时，我会很在意。
[00:38:43.590] I'm just like oh shit that totally reminds me of me like a couple years ago I guess it's like our parents when they're always like oh like looks fade You know
[00:38:43.590] 我当时就想，哎呀，这让我想起了几年前的自己。我觉得就像我们父母总是说的，容颜会老去，你知道的。
[00:38:52.750] Don't just go after looks or whatever you know in the dating pool like the younger you are the more you're like no I want like a beautiful friend or whatever Yeah, we're becoming our parents. I know Yeah, I guess I just feel like
[00:38:52.750] 别只看外表什么的，你知道，在约会对象里，你越年轻，就越会想“不，我想要的是漂亮的朋友”之类的。是啊，我们正在变成我们父母那样的人。我知道。是啊，我想我只是觉得……
[00:39:07.070] Because I am thinking about like we're so much more mature now because we do this It's not saying that you know We're like the most mature people ever but it's like there's specific factors and things that I can point to where I'm like
[00:39:07.070] 因为我觉得我们现在成熟多了，因为我们一起做了这件事。这并不是说我们是最成熟的人，而是说有一些具体的因素和事情，我可以指出来，让我觉得……
[00:39:17.390] Oh, I'm more mature now because I used to do whatever whatever or like, you know, things like that I feel like it goes the opposite way as well Certain things stand out to me because it is something that I would kind of consider
[00:39:17.390] 哦，我现在成熟多了，因为我以前总是随心所欲，或者做些类似的事情。我觉得反过来也一样。有些事情会让我印象深刻，因为这是我会认真考虑的事情。
[00:39:29.030] Immature because it's sort of like the opposite of what I would consider it mature or it's like something you used to do that You've like learned from so you're like, oh this action shows that someone hasn't learned from it quite yet
[00:39:29.030] 不成熟，因为它跟我理解的成熟正好相反，或者说，就像你以前做过但已经吸取了教训的事情，所以你会觉得，哦，这种行为表明有人还没有完全从中吸取教训。
[00:39:41.070] Right, and I feel like the reason why it's it feels more new to me too is I feel like when you're younger It's kind of more about personality differences So I would attribute something to someone's personality versus like their maturity like I feel like it's more about
[00:39:41.070] 对，我觉得之所以感觉更新鲜，是因为年轻的时候，性格差异更重要。我会把一些事情归因于一个人的性格，而不是成熟度。我觉得这更多是……
[00:39:57.070] And now it's like especially as you kind of move through life and it's many stages with different people You see like the average growth rate To make this like a whole fucking thesis But it's just like you can kind of tell when it's not about personality anymore
[00:39:57.070] 现在尤其如此，随着你人生经历的推进，会遇到不同的人，经历很多阶段，你会发现平均增长率……这简直可以写成一篇完整的论文了，但你总能感觉到，什么时候就跟性格无关了。
[00:40:16.750] And it kind of is about whether you've matured or not So I know it's a little bit of a weird thing to say but I feel like it's a lot more about personality
[00:40:16.750] 这其实关乎你是否成熟。我知道这么说可能有点奇怪，但我感觉这更多地与性格有关。
[00:40:25.630] So I know it's a little vague but I think just the fact that I'm thinking about concepts like maturity I'm like this makes me feel like I'm a billion years old like truly giving my cane right now
[00:40:25.630] 我知道这有点含糊，但我觉得，仅仅是思考像成熟这样的概念，就让我感觉自己好像活了亿万年，就像现在真的要拄拐杖一样。
[00:40:38.110] Yeah, but you know, that's just a maybe it's a late 20s thing. You just think about these things We were more experienced now and I think like things are finally like some things that you know Maybe your parents said 10 15 years ago and you're like, oh shit
[00:40:38.110] 是啊，不过你知道，这可能只是二十七八岁才会有的想法。你会思考这些事情。我们现在更有经验了，我觉得有些事情终于像你父母十年前、十五年前说过的那样，而你现在却觉得，哦，天哪
[00:40:54.030] I guess they were kind of right. We'd like see more perspective because of living through More stuff now I think that's exactly right and I kind of wonder maybe life is sort of about like the bulking and cutting process
[00:40:54.030] 我想他们说的也有道理。我们现在经历的事情更多了，所以我们想看到更全面的视角。我觉得这完全正确，我甚至在想，也许人生就像增肌和减脂的过程。
[00:41:08.070] Like, you know how bodybuilders are like people who lift a lot They'll like sometimes go through periods of like huge growth and you know Like gaining mass or whatever so they'll like eat a fuck ton work out a lot and then they go through the cutting process
[00:41:08.070] 你知道，健美运动员就像那些举重很多的人一样，他们有时会经历一段快速增肌期，你知道，就是肌肉量大幅增长什么的，所以他们会吃很多东西，进行大量的训练，然后他们就会进入减脂期。
[00:41:21.470] You know, you get more lean you like diet really hard calorie restrict, etc I feel like in some ways there are some times or certain years in my life where I've grown a lot and by growth
[00:41:21.470] 你知道，当你变得更精瘦的时候，你会非常严格地节食，限制卡路里摄入等等。我觉得在某些方面，我生命中的某些时期或某些年份，我成长了很多，而这种成长也体现在我的身体上。
[00:41:32.510] not just like real growth, but I mean like expanded my worldview and like Opened up a lot to a lot of new things and then there were years in my life where I felt like I really streamlined things that I enjoyed things I wanted to do and
[00:41:32.510] 不仅仅是真正的成长，我的意思是拓展了我的世界观，让我接触到了很多新事物。然后，有几年时间，我感觉自己真正精简了自己喜欢的事情和想做的事情。
[00:41:46.190] Really prioritize and like focus on cutting down on things that truly matter to me So I feel like there is kind of like that up and down in terms of like my past years So I wonder what kind of year this will be. Whoa
[00:41:46.190] 我真的会把重心放在真正重要的事情上，专注于减少不必要的开支。所以我觉得过去几年我的生活状态有点起伏不定，不知道今年会是怎样的一年。哇！
[00:42:00.070] What was last year then? That's a good question, I think last year for me maybe was bulking Mmm, I can totally say that. I think I was maybe about bulking as well I felt like I did a lot of new things even despite like wedding planning and stuff
[00:42:00.070] 那去年是什么样的呢？问得好，我觉得去年对我来说可能是增肌期。嗯，我完全同意。我觉得我去年可能也在增肌，感觉我做了很多新的事情，即使像筹备婚礼之类的。
[00:42:19.470] But I don't know. I'm kind of getting like cutting season vibes Maybe cuz like if we did a lot last year then now it's like, okay Let's you know bring our focus back in on right like what we want to do this year and stuff
[00:42:19.470] 但我不知道。我感觉有点像是在收尾。可能是因为如果我们去年做了很多事，那么现在就感觉，好吧，让我们把注意力重新集中到我们今年想做的事情上吧。
[00:42:34.510] well always fun to yap about our random deep thoughts and crises I Feel like half of it is yapping. We're just like saying the same thing to each other and we're like, yeah, totally Like in there, there's some treasure. We're like, oh my god
[00:42:34.510] 嗯，跟人闲聊那些随机的深刻想法和危机总是很有趣，感觉有一半时间都在闲聊。我们就像在重复同样的话，然后就说，是啊，完全正确。感觉里面好像藏着什么宝藏。我们就会想，我的天哪
[00:42:50.990] We're like that was so deep But for our listeners out there You should tell us if you had a bulking year or a slimming year and what your plan is for this year bulking or slimming year as usually you can find us on
