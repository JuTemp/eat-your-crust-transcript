[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal. So before we jump into our topic this week, I actually have a little mini funny story to share. And it always makes me nervous when I call something a funny story because I'm like, what if it's not actually funny? So I'll just say I have a story to share.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。在正式进入本周话题之前，我先想分享一个小小的趣事。每次我把某件事称为“趣事”的时候，我都会有点紧张，因为我会想，万一它其实并不好笑呢？所以，我就简单地说，我有一个故事要分享。
[00:00:28.570] Okay, okay. Don't worry, I'll laugh. So basically, yesterday was Sunday and James and I walked around our downtown area a little bit and then we grabbed dinner at this new little local joint that opened. And then afterwards, we took a little stroll around downtown. We stumbled upon the store and it looked brand new. And all I could see from afar through the windows was like it was really bright inside
[00:00:28.570] 好吧好吧，别担心，我会笑的。事情是这样的，昨天是星期天，我和詹姆斯在市中心附近逛了一会儿，然后去了一家新开的小餐馆吃晚饭。之后，我们又在市中心闲逛了一会儿。我们偶然发现了这家店，它看起来崭新锃亮。我从远处透过橱窗看到里面灯火通明。
[00:00:54.810] and kind of like an artsy display. You know those stores where there's like a line to get in and once you get in, there's only like 10 products on the shelf or something? Yeah. It kind of looked upscale like that. So we were theorizing about what kind of store it was. And I could see these puffy kind of cloud installations inside the store and other like lamp fixtures. So I was like, dude, that's a lamp store. And James was like, there's no way that's a
[00:00:54.810] 有点像那种艺术气息浓厚的陈列店。你知道那种店吗？门口排着长队，进去之后货架上就只有十来件商品？对，看起来有点高档。所以我们就在猜测这到底是什么类型的店。我看到店里有一些蓬松的云朵状装置，还有一些灯具之类的东西。我就说，哥们儿，这肯定是家灯具店。詹姆斯却说，不可能吧……
[00:01:20.570] lamp store because why would a lamp store be so nice and have three lamps inside? And I was like, okay, that's fair. So the whole time we're walking towards it and we're like trying to guess what it is. And then we finally see it. And the name of the store is very like discreet, but we eventually realized that it's a plant store, like a special plant store. I see. You know, we're intrigued and we've spent all this time like thinking about the store. So we go in, you know, it was really nice
[00:01:20.570] 灯具店，因为一家灯具店怎么会这么漂亮，里面却只有三盏灯呢？我当时就想，好吧，这倒也说得通。所以我们一路走过去，一直在猜测它到底是什么店。最后终于看到了。店名很隐晦，但我们最终意识到它是一家植物店，一家很特别的植物店。原来如此。你知道，我们很好奇，而且之前一直在想这家店。所以我们就进去了，你知道，里面真的很不错。
[00:01:49.350] and like very clean and all of that. We had like waited a little bit in line to like even get into the store. So we were like, okay, fuck, we should probably buy something. Otherwise, we just wasted all that time in line for no reason. So we bought something, they gave us like a little bag. And it was like a really, really nice bag for a plant store. But it had the logo and like the label and like all of it was very clear on like what exactly you were buying. So it wasn't a very
[00:01:49.350] 而且店里非常干净整洁。我们排了一会儿队才进店。所以我们就想，好吧，算了，我们应该买点东西。不然的话，我们排队的时间就白费了。所以我们买了一些东西，他们给了我们一个小袋子。对于一家植物店来说，这个袋子真的很精致。上面有logo、标签等等，所有信息都非常清楚地表明你买的是什么。所以这并不是一个……
[00:02:18.530] secretive or like subtle bag. So we take the bag and we're like, mildly embarrassed or whatever. We're like walking back to our car. When James says, Oh, there's actually another new special plant store. So many plant stores. I know. And this all within like half a mile or like even less, right? So he's like, yeah, like I saw it on Yelp, we should go look at it. And it was coincidentally, like right next to where
[00:02:18.530] 那是一个很隐蔽或者很不起眼的包。我们接过包，感觉有点尴尬什么的。我们正往车走。这时詹姆斯说：“哦，原来附近还有一家新的特色植物店。” 好多植物店啊。我知道。而且都在半英里甚至更近的范围内，对吧？所以他说：“是啊，我在Yelp上看到了，我们应该去看看。” 巧的是，它就在我们旁边。
[00:02:46.230] we had parked to eat at the restaurant. Okay, we go there. There's another line. This one is also like nice and clean, but like slightly smaller and maybe less artsy and like upscale and all that. But it was still fine. We also wait in line for like another 10 minutes here. And I'm just like, okay, fuck now we have to buy something. But the problem is we walked in with like the bag of the other plant store. And it's like, so clear as day where we got that bag. James is like,
[00:02:46.230] 我们把车停好准备去餐厅吃饭。好了，我们到了那里。又排了一条队。这条队也挺干净整洁的，不过稍微小一点，可能没那么文艺，也没那么高档什么的。但总体来说还不错。我们又排了大概十分钟的队。我当时就想，完了，现在我们得买点东西了。但问题是，我们进来的时候手里拿着之前在另一家植物店买的袋子。而且，袋子是从哪儿拿的，这事儿一目了然。詹姆斯说，
[00:03:13.010] you think they're gonna say anything or like notice that I have this bag? And I was like, yeah, they'll for sure like say something. And then we walk in and lo and behold, they do say something. And they're like, oh, so are you guys just testing out both stores? And is today the decision day on which one you like better? Oh my god. And me and James were just like, ha ha ha, like we just wanted to stop by. And then our faces just got like super red. And it was like mildly embarrassing as a consumer to get called out on something like that.
[00:03:13.010] 你觉得他们会说什么，或者注意到我拎着这个包吗？我就想，是啊，他们肯定会说点什么。结果我们进去之后，你猜怎么着，他们还真说了。他们问：“哦，你们是在两家店都逛逛吗？今天就是你们决定更喜欢哪家的日子吗？”我的天哪。我和詹姆斯当时就哈哈大笑，说我们只是想顺便过来看看。然后我们俩的脸都红透了。作为消费者，被人这样当面点名批评，感觉有点尴尬。
[00:03:41.050] Oh my god. That's so funny that they both had lines too. I know. Competition is fierce. Yeah, it was pretty interesting. The bag of the second plant store, it was just like a paper bag. The white paper bags where you would like put school lunch in it and stuff. And I was like, I kind of get it because it is more subtle. But then sometimes I feel like that makes it like more worse. Like, oh, you know, nothing interesting in this bag, but it's like screaming like, look at me.
[00:03:41.050] 我的天哪。他们俩居然都有台词，真是太搞笑了。我知道，竞争太激烈了。是啊，挺有意思的。第二家植物店的袋子，就是那种普通的纸袋，就是那种装午餐的白色纸袋。我当时想，我大概能理解，因为这样比较低调。但有时候我觉得这样反而更糟糕。就好像，你知道，这个袋子里没什么特别的，但它却像是在大声喊着：“快来看我！”
[00:04:10.670] It's like when you have alcohol in a brown paper bag. Like, there's definitely nothing suspicious here. Oh my god. No, that's so accurate. That was the exact feeling we had. So we just like walked back to our car clutching these two bags. Oh my god, that's so funny. So have you looked at your special plants yet? Yeah, yeah, we've been looking at the special plants. And honestly,
[00:04:10.670] 就像你用棕色纸袋装着酒一样。感觉这里面肯定没什么可疑的。我的天哪。没错，这形容太贴切了。我们当时就是这种感觉。所以我们就拎着这两个袋子走回了车里。我的天哪，这太搞笑了。你们看过你们的那些特别的植物了吗？嗯，嗯，我们一直在看那些特别的植物。说实话，
[00:04:39.070] we didn't even need a single special plant. Like we were actually set out to buy zero special plants. But now we have two. So this just shows you how me and James are like, easy customers. You know, dude, wait, I saw a TikTok yesterday. You know, like those cozy game TikToks where it's like, soft voice and it's like, oh, these are like my favorite things on my desk. Okay, so it's kind of that vibe. So it goes panning over this person's cute little desk setup. And they're like,
[00:04:39.070] 我们本来连一盆特别的植物都不需要。真的，我们一开始就打算一盆都不买。结果现在我们有两盆了。这说明我和詹姆斯都是很容易买东西的顾客。你知道吗，哥们儿，等等，我昨天在TikTok上看到一个视频。你知道，就是那种温馨的游戏TikTok，声音很轻柔，然后说，哦，这些是我桌上最喜欢的东西。好吧，就是那种感觉。镜头扫过这个人可爱的小桌子布置。然后他们说，
[00:05:09.150] today I realized that my favorite hobby as an adult is spending money. Fuck, why is that so accurate? And I was like, oh my god, that is me too. That's what your story reminds me of. I feel like this is also one of the reasons why I can't do those things where it's like, oh, you can stay at this hotel for free if you just go to our timeshare presentation or something.
[00:05:09.150] 今天我突然意识到，我成年后最喜欢的爱好竟然是花钱。我去，怎么这么准？我当时就想，我的天，这说的也是我啊。你的故事让我想起了这一点。我觉得这也是为什么我无法接受那些“只要去参加我们的分时度假推介会就能免费入住酒店”之类的活动的原因之一。
[00:05:36.070] Because I know my ass would walk out of there with like a timeshare. You're like, wow, only X amount of dollars. That's so good. Exactly. If anything, James would just enable you. Oh, yeah. You would enable each other. We would. We would be like, oh, you get a discount for buying too? But yes, that was my Sunday evening. How about you? Do you have any funny stories that you've,
[00:05:36.070] 因为我知道我肯定会从那儿买个分时度假房。你会想，哇，才多少钱？太划算了。没错。詹姆斯肯定会怂恿你这么做。哦，对。你们会互相怂恿。我们会。我们会说，哦，买房也有折扣？没错，那就是我周日晚上的经历。你呢？你有没有什么有趣的经历？
[00:06:03.470] or I should say, do you have any stories that you've experienced recently? So I do have one. It's not happened quite yet, but by the time this episode is out, it will have already happened. Basically, right now I'm in Texas. And originally the only cities that I was going to visit were Austin and Houston. But the thing is, I have the Capital One Venture X card, which allows you to go to the Capital One Lounge.
[00:06:03.470] 或者应该说，你最近有没有什么经历可以分享？我确实有一个故事。虽然还没发生，但等这期节目播出的时候，应该已经发生了。我现在在德克萨斯州。原本我只打算去奥斯汀和休斯顿这两个城市。但问题是，我有一张 Capital One Venture X 卡，可以凭这张卡去 Capital One 贵宾休息室。
[00:06:32.930] And right now, at this point in time, 2023, there only exists one Capital One Lounge. And it's in Dallas, Fort Worth. Oh, God. So you can kind of see where this is going, right? My thoughts were that I actually was thinking about downgrading my card or closing it sometime soon because I'm thinking of upgrading to a different travel card. But the thing is, I haven't been to
[00:06:32.930] 而现在，到了2023年，Capital One只有一个贵宾休息室。它位于达拉斯-沃斯堡地区。我的天哪。所以你大概能猜到接下来会发生什么，对吧？我原本打算降级我的信用卡或者干脆销卡，因为我正在考虑升级到另一张旅行信用卡。但问题是，我还没去过……
[00:07:01.370] that lounge because it's in Texas, in Dallas, like Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, which I've never been to. Right. So since I'm in Texas right now, I was like, okay, maybe I'll just swing by Dallas. I'll fly out of Dallas later. It's actually next week, Monday. I'll be flying out of Dallas. And I had to make sure I was flying out of the right airline terminal and everything.
[00:07:01.370] 那个休息室在德克萨斯州，达拉斯，就在达拉斯-沃斯堡机场，我之前从没去过。对。既然我现在在德克萨斯州，我就想，好吧，也许我可以顺道去达拉斯看看。我之后会从达拉斯飞走。实际上是下周一。我会从达拉斯飞走。我得确保我从正确的航站楼出发，一切都安排妥当。
[00:07:29.390] So I looked it up. I was like, okay, where's the lounge? I think it was terminal D. So that means that I have to fly with American Airlines, which I normally never fly with. So I literally made like an American Airlines account so I could get the miles and everything. Oh, my God. Bought an AA flight out of Dallas. So now I will be able to experience the lounge before I close the card.
[00:07:29.390] 所以我查了一下。我就想，好吧，休息室在哪儿？我记得好像是在D航站楼。这意味着我得坐美国航空的航班，而我平时根本不坐美国航空。所以我干脆注册了一个美国航空的账户，这样就能攒里程什么的了。我的天哪。我买了张从达拉斯出发的美国航空机票。这样我就可以在注销信用卡之前体验一下休息室了。
[00:07:55.050] Dude, that is so funny. And it's also making me laugh how both of our stories are very like peak consumerism. Yeah, for sure. I was joking with my friend. I was like, yeah, I'm going to cancel my card as I am walking out of the lounge, flying out of Dallas because my task will be completed. I feel like another funny thing to me too. Sometimes when you tell me about your decisions and the things
[00:07:55.050] 老兄，这太搞笑了。而且我们俩的经历都太像消费主义的巅峰之作了，这让我觉得好笑。是啊，没错。我当时跟朋友开玩笑。我说，我要在离开休息室、飞离达拉斯的时候把信用卡注销掉，因为我的任务就完成了。这对我来说也挺有意思的。有时候你跟我讲你的决定和那些事的时候，我觉得挺搞笑的。
[00:08:22.270] that you do for like fun and stuff, I'm like, dude, Crystal's life is basically just a video game that she's playing. You know, she's like, I need to unlock this achievement. But you're so right. Oh, my God. Honestly, sometimes it really does feel like that. I'm like, I need to go on this. This is a side quest, right? The Dallas airport lounge. I'm like, I need to go on this quick side quest so that I can complete this little checkmark. So that you can unlock the new
[00:08:22.270] 你做这些只是为了好玩什么的，我就想，老兄，Crystal的生活基本上就是她在玩一款电子游戏。你知道，她会说，我得解锁这个成就。但你说得太对了。我的天哪。说真的，有时候真的感觉就是这样。我就想，我得去做这个。这是个支线任务，对吧？达拉斯机场休息室。我就想，我得去做这个小支线任务，这样我才能完成这个小勾选。这样你才能解锁新的
[00:08:51.830] credit card mission. Also, there's a funny moment where I was at the airport in the bay flying out to Texas. And I pulled up my wallet. And I looked at it and I realized I forgot my Capital One card. Oh, my God. And I was like, wait, I don't have my card. How am I going to get into the lounge? The whole time after sitting at the gate, sitting in the airplane before takeoff and after landing, I was like
[00:08:51.830] 信用卡任务。还有一件趣事，当时我在海湾机场，准备飞往德克萨斯州。我掏出钱包，看了一眼才发现我忘了带Capital One信用卡。我的天哪！我当时就想，等等，我没带卡。我怎么进休息室啊？从在登机口等到起飞，再到飞机起飞和降落，我一直都在想着这件事。
[00:09:18.590] desperately searching. Can I still get into the lounge without my physical card? And luckily, I will be able to as long as I have the Capital One app, which I do have. So we're good. But there was a moment where I was like, oh, my God, I really fucked up my side mission. Like this, this whole trip to Dallas, and I wouldn't even have my card. And you would just be sitting on like the regular like seats outside of the gate, like other peasants.
[00:09:18.590] 我当时真是焦急地寻找着。没有实体卡还能进休息室吗？还好，只要我有Capital One的App就能进去，而我确实有。所以没问题。但当时我真想，天哪，我这次的“支线任务”彻底泡汤了。就这么一趟达拉斯之旅，我居然连卡都没带。那我岂不是只能像其他平民一样，坐在登机口外面的普通座位上？
[00:09:48.990] It would be so sad if I had this whole leg of the trip planned and the one thing I was supposed to do, I couldn't do. Is there something specifically that you're looking forward to for that lounge? Or is it more of like, oh, I have to use this benefit at least once since I have the credit card? Yeah, I think that's one of the big things. Like I want to be able to use that benefit at least once. Because I've used pretty much all the other benefits. That's been enough time for me to decide like,
[00:09:48.990] 如果我把整个行程都计划好了，结果唯一一件我一定要做的事却做不了，那该有多遗憾啊。你对那个贵宾休息室有什么特别期待的吗？还是说，因为我有这张信用卡，所以至少得用一次这个权益？嗯，我觉得这是最重要的事之一。我至少想用一次这个权益。因为其他权益我都用完了。时间足够让我好好想想了。
[00:10:14.610] oh, I think I want a different travel card. Otherwise, also, the Capital One lounge is supposed to be pretty nice. So I think Capital One lounges is supposed to be kind of similar, a little more similar to the Amex level of like super nice, luxurious. So I was like, okay, I want to sit in a fancy lounge. I have the card. Why can't I, right? Right, right. It's just sad that it's only in Dallas. Hey, well, at least you get to do it. And it ended up kind of working out before you cancel your card.
[00:10:14.610] 哦，我想我需要一张不同的旅行信用卡。另外，Capital One 的贵宾休息室据说很不错。我觉得 Capital One 的贵宾休息室应该跟 Amex 的差不多，超级棒，超级豪华。所以我就想，好吧，我想去高级贵宾休息室坐坐。我有这张卡，为什么不能去呢？对，对。可惜的是，它只在达拉斯有。不过，至少你还能去。而且在你取消信用卡之前，这件事最终还是解决了。
[00:10:44.290] That's true. Yeah. By the time this episode is out, I will have enjoyed the lounge and maybe my card will already be gone. Well, you'll have to report back on how nice the lounge was. But let's kind of jump back into our topic of the week today, which is getting a new therapist. So we talked a little bit about our experiences with our therapists in the past. But I know Crystal, you've recently gotten a new one.
[00:10:44.290] 没错。是啊。等这期节目播出的时候，我应该已经享受过休息室了，说不定我的卡都用完了。嗯，到时候你得回来汇报一下休息室到底怎么样。不过，咱们还是回到今天的话题吧，那就是找个新的心理咨询师。我们之前聊了聊各自过去和心理咨询师的经历。我知道克丽丝塔尔，你最近也换了个新的心理咨询师。
[00:11:13.690] So let's talk a little bit about that. How has the whole experience of getting a new therapist been for you? It's been kind of interesting. I think ever since I moved back to the Bay, it's been in the back of my mind like, oh, I should find a new therapist. And we kind of explained in one of the earlier episodes why I had to stop seeing my therapist in New York. TLDR is basically that most therapists are
[00:11:13.690] 所以我们来聊聊这个吧。你换心理咨询师的整个过程感觉如何？挺有意思的。自从我搬回湾区后，就一直想着要找个新的心理咨询师。我们在之前的节目里也解释过我为什么不得不停止在纽约的咨询。简单来说，就是大多数心理咨询师……
[00:11:37.230] only licensed for one state that they reside in or like work in. So since I was moving out of New York state, that therapist wasn't licensed to therapize me in California. So she was just like, yeah, I can give you recs if you want recs. But otherwise, like, unfortunately, we will just have to stop. And I was like, okay, bye. So yeah, definitely, like, since I moved back in the back of my mind, I've been thinking
[00:11:37.230] 他们只在自己居住或工作的州获得执照。因为我要搬出纽约州，那位治疗师没有加州的执照，所以她就说：“如果你需要推荐，我可以给你推荐。但除此之外，很遗憾，我们只能到此为止了。” 我当时就说：“好的，再见。” 所以，自从我搬回来之后，我一直在想这件事。
[00:12:03.030] about finding a new therapist. And I did do some searching. But for a while, for like, a good maybe five or so months, what I was looking for exactly wasn't coming up. So there were mainly three things that I'd look for. The first thing I look for is that they're a person of color, preferably Asian
[00:12:03.030] 关于寻找新的心理咨询师。我确实做了一些搜索。但有一段时间，大概有五个月左右，我一直没找到完全符合我要求的。我主要关注三点。第一点是，咨询师必须是少数族裔，最好是亚裔。
[00:12:28.090] American, just because I think that makes it a lot easier for them to understand and relate. If I were to talk about like family or identity issues. Right. Second thing is, I prefer a woman because I myself am a woman. So I think, you know, once again, the like relating thing, it's just easier. I think especially because I've heard this from other people before too, where they're like,
[00:12:28.090] 之所以选择美国人，是因为我觉得这样更容易让他们理解和产生共鸣。如果我要谈论家庭或身份认同之类的问题，那就更容易了。对。第二点是，我更喜欢女性，因为我自己就是女性。所以我觉得，你知道，再说一遍，说到产生共鸣这件事，女性更容易。尤其是我之前也听其他人说过类似的话，他们会说，
[00:12:53.690] if I'm like a woman in therapy, let's say I, I'm like scared of men or something. Like, how would I tell my male therapist that right? So I feel like most women want like a woman therapist as well. And then the third thing was I wanted to do in person therapy in the Bay because in New York, it was completely remote because it was convenient at the time. And we were still just coming out of the pandemic for a while. So it is just like what worked best at the time. So yeah, I was like,
[00:12:53.690] 如果我像个接受心理治疗的女性一样，比如说，我害怕男性之类的。那我该怎么跟我的男治疗师说呢？我觉得大多数女性也希望找个女治疗师。第三点是，我想在湾区进行面对面的治疗，因为当时在纽约完全是远程治疗，远程治疗比较方便。而且我们当时还在疫情初期。所以，这完全取决于当时哪种方式最合适。所以，是的，我当时就想，
[00:13:23.670] I want to sit on a couch and like have a therapist write notes on me on clipboard and stuff. Right. So those are the three things I was looking for. And it took a while I would check periodically with the tool that I use to find therapists. And for a while, nothing that was fitting all three was matching. And so I just like, I kept waiting until finally, it was about May, I believe,
[00:13:23.670] 我想坐在沙发上，让治疗师用写字板给我做笔记什么的。对。这就是我想要的三件事。我花了一段时间，时不时地用我用来找治疗师的工具查看。有一段时间，没有一个治疗师符合这三点。所以我就一直等，直到最后，大概是五月份吧，我想。
[00:13:51.110] April or May, that someone popped up that like fit all my needs. And so I signed up immediately. Oh, exciting. Yeah. So was your first session with her in person? Yeah, it was. So my current therapist, there's in-person sessions available and remote sessions available. So usually we just do in person, but sometimes we'll do remote if it's like she's not
[00:13:51.110] 四五月份的时候，突然冒出来一个完全符合我所有需求的人。所以我立刻就报了名。哦，真令人兴奋。是啊。那你第一次和她见面是面对面的吗？是的。我现在的心理咨询师提供面对面和远程两种咨询方式。所以通常我们都是面对面咨询，但有时候如果她不在，我们也会进行远程咨询。
[00:14:17.110] going to be in the office or it'll be easier to do remote. And also like a few episodes back where I explained, she was like, oh shoot, can we do remote today? And then I had to like take the call in a phone booth. But for the most part, we do in person, just as I hoped. So since you had a therapist that you worked with for a while in New York, and this is a new therapist that you're kind of getting to know, how did the whole process go for like the context building
[00:14:17.110] 要么去办公室，要么远程办公更方便。就像前几集里我解释过的那样，她当时就说，哎呀，我们今天能远程办公吗？然后我就得去电话亭接电话。不过大多数情况下，我们还是会面对面进行，正如我所希望的那样。你之前在纽约和一位治疗师合作了一段时间，现在这位是你正在熟悉的新治疗师，那么你们建立联系的整个过程是怎样的呢？
[00:14:45.650] part, even coming up with issues? Because I feel like if you have some sort of rapport going on with your therapist already, you know, sessions are kind of like a continuation of what you talked about last time, or maybe there's like recurring themes and stuff. But with a new therapist, it's like brand new, right? So how did that whole like introductory process go? Yeah, that's actually so interesting, because I never specified this, but my previous therapist,
[00:14:45.650] 甚至在咨询过程中遇到问题？因为我觉得，如果你和你的咨询师已经建立了一定的默契，那么每次咨询就像是上次谈话内容的延续，或者会有一些反复出现的主题之类的。但是和新的咨询师见面，一切都是全新的，对吧？那么整个介绍过程进行得怎么样？嗯，这真的很有意思，因为我之前没有具体提到过，但我之前的咨询师……
[00:15:12.650] a lot of the things that we talked about was relationship oriented, because I basically started therapy after a breakup from a really long term relationship. So a lot of the things we talked about was very personal, I guess, emotional, you know, like just relationship related. So I feel like because of that, the fact that it was like so specific, the initial reason for starting therapy
[00:15:12.650] 我们谈的很多事情都和感情有关，因为我基本上是在结束一段很长的感情关系后才开始接受心理治疗的。所以我们谈的很多事情都很私人，很情绪化，你知道，就是和感情有关。我觉得正因为如此，我最初开始接受心理治疗的原因才如此具体。
[00:15:36.510] was so specific, it helped kickstart the beginning a lot. It was just like, okay, like we're jumping in, we're like talking about this. And then it made us, I guess, like bond quicker, maybe. And then so for this current therapist, though, I don't think I had as much of a like, specific thing. I don't know about you. But for my therapist, I filled out a questionnaire. And at the end of it, it was like,
[00:15:36.510] 因为它非常具体，所以对开启咨询过程起到了很大的帮助。感觉就像，好吧，我们直接切入正题，开始讨论这个问题。然后，我想，它可能让我们更快地建立起联系。不过，对于我现在的这位咨询师，我觉得我没有那么具体的想法。我不知道你们怎么样。但我的咨询师给我填了一份问卷。问卷最后是这样的：
[00:16:03.450] what brought you to therapy, basically, what I filled that out with was a lot less specific than with my first therapist. So I feel like with the new one, there's like more of a, I don't know, like a slow buildup. Because to get to know each other in the beginning, we kind of just went through the questionnaire and like covered some of the more basic things, like what have you been feeling lately, like blah, blah, blah. And then she'll always ask about like, okay, so like, these are
[00:16:03.450] 关于“是什么让你来接受治疗”这个问题，我填写的内容基本上比我之前的治疗师那份要笼统得多。所以我觉得和这位新的治疗师相处，感觉更像是一种循序渐进的过程。因为一开始为了互相了解，我们只是简单地填写了问卷，聊了一些比较基本的问题，比如你最近的感受等等。然后她总是会问一些更具体的问题，比如，这些都是……
[00:16:31.110] things that you said you want to come to therapy for. So you know, let's talk about any of these topics, which one do you want to do? It's kind of weird, because it's like, whoa, I don't know how to start this. That's true. I can totally imagine how you went from like, oh my god, so many updates or like so many feelings, because everything was probably very like fresh and raw and like ongoing. Yeah. Whereas when the stuff you want to talk about is maybe more like, simmered down to like
[00:16:31.110] 你之前说过你想来接受治疗的原因。所以，我们来聊聊这些话题吧，你想聊哪个？这感觉有点奇怪，因为你会想，哇，我不知道该怎么开始。确实如此。我完全可以想象你当时的心情，一开始你会觉得，天哪，好多事情要说，或者说，好多感受，因为一切都可能很新鲜、很直接，而且还在持续进行中。是啊。而当你想要谈论的事情可能已经比较平淡，比如……
[00:16:57.950] a lower temperature. It's not necessarily like, oh, I have these three things on my agenda for therapy today. The first couple ones we just went through, I think she has a bit of a set list that we talk about, just like get a very basic understanding of her patients. So some things like, oh, you know, how's your family life? How have you been feeling at work lately? How's personal life? Like your friends, relationship, things like that. That took about like two sessions.
[00:16:57.950] 体温降低。这并不是说，哦，我今天的治疗计划里有这三件事。我们刚才谈的那几件事，我觉得她有一份固定的谈话清单，我们会围绕这些话题进行一些基本的了解。比如，哦，你知道，你的家庭生活怎么样？你最近在工作中感觉如何？你的个人生活怎么样？比如你的朋友、感情关系等等。这些大概花了两次咨询的时间。
[00:17:25.410] And we touched upon like some personal history and things like that. I don't know, I guess like, it's very interesting, because I think I've had maybe like four or five sessions with her. But they've been not super regular. Sometimes I'll be like two weeks in a row. And then like, two weeks break, two weeks in a row again, and then like three weeks break because of like traveling.
[00:17:25.410] 我们还聊到了一些个人经历之类的。我不知道，我觉得挺有意思的，因为我大概跟她咨询过四五次。但咨询时间不太规律。有时候我会连续两周，然后休息两周，再连续两周，然后因为旅行之类的原因，又会休息三周。
[00:17:49.410] So I think because it hasn't been too regular in terms of cadence, it's still a little we're getting to know each other. It's like your first few dates with this new therapist. Yeah, yeah. And then the like breaks in between, it almost feels like starting over sometimes. Like you have a couple of breaks in the middle. So actually, in July, I'm traveling for a bit. And then she's also out of town for a bit. So we're just not going to have any sessions in July.
[00:17:49.410] 所以我觉得是因为咨询频率不太规律，我们还在互相了解。就像你和新心理咨询师的头几次约会一样。对，对。然后咨询之间会有间隔，有时候感觉就像重新开始。就像中间有几次中断。实际上，七月份我要出差一段时间。她也要出差一段时间。所以七月份我们不会进行任何咨询。
[00:18:19.090] And I was like, whoa, we're going to see each other next in August. Like, are we going to be okay? Will we stand the test of distance and time? Why LDR with my therapist? I kind of know what you mean, though, because I was reflecting back on like my first few dates with my therapist. And if I had to specify like a certain time point where I started to really
[00:18:19.090] 我当时就想，哇，我们八月份才能再见面。我们能行吗？我们能经受住距离和时间的考验吗？为什么我要和我的心理咨询师谈异地恋？不过，我有点明白你的意思，因为我也在回想我和心理咨询师最初几次约会的经历。如果非要我指出一个具体的时间点，那就是我开始真正……
[00:18:47.330] lean on and look forward to my therapy sessions, not to say that I didn't look forward to them before, but it's like, there is kind of like a turning point where you can start to really trust your therapist. And for me, I feel like that point is when they say something that like blows your mind a little bit. That point probably came maybe like four to five months into our sessions. So it took a while. Yeah, it definitely did take a while. And she always had a lot of really insightful things
[00:18:47.330] 我开始依赖并期待我的治疗，倒不是说我以前不期待，只是感觉好像有个转折点，让你开始真正信任你的治疗师。对我来说，我觉得那个转折点就是他们说出一些让你有点震惊的话的时候。那个转折点大概是在我们治疗的四五个月后出现的。所以确实花了一段时间。是的，确实花了一段时间。而且她总是能说出很多很有见地的话。
[00:19:13.550] to say and stuff. But I feel like the true insight comes after they like really know you. For me, personally, I also have to be in a space where I'm ready to take advice. Or I feel like I also need to like gain faith in this person's authority to be able to take that advice. Yeah, that was kind of the turning point for me. I guess it's probably I'm guessing it's a little bit early with your current therapist. But did you have a turning point like that with your previous therapist?
[00:19:13.550] 可以说很多话。但我感觉真正的洞察力来自于他们真正了解你之后。就我个人而言，我也必须处于一种能够接受建议的状态。或者说，我觉得我需要对这个人的权威性建立信任，才能接受他们的建议。是的，那对我来说算是一个转折点。我猜你现在和你的治疗师可能还处于早期阶段。但你和之前的治疗师之间有过类似的转折点吗？
[00:19:38.710] I think a little bit, actually. I think like she gave me a suggestion of like an activity I could do to help me be more in tune with racing thoughts and emotions, I guess at the time. And I tried it and I was like, Oh, I felt like it was like helpful. My previous therapist was more of a like, she'll sit there and like listen as I give her all my updates, spit out all my words and stuff. And then she'll
[00:19:38.710] 我觉得确实有点儿。我记得她当时建议我做一些活动，帮助我更好地觉察自己纷乱的思绪和情绪。我试了一下，感觉还挺有帮助的。我之前的治疗师更像是那种会坐在那里，听我倾诉所有近况，把所有想说的话都一股脑儿地倒出来。然后她……
[00:20:05.230] just be like, Oh, yes, seems like blah, blah, blah, just kind of summarize what I said to her. So then basically, I think that style makes you feel really like validated and seen or heard, which really worked out well during that period of time in my life. But I guess towards the end, it like loses steam a bit because you're like, Okay, well, I guess like, I'm okay now. Like, I don't have too much to
[00:20:05.230] 就跟她说：“哦，是的，好像是……巴拉巴拉……”，大概总结一下我跟她说过的话。所以我觉得这种方式会让你感觉自己被认可、被理解、被倾听，这在我人生的那段时间真的很有帮助。但我觉得到了后期，这种方式就有点后劲不足了，因为你会想：“好吧，我想我现在没事了。我没什么可说的了。”
[00:20:30.370] to say anymore. Not only did we break up because of me moving. But also things kind of just came to like a natural end to I was like, Yeah, I guess I got most of the things that I wanted to say out there. And my therapist was able to like, listen and be like, Yeah, totally. Right. Yeah, I definitely think that's like, one of the components that I love about therapy is like
[00:20:30.370] 没什么好说的了。我们分手不仅是因为我搬家，而且感觉一切都顺其自然地结束了。我想，嗯，我想说的话大部分都说完了。我的治疗师能够倾听，然后说，是啊，完全正确。没错，我确实觉得这是我喜欢心理治疗的原因之一。
[00:20:55.970] having someone sit there and like, listen, and just like, kind of hear you for like what you're saying. But I totally agree that you also need the other part where they are giving you new insights and like are giving you new suggestions that can actually like help change your thoughts. Because sometimes I'm not gonna lie. And this probably makes me sound like a horrible patient. But sometimes I'm like, I could probably tell myself this or even when I'm like spiraling, for example, I'm spiraling in a loop
[00:20:55.970] 有人坐在那里，认真倾听，理解你说的话，这很重要。但我完全同意，你也需要另一部分，那就是他们能给你新的见解和建议，这些建议真的能帮助你改变想法。因为有时候，我不会撒谎。这话可能听起来像个糟糕的病人。但有时候我会想，我或许可以这样告诉自己，或者当我陷入恶性循环的时候，比如，我感觉自己像在螺旋式地循环往复。
[00:21:24.070] where I'm like therapizing myself or trying to at least write like trying to bring myself back down to reason things that therapists sometimes say I'm like, Yeah, I know. And I've told myself that and the reason why I spiraled further is because I thought this and like, there's like all these thoughts that I already had before going into therapy. So I feel like that moment of like breaking that loop needs to happen. Otherwise, I would just be my own therapist. You know what I mean?
[00:21:24.070] 我感觉自己像是在自我疗愈，或者至少试着写点东西，让自己冷静下来，理智地思考一些治疗师有时会说的话。我会想，是啊，我知道。我也告诉过自己这些话，而我之所以会陷入更深的漩涡，就是因为我这样想，而且，在接受治疗之前，我脑子里就已经有很多这样的想法了。所以我感觉，我需要打破这个循环。否则，我就只能自己给自己当治疗师了。你明白我的意思吗？
[00:21:49.690] Yeah, like they need to help you break that loop or like give a suggestion that can hopefully help you break that loop. Yeah, definitely. I think also with my current therapist, I'm in like a different place in my life. So we talk about different things in therapy now versus like me last year. And I think it has potential to be deeper than like, what my previous therapy sessions look like. Not to say that it was like,
[00:21:49.690] 是啊，他们需要帮你打破那个恶性循环，或者给你一些建议，希望能帮你打破那个循环。没错，绝对是这样。我觉得我现在的治疗师也跟我人生阶段不太一样了。所以我们现在在治疗中谈论的内容跟去年不一样了。我觉得它有可能比我之前的治疗更深入。当然，这并不是说之前的治疗就一定很肤浅。
[00:22:17.550] oh, my previous therapist didn't dig deep into my thoughts and stuff. It's more like now my brain is occupied by other things that are maybe like more deeply set into me versus like the immediate issue at the time. So I feel like because of that, maybe it's also like a little slower to or at least it feels a little slower to like build up because it's like, okay, when when will I feel ready to really like
[00:22:17.550] 哦，我之前的心理咨询师并没有深入挖掘我的想法和内心活动。现在我的大脑似乎被其他一些根深蒂固的事情占据了，而不是当下的问题。所以我觉得正因为如此，我的心理疗愈过程可能比较慢，或者至少感觉上比较慢，因为我会想，好吧，我什么时候才能真正准备好呢？
[00:22:44.970] share something like this or like that or whatever? Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't think about how you also have to like open up and be able to reveal certain things about yourself, too, because I think I might have said this on the initial therapy episode that we did. But I definitely had my guard up for a little bit, where I was like, do I really want to talk about this? Or like, you know, I can talk about the issue. But how deep do
[00:22:44.970] 分享一些类似这样或那样的事情？嗯，你说得对。我之前没考虑到你也需要敞开心扉，能够透露一些关于你自己的事情，因为我觉得我可能在我们第一次的治疗节目里说过这一点。但我当时确实有点戒备，我在想，我真的想谈论这件事吗？或者说，我知道我可以谈论这个问题，但要谈到什么程度呢？
[00:23:11.370] I want to go into like my own thoughts and worries and like anxieties? Or do I just want to steer the conversation a certain way so that I don't have to talk about certain things? Right? Right. Because I think there's like, things that at a service level, you know, it's trauma, and you can call it trauma. And then there's also like your deepest, darkest things that you might not want to reveal. And it takes a while for those to feel ready to share, I guess. So I totally get
[00:23:11.370] 我想深入探讨我自己的想法、担忧和焦虑吗？还是我只想引导谈话走向某个方向，这样我就不必谈论某些事情了？对吧？对。因为我觉得有些事情，从服务层面来说，你知道，那就是创伤，你可以称之为创伤。然后还有一些你内心深处最黑暗的事情，你可能不想透露。我想，你需要一段时间才能准备好分享这些。所以我完全理解。
[00:23:36.190] what you mean. Yeah, I think one of my breakthrough points was I had a certain insecurity that I like hated talking about. And it was like, to the point where I would never even journal about it, because I didn't want to acknowledge its existence. And then once during therapy, it just like came spilling out. And then I was like, you know, but then I was like, okay, well, if I were to share this, like, this is like the forum to do it. And then we ended up like working through it. And I was
[00:23:36.190] 你什么意思？嗯，我觉得我的一个突破点是，我内心深处有一种不安全感，我特别讨厌谈论它。甚至到了我从来不写日记的地步，因为我不想承认它的存在。然后有一次在心理治疗中，它就突然爆发了。然后我就想，好吧，既然我要分享这件事，这或许是个合适的平台。然后我们最终一起解决了这个问题。
[00:24:02.050] like, oh, okay, this is literally why people go to therapy. Wait, that's awesome. But I totally get what you mean. Like some of the issues, you're just like, no, if I don't think about it, and I don't acknowledge it, then I can just cover it. Yeah, sweep it under the rug. Actually, me and my therapist, my new one, we talked about sweeping things under the rug. But anyway, I totally get
[00:24:02.050] 哦，好吧，原来这就是人们去看心理医生的原因。等等，太棒了。但我完全明白你的意思。有些问题，你会想，不，如果我不去想它，不去承认它，我就能把它掩盖起来。对，把它扫到地毯下。实际上，我和我的心理医生，我的新医生，我们讨论过把事情扫到地毯下这件事。总之，我完全理解。
[00:24:29.150] what you mean, though. And I think like, along the lines of vulnerability and stuff, I think it also just takes some time for anyone to feel comfortable with anyone else, like therapy or not, to share more about yourself, because there's always the fear of slight judgment, right? And even though you literally pay therapists to not judge us, there's still like kind of that inevitable thought, right?
[00:24:29.150] 你的意思我明白了。我觉得，就脆弱感之类的方面而言，每个人都需要一些时间才能对别人感到自在，无论是否接受过治疗，才能更坦诚地分享自己的事情，因为总会害怕被评判，对吧？即使你付钱给治疗师就是为了让他们不评判你，但那种想法还是会不可避免地出现，对吧？
[00:24:56.590] Like, oh, God, what if I share this? And my therapist is like, what the fuck? Like, you're too fucked up even for me. Wait, no, that's exactly right. It's like, there's still a person, you know? Yeah. So you still have that fear. I think that's like, probably the biggest thing that I'm getting close to with this therapist, like getting more and more vulnerable bit by bit, and then feeling more
[00:24:56.590] 比如，天哪，如果我把这些说出来怎么办？然后我的心理咨询师会说，搞什么鬼？感觉你太糟糕了，连我都受不了。等等，不对，你说得对。感觉就像，你还是个人，你知道吗？是啊。所以你还是会有那种恐惧。我觉得这大概是我和这位心理咨询师之间最接近的一点，就是一点一点地变得越来越脆弱，然后感觉越来越……
[00:25:22.350] comfortable to the point where I'm like, oh, okay, like, if I say this, she probably won't judge me. I think right now, I'm probably like a little polished in our sessions. If you know what I mean? I'm like, okay, I'll share these certain things. And sometimes I'm like, oh my God, nice. I did this thing that we talked about in therapy last week. So I can tell her how I successfully, you know,
[00:25:22.350] 现在感觉很自在，就像，哦，好吧，如果我说这些，她可能不会评判我。我觉得我现在在咨询中可能有点过于自信了。你明白我的意思吗？我会想，好吧，我会分享这些事情。有时候我会想，天哪，真好。我做了我们上周在咨询中讨论过的那件事。所以我可以告诉她我是如何成功地，你知道，
[00:25:44.710] like pulled it off and then she'll think I'm great. Best client ever. That also made me kind of reflect on my relationship with therapy kind of. And I realized that in therapy, you've mentioned this before that you like to make your therapist laugh. Right. Well, I like to make my therapist compliment me.
[00:25:44.710] 就像我成功了一样，然后她就会觉得我很棒。史上最佳客户。这也让我开始反思我和心理咨询师的关系。我意识到，在咨询中，你之前也说过你喜欢逗你的咨询师笑。对。嗯，我喜欢让我的咨询师夸奖我。
[00:26:11.190] You're like, aren't you proud? Aren't you proud? Wait, literally. Like one of the most recent examples I can think of is we talked about anxiety grounding techniques, how to like bring yourself back down from anxious moments. So that particular time I had a session, two sessions back to back like weekly. So second week I go in and I'm like, oh my God, like I have a great story to tell you. I was spiraling
[00:26:11.190] 你会想，你不觉得自豪吗？你不觉得自豪吗？等等，我是认真的。我能想到的最近的一个例子是，我们讨论了焦虑缓解技巧，也就是如何让自己从焦虑中平静下来。那段时间我做了两次疗程，每周一次，连续两次。第二周我去的时候，我就想，天哪，我有很多故事要跟你们讲。我当时情绪非常低落。
[00:26:38.610] and having a bit of anxiety and I did what you like what we talked about last week. And I like grounded myself and I felt a lot better after. And she was like, wow, like I'm so glad you did that. Like good job. I was like, yes. Oh my God. That's so funny. I feel like because we seek different things from our therapist in our own inner desires, like what I'm super happy about is like totally different from you. Recently, I feel
[00:26:38.610] 我当时有点焦虑，就做了你上周跟我聊的那件事。我让自己平静下来，之后感觉好多了。她就说，哇，真高兴你这么做了，做得好。我说，是啊。我的天哪，这太逗了。我觉得，因为我们每个人从治疗师那里寻求的东西，以及我们内心真正渴望的东西，都不一样，比如我特别开心的事情，可能跟你完全不一样。最近，我感觉
[00:27:07.030] like my therapist and I have been kind of closer or like being more personal and stuff in our sessions. I was like, oh my God, did I like break down her wall a little bit? Or is this just how she is with like, you know, older clients? Because she started sharing stories, short stories, but like brief mentions about her personal life and how it relates to mine. And then she also started having less of that like therapist shell of like, oh, I'm like a neutral party kind of. I shared some story. I was
[00:27:07.030] 我和我的治疗师之间的关系好像变得更亲近了，或者说，我们在咨询过程中更愿意敞开心扉，聊一些私人的事情。我当时就想，天哪，我是不是稍微打破了她的心防？还是说她对年纪大一些的客户就是这样？因为她开始跟我分享一些故事，一些小故事，但只是简单地提及她的个人生活以及这些故事与我的经历之间的联系。然后，她也开始卸下治疗师那种“我只是个中立的第三方”的架子。我分享了一些故事。
[00:27:36.750] like, oh yeah, like, isn't this fucked up? And she's like, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. And I was like, oh my God, wait, that's awesome. I know. I was like, are we besties now? Like, holy shit. Dude, I look forward to when I reach that point. Okay. That also makes me think like, do our therapists also have like mini milestones for like breaking down walls with their clients? Does our therapist go home and talk to their husband
[00:27:36.750] 就像，哦，是啊，这难道不糟糕吗？然后她就说，是啊，确实很糟糕。我就想，我的天哪，等等，这太棒了。我知道。我就想，我们现在是闺蜜了吗？我的天哪。老兄，我期待着达到那个阶段。好吧。这也让我想到，我们的心理咨询师是不是也有一些小里程碑，比如帮助客户打破隔阂？我们的心理咨询师回家后会和丈夫聊聊吗？
[00:28:03.670] or their partner? And they're like, oh my God, my client cussed in our session today. Like, you know, I think she's really opening up to me. Why is that so funny? But I feel like so true. Because now that I think about it, I don't think I've sworn in my sessions yet. You need to drop some F-bombs. Dude, you're right. I'll prepare some stories with some F-bombs.
[00:28:03.670] 或者他们的伴侣？然后他们会说，我的天哪，我的客户今天在咨询中爆粗口了。你知道吗，我觉得她真的在跟我敞开心扉。为什么这这么好笑？但我感觉这话太对了。因为现在想想，我好像还没在咨询中说过脏话呢。你得说点脏话。兄弟，你说得对。我得准备一些带脏话的故事。
[00:28:32.370] Think of some dramatic stuff. And I'll have to tie in with me doing something right that we talked about in therapy. So that you and your therapist can exchange achievement milestones. Yeah, exactly. But I do think there's a lot of history building as well as just like vulnerability buildup. It's been about like four or five sessions in. We've talked about a decent amount,
[00:28:32.370] 想想一些戏剧性的事情。我得把这件事跟我们之前在治疗中讨论过的我做对的事情联系起来。这样你和你的治疗师就可以交流彼此取得的成就里程碑。是的，没错。但我确实认为这其中有很多历史积累，也有很多脆弱感的累积。大概已经进行了四五次治疗了。我们谈了很多，
[00:28:58.190] but at the same time, it's like, oh, we've just like scraped the surface of one topic kind of, but there's still other things that haven't even touched yet. That makes sense. And I think that's like when therapy starts to get and feel really good too. When your therapist is like, oh yeah, like you mentioned this before or like, oh, I remember this pattern or something from like the past sessions. And you're like, oh my God, yes,
[00:28:58.190] 但与此同时，感觉就像，哦，我们好像只是浅尝辄止地探讨了一个话题，还有很多其他方面我们甚至还没触及。这很合理。我觉得这就是治疗开始变得有效、感觉真正好起来的时候。当你的治疗师说，哦，对，你之前提到过这个，或者，哦，我记得你以前的治疗中提到过这种模式之类的。你会想，哦，天哪，是的。
[00:29:24.250] we're getting to like the good part of therapy. You're like, yes, tell me what's wrong with me. Yeah, exactly. I was thinking recently reflecting back on my sessions and I was like, we've made some like decent progress in this particular subject area. But then I was like, dude, but we haven't even gotten to like the juicy gossip part of my life. My life probably seems pretty boring to her right
[00:29:24.250] 我们开始喜欢上心理治疗的积极一面了。你会想，对啊，告诉我我到底哪里出了问题。没错，就是这样。我最近回顾了一下之前的治疗过程，觉得我们在这个特定领域取得了一些不错的进展。但后来我又想，老兄，我们甚至还没聊到我生活中那些劲爆的八卦呢。在她看来，我的生活可能相当无聊吧。
[00:29:51.190] now. It's just like, I feel these things. I feel like there's a whole backstory filled with like drama and like tea that she's yet to break into yet. This is also funny to me because for me, I feel like every session I like try to pack as much as I can to like get my money's worth. As I've mentioned in the past, I'm like, okay, I need to talk about like these three stories in the session. It's not like I'll watch the time, but I'll like make sure
[00:29:51.190] 现在就是这样。我能感觉到这些。我觉得她还有很多故事没讲，充满了戏剧性和八卦，但她还没来得及揭开。这对我来说也很有趣，因为我觉得每次咨询我都会尽可能多地分享内容，让咨询物有所值。就像我之前提到的，我会想，好吧，我需要在咨询中讲完这三个故事。我不会刻意控制时间，但我会确保……
[00:30:19.050] that we get to all these things in that one session. But for you, I feel like it's like, okay, intro to crystal, like crystal 101. And then you like, after you graduate from that, you can move on to crystal 102. And then you don't get to like the upper division classes or like the elective classes until later. Dude, actually though. Okay, so I feel like usually the juicy topics are like relationships with friends, romantic
[00:30:19.050] 我们可以在一次课程里学到所有这些东西。但对你来说，我觉得这就像是，好吧，水晶入门，就像水晶101。然后你学完之后，就可以去上水晶102了。之后你才能上高年级的课程或者选修课。哥们，其实……好吧，我觉得通常比较有意思的话题是朋友关系、恋爱关系之类的。
[00:30:45.830] relationships, family, you know, like just relationships in general. Right now, it's still like very me focused versus like me and my connections. So I'm like, holy shit, once we like start going into me and my connections, I feel like there's just so much more content there. And like, that's the upper divs. That's true. But you need the foundation of crystal 101 to understand that your personal
[00:30:45.830] 人际关系、家庭，你知道，就是各种人际关系。现在，人们的关注点仍然非常集中在“我”身上，而不是“我和我的人际关系”。所以我就想，天哪，一旦我们开始深入探讨“我和我的人际关系”，我觉得这里面蕴含的内容就丰富得多。而且，这确实是更高层次的内容。没错。但你需要具备水晶疗法101的基础知识才能理解，你的个人关系……
[00:31:11.610] relationship stuff. She needs to learn about the wars within myself first. Oh my god, that is hilarious. On the topic of interpersonal relationships, I think like you said, like a lot of therapy, I'm sure is focused on these things because we're like social creatures and whatnot, things that happen between us and our loved ones, like that affects us, right? In my therapy sessions, there's like a recurring cast, you know, essentially. And I've mentioned in a past episode
[00:31:11.610] 感情方面的事情。她得先了解我内心的挣扎。我的天，这太搞笑了。说到人际关系，我觉得就像你说的，很多心理治疗都会关注这些，因为我们是社会性动物，我们和爱人之间发生的事情会影响到我们，对吧？我的治疗过程中，基本上都是一些固定的“角色”。我在之前的节目里也提到过。
[00:31:38.030] that I like, never named them by name. Oh my god. Same though. But yesterday, I was like talking about this thing that happened to me recently. And I was like, oh, yeah, like this is the person who and then I like listed all the past stories I've shared about this person, so that she knows exactly who I'm talking about. Right. And then as I was doing that, I was like, am I gonna fucking do this anytime I mentioned anyone? Like I have to be like, oh, yeah, I remember this story. Remember this story?
[00:31:38.030] 我喜欢的那种人，我从来没指名道姓。我的天哪。我也是。不过昨天，我跟人聊起最近发生在我身上的一件事。然后我就说，哦，对，就是这个人，然后我就把之前跟她讲过的所有故事都列举了一遍，好让她知道我说的是谁。对。然后我一边说一边想，难道我以后每次提到别人都要这样吗？我得说，哦，对，我记得这个故事。还记得这个故事吗？
[00:32:04.490] You're giving the whole biography. Yeah, exactly. So I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna say their name because I feel like it gets confusing. And then she was like, oh, thank god. Yes, please. Like just say their name. And I was like, oh my god, like in my head, I was like, you should have said something like I didn't know. So confusing. Like such a hassle for all of us, you know? Yeah, yeah. I don't know what it is. But I totally have that too. I'm like, if we like say the name,
[00:32:04.490] 你把他们的生平都讲出来了。对，没错。所以我就想，算了，我还是直接说他们的名字吧，因为我觉得这样容易搞混。然后她就说，哦，谢天谢地。对，拜托。就直接说他们的名字。我当时就想，我的天，我心里想，你应该说“我不知道”之类的。太让人困惑了。对我们所有人来说都太麻烦了，你知道吗？是啊，是啊。我也不知道为什么。但我也有这种感觉。我就想，如果我们直接说名字，
[00:32:30.090] it like means something. I don't know. I know. I feel like it's, it's too real. At least for me, like mentally, it's like I want to focus on like the actions or like the things that happen and not necessarily like on this person. You know what I mean? Right. I don't want to like pass judgment or like, you know, add fall or like blame or whatever to like this person. It's more about like things that are happening between us that I want to talk about. So I think like part of the anonymity makes me feel
[00:32:30.090] 这好像意味着什么。我不知道。我知道。我觉得它太真实了。至少对我来说，在精神上，我更想关注的是行动或者发生的事情，而不是这个人本身。你明白我的意思吗？对。我不想评判这个人，也不想给他扣帽子、责备什么的。我更想谈谈我们之间发生的事情。所以我觉得匿名性让我感觉……
[00:32:59.310] like I'm not doing that. But you know, even if you name them, it's like you're still just talking about the actions or like the stories that happen between you. Like it's not like you're like talking shit with someone. It's like your therapist. Yeah, that's true. Now next thing you know, she's walking down the street, grabbing her coffee. She hears a name and she's like, oh my god, that's Jisoo's whoever, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's so funny.
[00:32:59.310] 好像我没那样做似的。但你知道，就算你说出他们的名字，感觉你还是在谈论你们之间发生的那些事或者故事。感觉不像是在跟人胡说八道，更像是在跟你的心理咨询师聊天。对，没错。然后，你知道的，她走在街上，买了杯咖啡。她听到一个名字，然后就说，我的天哪，那是智秀的那个谁，你知道吗？对对对。哦，这太搞笑了。
[00:33:25.110] I think part of it too is I'm just like the type of person that would totally like look people up, even though I know therapists and like doctors, like they're not supposed to do that. But I just am that bitch. So she gets protection from that. Now I'm imagining we show up to our sessions with a fucking giant whiteboard and like pictures of the people in our lives, like magnetized to the board
[00:33:25.110] 我觉得部分原因也是因为我就是那种会忍不住去查别人隐私的人，虽然我知道心理咨询师和医生不应该这么做。但我就是这么个爱刨根问底的人。所以她才能免受这种困扰。现在我脑补了一下，我们每次去咨询的时候都会带着一块巨大的白板，上面贴着我们生活中重要人物的照片，就像用磁铁吸附在白板上一样。
[00:33:50.750] with like red marker lines drawn everywhere and like notes written in the corner. Oh my god. We go in and we're like, all right, here is the deal today. Giving a lesson. Dude, I love that. That would probably make it so much more fun for the therapist too, honestly. Dude, yeah, we can make like slideshows. I'll be like, all right, so this person, age, location, how I've known them, what our current
[00:33:50.750] 到处都画满了红色记号笔的线条，角落里还写满了笔记。我的天哪。我们进去之后就说，好了，今天的内容是这样的：上一堂课。哥们儿，我喜欢这个主意。说实话，这对治疗师来说可能也更有趣。哥们儿，对啊，我们可以做幻灯片。我会说，好，这个人，年龄，所在地，我是怎么认识他的，我们目前的情况
[00:34:20.650] relationship is. Next slide, like the other person, person B, like blah, blah, blah, blah. The final slide is like how person A through F are connected with me. That's gold. But honestly, I feel like in the Bay, you just never know, especially if you have someone in your community or like someone who lives in a city that might be your hometown, things like that, you just never know. Wait, that's so true.
[00:34:20.650] 关系就是这样。下一张幻灯片，就像另一个人，B，等等等等。最后一张幻灯片展示了A到F这些人是如何与我联系的。这真是绝了。但说实话，我觉得在湾区，你永远无法预料，尤其是在你的社区里，或者像住在你家乡那样的城市里的人，诸如此类，你永远无法预料。等等，这说得太对了。
[00:34:46.390] It's dangerous in the Bay. It's like normally what it's six degrees of separation, but I swear in the Bay, it's like three. Have you ever done remote therapy, by the way? The only time I did remote therapy was my intro call with my current therapist. So that was like really my only experience. I've had a couple of times where I was like, oh shit, like schedule wise, I feel like remote might make more
[00:34:46.390] 湾区很危险。通常来说，人与人之间是六度分隔理论，但在湾区，我发誓，感觉三度分隔就够了。对了，你做过远程治疗吗？我只做过一次远程治疗，就是和我现在的治疗师的初次咨询。所以那算是我唯一的远程治疗经验。有好几次，我都觉得，哎呀，从时间安排上来说，远程治疗可能更省事。
[00:35:12.450] sense. But there's just something about the magic of like in-person therapy that I like, that makes me not want to do remote. But why do you ask? I just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on like the difference. Oh. Anything you noticed or anything you feel? I think the only thing that I noticed was it felt very work meeting-y. And I also don't love phone calls and like calling in general.
[00:35:12.450] 确实如此。但我就是喜欢面对面治疗那种独特的魔力，所以不想做远程治疗。你为什么这么问？我只是想知道你对远程治疗和工作治疗的区别有什么看法。哦。你注意到什么或者有什么感受吗？我觉得我唯一注意到的就是远程治疗感觉很像工作会议。而且我也不喜欢打电话，总的来说我不喜欢打电话。
[00:35:41.010] Yeah. It's not my favorite form of communication, I would say. So then I could feel myself being, you know, like hyper focusing on the clock because it's easy to like look at it on the corner of your computer screen and stuff like that. Literally after that one remote session, I was like, okay, I'm not, I'm like not fit to be like a remote client for therapy. Yeah. I think it's pretty interesting. Like my in-person sessions, my therapist is really intentional about the space,
[00:35:41.010] 是的。说实话，这不是我最喜欢的沟通方式。所以，我感觉自己会特别关注时间，因为很容易就会忍不住去看电脑屏幕角落里的时间之类的。真的，在那次远程咨询之后，我就觉得，好吧，我可能不适合做远程咨询的客户。嗯，我觉得这挺有意思的。就像我的面对面咨询一样，我的治疗师会非常注重营造氛围，
[00:36:09.950] her office, I guess. There's always like an air purifier running. There's always like water ready for you if you need any. It's like a very curated space, I guess, you know, it's like purposely made for you to feel comfortable and hopefully relaxed. But then I feel like in remote sessions, depending on where you are, at least in my case, I feel like I've always had slight anxiety. Like, oh my God,
[00:36:09.950] 我猜是她的办公室。那里总是开着空气净化器，也总是备着水，以防你需要。感觉像是一个精心布置的空间，你知道，像是特意为你打造的，让你感到舒适放松。但我觉得在远程咨询中，至少对我来说，无论你身处何地，我都会感到轻微的焦虑。就像，天哪，
[00:36:38.310] what if someone like walks in on me and I'm in the middle of my session? You know, like, because usually you're taking it in maybe your room or a phone booth. So there's always like a slight worry like, oh my God, what if someone like knocks on my door and is like trying to talk to me? What if someone walks by outside and like hears me sharing my, I don't know, some vulnerable sad story or,
[00:36:38.310] 如果有人突然闯进来，而我正在录音怎么办？你知道，因为通常录音的时候，你可能是在自己的房间里，或者电话亭里。所以总会有点担心，天哪，如果有人敲我的门，想跟我说话怎么办？如果有人路过，听到我分享一些脆弱悲伤的故事怎么办？
[00:37:02.950] you know. So I do think like in person, it's kind of nice that it's like, oh, this is like a very safe space. No one's going to walk in on us. It's like dedicated to therapy right now. So that's like a very positive thing that I've felt for myself. I like that. And I think similarly, I do feel that my therapist space is very curated and comfortable. And I think if you're someone who has difficulty having their guard up or like sharing about really personal things and stuff like that, I feel like
[00:37:02.950] 你知道。所以我觉得面对面咨询的感觉很好，就像，哦，这是一个非常安全的空间。不会有人闯进来。这里现在完全是专门用来做心理咨询的。所以，这是我个人感受到的非常积极的一点。我很喜欢。同样地，我觉得我的咨询室布置得很用心，很舒适。我觉得如果你是一个难以敞开心扉或者不太喜欢分享非常私人的事情的人，我觉得
[00:37:32.870] in person therapy is a lot better. And the reason I say that is if I'm at home, this is like my zone, like my territory, right? I'm like still in that same mindset of I'm in my house. But then when I'm in her place, it's like the reason that I'm like doing this therapy feels a little bit more real. And it feels like I'm going in with like a mission versus if I see it as like a video call or something, I might think like, okay, this is just a part of my schedule today. Like just do this video call
[00:37:32.870] 面对面治疗效果好得多。我这么说的原因是，如果我在家，那就像是我的地盘，我的领地，对吧？我仍然会保持那种“我在家”的心态。但当我在她那里的时候，我感觉我做治疗的目的更真实了。感觉就像我带着使命感去接受治疗，而如果我把它看作是视频通话之类的，我可能会想，好吧，这只是我今天日程安排的一部分。就像只是打个视频电话而已。
[00:38:02.710] and then I can do X, Y, Z afterwards. Right. So I feel like it's a little bit harder to like immerse yourself in the moment too, along with all the like potential distractions of just like, you know, not being in like their specific office that can sort of make remote therapy less appealing for me. Yeah, very true. And I think also in person, you can see more of the full body language,
[00:38:02.710] 然后我之后可以做X、Y、Z。对。所以我觉得很难完全沉浸其中，再加上各种潜在的干扰，比如不在他们特定的办公室里，这些都让远程治疗对我来说吸引力降低了。是的，确实如此。而且我觉得面对面的时候，你能看到更完整的肢体语言。
[00:38:26.050] which I don't know, hopefully is helpful for the therapist. That's true. There's two awkward things I think about in person though. So one of them was just a very specific happening. I got to therapy and then I always sit on the couch in the room that she has set up right in front of the couch is like a water carafe and some water cups. So one time I sat down and she was like, would you like
[00:38:26.050] 我不知道，希望这对治疗师有帮助。确实如此。不过，有两件事我当面想起来会觉得尴尬。其中一件是件很具体的事。我去接受治疗，她会在房间里的沙发上布置一些东西，比如水壶和几个水杯。有一次我坐下后，她问我：“你想喝点什么吗？”
[00:38:52.230] some water? And I was like, I'm good. I just felt so like, I felt so like rude and like awkward, but I was like, no, it's fine. I'm good. But it ended up coming out just like, I'm good. Like, you know, that's so funny. And I was like, she's like, okay. I was like, oh God. Like so embarrassed internally for like a good five minutes. And then I also think ending sessions is so awkward.
[00:38:52.230] 要不要喝点水？然后我就说，我没事。我当时感觉特别失礼，特别尴尬，但我还是说，不，没事，我没事。结果最后脱口而出的就是“我没事”。你知道吗，这太搞笑了。然后她说，好的。我当时就想，我的天哪。内心尴尬了足足五分钟。而且我觉得结束咨询的时候也很尴尬。
[00:39:22.870] Oh, in person? Yeah. The actual ending itself is fine because my therapist will just be like, okay, well, like, you know, time's up. We'll talk more next week. And we talk briefly about like when we're meeting next. But then I have to like walk to the door to leave. And she like walks me to the door and it's like so awkward. Wait, but that's like how I leave sessions too. Like after we wrap up,
[00:39:22.870] 哦，是当面吗？对。其实结束的时候还好，因为我的治疗师会说，好了，时间到了。我们下周再聊。然后我们会简单地聊聊下次见面的时间。但之后我就得自己走到门口离开。她会送我到门口，感觉好尴尬。等等，但我每次咨询结束的时候也是这样。就像我们结束咨询之后，
[00:39:49.650] she like walks me to the door, but you guys don't do like small talk or anything like to the door? Yeah. Well, okay. To be honest, it's like five steps. Oh, I see. I see. So it's like not enough time to small talk, but like still long enough to feel the silence. Yes. Because we'll be like, okay. And then we'll say bye. And then we'll get up and she walks me to the door. And then we say bye like two more times on the way to the door. And then again,
[00:39:49.650] 她会送我到门口，但你们在门口都不闲聊什么的吗？嗯。好吧。说实话，也就五步路。哦，我明白了。我明白了。所以时间不够闲聊，但又足够感受到那份沉默。是的。因为我们会说，好吧。然后我们会说再见。然后我们会起身，她送我到门口。然后我们在到门口的路上又说了两遍再见。然后，
[00:40:17.270] and I'm like, dude, I don't know how to make leaving therapy less awkward. It's just it's so awkward in my mind. I'm like, fuck, dude. Why am I so awkward? Wait, that is so funny. I mean, I would consider myself pretty up there on the list of like awkwardness. But how we always end our sessions is like, she's like, okay, so I think we're pretty much at time. And this after like 30
[00:40:17.270] 然后我就想，老兄，我不知道怎么才能让结束治疗不那么尴尬。我就是觉得很尴尬。我就想，妈的，老兄。我怎么这么尴尬？等等，这太搞笑了。我的意思是，我觉得自己在尴尬排行榜上应该名列前茅。但我们每次结束治疗的方式都是，她会说，好了，我觉得我们差不多到时间了。这可是30次治疗之后的事了。
[00:40:45.690] seconds of like nodding from both of us, you know, because we're both like, okay, it's probably time, but like someone needs to say it. So she says that and then she's like, when do you want to meet next? And there's like some sort of recurring schedule, but we just double check anyway. Right. Sometimes she'll be like, oh, I can't do this date because blah, blah, blah. And then I'll be like, oh, like, where are you going? And then that would be our small talk topic to the door. And she'll be like, oh, I'm doing this, blah, blah, blah. And then it always ends with like, have a nice weekend. So you're like getting up while you're talking about your next
[00:40:45.690] 我们俩都点头了几秒钟，你知道，因为我们都觉得，好吧，可能是时候了，但总得有人说出来。所以她说了，然后问，下次想什么时候见面？我们好像有个固定的约会安排，但还是会再确认一下。对。有时候她会说，哦，这次约会不行，因为……等等等等。然后我会问，哦，那你要去哪儿？然后这就是我们到门口的闲聊话题。她会说，哦，我要去这个……等等等等。最后总是以一句“祝你周末愉快”结束。所以你一边起身一边说着下次约会的事。
[00:41:15.510] appointment. We double check the next appointment. Like, oh, it looks like our next session is this. And then I'll be like, oh yeah, perfect. That works. And then we both get up and then either one of us would be like, oh, what are you doing that weekend that we're skipping? Or like, you know, if there's a holiday, like, what are you doing this holiday weekend? Okay. And then a half sentence share. It's like, have fun, have nice weekend. And that's like the five steps to the door. You know what I mean? Okay. Maybe I'll give that a try next time.
[00:41:15.510] 预约。我们会再次确认下次的预约时间。比如，哦，看起来我们下次的预约是这个时间。然后我会说，哦，太好了，没问题。然后我们俩都会起身，然后我们其中一人会问，哦，我们取消的那个周末你有什么安排？或者，你知道，如果有个假期，就会问，你这个假期周末有什么安排？好的。然后简单说几句。比如，玩得开心，周末愉快。这就像是通往成功之门的五个步骤。你明白我的意思吗？好的。下次我也许会试试。
[00:41:42.090] Okay. But I always feel like it's, it's like a violation if I ask her like about her life. Like, I shouldn't ask her about her personal life. So I'm just like, okay, we get up, we start walking and I'm like, okay, uh, bye. And she's like, all right, like have a good week.
[00:41:42.090] 好吧。但我总觉得，如果我问她关于她生活的事情，就好像是一种冒犯。好像我不应该问她的私事。所以我就说，好吧，我们起身，开始散步，然后我说，好吧，呃，再见。她就会说，好的，祝你一周愉快。
[00:42:04.250] And I'm like, okay, you too. But I like open the door. I like, it's so awkward that I don't even take the last step to the door. I just lean forward and reach for the door. And I open it. You like long jump out of the door. And then I open the door and I like immediately scooch out.
[00:42:04.250] 然后我就想，好吧，你也一样。但我喜欢开门。我觉得，这太尴尬了，我甚至都迈不出最后一步。我只是向前倾身，伸手去够门把手。然后我打开门。你就像跳出门外一样。然后我打开门，立刻就溜出去了。
[00:42:24.030] And I'm like, okay, bye. Oh my God. That is so funny. Holy fuck. Yeah. It's a real problem. Dude, that is just hilarious. Okay. I'll try the small talk thing next time. Yeah. Maybe I can ask her. I'll be like, oh, so like, what were you doing in July when we couldn't have sessions?
[00:42:24.030] 然后我就想，好吧，拜拜。我的天哪。这也太搞笑了。卧槽。是啊。这确实是个问题。老兄，这简直太逗了。好吧。下次我试试闲聊。嗯。也许我可以问问她。我会说，哦，对了，七月份我们不能见面的时候你在干嘛？
[00:42:51.390] Wait, that sounds weird. That sounds weird. That's like, oh, why are we so busy? You couldn't even see me. Oh God. It's just getting worse and worse. You know what would also be awkward? You know, when you part with like a friend and you're like, oh my God, like this lunch day was so fun. Like hope to see you next time. Like, can you imagine doing that with your therapist? Like, oh, this session was so insightful. Like, can't wait to see you next time.
[00:42:51.390] 等等，这听起来好奇怪。这听起来好奇怪。就好像，哦，我们怎么这么忙？你都没空理我。天哪。情况越来越糟了。你知道还有什么会很尴尬吗？你知道，就像你和朋友告别时，你会说，哦，我的天，今天的午餐太开心了。希望下次还能见到你。你能想象和你的心理咨询师这样说吗？就像，哦，这次咨询太有启发性了。迫不及待想下次再见你。
[00:43:19.020] You're just like rating like the session. Okay. Yeah. Oh my dude. I'm just like thinking about all my exits right now. Sometimes I'll be like, oh yeah. Like, thanks. Bye. See you next time. Holy shit. Why is it so bad? Oh my God. It's okay. You're only like five sessions in, you know, like you're right. You're not homies like that yet. Yeah. You're right. Sometimes I also
[00:43:19.020] 你就像是在给这次会话打分。好吧。是啊。我的天哪。我现在满脑子想的都是怎么退出。有时候我会想，哦，对。比如，谢谢。拜拜。下次见。我的天哪。为什么这么糟糕？我的天哪。没关系。你才参加了五次会话，你知道，就像你说的，你们还没到那种程度。是啊。你说得对。有时候我也会
[00:43:46.300] like, as we're walking to the door, I'm like, oh my God, I don't know if I should like look at her. She like kind of walks behind me a bit and I'm like, and then I like almost like, I like twitch. I'm like, look, double take to look at her or something. And when I open the door, I like turn around. I'm like, okay, bye. Actually, to be fair, I don't think I really look at my therapist when I'm
[00:43:46.300] 就像，我们走向门口的时候，我突然想，天哪，我不知道该不该看她。她走到我身后，我就……然后我几乎……感觉自己有点儿神经质。我感觉自己好像在偷偷地回头看了她一眼。然后我打开门，转过身，说，好了，拜拜。其实说实话，我觉得我跟我的心理咨询师在一起的时候，我其实不太会去看她。
[00:44:12.260] walking out. Okay. I'm just like, okay, time's up. Like I need to get the fuck out of here. So I just like stride to the door, mini small talk and then turn to say bye and that's it. Okay. All right. Okay. So it's not all bad. Yeah. Yeah. There's a method to the badness. Yeah. I just need to make some minor changes. I'm so sorry. You had to hear how awkwardly terrible my goodbyes are.
[00:44:12.260] 走出去。好吧。我就想，好吧，时间到了。我得赶紧离开这儿。所以我就大步走到门口，简单寒暄几句，然后转身说再见，就结束了。好吧。行了。好吧。所以也没那么糟糕。是啊。是啊。糟糕也是有原因的。是啊。我只需要做一些小小的改变。真抱歉。你不得不听我那尴尬又糟糕的告别。
[00:44:42.520] No, it, it takes some getting accustomed to, to like develop a rhythm. I think I totally get it. This is like my question when I was like, how do you say hi to someone on a first date? It's like, how do you say bye to your therapist? Dude. Cause also for remote sessions, you're just like, okay, bye. Close the tab. You're like, oh, true. Yeah. True. True. True. See you next time. Yeah. Close tab and you're good. There's no physical movements you need to do. There's no awkward walking. They don't need to see me get out of my seat.
[00:44:42.520] 不，这需要一段时间适应，就像要培养一种节奏。我觉得我完全明白了。这就像我之前问的，第一次约会该怎么打招呼？就像跟你的心理咨询师说再见一样。因为远程咨询的话，你只需要说，好的，再见。关掉网页。你会想，哦，对。是啊。对。对。对。下次见。嗯。关掉网页就搞定了。不需要任何肢体动作。不用尴尬地走来走去。他们不需要看到我从座位上站起来。
[00:45:12.720] I will say though, I feel like I feel the opposite sentiment as you where sometimes I feel bad that I don't make that much small talk with my therapist. I'm like, damn, she always asks me how I'm doing, but I never ask her how she's doing. Oh my God. It's like those memes. Yeah. I know what you mean though. I guess I haven't felt that quite yet, but maybe as I get closer to my therapist, I'll have those feelings. But yeah, no, for some reason
[00:45:12.720] 不过，我得说，我感觉自己和你正好相反，有时候我会因为和我的心理咨询师很少闲聊而感到内疚。我就想，哎，她总是问我过得怎么样，但我从来没问过她过得怎么样。天哪。就像那些梗图一样。是啊。我明白你的意思。我想我还没完全体会到那种感觉，但也许随着我和咨询师的关系越来越亲密，我也会有这种感觉。不过，嗯，不知道为什么，目前还没有这种感觉。
[00:45:37.680] right now, my thoughts are just like, wow, wouldn't it be like a violation if I'm asking her about her personal life? I'm like, who am I for her to share her personal life with? You know? I think I usually feel that way, but it's like when she does drop small details about her life in our sessions, I'm like, oh my God, I can't believe I've been going to you for two years and I didn't know this until now. Like that kind of feeling, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. And then I feel
[00:45:37.680] 我现在满脑子想的都是，哇，如果我问她关于她私生活的事，那岂不是侵犯了她的隐私？我就想，我凭什么让她跟我分享她的私事？你知道吗？我觉得我通常都是这种感觉，但当她在咨询过程中无意间透露一些她生活中的小细节时，我就会想，我的天哪，我竟然跟你咨询了两年，现在才知道这些。就是那种感觉，你明白我的意思吗？嗯，嗯。然后我就觉得
[00:46:02.240] the guilt of like, should I be asking you how your weekend is before we, before the like two seconds small talk to the door at the end? Dude. Speaking of like asking your therapist how their weekend was and stuff, how do you say hi to your therapist? Usually I'm just like, hi. And then I'm like, God, it's so hot outside. Or like there's so much traffic to, you know, like some really inane shit because I need like a filler sentence before I jump into all my traumas of the week.
[00:46:02.240] 那种内疚感，就像，在最后那两秒钟的寒暄之前，我该不该问问你周末过得怎么样？老兄。说到问问你的心理咨询师周末过得怎么样之类的，你该怎么跟你的咨询师打招呼呢？通常我就说“嗨”。然后我就会说，天哪，外面好热啊。或者说，路上堵车堵得要死，你知道的，就是一些很无聊的废话，因为我需要一句过渡语，才能开始倾诉我这周的所有创伤。
[00:46:29.960] Right, right. But I also don't want to open up Pandora's box and have like a five minute small talk session at the beginning because that cuts into my, my like payment time, right? Yeah. Okay. So this is what happens to me. And you know, I'm, I'm not a big fan of small talk and I'm not good at small talk either. So I walk in and it's like, hi, hi. We like silently take our
[00:46:29.960] 对，对。但我也不想打开潘多拉魔盒，一开始就来个五分钟的闲聊，因为那样会占用我的付款时间，对吧？嗯。好的。所以，事情就是这样。你知道，我不太喜欢闲聊，也不擅长闲聊。所以我走进去，就说，嗨，嗨。然后我们就默默地……
[00:46:55.580] five steps to the couch and everything. I sit down. Why is there so much silence? I don't know. I'm so sorry. And then, you know, she's just down, she pulls out her notebook, she's getting, getting comfortable and stuff. And she's like, how's, how's your week? You know, how have you been? And I'm like, good. And then she'll be like, oh, okay, great. And then she'll be like, so what do you want to
[00:46:55.580] 走到沙发那儿也就五步路。我坐下。怎么这么安静？我不知道。真抱歉。然后，你知道，她就放松下来，拿出笔记本，让自己舒服些。她问我，你这周过得怎么样？你知道，你最近怎么样？我说，挺好的。然后她会说，哦，好的，太好了。然后她会问，那你想要什么？
[00:47:24.480] talk about this week? And then I'm like, um, I don't know. Well, actually that's not true. I don't say, I don't know, but I'm just kind of like, um, uh, and if I don't say something right away, she'll be like, we can talk about like these things that we talked about last time or this thing that we didn't get to. And I'll be like, okay. And then we'd like start to jump into conversation, but our hellos are also awkward, but I want, I do want to say our buys are the most awkward.
[00:47:24.480] 聊聊这周的事？然后我就说，嗯，我不知道。其实也不是真的不知道。我不会直接说“我不知道”，但我就是支支吾吾的，嗯，呃……如果我不马上说点什么，她就会说，我们可以聊聊上次聊过的那些事，或者上次没聊到的事。然后我就说，好的。然后我们就开始聊天了，不过我们打招呼的时候也很尴尬，但我想说，我们买东西的时候最尴尬。
[00:47:50.040] Oh my God. This kills me. I bet there's so many, like, I want to like shower you with suggestions right now. You get literally like, oh, that's a nice notebook. And then that's like three or two of the five seconds. You know what I mean? I see. That is so funny though. I guess I need to work on, maybe I should talk to my therapist about my encounters with her. Would you name it though?
[00:47:50.040] 我的天哪。这简直要了我的命。我敢肯定有很多，我现在真想给你推荐一大堆东西。你听到的可能就是，“哦，这个笔记本真不错。”然后，五秒钟里也就两三秒钟是这样。你懂我的意思吗？我明白了。不过这真的太搞笑了。我想我需要好好想想，也许我应该跟我的心理咨询师聊聊我跟她遇到的事。你能告诉我她是谁吗？
[00:48:19.340] Like, oh my God, I want to talk to you about how awkward I feel around you. Or would you be like, I have this friend? I'd probably be like, oh my God, I'm so awkward. I'm so sorry. Why do you think I'm so awkward? Why do you think our buys are so awkward? Do you, do you need me to give you some small talk? Because I can, I can try. Your therapist is going to be like, oh my God,
[00:48:19.340] 比如，天哪，我想跟你聊聊我跟你在一起有多尴尬。或者你会说，我有个朋友？我可能会说，天哪，我好尴尬。真抱歉。你觉得我为什么这么尴尬？你觉得我们之间的互动为什么这么尴尬？你需要我跟你闲聊几句吗？因为我可以，我可以试试。你的心理咨询师可能会说，天哪，
[00:48:47.960] I need to call my therapist. She'll be like, do you want to have a two person session with me with my therapist? It's couples therapy. Oh my God. That is so funny. One session though, and then we'll probably be right as rain. We won't have any more awkward goodbyes. That's true. And maybe this is also like just part of the process of getting to know your therapist
[00:48:47.960] 我得给我的心理咨询师打电话。她可能会问，你想不想和我的咨询师一起做个双人咨询？这是夫妻咨询。我的天哪。这也太搞笑了。不过，一次咨询之后，我们可能就一切都好起来了。以后也不会再有尴尬的告别了。确实如此。也许这也是了解你的咨询师的过程的一部分吧。
[00:49:16.390] because people also approach small talk differently. So yeah, maybe do that couples therapy with your therapist. Let us know how it goes. Okay. And hopefully your therapist is able to graduate to crystal 101, 102 and the upper division classes for all the juicy details of your life. Hopefully soon. I always find it really interesting talking about therapy with you though, because I feel like we have different approaches to therapy and also kind of different relationships
[00:49:16.390] 因为每个人处理闲聊的方式都不一样。所以，或许你可以和你的治疗师一起去做个伴侣治疗。记得告诉我们进展如何。好的。希望你的治疗师能尽快“毕业”，开始学习水晶疗法101、102以及更高阶的课程，了解你生活中所有精彩的细节。希望这一天早日到来。不过，我总是觉得和你聊治疗很有意思，因为我觉得我们对治疗的理解方式不同，我们对治疗的理解也略有不同。
[00:49:46.030] with our various therapists. So hopefully this was also interesting for our listeners to hear about the different ways that your relationships with your therapists can go.
