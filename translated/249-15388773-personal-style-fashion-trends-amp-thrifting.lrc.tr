[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Aileen. Welcome back, Aileen. The last episode Aileen was on with us was episode 182, the evolution of the parent permission. Dang, it's been a while. We're almost at 250 now. Wow, thanks for having me.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Aileen。欢迎回来，Aileen。Aileen上次做客是第182期，主题是家长许可的演变。哎呀，好久不见了。我们马上就要到250期了。哇，谢谢邀请。
[00:00:34.080] But we brought Aileen on because we thought it would be fun to talk about personal style in our modern world of extremely fast-paced trends and lots of like fast fashion. And I feel like this is something that you're really interested in, fashion in general and curating your personal
[00:00:34.080] 我们邀请艾琳是因为我们觉得，在如今这个快节奏的潮流和快时尚盛行的时代，聊聊个人风格会很有意思。而且我觉得你对时尚，尤其是如何打造个人风格，真的很感兴趣。
[00:00:52.560] style. So we thought you would be the perfect guest to join us today. Yay, thanks. I'm really excited about this topic, actually. Dude, I love talking to fashionable people because I try, you know, like mentally, I try to keep up with what is going on in the world,
[00:00:52.560] 时尚。所以我们觉得您是今天最合适的嘉宾。耶，谢谢。其实我对这个话题真的很兴奋。老兄，我喜欢和时尚人士聊天，因为你知道，我努力让自己在精神上跟上世界潮流。
[00:01:08.560] what looks are trending and you know, what the latest hot new look is. But I feel like in terms of incorporating it into my closet, I just can't seem to keep up my purchases with like the latest
[00:01:08.560] 你知道，现在流行什么款式，最新的流行趋势是什么。但我觉得，要把这些潮流融入到我的衣橱里，我好像总是跟不上最新的购买速度。
[00:01:21.360] trends. I always feel like I'm six months behind where I see something on Instagram and I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool. And then it takes me like six months to convince myself to buy it.
[00:01:21.360] 潮流方面，我总是感觉自己慢了六个月。我在Instagram上看到什么东西，会觉得“哦，这个还挺酷的”，然后又要花六个月才能说服自己买下来。
[00:01:30.800] And then when I buy it, it's like all of the things in that style are on clearance already, you know, like it's like over. And I'm always like, oh, like how do other people manage to
[00:01:30.800] 然后当我买的时候，发现所有同款都已经打折了，你知道吗，感觉都卖光了。我总是想，哎，别人是怎么做到的？
[00:01:39.440] keep up with what's the latest and greatest? I mean, I wouldn't say that I'm always keeping up immediately with every trend or hopping on every trend bandwagon. And I guess we'll talk about it on. But I definitely think there's a balance between choosing what you genuinely like and
[00:01:39.440] 了解最新最潮的东西？我的意思是，我不会说我总是第一时间关注每一个潮流，或者盲目追随每一个潮流。我想我们以后还会讨论这个问题。但我确实认为，选择自己真正喜欢的东西和追逐潮流之间应该保持平衡。
[00:01:56.800] following and like keeping up with some trends, but also just leaving some behind and saying that's not for me. Yeah, I feel like it's pretty hard to kind of like what Jesus said, keep up,
[00:01:56.800] 我会关注并追随一些潮流，但也会放弃一些，说那不适合我。是的，我觉得很难做到像耶稣说的那样，坚持下去。
[00:02:07.600] because all this stuff is getting thrown at you. And then you're like, oh, shoot, what would fit me? And then maybe it's like by the time you're like, oh, let me try on this new trendy thing. It's
[00:02:07.600] 因为各种各样的东西都涌向你。然后你会想，哎呀，什么才适合我呢？然后也许等你意识到，哦，让我试试这个新潮的东西的时候，就已经……
[00:02:17.200] already four trends ahead. And you're like, wait, hold on. What's happening? Who am I? What am I? I guess the hardest part is maybe like owning it and maybe rejecting trends in itself is a whole
[00:02:17.200] 已经领先四大趋势了。你会想，等等，等等。发生了什么？我是谁？我到底是什么？我想最难的部分或许在于接受它，或许拒绝潮流本身就是一件难事。
[00:02:30.320] style. Yeah, I can see that. But some people even say that developing your personal style can be anti trendy going against some trends. And that is your personal style and not following a trend.
[00:02:30.320] 风格。嗯，我明白。但有些人甚至认为，发展个人风格本身就是一种反潮流的行为，与某些潮流背道而驰。而这才是你的个人风格，而不是盲目追随潮流。
[00:02:43.360] I think it ultimately comes down to what you personally like and what you feel comfortable in how that will define your personal style. That's a really interesting point, because sometimes I think about having like aspirational aesthetics. For example, recently, new jeans has been blowing
[00:02:43.360] 我认为最终还是要看你个人喜欢什么，以及你觉得怎样才能自在地展现你的个人风格。这一点很有意思，因为有时候我会想，是不是应该追求某种理想化的审美。比如，最近新款牛仔裤就非常流行。
[00:03:00.000] up and I feel like they're very known for their like vintage retro Y2K kind of look. And I'm like that is so fucking cute. And they work it so well. But I've just gone through so many trial and error
[00:03:00.000] 我觉得他们家很出名，就是那种复古的Y2K风格。我觉得这也太可爱了吧。而且他们驾驭得特别好。但我之前也经历了很多次的尝试和失败。
[00:03:11.600] things in the past where I'm like, oh my god, this look is so cute. I'm gonna like take the plunge and buy it. And once I buy it, it just rots in my closet because I'm like, I don't know if this is
[00:03:11.600] 过去我经常会遇到这种情况：看到一件衣服，觉得“天哪，这件衣服太可爱了！我要赶紧下手买下来！”结果买回来之后，它就一直躺在衣柜里吃灰，因为我会想：“我不知道这件衣服到底合不合适。”
[00:03:22.480] me. It's one thing to think like, I can't pull it off. But the other side too is like, I wouldn't feel like myself in this clothing item. So then why like bother wearing it? So I think what you
[00:03:22.480] 我。一方面，我会想“我驾驭不了这件衣服”。但另一方面，我又会想“穿上这件衣服我会感觉不像自己”。既然如此，为什么还要穿呢？所以我觉得你
[00:03:33.360] said about curating your personal style does require you to in some ways deviate from what's trendy, because not everything that looks good on other people looks good on you or makes you
[00:03:33.360] 打造个人风格确实需要你在某些方面偏离潮流，因为并非所有适合别人的东西都适合你，或者让你看起来很棒。
[00:03:44.400] feel comfortable in it too. Sometimes when I see some of those retro styles, or even I know like rich girl aesthetic was really popping up pretty recently. It's not trying to like copy and paste
[00:03:44.400] 我也觉得很舒服。有时候我看到一些复古风格，或者我知道最近很流行的那种富家女风格，感觉都挺不错的。这并不是简单的复制粘贴。
[00:03:56.640] the exact product or outfit, but it's more about identifying what about it do you like? So for example, the rich girl aesthetic, I think it's more about like clean lines, minimalist style, certain colors, like the color palette that I'm really drawn to. I try to identify what those
[00:03:56.640] 不是具体要找哪件产品或哪套衣服，而是要找出你喜欢它的哪些方面？比如，富家女的审美，我觉得更多的是简洁的线条、极简的风格、特定的颜色，比如我特别喜欢的那几种色调。我会试着去找出这些。
[00:04:14.320] pieces are, and then look at like when I go shopping, try to emulate some of those identifiers, I guess, in the pieces that I choose, and be really, really picky about the pieces that I choose.
[00:04:14.320] 我会挑选一些单品，然后看看它们的特点，比如我去购物的时候，我会尽量模仿这些特点，挑选一些符合这些特点的单品，而且我会非常非常挑剔地选择单品。
[00:04:25.920] So that's kind of how I draw inspiration from trends other than try to copy and paste it exactly for what it is. Well, I guess I never even thought about that. To be fair, I'm not like super into
[00:04:25.920] 所以，这就是我从潮流中汲取灵感的方式，而不是简单地照搬复制。嗯，我之前好像从来没想过这一点。说实话，我其实对潮流并没有特别狂热。
[00:04:35.600] fashion. So in my mind, I'm just like, okay, I guess this seems comfy. Or maybe it's like, I'll see someone dressed a certain way. And I'm like, Oh, I kind of like that style. But to me,
[00:04:35.600] 时尚。所以在我看来，我就会想，好吧，这看起来挺舒服的。或者可能是，我会看到有人穿某种衣服。然后我会想，哦，我挺喜欢这种风格的。但对我来说，
[00:04:46.400] it's almost more of like the vibe versus like the actual intricate details of like, you know, the lines, the color palette, that kind of stuff. I mean, I think that is your personal style.
[00:04:46.400] 这更多的是一种氛围，而不是像线条、配色之类的具体细节。我的意思是，我认为这才是你的个人风格。
[00:04:57.200] Like if you had a few words to identify your style, it seems like it's comfy, probably minimalist, probably a certain neutral colors that you like. I think sometimes I envision someone's personal style as like, you know, cartoon characters always wear like one outfit. Like
[00:04:57.200] 如果要用几个词来形容你的风格，感觉应该是舒适、简约，可能还会喜欢一些中性色。我有时候会把一个人的个人风格想象成，你知道，就像卡通人物总是穿同一套衣服一样。
[00:05:14.160] to me, that's like the embodiment of someone's personal style. It's like if I were to picture this person as a cartoon character, what would they be wearing? Interesting. So if you had to choose your like, you know, iconic cartoon character outfit, what do you think it would be?
[00:05:14.160] 对我来说，这就像是个人风格的体现。就好像如果我把这个人想象成一个卡通人物，他会穿什么呢？很有意思。所以，如果你要选择一套你心目中最具代表性的卡通人物服装，你觉得会是什么样的呢？
[00:05:31.760] My character would have a lot of accessories. I think that's like vintage bag, maybe some cool shoes, maybe a hat or something. But a pretty like a bucket hat. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do like bucket
[00:05:31.760] 我的角色会有很多配饰。我觉得比如复古包包，可能还有很酷的鞋子，帽子什么的。不过，我最喜欢的是渔夫帽。哦，对。我确实很喜欢渔夫帽。
[00:05:46.480] hats and earrings like jewelry. Yeah, so maybe maybe a character that's top to bottom dressed up. And it's not just like the outfit, like the clothing pieces, but it's the accessories and the secondary stuff. What about you both? Honestly, mine would be pretty simple,
[00:05:46.480] 帽子和耳环之类的首饰。嗯，所以也许可以塑造一个从头到脚都精心打扮的角色。不仅仅是服装，也包括配饰和其他小物件。你们俩呢？说实话，我的想法很简单。
[00:06:05.280] probably just like black pants, white t shirt and like white shoes. I see that. I always picture you in like your reddish plumish like v neck that you used to
[00:06:05.280] 可能就穿黑色裤子、白色T恤和白色鞋子吧。我明白。我总是想象你穿着你以前常穿的那种红紫色V领衫。
[00:06:18.640] wear a lot. And I think now that I'm talking about it out loud, maybe it's because that's what your Venmo photo is. Oh, okay. I was like, I don't think I've owned a shirt like that for a really
[00:06:18.640] 经常穿。现在我这么一说，我觉得可能是因为你的 Venmo 头像就是这件衬衫吧。哦，好吧。我当时想，我好像很久没穿过这样的衬衫了。
[00:06:31.360] long time. I know. I always picture Chris. Oh my gosh. So we've been sending money to each other a lot. She's got that like what is a visual memory? Let's see. I think mine would be fairly
[00:06:31.360] 很久了。我知道。我总是想起克里斯。我的天哪。所以我们一直互相寄钱。她有那种……嗯，什么是视觉记忆？让我想想。我觉得我的应该相当……
[00:06:47.440] simple. Probably just the white maxi skirt I've been wearing a ton this year. And then some sort of like gray short sleeve top and Birkenstocks probably because I can't seem to let those go. But which kinds of Birkenstocks? The Clogs? The classics? The Arizonas, the classics.
[00:06:47.440] 很简单。大概就是我今年穿了很多次的那条白色长裙。再配一件灰色短袖上衣和勃肯鞋，可能是因为我舍不得扔掉它们。但是哪种勃肯鞋呢？木屐款？经典款？亚利桑那款，经典款。
[00:07:06.640] She's a classic girly. Dude, actually, I feel like this exercise is really interesting because another like angle you could kind of think about this is if you were to try to get like artwork of
[00:07:06.640] 她是个典型的淑女。老兄，说真的，我觉得这个练习真的很有意思，因为你可以从另一个角度来思考这个问题，比如，如果你尝试创作一些艺术作品……
[00:07:20.000] yourself, what outfit would you want to be in? Now that we're talking about artwork, mine would be really colorful. I think for me, when I shop the things that I gravitate towards, because I go
[00:07:20.000] 如果让你选，你最想穿什么样的衣服？既然说到艺术作品，那我选的肯定是色彩鲜艳的。我觉得对我来说，我购物的时候，总是会被一些我喜欢的东西吸引，因为我经常去……
[00:07:32.800] thrifting a lot, I could spend hours doing it, but I'm like really quick at it. Like I'm a very quick shopper because I always look at two things. It's fabric and color. And so if it were an art piece,
[00:07:32.800] 我经常逛二手店，可以花好几个小时，但我买东西很快。我购物速度很快，因为我只看两样东西：面料和颜色。所以，如果是一件艺术品，
[00:07:44.560] it'd be canvas or it would be like a thicker material, but then it would also be very colorful. But the colors would be very complementary with each other. That would probably be my ideal art
[00:07:44.560] 它可能是帆布，或者某种更厚的材料，而且色彩会非常丰富。这些颜色之间会非常和谐。那大概就是我理想中的艺术作品了。
[00:07:56.160] piece. I think that's a really interesting and good way to look at purchasing clothing actually, because we talked a little bit about micro trends and aesthetics that are trending, whether that's
[00:07:56.160] 我觉得这确实是一个很有趣也很好的看待服装购买方式，因为我们之前讨论过一些正在流行的微趋势和美学理念，无论是……
[00:08:09.520] Y2K, rich girl, et cetera. And I feel like so much of that focuses on maybe more so like the shape or like that certain look that each piece has. And when you're doing a lot of online shopping,
[00:08:09.520] Y2K、富家女等等。我觉得这些潮流大多更注重款式或者每件单品所具有的某种特定风格。当你经常网购的时候，
[00:08:22.240] which I feel like is a little bit more common now, it is kind of hard, right? Like not everyone goes to like the product details and looks at what the material is made of and what percent of cotton and
[00:08:22.240] 我觉得现在这种情况比较常见了，但其实挺难的，对吧？好像不是每个人都会去看产品详情，看看材质是什么，棉的含量是多少等等。
[00:08:31.840] et cetera, et cetera, versus things like that are probably so much easier to spot and just even like feel with your fingertips in person. So do you feel like your affinity towards like thrifting and stuff helps you stay away from purchasing fast fashion things online? I think thrifting
[00:08:31.840] 等等等等，相比之下，这些东西可能更容易辨认，甚至可以用指尖亲身感受。所以你觉得你对逛二手店之类的爱好是否帮助你避免在网上购买快时尚产品？我认为逛二手店
[00:08:49.600] has helped me identify things that I should avoid when shopping online. So I actually do look at fabric content breakdowns very intently. I'm a very intentional shopper, I would say. I feel like with thrifting since thrifting from high school, I bought pieces that didn't work out or would
[00:08:49.600] 这帮助我识别出网购时应该避免的商品。所以我现在会非常仔细地查看面料成分表。可以说，我是一个非常有目的性的购物者。我觉得自从高中开始逛二手店以来，我买过很多不合适的衣服，或者买来之后觉得不合适的衣服。
[00:09:10.320] break down pretty easily or would rip or pill or whatnot. So I feel like over time I've developed an understanding of what fabric or like what styles would last longer. So then when I go online,
[00:09:10.320] 很容易损坏，或者会撕裂、起球什么的。所以我觉得随着时间的推移，我已经逐渐了解哪些面料或款式更耐穿。所以当我上网时，
[00:09:22.880] I'm like, okay, from my past experience of that top or that piece, I know like not to not to fall into this trap and not buy this piece online just because it's cheaper or it's on sale. So I definitely
[00:09:22.880] 我心想，好吧，根据我过去购买那件上衣或那件衣服的经验，我知道不能掉进这个陷阱，不能仅仅因为网上买的便宜或者打折就买。所以我肯定不会买。
[00:09:34.720] think thrifting has taught me to develop that eye a lot more because it's a lot more affordable and accessible. You can try on different trends, you can try on different colors when you thrift because
[00:09:34.720] 我觉得逛二手店让我更能培养时尚眼光，因为它价格更实惠，也更容易买到。在二手店里，你可以尝试不同的潮流，尝试不同的颜色。
[00:09:45.600] it's so cheap and like not feel guilty about spending tons of money on something and then have to donate it or sell it. So I feel like thrifting has definitely helped me curate my closet
[00:09:45.600] 它价格很便宜，而且你不会因为花很多钱买东西而感到内疚，也不用担心买回来之后还要捐出去或者卖掉。所以我觉得逛二手店确实帮助我整理好了衣橱。
[00:09:56.880] and be a lot safer with my online purchases, I would say. Do you guys go thrifting? Not really. Oh really? Only with you. Oh I know Crystal does that. Why am I surprised?
[00:09:56.880] 我觉得这样网购会安全得多。你们会去逛二手店吗？不太会。真的吗？只有跟你一起去。哦，我知道Crystal会去。我为什么会感到惊讶呢？
[00:10:09.040] I've done it like a couple of times but I don't know. I always get like weird buyer's remorse after thrifting. Really? Yeah, like I'll like like it in store and then I'll come home and I'll be like
[00:10:09.040] 我买过几次二手店的东西，但我不知道为什么。每次买完东西我都会有点后悔。真的吗？是啊，就像我在店里觉得不错，然后回家之后就觉得……
[00:10:19.360] actually I don't like this and I don't know why specifically with thrifting. Maybe it's more so that with thrifting you can't really like return stuff versus not doing that. It is more common to
[00:10:19.360] 其实我不喜欢这样，也不知道为什么特别不喜欢在二手店购物。也许是因为在二手店购物很难退货，而不是像在其他地方那样可以退货。这种情况更常见于……
[00:10:30.000] be able to return but I just don't trust myself to pick things well when I thrift. You get home you're like oh shit I can't return this now I suddenly don't like it anymore. I guess the good
[00:10:30.000] 虽然可以退货，但我就是不相信自己能挑到好东西。回家后突然发现“糟了，现在没法退了，我又不喜欢了”。我觉得好东西就是这样。
[00:10:43.520] thing is that it's so cheap you may have like wasted you know a few dollars instead of buying something final sale online for a lot more and having it shipped and then not being able to like
[00:10:43.520] 问题是它太便宜了，你可能只是浪费了几美元，而不是花更多的钱在网上买一件最终特价商品，还要支付运费，然后可能就买不到了。
[00:10:55.200] return it and ship it back. But that's so interesting huh I would have thought the opposite like not getting as much buyer remorse from thrifting because it's so cheap. I guess on the
[00:10:55.200] 退货并寄回去。不过这真有意思，不是吗？我原本以为正好相反，因为二手货很便宜，所以不会那么后悔。我想……
[00:11:06.640] topic of thrifting being cheaper overall, I guess I never thought about this because like you said I don't really thrift but I always did wonder like oh thrifting feels more and more popular
[00:11:06.640] 关于二手店购物总体上更便宜这个话题，我之前从来没想过，因为就像你说的，我不太逛二手店，但我一直很好奇，感觉逛二手店越来越流行了。
[00:11:17.760] in recent times and once I started noticing it I was kind of wondering why and I guess that's like a really big aspect to it the one that you just mentioned how you know a lot of this stuff is
[00:11:17.760] 最近我开始注意到这一点，我就一直在想为什么会这样，我想这大概就是其中很重要的一个方面，就像你刚才提到的，你知道很多这类事情。
[00:11:30.000] previously used and loved but still has like a lot of life in them so they're typically a little cheaper and more affordable. Do you think there's any other aspect of it that affects its popularity?
[00:11:30.000] 这些二手商品虽然很新，但仍然很耐用，所以通常价格会便宜一些，更实惠。你认为还有哪些因素会影响它们的受欢迎程度？
[00:11:42.400] I definitely think it grew in popularity because a lot of influencers started doing it. I remember watching Jen Inn, like one of the OG YouTubers. She started off highlighting thrifting and
[00:11:42.400] 我觉得它之所以流行起来，肯定是因为很多网红都开始做这件事了。我记得看过Jen Inn的视频，她算是最早的YouTube博主之一。她一开始就是分享二手店淘货和购物心得的。
[00:11:58.000] like all her finds from thrifting so I think it really blew up in social media of just like what you could get when you go thrifting so I think that definitely contributed to it. I think there is
[00:11:58.000] 就像她从旧货店淘到的所有宝贝一样，我觉得这在社交媒体上真的火了，大家都知道去旧货店能淘到什么好东西，所以我觉得这肯定起了作用。我觉得有
[00:12:11.920] for me personally there's a thrill to thrifting. I like going in with an open mind and just spending hours at the thrift store discovering things and being like really excited about thrifting finds
[00:12:11.920] 对我个人而言，逛旧货店有一种令人兴奋的感觉。我喜欢抱着开放的心态走进去，花上几个小时在旧货店里探索各种东西，并为淘到的宝贝感到无比兴奋。
[00:12:24.800] so I think people just enjoy the act of thrifting and probably just the thrill of the hunt and that's probably what has helped it blow up in popularity. I also have two theories maybe
[00:12:24.800] 所以我认为人们只是享受逛旧货店的过程，可能也享受寻宝的刺激感，这大概就是它如此受欢迎的原因。我还有两个猜想。
[00:12:36.880] minor like too macro or something but I feel like one thing about thrifting is that it's very like recession core so when the economy is in flux or maybe just not doing so well or people
[00:12:36.880] 虽然这可能只是个小问题，但我觉得旧货交易的一大特点是它很像经济衰退的核心因素，所以当经济处于波动状态，或者经济形势不佳时，人们……
[00:12:49.920] are getting laid off or etc I feel like thrifting is a good way to cut costs while still maintaining like the quality that you might be looking for so that could be one thing and I feel like the other
[00:12:49.920] 如果有人被裁员之类的，我觉得逛二手店是既能省钱又能保持品质的好方法，所以这可能是一方面，我觉得另一方面……
[00:13:01.840] flip side or benefit to thrifting is it's like more eco-friendly right? It's eco-friendly and it's very like community oriented whereas something like fast fashion where you partake knowing that there's exploitation in the supply chain can feel like something that you don't necessarily want to
[00:13:01.840] 旧货购物的另一面或好处是它更环保，对吧？它既环保，又非常注重社区建设，而像快时尚这样，当你明知供应链中存在剥削现象却仍然购买时，可能会觉得你并不想继续购买。
[00:13:18.800] participate in yourself so then by going to thrift stores where you know it comes for the community you know other people have used it before and it's like more eco-friendly in a sense
[00:13:18.800] 参与其中，比如去二手商店，你知道这些东西来自社区，其他人以前用过，从某种意义上说也更环保。
[00:13:29.360] might draw a lot of like young people to it I think. It's definitely more sustainable there are so much clothing waste out there and there's so much clothing to go around right there is controversy
[00:13:29.360] 我觉得这可能会吸引很多年轻人。它肯定更环保，现在服装浪费太严重了，而且衣服也很多，所以这方面也存在争议。
[00:13:40.880] around resellers like buying thrifted clothing from goodwill and then reselling it for a higher price on depop so there is definitely that discussion around thrifting but in general I feel
[00:13:40.880] 关于二手服装转售，比如从 Goodwill 购买旧衣服，然后在 Depop 等平台上以更高的价格转售，这方面确实存在一些讨论，但总的来说，我觉得
[00:13:51.520] like there's so much clothing to go around and we want to you know reduce waste as much as possible so a great way to do that and you know try out new things for your personal style is thrifting.
[00:13:51.520] 衣服那么多，我们想尽可能减少浪费，所以逛二手店是一个很好的方法，既能减少浪费，又能尝试新的个人风格。
[00:14:03.200] I think it's like one of the most sustainable ways to partake in that. Dude do you think thrifting actually contributes to some of these other trends like Y2K or like you know more quote
[00:14:03.200] 我觉得这是参与其中最可持续的方式之一。哥们，你觉得逛二手店真的会推动像Y2K之类的其他一些潮流吗？或者你知道的，引用更多
[00:14:15.840] unquote vintage I don't know even like 80s or like retro styles to come back into fashion because people are like thrifting older clothes and then the trend just starts to like kind of move
[00:14:15.840] 我不知道所谓的“复古”，甚至像80年代或者其他复古风格，会不会因为人们在二手店淘旧衣服，然后这种潮流就开始慢慢流行起来。
[00:14:27.520] the needle moves a bit as more and more people are thrifting. Yeah probably I don't know if this is a right saying but I think they say that like trends cycle every 20 years something like that
[00:14:27.520] 随着越来越多的人开始逛二手店，潮流趋势也略有变化。嗯，可能吧。我不知道这种说法对不对，但我记得有人说过，潮流大概每20年循环一次之类的。
[00:14:39.760] I don't know if it's 10 or 20 but in general like trends are very cyclical. I've definitely seen what you're saying though with the cycle of trends I remember the first time I got like a pair of
[00:14:39.760] 我不知道是10年还是20年，但总的来说，潮流是非常周期性的。我确实明白你说的潮流周期，我记得我第一次买到一双……
[00:14:51.920] Converse it must have been junior high or high school and my parents took one look at the shoe and they're like hey what the heck this is like the shoe that was popular when we were kids and
[00:14:51.920] 那双匡威鞋应该是在初中或高中时穿的，我父母看了一眼就说：“嘿，这是什么鞋？这不就是我们小时候流行的那种鞋吗？”
[00:15:01.600] I was like wait what the fuck these existed when you were like what and they're like dude yeah like this style was super in I can't believe it's like in for you guys now you lame old kids.
[00:15:01.600] 我当时就想，等等，这些东西到底是什么鬼？你问，什么？然后他们说，兄弟，是啊，这种风格以前超级流行，我简直不敢相信现在你们这些老古董居然还喜欢它。
[00:15:13.120] That's cute I think my dad commented about my Converse too and said he played it he used to wear Converse when playing basketball oh wow in China. Dude can you imagine talking to our kids
[00:15:13.120] 真可爱，我觉得我爸也评论过我的匡威鞋，他说他以前在中国打篮球的时候也穿匡威。哇，在中国啊。哥们儿，你能想象跟我们的孩子说这些话吗？
[00:15:24.320] or something and we see them wearing those like Maison Margiela like the toe shoes yeah oh my god like people totally used to wear that when we were young. Oh my gosh that would be crazy I was gonna say
[00:15:24.320] 或者别的什么，我们看到他们穿着像 Maison Margiela 那种人字拖，我的天哪，我们年轻的时候人们真的都穿过那种鞋。我的天哪，那也太疯狂了吧，我正想说呢。
[00:15:38.560] another reason I think thrifting is popular is because some people argue that the quality of clothing was better back in the day I mean compared to fast fashion right so you can find a lot of OG
[00:15:38.560] 我认为二手服装流行另一个原因是，有些人认为以前的服装质量更好，我的意思是，和快时尚相比，对吧？所以你能找到很多经典老衣服。
[00:15:50.800] brands with like 100% cotton or 100% linen clothing versus now where you go to Zara you go to fast fashion stores it's like 50% cotton or like even less than that so I think a lot of people
[00:15:50.800] 以前一些品牌会生产100%纯棉或100%纯亚麻的服装，而现在像Zara这样的快时尚品牌，服装的棉含量可能只有50%，甚至更低。所以我认为很多人
[00:16:05.120] go to thrifting to find those quality pieces that will last a lifetime I think that makes sense it's like you get more bang for your buck just a couple months ago I bought this sweater from Abercrombie
[00:16:05.120] 去二手店淘那些能穿一辈子的优质单品，我觉得很有道理，这样更划算。几个月前，我从Abercrombie买了一件毛衣。
[00:16:15.360] and I was like oh my god it's like the cutest sweater ever and then I washed it once and it literally disintegrated it was pilling all over anywhere that had friction after one wash and
[00:16:15.360] 我当时就觉得，天哪，这件毛衣也太可爱了吧！结果我洗了一次，它就彻底毁了，凡是摩擦过的地方都起球了。
[00:16:26.800] you know I feel like it also makes me think more about what you said earlier Eileen about you buy the item and not necessarily like look at the other stuff because I'm very much like a brand
[00:16:26.800] 你知道吗，这让我更加想起你之前说的艾琳的话，就是买东西的时候不一定要先看看其他的东西，因为我非常喜欢品牌。
[00:16:37.920] person so I feel like in my head I have good quality brands and bad quality brands and expensive brands and like I sort it based on like the label or the name but even within brands
[00:16:37.920] 所以我觉得，在我的脑海里，我会把品牌分成优质品牌、劣质品牌和昂贵品牌，然后根据标签或名称进行分类，但即使在同一个品牌内部，我也会根据品牌名称进行分类。
[00:16:49.120] some brands like Abercrombie I feel like certain things are more higher quality than other things or I have a friend who's like oh I go to this brand for jeans but I like this brand for shirts
[00:16:49.120] 有些品牌，比如 Abercrombie，我觉得某些东西的质量比其他东西好。或者我有个朋友会说，哦，我喜欢买这个牌子的牛仔裤，但我喜欢买另一个牌子的衬衫。
[00:16:57.920] or whatever I think those distinctions can also help someone be a little bit more intentional with those things versus just hitting up like five stores and being like okay all of the items
[00:16:57.920] 或者说，我认为这些区别也能帮助人们更有目的地去做这些事情，而不是漫无目的地逛五家店，然后说“好吧，所有东西都买下来”。
[00:17:07.520] in these stores are safe yeah every time I go shopping I'm like can I thrift this or thrift something similar to this and if it's yes I'm like I'm not gonna get it at full price
[00:17:07.520] 这些店都很安全，是的，每次我去购物，我都会想我能不能淘到这个或者类似的二手货，如果可以的话，我就不会花全价买了。
[00:17:18.720] dang were we just like ungrateful for what we had back in the day when clothes were better quality and now we're chasing our youth by thrifting I mean it's like before our time
[00:17:18.720] 唉，我们以前真是不知感恩，那时候衣服质量更好，现在却只能靠淘二手货来追寻青春，感觉就像回到了过去。
[00:17:30.080] like clothes like yeah some things but I do also want to kind of talk about like this vintage style and like more um like older trends in relation to thrifting I feel like there's been kind of a big
[00:17:30.080] 比如衣服之类的，是的，有些东西，但我也想聊聊复古风格，以及更早期的潮流，尤其是在二手店淘货方面。我觉得现在这种趋势越来越明显了。
[00:17:43.120] wave of this like more nostalgic vibes like even in the so Jisoo you mentioned like new jeans earlier and I feel like they are so interesting because they're like the epitome of gen z but also they
[00:17:43.120] 这股潮流更像是怀旧风，就像你之前提到的Jisoo穿的新牛仔裤一样，我觉得它们很有意思，因为它们就像是Z世代的缩影，但同时它们……
[00:17:58.400] do a lot of these old school like nostalgic y2k styles it's very interesting that that's how it is there's a lot of big emphasis on like bringing back film cameras and like getting these like you
[00:17:58.400] 很多时候都流行这种老派的、怀旧的Y2K风格，这很有意思，现在很多人都非常重视胶片相机的复兴，就像你……
[00:18:11.600] know grainier videos for like you know the vibes the style versus now we have this technology that can give you like you know crystal clear stuff but people are finding a lot more joy in exploring
[00:18:11.600] 你知道，以前人们喜欢看颗粒感较强的视频，那种感觉和风格与现在的技术截然不同。现在我们有了可以拍出非常清晰的视频，但人们却从中获得了更多探索的乐趣。
[00:18:23.920] these more um basically vintage style things so what are your thoughts on these what is so enticing about the vintage style so I feel like it's a common thing or common phenomenon for people
[00:18:23.920] 这些更偏向复古风格的东西，你觉得怎么样？复古风格到底有什么吸引人的地方？我觉得这是一种很普遍的现象。
[00:18:38.880] to romanticize eras that they weren't necessarily born into so even if you're not a fan of vintage so even when we were young the tumblr era I felt like I was always romanticizing like the 90s grunge
[00:18:38.880] 他们会美化自己未必经历过的时代，所以即使你不喜欢复古风，即使在我们年轻的时候，比如 Tumblr 时代，我也感觉自己总是在美化 90 年代的 Grunge 风格。
[00:18:54.320] look or something you kind of flip back x number of decades and imagine like oh what if I was 20 years old like in that era I feel like that just kind of shifts out a little bit so and that could
[00:18:54.320] 你看，或者说，你想象一下回到几十年前，然后想象如果我20岁，生活在那个年代会是什么样子。我觉得那种感觉会有点不一样，所以……
[00:19:06.080] be one of the reasons why the early 2000s look is so in now because kids that might be growing up now were barely born at the cusp of Britney Spears and like that era you know it's true I know at
[00:19:06.080] 2000年代初期的风格现在如此流行，原因之一就是现在成长起来的孩子们出生时正值布兰妮·斯皮尔斯走红的时期，你知道，确实如此，我知道。
[00:19:19.200] least for myself vintage designer bags I have a collection myself and I've always been drawn to vintage designer bags than current day designer bags and I think for several reasons the price
[00:19:19.200] 至少对我个人而言，我收藏了很多复古设计师包，而且我一直都更喜欢复古设计师包而不是现在的设计师包，我认为原因有很多，比如价格。
[00:19:32.800] point is a lot cheaper to buy vintage than to buy new example like a Chanel bag can go for like $15,000 it's like way out of budget but you can get a vintage style for half or even a third of
[00:19:32.800] 关键是要买二手货比买新的便宜得多。比如，一个香奈儿包可能要15000美元，远远超出预算，但你可以用一半甚至三分之一的价格买到复古款。
[00:19:48.480] that price I think another reason beyond the price point is also like I was saying earlier the quality there was just a lot more emphasis on quality and craftsmanship before I have a bag
[00:19:48.480] 我觉得除了价格之外，另一个原因是，就像我之前说的，质量也很重要。在我拥有这款包之前，他们对质量和工艺的重视程度要高得多。
[00:20:00.960] that's older than me and it's still really in really great condition and it's awesome to think bag is older than me in age but it's still very functional and it's still almost in like
[00:20:00.960] 它比我的年纪还大，但保存得仍然非常好，想到一个比我年纪还大的包包还能正常使用，真是太棒了，它几乎还能用。
[00:20:14.560] pristine condition the fact that has stood the test of time just speaks to the craftsmanship and the quality of the material and I think the nostalgic factor like you were saying Crystal
[00:20:14.560] 它保存完好，经受住了时间的考验，这本身就足以说明其精湛的工艺和优质的材料，而且我认为，就像你刚才说的，它还带有一种怀旧的气息，Crystal。
[00:20:25.120] seeing some of these vintage styles of designer bags in my example are a lot more unique and rare okay that's not really nostalgic but it's like some of the vintage styles are a lot rare to find
[00:20:25.120] 比如我举的这些例子，这些复古款式的设计师包包就非常独特和稀有。好吧，这其实不算怀旧，但确实有些复古款式很难找到。
[00:20:40.800] and come across than some of the newer ones that you can just buy in store honestly I think that makes sense the factor of having a bit of uniqueness to it versus you know everyone
[00:20:40.800] 而且我发现，有些新款产品比那些你在商店里就能买到的新产品更有特色。说实话，我觉得这很合理，毕竟它有点独特性，而那些产品却千篇一律。
[00:20:51.680] out there might have like the exact same thing during this current trend or whatever but you get to pull something out and be like oh my god yeah this has so much history it's like been around
[00:20:51.680] 或许在当前的潮流中，其他人也会有完全一样的东西，但你可以拿出一些东西，然后惊叹：“我的天哪，这东西历史悠久，仿佛已经存在很久了。”
[00:21:01.680] for longer than you and I I guess maybe there's almost even an element of mystery to it if you know like oh it's been 20 to 30 years of existence what was the previous owner like what adventures
[00:21:01.680] 我想，它存在的时间比你我都要长，如果你知道它已经有20到30年的历史了，也许它甚至带有一丝神秘感，比如，之前的拥有者有过怎样的经历？
[00:21:14.800] has this bag or whatever item gone on and now it's like ended up in my hands and I get to like add to its story that's so true the bag probably has seen more things than I have you know the bag has
[00:21:14.800] 这个包或者其他什么东西经历了什么，现在它竟然到了我手里，让我有机会续写它的故事。确实如此，这个包可能比我经历过的事情还多。你知道吗？
[00:21:26.480] stories if only our bags could talk no I think that makes sense this is slightly a tangent but it kind of reminds me of when my parents first moved to Dallas and they were house hunting and my dad
[00:21:26.480] 如果我们的行李会说话，那该多好啊！不，我觉得这很合理。这有点跑题了，但这让我想起了我父母刚搬到达拉斯的时候，他们正在找房子，我爸爸
[00:21:38.960] had said something to me about house hunting where he said what he looks for is not just the house itself but he also looks at the neighborhood and how many tall trees there are in a neighborhood
[00:21:38.960] 他跟我说过一些关于找房子的事，他说他不仅看房子本身，还会看社区环境，比如社区里有多少棵高大的树。
[00:21:51.520] because if there's a lot of tall trees it means that neighborhood has been there for a while it's not a lot of like new builds and like newer communities and stuff but it's kind of like a
[00:21:51.520] 因为如果有很多高大的树木，那就意味着这个社区已经存在很久了，不像很多新建的房屋或新兴社区那样，而是有点像……
[00:22:00.800] lived-in neighborhood with a lot of history if the trees are really tall then he knows that there is a lot of local history and that's what he's like drawn to maybe that's kind of why we're
[00:22:00.800] 如果树木很高，他就知道这片街区历史悠久，而且居民生活丰富，这或许就是他被吸引的原因。
[00:22:11.440] also drawn to things like vintage items and vintage looks because it's like tried and true a tested formula that works and if it has stood the test of time then it also speaks to like the
[00:22:11.440] 我也喜欢复古物品和复古造型，因为它们就像久经考验的经典之作，如果经受住了时间的考验，那就说明它们也符合某种理念。
[00:22:22.720] longevity of it as well I feel like when people look for houses and they're looking for like mid century modern houses they look for homes with like exposed beams and all like architectural
[00:22:22.720] 我觉得人们在寻找房子，尤其是像中世纪现代风格的房子时，会寻找带有裸露横梁等建筑特色的房屋，这也关系到房屋的耐久性。
[00:22:35.600] parts of a house that have stood the test of time I think people definitely get drawn to that too and I think it's also like maybe a rejection of the ultra capitalist society that we live in where
[00:22:35.600] 房屋中那些经受住时间考验的部分，我认为人们肯定会被它们所吸引，而且我认为这或许也是对我们所处的极端资本主义社会的一种反叛。
[00:22:48.880] now everything is like profit margins and how do we cut costs and increase prices and things like that like I feel like maybe even 30 years ago maybe the framework was still like how do we
[00:22:48.880] 现在一切都围绕着利润率，以及如何削减成本、提高价格等等。我觉得，即使在30年前，框架可能还是像这样：我们
[00:23:00.320] have profits but it was less so and less globally exploitative and things like that so quality of things back then like you said were also just better like better craftsmanship all around quality over quantity I think this also plays a part in as you're saying rejection of
[00:23:00.320] 虽然也有利润，但利润较少，而且在全球范围内剥削程度也较低等等。所以，正如你所说，当时的产品质量也更好，工艺更精湛，整体而言质量高于数量。我认为这也与你所说的拒绝有关。
[00:23:16.560] capitalistic stuff but also I read this interesting article about someone saying this could be like a rejection of perfection as we improve our technology you know things like AI or whatever produce quote-unquote perfect things that like are pleasing to the eye so I mean outside of AI
[00:23:16.560] 虽然这跟资本主义有关，但我还读到一篇很有意思的文章，里面有人说这可能是一种对完美的否定，因为我们的技术进步，比如人工智能之类的，会创造出所谓的“完美”事物，比如赏心悦目的东西。我的意思是，抛开人工智能不谈，这可能意味着对完美的一种否定。
[00:23:38.160] and technology an example is like people always say if you have a fully symmetric face that's like you know very attractive or like one of the I guess like ultimate highest standard of universal
[00:23:38.160] 科技方面，举个例子，就像人们常说的，如果你拥有一张完全对称的脸，那就非常有吸引力，或者说，这算是普遍意义上的最高标准之一。
[00:23:48.720] attractiveness or something so having like more of these vintage things or just things that aren't in the modern day are just reminders of like how imperfections are also really nice just because
[00:23:48.720] 吸引力之类的东西，所以拥有更多这类复古物品，或者说一些现代生活中不常见的东西，会提醒我们，不完美也很好，就因为如此。
[00:24:02.320] it's not you know a perfectly round circle doesn't mean that it's still not really cool to look at or aesthetic or you know things like that and I thought that was like a pretty good theory and I
[00:24:02.320] 你知道，一个完美的圆并不意味着它不好看，或者不美观之类的，我觉得这个理论挺不错的。
[00:24:14.640] can totally see how that plays a part because yeah a lot of things that we see nowadays are like super polished and then you know like the architectural digest videos of like visiting celebrity homes
[00:24:14.640] 完全明白这其中的原因，因为我们现在看到的很多东西都经过精心修饰，比如像《建筑文摘》里参观名人住宅的视频。
[00:24:26.800] yeah I feel like so many comments are always like oh my god this house looks too sterile like are you actually even living in this like it's way too staged but then if we see like a celebrity's home
[00:24:26.800] 是啊，我觉得很多评论都是“我的天哪，这房子看起来太冷清了，你真的住在这儿吗？感觉太像摆拍了。”但如果我们看到像名人的家……
[00:24:37.520] that looks much more cozy and like you know there's kind of blankets thrown around or like their kids toys around then all the comments are like oh my god like this truly looks like someone's
[00:24:37.520] 看起来温馨多了，就像到处都散落着毯子或者孩子的玩具一样，然后所有评论都说“我的天哪，这看起来真的像某人的家”。
[00:24:47.040] living in it it looks so comfortable doesn't matter that it's not pristine and like perfectly staged it's actually more attractive that it looks like people are actually inhabiting this house I think people are drawn to authenticity so that's probably why you know people are drawn to homes
[00:24:47.040] 住在里面感觉很舒服，即使它不是完美无瑕、精心布置的，也丝毫不影响它的魅力。事实上，正是因为看起来有人真正居住在这栋房子里，才更吸引人。我想人们会被真实感所吸引，这大概就是人们喜欢家的原因吧。
[00:25:04.720] with character or homes with examples of real life like toys and kids stuff all around rather than something that's sterile and perfectly staged right yeah I wonder if there's also a slightly more personal nostalgic factor that plays into this too so for me I remember flipping through
[00:25:04.720] 有特色的房子，或者摆放着玩具、儿童用品等真实生活场景的房子，而不是那种冷冰冰、完美布置的房子，对吧？嗯，我想这里面是不是也掺杂了一些个人怀旧的因素。对我来说，我记得我翻阅过……
[00:25:25.840] like my parents old photo albums when I was young you know back then the trends makeup trends fashion trends were all different right and I remember seeing old photos of my mom and she was probably
[00:25:25.840] 就像我小时候看父母的老相册一样，你知道，那时候的潮流，化妆潮流、时尚潮流都和现在很不一样，对吧？我记得看过我妈妈的老照片，她当时可能……
[00:25:36.400] like her in her early 30s and I would be like mom your lipstick is so brown and your hair is so curly and you're wearing pants that go up to your belly button like this fashion is so old and little did
[00:25:36.400] 比如她三十出头的时候，我会说：“妈，你的口红颜色好深啊，头发好卷啊，裤子都快到肚脐眼了，这种打扮也太老土了吧。” 当时我真不知道她是怎么想的。
[00:25:49.440] I know when I would be approaching the 30 year mark-ish that would be like exactly what's trending I feel like darker lipstick right now is like kind of in and high-waisted pants have been in
[00:25:49.440] 我知道，当我快到30岁左右的时候，潮流趋势就会完全符合我的预期。我觉得现在深色唇膏很流行，高腰裤也一直很流行。
[00:26:01.280] for the last few years and things like that and maybe part of it is just on a macro level like trends cycle through every couple of decades like we've been talking about but I think on a different
[00:26:01.280] 过去几年里，诸如此类的事情，也许部分原因只是宏观层面的，比如趋势每隔几十年就会循环一次，就像我们一直在讨论的那样，但我认为还有另一种可能。
[00:26:12.240] level too I am now nearing my mom's age that she was in those photos and maybe I kind of associate being 30 with like that look sort of so then it feels less foreign to me you know I'm like oh
[00:26:12.240] 我现在也快到我妈在那些照片里的年纪了，可能我有点把30岁和那种样子联系起来了，所以感觉没那么陌生，你知道吗，我就想，哦
[00:26:26.720] when my mom was this age like she had this look so I'm less opposed to it sort of I kind of fear the day where I decide to chop off my hair to like the mom look I'm trying to like yeah no
[00:26:26.720] 我妈在我这个年纪的时候就是这种打扮，所以我对这种打扮没那么抵触。不过，我有点害怕有一天我会为了模仿妈妈的造型而剪掉头发，是啊，我就是喜欢这种风格。
[00:26:43.120] and you like perm it and it's a little curly no I'm not getting there yet oh I think one of the funniest trends that I've seen that is like what you're saying kind of the more like mom and like
[00:26:43.120] 你喜欢烫发，它有点卷曲，不，我还没达到那种效果。哦，我觉得我见过最有趣的趋势之一就是你说的这种，有点像妈妈的风格，就像……
[00:26:57.760] dad look is the wireframe glasses oh because that's been like going on for a while now and the first time it popped up I was like oh my god my mom literally owns these glasses
[00:26:57.760] 爸爸的造型就是那种金属框眼镜，哦，因为这种风格已经流行一段时间了，第一次看到的时候我就想，我的天哪，我妈居然也有这种眼镜！
[00:27:10.640] true that's cute actually I have a funny story high-waisted pants were really really trendy like I remember wearing them in college I mean they still are people still wear high-waisted pants but most recently I found that low and mid-rise jeans and pants have been much more
[00:27:10.640] 确实挺可爱的。我有个有趣的故事，高腰裤曾经非常非常流行，我记得大学的时候就穿过。我的意思是，现在也还是有人穿高腰裤，但最近我发现低腰和中腰的牛仔裤和休闲裤更受欢迎。
[00:27:29.280] comfortable for my like midriff area just because like when I eat I want to be able to feel my like I don't want to be suffocated by my high-waisted jeans anyways I went on a work trip and I brought
[00:27:29.280] 我想要那种能让我的腰腹部感觉舒服的裤子，因为吃饭的时候我希望能够自由活动，不想被高腰牛仔裤勒得喘不过气来。总之，我出差的时候带了这条裤子。
[00:27:41.440] my like they're labeled low-rise they're like the aritzia pants effortless pants and I was trying to tell my co-workers yo like these are really comfortable like low and mid-rise jeans and
[00:27:41.440] 我觉得它们虽然标着低腰，但就像Aritzia的休闲裤一样，我当时就想跟同事们说，这些裤子真的很舒服，就像低腰和中腰牛仔裤一样。
[00:27:54.240] pants are the best thing ever and they were all laughing at me because they were saying no way they were saying how low and mid-rise were really really popular when they were younger and they
[00:27:54.240] 裤子是世界上最棒的东西，他们都在嘲笑我，因为他们说不可能，他们说低腰和中腰裤在他们年轻的时候非常非常流行，而且
[00:28:06.320] were not going back to that trend so it's just funny how they wanted to reject that trend but I feel like Gen Z and our like the younger generation is trying to bring back the low and
[00:28:06.320] 我们不会再回到那种潮流了，所以他们想要摒弃那种潮流的做法真是可笑，但我感觉Z世代和我们更年轻的一代正在试图重新流行低帮装。
[00:28:17.520] mid-rise pants I think it's also like dad shoes too yeah dad shoes oh my god I have this story that low-key is on my list of stories that keep me up at night but I remember once my parents went
[00:28:17.520] 我觉得中腰裤也像老爹鞋一样，对，老爹鞋，我的天哪，我有个故事，它一直让我夜不能寐，但我记得有一次我父母……
[00:28:31.440] to Costco and they like came back with a haul and my dad had bought the dad shoes like the dad shoe you know like the Kirkland whatever like really super chunky all white dad shoe and he was like oh
[00:28:31.440] 他们去了Costco，回来的时候带了一大堆东西，我爸买了一双老爹鞋，就是那种你知道的Kirkland牌子的，特别厚重的全白老爹鞋，他当时就说，哦
[00:28:44.400] geez look I bought these new shoes they're so comfortable so padded aren't they cute and I remember sitting there and I was like seeing two paths diverge in front of me and I was like I
[00:28:44.400] 哎呀，你看，我买了这双新鞋，它们太舒服了，鞋垫好厚，是不是很可爱？我记得当时我坐在那里，看到面前有两条路分岔，然后我就想，我
[00:28:53.840] could just be like yeah these are cute but I could also be honest elevate my dad's style and tell them they're ugly right so I sat there and I was like dad I'm not gonna lie like these are really hideous
[00:28:53.840] 我本来可以就说“嗯，这些挺可爱的”，但我也可以实话实说，提升我爸的品味，告诉他这些衣服很丑，对吧？所以我坐在那儿，跟他说：“爸，我实话实说，这些衣服真的太丑了。”
[00:29:03.680] I don't think you should wear them I feel like it might be a better idea to return them because they're like really ugly and he was like oh okay and I'll never forget the look on my dad's face
[00:29:03.680] 我觉得你不应该穿它们，最好还是退货，因为它们真的太丑了。他当时就“哦，好吧”，我永远也忘不了我爸当时的表情。
[00:29:12.160] because he looked so sad and I was like what have I done so fast forward like two years dad shoes are f**king in they're like the rage every skinny 20 year old girl is wearing them on the streets
[00:29:12.160] 因为他看起来很伤心，我就想我到底做了什么。然后时间快进到两年后，老爹鞋突然火爆起来，简直成了时尚潮流，每个身材苗条的20岁女孩都在街上穿着。
[00:29:25.120] and I was just like I feel so bad you know like little did I know they would come back and I also just hurt my dad's feelings for no reason so don't be like me damn Jesus oh hey it's okay you kept him cool for two years
[00:29:25.120] 我当时就觉得很愧疚，你知道吗？我根本没想到他们会回来，而且我还无缘无故地伤了我爸的心，所以千万别学我，我的天哪！哦，对了，没关系，你让他冷静了两年。
[00:29:46.400] that's true that's pretty good as far as how long trends last seriously though but maybe your dad has been seeing these chunky dad shoes on the street and he's like damn Jisoo was right like why the f**k are these in style now
[00:29:46.400] 确实，就潮流持续时间而言，这已经很不错了。不过说真的，也许你爸爸最近在街上看到过这种厚底老爹鞋，然后他会想：我去，Jisoo说得对，这玩意儿怎么又流行起来了？
[00:30:03.120] your dad knew he did he knew what was coming exactly maybe he has foresight but also your story about low-rise jeans Aileen reminded me so I've mentioned this before but
[00:30:03.120] 你爸爸知道他确实知道，他确切地知道会发生什么，也许他有先见之明，但你讲的关于低腰牛仔裤的故事，艾琳，也让我想起了这件事，所以我之前也提过。
[00:30:16.240] on TikTok I'm on millennial talk so I see actually so many not as much now but for a period of time I saw so many TikToks about rejecting low-rise they showed so many pictures of like you know
[00:30:16.240] 我在TikTok上关注千禧一代的话题，所以实际上我看到了很多相关的内容，虽然现在没那么多了，但有一段时间我看到很多TikTok视频都在讨论拒绝低层建筑，他们展示了很多照片，你知道的。
[00:30:29.920] the pants that are too low and like the peaking butt crack and all that stuff okay not that low we're not going that low but I do think that like super low rise is pretty accurate to that time
[00:30:29.920] 那种裤子太低，露出屁股沟的，好吧，我们不会那么低，但我认为那种超低腰的风格在那个年代还是挺贴切的。
[00:30:41.520] I'm thinking of like Britney Spears like Jessica Simpson like all that but I do agree with mid-rise being good because personally I've never bought super into high rise just because I'm like dude
[00:30:41.520] 我想到的是像布兰妮·斯皮尔斯、杰西卡·辛普森之类的，但我确实同意中腰裤很好，因为我个人从来都不太喜欢高腰裤，就因为我觉得……
[00:30:54.400] I'm trying to sit down and like eat a big meal so I'm all for bringing back mid-rise yeah mid-rise is a way to go but that I feel like that does kind of relate to what we've mentioned earlier where
[00:30:54.400] 我正想坐下来好好吃顿饭，所以我非常赞成重新流行中腰裤，没错，中腰裤是个不错的选择，但我觉得这和我们之前提到的有点关系，
[00:31:08.160] like part of a pro of thrifting is that if there's like a style that's not really existing right now in terms of the stores aren't really selling it because it's not on trend then maybe you can find
[00:31:08.160] 逛二手店的好处之一就是，如果某种风格现在市面上已经不流行了，商店里也不怎么卖，那么你或许能找到。
[00:31:19.120] it when you're thrifting so maybe during the time where I was just high-waisted pants everywhere maybe if you really wanted an alternative style you could go thrifting and see if you could find
[00:31:19.120] 当你逛二手店的时候，也许在我穿高腰裤风靡一时的那段时间里，如果你真的想要一种另类的风格，你可以去二手店看看能不能找到。
[00:31:30.400] something like that that's true it's almost like a time capsule to find things are not sold in popular stores today but are definitely at thrift stores yeah like what happened to all those circle scars
[00:31:30.400] 确实如此，感觉就像打开了一个时光胶囊，能找到现在主流商店里买不到的东西，但在旧货店里却能找到。是啊，比如那些圆形疤痕饰品都去哪儿了？
[00:31:42.560] we used to wear oh my god oh definitely can find those at goodwill I'm sure at this point you have to go to an antique market what if they come back in like 10 years like should we be keeping everything in our closet
[00:31:42.560] 我们以前穿过的，我的天哪，肯定能在二手店找到。不过现在你肯定得去古董市场了。万一十年后它们又流行起来了怎么办？我们是不是应该把所有东西都留在衣柜里？
[00:31:58.320] just to wait for the next time the trend comes around no that one's gotta go I'm just kidding I don't even know what was appealing about circle scarves maybe it was just it would never fall off your neck like maybe it was a functional like aspect
[00:31:58.320] 就等着下次潮流再来？不，那玩意儿得扔了。我开玩笑的，我甚至不知道圆丝巾的吸引力在哪儿，也许是因为它永远不会从脖子上滑落，也许是因为它实用吧。
[00:32:15.200] of it you just wrap it around your neck instead of you know an annoying scarf that always falls off your neck or your shoulder I would love to see like devil wears prada there was one part
[00:32:15.200] 你只需要把它围在脖子上，而不是像那种总是从脖子或肩膀上滑落的烦人围巾。我很想看到像《穿普拉达的女王》里那样的场景，其中有一部分
[00:32:27.520] of that movie where they said that it starts at these fashion houses and then those trends trickle down into you know what we see in stores and so I think about will a fashion house bring
[00:32:27.520] 那部电影里说，潮流是从时装屋开始的，然后这些潮流会逐渐渗透到我们在商店里看到的东西中。所以我在想，时装屋会带来什么？
[00:32:40.960] back circle scars and will eventually find its way to us so I yeah I will look forward to I don't know some tiktoks it would be really fascinating if if we see like a fashion house
[00:32:40.960] 背部的圆形疤痕最终会找到我们，所以，是的，我会期待，我不知道一些TikTok视频，如果我们能看到像时装屋那样的作品，那将非常有趣。
[00:32:52.880] bring back circle scarves kind of doubt it but oh my god I know exactly what scene you're talking about it's the one where she's like yeah you just chose a blue sweater but that blue is like from
[00:32:52.880] 把圆围巾带回来？我有点怀疑，但是我的天哪，我完全知道你在说什么场景，就是她说“是啊，你选了件蓝色毛衣，但那蓝色就像是……”的那个场景。
[00:33:04.080] this season like we had to make all these decisions yeah it's not lapis or whatever and she's like and you just picked that sweater out of like a discount bin like five years after
[00:33:04.080] 这季我们得做这么多决定，对，这又不是青金石什么的，然后她就说，你五年前才从打折区挑了件毛衣。
[00:33:15.200] the trend yeah damn yeah iconic when I watch youtube videos about trends of 2024 they always reference what is shown on the runway and so that to me it reminded me of devil wears prada in that
[00:33:15.200] 这股潮流，没错，简直太经典了！我看YouTube上关于2024年潮流趋势的视频时，他们总是会提到T台上的展示，这让我想起了《穿普拉达的女王》。
[00:33:32.160] scene of whatever we see on the runway can trickle down into more mainstream or like everyday stores I do kind of want to bring us back to like the personal style part of this all though
[00:33:32.160] 我们在T台上看到的一切，都可能逐渐渗透到更主流的渠道，或者像日常商店里。不过，我确实想把我们带回到个人风格这个话题上来。
[00:33:46.080] so do you think your personal style developing it curating it is empowering just because in my mind I feel like it's very expressive it's like almost the first impression that you leave on people
[00:33:46.080] 所以你觉得发展和完善个人风格会让你更有力量吗？因为我觉得它非常能表达自我，几乎就像你给别人留下的第一印象。
[00:34:00.880] but I mean personally I don't put that much time into like developing as much of a unique style so I wonder like what your thoughts are on it as someone who's like much more into fashion and like
[00:34:00.880] 但就我个人而言，我并没有花太多时间去培养自己独特的风格，所以我很好奇你作为一个更关注时尚的人，对此有什么看法。
[00:34:13.600] curating this image I definitely think defining my personal style is very empowering I mean it's it's definitely something that I noticed when other people also put intentionality and thought into it as well I think personal style for me yeah like a reflection of how I'm feeling
[00:34:13.600] 精心挑选这张照片的过程中，我确实觉得定义自己的个人风格非常有力量。我的意思是，我注意到当其他人也用心思考并打造个人风格时，这种感觉尤为强烈。对我来说，个人风格就像是我内心感受的反映。
[00:34:34.560] and if I feel really good about what I'm wearing I feel like I feel a lot more confident and I can carry myself a lot more confidently so sometimes when I meet people for the first time or I go to
[00:34:34.560] 如果我对自己的穿着感觉很好，我就会感觉自信很多，举手投足间也会更加自信。所以有时候，当我第一次见到别人或者去……
[00:34:46.240] an event I will wear something that I know I'm comfortable wearing it like I'm comfortable it's almost like second skin like I'm comfortable wearing that certain piece or I know I won't
[00:34:46.240] 如果是参加活动，我会穿我知道自己穿起来很舒服的衣服，那种舒服就像第二层皮肤一样，感觉很自在，或者我知道穿那件衣服我不会觉得尴尬。
[00:34:56.400] have to fennec around with it or it will be oh it'll make me uncomfortable later in the day or sometimes I might wear a piece where it could be a conversation starter so for example recently
[00:34:56.400] 我得小心翼翼地佩戴它，否则过一会儿就会觉得不舒服。有时候我可能会戴一些能引发话题的饰品，比如最近。
[00:35:07.520] I thrifted this like denim skirt in Japan that I really love it's comfortable I think it's cute it also emphasizes my personal style because it's a denim skirt I know that if another girly
[00:35:07.520] 我在日本的二手店淘到了这条我很喜欢的牛仔裙，它很舒服，我觉得也很可爱，而且因为是牛仔裙，所以很能凸显我的个人风格。我知道如果另一个女孩也喜欢它，那她一定会喜欢的。
[00:35:19.200] recognizes that and is like hey I love your skirt I'm like cool I can like start a conversation about it I could say like I thrifted it in Japan and that will start like a whole conversation
[00:35:19.200] 注意到这一点，然后说：“嘿，我喜欢你的裙子。” 我觉得很棒，我可以就此展开对话。我可以说：“这条裙子是我在日本的二手店淘到的。” 这样就能开启一段完整的对话了。
[00:35:29.120] around like oh you went to Japan so I feel like personal style can be a conversation starter it can be a way to connect people together like I met Camille because she complimented me on my pants
[00:35:29.120] 比如，有人会说“哦，你去过日本”，我觉得个人风格可以成为开启对话的契机，也可以成为连接人与人的方式。就像我认识卡米尔是因为她夸我的裤子好看一样。
[00:35:40.800] back in college and that's how we became friends and I think personal style just it says a lot about you as a person I think and and in your taste so I feel like if other girls or people
[00:35:40.800] 大学的时候我们就是这样成为朋友的，我觉得个人风格能反映出一个人的很多特质和品味。所以我觉得如果其他女生或者其他人也这样，他们也会关注你的个人风格。
[00:35:53.760] have that same taste it's a way to connect with each other I love that because I feel like it can definitely be a form of self-expression I feel like as someone who is a little bit less
[00:35:53.760] 拥有相同的品味是一种彼此联系的方式，我喜欢这一点，因为我觉得这绝对是一种自我表达的方式。作为一个性格稍微不那么外向的人，我觉得
[00:36:04.880] fashionable sometimes it feels like an obligation like I wake up I'm like oh I have to find an outfit again I feel that too but I think I know what you mean there's just like certain
[00:36:04.880] 有时候穿衣打扮感觉像是一种义务，比如我早上醒来就想，哦，我又得找套衣服了。我也有这种感觉，但我想我明白你的意思，就是有些事情……
[00:36:18.000] outfits or certain looks where I'm like I know I slay this outfit so going to an event with that can make me feel like the best version of myself or I know that the way it makes me look and feel
[00:36:18.000] 有些衣服或者造型，我知道自己穿这身肯定很惊艳，所以穿着它去参加活动会让我感觉自己状态最佳，或者说，我知道它让我看起来和感觉都很棒。
[00:36:30.400] just gives me a lot of confidence so definitely some empowerment there although I will say that sometimes I feel like I look a certain way and then someone has a comment about how I look and
[00:36:30.400] 这确实给了我很大的自信，也确实增强了我的自信心。不过，有时候我觉得自己看起来不错，然后别人又会评价我的外貌。
[00:36:41.600] I'm like whoa is that how I portray myself because once my friend was like you always look like you're ready to go to the office and I was like is that really how I look? You're a corporate girlie. I'm like business casual.
[00:36:41.600] 我当时就想，哇，我给人的印象就是这样吗？因为我朋友曾经说过，你看起来总是像随时准备去上班一样，我就想，我真的是那个样子吗？你看起来像个职场女性。我明明穿的是商务休闲装。
[00:36:58.080] Oh that's funny I still remember I felt like when I first joined the corporate world or at least even back in college corporate workwear to me just felt so stale I remember
[00:36:58.080] 哦，真有意思，我还记得我刚进入职场，或者至少在大学的时候，我觉得职业装特别没劲儿。
[00:37:13.680] early on just being like I can fit the mold in some ways but I want to break out of that too so like obviously I don't want to show too much skin or like I still want to wear pants but like
[00:37:13.680] 一开始我就觉得，我在某些方面可以符合这种模式，但我也想打破这种模式，所以很明显我不想露太多皮肤，或者说我仍然想穿裤子，但是……
[00:37:25.280] can they be you know wide leg trousers can they be a colored trouser can I wear like a belt or change things up a little bit so I always feel like there are certain like even for some some
[00:37:25.280] 可以是阔腿裤吗？可以是彩色裤子吗？我可以系腰带或者稍微改变一下搭配吗？所以我总觉得有些搭配方式是可以的，即使对某些人来说也是如此。
[00:37:36.000] of those looks like corporate workwear there are certain not guidelines but it's almost like there's a skeleton you know like a framework yeah there's a framework but personal style is when you kind of
[00:37:36.000] 那些看起来像企业工作服的款式，虽然没有固定的规则，但就像有一个框架一样，你知道，就像一个骨架。是的，确实有一个框架，但个人风格是你……
[00:37:48.480] break out of that framework a little bit or you accessorize above that framework or you you know choose things like color or shape or texture that kind of break out of that typical framework that
[00:37:48.480] 稍微打破一下那种框架，或者在框架之上添加一些配饰，或者选择一些颜色、形状或纹理之类的东西，来打破那种典型的框架。
[00:38:01.760] I feel like helps you identify the personal style a bit more. Dude but what if you're like trying a new style but you don't feel confident about it like how do you grow into that then? I would say
[00:38:01.760] 我觉得这能帮你更好地了解自己的个人风格。哥们，但如果你想尝试一种新风格，但又没自信，那该怎么慢慢适应呢？我觉得……
[00:38:14.240] either don't force it just don't do it yeah like if you don't feel comfortable in it don't do it I remember there were some cute tops that were like really trending and I was just like you know
[00:38:14.240] 要么别勉强自己，要么就别穿。对，如果你觉得不舒服就别穿。我记得当时有些很流行的可爱上衣，我就觉得……你知道的。
[00:38:25.840] with my body type like I feel too flashy I feel too like uncomfortable with it I'm just not if I'm not comfortable in it it's too finicky like I'm just not even gonna try and then I guess the
[00:38:25.840] 就我的体型而言，我觉得穿得太招摇了，感觉很不自在。如果穿得不舒服，我就不想穿，太麻烦了，我甚至都不愿意尝试。然后我想……
[00:38:37.360] second tip is if you still want to try it maybe add something to it to make it more comfortable so if the top is too revealing is there a way to have like a certain part of it like another piece
[00:38:37.360] 第二个建议是，如果你仍然想尝试，可以添加一些东西让它更舒适。例如，如果上衣太暴露，可以考虑用其他布料遮盖一部分。
[00:38:48.960] to add on top of it so it's not less revealing I don't know is there a way to style it differently so you do feel comfortable in it but I would say overall if you're not comfortable don't force it.
[00:38:48.960] 为了避免显得不够暴露，我不知道有没有办法通过不同的搭配让你感觉更舒适，但总的来说，如果你觉得不舒服，就不要勉强自己。
[00:39:00.480] That kind of reminds me of have you seen the TikTok video where that lady is teaching you how to acclimate to the temperature of the water so she's like put your hands in the water put your
[00:39:00.480] 这让我想起你有没有看过那个TikTok视频，那个女士教你如何适应水温，她会说把手伸进水里，把手伸进……
[00:39:08.400] arms in the water and it's just like I guess easing into the temperature of the water and I feel like that can honestly be applied to a lot of things in life because there's certain pieces
[00:39:08.400] 把胳膊伸进水里，感觉就像慢慢适应水温一样。我觉得这其实可以应用到生活的很多方面，因为其中有些环节是不可或缺的。
[00:39:18.000] in my closet where I'm like mildly embarrassed to wear it around people I know but that doesn't mean I can't wear it around strangers or to like grocery shop or like something like that
[00:39:18.000] 我衣柜里有一件，穿去认识的人面前我会有点不好意思，但这并不意味着我不能穿去陌生人面前，或者去超市之类的场合。
[00:39:28.080] so I think easing into it in that way could also help. That's true yeah maybe it's finding the situations or the right context for you to feel comfortable wearing it and trying it out
[00:39:28.080] 所以我觉得循序渐进地尝试一下也可能有帮助。没错，或许关键在于找到合适的场合或情境，让你感觉穿着它很自在，然后尝试一下。
[00:39:40.960] I like that. Do you think you aim to portray a certain thing about yourself through your personal style or is it more just like this is just a collection of things that I enjoy to wear?
[00:39:40.960] 我喜欢这样。你觉得你的个人风格是想展现某种自我特质，还是仅仅把我喜欢穿的衣服都穿在身上？
[00:39:53.440] I don't know I mean I definitely like to be portrayed as fashionable. Oh well I think that's fair yeah. I mean not all the time like when I go out to eat I'm not like I want to be fashionable
[00:39:53.440] 我不知道，我的意思是，我当然喜欢被人看作是时尚的。哦，我觉得这很公平。我的意思是，也不是所有时候都这样，比如我出去吃饭的时候，我不会刻意打扮得时尚。
[00:40:07.120] I want people to know I'm fashionable but I think maybe for certain occasions meeting people for the first time I definitely like to be portrayed as fashionable or has an eye for fashion I think
[00:40:07.120] 我希望别人知道我很有时尚感，但我觉得在某些场合，比如第一次见人的时候，我肯定希望自己看起来时尚，或者至少对时尚有眼光。
[00:40:21.440] deep down that's probably what I think but I'm not like today I want to be known as fashionable like when I go out at this event they better damn know I'm fashionable.
[00:40:21.440] 内心深处我可能也是这么想的，但我今天不想以时尚著称，比如我参加这个活动的时候，他们最好知道我很时尚。
[00:40:30.640] Better be getting DMs like where did you get your outfit from? Exactly like I'm not trying to do that but I think like you know the inner me is like if I get a compliment tonight on my
[00:40:30.640] 最好能收到私信问我“你的衣服在哪儿买的？”之类的。虽然我不是故意要这么做，但你知道，我内心其实很想：如果我今晚收到别人对我衣服的赞美，我会很开心的。
[00:40:41.040] on this skirt that I chose or like the shoes that's gonna bring joy you know. I think that makes sense for me I feel like I try to seem polished maybe that's why the business casual
[00:40:41.040] 这条裙子，还有这双鞋，我选的，都让我心情愉悦，你知道吗？我觉得这对我来说很合适，我感觉自己想让自己看起来精致优雅，也许这就是为什么我选择商务休闲风的原因吧。
[00:40:53.920] opinion was once shared but I think also there's like a certain image that I have in mind based on the setting that I'm going to so like when I go golf or something I like think of like the
[00:40:53.920] 以前也有人表达过类似的观点，但我认为，根据我要去的环境，我脑海中也会浮现出某种特定的画面。比如，当我去打高尔夫球或其他什么活动时，我就会想象自己身处其中……
[00:41:06.320] golf girl look or like you know like there's something in my head when I put together an outfit or like an ensemble that I go for so maybe it's not always just like a permanent personality
[00:41:06.320] 高尔夫球手的造型，或者你知道的，就像我搭配衣服或服装时脑子里会想着某种风格，所以这可能并不总是一种固定的性格。
[00:41:15.680] thing that I'm trying to portray but just specific snapshots of images that I'm like oh this is like the look I want to have today. Sometimes I wonder when I go on work trips and I choose my outfit I
[00:41:15.680] 我想表达的是一种特定的感觉，但其实只是一些特定的画面，比如我会想，哦，这就是我今天想要的造型。有时候我会想，当我出差的时候，我挑选衣服的时候……
[00:41:26.480] wonder if people look at me and are like that's definitely a designer like like like she like the way she dresses the way she looks she's definitely a designer. I always wonder that I wonder if people
[00:41:26.480] 我总是好奇别人会不会看着我说：“这绝对是个设计师，看她的穿着打扮，她的长相，肯定是个设计师。”
[00:41:37.920] think that because different roles at my company there's definitely like a general you know theme that happens like engineers are really casual designers are definitely a lot more dressy so I wonder if people see me and they think that they clock you. Yeah it's because I'm Asian too
[00:41:37.920] 我觉得可能是因为公司里不同岗位的着装风格差异，比如工程师穿得比较随意，设计师则比较正式，所以我就想，别人看到我的时候会不会觉得他们认出我了。嗯，也可能是因为我也是亚洲人。
[00:41:59.760] designers are Asian. They're like nah she's definitely an engineer. Yeah but I mean I think that's getting into stereotypes which is not so great there's definitely engineers that are really stylish too. It's okay you don't have to try to save it.
[00:41:59.760] 设计师都是亚洲人。他们会说，不，她肯定是个工程师。是啊，但我觉得这有点刻板印象了，不太好，当然也有很多工程师很时尚。没关系，你不用刻意去纠正。
[00:42:18.720] Put it on the record. On the walk back. Engineers listening to this like what the f**k girl you were hella stylish. There's also like different fashion I noticed in my company is in New York so I go to New York
[00:42:18.720] 把它录下来。在回来的路上。工程师们听着，都惊呆了，心想：这姑娘，你当时真是太有型了。我还注意到，我们公司在纽约，所以大家的穿衣风格也不一样。所以我去了纽约。
[00:42:34.800] trips the fashion there is obviously fashion capital versus when I used to work in SF. Very techy very like Patagonia athleisure wear I guess so the style is very very different.
[00:42:34.800] 那里的时尚风格显然与我以前在旧金山工作时截然不同，那里显然是时尚之都。那里的科技感很强，很像巴塔哥尼亚的运动休闲装，所以风格非常非常不一样。
[00:42:47.760] Dude for sure one time I went into a New York office and I literally like the first time ever I felt like wow I don't feel like I'm cool enough to be in this office like why is everyone dressed
[00:42:47.760] 哥们儿，有一次我去纽约一家办公室，那真是我有生以来第一次感觉自己不够酷，配不上待在这个办公室里，为什么每个人都穿得那么正式？
[00:42:59.600] so well I'm so used to the Bay Area where people are like practically in their pjs. Yeah everyone in New York dresses really really well. I always feel like my dressing up to a 10 there is everyone's normal. Oh especially in Korea everyone was dressed to the 10s. Right.
[00:42:59.600] 太习惯湾区了，那里的人几乎都穿着睡衣。是啊，纽约人个个都穿得特别讲究。我总觉得我精心打扮一番在那里是理所当然的。哦，尤其是在韩国，每个人都穿得特别讲究。没错。
[00:43:21.280] I was like wow everyone looks so good and Japan as well like everyone was very expressive with their fashion. Do you think you would enjoy that more living in a very fashionable city
[00:43:21.280] 我当时就想，哇，每个人看起来都好棒，日本也是，感觉每个人都非常注重穿搭。你觉得住在这样一个时尚之都你会更喜欢吗？
[00:43:32.560] versus one that's more maybe like casual? I think I mean there's always a middle ground I guess like if I had to dress up every single day and like have makeup every single day I think I would feel
[00:43:32.560] 相比之下，休闲一点的打扮怎么样？我觉得总会有折中的办法，比如如果我每天都得精心打扮，每天都要化妆，我想我会觉得……
[00:43:44.080] tired of it eventually but the other side of it is like in Sacramento no offense sometimes I feel like I'm overdressed and it kind of feel like I have to underdress sometimes
[00:43:44.080] 最终会厌倦的，但另一方面，就像在萨克拉门托，无意冒犯，有时我觉得自己穿得太正式了，有时又觉得好像必须穿得随意些。
[00:43:58.080] because I need to fit in or like because I don't know I just don't want to be too flashy when I'm over like when I'm dressing too much so I feel like sometimes that I don't enjoy that sometimes
[00:43:58.080] 因为我需要融入群体，或者，我也不知道为什么，我就是不想在公共场合太招摇，比如穿得太隆重，所以有时候我觉得那样反而不好受。
[00:44:09.440] I love to dress up as well and I wish I could you know dress up more but I don't want to also draw too much attention. I think I try to find the middle ground here. What elements do you guys
[00:44:09.440] 我也很喜欢打扮，真希望可以多打扮打扮一些，但又不想太引人注目。我觉得我应该能找到一个平衡点。你们觉得打扮应该包含哪些元素呢？
[00:44:21.600] think inspire your personal style? This is an interesting one to me because I consume a lot of social media content like I'm on TikTok for a crazy number of hours on the daily
[00:44:21.600] 你觉得这些能激发你的个人风格吗？这个问题对我来说很有意思，因为我每天都会花很多时间浏览社交媒体内容，比如我每天都会在TikTok上花费大量时间。
[00:44:37.680] and I think I realized that I need to be able to picture something for it to be appealing to me so what I mean is like if I see something on like a store website for example I might be like oh
[00:44:37.680] 我觉得我意识到，我需要能够想象出某样东西的样子，它才会吸引我。我的意思是，比如我在商店网站上看到某样东西，我可能会想：哦
[00:44:51.520] this is cute but I don't know if I like really want to buy it you know but if I see someone who looks like me or has a similar sense of style as me or lives in the same area as me or has some
[00:44:51.520] 这东西挺可爱的，但我不知道自己是不是真的想买。不过，如果我看到有人长得像我，或者穿衣风格跟我相似，或者住在同一个地区，或者有类似的衣服，我可能就会买了。
[00:45:03.600] sort of connection slash similarity wearing it then it's way more appealing to me so unfortunately I feel like I have to literally directly see someone who I can kind of relate to wear it and
[00:45:03.600] 如果能和某个人产生某种联系或相似感，穿上它对我来说就更有吸引力了。所以很遗憾，我觉得我必须亲眼看到一个和我有某种共鸣的人穿它才行。
[00:45:16.400] then I'm like oh this is cute like now I want it. Is it anyone on the street that you think looks like you or is it specific people online or both? I think it's like both like I just need to see
[00:45:16.400] 然后我就觉得，哦，这个好可爱，我现在就想要。你觉得街上哪个人长得像你，还是网上某个特定的人，或者两者都有？我觉得两者都有，我就是想看看。
[00:45:28.720] someone in my vicinity somehow like wear it and then I can be like oh this is cute like I can see this going with that kind of outfit like I guess I'm saying I'm not super imaginative to where
[00:45:28.720] 我身边有人不知怎么就穿上了，然后我就会想，哦，这挺可爱的，我觉得这件衣服可以搭配那种风格的衣服。我想说的是，我的想象力其实不太丰富。
[00:45:39.120] I could see a piece and be like oh now I envision 40 outfits with this you know it's more like I need to see specific fits and curated looks and then I'm like oh okay this seems like something I
[00:45:39.120] 我可能会看到一件单品，然后想：哦，现在我脑海里浮现出40套搭配了。你知道，我更需要看到的是具体的搭配和精心搭配的造型，然后我才会想：哦，好吧，这看起来挺适合我的。
[00:45:49.520] could work into my closet. I resonate with that like I actually use Pinterest a lot for inspiration I like to see pictures of other people styling certain pieces before I like commit to you know
[00:45:49.520] 或许可以放进我的衣橱里。我深有同感，因为我经常用Pinterest找灵感，我喜欢在决定买什么之前先看看别人是怎么搭配的，你知道的。
[00:46:03.280] spending money on something or investing in something. I actually do a lot of research before I buy something like just recently I bought some new shoes they're not super bold but they're like brown shoes and I've never styled brown shoes before so I literally searched up brown
[00:46:03.280] 花钱买东西或者投资东西。我买东西之前其实会做很多功课，比如最近我买了双新鞋，款式不算特别出众，但是是棕色的，我以前从来没搭配过棕色鞋，所以我就上网搜了棕色鞋的搭配。
[00:46:17.520] shoe outfits and I looked at all these images of outfits and just double checked whether or not that would fit into my current pieces in my closet but then I also you know think back at my closet
[00:46:17.520] 我看了各种鞋子搭配的图片，仔细检查了这些搭配是否能和我衣橱里现有的衣服搭配，然后我又回头想想我的衣橱……
[00:46:31.120] would brown shoes complement current outfits that I like to wear? Would it be something that can easily style? So I definitely seek inspiration from external sources as well and also friends too
[00:46:31.120] 棕色鞋子能搭配我目前喜欢的穿搭吗？容易搭配吗？所以我肯定会从外界和朋友那里寻找灵感。
[00:46:43.200] so if I go on Instagram I see friends with really cool you know outfit I'm like oh that just inspired me and I want to try something like that too or look out for something like that when I shop
[00:46:43.200] 所以，如果我上Instagram，看到朋友们穿搭很酷，我就会想，哦，这给了我灵感，我也想尝试一下，或者在购物的时候留意类似的款式。
[00:46:55.200] so definitely like to seek inspiration as well. I think for me something that I also keep an eye out for is like staple items like what is something that can be used across a lot of different
[00:46:55.200] 所以，我当然也喜欢寻找灵感。我觉得对我来说，我还会留意一些经典单品，比如可以用于很多不同场合的物品。
[00:47:08.880] situations? I guess now that I'm thinking about it consistency is something that I look for. I think it just makes things easier sometimes if there's like too many options or like I don't know what I'm doing then maybe I'll feel more uncomfortable so ultimately it's like what
[00:47:08.880] 情况？我想现在想想，我确实很在意稳定性。我觉得有时候稳定性会让事情变得更容易。如果选择太多，或者我不知道自己在做什么，反而会让我感到不自在。所以归根结底，这就像……
[00:47:25.440] is going to make me feel comfortable and what is something that is going to be like applicable in various situations? I guess like as an example very specifically like imagine you're gonna go
[00:47:25.440] 什么能让我感到舒适？什么又能在各种情况下都适用？举个具体的例子，想象一下你要去……
[00:47:36.560] somewhere and you're gonna meet all these new people but if you get to like I don't know wear your favorite jacket then you know you'll feel really okay because you have a piece of like you
[00:47:36.560] 在某个地方，你会遇到很多新朋友，但如果你能穿上你最喜欢的夹克，你就会感觉特别好，因为你拥有了属于你自己的东西。
[00:47:47.360] have something of comfort with you versus like you're trying to go all out and like impress everyone and then you're like oh god I like have never worn this outfit before so I don't know like
[00:47:47.360] 穿得舒服自在一点，而不是像你想全力以赴给所有人留下深刻印象那样，然后你突然意识到“天哪，我以前从来没穿过这身衣服，所以我不知道该怎么搭配”。
[00:47:58.320] who I am right now or like what I'm doing right now so I guess kind of along those like lines. Yeah you like things that are tried and true. Now I'm just imagining like a emotional support jacket.
[00:47:58.320] 就是我现在的状态，或者说我现在正在做的事情，大概就是这些方面吧。嗯，你喜欢那些经过验证、行之有效的方法。我现在想象的就像一件情感支持外套。
[00:48:14.640] A life jacket? Oh my god wait line blown but you know like people in sports and stuff they're like yeah I wear like my lucky underwear. Oh yeah. So it's kind of like that right it's like something
[00:48:14.640] 救生衣？我的天，排队的人太多了，但你知道，就像体育界的人那样，他们会说，是啊，我穿我的幸运内裤。哦，对。所以有点像那样，对吧，就像某种东西。
[00:48:27.600] that'll bring you like comfort and like luck and familiarity. But I also feel like that means you you don't over consume like you don't over buy which is really good too you don't buy more than
[00:48:27.600] 那会给你带来舒适感、好运和熟悉感。但我觉得那也意味着你不会过度消费，不会过度购买，这也非常好，你不会买超过你所需的东西。
[00:48:38.880] you need everything that you have provides some sort of functional value that you don't need to over consume or buy too much. Yeah but I think there's definitely maybe some moments where
[00:48:38.880] 你需要确保你拥有的每样东西都具有某种实用价值，这样你就不需要过度消费或购买太多东西。是的，但我认为肯定有一些时候，
[00:48:48.720] I don't know maybe I'm like feeling myself or whatever and then I buy something and I'm like wait what was I on because this is definitely not something like you know. Dude I feel that. Yeah like I shouldn't have bought this like I don't know why I did.
[00:48:48.720] 我不知道，可能是我当时感觉自己棒极了什么的，然后我就买了东西，之后我就想，等等，我当时在想什么？因为这绝对不是那种……你知道的。兄弟，我懂那种感觉。是啊，我不该买这个的，我也不知道我当时为什么会买。
[00:49:02.720] Like you wake up from the fever dream you're like okay we need to head back and return this immediately. Like who authorized this purchase? Exactly yeah. You know how they joke around like bury me in
[00:49:02.720] 就像你从一场高烧梦中醒来，你会想：好吧，我们得赶紧回去把这东西退了。谁授权买的？没错。你知道他们开玩笑说“把我埋在……”
[00:49:14.640] this outfit or bury me with this? What is one article of clothing your house is on fire if you have to save one piece of clothing what would it be? Dang. Wait I'm not gonna lie I feel
[00:49:14.640] 要么穿这身衣服，要么穿着它下葬？如果房子着火了，你只能救一件衣服，你会选什么？哎。等等，说实话，我感觉……
[00:49:26.480] like most of the things oh wait actually I do know one of the things so there's like these pants that I wear and they're like discontinued so I literally had to go on eBay and I bought like three or four
[00:49:26.480] 就像大多数东西一样，哦等等，其实我知道一件，就是我常穿的那条裤子，它好像停产了，所以我只好去eBay上买了三四条。
[00:49:39.920] of these pants because I was like I don't know if they'll ever come back so I would probably grab at least one of those. That's good. Okay so I have this pair of black sandals like strappy sandals
[00:49:39.920] 我买这条裤子是因为我想，我不知道它还会不会再上架，所以我可能至少会买一条。这很好。好的，我还有这双黑色凉鞋，就是那种带绑带的凉鞋。
[00:49:52.560] that I bought years ago I'm talking like mid-college and then I have gotten so many compliments on them but it's obviously been over seven years since I've had them so they're like scuffed on the side
[00:49:52.560] 那是我几年前买的，大概是大学中期的时候，之后很多人都夸过它们好看，但毕竟已经七年多了，所以侧面有点磨损。
[00:50:06.480] and shit but I can't let them go because they're so cute and I can't find like a similar quality replacement so I still have them but I think those are my go-to's. I was gonna actually say
[00:50:06.480] 唉，但我舍不得它们，因为它们太可爱了，而且我找不到质量差不多的替代品，所以我还留着它们，我觉得它们是我最常用的。我本来想说……
[00:50:18.160] running shoes for me I mean I think it goes down to like functionality at the end of the day I realized in the past few years how important running shoes are running and walking shoes are
[00:50:18.160] 对我来说，跑鞋最重要的还是功能性。过去几年我才意识到跑鞋的重要性，跑步鞋和步行鞋都是如此。
[00:50:30.320] for my feet and it can really make a difference so even after walking like 20,000 steps a day in Asia because I had proper walking running shoes it really made a difference in my feet and I didn't
[00:50:30.320] 对我的脚来说，这真的非常重要。即使在亚洲每天走两万步，因为我穿了合适的步行跑鞋，我的脚也感觉好多了，而且我没有……
[00:50:41.920] have blisters I didn't have feet pain like I did back in 2017 when I didn't have proper walking shoes so really made a difference in that probably be something I could not live without.
[00:50:41.920] 虽然脚上起了水泡，但我的脚不像 2017 年那样疼痛了，当时我没有合适的步行鞋，所以这真的有很大的不同，这可能是我离不开的东西了。
[00:50:54.480] Well this has been super interesting because I feel like all three of us have slightly different styles and slightly different approaches to our personal styles.
