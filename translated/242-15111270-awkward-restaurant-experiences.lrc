[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Obby.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Obby。
[00:00:16.820] Welcome back, Obby. The last episode that Obby was on with us was episode 199, Wedding Plus One
[00:00:16.820] 欢迎回来，奥比。奥比上次和我们一起参加节目是第199集，《婚礼加一》。
[00:00:25.060] Guest Duties, which was a fun episode and I feel like we covered a lot of useful tips and funny
[00:00:25.060] 《嘉宾职责》这期节目很有趣，我觉得我们分享了很多实用技巧和搞笑内容。
[00:00:30.900] stories. So if you're ever going to be a plus one for a wedding, definitely check out that episode.
[00:00:30.900] 故事很多。所以，如果你以后要作为伴侣参加婚礼，一定要看看那一集。
[00:00:36.100] But today before we get to our topic, we have a Gen Z word slash phrase to talk about. And
[00:00:36.100] 但今天在进入正题之前，我们要先聊聊一个Z世代的词汇/短语。
[00:00:43.140] this one I actually love because I saw it with my own eyes come to fruition.
[00:00:43.140] 我特别喜欢这个项目，因为我亲眼见证了它从无到有的实现。
[00:00:50.500] I was shocked. I was like, wow, I was here for this part of history.
[00:00:50.500] 我当时震惊了。我心想，哇，我竟然亲历了这段历史。
[00:00:54.340] So the word is actually a phrase. It's I fear. And the way you use it is kind of like a filler word,
[00:00:54.340] 所以这个词实际上是一个短语，就是“我害怕”。而你使用它的方式有点像个填充词。
[00:01:01.700] kind of like how you would use I think you say something and then you end it with I fear. So
[00:01:01.700] 就像你会说“我想你说了什么”，然后最后加上“恐怕”。
[00:01:08.260] usually you try to say something funny and then you end it with I fear. So an example is the video
[00:01:08.260] 通常你会先说些搞笑的话，然后以“恐怕”结尾。例如，视频中就出现了这种情况。
[00:01:15.140] that like really popped off to kick this off. Someone was asking questions about marriage. It
[00:01:15.140] 这件事一开始就闹得沸沸扬扬。有人问了一些关于婚姻的问题。
[00:01:20.420] was like a podcast and someone was asking questions about a marathon. He was like, I know
[00:01:20.420] 就像在听播客，有人问关于马拉松的问题。他回答说，我知道。
[00:01:25.140] nothing about marathons. Are they all the same length? And then the girl was like, yes, they are.
[00:01:25.140] 没提到马拉松。马拉松的长度都一样吗？然后女孩说，是的，都一样。
[00:01:31.540] And he was like, I'm so sorry. I just I don't know anything about this. And she was like, that's
[00:01:31.540] 他当时就说：“对不起，我对此一无所知。” 她接着说：“那是……”
[00:01:35.220] common knowledge. I fear. So the guy in that podcast, his name is Jake Shane, and he has a
[00:01:35.220] 恐怕这是常识。那个播客里的家伙，他叫杰克·肖恩，他有一个
[00:01:43.780] pretty big following on TikTok and him and his followers always use it. And it's so funny to me
[00:01:43.780] 他在TikTok上有很多粉丝，他和他的粉丝经常用这个平台。我觉得这太搞笑了。
[00:01:48.900] because he does like troll dances sometimes. Like you know, TikTok is known for the influencers
[00:01:48.900] 因为他有时候确实喜欢跳恶搞舞。你知道，TikTok 以网红闻名。
[00:01:53.620] doing like a cute dance or whatever. So he'll do that in a troll way. And then the comments will
[00:01:53.620] 他会跳一段可爱的舞蹈之类的。所以他会用一种恶搞的方式去做。然后评论区就会出现各种评论。
[00:01:58.340] always be like, you ate that up I fear. It's so funny. Like it just makes it so ironic. And it's
[00:01:58.340] 总是会说，恐怕你把那句话全吃进去了。太搞笑了。这简直太讽刺了。而且，
[00:02:04.660] kind of like almost formal language. So I feel like it makes it even more funnier on top of that,
[00:02:04.660] 有点像正式语言。所以我觉得这反而让它更有趣了。
[00:02:09.700] too. I'm not gonna lie. I feel like you're just using normal English by saying
[00:02:09.700] 我也一样。说实话，我觉得你只是用很正常的英语说的而已。
[00:02:13.780] it like that. Nothing about this seems like slang or like, different than just using words in their
[00:02:13.780] 就是这样。这听起来不像俚语，或者说，跟正常使用词语没什么区别。
[00:02:20.500] intended method.
[00:02:20.500] 预期方法。
[00:02:22.020] Obby doesn't get it I fear.
[00:02:22.020] 恐怕奥比没明白。
[00:02:25.380] I literally do not.
[00:02:25.380] 我真的没有。
[00:02:29.940] You're just speaking English now? Like, is this even more boomer than Gen Z because you're using
[00:02:29.940] 你现在只会说英语了吗？这难道比Z世代更像婴儿潮一代吗？因为你现在用英语
[00:02:36.740] like formal English like in the ye olde days?
[00:02:36.740] 像以前那种正式的英语？
[00:02:39.700] Well, I feel like slang has to come full circle sometimes. Like we hit peak gibberish at
[00:02:39.700] 我觉得俚语有时候会兜个圈子。就像我们曾经达到过胡言乱语的巅峰时期一样。
[00:02:44.980] skibbity toilet. Now we're circling back to like actual words again. So this is slang that you
[00:02:44.980] 厕所真脏。现在我们又回到真正的词汇上了。所以这是俚语，你
[00:02:52.580] could use at the workplace. So it's a one plus one.
[00:02:52.580] 可以在工作场所使用。所以这是一举两得。
[00:02:58.180] I fear I may be getting fired.
[00:02:58.180] 我担心自己可能会被解雇。
[00:03:01.140] Oh no, you're using it wrong.
[00:03:01.140] 哦不，你用错了。
[00:03:02.580] That's just normal English.
[00:03:02.580] 这只是普通的英语。
[00:03:03.620] Or is it I may be getting fired I fear?
[00:03:03.620] 我担心自己会被解雇吗？
[00:03:07.140] Yeah, okay now it's slang.
[00:03:07.140] 好吧，现在它变成俚语了。
[00:03:12.660] It has to be at the end of your phrase or sentence. You're right. It's like it's not
[00:03:12.660] 它必须位于短语或句子的末尾。你说得对。就好像它不是……
[00:03:18.580] changing anything. Like you kind of get it right away. There's nothing to define. But it's just
[00:03:18.580] 改变任何东西。就像你马上就能明白一样。没有什么需要定义的。但它就是这样。
[00:03:24.500] the phrasing is funny.
[00:03:24.500] 这种措辞很有趣。
[00:03:26.340] I do like the phrase I fear. It makes me feel more proper like I'm Oscar Wilde. It seems
[00:03:26.340] 我确实喜欢“我害怕”这个短语。它让我感觉自己更像奥斯卡·王尔德那样文雅。
[00:03:31.540] like something Oscar Wilde would say.
[00:03:31.540] 就像奥斯卡·王尔德会说的话一样。
[00:03:33.140] I think that's like part of the charm to it. And then also I don't know like before so in
[00:03:33.140] 我觉得这正是它的魅力所在。而且，我也不知道以前是怎么回事，所以……
[00:03:38.420] that clip that I first saw this immediately at the end of the clip, I was like, dude, that
[00:03:38.420] 我第一次看到那个片段的时候，看到结尾就立刻觉得，老兄，这……
[00:03:42.900] was so funny what she said. And I was like, damn, should I try to like put that into my
[00:03:42.900] 她说的话太搞笑了。我当时就想，天哪，我应该试着把这句话写进我的……
[00:03:46.660] vocabulary? And I opened the comments and everyone's like, wow, she ate I fear you know,
[00:03:46.660] 词汇量？然后我打开评论，大家都在说，哇，她吃了，我担心你知道的，
[00:03:51.380] they're like immediately using it. Someone's like, wow, I'm gonna use that like that was
[00:03:51.380] 他们马上就用上了。有人会说，哇，我要像这样用它。
[00:03:54.660] so funny. And I was like, damn, we all have the same brain.
[00:03:54.660] 太搞笑了。我当时就想，天哪，我们所有人的大脑都一样。
[00:03:57.860] I just googled I fear meme and nothing came up. How do I even like search for this?
[00:03:57.860] 我刚在谷歌上搜了“我害怕的表情包”，结果什么都没搜到。我到底该怎么搜这个？
[00:04:06.260] Maybe like I fear TikTok.
[00:04:06.260] 或许就像我害怕TikTok一样。
[00:04:09.140] It's common sense I fear. Is that right? Yeah, that's Oh, I see it. That's like common
[00:04:09.140] 恐怕这是常识。对吧？嗯，就是这样。哦，我明白了。这就像常识一样。
[00:04:15.380] sense. I fear. I feel like I just lost brain cells.
[00:04:15.380] 感觉。我害怕。我觉得自己好像失去了一些脑细胞。
[00:04:30.420] Actually, it replaces I feel like now that I think about it, because the format is like,
[00:04:30.420] 实际上，我觉得它取代了“我觉得现在想想，因为它的形式是这样的”，
[00:04:35.460] I just lost brain cells. I fear Yeah, it's like it replaces I feel like and you put it at the
[00:04:35.460] 我感觉自己好像失去了一些脑细胞。我害怕。是的，感觉就像它取代了……我觉得你把它放在了……
[00:04:41.460] end of the sentence instead of the beginning. I do like the idea of putting it at the end of
[00:04:41.460] 放在句末而不是句首。我确实喜欢把它放在句末的想法。
[00:04:46.180] the sentence that does make it more like, interesting. Makes me feel like I'm better
[00:04:46.180] 这句话确实让它变得更有趣了。让我感觉自己好多了。
[00:04:50.980] at English. Maybe another layer to it is the like, oh, I'm so quirky. I talk quirky.
[00:04:50.980] 英语方面。或许还有另一层含义，比如，哦，我真是太古怪了。我的说话方式也很古怪。
[00:04:59.220] Are we going back to that now? People who still wear suits to school?
[00:04:59.220] 我们现在要回到过去那种时代了吗？人们仍然穿着西装去上学？
[00:05:04.020] Oh, my God. The fedora is back.
[00:05:04.020] 我的天哪，软呢帽又流行回来了。
[00:05:12.260] I kind of like it though. It's a good bit.
[00:05:12.260] 我倒还挺喜欢的。挺不错的。
[00:05:15.060] We should have all gone to private school so we can wear suits to school every day.
[00:05:15.060] 我们都应该去私立学校，这样我们就可以每天穿西装去上学了。
[00:05:19.540] It's a little too late. I fear. I can't stop saying it. It's like too easy to incorporate.
[00:05:19.540] 恐怕有点太晚了。我忍不住一直说。这太容易融入我的日常习惯了。
[00:05:29.460] You don't even have to like say it at the end of your song. You'd like even wait a second.
[00:05:29.460] 你甚至不必在歌曲结尾说这句话。你甚至可以稍等片刻。
[00:05:32.820] Just throw it in. Yeah, if you're late, you're like, I fear.
[00:05:32.820] 直接放进去就行了。是啊，如果你迟到了，你就会想，我真担心。
[00:05:38.980] Let us not forget.
[00:05:38.980] 我们不要忘记。
[00:05:44.180] Well, I'm excited to see how we all drop in our I fears throughout the episode.
[00:05:44.180] 我很期待看到我们大家在这一集中如何倾诉各自的恐惧。
[00:05:49.140] But slaying aside, we do have a pretty funny episode topic today, which is awkward restaurant
[00:05:49.140] 抛开这些不谈，我们今天这期节目的话题相当有趣，那就是尴尬的餐厅。
[00:05:55.860] moments. I think every time you go out to eat at some sort of restaurant, there's something
[00:05:55.860] 时刻。我觉得每次你去餐厅吃饭，都会有那么一些事。
[00:06:01.780] slightly awkward, slightly funny that happens. And I personally just have amassed so many different
[00:06:01.780] 有点尴尬，又有点好笑的事情发生了。而我个人则积累了太多不同的经历。
[00:06:07.060] stories of things like that happening. So I'm kind of excited to dive into our various awkward
[00:06:07.060] 类似的事情发生过，所以我很兴奋能深入探讨我们各种尴尬的经历。
[00:06:12.100] situations together. So let's start by talking a little bit about ordering and awkward moments
[00:06:12.100] 让我们一起探讨各种情况。那么，我们先来聊聊点餐和尴尬时刻吧。
[00:06:18.260] that come up when you order food at a restaurant. Is there anything that kind of comes top of mind
[00:06:18.260] 在餐厅点餐时，你会想到哪些问题？有没有什么问题让你印象深刻？
[00:06:22.580] for you? Immediately, I'm like reciting my order in my head prepping to go up.
[00:06:22.580] 对你来说？我立刻就在脑子里默念我的订单，准备上去。
[00:06:29.780] I feel like that's a common one. For me, I am very indecisive. So what I always do is somehow
[00:06:29.780] 我觉得这很常见。就我而言，我非常优柔寡断。所以我总是会想办法……
[00:06:39.380] with the waiter will like turn to me and be like, what's your order? I'm like, please pick me last
[00:06:39.380] 服务员会转过头来问我：“您要点什么？” 我就会说：“请最后再点我。”
[00:06:42.580] like somehow they always pick me first. Oh, you know what? It's because you're left handed and
[00:06:42.580] 好像他们总是先选我似的。哦，你知道吗？那是因为你是左撇子，而且
[00:06:48.340] you set the edge of the table. Oh, bear. Okay. Also, I feel like the waiter usually asks the
[00:06:48.340] 你把桌子边缘摆好。哦，熊。好的。还有，我觉得服务员通常会问
[00:06:57.060] person who he makes eye contact with, like first slash the person who looks like they're
[00:06:57.060] 他首先会和与他进行眼神交流的人，比如第一个看起来像是……的人
[00:07:02.260] at the head of the table. Obviously, you got to keep your eyes glued to that menu.
[00:07:02.260] 坐在餐桌主位上。显然，你的目光必须紧紧盯着菜单。
[00:07:06.980] Hot tip is dropped. Dude, I'd be studying that menu. I fear.
[00:07:06.980] 有重要消息透露了。兄弟，我得好好研究一下那份菜单。我真担心。
[00:07:17.060] The waiter's probably like, oh, this guy's the tallest. I'll choose him, I fear.
[00:07:17.060] 服务员可能会想，哦，这个人最高。恐怕我会选他。
[00:07:22.420] I'm going to say that was a bad usage of my fear. I feel like it makes me
[00:07:22.420] 我觉得我那样利用恐惧是不对的。我觉得这让我……
[00:07:26.020] not seem like the head of the table.
[00:07:26.020] 看起来不像个主导者。
[00:07:30.340] Okay, I think it also depends though if you're like in a line or at the table. I feel like in
[00:07:30.340] 好吧，我觉得这也要看你是在排队还是在桌边。我觉得在
[00:07:36.020] the line sometimes there's even more pressure because you're like, oh fuck, I'm next. And then,
[00:07:36.020] 有时候排队的时候压力更大，因为你会想，哦，糟了，下一个就是我了。然后，
[00:07:43.540] okay, worst case, sometimes I let people behind me just go in front of me. I'm like,
[00:07:43.540] 好吧，最糟糕的情况是，有时候我会让后面的人直接开到我前面。我就想，
[00:07:47.620] I feel like it depends where I'm at for when I feel nervous about the line. If it's like a
[00:07:47.620] 我觉得这取决于我当时的处境，以及我何时会对排队感到紧张。如果就像……
[00:07:54.020] bodega or like a bagel shop or something, it's like fast paced in there. It's a tense work
[00:07:54.020] 像杂货店或者贝果店之类的，那里的节奏很快。工作氛围很紧张。
[00:07:58.820] environment. So then I'm like, you can just go ahead of me. I'm not ready for this. But if it's
[00:07:58.820] 环境。所以我就想，你可以先走。我还没准备好。但如果是这样的话
[00:08:02.580] like Chipotle and there's a long line building behind me, I don't care.
[00:08:02.580] 就像去Chipotle餐厅一样，即使身后排起了长队，我也不在乎。
[00:08:08.020] That's fair. Chipotle, you can make the decisions in the line.
[00:08:08.020] 这很公平。Chipotle，你可以在排队的时候自己做决定。
[00:08:11.860] I feel like I also match the pace of the employee. So if they're super fast paced,
[00:08:11.860] 我觉得我也能跟上员工的工作节奏。所以如果他们的工作节奏很快，
[00:08:17.860] then I'll be like, oh shit, yeah, I'll take this, this and this. But if they're going slow,
[00:08:17.860] 然后我就会想，哦，糟了，好吧，我要这个、这个和这个。但如果他们进展缓慢，
[00:08:23.540] they're kind of just lollygagging. But I'll lollygag too.
[00:08:23.540] 他们有点儿磨蹭。不过我也要磨蹭一下。
[00:08:26.980] But I think Chipotle is a special case too because it didn't really get big until we were
[00:08:26.980] 但我认为Chipotle也是个特例，因为它直到我们……之后才真正发展壮大。
[00:08:31.700] in middle school. And I think it's like, oh, I'm not ready for this. And then I'm like,
[00:08:31.700] 上初中时，我就想，哦，我还没准备好。然后我就想，
[00:08:37.060] oh, I'm not ready for this. And I think it's a special case too because it didn't really get
[00:08:37.060] 哦，我还没准备好。而且我觉得这事儿也比较特殊，因为它并没有真正发生。
[00:08:39.140] big until we were in middle school. And I remember the first time I went to Chipotle,
[00:08:39.140] 直到我们上中学之前，Chipotle 都很受欢迎。我还记得我第一次去 Chipotle 的情景。
[00:08:44.420] I didn't know there were all these things you have to pick. And the thing too is like,
[00:08:44.420] 我不知道还有这么多东西需要选择。而且还有一点就是，
[00:08:49.940] Chipotle is not as bad about this, but sometimes at poke places or something,
[00:08:49.940] Chipotle在这方面还好一些，但有时在一些卖夏威夷盖饭之类的店里就会出现这种情况。
[00:08:54.660] there's all these rules and restrictions, right? Like you get three proteins, you have five of
[00:08:54.660] 规则和限制真不少，对吧？比如你只能吃三种蛋白质，你有五种……
[00:08:58.260] this, you get this and avocado is $2 extra and like all these random things that you have to
[00:08:58.260] 这个，你就能得到这个，牛油果要额外加2美元，还有所有这些你必须加的零零碎碎的东西。
[00:09:03.300] keep in mind. So then I feel like the first few times it took a lot of getting used to,
[00:09:03.300] 记住这一点。所以我觉得最初几次需要很长时间才能适应，
[00:09:08.100] of like, okay, I need to go in with a plan, one rice, one bean, one meat,
[00:09:08.100] 比如，好吧，我得提前做好计划，一份米饭，一份豆子，一份肉，
[00:09:12.820] because the first time was so like traumatizing.
[00:09:12.820] 因为第一次的经历太令人痛苦了。
[00:09:16.660] Wait, I feel that. I feel like poke place is a very good example for that. When they're like
[00:09:16.660] 等等，我也有这种感觉。我觉得宝可梦乐园就是一个很好的例子。当他们像这样的时候……
[00:09:21.460] five veggies or whatever, I'm like, wait, I just want all of them.
[00:09:21.460] 五种蔬菜什么的，我就想，等等，我全都要。
[00:09:24.740] Or when you're like, there's like different styles of like the sashimi mixed with the sauces and
[00:09:24.740] 或者当你想吃的时候，比如，有各种不同风格的生鱼片，搭配不同的酱汁，
[00:09:30.900] you're like, hold on, I'm trying to like figure out what all of these are even called and like
[00:09:30.900] 你会想，等等，我正在努力弄清楚这些东西都叫什么，然后……
[00:09:35.700] what's in them.
[00:09:35.700] 里面有什么？
[00:09:37.940] Wait, the sauces?
[00:09:37.940] 等等，酱料？
[00:09:39.460] Oh, the sauces at poke places?
[00:09:39.460] 哦，你是说夏威夷盖饭店里的酱料吗？
[00:09:41.300] Oh yeah.
[00:09:41.300] 哦，是的。
[00:09:41.940] Yeah. Dude, they never say what's in them. I'm like, how am I supposed to know what your house
[00:09:41.940] 是啊。兄弟，他们从来不说里面装的是什么。我就想，我怎么知道你家是什么？
[00:09:46.580] sauce is?
[00:09:46.580] 酱汁是什么？
[00:09:47.540] Wait, that's so true. I'm like, okay, house sauce is a gamble, but like usually, you know, maybe
[00:09:47.540] 等等，这说得太对了。我就想，好吧，自制酱料确实有点碰运气，但通常情况下，你知道，也许吧。
[00:09:53.620] like 80% of the time it's good, but it's still a gamble. You have no idea what it is.
[00:09:53.620] 大概80%的情况下都不错，但仍然是一场赌博。你根本不知道结果会怎样。
[00:09:58.500] I would just want them to tell me like, is it like a aioli type of thing or is it like a
[00:09:58.500] 我只想让他们告诉我，它是像蒜泥蛋黄酱那样的东西，还是像……
[00:10:02.980] vinaigrette type? Like, just give me some information.
[00:10:02.980] 是哪种油醋汁？就给我点信息吧。
[00:10:05.940] Like, I don't need to know the flavor profile, but like...
[00:10:05.940] 我不需要知道口味描述，但是……
[00:10:08.340] Yeah, I agree. I'm not like a huge mayo person for like poke, so I'm always like, okay, you know,
[00:10:08.340] 是的，我同意。我不太喜欢在夏威夷盖饭里加蛋黄酱，所以我总是会想，好吧，你知道的，
[00:10:14.340] usually ponzu or something, but you don't know for sure. Sometimes that house sauce is spicy mayo.
[00:10:14.340] 通常是柚子醋之类的，但也不确定。有时候店家特制的酱汁是辣味蛋黄酱。
[00:10:20.740] Yeah, wait.
[00:10:20.740] 等等。
[00:10:22.180] Yeah.
[00:10:22.180] 是的。
[00:10:23.940] But I do agree. Chipotle has a leg up over everyone because I think it's so
[00:10:23.940] 但我同意。Chipotle 比其他所有餐厅都更胜一筹，因为我觉得它……
[00:10:28.340] standardized now. Like a lot of us basically have our orders memorized and then maybe when we're
[00:10:28.340] 现在都标准化了。就像我们很多人基本上都把订单背下来了，然后也许当我们……
[00:10:33.700] there, we can make the split second decision like, oh, do I want to spice it up today and like
[00:10:33.700] 在那里，我们可以瞬间做出决定，比如，哦，我今天想不想来点刺激的？
[00:10:39.060] change something? But for the most part, it's like, I at least stick to my usual order.
[00:10:39.060] 会做出一些改变吗？但大多数情况下，我至少会坚持我通常的订单。
[00:10:44.260] I've been like back on a chipotle grind recently.
[00:10:44.260] 我最近又开始疯狂迷恋Chipotle了。
[00:10:47.460] Nice.
[00:10:47.460] 好的。
[00:10:47.780] And it's interesting to see that like how my order has changed since like high school.
[00:10:47.780] 很有意思的是，我的饮食习惯从高中到现在发生了很大的变化。
[00:10:51.780] Now I can't get like the spicy salsa because it like fucks my stomach up in the middle of it. So
[00:10:51.780] 我现在不能吃辣莎莎酱了，因为它吃到一半我的胃就难受得不行。
[00:10:56.900] it's really sad to be honest.
[00:10:56.900] 说实话，这真的很令人难过。
[00:10:58.900] Wait, I get it on the side sometimes and then I can control, you know, how much I'm mixing
[00:10:58.900] 等等，我有时候会把它放在一边，这样我就可以控制混合的比例了。
[00:11:03.460] and make sure I'm like getting a couple scoops of rice in first to line the stomach.
[00:11:03.460] 而且要确保我先吃几勺米饭垫垫胃。
[00:11:12.340] Oh my god. But I have realized with chipotle, I can't, at least in like the one I go to near
[00:11:12.340] 我的天哪。但我发现，至少在我常去的那家 Chipotle 餐厅，我不能这么做。
[00:11:17.380] my apartment, I can't order like pickup or delivery or like on the app or anything. Like
[00:11:17.380] 在我的公寓里，我不能像点外卖自取或外送那样，也不能通过应用程序或其他任何方式点餐。
[00:11:22.820] I have to see them make it or else they put like nothing in the bowl.
[00:11:22.820] 我必须亲眼看到他们做出来，否则他们碗里就几乎没放什么。
[00:11:25.540] Yeah, that's the worst.
[00:11:25.540] 是啊，那是最糟糕的。
[00:11:27.060] Yeah.
[00:11:27.060] 是的。
[00:11:27.860] I think a funny thing though about going back to ordering in general, there's also
[00:11:27.860] 不过，我觉得关于重新开始订购东西这件事，有一件很有趣的事，那就是……
[00:11:33.300] some funny stuff that happens when you order with a big group. Usually I feel like they either go
[00:11:33.300] 和一大群人一起点餐时会发生一些有趣的事情。通常我觉得他们要么会……
[00:11:39.540] around one by one and take orders and it's like a little bit more casual. But sometimes when you're
[00:11:39.540] 一个接一个地过来点单，气氛比较随意。但有时候当你……
[00:11:44.260] doing family style, I know like one person has to kind of step up to the plate and write
[00:11:44.260] 如果是家庭式聚餐，我知道总得有一个人站出来负责写。
[00:11:49.060] everything down on their like phone notepad and rattle off the order to the waiter. And I'm always
[00:11:49.060] 他们把所有东西都记在手机备忘录里，然后噼里啪啦地把订单告诉服务员。而我总是
[00:11:54.020] kind of interested to see like who does that role in big groups. I'm like damn it's kind of a power
[00:11:54.020] 我很好奇在大团队里谁会扮演这个角色。我心想，哇，这真是一种权力。
[00:11:58.900] move.
[00:11:58.900] 移动。
[00:12:00.180] That's head of the table vibes.
[00:12:00.180] 这气场十足，感觉自己是餐桌上的主宰。
[00:12:01.940] True. Oh my god. I'm thinking about it. I usually never end up with that task, but like I wouldn't
[00:12:01.940] 没错。我的天哪。我正在考虑这件事。我通常不会接到那种任务，但好像我不会接到似的。
[00:12:07.780] mind doing that. But usually someone else just like, you know, steps up and does it. So I'm like,
[00:12:07.780] 我介意做这件事。但通常会有其他人主动去做。所以我就想，
[00:12:13.380] okay, I don't have to do anything.
[00:12:13.380] 好的，我什么都不用做。
[00:12:16.020] Even just coordinating what to order too is already a task. Like I feel like usually that's
[00:12:16.020] 就连协调订餐都成了一项任务。我觉得通常情况下，这都是……
[00:12:20.820] the person who ends up ordering it. The person has the most say or maybe was guiding the
[00:12:20.820] 最终下单的人。这个人最有发言权，或者可能一直在指导决策。
[00:12:26.260] conversation on like guys we should order this.
[00:12:26.260] 对话内容大概是：伙计们，我们应该点这个。
[00:12:29.620] That's true. Oh actually there has been some situations though where maybe like I've been
[00:12:29.620] 没错。哦，其实也有些情况，比如我曾经……
[00:12:35.460] to the restaurant before so I'll kind of take charge of collecting the order. But then you
[00:12:35.460] 我之前去过餐厅，所以我会负责取餐。但是你
[00:12:41.220] know once the order is collected I'll be like, all right you go tell the waiter.
[00:12:41.220] 我知道一旦订单收集完毕，我就会说，好了，你去告诉服务员。
[00:12:45.780] Like the immediate delegation.
[00:12:45.780] 就像直接委派的代表团一样。
[00:12:51.300] Well what if you tell someone to do that and then they just go rogue and change the order?
[00:12:51.300] 如果你让别人这么做，结果他们擅自更改了订单怎么办？
[00:12:55.700] Whoa. That has not happened yet luckily.
[00:12:55.700] 哇。还好，这种情况还没有发生。
[00:12:59.220] Just saying that's a possibility if you're giving that power to someone else.
[00:12:59.220] 我的意思是，如果你把权力交给别人，这种情况就可能发生。
[00:13:02.900] You're right though.
[00:13:02.900] 你说得对。
[00:13:05.460] Now I hope you ask me to order so I can try that.
[00:13:05.460] 现在我希望你能让我点餐，这样我就可以试试了。
[00:13:08.740] I'll keep in mind not to do that.
[00:13:08.740] 我会记住不要那样做。
[00:13:13.780] I think sometimes though there's also a language restriction. So if you go to
[00:13:13.780] 不过我觉得有时候也会有语言限制。所以如果你去
[00:13:18.820] a specific type of restaurant then usually, I don't know if it's even true but I feel like
[00:13:18.820] 通常是某种特定类型的餐厅，我不知道这是否属实，但我感觉是这样。
[00:13:23.860] sometimes we're like oh we feel the pressure to order in that language to get better service
[00:13:23.860] 有时候我们会觉得，为了获得更好的服务，我们不得不使用那种语言点餐。
[00:13:27.940] or something. Or maybe to like impress the wait staff. But I know if we go to like a
[00:13:27.940] 或者别的什么。或者可能是为了给服务员留下好印象。但我知道如果我们去像……
[00:13:32.500] Korean restaurant usually I'll be the one to kind of order the food. And it's a little bit
[00:13:32.500] 通常去韩国餐厅都是我点菜。而且有点
[00:13:36.660] of pressure actually because everyone's just watching you do it. And then afterwards people
[00:13:36.660] 实际上压力很大，因为每个人都在看着你做这件事。然后之后人们
[00:13:40.820] have like commentary about it. I'm like oh god. Whoa wait who has commentary about you're
[00:13:40.820] 好像有人会对此发表评论。我当时就想，我的天哪。等等，谁会对你的评论发表评论？
[00:13:46.580] ordering food for them? I mean nothing like negative right but usually it's like whoa.
[00:13:46.580] 给他们点外卖？我的意思是，这没什么不好的，但通常感觉会很惊讶。
[00:13:53.060] I guess that's the commentary. That's commentary.
[00:13:53.060] 我想这就是评论了。这就是评论。
[00:13:56.420] I fear.
[00:13:56.420] 我感到害怕。
[00:14:00.100] Yeah like I noticed that like Chinese restaurants hear like Katie or Mel whoever will like order
[00:14:00.100] 是啊，我注意到中餐馆经常会听到像凯蒂或梅尔这样的人点餐。
[00:14:04.740] in Chinese. And it's like nice that they do that. But then also sometimes I never know what
[00:14:04.740] 用中文。他们这样做挺好的。但有时候我也不知道他们到底在说什么。
[00:14:10.820] the dishes that we're ordering are because like they're ordering in Chinese. And then I'm like
[00:14:10.820] 我们点的菜是因为他们用中文点餐。然后我就想，
[00:14:14.980] shit like if I like came back without them like I would be starting from square one. Like I have
[00:14:14.980] 如果我没带他们回来，就好像一切都要从头开始。就像我曾经那样。
[00:14:19.140] no idea what. Yeah so even when the food comes out I'm like oh like I know that's like spicy fish or
[00:14:19.140] 完全不知道是什么。是啊，就算菜端上来，我也只会想，哦，我知道那是辣鱼之类的。
[00:14:24.580] like that's like whatever like beef stew or whatever. But like I don't know like the specific
[00:14:24.580] 就像炖牛肉之类的。但我不知道具体是什么。
[00:14:28.020] items on the menu. So then I'm like shit like I can't rebuild this order. That's actually a really
[00:14:28.020] 菜单上的菜品。然后我就想，糟了，我没法重新下单了。这其实挺让人郁闷的。
[00:14:33.380] good point because I don't know about you guys but I feel like in Chinese restaurants sometimes
[00:14:33.380] 说得对，因为我不知道你们怎么想，但我感觉有时候在中餐馆里……
[00:14:40.260] like there's just these standard dishes. So sometimes like people can go in and not even
[00:14:40.260] 就像只有这些标准菜式。所以有时候人们进去之后甚至什么都没有。
[00:14:45.380] look at the menu and just be like hey do you guys make this dish? You know the waiter will be like
[00:14:45.380] 看看菜单，然后直接问：“嘿，你们店里做这道菜吗？” 你知道服务员会说：“
[00:14:50.180] yeah and they'll write it down for you. Like people just like don't even bother searching
[00:14:50.180] 是啊，他们会帮你写下来。有些人甚至懒得去搜索。
[00:14:54.420] the menu you know. They're like okay these are like three of my favorite dishes that are usually
[00:14:54.420] 你知道的，就是菜单。他们会说，好的，这三道菜是我最喜欢的，通常
[00:14:58.100] kind of standard for Chinese restaurants. Do you make them? The menus are just like not even looked
[00:14:58.100] 中餐馆里这算是标配吧。你们自己做吗？菜单看起来就像没看过一样。
[00:15:03.540] at. So I think that can happen for some pretty common things like dim sum. You know like some of these
[00:15:03.540] 所以我觉得这种情况可能会发生在一些很常见的东西上，比如点心。你知道，就像这些
[00:15:09.060] dishes are pretty standardized just like your typical like sit down Chinese restaurant with the
[00:15:09.060] 菜品种类相当标准化，就像你通常在中餐馆里吃到的那种菜一样。
[00:15:15.060] with the circular tables. I don't even know how to like categorize that restaurant as but like
[00:15:15.060] 就是那种圆桌餐厅。我甚至不知道该怎么给那家餐厅归类，但是……
[00:15:19.620] the lazy susan white tablecloth restaurant. Yep yep usually in the morning they're dim sum and then
[00:15:19.620] 那家铺着白色桌布、摆着旋转餐盘的餐厅。没错没错，通常早上他们供应点心，然后……
[00:15:25.540] you know like by the evening they're just like regular Chinese restaurant. Those ones will also
[00:15:25.540] 你知道，到了晚上，它们就跟普通的中国餐馆没什么两样了。那些餐馆也会这样。
[00:15:29.940] have these kinds of like more standardized dishes. So I feel like that is maybe a unique thing to some
[00:15:29.940] 有一些比较标准化的菜肴。所以我觉得这可能对某些人来说是独一无二的。
[00:15:36.580] of these Chinese restaurants but I'm sure if you you know said the English name they would they would
[00:15:36.580] 这些中国餐馆我都见过，但我相信如果你说出它们的英文名字，他们肯定会告诉你。
[00:15:42.500] know. True well I could see it going like oh do you have this spicy fish and he's like yeah we
[00:15:42.500] 我知道。确实，我能想象到那样的情景：哦，你们有辣鱼吗？然后他会说，有啊，我们有。
[00:15:47.780] have like eight of them. That's true. He's like can I get the Chinese identifiers?
[00:15:47.780] 大概有八个。没错。他问我能不能把中文识别码也弄到手。
[00:15:54.020] Even like I'll like cook with Katie sometimes and she'll like get groceries from we and then I'll be
[00:15:54.020] 甚至有时候我会和凯蒂一起做饭，她会从我们这里买食材，然后我就会……
[00:15:59.460] like oh what's like the English name of like this vegetable so I can like go find it at like a
[00:15:59.460] 比如，这种蔬菜的英文名字是什么？这样我才能去那里找到它。
[00:16:03.860] grocery store near me if they have it. She's like uh I don't actually know or even like with stuff
[00:16:03.860] 我附近的杂货店有没有卖。她好像说，呃，我其实不太了解，也不喜欢这些东西。
[00:16:10.260] like like like Indian food that my mom will cook I'll ask her like oh what's like the English name
[00:16:10.260] 比如，像我妈妈做的印度菜，我会问她，哦，它的英文名字是什么？
[00:16:14.260] for this she's like I don't know I can't help you here. I was like dude like how am I supposed to
[00:16:14.260] 为此她就说：“我不知道，我帮不了你。” 我当时就想，老兄，我该怎么做？
[00:16:18.980] rebuild this stuff if there's no translation. Wait that's so true I feel like that is definitely
[00:16:18.980] 如果没有翻译，那就重新做一遍。等等，这话说得太对了，我觉得肯定是这样。
[00:16:24.500] something I've experienced too. Just like pause your look at a dish or something you're like I
[00:16:24.500] 我也有过类似的经历。就像你停下来仔细观察一道菜或什么东西，你会想：
[00:16:28.660] actually have no idea what the fuck the English name is for this.
[00:16:28.660] 我真他妈不知道这玩意儿的英文名字是什么。
[00:16:33.780] This one does not like it only exists in the language my secondary. Yeah it does not transcend
[00:16:33.780] 这个不喜欢它只存在于我的第二语言中。是的，它无法超越。
[00:16:42.260] it does not transcend language. Yeah but another thing about ordering in the language of the
[00:16:42.260] 它并不超越语言。是的，但关于用这种语言进行排序还有另一点需要注意。
[00:16:49.860] restaurant I've started to wonder lately like do we actually get better service when we do that?
[00:16:49.860] 最近我开始思考，在餐厅这样做真的能得到更好的服务吗？
[00:16:56.500] At this point I'm actually thinking that we're just trying to impress the waiters.
[00:16:56.500] 我现在觉得我们其实只是想给服务员留下好印象。
[00:17:01.140] Yeah probably. It's a good way to practice your other language. That's fair too. So my parents
[00:17:01.140] 嗯，大概是吧。这是练习其他语言的好方法。这也没错。所以我的父母
[00:17:07.540] don't live in town anymore and I feel like the only real Korean interaction I get to use my
[00:17:07.540] 我已经不住在城里了，我觉得我唯一能真正接触到的韩国人就是用我的
[00:17:12.820] language is at restaurants and then it's better now because I'm like used to it and my parents
[00:17:12.820] 语言在餐厅里很常见，现在好多了，因为我已经习惯了，而且我的父母也习惯了。
[00:17:18.580] don't live that far anymore but dude the first few years where my parents first moved out of town I
[00:17:18.580] 现在住得没那么远了，但是老兄，我爸妈刚搬出城那几年，我
[00:17:23.860] would go to a Korean restaurant and sometimes feel like almost sad or something like oh my god like
[00:17:23.860] 去韩国餐厅吃饭，有时会感到一丝悲伤，或者像“我的天哪”那样。
[00:17:29.220] mom like every waitress is my mom every waiter is my dad. Oh no. Which is very dramatic because I
[00:17:29.220] 妈妈就像每个女服务员都是我妈妈，每个服务员都是我爸爸。哦不。这太夸张了，因为我
[00:17:36.980] didn't have to really live that far away from them for a long time but still I was like oh my
[00:17:36.980] 其实我并不需要和他们住得那么远，而且住的时间也不长，但我当时还是觉得，哦，我的天哪
[00:17:42.020] god this is my culture my forgotten culture. My adopted family. Oh I see see in that case you're
[00:17:42.020] 天哪，这是我的文化，我被遗忘的文化。我的养父母。哦，我明白了，这么说你是……
[00:17:52.020] speaking Korean to them maybe they felt that connection too they're like hey give my daughter
[00:17:52.020] 跟他们说韩语，也许他们也感受到了那种联系，他们会说：“嘿，把我的女儿还给我。”
[00:17:57.220] out there the best soup today. Yeah she needs to eat. They're probably like why is this girl looking
[00:17:57.220] 今天外面有最好喝的汤。是啊，她需要吃点东西。他们可能在想，这女孩怎么在看
[00:18:03.460] up at me so wistfully?
[00:18:03.460] 如此深情地望着我？
[00:18:08.020] But I think there's definitely some like level of pride or like impressed with yourself you're
[00:18:08.020] 但我认为这里面肯定包含着某种程度的自豪感，或者说是对自己感到满意。
[00:18:13.620] like oh yeah I just ordered that in like Chinese or Korean or like whatever right.
[00:18:13.620] 哦，对，我刚用中文、韩文或者其他什么语言点了那个。
[00:18:18.420] True. Waiters like yeah I got you. I guess it makes you feel more part of that community almost.
[00:18:18.420] 没错。服务员会说“好的，没问题”。我觉得这会让你感觉自己更融入那个社区了。
[00:18:25.380] I remember there was this one time I was in Florence and I was like eating I decided to go
[00:18:25.380] 我记得有一次我在佛罗伦萨，当时我正在吃饭，然后我决定去
[00:18:30.100] to this Indian restaurant with two of my friends. I like did not know what to expect but then like
[00:18:30.100] 我和两个朋友去了这家印度餐厅。我之前不知道会是什么样子，但后来……
[00:18:34.340] the one guy working there he basically came up to us and he was like are you from India? I was like
[00:18:34.340] 那里的那个男员工走过来问我们：“你们是印度人吗？” 我当时就懵了。
[00:18:39.700] no but my parents are. He's like you get a 10 euro discount. Holy shit. Hell yeah.
[00:18:39.700] 不，但我父母有。他说你可以享受10欧元的折扣。我的天！太棒了！
[00:18:47.460] Damn that's hella worth it. And the place is pretty fire yeah. It was really interesting because
[00:18:47.460] 真他妈值！而且那地方确实很棒。真的很有意思，因为
[00:18:51.860] like that restaurant so my parents had gone to Florence like maybe like six months before I was
[00:18:51.860] 就像那家餐厅一样，我父母大概在我去佛罗伦萨前六个月左右去了那里。
[00:18:57.300] there and then they're like oh when you go like you have to try this Indian restaurant. I was like
[00:18:57.300] 然后他们就说，哦，你去的时候一定要去试试这家印度餐厅。我当时就想：
[00:19:02.340] okay like I'm not I'm not gonna go to Florence and like eat Indian food but then it turns out
[00:19:02.340] 好吧，我本来没打算去佛罗伦萨吃印度菜，但后来却……
[00:19:07.540] that restaurant was right across the street from my apartment so it's literally like a 10 second
[00:19:07.540] 那家餐厅就在我公寓对面，真的只有10秒钟的路程。
[00:19:11.140] walk so I was like shit I guess I have to go now and it was actually really good. It paid off.
[00:19:11.140] 走着走着，我就想，糟了，看来我得走了，结果还真不错。一切都值得。
[00:19:17.860] Yeah dividends 10 euros. That's pretty big. Yeah honestly there's nothing like seeing
[00:19:17.860] 是啊，股息10欧元。那可不少。说实话，没有什么比看到……更让人高兴的了。
[00:19:24.900] people from your like family's culture abroad in like Europe especially. Like every time I saw a
[00:19:24.900] 尤其是在欧洲等地，来自你家庭文化背景的人。就像我每次看到……
[00:19:30.580] Korean person I was like whoa squad. Yeah white people. You're like a piece of home. Yeah but um back to the
[00:19:30.580] 我当时就觉得，哇，这群韩国人真棒。是啊，白人。你们就像是家乡的一部分。是啊，但是，嗯，回到正题……
[00:19:38.420] ordering thing I just thought of something like so funny and awkward that I feel like happens a lot
[00:19:38.420] 点餐这件事，我突然想到一件既搞笑又尴尬的事，感觉经常发生。
[00:19:44.020] especially in big groups which is when you ask the waiter for recommendations you know they walk
[00:19:44.020] 尤其是在人多的时候，当你问服务员推荐菜品时，你知道他们会直接走开。
[00:19:51.300] away they're like I'll give you a couple minutes to think about it and you huddle back up with your
[00:19:51.300] 他们走开后会说：“我给你几分钟时间考虑一下。”然后你又缩回身边。
[00:19:55.780] group right and you're like okay yeah basically fuck those recommendations that the waitress just
[00:19:55.780] 小组讨论进行得很顺利，然后你会想，好吧，基本上就是管那些服务员的建议呢。
[00:19:59.940] told us let's just order what we originally said. Yeah that's so awkward like the peak awkward moment
[00:19:59.940] 他们说那就按我们之前说的点吧。是啊，那真是太尴尬了，尴尬到极点。
[00:20:07.780] is when you ask the waiter like oh like what would you recommend and they say something and then like
[00:20:07.780] 就是当你问服务员，比如“哦，你有什么推荐的吗？”，他们说了些什么，然后……
[00:20:12.820] in the same moment you're like yeah no I'm gonna go with this other item like you're just making eye
[00:20:12.820] 就在同一瞬间，你又会说，不，我还是选另一个吧，就好像你在跟我眉目传情似的。
[00:20:17.380] contact with you like have the pause you're like uh interesting I'm gonna go with this other item.
[00:20:17.380] 与你接触时，你会停顿一下，然后你会说，嗯，有意思，我还是选择另一个项目吧。
[00:20:23.220] You're like actually I'm ready to order and it's not that. Yeah thank you for helping me decide what
[00:20:23.220] 你会说，其实我已经准备下单了，不是那个意思。是的，谢谢你帮我决定。
[00:20:29.140] I don't want. I feel that way too when the waiters come to like tell you what the special is and it's
[00:20:29.140] 我不想。服务员过来介绍特色菜的时候，我也有这种感觉。
[00:20:36.180] like before they come and talk to you about the special you probably have your order ready already
[00:20:36.180] 就像在他们来跟你介绍特价菜之前，你可能已经把订单准备好了。
[00:20:40.900] but they still have to go through the speech right so you're just sitting there for like a minute while
[00:20:40.900] 但他们还是得走完整个流程，对吧？所以你得坐在那儿等个一分钟左右。
[00:20:44.020] they're like oh today's special is this the fish of the day the soup of the day blah blah blah you're
[00:20:44.020] 他们会说，哦，今天的特价菜是今日鲜鱼还是今日例汤，等等等等。
[00:20:48.020] like okay thank you I'll have that meatball marinara. Oh are we at Subway right now?
[00:20:48.020] 好的，谢谢，我要一份肉丸番茄酱。哦，我们现在是在赛百味吗？
[00:20:55.460] Sorry it's the first thing I thought of. I don't know why. You're getting the daily specials at Subway.
[00:20:55.460] 抱歉，这是我首先想到的。我也不知道为什么。你买的是赛百味的每日特价餐。
[00:21:02.980] But yeah very relatable. Also sometimes though when they do give these specials or you ask for
[00:21:02.980] 确实很有共鸣。而且有时候，当他们推出这些特价活动或者你提出要求时……
[00:21:08.740] wrecks I feel like kind of pressured to choose at least one thing that they wrecked because I'm
[00:21:08.740] 我觉得我好像有压力，必须至少选出一件他们毁坏的东西，因为我……
[00:21:13.700] like oh my god like you know we asked them they spent their time to list all these foods and like
[00:21:13.700] 我的天哪，你知道，我们问了他们，他们花时间列出了所有这些食物，而且
[00:21:18.740] why they're good. I know we're not we weren't planning on ordering any of these but maybe we
[00:21:18.740] 它们好在哪里？我知道我们本来没打算订购这些东西，但也许我们会。
[00:21:24.180] should just add this one appetizer in. Like you owe them one essentially. Yeah it's like when you go to
[00:21:24.180] 应该加一道开胃菜。感觉就像你欠他们一个人情似的。是啊，就像你去……
[00:21:29.700] like a store and like someone helps you out so much you're like should I have to buy something now?
[00:21:29.700] 就像在商店里，有人给了你很多帮助，让你忍不住想：我现在是不是应该买点什么呢？
[00:21:34.260] Exactly. Pity order. I feel like this could also get really awkward when you ask a sommelier or
[00:21:34.260] 没错。这是出于同情才点的。我觉得如果你问侍酒师，这可能会变得非常尴尬。
[00:21:40.020] just like the waiter or whatever I'm looking for a red wine can you recommend something and then
[00:21:40.020] 就像服务员一样，我想找一款红酒，你能推荐一下吗？
[00:21:44.020] they're like yeah and then their finger goes on the wine list and goes all the way to the bottom
[00:21:44.020] 他们说“是啊”，然后手指就伸到酒单上，一直摸到最底部。
[00:21:47.620] to the most expensive bottles I'm like I'm not gonna f*****g drop this much money. What do I look
[00:21:47.620] 看到最贵的酒，我就想：我才不会花这么多钱呢。我该怎么形容我？
[00:21:53.620] like to you? Yeah I'm like do I look rich to you? Like I'm pretty sure I look really poor.
[00:21:53.620] 你觉得呢？嗯，我就想，你觉得我看起来很有钱吗？我感觉自己看起来很穷。
[00:21:58.900] Like I'm gonna need to move your finger up all the way up to the list.
[00:21:58.900] 就好像我需要把你的手指一直移到列表的最上面一样。
[00:22:04.340] And it's just like oh shoot I definitely shouldn't have asked for that rec because
[00:22:04.340] 然后我就想，糟了，我真不该要那份推荐信，因为
[00:22:08.420] they chose maybe like some outrageously expensive three to five hundred dollar
[00:22:08.420] 他们可能选择了价格高得离谱的三到五百美元的商品。
[00:22:12.900] bottle of wine and then you're like okay I'm ready to order I'll take this like fifty dollar
[00:22:12.900] 一瓶酒，然后你就想，好了，我准备点餐了，我要这个，大概五十美元。
[00:22:17.780] bottle of wine. I'll take the second cheapest thing on the list. The move to like that I feel
[00:22:17.780] 一瓶葡萄酒。我要清单上第二便宜的。我喜欢这种感觉。
[00:22:24.180] like works well to get around that and prevent awkwardness for all parties is to just like
[00:22:24.180] 避免这种情况并防止各方尴尬的最好方法就是点赞。
[00:22:28.980] shortlist a couple ones that you're interested in. So like pick two or three be like oh like
[00:22:28.980] 筛选出几个你感兴趣的。比如选两三个，就像……哦，比如
[00:22:32.660] between these what would you recommend whatever you like or whatever you're eating. That's actually
[00:22:32.660] 在这两者之间，你会推荐哪个？不管你喜欢什么或者你正在吃什么。这其实是……
[00:22:36.420] a good strat with the meatball marinara. And then they go to the bottom of the menu and they're
[00:22:36.420] 肉丸配番茄酱是个不错的策略。然后他们翻到菜单最底部，发现……
[00:22:39.620] like how about this one? Oh no! They're like those are great but like I have this other one you
[00:22:39.620] 比如这个怎么样？哦不！他们会说这些都很好，但是我还有另一个你
[00:22:45.940] should see. What about this 2012 reserve? Yeah. We have something in the back room that would be
[00:22:45.940] 应该看看。那2012年的储备酒怎么样？嗯。我们仓库里还有点东西，应该可以……
[00:22:52.820] perfect. Oh my god yeah. I have seen sometimes psalms will ask do you have a price range which
[00:22:52.820] 完美。哦，我的天哪，是的。我有时看到卖家会问你是否有价格范围，
[00:23:00.900] I'm like oh thank god because I totally forgot I should have mentioned I have a price range.
[00:23:00.900] 我当时就想，哦，谢天谢地，因为我完全忘了我应该提一下我的预算范围。
[00:23:05.140] But you know sometimes they don't and you end up with that like 500 dollar rec and you're like oh
[00:23:05.140] 但你知道，有时候他们不会这么做，结果你就得花500美元买个推荐信，然后你就想，哦
[00:23:12.660] thanks but no thanks. Tonight's not that special. Yeah. I feel like if it's like a actual psalm I
[00:23:12.660] 谢谢，不过不用了。今晚没什么特别的。是啊。我觉得如果像一首真正的诗篇那样……
[00:23:20.420] guess and not just like a waiter I feel like they're pretty good about asking like what price
[00:23:20.420] 我觉得他们问价的时候挺耐心的，不像服务员那样只会问价格。
[00:23:24.660] range and stuff that you're looking for but I feel like sometimes waiters are just like oh have you
[00:23:24.660] 种类和你想要的东西，但我觉得有时候服务员只会问：“哦，你有吗？”
[00:23:29.620] considered. There was one time recently where I asked for a rec because it was like a nicer dinner
[00:23:29.620] 考虑过了。最近有一次，我问别人有没有推荐，因为那家餐厅比较高档。
[00:23:36.260] there wasn't an official wine pairing so I was like oh shoot now we have to look through this
[00:23:36.260] 因为没有官方的葡萄酒搭配建议，所以我就想，糟了，现在我们得自己找找了。
[00:23:41.220] like giant book of wine and choose something and I was like okay you know hopefully the psalm can
[00:23:41.220] 就像翻阅一本巨大的葡萄酒书籍，然后从中挑选一种，我就想，好吧，希望这首诗篇能……
[00:23:46.100] narrow it down for us. So I asked and then you know the psalm starts flipping open the book and
[00:23:46.100] 帮我们缩小范围。所以我问了，然后你知道，诗篇开始翻开书卷，
[00:23:51.700] like more and more pages are getting flipped and I'm like oh oh no like I fucked up basically right
[00:23:51.700] 就像越来越多的书页被翻动，我心想“哦哦不，我搞砸了”，基本上就是这样。
[00:23:58.580] and I was praying in my mind as his fingers moving in slow motion I'm like please don't
[00:23:58.580] 我默默祈祷着，看着他的手指缓慢地移动，心想：求求你，不要这样。
[00:24:02.900] choose the most expensive bottle and then first one he chooses like a relatively expensive bottle
[00:24:02.900] 先选最贵的那瓶，然后他选的第一瓶也是相对贵的那瓶。
[00:24:09.140] but then second one he actually chooses one that I was thinking about in my mind and I was like oh
[00:24:09.140] 但第二个问题，他居然选了一个我心里一直在想的，我当时就想：哦
[00:24:13.940] my god yes like thank you so much like now I can choose one of those good yeah I was like now I
[00:24:13.940] 我的天啊，真的非常感谢！现在我可以从中选择一个好的了，是的，我当时就想，现在我
[00:24:19.940] could choose one of their recs within my price range and it's been validated by the psalm.
[00:24:19.940] 我可以从他们的推荐中选择一本符合我预算范围的书，而且这本诗篇也验证了这一点。
[00:24:26.900] Yeah dude that book of wine is so intimidating I mean Crystal you actually know stuff about wine
[00:24:26.900] 是啊，老兄，那本葡萄酒书看起来太吓人了。我的意思是，克里斯托，你其实很懂葡萄酒。
[00:24:32.420] but I feel like for me and James the vocabulary that we use to describe our wine is so limited
[00:24:32.420] 但我感觉我和詹姆斯用来描述我们葡萄酒的词汇量非常有限。
[00:24:39.300] it's literally like hmm this is smooth this is sweet this is dry this is acidic and that's like
[00:24:39.300] 感觉就像，嗯，这个口感顺滑，这个口感甜美，这个口感干爽，这个口感酸爽，就是这样。
[00:24:45.380] it so then when they're like oh what kind of wine do you like I'm like I don't know what kind of wine
[00:24:45.380] 所以当他们问我“你喜欢哪种葡萄酒”的时候，我就说“我不知道你喜欢哪种葡萄酒”。
[00:24:49.620] should I like? I don't know what do you think? Dude next time you should just be like I like good wine
[00:24:49.620] 我该喜欢吗？我不知道，你怎么看？哥们，下次你直接说“我喜欢好酒”就行了。
[00:24:59.060] I like smooth wine. But I think usually if you ask that first you can start off with like do you
[00:24:59.060] 我喜欢口感柔和的葡萄酒。但我觉得通常情况下，如果你先问这个问题，你可以先问“你……”
[00:25:05.700] prefer white or red and then from there you can go for like just throw in some random fruit notes
[00:25:05.700] 先选白葡萄酒或红葡萄酒，然后你可以随意添加一些水果香调。
[00:25:12.020] or you could be like I like fruity wine or you could be like I like more like minerally wine
[00:25:12.020] 或者你可以说我喜欢果味葡萄酒，或者你可以说我更喜欢矿物质味葡萄酒。
[00:25:18.820] yeah that's already too many words for me I'm maxed out on my vocabulary. I see identify mineral flavor
[00:25:18.820] 是的，对我来说已经太多词了，我的词汇量已经用完了。我看到“识别矿物风味”这个词了。
[00:25:26.180] okay actually if you if you like fruity wine then you could say that you'd be like oh I like wine
[00:25:26.180] 其实，如果你喜欢果味葡萄酒，你可以说，你会说，哦，我喜欢葡萄酒。
[00:25:31.780] with more like fruity notes they'll get it and they'll be like okay it'll usually end up tasting
[00:25:31.780] 如果带有更多果香，他们就能接受，然后会觉得“好吧”，通常尝起来会是这个味道。
[00:25:37.060] like maybe a little more juicy almost if even if it's not like full-on sweet anyway I'll give you
[00:25:37.060] 可能稍微多汁一点，就算不是特别甜，我也会给你。
[00:25:44.100] guys a wine lesson later. I will say sometimes I do something mildly egregious and I did this more
[00:25:44.100] 各位，稍后我会给你们上一堂葡萄酒课。我得说，有时候我会做一些略微过分的事，而这次我做得更过分。
[00:25:51.780] like overseas and stuff or sometimes at like nicer restaurants but I have this app called Vivino
[00:25:51.780] 比如在国外之类的，或者有时候在一些比较好的餐厅，我用的是一个叫 Vivino 的应用程序。
[00:25:57.300] and it's like a wine rating app right so akin to how you would look up a restaurant and be like oh
[00:25:57.300] 它就像一个葡萄酒评分应用，对吧？就像你查一家餐厅，然后说“哦”一样。
[00:26:02.260] what's the you know top foods at this place I sometimes search like a couple of the wines on
[00:26:02.260] 你知道，这个地方最受欢迎的食物是什么？我有时候也会搜索一下这里的一些葡萄酒。
[00:26:07.300] the list and pick the highest rated one and it actually kind of works in a pinch but it's just
[00:26:07.300] 从列表中选择评分最高的，应急的时候确实有点用，但这只是……
[00:26:12.500] mildly embarrassing to have like Vivino and like type in the grape name. The waiter sees you like
[00:26:12.500] 用 Vivino 点酒，还要输入葡萄品种名，有点尴尬。服务员看到你这样说。
[00:26:19.220] using your phone under the table. The song comes by do you have any questions? Nah I'm good
[00:26:19.220] 你在桌子底下玩手机。歌响了，你有什么问题吗？没事了。
[00:26:24.420] You're like no Google's helping me. I do that too sometimes actually I'll like look up some because
[00:26:24.420] 你就像在说“谷歌帮不了我”。其实我有时候也会这么做，我会查一些东西，因为……
[00:26:32.580] you know sometimes these wines are like maybe the same wine but different years or they're just like
[00:26:32.580] 你知道，有时候这些酒可能是同一种酒，但年份不同，或者它们就是……
[00:26:38.020] really similar and I'm like okay realistically like what is the difference here I don't know
[00:26:38.020] 真的很相似，我就想，好吧，说实话，它们之间到底有什么区别？我不知道。
[00:26:42.180] like the paper can only tell me so much. Right. Wait I have a question have you guys picked a
[00:26:42.180] 就像这份文件只能告诉我这么多。对。等等，我有个问题，你们选好了吗？
[00:26:47.220] wine and then you know they give you like the little taste tester have you ever been like no
[00:26:47.220] 葡萄酒，然后他们会给你一个小小的品尝器，你有没有过这种感觉，就像“没有”一样？
[00:26:51.140] I don't like this oh and got something else no I'm too embarrassed because I personally have never
[00:26:51.140] 我不喜欢这个，哦，还有别的，不，我太尴尬了，因为我个人从来没有过
[00:26:55.860] yeah I'd be like oh yeah this is phenomenal great choice. Wait actually speaking of that a funny
[00:26:55.860] 是啊，我会说，哦耶，这太棒了，真是个好选择。等等，说起来，这真有点搞笑。
[00:27:02.100] thing happened so yesterday Jisoo and I and like some of our girlfriends we went up to Napa
[00:27:02.100] 昨天发生了一件事，所以我和Jisoo还有几个闺蜜一起去了纳帕。
[00:27:08.740] and Melissa was with us and Melissa's also like kind of into wine at our lunch spot we ordered
[00:27:08.740] 梅丽莎和我们在一起，她也挺喜欢葡萄酒的。我们午餐去的那家店，我们点了酒。
[00:27:15.700] a bottle and someone you know the waiter pours a little taste and I was like oh Mel should taste
[00:27:15.700] 一瓶酒，服务员给你倒了一点尝尝，我当时就想，哦，梅尔应该尝尝。
[00:27:20.340] this one. Mel tasted it and she's like thumbs up to the waiter right waiter starts pouring them all
[00:27:20.340] 这个。梅尔尝了一口，然后对服务员竖起了大拇指，服务员就开始倒酒了。
[00:27:25.620] he leaves and then she was like oh actually I don't know if I like this wine and I was like
[00:27:25.620] 他走了之后，她就说：“哦，其实我不知道我喜不喜欢这款酒。” 我当时就想：
[00:27:33.220] perhaps the time to speak up was earlier. And she was like yeah and she was like I mean like you know
[00:27:33.220] 或许她应该更早开口。她当时就说：“是啊，我的意思是，你知道的。”
[00:27:40.660] it's still it's still enjoyable like we like I can drink it everything but it's like not my favorite
[00:27:40.660] 它仍然很好喝，就像我们喜欢的那样，我可以喝它，但它不是我最喜欢的。
[00:27:45.380] one like we could have maybe gotten a better one for like the same price she was just like but you
[00:27:45.380] 她当时说，我们或许可以用同样的价格买到更好的，但她却说，但是你……
[00:27:50.180] know the guy already uncorked it like I felt bad. I feel like if anyone was to to speak up about
[00:27:50.180] 我知道那家伙已经把酒打开了，我感觉很愧疚。我觉得如果有人要站出来说话……
[00:27:57.540] I don't actually like this one Mel would be the right candidate yeah but actually when people do
[00:27:57.540] 我其实不太喜欢这个，梅尔确实是合适的人选，但实际上当人们……
[00:28:03.700] that like they give you a little taste it's more to make sure that the wine didn't go bad in the
[00:28:03.700] 就像他们给你一点尝尝一样，主要是为了确保葡萄酒没有变质。
[00:28:09.140] bottle so if you're tasting you're like oh this is like weird this is funky I don't think it's supposed
[00:28:09.140] 所以如果你尝一尝，你会觉得“哦，这味道好奇怪，有点怪，我觉得它不应该是这样的”。
[00:28:13.060] to taste like this then you tell them and then they'll be like oh so sorry and they'll get you
[00:28:13.060] 如果你尝起来是这种味道，然后你告诉他们，他们就会说“哦，真抱歉”，然后他们就会抓住你。
[00:28:17.460] like a new bottle of the same wine though yeah so it's not like an ice cream sample yeah
[00:28:17.460] 就像一瓶新买的同款葡萄酒，所以它不像冰淇淋样品。
[00:28:24.740] I think like technically you can be like oh I don't like this wine can we get a different one
[00:28:24.740] 我觉得理论上你可以说，哦，我不喜欢这款酒，我们能换一款吗？
[00:28:29.940] but I guess kind of out of like respect people try not to do that it's like I made the choice bad
[00:28:29.940] 但我想，出于尊重，人们尽量不那样做，就好像我做出了错误的选择。
[00:28:36.260] manners yeah a little bit especially if they like you know open the bottle for you brand new and
[00:28:36.260] 礼貌方面，嗯，有点儿，特别是如果他们像你懂的，为你打开新酒瓶的话。
[00:28:42.420] it's like a bottle only wine not like a wine by the glass so I think like usually people try not
[00:28:42.420] 这就像是整瓶的葡萄酒，而不是按杯卖的，所以我认为通常人们会尽量避免这种情况。
[00:28:49.060] to do that but I think technically you can't and the waiters are not gonna be like no you can't
[00:28:49.060] 这样做是不行的，但我觉得技术上讲你不能这么做，服务员也不会说“不行”。
[00:28:56.180] get a new bottle you know you'll just be banned from the restaurant after this I hate being the
[00:28:56.180] 换个新瓶子吧，你知道你之后肯定会被餐厅拉黑的。我讨厌这样。
[00:29:01.780] one to do that little wine tasting though because I know it's supposed to be a mechanism for us as
[00:29:01.780] 不过，我还是会去参加那个小小的品酒会，因为我知道这应该是我们之间的一种机制。
[00:29:07.220] a consumer to be able to taste the wine but I still feel like I'm obligated to give some sort
[00:29:07.220] 消费者当然可以品尝葡萄酒，但我仍然觉得我有义务给出一些评价。
[00:29:11.940] of performance or something where I like do the swirl no idea what I'm fucking doing
[00:29:11.940] 表演之类的，或者做些我喜欢的那种旋转动作，完全不知道自己在干什么。
[00:29:15.620] I smell it I drink it I'm like exquisite
[00:29:15.620] 我闻到它，我喝到它，我感觉棒极了。
[00:29:24.100] and because you did all that the waiter is now like oh she knows wine yeah
[00:29:24.100] 因为你做了这一切，服务员现在会说，哦，她懂酒，是的。
[00:29:29.940] I'm like I hope he wasn't able to tell that I don't know anything about wine
[00:29:29.940] 我心想，希望他没看出我对葡萄酒一窍不通。
[00:29:34.500] I love a good performative dance
[00:29:34.500] 我喜欢精彩的表演舞蹈
[00:29:38.100] dude I feel like a lot of things at restaurants are performative because
[00:29:38.100] 老兄，我觉得餐厅里很多事情都像是在做作，因为
[00:29:40.980] this kind of ties back to like speaking the language of the you know the waiters and wait
[00:29:40.980] 这有点像是在和服务员交流，你知道，就是那种“等待”的交流方式。
[00:29:45.780] staff it's kind of performative right you're like hey I'm one of you guys like be impressed with me
[00:29:45.780] 员工们，这有点像是在表演，对吧？你会想，嘿，我也是你们中的一员，希望你们对我刮目相看。
[00:29:50.900] please so true yeah just want special treatment yeah something about being out there and hey look
[00:29:50.900] 没错，确实如此，就是想要特殊待遇，是啊，想体验一下那种感觉，嘿，瞧！
[00:29:58.820] at how I'm eating this food aren't I so great yeah oh my god actually earlier this year James and I
[00:29:58.820] 我吃东西的样子真棒，是不是很棒？哦，天哪，其实今年早些时候，我和詹姆斯
[00:30:06.900] went to New York and there's a lot of really nice restaurants in New York right so I remember we
[00:30:06.900] 我去过纽约，纽约有很多非常棒的餐厅，对吧？所以我记得我们
[00:30:11.380] went to eat at this one place that service at that place was really nice like the waiters would
[00:30:11.380] 我去了一家餐厅吃饭，那里的服务真的很好，服务员都很棒。
[00:30:15.620] always come and talk to you after they cleared out each dish of like the course menu essentially
[00:30:15.620] 他们总是会在每道菜都上完后过来和你聊天，就像套餐菜单上的其他菜一样。
[00:30:20.580] but it got to the point where after every single dish we were eating they were like oh how was it
[00:30:20.580] 但后来发展到每道菜吃完后，他们都会问：“味道怎么样？”
[00:30:25.780] the first few times I was like oh so good like whatever and then after like the fifth time I
[00:30:25.780] 头几次我觉得还不错，就那样吧，然后大概第五次之后……
[00:30:29.780] was like am I supposed to be thinking of new things to say or like how are other tables doing it
[00:30:29.780] 我当时想的是，我应该想些新的话要说，还是应该想想其他桌是怎么做的？
[00:30:35.140] because I'm just sitting here like it's good it's good like a fucking it was good robot and I was
[00:30:35.140] 因为我就坐在这里，感觉真好，真好，就像一个他妈的好机器人，而我
[00:30:40.100] like is this boring for the waiter you know so then eventually I tried to be like oh I love that
[00:30:40.100] 比如，服务员会不会觉得无聊？你知道的。所以最后我试着说，哦，我喜欢这样。
[00:30:46.180] the fish was soft and like try to think of all these things and then I was like why am I doing
[00:30:46.180] 鱼肉很嫩，我试着去想所有这些事情，然后我就想，我为什么要这么做？
[00:30:51.300] all this like extra labor and like getting anxious when they walk up and shit oh my god your meal
[00:30:51.300] 这一切都像是额外的劳动，就像他们走过来时你会感到焦虑，哦我的天哪，你的饭菜
[00:30:57.940] became a brain exercise a pop quiz exactly like how many vocabulary words do you have for good
[00:30:57.940] 变成了一项脑力锻炼，一个类似“你掌握多少词汇量”的随堂测验。
[00:31:08.020] I know it was like good for like half the courses oh my god but then I started listening in on other
[00:31:08.020] 我知道它对大约一半的课程来说都挺好的，我的天哪，但后来我开始旁听其他课程。
[00:31:12.500] tables and seeing what they said and then I like took inspo from there but honestly this is a lot
[00:31:12.500] 我看了表格，看了看他们说了什么，然后就从中汲取了灵感，但说实话，这真的很多。
[00:31:17.700] of work to do over a meal would not recommend you started copying other people's homework
[00:31:17.700] 吃饭时要做作业，并不建议你抄袭别人的作业。
[00:31:23.940] you're cheating on the test
[00:31:23.940] 你考试作弊了
[00:31:29.060] wait I'm not gonna lie when when that happens to me I'm literally a broken record I'm like so good
[00:31:29.060] 等等，说实话，当这种情况发生在我身上时，我简直就像个复读机，我感觉太棒了。
[00:31:35.140] so good so good by the end I'm like they should know I'm about to say so good
[00:31:35.140] 太好了，太好了，到最后我都想，他们应该知道我要说太好了。
[00:31:42.340] I feel like I've noticed when the waiter asked me like what I think I if I say like oh yeah like
[00:31:42.340] 我感觉我注意到，当服务员问我“你觉得怎么样？”的时候，如果我说“哦，是的”，就好像……
[00:31:47.540] that was really good then that probably means it was like fine but if I actually like use other
[00:31:47.540] 那真的很好，那可能意味着它还不错，但如果我真的喜欢用其他方式的话。
[00:31:51.860] adjectives or descriptors then like then that was like oh it was really good like when I like put in
[00:31:51.860] 然后形容词或描述词，比如，然后就像，哦，真的很好，就像当我放进去的时候
[00:31:57.540] the thought to like think of why it was good that's how I know I really liked it yeah but if it was
[00:31:57.540] 思考它好在哪里，我就知道我真的很喜欢它。但如果它是
[00:32:02.100] just whatever then I'll be like yeah that was good that's true I see I see okay one thing that I've
[00:32:02.100] 随便吧，然后我就会说，嗯，那很好，确实如此，我明白了，我明白了，好的，有一件事我……
[00:32:06.820] started incorporating a little more is when they ask and I had like a dish that I legitimately
[00:32:06.820] 当他们问起的时候，我开始稍微多做一些，然后我就做了一道菜，我真的……
[00:32:12.980] think was maybe the best of the meal I'll say that I'll be like oh my god this one was so good I
[00:32:12.980] 我觉得这可能是整顿饭里最好吃的一道菜了，我会说，哦我的天哪，这道菜太好吃了！
[00:32:17.220] think it might be my favorite so far the waiters get excited they're like oh my god me too like
[00:32:17.220] 我觉得这可能是我目前为止最喜欢的，服务员们都很兴奋，他们会说“我的天哪，我也是！”
[00:32:21.460] that's my favorite dish I'm like nice A+. What if every dish gets better and better though what if
[00:32:21.460] 那是我最喜欢的菜，我简直要给它打A+。可是如果每道菜都越来越好吃呢？
[00:32:29.460] after every course like oh this is the best dish
[00:32:29.460] 每道菜上完后都赞叹道：“哦，这道菜太棒了！”
[00:32:32.820] he's like again really
[00:32:32.820] 他又来了，真的
[00:32:36.580] how generic well um luckily that hasn't happened yet but I'll let you know if it does
[00:32:36.580] 有多普遍？嗯，幸运的是，这种情况还没有发生，但如果发生了我会通知你。
[00:32:44.900] what I find crazy though I feel like there's people like us where we kind of give the generic answer
[00:32:44.900] 不过我觉得很奇怪的是，我觉得有些人和我们一样，只会给出千篇一律的答案。
[00:32:49.220] and then maybe like spice up a couple of the really good ones but there's also people who like
[00:32:49.220] 然后或许可以给几首很棒的歌加点料，但也有人喜欢
[00:32:54.180] engage a lot with the wait staff or like with the chefs or the salms or whatever so recently I was
[00:32:54.180] 最近我经常和侍应生、厨师、侍者或其他什么人互动。
[00:33:00.980] at this restaurant and we kind of were seated at private tables but there weren't that many so you
[00:33:00.980] 在这家餐厅，我们被安排在私人包厢里，但包厢不多，所以……
[00:33:05.220] can definitely hear what other people were saying right we had some sort of like duck course and
[00:33:05.220] 我能清楚地听到其他人在说什么，对吧？我们当时好像在进行某种类似鸭子训练的课程。
[00:33:10.020] then the waiter came by and was like clearing our plates saying like oh how was it me and james were
[00:33:10.020] 然后服务员过来收拾我们的盘子，问我们感觉怎么样，我和詹姆斯当时
[00:33:14.260] like oh so good blah blah he moves on to the next table he's like how was it and the guy was like
[00:33:14.260] 就像，哦，太好了，等等等等，然后他走到下一桌，问那人感觉怎么样，那人说：
[00:33:19.620] it was really salty oh my god I was like oh my god what the fuck and I'm like ear is open listening
[00:33:19.620] 真的好咸啊，我的天哪，我当时就想，我的天哪，这他妈什么鬼？然后我就竖起耳朵仔细听。
[00:33:25.300] to this conversation and the waiter was like oh I'm sorry like just yours or you know your partners
[00:33:25.300] 这段对话进行到一半，服务员说：“哦，对不起，好像只是你的，或者你知道，你的伴侣的。”
[00:33:30.740] as well like the other person at the table he was like yeah both of ours and this was like a slightly
[00:33:30.740] 就像桌上的其他人一样，他也说，是啊，我们俩的，这感觉有点……
[00:33:36.020] nicer restaurant so then I feel like when you're paying a lot of money you are kind of more entitled
[00:33:36.020] 高档餐厅，所以我觉得当你花了很多钱的时候，你就会觉得自己更有优越感。
[00:33:41.700] to share these opinions and like feedback back but I was like wow like I don't think I would ever
[00:33:41.700] 分享这些观点并获得反馈，但我当时想，哇，我觉得我永远都不会这么做。
[00:33:47.620] say something like that you know dude I don't have the gull
[00:33:47.620] 说些类似的话吧，你知道，伙计，我没有那种胆量。
[00:33:52.260] I don't think I would do it depends like how not edible it is okay that's because I remember there
[00:33:52.260] 我觉得我不会这么做，这取决于它到底有多不能吃。好吧，那是因为我记得有
[00:33:58.100] was like one time we got like some seafood pasta type of thing and it was like really salty and I
[00:33:58.100] 有一次我们点了一份海鲜意面之类的东西，结果特别咸，我
[00:34:03.860] was like after a couple bites like okay like this like you can't even like power through this so
[00:34:03.860] 就像吃了两口之后，就觉得“好吧，就这样吧，你根本没法硬着头皮吃完”。
[00:34:07.220] then we told the waiter he's like oh I'm so sorry there's nothing we can do for you oh that's how it
[00:34:07.220] 然后我们告诉了服务员，他说：“哦，真抱歉，我们帮不了你们。”哦，原来是这样。
[00:34:12.740] tastes I was like uh would not recommend ordering that dish
[00:34:12.740] 尝过之后，我觉得这道菜不太推荐点。
[00:34:19.700] he was like I'm sorry you feel that way that's how it's supposed to taste
[00:34:19.700] 他当时说：“很抱歉你这么觉得，但它本来就应该是这个味道。”
[00:34:25.940] he puts you back into your place that's all right then I mean I think it makes sense though because
[00:34:25.940] 他让你认清自己的位置，那也没什么不好，我的意思是，我觉得这很合理，因为
[00:34:31.380] it's like we all understand that like working in a restaurant is hard you know making this food
[00:34:31.380] 我们都明白，在餐厅工作很辛苦，你知道，做这些食物很不容易。
[00:34:37.700] and prepping and like serving on these people is very tiring so I feel like every time you know we
[00:34:37.700] 准备和为这些人服务真的很累，所以我觉得每次你知道我们
[00:34:42.820] have something to nitpick it's like oh my god like I don't want to put even more work on their plate
[00:34:42.820] 如果有什么地方可以挑剔，那就太好了，我真不想给他们增加更多工作量。
[00:34:48.820] but I guess at some certain points it's like okay actually this needs to be like something
[00:34:48.820] 但我觉得在某些时候，你会想，好吧，实际上这需要变成某种样子。
[00:34:54.420] needs to be said here so it's like finding that balance of like when the correct time to like
[00:34:54.420] 这里需要说明一下，所以关键在于找到合适的平衡点，也就是何时表达喜欢。
[00:35:00.100] cross the line is yeah maybe the the right move is to think of some like ways to say you don't
[00:35:00.100] 越界或许是不对的，正确的做法可能是想出一些方法来表达你不同意。
[00:35:06.340] like the food without being mean and just have them in your back pocket ready to go maybe you'd
[00:35:06.340] 就像喜欢吃东西一样，但不要吝啬，把它们放在口袋里随时准备着，也许你会……
[00:35:12.180] be like oh it's a little salty for me is there anything I can add to change do you have a cup
[00:35:12.180] 比如，我会说：“哦，对我来说有点咸，我可以加点什么调一下吗？你有杯子吗？”
[00:35:17.060] of water I could pour into this dish so that's less salty I can dilute
[00:35:17.060] 我可以往这个盘子里倒些水，这样咸度就低一些，可以稀释一下。
[00:35:24.500] do you have a stove I can use so I can cook the rest of this
[00:35:24.500] 你有炉子可以借我用吗？我想把剩下的菜做完。
[00:35:27.540] I guess for me if there's like shit in the food I'll say something you know like the plastic wrap
[00:35:27.540] 我想，如果食物里有脏东西，比如保鲜膜之类的，我肯定会说出来。
[00:35:37.140] I don't know like a dead fly or something right oh or yeah like a plastic wrap or you know something
[00:35:37.140] 我不知道，就像死苍蝇之类的，或者像保鲜膜之类的，你知道的。
[00:35:42.020] that's like you're like okay this needs to like get out of the food I'll probably try my best
[00:35:42.020] 这就好比你心想，好吧，这东西得从食物里弄出来，我会尽力而为。
[00:35:47.220] to say something yeah I feel like that that's a fair one to bring up no no harm no foul yeah I
[00:35:47.220] 我觉得这么说挺合理的，提一下也无妨，没什么大不了的。
[00:35:52.900] guess because that one feels less bad because you're like oh it's not that the food is bad it's
[00:35:52.900] 猜是因为那样感觉没那么糟糕，你会想，哦，不是食物难吃，而是……
[00:35:56.580] just that like some random shit has fallen here that like I don't think it's supposed to be in
[00:35:56.580] 就好像有些乱七八糟的东西掉在这里了，我觉得它不应该在这里。
[00:36:00.740] here player three has entered the food exactly oh I thought of another like kind of awkward
[00:36:00.740] 三号玩家已经进入食物区了，哦，我又想到一个有点尴尬的场景。
[00:36:07.380] silly situation it goes back to you know ordering the food do you ever kind of like scope out the
[00:36:07.380] 真是个荒唐的情况，你知道，就像点餐一样，你有没有试过先看看菜单？
[00:36:14.180] tables around you and be like oh that looks really good like maybe we should order that
[00:36:14.180] 看看周围的桌子，然后说：“哦，那看起来真不错，也许我们也应该点那道菜。”
[00:36:19.220] you're like flipping in the menu to try to find a photo of what that could be or you're like take a
[00:36:19.220] 你就像在菜单里翻来翻去，试图找到一张可能是什么的图片，或者你会说“拍张照片”。
[00:36:24.100] photo or like you're like zooming in with your eyes like what is in that dish like what is it
[00:36:24.100] 照片，或者就像你用眼睛放大画面一样，看看盘子里装的是什么，那到底是什么？
[00:36:31.460] wait yeah I feel like when I'm like walking into a restaurant and as I'm reading the menu I'm like
[00:36:31.460] 等等，是啊，我觉得就像我走进一家餐厅，一边看菜单一边想：
[00:36:35.620] like when I'm walking I'm like looking over like everyone's table to be like what did you order like
[00:36:35.620] 就像我走路的时候，会不自觉地看看每张桌子，问问大家点了什么。
[00:36:40.260] is it good does it look good yeah because I feel like when you look at like google or like yelp
[00:36:40.260] 它好吗？看起来不错吗？嗯，因为我觉得当你查看像谷歌或Yelp这样的网站时……
[00:36:44.420] pictures of like food a lot of them now are from like the restaurant owners themselves and it's
[00:36:44.420] 现在很多食物照片都是餐馆老板自己拍的，而且
[00:36:48.660] like the really like studio lighting and just like the like when you see like the mcdonald's ads
[00:36:48.660] 就像那种专业的影棚灯光，就像你看到麦当劳广告时看到的那样。
[00:36:53.620] like the burger never looks like that yeah I'm like I want to see what the real deal looks like
[00:36:53.620] 汉堡看起来根本不像那样，是啊，我就想看看它真正的样子。
[00:36:57.620] that's a good move like looking over everyone's shoulders but then sometimes they'll catch you
[00:36:57.620] 这招不错，就像监视每个人一样，但有时候也会被他们发现。
[00:37:02.180] and then you're like my dad wait so that actually happened once I was at a restaurant with my mom
[00:37:02.180] 然后你就说，我爸，等等，这事儿真的发生过一次，当时我和我妈在餐厅吃饭。
[00:37:07.220] and my dad you know we're deciding what to order and then my mom keeps looking over her shoulder
[00:37:07.220] 我爸，你知道，我们正在商量点什么菜，然后我妈就一直回头看。
[00:37:11.940] and she's not even being subtle about it she's like oh that table behind us ordered that one dish
[00:37:11.940] 她一点也不委婉，直接说：“哦，我们后面那桌点了那道菜。”
[00:37:16.180] with like noodles and stuff looks pretty good like maybe we can order that and then she she
[00:37:16.180] 像面条之类的东西看起来挺不错的，也许我们可以点那个，然后她……
[00:37:20.500] like mentions it a couple other times and then finally the table like behind us one of the people
[00:37:20.500] 就像之前几次提到的那样，最后，我们身后的那张桌子旁，有一个人……
[00:37:25.700] they turn around they're like oh actually it's not noodles it's like tofu skin and she's like
[00:37:25.700] 他们转过身，说：“哦，其实这不是面条，是豆腐皮之类的东西。”然后她就说：“
[00:37:30.500] and it's like this one on the menu and I was like oh my god like so yeah I was like I was like
[00:37:30.500] 菜单上就是这个，我当时就想，我的天哪，所以，嗯，我就想，我当时就想……
[00:37:36.340] actually it's not too embarrassing because they were really nice about it but my mom was laughing
[00:37:36.340] 其实也没那么尴尬，因为他们态度很好，但我妈一直在笑。
[00:37:40.980] because she's like oh my god I said the dish wrong so many times that the person like couldn't hold
[00:37:40.980] 因为她会说：“我的天哪，我把菜名说错了太多次，以至于那个人都受不了了。”
[00:37:45.380] it in anymore she's like actually like they're not noodles like this is the last straw
[00:37:45.380] 她再也不想看到这种情况了，她就像在说，这根本不是面条，这简直是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。
[00:37:53.380] she's just fuming at her table eating her not noodles
[00:37:53.380] 她坐在桌边，一边吃着她的“非面条”，一边气呼呼地看着桌子。
[00:37:58.820] she's like I can't just sit here silently and let them be misled like that
[00:37:58.820] 她就像在说，我不能就这么默默地坐在这里，任由他们被误导。
[00:38:03.220] I must speak up oh my god is that the new move then instead of just asking like the waiter or
[00:38:03.220] 我必须开口说话，我的天哪，这就是新招数吗？而不是像以前那样直接问服务员？
[00:38:09.460] the waitress for recommendations also ask all the other tables so what you guys order
[00:38:09.460] 服务员会询问其他桌的客人点了什么菜，以便给出推荐。
[00:38:17.060] would you recommend it I have definitely had people ask oh my god what is that that you
[00:38:17.060] 你会推荐它吗？确实有人问过我，我的天哪，那是什么？
[00:38:22.980] ordered that looks really good but it's like usually a few and far in between but yeah I feel
[00:38:22.980] 点的那个看起来确实不错，但通常数量不多，而且间隔时间也比较长，不过，嗯，我感觉
[00:38:27.860] like I've noticed that the older the person is the like less I guess embarrassed or like nervous
[00:38:27.860] 我注意到，年纪越大的人，似乎就越不觉得尴尬或紧张。
[00:38:35.620] they are about it they just like walk up they're like hey what'd you order here like that looks
[00:38:35.620] 他们就是那种会走过来问“嘿，你点了什么？”的人，看起来就像那样。
[00:38:38.980] fucking great and you're like oh yeah they really don't give a fuck it's very admirable it really
[00:38:38.980] 太棒了，你会想，哦，是啊，他们真的毫不在乎，这非常令人钦佩，真的。
[00:38:43.380] is I'm like wow how do I be more like that even like when you're talking about your mom like doing
[00:38:43.380] 我当时就想，哇，我该怎么才能更像那样呢？即使是在谈论你妈妈的时候，比如……
[00:38:49.300] that I'm like that's that's crazy to like just keep speaking up about that I don't think I would
[00:38:49.300] 我当时就觉得，这太疯狂了，居然有人会一直说这种话，我觉得我不会这么做。
[00:38:53.940] do that yeah I was like mom stop they're gonna hear you I feel like it is the go-to move though
[00:38:53.940] 对，我当时就说：“妈，别这样，他们会听到的。”我觉得这好像是惯用伎俩。
[00:39:02.420] it is sometimes if I don't observe the tables around me I'll get like buyer's remorse like
[00:39:02.420] 有时候，如果我不留意周围的桌子，我就会像买家后悔一样。
[00:39:07.780] last time we went to try out some sort of restaurant we got so excited about the menu we
[00:39:07.780] 上次我们去一家餐厅试菜时，我们对菜单非常感兴趣，
[00:39:11.140] like sat down ordered the stuff that looked good we finished ordering and then that's when you like
[00:39:11.140] 就像坐下来点了看起来不错的东西，我们点完餐后，就喜欢上了。
[00:39:15.620] come to right and like become aware of your surroundings again and then we looked around
[00:39:15.620] 回过神来，重新感知周围的环境，然后我们环顾四周。
[00:39:19.540] we're like oh fuck everyone got that like dry pot thing we ordered the spicy fish like we should
[00:39:19.540] 我们当时就想，卧槽，大家都点了那种干锅菜，我们点了辣鱼，我们明明应该点辣鱼的。
[00:39:24.900] have gotten that so I feel like it is always good to kind of be aware of your surroundings that's
[00:39:24.900] 我已经明白了，所以我觉得时刻留意周围环境总是没错的。
[00:39:29.620] true like you need to look to see like what is the iconic dish that everyone's getting
[00:39:29.620] 确实，你需要看看哪些菜是标志性的，哪些菜是大家都在点的。
[00:39:34.100] oh my god yesterday we went out to dinner and then we were leaving the place as I was walking
[00:39:34.100] 我的天哪，昨天我们出去吃饭，然后我们离开的时候，我正走着。
[00:39:39.220] out I like saw these two desserts on like the bar like that they were about to give out to people
[00:39:39.220] 我看到吧台上摆着这两款甜点，好像是要免费赠送给客人似的。
