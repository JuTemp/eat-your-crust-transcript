[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是克里斯托。
[00:00:03.200] And I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:03.200] 我是 Jeesoo。
[00:00:04.800] So today our episode topic is actually about something that is pretty top of mind for me right now,
[00:00:04.800] 所以今天我们这期节目的主题其实是我目前最关心的事情之一。
[00:00:21.700] which is the honeymoon.
[00:00:21.700] 那就是蜜月旅行。
[00:00:23.900] James, my husband and I just got back from our honeymoon about a week or so ago.
[00:00:23.900] 我和我丈夫詹姆斯大约一周前刚结束蜜月旅行回来。
[00:00:28.700] We spent our honeymoon in Europe for about two weeks.
[00:00:28.700] 我们在欧洲度蜜月，大约两周时间。
[00:00:32.500] So being back, I feel like I have a lot of fresh and funny stories about the honeymoon to share.
[00:00:32.500] 回来之后，我觉得有很多关于蜜月的新鲜有趣的故事可以分享。
[00:00:37.700] We also thought it would be cool to kind of talk about the differences between planning for a honeymoon versus just planning for a regular vacation.
[00:00:37.700] 我们还觉得聊聊蜜月旅行计划和普通度假计划之间的区别会很有意思。
[00:00:44.700] Immediately, my first question for you is when you were planning the trip,
[00:00:44.700] 我首先要问你的问题是，你是什么时候开始计划这次旅行的？
[00:00:50.100] did you specifically try to make it more honeymoon themed or was it kind of just like planning for any old trip?
[00:00:50.100] 你是特意想把它办成蜜月主题旅行，还是只是像计划一次普通的旅行？
[00:00:57.900] Dude, it's funny that you ask that because I think in my mind, there's like a very specific idea of what a honeymoon looks like.
[00:00:57.900] 老兄，你问这个问题真有意思，因为我觉得在我脑海里，蜜月应该是什么样子，有一个非常具体的想法。
[00:01:05.700] And oftentimes in movies and whatnot, I feel like honeymoons are almost centered around going to a really nice resort
[00:01:05.700] 而且在电影之类的作品里，我感觉蜜月旅行几乎总是围绕着去一个非常漂亮的度假村展开。
[00:01:13.500] or maybe somewhere beachy, somewhere where you can get massages and spa and relax and tan.
[00:01:13.500] 或者去海边某个地方，在那里你可以享受按摩、水疗、放松和晒日光浴。
[00:01:19.500] And then you come back just feeling really happy and relaxed.
[00:01:19.500] 然后你回来的时候会感到非常开心和放松。
[00:01:22.900] But for James and I, we actually took about four to five months after the wedding to actually go on our honeymoon.
[00:01:22.900] 但对于我和詹姆斯来说，我们实际上是在婚礼后四到五个月才真正去度蜜月。
[00:01:30.900] There was a shorter family trip that we had planned right after the wedding.
[00:01:30.900] 婚礼结束后，我们计划了一次较短的家庭旅行。
[00:01:34.900] And then also we just wanted to have some real months to like sit down and plan our honeymoon.
[00:01:34.900] 而且我们也想花几个月的时间坐下来好好计划一下蜜月旅行。
[00:01:41.100] So I didn't necessarily feel like I needed that rest and relaxation.
[00:01:41.100] 所以我并不觉得我需要休息和放松。
[00:01:45.300] I kind of wanted to use the honeymoon as an opportunity to visit places that I've always kind of envisioned for myself on our honeymoon.
[00:01:45.300] 我其实想利用蜜月旅行的机会，去一些我一直以来都梦想着蜜月旅行能去的地方。
[00:01:54.100] Oh, I see. No James envisioning?
[00:01:54.100] 哦，我明白了。詹姆斯没有参与构想吗？
[00:01:56.900] Okay, that makes it sound like I was dictatoring the honeymoon, but I swear there was some collaboration.
[00:01:56.900] 好吧，这么说好像是我独断专行地安排了蜜月旅行，但我发誓我们之间确实有一些合作。
[00:02:03.900] Basically, I've always wanted to go to Switzerland for my honeymoon ever since I went for like a day or two in college.
[00:02:03.900] 基本上，自从大学时去过瑞士一两天之后，我就一直想去瑞士度蜜月。
[00:02:11.500] So I was like, oh my god, we have to go to Switzerland, blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:11.500] 所以我就想，我的天哪，我们得去瑞士，等等等等。
[00:02:14.900] And I've always brought that up to James, even when we were like wedding planning actually.
[00:02:14.900] 而且我一直都跟詹姆斯提起过这件事，甚至在我们筹备婚礼的时候也是如此。
[00:02:19.700] But because we're going to Europe, because we wanted to experience like a variety of different environments,
[00:02:19.700] 但因为我们要去欧洲，因为我们想体验各种不同的环境，
[00:02:24.900] so not just nature, but also somewhere with a lot of different cultures or somewhere with a lot of good food and shopping, etc.
[00:02:24.900] 所以不仅是自然风光，还要有多元文化，或者有很多美食和购物场所等等。
[00:02:32.100] James wanted to go to London and Paris as well.
[00:02:32.100] 詹姆斯还想去伦敦和巴黎。
[00:02:34.500] So we did collaborate on the destination.
[00:02:34.500] 所以我们确实在目的地选择上进行了合作。
[00:02:38.700] Just making sure.
[00:02:38.700] 只是确认一下。
[00:02:41.500] But I feel like Switzerland is a good one.
[00:02:41.500] 但我感觉瑞士是个不错的选择。
[00:02:44.500] I always see such beautiful photos of the scenery there.
[00:02:44.500] 我总是看到那里风景如画的美丽照片。
[00:02:48.100] Yeah.
[00:02:48.100] 是的。
[00:02:48.900] And like, you know, the K-drama Crash Landing on You at the end when they're in Switzerland.
[00:02:48.900] 还有，你知道，韩剧《爱的迫降》结尾他们在瑞士的那一幕。
[00:02:54.700] I was like, damn!
[00:02:54.700] 我当时就想，糟了！
[00:02:57.100] Dude, so I've never watched that drama.
[00:02:57.100] 老兄，我从来没看过那部剧。
[00:02:59.300] Oh my god.
[00:02:59.300] 我的天啊。
[00:03:00.300] Literally, I'm not even lying, probably 70 to 80% of the people that I talk to about the honeymoon
[00:03:00.300] 说真的，我一点都没撒谎，跟我聊蜜月的人里，大概有70%到80%的人都这么说。
[00:03:06.300] and I tell them like, oh, I'm going to Switzerland.
[00:03:06.300] 然后我就告诉他们，哦，我要去瑞士。
[00:03:08.700] They're like, oh, for Crash Landing on You.
[00:03:08.700] 他们会说，哦，是为了《爱的迫降》。
[00:03:10.900] And I'm like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:03:10.900] 我当时就想，我完全不知道你在说什么。
[00:03:13.500] Like, I'm not envisioning the same thing in my mind that you're envisioning.
[00:03:13.500] 也就是说，我脑海中想象的和你想象的不一样。
[00:03:16.700] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:03:16.700] 等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:03:18.900] But I feel like overall Switzerland is just a really pretty place.
[00:03:18.900] 但我感觉瑞士总体来说是一个非常美丽的地方。
[00:03:23.100] I don't know.
[00:03:23.100] 我不知道。
[00:03:23.700] Is it romantic?
[00:03:23.700] 这浪漫吗？
[00:03:24.700] Maybe it's romantic because of the views.
[00:03:24.700] 或许是因为风景优美才显得浪漫吧。
[00:03:27.100] I feel like it is like a very popular couples travel destination.
[00:03:27.100] 我觉得这里像是情侣们非常热门的旅游目的地。
[00:03:32.700] But I do want to point out that I think what you did,
[00:03:32.700] 但我确实想指出，我认为你所做的，
[00:03:37.100] which is like take your honeymoon a while later after your wedding,
[00:03:37.100] 这就好比婚后过一段时间再去度蜜月一样。
[00:03:41.700] has been a popular thing lately with people around our age.
[00:03:41.700] 最近这在我们这个年龄段的人群中很流行。
[00:03:45.500] I've noticed that people have been mentioning how like taking the honeymoon right after the wedding
[00:03:45.500] 我注意到有人提到过婚礼后立刻去度蜜月之类的事情
[00:03:51.700] is extremely stressful because that means you're planning your wedding and your honeymoon like at the same time.
[00:03:51.700] 这会造成极大的压力，因为这意味着你要同时筹备婚礼和蜜月旅行。
[00:04:00.700] Right.
[00:04:00.700] 正确的。
[00:04:01.400] And so it like becomes extra work during an already stressful time
[00:04:01.400] 因此，这就像是在原本就压力巨大的时期增加了一项额外的工作。
[00:04:06.100] and a lot of people like to do like a honeymoon fund now in their registry.
[00:04:06.100] 现在很多人喜欢在结婚登记清单里设立蜜月基金。
[00:04:11.100] So I guess people like to collect their funds first before actually starting to plan
[00:04:11.100] 所以我觉得大家喜欢先筹集资金，然后再开始真正规划。
[00:04:16.500] and you know, like purchase the tickets and stuff like that.
[00:04:16.500] 你知道，就像买票之类的。
[00:04:19.600] Right.
[00:04:19.600] 正确的。
[00:04:20.400] So I feel like that's been a trend that I've been noticing.
[00:04:20.400] 所以我觉得这似乎是一种我注意到的趋势。
[00:04:23.600] Yeah, it's so funny too because I see different arrangements on TikTok all the time.
[00:04:23.600] 是啊，也很有趣，因为我经常在TikTok上看到各种各样的编曲。
[00:04:29.100] I actually saw a TikTok recently where someone said that she primarily planned the entire wedding
[00:04:29.100] 我最近在TikTok上看到有人说，她基本上策划了整个婚礼。
[00:04:34.400] and then the husband primarily planned the entire honeymoon.
[00:04:34.400] 然后，整个蜜月旅行基本上都是丈夫策划的。
[00:04:37.200] So at least there's some sort of division of work,
[00:04:37.200] 所以至少还有某种程度的工作分工。
[00:04:39.300] but I was also like, is that a fair division of labor?
[00:04:39.300] 但我当时也在想，这样的劳动分工公平吗？
[00:04:44.400] That's true.
[00:04:44.400] 这是真的。
[00:04:45.400] The wedding is for what like tens to hundreds of people
[00:04:45.400] 婚礼大约有几十到几百人参加。
[00:04:49.500] and then the honeymoon is just like two people.
[00:04:49.500] 然后蜜月就和两个人一样了。
[00:04:52.500] Exactly.
[00:04:52.500] 确切地。
[00:04:53.800] And then I think for us too because we got married in December,
[00:04:53.800] 我觉得对我们来说也是如此，因为我们是在十二月结婚的。
[00:04:57.000] there's not like a ton of different places that are convenient to travel to around that time
[00:04:57.000] 那段时间附近并没有很多方便前往的旅游目的地。
[00:05:02.200] with high costs for holidays and just like weather being pretty cold in a lot of different areas.
[00:05:02.200] 假期费用高昂，而且很多地方天气都很冷。
[00:05:08.200] So I was really happy we took the break
[00:05:08.200] 所以我很高兴我们休息了一段时间。
[00:05:10.300] and then plus I heard a lot of stories where people go on the honeymoon right after the wedding
[00:05:10.300] 而且我还听说很多人婚礼后就直接去度蜜月。
[00:05:15.400] and then they spend like the first two days just like sleeping like 18 hours
[00:05:15.400] 然后他们头两天就几乎都在睡觉，睡了18个小时。
[00:05:20.100] because they're so tired,
[00:05:20.100] 因为他们太累了，
[00:05:21.700] but we were at least kind of like ready to explore
[00:05:21.700] 但我们至少已经做好了探索的准备。
[00:05:24.900] and like feeling rejuvenated.
[00:05:24.900] 感觉焕然一新。
[00:05:26.700] So I thought that was good.
[00:05:26.700] 所以我觉得这很好。
[00:05:28.100] Oh, yeah, that's smart.
[00:05:28.100] 哦，是啊，这主意不错。
[00:05:29.900] I think I've heard so many stories about how you know,
[00:05:29.900] 我想我听过很多关于你如何认识我的故事，
[00:05:33.600] how you're technically supposed to like consummate the marriage after the wedding night,
[00:05:33.600] 按照技术上讲，新婚之夜后应该如何圆房，
[00:05:42.400] but everyone's like, okay realistically,
[00:05:42.400] 但大家都觉得，好吧，说实话，
[00:05:44.400] I just sleep because we're so fucking exhausted after the wedding.
[00:05:44.400] 婚礼结束后我们都累得要死，所以我就直接睡觉了。
[00:05:48.600] Oh my God.
[00:05:48.600] 我的天啊。
[00:05:49.200] I'm just gonna no comment on that one.
[00:05:49.200] 我对此无可奉告。
[00:05:51.200] That's crazy.
[00:05:51.200] 太疯狂了。
[00:05:54.400] Wait, you haven't seen like those reddit threads?
[00:05:54.400] 等等，你没看过Reddit上的那些帖子吗？
[00:05:57.900] I have but it's just so funny to say like consummate.
[00:05:57.900] 我有，但是说“完美”这个词真的太搞笑了。
[00:06:00.900] I don't know.
[00:06:00.900] 我不知道。
[00:06:03.100] I'm trying to keep it PG.
[00:06:03.100] 我尽量保持内容适合所有年龄段。
[00:06:06.800] But yeah, like imagine hopping on a plane the day after your wedding.
[00:06:06.800] 是啊，想象一下婚礼第二天就坐飞机去旅行。
[00:06:10.400] Oh God. Imagine packing.
[00:06:10.400] 我的天啊。想想打包行李是什么感觉。
[00:06:13.200] Oh my God.
[00:06:13.200] 我的天啊。
[00:06:13.900] For your honeymoon.
[00:06:13.900] 为你们的蜜月之旅。
[00:06:14.900] You're so right.
[00:06:14.900] 你说得太对了。
[00:06:16.900] It's like okay, we have five hours between the end of this wedding and our flight.
[00:06:16.900] 好吧，婚礼结束到我们赶飞机之间有五个小时。
[00:06:22.100] Exactly.
[00:06:22.100] 确切地。
[00:06:23.600] But I thought when you asked in your original question about like wanting to have the honeymoon be romantic is actually quite funny
[00:06:23.600] 但我认为，你最初的问题中提到的“希望蜜月浪漫”其实挺搞笑的。
[00:06:32.200] because one like I said,
[00:06:32.200] 因为就像我刚才说的，
[00:06:34.400] I felt like our honeymoon being in multiple different like metropolitan cities didn't feel as classic resorty vacationing honeymoon.
[00:06:34.400] 我觉得我们的蜜月旅行去了好几个不同的大都市，感觉不像传统的度假式蜜月旅行。
[00:06:43.400] But two although when we were planning I wasn't necessarily thinking like oh we have to do these things that are romantic.
[00:06:43.400] 但是，虽然我们在做计划的时候，我并没有想着“哦，我们必须做一些浪漫的事情”。
[00:06:50.300] I felt like when we were there I kind of had this internal pressure of like,
[00:06:50.300] 我觉得我们在那里的时候，我内心好像有一种压力，就像是……
[00:06:54.500] oh my God, it's our honeymoon.
[00:06:54.500] 我的天哪，这是我们的蜜月旅行。
[00:06:55.800] This needs to be special.
[00:06:55.800] 这必须很特别。
[00:06:57.800] This is gonna sound hella entitled and it probably is a little bit
[00:06:57.800] 这话听起来可能很自以为是，而且可能确实有点儿。
[00:07:01.500] but I felt this like immense pressure to bring it up to like hotel people to be like,
[00:07:01.500] 但我感到压力巨大，不得不向酒店方面提出这个问题，让他们觉得……
[00:07:08.000] oh, yeah, like we're on our honeymoon hoping that they would give us like free shit.
[00:07:08.000] 哦，是啊，就像我们在度蜜月一样，希望他们能给我们一些免费的东西。
[00:07:12.600] Maybe not so much as an upgrade but maybe like a brownie or something.
[00:07:12.600] 或许算不上升级，但就像一块布朗尼蛋糕之类的东西。
[00:07:17.900] Or like a bottle of champagne in your room.
[00:07:17.900] 或者就像房间里放着一瓶香槟一样。
[00:07:20.000] Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:20.000] 对，没错。
[00:07:21.300] Did it work?
[00:07:21.300] 成功了吗？
[00:07:22.400] Did you get any free stuff?
[00:07:22.400] 你拿到免费的东西了吗？
[00:07:24.800] So we stayed in four different hotels over like two weeks or so.
[00:07:24.800] 所以，在两周左右的时间里，我们住了四家不同的酒店。
[00:07:28.900] Me and James were brave enough to mention it to three of the hotels.
[00:07:28.900] 我和詹姆斯鼓起勇气向三家酒店提到了这件事。
[00:07:32.000] Hey, that's pretty good.
[00:07:32.000] 嘿，这相当不错。
[00:07:33.200] Yeah, that's not bad three or four is pretty good.
[00:07:33.200] 是的，三四个还不错，挺好的。
[00:07:35.100] It took a lot of courage actually.
[00:07:35.100] 这其实需要很大的勇气。
[00:07:36.300] That's a passing grade.
[00:07:36.300] 这是及格分数。
[00:07:39.300] But the first place they really did give us like a chocolate lava cake
[00:07:39.300] 但他们第一次真的给了我们一个巧克力熔岩蛋糕
[00:07:42.500] and then it said happy honeymoon or something and I was like this is really cute.
[00:07:42.500] 然后上面写着“蜜月快乐”之类的话，我就觉得这真可爱。
[00:07:46.400] The second place we got nervous and couldn't say it.
[00:07:46.400] 到了第二个地方，我们紧张得说不出话来。
[00:07:50.000] The third place they gave us like a little tin of chocolates
[00:07:50.000] 第三名他们给了我们一小罐巧克力。
[00:07:55.000] and then like a thing of macarons or something which is super cute.
[00:07:55.000] 然后还有像马卡龙之类的东西，超级可爱。
[00:07:58.500] And then the last place gave us a bottle of champagne and like nuts
[00:07:58.500] 最后那家店给了我们一瓶香槟和坚果。
[00:08:02.900] and I was like, oh my god, it's like a gradually getting like nicer and nicer essentially.
[00:08:02.900] 我当时就想，我的天哪，这感觉就像是逐渐变得越来越好了。
[00:08:07.800] I like that.
[00:08:07.800] 我喜欢这个。
[00:08:09.000] Have you ever stayed at these hotels before?
[00:08:09.000] 你以前住过这些酒店吗？
[00:08:11.300] No, I haven't.
[00:08:11.300] 不，我没有。
[00:08:12.600] Okay, because I'm like what if they already do that?
[00:08:12.600] 好吧，因为我就在想，万一他们已经这么做了呢？
[00:08:17.400] Like they're like, oh they're on their honeymoon just throw in like a honeymoon card or something.
[00:08:17.400] 就像他们会说，哦，他们在度蜜月，那就送张蜜月卡之类的东西吧。
[00:08:22.600] Dude probably.
[00:08:22.600] 大概是男的吧。
[00:08:24.000] We also went to like a more upscale restaurant one of the nights
[00:08:24.000] 其中一天晚上，我们还去了一家比较高档的餐厅。
[00:08:27.400] and then they were like, oh what's the occasion blah blah blah
[00:08:27.400] 然后他们就说，哦，这是什么场合啊，等等等等。
[00:08:30.400] and we were like, oh we're on our honeymoon.
[00:08:30.400] 我们当时就想，哦，我们正在度蜜月呢。
[00:08:32.300] So, you know, we're just here to celebrate.
[00:08:32.300] 所以，你知道，我们今天就是来庆祝的。
[00:08:34.700] You can kind of hear like what people around you are talking about with their waiters
[00:08:34.700] 你可以隐约听到周围的人在和他们的服务员谈论什么。
[00:08:38.700] and also what they're getting right?
[00:08:38.700] 他们做对了什么？
[00:08:40.400] So I heard the tables next to us get a happy birthday like little free dessert or something
[00:08:40.400] 我听说隔壁桌的客人过生日的时候会收到一份生日小礼物，比如免费甜点之类的。
[00:08:45.800] and I was like, oh my god, that's so cute.
[00:08:45.800] 我当时就想，我的天哪，这也太可爱了吧。
[00:08:47.100] And like internally I was low-key wondering if they were going to do one for us.
[00:08:47.100] 我内心其实很想知道他们会不会也给我们做一个。
[00:08:50.700] Yeah, but they didn't.
[00:08:50.700] 是啊，但他们没有。
[00:08:52.600] Instead they gave us a signed card with a little note for us
[00:08:52.600] 他们没有给我们看别的，而是给了我们一张签名卡片，上面还有一张写给我们的小纸条。
[00:08:57.600] and then it was like, oh like thank you from the chef
[00:08:57.600] 然后就好像，哦，像是厨师的感谢。
[00:08:59.500] and the team for visiting on the honeymoon blah blah blah, which is very sweet.
[00:08:59.500] 还有团队来探望我们度蜜月等等等等，真是太贴心了。
[00:09:03.400] But I was also just like damn I wonder what qualifies for free dessert
[00:09:03.400] 但我当时也想，哎，不知道什么样的甜点才能免费吃到呢？
[00:09:07.000] and like what doesn't at these restaurants?
[00:09:07.000] 这些餐厅里还有什么不这样呢？
[00:09:09.100] Maybe you have to tell them in advance.
[00:09:09.100] 或许你需要提前告诉他们。
[00:09:11.500] Oh that yeah, that could be true.
[00:09:11.500] 哦，那倒有可能。
[00:09:13.400] I'm wondering because at least in the US nowadays a lot of the reservation systems,
[00:09:13.400] 我之所以感到疑惑，是因为至少在美国，如今很多预订系统都是如此。
[00:09:19.600] they'll ask you like, oh are you celebrating anything?
[00:09:19.600] 他们会问你，比如，“哦，你们在庆祝什么吗？”
[00:09:22.600] I wonder if maybe that's part of it.
[00:09:22.600] 我怀疑这或许是其中的一部分原因。
[00:09:24.600] They're like, okay we can prep this shit for them.
[00:09:24.600] 他们就像，好吧，我们可以帮他们准备好这些东西。
[00:09:27.700] That's true because we did spring it on them kind of early on in the dinner.
[00:09:27.700] 没错，因为我们在晚餐开始不久就给了他们一个惊喜。
[00:09:32.300] Hmm. I guess they did give you something like a signed card but not dessert.
[00:09:32.300] 嗯，看来他们确实给了你一张签名卡片之类的东西，但没有甜点。
[00:09:39.300] It was just like that mindset I was in, you know,
[00:09:39.300] 我当时就是那种心态，你知道的。
[00:09:41.600] I think it was less so that partly I did want to get some free cool stuff.
[00:09:41.600] 我觉得这与其说是想获得一些免费的酷炫物品，不如说是想得到一些免费的好东西。
[00:09:47.000] You only go on one honeymoon in your lifetime.
[00:09:47.000] 一生只有一次蜜月旅行。
[00:09:50.300] Well...
[00:09:50.300] 出色地...
[00:09:51.800] Well, um...
[00:09:51.800] 嗯……
[00:09:55.900] Maybe that's not a guarantee.
[00:09:55.900] 也许这并不能保证什么。
[00:09:57.900] That's not a guarantee.
[00:09:57.900] 那并不能保证什么。
[00:10:00.100] You go on n number of honeymoons.
[00:10:00.100] 你们会去度n次蜜月。
[00:10:05.360] Ideally one honeymoon per life.
[00:10:05.360] 理想情况下，一生只应有一次蜜月旅行。
[00:10:08.960] But I think another part of me was just on like reddit and stuff.
[00:10:08.960] 但我感觉我内心还有一部分在刷Reddit之类的网站。
[00:10:14.260] I feel like people are always like, oh you should take advantage of being on your honeymoon
[00:10:14.260] 我觉得人们总是会说，哦，你应该好好享受蜜月时光。
[00:10:18.360] and get all this free stuff.
[00:10:18.360] 而且还能获得所有这些免费赠品。
[00:10:20.160] So then I didn't want to be the idiot that doesn't mention it
[00:10:20.160] 所以我不想做那个不提这件事的傻瓜。
[00:10:23.560] and then like doesn't get stuff, you know?
[00:10:23.560] 然后就像什么都没得到一样，你知道吗？
[00:10:25.360] So I think it was kind of like a double-edged sword.
[00:10:25.360] 所以我觉得这有点像一把双刃剑。
[00:10:27.460] It was cool getting free stuff here and there
[00:10:27.460] 能时不时拿到免费的东西真不错。
[00:10:30.060] but also I feel like the pressure of it was like a little much for me
[00:10:30.060] 但我觉得这件事给我的压力有点太大了。
[00:10:33.060] because I don't love to like ask for these things normally.
[00:10:33.060] 因为我通常不太喜欢开口要这些东西。
[00:10:36.260] Like I hold a lot of shame for no reason about these things.
[00:10:36.260] 我好像对这些事感到莫名的羞耻。
[00:10:40.160] Yeah, I think I get what you mean.
[00:10:40.160] 是的，我想我明白你的意思了。
[00:10:41.860] It's like almost like embarrassment sometimes
[00:10:41.860] 有时感觉就像有点尴尬。
[00:10:44.360] when like they come out with, you know, this thing with a candle in it.
[00:10:44.360] 就像他们推出那种，你知道的，里面有蜡烛的东西。
[00:10:48.360] You're like, oh god now everyone's gonna look at me.
[00:10:48.360] 你会想，哦天哪，现在所有人都会看我了。
[00:10:50.460] Please stop.
[00:10:50.460] 请停下。
[00:10:53.360] I think like it's not as bad when they ask you,
[00:10:53.360] 我觉得当他们问你的时候，情况并没有那么糟糕。
[00:10:57.560] you know, what brings you into the city or whatever
[00:10:57.560] 你知道，是什么让你来到这座城市之类的。
[00:10:59.760] but sometimes the conversation doesn't go there, right?
[00:10:59.760] 但有时候谈话并不会朝着那个方向发展，对吧？
[00:11:02.460] Like you guys are talking about something else.
[00:11:02.460] 你们好像在聊别的事情。
[00:11:04.060] So then I feel like what really made me feel a little bit embarrassed
[00:11:04.060] 所以，我觉得真正让我感到有点尴尬的是什么呢？
[00:11:07.760] was like at the check-in counter when I was like rolling through my head of like,
[00:11:07.760] 当时我在办理入住手续的时候，脑子里一直在想着：
[00:11:11.760] okay, how do I bring up that I'm on my honeymoon
[00:11:11.760] 好吧，我该怎么开口说我正在度蜜月呢？
[00:11:14.360] without being like, I'm on my honeymoon.
[00:11:14.360] 别让人觉得我是在度蜜月。
[00:11:16.260] Like give me something free.
[00:11:16.260] 给我点免费的东西吧。
[00:11:20.660] Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of societal expectation.
[00:11:20.660] 是的，我觉得社会上有很多期望。
[00:11:25.460] Like we always hear stories about people being like,
[00:11:25.460] 我们总是听到这样的故事：
[00:11:28.260] yeah, if you just mention that you're on your honeymoon
[00:11:28.260] 是的，如果你直接说你们在度蜜月的话。
[00:11:30.960] places will usually give you some sort of free thing
[00:11:30.960] 通常情况下，一些地方会赠送一些免费的东西。
[00:11:33.660] or like, you know, some sort of nice gift.
[00:11:33.660] 或者，你知道，送点什么好礼物之类的。
[00:11:36.360] And so that like expectation builds in your mind.
[00:11:36.360] 于是，这种期待感便在你心中滋生。
[00:11:39.260] You're like, okay now I just have to figure, you know,
[00:11:39.260] 你会想，好吧，现在我只需要弄清楚，你知道，
[00:11:42.260] like I'll get something now.
[00:11:42.260] 好像我现在就能得到什么似的。
[00:11:43.760] I just have to figure out how to mention it.
[00:11:43.760] 我得想想该怎么提起这件事。
[00:11:46.760] And then if you don't get, you know,
[00:11:46.760] 如果你没明白，你知道，
[00:11:48.360] maybe a gift as like nice as what people online are saying they've gotten.
[00:11:48.360] 或许会收到一份像网上人们说的那样好的礼物。
[00:11:53.460] It's like oh shoot.
[00:11:53.460] 感觉就像，糟了。
[00:11:54.860] I guess it didn't meet expectations.
[00:11:54.860] 看来它没有达到预期。
[00:11:56.560] But in the reality the expectations are like just completely arbitrary.
[00:11:56.560] 但实际上，这些期望完全是任意的。
[00:12:01.260] Yeah, I'm like, well, I guess I didn't get any sort of upgrades,
[00:12:01.260] 是啊，我就想，好吧，看来我没得到任何升级。
[00:12:05.160] but it's cool to kind of get some stuff here and there.
[00:12:05.160] 但偶尔能买到一些东西也挺不错的。
[00:12:08.960] But the cool thing about, you know, being on our honeymoon
[00:12:08.960] 但你知道，蜜月旅行最棒的地方在于……
[00:12:11.560] kind of organically coming up in casual conversations with strangers was
[00:12:11.560] 在与陌生人的随意交谈中自然而然地谈到这一点是
[00:12:15.960] it low-key just felt very good to be like,
[00:12:15.960] 感觉真的很好，就像……
[00:12:17.860] oh my God, like we're on our honeymoon
[00:12:17.860] 我的天哪，感觉就像在度蜜月一样。
[00:12:19.960] and they're always like, oh my gosh, congrats.
[00:12:19.960] 他们总是说，我的天哪，恭喜！
[00:12:21.760] So cool blah blah blah.
[00:12:21.760] 太酷了，等等等等。
[00:12:23.060] And I feel like it always led for like a very natural conversation
[00:12:23.060] 我觉得这总是能自然而然地引出一段对话。
[00:12:26.560] regardless of whether or not they're going to give us free stuff.
[00:12:26.560] 不管他们是否会给我们免费的东西。
[00:12:30.160] I'd say over half the time when we were just conversing with like a waiter
[00:12:30.160] 我觉得超过一半的时间，我们只是在和像服务员这样的人聊天。
[00:12:33.760] or you know, just like people that we were interacting with.
[00:12:33.760] 或者，你知道，就像我们接触的那些人一样。
[00:12:37.060] We didn't have like an ulterior motive to bring it up
[00:12:37.060] 我们提起这件事并没有什么不可告人的目的。
[00:12:40.760] and people are just very happy for you
[00:12:40.760] 大家都为你感到非常高兴。
[00:12:42.160] even though we're just like complete strangers.
[00:12:42.160] 即使我们彼此完全陌生。
[00:12:44.160] So I think that energy felt really nice.
[00:12:44.160] 所以我觉得那种感觉真的很好。
[00:12:46.260] True.
[00:12:46.260] 真的。
[00:12:47.160] I guess we must release ourselves of the ulterior motives.
[00:12:47.160] 我想我们必须摒弃那些不可告人的动机。
[00:12:51.360] It's the greed that ruins everything.
[00:12:51.360] 贪婪毁了一切。
[00:12:54.460] Okay, but I do have a tip for you for next time.
[00:12:54.460] 好的，但我下次可以给你个建议。
[00:12:58.460] Maybe you can just, you know how now if you book stuff online,
[00:12:58.460] 也许你可以，你知道现在如果你在网上预订东西的话，该怎么做？
[00:13:02.460] you can sometimes message the hotel beforehand
[00:13:02.460] 有时可以提前给酒店发信息。
[00:13:05.860] whether it's like through Expedia or like some sort of direct email.
[00:13:05.860] 无论是通过 Expedia 还是通过某种直接电子邮件。
[00:13:09.860] Maybe in that you can like say,
[00:13:09.860] 或许你可以这样说：
[00:13:11.960] hey, we're celebrating something like a birthday or whatever
[00:13:11.960] 嘿，我们在庆祝生日之类的。
[00:13:16.260] and then maybe that reduces your need for in-person interaction.
[00:13:16.260] 这样或许就能减少你对面对面交流的需求。
[00:13:22.160] True.
[00:13:22.160] 真的。
[00:13:22.960] Next time you can hit 404.
[00:13:22.960] 下次你可能会遇到 404 错误。
[00:13:24.960] So we actually did do that.
[00:13:24.960] 我们确实这么做了。
[00:13:26.860] Oh, you did?
[00:13:26.860] 哦，你真的这么做了？
[00:13:27.360] For hotel bookings because you can usually put in like a little note like you said.
[00:13:27.360] 酒店预订的话，通常可以像你说的加个小备注。
[00:13:31.260] So then we put like, oh so excited to come.
[00:13:31.260] 所以我们就写上“哦，好兴奋，期待到来”。
[00:13:33.360] We'll be on our honeymoon whatever
[00:13:33.360] 不管怎样，我们都会去度蜜月。
[00:13:35.460] or like sometimes we just put like honeymoon or something.
[00:13:35.460] 或者有时候我们会写蜜月之类的。
[00:13:38.660] Honeymoon period.
[00:13:38.660] 蜜月期。
[00:13:41.560] But I think it depends on the hotel.
[00:13:41.560] 但我认为这取决于酒店。
[00:13:43.360] So one of the hotels, we actually forgot to bring it up
[00:13:43.360] 所以，我们竟然忘了提其中一家酒店。
[00:13:46.160] and then I was almost thinking like should we go like call them or something?
[00:13:46.160] 然后我就在想，我们是不是应该给他们打个电话什么的？
[00:13:49.860] Yeah.
[00:13:49.860] 是的。
[00:13:50.760] Again, it's the greed but because they saw the note
[00:13:50.760] 还是贪婪作祟，因为他们看到了那张纸条。
[00:13:54.060] they had already prepared something in their room.
[00:13:54.060] 他们已经在房间里准备好了一些东西。
[00:13:56.060] So then we didn't have to do anything but a different hotel like we had put it in the note,
[00:13:56.060] 所以，我们只需要像纸条上写的那样，换一家酒店就行了。
[00:14:00.660] but they didn't do something and that one we were staying multiple days.
[00:14:00.660] 但他们什么也没做，而我们却在那里住了好几天。
[00:14:04.460] So I don't know.
[00:14:04.460] 我也不知道。
[00:14:05.460] I was kind of like are they going to do something on the last day or something?
[00:14:05.460] 我当时就在想，他们最后一天会不会有什么特别的活动？
[00:14:08.660] Probably because we didn't bring it up during checking like they didn't do anything.
[00:14:08.660] 可能是因为我们在检查时没有提出这个问题，就好像他们什么都没做一样。
[00:14:12.560] I see.
[00:14:12.560] 我懂了。
[00:14:13.060] Yeah, I think it's a good tip for shy people like me just put it in the note
[00:14:13.060] 是的，我觉得这对于像我这样害羞的人来说是个好建议，直接写在便条里就行了。
[00:14:16.960] and then try to bring it up during check-in.
[00:14:16.960] 然后尝试在办理入住手续时提出这个问题。
[00:14:20.660] You did your best.
[00:14:20.660] 你已经尽力了。
[00:14:21.660] You tried.
[00:14:21.660] 你尽力了。
[00:14:24.360] The rest is up to the hotel if they're feeling it or not.
[00:14:24.360] 剩下的就看酒店是否愿意了。
[00:14:28.360] Yeah, it's like mildly embarrassing talking about this actually.
[00:14:28.360] 是啊，其实谈论这件事还挺尴尬的。
[00:14:31.960] It was a huge source of stress for me on our trip.
[00:14:31.960] 这给我的旅行带来了巨大的压力。
[00:14:35.760] No, I totally get that though because I've seen a lot of I don't know like forums,
[00:14:35.760] 不，我完全理解，因为我见过很多类似的论坛。
[00:14:40.660] Reddit threads things like that where people are like one of the most common examples is like flights.
[00:14:40.660] Reddit 上有很多类似的帖子，其中最常见的例子之一就是航班。
[00:14:45.960] They're like you should just walk up to the flight attendant doing the check-ins
[00:14:45.960] 他们说你应该直接走到办理登机手续的乘务员面前。
[00:14:50.560] and just ask is there a seat upgrade available
[00:14:50.560] 只需询问是否有座位升级即可。
[00:14:53.660] and you know, they'll usually give it to you and I'm like,
[00:14:53.660] 你知道，他们通常会把东西给你，然后我就想，
[00:14:55.860] is it really that easy?
[00:14:55.860] 真的就这么简单吗？
[00:14:58.160] Are you sure?
[00:14:58.160] 你确定吗？
[00:15:01.060] I know I for sure did not have the cojones to do that.
[00:15:01.060] 我知道我肯定没有那个胆量去做那件事。
[00:15:04.360] Although a flight attendant randomly asked me
[00:15:04.360] 虽然一位空乘人员随机问我
[00:15:07.060] and James why we were traveling which I feel like never happens.
[00:15:07.060] 詹姆斯问我们为什么在旅行，我觉得这事儿以前从来没发生过。
[00:15:10.760] Yeah, and we're like, oh my God, we're on our honeymoon.
[00:15:10.760] 是啊，我们当时就想，我的天哪，我们这是在度蜜月呢。
[00:15:13.360] And then after that every time she came around for a drink.
[00:15:13.360] 之后每次她过来喝酒。
[00:15:15.460] She would be like all my lovebirds like my honeymooners
[00:15:15.460] 她会像我所有的爱侣一样，就像我的蜜月旅行者一样。
[00:15:18.960] and she was just like the nicest person ever.
[00:15:18.960] 她简直是我见过最善良的人。
[00:15:20.860] So that's cute.
[00:15:20.860] 真可爱。
[00:15:22.460] Yeah, so our trip started off on like a very positive note with her being super nice.
[00:15:22.460] 是的，所以我们的旅行一开始就非常顺利，她人超级好。
[00:15:28.660] I will say one time speaking of you know,
[00:15:28.660] 有一次，说到你知道的，我想说的是……
[00:15:31.360] bringing stuff up and asking for things at like hotels
[00:15:31.360] 把东西带上去，或者在酒店之类的地方提要求。
[00:15:34.660] and all that one time I was staying at a hotel
[00:15:34.660] 那一次我一直住在酒店里。
[00:15:38.760] and my room was right across from the elevator
[00:15:38.760] 我的房间就在电梯对面。
[00:15:42.160] and I was like shoot it's kind of loud like I can literally hear
[00:15:42.160] 我当时就想，糟了，声音有点大，我都能听见。
[00:15:45.060] when people are coming up and like leaving especially
[00:15:45.060] 当人们走过来又想离开的时候，尤其如此。
[00:15:48.160] because I think it was like a weekend or maybe it was a Friday night.
[00:15:48.160] 因为我觉得那天可能是周末，也可能是周五晚上。
[00:15:51.260] So people were being loud and active
[00:15:51.260] 所以人们都很吵闹，也很活跃。
[00:15:54.460] and little rowdy, you know, so I was like,
[00:15:54.460] 而且还有点吵闹，你知道，所以我就想，
[00:15:59.760] I think I literally was in my room like mustering up courage for like 40 minutes.
[00:15:59.760] 我觉得我当时真的在房间里待了大概40分钟，鼓起勇气。
[00:16:06.160] Oh my God, and I was like, okay, I'm just going to go down there.
[00:16:06.160] 我的天哪，我就想，好吧，我这就下去看看。
[00:16:08.860] I'm going to go to the check-in table
[00:16:08.860] 我要去办理入住手续的桌子那里。
[00:16:10.660] and I'm just going to be like hey, do you have other rooms available
[00:16:10.660] 我就会问，嘿，你们还有其他空房吗？
[00:16:14.160] because mine is across from the elevator.
[00:16:14.160] 因为我的房间就在电梯对面。
[00:16:17.260] It's a little loud.
[00:16:17.260] 有点吵。
[00:16:20.160] After you know, 30 or 40 minutes of mustering up the courage.
[00:16:20.160] 你知道，这需要30到40分钟的鼓起勇气。
[00:16:24.560] I finally go down and I ask and the guy was like,
[00:16:24.560] 我终于下去问了，那人说：
[00:16:27.260] yeah, let me check and he was like, sorry, we don't have any rooms
[00:16:27.260] 好的，我查一下，然后他说，抱歉，我们没有空房了。
[00:16:29.560] and I was like dude, I could have just stayed in my room
[00:16:29.560] 我当时就想，老兄，我本来可以待在房间里的。
[00:16:32.360] and kept my mouth shut.
[00:16:32.360] 我保持沉默。
[00:16:36.560] Wait, that's so sad, unrewarded.
[00:16:36.560] 等等，这太可惜了，没有得到回报。
[00:16:39.260] The results would have been the same.
[00:16:39.260] 结果是一样的。
[00:16:42.160] So I totally understand the like stress
[00:16:42.160] 所以我完全理解那种压力
[00:16:44.960] and fear of like bringing something up
[00:16:44.960] 害怕提起某些事情
[00:16:48.060] when people are always like no, it's so easy.
[00:16:48.060] 当人们总是说“不”的时候，事情就变得很容易了。
[00:16:49.960] Just ask and like dude, is it that easy though?
[00:16:49.960] 你就问问呗，老兄，真有那么容易吗？
[00:16:54.560] Yeah, and people are like, oh you should lie about being on your honeymoon.
[00:16:54.560] 是啊，人们会说，哦，你应该撒谎说你在度蜜月。
[00:16:58.160] I'm like I'm on my honeymoon and I still can't bring it up.
[00:16:58.160] 我感觉自己还在度蜜月，却还是没法提起这件事。
[00:17:02.360] It's a tough world out there.
[00:17:02.360] 外面的世界很艰难。
[00:17:04.460] Dude, it really is.
[00:17:04.460] 老兄，确实如此。
[00:17:06.360] Well besides announcing that you're on your honeymoon to various service workers.
[00:17:06.360] 除了向各种服务人员宣布你在度蜜月之外。
[00:17:12.560] To people who did not ask.
[00:17:12.560] 致那些没有询问的人。
[00:17:15.460] When you're like planning activities and stuff for your trip.
[00:17:15.460] 当你在计划旅行活动和各种事情的时候。
[00:17:19.060] Did you try to choose activities or like locations
[00:17:19.060] 你有没有尝试选择活动或喜欢的地点？
[00:17:23.660] or like dining options that leaned more romantic I guess?
[00:17:23.660] 或者说，是更偏向浪漫的用餐选择？
[00:17:28.560] Or was it less intentionally romantic, I guess?
[00:17:28.560] 或者说，它其实并没有刻意营造浪漫氛围？
[00:17:32.660] So I think there were a couple of things that we did during planning
[00:17:32.660] 所以我觉得我们在计划阶段做了几件事。
[00:17:37.060] and also on the trip actually that helped the trip feel a lot more special
[00:17:37.060] 而且，在旅途中，这也确实让这次旅行感觉更加特别。
[00:17:41.860] and really more like a honeymoon.
[00:17:41.860] 更像是一次蜜月旅行。
[00:17:43.760] One thing being since this isn't just a normal vacation,
[00:17:43.760] 有一点需要说明，因为这并非一次普通的假期，
[00:17:47.260] we try not to conserve costs as much as we normally would.
[00:17:47.260] 我们尽量不像往常那样竭力节省成本。
[00:17:51.360] So for example staying at nicer hotels than we normally would book,
[00:17:51.360] 例如，入住比我们通常预订的更好的酒店。
[00:17:55.560] booking maybe more nice dinners or going to nicer bars than we normally would
[00:17:55.560] 可能会预订更多高档晚餐，或者去比平时更高级的酒吧。
[00:18:00.860] and then also not being afraid to indulge in certain things.
[00:18:00.860] 而且也不要害怕放纵自己去做某些事情。
[00:18:04.560] So like going to the spa and things like that.
[00:18:04.560] 比如去水疗中心之类的。
[00:18:07.160] I thought it was interesting one like obviously staying at nicer hotels is like a dream.
[00:18:07.160] 我觉得这很有意思，就像住在比较好的酒店就像做梦一样。
[00:18:12.160] So that was great.
[00:18:12.160] 那真是太好了。
[00:18:13.260] Yeah, but two because it was a honeymoon.
[00:18:13.260] 是的，但因为是蜜月旅行，所以是两次。
[00:18:16.060] I felt like both of us were very conscious about not trying to like overexert ourselves
[00:18:16.060] 我觉得我们俩都很注意不要过度劳累。
[00:18:21.560] and not trying to like force ourself to sightsee
[00:18:21.560] 我们并不是强迫自己去观光。
[00:18:24.960] because I think sometimes traveling can really feel like
[00:18:24.960] 因为我觉得有时候旅行真的会让人感觉像
[00:18:27.260] oh we need to hit these landmarks and like do these things etc.
[00:18:27.260] 哦，我们需要去这些地标景点，做这些事情等等。
[00:18:31.260] But for us like there are definitely things that we wanted to hit on our itinerary,
[00:18:31.260] 但对我们来说，行程安排中肯定有一些我们想去的地方。
[00:18:36.260] but if not wasn't a huge deal.
[00:18:36.260] 但即便不是这样，也不是什么大事。
[00:18:38.360] One of the days we even stayed in the hotel room and watched our favorite TV show
[00:18:38.360] 其中有一天我们甚至待在酒店房间里，看了我们最喜欢的电视节目。
[00:18:42.860] and got like room service and stuff,
[00:18:42.860] 然后就叫了客房服务之类的，
[00:18:44.660] which I feel like on a normal vacation I wouldn't do something like that.
[00:18:44.660] 我觉得在正常的假期里我是不会做这种事的。
[00:18:48.160] So it just really felt nice
[00:18:48.160] 所以感觉真的很好。
[00:18:50.160] and I think what I liked about it the most was it very much so felt like us finding our rhythm together
[00:18:50.160] 我觉得我最喜欢的一点是，它让我们感觉彼此找到了默契。
[00:18:57.360] and connecting with each other
[00:18:57.360] 并彼此联系
[00:18:59.460] which is something that I feel like goes up and down during like normal vacations.
[00:18:59.460] 我觉得这种感觉在正常的假期里会时而高涨时而低落。
[00:19:04.460] That's true because I feel like normal vacations can have some moments of like stress
[00:19:04.460] 确实如此，因为我觉得正常的假期也难免会有些压力。
[00:19:10.460] when you're like, oh god, we need to make this like reservation
[00:19:10.460] 当你突然意识到，“天哪，我们需要预订一下”的时候
[00:19:13.760] or we need to run across the city to like get to this place to sightsee or whatever.
[00:19:13.760] 或者我们需要穿越整个城市才能到达这个地方观光什么的。
[00:19:18.760] So it sounds like you tried to keep things as low stress as possible.
[00:19:18.760] 听起来你尽量把压力降到了最低。
[00:19:23.060] Yeah, although we did have a really high stress moment
[00:19:23.060] 是的，虽然我们当时确实经历了一段非常紧张的时期。
[00:19:25.560] where we somehow in our planning booked the wrong train slash the wrong flight.
[00:19:25.560] 我们在计划行程时不知何故订错了火车票或航班。
[00:19:31.260] So we had booked a train from Paris to London on our last day
[00:19:31.260] 所以我们在最后一天预订了从巴黎到伦敦的火车票。
[00:19:34.160] because our flight to the US was out of London,
[00:19:34.160] 因为我们飞往美国的航班是从伦敦起飞的。
[00:19:37.760] but the train that we booked somehow arrived at London
[00:19:37.760] 但我们预订的火车不知何故还是到了伦敦。
[00:19:41.760] literally when we were supposed to be boarding the plane.
[00:19:41.760] 就在我们本该登机的时候。
[00:19:44.360] I guess I don't know how we just missed it completely in our planning process,
[00:19:44.360] 我真不明白为什么我们在计划过程中会完全忽略这一点。
[00:19:48.960] but we didn't even realize until we were about to get off the train.
[00:19:48.960] 但直到我们快要下火车时才意识到这一点。
[00:19:52.360] We were like what the fuck like, I don't know how
[00:19:52.360] 我们当时都懵了，不知道怎么回事。
[00:19:54.360] and I feel like if you know me and James,
[00:19:54.360] 我觉得如果你了解我和詹姆斯，
[00:19:55.960] we're not really the type of people to like do stuff like that.
[00:19:55.960] 我们其实不是那种会做那种事的人。
[00:19:58.360] Yeah, we just completely forgot slash it slipped our mind
[00:19:58.360] 是啊，我们完全忘了，或者说我们一时疏忽了。
[00:20:02.360] slash every time we checked we didn't even notice.
[00:20:02.360] 每次检查时我们都没注意到斜杠。
[00:20:04.160] Oh my God.
[00:20:04.160] 我的天啊。
[00:20:05.060] Everything ended up being okay.
[00:20:05.060] 最后一切都好起来了。
[00:20:06.460] We called the airport and they were able to rebook us with no fee
[00:20:06.460] 我们打电话给机场，他们帮我们免费改签了机票。
[00:20:10.560] to fly a couple hours later.
[00:20:10.560] 几个小时后起飞。
[00:20:12.060] Nice, but I was like whoa, maybe we were like too in tune with each other
[00:20:12.060] 挺好的，但我当时想，哇，我们是不是太合拍了？
[00:20:15.960] and like not in tune enough with the schedule.
[00:20:15.960] 而且似乎对日程安排不够熟悉。
[00:20:21.160] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:20:21.160] 等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:20:22.060] I'm just imagining every time you two check.
[00:20:22.060] 我只是在想象你们俩每次检查时的情景。
[00:20:25.460] Oh, yeah, what time is our train tomorrow again?
[00:20:25.460] 对了，我们明天的火车是几点发车来着？
[00:20:26.960] You're like, oh it's this time like we should be getting off at this time
[00:20:26.960] 你会想，哦，现在是时候下车了，我们应该在这个时候下车了。
[00:20:30.360] and the flight leaves at this time.
[00:20:30.360] 航班将于此时起飞。
[00:20:32.360] So we're good.
[00:20:32.360] 一切都好。
[00:20:33.960] No one bats an eye.
[00:20:33.960] 没人觉得奇怪。
[00:20:35.760] No one's like wait, that's like five minutes apart.
[00:20:35.760] 没人会说“等等，这可是相隔五分钟啊”。
[00:20:40.160] Dude, I know that's literally what happened
[00:20:40.160] 老兄，我知道事情就是这样发生的。
[00:20:42.460] and the crazy thing is that whole week that whole last week of the honeymoon.
[00:20:42.460] 更疯狂的是，蜜月的最后一周竟然是整整一周。
[00:20:46.860] I kept checking the flight app to be like,
[00:20:46.860] 我一直查看航班应用程序，心想：
[00:20:49.160] oh maybe we can upgrade to business or like whatever.
[00:20:49.160] 哦，或许我们可以升级到商务版之类的。
[00:20:52.160] So I was constantly looking at the flight info
[00:20:52.160] 所以我一直在查看航班信息。
[00:20:54.860] and then even like night before the train ride to James
[00:20:54.860] 然后甚至就像去詹姆斯的火车之旅前一晚一样。
[00:20:58.360] and I were kind of talking about it
[00:20:58.360] 我当时正在谈论这件事。
[00:20:59.660] and then I remember at one point on the train ride James was like,
[00:20:59.660] 然后我记得在火车上，詹姆斯突然说：
[00:21:02.860] oh how come it says we're supposed to be boarding
[00:21:02.860] 哦，为什么上面显示我们应该登机了？
[00:21:05.360] and then I was like, oh that's just because there's like a time difference
[00:21:05.360] 然后我就想，哦，那只是因为时差的关系。
[00:21:07.560] between London and Paris.
[00:21:07.560] 介于伦敦和巴黎之间。
[00:21:09.560] Then he was like, oh, okay like five minutes later.
[00:21:09.560] 然后过了五分钟，他才恍然大悟地说：“哦，好吧。”
[00:21:11.560] He was like, okay.
[00:21:11.560] 他当时就说，好吧。
[00:21:12.260] No, we are absolutely supposed to be boarding right now.
[00:21:12.260] 不，我们现在绝对应该登机了。
[00:21:17.860] That's so funny.
[00:21:17.860] 太搞笑了。
[00:21:19.460] I was like, how did we not notice until like minute of boarding time?
[00:21:19.460] 我当时就想，怎么直到登机前一分钟我们才注意到？
[00:21:22.960] Oh my God.
[00:21:22.960] 我的天啊。
[00:21:24.260] Okay, but that's a good point.
[00:21:24.260] 好的，不过你说得有道理。
[00:21:25.960] There is a time difference between France and England.
[00:21:25.960] 法国和英国有时差。
[00:21:29.660] So maybe that was throwing you off.
[00:21:29.660] 所以，也许这就是让你分心的原因。
[00:21:31.960] Like maybe you thought you had an hour.
[00:21:31.960] 比如你可能以为自己有一个小时的时间。
[00:21:33.260] True.
[00:21:33.260] 真的。
[00:21:34.160] I don't know.
[00:21:34.160] 我不知道。
[00:21:34.560] I don't even know what happened.
[00:21:34.560] 我甚至不知道发生了什么。
[00:21:35.460] I don't know who that was.
[00:21:35.460] 我不知道那是谁。
[00:21:36.560] That wasn't me.
[00:21:36.560] 那不是我。
[00:21:37.360] I don't claim her.
[00:21:37.360] 我不认她。
[00:21:39.360] Wait, that's so true because you and James are the type to get to the airport
[00:21:39.360] 等等，这话说得太对了，因为你和詹姆斯就是那种会去机场的人。
[00:21:42.860] a little earlier usually.
[00:21:42.860] 通常会稍微早一点。
[00:21:43.960] Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:43.960] 对，没错。
[00:21:46.460] Oh my God.
[00:21:46.460] 我的天啊。
[00:21:47.760] Earlier you were describing how in your mind
[00:21:47.760] 你之前描述过你脑海中的景象
[00:21:51.060] you have kind of like a vision of what a honeymoon is
[00:21:51.060] 你对蜜月应该有一个大致的设想。
[00:21:55.460] and you kind of described it like, you know, being at a resort having
[00:21:55.460] 你刚才描述得好像是在度假一样。
[00:21:58.660] like a relaxing time being by the beach that kind of stuff.
[00:21:58.660] 比如在海边放松一下之类的。
[00:22:01.960] And when you're saying that I was like, oh shit.
[00:22:01.960] 当你这么说的时候，我当时就想，哦，糟了。
[00:22:04.560] I actually have no idea what a honeymoon is supposed to be like.
[00:22:04.560] 我其实完全不知道蜜月应该是什么样子。
[00:22:10.160] Maybe that's better actually because then you can actually morph
[00:22:10.160] 或许那样反而更好，因为那样你就能真正变形了。
[00:22:13.160] the honeymoon into what you want it to be when it comes.
[00:22:13.160] 蜜月期会变成你想要的样子。
[00:22:16.560] Dude, but then I have like no starting point in my mind.
[00:22:16.560] 老兄，可是我脑子里根本没有切入点。
[00:22:20.960] I was like, oh shoot actually like how is a honeymoon different from
[00:22:20.960] 我当时就想，哎呀，蜜月到底和……有什么区别呢？
[00:22:24.660] a trip?
[00:22:24.660] 一次旅行？
[00:22:26.960] Like you do some more romantic things, I guess but then at the same
[00:22:26.960] 比如你会做一些更浪漫的事情，我想，但同时
[00:22:30.160] time like if you're traveling with a significant other it kind of
[00:22:30.160] 比如，如果你和伴侣一起旅行，那感觉就像……
[00:22:34.360] already is romantic in it, you know, like the baseline just because
[00:22:34.360] 它本身就很有浪漫气息，你知道，就像是基本功一样，就因为如此。
[00:22:38.460] it's basically like a very long date.
[00:22:38.460] 这基本上就像一次非常漫长的约会。
[00:22:42.060] That's true.
[00:22:42.060] 这是真的。
[00:22:43.060] That's an interesting question actually and maybe like half the magic
[00:22:43.060] 这确实是个有趣的问题，或许也蕴含着一半的魔力。
[00:22:46.960] is because you just got married.
[00:22:46.960] 因为你刚结婚。
[00:22:48.660] So you're like in your newlywed era and the energy is just like special
[00:22:48.660] 所以你们就像处于新婚阶段，那种感觉特别美好。
[00:22:53.460] in that way.
[00:22:53.460] 那样做。
[00:22:54.260] Yeah, but I guess the way I saw it was if on a regular vacation,
[00:22:54.260] 是的，但我理解的是，如果是在普通的假期里，
[00:22:58.560] it's like I really want to go to this destination with someone I
[00:22:58.560] 我真的很想和某个人一起去这个地方。
[00:23:02.360] love or my closest friends or my family.
[00:23:02.360] 爱人、挚友或家人。
[00:23:04.960] I feel like the honeymoon is more like oh, I am choosing this destination
[00:23:04.960] 我觉得蜜月更像是“哦，我选择这个目的地”。
[00:23:09.560] to be the background for my honeymoon sort of it's like your priority
[00:23:09.560] 成为我蜜月的背景，某种程度上来说，这就像是你的首要任务。
[00:23:13.360] for that trip is your new husband or your new wife or your new partner.
[00:23:13.360] 那次旅行的对象是你的新婚丈夫、新婚妻子或新伴侣。
[00:23:17.560] Yeah, and then the destination is kind of the side character.
[00:23:17.560] 是啊，目的地反而成了配角。
[00:23:21.360] Oh, I think the way you put it makes a lot of sense actually because
[00:23:21.360] 哦，我觉得你这么说确实很有道理，因为
[00:23:25.660] you're right normally traveling.
[00:23:25.660] 你说的没错，通常情况下都是旅行。
[00:23:27.860] It's like the main goal is exploration.
[00:23:27.860] 感觉主要目标就是探索。
[00:23:31.360] Like I have I've never been here or I want to do something in this
[00:23:31.360] 就像我以前从未到过这里一样，或者我想在这里做点什么。
[00:23:34.460] location but a honeymoon is more like the focus is who you're with
[00:23:34.460] 地点固然重要，但蜜月旅行的重点更在于和谁一起度过。
[00:23:40.360] rather than where you're going.
[00:23:40.360] 而不是你要去哪里。
[00:23:42.360] Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:42.360] 对，没错。
[00:23:44.060] And I think with that mindset it totally changed the way that I see
[00:23:44.060] 我认为，正是这种心态彻底改变了我看待事物的方式。
[00:23:48.860] traveling honestly because I feel like you know being someone who
[00:23:48.860] 老实说，我旅行是因为我觉得你知道，作为一个人
[00:23:53.060] went on a ton of like Korean guided group bus tours when I was young
[00:23:53.060] 我小时候参加过很多韩国的旅行团，都是跟团游。
[00:23:57.660] like I feel like there was a very specific idea of traveling in my
[00:23:57.660] 我觉得我心中对旅行有一种非常具体的想法。
[00:24:00.460] head, which was if I go to Spain, I have to see everything in Spain
[00:24:00.460] 我的想法是，如果我去西班牙，我必须把西班牙的所有地方都看完。
[00:24:04.760] that's famous and if not, then why am I even going kind of but this
[00:24:04.760] 那可是很有名的，如果不是，那我干嘛还要来呢？不过话说回来……
[00:24:09.360] time I was like, yeah, what do I want to do?
[00:24:09.360] 当时我就想，是啊，我想做什么呢？
[00:24:12.260] Like what do we want to enjoy and like do here and if that's you know,
[00:24:12.260] 我们想在这里享受什么，想做什么，如果你明白我的意思的话，
[00:24:17.260] staying home one day that's fine.
[00:24:17.260] 在家待一天没关系。
[00:24:18.860] If that's going out to this restaurant, that's fine.
[00:24:18.860] 如果是去这家餐厅吃，那就没问题。
[00:24:21.160] But like what are we feeling and it just felt very like special and
[00:24:21.160] 但我们当时到底是什么感觉？感觉非常特别。
[00:24:26.660] I think that special feeling kind of helped envelope a lot of the
[00:24:26.660] 我认为那种特殊的感觉在某种程度上帮助笼罩了很多人。
[00:24:30.560] trip because you know when you go to Europe like people say some
[00:24:30.560] 去欧洲旅行，因为你知道，就像人们常说的那样……
[00:24:33.460] racist shit sometimes I think a lot of people when they travel they
[00:24:33.460] 有时候我觉得很多人旅行的时候都会遇到种族歧视之类的事情。
[00:24:36.860] experience that regardless of where they go, but even stuff like
[00:24:36.860] 无论他们去哪里，都会有这样的体验，即使是像
[00:24:40.460] that that we experienced.
[00:24:40.460] 我们所经历的。
[00:24:41.560] I feel like James and I were just like cracking up about it the whole
[00:24:41.560] 我觉得我和詹姆斯当时都笑得前仰后合，整个过程都充满了笑声。
[00:24:43.860] trip and I was like dude, this is honeymoon buff right here.
[00:24:43.860] 这次旅行，我当时就想，老兄，这简直就是蜜月旅行的完美写照。
[00:24:47.560] Nothing can hurt you on your honeymoon.
[00:24:47.560] 蜜月期间，什么事都不会伤害你。
[00:24:53.560] But I think in that way my learning from the honeymoon was I feel
[00:24:53.560] 但我认为，从蜜月旅行中我学到的最重要的一点是，我感觉
[00:24:57.760] like this sort of energy can be very carefully preserved and applied
[00:24:57.760] 这种能量可以被非常谨慎地保存和利用。
[00:25:01.860] to a lot of different types of vacations and travels whether it's
[00:25:01.860] 适用于各种不同类型的假期和旅行，无论是
[00:25:05.460] with your husband or wife or not and I was like, I just need to
[00:25:05.460] 无论有没有丈夫或妻子，我当时就想，我只需要
[00:25:09.460] channel my like honeymoon self in other vacations and like, you know
[00:25:09.460] 在其他假期里，我会像过蜜月一样，你知道的。
[00:25:13.960] enjoy it more and feel more in tune with what I want.
[00:25:13.960] 更享受生活，也更能了解自己想要什么。
[00:25:16.660] Mm-hmm.
[00:25:16.660] 嗯。
[00:25:17.360] I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:25:17.360] 我觉得这很有道理。
[00:25:19.160] We've kind of mentioned it before on the pod how like the way that
[00:25:19.160] 我们之前在播客里也提到过，就是那种方式。
[00:25:23.160] we've traveled when we were younger and like you just mentioned too
[00:25:23.160] 我们年轻的时候也旅行过，就像你刚才提到的那样。
[00:25:26.660] it's like we go to a place and we're like, oh my god, we're here.
[00:25:26.660] 就像我们去到一个地方，然后我们会想，我的天哪，我们到这儿了。
[00:25:29.660] We need to hit everything and I guess now that travel is like so
[00:25:29.660] 我们需要去所有地方，我想现在旅行就是这样了。
[00:25:33.860] much more accessible in comparison to when we were younger.
[00:25:33.860] 与我们年轻的时候相比，现在更容易实现了。
[00:25:37.460] We're starting to learn and understand our own travel habits versus
[00:25:37.460] 我们开始了解和理解我们自身的旅行习惯与他人的旅行习惯之间的差异。
[00:25:43.760] like our parents that we have, you know grown up on in the past.
[00:25:43.760] 就像我们过去看着长大的父母那样。
[00:25:48.560] So I think that is definitely something I can relate to as well
[00:25:48.560] 所以我觉得这一点我肯定也能感同身受。
[00:25:51.960] and we've also talked about this before how we are kind of similar
[00:25:51.960] 我们之前也讨论过，我们其实挺相似的。
[00:25:55.860] where we're like, okay, let's not actually pack our schedules too
[00:25:55.860] 我们当时的想法是，好吧，那我们就别把日程安排得太满了。
[00:25:58.860] much because we're realizing that if we pack our schedules too
[00:25:58.860] 很大程度上是因为我们意识到，如果我们把日程安排得太满……
[00:26:03.260] much we are just gonna like burn out by the end and hate everyone.
[00:26:03.260] 到最后我们很可能会筋疲力尽，恨透所有人。
[00:26:10.260] Exactly and I feel like especially on a honeymoon that is
[00:26:10.260] 没错，我觉得尤其是在蜜月期间更是如此。
[00:26:13.660] not the goal.
[00:26:13.660] 这不是目标。
[00:26:16.460] Yeah, I think our itinerary was fairly loose with maybe like a
[00:26:16.460] 是的，我觉得我们的行程安排相当宽松，可能就像……
[00:26:19.860] couple of things to do each day and it's really more like guidelines
[00:26:19.860] 每天要做几件事，其实更像是一些指导原则。
[00:26:23.160] and whatnot.
[00:26:23.160] 等等。
[00:26:23.860] But what I did find very funny was you Crystal and your boyfriend
[00:26:23.860] 但我发现最搞笑的是你，克丽丝特尔和你的男朋友
[00:26:28.360] went to like two of the three locations that James and I did I
[00:26:28.360] 我去了詹姆斯和我去过的三个地方中的两个。
[00:26:33.160] think literally like a month or maybe even less before we went
[00:26:33.160] 想想看，就在我们出发前一个月，甚至可能更短的时间。
[00:26:36.760] on our honeymoon.
[00:26:36.760] 在我们的蜜月旅行中。
[00:26:38.060] So the cool part of that was when I was watching your guys's
[00:26:38.060] 所以最酷的部分就是我看你们的……
[00:26:41.260] stories.
[00:26:41.260] 故事。
[00:26:41.760] I was like, this is like a preview of what we're going to do in
[00:26:41.760] 我当时就想，这就像是我们将要做的事情的预演。
[00:26:44.060] like two weeks and then also for a split second before we knew
[00:26:44.060] 大概过了两周，然后就在我们意识到之前，还有一瞬间的那种感觉。
[00:26:49.160] like the exact dates we were traveling.
[00:26:49.160] 例如我们旅行的确切日期。
[00:26:51.460] I remember I was like, oh my god Crystal like me and James might
[00:26:51.460] 我记得当时我就想，哦我的天哪，克里斯托就像我和詹姆斯一样。
[00:26:53.960] be in Paris and London on our honeymoon.
[00:26:53.960] 我们的蜜月旅行将在巴黎和伦敦进行。
[00:26:56.360] Like maybe we should meet up and I remember you were like you
[00:26:56.360] 比如，也许我们应该见个面，我记得你以前是这样的……
[00:26:58.760] want to meet up with me on your honeymoon.
[00:26:58.760] 你想在蜜月旅行时和我见面吗？
[00:27:02.260] I was like, is that allowed?
[00:27:02.260] 我当时就想，这样做可以吗？
[00:27:05.160] Dude and also a close coworker of mine who lives across the
[00:27:05.160] 哥们儿，还有我的一个关系很好的同事，他住在对面
[00:27:09.160] US so I never get to see her in person.
[00:27:09.160] 因为我在美国，所以我从来没机会见到她本人。
[00:27:11.360] She was also in Paris and London the same times I was and I
[00:27:11.360] 她和我同时期也在巴黎和伦敦，而且
[00:27:15.860] briefly considered I was like should I be like we should meet
[00:27:15.860] 我短暂地考虑了一下，心想我应该说我们应该见面吗？
[00:27:18.560] up and then I'll say no that's like low-key curse.
[00:27:18.560] 然后我会说不，那就像是一种隐晦的诅咒。
[00:27:23.720] Oh my god.
[00:27:23.720] 我的天啊。
[00:27:24.620] Okay.
[00:27:24.620] 好的。
[00:27:24.920] I also feel like London and Paris are the destinations of the
[00:27:24.920] 我也觉得伦敦和巴黎是理想的旅行目的地。
[00:27:28.620] year.
[00:27:28.620] 年。
[00:27:29.420] Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:27:29.420] 是的，我完全同意。
[00:27:31.020] I've already seen a bunch of friends go and when I was there
[00:27:31.020] 我已经看到很多朋友去了，而且我当时也在那里。
[00:27:34.720] at least two or three of my friends were also in like London
[00:27:34.720] 我的至少两三个朋友当时也在伦敦。
[00:27:38.520] and Paris at the same time that I was there.
[00:27:38.520] 当时我也在巴黎。
[00:27:40.420] So I met up with like a few of them and I was like, oh my god
[00:27:40.420] 所以我跟其中几个人见了面，然后我就想，我的天哪
[00:27:42.920] is crazy.
[00:27:42.920] 太疯狂了。
[00:27:44.020] Yeah, and then I did think to like you and James.
[00:27:44.020] 是的，然后我确实想过要喜欢你和詹姆斯。
[00:27:47.320] I was like wow if I were Jisoo and James right now, there's
[00:27:47.320] 我当时就想，哇，如果我现在是Jisoo和James，那该多好啊……
[00:27:50.520] no way I would be meeting up with people.
[00:27:50.520] 我绝对不会和人见面。
[00:27:53.320] That's so funny.
[00:27:53.320] 太搞笑了。
[00:27:54.220] Yeah, actually when we were traveling to I remember seeing
[00:27:54.220] 是的，实际上，当我们旅行的时候，我记得看到过
[00:27:56.620] like at least one or two people just mutuals on Instagram who
[00:27:56.620] 比如至少有一两个人只是Instagram上的互关好友
[00:27:59.720] are also in London and Paris at similar times but that kind
[00:27:59.720] 他们也差不多同时在伦敦和巴黎，但那种情况
[00:28:03.420] of reminds me of one thing that I consciously did on our
[00:28:03.420] 这让我想起我曾有意识地做过的一件事。
[00:28:06.720] honeymoon that I think is different from our regular traveling
[00:28:06.720] 我觉得这次蜜月旅行和我们平时的旅行很不一样。
[00:28:10.320] which is staying off social media and I think usually my
[00:28:10.320] 那就是远离社交媒体，而且我认为通常我的
[00:28:14.920] urge when I travel is to post at least snippets here and there.
[00:28:14.920] 我旅行时的一个冲动就是时不时地在这里发布一些片段。
[00:28:18.720] I'm pretty inconsistent about it, but usually I'll post at
[00:28:18.720] 我在这方面不太规律，但通常我会在……发布
[00:28:21.520] least like a story or two about where I'm at what I'm eating
[00:28:21.520] 至少可以写一两篇关于我在哪里、吃什么的故事。
[00:28:25.920] etc.
[00:28:25.920] ETC。
[00:28:27.020] But this time I snapped a ton of photos but didn't post anything
[00:28:27.020] 但这次我拍了很多照片，却一张也没发。
[00:28:31.620] not even a single story actually and then I also checked
[00:28:31.620] 实际上连一个故事都没有，然后我又查了一下。
[00:28:37.020] Messenger and like text messages and stuff a lot less than
[00:28:37.020] Messenger 和短信之类的东西使用频率远低于
[00:28:40.720] I normally would and I think that contributed to a lot of
[00:28:40.720] 我通常会这样做，我认为这促成了很多事情。
[00:28:44.520] the honeymoon feeling too where I was kind of like, okay, I'm
[00:28:44.520] 那种蜜月期的感觉也挺强烈的，我当时就想，好吧，我
[00:28:47.120] taking PTO from life.
[00:28:47.120] 从生活中抽身出来。
[00:28:50.620] Also, I think that's a good way to keep the focus on just you
[00:28:50.620] 而且，我认为这是让大家只关注你的好方法。
[00:28:55.120] and James like, you know, this time is like just you two and
[00:28:55.120] 詹姆斯说，你知道，这次就只有你们两个人。
[00:28:59.120] you're not sharing it with the world or with your friends.
[00:28:59.120] 你既没有与全世界分享，也没有与朋友分享。
[00:29:02.020] It's just like truly your private time your like honeymoon.
[00:29:02.020] 这就像你们的蜜月一样，完全属于你们的私人时间。
[00:29:07.620] Yeah, I know it felt like weirdly very very special and I say
[00:29:07.620] 是的，我知道，感觉非常非常特别，非常奇妙，我说
[00:29:11.520] weirdly because I don't know like there's nothing that special
[00:29:11.520] 很奇怪，因为我不知道，好像也没什么特别的。
[00:29:14.920] about not posting on Instagram yet.
[00:29:14.920] 关于我还没有在Instagram上发帖这件事。
[00:29:16.920] It's still like the impact was pretty big for me.
[00:29:16.920] 这件事对我的影响仍然很大。
[00:29:20.020] I can totally understand that plus like imagine you're posting
[00:29:20.020] 我完全能理解，就像想象一下你在发帖一样。
[00:29:23.620] and then maybe your friends comment like oh my god, so cute
[00:29:23.620] 然后你的朋友可能会评论说，哦我的天，太可爱了
[00:29:26.620] like are you on your honeymoon and then you know, you have to
[00:29:26.620] 比如，你们在度蜜月，然后你知道，你们就得……
[00:29:29.420] go answer them and then it just like takes more time away from
[00:29:29.420] 去回答这些问题，然后就会占用更多时间。
[00:29:33.320] the time that you're spending together.
[00:29:33.320] 你们在一起的时间。
[00:29:35.220] Also, it's like this is your private memory like you don't
[00:29:35.220] 而且，这就像是你自己的私人记忆，你并不……
[00:29:38.520] have to share it with everyone not everyone needs to know what
[00:29:38.520] 必须与所有人分享，但并非每个人都需要知道。
[00:29:41.820] you did on your honeymoon.
[00:29:41.820] 你们蜜月旅行的时候做了。
[00:29:44.620] That makes it sound like I did some like secret shit.
[00:29:44.620] 那听起来好像我做了什么见不得人的勾当似的。
[00:29:48.120] You know, I just mean like, you know,
[00:29:48.120] 你知道，我的意思是，你知道，
[00:29:53.220] like it's your private memory.
[00:29:53.220] 就像这是你的私人记忆一样。
[00:29:59.420] They don't need to follow you across Europe.
[00:29:59.420] 他们不需要跟着你穿越整个欧洲。
[00:30:02.320] That's true.
[00:30:02.320] 这是真的。
[00:30:03.520] And I don't think everyone experiences this but sometimes
[00:30:03.520] 我不认为每个人都会经历这种情况，但有时
[00:30:06.520] for me like when I do post on social media through my vacation,
[00:30:06.520] 对我来说，就像我在度假期间在社交媒体上发帖一样，
[00:30:10.720] I might be thinking like oh what would look good on Instagram
[00:30:10.720] 我可能会想，哦，什么东西在Instagram上看起来会很好看。
[00:30:13.820] or like what would get more engagement and things like that.
[00:30:13.820] 或者说，怎样才能获得更多参与度等等。
[00:30:16.520] So then I think snapping photos just private photos did help
[00:30:16.520] 所以我觉得，拍一些私人照片确实有帮助。
[00:30:20.620] me feel like I wasn't thinking about that stuff.
[00:30:20.620] 我感觉自己当时根本没想过那些事。
[00:30:24.120] I also think from my personal experiences if you're traveling
[00:30:24.120] 根据我的个人经验，我也认为如果你要旅行的话。
[00:30:28.820] if you're traveling alone, you don't have that like steady
[00:30:28.820] 如果你独自旅行，你就没有那种稳定的环境。
[00:30:32.020] person who's traveling with you who can provide interaction
[00:30:32.020] 与你同行且能提供互动的人
[00:30:36.520] with you whenever you need it or want it.
[00:30:36.520] 无论何时你需要它或想要它，它都会在你身边。
[00:30:39.520] So then posting on social media is like another way of interacting
[00:30:39.520] 所以，在社交媒体上发帖就像是另一种互动方式。
[00:30:43.620] with people.
[00:30:43.620] 与人相处。
[00:30:44.320] That's true.
[00:30:44.320] 这是真的。
[00:30:44.920] So then I do notice that like me traveling with people in general
[00:30:44.920] 所以，我注意到，就像我和其他人一起旅行一样。
[00:30:50.420] versus alone social media usage increases more when I'm alone.
[00:30:50.420] 与独自一人时相比，我独自一人时使用社交媒体的频率更高。
[00:30:55.720] That's a good point.
[00:30:55.720] 说得有道理。
[00:30:56.420] Actually, I've never like really solo traveled so I wouldn't
[00:30:56.420] 其实，我从来没有真正独自旅行过，所以我不会……
[00:30:59.820] understand the feeling but I think you're right.
[00:30:59.820] 我理解你的感受，但我认为你是对的。
[00:31:01.820] Like there's a lot of enjoyment that comes from sharing like
[00:31:01.820] 分享能带来很多乐趣，比如
[00:31:04.720] where you're at which is why usually on vacations.
[00:31:04.720] 你所在的地方，所以通常是在度假的时候。
[00:31:07.820] I love to like post about it and whatnot so I can see how it
[00:31:07.820] 我喜欢发帖分享相关内容，这样就能看到大家的反应了。
[00:31:11.020] can fill that void when you're wanting some sort of interaction
[00:31:11.020] 当你渴望某种互动时，它可以填补这种空白。
[00:31:14.920] on solo travels.
[00:31:14.920] 独自旅行。
[00:31:16.220] Yeah, because sometimes you're like, oh my god, this food is
[00:31:16.220] 是啊，因为有时候你会想，我的天哪，这食物……
[00:31:19.020] so good and then the world needs to know or just the person
[00:31:19.020] 太好了，全世界都需要知道，或者只是让这个人知道。
[00:31:25.120] who I'm traveling with, you know?
[00:31:25.120] 你知道，我是和谁一起旅行的？
[00:31:26.120] True.
[00:31:26.120] 真的。
[00:31:28.220] Like someone needs to know and whether it's forced down their
[00:31:28.220] 好像有人需要知道，以及这是否是被迫接受的。
[00:31:31.920] throat because they're with me or if it's, you know, just put
[00:31:31.920] 喉咙，因为他们和我在一起，或者如果是，你知道，就放
[00:31:36.520] out there into the world as long as it has been released.
[00:31:36.520] 只要它已经发行，它就一直存在于世界各地。
[00:31:42.320] Well besides taking photos as keepsakes from your honeymoon,
[00:31:42.320] 除了拍摄蜜月照片留作纪念之外，
[00:31:46.520] was there any other way that you tried to like memorialize
[00:31:46.520] 你有没有尝试过其他方式来纪念他？
[00:31:50.420] the trip?
[00:31:50.420] 这次旅行？
[00:31:51.320] Yes, so I guess I kept going back to this idea of like, okay,
[00:31:51.320] 是的，所以我想我一直在思考这个问题，就像，好吧，
[00:31:56.420] this is like the honeymoon, you know, the once-in-a-lifetime
[00:31:56.420] 这就像蜜月一样，你知道，一生一次。
[00:32:00.520] allegedly honeymoon star.
[00:32:00.520] 据称是蜜月明星。
[00:32:05.630] I kept feeling like one, the photos that we took I needed to
[00:32:05.630] 我一直感觉自己像个傻瓜，我们需要拍那些照片。
[00:32:11.230] look really good and I think in the past like traveling and
[00:32:11.230] 看起来真不错，而且我觉得过去我喜欢旅行。
[00:32:15.230] stuff.
[00:32:15.230] 东西。
[00:32:15.530] I obviously would try to have nice outfits or whatnot.
[00:32:15.530] 我当然会尽量穿得漂亮些什么的。
[00:32:18.130] But this time I was like, okay, I'm going to bring all my
[00:32:18.130] 但这次我想，好吧，我要把我的所有东西都带来。
[00:32:20.830] skirts.
[00:32:20.830] 裙子。
[00:32:21.530] I'll bring my nice shoes.
[00:32:21.530] 我会带上我的漂亮鞋子。
[00:32:22.830] I'll like really dress up buy new clothes and whatnot for
[00:32:22.830] 我喜欢好好打扮一番，买些新衣服什么的。
[00:32:25.830] this trip.
[00:32:25.830] 这次旅行。
[00:32:26.330] So yeah, I really before the trip went out and bought new
[00:32:26.330] 是的，在旅行前我真的出去买了新的
[00:32:29.530] jeans, new cardigans, etc.
[00:32:29.530] 牛仔裤、新款开衫等等。
[00:32:32.430] For some unknown reason but the flip side of that was when
[00:32:32.430] 出于某种未知的原因，但另一方面是当
[00:32:36.930] we were actually on our honeymoon same thought like I was
[00:32:36.930] 我们当时其实正在度蜜月，我的想法跟你一样。
[00:32:40.130] like, this is the honeymoon blah blah blah.
[00:32:40.130] 比如，这是蜜月旅行，等等等等。
[00:32:42.530] I kept having this urge to like buy stuff and I would like
[00:32:42.530] 我一直很想买东西，而且我也想买。
[00:32:45.830] pick something up something like a Christmas ornament or
[00:32:45.830] 买点东西，比如圣诞装饰品之类的。
[00:32:48.430] like a magnet or something and I'll turn to James and be
[00:32:48.430] 就像磁铁一样，我会转向詹姆斯，然后……
[00:32:50.430] like, oh my god, like we have to buy this and then this could
[00:32:50.430] 天哪，我们得买这个，然后这可能会
[00:32:53.130] be like the ornament or like the magnet we bought on our
[00:32:53.130] 就像我们买的装饰品或磁铁一样
[00:32:56.130] honeymoon.
[00:32:56.130] 蜜月。
[00:32:57.230] Then James is like, I don't know like that thing looks kind
[00:32:57.230] 然后詹姆斯说，我不知道，那东西看起来有点……
[00:32:59.830] of fragile like, you know, I don't know if we want to bring
[00:32:59.830] 就像脆弱一样，你知道，我不知道我们是否想带来
[00:33:02.330] something so big or so fragile like back to the US.
[00:33:02.330] 像回到美国这样规模庞大或极其脆弱的事情。
[00:33:05.130] I'd be like but this is our honeymoon.
[00:33:05.130] 我会说，但这可是我们的蜜月啊。
[00:33:06.930] Like we have to document it somehow.
[00:33:06.930] 好像我们得想办法把它记录下来。
[00:33:10.630] So then it's similar to that urge of like I need to tell everyone
[00:33:10.630] 所以，这跟那种“我必须告诉所有人”的冲动很相似。
[00:33:14.330] we're on our honeymoon and get as much free stuff.
[00:33:14.330] 我们正在度蜜月，可以得到很多免费的东西。
[00:33:16.430] Like I felt like I was constantly searching for like the
[00:33:16.430] 感觉自己好像一直在寻找……
[00:33:19.330] thing to buy so that I could tell our children or whoever
[00:33:19.330] 买点东西，这样我就可以告诉我的孩子或者其他人了。
[00:33:23.030] in the future like I bought this on our honeymoon.
[00:33:23.030] 将来就像我在蜜月旅行时买的那样。
[00:33:28.230] I'm imagining like you guys walk into some sort of art gallery
[00:33:28.230] 我想象着你们走进某个美术馆的情景。
[00:33:32.930] and you see this giant piece of art.
[00:33:32.930] 然后你就会看到这件巨大的艺术品。
[00:33:34.730] You're like we have to get this it'll be the centerpiece
[00:33:34.730] 你会说，我们必须得到这个，它将成为焦点。
[00:33:37.930] for our living room.
[00:33:37.930] 放在我们客厅里。
[00:33:38.930] And whenever someone asks or like it's from our honeymoon.
[00:33:38.930] 每当有人问起或说这是我们的蜜月旅行照片时。
[00:33:43.530] Wait, literally that is like pretty much me just constantly
[00:33:43.530] 等等，这简直就是我本人经常做的事。
[00:33:47.230] bothering James like we have to buy this.
[00:33:47.230] 烦着詹姆斯，好像我们必须买这个似的。
[00:33:49.530] He's like, please he's like, how will we bring it back?
[00:33:49.530] 他就像，求求你，他就像，我们该如何把它找回来？
[00:33:57.390] Okay.
[00:33:57.390] 好的。
[00:33:58.090] Also the worst part of this is the two things that I mentioned
[00:33:58.090] 而这件事最糟糕的地方就在于我提到的那两件事。
[00:34:01.290] about buying stuff counteracts each other because as you can
[00:34:01.290] 关于购物的种种想法相互抵消，因为正如你所看到的……
[00:34:04.490] imagine if I'm trying to have this nice wardrobe and all these
[00:34:04.490] 想象一下，如果我想要拥有一个漂亮的衣橱，以及所有这些……
[00:34:08.390] outfits and whatnot for the honeymoon our luggages were like
[00:34:08.390] 我们的行李里装满了蜜月旅行的衣服和其他东西，就像……
[00:34:12.090] packed.
[00:34:12.090] 打包好了。
[00:34:13.090] We brought one carry-on and one checked bag and both things
[00:34:13.090] 我们带了一件随身行李和一件托运行李，两样东西都带齐了。
[00:34:16.490] were like pretty full already.
[00:34:16.490] 我们当时已经很饱了。
[00:34:18.390] And then anytime I wanted to like buy stuff James would be
[00:34:18.390] 然后，每当我想要买东西的时候，詹姆斯都会……
[00:34:20.990] like, I don't even think we have like any room to bring shit
[00:34:20.990] 我觉得我们甚至都没地方放东西了。
[00:34:25.090] back.
[00:34:25.090] 后退。
[00:34:27.390] So it was truly my two demons like battling each other.
[00:34:27.390] 所以，这简直就像是我内心的两个恶魔在互相搏斗。
[00:34:31.990] He's like we're gonna need another suitcase pretty much.
[00:34:31.990] 他说，我们大概还需要另一个行李箱。
[00:34:36.490] But did you end up buying some sort of souvenir?
[00:34:36.490] 但你最后有没有买纪念品呢？
[00:34:41.390] So James didn't end up buying me some nice stuff from Paris,
[00:34:41.390] 所以詹姆斯最终并没有从巴黎给我买什么好东西。
[00:34:44.190] which was awesome two bags, which will be my honeymoon bags
[00:34:44.190] 太棒了，有两个包，这将是我的蜜月包。
[00:34:47.690] forever.
[00:34:47.690] 永远。
[00:34:48.690] And I really wanted to buy James stuff actually, but he is
[00:34:48.690] 我其实很想给詹姆斯买东西，但他……
[00:34:52.290] very much the type to not have any interest in something unless
[00:34:52.290] 他属于那种除非对某件事感兴趣，否则对其他任何事都不感兴趣的人。
[00:34:55.890] he absolutely loves it and then he'll have like complete
[00:34:55.890] 他非常喜欢，然后他就会完全沉浸其中。
[00:34:58.990] dedication to the item.
[00:34:58.990] 对物品的投入。
[00:35:00.690] So when we're shopping around he didn't really find much that
[00:35:00.690] 所以当我们四处逛逛的时候，他并没有真正找到什么合适的东西。
[00:35:03.290] he liked but yeah now I have two things that I can call my
[00:35:03.290] 他喜欢，但现在我有两样东西可以称之为我的
[00:35:07.490] honeymoon souvenirs.
[00:35:07.490] 蜜月纪念品。
[00:35:08.990] Dude, it's okay.
[00:35:08.990] 兄弟，没事的。
[00:35:09.690] So you have two bags one for you and the other one James can
[00:35:09.690] 所以你有两个包，一个给你自己，另一个给詹姆斯。
[00:35:13.990] claim like you'll still be wearing it and using it but James
[00:35:13.990] 詹姆斯声称你还会继续佩戴和使用它。
[00:35:18.390] can be like, oh yeah, that's my souvenir.
[00:35:18.390] 可能会说，哦，对，那是我的纪念品。
[00:35:23.690] True or his souvenir could be my happiness.
[00:35:23.690] 没错，或者说他的纪念品可能就是我的幸福。
[00:35:29.490] Ooh, okay.
[00:35:29.490] 哦，好的。
[00:35:30.190] Another question is because you know, it's like your honeymoon
[00:35:30.190] 另一个问题是，你知道，这就像你们的蜜月一样。
[00:35:34.590] and the focus is you and James spending time together.
[00:35:34.590] 重点是你和詹姆斯一起度过时光。
[00:35:39.290] Did you or did you not try to buy little souvenirs for friends
[00:35:39.290] 你有没有试着给朋友们买小纪念品？
[00:35:43.890] and family because I know that's something that you and James
[00:35:43.890] 还有家人，因为我知道这是你和詹姆斯都非常重视的事情。
[00:35:46.890] often do when you go on trips.
[00:35:46.890] 旅行时经常这样做。
[00:35:48.890] We did not stuff for you to actually we try to be like pretty
[00:35:48.890] 我们没有给你准备任何东西，实际上我们努力做到漂亮
[00:35:53.390] strategic about it of like, you know, when we see the like the
[00:35:53.390] 从战略角度来看，你知道，当我们看到类似这样的情况时……
[00:35:57.390] thing that we feel like is right just buy it versus I feel like
[00:35:57.390] 我们觉得对的事情就买，而不是我觉得……
[00:36:00.190] in other vacations.
[00:36:00.190] 在其他假期。
[00:36:01.490] Sometimes we like deliberate about it and whatnot.
[00:36:01.490] 有时候我们喜欢刻意去做这件事等等。
[00:36:04.490] We definitely did pick up stuff for our friends and family.
[00:36:04.490] 我们确实给朋友和家人买了一些东西。
[00:36:07.090] Wow, that's nice.
[00:36:07.090] 哇，真不错。
[00:36:08.490] I thought you two would be like no we will forego this this time,
[00:36:08.490] 我以为你们两个会说“不，这次我们放弃吧”，
[00:36:12.190] you know, we'll totally focus on ourselves and we don't need
[00:36:12.190] 你知道，我们会完全专注于自身，我们不需要
[00:36:15.890] to think about our friends and family this time.
[00:36:15.890] 在这个时候，请想想我们的朋友和家人。
[00:36:19.490] I mean the stuff we bought isn't big but I think it's pretty
[00:36:19.490] 我的意思是，我们买的东西虽然不多，但我认为还不错。
[00:36:22.590] similar to what we usually buy for friends and family ish.
[00:36:22.590] 跟我们平时给亲朋好友买的东西差不多。
[00:36:25.590] What I will say is that a part of me really wanted to get
[00:36:25.590] 我想说的是，我内心深处真的很想得到
[00:36:28.590] something special for like our parents.
[00:36:28.590] 送给像父母这样的人的特别礼物。
[00:36:31.090] There was one thing in particular that I really want to buy
[00:36:31.090] 我特别想买一样东西。
[00:36:33.490] which didn't end up working out because of inventory, but I
[00:36:33.490] 因为库存问题，最终没能成功，但我
[00:36:36.490] wanted to buy a little music box from Switzerland for my dad
[00:36:36.490] 我想从瑞士买个小音乐盒送给我爸爸。
[00:36:40.390] which had the tune of like our father-daughter dance song,
[00:36:40.390] 它的旋律就像我们父女俩跳舞时唱的那首歌一样。
[00:36:44.690] which is such a good idea.
[00:36:44.690] 这真是个好主意。
[00:36:45.890] Yeah, I might order it off like Amazon or some shit.
[00:36:45.890] 是啊，我可能会从亚马逊之类的网站上订购。
[00:36:50.690] Yeah, you can still give the gift but it just won't be from
[00:36:50.690] 是的，你仍然可以送礼物，只是礼物不会再是出自你之手了。
[00:36:53.190] Switzerland.
[00:36:53.190] 瑞士。
[00:36:54.190] Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:54.190] 对，没错。
[00:36:56.190] But yeah, I think just there were certain things that I feel
[00:36:56.190] 但是，是的，我觉得有些事情我确实有这种感觉。
[00:36:59.890] like I was thinking about a lot on our trip, which was really
[00:36:59.890] 就像我在旅行途中想了很多事情一样，那次旅行真的
[00:37:02.990] like our family.
[00:37:02.990] 就像我们家一样。
[00:37:04.990] I felt like I was constantly like thinking oh, I need to show
[00:37:04.990] 我感觉自己一直在想，哦，我需要展示一下
[00:37:07.490] my mom this photo later.
[00:37:07.490] 我妈妈后来拍了这张照片。
[00:37:09.090] And then I know James was sending his parents photos on WeChat
[00:37:09.090] 然后我知道詹姆斯在微信上给他父母发照片。
[00:37:13.590] and stuff throughout the trip too.
[00:37:13.590] 旅途中还有很多其他事情。
[00:37:15.090] Aw, that's nice.
[00:37:15.090] 哇，真好。
[00:37:16.390] And I feel like if there's anyone to share photos with on your
[00:37:16.390] 我觉得如果有人可以和你分享照片的话……
[00:37:19.390] honeymoon, it's definitely like family.
[00:37:19.390] 蜜月旅行，感觉就像和家人在一起一样。
[00:37:21.690] And this is like low-key a little weird but for some reason
[00:37:21.690] 这感觉有点奇怪，但不知为何
[00:37:24.490] when like periodically throughout our honeymoon, I kept thinking
[00:37:24.490] 就像我们蜜月期间时不时发生的那样，我一直在想……
[00:37:27.990] about my parents on their honeymoon and my parents went to
[00:37:27.990] 关于我父母的蜜月旅行，我父母去了
[00:37:30.990] Guam for like maybe a week or so for their honeymoon.
[00:37:30.990] 他们大概在关岛度蜜月一周左右。
[00:37:35.590] They kind of laughed when I said our honeymoon was two weeks.
[00:37:35.590] 当我说我们的蜜月只有两周时，他们都笑了。
[00:37:38.790] They were like, oh kids nowadays.
[00:37:38.790] 他们当时就说：“哎，现在的孩子啊。”
[00:37:40.190] They travel for so long, but it made me feel like weirdly
[00:37:40.190] 他们旅行了那么久，但这让我感觉很奇怪。
[00:37:43.890] emotional thinking about our parents on their honeymoon.
[00:37:43.890] 想起父母的蜜月旅行，不禁浮想联翩。
[00:37:48.890] I kept thinking about how different probably the styles of
[00:37:48.890] 我一直在想，这些风格可能会有多么不同……
[00:37:53.090] our trips would have been just because I think with the life
[00:37:53.090] 我们的旅行本来只是因为我觉得生活如此美好。
[00:37:55.990] that my parents were able to provide and whatnot, like I just
[00:37:55.990] 我父母能够提供的一切等等，就像我只是
[00:37:59.690] probably have access to different types of traveling now, but
[00:37:59.690] 现在或许可以选择不同的旅行方式，但是
[00:38:03.690] also imagining them at like our age with this feeling of like
[00:38:03.690] 想象他们和我们一样大的时候，也会有这种感觉……
[00:38:08.590] oh now we're going to like tackle the world together.
[00:38:08.590] 哦，现在我们要一起征服世界了。
[00:38:11.190] I just kept thinking we're like the same, you know, like I
[00:38:11.190] 我一直在想，我们就像同一个人，你知道吗，就像我
[00:38:14.490] am my parents now.
[00:38:14.490] 我现在是我的父母。
[00:38:16.090] Wow.
[00:38:16.090] 哇。
[00:38:17.490] I wonder if my parents went on a honeymoon before because I
[00:38:17.490] 我想知道我的父母之前是否度过蜜月，因为我
[00:38:20.990] think my parents they got married and then they like were
[00:38:20.990] 我想我父母结婚后，他们就像……
[00:38:24.090] like, all right, it's time to immigrate.
[00:38:24.090] 好吧，是时候移民了。
[00:38:26.890] They got shit to do.
[00:38:26.890] 他们有很多事要做。
[00:38:29.590] No rest for us.
[00:38:29.590] 我们没有休息的时间。
[00:38:32.790] Yeah, I do feel like the concept of a honeymoon was maybe a
[00:38:32.790] 是的，我觉得蜜月的概念或许曾经是……
[00:38:35.690] little bit more like relaxed back then.
[00:38:35.690] 那时候感觉更放松一些。
[00:38:37.990] Yeah, and Asia in general was just kind of a different environment
[00:38:37.990] 是的，而且亚洲整体环境也确实不太一样。
[00:38:41.390] during our parents time.
[00:38:41.390] 在我们父母那一代。
[00:38:42.590] True.
[00:38:42.590] 真的。
[00:38:43.090] Plus their traditions and stuff are not always going to be the
[00:38:43.090] 而且他们的传统之类的东西并不总是会一直存在。
[00:38:46.190] same, right?
[00:38:46.190] 一样，对吧？
[00:38:47.990] But I'm so glad to hear that your honeymoon went so well.
[00:38:47.990] 但我很高兴听到你们的蜜月旅行非常顺利。
[00:38:51.390] It sounds like you really set an intention for it and you
[00:38:51.390] 听起来你确实为此设定了一个目标，而且你
[00:38:55.690] accomplished that, you know feeling really connected with
[00:38:55.690] 做到了这一点，你知道，感觉与……真正建立了联系
[00:38:58.190] each other and focusing on that postmarital bliss even though
[00:38:58.190] 彼此相爱，专注于婚后的幸福，即使
[00:39:03.790] it's four months later.
[00:39:03.790] 四个月后。
[00:39:05.190] I still get like a year right to be called a newlywed.
[00:39:05.190] 我还有大约一年的时间可以被称为新婚夫妇。
[00:39:10.290] Yeah, honestly considering that like you'll probably be married
[00:39:10.290] 是啊，说实话，考虑到你可能已经结婚了。
[00:39:14.490] for the rest of your life.
[00:39:14.490] 余生都将如此。
[00:39:16.290] You can probably be called a newlywed for at least like three
[00:39:16.290] 你大概至少可以被称为新婚夫妇三年左右。
[00:39:19.790] or four years.
[00:39:19.790] 或四年。
[00:39:22.190] Wait true percentage wise, right?
[00:39:22.190] 等等，这是按实际百分比计算的，对吧？
[00:39:24.690] We can milk this for a little longer.
[00:39:24.690] 我们可以再利用一段时间。
[00:39:26.490] Yeah, like for as long as a toddler is a toddler you are a
[00:39:26.490] 是啊，就像只要幼儿还是幼儿，你就是……
[00:39:30.490] newlywed.
[00:39:30.490] 新人。
[00:39:31.490] Until we hit marriage preschool.
[00:39:31.490] 直到我们进入婚姻幼儿园。
[00:39:35.690] Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:39:35.690] 是的，一切准备就绪。
[00:39:37.190] Yeah, or I guess it's like once you have a kid then you might
[00:39:37.190] 是啊，或者我觉得就像有了孩子之后，你可能就会这样。
[00:39:40.690] not be a newlywed anymore.
[00:39:40.690] 不再是新婚夫妇了。
[00:39:42.790] Then I'll be a mom.
[00:39:42.790] 到那时我就会当妈妈了。
[00:39:43.990] Yeah.
[00:39:43.990] 是的。
[00:39:45.990] Well, thank you so much for sharing your honeymoon experience
[00:39:45.990] 非常感谢您分享您的蜜月经历。
[00:39:49.890] with us with me and the listeners.
[00:39:49.890] 和我们，和我，还有听众们。
[00:39:53.790] I'm glad you had fun and I'm also glad you're back.
[00:39:53.790] 我很高兴你玩得开心，也很高兴你回来了。
[00:39:58.190] Thank you.
[00:39:58.190] 谢谢。
[00:39:58.690] It's definitely good to be back.
[00:39:58.690] 能回来真是太好了。
[00:40:00.390] And now I truly feel like our marriage tasks are kind of all
[00:40:00.390] 现在我真的觉得我们婚姻中的任务几乎都完成了。
[00:40:03.690] checked off.
[00:40:03.690] 已勾选。
[00:40:05.490] So I'm curious if there's any listeners out there who have
[00:40:05.490] 所以我很好奇，有没有听众有……
[00:40:09.190] been on their honeymoon.
