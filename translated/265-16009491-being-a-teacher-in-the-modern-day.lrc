[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Hannah.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Hannah。
[00:00:16.880] Welcome Hannah to the podcast. Hannah is an old friend of mine from high school and now Hannah
[00:00:16.880] 欢迎汉娜来到播客节目。汉娜是我高中时的老朋友，现在她……
[00:00:24.880] herself is a teacher. So we thought it would be really, really interesting to bring Hannah on and
[00:00:24.880] 她本人就是一名教师。所以我们觉得让汉娜加入我们一定会非常有趣。
[00:00:31.320] talk about her new and expanded perspective of school. I feel like it's such an interesting time
[00:00:31.320] 谈谈她对学校的全新且更广阔的看法。我觉得这是一个非常有趣的时期。
[00:00:39.820] too because over the course of this year, I've kind of talked about how I sometimes don't feel like an
[00:00:39.820] 也因为在今年这一年里，我曾多次谈到我有时感觉自己不像个……
[00:00:46.080] adult. I don't know what I'm doing or where I am. And I feel like looking back and reflecting,
[00:00:46.080] 成年人了。我不知道自己在做什么，也不知道自己身在何处。我想回顾过去，反思一下。
[00:00:52.640] comparing yourself back to when we were in high school or even college, it really does show how
[00:00:52.640] 和高中甚至大学时期相比，现在的自己真的能看出……
[00:00:58.580] much you've grown. And I feel like Hannah, you see these like high school kids every day. And so it's
[00:00:58.580] 你成长了很多。我觉得汉娜，你每天都能看到这些高中生。所以……
[00:01:04.980] really an eye opener for you, I'm sure to like see how different or maybe even similar you all can be.
[00:01:04.980] 这肯定让你大开眼界，我肯定会很乐意看到你们彼此之间有多么不同，或者也许还有一些相似之处。
[00:01:11.880] So we're really excited to have you on. And I guess to kind of get the ball rolling,
[00:01:11.880] 我们非常高兴你能来。我想先抛砖引玉一下，
[00:01:18.980] how would you describe your experience of being a teacher? Just like overall in general?
[00:01:18.980] 您如何描述自己作为一名教师的经历？就整体而言？
[00:01:24.740] Well, I'm now in my sixth year of teaching high school English. And I would kind of describe the
[00:01:24.740] 嗯，我教高中英语已经六年了。我会这样描述……
[00:01:31.960] experience, I guess like in three words, I would consider it very fulfilling, humbling, and also
[00:01:31.960] 这段经历，我想用三个词来形容，我会说它非常充实、令人谦卑，而且
[00:01:37.620] challenging. And it does feel kind of insane to like say in my own words, I've been a teacher for
[00:01:37.620] 很有挑战性。而且，用我自己的话来说，感觉有点不可思议，我已经当了这么久的老师……
[00:01:44.760] six years now, especially because my first year was 2019 to 2020. And so that was such a chaotic year
[00:01:44.760] 六年了，尤其是我第一年是在2019到2020年。那真是混乱的一年。
[00:01:52.700] because we entered a global pandemic and we had online learning and then we had hybrid learning.
[00:01:52.700] 因为我们进入了全球疫情大流行时期，我们经历了线上学习，然后又经历了混合式学习。
[00:01:59.080] And then we had fully back in person learning. I low-key don't remember maybe the first three years.
[00:01:59.080] 然后我们就全面恢复了线下授课。说实话，我可能不太记得前三年是怎么过的了。
[00:02:06.680] Like I remember moments and like snippets, but a lot of it's kind of a blur. And sometimes I don't
[00:02:06.680] 我记得一些片段和瞬间，但很多事情都模糊不清。有时我甚至记不清。
[00:02:12.900] even remember like my students' faces from those years because we had to wear masks too. And so that
[00:02:12.900] 甚至还记得那些年学生们的脸，因为我们也必须戴口罩。所以……
[00:02:17.900] just feels like a completely different part of my life. It's a huge 180 from like the kind of teaching
[00:02:17.900] 感觉就像是我人生中完全不同的阶段。这和我以前的教学方式完全相反，简直是180度大转弯。
[00:02:24.440] experience that I have now. And yeah. So then when the pandemic ended and we were back in real life
[00:02:24.440] 我现在的经历。是的。然后，当疫情结束，我们回归正常生活时……
[00:02:31.280] learning, I guess, did you feel like you had to relearn how to be a teacher in some senses?
[00:02:31.280] 我想，在学习的过程中，你是否觉得在某种程度上你需要重新学习如何成为一名教师？
[00:02:37.080] I don't know if I felt like I had to relearn being a teacher, but there are just so many more
[00:02:37.080] 我不知道自己是否感觉需要重新学习如何当老师，但确实还有很多其他的事情需要处理。
[00:02:41.660] variables and factors coming into play. I mostly taught underclassmen my first couple years. So I
[00:02:41.660] 各种变量和因素都会影响结果。我头几年主要教的是低年级学生。所以……
[00:02:47.980] always taught freshmen and now I teach juniors and seniors, but I just remember the first like year
[00:02:47.980] 我以前教大一新生，现在教大三和大四学生，但我只记得第一年的情况。
[00:02:55.840] in person. We had no online learning, no hybrid model. I just remember my freshmen being so socially
[00:02:55.840] 都是线下授课。我们没有线上学习，也没有混合模式。我只记得我的大一新生们都非常善于社交。
[00:03:03.600] immature and also just like very deprived. They were like online and at home in like middle school,
[00:03:03.600] 他们不成熟，而且感觉很缺教育。他们好像还在上中学，就整天泡在家里上网。
[00:03:11.880] et cetera. And so they didn't really have like that middle school experience. And so they very much had
[00:03:11.880] 等等。所以他们并没有真正体验过中学生活。所以他们非常……
[00:03:17.020] middle school energy, which is not what I signed up for. So it was just like super chaotic. Students,
[00:03:17.020] 中学生活的活力，这可不是我当初选择中学时所期待的。所以当时简直超级混乱。学生们，
[00:03:24.260] they would get really close and then they would get into fights really easily. They would like break
[00:03:24.260] 他们会变得非常亲密，然后很容易就打起来。他们就像……
[00:03:28.860] friendships like left and right because it's just so much all at once. It was just hard for them to
[00:03:28.860] 友谊就像左右摇摆，因为一下子要面对太多事情。对他们来说，这太难了。
[00:03:35.300] like kind of come back into learning. And also high school is just so different from middle school,
[00:03:35.300] 感觉像是重新开始学习。而且高中和初中真的太不一样了。
[00:03:41.280] which they kind of missed out on. But I just remember it just felt very chaotic. And like as a
[00:03:41.280] 他们算是错过了。但我只记得当时感觉非常混乱。就像……
[00:03:46.840] teacher, you have to make all of these decisions so quickly at a split second, like you're trying to do
[00:03:46.840] 老师，你必须在瞬间做出所有这些决定，就像你现在试图做的那样。
[00:03:52.640] a lesson and then some kid in the corner is not paying attention or like another kid is saying
[00:03:52.640] 上课的时候，角落里有个孩子没在听，或者像另一个孩子说的那样……
[00:03:58.080] something like out of pocket shit. And you're like, okay, well now like, I'm like, we don't do that.
[00:03:58.080] 就像是自掏腰包的破事儿。然后你就说，好吧，现在就像，我说，我们不做那种事。
[00:04:03.220] That's not the culture. That's not the norm. Or like if they don't act right, I'm like, go outside.
[00:04:03.220] 那不是我们的文化，那不是我们的常态。或者说，如果他们行为不端，我就会说，出去走走。
[00:04:08.760] And it's just like all these things. Sometimes I'll get a phone call and be like,
[00:04:08.760] 就像所有这些事情一样。有时候我会接到一个电话，然后说，
[00:04:11.780] oh, so-and-so's parents here to pick them up. I'm like, okay, you can go. Anyways.
[00:04:11.780] 哦，某某的父母来接孩子了。我就说，好吧，你们可以走了。总之。
[00:04:20.320] So it's just like so much all at once. First two years, I think being fully back in person after
[00:04:20.320] 所以感觉一下子要经历很多事。头两年，我觉得最主要的是完全恢复线下授课。
[00:04:26.940] a pandemic were probably the roughest years. And I think nationwide, our principal was sharing how
[00:04:26.940] 疫情期间可能是最艰难的几年。我认为在全国范围内，我们的校长都在分享如何应对疫情。
[00:04:33.020] you were seeing a lot of it across the nation, like more fights, just more like behavioral issues,
[00:04:33.020] 全国各地都经常发生这种情况，比如打架斗殴增多，行为问题也越来越多。
[00:04:38.020] etc. Low scores all around. Dude, isn't it hard to establish authority as a teacher when you yourself
[00:04:38.020] 等等。分数都很低。哥们，你自己当老师，要树立权威难道不难吗？
[00:04:47.160] are so young? Because I'm thinking, especially 2019, 2020, you were probably like just out of undergrad.
[00:04:47.160] 你们这么年轻吗？因为我想，特别是2019年、2020年，你们可能刚从本科毕业。
[00:04:54.740] And being so close in age to your students, I'm sure could pose a little bit of difficulty or maybe
[00:04:54.740] 而且你和学生年龄相近，我确信这可能会带来一些困难，或者……
[00:05:00.860] like nuance that you have to navigate. You know, I thought that was my fear when I first started
[00:05:00.860] 就像需要你去把握的细微差别。你知道吗，我一开始的时候，以为那就是我最害怕的事情。
[00:05:05.040] teaching. But because I started teaching when I was like 23, essentially 22, 23. I remember having
[00:05:05.040] 教书。但我开始教书的时候才23岁，确切地说是22、23岁。我记得当时
[00:05:12.520] that fear of like, oh, well, the students don't respect me, etc. Will it be hard to establish
[00:05:12.520] 那种害怕，比如，哦，学生们不尊重我，等等。建立这种关系会很难吗？
[00:05:16.560] authority? But at the end of the day, you could be the smartest kid. I'm still smarter than you.
[00:05:16.560] 权威？但说到底，就算你是最聪明的孩子，我还是比你聪明。
[00:05:23.040] Like, I'm still the adult in the room that is responsible for you. And like, even though I'm
[00:05:23.040] 就好像，我仍然是房间里那个对你负有责任的成年人。而且，即使我
[00:05:29.320] young, you feel that gap with the students, even with like seniors, granted, I am a bit like older
[00:05:29.320] 年轻人，你会感觉到和学生之间的差距，即使是和学长学姐之间也是如此，当然，我有点像个老学姐。
[00:05:36.220] now in my late 20s. And I teach juniors and seniors. But when you're in the classroom, and you interact
[00:05:36.220] 我现在快三十岁了，教的是高二和高三的学生。但是当你身处课堂，与学生互动时，你会发现……
[00:05:43.200] with the students, I think it's very, I don't want to say easy. But I feel like if you are very secure in
[00:05:43.200] 和学生们相处，我觉得非常……我不想说容易。但我觉得如果你对自己很有信心……
[00:05:50.000] yourself as a teacher, and you don't seek your students validation, it's actually much easier.
[00:05:50.000] 如果你自己作为一名教师，不寻求学生的认可，实际上会容易得多。
[00:05:56.920] It comes naturally, I think, to establish authority and to kind of command respect, because the students
[00:05:56.920] 我认为，建立权威和赢得尊重是学生的自然反应，因为他们……
[00:06:03.860] will know. They can gauge and they'll kind of try to push their boundaries a little bit to see how much
[00:06:03.860] 他们会知道的。他们能判断，而且他们会尝试稍微试探一下自己的底线，看看能做到什么程度。
[00:06:10.440] you're willing to take how much you're willing to let by. But I think as a teacher, if you're holding
[00:06:10.440] 你愿意接受多少，就看你愿意放手多少。但我认为，作为一名教师，如果你坚持己见，
[00:06:15.400] yourself to a high standard, and you hold your students to a high standard, they will recognize
[00:06:15.400] 如果你对自己要求很高，并且对学生也要求很高，他们会认可你的高标准。
[00:06:21.120] your authority and respect you. Yeah. And I think for me, I also respect my students,
[00:06:21.120] 你的权威和尊重，是的。而且我觉得，我也很尊重我的学生。
[00:06:26.500] like I always greet my students, or I try to. Sometimes there's something that needs to be done in
[00:06:26.500] 就像我平时跟学生打招呼那样，或者说我尽量这样做。有时候，有些事情需要处理。
[00:06:31.740] between passing periods. But I will always try to greet my students at the door. And I take them
[00:06:31.740] 课间休息的时候。但我总是会尽量在门口迎接我的学生。我会带他们去教室。
[00:06:36.380] seriously. And I hold them to high standards. And I think they recognize that. And not every student is
[00:06:36.380] 说真的。我对他们的要求很高。我想他们也意识到了这一点。而且并不是每个学生都是如此。
[00:06:42.020] going to like you. And that's totally fine, because I don't need my students to like me. I do know that my
[00:06:42.020] 我会喜欢你的。这完全没问题，因为我不需要我的学生喜欢我。我知道我的
[00:06:47.340] students like me. But I don't need them to, to understand that I'm still good at what I do. And I have their
[00:06:47.340] 学生们喜欢我。但我不需要他们喜欢我，也不需要他们理解我仍然擅长我所做的事。而且我也有他们的
[00:06:55.180] best interests at heart. And so I think at the end of the day, that's reciprocated.
[00:06:55.180] 一切都以对方的利益为重。所以我觉得最终，这种付出也会得到回报。
[00:06:59.820] I think that makes sense to what you said earlier, no matter how smart the smartest kid is,
[00:06:59.820] 我觉得这跟你之前说的有道理，不管最聪明的孩子有多聪明，
[00:07:04.840] you are still going to be smarter, like more mature, have just lived more life experiences. And I feel
[00:07:04.840] 你仍然会变得更聪明，更成熟，拥有更多的人生阅历。我觉得
[00:07:13.180] like once you said that out loud, it totally makes a lot of sense. Teenagers just think they're the best
[00:07:13.180] 你这么一说，确实很有道理。青少年就是觉得自己最厉害。
[00:07:18.560] all the time. But like, they're not. And I don't say that to like undermine any of them in any way,
[00:07:18.560] 一直都是这样。但实际上并非如此。我这么说绝不是要贬低他们中的任何人。
[00:07:25.520] their intellect or their capacity to be really smart. It's just that like, I am the adult in the room.
[00:07:25.520] 他们的智力或者说他们变得非常聪明的能力。只是，我是房间里唯一的成年人。
[00:07:32.100] And I had different expectations and rules and responsibilities than you do as a student.
[00:07:32.100] 我作为学生所受到的期望、规则和责任，与你不同。
[00:07:37.720] Right. And so we're not the same.
[00:07:37.720] 没错。所以我们并不一样。
[00:07:39.680] Yeah.
[00:07:39.680] 是的。
[00:07:41.880] It's also crazy to think that certain things that you do as a teacher were things that my teachers
[00:07:41.880] 想到你作为老师所做的某些事情，而这些事情我的老师们也做过，真是令人难以置信。
[00:07:47.700] also did, which is like stand at the door and like say hi to people. Or I think we also had some
[00:07:47.700] 我们也做了，就是站在门口跟人打招呼。或者我想我们还有一些其他的。
[00:07:52.780] students who would insist on certain things like calling people by their last name, you know,
[00:07:52.780] 有些学生会坚持某些习惯，比如称呼别人的姓氏，你知道的。
[00:07:57.640] like Miss Kim or whatever. And it's crazy to think that these are all like stylistic choices
[00:07:57.640] 就像金小姐之类的。想想这些都只是风格选择，真是不可思议。
[00:08:02.320] that are made by the teacher instead of just the way things are. Because I don't think I really
[00:08:02.320] 而是老师制定的规则，而不是事物本来的样子。因为我不认为我真的
[00:08:07.520] recognize that as a student. I was just like, Oh, this teacher's is that but looking back,
[00:08:07.520] 作为学生时我意识到了这一点。我当时就想，哦，这位老师就是这样，但现在回想起来，
[00:08:11.920] all of it was individual choices that the teachers made.
[00:08:11.920] 这一切都是老师们各自做出的选择。
[00:08:15.640] Very much so. And they're like every teacher has their own style. And it does kind of range
[00:08:15.640] 确实如此。而且每位老师都有自己的教学风格。确实存在一些差异。
[00:08:21.320] depending on like your experience, how long you've been at the school site, etc.
[00:08:21.320] 这取决于你的经验、你在学校工作的时间长短等等。
[00:08:26.400] Are there individual choices that you make for your appearance as well? So something I saw on TikTok
[00:08:26.400] 你也会在外表上做一些个性化的选择吗？我在TikTok上看到了一些东西。
[00:08:33.100] recently was like, I'm a teacher who is fairly young. So like kind of close in age with
[00:08:33.100] 最近我感觉自己像个老师，而且年纪还比较轻。所以，年龄跟我差不多。
[00:08:37.520] my students. So therefore I try to dress more mature or in like a specific way to command
[00:08:37.520] 我的学生。因此，我尽量穿得更成熟一些，或者说，以一种特定的方式来展现我的权威。
[00:08:43.320] like a certain vibe.
[00:08:43.320] 就像某种氛围。
[00:08:45.480] That's so funny, because I, I just wear what I want. That is still like work appropriate.
[00:08:45.480] 太搞笑了，因为我，我都是想穿什么就穿什么。而且这样穿也完全符合工作场合的着装要求。
[00:08:53.200] I am tenured at my school site. And so it's nice to have that job security. It does kind
[00:08:53.200] 我在学校有终身教职，所以有这份工作保障感觉很好。确实如此。
[00:08:59.500] of make a difference in how you feel comfortable with just yourself and like in that space or at
[00:08:59.500] 改变你对自己的舒适感，以及你在那种空间或环境中的感觉。
[00:09:06.300] that school site. I just wear what I want. That makes me feel good. And that is still professional,
[00:09:06.300] 那个学校网站。我只穿我想穿的衣服。这让我感觉很好。而且这仍然很专业。
[00:09:12.460] but still my own style. So my students love my fits.
[00:09:12.460] 但仍然是我自己的风格。所以我的学生们都很喜欢我的搭配。
[00:09:18.760] That's so cute.
[00:09:18.760] 太可爱了。
[00:09:20.180] They like tell me pretty frequently, they're like, I love your fit today, Miss Lee.
[00:09:20.180] 他们经常跟我说：“李小姐，我今天很喜欢你的穿着。”
[00:09:24.520] Oh my god.
[00:09:24.520] 我的天啊。
[00:09:25.600] That's so cute.
[00:09:25.600] 太可爱了。
[00:09:26.420] Thank you.
[00:09:26.420] 谢谢。
[00:09:27.900] No, yeah. So I think I actually do just pretty casually sometimes. So there's some days where
[00:09:27.900] 不，是的。所以我觉得我有时候确实会很随意地这样做。所以有些日子里，
[00:09:34.200] I dress pretty professional with like a dress pants, etc. I'm drinking like Aritzia has really
[00:09:34.200] 我穿衣打扮比较正式，比如穿西裤之类的。我喝的酒，Aritzia 真的很多。
[00:09:39.000] good professional basics. I will wear jeans, I will wear cargo pants, I will wear what I feel
[00:09:39.000] 良好的职业基本款。我会穿牛仔裤，我会穿工装裤，我会穿我想穿的衣服。
[00:09:45.200] comfortable in. I'm like five too. So I wear heels a lot pretty much almost every day. But once it gets
[00:09:45.200] 穿着舒服。我身高也差不多五英尺。所以我几乎每天都穿高跟鞋。但一旦它……
[00:09:51.160] cold, I'm wearing my sneakers, I'm wearing my Adidas tambas or whatever. On the days that I dress pretty
[00:09:51.160] 冷的时候，我就穿运动鞋，比如阿迪达斯Tamba之类的。如果哪天我穿得漂亮点，我就穿运动鞋。
[00:09:59.180] casually, you know, my admin, my colleagues have seen the way I dress too. It's never really been an
[00:09:59.180] 说实话，我的行政人员和同事们也都见过我的穿着打扮。这从来都不是什么……
[00:10:05.300] issue because I think it's like my way of expressing myself. But also, I still command respect and I have
[00:10:05.300] 我觉得这是我表达自我的一种方式，所以这对我来说是个问题。但同时，我仍然能赢得尊重，而且我拥有……
[00:10:12.480] authority in my classroom. I think if anything kind of helps for the students to see that like,
[00:10:12.480] 我在课堂上拥有权威。我认为这对学生来说是一种帮助，让他们看到这一点，比如，
[00:10:17.200] oh, I have my own style. And I can work my own style. Instead of trying to like fit in or try to
[00:10:17.200] 哦，我有自己的风格。我可以坚持自己的风格。而不是试图融入或试图……
[00:10:24.800] seem too business professional, etc. Because like, I'm in my classroom all day. And so part of me
[00:10:24.800] 显得太商务、太正式等等。因为我整天都在教室里。所以，我的一部分
[00:10:32.620] preparing for the school day is also feeling good about myself. And so what I wear kind of helps.
[00:10:32.620] 准备上学这件事本身也会让我感觉良好。所以，穿什么衣服也会有所帮助。
[00:10:38.060] That makes a lot of sense. And you're probably like getting up and walking around a lot too. So you
[00:10:38.060] 这很有道理。而且你可能也经常起身走动。所以你
[00:10:42.340] want to be comfortable. I feel like if I had a teacher who dressed pretty casual or like had cool
[00:10:42.340] 我想要穿着舒适。我觉得如果我的老师穿着比较休闲或者很酷的话，我会很开心。
[00:10:49.700] fits, I would respect them more because I'd be like, damn, this teacher is hella cool.
[00:10:49.700] 如果合适，我会更尊重他们，因为我会想，哇，这个老师太酷了。
[00:10:54.680] I do think I'd give that vibe.
[00:10:54.680] 我觉得我的确会给人那种感觉。
[00:10:56.460] Yeah, I could totally see it. And I feel like kind of what we were talking about earlier,
[00:10:56.460] 是的，我完全能理解。我觉得这有点像我们之前讨论的那件事。
[00:11:02.180] the question of like commanding authority, even though you're a little closer to age to these
[00:11:02.180] 即使你离这些年龄更近一些，但关于指挥权威的问题仍然存在。
[00:11:07.060] youngsters. I feel like when I was in high school, if I had a young teacher, I thought they were
[00:11:07.060] 年轻人。我觉得我上高中的时候，如果遇到年轻的老师，我就会觉得他们很年轻。
[00:11:12.100] automatically cooler.
[00:11:12.100] 自动冷却器。
[00:11:14.060] Yeah, that's a privilege you have as like a young teacher. And I think it's going to capitalize on it.
[00:11:14.060] 是的，这是年轻教师所拥有的一种特权。我认为它会充分利用这种特权。
[00:11:19.620] Yeah. I wonder if you ever set trends in your classroom, though.
[00:11:19.620] 是啊。不过，我很好奇你有没有在课堂上引领过什么潮流。
[00:11:25.860] Like trends?
[00:11:25.860] 喜欢潮流吗？
[00:11:27.040] Yeah, you're like students are like, Oh my god, Miss Lee's shoes are so sick. Maybe I should get a pair.
[00:11:27.040] 是啊，就像学生们会说：“天哪，李老师的鞋子太酷了！我也应该买一双。”
[00:11:34.160] When my friend went to Japan last year, I asked her to get me the Onitsuka Tigers, the yellow ones.
[00:11:34.160] 去年我朋友去日本的时候，我让她帮我带回鬼冢虎队的黄色球衣。
[00:11:39.360] So whenever I wear those, my students are like, Oh, nice shoes. And like even my colleagues,
[00:11:39.360] 所以每当我穿那双鞋的时候，我的学生们都会说：“哦，鞋子真好看。”就连我的同事们也是如此。
[00:11:44.140] like my older colleagues, they're like, Oh, nice shoes.
[00:11:44.140] 就像我的一些老同事一样，他们会说：“哦，鞋子真好看。”
[00:11:48.660] I don't know about trends, but I do have colleagues that I'm really close with. And I'm
[00:11:48.660] 我不太了解潮流趋势，但我确实有一些关系非常亲密的同事。而且我
[00:11:55.660] really close with my colleague who was my mentor teacher when I was a student teacher at my site.
[00:11:55.660] 我和我的同事关系非常亲密，他是我当实习老师时的指导老师。
[00:12:00.800] We've also recently hired a lot of newer, younger teachers. There are two other female teachers that
[00:12:00.800] 我们最近也聘请了很多年轻的新教师。还有两位女教师……
[00:12:06.560] I'm really close with. We went to the football game last night for a senior night. We saw some
[00:12:06.560] 我和她关系真的很好。昨晚我们一起去看了橄榄球赛，那是高年级学生之夜。我们看到了一些……
[00:12:11.640] of our students are like, Oh, it's the three musceteers. Oh my god.
[00:12:11.640] 我们的一些学生会说：“哦，是三个火枪手！我的天哪！”
[00:12:15.920] And like they know. Yeah. I don't know about like trends, but they know like our patterns.
[00:12:15.920] 他们好像都知道。是啊。我不了解什么趋势，但他们了解我们的行事方式。
[00:12:21.360] Oh my god.
[00:12:21.360] 我的天啊。
[00:12:22.220] At school. Because sometimes I will come in, I have like a prep period. So that's like a period where
[00:12:22.220] 在学校。因为有时候我会来学校，然后会有一段准备时间。那段时间就像是……
[00:12:28.760] you don't teach essentially and like you prep. And so sometimes during my prep period, I'll drop
[00:12:28.760] 你基本上不教课，而是备课。所以有时候在我的备课期间，我会放弃一些内容。
[00:12:34.000] off coffee for some of them. And like the students like, Oh, Miss Lee, brought coffee again.
[00:12:34.000] 有些人没带咖啡来。学生们就像是说：“哦，李老师又带咖啡来了。”
[00:12:41.950] Oh my god. That's so cute.
[00:12:41.950] 我的天哪，太可爱了！
[00:12:44.010] Yeah. So I don't know if we like set trends, but we definitely when you're at school every day,
[00:12:44.010] 是的。所以我不知道我们是否喜欢设定潮流，但当你每天在学校的时候，我们肯定会喜欢。
[00:12:50.080] right? And you're interacting with students and interacting with your colleagues. I think
[00:12:50.080] 对吧？你既要和学生互动，也要和同事互动。我觉得
[00:12:54.610] they definitely recognize patterns. I mean, students just see so much like I'm thinking back
[00:12:54.610] 他们肯定能识别出规律。我的意思是，学生们能看到很多东西，就像我回想起来的那样。
[00:13:00.770] to my high school days. And I don't know if we necessarily dissected people's fashion. But we
[00:13:00.770] 回想起我的高中时代。我不知道我们当时是否真的分析过别人的穿着打扮。但我们
[00:13:07.490] definitely talked about things like this person tends to be like a really happy teacher or like this person
[00:13:07.490] 肯定会谈到类似这样的事情：这个人往往像个非常快乐的老师，或者像这个人一样。
[00:13:14.290] presumably might have things going on at home because he's so angry all the time. Like there's
[00:13:14.290] 他总是这么生气，估计家里出了什么事。就像……
[00:13:19.070] all this student gossip that I feel like gets around just because your students are like staring at
[00:13:19.070] 我觉得这些学生间的八卦之所以会传开，仅仅是因为你们的学生都在盯着看。
[00:13:24.170] teachers for eight hours every single day.
[00:13:24.170] 教师每天工作八小时。
[00:13:27.090] Mm hmm. You know, students are, they're very observant. And they will know. Like there's like
[00:13:27.090] 嗯哼。你知道，学生们观察力很强，他们肯定知道。就像……
[00:13:33.950] one day I was just, I was just tired. And I try not to share it too much. But sometimes it's just hard.
[00:13:33.950] 有一天，我真的，真的太累了。我尽量不跟别人说太多，但有时候真的很难。
[00:13:40.270] And he's like, Miss Lee, you good? I was like, respectfully, no.
[00:13:40.270] 他问我：“李小姐，你还好吗？” 我礼貌地回答：“不好。”
[00:13:45.730] Being in me is especially good today.
[00:13:45.730] 今天待在我体内感觉特别好。
[00:13:49.550] You're like, we're just gonna watch a movie today.
[00:13:49.550] 你会想，我们今天就看部电影吧。
[00:13:53.570] Oh my god, but are you ever at work and you're like hungover?
[00:13:53.570] 我的天哪，你有没有过宿醉后还在上班的经历？
[00:13:58.850] Yeah.
[00:13:58.850] 是的。
[00:14:01.910] I'm not gonna deny that, you know, that that has never occurred before. But it's definitely rare.
[00:14:01.910] 我不会否认，这种情况以前从未发生过。但它确实非常罕见。
[00:14:10.350] Yeah.
[00:14:10.350] 是的。
[00:14:11.870] And I tried not to be hungover at work. I think it's just more on a rare occasion where if we have
[00:14:11.870] 我尽量避免在工作时宿醉。我觉得这种情况比较少见，如果我们……
[00:14:18.470] something on a Sunday night, or like maybe we had a little too much fun at our happy hour.
[00:14:18.470] 可能是周日晚上发生的某件事，或者我们在欢乐时光玩得有点太过了。
[00:14:25.930] I remember maybe like two times I was like, pretty hungover the next day. And it was like a work day.
[00:14:25.930] 我记得大概有两次，第二天宿醉得厉害。而且那天还是工作日。
[00:14:31.410] And I was like, I'm never doing this again. And I just try not to.
[00:14:31.410] 我当时就想，我再也不做这种事了。而且我也尽量避免这样做。
[00:14:36.410] Yeah.
[00:14:36.410] 是的。
[00:14:36.590] Yeah.
[00:14:36.590] 是的。
[00:14:36.910] Because it's just rough.
[00:14:36.910] 因为这里环境比较恶劣。
[00:14:38.610] Yeah, I'm sure. And I guess it's like similar to like our jobs. I mean, me personally, I also
[00:14:38.610] 是的，我确定。我觉得这跟我们的工作很相似。就我个人而言，我也
[00:14:44.490] try not to be hungover at work. But I do think I get the benefit of if I am really hungover,
[00:14:44.490] 尽量不要宿醉上班。但我确实觉得，如果我真的宿醉了，反而会有好处。
[00:14:50.750] and I'm at work, I could just try to move all my meetings. But like teaching is unavoidable.
[00:14:50.750] 我在上班，我可以尽量把所有会议都改期。但是教学之类的课程是无法避免的。
[00:14:55.790] Right?
[00:14:55.790] 正确的？
[00:14:56.630] Yeah. And so life just like presents opportunities for you. You gotta take them. But I don't try to like,
[00:14:56.630] 是的。生活就像是会给你提供机会，你必须抓住它们。但我不会试图……
[00:15:05.450] be like, Oh, it'll be okay. Like, etc. It's just more like sometimes like, something spontaneous
[00:15:05.450] 就像，哦，没事的。诸如此类。有时候更像是，一些自发的举动。
[00:15:10.490] happens. And the next day, I'm like, I'm paying for it. We'll not do that again. And that very like
[00:15:10.490] 事情发生了。第二天，我就想，我得为此付出代价。我们不会再犯同样的错误了。而且这种情况非常像……
[00:15:17.170] rarely happens. I would say I've been hungover at work, maybe less than a handful of times. But I
[00:15:17.170] 这种情况很少发生。我宿醉上班的次数，大概屈指可数吧。
[00:15:22.730] also think it's a little unrealistic to be like, Oh, that's so unprofessional. You should never I'm like,
[00:15:22.730] 我也觉得那样说有点不切实际，比如“哦，这太不专业了。你绝对不应该那样做。” 我觉得
[00:15:27.390] shut the fuck up. Everyone has had a day. Yeah. Yeah, like you could have a day and not even be
[00:15:27.390] 闭嘴。谁都有不顺的时候。是啊，是啊，好像你也能过得那么一天，甚至都没什么大不了的。
[00:15:34.890] hungover. True. Well, I do want to ask you this. So now that you have several years of experience being
[00:15:34.890] 宿醉。没错。嗯，我确实想问你这个问题。既然你已经有好几年宿醉的经验了，
[00:15:43.050] a teacher, is there anything that you look at differently? With having this teacher experience
[00:15:43.050] 作为一名教师，您看待事物的方式是否有所不同？凭借您的教师经验
[00:15:49.450] behind you where you look back at your own memories with school? And you're like, damn,
[00:15:49.450] 你回头看看自己在学校的那些回忆，然后你会想，唉，
[00:15:53.050] like, that's crazy. Now that I have all this expertise. It is eye opening. I think just like
[00:15:53.050] 真是太疯狂了。现在我掌握了这么多专业知识，真是大开眼界。我觉得就像……
[00:16:00.450] as you get older, things start to kind of shift or your perspective shift. And as a teacher and as like
[00:16:00.450] 随着年龄增长，事情会开始发生变化，或者说你的视角会发生变化。作为一名教师，以及像我这样的人，
[00:16:07.570] the responsible adult of your classroom, there are definitely a couple things that make me realize
[00:16:07.570] 作为班上负责任的成年人，有几件事确实让我意识到
[00:16:13.250] like, Oh, I kind of have a bit more insight as like why things are the way they should be. When we were
[00:16:13.250] 比如，哦，我对事情为什么会这样发展有了更深的理解。当我们……
[00:16:20.210] in school, like when I was a high school student, I just remember, you know, sometimes you finish a lesson
[00:16:20.210] 在学校里，比如我上高中的时候，我记得，你知道，有时候你学完一节课
[00:16:25.210] early. And you maybe have like a couple minutes left. And I'd be like, Oh, why can't they just let us
[00:16:25.210] 很早。你可能只剩下几分钟了。然后我就会想，哦，为什么他们就不能让我们走呢？
[00:16:30.430] leave a couple minutes early, especially at the end of the day, or maybe like on a Friday, I'm about to go
[00:16:30.430] 最好提前几分钟离开，尤其是在一天快结束的时候，或者像周五那样，我马上就要走了。
[00:16:36.950] off into the weekend. And from like a teacher perspective, if I were to let my students theoretically
[00:16:36.950] 周末就这么过去了。从老师的角度来看，如果我允许我的学生理论上……
[00:16:44.430] leave a couple minutes early, but then something happens to them, let's say like, and my classroom
[00:16:44.430] 他们提前几分钟离开，但后来发生了一些事，比如说，我的教室里……
[00:16:50.530] in particular is pretty close to a parking lot. So let's say like, I don't know, they get hit by a car
[00:16:50.530] 尤其是它离停车场很近。假设，比如说，我不知道，他们被车撞了。
[00:16:55.370] or something, I would be the one that's held responsible, or I would have liability in that
[00:16:55.370] 或者说，我会因此承担责任，或者说我会负有相应的法律义务。
[00:17:01.110] because I was supposed to keep them in until the bell rang and dismiss them. And I was like,
[00:17:01.110] 因为我本应该让他们待到下课铃响后再放他们走。然后我就想，
[00:17:06.830] I'm not about to legally help or anything that happened, you know, on my contracted time. And so
[00:17:06.830] 我不会提供法律援助，也不会处理任何发生在我合同期内的事情。所以
[00:17:14.710] things like that have definitely shifted. My colleagues and I, we went to the senior night
[00:17:14.710] 诸如此类的事情确实发生了变化。我和同事们一起去了毕业晚会。
[00:17:19.790] football game. And ASB and the students are trying to show my school spirit, they're having a lot of fun
[00:17:19.790] 足球比赛。学生会和同学们都在努力展现学校精神，他们玩得很开心。
[00:17:26.410] and cheering. And then they popped off these like colored powders. And I was like, Oh my god,
[00:17:26.410] 然后他们欢呼起来。接着，他们撒下了一些彩色粉末。我当时就想，我的天哪！
[00:17:31.750] it's so cool. Like me and my colleagues were like, wow, that looks so cool. The ASB teacher was like
[00:17:31.750] 太酷了！我和我的同事们都惊呼：哇，这看起来太酷了！学生会老师也说：
[00:17:37.190] going off on them because they they know that you're not allowed to use those materials or
[00:17:37.190] 因为他们知道你不允许使用这些材料，所以才会对他们大发雷霆。
[00:17:44.870] use this kind of poppers, etc. at sporting events, which I had no idea. Their reasoning is because like,
[00:17:44.870] 他们在体育赛事中使用这种爆竹之类的东西，我之前完全不知道。他们的理由是，比如，
[00:17:51.530] oh, it's not safe. Some students may not consent to having that powder on them. You don't know like
[00:17:51.530] 哦，这不安全。有些学生可能不愿意身上沾染那种粉末。你不知道他们会怎么想。
[00:17:57.490] their health needs, their allergies. And I do think that maybe a couple years ago, some kind of
[00:17:57.490] 他们的健康需求，他们的过敏情况。而且我确实认为，也许几年前，某种……
[00:18:03.230] incident where like a powder got on a student's eye and they had an infection. And then that can lead
[00:18:03.230] 有一次，粉末溅到学生眼睛里，导致感染。然后，这可能会导致……
[00:18:08.170] to like, parents potentially wanting to sue the school. And so it's just like, okay, we cannot have
[00:18:08.170] 比如，家长们可能会想起诉学校。所以，好吧，我们不能这样。
[00:18:13.890] that anymore. Right. And so things like that, I'm like, okay, I, there's a lot of like legal liability.
[00:18:13.890] 那样就不行了。没错。所以诸如此类的事情，我就想，好吧，这涉及到很多法律责任。
[00:18:21.790] And as a student, you're just thinking, Oh, it's like harmless. It's not a big deal.
[00:18:21.790] 作为学生，你只会想，哦，这没什么大不了的。
[00:18:25.650] But as an adult, it's very different. And especially like for the school and the district,
[00:18:25.650] 但作为成年人，情况就大不相同了。尤其对于学校和学区而言，更是如此。
[00:18:31.870] because parents have that power to sue, or really anyone has a part of zoom, right? And so it's
[00:18:31.870] 因为家长有权提起诉讼，或者说，Zoom 的任何人都有权提起诉讼，对吧？所以就是这样。
[00:18:38.350] about preventing those accidents that could potentially come out of like those even just
[00:18:38.350] 关于预防那些可能由此产生的事故，即使只是
[00:18:44.390] like fun, silly events. Oh, my God, this is like a prime example, I think of having a frontal
[00:18:44.390] 比如一些有趣、滑稽的活动。哦，我的天哪，这简直就是个绝佳的例子，我想到的是正面
[00:18:51.230] lobe. So ever since this year, I've kind of been obsessed with my frontal lobe, because I know it's
[00:18:51.230] 额叶。所以从今年开始，我就有点迷恋我的额叶，因为我知道它是
[00:18:57.670] developed now. And I've like talked about it with some friends. It's like, Oh, yeah, we just like we
[00:18:57.670] 现在发展起来了。我和一些朋友也聊过这件事。就好像，哦，是的，我们只是喜欢我们
[00:19:04.190] have more anxiety. Now we like care, we know the consequences of things now versus when we were
[00:19:04.190] 焦虑感更强了。现在我们更注重保养，我们知道事情的后果，这与以前相比，我们以前……
[00:19:09.450] younger, we were only thinking of the like, right now, like what is happening, not the like, you know,
[00:19:09.450] 年轻的时候，我们只想着当下正在发生的事情，而不是过去的事情，你知道的。
[00:19:15.330] further down the line, what are the consequences? What are the accidents that could be happening? Or,
[00:19:15.330] 再往后看，会有什么后果？可能会发生哪些事故？或者，
[00:19:19.910] you know, as you said, like legal liabilities, or people around you getting hurt. And so I'm like,
[00:19:19.910] 你知道，就像你说的，比如法律责任，或者身边的人受到伤害。所以我就想，
[00:19:25.030] Oh, my God, this is definitely a prime example of like you having your frontal lobe and the students
[00:19:25.030] 我的天哪，这绝对是你拥有前额叶和学生的典型例子
[00:19:30.150] not.
[00:19:30.150] 不是。
[00:19:31.830] Yeah. I think it's just like when you're young, and you're at that age, it's easier to
[00:19:31.830] 是啊。我觉得就像年轻的时候，到了那个年纪，更容易……
[00:19:38.650] put yourself first. And just, you know, live in a moment. And that's, you know, kind of the
[00:19:38.650] 把自己的需求放在第一位。然后，你知道，活在当下。这就是，你知道的，某种程度上来说……
[00:19:44.310] romanticism of our youth. Right. But I think like you said, like, once you're like prefrontal
[00:19:44.310] 我们青春期的浪漫情怀。没错。但我觉得就像你说的，一旦你像前额叶一样……
[00:19:49.610] cortex, or like your frontal lobe is like fully developed, you're just like, damn, I'm I get
[00:19:49.610] 大脑皮层，或者说你的额叶，就像完全发育成熟了一样，你会觉得，哇，我懂了
[00:19:55.170] it now. Like, I understand. I think that's why your mid 20s. This is my hot take. Your
[00:19:55.170] 现在明白了。我懂了。我觉得这就是为什么你二十五六岁的原因。这是我的看法。你的
[00:20:01.430] mid 20s are like, not as fun of a time. As like, I don't know, entertainment and media
[00:20:01.430] 二十五六岁的时候，感觉没那么有趣了。比如，我不知道，娱乐和媒体方面。
[00:20:08.110] has portrayed it to be. Because that's when your brain is like developing. I felt like I
[00:20:08.110] 就像人们描述的那样。因为那时你的大脑就像在发育。我觉得我
[00:20:12.110] was going to a crisis.
[00:20:12.110] 当时正走向危机。
[00:20:13.090] Dude, for sure. For sure. And like, when we're 25, I feel like that was when we're like in
[00:20:13.090] 兄弟，当然了。绝对的。而且，我觉得当我们25岁的时候，我们就像是……
[00:20:18.390] the pandemic, especially. Yeah. And so I was like, Oh, my God, pandemic, your brain is
[00:20:18.390] 尤其是疫情期间。是的。所以我就想，我的天哪，疫情，你的大脑……
[00:20:23.490] really developing.
[00:20:23.490] 发展势头良好。
[00:20:26.090] We got stunted.
[00:20:26.090] 我们发育迟缓了。
[00:20:29.070] It was just so much all at once.
[00:20:29.070] 事情一下子发生太多了。
[00:20:30.990] Yeah. I do want to ask, though, because you said the students are pretty aware, and they
[00:20:30.990] 是的。不过，我确实想问一下，因为你说学生们对此相当了解，而且他们
[00:20:37.690] notice like your patterns, and they've kind of noticed that you're close to, you know,
[00:20:37.690] 他们注意到你的行为模式，而且他们似乎已经注意到你和……很接近，你知道的。
[00:20:42.830] those other two teachers. So do you notice a lot of the student drama that's going on?
[00:20:42.830] 另外两位老师。你有没有注意到学生们之间发生的很多矛盾冲突？
[00:20:49.030] Who's in a fight? Who's like beefing? And who's like suddenly not friends anymore? Because
[00:20:49.030] 谁在打架？谁跟谁闹矛盾了？谁又突然不再是朋友了？因为
[00:20:55.470] there was a drama or like, maybe people are dating and there's like dating drama to like
[00:20:55.470] 好像发生了一些事，或者，也许有人在谈恋爱，然后就出现了恋爱中的一些狗血剧情。
[00:20:59.950] all of that kind of stuff.
[00:20:59.950] 诸如此类的事情。
[00:21:01.250] Oh, my God, it is just so high school. I, as I said before, students are very observant,
[00:21:01.250] 我的天哪，这简直太像高中生了。正如我之前所说，学生们观察力很强。
[00:21:10.430] but so are teachers. And it's like always super funny. But you could just tell when a student's
[00:21:10.430] 但老师们也是如此。而且总是超级搞笑。但你一眼就能看出学生什么时候……
[00:21:15.150] like on their phone or has their Chromebook open, and you know, they're not doing their
[00:21:15.150] 比如他们拿着手机或者打开 Chromebook，你知道，他们并没有在做他们的
[00:21:19.630] work. And how do you know? I'm like, it's pretty obvious. But also, we're like observing
[00:21:19.630] 工作。你怎么知道？我觉得这很明显。但同时，我们也在观察……
[00:21:25.190] you guys, there is always something happening with our students. People have crushes, they
[00:21:25.190] 各位，我们学生身上总是发生各种各样的事情。有人会暗恋别人，他们
[00:21:33.370] have beef. I had a group of students who were so close at the beginning of the year. And
[00:21:33.370] 有矛盾。年初的时候，我有一群学生关系非常亲密。
[00:21:39.470] then like a month into school, they got to major beef with each other. And I was like,
[00:21:39.470] 开学大概一个月后，他们俩就闹翻了。我当时就想，
[00:21:44.230] what in the world? I was like, what was what's the switch up? They will tell me they will
[00:21:44.230] 这到底是怎么回事？我当时就想，怎么回事？他们肯定会告诉我他们会……
[00:21:49.850] share with me. And I'm just like, Oh, that's so yeah, I remember like going through things
[00:21:49.850] 跟我分享一下。然后我就想，哦，对啊，我记得经历过这些事。
[00:21:54.850] like that in high school. But you see all the time, like I've seen really close friends
[00:21:54.850] 就像高中时那样。但你经常会看到，比如我见过一些非常亲密的朋友。
[00:22:00.430] just like all of a sudden stop talking. Or like they request like a seating change. That's
[00:22:00.430] 就像突然停止说话一样。或者像他们要求换座位一样。就是这样。
[00:22:05.970] when it's like really bad.
[00:22:05.970] 情况真的非常糟糕的时候。
[00:22:07.370] That's juicy.
[00:22:07.370] 真够劲爆的。
[00:22:08.470] And I was like, Oh, okay. And then they're like, it's because like, sometimes I don't even
[00:22:08.470] 我当时就想，哦，好吧。然后他们说，那是因为，有时候我甚至都不……
[00:22:13.350] have to ask. They'll just like tell me. That's so funny. But yeah, it's it. There's
[00:22:13.350] 我得问。他们肯定会直接告诉我。真搞笑。不过，就是这样。
[00:22:18.830] so much drama. Sometimes there's just so much tea. And I tell my students at the beginning
[00:22:18.830] 真是太戏剧化了。有时候，事情真的太多了。我一开始就告诉我的学生们……
[00:22:22.870] of the year because I do like a little intro of myself. I remember on my slideshow, I was
[00:22:22.870] 之所以说这是年度最佳，是因为我喜欢做个自我介绍。我记得在我的幻灯片里，我……
[00:22:27.770] like, these are a couple things that I love. And if you love them too, great. We'll vibe
[00:22:27.770] 比如，这些都是我喜欢的东西。如果你也喜欢，那就太好了。我们一起享受吧！
[00:22:31.630] if not, it's okay. I remember I put like tea because I don't drink coffee. I drink like
[00:22:31.630] 如果不是，也没关系。我记得我写的是茶，因为我不喝咖啡。我喝茶就像
[00:22:37.450] matcha and like I'll drink like yerba mates. My students know I love a yerba mate. And I
[00:22:37.450] 我喜欢抹茶，也喜欢喝马黛茶。我的学生都知道我爱喝马黛茶。而且我
[00:22:43.870] like said, I love literal tea and metaphoric tea. You have any tea to tell me, please let me
[00:22:43.870] 正如我所说，我喜欢字面意义上的茶，也喜欢比喻意义上的茶。如果你有什么茶要告诉我，请告诉我。
[00:22:50.810] know. And it's your secret safe with me. So somebody tell me this stuff. And it's just
[00:22:50.810] 我知道。你的秘密我绝对保密。所以谁来告诉我这些事。就这么简单。
[00:22:55.570] so like, I'm like, Oh my God. Sometimes I'm like, I shouldn't have said that. Because sometimes
[00:22:55.570] 所以，我就会想，我的天哪。有时候我会想，我不该说那些话。因为有时候
[00:23:02.670] like, it can be not stressful, but it's like, Oh, but my heart hurts for them. You know,
[00:23:02.670] 比如，虽然可能并不觉得压力很大，但就是会觉得，“哎，我真为他们难过。” 你知道吗？
[00:23:07.390] when they're going through it. If they request a seating change. Oh, that's, it's crazy. But
[00:23:07.390] 当他们经历这个过程时，如果他们要求换座位。哦，那真是太疯狂了。
[00:23:13.390] sometimes they turn around, like maybe at the end of the semester, they're like, Oh,
[00:23:13.390] 有时候他们会转变态度，比如到了学期末，他们会说：“哦，
[00:23:18.030] yeah, we're besties again. I'm like, I'm like, great.
[00:23:18.030] 是啊，我们又成为好朋友了。我当时就想，太好了。
[00:23:23.490] What a roller coaster. I know. That sounds so fun, honestly, like being up to date with
[00:23:23.490] 真是跌宕起伏啊。我知道。说实话，听起来真有趣，就像随时了解最新动态一样。
[00:23:29.050] the student goss because there's no gossip, like high school gossip. Like that's when
[00:23:29.050] 学生之间的八卦很少，因为这里没有像高中那样的八卦。就像那时候一样。
[00:23:33.010] gossip peaks. Oh, so much. And I think gossip is powerful. And that's not to say like, I
[00:23:33.010] 八卦泛滥成灾。哦，真是太多了。而且我认为八卦的力量非常强大。这并不是说，我
[00:23:39.810] don't believe in like spreading rumors and like all these things. I'm like trying to put
[00:23:39.810] 我不相信散布谣言之类的东西。我只是想表达一下我的想法。
[00:23:43.910] a person down. But I think gossip. It's a tool that women have used through years. It's
[00:23:43.910] 一个人倒下了。但我认为八卦。这是女性多年来一直使用的一种工具。
[00:23:52.150] a way to protect ourselves and also gain knowledge. And you know what? I'm all for it. Obviously,
[00:23:52.150] 既能保护我们自己，又能获取知识。你知道吗？我完全赞成。显然，
[00:24:01.410] certain parts where I'm like, okay, that's not something you should be sharing with me. Or
[00:24:01.410] 有些部分我会想，好吧，这不应该跟我分享。
[00:24:06.250] it's just like, you're being a bully right now. And I will be honest with my students.
[00:24:06.250] 你现在的行为简直就是在欺负人。我会对我的学生们坦诚相待。
[00:24:11.290] When it gets to that point, I'm pretty honest and I try to redirect them. Like that's not,
[00:24:11.290] 到了那个地步，我会很坦诚地引导他们。比如，那不是……
[00:24:15.990] I think the intention. Right. But other times it's like kind of silly or it's like harmless
[00:24:15.990] 我觉得是出于好意。没错。但有时候又显得有点傻，或者无伤大雅。
[00:24:21.050] or I'm just like, Oh, it's just high school. Yeah. You know, it's kind of like a rite of passage
[00:24:21.050] 或者我就想，哦，不就是高中嘛。是啊。你知道，这就像是一种成人礼。
[00:24:27.590] for you to go through these trials and tribulations. Right. I feel like knowing that you are so in
[00:24:27.590] 让你经历这些磨难，真的。我知道你如此投入，这让我很感动。
[00:24:35.750] tune with the student gossip just makes me think that you're super in tune with like the school
[00:24:35.750] 你对学生八卦的了解程度，让我觉得你对学校的情况非常了解。
[00:24:40.330] overall. Like you're really, you know what's going on and you're even like helping guide these
[00:24:40.330] 总的来说，就像你真的了解情况，甚至还在帮助指导这些事情一样。
[00:24:46.670] kids in the right direction when you can in like not just academics, but also in, you know, conflict,
[00:24:46.670] 尽可能引导孩子走上正确的道路，不仅是在学业上，也包括处理冲突方面。
[00:24:52.910] which I feel like is really valuable. And I think just like with any person, like we all need like
[00:24:52.910] 我觉得这真的很有价值。而且我觉得就像对任何人来说一样，我们都需要……
[00:24:59.690] social emotional support. A lot of times they are looking to just be heard. Other times you can
[00:24:59.690] 社交情感支持。很多时候，他们只是想被倾听。其他时候，你可以……
[00:25:06.410] gauge where like, Oh, I think they want some guidance. And that's where it's really important.
[00:25:06.410] 判断他们是否需要一些指导。而这正是它真正重要的地方。
[00:25:11.910] I think as teachers to not just be in tune with our students, but like you said, with our community.
[00:25:11.910] 我认为作为教师，我们不仅要了解学生，还要像你所说，了解我们的社区。
[00:25:17.590] And so I make it a point because we're all on the same team. We're all in the same community trying
[00:25:17.590] 所以我强调这一点，因为我们都是同一个团队的。我们都在同一个社区里，都在努力奋斗。
[00:25:23.210] to like support our students and support each other too. Cause teaching can be really hard or it
[00:25:23.210] 我们要支持学生，也要互相支持。因为教学真的很难。
[00:25:28.170] can be exhausting, I think. And so it's a point to like understand that you're all on the same side.
[00:25:28.170] 我觉得这会让人筋疲力尽。所以，关键是要明白，你们都是站在同一阵线上的。
[00:25:33.550] And so I do my best to like get to know like my colleagues, know the counseling department,
[00:25:33.550] 所以我尽力去了解我的同事，了解咨询部门的情况。
[00:25:40.130] know our admin. And I do think that takes some time. Some people are just naturally really
[00:25:40.130] 了解我们的管理人员。而且我认为这需要一些时间。有些人天生就非常……
[00:25:44.810] more extroverted. I don't really think that was like a big priority for me. My first,
[00:25:44.810] 更外向一些。我并不认为那是我优先考虑的事情。我的第一个，
[00:25:51.170] like two years of being at the site, cause you don't even know if you're going to be there anymore,
[00:25:51.170] 就像在工地待了两年一样，因为你甚至不知道自己是否还会继续待在那里。
[00:25:54.710] right after a year. Cause when you first start your attempt teacher, so your contract is done
[00:25:54.710] 一年后就结束了。因为你刚开始当老师的时候，合同就到期了。
[00:26:00.030] when the school year is done. I think that's not always like on the forefront of a lot of like new
[00:26:00.030] 学年结束时。我认为这并不总是很多新事物的首要考虑因素。
[00:26:05.070] teachers minds to like get to know the community, but it's super important knowing your custodial
[00:26:05.070] 教师们都乐于了解社区，但了解你的后勤保障人员也至关重要。
[00:26:10.350] staff, knowing like the security team, trying to know someone from like each department because a
[00:26:10.350] 工作人员，比如安保团队，尽量认识每个部门的人，因为
[00:26:16.650] lot of times you meet them in passing. And so it's hard to have not like meaningful, but like more
[00:26:16.650] 很多时候你只是匆匆一瞥。所以很难说彼此之间没有意义，但又不止于此。
[00:26:22.330] in-depth conversations with them. And so when you have an opportunity, it's like really important to
[00:26:22.330] 与他们进行深入对话。所以，当你有机会的时候，这真的非常重要。
[00:26:28.510] take that opportunity to get to know one another. I think once you do, you feel like you're building
[00:26:28.510] 借此机会互相了解。我觉得一旦你做到了，你就会感觉你们正在建立联系。
[00:26:33.670] community at your site and you also know you have each other's backs. Like I'm close with our
[00:26:33.670] 你们网站所在的社区里，大家都知道彼此会互相支持。就像我和我们关系很密切一样。
[00:26:39.350] counselors. I know our custodial staff really well and know our security team. And that also,
[00:26:39.350] 辅导员。我非常了解我们的后勤人员和安保团队。而且，
[00:26:46.930] I think positively impacts your students. Like they will know other students as well. You probably
[00:26:46.930] 我认为这会对你的学生产生积极的影响。比如，他们也能认识其他同学。你可能
[00:26:52.430] share a lot of your same students together. If I have like, Oh, maybe I think maybe some,
[00:26:52.430] 把很多相同的学生放在一起教。如果我说，哦，也许我想也许有些，
[00:26:58.930] this student's going through something, then like I can loop counseling in as well.
[00:26:58.930] 如果这个学生遇到了什么问题，那我就可以安排心理咨询了。
[00:27:03.170] Have some conversations on how we could support them. But I think as you shared, it's super
[00:27:03.170] 我们可以讨论一下如何支持他们。但我觉得正如你所说，这非常棒。
[00:27:08.650] important to be in tune with your students, but also be in tune with the overall community. And I
[00:27:08.650] 了解学生固然重要，但了解整个社区也同样重要。而且我
[00:27:13.150] think the longer you're in teaching, the more you crave that because as much as I love my students,
[00:27:13.150] 我觉得教书的时间越长，就越渴望那种感觉，因为尽管我深爱我的学生，
[00:27:20.190] because I'm interacting with my students all day, I crave adult communication. Like I have to talk to
[00:27:20.190] 因为我整天都和学生互动，所以我渴望和成年人交流。就像我必须和他们说话一样。
[00:27:27.910] my colleague, like my work besties, even just like to say hi, a two minute conversation. Like I need that
[00:27:27.910] 我的同事，就像我的工作好友一样，哪怕只是打个招呼，聊两分钟也好。好像我需要似的。
[00:27:35.630] because I'm just, I'm talking to high schoolers all day.
[00:27:35.630] 因为我整天都在和高中生聊天。
[00:27:39.810] That makes total sense. I'm just imagining you like catching your work friend in the hallways and
[00:27:39.810] 完全说得通。我只是想象你喜欢在走廊里偶遇你的同事朋友，然后……
[00:27:46.250] you're like, Oh my God, did you hear about like so-and-so? Like, did you hear about all the student
[00:27:46.250] 你会想，我的天哪，你听说过某某的事吗？比如，你听说过所有学生的事吗？
[00:27:50.270] drama right now? Oh no. Yeah. We update each other like no other. Like sometimes while I break in,
[00:27:50.270] 现在又有狗血剧情？哦不。是啊。我们俩的近况更新特别及时。比如有时候我闯进来的时候，
[00:27:57.770] as soon as the students leave, I like call up my friend. I'm like, Oh my God.
[00:27:57.770] 学生们一走，我就给朋友打电话。我说：“我的天哪。”
[00:28:02.550] That's so funny. They just told me this. And like, we keep it confidential to ourselves, you know?
[00:28:02.550] 太搞笑了。他们刚才跟我说了这件事。而且，我们一直都把这事保密，你知道吗？
[00:28:08.230] Right. Right. Like we know the students, but it's just so funny sometimes.
[00:28:08.230] 对，对。我们好像都认识这些学生，但有时候真的太搞笑了。
[00:28:11.030] It's like watching your own high school drama TV show. Yeah. Do you find that you ever have to like
[00:28:11.030] 就像在看自己的高中校园剧一样。是啊。你有没有觉得你不得不喜欢上某个人？
[00:28:19.050] draw boundaries with your students? I say that because when I was a student, you know, with some
[00:28:19.050] 要和学生划清界限吗？我这么说是因为我当学生的时候，你知道，有些……
[00:28:24.490] of our younger teachers, the bad kids in the class would try to like follow them on Instagram or like
[00:28:24.490] 对于我们年轻的老师，班里那些坏孩子会想方设法在Instagram上关注他们，或者做其他事情。
[00:28:30.770] add them on Facebook, try to kind of like push that limit with them even during class of sometimes they
[00:28:30.770] 在Facebook上加他们好友，试着和他们玩点刺激的，有时候甚至在课堂上也是如此。
[00:28:37.910] would like try to flirt or do these things. So have you ever had that experience with your students?
[00:28:37.910] 想尝试调情或者做这些事。你和学生有过类似的经历吗？
[00:28:43.410] I've had a couple experiences with students who try to like push those boundaries. And when that
[00:28:43.410] 我遇到过几个学生试图挑战这些界限。而当这种情况发生时，我就会采取一些措施。
[00:28:50.350] happens, I immediately draw the line. I don't entertain it. I like shut it down because it's just not
[00:28:50.350] 如果发生这种情况，我会立即划清界限。我不会理会。我会直接制止，因为这根本不合理。
[00:28:57.050] appropriate. And so sometimes students will be like, Oh, can we like follow your Instagram? I'm like,
[00:28:57.050] 合适。所以有时候学生会说，哦，我们可以关注你的Instagram吗？我会说，
[00:29:02.290] no, not when like you're actively like my student. Right. I know some teachers who like,
[00:29:02.290] 不，除非你像我的学生一样积极参与。没错。我知道有些老师喜欢这样，
[00:29:07.450] have students follow them like on their social media after they graduate. And like, I have a couple
[00:29:07.450] 让学生毕业后在社交媒体上关注他们。而且，我还有一些这样的例子。
[00:29:11.890] that I let follow me. And those are ones that I'm like, I trust you. You know, you're not gonna like,
[00:29:11.890] 我允许他们跟随我。这些人，我会想，我相信你。你知道，你不会喜欢的，
[00:29:18.430] be telling like the current high schoolers anything. And in terms of like students who try to flirt,
[00:29:18.430] 就像现在的高中生那样，什么都敢说。至于那些试图调情的学生，
[00:29:24.230] because I remember going to high school and like whenever there was a young, attractive sub,
[00:29:24.230] 因为我记得上高中的时候，每当有年轻漂亮的男学生出现，
[00:29:29.970] everyone will go crazy. I by no means am comparing myself to that.
[00:29:29.970] 所有人都会疯掉。我绝不是要把自己比作那样的人。
[00:29:37.170] But you know, you always get like, a couple students who try to push that boundary. And I just
[00:29:37.170] 但你知道，总会有一两个学生试图挑战底线。而我当时就……
[00:29:43.870] don't, I will never entertain it. I'm like immediately know. And like, you know, if they're
[00:29:43.870] 别这样，我绝对不会考虑。我一眼就能看出来。而且，你知道，如果他们
[00:29:48.750] just trying to be funny too. But I think it's important not to humor them. Because it's also not
[00:29:48.750] 我也只是想开个玩笑。但我认为重要的是不要一味迎合他们。因为这也不是……
[00:29:56.090] every student truly knows you as a person. Yeah. And so even if you're trying to like meet at their
[00:29:56.090] 每个学生都真正了解你这个人。是的。所以即使你想在他们那里认识他们，也一样。
[00:30:00.650] level, and like just humor them, that is not going to be interpreted the same by everyone.
[00:30:00.650] 保持平和的心态，就像逗他们开心一样，因为每个人的理解都不一样。
[00:30:06.330] And so I've had like, once he was like, Miss Lee, like, do you want to hang out this weekend? I was
[00:30:06.330] 所以有一次，他问我：“李小姐，你这周末想出去玩吗？” 我当时
[00:30:10.670] like, No, get out. Like, it's so right. Go home. And I think when I see that, I'm just like, they're
[00:30:10.670] 就像，不，出去。就像，这太对了。回家吧。我觉得当我看到这种情况时，我就想，他们
[00:30:18.430] just being teenagers, like being bold and like trying to be funny. And all these things. And
[00:30:18.430] 就是青少年该有的样子，比如大胆做事，想逗人开心。诸如此类。
[00:30:25.930] you said your piece, I'm gonna say my
[00:30:25.930] 你已经说完了，我也要说说我的。
[00:30:29.510] they might try once. And when you shut it down, they don't bring it up again. And what they say
[00:30:29.510] 他们或许会尝试一次。一旦你制止了他们，他们就不会再提起这件事了。他们说的话
[00:30:34.570] amongst their friends, that's like, on their own personal time. But it's like what they say to me,
[00:30:34.570] 在朋友之间，那是他们自己的私人时间。但就像他们跟我说的那样，
[00:30:38.990] and like how they interact with me. I'm just like, I very much draw that line. Because in my opinion,
[00:30:38.990] 还有他们跟我互动的方式。我就是觉得，我在这方面很有底线。因为在我看来，
[00:30:44.710] is it's not a humorous thing to entertain. Because it's like you are literally an adult who is
[00:30:44.710] 这不是一件能让人觉得好笑的事。因为这就像你明明是个成年人，却……
[00:30:50.150] responsible for them. And they are children. They are children. You'll see it on the news. Sometimes
[00:30:50.150] 对他们负有责任。他们还是孩子。他们还是孩子。你会在新闻上看到。有时候
[00:31:00.170] you'll see those teachers or coaches. It's like a teacher or coach who had an inappropriate
[00:31:00.170] 你会看到那些老师或教练。就像某个老师或教练有过不恰当的行为一样。
[00:31:05.510] relation with a student. I'm like, that's so insane. Because that's completely predatory.
[00:31:05.510] 和学生发生关系。我觉得这太疯狂了。因为这完全就是性侵。
[00:31:12.310] I'm just like, you're a grown adult preying on a young child. Yeah. People try to like work around
[00:31:12.310] 我当时就想，你一个成年人居然对一个小孩下手。是啊。人们总是想方设法钻空子。
[00:31:18.190] especially if they're like 18. And I'm like, No, it's not because the context of what you're meeting
[00:31:18.190] 尤其是如果他们只有18岁左右。我就想，不，这并不是因为你遇到的情况。
[00:31:23.630] them in is at a school site where you are responsible for them. And so when I see that,
[00:31:23.630] 它们被放在学校里，而你对他们负有责任。所以当我看到这种情况时，
[00:31:29.710] it's crazy. It is. And you're right, like they're children, like you're in completely different life
[00:31:29.710] 太疯狂了。真的。你说得对，他们就像孩子一样，感觉就像身处完全不同的世界。
[00:31:36.070] stages. They're much more immature, not as an insult, just like as a fact, they're much more
[00:31:36.070] 阶段。他们要不成熟得多，这不是侮辱，只是事实，他们要不成熟得多。
[00:31:41.970] immature than you. And they're a completely different species almost. And I do think that
[00:31:41.970] 他们比你还不成熟。他们几乎是完全不同的物种。而且我确实认为……
[00:31:48.890] in a way, like what I mentioned before about how it's important as a teacher to be secure in yourself,
[00:31:48.890] 从某种意义上说，就像我之前提到的，作为一名教师，自信非常重要。
[00:31:54.190] in your capacity to do well, to be an excellent teacher, to make a difference in all these things,
[00:31:54.190] 以你的能力，你完全可以做得很好，成为一名优秀的老师，并在所有这些方面做出贡献。
[00:32:01.110] you as an adult should not be seeking a child's validation. And I think that's where a lot of
[00:32:01.110] 作为成年人，你不应该寻求孩子的认可。我认为很多问题就出在这里。
[00:32:07.630] that kind of falls in line with too. So if like a student pushes boundaries or like wants to follow
[00:32:07.630] 这其实也符合这种情况。所以，如果一个学生挑战界限，或者想要遵循什么规则，那也是可以的。
[00:32:13.270] you on social media, or like they want to like hang out outside of school hours, or like they're
[00:32:13.270] 你在社交媒体上，或者他们想在课余时间出去玩，或者他们就像
[00:32:16.930] flirting with you, you as a teacher should not be seeking their validation or their attention.
[00:32:16.930] 如果有人跟你调情，作为老师，你不应该寻求他们的认可或关注。
[00:32:22.410] I think this is especially interesting too, because I'm a huge TikTok person. And with social media
[00:32:22.410] 我觉得这一点也特别有趣，因为我是TikTok的忠实用户。而且随着社交媒体的发展……
[00:32:29.070] being so big now, you can actually see real life evidence of this stuff on social media. So I know
[00:32:29.070] 现在社交媒体规模这么大，你真的可以在社交媒体上看到这类事情的真实证据。所以我知道
[00:32:34.510] one of the things that was really popular a couple months ago were skits reenacting teachers who do
[00:32:34.510] 几个月前非常流行的一种形式是模仿老师的短剧。
[00:32:41.550] crave and seek that validation, especially from a female teacher who seeks like male student athlete
[00:32:41.550] 渴望并寻求这种认可，尤其来自像男学生运动员一样寻求认可的女老师。
[00:32:49.070] validation or something. So there were a lot of skits around that. And I remember watching it. And
[00:32:49.070] 算是寻求认同之类的。所以有很多相关的短剧。我记得我看过。
[00:32:53.870] not to say that our school had a lot of like predatory teachers growing up, but there are like some elements
[00:32:53.870] 并不是说我们学校有很多那种性骚扰学生的老师，但确实存在一些这样的因素。
[00:32:59.790] of it where you see it and you're like, oh, there were teachers who like, kind of would joke back with
[00:32:59.790] 当你看到它的时候，你会想，哦，有些老师会开玩笑地回应说……
[00:33:05.490] like the male students a lot more than the female students. So I don't know, I just feel like with social
[00:33:05.490] 我更喜欢男生而不是女生。所以，我不知道，我只是觉得在社交方面……
[00:33:10.850] media, being a teacher must feel a little bit different. Now, I do think so. And, you know,
[00:33:10.850] 媒体从业者和教师的感觉肯定不太一样。现在，我的确这么认为。而且，你知道，
[00:33:17.330] we went through a K through 12 education. I remember seeing teachers who give me that pick
[00:33:17.330] 我们接受了从幼儿园到高中的完整教育。我记得见过一些老师让我选择。
[00:33:22.130] me behavior. Right? Everyone carries like their own insecurity, etc. And I think it's concerning when
[00:33:22.130] 我的行为。对吧？每个人都有自己的不安全感等等。我觉得这很令人担忧，当
[00:33:30.870] that falls into their careers. And especially when they're interacting, if their career consists of
[00:33:30.870] 这属于他们的职业生涯范畴。尤其是在他们互动的时候，如果他们的职业生涯包括……
[00:33:36.390] like interacting with children. I do think that with social media, that gets hard, because sometimes it
[00:33:36.390] 比如和孩子们互动。我觉得社交媒体让这一切变得很难，因为有时候……
[00:33:44.110] feels like a double standard, right? Because as much as I am a high school teacher, I'm still
[00:33:44.110] 感觉像是双重标准，对吧？因为尽管我是一名高中老师，但我仍然
[00:33:49.010] just Hannah. And I love my job. I love what I do. But it's not all of who I am. There are like certain
[00:33:49.010] 我只是汉娜。我热爱我的工作，热爱我所做的一切。但这并不是我的全部。还有一些其他方面。
[00:33:57.290] expectations and standards, like obviously, your students should not follow you on like your own
[00:33:57.290] 期望和标准，比如很显然，你的学生不应该像你的亲生父母一样追随你。
[00:34:01.450] personal social media. And so that's why a lot of teachers will try to do like a public social media
[00:34:01.450] 个人社交媒体。所以很多老师会尝试像公开社交媒体那样运作。
[00:34:06.550] doing social media. I'm like, that's actually so much work. But I do think with social media kind
[00:34:06.550] 做社交媒体。我觉得，这其实很费劲。但我确实认为社交媒体……
[00:34:11.710] of blurs that line. Because social media enables like a parasocial relationship between you and
[00:34:11.710] 模糊了这条界限。因为社交媒体促成了你和他人之间类似准社会关系的建立。
[00:34:18.230] like the people who view your content, or your followers. And when you're a teacher, you're
[00:34:18.230] 比如浏览你内容的人，或者你的粉丝。而当你是一名教师时，你……
[00:34:25.050] supposed to stay in that realm as a teacher, when interacting with your students. I think that
[00:34:25.050] 作为一名教师，在与学生互动时，应该始终保持这种职业操守。我认为……
[00:34:31.690] social media, it's still like an ever evolving field or like industry. And I think there are some
[00:34:31.690] 社交媒体仍然是一个不断发展的领域或行业。我认为有一些
[00:34:38.790] blurred lines with that. Some people just have to use their discretion. But then I think that's where
[00:34:38.790] 这方面的界限很模糊。有些人必须自行斟酌。但我认为，这就是问题的关键所在。
[00:34:45.650] it can be kind of risky. Because again, no one knows you as a person just behind the screen.
[00:34:45.650] 这可能有点冒险。因为再说一遍，屏幕背后，没有人真正了解你。
[00:34:52.290] They can make their interpretations or these perceptions. And that can have like a lasting
[00:34:52.290] 他们可以做出自己的解读或看法。而这可能会产生持久的影响。
[00:34:58.790] or like a very negative impact on your persona.
[00:34:58.790] 或者说，对你的个人形象产生了非常负面的影响。
[00:35:03.030] Yeah, that's true. It's like a whole new section of professionalism that we are just like growing with.
[00:35:03.030] 没错，确实如此。这就像一个全新的专业领域，我们正在与之共同成长。
[00:35:09.950] Because like when we were in high school, our teachers didn't have Instagram, like maybe they
[00:35:09.950] 因为就像我们上高中的时候，我们的老师还没有Instagram，也许他们
[00:35:14.790] had Facebook. But honestly, even that was kind of rare. And so now it's like, okay, most people you
[00:35:14.790] 以前也有Facebook。但说实话，那时候用Facebook的人也很少见。所以现在的情况是，好吧，大多数人……
[00:35:20.950] bump into probably have one or the other Facebook or Instagram, you could probably find someone pretty
[00:35:20.950] 偶遇的人可能都有Facebook或Instagram，你或许能找到一个很漂亮的人。
[00:35:27.570] easily, you know, searching LinkedIn or searching the internet. You know, like those TikToks where that
[00:35:27.570] 很容易就能找到，比如在LinkedIn上搜索或者在网上搜索。你知道，就像那些TikTok视频一样。
[00:35:33.970] one girl, she just like, find someone off of a name and a profile picture. And I'm like, dude,
[00:35:33.970] 有个女孩，她就凭一个名字和一张头像就找到了对象。我就想，老兄，
[00:35:39.570] that's crazy. Like, that's the world we live in right now. It would be so easy for your students
[00:35:39.570] 太疯狂了。这就是我们现在生活的世界。这对你的学生来说太容易了。
[00:35:43.590] to just find you. And I guess at this point, it's like inevitable, right? All you can do is just
[00:35:43.590] 只是为了找到你。我想到了这一步，这就像命中注定一样，对吧？你唯一能做的就是……
[00:35:48.150] private your Instagram and like, not necessarily prevent them from finding it, but prevent them from
[00:35:48.150] 将你的Instagram账号设为私密，这样不一定能阻止别人找到它，但至少能阻止他们访问。
[00:35:54.250] following it.
[00:35:54.250] 紧随其后。
[00:35:55.170] And like the appeal social media is like, it's a very saturated industry, but you see the potential
[00:35:55.170] 就像社交媒体的吸引力一样，虽然这是一个非常饱和的行业，但你仍然能看到它的潜力。
[00:36:01.330] for it. And so there are very successful like teachers who also have like social media accounts.
[00:36:01.330] 为此，也有一些非常成功的教师拥有社交媒体账号。
[00:36:05.570] Like there's this one that I really like, and she just says, like, get ready with me in the morning.
[00:36:05.570] 比如，我特别喜欢其中一个女孩，她就说，早上跟我一起准备出门吧。
[00:36:09.770] That's like strictly most of her content. And I'm like, I want to get my bag too.
[00:36:09.770] 她的内容几乎全是这个。我就想，我也想买个包。
[00:36:17.210] I want to get like, I don't know, like skincare. I think it can be rewarding. There might be high
[00:36:17.210] 我想买点护肤品之类的东西。我觉得这会很有好处。也许会有很高的评价。
[00:36:23.750] rewards, but there's also like high risk. And it kind of depends on like what you really prioritize.
[00:36:23.750] 回报固然重要，但风险也很高。这很大程度上取决于你真正优先考虑的是什么。
[00:36:27.570] For me, like my Instagram is private, because I feel like I'm so much more open about my life on my
[00:36:27.570] 对我来说，我的Instagram账号是私密的，因为我觉得我在其他平台上会更坦诚地分享我的生活。
[00:36:33.910] Instagram. And that feels a lot more personal.
[00:36:33.910] Instagram。感觉更私人化一些。
[00:36:37.130] Dude, do you watch Abbott Elementary?
[00:36:37.130] 哥们儿，你看过《艾伯特小学》吗？
[00:36:39.790] I do watch Abbott Elementary. Not like consistently, but sometimes I watch it.
[00:36:39.790] 我确实会看《艾伯特小学》。虽然不是经常看，但偶尔会看。
[00:36:44.550] Yeah, same. I've been watching it slowly. And this kind of reminds me of that episode where like,
[00:36:44.550] 是啊，我也是。我一直在慢慢看。这让我想起有一集，大概是这样的：
[00:36:50.230] they want funding for the school. And then they post like TikToks to go viral to get money from that
[00:36:50.230] 他们想要学校的资金。然后他们像在TikTok上发布视频一样，试图通过这种方式获得病毒式传播，从而筹集资金。
[00:36:56.830] so that they can buy supplies for their students. And then the kind of like, underlying message of
[00:36:56.830] 这样他们就能为学生购买学习用品了。然后，这其中蕴含着一种潜在的信息：
[00:37:02.970] that is like, oh, is it worth it to sell our souls to social media and like post fake content or not
[00:37:02.970] 那就好像在问，为了社交媒体发布虚假内容而出卖灵魂，到底值不值得？
[00:37:08.610] necessarily real or true content, just so that we can get, you know, the money to like provide for our
[00:37:08.610] 不一定是真实或真实的内容，只是为了能拿到钱来维持我们的生计。
[00:37:15.310] kids. But yeah, I thought that was really interesting. As you said, there's potential there as a tool,
[00:37:15.310] 孩子们。不过，我觉得这真的很有意思。正如你所说，它作为一种工具很有潜力。
[00:37:20.490] but also it's a lot of work. And you have to really curate your content kind of.
[00:37:20.490] 但同时，这也需要花费大量精力。而且你必须认真地精心策划你的内容。
[00:37:26.050] Well, that's the other thing too, right? I feel like even when we were in school, there was always
[00:37:26.050] 嗯，还有一点也是，对吧？我觉得即使在我们上学的时候，也总是……
[00:37:30.350] discourse about how one, teachers are underfunded, but also to schools themselves are underfunded. So
[00:37:30.350] 讨论的焦点在于，一方面教师经费不足，另一方面学校本身也面临经费不足的问题。
[00:37:37.670] there's just not enough resources to be able to provide for students without dipping into your own
[00:37:37.670] 资源实在太少，如果不动用自己的资金，根本无法为学生提供足够的帮助。
[00:37:43.430] personal money. And do you find that that's true and also a big problem in the current day? Or do you
[00:37:43.430] 个人资金。你觉得这是事实吗？而且这在当今也是一个大问题吗？或者你觉得呢？
[00:37:49.470] think things have gotten better over the years? It really kind of depends on the district that you're
[00:37:49.470] 你觉得这些年情况有所好转吗？这其实很大程度上取决于你所在的地区。
[00:37:55.430] in. But I think even in my district that has a lot of, like we're a high performing district and
[00:37:55.430] 但我认为即使在我所在的选区，也有很多这样的例子，比如我们是一个高绩效选区，
[00:38:03.990] generally more money is funded towards schools that are not as high performing, which is totally
[00:38:03.990] 通常情况下，那些成绩不太好的学校反而会获得更多资金，这完全是无稽之谈。
[00:38:09.410] understandable. I know that in my first maybe three years of teaching, I've definitely spent a lot of
[00:38:09.410] 可以理解。我知道在我教书的头三年里，我确实花了很多时间……
[00:38:14.510] my own money to kind of curate my classroom because that's like the room that my students are in and
[00:38:14.510] 我自掏腰包布置我的教室，因为那是学生们待的地方。
[00:38:21.010] that I'm in all day. My side, definitely we can get our supplies, but we share it amongst the department.
[00:38:21.010] 我整天都在。我们这边肯定能拿到所需的物资，但要部门里其他人一起共享。
[00:38:27.990] It kind of depends on where you're living, the performance of your district, location and like
[00:38:27.990] 这在某种程度上取决于你居住的地方、你所在地区的表现、地理位置等等。
[00:38:35.010] performance. I work at a high performing district in a more middle class, high class town. And so we
[00:38:35.010] 绩效。我在一个中产阶级或上层阶级城镇的高绩效学区工作。所以我们
[00:38:44.050] definitely have like resources, but I definitely think that as like a first or a new teacher, you are
[00:38:44.050] 当然，你肯定拥有类似的资源，但我认为，作为一名新手教师，你肯定……
[00:38:49.950] definitely spending your own money to kind of curate your classroom, maybe your curriculum and all
[00:38:49.950] 你肯定要自掏腰包来布置教室，可能还要布置课程等等。
[00:38:54.950] these things. I remember doing like a fundraiser, like Donors Choose, where every time someone donates,
[00:38:54.950] 这些事。我记得我做过一个类似Donors Choose的筹款活动，每次有人捐款，
[00:39:01.330] they match that donation. And so it's really easy to get funding for it or to reach your goal.
[00:39:01.330] 他们会匹配捐款。所以，筹集资金或实现目标真的很容易。
[00:39:07.290] And I remember sharing that on my social media and like people from high school
[00:39:07.290] 我还记得我在社交媒体上分享过这件事，还有高中同学也分享过。
[00:39:11.070] like contributed and I was so moved by that because I was like, oh my gosh. And I felt very moved
[00:39:11.070] 就像有人做出了贡献一样，我深受感动，因为我当时想，天哪。我真的非常感动。
[00:39:18.250] seeing people that I've known, even people I haven't talked to, like want to contribute.
[00:39:18.250] 看到我认识的人，甚至那些我没说过话的人，都想贡献一份力量。
[00:39:22.970] Also low-key felt like I was begging for money. Yeah, I was like, I feel so moved, but why do I
[00:39:22.970] 感觉自己好像在乞讨似的。是啊，我当时想，我真的很感动，但为什么……
[00:39:32.130] feel so like, I feel so like jujuped? Like jujuped angry? Like I don't know how to say it. It's like,
[00:39:32.130] 感觉就像，感觉就像被……激怒了？就像被……激怒了？就像我不知道该怎么说。就像，
[00:39:38.210] I just feel so like, I don't know, like conflicted about it. Like having to ask for money like that.
[00:39:38.210] 我感觉很……我不知道该怎么说，很矛盾。感觉就像要开口要钱一样。
[00:39:43.970] Nevertheless, I appreciated it. I do think that as a country, we say we care about education,
[00:39:43.970] 不过，我还是很感激的。我认为，作为一个国家，我们口口声声说重视教育，
[00:39:51.610] but I think the reality is that we do not because it's not prioritized. And instead we care about
[00:39:51.610] 但我认为现实情况是我们没有这样做，因为它没有被列为优先事项。相反，我们更关心的是
[00:39:58.950] all the wrong things about education, like trying to ban books, trying to like control the curriculum
[00:39:58.950] 所有关于教育的错误做法，比如试图禁书，试图控制课程设置。
[00:40:05.190] and all these things at public schools, you know? Even though my school is like the oldest,
[00:40:05.190] 公立学校里有这么多事，你知道吗？虽然我的学校算是最古老的了，
[00:40:11.430] probably one of the oldest schools in the district, we still have like those terrible desks
[00:40:11.430] 这可能是学区里最古老的学校之一，我们仍然在使用那种破旧的课桌椅。
[00:40:15.070] where the table is connected to the seat. Still, there are some classrooms that have like the new
[00:40:15.070] 桌子和座位是连在一起的。不过，也有一些教室像新的一样。
[00:40:22.370] desk where it's literally like a actual desk and like a separate like movable chair that's just more
[00:40:22.370] 桌子，它就像一张真正的桌子，还有一把单独的、可移动的椅子，这更……
[00:40:27.230] accessible and accommodating, but not everyone has those desks and chairs. And that's been like a
[00:40:27.230] 这些设施方便易用，但并非人人都有这样的桌椅。这就好比……
[00:40:33.910] continuous issue because it feels like an equity problem. Like it doesn't feel equitable that like some
[00:40:33.910] 这个问题一直存在，因为它感觉像是一个公平问题。感觉好像有些事情不公平。
[00:40:40.950] classrooms have those chairs. I'm just like, we bring results and we do well, like all these
[00:40:40.950] 教室里都有那种椅子。我就想说，我们取得了成果，我们做得很好，就像所有这些一样。
[00:40:48.310] things were like up going above and beyond for students. Why can't we get enough funding for
[00:40:48.310] 事情就像是竭尽全力帮助学生。为什么我们无法获得足够的资金？
[00:40:52.370] everyone to have these desks, which is like the most basic thing. And so there are times where
[00:40:52.370] 每个人都需要这些桌子，这是最基本的需求。所以有时候……
[00:40:57.330] it's frustrating because it just feels like we're like going three steps forward and two steps back.
[00:40:57.330] 令人沮丧的是，感觉我们就像前进了三步，后退了两步。
[00:41:03.530] Sometimes we focus on other things that maybe as a teacher, we feel like it's not a priority
[00:41:03.530] 有时我们会把精力放在其他事情上，而作为教师，我们可能觉得这些事情并非当务之急。
[00:41:09.370] because when we look at the field of education, it's so much more than teachers. There's so many
[00:41:09.370] 因为当我们审视教育领域时，它远不止教师那么简单。它包含着太多方面。
[00:41:14.090] other components to it and who gets to like make a decision on what gets prioritized and what doesn't.
[00:41:14.090] 还有其他组成部分，以及谁有权决定哪些事情优先考虑，哪些事情不优先考虑。
[00:41:19.530] And so as a teacher, that can be frustrating because we're the ones who are actively interacting
[00:41:19.530] 所以作为教师，这可能会令人沮丧，因为我们才是积极与学生互动的人。
[00:41:23.810] with our students on a daily basis. Oh my God, I do remember when you did the fundraiser in like the
[00:41:23.810] 每天都和我们的学生在一起。哦，我的天哪，我还记得你上次搞筹款活动的时候……
[00:41:30.510] first couple of years. And as someone who donated, I feel like the vibe was not like, oh, I'm begging
[00:41:30.510] 头几年是这样。作为捐赠者，我觉得氛围并不是那种“哦，我在乞求”的感觉。
[00:41:37.650] for money. It was more like, oh my God, I do remember being underfunded at school. So like Hannah needs
[00:41:37.650] 为了钱。更像是，哦，天哪，我记得上学时经费不足。所以就像汉娜需要
[00:41:43.250] this. Thank you. I know. I know like that wasn't like, but I think just like being the one to ask for
[00:41:43.250] 谢谢你。我知道。我知道那样做不太好，但我觉得就像是主动去问一样。
[00:41:51.650] it. I was like, wow, this feels so like humbling. Because I remember like when we were in high school,
[00:41:51.650] 我当时就想，哇，这感觉真让人谦卑。因为我记得我们高中时，
[00:41:58.110] we would complain all the time about like our lockers and stuff, like just simple, basic necessities
[00:41:58.110] 我们总是抱怨一些东西，比如储物柜之类的，都是些简单基本的生活必需品。
[00:42:04.930] of school. And we were like, dude, our lockers are literally like rusting and like not okay. We were
[00:42:04.930] 学校。我们当时就想，老兄，我们的储物柜都生锈了，这可不行。我们当时
[00:42:12.110] always complaining about how old our school was or just like how little funding we had. And then we
[00:42:12.110] 总是抱怨我们学校太老旧，或者抱怨我们经费太少。然后我们
[00:42:17.650] looked at like the other schools in our district and we're like, how come they always get money?
[00:42:17.650] 我们观察了学区内的其他学校，然后就想，为什么他们总是能拿到钱？
[00:42:21.190] And we're stuck with these like half ripped textbooks, you know, like that kind of stuff.
[00:42:21.190] 而我们却只能用这些破破烂烂的教科书，你知道，就是那种东西。
[00:42:26.570] That's the memory that was triggered. And I was like, damn, Hannah's dealing with these problems
[00:42:26.570] 那是触发的记忆。我当时想，天哪，汉娜要面对这些问题。
[00:42:31.450] yet again. We must help her.
[00:42:31.450] 又一次。我们必须帮助她。
[00:42:34.370] No, like in our high school. Oh my God. The deaths were terrible. They were so like close
[00:42:34.370] 不，就像我们高中那会儿一样。我的天哪。那些死亡事件太可怕了。他们离得那么近。
[00:42:41.530] in proximity to each other. I was like, what if you have like physical needs? Like truly,
[00:42:41.530] 彼此距离很近。我就想，如果你们有生理需求怎么办？真的，
[00:42:48.950] you cannot be accommodated because the classrooms I was like, wow, they're actually really small.
[00:42:48.950] 你没法被安排进去，因为教室……我当时就想，哇，它们真的太小了。
[00:42:54.290] And it's just insane. I just remember our high school. I was like, Oh my God, I'm like at my
[00:42:54.290] 简直太疯狂了。我突然想起了我们的高中。我当时想，我的天哪，我感觉自己好像回到了高中时代。
[00:42:58.710] high school again. Like it's like one of the oldest schools in the district. We perform really
[00:42:58.710] 又回到了高中。感觉像是学区里最古老的学校之一。我们表现得非常出色。
[00:43:02.830] well, but then we look so like, we look like we have no funding. Yeah. And it was just insane.
[00:43:02.830] 但是，这样一来，我们看起来就像……看起来就像我们根本没有资金一样。是啊。简直太疯狂了。
[00:43:10.570] We had like trailers for classrooms.
[00:43:10.570] 我们当时用拖车当教室。
[00:43:13.450] Yeah.
[00:43:13.450] 是的。
[00:43:14.890] The portables. Yeah, we have portables, not like a legitimate building.
[00:43:14.890] 是活动板房。是的，我们用的是活动板房，不是正规的建筑。
[00:43:19.070] That was so insane. But a lot of that's out of the teacher's control. Like we live in a more like
[00:43:19.070] 真是太疯狂了。但很多事情老师都控制不了。就像我们生活在一个更像……
[00:43:26.310] Western like individualistic society too. And so there's a lot of hearsay that like we care about
[00:43:26.310] 西方社会也崇尚个人主义。因此，有很多传言说我们很在意……
[00:43:32.050] education, but I don't really think that's not a priority. And so that's just like something that
[00:43:32.050] 教育固然重要，但我并不认为它不是优先事项。所以，这就像是……
[00:43:38.950] always rubs me the wrong way. I'm like, you could say you don't care about education. We can't get
[00:43:38.950] 这总让我很不舒服。我就想说，你根本不在乎教育。我们没法……
[00:43:45.270] you to care. Yeah. But don't pretend like you care when you clearly don't, you know? And so.
[00:43:45.270] 你要关心。是啊。但别明明不在乎却假装在乎，明白吗？所以。
[00:43:53.730] I feel like talking to you about your experience as a teacher has been so eye-opening because
[00:43:53.730] 我觉得和你聊聊你的教学经历让我受益匪浅，因为
[00:43:59.650] in a very simple sense, being a teacher is like guiding your students through your curriculum.
[00:43:59.650] 从最简单的意义上讲，当老师就像引导学生学习课程一样。
[00:44:05.190] But there's so many added layers that you talked us through today of navigating the social needs of
[00:44:05.190] 但您今天和我们详细讲解的关于如何应对社会需求的诸多方面，还有很多值得探讨的层面。
[00:44:11.730] a student and also navigating like the funding and resources aspect. And also knowing like the school
[00:44:11.730] 作为一名学生，还要了解资金和资源等方面的情况。还要了解学校的情况。
[00:44:17.430] and the various departments to make sure your students are feeling the most supported. Like
[00:44:17.430] 以及各个部门，以确保您的学生感受到最大的支持。例如
[00:44:21.250] all of these things feel like so much additional expectations that you kind of layer on top of
[00:44:21.250] 所有这些都感觉像是额外的期望，层层叠加在……之上。
[00:44:27.910] just your like true duty of teaching your students a curriculum. So in many ways, I feel like being a
[00:44:27.910] 就像你真正的职责是教学生课程一样。所以在很多方面，我觉得成为一名……
[00:44:33.110] teacher is very thankless or like receiving less thanks than it deserves because you're kind of
[00:44:33.110] 老师很不知感恩，或者说得到的感谢远少于应得的，因为你有点……
[00:44:40.790] raising the young generation for like a decent portion of their days. I don't know like if it's
[00:44:40.790] 在年轻一代成长的相当长一段时间里，他们都在为之付出。我不知道这是否……
[00:44:47.450] like a toxic mentality to just be like, oh, that just comes with the territory. And I do think that is a
[00:44:47.450] 这是一种有害的心态，认为“哦，这是不可避免的”。而且我确实认为这是一种
[00:44:53.670] toxic. But I'm sure like, especially from an outside perspective, it must sound like a lot. And I think
[00:44:53.670] 有毒的。但我确信，尤其从旁观者的角度来看，这听起来肯定很刺耳。而且我认为
[00:45:01.430] a lot of it does build up. If you're trying to support your students, and that's not even including like the
[00:45:01.430] 很多事情确实会累积起来。如果你想支持你的学生，这甚至还不包括诸如……
[00:45:07.950] instruction, right? And the curriculum building that we do. And a lot of adjustments that we make,
[00:45:07.950] 教学方面，对吧？还有我们所做的课程建设。以及我们做出的许多调整。
[00:45:13.710] because we want our students to succeed, but we also want them to strive for excellence.
[00:45:13.710] 因为我们希望学生取得成功，但我们也希望他们追求卓越。
[00:45:19.850] How do we hold them to high standards? How do we get them to meet those standards, be proficient,
[00:45:19.850] 我们如何对他们提出高要求？我们如何让他们达到这些标准，熟练掌握相关技能？
[00:45:25.250] but also be like, okay, well, now that you've met those standards, like there's also you should try
[00:45:25.250] 但也要像这样说，好吧，既然你已经达到了这些标准，那么你也应该尝试一下。
[00:45:30.170] strive for excellence. I think when it comes to like being a teacher with like most careers, I feel like
[00:45:30.170] 力求卓越。我觉得，就像大多数职业一样，当老师也是如此。
[00:45:37.150] and just like our living costs, like our salaries have not increased like exponentially to meet like
[00:45:37.150] 就像我们的生活成本一样，我们的工资并没有呈指数级增长以满足需求。
[00:45:42.870] the demands of our economy right now. You know, people say salary is a scam. I 100% agree.
[00:45:42.870] 这就是我们当前经济形势的需求。你知道，人们常说薪水是个骗局。我完全同意。
[00:45:51.190] Because there are so many more responsibilities outside of your actual like contracted hours.
[00:45:51.190] 因为除了合同规定的工作时间之外，你还有许多其他的责任需要承担。
[00:45:56.730] Yeah. And sometimes that's like chaperoning events, or being like a club advisor, doing what
[00:45:56.730] 是的。有时候就像是担任活动的监护人，或者像社团顾问一样，做各种各样的事情。
[00:46:02.830] we call adjunct duty. And that can vary per school side or per district. But there are a lot of after
[00:46:02.830] 我们称之为兼职工作。具体情况可能因学校或学区而异。但之后还有很多其他工作。
[00:46:09.630] school hours. Granted, of course, people are quick to point out that we have our vacations.
[00:46:09.630] 学校作息时间。当然，人们很快就会指出我们还有假期。
[00:46:14.650] And I don't think people understand that this job is not sustainable without those vacations. Because
[00:46:14.650] 我觉得人们并不明白，如果没有这些假期，这份工作是无法持续的。因为
[00:46:21.930] if you have gone through a public school, if you went through a traditional nine month school year,
[00:46:21.930] 如果你上过公立学校，如果你经历过传统的九个月学年，
[00:46:26.810] you know what it was like being a student, right? And you needed those vacations. There are some
[00:46:26.810] 你知道当学生是什么滋味吧？你肯定也需要假期。有些
[00:46:32.830] year round schools, where they kind of break up their vacation dates differently. And I think that also
[00:46:32.830] 全年制学校的假期安排方式不太一样。而且我认为这一点也很重要。
[00:46:38.270] makes it more sustainable. But you will take work home. And I think the longer the more
[00:46:38.270] 这样更可持续。但你会把工作带回家。而且我认为时间越长，
[00:46:43.950] years you put into teaching, the faster you get at your grading. But sometimes life happens, right?
[00:46:43.950] 教龄越长，批改作业的速度就越快。但人生难免会遇到一些变故，对吧？
[00:46:49.630] Maybe you get married, maybe you have children, and like all these things. But you will always have work
[00:46:49.630] 也许你会结婚，也许你会生孩子，也许你会喜欢所有这些事情。但你永远都会有工作。
[00:46:54.550] to do outside of your contracted hours. If we need to be out because I'm sick, or like we have like an
[00:46:54.550] 在合同规定的工作时间之外进行的工作。如果我生病了需要请假，或者像我们遇到其他事情一样……
[00:47:02.590] emergency, we have to create lesson plans for our subs. Sometimes you have great subs. And like this is
[00:47:02.590] 紧急情况下，我们得为代课老师准备教案。有时候你会遇到很棒的代课老师。就像这样……
[00:47:10.850] like, I appreciate all our subs. But sometimes there are certain lessons that are very teacher centered.
[00:47:10.850] 我很感谢所有的代课老师。但有时候，某些课程确实非常以老师为中心。
[00:47:18.030] And it's hard for a sub to do, you know, so sometimes it's just like, Oh, I needed to get
[00:47:18.030] 你知道，这对替补来说很难，所以有时候就会想，哦，我需要去……
[00:47:22.690] this done. But like, I can't like 100% rely on the sub if you don't know them. That's just like,
[00:47:22.690] 这件事办完了。但是，如果你不认识他们，就不能百分百依赖这个子版块。这就像是……
[00:47:30.390] very interesting to me. Because I feel like, oh, if people are out sick, I don't feel like they have to
[00:47:30.390] 我觉得这很有意思。因为我觉得，哦，如果有人生病请假，我觉得他们没必要……
[00:47:34.030] delegate or sometimes like we have to have something in place. Yeah. Because just because we're out
[00:47:34.030] 委派任务，或者有时候我们需要事先做好安排。是的。因为仅仅因为我们不在
[00:47:39.610] sick doesn't mean the students have a day off, essentially. There are a lot of other factors
[00:47:39.610] 生病并不意味着学生就可以放假。还有很多其他因素需要考虑。
[00:47:44.450] that go into teaching. If you don't have community, you will burn out 100%. And so it's super important
[00:47:44.450] 这些都是教学中需要投入的。如果没有社群的支持，你肯定会筋疲力尽。所以，这一点至关重要。
[00:47:51.590] as a teacher to have community. I think that's kind of what has helped me in my teaching career.
[00:47:51.590] 作为一名教师，我非常需要社群。我认为这对我的教学生涯大有裨益。
[00:47:58.870] I find the job very fulfilling. When you work with your students, and you see them every day,
[00:47:58.870] 我觉得这份工作很有成就感。当你和学生们一起工作，每天都能见到他们，
[00:48:03.970] and you see those like light bulb moments where they get it, or they kind of reach a potential
[00:48:03.970] 你会看到他们灵光一闪的时刻，他们明白了，或者达到了某种潜力。
[00:48:10.770] they didn't anticipate existing within themselves, it makes it feel like all the work pays off. And
[00:48:10.770] 他们没想到自己身上会存在这样的特质，这让他们觉得所有的努力都得到了回报。
[00:48:17.770] you've and I think what it is, is like, when you're a teacher, you're investing in a future that
[00:48:17.770] 我认为，当你成为一名教师时，你就是在投资未来。
[00:48:21.750] you will not see immediately. Or that's what investing is, right? Essentially, it's, you're putting
[00:48:21.750] 你不会马上看到效果。或者说，这就是投资的本质，对吧？本质上，就是你把钱投入到投资中。
[00:48:28.090] out all this time and this work. And maybe you won't see those results in your time with them.
[00:48:28.090] 投入了这么多时间和精力，也许你最终还是看不到成果。
[00:48:34.650] Sometimes that's like, just the way it is, you know, but if I know that, like these students,
[00:48:34.650] 有时候事情就是这样，你知道吗？但如果我知道这一点，就像这些学生一样，
[00:48:38.970] if I know I'm helping them build these skills and these capacities, and like also redirecting them
[00:48:38.970] 如果我知道我正在帮助他们培养这些技能和能力，并且也在引导他们走向正确的方向。
[00:48:45.090] to like be good, decent humans, it just makes the job worthwhile, you know. But that cannot be the
[00:48:45.090] 做个善良正直的人，这样工作才有意义，你知道吗？但这不应该是……
[00:48:51.750] only thing that sustains you in this career. Yeah, people are like, Oh, do it for the children,
[00:48:51.750] 这是你在这个行业里唯一能支撑你下去的东西。是啊，人们会说，哦，为了孩子们，你才这么做的。
[00:48:56.090] do for the kids. I'm like, that's not a fair standard and expectation to hold teachers. Because
[00:48:56.090] 为了孩子们好吗？我觉得，这对老师来说不是公平的标准和期望。因为
[00:49:02.270] at the end of the day, this is still a job. Like none of us are doing this for free. Some people I
[00:49:02.270] 说到底，这仍然是一份工作。我们谁也不是白干的。有些人……
[00:49:07.830] think will do exactly what they need to do, or what is kind of asked of them according to their
[00:49:07.830] 他们认为他们会完全按照自己的需要去做，或者按照别人要求他们做的事情去做。
[00:49:11.910] contract. And then other people will do more. And that's really up to their discretion. Because
[00:49:11.910] 合同。然后其他人会做更多。这完全取决于他们的自由裁量权。因为
[00:49:15.870] at the end of the day, this is a job. And I also do think that like, if you want like x, y,
[00:49:15.870] 说到底，这只是一份工作。而且我也认为，如果你想要像x、y之类的东西，
[00:49:20.710] y, you want this much more, these results, like you also have to incentivize or support your staff,
[00:49:20.710] 是的，你更想要这些结果，就像你也需要激励或支持你的员工一样。
[00:49:27.330] because it's not realistic to expect everyone to be intrinsically motivated. Like our students are not
[00:49:27.330] 因为指望每个人都有内在动力是不现实的。就像我们的学生一样，他们就没有。
[00:49:34.690] intrinsically motivated, they're trying to get good grades, they're trying to go to college,
[00:49:34.690] 他们出于内在动力，努力取得好成绩，努力上大学。
[00:49:38.290] they're trying to secure their future. There might be some students who are there for the pursuit of
[00:49:38.290] 他们正在努力保障自己的未来。可能有些学生是为了追求……
[00:49:42.910] knowledge. And those students still exist, but it's not as high, you know, as it maybe was like
[00:49:42.910] 知识水平。而且这些学生仍然存在，但他们的水平不如以前那么高了，你知道吗？
[00:49:50.370] years ago. And as teachers, like, yes, we're in it for the students, you're not in teaching if you're
[00:49:50.370] 几年前。作为教师，没错，我们是为了学生而教书，如果你不是……那就不是当老师了。
[00:49:57.510] not invested in the students. But that cannot be the only thing that pushes you forward and keeps you
[00:49:57.510] 没有对学生投入太多精力。但这不应该是你前进和坚持下去的唯一动力。
[00:50:04.450] going. Like we should have sustainable like salaries. And you need to have a good support system
[00:50:04.450] 继续前进。比如我们应该有可持续的薪资水平。而且你需要一个良好的支持系统。
[00:50:10.130] as a working adult. Yeah, for sure. And I think as an outsider, it's easy to forget how much of a
[00:50:10.130] 作为一名职场人士。是的，当然。而且我觉得作为局外人，很容易忘记这有多么重要。
[00:50:17.810] handful a classroom of 20 kids can be. In a non teacher job, we interact with a lot of people as
[00:50:17.810] 管理一个有20个孩子的班级可能相当棘手。在非教师岗位上，我们会与很多人互动。
[00:50:26.850] well. And you know, it can be tiring. But these are like adults, you're like literally handling like
[00:50:26.850] 嗯。你知道，这会很累。但这些人就像成年人一样，你真的要像对待成年人一样对待他们。
[00:50:32.170] kids, right? It's a whole different thing. So I feel like it's really easy to forget how different that
[00:50:32.170] 孩子，对吧？那完全是两码事。所以我感觉人们很容易忘记这两者之间的区别。
[00:50:38.810] can be. You forget how much of a like, nuisance you yourself were as a teenager. I want to add to
[00:50:38.810] 确实如此。你忘了自己青少年时期有多讨人厌、多令人讨厌。我想补充一点……
[00:50:46.250] like in a public school, it's rare to have that low of a number of students. Oh, right. I think when
[00:50:46.250] 就像公立学校一样，学生人数这么少的情况很少见。哦，对。我想当
[00:50:52.670] I first when I was student teaching, I think there was like a period that had like 34 or 36 students.
[00:50:52.670] 我第一次实习的时候，好像有一段时间带了 34 或 36 个学生。
[00:50:59.750] And there are schools that have like almost 39 students per period. Yeah, it's a lot. So I think
[00:50:59.750] 有些学校每节课差不多有39个学生。是啊，很多。所以我觉得
[00:51:07.250] the range is truly anywhere from like maybe 28 to like, at least your mid 30s. I think just like
[00:51:07.250] 范围确实很广，大概从28岁到至少30多岁都有可能。我觉得就像……
[00:51:14.710] not at my side in particular, but just like across the board. It's a lot of students. And those students,
[00:51:14.710] 不只是我这边，而是所有学生都是如此。有很多学生。而这些学生，
[00:51:20.770] they might have different needs, they might have IEPs, they might have 504s. And IEPs are like
[00:51:20.770] 他们的需求可能不同，他们可能需要制定个别化教育计划 (IEP)，也可能需要 504 计划。而个别化教育计划就像……
[00:51:27.130] individualized education plans. And therefore students who might need like certain accommodations,
[00:51:27.130] 个性化教育计划。因此，有些学生可能需要某些特殊安排，
[00:51:31.470] because maybe they have ADHD, or they are emotionally disturbed, or they have certain like health needs.
[00:51:31.470] 因为他们可能患有注意力缺陷多动障碍，或者情绪不稳定，或者有某些健康方面的需求。
[00:51:40.610] You have to also accommodate them. And you'll have a variety of them in your classes.
[00:51:40.610] 你还得照顾到他们。而且你的班级里会有各种各样的人。
[00:51:45.890] Dude, and for us, it's very rare for us to even have a meeting with 30 people.
[00:51:45.890] 老兄，对我们来说，开30人的会议都非常罕见。
[00:51:50.690] Yeah, dude, I have this like very distinct memory of going up to do a presentation in one of my classes
[00:51:50.690] 是啊，兄弟，我清楚地记得有一次在课堂上做报告。
[00:51:57.630] in high school. And it was a classroom where everyone faces the same way, like up to the front
[00:51:57.630] 高中时。那是一间教室，所有人的座位都朝向同一个方向，比如都面向前面。
[00:52:03.070] with like the where the teacher is. And when you're doing your presentation, you're getting the teacher
[00:52:03.070] 就像老师所在的地方一样。当你做演示的时候，你就能听到老师的声音。
[00:52:08.130] view, right? I remember looking to do the presentation and seeing like 40 pairs of eyes and being like,
[00:52:08.130] 没错吧？我记得当时准备做演示的时候，看到大概有40双眼睛，心想：
[00:52:13.730] holy shit, this is what our teacher sees every day. Yeah.
[00:52:13.730] 我的天哪，这就是我们老师每天都看到的景象。是啊。
[00:52:20.330] Definitely mildly terrifying. But I think I feel so grateful for teachers like you, Hannah,
[00:52:20.330] 确实有点吓人。但我很感激像你这样的老师，汉娜。
[00:52:25.610] and everyone else who kind of holds it down for the young generation. And I completely agree that
[00:52:25.610] 还有所有那些为年轻一代撑起一片天的人。我完全同意。
[00:52:32.170] we need to be paying our teachers more, we need to be funding our schools more, because this is a
[00:52:32.170] 我们需要提高教师的工资，我们需要增加学校的经费，因为这是一个
[00:52:37.730] fairly complex and nuanced job. And also a very important one to kind of hold our society up in
[00:52:37.730] 这是一项相当复杂且需要细致入微的工作。而且，它对于支撑我们社会的发展也至关重要。
[00:52:44.430] the future. So thank you so much for coming on and sharing your experiences with us of being a teacher.
[00:52:44.430] 未来。非常感谢您抽出时间来和我们分享您的教师经历。
