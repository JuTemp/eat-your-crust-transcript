[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. I think usually whenever we do episodes about relationships and like sticky relationship situations, it always does really well. So we thought we would approach this in a different angle and talk about sticky friendship situations. Because let's face it, friendships, relationships, they're very similar at the end of the day.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。我觉得我们每次做关于人际关系，或者棘手的感情问题的节目时，反响都特别好。所以我们想换个角度，聊聊棘手的友情问题。因为说到底，友情和爱情，归根结底其实很相似。
[00:00:35.970] And there's always room for weirdness or just things that happen in the nuances of relationships that make you take a pause and think about what to do. So we thought we would come with some interesting situations and put ourselves in these hypothetical shoes. But the first one, I think Crystal, only you can answer. So I'm going to start off with this. How do you react or what would you say or do if you found out your friend was dating your sibling?
[00:00:35.970] 人际关系中总会有些奇怪或微妙之处，让你停下来思考该如何应对。所以我们想提出一些有趣的假设情境，让自己设身处地地思考。但第一个问题，我想只有你才能回答，Crystal。那我就先问你：如果你发现你的朋友在和你的兄弟姐妹谈恋爱，你会作何反应？你会说什么？你会怎么做？
[00:01:05.970] Oh my god. Are they like a close friend? Let's say they're pretty close. Ooh, okay. I think I would have initial shock. Like, really? My brother? But then also like low-key, I think it was during high school. I was like, if my brother were to date anyone though, low-key dating a friend is kind of lit because you would see them all the time.
[00:01:05.970] 我的天哪。他们是那种很要好的朋友吗？这么说吧，关系相当不错。哦，好吧。我想我一开始会很震惊。真的吗？我哥哥？但后来，我又觉得，大概是在高中时期，如果我哥哥要谈恋爱，和朋友低调地谈恋爱其实挺酷的，因为这样就能经常见到他们了。
[00:01:27.110] But, you know, I think it's just weird either way. Because then you would see your friend in a different way. Like, you would see them in a relationship. Not only that, but like at family events too. True. It's a little weird to like wrap your head around. And then the other part is weird because you'll see your sibling act in a very relationship-y way. Oh my god. I guess it goes both ways too because, like you said, your friend would come to all the holidays, like Thanksgiving, whatever.
[00:01:27.110] 但是，你知道，我觉得无论哪种情况都很奇怪。因为那样你就会用不同的眼光看待你的朋友。比如，你会看到他们谈恋爱。不仅如此，在家庭聚会上也会看到他们。没错。这有点让人难以接受。另一方面也很奇怪，因为你会看到你的兄弟姐妹表现得像一对情侣。我的天哪。我想反过来也一样，因为就像你说的，你的朋友会来参加所有的节日，比如感恩节之类的。
[00:01:56.830] But also, at your friend hangouts, especially if your close friend is in the same friend group, would you have to see your brother all the time? Oh my god. Wait, you're freaking right. And I guess there's also always the case of if something goes wrong or maybe your friend and your brother have a fight, you would definitely always be the go-to. Because I know your brother would be like, Crystal, like I need your help trying to understand what she wants or like how she's feeling right now.
[00:01:56.830] 但是，在朋友们聚会的时候，特别是如果你的好朋友也在同一个朋友圈里，你是不是得一直见到你哥哥？我的天哪。等等，你说的完全正确。而且，如果出了什么事，或者你的朋友和你哥哥吵架了，你肯定总是她们的首选求助对象。因为我知道你哥哥会说：“克丽丝塔尔，我需要你的帮助，才能明白她想要什么，或者她现在是什么感受。”
[00:02:24.810] And then your friend would probably go to you, I would assume, and be like, okay, can you give me some more context about like why your brother is acting like this or like what he wants right now? Yeah. So it would just put you in a weird spot. All I could say is, damn, I don't know, man. Okay, but I do think because my brother and I are not too different in age, he's only two years older, if he were to date one of my peers, it's not that bad. Yeah.
[00:02:24.810] 然后你朋友大概会来问你，我猜是这样，然后说，你能跟我说说你弟弟为什么这样吗？或者他现在到底想要什么？是啊。所以这会让你很尴尬。我只能说，哎，我也不知道。好吧，不过我觉得，因为我和我弟弟年龄差距不大，他只比我大两岁，所以如果他跟我的同龄人谈恋爱，也没什么大不了的。是啊。
[00:02:54.740] If someone who's my age, who I would probably be able to get along with and all of that, ultimately, it's not a bad thing, but it would be weird if it was like a close friend. That's true. Do you think it would change anything for you if this relationship was kept a secret and then you found out accidentally? Or if they like came and approached you and sat you down and like talked you through it? Whoa. I guess I would probably wonder why it was kept a secret because I don't think I would be mad or anything.
[00:02:54.740] 如果对方和我同龄，而且我应该能相处融洽，总之，这最终不是什么坏事，但如果是关系很亲密的朋友，那就有点奇怪了。确实如此。你觉得如果这段关系一直保密，然后你偶然发现，或者对方主动来找你，和你坐下来好好谈谈，你会有什么感觉吗？哇。我想我可能会好奇为什么要保密，因为我应该不会生气什么的。
[00:03:23.020] I'd probably just be like, whoa, okay, I guess. I guess the only reason would be maybe they want to test it out and make sure it's legit before looping in important people in their lives. That's fair. I guess this is also a little hard to imagine just because I can't imagine anyone in like our friend group dating my brother.
[00:03:23.020] 我大概会觉得，哇，好吧，我猜是这样。我猜唯一的解释可能是他们想先试探一下，确保没问题，再让生活中重要的人知道。这倒也说得通。不过，这事儿有点儿难以想象，因为我实在想象不出我们朋友圈里有人会跟我哥谈恋爱。
[00:03:47.700] You're like pulling in your social network comparing it to your brother's preferences. I'm like, I don't know if the girls would want to date him and I don't know if he would want to date those girls. Ooh, okay. You know what? Do you think it changes anything if we reverse the situation? So say you started dating one of your brother's friends. Oh my God. Like how would he react? Dude, I actually don't know.
[00:03:47.700] 你就像是在把你的社交圈里的人都拉过来，然后跟你哥的喜好比较。我就想，我不知道那些女生会不会想跟他约会，也不知道他会不会想跟那些女生约会。哦，好吧。你知道吗？你觉得如果我们反过来想，情况会有什么不同吗？比如说，你开始跟你哥的一个朋友约会。我的天哪。他会作何反应？老兄，我真的不知道。
[00:04:16.760] In like high school, for example, people that I was friends with who are also friends with my brother were usually girls. They wouldn't really be dudes. Oh. Because I never like befriended his guy friends before. Yeah. Or we never had like mutual guy friends, I guess. But I guess I have dated people in his year and he didn't really have much of reaction to that.
[00:04:16.760] 比如在高中，我跟我哥也是朋友的那些人，通常都是女生。男生就很少见。哦，因为我以前从来没跟他那些男性朋友交过朋友。是啊，或者说我们以前没有共同的男性朋友吧。不过我跟他同级的男生谈过恋爱，他好像也没什么特别的反应。
[00:04:46.060] You guys are the most nonchalant siblings ever. So this kind of makes sense. I could totally envision you both being like, okay. And just leaving it at that. That's like the full convo. Okay. Yeah. I actually have no idea how my brother would react. If it was like one of his friends. He'd probably be like, what the fuck? My theory is he would be like, what the fuck? Okay, I guess.
[00:04:46.060] 你们俩真是史上最淡定的兄妹了。所以这事儿也说得通。我完全能想象你们俩会说，好吧。然后就没下文了。对话就这么结束了。好吧。是啊。我其实不知道我哥会作何反应。如果换成他朋友的话，他大概会说，卧槽？我猜他会说，卧槽？好吧，我猜。
[00:05:16.060] Wait, Jisoo, do you have any cousins around this area? Like in the States or anything? Yeah, I do. Okay. What if you dated one of your cousin's friends? Or your cousin dated one of your friends? I think it would be really weird. Weird. My cousins in the US, they're not direct cousins of mine. We're so cool, but they're not really, really close family. So I guess it's kind of different.
[00:05:16.060] 等等，Jisoo，你在这附近有表兄弟姐妹吗？比如在美国之类的？嗯，有。好吧。如果你和表兄弟姐妹的朋友谈恋爱呢？或者你的表兄弟姐妹和你的朋友谈恋爱？我觉得会很奇怪。真的很奇怪。我在美国也有表兄弟姐妹，但他们不是我的直系亲属。我们关系很好，但他们并不是很亲近的家人。所以我觉得情况有点不一样。
[00:05:43.400] But I think what you said before resonates of like, you're so used to seeing these people as family or like as just friends. And then to mix them in the different categories is really weird. I feel like it would work out well if you knew these two would be a good match. Oh, true, true. And you're good friends with them and you're excited for them to like join the family. But not just for your selfish reasons of them joining the family. Because they're also compatible.
[00:05:43.400] 但我觉得你之前说的很有道理，你习惯了把这些人当家人或朋友看待。然后突然把他们混为一谈，感觉很奇怪。我觉得如果你知道这两个人很般配，那就没问题了。哦，对，对。你和他们是好朋友，你也很高兴他们能加入这个家庭。但不仅仅是出于你希望他们加入家庭的私心，而是因为他们也很合得来。
[00:06:13.860] Damn, honestly, it's probably a good thing that I'm an only child. Or maybe I can only say this because I'm an only child. But I feel like if I had a sibling, I would constantly be trying to match me. Oh my God. If they were ever single, I would be like, you should talk to my friend or try to set them up with people just all the time. In high school, I think I jokingly offered up my brother to friends before. But like very jokingly. Yeah.
[00:06:13.860] 说真的，我可能是独生子女吧，也许这反而是件好事。或者说，我之所以这么说，可能正是因为我是独生子女。但我觉得，如果我有兄弟姐妹，我肯定会不停地想办法撮合他们。天哪。如果他们单身，我肯定会说，你应该跟我朋友聊聊，或者不停地给他们介绍对象。高中时，我好像还开玩笑地向朋友推荐过我弟弟。不过，真的是开玩笑啦。嗯。
[00:06:43.000] Because once I started thinking about it more like, oh my God, would I actually want these people to date? I think it could be nice in a way of like always having a bestie at family gatherings. Yeah, that's true. If anything, you have the leg up on your sibling. Like you're closer to their significant other than they even are. True. You have ammo now. Yeah. Okay, so next question. And this is kind of a tough one.
[00:06:43.000] 因为当我开始认真思考这个问题时，比如，天哪，我真的希望这些人谈恋爱吗？我觉得这在某种程度上挺好的，就像在家庭聚会上总有个好朋友一样。是啊，没错。如果非要说有什么优势的话，那就是你比你的兄弟姐妹更有优势。你和他们的另一半的关系甚至比他们自己还亲近。没错。你现在有筹码了。好的，下一个问题。这个问题有点难。
[00:07:12.840] Your best friend confessed to you that she is cheating on her SO. What do you do? Oh my God. Am I close to the SO? Ooh. Let's say you're like decently close. Okay, that makes it harder. Because I feel like on the one side, if like you're not really close to the SO, then it's easier to just focus on talking to your friend.
[00:07:12.840] 你最好的朋友向你坦白她出轨了。你会怎么做？天哪。我和她伴侣关系亲近吗？哦。假设你们关系还算不错。好吧，那就更难了。因为我觉得一方面，如果你和她伴侣关系不是特别亲密，那你就可以更专注于和朋友谈谈。
[00:07:39.840] Hey, I think you should figure this out and talk to your SO and come clean or take the appropriate steps to like not make such a tangled up mess. But if you're close to both parties, then it's like you want your friend to do the right thing. But then part of you wants to tell the SO that's your friend too. Right. And then it's like, oh God, what is the right steps to take here?
[00:07:39.840] 嘿，我觉得你应该好好想想，跟你的伴侣谈谈，坦白一切，或者采取适当的措施，别让事情变得这么复杂。但如果你跟双方关系都很好，你既希望你的朋友能做正确的事，又想告诉你的伴侣，毕竟他也是你的朋友。对吧？然后你就会想，天哪，到底该怎么做才对呢？
[00:08:07.280] That's a really good point because the genders could always be reversed too. Or depending on who you're closer with, there's always that kind of expectation of allegiance in a sense or loyalty. Or, you know, at the very least, it's like if someone else knew that I got cheated on, I would also want to know. And that feeling is mutual for a lot of people. So it would be tough.
[00:08:07.280] 这一点说得很有道理，因为性别也可能反过来。或者说，关系越亲近，就越会有一种忠诚或效忠的期待。你知道，至少，如果别人知道我被劈腿了，我也会想知道。很多人都有这种感觉。所以，这确实很棘手。
[00:08:31.340] Do you think you would have to do the thing of, okay, if you don't tell this person soon, I would feel obligated to tell that person? Yeah, I think that's a powerful move. It's a good one. But then also, I think you have to be prepared for the shit show that's about to go down. Ooh, yeah. Because now you're one of the people who knows. So you also have to mentally prepare. You know, one of these people might come to you now. It's so messy. Clear your schedule.
[00:08:31.340] 你觉得你是不是应该这样想：好吧，如果你不尽快告诉这个人，我就有义务告诉那个人？嗯，我觉得这招挺厉害的，挺好的。但同时，我觉得你也得做好准备，迎接接下来可能发生的混乱。哦，对。因为现在你也是知情者之一了。所以你也得做好心理准备。你知道，这些人里可能有人会来找你。这事儿太乱了。赶紧把时间清空吧。
[00:09:03.280] Honestly, stuff like this, I think, takes such an emotional toll on you. Even if you're not a really involved party, just like the act of knowing can be a lot of pressure sometimes. Yeah, for sure. I think I would just really mull on like how to approach this situation because the person being cheated on, I would want them to know, to somehow find out. Ideally, it's through a conversation with their partner.
[00:09:03.280] 说实话，我觉得这种事真的会让人很崩溃。就算你不是直接当事人，光是知道这件事本身就可能压力很大。没错，确实如此。我觉得我会好好想想该怎么处理这种情况，因为被背叛的那个人，我希望他/她能知道，最好是能以某种方式发现。理想情况下，最好是通过和伴侣的谈话。
[00:09:29.320] But like can't be leaving a fellow girl in a bad situation like that. Yeah, this one is kind of tough. I mean, I think part of me is also wondering though. Ideally, everyone would be open and honest and communicative with each other. But there are times where it doesn't flow that way. The last thing that I would want to do is throw myself in there. So if I'm being fully honest, there are definitely going to be times where I would not tell the SO.
[00:09:29.320] 但我不能让一个女孩陷入那样的困境。是啊，这确实有点难。我的意思是，我其实也有点犹豫。理想情况下，每个人都应该坦诚相待、互相沟通。但有时候事情并非总是如此。我最不想做的就是让自己卷入其中。所以说实话，肯定有些时候我不会告诉我的另一半。
[00:09:57.360] And I would just do what I think I should say to my friend to support that person. And then just like leave it at that. Maybe like try to guide your friend, the one who confessed, to a hopefully good direction of what they should do next. But you can't control your friend and you can't control the outcome. And I think what's really scary is say you give a piece of advice to your friend and then they'd carry it out.
[00:09:57.360] 我会尽我所能地安慰我的朋友，然后就到此为止。或许我会试着引导一下那个坦白的朋友，希望他/她接下来能朝着正确的方向前进。但你无法控制你的朋友，也无法控制结果。我觉得真正可怕的是，你给了朋友一些建议，结果他/她真的照做了。
[00:10:26.000] And then what happens is not what your friend wanted in the first place. Or it just like spirals out of control and becomes like a whole situation. Which since the cheating, it already has been a situation. But I wouldn't want the consequences to fall back on me as a friend as well. That's fair. That's fair. You don't want to get dragged into the mess and like blamed or something like that. Yeah, yeah. So I think I would suss it out.
[00:10:26.000] 然后，事情的发展就不是你朋友一开始想要的了。或者事情就失控了，变成了一团乱麻。自从出轨以来，情况就已经很糟糕了。但作为朋友，我也不想承担后果。这很公平。这很公平。你不想被卷入这场混乱，然后被指责什么的。是啊，是啊。所以我觉得你应该好好想想办法。
[00:10:55.880] What do I think this couple needs? And then just say my piece. If I'm really, really close to the SO, then I would definitely have to give it another thought. But if we're like close, but only through the friend, I probably wouldn't say something. Yeah, that's true. It's like, I don't want to give you some sort of lecture on like morals. But maybe I'll just share my thoughts because this person brought the situation up.
[00:10:55.880] 我觉得这对情侣需要什么？然后我就说说我的看法。如果我和他们的伴侣关系非常非常亲密，那我肯定会再三考虑。但如果我们只是通过朋友认识，关系还算不错，那我可能就不会说什么了。是啊，没错。我不想给你上一堂道德课。但既然是这个人提起这件事，我也许会分享一下我的想法。
[00:11:22.080] Like, oh, well, you know, maybe this is like something you need to think about more. What does this mean? You know? Oh, but I have a question. Would you monitor the situation? Like, would you follow up on it? Oh, dude. I wish I could say I wouldn't, but I totally would. I mean, I think the reality is that unfortunately, once you tell someone of anything, they can't help but keep that in their memory. It's true.
[00:11:22.080] 比如，哦，你知道，也许你需要好好想想这件事。这意味着什么？你知道吗？哦，但我有个问题。你会关注这件事吗？你会跟进吗？哦，老兄。我真希望我不会，但我肯定会。我的意思是，我觉得现实是，不幸的是，一旦你告诉别人某件事，他们就无法忘记。这是真的。
[00:11:52.500] And this is the whole thing of when you see someone that you haven't seen in a long time and then you chat with them. Sometimes the things that your friend would bring up about you to like catch up with you might be something that happened years ago. That's like irrelevant to you now. But because they only know you in the context of your conversations, you can't help but talk about it. Yeah. Which is why I think sometimes when you see high school friends or college friends, you often bring up memories of high school days or college days and whatnot. And I think this is the same thing.
[00:11:52.500] 这就是当你见到很久没见的朋友，然后和他们聊天时会发生的情况。有时候，朋友为了和你叙旧而提起的那些事，可能都是几年前发生的，对你来说早已无关紧要。但因为他们只在你们的谈话中了解你，所以你忍不住会聊起这些。是啊。这就是为什么我觉得有时候见到高中或大学朋友，你会经常提起高中或大学时的回忆。我觉得这和现在的情况是一样的。
[00:12:21.900] Every time I would see this person, at least for a little bit, I might think about what happened. You're like, oh my God, this person is a cheater. I think I would just be like, I need to know what happened next or something. That's fair. That's like the natural curiosity, I think. Okay. Actually, I'm going to make it hard now. Imagine it was me.
[00:12:21.900] 每次见到这个人，哪怕只是一小会儿，我都会想起之前发生的事。你会想，天哪，这个人居然出轨了。我想我会想，我得知道接下来发生了什么之类的。这很正常。我觉得这是人之常情。好吧。其实，我现在要给你增加点难度。想象一下，如果是我。
[00:12:49.460] I was like, dude, Jisoo, I like cheated on my partner. Oh God. What do I do? Oh God. Imagine I just drop it in our group chat. You're like, hey guys, guess what Crystal told me. I think I would just be like, you should tell him. And then if you didn't, I would just leave it at that. Honestly.
[00:12:49.460] 我当时就想，Jisoo，我好像背着我男朋友出轨了。天哪。我该怎么办？天哪。想象一下，如果我直接在群聊里说出来，你会怎么想？你会说，嘿，你们猜猜Crystal跟我说了什么？我觉得我会说，你应该告诉他。如果你不说，我也不会再提这件事了。真的。
[00:13:19.020] You're like, Crystal will come around eventually, right? Here's how I come to terms with it in my brain. Yeah. The goal is resolution. Right. So say you guys resolved it and you didn't tell him or like you resolved whatever it was. Then maybe it's okay. I don't know. This makes me sound horrible. But it's like at the end of the day, I'm your friend. And your boyfriend is really great. But you're like my main client, you know?
[00:13:19.020] 你会想，Crystal 最终会想通的，对吧？我是这样慢慢接受这件事的。没错。目标是解决问题。对。假设你们解决了问题，你没告诉他，或者说你们解决了其他什么事。那也许也没什么。我不知道。我这么说听起来很糟糕。但说到底，我是你的朋友。你的男朋友也很好。但你就像我的主要客户，你知道吗？
[00:13:51.670] Oh my God. Okay. No, that's fair. I think like there's only so much you can do. And as you said before, you can't control your friends. You can share your thoughts because they brought, you know, a problem to you. But at the end of the day, yeah, it sounds kind of bad, but it's true.
[00:13:51.670] 我的天哪。好吧。嗯，这很公平。我觉得你能做的也就这么多。就像你之前说的，你控制不了你的朋友。你可以说说你的想法，因为他们给你带来了麻烦。但说到底，是啊，听起来有点糟糕，但这是事实。
[00:14:11.110] Like you're probably going to waste more emotional energy worrying about your friend doing what you would want them to do rather than kind of trusting them to learn through the experience themselves. Because sometimes it's like someone has to go through it to truly understand, you know, what they should or shouldn't do in the future. I totally agree. And I honestly think it changes as we grow older too.
[00:14:11.110] 你可能更愿意把精力放在担心朋友会不会按照你希望的方式去做，而不是相信他们能从自身经历中学习。因为有时候，一个人必须亲身经历才能真正明白，将来应该做什么，不应该做什么。我完全同意。而且说实话，我觉得随着年龄增长，这种想法也会改变。
[00:14:40.930] One is just because you told me that something happened, it doesn't mean you want me to solve all your problems. And it also doesn't mean that I am, I guess, allowed to just like air your dirty laundry out, even if it is to your SO. I might not know if you guys even talked about it and resolved it. Like you don't owe me that information just because you told me what initially happened.
[00:14:40.930] 首先，就算你告诉我发生了什么事，也不代表你想让我帮你解决所有问题。其次，我也没资格把你家的丑事到处宣扬，哪怕是跟你的伴侣说的。我可能根本不知道你们有没有谈过这件事，有没有解决。你没必要因为告诉我事情经过就告诉我这些。
[00:15:04.430] And I think the other thing is as we get older, I think the weight of your friend's advice or like, you know, the weight of your friends in your life gets a little bit lighter and lighter. Like in high school, I think if you were to ask me this, I would be like, yeah, maybe I would tell the other person. But now, I don't know. It's like it's your life. And there's like more complications that you might not know. And if you like brought something up, okay, like low key, what if cheating was like part of someone's relationship?
[00:15:04.430] 我觉得还有一点，随着年龄增长，朋友的建议，或者说朋友在你生活中的影响力，会越来越小。比如高中时，如果你问我这个问题，我可能会说，嗯，也许我会告诉对方。但现在，我不知道了。毕竟这是你自己的生活，而且会有很多你不知道的复杂情况。如果你不经意地提起，比如，如果出轨是对方感情的一部分呢？
[00:15:34.710] Yeah, it could be like an open relationship. Or like your fetish or something. And you just like didn't know because you only know this one piece of the puzzle. And then you're like trying to out them. And then the other person's like, I don't want to hear this. I know it, but I don't need someone to be like tattling on me.
[00:15:34.710] 对，可能就像开放式关系，或者像你的某种癖好之类的。你只是不知道而已，因为你只了解冰山一角。然后你想方设法揭穿他们。结果对方却说：“我不想听这些。我知道，但我不需要别人告我的状。”
[00:15:54.090] I think there's like it's such a careful balance of like meddling in someone's life and trying to like enact maybe your own sense of righteousness versus like trying to be a helpful friend in a situation. I think that's the perfect way to put it. Like I don't feel like there's a right answer to this. It's so ambiguous, I think, what you're supposed to do. And it's also ambiguous what being a good friend would look like in this situation. Yeah.
[00:15:54.090] 我觉得这其中存在一个微妙的平衡：既要避免干涉别人的生活，试图维护自己的正义感，又要努力做一个乐于助人的朋友。我觉得这么说很贴切。我觉得这个问题没有标准答案。我觉得这很模糊，你不知道自己应该怎么做。而且，在这种情况下，做一个好朋友应该是什么样子，也很模糊。是的。
[00:16:22.810] Because on one hand, you could push for your friend to live an honest life or whatever you think is right in your head. But also the consequences of that, that's also a cross that you have to bear if you throw yourself in the situation. So I don't know. And I think it's also completely fair if like, you know, a friend told you that they're cheating on people. And then that kind of changes your perception of them. So you like distance yourself from them. Yeah.
[00:16:22.810] 一方面，你可以劝朋友诚实生活，或者做任何你认为正确的事情。但另一方面，如果你让自己陷入这种境地，你也必须承担相应的后果。所以，我不知道。而且，如果朋友告诉你他们出轨了，我觉得这完全合情合理。这自然会改变你对他们的看法，所以你会疏远他们。是的。
[00:16:51.530] Sometimes that's like the best solution even. That is true. Do you think I'm like almost scared to ask this, but for you, we're obviously close. But you and James also have your own friendship as well. You guys know each other from like high school too. So what do you think you would do? Oh God. Who's telling me? I want to hear what you would do for both situations. Oh my God. Okay. Wait, this is tough. Okay.
[00:16:51.530] 有时候，这甚至是最好的解决办法。确实如此。你觉得我问这个问题是不是有点害怕？我们关系很亲密，但你和詹姆斯之间也有友谊。你们好像从高中就认识了。所以，你觉得你会怎么做？天哪。谁来告诉我？我想听听你对这两种情况的应对策略。我的天哪。好吧。等等，这有点难。好吧。
[00:17:20.190] Knowing both of you, I feel like cheating is something that you would both want to know. So I think I would just really ask a lot of questions. Whoever came to me, I'd be like, uh, first question. Uh, what? What? How did this happen? Right. What is the situation? Why did it happen?
[00:17:20.190] 了解你们俩的人都知道，我觉得出轨这种事，你们俩肯定都想知道。所以我想我会问很多问题。不管是谁来问我，我都会先问：“呃，什么？什么？这怎么发生的？对，到底是怎么回事？为什么会发生这种事？”
[00:17:47.930] I would probably try to get all of the details and see like what is going on here because I just, I know the other person would want to know. Right. I guess once I get more details, I'll be like, uh, I don't know, man. I don't know either. I just, I also like can't imagine it. You guys just wouldn't, you know?
[00:17:47.930] 我可能会想方设法了解所有细节，看看到底发生了什么，因为我知道对方肯定也想知道。对吧。我想一旦我掌握了更多细节，我就会说，呃，我也不知道。我也不知道。我简直无法想象。你们肯定也想象不出来，对吧？
[00:18:15.110] So I'm thinking like if it happened, it must've been some like crazy, like story, crazy accident or, you know, something of that sort. Maybe you guys should get therapy. You're like, this is above my pay grade. Like, have you considered couples therapy? Do you think you would have to do the ultimatum of if you don't tell this person, I will?
[00:18:15.110] 所以我在想，如果真发生了，那肯定是个很离奇的故事，比如一场离奇的意外，或者诸如此类的事情。也许你们俩应该去看心理医生。你会说，这事儿我管不了。比如，你们有没有考虑过夫妻咨询？你们是不是得用“如果你不告诉这个人，我就告诉她”这种最后通牒？
[00:18:43.390] I think I would say something like take your time, but if it starts becoming like a really long time and the other person is just like not knowing of any of this, it might start to feel a bit wrong because the hurt will only be worse further down the line.
[00:18:43.390] 我想我会说类似“慢慢来”之类的话，但如果时间过得很慢，而对方却对此一无所知，那可能会感觉有点不对劲，因为这样下去只会让伤害越来越大。
[00:19:07.370] They'll be like, oh, like this happened and you kept me, like I feel so stupid for walking around for a year not knowing, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I'm like now imagining just us at like a friend group gathering or something and then you trying to see if the other person knows yet. Like, so what do you guys all think of cheating? Anything crazy happened lately? Oh my God. Oh my God.
[00:19:07.370] 他们会说，哦，好像发生了这种事，你却瞒着我，我感觉自己像个傻瓜，一年都不知道，你知道吗？是啊，是啊。哥们儿，我现在脑补的画面是，我们俩在朋友聚会什么的，然后你试探对方知不知道。比如，你们怎么看待出轨？最近发生什么疯狂的事了吗？我的天哪，我的天哪。
[00:19:37.770] Please don't. Please don't ever put me in that situation. You look so stressed out from the hypothetical. I'm like, guys, can you please never cheat on each other? Let's ban cheating. Okay, let me ask something more lighthearted. Okay, thank God. And more friendship related. I think this is also something that happens somewhat often, but let's say you meet your friend's other best friend.
[00:19:37.770] 拜托别这样。千万别让我陷入那种境地。光是想想就觉得压力好大。我就想说，哥们儿，能不能别互相出轨啊？咱们就禁止出轨吧。好吧，那我问个轻松点的。谢天谢地。再说点儿跟友情有关的。我觉得这种情况也挺常见的，比如说，你遇到了你朋友的另一个好朋友。
[00:20:05.150] You see them interact and you're like, damn, they seem really close to each other in a way that's maybe similar in some ways, different in other ways to your friendship with this friend. How would you feel? And do you think you would do something or act differently at all? Is this friend A, you know, your initial friend? Are they my best friend too? Yeah. Let's say they're like a top three friend. Myspace top three.
[00:20:05.150] 你看到他们互动，就会想，天哪，他们看起来关系真好，某种程度上跟你和这位朋友的友谊相似，又有些不同。你会作何感想？你觉得你会做些什么或者采取不同的行动吗？这位朋友A是你最初的朋友吗？也是我最好的朋友吗？嗯，假设他是你最要好的三个朋友之一，MySpace上的前三名。
[00:20:35.070] And then friend B is their top three friend too. Yes, yes. Dang. Okay, this is tough. I think it's inevitable to kind of compare a little bit and be like, damn, like they know a lot. But I think it also depends on how friend A acts. Are they now just attached to the hip with friend B leaving you out?
[00:20:35.070] 然后朋友B也是他们关系最好的三个朋友之一。是啊，是啊。哎。好吧，这确实有点难。我觉得难免会有点比较，然后心想，天哪，他们知道的真多。但我觉得这也取决于朋友A的行为。他们现在是不是和朋友B形影不离，把你排除在外了？
[00:21:05.010] Or are they like being really inclusive and everyone is involved? You know, even though there's these differences and potential comparisons, you're still all hanging out, having a good time. That's actually a really interesting way to put it. I wouldn't think first about friend A's behavior, but you're totally right. There are times where it's not awkward at all because the middle person handles it really well. But other times it can feel a little bit like you watch one friendship and then you watch another friendship and then your friendship is live.
[00:21:05.010] 或者他们其实很包容，每个人都参与其中？你知道，即使存在这些差异和潜在的比较，大家仍然在一起玩得很开心。这确实是一个很有意思的说法。我一开始不会想到朋友A的行为，但你说得完全对。有时候完全不会尴尬，因为中间人处理得很好。但有时候，感觉就像你先看了一段友谊，然后又看了另一段友谊，最后才发现自己的友谊也变成了这样。
[00:21:34.490] You know, it's like flipping through the channels. Yeah. Okay, I guess that means that also friend B's behavior as well as your own behavior matters here too. Are you vying for friend A's attention too hard? Or is friend B coming on to friend A too hard, leaving you feeling left out? Do you think there's like a foolproof strategy?
[00:21:34.490] 你知道，这就像换台一样。嗯。好吧，我想这意味着朋友B的行为以及你自己的行为也很重要。你是不是太想引起朋友A的注意了？或者朋友B对朋友A的追求太过火，让你感觉被冷落了？你觉得有什么万无一失的策略吗？
[00:21:59.550] Is there something that you can do in this situation to kind of beat out the other vibes and like set the tone? I think just trying your best to probably assume good intent and act unbothered if you feel like someone is being like, I don't know, territorial or something. Yeah, yeah. And then I think if you show unbotheredness and emotional maturity in this situation, then
[00:21:59.550] 在这种情况下，有没有什么办法可以消除其他负面情绪，营造一种氛围呢？我觉得你可以尽量假设对方是出于好意，如果感觉对方有点……嗯，像是在宣示主权之类的，就表现得毫不在意。对，对。我觉得如果你在这种情况下表现出毫不在意和情绪成熟，那么……
[00:22:28.910] the only person really getting bothered is the other person, right? Friend B. Yeah. It's not a competition if there's only one person in the competition. Yeah. How would you handle it? Dude, this is, I think, hard for me. This is something that I personally struggle with. I don't know how to do the like juggling. This stuff doesn't come naturally, I think, to me. Yeah. So I think I would just feel jealous. Wait, it's okay.
[00:22:28.910] 真正感到困扰的只有对方，对吧？朋友B：是啊。如果只有一个人参赛，那就不算比赛了。没错。你会怎么处理？兄弟，我觉得这对我来说很难。这是我个人一直很苦恼的事情。我不知道该怎么同时处理这么多事情。我觉得这些对我来说不是与生俱来的。是啊。所以我想我只会感到嫉妒。等等，没关系。
[00:22:57.710] I think I felt that way too. But then like I had to literally self-reflect and like come to terms. That's just how things are, you know? Right. Like people just have other friends too. Okay. I will say it's a lot easier now that I'm not 19. Wait, yeah, that's true. Or like even younger. Yeah. I feel like this happened more in like high school, maybe even college. Yeah.
[00:22:57.710] 我觉得我以前也有过这种感觉。但后来我不得不认真反思，接受现实。事情就是这样，你知道吗？对。就像每个人都有其他朋友一样。好吧。我得说，现在我已经不是19岁了，情况好多了。等等，是啊，没错。或者更小的时候。是啊。我觉得这种事在高中，甚至大学的时候更容易发生。是啊。
[00:23:24.350] Maybe part of it is just as you grow older and people go to different colleges, for example, or have their own set of friends for like different niche parts of their life, you accept that everyone has all these other circles. And it's just becomes a part of life. But I think when I was younger, it was like truly hard for me to understand. And I think I was very territorial. Oh. If I think back. I feel like that's very understandable.
[00:23:24.350] 也许部分原因是，随着年龄增长，人们会去不同的大学，或者在人生的不同阶段拥有各自的朋友圈，你会逐渐接受每个人都有自己的社交圈子。这自然而然地成为生活的一部分。但我觉得年轻的时候，我真的很难理解这一点。而且我当时领地意识很强。哦，现在想想，这其实很容易理解。
[00:23:51.090] I think I've definitely had moments of jealousy with friends as well. Like, damn, what the fuck? I thought I was your best friend. Yeah. There's such a big emphasis on like best friendship, especially in middle school, I think is when best friends really mattered. Yeah. There would be people that like you're known to hang out with. And then it's like kind of a big deal if they're hanging out with someone new, I guess. Yeah.
[00:23:51.090] 我觉得我肯定也跟朋友有过嫉妒的时候。比如，天哪，搞什么鬼？我以为我是你最好的朋友呢。是啊。现在特别强调“最好的朋友”，尤其是在中学，我觉得那时候最好的朋友真的很重要。是啊。你会遇到一些你经常一起玩的朋友。然后如果他们跟别人一起玩，就好像是件大事一样。是啊。
[00:24:19.110] And I feel like that especially happened in the beginning of like the school year when you get a new class schedule, you get different seat mates or whatever. And then when you watch your best friend hit it off with someone else, you're like, that was me last year. Remember during math? Yeah.
[00:24:19.110] 我觉得这种情况尤其容易发生在学年伊始，比如拿到新的课表，换了新的座位什么的。然后当你看到你最好的朋友和别人相处融洽时，你就会想，去年我也是这样。还记得上数学课的时候吗？嗯。
[00:24:37.350] I think another perspective of this, though, that I feel like I was able to feel more when I got older was seeing like people be close and thinking, oh, that's so nice that this person was able to find a really good friend that they share such and such together with. Yeah, very true.
[00:24:37.350] 不过，我觉得随着年龄增长，我更能体会到另一种角度：看到人们关系亲密，我会想，哦，真好，这个人能找到一个真正的好朋友，一起分享这么多事情。是啊，确实如此。
[00:25:02.170] Maybe this feels more relevant now that we're going to bachelorettes and, you know, more weddings and stuff. One of the best feelings is when you go to a bachelorette and then you see your close friends, other close friends, and you're like, wait, we like vibe so well. Like we're all very different, but the vibe is so good. Like the energy is so high. And you can start to sort of fit the puzzle pieces together of your friend's life. Yeah. Like when this person's not with me, she's with this person and they have such a great time in this way.
[00:25:02.170] 或许现在参加单身派对、婚礼之类的活动，感觉这更有意义了。最棒的感觉之一就是参加单身派对，见到你的好朋友，其他好朋友，然后你会想，等等，我们相处得真好。虽然我们性格各异，但气氛却特别棒。能量爆棚。你开始慢慢了解朋友的生活，就像拼图一样把她们的点点滴滴拼凑起来。没错。比如，当这个人不和我在一起的时候，她和那个人在一起，他们玩得那么开心。
[00:25:30.370] But in that sense, I think seeing the differences in your friendship feels like a celebration. Oh, I must fill this niche while this person fills this other niche. For sure. And I think it also is validating in a sense because you're like, oh, yeah, I vibe with their other friends. Obviously, that means, you know, we're all similar and like it checks out that these people are her friends too. Yeah. It would probably be weird if like you met someone, someone's other friends and like you all hated each other.
[00:25:30.370] 但从这个意义上讲，我觉得看到友谊中的差异就像是一种庆祝。哦，我必须填补这个空缺，而这个人则填补了另一个空缺。当然了。而且我觉得这在某种程度上也是一种肯定，因为你会想，哦，是的，我和他们的其他朋友很合得来。显然，这意味着，你知道，我们都很相似，而且这些人也是她的朋友，这很合理。是啊。如果你遇到某人的其他朋友，结果你们彼此都讨厌对方，那可能就很奇怪了。
[00:26:02.270] True. That would be horrendous vibes. You'd probably be like, wait, what? Like does this person have different personalities? Why are all the friends so different? Yeah, I guess that would be a different situation to navigate in itself. I don't think I would feel jealous, but I think I would also have different complicated feelings about it as well. Oh my God.
[00:26:02.270] 没错。那感觉肯定糟透了。你可能会想，等等，什么？这个人有多重人格吗？为什么所有的朋友都性格迥异？是啊，我觉得这本身就是一种需要应对的情况。我应该不会嫉妒，但肯定也会有其他很复杂的情绪。我的天哪。
[00:26:23.230] Then speaking of this, what if your friend, friend A, had another friend, friend B, that you thought was not a good friend to friend A? Oh. Oh. Maybe you feel like they treat them poorly or maybe they have like certain behaviors that you feel are unfair to friend A or maybe there's like some toxicity there or something like that. Do you think you would do anything about it? Oh, God. This one is truly like what can you even do, you know?
[00:26:23.230] 说到这个，如果你的朋友A有个朋友B，而你觉得B对A不太好呢？哦，哦。也许你觉得B对A不好，或者B的一些行为让你觉得对A不公平，又或者B和A之间存在某种不友好的关系之类的。你会做些什么吗？哦，天哪。这种情况真的让人很纠结，到底能怎么办呢？
[00:26:53.470] I might bring it up in a subtle way if possible. I mean, as subtle as you can honestly be, but I might bring it up and be like, oh, it's kind of funny that this person does this. Have you ever noticed that? And like see if that's something that they had felt. But if they were like, oh, I didn't notice or like that doesn't really bother me. I think I would just drop it and be like, OK, well, clearly this is something that's OK for them, like not a deal breaker. So what more can I do? That's fair.
[00:26:53.470] 如果可以的话，我会尽量委婉地提起这件事。我的意思是，尽可能委婉，比如我会说：“哦，这个人这样做还挺有意思的。你有没有注意到？”然后看看他们是不是也有这种感觉。但如果他们说：“哦，我没注意到”或者“这对我来说没什么大不了的”，我想我就会就此打住，说：“好吧，显然这对他们来说没什么问题，不是什么大不了的事。那我还能做什么呢？”这样也算公平。
[00:27:23.230] Especially if they're like, that's just how they are. Like they're unbothered about it. Because friendships are complicated. Yeah, they are. What would you do? I've actually done this before in a relationship where I thought like a friend was not being a great friend. I didn't really say anything because I felt like the friendship was still good. And there were qualities that were still really great.
[00:27:23.230] 尤其是当他们表现得好像“我就是这样”的时候，好像他们对此毫不在意。因为友谊很复杂。是啊，确实很复杂。你会怎么做？我以前也遇到过这种情况，当时我觉得一个朋友做得不够好。但我没说什么，因为我觉得这段友谊还不错。而且，他们之间确实有很多很棒的品质。
[00:27:47.530] But I think at a certain point, I felt like this one quality was causing stress. So I like brought it up a little bit as gently as I could. OK, so basically the situation was like this friend B didn't really ever reciprocate in, for example, like coming to friend A to hang out. Even though friend B had the means to like a car or like that kind of stuff. Yeah.
[00:27:47.530] 但我觉得到了某个阶段，我感觉这个特质让我很焦虑。所以我尽量委婉地跟她提了一下。好吧，事情大概是这样的：朋友B从来没有像其他朋友那样积极地回应朋友A的邀请，比如来朋友A家玩。即使朋友B有能力，比如有车之类的。是的。
[00:28:16.130] But friend A had to like jump through hoops to get to friend B and they would constantly be doing that. And so it was like sometimes a little stressful, like planning it and stuff. So then I think I just like brought it up gently. Like, oh, what if you like what if you ask friend B to come here? You know, to come to you. I don't remember if anything came of it, but I was like, well, that's the best I can do. You're like, that's that.
[00:28:16.130] 但是朋友A要费很大劲才能见到朋友B，而且他们总是这样。所以有时候挺让人头疼的，比如要计划见面什么的。然后我就委婉地提了一下。比如，要不你邀请朋友B过来？你知道，让她来找你。我不记得最后有没有成行，但我当时就想，好吧，这是我能想到的最好办法了。然后我就想，就这样吧。
[00:28:43.770] I almost feel like it's easier to bring it up in a relationship because I don't know, in some ways your SO's friends directly affect your life as well. Mm hmm. So then I feel like there's a little bit more grounds that you might have. Right. And it's also your beloved person, mental health or time or just like a lot of things that actually end up impacting you too. Yeah.
[00:28:43.770] 我觉得在恋爱关系中更容易提起这件事，因为，在某种程度上，伴侣的朋友也会直接影响你的生活。嗯。所以我觉得你在恋爱关系中更有底气。对。而且，这关系到你爱的人，比如心理健康、时间等等，很多事情最终都会影响到你。是的。
[00:29:06.650] But with a friend, I feel like it's a little bit, you know, like uncharted territory or like something that's a little bit more rough to navigate. That's true. Yeah, I guess like unless your friend A is complaining to you and like asking for a solution, there's not much you can really do except maybe offer a suggestion or like a piece of advice. Yeah. That they are free to either ignore or accept.
[00:29:06.650] 但和朋友相处，我觉得有点像是在探索未知领域，或者说，感觉有点棘手。确实如此。是啊，除非你的朋友A向你抱怨，寻求解决方案，否则你除了提些建议或忠告之外，也做不了什么。嗯，他们可以自由选择接受或忽略。
[00:29:34.990] I think even that situation is sometimes funny too. Like when a friend is ranting about their friend and say it's someone that you also saw these red flags from a mile away, there's always the hesitation of do I go in on this person? Or should I just be like, oh, like maybe you should talk to them. Maybe you guys should try to sort it out. Or you're like, dude, I knew it. Yeah.
[00:29:34.990] 我觉得这种情况有时候也挺搞笑的。比如朋友抱怨自己的朋友，说你早就看出这个人有很多问题，这时你总会犹豫要不要跟他/她理论？还是应该说，哦，或许你应该跟他/她谈谈，你们应该试着解决问题？或者你会想，兄弟，我就知道！
[00:30:03.050] It's like how far do you open the floodgates? It's kind of like that thing where people say when people just break up, you don't want to like go in on their ex because what if they get back together and then you're the friend who like shat on their ex for a month straight or something? Gotta like reel it back a little bit. Keep it light until you know it's permanent. Yeah. Although I think sometimes it could almost be the opposite.
[00:30:03.050] 这就像你要把闸门打开到什么程度？有点像人们常说的，当别人刚分手时，你最好别去攻击他们的前任，万一他们复合了，那你岂不是成了那个连续一个月都在背后说他们前任坏话的朋友？得稍微收敛一点。在确定关系稳定之前，保持轻松的态度。是啊。不过我觉得有时候情况可能恰恰相反。
[00:30:33.590] So let's say you have a friend who you have a bad history with. Like you might not be friends anymore or you might be like acquaintances, but you know some shit has gone down between you and this person a long time ago. But what if you see your really close friend, friend A again, I guess? Yeah. Become close friends with this person you have beef with. Ooh. Friend beef or beef? Oh, yeah.
[00:30:33.590] 假设你有个朋友，你们之间有过一段不太愉快的往事。比如你们可能已经不再是朋友了，或者只是点头之交，但你知道很久以前你们之间发生过一些不愉快的事情。但是，如果你再次遇到你非常要好的朋友A呢？没错。你会不会和这个曾经有过节的人重新成为好朋友？哦，是朋友之间的矛盾还是真正的矛盾？哦，对。
[00:31:03.450] Friend beef. Okay. Friend beef. Friend beef. Okay.
[00:31:03.450] 朋友牛肉。好的。朋友牛肉。朋友牛肉。好的。
[00:31:33.350] I think this really depends. Three, four years ago. Would you bring it up to your friend? Hmm. That is tough. Uh, okay. Let me think. But it's not too serious, right? Like the beef? Yeah. Okay. Let's say this person was talking shit about you. Oh. And then you found out, but you thought you guys were super close. Damn. That's kind of serious. Damn. Okay.
[00:31:33.350] 我觉得这真的要看情况。三四年前，你会跟朋友提起这件事吗？嗯……这有点难。呃，好吧。让我想想。但应该不算太严重吧？比如说，像那种小摩擦？嗯。好吧。假设这个人一直在背后说你坏话。哦。然后你发现了，但你一直以为你们关系特别好。糟了。这可就有点严重了。糟了。好吧。
[00:32:02.340] Actually, this is really tough. And friend A is like, oh my God, I just met this person and they're awesome, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you used to be friends with this person, right? Okay. If it's early enough, maybe I would just be like, oh, yeah, they were cool, but like, they were mean to me. Uh. But if you want to be friends with them, it's chill.
[00:32:02.340] 其实这真的很难。朋友A会说：“天哪，我刚认识这个人，他/她超棒的，对吧？” 是啊，对啊。哦，你以前和这个人是朋友，对吧？好吧。如果时间还早，我可能就会说：“哦，是啊，他/她人挺好的，但是，他/她对我挺刻薄的。” 嗯。但如果你想和他/她做朋友，那就没问题。
[00:32:27.960] I guess also there's an element of like, I think I should trust friend A. If friend B started talking shit about me to friend A, friend A would probably be like, wait, what? Like, this seems unreasonable or this shit that you're talking maybe isn't, it's like overblown or whatever. But then if friend A just like goes along with friend B, then maybe friend A wasn't that great of a friend to begin with. Oh, interesting.
[00:32:27.960] 我觉得还有点儿，就是，我觉得我应该信任朋友A。如果朋友B开始在朋友A面前说我的坏话，朋友A可能会想，等等，什么？比如，这听起来不太合理，或者你说的这些话可能根本就不是真的，有点夸张之类的。但如果朋友A就这么附和朋友B，那可能朋友A一开始就不是个好朋友。哦，有意思。
[00:32:56.360] You're kind of like, what will happen will happen. And then after a bit of time, you can see like where the loyalties lie, I guess. Yeah. I think that's like ideal, right? But what actually happens is not always the ideal situation. True, true, true. So like, you know, maybe I'm more compelled to be like, oh, yeah, like this person's chill, but like they're kind of mean to me. So I don't know. And then, you know, maybe just leave it at that. Some subtle nudge. Yeah.
[00:32:56.360] 你会觉得，顺其自然吧。过一段时间，你就能看出谁更忠诚，我想。是啊。我觉得这才是理想的状态，对吧？但实际情况并不总是那么理想。没错，没错，没错。所以，你知道，我可能更倾向于觉得，哦，这个人挺随和的，但对我有点刻薄。所以我也不知道。然后，你知道，也许就到此为止吧。稍微暗示一下。嗯。
[00:33:25.100] So if your friend was like, wait, really? Like, that's crazy. What happened? Do you tell them the full thing? I think I would tell them a simplified version. I would just be like, oh, I don't know. I guess we disagreed on something. And then like they started talking shit about me to all their friends. Something like that. Oh, OK. Dude, I think you're a nicer person than I am because I would definitely be like, dude, you should watch out. Like this shit went down between us. And I was like super hurt by it. OK, actually, that's true.
[00:33:25.100] 所以如果你的朋友突然说：“等等，真的吗？这也太离谱了吧。到底发生了什么？”你会把事情的全盘托出吗？我觉得我会简单概括一下。我会说：“哦，我也不知道。好像我们之间有什么分歧。然后他们就开始跟所有朋友说我的坏话。大概就是这样。”然后他们会说：“哦，好吧。哥们儿，我觉得你比我好多了，因为我肯定会说：‘哥们儿，你可得小心点儿。’我们之间发生了这种事。我当时真的很难过。好吧，其实，确实如此。”
[00:33:54.820] Like depends on how hurt I was probably. Like if it's something I can get over now, I'd probably just like say it lightly and like maybe mention it. But if it was something that actually affected me a lot, I would probably be closer to what you said. Similar. It feels so much more real thinking about the beef being just like a couple of years ago, you know, and not like high school drama. I guess the other factor, too, is how close friend A and friend beef seem. True. Because I do think there's like a sweet spot.
[00:33:54.820] 这可能取决于我当时有多受伤。如果这件事我现在已经释怀了，我可能只会轻描淡写地提一提。但如果这件事真的对我影响很大，我可能就会像你说的那么做。确实如此。想到这件事发生在几年前，而不是像高中时期的闹剧，感觉就真实多了。我觉得另一个因素是朋友A和朋友之间的矛盾看起来有多亲密。没错。因为我觉得这其中确实存在一个微妙的平衡点。
[00:34:23.360] If they're already really close, there's not really a point of bringing it up unless I'm asked about it or unless something happens between them and then they come to me. Then I might be compelled to be like, oh, my God, maybe this is like a pattern. This happened to me as well. But if they're like already bestie status, posting stuff together all the time, like always hanging out, then is there a point of even bringing it up? True.
[00:34:23.360] 如果他们关系已经很亲密了，除非他们主动问起，或者他们之间发生了什么事，他们才来找我，否则我没必要主动提起这件事。那样的话，我可能会忍不住想，天哪，这会不会是一种模式？我也遇到过这种情况。但如果他们已经是闺蜜了，经常一起发动态，形影不离，那还有什么必要提起这件事呢？确实如此。
[00:34:50.200] Because maybe that person just beefed with you, but like they're not bringing it into their friendship with friend A. That's like totally fine then, I feel like. It was just you and friend B buttheads, but they're not making it into everything. Maybe they were just incompatible with you, but they're like a super good friend to friend A. Then I wouldn't want to deprive friend A of that just because I have scars from this person. Yeah, that's true.
[00:34:50.200] 因为也许那个人只是跟你闹过矛盾，但他们并没有把这件事带到和朋友A的友谊中。我觉得这样完全没问题。可能只是你和朋友B有点小摩擦，但他们并没有把这件事闹得沸沸扬扬。也许他们只是跟你性格不合，但他们却是朋友A的超级好朋友。那我可不想因为自己跟这个人有过节就剥夺朋友A的这种友谊。嗯，确实如此。
[00:35:18.230] But you'd be like, don't bring friend B around too much. Oh, dude, that's such a good point. Damn. No, yeah. That would be a problem. Yeah. Would you play nice if friend B got invited to a group hang? Dude, I don't even know. I think it would depend on my mood at the time and also the size of the group.
[00:35:18.230] 但你可能会想，别老带B朋友来。哦，兄弟，你说得太对了。哎。是啊，那确实是个问题。是啊。如果B朋友被邀请参加聚会，你会友好相处吗？兄弟，我也不知道。我觉得这取决于我当时的心情，也取决于聚会的人数。
[00:35:43.750] Because if it's like a big thing, there's like 15, 20 people, then do I even have to do anything other than like say hi? But if it was like an intimate group, say like, I think even up to like eight people, it's pretty intimate. I would probably put on my best poker face. Oh my God. Or would you just be like, oh, sorry, I can't make it. Ooh. Ooh. I think it would be a coin toss. Okay. Thoughts on this.
[00:35:43.750] 因为如果是那种大型聚会，比如15、20人，那我除了打个招呼什么都不用做吗？但如果是那种小型聚会，比如说，我觉得就算只有八个人，也挺私密的。我可能会装出一副扑克脸。我的天哪。或者你会直接说，哦，抱歉，我去不了。哦。哦。我觉得这得看运气了。好吧。你们怎么看？
[00:36:12.570] Friend B comes to friend A's birthday party. So you have to be there. Yeah. And, you know, like you and friend B are not good. But friend B is like playing super nice with you. Oh, God. I think I would match the vibes. Like, oh my God. Have you been? You have to, right? Yeah. Yeah. But would you feel like it's fake, do you think? Or would you be like, oh, maybe the beef is in the past?
[00:36:12.570] 朋友B来参加朋友A的生日派对，所以你也得去。是啊。而且，你知道，你和朋友B关系不太好。但朋友B却对你特别友好。我的天哪。我觉得我跟他们相处起来会很合拍。真的，我的天哪。你去过吗？你肯定去过，对吧？是啊。是啊。但你会不会觉得这很假？还是你会觉得，哦，也许过去的矛盾已经过去了？
[00:36:42.670] Oh. I think for me, if we didn't talk through it, it's not in the past. Ooh, okay. It's going to be just ongoing slash dormant or whatever if we didn't address it and then get closure from the situation. So if friend B came up to me and did the whole like, oh my God, have you been? Like, it's been so long. And then we like talked through it afterwards. I would definitely be like, bitch.
[00:36:42.670] 哦。我觉得对我来说，如果我们不好好谈谈，这件事就不能算是过去了。哦，好吧。如果我们不去解决它，不给这件事一个交代，它就会一直存在，或者一直处于停滞状态，或者别的什么状态。所以如果朋友B突然跑来跟我说：“我的天哪，你最近怎么样？好久不见了。”然后我们之后才好好聊了聊。我肯定会说：“你个混蛋。”
[00:37:19.800] I'm dying. I don't know. Maybe I'm just petty. What would you do? It would depend on how friend B acted throughout the night. Because sometimes you can see through a fake facade. Right. And if it's like more genuine. But I think in the moment I would play nice too, probably. Yeah. Because like, what else can you do? Yeah. It's one of those things where there's no point starting drama.
[00:37:19.800] 我快崩溃了。我不知道。也许我只是太小气了。你会怎么做？这要看B朋友昨晚的表现。因为有时候你能看穿虚伪的面具。对。如果她更真诚的话。但我想当时我可能也会表现得友好一些。是啊。因为还能怎么办呢？是啊。这种事没必要挑起事端。
[00:37:48.950] But at the same time, I can't help how I feel. For you, if you felt like there wasn't a facade, they were actually being super friendly, would you find it within you to like forgive them? Or how would your emotions play out through the night? Ooh. I guess maybe in my mind I'd be like, oh, maybe our beef was like not a big deal. I guess I like forgot about it. And I'd be like, okay, I guess maybe I'll try to think that way too.
[00:37:48.950] 但与此同时，我控制不住自己的感受。对你来说，如果你觉得他们没有伪装，而是真的非常友好，你会原谅他们吗？或者你的情绪会在夜里如何波动？哦。我想我可能会想，哦，也许我们之间的矛盾根本没什么大不了的。我想我已经忘了这件事了。然后我会想，好吧，也许我也应该试着这样想。
[00:38:16.510] And then see how it goes. But you're right. I think it would be a little weird if like, you know, maybe you start back this friendship up. But they like never mention the beef in the past. Right. And like you two don't hash it out and say sorry to each other. It might be a little weird to like build that friendship off of unresolved matters. Out of the ashes of your old friendship. Yeah.
[00:38:16.510] 然后看看情况再说。不过你说得对。我觉得如果你们重新开始这段友谊，会有点奇怪。但你们以前从来不提以前的矛盾。对吧？你们俩也不好好谈谈，互相道歉。如果这段友谊建立在未解决的问题之上，就像是从旧友谊的灰烬中重新开始一样，可能会有点怪异。是啊。
[00:38:42.310] I feel like if say, you know, during this birthday party, you were in the bathroom or something in line for the bathroom and then friend B comes up and like joins you in the line and then it's like, hey, by the way, like I just wanted to say I know in the past we've had our differences, but you know, that's all in the past. Then I'd be like, oh, okay. Like I feel like that's probably a pretty good restarting point.
[00:38:42.310] 我觉得，比如说，在生日聚会上，你正在洗手间排队，然后朋友B走过来加入你的队伍，接着你说：“嘿，对了，我想说，我知道我们以前有过一些分歧，但你知道，那些都过去了。” 那我就会说：“哦，好的。” 我觉得这大概是一个很好的重新开始的契机。
[00:39:07.230] It sounds so simple when we talk about it because truly I think all it takes sometimes is for one person to just be like, look, that was really shitty. I am not happy with how we ended things or I really miss you or just say something mildly emotional to address everything that went down in the past. And then I feel like within 30 seconds, you can both kind of move on from it and either restart something or at least not end on bad terms.
[00:39:07.230] 说起来好像很简单，因为我觉得有时候只需要一个人说一句：“哎呀，那真的太糟糕了。我对我们分手的方式很不满意。”或者“我真的很想你。”或者说些稍微带点感情的话，把过去发生的一切说出来。我觉得，只要30秒，你们俩就能放下这件事，重新开始，或者至少不会闹得不愉快。
[00:39:36.670] But I think it would take a lot out of me. I think it would take a lot of courage. Oh, for sure. And a lot of bathroom pep talk for me to do that. So I guess it's just one of those things that sounds simple, but it's not. I completely agree because I think on friend B's side, if like say friend B needed to apologize, it can be scary. Yeah. You're like, oh, what if I like apologize, but then it like upsets them more. Right. Or just brings up the past.
[00:39:36.670] 但我认为这会让我精疲力竭。我觉得这需要很大的勇气。哦，当然。而且我得在洗手间里给自己打气好多次才能做到。所以我觉得这就像那种听起来很简单，但做起来却并非如此的事情。我完全同意，因为我觉得站在朋友B的角度来看，如果比如说朋友B需要道歉，那确实会很可怕。是啊。你会想，哦，如果我道歉了，结果反而让他们更难过怎么办？没错。或者只是勾起过去的回忆。
[00:40:06.030] Yeah, I know. I think I would think a million things. Am I the only one who felt like this was a big deal and this person is clearly over it? Is it even worth mentioning or what if I bring it up and they start crying? Or there's so many different ways the situation could go. But honestly, I think most people in that situation would be able to just be like, yeah, it's fine and just resolve it then and there. The ideal versus the actual.
[00:40:06.030] 是啊，我知道。我想我会想很多事。难道只有我一个人觉得这件事很严重，而这个人显然已经释怀了吗？这件事还有意义吗？万一我提起，他们会不会哭？或者说，事情可能会有各种各样的发展方向。但说实话，我觉得大多数人遇到这种情况都会说，嗯，没事了，然后就当场解决了。理想和现实之间还是有差距的。
[00:40:33.450] Okay, but what if let's continue the storyline with friend B and friend A. Let's say, you know, you and friend B, you got that B. And then friend B tells something to friend A about like a situation that happened before where you and friend B were both there. And then friend A is like, oh my God, dude, like I just got I just heard this crazy story,
[00:40:33.450] 好吧，如果我们继续讲这个故事，换成朋友B和朋友A呢？假设，你和朋友B，你知道，就是那个B。然后朋友B跟朋友A讲了一件之前你们俩都在场的事。然后朋友A就说，我的天哪，哥们儿，我刚听到一个超疯狂的故事……
[00:41:01.390] like this juicy gossip, like let me share with you. And they start telling you the story. And you're like, wait, where did you hear that? That's like wrong. Ooh, this is what actually happened. Oh, wait. So it's me and friend B telling friend A different stories, right? Yes. So like, what would I do? Yeah, you're hearing that like friend A is getting, I don't know, maybe like skewed info
[00:41:01.390] 就像那种劲爆的八卦，让我跟你分享一下。然后他们就开始讲故事。你就会想，等等，你是从哪儿听说的？这不对劲。哦，原来是这样。哦，等等。所以是我和朋友B跟朋友A讲了不同的版本，对吧？对。那我该怎么办？是啊，你听到的好像是朋友A得到了，我不知道，也许是被歪曲的信息了。
[00:41:28.110] or like not quite what you thought was true. Yeah, dude. Honestly, I think I would put my well, I already am beefing with this person anyway. So fuck it. I would be like, that's so cap. Also, I just have to say, since like four scenarios ago, I have like actual faces and locations in my head. Oh my God. Like friend A has a face. We're at like J-Soo's place. Okay.
[00:41:28.110] 或者说，跟你想的完全不一样。是啊，兄弟。说实话，我觉得我会说，反正我已经跟这个人有过节了，所以管他呢。我会说，这都是胡扯。还有，我得说，大概从四个场景之前开始，我的脑子里就出现了具体的脸和地点。我的天哪。比如朋友A的脸。我们好像在J-Soo家。好吧。
[00:41:58.070] The birthday party is at J-Soo's place. But yeah, dude, I think I would put my foot down and be like, well, this is what I remember or like I was there and this is what I feel like happened. But I guess that is one of those things where my perception of something is truly just my perception. I might be projecting or I might be misremembering stuff. So there's only so much you could push the issue. But I think I would say something to friend A and be like, I don't know if everything you
[00:41:58.070] 生日派对是在J-Soo家。不过，兄弟，我觉得我会坚持己见，说，嗯，这是我的记忆，或者说我当时就在现场，这是我感觉发生的事情。但我想，这种事，我的感知真的只是我的感知。我可能在投射，或者我可能记错了。所以，你能坚持的也就这么多。但我认为我会跟朋友A说，比如，我不知道你说的那些是不是真的……
[00:42:27.290] heard is completely accurate. Okay. Yeah. I guess there's nothing else really except just sharing your side. Although I will say it puts friend A in a really interesting spot because I don't know if two of your closest friends came to you about a situation and the stories were really different, what would you do? Hmm. As friend A, I suppose I would, I guess I would just try to like pick out whatever pieces
[00:42:27.290] 听到的完全属实。好吧。是的。我想除了分享你的说法之外，也没什么别的可说了。不过，这确实让朋友A处境很有意思，因为我不知道，如果你的两个最亲密的朋友都跟你谈起同一件事，而他们的说法却截然不同，你会怎么做？嗯。作为朋友A，我想我会……我想我会试着把所有线索都找出来。
[00:42:57.390] sounded the most reasonable, most plausible even. Or I guess sometimes it could just be like different perspectives that they're sharing. So then it's like, oh, okay, I guess like this person was just like really hurt in this situation. So they felt like this is what happened and that person was unbothered. So this is what they like saw slash felt. Yeah. True. Yeah. I guess I would just be like, wow, cool. I have so many perspectives of the story.
[00:42:57.390] 听起来最合理，甚至最可信。或者我想有时候可能只是他们分享了不同的视角。比如，哦，好吧，我猜这个人当时真的受到了很大的伤害。所以他们觉得事情就是这样发生的，而另一个人却毫不在意。所以这就是他们所看到/感受到的。是的。没错。是的。我想我会想，哇，真酷。我对这个故事有这么多不同的理解。
[00:43:26.610] You got like a 360 view of something that happened. But like if they told me to choose sides, then I'd be like, wait, I never, I never agreed to this. Oh, interesting. Yeah. I guess that is also complicated because sometimes you do have to sort of serve as a neutral party between two people that may not hate each other, but are not neutral or positive to each other.
[00:43:26.610] 你对发生的事情有了全方位的了解。但如果他们让我选边站队，我就会想，等等，我从来没同意过。哦，有意思。是啊。我觉得这也挺复杂的，因为有时候你必须在两个可能并不互相憎恨，但彼此之间也并非中立或友好的人之间扮演中立的角色。
[00:43:51.670] What are some ways you think you try to stay super neutral when something like this happens? I think I try to keep all the differing parties separated. Like I will not bring them together. Yeah. What if your friend comes to you and starts talking shit about your other close friend? How do you tow that balance between being a supportive ear to your friend who is ranting
[00:43:51.670] 当遇到这种情况时，你觉得你会用哪些方法来保持绝对中立？我觉得我会尽量把各方分开，不让他们接触。是啊，如果你的朋友来找你，开始说你另一个好朋友的坏话呢？你该如何平衡倾听和支持，既能安抚正在抱怨的朋友，又能保持中立呢？
[00:44:18.070] to you, but also not involving yourself or having that person feel validated in their shit talking of your other close friend? Hmm. Hmm. This is tough, dude. I don't know. I think I would try to like defend the other friend in some ways. If, you know, let's call them friend C or friend R, friend ranter. Okay. Okay. So friend R is like shitting on, I don't know, friend A or something.
[00:44:18.070] 对你来说，既要避免卷入其中，又要避免让那个人觉得他们诋毁你另一个好朋友的行为有道理？嗯……嗯……这可真难办，兄弟。我也不知道。我想我会试着在某些方面维护一下那个朋友。比如说，我们姑且叫他朋友C或者朋友R，那个爱抱怨的朋友。好吧，好吧。假设朋友R在诋毁，比如说，朋友A之类的。
[00:44:47.650] I'd probably be like, oh, but like I know friend A and like they probably wouldn't do this with this and that without reason or like, you know, have you ever, you know, maybe this is what was going on or blah, blah, blah. But I think like if they're just like really going in on it on friend A, I'd probably be like, dude, you can't talk to me about this stuff. I'm close to friend A. Like what do you expect me to do here? Yeah, that's true. There is a certain line that you can't cross.
[00:44:47.650] 我可能会说，哦，但我认识A朋友，他们应该不会无缘无故地做这种事，或者，你知道，你有没有想过，也许事情是这样的，等等等等。但我觉得如果他们真的就A朋友的事大做文章，我可能会说，兄弟，你不能跟我说这些。我和A朋友关系很好，你希望我怎么做？是啊，没错。有些底线是不能逾越的。
[00:45:15.790] You can only be supportive of so much without feeling like you're in enemy territory or something. And I'd probably be like, wait, how is friend R my friend if they're like shitting on my other friend so hard? True. And they should know that I'm close with this person if they're my friend. So like why are they shitting on them? So I think I would start to reevaluate why is this person my, like how did this happen?
[00:45:15.790] 你只能支持一部分人，否则就会感觉像是在敌营里一样。我可能会想，等等，如果朋友R这么狠地贬低我的另一个朋友，那他怎么还能是我的朋友呢？确实如此。如果他们是我的朋友，他们应该知道我和这个人关系很亲密。所以他们为什么要贬低这个人呢？所以我想我会开始重新审视这个人为什么会是我的朋友，这到底是怎么发生的？
[00:45:43.730] That's a good point because it's like ranting about your own emotions is one thing, but also, I mean, one, know your audience and also two, you don't want to put your friend in a bad spot, which they clearly are doing because you're kind of a bad friend either way or like you will feel like you're being a bad friend no matter what direction you go. Yeah. So I think that's totally valid. Something that I feel like could work is if you talked about the action that was happening,
[00:45:43.730] 你说得很有道理，因为倾诉自己的情绪是一回事，但同时，我的意思是，第一，你要了解你的听众；第二，你不想让你的朋友难堪，而他们显然正在让你难堪，因为你无论如何都算不上一个好朋友，或者无论你怎么做，你都会觉得自己是个坏朋友。是的。所以我认为这完全合理。我觉得一个可能有效的方法是，如果你谈谈正在发生的事情，
[00:46:13.170] but not on like the character attacks, because I think it's fair to be like, oh, I don't know why this person did this. That kind of sucked. And I can see how you could take it a certain way, but you don't have to join in or agree when they're like, oh, this person's insert whatever name calling here or like character attacks of, oh, I feel like this person is doing this because they're a shitty friend and blah, blah. Like that is where I would draw the line. Yeah. I think in some occasions it's okay to be like, yeah, I think it's shitty that this person
[00:46:13.170] 但像人身攻击这种事就另当别论了，因为我觉得可以坦诚地说：“哦，我不知道这个人为什么这么做。这确实很糟糕。”我能理解你可能会有某种解读，但你没必要参与或认同他们那种“哦，这个人……”之类的辱骂或人身攻击，比如“哦，我觉得这个人这么做是因为他是个糟糕的朋友”等等。这就是我的底线。是的。我觉得在某些情况下，我们可以说：“是啊，我觉得这个人这么做很糟糕。”
[00:46:41.150] did this action and I'm sorry that it affected you in this way. Yeah. That's a good middle ground. You're like, yeah, that was shitty of them to do, but that's where we end the conversation. But I will go no further than that. Before we wrap up the episode, I want to talk about a less serious topic and a more funny, lighthearted one.
[00:46:41.150] 我做了这件事，我很抱歉它对你造成了这样的影响。嗯，这算是一个不错的折中方案。你会想，是啊，他们这么做确实很糟糕，但我们的谈话就到此为止吧。但我不会再深入讨论了。在结束这期节目之前，我想聊一个轻松有趣的话题。
[00:47:05.430] I always feel like it's really fun slash funny to hang out with my friend and their SO. And then I always feel like their child when I do that. True. How do you feel about those kinds of situations? Well, I totally agree. But other times I feel like their mom. I don't know how to just, I honestly think it depends like whose house you're at. Oh, okay.
[00:47:05.430] 我觉得跟朋友和他们的伴侣一起玩特别开心，也特别逗。但有时候我又觉得自己像他们的孩子。确实。你对这种情况有什么感觉？嗯，我完全同意。但有时候我又觉得自己像他们的妈妈。我也不知道该怎么形容，说实话，我觉得这得看你去的是谁家。哦，好吧。
[00:47:33.810] And then also if you're going somewhere, who's driving? Sometimes I'll feel like the kid if say we're at their house or like they're the ones driving. Yeah. But if they're at my house or I'm the one driving, I'm like, get in kids. We're like, welcome in kids. Wait, I feel like it adds to the vibe too sometimes because if you're going out with like a couple, they'll be like, oh, like we got you.
[00:47:33.810] 还有，如果你们要去某个地方，谁开车？有时候，比如说我们在他们家，或者他们开车的时候，我会感觉自己像个孩子。是啊。但如果他们在我家，或者我开车，我就会说：“孩子们，快上车！”我们会说：“欢迎孩子们上车！”等等，我觉得这有时候也能增添气氛，因为如果你和一对情侣出去，他们会说：“哦，我们罩着你呢。”
[00:48:02.470] And then I'm like, mom, dad. Wait, do you ever feel like the entertainment? Oh. Like when you hang out with a couple? Sometimes I'm like, I feel like the court jester or something. Putting on a show for my fans. Oh my God. Wait, I never thought about that. Maybe a little bit. They're like, oh, so what, you know, new fun things do you have to share? Because I see this guy every day. Right.
[00:48:02.470] 然后我就跟爸妈说：“等等，你们有没有觉得自己像个娱乐明星？” 哦，就像跟情侣们一起玩的时候？有时候我觉得自己像个小丑什么的，在给粉丝们表演。我的天哪，等等，我从来没想过这个问题。也许有那么一点点吧。他们会说：“哦，所以呢，你知道，你有什么新鲜有趣的事情可以分享吗？因为我每天都能看到你。” 对。
[00:48:29.250] Or say you're going out with your friend and their SO. How do you guys sit at like a restaurant or a bar or something? Oh, I think they sit next to each other and I sit facing them. Okay. Then that's truly court jester dinner and a show kind of vibe. Because usually I think I sit across from the person I'm closer to. But I also feel the most like a kid when it's like they're driving and, you know,
[00:48:29.250] 或者说，你和朋友以及他们的伴侣一起出去玩。你们在餐厅或酒吧之类的地方怎么坐？哦，我想他们会并排坐着，我坐在他们对面。好吧。那感觉就像是宫廷小丑晚宴和表演一样。因为通常我会坐在关系更亲近的人对面。但当他们开车的时候，我感觉自己最像个孩子，你知道的……
[00:48:56.950] they're up in the front two seats and I'm just in the back seat by myself. You start playing like the raindrop game, you know, on the window. I think it's also interesting situations because there's like a couple of couples that this happens with a lot where like I'll meet up with them or I'll hang out with them and it's like just them two and me and I'm like their child. And they're also a little older than us.
[00:48:56.950] 他们坐在前排两个座位上，我一个人坐在后排。然后我们就开始玩“雨滴游戏”，你知道，就是对着窗户玩。我觉得这种情况挺有意思的，因为经常有几对夫妇这样，我跟他们见面或者一起出去玩，就只有他们俩和我，我感觉自己像他们的孩子。而且他们年纪也比我们大一些。
[00:49:26.270] So I think that adds to it. Have you ever experienced, you're used to third wheeling this friend at their SO and then they like have a new SO and you hang out with them for the first time. Do you ever feel like it's weird or different vibes? Ooh. Okay. I think this happened like one time. And because of how the breakup went down, I was unbothered. I was like, oh yeah, that breakup was justified. This new guy? Great.
[00:49:26.270] 所以我觉得这也加剧了这种感觉。你有没有过这样的经历：你以前经常当电灯泡陪朋友的伴侣出去玩，然后他们有了新伴侣，你第一次和他们一起出去玩。你会不会觉得气氛有点怪怪的？哦，好吧。我想这种情况发生过一次。因为他们分手的方式，我当时并不在意。我就想，哦，对，那次分手是情有可原的。这个新男友？太好了。
[00:49:58.170] But yeah, I guess a lot of the couples that I hang out with, sometimes as like one with two people, they're like long-term couples. They're like 10 plus years. So I'd be pretty shocked if they broke up, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I guess this was maybe more of an occurrence when we were younger. But I just remember my friend got a new SO and we were hanging out and I just had this moment of like, whoa, it used to be a different man on the passenger seat.
[00:49:58.170] 是啊，我认识的很多情侣，有时候两个人一起玩，都是那种交往很久的，至少十年以上了。所以如果他们分手，我觉得会很惊讶。嗯，是啊。我觉得这种事在我们年轻的时候可能比较常见。我记得我朋友有了新男友，我们一起出去玩的时候，我突然意识到，哇，以前坐在副驾驶座上的是另一个人。
[00:50:29.310] Oh my God. Okay. Yeah. Are you then a child of divorce? Well, I think it's also interesting to see your friend interact with different people in their lives and see how like the relationship can be so vastly different. I think each relationship brings out a different aspect of someone. So then observing that front row seats to that is kind of crazy.
[00:50:29.310] 我的天哪。好吧。是的。那你是离异家庭的孩子吗？嗯，我觉得观察你的朋友与生活中不同的人互动，以及他们之间的关系可以多么截然不同，也很有意思。我认为每段关系都会展现出一个人不同的方面。所以，近距离观察这一切，感觉真的挺奇妙的。
[00:50:53.930] Well, when you hang out with someone, if it's you and James and then one person hang out with you, do you feel like they're parents? Kind of. But at the same time, I think a lot of our friends are like equally our friends. So then it feels more just like us back in college or something. Oh, I see. You know what I mean? Yeah. We revert back to our youth. Wait. Oh my God. You know, the funniest thing is.
[00:50:53.930] 嗯，当你和别人一起玩的时候，比如你和詹姆斯，然后另一个人也来和你们一起玩，你会觉得他像父母一样吗？有点像。但同时，我觉得我们很多朋友也和我们一样是朋友。所以感觉更像是回到了大学时代。哦，我明白了。你懂我的意思吗？嗯。我们又回到了年轻的时候。等等。我的天哪。你知道吗，最搞笑的是……
[00:51:19.650] So one of my friends who is in a long-term relationship and I often hang out with them as like just me. So I always joke with them like, oh my God, mom and dad. And then one time they posted on Instagram and like three other people commented mom and dad. And I was like, that's crazy. I thought I was an only child. It was your one chance. I only child this.
[00:51:19.650] 我有个朋友，他有稳定的伴侣，我经常单独跟他出去玩。我总是跟他开玩笑说：“天哪，爸爸妈妈！” 有一次他在Instagram上发帖，结果有三个人评论说“爸爸妈妈”。我当时就想，这也太疯狂了吧。我一直以为自己是独生子女呢。这可是你唯一的机会啊！我可是独生子女啊！
[00:51:49.890] I was like, hold up. I think I even texted her. I was like, dude, how many people are your kid? Huh? How many mom and dad roles do you play? Did you feel like you were getting cheated on? Dude, this is a callback to that jealousy question. I was actually very like shocked initially. I was like, oh my God, other people have the audacity to comment mom and dad.
[00:51:49.890] 我当时就懵了，等等。我好像还给她发了短信。我说，老兄，你到底有几个孩子？哈？你扮演过多少个爸爸妈妈的角色？你有没有觉得被背叛了？老兄，这跟之前那个关于嫉妒的问题有点关系。我当时真的非常震惊。我心想，我的天哪，居然有人敢评论“爸爸妈妈”这种事。
[00:52:20.030] And then I was like, you know what? That's just how they are. It's I'm sure it's natural that many people are like, oh my God, mom and dad. That's so funny. Did you start like stalking their profiles? Like I'm a better kid than you are. No, but I was just like, damn, that's crazy. Dude, that's like the perfect way to summarize friendship sometimes. Like something happens and you're just like, that's crazy. So you move on with your life.
[00:52:20.030] 然后我就想，你知道吗？他们就是这样。我相信很多人都会觉得，天哪，爸妈。这也太搞笑了。你是不是开始偷偷关注他们的账号了？好像我比你懂事似的。没有，但我当时就觉得，我去，这也太疯狂了。哥们，有时候这简直就是友谊的完美写照。就像发生了一些事，你会觉得，这也太疯狂了。然后你就继续过你的生活。
[00:52:48.090] Also, so this couple has a dog and when they first adopted the dog, I was like, oh my God, my sibling. So I was like, dude, like are other people this dog's sibling? Like that is so funny. I'm sure you're their most favorite kid. I hope so. Well, we talked through a ton of hypotheticals today, both serious and silly.
[00:52:48.090] 还有，这对夫妇养了条狗，他们刚领养那条狗的时候，我就想，我的天哪，这不就是我的兄弟姐妹吗？我就说，哥们儿，其他人是不是也跟这条狗是兄弟姐妹啊？这也太搞笑了。我肯定你是他们最喜欢的孩子。希望如此。嗯，我们今天讨论了很多假设性的问题，既有严肃的，也有搞笑的。
