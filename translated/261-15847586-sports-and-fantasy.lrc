[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_04]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo
[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_04]：嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo
[00:00:03.680] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jimin and I'm James
[00:00:03.680] [SPEAKER_02]：我是Jimin，我是James
[00:00:16.140] [SPEAKER_05]: So today we have on one familiar voice and one new voice
[00:00:16.140] [SPEAKER_05]：所以今天我们有一个熟悉的声音和一个新的声音。
[00:00:21.900] [SPEAKER_05]: You might recognize James from some prior episodes
[00:00:21.900] [SPEAKER_05]：你可能在之前的几期节目中见过詹姆斯。
[00:00:25.080] [SPEAKER_05]: And he is actually also my husband
[00:00:25.080] [SPEAKER_05]：而且他也是我的丈夫
[00:00:27.300] [SPEAKER_05]: And we also have on Jimin today
[00:00:27.300] [SPEAKER_05]：今天我们还有关于Jimin的话题。
[00:00:29.740] [SPEAKER_05]: Who is Chrisals boyfriend
[00:00:29.740] [SPEAKER_05]：克里斯尔的男朋友是谁？
[00:00:33.210] [SPEAKER_05]: So we have on these two guests to talk about sports
[00:00:33.210] [SPEAKER_05]：我们请来了这两位嘉宾来谈谈体育。
[00:00:37.940] [SPEAKER_05]: And we're gonna be diving into how we like to watch sports, athletes we like etc
[00:00:37.940] [SPEAKER_05]：接下来我们将深入探讨我们喜欢如何观看体育比赛，我们喜欢的运动员等等。
[00:00:44.340] [SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually pretty topical since we are a couple weeks deep into fantasy football right now
[00:00:44.340] [SPEAKER_05]：这其实挺应景的，因为我们现在已经进入梦幻橄榄球赛季两周了。
[00:00:50.540] [SPEAKER_04]: Lovely sport
[00:00:50.540] [SPEAKER_04]：精彩的运动
[00:00:53.660] [SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off by talking about fantasy
[00:00:53.660] [SPEAKER_04]：那么，我们先来谈谈奇幻吧。
[00:00:57.540] [SPEAKER_04]: This is Jeesoo and I is first year doing fantasy football with all the guys in our friend group
[00:00:57.540] [SPEAKER_04]：我是Jeesoo，今年是我第一次和我们朋友圈里的男生一起玩梦幻足球。
[00:01:04.540] [SPEAKER_04]: And it's quite the experience
[00:01:04.540] [SPEAKER_04]：这真是一次难忘的经历。
[00:01:06.800] [SPEAKER_05]: Wait, it's like significantly more stressful than I thought it would be
[00:01:06.800] [SPEAKER_05]：等等，这比我想象的要紧张得多。
[00:01:10.680] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm like worried every day and I feel like I don't have the knowledge to know what to look for
[00:01:10.680] [SPEAKER_05]：我每天都很担心，感觉自己缺乏相关知识，不知道该注意些什么。
[00:01:15.460] [SPEAKER_05]: Like look into
[00:01:15.460] [SPEAKER_05]：比如看看
[00:01:16.320] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just anxious with no like solution
[00:01:16.320] [SPEAKER_05]：所以我很焦虑，却找不到解决办法。
[00:01:18.980] [SPEAKER_04]: Wait yeah, I played fantasy basketball and football is not the same
[00:01:18.980] [SPEAKER_04]：等等，是的，我玩过梦幻篮球，但橄榄球不一样。
[00:01:24.440] [SPEAKER_04]: It is so different and usually I'm like
[00:01:24.440] [SPEAKER_04]：这太不一样了，通常我都是这样的
[00:01:27.540] [SPEAKER_04]: Kind of good at fantasy basketball
[00:01:27.540] [SPEAKER_04]：我玩梦幻篮球还不错
[00:01:30.260] [SPEAKER_04]: But like football dude, it's rough
[00:01:30.260] [SPEAKER_04]：但就像足球一样，这很艰难。
[00:01:32.420] [SPEAKER_05]: I will say the punishment aspect is also a little bit scary
[00:01:32.420] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得惩罚方面也有点吓人。
[00:01:36.480] [SPEAKER_05]: So and our league the loser
[00:01:36.480] [SPEAKER_05]：所以，我们联赛输了。
[00:01:38.360] [SPEAKER_05]: Both of the week and of the total league has to do a punishment
[00:01:38.360] [SPEAKER_05]：本周和整个联赛都必须受到处罚。
[00:01:43.220] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty scary
[00:01:43.220] [SPEAKER_05]：所以这挺吓人的。
[00:01:45.460] [SPEAKER_04]: Our punishment is to take an ice at the end of the week
[00:01:45.460] [SPEAKER_04]：我们的惩罚是周末吃冰块。
[00:01:48.640] [SPEAKER_04]: If you scored the least points out of the whole league and
[00:01:48.640] [SPEAKER_04]：如果你是整个联赛中得分最低的，
[00:01:51.980] [SPEAKER_04]: I just bought a six pack of icees at this point
[00:01:51.980] [SPEAKER_04]：我刚买了一箱六罐装的冰沙
[00:01:56.120] [SPEAKER_05]: So James and Jim in what is it like for you guys to watch me and Chris all play because you guys have played fantasy football in the past right
[00:01:56.120] [SPEAKER_05]：詹姆斯和吉姆，你们看我和克里斯一起打球是什么感觉？因为你们以前也玩过梦幻橄榄球，对吧？
[00:02:03.120] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of funny seeing
[00:02:03.120] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，看到这个还挺搞笑的。
[00:02:04.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Beginners fall into like the same pitfalls we've run into in the beginning with like choosing based on what the stats they or like
[00:02:04.880] [SPEAKER_02]：新手很容易陷入我们一开始就遇到的那些陷阱，比如根据他们喜欢的统计数据来选择。
[00:02:12.720] [SPEAKER_02]: Watching you guys get updated with like news and just freaking out with news. It's kind of funny
[00:02:12.720] [SPEAKER_02]：看着你们听到新闻就大惊小怪，还挺搞笑的。
[00:02:17.740] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say like overreaction is extremely prevalent
[00:02:17.740] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得过度反应现象非常普遍。
[00:02:22.220] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think exercising patience is important for
[00:02:22.220] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，我认为培养耐心很重要。
[00:02:25.600] [SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy football. I think like watching Chris little play fancy basketball
[00:02:25.600] [SPEAKER_01]：梦幻足球。我觉得就像看克里斯·利特尔打花式篮球一样。
[00:02:28.640] [SPEAKER_01]: She's very very good at that but sometimes they're different aspects to fantasy football where it's kind of like
[00:02:28.640] [SPEAKER_01]：她在这方面非常非常出色，但有时候这和梦幻足球的某些方面有所不同，有点像……
[00:02:34.820] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like oh my god why is this happening? Like don't worry. It's okay. It's okay
[00:02:34.820] [SPEAKER_01]：你会想，天哪，为什么会这样？别担心，没事的，没事的。
[00:02:37.760] [SPEAKER_01]: Like it'll be fine and then she's depressed for the entire weekend
[00:02:37.760] [SPEAKER_01]：好像一切都会好起来，结果她整个周末都闷闷不乐的。
[00:02:41.840] [SPEAKER_05]: There's been many a text exchange between we and Chris so we were just lamenting about our team
[00:02:41.840] [SPEAKER_05]：我们和克里斯之间有很多短信交流，所以我们只是在抱怨我们的团队。
[00:02:48.100] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's so different too because football is just the weekend
[00:02:48.100] [SPEAKER_04]：兄弟，这差别也太大了，因为足球比赛只在周末举行。
[00:02:51.320] [SPEAKER_04]: Like Thursday Sunday Monday and then basketball is like every day
[00:02:51.320] [SPEAKER_04]：比如周四、周日、周一，然后篮球比赛几乎每天都有。
[00:02:55.140] [SPEAKER_04]: So it's easier to like make moves and more stats happen but football is like one and done
[00:02:55.140] [SPEAKER_04]：所以更容易做出动作，也更容易产生更多数据，但足球就像一场比赛就结束了。
[00:03:01.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, football is definitely more like a buildup
[00:03:01.500] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，足球比赛确实更像是一场酝酿。
[00:03:04.020] [SPEAKER_02]: You're building up towards just one part of that week, but then I feel like basketball is like a slow burn
[00:03:04.020] [SPEAKER_02]：你只是在为那一周的某个阶段做准备，但我觉得篮球就像一场慢热的燃烧。
[00:03:08.500] [SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's 82 games so
[00:03:08.500] [SPEAKER_02]：我的意思是，总共有82场比赛，所以
[00:03:10.420] [SPEAKER_02]: It almost feels like it matters less
[00:03:10.420] [SPEAKER_02]：感觉好像没那么重要了。
[00:03:12.340] [SPEAKER_02]: But for football. It's like oh the weekend is
[00:03:12.340] [SPEAKER_02]：但对于足球来说，就像是，哦，周末是
[00:03:15.260] [SPEAKER_02]: Extremely crucial yeah fantasy football is the first step to gambling. I think
[00:03:15.260] [SPEAKER_02]：没错，梦幻足球极其重要，它是赌博的第一步。我认为
[00:03:20.240] [SPEAKER_04]: That's true. Oh, yeah, I think football feels way more gambling than like basketball
[00:03:20.240] [SPEAKER_04]：没错。哦，是的，我觉得足球比篮球更像是赌博。
[00:03:25.220] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because the stats almost don't matter
[00:03:25.220] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，因为统计数据几乎无关紧要。
[00:03:27.940] [SPEAKER_05]: It's completely random anything could happen so I just think I didn't expect fantasy to be such an emotional experience
[00:03:27.940] [SPEAKER_05]：一切都是随机的，什么事都可能发生，所以我没想到奇幻故事会如此触动我的情感。
[00:03:35.060] [SPEAKER_05]: I knew drafting would be like intense so I was like prepared for that
[00:03:35.060] [SPEAKER_05]：我知道起草工作会很紧张，所以我做好了准备。
[00:03:39.560] [SPEAKER_05]: I felt like the draft one fairly well for me and then afterwards I was like wait what the fuck
[00:03:39.560] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得草稿还不错，但之后我就想，等等，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:03:44.420] [SPEAKER_05]: I actually have to give a shit every few days and like keep track of stats keep track of who's practicing
[00:03:44.420] [SPEAKER_05]：我其实每隔几天就得操心一下，比如记录统计数据，看看谁在练习。
[00:03:50.400] [SPEAKER_05]: Like I did not think I would have to care about that
[00:03:50.400] [SPEAKER_05]：我没想到我竟然要操心这件事。
[00:03:53.800] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude Jesus first injury was brutal. Oh, yeah, those little stuff
[00:03:53.800] [SPEAKER_04]：老兄，耶稣第一次受伤真是太惨了。哦，是啊，那些小事儿。
[00:03:59.340] [SPEAKER_01]: Make you want to watch more football games
[00:03:59.340] [SPEAKER_01]：让你更想看足球比赛
[00:04:02.480] [SPEAKER_01]: Especially the games with the players that you have on your team
[00:04:02.480] [SPEAKER_01]：尤其是和你的队友一起打的比赛。
[00:04:05.720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I did watch a couple of games in the last few weeks and I think watching it
[00:04:05.720] [SPEAKER_05]：所以，过去几周我看了几场比赛，我觉得看比赛……
[00:04:10.600] [SPEAKER_05]: Still like really don't know what's going on because the thing about fantasy football that I didn't know was I thought it would be like very straightforward
[00:04:10.600] [SPEAKER_05]：我还是不太明白发生了什么，因为我之前对梦幻橄榄球的了解仅限于我以为它会非常简单明了。
[00:04:17.760] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this player gets a touchdown you get six points or whatever the kicker made a goal
[00:04:17.760] [SPEAKER_05]：哦，这个球员达阵得分，你们得六分，或者不管怎样，踢球手射门得分了。
[00:04:23.700] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't even know what the play points would be actually
[00:04:23.700] [SPEAKER_05]：好吧，我甚至不知道实际的得分是多少。
[00:04:26.340] [SPEAKER_05]: But if I realize it's not as straightforward because you have to look at like passes and stuff
[00:04:26.340] [SPEAKER_05]：但如果我意识到事情并没有那么简单，因为你还得考虑传球之类的东西。
[00:04:31.380] [SPEAKER_05]: And half the time I have no idea which number my players are or like who even cut the pass or whatever
[00:04:31.380] [SPEAKER_05]：很多时候我根本不知道我的球员是几号的，也不知道是谁传球的，或者其他什么情况。
[00:04:36.980] [SPEAKER_05]: So honestly when we watch football
[00:04:36.980] [SPEAKER_05]：说实话，我们看足球比赛的时候
[00:04:39.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like staring at it like what's going on and James is like okay, this is good for you
[00:04:39.000] [SPEAKER_05]：我当时就盯着看，心想这是怎么回事，然后詹姆斯说，好吧，这对你有好处。
[00:04:43.060] [SPEAKER_05]: This is bad for you
[00:04:43.060] [SPEAKER_05]：这对你不好。
[00:04:45.120] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I feel like I've been learning so much about football
[00:04:45.120] [SPEAKER_04]：伙计，我觉得我学到了很多关于足球的知识。
[00:04:48.660] [SPEAKER_04]: Drafting and the first week of fantasy. I had a moment where I was like wait
[00:04:48.660] [SPEAKER_04]：选秀和梦幻联赛的第一周。我当时突然意识到……等等
[00:04:53.460] [SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't even know who is on the field like what is the team on the field and like who is playing and what are they doing?
[00:04:53.460] [SPEAKER_04]：我其实根本不知道场上是谁，场上是哪支球队，谁在比赛，他们在做什么？
[00:05:01.500] [SPEAKER_04]: And so I started a deep dive and now I'm like oh, I know football
[00:05:01.500] [SPEAKER_04]：于是我开始深入研究，现在我就想，哦，我懂足球了。
[00:05:05.680] [SPEAKER_05]: I'll get their one
[00:05:05.680] [SPEAKER_05]：我会拿到他们的那一个
[00:05:07.920] [SPEAKER_05]: I think it is kind of an interesting experience though like having my own fantasy team and watching this sport
[00:05:07.920] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得这挺有意思的，就像拥有自己的梦幻球队，然后观看这项运动一样。
[00:05:13.720] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little bit more emotionally invested versus before
[00:05:13.720] [SPEAKER_05]：我现在比以前投入的感情更多了。
[00:05:17.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I just be like oh everyone is doing so great. And I'm like no don't fucking pass it to this
[00:05:17.000] [SPEAKER_05]：我就觉得，哦，大家都表现得真棒。然后我就想，不，别他妈的把球传给这个人。
[00:05:22.620] [SPEAKER_05]: Pass it to my god. That's true
[00:05:22.620] [SPEAKER_05]：把它交给我的上帝。这是真的。
[00:05:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel like fantasy almost ruins the experience of a game
[00:05:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]：我感觉奇幻元素几乎毁掉了游戏体验。
[00:05:28.800] [SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like your micro managing each person or each team and you're like you're doing well
[00:05:28.800] [SPEAKER_02]：因为这就像你在微观管理每个人或每个团队，然后你觉得自己做得很好。
[00:05:33.860] [SPEAKER_02]: But like not in the right places
[00:05:33.860] [SPEAKER_02]：但好像不在合适的地方。
[00:05:37.140] [SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're managing multiple teams and say you have like players playing against each other then you're just like
[00:05:37.140] [SPEAKER_01]：或者如果你管理多个团队，比如说你有类似的球员互相比赛，那么你就相当于……
[00:05:42.140] [SPEAKER_01]: This is not enjoyable for me on either play
[00:05:42.140] [SPEAKER_01]：无论哪种玩法，我都觉得不好玩。
[00:05:44.620] [SPEAKER_05]: Or it's like if you have players on both teams and it's like their playing
[00:05:44.620] [SPEAKER_05]：或者就像两队都有球员，而且他们正在比赛一样。
[00:05:50.020] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm like like why want my defense to do well
[00:05:50.020] [SPEAKER_05]：是啊，我就想，为什么我希望我的防守做得好呢？
[00:05:52.640] [SPEAKER_05]: But this quarterback on the opposite team also needs to get points
[00:05:52.640] [SPEAKER_05]：但是对方球队的四分卫也需要得分。
[00:05:56.140] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I get emotionally invested to my players. I'm like oh you know what?
[00:05:56.140] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得我对我的球员投入了太多感情。我就想，你知道吗？
[00:06:00.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like rooting for them
[00:06:00.600] [SPEAKER_04]：我简直太支持他们了。
[00:06:01.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I believe in them like even if they were shitty like they're on my team like I'll believe in them
[00:06:01.600] [SPEAKER_04]：我相信他们，就算他们很糟糕，但他们毕竟是我的队友，我还是会相信他们。
[00:06:06.640] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I get attached to them and then sometimes when people propose trades
[00:06:06.640] [SPEAKER_04]：然后我就对他们产生了感情，有时当人们提出交易时……
[00:06:10.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like they have so much potential
[00:06:10.600] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得他们很有潜力。
[00:06:13.060] [SPEAKER_04]: How can I just let them go like that? How can I give up on them like that?
[00:06:13.060] [SPEAKER_04]：我怎么能就这样放他们走？我怎么能就这样放弃他们？
[00:06:18.020] [SPEAKER_05]: Even though you didn't draft your team cuties. You still feel that way
[00:06:18.020] [SPEAKER_05]：即使你没有选拔你心目中的可爱队友，你仍然会有这种感觉。
[00:06:21.760] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you have to believe in your team
[00:06:21.760] [SPEAKER_04]：是的，你必须相信你的团队
[00:06:24.520] [SPEAKER_04]: I think true. So speaking of drafting team cuties. Do you all have a specific strategy for drafting?
[00:06:24.520] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得没错。说到选秀，你们有什么具体的选秀策略吗？
[00:06:32.100] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when I draft I literally pull up a couple charts and then just go based off of like what other people are picking
[00:06:32.100] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我选秀的时候，基本上就是随便翻翻图表，然后根据其他人选的牌来决定。
[00:06:38.940] [SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like I don't follow the league close enough in the off season to understand
[00:06:38.940] [SPEAKER_02]：因为我觉得我在休赛期对联盟的关注不够，所以无法理解。
[00:06:44.960] [SPEAKER_02]: What each move is affecting each player so yeah, I just pick based on stats and then like prey
[00:06:44.960] [SPEAKER_02]：每一步操作都会对每个玩家产生影响，所以，是的，我只是根据统计数据来选择，然后就像猎物一样。
[00:06:49.900] [SPEAKER_02]: But then like usually in the middle I'll start to deviate from my plan and just randomly pick people
[00:06:49.900] [SPEAKER_02]：但通常到了中间，我就会开始偏离计划，随机挑选人。
[00:06:53.940] [SPEAKER_02]: And so I can always see the point in my draft when I was like okay, I'm just gonna start drafting
[00:06:53.940] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我总能理解我选秀时的心情，比如，好吧，我这就开始选秀。
[00:06:59.800] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I'm similar to James where you know for like certain
[00:06:59.800] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我觉得我和詹姆斯有点像，你知道，就像……
[00:07:04.280] [SPEAKER_01]: draft engines right they have a sort of a ranking based on average draft position
[00:07:04.280] [SPEAKER_01]：选秀引擎确实会根据平均选秀顺位进行排名。
[00:07:08.780] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of like crowdsourcing how certain players have been drafted
[00:07:08.780] [SPEAKER_01]：所以这有点像通过众包的方式来决定某些球员的选秀结果。
[00:07:12.600] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I tend to go a lot on theory so like theoretically this player should excel
[00:07:12.600] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得我比较注重理论，所以理论上来说，这个球员应该很出色。
[00:07:17.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Based on the personnel or like the offensive scheme whatever but as we all know
[00:07:17.960] [SPEAKER_01]：这取决于人员配置或者进攻策略等等，但我们都知道
[00:07:24.100] [SPEAKER_01]: Theory rarely carries over to real life and so right now I'm being burned by theory quite a bit
[00:07:24.100] [SPEAKER_01]：理论很少能应用于现实生活，所以现在我被理论伤得很深。
[00:07:29.680] [SPEAKER_04]: But fingers crossed that it eventually works out my original straw was to just draft the good looking players
[00:07:29.680] [SPEAKER_04]：但愿最终能成功，我最初的设想只是挑选那些外形出众的球员。
[00:07:37.840] [SPEAKER_02]: It's a good stride would say like most of the good people are good looking
[00:07:37.840] [SPEAKER_02]：这算是一个好兆头，就像大多数好人长得都好看一样。
[00:07:42.120] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a correlation. I think
[00:07:42.120] [SPEAKER_02]：是的，这之间有关联。我认为
[00:07:44.140] [SPEAKER_04]: But sadly my draft pick position did not allow for that
[00:07:44.140] [SPEAKER_04]：但遗憾的是，我的选秀顺位不允许我这样做。
[00:07:48.440] [SPEAKER_04]: So I just drafted kind of yeah similarly like the average position a player gets drafted up
[00:07:48.440] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我只是简单地选秀了一下，嗯，差不多就是球员被选中时的平均位置。
[00:07:54.800] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I feel like the spreadsheets were definitely my base in terms of picking
[00:07:54.800] [SPEAKER_05]：是的，我觉得电子表格绝对是我挑选商品的基础。
[00:07:58.940] [SPEAKER_05]: But the tie breakers are like who's hotter and then also do I have an affiliation with the city?
[00:07:58.940] [SPEAKER_05]：但决胜因素是，谁更性感，以及我是否与这座城市有联系？
[00:08:05.640] [SPEAKER_05]: I picked a lot of Dallas cowboys cuz I'm
[00:08:05.640] [SPEAKER_05]：我选了很多达拉斯牛仔队的球员，因为我
[00:08:09.900] [SPEAKER_05]: Cuz I'm somewhat affiliated with Dallas now
[00:08:09.900] [SPEAKER_05]：因为我现在和达拉斯有点关系。
[00:08:14.140] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I feel that too because in basketball there's like Canadian basketball players
[00:08:14.140] [SPEAKER_04]：好的，我也有这种感觉，因为篮球界也有加拿大篮球运动员。
[00:08:18.020] [SPEAKER_04]: So I like to draft Canadians if they fall to me or whatever
[00:08:18.020] [SPEAKER_04]：所以，如果加拿大人落选，我喜欢征召他们入伍，或者其他什么情况。
[00:08:21.720] [SPEAKER_04]: But in football there's like no Canadian team
[00:08:21.720] [SPEAKER_04]：但在足球领域，几乎没有加拿大球队。
[00:08:24.700] [SPEAKER_04]: There's not that many Canadian players either so I was like these all these names mean nothing to me
[00:08:24.700] [SPEAKER_04]：加拿大球员也不多，所以我就觉得这些名字对我来说毫无意义。
[00:08:29.760] [SPEAKER_04]: I just see a face and like words. Yeah
[00:08:29.760] [SPEAKER_04]：我只看到一张脸和一些文字。是的。
[00:08:33.120] [SPEAKER_05]: Also, I just want to put it out there like all the good looking football players that I was researching before the draft
[00:08:33.120] [SPEAKER_05]：另外，我只是想提一下，就像我在选秀前研究过的所有那些长相英俊的橄榄球运动员一样。
[00:08:38.600] [SPEAKER_05]: ended up all being like defensive people and I was like wait where is Nick Bosa like where are all my linebackers?
[00:08:38.600] [SPEAKER_05]：结果发现所有人都变成了防守队员，我就想，等等，尼克·博萨在哪儿？我的线卫们都去哪儿了？
[00:08:45.620] [SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I draft that?
[00:08:45.620] [SPEAKER_05]：为什么我不能起草？
[00:08:47.460] [SPEAKER_05]: So that was a bit unfair
[00:08:47.460] [SPEAKER_05]：所以这有点不公平。
[00:08:49.560] [SPEAKER_04]: So you mentioned this earlier G-Soo, but I think we also need to talk about the punishment aspect of fantasy
[00:08:49.560] [SPEAKER_04]：G-Soo，你之前也提到过这一点，但我认为我们还需要谈谈幻想中的惩罚方面。
[00:08:55.980] [SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like it is a huge part of the culture and it's pretty insane because
[00:08:55.980] [SPEAKER_04]：因为我觉得这是文化的重要组成部分，而且这很疯狂，因为
[00:09:02.020] [SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy football and pretty sure is like the biggest fantasy sport so a lot of like cultural influence
[00:09:02.020] [SPEAKER_04]：梦幻足球，而且我敢肯定它是最大的梦幻运动，所以它有很大的文化影响力。
[00:09:08.600] [SPEAKER_04]: Originates from football. I think the nature of these like
[00:09:08.600] [SPEAKER_04]：起源于足球。我认为这些的本质就像
[00:09:13.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Punishments and how leagues are formed and just like funny and fun things that people do in their leagues
[00:09:13.900] [SPEAKER_04]：惩罚措施、联赛的组建方式，以及人们在联赛中做的一些有趣的事情。
[00:09:20.560] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can talk about our punishment
[00:09:20.560] [SPEAKER_04]：我想我们可以谈谈我们的惩罚了。
[00:09:24.100] [SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy cuz it's like an iconic punishment and I've never heard about it until I learned more about fantasy football
[00:09:24.100] [SPEAKER_04]：这太疯狂了，因为这简直是一种标志性的惩罚，在我深入了解梦幻橄榄球之前，我从未听说过。
[00:09:30.360] [SPEAKER_02]: The idea we had for our league for the punishment is that the last place person will go to a baseball game with other people in the league
[00:09:30.360] [SPEAKER_02]：我们联盟的惩罚方案是，最后一名要和其他联盟成员一起去看一场棒球比赛。
[00:09:38.140] [SPEAKER_02]: And then they have to eat nine hot dogs and drink nine beers within the nine innings and it's called nine nine
[00:09:38.140] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他们必须在九局内吃掉九根热狗，喝掉九瓶啤酒，这就叫“九九挑战”。
[00:09:44.840] [SPEAKER_05]: Which is terrifying and also our league
[00:09:44.840] [SPEAKER_05]：这太可怕了，而且也是我们联盟的噩梦。
[00:09:46.960] [SPEAKER_05]: It is 10 people before of us our girls. I was like I can see some of the guys completing it
[00:09:46.960] [SPEAKER_05]：我们前面有10个人，都是女生。我当时就想，我能看到有些男生完成了。
[00:09:51.640] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we could do it
[00:09:51.640] [SPEAKER_05]：我不知道我们能不能做到。
[00:09:53.540] [SPEAKER_01]: What's also funny is that baseball has actually tried to speed up the pace of play so you know originally
[00:09:53.540] [SPEAKER_01]：还有一点很有趣的是，棒球实际上曾经试图加快比赛节奏，所以你知道，最初
[00:09:59.780] [SPEAKER_01]: It was you know kind of doable but now you can see games ending in like under two hours
[00:09:59.780] [SPEAKER_01]：以前勉强还能做到，但现在你可以看到有些游戏不到两个小时就结束了。
[00:10:04.740] [SPEAKER_02]: So that sort of adds pressure. Yeah, there's no way the thing is with fantasy football punishments
[00:10:04.740] [SPEAKER_02]：所以这确实增加了压力。是啊，这绝对不是幻想橄榄球惩罚的问题。
[00:10:10.080] [SPEAKER_02]: It's about the intent. I feel like if you tried your best to do it
[00:10:10.080] [SPEAKER_02]：关键在于意图。我觉得如果你尽力去做……
[00:10:14.360] [SPEAKER_02]: It's totally fine. I would say the worst type of people in the world are the people who get last and then
[00:10:14.360] [SPEAKER_02]：完全没问题。我觉得世界上最糟糕的人就是那些总是垫底的人。
[00:10:19.800] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't do the punishment or like do it half-assed
[00:10:19.800] [SPEAKER_02]：别敷衍了事地执行惩罚。
[00:10:23.880] [SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also crucial for the league slash the commissioner who kind of runs the league
[00:10:23.880] [SPEAKER_05]：我认为对于联盟来说，至关重要的是要明确联盟的运作方式，也就是联盟主席的职责。
[00:10:29.860] [SPEAKER_05]: I guess to pick a punishment that's doable and also like somewhat fun and enjoyable while doing it
[00:10:29.860] [SPEAKER_05]：我想应该选择一个既可行又有点乐趣的惩罚方式。
[00:10:36.300] [SPEAKER_05]: Because some of the ones that were proposed in our league. I was like there's no way this is fun or doable
[00:10:36.300] [SPEAKER_05]：因为我们联盟里提出的一些方案，我觉得根本就不好玩，也不可行。
[00:10:42.060] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're some of the alternative punishments that were flooded around there was one that was like you have to
[00:10:42.060] [SPEAKER_01]：嗯，当时有很多替代惩罚措施，其中一种是，你必须……
[00:10:48.850] [SPEAKER_05]: Panhandle on the street be like a street performer almost the only way you could end your punishment was to get
[00:10:48.850] [SPEAKER_05]：在街上乞讨，就像街头艺人一样，你几乎唯一能结束惩罚的方法就是得到……
[00:10:55.290] [SPEAKER_05]: $100 and tips from people
[00:10:55.290] [SPEAKER_05]：100美元和人们给的小费
[00:10:57.630] [SPEAKER_05]: There's also one that was like do like a stand-up comedian set at your local bar or whatever and I was like there's no way
[00:10:57.630] [SPEAKER_05]：还有一条建议是让你在当地酒吧表演脱口秀之类的，我当时就想，这根本不可能。
[00:11:05.230] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to commit to something. I know I would back up
[00:11:05.230] [SPEAKER_05]：我不想做出任何承诺。我知道我会反悔。
[00:11:08.170] [SPEAKER_04]: Did I saw this crazy one on Instagram? It was like go to the airport and you fly to whatever like the cheapest ticket available is and then you can't come home
[00:11:08.170] [SPEAKER_04]：我好像在Instagram上看到过一个很疯狂的帖子？就是去机场，随便买张最便宜的机票飞过去，然后就回不来了。
[00:11:17.790] [SPEAKER_04]: Until you earn your tickets worth oh my god, that's wild. Yeah, I was like that's like what if they're there for like a year
[00:11:17.790] [SPEAKER_04]：直到你赚够了票钱，我的天哪，太疯狂了。是啊，我就想，万一他们在那儿待了一年呢？
[00:11:26.270] [SPEAKER_02]: I think another idea that was proposed which was like quickly shot down was to
[00:11:26.270] [SPEAKER_02]：我认为另一个被提出但很快就被否决的想法是……
[00:11:30.890] [SPEAKER_02]: Fly somewhere and then get home without flying
[00:11:30.890] [SPEAKER_02]：飞到某个地方，然后不用坐飞机就能回家。
[00:11:34.190] [SPEAKER_02]: So we take like buses and stuff all the way home. That's pretty crazy
[00:11:34.190] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我们一路坐公交车之类的回家。这太疯狂了。
[00:11:39.330] [SPEAKER_04]: I think 99 nine nine all though it's like very scary
[00:11:39.330] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得9999虽然很吓人。
[00:11:44.470] [SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun because we can all go to the baseball game together
[00:11:44.470] [SPEAKER_04]：这挺有意思的，因为我们可以一起去看棒球比赛。
[00:11:47.690] [SPEAKER_04]: Right, right there's a group aspect but I do think Jim and had a funny one when he lost two years ago
[00:11:47.690] [SPEAKER_04]：对，对，这其中确实存在团队因素，但我确实觉得吉姆两年前输掉比赛时挺搞笑的。
[00:11:54.130] [SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that
[00:11:54.130] [SPEAKER_01]：谢谢你带来这个
[00:11:56.610] [SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago. I think there was sort of the iconic waffle house or eye-hop challenge the loser had to spend
[00:11:56.610] [SPEAKER_01]：两年前。我记得当时有个很经典的华夫饼屋挑战赛，或者叫“眼球挑战赛”，输的人要花很长时间。
[00:12:03.370] [SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours in one of those fine dining establishments in like the waffle house for instance for every
[00:12:03.370] [SPEAKER_01]：比如在华夫饼屋之类的高级餐厅里待上24小时，每
[00:12:09.370] [SPEAKER_01]: Waffle that was consumed an hour could get taken off of your stay in our league right we
[00:12:09.370] [SPEAKER_01]：你一个小时吃掉的华夫饼可能会从你参加我们联赛的资格中扣除，对吧？
[00:12:14.930] [SPEAKER_01]: Likewise right when the commissioner proposes a punishment we usually
[00:12:14.930] [SPEAKER_01]：同样，当专员提出处罚建议时，我们通常
[00:12:17.990] [SPEAKER_01]: Get the approval of the entire league to make sure everyone's in and so there's usually some adjustments for ours
[00:12:17.990] [SPEAKER_01]：需要获得整个联盟的批准，确保每个人都参与其中，所以我们通常会做一些调整。
[00:12:23.750] [SPEAKER_01]: We just sort of cut it down to 12 hours to make it more reasonable. Oh, wait really it was only 12
[00:12:23.750] [SPEAKER_01]：我们只是把时长缩短到了12小时，这样更合理一些。哦，等等，其实本来就只有12小时。
[00:12:29.390] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we only 12 hours. Yeah
[00:12:29.390] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我们只有12个小时。是啊
[00:12:30.990] [SPEAKER_02]: You try you try sitting in a waffle house for 12 hours how many hours did you sit there and how many waffles did you end up eating so what's actually kind of messed up
[00:12:30.990] [SPEAKER_02]：你试试在华夫饼店里坐12个小时，你坐了几个小时？最后吃了多少个华夫饼？所以，真正有点奇怪的是……
[00:12:39.290] [SPEAKER_01]: There's no waffle houses in California. I had to fly home and do this
[00:12:39.290] [SPEAKER_01]：加州没有华夫饼店。我只好飞回家做这件事。
[00:12:43.970] [SPEAKER_01]: I had a fly back to Texas. I got into the waffle house at about 7 a.m. And I was there until 1.30 p.m
[00:12:43.970] [SPEAKER_01]：我飞回了德克萨斯州。我早上7点左右到了华夫饼店，一直待到下午1点半。
[00:12:50.430] [SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that's what I'm about
[00:12:50.430] [SPEAKER_05]：兄弟，这就是我的风格。
[00:12:52.250] [SPEAKER_01]: The sugar rush. I had six waffles wait is it six plates of waffles or six waffles? Well each waffle is the size of a plate
[00:12:52.250] [SPEAKER_01]：糖分带来的快感。我吃了六个华夫饼，等等，是六盘华夫饼还是六个华夫饼？嗯，每个华夫饼都跟盘子一样大。
[00:13:01.430] [SPEAKER_01]: It was okay. That was all I ate
[00:13:01.430] [SPEAKER_01]：还好。我就吃了这些。
[00:13:05.010] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I had this like immense sugar rush and then crashed afterwards
[00:13:05.010] [SPEAKER_01]：然后我就感觉血糖飙升，之后又骤然下降。
[00:13:10.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Well was nice was like our friends came and visited me
[00:13:10.590] [SPEAKER_01]：感觉真好，就像朋友们来看我一样。
[00:13:14.220] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it was like you know like they had come and and they helped do eat waffles. They didn't count towards the thing
[00:13:14.220] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，就像他们来了，帮忙吃华夫饼。但他们不算数。
[00:13:19.030] [SPEAKER_01]: They would just eat like there's like I'm here for lunch and then it would eat something
[00:13:19.030] [SPEAKER_01]：它们会像在吃午饭一样吃，然后就吃点东西。
[00:13:22.750] [SPEAKER_01]: Like the rest of the food look pretty good, but I actually only eat waffles. Oh, okay. Yeah
[00:13:22.750] [SPEAKER_01]：其他食物看起来都挺不错的，但我其实只吃华夫饼。哦，好的。嗯。
[00:13:27.650] [SPEAKER_01]: I did feel kind of bad because like the waitress was kind of like why are you still
[00:13:27.650] [SPEAKER_01]：我当时确实有点不好意思，因为服务员好像在问我为什么还待在这里。
[00:13:32.310] [SPEAKER_04]: So I had to make sure to tip her very generous as well. You should have put up a sign like I lost my fantasy week
[00:13:32.310] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我必须确保给她非常慷慨的小费。你应该贴个牌子，比如“我的梦幻假期泡汤了”。
[00:13:38.610] [SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, yeah that would have been like helpful sign or something. I mean, yeah
[00:13:38.610] [SPEAKER_01]：说实话，是啊，那本来可以是个很有用的标志之类的。我的意思是，是啊。
[00:13:43.150] [SPEAKER_01]: I found it really hard to explain to her why I was there the whole time
[00:13:43.150] [SPEAKER_01]：我发现很难向她解释我为什么一直待在那里。
[00:13:45.850] [SPEAKER_01]: But she like graciously moved me to like a corner so I wasn't like blocking you know other patrons and stuff
[00:13:45.850] [SPEAKER_01]：但她很客气地把我安排到角落里，这样我就不会挡住其他顾客什么的了。
[00:13:51.450] [SPEAKER_01]: So it was um it was interesting. I would definitely go back just not for 12 hours
[00:13:51.450] [SPEAKER_01]：嗯，挺有意思的。我肯定会再去，只是不会再去12个小时了。
[00:13:57.810] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like six hours not that bad. Yeah, I feel like seven to one is like I don't know
[00:13:57.810] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我觉得六个小时还不错。是啊，我觉得七点到一点就……我不知道。
[00:14:03.510] [SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't sound that bad yeah, watch a couple movies
[00:14:03.510] [SPEAKER_04]：听起来还不错，是啊，看几部电影吧。
[00:14:05.890] [SPEAKER_01]: So there's no internet there. That's the thing right you know like you don't have internet
[00:14:05.890] [SPEAKER_01]：所以那里没有网络。就是这样，你知道，你没有网络。
[00:14:10.030] [SPEAKER_04]: But you have your phone right there's no signal either. Oh no signal. There was like one bar
[00:14:10.030] [SPEAKER_04]：但是你的手机也没信号啊。哦，没信号。之前好像只有一格信号。
[00:14:14.470] [SPEAKER_01]: So actually fun fact that was the day so I played golf too and so Taylor made which is a golf brand and kith
[00:14:14.470] [SPEAKER_01]：其实那天还有个趣事，我也打了高尔夫，穿的是泰勒梅（TaylorMade）——一个高尔夫品牌——的服装。
[00:14:20.770] [SPEAKER_01]: The New York Street brim dropped their first collab and I was extremely mad because I'm sitting in the waffle house
[00:14:20.770] [SPEAKER_01]：纽约街的帽子发布了他们的第一次联名款，我当时气疯了，因为我正坐在华夫饼屋里。
[00:14:26.350] [SPEAKER_01]: With one bar of signal and I could not get anything
[00:14:26.350] [SPEAKER_01]：信号只有一格，我什么都听不到。
[00:14:30.070] [SPEAKER_01]: So my friends had to like proxy it for me, but I was just sitting there like dude nothing's loading like
[00:14:30.070] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我的朋友们只好帮我用代理，但我当时就坐在那儿，心想：老兄，什么都加载不出来。
[00:14:35.150] [SPEAKER_01]: I can't watch anything so that was like the extra layer of torch
[00:14:35.150] [SPEAKER_01]：我什么都看不了，所以这就像是额外的照明工具。
[00:14:39.650] [SPEAKER_01]: But on the plus side the waffle house was a nice neighborhood so it's not like those icon you know
[00:14:39.650] [SPEAKER_01]：但好的一方面是，这家华夫饼屋位于一个不错的街区，所以它不像那些标志性建筑那样。
[00:14:43.670] [SPEAKER_01]: Those like videos you see like those world star
[00:14:43.670] [SPEAKER_01]：那些你看到的视频，就像那些世界明星一样
[00:14:46.150] [SPEAKER_04]: The waffle house scene. So there's a trade off there. Okay, but would you rather sit in like a world star
[00:14:46.150] [SPEAKER_04]：华夫饼屋那段。所以这里面有利有弊。好吧，但你更愿意像世界明星一样坐在那里吗？
[00:14:52.630] [SPEAKER_04]: waffle house with great internet or in a nicer waffle house with no internet
[00:14:52.630] [SPEAKER_04]：一家网络很好的华夫饼店，还是一家环境更好但没有网络的华夫饼店？
[00:14:59.550] [SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I'd probably still take the nice one because I was like I can get some reading done
[00:14:59.550] [SPEAKER_01]：说实话，我可能还是会选那本好的，因为我想我可以读点东西。
[00:15:02.950] [SPEAKER_01]: I was working on this like thermodynamic theory thing for for grad school and so I actually had to like sit down and
[00:15:02.950] [SPEAKER_01]：我当时在读研究生，研究热力学理论，所以我不得不坐下来……
[00:15:08.670] [SPEAKER_01]: derive something and so it worked out
[00:15:08.670] [SPEAKER_01]：从中得出一些结论，所以结果就成功了。
[00:15:10.970] [SPEAKER_01]: I see but like if I didn't probably the world star because I couldn't just like stream it and then people
[00:15:10.970] [SPEAKER_01]：我明白了，但如果我不那样做，我可能就成不了世界明星了，因为我不能直接直播，然后人们……
[00:15:16.170] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I will say I feel like these punishments like the waffle house one nine nine nine or iconic because they're
[00:15:16.170] [SPEAKER_05]：我的意思是，我觉得这些惩罚就像华夫饼屋的1999事件一样，或者说是标志性的，因为它们是
[00:15:23.130] [SPEAKER_05]: So bad like I've also seen some simple or ones
[00:15:23.130] [SPEAKER_05]：太糟糕了，我还见过一些简单的或者类似的。
[00:15:26.190] [SPEAKER_05]: I think I saw like some guy drive in a car and his license plate
[00:15:26.190] [SPEAKER_05]：我好像看到有人开车，他的车牌
[00:15:31.050] [SPEAKER_05]: Border thing just said ice like at fantasy football
[00:15:31.050] [SPEAKER_05]：边境那件事刚才说的是冰，就像梦幻足球里说的那样。
[00:15:33.550] [SPEAKER_05]: I was like that's not a bad punishment at all
[00:15:33.550] [SPEAKER_05]：我当时就想，这惩罚一点也不坏。
[00:15:36.270] [SPEAKER_04]: All right, and then didn't like James your cousin do one was just like had to wear black shoes for the year. Yeah
[00:15:36.270] [SPEAKER_04]：好吧，然后你表弟詹姆斯就因为某件事被罚穿了一整年黑鞋。是啊。
[00:15:42.090] [SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think he has a wear like black Air Force ones for an entire calendar year or something
[00:15:42.090] [SPEAKER_02]：是的，我觉得他好像有一整年都穿着黑色空军一号鞋。
[00:15:47.050] [SPEAKER_01]: No, we cut that down to we only cut it to like I think like a quarter or something
[00:15:47.050] [SPEAKER_01]：不，我们把它削减到只剩四分之一左右了。
[00:15:51.810] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not even bad. I know I feel like he got off like Scott free
[00:15:51.810] [SPEAKER_01]：那还不算糟。我觉得他简直是逍遥法外。
[00:15:56.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we only like did a random shoe check maybe four times on him too
[00:15:56.590] [SPEAKER_01]：就像我们可能只对他随机检查了四次鞋子一样。
[00:16:01.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because whatever we see him out we're just like Chris
[00:16:01.590] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，因为无论我们看到他出现在哪里，我们都和克里斯一样。
[00:16:04.190] [SPEAKER_01]: Shoot check like you know like and he has to send a picture of his shoes
[00:16:04.190] [SPEAKER_01]：就像你知道的那样，拍张照片，然后他得发一张他鞋子的照片。
[00:16:08.070] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he's like wearing them. I did notice the league that yeah, Jim and Chris are in they're very generous with punishments at the end
[00:16:08.070] [SPEAKER_02]：我敢肯定他就像戴着它们一样。我注意到吉姆和克里斯所在的那个联盟，他们在最后阶段的处罚非常宽容。
[00:16:16.790] [SPEAKER_02]: Cuz yeah, I don't want to call anyone out
[00:16:16.790] [SPEAKER_02]：因为，是的，我不想点名批评任何人。
[00:16:18.970] [SPEAKER_02]: But we our punishment was nine nine nine last year and it was it was not completed
[00:16:18.970] [SPEAKER_02]：但是我们去年受到的惩罚是九九九，而且还没有完成。
[00:16:23.970] [SPEAKER_02]: It was
[00:16:23.970] [SPEAKER_02]：是
[00:16:25.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Somebody did like a five hot dogs and four beers to add up to nine that doesn't cut it
[00:16:25.230] [SPEAKER_02]：有人吃了五个热狗和四瓶啤酒，加起来一共九个，这可不行。
[00:16:32.050] [SPEAKER_01]: But these are sort of like the season you know this season long
[00:16:32.050] [SPEAKER_01]：但这有点像你知道的这个赛季，持续很久。
[00:16:35.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Challenges does your league have sort of like you know in the league that James and I
[00:16:35.470] [SPEAKER_01]：你们联赛有什么挑战吗？就像你知道的，在詹姆斯和我所在的联赛里……
[00:16:39.510] [SPEAKER_01]: And we sort of also have like random side quests that sort of added to the punishment
[00:16:39.510] [SPEAKER_01]：我们还有一些随机的支线任务，这些任务也算是对玩家的一种惩罚。
[00:16:43.010] [SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have
[00:16:43.010] [SPEAKER_01]：你们有
[00:16:44.210] [SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned one right without there any others that
[00:16:44.210] [SPEAKER_01]：你刚才提到了一个，没有提到其他的。
[00:16:47.270] [SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want to elaborate maybe on your side quest ones?
[00:16:47.270] [SPEAKER_01]：或者你想详细说说你的支线任务吗？
[00:16:50.310] [SPEAKER_04]: So are league is heavily influenced off of your league Jim and so yeah, I think if a player score zero on your active
[00:16:50.310] [SPEAKER_04]：所以，吉姆，我们的联赛很大程度上受到了你联赛的影响，所以，是的，我认为如果一个球员在你活跃的联赛中得分为零，那么我们的联赛就会受到很大影响。
[00:16:58.010] [SPEAKER_04]: Line up that's an ice and then the one I mentioned earlier
[00:16:58.010] [SPEAKER_04]：排好队，那是冰块，然后是我之前提到的那个。
[00:17:01.730] [SPEAKER_04]: Which is if your team scores the least points that week then that's also an ice
[00:17:01.730] [SPEAKER_04]：也就是说，如果你的球队那周得分最低，那也是一场冰球比赛。
[00:17:05.970] [SPEAKER_04]: I think those are like the only established ones right now
[00:17:05.970] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得目前只有这些比较成熟了。
[00:17:08.610] [SPEAKER_05]: There were a couple other ones on our pose, but I feel like the more complicated it is the less likely we can like truly enforce it
[00:17:08.610] [SPEAKER_05]：我们还有其他几个关于姿势的问题，但我觉得越复杂，我们就越难真正执行。
[00:17:15.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a good middle ground. We had a really funny one though
[00:17:15.610] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得这算是一个不错的折中方案。不过我们之前确实聊得很开心。
[00:17:18.590] [SPEAKER_04]: There's like a lot of couples in our league and then I was against our other friend Katie on week one
[00:17:18.590] [SPEAKER_04]：我们联赛里有很多情侣，然后第一周我就跟我们另一个朋友凯蒂对决了。
[00:17:25.570] [SPEAKER_04]: My team was shooting the bed and Katie's team was like popping off and then we didn't know this
[00:17:25.570] [SPEAKER_04]：我的团队当时正在拍摄床的镜头，凯蒂的团队则在疯狂拍摄，然后我们就不知道这件事了。
[00:17:31.230] [SPEAKER_04]: But her boyfriend, Avi who's also in the league. He took her phone and wrote wow
[00:17:31.230] [SPEAKER_04]：但她的男朋友艾维（Avi）也是联盟成员。他拿过她的手机，写道：哇
[00:17:36.710] [SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be a close one at Crystal and everyone was like
[00:17:36.710] [SPEAKER_04]：水晶宫的比赛将会很胶着，每个人都这么想。
[00:17:40.330] [SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit like Katie is insane like she's talking and then later Avi confesses like oh
[00:17:40.330] [SPEAKER_04]：我的天哪，凯蒂简直疯了，她一直在胡言乱语，然后后来艾维坦白说……哦
[00:17:46.910] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I should confess it was actually me who did that and we were like okay
[00:17:46.910] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得我应该坦白，其实是我做的，然后我们就觉得好吧。
[00:17:50.230] [SPEAKER_04]: That deserves an ice
[00:17:50.230] [SPEAKER_04]：这值得加冰
[00:17:51.790] [SPEAKER_02]: Just punishable fraud. Yeah
[00:17:51.790] [SPEAKER_02]：就是应受惩罚的欺诈行为。是的。
[00:17:53.830] [SPEAKER_05]: Egregiousness is punishable. Yeah, I thought oh so crazy too is Avi literally was like that's my girl
[00:17:53.830] [SPEAKER_05]：恶劣行径理应受到惩罚。是啊，我也觉得太疯狂了，Avi 居然说“那是我女朋友”。
[00:17:59.290] [SPEAKER_05]: My baby and I was like wow looking back that's actually a stunner
[00:17:59.290] [SPEAKER_05]：我和我的宝宝当时都觉得，哇，现在回头看，这照片真是太惊艳了。
[00:18:04.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Looking back he was typing that on his other hand. Yeah left hand right
[00:18:04.010] [SPEAKER_02]：回想起来，他当时是用另一只手打字的。对，左手，右手。
[00:18:08.390] [SPEAKER_02]: Should they like un-sportsman like condo?
[00:18:08.390] [SPEAKER_02]：他们应该喜欢像公寓那样不讲体育精神的东西吗？
[00:18:11.170] [SPEAKER_04]: That's wild. It's crazy too because last week his team was popping off and he used the exact same line just on his account
[00:18:11.170] [SPEAKER_04]：太疯狂了。更离谱的是，上周他的团队火力全开，而他自己账号上也用了完全一样的台词。
[00:18:19.950] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think in our league so like James your cousin
[00:18:19.950] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我觉得在我们这个级别，就像你表弟詹姆斯一样。
[00:18:23.610] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like he just wants people to drink
[00:18:23.610] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得他只是想让大家喝酒。
[00:18:25.910] [SPEAKER_01]: So last year I went home to like visit and a couple of high school friends we got together
[00:18:25.910] [SPEAKER_01]：所以去年我回家探亲，遇到了几个高中朋友，我们聚到了一起。
[00:18:30.790] [SPEAKER_01]: They're like we just hung out to play like many golf and somehow that turned into a competition where the loser got like a couple of
[00:18:30.790] [SPEAKER_01]：他们就像我们一起出去玩打高尔夫，结果不知怎么的就变成了一场比赛，输的人要了几个……
[00:18:36.490] [SPEAKER_01]: Ises tacked their season long tally. Yeah, I think Chris was trying to like move on other people
[00:18:36.490] [SPEAKER_01]：伊塞斯队追平了他们本赛季的总得分。是的，我觉得克里斯当时是想把注意力转移到其他人身上。
[00:18:42.070] [SPEAKER_01]: But then he ended up getting it for himself nice
[00:18:42.070] [SPEAKER_01]：但后来他自己却得到了它，真不错。
[00:18:45.610] [SPEAKER_01]: That contravises his year end six pack. Oh my god. I will say though
[00:18:45.610] [SPEAKER_01]：那跟他年末练出六块腹肌的目标完全矛盾。我的天哪。不过我得说……
[00:18:49.850] [SPEAKER_05]: I think fantasy is like fostering a big sense of community for me
[00:18:49.850] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得奇幻故事就像是培养了一种强烈的社群意识。
[00:18:53.410] [SPEAKER_05]: Which we always talk about oh yeah, I mean one every year before this the Super Bowl would come around and I'd always be like
[00:18:53.410] [SPEAKER_05]：我们总是谈论这个，哦，是的，我的意思是，以前每年超级碗来临的时候，我总是会说……
[00:18:59.590] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was playing in it like I would never know and now I feel like watching football
[00:18:59.590] [SPEAKER_05]：哦，它就像我永远不会知道的那样播放着，现在我感觉自己想看足球了。
[00:19:03.970] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm like
[00:19:03.970] [SPEAKER_05]：我就像
[00:19:04.950] [SPEAKER_05]: Invested and who's winning or not
[00:19:04.950] [SPEAKER_05]：投资了，谁会赢？谁没赢？
[00:19:07.450] [SPEAKER_04]: You're like if my player doesn't want to get on the Super Bowl. He needs to get off my
[00:19:07.450] [SPEAKER_04]：你这话的意思好像我的球员不想参加超级碗，他就应该离开我的球队。
[00:19:11.430] [SPEAKER_05]: Get off my roster exactly like I could pull up to work and be like oh my god crazy that Cooper cuff got injured like dropping names
[00:19:11.430] [SPEAKER_05]：把我的名单从名单上划掉，就像我上班时突然说“我的天哪，太疯狂了，库珀的袖套受伤了”，然后就随便说点什么。
[00:19:19.130] [SPEAKER_05]: Being all broy so there's some like other benefits to playing fantasy. I think yeah
[00:19:19.130] [SPEAKER_05]：因为我是个兄弟，所以玩奇幻游戏还有一些其他好处。我觉得是的。
[00:19:25.070] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it sometimes also serves as sort of that third setting that people
[00:19:25.070] [SPEAKER_01]：我认为它有时也可以作为第三种设置，让人们……
[00:19:29.210] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of need you have home you have work and then I think in this like post pandemic
[00:19:29.210] [SPEAKER_01]：某种程度上，你需要有家，你需要工作，然后我认为在后疫情时代……
[00:19:34.710] [SPEAKER_01]: You're still coming out of this like looking for that third setting and sometimes like a fantasy leak
[00:19:34.710] [SPEAKER_01]：你仍然像在寻找第三种设定一样，有时就像在寻找幻想的泄露。
[00:19:40.050] [SPEAKER_01]: And almost be like that because
[00:19:40.050] [SPEAKER_01]：几乎就是这样，因为
[00:19:41.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the leak has people you don't really otherwise meet or talk to right and so that sort of brings like another third
[00:19:41.710] [SPEAKER_01]：有时候泄露信息的人是你平时根本不会遇到或交谈的人，所以这就带来了另一种可能性。
[00:19:47.410] [SPEAKER_04]: Group that you can hang out with but that's true like our league right now is
[00:19:47.410] [SPEAKER_04]：你可以和一群人一起玩，但确实如此，就像我们现在的联赛一样。
[00:19:52.910] [SPEAKER_04]: Both coasts and so we're like communicating more with some of our friends who we don't see as often because they're like in the east coast and it's pretty nice
[00:19:52.910] [SPEAKER_04]：东西海岸都有人，所以我们和一些不常见面的朋友联系更频繁了，因为他们住在东海岸，这感觉真好。
[00:20:01.550] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's like really bonding. I guess is it trauma bonding
[00:20:01.550] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我觉得这就像是一种真正的情感联结。我猜这算是创伤联结吧。
[00:20:06.040] [SPEAKER_04]: That kind of yeah, I was definitely trauma bonding yeah, and I guess the 999 whoever does it
[00:20:06.040] [SPEAKER_04]：没错，我肯定有过创伤后依恋，我想999急救中心的人就是这么做的。
[00:20:12.330] [SPEAKER_04]: We'll also be trauma bonding yeah
[00:20:12.330] [SPEAKER_04]：我们也会建立创伤联结，是的。
[00:20:14.350] [SPEAKER_04]: It is just like looming over us
[00:20:14.350] [SPEAKER_04]：它就像笼罩在我们头顶一样。
[00:20:18.850] [SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully my players remember that they play football
[00:20:18.850] [SPEAKER_04]：希望我的球员们记住，他们是在踢足球。
[00:20:22.310] [SPEAKER_02]: That they're paid to playing
[00:20:22.310] [SPEAKER_02]：他们玩游戏是为了赚钱。
[00:20:25.190] [SPEAKER_05]: Well moving a little bit away from fantasy
[00:20:25.190] [SPEAKER_05]：好吧，我们稍微偏离一下幻想的话题。
[00:20:28.430] [SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about general sports and I kind of want to open up this segment by talking about sports philosophy
[00:20:28.430] [SPEAKER_05]：我们来聊聊体育运动，我想先从体育哲学入手来开启这个环节。
[00:20:35.070] [SPEAKER_05]: Which james and I were discussing yesterday and I think a big part of sports philosophy is kind of like what kind of fan are you?
[00:20:35.070] [SPEAKER_05]：昨天我和詹姆斯讨论过这个问题，我认为体育哲学的一个重要部分有点像你是哪种类型的球迷？
[00:20:43.170] [SPEAKER_05]: And like what are you invested into?
[00:20:43.170] [SPEAKER_05]：你投资了哪些领域？
[00:20:45.630] [SPEAKER_05]: For example, some people are really into teams and are like die hard
[00:20:45.630] [SPEAKER_05]：例如，有些人非常热衷于团队，就像死忠粉一样。
[00:20:50.150] [SPEAKER_05]: Lakers fans or whatever other people are more into the players of the player moves teams
[00:20:50.150] [SPEAKER_05]：湖人球迷或者其他更关注球员转会球队的人
[00:20:55.570] [SPEAKER_05]: They're more likely to follow that new team that they're a part of other people like to watch
[00:20:55.570] [SPEAKER_05]：他们更有可能追随自己加入的新球队，因为其他人也喜欢看他们比赛。
[00:21:00.610] [SPEAKER_05]: Every single game while some people really just watch like the highlights rules. So I guess for you guys as sports fans
[00:21:00.610] [SPEAKER_05]：虽然有些人只看集锦，但每场比赛都看。所以我想，对于你们这些体育迷来说……
[00:21:07.050] [SPEAKER_05]: That sports watchers
[00:21:07.050] [SPEAKER_05]：体育观察员
[00:21:08.470] [SPEAKER_05]: What are you more into like what do you prioritize?
[00:21:08.470] [SPEAKER_05]：你更喜欢什么？你优先考虑什么？
[00:21:11.230] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when I was young I used to
[00:21:11.230] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我年轻的时候曾经
[00:21:14.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Watch every game
[00:21:14.230] [SPEAKER_02]：观看每一场比赛
[00:21:16.350] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't have the time and like my team's not doing that well
[00:21:16.350] [SPEAKER_02]：没时间，而且我的团队表现也不太好。
[00:21:21.590] [SPEAKER_02]: So I don't watch like every game. I'll just check in like every few weeks just to see how they're doing
[00:21:21.590] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我不会每场比赛都看。我大概每隔几周会看看他们表现如何。
[00:21:27.130] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think I overall I like teams that win because when you're a kid you're when you're choosing teams
[00:21:27.130] [SPEAKER_02]：但我总体上还是喜欢赢球的球队，因为小时候选球队的时候，你总是会考虑球队的胜负。
[00:21:32.210] [SPEAKER_02]: You're like okay, I'm just gonna pick the people who keep winning every year
[00:21:32.210] [SPEAKER_02]：你会想，好吧，我就选那些每年都赢的人吧。
[00:21:35.630] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I chose my teams. I'm sort of the opposite. I love mediocrity for some reasons
[00:21:35.630] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我就是这样选择我的团队的。我其实和他们正好相反。不知为何，我喜欢平庸。
[00:21:40.330] [SPEAKER_01]: So I always root for the underdog
[00:21:40.330] [SPEAKER_01]：所以我总是支持弱者。
[00:21:42.290] [SPEAKER_01]: Also like growing up for instance
[00:21:42.290] [SPEAKER_01]：比如成长过程
[00:21:44.550] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of my childhood friends were like Lakers fans and I was just like who was the last team to like beat the Lakers?
[00:21:44.550] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得我小时候的很多朋友都是湖人队的球迷，我就问他们，上一次有哪支球队击败过湖人队？
[00:21:51.270] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like those the kings. I'm like I don't know who they are, but they're my team
[00:21:51.270] [SPEAKER_01]：然后你就觉得他们是王者。我就觉得我不知道他们是谁，但他们是我的团队。
[00:21:55.490] [SPEAKER_01]: No, you know that kind of thing
[00:21:55.490] [SPEAKER_01]：不，你知道那种事
[00:21:57.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so then now like I follow a different team that is you know also not very good
[00:21:57.470] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，所以现在我关注的是另一支球队，你知道，那支球队也不太好。
[00:22:01.890] [SPEAKER_01]: But I'll check in on them every now and then just to see how things are
[00:22:01.890] [SPEAKER_01]：但我会时不时地去看看他们，了解一下情况。
[00:22:06.030] [SPEAKER_04]: I try to go by like a city that means something to me
[00:22:06.030] [SPEAKER_04]：我努力像一座对我有意义的城市那样生活。
[00:22:10.490] [SPEAKER_04]: So it's easy to like root for the Canadian team in like basketball other than that
[00:22:10.490] [SPEAKER_04]：所以，除了篮球之外，很容易就会喜欢上加拿大队。
[00:22:16.210] [SPEAKER_04]: I started to like certain players from fantasy and then that kind of made me like their team as well
[00:22:16.210] [SPEAKER_04]：我开始喜欢上一些梦幻橄榄球的球员，然后也渐渐喜欢上了他们的球队。
[00:22:22.230] [SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of insane, but like when I was playing fantasy basketball
[00:22:22.230] [SPEAKER_04]：这有点疯狂，就像我以前玩梦幻篮球的时候一样。
[00:22:26.110] [SPEAKER_04]: I would literally watch any game that had at least one of my players in it and
[00:22:26.110] [SPEAKER_04]：只要有我队球员参加的比赛，我几乎都会看。
[00:22:31.790] [SPEAKER_04]: That's how you win
[00:22:31.790] [SPEAKER_04]：这就是取胜之道
[00:22:33.430] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah
[00:22:33.430] [SPEAKER_04]：是的
[00:22:34.790] [SPEAKER_04]: That's dedication
[00:22:34.790] [SPEAKER_04]：这才是奉献精神。
[00:22:36.390] [SPEAKER_01]: Just watch spoke on like a true champ
[00:22:36.390] [SPEAKER_01]：瞧瞧，他说话像个真正的冠军。
[00:22:39.990] [SPEAKER_04]: But it was fun and I think it's also fun in the beginning too because then you're like really picking up quickly
[00:22:39.990] [SPEAKER_04]：但这很有趣，而且我觉得一开始也很有趣，因为那时候你很快就能上手。
[00:22:45.750] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I used to only follow basketball very casually not really keeping up with anything
[00:22:45.750] [SPEAKER_04]：我以前只是偶尔关注一下篮球，并没有真正关注过其他任何赛事。
[00:22:50.790] [SPEAKER_04]: But then fantasy kind of forces you to keep up with it a lot more
[00:22:50.790] [SPEAKER_04]：但奇幻题材会让你更努力地跟上剧情发展。
[00:22:55.250] [SPEAKER_04]: So you have to know what's going on like what players are injured by the end of like the first season of
[00:22:55.250] [SPEAKER_04]：所以你必须了解情况，比如第一赛季结束时哪些球员受伤了。
[00:23:00.990] [SPEAKER_04]: fantasy basketball I would be like naming certain players and people are like who the hell like I like don't know what you're saying
[00:23:00.990] [SPEAKER_04]：玩梦幻篮球的时候，我会说出一些球员的名字，然后大家就会问“谁啊，我根本不知道你在说什么”。
[00:23:10.190] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I think I don't have the like a tensions fan to do that and just fundamentally
[00:23:10.190] [SPEAKER_05]：我不知道，我觉得我没有那种能做到那种程度的紧张感，而且从根本上来说……
[00:23:15.290] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that into sports to be honest, but I'm like a big highlights real person
[00:23:15.290] [SPEAKER_05]：说实话，我对体育不太感兴趣，但我喜欢看精彩集锦。
[00:23:20.230] [SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like I have access to so much content because everything is new to me
[00:23:20.230] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得我能接触到很多内容，因为一切对我来说都是全新的。
[00:23:24.850] [SPEAKER_05]: For example a couple months ago James was showing me
[00:23:24.850] [SPEAKER_05]：例如，几个月前詹姆斯给我展示过
[00:23:28.270] [SPEAKER_05]: Rearving highlight and I was like this man is amazing
[00:23:28.270] [SPEAKER_05]：看到精彩片段时，我就觉得这个人太棒了。
[00:23:32.070] [SPEAKER_05]: And then I started to get all conflicted on like well he has all these like weird philosophies right that I don't
[00:23:32.070] [SPEAKER_05]：然后我就开始感到很矛盾，觉得他有很多奇怪的哲学观点，而我却不认同。
[00:23:37.950] [SPEAKER_05]: More or less agree with so am I more into like the art like can I separate the art from the artist kind of thing
[00:23:37.950] [SPEAKER_05]：我基本同意，我更喜欢艺术本身，比如我能否将艺术与艺术家分开来看之类的。
[00:23:44.730] [SPEAKER_05]: And I think to an extent I like kind of can
[00:23:44.730] [SPEAKER_05]：而且我觉得在某种程度上，我喜欢这种感觉。
[00:23:47.190] [SPEAKER_05]: To me like highlight reals are a big thing because then I don't have to watch other bits where they're like not playing that well
[00:23:47.190] [SPEAKER_05]：对我来说，精彩集锦很重要，因为这样我就不用去看他们发挥不佳的其他片段了。
[00:23:53.090] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I started to realize I was like yeah fantasy basketball is just like really
[00:23:53.090] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我觉得我开始意识到，嗯，梦幻篮球真的……
[00:23:58.090] [SPEAKER_04]: Taking off so much time. So I had been thinking about quitting for a while and then this year was a perfect excuse
[00:23:58.090] [SPEAKER_04]：我休息了太多时间。所以我早就想辞职了，而今年正好是个完美的借口。
[00:24:04.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Only to join another fan
[00:24:04.010] [SPEAKER_02]：只是为了加入另一个粉丝
[00:24:05.750] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was thinking like football is less of a commitment right but now I'm like do don't I'm like stressing
[00:24:05.750] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我之前觉得踢足球投入的精力比较少，对吧？但现在我又想，要不要踢足球？我感觉压力好大。
[00:24:13.070] [SPEAKER_01]: Do the minute this season started?
[00:24:13.070] [SPEAKER_01]：从本赛季开始的那一刻起？
[00:24:14.970] [SPEAKER_01]: I have the Twitter notifications on for like you know all the player updates and I've noticed my
[00:24:14.970] [SPEAKER_01]：我开启了推特通知，可以接收所有球员动态，我注意到我的
[00:24:19.630] [SPEAKER_01]: Fulon battery usage has just like increased dramatically
[00:24:19.630] [SPEAKER_01]：Fulon电池的使用量似乎大幅增加了。
[00:24:23.010] [SPEAKER_01]: The minute like that first Sunday hit my phone just like
[00:24:23.010] [SPEAKER_01]：就像第一个星期天，我的手机突然响了一样。
[00:24:26.320] [SPEAKER_05]: It's too much. Yeah, I think there was a Sunday a couple weeks ago where we were golfing and crystals team was not doing so hot
[00:24:26.320] [SPEAKER_05]：太过分了。是啊，我想大概两周前的一个星期天，我们去打高尔夫，水晶队当时状态不太好。
[00:24:33.060] [SPEAKER_05]: So she pulled up to the game like already being like I need a drink and then towards the end when we were heading to dinner
[00:24:33.060] [SPEAKER_05]：所以她到球场的时候就已经说着“我需要喝一杯”，然后快结束的时候，我们正准备去吃晚饭。
[00:24:38.860] [SPEAKER_05]: She was so depressed like we need to do it well this check all this girl
[00:24:38.860] [SPEAKER_05]：她非常沮丧，就像我们需要好好检查一下这个女孩的所有情况一样。
[00:24:43.480] [SPEAKER_01]: She texted me she's like I'm gonna be depressed until the superbook
[00:24:43.480] [SPEAKER_01]：她发短信告诉我，她要一直抑郁到超级书出版为止。
[00:24:47.500] [SPEAKER_05]: At least 16 weeks
[00:24:47.500] [SPEAKER_05]：至少16周
[00:24:51.380] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry you'll be done being depressed by the time play awesome
[00:24:51.380] [SPEAKER_01]：别担心，到你玩得开心的时候，你的抑郁情绪就会消失了。
[00:24:54.980] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jesus like I will point does fantasy become fun. I was like
[00:24:54.980] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，耶稣，就像我要指出的那样，幻想会变得有趣吗？我当时就想：
[00:24:58.940] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't know like maybe in like 14 more weeks
[00:24:58.940] [SPEAKER_02]：我不知道，可能还要再过14周吧。
[00:25:01.840] [SPEAKER_04]: Like when it ends my goal isn't even to win. It's just like not lose
[00:25:01.840] [SPEAKER_04]：就像比赛结束时，我的目标甚至不是赢，只是不输。
[00:25:07.100] [SPEAKER_04]: I think another fun aspect of following sports though is that it's actually very very drama filled
[00:25:07.100] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得关注体育的另一个乐趣在于，它实际上充满了戏剧性。
[00:25:13.880] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like reality TV Loki and like I thought the NBA was a bunch of divas but dude football is crazy
[00:25:13.880] [SPEAKER_04]：这就像真人秀版的洛基，我以前觉得NBA球员都是一群耍大牌的，但老兄，橄榄球才是真正的疯狂。
[00:25:21.860] [SPEAKER_04]: People are just sitting out like yeah, you're not gonna pay me
[00:25:21.860] [SPEAKER_04]：人们就这么袖手旁观，好像在说“是啊，你们又不打算付钱给我”。
[00:25:25.400] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not gonna play even though they're like still on a contract and then one of the players Tyre Kill
[00:25:25.400] [SPEAKER_04]：就算他们还有合同在身，我也不会上场，而且其中一个球员还被Tyre Kill干掉了。
[00:25:31.680] [SPEAKER_04]: pulled up week one to his game and he literally got arrested for like shitty driving or something
[00:25:31.680] [SPEAKER_04]：他第一周去比赛的时候，居然因为开车太危险之类的原因被抓了。
[00:25:37.300] [SPEAKER_04]: And then he shows up for the game and people are like damn that's dedication
[00:25:37.300] [SPEAKER_04]：然后他出现在比赛现场，人们都说，哇，这才是敬业精神。
[00:25:41.860] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's crazy like he scored a touchdown that game and his celebration was him getting handcuffs
[00:25:41.860] [SPEAKER_01]：真是太疯狂了，他那场比赛达阵得分，结果庆祝方式却是被戴上手铐。
[00:25:47.660] [SPEAKER_02]: It's wild and it's a wild west and then if I'll like you can kind of just do whatever and like yeah
[00:25:47.660] [SPEAKER_02]：这里很狂野，就像狂野西部一样，然后如果你愿意，你可以随心所欲，就像……
[00:25:53.060] [SPEAKER_02]: The fact that people just sit out games is crazy because like you only play a few times a year
[00:25:53.060] [SPEAKER_02]：有些人竟然会无缘无故地缺席比赛，这太不可思议了，毕竟一年也就玩几次而已。
[00:25:57.160] [SPEAKER_02]: So like you sitting out is like in the NBA the equivalent of like sitting out like 10 games or something
[00:25:57.160] [SPEAKER_02]：所以你缺席比赛，就相当于在NBA里缺席10场比赛之类的。
[00:26:02.480] [SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think I'd like to follow the athletes who are like really drama filled
[00:26:02.480] [SPEAKER_05]：但我并不想关注那些充满戏剧性的运动员。
[00:26:06.620] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm like this is a little much for me. I think I like the kind of
[00:26:06.620] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得这对我来说有点过了。我更喜欢那种……
[00:26:10.100] [SPEAKER_05]: Goody two shoes, you know, they just have like a really chill hobby or something
[00:26:10.100] [SPEAKER_05]：乖乖女，你知道，他们可能只是有个很轻松的爱好之类的。
[00:26:15.380] [SPEAKER_05]: In the NBA kind of like the Austin Reeves liberal on type of people
[00:26:15.380] [SPEAKER_05]：在NBA，有点像奥斯汀·里夫斯那种自由派人士
[00:26:19.120] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean LeBron doesn't really have that much drama, right? No really yeah
[00:26:19.120] [SPEAKER_05]：我的意思是，勒布朗其实没多少狗血剧情，对吧？真的，没错。
[00:26:22.700] [SPEAKER_05]: I like stay away from the tight re-cows
[00:26:22.700] [SPEAKER_05]：我喜欢远离那些紧绷的母牛。
[00:26:25.260] [SPEAKER_04]: Sports, I think yeah agreed that's actually kind of a drafting strategy
[00:26:25.260] [SPEAKER_04]：体育运动，我觉得没错，这实际上是一种选秀策略。
[00:26:30.700] [SPEAKER_04]: At least in basketball like I would try to draft the wholesome people because then they wouldn't sit out games
[00:26:30.700] [SPEAKER_04]：至少在篮球方面，我会尽量挑选那些品行端正的人，因为这样他们就不会缺席比赛了。
[00:26:35.620] [SPEAKER_04]: necessarily because of whatever drama that they're like
[00:26:35.620] [SPEAKER_04]：必然是因为他们喜欢那种戏剧性的东西。
[00:26:39.340] [SPEAKER_04]: involved in or like you know they're not out partying and then you're like oh they play like really bad this day
[00:26:39.340] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道他们没出去玩，或者你知道他们今天没出去玩，然后你就会想，哦，他们今天打得真烂。
[00:26:45.380] [SPEAKER_04]: Like are they okay?
[00:26:45.380] [SPEAKER_04]：他们还好吗？
[00:26:48.040] [SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how fantasy morphs what you think of people to sometimes the player will be like
[00:26:48.040] [SPEAKER_02]：奇幻作品对人物形象的影响真是太大了，有时候玩家会像他们一样看待人物。
[00:26:53.540] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm not playing because I'm having a kid this week. Oh, yeah, and I'm like
[00:26:53.540] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，我不玩，因为我这周要生孩子。哦，对，我就像
[00:26:58.780] [SPEAKER_02]: Happy for you man, but
[00:26:58.780] [SPEAKER_02]：兄弟，为你高兴，但是
[00:27:01.260] [SPEAKER_02]: Maybe come back earlier
[00:27:01.260] [SPEAKER_02]：或许可以早点回来。
[00:27:04.880] [SPEAKER_04]: No, but the good thing is at least I don't know if this is true in football
[00:27:04.880] [SPEAKER_04]：不，但好在至少我不知道这在足球界是否属实。
[00:27:08.180] [SPEAKER_04]: But whenever someone has a kid in basketball
[00:27:08.180] [SPEAKER_04]：但每当有人家孩子打篮球的时候……
[00:27:11.100] [SPEAKER_04]: Once they come back they literally are like a god for a week straight dad buff baby
[00:27:11.100] [SPEAKER_04]：他们回来后简直就像神一样，能持续整整一周，爸爸和宝宝都超棒。
[00:27:16.200] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean Tyre killed like five kids last year so that they're my my correlate
[00:27:16.200] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，我的意思是，泰尔去年杀了五个孩子，所以他们是我的同伙。
[00:27:21.280] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's great. She was great last year
[00:27:21.280] [SPEAKER_01]：太好了。她去年表现就很棒。
[00:27:23.260] [SPEAKER_05]: I also will say I dislike people who have bad sportsmanship like on the court. Oh, yeah
[00:27:23.260] [SPEAKER_05]：我还要说，我讨厌那些在球场上缺乏体育精神的人。哦，是的。
[00:27:30.000] [SPEAKER_05]: Like Dreymon Green people like that. I just can't do yeah very polarizing yes
[00:27:30.000] [SPEAKER_05]：就像德雷蒙·格林那样的人。我就是做不到，是的，非常两极分化。
[00:27:35.920] [SPEAKER_02]: Dirty players know him. I like the strong and silent type of players
[00:27:35.920] [SPEAKER_02]：那些下三滥的玩家都认识他。我喜欢这种沉默寡言、实力强劲的玩家。
[00:27:41.760] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I like notable personalities like someone who is either super intense and and quiet or like
[00:27:41.760] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我喜欢个性鲜明的人，比如那种性格非常强烈又很安静的人，或者像……
[00:27:48.620] [SPEAKER_02]: Extremely loud, but it's like really good. I'm like drawn to that as well. I mean, I don't know
[00:27:48.620] [SPEAKER_02]：声音特别大，但是真的很好听。我也被这种感觉吸引了。我的意思是，我不知道
[00:27:53.720] [SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm just like turned off by cockiness for example like James Harden
[00:27:53.720] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得我就是不喜欢那种自大狂，比如像詹姆斯·哈登那样的人。
[00:27:58.060] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like can have a lot of sass on the court sometimes. I'm like I don't really like that
[00:27:58.060] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得他有时候在球场上太傲慢了。我不太喜欢这样。
[00:28:03.700] [SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy because I feel like there's people who are way sassing over that
[00:28:03.700] [SPEAKER_04]：这太疯狂了，因为我觉得有些人对此非常不满。
[00:28:08.540] [SPEAKER_01]: I would not say James Harden come back
[00:28:08.540] [SPEAKER_01]：我不会说詹姆斯·哈登会回归。
[00:28:10.940] [SPEAKER_04]: But I think I still love knowledge is very small
[00:28:10.940] [SPEAKER_04]：但我认为我仍然热爱知识，而知识非常有限。
[00:28:14.600] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like James Harden tilted his head once and Jesus like oh, I don't like yeah
[00:28:14.600] [SPEAKER_04]：就像詹姆斯·哈登歪了一下头，耶稣就说，哦，我不喜欢这样。
[00:28:18.460] [SPEAKER_04]: I was like that's gonna be a no
[00:28:18.460] [SPEAKER_04]：我当时就想，这肯定不行。
[00:28:21.080] [SPEAKER_01]: That's attitude
[00:28:21.080] [SPEAKER_01]：这就是态度
[00:28:22.800] [SPEAKER_04]: Has like a okay, but I like Luke. Oh, yeah, oh
[00:28:22.800] [SPEAKER_04]：还行吧，不过我喜欢卢克。哦，是啊，哦
[00:28:26.360] [SPEAKER_02]: Patrick Beverly oh, yeah
[00:28:26.360] [SPEAKER_02]：帕特里克·贝弗利 哦，是的
[00:28:28.440] [SPEAKER_04]: God dude is like a man is on the court. All right
[00:28:28.440] [SPEAKER_04]：老兄就像个球场上的男人。好吧
[00:28:31.320] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like yeah, what people don't like are people who are super loud but are not good players
[00:28:31.320] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得，大家不喜欢的就是那些声音特别大但技术不好的玩家。
[00:28:36.460] [SPEAKER_02]: Like Patrick Beverly or a dream on green Dylan Brooks
[00:28:36.460] [SPEAKER_02]：就像帕特里克·贝弗利或绿色的梦想迪伦·布鲁克斯
[00:28:40.460] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, true a lot of people who like talk a lot, but don't show up. Yeah. Okay, so now that we like kind of no sports a little more
[00:28:40.460] [SPEAKER_04]：哦，确实，很多人喜欢夸夸其谈，但却不露面。是啊。好吧，既然我们现在更喜欢体育赛事了，那就这样吧。
[00:28:49.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Great primer
[00:28:49.040] [SPEAKER_01]：很好的入门读物
[00:28:51.780] [SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any like favorite sports to watch? Yes, I please kind of
[00:28:51.780] [SPEAKER_04]：你有没有特别喜欢的体育运动？有，我比较喜欢看。
[00:28:56.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Growing up like high through high school and college, so that's like one of my
[00:28:56.360] [SPEAKER_01]：从高中到大学，我一直都很喜欢吸毒，所以这算是我的一个重要经历。
[00:29:00.500] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of top sports. I enjoy watching I like watching golf too
[00:29:00.500] [SPEAKER_01]：算是比较热门的运动吧。我喜欢看，我也喜欢看高尔夫。
[00:29:04.140] [SPEAKER_01]: Personally playing it is more fun than watching but watching it is also really cool
[00:29:04.140] [SPEAKER_01]：我个人觉得玩比看更有意思，不过看也很酷。
[00:29:08.300] [SPEAKER_01]: And then of course like basketball football those things
[00:29:08.300] [SPEAKER_01]：当然还有篮球、足球之类的东西。
[00:29:11.400] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think like I think tennis is like one of the more fun sports that you can really get into
[00:29:11.400] [SPEAKER_01]：但我认为网球是你能真正投入其中的比较有趣的运动之一。
[00:29:15.480] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't mind also shamelessly plugging like men's volleyball
[00:29:15.480] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我也不介意厚颜无耻地宣传一下男子排球。
[00:29:18.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Also very fun to watch it's very like fast-paced
[00:29:18.580] [SPEAKER_02]：观看也很有趣，节奏很快。
[00:29:22.580] [SPEAKER_02]: But not that popular, so
[00:29:22.580] [SPEAKER_02]：但并不那么受欢迎，所以
[00:29:25.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Do any Olympics though? I remember watching like the Olympic one and I was like there was insane. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:25.380] [SPEAKER_02]：你们看过奥运会吗？我记得看过奥运会，当时我就觉得太疯狂了。是啊，是啊
[00:29:30.260] [SPEAKER_02]: They're all jumping like insane amounts. Yeah, if you like watching the NBA like watching dunkstens stuff
[00:29:30.260] [SPEAKER_02]：他们都跳得飞快。是啊，如果你喜欢看NBA，就像喜欢看扣篮一样。
[00:29:35.500] [SPEAKER_02]: It's like basically that every play
[00:29:35.500] [SPEAKER_02]：基本上每次游戏都是这样
[00:29:37.320] [SPEAKER_05]: I think growing up if I were to watch a sports game it would be because
[00:29:37.320] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得如果我小时候去看体育比赛，那会是因为……
[00:29:41.880] [SPEAKER_05]: Corrio is playing in like a big sports game or something
[00:29:41.880] [SPEAKER_05]：科里奥好像在参加什么大型体育比赛之类的。
[00:29:44.240] [SPEAKER_05]: I watch a lot of soccer and
[00:29:44.240] [SPEAKER_05]：我经常看足球比赛，
[00:29:46.340] [SPEAKER_05]: Baseball actually and to this day I think I kind of enjoy watching those games
[00:29:46.340] [SPEAKER_05]：其实我喜欢看棒球比赛，直到今天我仍然挺喜欢看棒球比赛的。
[00:29:50.800] [SPEAKER_05]: Basketball has been like a new thing for me to watch
[00:29:50.800] [SPEAKER_05]：篮球对我来说就像是一种全新的体验。
[00:29:53.360] [SPEAKER_05]: I think I'd like how fast-paced it is and in contrast is something like soccer
[00:29:53.360] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得我会喜欢它的快节奏，相比之下，它有点像足球。
[00:29:57.200] [SPEAKER_05]: You just have so many more points of mass
[00:29:57.200] [SPEAKER_05]：你的质量点就多得多。
[00:29:59.560] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's always exciting. I don't know. I'm still on the fence about football
[00:29:59.560] [SPEAKER_05]：所以总是很令人兴奋。我不知道。我对足球的态度仍然摇摆不定。
[00:30:03.080] [SPEAKER_05]: Like I don't even think it's enjoyable for me to watch yet
[00:30:03.080] [SPEAKER_05]：感觉我现在都还没觉得看这个有意思。
[00:30:06.700] [SPEAKER_05]: But you know I'm getting that I'm trying to watch some highlights reals to see like what is a good play and what is bad right?
[00:30:06.700] [SPEAKER_05]：但是你知道，我正在尝试观看一些精彩集锦，看看哪些是精彩的进攻，哪些是糟糕的进攻，对吧？
[00:30:12.400] [SPEAKER_05]: Right, but I even like get my head around it a little bit
[00:30:12.400] [SPEAKER_05]：没错，但我甚至想稍微理解一下。
[00:30:14.840] [SPEAKER_04]: I think I can agree. I generally like more fast-paced things so like basketball is pretty fun
[00:30:14.840] [SPEAKER_04]：我想我同意。我通常喜欢节奏快的事情，所以像篮球这样的运动就很有趣。
[00:30:21.800] [SPEAKER_04]: I also like swimming
[00:30:21.800] [SPEAKER_04]：我也喜欢游泳
[00:30:24.200] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, especially like a limpic swimming
[00:30:24.200] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，尤其像奥林匹克游泳那样。
[00:30:26.920] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess I've been getting more into tennis because of Jimin it was surprisingly fun. I was like oh
[00:30:26.920] [SPEAKER_04]：我想我是因为Jimin才开始越来越喜欢网球的，没想到还挺好玩的。我当时就想，哦
[00:30:32.200] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I see the like hype
[00:30:32.200] [SPEAKER_04]：好的，我明白了大家为什么这么喜欢它。
[00:30:33.720] [SPEAKER_04]: This fence here
[00:30:33.720] [SPEAKER_04]：这道栅栏
[00:30:35.340] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't like they're like moaning in time
[00:30:35.340] [SPEAKER_04]：我不喜欢他们像在呻吟一样。
[00:30:37.480] [SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like that's a lot wait that's like the best part
[00:30:37.480] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我就想，这太多了，等等，这才是最精彩的部分
[00:30:41.980] [SPEAKER_04]: There's this one girl we were watching one time
[00:30:41.980] [SPEAKER_04]：有一次我们观察了一个女孩
[00:30:44.840] [SPEAKER_04]: Her grunt was like wait or like dude. She's literally like more you on the corner
[00:30:44.840] [SPEAKER_04]：她哼了一声，像是在说“等等”或者“老兄”。她简直就像在说“你站在街角”。
[00:30:51.260] [SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Yelena Austin
[00:30:51.260] [SPEAKER_01]：向叶莲娜·奥斯汀致敬
[00:30:53.740] [SPEAKER_04]: And then there was like this match we were watching at the US open this year
[00:30:53.740] [SPEAKER_04]：然后还有我们今年在美国网球公开赛上看的那场比赛。
[00:30:58.700] [SPEAKER_04]: The guy was just like silent. I think it was Medvedev
[00:30:58.700] [SPEAKER_04]：那家伙就那么沉默不语。我想那是梅德韦杰夫。
[00:31:01.860] [SPEAKER_04]: He was like not grunting at all and then this young guy up against him was like grunting and I was like damn Medvedev is just like so quiet
[00:31:01.860] [SPEAKER_04]：他几乎没发出任何哼声，然后跟他对打的那个年轻人就开始哼哼唧唧，我就想，天哪，梅德韦杰夫真是太安静了。
[00:31:08.820] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't even want to root for him in real life right now
[00:31:08.820] [SPEAKER_04]：我现在甚至都不想在现实生活中支持他。
[00:31:11.280] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like I'll root for the young dude who's putting in the effort
[00:31:11.280] [SPEAKER_04]：我会支持那个努力奋斗的年轻人。
[00:31:15.100] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the grunting is so performative you know
[00:31:15.100] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得这种哼哼声太做作了，你知道吗？
[00:31:19.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I also like have not really played tennis but I like the quiet people. Yeah
[00:31:19.000] [SPEAKER_05]：我的意思是，虽然我不太会打网球，但我喜欢安静的人。是的。
[00:31:23.900] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm just surprised they can keep it up for two hours of grunting
[00:31:23.900] [SPEAKER_02]：我只是很惊讶他们能连续哼哼唧唧两个小时。
[00:31:27.600] [SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel like that's
[00:31:27.600] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得就像那样
[00:31:29.180] [SPEAKER_05]: Extremely draining. I also wonder sometimes if they like perfect their mode. Oh, how do I make it sound more cool or like sound less annoying?
[00:31:29.180] [SPEAKER_05]：真是太累了。我有时也在想，他们是不是喜欢把自己的模式调得完美。哎，怎样才能让它听起来更酷，或者不那么烦人呢？
[00:31:37.440] [SPEAKER_04]: And they like shape it at home. I don't know. Do you grant one you play tennis?
[00:31:37.440] [SPEAKER_04]：他们喜欢在家练习。我不知道。你承认你会打网球吗？
[00:31:41.280] [SPEAKER_01]: Just when I'm making fun of people. Oh, but I think it does serve as sort of like a metronom almost sometimes it helps with their rhythm
[00:31:41.280] [SPEAKER_01]：就在我取笑别人的时候。哦，但我认为它有时确实能起到类似节拍器的作用，帮助他们把握节奏。
[00:31:47.820] [SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing sometimes they just do it to like fuck with other people
[00:31:47.820] [SPEAKER_01]：有时候他们做这种事只是为了捉弄别人。
[00:31:51.980] [SPEAKER_01]: I really like joke a bitch like on on the court and this is some of his off-course stuff not so much
[00:31:51.980] [SPEAKER_01]：我真的很喜欢在球场上和人开玩笑，但这些是他场外的一些事，就没那么有趣了。
[00:31:56.640] [SPEAKER_01]: But he can either be very quiet or he can also like run depending on like the level of intensity
[00:31:56.640] [SPEAKER_01]：但他有时可能非常安静，有时也可能跑来跑去，这取决于强度级别。
[00:32:02.480] [SPEAKER_04]: Just strategy
[00:32:02.480] [SPEAKER_04]：只是策略而已
[00:32:04.020] [SPEAKER_02]: Wow, so if you're playing him and he's not grunting it's just like mental mental damage
[00:32:04.020] [SPEAKER_02]：哇，所以如果你扮演他，而他不发出呻吟声，那就相当于精神上的创伤。
[00:32:08.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's not like rough in a doll right is very much yelling when he plays and sure
[00:32:08.640] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，他不像个粗鲁的娃娃，玩的时候确实会大喊大叫，当然了。
[00:32:14.440] [SPEAKER_01]: I think fatter is like dead quiet like occasionally
[00:32:14.440] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得胖就像死寂一样，偶尔会这样。
[00:32:17.240] [SPEAKER_01]: He makes like a little grunt of exertion and joke of it just like kind of in the middle where he's like you can hear him like making some noise
[00:32:17.240] [SPEAKER_01]：他像是费力地哼了一声，还开了个玩笑，就在中间，你能听到他发出一些声音。
[00:32:24.640] [SPEAKER_01]: But not too much
[00:32:24.640] [SPEAKER_01]：但不要太多
[00:32:25.920] [SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of perfecting your grunt when I was like he had I used to practice the dolls grunt
[00:32:25.920] [SPEAKER_02]：说到练习哼哼声，我小时候也像他那样，经常练习玩偶的哼哼声。
[00:32:30.840] [SPEAKER_02]: I have it down like it's really good
[00:32:30.840] [SPEAKER_02]：我已经掌握得非常好了。
[00:32:36.520] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah
[00:32:36.520] [SPEAKER_02]：是的
[00:32:37.080] [SPEAKER_02]: And he does the double club twirl into a spot scratch
[00:32:37.080] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他做了个双杆旋转，接着又做了个原地刮擦动作。
[00:32:42.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Into a spot scratch yeah, he always scratches but every every play. Yeah, so if you watch him play
[00:32:42.960] [SPEAKER_01]：他总是抓挠，每次都抓挠。是的，所以如果你看他比赛的话。
[00:32:48.720] [SPEAKER_01]: He has a he has a very fixed routine
[00:32:48.720] [SPEAKER_01]：他有非常固定的作息时间。
[00:32:51.160] [SPEAKER_01]: So he like he's bouncing it he picks that his ass like twice
[00:32:51.160] [SPEAKER_01]：所以他就像在弹跳，他把屁股弹了两下。
[00:32:56.260] [SPEAKER_01]: In tennis because you switch sides every couple games
[00:32:56.260] [SPEAKER_01]：在网球中，因为每隔几局就要换边。
[00:32:59.160] [SPEAKER_01]: He always has two water bottles and the labels will face whatever side he's on so keep always adjusted
[00:32:59.160] [SPEAKER_01]：他总是带着两个水瓶，标签会朝向他站着的哪一边，所以要时刻注意调整。
[00:33:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Super OCD he's very OCD
[00:33:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]：他有严重的强迫症，非常严重。
[00:33:07.020] [SPEAKER_01]: We just a hair thing too, right?
[00:33:07.020] [SPEAKER_01]：我们也只是在关注头发而已，对吧？
[00:33:09.220] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's a lot of like
[00:33:09.220] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得有很多类似这样的东西
[00:33:13.040] [SPEAKER_05]: Super sticiousness and neuroticness
[00:33:13.040] [SPEAKER_05]：过度谨慎和神经质
[00:33:15.580] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's like you always hear about the
[00:33:15.580] [SPEAKER_05]：我的天哪，就像你总是听到……
[00:33:18.340] [SPEAKER_05]: Pre-game routines with like the chalk or whatever
[00:33:18.340] [SPEAKER_05]：赛前例行程序，比如用镁粉之类的
[00:33:21.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like golfers will also have like a long set of routine which I'm always like oh my god, it's so fascinating dude
[00:33:21.000] [SPEAKER_05]：我觉得高尔夫球手也会有一套很长的例行程序，我总是觉得，我的天哪，这太迷人了！
[00:33:27.400] [SPEAKER_04]: I think is it Patrick Mahomes who's who's like I only wear one pair of underwear for like any game
[00:33:27.400] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得是帕特里克·马霍姆斯说的，他好像每场比赛都只穿一条内裤。
[00:33:34.460] [SPEAKER_04]: He's lucky under a
[00:33:34.460] [SPEAKER_04]：他很幸运，在……
[00:33:36.200] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's because professional sports is rooted in like routine because like you can't go through a full season
[00:33:36.200] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得这是因为职业体育非常注重常规，因为你不可能完整地经历一个赛季。
[00:33:41.820] [SPEAKER_02]: Without having like a set schedule every day especially when you're that like rich and famous to
[00:33:41.820] [SPEAKER_02]：尤其是当你像你这样富有又有名的时候，如果没有每天固定的作息时间就很难安排好。
[00:33:47.400] [SPEAKER_02]: You need to find time to just like have your like consistent routine
[00:33:47.400] [SPEAKER_02]：你需要抽出时间来养成规律的作息习惯。
[00:33:50.720] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they travel a lot too. Actually. Yeah, I noticed like I was at a pro golf tournament the other day
[00:33:50.720] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，他们也经常到处旅行。确实如此。嗯，我注意到，比如前几天我去参加一个职业高尔夫锦标赛的时候。
[00:33:56.880] [SPEAKER_01]: And just one player he was like teeing off the drive or whatever and there was no one in the way
[00:33:56.880] [SPEAKER_01]：当时只有一个球员在开球，或者做其他什么动作，前面没有人挡路。
[00:34:01.560] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think there was like maybe one volunteer who thought that they were standing out of the way or something
[00:34:01.560] [SPEAKER_01]：但我认为可能只有一名志愿者以为自己站在安全位置之类的。
[00:34:06.540] [SPEAKER_01]: And the guy is caddy and this happened like twice down around would just ask them to like move ever
[00:34:06.540] [SPEAKER_01]：那家伙是球童，这种情况在球场上发生过两次，他们会要求他们挪一下。
[00:34:11.060] [SPEAKER_01]: Slightly in a direction and to me I felt like oh there's makes no difference but to the
[00:34:11.060] [SPEAKER_01]：稍微偏向某个方向，对我来说感觉好像没什么区别，但是对于……
[00:34:15.700] [SPEAKER_01]: Gulf or I think they made like the world of difference in terms of like
[00:34:15.700] [SPEAKER_01]：海湾石油，或者我觉得他们在这方面带来了巨大的改变，比如
[00:34:19.160] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe his spatial perception or something so it's like very like down to those details. You know
[00:34:19.160] [SPEAKER_01]：也许是他的空间感知能力之类的，所以非常注重这些细节。你知道的。
[00:34:24.860] [SPEAKER_05]: They're devils
[00:34:24.860] [SPEAKER_05]：他们是魔鬼
[00:34:26.680] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like pro sports like a lot of athletes have OCD yeah, that's how they can play hours without getting bored of it too
[00:34:26.680] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我觉得很多职业运动员都有强迫症，所以他们才能连续打好几个小时都不觉得无聊。
[00:34:33.840] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like there's like this one guy Westbrook who always eats like a pvn jv
[00:34:33.840] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得威斯布鲁克这家伙总是吃得像个二流选手。
[00:34:39.160] [SPEAKER_04]: Poor games
[00:34:39.160] [SPEAKER_04]：游戏很糟糕
[00:34:40.700] [SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone else also like just throw up before a big game? Wait, well, yeah a lot of players
[00:34:40.700] [SPEAKER_01]：还有谁跟我一样喜欢在大赛前呕吐吗？等等，嗯，是的，很多球员都这样。
[00:34:44.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Storping the bathroom before the play. No, I think a Michael Jordan you said throw up like before a lot of his games
[00:34:44.880] [SPEAKER_02]：赛前去厕所。不，我觉得你说的是迈克尔·乔丹，就像他很多比赛前那样呕吐。
[00:34:50.520] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god really?
[00:34:50.520] [SPEAKER_04]：我的天啊，真的吗？
[00:34:52.060] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like nerves I guess. Yeah, well, I think it was Josh Allen who throws it like oh
[00:34:52.060] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，我想大概是紧张吧。是啊，我觉得是乔什·艾伦扔球扔得像……哦
[00:34:57.440] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so I think so oh so it's like performance dude
[00:34:57.440] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我也这么觉得，哦，所以这就像是表演一样，伙计。
[00:35:01.440] [SPEAKER_04]: Josh Allen is a great quarter
[00:35:01.440] [SPEAKER_04]：乔什·艾伦是个很棒的四分卫
[00:35:03.340] [SPEAKER_05]: You went through fantasy
[00:35:03.340] [SPEAKER_05]：你经历过幻想
[00:35:06.740] [SPEAKER_04]: So I need to get some some players who throw up before their games new checklist vomit her
[00:35:06.740] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我需要把一些赛前呕吐的球员列入新的检查清单，让她吐出来。
[00:35:14.320] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a funny question for us all
[00:35:14.320] [SPEAKER_04]：好的，我有一个有趣的问题想问大家。
[00:35:16.760] [SPEAKER_04]: What sport do you think produces the best bodes?
[00:35:16.760] [SPEAKER_04]：你认为哪项运动能造就最好的身材？
[00:35:21.320] [SPEAKER_02]: I think it's soccer for men like there's no there's no question. I feel like it might be football
[00:35:21.320] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得这就像男子足球一样，毫无疑问。我觉得它也可能是一种足球运动。
[00:35:26.380] [SPEAKER_05]: football like defensive football players. Okay
[00:35:26.380] [SPEAKER_05]：足球就像防守型足球运动员一样。好的
[00:35:31.500] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know the right terminology, but you know yeah
[00:35:31.500] [SPEAKER_05]：我的意思是，我不知道正确的术语，但是你知道，是的
[00:35:35.040] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like football tends to create like at least for the positions you're talking about like some very like lean
[00:35:35.040] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得足球往往会造就一些非常倾向性的球员，至少在你提到的这些位置上是这样。
[00:35:40.160] [SPEAKER_02]: muscular giant bodies. Oh like linebackers their lean defensive ends. Yeah
[00:35:40.160] [SPEAKER_02]：肌肉发达的巨人。哦，就像橄榄球的线卫和他们精瘦的防守端锋一样。是的。
[00:35:46.620] [SPEAKER_02]: Lineback they're lean for their um size like they're not lean people for sure
[00:35:46.620] [SPEAKER_02]：后卫们身材很精瘦，跟他们的体型相比，他们肯定不是那种很瘦的人。
[00:35:51.620] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean they're like like six eight to you know two twenty two thirty like oh
[00:35:51.620] [SPEAKER_01]：我的意思是，他们大概六英尺八英寸到两英尺二十二英寸三十英寸，哦
[00:35:56.240] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay, oh muscle. Oh muscle. Yeah. It's like very little body fat
[00:35:56.240] [SPEAKER_01]：好的，哦，肌肉。哦，肌肉。是的。体脂率非常低。
[00:35:58.880] [SPEAKER_04]: Damn. She's who likes muscular guys. I think so. I think I'm into like chesty dude
[00:35:58.880] [SPEAKER_04]：我去。她喜欢肌肉男。我觉得是。我好像也喜欢胸肌发达的那种。
[00:36:02.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Awesome. Not soccer because soccer produces no chest. Yeah. Okay
[00:36:02.960] [SPEAKER_02]：太棒了。不是足球，因为足球练不出胸肌。是啊。好的
[00:36:07.800] [SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly Jim and said that tennis players also don't have chest
[00:36:07.800] [SPEAKER_04]：令人惊讶的是，吉姆说网球运动员也没有胸部
[00:36:12.440] [SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like disruptive to their swing. Oh
[00:36:12.440] [SPEAKER_04]：因为这会打乱他们的节奏。哦
[00:36:15.860] [SPEAKER_02]: But their farmers tend is crazy. Their tans are insane
[00:36:15.860] [SPEAKER_02]：但他们的农民太疯狂了。他们的肤色简直惨不忍睹。
[00:36:20.880] [SPEAKER_04]: Golf and tennis tans are crazy
[00:36:20.880] [SPEAKER_04]：打高尔夫球和网球晒出的肤色太疯狂了
[00:36:23.380] [SPEAKER_01]: The golf hat 10 is absurd when they take off their hats like shake hands
[00:36:23.380] [SPEAKER_01]：高尔夫球帽10号戴起来太荒谬了，他们摘帽子就像握手一样。
[00:36:28.100] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like that's a band of whites
[00:36:28.100] [SPEAKER_01]：就好像那是一群白人
[00:36:32.600] [SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of tens I think swimming produces good bodies
[00:36:32.600] [SPEAKER_04]：说到十分，我觉得游泳能练出好身材。
[00:36:37.060] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh I actually don't think like I don't think I agree personally
[00:36:37.060] [SPEAKER_05]：哦，其实我并不这么认为，我个人并不同意。
[00:36:40.980] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like summer's bodies are a little too wide at the top and a little too skinny in the middle
[00:36:40.980] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我觉得夏天的身材上半身有点太宽，下半身有点太瘦。
[00:36:46.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Dreaders. Yeah, it's like a exactly streamed
[00:36:46.380] [SPEAKER_02]：Dreaders。是的，就像是完全流媒体播放一样。
[00:36:48.700] [SPEAKER_04]: But aren't football players Doritos?
[00:36:48.700] [SPEAKER_04]：但是足球运动员不就是多力多滋吗？
[00:36:51.140] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I think because they have more muscle at the bottom still
[00:36:51.140] [SPEAKER_05]：是啊，但我觉得是因为他们下半身肌肉更发达。
[00:36:54.880] [SPEAKER_05]: It kind of balances out a little bit and I think I don't know so members have like long torso
[00:36:54.880] [SPEAKER_05]：这样多少有点平衡，而且我觉得我不知道，所以成员们的躯干比较长。
[00:37:00.160] [SPEAKER_05]: Right like I feel like that's beneficial to being against women. Yeah, and I'm not as into that
[00:37:00.160] [SPEAKER_05]：对，我觉得那样反而有利于反对女性。是啊，我不太赞同那样。
[00:37:04.560] [SPEAKER_01]: The proportions are different. Yeah, I would say like tennis players I think of pretty good physics for the most part
[00:37:04.560] [SPEAKER_01]：比例不一样。是的，我觉得网球运动员大多都遵循相当不错的物理定律。
[00:37:11.120] [SPEAKER_01]: But I agree with James as well like men's soccer like when they take off their shirts it is quite despactical
[00:37:11.120] [SPEAKER_01]：但我同意詹姆斯的观点，就像男子足球运动员脱掉上衣那样，确实很开放。
[00:37:18.720] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think soccer makes sense because they run a lot and I feel like runners legs are like nice
[00:37:18.720] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我觉得足球很合理，因为他们跑动很多，我觉得跑步者的腿很舒服。
[00:37:25.020] [SPEAKER_02]: Cardio specific and sports like soccer or tennis
[00:37:25.020] [SPEAKER_02]：有氧运动以及足球或网球等运动。
[00:37:28.320] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very lean. I actually saw some videos of like soccer like just teams like the players doing their training
[00:37:28.320] [SPEAKER_01]：是的，非常精简。我之前看过一些足球队的训练视频，就是球员们训练的那种。
[00:37:35.300] [SPEAKER_01]: Not just practicing on the field but also the off-field training like in the gym and stuff
[00:37:35.300] [SPEAKER_01]：不仅是场上的训练，还有场下的训练，比如在健身房之类的。
[00:37:39.720] [SPEAKER_01]: And they do a lot more explosive work than I thought and I think that also promotes you know like muscle growth
[00:37:39.720] [SPEAKER_01]：而且他们做的爆发力训练比我想象的要多得多，我认为这也有助于肌肉生长。
[00:37:44.840] [SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at track and feel all right all the sprinters are generally very muscular as well
[00:37:44.840] [SPEAKER_01]：所以当你观察田径比赛时，你会发现所有短跑运动员通常肌肉都很发达。
[00:37:49.200] [SPEAKER_01]: Because they work on so much of the explosive stuff and so I think that helps soccer players
[00:37:49.200] [SPEAKER_01]：因为他们做了很多爆发力训练，所以我认为这对足球运动员很有帮助。
[00:37:53.240] [SPEAKER_01]: They both have that both that explosive like physique as well as the endurance from running for
[00:37:53.240] [SPEAKER_01]：他们俩都拥有那种爆发力十足的体格，以及跑步带来的耐力。
[00:37:59.160] [SPEAKER_05]: Well kind of continuing this conversation of like best buds. Who do you think are your personal all-time hottest athletes?
[00:37:59.160] [SPEAKER_05]：嗯，我们继续聊聊好朋友之间的话题。你觉得你心目中最帅的运动员是谁？
[00:38:07.240] [SPEAKER_02]: I think for men it's
[00:38:07.240] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得对男人来说是这样
[00:38:08.900] [SPEAKER_02]: easily
[00:38:08.900] [SPEAKER_02]：容易
[00:38:11.020] [SPEAKER_02]: Ronaldo probably yeah, I can't really think of anyone else who would be brought up that quickly
[00:38:11.020] [SPEAKER_02]：罗纳尔多大概是吧，我实在想不出还有谁会这么快就被提起。
[00:38:15.980] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess yeah, he's like so famous back on Olivia's erode
[00:38:15.980] [SPEAKER_04]：我想是的，他以前在奥利维亚的《Ereode》里可是很有名的。
[00:38:20.700] [SPEAKER_01]: He's a French striker. He's an MLS now. I saw him for the first time in the world cup
[00:38:20.700] [SPEAKER_01]：他是一名法国前锋，现在效力于美国职业足球大联盟（MLS）。我第一次见到他是在世界杯上。
[00:38:24.780] [SPEAKER_01]: Also sure less and I was like whoa
[00:38:24.780] [SPEAKER_01]：而且肯定更少，我当时就想，哇哦
[00:38:28.120] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm something a pattern
[00:38:28.120] [SPEAKER_05]：我是一种模式
[00:38:30.080] [SPEAKER_01]: But his hair is fantastic. I was like how do you run for a whole neck?
[00:38:30.080] [SPEAKER_01]：但他的头发太棒了。我当时就想，怎么能跑出一整个脖子那么长的头发？
[00:38:34.180] [SPEAKER_01]: Your hair is just like intact. I don't know like French soccer players something just something about it
[00:38:34.180] [SPEAKER_01]：你的头发看起来完好无损。我不知道，就像法国足球运动员那样，就是感觉有点不一样。
[00:38:38.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this is like the thing where when guys start working out to like get girls
[00:38:38.900] [SPEAKER_04]：哥们儿，这就像有些男生为了泡妞而开始健身一样。
[00:38:43.200] [SPEAKER_04]: But then only guys
[00:38:43.200] [SPEAKER_04]：但只有男生
[00:38:46.940] [SPEAKER_05]: So true
[00:38:46.940] [SPEAKER_05]：确实如此
[00:38:48.960] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this might be personally biased but speaking of good hair, Luca, Don Church and his good hair
[00:38:48.960] [SPEAKER_05]：好吧，这可能有点个人偏见，但说到好头发，卢卡、唐·丘奇和他那头好头发……
[00:38:54.520] [SPEAKER_02]: Was pretty hot like when he was a rookie. Mm-hmm. That's true
[00:38:54.520] [SPEAKER_02]：他刚出道的时候确实很火。嗯，没错。
[00:38:58.480] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what his hair was oh my god
[00:38:58.480] [SPEAKER_05]：我不记得他的头发是什么样子了，我的天哪
[00:39:00.320] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna pull it up when he used to actually do his hair that dude's got that dude goes like super cuts now
[00:39:00.320] [SPEAKER_01]：我要找出他以前做头发的时候的视频，那家伙现在都去超级理发店了。
[00:39:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't think he gets hair cuts now
[00:39:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，不，我觉得他现在不剪头发了。
[00:39:07.380] [SPEAKER_01]: I think like his wife is my husband's cut this
[00:39:07.380] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得就像他妻子是我丈夫的……
[00:39:10.960] [SPEAKER_05]: Also lip bronjames
[00:39:10.960] [SPEAKER_05]：还有嘴唇布朗詹姆斯
[00:39:12.040] [SPEAKER_05]: I think would make my top five
[00:39:12.040] [SPEAKER_05]：我认为他会进入我的前五名。
[00:39:14.080] [SPEAKER_05]: The should I cut that or
[00:39:14.080] [SPEAKER_05]：我应该剪掉它吗？
[00:39:16.180] [SPEAKER_05]: Why
[00:39:16.180] [SPEAKER_05]：为什么
[00:39:18.120] [SPEAKER_05]: That was a real opinion of
[00:39:18.120] [SPEAKER_05]：那是一种真实的看法
[00:39:20.860] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh Jimmy Garapolo
[00:39:20.860] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，吉米·加拉波罗
[00:39:22.580] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, yes
[00:39:22.580] [SPEAKER_05]：我的天哪，是的
[00:39:26.520] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry he's not good. He's not relevant
[00:39:26.520] [SPEAKER_02]：别担心，他不行。他无关紧要。
[00:39:30.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Actually so in one of my leagues one of the managers she is
[00:39:30.360] [SPEAKER_01]：实际上，在我所在的一个联赛里，其中一位经理是她
[00:39:34.660] [SPEAKER_01]: Obsessed with Jimmy Garapolo and she actually drafted him and just stashed him out of sheer respect
[00:39:34.660] [SPEAKER_01]：她非常迷恋吉米·加拉波罗，她甚至真的选了他，然后出于纯粹的尊重把他雪藏了起来。
[00:39:40.860] [SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's impressive. I was like dude you're beating everyone with like one roster spot
[00:39:40.860] [SPEAKER_01]：哇，太厉害了。我当时就想，兄弟，你只用一个名额就打败了所有人。
[00:39:46.340] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's good looking while he kind of looks like um like actor
[00:39:46.340] [SPEAKER_05]：是啊，他长得挺帅的，有点像……演员。
[00:39:50.480] [SPEAKER_05]: Dude yeah, he's like bad at acting though
[00:39:50.480] [SPEAKER_05]：兄弟，是啊，他演技确实很烂。
[00:39:54.760] [SPEAKER_04]: God is fair. I mean I guess out of football players like the people who I wanted to draft were
[00:39:54.760] [SPEAKER_04]：上帝是公平的。我的意思是，我想在那些我想选的足球运动员中……
[00:40:00.520] [SPEAKER_04]: Like a man raw same brown and sick one
[00:40:00.520] [SPEAKER_04]：就像一个生的、棕色的、生病的男人
[00:40:04.120] [SPEAKER_04]: What's his life?
[00:40:04.120] [SPEAKER_04]：他的人生是怎样的？
[00:40:05.020] [SPEAKER_04]: Barley they're tiny dudes. Oh, but they got great smiles
[00:40:05.020] [SPEAKER_04]：他们个子很小，但是笑容灿烂。
[00:40:08.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Jalen hurts as well, right?
[00:40:08.960] [SPEAKER_02]：杰伦也受伤了，对吧？
[00:40:10.740] [SPEAKER_04]: Jalen hurts was like he's consistently on the like top five hottest NFL players
[00:40:10.740] [SPEAKER_04]：杰伦·赫茨（Jalen Hurts）一直都是NFL最炙手可热的五位球员之一。
[00:40:16.220] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think he's like okay. He's a pretty slender body
[00:40:16.220] [SPEAKER_02]：但我认为他还可以。他身材很苗条。
[00:40:19.040] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we have to mention Nick Boca. He's pretty up there. Loki CMC is also kind of good looking
[00:40:19.040] [SPEAKER_05]：我的意思是，我觉得我们必须提一下尼克·博卡。他演得相当不错。洛基和CMC的造型也挺好看的。
[00:40:26.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Uh
[00:40:26.880] [SPEAKER_02]：呃
[00:40:27.380] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh really I think it's like a model. He's very square. I think CMC is a bit like rectangular
[00:40:27.380] [SPEAKER_04]：哦，真的吗？我觉得他像个模特。他很方正。我觉得CMC有点像长方形。
[00:40:34.740] [SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, he's like not bad looking. He's kind of like handsome Squidward
[00:40:34.740] [SPEAKER_04]：不过，他长得还不错。有点像帅气的章鱼哥。
[00:40:39.680] [SPEAKER_01]: Like it's yeah, yeah, if he had spun broad body
[00:40:39.680] [SPEAKER_01]：就像，是啊，是啊，如果他当时转过身来，身体就完全不一样了。
[00:40:43.820] Hahaha
[00:40:43.820] 哈哈哈哈
[00:40:45.940] [SPEAKER_01]: I watched like a lot of tennis growing up so like I see a lot of the European tennis players
[00:40:45.940] [SPEAKER_01]：我从小就看很多网球比赛，所以我经常看到欧洲网球选手。
[00:40:50.000] [SPEAKER_01]: So there was one check guy Tomas Bariditch. He was like this like six five like hunk
[00:40:50.000] [SPEAKER_01]：当时有个收银员叫托马斯·巴里迪奇。他身高大概六尺五寸，是个肌肉男。
[00:40:55.100] [SPEAKER_01]: Very good at tennis too, and then he ended up marrying like a super model but he was you know very attractive as well
[00:40:55.100] [SPEAKER_01]：他网球也打得很好，后来娶了个超级名模，不过他本人也很有魅力。
[00:41:00.180] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, so he have tennis players Mateo Baritini dude. He's so good looking you'll pull up a photo
[00:41:00.180] [SPEAKER_04]：我的天哪，他居然和网球运动员马特奥·巴里蒂尼合作过。他长得太帅了，你肯定会忍不住去搜他的照片。
[00:41:07.700] [SPEAKER_04]: I will I will I don't know any tennis player do this guy like should not be playing tennis
[00:41:07.700] [SPEAKER_04]：我会，我会，我不认识任何网球运动员像这家伙一样，他根本不应该打网球。
[00:41:12.780] [SPEAKER_01]: He he signed an endorsement with like Hugo Boss and so when Crystal and I we went to New York for the US open
[00:41:12.780] [SPEAKER_01]：他跟Hugo Boss签了代言合同，所以当我和克里斯托尔去纽约参加美国网球公开赛的时候。
[00:41:17.960] [SPEAKER_01]: We swam by the boss door and she was like taking photos of the store. She's like oh Mateo gonna be here
[00:41:17.960] [SPEAKER_01]：我们游到老板门口，她正在给店里拍照。她好像在说，哦，马特奥要来了。
[00:41:25.100] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, my dream is to bump into him in New York during the US open
[00:41:25.100] [SPEAKER_04]：老兄，我的梦想就是在美国网球公开赛期间在纽约偶遇他。
[00:41:29.920] [SPEAKER_02]: You should probably go there in her first week then that that just means he's not playing like
[00:41:29.920] [SPEAKER_02]：那你最好在她第一周就去，那只能说明他没在认真玩。
[00:41:34.320] [SPEAKER_02]: Did he get KO
[00:41:34.320] [SPEAKER_02]：他被击倒了吗？
[00:41:36.140] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he lost like second round this year. Yeah, okay. He used to be good
[00:41:36.140] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，他今年好像第二轮就输了。好吧。他以前很厉害的。
[00:41:39.900] [SPEAKER_01]: But he's just like a lot of injuries lately, you know, but to be fair he lost to like this years finalist
[00:41:39.900] [SPEAKER_01]：但他最近伤病不断，你知道的，不过公平地说，他输给了今年的决赛选手。
[00:41:46.340] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like he lost to a nobody
[00:41:46.340] [SPEAKER_01]：所以他输给的并不是个无名小卒。
[00:41:49.300] [SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think that brings up a question I wanted to ask you guys which is injuries
[00:41:49.300] [SPEAKER_05]：实际上，我想这引出了一个我想问大家的问题，那就是伤病。
[00:41:53.260] [SPEAKER_05]: And if I get to very natural part of sports cuz sports obviously so physical
[00:41:53.260] [SPEAKER_05]：如果我谈到体育运动中非常自然的部分，因为体育运动显然是非常考验体能的。
[00:41:57.380] [SPEAKER_05]: But when someone gets injured do you guys think oh so unlucky like it's too bad that guy got injured or do you think
[00:41:57.380] [SPEAKER_05]：但是当有人受伤时，你们会觉得“哦，真倒霉，那家伙受伤了太可惜了”吗？还是你们会想……
[00:42:05.040] [SPEAKER_05]: Avoiding injuries is also a part of your job as an athlete. I think it's like a mixture of both
[00:42:05.040] [SPEAKER_05]：避免受伤也是运动员职责的一部分。我认为这介于两者之间。
[00:42:11.360] [SPEAKER_01]: A professional athlete, right? Is responsible for taking care of his or her
[00:42:11.360] [SPEAKER_01]：职业运动员，对吧？有责任照顾好自己的……
[00:42:15.980] [SPEAKER_01]: Body for the duration of the career but
[00:42:15.980] [SPEAKER_01]：在整个职业生涯期间的身体，但是
[00:42:18.200] [SPEAKER_01]: One example that comes to mind is Derek Rose on the Chicago Bulls
[00:42:18.200] [SPEAKER_01]：我能想到的一个例子是芝加哥公牛队的德里克·罗斯。
[00:42:22.940] [SPEAKER_01]: He famously tore his ACL quite early on his career like sort of at or approaching his peak
[00:42:22.940] [SPEAKER_01]：众所周知，他职业生涯早期，大概是在巅峰期或接近巅峰期的时候，就遭遇了前交叉韧带撕裂的重伤。
[00:42:28.740] [SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't necessarily his fault because his coach did not pull him
[00:42:28.740] [SPEAKER_01]：而且这未必是他的错，因为他的教练并没有把他换下。
[00:42:32.800] [SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't supposed to be playing they were sort of up
[00:42:32.800] [SPEAKER_01]：他本来不应该上场的，他们当时有点……
[00:42:36.120] [SPEAKER_01]: Quite big on this game the starters are usually taken out of the game to preserve them and he was still playing
[00:42:36.120] [SPEAKER_01]：这场比赛的关键在于，为了保护首发球员，他们通常会被换下场，但他当时还在场上。
[00:42:42.660] [SPEAKER_01]: Right, and so this was you know
[00:42:42.660] [SPEAKER_01]：对，所以这就是你知道的
[00:42:44.560] [SPEAKER_01]: This sort of actually changed his career significantly because he was never to stay in player afterwards and so
[00:42:44.560] [SPEAKER_01]：这件事实际上极大地改变了他的职业生涯，因为之后他再也没有成为职业球员。
[00:42:49.660] [SPEAKER_01]: He's often considered like one of these great what ifs in basketball and so that's sort of a thing
[00:42:49.660] [SPEAKER_01]：他经常被认为是篮球史上那些令人扼腕的“如果当初……”之一，所以这算是一种现象。
[00:42:54.320] [SPEAKER_01]: Right, it's like oh he did everything he could but he was ultimately thrust in a situation where
[00:42:54.320] [SPEAKER_01]：对，就像他已经尽力了，但最终还是被推入了一个境地，
[00:42:59.240] [SPEAKER_01]: It was unavoidable for him and then he tore his other ACL
[00:42:59.240] [SPEAKER_01]：对他来说这是不可避免的，然后他又撕裂了另一条前交叉韧带。
[00:43:03.640] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, thanks. I feel like injuries usually are pretty unavoidable like you don't really blame anybody for it usually
[00:43:03.640] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，是的，谢谢。我觉得伤病通常是无法避免的，一般情况下你也不会因此责怪任何人。
[00:43:11.180] [SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's like someone who's super open about like not taking care of their body because I know
[00:43:11.180] [SPEAKER_02]：除非是那种毫不掩饰自己不爱惜身体的人，因为我知道
[00:43:17.760] [SPEAKER_02]: In the NFL there are players who eat extremely like poorly for further diet like McDonald's every meal or like only candy
[00:43:17.760] [SPEAKER_02]：在NFL（美国国家橄榄球联盟）中，有些球员饮食习惯极其糟糕，比如每顿饭都吃麦当劳，或者只吃糖果。
[00:43:25.340] [SPEAKER_02]: A lot of players do that and then like kind of brag about it
[00:43:25.340] [SPEAKER_02]：很多球员都这么做，然后还以此为荣。
[00:43:27.620] [SPEAKER_02]: But then when they get hurt people are like okay, well, I mean, I'm not surprised
[00:43:27.620] [SPEAKER_02]：但当他们受伤时，人们就会说，好吧，我的意思是，我并不感到惊讶。
[00:43:31.820] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I think sometimes it's just like freak injuries
[00:43:31.820] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，因为我觉得有时候就是些意外受伤。
[00:43:35.060] [SPEAKER_04]: Especially like non-contact injuries
[00:43:35.060] [SPEAKER_04]：尤其像非接触性损伤。
[00:43:37.600] [SPEAKER_04]: You know like tearing your Achilles that kind of stuff. It's just like really sad when it happens
[00:43:37.600] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，就像跟腱撕裂那种事。发生这种事真的很令人难过。
[00:43:43.160] [SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple football players I've seen where they like
[00:43:43.160] [SPEAKER_01]：我见过几个足球运动员，他们喜欢
[00:43:46.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Injured themselves jet skiing you know in the offseason
[00:43:46.360] [SPEAKER_01]：你知道，他们在休赛期玩水上摩托艇时受伤了。
[00:43:49.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Things right I think it's I think of course like there's there's levels to it where maybe in their contract
[00:43:49.580] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得事情进展顺利，当然，这其中有很多层面，也许在他们的合同里会有相关规定。
[00:43:55.080] [SPEAKER_01]: They're not supposed to be doing certain things. I think like NBA players some of them should have closet saying like you shouldn't be playing
[00:43:55.080] [SPEAKER_01]：他们不应该做某些事。我觉得就像NBA球员一样，有些人应该私下里说“你不应该打球”。
[00:44:01.500] [SPEAKER_01]: You know like pick-up games during the season like I guess on that that point
[00:44:01.500] [SPEAKER_01]：你知道，就像赛季期间的非正式比赛，我想就是这一点。
[00:44:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]: It is sort of like the athletes responsible
[00:44:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]：这有点像运动员的责任
[00:44:06.460] [SPEAKER_01]: Like don't put yourself in situations where you can potentially get injured
[00:44:06.460] [SPEAKER_01]：比如，不要让自己处于可能受伤的境地。
[00:44:11.760] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, there's this like really sad story about this one basketball player John Wall
[00:44:11.760] [SPEAKER_04]：我的天哪，有个篮球运动员约翰·沃尔的故事真的很悲惨。
[00:44:17.300] [SPEAKER_04]: I think it was he tore his
[00:44:17.300] [SPEAKER_04]：我想是他撕裂了他的
[00:44:20.280] [SPEAKER_04]: ACL and then he was like rehabbing at home and then he slipped in the bathtub and tore his Achilles. Oh my god
[00:44:20.280] [SPEAKER_04]：他之前是前交叉韧带撕裂，然后在家做康复训练，结果在浴缸里滑倒，跟腱又撕裂了。我的天哪
[00:44:27.120] [SPEAKER_04]: And everyone was like dude that is just like so unlucky
[00:44:27.120] [SPEAKER_04]：大家都说，老兄，这也太倒霉了吧。
[00:44:33.220] [SPEAKER_01]: Freak accidents and then there was a setback actually where I got infected too
[00:44:33.220] [SPEAKER_01]：先是发生了一些意外，然后又出现了一次挫折，我又被感染了。
[00:44:37.320] [SPEAKER_01]: So it was like it took much longer than expected and then he was no longer in the league
[00:44:37.320] [SPEAKER_01]：所以事情进展比预期的要慢得多，然后他就离开了联盟。
[00:44:43.000] [SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of like an interesting aspect of sports though because
[00:44:43.000] [SPEAKER_05]：这算是体育运动中一个很有趣的方面，因为
[00:44:47.300] [SPEAKER_05]: It might not be someone's full responsibility to avoid injury but I feel like it's almost like a third like a hidden statistic
[00:44:47.300] [SPEAKER_05]：避免受伤或许并非每个人的全部责任，但我感觉这几乎占了三分之一的责任，就像一个隐藏的统计数据。
[00:44:54.140] [SPEAKER_05]: Lebron James. I feel like it's often
[00:44:54.140] [SPEAKER_05]：勒布朗·詹姆斯。我觉得这经常
[00:44:56.460] [SPEAKER_05]: touted for being one of the greatest athletes of all time
[00:44:56.460] [SPEAKER_05]：被誉为有史以来最伟大的运动员之一
[00:44:59.660] [SPEAKER_05]: Partly because he was able to stay injury free for so long which in itself is like a huge feat
[00:44:59.660] [SPEAKER_05]：部分原因是他能够长时间保持健康，没有受伤，这本身就是一项了不起的成就。
[00:45:05.040] [SPEAKER_05]: And then you hear about rookies like Wembenaia who is like
[00:45:05.040] [SPEAKER_05]：然后你就会听到像温贝纳亚这样的新秀的消息，他就像
[00:45:08.960] [SPEAKER_05]: Someone new in the NBA and I feel like people are always like oh yeah, he's so good at
[00:45:08.960] [SPEAKER_05]：NBA新人来了，我觉得大家总是会说，哦，他真厉害
[00:45:13.400] [SPEAKER_05]: Defense but then the caveat is that he has like a huge potential to get injured or something
[00:45:13.400] [SPEAKER_05]：防守能力不错，但需要注意的是，他极有可能受伤或其他什么情况。
[00:45:19.160] [SPEAKER_04]: Right, I feel like it's almost like a statistic honestly. I really is you try to not draft like injury prone people in
[00:45:19.160] [SPEAKER_04]：没错，说实话，我觉得这几乎就像一个统计数据。你真的应该尽量避免选秀时选择那些容易受伤的人。
[00:45:26.800] [SPEAKER_01]: Fannaces I think they look the same right like availability is an ability to and that is true both for like
[00:45:26.800] [SPEAKER_01]：我觉得粉丝们看起来都一样，对吧？可用性是一种能力，这对两者都适用。
[00:45:33.400] [SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy n for real life so Ben Simmons for instance
[00:45:33.400] [SPEAKER_01]：幻想与现实生活，比如本·西蒙斯。
[00:45:37.680] [SPEAKER_01]: Guys play the hundred games in four seasons
[00:45:37.680] [SPEAKER_01]：伙计们在四个赛季里打一百场比赛
[00:45:39.800] [SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's good for them I guess is they still get paid usually if they don't play so like
[00:45:39.800] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得对他们来说有好处的一点是，即使不上场比赛，他们通常也能拿到工资。
[00:45:45.880] [SPEAKER_02]: I know John wall he took like two years to come back but during that period
[00:45:45.880] [SPEAKER_02]：我知道约翰·沃尔，他花了两年时间才复出，但在那段时间里
[00:45:48.740] [SPEAKER_02]: I think he made like 50 or 60 million yeah from this 40 a year. I'm just rehaving to so you know that's crazy
[00:45:48.740] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得他靠这个一年赚了五六千万，对，四千万。我得再说一遍，你知道，这太疯狂了。
[00:45:57.160] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think like that's for you know
[00:45:57.160] [SPEAKER_01]：但我觉得那就像是给你的，你知道的
[00:45:59.540] [SPEAKER_01]: The guarantee like NBA contracts are unique because they're guaranteed if you're like into NFL
[00:45:59.540] [SPEAKER_01]：像NBA合同那样的保障条款是独一无二的，因为如果你像NFL球员一样，它们也能提供保障。
[00:46:04.240] [SPEAKER_01]: It's less guaranteed or if you're playing like individual sports like tennis for instance
[00:46:04.240] [SPEAKER_01]：如果是像网球这样的个人运动，那就不太有保障了。
[00:46:09.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Baritini was out with multiple surgeries and now he's has like a much stronger
[00:46:09.580] [SPEAKER_01]：巴里蒂尼之前做了多次手术，现在他状态好多了，而且更强壮了。
[00:46:14.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Across those are sobbing over here
[00:46:14.360] [SPEAKER_01]：这边有人在哭泣
[00:46:16.840] [SPEAKER_01]: For like these individual sports
[00:46:16.840] [SPEAKER_01]：就像这些个人运动一样
[00:46:19.300] [SPEAKER_01]: The injuries set back so much larger because then it makes the climb back to like relevance or
[00:46:19.300] [SPEAKER_01]：伤病造成的损失更大，因为这会大大增加重返巅峰或恢复到巅峰状态的难度。
[00:46:25.080] [SPEAKER_01]: Back to a place where you know you can compete again much harder because you don't have like that team aspect to support you too
[00:46:25.080] [SPEAKER_01]：回到一个你知道你可以更加努力竞争的地方，因为你没有团队的支持。
[00:46:31.260] [SPEAKER_04]: True and I think in like tennis the main way you make money is by winning you get money per like
[00:46:31.260] [SPEAKER_04]：没错，我觉得像网球这种运动，赚钱的主要方式就是赢球，每赢一场就能拿到奖金。
[00:46:37.280] [SPEAKER_04]: tournament that you compete in
[00:46:37.280] [SPEAKER_04]：你参加的锦标赛
[00:46:39.580] [SPEAKER_01]: They're almost like contractors. So there's there's no a recently that the men's league has implemented like a salary floor now
[00:46:39.580] [SPEAKER_01]：他们几乎就像是合同工。所以，目前还没有像男子联盟最近实施的那种最低工资标准。
[00:46:45.840] [SPEAKER_01]: But it's still not enough to cover like all the travel they do
[00:46:45.840] [SPEAKER_01]：但这仍然不足以支付他们所有的旅行费用。
[00:46:50.060] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like what's interesting about sports is there's almost two different dynamics sometimes with players
[00:46:50.060] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得体育运动的有趣之处在于，运动员之间有时会呈现出几乎两种截然不同的动态。
[00:46:55.320] [SPEAKER_02]: So there's like the star player and then the fringe player who's like barely making the team
[00:46:55.320] [SPEAKER_02]：所以队里既有明星球员，也有勉强能进队的边缘球员。
[00:46:59.540] [SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting to think about how different their worlds are to like the star player probably has never thought about
[00:46:59.540] [SPEAKER_02]：想想他们的世界有多么不同，这很有意思，比如这位明星球员可能从未想过这一点。
[00:47:05.060] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I might get cut from this team or whatever like the fringe player is always thinking like
[00:47:05.060] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，我可能会被球队裁掉什么的，就像边缘球员总是会想的那样。
[00:47:09.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how can I just like stay on the team?
[00:47:09.580] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，我怎样才能留在队里呢？
[00:47:11.780] [SPEAKER_02]: Right, like the star players like oh, I'm waiting for my next 10 million dollars
[00:47:11.780] [SPEAKER_02]：没错，就像那些明星球员一样，哦，我在等我的下一个1000万美元。
[00:47:15.220] [SPEAKER_02]: My next contract or whatever
[00:47:15.220] [SPEAKER_02]：我的下一份合同之类的
[00:47:17.400] [SPEAKER_04]: Do that's so true. I remember there was this one guy on the warriors who was like a fringe player and he was making
[00:47:17.400] [SPEAKER_04]：确实如此。我记得勇士队里有个球员，感觉就像个边缘球员，但他却打出了很高的分数。
[00:47:24.640] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't know it was like a couple hundred k for the year and
[00:47:24.640] [SPEAKER_04]：我不知道，大概一年几十万吧。
[00:47:29.240] [SPEAKER_04]: He was like dude. I can like barely afford housing in the bay because it's so expensive here
[00:47:29.240] [SPEAKER_04]：他当时就说，老兄，我在湾区都快买不起房了，因为这里房价太贵了。
[00:47:33.580] [SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile like Steph Curry dream on green. They're like rolling in cash
[00:47:33.580] [SPEAKER_04]：与此同时，就像斯蒂芬·库里梦想着绿色一样，他们简直富得流油。
[00:47:37.140] [SPEAKER_01]: There was like a joke about that player because they signed these sort of like not really like full NBA contracts and they're like do this guy qualifies for like
[00:47:37.140] [SPEAKER_01]：有个关于那个球员的笑话，因为他们签的合同有点像是非正式的NBA合同，然后人们就问，这家伙到底够不够格？
[00:47:44.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Affordable housing and
[00:47:44.960] [SPEAKER_01]：经济适用房和
[00:47:47.300] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think like the starting quarterback for the Niners
[00:47:47.300] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我觉得就像旧金山49人队的先发四分卫。
[00:47:50.880] [SPEAKER_02]: They came out and said he has like four roommates. Oh my god
[00:47:50.880] [SPEAKER_02]：他们出来告诉我他有四个室友。我的天哪
[00:47:54.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Out in the booties in San Jose because he just can't afford anything
[00:47:54.960] [SPEAKER_02]：他现在在圣何塞穷得叮当响，因为他什么都买不起。
[00:47:58.700] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he could be one of our friends neighbors
[00:47:58.700] [SPEAKER_04]：老兄，他可能是我们朋友的邻居。
[00:48:00.900] [SPEAKER_01]: Just look for a Toyota
[00:48:00.900] [SPEAKER_01]：随便找辆丰田就行了。
[00:48:04.020] [SPEAKER_01]: Was that's even like speaking of the 49ers Christian McAfrey like he's out right now and his replacement
[00:48:04.020] [SPEAKER_01]：这就像在谈论49人队的克里斯蒂安·麦卡弗雷，他现在缺阵，还有他的替代者。
[00:48:10.240] [SPEAKER_01]: Jordan Mason. I think his annual his whole annual salary is like just under a million and that's how much CMC makes per game
[00:48:10.240] [SPEAKER_01]：乔丹·梅森。我觉得他年薪差不多一百万，而CMC每场比赛的收入也差不多是这个数。
[00:48:18.180] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's like yeah talk about like this discrepancy
[00:48:18.180] [SPEAKER_01]：所以，是的，谈谈这种差异吧。
[00:48:23.120] [SPEAKER_04]: So to end off this episode we will do our own little draft of
[00:48:23.120] [SPEAKER_04]：那么，在本期节目的最后，我们将进行我们自己的小草稿……
[00:48:28.640] [SPEAKER_04]: our personal top three best athletes of all time
[00:48:28.640] [SPEAKER_04]：我们个人心目中最伟大的三位运动员
[00:48:33.360] [SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a snake draft which means that
[00:48:33.360] [SPEAKER_04]：我们将采用蛇形草案，这意味着……
[00:48:36.360] [SPEAKER_04]: Gisoo will be first pick and then James will be second. I'll be third
[00:48:36.360] [SPEAKER_04]：Gisoo 将是第一顺位，James 将是第二顺位，我将是第三顺位。
[00:48:40.380] [SPEAKER_04]: Jim and we'll be fourth and then we'll go back around so then Jim and we'll be fifth. I'll be six
[00:48:40.380] [SPEAKER_04]：吉姆，我们排第四，然后我们再绕一圈，吉姆，我们排第五。我排第六。
[00:48:46.560] [SPEAKER_04]: etc. So we'll just do three rounds
[00:48:46.560] [SPEAKER_04]：等等。所以我们就做三轮吧。
[00:48:48.600] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I guess I'm first pick. I feel like this is an easy one. I'm gonna pick lip-ronging. I knew it
[00:48:48.600] [SPEAKER_05]：好吧，看来我是第一个选的。我觉得这题很简单。我要选唇齿音。我就知道。
[00:48:55.970] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm just putting on my criteria. It's like not only could they do well in other sports
[00:48:55.970] [SPEAKER_02]：我只是在陈述我的标准。这就像他们不仅能在其他运动中表现出色一样。
[00:49:01.250] [SPEAKER_02]: But also how much better are they than their peers in their own sports? So I'm going to use sandbolt
[00:49:01.250] [SPEAKER_02]：但他们在各自运动项目中比同龄人强多少呢？所以我打算用沙地闪电。
[00:49:06.650] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what is it? Great one
[00:49:06.650] [SPEAKER_04]：哦，什么事？很棒！
[00:49:08.850] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna choose Michael Jordan. I'm gonna go with no-back joke of it. Okay, go again
[00:49:08.850] [SPEAKER_04]：好的，我选迈克尔·乔丹。我选一个关于他“背身单打”的笑话。好的，再来一次。
[00:49:15.590] [SPEAKER_01]: And then if I were to
[00:49:15.590] [SPEAKER_01]：然后如果我要
[00:49:17.250] [SPEAKER_01]: Consider like James is quite serious. I'll go with another tennis player
[00:49:17.250] [SPEAKER_01]：想想詹姆斯，他挺认真的。我选另一位网球运动员。
[00:49:20.570] [SPEAKER_01]: Gail Momshees
[00:49:20.570] [SPEAKER_01]：盖尔·莫姆希斯
[00:49:23.930] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's great athlete
[00:49:23.930] [SPEAKER_04]：哦，他是个很棒的运动员。
[00:49:25.970] [SPEAKER_01]: For the record just just to preface out there. This is a six four freak of nature
[00:49:25.970] [SPEAKER_01]：首先声明一下，这是个身高六尺四寸的自然奇才。
[00:49:30.790] [SPEAKER_01]: Who said if he wasn't playing professional tennis he'd be in the NBA? Oh, I thought you were gonna say who looks good sure
[00:49:30.790] [SPEAKER_01]：谁说他不打职业网球就一定能进NBA？哦，我还以为你要说谁长得好看呢。
[00:49:37.910] [SPEAKER_01]: Also very true
[00:49:37.910] [SPEAKER_01]：确实如此
[00:49:41.110] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a good one that I think might get overlooked a little bit Wayne Gretzky
[00:49:41.110] [SPEAKER_04]：好的，我有一个不错的例子，我觉得可能会被人忽略，那就是韦恩·格雷茨基。
[00:49:47.230] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a hot-nadian man. I saw hockey
[00:49:47.230] [SPEAKER_01]：那是个帅气的印度男人。我看了冰球比赛
[00:49:49.410] [SPEAKER_04]: He was so good that in fantasy hockey he had to be split into two players
[00:49:49.410] [SPEAKER_04]：他太厉害了，以至于在梦幻冰球游戏中，他的角色不得不拆分成两个球员。
[00:49:54.430] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually I insane every time I read the Wayne Gretzky like stats it was like him and then like huge
[00:49:54.430] [SPEAKER_01]：每次我看韦恩·格雷茨基的数据，都觉得不可思议，他简直太厉害了。
[00:50:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Cazom and the number two
[00:50:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]：卡佐姆和二号
[00:50:01.750] [SPEAKER_02]: Someone said like if you take out all his goals and count as assist as half points
[00:50:01.750] [SPEAKER_02]：有人说，如果把他的所有进球都去掉，只算助攻，得分减半的话。
[00:50:06.450] [SPEAKER_02]: He'd still be the number one score. It's crazy
[00:50:06.450] [SPEAKER_02]：他仍然会是得分第一。太疯狂了。
[00:50:11.030] [SPEAKER_05]: You were gonna pick him
[00:50:11.030] [SPEAKER_05]：你本来打算选他的
[00:50:14.570] [SPEAKER_02]: Sharky now. Oh
[00:50:14.570] [SPEAKER_02]：现在鲨鱼出没了。哦
[00:50:16.930] [SPEAKER_02]: Three of my lungs oh
[00:50:16.930] [SPEAKER_02]：我的三个肺哦
[00:50:19.410] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm gonna pick Anthony Davis because of the vibes
[00:50:19.410] [SPEAKER_05]：好吧，我选安东尼·戴维斯，因为感觉不错。
[00:50:23.050] [SPEAKER_05]: He has good vibes and then I'm gonna pick
[00:50:23.050] [SPEAKER_05]：他感觉不错，然后我就要选他了。
[00:50:26.790] [SPEAKER_05]: All-pick Nick Bosa
[00:50:26.790] [SPEAKER_05]: 全选尼克·博萨
[00:50:29.270] [SPEAKER_05]: This is greatest of all the time. She's so yeah, my greatest of all times this is her mouth rush more
[00:50:29.270] [SPEAKER_05]：这是有史以来最棒的。她太棒了，是的，这是我有史以来最棒的，这是她嘴上说的更多
[00:50:35.550] [SPEAKER_05]: This is not objective
[00:50:35.550] [SPEAKER_05]：这不是客观的
[00:50:38.710] [SPEAKER_02]: This is wild
[00:50:38.710] [SPEAKER_02]：这太疯狂了
[00:50:40.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you think to be a player
[00:50:40.230] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，你觉得自己是个玩家
[00:50:43.530] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyways
[00:50:43.530] [SPEAKER_02]：好的，总之
[00:50:45.310] [SPEAKER_05]: Yes
[00:50:45.310] [SPEAKER_05]：是的
[00:50:46.650] [SPEAKER_02]: Last pick I mean I get it's got to be the guy who's grunt I know
[00:50:46.650] [SPEAKER_02]：最后一个人选，我的意思是，我知道肯定得选那个最能扛事儿的家伙，我认识他。
[00:50:50.770] [SPEAKER_02]: No, no
[00:50:50.770] [SPEAKER_02]：不，不
[00:50:52.810] [SPEAKER_04]: Dang yeah, this is hard now. Oh
[00:50:52.810] [SPEAKER_04]：哎呀，现在这可真难。哦
[00:50:55.610] [SPEAKER_04]: Michael helps
[00:50:55.610] [SPEAKER_04]：迈克尔帮忙
[00:50:58.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I would probably put tiger woods up there. Oh, yeah, I'll take tiger woods to be my third
[00:50:58.390] [SPEAKER_01]：我大概会把泰格·伍兹排在前面。哦，对，我会把泰格·伍兹排在第三。
[00:51:04.370] [SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to say if this was a fantasy
[00:51:04.370] [SPEAKER_04]：我得说，这是否只是一场幻想
[00:51:07.110] [SPEAKER_04]: Then G-su would have lost
[00:51:07.110] [SPEAKER_04]：那样的话，G-su 就输了。
[00:51:09.090] [SPEAKER_02]: Not good. Yeah, I think driven and Jesus thing was pretty close
[00:51:09.090] [SPEAKER_02]：不太好。嗯，我觉得“驱动力”和“耶稣”那段挺接近的。
[00:51:12.610] [SPEAKER_02]: G-somon B
[00:51:12.610] [SPEAKER_02]: G-somon B
[00:51:14.310] [SPEAKER_02]: Uh
[00:51:14.310] [SPEAKER_02]：呃
[00:51:16.490] [SPEAKER_02]: Who is your first pick no batch? You okay, okay, that's that lines up with LeBron I think I just think it's hard for me to drop people
[00:51:16.490] [SPEAKER_02]：你第一轮选秀会选谁？你觉得怎么样？好吧，我觉得应该选勒布朗，我只是觉得我很难放弃别人。
[00:51:23.950] [SPEAKER_05]: That I like don't give a shit about okay. I don't really care about Michael falls
[00:51:23.950] [SPEAKER_05]：我喜欢的那些事我根本不在乎，好吗？我真的不在乎迈克尔摔倒的事。
[00:51:27.410] [SPEAKER_05]: But I know that guy's a gray athlete. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, that was fun
[00:51:27.410] [SPEAKER_05]：但我知道那家伙是个老练的运动员。你明白我的意思吗？嗯。好吧，那挺有意思的。
[00:51:31.950] [SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad we got to sit down and delve into our our new hobby scores
[00:51:31.950] [SPEAKER_04]：我很高兴我们能坐下来深入探讨我们新的爱好分数。
[00:51:38.950] [SPEAKER_04]: Yay, I love it. I'm so I'm fine
