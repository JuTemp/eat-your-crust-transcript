[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Kaila. We are super excited for today's episode and our guest today is someone who many of you may recognize. She is the author of the memoir Fetishized, which is soon to be out as of this episode,
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal，我是Kaila。我们非常兴奋地推出今天的节目，今天的嘉宾是一位大家可能都认识的人。她是回忆录《Fetishized》的作者，这本书在本期节目播出时即将出版。
[00:00:28.190] and the former lead singer of the all Asian American female rock band Nylon Pink. And she's also a former import model and amongst that many other things as well. So welcome Kaila Yu. Hi, thanks for having me. Yeah, of course. We're so excited to have you on. And as related to your book coming out, we really wanted to focus this episode on talking about the hypersexualization of Asian women and,
[00:00:28.190] 她曾是全亚裔美国女子摇滚乐队 Nylon Pink 的主唱，也曾是一名模特，除此之外，她还有很多其他身份。欢迎 Kaila Yu。你好，谢谢邀请。当然，我们非常高兴你能来。关于你即将出版的新书，我们想在本期节目中重点讨论一下亚裔女性的过度性化问题，以及……
[00:00:55.730] you know, all of the complications and like fetishization that comes with that, since you cover a lot of that in your memoir. So to start us off, just a quick question. What did the hypersexualization of Asian women in media look like when you were growing up? Yeah, so when I was in elementary school, there was no real Asian. I can't even remember anything.
[00:00:55.730] 你知道，随之而来的各种复杂情况，比如物化之类的，你在回忆录里也写了很多。那么，首先问个简单的问题。在你成长的过程中，媒体对亚裔女性的过度性化是什么样的？嗯，我上小学的时候，根本没有真正的亚裔形象。我什么都记不起来了。
[00:01:23.850] Yeah, so it was, I think, more into when I was like in high school, and that's around when Lucy Liu came out more in college. And then Joy Luck Club, I think, came out during high school. And I think the most fetishy thing I first saw was probably Memoirs of a Geisha. That was like a mainstream thing. And I remember when the book first came out, I was so excited because there was only Joy Luck Club. That was the only Asian American book at the time. And then Memoirs of a Geisha was like
[00:01:23.850] 对，我觉得，大概是在我高中那会儿，那时候刘玉玲在大学里开始走红。然后《喜福会》好像也是在我高中那会儿出版的。我觉得我最早接触的比较有恋物癖的作品可能是《艺伎回忆录》。那算是主流作品了。我记得这本书刚出版的时候，我特别兴奋，因为当时只有《喜福会》。那是当时唯一一本亚裔美国人写的书。然后《艺伎回忆录》……
[00:01:53.330] another Asian book. But I don't know if I paid attention to it at the time, but it was written by a white guy. It's fictional, but written as if it were a true story coming from the Geisha's account. And the book is beautifully written. Like it's a great story and the descriptions and you really, I got lost in it. I read it a bunch of times. And then the movie came out and the movie was so
[00:01:53.330] 另一本亚洲小说。但我当时可能没太注意，它是一位白人写的。虽然是虚构的，但写得好像是艺伎的真实故事。这本书文笔优美，故事精彩，描写生动，我完全沉浸其中，读了好几遍。后来电影上映了，电影也……
[00:02:17.910] like, you know, millions of millions of dollars, like a big, big production film. And it was gorgeous. I think that was the first very, very mainstream portrayal of Asian women as kind of submissive and only existing for men in that scenario. Yeah, I remember reading that bit in your book where you talk about like, oh, these are all the problematic things in that book that a lot of people don't realize, even though it's so famous and like so widely regarded as like a beautiful novel. And I was
[00:02:17.910] 你知道，就像那种耗资数百万美元的大制作电影。而且画面非常华丽。我认为那是第一部非常主流地将亚洲女性刻画成顺从、存在的唯一意义就是服务于男性的形象。是的，我记得在你的书中读到过，你提到这本书里有很多问题，很多人并没有意识到，尽管它非常有名，也被广泛认为是一部优美的长篇小说。
[00:02:47.810] like, yeah, I read this when I was really young. Like, I think I read it in like middle school or something. And I also thought it was true. Like, I didn't realize how problematic it was. And then reading your book, I was like, this is an example of how many things that maybe we internalize or just like accept as true and are so okay with. And then in hindsight, we realize, wait, this is damaging for us as Asian women or just how other people or other ethnic groups might see us in the culture as well.
[00:02:47.810] 是啊，我小时候就读过这本书。大概是初中左右吧。当时我也觉得书里说的是真的。我根本没意识到它有多成问题。后来读了你的书，我才明白，原来我们有很多事情都内化了，或者说我们习以为常地接受了，觉得没什么大不了的。但事后回想起来，我们才意识到，等等，这对我们亚裔女性来说是有害的，也会影响其他族裔群体看待我们的方式。
[00:03:16.230] And it's so problematic. I mean, it wouldn't work today. But it's like, first of all, it's child prostitution, right? I think in the movie, she you know, she's sold off or whatever. She's like, I don't remember the exact age, but it's like 12, 13, 14. And then she gets into the geisha house and they sell off her virginity, I'm pretty sure at a very young age. By the way, like real geisha, always say this is not a
[00:03:16.230] 这太成问题了。我的意思是，现在肯定行不通。首先，这是儿童卖淫，对吧？我觉得电影里，她被卖了之类的。我记不清她具体多大了，大概12、13、14岁吧。然后她进了艺伎馆，她们把她的初夜卖了，我敢肯定她年纪很小。顺便说一句，就像真正的艺伎一样，她们总是说这不是……
[00:03:43.390] practice. In this film, and in the book, it was a formal like, like everybody was in on it. Everybody knows that this is what you do when geisha turn of age. So that's kind of crazy that it made it into like an institutionalized practice. Yeah. And then I feel like that just really created this false piece of information that we ran with in the media. Yeah, when I also read that part in the book, I was like, Oh, I actually did not know this. And now I'm
[00:03:43.390] 惯例。在这部电影和原著里，这都是一种正式的仪式，好像每个人都心照不宣。每个人都知道艺伎成年时要做什么。所以，它竟然变成了一种制度化的惯例，这真是太疯狂了。是啊。然后我觉得这真的造成了一种错误信息，而媒体却对此大肆报道。是啊，当我读到书中的那部分时，我就想，哦，我竟然不知道这件事。现在我
[00:04:11.650] realizing where the origin of this like misinformation was coming from. I totally thought the same thing as what the book described. And it was probably because everyone took this book as truth, when it's fiction, and it's like people have verified that it's false information. Yeah, and it was a mega bestseller, like millions and millions of copies. So this is the first time white people are reading about Asian women, probably because what other book are they reading,
[00:04:11.650] 意识到这种错误信息的源头在哪里。我的想法和书中描述的完全一样。这大概是因为大家都把这本书当真了，尽管它是虚构的，而且现在看来，人们已经证实它是虚假信息。是啊，它可是超级畅销书，销量数百万册。所以，这可能是白人第一次读到关于亚裔女性的书，大概是因为他们除了读亚裔女性的书之外，还能读什么书呢？
[00:04:39.270] except maybe Joy Luck Club. I think that was more popular in the Asian community. This is their first introduction to what East Asian women are like. Right. And I feel like you see in the news nowadays, I think they had to shut down one of the streets in Japan or something because tourists were going and like attacking geisha or like following them or touch them. Yeah. And I don't know if it was like a temporary thing. But I know that
[00:04:39.270] 或许除了《喜福会》之外。我觉得那部电影在亚洲观众中更受欢迎。这是他们第一次接触到东亚女性的形象。没错。而且我觉得就像现在新闻里报道的那样，好像日本某条街因为游客骚扰艺伎，比如攻击她们、跟踪她们、甚至触摸她们，而被封锁了。是啊。我不知道这是否只是暂时的。但我知道……
[00:05:04.350] there's been a lot of instances where people go to Japan with this like image of geisha and like their role in their head that's falsified. And then they enact stuff in real like that's super scary that, you know, pieces of media that we read and consume have this trickle effect onto like innocent populations of people who they're like, wait, this is not the reality that I live in. So I think a lot of your book points that like trickle effect or like the butterfly effect of
[00:05:04.350] 有很多例子表明，人们带着对艺伎的刻板印象和错误的认知去日本，然后把这些刻板印象运用到现实生活中。这非常可怕，因为我们阅读和消费的媒体内容会产生连锁反应，影响到无辜的人群，让他们意识到“等等，这根本不是我生活的现实”。所以我认为你的书中很多内容都提到了这种连锁反应，或者说蝴蝶效应。
[00:05:30.690] things so beautifully and like well done. Yeah, it's just like on the offset, a lot of people who are not Asian women are like, oh, it's just a compliment. You know, why are you so pissed off? Like what's the harm? But it can lead to violence and real world circumstances. And it has in many instances. So that's why it's problematic. And the origins are in blood and war. So for sure. And I
[00:05:30.690] 事情做得这么美好，这么棒。是啊，一开始，很多非亚裔女性会觉得，哦，这只是句恭维话。你知道，你干嘛这么生气？这有什么害处？但它会导致暴力和现实世界的种种问题。而且在很多情况下确实如此。所以这就是问题所在。而它的根源在于鲜血和战争。所以，当然。而且我
[00:05:54.950] think like there was also a part that you pointed out that I really, I guess, like resonated with where you mentioned earlier in media, you know, when there wasn't much Asian American presence, sometimes Asian characters would just be thrown in as like a casual, sexualized background character, or even just like a comedic relief if it was a man. And I recently watched Happy Gilmore,
[00:05:54.950] 我觉得你刚才提到的一点我特别有共鸣，就是你在媒体上提到的，在亚裔美国人很少出现在荧幕上的时候，亚裔角色有时会被当作无关紧要的、带有性暗示的背景人物，或者如果是男性角色，就只是用来搞笑的。我最近看了《球场古惑仔》（Happy Gilmore），
[00:06:21.070] which came out, you know, back in I think it was like the 2000s. And there were no Asian characters in it except for in the beginning of the movie. Happy, the main character, he's like breaking up with his girlfriend. And then he is like trying to beg her to come back over the apartment intercom. And then some random old Asian lady walks by and she hears this and then she ends up going up
[00:06:21.070] 这部电影大概是2000年代上映的。除了开头，里面没有一个亚裔角色。主角Happy和女朋友分手了，他通过公寓的对讲机苦苦哀求她回来。这时，一位素不相识的亚裔老太太路过，听到了对讲机的呼叫，然后就走了过来。
[00:06:47.330] and then they insinuate that they have sex. And then she never appears again. And I was like, that is true. What? I don't even know this reference. I have to go watch this. I don't even know about this one. This is a very strong example. Yeah, it was crazy because I watched it after reading your book, right? So I was like more hypervigilant about this, especially since like an old movie. And I was like, dude, this is what Kyle is talking about. Like it's right there in front of our eyes.
[00:06:47.330] 然后他们暗示他们发生了性关系。之后她就再也没出现过。我当时就想，这倒是真的。什么？我根本不知道这个梗。我得去看看。我对这个完全不了解。这真是个绝佳的例子。是啊，太巧了，因为我是在读完你的书之后才看的这部电影，对吧？所以我对这方面格外警惕，尤其这是一部老电影。然后我就想，老兄，这就是凯尔说的。它就摆在我们眼前。
[00:07:12.990] This one was a very big movie. Yeah. It probably happened so casually because it happened in like Sex and the City 2. Like I forgot whose character. I think it was Samantha had this rich boyfriend, probably butchering who the characters are. But he had a maid who was Asian. And the maid was like really jealous of Samantha because she was in love with and trying to like have sex with the rich guy
[00:07:12.990] 这部电影当时很火。是啊。它之所以发生得这么随意，可能是因为它出现在《欲望都市2》里。我忘了是谁的角色了。我记得好像是萨曼莎有个有钱的男朋友，我可能记错角色了。他有个亚裔女佣。那个女佣特别嫉妒萨曼莎，因为萨曼莎爱上了那个有钱人，还想和他上床。
[00:07:39.830] or whatever. And that was the only purpose of her character. I mean, there's so many throwaway references, I guess. I feel like there's been so many evolutions of how Asian characters are in the media. I think last year or two years ago, I watched the show Never Have I Ever. And the main character is this like beautifully complex, kind of like a strong and like willful Indian teenager. And I was like, dude, we would not have grown up seeing a show like this. When we were young,
[00:07:39.830] 或者别的什么。而这大概就是她这个角色存在的唯一意义。我的意思是，里面有很多无关紧要的暗示，我觉得。我觉得媒体中亚裔角色的形象已经发生了很大的变化。我记得一两年前，我看过《好想做一次》（Never Have I Ever）这部剧。主角是一个非常复杂、坚强又任性的印度裔青少年。当时我就想，天哪，我们小时候根本看不到这样的剧。
[00:08:08.590] Crystal and I always talk about how we felt very lucky to see like London Tipton. And that was like peak representation for us. And we were just like so happy with that. And now we get so many more like full bodied and complex Asian characters. And the amount of Asian writers out there like writing fiction books about Asian characters, it's just it's vast actually. Totally. Totally. But sometimes I do wonder, I'm like, what is the problematic thing that we don't
[00:08:08.590] 我和克丽丝塔尔总是聊起我们有多幸运能看到像伦敦·蒂普顿这样的人物。对我们来说，这就像是亚裔形象塑造的巅峰。我们为此感到无比欣慰。现在，我们看到了更多丰满而复杂的亚裔角色。而且，创作亚裔题材小说的亚裔作家数量也相当庞大。真的，真的。但有时候我会想，我们究竟缺少什么？
[00:08:38.530] see right now that like 20 years later, our kids will be like, Mom, you watch this, this is so problematic. Or point things out. And we're like, damn, it felt so normal back then. It's good to question at the time, because then you could like possibly catch it. I still just think we're really hard on women. There's, you know, men doing terrible things like rape and murder. And then
[00:08:38.530] 现在想想，大概20年后，我们的孩子会说：“妈妈，你看这个，这太有问题了。”或者指出一些问题。而我们则会想：“天哪，当时感觉一切都那么正常。” 当时提出质疑是好事，因为那样或许就能发现问题所在。我仍然觉得我们对女性太苛刻了。你知道，有些男人也会做强奸、谋杀之类的可怕事情。
[00:09:03.590] we're like piling on Katy Perry for just being kind of awkward or whatever, you know, like being what they call cringe, like piling on her articles and articles. And I just don't see that happening with a man doing something cringy, you know? That's so true. When we step back and like look at the broader picture, you can really see a lot of not only the effects of the ethnic lens, but also just being a woman is still, yeah, like, I think there
[00:09:03.590] 我们就像是在围攻凯蒂·佩里，就因为她有点尴尬什么的，你知道，就是那种所谓的“令人尴尬”的行为，就像铺天盖地的文章都在批评她。但我感觉如果换成男人做了什么尴尬的事，就不会发生这种事了，你知道吗？确实如此。当我们退后一步，从更广阔的视角来看，你会发现这不仅受到种族视角的影响，而且身为女性本身也仍然……嗯，我觉得……
[00:09:33.290] was this one thing where we kind of noticed women will sometimes get really popular in media, and then they have big upswing. And then suddenly, someone decides to turn on them. Everybody, yeah. That's when their like downfall happens. And it was really interesting, because I read an article where someone was describing this, and they mentioned how Pedro Pascal is experiencing that kind of right
[00:09:33.290] 我们注意到，有些女性在媒体上会突然爆红，人气飙升。然后突然之间，有人开始攻击她们。没错，就是所有人。这就是她们的陨落之时。这真的很有意思，因为我读过一篇文章，里面有人描述了这种情况，还提到佩德罗·帕斯卡就经历了类似的遭遇。
[00:09:58.250] now. And they're like, it's very interesting, because this is usually the kind of thing you see happen to women and not men. But like, he has been having a little bit of controversy lately. So then the person was drawing a little bit of a parallel there. And I was like, that is interesting, because Pedro Pascal is like loved by many, and like very popular with women as well, or like women fans and stuff. So yeah, because that's never happened, I guess, to many major actors that you could think of.
[00:09:58.250] 现在。他们说，这很有意思，因为这种事通常发生在女性身上，而不是男性身上。但是，他最近确实遇到了一些争议。所以那个人就把这两件事做了个类比。我觉得这很有意思，因为佩德罗·帕斯卡很受很多人喜爱，也很受女性欢迎，或者说有很多女性粉丝。所以，是的，因为我想，这种情况在你能想到的很多一线演员身上都没发生过。
[00:10:27.210] What also really disturbed me is like the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard thing. I'm not an expert on this case. I'm not somebody who watched the whole thing. But I know she was a victim, even if she perpetuated some things, they both probably did some stuff. But she got eviscerated. And he was celebrated still by many. So it's kind of like, well, he did some terrible things. Factually, they are documented. So
[00:10:27.210] 真正让我感到不安的是约翰尼·德普和艾梅柏·希尔德的事。我不是这案子的专家，也没看过全程。但我知道她是受害者，即便她也做过一些事，他们俩可能都做了些什么。但她遭到了铺天盖地的指责，而他却仍然受到许多人的追捧。所以感觉就像，他确实做了一些可怕的事情，而且这些事都有据可查。
[00:10:56.410] I know, it's like scary sometimes. And I think oftentimes, what I see online comes in like the form of humor. So it's like, I'll be reading a TikTok comment or something. And then someone will casually make a joke about how Tory Lanez shot at Meg Thee Stallion, or like make a Chris Brown joke. And at first, it could be like kind of funny. And then you realize, wait, this is crazy that we're just so okay with people, I guess, doing violence on women. And it's something that we joke about.
[00:10:56.410] 我知道，有时候确实挺吓人的。而且我觉得，我在网上看到的很多东西都是以幽默的形式呈现的。比如，我可能在看TikTok上的评论，然后有人会随口拿Tory Lanez枪击Megan Thee Stallion开玩笑，或者拿Chris Brown开个玩笑。一开始，可能觉得还挺搞笑的。但后来你会意识到，等等，这太疯狂了，我们居然对有人对女性施暴这件事这么习以为常，而且还拿来开玩笑。
[00:11:26.410] And I think a lot of this stuff can be paralleled in like Asian society too. In K-pop, for example, I know a few years back, there was this girl group member named Seulhyun who was really famous. And she was almost at like the peak of her career. And then she got into this dating scandal with this rapper and paparazzi had taken some photos of her like sprinting from her car to his apartment.
[00:11:26.410] 我觉得很多类似的事情在亚洲社会也能找到相似之处。比如在韩国流行音乐圈，几年前有个叫瑟炫的女团成员非常红，几乎达到了事业的巅峰。后来她和一位说唱歌手传出绯闻，狗仔队拍到她从车里飞奔到他公寓的照片。
[00:11:51.150] And it was like the running photos became like a huge meme in Korea. And that's the one thing that she did or like one of the only things that she did that got her canceled. For like dating a guy that is her age. Like what? That's so crazy. Like God forbid a beautiful woman wants to date another like good looking man, right? Yeah. It's absurd the like not allowing them to date thing. Yeah, that's so toxic, you know?
[00:11:51.150] 然后，那些跑步照片在韩国就成了热门梗。而这几乎是她被“取消关注”的唯一原因，或者说是她为数不多的几件事之一。就因为她和一个同龄男生约会。什么？这太荒谬了。难道一个漂亮女人想和另一个帅哥约会就不行吗？是啊。不允许他们约会简直太荒唐了。是啊，这太毒瘤了，你知道吗？
[00:12:19.110] I guess it's like, not only is it the fans, a lot of the times are like, oh, like, they're so obsessed with like the idol or whatever. And they're like, I don't want you to date anyone because in my mind, you're somehow my, you know, whatever. But then I feel like the companies behind it also help support that kind of narrative. Don't date anyone. Don't cause any scandals. Like, why is this even a scandal that you're dating someone?
[00:12:19.110] 我觉得，很多时候不仅是粉丝，他们对偶像之类的东西太痴迷了。他们会说，我不想让你和任何人谈恋爱，因为在他们心里，你就是我的……你知道的……之类的。但我觉得背后的公司也在助长这种论调。别谈恋爱。别惹丑闻。就好像，谈恋爱这有什么好大惊小怪的？
[00:12:46.550] I feel like weren't there a bunch of guy K-pop stars that were like involved in a rape sex ring or something? So this is so minor. I mean, it's not even a thing. It's not even minor because it's not a thing to be a young woman who dates. I guess that's like another example. To be fair, the main people part of that like whole like sex ring scandal did get punished. But I think there were
[00:12:46.550] 我觉得之前不是有很多韩国男明星卷入过强奸性侵团伙之类的丑闻吗？所以这件事根本算不上什么大事。我的意思是，这根本就不是什么大事。甚至说它小事都不算小事，因为年轻女性谈恋爱本来就不是什么稀奇事。我觉得这算是另一个例子吧。公平地说，之前那个性侵团伙丑闻的主要涉案人员确实受到了惩罚。但我认为……
[00:13:11.610] like some people who are on the sidelines or like minorly connected to it and they're just still walking around and like still having their jobs and all of that. It's a structural issue. I think we're structurally a patriarchy that puts women beneath men. I'm gonna circle us back to your book, Kyla, and one of the major themes that you touch upon during
[00:13:11.610] 就像有些人置身事外，或者只是略有牵连，他们依然照常生活，依然有工作等等。这是一个结构性问题。我认为我们的结构是一个父权制社会，将女性置于男性之下。凯拉，我想回到你的书，以及你在书中探讨的一个主要主题……
[00:13:36.170] the book, which is how Asian women were really objectified and still are to this day and how that objectification was interweaved with like your growth as a person and also just how you view your own identity as an Asian American woman. And I think one of the things that you kind of explore in the beginning was very interesting to me, which is like, do you lean into the fetishization?
[00:13:36.170] 这本书讲述了亚裔女性过去是如何被物化的，以及这种物化现象至今仍然存在，并探讨了这种物化如何与你的个人成长以及你如何看待自己作为亚裔美国女性的身份交织在一起。我认为你在书的开头探讨的一个问题非常有趣，那就是，你会倾向于这种物化吗？
[00:14:00.390] Because it's so pervasive. So why not lean into it and make a career out of it or like build productive things and benefit from it versus other people that you might have had in your life were rejecting it or trying to like fight it or shy away from it. So I guess how do you feel looking back on like the leaning in versus rejecting it? Like, do you feel that it helped you gain some control over your life of something that was harmful, but you were still able to make it constructive? Or do you feel
[00:14:00.390] 因为它无处不在。所以为什么不顺应它，把它发展成事业，或者创造一些有意义的东西，从中受益呢？而不是像你生命中其他人那样，拒绝它、试图对抗它、或者躲避它。所以我想，回首过去，你对顺应它和拒绝它有什么感受？你觉得它是否帮助你掌控了生活中一些有害的因素，但你仍然能够将其转化为建设性的？或者你觉得
[00:14:29.950] like it maybe harmed your self identity or anything in any way? I think it's definitely both. And as I mentioned, like in elementary school, junior high, there was no Asian presence in the mainstream media. But when the internet kind of started during high school, there was one Asian woman who was really huge. And her name was Sunghee Lee. She was a Korean Playboy model. I just remember getting the flyer
[00:14:29.950] 比如，它可能以某种方式损害了你的自我认同或其他方面？我觉得肯定两者都有。就像我之前提到的，在小学、初中，主流媒体上几乎没有亚裔的身影。但到了高中，互联网开始普及的时候，出现了一位非常有名的亚裔女性。她叫李成熙（Sunghee Lee），是韩国版的《花花公子》模特。我还记得收到过她的传单。
[00:14:56.130] from my guy friend and the guys just like went crazy over her. She was the only Asian woman that you could go crazy over. I mean, unless you're like looking overseas to Asia or something and K-pop and like East Asian culture wasn't as big as it is here in America at the time. So I just really latched on to the Sunghee Lee and just wanted to be like her. And I was so nerdy in high school, never got asked to a
[00:14:56.130] 我一个男性朋友跟其他男生都说她特别迷她。她是唯一一个能让男生为之疯狂的亚洲女性。我的意思是，除非你把目光投向海外的亚洲，或者像当时的韩国流行文化和东亚文化在美国不像现在这么流行。所以我特别崇拜李成熙，想成为像她那样的人。我高中时是个十足的书呆子，从来没人邀请我去参加……
[00:15:23.030] dance and like just never had a boyfriend, whatever. So I felt very invisible to boys. To her, she seems like she has the world at her feet was what was in my mind. She was like on the cover of Playboy or whatever. So from a very young age, I was like, oh, I want to be like her. Then I started to follow her website and just followed everything she did. And she was working a lot. So throughout the years,
[00:15:23.030] 跳舞，而且从来没交过男朋友什么的。所以我觉得自己在男生眼里就像个隐形人。在我看来，她好像拥有全世界。她好像上过《花花公子》之类的杂志封面。所以从小我就想，哦，我想成为她那样的人。然后我开始关注她的网站，关注她的一举一动。她工作非常努力。所以这些年来，
[00:15:49.010] I got very normalized to like, oh, she looks like so beautiful and Playboy and all these things. I just want to be everything like her. So by the time I got into college, I already had that in my head, like, oh, maybe I want to pursue this one day. And then I still hadn't really encountered the Asian fetish because nobody had it while I was growing up, I guess. And then I started only hanging around with
[00:15:49.010] 我渐渐习惯了那种感觉，比如，哦，她看起来真漂亮，还上了《花花公子》之类的杂志。我只想成为像她那样的人。所以到了大学，我脑子里就已经有了这种想法，比如，哦，也许有一天我想从事这方面的工作。而且，我之前并没有真正接触过亚洲女性恋物癖，我想是因为在我成长的过程中，没有人有这种倾向。然后，我开始只和……混在一起。
[00:16:15.230] Asians when I was a sophomore or junior. So then obviously, we weren't going to encounter it amongst ourselves. Yeah, it was only during college that I started to hear it was a thing. And then at first, at first, when you're completely invisible, and you hear that there are men who like women like you, you're like, oh, that's great. You know, that's better to me than being invisible at the time.
[00:16:15.230] 我读大二或大三的时候，亚裔群体里就很少有人关注这种现象了。所以很显然，我们彼此之间不会遇到这种情况。是的，直到大学我才开始听说这种事。一开始，当你完全被忽视的时候，听说有男人喜欢像你这样的女人，你会觉得，哦，那太好了。你知道，这总比当时被忽视要好得多。
[00:16:40.010] Mm hmm. So leaning into it, I think, also, this was during a time, and I quote this book called feminist chauvinist pigs. And it's by Ariel Levy. And she talks about how the early 2000s were like raunch culture, where pornography was first hitting the internet. So the mainstream media became very pornified. You see like the girls start to have implants and like they have a certain look,
[00:16:40.010] 嗯哼。所以，顺着这个话题，我觉得，这也发生在一个时期，我引用一本叫《女权沙文主义猪》的书，作者是艾瑞尔·莱维。她谈到2000年代初期的低俗文化，色情内容首次涌入互联网。因此，主流媒体变得非常色情化。你会看到，女孩们开始隆胸，她们的外貌也变得千篇一律，
[00:17:08.510] you know, that they didn't have the decade before the ticket before I think was like Kate Moss or something, but it changed into something else. The girls next door was on TV, the Playboy show where it's like just normalized this old dude with his three young girlfriends. And everyone was like, Oh, this is so cute. What a fun show. So it was like a very sexualized time. And it's also post feminism, where women
[00:17:08.510] 你知道，在十年前，好像是凯特·莫斯之类的明星走红，但后来就变了。《邻家女孩》在电视上播出，还有《花花公子》的真人秀，把一个老男人和他的三个年轻女友的形象正常化了。大家都觉得，哦，这太可爱了。多么有趣的节目啊。所以那是一个性观念非常开放的时代。而且现在也到了后女权主义时代，女性……
[00:17:36.330] were thinking, Oh, we're feminist, we can do whatever we want, including be sexy and be like, have as much sex as we want. So we thought it was empowering was kind of the message that was coming through, which was, you know, definitely, I think in the end, just getting tricked by the patriarchy. But like, at the time, that's what a lot of people were thinking. That was kind of the messaging during their time. Leaning into it just seemed like, Oh, I'm just like doing what people do,
[00:17:36.330] 我们当时想，哦，我们是女权主义者，我们可以做任何想做的事，包括性感，想做多少次爱就做多少次。所以我们觉得这很能赋予女性力量，这大概就是当时传递的信息，但你知道，我觉得最终我们还是被父权制蒙蔽了。但当时，很多人都是这么想的。这就是他们那个时代的主流观念。顺应这种观念就好像在说，哦，我只是在做别人都在做的事。
[00:18:04.770] you know, what young women do, we're empowered in our sexuality. That's a really interesting point. And it kind of reminds me of how I thought American Pie was a normal movie and everyone at school was talking about it. So I had my mom download it. And I was like, Oh, let's just like watch it over dinner. So we were eating dinner. Had you seen it before? No, I had no idea. I thought it was like, a regular movie, like the,
[00:18:04.770] 你知道，年轻女性的性观念很开放，这很有意思。这让我想起我以前觉得《美国派》是一部很普通的电影，但学校里每个人都在讨论它。所以我让妈妈下载了这部电影。然后我就想，不如我们边吃晚饭边看吧。于是我们就一边吃晚饭一边看。你之前看过吗？没有，我完全不知道。我以为它就是一部普通的电影，就像……
[00:18:34.290] the title itself seems so innocent, right? Like that is a very sexualized movie for high school kids to be acting out and watching, I guess, because I think I watched it when I was already in college. Perhaps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What happened? Yeah. So I was like, Okay, like, let's watch it while we eat dinner. And then we pull it up. And I think not even like five minutes in, there's just like very graphic, like sex scenes and a lot of
[00:18:34.290] 光看片名就觉得很纯洁，对吧？感觉就像是那种很露骨的、适合高中生看的电影，因为我记得我上大学的时候看过。也许吧。对。对。对。怎么回事？对。我就想，好吧，咱们边吃晚饭边看吧。然后我们就打开了。结果不到五分钟，就出现了非常露骨的性爱场景，还有很多……
[00:19:01.870] dirty jokes. I like slammed the laptop shut. And I was like, Sorry, I don't think I knew what this movie was. But you totally reminded me that that was that kind of era. Like this was so normal. Yeah. And Paris Hilton was like the main icon. We were wearing our jeans to the pubic bone, basically. And like we were talking about Britney Spears virginity, like it was okay to talk about
[00:19:01.870] 荤段子。我当时就砰地一声合上了笔记本电脑。然后我说，抱歉，我好像不知道这部电影是什么。但你一下子就让我意识到，那确实是个年代。感觉那时候这一切都很正常。是啊。帕丽斯·希尔顿简直就是当时的偶像。我们基本上都把牛仔裤穿到耻骨的位置。我们甚至还在讨论布兰妮·斯皮尔斯的处女之身，好像谈论这个话题没什么不妥似的。
[00:19:26.010] that respectable newscasters would ask her about her state of her virginity. So it's very sexualized. Yeah, for sure. And I feel like at that time, for some reason, like just sex was like funny too. Like all the comedies were super raunchy too. And it was like, yeah, like funny that people were, I don't know, sexy or like trying to be sexy and like throwing themselves at boys. And thinking back, it was such a
[00:19:26.010] 那些体面的新闻主播居然会问她是不是处女。所以这非常性化。没错，确实如此。而且我觉得那时候，不知为何，性本身也很有趣。好像所有的喜剧都非常低俗。感觉就像，嗯，人们表现得很性感，或者说努力表现性感，还主动勾引男生，这本身就很有趣。现在回想起来，那真是……
[00:19:54.110] wild time to have grown up in. Like this is the media that we grew up with. And we were like learning from. There are so many sex tapes at the time, right? There was the Pamela Anderson first, and then the Paris Hilton one, and then the Kim Kardashian one. And then later you find out that the two like, you know, Pamela Anderson's legitimately evicted. I love her arc right now. She's like starring in the
[00:19:54.110] 能在那段时间长大真是太疯狂了。我们就是在那类媒体环境下长大的，从中学习。那时候性爱录像带真是层出不穷，对吧？先是帕梅拉·安德森的，然后是帕丽斯·希尔顿的，接着是金·卡戴珊的。后来你才知道，帕梅拉·安德森和帕丽斯·希尔顿都被正式驱逐了。我喜欢她现在的处境。她现在就像是……
[00:20:20.590] naked gun. And it's so amazing. But like, she was a huge star. And this got stolen, like this personal video with her and her boyfriend. Basically in court, they said, well, you model for Playboys. So why? Why is this not okay out there? That was pretty much like what happened. And that kind of ruined her career. She never recovered from that. Also Paris Hilton, she was dating like a decade older man who was
[00:20:20.590] 《裸枪》。这太不可思议了。她当时可是个大明星。结果这段她和男友的私人录像被偷了。法庭上，他们说，你给《花花公子》当模特，那为什么？为什么这段录像就不能公开？事情大概就是这样。这几乎毁了她的事业。她再也没能从中恢复过来。还有帕丽斯·希尔顿，她当时和一个比她大十岁的男人交往。
[00:20:49.350] grooming her basically. Both of these sex tapes that we thought, oh, everybody was watching them, like it was no big deal. And find out the women are all victims in it. Yeah, it's kind of a crazy time. I know a couple years ago, or maybe it's been longer now. Pornhub did like a full sweep of a lot of videos off their site. And a lot of things that were like unverified got deleted and whatnot. And
[00:20:49.350] 基本上就是在诱导她。我们当时觉得，哦，大家都在看这两段性爱录像，没什么大不了的。结果发现里面的女人都是受害者。是啊，现在真是太疯狂了。我知道几年前，或者更久以前，Pornhub 对网站上的很多视频进行了一次彻底的清理。很多未经证实的视频都被删除了。
[00:21:14.650] it's a necessary change. I think that was like super impactful. But it's also like, why was that not a thing before? Like, why did there have to be this big push for the website to do that? And it's just like super strange. The details of that are really horrifying. The reason it got swiped is because this really famous journalist at New York Times wrote an article called the Children of Pornhub.
[00:21:14.650] 这是个必要的改变。我觉得影响非常大。但同时我也在想，为什么之前没人这么做？为什么网站非得费这么大劲才这么做？这真的太奇怪了。事情的细节令人毛骨悚然。它被盗用的原因是，《纽约时报》一位非常著名的记者写了一篇题为《Pornhub的孩子们》的文章。
[00:21:38.750] And he found the shocking amount of child porn that was on there. And a lot of them, there was one instance where there was a missing child and her family discovered her via photos or videos on there. They're impossible to remove even if you tell Pornhub, these are kids like they just won't remove the videos until this article came out. And then finally, like Visa and MasterCard were like, oh,
[00:21:38.750] 他发现上面竟然有数量惊人的儿童色情内容。其中很多，甚至有一个失踪儿童的家人就是通过网站上的照片或视频找到她的。即使你告诉Pornhub这些都是孩子，他们也根本不可能删除，直到这篇文章发表后才停止。最后，Visa和MasterCard才反应过来，哦，
[00:22:06.090] we're not going to support this anymore. Because now we're being publicly called out, even though they were supporting them for years knowing what's going on. And then they swiped everything only when this article came out. But you could like cry to Pornhub and be like, that's my five year old daughter. I'm exaggerating probably not, you know, but my underage daughter on there. And they would not give a fuck. That is absolutely horrifying. Yeah. It's like dark how
[00:22:06.090] 我们不会再支持这种行为了。因为现在我们被公开谴责了，尽管他们多年来一直支持他们，明知发生了什么。然后这篇文章出来后，他们才把一切都撤了下来。但你可以哭着去Pornhub说，那是我五岁的女儿。我可能有点夸张，但你知道，我未成年的女儿在上面。他们根本不会在意。这太可怕了。是啊。这简直太黑暗了。
[00:22:32.490] wild west it was. And then now it's kind of scary too, because we have AI and there's what is that thing called where you can do very realistic porn with people's faces? Oh, like I think it's like deep fakes or something. Yeah. Now we have like a whole nother world of things to worry about. It's crazy. Yeah, I feel like I've heard people in like high school having to deal with deep fakes.
[00:22:32.490] 以前简直就是蛮荒西部。现在也挺吓人的，因为我们有了人工智能，还有那种能用人脸制作非常逼真的色情片的技术叫什么来着？哦，我想应该是深度伪造之类的。对。现在我们又多了一大堆需要担心的事情。太疯狂了。是啊，我感觉我都听说高中生都得应付深度伪造技术了。
[00:22:58.370] Oh my god. Oh my god. Yeah. I can't even imagine being growing up now with the internet. You're like a little child and there's like boys just convincing you to send nudes because that's what they see on like Euphoria or whatever. And then that haunts you for the rest of your life. They don't realize that they're so young. But I still think the world has gotten a lot better. But there are,
[00:22:58.370] 我的天哪。我的天哪。是啊。我简直无法想象在互联网时代长大会是什么样子。你就像个小孩子，就会有男生哄骗你发裸照，因为他们在《亢奋》之类的剧里看到过。然后这件事就会伴随你一生。他们根本没意识到自己还那么小。但我仍然觉得世界已经变得更好了。不过，也存在一些问题。
[00:23:23.710] you know, some things. Some things still need work. Yeah, that's true. I feel like everyone is definitely like a little more aware, a little more educated. But yeah, like with new technologies comes new problems. So hopefully we're able to adapt quickly to all this kind of stuff. Yeah. I think you even see it in like OnlyFans, for example. I feel like with OnlyFans getting really
[00:23:23.710] 你知道，有些事情，有些事情还需要改进。是的，没错。我觉得大家确实都更加了解情况，也更有见识了。但是，新技术也会带来新的问题。所以，希望我们能够迅速适应所有这些变化。是的。我觉得你甚至可以在OnlyFans上看到这一点，比如OnlyFans。我觉得OnlyFans的发展势头非常强劲。
[00:23:48.650] big, a lot of people in that career path were able to kind of take control of the financials of their content or like even just how their content is like produced and shared out to the world. But then also at the same time, I feel like it lowers the barrier to entry to a certain degree. So then maybe some people are pushed into it or encouraged into it when they wouldn't have explored it in the first place. So it's like all these weird nuances that we have to navigate
[00:23:48.650] 很多走这条职业道路的人都能掌控自己内容的财务，甚至能掌控内容的制作和发布方式。但与此同时，我觉得这也在一定程度上降低了准入门槛。所以有些人可能被推入或鼓励进入这个领域，而他们原本可能根本不会考虑。因此，我们需要应对所有这些微妙的差别。
[00:24:15.630] with the internet making everything easier and better, but also like worse at the same time. So it's like you just never know how to kind of shape that pool, especially for young women who maybe are like more impressionable. What I didn't have growing up was a lot of conversations about it. So just hearing different perspectives or different media out there. There was so limited media back then. So I think that's kind of the gift of this generation that they do have a lot of influencers.
[00:24:15.630] 互联网让一切都变得更便捷、更美好，但同时也带来了一些负面影响。所以你永远无法预知该如何引导舆论走向，尤其对于可能更容易受影响的年轻女性而言。我成长过程中很少有机会谈论这些，也很少接触到不同的观点或媒体。那时候的媒体资源非常有限。因此，我认为这一代人的优势之一就是他们拥有众多有影响力的人物。
[00:24:44.090] They can listen to a lot of movies, TV and all kinds of stuff that is more directed towards a more multifaceted Asian experience. Yeah, that's so true. As we have mentioned, you know, growing up 2000s, like there's no really like Asian American presence in the media. So if someone wanted to pursue that, they literally have to make their own path, figure out what is the best way to get there, make their own mistakes. Even the idea of
[00:24:44.090] 他们可以看很多电影、电视节目以及各种各样的其他内容，这些都更侧重于展现更多元化的亚洲体验。没错，确实如此。正如我们之前提到的，在2000年代成长起来的人，在媒体上几乎看不到亚裔美国人的身影。所以，如果有人想从事这方面的工作，他们就必须自己摸索，找到最佳途径，经历各种错误。甚至连……
[00:25:12.770] talking about it with your parents as like an Asian American kid just feels impossible. Like that's not even close to an option. But yeah, like the comparison to now it's like, oh, there's actually people who you can look up to and different like pads that you can see. So I feel like I'm definitely very thankful that people can actually see people that they can look up to and like learn from versus
[00:25:12.770] 作为一个亚裔美国孩子，跟父母谈论这件事感觉根本不可能。这根本就不是一个选项。但是，现在的情况和以前相比，感觉就像，哦，现在真的有可以效仿的榜样，可以看到不同的例子。所以我真的非常感激，人们现在终于能看到可以效仿和学习的人了。
[00:25:39.370] what we were like trying to figure out as we were getting older. It's crazy because the changes are exponential at this point. It isn't even like, oh, we have like a good amount of more representation. It's just like for me as a child, this is a shocking amount of representation. Like it's unimaginable. I think I mentioned K-pop being on the radio and like all these non-Asians trying to learn Korean because they want to listen. That's crazy. Like I couldn't have imagined that.
[00:25:39.370] 我们长大后一直在努力理解这一切。这太疯狂了，因为现在的变化简直是指数级的。这甚至不是那种“哦，我们现在有了更多代表性”的情况。对我来说，小时候，这种程度的代表性简直令人震惊。简直难以想象。我想我之前提到过，电台里开始播放K-pop，很多非亚裔的人为了听K-pop而努力学习韩语。这太不可思议了。我以前根本无法想象。
[00:26:09.370] No, I felt like in my childhood, I would literally have to explain to people what Korea was because I was like, oh, I'm Korean. And they're like, oh, is that like near Japan? And I would be like, oh, yeah, it's like, you know, a peninsula attached to China, like next to Japan. And then now sometimes at work, people would be like, oh, you're Korean. Did you watch whatever K-drama? And I'm like, oh my God, I did not watch that. Like I don't even watch. They're like naming some obscure drama.
[00:26:09.370] 不，我觉得我小时候真的得跟别人解释韩国是什么，因为我会说，哦，我是韩国人。他们会问，哦，韩国是不是靠近日本？我会说，哦，对，就是一个半岛，你知道的，跟中国连在一起，就在日本旁边。然后现在有时候在工作中，别人会说，哦，你是韩国人。你看过那部韩剧吗？我就会说，我的天哪，我没看过。我根本不看。他们说的都是些冷门剧。
[00:26:36.310] I remember Jisoo has mentioned before where she was like, I feel like I have to be like a professional Korean. Because everybody wants to know everything. Are you like the go-to source for like recommendations of Korean things? Yeah, it's like random stuff too. Like at work, I once had this coworker who would be like, can you share your like kimchi recipe? And I'd be like, wait, I've like never made this before. Like even my mom just buys it.
[00:26:36.310] 我记得Jisoo之前说过，她感觉自己好像得像个专业的韩国人一样，因为大家都想知道所有关于韩国的事情。你是不是那种大家对韩国事物都了如指掌的专家？对啊，也包括一些零零碎碎的东西。比如在公司，我之前有个同事会问我，能不能分享一下你的泡菜配方？然后我就说，等等，我从来没做过泡菜啊。连我妈都是直接买现成的。
[00:27:05.590] Like I've never made kimchi from scratch. I still have to call my mom sometimes and be like, how should I do this? And my mom will often just be like, just buy it. Like this brand tastes the best. Yeah, the bot ones are really good, right? Yeah. And I feel like also when like we were growing up, K-pop was such a more like niche slash nerdy thing. And then now it's like mainstream media. Like K-pop is at Lollapalooza this weekend.
[00:27:05.590] 我从来没自己做过泡菜。有时候我还是得打电话问我妈，我该怎么做？我妈通常就说，买就行了。比如，这个牌子的泡菜最好吃。对啊，那种瓶装的确实很好吃，对吧？没错。而且我觉得，在我们小时候，K-pop 还是一种比较小众或者宅的东西。现在它都成主流媒体了。比如，K-pop 这周末就要去 Lollapalooza 音乐节了。
[00:27:34.270] It's main, it's leading media, I think. And the interesting part of it is like, it's not that Western media ever wanted to feature K-pop. You know, it's not, it's just became so financially beneficial that they were like, okay, let's get in on this. Right. I think you even see it in interviews. Like sometimes late night shows will feature like a male K-pop idol group or something. And one of the common themes in K-pop idol groups,
[00:27:34.270] 我认为它是主流媒体，是主导媒体。有趣的是，西方媒体并非一开始就想报道K-pop。你知道，并非如此，只是因为它有利可图，所以他们才想，好吧，我们也来凑个热闹。没错。我觉得你甚至在一些采访中也能看到这一点。比如，有时深夜脱口秀节目会邀请一些K-pop男团之类的嘉宾。而K-pop男团的一个共同点是，
[00:28:00.930] they'll usually have one or two native English speakers so that it can attract like a bigger fan base. Sometimes you'll see the hosts literally be like, oh, your English is so good. Like, where'd you learn it? And then the guy has to be like, I'm Canadian. Or like, I'm from the US. Like I'm from Mississippi. And it's like, yeah, they do zero research, but they only have these people on just because it makes money and gets views. It's good. Cause I feel like we have a huge purchasing power, the Asian community.
[00:28:00.930] 他们通常会请一两个英语母语人士，这样才能吸引更多粉丝。有时候你会看到主持人夸奖说：“哇，你的英语真好，你是从哪儿学的？” 然后那人就得回答：“我是加拿大人。”或者“我来自美国，比如密西西比州。” 感觉他们根本不做任何调查，请这些人上节目纯粹是为了赚钱和提高点击量。这挺好的，因为我觉得我们亚裔群体拥有巨大的购买力。
[00:28:28.430] And now it's like talking and corporations have to listen because they care about who's buying stuff, you know? Yeah. I do wonder how it affects like the younger generation though. I wonder if Asian guys feel like they have to uphold a certain image or something at school or they feel commodified because they do like, okay. But the difference is that guys don't mind being fetishized. Whenever you talk to an Asian guy about it, they're like, great.
[00:28:28.430] 现在就像是，人们开始谈论这件事，而企业不得不听，因为他们关心谁在买东西，你知道吗？是啊。不过，我确实很好奇这会对年轻一代产生什么影响。我想知道亚洲男生是否会觉得他们在学校里必须维护某种形象，或者觉得自己被物化了，因为他们确实……好吧。但不同的是，男生并不介意被物化。每当你和亚洲男生谈论这件事时，他们都会说，太好了。
[00:28:59.730] But I just don't think women objectify men the same way. And it doesn't lead to violence. And it wasn't born of violence. I think that's the big difference. But yes, it shows you how who's desirable is totally a media construct. Cause growing up, we had these nerdy characters that were like emasculated. And now that BTS and others are huge.
[00:28:59.730] 但我认为女性对男性的物化方式并不相同。而且这不会导致暴力，也不是暴力造成的。我认为这是最大的区别。但的确，这说明“谁有吸引力”完全是媒体建构的产物。因为我们小时候，那些书呆子角色都被阉割了。而现在，BTS 和其他一些组合却红极一时。
[00:29:25.010] I go on TikTok and there's all these like beautiful white girls saying like, oh, I love Korean guys. So it's just because whatever the media pushes as desirable, people get influenced by it. So it's like totally not set in stone. Yeah, that's so true. Sometimes like noticing and becoming aware of like the media narrative is really eyeopening. You're like, oh wait, I've just been letting myself be influenced by
[00:29:25.010] 我上TikTok，看到好多漂亮的白人女孩说，哦，我喜欢韩国男生。所以说，媒体宣传的理想形象，人们都会受到影响。所以这完全不是一成不变的。是啊，确实如此。有时候，注意到媒体的叙事方式，真的会让人大开眼界。你会想，哦，等等，我一直以来都让自己被影响了。
[00:29:54.330] what is being put out in all of these articles and like, I don't know, TMZ or stuff like that. It is hard, I think, to avoid that. But it's helpful to sometimes take a step back and like realize what is happening. And sometimes you're just falling into the media wave, the mainstream wave. And I mean, sometimes that's okay. But also sometimes it's like, okay, like I need to figure
[00:29:54.330] 所有这些文章，还有像TMZ之类的媒体，都在报道些什么？我觉得很难完全避免。但有时候退一步，冷静思考一下发生了什么，会很有帮助。有时候你会不由自主地被媒体浪潮、被主流媒体裹挟。我的意思是，有时候这样也没什么不好。但有时候，我也会想，好吧，我需要好好想想。
[00:30:20.290] out how I can like make my own opinions too. And that's probably like the hardest part. And I think that's so important right now because it's like such a divisive time where people are so polarized and on extreme sides. So like one way to do that, I think is diversifying the media you watch and not just limited to one culture, you know, like just get out of your own bubble and see what other
[00:30:20.290] 弄清楚我该如何形成自己的观点。这大概是最难的部分。我觉得这一点现在非常重要，因为这是一个充满分裂的时代，人们的观点两极分化，走向极端。所以，我认为一种方法是拓展你观看的媒体，不要局限于单一文化，走出你的信息茧房，看看其他文化。
[00:30:45.190] people outside your immediate circle are doing. I think that's, you know, awesome with K-pop because we're learning about another country. Americans like barely, you know, are taught geography or like other world histories. And we probably need it the most right now. I think one of the things that does scare me a little bit is sometimes when I watch Korean content, I feel like there's this big focus on like the age of women.
[00:30:45.190] 你圈子以外的人也在做这件事。我觉得K-pop很棒，因为我们能从中了解另一个国家。美国人几乎不怎么学地理或者其他国家的历史。而我们现在可能最需要这些知识。我觉得让我有点担心的一点是，有时候我看韩国的内容，感觉他们特别关注女性的年龄。
[00:31:14.430] Yeah, the age is a problem. Right. We were kind of laughing about this meme that we put on the doc in our intro call, where it's like the average Asian aging process. And it's just like, you know, like a very young looking woman from like age 18 to age 50. And then suddenly at age 60, they become like a ajumma or whatever. And I feel like the way that K-pop fans or like the Korean media will talk about
[00:31:14.430] 是啊，年龄确实是个问题。没错。我们在开场电话会议里放了一张纪录片的梗图，还挺搞笑的，图上画的是亚洲人的平均衰老过程。你知道，就像那种从18岁到50岁看起来都很年轻的女性，然后突然到了60岁，就变成了大妈之类的。我觉得K-pop粉丝或者韩国媒体谈论这件事的方式……
[00:31:40.050] a K-pop idol that's in her like early 30s or something to us that still feels super young. But in a lot of like Korean comments or something, it'll be like, oh, she's so old now. Like you can tell she doesn't even look as good as insert whatever new 18 year old is like the girl nowadays. Yeah. As an Asian woman, that scares me. Even though I actively try to fight it, it still is so internalized in me. And it makes me afraid of aging. And I don't know if that's just
[00:31:40.050] 一个韩国流行偶像，在我们看来大概三十出头，但感觉依然很年轻。但在很多韩国网友的评论里，却会说：“哦，她现在好老啊。” 好像她看起来都不如现在那些十八岁的新晋女星年轻漂亮似的。是啊。作为一个亚洲女性，这让我很害怕。虽然我一直在努力克服这种想法，但它仍然根深蒂固。这让我害怕变老。我不知道这是否只是我个人的感受。
[00:32:08.850] a me thing or if everyone else is like also internalizing this, you know? No, no. I think that's like taught on women in general. But yes, I do think K-pop is so positive in many ways. But South Korea, in addition to all the East Asian countries are heavily patriarchal. My book is mostly a criticism of the way that Asian women are like presented in Western media. That being said, I would rather live here than like East Asia. I think it's very tough to be a
[00:32:08.850] 这是我自身的问题，还是其他人也都在潜移默化地影响我？不，不。我觉得这好像是女性普遍被灌输的观念。不过，我确实认为韩流在很多方面都很积极。但是，韩国，以及所有东亚国家，都是父权制根深蒂固的地方。我的书主要是在批判西方媒体对亚洲女性的刻板印象。话虽如此，我还是宁愿住在这里，而不是东亚。我觉得在这里做一名……
[00:32:36.430] woman there. The beauty standards that are expected. When you apply to a job, I think you have to have a photo or something, you know? Right. They start idols under age, right? And I don't know how you feel about Ayo, but like I feel like I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, but it promotes like a childlike feminism that is a little questionable to me too. Yeah. There's different problems in every culture.
[00:32:36.430] 那里的女人。人们对美的标准。我觉得你申请工作的时候，应该得附上照片什么的，你知道吗？对。他们从小就培养偶像，对吧？我不知道你对Ayo有什么看法，但我觉得，我不知道我发音对不对，它宣扬的是一种幼稚的女权主义，我觉得也有点问题。是啊。每种文化都有不同的问题。
[00:33:02.890] Whenever I see like dramas or something like that where there's a huge age gap, I'm just like, I can't watch this, dude. Yeah. It's just like, it's too weird when like, especially if maybe like the female actor is not only playing a young character, but looks really young. I'm just like, oh, this is so wrong. And the man looks like he's 40 or something. I'm just like, uh, yeah. Yeah. That's getting better. Cause like we didn't even question the age gap growing up. It was just
[00:33:02.890] 每当我看到那种男女主角年龄差距很大的电视剧之类的，我就觉得，这我看不下去了。真的。感觉太奇怪了，尤其是当女演员不仅扮演年轻角色，而且看起来也很年轻的时候。我就觉得，哦，这太不对劲了。而男主角看起来像40岁左右。我就觉得，呃，是啊。是啊。情况正在好转。因为我们小时候根本不会去在意年龄差距。
[00:33:32.850] like, oh, okay. That's how like so many shows are. I mean, I feel like Woody Allen was like casting himself with like 17 and 16 year olds. So like in there's this really huge movie that everybody loves. I'm not a Woody Harrelson or Woody Allen, but yeah, there's like some influential romantic movie that tons of people love and it's him and like a 17 year old or something. And that was
[00:33:32.850] 哦，好吧。很多剧都是这样。我的意思是，我觉得伍迪·艾伦就像是找了16、17岁的孩子来演自己。所以，有一部很火的电影，大家都喜欢。我不是伍迪·哈里森，也不是伍迪·艾伦，但是，确实有一部很有影响力的爱情片，很多人都喜欢，主演是他和一个大概17岁的孩子。就是这样。
[00:33:58.790] acceptable that nobody questioned the age gap whatsoever. So now at least people will point out, oh, that age gap is weird. Like that's in our vocabulary. Yeah. That's progress. Or at least like when you see a big age gap, there will be people like criticizing it. Right. And also to what we were talking about earlier, I feel like 30 has been such a specific
[00:33:58.790] 没人质疑年龄差距，这倒也说得过去。现在至少有人会指出，哦，这个年龄差距有点奇怪。好像“年龄差距”这个词已经出现在我们的词汇表里了。没错，这就是进步。或者至少，当你看到年龄差距很大的时候，会有人提出批评。对。还有，就像我们之前讨论的那样，我觉得30岁一直是一个非常特殊的年龄。
[00:34:21.570] age that like is for some reason very important. Suddenly, you know, when you're 30, you're, you can't be a young adult anymore. And media really focuses on 30 being like over the hill, I guess. You know, now that's when you start getting like mom roles or like, you know, older roles. And I've noticed that happens in Asian media as well. There's literally like a Chinese
[00:34:21.570] 年龄不知为何似乎非常重要。突然间，你知道，当你30岁的时候，你就不能再是年轻人了。媒体似乎也特别关注30岁，好像它就意味着“过气”。你知道，到了30岁，你就会开始接到一些角色，比如妈妈之类的，或者其他年纪稍长的角色。我注意到亚洲媒体也存在这种情况。比如，中国就有一个……
[00:34:49.070] show about people in the entertainment industry who are now 30 or older. And then they like get on this show to form some sort of like girl group and show that they can still or they still have it in them. And like, yeah, watching that, I'm like, wait, 30 is not even old. And I feel like I see memes sometimes where people are like, wow, you look so young for being like 30 to mid 30s. And
[00:34:49.070] 有个节目是关于娱乐圈里那些30岁或以上的人。他们参加节目，组成一个女子组合之类的，证明自己宝刀未老。然后，看着这些节目，我就想，等等，30岁根本不算老。我有时候看到一些表情包，上面有人说，哇，你看起来好年轻，都30到35岁了。
[00:35:16.490] people are like, I think you just don't know what people in their 30s look like. Like they just look like the same thing as people in their 20s. I like that they're being called out for. That reminds me of when I first started working. And then I just assumed everyone was like my age, because I also did not have a ton of viz onto like what adulthood looked like. To an extent, I feel like women just aren't allowed to exist in that space. Because if you go on like Pornhub,
[00:35:16.490] 人们会说，我觉得你根本不知道30多岁的人长什么样。好像他们看起来和20多岁的人没什么两样似的。我很高兴有人指出他们的这种错误观念。这让我想起我刚开始工作的时候。那时候我以为所有人都和我差不多大，因为我对成年人的生活也没有什么概念。在某种程度上，我觉得女性似乎不被允许出现在那个领域。因为如果你去Pornhub之类的网站看看，
[00:35:43.750] the categories are like teen and then MILF. And it's like, what about all the people who are like in the middle? Like that's crazy. I mean, I've definitely seen that I never noticed that those were the only two age categories of women, which you are correct. That's disturbing. Because it's teen. It's not like young woman. Pornhub is a disturbing representation of the categories that
[00:35:43.750] 这些分类就像是“少女”和“熟女”。那那些介于两者之间的人呢？这太离谱了。我的意思是，我确实注意到了这一点，但我以前从来没注意到女性的年龄分类只有这两个，你说得对。这很令人不安。因为这里说的是“少女”，而不是“年轻女性”。Pornhub对分类的呈现方式令人不安。
[00:36:12.670] to put women in. Because there are so many popular Asian categories. There's like Asian, and then there's like anime or Japanese girl. And it gets really detailed. Yeah, I think you mentioned this in your book too, where I thought it was a really good point where you're saying like, if you just look at Pornhub categories, you can see what people are fetishizing, what people are interested in. It's a more like stripped down real version than what we see in media.
[00:36:12.670] 把女性归类。因为亚洲有很多热门分类。比如有“亚洲人”，然后还有“动漫”或“日本女孩”。而且分类非常细致。是的，我想你在书中也提到过这一点，我觉得你说的很有道理，比如，如果你看看Pornhub的分类，就能看出人们迷恋什么，对什么感兴趣。这比我们在媒体上看到的更真实、更纯粹。
[00:36:41.770] And so if you ever need a wake up call, just like go there and like look at these categories and be like, what the fuck? Yeah. It's like they aren't censoring themselves over there. Yeah. So I guess on the topic of porn or just the spaces that women exist in, in like a guy's brain, I guess, or like the collective man's brain, I feel like male gaze and like the standards of male gaze is something that you touch on often in your book as well. And I guess knowing everything
[00:36:41.770] 所以，如果你需要警醒，就去看看这些分类，然后惊呼：这他妈什么鬼？没错。感觉他们那边根本不审查自己。是啊。所以，关于色情，或者说女性在男性脑海中，或者说在男性群体的脑海中所处的空间，我觉得男性凝视以及男性凝视的标准，也是你在书中经常提到的。而且，我想，了解这一切之后，你就会明白我的意思。
[00:37:11.690] that you've experienced now and knowing what you know now, like, are there things that help you manage releasing yourself from the standards of the male gaze or just like things that you do that help you center yourself in your confidence? Yeah, I mean, I want to say I never want to judge a woman for her choices. For me, I kind of led with my sexuality and my youth and that was not authentic to me. But somebody else might do those things. And that's very authentic to them. And that rings
[00:37:11.690] 以你现在的经历和认知，有没有什么方法能帮助你摆脱男性凝视的束缚，或者说，有没有什么方法能让你重拾自信？嗯，我的意思是，我永远不想评判女性的选择。就我而言，我曾经一度被自己的性魅力和青春活力所左右，但那并非我真实的自我。但其他人或许会那样做，而那对他们来说却是真实的。这很能引起我的共鸣。
[00:37:40.810] true to them. I was definitely not going according to like my inner feelings and values. I was pushing those aside to get validation. That being said, I still like looking cute and pretty or whatever, you know, I think you'll always as a woman feel like you want to be attractive. You know, there's that saying where you like put on a fresh coat of lipstick and you could like face the day
[00:37:40.810] 对他们来说，我绝对没有按照自己的内心感受和价值观行事。我把它们抛到脑后，只是为了寻求认同。话虽如此，我仍然喜欢看起来可爱漂亮什么的，你知道，我觉得作为女人，你总是会想要让自己有吸引力。你知道，有句话说，涂上新口红，你就可以自信地面对新的一天。
[00:38:05.210] because you feel like you, you know, got your warrior paint on or whatever, because that's what women need. But yeah, for that, I've just done tons and tons of self worth. I didn't even know growing up that I had such a lack of self love. Because I think also as Asians, we're not taught about self love is not like really a thing. Asian culture is such a collective society. American
[00:38:05.210] 因为你会觉得自己像个女战士，你知道，就像涂上了战袍什么的，因为女人就需要这种感觉。是的，为此，我做了很多很多提升自我价值的工作。我以前甚至不知道自己这么缺乏自爱。因为我觉得，作为亚洲人，我们从小就没有被教育过自爱是什么，它似乎并不像是一个重要的概念。亚洲文化是一个非常注重集体主义的社会。
[00:38:30.530] culture is an individualistic society. And I think it's so important to teach youth to learn self love because it's a practice. It's not like necessarily something that comes naturally. So for me, it's like practices like meditation and journaling and all that like woo woo stuff. But I think it really helps just trying to pay attention because like sometimes I'll have feelings like, oh, this is maybe not right. But you push it aside because you're like, oh, let's just go along with
[00:38:30.530] 文化是一个个人主义盛行的社会。我认为教导年轻人学会爱自己非常重要，因为爱自己是一种需要练习的事情，它并非与生俱来。对我来说，这就像冥想、写日记之类的练习，听起来有点玄乎。但我认为，努力去觉察自己的感受真的很有帮助，因为有时候我会觉得，哦，这可能不太对劲。但你会把它放在一边，因为你会想，哦，还是顺其自然吧。
[00:38:59.090] the crowd or whatever. And it's just being in touch with yourself. So you can hear those and like, pay attention to them. Yeah, therapy helps a lot. Yeah, that's a really good point, though, about how we aren't really taught self love in Asian American households. The focus is always just, you know, get your studies in order. Yeah, achieve.
[00:38:59.090] 人群什么的。关键在于与自己保持联系。这样你才能听到那些声音，并加以注意。是的，心理治疗很有帮助。不过，你说的很有道理，亚裔美国家庭确实很少教导我们如何爱自己。他们总是把重点放在学习上，努力取得成就上。
[00:39:22.330] I guess like maybe the optimistic outlook of this is that I feel like this generation with immigrant parents. We grow up and then we realize we need to explore more of this taking care of yourself, mind, body health. And then when we grow up and or when we have kids and like, you know, bring forth the next generation, hopefully we're bringing them into a more holistically aware slash healthy
[00:39:22.330] 我想，或许乐观的一面在于，我觉得我们这一代人，尤其是父母是移民的这一代人，长大后会意识到我们需要更多地关注自己的身心健康。然后，当我们长大成人，或者有了孩子，孕育出下一代时，我们希望能够培养他们更全面、更健康的生活方式。
[00:39:50.850] situation where it's not just about achieving. It's also about, you know, taking care of yourself and learning to do what you love and what aligns with your own values. Yeah, I feel like my parents generation was taught from their parents that criticizing is the best way to get your kids to do more. And it does work. Like if you're saying like, oh, look at like,
[00:39:50.850] 这种情况不仅仅关乎成就，也关乎照顾好自己，学会做自己热爱的事情，做符合自己价值观的事情。是的，我觉得我父母那一代人从他们的父母那里学到的是，批评是让孩子进步的最好方法。而且这确实有效。比如，如果你说，哦，你看，
[00:40:14.750] your cousin over there, achieving this, how come you can't do that? It will push you probably to try to like achieve more. But then it might leave you with, you know, a little ding on your self esteem too. So for me, it made me just look at everything like a competition. And it's just not because really, there's like enough room for everybody if we look at the world as abundant place, but we don't. I
[00:40:14.750] 你表哥在那边都做到了，为什么你做不到？这可能会激励你去追求更高的成就。但同时，也可能会打击你的自尊心。所以对我来说，这让我把所有事情都看作是一场竞争。其实并非如此，因为如果我们把世界看作一个资源丰富的地方，它其实足够容纳所有人，但我们并没有这样做。
[00:40:41.510] always saw it as a zero sum game where only some people can get the spoils of whatever. You know, it is kind of interesting, though, not to derail this whole conversation. But there's some like discourse on TikTok where millennials are pointing out that Gen Z and their behavior patterns are kind of similar to like boomers. And I feel like millennials are kind of considered like the nice generation or like the soft generation where we care a lot about other people and like,
[00:40:41.510] 我一直觉得这是一场零和博弈，只有一部分人能获得利益。不过，为了不跑题，我还是说说一些有趣的事情。TikTok 上有一些讨论，千禧一代指出 Z 世代的行为模式和婴儿潮一代有些相似。我觉得千禧一代通常被认为是比较友善的一代，或者说比较温柔的一代，我们很关心他人，而且……
[00:41:10.810] you know, all these values that maybe our parents generations weren't hyper focused on, but they say that Gen Z are kind of bringing back that boomer pattern. So we'll kind of see how it evolves with them. Wait, what's the boomer pattern just not caring about other people? Yeah, like sort of focusing on yourself and like your own needs instead of worrying about like, oh, what do these other people want? Or like, what are the rights of other people? And it's kind of
[00:41:10.810] 你知道，所有这些价值观，也许我们父母那一代人并不特别关注，但据说Z世代正在重新拾起婴儿潮一代的模式。所以我们会看看这种模式会如何发展。等等，婴儿潮一代的模式是什么？就是不关心别人吗？对，就是更关注自己和自己的需求，而不是去想，哦，其他人想要什么？或者，其他人的权利是什么？这有点像……
[00:41:37.510] interesting because Gen Z tends to be like politically charged to a certain extent. But maybe with the younger Gen Z, that's maybe getting more extreme or fading away of like, oh, everyone else in my generation is so political. I want to be apolitical to an extent. So interesting. I like proclaim myself as a closeted Gen Z. So I like try to keep up with like that discourse on TikTok.
[00:41:37.510] 很有意思，因为Z世代在某种程度上都比较关注政治。但也许在更年轻的Z世代中，这种现象正在变得更加极端，或者逐渐消失，比如“哦，我们这代人都太政治化了，我也想保持一定程度的非政治性”。真有意思。我自称是“隐藏的Z世代”，所以我会尽量关注TikTok上的相关讨论。
[00:42:04.150] It's so interesting how like entire generations will have a theme and really play into it. It's funny how it works out that way. Yeah, I think one of the funniest things that I've heard about Gen Z is that they have this like Gen Z stare. Yes. Yeah. I wrote an article about that actually. Oh, yeah. So you know all about it. I feel like it's just so funny about how like,
[00:42:04.150] 很有意思的是，好像整整几代人都会围绕某个主题，并且会全身心地投入其中。这种现象真是太有趣了。是啊，我觉得关于Z世代最搞笑的说法之一就是他们有一种“Z世代式凝视”。没错。是啊。我其实还专门写过一篇关于这个的文章。哦，是啊。所以你很了解。我觉得这真的很有趣，就像……
[00:42:27.530] they do not give a fuck about like, just like service. And then millennials, on the other hand, are like so careful about it. And they really want everyone to feel welcome and comfortable. And that just completely ties in with what you just said, Jisoo, about like millennials caring about other people more. And then Gen Zs are just like, is there something you need? Like, they like just stare at you. Yeah, I know what it is in theory, but I've never encountered it in real life. Have you?
[00:42:27.530] 他们根本不在乎服务之类的东西。而千禧一代则恰恰相反，他们非常注重服务，真心希望每个人都感到受欢迎和舒适。这和你刚才说的完全吻合，Jisoo，千禧一代更关心他人。而Z世代就只会问“你需要什么吗？”，他们会盯着你看。是啊，我理论上知道是什么，但我在现实生活中从未遇到过。你遇到过吗？
[00:42:57.390] I think I haven't yet. Not to a point where it like left an impression. But one of my friends said that she recently experienced it, and she was like, it was kind of weird. I felt bad to like even ask for whatever they like want me to do. Oh, really? I think I've experienced it too. Usually at a coffee shop or something, I like walk in and I expect to have them be like, hi, do you want to order something?
[00:42:57.390] 我想我还没遇到过。至少还没到给我留下什么印象的地步。但我一个朋友说她最近遇到过，她说感觉有点怪。我甚至都不好意思开口问他们想让我做什么。哦，真的吗？我觉得我也遇到过。通常是在咖啡馆之类的地方，我走进去，以为他们会问：“你好，请问您要点什么吗？”
[00:43:23.650] But then the worker was just like staring. And then I have to be like, can I order? Like, sorry to bother you. Well, that is a whole theme too, because I think the quiet quitting thing probably applies to Gen Z, not millennials. Millennials are the girl boss generation, I'm assuming. And quiet quitting,
[00:43:23.650] 但那位店员就一直盯着我看。然后我不得不说：“我可以点餐吗？” 好像在说：“不好意思打扰您了。” 嗯，这其实也是个普遍现象，因为我觉得“悄悄辞职”这种事可能更适用于Z世代，而不是千禧一代。我猜千禧一代是女强人的天下。至于“悄悄辞职”，
[00:43:46.450] I think is just doing your job and nothing more, I think, which is in a way it's like self care. It's like not working overtime or this and that, and not going above and beyond. But yeah, I guess I can see that with Gen Z, because that's a Gen Z trend. Yeah, I guess millennials are just forever people pleasers. I think I saw a TikTok that said, if you message a Gen Z person after work hours,
[00:43:46.450] 我觉得就是做好本职工作，仅此而已，某种程度上来说，这就像是一种自我关爱。比如不加班什么的，不做任何超出职责范围的事情。不过，我猜我能理解Z世代的想法，因为这是Z世代的一种潮流。是啊，我觉得千禧一代永远都是讨好型人格。我好像在TikTok上看到过一个视频，说如果你在下班后给Z世代的人发信息，
[00:44:16.510] they just like straight up will not respond. But then if you message a millennial, they'll be like, oh, you know, sorry, I'll respond tomorrow. Or like, they'll have some sort of response, even if they don't get to it right away. And I was like, damn, we really are that generation. But like lean in generation. That's pretty powerful to just not respond though. Maybe we need to just pull different traits from each generation to become the ultimate person.
[00:44:16.510] 他们就是直接不回复。但如果你给千禧一代发消息，他们会说，哦，不好意思，我明天再回复。或者他们会回复，即使不能马上回复。我就想，天哪，我们这一代真的就是这样。但又像是“积极参与”的一代。这种不回复的方式其实挺厉害的。也许我们需要从每一代人身上汲取不同的特质，才能成为最完美的人。
[00:44:44.150] But speaking of all of that, before we wrap up, we wanted to ask you a final question. Do you think you have any advice now that you've, you know, gone through so much and learned so much advice for your younger self or even just like the general younger population? Yeah, like for her, my younger self in particular, I would just I know that's so cheesy, but I'd want to tell her like your loves like my parents loved me unconditionally.
[00:44:44.150] 不过说了这么多，在结束之前，我们想问你最后一个问题。你现在经历了这么多，学到了这么多，有没有什么建议可以给年轻时的自己，或者给所有年轻人？嗯，比如给年轻时的自己，我知道这听起来很老套，但我还是想告诉她，要像我的父母那样无条件地爱我。
[00:45:11.810] They maybe didn't show it in a traditional kind of way. But you know, they sacrificed and did everything for me and my brother. And I just didn't feel loved. And I didn't love myself. I don't know if that's advice I can give. But it's like, if we could teach young people how to love themselves, that would be so powerful, because it would just, I don't think we would be so fractured right now as a society if people love themselves, because when you love
[00:45:11.810] 他们或许没有用传统的方式表达爱，但你知道，他们为了我和我弟弟牺牲奉献了一切。而我却感受不到爱，也不爱自己。我不知道这算不算是我能给出的建议。但如果我们能教会年轻人如何爱自己，那将是多么强大的力量，因为如果人们都能爱自己，我想我们现在的社会就不会如此分裂。因为当你爱自己时，你就会明白爱的意义。
[00:45:37.970] yourselves, it's easier to love others, make that a priority, you know, know that you can give because okay, the one thing that's come up right now is I still have a huge drive for validation through achievement. That's just ingrained into me. I've been learning that I could give myself validation, instead of looking to all these outside things. Okay, I do have specific advice.
[00:45:37.970] 先爱自己，更容易去爱别人，把爱放在首位，要知道，你要明白自己能够付出。因为，我现在遇到的一个问题是，我仍然非常渴望通过成就来获得认可。这已经根深蒂固了。我一直在学习，我可以自我肯定，而不是依赖外在的一切。好吧，我有一些具体的建议。
[00:46:05.930] So there's a book that I'm reading right now called Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It. And it is so powerful. It's about this entrepreneur guy, and he was suicidal. And he just like learned, he just started telling himself 100 times a day. And he just made this the background, like, I love myself, I love myself, he'd say it out loud, he'd say it in the mirror, he'd say in the background, whenever something stressful happens, it's like, I love myself, I love myself.
[00:46:05.930] 我最近在读一本书，叫《像爱生命一样爱自己》。这本书非常震撼人心。它讲的是一个企业家，他曾经有自杀倾向。后来他学会了每天对自己说一百遍“我爱我自己”，把它变成一种习惯，比如大声说出来，对着镜子说，或者在心里默念。每当遇到压力的时候，他都会默念“我爱我自己”。
[00:46:33.430] And then his life began to change, like his health got better. And like doors started opening and just like all this crazy stuff. I've been doing it for like five days or something. I feel like I'm someone who loves myself quite a bit, because I've done a lot of recovery work, like years and years of it, but there's still work to be done, apparently. So yeah, I would recommend reading that book. And there's like a million helpful books out there on that same topic, too.
[00:46:33.430] 然后他的生活开始改变，比如他的健康状况好转了。机会之门也开始向他敞开，总之发生了各种不可思议的事情。我大概已经坚持了五天左右。我觉得自己现在很爱自己，因为我做了很多康复工作，好几年了，但显然还有很多工作要做。所以，我推荐你读读那本书。当然，市面上还有很多关于这个主题的实用书籍。
[00:47:02.350] It's a great piece of advice. And I feel like it's just so applicable to Asian Americans, especially really learn to get self validation. I think that's something that I also struggle with. I think, you know, I can relate to that where you're like, maybe if I achieve this, then my parents will be proud, all that kind of typical, you know, Asian American like narrative. So yeah, I really like
[00:47:02.350] 这是一条很棒的建议。我觉得它对亚裔美国人来说尤其适用，特别是要学会自我肯定。我觉得这也是我一直在努力克服的难题。你知道，我能理解那种感觉，你会想，如果我实现了这个目标，我的父母就会为我感到骄傲，诸如此类典型的亚裔美国人的想法。所以，是的，我真的很喜欢这条建议。
[00:47:27.730] that, you know, focusing on self love. Yeah, because that's infinite, you know, your parents is probably unconditional in many circumstances for Asian kids, but like, maybe not. But you can always give yourself all the love needed. But we don't realize that we're searching for that in a lover. We're searching for that validation from our parents, from our friends, when it's all really inside yourself. And you can never run away from yourself. She's always in there.
[00:47:27.730] 你知道，就是专注于自爱。是的，因为自爱是无限的。你知道，在很多情况下，亚洲孩子父母的爱可能是无条件的，但也许并非如此。但你总能给自己足够的爱。我们却没意识到，我们其实是在爱人身上寻找这种爱。我们寻求父母、朋友的认可，而这一切其实都源于内心。你永远无法逃离自己。她一直都在那里。
