[00:00:00.180] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Melissa and I'm Sunny Today we have a Pretty fun topic I think and our slang word is Actually very in line with our topic too. So the slang word we're talking about today is
[00:00:00.180] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal，我是Melissa，我是Sunny。今天我们要聊一个很有趣的话题，而且我们今天的俚语也和主题非常契合。所以，我们今天要聊的俚语是……
[00:00:30.560] Bruh girl, so does anyone know what this means? I feel like I'm running a class right now No definition of bro, girl I have definitely heard this word before but I think I heard it a couple years back
[00:00:30.560] 兄弟，妹子，有人知道这是什么意思吗？感觉我现在像是在上课一样。兄弟，妹子，没人知道这是什么意思。我肯定以前听过这个词，但好像是几年前听的。
[00:00:44.880] So I'm surprised to see that people still kind of use it or maybe it's like coming back in a second wave again But I think I understand it kind of like a tomboy. I think same here
[00:00:44.880] 所以我很惊讶地发现现在还有人用这个词，或许它正在以第二波浪潮回归吧。但我感觉我能理解它有点像假小子。我觉得这里也是一样。
[00:00:55.560] I feel like it's the girl that like can get along with the guys and use the term bra the way that guys do But I can't see that I've seen that word recently so my definition could be dated
[00:00:55.560] 我觉得这是指那种能和男生相处融洽，像男生一样使用“胸罩”这个词的女生。但我最近好像没怎么看到过这个词，所以我的理解可能过时了。
[00:01:07.760] Yeah, I'm surprised that it's still like in active use. I actually feel like I've been seeing bro girl More lately. This is the first time that I've seen it and then I've been seeing it more often on my like tik-tok for you page
[00:01:07.760] 是啊，我挺惊讶它居然还在流行。我感觉最近“bro girl”这个词出现的频率确实高了。这是我第一次看到，之后在我的TikTok推荐页面上就经常看到了。
[00:01:21.680] But yeah, I think you guys are all right And there's some funny definitions here on Urban Dictionary from 2020 The top definition says girls who don't like cheesy messages like good morning Beautiful or I hope you have an amazing day princess. They prefer to be sarcastic and joke around
[00:01:21.680] 不过，我觉得你们说的都对。Urban Dictionary 2020 年的一些定义挺有意思的。排名第一的定义是：不喜欢“早安，美女”或者“祝你今天过得愉快，公主”这种肉麻信息的女生。她们更喜欢用讽刺和玩笑的方式表达自己。
[00:01:42.480] They would rather a guy say what up stupid or you are a dummy instead I feel like all of those like all four of the example sentences are so bad Are those the only choices I Guess they're just the extremes
[00:01:42.480] 他们宁愿听到别人说“你个傻瓜”或者“你个笨蛋”，而不是我觉得这四个例句都很糟糕。难道只有这些选择吗？我猜它们只是极端情况。
[00:02:03.040] But there is also a know your meme page and it looks like one of the originating memes of like bra girl is Girls who say bra versus girls who say hi which with like hella eyes. Oh my god It says originating from a viral meme from
[00:02:03.040] 但是还有一个“了解你的梗”页面，看起来“胸罩女孩”这个梗的起源之一是“说胸罩的女孩”和“说嗨的女孩”的对比，后者眼神夸张。我的天哪！上面写着源自一个病毒式传播的梗。
[00:02:23.800] 2018 in which two groups were compared to Disney princesses and The princesses from Shrek and then that's how like it came. Oh my god, the image is hella funny It's like tangled Moana
[00:02:23.800] 2018年，有人把两组人分别比作迪士尼公主和《怪物史莱克》里的公主，然后就有了这张图。我的天，这张图太搞笑了，简直就像《魔发奇缘》和《海洋奇缘》的结合体。
[00:02:36.720] Cinderella and then the Shrek princesses are all like mean mugging at the camera and they're like buff as fuck Wait Shrek has more than one princess. Yeah Fiona Apparently in Shrek the third there's like more Yeah
[00:02:36.720] 灰姑娘和史莱克公主们都对着镜头摆出一副凶巴巴的表情，而且身材都超级棒。等等，史莱克不止一个公主啊。对，菲奥娜。据说在《史莱克3》里还有更多公主。
[00:02:57.280] This is kind of interesting though because I think part of it I can understand the distinction of Oh someone who's a tomboy Maybe not as externally girly prefers more sarcastic humor
[00:02:57.280] 这挺有意思的，因为我觉得我能理解其中的一些区别：哦，一个假小子可能外表上不太女性化，更喜欢讽刺幽默。
[00:03:08.440] but then the other part of me is like if you are the type of person who wants to be categorized as a Broke girl and seeks that characterization. Are you like a pick me? You know what I mean? Not like someone who is categorized as one
[00:03:08.440] 但另一方面，我又觉得，如果你是那种想要被贴上“穷女孩”标签，并且刻意追求这种标签的人，你是不是那种“求关注”的类型？你懂我的意思吗？不像那种本来就被贴上这种标签的人。
[00:03:22.060] But if you are like, oh I strive to be a bro girl like is that pick me? I feel like it's it's extremely not like other girls energy Yeah, I think I can definitely get that vibe
[00:03:22.060] 但如果你像这样，哦，我努力想成为一个像兄弟一样的女孩，那是不是就代表你在找我？我觉得这和其他女孩的能量完全不一样。嗯，我觉得我肯定能感受到那种氛围。
[00:03:32.880] I think one of the definitions that popped up was like not like the other girls like a bro girl But I always think this is really funny because we have a friend who says bro a lot but she's not necessarily
[00:03:32.880] 我觉得其中一个解释是，不像其他女孩那样，像个“兄弟女孩”。但我总觉得这很有趣，因为我们有个朋友经常说“兄弟”，但她其实并不一定像个“兄弟女孩”。
[00:03:47.000] I would say like a bruh girl or a high girl Like I don't think she's on either end of the spectrum necessarily I feel like she has bro girl habits and then high girl preferences But yeah, I feel like nowadays
[00:03:47.000] 我觉得她有点像那种“兄弟女孩”或者“潮女孩”。我觉得她不一定完全属于这两个极端，感觉她既有“兄弟女孩”的习惯，又有“潮女孩”的喜好。不过，我觉得现在这种情况……
[00:04:02.520] Especially maybe in California because I feel like we say words like dude Bro bro, whatever just more often. I don't know Maybe nowadays the distinction of like a bruh girl is not as clear-cut true Yeah, I feel like now saying that like am I a dude girl?
[00:04:02.520] 尤其是在加州，我觉得我们说“老兄”、“兄弟”之类的词更频繁了。我不知道，也许现在“哥们儿女孩”这种说法不像以前那么绝对了。是啊，我现在感觉自己好像成了“哥们儿女孩”了。
[00:04:20.320] I'm like I can never I can't imagine starting a conversation with bruh But I don't think I can start a conversation without saying dude completely agree
[00:04:20.320] 我感觉我永远也做不到，我根本无法想象用“兄弟”这个词来开启对话。但我觉得如果不说“哥们儿”，我就没法开始一段对话，完全同意。
[00:04:29.240] Actually one time I met someone not from California and they're like, did you know you say dude a lot? I was like fuck No So kind of working off of the characterization or archetypes of women
[00:04:29.240] 其实有一次我遇到一个不是加州人的人，她问我：“你知道你经常说‘老兄’吗？” 我当时就懵了，心想：我去，不知道。所以，我有点像是在模仿女性的性格特征或原型。
[00:04:44.960] I think another archetype that we see often is the it girl to me this one has a little bit more maybe positive connotations than a bruh girl, but I kind of defined the it girl as someone who
[00:04:44.960] 我认为我们经常看到的另一种典型形象是“It Girl”，对我来说，这个形象可能比“Bruh Girl”带有更多积极的含义，但我对“It Girl”的定义是：
[00:04:58.840] Everyone is paying attention to and is kind of like having a moment So I guess how else would you guys define the it girl? I think I agree Everyone is paying attention to them. I think they have kind of like a natural pull
[00:04:58.840] 大家都在关注她们，感觉她们就像是风头正劲。所以我想问问，你们还会怎么定义“It Girl”呢？我觉得没错，大家都在关注她们。她们似乎有一种与生俱来的吸引力。
[00:05:12.520] To like whatever they do and like they unintentionally influence others to kind of match their style or match their mannerisms I guess like for another Gen Z term I feel like if they have like stronger aura and then everyone just kind of like notices them, you know
[00:05:12.520] 不管他们做什么，都会不经意间影响到其他人，让他们模仿自己的风格或举止。我觉得用另一个Z世代的说法就是，如果他们气场更强，大家都会注意到他们，你知道的。
[00:05:26.440] Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing I was like they have a natural aura and I feel like growing up I kind of think about someone who's like admired by both genders in different ways
[00:05:26.440] 对，我也正想说这个，我觉得他们有一种与生俱来的气质，而且我觉得从小到大，我都会想，那种能以不同方式被男女双方欣赏的人，会是什么样子。
[00:05:36.480] Potentially like they have strong influence maybe both males and females and anyone in between I feel like usually they're defined by like certain characteristics to like either
[00:05:36.480] 他们可能拥有强大的影响力，或许对男性、女性以及介于两者之间的任何群体都有影响。我觉得他们通常会被某些特征所定义，比如……
[00:05:46.200] They're very good at a sport or like super talented in a certain way or they maybe present themselves in a way. That is very Admirable if I think about it girls growing up
[00:05:46.200] 她们在某项运动上非常出色，或者在某些方面极具天赋，又或者她们的形象塑造很独特。仔细想想，女孩们的成长过程中，这一点非常令人钦佩。
[00:05:56.240] I'm like, oh I really admired the way maybe they dress or like they did their hair and makeup Maybe certain things about them like really stood out Hmm, I totally resonate with that for like it girls in real life
[00:05:56.240] 我当时就想，哦，我真的很欣赏她们的穿衣风格，或者她们的发型和妆容。她们身上某些特质真的非常突出。嗯，我完全能理解现实生活中那些女孩的这种感受。
[00:06:07.640] but do you feel like there's a difference in like it girl in real life like someone you just know and then you think that They're really cool And then there's kind of like an artificial it girl
[00:06:07.640] 但你觉得现实生活中那种你认识的、觉得很酷的“It Girl”和那种人为打造的“It Girl”有什么区别吗？
[00:06:17.080] Aesthetic being pushed on like tick-tock or like Instagram and stuff like that, which in my mind is similar But doesn't necessarily capture the essence of like an IRL it girl Do you think you can name any like tick-tock it girls?
[00:06:17.080] 现在流行的审美方式就像TikTok或Instagram之类的社交媒体一样，在我看来，这和现实生活中的“It Girl”很相似，但并不一定能捕捉到她们的精髓。你能说出几个TikTok上的“It Girl”吗？
[00:06:31.000] Um, I feel like my 40 page doesn't have a lot of influencers anymore but I feel like there's like a or at least in New York where I am the it girl aesthetic probably
[00:06:31.000] 嗯，我觉得我那40页的博主好像没多少人关注了，但我觉得在纽约，至少在我这种风格的人里，还是挺流行的。
[00:06:42.600] Is really like slick back bun gold hoops white t-shirt type of aesthetic although I might be out of date. I'm not very But I feel like these people are trying to recreate probably like some Originator it girl and then just like starts this kind of trend
[00:06:42.600] 虽然我可能有点过时了，但感觉这种风格很像梳着油头、戴着金耳环、穿着白T恤的造型。我不太懂，但我觉得这些人可能是在模仿某个时尚达人的风格，然后就掀起了这种潮流。
[00:06:59.720] I think to me Alex Earl is Probably the it girl of this year last year and I was kind of thinking about it And I feel like what I like about seeing it girls nowadays is I don't think it's necessarily tied to what guys think
[00:06:59.720] 我觉得艾利克斯·厄尔可能是今年的当红女星，去年我就一直在想这个问题。我觉得现在我喜欢看到这些当红女星的一点是，她们的走红并不一定取决于男生的看法。
[00:07:15.500] I feel like it's very much so formed around the female opinion and I kind of love that it's independent from men because so much of what we're subjected to I feel like is male-dominated
[00:07:15.500] 我觉得它很大程度上是以女性视角构建的，我很喜欢它独立于男性之外这一点，因为我们所接触的很多东西我觉得都是男性主导的。
[00:07:27.540] But the it girl is truly like for the girlies like we picked Alex Earl or like we handpicked whoever is the it girl So it makes me feel more unified with the girls almost I'm gonna be honest, I don't know who Alex Earl is
[00:07:27.540] 但“It Girl”这个称号对女生来说真的就像是我们挑选了Alex Earl，或者说是我们精心挑选了某个It Girl一样。这让我感觉和女生们更加团结了。说实话，我根本不知道Alex Earl是谁。
[00:07:42.380] I'm clearly not part of it girl talk But do you feel like Alex girl got it girl status because she's like really conventionally attractive as well I think her popularity with the opposite sex is like something that propelled her to be more it girl worthy
[00:07:42.380] 我显然不参与女生之间的闲聊，但你觉得艾利克斯之所以能成为“It Girl”，是因为她长得也很符合传统审美吗？我觉得她在异性中的人气让她更配得上“It Girl”这个称号。
[00:07:58.500] So in a way, it's it kind of feels like she's the it girl because she's the best at doing the male standard That's the sense that I get I think I can see that but I just feel like she's not very popular with guys
[00:07:58.500] 所以从某种程度上来说，感觉她像是当红女星，因为她最擅长符合男性审美标准。我就是这种感觉，我觉得我能理解，但我感觉她不太受男生欢迎。
[00:08:10.420] And I feel like she's very authentic and post about her journey with acne and like Accutane and all that stuff I feel like it's really her authenticity and genuineness that kind of propelled her forward
[00:08:10.420] 我觉得她非常真实，会分享自己与痤疮作斗争的经历，比如服用异维A酸等等，我觉得正是她的这种真实和坦诚推动了她前进。
[00:08:22.380] But I think you're right like at the base of it to be an it girl You probably have to at least be like conventionally attractive. So what does she do on tik-tok? She posted like her college life of going to University of Miami
[00:08:22.380] 但我认为你说得对，要想成为网红，最基本的就是你至少得符合传统审美。那么她在TikTok上都发些什么呢？她发了一些她在迈阿密大学的大学生活视频。
[00:08:35.900] And then she got really big because she would post really honestly about like partying and like sorority life Acne all that stuff and then she'll post like her dirty room and be like, oh I have to clean shit
[00:08:35.900] 然后她就火了，因为她会很坦诚地发一些关于派对、姐妹会生活、痘痘之类的照片，然后她还会发一些她脏兮兮的房间的照片，然后说，哦，我得打扫卫生了。
[00:08:46.700] Just like stuff that's very normal and like day to day that people don't always post about I'll have to look into her later Do some research on the Gen Z a girl But I do agree with what everyone is saying I think you're right
[00:08:46.700] 就像一些很正常、很日常的事情，人们通常不会发到网上。我之后会好好了解一下她，做一些关于Z世代女孩的研究。但我同意大家的说法，我觉得你说得对。
[00:09:01.060] There does have to be a certain level of pull like you all mentioned from both genders But maybe leaning a little more for like the girls because in my mind like an it girl
[00:09:01.060] 确实需要像你们提到的那样，男女双方都有一定的吸引力，但也许更偏向女生一些，因为在我看来，一个“It Girl”应该具备这样的特质。
[00:09:12.140] starts trends whether they mean to or not and I feel like these trends happen with the gender associated with the girl Yeah, I'm thinking about other it girls that maybe also somewhat stemmed from tik-tok fame
[00:09:12.140] 她们无论有意无意都会引领潮流，我觉得这些潮流往往与女孩的性别有关。是的，我想到了一些其他的“It Girl”，她们的走红或许也与TikTok有关。
[00:09:24.820] Like I don't know if any of you follow like Matilda girl for like Sofia Richie I feel like they were also kind of in the same realm of Alex Earl and that like they're conventionally attractive
[00:09:24.820] 我不知道你们有没有人关注Matilda Girl或者Sofia Richie，我觉得她们和Alex Earl有点像，都是那种传统意义上的美女。
[00:09:35.860] but I think a lot of their following comes from the girlies and it's because they're kind of like fashion icon or They start trends that kind of become very viral I feel like I learned about
[00:09:35.860] 但我认为她们的粉丝大多是女生，因为她们有点像时尚偶像，或者她们引领的潮流很容易迅速走红。我觉得我了解到……
[00:09:47.940] Matilda girth and like her entire like clothing brand because I feel like everyone kept calling her like the it girl for like new Style and trends and like a lot of her she's obviously from Europe
[00:09:47.940] 玛蒂尔达的身材，还有她整个服装品牌，感觉大家都叫她“潮流引领者”，引领着新的时尚和潮流，而且她显然来自欧洲。
[00:09:58.080] But I think her influence was very happy in New York within the fashion scenes So I feel like even though they might have some slight influence across both genders
[00:09:58.080] 但我认为她在纽约时尚圈的影响力非常大。所以我觉得，即使她们对男女两性都有一定的影响力，
[00:10:07.300] I think most of the virality comes from girlies following them and like leading into their trends that they started. Mm-hmm Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, dude I also just had a thought because we've been discussing mostly like it girls within the tik-tok space
[00:10:07.300] 我觉得大部分爆款都来自女生们的追捧，她们喜欢并引领她们开创的潮流。嗯，没错，很有道理。我刚才也想到一点，因为我们一直在讨论TikTok上那些喜欢玩梗的女生。
[00:10:21.580] But I was thinking about like it girls over the past few years And I feel like one maybe more like specific it girl for a group is Kpop people so I was starting to think about like I don't know like Jennie
[00:10:21.580] 但我一直在想过去几年里那些当红女团成员，我觉得在K-pop圈子里，可能有一个更具体的“it girl”，所以我就开始想，比如Jennie。
[00:10:35.220] Blackpink and that's kind of like an it girl group And then also that kind of feeds into whole thing where kpop kind of tries to manufacture it girls and then that's part of the Virality and like popularity that they lean on to get their groups big
[00:10:35.220] Blackpink 算是当红女团吧。这也间接反映了 K-pop 圈打造“当红女团”的趋势，而这正是他们用来提升组合人气和影响力的关键所在。
[00:10:52.080] I think it's really true that like different spheres will have different it girls We have been mentioning to talk but I feel like back when Instagram was more popular I feel like there was a whole other
[00:10:52.080] 我觉得不同领域确实会有不同的“It Girl”。我们之前也提过要聊聊这个，但我觉得在Instagram更流行的时候，好像存在着完全不同的另一番景象。
[00:11:00.660] Cast of like people who are really popular on Instagram and then people who are really popular on YouTube Maybe certain like makeup gurus or something like that Like maybe they can be considered it girls in like their space true and not to throw it back
[00:11:00.660] 一群在Instagram上很火的人，还有在YouTube上很火的人，也许是一些美妆博主之类的，她们或许可以被认为是各自领域里的风云人物，而且她们的影响力不容小觑。
[00:11:13.920] Super old or anything but tumblr it girls. Oh my god I just remember this one account Jasmine blue and she would post the most like coquette stuff with bows on her socks and all of that and
[00:11:13.920] 虽然很老，但绝对是 Tumblr 上的风云人物。我的天哪，我突然想起一个叫 Jasmine blue 的账号，她会发一些特别妩媚的东西，比如袜子上系着蝴蝶结什么的。
[00:11:24.480] She to me was like the it girl from that era. Oh my god tumblr it girls are so funny It would be like all these photos of themselves and then like Moody as fuck quote picture
[00:11:24.480] 在我看来，她就像是那个时代的It Girl。天哪，Tumblr上的It Girl们太搞笑了！她们会发很多自己的照片，然后配上一张表情包，上面写着一些“情绪化极了”之类的语录。
[00:11:43.000] Times are simpler back then. Yeah, actually I feel like now that tick tock has like this slideshow feature or when they've created the slideshow I was like, I literally feel like we're back at like Cuz there was that like whole phase of like all these like sad
[00:11:43.000] 以前的日子更简单。是啊，其实我觉得现在 TikTok 有了幻灯片功能，或者说他们开发出幻灯片功能之后，我感觉我们好像又回到了以前那种……因为之前有过一段……很悲伤的时期。
[00:11:56.680] Quote II type of slideshows. I was like dude, this is like I Guess so many slideshows now I'm also thinking back tumblr days Like you mentioned I feel like one of the original it girls was Serena van der woods in from Gossip Girl
[00:11:56.680] 引用 II 型幻灯片。我当时就想，老兄，这感觉就像……我想现在这么多幻灯片，我也想起了 Tumblr 时代。就像你说的，我觉得《绯闻女孩》里的 Serena van der Woods 算是最早的 It Girl 之一。
[00:12:14.540] True. I didn't watch Gossip Girl when I was coming out Okay, based on a few seasons that I've watched now. I feel like Blair is more it girl, right? Oh, that's the big argument it's you know, very split between Blair fans and Serena
[00:12:14.540] 没错。我出柜的时候没看过《绯闻女孩》。好吧，就我目前看的几季来看，我觉得布莱尔更像个“It Girl”，对吧？哦，这就是最大的争议点，你知道，布莱尔的粉丝和瑟琳娜的粉丝之间争论非常激烈。
[00:12:31.860] Interesting interesting interesting. All right, I will say I'm a Blair fan, but I'm kind of leaning towards Serena being the it girl in the Gossip Girl world because I feel like what makes someone an it girl in my mind is
[00:12:31.860] 真有意思，真有意思，真有意思。好吧，我承认我是布莱尔的粉丝，但我感觉瑟琳娜才是《绯闻女孩》里的“It Girl”，因为我觉得在我看来，一个“It Girl”应该具备的特质是……
[00:12:45.300] They can't be chasing an aesthetic themselves sort of like their aesthetic is true to them And I feel like Blair pushes a certain look but Serena is kind of like nonchalant about it
[00:12:45.300] 她们自己不能刻意追求某种美学，因为她们的美学应该忠于自我。我觉得布莱尔很注重某种风格，但塞雷娜对此却显得漫不经心。
[00:12:55.620] She's like, oh and everyone's just like throw something on and then she gets popped and it's like in the papers or whatever True the effortlessness of it all
[00:12:55.620] 她就像，哦，然后大家就随便穿了件衣服，结果就被爆出丑闻，报纸上都登出来了什么的。这一切都显得那么毫不费力。
[00:13:05.540] Yeah, I think that's a big feature too I think especially in social media heavy world where everyone's kind of pushing an aesthetic I feel like sometimes it Seems like everyone's not dressing in an outfit. Everyone's like kind of dressing the character or like putting on a costume almost
[00:13:05.540] 是的，我觉得这也是个很大的特点，尤其是在社交媒体盛行的今天，每个人都在努力打造某种审美，我感觉有时候好像大家穿的不是衣服，而是角色扮演或者戏服。
[00:13:20.340] Yeah, so I feel like the it girl Transcends beyond that creates their own path agreed. But besides like the it girl. Do you think there's other archetypes Slash characterizations of women that we're seeing more of because I feel like back in the day, you know
[00:13:20.340] 是的，我觉得“It Girl”超越了这种类型，开创了自己的道路，我同意。但除了“It Girl”之外，你觉得现在还有哪些女性原型或角色塑造方式比较常见？因为我觉得以前，你知道的
[00:13:38.140] It's mainly just like the it girl But now I feel like with social media and just like the internet being so big there's definitely more Archetypes one of the ones that we named was like bra girl. So is there anything else?
[00:13:38.140] 以前主要就是那种“It Girl”之类的形象。但现在我觉得，随着社交媒体和互联网的普及，肯定出现了更多类型的女性形象，我们之前提到的一个就是“内衣女孩”。还有其他的吗？
[00:13:52.260] I guess like what is your for you page catered towards? What kind of girl are you? I feel like answering your first question. I think there's definitely a proliferation of all these different kinds of aesthetics and labels and like archetypes, I don't know exactly
[00:13:52.260] 我想问的是，你的“为你推荐”页面是面向哪种类型的女孩？你是哪种类型的女孩？我想先回答你的第一个问题。我觉得现在各种不同的审美、标签和原型层出不穷，但我也不太清楚具体是什么。
[00:14:09.620] Why that is I have like a few theories like one of them is it's basically like that meme It's like oh like when you turn 30 you can choose between craft beer or like I don't know something else as your personality
[00:14:09.620] 我之所以会这样，有几个理论，其中一个就是，这基本上就像那个梗图一样，就像当你30岁的时候，你可以选择精酿啤酒或者其他什么东西来代表你的个性。
[00:14:19.940] it's like you can just choose one of these laid-out characters to be your personality and then Everyone on the internet will give you suggestions. What you should wear is the books you should read the aesthetic should carry You don't have to do that much
[00:14:19.940] 就像你可以从这些预设好的角色中选择一个来代表你的个性，然后互联网上的每个人都会给你提建议。你应该穿什么衣服，应该读什么书，应该注重什么风格，你都不需要做太多。
[00:14:34.020] Independent thought to kind of forge your own path in that regard You can just kind of pick an aesthetic and be like, all right And I feel like the plus side of us I guess like really convenient
[00:14:34.020] 独立思考，在这方面可以开辟自己的道路。你可以选择一种美学风格，然后说，好吧。我觉得我们这样做的好处是，真的很方便。
[00:14:44.460] I think the negative side of that is like I feel like it encourages people to put you in a box, right? Like oh, I'm gonna be cottagecore aesthetic girly and then people will look at that and be like, okay
[00:14:44.460] 我觉得这样做的负面影响在于，它似乎会让人们给你贴标签，对吧？比如，哦，我要走田园风少女风，然后人们看到后就会想，好吧。
[00:14:55.940] Like she's caught a course that I kind of like get to know her really I know she's gonna like this and know she's gonna do that and then it kind of just allows you to have like a more shallow person a box type of interaction
[00:14:55.940] 感觉她选了个课程，我挺想真正了解她，知道她会喜欢这个，会做那个，然后这种课程就让你只能跟一个比较肤浅的人进行那种形式式的互动。
[00:15:06.500] I don't know if that makes sense. But like yeah, I think that makes total sense. We're just categorizing people now Yeah, you're like playing one of those like video games. You like choose a character. Yeah, that's your that's your class
[00:15:06.500] 我不知道这样说你能不能理解。但是，嗯，我觉得完全说得通。我们现在只是在给人们分类而已。对，就像玩那种电子游戏一样。你选择一个角色。对，那就是你的阶级。
[00:15:18.100] You're like this is the group that I want to become friends with so I'm now cottagecore Yeah, I feel like there's probably like a marketing aspect to it as well I feel like it's easier for companies to kind of push an aesthetic and then
[00:15:18.100] 你会觉得，这就是我想结交的朋友群体，所以我现在也喜欢田园风了。嗯，我觉得这可能也有营销的成分，我觉得公司更容易推广某种美学风格。
[00:15:31.860] Position themselves in such a way that they're best suited to fulfill that aesthetic You know just like carve out niches in the market that way, but that's like a hyper cynical I think your theory about like
[00:15:31.860] 他们会把自己定位成最适合满足那种审美需求的方式，你知道，就像那样在市场上开辟利基市场，但我觉得你的理论有点过于愤世嫉俗了。
[00:15:43.980] having less independent thought and like kind of almost having like a guideline or like a rubric to follow is very true because I think if you very much like like or Admire a certain aesthetic or you see that a lot
[00:15:43.980] 缺乏独立思考，更像是遵循某种准则或规则，这种说法非常正确，因为我认为，如果你非常喜欢或欣赏某种美学，或者你经常看到这种美学，那么你很可能会受到它的影响。
[00:15:59.600] I think part of you just like wants to be part of that and if a lot of things are already outlined for you Like oh you should wear your hair way or like have
[00:15:59.600] 我觉得你内心深处其实也想成为其中的一份子，如果很多事情都已经为你安排好了，比如，哦，你应该梳什么样的发型，或者……
[00:16:08.420] This kind of makeup or like dress the style in order to like fit in with this aesthetic in a way maybe Identity wise you feel some level of achievement almost like oh I can fit in with these types of people that I really admire
[00:16:08.420] 这种妆容或穿衣风格，是为了融入某种审美，或许从身份认同的角度来看，你会感到某种程度的成就感，就像“哦，我终于可以融入我真正欣赏的这类人群了”。
[00:16:23.860] Again, I don't have to think so freely about like Oh how I should wear my hair every day or like what brands or like types of clothing I should wear And I don't think there's any like necessarily cons to that
[00:16:23.860] 再说，我不用每天都费心去想“哦，我该怎么打理头发”或者“我该穿什么牌子、什么类型的衣服”之类的事情。我觉得这没什么不好。
[00:16:33.980] I think it can become part of your personal style and like that is ever-changing so it's very interesting to me to like see how these different archetypes continue to evolve as we as like social media trends grow or like I
[00:16:33.980] 我认为它可以成为你个人风格的一部分，而个人风格又在不断变化，所以对我来说，观察这些不同的原型如何随着社交媒体趋势的发展而不断演变，非常有趣。
[00:16:47.140] Don't know. I feel like back then there was like the emo girl and that was really cool and like middle school, but now I'm like Hardly ever see that but maybe it's just cuz like that's not
[00:16:47.140] 不知道。感觉以前中学的时候，那种emo女孩特别酷，但现在几乎看不到了，可能是因为那种风格已经过时了吧。
[00:16:57.540] What's trending on like social media or like other platforms and like people around me? Yeah I think it's interesting Too because I totally agree about like you feel a sense of achievement to try to fit in with people that you admire
[00:16:57.540] 社交媒体或其他平台上，以及我周围的人都在讨论什么？我觉得这很有意思，因为我完全同意，努力融入你崇拜的人的圈子，会让你获得一种成就感。
[00:17:08.860] I think the other angle of that is like the authenticity part that you mentioned earlier because I feel like There's probably a really quick trend cycle now because it's like some aesthetic emerges
[00:17:08.860] 我认为另一个角度就像你之前提到的真实性问题，因为我觉得现在的潮流更迭可能非常快，就像某种审美观念迅速出现一样。
[00:17:20.620] People really want to emulate it and then other people are like, oh but then it's not authentic It's just like you're just copying everyone and the new style emerges and then like the more styles there are
[00:17:20.620] 人们真的很想模仿它，然后其他人就会说，哦，但那样就不正宗了。就好像你在抄袭所有人一样，然后新的风格出现了，之后风格就越来越多了。
[00:17:30.980] And the more easier of a rubric there is I feel like this the trend cycles just get faster and faster I think my brain also kind of goes to
[00:17:30.980] 而且我觉得，规则越简单，趋势周期就越快，我的大脑似乎也开始这样运转了。
[00:17:39.300] these aesthetics living in relativity of each other so, you know if we were to all live in a vacuum and Not see other people and etc I feel like you would truly be like your own self, but because we're constantly interacting with people looking at different content
[00:17:39.300] 这些审美观彼此相对，所以，你知道，如果我们都生活在一个真空里，看不到其他人等等，我觉得你才会真正做回自己。但因为我们不断地与人互动，观看不同的内容，所以情况并非如此。
[00:17:54.420] I feel like you're forced to kind of pick a lane and in some ways. I think people could be Pressured to fit into the most common label that they see for example, but then in other ways
[00:17:54.420] 我觉得你好像被迫选择一条路，在某种程度上是这样。我认为人们可能会迫于压力去符合他们看到的最常见的标签，但另一方面，在其他方面……
[00:18:05.220] I feel like you might be drawn to something that feels a little bit more unique like oh everyone else is Chasing VSCO girl aesthetic like maybe I should be the bruh girl or something. So I feel like it's all relative, right?
[00:18:05.220] 我觉得你可能会被一些更独特的东西吸引，比如“哦，大家都在追捧VSCO女孩的风格，那我也许应该走‘兄弟女孩’路线之类的”。所以我觉得这一切都是相对的，对吧？
[00:18:15.060] It's like what is my personality or what is my look relative to other people's and do I want to be the unique person? Or do I want to be like the common folk? No, I think I think what you're saying is true there's like a natural equilibrium
[00:18:15.060] 这就像在问，我的个性和外貌与其他人相比如何？我想成为独一无二的人吗？还是想成为普通人？不，我觉得你说的有道理，这其中存在一种自然的平衡。
[00:18:32.020] Yeah, and I feel like it's super different based on the culture of the country, too I can see in maybe more like homogeneous populations like in Asia or something Maybe you want to fit into what everyone else is doing and then maybe in America
[00:18:32.020] 是的，我觉得这很大程度上取决于国家的文化。在像亚洲那样人口构成比较单一的国家，人们可能更倾向于融入群体，比如在美国。
[00:18:44.860] There's that added layer of we should seek out uniqueness and you know find our true selves So then it's more complexity on top of that. Do you feel like you have a different? Aesthetic or even personality based on like where you are so for example
[00:18:44.860] 还有一层额外的含义，那就是我们应该追求独特性，找到真正的自我。所以，这就让事情变得更加复杂了。你觉得自己的审美甚至个性会因为所处的环境而有所不同吗？例如……
[00:19:02.900] When we're like home in California or when you're in school Which might not be where home is or when you're like living in New York like Mel I think for me, yes, and I think it also depends on
[00:19:02.900] 当我们身处加州家中，或者你在学校（那里可能不是你的家），又或者像梅尔一样住在纽约时，我想对我来说，是的，而且我认为这还取决于……
[00:19:17.980] The people that I'm with too and kind of like what the group of people needs or something You know, like there's like some sort of balance right like two different personality types. It can't be all the same personality type
[00:19:17.980] 我身边的人也一样，他们也挺喜欢这个群体的需求，你知道，就像需要某种平衡一样，两种不同的性格类型。不可能全是同一种性格类型。
[00:19:30.420] so then I feel like depending on what I feel is needed like Different qualities of me come out or like I set certain qualities aside Actually, I feel like that's a good point I feel like some of my college friends and I have discussed
[00:19:30.420] 所以我觉得，根据我的需要，我的不同特质就会展现出来，或者我会把某些特质暂时搁置。实际上，我觉得你说的很有道理。我和一些大学朋友也讨论过这个问题。
[00:19:44.540] Something kind of similar where it's like some people are better at taking charge in planning than others. So depending on the group that You're in like you might be the person who is best at taking charge and then you'll take charge or
[00:19:44.540] 情况有点类似，有些人比其他人更擅长领导规划工作。所以，根据你所在的团队，你可能就是最擅长领导的人，然后你就会负责领导，或者
[00:19:57.580] Your other friend might be better and then you'll just like defer to them and then there's I don't say hierarchy Like I know these people are better at like planning stuff than I am and I know these people would prefer if I plan it
[00:19:57.580] 你的另一个朋友可能更擅长，那样的话你就得听他们的，而且这里也存在着等级观念，我不是说要分清高低。我知道这些人比我更擅长计划，我也知道他们更希望我来计划。
[00:20:08.260] So I feel like depending on the group that I'm in my active or passive role Switches. Hmm. So like cottagecore girl gets to plan the cabin trip Cottagecore girl can plan the activities at the cabin trip
[00:20:08.260] 所以我觉得，根据我所在的群体，我的角色会从积极扮演转变为消极扮演。嗯。比如，田园风女孩可以负责策划小屋之旅，也可以负责策划小屋之旅中的活动。
[00:20:23.380] But then the cabin trip itself probably should be planned by like the not chill girl, you know CEO boss girl They have like they have different we have different roles It's really interesting because I feel like sometimes you might fall into like a certain archetype
[00:20:23.380] 但是，这次小木屋之旅本身可能应该由那种不拘小节的女孩来计划，你知道，就是那种CEO女强人。她们扮演着不同的角色，我们也有不同的角色。这真的很有意思，因为我觉得有时候你可能会不自觉地陷入某种特定的角色模式。
[00:20:44.380] Based on like maybe the look you're going for but your personality might not exactly match that so I kind of feel like it's it's this strange dichotomy of like visually, I might look like an AVG, but I feel like I
[00:20:44.380] 这可能取决于你想要打造的形象，但你的个性可能并不完全匹配，所以我感觉这是一种奇怪的矛盾：从外表上看，我可能看起来像个普通人，但我觉得我
[00:20:57.340] More closely align my personality and like type to I don't know if a chill girl or the boss Because I do think that like sometimes you might be like into certain trends that fall into like an archetype but
[00:20:57.340] 更贴近我的个性和喜好类型，我不知道是随和的女孩还是强势的女强人。因为我确实认为，有时候你可能会喜欢某些符合某种原型类型的潮流，但是
[00:21:10.820] Your personality is a little bit more fixed. I think then like you're kind of like external appearance in certain ways So I'm trying to think through like Sunny's the CEO AVG Literally neither of them. She's the CEO of all AVG We are all her board members I
[00:21:10.820] 你的性格比较固定。我觉得你在某些方面很注重外表。所以我在想，Sunny是AVG的CEO，实际上他们都不是。她是AVG的CEO，我们都是她的董事会成员。
[00:21:41.020] Do have one thought though I don't know if this is maybe just me or the influence of social media or something but a lot of these characterizations of women especially like
[00:21:41.020] 不过我确实有一点想法，我不知道这是否只是我个人的感觉，还是社交媒体或其他因素的影响，但很多对女性的刻画，尤其是像……
[00:21:51.860] Fisco girl or bra girl like all of these things I feel are very geared towards women in a specific age bracket That maybe we are Slightly aging out of so then now that I look at these as like a late 20s women I'm like, okay
[00:21:51.860] 像Fisco girl或者bra girl之类的，我觉得这些东西都特别针对特定年龄段的女性，而我们可能正在慢慢告别那个年龄段。所以现在我作为20多岁的女性再看这些东西，就会觉得，好吧。
[00:22:09.220] This is like me when I was in high school or maybe me in college or like me before 25 And now that I'm past 25 I feel like I am more cemented in my personality and maybe a little bit less
[00:22:09.220] 这感觉就像我高中时，或者大学时，或者25岁之前的我。现在我过了25岁，感觉自己的性格更加稳定，也许也少了一些变化。
[00:22:19.420] Subjected to these micro trends in terms of how it affects me like internally So then why do you think we care about women in this certain age bracket so much? Like why are there so many words to define them and characterize them? You know what I mean?
[00:22:19.420] 这些微趋势对我的内心影响很大，所以我就深受其影响。那么，你觉得我们为什么如此关注这个年龄段的女性？为什么有那么多词语来定义和描述她们？你明白我的意思吗？
[00:22:33.340] Actually, I do have a bit of a theory on this This is the age where you have the least amount of responsibility and the world has not crushed you yet So So we can observe how these younger people are, you know defining themselves
[00:22:33.340] 其实，我对此确实有点想法。这个年纪责任最轻，世界还没把你压垮。所以我们可以观察这些年轻人是如何定义自己的。
[00:22:51.940] How what they think is cool But then so I'm thinking you know us and like people who are a little older who are you know starting to become moms You know, they have all these additional responsibilities like imagine
[00:22:51.940] 她们觉得什么很酷？但我想，你知道，我们这些年纪稍长、开始当妈妈的人，她们肩负着很多额外的责任，就像……
[00:23:06.380] Taking care of a screaming child and at the same time you're like, oh my god I need to worry about like what is in and what I need to wear So for them, it's like oh, okay. Like what's the it girl wearing? Like what's trendy now that way?
[00:23:06.380] 一边照顾哭闹的孩子，一边还得操心穿搭，天哪，我得想想现在流行什么，自己该穿什么。所以对他们来说，就好像是，哦，好吧。比如，现在最潮的女孩穿什么？现在流行什么？
[00:23:20.860] I don't have to think and I can focus on my like responsibilities. So that's just my theory Like I think people of that age probably spend the most time on social media
[00:23:20.860] 我不用动脑筋，可以专注于我的职责。这只是我的看法。我觉得那个年龄段的人可能花最多时间在社交媒体上。
[00:23:33.300] So I think just like as a product of how much time they spend they can make the definitions a lot more granular And I also think that like us women over 25. We definitely do have different archetypes
[00:23:33.300] 所以我觉得，正是因为他们投入的时间越多，他们就能把定义做得更加细致。而且我也觉得，像我们这些25岁以上的女性，我们肯定有不同的原型。
[00:23:46.740] They're just not like maybe the same ones as like below 25 like the drug girl chill party girl, whatever I feel like it kind of adjust a little bit more. Yeah, I think I'd agree with that
[00:23:46.740] 她们跟那些25岁以下的吸毒女孩、派对女孩之类的不太一样，我觉得她们的风格更多元化一些。嗯，我同意。
[00:23:56.900] I feel like sometimes when you're in your teens and then going into college and maybe even a little bit post grad You're still kind of like figuring out who you are
[00:23:56.900] 我觉得有时候，当你十几岁，然后上大学，甚至毕业后一段时间，你仍然在摸索自己是谁。
[00:24:05.620] And I think that goes with like the people you surround yourself with maybe even like your career and like also the kind of like characterization you want to Like identify yourself with so I feel like there's just so much change
[00:24:05.620] 我觉得这跟你身边的人，甚至你的职业，还有你想把自己塑造成什么样的人都有关系，所以我觉得变化真的很大。
[00:24:20.700] Happening during those years and that kind of leads to having so many different types of girls or like these types of micro labels But I do think that post 25 and even like crystal I think you just described being on as an example
[00:24:20.700] 那些年发生的事情，导致出现了各种各样的女孩，或者说出现了各种微型厂牌。但我确实认为，25岁以后，甚至像Crystal那样，你刚才举的例子，就是她当时的情况。
[00:24:36.300] I still feel like there are certain types Going into like your 30s and beyond just that your life might be a lot more stable or hopefully maybe Could be more stable then so maybe the characterizations or these archetypes are like a lot more streamlined
[00:24:36.300] 我仍然觉得，到了30岁及以后，某些类型的人会变得更加稳定，或者说，希望能够更加稳定，所以这些人物形象或原型可能会更加精简。
[00:24:52.500] They're not as out there or there aren't as many categories, but I still think that to a certain extent like you might see certain people on social media and Still be able to like identify with them and fall into certain like
[00:24:52.500] 它们不像其他群体那样普遍，或者说类别没有那么多，但我仍然认为，在某种程度上，你可能会在社交媒体上看到某些人，仍然能够认同他们，并归入某些特定群体。
[00:25:07.580] Categories as you age. I think that makes sense And I wonder if a part of it too is maybe at that age You're a little bit more insecure as a person and you're more I don't want to say vulnerable
[00:25:07.580] 随着年龄增长，你的性格类型也会发生变化。我觉得这很有道理。而且我也在想，是不是因为到了那个年纪，你会变得更加缺乏安全感，也更加……我不想用“脆弱”这个词。
[00:25:20.380] But you are more of like open to seeking out these like new characterization types of like oh Where could I fit in versus when you're older like you said crystal? It's like less and less of a priority almost to like try to align to one of those things
[00:25:20.380] 但你现在更乐于尝试这些新的角色塑造方式，比如“我能融入哪个角色？”，而不是像你说的，克里斯托尔，年纪大了之后，就越来越不那么在意是否符合某种既定的角色类型了。
[00:25:32.900] but I think the other half of me also wonders if There is just more scrutiny and more attention paid to women in that age bracket So like maybe teenage girls slash like early 20s girls because I remember at least me growing up
[00:25:32.900] 但我内心深处也在想，是不是因为这个年龄段的女性更容易受到审视和关注？比如十几岁的女孩或者二十出头的女孩，因为至少我记得我自己的成长经历。
[00:25:48.300] I used to like really fangirl over certain idol groups And I remember in the Korean media There was always like this thing about oh like these fangirls like these fangirls have so many issues blah blah but then I would think about
[00:25:48.300] 我以前特别迷某些偶像团体。我记得韩国媒体总是说这些女粉丝有很多问题等等，但后来我想……
[00:26:02.940] Teenage guys my age at the time like really being fans of like sports teams or something, right? But that was never an issue It was only an issue that teenage girls were fangirling over idol groups
[00:26:02.940] 当时和我同龄的男生都很喜欢追星，比如喜欢某个运动队什么的，对吧？但这从来都不是问题。真正的问题是，少女们疯狂迷恋偶像团体。
[00:26:14.660] But whoever the guys were fanning over like they didn't care or like scrutinize. So I think growing up I always wondered why does society care so much about like girls of this age? When they don't pay nearly enough attention to guys that age
[00:26:14.660] 但那些男生却好像对谁都漠不关心，或者说，他们根本不会仔细审视她们。所以我从小就一直很疑惑，为什么社会如此关注这个年龄段的女孩？而对同龄的男生却关注甚少。
[00:26:29.260] Whoa, wait, that's crazy because now that I think about it Like we have a lot of different categories that we've been describing this whole time but Not to shit on guys But I feel like for guys if there's like one popular haircut
[00:26:29.260] 哇，等等，这太疯狂了，因为现在想想，我们一直在描述很多不同的类别，但并不是要贬低男生，但我觉得如果男生有一种很流行的发型……
[00:26:45.060] Every single guy will get it and then like not to say there's just one but there's like Much more limited archetypes within the male space that we see on externally Versus like what we're aware of within the like girl space
[00:26:45.060] 每个男人都会明白这一点，而且，我不是说只有一种类型，但男性领域中我们看到的外部形象原型要有限得多，相比之下，我们所知的女性领域则截然不同。
[00:27:00.740] Do you feel like that's cuz we're not guys so we don't know the details of it Like I feel like if we asked a guy they would be like, what is cottage court?
[00:27:00.740] 你觉得这是因为我们不是男生，所以不了解细节吗？我觉得如果我们问一个男生，他们会说，什么是乡村别墅？
[00:27:11.700] Think I would agree with that. Yeah, I feel like the guys also discuss it. Yeah, that's fair. We're not broad girl enough That's fair, I guess like we just see from the external point of view what the it boy is so like right now
[00:27:11.700] 我觉得我同意。是啊，我觉得男生们也会讨论这个。嗯，有道理。我们不够开放包容。这说得通，我想我们只是从旁观者的角度来看待现在的当红男星。
[00:27:27.540] It's I don't know mullets or like middle part Yeah, I agree with you say like I think there is a lot of scrutiny on What teenage girls and like young women like and don't like and what they're like? I don't want to like make a very sad point
[00:27:27.540] 我不知道，是鲻鱼头还是中分之类的发型。是的，我同意你的看法，我觉得现在人们对十几岁女孩和年轻女性的喜好和性格有很多关注。我不想说一些令人难过的话。
[00:27:43.860] But I think a little bit of it is like misogyny like things that teenage girls like just tend to be Ridicule and stuff like that like boys can like rock bands or whatever But if girls really like Taylor Swift and it's kind of cringe or whatever
[00:27:43.860] 但我认为这其中有点厌女的成分，比如少女喜欢的东西往往会被嘲笑之类的。男孩可以喜欢摇滚乐队什么的，但如果女孩真的喜欢泰勒·斯威夫特，就会被认为很尴尬什么的。
[00:27:56.140] All this stuff is like taking really trivially even though it's not fundamentally different than what other people do And I think that makes me feel like complicated feelings about these micro labels because I think in a positive light I can look at this and be like Oh
[00:27:56.140] 所有这些都像是被轻描淡写地看待，尽管它本质上与其他人做的事情并无不同。我觉得这让我对这些微小的标签产生了复杂的情感，因为从积极的角度来看，我可以这样想：哦
[00:28:13.260] If I really wanted to like I have all these options laid out in front of me and it makes it easier Right, like we mentioned earlier like there's a rubric already that exists. There's like a framework but then in another way I'm like I
[00:28:13.260] 如果我真的想做某件事，我面前摆着所有这些选择，这让事情变得更容易。对，就像我们之前提到的，已经有现成的准则了。有一个框架，但另一方面，我又觉得……
[00:28:25.740] Can't help but feel like we're dicing up these different personalities or maybe like these different aesthetics that people have Just so we can like pick a new micro label to like shit on kind of and not us by like as in like we
[00:28:25.740] 我不禁觉得，我们好像在把这些不同的个性，或者说这些不同的审美观，生怕我们自己挑出个新标签来贬低，而不是贬低我们自己，就像我们……
[00:28:39.380] But I feel like as a society There's constantly something female that is getting shit on and then by having all these micro labels I'm like, oh my god, like we're more vulnerable, which is not like the most positive way to look at it
[00:28:39.380] 但我感觉，作为一个社会，女性总是遭受各种攻击，然后又被贴上各种各样的标签，这让我觉得，天哪，我们好像更容易受到伤害了，但这并不是一种积极的看法。
[00:28:51.100] But I do feel like it is something that happens I think that goes back to what I was mentioning before. It's like also a way to like dismiss getting to know you It's like oh like they're just this kind of person because they dress like this or that
[00:28:51.100] 但我确实觉得这种情况确实会发生，我觉得这跟我之前提到的有点关系。这就像是一种拒绝了解你的方式，就好像他们会觉得，哦，他们只是因为穿成这样或那样就成了这种人。
[00:29:04.580] They follow this aesthetic or like whatever. That's like the disheartening aspect the positive aspect. Yeah, it's like it's kind of fun You can dress up your character in so many different ways Your character you mean yourself
[00:29:04.580] 他们遵循这种审美或者其他什么。这既是令人沮丧的一面，也是积极的一面。是的，这很有趣。你可以用很多不同的方式装扮你的角色。你的角色，你指的是你自己。
[00:29:18.620] But all this talk about like certain archetypes get shit on like for a period of time Really reminds me of like do you guys know Nara Smith on on tik-tok? She's basically this woman who will say shit like oh we ran out of toothpaste
[00:29:18.620] 但所有关于某些典型人物会被嘲讽一段时间的说法，真的让我想起了TikTok上的Nara Smith，你们认识她吗？她基本上就是那种会说“哦，我们牙膏用完了”这种蠢话的女人。
[00:29:34.580] So we decided to just make our own Whole like, you know segment of making it in her house and people are like you ran out of toothpaste But you have like one of these obscure ingredients available to make toothpaste when she like just like benzoyl peroxide
[00:29:34.580] 所以我们决定自己做牙膏，你知道，整个制作过程都在她家完成，然后人们会说你牙膏用完了，但你手头正好有像过氧化苯甲酰这种不常见的牙膏原料。
[00:29:53.220] Fluoride in her I Think like when she first started making videos, it's like somewhat authentic I think that she does truly do a lot of like cooking and things like that But people the initial reaction was just shitting on her like oh my god
[00:29:53.220] 我觉得她视频里加了氟化物，就像她刚开始做视频的时候那样，感觉还挺真实的，她确实做了很多烹饪之类的事情。但是人们最初的反应都是对她冷嘲热讽，简直无语。
[00:30:11.300] You're such a housewife like doing all this, you know Cooking from scratch and that kind of stuff but she powered through I guess and she kept posting and now it's like She's like really leaning into that whole thing where part of her Videos are more sarcastic now
[00:30:11.300] 你就像个家庭主妇，做着所有这些事，你知道，从零开始做饭什么的，但她坚持了下来，继续发帖，现在感觉她好像真的完全投入到那种风格里了，她的一些视频也变得更讽刺了。
[00:30:27.700] Like the toothpaste one was like kind of satirical almost She like plays into the joke a little bit more and now people like love her after she got through that initial bump of Criticism or I don't even know if it was necessarily criticism
[00:30:27.700] 就像牙膏那件事，感觉有点像讽刺。她似乎更乐于接受这个玩笑，现在人们都很喜欢她，因为她挺过了最初的批评阶段——或者我甚至不知道那算不算批评。
[00:30:43.260] It was more just like people hating on her but then at a certain point I started seeing comments being like You know what? Like I fucking get it now like like you fucking go to her Smith
[00:30:43.260] 一开始大家好像都在黑她，但后来我看到一些评论说，你知道吗？我他妈现在明白了，就像你他妈去支持她一样。
[00:30:54.220] And now she's like super popular in a positive way versus like the negative way in the beginning and I feel like there's just this like whiplash of
[00:30:54.220] 现在她的人气飙升，而且是正面的那种，跟一开始的负面评价完全不一样，我觉得这种转变就像是当头棒喝。
[00:31:04.060] You know one second you're being hated on for what you're doing and then the next second it's like cool and then you're like, okay Where was this positive?
[00:31:04.060] 你知道，前一秒你还在因为你做的事情而被人憎恨，下一秒就觉得很酷，然后你就会想，好吧，这积极的事情在哪儿呢？
[00:31:12.820] Reaction when I was doing it dude, it makes me think about you know how in Stardew Valley when you go and catch fish There's like a mini game so it's like a like a fishing rod and then you have to get your
[00:31:12.820] 我当时的反应，老兄，这让我想起了《星露谷物语》里钓鱼的那个小游戏，你知道的，就是用鱼竿钓鱼，然后你得……
[00:31:26.540] Marker in like a very specific range Otherwise the fish will run away and I feel like that's very much something that happens to female celebrities When you're on the rise You're like so cool
[00:31:26.540] 把标记放在一个非常具体的范围内，否则鱼就会游走。我觉得这种情况很常见于女明星，当你走红的时候，你会感觉自己酷毙了。
[00:31:38.340] And then you hit a certain point and then people love you like can't get enough and then once you pass that point of popularity You're like the person to go and shit on and
[00:31:38.340] 然后你达到某个阶段，人们会像永远也看不够似的爱你，但一旦你过了那个受欢迎程度的临界点，你就成了人们攻击的对象。
[00:31:48.900] I feel like I've seen that happen so much where it's like when you're on the rise like you can't say a single thing That's wrong. And then once you're past like the peak every time you open your mouth, it's like a controversy. I
[00:31:48.900] 我觉得这种情况我见过太多次了，就像当你事业蒸蒸日上的时候，你一句错话都不能说。而一旦你过了巅峰期，每次开口说话都会引发争议。
[00:32:00.820] Think I see that a lot as well. It's kind of like you're just basically breaching saturation I think you become too cool And then people the cooler thing to do is to hate on you and then the cycle restarts Everything is just like that trend cycle
[00:32:00.820] 我也经常看到这种情况。感觉就像你突破了饱和点，变得太酷了。然后人们觉得更酷的做法就是黑你，然后循环往复。一切都像这个潮流周期一样。
[00:32:14.980] but it's like if you're too cool then like people think that liking this person is just like not authentic and then like You're cooler for having an original thought of disliking this person That's true. And then it becomes cooler to have the original thought of liking them
[00:32:14.980] 但如果你太酷，别人就会觉得喜欢这个人很不真诚，然后你因为有“不喜欢这个人”这种独特想法而显得更酷。没错，这样一来，有“喜欢这个人”这种独特想法反而更酷了。
[00:32:31.980] Exactly exactly so don't worry I feel like in another six months and our Smith will get ridiculed again I Have a I have an activity for us to do if you could come up with like three words to describe your own archetype
[00:32:31.980] 没错，没错，别担心。我觉得再过六个月，我们的史密斯又要被嘲笑了。我有个活动想和你一起做，如果你能用三个词来描述一下你自己的原型的话。
[00:32:49.540] Whoa, just on the spot like that First way you go first shit harder Chill Okay, you know what I'm gonna reduce it down to two words How can I reduce my entire personality those two words Okay, sorry two to three words mine is literally not chill
[00:32:49.540] 哇，就这么突然就说了。你先走一步，先搞砸。冷静点。好吧，你知道吗，我要把它简化成两个词。我怎么能用这两个词来概括我的整个个性呢？好吧，抱歉，两到三个词，我的个性简直一点都不冷静。
[00:33:27.940] Aspirational a chill oh This is giving like describe yourself in three words. Oh my god That's literally that's kind of essentially what you asked Okay, actually how about this I'm gonna change the question How about we name two or three archetypes that we think we went through?
[00:33:27.940] 令人振奋的，有点冷，哦，这就像用三个词形容你自己。我的天哪，这基本上就是你问的那个问题。好吧，其实这样如何？我要换个问题。我们列举两到三种我们认为自己经历过的原型怎么样？
[00:33:56.340] Do you have a word bank? Oh, okay, so I guess there was like tumblr scene girl emo ABG chill not chill It girl girly girl bra girl VSCO girl Is there anything else that was like really popular cottagecore girl? We can't forget her
[00:33:56.340] 你有词库吗？哦，好吧，我猜当时有 Tumblr 上的“scene girl”、“emo girl”、“ABG”、“chill”、“not chill”、“It girl”、“girly girl”、“bra girl”、“VSCO girl”之类的词。还有其他像“cottagecore girl”这样很流行的词吗？我们不能忘记她。
[00:34:23.980] Dude manic pixie dream girl. Oh, that was like a niche but popular Oh My god, I actually learned a new term as well. This one's really funny it's by adjacent and it's basically like you've adopted some of the like fashion trends of like by people but you're
[00:34:23.980] 老兄，古灵精怪的梦中情人。哦，这好像是个小众但又很流行的词。我的天，我居然还学到了一个新词。这个词真的很有意思，是“相邻”这个词，基本上就是说你借鉴了一些别人的时尚潮流，但你……
[00:34:45.060] Unfortunately not by that's like this definition Unfortunately, you like Unfortunately, you're straight So that's also an Archetype like alt girl, I guess true. I think this question feels a lot easier now I think I had a bruh girl phase for sure when I was in my pick-me era
[00:34:45.060] 可惜不是，这跟这个定义不一样。可惜，你喜欢……可惜，你是直女。所以这也算是一种原型，就像另类女孩一样，我猜对了。我觉得现在这个问题更容易回答了。我肯定在我“求关注”时期有过一段“兄弟女孩”时期。
[00:35:10.020] So then that was a big one And then I feel like it kind of went into the party girl phase for a little bit Like, you know like the Paris Hilton like Lindsay Lohan like that kind of aesthetic And then now I'm seeking new aesthetics
[00:35:10.020] 所以那件事影响很大。然后我觉得我好像有一段时间进入了派对女孩的阶段，你知道，就像帕丽斯·希尔顿、林赛·罗翰那种风格。现在我正在寻找新的风格。
[00:35:25.700] Open to new role You're ready for your next role Yeah, I feel like I probably had a pretty girl phase as well, but now I feel like the by adjacent is kind of fitting I feel like certain aspects of the way I dress maybe or slightly but unfortunately
[00:35:25.700] 乐于接受新角色 你已经准备好迎接下一个角色了 是的，我觉得我可能也经历过一段“漂亮女孩”的时期，但现在我觉得“相邻”这个词挺适合我的。我觉得我穿衣打扮的某些方面可能有点，或者说略微有点，但可惜的是
[00:35:51.140] Just resonate with that part Like I think piercings is like a big one too for the like that fashion niche Yeah I feel like I see a lot of comedy content on tik-tok where it's like how to clock if someone is like queer and I'm
[00:35:51.140] 我对那部分很有共鸣。我觉得穿孔也是时尚界一个很重要的元素。是的，我感觉在TikTok上看到很多搞笑内容，比如如何判断一个人是不是同性恋，而我……
[00:36:06.140] Like wait, I do all of those things Unfortunately Like down I think I as well at one point probably was somewhat adjacent to the party girl aesthetic and I think I also had like an aspiring gym rat. Oh Oh
[00:36:06.140] 等等，我好像都做过这些事。不幸的是，我觉得我曾经也有点像派对女孩，而且我好像还曾经是个健身狂。哦哦
[00:36:30.340] I think we didn't touch that. We didn't we didn't touch on the fitness. It's a huge like Pilates. Yes, like long walks Outdoorsy girl That's not me the couch girl, yeah, I'm like totally okay never seen another nature like allergic to nature
[00:36:30.340] 我觉得我们没聊到那个。我们没聊到健身。健身很重要，比如普拉提。对，还有长时间散步。户外女孩。那可不是我，我是个宅女，是啊，我完全没问题，从来没见过像我这样对大自然过敏的人。
[00:36:57.060] Well, it's fun to see in a very very controlled manner like a manicured park But like the great outdoors is the wild I'm Truly domestic. Oh My god, isn't there also like the rat girl? Have you guys do you guys remember that one? I feel like I've heard
[00:36:57.060] 嗯，在精心控制的环境下，比如像修剪整齐的公园里那样，看动物确实挺有意思的。但真正的户外才是野性，而我其实很宅。我的天，是不是还有个叫“老鼠女孩”的故事？你们还记得吗？我感觉好像听过。
[00:37:17.220] But I feel like the records like just like very chaotic energy I think it was like potato at home. I guess it's just like you're not really trying to leave the house So you're just like ratty I guess Okay
[00:37:17.220] 但我感觉这些唱片就像一种非常混乱的能量，我觉得就像土豆在家一样。我猜就是你根本不想出门，所以你就像老鼠一样，我想是吧。好吧。
[00:37:32.860] So rat girl summer is a tick-tock trend that advises young women to act like a city rat in the summer as in lurk around snack on treats and live unabashedly That's crazy, dude
[00:37:32.860] 所以，“鼠女夏日”是一种时下流行的趋势，它建议年轻女性在夏天像城市老鼠一样生活，比如四处游荡、吃零食、肆无忌惮地生活。这太疯狂了，老兄。
[00:37:45.860] You have to scurry outside because you cannot scurry in bed and you have to nibble on any food you like Nibble only I'm Probably like I'm trying to think of the appropriate kind of like you were saying like indoorsy, you know, like potato couch girl, I guess Oh
[00:37:45.860] 你得赶紧跑到外面去，因为在床上跑不动，而且你还得随便吃点东西。只能吃一点点。我可能就像在努力想合适的吃法，就像你说的，像宅在家里的那种，你知道，像个宅女，我想是吧。哦
[00:38:13.580] Homebody kind of a homebody girl. Although now I think a little less so but during kovat dude prime homebody time Thriving I'm still stuck on that chill girl Can we define chill girl of it works? That's such a vague
[00:38:13.580] 宅女，算是那种宅女吧。虽然现在我觉得没那么宅了，但在我宅男时期，我可是宅女中的宅女，而且过得很充实。我还是觉得她很宅。我们能不能给“宅女”下个定义？这个定义太模糊了。
[00:38:32.500] Okay, actually I did get a few tick tock sent to me and the archetype was rather than chill girl It was nonchalant girl. Oh Yeah I think I saw the same kind of like a deep. Yeah. Yeah a little bit most things you're like, oh, you know
[00:38:32.500] 好吧，其实我收到了一些滴答声，里面的典型形象与其说是冷静的女孩，不如说是漫不经心的女孩。哦，是的，我觉得我看到了类似的，有点深沉。是的。是的，大多数情况下你会想，哦，你知道的
[00:38:51.420] That's totally fine. And then maybe you draw the line somewhere So the joke in those tick tocks was like, oh you don't like cats like sorry. This isn't gonna work Yeah, I can see that. I feel like you're very nonchalant. I can't imagine crystal like yelling at someone
[00:38:51.420] 完全没问题。然后也许你会划清界限。所以那些滴答声里的玩笑就像是，哦，你不喜欢猫，抱歉。这行不通。是的，我明白。我觉得你很淡定。我无法想象克丽丝塔尔会冲着别人大吼大叫。
[00:39:05.740] Yeah, I mostly would just be like oh Shit that might be me. I Had like a random thought just now but You guys remember the spice girls? Mm-hmm. How there was like sporty spice and like posh spice and stuff like is that
[00:39:05.740] 对，我通常都会想“糟了，那可能是我”。我刚才突然想到，你们还记得辣妹组合吗？嗯哼。她们有运动辣妹、高贵辣妹之类的，是吗？
[00:39:27.540] The og characterization of woman like is that the original four quadrants that we were allowed to? What were the four quadrants do you remember you said posh spicy spicy There's the sexy one the tomboy one, okay, so there was scary spice scary sporty spice Yeah, scary
[00:39:27.540] 最初对女性的刻板印象，是不是就是我们最初被允许使用的那四个象限？你还记得你说的是哪四个象限吗？高贵辣妹，性感辣妹，假小子辣妹，好吧，还有可怕的辣妹，可怕的运动辣妹，对，可怕的辣妹。
[00:39:53.020] baby spice posh spice and ginger spice There's no ice I Spice is her own like modern Artists. Yeah, she's she's like she's a rapper. I think She's not like affiliated with the spice family She made her own spice That's that's crazy What that's like What?
[00:39:53.020] 宝贝辣妹、高级辣妹和姜味辣妹，没有冰块，我辣妹就像现代艺术家一样，独树一帜。是的，她就像个说唱歌手。我觉得她和辣妹家族没什么关系，她创造了自己的辣妹风格。这太疯狂了！这是什么感觉？什么？
[00:40:38.110] Smells like they need to sue her Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Like is she like try to cover it? It's like if I if I had a stage name that was like Melissa Timberlake or something Trying to capitalize on something that's obviously much more popular
[00:40:38.110] 感觉他们应该起诉她。是啊，这说不通。她是不是想掩盖什么？这就好比我有个艺名，叫梅丽莎·汀布莱克之类的，想利用一个明显更受欢迎的名字来赚钱。
[00:40:54.430] That's surprising but that makes more sense No, this is really interesting I'm also now reading which spice girl are you might have been the ultimate Cosmo quiz and preteen sleepover debate of the late 90s
[00:40:54.430] 这很令人惊讶，但这样解释更合理。不，这真的很有意思。我现在也在读《你是哪位辣妹？》，这可能是90年代末期《Cosmo》杂志最热门的测试题，也是青少年睡衣派对上最热门的辩论话题。
[00:41:07.990] Like basically you're trying to figure out like which archetype you fit in most closely with Wait, so one of them you said is ginger spice. Is that just like you're a ginger and that's a whole category
[00:41:07.990] 基本上，你是想弄清楚自己最符合哪种原型？等等，你刚才提到其中一个是姜味香料。那是不是就是指你是红头发，而姜味香料本身就是一个单独的类别？
[00:41:21.470] I think she was just a ginger. I don't know what her like personality That's her whole assigned ginger effort Do also scary spice Ginger spice was formerly sexy spice. Oh You're like fiery sexually liberated and outspoken actually that makes a lot of sense
[00:41:21.470] 我觉得她只是个红发辣妹。我不知道她性格怎么样，这就是她作为红发辣妹的全部努力。还有，辣妹组合里的“恐怖辣妹”以前是“性感辣妹”。哦，你说的“热情似火、性解放、直言不讳”其实很有道理。
[00:41:47.670] I was like, they couldn't have just named her ginger cuz she's a ginger I think scary spices. These 90s teenage girls at these sleepovers would have loved Okay, so which spice are we can you name them again? Yeah scary spice ginger slash sexy spice sporty spice
[00:41:47.670] 我当时就想，他们不可能就因为她是红头发就给她取名叫姜吧，我觉得应该是“恐怖香料”。90年代的少女们在睡衣派对上肯定会喜欢这个名字。“好吧，所以我们是哪种香料？你能再说一遍吗？”“对，恐怖香料、姜/性感香料、运动香料。”
[00:42:09.870] Baby spice and posh spice. I think baby spice would probably be like what what's that powerpuff girl? Oh my god all the time. Yeah, like kind of I Fucking love bubble And then maybe scary spice is kind of like the girl boss aesthetic. Oh, yes
[00:42:09.870] 宝贝辣妹和高贵辣妹。我觉得宝贝辣妹大概会像“那是什么？飞天小女警？我的天哪！”那样，一直这样。对，就像“我他妈太爱泡泡糖了”那种感觉。然后，恐怖辣妹可能有点像那种女强人的感觉。哦，是的。
[00:42:30.110] Very similar. It's a scary source is wild and crazy Like you're kind of like party girl Oh, but I think I think ginger spice or sexy spice is supposed to be like boss girl and like fierce I see. Yes the one who worked hardest to promote their feminist
[00:42:30.110] 非常相似。这真是个可怕的来源，狂野又疯狂，就像你有点像个派对女孩。哦，但我认为，辣妹组合里的姜汁辣妹或性感辣妹应该是那种女强人，而且很厉害。我明白了。是的，她是最努力宣传女权主义的那个人。
[00:42:47.030] Mmm, so Sorry, this is making me think of powerpuff girls now So bubbles is baby spice and buttercup is scary spice and is blossom was the other one like regular Regular ice ice
[00:42:47.030] 嗯，不好意思，这让我想起了飞天小女警。泡泡是辣妹，毛毛是辣妹，花花是另一个，就像普通的冰块一样。
[00:43:05.270] Dude blossom has orange hair. Maybe she's ginger spice but blossom was like sweet and nice leadership, right? So who's that in the green one? Green is buttercup. She's scary spice. Do I feel like buttercup would be sporty spice? Oh
[00:43:05.270] 哇，Blossom是橙色头发。她可能是Ginger Spice，但Blossom以前是那种甜美又和蔼的领导者，对吧？那穿绿色衣服的是谁？绿色的是Buttercup。她是Scary Spice。我觉得Buttercup会是Sporty Spice吗？哦
[00:43:22.590] Mmm, like more tomboy vibe. Yeah, actually maybe yeah. Oh my god talking about cartoons like Jason watch Teen Titans Yes, I feel like Raven in teen things was like my my icon like she was my eight girl Oh my god first
[00:43:22.590] 嗯，感觉更像假小子那种气质。对，可能吧。我的天啊，说到动画片，比如杰森看《少年泰坦》？是的，我觉得《少年泰坦》里的瑞雯就像我的偶像，她就像我的第八个女孩。我的天啊，首先
[00:43:37.990] I feel like I laid eyes on her when I was like at a young impressionable age and I was like I want to be her like she is me and I'm her I can totally see that Right. Yeah, I'm like Raven's not core, but she is very cool
[00:43:37.990] 我觉得我小时候，大概是懵懂无知的时候，第一次见到她，就觉得我想成为她，她就像我，我就像她，我完全能理解这种感觉。没错，瑞雯虽然不是核心角色，但她真的很酷。
[00:43:50.690] well, I would say I'm a blend of buttercup and Maybe bubbles minus the crying so that makes me That makes me sporty and baby spice, right? Oh, I can see it I feel like I would be a mix of like do I don't know
[00:43:50.690] 嗯，我觉得我像是毛茛花和泡泡糖的混合体，只是少了爱哭，所以这让我感觉既像运动辣妹又像辣妹宝贝，对吧？哦，我明白了，我觉得我像是……嗯，我不知道。
[00:44:09.090] I'm so like the scary spice thing is really appealing to me. I should just go for that Own it. I Feel like scary spice is more appealing to me before I knew the description like if there's if she was just like scary just terrifying
[00:44:09.090] 我真的觉得“恐怖辣妹”这个概念特别吸引我。我应该就选她，大胆尝试。我觉得在知道她的描述之前，她更吸引我，就像如果她真的那么可怕、那么吓人的话。
[00:44:31.250] She's like the ring or the grudge Well Now that we have kind of established our own archetypes via Spice Girls Kind of going back to what we talked about earlier in regards to a lot of these like trends and archetypes
[00:44:31.250] 她就像戒指或怨恨。既然我们已经通过辣妹组合建立了自己的原型，那就回到我们之前讨论的关于这些潮流和原型的内容吧。
[00:44:51.530] Being started by or affecting people who are under 25 a little more than people who are you know around our age And or older do you ever feel like it's weird to I guess observe that and see how like all these
[00:44:51.530] 是由25岁以下的人发起或影响的人比我们这个年龄段或更年长的人更容易受到影响，你有没有觉得观察这种现象很奇怪，看看所有这些事情是如何发生的？
[00:45:07.250] New trends or like cool things are so much more like youth focus where it's like Oh, yeah, like maybe I would have loved that if I were you know a few years younger. I think it's definitely
[00:45:07.250] 新潮流或者酷炫的东西更像是年轻人的关注点，他们会说：“哦，是啊，如果我年轻几岁，我可能也会喜欢这个。” 我觉得这绝对是这样。
[00:45:19.090] Interesting to see it in action. I feel like it's one thing for me to see the abstract like oh, yeah Instagram but like I recently went to a concert and I think the artist playing the concert is probably like in college
[00:45:19.090] 亲眼看到它实际应用很有意思。我觉得对我来说，在Instagram上看到抽象的概念是一回事，但像我最近去听的那场音乐会，我觉得演出的艺术家可能还在上大学。
[00:45:32.970] Like they look really young and then the crowd was really young And then I was like seeing the archetypes kind of in real life, and I was like, whoa Like there's a lot of coquette stuff and like a lot of like bows that kind of girly academia
[00:45:32.970] 她们看起来真的很年轻，观众也很年轻。然后我就感觉看到了现实生活中的典型形象，我当时就想，哇！好多卖弄风情的东西，还有好多蝴蝶结之类的，那种少女学院风。
[00:45:47.210] Look, it was a little bit jarring to see it actually actualized in a way and then I feel like it almost deterred me a little bit from like actually trying to
[00:45:47.210] 你看，亲眼看到它以某种方式变成现实，确实有点让人震惊，然后我觉得它几乎让我有点打消了尝试的念头。
[00:45:59.470] Join an aesthetic know that I typically do that that much but then I was like, oh like I feel like I'm a little aged out of it. And then it made me feel really old Yeah, I
[00:45:59.470] 加入某种美学风格，我知道我通常都会这么做，但后来我突然觉得，哦，我好像有点跟不上时代了。然后我就觉得自己真的老了。是啊，我
[00:46:12.490] Guess it is kind of sobering saying that I remember one time you and I Mel we went to a concert in New York and Everyone was super young. Yeah, we kept seeing X's on people's hands Because they were under 21 and they couldn't get drinks and we were like
[00:46:12.490] 说起来有点让人清醒，我记得有一次你和我，梅尔，一起去纽约看演唱会，那里的人都特别年轻。是啊，我们老是看到有人手上画着叉，因为他们未满21岁，不能喝酒，我们当时就想……
[00:46:31.350] It does make me think like if I was back in college What I'd be following you this aesthetic or what? I have followed a different one Like I feel like there's definitely like each college probably has its own
[00:46:31.350] 这让我想到，如果我还在大学，我会不会也关注你的这种审美风格呢？我关注的是另一种风格。我觉得每个大学肯定都有自己的风格。
[00:46:42.990] Trends and like stuff that people wear so I don't know if East Coast colleges have the same as like California colleges It was really interesting. I was like, I feel like good What is it like sociologists like observing? like a new population I
[00:46:42.990] 潮流和人们的穿着打扮，所以我不知道东海岸的大学和加州的大学是不是一样。这真的很有意思。我当时想，感觉真好。社会学家观察的是什么感觉？就像观察一个新的群体一样。
[00:47:00.990] Definitely feel like I've aged out of a lot of these trends like I feel like things that have been very popular amongst like y2k Like Leroy's or like micro mini skirts. I Have nothing against it and I actually think it's really cute on like that generation
[00:47:00.990] 感觉自己已经过了追赶很多潮流的年纪了，比如Y2K时期很流行的Leroy's牛仔裤或者超短裙。我并不反对这些，而且我觉得它们穿在那个年代的人身上还挺好看的。
[00:47:14.550] I just think that there's part of me that like no longer cares to like be trendy in that way I'm like, I know that that's not something that is really in line with my personal style, but I like it So I'll like consume content about it
[00:47:14.550] 我觉得我内心深处已经不再那么在意追逐潮流了。我知道那其实不太符合我的个人风格，但我还是喜欢看，所以我会浏览相关的内容。
[00:47:26.870] But I do think that some other trends like for example, like bows in your hair or like that kind of look I feel like was really popular kind of went viral all over social media and I feel like
[00:47:26.870] 但我确实认为其他一些潮流，比如头发上的蝴蝶结之类的造型，我觉得非常流行，在社交媒体上迅速传播开来，我觉得
[00:47:38.990] It started with like the younger age groups like the kind of Gen Z folks But then I think it it infiltrated its way into like older influencers and because I saw older influencers like kind of adopting that trend I was like more open to
[00:47:38.990] 一开始是在像Z世代这样的年轻群体中流行起来的，但后来我觉得它渗透到了年纪稍长的影响者群体中，因为我看到一些年纪较大的影响者也开始接受这种趋势，所以我也就更容易接受了。
[00:47:52.110] Like trying it out and stuff So I think it really depends on what like the cool thing or like the it thing is But I do think that in order for me to like try it out
[00:47:52.110] 就像尝试一下之类的。所以我觉得这真的取决于什么东西很酷或者很火。但我确实觉得，对我来说，为了尝试一下……
[00:48:01.990] It feels a little bit more comfortable when I see like people our age or maybe even older like doing something similar The power of influencers, I totally agree If the influencer is like slightly closer to your age or like your life situation or like you just feel more
[00:48:01.990] 看到和我们年龄相仿甚至年纪更大的人做类似的事情，我会感觉更自在。我完全同意，影响力确实很重要。如果网红的年龄、生活境遇或者其他方面和你比较接近，或者你只是感觉更亲切一些，那就更好了。
[00:48:17.550] Relatable or they feel more relatable to you. Then it's just like yeah, like I'll definitely do what they do I feel like the age thing to me Manifests in the form of like what I yearn to be and like what I'm seeking out now Maybe in college
[00:48:17.550] 感觉和他们有共鸣，或者说他们让你觉得和他们更有共鸣。然后你就会想，是的，我肯定会做他们做的事。我觉得年龄对我来说，会体现在我渴望成为什么样的人，以及我现在正在追求什么。也许在大学里会这样。
[00:48:31.830] I would be like oh like this kind of outfit or like this kind of look is so cute Like I should go out and buy it versus now I'm like, oh my god This person wakes up at 5 a.m
[00:48:31.830] 我以前会觉得，哇，这种衣服或者这种造型好可爱，我应该去买一件。但现在我会想，我的天哪，这个人早上五点就起床了！
[00:48:41.270] Every day and like works out before work like that's goals or like oh this person Makes bread from scratch at home Like I would love to do you know Like I feel like it's now more about like actions for me or like things that they do
[00:48:41.270] 每天，比如上班前锻炼，这都是我的目标；或者像这个人，在家自己做面包，我也想学。我觉得现在对我来说，更重要的是他们的行动，或者他们做了什么。
[00:48:53.310] Versus like the look or the aesthetic so then in that sense. I I think I want to emulate different things now Mmm, it's a very good point. I didn't even think about yeah like now that you mentioned it. I'm like, oh, yeah
[00:48:53.310] 比如说外观或美学，从这个意义上讲。我现在想模仿不同的东西。嗯，你说得很有道理。我之前都没想过，你这么一说，我才想起来。哦，对啊。
[00:49:07.230] I think I'm kind of similar to that too. Yeah, like lifestyle choices or just right things outside of just like Apparel or like other visual trends dude. Does this mean that as we got older we? Care more deeply about what's not just on the surface
[00:49:07.230] 我觉得我也有点类似。是啊，比如生活方式的选择，或者说除了服装或其他视觉潮流之外的其他事情。这是否意味着随着年龄的增长，我们会更加注重那些不只是表面的东西？
[00:49:28.150] Crazy question or thought I Think it it does like shift a little bit Although I will say I haven't let go of like the aesthetic thing But I think it's now more like home decor some shit, you know what I mean?
[00:49:28.150] 一个有点疯狂的问题或想法：我觉得它确实发生了一些变化。虽然我并没有放弃审美方面的东西，但我认为它现在更像是家居装饰之类的东西，你明白我的意思吗？
[00:49:42.230] I'm like, how do I decorate my home like this influence? Wait, but that's such a like bigger trap, you know Like at least if you're trying to chase trends you can go to fast fashion as like terrible as that may be but like furniture like
[00:49:42.230] 我当时就在想，我该怎么把家装饰成这种风格呢？等等，但这其实是个更大的陷阱，你知道吗？至少如果你想追逐潮流，你可以选择快时尚，虽然这可能很糟糕，但像家具之类的……
[00:49:55.310] You buy a couch and you're like, okay That was like a thousand dollars and like actually the chop the couch trends have changed You're like why did I just pay rent on a couch that is no longer in
[00:49:55.310] 你买了个沙发，心想，好吧，这可是花了上千美元啊。但实际上，沙发的流行趋势已经变了，你会想，我干嘛白白付钱买个已经过时的沙发呢？
[00:50:10.270] Yeah, I guess like so much harder the activation energy is But I guess that's why I like like as we get older like we can participate in stuff like this well, I think it was very fun to explore our thoughts on our own archetypes on
[00:50:10.270] 是的，我觉得激活能确实很难提升。但我想这就是为什么我喜欢随着年龄增长，我们可以参与这类活动的原因。我觉得探索我们自身原型的想法非常有趣。
