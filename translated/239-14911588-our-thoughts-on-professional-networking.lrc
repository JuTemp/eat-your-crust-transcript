[00:00:00.000] Hi and welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Harpreet.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Harpreet。
[00:00:16.590] Welcome Harpreet to the podcast. Before we get to our topic at hand, we have a fun slang word to
[00:00:16.590] 欢迎 Harpreet 来到播客节目。在我们正式开始今天的主题之前，先来了解一个有趣的俚语……
[00:00:22.990] talk about. The word is pookie and it's also sometimes used as pookie bear. I think this
[00:00:22.990] 谈谈。这个词是pookie，有时也写作pookie bear。我觉得这个
[00:00:30.270] word is really funny because it sounds like what it is, a pet name for someone you care about or love.
[00:00:30.270] 这个词真的很有趣，因为它听起来就像它的意思一样，是对你关心或爱的人的昵称。
[00:00:37.550] And it's pretty funny because the way it's used as slang is kind of ironically or poking fun at
[00:00:37.550] 这挺搞笑的，因为它作为俚语的用法有点讽刺意味，或者说是在嘲笑什么。
[00:00:45.550] the usage of these kinds of sometimes silly pet names. I've actually first seen it from the NBA
[00:00:45.550] 使用这类有时略显滑稽的昵称。我最早是在NBA上看到这种现象的。
[00:00:53.550] or a lot of fans like to call their favorite players pookie especially in moments where they're
[00:00:53.550] 或者很多球迷喜欢称呼他们最喜欢的球员为“pookie”，尤其是在他们……的时候
[00:00:58.750] praising them or admiring them. So I have like a personal theory on why this has
[00:00:58.750] 赞扬他们或欣赏他们。所以我个人对此有一个理论，解释为什么会这样。
[00:01:05.550] researched lately because the word pookie in that term specifically is not new, but there's some
[00:01:05.550] 最近做了一些研究，因为这个词组里的“pookie”并不是新词，但有一些
[00:01:11.310] sort of couple on TikTok that blew up and they live this like very lavish lifestyle. They're very
[00:01:11.310] 一对在TikTok上爆红的情侣，过着非常奢华的生活。他们非常
[00:01:17.710] very affectionate to each other and it's to the point where their skits and TikToks almost
[00:01:17.710] 他们彼此非常亲密，以至于他们的短剧和TikTok视频几乎
[00:01:23.230] feel scripted. So that couple, I think the guy's name is like jet or something and the girl's
[00:01:23.230] 感觉像是事先写好的剧本。那对情侣，我记得男的好像叫杰特什么的，女的……
[00:01:28.270] name is pookie. The couple, they narrate their video. So the guy's like, oh today pookie and I went to
[00:01:28.270] 名字叫Pookie。这对情侣在视频里配音。男的说：“哦，今天我和Pookie去了……”
[00:01:33.630] go do this like blah blah blah. So then I feel like it became a meme of this is like a very publicly
[00:01:33.630] 去做这件事，比如……等等等等。然后我觉得它就变成了一个梗，就像一个非常公开的……
[00:01:39.950] affectionate couple who love posting their affectionate pet names for each other. So let's kind
[00:01:39.950] 一对恩爱的情侣喜欢在社交媒体上分享彼此的爱称。所以，让我们也来友善一点吧！
[00:01:45.710] of take the pookie meme and roll with it essentially. Wow, I had no idea that that couple existed.
[00:01:45.710] 基本上就是把“pookie”这个梗拿来用。哇，我之前都不知道有这对情侣。
[00:01:52.030] I didn't know that people are using it in the media just for terms of
[00:01:52.030] 我不知道人们在媒体上使用它仅仅是出于某种目的。
[00:01:55.390] endearment for random people I guess, but I might start using that just for my friends.
[00:01:55.390] 我猜这是对陌生人的昵称，但我可能会开始只对我的朋友使用这个词。
[00:02:00.830] So I mentioned that I see this a lot in sports so one funny example I can think of is in my fantasy
[00:02:00.830] 我之前提到过我在体育运动中经常看到这种情况，我能想到的一个有趣的例子就是我的梦幻橄榄球。
[00:02:07.310] league with a couple of my high school friends. One of the people, one of the teams they have
[00:02:07.310] 我和几个高中朋友一起参加了一个联赛。其中一人，他们所在的其中一支球队……
[00:02:12.990] LeBron and they named their fantasy team my glorious pookie player.
[00:02:12.990] 勒布朗和他的梦幻球队将我的光荣小精灵球员命名为“我光荣的小精灵球员”。
[00:02:19.150] He's got a game.
[00:02:19.150] 他有本事。
[00:02:20.990] Dude, LeBron is like the perfect I guess victim of this pookie meme because there was this one dinner
[00:02:20.990] 老兄，勒布朗简直就是这个“pookie”梗的完美受害者，因为有一次晚餐……
[00:02:27.950] where James and I were talking with Eddie our friend. I had mentioned something about like oh
[00:02:27.950] 当时我和詹姆斯正跟我们的朋友埃迪聊天。我提到了一些关于……之类的事情。
[00:02:33.070] LeBron is so funny I'm in my LeBron era. I love his whatever blah blah. Afterwards Eddie
[00:02:33.070] 勒布朗太逗了，我现在正沉浸在勒布朗时代。我喜欢他那些随口说说的废话。之后是埃迪。
[00:02:38.670] texted me a compilation video of LeBron highlights and then he was like pookie
[00:02:38.670] 他给我发了个勒布朗精彩集锦视频，然后他就说“噗噗”。
[00:02:43.950] and I just laughed so hard when I saw it. It's like you're fucking right this is pookie.
[00:02:43.950] 我看到的时候真的笑疯了。你说的太对了，这简直就是个小可爱。
[00:02:50.590] I think it's also funny because it's mostly men using this to call other men pookie which for
[00:02:50.590] 我觉得这也很搞笑，因为用这个词的大多是男人，用来称呼其他男人为“pookie”，这真是……
[00:02:57.710] some reason just kind of adds to the hilarity and kind of the charm of it all.
[00:02:57.710] 某种原因反而增添了整件事的滑稽性和魅力。
[00:03:02.590] This is a great term of endearment. I'm gonna call Jace you that as soon as he gets back.
[00:03:02.590] 这是个很棒的昵称。等杰斯回来，我就这么叫你。
[00:03:06.430] Dude, I could totally see you calling Jason that and I feel like the gender stuff
[00:03:06.430] 老兄，我完全能想象你这么叫杰森，而且我觉得这跟性别有关。
[00:03:10.990] actually does kind of make sense because maybe a bunch of episodes ago we talked about how
[00:03:10.990] 其实这有点道理，因为可能在之前的几集里我们讨论过……
[00:03:16.030] people call male celebrities. He's in his baby girl era or he's so baby girl coded but I felt
[00:03:16.030] 人们称男明星为“宝贝女孩”或“宝贝女孩”，但我感觉
[00:03:21.950] like that was always a woman saying that about a man but I feel like pookie is very much so like a
[00:03:21.950] 以前总是女人这样评价男人，但我感觉 Pookie 也非常像……
[00:03:27.710] man calling a man that and that's where the humor comes from so men any men listening out there
[00:03:27.710] 男人这么称呼男人，这就是幽默的来源，所以，男人们，所有在听的男人们，都在这里。
[00:03:34.590] go call your friends pookie.
[00:03:34.590] 去叫你的朋友们“小可爱”吧。
[00:03:36.110] You know I haven't heard of the baby girl era either honestly.
[00:03:36.110] 说实话，我也没听说过女婴时代。
[00:03:40.030] When I talk about women I guess I have been saying like boss lady and whatnot but I also
[00:03:40.030] 当我谈到女性时，我可能一直在说像女强人之类的，但我也
[00:03:45.390] know that I tend to be like a few months behind trends so it doesn't surprise me.
[00:03:45.390] 我知道我通常对潮流的把握会慢几个月，所以这并不让我感到惊讶。
[00:03:51.710] This is also interesting to me because I feel like I've been seeing some sort of wave of men
[00:03:51.710] 这一点也让我很感兴趣，因为我感觉自己好像看到了一股男性浪潮。
[00:03:58.190] being more expressive and accepting of being pampered so you know baby girl era kind of plays
[00:03:58.190] 更善于表达，也更乐于接受宠爱，你知道，就像是“宝贝女孩时代”那种玩法。
[00:04:03.550] into this where men are like you know what actually it is really nice to be pampered.
[00:04:03.550] 在这种情况下，男人们会想，你知道吗，其实被宠爱的感觉真的很好。
[00:04:08.670] Like I do want to be passenger princess once in a while that kind of stuff and I think pookie kind
[00:04:08.670] 比如，我偶尔也想当个公主乘客之类的，我觉得小精灵那种感觉挺好的。
[00:04:14.270] of plays a role in this wave too where it's an opportunity for men to really admire each other
[00:04:14.270] 它也在这股浪潮中扮演着一定的角色，为男人们提供了一个真正互相欣赏的机会。
[00:04:21.950] or kind of share that love for each other in a funny way that's not too serious and I think
[00:04:21.950] 或者用一种轻松幽默的方式表达对彼此的爱，我觉得
[00:04:28.430] everyone just enjoys it and can laugh about it. They're like I love my bro so much but how do I
[00:04:28.430] 大家都觉得挺有意思，都能拿这件事开玩笑。他们会说：“我太爱我兄弟了，但我该怎么做才能……”
[00:04:34.910] make it funny? True. Oh man I wonder if that's why I've had the urge to get my eyebrows threaded
[00:04:34.910] 让它变得有趣？没错。哦，天哪，我怀疑这就是我一直想修眉的原因。
[00:04:42.430] recently and I don't know why. You might be in your baby girl era. Yeah I must be in my baby girl
[00:04:42.430] 最近，我也不知道为什么。你可能正处于你的宝贝女儿时期。是啊，我肯定正处于我的宝贝女儿时期。
[00:04:49.630] Hey man everyone has a right to be in their baby girl era. All in all though I think pookie
[00:04:49.630] 嘿，伙计，每个人都有权利享受自己的宝贝女儿时期。总而言之，我觉得 pookie
[00:04:54.830] is such a funny slang word that is super popular right now and I feel like it's a very good vibes
[00:04:54.830] 这是一个非常有趣的俚语，现在超级流行，我觉得它给人一种非常好的感觉。
[00:05:01.070] kind of everyone's gonna laugh about it and I personally find it really entertaining when I'm
[00:05:01.070] 大家都会觉得好笑，我个人觉得这真的很有趣。
[00:05:07.390] scrolling through you know TikTok or comments or whatever. Yeah definitely. Pookiebear aside today we
[00:05:07.390] 你知道，就是刷刷TikTok或者评论什么的。没错，肯定有。今天先不说Pookiebear，我们
[00:05:14.350] do have a pretty interesting topic. We wanted to talk a little bit about networking and really
[00:05:14.350] 我们确实有一个非常有趣的话题。我们想稍微聊聊人脉关系，而且真的
[00:05:20.510] building rapport and building out connections with people sometimes in a professional way or
[00:05:20.510] 有时以专业的方式与他人建立融洽关系和拓展联系，或者
[00:05:25.550] sometimes just in a casual and social manner but I feel like networking is one of those
[00:05:25.550] 有时候只是以一种随意和社交的方式，但我感觉人脉拓展就是其中之一。
[00:05:30.830] buzzwords that low-key I used to hear about a lot more back in college because I feel like
[00:05:30.830] 那些我以前在大学时经常听到的流行语，因为我觉得……
[00:05:36.670] post college when you're actually working people aren't constantly talking about like oh we need
[00:05:36.670] 大学毕业后真正工作时，人们不会总是谈论“我们需要什么”之类的事情。
[00:05:41.150] a network or maybe that's just the industry I'm in. That's true I don't really network in my
[00:05:41.150] 或许是人脉关系的问题，也可能只是我所在的行业就是这样。确实，我在这个行业里不太注重人脉拓展。
[00:05:46.750] job either to be honest but yeah maybe that's industry related or you know the nature of my job
[00:05:46.750] 说实话，工作方面可能有点问题，但也许跟行业有关，或者你知道我的工作性质。
[00:05:55.390] but I do remember networking was kind of big because of job fairs and stuff from college
[00:05:55.390] 但我记得大学时期人脉关系很重要，因为那时候经常有招聘会之类的活动。
[00:06:01.390] but to be honest I didn't really attend those either. In all honesty I feel like it was very
[00:06:01.390] 但说实话，我也没怎么参加那些活动。老实说，我觉得那非常
[00:06:08.910] weird I remember I attended one at the end of you know end of our senior year and I was like
[00:06:08.910] 真奇怪，我记得我高三那年结束的时候参加过一次，当时我就想：
[00:06:13.630] I just have like a folder of my resume that basically had nothing on it and I'm just like
[00:06:13.630] 我只有一个文件夹，里面装着我的简历，但基本上什么都没有，我就……
[00:06:18.350] going around to people and handing it out and trying to sell them on this weird me like that
[00:06:18.350] 到处找人发东西，试图把这种怪异的东西推销给他们。
[00:06:25.550] doesn't even know what job they have that I'm applying to yeah I definitely feel like I would
[00:06:25.550] 他甚至不知道我申请的是哪个职位，是的，我肯定觉得我会
[00:06:30.510] not want to go to another job fair after that experience. Yeah I think I went to maybe one
[00:06:30.510] 那次经历之后，我不想再去参加招聘会了。嗯，我想我可能只去过一次。
[00:06:36.590] job fair at most in college and I'm not sure if it was that helpful for me honestly I mean
[00:06:36.590] 大学期间我最多参加过几次招聘会，说实话，我不确定它对我有多大帮助。
[00:06:42.510] maybe I just was bad at networking but I think the end result with most of these companies that I
[00:06:42.510] 也许我只是不擅长人际交往，但我认为最终与这些公司达成的协议大多都有效。
[00:06:49.310] chatted with was just oh you can go back and go to our webpage and find a job and apply there
[00:06:49.310] 聊天对象只是说，哦，你可以回去访问我们的网页，在那里找工作并申请。
[00:06:55.150] so ultimately it didn't really feel super helpful but I do think some of my friends who are more
[00:06:55.150] 所以最终感觉帮助不大，但我确实觉得我的一些朋友更……
[00:07:01.630] in STEM or like CS had a better experience because I know sometimes they did literally
[00:07:01.630] 在STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）或计算机科学等领域，我的经历更好，因为我知道有时候他们确实会……
[00:07:08.510] interviews on site at those job fairs but in my experience in my limited job fair experience
[00:07:08.510] 那些招聘会上会有现场面试，但就我有限的招聘会经验而言，
[00:07:15.310] it wasn't super helpful personally. Yeah and I feel like the really awkward thing about job fairs is
[00:07:15.310] 对我个人而言，这并没有太大帮助。是啊，我觉得招聘会最尴尬的地方在于……
[00:07:23.150] for me as someone who has social anxiety meeting someone one-on-one and like trying to have a
[00:07:23.150] 对我这个有社交焦虑的人来说，一对一地与人见面并尝试进行……
[00:07:29.070] meaningful conversation with them is already kind of hard enough but you're doing that with
[00:07:29.070] 和他们进行有意义的对话已经够难了，而你还要和他们进行这样的对话。
[00:07:33.790] line of 50 people behind you who are waiting to have the same exact conversation with like slightly
[00:07:33.790] 你身后排着50个人，他们都在等着和你进行一模一样的对话，感觉有点……
[00:07:39.470] different nuances and details with the interviewer so then I feel like it's just super awkward where
[00:07:39.470] 面试官对细节和细节的描述各不相同，这让我感觉非常尴尬。
[00:07:44.190] you're like I feel like these people can hear me so you're extra self-conscious and you also hear
[00:07:44.190] 你会觉得好像这些人能听到我说话，所以格外在意自己的言行，而且你也能听到
[00:07:49.070] the interviewer or the representative of the company giving the same 10 second spiel you've
[00:07:49.070] 面试官或公司代表用同样的10秒钟时间向你介绍自己。
[00:07:53.630] heard 40 times in line already. I just remember being really anxious and after going to one I
[00:07:53.630] 排队的时候已经听过40遍了。我只记得当时真的很焦虑，去了一家之后……
[00:07:58.990] was like okay yeah I don't think I could ever go to one ever again. I don't know about you
[00:07:58.990] 我当时就想，好吧，我想我以后再也不会去那种地方了。我不知道你怎么想。
[00:08:02.910] all but I feel like these networking events feel kind of not genuine sometimes it feels like
[00:08:02.910] 但我总觉得这些社交活动有时不太真诚，感觉就像……
[00:08:11.230] you know you're trying to say the right thing or you know something that'll make you stand out to
[00:08:11.230] 你知道你想说些正确的话，或者你知道些能让你脱颖而出的话。
[00:08:17.150] people and it just feels kind of like you have a front up and it's not quite you out there.
[00:08:17.150] 人们会觉得你好像戴着面具，但在外人面前展现的并不是真正的你。
[00:08:23.470] True and I feel like just something about the term networking makes me think there has to be
[00:08:23.470] 没错，而且我觉得“人脉”这个词本身就让我觉得必须要有……
[00:08:29.070] an exchange sort of of like some sort of service or like favor. I feel like if it wasn't associated
[00:08:29.070] 某种交换，有点像某种服务或人情。我觉得如果它不关联的话。
[00:08:35.550] with the term networking and you met someone who would just be like oh it was like cool meeting
[00:08:35.550] 说到人脉拓展，你遇到的人可能会说，哦，很高兴认识你。
[00:08:38.590] this person but when the word networking gets involved it feels a little bit transactional maybe
[00:08:38.590] 这个人，但一提到“人脉”这个词，就感觉有点像是在做交易。
[00:08:43.710] and a little bit too professional and cold so I remember feeling pretty intimidated by the word
[00:08:43.710] 而且语气有点过于专业和冷漠，所以我记得当时我对这个词感到相当畏惧。
[00:08:48.110] itself. Yeah it definitely feels like there's like added pressure there to somehow form a bond
[00:08:48.110] 确实，感觉好像有一种额外的压力，必须想办法建立某种联系。
[00:08:53.870] like you mentioned they're giving their elevator pitch and you somehow have to also throw your
[00:08:53.870] 就像你说的，他们在做电梯演讲，而你却还得想办法插话。
[00:08:57.950] elevator pitch out there and like Crystal said to going back to like the college reference from
[00:08:57.950] 就像Crystal说的那样，回到大学的例子，就像电梯演讲一样。
[00:09:02.590] a few moments ago trying to stand out compared to the 80 other kids that probably have the same exact
[00:09:02.590] 几分钟前，我还在努力让自己从其他80个可能拥有完全相同装备的孩子中脱颖而出。
[00:09:07.870] resume as you. Yeah I totally agree with what you said Jisoo that's a really good way of putting
[00:09:07.870] 以你现在的身份继续工作。是的，我完全同意你说的，Jisoo，这确实是一个很好的表达方式。
[00:09:13.710] it. It just feels very transactional like this is stuff that I do and how does that relate to
[00:09:13.710] 感觉很像交易，就像这是我做的事情，而这些事情与什么有关
[00:09:19.150] you and I feel like you can definitely tell when people are more interested in you because
[00:09:19.150] 你我都觉得，你肯定能感觉到别人是否对你更感兴趣，因为
[00:09:24.590] of maybe your connections or your position at work I don't know they're like foaming at the
[00:09:24.590] 也许是你的人脉关系，或者是你在工作中的地位，我不知道，他们都像疯了一样。
[00:09:31.310] mouth to like get your time. It's slimy. I do think that certain industries probably rely a little bit
[00:09:31.310] 用嘴巴占时间。这很恶心。我确实认为某些行业可能有点依赖……
[00:09:38.430] more heavily on networking like I can totally see how someone who's maybe in sales or finance
[00:09:38.430] 更注重人脉关系，我完全可以理解，像销售或金融行业的人会这么想。
[00:09:45.390] or something like that like something that requires a lot more social interaction maybe
[00:09:45.390] 或者类似需要更多社交互动的事情。
[00:09:48.590] networking is a lot more helpful. I do remember actually going back to those dreaded job fairs
[00:09:48.590] 人脉关系真的很有用。我还记得自己曾经重新参加过那些令人头疼的招聘会。
[00:09:54.590] seeing people with really good elevator pitches and honestly just like a pretty personable warmth
[00:09:54.590] 看到那些电梯演讲能力很强，而且待人真诚热情的人。
[00:10:00.670] to them when they were talking to the interviewer and being very impressed. Like I can't believe
[00:10:00.670] 当他们和面试官交谈时，他们表现得非常出色，我简直不敢相信。
[00:10:04.910] both of us are 21-22 but I'm here like stuttering through my 10 second intro
[00:10:04.910] 我们俩都21、22岁，但我现在却结结巴巴地做着10秒钟的自我介绍。
[00:10:10.910] and they're here dapping up the interviewer basically. That's a good point. I agree there's
[00:10:10.910] 他们基本上是在跟采访者击掌。说得对。我同意，确实如此。
[00:10:16.670] definitely positions out there like you said that benefit a lot from networking. Luckily for
[00:10:16.670] 正如你所说，确实有一些职位非常依赖人脉关系。幸运的是……
[00:10:22.590] me I'm not in one of those positions. How about you all do you think networking plays a role in your
[00:10:22.590] 我本人并不属于这种情况。你们觉得呢？你们认为人脉关系在你们的职业生涯中扮演什么角色？
[00:10:30.190] job or industry? Sadly I'm in biotech and so biotech on its own and then specifically like
[00:10:30.190] 工作还是行业？很遗憾，我身处生物科技行业，所以就说生物科技本身，然后具体来说，比如……
[00:10:38.110] a lot of the biotech companies are in South San Francisco. If you work here you're probably
[00:10:38.110] 许多生物技术公司都位于南旧金山。如果你在这里工作，你很可能
[00:10:42.670] going to work at another company like literally down the street or on the same exit
[00:10:42.670] 去另一家公司上班，比如就在街对面或者同一个出口。
[00:10:46.590] and people are always just hopping around so it's sort of hard to not try to at least have like that
[00:10:46.590] 人们总是到处奔波，所以很难不去尝试至少拥有那样的体验。
[00:10:53.710] baseline networking done. So all the fun small talk and leaving a good rapport with people.
[00:10:53.710] 基础人脉拓展完成。接下来就是轻松愉快的闲聊，以及与他人建立良好关系。
[00:10:58.750] Yeah I mean specifically for biotech it feels like you need to do it a little bit because
[00:10:58.750] 是的，我的意思是，尤其是在生物技术领域，感觉你需要做一点，因为
[00:11:02.510] everyone somehow ends up knowing everybody or there's somebody from your company that's
[00:11:02.510] 最终每个人都会互相认识，或者你公司里会有人认识其他人。
[00:11:06.990] going to be at the next one you're going to apply to and it just always it always helps out.
[00:11:06.990] 在你下次申请的时候，它肯定会有帮助。
[00:11:10.990] Yeah I think I'm probably in a similar boat to Heartpreet. I think my job specifically isn't
[00:11:10.990] 是的，我觉得我的情况可能和Heartpreet差不多。我觉得我的工作具体来说并不是这样。
[00:11:16.430] super networking focused but the industry that I'm in is very small especially in the Bay Area
[00:11:16.430] 我非常注重人脉拓展，但我所在的行业规模很小，尤其是在湾区。
[00:11:22.830] so then everyone knows each other through like one or two bridges max and it's very very common for
[00:11:22.830] 所以，大家最多只通过一两座桥认识彼此，这种情况非常普遍。
[00:11:29.230] new people joining our company to already know like a handful of people who are at our company.
[00:11:29.230] 新加入我们公司的人，可能已经认识我们公司里少数几个人了。
[00:11:34.590] I feel like it's not an explicit need like it is in some industries but it's definitely
[00:11:34.590] 我觉得这不像某些行业那样是一种明确的需求，但它确实是一种需求。
[00:11:39.150] something where it's almost more of like the oh don't burn any bridges kind of networking rather
[00:11:39.150] 这更像是一种“别断了后路”式的社交方式。
[00:11:44.190] than oh this person will be useful later on in my career kind of networking. True can't be burning
[00:11:44.190] 而不是那种“哦，这个人以后对我的职业生涯会有用”式的社交。确实不能烧毁
[00:11:49.710] too many bridges out there. For now until you guys are boss ladies then it's over.
[00:11:49.710] 前面的桥太多了。现在，除非你们都成为女强人，否则一切都结束了。
[00:11:56.350] So I do want to kind of touch back on I guess what I would consider success stories for
[00:11:56.350] 所以我想稍微再谈谈我认为的成功案例。
[00:12:02.030] networking. I feel like networking to some extent is a skill that you kind of learn and build
[00:12:02.030] 建立人脉。我觉得人脉在某种程度上是一种可以学习和培养的技能。
[00:12:08.350] upon. I mean my personal approach to networking I feel like I'm still fine-tuning but I have seen
[00:12:08.350] 关于我个人的人脉拓展方式，我觉得我还在不断完善，但我已经看到
[00:12:13.710] people do it really well so do you guys have any examples of witnessing someone maybe build a
[00:12:13.710] 人们在这方面做得非常出色，所以你们有没有亲眼见过有人建造过类似的东西的例子？
[00:12:18.030] connection with someone and being very impressed by how naturally or easily they were able to do it?
[00:12:18.030] 与某人建立联系，并对其自然或轻松地做到这一点印象深刻？
[00:12:23.870] I will say just to bring up Jsu again touching back on this exactly what I thought of Jsu when
[00:12:23.870] 我只想再次提及JSU，这让我想起了我对JSU的看法。
[00:12:29.870] you mentioned you're seeing somebody like tap up the interviewer. When I hear Jsu interact with
[00:12:29.870] 你提到你看到有人在和面试官搭讪。当我听到Jsu与……互动时。
[00:12:35.470] his colleagues it's like super impressive. It sounds like a super casual conversation like it just
[00:12:35.470] 他的同事们真是太厉害了。听起来像是一次非常随意的对话，就像……
[00:12:40.670] sounds like he's talking to one of us. I guess it depends on what you define as like a successful
[00:12:40.670] 听起来他好像在跟我们中的某个人说话。我想这取决于你如何定义“成功人士”。
[00:12:45.790] networking like dogma but I think everyone has their own way. I personally think I always have
[00:12:45.790] 人脉关系就像教条一样，但我认为每个人都有自己的方式。就我个人而言，我认为我一直都有
[00:12:52.510] to start with small talk and then find a small nugget that they'll give me and then just try
[00:12:52.510] 先闲聊几句，然后找个他们愿意透露的小信息，接着就试试看。
[00:12:58.110] to really hammer it till I can divulge the conversation a little more and open it up
[00:12:58.110] 我要反复强调，直到我能更详细地透露一些信息，并敞开心扉地谈论这件事。
[00:13:03.150] and then try to connect on like a personal level if there's anything to even connect on.
[00:13:03.150] 然后尝试在个人层面上建立联系，如果真的有什么共同点的话。
[00:13:07.390] There are I feel like a lot of times where you just don't vibe with the person it just doesn't work out.
[00:13:07.390] 我觉得很多时候，你和对方就是合不来，所以就没能走到一起。
[00:13:14.670] I think definitely when I said the Dapping Up story I was also kind of envisioning Jsu so that
[00:13:14.670] 我觉得当我讲到“Dapping Up”的故事时，我脑海里肯定也浮现出了Jsu的画面。
[00:13:19.870] is hilarious but actually I thought Heartbreak you would be such a good guest for this episode
[00:13:19.870] 太搞笑了，不过说实话，我觉得《伤心你》这首歌很适合来这期节目做嘉宾。
[00:13:24.750] too because I consider you someone who is very good at networking definitely someone who's really
[00:13:24.750] 而且因为我认为你非常擅长人际交往，绝对是一个真正优秀的人。
[00:13:29.950] personable and kind of easy to get to know. I feel like that's sometimes the hard part right
[00:13:29.950] 性格随和，很容易相处。我觉得有时候这反而是最难的部分，对吧？
[00:13:35.150] it's like especially in a professional setting for example how do you mix being professional while
[00:13:35.150] 尤其是在专业场合，例如，如何将专业性与……结合起来
[00:13:40.190] also being yourself and I think getting a good balance between those two is really where like
[00:13:40.190] 做你自己也很重要，我认为在这两者之间找到一个好的平衡点才是关键所在。
[00:13:45.950] the difficulty and the nuance lies. This actually makes me reflect on what networking means
[00:13:45.950] 难点和微妙之处就在于此。这让我不禁反思人脉关系的真正含义。
[00:13:52.750] beyond just these events that we've kind of been talking about like job fairs or
[00:13:52.750] 除了我们一直在讨论的这些活动，比如招聘会之外，还有其他一些活动。
[00:13:57.790] you know networking specific events. I'm starting to realize that the connections we have in our office
[00:13:57.790] 你知道，就是那种专门的社交活动。我开始意识到，我们在办公室里建立的人脉关系非常重要。
[00:14:05.230] are also a part of networking you know building that relationship with your co-workers or your
[00:14:05.230] 这也是人脉拓展的一部分，你知道，就是与你的同事或同事建立关系。
[00:14:11.630] stakeholders and people that you work with closely this I guess would be your more immediate
[00:14:11.630] 利益相关者和与你密切合作的人，我想这应该是你最直接的考虑因素。
[00:14:17.630] network and so building and maintaining those connections is just as important maybe even
[00:14:17.630] 因此，建立和维护人脉关系至关重要，甚至可能比……
[00:14:23.550] more important in a lot of ways in this world of networking because you know making sure that these
[00:14:23.550] 在当今这个网络世界里，这一点在很多方面都更加重要，因为你知道，确保这些
[00:14:28.990] relationships are healthy positive and functional ensures that working every day is a lot easier
[00:14:28.990] 健康、积极、良好的人际关系能确保每天的工作更加轻松。
[00:14:37.710] than if these connections were not as developed. Yeah I feel like there's definitely a lot of merit
[00:14:37.710] 如果这些联系没有发展得这么完善，情况就会大打折扣。是的，我觉得这绝对很有道理。
[00:14:43.870] to doing that especially because these are the people you see the most often and oftentimes
[00:14:43.870] 这样做尤其重要，因为这些人是你最常见到的人，而且这种情况经常发生。
[00:14:49.470] people you have like a deeper connection with rather than a fleeting like moment of networking
[00:14:49.470] 你更倾向于与人建立更深层次的联系，而不是像人际交往那样短暂的邂逅。
[00:14:56.510] can be bigger helps or it can become longer and like closer connections later on in life too.
[00:14:56.510] 它可以带来更大的帮助，也可以在以后的生活中发展成更长久、更紧密的联系。
[00:15:01.550] Yeah and honestly thinking about it now and reflecting I think I'm similar to you Jisoo
[00:15:01.550] 是的，说实话，现在想想，我觉得我和你很像，智秀。
[00:15:06.910] how you mentioned earlier that you kind of have a fear of the word networking I totally
[00:15:06.910] 你之前提到过你有点害怕“人脉拓展”这个词，我完全理解。
[00:15:11.710] agree because I think I always viewed it as something really uptight proper and like official
[00:15:11.710] 同意，因为我一直觉得它很正式，很拘谨，很官方。
[00:15:19.470] but now that you know we're talking it through and I made the realization earlier that you know
[00:15:19.470] 但现在你知道了，我们正在讨论这件事，而且我之前也意识到了这一点，你知道
[00:15:24.910] connecting with your co-workers is in a sense networking too it makes me feel a lot more
[00:15:24.910] 与同事建立联系在某种意义上也是一种人脉拓展，这让我感觉好多了。
[00:15:30.110] comfortable with this word and I kind of like this shifting slash reframing of the word networking
[00:15:30.110] 我对这个词感到很自在，而且我挺喜欢这种对“人脉”一词的重新定义和诠释。
[00:15:38.110] it makes it feel much more approachable and reasonable I guess. I have two things to
[00:15:38.110] 这让我感觉更容易接受，也更合理。我有两点想说。
[00:15:45.630] say about that I guess first one relating it back to attaching pressure to the term networking
[00:15:45.630] 关于这一点，我想首先要说的是，它与给“人脉”这个词施加压力有关。
[00:15:51.870] when you guys first asked me about the topic I was definitely a little nervous because like I
[00:15:51.870] 你们第一次问我这个话题的时候，我确实有点紧张，因为……
[00:15:55.390] don't know if like I think I'm decent at it and I want to say thank you for saying that you
[00:15:55.390] 我不知道自己做得怎么样，我觉得我做得还不错，我想说谢谢你这么说。
[00:16:00.750] think I'm good at it because I'm not good at taking confidence so I'm going to take it as
[00:16:00.750] 我认为我擅长这个，因为我不擅长建立自信，所以我打算把它当作……
[00:16:06.030] I'm in my baby girl era when you guys also mentioned like networking slash like building
[00:16:06.030] 我正处于我的宝贝女儿时代，你们也提到了人脉拓展之类的话题。
[00:16:11.630] rapport keeping connections with people that part definitely eased my mind and I was like oh yeah it
[00:16:11.630] 和人保持融洽的关系，这一点确实让我安心了不少，我当时就想，哦，对啊。
[00:16:16.190] doesn't necessarily have to be in the professional setting but on the flip side I feel like when I
[00:16:16.190] 不一定非得是在专业场合，但另一方面，我觉得当我
[00:16:21.790] do sort of do that similar approach reaching back out to old managers or people in the industry
[00:16:21.790] 可以采取类似的方法，重新联系以前的经理或业内人士。
[00:16:27.310] that you've kept up with I feel like when I have done that certain mentors I've had I feel like
[00:16:27.310] 我觉得我一直坚持这样做，当我这样做的时候，我遇到的某些导师让我觉得
[00:16:32.830] when I email them they're just like what's up what do you need so I feel like they sort of know
[00:16:32.830] 我给他们发邮件的时候，他们总是回复“怎么了，有什么事吗？”，感觉他们好像知道我的情况。
[00:16:38.350] it's like I'm at like a point in my life where I'm about to look for a new job or a lost
[00:16:38.350] 感觉我现在正处于人生的一个转折点，即将面临找新工作或者失业的困境。
[00:16:43.630] maybe I need to work on that I mean that's good though your mentors are so ready and happy
[00:16:43.630] 也许我需要在这方面努力，我的意思是，这很好，你的导师们都非常乐于助人，而且乐于助人。
[00:16:50.750] to help you out right away they're like hey what do you what do you need I'm here that's great this
[00:16:50.750] 为了立刻帮助你，他们会问：“嘿，你需要什么？我在这里，太好了！”
[00:16:55.870] is also just how my mom picks up the phone on the daily when I call her she's like what's wrong
[00:16:55.870] 我妈每天接电话也是这样，我打电话给她，她总是问：“出什么事了？”
[00:17:00.830] like mom I'm like your literal daughter I just want to chat my mom will also be that
[00:17:00.830] 就像妈妈一样，我简直就是你的女儿，我只是想和你聊天，我妈妈也会那样。
[00:17:06.590] and it leaves me so much anxiety I'm like is there something wrong yeah oh my god wait actually
[00:17:06.590] 这让我非常焦虑，我总觉得是不是出什么问题了？哦，我的天哪，等等，真的吗？
[00:17:15.630] I think I pick up the phone from my mom I pick up like oh what's wrong is there anything you need
[00:17:15.630] 我想我接起我妈的电话，我接起来问：“哦，怎么了？你需要什么吗？”
[00:17:24.750] everyone's just always concerned do you guys text your parents more or call them more
[00:17:24.750] 大家总是很关心，你们是多给父母发短信还是多打电话。
[00:17:29.630] I personally text my mom more but my mom just responds with a k just literally k
[00:17:29.630] 我个人给我妈发短信比较多，但我妈回复的就一个“k”，就一个“k”。
[00:17:35.390] my mom actually also like sending voice memos to me which honestly they're not bad but I feel like
[00:17:35.390] 我妈妈其实也喜欢给我发语音留言，说实话，语音留言还不错，但我感觉……
[00:17:43.070] I'm listening to it and I'm like why am I listening to a voicemail right now you're like this is
[00:17:43.070] 我正在听，然后我就想，我为什么现在在听语音留言？你就像在说，这是
[00:17:47.150] worse than a text and worse than a call yeah I think me or my mom texts a lot but phone calls I
[00:17:47.150] 比发短信还糟糕，也比打电话还糟糕，是啊，我觉得我和我妈经常发短信，但打电话……
[00:17:55.950] feel like are more upkeep maybe like once every two weeks or so I'm just generally terrible at
[00:17:55.950] 感觉保养更频繁一些，比如每两周一次左右，我在这方面实在是不擅长。
[00:18:02.670] texting as you guys probably know now working on it always working on it but yeah I think my mom
[00:18:02.670] 你们可能也知道，我一直在努力发短信，一直在努力，但是，嗯，我觉得我妈妈
[00:18:09.150] probably texts me more than I text her but I'll usually just if she texts me I'll just call her
[00:18:09.150] 她可能比我更常给我发短信，但我通常只有在她给我发短信时才会打电话给她。
[00:18:12.990] like what do you want oh my god it's kind of the opposite for you to like usually parents
[00:18:12.990] 你想要什么？我的天哪，这跟你通常的想法正好相反，就像父母一样。
[00:18:20.670] respond to a text by calling but you respond to your mom's text by calling yeah I'm a self-proclaimed
[00:18:20.670] 你回复短信用打电话，但你回复你妈妈的短信却用打电话，是的，我自称是……
[00:18:28.030] well on the topic of texting versus calling how do you reach out to old co-workers or old
[00:18:28.030] 关于发短信还是打电话这个话题，你如何联系以前的同事或老朋友呢？
[00:18:34.830] connections do you call them text them email them usually email and then I always say like
[00:18:34.830] 联系方式，你打电话、发短信、发邮件吗？通常是邮件。然后我总是说，就像
[00:18:42.030] I'd love to set up a call or being person coffee whatever I can't say I've really reached out
[00:18:42.030] 我很想安排一次通话，或者约个时间喝杯咖啡什么的，但我不能说我真的主动联系过你。
[00:18:47.630] to like old co-workers or anything like that but the times that I have interacted with old
[00:18:47.630] 不喜欢老同事之类的，但我与老同事互动的次数并不多。
[00:18:52.510] co-workers it's always been text I feel like email might feel a little bit too working professional
[00:18:52.510] 和同事们一直都是发短信，我觉得发邮件可能显得有点太职业化了。
[00:18:58.190] girly vibes that's true I think I can agree email definitely feels like super proper I think the
[00:18:58.190] 确实很有少女心，我觉得可以同意。电子邮件给人的感觉确实非常正式。
[00:19:05.790] way that I've hit up old co-workers sometimes we bump into each other in the hall at work so we
[00:19:05.790] 我有时会用这种方式联系以前的同事，比如在工作场所的走廊里偶遇，所以我们
[00:19:11.150] kind of have like drive by highs you know to each other but from there that kind of sparks
[00:19:11.150] 就像是短暂的邂逅，彼此之间有过那种兴奋感，但之后就擦出了火花。
[00:19:16.750] the conversation like oh I'll find some time on your calendar and we just send a calendar
[00:19:16.750] 对话内容大概是这样的：“哦，我会帮你安排时间。”然后我们发个日历过去。
[00:19:21.470] invite no email maybe like a work DM so that's usually what I do for old co-workers who are
[00:19:21.470] 不发邮件邀请，也许可以发工作私信，我通常对以前的同事都是这么做的。
[00:19:28.590] still at the company maybe for people who aren't at the same company anymore I would maybe maybe
[00:19:28.590] 还在公司的人或许可以，但对于那些已经不在同一家公司的人来说，我或许可以。
[00:19:36.270] send an email like a lighthearted email or if I have their number I could try texting so what
[00:19:36.270] 发封轻松的邮件，或者如果我有他们的号码，我可以试试发短信，怎么样？
[00:19:41.950] I find really interesting that I've experienced at this company is like you know how people
[00:19:41.950] 我觉得我在这家公司经历的非常有趣的事情是，你知道，人们是如何相处的
[00:19:47.390] do goodbye emails to the company when they leave I always found it interesting that a lot of my
[00:19:47.390] 我觉得很有意思的是，很多人在离职时都会给公司发告别邮件。
[00:19:53.790] ex-corkers will be like oh like hoping and keep in touch here's my email either linkedin or phone
[00:19:53.790] 以前的那些人会说，哦，就像希望一样，保持联系，这是我的邮箱、LinkedIn 或电话。
[00:19:59.390] number and then here's my instagram oh i'm like dude instagram is wild oh my god like yeah wow at
[00:19:59.390] 号码，然后是我的Instagram，哦，我当时就想，老兄，Instagram太疯狂了，我的天哪，哇哦！
[00:20:05.630] first I was with you like you know linkedin phone number that's all normal but then you said
[00:20:05.630] 一开始我跟你在一起，你知道的，就像LinkedIn上的电话号码那样，这都很正常，但后来你说……
[00:20:10.350] instagram I was like wait what dude so I do have a lot of ex-corkers like we keep up over IGDMs
[00:20:10.350] 我在Instagram上看到这个，当时我就想，等等，老兄，什么？我的确有很多以前的歌迷，我们通过IGDM保持联系。
[00:20:17.790] oh interesting what is the general age of your co-workers if you don't mind me asking
[00:20:17.790] 哦，很有意思。请问您的同事们的平均年龄是多少？
[00:20:23.630] I mean that's a fair question like a lot of my co-workers tend to be plus or minus 10 to 15 years
[00:20:23.630] 我的意思是，这确实是个合理的问题，因为我的很多同事的年龄都差不多在10到15年之间。
[00:20:28.350] or so and then women so then you know our generation we love our instagram whatever so
[00:20:28.350] 或者说，然后是女性，你知道我们这一代人喜欢Instagram之类的东西，所以
[00:20:34.350] it does feel a little bit less like invasion of privacy and more like oh here's my casual
[00:20:34.350] 感觉这与其说是侵犯隐私，不如说是“哦，这是我的休闲装”。
[00:20:38.670] instagram but it's just so funny thinking about IGDMs also being networking oh my god imagine
[00:20:38.670] Instagram，但一想到IGDM（私信）也能起到社交作用，就觉得好笑，我的天哪，想想都觉得不可思议。
[00:20:44.590] genz is like hey here's my snapchat no god what do your co-workers post on instagram I think a lot of
[00:20:44.590] Z世代就像在说：“嘿，这是我的Snapchat账号。”天哪，你的同事们在Instagram上都发些什么呢？我觉得很多……
[00:20:54.910] it is just like oh here's my family here's my hobby I like to cook like kind of standard stuff
[00:20:54.910] 就像，哦，这是我的家人，这是我的爱好，我喜欢做饭，就是那种很普通的东西。
[00:21:01.070] but sometimes people post like kind of political stuff on their instagram story too and I always
[00:21:01.070] 但有时候人们也会在Instagram故事里发布一些政治方面的内容，我总是
[00:21:07.070] find that interesting it's never anything outlandish or nothing that makes me feel weird
[00:21:07.070] 我觉得这很有意思，它从来不会让人觉得怪异或古怪。
[00:21:11.790] considering the demographics of where we live I feel like people lean a certain way
[00:21:11.790] 考虑到我们居住地的人口结构，我觉得人们倾向于某种特定的观点。
[00:21:15.710] there's like a certain standard that you are used to but yeah I just could never imagine sending
[00:21:15.710] 好像你已经习惯了某种标准，但说实话，我根本无法想象要寄送这些东西。
[00:21:21.630] like a to all like to literally every single person in the company here's my instagram you know
[00:21:21.630] 就像给公司里的每一个人一样，这是我的Instagram账号，你们知道吗？
[00:21:26.430] what I mean I mean imagine the CEO sees this yeah but maybe that is a way to keep that feeling
[00:21:26.430] 我的意思是，想象一下CEO看到这个会是什么反应，但也许这正是保持这种感觉的一种方式。
[00:21:34.190] a little bit less formal and more casual because like we talked about email sometimes
[00:21:34.190] 稍微轻松随意一些，就像我们之前讨论电子邮件时那样。
[00:21:40.030] does feel very professional but through instagram I feel like once you see someone's family or something
[00:21:40.030] 确实感觉很专业，但通过 Instagram，我觉得一旦你看到某人的家人或其他什么，就会觉得有点不对劲。
[00:21:45.870] you just feel like you know them so much more or like so much deeper even if you haven't really
[00:21:45.870] 即使你实际上并没有真正了解他们，你也会感觉自己对他们更加了解，或者说感情更加深刻。
[00:21:50.350] talked about it directly or have never met their family like you still kind of get a better
[00:21:50.350] 即使直接谈论过，或者从未见过他们的家人，你仍然能更好地了解他们。
[00:21:54.510] sense of what this person's life is like and I feel like it's definitely a sign of like true
[00:21:54.510] 我能感受到这个人的生活状态，我觉得这绝对是真爱的标志。
[00:22:02.430] connection there was this one time at work where there was an event and I was you know
[00:22:02.430] 有一次在工作中，发生了一件事，你知道的，我当时就在现场。
[00:22:07.630] really starting to bond with one of my co-workers we kept DMing each other through work chat and then
[00:22:07.630] 我和一位同事的关系越来越好，我们一直通过工作聊天软件互发私信，然后
[00:22:13.630] at one point she was just like oh here like this is actually my phone number you know I don't always
[00:22:13.630] 有一次她突然说：“哦，这是我的电话号码，你知道，我并不总是这样。”
[00:22:18.670] respond right away to my work DMs just message me here I'll respond a lot faster and I was like
[00:22:18.670] 请立即回复我的工作私信，或者直接在这里给我留言，我会更快回复。我当时就想：
[00:22:24.590] oh my god like I'm so honored to have your phone number you know I it was a very exciting moment
[00:22:24.590] 我的天哪，能有你的电话号码我真是太荣幸了，你知道吗，那真是个激动人心的时刻。
[00:22:31.070] and I really felt much more connected do you draw a fine line though with the people you'd want to
[00:22:31.070] 我真的感觉彼此之间的联系更紧密了。但是，你是否会和你想与之相处的人划清界限呢？
[00:22:37.230] text because I definitely feel like there are certain co-workers where even if they give me
[00:22:37.230] 发短信是因为我觉得确实有些同事，即使他们给我发信息，我也不会真的想和他们交流。
[00:22:44.110] their number there's no shot I want to like break that personal barrier of like hey it's okay to text
[00:22:44.110] 他们的号码？没办法，我只想打破那种私人隔阂，告诉他们“嘿，发短信没关系”。
[00:22:49.390] me at any time of the day yeah that's definitely true luckily though I have a work phone number
[00:22:49.390] 一天中的任何时间我都可能遇到这种情况，没错，确实如此。不过幸运的是，我有一个工作电话号码。
[00:22:57.470] that most people at work have access to and you know that is specifically for work and I guess it's a
[00:22:57.470] 大多数上班族都能访问，而且你知道那是专门用于工作的，我想这是一种
[00:23:03.870] lot more rare for me to actually share my personal number with co-workers okay that's fair there was
[00:23:03.870] 对我来说，把私人电话号码给同事其实很少见，好吧，这很公平。
[00:23:11.310] a particular instance when I did get a call from my VP because like something was happening at the
[00:23:11.310] 有一次，我的副总裁给我打了个电话，说公司那边出了点事。
[00:23:17.550] company and I was like fully in the shower and I saw it to like call from maybe you know your VP
[00:23:17.550] 公司，当时我正在洗澡，然后我看到一个电话，可能是你们副总裁打来的。
[00:23:24.030] and I was just like I was like oh no am I getting fired I was like what is happening
[00:23:24.030] 我当时就想，哦不，我要被解雇了吗？到底发生了什么？
[00:23:29.950] but yeah it was nothing it was nothing terrible that's good we also don't have that they recently
[00:23:29.950] 但确实没什么，没什么大不了的，那很好。我们最近也没有那种情况。
[00:23:35.390] have been offering us like a work phone if we want it for security purposes but this job in
[00:23:35.390] 公司一直提出，如果我们出于安全考虑需要，可以给我们提供一部工作手机，但这份工作……
[00:23:41.470] my last job it's just been like our actual phones that you see right away under your contact
[00:23:41.470] 我上一份工作就是处理像联系人里你一眼就能看到的那些手机。
[00:23:46.830] information there well one potential worker on this is you can maybe get like a virtual
[00:23:46.830] 关于这方面的信息，一个潜在的工作机会是，你或许可以获得类似虚拟工作的机会。
[00:23:53.390] number through google voice and then treat that as your work phone number and like pass it out to people
[00:23:53.390] 通过 Google Voice 获取一个号码，然后将其作为你的工作电话号码，并把它提供给其他人。
[00:24:01.950] okay I might I might need to do that yeah I think that's actually how our work phone number works
[00:24:01.950] 好的，我可能需要那样做。嗯，我想我们的工作电话号码就是这样运作的。
[00:24:06.990] so even if you don't have like a physical work phone you can just use the like google voice
[00:24:06.990] 所以即使你没有实体工作电话，你也可以使用谷歌语音之类的服务。
[00:24:11.230] virtual number okay I think I might need to do that because the only co-workers I've given
[00:24:11.230] 虚拟号码？好吧，我想我可能需要这么做，因为我唯一给过的同事都是虚拟号码。
[00:24:16.110] my number to that X is the ones that I will you know hang out with outside of work pretty
[00:24:16.110] 我给X的号码就是那些我会在工作之外一起出去玩的人。
[00:24:21.550] right it is kind of interesting talking about giving out personal phone numbers and what not
[00:24:21.550] 对，谈论泄露个人电话号码之类的事情还挺有意思的。
[00:24:26.510] though because I totally agree that is very much like breaking a certain boundary or like barrier
[00:24:26.510] 虽然我完全同意，这很像打破某种界限或障碍。
[00:24:32.430] almost once you start to be comfortable texting this person instead of work slack and etc but
[00:24:32.430] 几乎一旦你开始习惯用短信而不是工作 Slack 等方式与这个人交流，但
[00:24:38.990] the question is like how do you break that boundary you know like I think it's easy enough
[00:24:38.990] 问题在于，你如何打破那道界限？你知道，我觉得这很容易。
[00:24:42.990] when someone else broaches that for you but if you have someone that you want to become
[00:24:42.990] 当别人主动提起这件事时，但如果你自己想成为那样的人，那就另当别论了。
[00:24:48.670] better friends with and not just oh slack during work hours friends with then how would you personally
[00:24:48.670] 如果想和别人成为更好的朋友，而不仅仅是工作时间随便聊聊的朋友，那么你个人会怎么做呢？
[00:24:53.790] go about that honestly I think I just wait for the other person to give me their number
[00:24:53.790] 说实话，我觉得我就是等对方给我电话号码。
[00:25:00.190] yeah same honestly I think it's either happened from the other person saying it or I got thrown
[00:25:00.190] 是啊，说实话，我也觉得要么是对方说了什么，要么是我被误导了。
[00:25:05.950] into like a group text and they already had those people's numbers I think there was one other time
[00:25:05.950] 就像在群聊里一样，他们好像已经有了那些人的号码，我想还有一次也是这样。
[00:25:10.750] where one of those co-workers that I was it was like okay to be friends with they were going
[00:25:10.750] 我当时的一位同事，我觉得和她做朋友还不错，他们要走了。
[00:25:15.470] to New York or visiting somewhere and I was like oh I have like a list of wrecks if you want it so
[00:25:15.470] 去纽约或者去其他地方玩的时候，我就说，哦，我这儿有一份沉船清单，你要是想要的话可以给我。
[00:25:19.630] they're just like oh just feel free to text it to me it's a nice easy way to do that you're like
[00:25:19.630] 他们会说，哦，随便发短信给我就行了，这是个很方便的方法。你就会想，
[00:25:25.310] are we friends now yeah we're all just shy we are although I will say I have you know initiated
[00:25:25.310] 我们现在是朋友了吗？嗯，我们都只是比较害羞而已。不过我得说，我已经主动和你聊过了。
[00:25:33.870] like the number exchange a couple times wow I mean part of it is the paranoia because I feel
[00:25:33.870] 就像交换号码几次那样，哇，我的意思是，一部分原因是出于妄想，因为我感觉
[00:25:39.310] like when you communicate on work platforms like I don't always want to share everything about my
[00:25:39.310] 比如在工作平台上交流的时候，我并不总是想分享关于我的一切。
[00:25:44.750] life on a work platform so then maybe if we're going to go out later or something like that I'm
[00:25:44.750] 在工作平台上生活，所以如果我们之后要出去玩什么的，我
[00:25:49.470] like oh yeah like what's your number and then we'll just casually exchange it I think you just have
[00:25:49.470] 比如，哦，对啊，问问你的电话号码，然后我们就随便交换一下，我觉得你只是……
[00:25:53.630] to have a couple of good conversations and that it's okay to broach that boundary a couple of non-small
[00:25:53.630] 进行几次良好的对话，并且稍微触及一下界限也是可以的，哪怕只是一些无关紧要的小事。
[00:26:00.110] talk exchanges and then you're qualified to exchange phone numbers I wonder too though maybe
[00:26:00.110] 先进行简单的交流，然后你们才有资格交换电话号码，我也在想这个问题。也许吧。
[00:26:06.190] it's a little harder or less common for us personally to initiate this exchanging of
[00:26:06.190] 对我们个人而言，主动发起这种交流有点困难或不太常见。
[00:26:13.710] phone numbers because nowadays we're so connected like you know work chat slack whatever we get the
[00:26:13.710] 电话号码，因为现在我们联系太紧密了，比如工作聊天、Slack等等，我们都能收到。
[00:26:20.430] notifications on our phone and it's pretty close to having someone's number maybe that's like another
[00:26:20.430] 手机上的通知，这跟拥有某人的电话号码非常接近，也许就像另一种方式。
[00:26:27.310] factor that slows us down from sharing our personal number with our co-workers yeah that's a
[00:26:27.310] 阻碍我们与同事分享私人电话号码的因素是……
[00:26:33.630] good point maybe also because we are younger and maybe like earlier in our careers because I remember
[00:26:33.630] 说得有道理，或许也因为我们比较年轻，而且可能还处于职业生涯的早期阶段，因为我记得
[00:26:39.950] seeing my dad's address book you know back then it used to be like a journal almost and you would
[00:26:39.950] 看到我爸爸的通讯录，你知道，那时候它几乎就像一本日记，你会……
[00:26:44.350] like hand write the address book and I remember like all of them were past colleagues or associates
[00:26:44.350] 就像手写通讯录一样，我记得里面的人几乎都是以前的同事或熟人。
[00:26:50.590] because once you move companies or the longer you work more and more people jump to different
[00:26:50.590] 因为一旦你换公司，或者工作时间越长，越来越多的人会跳槽到其他公司。
[00:26:55.230] companies so my dad would just keep all of their phone numbers and like emails for us we're
[00:26:55.230] 所以我爸爸会帮我们保存所有公司的电话号码和电子邮件地址。
[00:27:00.510] probably at the first couple companies you know maybe we're only like five years deep into our
[00:27:00.510] 可能在最初的几家公司里，你知道，我们可能才成立五年左右。
[00:27:06.270] career so less of a need for that yet handwriting something is crazy yeah I think the other day my
[00:27:06.270] 职业生涯让我不太需要那样做，但手写东西真是太疯狂了，是啊，我想前几天我的
[00:27:14.110] co-worker was like do we even use paper anymore and I was like oh shoot I think I do sometimes
[00:27:14.110] 同事问我，我们现在还用纸吗？我说，哦，糟了，我想我有时候还是会用。
[00:27:20.750] I still hand write my notes a bit I prefer that and I definitely like retain things a lot better if
[00:27:20.750] 我仍然会手写一些笔记，我更喜欢这样，而且我确实觉得这样更容易记住东西。
[00:27:26.350] I do that but I don't feel like I have the time to anymore but it was it was really funny
[00:27:26.350] 我以前也这么做，但我现在感觉没时间了，不过那真的很有趣。
[00:27:30.990] I had been taking some notes on some stuff that I saw in lab like put on my desk and one
[00:27:30.990] 我当时正在记一些我在实验室里看到的东西，比如放在桌子上的东西，还有一样东西。
[00:27:34.910] of those co-workers that I'm close to walk by she was just like is that your handwriting
[00:27:34.910] 我跟几个关系比较近的同事擦肩而过时，她就问：“这是你的笔迹吗？”
[00:27:40.590] I was like you're gonna help me like that like I thought I was gonna be a doctor so I was practicing
[00:27:40.590] 我当时想，你会那样帮助我，就像我以前想当医生一样，所以我一直在练习。
[00:27:46.670] to have chicken scratch no it's so true though because I feel like in high school I know how
[00:27:46.670] 用鸡爪子乱抓东西？不，这话说得太对了，因为我觉得在高中我就知道怎么做了。
[00:27:53.310] all of my close friends handwriting looks like but the people that I met post high school like
[00:27:53.310] 我所有好朋友的字迹都长这样，但我高中毕业后认识的人的字迹却长这样
[00:27:58.350] even college friends like I have no idea what their handwriting looks like because we didn't
[00:27:58.350] 即使是我这样的大学朋友也不知道他们的笔迹长什么样，因为我们以前没见过他们。
[00:28:01.390] really hand write shit oh my god that's so true yeah like before we could just recognize our like
[00:28:01.390] 真的手写东西，我的天哪，太对了，就像以前我们能一眼认出自己的字一样。
[00:28:08.030] closest friends handwriting so true well besides our already formed connections like our old co-workers
[00:28:08.030] 除了我们已经建立的联系之外，最亲密的朋友的笔迹也同样真实，比如我们以前的同事。
[00:28:15.630] or current co-workers have you ever successfully followed up with someone after meeting them for
[00:28:15.630] 或者你现在的同事，你是否曾经在见过面后成功地与他们进行后续沟通？
[00:28:23.230] the first time at like a networking event or wherever I did meet someone it wasn't necessarily
[00:28:23.230] 第一次在类似社交活动或其他场合遇到某人时，并不一定
[00:28:29.390] a networking event but it was back in college I went to like a resume workshop and the people who
[00:28:29.390] 虽然是人脉拓展活动，但那是在大学的时候，我参加了一个简历研讨会之类的活动，当时参加的人……
[00:28:36.430] were reviewing your resume for you were working professionals so then this person who worked
[00:28:36.430] 我们正在审核您的简历，因为您是职场人士，所以这位曾经工作过的人
[00:28:42.430] at some sort of bank or something like that reviewed my resume gave me a couple pointers
[00:28:42.430] 在一家银行之类的机构，有人审阅了我的简历，并给了我一些建议。
[00:28:46.590] and was like oh actually like I'm intrigued by some of the stuff that you worked on in your
[00:28:46.590] 然后我就说，哦，其实我对你之前做的一些东西很感兴趣。
[00:28:51.150] classes here's my business card feel free to like shoot me a note if you want some sort of
[00:28:51.150] 这是我的名片，如果你想学习什么，请随时给我留言。
[00:28:56.030] like summer job and yeah so I got the business card I was like whoa what the fuck and then I like
[00:28:56.030] 就像暑期工那样，然后我就拿到了名片，当时我就想，卧槽，这他妈什么玩意儿？然后我就……
[00:29:02.910] thought about it for a little bit and then I was like okay I'm gonna email this person so I emailed him
[00:29:02.910] 我考虑了一会儿，然后心想，好吧，我得给这个人发邮件，于是我就给他发了邮件。
[00:29:07.630] and I was like hey like it was so nice meeting you thanks for the pointers blah blah would love
[00:29:07.630] 我当时就说，嘿，很高兴认识你，谢谢你的建议等等等等，我很乐意。
[00:29:12.350] to know what the opportunities are you know something generic email and then I sent it
[00:29:12.350] 想了解有哪些机会，你知道，就是那种千篇一律的邮件，然后我就发了出去。
[00:29:16.830] and then we had a couple of exchanges like back and forth I think like the logistics of where
[00:29:16.830] 然后我们进行了一些来回的交流，我想大概是关于物流方面的问题吧。
[00:29:21.630] the location of the job and stuff didn't end up working out but I was still like
[00:29:21.630] 工作地点之类的最终没能成行，但我当时还是觉得……
[00:29:26.270] I can't believe these things happen where someone is just like oh this is pretty cool like do you
[00:29:26.270] 我简直不敢相信这种事会发生，有人会说“哦，这挺酷的”，然后问“你觉得呢？”
[00:29:30.030] want a job because I felt like it was such a like I mean I guess not that big of a deal but
[00:29:30.030] 我想要一份工作，因为我觉得这很重要，我的意思是，我想这也不是什么大事，但是
[00:29:34.670] for me it felt like a very big deal and like a movie moment almost no dude that's definitely a
[00:29:34.670] 对我来说，这感觉意义非凡，就像电影里的情节一样，几乎没人会这么想。
[00:29:39.470] big deal that's so cool that was you making it yeah that's the American dream
[00:29:39.470] 那太棒了，太酷了，是你做的，对，这就是美国梦。
[00:29:46.590] yeah yeah do you see just let her her resume dude talking for her we're out there in the corner
[00:29:46.590] 是啊是啊，你看到了吗？让她放简历吧，伙计替她说话，我们都被晾在角落里了。
[00:29:55.390] being shy and she's just she's just getting all the jobs seriously I mean I feel like if I were
[00:29:55.390] 她性格很害羞，但她真的什么工作都得到了。我的意思是，我觉得如果我是她……
[00:30:01.870] in that position I would think about it and I would ponder and like you know kind of go back
[00:30:01.870] 处于那种境地，我会思考，我会琢磨，然后就像你知道的那样，回到原点。
[00:30:08.430] and forth and I'd be like oh fuck it like I'm too shy I know exactly what you're talking about
[00:30:08.430] 反反复复，我就会想，算了，我太害羞了，我完全明白你在说什么。
[00:30:15.550] though because I remember feeling that way too and it's almost backwards because it's like oh this
[00:30:15.550] 虽然我也记得自己有过那种感觉，而且情况几乎正好相反，因为感觉就像……哦，这个
[00:30:20.110] person was the one who thought my resume was kind of interesting so he was like let me know if you
[00:30:20.110] 那个人觉得我的简历挺有意思的，所以他就说，如果你……请联系我。
[00:30:25.550] want me to help you with something right but then I'm the one who felt the pressure of like oh I
[00:30:25.550] 你想让我帮你做点什么，对吧？但结果却是我感到压力，就像……哦，我
[00:30:31.550] now I feel like I can't let this person down or like you know like met this guy for like 20 minutes
[00:30:31.550] 现在我觉得我不能让这个人失望，或者说，你知道，我才认识这个人20分钟而已。
[00:30:36.190] one day and I just felt all this like weird pressure for myself so I think that's the thing
[00:30:36.190] 有一天，我突然感到一股莫名的压力，我想这就是原因吧。
[00:30:41.070] about networking there's just so much pressure for no reason for sure I guess this kind of just goes
[00:30:41.070] 关于人脉拓展，确实有很多毫无理由的压力，我想这种情况就是这样吧。
[00:30:47.230] to show that it's kind of cliche to say but like you know there's no loss in trying like the worst
[00:30:47.230] 虽然这话听起来有点老套，但你知道，尝试一下也没什么损失，哪怕是最差的尝试。
[00:30:53.470] that can happen is this guy says uh actually no sorry we ended up not having positions
[00:30:53.470] 可能会出现的情况是，这个人说，呃，其实不，抱歉，我们最终没有找到合适的职位。
[00:30:59.390] but that is like very minimal loss compared to the potential gain that you could have had
[00:30:59.390] 但这与你本可以获得的潜在收益相比，损失微不足道。
[00:31:06.190] you know he did have opportunities and you got to talk more about it and
[00:31:06.190] 你知道他确实有过机会，你们应该多谈谈这件事。
[00:31:10.430] you almost got a job out of it too so I think I've been kind of noticing that in just like
[00:31:10.430] 你差点也因此找到了一份工作，所以我觉得我一直在注意到这一点，就像……
[00:31:16.830] day-to-day life too not just networking things or work related stuff so I think that's definitely
[00:31:16.830] 也包括日常生活，不只是人脉关系或工作相关的事情，所以我认为这绝对是其中之一。
[00:31:23.390] a good philosophy to keep in mind yeah I fully super resonate with that piece of advice because I
[00:31:23.390] 这是一个很好的理念，值得牢记。是的，我非常认同这条建议，因为我
[00:31:30.910] maybe not in my personal life but in my professional life I hammer that so hard because
[00:31:30.910] 也许在我的个人生活中并非如此，但在我的职业生涯中，我对此深信不疑，因为
[00:31:36.590] most of the time or maybe I've just realized I don't have much to lose if you're just sending
[00:31:36.590] 大多数时候，或许我只是意识到，如果你只是发送信息，我也没什么可失去的。
[00:31:40.830] an email like that or asking a question and so I'm like instilled in my brain that like literally
[00:31:40.830] 像这样的邮件，或者问一个问题，所以我的脑子里就根深蒂固地记住了这一点。
[00:31:46.110] the worst thing that's gonna happen is they're gonna say no and tough shit you know like I can
[00:31:46.110] 最糟糕的情况就是他们拒绝，然后你就只能认栽了，你知道，就像我能做的那样。
[00:31:51.150] move on with my life if that's the answer so it's it's not it's not that big of a deal
[00:31:51.150] 如果这就是答案，那我就继续我的生活吧。所以，这不是什么大事。
[00:31:55.390] yeah definitely easier in a professional setting for me for some reason to sort of have that
[00:31:55.390] 是的，不知为何，在职业环境中，对我来说肯定更容易做到这一点。
[00:31:59.950] mindset rather than a personal setting that's like goals honestly I don't know what it is for me
[00:31:59.950] 与其说是一种个人设定，不如说是一种心态，比如目标之类的，说实话，我不知道对我来说是什么。
[00:32:06.430] but there's been times where people are like oh I applied to this job at your company like can we
[00:32:06.430] 但有时候，人们会说：“哦，我申请了你们公司的这个职位，我们能……”
[00:32:11.710] chat or can you give me a referral you know even people in college reaching out and be like oh can
[00:32:11.710] 聊天或者你能给我推荐人吗？你知道，甚至大学生也会主动联系我，说“哦，可以吗？”
[00:32:16.590] you review my resume blah blah and every time that comes in I'm like oh that's like cool that
[00:32:16.590] 你审阅了我的简历，等等等等，每次收到这样的信息，我都会想，哦，那挺好的。
[00:32:20.350] they would ask me like of course I'm more than happy to do it I'll like give them long paragraphs
[00:32:20.350] 他们会问我，我当然很乐意，我会给他们写很长的段落。
[00:32:24.830] of advice and like spend a lot of time on it whatever but when it comes time for me to maybe ask
[00:32:24.830] 我会给出建议，也会花很多时间在这上面，但到了该我开口问的时候，我可能就会问了。
[00:32:30.830] for the reverse I'm like oh I don't want to like bother this person I don't want to be a burden
[00:32:30.830] 反过来，我就会想，哦，我不想打扰这个人，我不想成为他的负担。
[00:32:36.350] and despite me having received those exact same requests and not feeling like they were a
[00:32:36.350] 尽管我也收到过完全相同的请求，而且感觉它们并不像是……
[00:32:41.390] burden at all I think my brain just reverse engineers it and I'm like I'm a burden on this
[00:32:41.390] 我觉得这根本不是负担。我的大脑好像反向推导出了这个想法，然后我就觉得我成了别人的负担。
[00:32:46.590] person so I think what both of you said is super important to keep in mind it's like
[00:32:46.590] 所以我觉得你们俩说的都非常重要，一定要牢记在心，就像……
[00:32:51.390] fuck it like why not kind of a mentality for sure and honestly I I feel like this is super
[00:32:51.390] 管他呢，为什么不呢？这是一种心态，老实说，我觉得这超级棒。
[00:32:57.790] applicable to work too and I'm still working on this for sure but basically you know asking for help
[00:32:57.790] 这同样适用于工作，我还在努力，但基本上就是寻求帮助。
[00:33:04.910] or asking clarifying questions yeah and I feel like it's totally possible that someone else is
[00:33:04.910] 或者问一些澄清问题，是的，我觉得完全有可能是其他人。
[00:33:10.750] wondering the same thing and you know you ask this clarifying question and now you understand
[00:33:10.750] 你也有同样的疑问，所以你问了这个问题，现在你明白了。
[00:33:15.790] it better you'll be able to do your project better and you know other people who are also
[00:33:15.790] 这样你就能更好地完成项目，而且你还能认识其他也在做同样事情的人。
[00:33:20.510] curious or didn't quite grasp what was happening get a refresher too so I feel like it's definitely
[00:33:20.510] 如果感到好奇或者没完全理解发生了什么，也可以复习一下，所以我觉得这绝对是必要的。
[00:33:27.710] something that's really beneficial in the long run and overall that's what I'm still working on too
[00:33:27.710] 从长远来看，这确实是一件非常有益的事情，而且总的来说，这也是我目前仍在努力的方向。
[00:33:34.910] it's like you know they say there's no stupid questions but there's definitely some
[00:33:34.910] 就像人们常说的“没有愚蠢的问题”，但实际上肯定有一些问题很愚蠢。
[00:33:38.270] some stupid questions out there going back to how Crystal asked about following up with
[00:33:38.270] 有些问题很愚蠢，比如Crystal之前问的关于后续跟进的问题。
[00:33:44.990] connections that you've made I was trying to think about it and the only times I've been in a position
[00:33:44.990] 我一直在思考你建立的人脉关系，而我只有在以下情况下才会处于这种境地
[00:33:51.230] where I have to do that not like GC where she just got offered a job close but I feel like it's through
[00:33:51.230] 我必须这样做，不像GC那样，她只是很快得到了一份工作，但我感觉这事儿还没完。
[00:33:57.150] family friends or friends of friends that I ended meeting where like you guys said they'll offer
[00:33:57.150] 我遇到的家人朋友或朋友的朋友，就像你们说的那样，他们会提供
[00:34:02.350] to like connect with you again and so it's never been through a number directly I think both
[00:34:02.350] 想再次联系你，所以从来没有直接通过电话号码联系过你，我想两者都没有。
[00:34:07.790] times it's happened it's either been straight through LinkedIn and then we eventually we'll
[00:34:07.790] 这种情况发生过几次，要么直接通过LinkedIn，然后我们最终会……
[00:34:11.790] just set up a call damn I totally forgot that interacting with your family friends could also
[00:34:11.790] 刚安排了一次通话，该死，我完全忘了和家人朋友互动也可以
[00:34:17.230] be networking because oftentimes at least in our parents generation I feel like those family
[00:34:17.230] 要建立人脉，因为很多时候，至少在我们父母那一代，我觉得那些家人……
[00:34:22.670] friends are in higher up positions or at least have way more experience working in a certain
[00:34:22.670] 朋友们的职位比我高，或者至少在某个领域拥有更丰富的经验。
[00:34:28.350] industry than you so at the very least they will have tons of advice but also just objectively
[00:34:28.350] 他们比你更了解这个行业，所以至少他们会给你很多建议，而且他们也会客观地告诉你这一点。
[00:34:34.110] they could also be good connections so true actually my brother had a friend who studied what
[00:34:34.110] 它们也可能是很好的人脉，确实如此。我哥哥有个朋友学的是什么专业？
[00:34:41.070] my dad works in which is double E and I remember one time my dad was hiring so he actually asked
[00:34:41.070] 我爸爸在一家叫 Double E 的公司工作，我记得有一次我爸爸招人，所以他就问了这个问题。
[00:34:46.430] my brother he was like hey if you have any classmates or friends who you think are pretty
[00:34:46.430] 我哥哥说，嘿，如果你有同学或朋友，你觉得她们很漂亮的话。
[00:34:50.510] hardworking and smart tell them they should apply for this position that I'm hiring for
[00:34:50.510] 告诉那些勤奋聪明的人，他们应该申请我正在招聘的这个职位。
[00:34:55.630] and so my brother told his friend to apply and you know they went through the interview
[00:34:55.630] 于是我哥哥让他的朋友去申请，然后他们就去面试了。
[00:34:59.870] and everything and my dad ended up really loving his application and interview and you
[00:34:59.870] 一切都很顺利，我爸爸最终非常喜欢他的申请和面试，还有你
[00:35:05.390] know once he got hired my dad was like dude this guy's such a great worker I'm so glad
[00:35:05.390] 我爸在他被录用后就说：“这小子工作太出色了，我真高兴。”
[00:35:09.230] that you told him to apply he's like one of my one of my best employees at the moment so definitely
[00:35:09.230] 你让他去应聘，他现在是我最优秀的员工之一，所以肯定没问题。
[00:35:17.070] some valuable connections from family friends yeah I feel like basically one of those two times I've
[00:35:17.070] 是的，我觉得基本上有那么两次，我都从家人朋友那里获得了一些宝贵的人脉。
[00:35:22.270] been able to connect the family friend or friend through my parents surprisingly just like what G.
[00:35:22.270] 出乎意料的是，我能够通过父母联系到一位家庭朋友或朋友，就像 G 所说的那样。
[00:35:26.750] Susan he just happened to be like I think he was like a C. S. O. at like a biotech company
[00:35:26.750] 苏珊，他碰巧就像……我想他好像是一家生物科技公司的首席战略官。
[00:35:31.710] at first my friends like oh this guy works in bio you should just meet him because they
[00:35:31.710] 一开始我的朋友们会说，哦，这个人是搞生物的，你应该去见见他，因为他们
[00:35:35.630] don't really know what I do and sometimes I don't know what I do but yeah it just happened to be that
[00:35:35.630] 我其实不太清楚自己在做什么，有时候我真的不知道自己在做什么，但事情就是这样发生的。
[00:35:41.630] he actually works for like a pretty a pretty cool company that does similar stuff to what I work on
[00:35:41.630] 他实际上在一家相当不错的公司工作，这家公司做的事情和我做的很相似。
[00:35:46.350] this sort of worked out then he was like a just super personable guy so even though he had like that
[00:35:46.350] 事情后来还算顺利，他是个特别有亲和力的人，所以即使他有那样的毛病……
[00:35:51.870] I guess level of expertise or he was like a higher up it was pretty chill that's awesome
[00:35:51.870] 我猜他专业水平很高，或者他是个高层，总之他很随和，真棒！
[00:35:58.190] do you guys actually have any like do's and don'ts in regards to networking though
[00:35:58.190] 你们在人脉拓展方面真的有什么需要注意的事项吗？
[00:36:04.110] what kind of immediately comes to mind for me is a big don't don't cold email people asking for
[00:36:04.110] 我首先想到的就是千万不要给陌生人发邮件询问什么。
[00:36:13.950] referrals I think it's kind of off-putting if you ask someone who has no clue who you are
[00:36:13.950] 我觉得，如果你问一个完全不知道你是谁的人推荐人，会有点让人反感。
[00:36:20.750] for a referral into their company you know they don't know anything about you your work ethic
[00:36:20.750] 要想获得他们公司的推荐，你知道他们对你和你的职业道德一无所知。
[00:36:26.750] who you are what you're good at past projects any of that kind of stuff so I feel like
[00:36:26.750] 你是谁，你擅长什么，过去的项目等等，诸如此类的事情，所以我感觉
[00:36:33.230] you know definitely don't cold call or email straight into a referral I think it's important to
[00:36:33.230] 你知道，绝对不要直接打电话或发邮件给推荐人，我认为这一点很重要。
[00:36:40.670] kind of build the rapport up first yeah I think a do from my experience would be to
[00:36:40.670] 先建立融洽的关系，是的，根据我的经验，我认为应该这样做。
[00:36:48.190] somewhat leverage your close friends and like people in your immediate network first
[00:36:48.190] 首先要适当利用你的亲密朋友和你身边的人脉关系。
[00:36:53.870] even if you don't directly know someone who maybe works in the company that you want to go to
[00:36:53.870] 即使你不直接认识在你想去的公司工作的人，也可以去试试。
[00:36:58.350] one of your close friends might have a connection and even if it doesn't lead to like a referral at
[00:36:58.350] 你的某个好朋友可能有人脉，即使最终没有直接推荐，也可能给你介绍人。
[00:37:03.310] least having a conversation with someone could always be like super illuminating and helpful
[00:37:03.310] 至少和别人聊聊天总是很有启发性和帮助性的。
[00:37:08.430] I feel like a don't is don't talk to that person and then like only ask stuff that might feel
[00:37:08.430] 我觉得应该避免的就是不要和那个人说话，然后只问一些可能会让人不舒服的问题。
[00:37:15.310] too pointed or like selfish almost like you I think you want to get to know the job
[00:37:15.310] 太尖锐或者太自私，几乎跟你一样，我觉得你想了解这份工作。
[00:37:18.830] in the company but also that person and what they do so not just being like oh can you
[00:37:18.830] 在公司里，也要考虑这个人以及他们的工作内容，而不仅仅是问“哦，你能……”
[00:37:22.990] give me info about ABCDE like TYI you know being a little bit more personable I think is super important
[00:37:22.990] 请给我一些关于ABCDE的信息，比如TYI，你知道，更亲切一些我觉得非常重要。
[00:37:30.430] totally agree with both of your do's and don'ts and yeah I think my do's are just the opposite of
[00:37:30.430] 我完全同意你们提出的建议和禁忌，而且我觉得我的建议恰恰与你们的相反。
[00:37:36.750] what chisel said not to do so like you just said if I don't know anyone like in my direct network
[00:37:36.750] 奇泽尔说不要这么做，就像你刚才说的，如果我在我的直接人脉圈里不认识任何人的话。
[00:37:42.350] that you know works at a particular place I'm looking at or like isn't the same position
[00:37:42.350] 你知道在某个特定地方工作的人，或者我喜欢的人，并不是同一个职位。
[00:37:46.750] that I'm trying to get into going back like two years when I was looking for a job I basically
[00:37:46.750] 我现在想说的是，大概两年前我找工作的时候，我基本上……
[00:37:51.950] find jobs that were just posted at companies that I liked reach out to a senior level at that company
[00:37:51.950] 找到我喜欢的公司刚刚发布的职位，并联系该公司的高层管理人员。
[00:37:59.150] of that position and just sort of like you guys said like hey just just looking at chat
[00:37:59.150] 就那个位置而言，就像你们说的，嘿，就看看聊天记录吧。
[00:38:04.110] I'm like a early professional and I you know I'd love to know what you did to get to your position
[00:38:04.110] 我算是职场新人，我很想知道你是如何走到今天这一步的。
[00:38:09.310] blah blah blah I think I only did it like four or five times but of all those times those people
[00:38:09.310] 巴拉巴拉巴拉，我想我只做过四五次，但所有这些次里，那些人
[00:38:14.350] have like been more than happy to refer me like right after that they'll naturally be like
[00:38:14.350] 他们似乎非常乐意推荐我，之后他们自然而然就会这样。
[00:38:18.670] are you looking for a job it's like uh maybe like are you offering one yeah if you insist
[00:38:18.670] 你在找工作吗？嗯，或许吧，你是在提供工作机会吗？是的，如果你坚持的话。
[00:38:29.790] but yeah I feel like more often than not people are definitely very willing to help out
[00:38:29.790] 但是，我觉得大多数情况下，人们都非常乐意提供帮助。
[00:38:35.470] one of the things that I remember so clearly is I think this was back in 2017 or 2018
[00:38:35.470] 我清楚地记得一件事，我想这应该是2017年或2018年的事。
[00:38:43.550] when subtle asian traits was still really big and people used facebook a decent amount still
[00:38:43.550] 那时候，亚洲人的微妙特征还很流行，人们也经常使用Facebook。
[00:38:49.790] there was this kind of like spin-off of subtle asian traits it was subtle asian dating and
[00:38:49.790] 由此衍生出了一种类似“微妙的亚洲特质”的现象，那就是“微妙的亚洲约会”。
[00:38:55.630] this one girl she took advantage of that and she posted herself and she said hey forget about
[00:38:55.630] 有个女孩利用了这一点，她发了自己的照片，然后说，嘿，忘了这事儿吧。
[00:39:02.030] dating I'm looking for like job referrals um and she kind of like you know described herself
[00:39:02.030] 约会对象，我正在寻找工作推荐，嗯，她有点像，你知道的，描述了一下自己。
[00:39:08.350] and she was like hey if anyone is interested in giving me a job referral then let's connect and
[00:39:08.350] 她当时说，如果有人愿意给我推荐工作，那就联系我吧。
[00:39:14.670] let's chat a bit and you know ultimately it's beneficial for both parties because the girl
[00:39:14.670] 咱们聊一会儿吧，你知道，最终这对双方都有好处，因为女孩
[00:39:20.030] ends up getting a referral to a great tech company and then you know if the referral does
[00:39:20.030] 最终获得一家优秀科技公司的推荐，然后你就知道这个推荐是否有效了。
[00:39:24.910] go through usually there's some sort of incentive on the other side for the person who
[00:39:24.910] 通常情况下，对方会给参与者提供某种激励。
[00:39:28.990] did the referring and you know it all worked out I'm like she got a lot of comments and a
[00:39:28.990] 做了推荐，你知道，一切都很顺利，我就像她收到了很多评论一样。
[00:39:33.470] lot of people were really more than happy to chat with her and talk about her work and all that
[00:39:33.470] 很多人都非常乐意和她聊天，谈论她的工作等等。
[00:39:39.950] she changed the meta yeah I mean I yeah I think it just ties back to the reaching out
[00:39:39.950] 她改变了元叙事，是的，我的意思是，是的，我认为这与伸出援手有关。
[00:39:45.710] worst thing they can say is no and I think we're eventually gonna get there but yeah
[00:39:45.710] 最坏的结果也就是被拒绝，我觉得我们最终会成功的，但是，嗯。
[00:39:49.790] it's just people are more than more than happy to help most of the time yeah I feel like
[00:39:49.790] 感觉大多数时候人们都非常乐意帮忙。
[00:39:53.870] both jobs I've had so far or all three I've had has been through people that I talked to
[00:39:53.870] 我目前为止的两份工作，或者说我所有的三份工作，都是通过我交谈过的人介绍的。
[00:39:58.510] beforehand and they happen to know somebody at the company or whatever and then I would always name
[00:39:58.510] 事先安排好，他们碰巧认识公司里的某个人，或者其他什么人，然后我总是会提到他们的名字。
[00:40:04.750] drop them basically throughout all my interviews well thank you so much Harpreet for joining us
[00:40:04.750] 基本上我在所有采访中都提到了它们。非常感谢哈普里特接受我们的采访。

[00:40:14.510] 今天我觉得我们的谈话真的帮助我转变了对……的看法。
[00:40:21.310] networking as I mentioned earlier in the episode I you know was kind of afraid of the word and
[00:40:21.310] 正如我在本集前面提到的，我其实有点害怕“人脉”这个词。
[00:40:26.350] and I always associated it with kind of like what Jisoo said transactions and super proper
[00:40:26.350] 我一直把它和Jisoo说的那种交易以及非常正式的事情联系起来。
[00:40:32.750] super professional environments but you know after we talked through it I'm realizing that
[00:40:32.750] 非常专业的环境，但你知道，在我们讨论之后，我意识到……
