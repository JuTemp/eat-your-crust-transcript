[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crest Podcast. I'm Jisoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jen.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“Eat Your Crest”播客。我是Jisoo。我是Crystal。我是Jen。
[00:00:16.480] Before we get started on our topic today, we have a fun Gen Z word to talk about.
[00:00:16.480] 在开始今天的主题之前，我们先来聊聊一个有趣的Z世代词汇。
[00:00:23.760] I think this is like low-key a made-up word because I saw one TikTok about it where someone was like, oh, an industry insider tip to looking good in photos, and they described the mewing technique. And then after that, everyone was obsessed with mewing. So then now I think it became this whole meme, where if someone is looking really snatched on the red carpet and their jawline looks really good,
[00:00:23.760] 我觉得“mewing”这个词有点像是人为造出来的，因为我在TikTok上看到有人说，这是业内人士分享的拍照秘诀，讲的就是“mewing”这个技巧。之后，大家都开始迷恋“mewing”了。现在它好像成了一种梗，如果有人在红毯上看起来特别精致，下颌线条特别好，
[00:01:43.000] all the comments will be like, oh, bro's mewing. She's m or something. But yeah, and then all these TikToks started popping up. That's like, this is how you knew. I think I tried it once I was looking in the mirror and I was like, I don't know if I'm doing this right. I don't know if this is working. Dude. So I also tried it, right. And I was looking at my side profile in the mirror and for some reason,
[00:01:43.000] 所有评论都会是这样的，哦，兄弟在练舌位了。她好像在练m之类的。不过，然后各种TikTok视频就开始冒出来了。就好像，这就是你知道的途径。我想我试过一次，当时我对着镜子，心想，我不知道我做得对不对。我不知道这有没有用。哥们儿。所以我也试了试，对吧。我看着镜子里的侧脸，不知怎么的，
[00:03:00.300] every time I knew, I think it pushes out everything that's
[00:03:00.300] 每次我知道的时候，我觉得它都会把一切都挤出去。
[00:03:03.759] supposed to be getting sucked in.
[00:03:03.759] 应该会被吸入其中。
[00:03:05.639] So it has the opposite effect for me.
[00:03:05.639] 所以对我来说，它的效果恰恰相反。
[00:04:05.840] minimal which is good and then I have like kind of the middle right okay and then Jisoo has like a tie that's closer to the tip of her tongue so someone needs
[00:04:05.840] 极简主义很好，然后我感觉中间偏右一点，Jisoo 的舌头好像有条靠近舌尖的结，所以有人需要
[00:04:09.819] to invent a fucking technique for mewing that tongue-tied people can also do
[00:04:09.819] 发明一种连舌系带过短的人也能做的舌位训练技巧
[00:04:14.919] shout out to all my tongue-tied people out there but dude I love this mewing
[00:04:14.919] 向所有和我一样说话结巴的朋友们致敬！老兄，我太爱这种舌位训练了！
[00:04:19.819] meme because I feel like it's just evolved from a photography modeling then we're like, wow, we understand football. And then after the Super Bowl, I proceeded to watch like, four hours of TikTok about football. I could totally be a sports girl. Wait, I can't believe that person didn't answer your questions. Wait, yeah. Dude, yeah. Because by the time it was like end of the game overtime, or OT.
[00:04:19.819] 我觉得这个梗就像是从摄影模特发展而来的，然后我们突然意识到，哇，我们居然懂橄榄球了。超级碗之后，我连续看了四个小时的TikTok橄榄球视频。我完全可以成为一个体育迷。等等，我简直不敢相信那个人居然没回答你的问题。等等，是啊。兄弟，是啊。因为到了比赛最后阶段，也就是加时赛的时候……
[00:05:45.279] As the fans call it OT.
[00:05:45.279] 正如球迷们所说的加时赛。
[00:06:41.240] No, I'm with you though. A lot of the times they could have just run the ball.
[00:06:41.240] 不，我同意你的看法。很多时候他们本来可以直接跑球的。
[00:06:44.279] I obviously know the strategy after watching one game.
[00:06:44.279] 看完一场比赛，我当然就知道了战术。
[00:06:50.480] No, I literally had the same exact comment.
[00:06:50.480] 不，我当时也说了完全一样的话。
[00:06:52.480] I was like, why don't they just run it down?
[00:06:52.480] 我当时就想，他们为什么不直接把它撞倒呢？
[00:06:54.519] Like, why do they keep ramming themselves into the defense?
[00:06:54.519] 他们为什么总是猛烈撞击对方的防守？
[00:06:58.639] Yeah.
[00:06:58.639] 是的。
[00:06:58.839] And like, why can't they just catch the ball?
[00:06:58.839] 为什么他们就不能接住球呢？
[00:07:00.600] Like, could it really be that hard?
[00:07:00.600] 难道真的有那么难吗？
[00:07:03.120] Okay, wait though, like how sad are your friends about the Niners losing? have a friend who's like a huge 49ers fan and during the Super Bowl towards the end we're like oh I'm kind of scared to like say stuff in the group chat. The group chat got so quiet after they lost. Dude, that's so sad. But you're right I was also thinking about that. It's like damn these people get really invested in sports and it's a lot of
[00:07:03.120] 等等，你朋友们对49人队输球有多难过？我有个朋友是49人队的铁杆球迷，超级碗快结束的时候，我们都有点不敢在群聊里说什么。他们输球之后，群聊里就鸦雀无声了。老兄，这太让人难过了。不过你说得对，我也在想这个问题。这些人对体育真的太投入了，而且投入程度很高。
[00:08:23.639] a lot of feelings maybe that's where they channel all their feelings. flexibility, working remotely and working from home and that kind of flexibility in our lives. So I guess to start us off, how flexible is your current day job in terms of like work locations, working from home, working from anywhere? Yeah so I work fully remote and my company has a policy where you can work
[00:08:23.639] 或许他们把很多情绪都倾注在那里。灵活办公、远程办公、在家办公等等，这些灵活性在我们的生活中都非常重要。所以我想先问一下，你目前的工作在工作地点、在家办公、随时随地办公等方面有多灵活？是的，我完全远程办公，我们公司有一项政策，允许员工远程办公。
[00:09:42.960] 30 days away from home. So I've used this policy when I was in Europe. And I think I worked like 10 to six, which isn't too bad. Then four weeks working pretty regular hours, hanging out with friends after work and then on the weekends, then two weeks vacation. So it wasn't too much of a transition, I would say.
[00:09:42.960] 离家30天。我在欧洲的时候就用过这种休假方式。我记得当时是朝九晚六，还不错。然后接下来的四周工作时间比较规律，下班后和周末可以和朋友们聚会，之后再休两周假。所以我觉得过渡期并不长。
[00:11:00.220] It was just like a different location,
[00:11:00.220] 感觉就像到了另一个地方。
[00:11:01.919] but it was still a familiar location
[00:11:01.919] 但那仍然是一个熟悉的地方。
[00:11:04.159] because I had lived there for two years beforehand. I always feel like sometimes it is nice to go in the office, but like having the flexibility, of course, is like the ultimate goal. Yeah. So my office is in New York, so I don't usually go into the office unless they like fly me out. At the end of my Europe trip in 2022, I was actually planning, quotes,
[00:11:04.159] 因为我之前在那里住了两年。我总觉得有时候去办公室上班挺好的，但当然，拥有灵活性才是最终目标。是的。我的办公室在纽约，所以除非他们安排我飞过去，否则我通常不会去办公室。2022年欧洲之旅结束时，我其实在计划……报价……
[00:12:22.779] planning to move to New York afterwards.
[00:12:22.779] 之后计划搬到纽约。
[00:13:26.120] working from home. So I think it would be actually kind of interesting to work in office more regularly, but maybe for the future.
[00:13:26.120] 在家办公。所以我觉得，以后或许可以更规律地去办公室上班，但这也许要等到以后了。
[00:13:30.100] You know, I've been kind of reminiscing on like pre-COVID work life lately. And there
[00:13:30.100] 你知道吗，我最近一直在怀念疫情前的工作生活。
[00:13:35.399] was something special about being in office five days a week before COVID that I feel
[00:13:35.399] 在新冠疫情之前，每周五天在办公室上班有一种特别的氛围，我觉得
[00:13:41.480] like will just never come back ever again.'s only so many days that you go in and have the possibility of seeing other people. I always feel bad when I like go into the office maybe to like pick something up and then like go home and I see someone and they're like oh hey what's up and I'm like hey my backpack is on and I'm like getting ready
[00:13:41.480] 感觉以后再也不会回来了。你只有那么几天能去上班，有机会见到其他人。每次我去办公室，可能只是拿点东西，然后回家，看到某个人，他们跟我打招呼，我就觉得很不好意思。我回答说，嘿，我的背包背好了，我正在准备下班。
[00:15:00.200] to leave you know and this is like the first time I've seen them all week I'm
[00:15:00.200] 你知道，要离开了，这好像是我这周第一次见到他们。
[00:15:03.279] like haha hey.
[00:15:03.279] 哈哈，嘿。
[00:15:04.840] Yeah it's interesting I feel you make your desk really comfortable and like, sit down in it, you recognize everything, it feels very familiar.
[00:15:04.840] 是的，这很有意思。我觉得你把办公桌布置得非常舒适，然后你坐上去，你会觉得一切都很熟悉，感觉非常亲切。
[00:16:21.100] It is easier, I've noticed, to like, get into the rhythm of things quicker, get into the
[00:16:21.100] 我注意到，这样更容易更快地进入状态，更快地融入……
[00:16:25.759] zone, I guess.
[00:16:25.759] 我猜是区域。
[00:16:26.759] Yeah, that makes sense. like New York apartments are small so I was just like working in my bedroom and every time I would kind of like turn around look at my bed and be like wow working in a room with a bed is so like distracting. I'm just thinking about like crawling into bed and like putting pulling up some shows or something and like definitely not being productive. You're right I think having that
[00:16:26.759] 是啊，有道理。纽约的公寓都很小，所以我只能在卧室里工作。每次我转身看到床，都会想：哇，在有床的房间里工作太容易分心了。我满脑子想的都是爬到床上，打开电视看剧什么的，肯定没法好好工作。你说得对，我觉得有床确实会分心。
[00:17:42.720] separation is definitely helpful. I feel like something that I've it up, I'm like, okay, my head is clear and I can live my life again. Agreed. When there's so much glitter, you're like, oh fuck, this is a sign. Life is getting too hectic right now. But I do wonder, have you all worked while traveling before? I guess, Jen, you said you did work remotely abroad for a couple weeks before taking a
[00:17:42.720] 分开一段时间绝对有帮助。我觉得一旦把事情处理好，我的头脑就会清醒，我可以重新开始生活了。没错。当周围都是闪闪发光的东西时，你会想，哦，天哪，这是个征兆。现在的生活太忙碌了。不过我很好奇，你们以前有没有边旅行边工作过？珍，你之前说过你在国外远程工作了几个星期，然后……
[00:19:03.759] couple weeks vacation. Sometimes I feel like because I'm traveling, my priority in that moment feels like travel and not work. So then if I have like meetings and stuff on like a day where I'm working from like a different location, I feel like it's getting in the way of my life, even though it's fully like within work hours. So that's the one thing I feel like my attitude does change a little bit.
[00:19:03.759] 休假两周。有时候我觉得，因为在旅行，我当时的首要任务似乎是旅行而不是工作。所以，如果我在某个时候需要在其他地方远程办公，并且有会议之类的安排，我就会觉得这影响了我的生活，即使这些事情完全在工作时间内。所以，我觉得我的态度确实会因此而略有改变。
[00:20:20.200] Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:20:20.200] 嗯，我觉得这很合理。
[00:20:21.960] Because you're kind of like, oh, I'm in a new spot like new place, I should definitely
[00:20:21.960] 因为你感觉就像，哦，我到了一个新地方，一个全新的地方，我肯定应该……
[00:20:25.240] be enjoying it or you know,'m on this call as well. So after that, I was just like, okay, I'm never doing that ever again. Oh my god, that sounds horrible.
[00:20:25.240] 要么你乐在其中，要么你也知道，我也在参与这个通话。所以在那之后，我就想，好吧，我再也不这么做了。我的天哪，听起来太可怕了。
[00:21:40.039] That reminds me of this hour, I've gotten like three or four pings from this director about, hey can we talk about this? Oh, I can actually meet at 6 p.m my time or like whatever and basically I get off the plane, I've missed this impromptu meeting and I have like DM'd this person that I haven't worked with
[00:21:40.039] 这让我想起刚才的事，那位导演给我发了三四条消息，问我能不能聊聊这个。他说我可以下午六点（我这边的时间）见面，或者其他什么时间。结果我一下飞机就错过了这个临时会议，然后我给这位之前没合作过的人发了私信。
[00:23:03.920] before being like, oh sorry I missed this, can we actually do right now? Anyways know we're in the meeting blah blah and then someone's like oh Crystal they said something about like being in the office so I guess they assumed I was in the office because people were walking behind me so they're like oh if you're in the office can you like ask this person about what like whatever and I was like oh I'm not in the office but I
[00:23:03.920] 我之前还说，哦，抱歉我错过了，我们现在可以开始吗？总之，现在我们在开会，等等等等，然后有人说，哦，Crystal，他们说好像是在办公室，所以我猜他们以为我在办公室，因为有人从我身后走过，所以他们就说，哦，如果你在办公室，你能问问这个人什么事吗？我回答说，哦，我不在办公室，但是……
[00:24:24.220] didn't know if I should say I was at the airport or not I was supposed to work for like a week in Taiwan, work my hours or whatever. Luckily I got to work UK hours so like I got to stop at 12 but I remember the next day I woke up and I was just like I cannot do anything right now. I am just so my body is shutting down. Yeah yeah that was horrible. Oh my god. Did you take a sick day? Yeah like I tried to month and then people kept booking him for East Coast meetings so he would just have calendar blocks every day that said like unavailable please do not book unavailable in all caps in brackets and then please do not book is like regular yeah so then usually if I have to do
[00:24:24.220] 我不知道该不该说我在机场，我本来应该在台湾工作一个星期，按时上下班什么的。还好我上了英国的时区，所以12点就下班了。但我记得第二天早上醒来，我就感觉自己什么都做不了，身体完全垮了。是啊，太难受了。我的天哪。你请病假了吗？嗯，我试着请了一个月，但人们一直给他安排东海岸的会议，所以他每天的日历上都会显示“不可用，请勿预订”之类的字样，用大写字母括起来，“不可用”后面还加了括号，然后“请勿预订”就跟平常一样。所以，通常情况下，如果我必须……
[00:27:00.519] something I'll just be like unavailable please do not book So I'm like setting up hotspot on my phone to like, you know, call in on the on the call. And then at one point, my skip is just like, you know, you keep cutting out. So why don't we just end this meeting and then you can update me offline? Because it seems like everything's fine. I was like, Oh my god, thank God, like, why didn't I just cancel this meeting?
[00:27:00.519] 我当时就说“无法接听，请勿预约”，然后我就用手机开热点，想拨进去。结果通话进行到一半，我的通话突然断断续续的。所以我就想，不如我们结束这个会议，你之后可以线下告诉我情况，因为看起来一切都正常。我当时就想，天哪，谢天谢地，我怎么没直接取消这个会议呢？
[00:28:22.960] I had a similar experience. I guess it's not people's screens, all of their shit was loading and I'm like, why? Why do they hate me? And then like, we hit turbulence and literally nothing is working. I'm just gonna shut my laptop anyways. Like this is a travel day. Like I don't have to get anything done. Whatever.
[00:28:22.960] 我也有过类似的经历。我猜应该不是别人的屏幕问题，他们的东西都在加载，我就纳闷了，为什么？他们是不是跟我过不去？然后飞机就遇到气流颠簸，所有东西都彻底卡住了。反正我也打算关掉电脑了。今天是旅行日，我又不是非得干什么。算了。
[00:30:42.000] I'm like, what's the T in this company?
[00:30:42.000] 我心想，这家公司里的“T”到底是什么？
[00:30:45.500] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:30:45.500] 等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:30:50.299] But I am kind of curious since we've mentioned working in these different locations and working while traveling.
[00:30:50.299] 但我有点好奇，因为我们提到了在这些不同的地方工作以及边旅行边工作。
[00:30:53.000] I think another big thing that could be an important point is equipment.
[00:30:53.000] 我认为另一个非常重要的方面是设备。
[00:30:58.400] So anything like a wireless keyboard, a wireless mouse, a webcam sometimes,
[00:30:58.400] 所以像无线键盘、无线鼠标、网络摄像头之类的东西，有时候也算在内。
[00:31:04.000] or even monitors and things like that.
[00:31:04.000] 甚至包括显示器之类的东西。
[00:32:06.640] I think for the most part, I also only bring my laptop, but the exception is when I go to visit my parents in Dallas, they have like a little desk setup.
[00:32:06.640] 我觉得大多数情况下我也只带笔记本电脑，但例外情况是我去达拉斯看望父母时，他们那里有一张小桌子。
[00:32:10.559] So then I'll always bring my webcam, because I can place that on top of the monitor that
[00:32:10.559] 所以，我总是会带着我的网络摄像头，因为我可以把它放在显示器上面。
[00:32:14.519] I use.
[00:32:14.519] 我用。
[00:32:15.640] And I'll bring my keyboard and mouse.
[00:32:15.640] 我会带上我的键盘和鼠标。
[00:32:17.880] Wait, what if crazy idea, but what if your parents kept a set of keyboard and mice for
[00:32:17.880] 等等，有个疯狂的想法，如果你的父母一直保存着一套键盘和鼠标呢？
[00:32:24.359] you at the place?
[00:32:24.359] 你在现场吗？
[00:32:26.079] Are you nuts?
[00:32:26.079] 你疯了吗？
[00:32:28.799] That's true. during COVID and then it was like, oh, if you need anything, just go into the office and grab it. And like when I was in the office, I was like, should I take my monitor? Did I take this standing desk? The standing desk is crazy. No, it was like an attachment. So it's not like the whole desk. It's just something that went on top. I was like, Damn, you're strong as hell. I was like, she really
[00:32:28.799] 没错。疫情期间，他们就说，哦，如果你需要什么，就去办公室拿。就像我当时在办公室，我就想，我该带显示器吗？我该带那个站立式办公桌吗？那个站立式办公桌太疯狂了。不，它只是个附加组件。所以它不是整张桌子。它只是放在桌子上面的一个部件。我当时就想，哇，你力气真大。我当时就想，她真的
[00:33:43.599] pulled up in a U-Haul.
[00:33:43.599] 开着一辆U-Haul搬家车来了。
[00:33:47.079] Honestly, though, the funny thing to me about like this like time right so what I end up doing is I drive all the way to therapy and I sit in my car and I dial in from my car and then like the moment the meeting ends I'm like slamming my laptop down like running into therapy like one minute late or something normally I never have like a virtual background but because I'm like literally in my car I'm like okay I need to like you know
[00:33:47.079] 说实话，我觉得这种时候最搞笑的就是，我开车去咨询室，坐在车里，用手机连线，然后咨询一结束，我就赶紧把笔记本电脑摔在地上，像个小疯子一样冲进咨询室，可能迟到了一分钟什么的。平时我从来不用虚拟背景，但因为我当时真的在车里，我就想，好吧，我得……
[00:35:02.320] put put some kind of virtual background here so I always like a couple months leading up to wherever they were going. And then wouldn't be seen as weird that they started using this virtual background. That's clever. They were planning in advance. Yeah, he's probably wondering like, Oh, where are they?
[00:35:02.320] 放个虚拟背景图，我通常会提前几个月就放上去。这样他们开始用这个虚拟背景图就不会显得奇怪了。这招挺聪明的。他们提前计划好了。是啊，他可能在想，哦，他们在哪儿呢？
[00:36:22.679] Probably one of those.
[00:36:22.679] 很可能是其中之一。
[00:36:25.639] The extra caution.
[00:36:25.639] 格外谨慎。
[00:36:27.199] That's true. If you're the type to judge that you know how to corner of my room. And then it's like outside of therapy. So like the best lighting ever like super clear. So it's a pretty funny contrast. They're like, Oh, she opened her window. Glass skin who? Once I had a 7.30am analytics all hands meeting, and I had to like talk
[00:36:27.199] 没错。如果你是那种喜欢评判别人的人，那你肯定知道怎么在我房间的角落里观察。然后就像在治疗室外一样。光线好得不得了，超级清晰。所以这对比挺搞笑的。他们会说，哦，她打开了窗户。玻璃皮肤？谁啊？有一次我早上7点半要开一个分析部门的全体员工会议，我得跟他们聊聊。
[00:37:42.400] during it because we have these like quiz breaks or whatever. And first of all, I need to like pretend it's West Coast time right now. Like need it to look super bright. But I also noticed, I think my manager has like caught on to some of my, I don't know, I guess like not the best calling in on meeting habits because sometimes if I'm running late, I'll just like call into a meeting while I'm
[00:37:42.400] 期间我们会有小测验之类的环节。首先，我得假装现在是西海岸时间，让时间看起来格外明亮。但我还注意到，我的经理好像也发现了我的一些不太好的会议通话习惯，因为有时候如果我迟到了，我就会直接打电话加入会议。
[00:39:00.900] driving and then I go camera off and like mute usually, but normally, you
[00:39:00.900] 开车的时候，我通常会关掉摄像头，然后把麦克风静音，但一般情况下，你
[00:39:06.320] know, I always have my camera on.
[00:39:06.320] 我知道，我的相机一直开着。
[00:40:00.880] More engagement. So I was kind of like still parked, but like getting ready to drive,
[00:40:00.880] 更多互动。所以我当时车还停着，但正准备开车，
[00:40:04.000] making small talk and I was driving James's car, you know, like the Tesla sounds,
[00:40:04.000] 我们闲聊着，我当时开着詹姆斯的车，你知道，就是特斯拉那种声音。
[00:40:09.039] like, you know how it makes noises?
[00:40:09.039] 你知道它是怎么发出声音的吗？
[00:40:11.199] It's like, ding, you know, like the Tesla sound.
[00:40:11.199] 就像，叮的一声，你知道，就像特斯拉的引擎声。
[00:40:12.960] Oh, yeah.
[00:40:12.960] 哦，是的。
[00:40:13.920] Like when the green light comes up.
[00:40:13.920] 就像绿灯亮起的时候一样。
[00:40:15.599] Yeah.
[00:40:15.599] 是的。
[00:40:16.159] So it kept making that sound and I was like, holy fuck.
[00:40:16.159] 它一直发出那种声音，我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:40:19.119] And I was like, oh, I'm gonna like go on mute for a little bit, but I hope
[00:40:19.119] 我当时就想，哦，我得暂时静音一会儿，但我希望
[00:40:22.320] other people dial in soon and I just muted myself.
[00:40:22.320] 其他人很快也拨了进来，我就把自己静音了。
[00:41:22.860] something that we're lucky to have, but also at the end of the day,
[00:41:22.860] 我们很幸运拥有它，但归根结底，
[00:41:25.599] like we have our own lives and stuff.
[00:41:25.599] 就像我们都有自己的生活一样。
[00:41:27.320] So I also feel like it could be more of a right
[00:41:27.320] 所以我觉得这或许更像是一种权利
[00:41:29.460] than a privilege.
[00:41:29.460] 与其说是一种特权，不如说是一种荣誉。
[00:41:30.519] What do you guys think?
[00:41:30.519] 你们觉得怎么样？
[00:41:31.920] I think that's interesting.
[00:41:31.920] 我觉得这很有意思。
[00:41:33.219] I mean, I definitely think it's a privilege
[00:41:33.219] 我的意思是，我绝对认为这是一种荣幸。
[00:41:36.280] that we can do it with so much flexibility.
[00:41:36.280] 我们可以非常灵活地做到这一点。
[00:41:39.639] I also think though that like remote work was a thing
[00:41:39.639] 不过我也觉得远程办公曾经是一种潮流。
[00:41:43.320] even before COVID, at least at my old company,
[00:41:43.320] 即使在新冠疫情之前，至少在我以前的公司也是如此。
[00:41:47.000] there were definitely people that worked remotely, managers and their direct reports and stuff. In that sense, I can say like, maybe it feels more like a, I don't know if it's necessarily a right, but it almost feels like we earned the right through trust, right? But I guess I can't really say much about, you know, the overall like corporate opinion on it. Honestly, like, I think I work way better at home than I would in an office, even though
[00:41:47.000] 确实有人远程办公，包括经理和他们的下属等等。从这个角度来说，我觉得远程办公更像是一种……我不知道这算不算一种权利，但感觉我们好像是通过信任赢得了这项权利，对吧？不过，我不太了解公司整体对此的看法。说实话，我觉得我在家工作效率比在办公室高得多，尽管……
[00:43:04.679] I don't really know. work best in different environments? I think honestly too, what I really appreciate is being able to work while traveling. I mean, what is just fun and nice to kind of switch up the environment from time to time? Sometimes it's just logistically more convenient that way. But I think also knowing that your team and your manager
[00:43:04.679] 我不太清楚。在不同的环境下工作效果更好？说实话，我觉得我最欣赏的是能够边旅行边工作。我的意思是，时不时地换换环境，岂不是很有趣很惬意？有时候这样在后勤方面也更方便。但我觉得，知道你的团队和经理都在身边也很重要。
[00:44:20.360] trust you to the point where they're fine with you
[00:44:20.360] 他们信任你，甚至对你很放心。
[00:44:22.320] working from some remote location for a little bit, Sometimes it's just nice to like sit with friends and you know, everyone just focuses on their work, get shit done. And then they're like, okay, cool. We can go out and like party after. It's like a nice reward. I think I agree with what you both said. Um, it's just really nice to like feel that trust and you're right. It does kind of encourage you to work harder.
[00:44:22.320] 远程办公一段时间后，有时候和朋友们坐在一起，大家各自专注于自己的工作，高效完成任务，感觉真的很好。然后他们会说：“好，太棒了！我们可以出去玩玩。”这就像是种不错的奖励。我觉得你们俩说的都对。嗯，感受到这种信任真的很好，你说得对，这确实会激励你更加努力工作。
[00:45:40.039] Like, oh yeah, these people trust me.
[00:45:40.039] 哦，是的，这些人信任我。
[00:45:41.719] So let me show them that they can continue to trust me.
[00:45:41.719] 所以，让我来证明他们可以继续信任我。
[00:45:45.199] But I do think a lot of this like work stuff, most of the experience, the office girly experience. But then, then after I've done that for a year, I can go back to being a remote employee. Yeah, that makes total sense. Yeah, I feel like when a company adds that benefit, I know it's just kind of like an HR thing, but it does make me feel like they actually give a shit about their employees.
[00:45:45.199] 但我确实觉得这很多都跟工作有关，大部分经验，也就是办公室女性的那些经历。不过，等我干满一年之后，我就可以重新做回远程员工了。嗯，这完全说得通。是啊，我觉得公司提供这种福利，我知道这只是人力资源部门的举措，但确实让我觉得他们真的关心员工。
[00:47:01.280] For a really long time, I feel like it was expected that people were living to work,
[00:47:01.280] 很长一段时间以来，我觉得人们似乎都认为生活就是为了工作。
