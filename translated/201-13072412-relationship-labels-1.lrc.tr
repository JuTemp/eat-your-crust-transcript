[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Michelle. And I'm Eric. So welcome back, Michelle. The last episode Michelle was on with us was actually episode 188,
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Michelle。我是Eric。欢迎Michelle回来。Michelle上次和我们一起录制节目是第188期。
[00:00:25.230] Keeping Up With Your Old Work Connections. And she also had joined us way, way, way back towards the beginning of the podcast, episode 19, Welcome to the LDR Club. We talked about being in a long distance relationship. And Eric is her boyfriend that we talked about on that episode. So welcome, Eric. Thank you. Thank you. Episode 19, double digits. It was so long ago. I'm a vet. I'm a
[00:00:25.230] 维系旧工作关系。她还曾参与过我们很久很久以前的播客节目，第19期，《欢迎加入异地恋俱乐部》。我们聊了聊异地恋。埃里克就是我们在那期节目里提到的她的男朋友。欢迎你，埃里克。谢谢。谢谢。第19期，两位数了。真是好久以前的事了。我是一名兽医。我是一名
[00:00:54.990] Eat Your Crust vet. You've been here since the beginning. Yeah. Yeah, welcome, Eric. Thank you. Thank you. I'm excited to be here. So honored. It took Eric so long. He had to move back to the bay first and then acquaint himself with us. And now he's finally on the pod. The long awaited LDR reveal. Yeah, you're right. We were long distance. The last time we chatted about Eric, it was mentioned. And
[00:00:54.990] 《吃掉你的面包皮》老将。你从一开始就在这里了。是的。是的，欢迎你，埃里克。谢谢。谢谢。我很高兴来到这里。非常荣幸。埃里克花了很长时间才来。他得先搬回湾区，然后才能和我们熟悉起来。现在他终于来到播客了。期待已久的异地恋揭晓。是的，你说得对。我们是异地恋。上次我们聊到埃里克的时候，也提到了这件事。
[00:01:23.730] now we live together. So before we dive into today's topic, I have a Gen Z phrase of the day. Oh boy. And the phrase is understood slash understanding the assignment. So I feel like this one is also one of those phrases that is generally easier to understand when you see
[00:01:23.730] 现在我们住在一起。所以在深入探讨今天的话题之前，我先来分享一个Z世代常用语。哎呀。这个短语是“理解/理解任务”。我觉得这个短语也是那种当你看到……的时候更容易理解的短语之一。
[00:01:50.050] it in context. Because usually it's like a comment and it's like, oh my god, so and so understood the assignment, which basically means that they did exactly what you would have hoped them to do and really well as well. Yeah. No, immediately comes to mind is when I had a gallons day, Calentine's day party. And then I was like, you got to wear pink and red. And everyone wore pink and
[00:01:50.050] 把它放在语境里。因为通常情况下，这就像一条评论，比如，“我的天哪，某某居然理解了任务”，这基本上意味着他们不仅完全按照你的期望完成了任务，而且还做得非常好。是的。不，我立刻想到的是我举办的那个“加仑日”（Gallons Day），也就是情人节派对。然后我说，你们要穿粉色和红色。结果每个人都穿了粉色和红色。
[00:02:15.010] red, including Crystal, who doesn't wear pink. So Crystal understood the assignment. You know who didn't understand the assignment? My friend Tiff Tosh showed up in all black. Tiff did not understand the assignment. Great example. Yeah. I think my first exposure to this phrase is through that song that I know is like, is the audio for a lot of TikToks. It's like, I understood the assignment. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And it's super catchy. So when I first heard it, it was just like stuck in my head
[00:02:15.010] 所有人都穿了红色，包括Crystal，她从来不穿粉色。所以Crystal理解了任务。你知道谁没理解任务吗？我的朋友Tiff Tosh，她一身黑就来了。Tiff没理解任务。真是个好例子。是啊。我第一次听到这句话，好像是通过那首歌，很多TikTok视频的配乐都是这首歌。歌词是这样的：“我理解了任务。嗯哼。嗯哼。”而且这首歌超级洗脑。所以我第一次听到它的时候，它就一直在我脑子里挥之不去。
[00:02:44.870] all the time. I don't know why like this, this phrase is hard for me to use in real life. Like it just doesn't stick to my tongue. So I just always had the song running, but was never able to like verbalize it or use the phrase. I feel like I've mostly seen it just in like context of like Instagram reels or TikToks too, where just people are like either playing pranks on each other or doing something stupid. The people who play along, they just say like, oh yeah,
[00:02:44.870] 一直都是这样。我不知道为什么，这句话在现实生活中对我来说很难说出口。就像它总是说不出口一样。所以我一直都听着这首歌，但却从来没能把它说出口。我觉得我主要是在Instagram Reels或者TikTok之类的视频里看到过这句话，就是人们互相恶作剧或者做些傻事的时候。那些配合的人就会说，哦，是啊，
[00:03:10.630] they understood the assignment. Yeah. So I guess it's mostly lives online, like usually comments, but I feel like it's not too bad to use it in person. Maybe it doesn't feel as like Gen Z when you say it out loud, but I feel like it would totally make sense. When I think of that term, I think of how like, I just immediately jumped to like if someone's on theme. So I did a little bit
[00:03:10.630] 他们理解了我的意思。是的。所以我觉得它主要在线上流行，比如评论，但我觉得当面用也还不错。也许说出来感觉不太像Z世代的风格，但我感觉完全说得通。我一想到这个词，就立刻想到，比如，如果有人说的话切题，我就会立刻想到。所以我稍微……
[00:03:34.350] of research and Jisoo, I think you're onto something because once again, we are referring to knowyourmeme.com. But it says, I understood the assignment is a song by musical artist Tay Money. Oh, that was released in 2021, September. And that song had a large amount of success on TikTok.
[00:03:34.350] 和Jisoo一起研究，我觉得你说的有道理，因为我们又一次提到了knowyourmeme.com。上面说，我理解的作业是一首音乐人Tay Money的歌。哦，那首歌是2021年9月发行的。而且那首歌在TikTok上非常火爆。
[00:03:58.230] And that might've been the origin. So it says like in August of 2021. So that's about one month before the song was released. The artist, she like posted something on TikTok, the hook of the song to build up hype and like get the marketing going. And that's when it first started going viral, apparently. Wow. Is that the song you're referencing, Jisoo? I think it is. Yeah. Eric, you know the song, right?
[00:03:58.230] 那可能就是起源。上面写着大概是2021年8月，也就是歌曲发行前一个月左右。这位歌手在TikTok上发布了歌曲的副歌部分，以此来造势，为宣传造势。据说，这首歌就是从那时开始走红的。哇。Jisoo，你说的就是这首歌吗？我觉得是。对。Eric，你知道这首歌吧？
[00:04:26.630] I don't. What are you do? I understood the assignment. Yeah. I have to hear it. I can't say I know off the top of my head. I'm so sorry to disappoint. It's okay. I also don't know this song at all. Just me and Michelle in the know. I'm just thinking in my head right now. I'm vibing to it. I know. Uh-huh. Just playing in my head. Yeah. Eric, you watch so much TikTok.
[00:04:26.630] 我不知道。你在做什么？我明白任务要求了。嗯。我得听听。我不能说我能马上记住。很抱歉让你失望了。没关系。我也完全不认识这首歌。只有我和米歇尔知道。我现在只是在脑子里想着。我跟着节奏哼唱。我知道。嗯哼。只是在脑子里循环播放。是啊。埃里克，你肯定看了不少TikTok。
[00:04:51.610] I don't, I'm not on TikTok. I just watch Instagram Reels. Eric, so yeah, that's the thing. We don't, we both don't have TikTok. So we're just- I'm like two weeks late. Yeah. Because we watch everything on Instagram Reels, but everything on TikTok makes its way in Instagram Reels. Before I watched TikTok, I actually used to watch like TikTok compilations on YouTube. YouTube. You're like, that's how you say I don't have TikTok, but you stay like relevant. So you like don't want to fully let yourself do that. That's so funny.
[00:04:51.610] 我不玩TikTok，我只看Instagram Reels。Eric，所以，就是这样。我们俩都没有TikTok账号。所以我们——我好像晚了两周才注意到。是啊。因为我们都在Instagram Reels上看视频，但TikTok上的所有内容最终都会出现在Instagram Reels里。在我开始看TikTok之前，我其实经常在YouTube上看TikTok的合集。YouTube。你就像这样，既能说自己没有TikTok，又能保持关注度。所以你不想完全沉迷其中。这太搞笑了。
[00:05:20.490] Yeah. But also it wasn't even like TikToks that would keep me in the know. It was like boring ass TikToks of like cleaning or like Amazon hauls or like stuff like that. Crystal, that is what you would watch? Yeah. And I was like, dude, I'm like such a boomer. Like TikTok grocery hauls. Yeah. Like organization. I mean, they were good TikToks, but I'm not learning any Gen Z slang from
[00:05:20.490] 是啊。但那些TikTok视频根本就不是那种能让我了解时事的。都是些无聊透顶的TikTok，比如打扫卫生、亚马逊购物分享之类的。Crystal，你居然看这些？对。我就想，老兄，我简直太老土了。就是那种TikTok购物分享。对，还有收纳整理之类的。我的意思是，那些TikTok视频确实不错，但我可学不到任何Z世代的俚语。
[00:05:48.790] them. Yeah. Okay. More on this know your meme page. It says September 2021. So that's now the song was released. A TikToker posted like a video of her weight loss journey and she used the song as the audio for it. And that one gained 5 million views in one month. So that might've been like what really, really spread it even more. And then now people just use understood the assignment. Dude. Nice.
[00:05:48.790] 他们。是的。好的。关于“了解你的梗”页面还有更多内容。上面写着2021年9月。所以这首歌就是那时候发布的。一位TikTok用户发布了一个关于她减肥历程的视频，并用这首歌作为配乐。那个视频在一个月内就获得了500万的观看量。所以这可能是真正让这首歌传播得更广的原因。然后现在人们就理解了这首歌的含义。老兄。不错。
[00:06:16.070] I think though, like there's just too many syllables on this phrase. You know what I mean? Like I would never say it because it's so long to say versus other Gen Z word, which is my favorite. Slay. It's one syllable. It's like so easy. Slip it in. Period. Yes, exactly. It's like quick and snippy phrases, right? Understood the assignment. It's like half my day is gone. Dude. That's a good point though. Slay is basically understood the assignment in one syllable, right?
[00:06:16.070] 我觉得这句话音节太多了。你懂我的意思吗？我肯定不会说，因为它太长了，不像其他Z世代的词，比如我最喜欢的“Slay”。它只有一个音节，简单易懂，说起来毫不费力。没错，就是这样。就像那种简洁明了的短语，对吧？“理解了任务”。感觉半天时间就这么过去了。老兄，你说得对。“Slay”基本上就是用一个音节表达“理解了任务”，对吧？
[00:06:44.990] True. Like Crystal Slayed at my Galatine's party with her big sweater. Yeah. But now I know like it needs to be less than three syllables for Jisoo to use it. When Jisoo's doing her vows, three syllables. Preferably just one. Preferably just one. She's just up there to slay. She's like, otherwise half my day is gone. And James just goes, slay. Right.
[00:06:44.990] 没错。就像Crystal穿着她那件大毛衣在我Galatine的派对上惊艳全场一样。是啊。不过现在我知道了，Jisoo用这个词的时候，音节必须少于三个。Jisoo宣誓的时候，三个音节。最好只有一个音节。最好只有一个音节。她上去就是要惊艳全场。她就像在说，不然我一天就白过了。然后James就说，惊艳全场。对。
[00:07:15.370] Then everyone just bawling, dude. Oh my God. It will be such an emotional wedding. That's crazy. That's heat. You have to do that now. Because we said it here on episode 201. You have to do that now. Now that you've said that, Jisoo, I'm surprised Gen Z used understood the assignment. Like they have the attention span to use the full phrase. I guess that's why it's only typed out for the moment.
[00:07:15.370] 然后大家都会哭得稀里哗啦的，老兄。我的天哪。那将会是一场多么感人的婚礼啊。太疯狂了。太火爆了。你现在必须这么做。因为我们在第201期节目里说过。你现在必须这么做。既然你都这么说了，Jisoo，我很惊讶Z世代居然理解了你的要求。他们居然能集中注意力把整句话都说完。我想这就是为什么目前只是打出来的原因吧。
[00:07:42.990] See, if this was a millennial phrase, it would definitely be an acronym. Oh. Oh, that's true. Huh. You're so right. Oh my God. UTA sounds too close to UTI. UTI. That's so funny. Yeah, we talked about this earlier in one of the episodes that Gen Z seems to not really use acronyms too much. But I think one that they do use is IYKYK. Yeah. They love that one. It's true.
[00:07:42.990] 你看，如果这是千禧一代的口头禅，那它肯定是个缩写。哦。哦，对。嗯。你说得太对了。我的天哪。UTA 听起来太像 UTI 了。UTI。真搞笑。是啊，我们之前在一期节目里也聊过，Z 世代好像不太用缩写。不过我觉得他们会用 IYKYK 这个。对。他们很喜欢这个。确实如此。
[00:08:12.890] It's true. I feel like they shorten words. It's true. A lot of them are just shortened. Like charisma to riz. Oh my God. I feel like we're having a review of like every week that we've done. This is like review for the quiz, guys. Yeah. I think I told Michelle about one. I don't know if people still use it, but people spell gym, like going to the gym as J-I-M. Like the name gym. Wait, what? Oh. Yeah. I don't think people, it's more of like a joke now, I feel. I don't think people use it as much.
[00:08:12.890] 没错。我觉得他们喜欢把单词缩写。真的。很多单词都被缩写了。比如把 charisma 缩写成 riz。我的天哪。感觉我们好像在回顾过去一周的内容。这简直就是小测验的复习啊，伙计们。是啊。我想我跟米歇尔说过一个。我不知道现在还有没有人这么拼，但以前有人会把 gym 拼成 J-I-M，比如去健身房。就像 gym 这个名字一样。等等，什么？哦。是啊。我觉得现在人们用这个拼写方式更多的是一种玩笑。我觉得现在很少有人这么拼了。
[00:08:41.390] But there's a period of time where I saw some people going like something related to the gym and they spell it like J-I-M. J-I-M. Yeah. Wow. Gen Z just owns words and changes them. Yeah. Who gave them the authority? Yeah. All right. Well, let's get to our topic of the week, which is relationship labels.
[00:08:41.390] 但有一段时间，我看到有些人把健身房的名字拼成J-I-M。J-I-M。哇哦。Z世代简直就是词语的掌控者，他们把词语改来改去。是啊。谁给了他们这种权力？好吧。那么，让我们进入本周的主题——恋爱关系标签。
[00:09:03.030] So part of the reason why we brought Michelle and Eric on is because they actually legalized their relationship kind of recently within the past year. Yep. Not marriage, but like just a legal relationship. So we wanted to talk about that. But before we get into the depths of that, let's talk a little bit about relationship labels in general. One question that I always like to ask people is what do you call your partner out in the wild?
[00:09:03.030] 我们邀请米歇尔和埃里克来做客的部分原因是，他们最近一年左右才正式确立了恋爱关系。没错，不是结婚，只是合法的恋爱关系。所以我们想聊聊这个话题。但在深入探讨之前，我们先来谈谈恋爱关系的称呼。我总是喜欢问大家的一个问题是：在公共场合，你会怎么称呼你的伴侣？
[00:09:32.710] Boyfriend, SO, girlfriend, you know, like what is the label you automatically attach to them? Right. Because Eric and I have been together almost 10 years. So when we say girlfriend, boyfriend, it sounds a little bit like, you know, it's like girlfriend, boyfriend. Like we've like that's what we were calling each other when we were 16, too. But then now we're like, we're not ready to be married, you know, like wife, husband. No. So I use partner most of the time.
[00:09:32.710] 男朋友、伴侣、女朋友，你知道，你会习惯性地给他们贴上什么标签？对。因为我和埃里克在一起快十年了。所以当我们说“女朋友”、“男朋友”的时候，听起来有点像，你知道，就像“女朋友”、“男朋友”一样。就像我们16岁的时候也是这么称呼彼此的。但现在我们觉得，我们还没准备好结婚，你知道，还没准备好说“妻子”、“丈夫”之类的。不。所以我大多数时候都用“伴侣”这个词。
[00:10:01.990] But then it also sounds like we're cowboys. Yeah, I say partner. What I've used that before. I've had people say, you know, when you say partner, you sound a little gay because it's not gendered. So I'm just going to kind of refer to when I moved back from Chicago to here, because when I was in grad school, I was just like girlfriend. When I started working in San Francisco, particularly, I did like my clinicals, other places, too.
[00:10:01.990] 但这样听起来又像我们是牛仔。对，我说的是“伴侣”。我以前也用过这个词。有人说，你知道，你说“伴侣”的时候，听起来有点像同性恋，因为它没有性别之分。所以我就简单说说我从芝加哥搬回来的时候，因为我读研究生的时候，就叫她“女朋友”。尤其是在旧金山开始工作的时候，我很喜欢我的临床实习，其他地方也一样。
[00:10:30.370] But particularly San Francisco, everyone would refer to girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever it is, as their partner, regardless of sex. So I was like, I didn't know if it was a San Francisco thing or if it was just because we're getting older or whatnot, too. But anyways, yeah, so everyone started saying partner. And similar to what Michelle said, I think a lot of my patients who are just older tend to try to say like partner instead just because it sounds more mature. Every way what Michelle said, girlfriend, boyfriend seems a little bit young of a thing to say.
[00:10:30.370] 但尤其是在旧金山，大家都会用“伴侣”来指代女朋友、男朋友之类的，不管性别。所以我就想，我不知道这是旧金山特有的现象，还是因为我们年纪大了之类的原因。总之，大家都开始用“伴侣”这个词了。就像米歇尔说的那样，我觉得我很多年纪稍长的病人也倾向于用“伴侣”这个词，因为听起来更成熟。反正米歇尔说的“女朋友”、“男朋友”听起来有点太幼稚了。
[00:10:57.990] Or just like, I don't know if immature is the right word, but just not as sophisticated. And so they just say partner. Yeah, especially like at work, they don't know who I'm with. So I said partner before and they're like, oh, I hope they are your partner. They are OK because they don't know. Right, right. Don't assume. They don't assume. You can't assume. That's true. That's true. I'm just imagining Eric like moving back to the Bay and he's like, oh, is everyone I'm meeting just like gay?
[00:10:57.990] 或者说，我不知道用“不成熟”这个词是否合适，但就是没那么世故。所以他们就直接说“伴侣”。是啊，尤其是在工作场合，他们不知道我跟谁在一起。所以我之前说了“伴侣”，他们就会说，哦，我希望他们真的是你的伴侣。他们没事，因为他们不知道。对，对。别妄下结论。他们也不会妄下结论。你不能妄下结论。没错。没错。我脑补了一下埃里克搬回湾区，然后他会想，哦，我遇到的每个人是不是都是同性恋？
[00:11:28.190] Dude, no lie. I wasn't sure for a lot of people. And I would also say that. I'd be like, oh, aren't they something? And for many times I would still not know until they said I used a pronoun. And I was like, oh, OK. Yeah. So I don't think there's a perfect word term. Yeah. Whatever you're comfortable with. You know what's interesting, though? I had a thought. So like, yeah, partner, SO are like a little more vague in terms of gender of your partner.
[00:11:28.190] 兄弟，说真的。我以前也搞不清楚很多人的性别。我自己也会这么说。我会想，哦，他们是不是……？很多时候，直到他们告诉我我用了代词，我才恍然大悟。然后我就想，哦，好吧。所以我觉得没有一个完美的词来形容。嗯，怎么舒服怎么来。不过，你知道吗？我突然想到一个很有意思的词。比如，伴侣、另一半这些词，在指代伴侣的性别方面就比较模糊。
[00:11:56.050] But whenever people say fiance, don't you just automatically kind of assume like a heterosexual relationship? That is true. I do. Very interesting because fiance sounds the same for both genders. Oh, shit. Crystal's on to something. I do think there is like a sort of benefit to the vagueness, though, of partner SO.
[00:11:56.050] 但每当人们说“未婚夫/妻”的时候，你是不是都会下意识地想到异性恋关系？确实如此。我就是这样。很有意思，因为“未婚夫/妻”这个词对男女听起来都一样。哦，天哪。Crystal 说得有道理。不过，我觉得“伴侣/另一半”这种模糊的说法也有它的好处。
[00:12:21.350] I guess even sort of fiance because for boyfriend and girlfriend and wife and husband, I feel like both terms age you a little bit in the sense that when you say boyfriend and girlfriend, you sound younger. And then wife and husband, to me, when someone says that, I'm always like, OK, you're like 30 plus, even though they might not be. Like, I'm just like totally assuming that. So I'm kind of dreading it. Like once me and James get married, I'm like, I'm going to say, oh, I have a husband and everyone's going to assume I'm like 35. So I don't know.
[00:12:21.350] 我觉得用“未婚夫/妻”都行，因为“男朋友”、“女朋友”、“妻子”、“丈夫”这些称呼，感觉都会让人显得老一些。说“男朋友”、“女朋友”听起来比较年轻，而说“妻子”、“丈夫”，我总觉得对方肯定三十多岁了，即使他们可能没那么老。我就是会这么想。所以我有点害怕。比如我和詹姆斯结婚后，我可能会说：“哦，我有丈夫了。”然后大家都会觉得我大概35岁。所以，我也不知道该怎么办。
[00:12:51.310] Looking for some loopholes out here. I need some ideas. You just keep calling him your partner. True, true. I don't know about you guys, but I feel like especially in Asian culture, like once you get married, the terms that you use to call someone is it gets different to like someone might call me like Jeejie or Jeejie. But then once I get married, they'll call me like Ayi. Oh, right. Which is like, boom, you you're middle aged like suddenly. Wait, that's such a good point.
[00:12:51.310] 我正在找些漏洞。我需要一些建议。你就一直叫他你的伴侣吧。没错，没错。我不知道你们怎么想，但我觉得尤其是在亚洲文化里，一旦结婚，称呼就会不一样了。比如，以前别人可能会叫我“姐”或者“姐”，但结婚后，他们就会叫我“阿姨”。哦，对。这就好比，砰！你突然就步入中年了。等等，你说的太对了。
[00:13:18.770] Actually, like just the fact that we're aging, they're not really calling us older sister anymore. It's more like, oh, do we call this person like auntie or older sister? And I can always see someone like calculating in their brain when they have like a young child. They're like, all right, what do I tell my child to call Crystal? And especially once you're married, it's like, oh, that's the label will be different. Yeah, for sure.
[00:13:18.770] 其实，就因为我们年纪大了，他们就不再叫我们姐姐了。现在更多的是，哦，我们该叫这个人阿姨还是姐姐呢？我总能看出，当家里有小孩的时候，有些人会琢磨着，比如，我该让孩子怎么称呼Crystal呢？尤其是结婚之后，就会觉得，哦，那称呼肯定不一样了。是啊，肯定的。
[00:13:46.890] We were traveling recently on the plane and we didn't get seats next to each other. To beg to get seats together. Like you can't just say, I want to sit next to my boyfriend. Like you sound, you're a child. No. So I was like, you had to say like a partner. I even honestly, I said husband because I need to know. I really need to sit next to this man.
[00:13:46.890] 我们最近坐飞机旅行，结果没能坐到一起。我们苦苦哀求才安排到一起。你不能直接说“我想坐在我男朋友旁边”，那样听起来像个孩子。不行。所以我就说，你得说“伴侣”之类的。说实话，我甚至说了“丈夫”，因为我需要知道。我真的需要坐在这个男人旁边。
[00:14:09.290] We were going to try to get upgraded in Europe by trying to say like Beyonce to pretend that he was in it. Oh my God. And we chickened out. We just got engaged, but then we chickened out. But we put on rings and shit too. Oh my God. Oh shit. You had rings at the ready? Yeah, we were, I literally brought them ready to be committed. And then I was like, let's just, we can just stick with the room that we bought.
[00:14:09.290] 我们本来打算在欧洲升级一下行程，假装碧昂丝也在里面。我的天哪。结果我们临阵退缩了。我们刚订婚，结果又退缩了。可是我们还戴上了戒指什么的。我的天哪。真是的。你们都准备好戒指了？是啊，我真的都准备好了，就等着订婚了。然后我就想，算了，我们还是住我们买的那个房间吧。
[00:14:40.610] Don't want to be disple. I love that though. That's so funny. We didn't do it. We didn't do it. I can't believe you, you even brought rings. Dude. Now I'm sad that you didn't do it. I really wish you did. We should have committed to the bit, man. We should have done it for this podcast. Damn it. They had the props ready. I know. That's smart though. Because one time me, Jisoo and some of our other girlfriends were on a trip and then we
[00:14:40.610] 不想失望。不过我喜欢这个。太搞笑了。我们没做。我们没做。真不敢相信你，你居然还带了戒指。兄弟。现在我好难过你没做。我真希望你做了。我们应该认真对待这件事的，伙计。我们应该为了这个播客做这件事的。该死。道具都准备好了。我知道。不过这很聪明。因为有一次我和Jisoo还有我们其他几个闺蜜一起旅行，然后我们
[00:15:09.650] were just like, oh yeah, this is totally Jisoo's bachelorette. And then we got like free champagne at like one of the dinner spots. And we're like, dude, this is a hella worth. Oh my gosh. We should do that more often. Yeah. Let's just fake be engaged all the time for free stuff. But then when your actual engagement happens, everyone will be like, wait, weren't you engaged for the past three years? Yeah.
[00:15:09.650] 我们当时就觉得，哦耶，这简直就是智秀的单身派对。然后我们在一家餐厅吃到免费香槟。我们就觉得，哇，这太值了。我的天哪。我们应该经常这么做。对啊。咱们就一直假装订婚，好蹭免费的东西。但等到你真的订婚的时候，大家都会说，等等，你们不是订婚三年了吗？对啊。
[00:15:37.130] I figured that doing that would give us bad karma. So I was like, dude, I don't know, man. Okay. That's fair. There's a potential. There's a potential. Maybe there's a limit. There's a threshold. Don't abuse it. Don't abuse it. With great power comes great responsibility. There you go. Shout out Spider-Man. Well, this kind of deviates a little bit from like the whole label aspect.
[00:15:37.130] 我觉得那样做会给我们带来不好的因果报应。所以我就想，老兄，我也不知道该怎么说。好吧。这很合理。这其中蕴含着潜力。这其中蕴含着潜力。或许也存在极限。存在着一个阈值。不要滥用它。不要滥用它。能力越大，责任越大。就是这样。致敬蜘蛛侠。嗯，这其实有点偏离了标签的范畴。
[00:16:02.450] But I do feel like a lot of times in society or like especially at work, there's sort of a need to explain your relationship to people sometimes. And I kind of wonder if it happens more when you're younger. I feel like people are always asking me like, oh, how'd you meet James? Or like, oh, like what's the backstory? And kind of like you guys, James and I have also been together for like over eight years now. So I feel like I'm always in a loop and I say the exact same story and the exact same sentences every time.
[00:16:02.450] 但我确实觉得，在社交场合，尤其是在工作中，很多时候都需要向别人解释自己的感情关系。我有点好奇，这种情况是不是在年轻人身上更常见。感觉别人总是问我，比如“你是怎么认识James的？”或者“你们的感情故事是怎样的？”其实，我和James也在一起八年多了。感觉自己好像陷入了一个循环，每次都重复着同样的故事和句子。
[00:16:32.450] And it's like a perfected story. So, yeah, sometimes I think about it and I'm like, damn, it's kind of weird that I have to be like, oh, this is our backstory and blah, blah, blah. But in a way, it's cool and like nice when people want to get to know you. No, I agree. Do you guys watch How I Met Your Mother? I haven't. Sorry. No. Lily Marshall, the ideal couple, they've been together forever. Whatever their origin story is down to like a choreographed dance. Oh, my God. They know how to chime in and like and it's so sweet. And like, yeah, so I get that.
[00:16:32.450] 这就像一个完美无瑕的故事。所以，是啊，有时候我会想，天哪，我得解释“哦，这是我们的背景故事”之类的，感觉有点怪怪的。但从某种程度上来说，当人们想了解你的时候，感觉也挺酷挺好的。没错，我同意。你们看过《老爸老妈的浪漫史》吗？我没看过。抱歉。没有。莉莉·马歇尔，那对完美情侣，他们好像永远都在一起。不管他们的爱情故事是什么，都像是一段精心编排的舞蹈。我的天哪。他们很会插话，而且很甜蜜。是啊，所以我能理解。
[00:17:02.750] No, I agree with that thing too. When I talk to all my patients and stuff too, I feel like I get a lot of practice in saying, depends on how comfortable I am. I have like an abridged version. I have like different links of it too. I'll have like a, we've noticed since elementary school, blah, blah, blah. Or I'll tell them like the whole thing. Like the whole thing. Anyways, it just depends on how comfortable I am with telling them my entire life story or relationship at least. Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:17:02.750] 不，我也同意这一点。我跟我的病人聊天的时候，感觉自己经常会说“这取决于我的自在程度”。我准备了一个简短版的，或者不同的版本。我会说“我们从小学就注意到……”之类的。或者我会把所有事情都告诉他们。真的，全部都告诉他们。总之，这取决于我是否愿意跟他们讲述我的完整人生经历或者至少是感情经历。嗯，你说得对。
[00:17:31.230] I'm thinking about this right now and I'm like, wow, I guess I haven't really asked my coworkers like how their relationships came to be. Is that rude of me? I hope not. I don't think it's rude. I think that's very personal. And like, if you guys, you guys are there, you guys are besties. Okay, cool.
[00:17:31.230] 我现在正在想这件事，然后我就想，哇，我好像还没问过我的同事们他们的关系是怎么建立起来的。我这样问是不是很失礼？希望不是。我觉得这不算失礼。我觉得这是很私人的事情。而且，如果你们是同事，那你们就是好朋友。好的，酷。
[00:17:54.510] I think I've asked very like generic and vague ones where it's like, if you moved here, did you guys meet here? Or like, you know, before you moved? Just like very simple ones. But I'm not like, sit down, tell me your whole relationship story. Unless they like just recently got engaged or something. Right, right. You're like, wow. That's true. A lot of my closer coworkers, they have been married. So I guess I'm like, oh, well, I guess I just missed out on the lore. I'll just pick up the pieces as you guys all talk.
[00:17:54.510] 我觉得我问的都是些很笼统、很模糊的问题，比如，如果你搬到这里，你们是在这里认识的吗？或者，你知道，在你搬来之前认识的？就是一些很简单的问题。但我不会要求他们坐下来，把你们的恋爱故事完整地讲给我听。除非他们最近刚订婚之类的。对，对。你会觉得，哇，真的吗？我很多关系比较好的同事都结婚了。所以我就想，哦，好吧，看来我错过了很多故事。我会在你们聊天的时候慢慢了解。
[00:18:24.350] Yeah. Plus, I feel like once people start to have kids, the like go-to question becomes kids. Like, oh, how old are your kids? What do they do? It's all about their kids. Very true. I actually have a question for you all that is kind of related to what we just talked about. Have you ever had a coworker explain like a new relationship to you and your coworker group, you know? I don't think I've ever experienced that.
[00:18:24.350] 是啊。而且我觉得一旦人们有了孩子，最常被问的问题就变成了孩子。比如，哦，你的孩子多大了？他们都干些什么？一切都围绕着孩子。确实如此。我其实有个问题想问问大家，跟我们刚才聊的有点关系。你们有没有遇到过同事向你们解释自己新恋情的情况？我好像从来没遇到过。
[00:18:48.490] But that is such a funny question because I feel like a lot of small talk and like chit chat kind of references people important in your life. So usually your SO. I think maybe the trick is like if you keep your conversation about your SO really vague all the time, then you can always like have new bays and new loves. But it all just morphs into like one like giga boyfriend, you know? That's crazy. Jisoo. Jisoo is crazy.
[00:18:48.490] 但这真是个有趣的问题，因为我觉得很多闲聊和随口说说的人，其实都会提到你生命中重要的人。所以通常都是你的另一半。我觉得诀窍可能在于，如果你一直对另一半的话题含糊其辞，那么你就可以不断地谈恋爱、谈新的恋情。但最终，所有的一切都会变成一个“超级男友”，你知道吗？太疯狂了。智秀，智秀真是个疯子。
[00:19:17.170] She's merging all the bays into one. Mastermind. Your coworkers are going to be like, so have you actually been together with James for eight plus years? Or like, you know, were there some fillers in there? This is like James V8. Like V9. Yeah, yeah. But like also what if you knew for sure that like a coworker was single? And then like have you ever had them like slowly introduce a partner?
[00:19:17.170] 她把所有关系都融合在一起了。真是个天才。你的同事肯定会问，你和詹姆斯真的在一起八年多了？或者，你知道，中间是不是也有一些过渡期？这就像詹姆斯的V8，V9。是啊，是啊。但是，如果你确定某个同事是单身呢？然后，你有没有遇到过他们慢慢地介绍伴侣的情况？
[00:19:45.230] As we all know, my current coworkers, I don't know anything about them. Right. But my past coworkers who I was really tight with, it was nice because we were all girls. So we were all just really open with the new people coming in and the other like the another person being phased out. So it's very transparent. First name names up front. Oh my God. Yeah, it was. We were bold. Wow. Transparent.
[00:19:45.230] 大家都知道，我现在的同事，我完全不了解。没错。但我以前那些关系特别好的同事，我们都是女生，相处得很好。所以我们对新来的同事，以及即将离开的同事都非常坦诚。一切都很透明。直接叫名字。我的天哪。是啊，我们当时很大胆。哇。真透明。
[00:20:14.310] I've always kind of wondered about this because it's like, what if there's this one coworker that you know who's like single for all that you've known? And then suddenly, just like three years later, out of the blue, they're like, oh my God, I got engaged. And you're like, wait, what? And I think that might be something that's more like possible for people around our age just because like we're getting near the kind of age range of like engagements. I agree with that too.
[00:20:14.310] 我一直很好奇这个问题，比如说，如果你认识一个同事，他一直都是单身，过了三年，突然之间，他/她毫无预兆地告诉你：“天哪，我订婚了！” 你肯定会一脸懵逼。我觉得这种情况在我们这个年龄段的人更容易发生，因为我们差不多到了订婚的年龄了。我也同意这种说法。
[00:20:41.070] I had a, on one of my clinicals, my instructor, when I started, she had a boyfriend. She didn't explicitly say they broke up, but she was talking like she was single. And then I found out through a mutual, I guess, coworker at that time that they did break up.
[00:20:41.070] 我在临床实习期间遇到一位指导老师，她刚入行的时候有男朋友。她虽然没明说他们分手了，但说话的口气听起来像是单身。后来我从一位我们共同的同事那里得知，他们确实分手了。
[00:21:01.250] And then within that same span, they got back together and got engaged very shortly after all within that like clinical setting too. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I thought she was done with that guy. I was like, but apparently not. That is pretty juicy. Yeah. And you couldn't even like ask. I just didn't want to prod because she was, well, she was my instructor.
[00:21:01.250] 然后就在那段时间里，他们又复合了，而且很快就订婚了，还是在那种临床环境下。是啊。我当时就想，哦，我还以为她跟那家伙分手了呢。我想，但显然没有。这事儿挺劲爆的。是啊。而且你根本没法问。我就是不想追问，因为她，嗯，她是我的指导老师。
[00:21:27.250] So it was, it would have been a little bit personal in my opinion. You're like, really that guy? And she's like, all right, F, F for you. Yeah. Yeah. I needed, I needed her to pass me to graduate. So, you know, I was just going to be in the background. To see the flip side of Michelle's and my coworker, I guess my boss, but also kind of my coworker. He didn't tell us anything really about his personal life, but especially relationships.
[00:21:27.250] 所以，我觉得这有点私人恩怨。你会想，真的吗？她会说，好吧，给你点个“F”（不及格）。是啊，是啊。我需要她让我通过才能毕业。所以，你知道，我本来只想在幕后观察一下。看看米歇尔和我同事的另一面，我猜他也算是我的老板，但某种程度上也是我的同事。他很少跟我们谈他的私生活，尤其是感情生活。
[00:21:54.410] And I found out through my coworkers who would like pester him about it too. I think we were like having a, an offsite or whatever, like a team or a company dinner or something. And then he invited like the significant others. And I heard like, oh, are you going to bring this girl? And then I was like, who's that? And they're like, oh, it's his girlfriend. I was like, oh, he has a girlfriend. And I, yeah, they've been dating for like a year, year and a half. And I was like, huh, I had no idea.
[00:21:54.410] 我是从同事那里知道的，他们也一直缠着他问这件事。我想当时我们好像在搞什么团建之类的，比如团队聚餐或者公司聚餐之类的。然后他邀请了各自的伴侣。我听到有人问：“哦，你要带这个女孩来吗？” 我就问：“那是谁？” 他们说：“哦，是他女朋友。” 我说：“哦，他有女朋友。” 然后我说：“是啊，他们交往一年到一年半了。” 我当时就懵了，心想：“咦，我完全不知道。”
[00:22:20.430] And then like recently they moved in together and he also didn't tell any of us until like, he was like, oh yeah, I'm moving. And then they were like, oh, okay. Do you have roommates? He just goes, oh yeah, I'm moving in with my partner. And I was like, oh, they had, we had no idea you guys were in that stage of the relationship, but that's great for you guys. Yeah. That illustrates like when I worked with all women, I knew everything about their personal lives and the men they were dating and their names.
[00:22:20.430] 然后，就像最近他们搬到一起住了，他也没告诉我们任何人，直到他突然说：“哦，对，我要搬家了。”然后他们就问：“哦，好的。你有室友吗？”他就说：“哦，是的，我要和我的伴侣一起住。”我当时就想，哦，原来如此，我们完全不知道你们的关系已经发展到这个阶段了，不过这对你们来说很棒。是啊。这说明，当我跟所有女性同事一起工作时，我对她们的私生活、她们的约会对象以及他们的名字都了如指掌。
[00:22:45.190] And then Eric, his boss is just dudes, just no personal conversation at all between the two. Dude. It's like that meme where your guy friend or boyfriend or whatever comes back and they're like, oh my God, like I just heard this piece of gossip. And then you're like, you ask a follow-up question and they're like, oh, I don't know. You're like, why didn't you follow up? I know. Oh my God. You're triggering Michelle. Yeah. Yeah. You're triggering me.
[00:22:45.190] 然后埃里克，他老板，就跟哥们儿似的，两人之间完全没有私人交流。哥们儿。就像那个梗图里，你的男性朋友、男朋友什么的回来，然后说，我的天哪，我刚听到个八卦。然后你追问，他们就说，哦，我不知道。你就问，你怎么不追问？我知道了。我的天哪。你惹到米歇尔生气了。是啊。是啊。你惹到我生气了。
[00:23:14.710] Cause I'm like, this always happens. Eric's catching up with his guy friends. There's some juicy stuff. I'm like, did you talk to them about it? He's like, didn't come up. I'm like, that is, that is not like, how did that not come up? You're like, that's not how you socialize. Yeah. I'm like, what do you talk about? Dude, sports, man. Yeah. Loose sports. Jeez. Guys just speak on like a need to know basis.
[00:23:14.710] 因为我就想，这种事总是发生。埃里克跟他哥们儿聚会，聊了些劲爆的八卦。我就问他，你跟他们聊过这事儿吗？他说，没聊到。我就想，这怎么可能没聊到？他说，你们社交的时候不聊这个。是啊。我就想，那你们都聊些什么？哥们儿，聊体育，兄弟。对，随便聊聊体育。哎。哥们儿之间就只聊需要知道的事儿。
[00:23:41.730] If you don't need to know, unless you explicitly ask, it's not, it's not important. It's not going to come up. I'm pretty sure there's been at least like one or two coworkers in the past where I found out later that they were married. And I was like, oh my God, like I literally had no idea because they just like kept it very private in the workplace. That's like so crazy to me because like Michelle, my current company is probably like 80% women. Right.
[00:23:41.730] 如果你不需要知道，除非你主动问起，否则这件事并不重要，也不会有人提起。我敢肯定，过去至少有一两个同事，我后来才知道他们结婚了。我当时就想，我的天哪，我竟然完全不知道，因为他们在工作场所一直把这事保密得很好。这让我觉得很不可思议，因为像米歇尔，我现在的公司大概有80%的员工都是女性。没错。
[00:24:09.610] When new people come in, we'll like kind of rotate through teams in our like bi-weekly all hands company meeting. Each team will do like a little slide like on themselves. So like I would present like, oh, like a Jisoo slide. And like, here's all this stuff about my life. And everyone who has like a partner or like is married will always put a little like kind of like a family photo and be like, I have two kids. Their names are this and this. A lot of people come on. They're like, oh, me and my wife are high school sweethearts and things like that.
[00:24:09.610] 当有新人加入时，我们会在每两周一次的全员大会上轮流介绍各个团队。每个团队都会做一个关于自己的幻灯片。比如，我会做一个关于Jisoo的幻灯片，介绍我的生活。所有有伴侣或已婚的人都会放一张全家福，比如“我有两个孩子，他们的名字是这个和这个”。很多人会说：“我和我妻子是高中时的恋人”之类的。
[00:24:38.550] You know, it's like people I've never met. Like I've never even seen them in the office yet. And I'm like, oh yeah, you know, that guy, two kids, like one wife, whatever, whatever, like three dogs. One wife. I just know. Two kids. Two kids, one wife. There's just something about like something weird to me about how a relationship is something so personal. And like love is very like personal and like sacred and like private.
[00:24:38.550] 你知道，就像那些我从未见过的人。我甚至都没在办公室见过他们。然后我就想，哦，对，你知道，就是那个人，两个孩子，一个老婆，什么的，三条狗什么的。一个老婆。我就是知道。两个孩子。两个孩子，一个老婆。对我来说，人际关系如此私密，这感觉很奇怪。爱情是如此私密、神圣、隐秘。
[00:25:06.170] But there's a really like external aspect about it, too, where you have to like come up with a good label and like a good story. And honestly, I feel like it could affect like your reputation in the workplace, depending on what your love life looks like, even though that's not really fair and doesn't have anything to do with like your professional life. So I feel like it is kind of a weird balance to have something so personal, be very open and like subject to judgment sometimes.
[00:25:06.170] 但这件事也确实存在一些外在因素，比如你得给它贴个标签，编个好故事。说实话，我觉得这可能会影响你在职场上的声誉，这取决于你的感情生活，虽然这不太公平，也跟你的职业生涯没什么关系。所以我觉得，要处理这么私人的事情，既要非常坦诚，又要承受外界的评判，这本身就是一种很微妙的平衡。
[00:25:34.830] Yeah, that's unfortunately the reality. I have friends who have met their significant others at like a rave and that's fine. Right. But like, do you want to tell your coworkers that? Oh, yeah. You're like, we met at a concert. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. Just like you got to modify the story or like certain details just to make sure it's work appropriate or just like public friendly because some of the finer details, it's like, oh, well, I would only share this with my really close friends anyway.
[00:25:34.830] 是啊，很不幸，这就是现实。我有些朋友在锐舞派对上认识了另一半，这没什么不好。没错。但是，你想跟同事说吗？哦，当然想。你会说，我们是在演唱会上认识的。对，对，你说得对。就像你得修改一下故事或者某些细节，确保它适合工作场合或者适合公开场合，因为有些细节，嗯，反正我只会跟非常亲密的朋友分享。
[00:26:04.650] I have a question for you two, Michelle and Eric. Now that you've legalized your relationship, do you call yourselves anything different to the outside world? Before we legalized it, I would say boyfriend a lot more often. Now I'm just like partner, you know, like I say it a lot more. Dude, I honestly flip. I wouldn't say that it has changed all that much. I think I try to talk at the level of the people I'm talking with.
[00:26:04.650] 米歇尔和埃里克，我有个问题想问问你们俩。既然你们已经合法化了恋爱关系，你们在对外人说话的称呼有什么变化吗？在我们合法化之前，我经常说“男朋友”。现在我就叫“伴侣”，你知道，我这么说的次数更多了。老兄，说实话，我都有点儿反反复复了。我觉得变化其实不大。我想我会尽量用对方能理解的方式和他们交流。
[00:26:34.130] So if it's like a younger person, I will say girlfriend. But if it's like a older person, I'll say partner. Or if someone also says partner, I like they have a partner. I will also say that back. Right. So you just match their energy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be honest, guys. You guys, nothing has changed. It's the same. Even though, you know, as the relationship matures, we mature with it. But so maybe that's why we say it's a how I met your mother reference. Okay.
[00:26:34.130] 所以如果对方比较年轻，我会说“女朋友”。但如果对方比较年长，我会说“伴侣”。或者如果有人也说“伴侣”，说明他们有伴侣，我也会这么回应。对。所以你只需要配合他们的语气就行了。嗯。嗯。嗯。说实话，伙计们，其实什么都没变。还是一样。虽然，你知道，随着感情的成熟，我们也会一起成熟。所以也许这就是为什么我们会说这是在玩《老爸老妈的浪漫史》的梗吧。好的。
[00:27:01.130] So when you legalize your relationship, what what exactly is it like a domestic partnership? Yeah. Here, let me tell you. Okay. Yeah. Please tell us. I'll tell you the what we we can and can't do. So. So what has changed? You guys, not much has. But now we have a piece of paper that says both of our names. It's on our fridge. And it says this relationship is recognized by the secretary of state or something. Yeah. Eric's going to go read it.
[00:27:01.130] 所以，当你们把关系合法化之后，它到底跟同居伴侣关系有什么区别？嗯。来，我来解释一下。好的。好的。请详细说说。我会告诉你们我们可以做什么，不能做什么。那么，有什么变化吗？其实变化不大。但现在我们有了一张纸，上面写着我们两个人的名字。它贴在冰箱上。上面写着这段关系得到了国务卿的认可之类的。嗯。埃里克要去看看。
[00:27:30.430] We're going to go on a field trip to the kitchen and see what that piece of paper says. But anyways, we have a piece of paper. Here we go. I know the podcast can't see it. Ooh. State of California, secretary of state, certificate of registered domestic partnership. Oh, domestic partnership. Yeah. Shirley Weber, secretary of state of California, certifies that Michelle and Eric were united in domestic partnership on 24th of January. Wow.
[00:27:30.430] 我们要去厨房“实地考察”一下，看看那张纸上写了什么。总之，我们找到了一张纸。找到了。我知道播客看不到。哦。加利福尼亚州，州务卿，注册同性伴侣关系证明。哦，同性伴侣关系。是的。加利福尼亚州州务卿雪莉·韦伯证明米歇尔和埃里克于1月24日缔结同性伴侣关系。哇。
[00:27:57.950] So the only difference is that Shirley Weber knows who we are. Probably. Thanks, Shirley. Yeah. But like now health insurance, we can get on each other's health insurance. That's a big one. If I go to prison, Eric can visit me. Oh, my God. Nice. That's huge. And if I'm hospitalized, Eric can also visit me. That's a big one. Yeah. If I pass away, Eric can get bereavement leave for me.
[00:27:57.950] 所以唯一的区别就是雪莉·韦伯知道我们是谁。大概吧。谢谢你，雪莉。是啊。不过现在我们可以互相加入对方的医疗保险了。这很重要。如果我进监狱，埃里克可以来看我。我的天哪。太好了。这意义重大。如果我住院了，埃里克也可以来看我。这也很重要。是啊。如果我去世了，埃里克可以为我申请丧假。
[00:28:26.890] Wait, you can't if you're not in a legal partnership, you can't get bereavement leave for that? I guess it depends on your company, like how strict they are. Legally, we can now. We can legally be sad. Yeah. Yeah. And I think we can adopt kids, right? Wow. We can adopt. That's so cool. Whoa. It's a serious relationship. Yeah.
[00:28:26.890] 等等，如果不是合法的伴侣关系，就不能休丧假吗？我想这取决于公司的规定，比如他们有多严格。从法律上讲，我们现在可以了。我们可以合法地悲伤了。是啊。是啊。而且我想我们还可以领养孩子，对吧？哇。我们可以领养了。太棒了。哇哦。这是一段认真的关系。是啊。
[00:28:54.070] But there's no social security benefits, so we can't file taxes together. And I think that's it. Honestly, that's probably pretty good that you're still able to file taxes separately. I think at our age, sometimes it's better that way. Yeah, I agree. We mostly did it for the insurance. It didn't really work out.
[00:28:54.070] 但是我们没有社保福利，所以不能一起报税。我想就是这样了。说实话，你们还能分开报税可能挺好的。我觉得我们这个年纪，有时候分开报税更好。是啊，我同意。我们当初主要是为了保险。结果并不理想。
[00:29:16.790] Because for just so, I guess for you to know Jisoo as well, if you try to get on James Insurance or vice versa, there's a 30-day limit with the qualifying life event. So you have to change your insurance. I guess with any insurance company, you have to change your status or qualifying life event within 30 days in order to either get the money or insurance or go on to their insurance. And if you don't, you have to wait until the next cycling period. Yes. Wow.
[00:29:16.790] 因为这样一来，我想你也应该了解一下Jisoo的情况，如果你想加入James Insurance，或者反过来，都要注意，符合条件的重大生活事件必须在30天内发生。所以你必须更换保险公司。我想任何保险公司都一样，你必须在30天内更改你的身份或符合条件的重大生活事件，才能获得赔偿或保险，或者加入他们的保险。如果你不这样做，就只能等到下一个周期了。是的。哇。
[00:29:46.590] So you know how we learned that? It's because we missed the period. And the whole point of entering a domestic partnership in the first place, we didn't even – I can't even get on Eric's insurance until the next period. So let's learn. It's almost – wait, is it November or October that the enrollment period is – Something like that. We're getting there. We're almost there. Yeah. So the whole point of it, it didn't even work out.
[00:29:46.590] 你知道我们是怎么知道的吗？因为我们错过了那个时期。我们当初决定同居伴侣关系，结果却——我甚至要等到下一个时期才能加入埃里克的保险。所以我们得赶紧搞清楚。差不多——等等，登记期是10月还是11月？——差不多吧。我们快到了。我们快到了。是啊。所以，我们当初决定同居伴侣关系，结果根本没成功。
[00:30:14.230] But hey, if I die, Eric can bereave me. Nice. Love that. Kind of off topic, but like the bereavement leave policies in like the employee handbooks are always so awkward. Like I read it sometimes and it's like, okay, parents X days, wife X days, uncles one – you know, it's like listed out by like a line item almost. And I'm like, oh my God, like this is how much I can get for like each family member.
[00:30:14.230] 不过，如果我死了，埃里克可以帮我办理丧事。真好。我喜欢这样。有点跑题了，不过员工手册里的丧假规定总是很尴尬。我有时候看的时候，上面写着，父母X天，妻子X天，叔叔1天——你知道，几乎是逐条列出的。然后我就想，我的天哪，我每个家庭成员只能休这么多假啊。
[00:30:43.610] It's so like weird to read. They calculate. They quantified every family member. Who gets the top score? Who gets the top score? I think it's your partner or your parents. Yeah. Okay. Really weird to like quantify your closeness with like each family member. Like what if your uncle was like your dad and you only had one day? That would suck. Yeah. It's fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It really is.
[00:30:43.610] 读起来真奇怪。他们居然把每个家庭成员的亲密程度都量化了。谁得分最高？谁得分最高？我觉得可能是你的伴侣或者你的父母。是啊。好吧。把和每个家庭成员的亲密程度量化，真的太奇怪了。比如说，如果你的叔叔就像你的父亲一样，而你和他只有一天的时间呢？那也太糟糕了。是啊。太扯了。是啊。是啊。是啊。确实如此。
[00:31:12.550] Just imagine reading the book and being like, oh, fuck. Wow. James died. I get 10 days old. Oh, no. Jesus is like, better not die soon, James. Okay. So now I know that you guys signed for a domestic partnership because I've also heard there's like a civil union or something. They're the same thing. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, interesting.
[00:31:12.550] 想象一下你读到那本书，然后心想：哦，天哪。哇。詹姆斯死了。我才出生十天。哦，不。耶稣说：詹姆斯，你最好别这么快就死。好吧。所以现在我知道你们俩签的是同居伴侣关系，因为我还听说还有民事结合之类的。它们是一样的。哦，对，对。哦，有意思。
[00:31:39.890] So it's the process is what did we do, Eric? We I got a form. Yeah. We had to sign up basically sign this form. The most annoying thing was getting it notarized. But fortunately, Michelle's mom has a friend who's a notary who did it for free. Yeah. I have connects, you know. And then after that, he just had to like, he did a bunch of stuff. And he was basically like, sign here, sign here. Signed it. And then we nailed it. Got a thumbprint. Yep. Thumbprints. And then we mailed it in. Okay, wait.
[00:31:39.890] 所以流程是这样的，我们做了什么，埃里克？我拿到了一张表格。对。我们得注册，基本上就是签这个表格。最麻烦的是公证。不过幸运的是，米歇尔的妈妈有个朋友是公证员，免费帮我们办了。是啊。我有人脉，你知道的。然后，他就得做很多事。他基本上就是，这里签个名，那里签个名。签完之后，我们就搞定了。按了指纹。对，按了指纹。然后我们就把表格寄出去了。好的，等等。
[00:32:09.950] So what does a notarizer do? A notarizer? Just as like there to be like, this is legit. Okay. They were given power by the state to be like, is this legit? And they're like, this is legit. And then once they sign it, it's like the state is like, whoa. That's what they do. That's my understanding, at least. Okay. Yeah. I can't speak anymore to that.
[00:32:09.950] 那么，公证员是做什么的呢？公证员？就像是证明文件合法一样。好吧。他们被州政府赋予了权力，可以判断文件是否合法。然后他们会说，这合法。一旦他们签字，州政府就会觉得，哇哦。这就是他们的工作。至少我是这么理解的。好吧。是的。关于这一点，我不能再多说了。
[00:32:38.770] I will say, though, for the domestic partnership, before we did it, I always wanted to make sure that like you can still get married afterwards. Oh, right. And you can. You can also break this off. Yes. So we can separate. Yeah. But it's not like as messy. We can't marry other people. Yes. Oh, you can't marry other people? No. Oh, right. Because you're legally bound. Yeah. Wow. One wife only for me. Yeah. Oh, okay.
[00:32:38.770] 不过，关于同居关系，在登记之前，我一直想确认一下，这样以后还能再结婚吗？哦，对。可以。也可以解除同居关系。是的。所以我们可以分开。嗯。但不会那么麻烦。我们不能和其他人结婚。是的。哦，你们不能和其他人结婚？不能。哦，对。因为你们受法律约束。是的。哇。我只能娶一个妻子。是的。哦，好的。
[00:33:08.450] I guess that is like an important distinguisher as well. This is your legal partnership. Like nothing else is recognized. Yeah. Shirley's watching. Okay, dude. Imagine though, like you broke off your domestic partnership, but like you were still dating. That would really complicate things for the state, wouldn't it? Shirley's in shambles. Thank you. God, Michelle and Eric, no. No.
[00:33:08.450] 我想这也是个重要的区别点。这是你们的法律伴侣关系。其他任何关系都不被承认。是啊。雪莉在看着呢。好吧，伙计。想象一下，你们解除了同居伴侣关系，但你们还在约会。那对州政府来说可就麻烦了，不是吗？雪莉都崩溃了。谢谢。天哪，米歇尔和埃里克，不。不。
[00:33:39.030] She's like, what's going on with this relationship? It's like, it's only been six months. God, if Shirley ever hears this, she's going to be so proud, dude. So once you get married, does the like domestic partnership just resolve by itself? It just upgrades into a marriage. Yeah, right. I think that's, I think that's what happens. Like to be honest, I'm not a hundred percent sure. Like it like overrides? Yeah.
[00:33:39.030] 她就问，这段关系到底是怎么回事？才六个月而已。天哪，如果雪莉听到这话，她肯定会很骄傲的。所以一旦结婚，同居关系就自动结束了吗？直接升级成婚姻关系？对，没错。我觉得应该是这样。不过说实话，我也不敢百分百确定。就像婚姻关系凌驾于同居关系之上一样？是的。
[00:34:07.790] Let's say that that's what happens. Yeah. Dude, maybe your paperwork will be easier because it's like, oh yeah, we're already legally bound. Now we just signed to be like, yep, we leveled up. Yeah. I like that. I like the leveling up. I know you guys said that it wasn't that big of a change for you guys, but it's still something like legal and somewhat ceremonial, I guess. Like having a notary there, he's kind of like your officiant. So did you guys like celebrate your legalization after you mailed off the papers and got the little document?
[00:34:07.790] 假设事情真是这样。是啊，哥们儿，也许你的手续会更简单，因为感觉就像，哦对了，我们已经有法律约束了。现在我们只是签了个字，就好像，没错，我们升级了。是啊，我喜欢这种感觉。我喜欢这种升级的感觉。我知道你们说这对你们来说不算什么大改变，但它仍然具有法律效力，也带点仪式感，我想。就像有公证员在场，他有点像你们的证婚人。所以，你们寄出文件并收到那份小文件后，有没有庆祝一下你们的合法化呢？
[00:34:36.930] Dude, literally no. Like literally nothing. Eric, right? We didn't. Everyone said we should have like a partnership party or a formation. Yeah. Yeah. Like what I texted people being like, yay, we got this sheet and people were like, congratulations. And I was like, thanks. Like I really, I did this for the health insurance and then we fucked up anyway. So it really like. Yeah.
[00:34:36.930] 兄弟，真的没有。真的什么都没有。埃里克，对吧？我们没办。大家都说我们应该搞个合伙庆祝会或者成立仪式什么的。对啊。对啊。我当时发短信跟人说，耶，我们拿到这份表格了，然后大家就说，恭喜。我就说，谢谢。我做这个就是为了医疗保险，结果我们还是搞砸了。所以真的……是啊。
[00:35:04.730] You guys didn't even like get a nice dinner together to celebrate all your hard work? Dude, literally no. No, it's, I'm just using Eric's. I was just, I was in it for the health insurance. Oh my God. I'm imagining Eric being like, let's go celebrate Michelle. You're like, no, we're good. No. That's why I'm so quiet right now. He's still recovering from the rejection. Dude, Eric, please. I heard us rushing back.
[00:35:04.730] 你们连一起吃顿像样的晚餐庆祝一下你们的努力都没做吗？兄弟，真的没有。不，我只是借用了埃里克的。我当时只是为了医疗保险才加入的。我的天哪。我都能想象到埃里克说：“咱们去庆祝一下米歇尔吧。” 你会说：“不用了，我们挺好的。” 不行。这就是我现在这么沉默的原因。他还在为被拒绝而难过。兄弟，埃里克，拜托。我都听到我们急匆匆地回去了。
[00:35:33.990] Oh man. Oh, that's stupid. No, we didn't celebrate much. I don't think I've, you see, again, circling back to it. I didn't tell my, anybody at work that I did this. I guess people at work would probably be like, oh, congrats. Yeah. Like, what does that mean? Yeah. Also true. Also true. More questions. Yeah. I might've told my boss because I had to ask him about the health insurance. Oh. Yeah. But besides that, I don't think I really said much.
[00:35:33.990] 哦，天哪。哦，真蠢。不，我们没怎么庆祝。我觉得我没……你看，我又绕回那件事了。我没跟任何同事说我做了这件事。我猜同事们可能会说，哦，恭喜。是啊。然后，这是什么意思？是啊。也对。也对。还有更多问题。是啊。我可能跟老板说过，因为我得问他关于医疗保险的事。哦。是啊。但除此之外，我觉得我没说什么。
[00:36:03.110] And as we know, my boss doesn't say much. Yeah. He's a good person to tell. True. I think I like told our parents. We're like, it went through and they're like sick. And like, and then. Ooh, were your parents like awesome? So when are you getting married? Yeah. My parents were definitely like, wait, why don't you guys just get married? I'm like, do you? My parents also said that. Yeah. Because they didn't know what it meant either. They didn't. Right. Right. This is so easy.
[00:36:03.110] 而且我们都知道，我老板话不多。是啊。他是个可以倾诉的人。没错。我觉得我跟父母说了。我们当时就说，事情进展顺利，他们简直要疯了。然后，就像，哦，你父母是不是觉得很棒？那你们什么时候结婚？是啊。我父母肯定说，等等，你们为什么不结婚呢？我说，你们真的要结婚吗？我父母也这么说。是啊。因为他们也不知道这意味着什么。他们不知道。对。对。这太简单了。
[00:36:31.630] I get a piece of paper and then. No wedding reception. Yeah. No like huge money drops for a giant wedding or anything. I think it cost me like $33. Amazing. Wow. And I had to mail as a check to Shirley. Wait, pause for a sec. So Shirley actually collected money from you because you guys are in a relationship? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, Shirley must be making bank. Yeah.
[00:36:31.630] 我拿到一张纸，然后……没有婚礼招待会。是啊。没有那种为了办盛大婚礼而挥金如土的场面。我记得好像只花了33美元。太不可思议了。哇。而且我还得把支票寄给雪莉。等等，停一下。所以雪莉因为你们是情侣关系就收了你的钱？是啊。是啊。是啊。老兄，雪莉肯定赚翻了。是啊。
[00:37:01.750] If everyone is just sending her $33. Dang. Jisoo's ready to be wed. Jisoo's like, I'm there. I don't know. Me, I'm just like, dude, I need to get my shit together before. Or I don't know. There's just something about partner to husband, wife. I don't know. There's, it's just, you know what? I don't even think it's the label. I think it's just like the expectation to have a big wedding. I want to have my shit together first. Yeah. I think that's fair. You got to feel ready for it.
[00:37:01.750] 如果每个人都只给她寄33美元，那可就糟了。Jisoo都准备好结婚了。Jisoo说，我随时都准备好了。我不知道。我呢，我就想，兄弟，我得先把自己的事情安排好。或者我也不知道。伴侣变成丈夫、妻子之间就是有种特别的感觉。我不知道。你知道吗？我觉得这甚至跟婚姻的标签无关。我觉得只是大家期待举办一场盛大的婚礼。我想先把自己的事情安排好。是啊。我觉得这很合理。你得觉得自己准备好了才行。
[00:37:30.470] Like partner wise, me and Eric. Cool. We're good. Right, bud? But. I'm so sorry. Yeah. There's just other things in my life. Like I feel, I guess like mainly career wise that I need to like get together first before I'm ready to spend the money and like the time planning. Yeah. That makes sense. I get that. And I think also it's like a certain ladder you're climbing in terms of like, okay, first
[00:37:30.470] 就伴侣关系而言，我和埃里克。挺好的。我们关系不错。对吧，兄弟？但是，我很抱歉。是啊。我生活中还有其他事情。我觉得，主要是事业方面，我需要先理顺一些事情，才能准备好花钱花时间去规划。嗯，有道理。我明白。而且我觉得这就像是在攀登一个阶梯，好吧，首先
[00:37:58.970] you get engaged and then married and then you have kids and it's like each step of the ladder, the pressures grow and like the expectations grow. So I totally know what you mean. Yeah. That's a, that's a good way of putting it to where it's like, especially since we've been together for so long too, it's like, I feel like people are expecting it. And also, you know, like you said, Crystal, like kind of in your late twenties and we're kind of entering that stage. So again, our decision to do this first was mostly just because I think both of us weren't
[00:37:58.970] 你订婚，然后结婚，然后生孩子，就像每走一步，压力和期望都会增加。所以我完全明白你的意思。是啊，这么说很贴切，尤其我们在一起这么久了，感觉大家都在期待着我们结婚生子。而且，就像你说的，克丽丝塔尔，我们都快三十岁了，也差不多到了这个阶段。所以，我们决定先生孩子，主要是因为我们俩都还没准备好。
[00:38:27.490] like we're committed to each other, but we're not like mentally ready to have that step yet. And we're just weren't quite ready. And so here we are in this compromise or middle ground, if you will. But again, most of this talk really started because of the health insurance, like 100%. Like that was it. I mean, I feel like that makes total sense. And like a lot of people at our age who aren't trying to get married yet, they're just like, yeah, like it's not time yet.
[00:38:27.490] 感觉我们彼此都挺喜欢对方，但心理上还没准备好迈出那一步。我们还没完全准备好。所以我们现在处于这种妥协或中间状态。不过话说回来，我们之所以开始谈论这件事，完全是因为医疗保险，百分之百。就是这样。我觉得这完全说得通。很多我们这个年纪还没打算结婚的人，都会觉得，嗯，时机未到。
[00:38:54.390] Like I'm not ready because certain other things need to get wrapped up first or whatever for you to, you're basically in the same boat, except you're like, okay, let's get health insurance together though. Right? Yeah. That's our step. That's yeah. That's in the ladder first. Do you guys ever get pressure to get married on paper first? And the reason why I ask is James and I moved in together right after college. So we were probably like 22, 23.
[00:38:54.390] 就像我还没准备好，因为有些其他事情需要先处理好之类的，你也差不多，只不过你会说，好吧，我们先一起买医疗保险吧。对吧？是的。这是我们的第一步。没错。这是第一步。你们有没有感受到过先结婚的压力？我这么问是因为我和詹姆斯大学毕业后就同居了。那时候我们大概22、23岁。
[00:39:23.430] We had also looked into a domestic partnership at the time because his company insurance was really cheap and mine was like at the time, very, very expensive. So I was like, maybe if we're domestic partners, I could just be on his health insurance, you know, as a partner or whatever and get cheaper health insurance. I had like a coworker at the time who was like campaigning for us to do it because she was in a domestic partnership. She was like, yo, this shit rocks. I'm on like two insurances now. I'm sick. Like I'm like fully covered. And I was like, oh shit.
[00:39:23.430] 当时我们也考虑过同居伴侣关系，因为他公司的保险很便宜，而我的保险当时却非常非常贵。所以我就想，如果我们是同居伴侣，我或许可以加入他的医疗保险，你知道，以伴侣的身份，这样就能享受更便宜的保险。我当时有个同事一直在劝我们这么做，因为她自己就是同居伴侣。她说：“哇，这太棒了！我现在有两份保险，我生病了，但几乎全额报销。” 我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:39:52.170] And we didn't end up doing it because it was more expensive for me to be on his plan for some reason. But I had floated this idea to my mom and I was like, I want to save money on insurance and we're like been together for a good chunk anyway. So what does it really matter? And she was like, yeah, I guess it doesn't really matter. Maybe you guys should just get married on paper first. And I was like, oh my God. But it's like a little early, but I feel like she wanted us to like sign up for it and like legalize it first. So I'm just curious if you guys had similar things from your parents.
[00:39:52.170] 最后我们没这么做，因为不知道为什么，我加入他的保险计划反而更贵。但我之前跟我妈提过这个想法，我说我想省点保险费，而且我们在一起也挺久了，所以这真的重要吗？她说，是啊，好像也没什么关系。也许你们应该先登记结婚。我当时就想，我的天哪。虽然现在有点早，但我感觉她其实是想让我们先登记结婚，让关系合法化。所以我就想问问你们有没有遇到过类似的情况。
[00:40:22.290] Eric, what do you think? Like my parents were two were just like, just get married. And then you, cause I'm always like, oh, money, money's a big thing. They're like, just have a party later. He he like, it's easy. Like, yeah, I agree. I think, uh, I think both of our parents, my parents definitely were said something along the lines of that too. I think once we explained to them how a domestic partnership works, they were a little bit more on board with it too. Dude, they're probably brainwashing themselves. Like, okay, they're basically just married.
[00:40:22.290] 埃里克，你怎么看？我爸妈当时就觉得，结婚吧。然后，因为我总是说，哎呀，钱，钱很重要。他们就说，晚点儿办个派对就行了。哈哈，好像很简单似的。嗯，我同意。我觉得，呃，我觉得我们俩的父母，我爸妈肯定也说过类似的话。我觉得我们跟他们解释了同居关系是怎么回事之后，他们也更容易接受了。哥们儿，他们可能是在自我洗脑吧。就像，好吧，他们基本上就跟结婚了一样。
[00:40:53.250] Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Oh, Jesus. I didn't know you, you had a domestic partnership too. So, you know, you know, the drill like with the notary. No, she almost did. Yeah. We like almost did it. Um, but we didn't end up doing it last minute, but I did have like a similar thought to what you were saying. I think Michelle of like, I was like, I feel like my parents don't know what this is. And maybe it's cause Korea has like good health insurance for everyone. So there's no need for this, you know, kind of like midpoint, I guess, between marriage
[00:40:53.250] 是啊。也许吧。也许吧。哦，天哪。我不知道你也有同居伴侣关系。所以，你知道，你知道，就像找公证人那样。不，她差点就办了。是啊。我们差点就办了。嗯，但我们最后没办成，不过我的想法跟你说的差不多。我觉得米歇尔，我当时就想，我觉得我父母不知道这是什么。也许是因为韩国人人都有很好的医疗保险。所以没必要办这个，你知道，有点像婚姻之间的过渡阶段。
[00:41:22.710] and like single because everyone can just go to the pharmacy and get things for like $10 instead of like $800. I think the whole domestic partnership civil union was when same-sex couples, when same-sex marriage wasn't allowed, this was like the workaround. Yeah. Also for them to have kids. Was that right too, Michelle? For them to like adopt kids and stuff. All right.
[00:41:22.710] 而且单身人士也喜欢单身，因为每个人都可以去药店花10美元左右买到东西，而不是花800美元。我觉得同性伴侣民事结合制度是在同性婚姻不合法的时候，作为一种变通办法。是的。也是为了让他们能生孩子。米歇尔，你说的对吗？比如领养孩子什么的。好的。
[00:41:51.050] Well, I think that was a very fascinating discussion and very surprising to know that Jisoo, you also thought about it, but ultimately it makes a lot of sense. Um, I think especially for, we keep saying this, but like people are age kind of entering the engagement age range, but you know, some people aren't ready for it, but like you're already so committed that it's like, well, why can't we just get some of the benefits of being in like a super committed relationship when you know in the future, like a marriage
[00:41:51.050] 嗯，我觉得那真是一场非常有趣的讨论，而且很惊讶Jisoo你也考虑过这个问题，但最终想想也很有道理。嗯，我觉得尤其像我们一直说的，人们到了差不多该订婚的年纪，但你知道，有些人还没准备好，但你已经非常投入了，所以就会想，为什么我们不能在确定未来结婚之前，就享受到一段高度投入的恋爱关系带来的种种好处呢？
[00:42:19.930] is probably in sight. It's nice to know that there's options to like look out for that could be useful for you and your, for anyone in their long-term relationships.
