[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Lindsay.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Lindsay。
[00:00:17.100] Today we have a very exciting guest. Her name is Lindsay and she has very, very, I would say to us, much more of a unique background. And we have a fun episode planned ahead. So Lindsay, how about you tell our listeners a little bit about yourself?
[00:00:17.100] 今天我们请到了一位非常令人兴奋的嘉宾。她叫琳赛，她的背景非常非常独特，可以说是非常特别。我们为大家准备了一期精彩的节目。琳赛，不如你先跟我们的听众简单介绍一下自己吧？
[00:00:33.580] Yes, I'm so excited to be here and honored to be unique in any capacity. I'm Lindsay. I am Asian American. I'm 29 years old. And I guess first and foremost, I'm a writer in Hollywood. So that's technically my vocation. But maybe what you're referring to in terms of the uniqueness is that it's led me down this road of really evaluating my ambition and my dreams and self-love and a lot of the things that I've had to make a part of my life in order to keep this dream and this occupation.
[00:00:33.580] 是的，我非常激动能来到这里，也为自己的独特性感到荣幸。我叫琳赛，亚裔美国人，今年29岁。首先，我是一名好莱坞的编剧，这算是我的职业。但也许你所说的独特之处在于，它引领我走上了一条重新审视我的抱负、梦想、自我关爱以及为了实现梦想和这份职业而不得不融入我生活的诸多方面的道路。
[00:01:04.060] And we know in the Asian American experience that ambition is not a foreign experience to us. But in the arts, I think it's definitely straddling a different kind of line. And so what I would just say is from the dawn of my consciousness, I have defined myself for better and for worse by my ambition and by my massive dreams.
[00:01:04.060] 我们都知道，在亚裔美国人的经历中，雄心壮志并非陌生的体验。但在艺术领域，我认为情况截然不同。所以，我想说的是，从我记事起，我的雄心壮志和远大梦想就定义了我，无论好坏。
[00:01:23.860] And it's really been a hell of a roller coaster through the 20s, finding that balance to still be ambitious, still believe in myself, but ultimately come from a more grounded, self-loving place of knowing my own worth, which is why I also created my podcast, which is called You Founder, which I'm sure we'll talk about more as well. But so excited to be here.
[00:01:23.860] 20多岁的这段时间真是跌宕起伏，我一直在努力寻找平衡点，既要保持雄心壮志，又要相信自己，但最终要脚踏实地，更加爱自己，认识到自身的价值。这也是我创办播客节目《You Founder》的原因，我相信我们以后也会更多地聊到它。总之，很高兴来到这里。
[00:01:43.320] Awesome. And Lindsay, I think you alluded to a lot of what we'll be talking about in today's episode in your intro. All three of us are currently in our late 20s. And I feel like this is a very interesting stage in life where I definitely feel more self-assured and more confident than I was in my early 20s. But at the same time, there's a lot of things that I am still unlearning, still figuring out and really working on to try to set my next few decades of life up for success.
[00:01:43.320] 太棒了。琳赛，我觉得你在开场白里已经暗示了我们今天这期节目要聊的很多内容。我们三个现在都快三十岁了。我觉得这是人生中一个非常有趣的阶段，我感觉自己比二十出头的时候更加自信、更加自信心了。但与此同时，我还有很多东西需要学习、需要摸索，需要努力去为未来几十年的人生打下坚实的基础。
[00:02:11.980] And I think a lot of that is rooted in self-love and the antithesis of self-love, which is negative self-talk. Oh, yeah. Let's start us there and talk about identifying negative self-talk. How does this manifest for you? When do you see this pop up the most? And what does that kind of look like for you right now?
[00:02:11.980] 我觉得这很大程度上源于自爱，以及与自爱相反的负面自我对话。哦，对。我们就从这里开始，谈谈如何识别负面自我对话。它对你来说是如何表现的？你最常在什么时候看到它出现？它现在对你来说又是什么样子呢？
[00:02:31.080] Well, I would say that first and foremost, one thing to know about me and my overachieving for better and for worse journey is that really, I think the wound that I have that I know a lot of overachieving people have is you're placing your worth on exterior validation, exterior gain. And that can look so many different ways. Obviously, there's the overachievers in school, it's in your career, it can just be social media, whatever you place value in.
[00:02:31.080] 首先，我想说的是，关于我以及我这段无论好坏都力求完美的经历，有一点需要了解：我认为我和很多力求完美的人一样，都存在一个共同的痛点，那就是我们把自身的价值建立在外界的认可和回报之上。而这可以体现在很多方面。显然，有些人在学校里力求完美，有些人在事业上力求完美，有些人则在社交媒体上力求完美，总之，无论你重视什么，都可能成为你的价值所在。
[00:02:54.840] And I would say that my negative self-talk really came in the form of, and this is, I felt normalized in like AP, IB culture, hustle culture, is working yourself to the bone, but really a shame-driven sort of narrative. So like you set a metric for your success, whether it's I'm going to get into Stanford or I'm going to get this certain job at this tech company. Or in my case, it's like, I'm going to be 25 or 26 when I become a staff writer in a TV show in Hollywood. And by age 30, I'm going to hit the metric of selling my own TV show.
[00:02:54.840] 我觉得我的负面自我对话主要体现在一种文化上，比如AP、IB之类的“拼命三郎”文化，这种文化提倡拼尽全力，但实际上却是一种羞耻感驱动的叙事。你会给自己设定成功的标准，比如考上斯坦福，或者在某家科技公司找到一份特定的工作。就我而言，我的目标是25、26岁的时候成为好莱坞电视剧的编剧，30岁的时候卖掉自己的电视剧。
[00:03:24.820] And when we're overachievers and perfectionists, these metrics tend to be damn near impossible, really impressive. Like you're really pushing yourself to the limit. And what I have found in my self-talk, there's just a complete lack of self-compassion when those metrics are not hit. It can create a very shame-spiraling self-talk story that's exacerbated by social media, that's exacerbated by the general sense of comparison that so many people in their 20s feel.
[00:03:24.820] 当我们是追求完美、力求完美的人时，这些指标往往高得离谱，令人叹为观止。就好像你真的在挑战自己的极限。而我发现，当我的自我对话中，如果这些指标没有达到，就会完全缺乏自我关怀。这会引发一种深深的羞愧感，而社交媒体和许多二十多岁的人普遍存在的攀比心理又会加剧这种羞愧感。
[00:03:50.520] And just being really gnarly and judgmental about your flaws and your inadequacies, depending on what you place value on. And for me, I've noticed that my pattern was to basically set almost impossible metrics. Sometimes I would hit them. And by the way, I think what's important when we talk about negative self-talk is to acknowledge that every emotion or thing we engage with, even if it is quote unquote negative, serves us in some way, even if it's maladaptive.
[00:03:50.520] 而且，你对自身缺点和不足之处的评判会非常苛刻，这取决于你重视什么。就我而言，我发现自己总是设定几乎不可能达到的目标。有时候我能做到。顺便说一句，我认为当我们谈论消极的自我对话时，重要的是要认识到，我们所经历的每一种情绪或事物，即使是所谓的“消极”情绪，也会以某种方式对我们有所助益，即使这种助益是不适应的。
[00:04:16.660] So like just acknowledging that on some level, a lot of ambitious people have been served by kind of shaming themselves into overwork, anxious overdoing, and you have achieved things as a result. So you think that, okay, well, it's worked for me. I got into that school. I got that job. Got to keep feeding this beast. But the risk that you run, of course, is continuing to reach new metrics, new summits of success and never really feeling enough.
[00:04:16.660] 所以，我们得承认，在某种程度上，很多雄心勃勃的人都通过自我羞辱的方式过度工作、焦虑地拼命，最终取得了一些成就。于是你会想，好吧，这招对我管用。我考上了那所学校，找到了那份工作。我得继续努力。但你当然要承担这样的风险：不断攀登新的高峰，不断达到新的成功巅峰，却永远感觉不够。
[00:04:40.780] That's the pattern that I certainly encountered in my 20s of feeling like I'm on this hamster wheel of never enoughness, even though ostensibly like successes are happening in my resume. Which is why I was like, okay, the issue is obviously not external. The issue is obviously internal. Let's look at the self-talk. And once I started doing, let's say, intensive therapy and just calling upon every podcast, every book, and making that my business from my early 20s, I realized the self-talk is not pretty. And it's not for a lot of us.
[00:04:40.780] 我二十多岁的时候确实遇到过这种模式：感觉自己像在仓鼠轮上不停地转，永远都觉得不够好，即使我的履历上看起来确实取得了一些成功。所以我当时就想，好吧，问题显然不在外部，问题显然出在内部。让我们来看看我的内心对话。当我开始进行一些深入的心理治疗，并且把所有相关的播客、书籍都翻出来，从二十出头就开始把这当成我的事业时，我意识到我的内心对话并不美好。而且，我们很多人都是如此。
[00:05:09.120] We are so hard on ourselves. There are definitely a few things we can talk about in terms of revamping that self-talk, but that's what it's looked like for me. You don't hit the metric and you're like, oh, my God, you're just not good enough. You know you could have worked harder. You're a failure for not reaching that. You overestimated or underestimated the work that you had to do. And it can get really nasty. Yeah, honestly, that is such a good point, especially about the shame or the fact that we drive ourselves with a lot of negativity.
[00:05:09.120] 我们对自己太苛刻了。关于如何改善这种自我对话，我们确实可以探讨一些方法，但对我来说，情况就是这样。你没达到目标，就会想，天哪，你就是不够好。你知道自己本可以更努力。没达到目标，你就觉得自己是个失败者。你高估或低估了自己需要完成的工作量。这种情况会变得非常糟糕。是的，说真的，你说的很有道理，尤其是关于羞耻感，或者说我们常常用消极情绪来驱动自己这一点。
[00:05:36.920] It's not really supporting ourselves positively. It's like, wow, you couldn't even do that. You know, that kind of talk. It's like you're so pathetic. You couldn't even figure out how to do that. Look at everybody else who's figuring out how to do that. And you tried your hardest and it's still not enough. How embarrassing, right? It's like, who would you talk to anyone you love that way? Not in a thousand years.
[00:05:36.920] 这根本不是在积极地支持自己。就好像在说：“哇，你连这个都做不到。”你知道，就是那种语气。就好像你太可怜了。你连怎么做都搞不明白。看看其他人，他们都在努力尝试，而你明明已经尽力了，却还是不够。多尴尬啊，对吧？你敢这样跟自己爱的人说话吗？就算过了一千年也不会。
[00:05:59.740] And I honestly felt like I was reflecting a lot about, I guess, my work style in the past year or two because I was like, you know, I feel like I procrastinate a lot. And I really need to fix this issue. And I talked about it with therapists and I really took a hard look at how I was working, too. And I realized a lot of it was very similar, right? Driven by negativity or shame. Oh, you need to finish this or else you suck.
[00:05:59.740] 说实话，过去一两年我一直在反思自己的工作方式，因为我觉得自己总是拖延，真的需要解决这个问题。我和心理咨询师谈过，也认真审视了自己的工作方式。我发现很多时候都差不多，对吧？都是被消极情绪或羞耻感驱使的。比如，你必须完成这件事，否则你就太差劲了。
[00:06:24.700] Kind of you don't finish this, then like maybe you'd get fired because that's like the thing that needs to get done instead of it being like, oh, you need to finish this. And that can improve other projects or like other things at work. It's just all mostly driven by this like cycle of negativity. And then that is not encouraging. That just further drives the procrastination because then it's like, you know, once I get to finish this, it's not a prize that I'm getting. It's just a at least you don't suck. Right.
[00:06:24.700] 如果你不完成这件事，你可能就会被炒鱿鱼，因为这好像成了必须要做的事情，而不是像现在这样，觉得“哦，你需要完成这件事”。完成这件事可以促进其他项目或工作上的其他事情。这一切基本上都是由这种消极循环驱动的。而这种消极循环并不鼓舞人心，反而会加剧拖延，因为你会觉得，你知道，即使我完成了这件事，也没有什么奖励，只不过是“至少你没做得一塌糊涂”而已。对吧？
[00:06:53.580] What a horrible way to live. You know, you're just at a constant deficit and a constant place of what we know as scarcity mindset. And it's like, where is the contentment in this model? You don't ever get to have it. Exactly. It's like who would want that for themselves? But I do feel in a way this is like what the 20s have been for, at least for me, is some things you can only learn the hard way. And I feel like this is the lesson that has taken me the longest to learn. It's like five, six, seven, eight times across the 20s.
[00:06:53.580] 这种生活方式真是糟糕透了。你知道，你总是处于匮乏状态，总是被困在所谓的匮乏心态里。这种模式下，满足感从何而来？你永远也得不到满足。没错。谁会想要这样的生活呢？但我觉得，至少对我来说，20多岁就是用来学习一些东西的，有些东西只能通过痛苦的经历才能领悟。我觉得这是我花最长时间才领悟的教训。在20多岁的时候，我大概经历了五六七八次这样的教训。
[00:07:23.260] I'm like, OK, wait a second. I've been here before. Clearly, I'm not learning this lesson. It's a hard one to learn. It totally is. And I feel like sometimes for something like this, where you are so used to negative self-talk, exposure therapy has been very helpful for me, where sometimes I would see a friend maybe thinking or saying the same thing that I would tell myself. And I would be so shocked. Like, don't ever talk to yourself like that. You know, you're so beautiful and this and that.
[00:07:23.260] 我心想，好吧，等等。我以前也经历过这种情况。显然，我没吸取教训。这真的很难学会。确实很难。我觉得有时候，像这种习惯了自我否定的人，暴露疗法对我的帮助很大。有时候我会看到朋友在想或者说一些我平时对自己说的话，我会非常震惊。就像，千万别那样跟自己说话。你知道，你很漂亮，等等等等。
[00:07:51.240] And then you start to wonder, like, why am I so OK with saying and thinking these things to myself? But I would never want a friend or family member to do that to themselves. Oh, yeah. I had an experience recently where I was talking to another content creator and we have a similar following, similar kind of niche. And we were just talking about the struggles that come with doing this and posting every day and growing a following, whatever. She was like, what have you been doing to cope? And then I said, well, the truth is, do you ever just like go on other people's pages? You see how fast they're growing.
[00:07:51.240] 然后你就会开始想，为什么我能如此坦然地对自己说这些话、想这些事？但我绝不希望我的朋友或家人也这样对待自己。哦，对了。我最近就遇到过这样的事，我和另一位内容创作者聊天，我们的粉丝群体很相似，内容也属于类似的领域。我们聊到了做这行的种种挑战，比如每天发帖、努力涨粉等等。她问我，你是怎么应对的？然后我说，其实，你有没有看过别人的主页？你看他们的粉丝增长速度有多快。
[00:08:19.700] You see, are they intrinsically more talented at this or are they intrinsically better? And I just saw her beautiful, worthy face. And I was like, what? Why am I casting my poison upon her? This is like she doesn't deserve this. And I just I felt like this protection over her. Like, why would I ever expose her to these kinds of nasty, lowly thoughts that are OK for me? And then I paused myself and I was like, why is that OK for me?
[00:08:19.700] 你看，她们是天生更有天赋，还是天生更优秀？我当时就看到了她美丽善良的脸庞。然后我就想，什么？我为什么要把我的恶意加在她身上？她不应该承受这些。我当时就想保护她。我为什么要让她接触到这些对我来说可以接受的、肮脏卑劣的想法？然后我停下来想，为什么我可以接受这些想法？
[00:08:47.000] You know, I have like a natural reverence toward anybody else. But yeah, when it comes to our own sick heads or whatever, it's like there's this relentless sense of you can handle it. You need to keep beating yourself down. And if you don't insert the fear, you confront your fear of failure. You confront your fear of worthlessness, like not being lovable. That's really what lies at the bottom of everything. But if we could see ourselves with the same basic decency and love that we see our closest people, well, that would be a different world.
[00:08:47.000] 你知道，我对任何人都有一种与生俱来的敬畏之心。但是，说到我们自己的那些糟心事，或者其他什么问题，就好像有一种挥之不去的信念：你能搞定。你需要不断地自我否定。如果你不去强加恐惧，你就会直面自己对失败的恐惧，直面自己对自身价值的恐惧，比如害怕自己不被爱。这才是所有问题的根源所在。但如果我们能像看待最亲近的人那样，用同样的善意和爱来看待自己，那将会是一个截然不同的世界。
[00:09:17.440] It's crazy how we're always the first to, you know, jump up and be supportive for close friends and loved ones. And then also the first to like beat yourself down pretty much. Yeah. Something else I noticed, I recently did an episode on my podcast about self-criticism specifically. I gave like a self-criticism test and, you know, I failed that test.
[00:09:17.440] 真是奇怪，我们总是第一个站出来支持亲朋好友，然后又总是第一个自我贬低。是啊。我还注意到一点，我最近在我的播客节目里专门做了一期关于自我批评的节目。我做了一个自我批评测试，结果，你知道，我没通过。
[00:09:38.280] In this self-criticism diagnostic, one of the things is like when you fail or you perceive some kind of setback, do you kind of feel like you're alone? One. And two, that other people are doing better off than you. It's this sense of I go down, which means other people go up or vice versa. They go up, which means I go down. It's like a weird psychological thing that happens. And that's I absolutely suffer from that.
[00:09:38.280] 在这个自我批评诊断中，其中一点是，当你失败或遭遇挫折时，你是否感觉自己很孤独？第一，第二，你是否觉得别人比你过得更好？这是一种“我走下坡路，就意味着别人走上坡路，反之亦然。他们走上坡路，就意味着我走下坡路”的感觉。这是一种很奇怪的心理现象。而我本人就深受其害。
[00:10:04.500] If I'm in the midst of some kind of comparison cycle, I'm like, not only did I do poorly in this situation, but I know everyone else is doing better. They would have handled this better. It's like pushing myself further into this like abject self-pity. What is that? I don't know, in some sick way, I think it's the brain just trying to control, trying to find an answer, trying to do anything to like control the story out of this situation. It is wild. I can totally relate to that.
[00:10:04.500] 如果我陷入某种比较的怪圈，我就会想，不仅我在这件事上做得不好，而且我知道其他人都做得更好。他们肯定能处理得更好。这就像把自己推入一种极度自怜的深渊。这是怎么回事？我不知道，从某种病态的角度来看，我觉得这是大脑试图控制一切，试图找到答案，试图不惜一切代价掌控局面。这太疯狂了。我完全能理解这种感受。
[00:10:32.120] And I feel like the twisted way that I feel it sometimes too is in my moments of really big insecurities. And when I'm really not feeling good about myself, I find myself being more of a hater sometimes too. It's like a double-edged sword. I'll be a hater and also be like, oh, but still this person is so much better than me. And it's like, what am I even thinking? It's like I'm thinking the worst of every situation and I can't catch a break. Totally.
[00:10:32.120] 我觉得有时候，我这种扭曲的感受也会发生在我极度缺乏安全感的时候。当我对自己感觉很差的时候，我发现自己有时也会变得更讨厌别人。这就像一把双刃剑。我会讨厌别人，但同时又会想，哦，这个人比我好太多了。然后我就想，我到底在想什么？感觉我总是往最坏的方向想，根本没办法摆脱这种想法。真的。
[00:10:56.300] I'm so quick to just, if some unlikely situation, like if I'm at my least healthy, like let's say I hear that a friend in my 20s, I have been plenty of times insecure about, am I going to find my person? Am I going to fall in love? Like whatever, looking outside of myself for that. And then I'll hear about some friend of mine who I know is not intrinsically more evolved or like more connected with their self-love, but then they'll meet somebody.
[00:10:56.300] 我总是很容易胡思乱想，比如在一些不太可能发生的情况下，比如我状态最差的时候，比如我听说一个我二十多岁的朋友——我一直很在意她——遇到了另一半，我还能找到真爱吗？我能坠入爱河吗？诸如此类，我总是向外寻求答案。然后我又会听说，我的某个朋友，我知道她本质上并不比我成熟，也不比我更懂得爱自己，但她却遇到了另一半。
[00:11:20.540] And I will automatically assume, well, they're going to fall in love and they're going to disappear and they're going to get married next year and I'm going to be all alone. And this is clearly proof that it's all going to shit for me. It's terrible. But it's just like that's what anxiety is. You know, you're trying to play out the worst case scenario so you can like prepare yourself for it.
[00:11:20.540] 然后我就会不由自主地想，他们会坠入爱河，他们会消失，他们会在明年结婚，然后我就孤身一人了。这显然证明我的一切都糟透了。太可怕了。但焦虑就是这样。你知道，你会试图设想最糟糕的情况，这样你才能做好准备。
[00:11:40.880] But that is something now when I can feel that happening in my career or like some deadline announcement to just pause and be like, let's stop that little scurrying rodent in your head from like digging that hole deeper. Challenge your narrative. Ask yourself, can you really truly ascertain that what you're thinking is true? Do you know it's true? And what would it look like to not pass judgment on that situation and accept that the story is still unfolding?
[00:11:40.880] 但现在，每当我在职业生涯中遇到这种情况，或者面临截止日期临近时，我都会停下来，告诉自己：别让脑子里那只乱窜的小老鼠越挖越深。质疑你原有的认知。问问自己，你真的能确定你的想法是真的吗？你知道它是真的吗？如果不去评判这种情况，而是接受故事仍在发展，那会是什么样子呢？
[00:12:10.080] You do not have all the information. That's step one. And then step two is then coming from a place of self-compassion. Very challenging for those who haven't practiced it before, but it's so worthwhile. Rather than scarcity, competition, jealousy. You know what I mean? Like these are some of the choices that we all have. But sometimes we just unravel and it gets away from us.
[00:12:10.080] 你并不掌握所有信息。这是第一步。第二步是从自我关怀的角度出发。对于那些以前从未练习过的人来说，这非常具有挑战性，但绝对值得。与其纠结于匮乏、竞争和嫉妒，你明白我的意思吗？这些都是我们每个人都可能面临的选择。但有时我们会失控，事情就此失控。
[00:12:33.640] And I kind of want to make a call back to the point you brought up earlier about the self-criticism diagnostic thing where you said if other people are improving, that makes you feel like you're deproving, I guess. Or if you didn't reach something, that makes it feel like other people rose because of that. I gave it a thought and I'm like, yeah, that is actually so applicable. Even to your example of someone getting into a relationship and say you're not in a relationship, that feels like, oh, am I falling behind?
[00:12:33.640] 我想再补充一下你之前提到的自我批评诊断，你说如果别人在进步，你会觉得自己在退步。或者如果你没达到某个目标，你会觉得别人因此而进步。我仔细想了想，觉得这确实很有道理。就拿你举的例子来说，比如别人谈恋爱了，而你单身，你会觉得，哦，我是不是落后了？
[00:13:03.900] This other person is about to like get married, even though they just got into this relationship like one day ago. Yeah. Or even at work when it's like other people are switching companies or like getting new roles or like getting promoted. And it starts to feel like, oh, does that mean that I'm falling behind? So I can totally see where this narrative inserts itself into so many different parts of life. Yes. Yes. It's really we're all storytelling. We're creating a oftentimes fictional narrative based off of limited information.
[00:13:03.900] 另一个人好像要结婚了，尽管他们才交往一天。是啊。或者在工作中，当其他人跳槽、换工作或者升职的时候，你就会开始觉得，哦，那是不是意味着我落后了？所以我完全能理解这种叙事方式是如何渗透到生活的方方面面的。没错。没错。其实我们都在讲故事。我们常常基于有限的信息，创造出一个虚构的故事。
[00:13:33.580] And it's asking yourself, why are you willing to assume the absolute best case almost delusionally? So scenario for everyone else. But when it comes to you and your future, you're choosing the cruelest, most scarce scenario. What's up with that? What does that say about you?
[00:13:33.580] 这其实是在问你自己，为什么你总是近乎妄想地选择绝对最好的情况？对其他人来说都是如此，但轮到你和你的未来时，你却选择了最残酷、最渺茫的方案。这是怎么回事？这说明了你什么？
[00:13:53.000] And like when I've talked about this in my therapy, it's been that, you know, oftentimes when we're younger, right, in our formative years of childhood and adolescence, if you were taught or conditioned to see yourself as categorically other, at least that's my situation. You were bullied or at some point you internalized a story, even from one person. Maybe it was your best friend. Maybe it was your mom or your sibling. That there was something about you that wasn't a winner.
[00:13:53.000] 就像我在心理治疗中谈到的那样，你知道，很多时候，在我们年幼的时候，在童年和青少年时期，如果我们被教导或被灌输了一种观念，认为我们与常人格格不入——至少我的情况是这样。我们可能遭受过霸凌，或者在某个时候内化了一种观念，即使这种观念只来自一个人。也许是你最好的朋友，也许是你的母亲或兄弟姐妹。这种观念认为，你身上有某种缺陷，让你觉得自己不够好。
[00:14:20.620] Good things didn't come to you or that you had to fight for your worth. You had to fight for your attention. And by the way, who isn't the recipient of this story at one point in time? It's a tough culture. It's a tough world. If you internalize that, that's what leads you to this point in time potentially where you're like, good things do not come to me. I do not often get what I want. I have to fight so hard to even be seen just a speck compared to them, you know? And it's like, obviously, all we can control is the story we tell ourselves about who we are.
[00:14:20.620] 好事不会主动找上门，你也不需要为了自己的价值而奋斗。你需要努力争取关注。顺便说一句，谁没经历过这种事呢？这是一个残酷的文化，这是一个残酷的世界。如果你把这些都内化于心，就可能导致你走到今天这一步，你会觉得好事不会降临到我身上，我常常得不到自己想要的。我必须拼尽全力才能在别人眼中显得微不足道，你知道吗？很显然，我们唯一能掌控的，就是我们讲述的关于自己是谁的故事。
[00:14:47.880] As has been proven by all these kind of manifestation and psychological trials and scenarios in the world, we are what we think. It changes us. It changes what we attract. It changes the way we interface with people. It changes our relationships. Nothing could be more important. Fortunately, it's being talked about more and it's something that I certainly focus on in my content. But it's a doozy. It's so worth talking about.
[00:14:47.880] 正如世界各地各种显化现象、心理实验和情景所证明的那样，我们就是我们所想的。它改变我们，改变我们吸引的事物，改变我们与人交往的方式，改变我们的人际关系。没有什么比这更重要。幸运的是，现在越来越多的人开始谈论它，而这正是我在内容创作中重点关注的主题。但这确实是一个棘手的问题，非常值得探讨。
[00:15:10.380] I think that's interesting to me because growing up, I feel like we were raised on like a different set or like style of YouTube. And what was really in back then was hustle culture, grind culture, wake up at 5 a.m., take a cold shower, work out, blah, blah. And a lot of what was behind that was like you create your own path, you forge your own path, be an optimist, and that will cure every single problem in your life. And I think I spent a lot of my late teens and early 20s trying to unlearn that in a certain sense.
[00:15:10.380] 我觉得这很有意思，因为我成长过程中，感觉我们接触的YouTube风格和现在不太一样。那时候流行的是拼命奋斗文化，每天早上五点起床，冲个冷水澡，锻炼身体等等。这种文化背后很大程度上是说，你要自己开辟道路，要保持乐观，这样就能解决生活中所有的问题。我觉得我十几岁到二十出头的那段时间，一直在努力摆脱这种观念。
[00:15:40.180] Because yes, while I agree that optimism goes a long way, I don't necessarily think that waking up at 5 a.m. every day is like the sole solution to all your life's miseries. But for some reason in my late 20s, I'm trying to like rewarm myself back to the optimism thing, which sounds stupid, but it's true. I feel like that glass half full, glass half empty thing is no longer just a cliche and I'm starting to really feel the power of that.
[00:15:40.180] 没错，我同意乐观固然重要，但我并不认为每天早上五点起床就能解决人生所有烦恼。不过，不知为何，快三十岁的时候，我又开始努力重拾乐观，这听起来可能有点傻，但却是真的。我觉得“杯子半满”和“杯子半空”的说法不再只是老生常谈，我开始真切地感受到它的力量。
[00:16:07.300] And I even see it leaking into like the world of K-pop. Ooh, that's an essay that I would read. Something very small, but there's a Korean idol. Her name is Jang Won-young. She's considered to be like one of the top stars of the most recent idol generation. And she did an interview or something on TV where she was like, yeah, I have this like mindset. I call it lucky Vicky. Whenever anything happens to me, whether it's good or bad, I'm just like, oh, I'm so lucky.
[00:16:07.300] 我甚至看到这种心态渗透到了K-pop圈。哦，这倒是个值得一读的文章。虽然只是个很小的例子，但有个韩国偶像，名叫张元英，被认为是新一代偶像中的佼佼者。她接受电视采访时说，她有这种心态，我称之为“幸运维姬”。无论发生什么事，不管是好事还是坏事，我都会想，哦，我真是太幸运了。
[00:16:35.040] This would totally happen to me because I'm a lucky Vicky. And then that just completely changes the way she perceives anything that ever happens. And I was like, it's such a simple thing. Yeah, that is in a sense like very revolutionary to me. It's totally revolutionary. And it's also so cool that you can and maybe we should practice that when we are rejected. We have failed. And it's saying, I'm so lucky because this is a redirection or this is a protection from what I thought I wanted. And I'm actually being pulled now to what I need.
[00:16:35.040] 这事儿肯定会发生在我身上，因为我是个幸运的维姬。然后，这彻底改变了她看待一切事物的方式。我就想，这事儿就这么简单。是啊，从某种意义上说，这对我来说非常具有革命性。它完全是革命性的。而且，当我们被拒绝、失败时，我们或许也应该练习这种思维方式，这真的很棒。它告诉我们，我很幸运，因为这是一种引导，或者说是一种保护，让我免受我以为自己想要的东西的伤害。而现在，我实际上正被拉向我真正需要的东西。
[00:17:05.040] Or what will ultimately serve me more and greater in the end. We can say thank you truly for everything. And I had a Reiki healer once. Love her so much. I was talking about how things weren't going right for me. I had a list of this has gone wrong. This has gone to shit. It's not working. And she was like, okay, stop. I actually have been paying attention to this conversation. And you haven't mentioned these three, four or five things that are going really well for you. And really the attitude that we should be in is, holy shit.
[00:17:05.040] 或者说，最终什么对我更有益、更有意义。我们可以真诚地感谢一切。我曾经找过一位灵气疗愈师，我非常爱她。我当时在抱怨自己诸事不顺，列了一张清单，上面写着“这事儿出错了”、“这事儿搞砸了”、“这事儿行不通”。她听后说：“好了，停一下。我其实一直在认真听你说话。你还没提到你那三四五件进展顺利的事情呢。” 我们应该有的心态是：我的天哪！
[00:17:35.100] This is so cool. Thank you so much. Holy shit. I get to like wake up every day and do X, Y, Z. And it's the same thing as like, I'm so lucky. I'm so fortunate. And it is so small. But I don't know. I think it sounds like the most powerful thing I've heard all day. Yeah, I feel like this also reminds me of it's called like the lucky girl syndrome that was kind of going around TikTok for a while, which is very similar. But it's also kind of just reminding yourself, oh, I'm a lucky girl. Things will work out.
[00:17:35.100] 这太酷了。非常感谢。我的天哪。我每天醒来都能做这做那。这感觉就像，我太幸运了。我太有福气了。虽然这听起来微不足道，但我不知道。我觉得这是我今天听到的最有力量的话。是啊，这让我想起了之前在TikTok上很火的“幸运女孩综合症”，很相似。其实就是不断提醒自己：哦，我是个幸运女孩。一切都会好起来的。
[00:18:04.100] If, you know, it's not working out right now, it will eventually reach that point. And I guess it's almost like third person in yourself into instead of being like, I believe in myself. It's more like I believe that things will work out. And like that detachment makes it a little easier to maybe say to yourself or believe sometimes. Oh, I like that a lot. Yeah. Like kind of going outside of your first person, probably skewed perspective is really powerful.
[00:18:04.100] 你知道，如果现在事情进展不顺利，最终也会走到那一步。我觉得这就像是用第三人称审视自己，而不是像“我相信自己”那样，而是更像“我相信事情会好起来的”。这种抽离感让你更容易对自己说“哦，我很喜欢这种感觉”。是的，跳出第一人称视角（那种可能带有偏见的视角）真的很有力量。
[00:18:30.460] And when it comes to finding ways out of my negative self-talk, a practice that I've really cultivated that makes a huge change. I don't know if you guys have heard of internal family systems. IFS? Nope. Oh, what a revelation. It's becoming more popularized. And it's basically this notion that within each of us, there are many parts. So when it says internal family systems, it's not like your actual family. It's the family of parts within your own consciousness. There's parts of you that are, I'll speak for myself, the drill sergeant who was formed.
[00:18:30.460] 说到如何摆脱消极的自我对话，我一直在练习一种方法，它真的带来了巨大的改变。不知道你们有没有听说过内在家庭系统（IFS）？没有。哦，真是个惊人的发现。它现在越来越流行了。它的基本理念是，我们每个人内心都包含着许多部分。所以，当它提到内在家庭系统时，指的不是你实际的家庭，而是你意识内部的各个部分组成的“家庭”。就我个人而言，你内心的一些部分就像一个严厉的教官。
[00:18:59.380] I'm using that as a term that I use. You can say whatever. But the critic, right? From an early age that was like, not enough, not enough. You're a failure if you don't do this. Keep on going. And it's just whipping me into shape. And then there's other parts of me that might be more tender, more vulnerable, more childlike, whatever. And it's this host of personalities that live in us at any given time. And it's figuring out. Let's say, for example, I've had so many times in my 20s where it's always about my career more often than anything. Oh, my God. This is such an impossible career choice.
[00:18:59.380] 我用这个词来指代我自己。你可以随便说。但批评家，对吧？从小我就被灌输“不够好，不够好”的观念。如果你做不到这一点，你就是个失败者。继续努力。这就像鞭策我不断进步。然后，我身上还有其他一些更温柔、更脆弱、更孩子气的部分，等等。我们每个人在任何时候都同时拥有多种不同的性格。而关键在于找到它们之间的平衡。比如说，在我二十多岁的时候，我常常会想，我的事业永远比什么都重要。天哪，这简直是个不可能完成的职业选择。
[00:19:28.100] You should have been further along by now. I'm only paying attention to people who are further along than me. I feel so useless. I feel like so forsaken, whatever. In IFS, it's this notion that you would speak to that part of you who is experiencing that as yourself, which is a different part. The part of you that there's like eight C's. I'm not going to remember all of them, but it's like calm, confident, all these different things that are accessible to us at any given time.
[00:19:28.100] 你现在应该走得更远才对。我只关注那些比我走得远的人。我感觉自己好没用，感觉自己好被抛弃，总之就是这样。在内在家庭系统疗法（IFS）中，你会和自己内心那个正在经历这一切的部分对话，那是另一个不同的部分。你内心有八个“C”。我记不住所有“C”，但比如平静、自信等等，这些都是我们随时都可以体验到的不同状态。
[00:19:55.200] It's really like your soul, like the most peaceful part within you and the most loving part within you. And you speak to this part of you as if it were a child. And it probably is. This is probably from your childhood. And you say to that part of you, the comfort or the validation that you so desperately seek, you can give that to yourself. Right. So for me, it would look like and oftentimes like using terms of endearment. I know it sounds kind of corny, but like it helps switch on that third person sort of interaction of like my love or like honey, sweetie, whatever.
[00:19:55.200] 它就像你的灵魂，就像你内心最平静、最充满爱的部分。你要像对待孩子一样和自己内心的这个部分对话。它可能就是个孩子。这很可能源于你的童年。你要告诉自己内心的这个部分，你如此渴望的安慰和认可，你可以自己给予自己。没错。所以对我来说，这通常意味着使用亲昵的称呼。我知道这听起来有点老套，但它确实能帮助我切换到第三人称的互动模式，比如“亲爱的”、“宝贝”、“甜心”等等。
[00:20:24.880] I know these feelings are so big and they're so real, but you could never not be loved by me. I'm rooting for you. I'm your whatever you want to hear. You know, it's like you could never be a failure. Like I've seen the journey and the progress you've been on that no one else has seen. I'm so amazed. I'll do these interactions. And I don't know if you guys know the author, Liz Gilbert, she wrote Eat, Pray, Love, obviously. Like that's pretty huge. But she talks about this process a lot.
[00:20:24.880] 我知道这些感觉如此强烈，如此真实，但我永远不会不爱你。我会一直支持你。你想听什么，我都会说。你知道吗，你永远不会失败。我见证了你一路走来的历程和进步，那是别人看不到的。我太佩服你了。我会继续和你交流。我不知道你们是否认识莉兹·吉尔伯特，她写了《吃、祈祷、爱》，这当然是一本非常经典的书。她也经常谈到这个过程。
[00:20:52.740] Speaking to yourself or writing a letter to yourself from the perspective of love itself. And it is so healing because you realize that we all have a reservoir of this within us at any given time. And if you can just be like loose enough or imaginative enough to channel it, again, it sounds corny. But I had it within me all along to move myself through this process. And so often I'll speak for myself. It's reaching outside of myself. Who can give me this validation? Who can tell me my career is going to be OK?
[00:20:52.740] 从爱的角度对自己说话，或者给自己写封信。这真的很有疗愈作用，因为你会意识到，我们每个人内心深处都蕴藏着爱的源泉。如果你能足够放松，或者足够有想象力去引导它，我知道这听起来有点老套，但我一直都有这种能力去完成这个过程。我常常会替自己说话。这其实是在向外寻求答案。谁能给我这种肯定？谁能告诉我，我的事业会好起来的？
[00:21:21.520] Who can tell me I'm going to find my life partner someday? That's actually why my podcast is called You Found Her. Because I always joked that my future Hollywood memoir would be called You Found Her. Because people were like, we're looking for the next super talented multi-hyphenate. We're looking for the next Asian American whatever the hell voice to pitch this project. And I was like, You Found Her. You Found Her. I'm so worthy. I'm so competent. I'm exactly what you're looking for. Please take a chance on me.
[00:21:21.520] 谁能告诉我我总有一天会找到我的另一半？其实这就是我的播客叫《你找到了她》的原因。因为我一直开玩笑说，我未来的好莱坞回忆录就叫《你找到了她》。因为人们总是说，我们在寻找下一个超级有才华的多面手。我们在寻找下一个亚裔美国人，不管是什么身份，来推销这个项目。我就说，你找到了她。你找到了她。我这么优秀。我这么能干。我就是你们要找的人。请给我一个机会吧。
[00:21:46.300] Please see me waiting for these external eyes and gatekeepers to validate me that I was legitimate, that I deserved this chance. And naturally, when we're ambitious, we do kind of have to do that. We have to look outside of ourselves for support. But really, the work of my lifetime, at least thus far, and in my career and in my self-love journey, has been recognizing this very thing. You can and maybe you must give it to yourself. If you're going to keep waiting for other people to do it, here's the thing.
[00:21:46.300] 请看看我一直在等待外界的审视和认可，证明我的价值，证明我配得上这个机会。当然，当我们雄心勃勃时，确实需要这样做。我们需要向外寻求支持。但实际上，我毕生的事业，至少到目前为止，以及我的自我关爱之旅，都在努力认识到这一点。你可以，或许也必须，给予自己这份认可。如果你还要继续等待别人来做这件事，那么请记住这一点。
[00:22:16.300] You'll get it. But if you don't actually believe it within yourself, it's in one, you're out the other. I mean, how many times have you had to seek validation from people and it's the same shit? You're beautiful. Well, trust me, like I'm attracted to you or whatever it is, you know? Like hopefully none of us have been down that road. But, you know, there's plenty of others. I feel like the way you describe it is almost like self-love is a muscle. And some of us are so good at using it. Your self-love can squat like 60 pounds or whatever.
[00:22:16.300] 你会明白的。但如果你内心深处并不相信，那就不是你相信自己，而是你不相信自己。我的意思是，你多少次需要从别人那里寻求认可，结果却总是听到同样的话？“你很漂亮。” 好吧，相信我，好像我真的被你吸引了似的，你知道吗？希望我们都没经历过那种事。但是，你知道，还有很多其他情况。我觉得你描述的方式就像是在说，自爱就像一块肌肉。我们中的一些人非常擅长运用它。你的自爱可以让你轻松举起60磅的重量。
[00:22:45.700] And for many of us, it's like something that's never been stretched and used. And I feel like you're so right. It is something that I notice when I'm actively practicing it and actively reminding myself to perform the self-love. Even if it's just me going through the motions for that day, it seems to get easier and easier. And the day that I stopped doing it, the day that I let the negativity compound, it gets so much harder to kind of reactivate. Totally.
[00:22:45.700] 对我们很多人来说，这就像一件从未被充分运用过的事情。我觉得你说得太对了。当我积极练习、主动提醒自己要爱自己时，我就会注意到这一点。即使只是例行公事地做一天，似乎也会越来越容易。而一旦我停止练习，任由负面情绪滋生，就很难再重新激活它。完全同意。
[00:23:12.400] And I find that like this actually happened to me recently where I kind of fell off the wagon in terms of my practice. It's easy to do, especially if you're distracted. And oftentimes the distraction is work. Even if it's like fulfilling work, it can be distracting or like a relationship that's exciting you at the moment. Next thing I knew, I was not doing my shit. I was not paying attention to my mindfulness. I was not really just sitting in like silence with my thoughts on a regular basis and just checking in.
[00:23:12.400] 我发现最近我也遇到了类似的情况，我的练习有点懈怠了。这种情况很容易发生，尤其是在分心的时候。而分心的事物往往是工作。即使是很有成就感的工作，或者一段让你兴奋的感情，都可能分散我的注意力。不知不觉中，我就什么都做不了了。我没有专注于正念练习。我没有像以前那样，定期静下心来，静静地思考，审视自己的内心。
[00:23:39.400] I found that like once I started going in the spiral of I could feel this almost like manic energy to push myself, to prove myself, to impress, to like hit certain metrics again. And I got lost and I actually could feel myself not wanting help, like resisting the call to the things that I've already learned. It's like I suddenly forgot. I was like, well, listen, I know I could talk to my friends about this. I know I could go work out.
[00:23:39.400] 我发现一旦陷入这种恶性循环，我就会感到一种近乎狂躁的能量，驱使我不断鞭策自己，证明自己，给人留下深刻印象，再次达到某些指标。然后我就迷失了方向，甚至感觉自己不想寻求帮助，抗拒着那些我已经学到的东西。就好像我突然忘记了似的。我当时想，好吧，我知道我可以和朋友们聊聊这些。我知道我可以去锻炼。
[00:24:05.320] I know I could stop being on social media, but because of its toxicity and its nature, you're kind of like, no, but this is kind of that's why we stick in it. It's like I've got this, you know, like this. This is pushing me to really hit the marks. And I like that feeling. It's kind of like a drug. And it's like like drugs. It's like you hit kind of like even if it's a little rock bottom where you're like, oh, I'm not well anymore. I have not left my apartment. I have not connected with my best friend. I have not properly left.
[00:24:05.320] 我知道我可以停止使用社交媒体，但因为它的毒性和本质，你会觉得，不，但这正是我们坚持下去的原因。就像我掌控着它，你知道吗？它驱使我不断努力，力求完美。我喜欢这种感觉。它有点像毒品。就像毒品一样，即使你跌入谷底，感觉自己“不行了”，甚至“我还没离开过公寓，我没和最好的朋友联系，我还没真正离开”，它也能让你重新振作起来。
[00:24:33.680] You have to hit whatever version that is for you and to come kind of wake up again. And it's that I think maybe the journey to self-love is being aware, period. You're never going to just be self-loving like from today till forever. Right. It's it's always oscillating like any human's mind is. Yeah. And I feel like it's so true that you can get swept away by whatever distractions or whatever crazy thing is happening in life. You forget to self-regulate.
[00:24:33.680] 你必须经历你认为属于你的那个阶段，然后重新振作起来。我觉得，通往自爱的旅程或许就是保持觉察，仅此而已。你不可能从今天到永远都自爱。没错。它总是像任何人的思维一样，不断波动。是的。我觉得你说得太对了，你会被生活中的各种干扰或疯狂的事情所裹挟，忘记自我调节。
[00:25:00.300] And then when you think back on it, right, kind of like what you're saying, you're just thinking, well, I've lasted this long already. I can keep going. But yeah, no one can last that long with no rest at all in between. Like it's OK to take breaks and mental breaks count, too. And I feel like that's something that is just so easily forgotten. Maybe once you do slow down and rest, then you're like, oh, my God, I needed this so badly. Totally. I'm a big fan of metaphor.
[00:25:00.300] 然后当你回想起来，就像你说的，你会想，嗯，我已经坚持这么久了，还能继续。但是，真的没人能一直不休息就坚持那么久。休息一下是完全可以的，精神上的放松也很重要。我觉得这一点很容易被遗忘。也许一旦你慢下来休息一下，你就会想，天哪，我太需要休息了。确实如此。我很喜欢用比喻。
[00:25:29.020] Naturally, I'm I'm a nerdy writer. But the metaphor I often use with my friends and I've I've felt this way, like you have a boat, like you have an option. You're in the ocean and you could do that. But it's kind of thrilling to like be on the like like ramshackle surfboard and like feel the thrill of the wave. And I've got this. It's like some kind of heroism or rugged individuality or something like that.
[00:25:29.020] 当然，我是一个有点书呆子气的作家。但我经常和朋友们用一个比喻，我自己也有过这样的感受：就像你有一艘船，你有很多选择。你在大海上，你可以选择那样做。但站在一块破旧的冲浪板上，感受海浪的刺激，感觉很刺激。而且我掌握了它。这就像某种英雄主义，或者说是一种坚韧不拔的个性，诸如此类。
[00:25:54.020] It's the adrenaline and it's the rush of doing it all on your own, even if you are not handling it. Everyone's watching you, that goofy chick in the middle of that tidal wave. And they're like, she's off her rocker, you know, but you're just not seeing it clearly. You have resources. People want to help you. Not even just people, but like the call map wants to help you, whatever it might be. I'll speak for myself. You're in that crazed state of like maybe you actually did hit a certain metric and it's kind of like intoxicating.
[00:25:54.020] 那是肾上腺素飙升的感觉，是独自完成一切的刺激，即使你根本应付不来。每个人都在看着你，看着那个身处巨浪中心的傻妞。他们会说，她疯了，你知道吗？但你却看不清这一点。你有资源。有人想帮你。不只是人，连呼叫中心都想帮你，不管是什么。就我个人而言，你处于一种疯狂的状态，感觉自己可能真的达到了某个指标，那种感觉简直令人陶醉。
[00:26:24.020] And you're like, I want to, this is how people have become over workers and like addicted to like workaholism. You know, unfortunately this trope, this mythology of this billionaire or multi-multi-millionaire that gets it all and then kills themselves. Because I'm sorry to say it's been said by many very successful people that feeling you think is waiting for you at the end of the finish line, at the end of the rainbow is not going to be what you think it is.
[00:26:24.020] 然后你会想，我想说，人们就是这样变得过度劳累，甚至沉迷于工作狂的。你知道，不幸的是，这种关于亿万富翁或千万富翁最终自杀的刻板印象，这种神话，其实并不普遍。因为很遗憾，很多成功人士都说过，你以为在终点线、彩虹尽头等待着你的东西，最终可能并非你所想的那样。
[00:26:51.060] If you have innately a lot of issues around not enoughness, which who doesn't, or inadequacy or like looking to other people, looking outside of yourself for validation. If you think that getting that jackpot is going to be the salve, you are wrong. People have been telling me, I've listened to all the podcasts, like all the growth mindset podcasts. People have been telling me that for years. And I was like, sure, sure. But it's going to be different for me. It's going to feel like really good. And I think it will indeed solve all my problems.
[00:26:51.060] 如果你天生就有很多关于“不够好”或“能力不足”的问题（谁不是呢？），或者喜欢依赖他人，从外界寻求认可，那么如果你认为中了头奖就能解决所有问题，那就大错特错了。人们一直跟我说这些，我听过所有关于成长型思维的播客，真的。这些年来，人们一直这么跟我说。我当时想，行了行了，但对我来说肯定不一样。感觉肯定会很好。而且我觉得它真的能解决我所有的问题。
[00:27:20.200] So thanks for the cautionary tale. But I'm an exception, which is how we all feel about ourselves. Cut to me, like reaching new metrics, getting new things. And I'm like happy for three days. And I'm like, okay, yeah, I'm not happy anymore. Let's find the next. It's like, look at your damn self. You know, I think part of this could be we're always fed stories in the media of people being the one or like why is someone, you know, suddenly so unique compared to everyone else.
[00:27:20.200] 所以，谢谢你的警示故事。但我是个例外，其实我们每个人都觉得自己是个例外。比如，我达成了新的成就，得到了新的东西。我高兴了三天，然后就觉得，好吧，我不再高兴了。我们去找下一个目标吧。这就像，好好看看你自己。你知道，我觉得部分原因可能是媒体总是给我们灌输这样的故事：有些人是独一无二的，或者为什么某人突然变得如此与众不同。
[00:27:48.420] I mean, like prime example could be superhero movies because they've been really popular in the past decade or so. So then it's kind of ingrained in everyone's minds like, oh, I could be that like superhero. Yes. Whatever that means in our reality, we're like so obsessed with finding what makes ourselves unique and what's going to propel us to like the top of the leaderboard for whatever niche trait or whatever. That's so true. I always think about what's it like.
[00:27:48.420] 我的意思是，超级英雄电影就是个绝佳的例子，因为它们在过去十年左右的时间里非常流行。所以，这种想法已经深深地烙印在每个人的脑海中，比如，哦，我也可以成为那样的超级英雄。是的。无论这在我们的现实生活中意味着什么，我们都痴迷于寻找让自己与众不同的东西，以及什么能让我们在某个小众领域或其他方面脱颖而出。这真是太对了。我总是会思考这种感觉。
[00:28:16.740] And well, I don't know if it's great in Japan. I think they have a pretty toxic work culture, too. But other countries in the world that are not as fixated on success as the metric of everything. Like, you know, it's America. We love the superhero. I mean, it's all we've got pretty much. And I don't know if y'all were also raised on Disney films. And obviously we had Disney princesses.
[00:28:16.740] 嗯，我不知道日本的情况怎么样。我觉得他们的工作文化也挺糟糕的。但世界上其他一些国家，不像日本那样把成功看得那么重，什么都要用指标来衡量。比如，你知道，美国。我们热爱超级英雄。我的意思是，我们几乎就只有这些了。我不知道你们是不是也从小看迪士尼电影长大的。当然，我们也有迪士尼公主。
[00:28:37.240] But to a certain degree, it's like, yeah, we all want to believe there's something exceptional or extraordinary about us that is going to make us stand out, make us like the savior of our community, make our friends and family proud of us. And suddenly it redeems all the toxic crap that happened along the way. Like, you know, obviously there's pros and cons to this this hero of your own life story. The pros are actually that there's some beauty in being the architect of your own story with you as the hero in the center.
[00:28:37.240] 但在某种程度上，我们都想相信自己身上有某种非凡或特别之处，能让我们脱颖而出，成为社区的救世主，让亲朋好友为我们感到骄傲。仿佛这样就能洗刷一路走来所有糟糕的经历。当然，把自己塑造成人生英雄有利有弊。好处在于，能够成为自己故事的缔造者，以自己为中心，这本身就蕴含着一种美。
[00:29:07.020] And I have been empowered by that. If I felt disempowered, if I felt like disenfranchised or certainly as an Asian American female writer in Hollywood, I don't often feel like the hero. But to be able to say, no, I fucking am. Look at these stories I'm writing. They're like so subversive and powerful and like flipping the bird to like every fictional tale about Asian woman everywhere. So it's powerful. But then the negative price of it is if you think that something is waiting or you think that something will change fundamentally.
[00:29:07.020] 而这给了我力量。如果我感到无力，如果我感到被剥夺了权利，或者更确切地说，作为一名在好莱坞的亚裔美国女性作家，我通常不会觉得自己是英雄。但现在我可以自信地说，不，我就是。看看我写的这些故事。它们如此颠覆传统，如此震撼人心，就像是在对所有关于亚裔女性的虚构故事竖中指。所以，这很有力量。但它的负面影响在于，如果你认为某些事情正在等待着发生，或者你认为某些事情会发生根本性的改变。
[00:29:36.260] The gift you can give yourself is realizing you don't have to wait for that moment to feel enough. Is that really all you think you deserve? You have to become a millionaire and then you're going to be fine. I mean, don't you want to enjoy your life before, for God's sake? Don't you want to be content with whatever, like your beauty, your career, like today? Why tomorrow is not guaranteed? It's a hard question to confront, but like it's definitely one that I've had to face more than once.
[00:29:36.260] 你能送给自己的礼物就是明白，你不必等到那一刻才觉得自己足够好。难道你真的认为自己只配拥有这些吗？非得成为百万富翁才能过上好日子？我的意思是，看在上帝的份上，难道你不想在成为百万富翁之前好好享受生活吗？难道你不想对拥有的一切感到满足吗？比如你的美貌、你的事业，比如今天？为什么明天无法保证？这是一个难以面对的问题，但我确实不止一次地面对过它。
[00:30:04.280] I feel like a lot of it is how do we rewrite the metric that we use to, I guess, judge or evaluate our success or happiness or like the joys of our own life. And that's really difficult because like you both were talking about, we're fed a lot of what is good or successful or what we should strive for through the media. And to me, half of it is just straight up nefarious. Like it's way easier to sell something to someone when you're telling them, oh, you're not enough because you don't have this product.
[00:30:04.280] 我觉得关键在于我们如何重新定义衡量成功、幸福或人生乐趣的标准。这真的很难，因为就像你们刚才说的，媒体给我们灌输了很多关于什么是好的、什么是成功的、什么是我们应该追求的东西。在我看来，其中一半简直就是别有用心。比如，当你告诉别人“你不够好，因为你没有这个产品”的时候，推销产品就容易多了。
[00:30:34.080] It's very much rooted just in the system. But the other half is, you know, sometimes people like structure. It's hard to define what is happiness for you. It's way easier for me to just read a BuzzFeed article and be like, okay, this is the checklist to happiness or like a great late 20s. I don't know. Maybe that's what post-realization is our goal, right? Like how do we kind of take all of this energy? It's some sort of energy, right, that is driving this self-talk.
[00:30:34.080] 这很大程度上根植于体制之中。但另一方面，你知道，有时候人们喜欢结构。很难定义对你而言什么是幸福。对我来说，读一篇 BuzzFeed 的文章，然后说，好吧，这就是幸福清单，或者说，一个美好的二十多岁后半段的指南，要容易得多。我不知道。也许这就是我们觉醒后的目标，对吧？就像我们该如何利用所有这些能量？正是某种能量，对吧，驱动着我们的自我对话。
[00:31:01.340] And then how do we make it something that propels us forward instead of dragging us down? Yeah. The question of the century of our lifetimes. And I totally agree. I mean, my best venture to guess or to say what might have impacted me is that I did this truly life-changing values exercise with my therapist earlier this year. Basically, she presented me on a paper with 200 values. I didn't know there were values on that level.
[00:31:01.340] 那么，我们该如何让它成为推动我们前进而不是拖我们后腿的东西呢？没错，这是我们一生中最重要的问题。我完全同意。就我个人而言，我能想到的最有可能影响到我的，是今年早些时候我和我的心理咨询师一起做了一个真正改变人生的价值观练习。她给我看了一张纸，上面列出了200条价值观。我以前根本不知道价值观竟然有这么丰富的层次。
[00:31:29.400] You know, I thought it was like patience and jealousy, whatever. So I was really surprised, one, to see how many. But she said to me, this was the framework, I want you to consider what your top five values are from this list, understanding that this is the world you're working with. All societal obligations have disappeared. The metrics that you currently understand the world through are gone.
[00:31:29.400] 你知道，我原以为这跟耐心和嫉妒之类的差不多。所以，看到这么多，我真的很惊讶。但她跟我说，这是个框架，我想让你从这个列表中选择你最重要的五项价值观，同时也要明白，这就是你所处的世界。所有的社会义务都消失了。你现在用来理解世界的那些衡量标准也都不复存在了。
[00:31:54.320] You are seeing this through the prism of what is for your joy and your fulfillment only. And nobody else is. Basically, imagine society's wiped out. We're all in a jungle. And like, what are you living for if you had to choose? And I was like, oh, hell. Because what I saw so clearly when I was looking at this list is I saw my like false values. I have this workbook that I made that people can find on my Instagram providing what this test was and what the values were and the questions you can ask yourself because it's really so like mind changing.
[00:31:54.320] 你看待这一切，完全是从你自己的快乐和满足出发的，而忽略了其他人。想象一下，整个社会都毁灭了，我们都身处丛林之中。如果必须做出选择，你究竟为何而活？我当时就想，完了。因为当我审视这份清单时，我清晰地看到了自己错误的价值观。我制作了一本练习册，可以在我的Instagram上找到，里面详细介绍了这项测试的内容、价值观以及你可以问自己的问题，因为它真的能彻底改变你的思维方式。
[00:32:22.880] It's all these false values of achievement, success, money. I mean, I'm going to be honest and say that those were actually driving me. Even though I may not have said it out loud because it sounds like disgusting. That's what our culture tells us. It's not my fault. It's not any of our fault if we feel motivated by those things. So I was really, really driven by achievement and the like. And in this new framework, I was like, I don't give a fuck about those things anymore. That's a revelation.
[00:32:22.880] 都是些关于成就、成功、金钱的虚假价值观。说实话，这些才是真正驱使我的东西。虽然我可能没说出口，因为这听起来很恶心。这就是我们的文化告诉我们的。如果我们被这些东西所激励，那不是我的错，也不是我们任何人的错。所以我曾经真的非常非常在意成就之类的东西。但在这种新的视角下，我突然意识到，我再也不在乎这些东西了。这对我来说是一种顿悟。
[00:32:49.400] What I actually care about, and I'll just list some of my true values that I decided on with my therapist, are significance, inspiration, spirituality in the case for me, amusement, which I just see as like the spirit of play and like humor and life. And bravery, which in my case is not like being Mulan, although I would like to draw the comp, but it's really internal bravery, like willingness to confront challenging situations head on. Right.
[00:32:49.400] 我真正关心的，我列举一些我和我的心理咨询师共同确定的价值观，包括意义、灵感、对我而言的精神层面、娱乐（我把它理解为玩乐的精神、幽默和生活本身）。还有勇气，对我来说，它不是像花木兰那样，虽然我很想把它比作花木兰，但它指的是内在的勇气，比如愿意直面挑战。没错。
[00:33:15.440] What's fascinating to me is that the values are not like a world apart. Right. Achievement is not completely on a different planet from inspiration and significance, but they are distinctly different. And once my therapist, she said to me, you're here because you're not well and you're not happy. And it's because you've been pursuing your values of achievement, success and money. How's that working out for you? Not so good.
[00:33:15.440] 让我着迷的是，这些价值观并非截然相反。没错。成就与灵感和意义并非完全不在一个层面上，但它们确实截然不同。我的心理咨询师曾经对我说：“你来这里是因为你身心俱疲，并不快乐。这是因为你一直在追求成就、成功和金钱这些价值观。结果如何呢？不太好。”
[00:33:39.700] But that's because they're not your true values, because if they were your true values, you wouldn't have to break yourself in order to live by them, which you are. Your true values will invigorate you and give you life. Once I did that mind shift of like, oh, when I'm not feeling myself or I'm comparing myself or I feel inadequate, whatever, I'm like, OK, well, what I know is that I'm probably here because of my false values. I'm probably here because I got convinced that achievement was going to fix this. It did not. Now let me go to the true values.
[00:33:39.700] 但那是因为它们并非你真正的价值观。如果它们是你真正的价值观，你就不会为了遵循它们而自我折磨，而你现在却在这样做。你真正的价值观会让你充满活力，赋予你生命。一旦我转变了思维方式，比如，当我感觉不好、与人比较、或者觉得自己不够好等等的时候，我就会想，好吧，我知道我之所以会陷入这种境地，很可能是因为我错误的价值观。我之所以会陷入这种境地，很可能是因为我误以为成就可以解决一切问题。但事实并非如此。现在，让我去寻找真正的价值观吧。
[00:34:08.080] I love inspiring or feeling significance through connection, whether that's through like my community with YouFounder or really more often than not. It's just going to my friends, hanging out. I have a book club that I run every month, going salsa dancing with a few different girls, like things that have nothing to do with my career. Then I feel fulfilled and I'm like, oh, actually, this is what I want out of my life. I've just gotten it so confused by the cultural narrative that I'm supposed to want money and achievement and success.
[00:34:08.080] 我喜欢通过与人建立联系来获得启发或感受到意义，无论是通过像YouFounder这样的社群，还是更多时候，只是和朋友们聚聚。我每个月都会组织一个读书俱乐部，还会和几个不同的女孩一起去跳莎莎舞，这些都是与我的事业无关的事情。然后我会感到充实，心想，哦，原来这才是我想要的生活。我之前一直被文化叙事误导，以为我应该追求金钱、成就和成功。
[00:34:36.560] Success. That's wild, man. I think it also starts to become clear when you pointed out like, you know, achievement, success. These are kind of false values. And when you really start to dig into it, what does that even mean? You know, like what does achievement mean and what does success mean? It's such a if you really think about it, it's such a meaningless word. It's meaningless. Yeah, like it's different for everyone. When you say I want success, that is an empty sentence.
[00:34:36.560] 成功？这太荒谬了。我觉得当你指出成就、成功这些概念的时候，一切就都明白了。它们其实都是虚假的价值。当你真正深入思考的时候，你会发现它们到底意味着什么？成就和成功到底意味着什么？仔细想想，它们其实都是毫无意义的词。真的毫无意义。没错，每个人对成功的定义都不一样。当你说“我想要成功”的时候，那只是一句空话。
[00:35:05.480] Maybe if you said something more specific, I want to hit that one salsa dancing move. That's like success. You know, that feels much more meaningful of content valuable. And so I think once you pointed that out, I was like, you're so right. Like not only are they false values, they're also kind of empty values.
[00:35:05.480] 如果你说得更具体些，比如“我想学会一个莎莎舞动作”，那就好了。那才叫成功。你知道，这样感觉更有意义，更有价值。所以我觉得你指出这一点之后，我就觉得，你说得太对了。它们不仅是虚假的价值观，而且还是空洞的价值观。
[00:35:23.800] Totally. And I think for me, it was like, well, clearly, if this framework is what other people are perceiving and judging me by versus my joy, my fulfillment, clearly what success meant to me was some sense that other people would perceive me as successful. That sucks. That means I'm living my life for everybody but me. No wonder I wasn't happy. Right. You know, have you guys heard of the Enneagram? Oh, yeah.
[00:35:23.800] 完全正确。我觉得对我来说，这就好比，如果别人用这种框架来评判我，而不是用我的快乐和满足感，那么很明显，成功对我来说就意味着别人觉得我成功。这太糟糕了。这意味着我活着是为了别人，而不是为了我自己。难怪我不快乐。对。你们听说过九型人格吗？哦，当然。
[00:35:49.620] It helps you understand your personality through the lens of like your childhood wound. It's deep and it's profound. But I'm classic and I'm sure many listeners are classic type three, the performer, the achiever, like searching for worth in the form of exterior validation and achievement. And our journey is to hopefully know that it's innate and we have it or we're born with it and it never leaves us. But I took this test and it also read me for filth because it was telling me about my blind spots. And that's what they were because I was not aware.
[00:35:49.620] 它能帮助你从童年创伤的角度理解自己的性格。这很深刻，也很有意义。但我属于典型的第三型人格，我相信很多听众也是，他们是典型的表演者、成就者，喜欢通过外在的认可和成就来寻求价值。而我们的旅程，或许就是最终明白，这种价值是与生俱来的，我们生来就拥有它，而且它永远不会离开我们。但我做了这个测试，结果也把我彻底看穿了，因为它指出了我的盲点。而这正是盲点所在，因为我之前对此一无所知。
[00:36:19.100] But then when it was spelled out for me, it said image. And I was like, no, no, I'm not some shallow, like vapid girl that cares about my image. I had an idea of what image meant. I care about how I look or something like that. No, really, image is caring what people think about you. And what I cared about was not how I looked or my desirability in a romantic sense or anything.
[00:36:19.100] 但当别人给我解释清楚之后，我说的是“形象”。我当时就想，不，不，我不是那种肤浅、空洞、只在乎形象的女孩。我之前对“形象”的含义有所了解。我可能在乎自己的外表之类的。不，说真的，“形象”就是在乎别人怎么看你。而我在乎的根本不是自己的外表，也不是我在爱情方面的吸引力之类的。
[00:36:44.440] What I cared about is that when people met me, colleagues, whatever, in my work life, that they walked away feeling certain that I was an achiever and that I was successful and that I was smart. If I did not stick the landing there, then I had failed myself. And why would someone do something like that? It's because they're convinced that if they're not those things, then they are worthless. So you spend your whole life ensuring that no one will question it, that when people meet you, you form a personality off of that.
[00:36:44.440] 我最在意的是，当人们——同事、同事，或者任何与我工作相关的人——见到我时，他们离开时都能确信我是一个有成就的人，一个成功人士，一个聪明人。如果我没能做到这一点，那就是我的失败。为什么有人会这样做呢？因为他们深信，如果自己不具备这些特质，就一文不值。所以，你终其一生都在努力确保没有人质疑这一点，确保人们见到你时，都能基于此来塑造你的形象。
[00:37:13.900] In many ways, being a writer for me, I decided when I was really young, like 10, 11, 12, it's because I was being really relentlessly bullied. And I was convinced by this bully that I was worthless and I felt really disempowered and voiceless. And I decided I don't want to feel this way anymore. What would it feel like to be brave? One of my top five values. What would it feel like to be significant? One of my top five values, right? I wish I had a voice. Who has a voice? Writers.
[00:37:13.900] 在很多方面，我之所以成为一名作家，是因为我很小的时候，大概十岁、十一岁、十二岁的时候，就一直遭受着无情的霸凌。霸凌者让我觉得自己一文不值，我感到无比无助，没有发言权。我决定不再让自己有这种感觉。勇敢会是什么感觉？这是我最看重的五大价值观之一。有意义又会是什么感觉？这也是我最看重的五大价值观之一，对吧？我多么希望自己能发出声音。谁能发出声音？作家。
[00:37:42.300] You know, who can enact power and change through their own words? Writers. It drove everything. I completely forgot how we got here. I'm not going to lie to you. I have no idea, but I was so captivated by that story. And I'm like, I do like financial forecasting stuff and I need to create a story just as good as that one. Well, you know, of course, when you're living in the story at the moment, it's not feeling all that noble.
[00:37:42.300] 你知道，谁能通过文字的力量改变世界？作家。一切都源于此。我完全忘了我们是怎么走到这一步的。说实话，我也不知道，但我当时完全被那个故事迷住了。然后我就想，我确实喜欢做金融预测，我也得写出一个跟它一样精彩的故事。当然，你知道，当你身处故事之中时，那种感觉可就没那么高尚了。
[00:38:09.400] It's only it's only in hindsight where I'm like, no, wait a second. Why am I here? And why are we drawn towards certain things? And it's because it's always kind of, I think, healing or correcting whatever you perceive is true for you currently. Whatever, again, the story is about who you are. And so I think, I don't know about you guys, but a lot of the times, especially I have a lot of artist friends being one myself. That's what drove us here. And that is for better and for worse. Because a lot of people who are drawn to Hollywood, like me, ding, ding, ding, are not for healthy reasons.
[00:38:09.400] 只有在事后回想时，我才会想，等等，我为什么会在这里？为什么我们会被某些事物吸引？我认为这是因为，它总是在某种程度上治愈或纠正你目前所认为的真相。无论如何，故事的核心在于你是谁。所以我想，我不知道你们怎么想，但很多时候，尤其是我有很多艺术家朋友（我自己也是），正是这种理念驱使我们来到这里。这有利有弊。因为很多像我一样被好莱坞吸引的人，叮叮叮，并非出于健康的原因。
[00:38:38.480] It's because you're convinced that you are so unseen, like the childlike version of you, so unseen, so insignificant. And Hollywood holds this mythical promise that you will be famous. And when you are famous, you will matter because you will matter to the masses. My best friend is a doctor. He's becoming a doctor. He's at like the top dermatology school in the country. And I confess to him that like this is a wounded part of myself because I was bullied.
[00:38:38.480] 那是因为你觉得自己如此默默无闻，就像孩童时代的自己一样，如此渺小，如此微不足道。而好莱坞却许诺你会成名，并以此为神话。成名之后，你就会变得重要，因为你对大众来说就很重要。我最好的朋友是一名医生，他正在努力成为一名医生，就读于全国顶尖的皮肤科医学院。我向他坦白，这其实是我内心深处的伤痛，因为我曾遭受过霸凌。
[00:39:03.880] And because of the suffering that I had in that capacity, like I wanted to be famous really bad. A lot of people do, you know, there's no shame. But I wanted to just be seen. I said to him, like, this is a younger version of me. Like, I will know that I'm successful when I am celebrated by the masses. Like, I want to hear the masses chanting my name. And he was like, holy shit, you've got some baggage, man. Like, you need some help.
[00:39:03.880] 因为我在那份工作中遭受的痛苦，我特别渴望成名。很多人都这样，你知道，这没什么丢人的。但我只是想被人看见。我对他说，这就像是年轻时的我。我觉得只有被大众认可，我才算成功。我想听到大众高呼我的名字。他听了之后说，我的天，你背负的包袱太重了。你需要帮助。
[00:39:31.480] I'm also an Aries, okay, zodiac wise. I don't know if that has any traction here. I'm an Aries too. You are? Yeah. Amazing. Aries are known as like the Trojan warrior. Like, they're the leader. They are the initiator. There's this sort of like indomitable strength. And again, like, that's all good shit. But when you apply the Aries to this narrative, it's not so good because you're a conqueror.
[00:39:31.480] 我也是白羊座，好吧，就星座而言。我不知道这跟这里有没有关系。我也是白羊座。你也是？是啊。太棒了。白羊座就像特洛伊战士一样。他们是领导者，是开拓者。他们有一种不可战胜的力量。再说一遍，这些都是很好的说法。但是当你把白羊座的特质应用到这个故事里时，就没那么好了，因为你代表的是征服者。
[00:39:58.820] So I'm like basically getting the thrill out of this conquest to become somebody. And I'm so dauntless in my pursuit of it. And I said to my best friend, like, you know what I mean? Like, you feel this way? And he was like, definitely not. Like, I just like, I don't want to be known by the masses. That sounds like a fucking nightmare. I want to help people one-to-one. Like, I want to have real connections and be a doctor and like save lives. And I was like, but what if you are never known? What if people don't?
[00:39:58.820] 所以，我基本上就是从这种征服自我、成为某个重要人物的快感中获得了满足感。而且我为此无所畏惧。我跟我最好的朋友说，你明白我的意思吗？你也有这种感觉吗？他说，绝对没有。我说，我不想被大众熟知。那听起来简直是噩梦。我想一对一地帮助别人。我想建立真正的人际关系，成为一名医生，拯救生命。然后我就想，但如果你永远不为人知呢？如果人们不认识你呢？
[00:40:26.900] And he's like, why do you care about that so much? That's so funny. I had a look in the mirror. I feel like I can relate to some of that. There's definitely that driven, ambitious side of the Aries. But then my moon is Taurus, which just wants to like stay at home and rest all day. So it's like a constant war. What's your rising? My rising is Gemini. See, I would have guessed you were a Taurus. So I would have thought that was your rising. I love Tauruses so much, to be clear. Like, that's awesome.
[00:40:26.900] 他问我，你为什么这么在意这个？真好笑。我照了照镜子，感觉自己好像也有点这种感觉。白羊座确实有那种积极进取、雄心勃勃的一面。但我的月亮星座是金牛座，金牛座就只想待在家里休息一天。所以就像一场永无休止的拉锯战。你的上升星座是什么？我的上升星座是双子座。你看，我本来以为你是金牛座，所以会以为你的上升星座是双子座。说实话，我超喜欢金牛座的。真的，太棒了！
[00:40:55.880] But my girl's in Aries. It's a constant battle, you know? I'm like, I could just like lounge around on the couch all day. Or I could go out and do something. And like conquer the world. Yeah, exactly. The world. Yep. No big deal. Good luck, you know? What are you, Jisoo, in terms of your signs? I'm a Leo. I don't know what the other metrics are, but I'm a Leo. Wonderful. So I think that's, are we all fire signs? We're all fire signs. Oh, yeah. We're just like fireballs over here.
[00:40:55.880] 但我女朋友是白羊座。你知道吗？这简直就是一场持久战。我感觉，我可以整天窝在沙发上，也可以出去做点什么，征服世界。对，没错，征服世界。嗯，没什么大不了的。祝你好运，你知道吗？Jisoo，你的星座是什么？我是狮子座。我不知道其他星座的星座特征，但我肯定是狮子座。太好了。所以，我们都是火象星座吗？我们都是火象星座。哦，对。我们就像火球一样。
[00:41:24.960] But Jisoo, you don't come across to me as like a fire sign. Like, I'm curious what your rising is. Like, let's find out and tell the people. I'll have to do some research on that. But I'm like a closet Leo, you know? Like, you wouldn't know. I know. But deep down, I'm an entertainer. You live for the people. I love Leos too. Very exciting. Jisoo's like a shy Leo. I am.
[00:41:24.960] 但是Jisoo，你给我的感觉不像火象星座。我很好奇你的上升星座是什么。我们一起查一下，然后告诉大家。我得查一下。但我其实是个隐藏的狮子座，你知道吗？你可能看不出来。我知道。但说到底，我是个艺人。我们为观众而活。我也很喜欢狮子座。很有魅力。Jisoo就像个害羞的狮子座。我也是。
[00:41:51.720] Right, which is a rarity, which is telling me that there's got to be some other things in your chart. Yeah. Yeah, I'll get you on CoStar. Stay tuned. I really like your insight, though, about how a lot of people who felt like they weren't seen in childhood or some point of their life really chase that being known feeling. Yeah. And I think I can definitely relate to that because I grew up in a much less diverse environment for a period of time.
[00:41:51.720] 没错，这确实很少见，说明你的星盘里肯定还有其他因素。嗯，好的，我会把你的信息发到CoStar上。敬请期待。不过，我真的很喜欢你关于很多人在童年或人生某个阶段感觉自己不被关注，从而渴望被理解的见解。是的。我觉得我完全能理解，因为我曾经有一段时间是在一个文化多样性远不如现在的环境中长大的。
[00:42:19.660] And I felt like that did affect me in a sense where it's like, you know, things are good, but it's also a little weird that I don't see people like myself around me. And I don't really know what that means. You know, we're like five-year-olds. And then eventually that turns into like, oh, there's just not a lot of Asian Americans around, I guess. What does that mean? How do we become more seen?
[00:42:19.660] 我觉得这确实在某种程度上影响了我，你知道，虽然一切都很好，但同时又有点奇怪，因为我身边看不到和我一样的人。我真的不知道这意味着什么。你知道，我们就像五岁的孩子一样。然后最终，这种感觉就变成了，哦，大概是因为亚裔美国人真的不多吧。这意味着什么？我们该如何才能被更多人看到？
[00:42:41.500] I think later, though, once I moved to California where there are a lot of Asian Americans, I started to feel a little more comfortable in my difference. I guess at that point it's like similarities with everyone. But yeah, I think that really did drive some certain behavior. Compensation or something. Yeah, right. And so when you said that, I was like, oh, my God, that is such a good point. I never even thought of it that way. But it makes a lot of sense. Oh, yeah. I have the same background.
[00:42:41.500] 不过我觉得后来，搬到加州之后，那里有很多亚裔美国人，我开始慢慢接受自己的不同之处。我想那时候感觉和大家有很多相似之处。但是，我觉得这确实影响了我的一些行为。算是补偿机制之类的吧。对，没错。所以你这么一说，我就想，我的天哪，你说得太对了。我以前从来没这么想过。但确实很有道理。哦，对。我的背景也一样。
[00:43:08.280] I grew up in a really white part of Orange County and felt like an aberration. Like I felt really ashamed. I felt so ashamed of being Asian. I think that plus the bullying, plus whatever else. But really, I think the racial narrative of my life did, in fact, make me feel so other and so unwanted or not belonging. Definitely played a major factor. And like, I want to correct this. Like, what does it feel like to be the popular kid in school? I've never known.
[00:43:08.280] 我在橙县一个白人占绝大多数的地区长大，感觉自己像个异类。我感到非常羞耻，为自己是亚裔而感到无比羞耻。我想，再加上校园霸凌和其他种种因素，确实让我觉得自己格格不入，不受欢迎，没有归属感。这绝对是造成我这种感觉的重要原因。我想改变这种状况。比如，在学校里成为受欢迎的孩子是什么感觉？我从来没有体验过。
[00:43:36.560] Would be nice to know by being famous or whatever. You decide like by being a CEO of your own company, by being the most popping off girl in your mom's book club. Like, you know, whatever it is. Like, we are social primates. We are status driven creatures. And we're looking to figure that out and where we lie in that context. And it's only natural. You know, so don't feel bad if you are inclined to think that way.
[00:43:36.560] 如果能通过成名或其他方式了解这一点就好了。你可以自己决定，比如成为自己公司的CEO，或者成为你妈妈读书俱乐部里最引人注目的女孩。你知道，不管是什么。我们是社会性灵长类动物，我们是受地位驱动的生物。我们想要弄清楚这一点，以及我们在这个群体中的位置。这很正常。所以，如果你有这种想法，也不要觉得不好意思。
[00:44:01.560] But we can also call upon the more sophisticated, wholehearted versions of ourselves to be like, and not going to engage in that today. I am exquisite. I am enough. I am all the things, regardless of these like ever changing hierarchies. And I think it kind of drives that feeling of a I'll show them. Look at me now. Now I've accomplished just as much, if not more, even though I was different. Well said.
[00:44:01.560] 但我们也可以呼唤自己更成熟、更真诚的一面，就像今天这样，不去理会那些事。我很完美。我足够好。我拥有一切，无论这些不断变化的等级制度如何。我认为这在某种程度上激发了“我要让他们看看”的感觉。看看我现在。即使我曾经与众不同，但我现在取得的成就丝毫不逊色于他们，甚至更多。说得好。
[00:44:30.540] I feel like the school districts that we grew up in in the Bay Area were very competitive. So it's kind of like, you know, in the moment you're like, OK, I'm just competing against. You don't have time to think. You're just like, OK, let me just try to like get the best grades I can. But then later you're like, you know, maybe I'm not so much of a STEM person or maybe I'm not meant for all these AP classes and stuff.
[00:44:30.540] 我觉得我们在湾区长大的那些学区竞争非常激烈。所以，你知道，当时你会想，好吧，我得跟别人竞争。你没时间思考。你只会想，好吧，我得尽力拿到最好的成绩。但过一段时间你就会想，也许我不太适合理科，或者也许我不适合上那些AP课程之类的。
[00:44:52.480] And then it's like, well, how can I show everyone else from that area that I am just as successful or just as accomplished as that? That is so real. It's how many of us are driven low key by our haters. However you want to, however you want to, you know. Yeah. Like the people who doubted you. And I'll say I certainly have been. You bet. That is also the fuel of hero movies, you know, is like the person who like fucked with you as a kid or the person who bullied you,
[00:44:52.480] 然后就会想，我该如何向那个地区的其他人证明，我和他们一样成功，一样有成就呢？这太真实了。我们很多人都是被那些诋毁我们的人暗中激励着前进的。不管你想怎么做，不管你想怎么做，你知道的。是的。就像那些曾经质疑你的人。我承认，我肯定经历过。没错。这也是英雄电影的动力，你知道，就像小时候欺负过你的人，或者霸凌过你的人一样。
[00:45:21.540] the person who tormented your self-concept. It's the gratification of I will show them. And I've had a few opportunities where I could have showed them or I did show them. And guess what? Did not heal me forever. Did not make me feel suddenly a winner in every facet of my life. The thing is, they didn't care then. And I'm sorry. They still don't care now. You know, you've been living for them again for someone other than yourself. And it's a losing game.
[00:45:21.540] 那个曾经折磨你、打击你自尊的人。你渴望的是“我要让他们看看”。我曾经有过几次机会可以让他们看看，或者说，我确实让他们看看。但你猜怎么着？这并没有让我彻底痊愈。也没有让我突然觉得自己人生各个方面都赢了。问题是，他们当时根本不在乎。我很抱歉。他们现在依然不在乎。你知道吗，你又一次为了他们，为了别人，而不是为了你自己而活。这是一场注定失败的游戏。
[00:45:50.820] But a tempting one. Damn, I'm trying to think now. Is there a world where you have these ambitions and like these things that you're striving for? And you are maybe using some of that negative energy to drive you. But at the same time, you're not telling yourself you're doing this because you're worthless. You're not like whipping yourself in the back. How do you balance your ambitions and what you want for yourself in life? But with self-love as well. Yeah, I don't know.
[00:45:50.820] 但这的确很诱人。该死，我现在正在努力思考。是否存在这样一个世界：你拥有这些抱负，喜欢你所追求的事物？你或许会利用一些负面能量来激励自己。但与此同时，你不会告诉自己这样做是因为你一文不值。你不会像鞭子一样抽打自己。你该如何平衡你的抱负和你对人生的渴望？同时又要懂得爱自己。是啊，我不知道。
[00:46:16.660] The reason why I laughed inappropriately at that was because I don't know if you guys have seen the Da Vinci Code. But there's this like gnarly albino dude who like flagellates himself with a chain or something and something horrific. And I just the way the language we use, I just thought that's what I'm doing every day to achieve. I'm not. Yeah, I think my response to that is obviously I am still figuring it out just like the rest of us.
[00:46:16.660] 我之所以会不合时宜地笑出来，是因为我不知道你们有没有看过《达芬奇密码》。里面有个很可怕的白化病患者，用链子之类的东西鞭打自己，非常恐怖。我当时就觉得，我们用的语言方式，让我想到我每天努力的目标就是达到那种境界。但我并没有。是的，我觉得我的回应很明显，我和其他人一样，还在摸索中。
[00:46:39.620] Because I think like the paradox that I try to explore in my podcast, in my content is it's ambitious minds seeking peace and self-love on the path to fulfilling their dreams. And actually those are like sometimes diametrically opposed things. To be ambitious is to be future gazing. But to be self-loving and peaceful is to be in the now. And to be ambitious is to like care about external validation and external markers of success. Or maybe it is for you.
[00:46:39.620] 因为我觉得，就像我在播客和内容中试图探讨的悖论一样，那就是雄心勃勃的人们在实现梦想的道路上寻求内心的平静和自我关爱。而实际上，这两者有时似乎是截然相反的。雄心勃勃意味着展望未来，而自我关爱和内心的平静则意味着活在当下。雄心勃勃也意味着在意外界的认可和成功的外在标志。或许对你来说确实如此。
[00:47:07.380] But peace and self-love is no, no. All that matters is what I think and what I feel. And so for me, I'm always going to default live in the unhealthy ambitious part of this whatever Venn diagram, if you will. I'm always living there. And the fear is that if I completely, you know, lose myself in self-love and peace and I just become Eckhart Tolle. I don't know if you know who that is, but he's like the paragon of egoless existence in the Oprah circles.
[00:47:07.380] 但和平与自爱对我来说，绝对不行。我唯一在乎的是我的想法和感受。所以对我来说，我总是默认地生活在这个维恩图里不健康的、充满野心的那一部分。我总是活在那里。我害怕的是，如果我完全沉溺于自爱与和平，变成埃克哈特·托利那样的人——我不知道你是否认识他，但在奥普拉的圈子里，他简直就是无我存在的典范。
[00:47:35.760] And like to me, I'm like, I don't want to be Eckhart Tolle because to me that's God bless him. It's like living like a rock. Like I'm having no response. I'm not having any highs. I'm also not having any lows. To me, that's like a muted. This is again, just my opinion. A muted existence. I have dreams. I want to accomplish them. Don't I deserve that feeling? To me, it's because I'm always going to over index on the side of like more ambitious, more toxically driven by these like negative self-talk things.
[00:47:35.760] 对我来说，我不想成为埃克哈特·托利那样的人，因为我觉得他很了不起。那样就像一块石头，毫无反应，既没有喜悦也没有悲伤。对我来说，那是一种麻木的状态。这只是我个人的看法。一种麻木的存在。我有梦想，我想实现它们。难道我不应该拥有那种感觉吗？我觉得，这是因为我总是过于执着于追求更高的目标，被那些消极的自我对话所驱使。
[00:48:05.120] Cultivating balance in my life is always going to be going in the further direction of when I've fallen off the wagon, when I've lost control of my narrative. How can I call in more of this self-compassion, more of this grace, more of this kindness, more of this for me, spirituality, which is just to say like an energy or a power beyond myself and my ego and my controlled environment to find some sense of peace. It has really helped. It's been fundamental at every step of the journey.
[00:48:05.120] 在我的生活中，保持平衡总是意味着要不断超越自我，超越失控的时刻。我该如何唤起更多的自我关怀、更多的宽容、更多的善意，以及更多的灵性——也就是超越自我、超越自我意识和所掌控的环境的能量或力量，从而找到内心的平静？这真的很有帮助。它贯穿了我人生旅程的每一步，都至关重要。
[00:48:30.880] And the more I deeply believe some of these things, which is that I am happiest when I'm living in accordance with my true value system, like I mentioned, that I require connection and inspiration and significance in order to be okay. The truth is I'll never not be ambitious. So that's not going anywhere. The truth is we live in a capitalistic, money-driven world. It matters what you own. It matters what your resume looks like. We can't ignore these things.
[00:48:30.880] 我越发深信这些，比如，当我按照自己真正的价值观生活时，我才会感到最快乐；就像我之前提到的，我需要与他人建立联系、获得启发和找到人生意义才能感到满足。事实上，我永远不会放弃雄心壮志，这一点不会改变。我们生活在一个资本主义的、金钱至上的世界，你拥有什么很重要，你的简历如何也很重要。我们不能忽视这些。
[00:49:00.880] But, you know, how can we call in what is needed based off of where we're at, based off of how sucked in we've been into culture, into the narratives that we should be doing all these things? Like that to me is the paradox. It's the contradiction. It's the tension of like you want both. So to have both, you need to be doing a tightrope walk on some level, but you can.
[00:49:00.880] 但是，你知道，我们如何才能根据我们所处的境地，根据我们被文化和各种叙事所裹挟的程度，来召唤真正需要的东西呢？对我来说，这就是悖论。这就是矛盾。这就是你想要两者兼得的矛盾张力。所以，要两者兼得，你在某种程度上需要走钢丝，但你确实可以做到。
[00:49:24.840] People are with you wanting to do that because we're getting in a world that has become, I think, increasingly obsessed with the achievement and the rat race and is seeing the consequences of those actions and doesn't want to live with them. I feel like Gen Z, right? Our girl Greta Thunberg. We're living in a world that is increasingly interested in being in the now, not forsaking our mental health until we reach some kind of benchmark.
[00:49:24.840] 人们支持你这样做，因为我们正身处一个越来越痴迷于成就和无休止竞争的世界，他们看到了这些行为的后果，却不愿承担。我感觉自己就像Z世代，对吧？就像我们的格蕾塔·通贝里一样。我们生活在一个越来越注重活在当下，而不是为了达到某种目标而牺牲心理健康的世界。
[00:49:48.700] As scary as the world may seem, we have never lived in an environment that has more resources and more community and more people who want to join you and help you in that balance. That's so true. We're like way more connected nowadays. The internet is at an all time high. I can call it that. But there's like communities everywhere. And at the click of a button, you can talk to someone halfway around the world. I don't know, just like our parents' generation.
[00:49:48.700] 世界或许令人恐惧，但我们从未生活在一个拥有如此丰富资源、如此紧密联系、如此多人愿意加入我们、帮助我们维持平衡的环境中。的确如此。如今我们之间的联系比以往任何时候都更加紧密。互联网正处于前所未有的高度。我可以这么说。社区无处不在。只需点击一下按钮，你就能与远在世界另一端的人交谈。我不知道，就像我们父母那一代一样。
[00:50:16.560] They had to send snail mail and that would take probably a month or something. Yep. I wonder though, maybe to like satisfy the ambitious side of ourselves, we instead of focusing so much on purely hitting marks, we can challenge ourselves to be like, how many rest days can I fit in here while also hitting this mark? And that is like the monthly challenge. You're like min-maxing your mental health.
[00:50:16.560] 他们得寄慢邮件，那可能得花一个月左右。没错。不过我在想，或许为了满足我们内心的雄心壮志，我们与其只关注完成目标，不如挑战一下自己，比如，在完成目标的前提下，我能安排多少休息日？这就像是每月的挑战。你这是在优化你的心理健康。
[00:50:46.020] I know. I live for a challenge like that and again, for better and for worse. But it's yeah, I think like in my burnout and the addiction to working, you have to radically accept that rest is a task. Rest is a responsibility you owe yourself. And I mean, if this motivates you, it's like you will actually be more productive if you rest. But, you know, also fuck that. You should just be resting for the joy of your life and the wellness of your spirit. Yeah.
[00:50:46.020] 我知道。我就是为了这样的挑战而活，而且无论好坏。但是，我觉得就像我之前经历的职业倦怠和工作成瘾一样，你必须彻底接受休息也是一种任务。休息是你对自己应尽的责任。我的意思是，如果这能激励你，那么休息确实能让你更高效。但是，你知道，也别太在意这些。你应该为了享受生活和保持精神健康而休息。没错。
[00:51:14.320] I keep imagining your, I think it was IFS, internal family system thing that you mentioned earlier. And I just have this image of yelling at all the other people in your system, going back in and then all the other people being like, damn, he's such a hard ass. You know, it's like very corporate. But I do think that's very valid. And to me, it's kind of a healing way to look at it because it's so much more emotionally hard to think of myself as one like person.
[00:51:14.320] 我一直在想象你之前提到的，好像是IFS（内在家庭系统）疗法。我脑海里浮现出这样的画面：你对着系统里的其他人大吼大叫，然后回到系统里，其他人会说：“天哪，他真是个混蛋。” 你知道，这听起来很像企业里的那种思维模式。但我确实觉得这种想法很有道理。对我来说，这是一种疗愈的视角，因为把自己看作一个单一的人，在情感上真的很难接受。
[00:51:43.920] Then if I succeed and have a good day, it's me having a good day. If I do poorly, all of me is having a bad day. Yeah. But if I kind of break it out and compartmentalize, like maybe the ambitious side of me is unhappy today. But the healing side, the social side, like all these other things could be fulfilled. So maybe it's about like breaking down that pie chart and, you know, seeing ups and downs in like each section instead of combining all of it into like one up and down. Totally.
[00:51:43.920] 如果我成功了，度过了美好的一天，那就是我今天过得很好。如果我表现不佳，那就是我整个人都过得很糟糕。没错。但如果我把它拆开来，进行分类，比如，也许我雄心勃勃的一面今天不开心，但我的疗愈一面、社交一面，以及其他所有方面都能得到满足。所以，也许关键在于把这个饼图拆开，看看每个部分都有起伏，而不是把所有事情混为一谈，只看到一个整体的起伏。完全正确。
[00:52:13.660] And then asking yourself which part is running the show right now or has been running the show for years. For me, I wasn't cognizant of the fact that Drill Sergeant was one part. I was like, that's all I am. And that did not lead to happiness and success on a deeper level. You know, it's like just just acknowledging that there is a part within you that is always calm and confident and sure of themselves and able to extend kindness. It's kind of like a revelation, you know? Right.
[00:52:13.660] 然后问问自己，现在主导一切的究竟是哪一部分，或者说，是哪一部分多年来一直主导着一切。对我来说，我以前并没有意识到“严厉教官”只是我的一部分。我当时觉得，这就是我的全部。而这并没有让我获得更深层次的快乐和成功。你知道，这就像承认你内心深处始终存在着一个平静、自信、笃定，并且能够给予他人善意的部分。这就像是一种顿悟，你知道吗？没错。
[00:52:38.740] I really like your point, Lindsay, as well about you can't just also go all in on one part. You know, if you become the all peaceful, all self-loving, but then you're not doing anything else. That's also hurting yourself in some ways because, as you said, like we're in a capitalistic society and we still have to be somewhat productive to survive in this world. Yeah, you've got to live somewhere, you know? Pay those bills.
[00:52:38.740] 琳赛，我非常赞同你的观点，你不能只专注于某一方面。你知道，如果你变得完全平和、完全自爱，却什么都不做，那在某种程度上也会伤害自己。正如你所说，我们生活在资本主义社会，为了在这个世界上生存，我们仍然需要有所作为。是啊，你得有个地方住，对吧？得付账单。
[00:53:04.580] So it really is a pretty big challenge to find this balance. There's never going to be an, you know, an end-all be-all answer to this. Everyone is so different and it's kind of just figuring out what balance on the scale is going to work for you individually. And unfortunately, that means a lot of self-reflection and a lot of work. Yes. When maybe some people would much rather put that energy into other work.
[00:53:04.580] 所以，找到这种平衡确实是个很大的挑战。这个问题永远不会有万能的答案。每个人都如此不同，关键在于找到适合自己的平衡点。不幸的是，这意味着大量的自我反省和努力。是的。而有些人可能更愿意把这些精力投入到其他工作中。
[00:53:31.020] I think like the older we get, though, the more obvious it gets because, you know, when we're younger, we're driven by that youthful energy and like invincibility. You could like have all-nighters and still pop back up totally fine. But now it's like, okay, no matter how you spin it, you cannot deny that the body grows old and things change. What are you talking about, Crystal? That's not going to happen to me. Yeah, right.
[00:53:31.020] 我觉得年纪越大，这种感觉就越明显。你知道，年轻的时候，我们精力充沛，觉得自己无所不能。你可以熬夜，然后第二天醒来依然精神抖擞。但现在，不管你怎么辩解，你都无法否认身体会衰老，一切都会改变。你在说什么呢，克丽丝塔尔？这种事不会发生在我身上。是啊，没错。
[00:53:58.340] I definitely still do whatever I want, right? But it's inevitable and you have to like learn to adapt. And maybe it's almost acceptable in that sense to a certain degree that you just go full in on that hustle culture when you're younger. But then as you get older, you're like, you know, I really need to reprioritize and figure out what this all means.
[00:53:58.340] 我当然还是会随心所欲，对吧？但这不可避免，你必须学会适应。从某种程度上来说，年轻的时候全身心投入那种拼搏文化或许是可以接受的。但随着年龄增长，你会想，我真的需要重新审视自己的优先事项，弄清楚这一切的意义所在。
[00:54:19.360] For sure. I've heard Brene Brown talk about how like on a sociological level that the 20s and 30s are the era for acquiring. You are acquiring property, acquiring net worth, acquiring a family. And then usually it's like the 40s and 50s come. You reach the top of your corporate ladder. You get the family unit in order. And then usually that's when people have their midlife crisis because they realize it's not enough. They've been living in the same pattern.
[00:54:19.360] 当然。我听布琳·布朗说过，从社会学的角度来看，二三十岁是积累财富的时期。你会购置房产，积累财富，组建家庭。然后通常到了四五十岁，你会攀上事业的顶峰，家庭也步入正轨。这时，人们往往会经历中年危机，因为他们意识到这一切还不够。他们一直生活在同样的模式中。
[00:54:46.640] And if you're lucky to live this long, hopefully you can do this before you get to that midlife crisis. You get to like the era where you are cultivating meaning. Usually this is where people become philanthropic. They give back. They connect through community. They start a podcast. They write a book. Whatever it may be. Because they realize like that this spinning their wheels on this treadmill isn't actually working for them. And so even though I knew that in my early 20s, I was still like, that's cool. But I'm definitely going to abide by that. Like I'm going to.
[00:54:46.640] 如果你有幸活到这个年纪，希望你能在中年危机到来之前做到这一点。你会进入一个追求人生意义的阶段。通常，人们会在这个时候开始热衷慈善，回馈社会，融入社群，开办播客，写书，或者做各种各样的事情。因为他们意识到，在这种原地打转、疲于奔命的状态对他们来说毫无益处。所以，即使我在二十出头的时候就明白这一点，我当时还是觉得，这很棒。但我肯定会遵循这个原则，我一定会做到。
[00:55:15.920] I don't plan. I don't plan on it anymore. But I did spend a majority of my 20s just obsessed with the acquisition of my success. And then reality starts to set in. Then you have a crisis and you realize you're not well. And you've got to be turned upside down and start figuring out how you can live for the right reasons. Well, now I'm just stuck with that metaphor of imagining ourselves as like a corporation. And I'm like, do I need to call HR on myself? Like, where's my CFO?
[00:55:15.920] 我不做计划。我不再做计划了。但我二十多岁的时候，大部分时间都一心想着如何获得成功。然后现实开始袭来。然后你会遇到危机，意识到自己状态不好。你必须彻底改变，开始思考如何才能为了正确的理由而活。现在，我脑子里一直萦绕着一个比喻：我们就像一家公司。我心想，我需要找人事部门谈谈自己吗？我的首席财务官在哪儿？
[00:55:45.780] You might. But it has been so rewarding to sit here and talk to you both of you ladies. Because it makes me feel so normal. I can't believe all of this stuff that I've been battling with. All the demons I've been fighting. This is just a part of this life stage, I think. So thank you both for sitting down and really opening up about negative self-talk and balancing ambition with self-love.
[00:55:45.780] 也许吧。但能坐在这里和你们两位女士聊天真的很有意义。因为这让我感觉自己很正常。我简直不敢相信自己一直在和这么多事情作斗争，一直在与心魔搏斗。我想，这只是人生这个阶段的一部分。所以，谢谢你们坐下来，坦诚地谈论消极的自我对话，以及如何在抱负和自爱之间找到平衡。
