[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. So before we get into today's topic, I have a funny story to share. So this past weekend, I went on a trip up to Napa. I found out that there is a Hooters. Oh.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。在进入今天的话题之前，我想先分享一个趣事。上周末，我去纳帕谷旅行。我发现那里居然有一家Hooters餐厅。哦。
[00:00:33.970] Up near that area. And it's actually the last Hooters of NorCal. Like all the other Hooters shut down in NorCal, but there's still like a decent amount in SoCal. And the thing is,
[00:00:33.970] 就在那附近。而且它实际上是北加州最后一家Hooters了。北加州其他的Hooters都关门了，但南加州还有不少。问题是，
[00:00:48.290] where I used to live growing up back in Canada, there was a Hooters really close to my home. So I remember we would always like drive by it and I was like, oh my god, like what's Hooters? And we've never been, right? Right.
[00:00:48.290] 我小时候在加拿大住的地方，离我家很近就有一家猫头鹰餐厅（Hooters）。我记得我们每次开车路过那里，我都会想，天哪，猫头鹰餐厅是什么？我们从来没去过，对吧？对。
[00:01:03.250] So on this trip up to Napa, I was like, ooh, is it crazy if we go to Hooters? Because I've always wanted to see what it's like inside. Oh my god.
[00:01:03.250] 所以这次去纳帕的路上，我就想，哎呀，如果我们去Hooters餐厅会不会太疯狂？因为我一直想看看里面是什么样子。我的天哪。
[00:01:16.290] So on our way back down, back to the bay, we stopped by Hooters and we went in and we had some wings and we watched some football. Hey, to be fair, I heard the wings at Hooters are really good. Okay, I can confirm the wings, quite good.
[00:01:16.290] 所以回海湾的路上，我们顺道去了Hooters，进去吃了些鸡翅，还看了会儿橄榄球赛。说实话，我听说Hooters的鸡翅真的很好吃。好吧，我可以证实，鸡翅确实不错。
[00:01:33.410] We were eating them and we're like, oh dude, these wings, they're pretty good. Oh my god. Also, it was kind of cool because there were like so many TVs inside. I'm trying to remember, like, I think another popular wings joint for game watching is B-dubs
[00:01:33.410] 我们当时一边吃一边说，哇，这鸡翅真好吃！我的天！而且，里面好多电视也挺酷的。我努力回想，好像还有一家很受欢迎的看球赛的鸡翅店叫B-dubs。
[00:01:53.010] or their full name Buffalo Wild Wings. And I remember they have like a Jumbotron at the bar area and they do have a decent amount of TVs. But maybe it's like the way that this Hooters was laid out.
[00:01:53.010] 或者他们的全名是 Buffalo Wild Wings。我记得他们吧台区有个巨型电子屏幕，而且电视也不少。但也许跟这家 Hooters 的布局差不多。
[00:02:04.850] It's just like TVs all around the wall and it's a regular rectangle shape of the building. So you just feel like you're surrounded by TVs. Yeah, and there's like some hanging in the middle as well. So there's just a bunch and they're playing every single football game.
[00:02:04.850] 就像整面墙都是电视，而且这栋楼是标准的矩形。所以你会感觉自己被电视包围了。是啊，中间也挂着一些。总之就是好多电视，每场足球比赛都在播。
[00:02:22.210] It was a Sunday. And instead of playing music like a lot of bars or sports bars do, they're actually playing the audio from one of the games, which was pretty interesting. But yeah, it was a very interesting experience. So when we first went in there, I was like,
[00:02:22.210] 那天是星期天。和其他很多酒吧或体育酒吧不同，他们没有放音乐，而是播放比赛的音频，这挺有意思的。没错，这是一次非常有趣的体验。所以当我们刚进去的时候，我就想，
[00:02:43.410] oh, I'm like the only girl in this establishment, like as a customer. But then as time went on and like the more hype football games were starting, a lot of people started trickling in. And actually a decent amount of families were coming in. Oh my god.
[00:02:43.410] 哦，我好像是这家店里唯一的女生，就是顾客。但随着时间推移，尤其是足球比赛越来越精彩的时候，人开始陆续进来。而且还有不少家庭也来了。我的天哪。
[00:03:02.850] So that was like kind of a funny, surprising thing. The place definitely filled up and they're like quite busy. I was like, wow, it's a shame that they all shut down in NorCal. Dude, actually, now that you mention it,
[00:03:02.850] 所以这事儿挺搞笑也挺出乎意料的。那地方肯定爆满了，生意特别好。我就想，哇，北加州的店都关门了，真是太可惜了。哥们儿，你这么一说，确实……
[00:03:15.170] I remember me and James were having this conversation with my friend Nat and her boyfriend and me and Nat were like really wanting to go to Hooters because you hear all this hype about it. And maybe it's just more comfortable for like women to confess
[00:03:15.170] 我记得当时我和詹姆斯正跟我朋友娜特和她男朋友聊天，我和娜特特别想去猫头鹰餐厅（Hooters），因为听说那里很火。也许对女生来说，在那里更容易坦白吧。
[00:03:28.530] that they wanted to go to Hooters than like men to do it. But we're like, oh my god, like we should take a day and go. And then we looked it up and the only one in the bay, like you said, was like super North.
[00:03:28.530] 他们说他们想去猫头鹰餐厅，而不是像男人那样。但我们当时就想，我的天哪，我们应该抽出一天时间去。然后我们查了一下，就像你说的，湾区唯一一家猫头鹰餐厅在非常北的地方。
[00:03:41.010] So we were just like, damn, that's like kind of a trip. Maybe one day, but you fulfilled our dreams. Dude, I should have brought you guys. I mean, I will admit, like truly the women who work there at Hooters,
[00:03:41.010] 所以我们就觉得，哇，这简直太不可思议了。也许有一天我们会去，但你帮我们实现了梦想。兄弟，我真应该带你们去的。我是说，我得承认，像Hooters餐厅的那些女服务员们，
[00:03:55.010] they have to wear like these super tight tank tops and like really short booty shorts. And I was like, oh my god, I can't look at them like below their neck. I just I feel like so rude if I were to. Making extreme eye contact. Oh my god.
[00:03:55.010] 她们必须穿那种超级紧身的背心和超短热裤。我当时就想，天哪，我都没办法盯着她们脖子以下看。我觉得那样太没礼貌了。眼神对视太过分了。天哪。
[00:04:12.850] Well, didn't you once say the term like elevator eyes or something? You're trying to keep the elevator on the penthouse. Oh yeah, exactly. Oh man. Actually, that's kind of hilarious because I was just in Texas with my family and James.
[00:04:12.850] 嗯，你之前是不是说过“电梯眼”之类的词？你这是想让电梯停在顶层公寓吗？哦，对，没错。哎呀。说起来还挺搞笑的，因为我刚和家人还有詹姆斯在德克萨斯州待过。
[00:04:32.210] We are going to like some sort of steakhouse. We were going to eat lunch somewhere and we were driving by like this barbecue place that me and James had gone to without my parents. So we were like, oh, like that's the barbecue place that we were at.
[00:04:32.210] 我们打算去一家牛排馆之类的。我们本来打算找个地方吃午饭，结果开车路过一家烧烤店，我和詹姆斯之前没带我爸妈去过那里。所以我们就想，哦，原来这就是我们之前去的那家烧烤店。
[00:04:45.410] It was really good. And my mom looks over and basically it was just like the barbecue place. And then right next to it was Hooters. But the Hooters like logo and everything is like really bright orange.
[00:04:45.410] 真的很好吃。我妈往旁边看了一眼，基本上就是一家烧烤店。旁边就是Hooters餐厅。但是Hooters的标志什么的都是亮橙色的。
[00:04:54.930] Yeah, I guess she just immediately was like, oh, like did you guys go to Hooters? And my dad was like, no, no. Your dad is like, please tell me they weren't at Hooters. Yeah, exactly. Like just lie to my face. But yeah, it was a pretty interesting experience.
[00:04:54.930] 是啊，我猜她当时就直接问，哦，你们是不是去猫头鹰餐厅了？我爸就说，没有没有。你爸肯定说，求你告诉我他们没去猫头鹰餐厅。对，就是这样。就当面撒谎。不过，这倒是挺有意思的经历。
[00:05:12.290] And my takeaway is that Hooters does indeed have solid wings. All right. It's crystal verified. Hooters wings are bomb. But speaking of Dallas, I'm going to go ahead and say that I'm not a big fan of Dallas. Do you?
[00:05:12.290] 我的结论是，Hooters的鸡翅确实很棒。没错，这绝对没问题。Hooters的鸡翅好吃到爆。不过说到达拉斯，我得先声明，我不太喜欢达拉斯。你喜欢吗？
[00:05:29.170] But speaking of Dallas, I also have a somewhat funny story. And low key, this might be one of those funny stories that are like only funny to me because it was kind of a weird situation. But, you know, I'll try my best to tell it.
[00:05:29.170] 说到达拉斯，我也有个挺有意思的故事。不过说实话，这可能只是个只有我自己觉得好笑的故事，因为当时的情况有点儿怪。但不管怎样，我会尽力把它讲完。
[00:05:44.930] Today, this morning, James and I flew back from Dallas to SJC and we took a pretty early morning flight. So the flight left at 9 a.m. CST, which means we had to like get up at 7 and leave the house by 7 to get to the airport, etc., etc.
[00:05:44.930] 今天早上，我和詹姆斯从达拉斯飞回圣何塞，我们坐的是很早的航班。航班是中部时间早上9点起飞，这意味着我们得7点起床，7点前出门去机场等等。
[00:06:01.970] So as you can imagine, we were somewhat tired when we got on the flight. And usually after takeoff, when we're at the appropriate height or whatever the plane like, you know how they come around and start serving drinks? Right, right.
[00:06:01.970] 所以你可以想象，我们登机的时候都有些疲惫。通常起飞后，当飞机达到合适的高度或者其他什么高度时，你知道他们会过来提供饮料吗？对，对。
[00:06:14.290] But this was a really small plane, so they didn't push the like drink cart down. It was more of like they would go and ask everyone what they wanted and then they would come back with a tray of drinks and serve it out to people.
[00:06:14.290] 但这架飞机真的很小，所以他们没有推着饮料车下来。而是他们会去问每个人想要什么，然后端着一托盘饮料回来给大家送上。
[00:06:25.330] But I think basically James and I were like knocked out during the ordering part. So when we woke up and we were looking around, everyone was getting like handed drinks. So I was in the window seat and then James was in the middle seat.
[00:06:25.330] 但我觉得我和詹姆斯基本上是在点餐的时候就睡着了。所以当我们醒来环顾四周时，发现每个人都在领饮料。我坐在靠窗的座位上，詹姆斯坐在中间的座位上。
[00:06:38.530] So I was like, oh, James, like can you flag someone down and see if we can order a drink? So he was like, OK, sure. And then this flight attendant was walking by and he flags her down.
[00:06:38.530] 于是我就说，詹姆斯，你能拦下一个人看看能不能帮我们点杯饮料吗？他答应了，好的。然后正好有个空姐走过来，他就拦下了她。
[00:06:47.490] And he's like, oh, can we get like a coffee and a ginger ale, please? And then she like gave him a really dirty look. I don't know why. I think it could be because he had like AirPod, like the noise cancelling AirPods on.
[00:06:47.490] 然后他就说，哦，我们能来杯咖啡和姜汁汽水吗？然后她狠狠地瞪了他一眼。我不知道为什么。我觉得可能是因为他戴着AirPods，那种降噪耳机。
[00:06:59.730] So maybe he was talking like more loud than usual or something. But she just like shot him like the dirtiest side eye ever and then walked away. James looks back at me and we start like laughing because we were like, what the hell just happened? Yeah.
[00:06:59.730] 所以，也许他说话的声音比平时大一些。但她只是狠狠地瞪了他一眼，然后就走开了。詹姆斯回头看着我，我们俩都笑了起来，因为我们都懵了，刚才到底发生了什么？是啊。
[00:07:12.130] And then literally like five seconds later, a different flight attendant comes by and then she's like, hey, like, you know, you guys didn't order any drinks when you guys were sleeping. So like, do you want a drink?
[00:07:12.130] 然后大概过了五秒钟，另一位空乘人员走过来，说：“嘿，你们睡觉的时候好像没点饮料。所以，你们想喝点什么吗？”
[00:07:25.730] And I don't know why, but we like repeated our order again. So he was like, oh, yeah, like can I get a coffee? And I was like, oh, and I'll have a ginger ale. Like, thanks so much. And then she walks away.
[00:07:25.730] 我也不知道为什么，我们好像又重复了一遍订单。然后他就说：“哦，对，能给我来杯咖啡吗？”我说：“哦，我还来杯姜汁汽水。”然后她就走开了。
[00:07:35.330] So she comes back with the drinks and hands us a coffee and a ginger ale. And then the first lady who like gave us like a dirty side eye came back and handed us the same drinks and gave us another weird look.
[00:07:35.330] 于是她端着饮料回来了，递给我们一杯咖啡和一杯姜汁汽水。然后之前那个用那种不屑的眼神瞥了我们一眼的女士又回来了，递给我们同样的饮料，还用一种奇怪的眼神看着我们。
[00:07:48.370] Because she's like, why the fuck do you guys have two of the same drinks? And I did not want a coffee and James did not want a ginger ale. So now I'm just like, oh my God, like we're so stupid. I don't know why we ordered twice.
[00:07:48.370] 因为她当时就问，你们俩干嘛点两杯一样的饮料？我不想喝咖啡，詹姆斯也不想喝姜汁汽水。所以我现在就想，我的天哪，我们真是太蠢了。我也不知道我们为什么要点两份。
[00:07:59.890] But I got into like a huge laughing fit where I was shaking violently from laughing and like literally crying tears from laughing so hard. But yeah, I was just like, am I delirious or was that weird? Wait, that was definitely weird.
[00:07:59.890] 但我突然就笑得停不下来，浑身颤抖，笑到眼泪都出来了。当时我就想，我是不是神志不清了？还是说这很奇怪？等等，这绝对是很奇怪。
[00:08:16.450] I feel like if anything, it almost feels like the first person might have sent the second person. Maybe she's shot the dirty look because she was like, oh, that's not my job. Someone's about to come around and ask you. But then she came back with the drinks anyway.
[00:08:16.450] 我觉得，如果真有什么事的话，那很可能是第一个人指使第二个人。也许她瞪了第二个人一眼，心想：哦，这不是我的事。马上会有人过来问你的。但后来她还是端着饮料回来了。
[00:08:31.970] Yeah, and I felt like it was kind of like a message where she didn't want to do it. And like you said, I did somewhat think that she sent the next lady or she knew like,
[00:08:31.970] 是啊，我觉得这就像是在暗示她不想做这件事。就像你说的，我也有点怀疑她是不是派了下一个女士过来，或者她知道……
[00:08:41.810] oh, this other lady is going to come around and ask everyone for drinks anyway. So I'll just wait and have her do it. And also, I didn't know that James had asked for our drinks or I didn't know he was like, oh, can I get these two drinks?
[00:08:41.810] 哦，反正那位女士也会过来问大家要饮料。所以我就等着让她来吧。还有，我不知道詹姆斯问过我们要饮料，也不知道他当时说的是“哦，我可以要这两杯饮料吗？”
[00:08:53.650] I thought he was just like, oh, can we like order some drinks? And then she did the dirty look and walked away. So yeah, I just have to like chug a coffee and a ginger ale. I'm also imagining like the awkward moment when, you know,
[00:08:53.650] 我当时以为他只是想问，哦，我们能点些饮料吗？然后她狠狠地瞪了我一眼就走开了。所以，我只能硬着头皮喝杯咖啡和姜汁汽水了。我还在想象那种尴尬的场景，你知道的，
[00:09:07.970] the first person comes by, drops off the drinks for you. And the other person is just behind her, like looking at her hands, like what the fuck is happening? Yeah, exactly. Oh my god, it was really cringe actually. Okay, don't think too hard about it.
[00:09:07.970] 第一个人过来，把饮料放下。另一个人就站在她身后，看着她的手，一脸懵逼，好像在问：这他妈到底是怎么回事？对，没错。我的天，当时真的尴尬死了。好吧，别想太多了。
[00:09:27.250] You're off that plane now. You'll never see them again. I'm like adding this to the list of things that keep me up at night. All right. Well, thank you for sharing your hectic story of the weekend.
[00:09:27.250] 你现在已经下了飞机，再也见不到他们了。我感觉又多了一件让我夜不能寐的事。好吧，谢谢你分享你这个忙碌的周末经历。
[00:09:42.050] Now let's move on to the topic at hand, which I guess isn't too related to our stories. But I kind of wanted us to talk about our general feelings about like, are we a kid still? Are we an adult?
[00:09:42.050] 现在我们来谈谈正题，虽然我觉得这跟我们讲的故事关系不大。但我还是想跟大家聊聊我们各自的感受，比如，我们还是孩子吗？还是已经长大了？
[00:09:56.770] Are we just like faking it till we make it in society right now? I feel like I personally sometimes maybe more often than not feel like a kid still. So I wanted to ask if there's ever like moments or things that make you still feel like a kid.
[00:09:56.770] 我们现在是不是都在假装成功，直到真正成功为止？我个人感觉，我常常觉得自己还是个孩子。所以我想问问，有没有什么时刻或事情会让你觉得自己还是个孩子？
[00:10:16.530] Ooh, actually, I would say this is somewhat topical because I was just with my parents for about 10 days. And I think always just being back at home with my parents makes me feel the most like a kid.
[00:10:16.530] 哦，其实我觉得这挺应景的，因为我刚和父母待了大概十天。我觉得和父母待在家里最能让我感觉自己像个孩子。
[00:10:29.810] For one, I don't have to do like housework and chores and clean. Although I'm a horrible daughter for not helping out as much as I should. But also, I think it's just the default position that you take when you're with your parents,
[00:10:29.810] 首先，我不用做家务、杂事和打扫卫生。虽然我没能尽到应尽的责任，是个不称职的女儿。但我觉得，这只是和父母在一起时自然而然会采取的姿态。
[00:10:42.930] because there's such a clear and distinct hierarchy there. Whereas in like the professional world, your older manager isn't necessarily like your father, you know? Right, right. So then I think that's probably when I feel the most childlike. But I think it manifests in like funky way sometimes.
[00:10:42.930] 因为那里等级制度非常清晰明确。但在职场上，你的老上司未必像你的父亲，你知道吗？对，对。所以我觉得那时候我可能最像个孩子。但我觉得有时候这种感觉会以一种很奇怪的方式表现出来。
[00:11:01.010] I was kind of thinking about it actually, where I feel like I get a little bratty when I go and visit my parents because I almost feel, I don't want to say entitled, but I almost feel like, oh, this is the only time I can be a kid.
[00:11:01.010] 我其实一直在想这个问题，我觉得自己每次去看望父母的时候都会变得有点任性，因为我感觉，我不想说自己有特权，但我感觉，哦，这是我唯一可以做孩子的时候。
[00:11:16.050] So I'm gonna use it to my full advantage and be as childlike as I can sort of. And I'm obviously not actively thinking this, but looking back at my behavior, I feel like this was like the stance that I took somehow. Yeah.
[00:11:16.050] 所以我要充分利用这一点，尽可能地像个孩子一样。当然，我并不是刻意这么想的，但回想我的行为，我觉得我当时好像就是这么想的。是的。
[00:11:29.170] So it does manifest in like a weird way sometimes. You're kind of just like subconsciously reverting back to the like, oh my god, nice, I'm the center of my parents' universe. Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:29.170] 所以有时候它会以一种很奇怪的方式表现出来。你会下意识地回到那种状态，比如，天哪，太好了，我是父母世界的中心。对，没错。
[00:11:43.890] And they enable it too, because we only get a couple of days together like in a year or so. Right. I feel like that totally makes sense. Yeah, I guess I sometimes wonder, because that's definitely logically like the most
[00:11:43.890] 他们也促成了这件事，因为我们一年左右也就只能聚几天。没错。我觉得这完全说得通。是啊，我有时候也会想，因为这绝对是最合乎逻辑的。
[00:11:56.450] sensible or like common maybe time to feel like a kid when you're with your parents. And since I am still living at home with my parents, I wonder like, oh, maybe because I'm with them, even if I don't consciously think it,
[00:11:56.450] 理智上，或者像平常一样，也许和父母在一起的时候会感觉自己像个孩子。因为我现在还和父母住在一起，所以我会想，哦，也许是因为和他们在一起，即使我没有意识到这一点，
[00:12:13.650] it just like leaks into my life subconsciously. But I feel like even in the workplace, I feel it sometimes where I just feel young. And then because I feel young, I feel like a kid or like maybe I still feel really green at work, green as in new.
[00:12:13.650] 它就像潜移默化地渗入我的生活。我感觉即使在工作中，有时也会有这种感觉，觉得自己很年轻。正因为感觉年轻，我又觉得自己像个孩子，或者说，在工作中仍然很稚嫩，稚嫩指的是一切都是新的。
[00:12:31.810] But when I think about it and when I sit down and think, I'm like, oh, well, actually, I've been working at this company for almost four years or I've been in the workforce for like five or six years now. I'm actually not that new.
[00:12:31.810] 但当我仔细想想，坐下来认真思考之后，我就会想，哦，其实我在这家公司工作快四年了，或者说我已经工作五六年了。我其实不算新人。
[00:12:47.890] But for some reason, it's just kind of like I just feel that way. I think partially maybe because I have actually always been the youngest person at work. It's crazy because we're 27 now and I've still never experienced being older than someone at work.
[00:12:47.890] 但不知为何，我就是会有这种感觉。我想部分原因可能是我一直是公司里最年轻的人。说来也奇怪，我们都27年了，我却从未体验过比同事年纪大的感觉。
[00:13:04.610] Yeah, that is really interesting, actually. And maybe that's why I don't feel that necessarily at work so much, because I feel that every year we do have waves of like younger and younger people come in to work for a company.
[00:13:04.610] 是啊，这真的很有意思。也许这就是为什么我在工作中不太有这种感觉的原因，因为我觉得每年都会有一批又一批越来越年轻的人加入我们公司。
[00:13:19.090] And it's nice because they're so like non-jaded, not to say that everyone else is jaded, but they're very like fresh and bring like a specific vibe and energy to the workplace. But also it ages me a little bit where when I first joined the company, I was 22.
[00:13:19.090] 而且感觉很好，因为他们都很新鲜，没有丝毫世故，当然，我不是说其他人都很世故，但他们都很有活力，给工作场所带来了一种独特的氛围和能量。不过，这也让我感觉自己老了一些，因为我刚加入公司的时候才22岁。
[00:13:35.410] And then I'm just sitting here thinking, damn, I can't believe it's actually been a full five years here. Like the people at work have seen me move into an apartment in SF, get engaged by house.
[00:13:35.410] 然后我就坐在这里想，天哪，真不敢相信这五年竟然真的过去了。感觉同事们都看着我搬进旧金山的公寓，看着我订婚，看着我搬进新家。
[00:13:47.170] It's like crazy that they've seen me through these life stages so that it makes me feel old too, where I'm like, OK, these people that are new are in my position and now I have to take on a different role of older person that's been here kind of.
[00:13:47.170] 感觉很不可思议，他们见证了我人生中的这些阶段，这让我觉得自己也老了。我会想，好吧，这些新人现在处于我的位置，而我现在必须扮演一个不同的角色，一个在这里待了一段时间的长者。
[00:14:01.170] Yeah, it's kind of crazy because I always thought that I would eventually get to the point where I would see or meet people who are younger than me at work like every day, you know? Right. But it just hasn't been the case.
[00:14:01.170] 是啊，这有点不可思议，因为我一直以为我最终会达到那种每天都能在工作中见到比我年轻的人的地步，你知道吗？没错。但事实并非如此。
[00:14:16.770] And I guess because of that, I always feel like I'm playing catch up to other people like, oh, I'm getting closer to everyone else's average age versus like, oh, nice. There's younger people coming in. Wait till you hear that everyone else is also aging.
[00:14:16.770] 我想正因为如此，我总觉得自己在追赶别人，比如，“哦，我越来越接近大家的平均年龄了”，而不是，“哦，不错，有更年轻的人加入。等等，你很快就会发现，其他人也都在变老。”
[00:14:34.450] I know, dude, I can never catch up. But I do think when we do hire new people, there is like kind of an average age there. So that is like the pinpoint where I'm like, oh, I'm like getting closer to that.
[00:14:34.450] 我知道，伙计，我永远也追不上。但我确实觉得，我们招新人的时候，他们的年龄好像有个平均水平。所以，我感觉自己离那个平均年龄越来越近了。
[00:14:49.890] Do you think that feeling pretty young at work impacts the way you see work or maybe impacts the way you see yourself at work a little bit? I think maybe a little bit for sure.
[00:14:49.890] 你觉得在工作中感觉自己还很年轻，这会影响你对工作的看法，或者对你在工作中的看法吗？我觉得肯定会有一点影响。
[00:15:02.770] It sometimes makes me feel like, oh, who am I to speak up, I guess, especially if it's like a bigger meeting or like a more important meeting. Not that I personally have to be in those too often, but I think it just adds to the
[00:15:02.770] 有时候我会觉得，哎，我有什么资格发言呢？尤其是在比较重要的会议上。倒不是说我个人经常要参加这类会议，但我觉得这只会增加……
[00:15:18.050] seniority of other people in my mind, whether it's subconscious or consciously. It's kind of like whatever they say goes, I can put in a small word. But who am I to have a huge impact anyway?
[00:15:18.050] 在我看来，其他人的资历在我心中始终占据主导地位，无论是潜意识的还是有意识的。感觉就像他们说什么就是什么，我只能插上几句话。但我又有什么资格去产生巨大的影响呢？
[00:15:31.490] That's a really good point because it kind of cements to in my mind of leadership or people who can have very strong opinions about stuff are older. So that sometimes when people at my company who are, you know, my age or maybe even younger
[00:15:31.490] 这一点说得很好，因为它让我更加确信，领导者或者那些对事情有强烈见解的人往往年纪比较大。所以有时候，我公司里那些和我同龄甚至更年轻的人，他们的意见往往比较强势。
[00:15:46.610] than me, like when they speak up and they have a strong opinion and they're like really pushing for that opinion, I'm kind of like, whoa, that's crazy that you did that, even though you're whatever age.
[00:15:46.610] 比起我，当他们发表意见，并且有强烈的个人观点，并且真的在努力争取这种观点时，我就会想，哇，你这样做太疯狂了，即使你已经到了某个年纪。
[00:15:59.410] Which is kind of like the wrong way to think about it because being older doesn't mean you have a better opinion all the time. But I guess I just always correlate like age with experience.
[00:15:59.410] 这种想法其实不太对，因为年纪大并不意味着你的观点就一定更好。但我总觉得年龄和经验是一回事。
[00:16:09.570] So I know what you mean about like feeling shy or maybe thinking like, maybe I'll shoot someone an email after this meeting. Yeah, for sure. I think it also sometimes leads to like maybe personal confusion.
[00:16:09.570] 所以我知道你说的那种害羞的感觉，或者那种会后想“或许我会在会后给某人发封邮件”的想法。没错，确实如此。我觉得这有时也会导致一些个人困惑。
[00:16:23.730] So I guess an example is that actually the team that I'm on right now, I've been part of it since its inception, which is not even that long ago. It's like two years ago, I guess.
[00:16:23.730] 举个例子来说，我现在所在的这个团队，我从它成立之初就一直是其中的一员，其实时间也不算长，大概也就两年吧。
[00:16:36.770] But like this team was sort of newly formed, reorg and like bits and pieces formed together to become what it is now. So low key, like in a way, I have a certain degree of like more experience than other
[00:16:36.770] 但这个团队算是新组建的，经过重组，各个部分慢慢拼凑起来才变成现在的样子。所以说，某种程度上，我的经验比其他人要丰富一些。
[00:16:52.690] people on the specific team because I've been there since its inception. But of course, like other people might be higher level, like literal corporate level. Yeah, I guess sometimes there's that aspect that you kind of forget about and then it's
[00:16:52.690] 因为我从团队成立之初就在那里，所以我对团队成员的了解比较深入。当然，其他人可能级别更高，比如公司高层。是啊，我想有时候你会忽略这一点，然后……
[00:17:06.450] like, oh wait, if you think about it, I do have things I can bring to the table or like knowledge that people might not have known beforehand about this team. So there's like this in addition to the like feeling like a kid, you're like, oh, well,
[00:17:06.450] 比如，哦等等，仔细想想，我的确能为球队带来一些东西，或者说一些大家之前可能不知道的关于这支球队的信息。所以，除了那种像孩子一样的感觉之外，你还会想，哦，好吧。
[00:17:21.570] actually, I guess I'm not a kid or I know certain things. And then your mind is like, what am I? Yeah, it's definitely always a trip to explain things to people that are clearly older than
[00:17:21.570] 其实，我想我应该不算小孩子了，或者说我知道一些事情。然后你就会想，我到底算什么？是啊，跟那些明显比我年长的人解释事情，总是件挺有意思的事。
[00:17:35.170] you or maybe in like a higher level or like older life stage than you. Yeah. Where I'm like, I can't believe I have something to teach you because you're older. I don't know. It like doesn't make any sense. But at the same time, I think it does.
[00:17:35.170] 或许你比我更有经验，或者说我的人生阶段比你更成熟。是啊。我感觉自己好像还能教你点什么，因为你比我年长。我也不知道。这听起来好像没什么道理。但同时，我觉得又好像有点道理。
[00:17:47.490] You know, I do feel like in the professional world, technically everyone is supposed to be like ageless, right? Like you're all in professional society together. Really what matters is probably like you said, like the corporate level or what managerial tier you're in. I don't know.
[00:17:47.490] 你知道，我觉得在职场上，理论上每个人都应该不受年龄限制，对吧？感觉大家都在同一个职业圈子里。真正重要的可能就像你说的，是你在公司里的级别或者管理层级。我也不知道。
[00:18:05.650] I wonder if there's like a specific age where that flips and you no longer are so conscious about it. Dude, I don't know. But something that was kind of interesting was I was grabbing lunch with a couple of
[00:18:05.650] 我很好奇是不是到了某个特定的年纪，这种想法就会转变，不再那么在意这些事。老兄，我也不知道。不过有件挺有意思的事，我和一对夫妇一起吃午饭的时候……
[00:18:17.250] coworkers the other day and one of them wasn't directly on my team, just someone who sits nearby and like we sometimes work together with. And he straight up asked us our ages. Whoa. And I was like, whoa, because I never reveal my age at work. Yeah.
[00:18:17.250] 前几天和几个同事聊天，其中一个不是我的团队成员，只是坐在附近，偶尔会一起工作。他竟然直接问了我们年龄。哇哦。我当时就懵了，因为我从来不在工作场合透露自己的年龄。是啊。
[00:18:36.530] Because I try not to come off as younger. I'm always consciously fighting this kid mindset, you know? Right. But it's okay. It was like a very casual lunch and it was just like three of us.
[00:18:36.530] 因为我尽量不让自己显得太年轻。我一直在有意识地克服这种孩子气的心态，你知道吗？对。不过没关系。那只是一顿很随意的午餐，只有我们三个人。
[00:18:48.610] So I was like shifty eyed for a bit and I was like, um, I'm 27. And then my coworker was like, I'm 38. And I was like, whoa, because I actually didn't know his age either. I don't ever explicitly ask our teammates either because I'm not trying to age them.
[00:18:48.610] 所以当时我眼神有点闪烁，就说：“嗯，我27岁。”然后我的同事说：“我38岁。”我当时就懵了，因为我其实也不知道他的年龄。我从来不会主动问队友的年龄，因为我不想让他们知道我的年龄。
[00:19:07.970] Right. I'm not trying to de-age them. You know, I'm just trying to like take everyone at face value pretty much, which is how I hope they take me. But when he like revealed his age, I was like, oh shit.
[00:19:07.970] 对。我不是想让他们看起来更年轻。你知道，我只是想尽量以诚相待，也希望他们能以诚相待。但当他透露自己的年龄时，我当时就想，糟了。
[00:19:21.090] Like this guy's a little older than I thought he was. I thought he was more like maybe mid to early-ish 30s. But yeah, I was like, oh no, I hope this doesn't change the way like our work relationship is because we have like a pretty good work relationship.
[00:19:21.090] 这人比我想象的要大一些。我以为他大概三十五六岁左右。不过，我当时就想，糟了，我希望这不会影响我们之间的工作关系，因为我们工作关系一直挺好的。
[00:19:38.530] But I guess like just knowing that information, it's like in the back of your mind, you're like, oh shit, this guy's like a little older than I thought. And he's probably like, oh, Crystal's like a little younger than I thought.
[00:19:38.530] 但我觉得，知道这些信息之后，你会潜意识里想，哎呀，这家伙比我想象的要大一些。而他可能也会想，哦，克丽丝塔尔比我想象的要年轻一些。
[00:19:50.850] It like kind of sucks, but I do agree that it somewhat changes it. I think it's actually better, like you said, to just not know at all. Then you can only speculate and you can give a pretty broad range of like, okay, this guy's
[00:19:50.850] 这确实有点糟糕，但我同意这在某种程度上改变了情况。我觉得就像你说的，最好还是完全不知道。这样你就只能猜测，而且可以给出相当宽泛的推测，比如，好吧，这个人……
[00:20:02.690] like between 30 to 40 or something. Like between like 35 to 45 or something. Or it's like, oh, this guy is just, he's older than me. Or like, you know, this person is just older than me. Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:02.690] 大概30到40岁之间吧。或者35到45岁之间吧。或者就是，哦，这个人比我年纪大。或者，你知道，这个人就是比我年纪大。对，没错。
[00:20:15.810] But once you know, it's like you see their face and their age is like hovering over there. Luckily, I don't feel like it's affecting anything so far. But you know, our ages were revealed on Thursday and right now it's Sunday. So it's only been a few days.
[00:20:15.810] 但一旦你知道了，就好像你看到他们的脸，他们的年龄就悬在那里一样。幸运的是，到目前为止，我觉得这并没有影响到什么。你知道，我们的年龄是周四公布的，现在是周日，所以才过了几天而已。
[00:20:33.010] Actually, I found the ageless work society thing kind of interesting in the US. And I've grown up in the US like my whole life basically since I was four. But I do consume a lot of like Korean cultural stuff.
[00:20:33.010] 其实，我觉得美国那种不分年龄的工作社会挺有意思的。我从四岁起就在美国生活，基本上算是从小到大都生活在这里。不过，我也经常接触韩国文化。
[00:20:47.890] And I think in Korea, age is a really strong arbiter of like hierarchy. So you know, people with even just maybe as small as like a three month or six month age difference use different honorifics languages with each other.
[00:20:47.890] 我认为在韩国，年龄是衡量等级制度的重要标准。所以，即使年龄只相差三到六个月，人们之间也会使用不同的敬语。
[00:21:05.410] And there's some sort of hierarchy of like, okay, seniority deems who says what to who, but then so does the age hierarchy. So there's all these rules that are both confusing, but in some ways, like comforting at the same time, because it's some sort of structure.
[00:21:05.410] 这里存在某种等级制度，比如，资历决定了谁该对谁说什么，年龄也决定了谁该说什么。所以这些规则既让人困惑，但在某种程度上又让人感到安心，因为它提供了一种结构。
[00:21:19.570] So you know exactly what you're supposed to say to like what person, but in the US, like everyone is addressed by first name and doesn't matter what the age is. And you're all just coworkers and you all hang out and stuff like that.
[00:21:19.570] 所以你知道该对谁说什么，但在美国，大家都直呼其名，年龄根本不重要。你们都是同事，经常一起出去玩什么的。
[00:21:32.530] You know, I just thought it was kind of hard to adjust to and adjust isn't even the right word because I've never worked in like anything, you know, in like a Korean company or in Korea at all.
[00:21:32.530] 你知道，我只是觉得很难适应，而且“适应”这个词都不太准确，因为我从来没有在韩国公司工作过，或者根本没在韩国待过。
[00:21:43.570] But it just felt wrong to just like address significantly older coworkers by their first name and just like talk to them about daily life. You know, when we're talking about someone's kids or like someone's families, it's like normal or like it doesn't feel as weird.
[00:21:43.570] 但直接称呼年纪大很多的同事的名字，和他们聊日常生活，总感觉不太对劲。你知道，聊到别人的孩子或者家人的时候，就觉得很正常，不会觉得那么奇怪。
[00:21:59.650] But I feel like when you start talking about like, oh, what do you do on Friday nights and things like that? I'm just like, oh my god, this is like, very interesting. Yeah. You're like, am I learning too much about you or is this just the right amount?
[00:21:59.650] 但我觉得，当你开始聊一些诸如“哦，你周五晚上都干些什么”之类的话题时，我就觉得，天哪，这太有意思了。是啊。你会想，我是不是了解得太多了，还是刚刚好？
[00:22:13.730] Exactly. I feel like it's still something that I'm kind of grappling with. And my hope is like the day that I finally see someone younger than me at work, I will start to feel more like an adult. You'll be free from your curse. Yeah.
[00:22:13.730] 没错。我觉得我还在努力克服这个问题。我希望有一天，当我终于在工作中看到比我年轻的人时，我就会开始觉得自己更像个大人了。你会摆脱这种困扰。是啊。
[00:22:32.130] But speaking of, do you have moments on the flip side that make you feel very adult-like? So I would say that cooking and like doing house chores makes me feel very adult. I mean, there's some house chores that I've done since college or even since like high
[00:22:32.130] 不过说到这个，你有没有一些时刻，会让你觉得自己很成熟？我觉得做饭和做家务之类的事情会让我觉得自己很成熟。我的意思是，有些家务我从大学甚至高中就开始做了。
[00:22:52.050] school and things like that. So like, I guess cooking is somewhat part of it. But like laundry, for example, doesn't make me feel old. But really like sitting down and preparing like a full meal for myself and James or even
[00:22:52.050] 上学之类的事情。所以，我觉得做饭也算是其中一部分。但像洗衣服这种事，并不会让我觉得自己老了。但真正让我感到老的，是坐下来为自己和詹姆斯准备一顿完整的饭菜，或者……
[00:23:04.130] having like dinner parties or something makes me feel kind of old. Like I can't help but see myself as my mom in a sense. You know, I just think about all those times my mom has prepared food and it's kind of
[00:23:04.130] 举办晚宴之类的活动会让我觉得自己有点老了。感觉自己好像在某种程度上变成了我妈妈。你知道，我总会想起妈妈以前做饭的那些日子，感觉……
[00:23:19.170] like a bittersweet feeling, I would say, where I'm like, oh, that's so cool. This is like what mom used to do. But at the same time, I'm like, damn, if I'm my mom's age and doing what mom used to do, that mom is like older now. Right.
[00:23:19.170] 感觉很复杂，一方面，我会想，哦，这太酷了。这跟我妈以前做的事很像。但同时，我又会想，哎，如果我到了我妈这个年纪，做着我妈以前做的事，那我妈现在也老了。对吧。
[00:23:32.210] Which is also kind of tougher to grapple with. That is a good one, though. I think I can agree. Like there's a difference between cooking for yourself and cooking for more than what like yourself.
[00:23:32.210] 这也确实更难把握。不过，这确实是个好问题。我想我能同意。就像为自己做饭和为多人做饭是有区别的。
[00:23:44.770] And then when you're cooking for other people too, there's definitely a sense of like responsibility and like adult-ness. No, it's so true. I think especially like hosting people and you're like, oh, I have this shopping list
[00:23:44.770] 而且当你还要为别人做饭的时候，肯定会有一种责任感和成熟感。没错，确实如此。我觉得尤其是在招待客人的时候，你会想，哦，我这里有个购物清单。
[00:23:59.090] of party stuff and, you know, I want to be a good hostess. And like really that hostess thing is what makes me feel like I'm a 40-year-old suburban housewife or something. You're like, damn, I can do it all. Exactly. Wow. Wow.
[00:23:59.090] 派对上的事儿我都懂，而且，你知道，我想成为一个好女主人。说真的，做女主人这件事让我觉得自己像个40岁的郊区家庭主妇似的。你会想，天哪，我什么都能做。没错。哇。哇。
[00:24:18.930] I guess like if I think about what makes me feel adult, low-key seeing people in college like undergrad makes me feel kind of old. And I think it's like the reflection and the thought where it's like, oh, shoot, like we used to be at that age.
[00:24:18.930] 我想，如果我思考什么会让我觉得自己成熟，那么看到大学生，比如本科生，会让我感觉自己有点老了。我觉得这就像是反思和思考，然后会想，哦，天哪，我们以前也经历过那个年纪。
[00:24:37.890] And I thought that like the current age we're at 26, 27, I mean nearly 28 is like they have their life put together. And then we're here and I'm like, hmm, not so sure about that one. But I guess we are adults in a sense. Dude, that's such a good one.
[00:24:37.890] 我当时想，像我们现在这个年纪，26、27岁，快28岁了，感觉人生都走上正轨了。然后我们到了这个年纪，我就想，嗯，这话可不太准。不过我想，从某种意义上说，我们也是成年人了。哥们儿，这话说得真好。
[00:24:57.010] I went to a concert near UC Berkeley a couple months ago and I think that was move-in week or something like that, like maybe freshman orientation week. So everyone on the streets were clearly freshmen.
[00:24:57.010] 几个月前我去加州大学伯克利分校附近听了一场音乐会，我记得当时好像是新生入学周之类的，可能是新生迎新周之类的。所以街上到处都是大一新生。
[00:25:09.890] At least I really felt like they were because they were like taking photos and like dressed to the nines on a random Thursday night. And I was like, wow, this is, you know, they're feeling stuff that we felt 10 years ago, which is just like horrible to think about.
[00:25:09.890] 至少我感觉他们确实如此，因为他们在一个普通的周四晚上，穿着盛装拍照。我就想，哇，你知道，他们现在感受到的，正是我们十年前感受到的，想到这些就觉得可怕。
[00:25:23.970] Oh, God. We're so fucking old. The crazy part is like we're not even that old in the grand scheme of things. But like I can totally understand when people are like, oh my God, like you're so young.
[00:25:23.970] 我的天啊，我们真的老了。更不可思议的是，从长远来看，我们其实并不算老。但我完全能理解为什么人们会说：“我的天哪，你们看起来好年轻啊。”
[00:25:38.530] I was once your age because we're feeling that to like, you know, the slightly younger generation. Right. We're just going to keep feeling it in waves. Oh my God. Yeah, that's a really good one though.
[00:25:38.530] 我曾经也像你这么大，因为我们，你知道，比你年轻一辈的人，也有这种感觉。没错。我们会一直感受到这种情绪，一波接一波。我的天哪。嗯，这话说得真好。
[00:25:51.490] There's nothing like seeing someone significantly younger than you to remind you of your old age. Dude, also for some reason on TikTok I keep getting like, oh, weekly study vlog or like study plans for a great fall quarter.
[00:25:51.490] 看到比你年轻很多的人，真的会让你意识到自己老了。哥们儿，不知道为什么，我在TikTok上老是看到一些“每周学习vlog”或者“秋季学期学习计划”之类的东西。
[00:26:07.970] I'm like, I'm like a 27 year old, like five years into work. Please stop recommending this. OK, but does it feel worse to get millennial TikTok? Oh God. Or like Gen Z, like young TikTok, you know? That's a good one, honestly.
[00:26:07.970] 我都27岁了，工作五年了，求求你们别再推荐这个了。好吧，但是千禧一代的TikTok是不是更糟糕？我的天。或者像Z世代，年轻一代的TikTok，你知道吗？说真的，这个挺贴切的。
[00:26:30.290] I want to say I'm really not on millennial TikTok much, which is good. It's just specifically the study stuff where I'm like, fuck, should I study something to feel young again? You're like, take this part out of the algorithm. Yeah, yeah. Not interested.
[00:26:30.290] 我想说，我其实不太玩千禧一代的TikTok，这挺好的。主要是那些学习相关的内容，看完我就想，我去，要不要学点什么让自己感觉年轻点？你会说，把这部分内容从算法里删掉。是啊是啊，没兴趣。
[00:26:49.010] Dude, actually I get a lot of millennial TikTok stuff. Oh my God, Crystal, you're old. It's like the people who are creating the content are also clearly millennials. And then also sometimes it's like work related or, you know, that kind of stuff or like things
[00:26:49.010] 老兄，其实我经常收到千禧一代的TikTok视频。我的天哪，Crystal，你都老了。感觉那些内容创作者也都是千禧一代。而且有时候还会收到一些工作相关的视频，或者你知道的，诸如此类的东西。
[00:27:06.210] that millennials are into, like Harry Potter or like, you know, very specific, like that kind of stuff. Yeah. And at first I didn't think much about it, but then after a while I was like, oh shit, I'm low key on millennial TikTok.
[00:27:06.210] 千禧一代喜欢哈利·波特之类的东西，或者你知道的，非常具体的东西，就是那种。是的。一开始我没太在意，但过了一段时间后，我就想，糟了，我居然悄悄地混进了千禧一代的TikTok圈子。
[00:27:22.930] It's like I'm shocked, but it's also a little bit fitting. I think if we traded TikTok algorithms or like for you pages, we would both have a culture shock. Because mine is like really dumb.
[00:27:22.930] 我感觉很震惊，但又觉得有点讽刺。我觉得如果我们互换TikTok算法或者点赞页面，我们俩都会经历文化冲击。因为我的算法真的挺蠢的。
[00:27:41.250] I get like bits and pieces of Gen Z, but for the most part it's just like millennial stuff. So I guess outside of our families and outside of the workplace, when you're just out and
[00:27:41.250] 我偶尔会接触到Z世代的一些事情，但大部分时候还是千禧一代的风格。所以我想，除了家庭和工作场所之外，当你外出的时候……
[00:27:53.650] about, maybe like grocery shopping or just on the streets at cafes or restaurants on the weekends, you know, just living your life outside of these two spheres. Are there any things that make you feel old or young? Oh my God. Actually, yes.
[00:27:53.650] 比如，像去超市买菜，或者周末在街边的咖啡馆或餐馆闲逛，你知道，就是体验一下这两个圈子之外的生活。有没有什么事会让你觉得自己老了或者年轻了？我的天哪。其实，有的。
[00:28:09.730] Sometimes when I'm out and about, in my mind, a like constant thought I have is, wow, I hope I don't look like some high school kid or like college kid running around. Yeah.
[00:28:09.730] 有时候我出门在外，脑子里总会冒出一个念头：哇，我希望我看起来不像个到处乱跑的高中生或大学生。是啊。
[00:28:22.450] I guess especially if we're near like a school or something like that, I'm like, whoa, I hope I don't blend in too much with these college kids who are like literally almost 10 years younger than us. Damn, that's so interesting.
[00:28:22.450] 我想，尤其是当我们在学校之类的附近时，我就会想，哇，我希望我不会和那些比我们小将近10岁的大学生太像了。天哪，这太有意思了。
[00:28:36.210] I feel like I never have had thoughts like that. Dude, I don't know. I like have that thought and I'm like, oh wow, like I guess I probably totally pass as them because like realistically, you know, early 20s and late 20s, we look pretty similar
[00:28:36.210] 我感觉我以前从来没想过这种事。老兄，我也不知道。我突然冒出这么个念头，然后我就想，哇，我估计我看起来跟他们很像，因为说实话，你知道，二十出头到快三十岁的时候，我们长得确实挺像的。
[00:28:51.090] in terms of like age wise. It's hard to like tell that difference. I mean, honestly, like a lot of 30 year olds look the same as well. So that's definitely a thought I have. It happens less when I'm grocery shopping because I'm usually focused on like, oh, I
[00:28:51.090] 就年龄而言，很难分辨出年龄的差别。说实话，很多30岁的人看起来也差不多。所以这确实是我考虑过的问题。这种情况在我去超市购物时比较少见，因为我通常专注于买东西，比如……
[00:29:04.850] need to get these things. But I think the thought does kind of cross my mind sometimes. Maybe in my shopping list, I have like something that has alcohol in it and like, oh, I'm going to get carded because I look so young. Fuck.
[00:29:04.850] 我需要买这些东西。但我有时确实会冒出这种想法。比如，我的购物清单里可能列了含酒精的东西，然后我就想，哦，我看起来这么年轻，肯定会被查身份证。真倒霉。
[00:29:19.330] You know, that kind of stuff. That's interesting. Yeah, I think I know what you mean because I guess when you put everyone from 20 to like early 30s on a suspect line or whatever and try to identify everyone into the right age bucket, it's probably hard to do that.
[00:29:19.330] 你知道，就是那种事。挺有意思的。嗯，我想我明白你的意思了，因为我觉得，如果你把所有20岁到30岁出头的人都列为嫌疑人，然后试图把每个人都归入正确的年龄段，那可能很难做到。
[00:29:34.850] I will say my thoughts on age are maybe not as positive as yours where I'm like, damn, I wonder if I look hella old or, you know, I just have like fear of aging, right? Which I think is somewhat natural around this age range.
[00:29:34.850] 我得说，我对年龄的看法可能不像你那么积极，我会想，哎呀，我看起来是不是老得不行了？或者，你知道，我只是有点害怕变老，对吧？我觉得在这个年龄段，这种感觉挺正常的。
[00:29:48.050] But I will say like I have had experiences where, you know, I'm so used to like working now and I feel like I'm 35 or something like at work. That's how old I feel.
[00:29:48.050] 但我想说的是，我有过这样的经历：你知道，我现在很习惯工作，感觉自己在工作中好像有35岁左右似的。我就是感觉自己这么老。
[00:29:58.930] And then I'll go and get like a facial somewhere and, you know, the facial ladies are supposed to be nice to you, but they'll be like, oh, you're pretty young, huh? Like how recently did you graduate college or something? And I'm like, what the fuck?
[00:29:58.930] 然后我去某个地方做个面部护理，你知道，做护理的女士们应该对你很友好，但她们会说，哦，你看起来很年轻啊？比如你大学毕业多久了之类的？我就想，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:30:09.810] Like, how do you know? Because I feel like I'm almost 40 in a couple of years. So that's always sort of interesting where I think depending on what environment you feel the most yourself in or maybe like feel like you're in the most, maybe that's what
[00:30:09.810] 你怎么知道的？因为我觉得再过几年我就快40岁了。所以这总是挺有意思的，我觉得这取决于你感觉最自在的环境，或者说你感觉自己最常待的环境，也许这就是原因。
[00:30:26.930] kind of guides your age. And then when people say stuff that's not similar to that internal age that you think of yourself as, I feel like that's where the jarring like thoughts kind of happen. Maybe.
[00:30:26.930] 它在某种程度上会影响你的年龄判断。然后，当别人说的话与你内心认同的年龄不符时，我觉得就会产生一些不协调的想法。也许吧。
[00:30:41.730] Okay, so sometimes also I live kind of close to a school and when I come back from work, if I like come back really early in the day, sometimes I catch the like wave of people picking up their kids.
[00:30:41.730] 好的，有时候我住的地方离学校比较近，如果我下班回家，而且是一大早就回来，有时候会赶上家长们接孩子的高峰期。
[00:30:55.970] They're like all over the streets, like ants and stuff. And I'll like park in front of my house and I'll get out of my car and I have this like just random thought cross my mind.
[00:30:55.970] 它们就像蚂蚁一样，到处都是。我把车停在我家门前，下车后，脑子里就会突然冒出一个念头。
[00:31:09.650] I wonder if I look like a college kid to these people or like a fully functioning adult. And then I like quietly walk into my home. Yeah, that's the Asian genes always doing us good in the aging area. Yeah.
[00:31:09.650] 我不知道在这些人眼里，我看起来像个大学生还是个完全成熟的成年人。然后我就静静地走进家门。是啊，这就是亚洲基因在抗衰老方面的优势。没错。
[00:31:26.850] But interestingly, you said like internally you feel like you're 35. Yeah, I guess it kind of swings pretty hard. Like, I think my thoughts and feelings are sensitive to my environment. You know, times where I'm working a lot, I really do feel like I'm the average age of
[00:31:26.850] 但有趣的是，你说你感觉自己内心只有35岁。是啊，我觉得这种感觉波动挺大的。我觉得我的想法和感受很容易受到环境的影响。你知道，当我工作很忙的时候，我真的会觉得自己像个普通人。
[00:31:45.890] my coworkers who I feel like maybe somewhere around 35-ish. And you know, I think it's just like, I don't know if it's like fucking hormones or something, but like my wanting to have kids really badly too. I'm just like ready, you know? Yeah.
[00:31:45.890] 我的同事们，我觉得他们大概都35岁左右吧。你知道，我觉得这可能就是，我不知道是不是荷尔蒙作祟，但我真的很想要孩子。我已经准备好了，你知道吗？嗯。
[00:31:59.010] I'm like, okay, actually like I probably should wait a couple years, enjoy the marriage life and whatnot and not do it. But you know, I just feel like a 35-year-old mom waiting for my physical body to like catch up sort of. Oh my God. Yeah.
[00:31:59.010] 我心想，好吧，其实我应该再等几年，好好享受婚姻生活什么的，别那么快就生。但你知道，我感觉自己就像一个35岁的妈妈，在等着自己的身体恢复到以前的状态。我的天哪。是啊。
[00:32:13.970] And you know, of course when I go back to Dallas and like visit my parents or even when I visit James's mom sometimes I do still get that like, oh, I'm a kid vibe.
[00:32:13.970] 当然，你知道，当我回到达拉斯去看望我的父母，或者有时去看望詹姆斯的妈妈时，我仍然会有那种感觉，哦，我还是个孩子。
[00:32:24.210] But what really makes me feel old is when we have hangouts planned and like social things and you know, towards like the back 10% or 15% of the hangout, I'm like, oh, I have this like other thing I need to do. That really makes me feel old.
[00:32:24.210] 但真正让我觉得自己老了的是，当我们计划好聚会和社交活动时，你知道，到了聚会进行到大约10%或15%的时候，我就会想，哦，我还有其他事情要做。这真的让我觉得自己老了。
[00:32:42.290] You're like, I got shit to do, errands to run. Yeah. And maybe a part of being a child or like having that childlike innocence is you're just like blissful all the time, no worries and things like that.
[00:32:42.290] 你会想，我还有一堆事要做，一堆杂事要办。是啊。也许身为孩子或者拥有那种孩子般的纯真，就是你总是感到无比幸福，没有烦恼之类的。
[00:32:55.490] But I have shit I'm worrying about in my life, you know? I have like things to clean and like chores to do. And you know, sometimes it's like I have to sleep early for work and that really makes me feel old.
[00:32:55.490] 但我生活中也有很多烦心事，你知道吗？比如要打扫卫生，要做家务。而且，有时候为了上班还得早睡，这真的让我觉得自己老了。
[00:33:08.370] I'm like, I can't have a life because I have a nine to five. Wow, that's so interesting. Because I think I've definitely experienced similar things, right? Like, oh, I got to sleep earlier tonight because I got to get to work early tomorrow or like,
[00:33:08.370] 我感觉自己好像没法过自己的生活，因为我得朝九晚五地工作。哇，这真有意思。因为我觉得我肯定也有过类似的经历，对吧？比如，哦，我今晚得早点睡，因为明天要早起上班，或者，
[00:33:23.650] oh, I got some chores to do back home. But for some reason that doesn't tie to age for me. At least it doesn't make me feel older necessarily. It just feels like, oh, that's just like life right now. But yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:23.650] 哦，我回家还有些家务要做。但不知为何，这对我来说和年龄没关系。至少它不会让我觉得自己老了。感觉就像，哦，这就是我现在的生活。不过，我也不知道为什么。
[00:33:38.050] I actually sometimes forget my age and maybe mentally I almost think I'm closer to 24, 25. And maybe that's why I feel more like a kid. I don't know. It's just like, I don't know what it is. Maybe that's like around the age COVID happened.
[00:33:38.050] 我有时候真的会忘记自己的年龄，可能心理上觉得自己差不多24、25岁。也许这就是为什么我感觉自己更像个孩子。我也不知道。就是，我也不知道为什么。也许跟新冠疫情爆发的时候差不多是那个年纪有关吧。
[00:33:55.810] So maybe that was like trauma without realizing. Dude, that's such a good point, actually. We just like lost years off our life. Right? So I think part of it is that like maybe we definitely kind of just like lost a couple
[00:33:55.810] 所以也许那就像是无意识的创伤。兄弟，你说得太对了。我们就像白白浪费了几年寿命。对吧？所以我觉得部分原因可能是，我们确实白白浪费了好几年。
[00:34:09.970] of years of our lives just sitting at home doing not much. So then maybe mentally I'm just like, yeah, I'm still like 25. I think it's kind of comforting in a way that you and I both have different,
[00:34:09.970] 多年来，我们的生活就是待在家里无所事事。所以，也许在精神上，我感觉自己仍然像25岁一样。我觉得你我都有不同的经历，这在某种程度上也算是一种安慰。
[00:34:22.690] I guess like internal age clocks or whatnot, because that just makes me realize that it's so relative. Like it's so based on your living environment or maybe like your priorities at the moment or your like weekly lifestyle and schedule, your internal attitude, like all these things
[00:34:22.690] 我想这大概就像是内在的年龄时钟之类的东西吧，因为这让我意识到年龄真的太相对了。它很大程度上取决于你的生活环境，或者你当下的优先事项，或者你每周的生活方式和日程安排，你的内心态度，诸如此类的因素。
[00:34:41.010] kind of form that. And we're the same age, but we just have like different thoughts about it. So then it makes me feel like, okay, it's just like a fake age. I'm not actually 35. I am 27.
[00:34:41.010] 有点像那样。我们同龄，但对年龄的看法却截然不同。这让我感觉，好吧，这只是个虚假的年龄。我其实不是35岁，我只有27岁。
[00:34:55.090] And if I wanted to, I could think that I'm 24, 25, but it's just how I'm choosing to live my life right now. You're like, it's time to wind back that clock. Dude, I don't know.
[00:34:55.090] 如果我愿意，我可以觉得自己只有24、25岁，但我现在就是这么生活的。你会觉得，是时候让时光倒流了。兄弟，我不知道。
[00:35:08.290] I think I feel the age a little bit in the loss of like spontaneity in my life. There's plenty of things that I still do spontaneously unplanned that I find very fun.
[00:35:08.290] 我觉得随着年龄增长，生活中少了些许随性。不过，我仍然会做一些很多即兴的、没有计划的事情，我觉得这些事情非常有趣。
[00:35:20.930] But for example, like in high school, even on a school night, if I wanted to see the stars or something like me and my friend Nat would go and we would go like stargaze. And it was like this huge adventure to like explore the world.
[00:35:20.930] 但举个例子，就像高中时，即使是上学日的晚上，如果我想看星星什么的，我和我的朋友纳特就会去观星。那就像一次探索世界的巨大冒险。
[00:35:34.770] And everything was just so like new and cool because we had just gotten like our cars basically. So like I can never forget that feeling or like even the scent of the outdoor air, like at 9pm on like a Wednesday or something with Nat.
[00:35:34.770] 一切都那么新鲜酷炫，因为我们刚买了车。所以我永远也忘不了那种感觉，还有户外空气的气息，就像某个星期三晚上九点，和娜特在一起的时候。
[00:35:49.330] And to this day, I think I still kind of romanticize stargazing in a way. But every time I sit down and I try to like plan it into the calendar, I'm like,
[00:35:49.330] 直到今天，我仍然在某种程度上对观星抱有浪漫的幻想。但每次我坐下来，试图把它安排到日程表上时，我都会想：
[00:35:58.530] this isn't a good day because tomorrow I have an 8am meeting and this isn't a good day because I have to go like shower early and like meet up with whoever on like Saturday morning. And I'm just like, what the fuck?
[00:35:58.530] 今天真是倒霉透了，明天早上八点有个会，而且周六早上还得早起洗澡，跟人碰面。我当时就想，这他妈到底是怎么回事？
[00:36:08.610] I'm like mourning this part of my life. That's so funny. You're like, oh, this is actually not a good day because we got some smoke up in California. Yeah, exactly. It's too much logic now. Dang, that's true.
[00:36:08.610] 我感觉自己好像在为人生中的这段时光哀悼。真好笑。你会想，哦，今天其实不太好，因为加州那边有点烟雾。是啊，没错。现在一切都太讲逻辑了。哎，确实如此。
[00:36:25.570] There's definitely like a loss of spontaneity and I think it's inevitable. Like no matter how spontaneous you are as a person, there's definitely some structure you have to enact in your life, at least a little bit to like keep things up and running. Right.
[00:36:25.570] 确实，生活中少了些许自发性，我认为这是不可避免的。无论你本人多么随性，生活中也肯定需要建立一些结构，至少要有点结构，才能让一切正常运转。没错。
[00:36:41.810] I think also, I was kind of thinking about this as you were talking. Maybe I also feel like I have like things I want to do before I feel ready to like, I don't know, take on more responsibility.
[00:36:41.810] 我想，在你说话的时候，我也一直在想这个问题。也许我也觉得，在准备好承担更多责任之前，我还有一些想做的事情。
[00:36:59.330] Like how you are like, yo, I'm low-key ready to have a kid. But I'm like, dude, there's no way right now because I have like these things I want to do. So I wonder if maybe that's also something that plays into it where it's like, I feel
[00:36:59.330] 就像你会说，“嘿，我其实挺想生孩子的。”但我又会说，“兄弟，现在绝对不行，因为我还有很多事情想做。”所以我在想，这或许也是原因之一，感觉就像……
[00:37:12.530] like I still have some goals that I'm trying to reach. So that makes me feel younger. But I feel like for you, you've reached a lot of different big milestones, like engagement, buying a home, really from an objective point of view.
[00:37:12.530] 感觉我还有一些目标想要实现，这让我觉得自己更年轻了。但我觉得对你来说，你已经达成了很多人生中的重要里程碑，比如订婚、买房等等，客观来说是这样。
[00:37:28.610] Like it feels like you have a lot of things put together and like you're like settled in a certain sense. So I wonder if like because of that, it's another factor. You're like, yeah, dude, I'm ready.
[00:37:28.610] 感觉就像你已经把很多事情都安排妥当了，某种程度上也安定下来了。所以我在想，是不是因为这个原因，才让你觉得“是啊，兄弟，我准备好了”。
[00:37:41.410] I'm feeling steady and like, you know, able to take on these next level life tasks. That's so nice. But I think it does make sense because I think it's also maybe just human nature in a sense, at least for myself.
[00:37:41.410] 我感觉状态很稳定，好像能够应对人生中更高层次的任务了。这感觉真好。但我觉得这其实也合情合理，因为从某种意义上说，这或许也是人之常情，至少对我来说是这样。
[00:38:01.170] It's like there were certain things that I wanted to do before childbirth. And then now that those things are like somewhat being cleared out, I'm like, okay, childbirth. But I also kind of wonder, I've spent the last eight years of my life with James kind
[00:38:01.170] 感觉就像生孩子之前我想做某些事。现在这些事都差不多完成了，我就想，好吧，生孩子。但我也有点想，过去八年我的生活几乎都是和詹姆斯一起度过的。
[00:38:15.410] of like dreaming up of a future together. And I feel like there are certain goals that are easier to have when you are an individual person thinking about your personal goals versus like for a couple thinking of goals for you and your significant other.
[00:38:15.410] 就像一起畅想未来一样。我觉得有些目标，个人思考个人目标时更容易实现，而情侣一起思考共同目标时则容易落空。
[00:38:31.410] So then maybe that also kind of plays into it where like the balanced goals that you can have together as a couple are maybe more specific in nature. That's true. I feel like definitely.
[00:38:31.410] 所以，或许这也跟你们作为情侣可以共同设定的平衡目标有关，这些目标可能更具体一些。确实如此。我感觉肯定是这样。
[00:38:44.610] And, you know, honestly, that's a really good point you bring up about like being in a relationship because just the way that society dictates it right now, it's like such a norm to be
[00:38:44.610] 说实话，你提到的关于恋爱关系这一点真的很有道理，因为就目前社会对恋爱关系的固有观念而言，恋爱似乎成了一种常态。
[00:38:57.090] in a relationship and like, you know, eventually get married and do all that stuff, have kids, like whatever. Right. And I do feel like a lot of most people genuinely want to follow that path.
[00:38:57.090] 谈恋爱，然后，你知道，最终结婚，做所有那些事，生孩子，诸如此类。没错。而且我觉得大多数人真心想走这条路。
[00:39:09.970] But I mean, there's definitely people out there who are like, fuck it, like I'm totally fine being single. And then I guess like in that sense, like you said, some goals are like more, I guess
[00:39:09.970] 但我的意思是，肯定有人会觉得，去他的，单身也挺好的。然后我觉得，就像你说的，从某种意义上来说，有些目标更像是……
[00:39:22.770] like possible or like maybe even reachable when you're a couple because that's kind of just how society has been designed. And not to mention just like the crazy inflation and like capitalism that's dictating our world. But yeah, I think that is definitely a good point.
[00:39:22.770] 就像情侣之间有可能，甚至可能更容易实现，因为社会的设计就是这样。更别提疯狂的通货膨胀和主宰我们世界的资本主义了。不过，我觉得你说的很有道理。
[00:39:41.890] And also, I feel like, you know, just being with someone for so long, it also helps with that like foundational feeling. You're like, oh, we have like each other to rely on. And like you've built eight years of trust and like you're ready to build more.
[00:39:41.890] 而且，我觉得，你知道，和一个人相处这么久，也会有助于建立那种根基感。你会觉得，哦，我们彼此可以依靠。就像你们已经建立了八年的信任，并且准备好建立更多。
[00:39:58.370] So it's like, it's probably a very grounding thing to have is my guess. Maybe that's the trade off there, right? It's like I feel like there are definitely benefits to a certain sense of being single,
[00:39:58.370] 所以我觉得，单身可能是一种让人脚踏实地的感觉。也许这就是其中的利弊吧？我觉得单身确实有它的好处。
[00:40:13.970] especially in kind of like formative years of your adulthood where you can grow really fast and do a lot of trial and error and bump into walls and see your depths and lows and your peaks and highs or whatever.
[00:40:13.970] 尤其是在你成年初期那种形成期，你会成长得非常快，经历很多尝试和错误，撞到很多墙，看到你的低谷和高峰等等。
[00:40:29.810] I think you don't get as much of that up and down when you're in a relationship. So then you get more of like that stability aspect. But I think in terms of maybe like self-growth and self-exploration and just kind of like
[00:40:29.810] 我觉得谈恋爱的时候就不会有那么多起伏，所以会更稳定一些。但我觉得在自我成长、自我探索等方面，恋爱可能更有利。
[00:40:44.770] the adventurous aspect of life, I feel like you maybe don't get as much. So maybe that's why they say if you live, I mean, I guess I don't know who is saying this, but I feel like I've heard this before about single people in New York.
[00:40:44.770] 我觉得你可能没怎么体验到生活中的冒险乐趣。所以也许这就是为什么人们常说，如果你活着……我是说，我不知道是谁说的，但我感觉以前好像听过类似的说法，尤其是在纽约单身人士身上。
[00:40:59.570] They're like partying into their 40s as if they're still in their 20s. And I admire that in a sense, right? It's like, yeah, they are living like they're in their 20s and there's nothing wrong with that really.
[00:40:59.570] 他们就像四十多岁了还像二十多岁那样玩乐。从某种程度上来说，我很欣赏这一点，对吧？感觉就像，是啊，他们活得像二十多岁一样，这其实没什么错。
[00:41:12.530] It's just what they want to do and what they prioritize and looks fun as fuck too. Yeah, true. Like to each their own, do whatever feels right for you in the moment. Mm-hmm.
[00:41:12.530] 这只是他们想做的事，也是他们优先考虑的事，而且看起来也超级好玩。是啊，没错。每个人都有自己的选择，做任何你当下觉得对的事就好。嗯哼。
[00:41:23.330] Yeah, and I guess that also maybe shows like how environment could be a bit of a factor. Like New York's very fast paced. There's a lot to do. So it's very easy to get like caught up in whatever.
[00:41:23.330] 是的，我想这也可能说明环境是一个影响因素。比如纽约节奏非常快，有很多事情要做，所以很容易被各种事情缠身。
[00:41:35.730] So the focus isn't always form a family and like settle down right away. But then in the suburbs, it's like life is a little slower and you have more time to like really plan these things out and like take a good look at this.
[00:41:35.730] 所以，重点并不总是组建家庭，然后立刻安定下来。但在郊区，生活节奏会慢一些，你有更多的时间去认真规划这些事情，仔细考虑这些问题。
[00:41:47.890] So at least that's how I kind of view like suburbs versus city life pacing and stuff. Yeah, that's a really good point, actually. And I'm like personally very sensitive to where I live or like my environment.
[00:41:47.890] 所以至少我是这么看待郊区和城市生活节奏之类的。嗯，这确实是个很好的观点。而且我个人对我的居住地或者说我的环境非常敏感。
[00:42:01.650] So I feel like low-key if I grew up in like a farm in the countryside or something, I would be like, oh my God, I can't wait to like churn butter on the weekends or just like really lead into that farm life. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:01.650] 所以我觉得，如果我从小在乡下的农场长大，我可能会想，天哪，我等不及周末去搅黄油了，或者真的想体验那种农场生活。是啊，是啊。
[00:42:14.470] I think another kind of interesting thing about like age and stuff outside of environment is there's this like kind of saying or theory, I guess, that celebrities, they stay at the mental age that they became famous or like the year they became famous because it's
[00:42:14.470] 我认为关于年龄以及环境之外的其他因素，还有一种有趣的说法或理论，那就是名人的心理年龄会停留在他们成名时的年龄，或者说他们成名那年的年龄，因为……
[00:42:35.750] like a huge transitional year. And also like fame is low-key trauma because suddenly there's all these eyes on you. They're like nitpicking at your life and like watching everything you do, paparazzi chasing you around, all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:35.750] 就像一个巨大的过渡年。而且成名也是一种隐隐的创伤，因为突然间所有人都盯着你看。他们会对你的生活吹毛求疵，监视你的一举一动，狗仔队追着你跑，诸如此类的事情。
[00:42:53.190] It's interesting because I feel like that kind of theory is used as a past sometimes like, oh yeah, that's why like all these older male celebrities date so young because they're like mentally still at that age or something. Right.
[00:42:53.190] 这很有意思，因为我觉得这种理论有时会被用来解释过去的事情，比如，哦，对，这就是为什么那些年纪较大的男明星都和年轻女孩约会，因为他们的心智还停留在那个年纪之类的。没错。
[00:43:09.190] Or even they're just like, this was a stupid act, but like they've had so much scrutiny on them. At a certain point, it's not always their fault directly. So yeah, I mean, what do you think about that?
[00:43:09.190] 或者他们可能只是觉得，这确实是个愚蠢的行为，但他们却承受了太多的审视。在某种程度上，这并不总是他们的直接过错。所以，你觉得呢？
[00:43:24.070] Or do you feel like you even have a trauma that has caused you to be stuck at a mental age? This is so random, but I just listened to this podcast where Jojo Siwa, the blonde girl who's a dancer from Dance Mom.
[00:43:24.070] 或者你是否觉得自己曾遭受过某种创伤，导致你的心理年龄停滞不前？这有点跑题，但我刚刚听了一个播客，嘉宾是乔乔·西瓦，就是那个在《舞蹈妈妈》节目里跳舞的金发女孩。
[00:43:42.330] She's known for her big bows and stuff. Like she was just on a podcast and I was listening to the episode and she got famous. I think it was around maybe like 14 or slightly younger. Oh wow. And now she's 20 years old.
[00:43:42.330] 她以戴大蝴蝶结之类的而闻名。她之前上过一个播客节目，我当时正在听那期，她就出名了。我记得她当时大概14岁，或者更小一点。哇哦。现在她都20岁了。
[00:43:54.890] She was saying something like, you know, when I was younger, I felt like I was already an old person, like an adult because she's doing all these things. She's literally working and on TV shows and on sets and stuff.
[00:43:54.890] 她说，你知道吗，我年轻的时候，觉得自己已经像个老人家了，像个大人了，因为她做了很多事情。她真的在工作，上电视节目，在片场什么的。
[00:44:08.730] And she knew that what she was getting into with Dance Moms was for the purpose of money and fame. And because she was aware, she felt like a working adult basically. And I feel like to a certain extent, I can relate to that.
[00:44:08.730] 她很清楚自己参加《舞蹈妈妈》是为了赚钱和出名。正因为她明白这一点，她觉得自己基本上就像个上班族一样。某种程度上，我能理解她的感受。
[00:44:26.090] I was obviously not on anything remotely close to Dance Moms. But my parents moved away from the US temporarily when I was like 21, 22. And now they're back in the US but not in the same state as me.
[00:44:26.090] 我当然没上过任何跟《舞蹈妈妈》沾边的节目。不过我父母在我21、22岁的时候暂时搬离了美国。现在他们回到了美国，但不在我所在的州。
[00:44:46.890] And I feel like for an only child who was kind of very close to her parents, it was a little bit traumatic for me. So in a sense, I feel like I'm not stuck in the mental age of 22.
[00:44:46.890] 我觉得作为一个和父母关系很亲密的独生女，这件事对我来说有点创伤。所以从某种意义上说，我觉得我的心理年龄并没有停留在22岁。
[00:44:59.930] Maybe I am when I'm back, like hanging out with my parents. I'm like, oh, I want to be an adult again. But I do kind of feel like sort of like that entitlement I was talking about in the beginning
[00:44:59.930] 也许等我回去之后，比如和父母待在一起的时候，我会这样。我会想，哦，我又想做回大人了。但我确实感觉自己有点像我一开始说的那种自以为是的感觉。
[00:45:09.770] of like, oh, I feel like when I was actually 22, I wasn't able to be this age. So now, you know, say at 22, I felt like 27. And in the last eight years, now I feel like I'm 35. Yeah, I feel some sort of like loss about feeling 22.
[00:45:09.770] 感觉就像，哦，我感觉我22岁的时候，好像还没到这个年纪。所以现在，你知道，比如说22岁的时候，我感觉自己像27岁。而过去八年里，我现在感觉自己像35岁了。是啊，我对22岁的感觉有点失落。
[00:45:29.450] Like I feel like in some ways, I wasn't able to feel 22 to 27 fully. For me, it's probably not really like trauma. But I feel like I had to grow up a little bit quicker in those few years than I would
[00:45:29.450] 感觉在某些方面，我没能完整地体验22岁到27岁的那几年。对我来说，这或许算不上创伤。但我感觉在那几年里，我不得不比我预想的更快地长大。
[00:45:42.890] have had to if my parents had still lived in California near me. So then I feel like sort of weirdness about that time frame. That makes total sense. Yeah, I guess like the theory is only one sided because both of your examples totally
[00:45:42.890] 如果我父母还住在加州我家附近，我就不得不这么做了。所以，我对那段时间感觉有点怪异。这完全说得通。是啊，我觉得这个理论只是片面的，因为你举的两个例子都完全……
[00:45:58.650] show how it can also, you know, like some sort of trauma or like, I don't know, fame or whatever can cause someone to have to actually grow up faster for a while. And then, well, we don't know what happens after that.
[00:45:58.650] 这也表明，某种创伤，或者，我不知道，成名之类的，都可能迫使一个人在一段时间内更快地成长。然后，嗯，我们不知道之后会发生什么。
[00:46:10.650] But like, and I liked your example too, because I feel like when that happened to you, literally pretty much everyone around us, like the people that we were hanging out with a lot,
[00:46:10.650] 但是，我也很喜欢你举的例子，因为我觉得当那种事发生在你身上时，我们周围几乎所有人，比如我们经常一起玩的那些人，都会有同样的感受。
[00:46:23.690] we all still had our parents really close by, because a lot of us are from the Bay Area. And so a lot of our families are here. And you know, as things go, a lot of Bay Area people end up back in the Bay Area. Right.
[00:46:23.690] 我们所有人的父母都还住在附近，因为我们很多人都来自湾区。所以我们很多家人都在这里。你知道，随着时间推移，很多湾区人最终都会回到湾区。没错。
[00:46:38.650] So it was definitely very obvious that you were the first person to, in a sense, like leave the nest, because you're forced out. Like, okay, like not am I'm not leaving the nest. The nest was like taken out from under me. Right? Yeah, that's true.
[00:46:38.650] 所以很明显，从某种意义上说，你是第一个离开“巢穴”的人，因为你是被迫离开的。好吧，不是我主动离开的，而是“巢穴”被人夺走了。对吧？是的，没错。
[00:46:56.650] It's also the loss of choice there that was like, oh. You're like, oh shit, I need to either make a new nest or like, I just fall down like shit. Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:56.650] 失去选择的感觉也让人觉得，哦，糟了，你得要么重新安家，要么就只能像坨屎一样倒下去。对，没错。
[00:47:08.250] I mean, like you were the first person to move, quote unquote, move out from home and like, live in your own apartment with James, which I'm sure was helpful because we were like still pretty young at the time.
[00:47:08.250] 我的意思是，你是第一个搬出去，也就是“搬出家”，和詹姆斯一起住在自己的公寓里的人，这肯定很有帮助，因为我们当时还很年轻。
[00:47:22.970] Just like from there, because you had the first starting point, you've just been like a few steps ahead of the average from our friend groups that we hang out with. Yeah, I think it was definitely very circumstantial.
[00:47:22.970] 就像从那以后，因为你有了最初的起点，你就比我们平时一起玩的那些朋友平均水平高出几步。是的，我认为这绝对是环境使然。
[00:47:35.450] I actually do sometimes think about what would have happened if my parents did stay here, like how my life would have flown. And I think in some ways it's definitely a positive. Like I can be someone who leans on my parents a little bit too much.
[00:47:35.450] 我有时确实会想，如果我父母当初留在这里会怎么样，我的生活会过得多么快。我觉得从某种程度上来说，这绝对是件好事。比如，我可能会有点太依赖父母了。
[00:47:50.490] So, you know, at least having them like removed from the neighborhood or like, you know, not in California, like maybe that made me grow up a little bit because I can be fully immature if I'm like allowed to be.
[00:47:50.490] 所以，你知道，至少让他们离开社区，或者，你知道，不在加州，也许这让我成熟了一些，因为如果允许我这样做，我可能会非常不成熟。
[00:48:05.610] Yeah, but I think I do wish I could have spent those years, especially like COVID and whatnot, like near my family. So that kind of sucks. But you know, hardship and trauma and like all of that is so relative.
[00:48:05.610] 是啊，但我确实希望那些年，尤其是在疫情期间，能和家人待在一起。所以这挺让人难过的。不过你知道，苦难和创伤之类的都是相对的。
[00:48:17.610] Like I feel like to a lot of people, this is very normal of a situation. But just like you said, like a lot of people around us weren't going through the same thing as me at the time.
[00:48:17.610] 我觉得对很多人来说，这种情况很正常。但就像你说的，当时我们周围很多人并没有经历和我一样的事情。
[00:48:25.930] So then I think I especially felt the effects like a little bit harder. Yeah, for sure. It was also kind of a surprise, wasn't it? Like, oh shit, like this is happening. Yeah, I was like, oh, bye. At the time, it was a very cool opportunity.
[00:48:25.930] 所以我觉得我当时受到的影响尤其强烈。没错，确实如此。这也有点出乎我的意料，不是吗？就像，哦，天哪，这事儿真的发生了。是啊，我当时就想，哦，拜拜。但当时，这确实是个很棒的机会。
[00:48:42.170] So it was exciting. But you know, as an only child, I was like, why are they abandoning me? Yeah, I can totally get how it would feel like abandonment. I mean, I actually literally read a Reddit thread once where this it was a mom posting
[00:48:42.170] 所以当时很兴奋。但你知道，作为独生子女，我当时就想，他们为什么要抛弃我？是啊，我完全能体会那种被抛弃的感觉。我之前真的在Reddit上看过一个帖子，是一位妈妈发的……
[00:48:56.010] and she was like, oh my god, like I am trying to move out of state because I have this really cool job opportunity, but I don't want to like I feel kind of guilty leaving my only daughter. I think she was also like college or so.
[00:48:56.010] 她当时就说，天哪，我正打算搬到外州去，因为我找到了一份很棒的工作，但我不想走，我觉得离开我唯一的女儿有点内疚。我想她当时应该也快上大学了吧。
[00:49:10.250] And she was like, I felt really bad. And like she complains that I'm abandoning her, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, OK, this is kind of the natural course of things that like eventually child
[00:49:10.250] 她当时就说，我感觉很糟糕。她抱怨我抛弃了她，等等等等。然后我就想，好吧，这大概就是孩子成长过程中自然而然会发生的事情吧。
[00:49:22.410] and parent will most likely go their separate ways, you know, follow their own career, like do whatever. But because it's like so sudden and like unprepared for it, you're like, oh, fuck, like I'm being abandoned. True.
[00:49:22.410] 父母很可能会分道扬镳，你知道，各自追求自己的事业，做自己想做的事。但因为这一切发生得太突然，毫无准备，你会觉得，哦，糟了，感觉自己被抛弃了。确实如此。
[00:49:37.210] In some ways, it makes you think about like seeing your parents in a slightly more morbid way. Like even now my parents live pretty close. It's like a four hour flight or something. But it's not like I can be in Dallas like half the year every year.
[00:49:37.210] 在某种程度上，这让你对见父母这件事有了更病态的思考。即使现在，我的父母也住得很近，坐飞机也就四个小时左右。但我不可能每年有半年时间都待在达拉斯。
[00:49:55.690] So then every time I see them, I'm always like counting. I'm like, when's the next time I can see them? How many days do we spend together? And eventually I feel like it gets to the point where like every year I'm counting like
[00:49:55.690] 所以每次见到他们，我都会忍不住数日子。我会想，下次什么时候能见到他们？我们能一起待多少天？最后我觉得，每年我都会这样数日子。
[00:50:07.210] how many days did I see my parents this year? And it's not very big. And it's like, you know, I just assume the older we get, it's going to be harder and harder maybe like now I might have more flexibility.
[00:50:07.210] 今年我见了父母几天？不多。你知道，我总觉得年纪越大，见父母就越难，也许现在我时间比较灵活吧。
[00:50:17.770] But who knows when we have kids or, you know, whatever happens in life. So in that aspect, too, I feel like I had to like mentally prepare myself a little bit more or maybe it's just like slightly more logistical planning about seeing my parents.
[00:50:17.770] 但谁知道我们什么时候会生孩子，或者，你知道，人生中还会发生什么事。所以在这方面，我觉得我也需要提前做好心理准备，或者说，需要对去看望父母这件事做一些更周全的安排。
[00:50:34.250] Well, maybe when they retire, you guys can figure something out. That's true. Well, I think at the end of the day, kind of like you said earlier, a lot of this like feeling of age is mental in a sense.
[00:50:34.250] 嗯，也许等他们退休了，你们就能想出办法了。确实如此。嗯，我觉得归根结底，就像你之前说的，很多时候这种衰老的感觉是一种心理作用。
[00:50:49.130] Of course, we can physically feel it eventually, but there's definitely like a mindset and mentality. And I don't think there's a right or wrong to any of this. I think also we're in a pretty transitional time period in our lives.
[00:50:49.130] 当然，我们最终会在生理上感受到它，但这其中肯定存在一种心态和思维方式。而且我认为这一切并没有对错之分。我认为我们也正处于人生的一个过渡时期。
[00:51:03.210] You know, late 20s, we're getting really close to 30. So I'm sure there's a lot of jumblings in our brains. And I'm sure a lot of people who are older than us probably felt something similar.
[00:51:03.210] 你知道，快30岁了，我们离30岁真的越来越近了。所以我相信我们脑子里肯定有很多混乱。而且我相信很多比我们年长的人可能也有类似的感受。
[00:51:15.610] So I guess all we can hope for is that we survive and we find our footing along the way. Thank you, Jisoo, for chatting with me through this very low-key existential crisis topic. It's so true. It was a great conversation for a Sunday afternoon.
[00:51:15.610] 所以我想我们唯一能做的就是祈祷能活下去，并在人生的旅途中找到立足之地。谢谢你，Jisoo，愿意和我聊聊这个略带隐晦的生存危机话题。你说得太对了。这是一个很棒的周日下午谈话。
