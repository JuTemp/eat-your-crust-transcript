[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。
[00:00:02.200] I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:02.200] 我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:16.870] All right.
[00:00:16.870] 好的。
[00:00:17.270] So before we get started today as usual, we have a word but
[00:00:17.270] 所以，像往常一样，在我们今天开始之前，我们先说几句。
[00:00:21.770] we're actually bringing it back to millennial slang.
[00:00:21.770] 我们实际上是在把它带回千禧一代的俚语中。
[00:00:25.870] I think this is millennial slang, right?
[00:00:25.870] 我想这是千禧一代的俚语，对吧？
[00:00:27.670] Yeah, I would agree because it originated with our generation.
[00:00:27.670] 是的，我同意，因为它起源于我们这一代人。
[00:00:31.670] The word is giga chad.
[00:00:31.670] 这个词是“giga chad”。
[00:00:34.370] I think this word is hella funny, but it also kind of has
[00:00:34.370] 我觉得这个词超级搞笑，但它也有点……
[00:00:38.970] even more history than you realize.
[00:00:38.970] 这里蕴藏着比你想象中更丰富的历史。
[00:00:41.970] I think it's an evolved form of Chad.
[00:00:41.970] 我认为它是查德的进化形态。
[00:00:44.670] Chad kind of came up somehow as the ultimate alpha male,
[00:00:44.670] 查德不知怎么就成了典型的阿尔法男，
[00:00:49.770] I guess.
[00:00:49.770] 我猜也是。
[00:00:50.570] I remember the memes that I originally saw for being a Chad
[00:00:50.570] 我还记得我最初看到的关于“查德”的梗图。
[00:00:54.270] was basically, you know, that like meme of the blonde guy
[00:00:54.270] 基本上，你知道，就是那个金发男的梗图
[00:00:57.470] who's like super buff, right?
[00:00:57.470] 谁身材超级棒啊？
[00:00:59.170] And then it's like this dude does whatever successful thing.
[00:00:59.170] 然后，这个人就做了一些成功的事情。
[00:01:02.670] The opposite to it.
[00:01:02.670] 恰恰相反。
[00:01:04.070] It shows like the sad Shiva dog and it's like this one like,
[00:01:04.070] 它看起来就像悲伤的湿婆狗，就像这只一样，
[00:01:08.070] you know, didn't succeed or something.
[00:01:08.070] 你知道，就是没成功之类的。
[00:01:10.370] I feel like the thing I know too is the Chad who is always
[00:01:10.370] 我觉得我所了解的，也是那个总是……的查德
[00:01:13.670] successful does whatever and then the virgin is like the one
[00:01:13.670] 成功人士为所欲为，而处男处女就像是……
[00:01:17.270] who's not successful.
[00:01:17.270] 谁不成功。
[00:01:18.470] So I just remember that spectrum of the Chad and the virgin.
[00:01:18.470] 所以我只记得那种从“查德”到“处男”的极端形象。
[00:01:22.070] Yeah, so that has evolved into giga chad.
[00:01:22.070] 没错，所以它已经演变成了超级猛男。
[00:01:26.070] So pretty self-explanatory that it's just a Chad except like
[00:01:26.070] 所以很明显，他就是个查德，只不过……
[00:01:31.770] giga, a major Chad if you will.
[00:01:31.770] giga，一个十足的查德（Chad，此处为双关，指男性魅力四射、令人敬畏的男性）。
[00:01:36.670] The ultimate Chad.
[00:01:36.670] 终极查德。
[00:01:38.270] Yeah, the ultimate Chad.
[00:01:38.270] 没错，绝对是真男人。
[00:01:39.870] I feel like this meme is also funny because the way I first
[00:01:39.870] 我觉得这个梗也很有趣，因为我最初……
[00:01:43.170] heard about this term is through that one photo.
[00:01:43.170] 我第一次听说这个词，就是通过那张照片。
[00:01:45.870] I guess people who know this term might think of that black
[00:01:45.870] 我想了解这个词的人可能会想到黑色
[00:01:49.470] and white photo of a guy with like the ultimate jawline.
[00:01:49.470] 还有一张白色照片，照片上是一个下巴线条完美的男人。
[00:01:53.670] It's super defined.
[00:01:53.670] 轮廓非常清晰。
[00:01:54.770] His whole body is sculpted.
[00:01:54.770] 他全身线条分明。
[00:01:56.170] You could see like every vein on it pretty much because he's
[00:01:56.170] 因为他身上几乎每一条血管都看得清清楚楚，所以你都能看清他身上的血管。
[00:01:58.970] so buff and I remember seeing a photo of that and seeing the
[00:01:58.970] 他身材真好，我记得看过一张照片，照片上是这样的……
[00:02:02.070] caption.
[00:02:02.070] 标题。
[00:02:02.570] Oh, this guy is giga Chad because not only is he a Chad he's
[00:02:02.570] 哦，这家伙简直就是个超级猛男，因为他不仅是个猛男，他还……
[00:02:06.970] so buff and so alpha looking that he's the giga Chad but it's
[00:02:06.970] 他身材健硕，外表极具男子气概，简直就是超级猛男，但这只是……
[00:02:11.970] funny because I feel like the meme at least the way that I
[00:02:11.970] 有趣的是，我觉得这个梗至少在某种程度上……
[00:02:15.670] have incorporated it into my vocabulary is it's no longer associated
[00:02:15.670] 我已经把它纳入我的词汇表，但它不再与此相关了。
[00:02:20.470] with the picture for me now.
[00:02:20.470] 现在给我看看这张照片。
[00:02:21.870] It's just like when someone is super successful.
[00:02:21.870] 就像有些人非常成功一样。
[00:02:24.370] I just immediately think oh this person is a giga Chad.
[00:02:24.370] 我当时的第一反应就是，哦，这个人肯定是个超级大帅哥。
[00:02:28.470] Do you remember when the last time you might have said giga
[00:02:28.470] 你还记得上次你说“giga”这个词是什么时候吗？
[00:02:31.770] Chad was? I don't I say it so often.
[00:02:31.770] 查德是吗？我不常说这句话。
[00:02:36.370] I don't use it that often.
[00:02:36.370] 我不太常用它。
[00:02:37.870] So I'm like trying to think if there was a time when I used
[00:02:37.870] 所以我就在想，我有没有用过某个东西。
[00:02:40.870] it recently, but I can't quite think of one but to kind of
[00:02:40.870] 最近有过一次，但我一时想不出具体的例子，只能说有点……
[00:02:44.770] go back to the Chad stuff Chad if you want to know the origin
[00:02:44.770] 如果你想了解起源，就回去看看关于查德的东西吧。
[00:02:48.870] of it way back in 2015 someone posted in a bodybuilding forum
[00:02:48.870] 早在2015年，就有人在健美论坛上发帖提到过这件事。
[00:02:54.870] apparently he submitted a post that said going on tinder as
[00:02:54.870] 他显然发布了一条帖子，内容是要去 Tinder 上玩
[00:03:00.270] Chad Thundercock is beyond depressing and it shows his profile
[00:03:00.270] 查德·桑德科克简直令人沮丧至极，这一点在他的个人资料中也有所体现。
[00:03:05.070] because his name was like legitimately Chad Thundercock.
[00:03:05.070] 因为他的名字听起来就像是名副其实的查德·桑德科克。
[00:03:09.970] No way and then I think that's how it kind of blew up because
[00:03:09.970] 不可能，然后我觉得事情就是这么开始闹大的，因为
[00:03:14.370] then someone on tumblr made a Chad Thundercock tumblr and was
[00:03:14.370] 然后 Tumblr 上有人建了个 Chad Thundercock 的 Tumblr 账号，然后……
[00:03:18.370] like dude this fucking name right according to know your meme.
[00:03:18.370] 兄弟，这名字跟Know Your Meme网站上说的完全一样。
[00:03:22.370] That's how Chad kind of blew up and became a thing.
[00:03:22.370] 这就是查德突然走红，成为名人的原因。
[00:03:25.670] Holy shit.
[00:03:25.670] 我的天哪。
[00:03:26.670] That's so funny.
[00:03:26.670] 太搞笑了。
[00:03:28.270] Yeah, Chad Thundercock is a tough name to live up to it also
[00:03:28.270] 是的，查德·桑德科克这个名字确实很难配得上。
[00:03:32.870] says on this know your meme page that the female counterpart
[00:03:32.870] 这个“了解你的梗”页面上说，女性对应角色
[00:03:36.770] for the term Chad is Stacy.
[00:03:36.770] 查德这个角色就是斯泰西。
[00:03:39.870] Oh, you know that kind of makes sense.
[00:03:39.870] 哦，这么说好像也有点道理。
[00:03:42.370] I think Stacy is sort of like a Chad esque name interesting
[00:03:42.370] 我觉得Stacy这个名字有点像Chad那种风格，挺有意思的。
[00:03:46.470] interesting Stacy that just reminds me of like the song Stacy's
[00:03:46.470] 有趣的斯泰西，这让我想起了那首歌《斯泰西的歌》。
[00:03:51.170] mom.
[00:03:51.170] 妈妈。
[00:03:53.170] I guess it's like a more casual way to say the alpha and the
[00:03:53.170] 我猜这就像是比较随意的说法，意思是阿尔法和……
[00:03:56.470] beta like the Chad Thundercock and the virgin no last name.
[00:03:56.470] 像查德·桑德科克和没有姓氏的处男一样的beta。
[00:04:04.570] I feel like this is just one of the most applicable slang terms
[00:04:04.570] 我觉得这算是最贴切的俚语之一了。
[00:04:08.370] giga Chad highly recommend this because it's so like it requires
[00:04:08.370] giga Chad 强烈推荐这个，因为它就像……需要
[00:04:12.870] no explanation.
[00:04:12.870] 没有解释。
[00:04:14.070] Like I feel like even if you have never heard the term giga
[00:04:14.070] 我觉得即使你从未听说过“giga”这个词，
[00:04:16.370] Chad as soon as you hear it in a sentence, you're just like
[00:04:16.370] 查德，你一听到这个词，就好像……
[00:04:18.870] yeah, that makes total sense.
[00:04:18.870] 是的，这完全说得通。
[00:04:21.870] Yeah, and I feel like it can be for any basic thing that no
[00:04:21.870] 是的，我觉得它可以用于任何基本的事情，比如……
[00:04:25.270] one else wants to do like, you know, maybe someone steps up
[00:04:25.270] 如果其他人也想做这件事，比如，你知道，也许有人会挺身而出
[00:04:29.070] and like gets the restaurant reservation.
[00:04:29.070] 就像这样，就能预订到餐厅了。
[00:04:32.170] That's like kind of hard to get then you're like damn.
[00:04:32.170] 那感觉就像很难得到，然后你会想：糟了。
[00:04:34.070] You're such a giga Chad.
[00:04:34.070] 你真是个超级大帅哥。
[00:04:36.270] True or when you hear about someone who's like just doing
[00:04:36.270] 确实如此，或者当你听说有人只是做某事时。
[00:04:39.470] very well for themselves and you maybe haven't heard of that
[00:04:39.470] 他们自己过得很好，你可能没听说过这件事。
[00:04:41.970] person in a while.
[00:04:41.970] 过了一会儿，有人来了。
[00:04:42.970] You're just like, oh my God like he did this and now he works
[00:04:42.970] 你会觉得，我的天哪，他居然做到了，现在他真的在工作
[00:04:45.970] here and he makes X number of dollars like that guy is such
[00:04:45.970] 他在这里赚了X美元，就像那家伙一样
[00:04:49.370] a giga Chad.
[00:04:49.370] 超级查德。
[00:04:51.370] Yeah, it's a funny praise.
[00:04:51.370] 是啊，这夸奖挺有意思的。
[00:04:53.570] I think and it's very light-hearted to if anything it'll make
[00:04:53.570] 我认为，而且它非常轻松愉快，如果有什么影响的话，那就是它会……
[00:04:58.470] everyone around you laugh while also making the person who's
[00:04:58.470] 你周围的人都会笑，同时也会让那个人笑。
[00:05:02.870] being called a giga Chad feel a little good.
[00:05:02.870] 被人叫做“超级猛男”感觉还不错。
[00:05:06.170] That's true.
[00:05:06.170] 这是真的。
[00:05:06.570] So it's like a friendly slang term at least the way that we
[00:05:06.570] 所以它就像一个友好的俚语，至少在我们看来是这样。
[00:05:11.070] use it.
[00:05:11.070] 用它。
[00:05:11.470] I think it's the ultimate high praise.
[00:05:11.470] 我认为这是最高的赞誉。
[00:05:13.970] Also, I think the photos are so funny.
[00:05:13.970] 而且，我觉得这些照片太搞笑了。
[00:05:16.370] If our listeners haven't seen the giga Chad photos, it's super
[00:05:16.370] 如果我们的听众还没看过查德的那些超级帅照，那真是太可惜了。
[00:05:20.070] funny. It always reminds me of you know, fairly odd parents
[00:05:20.070] 真搞笑。它总是让我想起《反斗家族》。
[00:05:23.470] like Crimson Chin.
[00:05:23.470] 就像绯红下巴。
[00:05:24.670] Oh true.
[00:05:24.670] 哦，确实如此。
[00:05:27.370] I never made that connection but that's very accurate actually
[00:05:27.370] 我之前从未想到过这一点，但实际上这非常准确。
[00:05:30.570] giant chin.
[00:05:30.570] 巨大的下巴。
[00:05:32.070] Yeah, the giga Chad photo is truly you'll see the image once
[00:05:32.070] 没错，那张超级查德的照片确实很惊艳，你一看就知道了。
[00:05:35.470] and it'll be forever tattooed onto your brain like you would
[00:05:35.470] 它会像纹身一样永远刻在你的脑海里。
[00:05:38.070] never forget this photo.
[00:05:38.070] 永远不要忘记这张照片。
[00:05:39.670] Yeah, such a funny photo.
[00:05:39.670] 是啊，这张照片真搞笑。
[00:05:42.570] Well speaking of other things that are forever tattooed onto
[00:05:42.570] 说到其他会永远铭刻在身上的东西。
[00:05:46.170] our brains.
[00:05:46.170] 我们的大脑。
[00:05:47.870] A little bit of a rough transition here today.
[00:05:47.870] 今天过渡期稍微有点不顺利。
[00:05:50.770] We wanted to talk about family birthdays.
[00:05:50.770] 我们想聊聊家人的生日。
[00:05:53.370] I think these are something that you also hopefully never
[00:05:53.370] 我觉得这些事你也应该永远不会遇到。
[00:05:56.170] forget and it's something that comes up every year and I
[00:05:56.170] 忘了，这是每年都会发生的事，我
[00:05:59.470] actually feel like this is a very interesting topic because
[00:05:59.470] 我觉得这个话题真的很有趣，因为
[00:06:01.870] each family does birthdays very differently and we kind of
[00:06:01.870] 每个家庭庆祝生日的方式都截然不同，我们有点……
[00:06:07.070] talked about this before starting the recording.
[00:06:07.070] 录音前我们讨论过这个问题。
[00:06:09.470] I think depending on how your family approaches birthdays,
[00:06:09.470] 我认为这取决于你的家庭如何看待生日，
[00:06:12.670] I feel like it definitely affects the way that you approach
[00:06:12.670] 我觉得这肯定会影响你处理事情的方式。
[00:06:15.470] birthdays in your life in your adulthood as well.
[00:06:15.470] 成年后，你生命中的生日也同样重要。
[00:06:18.470] So let's kind of kick this off by going back into our childhood
[00:06:18.470] 那么，让我们先回到童年时光，以此作为开始吧。
[00:06:22.670] and thinking about how did you and your family do birthdays?
[00:06:22.670] 你在想你和你的家人以前是怎么庆祝生日的吗？
[00:06:27.270] Oh my god.
[00:06:27.270] 我的天啊。
[00:06:27.970] So back in the day, I remember pretty clearly that sometimes
[00:06:27.970] 所以，我清楚地记得，以前有时候
[00:06:32.970] I would do my birthday at McDonald's.
[00:06:32.970] 我会在麦当劳过生日。
[00:06:35.470] Whoa.
[00:06:35.470] 哇。
[00:06:36.670] I don't know if it was a thing here but it was kind of a thing
[00:06:36.670] 我不知道这里是不是也这样，但确实有点儿这种风气。
[00:06:39.570] back where I lived.
[00:06:39.570] 回到我住的地方。
[00:06:40.870] We would go to McDonald's and it was you know back when
[00:06:40.870] 我们会去麦当劳，你知道，那是在……
[00:06:43.470] McDonald's still had the like playground areas.
[00:06:43.470] 麦当劳仍然保留着类似的儿童游乐区。
[00:06:47.070] So we would get a few tables and I think it was also good
[00:06:47.070] 所以我们就租了几张桌子，我觉得也挺好的。
[00:06:50.870] because McDonald's is relatively cheap.
[00:06:50.870] 因为麦当劳相对便宜。
[00:06:53.770] At least, you know, it still was back in the day and all the
[00:06:53.770] 至少，你知道，以前是这样，而且所有的一切
[00:06:56.870] kids are happy, you know, we're eating our happy meals and
[00:06:56.870] 孩子们很高兴，你知道，我们正在吃他们的快乐餐。
[00:07:00.070] I think McDonald's used to do something kind of nice.
[00:07:00.070] 我觉得麦当劳以前做过一些挺不错的事。
[00:07:03.670] Like I think they put up a little banner for you or something
[00:07:03.670] 我觉得他们可能给你挂了个小横幅之类的。
[00:07:06.170] like that and then we got cake.
[00:07:06.170] 就这样，然后我们就吃到了蛋糕。
[00:07:08.570] It was like a relatively easy birthday party and it still
[00:07:08.570] 那就像一场相对轻松的生日派对，而且仍然
[00:07:12.970] felt special because it's like you're going somewhere and
[00:07:12.970] 感觉很特别，因为就像要去某个地方一样。
[00:07:15.770] I think it was easy on the parents wallets for the most part.
[00:07:15.770] 我觉得这在很大程度上减轻了父母的经济负担。
[00:07:18.970] Right.
[00:07:18.970] 正确的。
[00:07:19.470] There's things to keep the kids occupied, the like playground
[00:07:19.470] 这里有很多东西可以让孩子们玩，比如游乐场。
[00:07:22.670] area thing.
[00:07:22.670] 区域性事物。
[00:07:23.870] So I remember doing that at least like once or twice when
[00:07:23.870] 所以我记得我至少做过一两次这样的事
[00:07:27.970] I was kindergarten-ish.
[00:07:27.970] 我当时大概是幼儿园小朋友的年纪。
[00:07:30.270] Yeah.
[00:07:30.270] 是的。
[00:07:31.170] Do you remember if you guys invited a bunch of your school
[00:07:31.170] 你还记得你们有没有邀请学校里的很多人吗？
[00:07:34.770] friends or maybe your family friends or was it just you and
[00:07:34.770] 朋友，或者你的家人朋友，或者只有你一个人？
[00:07:37.770] your nuclear family?
[00:07:37.770] 你的核心家庭？
[00:07:39.170] It was like a bunch of my school friends and then like my
[00:07:39.170] 就像我的一群学校朋友，然后就像我的
[00:07:42.670] parents were there.
[00:07:42.670] 父母当时也在场。
[00:07:43.670] I think, I mean they should be.
[00:07:43.670] 我认为，我的意思是，他们应该如此。
[00:07:46.270] That's a nice one actually and I feel like that also speaks
[00:07:46.270] 这确实是个不错的说法，我觉得这也说明了什么。
[00:07:48.770] to what feels very special when you're younger.
[00:07:48.770] 年轻的时候，那种感觉非常特别。
[00:07:51.470] I feel like there's so much more that's like commodified
[00:07:51.470] 我觉得还有很多东西都被商品化了。
[00:07:54.170] now to where birthdays, especially looking at how celebrities
[00:07:54.170] 现在来说说生日，尤其是看看名人是如何庆祝的。
[00:07:58.170] do their kids birthdays have become this like huge thing.
[00:07:58.170] 孩子的生日是不是已经变成了一件大事？
[00:08:00.570] But back then it truly was kind of like, oh, let's go to
[00:08:00.570] 但那时候的感觉真的就像是，哦，我们去……
[00:08:03.270] like the jungle gym nearby or like let's go to this fast
[00:08:03.270] 比如附近的儿童游乐场，或者我们快点去那里
[00:08:06.570] food restaurant and it was like just as special if not even
[00:08:06.570] 这家餐厅的食物也同样特别，甚至可以说是非常特别。
[00:08:09.170] more meaningful.
[00:08:09.170] 更有意义。
[00:08:10.470] Yeah, I think there might have also been a couple times
[00:08:10.470] 是的，我想可能也有过几次。
[00:08:14.370] where it was just at our home and then we invited like a
[00:08:14.370] 当时就在我们家，然后我们像邀请别人一样邀请了
[00:08:18.270] couple of our neighbors slash friends over just like ate
[00:08:18.270] 我们的一些邻居和朋友就像吃东西一样，经常一起玩。
[00:08:22.370] cake together and then like played outside.
[00:08:22.370] 一起做蛋糕，然后像在外面玩耍一样。
[00:08:24.770] So it's like overall like pretty simple stuff.
[00:08:24.770] 所以总的来说，就是一些很简单的事情。
[00:08:28.470] Damn, this is like taking me back.
[00:08:28.470] 该死，这感觉就像回到了过去。
[00:08:30.870] The birthdays that I remember from when I was really young,
[00:08:30.870] 我记得小时候过的那些生日
[00:08:33.570] one of them was my iconic second grade birthday party.
[00:08:33.570] 其中之一就是我那场标志性的二年级生日派对。
[00:08:37.570] My parents actually rented like a bouncy house, a jump house.
[00:08:37.570] 我父母租了一个类似充气城堡、蹦床的游乐设施。
[00:08:41.370] Is that what it was called?
[00:08:41.370] 它就叫这个名字吗？
[00:08:42.470] We had it like inflated up in our front yard and at the
[00:08:42.470] 我们把它像充气玩具一样摆放在前院里，而且……
[00:08:45.770] time I think we lived in like a corner house.
[00:08:45.770] 我记得我们当时住在一栋街角的房子里。
[00:08:48.670] So then a couple of the neighbors kids came by and then
[00:08:48.670] 然后，邻居家的几个孩子就过来了，然后
[00:08:51.770] a bunch of my school friends came and we like jumped in
[00:08:51.770] 我的一群同学来了，我们就像跳进了水里一样。
[00:08:54.770] the jump house for a little bit and then we had pizza at
[00:08:54.770] 我们在充气城堡玩了一会儿，然后吃了披萨。
[00:08:58.170] like a little table set up in our garage and it was just
[00:08:58.170] 就像在我们车库里摆了一张小桌子，它就那样
[00:09:00.470] like this gorgeous sunny day and I think we had some sort
[00:09:00.470] 就像今天这样阳光明媚的好天气，我想我们当时也经历了一些事情。
[00:09:02.570] of you know, like one of those kiddie pools set up in our
[00:09:02.570] 你知道，就像我们这里设置的那种儿童游泳池一样。
[00:09:05.270] backyard as well.
[00:09:05.270] 后院也一样。
[00:09:06.370] So it was super fun and actually a couple years ago, I
[00:09:06.370] 所以那真的超级好玩，实际上几年前，我
[00:09:10.270] was looking back at like old childhood photos at my parents
[00:09:10.270] 我翻看着父母小时候的照片，就像在回忆往事一样。
[00:09:13.170] place and I guess my parents had borrowed a bunch of hanboks
[00:09:13.170] 我猜我父母借了一堆韩服。
[00:09:17.370] like kid hanboks for us.
[00:09:17.370] 就像我们给孩子穿的韩服一样。
[00:09:19.170] So there's like photos of us all in little hanboks and
[00:09:19.170] 所以有很多我们穿着小韩服的照片，
[00:09:22.170] whatnot and of course a bunch of them were not Korean.
[00:09:22.170] 等等等等，当然，其中很多都不是韩国人。
[00:09:24.770] So I think it was like more special and more fun.
[00:09:24.770] 所以我觉得这会更特别，也更有趣。
[00:09:27.270] That sounds so cute.
[00:09:27.270] 听起来好可爱。
[00:09:28.670] Dude, a bunch of little kids running around in hanboks.
[00:09:28.670] 哇，一群小孩穿着韩服到处跑。
[00:09:32.470] And I think another year we did just a normal kind of like
[00:09:32.470] 我想另一年我们也只是做了件很平常的事，比如……
[00:09:36.170] at home party and then some of the closer like family
[00:09:36.170] 在家聚会，然后是一些更亲近的人，比如家人。
[00:09:39.670] friends slept over and actually that's one of the first
[00:09:39.670] 朋友们来我家过夜，实际上那是最早的几次过夜之一。
[00:09:43.370] times where I really remember thinking, oh so my school
[00:09:43.370] 我记得有些时候，我真的会想，哦，原来我的学校
[00:09:46.770] friends are here and some of my family friends are here
[00:09:46.770] 朋友们都在这里，我的一些家人朋友也在这里。
[00:09:49.670] and we're like mixing friend groups.
[00:09:49.670] 我们就像是在混合不同的朋友群体。
[00:09:51.670] So I wonder if it's going to be weird.
[00:09:51.670] 所以我想知道这会不会很奇怪。
[00:09:54.270] Whoa, just crazy.
[00:09:54.270] 哇，简直太疯狂了。
[00:09:55.270] First time.
[00:09:55.270] 第一次。
[00:09:56.570] Yeah, because I remember this was probably whoa.
[00:09:56.570] 是啊，因为我记得这大概当时挺震撼的。
[00:10:01.370] Actually, I wonder if this is the same second grade birthday
[00:10:01.370] 其实，我很好奇这是否是同一个二年级生日。
[00:10:04.370] party because the house that we lived in was before we had
[00:10:04.370] 聚会是因为我们住的房子在我们拥有之前就存在了。
[00:10:08.570] moved into where I was living for third grade.
[00:10:08.570] 搬进了我三年级时住的地方。
[00:10:11.570] So this could have been the same birthday party, but I
[00:10:11.570] 所以这可能也是同一个生日派对，但是
[00:10:13.870] remember being like whoa, are they going to get along or
[00:10:13.870] 记得当时心里想：哇，他们能相处得来吗？
[00:10:16.770] whatever which is crazy to think that I was like seven years
[00:10:16.770] 想想我当时才七年，真是不可思议。
[00:10:19.970] old thinking these thoughts.
[00:10:19.970] 这些想法已经过时了。
[00:10:20.870] Oh my god.
[00:10:20.870] 我的天啊。
[00:10:22.070] And you continued to think them into adulthood.
[00:10:22.070] 你一直带着这些想法直到成年。
[00:10:25.170] Yeah, actually.
[00:10:25.170] 是啊，确实如此。
[00:10:27.370] That's when it started.
[00:10:27.370] 事情就是从那时开始的。
[00:10:28.570] That's your origin story.
[00:10:28.570] 这就是你的身世故事。
[00:10:30.170] Dude, when the anxiety begins.
[00:10:30.170] 兄弟，焦虑感开始的时候。
[00:10:33.970] Do you have any other memorable birthdays you can think of?
[00:10:33.970] 你还能想起其他难忘的生日吗？
[00:10:37.470] I do but I was older in these times, but do you ever remember
[00:10:37.470] 我记得，不过那时候我年纪比较大了，你还记得吗？
[00:10:42.970] going to other kids birthday parties and thinking damn this
[00:10:42.970] 去参加其他孩子的生日派对，心想这真是太糟糕了
[00:10:45.870] is so different.
[00:10:45.870] 完全不一样。
[00:10:47.270] Oh, oh my god.
[00:10:47.270] 我的天哪。
[00:10:49.470] Wait.
[00:10:49.470] 等待。
[00:10:50.870] I don't know at least in my memory.
[00:10:50.870] 至少我记不起来了。
[00:10:53.670] I remember one of my friends dude.
[00:10:53.670] 我记得我一个朋友。
[00:10:57.070] I honestly can't even remember who this was but someone did
[00:10:57.070] 说实话，我甚至都记不清这是谁了，但确实有人这么做了。
[00:11:00.070] a Chuck E. Cheese birthday party and then one year someone
[00:11:00.070] 先是查克·E·奶酪餐厅的生日派对，然后有一年有人……
[00:11:03.370] did like a Dave & Buster's birthday party.
[00:11:03.370] 就像在Dave & Buster's餐厅办生日派对一样。
[00:11:06.270] Dave & Buster's?
[00:11:06.270] Dave & Buster's？
[00:11:07.370] How old were they?
[00:11:07.370] 他们当时多大了？
[00:11:08.070] Maybe that was more like in middle school.
[00:11:08.070] 或许那更像是中学时期的事。
[00:11:09.870] Okay, but another year someone did a birthday party at the
[00:11:09.870] 好吧，但又有一年有人在……举办了生日派对
[00:11:13.470] jungle which is like a jungle gym.
[00:11:13.470] 就像一个丛林健身房。
[00:11:15.570] Oh, okay.
[00:11:15.570] 哦好的。
[00:11:15.870] And I remember all three times I was like, whoa, this is not
[00:11:15.870] 我记得有三次我都觉得，哇，这不对劲
[00:11:18.670] what I would want for my own birthday party.
[00:11:18.670] 如果让我自己办生日派对，我会想要什么？
[00:11:22.470] I was like this is too much chaos.
[00:11:22.470] 我当时就想，这也太混乱了吧。
[00:11:25.070] Oh my god.
[00:11:25.070] 我的天啊。
[00:11:25.670] I feel like Dave & Buster's gets really rowdy.
[00:11:25.670] 我觉得Dave & Buster's餐厅特别吵闹。
[00:11:27.970] I've never been to a Chuck E.
[00:11:27.970] 我从来没去过 Chuck E.
[00:11:28.970] Cheese though.
[00:11:28.970] 不过是奶酪而已。
[00:11:29.970] Whoa, really?
[00:11:29.970] 哇，真的吗？
[00:11:31.070] Chuck E.
[00:11:31.070] 查克·E.
[00:11:31.470] Cheese is like a US only thing.
[00:11:31.470] 奶酪好像是美国特有的东西。
[00:11:33.970] And so by the time I was here we're kind of too old for it
[00:11:33.970] 所以等我来的时候，我们都年纪大了，不太适合做这件事了。
[00:11:37.770] and I was like, what is this Chuck E.
[00:11:37.770] 我当时就想，这是什么 Chuck E.
[00:11:39.470] Cheese thing that I keep seeing?
[00:11:39.470] 我一直看到的那种奶酪？
[00:11:40.970] Remember they did so many TV ads and stuff.
[00:11:40.970] 记得他们拍了很多电视广告之类的东西。
[00:11:43.470] It's just like come here and eat pizza and play games.
[00:11:43.470] 就像来这里吃披萨、玩游戏一样。
[00:11:48.170] And I feel like it was such a cultural reference but really
[00:11:48.170] 我觉得这完全是一种文化典故，但真的
[00:11:50.870] even in my childhood.
[00:11:50.870] 甚至在我童年时期。
[00:11:51.770] I think I've only been like once or twice.
[00:11:51.770] 我想我只去过一两次。
[00:11:54.870] And now it's like gone isn't it?
[00:11:54.870] 现在好像已经消失了，不是吗？
[00:11:56.370] Right.
[00:11:56.370] 正确的。
[00:11:56.970] Out of business.
[00:11:56.970] 已停业。
[00:11:58.070] It's kind of sad even though I've never been.
[00:11:58.070] 虽然我从未去过那里，但还是觉得有点伤感。
[00:12:01.270] But it's so iconic.
[00:12:01.270] 但它太经典了。
[00:12:02.270] I feel like.
[00:12:02.270] 我感觉。
[00:12:03.070] Yeah, I think I've gone to other kids who also did a McDonald's
[00:12:03.070] 是的，我想我之前也去过其他一些去过麦当劳的孩子那里。
[00:12:08.470] birthday before.
[00:12:08.470] 生日之前。
[00:12:10.070] Maybe it was something about our town because like the suburb
[00:12:10.070] 也许是因为我们小镇的某些特质，就像郊区一样。
[00:12:13.670] area that we lived in was pretty small.
[00:12:13.670] 我们居住的地方很小。
[00:12:17.070] So there weren't like a ton of options.
[00:12:17.070] 所以选择并不多。
[00:12:19.470] And so there was definitely a couple of McDonald's birthdays.
[00:12:19.470] 所以，肯定有好几次是在麦当劳庆祝的生日。
[00:12:24.070] Maybe there was also like, you know going to the theaters
[00:12:24.070] 或许还有，你知道，去剧院之类的。
[00:12:27.770] sometimes they have the room that you get to eat your food
[00:12:27.770] 有时他们有足够的空间让你吃饭
[00:12:31.570] in and then all the kids go to the theater after.
[00:12:31.570] 进去之后，所有孩子都去了剧院。
[00:12:34.270] I think I've attended something like that once or twice as
[00:12:34.270] 我想我曾经参加过一两次类似的活动。
[00:12:37.370] well.
[00:12:37.370] 出色地。
[00:12:38.370] I don't know.
[00:12:38.370] 我不知道。
[00:12:38.770] I think that's like all that I'm remembering from like, you
[00:12:38.770] 我想，这就是我对你的全部记忆了。
[00:12:41.970] know, elementary school and kindergarten era.
[00:12:41.970] 我知道，那是小学和幼儿园时代。
[00:12:45.070] Dude.
[00:12:45.070] 老兄。
[00:12:45.770] Yeah, I think we also did kind of like the movie theater
[00:12:45.770] 是的，我觉得我们也挺喜欢电影院的。
[00:12:48.670] arcade and maybe like a movie and pizza in one of those like
[00:12:48.670] 街机厅，或许还可以去看场电影，吃个披萨，就在那种地方。
[00:12:52.070] rooms that you can rent after as well.
[00:12:52.070] 之后你还可以租住这些房间。
[00:12:54.170] Yeah, and it's kind of interesting because now as adults
[00:12:54.170] 是啊，这挺有意思的，因为我们现在都成年了。
[00:12:58.270] I feel like whatever party we go to there's usually some
[00:12:58.270] 我觉得无论我们去参加什么派对，通常都会有一些
[00:13:01.370] sort of alcohol whether it's like wine or hard liquor or
[00:13:01.370] 各种酒精饮料，无论是葡萄酒还是烈酒
[00:13:04.570] whatever.
[00:13:04.570] 任何。
[00:13:04.870] But back then it was truly like candy and soda.
[00:13:04.870] 但那时候，它真的就像糖果和汽水一样。
[00:13:07.570] Dude.
[00:13:07.570] 老兄。
[00:13:07.870] And I remember that shit like we would be hopped up on the
[00:13:07.870] 我还记得那些破事儿，我们当时就像嗑了药一样兴奋。
[00:13:11.570] fucking sugar.
[00:13:11.570] 真他妈的糖。
[00:13:12.970] You know, I didn't think much about it as a child, but now
[00:13:12.970] 你知道，我小时候没怎么想过这个问题，但现在
[00:13:15.370] I'm like, oh my god.
[00:13:15.370] 我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:13:16.570] Yeah, sugar drives children crazy.
[00:13:16.570] 没错，糖会让孩子发疯。
[00:13:19.570] I remember in the beginning we would all be like let's play
[00:13:19.570] 我记得一开始我们都会说，咱们一起玩吧。
[00:13:22.070] a game or two or whatever and then by the end we'd be like
[00:13:22.070] 玩一两局什么的，然后到最后我们就会像这样
[00:13:25.170] screaming, running around being absolute menaces.
[00:13:25.170] 尖叫、四处乱窜，简直是十足的祸害。
[00:13:29.470] We actually like why are there so many screaming children
[00:13:29.470] 我们其实很喜欢看为什么有这么多尖叫的孩子
[00:13:33.170] because they're being fed candy.
[00:13:33.170] 因为他们被喂了糖果。
[00:13:35.670] Oh my god.
[00:13:35.670] 我的天啊。
[00:13:36.470] And to think at that time we didn't know like ourselves,
[00:13:36.470] 想想那时候我们对自己的认知还很模糊，
[00:13:40.270] you know, so we're like no this is just how I am but like
[00:13:40.270] 你知道，所以我们会说，不，我就是这样的人，但是……
[00:13:43.470] actually we're just high on candy like our blood sugar was
[00:13:43.470] 实际上，我们只是因为吃了太多糖果而血糖飙升。
[00:13:47.270] just out of control.
[00:13:47.270] 完全失控了。
[00:13:48.770] Yeah.
[00:13:48.770] 是的。
[00:13:49.670] It's funny too because I guess depending on what kind of
[00:13:49.670] 这很有趣，因为我想这取决于哪种
[00:13:52.470] household you lived in what the like family diet was, you
[00:13:52.470] 你居住的家庭的饮食习惯如何？
[00:13:56.370] know, kids are more exposed to certain things based on their
[00:13:56.370] 要知道，孩子们会因为自身的经历而更容易接触到某些事物。
[00:13:59.070] family culture.
[00:13:59.070] 家庭文化。
[00:14:00.370] So my family didn't drink a ton of soda back then but like
[00:14:00.370] 所以我家那时候并不怎么喝汽水，但是……
[00:14:04.870] pizza and stuff was not like super uncommon like, you know,
[00:14:04.870] 披萨之类的东西并不算特别罕见，你知道的。
[00:14:07.870] we would have it like I wasn't like restricted from it.
[00:14:07.870] 就好像我没有受到任何限制一样。
[00:14:10.670] Whereas other kids I felt like we're having soda every single
[00:14:10.670] 而其他孩子，我觉得我们好像每天都在喝汽水。
[00:14:13.270] day.
[00:14:13.270] 天。
[00:14:13.470] So I feel like some kids got more high than others.
[00:14:13.470] 我觉得有些孩子比其他孩子吸食的毒品更多。
[00:14:16.670] Yeah, I remember like soda was banned in my home usually for
[00:14:16.670] 是啊，我记得我家以前通常是禁止喝汽水的。
[00:14:23.170] kids but only like, you know, if we're going out and I don't
[00:14:23.170] 孩子，但只有像那样，你知道，如果我们出去玩，而我没有孩子的时候才会这样。
[00:14:26.670] know getting fast food or something then it's like, okay,
[00:14:26.670] 我知道，如果吃快餐之类的，那就相当于，好吧，
[00:14:28.770] you can have soda this one time but like we're gonna avoid
[00:14:28.770] 这次你可以喝汽水，但我们还是要避免。
[00:14:31.670] that for the most part but my dad really liked soda.
[00:14:31.670] 大部分情况下是这样，但我爸爸真的很喜欢汽水。
[00:14:35.470] So I would always see him like drinking his Coke and I'm
[00:14:35.470] 所以我总是看到他喝可乐，而我
[00:14:38.770] like dude like that looks so good.
[00:14:38.770] 老兄，这看起来真棒。
[00:14:41.570] When can I drink soda?
[00:14:41.570] 我什么时候可以喝汽水？
[00:14:43.770] Actually now that you mention it.
[00:14:43.770] 你这么一说，确实还有这回事。
[00:14:45.170] I do feel like there was sort of like an ease in process.
[00:14:45.170] 我感觉整个过程似乎比较轻松。
[00:14:48.370] I have like a vague recollection of only being able to drink
[00:14:48.370] 我隐约记得自己当时只能喝水。
[00:14:51.170] Sprite for a long time and then Coke was like the adult drink
[00:14:51.170] 雪碧流行了很长时间，后来可口可乐就成了成年人的饮料。
[00:14:54.770] and then like somewhere in the middle.
[00:14:54.770] 然后就像介于两者之间的某个位置。
[00:14:55.870] It was like Fanta was okay or some shit.
[00:14:55.870] 感觉芬达还不错，或者是什么乱七八糟的东西。
[00:14:58.170] Oh, dude that sounds kind of familiar.
[00:14:58.170] 哦，老兄，这听起来有点耳熟。
[00:15:01.270] Yeah, I think I drank Sprite more.
[00:15:01.270] 是的，我觉得我喝雪碧比较多。
[00:15:03.870] It's probably because Coke has like some caffeine in it.
[00:15:03.870] 可能是因为可乐里含有咖啡因吧。
[00:15:06.870] Yeah, so they're probably like holy shit sugar plus caffeine
[00:15:06.870] 是啊，所以它们可能就像是“我的天哪，全是糖加咖啡因”一样。
[00:15:10.170] like our kid is gonna go crazy.
[00:15:10.170] 我们的孩子感觉都要疯掉了。
[00:15:12.770] Yeah, what's also interesting too to me about going to other
[00:15:12.770] 是的，去其他地方也让我觉得很有意思。
[00:15:17.070] kids birthday parties is I remember even as a kid.
[00:15:17.070] 我小时候就记得孩子们的生日派对。
[00:15:21.970] I was like, oh this person throws like big birthday parties
[00:15:21.970] 我当时就想，哦，这个人很会办大型生日派对啊。
[00:15:25.570] and every year they throw a birthday party.
[00:15:25.570] 他们每年都会举办生日派对。
[00:15:28.270] So one year in elementary school, I must have been like
[00:15:28.270] 所以，小学那一年，我肯定就像……
[00:15:30.870] fourth or fifth grade.
[00:15:30.870] 四年级或五年级。
[00:15:31.870] This one girl invited me to her birthday party and I thought
[00:15:31.870] 有个女孩邀请我去参加她的生日派对，我想……
[00:15:35.070] it was kind of odd even at the time because I had like a
[00:15:35.070] 即使在当时，这也有点奇怪，因为我当时就像……
[00:15:38.370] couple of conversations like we weren't like close friends
[00:15:38.370] 我们聊过几次，但感觉我们不像很亲密的朋友。
[00:15:40.870] or anything.
[00:15:40.870] 或者任何东西。
[00:15:41.470] We just like chatted a couple times and she was like, oh you
[00:15:41.470] 我们只是聊了几次，她就说，哦，你
[00:15:43.370] should come to my birthday party and she had it at a trampoline
[00:15:43.370] 她应该来参加我的生日派对，派对是在蹦床上举行的。
[00:15:47.770] gym.
[00:15:47.770] 健身房。
[00:15:48.870] It was someplace called Sky High.
[00:15:48.870] 那是一个叫“天空之巅”的地方。
[00:15:50.470] I think where the whole thing is like trampoline that just
[00:15:50.470] 我觉得整个过程就像蹦床一样，就那样。
[00:15:53.970] kind of like jump for like hours and you can like jump through
[00:15:53.970] 就像可以连续跳几个小时，而且你可以一直跳下去。
[00:15:56.970] rooms or whatever and I was like, whoa, this is like a different
[00:15:56.970] 房间什么的，我当时就想，哇，这感觉完全不一样。
[00:16:00.870] scale kind of a birthday party and another person that I knew
[00:16:00.870] 规模有点像生日派对，还有我认识的另一个人
[00:16:04.670] through childhood.
[00:16:04.670] 整个童年时期。
[00:16:06.170] I always felt like his mom was very into throwing birthday
[00:16:06.170] 我一直觉得他妈妈很喜欢办生日派对。
[00:16:09.270] parties.
[00:16:09.270] 派对。
[00:16:10.170] So every year he would do like a big birthday thing.
[00:16:10.170] 所以他每年都会举办盛大的生日庆祝活动。
[00:16:13.270] But now that I think about it like looking back, I'm not actually
[00:16:13.270] 但现在回想起来，我其实并不是那样。
[00:16:15.970] sure if he's like a big birthday person.
[00:16:15.970] 如果他是个很重视生日的人，那当然可以。
[00:16:18.270] Like I just felt like his mom was very into throwing him
[00:16:18.270] 我感觉他妈妈好像很喜欢把他扔来扔去。
[00:16:20.370] birthday parties.
[00:16:20.370] 生日派对。
[00:16:21.470] She's like, oh my god, let's throw the best birthday party
[00:16:21.470] 她当时就想，我的天哪，我们一定要办一场最棒的生日派对！
[00:16:23.870] these five-year-olds could want.
[00:16:23.870] 这些五岁的孩子可能会想要什么。
[00:16:25.570] Yeah, and he's like, I'll show up I guess.
[00:16:25.570] 是啊，他当时说，我想我会去的。
[00:16:29.470] She's like you're invited.
[00:16:29.470] 她就像是在邀请你一样。
[00:16:30.970] So you better show up.
[00:16:30.970] 所以你最好到场。
[00:16:32.970] But I feel like a trampoline.
[00:16:32.970] 但我感觉自己像个蹦床。
[00:16:35.370] I don't know what to call them either like a trampoline house.
[00:16:35.370] 我也不知道该怎么称呼它们，比如蹦床屋之类的。
[00:16:38.770] Yeah, but I think I also might have gone to one for a birthday
[00:16:38.770] 是的，但我想我可能也参加过一次生日聚会。
[00:16:42.570] or something as well.
[00:16:42.570] 或者其他什么也行。
[00:16:44.570] I feel like that's a pretty good children's birthday spot because
[00:16:44.570] 我觉得那是个很不错的儿童生日派对地点，因为
[00:16:48.070] it's like, you know, if you fall you just fall into a trampoline
[00:16:48.070] 就像，你知道，如果你摔倒了，你只会摔进蹦床上。
[00:16:51.670] and you get to jump around and use up all your energy.
[00:16:51.670] 你可以到处蹦蹦跳跳，尽情释放你的精力。
[00:16:56.070] So the parents just get to watch and be like nice.
[00:16:56.070] 所以父母只能在一旁看着，然后表示尊重。
[00:16:58.770] They're gonna pass out on the way home.
[00:16:58.770] 他们回家路上肯定会晕倒。
[00:17:00.670] Dude, I have like this distinct memory.
[00:17:00.670] 老兄，我对此记忆犹新。
[00:17:03.670] We were like jumping and like playing tag or whatever having
[00:17:03.670] 我们当时就像在玩捉迷藏之类的游戏，又蹦又跳，到处跑来跑去。
[00:17:06.470] fun like basically wreaking havoc in this trampoline gym and
[00:17:06.470] 乐趣就在于在这个蹦床健身房里肆意破坏。
[00:17:10.170] then we came out and all the moms were just like sitting on
[00:17:10.170] 然后我们出来了，所有的妈妈都像坐在……
[00:17:13.370] a bench making like very awkward and quiet small talk with
[00:17:13.370] 长椅上传来一阵尴尬而安静的闲聊声
[00:17:16.570] each other and I remember thinking like, oh, why aren't they
[00:17:16.570] 他们彼此之间，我记得当时我在想，哦，为什么他们不在一起呢？
[00:17:20.870] jumping?
[00:17:20.870] 跳跃？
[00:17:23.170] I was like, I wonder why they're just like sitting here.
[00:17:23.170] 我当时就想，他们为什么就这么坐在这里呢？
[00:17:24.870] But now that I'm thinking about it, I was like a 28 year old.
[00:17:24.870] 但现在想想，我当时就像个28岁的年轻人。
[00:17:27.270] It's like there's only so much jumping you can do before you're
[00:17:27.270] 就像你跳的次数是有限的，超过一定次数你就……
[00:17:29.870] just like I need to like sit down and have some water.
[00:17:29.870] 就像我需要坐下来喝点水一样。
[00:17:32.370] Yeah.
[00:17:32.370] 是的。
[00:17:33.670] Oh my god, you know what?
[00:17:33.670] 我的天哪，你知道吗？
[00:17:34.570] I think there was also like bowling.
[00:17:34.570] 我想当时应该还有保龄球之类的运动。
[00:17:37.170] Oh, yeah, true.
[00:17:37.170] 哦，是的，没错。
[00:17:38.770] Bowling birthday parties.
[00:17:38.770] 保龄球主题生日派对。
[00:17:40.170] Yeah, pretty good.
[00:17:40.170] 是的，相当不错。
[00:17:41.070] And I feel like that's a very 90s kids thing.
[00:17:41.070] 我觉得这很像90后孩子的想法。
[00:17:44.770] Like I don't know if it happened as much after 2010 or whatever.
[00:17:44.770] 我不知道2010年之后这种情况是否还经常发生。
[00:17:50.370] Yeah, but you know early 2000s bowling parties pretty fun.
[00:17:50.370] 是啊，但你知道，2000 年代初的保龄球派对真的很有趣。
[00:17:54.470] It's true.
[00:17:54.470] 没错。
[00:17:55.270] Do you think all these like activities and stuff that we
[00:17:55.270] 你觉得我们做的这些活动和事情都是这样的吗？
[00:17:57.770] remember for our childhood birthday parties?
[00:17:57.770] 还记得我们小时候的生日派对吗？
[00:18:00.270] Do you ever remember doing something like this for our parents
[00:18:00.270] 你是否还记得曾经为父母做过类似的事情？
[00:18:03.070] birthdays?
[00:18:03.070] 生日？
[00:18:03.870] Dude, not at all.
[00:18:03.870] 兄弟，完全不是。
[00:18:05.670] Yeah.
[00:18:05.670] 是的。
[00:18:06.270] So the thing is I didn't know my parents birthdays for the
[00:18:06.270] 所以问题是，我之前不知道我父母的生日。
[00:18:09.670] longest time.
[00:18:09.670] 最长的时间。
[00:18:10.670] Wait, what?
[00:18:10.670] 等等，什么？
[00:18:11.770] Yeah.
[00:18:11.770] 是的。
[00:18:12.470] So basically one I think they probably told me once or twice
[00:18:12.470] 所以基本上，我想他们可能跟我说过一两次。
[00:18:17.070] but my stupid child brain just kept forgetting it but we never
[00:18:17.070] 但我那愚蠢的童心总是忘记这件事，但我们从来没有
[00:18:21.370] made it a big deal.
[00:18:21.370] 把这件事闹大了。
[00:18:23.070] So I think what happened was I didn't ingrain it into my memory
[00:18:23.070] 所以我觉得问题在于我没有把它牢记在心。
[00:18:26.270] until later.
[00:18:26.270] 稍后再说。
[00:18:27.470] So I would always just kind of forget but like my parents would
[00:18:27.470] 所以我总是会忘记，但我的父母会……
[00:18:30.070] remember each other's birthday, right?
[00:18:30.070] 你们都记得彼此的生日吧？
[00:18:32.070] I think the most we would do is like we would just eat a cake.
[00:18:32.070] 我觉得我们最多也就是吃个蛋糕而已。
[00:18:35.370] That's like kind of it like maybe get takeout or like go out
[00:18:35.370] 大概就是这样，比如叫外卖或者出去吃。
[00:18:38.870] to eat.
[00:18:38.870] 吃。
[00:18:39.770] It was just never a big deal.
[00:18:39.770] 这根本就不是什么大事。
[00:18:41.570] So then later when I got older, I was like dude, I'm such a bad
[00:18:41.570] 所以后来我长大后，我就想，老兄，我真是个坏人
[00:18:45.770] child.
[00:18:45.770] 孩子。
[00:18:46.370] Like how come I don't know their birthdays?
[00:18:46.370] 我怎么会不知道他们的生日呢？
[00:18:49.070] So I started to like commit it to memory more.
[00:18:49.070] 所以我开始更喜欢把它记在脑子里。
[00:18:53.070] I think that started in high school probably.
[00:18:53.070] 我觉得这大概是从高中开始的。
[00:18:56.170] I was like dude, what is wrong with me?
[00:18:56.170] 我当时想，老兄，我到底怎么了？
[00:18:58.970] So do you think your parents made it a big deal for each other
[00:18:58.970] 所以你觉得你父母对彼此来说这件事很重视吗？
[00:19:02.970] or they just like kind of secretly did it without making it
[00:19:02.970] 或者他们只是偷偷摸摸地做了，没有公开。
[00:19:06.270] a huge deal for the family?
[00:19:06.270] 对这个家庭来说是一件大事吗？
[00:19:07.570] Because sometimes it's kind of like, oh, it's not like a family
[00:19:07.570] 因为有时候感觉就像，哦，这不像是一个家庭。
[00:19:10.370] affair, but like the couple, you know takes care of each other
[00:19:10.370] 虽然有婚外情，但就像夫妻一样，你知道他们会互相照顾。
[00:19:13.170] or whatever.
[00:19:13.170] 或者其他什么。
[00:19:14.670] So were you just kind of imitating what your parents were doing
[00:19:14.670] 所以你当时只是在模仿你父母的做法吗？
[00:19:17.770] or was it just like truly as a kid you were like I'm blocking
[00:19:17.770] 或者，就像小时候那样，你真的会想“我要屏蔽”？
[00:19:20.970] this from my mind?
[00:19:20.970] 这是我脑子里想到的吗？
[00:19:23.870] I think it truly was just pretty low-key and I think that might
[00:19:23.870] 我觉得这件事确实很低调，而且我觉得这可能
[00:19:27.670] have been how my parents are used to it as well, you know,
[00:19:27.670] 我的父母也一直习惯了这种方式，你知道的。
[00:19:31.770] small celebration, nothing too crazy and pretty chill.
[00:19:31.770] 小型庆祝活动，没什么特别的，挺轻松的。
[00:19:35.370] But one thing that is interesting is my parents birthdays
[00:19:35.370] 但有一件事很有趣，那就是我父母的生日。
[00:19:39.670] are about three months apart and it's on the same day like
[00:19:39.670] 相隔大约三个月，而且是在同一天。
[00:19:45.470] day of the month.
[00:19:45.470] 每月哪一天。
[00:19:47.270] So I'm like, okay, that's kind of easy to remember.
[00:19:47.270] 所以我就想，好吧，这挺容易记住的。
[00:19:49.170] Like what was I doing when I wasn't remembering?
[00:19:49.170] 比如，我失忆的时候在做什么？
[00:19:52.070] Actually, it's slightly similar for my parents as well where
[00:19:52.070] 事实上，我父母的情况也略有类似。
[00:19:55.370] my mom's birthday is on the 16th and then my dad's is on the
[00:19:55.370] 我妈妈的生日是16号，然后我爸爸的生日是……
[00:19:59.470] 15th, but I feel like because it's one day off I would as a
[00:19:59.470] 15号，但我觉得因为那天休息一天，我应该会……
[00:20:02.870] kid always like mix it up.
[00:20:02.870] 孩子总是喜欢混搭。
[00:20:04.270] Oh, it's mom's birthday on the 16th or the 15th and same for
[00:20:04.270] 哦，妈妈的生日是16号或15号，也一样。
[00:20:07.170] my dad.
[00:20:07.170] 我的爸爸。
[00:20:08.070] Dude.
[00:20:08.070] 老兄。
[00:20:08.370] Okay.
[00:20:08.370] 好的。
[00:20:08.570] Also, yeah, I like what is wrong with our child brains?
[00:20:08.570] 还有，是啊，我也很喜欢“我们孩子的脑子到底出了什么问题？”这个问题。
[00:20:12.570] So my mom and dad's birthday are on the 28th, but for some
[00:20:12.570] 我爸妈的生日都是28号，但对某些人来说……
[00:20:16.770] reason I kept mixing it up with like the 29th or like even
[00:20:16.770] 我一直把它和29号或者其他什么日期搞混，原因就在于此。
[00:20:21.070] the 30th and I was like dude, it's like the end of the month,
[00:20:21.070] 30号那天，我就想，老兄，都快月底了。
[00:20:24.070] but like which day you know?
[00:20:24.070] 但你知道具体是哪一天吗？
[00:20:26.070] Wait, what the fuck?
[00:20:26.070] 等等，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:20:27.770] But it's literally in my mom's email.
[00:20:27.770] 但它确实就在我妈妈的邮件里。
[00:20:31.270] Like 28 is like part of her email.
[00:20:31.270] 就像28是她电子邮件的一部分。
[00:20:34.470] So later I was like dude, the clues were all there.
[00:20:34.470] 所以后来我就想，老兄，线索都在那里。
[00:20:38.070] What was I doing?
[00:20:38.070] 我当时在做什么？
[00:20:40.170] Yeah, dude.
[00:20:40.170] 是啊，兄弟。
[00:20:41.270] Did you ever do the thing where I don't know if you got like
[00:20:41.270] 你有没有做过那种事，我不知道你有没有像那样……
[00:20:44.470] gifts for your parents, but at a young age, it's like you have
[00:20:44.470] 给父母的礼物，但年纪轻轻的时候，就好像你已经……
[00:20:47.370] no income and your like life savings are like $30 or some
[00:20:47.370] 没有收入，你的毕生积蓄大概只有30美元左右。
[00:20:50.970] shit.
[00:20:50.970] 拉屎。
[00:20:51.770] So then I would always get my parents coupons and I remember
[00:20:51.770] 所以那时候我总是会拿到父母的优惠券，我记得
[00:20:54.670] my parents would never redeem it and after a certain year,
[00:20:54.670] 我的父母永远不会兑换它，一年后，
[00:20:58.270] I was like, is it a bad idea to make them coupon?
[00:20:58.270] 我当时就在想，把优惠券做成促销品是不是个坏主意？
[00:21:00.570] Like should I stop doing this?
[00:21:00.570] 我应该停止这样做吗？
[00:21:03.170] But my dad would always get my mom something and same for
[00:21:03.170] 但我爸爸总会给我妈妈买东西，反之亦然。
[00:21:05.970] my mom for my dad.
[00:21:05.970] 我妈妈为我爸爸。
[00:21:07.470] So then I would always like sign the card that they bought
[00:21:07.470] 所以，我总是喜欢在他们买的卡片上签名。
[00:21:10.170] and it would be just like me tacking my name on to whatever
[00:21:10.170] 这就像我把自己的名字加到任何东西上一样。
[00:21:13.070] gift my parents were getting each other.
[00:21:13.070] 这是我父母互赠的礼物。
[00:21:14.670] Freeloader.
[00:21:14.670] 蹭吃蹭喝的人。
[00:21:15.570] Yeah, I'm a leech.
[00:21:15.570] 没错，我就是个寄生虫。
[00:21:19.170] Damn.
[00:21:19.170] 该死。
[00:21:19.570] What kind of coupons did you make for them?
[00:21:19.570] 你为他们制作了哪些类型的优惠券？
[00:21:21.870] It was like, oh free like shoulder massage, free hug or use
[00:21:21.870] 感觉就像，哦，免费的，比如肩部按摩、免费拥抱或使用
[00:21:26.670] this coupon and I'll clean my room which they like never
[00:21:26.670] 有了这张优惠券，我就会打扫我的房间，他们从来不会打扫。
[00:21:30.470] redeemed it.
[00:21:30.470] 已赎回。
[00:21:31.070] And honestly if they did redeem it, I'm not sure if I would
[00:21:31.070] 说实话，就算他们真的赎罪了，我也不确定我是否会……
[00:21:33.670] actually do it.
[00:21:33.670] 付诸行动。
[00:21:34.270] Oh, maybe they knew.
[00:21:34.270] 哦，也许他们知道。
[00:21:37.270] They're like these are empty promises.
[00:21:37.270] 他们说这些都是空头支票。
[00:21:39.570] They knew it would be too stressful.
[00:21:39.570] 他们知道这样做压力太大。
[00:21:41.170] They'd be like, oh she'll stress about you know the task
[00:21:41.170] 他们会说，哦，她会因为这项任务而感到压力很大。
[00:21:44.570] at hand, but it's fine.
[00:21:44.570] 虽然手头没有，但没关系。
[00:21:47.570] True.
[00:21:47.570] 真的。
[00:21:48.570] I did not really give my parents gifts, but I did occasionally
[00:21:48.570] 我其实很少送父母礼物，但偶尔也会送。
[00:21:54.870] for like Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[00:21:54.870] 例如母亲节和父亲节。
[00:21:58.570] Dude.
[00:21:58.570] 老兄。
[00:21:58.870] Okay, you know what?
[00:21:58.870] 好吧，你知道吗？
[00:21:59.970] Maybe like when I was really young, I didn't think my parents
[00:21:59.970] 也许就像我小时候那样，我没想过我的父母
[00:22:03.270] had birthdays and I just thought it was like Mother's Day
[00:22:03.270] 我过生日的时候，就觉得这跟母亲节差不多。
[00:22:05.370] and Father's Day.
[00:22:05.370] 还有父亲节。
[00:22:06.270] Whoa.
[00:22:06.270] 哇。
[00:22:06.870] Oh like that Trumps or like it takes precedence over their
[00:22:06.870] 哦，就像特朗普那样，或者说它比他们的更重要
[00:22:10.370] birthdays now.
[00:22:10.370] 现在过生日了。
[00:22:11.270] Yeah, just their role as parents.
[00:22:11.270] 是的，他们只是扮演父母的角色。
[00:22:14.470] Yeah, because like at school they always make you make a
[00:22:14.470] 是啊，因为就像在学校里，他们总是让你做一个
[00:22:18.170] card think about Mother's Day and Father's Day, but I guess
[00:22:18.170] 想到母亲节和父亲节的贺卡，但我猜
[00:22:22.670] because it was so ingrained in me from school, but like not
[00:22:22.670] 因为这种观念从小就在我耳边根深蒂固，但又不像以前那样了。
[00:22:26.470] their birthdays, you know, because they don't know when your
[00:22:26.470] 你知道，他们的生日，因为他们不知道你的生日是什么时候
[00:22:28.570] parents birthdays are.
[00:22:28.570] 父母的生日是。
[00:22:29.970] So to me I was like, oh then Mother's Day and Father's Day
[00:22:29.970] 所以当时我就想，哦，还有母亲节和父亲节呢。
[00:22:32.470] must be like the ultimate celebration.
[00:22:32.470] 这简直就是一场盛大的庆典。
[00:22:34.870] That's kind of interesting actually.
[00:22:34.870] 这其实挺有意思的。
[00:22:36.270] I guess it's sort of like the concept of once you get married
[00:22:36.270] 我想这有点像结婚后那种感觉。
[00:22:38.970] your wedding anniversary probably Trumps your like dating
[00:22:38.970] 你的结婚纪念日可能比你喜欢约会更重要
[00:22:41.870] anniversary or whatever.
[00:22:41.870] 周年纪念日或其他什么日子。
[00:22:43.870] For me, my mom's birthday is like almost identical to Mother's
[00:22:43.870] 对我来说，我妈妈的生日几乎和母亲节一模一样。
[00:22:47.170] Day.
[00:22:47.170] 天。
[00:22:47.570] It's usually no more than like seven days off and then my dad's
[00:22:47.570] 通常最多也就七天假期，然后我爸就……
[00:22:51.470] birthday is very close to Chuseok which is like a huge holiday
[00:22:51.470] 生日离中秋节很近，中秋节就像一个盛大的节日。
[00:22:55.270] in Korea.
[00:22:55.270] 在韩国。
[00:22:56.170] So I always felt like we were coupling up their birthdays with
[00:22:56.170] 所以我一直觉得我们把他们的生日和……联系在一起了
[00:22:59.170] like, you know, whatever holiday was close.
[00:22:59.170] 比如，你知道的，临近的节日。
[00:23:01.870] Yeah.
[00:23:01.870] 是的。
[00:23:02.470] So I just remember thinking like oh, I'm so lucky.
[00:23:02.470] 所以我记得当时我就想，哦，我太幸运了。
[00:23:04.670] I have an August birthday because there's no holiday in
[00:23:04.670] 我的生日在八月，因为八月没有假日。
[00:23:07.270] August.
[00:23:07.270] 八月。
[00:23:08.370] Oh my god.
[00:23:08.370] 我的天啊。
[00:23:08.970] But one time speaking of gifts and stuff.
[00:23:08.970] 但有一次谈到礼物之类的事情。
[00:23:12.170] I did get my dad a gift.
[00:23:12.170] 我确实给爸爸准备了一份礼物。
[00:23:15.570] It was like a watch because I noticed he was kind of interested
[00:23:15.570] 就像看表一样，因为我注意到他似乎挺感兴趣的。
[00:23:20.070] in watches for a hot second.
[00:23:20.070] 在手表行业，只短暂地流行过一秒钟。
[00:23:22.670] So I bought this like random watch just like a cheap one.
[00:23:22.670] 所以我随便买了一块手表，就是那种很便宜的手表。
[00:23:25.770] I think it was like 20 bucks or something, but it looked nice
[00:23:25.770] 我记得好像是20美元左右，不过看起来不错。
[00:23:28.270] one of those, you know off of eBay and then I gave it to him
[00:23:28.270] 就是那种，你知道，从eBay上买的，然后我就把它给了他。
[00:23:32.370] well, and then he was like, thanks for the gift, but you should
[00:23:32.370] 然后他就说，谢谢你的礼物，但是你应该
[00:23:35.270] save your money for yourself.
[00:23:35.270] 把钱省下来给自己用。
[00:23:36.970] Oh my god.
[00:23:36.970] 我的天啊。
[00:23:38.070] I have heard that line from my parents so many times.
[00:23:38.070] 我从父母那里听过这句话无数遍了。
[00:23:41.270] And I was like, oh, okay, and then I never got him a gift
[00:23:41.270] 我当时就想，哦，好吧，然后我就再也没给他买礼物了。
[00:23:44.470] again.
[00:23:44.470] 再次。
[00:23:46.670] You're like the only gift you're getting from now on is love.
[00:23:46.670] 你就像是从今往后唯一能得到的礼物，那就是爱。
[00:23:50.970] Yeah, I've heard that line so many times for my parents and
[00:23:50.970] 是的，我听过太多次这句话了，都是针对我父母的。
[00:23:53.570] now looking back.
[00:23:53.570] 现在回想起来。
[00:23:54.870] It's probably so weird for them because like, you know how
[00:23:54.870] 对他们来说这可能很奇怪，因为你知道……
[00:23:58.370] we used to get allowance from our parents.
[00:23:58.370] 我们以前会从父母那里拿到零花钱。
[00:24:01.270] So then they know all the gifts that you're getting them
[00:24:01.270] 这样他们就知道你要送他们哪些礼物了。
[00:24:03.870] is just like their own money getting returned to them basically
[00:24:03.870] 基本上就好比他们拿回了自己的钱一样。
[00:24:07.370] but through the form of a gift that they might not have even
[00:24:07.370] 但通过一份他们可能原本没有的礼物的形式。
[00:24:10.770] wanted like, you know how when you're a kid, I feel like your
[00:24:10.770] 就像，你知道，当你还是个孩子的时候，我觉得你的
[00:24:13.770] budget is so constrained.
[00:24:13.770] 预算非常有限。
[00:24:16.070] Yeah, like the things that you can afford are like very very
[00:24:16.070] 是啊，你能买得起的东西都非常非常少。
[00:24:19.070] cheap. Our parents are probably like bro.
[00:24:19.070] 便宜。我们父母可能会说：兄弟。
[00:24:21.070] I don't want this like duct tape wallet.
[00:24:21.070] 我不想要那种像用胶带粘起来的钱包。
[00:24:22.870] Dude, $10 or whatever.
[00:24:22.870] 兄弟，10美元也行。
[00:24:25.370] Yeah.
[00:24:25.370] 是的。
[00:24:26.270] Oh my god.
[00:24:26.270] 我的天啊。
[00:24:27.170] I just thought of something really cursed that I used to do
[00:24:27.170] 我突然想起我以前做过的一件非常邪恶的事。
[00:24:29.570] what I used to dig through the cabinets of like our house and
[00:24:29.570] 我以前经常翻遍我们家的橱柜，
[00:24:34.470] find old stuff and like wrap it and give it to my parents as a
[00:24:34.470] 找些旧东西，包装好，送给我的父母。
[00:24:38.470] gift.
[00:24:38.470] 礼物。
[00:24:39.470] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:24:39.470] 等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:24:40.770] What was their reaction?
[00:24:40.770] 他们的反应是什么？
[00:24:42.570] They were just like, oh, thank you.
[00:24:42.570] 他们只是说，哦，谢谢。
[00:24:44.470] This is so sweet.
[00:24:44.470] 太甜蜜了。
[00:24:45.470] Like they wouldn't be like wait, is this from like the office
[00:24:45.470] 他们不会像在说“等等，这是《办公室》里的吗？”
[00:24:48.470] or whatever.
[00:24:48.470] 或者其他什么。
[00:24:49.570] I remember being like, oh I should wrap them like this.
[00:24:49.570] 我记得当时我想，哦，我应该这样包起来。
[00:24:52.870] I mean it was like stuff that was either unused or like still
[00:24:52.870] 我的意思是，那些东西要么没用过，要么就像……
[00:24:56.770] in their original packaging.
[00:24:56.770] 原包装。
[00:24:58.470] So it's like new still right and then I would just wrap it but
[00:24:58.470] 所以它还跟新的一样，对吧？然后我就把它包起来。
[00:25:01.970] it's like our parents knew like my parents knew.
[00:25:01.970] 就好像我们的父母和我父母一样，早就知道了。
[00:25:05.870] They're like wow so clever.
[00:25:05.870] 他们惊叹道：“哇，真聪明！”
[00:25:09.570] They're like what is wrong with this child?
[00:25:09.570] 他们会想：这孩子怎么了？
[00:25:11.870] I think also like maybe my parents are weird about receiving
[00:25:11.870] 我觉得可能我父母在接收方面有点奇怪。
[00:25:16.470] gifts.
[00:25:16.470] 礼物。
[00:25:17.270] Oh really?
[00:25:17.270] 哦真的吗？
[00:25:18.570] Yeah, because I did give them a gift a couple Christmases ago
[00:25:18.570] 是的，因为几年前的圣诞节我确实送过他们礼物。
[00:25:23.970] and they like don't even use them.
[00:25:23.970] 他们好像根本不用它们。
[00:25:26.270] Oh no, but they were like very simple gifts.
[00:25:26.270] 哦不，它们只是些很简单的礼物。
[00:25:29.970] So I got my mom like this coach card holder and then I got my
[00:25:29.970] 所以我给我妈妈买了这款蔻驰卡包，然后我又买了我的
[00:25:34.970] dad this leather cast iron handle that you can put on so
[00:25:34.970] 爸爸，这个皮革铸铁把手可以装上去。
[00:25:38.970] you don't burn yourself and then my mom she's like wow,
[00:25:38.970] 你没把自己烫伤，然后我妈就惊叹道：“哇！”
[00:25:44.070] thanks.
[00:25:44.070] 谢谢。
[00:25:44.670] And then she puts her cards in a ziploc bag and I'm like why
[00:25:44.670] 然后她把卡片放进一个密封袋里，我就问她为什么。
[00:25:50.770] she's like so I look poor and no one will steal from me and
[00:25:50.770] 她就像在说，这样我看起来很穷，就不会有人偷我的东西了。
[00:25:53.870] I'm like, holy shit.
[00:25:53.870] 我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:25:55.170] That's so funny.
[00:25:55.170] 太搞笑了。
[00:25:56.970] And she's like also it's waterproof in the zip lock bag
[00:25:56.970] 她还说，放在密封袋里也是防水的。
[00:25:59.570] and I'm like dude unrefutable.
[00:25:59.570] 我当时就想，老兄，这无可辩驳。
[00:26:01.970] That's actually facts.
[00:26:01.970] 这的确是事实。
[00:26:04.170] I was just like, oh my God and then for the the like cast iron
[00:26:04.170] 我当时就想，我的天哪，然后就像铸铁一样。
[00:26:09.170] handle thing like it wasn't being used for a while.
[00:26:09.170] 把东西处理得好像很久没用过一样。
[00:26:11.970] It was just like in the kitchen drawer occasionally.
[00:26:11.970] 就像偶尔在厨房抽屉里看到的那样。
[00:26:14.770] It gets pulled out to use to get used and I was like, okay
[00:26:14.770] 它被拿出来用，我就想，好吧。
[00:26:17.770] nice.
[00:26:17.770] 好的。
[00:26:18.170] I guess this one's getting a little bit of use.
[00:26:18.170] 看来这东西还是有点用处的。
[00:26:21.170] I feel like that's so funny because my parents approach gifts
[00:26:21.170] 我觉得这太搞笑了，因为我父母对待礼物的态度很特别。
[00:26:24.270] in such a different way like my parents quirk about gifts sort
[00:26:24.270] 以一种截然不同的方式，就像我父母对礼物的怪癖一样。
[00:26:27.770] of is that they'll always make it a point to like use it when
[00:26:27.770] 也就是说，他们总是会想方设法使用它。
[00:26:31.670] we're in there.
[00:26:31.670] 我们进去了。
[00:26:32.170] Like I don't know if I'm not there like if they're actually
[00:26:32.170] 我不知道我是否真的在那里，也不知道他们是否真的在那里。
[00:26:34.770] using it or not, but when me and James go over my dad is
[00:26:34.770] 用不用都无所谓，但我和詹姆斯过去的时候，我爸爸是
[00:26:37.470] always like up remember this sweater like you got it for me.
[00:26:37.470] 我总是记得这件毛衣，就像是你送给我的一样。
[00:26:40.970] I'm like, oh, thanks for wearing it.
[00:26:40.970] 我心想，哦，谢谢你戴着它。
[00:26:44.470] But I feel like the thing about my parents is one whatever
[00:26:44.470] 但我感觉我父母身上有一点，不管怎样
[00:26:49.370] I buy for my dad.
[00:26:49.370] 我买来送给我爸爸。
[00:26:50.470] I feel like it's an idea from my mom or like sometimes I'll
[00:26:50.470] 我觉得这是我妈妈的想法，或者有时候我会……
[00:26:53.270] think of things like oh my I think dad needs this or whatever
[00:26:53.270] 想想诸如“哦，天哪，我觉得爸爸需要这个”之类的事情
[00:26:55.970] but my mom is always like, oh, yeah, you should get your dad
[00:26:55.970] 但我妈总是说，哦，对啊，你应该去找你爸爸。
[00:26:58.570] this sweater or like a scarf or whatever or some sort of idea.
[00:26:58.570] 这件毛衣，或者围巾之类的，或者其他什么，总之就是个不错的想法。
[00:27:03.070] So that's always been helpful.
[00:27:03.070] 所以这一直都很有帮助。
[00:27:05.470] She knows what he wants.
[00:27:05.470] 她知道他想要什么。
[00:27:07.070] Yeah, dude.
[00:27:07.070] 是啊，兄弟。
[00:27:07.670] She's got all the Intel and then my mom is kind of interesting
[00:27:07.670] 她掌握着所有情报，而我妈妈则挺有意思的。
[00:27:11.770] to shop for because she'll like make these jokes about what
[00:27:11.770] 去买礼物，因为她会喜欢开这些玩笑，比如……
[00:27:14.570] she wants.
[00:27:14.570] 她想要。
[00:27:15.870] So for Christmas I called her and I was like, hey James and
[00:27:15.870] 所以圣诞节的时候我给她打电话，我说，嘿，詹姆斯，
[00:27:18.570] I are going to go grab some gifts for you at the mall.
[00:27:18.570] 我打算去商场给你买些礼物。
[00:27:20.970] Like what do you want?
[00:27:20.970] 你想要什么？
[00:27:21.870] She's like I want something shiny and glamorous.
[00:27:21.870] 她好像想要一些闪亮迷人的东西。
[00:27:24.870] I was like, this is like even less helpful than just being
[00:27:24.870] 我当时就想，这甚至比仅仅存在还要没用。
[00:27:28.070] like, I don't know, get whatever.
[00:27:28.070] 比如，我也不知道，随便什么都行。
[00:27:29.770] It's like so pointed and specific that I'm like now I have
[00:27:29.770] 它如此尖锐具体，以至于我现在感觉自己……
[00:27:32.470] to find look at everything that's shiny in this mall.
[00:27:32.470] 看看这家商场里所有闪闪发光的东西。
[00:27:37.470] Yeah, my guess is maybe it's how they were raised.
[00:27:37.470] 是的，我猜可能是因为他们从小接受的教育方式。
[00:27:42.870] Okay, I have a theory here perhaps in China, you know communism
[00:27:42.870] 好吧，我这里有个理论，或许在中国，你知道的，共产主义
[00:27:49.470] so they didn't really get gifts in the beginning of their
[00:27:49.470] 所以他们在一开始并没有真正收到礼物。
[00:27:52.070] life because you know, everyone gets the same stuff though.
[00:27:52.070] 因为你知道，每个人都得到同样的东西。
[00:27:55.970] Maybe that like has evolved.
[00:27:55.970] 或许这种喜好已经发生了变化。
[00:27:57.470] So now they're like kind of awkward about receiving gifts
[00:27:57.470] 所以现在他们收礼物的时候有点不好意思了。
[00:28:00.170] because they're just used to like, oh if I want this then
[00:28:00.170] 因为他们习惯了这样想：哦，如果我想要这个，那么
[00:28:02.570] I'll buy it.
[00:28:02.570] 我买。
[00:28:03.970] Now that I have the capability to.
[00:28:03.970] 既然我现在有能力这样做。
[00:28:06.270] That's true.
[00:28:06.270] 这是真的。
[00:28:07.070] I guess there's also a bunch of other stuff that I could think
[00:28:07.070] 我想，我还能想到其他一些事情。
[00:28:09.770] of too where like families were bigger back then.
[00:28:09.770] 那时候家庭规模也比较大。
[00:28:13.170] So maybe one birthday out of like six or seven people in
[00:28:13.170] 所以，大概每六七个人中就有一个人过生日吧。
[00:28:16.670] the family not as big of a deal or I think Asia in general
[00:28:16.670] 家庭因素并没有那么重要，或者说，我认为在亚洲整体上都是如此。
[00:28:20.770] was a little bit more poor.
[00:28:20.770] 稍微穷一些。
[00:28:22.270] So I know my parents didn't grow up with like a ton of money.
[00:28:22.270] 所以我知道我父母小时候家境并不富裕。
[00:28:25.570] Yeah, I guess it's kind of sweet that they didn't make their
[00:28:25.570] 是啊，我觉得他们没把……做得这么好，也挺让人欣慰的。
[00:28:28.170] own birthdays like a huge deal, but they still threw birthday
[00:28:28.170] 他们把自己的生日看得非常重要，但他们仍然会庆祝生日。
[00:28:30.870] parties for us and try to make our birthdays a bigger deal
[00:28:30.870] 为我们举办派对，努力让我们的生日更加隆重。
[00:28:34.370] than it was for them.
[00:28:34.370] 对他们来说，情况就截然不同了。
[00:28:35.570] Definitely.
[00:28:35.570] 确实。
[00:28:36.970] Do you remember what you did in like junior high and high
[00:28:36.970] 你还记得你在初中和高中都做了些什么吗？
[00:28:40.870] school because at that point we're like sort of functioning
[00:28:40.870] 上学是因为到了那个时候我们基本上还能正常运转。
[00:28:44.270] humans and we can make decisions sometimes.
[00:28:44.270] 人类，我们有时也能做出决定。
[00:28:48.670] So did you go to your parents and ask like, oh my God, like
[00:28:48.670] 所以你是不是跑去问你父母，就像，我的天哪，就像
[00:28:51.870] I want to do this for my birthday or were you kind of just
[00:28:51.870] 我想在生日时做这件事，或者你只是……
[00:28:55.370] like whatever?
[00:28:55.370] 比如什么？
[00:28:57.170] I don't know why but I low-key have zero recollection of what
[00:28:57.170] 我不知道为什么，但我对之前发生的事完全没有印象。
[00:28:59.970] I did for my birthdays in middle school, but high school
[00:28:59.970] 我中学时过生日会这样做，但高中时就不这样做了。
[00:29:02.770] birthdays actually my parents were still fairly involved and
[00:29:02.770] 事实上，我的父母仍然相当积极地参与过我的生日庆祝活动。
[00:29:05.570] they still threw me birthday parties.
[00:29:05.570] 他们还是会给我办生日派对。
[00:29:08.270] So the big one that I remember was probably like my 15th
[00:29:08.270] 所以我记得最清楚的一次大概是我的第15次。
[00:29:11.170] birthday, I believe where my parents put up like a tent in
[00:29:11.170] 生日那天，我相信是我父母搭起帐篷的地方
[00:29:16.070] my backyard and then we put a bunch of sleeping bags in there
[00:29:16.070] 我家后院，然后我们在那里放了很多睡袋。
[00:29:19.470] and a bunch of my friends came over.
[00:29:19.470] 我的一群朋友都过来了。
[00:29:21.270] We didn't actually end up sleeping in that tent because we
[00:29:21.270] 我们最终并没有睡在那个帐篷里，因为我们
[00:29:23.570] stayed up playing Just Dance all night.
[00:29:23.570] 熬夜玩了一整天的《舞力全开》。
[00:29:26.470] Oh my God, set up like a TV in the garage and like a sofa and
[00:29:26.470] 我的天哪，把它布置得像车库里的电视机和沙发一样。
[00:29:30.070] we literally just played Just Dance for hours and hours and
[00:29:30.070] 我们真的玩了好几个小时的《舞力全开》，
[00:29:34.670] at 5 a.m.
[00:29:34.670] 凌晨5点
[00:29:35.470] We crawled into the sleeping bag and took like a 10-minute
[00:29:35.470] 我们钻进睡袋，大概过了10分钟。
[00:29:38.170] nap and then everyone left at like 7 or 8 a.m.
[00:29:38.170] 午睡后，大家大概早上七八点就都离开了。
[00:29:41.670] It's crazy.
[00:29:41.670] 太疯狂了。
[00:29:43.270] The amount of energy.
[00:29:43.270] 能量总量。
[00:29:44.770] Holy shit.
[00:29:44.770] 我的天哪。
[00:29:45.870] Yeah, dude.
[00:29:45.870] 是啊，兄弟。
[00:29:46.870] That was wild.
[00:29:46.870] 真是太疯狂了。
[00:29:47.870] That's so sweet though.
[00:29:47.870] 真是太好了。
[00:29:49.170] Yeah, I was like it's sweet that they still cared so much
[00:29:49.170] 是啊，我就觉得他们还这么关心我，真暖心。
[00:29:52.170] to be like, oh you should do this thing.
[00:29:52.170] 就像是说，哦，你应该做这件事。
[00:29:53.770] We'll pitch a tent whatever.
[00:29:53.770] 不管怎样，我们都会搭帐篷。
[00:29:55.770] It's just nice to have them still be involved but not necessarily
[00:29:55.770] 让他们继续参与其中固然很好，但也不一定非要如此。
[00:30:00.070] like helicoptering or like chaperoning the event.
[00:30:00.070] 比如乘坐直升机或陪同参加活动。
[00:30:03.670] Yeah, and then I think the other big one that I can recall
[00:30:03.670] 是的，然后我想起来还有另一件大事。
[00:30:07.270] was probably like my 16th or 17th birthday, maybe my 16th,
[00:30:07.270] 大概是我16岁或17岁生日，也许是16岁。
[00:30:11.470] but we all went out to dinner at Santana Row which I feel
[00:30:11.470] 但我们都去了 Santana Row 吃晚饭，我觉得
[00:30:14.570] like is such a like Bay Area classic and we all wore like
[00:30:14.570] 就像湾区经典款一样，我们都穿了。
[00:30:18.270] our nicest dresses and wore heels and that was like the time
[00:30:18.270] 我们穿着最漂亮的裙子和高跟鞋，那就像……
[00:30:23.070] to really dress up.
[00:30:23.070] 盛装打扮。
[00:30:24.670] Wait, we totally did something like that too for someone's
[00:30:24.670] 等等，我们也为别人做过类似的事情……
[00:30:28.070] 16th birthday like the exact same thing.
[00:30:28.070] 16岁生日也一样。
[00:30:30.070] We went to Santana Row.
[00:30:30.070] 我们去了圣塔纳街。
[00:30:31.870] We went to what Maggiano's I think and then yeah, we all
[00:30:31.870] 我们去了Maggiano's，我想是吧，然后，是的，我们都
[00:30:35.770] like dressed up.
[00:30:35.770] 就像盛装打扮一样。
[00:30:37.370] Oh my god, you're bringing back memories.
[00:30:37.370] 我的天哪，你勾起了我的回忆。
[00:30:39.370] Dude.
[00:30:39.370] 老兄。
[00:30:40.470] So nowadays when I go to Santana Row, I guess I haven't
[00:30:40.470] 所以现在我去圣塔纳街的时候，我想我还没有
[00:30:42.570] gone for like a hangout in a very long time, but I'm not
[00:30:42.570] 好久没出去玩了，但我不是
[00:30:45.270] really like dressing up right?
[00:30:45.270] 你真的很喜欢打扮，对吧？
[00:30:46.570] It's just like I'm like, oh I need to stop by and grab something
[00:30:46.570] 就好像我会想，哦，我得顺路去买点东西。
[00:30:48.570] from this one store.
[00:30:48.570] 来自这家店。
[00:30:49.470] But every time I go I think about like, oh this used to be
[00:30:49.470] 但我每次去那里都会想，哦，这里以前是……
[00:30:52.570] such a place where I would wear like my nicest shit.
[00:30:52.570] 那样的地方，我会穿上我最体面的衣服。
[00:30:55.470] Dude.
[00:30:55.470] 老兄。
[00:30:55.970] Like come in like a dress and I'm like, oh my god, it's like
[00:30:55.970] 就像穿着裙子进来一样，我当时就想，我的天哪，这就像
[00:30:58.770] a huge deal that we're like wearing dresses.
[00:30:58.770] 这可是件大事，就像我们穿裙子一样。
[00:31:01.270] And we were like 15 year old.
[00:31:01.270] 我们当时大概15岁。
[00:31:03.470] Yeah.
[00:31:03.470] 是的。
[00:31:04.470] And I remember my friends got me a sash and it was like
[00:31:04.470] 我记得我的朋友们送了我一条绶带，感觉就像……
[00:31:06.970] sweet 16 or something like that.
[00:31:06.970] 甜蜜的16岁之类的。
[00:31:09.570] I also remember in high school, I think on average birthdays
[00:31:09.570] 我还记得高中时，我觉得平均而言，生日
[00:31:13.970] were a little more like, oh, let's just go out and get dinner.
[00:31:13.970] 更像是，哦，我们出去吃顿饭吧。
[00:31:17.170] Mmm true.
[00:31:17.170] 嗯，确实如此。
[00:31:18.370] Yeah.
[00:31:18.370] 是的。
[00:31:18.570] So I remember like sometimes would go to places like
[00:31:18.570] 所以我记得有时候会去一些地方，比如
[00:31:20.770] Cheesecake Factory and have dinner and then like walk around
[00:31:20.770] 去芝士蛋糕工厂吃晚餐，然后四处逛逛。
[00:31:24.570] or sometimes it would be like let's eat dinner and then go
[00:31:24.570] 或者有时候会说，我们先吃晚饭，然后就走。
[00:31:27.470] watch a movie after.
[00:31:27.470] 之后去看电影。
[00:31:29.270] Like I think birthday parties started to like tone down
[00:31:29.270] 我觉得生日派对的氛围开始变得低调起来了。
[00:31:32.470] a little more but but then like of course 16 was such a big
[00:31:32.470] 再多一点，但是，当然，16岁是一个很大的数字。
[00:31:35.570] deal.
[00:31:35.570] 交易。
[00:31:36.070] Right.
[00:31:36.070] 正确的。
[00:31:36.470] I remember for 16.
[00:31:36.470] 我记得16岁。
[00:31:38.370] I asked my parents.
[00:31:38.370] 我问了我的父母。
[00:31:39.270] I was like, oh my god, I want to have a 16th birthday party.
[00:31:39.270] 我当时想，天哪，我想办个16岁生日派对。
[00:31:42.170] It's like a thing here.
[00:31:42.170] 这就像这里特有的一件东西。
[00:31:43.770] Like for some reason 16 is a big age.
[00:31:43.770] 不知为何，16岁似乎是一个很大的年纪。
[00:31:46.970] Yeah, and my parents were like that's interesting.
[00:31:46.970] 是啊，我爸妈当时就觉得这很有意思。
[00:31:50.170] And then my dad was like I guess at 16 you can get married.
[00:31:50.170] 然后我爸爸说，我想16岁就可以结婚了。
[00:31:53.670] Whoa, because that's what it originally was right?
[00:31:53.670] 哇，因为它原本就是那样的，对吧？
[00:31:57.170] I had no I like I never made that connection.
[00:31:57.170] 我当时完全没有意识到，我从来没有把这两件事联系起来。
[00:32:00.770] And so I just invited a bunch of friends over to my place
[00:32:00.770] 于是我就邀请了一群朋友来我家。
[00:32:04.070] and then we like cooked dinner together and then we watched
[00:32:04.070] 然后我们一起做了晚饭，然后我们一起看电影。
[00:32:07.370] a movie.
[00:32:07.370] 一部电影。
[00:32:08.270] That's so cute.
[00:32:08.270] 太可爱了。
[00:32:08.970] Actually.
[00:32:08.970] 实际上。
[00:32:09.270] That's like kind of an adult thing to do to cook dinner
[00:32:09.270] 做饭这种事，感觉像是成年人该做的事。
[00:32:11.470] together.
[00:32:11.470] 一起。
[00:32:12.370] Yeah, we made pasta.
[00:32:12.370] 是的，我们做了意大利面。
[00:32:14.970] Wow.
[00:32:14.970] 哇。
[00:32:16.770] That's also funny too because I feel like when we were younger
[00:32:16.770] 这也很搞笑，因为我觉得当我们年轻的时候……
[00:32:20.270] the coolest stuff to do were things that made you feel like
[00:32:20.270] 最酷的事情就是那些让你感觉……的事情
[00:32:22.970] an adult.
[00:32:22.970] 成年人。
[00:32:23.870] I remember even when we went out for dinner or like when
[00:32:23.870] 我甚至记得我们出去吃饭或者类似的时候
[00:32:26.770] we had people over and had dinner together.
[00:32:26.770] 我们邀请了一些朋友来家里，一起吃了顿饭。
[00:32:29.470] We always needed to have cider because you know how the cider
[00:32:29.470] 我们总是需要苹果酒，因为你知道苹果酒有多棒。
[00:32:32.770] comes in like it almost looks like a wine or like champagne
[00:32:32.770] 端上来的时候看起来几乎像葡萄酒或香槟。
[00:32:35.770] bottle.
[00:32:35.770] 瓶子。
[00:32:36.570] Yeah, I remember that was a go-to thing like it always had
[00:32:36.570] 是的，我记得那一直是我们的首选方法。
[00:32:39.370] to be there.
[00:32:39.370] 到场。
[00:32:40.470] Definitely definitely and it always looks like champagne
[00:32:40.470] 绝对是，而且它看起来总是像香槟。
[00:32:44.370] too when you pour it out.
[00:32:44.370] 当你倒出来的时候也是一样。
[00:32:45.670] Yeah, I did feel like there was a shift though during this
[00:32:45.670] 是的，我确实感觉在此期间发生了一些变化。
[00:32:50.770] time like as I mentioned around high school.
[00:32:50.770] 就像我之前提到的高中时期那样。
[00:32:53.670] I started being more like cognizant of my parents birthdays.
[00:32:53.670] 我开始更加留意父母的生日。
[00:32:57.270] Mm-hmm.
[00:32:57.270] 嗯。
[00:32:57.870] So then around that time I started remembering like, oh my
[00:32:57.870] 所以大概就在那时，我开始回忆起，哦，我的
[00:33:02.070] God, like should we go get a cake?
[00:33:02.070] 天哪，我们是不是该去买个蛋糕？
[00:33:03.770] It's you know, almost dad's birthday or it's almost mom's
[00:33:03.770] 你知道，爸爸的生日快到了，或者妈妈的生日也快到了。
[00:33:06.070] birthday or should we go out to eat?
[00:33:06.070] 生日还是出去吃饭？
[00:33:08.670] Of course at the time it could only be suggestions as a poor
[00:33:08.670] 当然，当时这只能是一些建议，因为对方很穷。
[00:33:12.470] high school student and then in like college, I would always
[00:33:12.470] 高中时，然后到了大学，我总是
[00:33:18.170] make sure to like text to be like happy birthday.
[00:33:18.170] 请务必点赞，内容可以是“生日快乐”。
[00:33:20.370] Whoever my brother would immediately text me after be like,
[00:33:20.370] 我哥哥之后第一时间给我发短信的人会是这样的：
[00:33:23.570] oh, it's like mom's birthday today.
[00:33:23.570] 哦，今天好像是妈妈的生日。
[00:33:25.570] I'm like, yes, that's why I sent the text.
[00:33:25.570] 我当时就想，对，这就是我发短信的原因。
[00:33:27.570] He's like, okay.
[00:33:27.570] 他好像说，好吧。
[00:33:28.870] He sent the text after.
[00:33:28.870] 他之后发了这条短信。
[00:33:31.370] Now that like we're adults.
[00:33:31.370] 现在我们就像成年人一样。
[00:33:33.170] I feel like there's so much more power in our hands, I guess.
[00:33:33.170] 我觉得我们现在掌握了更多的权力。
[00:33:37.770] So like especially right now because I'm so close to my parents
[00:33:37.770] 尤其是现在，因为我和父母关系很亲密。
[00:33:41.270] like physically, so it's a lot easier for me to be like, oh,
[00:33:41.270] 比如在生理上，所以对我来说更容易做到，哦，
[00:33:44.670] hey, it's like dad's birthday today.
[00:33:44.670] 嘿，今天好像是爸爸的生日。
[00:33:46.770] Let's go out and eat a meal or like, you know, hey, it's mom's
[00:33:46.770] 咱们出去吃顿饭吧，或者，你知道，嘿，这是妈妈的……
[00:33:49.570] birthday.
[00:33:49.570] 生日。
[00:33:49.970] Let's go out and eat a meal.
[00:33:49.970] 我们出去吃饭吧。
[00:33:51.370] What do you want to eat?
[00:33:51.370] 你想吃什么？
[00:33:52.270] I'll like take us all out or whatever.
[00:33:52.270] 我想带我们出去玩什么的。
[00:33:54.070] So I feel like there's slowly been a shift from like not even
[00:33:54.070] 所以我觉得，这种转变已经慢慢发生了，从以前那种甚至都不……
[00:33:59.170] registering that my parents had birthdays to like now kind of
[00:33:59.170] 记录我父母的生日，就像现在这样
[00:34:03.170] taking control of well not taking control of the day but like
[00:34:03.170] 掌控，嗯，不是掌控一天，而是像
[00:34:07.170] stepping up to offer plans and suggestions.
[00:34:07.170] 主动提出方案和建议。
[00:34:10.570] Dude, I actually totally agree with that because it's like now
[00:34:10.570] 老兄，我完全同意，因为现在的情况就是这样。
[00:34:14.870] that we're autonomous adults, I guess and I think especially
[00:34:14.870] 我想，我们都是自主的成年人，而且我认为尤其如此。
[00:34:18.370] the pivotal moment for me was when I got my license and got
[00:34:18.370] 对我来说，关键时刻是我拿到驾照的那一刻。
[00:34:22.570] a car.
[00:34:22.570] 一辆车。
[00:34:23.370] So it's like if I do want to get a present, I no longer have
[00:34:23.370] 所以，就好像如果我想要一份礼物，我就没有机会了。
[00:34:25.770] to be like, oh mom, should we go to Mervin's and get dad?
[00:34:25.770] 就像这样，哦，妈妈，我们是不是该去默文家接爸爸？
[00:34:30.470] It's like, okay, I can drive to Valleyfair and like get something
[00:34:30.470] 就好像，好吧，我可以开车去Valleyfair买点东西。
[00:34:33.170] for my dad.
[00:34:33.170] 献给我爸爸。
[00:34:33.770] True.
[00:34:33.770] 真的。
[00:34:34.570] But I think the other weird thing for me too is I guess age
[00:34:34.570] 但我觉得对我来说，另一件奇怪的事大概就是年龄吧。
[00:34:39.170] registers a little bit more for me now in terms of how I see
[00:34:39.170] 现在，就我的看法而言，这件事对我来说有了更深的体会。
[00:34:42.370] birthdays for my parents.
[00:34:42.370] 祝我父母生日快乐。
[00:34:44.170] And what I mean by that is like when I was young is like, oh
[00:34:44.170] 我的意思是，就像我小时候那样，哦
[00:34:47.370] it's mom's 42nd birthday or like it's dad's 45th or whatever
[00:34:47.370] 今天是妈妈的42岁生日，或者爸爸的45岁生日，或者其他什么日子。
[00:34:51.170] whatever and it was just kind of like a number but I think
[00:34:51.170] 随便吧，它就像个数字一样，但我认为
[00:34:55.270] now my dad hit 60 for his birthday last year and I felt so
[00:34:55.270] 去年我爸爸60岁生日的时候，我感觉……
[00:35:01.970] many emotions about it.
[00:35:01.970] 对此我百感交集。
[00:35:03.770] And I think my dad did too because it's a big deal when the
[00:35:03.770] 我觉得我爸爸也这么认为，因为这是一件大事。
[00:35:07.470] like first digit of your age changes and it was kind of like
[00:35:07.470] 就像你年龄的第一位数字变了一样，感觉有点像……
[00:35:11.870] a thing where we lightly talked about it like, oh haha, it's
[00:35:11.870] 我们当时只是轻松地谈论这件事，就像，哦，哈哈，这……
[00:35:15.370] a big deal back in Korea in the old days like 60 was a thing
[00:35:15.370] 在过去的韩国，60岁可是件大事，那时候60岁可是件大事。
[00:35:20.170] where you threw like a huge party because it's like, oh you
[00:35:20.170] 你办了个盛大的派对，因为，哦，你
[00:35:22.470] hit 60 congratulations.
[00:35:22.470] 恭喜你达到60岁！
[00:35:23.870] That's rare now.
[00:35:23.870] 现在这种情况很少见了。
[00:35:25.170] It's obviously not as crazy of a milestone to reach 60, but
[00:35:25.170] 显然，60岁并不是一个多么了不起的里程碑，但是……
[00:35:29.570] it's just I think about it a little more like it's a little
[00:35:29.570] 我只是觉得，这有点像……
[00:35:32.970] bit morbid in a sense and a little bit sentimental, but I
[00:35:32.970] 有点病态，也有点伤感，但我
[00:35:37.170] feel like age is like a big deal now.
[00:35:37.170] 感觉年龄现在成了个大问题。
[00:35:40.570] Dude.
[00:35:40.570] 老兄。
[00:35:41.370] Yeah.
[00:35:41.370] 是的。
[00:35:41.770] Oh my God speaking of my dad also turned 60 this past year,
[00:35:41.770] 我的天哪，说到这个，我爸爸去年也60岁了。
[00:35:46.670] but the okay the bad thing was my mom was out of town for
[00:35:46.670] 但糟糕的是，我妈妈出差了。
[00:35:50.570] that period of time.
[00:35:50.570] 那段时间。
[00:35:52.170] So like the house wasn't complete.
[00:35:52.170] 感觉房子还没完工。
[00:35:54.670] I think I had like plans or something.
[00:35:54.670] 我想我当时好像有一些计划之类的。
[00:35:57.770] And so we kind of like just like missed it in terms of like,
[00:35:57.770] 所以，我们好像就错过了什么，比如说，
[00:36:01.870] you know getting everyone together to like eat food and like
[00:36:01.870] 你知道，就是把大家聚在一起吃饭什么的。
[00:36:04.870] have a cake and then when my mom came back she was like, oh
[00:36:04.870] 我吃了一块蛋糕，然后我妈妈回来后就说，哦
[00:36:08.170] dad turned 60.
[00:36:08.170] 爸爸60岁了。
[00:36:09.370] Did you guys celebrate?
[00:36:09.370] 你们庆祝了吗？
[00:36:10.370] And I was like, oh and I was like, well, you know, it's your
[00:36:10.370] 我当时就想，哦，然后我就想，你知道，这是你的
[00:36:14.570] birthday soon too and you both turned 60.
[00:36:14.570] 你们俩的生日也快到了，而且你们都60岁了。
[00:36:17.570] So we'll celebrate for your birthday.
[00:36:17.570] 所以我们会为你庆祝生日。
[00:36:20.770] I was like, but I did give dad like a mooncake.
[00:36:20.770] 我当时想，但我确实给了爸爸一块月饼。
[00:36:25.270] My mom was like what the fuck?
[00:36:25.270] 我妈当时就懵了，心想：这他妈什么鬼？
[00:36:27.570] Wait, I feel like I had such a like the almost the exact opposite
[00:36:27.570] 等等，我感觉我好像有过一种几乎完全相反的感觉
[00:36:31.270] experience with you.
[00:36:31.270] 和你相处的经历。
[00:36:32.770] So when my dad turned 60, I was like, oh, it's like a huge deal
[00:36:32.770] 所以当我爸爸60岁生日的时候，我就觉得，哦，这可是件大事啊。
[00:36:36.070] and it was kind of like in the throes of wedding planning.
[00:36:36.070] 当时的感觉就像正忙于筹备婚礼一样。
[00:36:38.770] It was like two or three months before the wedding.
[00:36:38.770] 当时距离婚礼还有两三个月。
[00:36:42.370] So we were super busy, but I was still like, okay, this is
[00:36:42.370] 所以当时我们超级忙，但我还是想，好吧，这就是
[00:36:44.670] a big birthday.
[00:36:44.670] 一个盛大的生日。
[00:36:45.270] Like we need to fly to Texas.
[00:36:45.270] 好像我们需要飞去德克萨斯州似的。
[00:36:46.970] So James and I took we didn't take the week off, but I had
[00:36:46.970] 所以我和詹姆斯没有休假，但我有
[00:36:50.070] made sure like my weekends in Dallas were like completely
[00:36:50.070] 我确保我在达拉斯的周末过得完全
[00:36:53.370] free so that we can celebrate my dad's birthday.
[00:36:53.370] 免费的，这样我们就可以庆祝我爸爸的生日了。
[00:36:55.870] Right and we were there for like a week or 10 days or something,
[00:36:55.870] 对，我们在那里待了大概一个星期或者十天左右。
[00:36:58.970] but for some reason my dad is busier than me and James are
[00:36:58.970] 但不知为何，我爸爸比我和詹姆斯都忙。
[00:37:03.370] so of those 10 days.
[00:37:03.370] 所以，这十天里。
[00:37:05.970] He was like out of town for like four days and then like three
[00:37:05.970] 他好像出差了四天，然后又过了三天。
[00:37:09.170] of those nights.
[00:37:09.170] 那些夜晚。
[00:37:09.870] He had like social obligations with other people and his
[00:37:09.870] 他和其他人和他一样，都有社交义务。
[00:37:12.870] friends and then like one of those days he was working and
[00:37:12.870] 朋友们，然后就像往常一样，有一天他在工作，
[00:37:16.370] like busy with meetings all night.
[00:37:16.370] 比如整晚都在忙着开会。
[00:37:18.470] So we really had like maybe like a day and a half to celebrate.
[00:37:18.470] 所以，我们实际上只有大概一天半的时间来庆祝。
[00:37:22.570] So I was like, why are we here for 10 days when you can only
[00:37:22.570] 所以我就想，既然只能待十天，为什么我们还要在这里待十天呢？
[00:37:24.970] hang out with me to grab like dinner ones and then we played
[00:37:24.970] 跟我一起出去玩，吃个饭什么的，然后我们就玩了。
[00:37:27.370] like golf another day or something.
[00:37:27.370] 比如改天打高尔夫什么的。
[00:37:29.670] You're like, wait a second.
[00:37:29.670] 你会想，等等。
[00:37:31.070] Yeah.
[00:37:31.070] 是的。
[00:37:31.370] I was like dad is too busy and popular for me.
[00:37:31.370] 我当时就想，爸爸太忙太受欢迎了，没空理我。
[00:37:33.770] Yeah.
[00:37:33.770] 是的。
[00:37:34.370] Wait.
[00:37:34.370] 等待。
[00:37:34.570] Oh my God.
[00:37:34.570] 我的天啊。
[00:37:35.070] I'm remembering now what the plans were for my dad's birthday.
[00:37:35.070] 我现在想起来我爸爸生日的计划了。
[00:37:38.870] He actually had plans to go camping with some of his friends
[00:37:38.870] 他原本计划和几个朋友一起去露营。
[00:37:42.170] because I think it was like a full moon day of that month,
[00:37:42.170] 因为我觉得那天应该是当月的满月日。
[00:37:46.270] you know, they went up to a camp spot and all excited and
[00:37:46.270] 你知道，他们兴高采烈地来到一个露营地，
[00:37:51.470] then it like poured.
[00:37:51.470] 然后就像倾泻而下一样。
[00:37:53.370] Oh my God.
[00:37:53.370] 我的天啊。
[00:37:54.670] My dad was like dude, like we didn't even see the moon.
[00:37:54.670] 我爸当时就说，老兄，好像我们连月亮都没看到似的。
[00:37:57.170] It was just like cloudy and cold and rainy and then he like
[00:37:57.170] 当时天气阴沉，又冷又下雨，然后他就……
[00:38:01.170] came back and I was like, oh happy birthday and I gave him
[00:38:01.170] 他回来后，我就说，哦，生日快乐，然后我给了他
[00:38:05.470] a mooncake.
[00:38:05.470] 月饼。
[00:38:06.870] So we had the same experience where our dads were like, I
[00:38:06.870] 所以我们的经历很相似，我们的爸爸都说，我
[00:38:10.170] don't want to spend my birthday with you.
[00:38:10.170] 我不想和你一起过生日。
[00:38:13.370] It slipped my mind for a day.
[00:38:13.370] 我有一天把这件事给忘了。
[00:38:15.470] So I was like, oh shoot.
[00:38:15.470] 我当时就想，糟了。
[00:38:16.470] I felt bad and I was like, okay, we'll have to celebrate when
[00:38:16.470] 我感到很内疚，心想，好吧，我们得找个时间庆祝一下。
[00:38:19.170] mom's back.
[00:38:19.170] 妈妈回来了。
[00:38:20.370] I think also it felt kind of wrong to be like just me and
[00:38:20.370] 我觉得只有我一个人感觉有点不对劲。
[00:38:23.370] my dad like we're missing our third person.
[00:38:23.370] 我爸觉得我们家好像少了第三个人。
[00:38:26.470] So I was like, oh my God, why are you out of town mom?
[00:38:26.470] 所以我就问，我的天哪，妈妈，你怎么不在城里？
[00:38:30.570] Actually, it's your fault.
[00:38:30.570] 其实，这都是你的错。
[00:38:33.470] Yeah, it's like interesting to me too the way you kind of
[00:38:33.470] 是啊，你这种做法也让我觉得很有意思。
[00:38:36.570] said now it's more of our role to take charge or like we
[00:38:36.570] 现在我们说，承担责任或者像我们一样，更多的是我们的角色。
[00:38:40.670] at least have the opportunity to like step up to sort of
[00:38:40.670] 至少有机会向上发展，比如……
[00:38:44.070] lead the whole birthday shenanigans and yeah, I feel like
[00:38:44.070] 主导整个生日庆祝活动，是的，我觉得
[00:38:47.270] that's very true.
[00:38:47.270] 确实如此。
[00:38:48.570] One of the things that I remember my parents always saying
[00:38:48.570] 我记得父母常说的一句话是……
[00:38:50.570] when I was younger kind of going back to like the oh don't
[00:38:50.570] 我年轻的时候有点像回到了那种“哦，不要”的状态
[00:38:53.170] spend your hard-earned money on a gift for me thing is like
[00:38:53.170] 用你辛苦挣来的钱给我买礼物，这感觉就像……
[00:38:56.470] my parents would always be like, oh, it's not that big of
[00:38:56.470] 我父母总是会说，哦，这没那么大。
[00:38:58.270] a deal.
[00:38:58.270] 达成协议。
[00:38:58.770] Like we'll celebrate it but let's keep it low-key.
[00:38:58.770] 我们会庆祝一下，但要低调一些。
[00:39:01.270] But now I'm like why?
[00:39:01.270] 但现在我却在想，为什么？
[00:39:03.570] You know, we can do the whole thing do the party hats and
[00:39:03.570] 你知道，我们可以把所有事情都做一遍，包括戴派对帽等等。
[00:39:07.370] do the you know balloons and I remember once I did bring
[00:39:07.370] 你知道，就是那种气球，我记得有一次我确实带过。
[00:39:11.470] the party hats and I made all of us like wear it and as
[00:39:11.470] 我让大家都戴上派对帽，就像……
[00:39:14.570] like silly as it is.
[00:39:14.570] 虽然这很荒谬。
[00:39:16.570] I feel like these things kind of matter and they do sort
[00:39:16.570] 我觉得这些事挺重要的，而且它们确实很重要。
[00:39:19.370] of make an impact and you can always at least have like
[00:39:19.370] 产生影响，而且你至少可以拥有这样的感受。
[00:39:21.970] funny photos to like back on.
[00:39:21.970] 有趣的图片，值得点赞。
[00:39:24.270] Now, I feel like especially after the whole like, oh we
[00:39:24.270] 现在，我觉得尤其是在经历了这一切之后，就像，哦，我们
[00:39:26.770] did our wedding.
[00:39:26.770] 为我们主持了婚礼。
[00:39:27.270] So let's just fucking celebrate everything we can kind of
[00:39:27.270] 所以，让我们尽情庆祝我们能庆祝的一切吧。
[00:39:30.470] mentality.
[00:39:30.470] 心理。
[00:39:31.670] I'm like, maybe I'll get the huge, you know, like the sorority
[00:39:31.670] 我当时想，也许我会加入那种大型的，你知道的，像姐妹会那样的组织。
[00:39:34.270] girl balloons with like the age on it.
[00:39:34.270] 女孩气球，上面写着她的年龄。
[00:39:38.170] Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:38.170] 对，没错。
[00:39:39.470] Six one, my sweet sixty one.
[00:39:39.470] 六十一，我亲爱的六十一岁。
[00:39:43.870] But it's like let's just go all out and not, you know, not
[00:39:43.870] 但感觉就像我们要全力以赴，而不是，你知道，不是
[00:39:47.970] listen to them when they're like, oh, let's keep it low-key
[00:39:47.970] 听他们的，当他们说“哦，咱们低调点儿吧”的时候。
[00:39:50.170] this year, right?
[00:39:50.170] 今年吧？
[00:39:51.470] Yeah.
[00:39:51.470] 是的。
[00:39:52.270] Also a reason why this topic is so top of mind is because
[00:39:52.270] 这个话题之所以如此受关注，另一个原因是：
[00:39:56.070] today is my mom's birthday.
[00:39:56.070] 今天是妈妈的生日。
[00:39:59.370] So I was like thinking back on how I was like, yeah, we'll
[00:39:59.370] 所以我就回想了一下，当时我就想，是啊，我们会
[00:40:03.470] celebrate for sure when you're back and then you're both
[00:40:03.470] 回来后一定要好好庆祝一下，然后你们俩就都……
[00:40:06.470] 60 and we'll make sure to get a cake and everything.
[00:40:06.470] 60，我们一定准备蛋糕和其他东西。
[00:40:10.070] Okay.
[00:40:10.070] 好的。
[00:40:10.270] Also, what's funny is that no one in our family really likes
[00:40:10.270] 还有，有趣的是，我们家没人真正喜欢……
[00:40:14.370] cake except for my mom.
[00:40:14.370] 除了我妈妈以外，没人吃蛋糕。
[00:40:16.470] So she's like goddamn like every time we get a cake is just
[00:40:16.470] 所以她就说，天哪，每次我们收到蛋糕的时候，她都……
[00:40:20.070] me left eating it.
[00:40:20.070] 我吃着它离开了。
[00:40:22.970] Damn, maybe I should do like slices.
[00:40:22.970] 哎，或许我应该做成切片。
[00:40:24.870] Although I guess it's not doesn't look visually as nice.
[00:40:24.870] 虽然我觉得它在视觉上看起来没那么好看。
[00:40:27.970] We always make the birthday person blow out their candles.
[00:40:27.970] 我们总是让过生日的人吹灭蜡烛。
[00:40:31.670] Yeah, but yeah, I think what I started doing is after I
[00:40:31.670] 是的，不过，我觉得我开始做的事情是在我……之后
[00:40:35.770] discovered thanks to you actually that like Paris Baguette
[00:40:35.770] 多亏了你，我才发现原来巴黎贝甜也这么棒！
[00:40:39.070] does the smaller cakes.
[00:40:39.070] 做小蛋糕。
[00:40:41.470] I was like, oh we should just get like not big cakes then.
[00:40:41.470] 我当时就想，哦，那我们应该买小一点的蛋糕。
[00:40:45.670] Dude, it's the best because sometimes it's like a fucking
[00:40:45.670] 老兄，这简直太棒了，因为有时候它就像……
[00:40:48.470] chore.
[00:40:48.470] 家务。
[00:40:49.370] Oh my God birthday cake for breakfast for the next week.
[00:40:49.370] 我的天哪，接下来一周早餐都要吃生日蛋糕了。
[00:40:52.970] Wait, actually that's legitimately what my mom does and
[00:40:52.970] 等等，其实我妈就是这么做的。
[00:40:55.870] she's like you guys aren't going to help and we're like, oh,
[00:40:55.870] 她好像在说你们不会帮忙的，我们则说，哦，
[00:40:58.870] you know, I don't really eat cake but sometimes my dad helps.
[00:40:58.870] 你知道，我其实不怎么吃蛋糕，但我爸爸有时候会帮我吃。
[00:41:04.070] I know I think it truly becomes like a mission.
[00:41:04.070] 我知道，我觉得这真的就像一项使命。
[00:41:06.270] It's like oh don't eat too much for dinner because remember
[00:41:06.270] 就像是，哦，晚饭别吃太多，因为要记住
[00:41:08.170] we have cake in the fridge.
[00:41:08.170] 冰箱里有蛋糕。
[00:41:10.770] Well, a very happy happy birthday to your mom.
[00:41:10.770] 祝你妈妈生日快乐！
[00:41:13.670] Hopefully you guys can have a nice celebration with your
[00:41:13.670] 希望你们能和你们一起度过一个愉快的庆祝活动
[00:41:16.570] family.
[00:41:16.570] 家庭。
[00:41:17.470] The cake thing is funny too because now that I'm like long
[00:41:17.470] 蛋糕那件事也挺搞笑的，因为我现在感觉自己像个长个子了。
[00:41:20.370] distance family ship with my parents if I'm not able to celebrate
[00:41:20.370] 如果我不能和父母庆祝，我会和他们保持距离，一起庆祝。
[00:41:24.570] their birthdays in person, I'll like door dash them cake and
[00:41:24.570] 我会亲自去给他们过生日，我会用 DoorDash 送蛋糕给他们。
[00:41:28.070] especially since they moved around a little bit.
[00:41:28.070] 尤其是因为他们稍微搬动了一下。
[00:41:30.170] I feel like I'm always trying to find like the best bakery
[00:41:30.170] 我感觉自己一直在努力寻找最好的面包店
[00:41:32.470] near them, but it's like I can really only go off of like
[00:41:32.470] 虽然离他们很近，但我感觉我只能根据……来判断。
[00:41:35.270] Yelp reviews or some shit.
[00:41:35.270] Yelp评论之类的东西。
[00:41:37.070] So I'm always like how's this bakery?
[00:41:37.070] 所以我总是会问：这家面包店怎么样？
[00:41:38.870] Like should I go to this other bakery next time?
[00:41:38.870] 我下次应该去另一家面包店吗？
[00:41:40.970] Yeah, that's nice.
[00:41:40.970] 是啊，那挺好的。
[00:41:42.470] And I feel like a lot of the time it's just like the acknowledgement
[00:41:42.470] 我觉得很多时候这只是一种认可。
[00:41:46.370] and like knowing that we're also thinking of our parents that
[00:41:46.370] 而且知道我们也在想着我们的父母，这种感觉真好。
[00:41:50.870] like makes them happy, hopefully.
[00:41:50.870] 希望这样能让他们开心。
[00:41:54.070] So, you know, even if it's a low-key event at least we are
[00:41:54.070] 所以，你知道，即使只是个低调的活动，至少我们也是
[00:41:59.170] participating in it and remembering it like this special day
[00:41:59.170] 参与其中，并将这一天铭记于心，就像记住这个特殊的日子一样。
[00:42:02.970] unless my parents are like, please stop.
[00:42:02.970] 除非我父母说：“求求你们别再说了。”
[00:42:05.270] I think I will continue to try and celebrate in whatever way
[00:42:05.270] 我想我还会继续尝试以各种方式庆祝。
[00:42:11.070] with my parents.
[00:42:11.070] 和我的父母一起。
[00:42:12.170] Yeah, I love that.
[00:42:12.170] 是的，我喜欢这个。
[00:42:13.470] I think same for me as well.
[00:42:13.470] 我也这么觉得。
[00:42:15.070] I'll always try to make it a little bit special for them.
[00:42:15.070] 我会尽力让他们觉得这有点特别。
[00:42:18.570] Even if the mission of figuring out what they truly want for their
[00:42:18.570] 即使他们的任务是弄清楚他们真正想要的是什么
[00:42:21.570] birthday is like the hardest ever.
[00:42:21.570] 生日简直是最难熬的一天。
[00:42:23.870] Oh my god, dude.
[00:42:23.870] 我的天哪，老兄。
[00:42:25.170] Maybe it's actually a blessing that my parents are awkward about
[00:42:25.170] 也许我父母在这方面的笨拙反而是件好事。
[00:42:28.270] gifts because then they never ask for gifts.
[00:42:28.270] 因为这样他们就不会主动索要礼物了。
[00:42:31.370] So I'm like, okay, then I'll just like pay for dinner today or
[00:42:31.370] 所以我就想，好吧，那我今天就付晚餐钱吧。
[00:42:34.870] like, you know, I'll make sure to go get the cake today and
[00:42:34.870] 你知道，我今天一定会去买蛋糕的。
[00:42:37.270] then I'm like nice.
[00:42:37.270] 然后我就觉得挺好的。
[00:42:38.070] I don't have to think about gift giving for them.
[00:42:38.070] 我不用费心考虑送他们什么礼物。
[00:42:41.170] Dude, my parents literally just gave up for their gifts to me.
[00:42:41.170] 老兄，我爸妈简直放弃了给我买的礼物。
[00:42:44.170] Like I feel like I still try to get them something like a product
[00:42:44.170] 感觉我仍然想给他们买些东西，比如产品。
[00:42:47.870] but my mom is like, I'm just gonna Zelle you like couple hundred
[00:42:47.870] 但我妈说，我直接给你转几百块钱吧。
[00:42:51.670] dollars.
[00:42:51.670] 美元。
[00:42:52.270] Like is that cool?
[00:42:52.270] 这很酷吗？
[00:42:53.170] I'm like, okay.
[00:42:53.170] 我当时就想，好吧。
[00:42:54.470] Like damn.
[00:42:54.470] 真是糟透了。
[00:42:56.370] I'm like, can I at least get like a card or some shit?
[00:42:56.370] 我心想，至少给我张卡片什么的吧？
[00:43:00.570] She's like no, just the bank receipt.
[00:43:00.570] 她回答说：不，只要银行收据就行。
[00:43:02.870] But yeah, they're so like chill about it.
[00:43:02.870] 不过，他们对此真的非常淡定。
[00:43:04.470] I'm like, oh my god, I need to get something special.
[00:43:04.470] 我当时就想，我的天哪，我得买点特别的东西。
[00:43:06.270] My mom is like, yeah, you're getting cash.
[00:43:06.270] 我妈说，是啊，你会拿到现金的。
[00:43:09.870] Not even a birthday message on the Zelle payment by the way.
[00:43:09.870] 顺便一提，Zelle付款上甚至连生日祝福都没有。
[00:43:14.170] Oh my god, that's so funny.
[00:43:14.170] 我的天哪，这太搞笑了。
[00:43:17.070] Ultimately, I think it's really nice to just celebrate with
[00:43:17.070] 最终，我觉得和大家一起庆祝真的很好。
[00:43:19.770] your parents and I think it's also a good reminder that like,
[00:43:19.770] 你的父母，我觉得这也是一个很好的提醒，比如，
[00:43:23.570] you know, our parents are getting older.
[00:43:23.570] 你知道，我们的父母年纪都大了。
[00:43:25.770] So cherish the time that we have with them.
