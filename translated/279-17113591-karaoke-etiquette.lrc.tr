[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Jessica. So you probably recognize a familiar voice today joining us on the pod. Jessica has been a
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Jessica。今天加入我们播客的是一位熟悉的声音。Jessica一直以来都是……
[00:00:24.290] multi-time guest on our podcast. Also, fun fact for anyone who doesn't know already, Jessica, Crystal, and I lived together for multiple years in college. Our trio is kind of reuniting today. Okay. Jessica is actually, I think, the perfect guest that we thought of for this episode topic because she is an avid fan of what we're going to dive into. And this is karaoke and the world of
[00:00:24.290] 她曾多次做客我们的播客节目。另外，还有一个趣闻，可能有些人还不知道，杰西卡、克里斯托和我大学时一起住了好几年。今天我们三个算是重聚了。好了。杰西卡其实是我们这期节目主题的最佳嘉宾人选，因为她是我们即将深入探讨的内容的忠实粉丝。而这期节目的主题就是卡拉OK和……
[00:00:49.250] etiquette that comes with karaoke. So let's kick this off by discussing how often do you karaoke? I mean, it comes in waves, but probably every other month, sometimes more frequently, sometimes maybe like every two months. But I feel like I go at least once a quarter. Actually, that sounds really little. Yeah, I swear I'd probably go more. But I feel like in general,
[00:00:49.250] 卡拉OK礼仪。那么，我们先来聊聊你多久去一次卡拉OK吧？我的意思是，去的频率时高时低，大概每两个月去一次，有时候更频繁，有时候可能每两个月去一次。但我感觉我至少每季度去一次。其实，这听起来真的很少。是啊，我发誓我可能还会去更多次。但我觉得总的来说，
[00:01:15.510] it's just always something that is an option, especially at the end of the night or like converting some kind of dinner into eventually going karaoke. I feel like when I do go, it might be like back to back weekends or something. So in general, I feel like I do go quite a bit. I don't actually know how often the average person goes. So I'm assuming I go a lot. How about you, Crystal? Dude, I don't know.
[00:01:15.510] 这始终是一个可行的选择，尤其是在晚上结束的时候，或者像把晚餐变成卡拉OK聚会之类的。我觉得我去的时候，可能连续两个周末都去。所以总的来说，我觉得我去的次数还挺多的。我其实不知道一般人多久去一次，所以我估计我去得挺频繁的。你呢，Crystal？老兄，我也不知道。
[00:01:39.230] I think it's similar to what Jessica said. Sometimes it comes in waves. So there's sometimes a dry spell or sometimes you're karaokeing like every week. But I think it also depends where you are. I live in the suburbs right now. So I feel like karaoke is a little less common because there's a whole like, you know, you got to drive to the place and you have to like gather the troops and everyone has to converge.
[00:01:39.230] 我觉得跟杰西卡说的差不多。有时候会像潮水一样起起伏伏。所以有时候会有一段时间没唱卡拉OK，有时候又会像每周都唱一样。但我觉得这也跟你住的地方有关。我现在住在郊区。所以我觉得卡拉OK在这里不太常见，因为你知道，你得开车去唱卡拉OK的地方，还得召集大家，大家得聚在一起。
[00:02:05.130] But I think living in a city area or a more dense area usually results in higher possibility of karaokeing or in a college town. I feel like we karaoke it a lot in college. But lately, I think not super often. Yeah, probably like once a quarter. But I feel like Jessica, you're probably more than once a quarter. Yeah, I was gonna say earlier when Jessica was talking about Oh, maybe
[00:02:05.130] 但我认为住在城市地区或人口更密集的地区，或者大学城，通常更容易唱卡拉OK。我觉得我们在大学里经常唱卡拉OK。但最近，我觉得没那么频繁了。嗯，大概一个季度一次吧。但我觉得杰西卡，你可能不止一个季度一次。对，我之前正想说，杰西卡说“哦，也许”的时候，我就要这么说了。
[00:02:33.130] once every other month. I'm like, she definitely goes like monthly at the very least. Well, I guess I should also talk about how often I go because it's not like I go infrequently. I think I probably actually go every other month on average, maybe six to eight times a year. But I think like you guys both said, it does come in waves. There's times where I'll go and then I'll be like, damn, I didn't get to sing any of these other songs. And then it'll make me want to go again in like two
[00:02:33.130] 大概两个月一次。我就想，她肯定至少每月都去一次。嗯，我想我也应该说说我去的频率，因为我去的次数并不少。我觉得我平均大概是两个月去一次，一年大概六到八次。但我觉得就像你们俩说的，去的次数确实是起起伏伏的。有时候我去了，然后就会想，哎呀，我还没唱完其他的歌呢。然后我又会很想过个二三月再去一次。
[00:03:00.310] weeks or something. Or sometimes it's like, Oh, the karaoke machine at this one place didn't have it, we should go to this other place. So there's always like a reason to go when you've just been true. And I do feel like there's been a game changer lately, because you have a karaoke machine at your place now. I do. It's not like a really sophisticated, you know, like those really intense ones that are like a podium. It's just like a speaker. And then we like hook it up to YouTube.
[00:03:00.310] 几个星期什么的。或者有时候会想，哦，这家店的卡拉OK机没有歌，我们应该去另一家。所以，只要你真心想去，总会有理由去。而且我觉得最近情况发生了很大的变化，因为现在家里也有卡拉OK机了。我家就有。它不是那种很高级的，你知道，像那种带讲台的。它就是一个音箱。然后我们把它连上YouTube。
[00:03:27.370] And I feel like that does already a really good job. So sometimes when we all hang out, the night turns into karaoke. True. It is portable. So I'm able to like bring it around to other people's places if it's not at our house. Oh, I didn't know it was portable. Yeah, that's cool. I don't remember. Does it come with a mic and everything? It comes with one mic. And then we bought an extra mic. So now we have two. That is a pretty good machine to have. I feel like if I ever bought a
[00:03:27.370] 我觉得它已经很好用了。所以有时候我们聚在一起，晚上就变成了卡拉OK。没错。它是便携式的。所以如果不在我们家，我可以把它带到别人家去。哦，我不知道它是便携式的。是啊，真棒。我不记得了。它自带麦克风之类的配件吗？它自带一个麦克风。然后我们又买了一个。所以现在我们有两个。这真是一台很棒的机器。我觉得如果我以后再买一台
[00:03:54.390] house like you, that would be one of the top five things that I would buy. You're like couchless, like fridgeless, like a coffee table and the karaoke machine. Dude, I think about that a lot too. I'm like, wow, if I buy a home, one of the rooms has to be like the karaoke room. True. Movie and karaoke room. Yeah. How would your karaoke room look though? I feel like even with
[00:03:54.390] 如果像你这样的房子，那卡拉OK机绝对是我最想买的五样东西之一。你家好像连沙发都没有，冰箱也没有，就差个咖啡桌和卡拉OK机了。哥们儿，我也经常想这个。我就想，哇，如果我买房，一定要有一个房间像卡拉OK房一样。没错。电影和卡拉OK房。是啊。不过你的卡拉OK房会是什么样子呢？我觉得即使……
[00:04:22.970] different karaoke places, they always have a different setup. So would yours have a little stage or would it just be like a big couch? I think a disco bowl is necessary. Oh, I do feel like the mood lighting makes a big difference. Yeah, definitely sets the tone. And I think I'd definitely put probably couches just so that everyone can like lounge and have a good time.
[00:04:22.970] 不同的卡拉OK场所布置都不一样。所以你的卡拉OK会有个小舞台吗？还是就放个大沙发？我觉得迪斯科碗是必须的。哦，我觉得氛围灯光真的很重要。没错，绝对能营造气氛。而且我肯定会放沙发，这样大家都能放松地享受美好时光。
[00:04:45.150] Stages like kind of pressure. Yeah, I agree. Actually, I had a big not necessarily epiphany. I feel like I knew this subconsciously before, but I consciously recognize it. After the karaoke that I went to this last Saturday, I feel like the size of the room has to be proportionate to the number of people you
[00:04:45.150] 舞台表演确实会带来一些压力。是的，我同意。实际上，我突然有了个很大的顿悟，虽然不能说是顿悟。我觉得我之前潜意识里就明白这一点，但现在我意识到了。上周六我去唱卡拉OK之后，我觉得房间的大小必须和人数成比例。
[00:05:08.930] have going. So what happened on Saturday and what's happened to me in the past before was that sometimes they'll give you a room that's too big compared to the number of people that you have. And I do feel like there can be too many people at karaoke. So maybe it's just that like the big rooms are not it period and you just need like a smaller, more controlled group. I feel like on Saturday, what happened was we had a fair amount of people going. So we had reserved and booked a bigger room,
[00:05:08.930] 确实如此。周六发生的事，以及我以前也遇到过的情况，就是有时候他们会给你安排一个比实际人数大得多的包厢。我觉得卡拉OK人太多确实不太合适。所以也许大包厢根本就不合适，你需要的是一个人数较少、更容易控制的团体。我觉得周六那天，我们去的人还不少，所以我们预订了一个比较大的包厢。
[00:05:38.770] but then a bunch of people bailed sadly for, you know, whatever reasons. I feel like half of them were hungover from Friday night. But anyway, so we ended up with a lesser amount of people, but a really big room. At the beginning, I feel like it's a little hard to navigate that. I guess it also depends on the group of people, like if they already know each other or not, basically. But I feel like two thirds of the way in, everybody's kind of in a corner. And so you just
[00:05:38.770] 但后来很多人因为各种原因遗憾地退出了。我觉得他们中有一半人周五晚上宿醉未醒。总之，最后人数少了，但房间却很大。一开始，我觉得有点难组织。我想这也取决于这群人，比如他们是否彼此认识之类的。但我觉得到了三分之二的时候，大家都挤在一个角落里。所以你就会……
[00:06:08.350] kind of dominate one corner and it makes the room feel smaller, which is good. But I do feel like if the room is too big, it'll kind of disperse the energy and make it not as fun, basically. Dude, you're so right. I think another aspect to like having too many people, which you kind of mentioned, is that it gets really hectic. Because Jisoo and I actually recently went to one of our
[00:06:08.350] 占据房间一角会让房间显得小一些，这样挺好。但我觉得如果房间太大，能量就会分散，气氛也会变得没那么好玩。哥们，你说得太对了。我觉得人太多还有一点，就像你刚才提到的，就是会很吵闹。因为我和Jisoo最近就去了我们其中一个聚会。
[00:06:35.830] friends' birthday parties. And it was really fun, but it was a lot of people in one really big karaoke room. And so like song queue requests kept getting accidentally canceled or skipped. But it was like one person really wanted to sing a song or something. And you had to like fight for the little pad or whatever to input your songs. And you're like, oh, shoot, mine got canceled. Let me go like put it back in. There's just like more chaos. Yeah, I feel like there's definitely a sweet spot to
[00:06:35.830] 朋友们的生日派对。真的很好玩，但是人太多了，挤在一个很大的卡拉OK包厢里。所以点歌单经常被误取消或者跳过。但有时候，比如有人特别想唱某首歌，你就得抢着用那个小键盘之类的东西输入歌单。然后你就得赶紧去重新输入，哎呀，糟了，我的歌单被取消了。我得赶紧把它重新输入进去。场面就更混乱了。我觉得肯定得找到一个合适的平衡点。
[00:07:05.570] how many people are in like the ideal group for karaoke. I think it's probably if I had to define it somewhere between like, eight to 12. And anything below or beyond that is very variable. Like I think eight to 12, you're like pretty much likely to have fun. But sub eight or over 12, it depends on the personalities, like how you guys are feeling, and way more factors. I don't know,
[00:07:05.570] 我觉得卡拉OK最理想的人数是多少？如果非要我定义的话，大概是8到12人吧。人数少于或超过这个范围就很难说了。我觉得8到12人的话，大家玩得应该都比较开心。但如果少于8人或者超过12人，那就得看大家的性格、心情等等很多因素了。我也不知道。
[00:07:31.890] I have a specific idea of what karaoke should look like, you know? Yeah. And if I don't think that's achievable, I don't push the issue. I'm not like we still have to go karaoke. What do you feel like is the idea of karaoke in your head? I guess I feel like if every single person is not having fun at karaoke, it's not worth going. That's fair. You know, because sometimes it's like you do something because someone really wants to do it. But I feel like with karaoke,
[00:07:31.890] 我对卡拉OK应该是什么样子有个具体的想法，你知道吗？是的。如果我觉得实现不了，我就不会强求。我不是说我们非得去唱卡拉OK不可。你觉得你心目中的卡拉OK应该是什么样的？我觉得如果每个人在唱卡拉OK的时候都玩得不开心，那就没必要去了。这很合理。你知道，有时候你做某件事是因为有人真的很想做。但我觉得卡拉OK，
[00:07:59.450] if you're not really having fun, you could just be sitting there for four hours. So then I feel like hopefully most people just take an Uber so people don't have to be like really sober in a corner or something. Like another thing is if you're going to mix friend groups, you have to mix the right people. You can't just try to get a head count. Because I've definitely done that before. And it just ends up kind of bad. You're right. I've also done that once before. And it was not the best,
[00:07:59.450] 如果你玩得不开心，可能就得在那儿坐四个小时。所以我感觉，希望大多数人都能打车，这样大家就不用在角落里那么清醒地待着了。还有一点，如果你要把不同的朋友聚在一起，就得确保聚的人合适。你不能只是随便数数。因为我以前就这么干过，结果往往不太好。你说得对，我也这么干过一次，而且结果并不理想。
[00:08:28.450] I would say. But what if you have a ton of people, maybe the people who aren't as into singing, go into their own corner and hang out basically. Because I think that's what happened at the birthday party we were at. Right. I guess I just feel like karaoke isn't cheap, right? I guess it depends on where you are at. But an hourly for karaoke, even if you're splitting it in a big group, it's not really going to be that cheap. So if you're not going to be able to sing,
[00:08:28.450] 我觉得是这样。但如果人很多呢？那些不太爱唱歌的人可能会躲到角落里各自待着。因为我觉得我们参加的那个生日派对就是这种情况。没错。我觉得卡拉OK并不便宜，对吧？我觉得这取决于你在哪里。但即使是人多的时候，按小时计费的卡拉OK也不会很便宜。所以如果你不会唱歌，
[00:08:55.490] because there's too many people that it's like kind of not worth. I kind of agree with you, Jisoo. At least for me, I feel like the ideal karaoke environment is one where everyone or like pretty much everyone is like really into it. And obviously, that'll come in like phases. And there's like waves of certain genres of songs. And I also have thoughts about that, which we can talk about later. But like, you know, there's in general, pretty much everyone is like really into it,
[00:08:55.490] 因为人太多了，感觉不太值得。我有点同意你的看法，Jisoo。至少对我来说，理想的卡拉OK环境是每个人，或者说几乎每个人，都非常投入。当然，这种状态也会随着时间推移而变化。某些类型的歌曲也会有流行浪潮。关于这一点我也有一些想法，我们以后可以再聊。但总的来说，你知道，几乎每个人都非常投入。
[00:09:24.290] people will naturally feel comfortable to like step up and take the mic at some point or like contribute, even if they don't want to fully sing a song by their self or with one other person, like if they just want to like yell the lyrics in the background, like that's fine too. But I feel like one where some people are not as into it as others or just like kind of talking in a corner, I feel the pressure to be like, this is not fun for you. So like, why are you here? Or like,
[00:09:24.290] 人们自然而然地会觉得自在，会在某个时候站出来拿起麦克风或者参与进来，即使他们不想独自或与他人合唱一首歌，比如只想在背景里大声喊歌词，那也没关系。但我感觉，如果有些人不像其他人那样投入，或者只是在角落里说话，我就会感到压力，觉得好像在说：“这对你来说不好玩。那你来这里干嘛？”或者类似这样的话。
[00:09:51.790] not why are you here? But like, but like, is there something that I that we could have done to make it better? I don't know. So I agree with not like the curation of people. But I feel like there are some people who just don't enjoy karaoke as much. And that's fine. But I do agree that the ideal scenario is that everyone's like really into it. And you're in like a properly sized room
[00:09:51.790] 不是问“你为什么来这儿？”，而是，我们能不能做些什么让情况变得更好？我不知道。所以我同意不应该刻意挑选人。但我感觉有些人就是不太喜欢卡拉OK。这也没关系。但我确实认为理想的情况是每个人都兴致勃勃，而且在一个大小合适的房间里。
[00:10:20.070] where it's like almost just not enough space. Just not in a space slightly dim. And the only light is from like the disco ball in the middle, have a table in the middle of everyone, everyone's kind of in a half circle. I feel like that really facilitates the ultimate karaoke vibe. That makes sense? Yeah. Okay, I have a question for y'all because I had to come to this understanding recently.
[00:10:20.070] 感觉空间有点不够用。光线也稍微暗一些。唯一的光源就是中间的迪斯科球，桌子放在大家中间，大家围成一个半圆。我觉得这样最能营造卡拉OK的氛围。你们明白我的意思吗？嗯。好的，我有个问题想问问大家，因为我最近才弄明白这一点。
[00:10:43.390] We are talking about Asian karaoke. Yes, but like not everyone grew up with this style of karaoke. So what I've noticed is one time I was in actually I was in Asia and we went to karaoke. The people I was with did not grow up with this like Asian like, you know, room style karaoke. So when people were given the mics, they all just like shut up. Everyone else who didn't have the mic, they just like,
[00:10:43.390] 我们现在说的是亚洲卡拉OK。是的，但并不是每个人都从小就接触这种卡拉OK。我注意到有一次我在亚洲，我们去唱卡拉OK。和我一起的人都没接触过这种亚洲式的、包厢式的卡拉OK。所以当有人拿到麦克风的时候，他们都安静了下来。而其他没拿到麦克风的人，他们就……
[00:11:13.390] zipped their mouths. This is your time. You have the mic. This is your show. Yeah. And I was like, oh my god, this is just different, you know. And I tried to explain. I was like, oh, usually it's totally okay to sing along. It's actually encouraged, blah, blah, blah. And they're like, yeah, we understand that. But I guess we're just like really used to the type where you just like go to a bar and like someone goes up on stage because they cued a song and it's their performance. Actually,
[00:11:13.390] 他们闭上了嘴。“这是你的时刻。你拿着麦克风。这是你的表演。”是啊。我当时就想，我的天，这感觉完全不一样。我试着解释。我说，哦，通常情况下，跟着唱完全没问题。实际上，我们鼓励大家这么做，等等等等。他们说，是啊，我们明白。但我想我们只是太习惯那种去酒吧，有人因为放了首歌就上台表演的模式了。实际上，
[00:11:40.790] that's a really good point. I wonder if it's also kind of a karaoke philosophy thing where I've been to Asia and done karaoke with people who grew up in Asia and then they did the same thing. They were like, oh, you can sing your favorite song. And then I was like, okay. I punched in some song and I was like, oh, we're all going to sing along. And then they didn't say anything. And they were just like waiting for me to slay. And I was like, I cannot work this song like you want me to work this song. You're like, I need backup singers.
[00:11:40.790] 你说的很有道理。我琢磨着，这或许也跟卡拉OK的理念有关。我去过亚洲，跟一些在亚洲长大的人一起唱过卡拉OK，他们也都做了同样的事。他们会说：“哦，你可以唱你最喜欢的歌。”然后我就说：“好啊。”我选了一首歌，心想：“哦，我们一起唱吧。”结果他们什么也没说，就等着我大显身手。我就说：“我唱不了你们想听的那种歌。”你们肯定会说：“我需要伴唱。”
[00:12:11.310] Like I need everyone to also be yelling so that you can't hear my voice. The mic is just a token. You're like, oops, the mic stopped working. I don't know why. Actually, that one was kind of interesting too, because this specifically happened in Korea and Korea also has a huge karaoke culture in itself with, I'm assuming a lot of subcultures and like different ideas of karaoke. But the people that I was with, I was kind of stumbling
[00:12:11.310] 就好像我需要大家一起大声喊叫，这样你就听不到我的声音了。麦克风只是个摆设。你会说，哎呀，麦克风坏了。我不知道为什么。其实，这件事也挺有意思的，因为它发生在韩国，而韩国本身就有非常浓厚的卡拉OK文化，我猜想那里有很多亚文化，对卡拉OK也有不同的理解。但我当时和那些人在一起，我有点磕磕绊绊的。
[00:12:39.930] on some of the lyrics. It was like a rap song, right? And I was kind of like, oh shit, I'm like losing the beat. And then they were like, do you want me to just skip it? Like, we'll just go on to the next song. And then I was like, okay, that's fine. And then we just skipped it and immediately went to the next song. And for a second, I was like, damn, I knew I was bad, but I was like, that's a little harsh, right? And then we get to the next song and the next person is singing. They sing like the first verse and then like the chorus, right? And then they're like, okay, just skip it. Go to the next song. Oh.
[00:12:39.930] 有些歌词我唱错了。感觉像是首说唱，对吧？我当时就想，糟了，我好像跟不上节奏了。然后他们就问我，要不要跳过这首歌？直接唱下一首。我说，好啊，没问题。然后我们就跳过了这首歌，直接唱下一首。我当时心里想，哎，我知道自己唱得不好，但这话也太狠了吧？然后我们唱到下一首，下一个人开始唱。他们唱了第一段和副歌，对吧？然后他们就说，好了，跳过这首歌吧，直接唱下一首。哦。
[00:13:06.870] And I was like, oh my God, we're just fucking speed running karaoke here. And I realized that's like another thing that people do because they don't want to like waste time or like spend too long on one of those songs with like a 50 second bridge or something. Yeah. Or they're like, oh shoot, I only know the chorus. They're like, okay, skip it. Dang, interesting. I feel like when I was in Japan, I would go karaoke at least once a
[00:13:06.870] 我当时就想，我的天，我们这是在速唱卡拉OK吗？我意识到，这其实是人们为了节省时间，不想在那些有50秒过渡段的歌上花太多时间而采取的另一种方式。是啊。或者他们会说，哎呀，我只会副歌。他们会说，好吧，跳过吧。哎，真有意思。我觉得我在日本的时候，至少会去唱一次卡拉OK。
[00:13:31.970] week probably honestly. Cause I lived really close to this karaoke place. I would normally just go with one or two other friends. It's like me and another person or like me and like two other people. And so actually what we did very often was we would have like shared songs that we would both sing along to, but we would also kind of like take turns to like sing our
[00:13:31.970] 大概一周吧。因为我住的地方离这家卡拉OK厅很近。我通常会和一两个朋友一起去。比如我和另一个人，或者我和另外两个人。我们经常会一起唱一些共同喜欢的歌，然后轮流唱自己的部分。
[00:13:57.890] songs ourselves. And then eventually like I started to know the songs that my friends would queue that would be their solo songs. And then they would start to know the songs that I would like to queue. And so it kind of morphed into that, but there was a period where, yeah, it was a lot more kind of like solos trading off. But I will say that the one time that I did go with a bigger group, it was so interesting because the friends that I had that I would go
[00:13:57.890] 我们自己先唱一些歌。然后慢慢地，我开始知道我的朋友们会播放哪些独唱曲目。之后他们也开始知道我想播放哪些歌。就这样慢慢演变成这样，但有一段时间，确实是大家轮流独唱。不过，有一次我和一群人一起去，那次经历非常有趣，因为我的朋友们会一起去。
[00:14:23.910] with most often, they were also foreigners like from Australia or like Canada or whatever. But the one time that I went with a larger group with a larger, actually Japanese group of people, they like took off their shoes and started like jumping on the like couches and stuff. I was like, Whoa, I've never done this like ever in my life, but it was like a group thing. And it was really fun. They would just put on songs and everybody took off their shoes, jumping on the couches.
[00:14:23.910] 大多数时候，他们也都是外国人，比如来自澳大利亚、加拿大之类的。但有一次，我跟一群人去，其中有一群是日本人，他们脱掉鞋子，开始在沙发上蹦来蹦去。我当时就想，哇，我这辈子都没这么玩过，但感觉像是集体活动。真的很有趣。他们会放歌，然后大家都脱掉鞋子，在沙发上蹦来蹦去。
[00:14:51.370] And we were just like all yelling and it was like very chaotic. But yeah, I've never had that kind of experience before. Wait, that's so funny. Wait, try doing that next time. Something about the taking off the shoes part is so crazy to me. I feel like it's so crazy too, because Japanese people are known to be very like polite and like they even clap softly and to imagine them just take their shoes off. I was very confused.
[00:14:51.370] 我们当时都大声喊叫，场面非常混乱。是啊，我以前从来没经历过这种事。等等，这太搞笑了。等等，下次你也试试。脱鞋那件事让我觉得很不可思议。我也觉得很不可思议，因为日本人出了名的有礼貌，连鼓掌都会轻柔地进行，想象一下他们突然就脱鞋，真是让人摸不着头脑。我当时真的非常困惑。
[00:15:20.670] I was the only non Japanese person there. And this was with actually my little group because I was in an acapella group there. So it was like with my I guess, like group mates or whatever. So we were already like used to hearing each other sing and stuff like that. But we've never gone to karaoke together before. So that that was our first time going. But I mean, they all just took off their shoes and started jumping very naturally on the couch. So I'm guessing this is what Japanese people normally do as well. So that's what the couches are for.
[00:15:20.670] 我是那里唯一的非日本人。当时我和我的小团体一起去的，因为我在一个无伴奏合唱团里。所以，大概就是和我的队友们一起吧。我们平时就经常听彼此唱歌什么的。但我们之前从来没一起去过卡拉OK。所以这是我们第一次去。我的意思是，他们都脱了鞋，很自然地在沙发上蹦来蹦去。所以我猜日本人平时也都是这么做的。看来沙发就是用来干这个的。
[00:15:50.550] Yeah. And to think we've just been sitting on them this whole time. Although I will say I've been to karaoke with people who dance before. I mean, you guys know me. I'm not like going to be dancing at karaoke. The most I'll do is like jump for like 10 minutes straight and like yell the lyrics with my hands up. That's like my version of karaoke dancing. But once I went to karaoke and one of our friends started like twerking on the wall. Oh my God.
[00:15:50.550] 是啊。想想我们之前一直就这么坐着呢。不过我得说，我以前也和会跳舞的人一起去过卡拉OK。你们也知道我，我可不会在卡拉OK跳舞。我最多也就是蹦蹦跳跳十分钟，举着手大声唱歌词。这就是我唱卡拉OK的方式。但有一次我去卡拉OK，我们一个朋友居然开始对着墙扭臀。我的天哪。
[00:16:15.310] And I was like, I've never seen like this is like a culture shock to me. And I was like, does this person think we're just fucking boring because we're just like sitting there on the couch? Oh my God. Wait, that's so funny. Sometimes they excited people be like stand up when like you get the mic. And I'm like, no, I will keep sitting. No, thank you. Well, sometimes I feel like my ass gets hella sweaty when I'm in karaoke. Because you're sitting
[00:16:15.310] 我当时就想，我从来没见过这种场面，这对我来说简直是文化冲击。我就想，这个人是不是觉得我们坐在沙发上很无聊？我的天哪。等等，这太搞笑了。有时候那些兴奋的人会说，拿到麦克风就站起来。我就说，不，我还是坐着吧。不，谢谢。嗯，有时候我觉得唱卡拉OK的时候屁股都出汗了。因为是坐着的。
[00:16:43.230] on like, I don't know how to describe it, like pleather maybe? Yeah. And it like, depending on what you're wearing, sometimes I get really like sweaty and also it's hot in like a karaoke usually. And then when people stand up, I'm like, oh God. You have to reveal your under thigh sweat. Yeah, exactly. I guess it also depends on like how drunk I am. If I'm more drunk, I'm more likely to be more lively. But yeah.
[00:16:43.230] 就像……我不知道该怎么形容，有点像人造革？嗯。而且，根据你穿的衣服，有时候我会出很多汗，卡拉OK里通常也很热。然后当人们站起来的时候，我就想，我的天哪。你得露出大腿内侧的汗。对，没错。我觉得这也取决于我喝了多少。我越醉，就越有可能更活跃。嗯。
[00:17:11.930] Okay. Actually, this is like a personal thing in karaoke, but I like to get the mic when people are taking shots so that I can avoid drinking. I'm like, oh yeah, I'm busy singing this song. Sure. That's the reason. Of course, I'm also enjoying singing this song. But like, it is a big reason to help me like stay pretty sober during karaoke. Because it's pretty dangerous. You get pretty drunk. People are very excited usually.
[00:17:11.930] 好吧。其实，这算是卡拉OK里我的一个小习惯，我喜欢在大家喝酒的时候拿到麦克风，这样我就能避免喝酒了。我会说，哦，对啊，我正忙着唱歌呢。当然，这就是原因。当然，我也很享受唱歌的过程。但这确实是我在卡拉OK里保持清醒的一个重要原因。因为卡拉OK真的挺危险的。很容易喝醉。而且大家通常都很兴奋。
[00:17:42.070] Yeah. Because I feel like it's like your personal backtrack right to a moment. And I think what we like to do when we go karaoke is like sing a lot of throwback songs. And I just get transported back to like my middle school angsty, like us against the world type of attitude. So totally agree with karaoke being dangerous sometimes. Yeah. I will say though, I feel like a lot of the times when I go with less people, it's to karaoke.
[00:17:42.070] 是啊。因为我觉得它就像是把你带回过去某个时刻。而且我觉得我们去唱卡拉OK的时候喜欢唱很多老歌。我感觉自己一下子回到了中学时代那种叛逆、觉得自己无所不能的状态。所以完全同意卡拉OK有时候确实挺危险的。嗯。不过话说回来，我觉得很多时候我和朋友少的时候，都是去唱卡拉OK。
[00:18:08.510] It's not to drink or it'll be like sober karaoke. But like big group or larger group karaoke is definitely more of like a opportunity to drink. Wait, that's so interesting. Now that I think about it, I've never had like sober karaoke. Really? Yeah, that's like super rare for me, I have to say. I think it's just the groups that we go in. I think like karaoke is, yeah, like an opportunity
[00:18:08.510] 不是说要喝酒，不然就跟清醒卡拉OK一样了。但像那种大型团体卡拉OK，绝对更像是喝酒的机会。等等，这真有意思。现在想想，我好像从来没参加过清醒卡拉OK。真的吗？是啊，对我来说真的非常罕见。我觉得这可能跟我们一起去的团体有关。我觉得卡拉OK，嗯，就像是一个喝酒的机会。
[00:18:34.470] to drink while also letting go of your because sometimes it's like without a shot in you, you're too shy to sing. Right. We're releasing our innovation. Kind of talking about the etiquette part of karaoke. Crystal, what you said about how some people can be too shy if we're not drinking. I feel like you get a little bit of that at the start of karaoke.
[00:18:34.470] 喝酒的同时也要放松一下，因为有时候不喝酒，你会害羞得不敢唱歌。没错。我们正在推出我们的创新。我们想谈谈卡拉OK的礼仪。Crystal，你刚才说有些人如果不喝酒就会太害羞。我觉得在卡拉OK刚开始的时候确实会有点这种感觉。
[00:19:03.050] So it's very important at the beginning to like set up the right songs. And you need to have like somebody who because I feel like people who are too shy to take the mic will also usually be too shy to cue things. Because then if you cue it, the expectation is that you will take the mic. And so I feel like you need the person at the beginning to cue a bunch of really lit hype songs that like pretty
[00:19:03.050] 所以，一开始准备合适的歌曲非常重要。你需要找个人来负责，因为我觉得那些害羞不敢拿起麦克风的人，通常也不敢提示歌曲。因为如果你提示了，大家就会期待你拿起麦克风。所以我觉得你需要有人在一开始就提示一些非常嗨、非常能带动气氛的歌曲。
[00:19:30.550] much everyone will know and enjoy and be able to participate in to like get that going. And you also cannot be shy to take the mic like you need somebody who is down to like belt out a song or two or like to at least get the mic and get other people singing in the background. And then somebody else as well, who's depending on the drunkenness level of the group already to like start passing around the
[00:19:30.550] 每个人都会知道、都会喜欢，并且都能参与其中，让气氛活跃起来。你也不能害羞，要敢于拿起麦克风，你需要有人愿意放声高歌一两首，或者至少拿起麦克风带动其他人一起合唱。然后还需要另一个人，根据大家目前的醉酒程度，开始传递……
[00:19:57.390] shots, you know, to like, be like, okay, like this is happening. Like this is to like set the mood and like get people to start drinking more. Until naturally, when people see other people are like comfortable going for the mic, they'll also be more comfortable going for the mic. But you have to set the precedent in the beginning. Completely agree. Like there are roles in the beginning. I'm usually the cure. I think I often take that role too. It's important to set it up. And I've had
[00:19:57.390] 你知道，先放几句，就好像在说，“好吧，事情就是这样。” 这样做是为了营造气氛，让大家开始多喝点。直到自然而然地，当人们看到其他人都能轻松地拿起麦克风时，他们也会更自在地拿起麦克风。但你必须在一开始就树立榜样。完全同意。就像一开始要分工合作一样。我通常是负责活跃气氛的人。我想我经常扮演这个角色。铺垫很重要。而且我曾经……
[00:20:25.690] a lot of lessons too. Because I think not only do you have to set up the beginning, but to an extent, you can't play songs that are such bangers that you need a reserve for the peak. Exactly. So they have to be kind of like boring crowd pleasers. Like think like Katy Perry and not Pipple. True. Or if it's like, if one artist has some really popular songs, you've got to save their best
[00:20:25.690] 也需要好好学习很多东西。因为我觉得不仅要做好开场，而且在某种程度上，你不能一开始就放那种太炸裂的歌，以至于需要留点余地来烘托气氛。没错。所以它们必须有点像那种让人觉得无聊但很讨喜的歌。想想凯蒂·佩里（Katy Perry）的歌，而不是皮普尔（Pipple）的。确实如此。或者，如果一个歌手有一些非常流行的歌曲，你就得把他们最好的歌留到最后。
[00:20:52.630] song for like a third of the way in or like half of the way in. Or you have to like time them at least maybe like three or four songs in you get like waves of hypeness. You know, it's like, oh shit, like this song is up. Like, if you haven't been screaming your heart out at this point, like this is your time to come out like nobody like no child left behind. You need to come out. Hopefully,
[00:20:52.630] 这首歌大概唱到三分之一或者一半的时候，你就会开始兴奋起来。或者你得把握好节奏，至少唱到三四首歌的时候，你会感受到一波又一波的兴奋。你知道，就像，哦，天哪，这首歌要开始了。如果你到现在还没放声呐喊，现在就是你该爆发的时候了，就像“不让任何一个孩子掉队”一样。你必须爆发出来。希望如此。
[00:21:20.290] you've gotten like two shots in now and like, you know, some people have passed around the mic and everything already. But like you have that first really lit song. And then you know, some more cruisers, and hopefully people have like cued other songs that they actually want to sing. And then you have like moments of really big crowd pleasers. That's also very popular at the moment. So totally agree
[00:21:20.290] 现在已经放了两首歌了，你知道，有些人已经把麦克风传来传去什么的了。但是第一首歌真的嗨翻全场。然后你知道，还有一些比较舒缓的歌，希望大家也能提前唱一些自己真正想唱的歌。然后就会出现一些真正能让全场沸腾的歌曲。这种形式现在也很流行。所以完全同意。
[00:21:44.110] with timing it. Yeah, I feel like those really lit songs at those points, you can almost just thrust the mic into anyone's hands. And they'll hopefully at that point be accepting of it. And just like even if just for a line or two, or like the chorus, and then they can pass the mic off. And those are like, when everyone truly gets into it. You know what I love? It's when like the shy people, you can tell that they're shy in the beginning, or like they don't go karaoke very often or whatever. And then like the lit
[00:21:44.110] 把握好时机。是啊，我觉得那些特别嗨的歌，到了那种程度，你几乎可以把麦克风塞到任何人手里。他们那时候应该也会欣然接受。哪怕只是唱一两句，或者唱个副歌，然后就可以把麦克风传给下一个人。那时候，大家都能真正投入进去。你知道我最喜欢什么吗？就是那些一开始比较害羞的人，你能看出他们很害羞，或者他们不常去唱卡拉OK什么的。然后，就像……嗨起来了。
[00:22:14.010] song comes up, you just hear them in the background go like, or like, I love this song. And then you can and then I'm like, I'm the one usually with the mic and I'll like shove it in their hands be like, Oh my god, it's your turn queen or like whatever, you know. And then they can't say no, they can pass it off at that point. So you're like, I heard you. I heard what you said. I see you. I see you. This
[00:22:14.010] 歌曲响起的时候，你会听到他们在背景里说，比如“我喜欢这首歌”。然后，我通常拿着麦克风，我会把麦克风塞到他们手里，说：“我的天哪，轮到你了，女王！”或者诸如此类的话，你知道的。这样他们就没法拒绝了，他们只能接受。所以你会想：“我听到了。我听到了你说的话。我看到了。我看到了。”
[00:22:37.130] is your time. Damn, you're like emceeing the karaoke. Follow up question to that. Do you think you also kind of look at if someone holds the mic for a long time and then try to like pass it away from that person? I think I do keep an eye out on the cue list. So if I notice because usually, you know, if one person's going up to I guess it differs. But like, if it's like the machine kind, where you
[00:22:37.130] 轮到你了。天哪，你简直像在主持卡拉OK。接着问个问题。你会不会也留意一下有没有人长时间拿着麦克风，然后赶紧把麦克风递给别人？我觉得我会留意提示单。因为我注意到，通常情况下，你知道，如果一个人上去……我想情况会不一样。但是，如果是那种机器式的，你
[00:23:06.820] have to like search for songs, then usually the same person songs will be cued in a row. Right? Versus if it's like the booklet old school kind, like that might be passed around a little bit more frequently. So you might get naturally the cue might be a little bit more mixed up. But if it's the machine kind, usually I'll like keep an eye out on the cue list. And then I'll like move songs up and
[00:23:06.820] 如果是那种需要搜索歌曲的机器，通常同一个人唱的歌会连续播放。对吧？但如果是老式的纸质歌单，播放频率可能会更高一些。所以播放顺序自然会比较混乱。但如果是机器点歌，我通常会留意播放列表。然后我会把想听的歌往前挪，
[00:23:32.560] down. Oh, I'll prioritize certain songs if I feel like there's a big chunk of like similar style or like similar vibe songs, you know, because you got to like switch it up a little bit to keep things spicy. To keep everyone interested. Also to give people a break, you know? Wow, dude, you are truly MC. I'm out here thinking about it. You're like the karaoke mastermind. She's playing chess and we're playing checkers.
[00:23:32.560] 哦，如果我觉得有很多歌风格或氛围相似，我会优先考虑某些歌，你知道，因为得稍微换换花样，才能保持新鲜感，让大家都感兴趣。也让大家休息一下，你知道吗？哇，兄弟，你真是个说唱歌手。我在这儿琢磨呢。你简直就是卡拉OK大师。她在下国际象棋，我们在下跳棋。
[00:24:02.800] I'm like, damn, should we be controlling the vibe like that next time? Like we should adjust the cue more. We should. Because you're totally right. It's very easy. You know, someone finally gets the input machine or pad or whatever. And then they cue like maybe three or four songs. And then it's going to be clumped together, which is also totally fine. But sometimes it's like a solo song maybe, or it's like a little bit more niche of a song. So it's like good to mix it up.
[00:24:02.800] 我当时就想，哎，下次我们是不是也应该这样控制一下氛围？比如我们应该更精准地调整一下提示音。确实应该。因为你说得完全对。这很容易做到。你知道，有人终于拿到了输入设备或者打击垫之类的东西。然后他们可能就点了三四首歌。这样一来，这些歌就会挤在一起，这也没什么问题。但有时候，可能是一首独唱歌曲，或者一首比较小众的歌。所以，最好是把不同的歌曲穿插播放。
[00:24:29.200] Also, usually at the beginning, you know, people are like furiously cueing songs. And then it like kind of dies down after a bit, right? With like cueing new songs. Sometimes you get a lot of filler songs. And, you know, you thought about or like people thought about and they cued it, but it's not actually a banger. And so sometimes you got to like keep an eye out on the cue list so that the ones that are cued later can have a chance to make it to the top. Sometimes, you know, like the shyer people who
[00:24:29.200] 而且，通常一开始，你知道，大家都会疯狂地点歌。过一会儿，这种热情就会慢慢消退，对吧？点新歌的时候也会少一些。有时候你会听到很多凑数的歌。你知道，你可能想到了，或者其他人想到了，也点了，但其实并不怎么火。所以有时候你得留意一下点歌列表，这样后面点的歌才有机会脱颖而出。有时候，你知道，像那些比较害羞的人……
[00:24:57.940] don't cue stuff in the beginning, I want to make sure that their song, they get to actually hear their songs come up. And so usually, if you know, it's like halfway through and people are still cuing new songs, I'll like go in there and like move it to the top. So they haven't like they'll actually come up before, you know, like two or three hours is over. Dude, I'm gonna have to pay
[00:24:57.940] 别在开头就放歌，我想确保他们的歌能真正播放出来。所以通常情况下，如果演出进行到一半，还有人放新歌，我就会进去把新歌移到最前面。这样，他们的歌就不会在两三个小时结束前就播放出来。哥们，我得付钱了。
[00:25:17.520] attention next time because sometimes the cue does change. Now that I think about it, all of the last times that I've been karaokeing with Jessica, she always sits at the corner by the TV. And I always thought it was just like the order of which you walk into the room and like slide on the onto the
[00:25:17.520] 下次注意点，因为提示音有时候会变。现在想想，我最近几次和杰西卡一起唱卡拉OK，她总是坐在电视机旁边的角落里。我一直以为这就像你走进房间的顺序，然后滑到……
[00:25:41.950] couch. But now I know it's strategic, dude. She's controlling the vibes. She's keeping them up. True. She's optimizing karaoke. Dude, I'm all about efficiency. Well, I feel like it's very clear that just because the karaoke host MC, but Crystal, what do you think your archetype is in karaoke? Okay, mine has evolved because actually, I used to be really,
[00:25:41.950] 沙发。但现在我知道这是策略，老兄。她在掌控气氛，让气氛持续高涨。没错，她是在优化卡拉OK体验。老兄，我追求的是效率。嗯，我觉得很明显，卡拉OK主持人是MC，但是Crystal，你觉得你在卡拉OK中的原型是什么？好吧，我的原型已经改变了，因为实际上，我以前真的很……
[00:26:11.370] really shy for karaoke. Back in college, I think I really needed to like have some drinks in me to be able to participate. But the thing is, like, I love singing. But I think it's just like the idea of singing in front of people. It's like, oh, God. But then I started to realize kind of what we've been talking about. Like, you need someone in the beginning to just like take charge, take the mic, because honestly, probably 80% of the people are feeling a little shy. And it's a little awkward,
[00:26:11.370] 我真的非常害羞，不敢去唱卡拉OK。大学的时候，我觉得我得喝点酒才能参与。其实，我很喜欢唱歌。但我觉得在人前唱歌就是个问题。天哪。不过后来我开始意识到我们一直在讨论的那个道理。你需要有人在一开始就掌控局面，拿起麦克风，因为说实话，大概有80%的人都会有点害羞。而且场面会有点尴尬。
[00:26:41.110] just like Jessica said. I guess like I had to let go of that fear a bit and be like, dude, even if you're not good, you're not good. It's shaky in the beginning, someone just has to get it started. And then people will feel more comfortable and slowly feel braver to like ask for the mic. But this has evolved
[00:26:41.110] 就像杰西卡说的那样。我想我得稍微放下那种恐惧，告诉自己，就算你唱得不好，也没关系。一开始会有点不稳，总得有人先抛砖引玉。然后大家就会感觉更自在，慢慢地也更有勇气去争取麦克风。但事情已经发展到这个阶段了。
[00:27:01.010] into I tend to just have the mic a lot because of a couple things. One is I'm avoiding drinking. Two, I do really like singing and it helped a lot to like let go of that fear. I do try to pass the mic off. I'll be like, oh, anyone want it for this song? But if no one wants it, I'll just keep it. Dude, I'm not gonna lie. I don't remember a ton of times where you've asked people
[00:27:01.010] 我经常拿着麦克风，原因有二。一是我戒酒了。二是我真的很喜欢唱歌，克服唱歌的恐惧感对我帮助很大。我也会尽量把麦克风传给别人。我会问：“有人想用麦克风唱这首歌吗？”但如果没人要，我就自己留着。老兄，说实话，我印象中你好像没怎么问过别人要麦克风。
[00:27:28.510] wait, after every song, unless it's like a song I cued, I'll be like, does anyone want this mic? Crystal like holds it out like an inch from her face. She's like, yeah, that's more right. I actually put it onto the table. I don't know. And if no one takes it, I take it back. I mean, I'm sure there's times you do it, but I've I swear unless I cued the song,
[00:27:28.510] 等等，每首歌唱完，除非是我事先安排好的歌，否则我都会问：“有人要这个麦克风吗？”克丽丝塔尔会把麦克风举到离脸只有一英寸的地方。她说：“对，这样更合适。”我其实是把它放在桌子上的。我也不知道为什么。如果没人要，我就把它拿回去。我的意思是，我肯定你也会这么做，但我发誓，除非是我事先安排好的歌，否则我不会这么做。
[00:27:54.610] I'll always put the mic back on the table. I actually have this specific story that I'm thinking of where we were at karaoke. We were at karaoke. Wait, Crystal looks like she's so attacked right now. It's okay. This is a funny story. Once we were at karaoke with like a big group of people and then a bunch of people had like cued their own songs. It was kind of one of those karaoke's
[00:27:54.610] 我总是会把麦克风放回桌子上。我其实想起一个我们去唱卡拉OK的故事。我们当时在唱卡拉OK。等等，Crystal现在看起来好像被攻击了一样。没关系。这其实是个很有趣的故事。有一次我们和一大群人一起去唱卡拉OK，然后很多人都点了自己的歌。那感觉就像是那种……
[00:28:19.390] where people were taking a little bit longer to get into it. Like I feel like we didn't pregame to maybe like the optimal level. So it was kind of like a warmup period. But then the songs that people cued started coming up, right? And I just remember like a song came up and then Crystal had sang like a couple of songs in a row. And then you were holding the mic and I was like looking at the mic and I was like, I wonder if she's going to pass it off. And then you were like, the song title
[00:28:19.390] 当时大家进入状态的时间有点长。感觉我们可能没有达到最佳状态。所以有点像热身。但之后大家点的歌就开始响了，对吧？我记得当时一首歌响起，然后Crystal连续唱了好几首。然后你拿着麦克风，我看着麦克风，心想，她会不会把麦克风交给我呢？然后你就说，歌名。
[00:28:46.930] came up and you were like, oh, I know the song. And I was like, damn, that's like the bar. Like if you know it or not. When you said like put the mic on the table, I was imagining like, you know, in the Egyptian war when you have to like slap in or like slap and then you have like people's hands are like hovering over the center of the car. Like Crystal's just like, she puts the mic down and her hand is just like, oh, like no one's going to take it. No one's going to take it.
[00:28:46.930] 你走过来，说：“哦，我知道这首歌。” 我当时就想，天哪，这简直就是酒吧的标配。不管你知不知道这首歌。你说把麦克风放在桌子上的时候，我脑海里浮现出埃及战争的场景，你知道，就像那种需要拍击的场景，然后人们的手都悬在车中央。就像Crystal那样，她把麦克风放下来，她的手就像在说：“哦，没人会拿走它。没人会拿走它。”
[00:29:14.950] There was this phase where like I've noticed a lot of people would cue up songs and then they'd get really shy and like stop singing maybe halfway through or something or like after a couple lines or like, oh shoot, no one knows this song. Like maybe we can just skip it. What I discovered helping was I would be like, oh wait, I kind of know this song. I'll just like try my best to sing it with
[00:29:14.950] 我注意到，很多人会先准备一些歌曲，然后突然变得很害羞，唱到一半就停下来，或者唱了几句就停了下来，然后说：“糟了，没人会唱这首歌，我们还是跳过吧。” 我发现一个很有用的办法是，我会想：“等等，我好像会唱这首歌。” 然后我会尽力跟着唱。
[00:29:40.620] you. And then that would get them hyped up and they would keep singing their song. So during that phase, yeah, the bar was basically like, oh, I know the song. Like I can help whoever cued the song sing it if that's needed. But then if I get like drunk, things get out of control. So actually, if I sing a little more at the right times and avoid drinking, it helps control the flow better. Like I'll be like putting the mic back and like giving it around.
[00:29:40.620] 你。然后他们就会兴奋起来，继续唱他们的歌。所以在那段时间，酒吧里基本上就是，哦，我知道这首歌。如果需要的话，我可以帮负责提示的人一起唱。但如果我喝醉了，事情就会失控。所以实际上，如果我在合适的时机多唱几句，并且避免喝酒，就能更好地控制节奏。比如我会把麦克风递回去，让大家轮流唱。
[00:30:10.600] Wait, I just remembered another funny story about Crystal and Kofi. This was, this is Juicy at your birthday last year. Oh no. I don't know if you know. Okay, this one, I was like, I was like gone for a bit. Exactly. So we were all like, this was like the end of towards the end of the night and we were all on the couch at Juicy's house. And so this was like
[00:30:10.600] 等等，我突然想起Crystal和Kofi的另一个趣事。这是去年Juicy在你生日那天拍的。哦不。我不知道你知不知道。好吧，当时我有点走神。没错。那天晚上快结束的时候，我们都在Juicy家的沙发上。然后就发生了这样的事……
[00:30:34.920] YouTube karaoke. I forgot what song it was. It might've been, it was a Sabrina. Oh no, you're right. It was a Sabrina song. We cued it and we did it. And Crystal did it. Like she had the mic and she sang the song and we were all like, you know, yelling in the back, singing along and everything. And then maybe three songs later, we're singing other stuff. Crystal suddenly like,
[00:30:34.920] YouTube卡拉OK。我忘了是什么歌了。可能是，是《萨布丽娜》里的歌。哦不，你说得对。就是《萨布丽娜》里的歌。我们点了歌，然后就开始唱了。是克丽丝塔尔唱的。她拿着麦克风唱，我们所有人都在后面跟着，大声喊着，跟着一起唱。然后大概过了三首歌，我们就开始唱别的歌了。克丽丝塔尔突然说，
[00:31:00.400] oh my God, we need to sing that Sabrina Carpenter song. And I was like, what? And she was like, no, we need to cue it. Like we need to sing it. I was like, dude, we sang it like five minutes ago. What are you talking about? And she was like, what? That's, that's when I came back. I know. You came too. That was so funny. Dude, that was actually so trippy for me. Cause I was like,
[00:31:00.400] 我的天哪，我们得唱那首萨布丽娜·卡朋特的歌。我当时就懵了，什么？她说，不，我们得先放个提示。就像我们得唱一样。我说，老兄，我们五分钟前才唱过。你在说什么？她说，什么？就在那时，我回过神来。我知道。你也回来了。那太搞笑了。老兄，那对我来说简直太奇妙了。因为我当时就想，
[00:31:25.400] wait, what? I was like, wait, what? And then I was also like, wait, what? I was collectively confused. I feel like this sounds like a catch 22. It's like, if you're singing and like holding the mic, you're avoiding drinking. So you don't develop into M dot aging, AKA mic dot hogging. But if you
[00:31:25.400] 等等，什么？我当时就懵了，等等，什么？然后我又懵了，等等，什么？我当时完全懵了。我觉得这听起来像个两难困境。就好像，如果你唱歌，拿着麦克风，你就避免喝酒。这样你就不会养成“麦克风霸占症”（M. aging），也就是所谓的“麦克风霸占症”。但是如果你
[00:31:51.520] are drinking, that means you're not singing. And then later you might M dot age. So it's like, it's like a timing issue. Like you want to front load it or back load it? Exactly. Exactly. So like, I prefer not to pregame karaoke cause then I can just like slowly also because I feel like sometimes, as I said, people are just really excited at karaoke. So then like the drinks are flowing and I'm like, dude, I'm not trying to drink so much.
[00:31:51.520] 喝酒的话，就意味着你不会唱歌。然后过段时间你可能还会喝到……（此处原文疑似拼写错误，无法准确翻译）。所以这就像是一个时间安排的问题。你是想提前唱还是后天唱？没错，没错。所以我不喜欢在唱卡拉OK之前先喝点酒，因为那样我可以慢慢来。而且我觉得有时候，就像我说的，大家唱卡拉OK的时候都很兴奋。然后酒水就源源不断地来了，我就想，老兄，我可不想喝那么多。
[00:32:20.920] Yeah. Honestly, all jokes aside, I know we're totally clowning Crystal, but Crystal is not actually like a really bad mic hog. And it was recently proved we went to karaoke and it was with some people that we had just met. And then we were like sharing the running joke of like, Oh, Crystal's a mic hog. Ha ha ha. And then at the end of karaoke, they were like, Oh, you're not even a mic hog. And we're like, yeah, we're just meeting. I was like, guys, I told you.
[00:32:20.920] 是啊。说真的，不开玩笑，我知道我们一直在拿Crystal开玩笑，但她其实不是那种特别爱抢麦克风的人。最近我们去唱卡拉OK，和一些刚认识的人一起去的，结果证明我们之前就一直在开玩笑说Crystal爱抢麦克风。哈哈哈哈。结果唱完之后，他们说：“哦，你根本不爱抢麦克风。” 我们说：“是啊，我们才刚认识。” 我当时就说：“伙计们，我早就跟你们说了。”
[00:32:46.800] But I do agree that you need to have someone who's willing to sing a lot of songs. One of the worst parts about karaoke is sometimes it'll be like silent, or like really quiet or like dead or something. And I think part of the social contract of going karaoke in my mind, at least is like you have to come with the vibes, which means even if it's not my favorite song, I'll still try to sing along or like be hype or like do the phone flashlight thing or whatever and like, stay somewhat
[00:32:46.800] 但我同意，你需要一个愿意唱很多歌的人。卡拉OK最糟糕的地方之一就是有时候会很安静，或者特别冷清，气氛很沉闷。我觉得去卡拉OK的社交约定之一，至少在我看来，就是你要融入气氛，这意味着即使不是我最喜欢的歌，我也会试着跟着唱，或者让自己兴奋起来，或者用手机闪光灯照照什么的，总之，保持一定的参与度。
[00:33:15.920] engaged. Otherwise, it just gets really awkward in the room. I agree. I feel like engagement is 90% of it. Okay, so I kind of want to break down because I feel like it's very clear that we all very much so enjoy karaoke. What do you think are your specific favorite parts about karaoke? I think for me, it's actually specific moments that you remember in passing. The moment that I'm thinking of is like,
[00:33:15.920] 投入其中。否则，房间里的气氛会变得非常尴尬。我同意。我觉得投入度占了90%。好吧，我想详细说说，因为我觉得很明显我们都很喜欢卡拉OK。你觉得卡拉OK最让你喜欢的部分是什么？对我来说，其实是一些转瞬即逝的美好瞬间。我想到的那个瞬间是这样的：
[00:33:43.240] you know when there's a really, really good song up that everyone knows and loves. It's like from our childhood, or the most popular song nowadays, whatever. And you're like singing, you know, there's like two people on each mic singing into the mic together. And then you like look around the room and everyone's singing, like half of them have their eyes closed. Like I live for that. You know, it's like rapturous. And it kind of actually takes me back. This is like maybe a little bit sacrilegious, but it kind of takes me back to like, back when I used to be religious,
[00:33:43.240] 你知道那种感觉吗？就是那种特别好听的歌，大家都耳熟能详，都喜欢。可能是我们小时候听的，也可能是现在最流行的歌，随便什么都行。然后你跟着唱，你知道，两个人对着麦克风一起唱。你环顾四周，发现每个人都在唱，好像有一半人都闭着眼睛。我就是喜欢这种感觉。你知道，那种感觉简直太美妙了。它真的会把我带回过去。这么说可能有点亵渎神明，但它真的会让我想起我以前信教的时候。
[00:34:11.620] we would sing songs together at church and whatnot. And there's like this specific feeling that arises from like singing together. And karaoke has been the closest thing to me, post religion of like replicating that feeling. So karaoke is almost religious too. It is. We should throw in some Christian rock next time.
[00:34:11.620] 我们以前会在教堂什么的一起唱歌。一起唱歌会产生一种特别的感觉。对我来说，宗教信仰消失后，卡拉OK是最接近这种感觉的方式。所以卡拉OK也几乎算是一种宗教活动。确实如此。下次我们应该放点基督教摇滚。
[00:34:36.860] Actually, sometimes I sneak it in. Like the songs that don't seem very religious, I sneak it in. Wait, what? Like what? Like Be My Escape by Ruliant K or Show Me What I'm Looking For by Carolina Liar. I'll sneak those in sometimes. And they're Christian. Dare You To Move, Switchfoot? I don't know that song. Wait, that sounds familiar. I feel like a lot of these songs I don't know by title. I feel like when you hear it, you would know it. Okay, so next karaoke session, we'll be sure to sneak in some more Christian rock.
[00:34:36.860] 其实，有时候我会偷偷加进去一些。比如那些听起来不太像宗教歌曲的歌，我会偷偷加进去。等等，什么？比如什么？比如Ruliant K的《Be My Escape》或者Carolina Liar的《Show Me What I'm Looking For》。我有时候会偷偷加进去这些。而且它们都是基督教歌曲。Switchfoot的《Dare You To Move》？我不认识这首歌。等等，这听起来有点耳熟。我觉得很多歌我都不知道歌名。但我觉得你一听就知道是哪首。好吧，下次卡拉OK的时候，我们一定要多加一些基督教摇滚。
[00:35:06.300] Yeah. And then we can hold hands and cry. And pray. Yeah. I think my favorite part of karaoke, I mean, I also just really genuinely love singing. So there's that. I mean, it depends on the song, but I think I actually prefer to not be on the mic. I feel like those are usually the times when I have the most fun. When it's like other people are really into it, because I'm always really into it. So I like it
[00:35:06.300] 是啊。然后我们可以手牵手哭，一起祈祷。嗯。我觉得卡拉OK最棒的地方在于，我真的非常喜欢唱歌。所以就是这样。当然，这也要看歌，但我其实更喜欢不唱歌。我觉得不唱歌的时候我反而最开心。因为大家都很投入，而我总是很投入。所以我喜欢唱歌。
[00:35:34.760] when I'm assured that other people are also really into it. So two other people have the mic, kind of similar to what you're saying, Jisoo, with like everybody really into the song, and we're all singing along. I prefer not to be on the mic, because A, I don't have to give a shit about what I sound like. And then B, usually I'm just like screaming, yelling my head off at the back, and it doesn't matter. I also feel like it's good to have people do that, because I feel like it gives
[00:35:34.760] 当我确信其他人也都很投入的时候，我才会放心。所以另外两个人拿着麦克风，有点像你说的Jisoo那样，大家都很投入，一起合唱。我不太喜欢自己拿着麦克风，因为A，我不用在意自己唱得怎么样。B，我通常就在后面扯着嗓子喊，根本没人在意。我觉得让别人也这么做挺好的，因为我觉得这样能传递一种感觉。
[00:36:02.660] the people who have the mic a little bit more reassurance that they can also just like let loose and sing however they want. But I feel like my favorite part is kind of similar, like being in that kind of environment. I feel like the best ones too, are the ones where I discover new songs that I've forgotten about. Because I feel like nowadays, you know, I obviously have a karaoke playlist,
[00:36:02.660] 那些拿着麦克风的人会更有自信，觉得他们可以放开手脚，想怎么唱就怎么唱。但我感觉我最喜欢的部分其实也差不多，就是身处那种氛围之中。我觉得最棒的卡拉OK体验，也是我能发现一些自己已经忘记的新歌的时候。因为我觉得现在，你知道，我当然也有自己的卡拉OK歌单，
[00:36:29.500] I have go to ones that I always queue up in the beginning or like at the end or whatever. But when other people show up with like really hard hitting bangers that I'm like, holy shit, I cannot believe I forgot this song existed. Or maybe it's like a new song, and I didn't realize how good it is for karaoke. It's like I get to add more to my list. I feel like if a session gives me
[00:36:29.500] 我有一些常唱的歌，总是放在开头或者结尾什么的。但当其他人唱起一些超炸的歌时，我就会想，我的天，我居然忘了这首歌的存在。或者可能是一首新歌，我之前没意识到它这么适合唱卡拉OK。这样我的歌单里就又多了几首歌。我觉得如果一次聚会能让我唱到一些新歌，那就太好了。
[00:36:54.680] like multiple of those songs, then it's a really good productive session for me. Like it, you know, this was a lesson. You know, I was taught in this in this class. You're like reinvesting into your future. Yeah, I was served. Yeah, this is so funny. So karaoke is church to Jisoo and class to Jessica. Okay, Crystal, what is it to you?
[00:36:54.680] 如果我喜欢唱很多首歌，那对我来说就是一次非常高效的练习。就像，你知道，这对我来说是一次学习的机会。你知道，我在这堂课上学到了很多东西。就像是在为你的未来进行再投资。是的，我受益匪浅。是啊，这太有趣了。所以卡拉OK对Jisoo来说是教堂，对Jessica来说是课堂。那么，Crystal，对你来说又是什么呢？
[00:37:21.800] Dude, I actually just really like singing. If I could, I would go solo karaoke. Do it. That was actually a goal of mine in Korea, because you know how they have like the coin karaoke boots? So I like looked all over for it, but it just happened to be the most recent time I was in Korea. I guess I couldn't find one that was like as close to me. So I was like, darn. Next time. So it's like your stage for you.
[00:37:21.800] 兄弟，我其实真的很喜欢唱歌。如果可以的话，我真想一个人去唱卡拉OK。真的。这其实是我在韩国的一个目标，你知道他们那里有那种投币式卡拉OK鞋吗？我到处找，结果正好是我最近一次去韩国。我猜我没找到离我比较近的。所以我就想，哎，下次吧。所以这就像是属于你自己的舞台。
[00:37:46.800] Yeah, I guess it's kind of I don't know if it's necessarily a stage, but it's like a chance to just let loose and like sing your heart out. Do you think it hits for you to like sing while someone else is singing? Because for me, I actually am probably similar to Jessica. Like I don't love being on the mic unless it's a song that I know I can like eat up, you know? Yeah. So I feel like I get similar enjoyment just like screaming on the side.
[00:37:46.800] 是啊，我觉得这有点像……我不知道它算不算一个舞台，但就像是一个可以彻底放松、尽情歌唱的机会。你觉得在别人唱歌的时候跟着唱，对你来说会有什么感觉吗？因为对我来说，我可能和杰西卡很像。除非是那种我知道自己能唱得特别棒的歌，否则我不太喜欢对着麦克风唱歌，你知道吗？嗯。所以我觉得在旁边跟着唱，也能获得类似的乐趣。
[00:38:14.020] I think it does hit, but maybe like having the mic, it hits a little harder. But like, it's almost like karaoke is like people don't have to be there. Other people optional. Wait, question, question. So I feel like if I were to I also haven't karaoke by myself, but I have karaoke with like one other person. And it's basically we're just switching off soloing. So do you feel
[00:38:14.020] 我觉得确实有效果，但可能因为有麦克风，效果会更强一些。不过，卡拉OK好像是一种非得有人在场的感觉。其他人可有可无。等等，有个问题。所以我觉得，如果我一个人唱卡拉OK，我一般会和另一个人一起唱。基本上就是轮流独唱。所以你觉得呢？
[00:38:43.140] like if you were to karaoke by yourself, you would cue different songs? Oh, yeah, absolutely. There's so many songs that I would never cue in karaoke because one, they're just like not karaoke songs, really. And then two, they're like probably no one knows them or like very few people know them. And then I would be like the only one singing it. And then that would be like a vibe killer, right? We want everyone to be like hyped up. Because I mean, it's karaoke is
[00:38:43.140] 比如，如果你一个人去唱卡拉OK，你会点不同的歌吗？哦，当然会。有很多歌我绝对不会点，因为第一，它们根本不适合唱卡拉OK。第二，它们可能没人知道，或者只有极少数人知道。那样的话，就只有我一个人唱了。那岂不是太扫兴了？我们希望每个人都兴致勃勃。因为，我的意思是，卡拉OK嘛……
[00:39:10.020] kind of like a leveled up version of like singing in the shower or like singing in the car. That's like kind of what it is for me, I think. Yeah, I agree. I feel like when I go with just one other person, or if there are sometimes sometimes it actually is kind of a disappointing thing. Because sometimes I'll like have some new song that I really, really love to sing. But then it's not
[00:39:10.020] 感觉就像是浴室唱歌或者车里唱歌的升级版。我觉得对我来说就是这样。嗯，我同意。我觉得如果只有我和另一个人一起唱，或者偶尔有两个人一起唱，其实会有点失望。因为有时候我会有一些特别特别喜欢的新歌想唱，但结果却不是这样。
[00:39:35.380] like the most popular song, or it's like kind of a slower song. And if there's not really like a good moment to bring it out in group karaoke. So then usually I like don't cue it or like, you know, just kind of let it go. So I feel like those would be the songs that I would exclusively do if I went by myself. Yeah, yeah. I feel like going with one or two other people could be really fun too, because then it's almost like you're sharing music with each other. I highly recommend it. It's great.
[00:39:35.380] 比如最流行的歌，或者比较慢的歌。如果在集体卡拉OK里没什么合适的时机唱，那我通常就不会提示，就随性唱。所以我觉得如果我一个人去的话，这些歌我肯定会唱。对对。我觉得和一两个人一起去也很有趣，因为那样就像是在分享音乐一样。我强烈推荐，真的很棒。
[00:40:02.800] I have like a non singing related thing that I would consider one of my favorite parts of karaoke. And I think it comes with the inverse too. Like sometimes this is like my least favorite part of karaoke. I tend to like cuing a bunch of songs and trying to sense out like the group vibe. One of my favorite things is when I cue something and someone's like, Oh my god, who cued this? I love this song. And I'm like, Yes, yes, you do. Because I cued it for you.
[00:40:02.800] 我有一个跟唱歌无关的爱好，可以说是卡拉OK里我最喜欢的部分之一。当然，反过来也成立。有时候，这反而是我最不喜欢的部分。我喜欢点好几首歌，然后感受一下大家的气氛。我最喜欢的就是，当我点了一首歌之后，有人会说：“天哪，谁点的这首歌？我超爱这首歌！”然后我就会说：“对对，你当然喜欢。因为这首歌是我特意为你点的。”
[00:40:29.500] However, recently I had the opposite thing happened to me where I went karaoke with a group of people that I don't know, like super well. And the system at this place was a little bit complicated. It was like, one of those places where you have to download an app and then do this and then do that. And it's like, not like a punch it into the iPad or punch it into the machine. Like it was, you know, required a lot of steps and not everyone wants to download an app. So I kind of took on the position of like,
[00:40:29.500] 然而，最近我遇到了一件截然相反的事情。我和一群不太熟的人去唱卡拉OK，那里的系统有点复杂。你需要下载一个应用程序，然后进行各种操作。不像其他一些卡拉OK那样，直接在iPad或机器上输入卡号就行了。你知道，它需要很多步骤，而且不是每个人都愿意下载应用程序。所以我就扮演了……
[00:40:57.380] Oh, I'll just like cue all the songs like text me or whatever. And then a lot of people didn't even want to look at it. So I was just cuing like my internal like these are the top bangers, right. But because I didn't know these people very well, I think songs that I thought were universal bangers of our generation. Turns out they're not actually universal. And it might be like a regional thing or I don't know, like some sort of demographics issue. But really? Yeah, I cued songs that I was
[00:40:57.380] 哦，我就直接把所有歌都放进去，比如《Text Me》之类的。结果很多人甚至都不想看。所以我当时就心里默默地选了一些热门歌曲，对吧？但因为我对这些人不太了解，我以为那些歌是我们这代人耳熟能详的热门歌曲，结果发现它们其实并不流行。这可能是地域差异，或者我也不知道，可能是人口统计方面的问题。但真的吗？是的，我当时选的歌都是我以为……
[00:41:25.460] like, this is a certified banger. And then only like half of the room knew them. Wait, can you give an example? I think I cued like Fall Out Boy. What? Okay, that's kind of crazy. Yeah. And I was like, I thought we all loved this music. Okay, that one's kind of crazy because Fall Out Boy was definitely on the radio a lot when we were younger. Exactly. It's not like every song that I cued was bad. Like most of them I think were like good. But there was like a couple songs that they were like, Oh, who cued this? Like,
[00:41:25.460] 比如，这首歌绝对是首热门金曲。结果只有一半的人知道他们。等等，你能举个例子吗？我好像放了Fall Out Boy的歌。什么？好吧，这有点不可思议。是啊。我就想，我以为我们都喜欢他们的歌呢。好吧，这确实有点不可思议，因为我们小时候Fall Out Boy的歌经常在电台播放。没错。也不是说我放的每首歌都不好听。我觉得大部分都挺不错的。但也有几首歌，他们会说，哦，谁放的这首歌？
[00:41:54.060] so rude. I don't know the song. Can we cue bangers? And then I was like, what if you told me so? Oh my god. People who don't cue should not have an opinion. That's my take. Honestly, true. Because cuing songs is a lot of brain power. Yeah. Dude, right? It's actually like laborious. Dude, it's so hard that I started a karaoke's notes. Same. To like write down songs. Because it's so easy to get the, you know, the machine or the pad. And then
[00:41:54.060] 太没礼貌了。我不知道这首歌。能不能点些热门歌曲？然后我就想，如果你告诉我呢？我的天哪。不点歌的人没资格发表意见。我就是这么想的。说真的，确实如此。因为点歌很费脑子。是啊。哥们儿，对吧？这其实很费劲。哥们儿，太难了，所以我开始做卡拉OK笔记。我也是。把歌名写下来。因为用机器或者记事本太方便了。然后
[00:42:22.940] you're like, I suddenly don't know what music is. Yeah. What is a song I can cue? I think it was, I don't know, maybe like a learning moment for me. Because with my playlist and what I consider to be like years and years of karaoke experience, I was kind of like, I got this cuing thing to like a decent level. I'm like a B plus at worst, you know? And then after this experience, I was like humbled a little bit. I was like, maybe I don't know what everyone in the room wants.
[00:42:22.940] 你会觉得，我突然不知道音乐是什么了。是啊。我该点什么歌呢？我觉得，嗯，也许对我来说，这算是一个学习的时刻吧。因为凭借我的歌单和我自认为多年的卡拉OK经验，我觉得自己点歌的水平还算不错。至少也得有B+吧，你知道吗？但这次经历之后，我感觉自己有点落伍了。我意识到，也许我根本不知道房间里的每个人想要什么。
[00:42:49.800] Dude, that's tough. You had a difficult crowd to work with because you said they weren't cuing, but then they like had expectations for your cue. Yeah, but it did make me think about like my role in karaoke or like my perceived role, right? And I was like, maybe I should not cue as many songs as I do because I feel like I'm doing the room a favor, but maybe it's in a way like taking away from what other people want to cue and whatnot. Maybe they're just waiting for me to not cue.
[00:42:49.800] 老兄，这可真够棘手的。你说你遇到的这群人很难搞定，因为他们不给你提示，但他们又好像对你提示有所期待。是啊，但这确实让我开始思考我在卡拉OK里的角色，或者说我被别人认为的角色，对吧？我就想，也许我不应该像现在这样提示那么多歌，因为我觉得我是在帮大家，但也许这样反而会妨碍其他人提示。也许他们只是在等我不提示而已。
[00:43:19.100] I wouldn't know, right? Because I'm just guessing. And then the other thing that I realized was, to an extent, I'm kind of an aspirational cueer. And I'm actually like this when I shop too. I'm an aspirational shopper. Like I shop for what I want myself to be able to like wear. But what you can actually wear and pull off in real life and in your everyday events is not going to be the same thing as what you like seeing on a celebrity or something. In the same way, like karaoke, that story I shared
[00:43:19.100] 我也不知道，对吧？因为我只是在猜。然后我意识到，在某种程度上，我有点像个“理想型引领者”。我购物的时候也是这样。我是个“理想型购物者”。我买衣服就是为了让自己能穿。但你在现实生活中、日常场合真正能穿的衣服，和你在明星身上看到的肯定不一样。就像我之前分享的那个卡拉OK故事一样。
[00:43:47.200] about like me stumbling over some rap song in Korea. Like I do that sometimes. I'll like put on a song because I'm like, I love this song. I cannot sing it, but I want someone in the room to sing it. And I've done that before where I'll cue a song and I'll hand the mic to one specific person and be like, can you do this? After my karaoke shenanigans, I reflected on myself and I'm, you know, I'm
[00:43:47.200] 就像我在韩国偶然听到一首说唱歌曲一样。我有时候会这样。我会放一首歌，因为我喜欢这首歌。我不会唱，但我想让房间里的某个人唱。我以前也这么做过，我会放一首歌，然后把麦克风递给某个人，问他：“你能唱一下吗？” 在我搞砸了卡拉OK之后，我反思了一下自己，然后，你知道，我
[00:44:09.500] working on it. You're like, I cued this for you to sing to me. It's like a delivery. I mean, I feel like that's still totally fair. If, you know, if you have a song you like and you want to cue it and who cares if you sing, you know, not the best. I think that's one of the big things about karaoke. You're not like the world's best singer, but everyone's still gonna sing along and have fun. That's true. It's just hard to suss out group vibes. And I think the big learning too is like
[00:44:09.500] 正在努力呢。你会想，我特意为你准备了这首歌，让你唱给我听。这就像一种表演。我的意思是，我觉得这完全公平。你知道，如果你有一首喜欢的歌，想把它作为提示，谁会在意你唱得好不好呢？我觉得这是卡拉OK的魅力之一。你不是世界上最好的歌手，但大家还是会一起唱，玩得很开心。确实如此。只是很难把握大家的氛围。而且我觉得，卡拉OK最大的收获之一就是……
[00:44:39.320] with a new group, you just don't know. That's true. Like these aren't the best friends that you go to karaoke with once a month, allegedly once a quarter per song and share the same number of songs on your like karaoke playlist, right? I don't know what these people like. Actually, that's true. Maybe you need to karaoke with trusted friends. Suddenly it seems so dangerous. Like you need, you know, your friends who you know are just there to have a good time with you and like they're not there to
[00:44:39.320] 跟一群新朋友一起唱，你真的不知道会发生什么。没错。这些人不是那种你每个月都一起去唱K的死党，据说每季度都唱一首歌，而且你们的K歌单里歌单上的歌都一样多，对吧？我不知道这些人喜欢什么。确实如此。也许你需要和信任的朋友一起唱K。突然间，这似乎变得很危险。你需要的是那种你知道的、只想和你一起开心的朋友，而不是那种……
[00:45:09.320] judge you or anything. So maybe besides the singing part, that's like another part I like that we're just all there to like have fun. Yeah. Well, I feel like I talked a little bit about my personal karaoke sins, but do you guys have any things that come to mind in terms of like karaoke no-nos? It doesn't have to be about yourself, but just in general. Well, we talked about one. But it's a work in progress.
[00:45:09.320] 不会评判你什么的。所以除了唱歌之外，我喜欢的一点就是我们大家聚在一起就是为了开心。嗯。我觉得我刚才稍微说了说我自己的卡拉OK“罪过”，你们有没有什么卡拉OK禁忌之类的？不一定非得是关于自己的，一般来说就行。嗯，我们之前聊过一个。不过这方面还在完善中。
[00:45:38.780] Okay, I have one. I feel like for me, maybe sometimes the temptation to cue foreign language songs, but not in the right environment. So it's kind of like, you know, depending on the crowd, depending on the time, how far into the karaoke session you are. And also if there's like other people who know the song. So I feel like sometimes I'll sing songs and like I'll sing like Chinese
[00:45:38.780] 好吧，我有个想法。我觉得有时候我会忍不住想唱外语歌，但场合不太合适。所以，你知道，这取决于现场的气氛，取决于时间，取决于卡拉OK进行到什么程度。还有就是，有没有其他人会唱这首歌。所以我觉得有时候我会唱一些歌，比如唱中文歌。
[00:46:08.160] songs. I'll attempt to sing Korean songs. I like it better when Jisoo's there. So then, you know, Korean songs are like the ones where I cue and I hand it to Jisoo and I'm like, can you sing this for me? We're like, we only know the chorus, the English parts in the chorus. Jisoo will rap it and I'll like shout the last like few words. Cause you're like, and then I know like the last few. You're like, baby, my lady. That's me in foreign language songs.
[00:46:08.160] 我会尝试唱韩语歌。有Jisoo在的时候我更喜欢。你知道，唱韩语歌的时候，我先给Jisoo提示，然后把歌词递给她，问她：“你能唱给我听吗？”我们只会唱副歌，也就是副歌里的英文部分。Jisoo会唱rap，然后我会喊出最后几个字。因为你知道，然后我就知道最后几个字。你会说：“宝贝，我的女神。”这就是我唱外语歌的样子。
[00:46:37.360] Kind of what you said, like there's listening songs and then there's like karaoke, like songs that you actually know how to sing. So sometimes I have to like practice a little at home, especially if it's like a new song that I'm really determined to sing. Like, okay, I have to like practice this. So like last week before my karaoke, I was practicing Extra L by Jenny featuring Dochi. But they didn't have it. They did not. So I didn't get to. So yeah,
[00:46:37.360] 就像你说的，有些歌是用来听的，有些歌是用来唱的，比如卡拉OK，就是唱那些你真正会唱的歌。所以有时候我得在家练练，特别是如果是一首我特别想唱的新歌。就像，好吧，我得练练这首歌。比如上周去卡拉OK之前，我就在练Jenny和Dochi合作的《Extra L》。但是他们那里没有这首歌。真的没有。所以我没唱成。所以，嗯。
[00:47:05.580] next time you put in all that. I know. Now I know Dochi's verse really well. So next time you'll have to hear me sing it. So yeah, I feel like there is a time and place for foreign language songs. Sometimes not every karaoke session, there is an opportunity for foreign language songs to like come out or like it's not it's like just not the right crowd, especially if it's only me, or like me and one other person in a larger group who would actually care about these songs. So
[00:47:05.580] 下次你把那些都放进去。我知道。我现在对Dochi的歌词很熟悉了。所以下次你得听我唱。所以，我觉得唱外语歌还是要看场合的。有时候不是每次卡拉OK都适合唱外语歌，或者说，可能只是因为听众不对，尤其是只有我一个人，或者在一个比较大的朋友圈里只有我和另一个人，而他们可能根本不在乎这些歌。
[00:47:33.620] sometimes I just have to like learn to let it go next time, you know? Yeah, I'm lucky realizing that a lot of karaoke etiquette is like learning to let things go. Whether it's the mic, the aspirational cueing, the foreign language songs, but we're working on it. I feel like we are reformed. Yeah. There's another thing that I had to let go actually. Wait, the story of Loki cracks me up. And I've never spoken like I've never told this story to anyone before. But I never forgot this after it
[00:47:33.620] 有时候我得学会下次放下，你知道吗？是啊，我很幸运地意识到，很多卡拉OK礼仪其实就是学会放下。不管是麦克风、提示、还是外语歌，我们都在努力改进。我觉得我们已经改过自新了。是啊。其实还有一件事我必须放下。等等，洛基的故事真是让我笑死了。我以前从来没跟任何人讲过这个故事。但之后我一直都记得这件事。
[00:48:03.540] happened. There was a time in college where we were going karaoke all the time. It felt like we were going like every week or something. I feel like the three of us go a lot in general. But then we had just met like a new friend group at the time. So me and Jessica were going with like a couple people that we didn't really know as well. We were like singing at karaoke once. I was really feeling myself. There's like a point in karaoke sometimes where I just like really feel like I'm a great
[00:48:03.540] 确实发生过。大学的时候，我们经常去唱卡拉OK。感觉好像每周都去。我们三个平时去得挺频繁的。但那时候我们刚认识了一群新朋友。所以我和杰西卡就和几个不太熟的人一起去唱卡拉OK。有一次，我们一起去唱卡拉OK，我感觉自己特别棒。有时候唱卡拉OK的时候，我会觉得自己特别厉害。
[00:48:31.240] singer. And Jessica and I were singing the song together. And I started harmonizing like every note. Oh my God. Like not even just like a little bit. Like I was harmonizing every note, like verse, bridge, chorus, everything. I don't remember this. Then we were singing it. And then I think I said something like, damn, it's kind of hard to harmonize to Jessica because I was like, it's hard to harmonize the verse obviously. Or like just like random bits. And then Jessica turned to me
[00:48:31.240] 歌手。然后我和杰西卡一起唱这首歌。我开始跟她和声，几乎每个音符都跟着唱。我的天哪。不是一点点，而是每个音符都跟着唱，主歌、桥段、副歌，所有的一切。我不记得这件事了。然后我们继续唱。然后我想我说了句什么，比如，哎，跟杰西卡和声有点难，因为我觉得，主歌部分显然很难和声。或者说，一些零碎的部分。然后杰西卡转过头来看着我。
[00:48:59.760] and was like, then maybe you should stop. Wait, what? You're lying. I did not say that. I'm literally not joking. I'm dying. After he said that, I stopped. And then I was like, I thought I was being like a, like a helper, you know, like I thought I was being like your little sous chef. And then I realized I was just not being a helper and I was just like shitting on the song. So then after that, I like never harmonized. Wait, no, I literally don't remember that. Please
[00:48:59.760] 然后我就说，那你也许应该停下来。等等，什么？你在撒谎。我没说过那样的话。我真的没开玩笑。我快笑死了。他说完那句话之后，我就停了下来。然后我就想，我当时觉得自己像个……像个帮手，你知道吗，就像你的小副厨一样。然后我意识到我根本不是在帮忙，我只是在糟蹋这首歌。所以从那以后，我就再也没唱过和声了。等等，不，我真的不记得了。拜托
[00:49:27.060] harmonize as much as you want. Oh my God. Holy shit. I don't remember this at all. I'm so sorry. I think about this sometimes and I laugh. No, no, no. It's honestly, you were so right. Cause this would have been my other karaoke no, no to this day. Oh my God. Oh my God. Please, please harmonize if you want. Like it literally doesn't matter.
[00:49:27.060] 想怎么和声都行。我的天哪。我的老天爷。我完全不记得这首歌了。真抱歉。我有时候想起这首歌都会笑。不不不。说真的，你说得太对了。因为这首歌本来会是我至今为止最不想唱的卡拉OK之一。我的天哪。我的天哪。想和声就和声吧。真的，和声好不好根本无所谓。
[00:49:56.150] Wait, I want, I need to hear you harmonize next time. It was bad. I can assure you it was bad. Verses would be hard, but the choruses, I feel like you could slay them. Yeah. I think the problem was I was just doing the whole song. You're literally lying. I did not say
[00:49:56.150] 等等，我想，我需要下次听你唱和声。唱得太糟糕了。我可以向你保证，真的糟透了。主歌部分可能很难，但我觉得你唱副歌肯定能完美驾驭。是啊。我觉得问题在于我当时一口气唱完了整首歌。你简直在撒谎。我没说过
[00:50:17.550] that. It's okay. Jisoo. Jessica has said right here on record, please harmonize. Please do it. Oh, I'll come with the H's. I'll terrorize our karaoke sessions. Dude. That's why we have two mics. One for you to harmonize.
[00:50:17.550] 没关系。智秀。杰西卡之前已经公开说过，请你和声。拜托了。哦，我会唱“H”的。我会把我们的卡拉OK搞得乌烟瘴气。哥们儿。所以我们才准备了两个麦克风。一个给你唱和声。
[00:50:44.630] Yeah. I'll bring it back. I'll bring it back. You can also turn on the, I guess a separate question is do you guys like it when the backtrack is on or not with the actual singer singing the songs? That's a good question. If it's a hard song, Loki having backtrack is like pretty helpful for those like notes that no one's hitting. You're like, all right, the backtrack can like do the work here. Yeah. You could do the mic fade away. But I feel like when it's a song that like
[00:50:44.630] 好的，我会把它恢复。我会恢复的。你也可以打开……我想问一下，你们喜欢在歌手演唱时开启伴奏还是关闭伴奏？问得好。如果是比较难的歌，Loki 的伴奏对于那些没人唱到的音符来说非常有用。你会觉得，好吧，伴奏可以帮上忙。是的。你可以让麦克风淡出。但我觉得，当歌曲……
[00:51:10.970] everyone knows not having the backtrack is a little better because then everyone doesn't have to feel pressure necessarily to like follow some backtrack. They can just like do whatever. It's okay if like we're a little off or whatever. Yeah. I think I prefer the backtrack on. My whole thing is this. In every group that goes karaoke, there's strong singers and then there's like people who are down to sing, but singing is not like their thing. And I think when the backtrack is on is super helpful
[00:51:10.970] 大家都知道不放伴奏更好，因为这样大家就不用非得跟着伴奏唱，可以自由发挥。就算唱得有点跑调也没关系。嗯，我觉得还是放伴奏比较好。我的想法是这样的：每个一起去唱卡拉OK的人里，都有唱功好的，也有那种想唱但唱歌不是他们强项的人。我觉得放伴奏真的很有帮助。
[00:51:37.750] for people like that. And the other thing is every karaoke I've been to, one mic is always louder than the other. And I feel like when there's a backtrack on, it kind of like helps wash that away. But if it's not on, the loud person sounds really fucking loud. So yeah, I think the backtrack is a little better for me. Do you turn it on or off based on the song? I feel like usually it's like it's already on either at the beginning or it's like already off at the beginning. And then it's
[00:51:37.750] 对那种人来说是这样。还有一点就是，我去过的所有卡拉OK，总有一个麦克风的声音比另一个大。我觉得如果开了伴奏，就能稍微掩盖这个问题。但如果不开伴奏，声音大的人听起来就特别吵。所以，我觉得伴奏对我来说好一些。你是根据歌曲来决定是否开启伴奏吗？我觉得通常情况下，伴奏要么一开始就开了，要么一开始就关了。然后……
[00:52:05.530] just like that the whole time. I've never actively been like, I want this on or off for certain songs. I think similar, usually whatever it's set to in the beginning, we just leave it at that. But I think if we're queuing up on YouTube, then you can totally just queue up the song itself. If it's like, I want to have the backtrack or something like that. Yeah. I lowkey love karaoke places that have that YouTube setup. It's like kind of Jane to a certain extent. But also you can queue random ass
[00:52:05.530] 一直都是这样。我从来没特意想过要为某些歌开启或关闭这个功能。我觉得差不多，通常情况下，不管一开始设置成什么样，我们都保持原样。但我觉得如果是在 YouTube 上点歌，那就完全可以自己把歌加进去。比如，我想听伴奏之类的。是的。我其实挺喜欢那种有 YouTube 功能的卡拉 OK 店。某种程度上有点像 Jane 的风格。而且你也可以随意添加一些歌。
[00:52:34.350] songs that haven't flown through like the real karaoke system yet. So everything is like fresh and new. Yeah, that's true. Oh my god, another separate question. Do you guys prefer when they actually show like the real music video for the song? Like fancier places usually will have the real music video or, you know, like the semi jank ones where it's like some random old 80s Japanese person
[00:52:34.350] 有些歌还没在真正的卡拉OK系统里播放过。所以一切都很新鲜。是啊，没错。哦，天哪，还有一个问题。你们更喜欢播放歌曲的原版MV吗？像比较高档的地方通常会放原版MV，还是那种比较简陋的地方，放一些80年代日本老头的MV？
[00:53:02.950] on like the beach and they're like walking and it's like fading out. I don't even know where those videos come from. But which one do you prefer? Wait, dude, I'm a music video enjoyer. I used to watch music videos on MTV. Oh, I always love it when it's the OG music video. I feel like that's so rare. Like I don't remember the last time I I've seen the real music video on screen. But I'm very used to like, just the Korean style places and they play like the same five
[00:53:02.950] 就像在海滩上，他们走来走去，然后画面就渐渐淡出。我甚至不知道这些视频是从哪儿来的。不过你更喜欢哪个？等等，哥们，我可是个音乐录影带爱好者。我以前经常在MTV上看音乐录影带。哦，我总是喜欢看原版MV。我觉得这种MV太难得了。我都记不清上次在电视上看到真正的MV是什么时候了。但我很习惯那种韩式风格的MV，而且他们总是放那五首歌。
[00:53:32.410] videos over and over. So I don't really have a preference either way. Do you have a preference? I think I actually prefer the not music video. Oh, I feel like it's always cool when the music I feel like it's more rare for me to go to a place where they actually play the music videos. Yeah. But I feel like I prefer the other one because sometimes the real music video will have some type of story, you know, or it's like an extended like artsy video. And I'm just like, I'm just trying to sing,
[00:53:32.410] 视频一遍又一遍地看。所以我其实没有特别的偏好。你有偏好吗？我觉得我其实更喜欢没有MV的。哦，我觉得音乐本身很酷，但我很少有机会去那种会播放MV的地方。是啊。但我感觉我更喜欢另一种，因为有时候真正的MV会有一些故事情节，你知道，或者像那种加长版的艺术视频。而我呢，我只是想唱歌而已。
[00:54:02.070] you know, or like in the middle, in the middle of the music video, it'll like cut out the song, you know, like be some mini movie and then like go back to the song. And I feel like it like kind of ruins the vibes a little bit. Not that there's a ton of music videos like that. But I feel like the risk is there. Wait, actually, you're so right. I think that happens more with modern songs because they do that for like copyright or like to avoid people ripping it off YouTube or something.
[00:54:02.070] 你知道，就像在音乐录影带中间，歌曲突然中断，变成一段小电影，然后再切回歌曲。我觉得这样有点破坏气氛。当然，这样的音乐录影带并不多见，但我觉得这种做法是有风险的。等等，你说的太对了。我觉得现在的歌曲更容易出现这种情况，因为他们这样做是为了版权，或者防止有人从YouTube之类的网站上盗版。
[00:54:28.750] But you're so right. Actually, that does totally kill the vibe. There's like the random mini movie in the middle. When you're singing all too well, Taylor's version, with like literally a movie. Yeah. But I feel like if the music video is not interrupting the music, it's sometimes fun. You're watching the movie. Or like a lot of times I feel like I have never seen the music video before. So I'm like, whoa, like I've never actually seen the music video
[00:54:28.750] 但你说得太对了。确实，那样完全破坏了气氛。就像中间突然冒出来个小短片。泰勒的版本唱得特别好，结果突然就插播了个电影。是啊。不过我觉得，如果MV不打断音乐，有时候还挺有意思的。就像在看电影一样。或者很多时候，我感觉自己好像从来没看过这个MV。所以我就想，哇，我好像真的从来没看过这个MV。
[00:54:57.170] for this. So it's kind of cool to see it. I guess it's like on the border of cool and like distracting. And you just like don't know which side it'll fall on. Yeah. True. Dang, does this mean you have to learn music videos too? Like, oh, this is the list of not just karaoke songs, but like karaoke, okayed karaoke music videos. Yeah. I will say all of this karaoke talk makes me really fiend for karaoke now. I'm like, dude,
[00:54:57.170] 就是因为这个。所以看到这个还挺酷的。我觉得它介于酷和分散注意力之间。你根本不知道它会归到哪一边。是啊。没错。天哪，这岂不是说你还得学音乐视频？比如，哦，这不只是卡拉OK歌曲列表，还有卡拉OK专用的、经过审核的卡拉OK音乐视频。是啊。我得说，所有这些关于卡拉OK的话题现在真的让我很想唱卡拉OK了。我就想，老兄，
[00:55:24.170] should we go to karaoke this weekend? I know. Literally. I just had my fix. So, but that's why I was so ready for this episode. I was like, okay, I'm like, I'm fresh off the karaoke experience. Well, our listeners will have to stay tuned for a part two if we ever do go and do that karaoke session. We'll be sure to come back with more pro tips, but thank you, Jessica, for coming on and
[00:55:24.170] 我们这周末要不要去唱卡拉OK？我知道，真的。我刚唱完，正想念呢。所以，我才这么期待这期节目。我当时就想，好吧，我刚体验完卡拉OK，感觉真棒！如果我们真的去了卡拉OK，听众朋友们就得继续关注第二部分了。我们一定会回来分享更多实用技巧，谢谢杰西卡来做客！
