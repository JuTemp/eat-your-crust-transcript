[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Daniel. Welcome, Daniel. Last time we had you on was back in episode 120, Gym Rats and Gym Noobs, where we talked about all things gyming. Sad to say that I personally have not
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Daniel。欢迎Daniel。上次我们请你来是在第120期节目“健身达人和健身菜鸟”中，我们聊了关于健身的一切。遗憾的是，我个人还没有……
[00:00:28.880] furthered my gym journey. That's quite unfortunate. But I am more active than when we recorded that episode. Ah, it's nice. So before we get to the topic at hand, I have a word to share this week, and my
[00:00:28.880] 这进一步推动了我的健身之旅。真是有点可惜。不过，我现在比录制那期节目时活跃多了。啊，真好。所以，在我们进入正题之前，我这周想分享一些事情，还有我的
[00:00:44.160] word is tweaking. I actually don't have like a full proper definition for tweaking, but essentially it's someone is acting out maybe or like not calm. They're like freaking out is the basic explanation that I can think of. So I've seen it used like, oh, this person's tweaking, don't
[00:00:44.160] 这个词是“tweaking”。我其实没有“tweaking”的完整定义，但基本上就是某人行为异常，或者情绪不稳定。我能想到的最基本的解释就是他们情绪失控。所以我见过有人这样用：“哦，这个人情绪失控了，别……”
[00:01:05.760] listen to them, or like someone get them help or whatever. So that's kind of the usage that I've seen tweaking. But I've seen it like all over TikTok. And I feel like Gen Z loves to use this word.
[00:01:05.760] 听听他们的想法，或者找个人帮帮他们什么的。这就是我看到的一些用法变化。我在TikTok上到处都能看到这个词。我觉得Z世代很喜欢用这个词。
[00:01:16.320] Huh, I feel like I've only ever seen it in like the drug context, which is probably the more like literal usage of the word. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. But I know like on Reddit, especially
[00:01:16.320] 嗯，我感觉我只在毒品相关的语境里见过这个词，这大概才是它最字面的用法。对，我也是这么想的。但我知道在Reddit上，尤其是在……
[00:01:26.960] there's like a subreddit called r slash took too much where it has videos of people who are like really, really hopped up on drugs. And all the comments are always like, oh, like he's tweaking
[00:01:26.960] 有个叫 r/Take Too Much 的子版块，里面全是嗑药嗑到神志不清的人的视频。评论里总是说，“哦，他好像嗑药嗑嗨了。”
[00:01:36.160] off of whatever. That's what I thought of to like actual drug tweakers. Okay, so I just found it on know your meme, but the entry is not he tweaking. And it's from Lil Nas X. Oh, so there was a post
[00:01:36.160] 不管是什么。我当时就想到了那些真正的瘾君子。好吧，我刚在Know Your Meme上找到的，但那个条目不是关于“tweaking”（他嗑药）的。而且它来自Lil Nas X。哦，原来有个帖子
[00:01:51.920] on Instagram that said Tony Hawk is selling skateboards infused with his blood for $500 each. And then Lil Nas X commented on that post. He was like, nah, he tweaking. So I guess in this
[00:01:51.920] Instagram 上有人说托尼·霍克正在出售注入他血液的滑板，每块售价 500 美元。然后 Lil Nas X 在那条帖子下评论说，不，他肯定是在胡说八道。所以我觉得这事儿……
[00:02:05.600] context, tweaking is basically mean like, what is this crazy behavior? So I guess it can tie back to like drugs. It's like, dude, is this guy on something like what is this? Yeah, blood infused
[00:02:05.600] 上下文里，“微调”基本上就是指，这是什么疯狂的行为？所以我觉得这可能跟毒品有关。就好像，老兄，这家伙是不是嗑药了？这是什么玩意儿？没错，就是血液灌注。
[00:02:16.720] skateboards is kind of wild. Damn, actually, nah, he tweaking is pretty iconic. Like I understand why it's a catchphrase now. Yeah, so I see a lot of Oh, this dude's tweaking or like, what is this?
[00:02:16.720] 滑板这玩意儿真够疯狂的。哎，说真的，他玩滑板的那个动作简直太经典了。我现在终于明白为什么这成了流行语了。是啊，我经常看到有人说“哦，这家伙在玩滑板”或者“这是什么？”
[00:02:29.760] Like, yeah, basically calling out kind of outrageous behavior. Do you feel like you see it anywhere else other than I guess drug related stuff? I guess now that we have talked about this a little bit,
[00:02:29.760] 嗯，基本上就是谴责这种过分的行为。除了毒品相关的事情之外，你觉得在其他方面也能看到类似的行为吗？既然我们已经稍微聊了一下这个话题，我想……
[00:02:40.480] I do think I see people use tweaking in like a bigger context. So like if there's some weird video or something, where someone has like a bad take, I think I have seen comments of like, oh,
[00:02:40.480] 我确实看到人们在更广泛的语境中使用“微调”这个词。比如，如果出现一些奇怪的视频，或者有人拍得很糟糕，我好像看到过这样的评论：哦，
[00:02:51.040] this guy's tweaking or whatever. I just never made the connection. Like I think I kind of subconsciously thought they were always talking about drugs. Yeah, it feels synonymous with like tripping, I guess. Like no, it's guys tripping or like he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:02:51.040] 这家伙是不是嗑药了？我之前一直没把这事儿联系起来。感觉我潜意识里总觉得他们说的都是毒品。对，感觉跟“嗑药”差不多。不，应该是有人嗑药了，或者他根本不知道自己在说什么。
[00:03:04.480] Yeah, it says nice tweaking. Well, I guess this is going to be a new Gen Z word added to my personal arsenal. But tweaking aside, let's go into the topic we have at hand today, which is Valentine's
[00:03:04.480] 是啊，上面写着“不错的调整”。好吧，看来我要把这个新词添加到我的Z世代词汇库里了。不过，先不说调整的事，我们还是回到今天的主题——情人节吧。
[00:03:19.280] Day. So Valentine's Day is coming up. And actually, this episode is a week before Valentine's Day. But we thought that we would push it out a little bit early, give everyone some time to think about
[00:03:19.280] 情人节快到了。实际上，这集节目是在情人节前一周播出的。但我们想提前一点播出，给大家一些时间考虑一下。
[00:03:30.160] the holiday before the actual holiday comes upon us. I was surprised when we looked at our past catalog of episodes and we're like, we've never talked about Valentine's Day before. So we thought it would be fun to bring our good friend Daniel on to talk about Valentine's Day
[00:03:30.160] 情人节前的那个节日。我们回顾之前的节目时很惊讶，竟然从来没聊过情人节。所以我们觉得邀请好朋友丹尼尔来聊聊情人节会很有趣。
[00:03:44.960] and how we view it and how it's played a role in our lives through our different ages and eras. So I guess like the first thing that comes to mind for Valentine's Day is what did you do in your
[00:03:44.960] 以及我们如何看待它，它在我们不同年龄和时代中扮演着怎样的角色。所以我想，情人节首先让我想到的就是：你去年情人节做了什么？
[00:03:58.560] childhood for Valentine's Day? Did you bring Valentine's to school and like candy and celebrate it in the classroom? Or was it kind of not a big deal? Yeah, for me personally, I don't think it
[00:03:58.560] 你小时候是怎么过情人节的？你会带情人节卡片去学校，吃糖果，在教室里庆祝吗？还是说情人节对你来说并不重要？嗯，就我个人而言，我觉得情人节没什么大不了的。
[00:04:10.320] was a big part of my life growing up as a kid. I don't remember doing too many things for Valentine's Day. I never brought candy to like school, or even now to work. I feel like it's
[00:04:10.320] 情人节是我童年生活中很重要的一部分。我不记得自己过过多少情人节。我从来不带糖果去学校，甚至现在上班也不会带。我觉得它……
[00:04:21.360] definitely more of a personal holiday to me where you would celebrate it with like your significant other nothing like in public, I guess like it's not really like a community holiday. Yeah.
[00:04:21.360] 对我来说，这绝对更像是一个私人节日，你会和你的另一半一起庆祝，而不是像其他节日那样在公共场合庆祝，我觉得它不太像是一个公共节日。是的。
[00:04:32.320] I also didn't bring Valentine's candy to school. And I feel like a big part of that is when you're seven years old, you're not the one going to Safeway and picking up like a bag of candy, right?
[00:04:32.320] 我也没有带情人节糖果去学校。我觉得很大一部分原因是，当你只有七岁的时候，你不会去Safeway超市买一大袋糖果，对吧？
[00:04:42.000] I feel like it's always the parents who do it. And I don't think in Korea, they have this sort of culture. So my mom didn't even think to kind of include it in her shopping list or whatnot. But I
[00:04:42.000] 我觉得总是父母做这件事。而且我觉得韩国没有这种文化。所以我妈妈甚至都没想过要把它加到购物清单里之类的。但是
[00:04:53.200] do distinctly remember, there would be kids in the class that would bring candy to school. And it would be really cute because they would write like, oh, two and then write each person's
[00:04:53.200] 我清楚地记得，班里有些孩子会带糖果来学校。那真的很可爱，因为他们会写上“哦，两个”，然后写下每个人的糖果数量。
[00:05:01.920] name and then from and then their own name. And I would always be like, wow, this person is so caring or like, I don't know. I feel like it did change my perspective on them. Or at least their
[00:05:01.920] 先是名字，然后是“来自”，最后是他们自己的名字。我总是会想，哇，这个人真贴心，或者，我也不知道该怎么形容。我觉得这确实改变了我对他们的看法。或者至少改变了我对他们的看法。
[00:05:12.880] mom, I guess. Actually, now that you mention it, there might have been like in elementary school, like the teachers would have you make cards and like trade with people. I think there'd be those
[00:05:12.880] 我想应该是妈妈吧。其实，你这么一说，好像小学的时候老师会让我们做卡片，然后跟别人交换。我觉得应该有那种卡片。
[00:05:23.760] like little heart shaped candies. I don't know they would say like, be mine or something. Yeah. Like conversation hearts. Yeah, yeah. Like those. So I do remember doing that. But I never like personally went and got these. I think it was just like a school or classroom thing.
[00:05:23.760] 就像那种心形的小糖果。我不知道上面会不会写着“做我的情人”之类的。对，就像那种心形糖果。对，对，就是那种。所以我记得我吃过。但我从来没亲自去买过。我觉得那只是学校或者教室里的一种活动。
[00:05:38.560] Yeah, I think in elementary school, it was kind of a bigger deal since we had a homeroom. So we had a decent amount of people bring valentines or candy to share with the class. But yeah,
[00:05:38.560] 是的，我觉得在小学的时候，这件事更受重视，因为我们有班主任。所以会有不少人带情人节礼物或糖果来和全班分享。嗯，
[00:05:51.680] as you said, it's like, you know, thanks to their parents. But I think as we got older, so you know, once we were getting closer to the end of elementary school, like fourth, fifth, sixth grade,
[00:05:51.680] 正如你所说，这要感谢他们的父母。但我觉得随着我们年龄的增长，你知道，当我们快要小学毕业的时候，比如四年级、五年级、六年级的时候，
[00:06:03.440] then the candy is like tapering off. And by junior high, high school, I think it was very rare to hand out valentines. But I think that I did still see it very occasionally, someone would
[00:06:03.440] 然后糖果就逐渐减少了。到了初中、高中，我觉得送情人节卡片已经非常罕见了。但我偶尔还是能看到有人送。
[00:06:16.640] maybe just get some candy and give it to their close friends. Yeah, I find the whole like elementary school valentine's culture very fascinating. Because a lot of it, I think does show each
[00:06:16.640] 或许可以买些糖果送给他们的好朋友。是啊，我觉得小学情人节文化特别有意思。因为我觉得它确实展现了每个人的性格特点。
[00:06:29.040] person's personality a little bit like I remember the guys would always get cars themed or like Spider Man themed valentines. And then the girls would get like Powerpuff Girls or like something more feminine. And I remember even the types of candy that were included in the valentine very
[00:06:29.040] 我记得男生收到的情人节礼物总是汽车主题或者蜘蛛侠主题的，而女生收到的则是飞天小女警之类的，或者更女性化的东西。我甚至还记得情人节礼物里装的糖果种类。
[00:06:44.560] too. So I remember some of them, it was literally just a card and I'd be like, boo. And then some of them would be like a Tootsie Roll or like a low tier candy. And I would also be like,
[00:06:44.560] 我也记得有些礼物，真的就只是一张卡片，我就会想，真扫兴。还有一些礼物是像Tootsie Roll巧克力棒之类的，或者一些很普通的糖果。我也会想，
[00:06:53.520] Hmm, okay. And then the really good ones were like nerds or like little Sour Patch or something. And I was like, these are the winners. These are like the A grade S tier valentines. I might have been the guy giving the cards.
[00:06:53.520] 嗯，好吧。然后那些真正好的卡片就像书呆子或者小酸味软糖之类的。我就想，这些才是赢家。这些是顶级的S级情人节卡片。我可能就是送卡片的那个人。
[00:07:08.400] Actually, I think I was the same. I think I did cards only. It's okay. If it makes you feel better. I did not give anything out. So I was just judging by myself.
[00:07:08.400] 其实，我觉得我也是一样。我只做了卡片。没关系。如果这样能让你感觉好些的话。我什么都没送。所以我只是在自我评价。
[00:07:20.320] But I'm trying to think about how the valentine's culture worked in high school. Because like you said, Crystal, I don't think people really passed out valentines. But our school did serenades. So you could actually pay like $15 or something to our schools choirs. And then they would kind of
[00:07:20.320] 但我一直在想高中时的情人节文化是怎么回事。因为就像你说的，克丽丝塔尔，我觉得那时候人们并不怎么会发情人节卡片。不过我们学校会举办小夜曲表演。所以你可以花15美元左右请学校合唱团来表演。然后他们就会……
[00:07:38.800] assemble little groups and go around during classrooms burst through the doors on Valentine's Day, put the girl or the guy on a chair and surround them and do a dance and song. And I
[00:07:38.800] 把学生们分成小组，在情人节那天冲进教室，把男生或女生拉到椅子上，围着他们唱歌跳舞。
[00:07:48.320] remember that was always very much like what Valentine's Day was. I totally forgot about that. But yes, I was actually in choir doing that. Was it popular? Yeah, we would spend like the entire day doing it. And like people would get them for teachers
[00:07:48.320] 记得那一直很像情人节。我完全忘了这回事了。不过，我当时确实在合唱团里唱过。很流行吗？是啊，我们几乎一整天都在唱。而且有人还会把唱诗班的歌送给老师。
[00:08:05.200] and stuff too. So I remember, like they would split it into like boys groups serenading girls. I remember doing one for like our principal actually. Oh my god. Which is really random. We're doing all these like weird, weird choreographed dances where like it's like
[00:08:05.200] 还有其他一些事。我记得，他们会把队伍分成几个小组，男生们轮流给女生唱歌。我记得我还给校长表演过一次。我的天哪。这真的太奇怪了。我们当时跳了很多很奇怪的、编排好的舞蹈，就像……
[00:08:20.400] slightly suggestive, which is weird when it's the principal. Wait, so for these choir serenades, would they get to choose the song that you would sing for the person? Or did you just choose? Oh no, we chose the song and then we would do the
[00:08:20.400] 有点暗示性，校长这么说就有点奇怪了。等等，所以这些合唱小夜曲，是让他们选歌，还是你们自己选的？哦不，歌是我们选的，然后我们再唱……
[00:08:36.480] choreograph and then we would do the same one for everyone. Oh, okay. So a lot easier. Yeah, makes sense. No special requests. Imagine you guys like trying to practice. You're like grinding the songs. You're like, holy shit, we need to learn these hundred songs by like next week.
[00:08:36.480] 编排好舞蹈，然后我们每个人都跳同样的舞。哦，好的。这样容易多了。嗯，有道理。没有特殊要求。想象一下你们练习的样子。你们就像在苦练歌曲。你们会想，我的天哪，我们下周之前得学会这上百首歌。
[00:08:55.840] I think my school also did something similar. We had various clubs do different Valentine grams essentially. So acapella group did singing. And then I think there were various service clubs that would do like, I don't know, like an origami rose or like paper cranes, something simple like
[00:08:55.840] 我觉得我们学校也搞过类似的活动。各个社团都做了不同的情人节贺卡。比如无伴奏合唱团唱歌。然后好像还有一些服务社团会做一些，比如折纸玫瑰或者纸鹤之类的，一些简单的东西。
[00:09:15.280] that, which I thought was like kind of nice because sometimes you would go to your classroom and then like see the gram or whatever on your desk and be like, oh, like that's, that's nice.
[00:09:15.280] 我觉得这挺好的，因为有时候你走进教室，看到桌子上的 gram 之类的东西，就会想，哦，这挺好的。
[00:09:23.920] And there were occasional mysterious ones like, oh, from your secret admirer. And then people be like, Oh, I wonder who that is. And then they forget the next day. It's kind of interesting.
[00:09:23.920] 偶尔还会收到一些神秘的来信，比如“哦，来自你的秘密爱慕者”。然后人们就会想，“哦，我倒想知道是谁啊。”第二天就忘了。还挺有意思的。
[00:09:34.720] I feel like even back in high school, it seems like Valentine's Day was kind of still like a commercialized version of a holiday. Because all these things are things that you pay for so that
[00:09:34.720] 我觉得即使在高中时期，情人节似乎仍然是一种商业化的节日。因为所有这些东西都需要花钱才能拥有。
[00:09:44.880] someone can know that they're loved. But it's like through the vessel of money and other people doing the work for you. Wow, that's a good point. Not to, you know, be all cynical. Yeah, I guess Valentine's Day is pretty commercialized. Even now, what do you do
[00:09:44.880] 有人能感受到被爱，但这就像是通过金钱和别人的付出来实现的。哇，说得对。我不是要愤世嫉俗。是啊，我觉得情人节已经很商业化了。即使是现在，你又能怎么办呢？
[00:10:01.760] for Valentine's Day? One of the like easiest things to do is have a date and you know, go out and have dinner and that's spending money. So what if this whole thing was created just to
[00:10:01.760] 情人节？最简单的做法之一就是约会，出去吃顿饭，但这要花钱。那么，如果这一切的初衷仅仅是为了……呢？
[00:10:13.200] stimulate the economy? Dude, a true Hallmark holiday. We need to find the origins of Valentine's Day. There's some secret propaganda thing. Yeah, I guess if I think about the way that I've been celebrating Valentine's Day recently, it truly is very much focused on like a dinner date. So
[00:10:13.200] 刺激经济？老兄，这简直就是个商业节日。我们得找到情人节的起源。这背后肯定有什么秘密宣传。是啊，想想我最近庆祝情人节的方式，其实就是约个晚餐。
[00:10:34.080] I think it's almost 5050 in between dinner dates at home and dinner dates outside. I feel like dinner dates outside kind of tend to be some sort of fine dining meal or like a nice meal where we
[00:10:34.080] 我觉得在家吃饭和外出吃饭的比例差不多各占一半。我觉得外出吃饭往往是那种比较精致的晚餐，或者像那种我们一起享用的美好餐点。
[00:10:45.440] both dress up and go on a date. But dinner dates inside I feel like always have a specific pattern. And it's always been James makes steak and some sort of like vegetable side and we have red wine
[00:10:45.440] 两人都会盛装打扮去约会。但我觉得在家吃晚餐的约会总是有固定的模式。通常是詹姆斯做牛排，配一些蔬菜，然后我们喝红酒。
[00:10:57.280] together. That's hella funny. And Crystal and I have made a lot of jokes together about how a steak dinner is a very classic boy meal. It's like the one meal that a guy knows how to cook. So this year,
[00:10:57.280] 一起吃牛排。这太搞笑了。我和克丽丝塔尔经常开玩笑说，牛排晚餐是典型的男生餐。感觉就像男生唯一会做的菜一样。所以今年，
[00:11:09.920] I was like, should we switch it up a little bit? So I think we're gonna go pick up some like sashimi from one of those Japanese markets and slice it ourselves and do like a nice Japanese style dinner
[00:11:09.920] 我当时就想，要不我们换个花样？所以我想我们去日本超市买些生鱼片，自己切，做一顿美味的日式晚餐。
[00:11:21.600] at home. So nice. Not a steak dinner this year. That's that's so funny, because it's literally what I did. Oh, last year. We did we did a dinner date at home and it was literally steak and wine.
[00:11:21.600] 在家。真好。今年没吃牛排大餐了。这太搞笑了，因为我去年就是这么做的。哦，去年我们确实在家约会吃了顿晚餐，就是牛排配葡萄酒。
[00:11:34.960] I think it's so funny because it's it's like maybe the first thing that a lot of guys learn to make but then they learn to make it really well too. So it's like, oh, I mean, I guess I'll take it right?
[00:11:34.960] 我觉得这很有趣，因为这可能是很多男生最先学会做的菜，但他们后来也确实做得很好。所以就好像，哦，我的意思是，我想我应该接受吧？
[00:11:45.440] Like, I just think a lot. So we did do that last year. But this year, I think same thing we're going to the other side of the 5050. We're gonna do a dinner date outside. So we're going to go to like
[00:11:45.440] 我就是喜欢想很多事情。所以我们去年就这么做了。但今年，我想还是一样，我们要去5050的另一边。我们要在户外吃晚餐。所以我们打算去……
[00:11:55.920] a really nice Peruvian restaurant that we like nearby. I feel like I almost always go out for Valentine's Day. Not that I'm opposed to having a dinner like a stay in dinner. But I feel like
[00:11:55.920] 附近有一家我们很喜欢的很棒的秘鲁餐厅。感觉我几乎每年情人节都会出去吃饭。倒不是说我反对在家吃晚餐，只是感觉……
[00:12:08.720] I personally am kind of lazy to cook. And then so I'm like, I don't want to put the onus on my partner. So let's just like go out and have a nice meal. And then that way everyone can relax,
[00:12:08.720] 我个人其实挺懒的，不太喜欢做饭。所以我就想，我不想把负担加在伴侣身上。不如我们出去吃顿好的吧。这样大家都能放松一下。
[00:12:20.240] except spend a lot of money. I actually have a really distinct memory though about going out for a Valentine's Day dinner, where I was talking to a bunch of my coworkers. And I was like, Oh my god,
[00:12:20.240] 除了花很多钱之外。不过，我确实清楚地记得有一次情人节晚上出去吃饭，当时我和一群同事聊天。然后我就想，我的天哪，
[00:12:30.800] like this year, I think James and I are going to drive up to the city and have like a really nice dinner at this one steakhouse, which is somewhat close to my work. And my co workers like, Oh, why
[00:12:30.800] 比如今年，我和詹姆斯打算开车去城里，在一家离我公司比较近的牛排馆好好吃一顿。我的同事们可能会问：“哦，为什么？”
[00:12:39.760] would you go into San Francisco on Valentine's Day? Why would you do that to yourself? And I thought that was a really weird comment where I was like, How dare you like we're gonna enjoy our Valentine's
[00:12:39.760] 你会情人节去旧金山吗？你为什么要那样折磨自己？我觉得这话特别奇怪，心想：你怎么敢这么说？我们情人节可是要好好享受的啊！
[00:12:50.720] Day. But then that day we did go up, we did have the Valentine's Day dinner in the city. And it was indeed a somewhat bad experience for us. Because I feel like with Valentine's Day being such a holiday
[00:12:50.720] 那天，我们确实去了，在城里吃了情人节晚餐。但那确实是一次不太愉快的经历。因为我觉得情人节作为一个节日，应该好好庆祝一番。
[00:13:04.560] of like, oh, everyone is like, let's go out for dinner. It was just so busy. There was like a ton of traffic, impossible to find parking. And then that day specifically, everyone around us was like
[00:13:04.560] 就像，哦，大家都说，咱们出去吃晚饭吧。当时人太多了。交通堵塞，根本找不到停车位。而且那天，我们周围的每个人都……
[00:13:15.280] really drunk at the steakhouse for some reason. So then after that, I was like, Okay, if we're gonna do nice dinners, let's do it maybe like a day before or a day after or let's go out somewhere
[00:13:15.280] 不知道为什么，我在牛排馆喝得酩酊大醉。之后我就想，好吧，如果我们要吃顿好的，不如改到前一天或后一天，或者干脆去别的地方。
[00:13:25.520] down in like the suburbs or like the smaller cities and not the heart of San Francisco Union Square. Yeah, that's fair. I feel like it's really busy during Valentine's Day. And it's the perfect
[00:13:25.520] 是在郊区或者小城市，而不是旧金山联合广场的中心地带。嗯，这很合理。我觉得情人节期间那里真的很拥挤。而且那里非常完美。
[00:13:36.880] excuse for restaurants to like raise their price for that day. And also people oftentimes go and like they're fighting for the reservations. True. I think this year I actually was like, Oh my god,
[00:13:36.880] 这成了餐厅当天涨价的借口。而且人们经常会为了预订位置而争抢。确实如此。我觉得今年我真的感觉，我的天哪，
[00:13:48.880] mark your calendar. Like this is the time when the res releases for this one restaurant that we should go to for Valentine's Day. And so it was like on the dot, we log on and we like get the
[00:13:48.880] 记下日期。比如，这家餐厅的预订会在这个时候开放，我们应该在情人节去那里。所以，我们准时登录，然后就看到了预订信息。
[00:13:58.160] reservation. I didn't know that about the city. That sounds not not very cool to have during Valentine's Day. Just drunk people being belligerent. It was kind of okay, though, because I think James
[00:13:58.160] 预订。我不知道这座城市还有这回事。情人节期间有这种事听起来不太妙。一群喝醉的人闹事。不过，还好，因为我觉得詹姆斯
[00:14:11.360] and I are very much into like the gossip and the TV. So then the couple next to us were like watching. They were like heavily fighting because the guy was really drunk. And we were like, we had like a silent dinner. We're just eavesdropping.
[00:14:11.360] 我特别喜欢八卦和看电视。当时我们旁边那对情侣正在看电视，他们吵得很凶，因为男的喝醉了。我们就默默地吃着晚饭，偷听他们的对话。
[00:14:24.000] That's so funny. So I guess like, nowadays, Valentine's Day is spent celebrating with our SOs. But how about before you were in a committed relationship? Did Valentine's Day have any meaning to you at all? Whether it was like negative or positive? I would say it was
[00:14:24.000] 真有意思。所以我觉得，现在大家过情人节都是为了和另一半一起庆祝。但是，在你恋爱之前呢？情人节对你来说有任何意义吗？无论是积极的还是消极的？我觉得是
[00:14:45.600] for me was pretty normal leaning on negative because there was people will joke that it's like a singles awareness day or whatever, which is the other name of Valentine's Day. For me,
[00:14:45.600] 对我来说，感觉很正常，大家的情绪都倾向于负面，因为有人会开玩笑说这就像单身人士觉醒日之类的，而单身人士觉醒日其实就是情人节的另一个名字。对我来说，
[00:14:55.520] it was a pretty normal day. I wouldn't do anything special. I would just go about my normal day, go to work, go to the gym, play games at home, pretty usual stuff. I do remember like,
[00:14:55.520] 那天很平常。我没做什么特别的事。就跟平常一样，上班，去健身房，在家玩游戏，做些很平常的事。我记得，
[00:15:05.280] since like it is quote unquote, singles awareness days, I think of me and like other single guy friends or maybe get dinner just just to have something to do. While everyone's posting like, you know, how Instagram stories of their dinner dates and fancy restaurants.
[00:15:05.280] 既然今天是所谓的“单身人士关爱日”，我就想着和我的单身男性朋友们一起吃顿饭，打发时间。而其他人却都在Instagram上晒他们的晚餐约会和高档餐厅的照片。
[00:15:19.600] So yeah, let's do that too. I think for me, it was always like slightly positive. Because if I didn't have a boyfriend or a date, I would always celebrate it with my parents. Because you know,
[00:15:19.600] 所以，是啊，我们也这么做吧。我觉得对我来说，这始终有点积极意义。因为如果我没有男朋友或约会对象，我总是会和父母一起庆祝。因为你知道，
[00:15:30.640] the parents are like the couple at home. So then I was like the third wheel, but a welcome third wheel. So we would just get chocolates or I would help my dad get chocolate for my mom,
[00:15:30.640] 父母就像家里的夫妻一样。所以我就成了电灯泡，不过是个受欢迎的电灯泡。所以我们会一起买巧克力，或者我会帮爸爸给妈妈买巧克力。
[00:15:39.760] pick up flowers for her or something like that. So I feel like there was always some sort of direction that it was going to. Oh, wait, then your parents kind of celebrated Valentine's Day?
[00:15:39.760] 比如给她买束花之类的。所以我觉得事情一直都有个大致的方向。哦，等等，那你父母也庆祝情人节吗？
[00:15:48.720] Like sorta, I guess it was more of an excuse to just get like chocolate and flowers and be like, Happy Valentine's Day. And that was kind of like the extent of it all. But we would probably do
[00:15:48.720] 感觉更像是找个借口送巧克力和鲜花，然后说声“情人节快乐”。大概就是这样。但我们可能还是会这么做。
[00:15:57.120] a slightly nicer dinner at home or go out or something like that. Wait, did your parents celebrate Valentine's Day, Daniel? I think pretty similar experience. I remember there being flowers every year. We have roses
[00:15:57.120] 在家吃顿稍微丰盛点的晚餐，或者出去吃点别的什么。等等，丹尼尔，你父母过情人节吗？我觉得我们家的情况差不多。我记得每年家里都会有花。我们家有玫瑰。
[00:16:09.520] in the backyard. So my dad always just like get some from the backyard and put it in a vase for my mom. And then we would have like a slightly nicer dinner, but usually at home. They wouldn't
[00:16:09.520] 在后院。所以我爸爸总是会从后院摘一些花，插在花瓶里给我妈妈。然后我们就会吃一顿稍微好一点的晚餐，但通常是在家里。他们不会
[00:16:20.400] really celebrate on their own, like a slightly special occasion at home. They weren't very like, it wasn't like the classic American Valentine's. Wait, that's kind of genius. Plant roses in the backyard so you never have to like go out and buy roses. And those are expensive.
[00:16:20.400] 他们会自己庆祝，就像在家过一个特别的日子。这跟传统的美国情人节不太一样。等等，这主意真妙！在后院种玫瑰，这样就不用出门买玫瑰了。而且玫瑰很贵。
[00:16:37.440] Especially on Valentine's Day. So true. I'm trying to remember if my parents celebrate it. I don't think they do. But the thing is, their wedding anniversary is close to Valentine's Day. So I think what they usually do
[00:16:37.440] 尤其是在情人节。确实如此。我努力回想我父母是否庆祝情人节。我想他们应该不庆祝。但问题是，他们的结婚纪念日离情人节很近。所以我猜他们通常会怎么做。
[00:16:50.720] is they just celebrate one or the other and they just go and have dinner without me. Esther's birthday is actually like right before Valentine's Day. So sometimes we do like a joint thing. But this year, I think we're doing two different celebrations, birthday party for
[00:16:50.720] 他们是不是只庆祝其中一个节日，然后就撇下我去吃饭？埃丝特的生日其实就在情人节前夕。所以有时候我们会一起庆祝。但今年，我想我们会分别庆祝两个节日，一个是生日派对，另一个是……
[00:17:07.760] her birthday. And then for Valentine's Day, we're gonna do our own dinner thing. Oh, that's nice. Double the gifts for her. Yeah, I guess that's kind of like when your birthday is too close to Christmas. And then
[00:17:07.760] 她的生日。然后情人节，我们打算自己安排晚餐。哦，那太好了。这样她就能收到双倍的礼物了。是啊，我觉得这有点像你的生日离圣诞节太近了。
[00:17:18.080] people try to like package the gifts together. And then people are like, damn, I only get one thing for both of these. I have a friend whose entire family, it's a family of four, and they're all December babies.
[00:17:18.080] 人们总是想把礼物打包在一起。然后就会发现，哎，这两个节日我只能买一样东西。我有个朋友，他们一家四口都是十二月出生的。
[00:17:32.160] So then I think sometimes they do like one big like December party for like all four birthdays plus Christmas plus New Year's. Sad. Or happy. I feel like that could be one huge celebration, which is pretty cool. That's true.
[00:17:32.160] 所以我觉得他们有时候会搞个大型派对，比如十二月一起庆祝四个人的生日、圣诞节和新年。有点伤感，也挺开心的。我觉得那会是一场盛大的庆祝活动，挺酷的。确实如此。
[00:17:48.240] Have you ever done a Galentine's or a Palentine's? Or even attended one? I've actually never. I've never done a Palentine's. I even thought it was supposed to be called like Guy-lentines or something. But actually this year, so this year Esther,
[00:17:48.240] 你有没有过闺蜜情人节（Galentine's）或者男友情人节（Palentine's）？或者参加过？我其实从来没过。我从来没过男友情人节。我甚至以为它应该叫男友情人节（Guy-lentines）之类的。不过今年，埃丝特，今年，
[00:18:05.040] I think is also doing her, I don't think she does Galentine's normally either, but she got invited to one this year. So I think she's going to do one and then all like
[00:18:05.040] 我觉得她也会参加，我也不觉得她平时会搞闺蜜节，但她今年受邀参加了一个。所以我觉得她会参加一次，然后大家都会……
[00:18:14.000] the boyfriends are gonna have nothing to do. So we might all just go hang out somewhere. And then I think the plan is for us to all come back together after like our individual Palentine, Galentines and then have like a joint like hangout or party or something.
[00:18:14.000] 男朋友们肯定没事干。所以我们可能就一起出去玩玩。然后我觉得计划是，在各自的情人节（Palentine 或 Galentines）结束后，我们再聚在一起，搞个集体聚会或者派对什么的。
[00:18:29.200] Oh, that's kind of nice. Oh yeah, that's cute. That's like turning the Valentine's Day thing into more of a community aspect, I feel like. Especially since you all congregate back at the end and celebrate together. Yeah, it'd be fun.
[00:18:29.200] 哦，那挺好的。是啊，真可爱。我觉得这样把情人节变成了一种社区活动。特别是最后大家聚在一起庆祝。是啊，肯定很有趣。
[00:18:45.600] I always wondered like if someone hosts a Galentine's or Palentine's, like do they discriminate against people in relationships? Like is it single people only? I have no idea. I mean, it sounds like everyone's going to be
[00:18:45.600] 我一直很好奇，如果有人举办闺蜜情人节（Galentine's）或情侣情人节（Palentine's），他们会歧视恋爱中的人吗？还是只允许单身人士参加？我完全不知道。我的意思是，听起来好像每个人都会……
[00:19:01.440] in a relationship because like the girls and then the guys, like the other half, we're all going to do our own thing. But I don't know if there are people invited. I don't think we're purposely discriminating, but... Like the segregation is crazy. It might just happen that way.
[00:19:01.440] 在一段关系中，就像女生和男生一样，我们每个人都会做自己的事情。但我不知道是否有人被邀请。我不认为我们是故意歧视，但是……这种隔离太疯狂了。也许事情就是这样发生的。
[00:19:19.360] Dude, that's like a reverse Galentine, Palentine situation. It's like only if you're in a relationship, you're invited to this activity. Taking women and taking men only. Yeah, I've also actually never been to like a Galentine's, I think. But this year,
[00:19:19.360] 老兄，这就像是反过来的闺蜜节/男友节。好像只有恋爱中的人才会被邀请参加这种活动。只邀请女生和男生。是啊，我好像也从来没参加过闺蜜节之类的聚会。不过今年，
[00:19:37.600] I was invited to one. So I'm very, very excited to attend. Wow. This is the year. This is the year we're all going to experience it. I went to a Galentine's last year, but the host was actually in a relationship.
[00:19:37.600] 我受邀参加了一个，所以我非常非常兴奋。哇！今年就是今年！今年我们所有人都能体验到！我去年也参加了一个闺蜜聚会，不过主人当时已经有男朋友了。
[00:19:53.760] But I think it was like her boyfriend was out of town. So she was like, I'm just going to host a Galentine's. And I'm actually not sure if everyone was single there, but the vibe I got was like most people were single.
[00:19:53.760] 但我感觉好像是她男朋友出差了。所以她就想，不如自己办个闺蜜聚会吧。我其实不太确定是不是所有人都单身，但感觉大部分人都是单身。
[00:20:06.560] But I think that was like the only true Galentine's I've had. This year, I don't think I'm invited to one. But maybe you guys didn't get invited to Galentine's or Palentine's before because you're in a relationship. Maybe. Yeah, definitely could be.
[00:20:06.560] 但我觉得那大概是我唯一一次真正意义上的闺蜜节了。今年，我好像没被邀请。不过，也许你们以前没被邀请参加闺蜜节或男友节，是因为你们有伴侣。也许吧。嗯，很有可能。
[00:20:25.040] Although this year, we're starting to break the pattern. I'm trying to go to some Galentine's celebration. Infiltrate. Gotta see what we've been missing out on. Yeah, exactly. So I guess aside from going out to dinner and also aside from celebrating
[00:20:25.040] 不过今年，我们打算打破常规。我打算去参加一些闺蜜聚会。混进去看看。得看看我们错过了什么。没错，就是这样。所以我想，除了出去吃饭和庆祝之外，还有什么其他方式呢？
[00:20:41.040] Valentine's with your friends, how do you guys handle gifts for Valentine's Day with your SOs? I'm a little bit curious because I feel like there's multiple times a year we usually buy gifts for our SOs. So one being Christmas, one being birthdays.
[00:20:41.040] 和朋友们一起过情人节，你们是怎么处理和另一半的情人节礼物问题的呢？我有点好奇，因为我觉得一年中我们通常会给另一半买礼物好几次，比如圣诞节、生日等等。
[00:20:56.080] And I feel like those have kind of bigger expectations. But Valentine's Day, I'm always confused on how big of a gift should I buy? Or is it like a chocolate and roses kind of gift? Or is it like a real gift?
[00:20:56.080] 我觉得人们对情人节的期望更高一些。但情人节，我总是很纠结该买多贵重的礼物？是那种巧克力加玫瑰花的普通礼物？还是应该买一份更贵重的礼物？
[00:21:06.480] So I'm curious to know how you guys handle that. For me, we do real gifts, actually. Plus the flowers and maybe chocolates or something. But I think for us, we definitely do give out gifts. It's another opportunity to give us each other stuff, I guess.
[00:21:06.480] 所以我很想知道你们是怎么处理这件事的。我们家会送真正的礼物，比如鲜花、巧克力之类的。我觉得我们肯定会互赠礼物。这算是我们互相送东西的另一个机会吧。
[00:21:26.560] Maybe just buying things for each other or ourselves. You're like, hey, actually, I've been meaning to get this one thing. Yeah. So yeah, like I said, Esther's birthday is right before Valentine's Day. But I pretty much got her two gifts.
[00:21:26.560] 可能就是互相买点东西，或者给自己买点东西。你会想，嘿，其实我一直想买这个东西。是啊。所以，就像我说的，埃丝特的生日就在情人节前。但我基本上给她买了两个礼物。
[00:21:44.240] When I was buying them, I kind of had to plan out, oh, did I want to buy one big gift? But I ended up doing two, I guess not smaller gifts, but two different things.
[00:21:44.240] 我买礼物的时候，其实得好好计划一下，比如，我是要买一份大礼物呢？但最后我买了两个，应该说不是小礼物，而是两种不同的东西。
[00:21:53.360] But pretty much on the same or equal level as a birthday gift, I would say. It's funny because, oh my god, I bought a gift for her for Valentine's Day. And then she was also getting me something.
[00:21:53.360] 但我觉得它和生日礼物差不多，甚至更贵重。说来也巧，我情人节那天给她买了礼物，结果她也给我买了礼物。
[00:22:04.400] And then since we live together, we get the packages in the mail. We went to pick up our packages the other day. And we looked and it's literally both boxes are from the same place. And we were like, wait, did you buy something from this place?
[00:22:04.400] 因为我们住在一起，所以包裹都是邮寄过来的。前几天我们去取包裹，结果发现两个包裹竟然都是同一个地方寄来的。我们当时就想，等等，你是不是在这个地方买过东西？
[00:22:18.720] It's like, yeah. I think we might have gotten very similar things for each other. It was from Medjury or that jewelry place. But there are two of those boxes and we just had a good laugh about that. That's so cute. You guys are on the same wavelength.
[00:22:18.720] 是啊，我觉得我们可能互送了很相似的礼物。好像是从Medjury或者那家珠宝店买的。不过我们收到了两个这样的盒子，还为此哈哈大笑。真可爱。你们俩真是心有灵犀。
[00:22:35.680] Unintentional matching. I think for me, it kind of depends. But as I'm thinking back, I think Valentine's Day has been a little more small scale for gifts. But my presence is a gift, I guess.
[00:22:35.680] 无意间的巧合。我觉得对我来说，这要看情况。但回想起来，我觉得情人节的礼物规模都比较小。不过，我的陪伴本身就是一种礼物，我想。
[00:22:53.040] Okay, to be fair though, in the past, I've been in a long distance relationship. So I would literally fly over to wherever the other person is. So that's a pretty good gift, right? That's true. That's actually monetary value next to that as well.
[00:22:53.040] 好吧，公平地说，我以前谈过异地恋。所以我会直接飞过去见对方。所以这算是一份很棒的礼物，对吧？没错。而且这礼物还有实际的金钱价值。
[00:23:09.520] Probably more expensive than the two gifts I bought. But yeah, since I would usually fly over, we would plan an experience essentially. So I feel like that is also a good alternative to gifts. But that's true. If I were wanting something, it would be the perfect excuse.
[00:23:09.520] 可能比我买的那两件礼物还贵。不过，因为我通常会飞过去，所以我们基本上会安排一次体验。我觉得这也是个不错的礼物替代方案。确实如此。如果我想要什么，这倒是个完美的借口。
[00:23:28.880] Oh, Valentine's Day is coming up. Maybe we should do gifts this year. Yeah, I think I'm kind of similar to you, Crystal. Well, not like the flight stuff. But I kind of consider Valentine's to be slightly smaller scale than a birthday, for example.
[00:23:28.880] 哦，情人节快到了。也许我们今年应该互送礼物。嗯，我觉得我和你有点像，克丽丝塔尔。当然，除了飞行那方面。但我觉得情人节的规模比生日之类的要小一些。
[00:23:42.400] But I have in the past kind of played myself a little bit. Where sometimes I'm like, is Valentine's Day like a real holiday? So I'll be like, let's not do gifts, right? And then I'll end up feeling bad. So I'll buy a small gift.
[00:23:42.400] 但我过去也曾有过类似的经历。有时候我会想，情人节真的算是个节日吗？所以我就会想，那咱们就别互送礼物了吧？结果最后我又会觉得愧疚。所以我会买一份小礼物。
[00:23:56.560] And then James taking my word at face value, he won't get me anything. Because he's like, oh, she said no gifts. And then when we do the gift exchange, I'm like, wait, what the fuck? Where's my gift? So I try not to do that anymore.
[00:23:56.560] 然后詹姆斯就信了我的话，什么也不给我买。因为他会说，哦，她说过不要礼物。然后等到交换礼物的时候，我就想，等等，搞什么鬼？我的礼物呢？所以我现在尽量避免这种情况了。
[00:24:13.840] That's your own fault. Yeah. Definitely played myself a little bit. I can totally see James being like, bro, you said no gifts. I'm like the worst about it. I'm also always like, yeah, don't get me flowers. They like die and I'm like allergic.
[00:24:13.840] 那都是你自己的错。是啊。我确实有点儿自作自受。我完全能想象詹姆斯会说：“兄弟，你不是说不要礼物吗？” 我在这方面真是最糟糕的。我总是说：“是啊，别送我花。花都枯萎了，而且我对花过敏。”
[00:24:29.440] But when I have flowers, I'm like super happy about it. James is like, can you pick a lane and just tell me what to do? But actually Esther, I think in the beginning she said the same thing. She's like, flowers are dumb.
[00:24:29.440] 但如果有人送花，我会特别开心。詹姆斯就说，你能不能直接告诉我该怎么做？其实埃丝特一开始也这么说过，她觉得花很傻。
[00:24:39.680] I'd rather just get plants because she's really big into plants. So one year, I don't remember if I didn't get her flowers or not. But I think she got flowers from her co-worker. And she was like, wow, look at this. Like, I feel so happy getting these flowers.
[00:24:39.680] 我更愿意送她盆栽，因为她特别喜欢植物。有一年，我不记得我有没有送她花，但我想她同事送了她花。她当时就说：“哇，你看这些花！” 她好像说：“收到这些花我好开心。”
[00:24:51.200] And I was like, hmm, all right. And then I got her flowers. Actually, I feel like that's such a classic conflict. I've definitely seen that happen before with someone's newer relationship where the girl was like, no gifts, no flowers, don't worry.
[00:24:51.200] 我当时就想，嗯，好吧。然后我就给她买了花。其实，我觉得这真是个很经典的矛盾。我以前也见过类似的情况，在刚开始交往的情侣里，女生会说，不要礼物，不要花，别担心。
[00:25:10.400] And then the guy truly just takes that at face value. And then the girl's like, yo, what the fuck? I'm kind of upset. I feel like maybe it wouldn't be. But then you start seeing maybe on social media or something.
[00:25:10.400] 然后那男的居然就信以为真了。那女的就懵了，心想：卧槽，这都什么跟什么啊？我有点生气。我觉得也许本来不会这样。但后来你可能在社交媒体之类的平台上看到过。
[00:25:23.120] You're like, hmm, what are all these flowers people are getting? Now I want some. Yeah, that's fair. And I also wonder, though, so girls always get to get flowers as the typical or standard kind of thing. But what is the equivalent of flowers for guys?
[00:25:23.120] 你会想，嗯，大家收到的这些花都是干嘛的？我也想要一些。是啊，这很正常。不过我也在想，女生总是能收到鲜花，这似乎是理所当然的。那么男生收到的相当于鲜花的礼物是什么呢？
[00:25:39.840] Would you feel happy receiving flowers? I mean, yeah. Yes, I would. But I guess it'd be a similar thing where I probably wouldn't need them. But it would be nice to just have just because. Like, I personally wouldn't probably care if I got flowers or not.
[00:25:39.840] 你会喜欢收到花吗？嗯，会的。是的，我会。但我想这可能跟我并不需要花的情况差不多。不过，收到花当然很好，只是因为想收到而已。比如，我个人可能根本不在乎有没有花。
[00:25:56.160] But if I did, it's like I'd be unhappy. Right? Right. Every time Valentine's Day comes around, I always wonder in my head, like, what is the equivalent for guys? So what I've done before is like instead of a heart-shaped box of chocolate,
[00:25:56.160] 但如果我那样做，我反而会不开心。对吧？对。每到情人节，我总会在心里琢磨，男生该送什么礼物呢？所以我以前的做法是，不送心形巧克力盒，
[00:26:12.560] it was like a heart-shaped box of jerky. I was like totally not expecting you to say that. That was a creative and unique gift. I would appreciate that, too. But then I know a lot of guys are sometimes like, oh, I would love to get flowers, too.
[00:26:12.560] 那就像一盒心形的牛肉干。我当时完全没想到你会这么说。那真是一份既有创意又独特的礼物。我也会很喜欢的。不过我知道很多男生有时候也会说，哦，我也很喜欢收到鲜花。
[00:26:34.960] Flower away. I feel like the thing about flowers, though, especially when you live with an SO, is gifting it to your SO who lives with you is basically like gifting it to yourself as well. Because I feel like a lot of the presentness
[00:26:34.960] 送花吧。我觉得送花这件事，尤其是在和伴侣同住的时候，其实就是把花送给自己。因为我觉得很多时候，当下感才是最重要的。
[00:26:49.520] or like the value of flowers is just like the happiness you get when you look at them, but you live together. So it's like here's a gift for you, but also for myself. Do double happiness. Oh, true. You don't have to look at it.
[00:26:49.520] 或者说，花的价值就像你看着它们时获得的快乐，但你们生活在一起。所以这就像是送给你的礼物，也是送给我自己的。双倍的快乐。哦，对。你不一定要看它。
[00:27:00.800] So this year, Valentine's Day is coming up, so I was talking to my SO about it and I was like, oh, we don't have to do gifts this year. And then he was like, oh, but like can I still get you flowers?
[00:27:00.800] 今年情人节快到了，我和我的另一半聊起这件事，我说，哦，我们今年不用互送礼物了。然后他说，哦，那我还能送你花吗？
[00:27:12.720] And I was like, oh sure, if you want. So I feel like that clarification is maybe like helpful if girls were to be like, no gifts, but flowers, okay. I like that though. I feel like there's also a little bit of intentionality in that.
[00:27:12.720] 我当时就想，哦，当然可以，如果你想的话。我觉得如果女生想说“不要礼物，但可以送花”，那这个澄清可能就很有用了。我喜欢这样。我觉得这里面也包含了一些用心。
[00:27:28.480] Oh, I respect that you don't want to do gifts, but I would still like to get you something. Versus like, oh, let's not do gifts. And the guy's like, oh, thank God. There's still like a gesture behind it. Yeah.
[00:27:28.480] 哦，我尊重你不想送礼物，但我还是想送你点什么。而不是像那样，哦，我们还是别送礼物了。然后对方会说，哦，谢天谢地。这样心里还是有份心意的。是啊。
[00:27:39.760] I think one of the things too that Valentine's Day makes me think about, this is kind of like the one day a year where officially everyone is supposed to celebrate love and whatnot. But I feel like the other 364 days a year,
[00:27:39.760] 我觉得情人节让我想到的一件事是，这一天似乎是每年唯一一天，大家都应该正式庆祝爱情之类的。但我觉得一年中的其他364天，
[00:27:52.480] you're also obligated to like love and support your SO. Obligated? Contractually obligated. I know on Valentine's Day, we talked about how a lot of it is like gift giving and nice dinners. But aside from Valentine's Day,
[00:27:52.480] 你也有义务喜欢、爱护和支持你的伴侣。义务？是合同义务。我知道在情人节那天，我们讨论过很多时候情人节的意义在于送礼物和享用浪漫晚餐。但除了情人节之外，
[00:28:08.240] how do you guys think you try to make your SO feel special or vice versa in your relationship? Honestly, so it's not actually too different from how we normally show each other appreciation. So like Valentine's Day, we'll cook for each other. We'll have a nice dinner.
[00:28:08.240] 你们在恋爱关系中会如何让另一半感受到特别的爱意，或者反过来呢？说实话，其实和我们平时表达爱意的方式并没有太大区别。比如情人节，我们会互相做饭，一起享用一顿丰盛的晚餐。
[00:28:23.200] But we do those things pretty regularly too. Maybe like we used to do literally once a week, but maybe once a month now. One thing that I really appreciate that Esther does for me is cooking just in general. If I'm having a really busy day,
[00:28:23.200] 但我们也会经常做这些事。以前可能一周一次，现在大概一个月一次吧。我特别感激埃丝特为我做的一件事就是做饭。如果我那天特别忙，
[00:28:35.680] she'll cook a meal that I like to eat since I don't have time to worry about food. Or just if I'm out, she'll clean the apartment just so that everything is nice and things are set when I come back home.
[00:28:35.680] 因为我没时间操心吃饭，她会做我爱吃的饭菜。或者如果我不在家，她会把公寓打扫干净，这样我回家的时候一切都井井有条。
[00:28:48.000] Those are things that we do for each other. I'll do that for her too to show appreciation. And Valentine's Day is kind of just... It's all very similar, I think. We just kind of spend time with each other. I think on my end,
[00:28:48.000] 这些都是我们彼此会做的事情。我也会为她做这些事来表达我的感激之情。情人节其实也差不多……我觉得都差不多。我们只是会花些时间在一起。就我而言，
[00:29:02.080] one thing me and my partner try to do is we try to be intentional about the time that we spend together. Making specific plans and actually doing activities. Because the way I kind of think about it is in the future,
[00:29:02.080] 我和伴侣努力做到的一点是，我们会刻意安排在一起的时间，制定具体的计划，并真正去做一些事情。因为我思考问题的方式是，在未来，
[00:29:17.920] once we reach the point of moving in together, then we're kind of constantly together. So the time that we spend together is probably a little less intentional by nature because we're just constantly together. And I guess it's a little harder to carve out us time
[00:29:17.920] 一旦我们同居，基本上就形影不离了。所以我们相处的时间可能就没那么刻意安排了，因为我们一直都在一起。我想，这样一来，要挤出时间单独相处就更难了。
[00:29:34.240] versus this is just how things are. So now it's being specific and clear about things that we're doing. I think that's a really good point because I think you're right once you do live together, it is kind of coexisting a lot of the times
[00:29:34.240] 而不是像现在这样，事情就是这样。所以现在我们要具体、清楚地说明我们正在做的事情。我觉得这一点非常重要，因为你说的没错，一旦住在一起，很多时候就变成了一种共存。
[00:29:52.240] and then us time is very specific times. I think for me and James, especially when we're really busy, we have our podcast stuff and book club calls and all this other stuff going on. Then when we'll catch up is right before we sleep, we'll watch TikToks together,
[00:29:52.240] 然后，我们俩的专属时间就非常具体了。我觉得我和詹姆斯，尤其是在我们特别忙的时候，比如我们有播客节目、读书俱乐部电话会议等等各种事情要做。然后我们只有在睡前才能聚在一起，一起看看TikTok。
[00:30:08.480] share a moment instead of the rest of the day when we're running around trying to catch up with our own lives. I think in a way, Valentine's Day is, as I mentioned, a fake holiday, but still a good holiday
[00:30:08.480] 与其整天忙着应付自己的生活，不如抽出一点时间陪伴彼此。我觉得从某种意义上说，情人节就像我之前提到的那样，是个“人为的节日”，但仍然是个不错的节日。
[00:30:20.480] because you are kind of pointedly celebrating us time together and making it a big occasion. But I think a lot of the way that love comes through on daily lives is like what Daniel was saying, right? Like, oh, someone's really busy,
[00:30:20.480] 因为你似乎刻意地庆祝我们在一起的时光，把它搞得像个大日子。但我认为，爱在日常生活中体现的方式，就像丹尼尔说的那样，对吧？比如，哦，有人真的很忙，
[00:30:34.640] so you clean for the person you love or you remind them gently to call their parents or all these little things that kind of help them live their life in a very regulated and positive manner and you're just supporting each other.
[00:30:34.640] 所以你会为你爱的人打扫卫生，或者温柔地提醒他们给父母打电话，或者做所有这些小事，这些都能帮助他们以非常有规律和积极的方式生活，你们只是在互相支持。
[00:30:49.200] I feel like it's two different types of love when I think about it. Yeah, I think Valentine's Day just gives you another opportunity to be intentional about that us time because I'm sure we all do it already on a regular basis, on the weekends.
[00:30:49.200] 仔细想想，我觉得这是两种不同的爱。是啊，我觉得情人节只是给了我们另一个机会，让我们更有意识地安排二人世界的时间，因为我相信我们平时周末都会这样做。
[00:31:04.080] I'm sure you have dinner dates or whatever. It's not as special as Valentine's Day, but it is pretty much the same thing. So when Valentine's comes around, it's just another opportunity to do that with the added flowers and all the specialness around the holiday
[00:31:04.080] 我相信你们也会有晚餐约会之类的。虽然不如情人节那么特别，但本质上差不多。所以情人节到来的时候，只不过多了鲜花和节日特有的氛围，就成了你们约会的又一个机会而已。
[00:31:18.720] or whatever, the commercialized stuff. It is nice because it sets that specific us time apart from the normal us time. Yeah, I feel like it's a good reminder too because it's kind of like, hey, it's Valentine's Day. Don't forget to put aside some time
[00:31:18.720] 或者说，那些商业化的玩意儿。它的好处在于，它能把我们俩的专属时光和普通的二人世界区分开来。是啊，我觉得它也是一个很好的提醒，就像在说：“嘿，今天是情人节，别忘了留出点时间。”
[00:31:36.640] and really do something nice for your relationship or whatever. Yeah, just appreciate each other. Damn, low-key I feel like me and James don't do a ton of dinner dates. Yeah, we don't either, but sometimes on the weekends, we'll go to H Mart or something
[00:31:36.640] 真的应该为你们的关系做点好事什么的。对，要懂得珍惜彼此。哎，说实话，我觉得我和詹姆斯好像很少一起吃晚餐。是啊，我们也不怎么经常约会，不过有时候周末我们会去H Mart之类的超市。
[00:31:51.840] and then the sashimi thing you said, we do that sometimes just on Sundays because we'll be at H Mart and we see sashimi and be like, oh, let's do sashimi lunch and then that's something you would do for Valentine's Day,
[00:31:51.840] 至于你提到的生鱼片，我们有时会在周日吃，因为我们会在H Mart超市看到生鱼片，然后就会想，哦，我们吃生鱼片午餐吧，然后你就会想到情人节吃生鱼片。
[00:32:03.280] but also we would do it on a random Sunday, I guess. Yeah, that makes sense. Since you both live with your... Do you think there was an adjustment period where in the beginning it was really easy to kind of lose track of things
[00:32:03.280] 但我想我们也会随机选个周日做。嗯，有道理。既然你们俩都和……你觉得是不是有个适应期，一开始很容易有点儿丢三落四？
[00:32:17.840] and maybe do less date nights or did you feel like it just was very natural? For me, it was pretty natural. I think even after we moved in together, we would do date night Thursdays. So we would just do either dinner out or eat at home.
[00:32:17.840] 或许你们约会的次数会减少，还是觉得一切都很自然？对我来说，一切都很自然。我觉得即使我们同居之后，每周四晚上我们还是会约会。我们会出去吃晚餐，或者在家吃。
[00:32:34.000] More recently, we've been more busy, so we haven't really done that as much this month, but we always talk about how we want to do more and then Valentine's Day kind of... Again, it just gives us that opportunity, right? If you're too busy normally,
[00:32:34.000] 最近我们比较忙，所以这个月没怎么做这件事，但我们一直都想多做一些，而情人节……正好给了我们这个机会，对吧？如果你平时太忙，
[00:32:46.400] then Valentine's Day is a good chance to catch up and have that day to appreciate each other when things are busy. I think for me, when we first moved in together, it felt a lot easier to set up time to hang out
[00:32:46.400] 那么，情人节就是一个很好的机会，让大家在忙碌的时候也能好好相处，享受彼此的陪伴。我觉得对我来说，我们刚开始同居的时候，安排时间相处要容易得多。
[00:33:00.640] because you're literally under the same roof, right? So it's like, oh, we can do date nights and every meal is kind of like it's us time and things like that. But then I feel like at a certain point, life caught up to us a little bit.
[00:33:00.640] 因为你们就住在同一个屋檐下，对吧？所以感觉就像，哦，我们可以约会，每顿饭都像是我们的二人世界之类的。但后来我觉得，到了某个时候，生活还是有点儿追不上我们了。
[00:33:11.200] So days where we work late through the night or have other calls and meetings and whatever, I felt like it was actually a little bit harder because it's kind of like you have your date night time. So if you don't live together, you enjoy the time together
[00:33:11.200] 所以，如果哪天我们工作到深夜，或者有其他电话、会议之类的，我觉得其实会更难一些，因为这就像你们的约会时间被挤占了一样。如果你们不住在一起，就很难享受在一起的时光。
[00:33:26.000] and then you go home and then you tackle the other things in life that you need to tackle. But for us, we're under the same roof, right? So I sometimes felt like while we were eating dinner or something, I would be thinking about all the things
[00:33:26.000] 然后你回家，再去处理生活中其他需要处理的事情。但我们住在同一屋檐下，对吧？所以有时候我觉得，当我们一起吃晚饭的时候，我会想着所有的事情。
[00:33:36.720] that I would have to do. So then I feel like there's less of a separation there of like, oh, I'm gonna immerse myself in this. It's harder to snap out of it and snap into it because it's kind of the same space
[00:33:36.720] 我必须这么做。所以我觉得两者之间的界限就不那么清晰了，就像“哦，我要全身心投入其中”一样。很难从中抽离出来再重新投入，因为它们本质上是同一个空间。
[00:33:46.560] where you would do all your chores and you look around and you're like, oh, I have to clean the house and whatnot. So I think it's kind of like a balancing act. And I think now that a lot of our like, wedding obligations are done,
[00:33:46.560] 你会做完所有家务，环顾四周，然后想，哦，我还要打扫房子什么的。所以我觉得这有点像是在走平衡之路。而且我觉得现在我们很多婚礼相关的义务都完成了，
[00:33:57.520] it definitely does feel a little bit easier. But I think we kind of had to go through that a little bit to kind of find what works for us. Esther and I are both, we love to stay home and like just play games.
[00:33:57.520] 确实感觉轻松了一些。但我觉得我们得经历这个过程才能找到适合自己的方法。我和埃丝特都喜欢待在家里玩游戏。
[00:34:09.520] So a lot of times nowadays when it's like Thursday night where we normally go out on a date, we'd be like, we just look at each other and be like, can we just stay home and play games today?
[00:34:09.520] 所以现在很多时候，比如周四晚上我们通常会出去约会的时候，我们就会互相看着对方说，我们今天能不能待在家里玩游戏呢？
[00:34:17.600] And then we both agree, we're like, yeah, that sounds nice. And then we end up just doing that at like our desk. I mean, I feel like that can easily be categorized as a date night still because you're like, I'm assuming playing games together. Yeah, yeah, true.
[00:34:17.600] 然后我们俩都同意了，觉得“嗯，听起来不错”。然后我们就在办公桌前一起玩游戏了。我觉得这完全可以算作约会之夜，因为你们是在一起玩游戏。对，对，没错。
[00:34:31.600] I mean, I guess it's gaming date night every night. Yeah, yeah. And you know, some games out there really put your teamwork to the test. So... Oh yeah, been there with the Valorant fights. You guys should play It Takes Two. Is that a co-op game? Yeah, it is.
[00:34:31.600] 我的意思是，感觉每天晚上都像是在玩游戏约会一样。是啊，是啊。你知道，有些游戏真的非常考验团队合作。所以……哦，对了，我玩过《Valorant》的战斗。你们应该玩玩《It Takes Two》。那是合作游戏吗？是的。
[00:34:53.200] We've been trying to find more co-op games because we're both really into like super competitive, like grindy, sweaty multiplayer games like Valorant, like TFT where we're both, we both get really tilted sometimes. So we're like, maybe we should find a co-op game where we can actually relax.
[00:34:53.200] 我们一直在寻找更多合作游戏，因为我们俩都特别喜欢那种超级竞技、需要大量肝、让人汗流浃背的多人游戏，比如《Valorant》和《云顶之弈》，玩这些游戏我们俩有时候都会心态爆炸。所以我们就想，或许我们应该找一款能让我们真正放松的合作游戏。
[00:35:10.560] Dude, you should do like It Takes Two. Another fun one is called We Were Here and it's like a four game series. And it's all about like communication and teamwork. Well, I think I played It Takes Two with James but at one point James was clutching both controllers.
[00:35:10.560] 哥们儿，你应该玩玩《It Takes Two》。还有个挺好玩的叫《We Were Here》，好像是四部曲系列。这游戏讲的是沟通和团队合作。嗯，我好像跟詹姆斯一起玩过《It Takes Two》，不过有那么一刻，詹姆斯居然同时抓着两个手柄。
[00:35:30.960] He was like playing for both. I was like, sorry. I don't know how to do this. It takes one, he said. Actually, I guess another big one is like Overcooked, right? Oh, true. But when it first came out, I was just like,
[00:35:30.960] 他好像同时在为两边效力。我当时就想，抱歉，我不知道该怎么做。他说，只需要一个就够了。其实，我想另一个很火的游戏是《胡闹厨房》（Overcooked），对吧？哦，没错。但它刚出来的时候，我当时就想，
[00:35:47.120] dude, I don't have time to like play with other people. So I just soloed the whole thing. Oh my God. So, you know. I don't think we're playing these co-op games, right? I guess back onto the Valentine's Day topic a little bit.
[00:35:47.120] 老兄，我没时间跟别人一起玩。所以我全程单人通关了。我的天。所以，你知道的。我觉得我们玩不了合作游戏，对吧？看来我们还是稍微回到情人节的话题吧。
[00:36:07.740] Do you feel like there's anything you do in addition to what you regularly do that makes Valentine's Day feel more special? Because I guess we talked a little bit about having the day there officially is in itself a little bit nice and different.
[00:36:07.740] 除了日常的庆祝方式之外，你有没有做些什么让情人节感觉更特别的事情？因为我觉得我们之前也聊过，把情人节定为官方节日本身就有点美好和特别。
[00:36:25.420] But do you make your gestures more grand? Or is there anything else that you do on top of that? Or is it just kind of like another set date night? I think this is kind of a funny question
[00:36:25.420] 但你会让你的举动更隆重吗？或者除此之外你还会做些什么？还是说这只是又一次例行的约会之夜？我觉得这个问题挺有意思的。
[00:36:38.060] because the other day I was hanging out with my good friend and she was like, oh, are you going to do a Valentine's Day card for James? I was kind of thinking about it and I was like,
[00:36:38.060] 因为前几天我和我好朋友一起玩，她问我：“哦，你打算给詹姆斯做情人节卡片吗？” 我当时正在考虑这件事，然后我就说：
[00:36:48.220] it's been a while since I really sat and wrote a card. I think I used to a lot more in college. But after we moved in together, I don't recall the time that I did for Valentine's Day. My friend actually lives with her as well.
[00:36:48.220] 我已经很久没有认真坐下来写贺卡了。我想大学的时候我写得比较多。但自从我们同居之后，我就记不清上次写情人节贺卡是什么时候了。我的朋友也和她住在一起。
[00:37:01.260] So I was like, oh no, I don't think we're going to do one. Like, do you do one? And she said that every year she always writes her a Valentine's Day card even though they live together, even though he already knows that she loves him
[00:37:01.260] 所以我就想，哦不，我觉得我们可能没法写情人节卡片了。你写吗？她说，即使他们住在一起，即使他已经知道她爱他，她每年都会给她写情人节卡片。
[00:37:12.940] because she's like, why would you? Sometimes when you put pen to paper, thoughts and feelings come up more or better than the way that they would come out of your mouth basically. And I thought that was really striking because she's totally right.
[00:37:12.940] 因为她会说，你为什么要这么做？有时候，当你把想法和感受写在纸上时，它们会比你用嘴说出来更清晰、更强烈地表达出来。我觉得这一点非常精辟，因为她说的完全正确。
[00:37:27.820] I think when I sit down to write a card, things come to mind that I normally wouldn't necessarily say out loud. So that's kind of one of the things that I'm going to try to do this year, write him a little Valentine's Day card.
[00:37:27.820] 我觉得当我坐下来写卡片的时候，脑海里会浮现出一些我平时不一定会说出口的话。所以，今年我打算尝试做一件事，给他写一张情人节卡片。
[00:37:39.260] Are you going to get a cars themed one? With a nerds candy in it. That's cute. That is true. I think putting things on paper is definitely different. For me, yeah. I think the thing that sets it apart from the dinner date we kind of already touched upon,
[00:37:39.260] 你会买个汽车主题的吗？里面放点糖果。真可爱。确实如此。我觉得把事情写下来肯定不一样。对我来说，是的。我觉得它和我们之前提到的晚餐约会最大的区别在于……
[00:37:53.580] but it's like the classic Valentine's things. Like I got her a bouquet of flowers that'll come in like on Valentine's Day and I'll try to set it up. I guess a lot of it is, yeah, like the traditions, like getting flowers and really having the intention
[00:37:53.580] 但就像经典的情人节习俗一样。比如我会给她准备一束花，情人节那天送到，我会尽量安排好一切。我想很多时候，是的，就像传统一样，比如送花，以及真正用心准备。
[00:38:08.620] that you set aside time for this day. I guess, especially because Valentine's Day is not always on the weekend. So it's like, oh yeah, like even if it's a busy weekday, we'll try to set aside time just because it's Valentine's Day. So that in itself
[00:38:08.620] 你要抽出时间来庆祝这一天。我想，尤其因为情人节并不总是在周末。所以，即使是忙碌的工作日，我们也会尽量抽出时间来庆祝，就因为是情人节。仅此而已。
[00:38:21.820] and the intention of it all is kind of special too. Yeah, I'm thinking for me and I think I'm similar to Daniel where it's kind of just like, yeah, you know, we go through the traditions and then nothing else is like necessarily important.
[00:38:21.820] 这一切背后的意义也很特别。是啊，我觉得我和丹尼尔很像，就是那种，你知道，我们遵循传统，然后其他的一切似乎都不那么重要了。
[00:38:35.980] Nothing else is like necessarily super extra. Yeah, I guess the gift giving is also different. You don't give gifts normally on a regular dinner date. But I guess that's almost like better that Valentine's Day isn't so different from your other days because if it were so different,
[00:38:35.980] 其他方面倒也没什么特别的。嗯，我觉得送礼物的方式也不一样。平时约会吃饭一般不会送礼物。不过我觉得这样也好，情人节跟其他日子没那么大差别，不然就太不一样了。
[00:38:55.900] it's like, well, why? Right? Like why can't you do this? Do not love each other normally. Actually kind of touching on that, I think Daniel spoke a little bit about it earlier, but I always find scrolling through social media on Valentine's Day very interesting
[00:38:55.900] 感觉就像，嗯，为什么？对吧？为什么不能这样？不能像平常一样相爱呢？其实我刚才也稍微提到了这一点，我觉得丹尼尔之前也说过一点，但我总是觉得在情人节刷社交媒体很有意思。
[00:39:11.740] because I think each couple has a very different approach to social media, to gifts, to Valentine's Day in general. So I was like, oh, this person celebrates it like this. And sometimes I'm like, whoa, they like really went all out for Valentine's Day.
[00:39:11.740] 因为我觉得每对情侣对待社交媒体、礼物以及情人节的态度都截然不同。所以我会想，哦，这个人是这样庆祝的。有时候我又会想，哇，他们情人节真的太用心了。
[00:39:25.500] Oh my God, the funniest thing was maybe two years ago during Valentine's Day, I was looking through my Instagram stories and literally I saw maybe like 10 or 15 stories in a row of couples going on a sushi date for Valentine's. Like classic.
[00:39:25.500] 我的天哪，最搞笑的是，大概两年前的情人节那天，我翻看我的Instagram故事，竟然连续看到10到15条情侣情人节去吃寿司的动态。真是经典啊。
[00:39:42.300] Dude, I'm wondering now if IG stories on Valentine's Day are the new Valentine's Day cards we used to pass around in elementary school. Oh my God. Well, this was really fun to kind of take a trip down memory lane all the way from elementary school
[00:39:42.300] 老兄，我现在在想，情人节的Instagram故事会不会就成了我们小学时互相传阅的情人节卡片的新潮流了。我的天哪。不过，这趟从小学开始的怀旧之旅真的很有趣。
[00:39:58.780] to now as working adults and see how we have celebrated Valentine's Day in different ways over the years. So thank you, Daniel, for joining us and sharing all your Valentine's Day stories with us. For our listeners out there, hopefully this gave you a couple of ideas
[00:39:58.780] 如今我们都已长大成人，步入职场，回顾过往，也看到了这些年来我们庆祝情人节的方式发生了怎样的变化。丹尼尔，非常感谢你加入我们，与我们分享你的情人节故事。希望这些故事能给听众朋友们带来一些灵感。
