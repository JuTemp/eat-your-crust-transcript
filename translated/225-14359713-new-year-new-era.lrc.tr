[00:00:00.430] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. It's been a while since we've said that. Feels a little bit weird to say, but we're happy to be back. Yeah, we took a little bit of a longer break this holiday season
[00:00:00.430] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。我们好久没这么说了。感觉有点怪怪的，不过我们很高兴能回来。是的，这个假期我们休息的时间稍微长了点。
[00:00:28.050] because a lot was going on. I feel like it was a good break too. It was funny because about a week ago or something, you texted me and you're like, life has gone on so long without podcast duties. Yeah, I guess for a while.
[00:00:28.050] 因为当时发生了很多事。我觉得这也是个不错的休息机会。挺有意思的，大概一周前，你给我发短信说，好久没做播客了。是啊，确实有一段时间了。
[00:00:44.090] I mean, definitely when we're in the season, podcast duties are such a normal part of our routine. But I was abroad and you were off for Christmas break and everything like that. So I was like, I can't remember what it was like to upload podcast episodes anymore.
[00:00:44.090] 我的意思是，当然，在节目播出期间，录制播客是我们日常工作的一部分。但我当时在国外，你们也放圣诞假什么的。所以我就想，我都记不清上传播客节目是什么感觉了。
[00:00:57.290] I definitely had that thought too. I was like, oh my God, it's like Tuesday and we're free. Yeah, exactly. I don't have plans. There were like a couple of our podcast meetings that were still on the calendar that we forgot to remove for the break.
[00:00:57.290] 我当时也这么想的。我就想，天哪，今天是星期二，我们空闲。对，没错。我没有安排。我们之前有几个播客会议还留在日程表上，我们忘了在假期期间把它们删掉。
[00:01:12.810] And then I just watched them like pop up and I was like, oh, I feel like this used to be a thing for us. But as much as it was nice having some time off, it does feel really exciting to be back.
[00:01:12.810] 然后我就看着它们突然冒出来，心想，哦，感觉这以前也是我们的生活啊。虽然休息一段时间很不错，但回归真的让人很兴奋。
[00:01:25.370] I feel like the first episode that we always record for the new season, we always talk about our New Year's resolutions a bit. But this time, Crystal and I were chatting a bit and she had an idea to do the resolutions in a slightly different manner this year.
[00:01:25.370] 我觉得我们每年录制新一季的第一集节目，都会聊聊各自的新年计划。但这次，我和克丽丝塔尔聊天的时候，她想今年用一种稍微不同的方式来讨论新年计划。
[00:01:39.850] Yeah. So the typical way people kind of approach resolutions is like, what are some goals? And sometimes these goals can be pretty grandiose or sometimes they're a little vague, like this year I want to start doing this or I want to get better at this.
[00:01:39.850] 是的。人们制定新年计划的典型方式是，设定一些目标。有时这些目标可能相当宏大，有时则比较模糊，比如“今年我想开始做这件事”或者“我想在这方面有所提高”。
[00:01:56.450] But it's kind of hard to measure and stuff. So I was kind of reflecting over New Year's time and I kind of realized, and this is partially thanks to the podcast too, that I kind of had a theme unintentionally last
[00:01:56.450] 但这很难衡量之类的。所以在新年期间我一直在反思，然后我意识到（这也部分要归功于播客），我无意中形成了一个主题。
[00:02:12.330] year. So I was like, oh, maybe this year I'll set like a theme as well. I think last year's theme was kind of do new things, which we talked about around the beginning of the year.
[00:02:12.330] 所以我就想，哦，也许今年我也该定个主题。我觉得去年的主题是尝试新事物，我们在年初的时候就讨论过这个问题。
[00:02:23.930] And so I was kind of thinking about what could be an appropriate theme for this year. What I came up with, it's a little vague, but it's basically to rediscover youthful energy. Kind of an interesting story, actually. I was looking through some old notes on my phone.
[00:02:23.930] 所以我一直在思考今年的主题应该是什么。我想到的有点笼统，但基本上就是重拾青春活力。其实这背后还有个挺有意思的故事。我当时正在翻看手机里的一些旧笔记。
[00:02:42.610] I scrolled all the way to the bottom and I was like, whoa, some of these notes I kept really show the kind of person I was or like the kind of interests I had. And I don't know if I show that kind of energy in my life now.
[00:02:42.610] 我一直往下翻，然后我就想，哇，我以前记的这些笔记真的反映了我以前是什么样的人，或者说我以前的兴趣爱好。我不知道我现在的生活中是否还保留着那种活力。
[00:02:56.130] One note in particular was literally a list of fonts that I liked because I was so passionate about design and everything that I would literally follow new font releases. Oh, my God. I honestly did not know that this concept even existed.
[00:02:56.130] 其中有一张笔记简直就是我喜欢的字体列表，因为我当时对设计无比热爱，所以会密切关注每一款新字体的发布。我的天哪！我之前竟然不知道还有这种概念。
[00:03:13.410] So I was like, oh, my God, like I was so excited about this stuff. Hopefully I can kind of keep a mindset to, you know, have that kind of youthful energy and passion again in things that I do. I really like that, actually.
[00:03:13.410] 所以当时我就想，天哪，我对这些事情太兴奋了。希望我能保持这种心态，重新拥有那种年轻的活力和热情。我真的很喜欢那种感觉。
[00:03:26.530] And I feel like the theme setting does help a lot because sometimes when the goal is a little bit too granular or too ambitious, I feel like it's hard because the weight of the responsibility of achieving that can kind of sit on your shoulders.
[00:03:26.530] 我觉得主题设定确实很有帮助，因为有时候当目标过于细化或过于雄心勃勃时，我觉得会很难，因为实现目标的责任重担会压在你的肩上。
[00:03:41.690] But when something is a theme, I feel like it's way easier to kind of imbue that theme into different aspects of your life and just keep it in mind. Maybe when you're doing like decision making or things like that, but it's not, oh, I
[00:03:41.690] 但如果某件事成为一个主题，我觉得就更容易将这个主题融入到生活的各个方面，并时刻牢记在心。比如在做决定的时候，或者诸如此类的事情，但这并不是说，哦，我
[00:03:53.090] have to do this every single day. So, yeah, I can definitely appreciate that. It's kind of like in yoga when they try to make you set your intentions in the beginning of class. Yeah, true.
[00:03:53.090] 每天都得这么做。所以，是的，我完全能理解。这有点像瑜伽课上，他们会在课前让你设定目标。嗯，没错。
[00:04:04.890] But I really liked the way that you wanted to approach the New Year's resolutions this year. Personally, I thought it was a little bit funny because a couple of days before we had this chat, I had just gotten back and I was opening my new, you know, stationery
[00:04:04.890] 但我真的很喜欢你今年对待新年计划的方式。说实话，我觉得有点好笑，因为就在我们聊天前几天，我刚回来，正在打开我的新文具。
[00:04:20.850] that I got from Japan and writing down my little New Year's resolutions. Prior years, I think I've always set very specific goals. I think a common one is like, oh, this year I want to be more healthy or, you know, lose
[00:04:20.850] 我用从日本带回来的笔记本写下了我的新年愿望。往年，我好像都会设定非常具体的目标。常见的目标之一是，今年我想更健康，或者减肥。
[00:04:34.170] weight or this year I want to read more books, things like that. And those are things that I feel like I always try to do. And sometimes I achieve it, sometimes I don't.
[00:04:34.170] 比如减肥，或者今年我想多读些书，诸如此类。这些都是我一直努力想做的事情。有时候我能做到，有时候则不行。
[00:04:42.530] But it was just so much harder for me to like even think of those goals to write down this year. So I wrote down some of the most broad goals I've ever written down. And I would say that it's not even a goal.
[00:04:42.530] 但今年对我来说，想出并写下这些目标都难上加难。所以我写下了一些我写过的最宽泛的目标。而且我觉得，这甚至算不上一个目标。
[00:04:56.770] I almost approached it like a Taylor Swift era. Oh my God. Like 2024 is going to be the year of organizing, recalibrating and reflecting. And it will be the year of prioritizing my health and well-being. It'll be the year of love and joy.
[00:04:56.770] 我几乎把它当成了泰勒·斯威夫特的时代。我的天哪。感觉2024年将会是整理、调整和反思的一年。那一年我会优先考虑自己的健康和幸福。那一年将会是充满爱与快乐的一年。
[00:05:13.010] So I feel like it's things that I just want to focus on this year. And it's things that have existed in my life in prior years as well. But I think this year I want to focus on actually trying to improve certain aspects of my
[00:05:13.010] 所以我觉得今年我想专注于一些事情。这些事情过去几年也一直存在于我的生活中。但我认为今年我想专注于真正努力改善我的某些方面。
[00:05:27.450] life instead of just fighting for survival, because lowkey, 2023 was the year of survival for me. I mean, I feel like 2023 a lot was going on in your life, especially life itself is already a lot. And then you also had wedding planning on top of that.
[00:05:27.450] 与其说是为了生存而挣扎，不如说是为了生活而奋斗，因为说实话，2023年对我来说就是个挣扎求生的年份。我的意思是，我觉得2023年你的生活也经历了很多事，尤其是生活本身就已经够让人疲惫的了。而且你还要筹备婚礼。
[00:05:43.690] And then because like you have a lot of family who's not in California, that's like a whole extra layer of just like communications and like planning and all of that kind of stuff. So yeah, it's very understandable.
[00:05:43.690] 而且因为你有很多家人不在加州，这就意味着需要额外考虑沟通、计划等等方面的事情。所以，是的，这完全可以理解。
[00:05:57.730] I think it does make me very excited, too, because I mean, the wedding was just such a big focus of our year last year that I felt a little bit of guilt anytime we weren't doing wedding planning stuff.
[00:05:57.730] 我觉得这也让我非常兴奋，因为我的意思是，婚礼是我们去年一年的重心，所以每当我们没有在做婚礼筹备的事情时，我都会感到有点内疚。
[00:06:09.370] Like I would be like, oh, fuck, like there's all this stuff I have to do that's on our list. But we're here like hanging out with friends or doing whatever, which are equally important things.
[00:06:09.370] 比如我会想，哦，糟了，清单上还有好多事要做呢。但我们现在在这里，和朋友们一起玩或者做点别的，这些事同样重要。
[00:06:17.450] But just in the grand scheme of things, there was like a bigger worry that I had to think about all the time. But now it feels like the end, like the boss monster or whatever was defeated.
[00:06:17.450] 但从长远来看，我还有一件更让我担忧的事情要一直想着。不过现在感觉一切都结束了，就像最终的boss一样，什么的都被打败了。
[00:06:29.210] And now I can actually go and look at some of the smaller things in life that maybe need some work. So Casa has been a little messy. Like I've been putting off closet organization for a long time.
[00:06:29.210] 现在我终于可以去关注一下生活中一些需要改进的小事了。比如说，我家最近有点乱，像衣橱这种东西，我一直拖着没整理。
[00:06:40.490] And just in general, I want to set myself up for success before things are already happening. Like I don't want things to happen to me. I want myself to be able to make things happen.
[00:06:40.490] 总的来说，我希望在事情发生之前就为成功做好准备。我不希望事情被动地发生在我身上，而是希望自己能够主动创造机会。
[00:06:50.850] And hopefully this year there's a little bit more free headspace for me to do that. Oh, I like that. You don't want things to happen to you, but you want to make things happen. I feel like that's a really good mindset.
[00:06:50.850] 希望今年我能有更多空闲时间来做这件事。哦，我喜欢这种想法。你不想被动地等待事情发生，而是想主动创造机会。我觉得这是一种非常好的心态。
[00:07:02.770] I feel like what you have said just rings so true. Like a lot is happening in our lives. You know, we have work, we have social life, we have all these things that we're trying
[00:07:02.770] 我觉得你说的太对了。我们生活中确实发生了很多事。你知道，我们有工作，有社交生活，还有很多其他的事情要忙。
[00:07:12.930] to balance. And kind of like what you said, a lot of the times we're just fighting to survive. And so, yeah, like what happens is just that things happen to us and we just try to survive each wave.
[00:07:12.930] 为了保持平衡。就像你说的，很多时候我们只是为了生存而战。所以，是的，事情就是这样发生的，我们只能努力挺过每一波难关。
[00:07:25.130] Yeah. And I feel like it's one of those things where I wouldn't say in the moment last year, I felt like I was just trying to stay afloat. But I think looking back now, I can say that I was very stressed out last year and it
[00:07:25.130] 是的。我觉得去年那种事，当时我不会说出来，感觉自己只是在勉强维持。但现在回想起来，我可以说去年我压力很大，而且
[00:07:37.170] was affecting different parts of my life. Not like negatively, but I mean, it's more just like I was neglecting parts of my life that I feel like needed a little bit more attention.
[00:07:37.170] 这影响了我生活的方方面面。倒不是说有什么负面影响，我的意思是，我感觉自己忽略了生活中一些需要更多关注的部分。
[00:07:47.450] So now that all of this is over, I feel like it's just such a fresh slate for me to kind of work on. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So I guess that's like because it's so broad, it's also theme-like. Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:47.450] 现在这一切都结束了，我觉得就像是一张全新的画布，我可以重新开始。嗯，很有道理。我想，这大概是因为题材很广，所以也具有一定的主题性吧。没错。
[00:08:02.090] So along with the whole theme idea, there are like kind of goals attached to it. And then there are some goals that are just standalone goals. So I made like one very, very simple goal, which was I have this like old camera
[00:08:02.090] 所以，除了整个主题之外，还有一些与之相关的目标。当然，也有一些独立目标。我制定了一个非常非常简单的目标，那就是我有一台旧相机。
[00:08:16.970] lying around in my room and I've had it since freshman year of high school, I think. And I've been meaning to take it to a shop and see if it can be repaired. And it's literally been like over 10 years.
[00:08:16.970] 它一直放在我房间里，我想大概是从高中一年级开始就有了。我一直想把它拿到修理店看看能不能修好。这都过去十年多了。
[00:08:30.970] So I'm like, OK, this is the year I will finally do it. And I'm giving myself the entire year to be able to accomplish that goal. I'm giving myself the entire year to be able to accomplish this one task.
[00:08:30.970] 所以我就想，好吧，今年我一定要做到。我给自己一整年的时间来完成这个目标。我给自己一整年的时间来完成这项任务。
[00:08:43.850] Hopefully that's not too overwhelming and I'll be able to do it. Dude, that makes me laugh, honestly, because I have a very similar goal to that where it's like this one thing and I have 365 days minus 14 days to do it because we're recording this on the 14th.
[00:08:43.850] 希望这不会让我压力太大，我能做到。老兄，说真的，这让我觉得好笑，因为我的目标跟你很相似，就是这件事，我有365天的时间来完成，减去14天，因为我们是在14号录制节目。
[00:09:00.610] But I've been trying to read this Dostoevsky book called The Brothers Kermizov when I was a junior in high school. Oh, my God. So that's a lot. That's like 11 years ago, which is like similar time frame to your goal.
[00:09:00.610] 但我高二的时候就想读陀思妥耶夫斯基的《克米佐夫兄弟》。我的天哪。那可真是很久以前的事了。那已经是11年前的事了，跟你计划的时间差不多。
[00:09:12.930] Yeah. And every time I start it, I get like 100 or maybe 150 pages in around that point of the book. The like priest character gives a 50 page sermon like in the book. So every time I read it, I get to that point and I'm like, I can't do it.
[00:09:12.930] 是啊。每次我开始读这本书，读到大概100页或者150页左右，就会卡在那个地方。书里有个牧师角色，会发表一段长达50页的布道。所以每次读到那里，我就觉得，我读不下去了。
[00:09:29.890] And the book is fairly long. It's like eight hundred and fifty pages, maybe something like that. I'm like, OK, I have to read through 50 pages of this sermon and all the rest of the book. Like I just can't.
[00:09:29.890] 这本书挺长的，大概有八百五十页，可能差不多。我就想，好吧，我得读完这篇讲道的五十页，还要读完剩下的所有内容。我根本读不下去。
[00:09:39.570] But I think this year I'm finally going to tackle this and I will no longer be like, oh, I've been meaning to get around to it, but I'm going to do it sometime. Like this is the time that I will get around to it.
[00:09:39.570] 但我认为今年我终于要着手解决这个问题了，我不会再像以前那样，总是想着“哦，我一直想做这件事，但总有一天我会做的”。现在就是我完成这件事的时候了。
[00:09:52.930] OK, but like, is it bad if you just skipped the sermon? Like, is it important to the story? I guess like a normal person would probably just read like the synopsis or something. I think in my head, I was just like, oh, I need to like 100 percent
[00:09:52.930] 好吧，但是，如果直接跳过布道部分，会不会很糟糕？它对故事重要吗？我想正常人可能只会看看剧情梗概之类的。我当时的想法是，哦，我必须百分之百地……
[00:10:07.250] completion. You know, this book. Yeah. That's why I'm skimming. Yeah. OK, I believe you can do it, especially if you travel this year. I feel like in my experience, reading during traveling is very, very productive. Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:07.250] 完成。你知道，就是这本书。是啊。所以我才略读。嗯。好吧，我相信你能做到，尤其如果你今年要旅行的话。就我的经验而言，我觉得旅行时阅读效率非常高。是啊，没错。
[00:10:22.810] I guess I also mentioned I have some small goals tied to my theme. So as I mentioned, my theme is kind of rediscovering that like youth. I guess the way that I'm approaching it is I'm thinking back on things that I enjoyed doing when I was younger.
[00:10:22.810] 我想我也提到过，我有一些与主题相关的小目标。正如我所说，我的主题是重拾青春。我实现这个主题的方式是，回想我年轻时喜欢做的事情。
[00:10:40.290] So one example could be reading, watching movies, stuff like that. I'm just kind of like thinking back to these things that used to bring joy and kind of revisiting them. If it makes sense to if it's possible, if it still brings joy, then, you know,
[00:10:40.290] 举个例子，比如读书、看电影之类的。我只是想回忆一下那些曾经带给我快乐的事情，然后重新拾起它们。如果这样做有意义、可行，而且仍然能带来快乐，那么，你知道的，
[00:10:55.490] keep doing that. But if it no longer brings joy, then kind of just accept that and like move on. I like that. Do you think you'll have like a systematic approach to it or are you
[00:10:55.490] 继续做下去。但如果它不再带来快乐，那就接受现实，继续前进。我喜欢这样。你觉得你会采取一种系统性的方法吗？还是……
[00:11:06.050] just going to be like, oh, let's indulge in these things and just test things out as it comes? I think definitely more as it comes. So one thing I've already kind of started on it. So like one thing that I'm doing this year is I'm using a website
[00:11:06.050] 就抱着“哦，咱们就试试这些东西吧，到时候再摸索”的态度？我觉得肯定会更注重实践。我已经开始着手做一件事了。比如，我今年要做的一件事就是使用一个网站。
[00:11:22.850] to keep track of every single movie I watched this year. So then I think one thing is it'll be cool at the end of the year to look back and be like, oh, these are all the movies I watched this year.
[00:11:22.850] 我想记录下今年我看过的每一部电影。这样一来，我觉得年底回顾一下会很酷，我可以说，哦，这些都是我今年看过的电影。
[00:11:32.570] And like, what did I like and what did I not like? But also, I guess it's a more physical way of tracking like, oh, I'm doing this thing that I enjoy and I'm not forgetting about it, I guess. And then another thing is I've started reading.
[00:11:32.570] 比如，我喜欢什么，不喜欢什么？而且，我觉得这是一种更实际的记录方式，比如，哦，我在做我喜欢的事情，而且我没有忘记它。还有一件事，我开始阅读了。
[00:11:47.610] I picked up a book that I haven't read on my bookshelf and I just started reading it. Nice. There's definitely such a joy and almost like an incentive to like cataloging stuff that you've read or watched, because I feel like there's so much
[00:11:47.610] 我从书架上拿起一本还没读过的书，就开始读了。真不错。把读过或看过的东西整理出来，确实能带来很多乐趣，甚至会有一种动力，因为我觉得还有很多东西值得记录。
[00:12:02.050] satisfaction in marking something as like read or watched. So maybe that'll also be additional motivation for you to kind of keep up with the school too. And I guess like, I don't know. Do you feel like you get very reflective and thoughtful towards the end of the year?
[00:12:02.050] 把东西标记为已读或已观看会带来满足感。所以，这或许也能激励你继续跟上学校的进度。而且，我也不知道。你觉得到了学年末，你会变得特别善于反思和思考吗？
[00:12:18.770] I think yes, but when I travel, it's definitely a lot more subdued because I'm like, oh, you know, involved in the chaos of like traveling or exploring somewhere new. But I always have the urge to like sit down with a pen and paper and reflect on
[00:12:18.770] 我想是的，但旅行的时候，这种感觉会平静很多，因为我会沉浸在旅行或探索新地方的热闹氛围中。但我总是很想坐下来，拿笔和纸，好好反思一下。
[00:12:32.210] everything that has happened in the prior year. Yeah, I feel like I get really reflective too. So I think like cataloging some of the stuff that you've done over the year is really
[00:12:32.210] 回顾过去一年发生的一切。是的，我也很喜欢反思。所以我觉得把过去一年做过的事情记录下来真的很有意义。
[00:12:42.690] nice because when I get like, you know, kind of reflective and I'm like thinking back on the year, it's nice to have something physical to look at, whether it's like a list or I don't know, like journal entries or things like that.
[00:12:42.690] 这很好，因为当我反思过去一年的时候，能有一些实物可以参考，无论是清单，还是日记之类的东西，都会让人感觉很舒服。
[00:12:56.530] So I think that is another pro to the whole cataloging this stuff. Ooh, actually, that's a really good point. And it kind of reminds me of this conversation that I had over Christmas dinner this year. We were catching up with some of James's family friends.
[00:12:56.530] 所以我觉得这是整理这些东西的另一个好处。哦，确实，你说得很有道理。这让我想起了今年圣诞晚餐时和詹姆斯的一些家人朋友的一次谈话。
[00:13:13.370] We were trying to figure out two years ago on Christmas, did we grab dinner together or did we not? And it was kind of hard for us to remember exactly where the mom was two
[00:13:13.370] 我们一直在想两年前的圣诞节，我们到底有没有一起吃晚饭？而且我们很难确切地记得妈妈当时在哪里。
[00:13:22.770] years ago. The only thing that we found as like physical evidence of us eating dinner together two years prior was through a photo that she had taken. It wasn't a group photo or anything, but it was like a photo of some dessert that she
[00:13:22.770] 那是几年前的事了。我们找到的唯一能证明我们两年前一起吃过晚饭的实物证据，是她拍的一张照片。那不是一张合影之类的，而是一张她拍的甜点照片。
[00:13:37.090] had made. And then that triggered all of our memory to be like, oh, yeah, like I remember eating this dessert with you. Like, I totally remember this. And then that's when we were all like in agreement about what happened.
[00:13:37.090] 已经做好了。然后，这触发了我们所有人的记忆，就像，哦，对，我记得和你一起吃过这个甜点。就像，我完全记得。然后，我们就都对发生的事情达成了一致。
[00:13:48.850] But it made me think a lot, actually, because right now, you know, we're like 27 turning 28 this year. And already I was like kind of struggling remembering what happened two years ago. And it was something so random that ended up triggering our memory and not
[00:13:48.850] 但这件事确实让我思考了很多，因为你知道，我们现在都27岁了，今年快28岁了。我已经开始有点想不起来两年前发生的事了。而且，触发我们记忆的竟然是一件非常偶然的事情，而不是什么特别的事情。
[00:14:05.170] even like an exact record of what happened. And I feel like cataloging things like books and movies can actually help with that, because for me, when I look back on my Goodreads, I'm like, oh, I read this book during
[00:14:05.170] 甚至就像一份精确的事件记录。我觉得把书籍和电影之类的东西编入目录确实能起到这样的作用，因为对我来说，当我回顾我的 Goodreads 书单时，我会想，哦，我当时读过这本书
[00:14:16.170] like my sad era because this time of the year I remember reading this and thinking, oh, this is so relevant to me right now. Or like, oh, I remember reading this book and you know, so and so came over and we talked about it or things like that.
[00:14:16.170] 就像我那段悲伤的时期，因为每到这个时候，我就会想起读到这本书的时候，然后想，哦，这跟我现在的处境太贴切了。或者，就像，哦，我记得读过这本书，然后某某来我家，我们聊了聊这本书，诸如此类的事情。
[00:14:27.650] So sometimes our memories are just tied to all these things that you're cataloging for such a different reason, but it still triggers all these thoughts. Oh, my God. That is a really good point.
[00:14:27.650] 所以有时候，我们的记忆会和你出于完全不同的原因记录下来的这些东西联系在一起，但它们仍然会触发所有这些想法。我的天哪。这真是个好观点。
[00:14:37.930] Yeah, because I'm also making sure like when I am recording like the movies I watch or the books I read that I put like the date that I finished it. So, yeah, it'll be really interesting to see what gets tied to what, you know, what
[00:14:37.930] 是的，因为我也会记录我看过的电影或读过的书，比如我看的电影或读过的书，并记下看完的日期。所以，看看哪些事情会联系起来，真的很有意思。
[00:14:53.410] memory gets tied to what movie or book. I guess it's kind of like that thing where people say if you use a different perfume on like a trip, then it'll make it easier to remember.
[00:14:53.410] 记忆往往会与电影或书籍联系起来。我觉得这有点像人们常说的，如果你在旅行中使用不同的香水，就更容易记住旅行中的情景。
[00:15:05.410] Like next time you pick up that perfume, you're like, oh, this smells like my trip to Europe. Dude, yeah. And actually, it honestly made me want to take more photos as well, too, because I was
[00:15:05.410] 就像下次你拿起那款香水时，你会想，哦，这味道让我想起了我的欧洲之旅。哥们，没错。说真的，这也让我更想多拍些照片，因为我当时
[00:15:17.690] like, damn, I can't believe this is the only photo any of us had from that one Christmas dinner. I just feel like the older I get, the less I want things to like slip through my memory and I just want to like record everything.
[00:15:17.690] 天哪，真不敢相信这是我们所有人在那次圣诞晚餐上唯一拍的照片。我感觉年纪越大，就越不想让事情从记忆中溜走，只想把一切都记录下来。
[00:15:30.290] Maybe this is why parents always want to take like a billion photos of their kids. Oh my God, we are becoming the Asian parents. Oh God. So you also mentioned that your kind of broader goal slash theme this year is to
[00:15:30.290] 也许这就是为什么父母总是想给孩子拍无数张照片的原因吧。我的天哪，我们这是要变成亚洲父母了吗？我的天哪。你还提到，你今年的总体目标/主题是……
[00:15:44.570] get organized and I guess like cataloging kind of ties in with being organized. Do you have any other smaller goals tied to that? Yes, definitely. So I think one of the things that I wanted to really focus on this year was going more
[00:15:44.570] 整理收纳，我觉得像整理目录这种事也跟整理收纳息息相关。你还有其他相关的小目标吗？是的，当然。所以我觉得我今年想重点关注的事情之一就是……
[00:16:03.250] internal. So definitely the cataloging thing is a huge part of this because I want to record stuff, remember stuff, just make sure that I'm appreciating and celebrating like even the small victories in life, aka like finishing a book or watching a movie, but
[00:16:03.250] 内心深处。所以，整理记录绝对是其中非常重要的一部分，因为我想记录、记住各种事情，确保我能欣赏和庆祝生活中哪怕是小小的胜利，比如读完一本书或看完一部电影。
[00:16:19.610] also making sure that all of these like little obsessions or like eras that I have even throughout the year, I'm recording. So I made this page on my new journal and it's titled My Monthly Obsessions of 2024. Oh my God, I love that.
[00:16:19.610] 我还确保把一年中所有这些小小的痴迷或者某种时期都记录下来。所以我在新日记本上做了这一页，标题是“2024年我的每月痴迷”。天哪，我太喜欢这个名字了。
[00:16:35.970] Right. And I feel like it's vague enough to where like many things can be categorized as an obsession. Like sometimes I'll just listen to one song over and over or right now I'm in my Snoopy era. There's like this green puppet thing on TikTok I've been seeing everywhere.
[00:16:35.970] 对。我觉得“痴迷”这个词很模糊，很多东西都可以归类为痴迷。比如有时候我会反复听一首歌，或者像我现在这样，我正处于史努比时期。TikTok上有个绿色的玩偶，我到处都能看到。
[00:16:50.370] And that's like one of the cutest things I've ever seen. I'm also obsessed with that. Dude, that thing is actually it's from a Canadian kids show. So a lot of people on the comments of that are like, oh my God, I don't know what this
[00:16:50.370] 那简直是我见过最可爱的东西之一。我也超喜欢它。老兄，那东西其实是加拿大儿童节目里的。所以很多人在评论里都说，我的天哪，我不知道这是什么
[00:17:02.650] is, but like why do I relate so hard? And I was like, wait, I know what this is. Like I watched this when I was a kid. No way. I had no idea. Oh, so funny.
[00:17:02.650] 是啊，但为什么我这么有共鸣呢？然后我就想，等等，我知道这是什么。我小时候看过这个。不会吧。我完全不知道。哦，太搞笑了。
[00:17:13.450] But yeah, it's just all these things where I feel like I'm obsessed with something for like a week or like a month. And then I completely forget that I ever had that obsession because something new comes along and I just want to like jot that down somewhere.
[00:17:13.450] 是啊，就是那种感觉，我可能会对某件事着迷一个星期或者一个月。然后我又会完全忘记自己曾经痴迷过这件事，因为新的东西出现了，我就想把它记下来。
[00:17:27.810] Yeah, I think that's actually such a good idea because if anything, you can always go back and be like, oh, that's right. I was super obsessed with this. Like maybe I should revisit it or like, you know, see if there's any updates in that community or something.
[00:17:27.810] 对啊，我觉得这主意真不错，因为万一以后想起来，你可以随时回头看看，然后说：“哦，对，我之前特别迷这个。也许我应该重新看看，或者看看那个社区有没有什么更新什么的。”
[00:17:42.050] So it could be like a fun walk down memory lane in the future. Yeah, definitely. I guess the flip side of all of this cataloging stuff is I also just want to be a
[00:17:42.050] 所以，未来它可能会像一次有趣的怀旧之旅。是的，绝对是。我想，所有这些整理工作的另一面是，我也想成为一个……
[00:17:54.330] little bit more honest with myself and able to write down things in my journal that maybe 2023 me would not have wanted documented somewhere. But I saw this concept on TikTok. It was actually a concept about journaling where it said you should be able to do
[00:17:54.330] 我应该对自己更诚实一些，能够把一些事情写进日记里，而这些事情或许是2023年的我并不想记录下来的。但我是在TikTok上看到这个概念的。它实际上是一个关于写日记的概念，其中提到你应该能够……
[00:18:11.810] whatever you want in your journal, whether that's like get literal scraps of paper or whatever and like paste it in just because you like the aesthetic of it. Get like random receipts and paste that in if you don't want to write a whole thing out
[00:18:11.810] 你想在日记里写什么都行，比如随便找些纸片，或者其他什么东西，就因为喜欢这种风格就贴上去。或者随便找些收据贴上去，如果你不想写一整篇的话。
[00:18:23.210] about the restaurant that you ate at, things like that. And I was like, that makes total sense because who the fuck is reading this journal? Like literally no one except myself.
[00:18:23.210] 比如你去的那家餐厅之类的。我就想，这完全说得通，因为谁他妈会看这日记啊？除了我自己，根本没人会看。
[00:18:31.370] So I don't know why I'm like I have to upkeep this and in a perfect way and make this all like that. It's like it really doesn't matter. And I'm either going to read it like once a year or like once every five years or it's
[00:18:31.370] 所以我不知道为什么我总觉得我必须维护好这一切，而且要做到完美，让一切都井井有条。其实这一切真的无关紧要。我可能一年读一遍，也可能五年读一遍，或者……
[00:18:42.290] going to be like stashed in some closet box somewhere anyway. So this year I decided to abandon this mentality of like a perfect journal and like an emotional journal and just like be like a trash journaler, you know?
[00:18:42.290] 反正最后都会被塞到某个壁橱的箱子里。所以今年我决定放弃那种写完美日记、记录情感的心态，就当个随性随写的日记本，你懂的？
[00:18:56.290] I'm just imagining you making like the most perfect journal as if it's about to get published. Dude, pretty much. Yeah. And now you're like, wait, literally no one is reading this. I don't even have an editor. Like, okay. And here's like the most ridiculous thing.
[00:18:56.290] 我脑补了一下你写日记的场景，感觉就像要出版一样，完美得无可挑剔。哥们儿，差不多就是这样。是啊。然后你突然意识到，等等，根本没人看这个。我连个编辑都没有。好吧。接下来发生的事简直太荒唐了。
[00:19:12.610] So I bought a really nice journal years ago and I was like, oh my God, this is going to be like my daily journal. I'm so excited to write in it, etc., etc.
[00:19:12.610] 几年前我买了一本很漂亮的日记本，当时我就想，天哪，这将成为我的日常日记本。我太兴奋了，迫不及待地想在上面写东西等等。
[00:19:21.330] I was writing in it recently and I noticed I just hit like a little bit past the halfway mark. And this journal I bought in fucking 2016. And I think that's also a part of why I feel like these journals have so much weight and
[00:19:21.330] 我最近在写日记，发现已经写到一半多了。这本日记是我在2016年买的。我想这也是为什么我觉得这些日记本如此有分量的原因之一。
[00:19:34.170] permanence to it, because I've been working on one journal for eight years. So to move myself even further away from this seriousness and gravity of journaling, I bought like these 20 page journals basically or like 50 page journals. So it's like truly I have to swap it out mid-year anyway.
[00:19:34.170] 对我来说，这算是一种永久性的习惯，因为我已经用同一本日记写了八年了。为了让自己更远离写日记的严肃性和沉重感，我买了一些只有20页或者50页的日记本。所以，我其实每年都得换一本新的。
[00:19:51.610] Yeah. So I'm like, you know what? I'm not going to fall for the same bullshit that I always use to trick myself every year. This year I will fight back. Wait, that's such a good point. Okay. Have you ever finished a notebook? I don't think I have.
[00:19:51.610] 是啊。所以我就想，你知道吗？我不会再像往年那样上当受骗了。今年我要反击。等等，你说的太对了。好吧。你写完过笔记本吗？我想我没有。
[00:20:08.770] If I have, it's because I like forced it. But it's so hard. Like it's so rare, right? Yeah, I think there's maybe only like two or three times that I've ever like truly finished a notebook.
[00:20:08.770] 如果我做到了，那是因为我强迫自己去做。但这真的很难。就像很少见一样，对吧？是啊，我想我真正完成一本笔记本的次数可能只有两三次。
[00:20:20.770] Right. Which is so crazy to think because I am buying more than two or three journals like a year. The amount of pristine notebooks that I'm like, I'm like not ready to write in this. Yeah, it's too perfect right now.
[00:20:20.770] 对啊。想想都觉得不可思议，因为我一年买的笔记本不止两三本。那么多崭新的笔记本，我都觉得，我还没准备好用它们写字。是啊，现在它们太完美了。
[00:20:35.090] Yeah, I think it's like in years where maybe I'm a little bit more busy or like it's more chaotic. Like last year I was able to get by with like the same BS that I always feed myself. But this year I was like, you know what?
[00:20:35.090] 是啊，我觉得好像每年我都比较忙，或者事情比较混乱。比如去年，我还能靠着我一直以来给自己灌输的那些乱七八糟的想法勉强应付过去。但今年我就想，你知道吗？
[00:20:47.770] I'm not going to do this anymore. Let's just kind of do better and like just be better. And actually one of the eras that I've deemed 2024 as is I want this to be the year
[00:20:47.770] 我不想再这样下去了。我们应该做得更好，变得更好。事实上，我把2024年定为一个时代，我希望这一年能成为……之年
[00:21:00.130] of love and joy, which in some way I feel like it's a little ironic because last year I got married and had a wedding. And, you know, a lot of our friends, including you, spent certain days or like weeks
[00:21:00.130] 充满爱与喜悦，某种程度上我觉得这有点讽刺，因为去年我结婚了，办了婚礼。你知道，我们很多朋友，包括你，都花了几天甚至几周的时间庆祝。
[00:21:12.770] of the year, like really celebrating me and James' love and all of that, which is really great. But this year I want that love to come from me and go externally. So I was like, you know what? I want to reach out to friends more.
[00:21:12.770] 今年，我主要庆祝我和詹姆斯的爱情，这当然很棒。但今年，我希望这份爱能由我发自内心地传递给别人。所以我就想，不如多和朋友们联系吧。
[00:21:24.730] I want to be more of a proactive texter, which is something that I really struggle with. So just like these small things I feel like are easier to do. So that's one of the things that I have this year. Hmm, I like that.
[00:21:24.730] 我想更主动地发短信，这方面我一直很挣扎。所以我觉得像这样的小事更容易做到。这是我今年的目标之一。嗯，我喜欢这样。
[00:21:38.250] And hopefully this year there's like a lot more room for you to be able to do this. Yeah. I want to start like hosting stuff again. Maybe not as to the extent that I used to, but definitely like big holidays and stuff. I feel like is doable.
[00:21:38.250] 希望今年你有更多时间做这件事。是的，我想重新开始举办一些活动。也许不会像以前那样频繁，但肯定会举办一些大型节日活动之类的。我觉得这是可以做到的。
[00:21:52.490] So. Wow. How wholesome. We're so wholesome. I know. You know, I really like that era theme that you came up for yourself. And I think I have something that's kind of similar. So we haven't really talked about this on the podcast before, but I am currently in a
[00:21:52.490] 哇哦，真温馨。我们真是太温馨了。我知道。你知道吗，我真的很喜欢你给自己设定的那个时代主题。我觉得我也有点类似的想法。我们之前在播客里没怎么聊过这个，但我目前正处于……
[00:22:16.810] kind of newer relationship. And there's been a lot that I've learned from it already in like the short-ish time that it's been going on so far. And I feel like it's a focus that I would want to have in this new year to continuously
[00:22:16.810] 这是一种比较新的关系。虽然时间不长，但我已经从中学到了很多。我觉得在新的一年里，我会把重心放在这段关系上，并持续发展下去。
[00:22:37.850] improve and learn from it. It's so interesting because we're both in therapy. And we talk to our therapists about how we communicate with each other. And then they'll often give feedback or suggestions or just be like, you know, good
[00:22:37.850] 从中改进和学习。这很有意思，因为我们俩都在接受心理治疗。我们会和治疗师讨论我们彼此的沟通方式。然后他们通常会给出反馈或建议，或者只是简单地说，嗯，不错。
[00:22:56.450] job or whatever. Then what's funny is actually we will discuss it amongst ourselves. Like, oh, you know, this is something that I talked to my therapist about. Or like, you know, these are things that me and my therapist decided that I should work
[00:22:56.450] 工作什么的。然后有趣的是，我们实际上会私下讨论这件事。比如，哦，你知道，这是我跟我的心理咨询师谈过的事情。或者，你知道，这些是我和我的心理咨询师决定我应该去做的事情。
[00:23:10.050] on in the context of the relationship or even just other things. It's like very fascinating to see an action. And also there's a really funny side to this as well, which is I think his therapist likes
[00:23:10.050] 在这段关系中，或者在其他方面，这都非常有趣。观察这种行为真的很有意思。而且这件事还有个很有趣的地方，我觉得他的治疗师也喜欢这样。
[00:23:25.690] me. So I'm like, oh my God, this is like great because now I have two therapists to impress. Wait, yeah, you're right. Your therapy trait is to like always want to impress the therapist.
[00:23:25.690] 我。所以我就想，我的天哪，这太好了，因为现在我得给两个治疗师留下好印象了。等等，对，你说得对。你的治疗特质就是总是想给治疗师留下好印象。
[00:23:39.250] Yeah. So other than that, it's just like a lot to grow from even more than I realized before. I think before in previous relationships or just like not in relationships, I'm like, oh yeah, you know, like we're growing, we're learning here.
[00:23:39.250] 是的。除此之外，还有很多东西需要我去学习，比我之前意识到的还要多。我觉得以前在恋爱关系中，或者甚至在没有恋爱关系的时候，我都会想，哦，是的，你知道，就像我们都在成长，都在学习。
[00:23:57.130] But then now I'm like, whoa, this is like another I don't know, there's like another layer to it. And I feel like there's more nuance and then more like stuff that you can learn from just because it's like so I don't know, like interweave.
[00:23:57.130] 但现在我又觉得，哇，这好像还有另一层含义，我不知道该怎么说，感觉像是还有另一层含义。我觉得这里面有更多的细微差别，也有更多的东西可以从中学习，因为它就像是交织在一起的，我也不知道该怎么说。
[00:24:12.970] Wow. Well, I really love that. It's also kind of funny because it's kind of like couples therapy, except it's not. It's just like individual therapy and that you happen to talk about your relationship, which is just hilarious.
[00:24:12.970] 哇。嗯，我真的很喜欢这个。这也挺有意思的，因为它有点像情侣治疗，但又不是。它更像是个人治疗，只不过碰巧聊到了你们的感情关系，这真是太搞笑了。
[00:24:25.610] It's funny too sometimes because when me and my friend talk about it, I'm just imagining in my head like, wow, we get to talk about this stuff, but our therapists don't know each other. Like they're probably foaming at the mouth to talk to each
[00:24:25.610] 有时候也挺搞笑的，因为我和朋友聊起这件事的时候，我脑子里就会浮现出这样的画面：哇，我们居然能聊这些，但我们的心理咨询师彼此都不认识。感觉他们肯定都迫不及待地想跟对方聊聊了。
[00:24:42.290] other. Dude, they're probably all up on your social media. Like who is she dating? Yeah, that's that's really cool, though. And I'm also interested one day to like pick your brain on, I guess, relationships that you enter at a slightly older age.
[00:24:42.290] 其他的。哥们，他们可能都在你的社交媒体上呢。比如，她跟谁约会？是啊，那真的挺酷的。而且，我以后也想跟你聊聊，比如，年纪稍大一些的时候谈恋爱是什么感觉。
[00:25:01.490] So James and I started dating in college, and I feel like actually a lot of our friends either started dating in college or maybe towards a couple years after college or things like that. I just wonder if there's some sort of difference that you notice.
[00:25:01.490] 我和詹姆斯大学时开始交往，我觉得我们很多朋友要么大学时就开始谈恋爱，要么毕业几年后才开始。我只是想知道你有没有注意到什么不同之处。
[00:25:14.090] Maybe there's a little bit more like experience and learnings that you come to the table with for this kind of relationship. And I would have to think that it's like, I don't know, maybe different challenges, different rewards and all of that based on the age.
[00:25:14.090] 或许在这种关系中，你会积累更多的经验和感悟。而且我觉得，这可能和年龄有关，会带来不同的挑战、不同的回报等等。
[00:25:28.010] Oh my God, for sure. I have a lot to say. So stay tuned, I guess. But yeah, I really love that for you as a goal. I think also in terms of the bigger stages of life or like life at a bigger picture,
[00:25:28.010] 我的天哪，当然。我有很多话想说。所以，敬请期待吧。不过，我真的很喜欢你把这作为目标。我认为，从人生的更大阶段，或者说从更宏观的角度来看，
[00:25:44.770] even certain relationships can be different eras or at least start or end different eras of your life. So it'll be interesting to see how that expands further this year. Yeah, definitely. Speaking of relationships, I also feel like my brother and I or have been maybe even
[00:25:44.770] 甚至某些关系也可能代表不同的时代，或者至少是你人生不同阶段的开始或结束。所以，看看今年情况会如何发展，会很有意思。是的，当然。说到人际关系，我觉得我和我哥哥之间，或者说我们之间，可能一直……
[00:26:04.410] unintentionally building on our relationship in the past couple of years. I guess I have noticed that more recently and I feel like it's a good thing and I like the momentum that it's had.
[00:26:04.410] 过去几年，我们无意中加深了彼此的关系。我最近更注意到这一点，我觉得这是件好事，我很喜欢这种发展势头。
[00:26:19.090] So I'm like, oh, that's something to keep an eye on and hopefully continue to grow and try not to neglect. Oh, I love that. Sometimes it's like the people closest to us, I feel like that don't make the New Year's resolutions list or something.
[00:26:19.090] 所以我就想，哦，这值得关注，希望它能继续发展，不要忽视。哦，我喜欢这样。有时候，我觉得我们最亲近的人，反而不会被列入新年计划之类的。
[00:26:36.090] But yeah, definitely family is key too. I actually called my dad like a week ago and I've spoken on this podcast before that I like rarely just call him. I'll usually call my mom, she'll pass the phone over or something.
[00:26:36.090] 没错，家人当然也很重要。我大概一周前给我爸打了电话，之前在这个播客里我也说过，我很少直接给他打电话。我通常会打给我妈，然后她会把电话递给我什么的。
[00:26:49.930] But I called him and we chatted and a couple of days in Seoul, just him and myself and James got food and whatnot. And I was like, OK, I can keep working on this every year. I guess that's a goal for myself as well. Yeah.
[00:26:49.930] 但我给他打了电话，我们聊了聊，然后在首尔待了两天，就我们俩，还有詹姆斯一起吃饭什么的。我就想，好吧，我可以每年都这么做。我想这也是我的一个目标。是的。
[00:27:04.010] Oh, so is James in your New Year's goals or anything? Yes. Oh, really, Q? I think he's part of. OK, I would say he's part of the love and joy part. So I think because last year it was so much about like me and James banding together to
[00:27:04.010] 哦，所以詹姆斯在你的新年目标里吗？是的。哦，真的吗，Q？我觉得他是其中的一部分。好吧，应该说他是爱与快乐的一部分。因为去年我和詹姆斯在一起的时间太多了，所以我觉得……
[00:27:21.690] like bring people together for our wedding or things like that. It was very much like us against the world vibes. But now I feel like we can work on our world and he's very happy that I'm going to start like cleaning and like organizing the house this year.
[00:27:21.690] 比如把大家聚在一起参加我们的婚礼之类的。当时的感觉就像我们孤军奋战，与世界为敌。但现在我觉得我们可以好好经营我们自己的生活了，他也很高兴我今年要开始打扫和整理房子。
[00:27:37.810] So he's a part of two goals, the love and joy and also like the cleaning the house part. Wow. Well, how does it feel to enter the new year as a freshly married couple? So I think it's very different for me.
[00:27:37.810] 所以他参与了两个目标：爱情和快乐，以及打扫房子之类的家务。哇。那么，作为一对新婚夫妇迎接新年是什么感觉呢？我觉得对我来说非常不一样。
[00:27:53.770] I actually feel like being married is completely different. And, you know, last year I think it was really just myself and maybe like one other of our friends who was engaged. But this year I think a lot more of my friends are getting engaged.
[00:27:53.770] 我觉得结婚和恋爱完全不一样。你知道，去年好像只有我和另一个朋友订婚了。但今年我觉得订婚的朋友就多了很多。
[00:28:08.970] And I was actually hanging out with one of my really close friends yesterday. She was saying that it pretty much feels the same for her, except for maybe like a couple of small details.
[00:28:08.970] 昨天我和一个非常要好的朋友一起出去玩。她说她感觉也差不多，可能只有一些小细节有所不同。
[00:28:18.130] But for me, I felt like every stage, like getting engaged, getting married, like felt so worlds different. I was kind of like, well, I really guess it is dependent on like how emotional or how
[00:28:18.130] 但对我来说，我觉得每个阶段，比如订婚、结婚，都感觉截然不同。我当时想，嗯，我想这真的取决于情绪有多激动，或者……
[00:28:29.410] sensitive or like how you choose to see these things like love and marriage and whatnot. Yeah. I think now that I'm a married woman, I do feel like I have to act a little bit differently.
[00:28:29.410] 敏感与否，或者说你如何看待爱情、婚姻等等这些事情，都取决于你自己的选择。是的。我觉得现在我结婚了，我的行为方式确实需要有所改变。
[00:28:41.690] I'm like, maybe I should stop being so immature and like crazy all the time. No, that's OK. No, that's OK. You can keep doing that. Wait, I saw the funniest meme. It was like this Hello Kitty all tucked into bed, very happy looking with like a giant
[00:28:41.690] 我心想，也许我应该别再这么幼稚、这么疯狂了。不，没关系。不，没关系。你可以继续这样。等等，我看到一个超搞笑的表情包。就是一只Hello Kitty舒舒服服地躺在床上，看起来很开心，旁边还有个巨大的……
[00:28:59.930] water bottle next to it and a book in its hand. And it was like me after being insane all day. Wait, that's literally me. But yeah, I think I have mentioned on this podcast before that I tend to like structure.
[00:28:59.930] 旁边放着水瓶，手里拿着一本书。这简直就像我疯了一天之后的样子。等等，这不就是我吗？不过，我之前在这个播客里好像也说过，我喜欢有条理的生活。
[00:29:15.050] I like clearly defined roles and things like that. And I feel like now that I have this role of a wife, I feel like I have like bigger shoes to fill. So I'm excited to see if I'm able to be the sort of wife that younger me would
[00:29:15.050] 我喜欢角色分明之类的。现在我有了妻子这个角色，感觉肩负的责任更大了。所以我很期待看看自己能不能成为年轻时的自己心目中的那种妻子。
[00:29:30.130] have wanted. Just work on things in a different way. I don't know. Like I don't want to feel so old. Not to say that married people are old, but I do feel a little bit older than I'm married. Maybe the right word is mature. OK, yeah, you're right.
[00:29:30.130] 一直都想这样。只是换个方式做事。我不知道。比如，我不想觉得自己那么老。倒不是说已婚人士就老，但我的确觉得自己比实际年龄要老一些。也许用“成熟”这个词更合适。好吧，你说得对。
[00:29:45.330] I have to stop thinking I'm old. I need to be like, I'm mature now. But yeah, I think it's been really fun. And, you know, every moment feels more special now that I can be like, oh my God, this is
[00:29:45.330] 我得停止觉得自己老了。我得告诉自己，我现在成熟了。不过，我觉得这段时间真的很有趣。而且，你知道，现在我可以对自己说，天哪，这真是……，所以每一刻都显得更加特别。
[00:29:55.330] our first time doing whatever as a married couple. So it's been a lot of many celebrations. Yeah. Aww. That's nice to hear. You're finding a lot of joy in being married. And even though I guess base level or like on the surface, not much has really changed.
[00:29:55.330] 这是我们婚后第一次一起做这件事。所以有很多值得庆祝的事情。是啊。哇，真好。你们在婚姻中找到了很多快乐。虽然我觉得从根本上来说，或者说表面上，并没有发生太大的变化。
[00:30:11.570] But it's kind of like you're both doubling down, like, OK, now I need to like do even more to fill up this role and be the best that I can and continue to like mature and learn together. Yeah, definitely.
[00:30:11.570] 但感觉就像你们俩都在加倍努力，好像在说：“好吧，现在我需要付出更多才能胜任这个角色，做到最好，并继续成长和学习。” 是的，绝对是这样。
[00:30:27.210] And it is a little bit interesting to see what kind of advice I get from family now, too. So when I was in Korea, I felt like I got a lot of like, OK, now that you're married, let me tell you about pregnancy kind of advice.
[00:30:27.210] 现在从家人那里得到的建议也挺有意思的。我在韩国的时候，感觉他们给我的建议大多是那种“好了，既然你结婚了，那我就跟你说说怀孕的事”之类的。
[00:30:43.570] And I think actually since I've been like, you know, looking forward to pregnancy, not like immediately, but just it's like a part of my future life plans already. It wasn't like overbearing or anything.
[00:30:43.570] 其实我觉得，自从我开始期待怀孕以来，虽然不是马上就期待，但它已经成为我未来生活计划的一部分了。这并不是一种压力或者焦虑。
[00:30:55.850] But, you know, sometimes I just forget that these older women in our life have gone through what we will or might go through already. And they have all these like words of wisdom or life advice that they just choose not
[00:30:55.850] 但是，你知道，有时候我会忘记，我们生命中这些年长的女性已经经历过我们将会或可能经历的事情了。她们有很多人生智慧或建议，只是她们选择不分享。
[00:31:08.490] to share with us because maybe we're not ready. Right. So on some ways, I was like, actually, I really appreciate that, that they waited for these things until after I was married where I can kind of absorb and understand this information more.
[00:31:08.490] 他们跟我们分享这些，是因为也许我们还没准备好。没错。所以在某种程度上，我其实很感激他们这样做，等到我结婚后，我才能更好地消化和理解这些信息。
[00:31:22.170] And on the other hand, I was just like, wow, I can't believe you guys went through all of this stuff. And I just had no idea. Wow. It's like the doors have been opened for you.
[00:31:22.170] 另一方面，我当时就想，哇，真不敢相信你们经历了这么多。我完全不知道。哇。感觉就像机会之门为你们敞开了一样。
[00:31:31.930] You get to see the other side of all this stuff that we don't know. Yeah. And low key, I feel like now that I'm married, I have more access to like grown up tea because they were spilling some tea now that I'm married.
[00:31:31.930] 你可以看到我们所不知道的另一面。是啊。而且说实话，我觉得我现在结婚了，更容易听到一些成年人的八卦，因为他们现在都开始跟我说一些内幕消息了。
[00:31:44.410] And I was like, holy shit. Yeah, that's true, actually, because now they're probably like, oh, they're like adults now. You know, they're married. They know what we go through and they know things that we know.
[00:31:44.410] 我当时就想，我的天哪。是啊，确实如此，因为他们现在可能觉得，哦，他们现在都成年了。你知道，他们结婚了。他们知道我们经历的一切，他们也知道我们知道的事情。
[00:31:57.290] Exactly. It's like easier for them to see you as somewhat of an equal. Yeah, that was kind of exciting as well. I was like, wow, this is like grown up wives gossip. Yeah. Wife tea. Wow, that's exciting.
[00:31:57.290] 没错。这样他们更容易把你当成平等的一员。是啊，这也挺让人兴奋的。我当时就想，哇，这简直就是成年太太们的八卦。对，太太茶。哇，真让人兴奋。
[00:32:12.970] Do you feel like you're getting invited more to like dinners and stuff? But it's like your family, friend, parents? I think a little bit. And it's kind of funny because I feel like the other people who also get invited to these
[00:32:12.970] 你是不是感觉自己最近被邀请参加聚餐之类的活动更多了？但都是家人、朋友、父母之类的？我觉得有点儿。而且挺有意思的，因为我觉得其他也被邀请参加这些活动的人……
[00:32:25.290] things are like other married couples as well. So I'm just like, oh, my God. Now I can't be like, oh, which of the kids are coming? Because it's really just like the married couples. Oh, my God.
[00:32:25.290] 情况和其他已婚夫妇一样。所以我就想，我的天哪。现在我没法问，哦，哪个孩子会来？因为真的就跟其他已婚夫妇一样。我的天哪。
[00:32:36.530] I remember there was this one really funny comment someone made in our group chat. It was like a few days after your wedding and you and James went out to get dinner with like a couple of close family friends, except it was just the like parents.
[00:32:36.530] 我记得我们群聊里有人说过一句特别搞笑的话。大概是你婚礼几天后，你和詹姆斯跟几个关系比较好的家人朋友出去吃饭，结果来的只有父母之类的。
[00:32:49.130] Right. And then someone was like, wow, what a cute triple date. Like just three married couples having a wonderful dinner together. Dude. Yeah, it's a little bit wild being invited to these things.
[00:32:49.130] 对。然后有人说，哇，好可爱的三人约会啊。就像三对已婚夫妇一起享用一顿美好的晚餐。哥们儿，是啊，被邀请参加这种活动确实有点儿不可思议。
[00:33:02.570] And I think it'll take some getting used to because I still feel like such a child. But the wedding band on my finger says otherwise, maybe. So I should probably grow up a little bit.
[00:33:02.570] 我想我还需要一段时间来适应，因为我感觉自己仍然像个孩子。不过，我手指上的结婚戒指或许说明了并非如此。所以，我可能真的应该成熟一些。
[00:33:12.810] Or or you can just tuck it away in the safe and and live your happiest childlike life. That's true. You know, jokes aside about, I guess, the married life. Throwing a wedding last year did really make me reflect on the concept of like
[00:33:12.810] 或者，你也可以把它藏在保险箱里，过上最快乐的童年生活。没错。你知道，先不说关于婚姻生活的玩笑。去年办婚礼确实让我反思了一下“婚姻”这个概念。
[00:33:28.650] celebrating stuff, which I know is very vague. But it obviously took us a lot of time and effort and honestly money to throw something so big. But it was so crazy seeing all these people that we've met and known at
[00:33:28.650] 庆祝各种事情，我知道这说法很笼统。但很明显，举办这么盛大的活动耗费了我们大量的时间、精力和金钱。看到所有我们认识和遇到的人齐聚一堂，感觉真的太不可思议了。
[00:33:43.370] different ages of our life coming together to like help celebrate us and just have fun with us and enjoy the food and wine and whatnot. And it made me think there's actually a lot of things that are worth celebrating in
[00:33:43.370] 不同年龄段的人聚在一起，为我们庆祝，和我们一起享受美食美酒，其乐融融。这让我意识到，生活中其实有很多值得庆祝的事情。
[00:33:55.570] life, not just marriage, that we don't end up doing these big celebrations for. Like a common one I feel like we do is birthdays. But sometimes people are like, oh, I don't really want to do something crazy or whatever, which is definitely fair.
[00:33:55.570] 生活中，不仅仅是婚姻，还有很多事情我们最终不会大张旗鼓地庆祝。比如生日，我觉得我们通常会庆祝。但有时候人们会说，哦，我其实不想搞什么疯狂的庆祝活动之类的，这当然可以理解。
[00:34:08.650] But I kind of felt like to the extent that I can, I want to continue having fun celebrations and nights of appreciation for people and not just wait for like weddings and then like, that's it. You know what I mean? Yeah.
[00:34:08.650] 但我感觉，只要我还能做到，我就想继续举办各种有趣的庆祝活动和感恩之夜，而不是只等到婚礼之类的场合，然后就结束了。你明白我的意思吗？嗯。
[00:34:23.890] You know, there's so much joy that can be shared. Not that you always have to throw a huge party for it, but maybe in the day to day, we don't put in the effort or like forget to carve out time for these things.
[00:34:23.890] 你知道，生活中有很多快乐是可以分享的。当然，你不一定非要为此举办盛大的派对，但也许在日常生活中，我们没有投入精力，或者忘记抽出时间来做这些事情。
[00:34:36.290] And it's like joy and love that could be celebrated more. Yeah. I don't know if that made any sense. No, it makes total sense. And I'm so glad you brought that up because I actually saw this TikTok recently
[00:34:36.290] 就像喜悦和爱，应该得到更多赞美。是啊。我不知道我这么说你能不能理解。不，完全说得通。我很高兴你提到了这一点，因为我最近也看到了这个TikTok视频。
[00:34:47.770] that kind of made me think along similar lines as what you just said. It was basically someone hosting like a, I don't even know what to call it, like a binge-a-thon for like singles inferno. Oh.
[00:34:47.770] 这让我想到跟你刚才说的差不多的事情。基本上就是有人组织了一场，我都不知道该怎么形容，有点像单身人士的狂欢派对。哦。
[00:34:59.850] And I was like, dude, this is like something that is honestly really easy and can be really intimate for, you know, a friend group, you know, just have a bunch of snacks, tell everyone to bring their own snacks and then just like sit down and watch a
[00:34:59.850] 我当时就想，哥们儿，这其实很简单，而且对一群朋友来说也很温馨，你知道，只要准备一些零食，让每个人都带自己的零食，然后坐下来一起看……
[00:35:13.570] bunch of, you know, shitty reality TV that makes everyone laugh and have a good time. And I was like, wow, that's such a good vibe. And it's definitely something that I thought like, oh, this is very doable for us.
[00:35:13.570] 你知道，就是那种很烂的真人秀，但能让每个人都开怀大笑，玩得开心。我当时就想，哇，这氛围真好。我当时就觉得，哦，这对我们来说完全可行。
[00:35:25.530] Maybe it's something that I can think about doing more in the new year as well. Just like not everything has to be super big and sometimes the smaller, easier. Oh my God. I'm about to use some corporate word like low-hanging fruit.
[00:35:25.530] 也许我可以考虑在新的一年里多做些这方面的事。就像不是所有事都必须做得特别大，有时候小事反而更容易。我的天哪，我差点就用上“唾手可得”这种商业术语了。
[00:35:39.770] It's just like it sometimes it really reaps a lot of benefits. Yeah. And people celebrate like the funniest shit. Like I saw on TikTok someone threw a funeral for their boobs because they were getting a boob job. So it was like RIP whoever's old boobs.
[00:35:39.770] 有时候就是这样，真的能带来很多好处。是啊。而且人们庆祝的方式也特别搞笑。比如我在TikTok上看到有人因为要做隆胸手术，就给自己的胸部办了个葬礼。就好像在说“安息吧，逝去的胸部”。
[00:35:56.770] And I was like, this is so funny. And it honestly is kind of a big event in life to get like a boob job. And, you know, I feel like there's been things in our friend group even that have been
[00:35:56.770] 我当时就想，这太搞笑了。说实话，隆胸手术确实是人生中的一件大事。而且，你知道，我觉得我们朋友圈里也发生过一些类似的事情。
[00:36:06.810] bigger things that we maybe just didn't have the time or like energy to celebrate. So I feel like big or small, we can always use some sort of excuse to have these gatherings. So I'm excited for, you know, more friendship connections, more celebrations of
[00:36:06.810] 一些我们可能没时间或没精力庆祝的大事。所以我觉得，无论大小，我们总能找到一些理由来举办这些聚会。因此，我很期待，你知道，能有更多友谊的联结，更多庆祝活动……
[00:36:22.250] whatever and just more fun nights in the new year. Agreed. Well, now that we feel all warm and fuzzy, let's wrap up and get excited for the new year. So thank you everyone for listening to us and embarking on this new year with us.
