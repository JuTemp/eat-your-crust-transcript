[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Jane. And I'm Cindy.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Jane。我是Cindy。
[00:00:17.840]  All right we have an interesting Gen Z word today. The word is kind of originating from gaming
[00:00:17.840] 好的，今天我们要介绍一个有趣的Z世代词汇。这个词起源于游戏领域。
[00:00:26.560]  actually but I have noticed recently that it's being used more in like TikTok or just outside of
[00:00:26.560] 实际上，但我最近注意到它在TikTok之类的平台上使用得更多，或者说在其他地方也越来越多。
[00:00:33.440]  gaming slash Twitch community. But I've also noticed that like maybe a lot of young kids are on Twitch
[00:00:33.440] 游戏/Twitch社区。但我同时也注意到，可能有很多年轻人也在使用Twitch。
[00:00:40.240]  and or like watching streams lately because I think a lot of these newer slang words are coming from
[00:00:40.240] 最近我经常看直播，因为我觉得很多新俚语都来源于此。
[00:00:47.760]  streams and just like the interesting meme culture of Twitch. So the word that we're
[00:00:47.760] 直播，还有Twitch上有趣的梗文化。所以我们说的是……
[00:00:54.640]  going to discuss today is bot. Like robot, bot. Like B-O-T. Yes, B-O-T. This word is used to describe
[00:00:54.640] 今天我们要讨论的是机器人（bot）。就像机器人（robot），机器人（bot）。就像 B-O-T。是的，B-O-T。这个词是用来描述……
[00:01:05.040]  someone as dumb basically. It's almost like calling someone an MPC because in a lot of games
[00:01:05.040] 基本上就是说某人很蠢。这就像在很多游戏中把某人称为MPC一样。
[00:01:14.000]  they kind of put you through simple tutorial game where you play against literal AI bots. So this
[00:01:14.000] 他们会安排一个简单的教学游戏，让你和真正的AI机器人对战。所以这
[00:01:20.480]  is kind of where the word originates from because these AI bots are not meant to be very good. So
[00:01:20.480] 这个词大概就是由此而来，因为这些人工智能机器人原本的设计目标就不是很好。
[00:01:27.440]  sometimes people just call each other bots. Oh you're so bad, you're playing like a bot wood.
[00:01:27.440] 有时候人们会互相称呼对方为机器人。哦，你打得太烂了，简直像个机器人。
[00:01:33.840]  I remember when I was first learning to play League in high school there were definitely those
[00:01:33.840] 我记得我高中刚开始学玩英雄联盟的时候，确实有那么几个这样的玩家。
[00:01:38.480]  AI bots that are built into the game but I think there's also people who bought their normal
[00:01:38.480] 游戏内置了AI机器人，但我认为也有人购买了普通AI机器人。
[00:01:44.640]  accounts or something like that. So then sometimes you would see someone play and then
[00:01:44.640] 账号之类的东西。所以有时候你会看到有人在玩游戏，然后
[00:01:49.600]  their character would literally just run into the enemy Nexus and just like immediately die
[00:01:49.600] 他们的角色会直接冲进敌方枢纽，然后立刻死亡。
[00:01:53.840]  and then all the comments would be like okay this guy's a bot or something. So then this word
[00:01:53.840] 然后所有评论都会说，好吧，这家伙是个机器人之类的。所以，这个词
[00:01:58.240]  reminds me of those days where you would just see people do like completely nonsensical things in
[00:01:58.240] 这让我想起了那些日子，你会看到人们做一些完全没有意义的事情。
[00:02:02.320]  games. Low key sometimes I feel like you see that shit in real life too. Sometimes people
[00:02:02.320] 游戏。说实话，有时候我觉得现实生活中也能看到这种事。有时候人们
[00:02:07.040]  are just bots and you're like why are you acting like this? Okay but this makes me think
[00:02:07.040] 他们都只是机器人，你会想，你们为什么这样？好吧，但这让我想到……
[00:02:11.920]  of the smart bots like I feel like there's a scale. In chess there's like chess bots
[00:02:11.920] 我觉得智能机器人之间存在一个等级。就像国际象棋中也有国际象棋机器人一样。
[00:02:15.840]  right that people can't beat. So are you like a dumb bot or a smart bot? Intermediate or advanced bot?
[00:02:15.840] 没错，这是人类无法战胜的。所以你是像个笨机器人还是个聪明机器人？中级机器人还是高级机器人？
[00:02:24.880]  It's like are you NPC or bot? I think that's really classified. So NPC is worse. No I think
[00:02:24.880] 这就像你是NPC还是机器人？我觉得这算是机密。所以NPC更糟糕。不，我觉得
[00:02:31.200]  bots are probably worse. Sometimes how I think of it is like a bot doesn't have a real brain
[00:02:31.200] 机器人可能更糟糕。有时候我觉得机器人就像没有真正的大脑一样。
[00:02:37.040]  so that's kind of the insult behind it like oh you don't have a human brain. Because at
[00:02:37.040] 所以这其实是一种侮辱，就好像在说“哦，你没有人类的大脑”。因为在
[00:02:42.000]  least NPCs they have like the phrases right where they say like oh do you want an apple?
[00:02:42.000] 最少的NPC，比如他们会说“哦，你想要个苹果吗？”之类的短语。
[00:02:47.680]  That's true like NPCs at least have personalities. Exactly but bots don't.
[00:02:47.680] 没错，至少NPC还有个性。确实如此，但机器人没有。
[00:02:54.560]  Yeah I think this is a very versatile word actually. I can see a lot of applications
[00:02:54.560] 是的，我觉得这个词的用途非常广泛。我想到了很多应用场景。
[00:02:59.280]  of this in real life and it's interesting to me because there's also a Gen Z slang word that
[00:02:59.280] 现实生活中也存在这种情况，我觉得很有意思，因为还有一个Z世代俚语……
[00:03:04.800]  I've been seeing on TikTok which is bop and I think that one's also negative and that one
[00:03:04.800] 我在TikTok上看到一些很棒的视频，我觉得那一个也是负面的，还有那个。
[00:03:09.520]  is probably it means a little bit more like this person is promiscuous or like this person has
[00:03:09.520] 这可能意味着这个人比较放荡，或者这个人有……
[00:03:16.160]  sexual intentions or something like that but the words are so similar. So every time I read it
[00:03:16.160] 可能是性暗示之类的，但这些词太相似了。所以每次我读到它
[00:03:20.400]  I'm like okay is this bop or bot and then I have to like sort it in my brain. We're like BOP? Yeah BOP.
[00:03:20.400] 我当时就想，好吧，这是BOP还是机器人？然后我得在脑子里把它们区分开来。我们就像BOP？对，是BOP。
[00:03:26.640]  Wait doesn't that mean a sick ass song in R? Yeah right that's a bop. That's exactly what came
[00:03:26.640] 等等，那岂不是说一首超赞的R调歌曲？对啊，那首歌超好听。没错，就是这样。
[00:03:34.000]  Your millennial is showing. Nooo. Damn they've free to find our words.
[00:03:34.000] 你家千禧一代的毛病暴露了。不！他们居然能把我们的话都说出来。
[00:03:43.760]  Now it means something bad that's crazy. How can it even mean that? I actually have no idea
[00:03:43.760] 现在它有了个很糟糕的、很离谱的意思。怎么会是这个意思呢？我真的不知道。
[00:03:49.600]  but I see it and it always makes me frown a little bit because I didn't like when people were
[00:03:49.600] 但我看到它总是让我有点不高兴，因为我不喜欢人们那样做。
[00:03:55.520]  called certain words when we were growing up and now I feel like the Gen Z kids are going
[00:03:55.520] 我们小时候经常听到一些词，现在我觉得Z世代的孩子们正在逐渐改变这些词的含义。
[00:03:59.920]  through their own iteration of it so I would much prefer bot than bop although both are.
[00:03:59.920] 通过他们自己的迭代，所以我更喜欢 bot 而不是 bop，尽管两者都是。
[00:04:07.120]  Dude if some Gen Z person called me a bop I would be like wow thanks that sounds like such a good
[00:04:07.120] 哥们儿，要是有哪个Z世代的人夸我牛逼，我肯定会说：哇，谢谢，听起来真不错！
[00:04:12.880]  word. Like you're a bop. Yeah it's like a compliment. You'll be like thanks.
[00:04:12.880] 就像你很棒一样。对，这就像是一种赞美。你会说谢谢。
[00:04:19.040]  Amazing. I am a sick ass bop. I am a bop. Oh my god you know what I also found out
[00:04:19.040] 太棒了。我简直酷毙了。我太牛逼了。我的天哪，你知道我还发现了什么吗？
[00:04:25.120]  last night that kids are saying so one of the words that we had on the podcast last year was
[00:04:25.120] 昨晚孩子们都在说，去年我们在播客里提到的一个词是……
[00:04:31.520]  eight like if you did something really well then like you ate so sometimes kids say what's four
[00:04:31.520] 八，就像如果你做得特别好，比如你吃了东西，所以有时候孩子们会问四是什么。
[00:04:37.280]  plus four. I've seen that on Instagram comments. That's because like four plus four. So that means
[00:04:37.280] 加四。我在 Instagram 评论里看到过。那是因为四加四。所以这意味着
[00:04:44.400]  like sick or no. It kind of means like you did so well like you ate it kind of. Yeah. Oh my
[00:04:44.400] 不管生病与否。这有点像是在说你做得很好，就像你把它吃光了一样。是的。哦，我的天哪
[00:04:52.880]  god I thought so. Does that mean it's sick? Does that mean it's hella dope? No. It's four plus four.
[00:04:52.880] 天哪，我就知道。那是不是意味着它很棒？那是不是意味着它超级酷？不，它只是四加四而已。
[00:05:03.840]  Dude they do stuff like if it's like just below eight it's like that's seven.
[00:05:03.840] 兄弟，他们会做一些奇怪的事情，比如如果实际温度略低于八度，他们就算作七度。
[00:05:10.560]  You're almost eight. You're almost seven. She was so close. Oh my god but it was really
[00:05:10.560] 你快八岁了。你快七岁了。她就差一点儿。我的天哪，但那真的
[00:05:21.600]  funny because when I first saw that four plus four I was like eight out of ten like and then I was like
[00:05:21.600] 真搞笑，因为我第一次看到四加四的时候，我觉得它值八分（满分十分），然后我就觉得
[00:05:28.240]  oh eight I see. I feel like those moments are so humbling when I see something and I have to like
[00:05:28.240] 哦，八，我明白了。我觉得当我看到某些东西时，那种感觉真的让人感到谦卑，我不得不喜欢它。
[00:05:34.160]  google it I'm like oh my god I'm so old. Hey but at least we can keep up just barely but we're
[00:05:34.160] 谷歌一下，我心想：我的天哪，我好老啊。嘿，但至少我们还能勉强跟上，但我们……
[00:05:40.720]  keeping up. That's true now we know what bop means and bop. Well through our Gen Z slang
[00:05:40.720] 跟上时代。没错，现在我们知道了“bop”是什么意思，也知道了“bop”是什么意思。嗯，通过我们Z世代的俚语。
[00:05:48.960]  section you may already find that these voices sound familiar to you. So both Jane and Cindy
[00:05:48.960] 在这一部分，你可能已经发现这些声音听起来很熟悉。简和辛迪都是如此。
[00:05:54.880]  have been on the podcast before and Jane has joined us on episode 168 where she talks about her
[00:05:54.880] 之前她也上过我们的播客节目，简在第168期节目中和我们一起聊了聊她的故事。
[00:06:00.320]  masters in arts education and how that funneled her into the world of consulting. And Cindy joined
[00:06:00.320] 她获得了艺术教育硕士学位，并由此进入了咨询行业。辛迪也加入了
[00:06:06.240]  us back in episode 194 where we dove deep into group chat dynamics. We're actually super excited
[00:06:06.240] 在第194集中，我们深入探讨了群聊动态，这让我们感到非常兴奋。
[00:06:13.040]  for this topic today because one it was a topic that our listener asked us to cover. And two I feel
[00:06:13.040] 今天之所以选择这个话题，一是因为我们听众要求我们讨论这个话题，二是我觉得
[00:06:21.040]  like it's just one of those topics where there's so much ambiguity in the term so I'm excited to
[00:06:21.040] 因为这就像是一个定义非常模糊的话题，所以我很兴奋。
[00:06:25.920]  have both Jane and Cindy on today to talk about situations. Very excited because I love girl talk.
[00:06:25.920] 今天简和辛迪都来了，她们要聊聊各种事情。我特别兴奋，因为我喜欢听女生聊天。
[00:06:34.080]  Yeah it's been a while since we've done our last girl talk so very excited to get into this
[00:06:34.080] 是的，我们已经很久没有进行女生间的谈话了，所以非常兴奋能再次开始这次谈话。
[00:06:39.280]  one. So let's kick this off by diving into the meaning behind the term. So what is a situation
[00:06:39.280] 一、那么我们先来深入探讨一下这个术语的含义。那么，什么是这种情况呢？
[00:06:45.920]  ship to you and how is it different from the terms dating or a fling or an FWB? I thought about this
[00:06:45.920] 对你来说，这种关系和约会、一夜情或炮友关系有什么区别？我一直在思考这个问题。
[00:06:54.400]  and I think it's hard to have like a clear definition but the way I think about it if you
[00:06:54.400] 我觉得很难给它一个清晰的定义，但我的想法是，如果你
[00:06:59.520]  had more than three dates with someone but it's not official so the situation shifts
[00:06:59.520] 和某人约会超过三次，但关系还没有正式确定，所以情况发生了变化。
[00:07:07.120]  because just if you the first two dates because then you're like you don't really care about this
[00:07:07.120] 因为如果你只约会了两次，那你就会觉得你根本不在乎这件事。
[00:07:12.880]  but then as it goes to like three because I never had just three days it's always like
[00:07:12.880] 但后来就变成三天了，因为我从来没有只待过三天，所以总是这样。
[00:07:18.320]  one or two or like three plus so I think at that point it becomes a situation ship.
[00:07:18.320] 一两个，或者三个以上，所以我觉得到了那个时候，它就变成了一艘情境船。
[00:07:25.200]  I think yeah I agree it's kind of like a no commitment romantic relationship so
[00:07:25.200] 我觉得是的，我同意，这有点像一种没有承诺的恋爱关系。
[00:07:31.680]  you're basically dating but there's no labels there's not really any next steps because I feel
[00:07:31.680] 你们基本上是在约会，但没有确定关系，也没有下一步的打算，因为我觉得
[00:07:37.520]  like maybe the conversation haven't gone there yet and you're basically kind of like in a limbo
[00:07:37.520] 就像对话还没说到那一步，你基本上处于一种进退两难的境地。
[00:07:43.440]  I guess not a relationship but not dating either. So maybe it's like the step before you become
[00:07:43.440] 我想这不算恋爱关系，但也算不上约会。所以，也许这就像是成为恋人之前的过渡阶段。
[00:07:50.000]  exclusive? Yes depends depends if you get there. Do you think you can be in an exclusive
[00:07:50.000] 独家？嗯，这取决于你是否能做到。你认为你能成为独家吗？
[00:07:57.680]  situation ship? I think so but it really depends on if you guys are on the same page about stuff.
[00:07:57.680] 算是情侣关系吗？我觉得是，但这真的取决于你们在一些事情上的想法是否一致。
[00:08:04.080]  Yeah my first thought was yes and then I thought about it again I was like I don't know.
[00:08:04.080] 是的，我第一反应是“是”，但后来我又想了想，觉得“我不知道”。
[00:08:09.440]  That's how much of a limbo it is like in a situation ship you don't know.
[00:08:09.440] 这就是身处未知境地时的那种迷茫感。
[00:08:13.520]  Yeah I think because in my mind I've pictured situations shifts as just the more confused you
[00:08:13.520] 是的，我想是因为在我脑海里，我把情况的变化想象成你越来越困惑。
[00:08:20.160]  are the more likely you're probably in a situation ship there's just not a lot of things
[00:08:20.160] 你越有可能陷入困境，你可能就身处一艘没有多少东西的船上。
[00:08:25.280]  being defined. I actually agree with that because my personal theory behind this word is
[00:08:25.280] 被定义。我其实同意这一点，因为我对这个词的个人理论是……
[00:08:32.080]  I feel like there's a certain connotation to the word situation ship because I do believe that you
[00:08:32.080] 我觉得“关系船”这个词有某种特定的含义，因为我确实相信你
[00:08:37.040]  can go on multiple dates with people or a specific person and you guys could just be like casually
[00:08:37.040] 可以和不同的人约会多次，也可以和特定的人约会，你们的关系可以很随意。
[00:08:43.040]  dating but I feel like with specifically the term situation ship it almost feels like one long
[00:08:43.040] 约会，但我觉得用“关系型CP”这个词，感觉就像是一段漫长的恋情。
[00:08:50.080]  term thing maybe slightly more long term and two somewhere where you purposely don't define it.
[00:08:50.080] 期限可能稍微长一些，还有一种情况是你故意不去定义它。
[00:08:55.840]  So it's not like oh we haven't defined it yet it's more like we're not defining it for a specific
[00:08:55.840] 所以，并不是说我们还没有定义它，而是说我们还没有针对特定情况来定义它。
[00:09:00.160]  reason so do you guys think this kind of tracks with what you're thinking or do you feel like
[00:09:00.160] 所以你们觉得这和你们的想法一致吗？或者你们觉得……
[00:09:04.640]  it's less negative for you? Well it's definitely not defined it's like the pre what are we
[00:09:04.640] 对你来说负面影响没那么大？嗯，这肯定没有明确的定义，就像我们是什么的前提一样。
[00:09:10.240]  conversation because no one says like what are we oh we're a situation ship. Fair.
[00:09:10.240] 因为没人会说“我们是什么关系”，所以就没法展开对话。哦，我们是一对情侣。这很公平。
[00:09:15.440]  True. At that point you have to decide so it's the pre but it could be kind of like what you were
[00:09:15.440] 没错。到那时你就得做决定了，所以这是前期准备阶段，但可能有点像你之前的情况。
[00:09:20.720]  saying maybe people are purposely avoiding that conversation or it's like that conversation hasn't
[00:09:20.720] 也许人们是在故意回避这个话题，或者说，这个话题根本就没被讨论过。
[00:09:25.840]  happened yet. But I've also heard like people who are in six or seven months situation ships
[00:09:25.840] 还没发生。但我听说有些人在船上待了六七个月。
[00:09:31.760]  and I feel like at that point it's like you guys should talk about it. Maybe they're just
[00:09:31.760] 我觉得到了那个时候，你们应该谈谈这件事。也许他们只是
[00:09:37.520]  both non-confrontational. True I think I have a friend they were like in a year long thing
[00:09:37.520] 两人都不喜欢冲突。确实，我觉得我有个朋友，他们之间好像持续了一年之久。
[00:09:43.920]  I was like no. Wait are you dating or no you're not oh that's a real situation ship for sure.
[00:09:43.920] 我当时就想，不，等等，你们是在交往还是没交往？哦，这绝对是一段真实的恋情啊。
[00:09:51.920]  You know what maybe a situation ship is just a fling that has gone on for too long.
[00:09:51.920] 你知道吗，也许所谓的“暧昧关系”只是一段持续太久的露水情缘。
[00:09:57.600]  Like an expired fling. Yeah yeah I could see that because one of the terms that I floated
[00:09:57.600] 就像一段过气的恋情。是啊，我能理解，因为我之前提到的一个说法是……
[00:10:04.160]  in the like definition was FWB and I feel like FWB is a little bit more defined it's just
[00:10:04.160] 在类似的定义中，FWB（炮友）这个词，我觉得FWB的定义更明确一些，它只是
[00:10:09.680]  the benefits basically but I feel like a situation ship is similar as a fling where you're like seeing
[00:10:09.680] 好处显而易见，但我感觉这种“暧昧关系”有点像一夜情，就像你看到……
[00:10:15.680]  each other consistently but it's still up in the air on what exactly you are. You know what I think
[00:10:15.680] 你们一直都互相喜欢，但你们到底是什么关系仍然悬而未决。你知道我的想法吗？
[00:10:22.640]  I have a theory that you can change FWB into a situation ship but only on your side if you
[00:10:22.640] 我有个理论，你可以把炮友关系变成恋人关系，但前提是你得站在你这边。
[00:10:30.480]  catch feelings. Oh yeah not a mutual. It could be mutual but it's like a situation ship for you
[00:10:30.480] 动真情了。哦，对，不是双向的。也许是双向的，但对你来说就像是暧昧关系。
[00:10:39.680]  because you don't know what to do next. Oh I see I see yeah that could happen. Maybe situation ship is
[00:10:39.680] 因为你不知道下一步该怎么做。哦，我明白了，是的，这种情况可能会发生。也许情况就是这样。
[00:10:46.560]  more one person versus like two person if that makes sense like it's a situation ship for you
[00:10:46.560] 更像是单人模式而不是双人模式，如果这么说你能理解的话，就像是你们的“情境船”一样。
[00:10:54.400]  because you don't know where you stand because you haven't talked to the other person or maybe
[00:10:54.400] 因为你不知道自己的立场，因为你没有和对方谈过，或者也许
[00:11:00.960]  like it's a situation ship for the other person because they don't know where they stand
[00:11:00.960] 对对方来说，这就像是一段暧昧关系，因为他们不知道自己处于什么位置。
[00:11:04.720]  because like you two haven't talked. Wait there wouldn't it still be situation ship for both? I guess
[00:11:04.720] 因为你们俩好像都没说过话。等等，那对你们俩来说不还是“暧昧关系”吗？我猜是吧。
[00:11:10.400]  like yes technically but I think if you are on the end where you're like oh no like to me this is
[00:11:10.400] 理论上是的，但我觉得如果你到了最后那种“哦不”的地步，对我来说，这就是
[00:11:17.440]  just say like friends with benefits or something but then the other person is like you know they've
[00:11:17.440] 就说是炮友之类的关系，但对方会说你知道他们已经……
[00:11:22.560]  caught feelings they're like oh my god what do I do this is a situation now kind of
[00:11:22.560] 动了真情，他们会想：我的天哪，我该怎么办？现在情况有点复杂。
[00:11:28.320]  I think there are times where people will be like oh I like you but I'm not ready
[00:11:28.320] 我觉得有时候人们会说，哦，我喜欢你，但我还没准备好。
[00:11:33.200]  for us to be in a relationship so then it becomes a situation ship where you're like oh okay I guess
[00:11:33.200] 如果我们真的在一起，那这段关系就变成了一种暧昧关系，你会觉得，哦，好吧，我猜
[00:11:38.960]  we'll just stay it's like I like what we have now you know yeah it's like one of those situations
[00:11:38.960] 我们就待在这里吧，我喜欢我们现在拥有的一切，你知道吗？嗯，就像那种情况一样。
[00:11:44.960]  and then that's why I take a situation ship. True I've had friends that were really devastated
[00:11:44.960] 所以这就是我选择接受这种变通方案的原因。的确，我有些朋友为此感到非常沮丧。
[00:11:50.320]  after like a situation ship breakup sometimes even more so than the relationship breakup.
[00:11:50.320] 就像船体破裂一样，有时甚至比恋爱关系破裂更让人感到痛苦。
[00:11:55.840]  I wonder why that is because I guess logically you would think oh relationships usually tend
[00:11:55.840] 我很好奇这是为什么，因为从逻辑上讲，你会认为哦，人际关系通常倾向于
[00:12:00.880]  to be longer it's more official maybe you mesh more into each other's lives etc etc but I have also
[00:12:00.880] 时间越长，关系就越正式，你们或许能更深入地融入彼此的生活等等，但我也有过这样的经历。
[00:12:06.560]  heard similar things like that where the situation ship ending can be a little bit more brutal or
[00:12:06.560] 也听说过类似的事情，比如船的结局可能会更残酷一些。
[00:12:12.400]  I guess specifically it can be harder to recover from so what is it about a situation ship
[00:12:12.400] 我想具体来说，这种情况可能更难恢复，那么，这种情况下的船究竟有什么特别之处呢？
[00:12:18.000]  that's maybe sometimes harder to let go or like get over? I would assume it's like even if it's
[00:12:18.000] 也许有时候更难放下或者克服？我猜即使是这样……
[00:12:24.560]  short it could be really intense so that could be a reason why it's harder because it can be
[00:12:24.560] 短时间内可能会非常激烈，所以这可能是它更难的原因之一，因为它可能……
[00:12:30.080]  like a short but very intense type of relationship maybe because it's so intense it doesn't really
[00:12:30.080] 就像一段短暂但非常激烈的感情，或许正因为如此，它才显得不那么重要。
[00:12:35.520]  work out as a relationship either. I think maybe it's also the untapped potential because you never
[00:12:35.520] 这段关系也发展不下去。我觉得也许还在于尚未开发的潜力，因为你从来没有……
[00:12:42.480]  reached a relationship. Yeah you kind of get caught on that what if oh what if it could have worked
[00:12:42.480] 曾经有过一段感情。是啊，你很容易陷入那种“如果……会怎样”的幻想，如果当初我们能走到一起就好了。
[00:12:48.160]  stuff like that but then with a real relationship you already go through everything so by the end
[00:12:48.160] 诸如此类的事情，但真正的恋爱关系中，你已经经历了这一切，所以到最后……
[00:12:53.040]  of it you're like oh of course it's not working out because we try to end it and work out
[00:12:53.040] 你会想，哦，当然不会成功，因为我们试图结束这段关系并努力维系。
[00:12:57.120]  versus the situation ship there's a we didn't really try it so now I'm going back and forth
[00:12:57.120] 相比之下，目前的情况是，我们并没有真正尝试过，所以现在我来回摇摆不定。
[00:13:02.640]  wondering oh should I have tried or not and then it becomes more I guess devastating as what people
[00:13:02.640] 我开始犹豫要不要尝试，然后这种想法变得更加令人沮丧，就像人们……
[00:13:08.000]  would say. Yeah like the unknowing aspect. And I think to Jane's point it's probably a little
[00:13:08.000] 会这么说。是啊，就像那种未知感。而且我觉得简说的也有点……
[00:13:14.320]  toxic too because you don't you know like you're constantly confused maybe anxiety written
[00:13:14.320] 这也有毒，因为你不知道，你知道，你总是感到困惑，也许是焦虑。
[00:13:21.440]  thinking about what's gonna happen or like what to do next so then the highs are highs and
[00:13:21.440] 想着接下来会发生什么，或者下一步该做什么，这样高潮就只是高潮而已。
[00:13:26.640]  the lows are low. Yeah I think I keep going back to what Cindy described earlier where she said that
[00:13:26.640] 低谷真的很低。是啊，我总觉得我之前辛迪描述的那样，她说……
[00:13:32.240]  situationships can sometimes feel like you're in limbo because relationships have clearly defined
[00:13:32.240] 暧昧关系有时会让人感觉像是在进退两难，因为恋爱关系已经有了明确的定义。
[00:13:37.600]  expectations it's like you're expected to talk through these things with your SO and you're
[00:13:37.600] 期望值好像是应该让你和你的伴侣讨论这些事情，而你却……
[00:13:42.080]  expected to work on things together and have healthy communication but realistically in a
[00:13:42.080] 期望能够共同协作并保持良好的沟通，但现实情况是……
[00:13:47.520]  situation ship you're not really expected to do any of those things even if it feels like
[00:13:47.520] 情况是这样的，即使你感觉自己需要做这些事，但实际上你并不需要做任何这些事。
[00:13:52.560]  you should so then I feel like maybe if you're constantly wavering back and forth or if the other
[00:13:52.560] 你应该这样做，所以我觉得，如果你一直在犹豫不决，或者如果其他方面……
[00:13:57.520]  person isn't fulfilling certain needs that you would expect from someone who's say an SO I feel
[00:13:57.520] 我觉得这个人没有满足我作为伴侣应有的某些需求。
[00:14:02.720]  like that would leave me with way more questions than like answers when something ends. Yeah that's
[00:14:02.720] 这样的话，事情结束后只会给我留下更多疑问，而不是答案。是啊，就是这样。
[00:14:08.880]  probably why honestly their most situationships are probably toxic and unhealthy. Yeah the limbo
[00:14:08.880] 可能这就是为什么他们的大多数暧昧关系都有毒且不健康的原因吧。是啊，这种进退两难的境地。
[00:14:16.960]  the non-communication. Dude the non-communication okay I have a theory you know kdramas like before
[00:14:16.960] 缺乏沟通。老兄，缺乏沟通，好吧，我有个理论，你知道韩剧以前就是这样。
[00:14:25.360]  the happy ending there's always like the build up and then they like break up before really being
[00:14:25.360] 美好的结局总是有铺垫，然后他们在真正在一起之前就分手了。
[00:14:30.720]  together and then they like get back together and everything's happy that beginning part that first
[00:14:30.720] 他们在一起，然后又复合了，一切都很美好，这就是最初的那部分。
[00:14:35.920]  arc is all just situationship. Dude true it's like potentially like a slow burn but like a toxic
[00:14:35.920] 这段关系完全就是暧昧关系。兄弟，确实，它可能像慢热型的，但又像是有毒的关系。
[00:14:42.800]  slow burn. You're like why don't you two just talk to each other? So like are all relationships at
[00:14:42.800] 慢热型关系。你会想，你们俩为什么不直接沟通呢？所以，所有的关系都是这样吗？
[00:14:48.960]  some point in the beginning situationships? See to me I wouldn't classify it like that
[00:14:48.960] 一开始算是暧昧关系吗？我觉得不能这么归类。
[00:14:55.360]  and maybe this is just because I'm drawing from just my personal experiences right but I feel
[00:14:55.360] 也许这只是因为我只是根据自己的个人经历来描述，但我感觉
[00:15:00.560]  like I would almost classify a situation ship as there's no progress you're like stuck in
[00:15:00.560] 我几乎会把这种“困境船”归类为“毫无进展，你就像被困住了一样”。
[00:15:06.720]  no man's land where it's not going forward and it's not going backwards but if you're
[00:15:06.720] 一片不进不退的无人区，如果你是
[00:15:10.880]  talking to someone and it's not yet defined but there's still forward moving progress you feel
[00:15:10.880] 和别人谈过之后，虽然还没有最终确定，但你仍然能感觉到在向前推进。
[00:15:15.840]  like after a couple months will probably be in a different spot or something like that
[00:15:15.840] 比如几个月后，可能就会换个地方之类的。
[00:15:19.920]  then I would still classify that as like dating and not necessarily a situation ship because
[00:15:19.920] 那我仍然会把它归类为约会，而不是一段暧昧关系，因为
[00:15:25.040]  you're not stuck in a situation. No I agree because I feel like in a situation ship there's
[00:15:25.040] 你并没有陷入困境。不，我同意，因为我觉得在困境中，总会有……
[00:15:30.160]  no trajectory where you go from like dating and exclusive and then being finally in a
[00:15:30.160] 没有那种从约会、恋爱到最终结婚的固定模式。
[00:15:35.760]  relationship you're just stuck in this like situation aka becomes a situation ship. Yeah I
[00:15:35.760] 你们的关系就像陷入了某种困境，变成了一种“情境船”。是的，我
[00:15:43.040]  think I can agree with that too. I think the main factor is that someone has to avoid answering
[00:15:43.040] 我也同意这一点。我认为主要原因是有人必须回避回答。
[00:15:51.200]  questions and then things quickly turn into a situation ship. It only takes one.
[00:15:51.200] 问题接踵而至，事情很快就会演变成一场危机。只需要一个问题就够了。
[00:15:57.920]  I wonder if like we asked guys the same question if they would define it the same way.
[00:15:57.920] 我想知道，如果我们问男性同样的问题，他们的定义是否也会一样。
[00:16:02.800]  Yeah I can totally see guys having a different perspective about this because the way I see
[00:16:02.800] 是的，我完全能理解男生对此有不同的看法，因为在我看来……
[00:16:09.440]  situations ships there's something preventing it from being a real relationship. I think like
[00:16:09.440] 有些情况下，似乎有什么东西阻碍了一段真正的关系发展。我觉得就像……
[00:16:15.360]  Crystal said communication that's blocked on one side would definitely be a factor but is there
[00:16:15.360] 克丽丝特尔说，一方沟通受阻肯定会是一个因素，但是否存在这种情况呢？
[00:16:20.640]  anything else you think that can sometimes block a situation ship from funneling into a
[00:16:20.640] 还有什么其他因素可能会阻碍一艘船驶入预定航道？
[00:16:26.160]  relationship? Commitment issues. Wait does that mean if you're in a situation ship that's like
[00:16:26.160] 恋爱关系？承诺问题。等等，那是不是意味着如果你处于一段类似“恋爱关系”的处境中，就像……
[00:16:32.800]  doomed to fail or are there ways to get out of that bucket? Okay maybe you know if you can get
[00:16:32.800] 注定失败吗？还是有办法摆脱这种困境？好吧，也许你知道，如果你能……
[00:16:40.400]  out of the friend zone maybe you can get out of the situation zone. That's true never lose hope.
[00:16:40.400] 走出友谊区，或许你就能摆脱困境。没错，永远不要失去希望。
[00:16:45.600]  So what would be those things maybe? Communicating like what you want from the beginning because
[00:16:45.600] 那么，这些事情可能是什么呢？从一开始就沟通好你的需求，因为
[00:16:52.160]  then if you're like also confused and of course it becomes like a confusing situation but if you're
[00:16:52.160] 如果你也感到困惑，当然，这会变成一种令人困惑的情况，但如果你是
[00:16:58.720]  like oh I do want a relationship then in the beginning you should just be upfront about it and
[00:16:58.720] 如果你确实想要一段感情，那么一开始你就应该坦诚相告。
[00:17:03.120]  be like oh I would want to see this become a relationship and then if the guy is like not
[00:17:03.120] 就像，哦，我希望看到这段关系发展下去，但如果男方说“不”，那就另当别论了。
[00:17:07.840]  about it then you should leave because he's not gonna meet your needs. Yeah save that mental energy.
[00:17:07.840] 如果你觉得他无法满足你的需求，那就应该离开。省省精力吧。
[00:17:14.800]  Exactly. I feel like another thing that comes to mind is pride and I feel like I can kind of
[00:17:14.800] 没错。我觉得还有一点值得一提，那就是自豪感，我觉得我好像可以……
[00:17:22.400]  go like many different ways. One is if someone is so prideful that they don't want to be the one to
[00:17:22.400] 有很多不同的方法。其中一种是，如果有人非常骄傲，他们不想成为第一个……
[00:17:27.120]  be like oh I actually really like you I want this to become bigger or the other way could be like
[00:17:27.120] 比如，就像“哦，我真的很喜欢你，我希望我们之间的关系能发展得更好”；或者反过来，就像……
[00:17:33.760]  if you are you know really into this guy maybe investing a lot into him but you're giving up
[00:17:33.760] 如果你真的很喜欢这个人，可能在他身上投入了很多，但你却放弃了。
[00:17:40.160]  part of yourself to like continue to stay in the situation ship. I feel like there's different
[00:17:40.160] 你的一部分自我会想要继续留在这种境地中。我觉得这不一样。
[00:17:44.800]  sides of the pride spectrum that can kind of feed into the situation ship continuing.
[00:17:44.800] 骄傲光谱的两端可能会对局势的持续发展产生影响。
[00:17:50.160]  I also wonder if like people make that decision quickly this person is the situation ship
[00:17:50.160] 我也想知道，如果像其他人一样迅速做出决定，这个人是不是就属于这种情况。
[00:17:56.240]  relationship or this person is dating. Oh maybe it's if they can't make that decision quickly
[00:17:56.240] 是恋爱关系还是正在约会？哦，也许是因为他们无法迅速做出决定。
[00:18:04.320]  like oh I still don't know. Like can't make that decision quick enough. Yeah like if this person
[00:18:04.320] 哦，我还是不知道。感觉没办法尽快做决定。是啊，就像如果这个人
[00:18:09.600]  is relationship material or if I'm ready for a relationship okay maybe if like you personally
[00:18:09.600] 我是否适合谈恋爱？或者我是否准备好谈恋爱？好吧，也许如果你个人喜欢我的话。
[00:18:18.000]  feel like it's wrong timing or something that could prevent a relationship too and then
[00:18:18.000] 感觉时机不对，或者有什么事可能会阻碍这段感情，然后
[00:18:23.840]  cause the situation ship. I agree timing is also a big factor I feel like timing and compatibility
[00:18:23.840] 因为情况就是这样。我同意时机也是一个重要因素，我觉得时机和兼容性都很重要。
[00:18:29.600]  and also if you're like on the same life path it's hard to get all of it to work out sometimes
[00:18:29.600] 而且，如果你们的人生道路相同，有时也很难让所有事情都如愿以偿。
[00:18:36.800]  and then it just becomes a situation ship if you don't really see a future too. Oh my god
[00:18:36.800] 如果你看不到未来，那它就只是一段权宜之计了。我的天哪
[00:18:41.600]  do you guys know the show slash book slash movie one day? Yes. No. Okay well I think one day is a
[00:18:41.600] 你们知道《有一天》这部剧/书/电影吗？知道。不知道。好吧，我觉得《有一天》是一部……
[00:18:51.440]  situation ship. Yes a very long one. The gist of the story is these two best friends they kind of
[00:18:51.440] 情况有点复杂。是的，很长一段。故事梗概是这样的：这两个好朋友有点……
[00:18:59.120]  develop feelings for each other but then they only see each other like one day every year or
[00:18:59.120] 他们彼此产生了感情，但却只能每年见一次面。
[00:19:04.000]  something. Oh yeah that's a situation ship. It's like a 10 year one right or like 20 years. Yeah
[00:19:04.000] 什么事。哦，对，那是个长期关系。大概持续10年或者20年吧。嗯。
[00:19:12.560]  like something super long so is it kind of like they're probably like really compatible
[00:19:12.560] 就像某种超长的东西，所以它们可能真的非常契合。
[00:19:17.440]  they like each other but then timing wise it just doesn't make sense. Yeah and then they kind
[00:19:17.440] 他们互相喜欢，但从时机上看，这根本不合适。是啊，然后他们就……
[00:19:22.560]  of like see other people in between because you know they don't really see each other all
[00:19:22.560] 就像看到其他人一样，因为你知道他们其实并不经常见面。
[00:19:28.480]  that often and they never like define their relationship and they don't really tell each
[00:19:28.480] 他们经常这样做，但他们从不喜欢定义彼此的关系，也从不真正告诉对方。
[00:19:33.760]  other either throughout many points they kind of just like sweep it under the rug. They're like well
[00:19:33.760] 其他方面，他们很多时候都像是把问题掩盖起来一样。他们就像……
[00:19:39.520]  this is my life now. I remember you have the movie before sunrise do you know that one? I have
[00:19:39.520] 这就是我现在的生活。我记得你有一部叫《爱在黎明破晓前》的电影，你看过吗？我有
[00:19:47.520]  not watched it but I've heard of it. These two people meet while traveling and they like have
[00:19:47.520] 我没看过，但听说过。这两个人在旅行中相遇，他们似乎……
[00:19:52.800]  this awesome date together but then they're just traveling so they like meet for like 24 hours
[00:19:52.800] 他们本来约会很棒，但后来他们就出差旅行了，所以只能见面24小时左右。
[00:19:57.600]  and then they go to their respective homes and then they meet again like 10 years later
[00:19:57.600] 然后他们各自回家，大约十年后再次相遇。
[00:20:02.160]  in a different film. Oh wait what? In a different film? So the first it's like a three film series.
[00:20:02.160] 在另一部电影里。哦等等，什么？在另一部电影里？所以第一部好像是三部曲系列电影。
[00:20:11.360]  The first movie is about their first time meeting and then I think they film the next one like
[00:20:11.360] 第一部电影讲的是他们第一次见面，然后我觉得他们拍了下一部，就像这样。
[00:20:15.920]  five ten years later like their second time meeting and then a couple years later the third
[00:20:15.920] 五年后，也就是他们第二次见面的时候，又过了几年，第三次见面了。
[00:20:20.320]  time so they're like actually older. That's like a right person wrong time situation ship.
[00:20:20.320] 时间久了，他们实际上年纪都比我大了。这就像是“对的人错时”的典型例子。
[00:20:27.840]  Do we believe in that? I think maybe for the most situations I think it's
[00:20:27.840] 我们真的相信吗？我觉得在大多数情况下，我认为是的。
[00:20:35.520]  overcomable but I think there's definitely moments where maybe it really is kind of just like
[00:20:35.520] 虽然可以克服，但我认为肯定有些时候，情况可能真的就像……
[00:20:42.720]  wrong time. Yeah I feel like I don't really believe in it because if the saying is right
[00:20:42.720] 时机不对。是啊，我觉得我不太相信这话，因为如果这话是对的，
[00:20:47.280]  person wrong time then why would it be the right they can't be the right person if it's
[00:20:47.280] 如果这个人选错了时间，那为什么会是合适的人选呢？如果真是这样，那他不可能是正确的人选。
[00:20:52.160]  the wrong time. Yeah exactly exactly I guess I kind of feel like there's probably a handful of
[00:20:52.160] 时机不对。是啊，没错，没错。我觉得可能只有少数几个人……
[00:20:58.480]  people who are like right enough you know like they're right but like just enough and then there's
[00:20:58.480] 有些人，你知道，他们说的没错，但也就仅此而已，然后还有一种人……
[00:21:04.960]  probably like the person who's actually like really right maybe not just one person but
[00:21:04.960] 可能就像那个真正说得对的人，也许不止一个人，但
[00:21:10.160]  less people than the right enough people. Jesus playing a game of probability. Like 90 90%
[00:21:10.160] 人数少于合适的人选。耶稣在玩概率游戏。比如90%
[00:21:17.600]  right versus the 95% right. No I agree that makes sense because there's probably a right person
[00:21:17.600] 正确与95%正确之间的区别。是的，我同意这很有道理，因为很可能存在一个完全正确的人。
[00:21:24.800]  for every time. Oh my god true I like that. That actually makes sense as we kind of discuss these
[00:21:24.800] 每次都是这样。哦，我的天，确实如此，我喜欢这个说法。这确实很有道理，因为我们一直在讨论这些问题。
[00:21:33.680]  things though I am kind of changing my mind a little bit on what situation ship means because
[00:21:33.680] 不过，我对“船”这个概念的看法正在稍微改变，因为
[00:21:39.200]  I think we talked a lot about like some of the negative aspects of a situation ship but it does
[00:21:39.200] 我认为我们谈了很多关于这种处境不利的方面，但它确实
[00:21:45.120]  kind of feel like something can only really qualify as a situation ship versus a fling if there's some
[00:21:45.120] 感觉只有当某种关系中存在某些因素时，才能真正称之为“情境式恋爱”而不是“露水情缘”。
[00:21:50.400]  sort of more potential there so whether it's the right person wrong time or maybe your expectations
[00:21:50.400] 那边似乎还有更大的发展潜力，所以可能是人对了，但时机不对，或者只是你的期望值过高。
[00:21:55.840]  just don't align but it's like slightly more serious than a fling so I'm curious on what you
[00:21:55.840] 虽然不太合拍，但感觉比随便玩玩要认真一些，所以我很好奇你的想法。
[00:22:03.440]  guys think are like the pros and cons of a situation ship versus a real relationship
[00:22:03.440] 男生们会思考，这就像“暧昧关系”和“真正恋爱关系”的利弊权衡一样。
[00:22:09.440]  or versus something more casual like a fling. So many layers. Is there a pro to a situation ship?
[00:22:09.440] 或者，与更随意的关系，比如一段露水情缘相比，又有什么区别呢？真是错综复杂。这种“暧昧关系”有什么好处吗？
[00:22:19.520]  Yeah I'm gonna say no. Maybe if you're in the driver's seat. I feel like it's just confusing
[00:22:19.520] 嗯，我还是觉得不行。也许如果你掌握主动权的话。我觉得这样反而会让人困惑。
[00:22:29.360]  overall and I rather have something casual or something serious so it's like you know what
[00:22:29.360] 总的来说，我更喜欢轻松随意的或者严肃认真的，所以你知道吗？
[00:22:35.680]  one or the other is versus something that is like both equally casual and serious it's hard to
[00:22:35.680] 二者择一，而另一种既随意又严肃的事物则不然，这很难说。
[00:22:43.600]  because I feel like in a relationship you see this person as someone you like and potentially
[00:22:43.600] 因为我觉得在一段感情关系中，你会把这个人看作是你喜欢的人，而且有可能……
[00:22:48.720]  could be a life partner I feel like at our age. I think that's how it goes once you start seeing
[00:22:48.720] 我觉得在我们这个年纪，可能会遇到人生伴侣。我觉得一旦开始约会，就会有这种感觉。
[00:22:55.680]  someone and it becoming more serious then you're bound to think like oh what could this
[00:22:55.680] 如果某人的情况变得越来越严重，你肯定会想，哦，这到底是怎么回事？
[00:23:01.840]  potential be and could it lead to something more but then if you're consistently like stuck in
[00:23:01.840] 有可能，而且可能会发展成更进一步的关系，但如果你一直陷在这种状态中，那就太糟糕了。
[00:23:07.280]  like a confusing aspect then you're like your brain literally like just racks back and forth between
[00:23:07.280] 就像遇到令人困惑的情况时，你的大脑就会像脱缰的野马一样在两者之间来回奔波。
[00:23:14.160]  is this serious or is this not and then why waste all that emotional capacity on that when you
[00:23:14.160] 这事严重吗？还是无关紧要？如果是，为什么要把那么多精力浪费在这上面呢？
[00:23:19.440]  could be just dating someone who is on the same page as you. True well I feel like there's like
[00:23:19.440] 也可能只是和跟你想法一致的人约会。确实，我觉得好像是这样。
[00:23:25.840]  a pro to everything so if I were to think of a pro of a situation ship it's like even
[00:23:25.840] 凡事都有利弊，所以如果要我说一艘船的优点，那就是……
[00:23:30.960]  those confusing moments could be good learning lessons where you can like learn about yourself
[00:23:30.960] 那些令人困惑的时刻或许是很好的学习机会，让你有机会了解自己。
[00:23:36.080]  and like almost like a trial relationship where there's less pressure or you're like this isn't
[00:23:36.080] 感觉就像一段试用期的关系，压力比较小，或者你会觉得这段关系并不合适。
[00:23:42.000]  going to last let's try something new here. So maybe the pro comes later in situation ship.
[00:23:42.000] 最后，我们来尝试一些新方法。所以，也许专业人士会在情况出现后才出现。
[00:23:47.840]  The pros are the lessons. Yeah the lessons learned. I don't need any more lessons.
[00:23:47.840] 好处就是经验教训。没错，就是吸取的教训。我不需要再上什么课了。
[00:23:54.720]  Sounds like a relationship boot camp or something. I know how many lessons before we
[00:23:54.720] 听起来像个恋爱训练营之类的。我知道在我们……之前要上多少节课。
[00:24:00.000]  meet the one. How many lessons before we know how to communicate properly.
[00:24:00.000] 遇见真命天子/女。我们需要上多少节课才能学会如何正确沟通？
[00:24:06.800]  You can be like oh like this is how this person doesn't communicate.
[00:24:06.800] 你可以这样想：哦，原来这个人不这样沟通。
[00:24:12.800]  You're like I should avoid this in the future. Like wow this thing really upset me.
[00:24:12.800] 你会想，我以后应该避免这种情况。比如，哇，这件事真的让我很生气。
[00:24:21.680]  That's a pro you get you learn more about what upsets you. Yeah you're like this doesn't work
[00:24:21.680] 这是个好处，你会更了解什么会让你不高兴。是啊，你会觉得这样行不通。
[00:24:28.480]  with you. You're like you know what situations are not for me. That's the real lesson.
[00:24:28.480] 和你在一起，你好像很了解我，知道哪些情况不适合我。这才是真正的教训。
[00:24:37.040]  Okay low key though if I were to think of a specific pro I can kind of see situations ships
[00:24:37.040] 好吧，说实话，如果要我具体说说优点，我能想到一些情况，比如船只。
[00:24:44.480]  being like very fun and I can totally get how it's like emotionally intensive and
[00:24:44.480] 感觉非常有趣，我完全能理解它在情感上为何如此强烈。
[00:24:51.280]  you know laborious in a sense on like how much you have to like pour into the
[00:24:51.280] 你知道，从某种意义上说，这很费力，就像你必须投入很多东西一样。
[00:24:55.440]  situation ship but I feel like there's a certain halo effect to not getting resolution and to like
[00:24:55.440] 虽然情况有点复杂，但我感觉没有得到解决会产生某种光环效应，而且……
[00:25:00.560]  not having sort of the answers to everything. I feel like it could be very stimulating which
[00:25:00.560] 并非所有问题都有答案。我觉得这可能会非常具有启发性。
[00:25:06.720]  may be in the long run is not good but I feel like in the short term it can be very intensely
[00:25:06.720] 从长远来看可能不好，但我觉得短期内可能会非常强烈。
[00:25:11.200]  passionate and fun. Yeah like in the moment maybe like it can be fun like a short and sweet
[00:25:11.200] 充满激情又有趣。是啊，就像当下那样，也许会很有趣，就像一段短暂而甜蜜的时光。
[00:25:17.760]  before it goes downhill. So you got to do it while you're young while you have energy.
[00:25:17.760] 趁着年轻精力充沛的时候去做吧。
[00:25:23.280]  That's true. Oh wait do old people have situations? Oh my god good question. Oh my god okay question
[00:25:23.280] 没错。等等，老年人也会遇到各种问题吗？我的天，问得好。我的天，好吧，这个问题问得好。
[00:25:31.360]  like if you're in the middle of a divorce is that a situation ship? Wait like with your
[00:25:31.360] 比如，如果你正在经历离婚，那算不算一段“关系船”？等等，就像你
[00:25:38.240]  like the wife and husband. I feel like that would just be like you're in the middle of a
[00:25:38.240] 就像夫妻一样。我觉得那就像你身处……之中
[00:25:44.160]  divorce. Like not that you're in a situation because it's quite defined like oh that's my
[00:25:44.160] 离婚。不是说你身处某种境地，因为情况很明确，比如，哦，那是我的
[00:25:49.600]  divorce partner. But they're taking a long time to sign the papers like you know in the movies. Oh
[00:25:49.600] 离婚伴侣。但他们签文件拖了很久，就像电影里演的那样。哦
[00:25:55.200]  like will they or will they not sign it? No I think at that point they're just your ex. Yeah I'm
[00:25:55.200] 他们会签吗？还是不会签？我觉得到了那个时候，他们就只是你的前任了。是啊，我是
[00:26:01.840]  starting to think Crystal doesn't know what a situation ship is. But in that moment maybe you
[00:26:01.840] 开始觉得克丽丝塔尔根本不知道什么是情境船。但那一刻，也许你
[00:26:06.960]  can date someone and like or like. Oh yeah and then you can have a situation ship. Yeah while
[00:26:06.960] 你可以和某人约会，喜欢或不喜欢。哦，对了，然后你们还可以发展一段暧昧关系。是的，
[00:26:12.960]  you're getting divorced. Yeah and going back now that we went fast forward in time if we were
[00:26:12.960] 你要离婚了。是啊，现在我们快进到过去，如果我们……
[00:26:18.320]  to go back like what do the young people do? I mean I feel like situations ships in high school are so
[00:26:18.320] 回到过去，年轻人都在做什么？我的意思是，我觉得高中时期的恋爱关系……
[00:26:25.680]  common right? Like maybe I'm just drawing from all of my situations ships in high school but I feel
[00:26:25.680] 很常见吧？也许我只是把我在高中时所有磕的CP都借鉴过来了，但我感觉
[00:26:30.800]  like high school is the perfect breeding ground because no one fucking knows how to date no one
[00:26:30.800] 高中简直就是个完美的温床，因为根本没人知道怎么跟人谈恋爱。
[00:26:35.600]  knows how to communicate. You barely know how to talk to someone of the opposite gender. I
[00:26:35.600] 你懂得如何沟通。你几乎不知道该如何与异性交谈。
[00:26:39.920]  feel like everything is very exciting and also there's no real reason to commit to a relationship
[00:26:39.920] 感觉一切都很令人兴奋，而且也没有真正需要投入一段感情的理由。
[00:26:45.520]  that early. So then I feel like a lot of dating in high school is very like situation shipy. I
[00:26:45.520] 那么早。所以我感觉高中时期的恋爱关系很多都像是一时兴起。
[00:26:49.920]  agree. I feel like all of high school and middle school dating is very situation ship because like
[00:26:49.920] 同意。我觉得高中和初中阶段的恋爱关系都很像“情景恋爱”，因为……
[00:26:55.360]  you can date someone for a week and then they'll be like bye. But don't they call it like they just
[00:26:55.360] 你可能和某人约会一周，然后他们就会说拜拜。但他们不都把这种关系说得好像他们只是……
[00:27:01.200]  have a boyfriend for a week? Like it's not. I guess yeah but I feel like it wouldn't really
[00:27:01.200] 跟男朋友交往一周？这怎么可能？我猜是吧，但感觉不太可能。
[00:27:05.520]  classify as a boyfriend because all you do is like hee hee ha ha. That's true. I think like
[00:27:05.520] 不能算男朋友，因为你只会嘻嘻哈哈。确实如此。我觉得就像
[00:27:11.440]  when a lot of people they like they're like oh I don't even count that. Yeah exactly. Yeah maybe
[00:27:11.440] 当他们喜欢很多人的时候，他们会说，哦，我根本不把那算在内。对，没错。也许吧。
[00:27:16.400]  that's like hindsight you're like oh that was a situation ship but in the moment as a young child
[00:27:16.400] 那就像事后诸葛亮，你会觉得“哦，那只是一场情境”，但当时你还是个孩子。
[00:27:21.920]  you're like that was my boyfriend. That was the love of my life. I think there was probably like
[00:27:21.920] 你就像……那是我男朋友。那是我一生的挚爱。我想大概……
[00:27:29.120]  one time in high school that would actually qualify as like a real situation ship for me where
[00:27:29.120] 高中时有一次，对我来说，那件事真的可以算得上是一次真实的“船”事件。
[00:27:34.240]  we truly weren't boyfriend and girlfriend but it was kind of like what are we slash
[00:27:34.240] 我们其实并不是男女朋友关系，但感觉有点像……（此处疑似拼写错误，无法翻译）
[00:27:38.800]  TBD on the TTR kind of situation? I feel like what I found very weird about it was even though a
[00:27:38.800] 关于TTR的情况还有待确定吗？我觉得最奇怪的是，即使……
[00:27:45.280]  situation ship isn't a real relationship I felt like we started to go through like a real like a
[00:27:45.280] 这段关系并非真正的恋爱关系，我觉得我们开始经历一段像真正的恋爱关系一样的感情。
[00:27:50.080]  legitimate breakup and I was kind of like how come it's something that isn't that formal or
[00:27:50.080] 正式分手了，我当时就想，为什么分手过程没那么正式呢？
[00:27:56.400]  serious or official seeming but the end you still have to make it like official. Oh true I feel
[00:27:56.400] 看起来很严肃或正式，但最终你还是得让它显得正式一些。哦，确实如此，我也有同感。
[00:28:02.960]  like there are like breakups to situation ships like there's like an ending. Yeah I guess because
[00:28:02.960] 就像情侣之间会有分手，就像会有结局一样。嗯，我想是因为
[00:28:09.680]  you're essentially explaining why you're cutting them off or like why you can't be in a relationship
[00:28:09.680] 你其实是在解释你为什么要断绝和他们的联系，或者为什么你不能继续谈恋爱。
[00:28:16.640]  yeah yeah because I think you can't really just go back to being friends let's say if you did
[00:28:16.640] 是啊是啊，因为我觉得就算你们真的……也很难再回到朋友关系了。
[00:28:21.280]  start out as friends like in high school but since there was like a romantic aspect involved and
[00:28:21.280] 一开始像高中同学一样是朋友，但因为其中掺杂了浪漫的成分，
[00:28:26.800]  it's like really hard to just like oh yeah we're friends again buddy hey buddy
[00:28:26.800] 真的很难像那样说：“哦，对，我们又成为朋友了，哥们儿，嘿，哥们儿。”
[00:28:32.160]  is there a timeline for how long or short it can be? I don't think so but I do think that there's
[00:28:32.160] 是否有关于持续时间长短的时间表？我不认为有，但我确实认为存在……
[00:28:39.440]  like this whole thing on tiktok where it's like a three month rule I do think it's we should follow
[00:28:39.440] 就像TikTok上那个三个月规则一样，我觉得我们应该遵守。
[00:28:43.680]  that when something starts and then three months after is when like people start showing you their
[00:28:43.680] 当某件事开始后三个月左右，人们就开始向你展示他们的……
[00:28:49.520]  true colors because if people are usually like the best they can be in the beginning and then
[00:28:49.520] 真面目，因为人们通常一开始都会展现出他们最好的一面，然后……
[00:28:54.640]  in that three months is like when you figure it out if this is the person you want to be with
[00:28:54.640] 在这三个月里，你就能弄清楚这个人是不是你想与之共度一生的人。
[00:29:00.720]  and if they're showing you the best or worse. That's true I feel like the three month mark
[00:29:00.720] 如果他们给你看的是最好的还是最差的。我觉得三个月后确实如此。
[00:29:05.280]  is when people have that conversation like what are we? Yeah do you think there are maybe like
[00:29:05.280] 当人们进行这样的对话时，比如“我们到底是什么？”。是啊，你觉得也许有……
[00:29:12.080]  unspoken rules in a situation ship? Are there certain things you're allowed to expect
[00:29:12.080] 情境船上的潜规则是什么？有哪些事情是可以预期的？
[00:29:18.880]  or is it just like you can't expect anything? I think if there was like some communication of
[00:29:18.880] 或者说，你根本就什么都不能期待？我觉得如果能有一些沟通的话……
[00:29:24.800]  what you expected then I think it's okay to expect these things but I don't think you should
[00:29:24.800] 你当时期望的是什么？我觉得有这些期望是可以的，但我觉得你不应该抱有这些期望。
[00:29:32.240]  expect anything in a situation ship because I feel like it's not like an actual
[00:29:32.240] 在情景船上不要抱有任何期待，因为我觉得它不像是一艘真正的飞船。
[00:29:37.520]  committed relationship where you have security and like a sense of that person's
[00:29:37.520] 一段稳定的关系，在这种关系中，你能够获得安全感，并喜欢对方的陪伴。
[00:29:41.840]  going to be there for a while so basically all fair game I would say if they were to like do stuff
[00:29:41.840] 他们会在那儿待一段时间，所以基本上一切皆有可能，如果他们真要做什么的话。
[00:29:48.800]  that you wouldn't be able to get mad because essentially you're not in a relationship. Yeah I
[00:29:48.800] 你不会生气，因为你们本质上并没有恋爱关系。是的，我
[00:29:54.720]  feel like you can't expect to know them outside of just like your guys as a relationship like you
[00:29:54.720] 感觉你不能指望像了解你的朋友那样了解他们，就像你和他们建立恋爱关系一样。
[00:29:59.680]  shouldn't expect to meet their friends or like you know outside of that relationship what they
[00:29:59.680] 不应该期望见到他们的朋友，或者你知道，在恋爱关系之外他们会做什么。
[00:30:04.480]  do but in a relationship like you expect to kind of like meet their friends family and like
[00:30:04.480] 确实如此，但在这种关系中，你会希望见到他们的朋友、家人等等。
[00:30:10.800]  get to know them outside of even the relationship context. Okay how about this do you think in a
[00:30:10.800] 即使在恋爱关系之外，也要了解他们。好吧，你觉得这样如何？
[00:30:18.000]  situation ship you have the right to be jealous? I think you personally have a right to be jealous
[00:30:18.000] 这种情况你有权利嫉妒吗？我认为你个人有权利嫉妒。
[00:30:27.920]  but if you did not communicate in wanting it to be exclusive or them like not dating other people
[00:30:27.920] 但如果你没有沟通表明你希望这段关系是专属的，或者他们不希望你和其他人约会，那么
[00:30:36.240]  while you guys are together then I don't think you have the right if you haven't communicated that
[00:30:36.240] 如果你们俩还在一起，而你们又没有沟通过，我认为你没有权利这么做。
[00:30:42.000]  or you don't have the right to get like upset at them. Yeah because I guess you could you could
[00:30:42.000] 或者说，你没有权利对他们生气。是啊，因为我觉得你可以，你可以。
[00:30:46.640]  still have like boundaries in a situation ship right? Yeah of course. Yeah I feel like these
[00:30:46.640] 在一段关系中，还是应该有界限的，对吧？当然。是的，我觉得这些
[00:30:52.640]  things that you can't expect from a situation ship feel like it would be so hard to not expect
[00:30:52.640] 在一段情境中，有些事情是你无法预料的，但你却很难不去期待它们。
[00:31:00.160]  those things you know what I mean? Right? I know theoretically like oh it's just a situation
[00:31:00.160] 你知道我说的那些事吧？对吧？我理论上明白，哦，这只是一种情况而已。
[00:31:04.720]  ship it's not a real relationship therefore of all x y and z but then I feel like if I were to be
[00:31:04.720] 我觉得这不算真正的恋爱关系，所以尽管有各种各样的原因，但我觉得如果我要……
[00:31:09.600]  in that situation like I would still feel all of these things and maybe you would turn into like
[00:31:09.600] 在这种情况下，我仍然会感受到所有这些情绪，也许你会变成那样……
[00:31:14.160]  resentment about why we are this way or even like self-loathing in a sense of like oh this person
[00:31:14.160] 怨恨我们为什么会变成这样，甚至有点像自我厌恶，比如“哦，这个人……”
[00:31:19.920]  seems fine but like how come I'm so emotionally invested? Dude that's why I feel like 99% of
[00:31:19.920] 看起来没什么问题，但我为什么会这么投入感情？兄弟，这就是为什么我觉得99%的时间……
[00:31:25.760]  them become toxic. Yeah that's so true because of that you know yeah no one's really
[00:31:25.760] 它们会变得有毒。是啊，确实如此，因为你知道，是啊，没人真的
[00:31:33.040]  communicating so no one's getting their needs met so. Okay I have a question have any of you
[00:31:33.040] 沟通不畅导致没有人的需求得到满足。好吧，我有个问题，你们谁有？
[00:31:39.440]  experienced a situation ship where it actually successfully exited situation ship and like
[00:31:39.440] 经历过一次情境船事件，但实际上成功地脱离了情境船，就像
[00:31:47.520]  maybe kind of went into relationship? I want to say yes yes yes sir.
[00:31:47.520] 或许算是发展成恋爱关系了？我想说，是的，是的，先生。
[00:31:54.160]  It's too many yes sir. I think I might be a no. There's some denial in there.
[00:31:54.160] 太多“是，先生”了。我觉得我可能应该说“不”。这里面有些否认的成分。
[00:32:05.600]  Oh wait I think so too because I think like I don't a lot of the times like when I'm single
[00:32:05.600] 哦等等，我也这么觉得，因为我很多时候都想不到这些，尤其是在我单身的时候。
[00:32:11.360]  and I'm dating like I don't go into the mindset of like I'm gonna find my life partner
[00:32:11.360] 我约会的时候并没有想着要找到人生伴侣。
[00:32:16.160]  I kind of go in the mindset of like oh if I like this person I'll see them again
[00:32:16.160] 我当时的想法是，如果我喜欢这个人，我还会再见他们的。
[00:32:20.080]  and also I feel like it gets to a point where you have to talk about oh I think I'm starting to like you
[00:32:20.080] 而且我觉得到了某个阶段，你不得不说“哦，我想我开始喜欢你了”。
[00:32:26.160]  we're doing a lot of basically relationship-y things where do you see yourself going from this
[00:32:26.160] 我们现在做了很多关于恋爱关系的事情，你觉得接下来你们的关系会走向何方？
[00:32:32.000]  and then eventually I feel like either it's a yes or no so. Yeah and then after that talk that
[00:32:32.000] 最后我觉得答案要么是“是”，要么是“否”。嗯，在那次谈话之后……
[00:32:38.000]  like evolves into a real relationship. Yeah exactly. So basically you two are able to
[00:32:38.000] 就像发展成一段真正的关系一样。没错。所以基本上你们两个能够……
[00:32:46.240]  communicate and that helps you get out of the situation. Yeah that's key. Hell yeah
[00:32:46.240] 沟通能帮你摆脱困境。没错，这才是关键。绝对的。
[00:32:53.600]  if you can't make that leap then it just ends there. Do you think so if you are the person who
[00:32:53.600] 如果你无法实现这一飞跃，那就到此为止了。如果你是那个人，你觉得会是这样吗？
[00:33:00.480]  is developing feelings for the other person in a situation ship and you muster up the courage
[00:33:00.480] 在一段感情关系中，你对对方产生了感情，并鼓起勇气
[00:33:05.680]  to have that convo right like oh I think I like you beyond what the situation ship is do you
[00:33:05.680] 如果能进行那种对话，比如“哦，我觉得我喜欢你，超越了我们之间的感情关系”，你会怎么想？
[00:33:10.720]  think you also have to brace yourself in case that person says no to go into like a full breakup?
[00:33:10.720] 你是不是也得做好心理准备，万一对方拒绝彻底分手呢？
[00:33:17.040]  Oh maybe it's like you have to prepare yourself remind yourself what your boundaries are. Yeah
[00:33:17.040] 哦，或许你需要做好准备，提醒自己哪些是底线。是的。
[00:33:23.200]  I think it depends on whether or not you're looking for a relationship out of him and that's why
[00:33:23.200] 我认为这取决于你是否想和他发展恋爱关系，这就是原因。
[00:33:28.480]  you're saying like hey I like you I want a DTR versus hey I like you and that's it.
[00:33:28.480] 你是说“嘿，我喜欢你，我想确定恋爱关系”，而不是“嘿，我喜欢你，仅此而已”。
[00:33:35.360]  So like is it a personal deal breaker? Yeah depends on what you want essentially from that relationship.
[00:33:35.360] 所以这算是个人层面上的决定性因素吗？嗯，这主要取决于你对这段关系的期望。
[00:33:41.920]  I can totally imagine someone confessing and then the other person's like oh like I don't know yeah
[00:33:41.920] 我完全可以想象有人表白，然后另一个人却说，哦，我不知道，是啊。
[00:33:48.080]  I can't really give you an answer on you know like labels and stuff and the original person is just
[00:33:48.080] 我真的没办法回答你关于标签之类的问题，而且原作者也只是……
[00:33:53.760]  like okay that situation continues. No I feel like it usually goes along the lines like oh I like
[00:33:53.760] 好吧，这种情况还在继续。不，我觉得通常会是这样的：哦，我喜欢
[00:34:00.960]  you too but I don't know if I'm ready for a relationship usually they like you back right
[00:34:00.960] 你也是，但我不知道自己是否准备好谈恋爱。通常情况下，他们也喜欢你，对吧？
[00:34:06.080]  they're not ready to like make the leap yeah and then you're just stuck back in the situation ship.
[00:34:06.080] 他们还没准备好做出这样的飞跃，然后你就又被困在原地了。
[00:34:12.480]  Yeah exactly you're like sounds good you're like trying to get all out of the hole but no they pull
[00:34:12.480] 对，没错，你感觉听起来不错，你想摆脱困境，但结果却事与愿违。
[00:34:16.720]  you right back into it. You're like should we circle back next month? Yeah exactly. Well I'm just visualizing this time.
[00:34:16.720] 你又重新投入进去了。你会想，我们下个月是不是该再来？对，没错。嗯，我这次只是在做个心理准备。
[00:34:24.320]  Trying to get out of the hole and they pull us back. They're like lol. No like dirt.
[00:34:24.320] 我们想从坑里出来，结果他们又把我们拉了回来。他们哈哈大笑。不，就像泥土一样。
[00:34:34.080]  I do want to circle back to your guys's like success stories of converting a situation ship
[00:34:34.080] 我想再聊聊你们关于改造困境船只的成功案例。
[00:34:39.840]  into a real relationship because I think what we were talking about before kind of classified
[00:34:39.840] 想发展成一段真正的关系，因为我觉得我们之前谈论的那些事有点儿太私密了。
[00:34:45.920]  situations ships as like 90% toxic so for these success stories would you say that
[00:34:45.920] 目前的情况是，船舶运营中大约90%都是有毒的，那么对于这些成功案例，您会怎么说呢？
[00:34:52.240]  that situation ship part of that relationship was toxic or would you think it was like the 10%
[00:34:52.240] 那段关系中，只有一部分是有毒的，或者你觉得只有10%的概率是这样？
[00:34:57.920]  like it truly was just a healthy situation ship that eventually evolved? If it doesn't involve
[00:34:57.920] 就像它真的只是一艘健康发展的船，最终演变成现在的样子？如果它不涉及
[00:35:03.440]  into a relationship then then it just becomes toxic. So like up to a point it can be okay.
[00:35:03.440] 如果发展成恋爱关系，然后就变得有害了。所以，在某种程度上，这可能是可以接受的。
[00:35:10.720]  Because I think that's the confusing aspect or it becomes like the toxic part of it because
[00:35:10.720] 因为我觉得这就是令人困惑的地方，或者说，这就是它产生负面影响的地方。
[00:35:16.160]  no one's getting their needs met and you're in this limbo there's no trajectory and you don't know
[00:35:16.160] 没有人能满足自己的需求，你陷入了这种进退两难的境地，没有前进的方向，你也不知道未来会怎样。
[00:35:22.720]  what the future lies basically so it's like a circle of toxicity I feel like. Do you think that
[00:35:22.720] 这就是未来，我觉得它就像一个恶性循环。你觉得呢？
[00:35:30.560]  in a situation ship maybe more of the toxic situations ships you have to compromise and yield
[00:35:30.560] 在某些情况下，尤其是在那些充满毒性的环境中，你可能需要做出妥协和让步。
[00:35:37.600]  more or do you think that the compromises and stuff happen more in a relationship where you are
[00:35:37.600] 还是说你认为在你们的关系中，妥协之类的事情发生得更多？
[00:35:42.800]  expected to be a good partner? Not that you can't be a good partner in a situation. Honestly though
[00:35:42.800] 被期望成为一个好伴侣？并不是说在某些情况下你不能成为一个好伴侣。说实话
[00:35:48.560]  like it could be like a mutually beneficial situation ship where like maybe you don't want
[00:35:48.560] 就像一种互惠互利的关系，也许你并不想要
[00:35:54.000]  a relationship and that person doesn't want to either and you guys can both happily avoid that
[00:35:54.000] 一段感情，而对方也不想，你们俩都可以愉快地避免这种情况。
[00:35:58.240]  conversation. Honestly, that's true. It's like the movie to all the boys I've loved before
[00:35:58.240] 对话。说真的，确实如此。就像电影《致我曾爱过的所有男孩》一样。
[00:36:06.720]  their relationship started off from a contract.
[00:36:06.720] 他们的关系始于一份合同。
[00:36:14.000]  Where I love all these like movie examples.
[00:36:14.000] 我喜欢所有这些电影例子。
[00:36:19.600]  Chris was pulling all the movie examples for us. But yeah I feel like that is an example of
[00:36:19.600] 克里斯给我们列举了很多电影例子。不过，我觉得这就是一个例子。
[00:36:24.960]  something where you're both actually benefiting so I guess that's kind of a pro if it's like
[00:36:24.960] 如果双方都能从中受益，那我觉得这算是一个优点吧。
[00:36:29.680]  okay you're both low key just on the same page about being in a situation ship so it's
[00:36:29.680] 好吧，你们俩其实都对这种“暧昧关系”达成了共识，所以就这样吧。
[00:36:35.440]  like a good thing for a certain amount of time. I think the only thing though is that most of the
[00:36:35.440] 就像一件好事，只是持续时间有限。但我认为唯一的问题是，大多数情况下……
[00:36:42.080]  time even if it starts out that way like one person might catch feelings and then that's when I can
[00:36:42.080] 即使一开始是这样，比如一方可能动了真情，然后我就可以……
[00:36:46.800]  become toxic. Right right. It's like a friend with benefits and someone catches feelings
[00:36:46.800] 变得有害。没错没错。就像炮友关系，然后有人动了真情。
[00:36:51.600]  and then you're like oh no this is not what we discussed. You're like I thought we were alive.
[00:36:51.600] 然后你就会想，哦不，这和我们之前讨论的不一样。你会想，我以为我们还活着呢。
[00:36:56.720]  Yeah like are we not alive? No it happened. I guess though in a situation ship technically
[00:36:56.720] 是啊，难道我们就不是活着的吗？不，它确实发生了。我想，从某种意义上说，在某种情况下，这艘船……
[00:37:03.920]  both parties do already have feelings in order to like be in the whole situation ship.
[00:37:03.920] 双方都已对这段关系产生了感情。
[00:37:12.160]  But I guess it's like when someone starts wanting more right? Right when there's like
[00:37:12.160] 但我想这就像有人开始想要更多的时候，对吧？就像当……
[00:37:17.840]  differing expectations on either what you currently are with this person or what the
[00:37:17.840] 对目前与此人的关系或未来发展方向的不同期望
[00:37:23.120]  future holds for you both as a pair. I feel like it's an interesting question in my mind because
[00:37:23.120] 你们俩的未来会如何？我觉得这个问题很有意思，因为
[00:37:30.800]  if you have different expectations from your situation ship then you would probably have to
[00:37:30.800] 如果你对你的情况船有不同的期望，那么你可能需要这样做。
[00:37:36.880]  compromise a little bit or maybe yield your feelings or hold back your feelings so that
[00:37:36.880] 稍微妥协一下，或者放弃一些感情，或者克制一下感情，这样……
[00:37:41.040]  the situation ship can continue if that's the path that you're choosing. But I also feel like in
[00:37:41.040] 如果你选择这条路，那么情况可以继续下去。但我也觉得在
[00:37:45.680]  a relationship there's a ton of compromising. You are compromising on your schedules and
[00:37:45.680] 一段感情关系中需要做出很多妥协。你们需要在时间安排上做出妥协，而且
[00:37:50.800]  on your preferences to make that relationship continue to work and be healthy so then I can
[00:37:50.800] 根据你的意愿，让这段关系继续发展并保持健康，这样我才能……
[00:37:55.600]  almost see situationships as allowing you to be more independent or like empowering you to be more
[00:37:55.600] 几乎所有人都把这种暧昧关系看作是让你更加独立，或者赋予你更多自主权。
[00:38:00.880]  independent than in the actual relationship. Dude I just had a flashback of like a situation ship
[00:38:00.880] 比在真正的恋爱关系中更独立。老兄，我刚才突然想起一段类似“暧昧关系”的感情经历。
[00:38:08.720]  I had and I remember we were talking a lot and then he was like wait this kind of feels like a
[00:38:08.720] 我当时确实有，我记得我们聊了很多，然后他说，等等，这感觉有点像……
[00:38:13.760]  real relationship but in a bad way. Like the way he said it and I was like oh what does that mean?
[00:38:13.760] 一段真实的感情，但却是糟糕的感情。他说话的方式让我很困惑，我当时就想，哦，这是什么意思？
[00:38:20.480]  I should step back a bit. That's crazy to say. In a bad way? Well he didn't say in a bad way but
[00:38:20.480] 我应该退后一步。这么说真够疯狂的。是往坏处想吗？嗯，他没说往坏处想，但是
[00:38:28.480]  like I felt like in a bad way. Oh okay okay okay okay. Can you imagine he was like but in a bad way?
[00:38:28.480] 我当时感觉糟透了。哦，好吧好吧好吧好吧。你能想象他当时的心情吗？但感觉糟透了？
[00:38:35.680]  I'm like you'll get them. Get out what the hell? I feel like the other thing too is like
[00:38:35.680] 我心想你会得到它们的。滚出去，搞什么鬼？我觉得另一件事也像是……
[00:38:42.080]  in a relationship if I have something that I want to bring up that I feel like is not
[00:38:42.080] 在一段感情关系中，如果我有一些想提出来但我觉得不合适的事情，
[00:38:46.400]  positive or healthy then I kind of have some sort of trust of like okay my SO will want to work on
[00:38:46.400] 如果对方是积极健康的，那我就会对他/她抱有一定的信任，觉得他会愿意努力。
[00:38:52.400]  this and work through this with me but in a situation ship I feel like there's no guarantee
[00:38:52.400] 这件事，请和我一起想办法解决，但在目前这种情况下，我觉得没有任何保证。
[00:38:56.640]  there's no insurance it's like if I bring this up I may not see this man for the rest of my life.
[00:38:56.640] 没有保险，感觉如果我提起这件事，我这辈子可能都见不到这个人了。
[00:39:01.280]  You know what I mean? I feel like there's like some level of risk there so then I can also
[00:39:01.280] 你明白我的意思吗？我觉得这里面存在一定的风险，所以我也可以
[00:39:05.440]  see that maybe being more problematic or causing you to kind of hold back like oh is this worth
[00:39:05.440] 看看这是否会带来更多问题，或者让你有所顾虑，比如“哦，这值得吗？”
[00:39:11.680]  having you know like a very serious conversation because if not then I'll just table it for later.
[00:39:11.680] 我们需要进行一次非常严肃的谈话，否则我就只能以后再说了。
[00:39:17.280]  Yeah I feel like it's just too ambiguous for you to be like confrontational about
[00:39:17.280] 是啊，我觉得这件事太模棱两可了，你没必要直接对抗。
[00:39:22.960]  your feelings at the moment you like kind of second guess yourself you're like oh
[00:39:22.960] 你此刻的感受，有点像是在自我怀疑，你会想：哦
[00:39:26.560]  should I bring it up should I not and then you usually probably don't end up bringing it up.
[00:39:26.560] 我该不该提起这件事？通常情况下，你最终可能都不会提起它。
[00:39:31.120]  That's true because it's like at that point it's not us it's like me and you it's very separate.
[00:39:31.120] 确实如此，因为在那一刻，就不是“我们”了，而是“你”和“我”完全分开了。
[00:39:36.560]  Exactly. I wonder like are there cultural differences in situationships? Is it different in America
[00:39:36.560] 没错。我想知道，比如，不同文化背景下的“暧昧关系”是否存在差异？在美国是不是也一样？
[00:39:43.120]  versus Korea or even west coast east coast? Dude probably. Probably like slight differences.
[00:39:43.120] 跟韩国比，或者跟东西海岸比？哥们儿，可能吧。可能只是细微差别。
[00:39:51.680]  Dude I think there's more situationships in big cities. Oh 100%. I think just because
[00:39:51.680] 老兄，我觉得大城市里暧昧关系更多。哦，百分之百同意。我觉得就是因为……
[00:39:59.120]  there's like too many options so you're just like I want to keep my options open.
[00:39:59.120] 选择太多了，所以你会想，我想保留所有选择。
[00:40:03.360]  Yeah like think of LA and like New York the dating there is so. It's very fast paced.
[00:40:03.360] 对，想想洛杉矶和纽约，那里的约会节奏非常快。
[00:40:09.920]  Yeah and then suburbs it's like we're about to get married. Yeah actually though.
[00:40:09.920] 是啊，到了郊区，感觉就像我们要结婚了一样。确实如此。
[00:40:19.520]  Oh my god that's so true. That's true you like skip the situation should you're like I don't
[00:40:19.520] 我的天哪，说得太对了。确实如此，如果你不想面对这种情况，那就直接跳过吧。
[00:40:23.760]  have time for this. Yeah like where is the ring at? We're either dating or we're not like
[00:40:23.760] 有时间考虑这些。是啊，戒指在哪儿呢？我们要么在交往，要么就不是。
[00:40:28.640]  get it together. Like what else? Like take your lane. Yeah and then the big city everyone's like
[00:40:28.640] 振作起来。还能怎样？管好你自己的事。是啊，然后到了大城市，每个人都像……
[00:40:34.160]  yeah I'm not sure there's like five other like dates lined up in the day. Yeah they're like
[00:40:34.160] 是啊，我不确定，那天好像还有其他五个约会安排。是啊，他们就像
[00:40:38.800]  I want to drive here and here. Kind of thinking of like city versus suburb
[00:40:38.800] 我想开车来这里，再来这里。有点像在考虑城市和郊区的区别。
[00:40:45.440]  thing with the whole situation ship maybe another factor to situationships is like
[00:40:45.440] 关于这种“暧昧关系”，或许另一个影响因素是……
[00:40:51.840]  possibility of other options one or both parties in the situation ship aren't ready to
[00:40:51.840] 还有其他选择的可能性，即双方或其中一方尚未做好准备。
[00:40:59.120]  let go of other possibilities yet so then it ends up being like a situation ship. You're like hedging
[00:40:59.120] 放弃其他可能性，最终就像一艘待定船。你就像在对冲风险。
[00:41:06.960]  your bets essentially. I want to put all my eggs in this basket. Yeah true you're like trying out
[00:41:06.960] 基本上，你这是孤注一掷。我想把所有鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里。是啊，没错，你就像是在试探。
[00:41:13.680]  different relationships. Multiple situationships. Dude I don't understand it though because I feel
[00:41:13.680] 不同的关系。多重暧昧关系。兄弟，我真不明白，因为我觉得
[00:41:20.560]  that's so tiring. Yeah me going on like two dates I'm like I'm done. I'm exhausted. Okay but actually
[00:41:20.560] 太累了。是啊，我约会两次就感觉精疲力竭了，不行了。好吧，其实
[00:41:29.600]  like if you're going into dating kind of with the more mindset of like oh I'm just dating for fun
[00:41:29.600] 比如，如果你抱着“我只是为了好玩才约会”的心态去谈恋爱的话。
[00:41:36.960]  do you think that also causes more situationships? Yeah if you're not like dating to like meet your
[00:41:36.960] 你觉得这也会导致更多暧昧关系吗？是啊，如果你不像约会那样是为了认识新朋友。
[00:41:44.400]  life partner or like to get married etc etc I think it does that's not in your plan right you're
[00:41:44.400] 寻找人生伴侣或者想结婚等等，我觉得这不在你的计划之内，对吧？
[00:41:52.000]  not really thinking for the future you're just thinking for the now. I think that's totally fine
[00:41:52.000] 你没有真正考虑未来，只考虑当下。我觉得这完全没问题。
[00:41:56.080]  but then maybe you meet someone who is thinking of something like something in the future then
[00:41:56.080] 但也许你会遇到一个正在考虑未来某件事的人。
[00:42:00.560]  it's just not aligned and it becomes like a messy situation ship. I have like a random hypothetical
[00:42:00.560] 它就是不协调，就像一艘状况混乱的船。我随便举个例子……
[00:42:07.600]  but I'm very curious to know what everyone's answers are so say you're in a situation ship
[00:42:07.600] 但我很好奇大家的答案，所以假设你身处一艘船上。
[00:42:12.400]  with someone and you don't want it to end but that person is actively dating other people
[00:42:12.400] 你和某人在一起，你不想分手，但那个人却在积极地和其他人约会。
[00:42:17.600]  and they're open about it like he's like oh I really like you but I'm also dating other people
[00:42:17.600] 他们对此毫不隐瞒，比如他会说：“哦，我真的很喜欢你，但我同时也在和其他人约会。”
[00:42:22.320]  but you still like first and foremost really like this person so would you match their energy
[00:42:22.320] 但你首先还是非常喜欢这个人，所以你会和他们一样充满活力吗？
[00:42:28.960]  and go out and date other people or would you end the situation ship? I guess the third
[00:42:28.960] 你会出去和其他人约会，还是会结束这段关系？我猜是第三种。
[00:42:34.320]  option is you tell them like hey I think this is a deal breaker can you stop seeing other people?
[00:42:34.320] 你可以这样告诉他们：“嘿，我觉得这是个大问题，你能停止和其他人约会吗？”
[00:42:39.440]  I don't think I would go date other people unless I knew I had the mental capacity to do that
[00:42:39.440] 除非我确信自己有足够的心理能力，否则我不会去和其他人约会。
[00:42:49.200]  I think I'm not- that's a crystal answer
[00:42:49.200] 我觉得我不是——这答案很明确。
[00:42:51.840]  I'm tired yeah multiple people what? I don't think I'm petty enough to be like let me just
[00:42:51.840] 我累了，是啊，好几个人？什么？我觉得我没那么小气，不会说“就让我来吧”。
[00:42:59.360]  use the rest of my like strength to go date as many people just to piss off this guy
[00:42:59.360] 我要用剩下的力气去和尽可能多的人约会，就为了气气这家伙。
[00:43:05.040]  but like maybe I would assess the situation you know if I'm like okay I can just like keep a casual
[00:43:05.040] 但也许我会评估一下情况，你知道，如果我觉得“好吧，我可以保持轻松随意”
[00:43:12.640]  for a while and see how that goes I probably wouldn't mind that too much but if I was like
[00:43:12.640] 先试一段时间，看看情况如何，我可能不会太介意，但如果我是……
[00:43:18.960]  oh no like this has to be a relationship then I would probably draw boundary
[00:43:18.960] 哦不，如果这非得发展成恋爱关系的话，那我大概会划清界限。
[00:43:23.440]  I feel like if they were like super upfront about it in the beginning like say like oh
[00:43:23.440] 我觉得如果他们一开始就非常坦诚地说明情况，比如说“哦……”
[00:43:28.560]  I like you but I'm also like seeing other people then I would be like I think that is actually
[00:43:28.560] 我喜欢你，但我同时也喜欢和其他人在一起，然后我会想，我觉得那才是真正的你。
[00:43:33.120]  very very good because at least you're transparent about what you're doing what what else you're doing
[00:43:33.120] 非常好，因为至少你对你在做什么以及你在做的其他事情都很透明。
[00:43:38.240]  and you're not lying to the person you're seeing or hiding withholding information so I feel like
[00:43:38.240] 而且你也没有对你约会的对象撒谎或隐瞒信息，所以我感觉
[00:43:45.280]  then that creates a whole distrust and then it becomes like a messy situation ship right but
[00:43:45.280] 那样就会造成完全的不信任，然后情况就会变得一团糟，对吧？
[00:43:50.560]  if they're upfront about it in the beginning I feel like I think personally I would already
[00:43:50.560] 如果他们一开始就坦诚相待，我觉得我个人应该已经会同意了。
[00:43:56.800]  probably be seeing other people too if he had told me that because then then we were like oh we're
[00:43:56.800] 如果他告诉我这些，那他可能也在和其他人约会，因为那样的话我们就会觉得，哦，我们是
[00:44:02.800]  both openly seeing other people we're all kind of both on the same page and then I feel like if
[00:44:02.800] 我们俩都公开和其他人约会，所以我们其实都处在同一个立场上，然后我觉得如果
[00:44:07.760]  I end up liking him a lot more then maybe I would be like oh hey I think I really like you
[00:44:07.760] 最后我发现自己比想象中更喜欢他，也许我会说：“哦，嘿，我觉得我真的很喜欢你。”
[00:44:13.600]  and I see your relationship with you I don't know if I can continue seeing you if you're
[00:44:13.600] 我看到了你和我的这种关系，如果你……我不知道我是否还能继续和你交往。
[00:44:18.880]  seeing other people and draw that boundary because then then it gets messy you start feeling
[00:44:18.880] 和其他人交往时，要划清界限，因为那样事情就会变得很复杂，你会开始感到……
[00:44:23.520]  jealous and like all of that other feelings right I had a situation ship where it was similar
[00:44:23.520] 嫉妒，还有其他种种类似的感觉，对吧？我之前也遇到过类似的情况。
[00:44:29.520]  a little bit different we both liked each other I think we were both still kind of dating other people
[00:44:29.520] 我们俩有点不一样，我们彼此喜欢，我觉得我们当时都还在和其他人约会。
[00:44:35.600]  too but then at one point he was like I really like you I wish like you would stop seeing other
[00:44:35.600] 但后来他突然说：“我真的很喜欢你，我希望你能停止和其他人约会。”
[00:44:41.040]  people but then he didn't say he would stop seeing other people so I was like no it can't be one
[00:44:41.040] 但他并没有说他会停止和其他人见面，所以我就想，不可能吧。
[00:44:48.960]  sided that's crazy yeah which is very crazy so I'm like either we both stop seeing other people
[00:44:48.960] 就我个人而言，这太疯狂了，真的太疯狂了，所以我想，要么我们俩都停止和其他人约会。
[00:44:54.960]  or we both continue to date right yeah so respectful yeah so we both just continue
[00:44:54.960] 或者我们俩继续交往，对吧？这样互相尊重，所以我们俩就继续交往。
[00:45:04.080]  hey that's a quality baby I love that I love that yeah I was like why is it just me like yeah girl power
[00:45:04.080] 嘿，这宝贝真棒，我喜欢，我喜欢，是啊，我当时就在想，为什么只有我这么觉得，是啊，女孩力量
[00:45:11.520]  that's so weird for us true yeah I like you so much like I want you to stop seeing others but
[00:45:11.520] 这对我们来说真的太奇怪了，真的，我非常喜欢你，我希望你不要再和其他人见面了，但是
[00:45:17.600]  not I'm like I'm like you see other people though that's like that's more like uh I like myself
[00:45:17.600] 不，我就像你看到其他人那样，不过，我更喜欢我自己。
[00:45:22.960]  so much that I want to stop seeing other people true oh my god the audacity of
[00:45:22.960] 如此之深，以至于我都不想再见其他人了，天哪，这简直太厚颜无耻了。
[00:45:29.920]  saying that do you think it's fair to ask like what would it take for you to want to be exclusive
[00:45:29.920] 这么说吧，你觉得问“你需要什么条件才会想要一段专属关系”这个问题公平吗？
[00:45:40.400]  I think so I don't think it's a unfair question to ask but if like they themselves don't know
[00:45:40.400] 我觉得是这样。我觉得问这个问题并不算过分，但如果他们自己也不知道的话……
[00:45:46.160]  what they want they're not going to be able to come up with an answer like maybe that question
[00:45:46.160] 他们想要的答案，他们可能无法给出，比如这个问题。
[00:45:50.800]  is too hard you know like if someone asked you that like what would you say I'm like
[00:45:50.800] 太难了，你知道吗？就像如果有人问你这个问题，你会怎么回答？我当时就想：
[00:45:58.960]  it's like relationship negotiating yeah I'm like oh they're like sorry I don't know myself
[00:45:58.960] 这就像人际关系谈判一样，对，我就想，哦，他们会说，抱歉，我自己也不了解。
[00:46:05.440]  that well enough yet I know check back in a month I think it's okay to say like check back in a month
[00:46:05.440] 这样就足够了，不过我知道一个月后再来看看，我觉得这样说“一个月后再来看看”是可以的。
[00:46:12.720]  check
[00:46:12.720]  查看
[00:46:15.040]  you're like not yet like yeah yeah I think that's fair too to be like oh I need some time to like
[00:46:15.040] 你好像还没准备好，嗯嗯，我觉得这样也挺合理的，就像“哦，我需要一些时间”一样。
[00:46:21.040]  think about this so to wrap up this episode today I do have a final question for everyone
[00:46:21.040] 思考一下，所以今天这期节目就到此结束了，我还有一个问题想问大家。
[00:46:27.680]  what are your words of advice for someone who may feel like they're stuck in a toxic
[00:46:27.680] 对于那些感觉自己深陷有毒关系中的人，你有什么建议？
[00:46:32.960]  situation or maybe are just recovering from leaving a toxic situation therapy
[00:46:32.960] 情况可能是正在发生变化，或者可能只是刚刚摆脱一段糟糕的关系，需要接受治疗。
[00:46:43.200]  well okay I do think well therapy is helpful in general but I also think it's a good space to
[00:46:43.200] 嗯，我确实认为心理治疗总体上是有帮助的，而且我也认为这是一个很好的空间……
[00:46:49.840]  practice and learn about proper communication styles and then like reflect on that and how you
[00:46:49.840] 练习并学习恰当的沟通方式，然后反思这些方式以及你如何运用它们。
[00:46:58.640]  can improve yourself because honestly the only thing you can really control in these situations
[00:46:58.640] 你可以提升自己，因为说实话，在这些情况下，你唯一真正能控制的就是自己。
[00:47:04.800]  is how you act and how you present yourself so if you constantly show your partner healthy practices
[00:47:04.800] 你的行为举止和个人形象至关重要。如果你不断向伴侣展现健康的生活习惯，那么你的伴侣就会受益匪浅。
[00:47:13.200]  and healthy communication then that will probably hopefully encourage them to reciprocate it they'll
[00:47:13.200] 如果沟通健康，这或许能鼓励他们做出回应。
[00:47:19.840]  be like oh well this person is being very transparent and like clear with me so I will try my best to
[00:47:19.840] 我会想，哦，这个人很坦诚，跟我很清晰，所以我也会尽力而为。
[00:47:25.680]  also be clear with them and I guess it's also like if even that doesn't work then you know to run
[00:47:25.680] 也要跟他们说清楚，我想如果连这都不管用，那你就知道该跑了。
[00:47:30.960]  yeah at least you try yeah exactly I don't know why the first words but I thought of was like protect
[00:47:30.960] 是啊，至少你尝试了。没错，我也不知道为什么我脑海里第一个想到的词是“保护”。
[00:47:36.560]  yourself girl run because I don't want people to be like so heartbroken you know over situations
[00:47:36.560] 你自己跑吧，女孩，因为我不想让人们因为这些事而伤心欲绝。
[00:47:46.240]  just at that point you're just testing it out no need to like do everything for this one person
[00:47:46.240] 那时候你只是在测试，没必要为了这个人做所有事。
[00:47:52.560]  protect your heart oh and I also feel like you can after a situation ship ends I feel like you
[00:47:52.560] 保护好你的心哦，我觉得在一段关系结束后，你可以做到，我觉得你
[00:47:59.680]  can take all of that emotional capacity that you focused on the other person and just put it all
[00:47:59.680] 你可以把所有原本集中在对方身上的情感能量都倾泻而出。
[00:48:05.200]  to yourself and like figure out what you want what you like I also think after like an ending
[00:48:05.200] 对自己说，弄清楚你想要什么，你喜欢什么。我觉得在结束之后，也要好好想想。
[00:48:11.520]  of a situation ship it can almost be a blessing to like learn from that because you could be like
[00:48:11.520] 从某种情况下，从中吸取教训几乎是一种福气，因为你可能会……
[00:48:16.240]  oh thank god that was just a situation ship and I didn't have to go through a whole relationship
[00:48:16.240] 谢天谢地，那只是一段暧昧关系，我不用经历完整的恋爱过程。
[00:48:21.760]  to learn those lessons true true and I think it's like a perfect opportunity to
[00:48:21.760] 吸取这些教训，的确如此，我认为这就像一个绝佳的机会。
[00:48:28.240]  really focus on yourself after that like you know learn to have fun by yourself with your friends
[00:48:28.240] 之后真的要好好关注自己，比如学会和朋友们一起享受独处的时光。
[00:48:34.320]  and I think when you like you know learn to really trust yourself and feel good about yourself
[00:48:34.320] 我觉得当你学会真正信任自己，并对自己感觉良好的时候，你就会明白这一点。
[00:48:39.520]  then you know you can confidently enter new relationships and you know whether
[00:48:39.520] 这样你就能自信地进入新的恋情，也知道是否
[00:48:45.760]  that be something that's about to turn into a situation ship or not you will hopefully
[00:48:45.760] 不管那件事是否会演变成一场危机，你都希望如此。
[00:48:50.000]  have the trust and confidence in yourself to you know put down the communication draw the right
[00:48:50.000] 要对自己有信心，才能放下沟通，画出正确的图景。
[00:48:56.080]  boundaries and then prevent any further like terrible or toxic situations yeah definitely
[00:48:56.080] 划清界限，然后防止任何进一步的糟糕或有害的情况发生，是的，绝对要这样做。
[00:49:04.720]  I guess my advice is probably like very simple but I would say to enjoy it if there's one
[00:49:04.720] 我想我的建议可能很简单，但如果有这样的机会，那就好好享受吧。
[00:49:12.240]  benefit to a situation ship it's that it's can be very enjoyable and if you feel like at a
[00:49:12.240] 对一艘这样的船来说，好处在于它可以非常愉快，如果你觉得……
[00:49:18.400]  certain point it's no longer enjoyable or serving any of your interests then don't be afraid to walk
[00:49:18.400] 如果到了某个阶段，它不再让你感到快乐，或者不再符合你的任何兴趣，那么不要害怕离开。
[00:49:24.080]  away because at the end of the day just a situation ship no biggie he hasn't even met your friends yet
[00:49:24.080] 走开吧，说到底这只是个权宜之计，没什么大不了的，他甚至还没见过你的朋友呢。
[00:49:29.440]  so just be saddened just enjoy it and end it yeah enjoy it and then if you stop enjoying it
[00:49:29.440] 所以，就难过吧，好好享受，然后结束吧。好好享受，然后，如果你不再享受了。
[00:49:35.360]  then don't enjoy it then you run yeah hopping off of that I feel like if you are in a
[00:49:35.360] 如果你不喜欢它，那就跑吧，是的，从那上面跳下来，我觉得如果你在一个
[00:49:43.600]  situation ship I think the best thing you can do is be transparent and honest about what you want
[00:49:43.600] 我认为最好的办法就是坦诚地表达你的意愿。
[00:49:48.480]  and then if they don't they don't want the same thing that's totally okay then you can find someone
[00:49:48.480] 如果他们不想要同样的东西，那完全没问题，你可以去找其他人。
[00:49:52.720]  else who does want the same thing and also communication is key really if you're feeling
[00:49:52.720] 还有其他人也想要同样的东西，而且沟通对于任何有这种感觉的人来说都至关重要。
[00:49:58.000]  something just say it because at the end of the day worst thing they can do is not be on
[00:49:58.000] 随便说点什么吧，因为说到底，他们能做的最糟糕的事就是不在线。
[00:50:03.760]  the same page and if they're not on the same page then why do you want to take them
[00:50:03.760] 双方必须达成共识，如果他们没有达成共识，那你为什么要带他们去？
[00:50:06.880]  you know or why do you want to be with them well said and I think this is a very fun
[00:50:06.880] 你知道吗？或者说，你为什么想和他们在一起？说得好，我觉得这很有趣。
[00:50:11.040]  conversation it's always very interesting to pick each other's brains about various
[00:50:11.040] 交谈总是很有趣的，可以互相交流各种想法。
[00:50:17.760]  relationships that we've had and various thoughts and perspectives on on different situations so
