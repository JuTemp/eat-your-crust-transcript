[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:16.000]  So today we wanted to talk about what I think is very on topic for my day because I just went out last night
[00:00:16.000] 所以今天我们想聊聊我觉得很应景的话题，因为我昨晚刚出去玩了一晚上。
[00:00:30.000]  But we wanted to talk about partying responsibly and kind of surviving partying now that we're in our late 20s
[00:00:30.000] 但我们想谈谈如何负责任地参加派对，以及我们现在快30岁了，该如何才能在派对中保持身心健康。
[00:00:39.000]  Oh God, I feel so weird to say
[00:00:39.000] 天哪，我感觉说出来好奇怪
[00:00:42.000]  Dude, it's kind of scary
[00:00:42.000] 老兄，这有点吓人。
[00:00:43.000]  But the good part about being in our late 20s is we've had a lot of experience
[00:00:43.000] 但快三十岁的好处在于我们积累了很多经验。
[00:00:48.000]  indulging in late nights and things like that
[00:00:48.000] 沉迷于熬夜之类的事情
[00:00:51.000]  So then I feel like now I actually do have a routine that helps keep me alive
[00:00:51.000] 所以我觉得我现在确实有了一个能帮助我活下去的日常作息。
[00:00:57.000]  and minimizes hangovers and drunken mistakes
[00:00:57.000] 并最大限度地减少宿醉和醉酒失误
[00:01:02.000]  So today we're happy to share these things with you
[00:01:02.000] 所以今天我们很高兴与大家分享这些内容。
[00:01:04.000]  Share from our learning so hopefully we can prevent one or two hangovers from our listeners' lives
[00:01:04.000] 分享我们的学习经验，希望能帮助听众避免一两次宿醉的困扰。
[00:01:10.000]  Yeah
[00:01:10.000]  是的
[00:01:11.000]  Well, I will say the first and probably most common tip is always make sure to drink water
[00:01:11.000] 嗯，我要说的第一条也是最常见的建议就是：一定要多喝水。
[00:01:18.000]  Dude, this one seems so easy but I feel like sometimes it's really hard to remember and like keep up
[00:01:18.000] 老兄，这看起来很简单，但我觉得有时候真的很难记住，也很难跟上进度。
[00:01:25.000]  It kind of depends on the pace of the night but I feel like the nights where it's really chill and relaxed
[00:01:25.000] 这主要取决于当晚的节奏，但我感觉那些气氛特别轻松惬意的夜晚更是如此。
[00:01:31.000]  And everyone is kind of having a calm or time
[00:01:31.000] 大家都在享受一段平静的时光。
[00:01:34.000]  Then I feel like it's easier to remember to drink water
[00:01:34.000] 这样我就更容易记住喝水了。
[00:01:37.000]  But there are those nights where it's really fast paced maybe you're hopping from bar to bar
[00:01:37.000] 但有些晚上节奏很快，你可能要辗转于各个酒吧之间。
[00:01:41.000]  Then it's definitely hard to kind of keep up
[00:01:41.000] 那么，要跟上节奏就确实很难了。
[00:01:43.000]  True
[00:01:43.000]  真的
[00:01:44.000]  I've noticed also actually that if you're drinking stuff like celtzers or beer
[00:01:44.000] 我还注意到，如果你喝的是像凯尔特啤酒或啤酒之类的东西，也会有这种感觉。
[00:01:51.000]  their water content is higher versus like say a straight up shot
[00:01:51.000] 与直接射击相比，它们的含水量更高。
[00:01:57.000]  That water content is not as much so I've noticed that I actually stay more hydrated drinking celtzers and beer
[00:01:57.000] 因为含水量不高，所以我注意到喝凯尔特汽水和啤酒反而能让我保持更好的水分状态。
[00:02:04.000]  Even if I kind of forget to drink water in between
[00:02:04.000] 即使我有时会忘记在两餐之间喝水。
[00:02:07.000]  Yeah, that's a good point
[00:02:07.000] 没错，说得有道理。
[00:02:09.000]  I feel like it is kind of a double-edged sword sometimes though
[00:02:09.000] 我觉得这有时就像一把双刃剑。
[00:02:12.000]  Because celtzers and beer make me so bloated
[00:02:12.000] 因为凯尔特香肠和啤酒让我肚子胀得难受。
[00:02:15.000]  So whether or not I'm drinking water I'm probably constantly running to the bathroom to go pee
[00:02:15.000] 所以不管我喝不喝水，我可能都会不停地跑厕所小便。
[00:02:20.000]  So that it makes my brain think oh I'm keeping up with like my water intake
[00:02:20.000] 这样一来，我的大脑就会认为，哦，我的饮水量没超标。
[00:02:24.000]  When in actuality I've drunk like no water
[00:02:24.000] 但实际上我几乎没喝水。
[00:02:27.000]  That's true
[00:02:27.000]  这是真的
[00:02:28.000]  For instance like celtzers and shots I'm like okay yeah
[00:02:28.000] 例如像凯尔特啤酒和啤酒，我就觉得好吧，可以。
[00:02:30.000]  I need to like keep up with water otherwise I will die tomorrow
[00:02:30.000] 我得保持水分充足，不然明天就会死。
[00:02:33.000]  So I think I'm a little bit better about it
[00:02:33.000] 所以我觉得我的情况好多了。
[00:02:35.000]  Yeah, that's true because what is it like alcohol is a diuretic?
[00:02:35.000] 是的，没错，因为酒精不就是利尿剂吗？
[00:02:40.000]  I think that's what it's called
[00:02:40.000] 我想它就叫这个名字。
[00:02:41.000]  It basically makes you want to use the bathroom more
[00:02:41.000] 它基本上会让你更想上厕所。
[00:02:44.000]  So like even though you are drinking a lot of water content potentially
[00:02:44.000] 所以即使你喝了很多水，也可能仍然会有水含量下降。
[00:02:48.000]  You're peeing it out just as fast
[00:02:48.000] 你排出尿液的速度也一样快。
[00:02:51.000]  Yeah, and I don't know like this whole water thing
[00:02:51.000] 是啊，我也不知道这整个水的问题。
[00:02:54.000]  I've actually noticed that everyone's been getting a lot better about it
[00:02:54.000] 我注意到大家在这方面都进步了很多。
[00:02:58.000]  Because I'm sure we've all learned the same lessons as we're growing up together
[00:02:58.000] 因为我相信，在我们共同成长的过程中，我们都学到了同样的道理。
[00:03:02.000]  So recently a couple nights when we were drinking
[00:03:02.000] 最近几个晚上，我们喝酒的时候……
[00:03:06.000]  We would have a communal water cup
[00:03:06.000] 我们会共用一个水杯。
[00:03:09.000]  So then after each shot or after like a drinking game we would kind of pass it around
[00:03:09.000] 所以每次喝完一杯酒，或者玩完类似喝酒游戏之后，我们就会把酒传来传去。
[00:03:14.000]  And I feel like it really just takes one person to remember the water rule
[00:03:14.000] 我觉得其实只需要一个人记住水的规则就够了。
[00:03:18.000]  To keep everyone hydrated but I noticed that was like a huge help
[00:03:18.000] 为了让大家都能补充水分，我注意到这真的很有帮助。
[00:03:22.000]  Wow, yeah that sounds very helpful
[00:03:22.000] 哇，听起来很有帮助。
[00:03:25.000]  I've definitely encountered moments where it was like
[00:03:25.000] 我确实遇到过这样的时刻：
[00:03:28.000]  Oh don't forget to drink water and like oh yeah yeah yeah
[00:03:28.000] 哦，别忘了喝水，哦耶耶耶
[00:03:31.000]  And then I'm like wait
[00:03:31.000] 然后我就想，等等
[00:03:33.000]  Where is there even water?
[00:03:33.000] 哪里有水？
[00:03:35.000]  Yeah like if it's not in my hand I'm not gonna drink it
[00:03:35.000] 对，如果不在我手里，我就不会喝。
[00:03:38.000]  And then like the next second you're already moving on to something else
[00:03:38.000] 然后，下一秒你又开始做别的事情了。
[00:03:41.000]  You forget about the water
[00:03:41.000] 你忘记了水
[00:03:43.000]  Exactly
[00:03:43.000]  确切地
[00:03:45.000]  The other thing that I've tried in the past is
[00:03:45.000] 我过去尝试过的另一件事是
[00:03:48.000]  I feel like a lot of our friend groups we like playing drinking games
[00:03:48.000] 我觉得我们很多朋友圈都喜欢玩喝酒游戏。
[00:03:52.000]  And those are kind of the things that keep us really hyped up at night
[00:03:52.000] 而这些事情正是让我们晚上兴奋不已的原因。
[00:03:56.000]  A couple times
[00:03:56.000] 几次
[00:03:57.000]  I was like oh should we play this round with like water
[00:03:57.000] 我当时就想，哦，我们这轮要不要用水来玩？
[00:04:00.000]  Like water, rage cage or like water 7-11 doubles or something
[00:04:00.000] 就像水，愤怒笼子，或者像7-11便利店的双份水之类的
[00:04:05.000]  And I always get shot down but I still look you think that
[00:04:05.000] 我总是被拒绝，但我仍然会想，你觉得呢？
[00:04:08.000]  It might be a good idea
[00:04:08.000] 这或许是个好主意
[00:04:09.000]  Fun day
[00:04:09.000] 欢乐的一天
[00:04:10.000]  Oh my god yes, I think that's genius
[00:04:10.000] 我的天哪，没错，我觉得这真是天才之举。
[00:04:12.000]  Just like pause drinking for a second and everyone drink as much water as you possibly can while having fun
[00:04:12.000] 就像暂停喝水一会儿，然后大家尽可能多地喝水，同时享受乐趣一样。
[00:04:20.000]  Yeah exactly
[00:04:20.000] 对，没错。
[00:04:22.000]  And you can like target people to drink water in the games
[00:04:22.000] 你可以在游戏中定向引导人们喝水。
[00:04:25.000]  It's like there's so many genius ways to keep your friends hydrated
[00:04:25.000] 感觉有很多巧妙的方法可以让朋友们保持水分充足。
[00:04:29.000]  This doesn't happen as much nowadays
[00:04:29.000] 现在这种情况不常发生了。
[00:04:31.000]  But back when we were younger like maybe in college
[00:04:31.000] 但回想我们年轻的时候，比如大学时期。
[00:04:34.000]  It's always super funny when someone is like so drunk
[00:04:34.000] 看到有人喝得烂醉的样子总是超级搞笑。
[00:04:39.000]  That you are literally just feeding them water
[00:04:39.000] 你实际上只是在给他们喂水而已。
[00:04:42.000]  And they'll only take it if they think it's a shot of alcohol
[00:04:42.000] 他们只有在认为那是一杯酒的时候才会喝。
[00:04:45.000]  The classic yeah
[00:04:45.000] 经典的“是”
[00:04:47.000]  I've had the inverse happen to me as well
[00:04:47.000] 我也遇到过相反的情况。
[00:04:50.000]  Where I remember James was trying to feed me water
[00:04:50.000] 我记得当时詹姆斯正试图喂我喝水。
[00:04:53.000]  And I kept going like stop poisoning me
[00:04:53.000] 我继续说着，别再毒害我了。
[00:04:55.000]  I don't want to drink anymore alcohol
[00:04:55.000] 我不想再喝酒了。
[00:04:57.000]  Oh yeah
[00:04:57.000] 哦，是的
[00:04:58.000]  Because you lose your sense of trust
[00:04:58.000] 因为你失去了信任感
[00:05:01.000]  Last time they did this it was alcohol
[00:05:01.000] 他们上次这么做是因为喝酒。
[00:05:04.000]  But yeah I feel like that happens way less now
[00:05:04.000] 不过，我觉得现在这种情况发生的频率确实低了很多。
[00:05:08.000]  Now it's like we're all trustworthy
[00:05:08.000] 现在感觉我们所有人都值得信任了。
[00:05:10.000]  Oh this is actually water
[00:05:10.000] 哦，这其实是水。
[00:05:12.000]  Now we're all just like fighting for our lives
[00:05:12.000] 现在我们都像是在为生存而战。
[00:05:15.000]  Trying to survive
[00:05:15.000] 努力生存
[00:05:17.000]  Are there any other things that you do to help prevent potential hangovers?
[00:05:17.000] 你还会采取其他什么措施来预防宿醉吗？
[00:05:22.000]  I have one thing that I actually distinctly remember
[00:05:22.000] 我有一件事记得非常清楚。
[00:05:26.000]  Crystal you were the one who taught me this
[00:05:26.000] 克丽丝塔尔，是你教会了我这一切。
[00:05:29.000]  And it's actually to give yourself a little bit of room in between whatever you're drinking
[00:05:29.000] 实际上，这样做是为了在你喝任何东西之间留出一点空间。
[00:05:35.000]  I think especially in college days
[00:05:35.000] 我觉得尤其是在大学时期。
[00:05:38.000]  This was way worse now that we're all in our late 20s
[00:05:38.000] 现在我们都快30岁了，情况变得更糟了。
[00:05:41.000]  I feel like no one really does this as much anymore
[00:05:41.000] 我觉得现在很少有人再做这件事了。
[00:05:43.000]  But I remember back in college it truly was like every five minutes
[00:05:43.000] 但我记得大学的时候，真的几乎每五分钟就发生一次。
[00:05:47.000]  You were taking a shot with someone
[00:05:47.000] 你当时正和某人一起喝酒
[00:05:49.000]  And that obviously leads to crazy nights and crazy hangovers
[00:05:49.000] 这显然会导致疯狂的夜晚和严重的宿醉。
[00:05:54.000]  And I remember once you were like
[00:05:54.000] 我记得你曾经是这样的
[00:05:56.000]  And what I found really helpful is to just give yourself like a timer in between shots
[00:05:56.000] 我发现一个很有帮助的方法，就是在拍摄间隙给自己设定一个计时器。
[00:06:02.000]  So at least 15 minutes in between shots if not even more time
[00:06:02.000] 所以，拍摄间隙至少要间隔15分钟，甚至更长。
[00:06:06.000]  And if someone comes up to you and says
[00:06:06.000] 如果有人走过来对你说
[00:06:08.000]  Oh let's take a shot
[00:06:08.000] 哦，我们来试一试。
[00:06:09.000]  You just be like oh I already took one so give me like 10 minutes or 15 minutes
[00:06:09.000] 你就会说，哦，我已经吃过一次了，所以给我10分钟或15分钟吧。
[00:06:13.000]  And I remember at the time I was like
[00:06:13.000] 我记得当时我就想：
[00:06:15.000]  How can you just say like no to these people who are asking
[00:06:15.000] 你怎么能对这些提问的人说“不”呢？
[00:06:18.000]  Because as someone with social anxiety
[00:06:18.000] 因为我是一个有社交焦虑症的人
[00:06:20.000]  Like I find it really hard especially if it's someone I know not too well
[00:06:20.000] 我觉得这真的很难，尤其是如果对象是我不太熟悉的人。
[00:06:23.000]  But then the more I thought about it I was like that's genius
[00:06:23.000] 但后来我越想越觉得，这真是个天才的想法。
[00:06:26.000]  Because without those cadences you're like signing a death wish basically
[00:06:26.000] 因为如果没有那些节奏，你就相当于签了一份死亡遗嘱。
[00:06:31.000]  Oh my god yeah
[00:06:31.000] 我的天啊，是的
[00:06:32.000]  And usually when you say that it's not a no
[00:06:32.000] 通常情况下，当你这么说的时候，这并不是拒绝。
[00:06:34.000]  They'll be like oh right
[00:06:34.000] 他们会说，哦，对。
[00:06:35.000]  Okay yeah like I'll come find you in 10 minutes or so
[00:06:35.000] 好的，我大概十分钟后去找你。
[00:06:38.000]  Yeah and half the time they might not even remember
[00:06:38.000] 是啊，而且很多时候他们可能根本不记得了。
[00:06:41.000]  Yep so that's already a way
[00:06:41.000] 是的，那已经是一种方法了。
[00:06:43.000]  Look at my watch and be like
[00:06:43.000] 看看我的手表，然后说：
[00:06:45.000]  Oh um at like whatever o'clock you will come back
[00:06:45.000] 哦，嗯，大概几点你就会回来了。
[00:06:50.000]  Dude but it actually helps so much
[00:06:50.000] 老兄，但这真的很有帮助。
[00:06:52.000]  Because you're still like being fun
[00:06:52.000] 因为你仍然喜欢玩乐。
[00:06:54.000]  And there's like something you're waiting for
[00:06:54.000] 感觉就像你在等待着什么。
[00:06:58.000]  So then I feel like actually setting that time makes it a lot easier for me to adhere to that schedule
[00:06:58.000] 所以我觉得，设定好时间能让我更容易坚持这个作息时间表。
[00:07:03.000]  Yeah you're right I feel like I don't have to do that as much nowadays
[00:07:03.000] 是的，你说得对，我觉得我现在不需要像以前那样经常做那些事了。
[00:07:07.000]  But I definitely you know it was a signature move back in college
[00:07:07.000] 但我绝对知道，这可是我大学时期的标志性动作。
[00:07:10.000]  I feel like some preventative stuff that I do now
[00:07:10.000] 我觉得我现在做的一些预防措施很重要
[00:07:15.000]  I literally take like hangover prevention pills
[00:07:15.000] 我真的会吃一些预防宿醉的药。
[00:07:21.000]  So what I did before was there's this thing called Zbiotics
[00:07:21.000] 所以我之前做的是，有一种叫做Zbiotics的东西
[00:07:26.000]  And I heard from like some friends they're like oh if you get hangovers
[00:07:26.000] 我从一些朋友那里听说，他们会说，哦，如果你宿醉的话
[00:07:29.000]  This thing is supposed to help you
[00:07:29.000] 这东西应该对你有帮助
[00:07:31.000]  It's like some probiotic you take before you drink
[00:07:31.000] 就像喝水前服用的益生菌一样
[00:07:34.000]  And it helps break all the alcohol down while you drink
[00:07:34.000] 而且它还有助于在饮酒过程中分解酒精。
[00:07:37.000]  So I like bought some and I tried it out
[00:07:37.000] 所以我买了一些，然后试用了一下。
[00:07:39.000]  And I was like oh shoot I think it like kind of works
[00:07:39.000] 我当时就想，糟了，我觉得这好像有点用。
[00:07:42.000]  So if there's gonna be a big night ahead
[00:07:42.000] 所以，如果今晚注定是个大日子的话。
[00:07:45.000]  You know maybe it's someone's birthday or we're like really celebrating something
[00:07:45.000] 你知道，也许是某个人的生日，或者我们正在庆祝什么特别的事情。
[00:07:49.000]  I will make sure to like bring a Zbiotics for myself
[00:07:49.000] 我一定会给自己带一瓶Zbiotics。
[00:07:53.000]  But what I've discovered recently works even better is a combo
[00:07:53.000] 但我最近发现，一种组合方法效果更好：
[00:07:59.000]  So like Zbiotics and also all those supplements I guess like vitamins before you drink
[00:07:59.000] 就像Zbiotics，还有那些补充剂，比如喝饮料前吃的维生素之类的。
[00:08:07.000]  So I got these pills called purple pills and they're basically all the vitamins put into one pill
[00:08:07.000] 我买了一些叫紫色药丸的药片，它们基本上把所有维生素都浓缩在一颗药丸里了。
[00:08:14.000]  And so you take that before you drink
[00:08:14.000] 所以你要在喝酒前服用。
[00:08:16.000]  So that combo has like saved me a lot of times
[00:08:16.000] 所以这套组合救了我很多次。
[00:08:21.000]  Dude, I feel like the topic of supplements for drinking is so funny to me
[00:08:21.000] 老兄，我觉得关于饮酒补充剂的话题太搞笑了。
[00:08:26.000]  Like there's a couple iconic faces but I always think how would I pick up pre-drinking pills
[00:08:26.000] 虽然有一些标志性的面孔，但我总是在想，我该如何才能拿到预饮药呢？
[00:08:32.000]  But I've also taken like rabbit pellets is what my friend calls it
[00:08:32.000] 但我还吃过类似兔粮的东西，我朋友是这么称呼它的。
[00:08:37.000]  So those are I think like a Korean version of pills that help you break down the alcohol
[00:08:37.000] 所以我觉得那些应该是韩国版的解酒药吧。
[00:08:42.000]  And you take them before drinking or even at the end of your drinking to kind of help prevent hangovers
[00:08:42.000] 你可以在喝酒前服用，甚至在喝酒结束后服用，以帮助预防宿醉。
[00:08:47.000]  But all this stuff I think is a game changer
[00:08:47.000] 但我认为所有这些都将改变游戏规则。
[00:08:51.000]  Because when we went to Miami for my bachelor's last year
[00:08:51.000] 因为去年我去迈阿密读本科的时候……
[00:08:56.000]  A lot of the things on the itinerary involved alcohol in one way or another
[00:08:56.000] 行程安排中有很多项目都以某种方式与酒精有关。
[00:09:01.000]  And I took a Zbiotics before every single activity and I didn't nurse a hangover the entire trip
[00:09:01.000] 而且我每次活动前都会服用Zbiotics，结果整个旅程都没宿醉。
[00:09:07.000]  Which was just honestly like amazing and miraculous
[00:09:07.000] 这简直太神奇、太不可思议了。
[00:09:11.000]  That was my mistake. I was like dead and hungover for one of the days
[00:09:11.000] 那是我的错。有一天我简直像死了一样，宿醉未醒。
[00:09:16.000]  Because I forgot to pack my Zbiotics
[00:09:16.000] 因为我忘了带我的Zbiotics
[00:09:19.000]  Oh no!
[00:09:19.000] 哦不！
[00:09:20.000]  I think the only downside to Zbiotics though is that they can get really expensive
[00:09:20.000] 我认为Zbiotics唯一的缺点就是价格可能非常昂贵。
[00:09:26.000]  I think they were somewhere around 10 to 12 dollars a pop
[00:09:26.000] 我觉得它们大概每个10到12美元左右。
[00:09:31.000]  So it definitely adds up depending on how many times you take them
[00:09:31.000] 所以，服用次数越多，费用肯定会越高。
[00:09:35.000]  That's why I usually save them for like special occasions
[00:09:35.000] 所以，我通常只在特殊场合才穿它们。
[00:09:39.000]  But you're so right, I think the like drinking supplements is so funny
[00:09:39.000] 但你说得太对了，我觉得喝保健品这种事真的太搞笑了。
[00:09:44.000]  Because we have our one friend Tiffany who like before we even got into all of the you know like specialized pills
[00:09:44.000] 因为我们有个朋友蒂芙尼，在我们接触到所有你知道的那些特殊药丸之前……
[00:09:51.000]  Zbiotics or whatever every time we drink and we would be at her place
[00:09:51.000] 每次我们喝酒的时候都会喝Zbiotics之类的东西，而且我们都会去她家。
[00:09:56.000]  She would pull out this like box of just pills
[00:09:56.000] 她会拿出一个装满药片的盒子。
[00:09:59.000]  You know she like start handing them out like alright everyone get your B12 in you know
[00:09:59.000] 你知道她会开始分发这些东西，就像在说“好了，大家都来补充维生素B12吧”，你知道的。
[00:10:03.000]  This helps me like literally Costco size box
[00:10:03.000] 这对我来说简直就像好市多那种超大号的盒子一样方便。
[00:10:06.000]  Like this is gonna help for your water retention
[00:10:06.000] 这样应该有助于缓解你的水肿。
[00:10:09.000]  And we're taking like five pills and we're like okay
[00:10:09.000] 我们吃了五颗药，然后就觉得，好吧。
[00:10:13.000]  But they actually did help I think like most of the time we woke up the next morning
[00:10:13.000] 但我觉得它们确实起到了帮助作用，比如大多数时候我们第二天早上醒来的时候都是这样。
[00:10:17.000]  Like oh you know I don't feel too bad and then there's always the warning like
[00:10:17.000] 就像，你知道，我感觉还不错，但总会有警告，比如
[00:10:22.000]  Oh by the way when you take B12 your pee gets really yellow
[00:10:22.000] 对了，服用维生素B12后，你的尿液会变得很黄。
[00:10:26.000]  Oh god
[00:10:26.000] 我的天啊
[00:10:27.000]  So don't be just gonna say that too
[00:10:27.000] 所以别再这么说了。
[00:10:29.000]  Like don't be too alarmed it's just cuz the pill itself is you know high in whatever color
[00:10:29.000] 别太担心，只是因为药丸本身颜色比较深而已。
[00:10:34.000]  Right
[00:10:34.000]  正确的
[00:10:35.000]  Our other friend Jen I feel like she's the one who's iconically known for the rabbit pellets
[00:10:35.000] 我觉得我们另一个朋友珍才是真正以兔粮闻名的人。
[00:10:40.000]  And every time I drink with her at one point in the night
[00:10:40.000] 每次我和她一起喝酒，晚上总会有那么一刻。
[00:10:43.000]  She brings out the like Ziploc bag with like a billion rabbit pellets in it
[00:10:43.000] 她拿出一个像自封袋一样的袋子，里面装着好像数不清的兔粮。
[00:10:47.000]  She's like okay time to take our medicine
[00:10:47.000] 她说道：“好了，该吃药了。”
[00:10:49.000]  So I feel like there's just these friends who are known for their drinking supplements
[00:10:49.000] 我觉得我身边有些朋友特别喜欢喝保健品。
[00:10:53.000]  And every time you party with them
[00:10:53.000] 每次你和他们一起聚会
[00:10:55.000]  It helps
[00:10:55.000] 这很有帮助
[00:10:56.000]  And you know I definitely notice a difference
[00:10:56.000] 你知道，我确实感觉到了不同。
[00:10:58.000]  Yeah
[00:10:58.000]  是的
[00:10:59.000]  Thank you to them
[00:10:59.000] 谢谢他们
[00:11:00.000]  I know
[00:11:00.000]  我知道
[00:11:01.000]  Our supplement queen
[00:11:01.000] 我们的补品女王
[00:11:02.000]  Yeah
[00:11:02.000]  是的
[00:11:03.000]  You know also sometimes for these like hangover prevention stuff
[00:11:03.000] 你知道，有时候也会用到一些类似预防宿醉的东西。
[00:11:09.000]  I actually will get home
[00:11:09.000] 我真的会回家的
[00:11:11.000]  And then if I feel like I'm really fucked up
[00:11:11.000] 然后，如果我觉得自己真的糟透了
[00:11:15.000]  I will take some of it
[00:11:15.000] 我会拿走一些。
[00:11:17.000]  Mmm
[00:11:17.000] 嗯
[00:11:18.000]  When I remember I got home
[00:11:18.000] 当我记起我到家的时候
[00:11:20.000]  And I was like oh shoot this wasn't supposed to be like a crazy night
[00:11:20.000] 我当时就想，糟了，这晚上本来不应该这么疯狂的。
[00:11:23.000]  But I'm like kind of drunk
[00:11:23.000] 但我感觉有点醉了。
[00:11:25.000]  Like
[00:11:25.000]  喜欢
[00:11:26.000]  It's kind of bad and it's like late at night
[00:11:26.000] 情况有点糟糕，而且已经是深夜了。
[00:11:28.000]  So I dug out like a Z-biotics
[00:11:28.000] 所以我挖出了类似Z-biotics的东西
[00:11:30.000]  And I downed that
[00:11:30.000] 我把那杯喝光了。
[00:11:31.000]  And then I went to bed
[00:11:31.000] 然后我就去睡觉了。
[00:11:33.000]  And the next morning
[00:11:33.000] 第二天早上
[00:11:34.000]  I was like oh my god thank god
[00:11:34.000] 我当时想，哦我的天哪，感谢上帝
[00:11:36.000]  I like don't have hangover
[00:11:36.000] 我喜欢不宿醉。
[00:11:37.000]  I'm like somewhat alive
[00:11:37.000] 我感觉自己还活着。
[00:11:39.000]  Actually that's a really good point
[00:11:39.000] 这确实是一个很好的观点。
[00:11:40.000]  And I don't usually have like drinking supplements at my house unfortunately
[00:11:40.000] 而且很遗憾，我家通常不备喝营养补充剂之类的东西。
[00:11:46.000]  I should but I don't
[00:11:46.000] 我应该这么做，但我没有。
[00:11:47.000]  So my version of that is if I get home and I'm feeling really drunk
[00:11:47.000] 所以我的理解是，如果我回到家感觉喝得酩酊大醉。
[00:11:52.000]  That's like a sure sign that you'll be fucked up tomorrow
[00:11:52.000] 那简直就是你明天肯定倒霉透顶的预兆。
[00:11:55.000]  So then I always try to force myself to take like a bottle of liquid iv
[00:11:55.000] 所以我总是强迫自己喝下一瓶液体静脉注射液。
[00:12:00.000]  Or at least grab a bottle of water
[00:12:00.000] 或者至少拿瓶水。
[00:12:02.000]  And have it on the nightstand
[00:12:02.000] 把它放在床头柜上。
[00:12:03.000]  And just in case the next morning is kind of rough
[00:12:03.000] 万一第二天早上不太舒服呢
[00:12:06.000]  And I do feel like the nights where I go to sleep after
[00:12:06.000] 而且我感觉，那些晚上我睡着之后……
[00:12:09.000]  Trugging like a whole bottle of something helps a lot
[00:12:09.000] 像喝完一整瓶东西一样走来走去很有帮助。
[00:12:12.000]  Like I feel a lot less headache-y
[00:12:12.000] 感觉头痛减轻了很多。
[00:12:14.000]  Like I might still be a little nauseous in the morning
[00:12:14.000] 比如我早上可能还会有点恶心。
[00:12:16.000]  But the headache thing definitely helps a lot
[00:12:16.000] 但头痛确实很有帮助。
[00:12:18.000]  Oh my god yeah
[00:12:18.000] 我的天啊，是的
[00:12:19.000]  There's definitely been times where
[00:12:19.000] 确实有过这样的时刻：
[00:12:21.000]  Because I don't get the best sleep after drinking
[00:12:21.000] 因为我喝酒后睡眠质量不好。
[00:12:23.000]  So there's definitely been times
[00:12:23.000] 所以肯定有过这样的时期
[00:12:25.000]  Where I wake up at like an ungodly morning hour
[00:12:25.000] 我每天凌晨三四点就醒了。
[00:12:29.000]  Well ungodly to me
[00:12:29.000] 对我来说，这简直太不敬神了。
[00:12:32.000]  You're like 9-8
[00:12:32.000] 你就像9-8岁。
[00:12:35.000]  And then I'm like oh shoot, I'm like still drunk
[00:12:35.000] 然后我就想，糟了，我还没醒酒呢。
[00:12:37.000]  Or I'm still you know feeling kind of shitty
[00:12:37.000] 或者，你知道，我还是感觉很糟糕。
[00:12:39.000]  So I'll just chug hell of water
[00:12:39.000] 所以我就猛灌几口水吧
[00:12:41.000]  And then I'll go back to sleep
[00:12:41.000] 然后我就继续睡觉。
[00:12:43.000]  And when I wake up the next time I feel a lot better
[00:12:43.000] 下次醒来的时候，我感觉好多了。
[00:12:45.000]  Dude how was water just so like, keres all
[00:12:45.000] 老兄，水怎么就那么……呃，就这样？
[00:12:49.000]  Wait so powerful
[00:12:49.000] 等等，如此强大
[00:12:51.000]  And I feel like also too
[00:12:51.000] 我也觉得是这样。
[00:12:54.000]  Even if it doesn't completely cure your hangover
[00:12:54.000] 即使它不能完全治愈你的宿醉
[00:12:58.000]  The effect of having water in your system helps so much
[00:12:58.000] 体内有水对身体的益处非常大。
[00:13:01.000]  So in case you're feeling really nauseous
[00:13:01.000] 所以，如果你感到非常恶心的话
[00:13:03.000]  Then something comes up I feel like it's a lot smoother
[00:13:03.000] 然后出现了一些事情，我觉得一切都顺利多了。
[00:13:06.000]  And like less painful of an experience
[00:13:06.000] 而且痛苦感也会减轻。
[00:13:08.000]  If you're actually hydrated
[00:13:08.000] 如果你真的水分充足
[00:13:10.000]  Versus if you're completely dehydrated
[00:13:10.000] 而如果你完全脱水的话……
[00:13:12.000]  Then I feel like throwing up in the morning can be way more painful
[00:13:12.000] 然后我觉得早上呕吐会更痛苦。
[00:13:15.000]  Yeah
[00:13:15.000]  是的
[00:13:16.000]  Actually a tip that I've kind of picked up
[00:13:16.000] 其实这是我慢慢领悟到的一个小技巧
[00:13:18.000]  There are years of experience
[00:13:18.000] 拥有多年的经验
[00:13:21.000]  Is that if you feel really bad like you're about to throw up
[00:13:21.000] 如果你感觉非常难受，好像快要吐了，那就是这种情况。
[00:13:24.000]  You should pop a thumbs
[00:13:24.000] 你应该竖起大拇指
[00:13:26.000]  Because that will help neutralize the acidity that's about to come up
[00:13:26.000] 因为那样有助于中和即将产生的酸性物质。
[00:13:30.000]  So you'll feel better when you throw up
[00:13:30.000] 这样你呕吐后会感觉好些。
[00:13:34.000]  It won't burn your throw as much
[00:13:34.000] 它不会像其他投掷方式那样烧坏你的投掷物。
[00:13:36.000]  That's a really good tip
[00:13:36.000] 那真是个好建议
[00:13:38.000]  Sometimes you just can't help it
[00:13:38.000] 有时候你就是控制不住自己。
[00:13:40.000]  It's like the only thing that might help you feel better
[00:13:40.000] 这是唯一能让你感觉好些的东西。
[00:13:42.000]  Yeah
[00:13:42.000]  是的
[00:13:43.000]  Oh man
[00:13:43.000] 哦，天哪
[00:13:44.000]  But the good thing is I feel like nowadays
[00:13:44.000] 但好消息是，我觉得现在
[00:13:46.000]  We don't reach that point as often
[00:13:46.000] 我们并不经常达到那种程度。
[00:13:48.000]  You know like drinking to the point where we have to like throw up
[00:13:48.000] 你知道，就像喝到吐的那种程度。
[00:13:51.000]  Or like feel super shitty the next day
[00:13:51.000] 或者第二天感觉糟透了。
[00:13:53.000]  I think that's you know part of a part of getting older
[00:13:53.000] 我觉得这是变老的一部分吧。
[00:13:57.000]  I know it's grow
[00:13:57.000] 我知道它正在生长
[00:13:59.000]  And being more responsible
[00:13:59.000] 并且更加负责任
[00:14:03.000]  I think one of the things that's been helping lead to that too
[00:14:03.000] 我认为促成这种情况的原因之一也是
[00:14:07.000]  Is like there are certain things or certain factors that
[00:14:07.000] 就好像有一些事情或因素……
[00:14:11.000]  If I noticed them before a night out
[00:14:11.000] 如果我在晚上外出前注意到他们
[00:14:13.000]  Then it might lead to heavier drinking
[00:14:13.000] 那可能会导致饮酒量增加。
[00:14:15.000]  Or it might lead to a worse morning the next day
[00:14:15.000] 或者，这可能会导致第二天早上情况更糟。
[00:14:19.000]  So this is something that I feel like has made a big difference
[00:14:19.000] 所以我觉得这件事产生了很大的影响。
[00:14:23.000]  So one of the things that I always try to check now
[00:14:23.000] 所以，我现在总是会检查的事情之一就是
[00:14:25.000]  Is I need to have a completely honest vibe check with myself
[00:14:25.000] 我是否需要对自己进行一次完全诚实的自我感觉检查？
[00:14:29.000]  Before I go on a night out
[00:14:29.000] 在我晚上外出之前
[00:14:31.000]  And what that means is
[00:14:31.000] 这意味着什么呢？
[00:14:33.000]  If I'm like kind of in a bad mood
[00:14:33.000] 如果我心情不太好
[00:14:35.000]  Or I'm like feeling anxious about something
[00:14:35.000] 或者我感觉自己好像在为某件事感到焦虑。
[00:14:39.000]  Or there's something where I'm not completely comfortable
[00:14:39.000] 或者说，有些事情让我感到不太自在。
[00:14:42.000]  And like excited for the night out
[00:14:42.000] 就像对今晚的外出感到兴奋一样
[00:14:44.000]  Or if I'm too excited
[00:14:44.000] 或者如果我太兴奋了
[00:14:46.000]  Then I feel like the alcohol intake that night might get a little bit crazy
[00:14:46.000] 然后我觉得那天晚上我的酒量可能会有点失控。
[00:14:51.000]  In the sense where like I'm only drinking alcohol
[00:14:51.000] 就我而言，我只是在喝酒而已。
[00:14:54.000]  Not thinking about water and not constantly checking in with myself
[00:14:54.000] 不去想水，也不去不断地审视自己
[00:14:58.000]  But the nights where I'm comfortable
[00:14:58.000] 但那些夜晚，我感到很舒服。
[00:15:00.000]  And I'm like excited but not too excited
[00:15:00.000] 我既兴奋又没太兴奋。
[00:15:02.000]  You know things are looking good then usually
[00:15:02.000] 你知道，通常情况下，事情进展顺利。
[00:15:04.000]  I feel like it's way easier to control this level of drinking
[00:15:04.000] 我觉得这种饮酒量更容易控制。
[00:15:07.000]  So then now if I'm like
[00:15:07.000] 所以现在如果我像这样
[00:15:09.000]  Okay I might be kind of in a bad mood
[00:15:09.000] 好吧，我可能心情不太好。
[00:15:11.000]  Or like this might be kind of off
[00:15:11.000] 或者说，这可能有点不对劲
[00:15:13.000]  But let's say extra vigilant
[00:15:13.000] 但假设格外警惕
[00:15:15.000]  Really try to make sure that I'm vibes checking myself all night
[00:15:15.000] 我真的会努力整晚都注意自己的状态。
[00:15:20.000]  Otherwise it won't lead to like a good amount of drinking i think
[00:15:20.000] 否则我觉得就不会导致喝很多酒了。
[00:15:24.000]  That's very diligent of you I think
[00:15:24.000] 我觉得你真是太勤奋了。
[00:15:27.000]  Because you're right, I think
[00:15:27.000] 因为你说得对，我想
[00:15:30.000]  In times where maybe you're kind of stressed out
[00:15:30.000] 当你感到压力很大的时候
[00:15:33.000]  Or something upsetting happened during the day
[00:15:33.000] 或者白天发生了什么令人不快的事情。
[00:15:36.000]  It's so easy to be like
[00:15:36.000] 成为那样的人太容易了。
[00:15:38.000]  tonight like fucking I'm just gonna you know go hard and like drink my worries away.
[00:15:38.000] 今晚我他妈的就要放纵一下，把烦恼都喝光。
[00:15:44.560]  I've definitely had that feeling before too so I like that you just double check with yourself
[00:15:44.560] 我以前也有过这种感觉，所以我很赞同你这种自我确认的方式。
[00:15:49.440]  you're like okay I'm feeling this way today so let's keep it real to him or whatever.
[00:15:49.440] 你会想，好吧，我今天感觉就是这样，所以我们就对他坦诚一点吧。
[00:15:55.280]  Yeah I feel like it's especially on those days where I'm looking for some kind of crutch
[00:15:55.280] 是啊，我觉得尤其是在我需要某种依靠的时候。
[00:15:59.920]  and then if alcohol is there as a potential then recently I've been thinking like maybe I should
[00:15:59.920] 如果酒精也是一种潜在的诱惑，那么最近我一直在想，也许我应该
[00:16:04.080]  just dd on those days and then that way it's truly like I can go and vibe and hang out
[00:16:04.080] 那些日子就只做日常琐事，这样我才能真正放松下来，享受和朋友们一起玩的时光。
[00:16:09.360]  and maybe relax a little bit but I'm still gonna have to drive home so I won't drink really.
[00:16:09.360] 或许可以稍微放松一下，但我还得开车回家，所以不会真的喝酒。
[00:16:14.080]  Wow very responsible.
[00:16:14.080] 哇，非常负责。
[00:16:18.480]  Originally when you mentioned the vibe check I was thinking in my head you know how sometimes
[00:16:18.480] 最初你提到氛围测试的时候，我脑子里想的是，你知道，有时候
[00:16:24.000]  in the middle of partying or the evening or whatever you need to go the bathroom and you have a
[00:16:24.000] 在聚会、晚上或其他任何场合，你突然想上厕所，而你……
[00:16:29.440]  moment like looking at yourself and then be heard and you're like am I good right now?
[00:16:29.440] 就像审视自己，然后被倾听，你会想：我现在状态好吗？
[00:16:34.960]  Wait oh my god the immediate it's like a sobriety check that's like the true test when you sit down
[00:16:34.960] 等等，我的天哪，这感觉就像是即时的清醒度测试，这才是真正的考验，当你坐下来的时候。
[00:16:41.200]  you're like I feel woozy and then yeah it's like the mid game checkup or whatever.
[00:16:41.200] 你会感觉头晕目眩，然后就像比赛中途的检查之类的。
[00:16:48.480]  And then you're like okay I'm like a little drunk right now I should tone it down so that I can
[00:16:48.480] 然后你就会想，好吧，我现在有点醉了，我应该收敛一点，这样我才能……
[00:16:53.440]  have a good night's rest tonight.
[00:16:53.440] 今晚好好休息。
[00:16:56.800]  That's a good point though I feel like those are really true checkpoints for yourself throughout the
[00:16:56.800] 你说得对，我觉得这些确实是你在整个过程中需要不断检查的关键节点。
[00:17:00.960]  night of like am I well like should I do I need to do I need to stop or am I good to continue?
[00:17:00.960] 今晚我感觉怎么样？我该怎么做？我需要做什么？我需要停下来吗？还是我可以继续？
[00:17:07.200]  Seriously are there any other like checkups that you do for yourself?
[00:17:07.200] 说真的，你还会给自己做其他类似的体检吗？
[00:17:12.640]  So this is something that I feel like I can be kind of bad at but this truly clues me in on whether
[00:17:12.640] 所以我觉得我在这方面可能不太擅长，但这确实让我明白了……
[00:17:19.280]  tomorrow is gonna be a rough or not.
[00:17:19.280] 明天要么会很艰难，要么不会。
[00:17:20.960]  I feel like on the nights where I'm checking my phone decent amount checking the time making
[00:17:20.960] 我觉得在那些晚上，我频繁查看手机，主要是查看时间。
[00:17:26.000]  sure that it's not too late or anything usually I'll be fine the next day but there's certain
[00:17:26.000] 我确定现在还不算太晚，通常我第二天就没事了，但有些情况确实存在。
[00:17:31.360]  nights where the time just completely escapes you and you check your phone and it's like 8 p.m.
[00:17:31.360] 有些夜晚，时间完全悄然流逝，你查看手机时，已经是晚上 8 点了。
[00:17:36.800]  and then the next time you check your phone it's like 2 a.m.
[00:17:36.800] 然后你下次查看手机的时候，已经是凌晨2点了。
[00:17:39.120]  Oh god those are truly the nights I'm like okay yeah tomorrow's gonna actually suck.
[00:17:39.120] 天哪，那些夜晚我真的会觉得，好吧，明天肯定糟透了。
[00:17:43.840]  You're like wait what happened to all those hours?
[00:17:43.840] 你会想：等等，那些时间都去哪儿了？
[00:17:46.160]  Yeah that's so funny but honestly it's a pretty good indicator it makes sense when you say it
[00:17:46.160] 是啊，这太搞笑了，但说实话，这确实能很好地说明你说得有道理。
[00:17:52.880]  because it's kind of like how aware are you of making these little checks in the middle versus
[00:17:52.880] 因为这有点像你对中间这些小检查的意识程度，与……相比。
[00:17:59.840]  like everything's just out the window okay I have a maybe it's like kind of graphic but
[00:17:59.840] 感觉一切都毁了，好吧，我可能有点儿形象，但是
[00:18:07.840]  I feel like for me it helps a lot is I kind of keep track of my p color throughout the night.
[00:18:07.840] 我觉得对我来说，整晚留意我的孕酮颜色变化很有帮助。
[00:18:16.320]  Wait what I'm intrigued.
[00:18:16.320] 等等，什么？我很好奇。
[00:18:19.040]  You know the more hydrated you are usually the more clear your p is so I keep track of how yellow
[00:18:19.040] 你知道，通常情况下，身体水分越多，尿液就越清澈，所以我一直留意尿液的黄色程度。
[00:18:26.880]  I guess or clear my p is throughout the evening and I think it kind of helps give a general sense
[00:18:26.880] 我猜或者说，我整个晚上都在努力让自己清醒过来，我觉得这有助于给人一种大致的感觉。
[00:18:33.680]  of am I hydrated or not? That's a really good way to check because you always kind of look when you
[00:18:33.680] 我是否水分充足？这是一个很好的检查方法，因为你总会在……的时候留意观察。
[00:18:39.920]  see the data is there so I've been kind of doing that more often because you always have to go
[00:18:39.920] 数据就在那里，所以我最近经常这样做，因为你总是需要去查看数据。
[00:18:49.280]  the bathroom right so I might as well check as you said the data is there I might as well harvest it.
[00:18:49.280] 浴室就在那儿，所以我不妨去看看，正如你所说，数据就在那里，我不妨把它收集起来。
[00:18:58.480]  I like that though because the starting point is like oh how often am I drinking water and then
[00:18:58.480] 我喜欢这种方式，因为它的出发点是“哦，我多久喝一次水？”
[00:19:03.040]  you do like the double check of am I actually staying hydrated enough? Yeah so that's how I've kind
[00:19:03.040] 你喜欢反复确认自己是否真的喝够了水吗？是的，所以我就这么做了。
[00:19:08.480]  of noticed that like cellars and beers these things that are a little more high in water content
[00:19:08.480] 我注意到，就像酒窖和啤酒一样，这些东西的含水量略高。
[00:19:15.360]  versus other alcoholic drinks it like keeps me hydrated because when I go to the bathroom I'm like
[00:19:15.360] 与其他酒精饮料相比，它能让我保持水分，因为我去洗手间的时候会感觉……
[00:19:20.160]  oh my p is like very clear. That's hilarious honestly I feel like it's also so funny because
[00:19:20.160] 哦，我的天，这太清晰了。说真的，这太搞笑了，我觉得这也很有趣，因为
[00:19:28.640]  all these little checks and like all these little things kind of point to how many rough mornings
[00:19:28.640] 所有这些小检查，以及所有这些小事，都指向了有多少个艰难的早晨。
[00:19:33.680]  we've had in the past that like lead us to do all these checks now or like we can't have another
[00:19:33.680] 我们过去也遇到过类似的情况，导致我们现在不得不进行所有这些检查，或者说我们不能再有第二次机会了。
[00:19:38.400]  morning like this anymore. Literally last night I went to the bathroom at one point and I was like
[00:19:38.400] 以后再也不想早上都这样了。昨晚我去洗手间的时候，突然就想：
[00:19:43.520]  oh shoot my piece like a little yellow when we get back I'm gonna need to chuck some water.
[00:19:43.520] 哦，我们回去的时候，我得像个小黄人一样射我的子弹，我得喝点水才行。
[00:19:49.680]  I feel like also what I've started doing is usually when I go to sleep and I'm feeling really drunk
[00:19:49.680] 我觉得我最近开始做的一件事，通常是在我睡着的时候，而且我感觉自己喝得酩酊大醉。
[00:19:56.320]  by the time I fall asleep it'll give me like some sort of hangover the next day so I'll like always
[00:19:56.320] 等我睡着的时候，第二天就会感觉像宿醉一样，所以我总是会……
[00:20:02.160]  try to check in with myself right before I sleep and see where I'm at just so I can like mentally
[00:20:02.160] 我会在睡前试着审视一下自己的状态，看看自己处于什么状态，这样我才能保持良好的心理状态。
[00:20:06.800]  prepare and for the most part if I'm doing that check I'll be fine the next day but if I don't do
[00:20:06.800] 做好准备，如果我做了检查，第二天通常就没问题；但如果我不做检查，那就可能出现问题。
[00:20:12.000]  that check in with myself then I know it's gonna be a little bit rough. Yeah I think I sometimes
[00:20:12.000] 我这样问自己，就知道接下来可能会有点难熬。是啊，我觉得我有时候
[00:20:18.560]  if I am feeling pretty drunk still I'll try to like stay up for a little bit. I don't know what
[00:20:18.560] 如果我感觉还很醉，我会尽量再熬一会儿。我不知道什么
[00:20:25.280]  the science is behind this maybe like it gives your body more time to process or something
[00:20:25.280] 这背后的科学原理可能是，它可以给你的身体更多的时间来处理之类的。
[00:20:30.560]  but I feel like it does help a little bit. I think it does too and I feel like if you don't do
[00:20:30.560] 但我感觉它确实有点帮助。我也这么认为，而且我觉得如果你不这样做的话……
[00:20:36.160]  that then what you mentioned earlier happens where you wake up still feeling drunk and you're kind of
[00:20:36.160] 然后就会发生你之前提到的那种情况，你醒来后仍然感觉醉醺醺的，而且有点……
[00:20:40.640]  like um I feel okay and then you like pass out again and then you wake up again at like one
[00:20:40.640] 感觉还行，然后就又昏过去了，然后又在凌晨一点左右醒了过来。
[00:20:44.720]  pm and you're definitely not okay. Yeah okay also I feel like having responsibilities the next day
[00:20:44.720] 下午，你肯定不太舒服。嗯，好吧，而且我觉得第二天还有责任要承担。
[00:20:52.160]  is usually really good at keeping me in check as well so if I know I can't sleep in the next day
[00:20:52.160] 它通常也能很好地督促我，所以如果我知道第二天不能睡懒觉的话
[00:20:59.120]  because I need to to like recover properly then in the back of my mind I'm always like okay I have
[00:20:59.120] 因为我需要好好恢复，所以我心里总会想，好吧，我还有
[00:21:05.120]  like responsibilities tomorrow. I can't like I can't just go crazy. Yeah that's a good point although
[00:21:05.120] 比如明天还有责任要承担。我不能，我不能就这么疯掉。嗯，你说得对，虽然
[00:21:11.920]  I think it can be a double edge sword where sometimes the things happen or the night escapes you
[00:21:11.920] 我觉得这可能是一把双刃剑，有时候事情会发生，或者夜晚悄然流逝。
[00:21:17.840]  and then you're just in between a rock and a hard place the next day. Yes that's very true. Like for
[00:21:17.840] 然后第二天你就进退两难了。没错，确实如此。点赞
[00:21:22.560]  example today we literally woke up at 9 a.m. to record. I think I texted you at like 855 where
[00:21:22.560] 举个例子，今天我们早上9点就起床录音了。我记得我大概8点55分给你发了短信。
[00:21:30.320]  I was like oh god I'm like just crawling out of bed. I pushed your back like 10 minutes.
[00:21:30.320] 我当时就想，天哪，我简直是从床上爬起来的。我推了你背大概10分钟。
[00:21:37.760]  I think last night you were like oh I'm out celebrating something and then I texted you like
[00:21:37.760] 我觉得昨晚你好像在说“哦，我出去庆祝什么事了”，然后我给你发了条短信，就像
[00:21:42.160]  are we gonna make the night again tomorrow? I remember I was like yeah like I'm keeping my
[00:21:42.160] 我们明天晚上还要再来一次吗？我记得我当时说，是啊，我得继续保持下去。
[00:21:48.240]  drinking and check as I'm like drinking a fat glass of wine. Hey this is late 20s life. This
[00:21:48.240] 边喝边看，就像喝一大杯葡萄酒一样。嘿，这就是二十多岁的生活。
[00:21:54.640]  is true responsibility us recording this on 9 a.m. oh my god yeah college me could never
[00:21:54.640] 真正的责任就是让我们在早上9点录制这段视频。我的天哪，大学时的我绝对做不到。
[00:22:02.880]  so earlier you mentioned for you losing track of time is a signal that you might be hung over the
[00:22:02.880] 所以你之前提到过，对你来说，失去时间感可能意味着你宿醉了。
[00:22:09.520]  next day. I kind of thought about it and I think for me when I have those face-to-face with myself
[00:22:09.520] 第二天。我仔细想了想，我觉得对我来说，当我与自己面对面时……
[00:22:17.040]  in the mirror and I look at myself and I'm like oh I'm like kind of drunk that's like a sign
[00:22:17.040] 我对着镜子看着自己，心想：哦，我好像有点醉了，这就像个征兆。
[00:22:26.240]  that I might be fucked up the next morning. Oh my god dude been there truly. It's like there's
[00:22:26.240] 我感觉第二天早上可能会很痛苦。我的天啊兄弟，我真的懂。感觉就像……
[00:22:33.840]  like a level two right you're like oh I am at the level where I might not be okay tomorrow morning.
[00:22:33.840] 就像到了二级水平，你会想，哦，我已经到了明天早上可能就没事的程度了。
[00:22:39.440]  Yeah I think the beginning stages of when I know I'm like really buzz is when I look at myself
[00:22:39.440] 是的，我觉得当我审视自己时，我意识到自己真正进入状态的最初阶段就是……
[00:22:44.400]  in the mirror and I'm just like captivated by my own beauty. Because when you're like
[00:22:44.400] 照镜子的时候，我完全被自己的美貌迷住了。因为当你……
[00:22:48.640]  inebriated. I'm just like oh my god like I look great and that's like the start. And then the
[00:22:48.640] 我喝醉了。我当时就想，我的天哪，我看起来棒极了，这大概就是一切的开始。然后……
[00:22:54.720]  end point is like when you're almost having like a conversation with yourself in the mirror. Yes
[00:22:54.720] 最终状态就像你对着镜子和自己对话一样。是的。
[00:22:59.920]  yes you get together. You're like okay put on a straight face and get back out there.
[00:22:59.920] 是的，你们聚在一起。你会想，好吧，振作起来，继续前进。
[00:23:06.640]  Yeah like your own coach. I think also a bad sign for me is if I think back on the evening and
[00:23:06.640] 对，就像你自己的教练一样。我觉得对我来说，另一个不好的迹象是，如果我回想起那个晚上……
[00:23:15.920]  I always had a drink in my hand. Oh that's a good point. Then I'm like oh whether it was intentional
[00:23:15.920] 我手里总是拿着饮料。哦，这说得对。然后我就想，哦，这是不是故意的？
[00:23:22.080]  or not I was probably drinking the entire time even if it was just like sips and that adds up
[00:23:22.080] 或者我可能全程都在喝酒，即使只是小口啜饮，积少成多也会导致饮酒量增加。
[00:23:28.160]  and I'll probably be unwell the next day. Dude and on top of that night's where I look back and
[00:23:28.160] 我第二天可能就会不舒服。老兄，而且那天晚上发生的事让我回想起……
[00:23:34.720]  I'm like oh shit I probably should have eaten more for dinner or something. That is always going
[00:23:34.720] 我心想，糟了，我晚饭可能应该多吃点什么的。这种情况总是发生。
[00:23:39.520]  to be a sign that you might have a hangover because I feel like if you don't have much food in
[00:23:39.520] 这可能是宿醉的征兆，因为我觉得如果你没吃多少东西……
[00:23:44.800]  your stomach or the type of food you had was super light or something like that then even if you
[00:23:44.800] 如果你的胃或者你吃的食物特别清淡之类的，即使你
[00:23:49.360]  drink a little bit or like a half a couple of drinks like it'll really shake my system. That's so
[00:23:49.360] 喝一点点，或者半杯、两杯之类的，好像这样就能让我的身体彻底垮掉。真是的。
[00:23:55.040]  true. It's always very important to eat beforehand. So this kind of reminds me of one of the nights on our
[00:23:55.040] 没错。提前吃点东西总是很重要的。这让我想起了我们……的某个晚上。
[00:24:02.400]  bachelor's at trip last year where the venue was supposed to be dinner and drinks. And I was
[00:24:02.400] 去年我参加了一次单身派对旅行，原计划是举办晚宴和酒会。而我当时……
[00:24:07.840]  kind of like oh you order for yourself. I'm going to just like the welcome night so it was like a very
[00:24:07.840] 有点像，哦，你自己点餐。我只是想参加欢迎晚会，感觉就像非常
[00:24:12.640]  chill and casual environment. So we were like standing around a pool at like standing tables
[00:24:12.640] 环境轻松休闲。我们当时就围坐在泳池边，坐在类似站立式桌子旁。
[00:24:18.000]  when it wasn't really like a true sit down and like waiter experience. So then naturally I feel
[00:24:18.000] 因为这根本不像一次真正的坐下来用餐、享受服务员服务的体验。所以，我自然而然地会觉得
[00:24:23.680]  like a lot of us devolved more onto like the drinking side than the eating side and then I know
[00:24:23.680] 就像我们很多人一样，我们越来越沉迷于喝酒而不是吃饭，然后我知道
[00:24:29.680]  we had some like casualties from that night and I look back and I'm just like yeah that's truly
[00:24:29.680] 那天晚上我们有一些伤亡，现在回想起来，我只能说，是啊，那真是……
[00:24:35.760]  like what happens when everyone is really excited and it's not like a sit down dinner kind of a venue.
[00:24:35.760] 就像大家都很兴奋，但又不是那种可以坐下来吃顿饭的正式场合一样。
[00:24:41.680]  Yeah to be fair they also served us the alcohol first and I think a lot of us were like empty
[00:24:41.680] 说实话，他们先给我们上了酒，我觉得我们很多人都已经喝光了。
[00:24:47.440]  stomachs like we just got there earlier like a couple hours ago so we're like okay I guess
[00:24:47.440] 感觉肚子有点胀，就像我们几个小时前刚到那里一样，所以我们就想，好吧，我想
[00:24:52.400]  I'll have some drinks. And I feel like if you look at the menu or like the yellow it doesn't seem
[00:24:52.400] 我喝点东西。我觉得如果你看菜单或者喜欢黄色调，可能感觉不到什么。
[00:24:58.080]  like that kind of plays it kind of does seem like a sit down and eat sort of play so we were
[00:24:58.080] 那种类型的戏剧，感觉就像是那种可以坐下来吃顿饭的戏剧，所以我们……
[00:25:02.320]  definitely baited into having some unfortunate decisions. Yeah we ended up drinking a decent amount.
[00:25:02.320] 确实被诱导做出了一些不明智的决定。是的，我们最后喝了不少酒。
[00:25:07.920]  Yeah I remember they served us these giant punch bowls and yes at first like when you drink
[00:25:07.920] 对，我记得他们给我们上了那种超大的潘趣酒碗，没错，一开始就像你喝酒的时候
[00:25:12.960]  it you're like oh okay like it's not too bad it tastes good but then later into the evening it was
[00:25:12.960] 你会觉得，哦，还行，味道不错，但到了晚上就……
[00:25:17.840]  like oh wait I'm like kind of fucked up. Dude actually that brings up such a good point.
[00:25:17.840] 哦等等，我感觉自己有点儿糟糕。兄弟，你说的确实很有道理。
[00:25:25.440]  Sometimes I think about if alcohol tastes too good or you don't taste the alcohol enough in it
[00:25:25.440] 有时候我会想，酒的味道是不是太好喝了，或者根本尝不出酒味。
[00:25:31.600]  that'll really fuck people up so like in college I think the biggest perpetrator was jungle juice
[00:25:31.600] 那玩意儿真的会把人害惨，所以我觉得大学里最大的罪魁祸首就是丛林果汁。
[00:25:37.680]  in adulthood. I've had some experiences with like so many towers where it's like the soju and
[00:25:37.680] 成年后，我经历过很多类似烧酒塔的事情，就像……
[00:25:43.600]  the beer and it just tastes like beer but it's way stronger things like that are always step traps.
[00:25:43.600] 这啤酒尝起来就像啤酒，但酒精度要高得多。诸如此类的东西总是陷阱。
[00:25:48.960]  So sometimes I'm like maybe the alcohol we're drinking needs to like actually taste like shit.
[00:25:48.960] 所以有时候我会想，也许我们喝的酒应该真的难喝得像屎一样。
[00:25:55.520]  No you're so right it's so dangerous when the alcohol tastes good.
[00:25:55.520] 没错，你说得太对了，酒如果味道好，那就太危险了。
[00:26:01.440]  Okay that's why I think celtzers are like quietly very dangerous because if you get a box of
[00:26:01.440] 好吧，这就是为什么我认为凯尔特人其实非常危险，因为如果你买到一盒……
[00:26:07.840]  like tasty celtzers you know you kind of rip through those pretty quickly.
[00:26:07.840] 就像美味的凯尔特香肠一样，你知道，你会很快把它们吃光。
[00:26:12.400]  I feel like the one good thing about celters though is that if they're super carbonated you get
[00:26:12.400] 我觉得芹菜根唯一的好处就是，如果它们碳酸化程度很高，你就能得到
[00:26:16.880]  so bloated that like basically it's impossible to drink anymore. True but another death trap thing
[00:26:16.880] 胀得厉害，基本上喝不了水了。确实如此，但这又是另一个死亡陷阱。
[00:26:23.520]  that I can think of is when someone compliments you too much slash challenges you to drink.
[00:26:23.520] 我能想到的一个例子是，当有人过度赞美你，或者怂恿你喝酒的时候。
[00:26:30.560]  Oh man. I feel like that it's never a good idea and I've learned my lesson on like never speak
[00:26:30.560] 哎呀。我觉得那样做肯定不是个好主意，我已经吸取教训了，以后最好别再说了。
[00:26:36.160]  those words of like this person as good as you like literally never say that because you're setting
[00:26:36.160] 那些说“这个人跟你一样好”之类的话，千万别说出口，因为你是在给自己设限。
[00:26:41.360]  them up for failure essentially. Yes yes. I think that was a very common thing that happened to me
[00:26:41.360] 基本上就是让他们注定失败。没错没错。我觉得这事儿发生在我身上很常见。
[00:26:47.920]  in college where people would be like oh shoot like crystal can drink a lot actually and then
[00:26:47.920] 在大学里，人们会说，哦，天哪，克里斯托尔其实很能喝，然后
[00:26:52.800]  people would be like oh she can drink a lot then she'll be able to like you know take shots with
[00:26:52.800] 人们会说，哦，她酒量很好，那她就能像……你知道的，一口闷了。
[00:26:56.320]  us and all right and then you like you know you end up dying. Yeah I don't know if any college
[00:26:56.320] 我们，好吧，然后你知道，最后你会死。是啊，我不知道有没有大学
[00:27:04.240]  students listen to this but if you do listen to this then I would say that's the one reputation
[00:27:04.240] 学生们会听这个，但如果你听了，那我想说，这就是声誉所在。
[00:27:08.880]  you do not want to have in college. Yeah because you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
[00:27:08.880] 你不想在大学里经历这些。是啊，因为无论你选择做还是不做，都会受到指责。
[00:27:13.840]  exactly so always pretend like you can't drink even if you can't. Yeah stumble a little bit you
[00:27:13.840] 没错，所以即使你喝不了，也要装作喝不了的样子。嗯，稍微踉跄一下。
[00:27:20.880]  know put on the act like oh no I'm so drunk exactly. Okay Loki though I feel like people who get
[00:27:20.880] 我知道要装作一副“哦不，我喝醉了”的样子，没错。好吧，洛基，我觉得那些……
[00:27:27.280]  red get like Asian glow there's a benefit there because then they're like oh yeah like I'm so
[00:27:27.280] 红润的肤色会像亚洲人那样容光焕发，这其实是有好处的，因为这样她们就会说：“哦，对啊，我好漂亮！”
[00:27:33.760]  fucked up look how red I am. That's a good point actually just like physically you're like oh maybe
[00:27:33.760] 糟了，你看我脸红成什么样了。确实，你说得对，就像从外表上看，你会觉得“哦，也许吧”。
[00:27:41.200]  this person is not as well but in reality they might be fine. A person with no Asian glow might be
[00:27:41.200] 这个人看起来不太好，但实际上可能没事。一个没有亚洲人特有的气色的人可能……
[00:27:48.160]  fucked up. It's funny because like me and you we don't really get Asian glow but our boy friends do
[00:27:48.160] 真糟糕。这很搞笑，因为像你我这样的人其实没有亚洲人特有的那种红润气色，但我们的男朋友却有。
[00:27:57.840]  and then I say oh like these two are fine and we're like oh no we're not fine.
[00:27:57.840] 然后我说，哦，好像这两个人没事似的，但我们却说，哦不，我们一点也不好。
[00:28:04.240]  But yeah actually Asian glow is a really funny thing too because you and I both don't get it we
[00:28:04.240] 但其实“亚洲红晕”也挺有意思的，因为你我都不太理解。
[00:28:08.800]  don't fully understand or know the perspective of people with Asian glow but I remember once
[00:28:08.800] 我并不完全理解或了解亚洲人那种红润的感受，但我记得曾经
[00:28:13.840]  I was traveling in Asia with a couple of friends who do get it and they were like I've never felt so
[00:28:13.840] 我和几个能理解这种感受的朋友一起在亚洲旅行，他们说：“我从来没有过这种感觉。”
[00:28:19.440]  at home like I feel so safe going out at night and drinking because everyone else at the bar looks
[00:28:19.440] 在家的时候我觉得很安全，晚上出去喝酒也很放心，因为酒吧里其他人看起来都很自信。
[00:28:25.360]  less well than me. They're with their people yeah well aside from hangover prevention is there
[00:28:25.360] 比我情况差。他们和他们的人在一起，是啊，除了预防宿醉之外还有什么？
[00:28:33.520]  anything that you do or take note of that really kind of signals you'll have a good night?
[00:28:33.520] 你做的或注意的哪些事情，真的能预示你今晚会过得愉快吗？
[00:28:39.840]  So I think the first thing is what I mentioned earlier which was don't go into nights out when you're
[00:28:39.840] 所以我觉得第一点就是我之前提到的，那就是不要在晚上出去玩。
[00:28:45.280]  in a bad mood because that might lead you to not have a really good gauge on how you're feeling and
[00:28:45.280] 心情不好可能会导致你无法准确判断自己的感受，
[00:28:51.840]  whatnot but I feel like another thing too is to kind of lean into what you're feeling on a night out.
[00:28:51.840] 等等，但我感觉还有一点就是，在晚上外出时，要顺其自然，感受自己的情绪。
[00:28:59.520]  So what I mean by that is even if you're not drunk or like even if you feel completely sober
[00:28:59.520] 我的意思是，即使你没喝醉，或者即使你感觉完全清醒……
[00:29:06.560]  I feel like if you pretend you're more drunk than you are then one you'll drink less and two
[00:29:06.560] 我觉得如果你假装自己比实际醉得多，那么第一，你会喝得更少；第二，
[00:29:11.520]  you'll have a really good time and it sounds kind of stupid but I feel like if you lean into that
[00:29:11.520] 你会玩得很开心，这听起来有点傻，但我觉得如果你顺其自然的话……
[00:29:16.240]  feeling a little bit more instead of waiting for it to actually feel that way then you can kind of
[00:29:16.240] 与其等待那种感觉真正到来，不如先感受一下，这样你就能……
[00:29:22.560]  set yourself up to have a good time because that's really the point of going out you know having these
[00:29:22.560] 让自己玩得开心，因为这才是外出玩乐的真正意义所在，你知道，就是享受这些。
[00:29:27.040]  nights is just have a good time. True I think like the power of the mind is so easy to forget about
[00:29:27.040] 夜晚就是尽情享受。确实，我觉得精神的力量很容易被遗忘。
[00:29:33.920]  sometimes it's really like making sure you're staying in a positive mindset and like positive mind
[00:29:33.920] 有时候，保持积极的心态真的很重要。
[00:29:40.800]  space. Yeah I totally agree and I feel like there's been nights where sometimes it gets into
[00:29:40.800] 空间。是的，我完全同意，我觉得有些夜晚，有时候会变得很空虚。
[00:29:48.000]  something like really serious and people like start to open up about their feelings and stuff
[00:29:48.000] 事情变得非常严重，人们开始敞开心扉谈论自己的感受等等。
[00:29:53.440]  and I feel like those nights actually do have a special place in my heart too just because
[00:29:53.440] 我觉得那些夜晚在我心中也确实有着特殊的地位，就因为
[00:29:57.920]  everyone opens up and you have really raw and honest conversations with your friends that you might
[00:29:57.920] 每个人都敞开心扉，你会和朋友们进行非常坦诚和真挚的对话，你可能会……
[00:30:03.040]  not otherwise but I feel like at the core of it it still needs to be positive. Yeah and
[00:30:03.040] 并非如此，但我感觉它的核心仍然需要是积极的。是的。
[00:30:09.280]  needs to be like a good and enjoyable experience for you to open up and say these things instead
[00:30:09.280] 你需要把它当作一次美好而愉快的经历，才能敞开心扉说出这些话。
[00:30:14.320]  of a completely sad and like down-trodden night basically. Yeah I think that's also like you want to
[00:30:14.320] 基本上就是一个完全悲伤、令人沮丧的夜晚。是啊，我觉得那也是你想要的那种感觉。
[00:30:19.920]  make sure you're with people that you love and trust too. I think that also helps with the vibes
[00:30:19.920] 确保和自己爱和信任的人在一起。我觉得这也有助于营造氛围。
[00:30:27.040]  overall because yeah like you said you're just you're out here having a good time with friends.
[00:30:27.040] 总的来说，就像你说的，你只是和朋友们在这里玩得很开心。
[00:30:33.440]  I could totally imagine being with people maybe more strangers or people that make you nervous
[00:30:33.440] 我完全可以想象和陌生人或者让你紧张的人在一起。
[00:30:39.920]  then you end up not having a great time because you're always like on guard or something like that.
[00:30:39.920] 这样一来，你最终反而玩得不尽兴，因为你总是处于戒备状态之类的。
[00:30:44.560]  Totally and I guess the last thing that I can think of is the buddy system. I feel like it's
[00:30:44.560] 完全同意，我想最后要提到的就是结对互助制度。我觉得这……
[00:30:50.560]  always such a good way to make sure that you and all of your friends are gonna have a good time and
[00:30:50.560] 这始终是确保你和你的所有朋友都能玩得开心的好方法，
[00:30:56.160]  not a painful time so if you're going to grab some water make sure your friends are drinking water.
[00:30:56.160] 现在情况并不糟糕，所以如果你要喝水，请确保你的朋友们也在喝水。
[00:31:01.920]  Don't go to like strange places by yourself just always make sure that you and your friends are safe.
[00:31:01.920] 不要独自去陌生的地方，一定要确保你和朋友的安全。
[00:31:07.760]  I feel like that truly increases like the longevity of your friendships and like the wellness of
[00:31:07.760] 我觉得这确实能延长友谊的寿命，也能提升幸福感。
[00:31:12.400]  your friends as well. Oh my god that actually reminds me the buddy system it's okay to like leave
[00:31:12.400] 你的朋友也一样。我的天，这让我想起了结伴而行的那种方式，可以随时离开。
[00:31:19.120]  early too. If that's gonna make you feel better then you should just leave early even better if you
[00:31:19.120] 早点走也行。如果那样能让你感觉好些，那你最好早点走，如果你……
[00:31:24.160]  can like grab a friend if you don't want to like leave alone right be like hey are you also trying
[00:31:24.160] 如果你不想一个人待着，可以找个朋友一起，比如问问她：“嘿，你也想试试吗？”
[00:31:28.480]  to leave chances are your friend is also trying to leave. They're like oh thank god like someone finally
[00:31:28.480] 你要离开，很可能你的朋友也想离开。他们会想：谢天谢地，终于有人走了。
[00:31:35.920]  asked me to leave. That's true actually completely agree and I feel like truly at the core of it
[00:31:35.920] 他们让我离开。确实如此，我完全同意，而且我觉得这才是问题的核心所在。
[00:31:43.040]  is like don't feel obligated to like do stuff or stay or you know I feel like people feel so much
[00:31:43.040] 就好像，不要觉得有义务去做某件事或者留下来，你知道，我觉得人们感受太多了。
[00:31:48.960]  responsibility but at the end of the day it's just like a night out and it's fine to leave early
[00:31:48.960] 虽然有责任，但说到底这就像一次外出聚会，提前离开也没什么大不了的。
[00:31:53.440]  it's fine to put yourself first. It's fine to like vibe check and if the vibe check fails then you
[00:31:53.440] 把自己的需求放在第一位是可以的。喜欢氛围测试也是可以的，如果氛围测试失败了，那么……
[00:31:57.760]  can just head home and make sure that you have a good time and everyone else also has good energy.
[00:31:57.760] 你可以直接回家，确保自己玩得开心，也确保其他人都精神饱满。
[00:32:03.120]  Definitely like save your mental dude yeah this is late 20s learning.
[00:32:03.120] 绝对要保护好你的精神状态，伙计，这可是快30岁的人才需要学习的东西。
[00:32:09.920]  Do seriously because I feel like when we're younger maybe there was like I don't know maybe a
[00:32:09.920] 认真点，因为我觉得当我们年轻的时候，也许会……我不知道，也许是……
[00:32:14.800]  sense of FOMO or you know something there that kind of kept us in these situations when we clearly
[00:32:14.800] 害怕错过机会的感觉，或者你知道的，某种让我们明明身处这种境地却仍然深陷其中的情绪。
[00:32:21.920]  wanted to go home. Right no totally and I feel like there was a lot more peer pressure back then
[00:32:21.920] 想回家。没错，完全没问题，而且我觉得那时候的同辈压力比现在大得多。
[00:32:28.880]  and I used to think that term was so like dumb because you know how in those like dare commercials
[00:32:28.880] 我以前觉得这个词特别蠢，因为你知道，在那些“敢于挑战”之类的广告里……
[00:32:33.520]  or whatever peer pressure always came in the form of like some scary looking person being like you
[00:32:33.520] 或者说，同辈压力总是以某种形式出现，比如某个看起来很可怕的人像你一样。
[00:32:37.600]  have to do this or all or something bad will happen but I feel like truly in college like peer
[00:32:37.600] 我必须这么做，否则会发生不好的事情，但我感觉自己真的像大学里的同龄人一样。
[00:32:42.880]  pressure does not look like that. Peer pressure is like your friend being like oh you want something
[00:32:42.880] 压力并非如此。同侪压力就像你的朋友会说：“哦，你想要什么？”
[00:32:46.720]  and then you just internally put expectations on yourself sort of but now that we're feeling a
[00:32:46.720] 然后你就会在内心给自己设定一些期望，但现在我们感觉……
[00:32:52.240]  little bit more steady in terms of how confident we feel about ourselves you know where it maybe
[00:32:52.240] 就我们对自己自信的程度而言，可能稍微稳定一些。
[00:32:57.440]  able to gauge what we want better now I feel like peer pressure is not as big of a deal anymore.
[00:32:57.440] 我现在更能准确判断自己想要什么，我觉得同辈压力不再那么重要了。
[00:33:03.520]  Yeah definitely. I think we all have learned to like respect each other's boundaries more
[00:33:03.520] 是的，当然。我觉得我们都学会了更加尊重彼此的界限。
[00:33:09.840]  and respect when we put ourselves first too because no one wants anyone to like go home in a bad
[00:33:09.840] 当我们优先考虑自身利益时，也要尊重他人，因为没有人希望任何人带着糟糕的心情回家。
[00:33:16.240]  state everyone wants people to get home safely we're always like oh my god make sure you text us
[00:33:16.240] 大家都希望大家安全回家，我们总是说“我的天哪，一定要给我们发短信”。
[00:33:21.120]  when you get home like get back safely and we always double check with everyone like oh are you
[00:33:21.120] 当你到家的时候，比如“安全到家”，我们总是会跟每个人确认一下，比如“哦，你安全吗？”
[00:33:25.520]  good to drive you know all that stuff so maybe that is character growth for all of us.
[00:33:25.520] 开车的感觉很好，你知道的，诸如此类的事情，所以也许这对我们所有人来说都是一种性格成长。
[00:33:30.320]  True now or just like we're totally prioritizing everyone's well-being.
[00:33:30.320] 现在是这样吗？或者说，我们真的把每个人的福祉放在首位吗？
[00:33:36.640]  It's been a cool transition to see and plus we've suffered enough I think in past years.
[00:33:36.640] 看到这样的转变令人欣喜，而且我觉得过去几年我们已经遭受了太多苦难。
[00:33:42.000]  I guess to be fair also in college a lot of times at least for our experience these events or
[00:33:42.000] 我想公平地说，在大学里，至少就我们的经验而言，很多时候也会发生这些事件或
[00:33:48.800]  whatever were like house parties who we were already close to home but now it's like we're living
[00:33:48.800] 以前我们经常在家聚会，离家很近，但现在感觉就像我们住在……
[00:33:54.400]  in the Bay and not everyone is each other's neighbors you know sometimes we have to drive like 30
[00:33:54.400] 在湾区，并不是每个人都是邻居，你知道，有时候我们得开车30英里。
[00:33:59.920]  minutes plus to get home so we're all like okay make sure you're safe first and foremost
[00:33:59.920] 还有几分钟就到家了，所以我们都说，好吧，首先确保你的安全。
[00:34:06.080]  and then do whatever you need to do. Definitely I think the DD system is at full works
[00:34:06.080] 然后做你需要做的任何事。我绝对认为直接借记系统已经全面运转。
[00:34:11.680]  whenever we have these nights so it's been really great to see. So I feel like everything we
[00:34:11.680] 每当我们一起度过这些夜晚，看到这些真的太棒了。我觉得我们所做的一切都很有意义。
[00:34:16.640]  just said points to heavy growth and yeah some wholesome vibes but the reality is sometimes even
[00:34:16.640] 刚才说的都指向快速增长，而且确实有一些积极向上的氛围，但现实有时甚至……
[00:34:23.520]  now in our late 20s you slip up and you have a morning where you do have a hangover so what do
[00:34:23.520] 现在我们快30岁了，难免会犯错，第二天早上醒来会宿醉，那该怎么办呢？
[00:34:30.000]  your hangovers kind of look like Crystal and what are some ways that you've learned help really
[00:34:30.000] 你的宿醉看起来有点像Crystal，你有什么有效的缓解方法吗？
[00:34:34.480]  combat that hangover. Oh man. So one thing that's interesting is like media always portrays hangovers
[00:34:34.480] 对抗宿醉。哎呀。有一点很有意思，媒体总是把宿醉描绘成……
[00:34:44.160]  as like you're sensitive to light you have a headache all that kind of stuff but my hangovers
[00:34:44.160] 就像你对光线敏感，你会头痛等等，但我的宿醉……
[00:34:49.600]  aren't quite like that. Minor probably mainly some nausea and like feeling really really weak
[00:34:49.600] 不太像那样。可能只是轻微的恶心和感觉非常虚弱。
[00:34:57.680]  and just feeling bad in general. I don't know if I necessarily get like sensitivity to light that much
[00:34:57.680] 而且感觉整体状态都不太好。我不知道自己是不是对光线特别敏感。
[00:35:06.160]  but I just want to like sleep all day and I'm like so dead no energy feel really bad. Sometimes it's
[00:35:06.160] 但我只想睡一整天，感觉精疲力竭，一点力气都没有，心情很糟糕。有时候是这样。
[00:35:14.640]  so bad that I can't even keep anything down like I would want to throw up if I ate any food or drink
[00:35:14.640] 情况糟透了，我什么都吃不下，吃一点东西或喝一点水都会想吐。
[00:35:20.720]  too much water. So I kind of just suffer through it for however many hours but I'm usually fine by
[00:35:20.720] 水喝太多了。所以我只能硬撑几个小时，但通常都没什么事。
[00:35:28.080]  5pm. Dude the 5pm rule like Crystal's 5pm rule is so funny because we've done a lot of traveling
[00:35:28.080] 下午5点。老兄，像Crystal的下午5点规则那样的规则真的太搞笑了，因为我们经常旅行。
[00:35:36.800]  and like trips together and most notably I think like a year ago we went to Austin on a girl trip.
[00:35:36.800] 我们还一起旅行，最值得一提的是，大概一年前我们一起去奥斯汀进行了一次女生旅行。
[00:35:42.720]  There was one day where we kind of drink a lot and then a couple of us were hungover
[00:35:42.720] 有一天我们喝了很多酒，结果我们当中有几个人宿醉了。
[00:35:47.520]  and literally like until 5pm Crystal was like the walking bed and then literally the second
[00:35:47.520] 一直到下午5点，Crystal 就像个行走的病床，然后……
[00:35:53.920]  after 5pm struck Crystal was completely fine and like normally you would be like what the fuck?
[00:35:53.920] 下午5点过后，Crystal 完全没事，像往常一样，你可能会想：这到底是怎么回事？
[00:36:02.800]  Yeah we ended up going out again like you know that night and I was like oh okay it's after
[00:36:02.800] 是啊，那天晚上我们又出去了，你知道的，然后我就想，哦，好吧，那是之后
[00:36:07.680]  5pm I can make it. Oh my god but I think my hangovers are somewhat similar to yours. I don't have
[00:36:07.680] 下午5点我可以到。天哪，我觉得我的宿醉症状跟你有点像。我没有
[00:36:16.240]  like a specific time where I suddenly feel better but I definitely do kind of lay in bed and like
[00:36:16.240] 就像某个特定的时间，我突然感觉好多了，但我肯定还是会躺在床上，然后……
[00:36:22.960]  suffer quietly. I feel like some of the best stuff that has helped me though is having like a soda.
[00:36:22.960] 默默忍受吧。不过我觉得对我帮助最大的东西之一就是喝汽水。
[00:36:31.760]  Having like a ice cold lemon lime spray always really helps. Something about like the
[00:36:31.760] 喷点冰镇柠檬青柠喷雾真的很有帮助。感觉就像……
[00:36:38.000]  fizziness I think helps settle my stomach a little bit. Sometimes after a night out I feel like you
[00:36:38.000] 我觉得气泡饮料能稍微缓解我的胃部不适。有时候晚上出去玩了一晚上之后，我会感觉像你
[00:36:43.040]  get like a kind of gross taste in your mouth and like in your system where you're just like oh I
[00:36:43.040] 嘴里会涌起一种恶心的味道，感觉整个身体都像被掏空了一样，你会想：哦，我
[00:36:47.360]  feel like every time I breathe I can taste the alcohol so having something really sweet also helps
[00:36:47.360] 感觉每次呼吸都能尝到酒味，所以吃点甜的东西也很有帮助。
[00:36:53.040]  take that taste away and kind of freshen up my system. I heard that ginger ale is also nice too
[00:36:53.040] 去掉那股味道，让我的身体清爽一下。我听说姜汁汽水也不错。
[00:36:58.960]  because ginger sometimes helps with like nausea but yes I've definitely heard that tip but you know
[00:36:58.960] 因为生姜有时能缓解恶心之类的症状，没错，我确实听说过这个方法，但你知道的。
[00:37:05.680]  sometimes I can't stomach it or just like the thought of eating or you know consuming stuff and
[00:37:05.680] 有时候我就是吃不下，或者只是不喜欢想到要吃东西，你知道，就是不想摄入那些东西。
[00:37:10.720]  I'm sure this isn't helping either because you know I'm sure actually consuming something will help
[00:37:10.720] 我相信这样做也无济于事，因为你知道，我相信实际摄入一些东西肯定会有帮助。
[00:37:16.160]  my body have energy but I'm just like I can't right now. Dude and the struggle is like to eat
[00:37:16.160] 我身体有精力，但我现在就是做不到。唉，这种挣扎就像吃饭一样。
[00:37:22.960]  something usually you have to like sit up and I feel like sitting up is like one of the biggest
[00:37:22.960] 通常你需要坐起来，我觉得坐起来是其中最重要的事情之一。
[00:37:28.240]  challenges of hangover days. Oh my god so for me sometimes it's a 50-50 like sometimes it feels
[00:37:28.240] 宿醉的挑战。我的天哪，对我来说，有时候感觉五五开，有时候感觉……
[00:37:34.080]  worse to lie down sometimes it feels worse to sit up. So one time in college I remember I got really
[00:37:34.080] 有时候躺下更糟，有时候坐着更糟。我记得大学的时候有一次，我真的……
[00:37:39.840]  I was like super hungover and I couldn't lie down like it made me feel so nauseous so I just like
[00:37:39.840] 我当时宿醉得厉害，躺下都躺不下来，感觉恶心想吐，所以我就……
[00:37:46.080]  sat on my bed and I leaned against the wall and I like slept that way. Oh my god the things we do
[00:37:46.080] 我坐在床上，靠着墙，就那样睡着了。天哪，我们做了这么多事。
[00:37:54.320]  to like not feel unwell. Oh man it's truly a struggle. So recently I was nursing like a mild
[00:37:54.320] 不想感觉不舒服。哎，真是太难了。最近我一直在哺乳，感觉像个轻度婴儿。
[00:38:01.920]  hangover and then we were hanging out with some of our friends and our friend was like I heard
[00:38:01.920] 宿醉之后，我们和一些朋友一起玩，然后我的朋友说，我听说
[00:38:07.760]  you're actually supposed to like work out through a hangover like I heard if you sweat it makes
[00:38:07.760] 听说宿醉的时候应该坚持锻炼，出汗的话会感觉更好。
[00:38:12.160]  you feel a lot better and I was like how am I supposed to work out when I can't even do not lie
[00:38:12.160] 你感觉好多了，我就想，我连锻炼都做不到，怎么锻炼啊？（我可没撒谎）
[00:38:16.960]  down. Like lie down is the only way I could survive the day. Dude okay you know the Korean reality show
[00:38:16.960] 躺下。躺下好像是我活下去的唯一方法。哥们，你知道那个韩国真人秀吧。
[00:38:24.000]  I live alone so I was watching an episode one time one of the like panelists or one of the like
[00:38:24.000] 我一个人住，所以有一次我在看一集节目，其中一个嘉宾或者其他什么人……
[00:38:31.440]  main characters I guess on the show she hosts a lot of parties and so the episode I watched she
[00:38:31.440] 我猜她是剧中的主角，她在剧中经常举办派对，所以我看的这集里……
[00:38:37.200]  hosted a party and then the next morning she was like kind of hungover. She literally put on
[00:38:37.200] 她办了个派对，第二天早上就有点宿醉。她简直是装出来的。
[00:38:42.800]  like some zoom-up video or something and started jumping around like crazy and working out and I was
[00:38:42.800] 就像看了个放大视频似的，然后就开始疯狂地蹦蹦跳跳，跟着视频里的动作锻炼，我当时
[00:38:47.840]  like dude how is she doing this and then afterwards she was like oh yes I sweat I feel so much better now
[00:38:47.840] 我当时就想，老兄，她是怎么做到的？然后事后她说，哦，是的，我出汗了，我现在感觉好多了。
[00:38:53.040]  and I was like wow that is just absurd I don't have that kind of energy. I mean I'm sure there's
[00:38:53.040] 我当时就想，哇，这太荒谬了，我可没那么多精力。我的意思是，我确信肯定有……
[00:39:00.320]  some sort of validity to that because I do feel like after I take a really hot shower. Oh yeah
[00:39:00.320] 这似乎有点道理，因为我洗完热水澡后确实感觉很舒服。哦，是的。
[00:39:05.760]  I feel so much better and maybe part of it is like your pores are opening up and like the toxins
[00:39:05.760] 我感觉好多了，也许部分原因是毛孔张开了，毒素也排出来了。
[00:39:10.640]  are getting slid out through a really hot shower but it's just getting there is just so hard.
[00:39:10.640] 就像要通过滚烫的淋浴喷头冲出去一样，但到达那里的过程却如此艰难。
[00:39:16.240]  It really is. I commend people who are able to do that. Yes totally. I could never.
[00:39:16.240] 确实如此。我佩服那些能做到这一点的人。没错，完全可以。我永远也做不到。
[00:39:25.680]  Well that was fun and very as I said on topic for me after surviving a night out and waking
[00:39:25.680] 嗯，这很有趣，而且正如我所说，对我来说非常切题，因为我熬过了一夜狂欢，醒来后……
[00:39:34.160]  up so early to record this podcast. The best part is I'm not even hungover. I'm just like kind
[00:39:34.160] 为了录这个播客，我一大早就起来了。最棒的是我一点宿醉的感觉都没有。我感觉就像……
[00:39:39.520]  of tired because we have to wake up early and I think that is true character growth.
