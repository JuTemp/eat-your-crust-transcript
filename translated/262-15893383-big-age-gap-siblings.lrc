[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Destin.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Destin。
[00:00:17.300] Welcome back, Destin. Last episode we had Destin on was episode 215, where he talks about
[00:00:17.300] 欢迎回来，德斯汀。我们上次请到德斯汀是在第215期节目中，他在那期节目中谈到了……
[00:00:23.900] his tattoo apprenticeship. And now Destin is a fully fledged tattoo artist, which is very cool to see.
[00:00:23.900] 他完成了纹身学徒生涯。现在，德斯汀已经是一名正式的纹身艺术家了，这真是太酷了。
[00:00:31.100] But we actually brought Destin on this week to talk about big age gaps in siblings. This is
[00:00:31.100] 但我们本周请来德斯汀是为了谈谈兄弟姐妹之间年龄差距过大的问题。
[00:00:37.560] something that Jeesoo and I both do not have any experience with. So we thought it would be fun
[00:00:37.560] 我和Jeesoo都对这方面完全没有经验，所以我们觉得会很有趣。
[00:00:43.080] to pick your brain a little bit and confirm or question any theories that we personally have.
[00:00:43.080] 想请教您一些问题，以确认或质疑我们个人的一些想法。
[00:00:52.300] Right. Jeesoo is a single child, right? And then you are a youngest child. Yeah.
[00:00:52.300] 对。智秀是独生子，对吧？那你是最小的孩子。嗯。
[00:00:57.780] Yeah, I can tell. I can tell. But yes, please, I would love to answer any questions you guys have.
[00:00:57.780] 是的，我看得出来。我看得出来。不过，我很乐意回答你们的任何问题。
[00:01:04.840] So maybe Destin, you can give a little bit of background for our listeners who don't know you.
[00:01:04.840] 德斯汀，或许你可以为不认识你的听众简单介绍一下自己。
[00:01:10.780] Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with your siblings, as well as the different age
[00:01:10.780] 你能谈谈你和兄弟姐妹的关系，以及你们年龄上的差异吗？
[00:01:16.500] gaps that you have with them? Right now I'm 28 years old. I have a younger brother who is 24.
[00:01:16.500] 你和他们之间有什么差距吗？我现在28岁，我有个弟弟，他24岁。
[00:01:25.160] Then I have a younger half sister who is 14 years younger than me. So they are 14 right now. And
[00:01:25.160] 我还有一个同父异母的妹妹，比我小14岁。所以她们现在都是14岁。
[00:01:34.160] they do go by they them, even though they are my sister. It's pretty interesting. You know,
[00:01:34.160] 她们都用“她们”这个称呼，尽管她们是我妹妹。这挺有意思的。你知道吗？
[00:01:39.920] I'm sure Crystal remembers a lot when we were growing up in high school, like probably meeting
[00:01:39.920] 我相信克丽丝塔尔一定记得我们高中时期的许多往事，比如我们初次见面的时候。
[00:01:44.540] my sister. It's like kind of interesting. I feel like when you go to your friend's house
[00:01:44.540] 我姐姐。这挺有意思的。感觉就像你去朋友家一样。
[00:01:48.940] during like high school, you don't expect to be in like a baby environment. You know what I mean?
[00:01:48.940] 高中时期，你不会希望自己身处一个像婴儿一样的环境。你明白我的意思吗？
[00:01:53.960] Yeah.
[00:01:53.960] 是的。
[00:01:54.420] But yeah, like it was pretty interesting, especially when we were doing a lot of events for
[00:01:54.420] 不过，确实挺有意思的，特别是当我们举办很多活动的时候。
[00:01:58.040] high school. And people would like come over and work on stuff at my house, like school projects or
[00:01:58.040] 高中。人们会来我家一起做事情，比如学校项目之类的。
[00:02:03.500] just, you know, homecoming stuff. There would just be a baby around. It was just like it just adds a
[00:02:03.500] 你知道，就是那种返校节之类的场合。会有个婴儿在场。感觉就像是增添了一份特别的氛围。
[00:02:08.120] little bit of like chaos.
[00:02:08.120] 有点像混乱。
[00:02:09.840] Oh my god, definitely. And it's crazy too, because your little sister, if they're 14 years younger,
[00:02:09.840] 我的天哪，绝对是。而且这也很疯狂，因为你的妹妹，如果她们比你小14岁，
[00:02:17.440] then that means they're about 14 years old now. And when we first met them, they were really young.
[00:02:17.440] 那也就是说他们现在大概14岁了。我们第一次见到他们的时候，他们还很小。
[00:02:25.020] Yeah, still in like diapers. Barely conscious.
[00:02:25.020] 是啊，还穿着尿布呢。意识模糊。
[00:02:29.420] Yeah, exactly. Like they didn't even speak full sentences yet at some point. So to think that
[00:02:29.420] 对，没错。感觉他们一度甚至都说不出完整的句子。所以想想看……
[00:02:35.020] they're just walking the earth right now capable of forming sentences is crazy.
[00:02:35.020] 他们现在就能行走于世，还能说出完整的句子，这简直太不可思议了。
[00:02:40.400] Yeah. I mean, it's pretty interesting to think about it now because, you know, when you guys met
[00:02:40.400] 是啊。我的意思是，现在想想这件事挺有意思的，因为，你知道，你们俩相遇的时候。
[00:02:44.920] them, we were like in high school and now they're a sophomore in high school right now. So I think it's
[00:02:44.920] 我们认识他们的时候，他们还在上高中，现在他们都上高二了。所以我觉得……
[00:02:50.840] pretty interesting kind of like the cycle and kind of seeing them because literally today they just
[00:02:50.840] 挺有意思的，有点像这种循环，而且能看到它们，因为今天它们就……
[00:02:55.820] had their sophomore homecoming day. Oh my god. So talking about homecoming is kind of like on topic
[00:02:55.820] 他们办了大二返校节。我的天哪。所以聊返校节好像也算是顺便提一下话题了。
[00:03:02.180] right now. So if you were 14, when your sister was born, then you were like a fully conscious person.
[00:03:02.180] 现在就是这样。所以，如果你妹妹出生时你14岁，那么你当时就已经是一个完全有意识的人了。
[00:03:09.940] And I say that because when your brother was born, you were like four, which I feel like is a little bit
[00:03:09.940] 我说这话是因为你弟弟出生时你才四岁，我觉得这有点……
[00:03:15.820] young to be like fully sentient and making conscious active decisions. So do you think being
[00:03:15.820] 年轻的时候就像完全有感知能力，能够做出有意识的主动决定。那么你认为年轻是……
[00:03:21.620] a full fledged 14 year old when your sister was born changes the dynamic that you have with them
[00:03:21.620] 当你妹妹出生时你已经14岁了，这会改变你和他们之间的关系。
[00:03:26.560] versus with your brother? Were you more of an active participant in your relationship with your
[00:03:26.560] 与你和你兄弟的关系相比呢？你在和你的兄弟的关系中是否更积极主动？
[00:03:32.100] sister versus your brother? Yeah, I feel like four year age gap is pretty normal sibling age gap.
[00:03:32.100] 妹妹和弟弟？嗯，我觉得四岁的年龄差算是很正常的兄妹年龄差了。
[00:03:37.760] So I feel like you kind of just are like kids together, you know, you're kind of like just doing
[00:03:37.760] 所以我觉得你们就像一群孩子在一起，你知道，你们就像在做……
[00:03:42.360] dumb stuff, beating each other up, especially when you're like brothers and just like hit each other.
[00:03:42.360] 一些愚蠢的事情，比如互相殴打，尤其是像兄弟一样的人，就会互相打闹。
[00:03:47.600] I definitely feel like it's different when the age gap is so different because
[00:03:47.600] 我觉得年龄差距这么大的时候，情况肯定会不一样，因为
[00:03:52.020] definitely you can't be like giving them like knuckle sandwiches and stuff, you know,
[00:03:52.020] 你肯定不能像打拳头之类的，你知道的。
[00:03:58.260] you know, they can't fight back. No, I'm just kidding. But you watch them as like a baby and you know,
[00:03:58.260] 你知道，他们没法反抗。不，我开玩笑的。但你看着他们，就像看着婴儿一样，你知道，
[00:04:03.420] you're helping your parents take care of them as a baby as well. So I'm not really going to be like,
[00:04:03.420] 你也在帮父母照顾婴儿。所以我不会那样说，
[00:04:07.780] I was 14 and like take care of my sister. But you know, it's a different kind of responsibility,
[00:04:07.780] 我当时14岁，要照顾我妹妹。但你知道，这是另一种责任。
[00:04:12.500] I think than being the responsibility of being a just a normal four year older brother. You have
[00:04:12.500] 我认为，这比做一个普通的、比弟弟大四岁的哥哥的责任更重要。你拥有……
[00:04:19.020] no responsibility there, to be honest. Do you see that in your brother as well? Like in your brother's
[00:04:19.020] 说实话，我对此不承担任何责任。你觉得你哥哥身上也有这种特质吗？就像你哥哥的……
[00:04:25.100] relationship with your sister? Do you feel like he also is a little bit more gentle, maybe slightly more
[00:04:25.100] 你和姐姐的关系怎么样？你觉得他也更温柔一些，或许稍微更……
[00:04:29.980] parental to your sister versus to you? Yeah, definitely. I kind of feel like we have different
[00:04:29.980] 你觉得你对你妹妹和对你有什么区别？嗯，当然。我觉得我们之间有点不一样。
[00:04:35.860] relationships with each other just because it was kind of just like a timing thing. I think when they
[00:04:35.860] 他们之间的关系，只是因为时机不对。我觉得当他们
[00:04:41.000] were kind of like in elementary school, I left home for college. So I kind of wasn't hanging out
[00:04:41.000] 感觉就像回到了小学时代，我离开家去上大学了。所以，我基本上没怎么和朋友们一起玩。
[00:04:48.020] with them around that time. But kind of in the later years of their elementary into middle school,
[00:04:48.020] 大约在那个时候和他们在一起。但主要是在他们小学高年级到初中阶段，
[00:04:54.980] I was at home and then my brother was in college. From seeing them grow up, I kind of feel like maybe
[00:04:54.980] 我当时在家，然后我哥哥去上大学了。看着他们长大，我感觉也许
[00:05:00.200] those years when I was home, we're kind of more like formative for them. So I feel like just because
[00:05:00.200] 那些我待在家里的岁月，对他们来说更像是塑造人生的时期。所以我觉得，仅仅因为
[00:05:07.480] I was there and like living at home with them at the time, I feel like me and my sister relationship,
[00:05:07.480] 我当时就在那里，就像和她们住在一起一样，感觉就像我和姐妹一样。
[00:05:12.760] and then my brother and their relationship kind of like panned out a little differently,
[00:05:12.760] 然后，我哥哥和他们的关系发展得有点不一样了。
[00:05:16.460] just because of us being at home at different times of their, I guess, like growing up and,
[00:05:16.460] 我想，大概是因为我们待在家里的时间不同，比如在他们成长的过程中，
[00:05:21.300] you know, going through puberty as well. That makes total sense. I actually remember recently,
[00:05:21.300] 你知道，我也在经历青春期。这完全说得通。我最近还真记得，
[00:05:26.480] I think it was this year, you sent a picture of your sister in our group chat and we were all like,
[00:05:26.480] 我想应该是今年，你在我们的群聊里发了一张你姐姐的照片，我们当时都说：
[00:05:31.160] oh my god, they're so big now. Like they're a real person. No longer a baby. Yeah. Going through
[00:05:31.160] 我的天哪，他们现在长这么大了。就像真的一样。不再是婴儿了。是啊。正在经历
[00:05:38.120] high school, being interested in like trends, being on TikTok. Oh my god. Hearing them like use like
[00:05:38.120] 高中时，他们对潮流感兴趣，玩TikTok。我的天哪。听到他们用“like”这个词。
[00:05:43.980] skibbity, skibbity riz lingo on me. It's like, it's kind of crazy. Just it's crazy to see it like on
[00:05:43.980] skibbity，skibbity riz lingo 在我身上。这简直太疯狂了。看到它就像……
[00:05:52.320] TikTok, but then it's crazy to see it, I guess in your hometown life or in your home life.
[00:05:52.320] TikTok，但看到它发生在你的家乡生活或家庭生活中，感觉很疯狂。
[00:05:57.960] Oh my god, then are they like your source of Gen Z knowledge? I definitely see a lot of memes and
[00:05:57.960] 我的天哪，那它们就是你了解Z世代的来源吗？我确实看到了很多表情包和
[00:06:05.040] stuff like that that I wouldn't normally see, but I'm glad I see some of the memes. They're really
[00:06:05.040] 诸如此类我平时看不到的东西，但我很高兴能看到一些梗图。它们真的很棒。
[00:06:10.340] funny. Wait, actually, does your sister count as Gen Z or Gen Alpha? Do you know? Wait, Gen Alpha is
[00:06:10.340] 真搞笑。等等，你妹妹是Z世代还是阿尔法世代？你知道吗？等等，阿尔法世代是……
[00:06:16.920] younger, right? Yeah. I feel like they would be Gen Alpha. Do you think you feel a generation gap
[00:06:16.920] 更年轻，对吧？是的。我觉得他们应该是阿尔法世代。你觉得他们之间存在代沟吗？
[00:06:24.460] between you and your sister? Because that's actually two generations because we are
[00:06:24.460] 你和你姐姐之间？因为那实际上是两代人，因为我们是
[00:06:30.340] selenials. I guess like one and a half generations. I would say so for sure. I don't know. There are a
[00:06:30.340] 世代交替。我猜大概一代半吧。我肯定这么说。我不知道。有
[00:06:36.880] lot of similarities and there are a lot of differences. My sister is also kind of into like
[00:06:36.880] 有很多相似之处，也有很多不同之处。我妹妹也挺喜欢……
[00:06:41.780] kind of the gaming scene and also like art. So I think a lot of stuff that we're into,
[00:06:41.780] 我们喜欢游戏圈，也喜欢艺术。所以我觉得我们感兴趣的很多东西，
[00:06:47.040] there is some like overlap, but then there is a lot of differences as well. Like I know they play
[00:06:47.040] 它们之间有一些重叠之处，但也有很多不同之处。比如我知道他们玩
[00:06:52.320] like a lot of Roblox, which I think is so interesting to me because I've never played this game before in
[00:06:52.320] 就像很多 Roblox 游戏一样，我觉得这很有趣，因为我以前从来没玩过这款游戏。
[00:06:58.440] my life. I've always Roblox. It sounds and looks like kind of like a silly game. It sounds like Legos,
[00:06:58.440] 我的生活。我一直都在玩 Roblox。它听起来和看起来都像是一款有点傻乎乎的游戏。听起来像乐高积木，
[00:07:03.860] but nowadays I kind of see a lot of crazy content from Roblox where it doesn't even look like Roblox anymore.
[00:07:03.860] 但现在我看到很多 Roblox 的内容都变得很疯狂，看起来都不像 Roblox 了。
[00:07:09.240] Right. That's just like its own tangent. But yeah, it's just really interesting to see them play.
[00:07:09.240] 对，这完全是题外话。不过，看他们比赛确实很有意思。
[00:07:14.040] Like they're like, oh, I'm playing like the scary game on Roblox and now I'm playing with the shooting
[00:07:14.040] 就像他们会说，哦，我之前在玩 Roblox 上的恐怖游戏，现在我又开始玩射击游戏了。
[00:07:17.520] game. Oh my god. Oh, that's so interesting. Dude, we have a resident Roblox lover in this call.
[00:07:17.520] 游戏。我的天哪。哦，这太有意思了。兄弟，我们这群人里有位 Roblox 爱好者。
[00:07:24.280] Yeah, I'm a casual Roblox enjoyer. Oh wait. So I can connect with your sister actually.
[00:07:24.280] 是的，我偶尔玩玩 Roblox。哦等等。所以我其实可以和你妹妹联系上。
[00:07:30.520] That's how it's like kind of like similar, but like also like, at least for me, it's also different.
[00:07:30.520] 就是这样，有点相似，但至少对我来说，也有一些不同之处。
[00:07:35.500] Do you ever play Roblox with them? I think I tried once. It was like, okay, that's pretty interesting.
[00:07:35.500] 你跟他们一起玩过 Roblox 吗？我好像试过一次。感觉还挺有意思的。
[00:07:41.600] Destin, you need to play Dress to Impress with them. Yeah. It's a must. Oh, that's a Roblox game? Oh, I've been hearing.
[00:07:41.600] 德斯汀，你得跟他们玩“盛装打扮”游戏。对，一定要玩。哦，那是 Roblox 上的游戏？哦，我听说过。
[00:07:48.980] Or they made a Roblox version. Okay, that's sick. Wait, what are you playing on Roblox, Jisoo?
[00:07:48.980] 或者他们做了个 Roblox 版本。哇，太棒了。等等，Jisoo，你在 Roblox 上玩什么？
[00:07:53.360] Yeah, just Dress to Impress, but it's like so fun. I'm obsessed. Okay, okay. I also feel like on TikTok,
[00:07:53.360] 对，就是《盛装打扮》，但真的太好玩了。我简直着迷了。好吧好吧。我觉得在TikTok上，
[00:08:00.820] I'm scrolling, I see some sweaty kids playing Roblox, like FPS games. Oh wow. They're like
[00:08:00.820] 我正刷着网页，看到几个汗流浃背的小孩在玩 Roblox，就像第一人称射击游戏一样。哇哦。他们就像……
[00:08:05.860] doing like crazy flicks, like their mouths go crazy. I'm like, guys, this is just Roblox. But
[00:08:05.860] 他们做着各种疯狂的动作，嘴巴都张得老大。我就想说，伙计们，这只是 Roblox 而已。
[00:08:10.600] I also think a really interesting similarity is that they use Discord for everything, for like
[00:08:10.600] 我觉得一个非常有趣的相似之处是，他们什么都用 Discord，比如
[00:08:16.700] communication, which makes a lot of sense. Like Discord is a pretty great app, I think, for like
[00:08:16.700] 沟通，这很有道理。我觉得 Discord 就是一个很棒的应用程序，比如……
[00:08:21.420] a lot of different things, you know, servers and stuff. And it's really interesting because,
[00:08:21.420] 很多不同的东西，比如服务器之类的。这真的很有意思，因为：
[00:08:25.280] you know, I use Discord a lot too, but I know I have a lot of friends, maybe from my generation that
[00:08:25.280] 你知道，我也经常用Discord，但我知道我有很多朋友，也许是和我同龄的，
[00:08:30.800] use different apps to talk. You know, there's Instagram, people communicate along Instagram,
[00:08:30.800] 人们使用不同的应用程序进行交流。你知道，有Instagram，人们通过Instagram进行交流。
[00:08:35.500] and then, you know, there's Messenger as well. Right. I know even for like people that are like
[00:08:35.500] 然后，你知道，还有 Messenger。对。我知道即使对于那些喜欢……的人来说，
[00:08:40.780] five years younger than me, my Messenger notification will go off on my phone. They're
[00:08:40.780] 比我小五岁的人，我的手机上的 Messenger 通知就会响起。他们是
[00:08:45.040] like, there's no way you're on that app still. It's crazy. Wait, that's horrifying. Yeah.
[00:08:45.040] 你不可能还在用那个软件吧？太疯狂了。等等，这太可怕了。是啊。
[00:08:50.260] Does that mean we have to migrate out of Messenger? I don't know. No, literally people like my
[00:08:50.260] 那是不是意味着我们必须放弃 Messenger 了？我不知道。不，真的，像我这样的人
[00:08:54.760] coworkers, they're only 25. They're like, dude, there's no way you use it. It's crazy. Ouch.
[00:08:54.760] 同事们才25岁，他们会说：“哥们儿，你根本不可能用它。太疯狂了。” 真扎心。
[00:09:00.880] So yeah, even if it's like 25, it's out of fashion. For 14 year olds, they're like only on Discord.
[00:09:00.880] 所以，即使是25岁，也已经过时了。对于14岁的孩子来说，他们几乎只用Discord。
[00:09:06.840] They're like chopping it up in the Discord servers, you know, screen sharing them playing Roblox or
[00:09:06.840] 他们会在Discord服务器上聊天，你知道，还会分享屏幕一起玩Roblox之类的。
[00:09:12.160] like doing their math homework or something. Wait, screen sharing them doing math homework is crazy.
[00:09:12.160] 比如让他们做数学作业之类的。等等，让他们屏幕共享做数学作业也太疯狂了吧。
[00:09:18.320] I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Like new age cheating. I don't know if that's what kids would
[00:09:18.320] 我不知道。我是说，我真的不知道。就像现在流行的那种作弊方式。我不知道孩子们会不会那样做。
[00:09:22.200] do, but wait, that's actually a genius. Yeah, if I were a kid, I probably would be doing that.
[00:09:22.200] 确实可以，等等，这真是个天才的想法。是啊，如果我是个孩子，我可能也会这么做。
[00:09:27.320] We could crowdsource the homework together. Exactly. Everything's a good project.
[00:09:27.320] 我们可以一起众包完成作业。没错。任何项目都是好项目。
[00:09:33.220] Doing it on Discord instead of doing it in the breaks between classes. Yeah, that's so interesting.
[00:09:33.220] 与其在课间休息时讨论，不如在 Discord 上讨论。是啊，这真有意思。
[00:09:39.360] But when I think about it, I think it does make a lot of sense because Discord has communities.
[00:09:39.360] 但仔细想想，这确实很有道理，因为 Discord 有社区。
[00:09:43.540] So it's not just, you know, DMing or messaging. It's a forum almost as well. Like it's almost
[00:09:43.540] 所以它不仅仅是私信或留言。它几乎也像一个论坛。就像它几乎
[00:09:49.280] what Facebook was to us. I don't know how or like, I guess it's because it's like gaming adjacent that,
[00:09:49.280] Facebook 对我们来说意味着什么？我不知道具体是怎么回事，或者说喜欢它，我想可能是因为它和游戏有点关系吧。
[00:09:54.880] you know, younger kids kind of migrate to it. But I assume like once a group of people at school,
[00:09:54.880] 你知道，年纪小的孩子很容易就会接触到它。但我猜想，一旦学校里有一群人……
[00:10:00.380] I guess start using Discord, it's like, oh, you know, I want to talk to them. So everyone else
[00:10:00.380] 我想，开始用Discord吧，感觉就像，哦，你知道，我想和他们聊天。所以其他人
[00:10:03.940] is going to migrate to them. So it's just cool to see how the different messaging norms
[00:10:03.940] 将会迁移到这些平台。所以，看到不同的信息传递规范如何演变，真的很有意思。
[00:10:10.060] Yeah. For that generation. Dude, is this like a cycle? Because for us, we used AIM. And that's like a chat,
[00:10:10.060] 是啊，对那一代人来说。哥们，这算是一种循环吗？因为我们那一代用的是AIM，那就像个聊天软件。
[00:10:18.100] you know, dedicated chat app, if you can call it that. And Discord is technically that too.
[00:10:18.100] 你知道，就是那种专门的聊天应用，如果可以这么称呼的话。从技术上讲，Discord 也算是聊天应用。
[00:10:24.060] It's just a cycle. Like we're back to the chat apps. A little bit. I guess the Discord got big
[00:10:24.060] 这只是个循环。就像我们又回到了聊天软件时代。有点像。我猜Discord曾经很火。
[00:10:29.480] because of gaming. So I don't know what needs to get big for the next big thing. Maybe crypto or something.
[00:10:29.480] 因为游戏行业。所以我不知道下一个爆款会是什么。也许是加密货币之类的。
[00:10:34.220] Oh, VR. I think. Oh, maybe. Oh my god, the next generation is going to be on VR chat with like
[00:10:34.220] 哦，VR。我想。哦，也许吧。我的天，下一代人要用VR聊天了，比如……
[00:10:42.840] avatars. There's log gone after school. And that's like the norm. So when you communicate with your
[00:10:42.840] 头像。放学后就没了日志。这已经成了常态。所以当你和你的
[00:10:49.700] sister, I assume a decent amount of that is at home. But outside of the house, are you texting them,
[00:10:49.700] 姐姐，我猜你大部分时间都是在家度过的。但出门在外，你会给他们发短信吗？
[00:10:55.860] chatting them? Or are you on Discord? It's either I'm texting them or using Discord. I don't know if
[00:10:55.860] 你在跟他们聊天吗？还是在用Discord？我不是在发短信就是在用Discord。我不知道是不是
[00:11:01.960] that's like unusual. They also, a lot of times we'll just be like talking in memes. They'll just
[00:11:01.960] 这很不寻常。而且，很多时候我们说话就像是在用表情包。他们就……
[00:11:07.000] like send me a meme and then I'll just respond to a meme. No words even being said. I guess that's
[00:11:07.000] 比如，你给我发个表情包，我也会回复一个表情包。全程一句话都不用说。我想这就是了。
[00:11:12.620] how the kids talk to you today. That's kind of cute. They think you're cool enough to send memes too.
[00:11:12.620] 孩子们现在跟你说话的方式，还挺可爱的。他们觉得你很酷，还会给你发表情包。
[00:11:18.880] True. Yeah. I think that, you know, when you're like a kid in high school, you know,
[00:11:18.880] 没错。是啊。我觉得，你知道，当你还是个高中生的时候，你知道，
[00:11:23.520] you have like a lot of like complaints that you have after school. So sometimes the few times I pick
[00:11:23.520] 你放学后有很多抱怨。所以有时候，我挑剔的几次机会
[00:11:27.100] them up after school, I feel very grateful that, you know, they're very comfortable with being able
[00:11:27.100] 放学后把他们叫醒，我感到非常欣慰，你知道，他们很乐意这样做。
[00:11:31.780] to like tell me about their day, complaining about kids that made them mad or something throughout
[00:11:31.780] 比如跟我讲他们一天都做了些什么，抱怨哪些孩子惹他们生气之类的。
[00:11:36.860] the day. That's so cute, actually. Well, this is kind of stupid, but I didn't realize your sibling
[00:11:36.860] 那天。真是太可爱了。嗯，这有点傻，但我之前没注意到你的兄弟姐妹
[00:11:42.680] could just pick you up from school. Oh yeah, it's crazy, right? That is like another thing that
[00:11:42.680] 可以直接去学校接你。哦，是啊，太疯狂了，对吧？这就像另一件事……
[00:11:47.920] actually I've been thinking about is like when I was their age, starting in like middle school,
[00:11:47.920] 其实我一直在想，当我像他们那么大的时候，大概从初中开始，
[00:11:53.040] I had to take the bus home and then walk up my hill by myself every single day. You know,
[00:11:53.040] 我每天都得坐公交车回家，然后再独自爬上山坡。你知道吗？
[00:12:01.360] because like there's more people in the house that are available to pick them up.
[00:12:01.360] 因为家里人多，可以去接他们。
[00:12:05.780] But you know, there's a part of me that's like, oh, you know, back in my day, I had to,
[00:12:05.780] 但你知道，我内心深处会想，哦，你知道，想当年，我不得不……
[00:12:11.120] I had to find my own way home, you know, you have it good now. Oh my God. That's so true.
[00:12:11.120] 我得自己想办法回家，你知道，你现在日子过得真好。我的天哪。说得太对了。
[00:12:17.620] And, and you didn't even start driving until a little later as well. Yeah. So it's like definitely
[00:12:17.620] 而且，你也是过了一段时间才开始开车的。是啊。所以这肯定是的。
[00:12:24.100] part of me is like salty, but like, you know, part of me is like, you know, if I'm able to do it,
[00:12:24.100] 我一方面觉得有点不爽，但另一方面又觉得，如果我能做到的话，
[00:12:29.260] I might as well, you know, try and make their life easier. They've got a cushy life thanks to you.
[00:12:29.260] 我不如就尽力让他们过得轻松些吧。多亏了你，他们现在的生活才这么舒适。
[00:12:35.040] A little bit. I mean, you guys wouldn't know, but I definitely think being the oldest sibling
[00:12:35.040] 有一点点。我的意思是，你们可能不知道，但我确实觉得作为家里的老大，这方面我有点感觉。
[00:12:42.580] paves the way for younger siblings. Even with my brother, he was able to, you know, probably do things
[00:12:42.580] 这为弟弟妹妹们铺平了道路。即使是我弟弟，他也能，你知道，做一些事情。
[00:12:49.200] like get his license a little earlier than me, just because I mean, I can understand for parents,
[00:12:49.200] 比如他比我早一点拿到驾照，我的意思是，我能理解父母的想法。
[00:12:54.320] you know, the first kid making the leap for certain things is kind of like, it's big. But then once
[00:12:54.320] 你知道，第一个孩子在某些方面取得突破，意义重大。但之后一旦
[00:12:59.680] one kid has done it, I imagined it gets a lot easier. Yeah, I think I saw some Reddit comment
[00:12:59.680] 既然有个孩子做到了，我想应该会容易得多。嗯，我好像在Reddit上看到过相关的评论。
[00:13:05.000] from like a parent that was like, my first child is literally like, if I could, I would have bubble
[00:13:05.000] 就像一位家长说，我的第一个孩子简直就像，如果可以，我真想给他一个泡泡。
[00:13:12.180] wrapped them like to send out into the world. But then by like the second and third child, it was just
[00:13:12.180] 像要把它们送往世界各地一样精心包装。但到了第二个、第三个孩子的时候，就只是
[00:13:17.540] like, yeah, you know, they're probably okay, like whatever. That's actually a pretty interesting
[00:13:17.540] 嗯，你知道，他们可能没事，随便吧。这其实挺有意思的。
[00:13:22.060] point. Because, you know, for my mom, I am my mom's first child. But actually, for my sister,
[00:13:22.060] 重点。因为，你知道，对我妈妈来说，我是她的第一个孩子。但实际上，对我姐姐来说，
[00:13:28.560] my sister is my stepdad's first child. I can actually kind of see the differences because my
[00:13:28.560] 我妹妹是我继父的第一个孩子。我其实能看出一些区别，因为我
[00:13:34.220] mom is pretty like, hands off a little bit with my sister. Because you know, it is my mom's third child,
[00:13:34.220] 我妈妈对妹妹有点放任不管。因为你知道，这是我妈妈的第三个孩子。
[00:13:41.020] not to say that she doesn't care about them. But you know, she's just definitely a little more laid back.
[00:13:41.020] 并不是说她不在乎他们。但你知道，她确实比较随和。
[00:13:45.640] And I can definitely see my stepdad being just more attentive and being on them.
[00:13:45.640] 我完全可以想象我的继父会更加细心，更加关注他们。
[00:13:52.020] Oh, that is interesting. Your sister is the oldest sibling and the youngest sibling at the same time.
[00:13:52.020] 哦，真有意思。你姐姐既是家里的老大，又是最小的妹妹。
[00:13:58.860] A little bit. Yeah, it's, it's pretty interesting. I know that they've tried to ask my stepdad if like,
[00:13:58.860] 有点儿。嗯，挺有意思的。我知道他们问过我继父，比如，
[00:14:05.140] they can take the bus too, you know, when they're when no one's able to take them home. But I feel like
[00:14:05.140] 你知道，当没人能送他们回家的时候，他们也可以坐公交车。但我感觉
[00:14:09.360] my stepdad's a little bit like, you know, first child is like, also, also they're a girl as well.
[00:14:09.360] 我的继父有点像，你知道，第一个孩子就像，而且，而且她还是个女孩。
[00:14:15.060] So, so I feel like my stepdad's like, Oh, you know, might as well just get driven, you know,
[00:14:15.060] 所以，我觉得我继父就像是，哦，你知道，还不如直接开车送我去呢，你知道吗？
[00:14:20.420] you don't need to take the bus.
[00:14:20.420] 你不需要坐公交车。
[00:14:22.120] Right.
[00:14:22.120] 正确的。
[00:14:25.360] So I guess as the oldest sibling in your family, do you feel like you do a lot of reflecting like
[00:14:25.360] 所以我想，作为家里的老大，你是不是经常会反思一些事情？
[00:14:31.400] that where you're like, comparing maybe your experiences growing up to your sisters or even
[00:14:31.400] 就是那种你会拿自己和姐妹们的成长经历做比较的情况，或者甚至是……
[00:14:36.220] your brothers? Definitely. I think just, it's like what I was saying earlier, like when I see
[00:14:36.220] 你的兄弟们？当然。我觉得就像我之前说的，就像当我看到
[00:14:40.520] them kind of have an easier time with certain things than I had it. I definitely probably was
[00:14:40.520] 他们在某些方面比我更容易一些。我肯定也是。
[00:14:46.400] like salty about some stuff, but ultimately, you know, that's whatever. If I can make their life
[00:14:46.400] 可能对某些事有点不满，但最终，你知道，那都无所谓了。如果我能让他们的生活更美好，那就太好了。
[00:14:52.200] easier, I'm fine with it. Then when the difference is like so large between you and your sister,
[00:14:52.200] 这样比较容易，我没意见。但是当你和你妹妹之间的差距真的很大的时候，
[00:14:59.880] if there's stuff that maybe makes you a little salty, is it just easier to brush off or maybe not
[00:14:59.880] 如果有些事让你有点不高兴，你是选择一笑置之，还是就没那么容易了呢？
[00:15:06.920] even be salty about now? Cause it's just so far in the past. Oh, well, I definitely think with my
[00:15:06.920] 现在还会耿耿于怀吗？毕竟都过去那么久了。哦，好吧，我肯定觉得……
[00:15:11.960] sister, there's a little bit of a difference because I feel like with my brother, you know,
[00:15:11.960] 姐姐，这有点不一样，因为我觉得和哥哥在一起，你知道，
[00:15:16.100] I kind of still think we're kind of like in the same generation or we're kind of like on an equal
[00:15:16.100] 我仍然觉得我们算是同一代人，或者说我们地位差不多。
[00:15:21.140] level a little bit, but like with my sister, it's like a little bit more of like a
[00:15:21.140] 稍微平和了一些，但就像我妹妹一样，更像是……
[00:15:26.060] adult to child kind of like relationship. So there's a lot more like leeway or like, you know,
[00:15:26.060] 就像成人与孩子之间的关系一样。所以，这种关系有更多的回旋余地，或者说，你知道的，
[00:15:32.240] I give a lot more like grace. Yeah. Then do you have a lot of feelings of like protectiveness
[00:15:32.240] 我给予的更多是宽容。是的。那么你是不是有很多保护欲之类的感觉？
[00:15:39.160] around your sister? Cause I feel like that's kind of the natural next step, right? It's like you see
[00:15:39.160] 和你姐姐在一起吗？因为我觉得这算是顺理成章的下一步，对吧？就像你看到
[00:15:43.460] the big age gap, you know, you're kind of in different generations and then you go into like
[00:15:43.460] 年龄差距很大，你知道，你们属于不同的世代，然后你们就进入了……
[00:15:48.040] protective bear mode. Um, when I think about it, I think the personality of my sister, I feel like
[00:15:48.040] 保护熊模式。嗯，仔细想想，我觉得我妹妹的性格是这样的：
[00:15:54.880] they can kind of fend for themselves. They can solve their own problems. So I kind of feel like
[00:15:54.880] 他们基本上可以自力更生，能够解决自己的问题。所以我感觉……
[00:16:00.380] I trust them to be able to make their own good decisions. And I also feel like if they were on
[00:16:00.380] 我相信他们能够做出正确的决定。而且我也觉得，如果他们……
[00:16:06.760] the fence about making a decision, they would feel comfortable enough to ask me about it. But I do think
[00:16:06.760] 如果他们还在犹豫不决，他们会觉得可以放心地问我。但我确实认为
[00:16:13.580] if their personality were maybe a little different, you know, I don't know what the personality would
[00:16:13.580] 如果他们的性格稍微不同一些，你知道，我不知道他们的性格会是什么样子。
[00:16:18.100] be, but you know, something that might feel like they can't maybe fend for themselves, maybe in
[00:16:18.100] 是，但你知道，他们可能会觉得无法照顾自己，也许在
[00:16:23.440] like a school environment with like their peers or anything. Not that high school is dangerous.
[00:16:23.440] 就像在学校里和同龄人相处一样。并不是说高中很危险。
[00:16:28.020] Maybe it is dangerous. No, I don't know. But yeah, maybe if they did have a personality like that,
[00:16:28.020] 也许很危险。不，我不知道。但是，如果他们真的有那样的性格，也许……
[00:16:32.440] I could see myself maybe trying to be a little more protective.
[00:16:32.440] 我感觉自己可能会变得更有保护欲。
[00:16:36.640] I feel like it just reminds me of, okay, now that I think about it, I don't know if this ever
[00:16:36.640] 我觉得它让我想起，好吧，现在想想，我不知道这是否曾经发生过
[00:16:40.780] happened in real life, but telling on TV shows where kids are like, oh, well, my brother is older than
[00:16:40.780] 现实生活中确实发生过这样的事，但在电视节目里讲，孩子们会说，哦，我哥哥比我大。
[00:16:46.560] your brother. My brother is way cooler. And then they go back and forth on whose brother is like the
[00:16:46.560] 你哥哥。我哥哥比你酷多了。然后他们就开始争论谁的哥哥更像……
[00:16:51.240] oldest. Your sister would win all of those battles because that 14 year age gap is pretty rare. I
[00:16:51.240] 你是姐姐。你姐姐肯定会赢，因为14岁的年龄差距非常罕见。
[00:16:57.060] think that is a good point. I definitely think like, I remember when they were like a kid, you know,
[00:16:57.060] 我觉得你说得很有道理。我确实记得他们还是孩子的时候，你知道，
[00:17:02.240] when you're, when you're a kid and in like probably like preschool, kindergarten, they always ask you
[00:17:02.240] 当你还是个孩子，比如在幼儿园、学前班的时候，他们总是会问你
[00:17:07.140] like, oh, who are your role models? And I think, you know, they would, they would like write about me
[00:17:07.140] 比如，哦，你的榜样是谁？我觉得，你知道，他们会，他们会想写写我。
[00:17:12.040] and like my parents a lot too. Yeah. So I definitely think they appreciate that. And they
[00:17:12.040] 而且我也很喜欢我的父母。是的。所以我肯定他们会很感激的。而且他们
[00:17:20.080] think it's like cool having such older siblings. And also they are interested in art. I'd like to
[00:17:20.080] 我觉得有这样的哥哥姐姐很酷。而且他们对艺术也很感兴趣。我想
[00:17:26.420] believe that I can be like a good role model or like, you know, show them maybe what is possible
[00:17:26.420] 我相信我可以成为一个好榜样，或者说，向他们展示一些可能性。
[00:17:32.260] about what you can do through art. It makes me feel proud that, you know, they can be like,
[00:17:32.260] 了解艺术能带给你什么。这让我感到自豪，你知道，他们可以像这样，
[00:17:37.880] oh, my brother is like so, so old and cool. No, not the old part. I mean, also, I bet it's hella cool
[00:17:37.880] 哦，我哥哥真是又老又酷。不，不是指他老。我是说，我敢肯定他超级酷。
[00:17:45.500] for your sister to be able to say something like, dude, my brother is like a tattoo artist. There's not
[00:17:45.500] 你妹妹居然能说出这样的话：“哥们儿，我哥简直就是个纹身师。” 这简直不可思议。
[00:17:51.260] a lot of people who could probably say that in high school. Yeah. I don't, I don't know if they do,
[00:17:51.260] 很多人高中时可能都能这么说。是啊。我不知道他们是不是这么说。
[00:17:55.400] but I can imagine them bragging about it. It's whatever though. They always are like, oh, when I'm 18,
[00:17:55.400] 但我能想象他们会为此炫耀。不过也无所谓了。他们总是会说，哦，等我18岁的时候……
[00:18:03.040] I'm gonna let you tattoo me. I'm like, okay, you're gonna get me in trouble. But okay.
[00:18:03.040] 我打算让你给我纹身。我心想，好吧，你肯定会给我惹麻烦的。但好吧。
[00:18:11.080] So I guess growing up, my high school friend group was all girls. And a lot of us had older brothers,
[00:18:11.080] 所以，我猜想，在我成长的过程中，我的高中朋友圈全是女生。而且我们很多人都有哥哥。
[00:18:18.660] not quite the 14 year age gap, but maybe like six to eight years or so. I remember one of those days
[00:18:18.660] 虽然没有十四岁的年龄差距，但大概也有六到八岁左右吧。我记得有那么一天。
[00:18:25.000] in high school, I met my friend's older brother, and he had a kid. And I just was so shocked to like
[00:18:25.000] 高中时，我认识了我朋友的哥哥，他有个孩子。我当时真的非常震惊，竟然喜欢上了他。
[00:18:31.220] meet a real adult, you know, who looked just like my friend. And it was just like such an iconic
[00:18:31.220] 遇到一个真正的成年人，你知道，他长得就像我的朋友一样。这简直太经典了。
[00:18:36.580] moment that I still remember it like very vividly. Like we were in my friend's garage,
[00:18:36.580] 那一刻我至今记忆犹新。当时我们在我朋友的车库里，
[00:18:39.960] and I like shook his hand. But you know, your sister, now that they're a sophomore in high school,
[00:18:39.960] 我跟他握了手。但是你知道，你妹妹现在都上高二了，
[00:18:45.280] they're kind of getting to that age. So like, have you ever met your sister's friends? Do you think
[00:18:45.280] 她们差不多都到了那个年纪了。所以，你见过你姐姐的朋友吗？你觉得
[00:18:49.900] you've ever had a moment like that, but the reverse? I feel like my sister's friends are like shy. So
[00:18:49.900] 你有没有过类似的经历，但反过来呢？我觉得我姐姐的朋友们都比较害羞。
[00:18:55.200] I feel like when I sometimes I like will pick them up, and then I'll drive their friends as well.
[00:18:55.200] 我觉得有时候我会去接他们，然后顺便也带上他们的朋友。
[00:19:01.060] I don't know if it's just like being a kid around like older adults, you're just like,
[00:19:01.060] 我不知道这是否就像孩子和大人在一起一样，你会觉得……
[00:19:05.280] don't really like talk that much. Or you just like talks amongst yourselves. It's I feel like
[00:19:05.280] 不太喜欢说话。或者你们只是喜欢和自己人聊天。我觉得……
[00:19:09.140] that's like a teenager thing. You know, they're like in their own bubble. When you're like an adult,
[00:19:09.140] 那就像青少年才会有的事。你知道，他们就像活在自己的世界里。当你长大成人后，
[00:19:13.740] you're like, Oh, you're too old for this bubble. So you're not gonna you're not gonna get the skibity,
[00:19:13.740] 你会想，哦，你年纪太大了，不适合这个泡沫了。所以你不会，你不会得到那种感觉。
[00:19:18.100] you know, we got too much for you over here. Dustin, you're literally like the parent picking.
[00:19:18.100] 你知道吗，我们这儿的东西太多了，你根本吃不完。达斯汀，你简直就像个挑菜的家长。
[00:19:24.620] Yeah, cool. Driving their friends around. Do you ever drive them to like the mall?
[00:19:24.620] 是啊，挺酷的。开车带他们和朋友们到处逛逛。你会开车带他们去商场之类的地方吗？
[00:19:30.220] Do kids still do that? Hang out at the mall? I have gone to the mall with my sister maybe like
[00:19:30.220] 现在的孩子还这样吗？在商场里闲逛？我以前可能和姐姐一起去过商场。
[00:19:35.460] once or twice in the last year just to like hang out, you know? So I still think the mall is a cool
[00:19:35.460] 去年我去过一两次，就是去逛逛，你知道吗？所以我仍然觉得商场很酷。
[00:19:40.540] thing. I also think my girlfriend, Amber is an only child. Amber and my sister will like hang out,
[00:19:40.540] 我觉得我女朋友Amber是独生女。Amber和我妹妹会一起出去玩，
[00:19:49.020] we'll all hang out pretty often. Amber will like note certain things that I'll do. She'll be like,
[00:19:49.020] 我们会经常一起出去玩。Amber会记下我做的一些事情。她会说，
[00:19:55.820] oh, that's so like caring or like so patient of you. And I'm like, dang, must be nice being an only
[00:19:55.820] 哦，你真是太体贴、太有耐心了。我就想，哎，做个独生子女真好啊。
[00:20:02.660] child, you know? No, I'm just kidding. But I don't know. I don't know. Man, the mess up thing is that
[00:20:02.660] 孩子，你知道吗？不，我开玩笑的。但我不知道。我真的不知道。唉，搞砸的事情就是……
[00:20:10.400] both Jisoo and James are only children. So yeah, that is... Yeah, stay with your chest.
[00:20:10.400] Jisoo和James都是独生子女。所以，嗯……嗯，管好你自己了。
[00:20:17.700] That's so funny. Trying to talk shit. You guys have no one, you guys have no one to keep you guys in
[00:20:17.700] 真可笑。想说三道四？你们这些人真是孤立无援，没人能保护你们。
[00:20:23.880] check or to show you what it's like on the other side of the lawn. I was kind of thinking like your
[00:20:23.880] 检查一下，或者给你看看草坪另一边是什么样子。我当时的想法跟你差不多。
[00:20:31.620] sister being low-key the oldest and the youngest sibling at the same time. I wonder if that's what
[00:20:31.620] 姐姐表面上是家里的老大，实际上却是最小的。我想知道是不是这样。
[00:20:38.720] being an only child is like, like you're super protected by your parents, but at the same time,
[00:20:38.720] 作为独生子女就像是，你会受到父母的超级保护，但同时，
[00:20:44.060] you're well taken care of because it's like, oh, this is my only child. Yeah, I guess so. I feel
[00:20:44.060] 你被照顾得很好，因为就好像，哦，这是我唯一的孩子。嗯，我想是的。我感觉
[00:20:50.380] like I have felt like that. It's like baby of the family, but I have to fend for myself when I go
[00:20:50.380] 我也有过这种感觉。就像家里的老幺，但离开家后却要自己照顾自己。
[00:20:55.720] outside and my friends aren't there. So I don't like this laughing.
[00:20:55.720] 我在外面，朋友们都不在。所以我不喜欢这种笑声。
[00:21:02.960] No, this is funny.
[00:21:02.960] 不，这很有趣。
[00:21:05.400] Oh, I think it's so funny that Amber points out, wow, Destin, like that's so patient of you or like
[00:21:05.400] 哦，我觉得Amber说“哇，Destin，你真有耐心”或者“这太搞笑了”之类的话
[00:21:11.100] so caring of you. I think it's also extra funny because Destin's attitude usually, you know, just
[00:21:11.100] 真关心你。我觉得这特别搞笑，因为德斯汀的态度通常，你知道，就是……
[00:21:17.520] outwardly with us close friends and stuff, it's very nonchalant, super chill. And so it's like,
[00:21:17.520] 表面上，和我们这些亲密的朋友在一起时，我表现得非常随意，超级放松。所以感觉就像是，
[00:21:23.080] I'm sure seeing you with your younger siblings, being an older sibling to them is like a whole
[00:21:23.080] 我相信，看到你和弟弟妹妹们在一起，作为他们的哥哥姐姐，一定感觉很幸福。
[00:21:28.740] new perspective. Yeah. I definitely feel like there's like a shift. I think when, you know,
[00:21:28.740] 新的视角。是的。我确实感觉发生了某种转变。我觉得当，你知道，
[00:21:34.100] I have to be around my younger sister and then like when I'm with people normally in my age,
[00:21:34.100] 我必须和妹妹待在一起，然后就像我和同龄人在一起时一样，
[00:21:40.080] for example, at my work, we have some events at the tattoo shop. I can imagine when you're like a kid
[00:21:40.080] 例如，在我工作的地方，我们会在纹身店举办一些活动。我可以想象你像个孩子一样……
[00:21:46.300] in high school, like being able to go to like events like this is like super fun. So I have them
[00:21:46.300] 在高中，能够参加这样的活动真的超级好玩。所以我参加过。
[00:21:52.180] accompany me a lot when I'm like tabling at these events. Not to say that I have to censor myself,
[00:21:52.180] 当我在这些活动上摆摊的时候，他们经常陪着我。但这并不意味着我需要自我约束。
[00:21:57.780] but I just like, it's an interesting clash of worlds. It's kind of like my co workers. But then
[00:21:57.780] 但我只是觉得，这是一种有趣的跨界碰撞。有点像我的同事们。但是后来
[00:22:03.740] I'm also like here as like my sister's older brother and also kind of a little bit like their chaperone.
[00:22:03.740] 我在这里既像是我姐姐的哥哥，也有点像他们的监护人。
[00:22:10.220] Right? Well, so do you try not I mean, I'm trying to understand what you mean by censor like censor
[00:22:10.220] 对吧？嗯，所以你尽量不……我的意思是，我试图理解你说的“像审查员一样审查”是什么意思。
[00:22:14.860] the types of jokes you make? Or do you try not to cuss? Or like, what is it that you're censoring?
[00:22:14.860] 你讲的笑话类型是什么？或者你尽量不说脏话？或者说，你在审查什么内容？
[00:22:19.260] I think a little bit like that. I'm still kind of like working. So I'm still trying to be
[00:22:19.260] 我的想法有点像那样。我还在努力工作。所以我还在尝试……
[00:22:24.180] professional. But I think I have to a little bit like keep an eye on them, make sure they're like
[00:22:24.180] 他们是专业的。但我认为我得稍微关注一下他们，确保他们像……
[00:22:29.180] entertained and make sure they're like still alive, still at the venue.
[00:22:29.180] 让他们开心，并确保他们还活着，还留在现场。
[00:22:33.440] Still alive.
[00:22:33.440] 还活着。
[00:22:35.280] I guess kind of like just keep an eye on them. But then also kind of like,
[00:22:35.280] 我觉得应该稍微留意一下他们。但同时，也应该像这样：
[00:22:38.920] you know, still be doing the stuff that I need to do.
[00:22:38.920] 你知道，我还是会继续做我该做的事情。
[00:22:41.600] Oh my god, it's literally bring your child to work day.
[00:22:41.600] 我的天哪，今天是带孩子上班日！
[00:22:44.060] Wait, yeah.
[00:22:44.060] 等等，是的。
[00:22:46.600] I appreciate though that I share like this kind of like, you know,
[00:22:46.600] 不过我很感激大家能这样分享，你知道的。
[00:22:50.760] unconventional and like the fun parts of this interesting industry with them. My co workers
[00:22:50.760] 我的同事们性格不拘一格，喜欢和他们一起体验这个有趣行业中的乐趣。
[00:22:56.340] are all like younger people. And they're like all like artists and like do interesting things.
[00:22:56.340] 他们都像年轻人。他们好像都是艺术家，做着很有趣的事情。
[00:23:00.760] So I think it's like pretty cool that I can just like introduce them to all these kinds of different
[00:23:00.760] 所以我觉得挺酷的，我可以向他们介绍所有这些不同的东西。
[00:23:04.680] people as well that have these like jobs that you probably wouldn't even imagine can be a job
[00:23:04.680] 有些人从事的工作，你可能根本想象不到也能算作工作。
[00:23:11.000] in high school. That's super cool. Your sister has a good living the life a good life, man.
[00:23:11.000] 还在上高中？太酷了！你妹妹过着很棒的生活，兄弟。
[00:23:18.680] Do you ever find yourself saying stuff to your sister that could potentially lean luxury?
[00:23:18.680] 你有没有跟妹妹说过一些可能带有奢侈意味的话？
[00:23:24.660] Oh my god. Like, oh, remember to do this before you go to school. Like don't forget to do this.
[00:23:24.660] 我的天哪。比如，哦，记得上学前做这件事。千万别忘了做这件事。
[00:23:29.620] Make sure you're taking care of your health like that kind of stuff that I feel like parents often
[00:23:29.620] 确保你好好照顾自己的健康，就像我觉得父母经常会做的那样。
[00:23:33.360] talk about. I think I try not to be a luxury with them. But I do think there is this kind of like
[00:23:33.360] 谈谈吧。我觉得我尽量不让他们觉得我奢侈。但我确实觉得有这种感觉……
[00:23:40.680] line where it's like, we're like joking and then it's like, oh, I'm trying to be like serious with
[00:23:40.680] 就是那种感觉，我们一开始在开玩笑，然后突然就变成，哦，我其实想认真点儿。
[00:23:46.220] you and you have to like listen to me. I think like one specific thing was when we were like on vacation
[00:23:46.220] 你得听我说。我觉得有一件事特别有意思，就是我们度假的时候。
[00:23:52.220] one time together and it was just me and them hanging out. I just think like for whatever reason,
[00:23:52.220] 我们只一起待过一次，就我们三个。我觉得不管是什么原因，
[00:23:58.020] I was getting annoyed at them. I don't know what they were doing, but waffling around like just being
[00:23:58.020] 我开始对他们感到恼火。我不知道他们在干什么，但他们就像无所事事一样，磨磨蹭蹭的。
[00:24:03.040] a teenager. You know, normally when I talk to them, usually it's pretty chill and we're like always
[00:24:03.040] 一个十几岁的孩子。你知道，通常我和他们聊天的时候，气氛都很轻松，我们就像往常一样。
[00:24:08.640] joking and everything. But I think I said something like, okay, I'm getting kind of annoyed now. Can
[00:24:08.640] 开玩笑什么的。但我觉得我当时说了类似这样的话：好吧，我现在有点生气了。可以吗？
[00:24:14.900] you stop? Can you stop talking, talking like that? And I just need to like chill for a bit.
[00:24:14.900] 你停下来好吗？你能别再说话了吗？别再那样说话了。我只想冷静一下。
[00:24:20.220] And they're like, oh, so there is that kind of, I don't know how to say it, but it's like this line
[00:24:20.220] 然后他们会说，哦，所以有那种，我不知道该怎么说，但就像这样。
[00:24:25.840] of being serious. And then like, you have to take me seriously now and listen to me. And it's just like
[00:24:25.840] 认真点。然后就好像，你现在必须认真对待我，听我的话。就像这样。
[00:24:32.100] sometimes when I think they're being kind of a teenager. And I think when you're a teenager,
[00:24:32.100] 有时候我觉得他们有点像青少年。我觉得当你还是个青少年的时候，
[00:24:37.140] you think you're like on top of the world, you're like invincible. Everything in your head is the right
[00:24:37.140] 你觉得自己站在世界之巅，所向披靡。你脑子里的一切都是对的。
[00:24:43.320] answer. And you know, sometimes, sometimes I think when that comes out of them, I can get a little
[00:24:43.320] 回答。你知道，有时候，有时候我觉得当他们说出那样的话时，我会有点……
[00:24:49.800] irritated. But most of the time I try not to express it. But sometimes, sometimes I feel like
[00:24:49.800] 感到恼火。但大多数时候我尽量不表现出来。但有时，有时我会觉得……
[00:24:55.540] I have to say something. So that's like put them in their place a little bit. And that's like that line.
[00:24:55.540] 我必须说点什么。这就像是给他们一点颜色看看。这就是我说的重点。
[00:25:02.160] I'm trying to be serious. And I'm not trying to make a joke or anything. I'm just trying to say
[00:25:02.160] 我尽量认真一点，不是想开玩笑什么的，我只是想说……
[00:25:06.960] something, you know, hopefully I think is helpful for them. That's so interesting because I feel like
[00:25:06.960] 你知道，我希望这能对他们有所帮助。这很有意思，因为我觉得
[00:25:14.180] based on my long standing sibling studies, siblings are usually so like, okay with,
[00:25:14.180] 根据我长期以来对兄弟姐妹的研究，兄弟姐妹通常都挺能接受的，
[00:25:23.320] I don't want to say okay with fighting, but it kind of is like being okay with conflict or like
[00:25:23.320] 我不想说我接受争吵，但这有点像接受冲突，或者说……
[00:25:28.280] calling each other out, right? Like, I feel like maybe that's the relationship that you might have
[00:25:28.280] 互相指责，对吧？我觉得，这或许就是你们之间的关系。
[00:25:32.000] with your brother, where if he's being annoying, maybe you would be a little bit more blunt and be like,
[00:25:32.000] 如果你的弟弟很烦人，你或许会更直白一些，比如：
[00:25:36.280] okay, shut up or something. But it sounds like you wouldn't ever say that to your sister.
[00:25:36.280] 好吧，闭嘴吧。但听起来你永远不会对你妹妹说这种话。
[00:25:41.220] I think we would feel comfortable with saying stuff how it is. I just think we normally don't
[00:25:41.220] 我觉得我们应该能坦然地把事情说出来。只是我们通常不会这么做。
[00:25:49.000] have conflict. I do think they're in that stage where they want to just kind of do their own thing,
[00:25:49.000] 他们之间会有冲突。我认为他们现在正处于想要各自做自己事情的阶段。
[00:25:55.400] you know, talk to their friends online, hang out in their room and, you know, high school life.
[00:25:55.400] 你知道，他们会在网上和朋友聊天，在房间里闲逛，你知道，这就是他们的高中生活。
[00:26:00.320] So I'm not like super involved in their day to day life. I think if I was maybe there would be
[00:26:00.320] 所以我并没有特别深入地参与他们的日常生活。我想如果我参与得更多一些，也许会……
[00:26:06.160] more conflict. Yeah, I guess it's like the idea that you handle conflict with your sister more
[00:26:06.160] 冲突更多。是啊，我猜这就像你处理和你妹妹之间的冲突的方式一样。
[00:26:13.100] maturely, I guess, or with more patience versus your brother who is more similar to us in terms of age
[00:26:13.100] 我想，你比较成熟，或者说更有耐心，比你哥哥更有耐心，你哥哥的年龄和我们更接近。
[00:26:22.680] and generation. So it feels like you can just be almost more immature with them, right?
[00:26:22.680] 以及这一代人。所以感觉和他们在一起的时候，你可以稍微幼稚一些，对吧？
[00:26:28.220] Yeah, not as gentle. Yeah, with advice. I definitely think when I'm like trying to bring
[00:26:28.220] 是的，没那么温柔。是的，会给些建议。我肯定觉得当我试图……的时候
[00:26:35.900] up something to my sister, I'm like thinking of how to like carefully word it because I feel like I
[00:26:35.900] 我想跟姐姐说点什么，我在想该怎么措辞才好，因为我觉得我
[00:26:42.900] want to word it in a way where, you know, this is an issue and I want you to like listen and like take
[00:26:42.900] 我想换个方式表达，你知道，这是一个问题，我希望你能听听并重视它。
[00:26:48.020] it seriously. But I'm not like angry. I'm not like fuming. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm
[00:26:48.020] 我是认真的。但我不是生气，也不是怒不可遏，更不是想让你难过。
[00:26:58.200] I feel like it's a very unique position to be in almost because when you're the active parent
[00:26:58.200] 我觉得这是一种非常独特的处境，因为当你扮演的是积极主动的父母角色时，情况就比较特殊了。
[00:27:04.740] dealing with your kid, I think there is a little bit more immediate emotional investment. Not to
[00:27:04.740] 我觉得，在照顾孩子的时候，你会投入更多的情感。并非如此。
[00:27:10.760] say that you're not invested in your sister's life, but it's more so like, okay, this is my direct child.
[00:27:10.760] 表面上说你对妹妹的生活漠不关心，但实际上更像是，好吧，这是我的亲生孩子。
[00:27:15.780] The entire weight of this person's life lies on my shoulders. But with you, it's almost like you can
[00:27:15.780] 这个人的整个人生都压在我的肩上。但和你在一起，就好像你能做到一样。
[00:27:22.420] take a step back when you need to, but also be involved when you need to. So I feel like it's
[00:27:22.420] 需要的时候就退后一步，需要的时候也要参与其中。所以我感觉是这样。
[00:27:27.040] a cool position to be in and kind of a rare relationship too. It's like you can kind of
[00:27:27.040] 这是一种很棒的处境，也是一种比较少见的关系。感觉就像你可以……
[00:27:31.860] control the closeness and like the delicateness, I guess, of the relationship. That's actually a
[00:27:31.860] 控制亲密程度，以及这种微妙的关系，我想。这实际上是一种
[00:27:37.320] really interesting way to put it. I think it is really cool because I can have all the good parts,
[00:27:37.320] 这种说法真有趣。我觉得这很棒，因为我可以同时拥有所有好的方面。
[00:27:43.760] I guess, of like having a new like member of the family, you know, you know, they're like super cute.
[00:27:43.760] 我想，就像家里多了个新成员一样，你知道，你知道，他们超级可爱。
[00:27:50.420] I can play with them. I can, you know, hang out with them when they're not crying. But then when,
[00:27:50.420] 我可以和他们一起玩。你知道，当他们不哭的时候，我可以和他们待在一起。但是当……
[00:27:54.960] you know, when they are crying, when they, when they're like going, you know, when they're getting
[00:27:54.960] 你知道，当他们哭泣的时候，当他们，当他们像那样，你知道，当他们开始
[00:27:59.400] picked up from school, going to school, getting their lunch packed, you know, I'm not like super
[00:27:59.400] 接他们放学，送他们去学校，帮他们打包午餐，你知道，我不是那种超级超级……
[00:28:04.720] involved with them, you know, I can kind of like let my parents deal with it. So it definitely is
[00:28:04.720] 和他们打交道的话，你知道，我可以让我父母去处理。所以这绝对是……
[00:28:09.360] kind of like a, kind of like a nice opportunity to have them very grateful for. Something that I
[00:28:09.360] 这就像是一个，就像是一个很好的机会，让他们对此充满感激。这是我……
[00:28:15.620] think is interesting that I just remembered when my sister was a little younger, they would argue a lot
[00:28:15.620] 我觉得很有意思，我突然想起我妹妹小时候，她们经常吵架。
[00:28:21.180] with my stepdad. So when things got a little too heated, it was interesting that they would run to
[00:28:21.180] 和我的继父在一起。所以当气氛变得有点紧张的时候，他们会跑去……这很有意思。
[00:28:27.740] me kind of like talk to me. So I think in that sense, I would I did kind of become like the third
[00:28:27.740] 感觉就像在跟我说话。所以我觉得从这个意义上讲，我确实有点像第三个人了。
[00:28:33.780] parent. Oh, so that was pretty interesting. And then you know, even my stepdad would be like, Oh,
[00:28:33.780] 家长。哦，那挺有意思的。然后你知道，就连我的继父也会说，哦，
[00:28:39.820] I kind of got an argument with them. So if you can help them talk to them and like help them feel
[00:28:39.820] 我跟他们吵了一架。所以如果你能帮帮他们，跟他们谈谈，帮助他们放松一下，那就太好了。
[00:28:46.260] better, that'd be great. Wow, that's so cute. Yeah. It's kind of like at work when you have a real boss
[00:28:46.260] 那就好，太好了。哇，真可爱。是啊。有点像在公司里遇到真正的老板一样。
[00:28:52.640] and then you have like a mentor. A little bit. I do feel like maybe my position is a little bit of like
[00:28:52.640] 然后你就会有一位导师。有点像。我的确觉得我的位置可能有点像……
[00:29:00.020] a mentor, mentor slash friend. Wow. So would you say that your sister leans on you more than they
[00:29:00.020] 导师，亦师亦友。哇。所以你会说你妹妹更依赖你而不是他们
[00:29:06.960] lean on your brother? Definitely. No, I definitely think that they would probably say that as well.
[00:29:06.960] 依靠你兄弟？当然。不，我绝对认为他们也会这么说。
[00:29:13.120] I kind of attribute that to what I was saying earlier, like, in their like kind of like more
[00:29:13.120] 我觉得这跟我之前说的有点关系，就像，在他们身上，有点像，更多
[00:29:17.980] formative, maybe like rebellious years. That's when I was like at home and my brother was in college.
[00:29:17.980] 那段时期很关键，或许也算是叛逆期吧。那时候我待在家里，哥哥在上大学。
[00:29:22.860] I also feel like in general, my brother just kind of like sticks his own thing.
[00:29:22.860] 我也觉得，总的来说，我哥哥总是坚持自己的风格。
[00:29:26.480] And I do think like with the art thing as well, it helps us connect on that.
[00:29:26.480] 而且我觉得艺术方面也是如此，它能帮助我们建立联系。
[00:29:30.720] Oh, yeah, that makes sense. When you were 14, how did your mom tell you that you had a new sibling
[00:29:30.720] 哦，对，这说得通。你14岁的时候，你妈妈是怎么告诉你你多了个弟弟妹妹的？
[00:29:37.660] coming? This was so long ago. Was it like impactful? Or was it just like, oh, okay.
[00:29:37.660] 来了？这都过去好久了。这件事影响很大吗？还是只是，哦，好吧？
[00:29:45.220] I think it was more so impactful when my mom told us that she was getting remarried. I think that was
[00:29:45.220] 我觉得最让我震惊的是妈妈告诉我们她要再婚的消息。我觉得那是
[00:29:52.460] more of the impactful part. And then I think her having a kid was kind of like expected. So I don't
[00:29:52.460] 更重要的是影响深远的部分。而且我觉得她生孩子也算是意料之中的事。所以我不
[00:29:59.100] really think it was that super impactful. But maybe more so the remarrying that was that impactful part.
[00:29:59.100] 我觉得这件事影响真的很大。但或许再婚这件事的影响更大。
[00:30:06.660] I think that makes sense. You're more shocked about the remarriage part. And then when she's like,
[00:30:06.660] 我觉得这说得通。你更震惊的是她再婚这件事。然后当她说，
[00:30:11.700] oh, I'm gonna have a kid, you guys are gonna have a sibling. You're kind of like, okay, well,
[00:30:11.700] 哦，我要生孩子了，你们也要有弟弟或妹妹了。你可能会想，好吧，
[00:30:16.060] I guess that just follows marriage naturally.
[00:30:16.060] 我想这大概是婚姻自然而然带来的吧。
[00:30:18.240] Yeah, I kind of feel like if I had to think about it, we were maybe like kind of excited about it.
[00:30:18.240] 是的，如果非要我回忆一下的话，我觉得我们当时可能还挺兴奋的。
[00:30:24.620] Even, you know, whenever we were able to find out that my sister was a girl, they're non-binary now.
[00:30:24.620] 你知道，即使我们后来发现我妹妹是女孩，她们现在也是非二元性别者了。
[00:30:32.660] But when we found out that they were a girl, me and my brother had never had a sister. And I know my
[00:30:32.660] 但当我们发现是个女孩时，我和哥哥才知道我们以前从来没有过妹妹。我知道我的
[00:30:40.440] mom also wanted a daughter. So I think everyone was pretty excited.
[00:30:40.440] 妈妈也想要个女儿。所以我觉得大家都挺兴奋的。
[00:30:46.220] Oh, that's cute. That is cute. I also wonder if it's because you had each other already. Like,
[00:30:46.220] 哦，真可爱。真的好可爱。我也在想，是不是因为你们彼此已经拥有了对方。就像，
[00:30:52.060] I feel like going from an only child to having a sibling is like a huge leap. But having one sibling
[00:30:52.060] 我觉得从独生子女到有兄弟姐妹就像是一次巨大的飞跃。但是，有一个兄弟姐妹就够了。
[00:30:57.980] to having two siblings maybe wouldn't be as shocking. Right? Yeah, I can kind of imagine
[00:30:57.980] 如果自己有两个兄弟姐妹，也许就不会那么令人惊讶了。对吧？嗯，我大概能想象到。
[00:31:03.400] that if you went from having no siblings to one sibling, it would be pretty shocking. But it's
[00:31:03.400] 如果你从没有兄弟姐妹突然变成只有一个兄弟姐妹，那确实会让人非常震惊。但事实并非如此。
[00:31:10.260] not as bad because you don't need to like share your stuff as much because you know,
[00:31:10.260] 没那么糟糕，因为你不需要像以前那样分享你的东西，因为你知道，
[00:31:14.200] there's not much stuff that can be shared between siblings that are of a 14 year age again.
[00:31:14.200] 14岁的兄弟姐妹之间能分享的东西并不多。
[00:31:18.860] Oh, yeah. You know, you're not like sharing food,
[00:31:18.860] 哦，是啊。你知道，你们不像是会分享食物的人。
[00:31:20.740] like baby food or not sharing like, like clothes or like toys and playtime. You know,
[00:31:20.740] 就像婴儿食品，或者不分享一些东西，比如衣服、玩具和玩耍时间。你知道的。
[00:31:26.860] you don't even share like time on the video game. Something that was pretty interesting being 14
[00:31:26.860] 你们甚至都不一起玩电子游戏。这在我14岁的时候挺有意思的。
[00:31:32.160] and having a sibling that young was that like, you know, when you have a sibling kind of like takes
[00:31:32.160] 有个那么小的弟弟妹妹，你知道，就像，当你有了弟弟妹妹之后，会感觉……
[00:31:39.260] up all the attention from your parents for better or for worse. I think I had a very like independent
[00:31:39.260] 无论好坏，都要争取父母所有的关注。我觉得我非常独立。
[00:31:45.020] teenage life. You know, I was kind of like doing my own thing. Kind of had free reign over what I
[00:31:45.020] 青少年时期。你知道，我当时基本上是随心所欲，想做什么就做什么，几乎完全不受约束。
[00:31:50.820] wanted to do. Maybe that was a bad thing. But it's okay. You turned out okay. Yeah. But I mean,
[00:31:50.820] 想做的事。也许那是件坏事。但没关系。你最终也过得不错。是啊。但我的意思是，
[00:31:58.760] I think I had a fun teenager life. So I think I'm grateful for it. But yeah, that was a pretty
[00:31:58.760] 我觉得我的青少年时期过得很开心，所以我很感激。不过，那段时光确实相当……
[00:32:03.560] interesting byproduct of having a sibling at that age. That's true. Now that I think about it,
[00:32:03.560] 那个年纪有个兄弟姐妹，真是个有趣的意外收获。确实如此。现在想想，
[00:32:09.520] sometimes when we went to hang out at your place, your sister might have been sleeping,
[00:32:09.520] 有时候我们去你家玩的时候，你妹妹可能正在睡觉。
[00:32:15.020] or we didn't always see them running around because they were literally just like a toddler
[00:32:15.020] 或者我们并非总能看到他们到处跑来跑去，因为他们当时真的就像个蹒跚学步的孩子。
[00:32:20.740] or a baby. And so I feel like your parents were usually very busy with your sister as well. So
[00:32:20.740] 或者照顾婴儿。所以我感觉你父母平时也很忙，还要照顾你妹妹。
[00:32:28.360] yeah, when I envisioned Destin, teenage Destin, it's kind of what you described. Destin's always
[00:32:28.360] 是的，我设想的德斯汀，少年时期的德斯汀，有点像你描述的那样。德斯汀总是
[00:32:34.340] free to do whatever he wants. So we talked a little bit about how you took care of your sister a little
[00:32:34.340] 他可以自由自在地做任何他想做的事。所以我们稍微聊了聊你是如何照顾你妹妹的。
[00:32:41.280] bit when she was young. Do you know how to like change a diaper and stuff? Like how extensive is
[00:32:41.280] 她小时候就有点儿。你知道怎么换尿布之类的吗？比如，具体要学多少？
[00:32:46.680] your knowledge of taking care of a baby slash toddler? Don't think I ever changed their diaper.
[00:32:46.680] 你懂照顾婴儿/幼儿吗？我好像从来没给他们换过尿布。
[00:32:55.180] And you know, it's been a very long time since they've worn diapers. So I don't even think probably
[00:32:55.180] 你知道，他们已经很久没穿尿布了。所以我甚至觉得可能
[00:33:00.440] my parents know. But yeah, like I was saying earlier, of course, my parents did a lot of the
[00:33:00.440] 我父母知道。但是，就像我之前说的，当然，我父母做了很多……
[00:33:05.500] changing diapers, cleaning up poop, putting them to sleep, feeding them and everything.
[00:33:05.500] 换尿布、清理粪便、哄他们睡觉、喂他们吃饭等等。
[00:33:11.120] In terms of, you know, taking care of them, at least now it's just mostly like helping them with
[00:33:11.120] 至于照顾他们方面，至少现在主要是帮助他们……
[00:33:16.620] going places, you know, driving them places. I remember I taught them math for a little bit,
[00:33:16.620] 带他们去各种地方，你知道，开车送他们去。我记得我还教过他们一会儿数学。
[00:33:22.320] which was pretty infuriating. No.
[00:33:22.320] 这真是令人恼火。不。
[00:33:27.540] Yeah, I taught them school subjects. And that was pretty, you know, helpful for my parents,
[00:33:27.540] 是的，我教他们学校的科目。这对我的父母来说很有帮助。
[00:33:32.700] because, you know, they're not familiar with the school subjects as well as I am, you know,
[00:33:32.700] 因为，你知道，他们不像我一样熟悉学校的科目。
[00:33:37.280] because it's pretty like, relatively more recent in knowledge, especially since I also went to
[00:33:37.280] 因为这方面的知识相对较新，尤其是我还去过……
[00:33:41.960] the same high school as them. So I would help them a lot. But that was also like another thing where
[00:33:41.960] 我和他们上的是同一所高中。所以我帮了他们很多忙。但这同时也是另一件事，
[00:33:48.940] it's like, I'm not like joking around as much. It's kind of like I'm trying to teach you like math,
[00:33:48.940] 感觉我不太像以前那样开玩笑了。我好像在教你数学似的。
[00:33:54.680] you need to like learn how to do this formula. Oh my god, I'm just imagining you trying to teach
[00:33:54.680] 你得好好学学怎么用这个公式。我的天哪，我都能想象你教别人怎么用这个公式的样子了。
[00:33:59.700] them math. And they're like, Oh my god, look at these memes.
[00:33:59.700] 他们看数学题。然后他们会说，我的天哪，看看这些梗图。
[00:34:05.320] Yeah, when I'm teaching them stuff, of course, when you're like learning something, it's going to be
[00:34:05.320] 是的，当我教他们东西的时候，当然，当你学习某些东西的时候，就会出现这种情况。
[00:34:09.500] like difficult. You know, you see a very different side of them when they're like trying their best
[00:34:09.500] 就像很难一样。你知道，当他们竭尽全力的时候，你会看到他们截然不同的一面。
[00:34:14.600] to do something and maybe it's not like working out. Yeah, that's just a different thing that I
[00:34:14.600] 做点什么，也许不是像锻炼那样。是啊，那完全是另一回事。
[00:34:19.740] don't normally see day to day, you know, because we're normally just like joking a lot.
[00:34:19.740] 平时很少见面，你知道，因为我们平时经常开玩笑。
[00:34:23.500] And then also just like, you know, advice, talking to people like, you know, in high school and stuff.
[00:34:23.500] 然后还有就是，你知道，给别人一些建议，和高中同学聊聊之类的。
[00:34:28.600] That's also something that my parents probably cannot help as well because they don't know
[00:34:28.600] 这一点我的父母可能也帮不上忙，因为他们并不了解。
[00:34:33.160] being a teenager and being like in high school as well as I do.
[00:34:33.160] 作为一个十几岁的青少年，就像我一样，也像高中生一样。
[00:34:37.760] Oh my god, have you ever made them cry?
[00:34:37.760] 我的天哪，你有没有把他们弄哭过？
[00:34:40.640] I actually don't think I have.
[00:34:40.640] 我其实觉得我没有。
[00:34:42.920] Okay, I was kind of thinking that because if your age gap is like so large,
[00:34:42.920] 好吧，我当时在想，如果你们的年龄差距这么大的话，
[00:34:46.860] there's also I think more respect coming from the younger sibling.
[00:34:46.860] 我觉得弟弟妹妹之间也更加尊重对方。
[00:34:51.700] Well, hopefully. And I feel like there's
[00:34:51.700] 但愿如此。我觉得应该有办法。
[00:34:54.820] less opportunity, I guess, to make each other cry
[00:34:54.820] 我想，这样一来，彼此哭泣的机会就少了。
[00:34:58.900] just because you being kind of a mature adult
[00:34:58.900] 就因为你是个比较成熟的成年人。
[00:35:02.880] now, it's like, oh, I'll try to be gentle with
[00:35:02.880] 现在，感觉就像，哦，我会尽量温柔一些。
[00:35:05.580] them and like not be too harsh.
[00:35:05.580] 对他们不要太苛刻。
[00:35:09.280] Meanwhile, I'm, you know, like having a sibling that's much closer in age,
[00:35:09.280] 与此同时，你知道，我感觉就像多了一个年龄相仿的兄弟姐妹。
[00:35:13.120] I feel like me and my brother.
[00:35:13.120] 我感觉自己像我和我哥哥。
[00:35:15.500] Okay, I don't know if I ever made him cry, but like he definitely has made me cry.
[00:35:15.500] 好吧，我不知道我有没有让他哭过，但他肯定让我哭过。
[00:35:21.380] Yeah, definitely.
[00:35:21.380] 是的，当然。
[00:35:22.600] What did he do that made you cry?
[00:35:22.600] 他做了什么让你哭了？
[00:35:24.600] I don't know. Just like be mean.
[00:35:24.600] 我不知道。就是喜欢刻薄。
[00:35:27.320] Damn.
[00:35:27.320] 该死。
[00:35:30.380] I have a kind of a funny question for you both.
[00:35:30.380] 我有个有点搞笑的问题想问你们俩。
[00:35:33.540] If your parents came up to you right now and were like,
[00:35:33.540] 如果你的父母现在走过来对你说：
[00:35:38.140] were expecting a child,
[00:35:38.140] 我们即将迎来一个孩子，
[00:35:41.000] whoa, how would you feel about having a sibling
[00:35:41.000] 哇，你觉得有个兄弟姐妹怎么样？
[00:35:45.180] with a 28 year age gap?
[00:35:45.180] 年龄相差28岁？
[00:35:48.700] Oh my god.
[00:35:48.700] 我的天啊。
[00:35:51.440] I mean, at this point, it's like training us for parenthood, right?
[00:35:51.440] 我的意思是，到了现在，这就像是训练我们为为人父母一样，对吧？
[00:35:55.940] At this point?
[00:35:55.940] 在此刻？
[00:35:56.660] Yeah.
[00:35:56.660] 是的。
[00:35:58.800] You know, for Jisoo, she doesn't even have siblings.
[00:35:58.800] 你知道吗，Jisoo 甚至连兄弟姐妹都没有。
[00:36:01.320] So she might as well treat this as a child.
[00:36:01.320] 所以她不妨把这件事当成孩子一样对待。
[00:36:04.100] There's no point in trying to learn what it's like to be a sibling.
[00:36:04.100] 试图了解做兄弟姐妹是什么感觉是没有意义的。
[00:36:09.060] True.
[00:36:09.060] 真的。
[00:36:09.900] Yeah, it's like not even a sibling anymore.
[00:36:09.900] 是啊，感觉就像不再是兄弟姐妹了。
[00:36:11.940] It's just your child.
[00:36:11.940] 这只是你的孩子。
[00:36:14.180] Your child adjacent.
[00:36:14.180] 你的孩子就在旁边。
[00:36:15.940] What would I think?
[00:36:15.940] 我会怎么想？
[00:36:16.780] I would think that it would be really funny for my sister
[00:36:16.780] 我觉得我妹妹会觉得很好笑。
[00:36:19.880] because now they get to, I guess, experience the same thing
[00:36:19.880] 因为现在他们也能体验到同样的事情了。
[00:36:26.260] that I went through.
[00:36:26.260] 我经历过的。
[00:36:27.700] Not that it was a bad thing, but just this very unique experience
[00:36:27.700] 倒不是说这是件坏事，只是这段经历非常独特。
[00:36:31.600] of having such a large age gap sibling.
[00:36:31.600] 有个年龄差距很大的兄弟姐妹。
[00:36:35.240] Yeah, because then when they're like 28,
[00:36:35.240] 是啊，因为等他们到了28岁左右的时候，
[00:36:38.200] then the fourth and final sibling would be 14.
[00:36:38.200] 那么，第四个也是最后一个兄弟姐妹就14岁了。
[00:36:42.140] Oh my god.
[00:36:42.140] 我的天啊。
[00:36:44.060] Jisoo's like so in shock.
[00:36:44.060] Jisoo看起来非常震惊。
[00:36:45.440] She can't even answer this question about it.
[00:36:45.440] 她甚至无法回答这个问题。
[00:36:47.960] I know.
[00:36:47.960] 我知道。
[00:36:48.340] I'm speechless.
[00:36:48.340] 我无语了。
[00:36:50.800] I mean, honestly, I would be like, okay, at that point,
[00:36:50.800] 说实话，到了那个时候，我大概会想，好吧，
[00:36:53.520] this is, like Dustin said, just my kid.
[00:36:53.520] 正如达斯汀所说，这只是我的孩子。
[00:36:56.060] I will be taking care of this new soul.
[00:36:56.060] 我会好好照顾这个新生命。
[00:36:58.540] But also, you guys know Al Pacino?
[00:36:58.540] 但是，你们也认识阿尔·帕西诺吧？
[00:37:02.680] Yeah.
[00:37:02.680] 是的。
[00:37:03.120] He had a kid at 83.
[00:37:03.120] 他83岁才有了孩子。
[00:37:06.540] Whoa.
[00:37:06.540] 哇。
[00:37:07.400] And he has multiple kids already.
[00:37:07.400] 他已经有好几个孩子了。
[00:37:10.260] So low-key, his children are probably going through that
[00:37:10.260] 所以，低调地说，他的孩子们可能正在经历这些。
[00:37:13.480] where his oldest kid is maybe like 40 or some shit.
[00:37:13.480] 他最大的孩子可能都40岁左右了。
[00:37:16.520] That is kind of how families of celebrities work, right?
[00:37:16.520] 名人家庭的运作方式大致就是这样，对吧？
[00:37:20.500] A lot of celebrities remarry a lot
[00:37:20.500] 很多名人经常再婚。
[00:37:23.160] and then will have a new child with their new spouse.
[00:37:23.160] 然后他们会和新配偶再生一个孩子。
[00:37:27.060] So that's kind of normal for that side of the world.
[00:37:27.060] 所以，这在世界那个地区算是比较正常的。
[00:37:31.500] Yeah.
[00:37:31.500] 是的。
[00:37:32.780] Okay, but also, Jisoo,
[00:37:32.780] 好的，还有，Jisoo，
[00:37:34.320] like you wouldn't be taking care of that sibling
[00:37:34.320] 就好像你不会照顾你的兄弟姐妹一样
[00:37:36.740] because your parents live in a different state.
[00:37:36.740] 因为你的父母住在另一个州。
[00:37:40.340] So when you visit, like that would be a sibling.
[00:37:40.340] 所以当你去看望他们时，就像是兄弟姐妹一样。
[00:37:43.440] Oh.
[00:37:43.440] 哦。
[00:37:44.160] I guess that's true.
[00:37:44.160] 我想确实如此。
[00:37:46.520] God, I don't know.
[00:37:46.520] 天哪，我不知道。
[00:37:47.940] At that point, you're just like cousins.
[00:37:47.940] 到那时，你们就跟表亲一样了。
[00:37:49.680] Oh my god.
[00:37:49.680] 我的天啊。
[00:37:50.540] You're siblings, but you treat them like a cousin.
[00:37:50.540] 你们是亲兄妹，但你们待他们如同表兄妹一般。
[00:37:53.720] And then it's crazy because like every time you see them,
[00:37:53.720] 然后就更疯狂了，因为每次你看到他们，
[00:37:56.420] they're like a different person, you know?
[00:37:56.420] 他们就像变了个人似的，你知道吗？
[00:37:58.020] They grow up like a whole year.
[00:37:58.020] 他们长大了，就像过了一整年。
[00:37:59.780] And then at that age, they're like a different,
[00:37:59.780] 到了那个年纪，他们就像变了一个人，
[00:38:02.120] they're like a completely different person from year to year.
[00:38:02.120] 他们每年都像变了一个人似的。
[00:38:05.600] Dude, but would you not like get jealous?
[00:38:05.600] 兄弟，你难道不会嫉妒吗？
[00:38:07.880] You go home, your parents are like fawning over this child.
[00:38:07.880] 你回到家，你父母就像在哄小孩一样哄着这个孩子。
[00:38:11.580] Like what about you?
[00:38:11.580] 你呢？
[00:38:13.720] No, I have experience because we used to have a dog.
[00:38:13.720] 不，我有这方面的经验，因为我们以前养过狗。
[00:38:16.700] So, you know, it's like the same thing.
[00:38:16.700] 所以，你知道，这其实是一样的。
[00:38:19.280] Right.
[00:38:19.280] 正确的。
[00:38:19.720] Well, I guess, Jisoo, how would you feel if your parents were to give this child something,
[00:38:19.720] 智秀，我想问问你，如果你的父母送给这个孩子什么东西，你会作何感想？
[00:38:26.580] like I said, easier or like earlier than they did for you?
[00:38:26.580] 就像我说的，对你来说是不是更容易或者更早？
[00:38:31.440] Would you feel like resentful?
[00:38:31.440] 你会感到怨恨吗？
[00:38:33.320] Or would you be like, I'm happy that they could have it this easy?
[00:38:33.320] 或者你会说，我很高兴他们能这么轻松地过上好日子？
[00:38:39.500] God, I don't know.
[00:38:39.500] 天哪，我不知道。
[00:38:40.440] I mean, I'm sure there are things that I can think of that would make me feel resentful.
[00:38:40.440] 我的意思是，我肯定能想到一些让我感到怨恨的事情。
[00:38:44.540] I can't pinpoint any right now, but I think I would feel resentful.
[00:38:44.540] 我现在还说不出具体是哪些，但我认为我会感到愤恨。
[00:38:48.820] But I feel so uncomfortable right now.
[00:38:48.820] 但我现在感觉很不自在。
[00:38:50.480] This is crazy.
[00:38:50.480] 这太疯狂了。
[00:38:51.440] I feel like I haven't had to think about the thought of,
[00:38:51.440] 我觉得我好像从来不用去想这件事，
[00:38:54.940] oh, how would you feel if your parents asked if you wanted a sibling in so long?
[00:38:54.940] 哦，如果你的父母问你是否想要个弟弟或妹妹，你会作何感想？
[00:39:00.100] What is your gut feeling imagining your parents saying to this child,
[00:39:00.100] 你想象中父母会对这个孩子说什么？
[00:39:05.240] I'm proud of you?
[00:39:05.240] 我为你感到骄傲？
[00:39:06.560] What?
[00:39:06.560] 什么？
[00:39:16.440] That's crazy.
[00:39:16.440] 太疯狂了。
[00:39:20.660] Yeah, I would probably be uncomfortable.
[00:39:20.660] 是的，我可能会觉得不自在。
[00:39:22.920] Okay.
[00:39:22.920] 好的。
[00:39:23.380] Actually, what would make me uncomfortable is not like the things or like, you know, the words.
[00:39:23.380] 其实，让我感到不舒服的并不是那些东西，也不是那些话。
[00:39:27.640] But if I were to go back home and be like, hey, mom and dad, me right now,
[00:39:27.640] 但如果我回到家，跟爸妈说：“嘿，爸妈，这是我现在的样子”，
[00:39:31.740] they would be super happy to see me.
[00:39:31.740] 他们见到我会非常高兴。
[00:39:33.380] But if I went back and they were just like so preoccupied with this baby,
[00:39:33.380] 但如果我回去的时候，他们却一心只想照顾这个孩子，
[00:39:37.420] I would be like, what the fuck?
[00:39:37.420] 我当时会想，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:39:39.340] I'm here.
[00:39:39.340] 我在这里。
[00:39:40.080] Like, it's just a fucking baby.
[00:39:40.080] 他就是个婴儿而已。
[00:39:43.880] Dude, they would definitely be like, oh, hey, Jisoo, you're back.
[00:39:43.880] 兄弟，他们肯定会说，哦，嘿，Jisoo，你回来了。
[00:39:48.020] And immediately put you to work.
[00:39:48.020] 然后立即安排你工作。
[00:39:49.980] No, your parents?
[00:39:49.980] 不，是你父母吗？
[00:39:50.840] No, you should be like, dude, you barely know this person.
[00:39:50.840] 不，你应该想，兄弟，你跟这个人几乎不熟。
[00:39:54.080] You've known them for two years.
[00:39:54.080] 你认识他们两年了。
[00:39:55.800] You've known me for 28 years.
[00:39:55.800] 你认识我28年了。
[00:39:58.120] There's no way.
[00:39:58.120] 不可能。
[00:39:59.900] There's no way you like them that much.
[00:39:59.900] 你不可能那么喜欢他们。
[00:40:02.740] I'm like, dude, broke any of the lock yet.
[00:40:02.740] 我心想，老兄，你还没把锁撬开吗？
[00:40:05.240] Like, the fuck?
[00:40:05.240] 这他妈什么鬼？
[00:40:06.860] They can't even say a word.
[00:40:06.860] 他们连一句话都说不出来。
[00:40:08.160] What conversation can this guy even hold?
[00:40:08.160] 这家伙到底能进行什么对话？
[00:40:13.120] That would be crazy, though, because something that Jisoo said earlier rings true.
[00:40:13.120] 但这太疯狂了，因为Jisoo之前说的有些话很有道理。
[00:40:18.720] Like, Dustin, you have pretty much always been the older sibling.
[00:40:18.720] 达斯汀，你几乎一直都是哥哥/姐姐的角色。
[00:40:23.100] Because when you find out when you're four, you're like barely conscious.
[00:40:23.100] 因为当你四岁的时候发现自己身处险境，你几乎还没意识到发生了什么。
[00:40:27.000] You're like barely realizing the weight of that.
[00:40:27.000] 你似乎几乎没有意识到这件事的重量。
[00:40:30.060] So technically, like your whole life, you've been the older sibling.
[00:40:30.060] 所以严格来说，就像你一生中一直都是哥哥姐姐一样。
[00:40:34.320] But in the case of, you know, bigger age gaps, if there's only two siblings, then the older sibling, you know, spent X amount of years being an only child.
[00:40:34.320] 但是，如果年龄差距较大，只有两个兄弟姐妹，那么哥哥姐姐就经历了 X 年的独生子女生活。
[00:40:44.280] And then they have to start learning to be an older sibling, which is kind of crazy to think about.
[00:40:44.280] 然后他们还得开始学习如何做一个哥哥姐姐，想想都觉得不可思议。
[00:40:49.800] Yeah.
[00:40:49.800] 是的。
[00:40:51.180] Yeah.
[00:40:51.180] 是的。
[00:40:51.300] What would the things that you have to do?
[00:40:51.300] 你需要做些什么？
[00:40:52.920] It's like sharing, but then, you know, when the age gap is that big, you're not sharing stuff.
[00:40:52.920] 这就像分享，但是，你知道，当年龄差距那么大时，你们就无法分享东西了。
[00:40:57.360] Maybe being like, maybe being like patient.
[00:40:57.360] 或许像，或许像个耐心的人。
[00:41:01.060] Yeah.
[00:41:01.060] 是的。
[00:41:01.460] I don't know.
[00:41:01.460] 我不知道。
[00:41:02.800] I say it like that, but it's just things that, you know, that I've noticed my girlfriend know from me.
[00:41:02.800] 我是这么说的，但其实就是一些我注意到女朋友从我这里了解到的事情。
[00:41:12.620] No, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:41:12.620] 不，我觉得完全正确。
[00:41:14.600] Being patient.
[00:41:14.600] 要有耐心。
[00:41:15.940] And there's just like little things.
[00:41:15.940] 还有一些小事。
[00:41:17.940] So my boyfriend is an older sibling as well.
[00:41:17.940] 所以我的男朋友也是个哥哥。
[00:41:21.040] And their age gap is about four years as well.
[00:41:21.040] 而且他们的年龄差也大约是四岁。
[00:41:25.580] Sometimes his younger sister will call him when she doesn't know what to do.
[00:41:25.580] 有时他妹妹不知道该怎么办的时候会给他打电话。
[00:41:30.880] And I was like, oh, that's like kind of cute.
[00:41:30.880] 我当时就想，哦，这还挺可爱的。
[00:41:33.260] But I was also like, I would never do that.
[00:41:33.260] 但我当时也想，我绝对不会那样做。
[00:41:35.600] Like I would never call my older brother in times of need.
[00:41:35.600] 就像我永远不会在需要的时候打电话给我的哥哥一样。
[00:41:39.500] For the most part, I don't have a reason to.
[00:41:39.500] 大多数情况下，我没有理由这样做。
[00:41:42.560] But she was like literally calling him for like advice.
[00:41:42.560] 但她当时就像是在打电话向他寻求建议一样。
[00:41:45.600] I thought about it.
[00:41:45.600] 我考虑了一下。
[00:41:46.420] I was like, wow, that's like such little sibling behavior.
[00:41:46.420] 我当时就想，哇，这简直就像小弟弟小妹妹的行为一样。
[00:41:48.780] Like it's very cute, you know?
[00:41:48.780] 它真的很可爱，你知道吗？
[00:41:50.880] Yeah.
[00:41:50.880] 是的。
[00:41:51.840] Have you ever taken note of anything that your boyfriend does that is like, oh, I've never thought of doing that?
[00:41:51.840] 你有没有注意到你男朋友做的一些事情，让你觉得“哦，我从来没想过这样做”？
[00:41:59.620] I guess that's one thing.
[00:41:59.620] 我想这算是其中一点吧。
[00:42:00.780] But he takes his younger sister like grocery shopping and like drives her around and stuff.
[00:42:00.780] 但他会带他妹妹去买菜，开车带她到处逛逛之类的。
[00:42:07.900] And I'm like, that's very nice of you.
[00:42:07.900] 我当时就想，你真是太好了。
[00:42:12.780] Actually, I think Crystal, you did take your older brother grocery shopping and like drive him around.
[00:42:12.780] 其实，Crystal，我觉得你确实带你哥哥去买过东西，还开车带他到处转转。
[00:42:18.040] Well, not grocery shopping, but I did learn to drive earlier in my lifetime than he did.
[00:42:18.040] 嗯，虽然不是去超市买菜，但我学会开车的时间确实比他早。
[00:42:25.160] So in college, we both went to UCSD and I basically took ownership of the car.
[00:42:25.160] 所以上大学时，我们俩都去了加州大学圣地亚哥分校，我基本上就拥有了那辆车。
[00:42:31.900] But I think that's an older sibling thing.
[00:42:31.900] 但我认为这是兄姐之间才会有的想法。
[00:42:35.300] Like Max just let me like take ownership of the car because by that time he he could drive as well.
[00:42:35.300] 就像Max让我拥有了这辆车一样，因为那时他自己也会开车了。
[00:42:41.680] But he never complained and just let me like always use the car pretty much.
[00:42:41.680] 但他从未抱怨过，基本上还是像往常一样让我用车。
[00:42:48.440] Once Max asked me to take him to Zion and drive him around.
[00:42:48.440] 有一次，Max 让我带他去锡安国家公园，开车带他四处转转。
[00:42:51.780] Oh my God.
[00:42:51.780] 我的天啊。
[00:42:52.600] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:42:52.600] 等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:42:54.720] That's really funny.
[00:42:54.720] 真好笑。
[00:42:56.320] Because we all live together.
[00:42:56.320] 因为我们都生活在一起。
[00:42:57.940] Yeah.
[00:42:57.940] 是的。
[00:42:58.900] Dude, that was your moment of older siblingship.
[00:42:58.900] 兄弟，那是你展现兄长风范的时刻。
[00:43:03.440] Was it?
[00:43:03.440] 是吗？
[00:43:04.280] Oh, like I was older.
[00:43:04.280] 哦，好像我年纪更大似的。
[00:43:05.460] Yeah, you're right.
[00:43:05.460] 是的，你说得对。
[00:43:08.320] Okay.
[00:43:08.320] 好的。
[00:43:08.980] So last question for you, Dustin.
[00:43:08.980] 达斯汀，最后一个问题。
[00:43:11.560] You have quite a lot of experience with siblings in your own personal family.
[00:43:11.560] 你在自己的家庭中与兄弟姐妹相处方面很有经验。
[00:43:17.180] So when you think about having your own children, do you think you want to have three kids just like your family?
[00:43:17.180] 所以，当你考虑要不要生孩子的时候，你是不是也想生三个孩子，就像你家一样？
[00:43:25.900] Or what do you think the ideal setup is?
[00:43:25.900] 或者，你认为理想的配置是什么？
[00:43:29.900] I definitely do not want an only child.
[00:43:29.900] 我绝对不想生独生子。
[00:43:36.600] For L for not just me, but for your girlfriend, for my husband.
[00:43:36.600] 献给L，不仅是为了我，也是为了你的女朋友，为了我的丈夫。
[00:43:40.880] That sounds like such a mean thing to say.
[00:43:40.880] 这话听起来真刻薄。
[00:43:46.360] I think growing up with siblings, you just like learn a lot.
[00:43:46.360] 我觉得和兄弟姐妹一起长大，能学到很多东西。
[00:43:50.800] It's like the saying.
[00:43:50.800] 就像那句谚语说的那样。
[00:43:52.180] I don't know if you've heard of this lifelong saying, but is it easier to take care of one dog or nine dogs?
[00:43:52.180] 我不知道你是否听过这句流传已久的谚语，但是照顾一只狗更容易还是照顾九只狗更容易呢？
[00:43:58.220] Oh, it's like the same basically.
[00:43:58.220] 哦，基本上是一样的。
[00:43:59.760] Yeah, is it easier to take care of one kid or nine kids?
[00:43:59.760] 是啊，照顾一个孩子容易还是照顾九个孩子容易？
[00:44:03.640] Because when it's nine kids...
[00:44:03.640] 因为如果有九个孩子……
[00:44:04.920] One.
[00:44:04.920] 一。
[00:44:05.360] Okay.
[00:44:05.360] 好的。
[00:44:05.980] It doesn't work the same as kids, but you know, nine dogs, they kind of take care of each other.
[00:44:05.980] 虽然和孩子不一样，但是你知道，九只狗，它们会互相照顾。
[00:44:11.140] It's spoken by someone that's never owned a dog.
[00:44:11.140] 说话的人从未养过狗。
[00:44:13.760] But yeah, I think ideally my envision, if I were to have kids, I'm still not sure if I will have kids.
[00:44:13.760] 但是，是的，我的理想设想是，如果我要孩子的话，我仍然不确定我是否会要孩子。
[00:44:21.720] But I think I would want probably two children, maybe three.
[00:44:21.720] 但我认为我可能会想要两个孩子，也许三个。
[00:44:27.160] Okay, I've never taken care of actual my own children yet, but I think having siblings for your children would be very helpful for everyone.
[00:44:27.160] 好吧，我还没有真正照顾过自己的孩子，但我认为对孩子们来说，有兄弟姐妹对每个人都很有帮助。
[00:44:37.440] And, you know, of course, I think it's very fun as well.
[00:44:37.440] 当然，我也觉得这很有趣。
[00:44:39.960] Would you give them a big age gap?
[00:44:39.960] 你会接受他们之间较大的年龄差距吗？
[00:44:42.800] Oh, that's kind of interesting.
[00:44:42.800] 哦，这挺有意思的。
[00:44:43.980] If I could have the choice.
[00:44:43.980] 如果让我选择的话。
[00:44:45.980] I mean, that's not really like a choice thing, right?
[00:44:45.980] 我的意思是，这其实算不上什么选择，对吧？
[00:44:48.960] It's not something you plan for.
[00:44:48.960] 这是无法提前计划的。
[00:44:50.640] Right, right.
[00:44:50.640] 对，对。
[00:44:51.440] True.
[00:44:51.440] 真的。
[00:44:52.660] Wait, age gap I think you can definitely plan for.
[00:44:52.660] 等等，年龄差距我觉得完全可以提前计划。
[00:44:56.040] Or at least try to plan for.
[00:44:56.040] 或者至少尝试做好计划。
[00:44:58.420] It's not like gender choosing.
[00:44:58.420] 这跟选择性别不一样。
[00:45:00.520] Okay, okay.
[00:45:00.520] 好的，好的。
[00:45:01.000] Let me think if I could like build my life and plan to have...
[00:45:01.000] 让我想想，如果我能规划自己的人生，拥有……
[00:45:05.160] Honestly, maybe it's like not bad because it's like the youngest sibling.
[00:45:05.160] 说实话，也许还不错，因为它就像是家里最小的弟弟妹妹。
[00:45:09.560] You know, you have older siblings to help take care of them.
[00:45:09.560] 你知道，你有哥哥姐姐可以帮忙照顾他们。
[00:45:13.460] And they're like, you know, they're old enough where you don't need to be cleaning out their poop.
[00:45:13.460] 而且他们就像，你知道，他们已经足够大了，不需要你再去清理他们的粪便了。
[00:45:16.760] So they can start cleaning up poop.
[00:45:16.760] 这样他们就可以开始清理粪便了。
[00:45:19.700] So...
[00:45:19.700] 所以...
[00:45:20.260] That's true.
[00:45:20.260] 这是真的。
[00:45:20.800] It's like a little less chaotic at once.
[00:45:20.800] 感觉一下子没那么混乱了。
[00:45:23.680] Honestly, the idea of it does not sound bad.
[00:45:23.680] 说实话，这个想法听起来还不错。
[00:45:26.740] But also the idea of, you know, having children and then being in parenthood and being like 15 years in like, all right, let's do it again.
[00:45:26.740] 但还有这样的想法，你知道，生孩子，然后为人父母，15 年后，好吧，我们再来一次吧。
[00:45:37.500] Like that is what sounds a little crazy.
[00:45:37.500] 这听起来确实有点疯狂。
[00:45:42.040] Honestly, yeah.
[00:45:42.040] 说实话，是的。
[00:45:43.080] It's like restarting a game after you've gone so far.
[00:45:43.080] 这就像玩了一段时间后重新开始游戏一样。
[00:45:46.740] A little bit.
[00:45:46.740] 一点点。
[00:45:47.340] That is more of the crazy thing to fathom.
[00:45:47.340] 这更令人难以置信。
[00:45:51.280] But I think the actual sibling relationship would be not bad.
[00:45:51.280] 但我认为他们真正的兄妹关系应该不会太差。
[00:45:54.920] I think it would be pretty good.
[00:45:54.920] 我觉得应该挺不错的。
[00:45:56.700] Well, as an only child, I felt like I took some L's this episode.
[00:45:56.700] 嗯，作为独生子女，我觉得我在这事上吃了不少亏。
[00:46:00.760] But it was very interesting to hear a little bit about your relationship with your sister and how the big age gap plays a role in your relationship.
[00:46:00.760] 但很高兴能听到一些关于你和你姐姐的关系，以及年龄差距在你们关系中扮演的角色。
