[00:00:00.240] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Balmeet.
[00:00:00.240] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Balmeet。
[00:00:17.030] Welcome Balmeet. Balmeet is a new voice on the podcast and we wanted to bring him on to chat about
[00:00:17.030] 欢迎 Balmeet。Balmeet 是播客的新成员，我们想请他来聊聊……
[00:00:25.710] unplugging and kind of also balancing your life with all of this technology constantly around us.
[00:00:25.710] 放下电子设备，在科技无处不在的环境中找到生活的平衡点。
[00:00:33.410] I think it's more and more on our minds lately, thinking about how to be more productive,
[00:00:33.410] 我觉得最近我们越来越关注这个问题，都在思考如何提高效率。
[00:00:41.350] how to like rot on the bed and couch less and not get so sucked into social media and technology and
[00:00:41.350] 如何减少在床上和沙发上的懒散时光，不至于沉迷于社交媒体和科技？
[00:00:49.450] all of that stuff. So we thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss. So I guess to start
[00:00:49.450] 所有这些。所以我们觉得这会是个有趣的话题。那么，我想就从这里开始吧。
[00:00:54.850] us off on a scale of one to 10, how chronically online do you think you are? Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:00:54.850] 如果用 1 到 10 分来衡量，你觉得自己有多沉迷网络？嗯，这真是个好问题。
[00:01:02.330] And I was thinking about this, probably like a seven or eight, which I don't know if that's the
[00:01:02.330] 我当时在想，大概是七八分吧，我不知道是不是这个分数。
[00:01:07.750] number that you were expecting per se. But I was thinking about it. What do I do where I don't
[00:01:07.750] 这并非你预期的数字。但我一直在思考。如果我没有……该怎么办？
[00:01:14.890] necessarily go online? Like social media is an obvious one where, you know, keep track of people's
[00:01:14.890] 一定要上网吗？比如社交媒体就是一个很明显的例子，你知道，人们可以通过社交媒体了解彼此的动态。
[00:01:19.330] lives where you just kind of like doom scrolling, rotting on the couch. Media, like in terms of sports
[00:01:19.330] 那种你整天窝在沙发上，漫无目的地浏览负面新闻的生活。媒体，比如体育媒体。
[00:01:26.810] or politics or whatever, you get most of that stuff online. Or at least I do games, shopping,
[00:01:26.810] 或者政治什么的，大部分东西你都能在网上找到。至少我玩游戏、购物什么的都是网上信息。
[00:01:33.650] I do a lot of stuff online, all of my hobbies, I kind of have a an avenue online. So I'm into climbing,
[00:01:33.650] 我经常上网，我的所有爱好，我都能在网上找到途径。比如，我喜欢攀岩。
[00:01:41.130] I got into chess, like during COVID. Those are some of the YouTubers I follow. And like, whenever
[00:01:41.130] 我大概是在新冠疫情期间开始下国际象棋的。这些是我关注的一些YouTube博主。而且，每当
[00:01:46.030] they come up with a video, like I'll keep track of that. There are a lot of things where I would say
[00:01:46.030] 他们会制作视频，我会关注的。有很多事情我都会说……
[00:01:49.330] that I'm chronically online for. But maybe just that's just how technology is today. We kind of
[00:01:49.330] 我经常上网。但也许这就是当今科技的现状。我们有点……
[00:01:55.950] use technology to get what you need for your different interests or your different needs.
[00:01:55.950] 运用科技来获取满足你不同兴趣或不同需求所需的东西。
[00:02:01.490] Yeah, that's a good point. I feel like as much as technology is supposed to be a tool for us,
[00:02:01.490] 是的，你说得对。我觉得科技虽然应该是我们的工具，
[00:02:07.150] it can just be a tool for us. But then my chronically online piece comes from always
[00:02:07.150] 它可以只是我们的一种工具。但我长期在线的习惯源于此。
[00:02:13.130] craving that screen time or like wanting that screen time. And sometimes I've had experiences
[00:02:13.130] 渴望或想要长时间盯着屏幕。有时我也有过这样的经历。
[00:02:18.490] where I'm at my computer for a long time. And I'm like, Oh, damn, my eyes hurt. Like I'm a little
[00:02:18.490] 我长时间坐在电脑前，然后就觉得，哎呀，眼睛好疼。感觉自己有点……
[00:02:22.350] tired, I should go rest. And then I'll lay down on the couch and pull up my phone, you know.
[00:02:22.350] 我累了，该休息了。然后我就躺在沙发上，拿出手机玩玩。
[00:02:26.550] So then in that sense, I feel like I'm probably like an eight or a nine.
[00:02:26.550] 所以从这个意义上讲，我觉得我大概是八九分吧。
[00:02:30.770] My screen time is pretty high. So it's a tough addiction to be.
[00:02:30.770] 我的屏幕使用时间很长，所以很难摆脱屏幕成瘾的困扰。
[00:02:36.010] Honestly, I'm probably similar to all of you floating around that upper end of seven to
[00:02:36.010] 说实话，我可能和你们这些七八岁左右的人差不多。
[00:02:42.150] eight or eight or nine. I spend a lot of screen time playing games watching TV. After I watch TV,
[00:02:42.150] 八、八、九岁。我花很多时间玩游戏、看电视。看完电视后，
[00:02:49.230] I have to like read about it, browse Reddit or like Twitter or whatever and see what everyone else is
[00:02:49.230] 我得看看相关资料，浏览Reddit、Twitter之类的平台，看看其他人怎么说。
[00:02:54.790] saying. Especially if it's like a good show. Sometimes the content that the viewers create
[00:02:54.790] 这么说吧。尤其像那种精彩的节目。有时候，观众创作的内容也很重要。
[00:03:00.590] is just as good as the show itself. It's easy to get really sucked into all of that.
[00:03:00.590] 和剧集本身一样精彩。很容易就会完全沉浸其中。
[00:03:05.810] Sometimes I think about it too. I'm like, what am I even doing online? What am I reading? What am I
[00:03:05.810] 有时候我也会想这个问题。我会想，我到底在网上干什么？我在看什么？我到底在干什么？
[00:03:10.230] wasting my time doing? And you can't even think of a topic. It's just like substance list sometimes.
[00:03:10.230] 浪费我的时间？你连个话题都想不出来。有时候就像列清单一样。
[00:03:16.790] But that's just how it is.
[00:03:16.790] 但事实就是如此。
[00:03:18.570] Yeah, I would definitely agree with that. I just finished watching Arcane. And the first thing I
[00:03:18.570] 是的，我完全同意。我刚看完《奥术》。看完之后，我首先想到的就是……
[00:03:22.530] did is just go on Reddit just to see what other people are saying about it.
[00:03:22.530] 我只是去Reddit上看看其他人是怎么说的。
[00:03:25.270] Yeah, totally. I've been reading so much about Arcane on like Reddit and Twitter and all of that.
[00:03:25.270] 是啊，完全同意。我一直在Reddit、Twitter之类的平台上看很多关于Arcane的讨论。
[00:03:30.770] People love to post theories, analyses, make fan art and make funny observations as well.
[00:03:30.770] 人们喜欢发表各种理论、分析，创作同人作品，以及发表一些有趣的评论。
[00:03:38.590] You go in thinking like, let me read a bit of what people are discussing. And the next thing you know,
[00:03:38.590] 你一开始想的是，让我看看大家都在讨论些什么。结果，你很快就发现，
[00:03:42.890] it's like four hours have passed and you're like, what have I been doing?
[00:03:42.890] 感觉好像过了四个小时，你会想，我这段时间都干了些什么？
[00:03:45.770] I mean, it truly is a content loop because I watch a lot of reality TV, which in itself has its own
[00:03:45.770] 我的意思是，这确实是一个内容循环，因为我看了很多真人秀节目，而真人秀本身就有其自身的循环。
[00:03:52.490] world of like content that people make. Oftentimes, I'll watch a show and I'll be like, holy shit,
[00:03:52.490] 这是一个充满人们创作的类似内容的世界。很多时候，我看完一个节目后会想，我的天哪，
[00:03:59.010] where's the tea? And then on TikTok or on Reddit or whatever, I'll consume a lot of like user
[00:03:59.010] 茶在哪儿？然后我会在TikTok、Reddit或其他什么平台上浏览很多点赞用户的内容。
[00:04:04.350] generated content. But sometimes it's the other way around too. I'll see like a couple of clips floating
[00:04:04.350] 生成的内容。但有时情况也正好相反。我会看到一些视频片段漂浮在空中。
[00:04:09.490] around of like some show. And that's how I get sucked into that franchise or that TV show. And I'll
[00:04:09.490] 就像看某个节目一样。我就是这样被某个系列电影或电视剧吸引住的。然后我会
[00:04:14.550] start to watch it. I feel like if you're kind of intentionally going and being like, oh, I want
[00:04:14.550] 开始看吧。我觉得如果你是特意去看，并且想着“哦，我想要”，那感觉就挺好的。
[00:04:19.350] to see what other users thought after they watched a TV show and looking that up, it's not as bad.
[00:04:19.350] 看看其他用户在看完电视节目后的想法，然后去搜索一下，其实也没那么糟糕。
[00:04:25.170] But it's when there's like a constant cycle of content pushing you to watch more things and then
[00:04:25.170] 但当内容不断循环往复，驱使你观看更多内容时，问题就出现了。
[00:04:30.470] that pushing you to watch more content. That's when it feels a little bit like, okay, should I be
[00:04:30.470] 这会促使你观看更多内容。这时你会感觉有点儿……好吧，我应该……
[00:04:35.030] spending this much time looking this up?
[00:04:35.030] 花这么多时间查这个？
[00:04:37.970] Yeah. And I wonder if part of it is I work from home. Back in the day, I say back in the day,
[00:04:37.970] 是啊。我在想，是不是因为我在家工作。想当年，我说想当年，
[00:04:43.210] like people used to work in the office where, you know, you'd watch like a show. Like I remember
[00:04:43.210] 就像以前人们在办公室工作时，会一边看电视一边工作一样。我记得
[00:04:48.010] when I was younger, we would watch Lost with some of our family friends. And then when they go to
[00:04:48.010] 我小时候，会和一些家人朋友一起看《迷失》。然后当他们去……
[00:04:52.530] work, they'd be like, it's like the water cooler talk. And you're like talking to your co-workers
[00:04:52.530] 工作时，他们会说，这就像在饮水机旁闲聊一样。你就像在和同事聊天。
[00:04:55.590] about it. And that's just like a conversation to talk about. But now we've kind of taken that away.
[00:04:55.590] 关于这件事。这本来可以成为一个可以讨论的话题。但现在我们却剥夺了这种讨论的机会。
[00:05:00.050] Not saying everyone works from home, but now you've kind of sped that process up. Now you can go online
[00:05:00.050] 我不是说所有人都居家办公，但现在你确实加快了这个过程。现在你可以上网了。
[00:05:04.630] and look it up to see what other people are saying. Or you can talk about it with your friends
[00:05:04.630] 你可以上网查查其他人怎么说。或者你也可以和朋友们聊聊。
[00:05:13.750] and it's easier to maybe find things that fit your specific niche or like your thoughts as well.
[00:05:13.750] 而且更容易找到符合你特定兴趣或与你想法相符的东西。
[00:05:21.410] Because it's like sometimes you go to work and you talk about something, you might not agree with
[00:05:21.410] 因为有时候你去上班，和别人谈论某件事，你可能不会同意对方的观点。
[00:05:24.970] that person. So it might not feel super satisfying or get rid of that itch in your head. But online,
[00:05:24.970] 那个人。所以它可能不会让你感到非常满足，或者消除你脑海中的那个疑虑。但是在网上，
[00:05:31.390] you can flip through like 40 different forum posts and find one. You're like, ah, yes, I'm so happy
[00:05:31.390] 你可能要翻阅大约 40 个不同的论坛帖子才能找到一个。你会想，啊，是的，我太高兴了。
[00:05:36.310] someone else thinks this too. So true. You like find your own little echo chamber in the corner of
[00:05:36.310] 原来还有人这么想。确实如此。你就像在角落里找到了自己的小回音室。
[00:05:43.130] the internet. Exactly. So it sounds like the three of us are maybe a little bit more online
[00:05:43.130] 互联网。没错。所以听起来我们三个可能都比较爱上网。
[00:05:50.130] than the average person. But what are some signs for you guys that you need to unplug?
[00:05:50.130] 比一般人更甚。那么，你们觉得需要暂时放下电子产品有哪些迹象呢？
[00:05:57.070] Yes, I think Crystal mentioned it before. It's kind of just maybe some of the aimless use of being
[00:05:57.070] 是的，我想Crystal之前提到过。这可能只是某种漫无目的的利用而已。
[00:06:03.310] online. So sometimes I'll just be on Reddit, clicking on the homepage and just looking for
[00:06:03.310] 在网上。所以有时候我会浏览Reddit，点击首页，然后搜索……
[00:06:07.770] something to kind of like, catch my attention. It's like, am I really trying to look for a specific
[00:06:07.770] 一些能吸引我注意力的东西。就好像，我真的在寻找某个特定的东西吗？
[00:06:14.550] thing? Or like, what's my purpose for being online? And sometimes it's just, I'm bored. And I just want
[00:06:14.550] 是做什么事呢？或者说，我上网的目的是什么？有时候只是因为无聊。我只想……
[00:06:20.070] something to do. Same thing with shows. So if I'm going online, it's like, okay, if I know
[00:06:20.070] 找点事做。看剧也是一样。所以如果我上网，就会想，好吧，如果我知道
[00:06:25.690] Arcanes just came out, then I can go watch that. But I can also just go on Netflix and just scroll
[00:06:25.690] 《奥术》刚出，我可以去看。不过我也可以直接打开 Netflix 随便看看。
[00:06:31.590] through like all the different things of okay, let me find something to watch just because I'm bored
[00:06:31.590] 就像各种各样的事情一样，好吧，让我找点东西看看，因为我无聊。
[00:06:36.590] and I have nothing better to do. In reality, maybe I do have something better to do. But my brain maybe
[00:06:36.590] 我无事可做。实际上，也许我确实有更好的事可做。但我的大脑可能……
[00:06:41.950] is just tied to trying to find something in technology. Dude, so true. I feel like there's
[00:06:41.950] 这只是跟在科技领域寻找某些东西有关。兄弟，说得太对了。我觉得有
[00:06:47.990] definitely been those muscle memory moments where like, I pull up my phone and my thumb just
[00:06:47.990] 肯定有过那种肌肉记忆式的时刻，比如，我拿出手机，拇指就……
[00:06:53.310] automatically leads me to like Reddit or like Instagram. And I'm like, wait, I literally just
[00:06:53.310] 它会自动把我引导到Reddit或Instagram之类的网站。然后我就想，等等，我刚才明明只是……
[00:06:58.510] open this app. Why am I opening it again? Yep, same. Yeah, so those are definitely more constant than I
[00:06:58.510] 打开这个应用。我为什么又要打开它？嗯，一样。是啊，所以这些肯定比我更频繁。
[00:07:05.910] would like to admit. These like muscle memory app openings. And sometimes it's almost muscle memory of
[00:07:05.910] 不得不承认，这些就像肌肉记忆一样，会自动打开应用程序。有时，这几乎完全是肌肉记忆。
[00:07:13.430] bringing your phone out of your pocket in itself. And then you're like, wait, why did I even need my
[00:07:13.430] 把手机从口袋里掏出来本身就是一件很奇怪的事。然后你会想，等等，我为什么要掏手机？
[00:07:18.070] phone again? And then you like take it out again three seconds after you put it back into your pocket.
[00:07:18.070] 又是手机？然后你刚把它放回口袋三秒钟后又拿出来。
[00:07:23.630] Okay, I feel like mine is a little bit. It's a lot. But usually I like a dual screen setup. And if I'm
[00:07:23.630] 好吧，我觉得我的屏幕有点大。其实挺大的。但我通常喜欢双屏设置。如果我是
[00:07:31.010] sitting at my computer, it means that I have my main monitor and I'm like doing something on it,
[00:07:31.010] 我坐在电脑前，意味着我正用我的主显示器做些事情。
[00:07:35.470] whether it's reading a forum or like playing a game or something. And then on my side screen,
[00:07:35.470] 不管是浏览论坛还是玩游戏什么的。然后，在我的侧屏上，
[00:07:39.750] I'll have like a show or music or like something else going to stimulate me. If I'm not on my screen,
[00:07:39.750] 我会看电视、听音乐或者做点其他事情来提神。如果我不看屏幕，
[00:07:45.710] I'll have my iPad running some sort of show and then I'll be like doing something on my phone,
[00:07:45.710] 我会用iPad播放一些节目，然后我会用手机做点别的事情。
[00:07:49.530] right? But I will say there are times where I need so much like technological stimulation that I bring
[00:07:49.530] 对吧？但我必须说，有时候我需要大量的科技刺激，所以我会带来
[00:07:56.790] out like the triple screen setup, where maybe I'll have something on the TV. And then I'm doing
[00:07:56.790] 就像三屏设置那样，我可能会在电视上看点什么。然后我就会……
[00:08:01.810] something on my computer or my iPad. And then that's not enough. So I'll like pull out my phone.
[00:08:01.810] 我电脑或iPad上有些东西。然后这还不够。所以我就会拿出手机。
[00:08:06.790] As soon as that happens, I'm like, okay, this, this is too much. Take a step back.
[00:08:06.790] 一旦这种情况发生，我就会想，好吧，这太过分了。得退一步。
[00:08:12.970] Wait, I have a question, though. When you do that, do you truly capture all three mediums,
[00:08:12.970] 等等，我有个问题。当你这样做的时候，你真的能同时捕捉到这三种媒介的特点吗？
[00:08:18.950] like you're able to fully capture all the content? Once the third one comes out, it's like too much.
[00:08:18.950] 就像你能完全捕捉到所有内容一样？第三部出来之后，就感觉太多了。
[00:08:26.010] Like the third one usually means I'm playing a game on my phone, reading something on my computer
[00:08:26.010] 第三个选项通常表示我正在手机上玩游戏，或者在电脑上看书。
[00:08:30.110] and then watching something on the TV. So then I'm doing everything poorly. Everything's running
[00:08:30.110] 然后我就看电视。所以，我什么都做不好。一切都乱套了。
[00:08:35.090] at like 15% efficiency. But the dual screen, I feel like it's pretty good. Maybe it's like 70%
[00:08:35.090] 效率大概只有15%。但双屏感觉还不错，可能达到70%左右。
[00:08:41.050] consumption of each thing. I see. That's fair. I know it's a lot. But I don't know, maybe this need
[00:08:41.050] 每样东西的消耗量。我明白了。这很合理。我知道这很多。但我不知道，也许这种需求
[00:08:50.150] of wanting more, even more than the high stimulation that I'm already getting. I mean, a lot of people
[00:08:50.150] 我想要更多，甚至超过我现在所获得的这种高度刺激。我的意思是，很多人都这样。
[00:08:55.970] call this brain rot or like a segment of brain rot, I think. And I can also feel this on TikTok
[00:08:55.970] 我觉得可以称之为脑腐，或者说是脑腐的某种表现。而且我在TikTok上也能感受到这种现象。
[00:09:01.070] sometimes. The running joke is that there's subway surfers on the bottom and then some sort of other
[00:09:01.070] 有时候。有个梗是，最下面一层是地铁跑酷，上面还有一些其他的东西。
[00:09:07.090] clip that you're watching on top. So yeah, I just feel like my attention span is getting more and
[00:09:07.090] 你正在观看的片段就在上面。所以，是的，我感觉我的注意力越来越难以集中了。
[00:09:13.390] more segmented down.
[00:09:13.390] 进一步细分。
[00:09:15.130] Yeah, I would agree. And I think attention span is a good thing to point out is because I remember
[00:09:15.130] 是的，我同意。我觉得注意力持续时间这一点值得一提，因为我记得很清楚。
[00:09:21.110] before like I could watch shows and get through kind of the slower parts without any issue. But
[00:09:21.110] 以前我可以看剧，也能毫无障碍地看完节奏比较慢的部分。
[00:09:26.390] sometimes now, when I'm watching a show, and there's a slow part, I'll just take out my phone
[00:09:26.390] 现在有时候我看剧的时候，如果遇到节奏比较慢的部分，我就会拿出手机。
[00:09:31.210] and just like start, I don't know, I'll go on Instagram or go on Reddit or something. And I'm
[00:09:31.210] 然后就随便吧，我也不知道，我会上Instagram或者Reddit之类的。然后我
[00:09:35.710] still paying attention to the show. But then I just get distracted. And then eventually it picks up.
[00:09:35.710] 我还在认真看节目，但很快就分心了。不过，节目最终还是精彩起来了。
[00:09:40.550] And then I have to go back in the show to catch up. But then it's like, I need to catch myself in
[00:09:40.550] 然后我得回去继续看节目，赶上进度。但那样的话，我就得赶紧调整好自己。
[00:09:44.870] those moments and just be like, this is part of the process. I need to just focus on the show.
[00:09:44.870] 那些时刻，我只能告诉自己，这是过程的一部分。我需要专注于演出。
[00:09:49.370] Because there's also a lot of times where I'll have a show on in the background that I actually care
[00:09:49.370] 因为很多时候我也会一边看电视一边听，而我其实很关心这个节目。
[00:09:53.630] about the plot. I just miss it. And I'm like, I have no clue what I just watched for 30 minutes,
[00:09:53.630] 剧情方面，我完全没看懂。我感觉自己好像完全不知道刚才看了30分钟什么。
[00:09:58.230] I need to go back and watch it because I didn't actually take the time to pay attention to that.
[00:09:58.230] 我得回去再看一遍，因为我当时没认真看。
[00:10:03.850] Just I'm trying to overstimulate myself probably, which probably just an attention span problem.
[00:10:03.850] 我可能只是想让自己过度兴奋，这可能只是注意力不集中的问题。
[00:10:09.930] I think it becomes more obvious for myself when I'm tired as well. If I'm trying to watch like a
[00:10:09.930] 我觉得当我疲惫的时候，这一点就更加明显了。如果我试图像……一样观看
[00:10:16.210] show or something, I'm pretty exhausted. And I pull out my phone suddenly to like, do other stuff.
[00:10:16.210] 演出什么的，我挺累的。然后我突然拿出手机，想做点别的事。
[00:10:22.710] I'll catch myself like, Oh, wait, what am I doing? Now I don't know what is going on on either of
[00:10:22.710] 我会突然意识到，哦，等等，我在干什么？现在我完全不知道两个屏幕上发生了什么。
[00:10:27.910] these screens. So then I have to like, pause, rewind, put the phone away. But then it's like
[00:10:27.910] 这些屏幕。所以我就得暂停、倒带、把手机收起来。但那样的话……
[00:10:33.270] such a habit that sometimes later into the show or whatever, I'll pull my phone out again. I'm like,
[00:10:33.270] 我已经养成了这样的习惯：有时候在节目播放到一半的时候，我还会不自觉地拿出手机。我会想，
[00:10:38.630] wait, I just went over this. Like I can't be doing this right now.
[00:10:38.630] 等等，我刚才才看过这个。我现在不能再做这个了。
[00:10:41.750] It truly is muscle memory. And I feel like a lot of it too, is not just our bad habits as a consumer,
[00:10:41.750] 这确实是肌肉记忆。而且我觉得，很多时候，这不仅仅是我们作为消费者的坏习惯造成的。
[00:10:49.730] but I feel like we're also being trained this way to a certain extent. Balmy, you mentioned
[00:10:49.730] 但我感觉我们在某种程度上也正在接受这种训练。巴尔米，你刚才提到过。
[00:10:54.510] Instagram. And I feel this very often with Instagram where I'll open it to see if there's
[00:10:54.510] Instagram。我经常有这种感觉，打开 Instagram 就是想看看有没有什么新内容。
[00:10:59.570] any unseen stories. Because I don't like seeing the ring around it. And then I'll just like tap
[00:10:59.570] 任何未曾讲述的故事。因为我不喜欢看到它周围的圆圈。然后我就会轻轻敲击。
[00:11:04.650] through everything really quick. And I'm just like, why am I even doing this? I feel like a monkey or
[00:11:04.650] 一切都进行得飞快。然后我就想，我到底为什么要这么做？我觉得自己像只猴子。
[00:11:08.670] something. Wait, do you watch every single story on your feed? If I'm not having like a super busy day,
[00:11:08.670] 什么事。等等，你是不是每条动态都看？如果我当天不是特别忙的话，
[00:11:15.650] I'll out of habit just like click through everything. And I'm not even like truly watching it.
[00:11:15.650] 我习惯性地就随便点开所有内容。我根本就没认真看。
[00:11:19.490] Yeah, just trying to get that ring out there. I do the same thing. I don't know if I feel better
[00:11:19.490] 是啊，就是想把那枚戒指寄出去。我也一样。我不知道这样感觉会不会更好。
[00:11:25.450] or worse that I do the same thing. Oh my god, I used to do that back in the day when stories was
[00:11:25.450] 更糟的是，我竟然也做了同样的事。我的天哪，以前玩Stories的时候，我经常这么做。
[00:11:33.280] still kind of new. And it felt like I could finish it. But now it feels like it's never ending.
[00:11:33.280] 感觉还挺新的。而且感觉我能完成它。但现在感觉它永远也完不成。
[00:11:38.400] Don't people add new stories almost immediately after you finish?
[00:11:38.400] 难道你写完之后，人们不会马上就添加新的故事吗？
[00:11:42.500] Yeah, I mean, maybe my following list is like a little bit more manageable where maybe the people
[00:11:42.500] 是的，我的意思是，也许我的关注列表更容易管理，因为人们
[00:11:48.060] I follow don't post as many stories. But yeah, if I have time, I will try to get through the pile of
[00:11:48.060] 我关注的人不多发故事。不过，如果我有时间，我会尽量把积压的故事都看完。
[00:11:55.260] stories. That's the 100% completionist in you. Well, besides some signs that you need to unplug,
[00:11:55.260] 故事。这就是你百分百完美主义的体现。嗯，除了某些迹象表明你需要放松一下之外，
[00:12:04.020] are there any things that help you unplug in the moment? Whether that means you're unplugging one
[00:12:04.020] 有没有什么方法能让你暂时放松下来？不管是拔掉一个插头还是其他什么。
[00:12:10.460] thing to focus on another plugged in thing. But I wonder if you have any measures that help you
[00:12:10.460] 把注意力转移到另一个电子设备上。但我想知道你有没有什么方法可以帮到你。
[00:12:16.940] stay, I guess, more focused on one thing at a time.
[00:12:16.940] 我想，最好一次只专注于一件事。
[00:12:20.640] So probably like we talked about before, just kind of being conscious of why I'm trying to do
[00:12:20.640] 所以可能就像我们之前讨论的那样，就是要清楚我为什么要这么做。
[00:12:27.760] what I'm doing. If I just like go on Reddit aimlessly, maybe that just means I should go for
[00:12:27.760] 我正在做什么。如果我只是漫无目的地浏览Reddit，也许这意味着我应该去……
[00:12:32.520] a walk or go like work out a little bit or go get some food or something, right? It gets some
[00:12:32.520] 散散步，或者稍微活动一下，或者去吃点东西什么的，对吧？这样可以得到一些好处。
[00:12:37.980] distraction because I've probably just been laying down and I'm just trying to find a distraction.
[00:12:37.980] 我可能是因为一直躺着，所以想找点事情分散注意力。
[00:12:43.840] Or it could be after work. So if I just had a really long workday, a lot of meetings,
[00:12:43.840] 或者也可能是在下班之后。比如，如果我那天工作时间很长，开了很多会，
[00:12:48.760] I've just been working from like nine to five straight. And my brain is kind of fried. Sometimes
[00:12:48.760] 我一直从早上九点工作到下午五点，现在脑子都快炸了。有时候
[00:12:54.180] I'll just go on to my other monitor, which has my personal computer, and then I'll start trying to
[00:12:54.180] 我这就切换到我的另一个显示器，上面有我的个人电脑，然后我再开始尝试……
[00:12:59.020] watch a show. But then it's like, is that really what I need right now? Or should I just kind of get a
[00:12:59.020] 看剧。但之后又会想，这真的是我现在需要的吗？还是我应该随便找个……
[00:13:03.700] break? And then go do something else, spend time with the family and get some food, etc.
[00:13:03.700] 休息一下？然后去做点别的事，比如陪陪家人，吃点东西等等。
[00:13:09.340] I think for me, there's probably a couple of things that I do. One, I have to transition out
[00:13:09.340] 我觉得对我来说，我可能会做两件事。第一，我必须过渡出去
[00:13:14.660] of a certain part of the internet and then into like a more real life part of the internet.
[00:13:14.660] 先是互联网的某个特定部分，然后进入互联网上更贴近现实生活的部分。
[00:13:19.640] And what I mean by that is instead of watching reality TV or reading Reddit, I'll open up like
[00:13:19.640] 我的意思是，与其看真人秀或刷Reddit，不如敞开心扉……
[00:13:25.120] a vlog or something. And I'll slowly transition into more of like the lifestyle part of YouTube.
[00:13:25.120] 比如做个vlog之类的。然后我会慢慢转型，更多地做YouTube上的生活方式类内容。
[00:13:31.380] And YouTube is also a little bit more long form than TikTok. Sometimes I feel like it does help.
[00:13:31.380] 而且YouTube的视频时长也比TikTok长一些。有时候我觉得这确实有帮助。
[00:13:36.380] But what really helps me honestly is like getting some fresh air. And I'm not someone who takes a lot
[00:13:36.380] 但说实话，真正对我有帮助的其实是呼吸一些新鲜空气。而且我不是那种需要呼吸很多空气的人。
[00:13:42.540] of walks. So I'm either like at home or I'm outside, you know, but even just stepping out into
[00:13:42.540] 散步。所以我要么在家，要么在外面，你知道，但即使只是走出去
[00:13:48.580] like the backyard really quick and getting like a huge whiff of fresh air, I feel like resets me a
[00:13:48.580] 就像在后院待一会儿，深深吸一口新鲜空气，感觉就像重新焕发了活力。
[00:13:54.020] little bit. I get less of a need to be chronically online. I think one thing that helps me is actually
[00:13:54.020] 稍微好了一些。我不再那么需要长时间上网了。我觉得对我有帮助的一件事是……
[00:14:01.560] the do not disturb functions on our phones. I have it automatically set to go off at night.
[00:14:01.560] 我们手机上的“勿扰模式”。我设置了晚上自动关闭。
[00:14:09.260] And I feel like that's a huge help because I don't know how we used to do it before.
[00:14:09.260] 我觉得这对我很有帮助，因为我不知道我们以前是怎么做的。
[00:14:15.660] I'm pretty sure every time my phone vibrated in the middle of the night in the past, it would wake
[00:14:15.660] 我几乎可以肯定，过去每次我的手机在半夜震动，都会把我吵醒。
[00:14:20.460] me up. There would be maybe like a 60 to 70% chance that it would wake me up. So now that I have
[00:14:20.460] 把我叫醒。大概有 60% 到 70% 的几率能把我叫醒。所以现在我有了
[00:14:26.680] do not disturb automatically set, I can like sleep through the night and not worry about notifications.
[00:14:26.680] 自动设置勿扰模式，我可以睡个好觉，不用担心通知。
[00:14:33.200] And I have it set to a little later in the morning to one because I wake up later, but also because
[00:14:33.200] 我把它设置成早上晚些时候，也就是一点，因为我起得比较晚，而且也因为
[00:14:39.940] I think it protects my morning a bit better to when I wake up and I have to like get ready,
[00:14:39.940] 我觉得这样能更好地保护我的早晨，让我起床后不用那么忙地准备出门。
[00:14:45.940] eat breakfast and stuff. It reduces my screen time a bit as I prepare for my day.
[00:14:45.940] 吃早餐什么的。这样可以减少我一天中看屏幕的时间。
[00:14:52.080] See, I feel like that wouldn't work on me because notifications aren't what makes me
[00:14:52.080] 你看，我觉得那对我没用，因为通知并不是让我变得重要的因素。
[00:14:57.780] chronically online. You know what I mean? It's like I just habitually open TikTok. I habitually
[00:14:57.780] 我经常上网。你懂我的意思吗？就像我习惯性地打开TikTok一样。我习惯性地
[00:15:02.580] open whatever phone game I'm playing at the moment. And then that's what takes up the majority of my
[00:15:02.580] 打开我当时正在玩的手机游戏。然后，我的大部分时间就花在游戏上了。
[00:15:07.480] screen time. So I feel like I need to come up with a way to block my phone games or something.
[00:15:07.480] 屏幕时间太长了。所以我感觉我需要想办法屏蔽手机游戏之类的东西。
[00:15:13.480] I think there's apps for that.
[00:15:13.480] 我觉得应该有相关的应用程序。
[00:15:15.320] Like limit your screen time or something.
[00:15:15.320] 比如限制屏幕使用时间之类的。
[00:15:17.400] Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:17.400] 是啊是啊。
[00:15:18.480] What is it? Parental control yourself.
[00:15:18.480] 这是什么？家长控制功能。
[00:15:20.440] Oh my God.
[00:15:20.440] 我的天啊。
[00:15:22.540] But yeah, I do think it helps in certain moments. I think like if I go out and I watch a movie in
[00:15:22.540] 不过，是的，我觉得在某些情况下确实有帮助。比如，如果我出去看电影……
[00:15:28.800] theaters, I'll put my phone on do not disturb. It actually helps too for driving. Usually if you
[00:15:28.800] 去电影院的话，我会把手机调成勿扰模式。开车的时候这样做也很有帮助。通常如果你
[00:15:35.360] your phone connects by Bluetooth automatically to your car, it'll like automatically go into driving
[00:15:35.360] 您的手机通过蓝牙自动连接到您的汽车，它会自动进入驾驶模式。
[00:15:40.640] mode. And I do think it helps with like reducing the urge to respond to a text or something while
[00:15:40.640] 模式。而且我确实认为它有助于减少回复短信或其他信息的冲动。
[00:15:47.960] you're driving. Yeah, that makes sense. Safety first. I will also say too, in the beginning of
[00:15:47.960] 你在开车。嗯，有道理。安全第一。我还要补充一点，在开头……
[00:15:56.360] this episode, we talked about how unplugging or being online can mean very different things
[00:15:56.360] 在这一集中，我们讨论了“断网”和“在线”这两个词的含义可能截然不同。
[00:16:02.300] depending on what you're doing on your screens. So I'm curious if you guys feel like there are
[00:16:02.300] 这取决于你在屏幕上做什么。所以我很好奇你们是否觉得有……
[00:16:08.060] things you do on a screen that are way more productive and you wouldn't consider it as being
[00:16:08.060] 你在屏幕上做的事情效率更高，但你却不会认为那是……
[00:16:13.440] chronically online and things you do that are really, really unproductive. Like you consider
[00:16:13.440] 长时间沉迷网络，做一些非常非常没有效率的事情。比如你认为
[00:16:18.260] it basically rotting online.
[00:16:18.260] 它基本上已经在网上腐烂了。
[00:16:20.020] So it probably just goes back to like having a purpose for things. I work from home. So I guess
[00:16:20.020] 所以，这可能还是归根结底，就是要有做事的目的。我在家工作。所以我想
[00:16:24.740] all of that is technically productive, but maybe other things. So if there's like a new climbing
[00:16:24.740] 从技术上讲，所有这些都是有益的，但或许还有其他方面。所以，如果出现像新的攀岩路线之类的东西。
[00:16:30.960] video or something that I want to watch and I want to get something out of it because they're like
[00:16:30.960] 视频或者其他什么东西，我想看，而且我想从中获得一些东西，因为它们就像……
[00:16:35.700] showing a technique or they've collabed with an Olympian. And so I want to watch the Olympian
[00:16:35.700] 展示某种技术，或者他们与奥运选手合作。所以我想看奥运选手。
[00:16:41.260] climb because watching someone who's that good is just really cool and very inspiring. So I feel like
[00:16:41.260] 攀岩是因为观看像他那样优秀的人攀岩真的很酷，也很鼓舞人心。所以我感觉
[00:16:46.060] that stuff is very good for me. I'm okay with it at least. Social media is a hard one because it's
[00:16:46.060] 那些东西对我很好。至少我能接受。社交媒体就比较难处理了，因为它……
[00:16:52.700] hard to ever really say like social media is really benefiting me, whether it's like my mental health
[00:16:52.700] 很难说社交媒体到底对我有什么好处，无论是对我的心理健康方面。
[00:16:58.960] or like good use of my time. But I guess there are still allowances for it that I give myself where
[00:16:58.960] 或者说，我觉得这样能更好地利用时间。但我猜我还是会给自己留一些余地，比如在某些时候。
[00:17:05.460] I want to see what other people are doing. Or sometimes I will find like a funny meme that I
[00:17:05.460] 我想看看别人在做什么。或者有时候我会看到一些有趣的表情包，然后……
[00:17:11.180] can send to my friends. Or again, it's just like tied to something that's my hobby or on Instagram,
[00:17:11.180] 我可以发给我的朋友。或者，它就像是和我的爱好或者Instagram上的内容联系在一起的。
[00:17:18.220] I look up a lot of food stuff. So it's like I want to make that or that'd be really nice to make or get
[00:17:18.220] 我经常上网查各种食物的相关信息。比如，我想做这个，或者做这个会很好吃，或者想买这个。
[00:17:23.060] recipes from there. So those could be a little bit more productive watching shows. I watch pretty much
[00:17:23.060] 那里的食谱。所以看节目可能会更有意义。我基本上都看……
[00:17:28.940] all my shows in some sort of online or streaming platform. If I want to watch that content, then
[00:17:28.940] 我所有的节目都在某种在线或流媒体平台上。如果我想看这些内容，那么
[00:17:34.180] that's kind of the only avenue that I have. So those ones I'd say are things that I'm okay with.
[00:17:34.180] 那几乎是我唯一的办法了。所以，我觉得这些我都能接受。
[00:17:39.340] It's really just when it gets to the aimless searching for entertainment.
[00:17:39.340] 真正的问题在于漫无目的地寻找娱乐。
[00:17:44.160] Yeah, I think that's fair. Honestly, I'd probably agree with a lot of that. My time online is not
[00:17:44.160] 是的，我觉得这很合理。说实话，我可能大部分都会同意。我的上网时间并非如此。
[00:17:49.600] always unproductive. Similar to what you said, Balmy, like having a purpose or like a goal
[00:17:49.600] 总是毫无成效。就像你说的，Balmy，就像没有目标或使命一样。
[00:17:55.880] makes spending your time feel more valuable, I guess, or intentional. Even if I'm playing games,
[00:17:55.880] 这让我觉得花时间更有价值，或者说更有意义。即使我是在玩游戏，
[00:18:04.760] I feel like I usually have a goal in mind, like, oh, I want to finish this or like improve in this.
[00:18:04.760] 我感觉我通常都会有一个目标，比如，哦，我想完成这件事，或者想在这方面有所提高。
[00:18:11.900] And I think that makes it feel productive. And this is kind of a silly one. But I play like all the New
[00:18:11.900] 我觉得这样会让人感觉很有成就感。这有点傻，但我玩得像所有新……
[00:18:19.020] York Times games at night. I feel like that is very productive. That is like word exercises.
[00:18:19.020] 晚上玩《纽约时报》游戏。我觉得这很有帮助。这就像是做单词练习一样。
[00:18:25.820] It's like an enrichment activity. Yeah, exactly. I'm like, this is definitely productive and in no way
[00:18:25.820] 这就像一项课外活动。没错，就是这样。我觉得这绝对是有益的，而且绝无任何弊端。
[00:18:33.360] wasting my time. See, that is so interesting to me because I feel like playing games feels really,
[00:18:33.360] 浪费我的时间。你看，这对我来说很有意思，因为我觉得玩游戏感觉真的很……
[00:18:41.220] really unproductive for me. Maybe it's the types of games that I choose to play or how I choose to
[00:18:41.220] 对我来说真的没什么效率。也许是因为我选择玩的游戏类型，或者是我选择的游戏方式。
[00:18:46.020] play it. Like I feel like social gaming and using games as a way to like connect with friends
[00:18:46.020] 玩吧。我感觉自己像是在玩社交游戏，把游戏当作一种和朋友联系的方式。
[00:18:52.480] is a more productive way. But for me, I'm like a big phone game person. I like to play very solitary
[00:18:52.480] 这是一种更高效的方式。但对我来说，我更喜欢玩手机游戏。我喜欢独自玩游戏。
[00:18:59.700] games like Stardew Valley or even stuff like TFT. I tend to play by myself and enjoy it more that way.
[00:18:59.700] 像《星露谷物语》或者《云顶之弈》之类的游戏，我通常一个人玩，这样更有乐趣。
[00:19:07.260] So sometimes when I'm stuck in that loop of playing games for a while, I'm like, this is pretty bad.
[00:19:07.260] 所以有时候当我长时间陷入玩游戏的循环中时，我就会想，这太糟糕了。
[00:19:13.300] This is not what I would consider productive consumption. Dude, but when you're playing games
[00:19:13.300] 这可不是我眼中的生产性消费。哥们儿，不过当你玩游戏的时候……
[00:19:18.340] like TFT, aren't you kind of setting a goal like, oh, I need to improve so I can like reach a certain
[00:19:18.340] 就像玩云顶之弈一样，你是不是也会设定一个目标，比如，哦，我需要提升自己，这样才能达到某个目标？
[00:19:23.860] level? Yeah, but it's like, what is that goal achieving? For me, I feel like there's no real life
[00:19:23.860] 达到某种境界？是啊，但问题是，这个目标到底能实现什么？对我来说，我觉得没有真正的生活。
[00:19:30.480] gain except for maybe like, I don't know, kudos that you can get for being like, I'm gold or I'm
[00:19:30.480] 除了可能获得的赞誉之外，没有其他收获，比如，我不知道，那种因为你觉得自己很棒或者很优秀而获得的赞誉。
[00:19:36.060] whatever in TFT. So then it just feels like something that I'm chasing. The opportunity cost
[00:19:36.060] 在云顶之弈里，什么都无所谓。所以感觉就像我一直在追逐某种东西。机会成本
[00:19:42.640] of the stuff that I'm not doing outweighs the gain that I'm about to get. So that's how I feel like
[00:19:42.640] 我没做的事情所带来的损失超过了我即将获得的收益。这就是我的感受。
[00:19:48.420] it's unproductive. And maybe because also I'm not like a huge, this is the strategy that I'm going
[00:19:48.420] 这效率太低了。也许也因为我不是那种特别热衷于此的人，所以我才采取这种策略。
[00:19:53.560] to try and see if this works. I'm kind of like, okay, let's brute force like 40 games and see where
[00:19:53.560] 试试看这方法行不行。我的想法是，好吧，那就暴力破解大概 40 场游戏，看看结果如何。
[00:19:58.520] that gets us kind of a person. So in that sense too, it's also unproductive, right? Like I'm not
[00:19:58.520] 这会让我们变成某种人。所以从这个意义上讲，这也是无益的，对吧？就像我不是
[00:20:03.820] necessarily honing my skills to an extent. I'm just kind of like brute forcing a bunch of different
[00:20:03.820] 一定程度上来说，我并没有磨练自己的技能。我只是有点像是在用蛮力硬闯各种不同的东西。
[00:20:07.740] things that exist on the internet. That's fair. It's like there's always something that people
[00:20:07.740] 互联网上存在的东西。这很合理。就好像总有一些东西是人们……
[00:20:13.800] call unproductive. So now it's gaming as gaming's become a lot more popular. But before you could
[00:20:13.800] 称之为无益。所以现在变成了游戏，因为游戏变得越来越流行。但在此之前，你可以
[00:20:19.460] say like watching TV is just the original brain rot or just doing hobbies, right? Your hobbies don't
[00:20:19.460] 比如说，看电视就是大脑衰退的根源，或者做些爱好也一样，对吧？你的爱好可不是这样。
[00:20:27.120] necessarily add value to your life in other people's perspectives. But to you, it's really
[00:20:27.120] 在别人看来，这未必能为你的生活增添价值。但对你而言，这确实如此。
[00:20:31.900] important because something that brings you joy, or it's something that keeps you healthy, or it's
[00:20:31.900] 重要，因为它能给你带来快乐，或者让你保持健康，或者它是……
[00:20:35.920] just something that like takes your mind away from the stresses of the world. So for me, that's kind
[00:20:35.920] 就是那种能让你暂时忘却世间压力的事情。对我来说，这挺好的。
[00:20:42.140] of where gaming fits in. It's just another kind of like art consumption. It's like a multiplayer game,
[00:20:42.140] 游戏在其中扮演着怎样的角色？它只不过是另一种艺术消费方式。它就像一款多人游戏。
[00:20:46.720] then it can be a way for me to like play with friends. So like if Crystal says, hey, you guys want
[00:20:46.720] 这样我就可以和朋友们一起玩了。比如，如果Crystal说：“嘿，你们想……”
[00:20:50.300] to play Valorant, and then I join, that's some time that I'm willing to spend because I don't talk to
[00:20:50.300] 玩《Valorant》，然后我加入，我愿意花些时间，因为我不跟别人说话。
[00:20:55.540] Crystal too much. But then we can like play a game and hang out virtually. Or if I'm playing a single
[00:20:55.540] 水晶太多了。不过我们可以一起玩游戏，在线上聚聚。或者如果我玩单人模式的话。
[00:21:00.480] player game, then it'll be something that I want to kind of experience whatever that art is that the
[00:21:00.480] 如果是玩家游戏，那它就会成为我想体验的那种艺术形式。
[00:21:07.940] creator created. And I want to enjoy that. So for me, it's similar to watching a movie or watching like
[00:21:07.940] 创作者创造了它。我想享受它。所以对我来说，这就像看电影或看其他东西一样。
[00:21:13.320] a TV show.
[00:21:13.320] 一档电视节目。
[00:21:14.420] Yeah, and I feel like this just goes to show how personal and subjective these feelings are, for sure.
[00:21:14.420] 是的，我觉得这正好说明了这些感受是多么个人化和主观。
[00:21:20.740] I kind of am in the realm where I consider online shopping very productive, where I'm like, okay,
[00:21:20.740] 我现在觉得网上购物非常高效，就像是，好吧，
[00:21:26.180] I'm doing research in order to get this product, because I'm doing it online. I have all these
[00:21:26.180] 我正在做功课，想买这个产品，因为我是在网上买的。我都有这些资料。
[00:21:30.980] different options and all these different forms of research that I could do. So to me, it feels like
[00:21:30.980] 不同的选择，以及我可以进行的各种不同的研究方法。所以对我来说，感觉就像是……
[00:21:35.340] a research project in a sense. But a lot of people could consider that like a big waste of time,
[00:21:35.340] 从某种意义上说，这是一个研究项目。但很多人可能会认为这是在浪费时间。
[00:21:41.680] right? It's like you're just spending money, and then you're spending hours on top of spending money
[00:21:41.680] 对吧？感觉就像你不仅在花钱，而且还要花好几个小时来花钱。
[00:21:46.160] trying to like find what you want. So it truly is a very personal experience, I think.
[00:21:46.160] 就像努力寻找自己想要的东西一样。所以我觉得，这真的是一种非常个人化的体验。
[00:21:50.900] So is your thesis what you end up buying?
[00:21:50.900] 所以你的理论和你最终购买的东西是一致的吗？
[00:21:53.240] Yeah, my thesis is like the sneakers that I want for fall. And then I'll spend like hours
[00:21:53.240] 是啊，我的论文就像我秋季想要的那双运动鞋。然后我会花上好几个小时。
[00:21:59.740] researching on like, what's going to go out of style. And by the time I choose to buy the sneakers,
[00:21:59.740] 我会研究一下哪些东西会过时。等我决定买那双运动鞋的时候，
[00:22:05.060] everything is already out of style. So it doesn't even really fucking matter.
[00:22:05.060] 所有东西都已经过时了，所以根本就无关紧要。
[00:22:09.860] But I can totally see how that feels and can be productive as well. Because it kind of all goes
[00:22:09.860] 但我完全能理解那种感受，而且这也可能很有成效。因为这一切最终都会过去。
[00:22:17.540] back to what Balmeet said, where like, you have a purpose, you're like, I'm literally doing research
[00:22:17.540] 回到巴尔米特刚才说的，就是你有目标，你会想，我这是在做研究呢。
[00:22:23.240] what to buy. There's intent, and you're gaining a lot of information. I guess in a sense, it's yeah,
[00:22:23.240] 买什么？这里面有购买意图，而且你也能获得很多信息。我想从某种意义上说，是的。
[00:22:30.160] like you said, it's a research project, you're doing reading, gaining knowledge and all of that.
[00:22:30.160] 正如你所说，这是一个研究项目，你在阅读、获取知识等等。
[00:22:34.880] And honestly, it's kind of a skill to have to I think internet literacy is a skill at the end of
[00:22:34.880] 说实话，我认为掌握互联网素养最终是一种技能。
[00:22:40.840] the day. But I guess it's like how we choose to use it. If what we're doing brings value to our lives
[00:22:40.840] 一天。但我想，关键在于我们如何选择利用它。如果我们所做的事情能为我们的生活带来价值。
[00:22:47.380] in its own way, or if we just end up on the couch scrolling TikTok. Okay, for me, scrolling TikTok
[00:22:47.380] 不管怎样，或者我们最后只是窝在沙发上刷TikTok。好吧，对我来说，就是刷TikTok。
[00:22:53.400] is extremely unproductive. But sometimes I just can't stop.
[00:22:53.400] 这样做效率极低。但有时候我就是停不下来。
[00:22:58.280] Well, okay, as a TikTok mega user or power user, whatever the phrase is, I have to say that there's
[00:22:58.280] 好吧，作为一名TikTok超级用户或者高级用户（不管用什么词来形容），我必须说，TikTok确实存在一些问题。
[00:23:07.160] so many different niches and sections in TikTok. So sometimes when I'm on like gift guide TikTok of
[00:23:07.160] TikTok 上有太多不同的细分领域和版块。所以有时候当我浏览像礼物指南 TikTok 这样的内容时……
[00:23:12.980] like things you should get your friends for the holidays, I feel like that's kind of productive.
[00:23:12.980] 比如，你应该送朋友哪些节日礼物，我觉得这挺有意义的。
[00:23:18.500] Yes, a lot of it is probably like hidden ads, but it's like I needed to do this research anyway.
[00:23:18.500] 是的，其中很多内容可能就像隐藏的广告，但感觉我无论如何都需要做这项研究。
[00:23:24.160] So I'm like, okay, this is like good to know. And I'll like bookmark it or like cooking talk,
[00:23:24.160] 所以我就想，好吧，这很有用。我会把它收藏起来，或者像烹饪话题之类的。
[00:23:28.220] I feel like is productive, or even like restaurant recommendation talk. So I feel like even within
[00:23:28.220] 我觉得这很有意义，或者就像聊餐厅推荐一样。所以我觉得即使在……
[00:23:34.160] TikTok, there's like Yelp TikTok, and there's like YouTube TikTok. And so you know, depends on where
[00:23:34.160] TikTok有Yelp TikTok，还有YouTube TikTok。所以，你知道，这取决于在哪里。
[00:23:40.420] your niche is. That's true. I tend to pick up TikTok when I need a good laugh or have nothing
[00:23:40.420] 你的专长就是这个。没错。我闲着没事干或者想找点乐子的时候，就会打开TikTok。
[00:23:47.260] else really going on. But you're right, there are some times where I stumble upon a video,
[00:23:47.260] 还有其他事情要忙。但你说得对，有时候我的确会偶然发现一些视频。
[00:23:51.300] and I'm like, Oh, this was actually very informational. Save.
[00:23:51.300] 我心想，哦，这其实挺有用的。保存。
[00:23:57.400] I don't have TikTok. It's just something that I've decided to never download. But with that being said,
[00:23:57.400] 我没有TikTok。我决定永远不下载它。话虽如此，
[00:24:04.160] Instagram and YouTube just kind of fills the void with Instagram reels and YouTube shorts. So
[00:24:04.160] Instagram 和 YouTube 正好填补了这一空白，Instagram 短视频和 YouTube 短片分别代表了 Instagram Reels 和 YouTube Shorts 的内容。
[00:24:08.520] I do the same thing. And sometimes you just get sucked into the algorithm. And it's like the
[00:24:08.520] 我也一样。有时候你会不由自主地被算法裹挟。就像……
[00:24:13.680] algorithm wins. And just keep going. But sometimes yeah, you find the little wins in there, like
[00:24:13.680] 算法赢了。继续前进。但有时候，你确实会发现一些小小的胜利，比如
[00:24:19.560] something to send to. For me, sometimes the win is if I send someone something. It's like I found value
[00:24:19.560] 寄点东西。对我来说，有时候赢就是寄点东西给别人。感觉就像我找到了价值。
[00:24:26.040] in it because this was worth me sending versus I just looked through 50 reels and nothing was worth
[00:24:26.040] 我之所以选择寄出这卷胶卷，是因为它值得我寄出去，而我之前翻阅了50卷胶卷，却没有一卷值得寄出去。
[00:24:32.240] sending. So it's like, did I get anything out of it? Which even if I send someone something,
[00:24:32.240] 发送。所以问题就变成了，我从中得到了什么吗？即使我给别人发送了东西，
[00:24:36.340] did I really get anything out of it? I don't know. But it's like the little wins, I guess.
[00:24:36.340] 我真的从中得到了什么吗？我不知道。但我想，这就像是小小的胜利吧。
[00:24:41.100] Yeah, that's true. Some comments on TikTok that make me laugh. They're just like, I have no one to
[00:24:41.100] 是啊，没错。TikTok上有些评论真的让我笑出声。他们就说，我没有可以倾诉的人。
[00:24:46.480] talk about this with. Oh, yeah. It's because like something is just so niche or like specific.
[00:24:46.480] 跟别人聊聊这个。哦，对。因为有些东西太小众或者太特殊了。
[00:24:52.520] They can only bond with the other fellow commenters. They're like none of my friends would
[00:24:52.520] 他们只能和其他评论者交流。他们跟我朋友里任何人都不一样。
[00:24:57.680] understand. Whenever I come across those, I'm like, fuck.
[00:24:57.680] 我明白了。每次看到那些东西，我都会想，真他妈的。
[00:25:01.420] I'm like my people.
[00:25:01.420] 我和我的族人一样。
[00:25:04.640] I have a question and it's maybe slightly veering away from the unplugged topic. But do you ever feel
[00:25:04.640] 我有个问题，可能稍微偏离了“断网”这个话题。但你有没有过这种感觉？
[00:25:09.700] like your social media algorithm? So in this case, it could be TikTok or it could be like Instagram
[00:25:09.700] 就像你的社交媒体算法一样？所以，在这种情况下，它可能是TikTok，也可能是Instagram。
[00:25:15.900] reels where it's kind of veering towards maybe an algorithm that you don't necessarily want to go
[00:25:15.900] 卷轴似乎正在向某种你未必想看到的算法靠拢。
[00:25:21.100] down that route. And then you try and manipulate it to bring it back to what your interests are,
[00:25:21.100] 沿着这条路走下去。然后你试图操纵它，让它重新符合你的利益。
[00:25:25.640] kind of what your purpose for your social media algorithm is.
[00:25:25.640] 这大概就是你社交媒体算法的目的所在。
[00:25:30.360] Yeah, honestly, this is very brainwad of me. But I think of my TikTok algorithm as like a child.
[00:25:30.360] 说实话，这确实是我一厢情愿的想法。但我把TikTok的算法比作一个孩子。
[00:25:36.820] Oh, my God.
[00:25:36.820] 我的天啊。
[00:25:37.820] And I have to like, set it straight sometimes.
[00:25:37.820] 有时候我不得不把事情说清楚。
[00:25:43.440] And I'll do so by rewarding good content. Like if it's a video that I'm like, oh, yeah,
[00:25:43.440] 我会通过奖励优质内容来实现这一点。比如，如果一个视频让我觉得，哦，是的，
[00:25:49.160] I'm glad this is all my algorithm. I'll like watch it through. I'll like read the comments or
[00:25:49.160] 我很高兴这一切都是我的算法。我会继续看下去。我也会看看评论。
[00:25:52.600] whatever. And if it's a video that I know is going to be bad in the first like three seconds of
[00:25:52.600] 随便吧。如果一个视频，我一开始就知道它肯定很糟糕，哪怕只有三秒钟。
[00:25:57.180] watching it, I'll like quickly skip it. And then that seems to kind of help it. Sometimes when I do
[00:25:57.180] 看的时候，我会快速跳过。这样似乎有点帮助。有时候我这样做
[00:26:01.440] that, I'm like, bro, this is like literally some lines of code. Like I shouldn't be personalizing
[00:26:01.440] 我当时就想，兄弟，这不就是几行代码吗？我不应该搞个性化设置啊。
[00:26:06.460] it and thinking of it as a child.
[00:26:06.460] 把它当作孩子看待。
[00:26:09.800] Boy, that's so funny.
[00:26:09.800] 哈哈，太搞笑了。
[00:26:12.620] That's why I was asking. Sometimes it just veers in a direction where it's like, I don't want to go
[00:26:12.620] 这就是我问的原因。有时候事情会朝着某个方向发展，让人觉得，我不想去。
[00:26:16.760] this route. Or it's like, it doesn't serve my purpose anymore. After coming back from Korea,
[00:26:16.760] 这条路。或者说，它对我来说已经没有意义了。从韩国回来之后，
[00:26:21.660] like I was flooded with Korea content. And some of it has stuck around. So like,
[00:26:21.660] 感觉我被韩国相关的内容淹没了。而且有些内容还一直保留了下来。所以，就像……
[00:26:26.180] there's like some K-pop stuff that would never showed up in my algorithm that now has like stuck
[00:26:26.180] 有些K-pop歌曲以前根本不会出现在我的算法推荐里，现在却一直都在。
[00:26:30.040] around a little bit or like food recommendations in Korea, which is great. But I'm not going to
[00:26:30.040] 稍微了解一下韩国的情况，或者推荐一些韩国美食，这很棒。但我不会……
[00:26:34.520] Korea again for a long time. So I don't need those. I want food recommendations for like LA.
[00:26:34.520] 我很久没去韩国了，所以不需要那些。我想找一些洛杉矶之类的餐厅推荐。
[00:26:39.420] Right, right. I think there's definitely been moments where I'm like, okay, what the hell is this
[00:26:39.420] 对，对。我觉得肯定有那么几个时刻，我会想，好吧，这到底是什么鬼东西。
[00:26:43.820] for you, Paige? What's going on here? Or like seeing the exact same stuff over and over
[00:26:43.820] 佩吉，你这是怎么了？这是怎么回事？还是说你总是看到同样的东西？
[00:26:49.160] gets like really tiring. Like I always get ads for collagen on my phone. And I'm like, dude,
[00:26:49.160] 真的太烦人了。我的手机上总是弹出胶原蛋白的广告。我就想，拜托，
[00:26:54.500] I already take collagen. I already bought collagen. Give me some new stuff. But I guess what's kind
[00:26:54.500] 我已经服用胶原蛋白了，也买过胶原蛋白了。给我推荐点新东西吧。不过我想，这算什么呢？
[00:27:00.020] of interesting is sometimes if I feel like the algorithm isn't serving my purpose anymore,
[00:27:00.020] 有趣的是，有时候我觉得算法已经无法满足我的需求了。
[00:27:04.960] I just like stop. So there's definitely moments in time where I don't touch TikTok for,
[00:27:04.960] 我就是喜欢停下来。所以肯定会有一些时候，我完全不会碰TikTok。
[00:27:11.360] I don't know, weeks or so because I'm just like, yeah, whatever. My for you page sucks right now
[00:27:11.360] 我不知道，大概几周吧，因为我感觉，算了，无所谓了。我的“为你推荐”页面现在糟透了。
[00:27:15.860] anyways. And I guess in my mind, I'm thinking maybe it'll reset itself sort of because I actually
[00:27:15.860] 总之。而且我猜，我心里想着，也许它会自行重置，因为我实际上
[00:27:22.100] don't ever like videos. I only like maybe watch them through and read comments, occasionally save
[00:27:22.100] 我从来不给视频点赞。我可能只会完整地看一遍，看看评论，偶尔会保存一下。
[00:27:29.480] stuff. Even if I accidentally like a video, I always unlike it. This is kind of an interesting
[00:27:29.480] 事情就是这样。即使我不小心点赞了一个视频，我也会取消点赞。这有点意思。
[00:27:34.320] question too, because James and I are both TikTok users, but we have very different algorithms.
[00:27:34.320] 这个问题也存在，因为我和 James 都是 TikTok 用户，但我们使用的算法却非常不同。
[00:27:40.340] So I will say like James has a lot of tech product content on his TikTok and then also like a lot of
[00:27:40.340] 所以我想说，James 的 TikTok 账号上有很多科技产品相关的内容，还有很多其他类型的内容。
[00:27:46.440] sports highlights. And then for me, I have a lot of like humor stuff and then bits and pieces of each
[00:27:46.440] 体育集锦。然后对我来说，我有很多搞笑的东西，还有一些零零碎碎的片段。
[00:27:52.140] of my hobbies like K-pop, reality TV, shopping, whatever. But for the most part, it's like funny
[00:27:52.140] 我的爱好包括韩流、真人秀、购物等等。但大多数时候，这都挺搞笑的。
[00:27:57.580] content. So when we do our TikTok review at the end of the night, we always use my phone because mine has
[00:27:57.580] 内容。所以，当我们在晚上结束的时候做TikTok点评，我们总是用我的手机，因为我的手机有
[00:28:03.840] all the funnies, right? But sometimes I will have consumed too much gift guide content or whatever,
[00:28:03.840] 都是些搞笑的东西，对吧？但有时候我也会看太多礼物指南之类的东西，
[00:28:09.560] or like shopping or like restaurant. And that will supersede the funnies. And then he'll be like,
[00:28:09.560] 或者像购物或者去餐厅吃饭。这些都会比笑话更重要。然后他就会说，
[00:28:15.900] Ooh, you're like, what's wrong with your algorithm today? And I feel like I'm getting like my test
[00:28:15.900] 哦，你是不是在想，今天的算法怎么出问题了？我觉得我好像要考试了。
[00:28:20.600] graded or something, or like someone's reading my journal. And I'm like, Oh, like, sorry. I don't
[00:28:20.600] 好像有人在给我的日记评分似的，或者像是有人在看我的日记。然后我就想，哦，不好意思。我没有。
[00:28:24.880] know why it's like this. Like, it should be more funny today. Like, I'm so sorry. Then later,
[00:28:24.880] 我知道为什么会这样。本来今天应该更有趣才对。我很抱歉。然后后来，
[00:28:29.000] I'm just like, wait, wait, you should next time you should be like, wait, how about you pull out your
[00:28:29.000] 我当时就想，等等，等等，下次你应该说，等等，不如你把……
[00:28:34.660] TikTok algorithm? Well, sometimes we do. And then I'm like, I can't watch 20 NBA highlights videos in
[00:28:34.660] TikTok算法？嗯，有时候确实如此。然后我就想，我不可能一口气看完20个NBA集锦视频。
[00:28:41.640] a row. Yeah. You'd be like, Oh, what's wrong with your algorithm today? Wait, that's so funny. You do
[00:28:41.640] 一行。是啊。你会想，哦，你们的算法今天又出什么问题了？等等，这太搞笑了。你确实
[00:28:47.980] a TikTok review at the end of the day. Yeah. You know, actually, speaking of all this, going back to
[00:28:47.980] 最后再来个TikTok测评。是啊。你知道，说起来，回到……
[00:28:55.000] what Balmite said, finding something that is sendable to a friend is very satisfying. And I was thinking
[00:28:55.000] 正如巴尔米特所说，找到可以发给朋友的东西真的很有成就感。我当时就在想……
[00:29:01.900] about it as we've been talking about this all, the more I think about it, the more true it is.
[00:29:01.900] 在我们讨论这件事的过程中，我越想越觉得这是真的。
[00:29:07.200] I think every time I bump into something where I'm like, Oh my God, someone could relate with me over
[00:29:07.200] 我觉得每次遇到一些事，让我感觉“天哪，肯定有人能理解我的感受”的时候，我都会想：
[00:29:11.880] this. It's a huge win. I'm like, nice. I'm normal. This is relatable content. I also think that the
[00:29:11.880] 就是这样。这简直太棒了。我感觉，真好。我很正常。这内容很有共鸣。我还认为
[00:29:20.660] process of finding something sendable is also very different per person. And I realized this through
[00:29:20.660] 每个人寻找可发送内容的过程也大相径庭。我通过以下方式意识到了这一点：
[00:29:26.960] the many years of me and James sending each other content. If I see something that's 1% relevant to
[00:29:26.960] 我和詹姆斯多年来一直互相发送内容。如果我看到一些哪怕只有1%相关的东西……
[00:29:32.600] James, I'll send it to him. And I'm like, haha, like this reminded me of you. But then I realized that
[00:29:32.600] 詹姆斯，我会把它发给他。然后我就想，哈哈，这让我想起了你。但后来我意识到……
[00:29:38.040] he doesn't do that with me. Like he kind of like curates it way more. It's like, Oh, well, Jisoo
[00:29:38.040] 他不会那样对我。他好像会更精心策划。就好像，哦，好吧，智秀。
[00:29:43.660] laugh at this. And I feel like that's his criteria. And it completely changed the way that I see content
[00:29:43.660] 嘲笑这个。我觉得这就是他的评判标准。这彻底改变了我看待内容的方式。
[00:29:49.140] too. I'm like, maybe I shouldn't just be like, Oh, this reminded me of you and send it like maybe I
[00:29:49.140] 我也是。我就想，也许我不应该只是说，“哦，这让我想起了你”，然后就发过去，好像我
[00:29:53.460] should be like this TikTok is perfectly created for you and send that instead. Like have a higher
[00:29:53.460] 应该像这样，这个TikTok账号简直就是为你量身打造的，然后发这个账号。比如，拥有更高的……
[00:29:58.660] like barrier of entry, I guess. Dude, I'm definitely on the towards James's thought process.
[00:29:58.660] 就像准入门槛一样，我猜。兄弟，我绝对赞同詹姆斯的想法。
[00:30:04.820] Whenever I share stuff, sometimes I'll share stuff with like Balmy and the other guys that we play
[00:30:04.820] 我分享东西的时候，有时候会和巴尔米以及其他我们一起玩的人分享。
[00:30:10.380] games with. And it'll be like very specific Valorant content or like something that we do together.
[00:30:10.380] 一起玩游戏。而且会是一些非常具体的Valorant内容，或者我们一起做的事情。
[00:30:16.780] And then yeah, for you, it's also similar. Like, will Jisoo laugh at this? Or like, did we talk about
[00:30:16.780] 对，对你来说也差不多。比如，Jisoo会笑吗？或者，我们之前聊过这个吗？
[00:30:22.200] this recently? Like that kind of stuff. I also think it depends on who the person is,
[00:30:22.200] 最近发生过这种事吗？比如这类事。我觉得这也取决于对方是谁。
[00:30:26.900] because I'm also on that more curated side. But like certain people, I might just be like,
[00:30:26.900] 因为我也是比较注重细节的那一类人。但就像某些人一样，我可能也会想，
[00:30:32.180] Oh, will they judge me for sending them this? Because it didn't hit like the bar of what
[00:30:32.180] 哦，他们会因为我发这个而评判我吗？因为它没达到预期效果。
[00:30:37.040] ascendable like real is or meme is. So there's also that it's just the acceptance of the person.
[00:30:37.040] 就像现实或网络迷因一样，它也是可以提升的。所以，这其中也包含着对这个人的接受程度。
[00:30:43.860] Will they like judge me for sending them low quality content?
[00:30:43.860] 他们会因为我发送低质量内容而评判我吗？
[00:30:48.360] Also, I think it's fair to send someone like your significant other, just like way more content,
[00:30:48.360] 另外，我觉得给像另一半这样的人发些内容也挺合理的，毕竟他们喜欢的内容要多得多。
[00:30:54.900] because they probably are on a different level of understanding with you than just any other
[00:30:54.900] 因为他们与你的理解水平可能与其他任何人不同。
[00:31:01.320] random friend. So then sometimes when I'm thinking about, you know, specific friends to send stuff to,
[00:31:01.320] 随机朋友。所以有时候，当我想到要给哪些特定的朋友发送东西时，
[00:31:07.200] this can't have been a waste of their time. They can't just open it and be like, I don't get it.
[00:31:07.200] 这不可能是浪费他们的时间。他们不可能打开之后就说，我看不懂。
[00:31:12.780] But like, if I sent something really random to my boyfriend, and he was like, I don't get it. It's
[00:31:12.780] 但比如说，如果我给我男朋友发一些很莫名其妙的东西，他却说，我看不懂。
[00:31:17.820] like, fine, I can explain it to him. Or I can be like, what the fuck? And then judge him for it in a
[00:31:17.820] 好吧，我可以跟他解释。或者我可以一脸懵逼，然后评判他。
[00:31:23.520] judge free zone.
[00:31:23.520] 无评判区。
[00:31:25.880] Yeah, that's very true. Although I will say sometimes we'll have our TikTok review sessions.
[00:31:25.880] 是的，确实如此。不过我得说，有时候我们也会进行TikTok视频点评。
[00:31:32.120] You know, when you're scrolling TikTok by yourself, or at least for me, I feel like I'm more likely to
[00:31:32.120] 你知道，当你一个人刷TikTok的时候，或者至少对我来说，我觉得我更有可能……
[00:31:36.560] watch a video that's longer. So like, even if it's like a five minute video on TikTok, which typically only
[00:31:36.560] 看个长点的视频。比如，哪怕是TikTok上那种五分钟的视频，虽然通常只有五分钟。
[00:31:41.800] has like, I don't know, one to two minute long videos, also watch it because I'm just by myself,
[00:31:41.800] 里面有一些时长大概一到两分钟的视频，我一个人看也是因为这个原因。
[00:31:46.540] right? I feel like when you're watching as a pair, it's like so strange to go from like little snippet
[00:31:46.540] 对吧？我觉得两个人一起看的时候，从一小段片段直接跳到完整版，感觉很奇怪。
[00:31:52.800] videos and then watching like a full on like five minute video. So sometimes we'll skip those even
[00:31:52.800] 视频，然后看完一个完整的五分钟视频。所以有时候我们会跳过这些视频。
[00:31:58.620] though we like sent it to each other and be like, okay, whoever didn't watch it, just watch it on
[00:31:58.620] 虽然我们喜欢互相转发，然后说，好吧，没看过的人，就自己去看吧。
[00:32:02.300] your own time. And when that happens, I'm like, dude, this is such a strange experience. You know,
[00:32:02.300] 你得自己安排时间。当这种情况发生时，我就会想，老兄，这真是太奇怪的体验了。你知道，
[00:32:08.080] I feel like families and couples went from watching TV shows or like movies together. And then now I
[00:32:08.080] 我觉得以前家人和情侣会一起看电视节目或电影，而现在我……
[00:32:14.500] just my attention span is like, this is five minutes long. Like I can't watch it right now.
[00:32:14.500] 我的注意力持续时间很短，这段视频才五分钟，我现在根本看不下去。
[00:32:18.620] Oh my god.
[00:32:18.620] 我的天啊。
[00:32:19.780] Wow, it's like homework. You're like, watch this on your own time.
[00:32:19.780] 哇，这简直像做作业一样。你会想，自己找时间看吧。
[00:32:23.060] Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:23.060] 是啊是啊。
[00:32:23.960] We'll come back to discuss.
[00:32:23.960] 我们稍后再讨论。
[00:32:26.420] From book club to TikTok club.
[00:32:26.420] 从读书俱乐部到抖音俱乐部。
[00:32:29.000] Yeah.
[00:32:29.000] 是的。
[00:32:29.240] So it seems that in our conversation of unplugging, we've accidentally plugged ourselves in.
[00:32:29.240] 所以看来，在我们讨论如何“断网”的时候，我们反而不小心把自己“插上了网”。
[00:32:36.980] Just a little bit.
[00:32:36.980] 就一点点。
[00:32:38.300] What is like the hardest part of unplugging to bring us back?
[00:32:38.300] 断开网络连接、回归现实最难的是什么？
[00:32:42.740] So I actually feel like the hardest part of unplugging is really just missing that stimulation
[00:32:42.740] 所以我觉得，真正难熬的戒断期其实是失去那种刺激感。
[00:32:48.440] aspect. And if it's like a weekend where I have a lot of social plans, I feel like I don't have an
[00:32:48.440] 方面。如果像周末那样，我有很多社交活动，我就感觉自己没有……
[00:32:56.760] urge to like really be plugged in because I'm like, oh my god, it's so much fun. I'm like chatting
[00:32:56.760] 我特别想完全沉浸其中，因为我觉得，天哪，这太有趣了。我就像在聊天一样。
[00:33:00.680] with all my friends. We might be out doing stuff or just, you know, enjoying some time together.
[00:33:00.680] 和我的朋友们一起。我们可能会出去玩，或者只是，你知道的，一起享受时光。
[00:33:05.600] I don't even get the urge. But if it's a weekend where I'm like by myself for the entire weekend,
[00:33:05.600] 我完全没有那种冲动。但如果周末我整个周末都一个人待着，
[00:33:11.880] don't have any social plans, I like need all my screens. And I've tried to I've been trying to
[00:33:11.880] 我没有任何社交计划，我喜欢我的所有屏幕。而且我一直都在努力……
[00:33:18.280] kind of like wean off it a little bit because my addiction is really bad. I would say
[00:33:18.280] 有点像慢慢戒掉，因为我的瘾真的很严重。我会说
[00:33:22.560] I try to consume more of the lifestyle content that I was talking about. So I'll put on a video
[00:33:22.560] 我尽量多看一些我之前提到的生活方式类内容。所以我会上传一个视频。
[00:33:27.240] of someone journaling and then I will also journal with them. So it's like body doubling. And to me,
[00:33:27.240] 我会先让别人写日记，然后和他们一起写。这就像是角色互换一样。对我来说，
[00:33:31.460] that's sort of protective. But still, it's like a form of being plugged in. So yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:31.460] 这算是一种保护机制。但同时，也像是某种形式的联网状态。所以，嗯，我也不知道。
[00:33:38.140] I think I just need 40 different audio streams going on in my head at once always.
[00:33:38.140] 我觉得我需要脑子里同时播放 40 个不同的音频流。
[00:33:43.860] Yeah, I guess it's just finding something to fill the void. If you're busy doing something,
[00:33:43.860] 是的，我想这只是在寻找填补空虚感的东西。如果你忙着做某件事，
[00:33:48.200] whether it's a hobby or spending time with friends or spending time with family, especially just traveling
[00:33:48.200] 无论是爱好、与朋友共度时光还是与家人共度时光，尤其是旅行。
[00:33:53.220] or getting away, that's probably the easiest way to to unplug. But it's not exactly the cheapest way
[00:33:53.220] 或者逃离尘嚣，这可能是最简单的放松方式。但这并非最便宜的方式。
[00:33:59.240] to unplug. Yeah, I think it's just trying to fill the void. And for me, if I'm at the climbing gym,
[00:33:59.240] 放松一下。是啊，我觉得这只是为了填补内心的空虚。对我来说，如果我在攀岩馆，
[00:34:04.660] then it's easy for me to just not even do anything on my phone for two to three hours. If I'm alone,
[00:34:04.660] 这样我很容易就能两三个小时完全不用手机。如果我一个人，
[00:34:10.140] then it's a little bit harder because I need some time to rest. So I might just go on my phone to
[00:34:10.140] 那就有点难了，因为我需要休息一会儿。所以我可能就玩玩手机。
[00:34:14.220] force myself to take the time to rest. But if I'm with friends, then it's that time goes by very
[00:34:14.220] 我强迫自己抽出时间休息。但如果和朋友在一起，时间就会过得飞快。
[00:34:19.320] quickly. And I don't sometimes I just don't even look at my phone for a few hours.
[00:34:19.320] 很快。而且有时候我甚至几个小时都不看手机。
[00:34:23.260] I think for me, there's also an aspect of FOMO, I guess you feel like you're missing out on content or
[00:34:23.260] 我觉得对我来说，还有一种害怕错过（FOMO）的感觉，感觉自己好像错过了什么内容或者
[00:34:31.160] updates within whatever community you follow or something. There's like some really niche examples.
[00:34:31.160] 你关注的社群或其他类似社群的更新。也有一些非常小众的例子。
[00:34:38.780] Sometimes there's TikTok drama and people are like posting about their slow updates. But then
[00:34:38.780] 有时候TikTok上会出现一些drama，比如有人会发帖抱怨自己更新太慢。但是后来
[00:34:44.140] if you are unplugged for a while, you can totally miss it. And then you're like, oh, shit, like what
[00:34:44.140] 如果你一段时间没上网，你可能会完全错过很多东西。然后你就会想，哦，糟了，错过了什么？
[00:34:49.400] happened? I totally missed this whole saga. I think another example could be like if you didn't
[00:34:49.400] 发生了什么？我完全错过了整个事件。我觉得另一个例子可以是，如果你没有
[00:34:54.500] maybe watch a really popular TV show when it first came out, you miss out on that initial wave of
[00:34:54.500] 如果你在一部非常受欢迎的电视剧刚播出的时候去看，你可能会错过最初的那波热潮。
[00:35:01.760] extra content and like conversation. And then you feel like you're playing catch up. Maybe you missed
[00:35:01.760] 额外的内容和对话。然后你会感觉自己在追赶进度。也许你错过了
[00:35:08.040] the initial excitement. So now it's like just you. You don't get like that whole extra group
[00:35:08.040] 最初的兴奋劲儿过去了。现在就只剩下你一个人了。你不会再像以前那样和一大群人一起玩了。
[00:35:14.140] I guess feeling or community feeling almost. So I think those are some aspects that make it hard to
[00:35:14.140] 我想大概是某种感觉或者说社群感吧。所以我觉得这些方面让事情变得很难……
[00:35:20.660] unplug for me. It's interesting because I think that part has gotten better because of technology.
[00:35:20.660] 对我来说，这部分已经有所改善，这很有意思。
[00:35:26.740] Because for the water cooler talk stuff, if you didn't watch the episode from the previous night,
[00:35:26.740] 因为对于茶水间闲聊的话题，如果你没看前一晚播出的那集，
[00:35:32.460] then if you join in that conversation, one, you might not have anything to say, but then two,
[00:35:32.460] 那么，如果你加入到那场对话中，第一，你可能没什么可说的；第二，
[00:35:36.840] you might get spoilers versus me. I was busy the weekend that Arcane finished. And so I ended up
[00:35:36.840] 你可能会被剧透，而我可能没事。Arcane完结的那个周末我比较忙，所以最后……
[00:35:43.660] watching it. I think it was Monday. I had to purposely avoid all content for Arcane so that I
[00:35:43.660] 正在看。我想应该是星期一。我必须刻意避开所有关于《神秘学》的内容，这样我才能……
[00:35:49.740] wouldn't get spoiled about the end of it. But when I finished it, then I was able to go back and either
[00:35:49.740] 我不想被剧透结局。但当我读完之后，我就可以回头再看看，然后要么
[00:35:54.640] follow up on like the comments and friend group to talk about it or just go on Reddit and then read the
[00:35:54.640] 可以跟进评论，也可以和朋友群聊，或者直接去Reddit上看看。
[00:36:00.080] discussion. But I'm also not a someone who's going to post on Reddit. I'm more of a lurker in that regard.
[00:36:00.080] 参与讨论。但我也不是那种会在Reddit上发帖的人。在这方面，我更像是个潜水员。
[00:36:05.620] That's actually a good point. I do avoid social media when I'm behind on a show, especially if
[00:36:05.620] 这确实是个好主意。如果剧集进度落后，我确实会避免使用社交媒体，尤其是如果……
[00:36:12.980] it's a huge thing. You know, back in the day when it was like Game of Thrones, lately Arcane, I was
[00:36:12.980] 这是件大事。你知道，以前像《权力的游戏》那样火的时候，最近是《神秘学》，我当时……
[00:36:17.820] like, I just can't open anything like Reddit or Twitter just in case I accidentally get spoiled
[00:36:17.820] 我根本不敢打开Reddit或Twitter之类的网站，就怕不小心被剧透。
[00:36:23.800] on something because I know there's a lot of people I follow or my algorithm is tuned into this.
[00:36:23.800] 我关注某些人是因为我知道我关注的很多人，或者我的算法会针对这种情况进行推送。
[00:36:29.900] So I guess that's like something that helps you stay a little more unplugged, procrastinating.
[00:36:29.900] 所以我觉得这就像是一种能让你稍微放松一下、拖延一下的方法。
[00:36:37.280] It's like you're unplugging so that you could plug in at maximum satisfaction rate later.
[00:36:37.280] 这就像你暂时拔掉电源，以便之后能以最大的满足感重新连接。
[00:36:43.620] Seriously.
[00:36:43.620] 严重地。
[00:36:45.300] Which is not a bad thing because then you're really making a good use out of whatever
[00:36:45.300] 这并非坏事，因为这样你就能真正物尽其用了。
[00:36:49.280] you want to spend your time on. Again, you're not aimlessly searching for something or to your
[00:36:49.280] 你想把时间花在什么地方？再说一遍，你不是漫无目的地寻找什么，也不是在寻找什么。
[00:36:56.240] point, Jisoo, just like getting that 50% satisfaction hit. You want to you want to make sure you get the
[00:36:56.240] 关键在于，Jisoo，就像获得50%的满足感一样。你想确保你得到……
[00:37:01.680] most out of it.
[00:37:01.680] 充分利用它。
[00:37:02.500] That's true. Yeah.
[00:37:02.500] 没错。是的。
[00:37:04.300] I will say I feel like it's hard for me to visualize what unplugging looks like in the modern
[00:37:04.300] 我想说，我觉得很难想象在现代社会中“断网”是什么样子。
[00:37:09.040] day because it's really not just a phone thing. It's like a computer thing, too. And now I feel
[00:37:09.040] 因为这真的不仅仅是手机的问题，也涉及到电脑。现在我觉得
[00:37:16.340] like most of us have work computers that are just like absolute necessities to even be employed,
[00:37:16.340] 像我们大多数人一样，我们都拥有工作电脑，这对于我们来说就像是工作必需品一样。
[00:37:23.280] essentially. I don't know. Like what does unplugging look like now?
[00:37:23.280] 基本上是这样。我不知道。现在“拔掉电源”到底是什么意思？
[00:37:27.960] A weekend or like PTO. Wait, actually, this is really funny because I just came back from a trip
[00:37:27.960] 周末或者休假之类的。等等，其实这真的太搞笑了，因为我刚结束旅行回来。
[00:37:37.020] to China. Everyone knows how China has a lot of Western sites blocked. So I did feel like a little
[00:37:37.020] 去中国。大家都知道中国屏蔽了很多西方网站。所以我当时确实有点……
[00:37:43.560] bit in China. I was like unplugged. Like sometimes this content was just not reachable from where I was.
[00:37:43.560] 在中国的时候，我感觉自己像与世隔绝了一样。有时候，我所在的地方根本看不到这些内容。
[00:37:52.240] And so I was like missing out. But then at the same time, it forced me to be a little more in
[00:37:52.240] 所以我觉得我错过了很多。但与此同时，这也迫使我更加投入其中。
[00:37:58.580] tune with like what was happening around me, hanging out with the family that I was there for
[00:37:58.580] 我开始关注周围发生的事情，和家人待在一起，享受着为之付出的时光。
[00:38:02.660] and exploring a little more versus just like sitting at home and being on my phone and being like,
[00:38:02.660] 探索一下外面的世界，而不是像现在这样只是坐在家里玩手机，
[00:38:08.740] 10 more minutes or something.
[00:38:08.740] 再过十分钟左右吧。
[00:38:11.300] Which is interesting, too, because, yeah, it's filling the void with things that in reality probably do
[00:38:11.300] 这也很有趣，因为，是的，它用一些实际上可能确实会……的东西填补了空白。
[00:38:16.760] matter a little bit more to yourself because you're just you really are making a choice of saying,
[00:38:16.760] 对你而言，这或许更重要一些，因为你实际上是在做出选择，选择说：
[00:38:21.160] oh, I want to spend time with family. I want to be in the world around me instead of
[00:38:21.160] 哦，我想和家人待在一起。我想融入周围的世界，而不是……
[00:38:25.840] distracting myself with something on my phone or with technology. But I think times like that are also
[00:38:25.840] 我会用手机或其他电子产品分散自己的注意力。但我认为这样的时刻也是
[00:38:32.180] really important because then you can self-reflect on the stuff that you were missing out on.
[00:38:32.180] 这一点非常重要，因为这样你就可以反思自己错过了哪些东西。
[00:38:36.460] Like, do they really bring you value in your life? Like, do you really value those where when you go
[00:38:36.460] 比如，它们真的能给你的生活带来价值吗？比如，你真的重视那些当你去的时候会遇到的人或事吗？
[00:38:40.700] back, you might not have like that addiction to say, oh, I need to do this. It's like, do I really
[00:38:40.700] 以前，你可能不会像现在这样沉迷于此，然后说：“哦，我需要做这件事。” 你会想：“我真的需要吗？”
[00:38:45.940] want to do this? Is this something that I like value and want to keep in my plugged in life?
[00:38:45.940] 你想做这件事吗？这是我喜欢并重视的，也是我想在如今这个网络化生活中保留的东西吗？
[00:38:52.760] Okay, I have a question about unplugging. Do you think doing something that's like audio only
[00:38:52.760] 好的，我有个关于拔掉电源的问题。你觉得只拔掉电源（比如只拔掉音频）可以吗？
[00:38:59.200] counts as unplugging? Or do you think audio and visual counts for being plugged in?
[00:38:59.200] 这样算不算拔掉电源？还是说你认为音频和视频设备也算作连接电源？
[00:39:06.480] I think if you were just listening to music or something, I wouldn't consider that being plugged
[00:39:06.480] 我认为如果你只是在听音乐之类的，那不算插电。
[00:39:11.720] in. Yeah, the bar is probably different. I've never thought about this. It's music I don't
[00:39:11.720] 进去。是啊，酒吧可能不一样。我从没想过这个问题。这是我不听的音乐。
[00:39:17.860] consider as being plugged in as just kind of a extension of your life, like background music,
[00:39:17.860] 把上网看作是你生活的一种延伸，就像背景音乐一样。
[00:39:23.100] I guess. Podcasts too, because I feel like my podcasts are very purposeful. So I'll listen to
[00:39:23.100] 我想也是。播客也一样，因为我觉得我的播客很有意义。所以我也会听。
[00:39:28.700] Earcrust sometimes. Not always. Sorry, but especially like if the topic resonates with me,
[00:39:28.700] 有时候会耳垢，但不是每次都这样。不好意思，不过如果这个话题引起了我的共鸣，我会特别点赞。
[00:39:35.320] or I know that it'll resonate with me and I'll really enjoy it. I listen to like sports podcasts,
[00:39:35.320] 或者我知道它会引起我的共鸣，我会非常喜欢它。比如，我喜欢听体育播客。
[00:39:40.180] but like very specific ones for personalities that I like. And I'll listen to political podcasts. Like
[00:39:40.180] 但我会听一些特定人物的播客，比如我喜欢的那些。我还会听政治类播客。
[00:39:44.220] that's kind of the extent of my podcast listening. And those are just sources of information where I
[00:39:44.220] 这就是我听播客的全部内容了。这些只是我获取信息的一些来源。
[00:39:50.560] choose to get the information from there versus other mediums. But for me, it's also like I only
[00:39:50.560] 我选择从那里获取信息，而不是其他媒介。但对我来说，这就像我只是
[00:39:56.620] listen to podcasts when I drive. And since I don't go to work as much anymore, my podcast usage is also
[00:39:56.620] 我开车时会听播客。而且由于我现在上班次数不多，我听播客的时间也减少了。
[00:40:01.380] reduced a lot. So I think the bar is definitely a little bit different there. Maybe audio at home
[00:40:01.380] 降低了很多。所以我认为那里的标准肯定有点不一样了。也许是家庭音频的问题。
[00:40:07.220] just doesn't stimulate me enough to like capture my attention.
[00:40:07.220] 它不足以引起我的注意，让我感到兴奋。
[00:40:12.340] I don't know. I guess I would consider podcasts as being plugged in. Audiobooks too, a little bit.
[00:40:12.340] 我不知道。我觉得播客也算是接入互联网的一种方式。有声读物也算，但也没完全算。
[00:40:18.340] Because it's not just like noise anymore. I mean, not saying music is just noise, but
[00:40:18.340] 因为它不再仅仅是噪音了。我的意思是，我不是说音乐只是噪音，但是……
[00:40:24.120] I'm not like dissecting every word. Right, right. So it feels less like content. But I feel like
[00:40:24.120] 我不是要逐字逐句地分析。对，对。所以感觉不像是在做文章。但我感觉……
[00:40:29.520] podcasts and audiobooks do feel like content to me. And that's the hardest thing. I feel like a big
[00:40:29.520] 播客和有声书对我来说确实像是内容。而这恰恰是最难的。我觉得自己像个大人物
[00:40:34.800] part of unplugging that's difficult for me is if I truly didn't have anything, but like,
[00:40:34.800] 对我来说，最难的部分是彻底摆脱电子设备，如果我真的什么都没有，但比如，
[00:40:39.840] let's say I didn't even have music running on in the background or something. That silence,
[00:40:39.840] 假设我当时连背景音乐都没放。那种寂静，
[00:40:44.520] I feel like is a little bit hard for me to just like sit in. Yeah, that's just a little bit tough
[00:40:44.520] 我觉得要我坐在那里有点难。是啊，确实有点难。
[00:40:50.100] for unplugging. That's fair. I think personally, I'm actually very bad at multitasking. Maybe that
[00:40:50.100] 拔掉电源。这很合理。就我个人而言，我觉得我其实很不擅长一心多用。也许是这样吧。
[00:40:56.800] helps a bit because then it reduces the possibility of overloading myself with things. But I still do end
[00:40:56.800] 这有点帮助，因为这样可以减少我给自己安排过多事情的可能性。但我仍然会……
[00:41:02.600] up maybe watching a show while also just mindlessly browsing my phone. But I think it does help
[00:41:02.600] 我可能一边看电视一边漫不经心地浏览手机。但我认为这确实有帮助。
[00:41:09.000] sometimes when I'm like, oh, I should focus on this show because this is the kind of show where
[00:41:09.000] 有时候我会想，哦，我应该专注于这个节目，因为这是一个很特别的节目
[00:41:13.760] you have to pay a bit of attention to. And then it's a little easier to like pull myself away from
[00:41:13.760] 你得稍微注意一下。然后，我就更容易让自己从……中抽身出来。
[00:41:19.320] one of the extra screens to focus on like one main screen.
[00:41:19.320] 其中一个额外的屏幕可以像主屏幕一样集中显示。
[00:41:23.320] When do you guys feel like this kind of started in terms of the forced overstimulation? So when I was in
[00:41:23.320] 你们觉得这种强制性的过度刺激是从什么时候开始的？所以，当我还在……的时候
[00:41:31.820] college, I had to have music on while I was studying or like a show on in the background,
[00:41:31.820] 大学时，我学习的时候必须听音乐，或者开着电视之类的节目当背景音。
[00:41:36.800] which sounds counterproductive, but I just needed like something in the background for that.
[00:41:36.800] 这听起来似乎适得其反，但我只是需要一些东西来做背景音乐。
[00:41:42.380] And then even when I was working, at least in my previous role, when I had a little bit more time
[00:41:42.380] 即使在我工作的时候，至少在我之前的岗位上，当我时间稍微充裕一些的时候，也是如此。
[00:41:46.720] with less meetings, then I would have like a show on or like some music on in the background all
[00:41:46.720] 如果会议少一些，我可能就会想看个节目或者放点音乐当背景音乐了。
[00:41:51.520] working. And while my focus was work, it's just having something in the background. And then now
[00:41:51.520] 工作。虽然我的重心在工作上，但它只是在后台运行着。然后现在
[00:41:55.780] I don't have as much time. So I can't really do that. But like, when do you think that started for
[00:41:55.780] 我没那么多时间，所以真的做不到。不过，你觉得这种做法是什么时候开始的？
[00:42:00.840] you guys? And do you even remember, I guess, the time before that and like how that felt just kind of
[00:42:00.840] 你们呢？你们还记得，我想，在那之前的那段时间，以及当时的感觉吗？
[00:42:05.660] being maybe it's like, okay, with just being by yourself doing whatever you're doing?
[00:42:05.660] 或许感觉就像，好吧，就一个人待着，做你正在做的事情？
[00:42:12.280] So if I remember correctly, I got my first personal laptop in like elementary school.
[00:42:12.280] 如果我没记错的话，我的第一台个人笔记本电脑大概是在小学的时候得到的。
[00:42:18.240] So then I feel like that propelled me into being like a full blown laptop kid, which I almost feel
[00:42:18.240] 所以我觉得那件事让我彻底变成了一个“笔记本电脑迷”，我几乎感觉
[00:42:26.820] like is worse than being an iPad kid to a certain extent, because you can really only have so many
[00:42:26.820] 在某种程度上，喜欢iPad比沉迷iPad更糟糕，因为你拥有的东西毕竟是有限的。
[00:42:31.660] apps on at once. And I guess the iPad mode has changed now that you could do like the screen and
[00:42:31.660] 同时运行多个应用程序。我想现在iPad的模式已经改变了，因为你可以像这样操作屏幕和
[00:42:36.300] screen thing or like a picture in picture thing and have like a video streaming. But having a laptop
[00:42:36.300] 屏幕显示之类的功能，或者像画中画那样，还能播放视频。但前提是得有一台笔记本电脑。
[00:42:41.060] back then at a very early age kind of just made me very comfortable using technology. So I think that's
[00:42:41.060] 那时候我年纪很小，就非常习惯使用科技产品。所以我觉得这……
[00:42:46.760] why I'm so like brain rot now. But I will say the second stage of my brain rot journey happened
[00:42:46.760] 为什么我现在感觉像脑子都坏掉了。但我得说，我脑子坏掉的第二阶段开始了。
[00:42:53.660] with TikTok in 2019. Like I remember it so vividly, just how like shocking the short form content was,
[00:42:53.660] 2019年我开始接触TikTok。我至今仍然清晰地记得，当时短视频内容是多么令人震撼。
[00:43:01.940] and how digestible it was. And it just like sucked me in. And this was pre COVID era too. And I was
[00:43:01.940] 它真的很容易消化。它就像把我吸进去了一样。而且这还是在新冠疫情之前。我当时
[00:43:08.800] like, Oh my god, everyone needs to download it. And back then everyone was like, dude, why are you on
[00:43:08.800] 就像，我的天哪，每个人都需要下载它。而当时每个人都会说，哥们儿，你干嘛在这儿？
[00:43:12.760] fucking musically like that app is for kids? Little did they know? Yeah, little did they know it will
[00:43:12.760] 这音乐软件简直就是给小孩子用的？他们哪知道？是啊，他们哪知道它会这样
[00:43:20.240] take over the world in just a short couple of years. I think similar to Jisoo, when I was pretty young,
[00:43:20.240] 短短几年内征服世界。我觉得和Jisoo很像，我年轻的时候，
[00:43:26.340] I started to multitask on the internet. And I think one of the biggest things was us having like, aim
[00:43:26.340] 我开始在互联网上同时处理多项任务。我认为其中最重要的一点是我们拥有了类似 Aim 的功能。
[00:43:35.280] chat messaging apps, then I would be maybe doing homework. But then the moment you hear like a little
[00:43:35.280] 如果我用聊天软件，那我可能正在做作业。但当你听到类似……的声音时，我就会想……
[00:43:42.640] ping from the chat messaging app, you jump to it and you try to like respond and have conversation.
[00:43:42.640] 你收到聊天应用发来的消息，立刻打开并尝试回复和聊天。
[00:43:48.800] And I think that like started to leak into everything a little bit. Even if I was just
[00:43:48.800] 我觉得这种感觉开始慢慢渗透到方方面面。即使我只是
[00:43:55.120] doing something for fun, like maybe I was watching a show, maybe I was like watching a movie. When
[00:43:55.120] 做些有趣的事情，比如看电视节目，或者看电影。
[00:43:59.720] someone chats you, immediately your attention is drawn and you start multitasking. You know, now that
[00:43:59.720] 有人跟你聊天，你的注意力立刻就被吸引住了，然后你就开始一心二用。你知道，现在这样
[00:44:05.840] I'm really reflecting, I'm also realizing that when I watched YouTube, I read the comments a lot. So I
[00:44:05.840] 我一直在反思，也意识到我以前看YouTube视频的时候，经常会看评论。所以……
[00:44:12.160] actually also end up watching while simultaneously reading the comments. Even if I'm watching YouTube on
[00:44:12.160] 实际上，我经常一边看视频一边看评论。即使我是在YouTube上看视频的时候也是如此。
[00:44:18.700] like my TV, I'll pull up the comments. And then you know how it's like, kind of on the side, you can do
[00:44:18.700] 就像打开电视一样，我会调出评论。然后你知道，就像在旁边，你可以……
[00:44:24.100] both. So I'm like, Oh shit, actually, I do definitely multitask a lot, even if it's using just one screen.
[00:44:24.100] 两者都有。所以我就想，糟了，其实我确实经常同时处理多项任务，即使只用一个屏幕。
[00:44:30.840] So I think like these kinds of things help feel the whole being glued to the screen kind of thing.
[00:44:30.840] 所以我觉得这些东西有助于营造一种被屏幕牢牢吸引的感觉。
[00:44:37.000] When I finally caved and downloaded TikTok, I was like, okay, I see now I can see why everyone's
[00:44:37.000] 当我最终屈服并下载了TikTok之后，我心想，好吧，我现在明白为什么大家都这么喜欢它了。
[00:44:44.320] like so obsessed. And I understand the like pull of the short form content and how easy it is to just
[00:44:44.320] 简直太着迷了。我理解短视频内容的吸引力，也明白它有多么容易让人沉迷。
[00:44:50.660] scroll away your time. So for sure, all of that, I could feel my attention span dropping from it.
[00:44:50.660] 你只是在不停地滑动屏幕，消磨时间。所以，毫无疑问，我能感觉到我的注意力越来越难以集中。
[00:44:57.720] So I do want to circle back on like unplugging specifically. We talk a lot about wanting to
[00:44:57.720] 所以我想再详细说说“断网”这个话题。我们经常谈到想要……
[00:45:03.480] unplug or like times that we can unplug. But what do you think really are the benefits of
[00:45:03.480] 放下电子设备，或者说，享受我们可以放下电子设备的时光。但你认为放下电子设备的真正好处是什么？
[00:45:08.460] unplugging for you personally? I think one of the biggest benefits of unplugging is almost like
[00:45:08.460] 对你个人而言，断网放松真的好吗？我觉得断网放松最大的好处之一几乎就像……
[00:45:15.220] forcing yourself to be productive in real life. I think sometimes when I sit on the couch and rot,
[00:45:15.220] 强迫自己在现实生活中保持高效。我觉得有时候当我瘫在沙发上虚度光阴的时候，
[00:45:22.800] it's forcing me to procrastinate on like real life responsibilities, whether that's just like small
[00:45:22.800] 这迫使我拖延现实生活中的责任，无论这些责任多么微不足道。
[00:45:28.700] errands, maybe like grocery shopping or like cleaning the house or something of that sort. So I think it does
[00:45:28.700] 跑腿办事，比如去超市买菜、打扫房子之类的。所以我觉得确实如此。
[00:45:35.300] reduce that procrastination a bit. And then it ultimately leads to a bit of a better organized
[00:45:35.300] 减少一些拖延症。最终，这会让你的生活更有条理。
[00:45:44.040] day almost where maybe you are able to finish all your errands. And then at the end of the day,
[00:45:44.040] 几乎一整天的时间里，你或许都能完成所有要做的事情。然后到了晚上，
[00:45:50.460] you have free time and you're like, okay, I can guilt free plug in and, you know, waste some time.
[00:45:50.460] 你有了空闲时间，然后你会想，好吧，我可以毫无愧疚地上网，你知道，浪费一些时间。
[00:45:56.180] So I do think that's like a huge benefit, just like helping you get your shit done earlier.
[00:45:56.180] 所以我认为这确实是一个很大的好处，就像可以帮助你更早地完成工作一样。
[00:46:01.220] Yeah, I would agree. Because it's like a tier list of why I do the things that I do. So the things that
[00:46:01.220] 是的，我同意。因为这就像一个我做这些事情的原因的优先级列表。所以，那些事情……
[00:46:06.700] I really want to do, like I'll get done, that has a higher priority over the brain rot activities.
[00:46:06.700] 我真的很想做这件事，而且我一定会完成它，这件事比那些浪费脑力的活动优先级更高。
[00:46:12.120] If I don't want to do something, sometimes it's just easy to like pull out my phone,
[00:46:12.120] 如果我不想做某件事，有时候最简单的办法就是拿出手机。
[00:46:15.980] go on Instagram, start doom scrolling on reels or looking to see what's the latest posts on Reddit
[00:46:15.980] 打开 Instagram，开始漫无目的地浏览 Reels 短视频，或者看看 Reddit 上的最新帖子。
[00:46:22.780] and the subreddit that I follow. It's kind of putting my phone down or stepping away from the
[00:46:22.780] 还有我关注的子版块。这就像放下手机或者暂时离开……
[00:46:27.820] computer and actually going to do the things that I need to do, whether that's my actual work or errands
[00:46:27.820] 用电脑做我需要做的事情，无论是我的工作还是跑腿办事。
[00:46:34.160] or just things that I've procrastinated on. So it's really just taking away the distractions.
[00:46:34.160] 或者只是我一直拖延的事情。所以，关键在于排除干扰。
[00:46:39.800] The other thing would be and kind of going back to the what we were talking about, like signs that
[00:46:39.800] 还有一点，有点像我们刚才讨论的话题，比如一些迹象表明……
[00:46:45.540] you need to unplug, because sometimes it's good to unplug even when you're not really having those
[00:46:45.540] 你需要拔掉电源，因为有时候即使你并没有真的遇到那些问题，拔掉电源也是有好处的。
[00:46:49.700] negative effects. But when you have those negative effects, where sometimes I'll just be online
[00:46:49.700] 负面影响。但当你遇到这些负面影响时，有时我就会一直待在网上。
[00:46:54.260] and I just feel like shit, and I just keep going. And then it just kind of continues,
[00:46:54.260] 我感觉糟透了，但我还是继续干下去。然后，这种情况就一直持续下去了。
[00:46:58.400] where it's kind of like taking yourself and like breaking away from that. So I think there's also
[00:46:58.400] 这有点像是把自己从那种环境中抽离出来。所以我觉得还有这种感觉。
[00:47:02.980] like a big mental health benefit of really doing things that are good for you, again, and not
[00:47:02.980] 比如，做一些真正对你有益的事情，会对心理健康带来巨大的好处，而且并非如此。
[00:47:09.840] procrastinating. Yeah, I think I agree with both of you. For me personally, I feel like there's a big
[00:47:09.840] 拖延症。嗯，我觉得我同意你们俩的看法。就我个人而言，我觉得这方面有很大的问题。
[00:47:16.760] sense of derealization that happens if I sit online too long. It kind of makes me live my life,
[00:47:16.760] 如果我上网时间过长，就会产生一种现实感缺失的感觉。它让我感觉自己仿佛在过着真正的生活。
[00:47:24.260] as like a content consumer and not like a real person. So once I start to like really feel that
[00:47:24.260] 感觉自己像个内容消费者，而不是个真人。所以一旦我开始真正喜欢上这种感觉……
[00:47:30.180] derealization, and I'm like, holy shit, I'm like not a real person right now. Unplugging helps me reset
[00:47:30.180] 出现现实感丧失，我感觉自己像个疯子，天哪，我现在根本不像个真人。断开网络连接能让我重新振作起来。
[00:47:35.460] that. And then I can consume the real world as content instead of digitally. I think the other
[00:47:35.460] 那样的话，我就可以把现实世界当作内容来消费，而不是通过数字方式。我觉得另一个
[00:47:41.780] benefit to of unplugging is it helps to like reset the pace of life again, especially when you're very
[00:47:41.780] 断网的好处在于它有助于重新调整生活节奏，尤其是在你非常忙碌的时候。
[00:47:47.960] used to like short form content. I feel like you're used to life being in that sense to stepping away
[00:47:47.960] 以前喜欢短视频内容。我觉得你已经习惯了那种远离尘嚣的生活状态。
[00:47:53.860] from the screen for a little bit or maybe like logging out of TikTok for a little bit also helps
[00:47:53.860] 暂时放下手机，或者比如暂时退出TikTok，也有帮助。
[00:47:58.060] to kind of reset back to where normal life pace is. That makes sense. I think another one is just like
[00:47:58.060] 算是重新调整到正常的生活节奏。这很有道理。我觉得另一个也差不多是这样。
[00:48:05.300] it's good to remind yourself to unplug every now and then because you don't want to be like the iPad
[00:48:05.300] 时不时提醒自己放下电子设备是件好事，因为你不想变成像iPad那样的人。
[00:48:11.100] kid at the dinner table. I think it's like easy to get sucked in and then not even realize you're
[00:48:11.100] 餐桌上的孩子。我觉得很容易就被卷进去，然后甚至都没意识到自己……
[00:48:18.140] scrolling your phone when you're having a dinner with friends and then miss out on that dinner
[00:48:18.140] 和朋友吃饭时低头刷手机，结果错过了这顿晚餐。
[00:48:23.520] essentially because you're somewhere else in the internet world. So sometimes seeing that happen
[00:48:23.520] 本质上是因为你身处互联网世界的其他地方。所以有时候会看到这种情况发生。
[00:48:29.740] in real life is a good wake up call or reminder like, oh, we had dinner with friends and like half
[00:48:29.740] 在现实生活中，这就像一个很好的警醒或提醒，比如，“哦，我们和朋友们一起吃了顿饭，结果……一半……”
[00:48:36.400] of us were just on our phones and like did we really have dinner together? Well, despite all of our
[00:48:36.400] 我们几个都低头玩手机，心想：我们真的一起吃过晚饭吗？好吧，尽管我们
[00:48:43.960] mild to extreme connection to the internet, do you think you've been working towards slash achieving a
[00:48:43.960] 从轻微到极度依赖互联网，你认为你一直在努力实现的是……
[00:48:52.780] healthier balance in your life with technology? I want to say yes. Just kind of realizing the things
[00:48:52.780] 科技与生活之间能否达到更健康的平衡？我想说是的。只是逐渐意识到这一点。
[00:49:00.940] that I prioritize over the like, as we talked about the brain rot activities, I want to make a better use
[00:49:00.940] 比起其他事情，就像我们之前讨论的那些会损害大脑的活动，我想更好地利用它们。
[00:49:07.620] of my time. I guess I'm like training myself to be okay with those lulls. And I think those are the
[00:49:07.620] 在我的时间里。我想我正在训练自己接受这些平静期。而且我认为那些就是
[00:49:14.740] hardest times. It's like lull in conversation at like a dinner table or lull during a TV show when I pull
[00:49:14.740] 最艰难的时刻。就像餐桌上谈话陷入沉寂，或者电视节目播放到一半突然停下来，这时我就会停下来。
[00:49:21.280] out my phone, getting rid of those things so I can really just kind of be present for whatever I'm
[00:49:21.280] 把手机扔掉，摆脱那些东西，这样我才能真正专注于当下。
[00:49:26.540] trying to do. The healthy balance of getting what I need to get done and not letting myself get
[00:49:26.540] 努力做到。在完成我需要做的事情和不让自己陷入困境之间找到健康的平衡。
[00:49:32.560] distracted because sometimes it's okay to get distracted and just let loose and just de-stress.
[00:49:32.560] 注意力分散是因为有时候注意力分散一下也没什么不好，可以放松一下，缓解压力。
[00:49:37.620] But I think just not being consumed by it, that's where the healthy balance really comes into play.
[00:49:37.620] 但我认为，不被它所吞噬，这才是健康平衡的真正体现。
[00:49:42.940] Yeah, for sure. You don't necessarily have to just like completely unplug and like cut it off cold
[00:49:42.940] 当然。你不一定非要完全拔掉电源，把它彻底切断。
[00:49:48.920] turkey and like never touch a phone or internet again. I think it's like totally okay to allow
[00:49:48.920] 吃火鸡，然后就再也不碰手机或网络了。我觉得完全没问题。
[00:49:56.020] yourself to have that time to like have brain rot. But as long as it's not affecting the rest of your
[00:49:56.020] 给自己一些时间，让大脑慢慢衰退。但只要它不影响你的其他方面……
[00:50:03.260] life to the point where it's negative and you're not being as productive or losing yourself into the
[00:50:03.260] 生活变得消极，导致你效率低下或迷失自我。
[00:50:10.940] depths of the internet. So I think, yes, it's a constant battle, but it's something that's top of
[00:50:10.940] 互联网深处。所以我觉得，是的，这是一场持续不断的战斗，但它是最重要的事情之一。
[00:50:18.380] mind more often. I do like how our phones tell us our screen times now. So I actually pin that to my
[00:50:18.380] 更频繁地想起这件事。我确实很喜欢现在手机会显示屏幕使用时间的功能。所以我实际上会把这个功能记在我的手机上。我很喜欢这一点。我经常会把这个功能记在我的手机上。我很喜欢现在手机会显示屏幕使用时间的功能。所以我会把它记在我的手机上。
[00:50:25.280] home screen so I can get a quick glance and it's kind of a friendly little reminder every time I look at my
[00:50:25.280] 放在主屏幕上，这样我就可以快速浏览一下，而且每次我看屏幕的时候，它都像是一个友好的小提醒。
[00:50:31.640] phone. Yeah, I feel like this is going to be one of those things that continues to be a work in
[00:50:31.640] 电话。是的，我觉得这会是那种需要持续改进的事情之一。
[00:50:36.760] progress for me. I actually very much enjoy being chronically online and I don't necessarily think
[00:50:36.760] 对我来说，这是一种进步。我其实很享受长时间在线的状态，而且我并不一定认为……
[00:50:42.000] of it as like a personal pitfall yet. But I do feel like there are opportunities to build out healthy
[00:50:42.000] 目前我还没有把它视为个人陷阱。但我确实觉得有机会去建立健康的生活方式。
[00:50:48.360] habits during times where I don't necessarily need screen time, especially with bedtime hygiene and
[00:50:48.360] 在我不需要使用电子产品的时候，我会养成一些习惯，尤其是在睡前保持良好的卫生习惯。
[00:50:55.180] going to bed without my phone or like waking up and getting ready without having something playing in
