[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Tiffany.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo，我是Tiffany。
[00:00:15.860] Welcome back, Tiffy. It's been a while. Last time Tiffy was on the podcast with us
[00:00:15.860] 欢迎回来，蒂菲。好久不见了。蒂菲上次来我们播客节目是什么时候？
[00:00:21.300] was episode number 176, the K-pop concert experience, which is a good listen. And also
[00:00:21.300] 第176集是K-pop演唱会体验，值得一听。
[00:00:28.660] I'm glad we recorded that because all three of us are actually going to go to a K-pop
[00:00:28.660] 我很庆幸我们录下了那段视频，因为我们三个真的要去参加一场K-pop演唱会。
[00:00:33.860] concert together soon, which is pretty exciting. We brought Tiffy on again today because we thought
[00:00:33.860] 很快就能一起举办演唱会了，真是太令人兴奋了。今天我们再次请来Tiffy，是因为我们觉得
[00:00:40.020] she would be the perfect guest to talk about going through tough times, how we like to personally
[00:00:40.020] 她将是谈论如何度过难关以及我们如何亲身经历的最佳嘉宾。
[00:00:45.220] handle it and also how to support friends who are going through tough times as well.
[00:00:45.220] 如何处理这种情况，以及如何支持同样正在经历艰难时期的朋友。
[00:00:49.380] Tiffy is someone who I consider a very good role model as like an archetype of good friend.
[00:00:49.380] 蒂菲是我心目中非常好的榜样，她就像是好朋友的典范。
[00:00:55.780] So I'm excited to talk through going through tough times with her today.
[00:00:55.780] 所以我很兴奋今天能和她聊聊如何度过难关。
[00:00:59.060] So let's kick this off by talking about our personal experiences. Do you guys ever go through
[00:00:59.060] 那么，我们就先从聊聊各自的经历开始吧。你们有没有过这样的经历？
[00:01:05.140] times in life that feel particularly tough and what do you personally like to do to feel better
[00:01:05.140] 人生中哪些时刻感觉特别艰难？你个人喜欢做什么来让自己感觉好一些？
[00:01:10.420] or get through these times? Well, I think it's a given that we probably all go through some tough
[00:01:10.420] 或者说，我们能否度过这段时期？嗯，我认为我们所有人都会经历一些艰难时期，这似乎是理所当然的。
[00:01:18.900] times, but I think for me if it's kind of a big emotional event, then I tend to retreat a bit
[00:01:18.900] 有时候会这样，但我觉得对我来说，如果是比较重大的情绪事件，我就会倾向于退缩一些。
[00:01:26.660] and spend time processing it by myself for a bit before I start reaching out to other people such
[00:01:26.660] 我会花点时间独自消化一下，然后再开始联系其他人。
[00:01:35.140] as friends or family. I do the same actually. If I'm going through something tough, I'll typically
[00:01:35.140] 就像朋友或家人一样。实际上我也是这么做的。如果我遇到困难，我通常会……
[00:01:41.300] like process it by myself first or spiral by myself first and try to really like come to terms with
[00:01:41.300] 比如先自己消化一下，或者先自己反复思考，然后试着真正地接受它。
[00:01:47.380] the situation and what's going on before I reach out. A lot of times I won't even reach out because
[00:01:47.380] 我会先了解情况和正在发生的事情，然后再联系对方。很多时候我甚至都不会主动联系，因为
[00:01:52.100] I'll come to a conclusion by myself after a couple of days thinking about it or I'll reach
[00:01:52.100] 我会自己思考几天后得出结论，或者我会达成共识。
[00:01:57.220] out to my partner who's always there. It is easy to just start the conversation with them or bring up concern.
[00:01:57.220] 跟我的伴侣倾诉，他总是在我身边。跟他/她开启对话或者提出我的担忧都很容易。
[00:02:03.860] I think that's very relatable. There's a lot of vulnerability that comes with being able to even
[00:02:03.860] 我觉得这很有共鸣。能够做到这一点，也伴随着很多脆弱性。
[00:02:10.020] talk about whatever you're going through with other people. I feel like there's a variety of
[00:02:10.020] 和别人倾诉你正在经历的一切。我觉得有很多种方式可以做到这一点。
[00:02:14.580] different reasons that cause us to isolate too, right? Whether maybe we don't want to burden other
[00:02:14.580] 导致我们自我隔离的原因有很多，对吧？或许我们只是不想给别人添麻烦。
[00:02:19.460] people or it might sometimes feel uncomfortable just talking about it at all. But I think for me,
[00:02:19.460] 人们有时会觉得谈论这件事很尴尬，或者根本就不想谈。但我觉得对我来说，
[00:02:26.340] if I look back on my past behavior, I've kind of changed over the years. Before I started living
[00:02:26.340] 回顾我过去的行为，这些年来我确实有所改变。在我开始生活之前
[00:02:33.060] with James, I would say I was the type of person to talk about my issues a lot with friends and I
[00:02:33.060] 和詹姆斯在一起的时候，我会说我是那种经常和朋友倾诉自己烦恼的人，而且
[00:02:39.940] would seek constant advice about it. Maybe not even advice but I would just like enjoy talking about
[00:02:39.940] 我会不断寻求这方面的建议。也许算不上建议，我只是想享受谈论这件事的乐趣。
[00:02:45.700] what I was going through and saw it as almost like a currency or like token of friendship.
[00:02:45.700] 我当时的经历，让我感觉它就像一种货币，或者说是一种友谊的象征。
[00:02:50.900] But I think now that I've started to live with James and have been doing so for the last couple
[00:02:50.900] 但我觉得，自从我开始和詹姆斯一起生活，并且已经这样生活了几个月之后……
[00:02:55.380] of years, I've noticed that I don't actually do that as much anymore. And when I'm going through
[00:02:55.380] 多年来，我注意到我其实不再经常这样做了。当我经历……
[00:03:00.020] something, I really just process it mainly with James who is my partner. Do you feel like you miss
[00:03:00.020] 有些事，我主要都是跟我的伴侣詹姆斯一起消化。你觉得你想念他吗？
[00:03:07.060] the support from friendship? Just because I'm imagining that if you process a lot of this stuff
[00:03:07.060] 来自友谊的支持？我只是觉得，如果你处理了很多这类事情，可能会有这样的支持。
[00:03:13.460] with just James, then sometimes you're limited to just your two perspectives. I think I do but
[00:03:13.460] 如果只有詹姆斯一个人，那么有时你的视角就仅限于你们两个人。我想我的确如此，但是
[00:03:20.820] it's also a little bit different. So I guess the easiest way to put it is when I was younger,
[00:03:20.820] 也略有不同。所以我想最简单的说法就是，当我年轻的时候，
[00:03:28.100] especially in high school and college, I feel like my tough times were really about the guy that I
[00:03:28.100] 尤其是在高中和大学时期，我觉得我遇到的困难时期都和那个我爱的人有关。
[00:03:34.100] was seeing or like crushing after or you know some sort of like drama that I feel like is a
[00:03:34.100] 感觉像是看到了什么，或者像暗恋一样，或者你知道，某种戏剧性的事情，我觉得是……
[00:03:38.740] little bit more fun to talk about and discuss with your friends. But now that we're in our late 20s,
[00:03:38.740] 和朋友们聊聊这些话题会更有趣一些。但现在我们都快30岁了，
[00:03:44.180] I'm married now. I feel like the tough times that I go through now are significantly less fun to talk
[00:03:44.180] 我现在结婚了。我觉得现在经历的那些艰难时刻，谈论起来就没那么有趣了。
[00:03:50.180] about. So it's like oh I feel stressed out about work or maybe I miss my family who live far or you
[00:03:50.180] 大概是这样。比如，哦，我感觉工作压力很大，或者我想念远方的家人，或者你
[00:03:56.660] know I have concerns about x y and z which are like natural parts of being your late 20s. Like I feel
[00:03:56.660] 我知道我对x、y和z有些担忧，这些担忧就像是接近三十岁时自然而然会遇到的问题。就像我感觉
[00:04:02.420] like these things aren't as fun. So like before maybe my problems were things that I was like oh
[00:04:02.420] 感觉这些事没那么有趣了。所以以前，我的问题可能是一些让我觉得“哦”的事情。
[00:04:07.300] this might be kind of entertaining for my friends like time to go spill the tea or like talk about
[00:04:07.300] 这或许会让我朋友们觉得挺有意思的，就像是时候去八卦一下或者聊聊了。
[00:04:12.420] my guy problems and maybe it'll be funny. But now I'm like damn do I really want to trauma dump on
[00:04:12.420] 我跟男朋友之间有些问题，也许会挺搞笑的。但现在我感觉，我真的想把所有创伤都倾泻出来吗？
[00:04:17.460] my friends about how certain things in my life have been really tough? So I think it's just
[00:04:17.460] 我跟朋友们说起我生活中某些事情有多么艰难？所以我觉得这只是
[00:04:23.220] that also has to do with why I share a little bit less now. I think that makes a lot of sense. Like
[00:04:23.220] 这也跟我现在分享得少了一些有关。我觉得这很有道理。
[00:04:28.580] when you say trauma dumping on your friends, I feel like also now we're a little more self-aware
[00:04:28.580] 你说把创伤倾倒在朋友身上，我觉得现在我们也更有自知之明了。
[00:04:33.620] in the state we are in life about expressing ourselves or putting a lot of burden on a friend
[00:04:33.620] 我们现在的生活状态，是表达自我，还是给朋友带来太多负担？
[00:04:38.100] when you have to like talk about something because you might put them in a difficult situation where
[00:04:38.100] 当你不得不谈论某件事的时候，因为你可能会让他们陷入困境，
[00:04:41.780] it's uncomfortable for them or they feel stressed for you because you're so stressed about the
[00:04:41.780] 这让他们感到不舒服，或者他们会因为你压力太大而替你感到压力。
[00:04:46.340] situation. And it's like a lot of emotions to put on someone. So we're more like conscientious
[00:04:46.340] 这种情况。而且感觉要把很多情绪强加给一个人。所以我们更像是尽责的。
[00:04:52.100] about what we say to people I feel like. So it makes it easier to just spill the tea to like
[00:04:52.100] 我觉得这跟我们跟别人说的话有关。所以，跟别人说这些话就更容易了。
[00:04:58.020] your partner that you already live with because you don't have to give context when you talk about
[00:04:58.020] 和你已经同居的伴侣谈论这件事，因为你不需要提供背景信息。
[00:05:01.620] things, right? Yeah that's a good point. I feel like sometimes sharing an emotional story or even
[00:05:01.620] 事情就是这样，对吧？嗯，你说得对。我觉得有时候分享一个感人的故事，或者甚至
[00:05:10.180] just a story in general suddenly turns into this giant like super long story time with friends
[00:05:10.180] 本来只是个普通的故事，突然就变成了和朋友们一起讲故事的超长篇大论。
[00:05:16.500] where as you said you have to give the background context like why certain things are important,
[00:05:16.500] 正如你所说，你必须提供背景信息，比如为什么某些事情很重要。
[00:05:22.180] certain details are important in the story. But if you have like a partner who's there all the time
[00:05:22.180] 故事中某些细节很重要。但如果你有一个一直陪伴在你身边的伴侣……
[00:05:28.020] then they have been building up this background knowledge of context already. So it's easier to
[00:05:28.020] 那么他们就已经积累了这方面的背景知识。所以更容易……
[00:05:33.140] just like oh my god this happened and they already know everything all the history and
[00:05:33.140] 就像“我的天哪，这事发生了，他们居然已经知道一切，包括所有历史”一样。
[00:05:37.700] everything behind it. So Crystal me and Jisoo both live with our partners how is it like for you
[00:05:37.700] 背后的一切。所以，Crystal，我和Jisoo都和各自的伴侣住在一起，你们感觉如何？
[00:05:43.140] in a relationship but you don't actually live with your partner so you don't see them every single
[00:05:43.140] 你们处于恋爱关系中，但实际上并不住在一起，所以你们不能每天都见面。
[00:05:47.060] day? I think with a partner who doesn't live with me I definitely don't have his time as readily
[00:05:47.060] 白天？我觉得如果伴侣不住在一起，我肯定没那么容易得到他的时间。
[00:05:54.020] available as you two might be able to have with your partners and I think because of that for sure
[00:05:54.020] 你们俩或许可以和各自的伴侣一起享受这种待遇，我认为正因如此，肯定如此。
[00:06:00.660] there's some context building that he doesn't get to see or hear about since we're not together like
[00:06:00.660] 因为我们不在一起，所以他看不到也听不到一些背景信息。
[00:06:08.660] all the time. But I do think over time as the relationship grows and gets longer there's
[00:06:08.660] 一直都是这样。但我认为随着时间的推移，随着关系的加深和发展，会逐渐出现这种情况。
[00:06:14.660] definitely more of that he gets to hear much more detail about my life than probably the average
[00:06:14.660] 他肯定比一般人更有机会听到更多关于我生活的细节。
[00:06:21.940] friend right? Just any minor conveniences or even notable inconveniences he'd probably be the first
[00:06:21.940] 朋友对吧？哪怕是一些小小的便利，甚至是比较明显的麻烦，他可能都会第一个伸出援手。
[00:06:29.540] person to hear about it so I think it's like still in that process of building up the context and the
[00:06:29.540] 让别人听到这件事，所以我认为这仍然处于构建背景和……的过程中。
[00:06:34.820] history but I don't know. I don't know what it's like to have a partner who lives with you and like
[00:06:34.820] 历史方面我不太了解。我不知道和伴侣一起生活是什么感觉，也不知道和伴侣一起生活是什么感觉。
[00:06:39.940] have them know so much about you literally like your day-to-day schedule and like everything
[00:06:39.940] 让他们对你了如指掌，包括你的日常作息和所有你喜欢的东西。
[00:06:45.140] so detailed. I think actually what you said about not having his time readily available makes a lot
[00:06:45.140] 细节真多。我觉得你说的他没有那么多时间这一点确实很有道理。
[00:06:50.980] of sense and that kind of connects to maybe why we share less of what we're going through with our
[00:06:50.980] 感觉上，这或许可以解释为什么我们不太愿意与他人分享我们正在经历的事情。
[00:06:56.500] friends nowadays. It's like you only have a very fixed amount of time in your week to like talk
[00:06:56.500] 现在的朋友，感觉一周里只有很有限的时间可以聊天。
[00:07:02.260] to friends or hang out with them and a lot of your energy is being sucked into like maybe work or
[00:07:02.260] 和朋友聚会或外出，你的很多精力都被消耗在工作或其他事情上了。
[00:07:06.900] like the day-to-day life so then how much of that time that I have with my friends do I want to spend
[00:07:06.900] 就像日常生活一样，那么我究竟想把和朋友相处的时间花多少呢？
[00:07:12.500] talking about certain things? I will say the positive side about being able to share these
[00:07:12.500] 谈论某些事情？我会说能够分享这些事情的积极一面。
[00:07:17.380] things with my partner is you know sometimes these tough times are like just a one-day thing right?
[00:07:17.380] 我和伴侣之间的问题，你知道，有时候这些艰难时期就像是只会持续一天的事情，对吧？
[00:07:22.500] It's like oh I had a rough day today that really sucked this thing happened I'm not feeling good
[00:07:22.500] 感觉就像，哦，我今天过得很糟糕，发生了这么一件糟心事，我感觉很不舒服。
[00:07:26.500] but I think there are other times where the tough times are like longer so when I'm going through
[00:07:26.500] 但我认为有时候艰难时期会持续更长时间，所以当我经历这些的时候……
[00:07:32.660] like a period of time where for a couple of weeks I just feel really down. I don't want to talk to
[00:07:32.660] 就像有那么一段时间，连续几个星期我都感觉非常沮丧。我不想跟任何人说话。
[00:07:37.060] people. I don't want to engage in anything. I'm having maybe like a mini depressive episode or
[00:07:37.060] 我不想和任何人接触。我可能有点轻微的抑郁发作。
[00:07:42.340] something. I feel like it's nice to have someone consistently there to be able to support passively
[00:07:42.340] 我觉得有人一直在那里默默支持我挺好的。
[00:07:48.100] without me having to be like messaging someone like hey I feel down today like next day hey I
[00:07:48.100] 我不用像第二天那样发信息告诉别人“嘿，我今天心情不好”，嘿，
[00:07:53.220] feel down today etc etc like it's a little bit less high maintenance feeling as well.
[00:07:53.220] 今天心情有点低落等等，感觉好像没那么难伺候了。
[00:07:58.580] I think that makes a lot of sense. Another thought that just occurred to me is that if I'm actively
[00:07:58.580] 我觉得这很有道理。我突然想到，如果我积极主动地……
[00:08:04.260] kind of like you're saying actively in a I don't know emotional episode or something because I
[00:08:04.260] 就像你说的，我正积极地陷入某种情绪波动之类的，因为我
[00:08:09.300] don't live with my partner that means I have to as you mentioned like kind of stop in my day and
[00:08:09.300] 我不和伴侣住在一起，这意味着我必须像你提到的那样，在日常生活中稍微停顿一下。
[00:08:14.740] like reach out to them. I have to stop everything text and be like oh my god like this just happened
[00:08:14.740] 比如联系他们。我得停下所有发短信的事，然后像天哪一样，感觉就像刚刚发生的事一样。
[00:08:20.180] I'm so like annoyed or this is like really whatever versus I'm imagining if you just live
[00:08:20.180] 我真的好烦，或者说这真的无所谓，而我却在想，如果你就这么活着会怎么样。
[00:08:26.260] with them then you're going through this trouble and they're just there and you're like dude this
[00:08:26.260] 跟他们一起，你费尽周折，他们却只在那儿，你就会想：老兄，这算什么？
[00:08:30.660] is so annoying like I can't believe this is happening right yeah and I feel like sometimes
[00:08:30.660] 真是太烦人了，我简直不敢相信这种事竟然发生了，是啊，我觉得有时候
[00:08:35.300] when you live with them you talk about your day and everything it's as if they're going through
[00:08:35.300] 当你和他们一起生活时，你会谈论你一天中发生的事情，所有的一切，就好像他们也在经历着同样的事情一样。
[00:08:39.780] the experience with you in a sense but that takes us to another point where like we shouldn't over
[00:08:39.780] 从某种意义上说，和你在一起的经历是这样的，但这又引出了另一个问题，那就是我们不应该过度。
[00:08:46.100] burden our partner sometimes where instead of like trauma dumping as we like to call it on our
[00:08:46.100] 有时，我们会给伴侣带来负担，而不是像我们常说的“创伤倾倒”。
[00:08:51.940] friends you do that to someone who's easier more convenient like our partners so that's something
[00:08:51.940] 朋友们，你会对那些更容易、更方便的人这样做，比如我们的合作伙伴，所以这算是一种做法。
[00:08:58.420] I actively try to think about. Yeah definitely a good point whenever there's like gaps in my
[00:08:58.420] 我会积极思考。是的，这绝对是一个很好的观点，尤其是在我的思路出现空白的时候。
[00:09:04.820] schedule where I'm unable to fit in therapy for a while I notice the like trauma dumping on James
[00:09:04.820] 在我的日程安排中，有一段时间我无法抽出时间进行心理治疗，我注意到詹姆斯似乎在向我倾诉创伤。
[00:09:10.260] gets significantly worse and I'm always like maybe I should stop and book a therapy session
[00:09:10.260] 情况明显恶化，我总是想，也许我应该停下来，预约一次心理治疗。
[00:09:17.780] yeah that's true I think like therapy is a good tool here where you're able to bounce ideas off
[00:09:17.780] 是的，没错。我觉得心理咨询在这里是个不错的工具，可以让你和别人交流想法。
[00:09:24.660] of someone or just like thoughts and they can help you process. For me I think it helps to vocalize
[00:09:24.660] 无论是某人的想法，还是其他类似的想法，它们都能帮助你理清思路。对我来说，我觉得说出来很有帮助。
[00:09:30.820] my thoughts sometimes even if my therapist is just like cool like sounds great good thoughts
[00:09:30.820] 有时我的想法是，即使我的治疗师只是觉得“酷，听起来不错，好想法”，我也会这样想。
[00:09:37.460] but it's just like you say it out loud and then you hear yourself saying it sometimes
[00:09:37.460] 但就像你大声说出来，然后有时你会听到自己这么说一样。
[00:09:41.780] or they're there to like validate you and be like yeah I can see why you're feeling that way
[00:09:41.780] 或者他们是来肯定你的感受，说“是啊，我明白你为什么会有这种感觉”。
[00:09:47.220] and I think that relieves a lot of maybe like personal guilt or stress or any of those feelings
[00:09:47.220] 我认为这可以减轻很多人的内疚感、压力或其他类似的感受。
[00:09:55.540] attached to the worry of like oversharing with friends. Yeah definitely just having someone
[00:09:55.540] 担心跟朋友分享太多。是啊，肯定只是需要有人倾诉。
[00:10:02.100] validate your feelings that you feel sad or you feel upset about certain situation or circumstance
[00:10:02.100] 承认你对某种情况或环境感到悲伤或沮丧。
[00:10:08.980] makes you feel like you're being supported even if they have nothing no like suggestions or opinion
[00:10:08.980] 即使他们没有任何建议或意见，也会让你感觉受到了支持。
[00:10:14.820] solutions to solve your problem when someone says like oh yeah you can totally feel that way or I
[00:10:14.820] 当有人说“哦，是的，你完全可以有这种感觉”或者“我”时，如何解决你的问题？
[00:10:19.860] hear you that's very upsetting I would feel just as upset as you are it just feels good for someone
[00:10:19.860] 我能理解你的感受，这确实令人难过。如果我是你，我也会和你一样难过。对某些人来说，这种感觉真的很好。
[00:10:25.780] to like verbally validate you you're not doubting yourself or feeling this way. I completely agree
[00:10:25.780] 用言语确认你没有自我怀疑或有这种感觉。我完全同意。
[00:10:32.980] and I think you can kind of feel that self-doubt leak into like storytelling sometimes too right
[00:10:32.980] 我觉得有时候你也能感觉到，那种自我怀疑也会渗透到讲故事的过程中，对吧？
[00:10:38.340] oftentimes when I experience something and I'm like dude I can't believe that just happened to
[00:10:38.340] 很多时候，当我经历某些事情时，我会想：天哪，我简直不敢相信刚才发生了什么。
[00:10:42.180] me like what the f**k and I go to tell my friend about it I find myself using like weird language
[00:10:42.180] 我当时就懵了，心想这他妈到底是怎么回事，然后我跟朋友说起这件事，发现自己竟然用了些奇怪的语言。
[00:10:48.020] that kind of shields me from like oh you know maybe I'm crazy but blah blah blah like is that weird
[00:10:48.020] 那某种程度上保护了我，让我免于去想“哦，你知道吗，也许我疯了，但是……”之类的，这很奇怪吗？
[00:10:53.540] you know like constantly trying to seek that validation which is why I think when you're
[00:10:53.540] 你知道，就像不断地寻求那种认可，所以我觉得当你……
[00:10:58.740] getting it from a friend it just feels so good because then you're really able to unleash these
[00:10:58.740] 从朋友那里得到它感觉真的很好，因为那样你就能真正释放这些能量。
[00:11:03.460] emotions and these feelings that maybe you are kind of trying to evaluate were like normal or not
[00:11:03.460] 你或许正在试图判断，这些情绪和感受是否正常。
[00:11:08.900] so I think it's so valuable to be able to sit down with a friend and like talk to them without
[00:11:08.900] 所以我认为能够和朋友坐下来好好聊聊，而不用借助任何电子设备，是非常宝贵的。
[00:11:15.220] having to do all these weird negative self caveats. Dude that's why I really like the kind
[00:11:15.220] 不得不做这些奇怪的自我否定。老兄，这就是我喜欢这种风格的原因。
[00:11:20.980] of silly phrasing of being like oh just me or x whatever and then you know sometimes people are
[00:11:20.980] 用一些愚蠢的措辞，比如“哦，只有我”或者“x”之类的，然后你知道，有时候人们是
[00:11:29.300] like oh I totally feel you but then sometimes it's just silent but then it gets a good laugh out of
[00:11:29.300] 就像，哦，我完全理解你，但有时候却一片沉默，但随后却会让人开怀大笑。
[00:11:34.180] everyone and it turns what could have been a minor inconvenience into more of a light-hearted joke
[00:11:34.180] 大家都觉得这事儿挺有意思，原本可能只是件小事，结果却变成了一个轻松愉快的笑话。
[00:11:41.380] Agreed and I also try to be mindful of when a friend uses language like that so like
[00:11:41.380] 同意，我也会尽量留意朋友使用这类语言的情况。
[00:11:48.100] Crystal your example is like a little bit more light-hearted but I think sometimes when friends
[00:11:48.100] Crystal，你的例子比较轻松愉快，但我认为有时候朋友之间也会有这种感觉。
[00:11:52.020] talk about stories they're going through they like seriously are like questioning themselves right
[00:11:52.020] 他们会谈论自己正在经历的事情，他们好像真的在质疑自己，对吧？
[00:11:55.860] so that when I identify language like that I try to be even more validating like no you're like
[00:11:55.860] 所以当我听到类似的语言时，我会更加肯定地回应，比如“不，你就像……”
[00:12:02.980] completely right like you're completely valid even if it feels over the top sometimes I feel
[00:12:02.980] 你说的完全正确，你的观点完全合理，即使有时候感觉有点过头，我也觉得。
[00:12:08.420] like it's necessary. What if you were in a situation where you actually feel like your
[00:12:08.420] 好像这是必要的。如果你身处一种境地，你真的觉得……
[00:12:13.780] friend is not completely right like they're going through a situation they're having a tough time
[00:12:13.780] 朋友的说法并不完全正确，他们似乎正经历着某种困境，日子过得很艰难。
[00:12:18.180] and what they're telling you is a little questionable and you don't agree to them
[00:12:18.180] 他们说的话有点可疑，你也不认同。
[00:12:21.620] how would you support them though as a friend? Ooh that's tough I think in the moment like if
[00:12:21.620] 作为朋友，你会如何支持他们呢？哦，这很难说，我想如果……
[00:12:28.260] they're high emotions and you can tell I will try to agree in the best way possible without
[00:12:28.260] 他们的情绪很激动，你可以感觉到我会尽力以最好的方式表示同意，但不会……
[00:12:36.500] lying so maybe if they said something questionable I'll just kind of like brush over that part
[00:12:36.500] 撒谎，所以如果他们说了什么可疑的话，我可能就会一带而过。
[00:12:42.100] and be like that's like what I can think of off the top of my head. I think I would do the same
[00:12:42.100] 然后我就说，这是我能立刻想到的。我想我也会这么做。
[00:12:48.340] thing actually you would just try to brush off some questionable words that they're saying pretend
[00:12:48.340] 实际上，你会试图忽略他们说的一些可疑的话，假装没听见。
[00:12:52.420] you like you didn't hear it but you validate that they're not feeling good about the situation
[00:12:52.420] 你假装没听到，但你其实明白他们对这种情况感到不舒服。
[00:12:56.500] they're in you let them know that you're listening and then you kind of just don't offer too much
[00:12:56.500] 让他们知道你在听，然后你就不要提供太多信息。
[00:13:02.660] advice because you disagree with them then what advice are you going to offer them? Yeah that's
[00:13:02.660] 因为你不同意他们的观点就给他们建议，那你打算给他们什么建议呢？是啊，就是这样。
[00:13:07.540] fair. Dude this is such a funny question though because this is very tough right it's like I don't
[00:13:07.540] 公平。老兄，这个问题真有意思，因为这真的很难，对吧？我感觉自己好像不知道答案。
[00:13:13.220] want to validate certain things but I also want my friend to feel supported and I feel like when it's
[00:13:13.220] 我想肯定某些事情，但我也想让我的朋友感受到支持，我觉得当……
[00:13:19.380] like a live conversation whether you're face-to-face or like typing on messenger on the fly it's very
[00:13:19.380] 就像实时对话一样，无论是面对面还是像在即时通讯软件上快速打字，都非常
[00:13:24.660] hard to like find the perfect thing to say without letting the conversation die out you know like in
[00:13:24.660] 很难找到合适的措辞，既能保持对话的流畅性，又不至于让谈话冷场，你知道吗？
[00:13:30.340] person you don't want to just like sit there in silence and like nod forever you have to eventually
[00:13:30.340] 你不想让对方一直沉默地坐在那里点头，你最终还是得面对这种情况。
[00:13:34.500] say something so I find myself really struggling with this one. Maybe a good option is if it's not
[00:13:34.500] 说点什么吧，我发现自己真的很难回答这个问题。也许一个好办法是，如果不是的话。
[00:13:42.020] like super serious if they say something kind of unhinged you'd be like okay wait let's not do that
[00:13:42.020] 比如，如果他们说了什么有点语无伦次的话，你就会非常严肃地想：好吧，等等，我们还是别那样做吧。
[00:13:48.100] and then like try to redirect the conversation I feel like usually you know the tone of voice you
[00:13:48.100] 然后试着转移话题，我觉得通常你能感觉到你的语气。
[00:13:53.700] use while still you know showing that you've been supportive and going to continue to be supportive
[00:13:53.700] 趁你还了解情况的时候使用，表明你一直支持对方，并且会继续支持。
[00:13:59.060] that will kind of give a like comedic break in the midst of the conversation but I feel like that's
[00:13:59.060] 这会给对话带来一种喜剧效果，但我感觉那样……
[00:14:05.140] definitely like a read the room kind of situation can you crack that joke there or can do you just
[00:14:05.140] 绝对喜欢那种能察言观色的场合，你能在那儿讲个笑话吗？还是你只能……
[00:14:10.980] have to like let it go? Yeah I mean there's definitely no right or wrong answer it's just
[00:14:10.980] 必须放手吗？是啊，我的意思是，这肯定没有对错之分，就是这样。
[00:14:16.500] like I think it also depends on the person you're talking to and how they react to you disagreeing
[00:14:16.500] 我觉得这还取决于你和谁说话，以及他们对你的不同意见作何反应。
[00:14:22.660] with them but still trying to be supportive as a friend or it's the person who just needs you to
[00:14:22.660] 和他们在一起，但仍然试图以朋友的身份支持他们，或者只是那个人需要你……
[00:14:30.180] just listen and not provide any type of like verbal support but just like your presence then you can
[00:14:30.180] 只要倾听，不要提供任何言语上的支持，只要你的陪伴就好，这样你就可以……
[00:14:36.340] just be silent and not agree not have to agree with anything you disagree with but show them that
[00:14:36.340] 保持沉默，不要表示同意。你不必同意任何你不同意的事情，但要让他们明白这一点。
[00:14:42.580] you're still there and listening to them and yeah finding them comfort through the time right
[00:14:42.580] 你仍然在那里，倾听着他们，是的，在这段时间里从他们那里找到了慰藉，对吧？
[00:14:46.660] just depends on the person I feel like ultimately. Yeah I think that's pretty accurate yeah and I think
[00:14:46.660] 最终感觉还是取决于这个人。嗯，我觉得这很准确，而且我认为
[00:14:51.940] even when I think back on times that I've gone through and say I'm in some sort of crazy situation
[00:14:51.940] 即使回想起我经历过的那些时光，我也会觉得自己身处某种疯狂的境地。
[00:14:57.700] I have like this hot take that's mostly a bad take I've had friends just like sit there nod and be
[00:14:57.700] 我有个很犀利的观点，但其实大部分都是错的。我的朋友们听了之后就只是坐在那里点头附和。
[00:15:02.980] like yeah like you know and give like very general responses without necessarily validating what I'm
[00:15:02.980] 就像，你知道的，然后给出一些很笼统的回应，并没有真正认可我的观点。
[00:15:08.740] saying and I've also had friends say I don't know about that one like this one is a little bit weird
[00:15:08.740] 我也听朋友说过类似的话，他们觉得这个有点奇怪，不太确定。
[00:15:15.140] but I totally hear you on this other stuff and I think the way I received that kind of response
[00:15:15.140] 但我完全理解你说的其他方面，而且我觉得我收到那种回应的方式也挺好的。
[00:15:20.580] depended on my attitude at the time too like sometimes I'm more open to hearing someone disagree
[00:15:20.580] 这还取决于我当时的态度，比如有时候我更愿意听取不同的意见。
[00:15:25.220] with my takes but other times I might not be ready to hear that so I think it is totally a case by
[00:15:25.220] 我有时会接受我的看法，但有时我可能还没准备好听这些，所以我认为这完全取决于个案情况。
[00:15:30.980] case situation. Maybe another deflection you could say is we should think more on that or you know
[00:15:30.980] 情况就是这样。或许你可以换个说法，我们应该再多考虑一下这个问题，或者你知道的。
[00:15:37.380] something generic that's like not necessarily an agreement or disagreement but like at least
[00:15:37.380] 一些比较笼统的说法，不一定是同意或不同意，但至少……
[00:15:44.180] you're responding to them I guess. I feel like that can lead sort of like patronizing a little bit
[00:15:44.180] 我猜你是在回应他们。我觉得那样可能会显得有点居高临下。
[00:15:49.700] right it's like so hard to toe the balance because I think you can do it a funny way
[00:15:49.700] 对，这就像很难保持平衡，因为我觉得你可以用一种很奇怪的方式来做。
[00:15:53.700] then you can do it a serious way and then in between there's just like so many different
[00:15:53.700] 然后你可以认真地去做，而介于两者之间的还有很多其他方式。
[00:15:57.700] responses you can use it's really hard. Agree to disagree that response is a little weird
[00:15:57.700] 你可以用的回复是：这真的很难。求同存异吧，这种回复有点奇怪。
[00:16:05.220] Dude I feel like agree to disagree is it's valid right like the phrase itself is so valid but I'm
[00:16:05.220] 兄弟，我觉得“求同存异”这种做法挺合理的，这句话本身就很有道理，但我……
[00:16:12.580] like when is it ever appropriate to like use that phrase? Like how I just did it
[00:16:12.580] 什么时候用那个短语才合适呢？就像我刚才那样。
[00:16:21.140] Wait you know what I find hella funny is like maybe this is a more common occurrence in like
[00:16:21.140] 等等，你知道我觉得最搞笑的是什么吗？也许这种情况在其他地方更常见……
[00:16:25.780] group chats but when someone says something questionable amidst like a totally valid rant
[00:16:25.780] 群聊里，如果有人在一段完全合理的抱怨中说了些可疑的话，那就很尴尬了。
[00:16:30.100] and everyone like question mark reacts or like emoji reacts like the red question mark is just
[00:16:30.100] 每个人都喜欢问号表情，或者喜欢表情符号，比如红色的问号。
[00:16:37.060] so funny oh my god yeah that's a good one I think also like oh wait what?
[00:16:37.060] 太搞笑了，我的天哪，对啊，这个也挺好的，我觉得还有，等等，什么？
[00:16:42.340] What did you just say? We're just gonna gloss over that? Yeah the worst is when you say something
[00:16:42.340] 你刚才说什么？我们就这么略过吗？是啊，最糟糕的就是你说了什么
[00:16:48.740] and everyone thinks it's a hot take but no one reacts no response then you don't feel
[00:16:48.740] 大家都觉得这是个大胆的观点，但却没人回应，没人反应，那你也就没感觉了。
[00:16:53.300] that support that you're searching for speaking from personal experience
[00:16:53.300] 你所寻求的支持，来自个人经验的分享。
[00:16:58.420] I think also if you're close enough friends it's maybe more often that you're able to
[00:16:58.420] 我认为，如果朋友关系足够亲密，或许就能更频繁地……
[00:17:06.260] disagree a little or at least like call out hey that was a little weird that you just said that
[00:17:06.260] 稍微表示不同意，或者至少指出“嘿，你刚才那句话有点奇怪”。
[00:17:12.340] but of course like if it's someone who is a little less close to you then it's harder to like
[00:17:12.340] 当然，如果对方和你关系没那么亲近，那就更难喜欢了。
[00:17:17.700] directly call out these things even if it's like in a funny way this actually kind of reminds me
[00:17:17.700] 直接指出这些事情，即使是以一种滑稽的方式，这实际上也让我想起了……
[00:17:23.060] of something that my mom has always told me my whole life sometimes your friend is going through
[00:17:23.060] 我妈妈从小就一直跟我说，有时候你的朋友正在经历一些事情。
[00:17:28.660] something and then they have like a hot take but other times they're going through something and
[00:17:28.660] 有时候他们会发表一些独到的见解，但有时候他们也在经历一些事情，
[00:17:32.340] then maybe their attitude towards life is a little angry or they're being more snippy than usual or
[00:17:32.340] 那么，或许他们对生活的态度有点愤怒，或者比平时更尖刻。
[00:17:38.340] they're kind of essentially lashing out at others because of what circumstances they're going through
[00:17:38.340] 他们基本上是因为自身所处的境况而对他人发泄不满。
[00:17:43.700] and my mom has always said something like you know if your friend is suddenly acting like
[00:17:43.700] 我妈妈总是会说，你知道，如果你的朋友突然表现得像
[00:17:49.140] a little weird or maybe they're more emotional than usual or something in their attitude or
[00:17:49.140] 有点怪异，或者他们比平时更情绪化，或者他们的态度有什么变化。
[00:17:54.980] atmosphere is changing usually it's because they're going through something so just give them
[00:17:54.980] 气氛发生变化通常是因为他们正在经历某些事情，所以就顺其自然吧。
[00:18:00.580] grace and like give them patience and just try to understand your friend as they go through this
[00:18:00.580] 宽容一些，耐心一些，试着理解你的朋友正在经历的一切。
[00:18:05.380] like even if they're not explicitly coming to you and being like hey I have this problem
[00:18:05.380] 即使他们没有明确地来找你，说“嘿，我遇到了这个问题”
[00:18:09.300] I feel like that's so something you learn with experience you know like it's not an attitude
[00:18:09.300] 我觉得这完全是经验之谈，而不是一种态度。
[00:18:14.180] I could have imagined having in like my teenage years or something like that but I think it is
[00:18:14.180] 我原本以为会在青少年时期之类的时候拥有这样的经历，但我认为现在的情况是……
[00:18:18.580] very true oftentimes people have hot takes because maybe they're feeling emotional or like
[00:18:18.580] 确实如此，人们常常会发表一些激烈的观点，可能是因为他们情绪激动或者……
[00:18:23.060] they're feeling really upset so I think recognizing that too is a part of being
[00:18:23.060] 他们感到非常难过，所以我认为认识到这一点也是关怀的一部分。
[00:18:27.620] like a good and supportive friend wise words from your mom but I feel like that brings me to another
[00:18:27.620] 就像一位好朋友在背后支持你，就像妈妈说的那些充满智慧的话一样，但我觉得这又让我想到了另一件事。
[00:18:35.460] question which is if you can kind of tell that your friend is maybe going through something or
[00:18:35.460] 问题是，你是否能看出你的朋友可能正在经历某些事情？
[00:18:41.220] acting up a bit recently would you reach out to them and ask if they're doing okay for me it
[00:18:41.220] 最近他们有点反常，你能联系他们问问他们是否一切都好吗？
[00:18:48.020] depends on who the friend is because for example some people like me for instance sometimes I'm
[00:18:48.020] 这取决于朋友是谁，因为例如有些人，比如我，有时候我
[00:18:54.100] acting a little weird or I'm like going through something it's pretty obvious I'm like not in the
[00:18:54.100] 我的行为有点怪异，或者我好像遇到了什么事，很明显我状态不太好。
[00:18:58.340] mood I don't prefer it when people reach out in the really beginning unless I've processed it myself
[00:18:58.340] 心情：我不太喜欢别人在一开始就主动联系我，除非我自己已经消化了这件事。
[00:19:04.420] like I mentioned earlier and like kind of like understood the situation and what my next steps are
[00:19:04.420] 就像我之前提到的那样，我已经大致了解了情况以及下一步该怎么做。
[00:19:10.660] so if they'll reach out to me sometimes I just like won't respond because I don't really want
[00:19:10.660] 所以如果他们联系我，我有时就不会回应，因为我真的不想回应。
[00:19:14.660] to talk about it or I have nothing to say about it or I just don't need that comfort that my friend
[00:19:14.660] 谈论这件事，或者我对此无话可说，或者我只是不需要朋友的那种安慰。
[00:19:21.300] is offering so I think it depends on who or if it's like a friend I know that like when they're
[00:19:21.300] 有人提议，所以我觉得这取决于是谁，或者像我认识的朋友那样，当他们……
[00:19:27.140] going through things they like love the friendship they love like having a person there supporting
[00:19:27.140] 经历种种磨难，他们珍视友谊，喜欢有人在身边支持他们。
[00:19:31.460] them actively then obviously if I sent something off I would reach out to them yeah I feel like
[00:19:31.460] 如果他们主动联系我，那显然如果我寄了什么东西，我也会联系他们，是的，我觉得是这样。
[00:19:38.180] that approach makes a lot of sense like curating it to who your friend is but I find it really hard
[00:19:38.180] 这种方法很有道理，就像根据朋友来挑选内容一样，但我发现真的很难做到。
[00:19:43.460] to sometimes figure out like exactly what they want because even if it's the same person depending on
[00:19:43.460] 有时候甚至要弄清楚他们到底想要什么，因为即使是同一个人，也取决于……
[00:19:48.660] the time they might want something different but I think I tread a little bit more cautiously about
[00:19:48.660] 有时候他们可能想要不同的东西，但我认为我应该更加谨慎一些。
[00:19:53.780] reaching out and asking people if they're like going through it you know because I have done that
[00:19:53.780] 主动联系别人，问问他们是否也有类似的经历，因为我做过这件事。
[00:20:00.260] more often in the past and I feel like it's a really sensitive like thing to do I don't feel
[00:20:00.260] 过去更频繁地，我觉得这是一件非常敏感的事情，我感觉
[00:20:06.740] like I'm savvy enough to like navigate it properly so I feel like what I find works the best is to like
[00:20:06.740] 我觉得我足够精明，能够正确地驾驭它，所以我发现最好的方法就是喜欢
[00:20:13.140] be supportive in a different way so maybe like help them feel distracted and help them feel
[00:20:13.140] 换一种方式给予支持，比如帮助他们转移注意力，让他们感觉
[00:20:17.220] comfortable and like take them out to do things that I know they like and then maybe towards the
[00:20:17.220] 感觉舒适，喜欢带他们出去做他们喜欢的事情，然后也许会朝着……
[00:20:21.140] end of the day they'll feel more comfortable sharing I think I'm similar to you both where I
[00:20:21.140] 最终他们会更乐意分享。我觉得我和你们俩的情况差不多，我
[00:20:26.820] also err on the side of caution and probably not reach out just in case you know they're not the
[00:20:26.820] 谨慎起见，最好不要主动联系，以防万一你知道对方并非真心。
[00:20:32.980] type of person to want to be reached out to yeah I guess like kind of what you were saying earlier
[00:20:32.980] 嗯，我想，就像你刚才说的，是那种让人想主动联系的人。
[00:20:38.980] that nowadays a lot of our problems and issues have evolved they're not as simple as you know
[00:20:38.980] 如今，我们的许多问题和挑战都发生了变化，它们并不像你想象的那么简单。
[00:20:45.700] boy troubles back in the day so yeah sometimes like things that people are going through are
[00:20:45.700] 以前也遇到过感情问题，所以有时候人们经历的事情就是……
[00:20:51.380] really sensitive so it feels almost intrusive to prod a bit to be the person to reach out before
[00:20:51.380] 这个人非常敏感，所以主动去打扰他感觉几乎有点冒昧，但还是想成为主动联系他的人。
[00:20:57.780] they've shown that they're ready to be reached out to if that makes sense but yeah I think it
[00:20:57.780] 他们已经表明愿意接受联系，如果我这么说你能理解的话，是的，我觉得是这样。
[00:21:04.100] can definitely be case by case as well though like if you have a close friend that you're super
[00:21:04.100] 当然，具体情况具体分析也很重要，比如如果你有一个关系非常亲密的朋友，你超级……
[00:21:09.700] comfortable with and like you really know their habits and like the kind of way that they act
[00:21:09.700] 感觉自在，并且真正了解他们的习惯和行为方式。
[00:21:14.900] then maybe reaching out to them is the move if you know that it won't offend them or like
[00:21:14.900] 那么，如果你确定不会冒犯他们，或者不会让他们反感，那么主动联系他们或许是个好主意。
[00:21:20.500] set them off or anything of that sort and I think you can also do it in like a specific way too
[00:21:20.500] 引爆它们或者做类似的事情，而且我认为你也可以用某种特定的方式来做。
[00:21:26.580] I think reaching out and checking in on your friend is like a natural thing to want to do
[00:21:26.580] 我认为主动联系朋友、关心朋友是人之常情。
[00:21:30.180] but if your friend is not necessarily ready to open up and they give you like a very generic
[00:21:30.180] 但如果你的朋友还没准备好敞开心扉，而只是给你一些非常笼统的回答，那他们可能就比较被动了。
[00:21:34.740] answer like I'm doing fine like why do you ask then I think as a good friend you also can't be like
[00:21:34.740] 回答说我很好，那你为什么还要问？我觉得作为好朋友，你也不能这样。
[00:21:40.500] offended or feel put off by that too like you have to accept that maybe they're not ready to share
[00:21:40.500] 感到被冒犯或反感，好像不得不接受他们可能还没准备好分享的事实。
[00:21:44.820] maybe like a good alternative is you could just ask them like hey you want to catch up over like
[00:21:44.820] 或许一个不错的替代方案是，你可以直接问他们：“嘿，你想不想聊聊天？”
[00:21:50.500] boba or like quick lunch or something maybe during that like face-to-face conversation
[00:21:50.500] 珍珠奶茶或者像快餐之类的东西，也许可以在那种面对面的谈话中吃。
[00:21:56.900] they might start to feel more comfortable and like share with you if they're going through something
[00:21:56.900] 如果他们遇到了什么事，他们可能会开始感到更自在，也更愿意和你分享。
[00:22:01.780] I think even like if you hit them up for example you reach out but they're like oh no I'm fine
[00:22:01.780] 我觉得就算你主动联系他们，他们也会说“哦不，我没事”。
[00:22:07.300] even a oh I'm here if you want to talk or do you want to talk about it if not that's totally okay
[00:22:07.300] 即使只是简单地说一句“哦，我在这儿，如果你想聊聊的话”或者“你想聊聊吗？”，如果不想聊也没关系，
[00:22:12.020] it's like as easy as they can get when you reach out to someone but you're also respecting their
[00:22:12.020] 当你主动联系别人时，这就像是最简单直接的方式，同时你也尊重了对方。
[00:22:15.860] privacy and their own situations or whatever is going on kind of giving them the initiative
[00:22:15.860] 隐私以及他们自身的处境或其他任何情况，都赋予了他们主动权。
[00:22:23.220] to decide whether they want to open up or let you know that they're going through something but
[00:22:23.220] 决定他们是否愿意敞开心扉，或者是否想让你知道他们正在经历一些事情，但是
[00:22:28.420] they don't really want to talk about it now and I'm just kind of thinking about like how I myself
[00:22:28.420] 他们现在不太想谈这件事，而我只是在想我自己会怎么做。
[00:22:33.140] operate when I'm going through something or whatever as I kind of mentioned earlier when
[00:22:33.140] 正如我之前提到的，当我经历某些事情或其他什么事情时，我就会这么做。
[00:22:39.300] I'm ready I do reach out to friends sometimes and what I think is also interesting is I'll
[00:22:39.300] 我已经准备好了，我有时确实会联系朋友，而且我觉得有趣的是，我会
[00:22:45.780] sometimes try to reach out to friends who I know have gone through something similar because then
[00:22:45.780] 有时候我会试着联系那些有过类似经历的朋友，因为那样……
[00:22:51.380] I feel like if I'm looking for advice in particular they could potentially provide good advice
[00:22:51.380] 我觉得如果我特别想寻求建议，他们或许能提供一些有用的建议。
[00:22:58.980] otherwise I might just reach out to a friend to like have them listen and be like a comforting
[00:22:58.980] 否则我可能就会联系朋友，让他们听听我的想法，安慰我。
[00:23:05.860] support yeah actually thinking about it I do that same thing sometimes if you know a friend has like
[00:23:05.860] 支持，嗯，其实想想，有时候我也会这么做，如果你知道朋友有类似的事情
[00:23:11.860] gone through the same situation it's easier to like reach out to them and talk to them about it
[00:23:11.860] 经历过类似情况的人更容易主动联系他们，和他们谈谈这件事。
[00:23:17.540] versus like maybe the person you typically would go to because they might have solutions that maybe
[00:23:17.540] 而不是像你通常会去找的那种人，因为他们可能有一些解决方案。
[00:23:22.900] fit your situation well or just like things that like trial and error what they've done that didn't
[00:23:22.900] 是否适合你的情况，或者只是喜欢那种反复试验、不奏效的做法？
[00:23:29.220] work out so you kind of know like how to go forth yourself and it just feels a little more comforting
[00:23:29.220] 锻炼一下，你就能大概知道该如何独立前进，这会让你感觉更安心一些。
[00:23:34.020] to know that someone has been in the same situation as you and you're not the only one who has to go
[00:23:34.020] 知道有人和你处境相同，知道你不是唯一一个必须离开的人，这感觉真好。
[00:23:37.460] through like this tough time by yourself right and plus like it really depends on what is causing
[00:23:37.460] 独自度过这段艰难时期，对吧？而且，这真的取决于是什么原因造成的。
[00:23:44.020] the tough time but I feel like there are times where I'm like this problem that I'm dealing with
[00:23:44.020] 虽然这段时间很艰难，但我感觉有时候我会像这样面对这个问题。
[00:23:48.580] feels like slightly humiliating or like slightly embarrassing that I'm going through it and it
[00:23:48.580] 感觉有点羞辱，或者有点尴尬，因为我正在经历这些。
[00:23:53.140] might feel more like dirty laundry kind of an area of problem and I think that is probably another
[00:23:53.140] 这可能感觉更像是家丑外扬之类的问题，我认为这可能是另一个原因。
[00:24:01.700] thing that I would feel more sensitive about sharing like I might not go to everyone who I
[00:24:01.700] 有些事我可能不太愿意分享，比如我可能不会告诉所有人。
[00:24:05.540] usually go to and I'll want to keep it a little bit more private and contained for sure I also
[00:24:05.540] 我通常会去，而且我肯定希望保持一些私密性和控制性。
[00:24:11.220] actually thought of another thing on the topic of like reaching out to particular friends
[00:24:11.220] 关于主动联系特定朋友这个话题，我其实还想到了另一件事。
[00:24:15.700] I feel like Tiffy is actually a great example because I remember vaguely when post-college
[00:24:15.700] 我觉得蒂菲其实就是一个很好的例子，因为我隐约记得大学毕业后……
[00:24:22.420] Tiffy is like in nursing right but in our main friend group no one else is a nurse but Jisoo you
[00:24:22.420] Tiffy好像是学护理的，但是我们主要的朋友圈里除了Jisoo以外，没有其他人是护士。
[00:24:29.540] have like a couple nursing friends who you ended up referring Tiffy to and then they like chatted
[00:24:29.540] 你有几个当护士的朋友，你最后把蒂菲介绍给了她们，然后她们就聊了起来。
[00:24:35.460] about job searching and I think you guys ended up bonding a lot through that right Tiffy?
[00:24:35.460] 关于找工作这件事，我觉得你们俩因此建立了很深的友谊，对吧，蒂菲？
[00:24:40.660] Yeah actually yeah me and one of Jisoo's friend actually appeared on another podcast a while back
[00:24:40.660] 对啊，其实我和Jisoo的一个朋友之前确实一起上过另一个播客节目。
[00:24:46.740] ago but I connected with that friend through Jisoo because I was probably ranting to Jisoo about like
[00:24:46.740] 很久以前，我通过Jisoo认识了那个朋友，因为我当时可能在向Jisoo抱怨一些事情。
[00:24:51.940] having a hard time after college job applications and how tough the industry was and she like
[00:24:51.940] 大学毕业后求职申请很困难，她也深知这个行业的竞争有多激烈，她喜欢
[00:24:57.700] connected me to her friend who went through the same situation as me applying to like jobs in the
[00:24:57.700] 她把我介绍给了她的朋友，这位朋友和我一样，在申请类似的工作时也遇到了同样的情况。
[00:25:02.340] same area same hospitals and yeah it really helped me out a lot I did feel very supported at the time
[00:25:02.340] 同一地区，同一家医院，是的，它真的帮了我很多，当时我确实感到得到了很大的支持。
[00:25:09.060] yeah perfect example Crystal yeah so I feel like that's definitely another good like option to have
[00:25:09.060] 对，Crystal 就是个很好的例子。所以我觉得这绝对是另一个不错的选择。
[00:25:15.700] if you have someone to connect a friend to and like help them through certain issues that you
[00:25:15.700] 如果你有可以介绍朋友认识的人，并且愿意帮助他们解决某些问题，那么你
[00:25:21.860] know like you yourself are not totally equipped to help only of course if that other friend is like
[00:25:21.860] 你知道，就像你自己一样，你也不完全有能力提供帮助，当然，前提是那个朋友也像这样。
[00:25:27.140] looking for that kind of help yeah I feel like that's always kind of like the instinct too of
[00:25:27.140] 是的，我也在寻找那种帮助，我觉得这似乎也是一种本能。
[00:25:33.380] like how do I support this friend who is coming to me who is going through something but it's
[00:25:33.380] 我该如何支持这位前来寻求帮助的朋友，她正经历着一些事情，但是……
[00:25:38.420] also something that I find as such a double-edged sword because my go-to is always like oh how do I
[00:25:38.420] 这也让我觉得像把双刃剑，因为我的惯性思维总是会想：哦，我该怎么做？
[00:25:45.060] shower this friend with like advice and like set them up for success but sometimes they don't come
[00:25:45.060] 给这位朋友提供很多建议，帮助他们走向成功，但有时他们却不来。
[00:25:49.860] to you necessarily seeking that so how do you guys navigate avoiding saying certain taboos while still
[00:25:49.860] 你们未必真的在追求这个，那么你们是如何避免触犯某些禁忌的呢？
[00:25:55.620] helping your friend feel supported in the best way possible yeah this is actually something I still
[00:25:55.620] 尽最大可能帮助朋友感受到支持，是的，这确实是我仍然在做的事情。
[00:26:00.660] struggle with and I'm trying to get better every day but in the past I used to always tell my
[00:26:00.660] 我一直在努力克服这个问题，每天都在努力进步，但过去我总是告诉我的
[00:26:05.700] friends like oh don't worry oh don't worry about it oh don't worry it's fine because it's just like
[00:26:05.700] 朋友们会说：“哦，别担心，哦，别担心，哦，没事的。”因为这就像……
[00:26:10.900] first natural instinct for me to just try to make them feel better when they're upset so I just say
[00:26:10.900] 我的第一反应就是想办法让他们难过的时候感觉好一些，所以我就说
[00:26:17.780] don't worry without really thinking but I've gotten feedback from a friend before in the past
[00:26:17.780] 别没仔细想就担心，我以前也从朋友那里得到过类似的反馈。
[00:26:22.340] where she mentioned that like it really didn't feel encouraging at all when I said that and it
[00:26:22.340] 她提到这件事的时候，我这么说真的让我感觉一点也不鼓舞人心。
[00:26:27.620] felt like I was just saying it to say it and I didn't realize I had come off in that that way
[00:26:27.620] 感觉我只是为了说而说，并没有意识到我的语气会给人那种感觉。
[00:26:33.300] and like the number of times I might have come off like that way to other people by doing the
[00:26:33.300] 以及我可能因为做了某件事而在别人眼中留下那种印象的次数。
[00:26:37.060] same thing so that's something I actively try to avoid saying it's like the phrase like oh don't
[00:26:37.060] 是一样的道理，所以我尽量避免说这句话，就像“哦，别这样”这种说法一样。
[00:26:42.180] worry or it's okay just like very general things that you naturally say without thinking I try to
[00:26:42.180] 担心或者没关系，就像一些你自然而然脱口而出、不假思索的话一样，我试着……
[00:26:48.180] put more thought into it before saying that and sometimes I'll like catch myself almost saying
[00:26:48.180] 说话前要多想一想，有时候我会发现自己差点就说出口了。
[00:26:52.420] it and I'll kind of shut up real fast yeah kind of on a similar vein I think I tend to say stuff
[00:26:52.420] 我会很快闭嘴，嗯，差不多就是这个意思，我觉得我经常说一些话。
[00:26:59.460] like oh at least this didn't happen or at least you know you still have this you know along those
[00:26:59.460] 比如，哦，至少这件事没有发生，或者至少你知道你仍然拥有这些，你知道的，那些
[00:27:05.460] kinds of lines and when you really think about it it's like is this really helping the situation
[00:27:05.460] 各种各样的台词，当你仔细想想，就会发现这真的有助于解决问题吗？
[00:27:10.660] like it doesn't mean that the situation didn't happen even though it's like try to look on the
[00:27:10.660] 这并不意味着这件事没有发生过，即使你试图从另一个角度看待它。
[00:27:15.060] bright side what we're dealing with in the moment is like someone's feelings so that has definitely
[00:27:15.060] 好的一面是，我们目前处理的是某人的感受，所以这肯定有好处。
[00:27:21.060] been a phrase that I try to avoid but I mean same thing it's like it's so hard and I'm also actively
[00:27:21.060] 我一直尽量避免说这句话，但我的意思是，这真的很难，而且我也一直在积极地……
[00:27:28.900] working on it you just instinctively want to say all these things dude I totally relate to both of
[00:27:28.900] 做这件事的时候，你会不由自主地想说这些话，老兄，我完全能理解这两种感受。
[00:27:34.340] you I think it's because like at least when we were growing up the idea of like comforting a friend
[00:27:34.340] 我觉得是因为，至少在我们成长的过程中，安慰朋友这种想法并不普遍。
[00:27:39.140] was very much centered around like cheering them up I don't want my friend to be sad so how do I
[00:27:39.140] 一切都围绕着如何让他们开心起来，我不想让我的朋友难过，那我该怎么做呢？
[00:27:43.780] make them feel happy again but I feel like at least nowadays we know the importance of like
[00:27:43.780] 让他们再次感到快乐，但我觉得至少现在我们知道了喜欢的重要性。
[00:27:49.300] helping friends feel validated and supported and like heard so then I think it makes sense that
[00:27:49.300] 帮助朋友感到被认可、被支持和被倾听，所以我觉得这很有意义。
[00:27:54.740] we're like trying to unlearn the stuff from our childhood maybe but for me I think I'm cursed with
[00:27:54.740] 我们就像是在努力忘记童年时期学到的东西，但对我来说，我觉得我被诅咒了。
[00:28:01.940] two different maybe curses so the first maybe curse is the maybe you should or like maybe you
[00:28:01.940] 两种不同的“也许”诅咒，第一种是“也许你应该”或“也许你喜欢”之类的。
[00:28:07.860] should do this always trying to suggest something which the intention is good right it's like trying
[00:28:07.860] 应该总是这样做，试图提出一些出发点是好的建议，对吧？就像是试图……
[00:28:14.020] to help out in a way that I know of but I feel like for a lot of people that's like the last
[00:28:14.020] 尽我所能地提供帮助，但我觉得对很多人来说，这已经是最后一次了。
[00:28:19.300] thing that they want to hear and then my other maybe curse is maybe it's because and then I like
[00:28:19.300] 他们想听的，还有我另一个可能的原因，也许是因为，然后我喜欢
[00:28:25.540] go into the psychoanalysis which I feel like is also destructive because sometimes it can be like
[00:28:25.540] 去做精神分析，我觉得那也是一种破坏，因为有时候它会像……
[00:28:31.220] fun but for someone who's actively going through it I feel like the last thing you want to do is
[00:28:31.220] 虽然很有趣，但对于正在经历这一切的人来说，我觉得最不想做的就是……
[00:28:36.900] add even more avenues of overthinking to their plate so recently I was like I should probably
[00:28:36.900] 这无疑会让他们面临更多过度思考的途径，所以最近我心想，我大概也应该这么做吧。
[00:28:43.780] stop it like this is not productive for them or for me yeah those are good ones and I definitely
[00:28:43.780] 别这样，这样对他们和我都没好处。是的，这些都是好主意，我肯定
[00:28:49.620] struggle with the like maybe you should do this do that thing for sure one thing that kind of helped
[00:28:49.620] 纠结于是否应该这样做或那样做，肯定有一件事确实有帮助。
[00:28:55.300] me with that particular one is I tried to reflect on like what I would prefer in terms of supporting
[00:28:55.300] 就我个人而言，我试图思考在支持方面我更倾向于什么。
[00:29:04.180] behavior and since I'm the type to kind of think through things first and like process stuff
[00:29:04.180] 行为方面，因为我属于那种做事前会先思考一番、喜欢处理事情的人。
[00:29:10.580] honestly once I reach out to friends I've probably thought out most of these you know
[00:29:10.580] 说实话，一旦我联系了朋友，我可能已经想好了大部分问题，你知道的。
[00:29:15.540] potential avenues so when someone says that to me like oh maybe you should try this maybe you should
[00:29:15.540] 潜在的途径，所以当有人对我说，比如“哦，也许你应该试试这个，也许你应该……”的时候，我就会想到这些。
[00:29:20.420] do that in my mind I'm kind of like okay but I already thought about that so like I appreciate
[00:29:20.420] 我脑子里想的是，好吧，但我已经考虑过了，所以我很感激。
[00:29:26.020] the like effort here but like I've already thought about that and that's not what I'm looking for
[00:29:26.020] 我也想尝试一下，但我已经考虑过了，那不是我想要的。
[00:29:30.260] right now so kind of reflecting about that helped me I don't know I guess like find even more reason
[00:29:30.260] 现在回想起来，这件事似乎帮助我找到了更多理由。
[00:29:36.580] to not say these things but I mean it's still an active effort they definitely slip in there here
[00:29:36.580] 虽然不说这些，但我的意思是，他们仍然在积极努力，肯定会偷偷地把这些话塞进去。
[00:29:42.340] and there I know it's so hard to stop saying it I feel like another thing that I've had to learn
[00:29:42.340] 我知道要停止说这句话有多难，感觉就像是我必须学习的另一件事。
[00:29:48.580] which I don't think I fully learned yet but I'm trying is I think it's easy for me when a friend
[00:29:48.580] 我觉得我还没完全掌握，但我正在努力。我觉得如果有个朋友，对我来说就很容易了。
[00:29:54.580] starts to open up about tough times to think how can I be a supportive friend to this person
[00:29:54.580] 开始敞开心扉，倾诉艰难时刻，思考如何才能成为这个人的支持朋友。
[00:30:00.100] but I found that sometimes that puts too much emphasis on me and how I'm acting and maybe the
[00:30:00.100] 但我发现，有时候这会过分强调我自己以及我的行为方式，也许……
[00:30:04.980] question is more so how does this friend want to be supported which I feel like is more similar to
[00:30:04.980] 问题更确切地说是这位朋友希望得到怎样的支持，我觉得这更类似于……
[00:30:09.620] what Tiffy was kind of talking about earlier and even just like a simple switch of like the language
[00:30:09.620] 就像蒂菲之前说的，甚至只是简单地转换一下语言风格。
[00:30:15.540] the internal language that I'm using when I'm thinking through these situations might be able to
[00:30:15.540] 我在思考这些情况时使用的内部语言可能能够
[00:30:20.900] help me better support this friend versus like oh what should I a supportive friend be doing
[00:30:20.900] 如何更好地支持这位朋友，而不是像“作为一个支持朋友的人，我应该做些什么”这样思考：
[00:30:28.420] that's a good one actually because I feel like in the situation where I'm supporting a friend and
[00:30:28.420] 这确实是个好主意，因为我觉得在支持朋友的情况下，
[00:30:33.220] they're like spilling the tea on everything sometimes I'll sit there I'm listening but I want
[00:30:33.220] 他们就像什么事都要八卦一样，有时候我坐在那里听着，但我其实想要什么
[00:30:38.740] to show that I'm listening and it's kind of hard to like showcase to them how much you're trying to
[00:30:38.740] 为了表明我在听，但要向他们展示你有多么努力，这有点难。
[00:30:44.820] like be there for them so then you start thinking like how do I be a better friend or how do I look
[00:30:44.820] 比如，你要在他们身边，然后你就会开始思考，我怎样才能成为更好的朋友，或者我怎样才能看起来更好。
[00:30:51.140] like a more supportive friend or how do I show them I am actively listening and it becomes about
[00:30:51.140] 就像一个更支持我的朋友，或者我该如何向他们表明我在积极倾听，然后事情就变成了……
[00:30:56.340] me versus like me really just being there and wanting to be that support for them but it's hard
[00:30:56.340] 我和我想要陪伴在他们身边并给予他们支持的想法之间摇摆不定，但这很难。
[00:31:05.380] it's something that I feel like as humans and as adults or young adults it's something we need to
[00:31:05.380] 我觉得作为人类，作为成年人或年轻人，这是我们需要做的事情。
[00:31:11.700] actively practice and we will develop as we get older through time like no one is the best
[00:31:11.700] 积极练习，随着年龄增长，我们会不断进步，就像没有人是最好的一样。
[00:31:18.900] at comforting someone like it's hard to have that as a skill to really be that friend that
[00:31:18.900] 安慰别人就像是一种很难掌握的技能，要成为那种真正的朋友，就必须具备这种能力。
[00:31:24.580] people say like oh she really makes me feel heard or she makes me feel better it's hard
[00:31:24.580] 人们会说，哦，她真的让我感觉被倾听了，或者她让我感觉好多了，这很难。
[00:31:29.060] it's really hard agreed I feel like because everyone is so different in the way that they
[00:31:29.060] 确实很难，我同意，因为每个人看待事物的方式都截然不同。
[00:31:34.340] want to be comforted so it's like extremely hard to be you know the perfect comforter dude I keep
[00:31:34.340] 想要得到安慰，所以要成为完美的安慰者真的很难，你知道的，我一直都这样。
[00:31:41.860] thinking about like blankets because we were saying comforter I definitely thought about blankets
[00:31:41.860] 因为我们说的是被子，所以我当时就想到了毯子。
[00:31:48.420] but I think both of you guys bring up good points like even just based on this conversation there's
[00:31:48.420] 但我认为你们俩都提出了很好的观点，即使仅从这次对话来看，也有……
[00:31:56.500] so many different things that we've learned over the years through our friendships on how to be
[00:31:56.500] 多年来，我们通过友谊学到了很多关于如何为人处世的道理。
[00:32:01.540] a support to someone who's close to us it also makes me think like you know when I go to my
[00:32:01.540] 对身边亲近的人的支持，也让我想到，你知道，当我去我的
[00:32:07.060] friends and I'm like hey I've been really going through something or like I have this issue I
[00:32:07.060] 朋友们，我会说，嘿，我最近遇到了一些事，或者我遇到了这个问题……
[00:32:10.900] can't stop thinking about x y and z I'm not sitting there like evaluating their performance as a friend
[00:32:10.900] 我一直在想x、y和z，我不是坐在那里像朋友一样评价他们的表现。
[00:32:17.380] on a scale of like a to f right like I feel like at the end of the day anytime I have a conversation
[00:32:17.380] 如果用A到F的等级来衡量，我觉得就像一天结束时，每次我进行对话一样。
[00:32:22.180] with a close friend and I open up I walk away from that conversation feeling supported and
[00:32:22.180] 我和一位亲密的朋友敞开心扉，谈话结束后，我感到自己得到了支持。
[00:32:28.180] I think a lot of that is obviously because my friends are putting in the work and putting
[00:32:28.180] 我认为这很大程度上显然是因为我的朋友们付出了努力和心血。
[00:32:32.580] in the effort to try to be there for me in a way that's maybe catered to myself but I think a lot
[00:32:32.580] 他努力想以一种可能更符合我自身需求的方式来支持我，但我认为很多
[00:32:38.100] of it too is like even just having that conversation and even just the fact that you're a friend someone
[00:32:38.100] 其中也包括进行那次谈话，甚至仅仅是因为你是朋友这件事本身。
[00:32:44.100] is feeling comfortable enough to go to to have conversations like this means that you're a support
[00:32:44.100] 能够自在地进行这样的对话，意味着你是一个支持者。
[00:32:49.060] already so maybe at the end of the day like while we consider these things on how to be supportive
[00:32:49.060] 所以也许最终我们会考虑到如何提供支持。
[00:32:55.220] we don't necessarily have to feel too much pressure on being like the perfect friend right
[00:32:55.220] 我们没必要给自己太大压力，非得成为完美的朋友，对吧？
[00:33:00.900] and we've talked a lot about what you should maybe avoid when you're trying to show the support to
[00:33:00.900] 我们已经讨论了很多在试图表达支持时应该避免的事情
[00:33:05.780] friends do you all have any tips that have been working for you when you're trying to show support
[00:33:05.780] 朋友们，你们在表达支持的时候，有什么行之有效的小技巧吗？
[00:33:10.980] for your friends I guess I'll start I feel like reacting in a really exaggerated manner
[00:33:10.980] 我想我该先从你的朋友们开始，我感觉自己会以一种非常夸张的方式做出反应。
[00:33:18.180] of reflecting the emotion that they are showing me helps sometimes so maybe if the person is
[00:33:18.180] 有时候，反映他们表现出的情绪会有帮助，所以如果这个人是
[00:33:24.980] complaining like oh my god like this driver was so rude today and like cut me off I'd be like dude
[00:33:24.980] 抱怨的时候，比如“我的天哪，这个司机今天太没礼貌了，还突然变道别我”，我就会想“这人真没礼貌”。
[00:33:30.340] that sucks like I can't believe they cut you off so dangerously like oh my god that's you know so
[00:33:30.340] 太糟糕了，我简直不敢相信他们竟然这么危险地切断你的交通，我的天哪，你知道吗？
[00:33:36.020] angering and I feel like that can really validate them they're like oh my god yeah I told the story
[00:33:36.020] 这让我很生气，我觉得这真的能让他们感到被认可，他们会说，哦我的天哪，是的，我讲了这个故事。
[00:33:41.140] and this person is feeling the same like angry emotion that I am so I think that I have found to
[00:33:41.140] 这个人也和我一样感受到了愤怒的情绪，所以我认为我找到了……
[00:33:48.980] work well sometimes yeah that's actually a good one I've noticed that sometimes when I'm like
[00:33:48.980] 有时候确实挺管用的，嗯，这确实是个不错的说法，我注意到有时候当我……
[00:33:55.940] talking to Crystal and I'm like stressed about something she does that actually the exaggerated
[00:33:55.940] 跟克丽丝塔尔聊天，我因为她做的某件事感到压力很大，而这件事实际上有点夸张。
[00:34:00.580] support reaction because I can respond back like I know right it's so upsetting and she's like yeah
[00:34:00.580] 支持她的反应，因为我可以回应说，我知道，这太让人难过了，然后她会说，是啊。
[00:34:06.580] exactly and we just feels like very supportive because it feels like someone understands you
[00:34:06.580] 没错，我们感觉很受支持，因为感觉有人理解你。
[00:34:11.620] and like what I feel it's like normal what my what I'm feeling at the time it's like completely
[00:34:11.620] 我觉得这很正常，我当时的感觉就像完全正常一样。
[00:34:18.020] normal because she also thinks it's a ridiculous like thing that happened to me thanks for being a
[00:34:18.020] 很正常，因为她也觉得发生在我身上的事很荒谬，谢谢你。
[00:34:23.620] good friend that's true actually I think I've noticed that too and it's so validating and
[00:34:23.620] 好朋友，你说得对，其实我也注意到了，这让我感觉很受肯定。
[00:34:30.660] comforting because the energy levels are like the same so I don't feel like I'm burdening because
[00:34:30.660] 让人感到安慰的是，大家的精力水平都差不多，所以我不觉得自己在给别人添麻烦。
[00:34:36.020] Crystal matches the energy and I'm like oh my god nice like then you can almost conclude the emotion
[00:34:36.020] 水晶与能量相符，我当时就想，我的天哪，真棒，然后你几乎就能感受到那种情绪了。
[00:34:42.260] quicker because you're like oh I've fulfilled this entire emotion of anger or stress or whatever
[00:34:42.260] 速度更快，因为你会想，哦，我已经把愤怒、压力或其他什么情绪都释放出来了。
[00:34:47.700] yeah I think I've noticed it because I've definitely even seen myself where I react in a
[00:34:47.700] 是的，我想我已经注意到了，因为我甚至亲眼看到过自己的反应。
[00:34:54.340] more like calm way because you know typically I'm very like quiet or like monotonous almost
[00:34:54.340] 更像是平静的方式，因为你知道，我通常都很安静，或者说很单调。
[00:35:01.300] and then it just feels like not satisfying right for the other person
[00:35:01.300] 然后就感觉好像没能让对方满意。
[00:35:05.140] it's like oh this like didn't even affect her is it like even valid
[00:35:05.140] 就好像，哦，这件事根本没影响到她，这说法到底有没有道理？
[00:35:11.780] so I think one thing that I've realized is a good strategy lately is not necessarily something that
[00:35:11.780] 所以我觉得我最近意识到的一点是，好的策略并不一定是……
[00:35:16.820] I always remember to practice with my friends but it's something that my friend told me when I was
[00:35:16.820] 我总是记得和朋友们一起练习，但这是我朋友在我小时候告诉我的。
[00:35:23.540] venting about something I've been going through I was talking with my close friend telling her
[00:35:23.540] 我向一位好朋友倾诉了我最近的一些经历。
[00:35:27.540] about this tough time I've been experiencing and really the crux of the issue was that I was
[00:35:27.540] 关于我最近经历的这段艰难时期，问题的关键在于我……
[00:35:32.500] feeling all these emotions about a situation and I felt like they weren't valid emotions like I was
[00:35:32.500] 我对这件事产生了各种各样的情绪，但我感觉这些情绪并不像我之前那样合理。
[00:35:38.020] like I know it's crazy for me to feel this but I like feel all these things and then she essentially
[00:35:38.020] 我知道我有这种感觉很疯狂，但我就是有这种感觉，然后她基本上
[00:35:44.100] told me no it's not crazy for you to feel this and here's why I've experienced something similar or
[00:35:44.100] 他告诉我，你有这种感觉并不奇怪，原因如下，因为我也有过类似的经历。
[00:35:49.700] you know I know someone who has gone through something similar so don't feel like you're
[00:35:49.700] 我知道有人经历过类似的事情，所以别觉得自己很了不起。
[00:35:53.300] crazy and I think instead of trying to be like yeah this isn't rational and trying to like
[00:35:53.300] 太疯狂了，我觉得与其试图说“是啊，这不理性”，不如试着……
[00:36:00.500] intellectualize every single emotion that I had she told me that I should just be feeling and like
[00:36:00.500] 她告诉我，我应该用理性去分析我所有的情绪，而应该只是去感受和喜欢。
[00:36:05.460] consuming all of my feelings that way the moment can pass kind of quicker and it's also you know
[00:36:05.460] 把所有情绪都沉浸在这种状态里，可以让时间过得更快一些，而且你知道的。
[00:36:12.500] you're not trying to backtrack on things that your body is telling you or like that your heart
[00:36:12.500] 你并不是试图违背身体或心脏发出的信号。
[00:36:17.140] is telling you and I feel like it was just such a simple tip but I really felt like she understood me
[00:36:17.140] 她跟我说，我觉得这只是个很简单的建议，但我真的感觉她理解我。
[00:36:22.580] and that in itself was like everything you know it like felt like it took weeks off of my shoulders
[00:36:22.580] 而那本身就像是卸下了我肩上数周的重担，你知道吗？
[00:36:29.060] basically yeah I like that I could totally see how that can be very helpful and it kind of all
[00:36:29.060] 基本上，是的，我喜欢这一点，我完全能理解这会很有帮助，而且它几乎涵盖了所有方面。
[00:36:36.180] plays into what we were talking about earlier just like validating the person's emotions and feelings
[00:36:36.180] 这和我们之前讨论的内容很契合，就像认可一个人的情绪和感受一样。
[00:36:42.500] I think one way a friend has shown me a lot of support when I was going through a tough time
[00:36:42.500] 我认为，在我经历艰难时期时，一位朋友给予我的支持就是其中之一。
[00:36:46.980] was just letting me know that they were there with me I was pretty upset at whatever was going on
[00:36:46.980] 他们只是想让我知道他们和我在一起。当时我因为发生的事情感到非常难过。
[00:36:53.540] and I was just like spilling like I could not shut up I was just going on and on and on I was going
[00:36:53.540] 我当时就像脱口而出，根本停不下来，一直说个不停。
[00:36:58.820] in circles again and the one thing that she just said like out of nowhere just like just that felt
[00:36:58.820] 又回到了原地打转，她突然冒出的一句话，就像凭空冒出来的一样，就那样感觉……
[00:37:04.180] really comforting to me was like I'm here for you I'll always be here for you and it just feels like
[00:37:04.180] 让我感到最安慰的是，我说“我在这里陪着你，我会永远陪着你”，这种感觉就像……
[00:37:10.420] they don't have to have gone through the same situation they don't even really have to understand
[00:37:10.420] 他们不必经历过同样的处境，甚至不必真正理解。
[00:37:14.180] it but the fact that she says she's there for me and she's going to continue to be there for me
[00:37:14.180] 但她说她会一直支持我，而且会继续支持我，这一点让我很感动。
[00:37:19.620] just feels like someone's got your back no matter what and that also feels really good even if they
[00:37:19.620] 感觉就像无论发生什么，都有人支持你，这种感觉真的很好，即使他们
[00:37:25.220] can't understand the situation they'll never understand the situation or they'll never be
[00:37:25.220] 他们无法理解这种情况，他们永远也不会理解这种情况，或者他们永远不会……
[00:37:29.060] placed in that type of situation it just feels like you have the support whether it's like through
[00:37:29.060] 身处那种境地，你会感觉自己得到了支持，无论是通过什么方式。
[00:37:35.220] messenger or in person I feel like that's a very good line that has made me feel very comforted
[00:37:35.220] 无论是通过 Messenger 还是当面交谈，我都觉得这句话很好，让我感到非常安慰。
[00:37:42.580] I like that one I feel like it's also one of those things that's very simple but the strength of the
[00:37:42.580] 我喜欢那个，我觉得它也是那种非常简单但却很有力量的东西。
[00:37:48.820] message is there yeah and I think what you said too about sort of like the actions of your friend
[00:37:48.820] 是的，信息就在那里，而且我觉得你说的关于你朋友的行为也很有道理。
[00:37:54.820] just hearing you out on everything also reminds me that sometimes it's not even about the words
[00:37:54.820] 听你把所有事情都说出来，也让我意识到，有时候重要的根本不是言语。
[00:38:00.660] it's about whether you show up for your friends it's about how much you're there when your friend
[00:38:00.660] 关键在于你是否会在朋友需要的时候出现，关键在于当你的朋友需要你的时候，你会在场多少。
[00:38:05.220] needs them so not all of the weight is like in the exact vocabulary that we choose
[00:38:05.220] 需要它们，所以并非所有的权重都像我们选择的确切词汇那样。
[00:38:12.420] you know I actually had a thought here after we all shared things that we felt have been helpful
[00:38:12.420] 你知道吗，在我们分享了各自觉得有帮助的事情之后，我其实突然想到一个问题。
[00:38:18.500] to ourselves or to our friends and I think that we actually don't communicate that much
[00:38:18.500] 我们要么跟自己说，要么跟朋友说，我觉得我们其实交流并不多。
[00:38:25.540] about how we like to be supported and we did mention earlier in the episode that oftentimes
[00:38:25.540] 关于我们希望被如何支持，我们在本集前面也提到过，很多时候
[00:38:32.340] we'll go to our partners for that support and I realized that it's because we talk to our partners
[00:38:32.340] 我们会向合作伙伴寻求支持，我意识到这是因为我们与合作伙伴进行了沟通。
[00:38:37.380] about how we'd like to be supported and I mean like the only time where we talked about a friend
[00:38:37.380] 关于我们希望得到怎样的支持，我的意思是，那也是我们唯一一次谈到朋友。
[00:38:44.500] sharing how they like to be supported was Tiffy's friend who shared the feedback about like you know
[00:38:44.500] 蒂菲的朋友分享了她喜欢被支持的方式，并分享了关于“你知道的”之类的反馈。
[00:38:50.020] Ashley when you say don't worry it's like not as effective so maybe like the moral of the story
[00:38:50.020] 阿什利，你说别担心，好像效果不太好，所以也许这就是这个故事的寓意。
[00:38:55.220] here is we should try to normalize sharing like how we like to be supported with our friends
[00:38:55.220] 我们应该努力将分享常态化，就像我们希望被朋友支持一样。
[00:39:01.220] of course not during our like high emotion times but just like in our more regular like day-to-day
[00:39:01.220] 当然，不是在我们情绪高涨的时候，而是在我们更平常的日常生活中。
[00:39:06.740] lives and I feel like that could overall probably improve a lot of the support that we receive and
[00:39:06.740] 生活，我觉得这总体上可能会改善我们所获得的很多支持，
[00:39:12.980] give because then we have a better idea of like oh this friend likes to be supported this way
[00:39:12.980] 给予，因为这样我们就能更好地了解，比如，哦，这位朋友喜欢以这种方式被支持。
[00:39:17.860] that friend likes to be supported that way. That's a really good point actually. I think that also
[00:39:17.860] 那位朋友喜欢被这样支持。这确实是一个很好的观点。我也这么认为。
[00:39:24.580] reminds me of how the calibration work could also be done in a different way as well so like I think
[00:39:24.580] 这让我想到校准工作也可以用另一种方式完成，所以我觉得……
[00:39:31.620] one of the things that I've experienced is if I'm going through something and I need a specific type
[00:39:31.620] 我经历过的一件事是，如果我遇到某些事情，需要某种特定类型的
[00:39:38.180] of response right whether it's high emotional like matching energy or it's actual real advice or maybe
[00:39:38.180] 回应是否恰当，无论是情绪激动的回应（比如能量匹配），还是实际的建议，或者其他什么。
[00:39:45.060] it's someone who can give me firm words or you know etc etc like I feel like I cater who I go to
[00:39:45.060] 这个人能给我一些明确的建议，或者你知道的等等等等，我觉得我得根据我找的人来决定去找谁。
[00:39:51.220] and who I share the story with based on what kind of response that might help me the most as well
[00:39:51.220] 以及我根据哪种回应最能帮助我来决定与谁分享这个故事。
[00:39:56.820] so then I think like you said open communication with your friends about like you know I think I
[00:39:56.820] 所以我觉得就像你说的，要和朋友们坦诚交流，比如，你知道，我觉得我
[00:40:00.980] prefer this kind of response more could also work and I think additionally just knowing that maybe
[00:40:00.980] 我更喜欢这种回应，这或许也行得通，而且我觉得知道这一点也挺好的。
[00:40:07.540] your friend is coming to you for a specific response too might help alleviate the pressure
[00:40:07.540] 你的朋友也想从你这里得到具体的答复，这或许能帮助缓解他的压力。
[00:40:11.700] a bit as well for sure and I'm really glad we spent time today to talk about this topic. I think
[00:40:11.700] 当然也有一点，我很高兴我们今天花时间讨论了这个话题。我认为
[00:40:18.980] we kind of don't talk about it enough maybe and everyone goes through tough times as we said
[00:40:18.980] 或许我们在这方面谈论得不够多，而且正如我们所说，每个人都会经历艰难时期。
[00:40:24.740] so it's always nice to know that you know our friends are there and we can try to be our best
[00:40:24.740] 所以，知道朋友们都在那里总是令人欣慰的，这样我们才能尽力做到最好。
