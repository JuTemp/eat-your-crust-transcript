[00:00:00.110] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Eileen. And I'm Harpreet. All right, so this week we thought it would be fun to talk about bringing your A-Game to social events and kind of setting the vibe for these social events.
[00:00:00.110] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Eileen。我是Harpreet。好的，这周我们想聊聊如何在社交场合中展现最佳状态，以及如何营造社交氛围。
[00:00:29.560] I feel like at least my year has been very busy and it's been a constant barrage of social events. So I've been thinking about this a lot. We thought we would bring in a couple of our friends who are great vibesetters to talk about this topic. So to start off, let's just kind of talk about what you would consider you on your A-Game. How would you describe that? Well, first off, it's a compliment that you think we're vibesetters.
[00:00:29.560] 我觉得至少我这一年都非常忙碌，社交活动接踵而至。所以我一直在思考这个问题。我们决定邀请几位很会活跃气氛的朋友来聊聊这个话题。首先，我们先来聊聊你觉得你状态最佳的时候是什么样的？你会怎么形容呢？首先，你觉得我们很会活跃气氛，这真是莫大的赞美。
[00:00:59.420] I feel like bringing my A-Game, I think it means, well, one, I feel like I feel good myself. I feel well-fed, well-rested. I feel comfortable with the people that are going to this event. If I feel good about the celebration, like the purpose that we're coming together for, I think that helps me feel more excited or look forward to the event. I think my A-Game is more around like how I'm feeling for the event.
[00:00:59.420] 我觉得要拿出最佳状态，首先，我得感觉自己状态很好。我吃得饱，休息得也好。我对参加这次活动的人都很熟悉，感觉很自在。如果我对这次庆祝活动，对我们齐聚一堂的意义感到满意，我想这会让我更加兴奋，更加期待这次活动。我觉得我的最佳状态很大程度上取决于我对这次活动的感觉。
[00:01:27.600] And most of those things, I also would want to be the same. But then something I was thinking about before this, I think I'm at my best when I'm not the host, I would say. I think playing host is sort of difficult when trying to be on my A-Game because I think I naturally just get nervous. I don't normally think I'm a perfectionist for those types of things, but I think I get very worried when I'm hosting to make sure everyone's having a good time. So on top of being well-fed, hydrated and all that stuff, if I happen to not be hosting, then I think that's always a good plus too.
[00:01:27.600] 而且大多数事情，我也希望如此。不过，我之前一直在想，我觉得我状态最好的时候反而是不用当主人的时候。我觉得当主人的时候很难做到尽善尽美，因为我天生就会紧张。我平时并不觉得自己是个完美主义者，但当主人的时候，我会特别担心，生怕别人玩得不开心。所以，除了吃好喝好之外，如果我不用当主人，那当然也是件好事。
[00:01:58.020] Interesting. Wait, Harpreet, you're hosts for a lot of events. We host like two a year. I can relate to that, though. I think I care a lot about how people are feeling or doing and that people are, you know, talking to each other. They're like comfortable in my space. So as a host, I often get more stressed than if I were just there enjoying the event. That's such a good one. I didn't even think about that. But now that you've brought it up, I'm like, yeah, host is like a different mindset.
[00:01:58.020] 有意思。等等，哈普里特，你们主持过很多活动啊。我们一年也就主持两次。不过我能理解你的感受。我觉得我很在意大家的感受和状态，也希望大家能互相交流，让他们在我的空间里感到自在。所以作为主持人，我常常比只是去享受活动时压力更大。你说的太对了，我之前都没想过这一点。不过你这么一说，我才意识到，主持活动确实需要不同的心态。
[00:02:26.920] So true. And I feel like setting can also kind of change your vibe sometimes. Like, do you think you guys tend to feel more comfortable at an indoors event, like at someone's house, for example? Or do you feel more free and ready to socialize at an outdoor event, maybe a festival or at a park or something? I definitely prefer more indoor. Hosted at someone's house, I think, is my preferred, which is funny because I think of like Harpreet's.
[00:02:26.920] 确实如此。我觉得环境有时也会影响你的氛围。比如，你们觉得你们是不是更喜欢室内活动，比如在别人家里？还是更喜欢户外活动，比如音乐节、公园之类的，这样你们会更自在、更乐于社交？我个人更喜欢室内。我觉得在别人家里办的活动是我最喜欢的，这有点搞笑，因为我首先想到的就是哈普里特家。
[00:02:55.020] I think because it's more intimate when it's at someone's house. So more often than not, I know the people at like a house event or a friend's house. And so I feel like I can be a lot more comfortable in that type of setting. If we were to go to a festival, many things are out of my control. There's a lot more crowds. The schedule or like the event is not in my control. So I feel a lot more comfortable, I think, going to someone's house. It's exactly who I want it to be.
[00:02:55.020] 我觉得是因为在别人家里聚会更私密。所以通常情况下，参加家庭聚会或者去朋友家聚会的人我都认识。因此，我觉得在这种环境下我会更自在。如果去音乐节，很多事情我都无法控制。人多得多。活动流程什么的也不在我的掌控之中。所以我觉得去别人家里聚会更舒服。那正是我想要的。
[00:03:25.100] It's like everybody I know, then I think I like an indoor event if I'm feeling really, really good too. But I think if I'm feeling a little out of it that day or anxious, then I don't mind an outdoor event. I do find that if I go to like a kickback or housewarming where I don't know as many people, I will find a corner to go to. And I will grab the like two, three people I know and drag them into that corner if I'm not super in it. That's funny you say that because there's actually an event where I remember you and Stanley and Serena were like in the corner.
[00:03:25.100] 就像我认识的所有人一样，如果我状态特别好，我也会喜欢室内活动。但如果那天我感觉有点不在状态或者焦虑，那我也不介意参加户外活动。我发现，如果我去参加那种不太熟悉的聚会或者乔迁派对，我会找个角落躲起来。如果我状态不太好，我会拉着两三个认识的人一起躲到那个角落。你说得真巧，因为我记得确实有一次，你、斯坦利还有塞雷娜也躲在角落里。
[00:03:55.080] And I was like, yes, they're comfortable there. You've seen it live. What about you guys? I have a setting that I absolutely hate, which is clubs. Clubs. I'm like super anti-clubbing. Actually, the whole time I lived in New York, I was like, don't even think of me if the word club is about to come out of your mouth. What is your like favorite type of setting? Probably something with an easy escape plan.
[00:03:55.080] 我当时就想，是啊，他们在那儿很自在。你亲眼见过。你们呢？我最讨厌的就是夜店。夜店。我超级反感去夜店。其实，我在纽约住的那段时间，只要你嘴里冒出“夜店”这个词，就别想跟我说话。你们最喜欢什么样的场合？大概是那种容易脱身的地方吧。
[00:04:27.300] So maybe, yeah, like someone's house. I feel like someone's house is also just the goaded setting because the bathroom access is so easy. And that honestly plays a big part into my comfortability. Do I feel at ease here? Is there a bathroom nearby? Just the thought of having to wade through a crowd and then like stuff myself into a porta potty just makes me immediately uncomfortable and anxious. Okay, what if it's like a more low stakes outdoor event, like hanging out at a park?
[00:04:27.300] 所以，也许吧，比如去别人家。我觉得去别人家也是个不错的选择，因为上厕所太方便了。说实话，这对我来说很重要。我在这里会感到自在吗？附近有厕所吗？光是想到要挤过人群，然后挤进移动厕所，就让我立刻感到不舒服和焦虑。好吧，如果是那种风险较低的户外活动呢，比如在公园里闲逛？
[00:04:57.080] I am not like a huge park person. I think if we were at somewhere like a restaurant or like a bar, then it would feel pretty chill. But at the end of the day, I think I just like being squished into someone's couch and like playing games at home rather than paying a lot of money for drinks or trying to socialize while we're like clinking forks and stuff over our dinner plates. I think one issue with parks is if it's too sunny, that literally drains my energy. Same.
[00:04:57.080] 我其实不太喜欢去公园。我觉得如果是在餐厅或者酒吧之类的地方，应该会感觉很放松。但说到底，我还是更喜欢窝在沙发里玩游戏，而不是花很多钱去酒吧喝酒或者在餐桌上碰杯聊天。我觉得公园的一个问题是，如果阳光太强，真的会让我感觉精疲力竭。我也是。
[00:05:27.880] Yeah, the sun makes me sleepy. So I feel like I would just want to lay there and not socialize as much. It'll get to me afterwards. But when I'm in the sun in those exact moments, I'm photosynthesizing hard. Her pizza plant. I go for my hot girl walks. I do whatever the sun's out here. I think overall parks are not bad as long as we can get some shade in there because that's just an outdoor home.
[00:05:27.880] 是啊，太阳晒得我犯困。所以我感觉只想躺在那儿，不想怎么跟人交流。之后肯定会觉得累。但当我沐浴在阳光下的时候，我的身体正在努力进行光合作用。就像她的披萨植物一样。我会去散步。只要阳光充足，我就会做任何事。我觉得公园总体来说还不错，只要能找到一些阴凉的地方，因为那就像一个户外的家。
[00:05:56.760] Why the club hate out of curiosity? Oh, I feel like it's just too crowded, too loud, too noisy. Bathroom lines suck. Yeah, I don't know. Everyone's just like super crowded and like dancing in your face and you're like, I just want to go home. You don't want to yell in someone's ear to get to know them? No, no. You don't want to bond with other girls in the bathroom? The club bathroom?
[00:05:56.760] 出于好奇，你为什么讨厌夜店？哦，我觉得那里太拥挤、太吵闹、太嘈杂了。上厕所排队也太烦人了。是啊，我也不知道。每个人都挤在一起，在你面前跳舞，你只想回家。你不想在别人耳边大声喊叫来认识他们吗？不，不。你不想在厕所里和其他女生交流吗？夜店的厕所？
[00:06:23.600] Those are the like one or two bright spots, but there's like 10 other negative spots, you know? I feel like the club is kind of a setting where there's like a really high ceiling. Like at its peak, clubbing is hella fun. But the floor is really low and to reach that ceiling level is pretty uncommon. So I can see how it can be like a hit or miss setting. The music is really important for the club.
[00:06:23.600] 那算是仅有的几个亮点，但还有十几个缺点，你知道吗？我觉得夜店就像一个天花板很高的地方。巅峰时期，夜店狂欢真的超级爽。但实际体验却很差，要达到那种巅峰状态其实并不常见。所以我能理解为什么夜店的体验会好坏参半。音乐对夜店来说真的非常重要。
[00:06:48.380] I've had good experiences at the club where the music is like R&B, hip hop, you know, music that I would dance to. But if it's not that case, then I absolutely don't like that experience. I feel like there's another factor here that we didn't touch upon yet, which is how often you're going to social events.
[00:06:48.380] 我在播放R&B、嘻哈之类的音乐的俱乐部有过很棒的体验，你知道，就是那种我会跳舞的音乐。但如果不是这种情况，那我就绝对不喜欢那种体验。我觉得这里还有一个我们还没提到的因素，那就是你参加社交活动的频率。
[00:07:07.020] And I think this can also be a factor that can be hit or miss, because if you're constantly going to social events all the time, maybe you feel more socially lubricated, ready to chat with other people and you're kind of staying at your A game. But at the same time, I think when many social events are back to back, you might start feeling overwhelmed. You might find yourself repeating the same story over and over to like 40 different people. So where do you think your sweet spot is?
[00:07:07.020] 我认为这也是一个可能有利也可能不利的因素，因为如果你经常参加社交活动，你可能会感觉自己更善于社交，更容易与人交谈，并且能保持最佳状态。但同时，如果社交活动接踵而至，你可能会感到不堪重负。你可能会发现自己一遍又一遍地向大约40个不同的人重复讲述同一个故事。那么，你认为你的最佳状态是什么呢？
[00:07:34.360] Oh, it depends on the type of event. So like most recently, the events we've been going to are weddings, birthday parties. And I think my most favorite is actually like the casual game night. So like very intimate, small gatherings. I could do game nights more often. I think we do it like every other week, pretty frequently. And I'm OK with that type of social setting.
[00:07:34.360] 哦，这要看是什么类型的活动。最近我们参加的活动主要是婚礼和生日派对。不过，我最喜欢的其实是那种轻松的游戏之夜，就是那种很私密的、小型的聚会。我倒是可以更频繁地参加游戏之夜。我们大概每隔一周就会举办一次，频率还挺高的。我很喜欢这种社交氛围。
[00:07:59.640] But I think those are specifically with friends that I don't have to stress about. It's really easy to hang out with them. I don't have to worry about meeting people for the first time. And if I do, then it's pretty easy. For weddings, I'm cool with frequent weddings. I think this year we've gone to like three weddings so far. So it's a lot of weddings. But I actually really enjoy weddings because I think it's a kind of a little reunion with our friends. So it ends up being it's a really exciting event. So I'm OK with those being frequent.
[00:07:59.640] 但我觉得这些聚会都是和那些让我不用操心的朋友一起度过的。和他们相处真的很轻松。我不用担心第一次见面会是什么感觉。就算真的要见面，也很容易。至于婚礼，我倒是不介意经常参加。今年到目前为止我们已经参加了三场婚礼了。所以婚礼确实不少。但我其实很喜欢婚礼，因为我觉得这就像是和朋友们的一次小聚会。所以最终会变成一件非常令人兴奋的事情。因此，我并不介意经常参加婚礼。
[00:08:27.380] I think in terms of festivals, maybe once once a year, though, or twice a year. And that's kind of my limit because that takes a lot out of me. So it really depends. Yeah, I would I would agree. I think it's definitely company dependent. If it's people I'm super comfortable with, I can probably do something social a few times a week. For example, like some of us went to Outside Lands recently and that three day event just like took it out of me. Like I was just like for the whole week, I was just like, I can't do anything. I can't do anything the next weekend.
[00:08:27.380] 我觉得就音乐节而言，一年一两次吧。这差不多是我的极限了，因为真的太耗费精力了。所以这真的要看情况。嗯，我同意。我觉得这肯定取决于和谁一起。如果是和特别熟的人，我可能一周可以参加几次社交活动。比如，我们最近去了Outside Lands音乐节，那三天活动真的把我累坏了。我感觉整整一周，什么都做不了。接下来的周末也什么都做不了。
[00:08:56.380] I just have to like lay in bed and rock. And I even messed that up. And there's like a day in between where I end up going drinking. And I was like, why did I do that? But yeah, I think like the casual, like low stakes people, you know, I can do that quite often. I think the only times that I have an exception with that is like, oh, it works like really shitty that week. And I'm like, oh, this is just going to add stress to my life rather than, you know, helping me out. Then in that case, I think I would I would say not as often.
[00:08:56.380] 我只想躺在床上摇摇晃晃。结果连这都做不到。中间还隔着一天，我最后还是去喝酒了。然后我就想，我为什么要这么做？不过，我觉得对于那种轻松随意、没什么压力的人，我可以经常这么做。我觉得只有一种例外情况，比如，哦，那周真的糟透了。我会想，哦，这只会给我的生活增加压力，而不是帮到我。在这种情况下，我想我就不会那么频繁地这么做了。
[00:09:25.680] But usually, yeah, good company, familiar company, low stakes events I can do pretty, pretty often. Dang, I feel like my ideal is maybe just hang out like once a month. Chris was like, don't talk to me. But I think I can agree when it's like a more intimate, just like close friends thing. That is definitely manageable. And I can do that more often.
[00:09:25.680] 但通常来说，是的，和好朋友、熟悉的朋友，参加一些无关紧要的活动，我可以经常参加。哎，我觉得我理想的聚会大概一个月一次吧。克里斯说，别跟我说话。但我觉得如果是那种更亲密、像好朋友一样的聚会，我可以同意。那种聚会绝对没问题，而且我可以更频繁地参加。
[00:09:52.860] But I think what really matters to me is if we're drinking or not, because if we're drinking every weekend, I will just be sad. But if it's like, you know, we're having dinner or lunch together or just having like a casual hangout, then I think that is way easier. I just feel like now the recovery after drinking is so rough.
[00:09:52.860] 但我觉得真正重要的是我们是否喝酒，因为如果我们每个周末都喝酒，我会很难过。但如果只是像我们一起吃顿饭或午饭，或者只是随便聚聚，我觉得那就容易多了。我感觉现在喝酒后的恢复期太难熬了。
[00:10:19.880] Even if I'm not necessarily hungover, I'm just so low energy. I need a day or two to lie in bed doing nothing. So yeah, I feel like it's hard to understand what cadence of hangout I need to be on my A game. I think sometimes there have been winter holidays or something where everyone's traveling and we're all busy and we don't get to see each other where I'm like fiending for that social hangout.
[00:10:19.880] 就算我没宿醉，也感觉特别没精神。我需要一两天时间躺在床上什么都不做。所以，我很难把握自己需要多久聚会一次才能保持最佳状态。有时候是寒假之类的，大家都在旅行，都很忙，没时间见面，那时候我就特别渴望和朋友们聚聚。
[00:10:47.700] But there are also times where I'm like hanging out all the time. I just get so drained. So I don't know where that balance lies, but all I know is that it can't be on one extreme or another. Like it has to feel balanced and the upkeep of these social events can't be too high. So for weddings, for example, I feel like I need a week of alone time after a wedding, especially if I'm heavily involved in it to kind of recover socially.
[00:10:47.700] 但有时候我又会整天泡在人群里，感觉筋疲力尽。所以我不知道该如何把握平衡，但我知道不能走极端。必须保持平衡，而且这些社交活动的开销也不能太大。比如，参加完婚礼后，我感觉需要一周的独处时间，尤其是如果我深度参与其中，才能从社交生活中恢复过来。
[00:11:15.620] But if it's a casual wedding where I'm just a guest, then it could feel more like an easy enhancement to my week and not the sole commitment of that week. How long did it take you to recover from your own wedding? Oh, it took a little bit. I think I had some family obligations afterwards. So it's not to like show up and, you know, smile and everything. But with friend hangouts and whatnot, I think the ideal recovery would have been like a week still.
[00:11:15.620] 但如果只是个比较随意的婚礼，我只是个宾客，那它对我来说就更像是一周的轻松小插曲，而不是那一周唯一的重担。你自己的婚礼之后花了多久才缓过来？哦，确实花了一段时间。我觉得之后我还有些家庭事务要处理。所以没办法像那样，到场后就立刻笑容满面。不过，如果能和朋友们聚聚什么的，我觉得理想的恢复时间大概还是一周左右吧。
[00:11:46.180] Dang. Okay. Yeah. I feel like being a bride or groom, that's a big social event. You're like the attention is all on you sometimes for like multiple days. Yeah. I do feel like the drinking is one thing, depending on how often that's happening. And then I also think like a number of people is a big factor for me. I think there is a threshold past like even if it's everybody I know, maybe at a certain point, I'm like, all right. If it's just like two or three people, I can do that constantly.
[00:11:46.180] 哎呀。好吧。是啊。我觉得当新娘或新郎，那可是件大事。有时候，好几天，所有人的目光都会集中在你身上。嗯。我觉得喝酒是一方面，这取决于喝酒的频率。而且我觉得人数也是个重要因素。我觉得有个临界点，就算都是我认识的人，到了某个时候，我也会觉得，好吧。但如果只有两三个人，我就可以一直喝下去。
[00:12:15.940] One person is like super easy for me. If it's like coffee, whatever, like those types of hangouts, I feel nothing afterwards. Usually I feel just energized. I feel nothing afterwards. I feel dead inside afterwards. Nothing in terms of exhaustion. Interesting. Sometimes one-on-ones actually exhaust me more. Well, it depends on like the person, but like one-on-ones sometimes like it's just you two. I don't know.
[00:12:15.940] 一个人跟我相处简直太轻松了。如果是喝咖啡什么的，那种小聚会之类的，之后我什么感觉都没有。通常我会觉得精力充沛。之后就什么感觉都没有了。感觉内心空虚。不是那种疲惫感。有意思。有时候一对一的相处反而会让我更累。嗯，这取决于对象，但有时候一对一的相处，就像只有你们两个人一样。我也不知道为什么。
[00:12:45.320] I feel like I get a little bit more tired versus like if I were in a group setting, I can like sometimes kind of fade into the background and let other people interact. And I can just like rest a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. If it's like a one-on-one with someone who you're just starting to get closer to or like just meeting, I feel like by the end, my like brain is swollen. My eyes are like so tired. Like I'm like, what did we even talk about? Yeah.
[00:12:45.320] 我觉得如果是在群体场合，我会更容易感到疲惫。在群体场合，我有时可以稍微放松一下，让其他人参与互动，自己休息一会儿。嗯，嗯，我觉得很有道理。如果是和刚开始熟悉或者刚认识的人一对一聊天，到最后，我感觉大脑都肿胀了，眼睛也特别累。我甚至会想，我们刚才到底聊了些什么？嗯。
[00:13:11.620] Otherwise with someone who you know really well, you can just sit in silence sometimes too, or just like each disassociate next to each other. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Cause it's one-on-one for someone you're meeting kind of for the first time or like the first few times your brain is trying to come up with questions. You're trying to like have a good conversation. So I feel like there's more work involved than if you're just like chilling on the couch with a friend. Yeah.
[00:13:11.620] 不然的话，如果是跟很熟的人，有时候也可以就这么静静地待着，或者各自保持距离，各自独处一会儿。是啊，没错。因为如果是跟初次见面或者头几次见面的人一对一聊天，你的大脑会努力想出一些问题，努力想好好聊聊。所以我觉得这比跟朋友在沙发上放松聊天要费劲得多。是啊。
[00:13:37.080] I think there's definitely a variability in the level of engagement because sometimes even at like a big house party where there's a lot of people, you could just like start playing video games on the couch, you know, grab your friend and talk in a corner or something. But yeah, on like a one-on-one level, I've been in like one-on-one situations where you go into like a really deep conversation and it takes like every brain cell to be fired up to like give that conversation the attention that it deserves. So I think it can be kind of a toss up.
[00:13:37.080] 我觉得参与度肯定是有差异的，因为有时候即使是在人很多的大型家庭聚会上，你也可能只是窝在沙发上玩电子游戏，或者拉着朋友找个角落聊聊天什么的。但是，如果是一对一的交流，我经历过那种需要全神贯注、深入探讨的对话，那种对话需要你调动所有脑细胞才能认真对待。所以我觉得这很难说。
[00:14:05.960] So I actually have a question though. What is something that gets you hyped up for events? Like what is something, if it's like a person or maybe it's like celebration type, you just know like this will make you really excited and have a good time. One, I once again would say is definitely the people also attending that event. And then two, I do feel like I get, it's not like Sunday scaries, but like ditters before going to an event and alcohol always helps with that a little bit.
[00:14:05.960] 所以，我其实有个问题。什么事情会让你对某个活动充满期待？比如，是某个人，还是某种庆祝活动，让你一眼就能看出它会让你特别兴奋，玩得特别开心？首先，我再次强调，绝对是和大家一起参加活动的人。其次，我感觉我能理解那种感觉，不是那种“周日焦虑症”，而是参加活动前的那种紧张，而酒精总能稍微缓解一下这种紧张。
[00:14:34.300] So I think a good, a good pregame is always a nice way to prepare for a bigger event. If you're going out somewhere or to a festival, to a bigger party, whatever it might be. I think same. It's a people. If there's like a reason we're gathering, like if it's a close friend's birthday or a wedding that we're celebrating, that gets me ramped up. But I think the third thing is like the type of activity. So I love group trips. Like ones I think of are the one we did Crystal for San Diego.
[00:14:34.300] 所以我觉得，一场精彩的赛前聚会总是为更大的活动做好准备的好方法。无论是去某个地方，还是参加音乐节、大型派对，或者其他任何活动，我都这么认为。关键在于人。如果我们聚在一起是有原因的，比如庆祝好友的生日或婚礼，那会让我兴奋起来。但我认为第三点是活动的类型。我喜欢团体旅行。比如我们之前和克里斯托一起去圣地亚哥的那次。
[00:15:04.400] And also I went to Hawaii with Papreet and Serena. Yeah. Just like getting really amped up about a trip with my friends and like being able to eat, explore, go to a new place together, fly together. I think that gets me really excited. If I'm not excited just yet, then alcohol definitely does well. I think for me, I mean, I love events where you celebrate stuff, but I think what really gets me excited is seeing an old friend you haven't seen in a long time and knowing that
[00:15:04.400] 我还和帕普里特还有塞雷娜一起去了夏威夷。是啊。就是那种和朋友们一起旅行，一起吃饭、探索、去新地方、一起坐飞机，想想就兴奋的感觉。我觉得这真的让我很激动。如果我还没兴奋起来，那酒精肯定能让我兴奋起来。我觉得对我来说，我喜欢各种庆祝活动，但真正让我兴奋的是见到很久没见的老朋友，知道……
[00:15:32.160] you'll be able to go to this event and catch up with them. Another thing is if I'm not in the mood to go out yet, I feel like the pre-dinner before going out always helps me get into that and like ease into it a little bit. So if there's not, you know, pure excitement at the beginning of something, having some sort of like mini event, like a pregame, like Heart Precet or dinner will kind of help me ramp up into that too. I think I'm pretty similar with you all. Activity is sometimes a factor.
[00:15:32.160] 你可以去参加这个活动，和他们叙叙旧。还有一点，如果我还没心情出门，我觉得出门前吃顿饭总能让我放松下来，慢慢进入状态。所以，如果一开始没有那种纯粹的兴奋感，参加一些小型活动，比如赛前小酌，像Heart Precet或者晚餐之类的，也能帮助我更好地投入进去。我觉得我和你们都差不多。有时候，活动量也是一个重要因素。
[00:16:01.680] People is definitely one. If I'm going to a party and there's no one I know, I'll be like, shit, should I even go? How was I invited? Knowing that you have at least one really close friend going is always such a safety net. This is a little silly and I guess maybe there's a theme here, but if I have that close friend
[00:16:01.680] 人绝对是其中之一。如果我要去参加一个派对，却发现里面一个认识的人都没有，我就会想，糟了，我到底该不该去？我怎么会被邀请的？知道至少有一个非常要好的朋友会去，总是让人感到很安心。这有点傻，我猜这可能有点老生常谈了，但如果我有这样一个要好的朋友……
[00:16:25.520] who's going with me and then I'm able to plan an escape plan with them, I think that is also very helpful. It actually improves my mood because then I know like, oh, we don't have to stay there the whole time. We can go in, have our fun and then leave and everyone just has a good time. I can just imagine Crystal quietly going, okay, I'm going to go now. Yeah. I'm like, where's the back door? I've never seen her do that.
[00:16:25.520] 谁跟我一起去，然后我就可以跟他们一起制定逃跑计划，我觉得这很有帮助。这真的能改善我的心情，因为我知道，哦，我们不用一直待在那儿。我们可以进去玩一会儿，然后离开，大家都能玩得开心。我能想象克丽丝塔尔悄悄地说：“好了，我要走了。” 是啊。我就想，后门在哪儿？我从没见过她这么做。
[00:16:54.880] She's like, where are the emergency exits? Okay. So Jisoo, you don't mind a pre-dinner event as long as the dinner isn't like the main event. Because I think earlier you said you'd rather be in a house somewhere like in an intimate setting, getting to know people rather than like over dinner. Yeah, actually that's a good point. I guess I just mind when dinner is the event and then it feels like we have to do all of
[00:16:54.880] 她就像在问，紧急出口在哪儿？好吧。所以智秀，只要晚餐不是重头戏，你不介意餐前活动吗？因为我觉得你之前说过，你更喜欢在某个房子里，在一个比较私密的环境中，和大家互相了解，而不是在餐桌上。嗯，你说得对。我只是介意晚餐本身就是重头戏，那样感觉我们好像必须完成所有的事情。
[00:17:20.460] our socializing and all of the memory building at the dinner versus if dinner is the pre-event, then it kind of just feels like a transition period. So there's a little bit less pressure around like the dinner table conversation. So I guess it makes a difference what it's slotted in as. I totally agree with you. I don't like big dinners, like dinners with like huge groups of people because I'm like, oh, I'm just going to get to know like the two people in my corner. Yeah. Because I don't want to yell across the table. Like I will, but I don't want to.
[00:17:20.460] 我们社交和所有在晚餐上建立回忆的机会，如果晚餐是活动的前奏，那感觉就像是一个过渡阶段。所以餐桌上的谈话压力会小一些。所以我觉得晚餐安排在什么位置很重要。我完全同意你的看法。我不喜欢大型晚宴，那种人很多的晚宴，因为我会想，哦，我可能只能认识我身边的两个人。是的。因为我不想在餐桌上大声说话。虽然我可能会这么做，但我不想那样。
[00:17:50.320] Yeah. And I think I'm also just hella paranoid about having like stuff in my teeth or, you know, there's a lot of mishaps that happen when you're talking while eating. Like, of course, not at the same time, but even in similar capacities. If dinner is the main event, then the entire event, I'm just going to be like paranoid about what's in my mouth. But I guess dinner and alcohol aside, is there anything else that you guys do to prep for nights out or events or gatherings to kind of get you hyped up and excited?
[00:17:50.320] 是啊。而且我觉得我特别容易担心牙缝里有东西，或者你知道，边吃边说话很容易出糗。当然，不是同时发生，但类似的情况下也会发生。如果晚餐是重头戏，那整个过程我都会特别在意嘴里的东西。不过，除了晚餐和酒水之外，你们在晚上出去玩、参加活动或聚会之前，还有什么其他准备活动来让自己兴奋起来吗？
[00:18:19.740] This isn't to get hyped up or excited per se, but I think with the age, I definitely try to like hammer a bunch of water and maybe a liquid IV before because I know I'm really bad about drinking water once I'm at an event. So that helps me later down the line. Oh, and if I have some like drunchies at home that I can look forward to. Good prep. Meal prep.
[00:18:19.740] 我不是想借此炒作或兴奋，但我觉得随着年龄增长，我肯定会在活动开始前狂喝水，甚至可能还会输液，因为我知道一旦到了活动现场，我就很难坚持喝水。这样之后就能保持水分充足了。哦，对了，如果家里还有一些可以期待的零食，那就更好了。提前做好准备，提前准备好餐食。
[00:18:46.900] Another thing that me and Stanley do actually is try to remind each other of people's names. So before we go to an event, sometimes I'll go through the particle and I'll be like, okay, name, name, name, name. And just like try to help each other remember the people that are going to show up to this event so we can kind of prepare to say hi. Because I hate those awkward encounters when you're like, hey, they know my name, but I forgot their name. I feel terrible when that happens. And it's like a bad start, right?
[00:18:46.900] 我和斯坦利还会做另一件事，那就是互相提醒对方要参加活动的人的名字。所以，在参加活动之前，我有时会在活动日程表上快速浏览一遍，然后说：“好，名字，名字，名字，名字。” 我们就是想互相帮忙记住要来参加活动的人，这样我们就可以提前做好准备，打个招呼。因为我最讨厌那种尴尬的场面了，比如“嘿，他们知道我的名字，但我却忘了他们的名字”。遇到这种情况我会觉得很糟糕。而且这就像一个糟糕的开始，对吧？
[00:19:16.960] So yeah, me and Stanley will always do that before an event just to prepare. Dude, that's so smart. And that actually has been happening to me a lot where I forget someone's name. Recently, I pulled you aside at one like pregame and I was like, wait, who is that? Like, what is that girl's name again? Like, I know who she is. I know where we met her. All of that. But I just forget her name. After you told me, I kept saying her name in the conversation. And I was like, there must be a point where she was like, huh, Crystal suddenly started saying my name.
[00:19:16.960] 所以，我和斯坦利每次活动前都会这么做，算是提前做准备。哥们儿，这主意真不错。其实我最近也经常忘人名。前几天，有一次赛前聚会，我把你拉到一边，问你：“等等，那是谁啊？那个女孩叫什么名字来着？” 我明明知道她是谁，也知道我们在哪里见过她，所有细节我都记得。但我就是忘了她的名字。你告诉我之后，我在聊天的时候一直念叨着她的名字。我当时就想，肯定有那么一瞬间，她突然意识到：“咦，克丽丝塔尔怎么突然开始念我的名字了？”
[00:19:46.120] She suddenly remembered who I am. Yeah. It's funny. Stanley will actually text me during the event of people that he meets throughout the night so that I don't know, like some sort of like, don't forget. Like, here's a name. Here's another name. And they're always misspelled. Well, like whatever works for you, you know? It's just a hit list. I'm imagining like a whole wall in your apartment with just like Polaroids of people and their names.
[00:19:46.120] 她突然想起来我是谁了。是啊，挺搞笑的。斯坦利会在活动期间给我发短信，告诉我他晚上遇到的人，免得我忘了。比如，这是个名字，这是另一个名字。而且名字总是拼错的。不过，反正只要对你有用就行，你知道吧？这简直就是个名单。我脑补了一下，你公寓里整整一面墙都贴满了拍立得照片，上面都是人名和他们的名字。
[00:20:15.840] Oh my gosh. That'd be crazy. And then you're like, all right, next event. Moving them over into the guest list. I'm like, what is this text? And it's like people's names. That's a good one, though. Do you guys also like debrief beforehand? Like, okay, this person's name is A, boyfriend of B, like works at C. Yes. And I was like, what? What's his girlfriend's name again? Like, who's that one girl that's like, you know? And then he'll remember or I'll remember.
[00:20:15.840] 我的天哪。那也太疯狂了。然后你就想，好吧，下一个活动。把他们移到嘉宾名单里。我就想，这是什么短信？上面都是人名。不过这倒是个好主意。你们也喜欢事先汇报一下吗？比如，好吧，这个人叫A，是B的男朋友，在C公司工作。是的。然后我就想，什么？他女朋友叫什么来着？就是那个……你知道的……女孩是谁？然后他就会想起来，或者我会想起来。
[00:20:44.240] Yeah, it definitely helps to like prep for an event like that. There was like this moment a couple months ago where I went out and it was with a crowd that I didn't really know. And we didn't get briefed on who was who, like on the ride up. So during my conversation with this person, I was like, oh, where'd you go to school? Then he said the name of his school and I was like, oh, do you know so and so? And then it got super awkward because this person was like, oh, yeah, I used to date that person,
[00:20:44.240] 是啊，提前准备一下参加这种活动肯定很有帮助。几个月前，我出去玩，和一群我不太认识的人在一起。出发前也没人跟我们介绍过彼此。结果我和其中一个人聊天的时候，我就问他：“哦，你以前在哪儿上学？” 他说了学校的名字，我就问：“哦，你认识某某某吗？” 然后气氛就变得超级尴尬，因为那个人说：“哦，是啊，我以前和那个人交往过。”
[00:21:13.940] but she like really fucked me over. So I don't really like to talk about it. And I was like, oh, my God, I am so sorry. This was not in the brief. Oh, no. Do you? Okay, well, I guess sort of in relation to that situation and even the let's say, you know, you don't remember somebody's name situation. Do you guys have like a recovery strategy? Wait, I just usually ask Eileen. Oh. Let's say Eileen isn't there.
[00:21:13.940] 但她真的把我坑惨了。所以我不太想谈这件事。然后我就想，哦，天哪，我太抱歉了。这不在简报里。哦，不。你有吗？好吧，我想，就这种情况，或者比如说，你记不住某人的名字的情况，你们有什么补救策略吗？等等，我通常就问艾琳。哦。假设艾琳不在。
[00:21:43.380] I'll just be truthful. I'll be like, I'm so sorry. I don't remember your name, but I know who you are. And I list a bunch of facts about them. A bunch of facts? Crystal, that's so weird. I'll be like, yeah, we met here. And like, I know this. We talked about this last time. But I'm so sorry I forgot your name. That's funny. I mean, yeah, I'll be truthful. I'll be like, we've met before, but I forgot your name. I'm Eileen, by the way. You know, like just to make it okay if like they've forgotten my name. But you know who's a really good vibe setter is actually Nancy.
[00:21:43.380] 我还是实话实说吧。我会说，真抱歉。我不记得你的名字了，但我知道你是谁。然后我会列举一堆关于你的信息。一堆信息？克丽丝塔尔，这也太奇怪了吧。我会说，是啊，我们在这里见过面。然后我会说，我知道这些。我们上次聊过这个。但我真的非常抱歉，我忘了你的名字。真有意思。我是说，是啊，我会实话实说。我会说，我们以前见过面，但我忘了你的名字。对了，我叫艾琳。你知道，这样就算他们忘了我的名字也没关系。不过你知道吗，真正能营造良好氛围的是南希。
[00:22:13.580] She's like a really good, she might not be the host, but she's really good at introducing people. Like she'll say, like, have you met my best friend Eileen and Chris yet? And then she'll introduce me to someone else. And I think that's also a great way. I'll like tap her on the shoulder and be like, I don't remember that girl. Can you introduce us? And she'll like, just do it. So I think having someone like that helps break the ice. That's a good point. Because then you now have the option to be like, oh, we totally met already. But now you also know their name too, just as insurance.
[00:22:13.580] 她人真的很好，虽然她可能不是主人，但她真的很擅长介绍人。比如她会说：“你见过我最好的朋友艾琳和克里斯了吗？”然后她就会把我介绍给其他人。我觉得这真是个好办法。我可能会拍拍她的肩膀说：“我不记得那个女孩了，你能介绍一下吗？”她就会说：“那就介绍吧。”所以我觉得有这样的人能很好地打破僵局。你说得对。因为这样你就可以选择说：“哦，我们之前已经见过了。”但现在你也知道了对方的名字，以防万一。
[00:22:44.040] Exactly. Yeah. Dang. All right. We're recruiting Nancy. Sort of going off that. I think I do find myself sometimes if I'm talking, it might not be the best thing I do, honestly. But if I'm talking to somebody about something and I see somebody walking by that also likes that particular topic, I will totally just pull them into the conversation. And then sometimes I'll even just let them go and I'll like fuck off somewhere. Pass them off to someone.
[00:22:44.040] 没错。是啊。哎。好吧。我们正在招募南希。大概就是这么个意思。说实话，我觉得有时候我说话的时候，可能做得不太好。但如果我和别人聊着聊着，看到有人路过，也对这个话题感兴趣，我就会毫不犹豫地把他们拉进对话里。然后有时候我甚至会放他们走，自己溜之大吉，把他们介绍给别人。
[00:23:13.360] Not in a bad way. I'm like, oh, you guys both like this mutual thing. Like maybe you guys can get along. Or you could be like, how do you know Harpreet? Like the host, you know, like how do you know X, Y, Z? Do you want a shot? What's your name again? The whole laundry list. All easy ways. Get people to introduce themselves. Yeah. These are good ones. And there's also like the wedding version of, so which side are you on? Like groom side or bride side?
[00:23:13.360] 不是说不好。我会想，哦，你们俩都喜欢这种共同点。也许你们能相处得来。或者你可以问，你是怎么认识哈普里特的？就像主持人那样，你知道，你是怎么认识X、Y、Z的？你想喝一杯吗？你叫什么名字来着？等等等等。都是些简单易行的方法。让大家自我介绍。对，这些都是好方法。还有婚礼版的，比如，你是站在哪一边的？新郎那边还是新娘那边？
[00:23:41.240] It's always definitely easier to ask someone for their name when everyone's just a little inebriated. Yeah, I think I did all of those separate questions that you just listed, Eileen, at a housewarming I went to recently. Because I knew like one other person there. So I was like, okay. Including the do you want a shot? I feel like recently my prompt has been like, are you on the bride or groom side? How did you guys meet? If they're from college, like did you see their love story?
[00:23:41.240] 大家都有点微醺的时候，问别人名字肯定更容易些。是啊，艾琳，我最近参加一个乔迁派对，好像问了你刚才列出的那些问题。因为我在那儿只认识一个人。所以我就想，好吧。包括“要不要来杯酒？”。我觉得最近我问的问题都是：你是新郎还是新娘？你们是怎么认识的？如果是大学同学，你有没有看过他们的爱情故事？
[00:24:10.280] Or like, what do you remember about the relationship? You really want to get to know them. I do. Know all the fun facts, but not their name, you know? Sure. What if you're like tired before an event? You need to like bring your energy up. Is there anything that like kind of helps you with that? Definitely a nap. If I have enough time, even if it's like a 15 minute nap, I think it goes a long way. I have to eat something or else I'll show up hangry.
[00:24:10.280] 或者，你还记得这段关系吗？你真的很想了解他们。我的确想。知道所有有趣的事，但不知道他们的名字，你知道吗？当然。如果你在活动前很累怎么办？你需要提提神。有什么方法能帮到你吗？肯定要睡个午觉。如果我有足够的时间，哪怕只是睡15分钟，我觉得也很有帮助。我必须吃点东西，不然我会饿得发脾气。
[00:24:40.160] If it's more of a like a casual event where sometimes it's okay for you to not even show up. There have been times where I just said, sorry, I can't make it. Like I'm not, I'm not feeling it. More often than not, sometimes the entire group is like, yeah, let's just frame check. Damn, you destroyed the whole thing. You know, it's not me. Sometimes it's most of the time neutral. Like for example, yesterday after the hike that we did, the group wanted to hang out again and see what the vibes were.
[00:24:40.160] 如果是那种比较随意的活动，有时候你甚至可以不去。有时候我会直接说“抱歉，我去不了了”，就好像我没心情似的。但更多时候，大家会说：“哎，咱们看看气氛吧。”然后说：“哎，你把整个活动都搞砸了。”你知道，这真的不是我的错。大多数时候，大家的反应都比较中立。比如昨天我们徒步回来之后，大家想再聚聚，看看气氛怎么样。
[00:25:07.560] After one person was like, ah, I might rain check. I'm pretty tired. The rest of the group were like, yeah, us too. I mean, I'm just not hanging out. I feel like that's a learning that I'm trying to get better about because when there's like a social obligation, it's really hard for me to say no to that unless I feel like it's super casual. But there have also been many times where I like pull up to an event even though I'm not feeling my best. And the whole time I'm just like a potato sack. You know, I'm like, it's hard for me to laugh.
[00:25:07.560] 有人说：“啊，我可能改天再来吧，我挺累的。”其他人也说：“是啊，我们也一样。”我的意思是，我就是不想出去玩。我觉得这是我需要努力改进的地方，因为如果有社交活动，除非我觉得是特别随意的场合，否则我很难拒绝。但也有很多次，我明明状态不太好，还是会去参加活动。结果整个过程我都像个麻袋一样，你知道，我很难笑出来。
[00:25:36.740] It's hard for me to like socialize and joke around. And the whole time I'm there, I'm just like, when can I leave? So it's like, maybe it would have been better if I just stayed at home. I think I'm okay about sometimes just not going to an event if I'm really, really not feeling it. Something I'll also do is when I get there, if I'm in that similar situation where like, oh, I'm just going to show up and do what I can. I'll sometimes just tell people I'm not going to stay that long. That's where it gives me a bit of a leash, I guess, to escape if I need to, if I'm really, really not into it.
[00:25:36.740] 我很难融入社交，也很难开玩笑。每次去的时候，我都在想什么时候才能离开。所以有时候，我觉得还不如待在家里。如果我真的完全提不起兴趣，不去参加活动也没什么问题。还有一种情况是，到了现场，如果感觉自己只是露个面，尽力而为，我就会告诉别人我不会待太久。这样一来，如果我真的完全不想去，就可以随时离开，给自己留点余地。
[00:26:06.620] But I can usually turn on my like yapper instincts and at least force a few conversations if I need to. But yeah, sometimes if I'm not feeling it, I just sort of, I'm just there and I'm smiling and I'm vibing. But yeah. Just say you have like a pet at home, you know? Just make up a pet. Yeah. Now we know. Now we know every time you leave for Pepper, we know why you're actually leaving.
[00:26:06.620] 但我通常能开启我的“话痨”本能，必要时至少能勉强搭上几句。不过，有时候如果我没感觉，我就只是待在那儿，笑着，享受当下。嗯，就说你家里养了宠物，你知道吗？随便编个宠物就行了。对。现在我们知道了。现在我们知道你每次去Pepper那里，我们都知道你真正离开的原因了。
[00:26:34.400] I feel like every time I like don't want to go to an event, but I still do, I actually end up enjoying the event. Like more often than not, I'm like, that was really good. Like that was a nice hangout or I'm glad we did that. I can't really think of a time where I was like, oh, that sucked. Why do we go? So I don't know. Maybe that's like the extrovert of me where like, even though I'm exhausted before and have to force myself to go, I end up actually feeling energized after the event. Yeah.
[00:26:34.400] 我觉得每次我其实不太想去某个活动，但还是去了，结果最后反而都挺享受的。很多时候，我都会觉得“这活动真不错”，或者“这次聚会很愉快”或者“很高兴我们去了”。我几乎想不起来有哪次感觉“哦，这活动糟透了，我们为什么要去？”。所以我也不知道为什么。也许这就是我外向的一面吧，虽然之前很累，不得不强迫自己去，但活动结束后反而会感觉精力充沛。嗯。
[00:26:59.760] I think I have a similar thing to Harpreet where like, if I give myself permission to like leave early, then it actually takes away some of the stress. And then that actually helps me let loose a bit more. And then sometimes I might even end up staying longer than I originally had planned. And it's almost like going halfway to know, like instead of fully just like backing out, you're like, okay, I'll just like leave a little early.
[00:26:59.760] 我觉得我和哈普里特的情况有点像，如果我允许自己早点离开，确实能减轻一些压力。这样一来，我反而能更放松一些。有时候，我甚至会比原计划待得更久。这就像是走到一半，然后意识到，与其彻底放弃，不如就提前走一会儿。
[00:27:27.780] And then you see your friends, you're like, oh, actually, it's kind of nice seeing you all. What does leaving early mean to you guys? Like, is it two hours at an event or something else? It's actually, I think every time I do give myself that leash, I end up staying much longer than I originally intended. But I think I'll stay like, I'm going to stick around for like an hour. But like, let's say it is an event where like, there's alcohol involved. You know, you can't, you can't drink it and leave in an hour. Which is okay, too.
[00:27:27.780] 然后你看到朋友们，就会想，哦，其实见到你们真好。对你们来说，提前离开是什么意思？比如，是指在活动上待两个小时，还是别的什么时间？其实，我觉得每次我给自己放个假，最后都会待得比原计划久得多。但我通常会想，我打算待一个小时左右。但比如说，如果是那种有酒的活动，你知道，你不可能喝完酒一个小时就走。当然，这样也行。
[00:27:55.780] Because like, sort of like what we said earlier, like, if everyone's a little inebriated, it's a little easier to just let loose and catch up with maybe even people you don't know. And it always ends up being like two to three-ish hours. I also look at like the time of when the event starts. I'll give myself a time to leave by. So maybe if the event is like 5pm, I'll be like, okay, that means it probably includes dinner. And then afterwards, we're probably going somewhere else.
[00:27:55.780] 因为就像我们之前说的，如果大家都喝得有点微醺，就更容易放松下来，和一些素不相识的人聊聊天。而且通常一到三个小时就结束了。我还会看看活动开始的时间，给自己留个时间离开。比如，如果活动是下午五点，我就会想，好吧，那肯定包括晚餐。晚餐之后，我们可能还会去别的地方。
[00:28:25.380] So if I can just leave by like 10 or something. Or like before midnight. Or not an hour later than midnight. You know, something like that. This is making me realize, I think sometimes if I'm really not feeling an event, I will also have this urge to leave early or stay the acceptable amount of time and then dip, right? Sometimes I'll have this bad habit of asking everyone at the thing. So what time are you guys staying till? Like, what are you leaving? Just to see if it's normal.
[00:28:25.380] 所以如果我能在十点左右离开就好了。或者午夜之前。或者午夜之后不晚一个小时。你知道，大概就是这样。这让我意识到，有时候如果我真的对某个活动提不起兴趣，我也会很想早点离开，或者待到合适的时间就赶紧走，对吧？有时候我会有个坏习惯，问在场的每个人：“你们待到几点？” 比如，你们几点离开？只是想看看这是否正常。
[00:28:54.880] You know, I'm like, where's like the obligatory line? And then I'm realizing now that is like negative vibes. But sometimes a girl just needs to know. Well, what's the typical answer? I feel like a lot of the times people actually have a time. Or if it's not a time, like they'll have like a vibe. When the night gets to this vibe, I'll leave. Like, oh, when it starts quieting down. Or maybe when a couple people leave, like I might start to dip too. And oftentimes I think that is sort of the way that things flow.
[00:28:54.880] 你知道，我当时就想，那句老生常谈的开场白在哪儿呢？然后我现在意识到，那其实是在营造负能量。但有时候，女生就是想知道。嗯，通常的答案是什么？我觉得很多时候，人们其实都有自己的节奏。或者就算没有节奏，他们也会有种感觉。当夜色渐浓，气氛变得不对劲的时候，我就会离开。比如，哦，当气氛开始安静下来的时候。或者当有几个人离开之后，我可能也会开始溜走。很多时候，我觉得事情就是这样发展的。
[00:29:24.900] It just takes that first party of people to leave. And then people start to like trickle out through the night. On this topic, I feel like I'm not really like a flaky person, but I'm low-key flaky at leaving early. Sometimes I'll plan with someone else. Let's leave in this like in between dinner and the next destination. Perfect time to slip away. No one will notice.
[00:29:24.900] 只要第一批人走了，其他人就会像潮水般陆续离开。说到这，我觉得自己其实不算是个不靠谱的人，但我确实有点儿喜欢提前离开。有时候我会和别人商量，比如在晚餐和下一个目的地之间的空档溜走。这是个绝佳的溜走时机，没人会注意到。
[00:29:50.400] And then, you know, that time comes up and the person's like, hey, Crystal, like you ready to go? And then I'm like, wait, shoot, maybe I'll stay an extra hour. It's like you make up the escape plan, but you're not committing to it. It's flexible. It's a flexible escape plan. But I'm like, but you can leave if you want. I'll cover for you. But I might actually stay an extra hour. I have a really bad habit of doing that too.
[00:29:50.400] 然后，你知道，到了那个时间，对方会问：“嘿，克丽丝塔尔，准备好了吗？” 我就会说：“等等，糟了，我可能要多待一个小时。” 这就好比你制定了一个逃跑计划，但你并没有真正下定决心。计划很灵活，很灵活。但我会说：“你想走就走吧，我会替你掩护的。但我可能真的会多待一个小时。” 我也有这种坏习惯。
[00:30:19.880] I mean, I guess it just goes to show that we end up having a pretty good time. It's like being out and socializing is usually a good thing. Well, I kind of want to pivot into setting the vibes at these social events. So now that you have your escape plan, maybe pre-gamed a little and you're physically present at this event, are there things that you try to do to set the vibes? Or do you think your first instinct is to kind of suss it out first?
[00:30:19.880] 我的意思是，这说明我们最终都能玩得很开心。感觉出去社交通常都是件好事。嗯，我想把话题转到如何营造这些社交活动的氛围上。既然你已经有了脱身计划，可能也提前小酌了几杯，而且你也身处活动现场，你会做些什么来营造气氛呢？还是说你的第一反应是先观察一下情况？
[00:30:49.820] Should we narrow down on what type of event? Let's say it's like a house party. Well, that's hard. I think it depends on how early I get there. Maybe I'm like early or really on time. So not too many people are there yet. I will find a corner or I'll find the host maybe to do some small talk to the best of my ability. If it's a house party, maybe even asking the host if there's anything that I can help with.
[00:30:49.820] 我们应该缩小一下活动类型吗？比如说像家庭聚会之类的。嗯，这有点难。我觉得这取决于我到得早不早。也许我会很早就到，或者非常准时。这样到的时候人应该不多。我会找个角落，或者找到主人，尽我所能地和他闲聊几句。如果是家庭聚会，我甚至可以问问主人有没有什么需要帮忙的。
[00:31:17.820] Actually, what was really funny was recently I was at a friend's place. We got there first before everyone else. And she was like, oh, Crystal, do you want to help me like set the table, put out some like snacks and food? I know you mentioned you like having to do something if no one's here yet. I was like, oh, thank you so much for these tasks. Sometimes I like to bring food. If there's a good dessert that I can bring, that could be like, I brought cake.
[00:31:17.820] 其实，最近最搞笑的是我去朋友家玩。我们比其他人都先到。她就说：“克丽丝塔尔，你想不想帮我摆桌子，放点零食和食物？我知道你说过，如果还没人来，你喜欢做点什么。” 我说：“哦，太感谢你了！” 有时候我也喜欢带吃的。比如，如果有什么好吃的甜点，我就会带蛋糕。
[00:31:47.220] And everyone's like, whoa. Get really excited once you like start. I think it also helps out Stanley's with me all the time. So I don't feel like a lone person coming to a house party. Like at least have a partner that I can that we can like tag team and try to like join a conversation. But yeah, I will find the host because typically I know the host or I will find someone else that has gone there first. I will bring alcohol. So I'll try to get the juices flowing if it's like that type of event.
[00:31:47.220] 然后大家都会惊叹：“哇！”一旦开始，大家就会非常兴奋。我觉得这对斯坦利也一直很有帮助。这样我就不会觉得自己孤零零地去参加家庭聚会了。至少有个伙伴可以一起，我们可以轮流搭档，一起加入谈话。当然，我会找到主人，因为我通常认识主人，或者我会找之前去过的人。我会带酒。所以如果是那种类型的聚会，我会努力活跃气氛。
[00:32:16.060] I think if there's food involved, I'm like, oh, would you make or like what type of food do we have tonight? And then I feel like it usually kind of goes naturally from there. When I was thinking about this earlier, I also thought about the definitely asking the host if I can help out in any way. And then that's like a sometimes there's somebody else doing that, too. So it's a good natural way to maybe meet or talk to somebody that's going to be there later.
[00:32:16.060] 我觉得如果涉及到食物，我就会问，哦，你会做饭吗？或者今晚吃什么？然后我觉得话题通常都会顺其自然地发展下去。我之前想到这一点的时候，也想过一定要问问主人我能不能帮上什么忙。有时候也会有其他人帮忙。所以这其实是个很好的方式，可以认识或者和之后会来的人聊聊天。
[00:32:37.960] If I'm getting there later, whatever the event is, I think I just try to like rip off the bandaid really hard and I'll just start introducing myself to people like aggressively. And then I feel like I don't know if this counts in terms of like setting the vibes, but I feel like I can usually at least find one or two people that I'm really vibing with. And then I will try to like break off from them, go go chat with more people. But then if I do find literally just like standing there with nobody, I'll just like go back like, hey, come and insert myself back over here.
[00:32:37.960] 如果我到得比较晚，不管是什么活动，我都会像撕掉创可贴一样，直接开始主动和别人打招呼。我不知道这算不算营造气氛，但我觉得我通常至少能找到一两个真正合得来的人。然后我会试着和他们分开，去和其他人聊天。但如果我真的发现自己孤零零地站在那里，我就会走回去，说：“嘿，过来，我再加入他们。”
[00:33:07.920] Or if they're talking to new people also, I just use them as a segue. That's kind of smart. You're like planting someone in the audience that you can return back to. I need my safe bubble. Another good one is if I if I've never been to the house before, I ask for a house tour. Yes, I love doing that. I'm like, take us around.
[00:33:07.920] 或者如果他们也在和新朋友聊天，我就利用他们作为切入点。这招挺聪明的。就像在观众席里埋下伏笔，方便之后再跟他们搭讪。我需要一个安全的空间。还有个好办法，如果我之前没去过那户人家，我会请他们带我参观一下。没错，我喜欢这么做。我会说，带我们四处看看吧。
[00:33:33.200] And then that usually prompts like, like, well, the backyard or like, you know, I think it also makes people join you. Yeah, like they hear the word house tour. They're like, wait. And then, you know, a couple strangers come on, too. And then that's the perfect opportunity to like meet some new people. Yeah, exactly. Like, give me give me a tour of your plans. I feel like these are pretty good strategies. I mean, I think I'm kind of similar in like the asking for how can I help or bringing something notable to talk about.
[00:33:33.200] 然后，这通常会引出一些话题，比如，嗯，后院之类的，你知道，我觉得这也会让其他人加入进来。是啊，就像他们听到“房屋参观”这个词，就会想，等等。然后，你知道，也会有几个陌生人加入进来。这就是认识新朋友的绝佳机会。没错。比如，带我参观一下你的房屋规划。我觉得这些都是很不错的策略。我的意思是，我觉得我的做法也差不多，比如问“我能帮上什么忙吗？”或者带些值得一提的东西来聊聊。
[00:34:03.400] I remember once we went to Safeway to pick up seltzers or something before a party and they had the hard mountain dew seltzers. So I was like, dude, this is like the one thing I'm going to bring. I'm going to talk about this all night to everyone at the party. Easy social crutch. So we brought it. And that's exactly what happened. Wait, I remember that. The moment I walked in, Jisoo was like, Chris, I brought these like hard mountain dew seltzers. You should go try one. I was like, OK. That's funny.
[00:34:03.400] 我记得有一次我们去Safeway超市买苏打水什么的，准备去参加派对，结果发现他们有卖硬味的激浪苏打水。我就想，哥们儿，这玩意儿我一定要带去。我打算整晚都跟派对上的每个人聊这个。这玩意儿简直是社交神器。所以我们就带了。结果还真是这样。等等，我记得。我刚进门，Jisoo就说，Chris，我带了这种硬味的激浪苏打水。你一定要尝尝。我说，好啊。真逗。
[00:34:33.640] Oh, are they good? Yeah, pretty good. I was going to say, maybe I should go try one. This does remind me one of the last few times I went to alcohol for a function. Me and my housemates found this alcohol and it was a Dorito flavored alcohol. Oh, my God. That sounds gross. I do think I showed the picture to some people at that thing. I was like, look at this. This is crazy. I did not buy it.
[00:34:33.640] 哦，它们好喝吗？嗯，还不错。我正想说，也许我应该去尝尝。这让我想起最近几次参加聚会买酒的经历。我和室友发现了一种酒，是多力多滋味的。我的天哪。听起来真恶心。我想我当时给一些人看了照片。我说，看看这个。这太疯狂了。我没买。
[00:35:29.920] Yeah. We both have like a little bit of our own aesthetic in our homes. For some reason, home decor gets me excited these days. I do actually genuinely get hyped when I see something cool at somebody's house. You know what I've seen a couple of times with guys? I've seen guys look down at the floor and be like, yo, dude, I also have those Costco socks. I've seen this multiple times throughout the last like 10 years and they always bond over it. Oh, my gosh.
[00:35:29.920] 是啊。我们俩家里都有点自己的审美。不知道为什么，最近我对家居装饰特别感兴趣。看到别人家里有什么酷炫的东西，我真的会很兴奋。你知道我见过几次男生之间发生的事吗？他们低头看着地板，然后说：“嘿，哥们儿，我也有那种好市多买的袜子。”过去十年里，我见过好几次这种情况，他们总是能因此拉近彼此的距离。我的天哪。
[00:35:58.860] You know, I do have this coworker that I'm pretty close to and our relationship is like mostly predicated on the fact that we just both love Costco. We were both weeds and we both like Costco. Oh, my God. Costco was a fun group trip, by the way. When we went in Hawaii, that was pretty fun. True. So basically compliment anything in the house or clothing. Start a conversation about it.
[00:35:58.860] 你知道，我有个同事关系特别好，我们俩关系好主要就是因为我们都超爱Costco。我们以前都是宅男宅女，都喜欢Costco。我的天哪。顺便说一句，去Costco的那次集体旅行特别有意思。我们去夏威夷那次也玩得很开心。真的。所以，基本上就是夸夸家里的东西或者衣服，然后找个话题聊聊。
[00:36:28.020] I also just thought of one that could be good, which is asking to start a party game. Mm hmm. Hey, anyone interested in, I don't know, Rage Cage? Crystal's trying to rage. There's only two games that are going to come out of your game. Oh, my gosh. It's Space Nat or 7-11 Doubles. Yeah. You know, if it's a crowd favorite, usually people will be interested in playing.
[00:36:28.020] 我刚才也想到一个不错的点子，就是提议玩个派对游戏。嗯哼。嘿，有没有人想玩，比如说，《愤怒牢笼》？克里斯托尔想发飙了。你们的游戏最后只会衍生出两种选择。哦，我的天哪。要么是《太空纳特》，要么是《7-11双打》。是啊。你知道，如果某个游戏很受欢迎，通常大家都会有兴趣玩。
[00:36:55.500] Or if it's like a brand new game, then I think that also piques everyone's interest. Yeah. Do you think in a party setting, though, are you personally one of the more passive, I guess, people where you let the party come to you? Or are you more active in the sense where, you know, like you're like, hey, who wants to play this game? Or active in getting people together or moving them towards a certain activity?
[00:36:55.500] 或者如果是一款全新的游戏，我觉得也能引起大家的兴趣。是啊。不过，你觉得在聚会场合，你个人算是比较被动的那种，让大家主动来找你玩吗？还是比较主动，比如你会问：“嘿，谁想玩这个游戏？”或者积极地把大家聚在一起，或者引导大家参与某个活动？
[00:37:23.260] Since we've gone to parties together, we should say what we think each other are. So we should all describe Harpreet first. Okay, so the two options are passive or active? Yeah. Okay. I think Harpreet, when he's hosting, is very active in making shots happen. But I think when he's attending, he's a little more passive, but he's always down.
[00:37:23.260] 既然我们一起参加过派对，就应该说说我们对彼此的看法。所以我们先来描述一下哈普里特。好的，所以他的两个选项是被动型和主动型？嗯。好的。我觉得哈普里特如果是主人，会非常积极地安排聚会。但我觉得他如果是参加聚会，就比较被动一些，不过他总是很随和。
[00:37:53.460] Like if you come up to him and you're like, hey, do you want to play a game? Or do you want to take a shot or whatever? Harpreet will be like, okay. And he'll help you set up the game or he'll help you like do the activity. I see that. Yeah, I kind of agree with that. I feel like maybe the way to describe it is he's like the most active, passive person as like a guest. So he won't be like gathering people to be like, guys, let's rage or like, let's play this game.
[00:37:53.460] 比如你走过去问他：“嘿，想玩游戏吗？”或者“想喝一杯吗？”之类的，哈普里特会说：“好啊。”然后他会帮你准备游戏或者帮你一起做活动。我明白。嗯，我有点同意。我觉得或许可以这样形容他：他就像个非常主动的人，但作为客人来说又很被动。所以他不会像有些人那样，召集大家一起狂欢或者玩游戏。
[00:38:21.580] But he'll be like very actively setting vibes one-on-one with people or like in smaller groups, making sure that the energy is generally up. But he won't be like moving the party around to whatever he wants to do. Yeah, I think of active as like Stanley who's like forcing shots down people's throats. And Harpreet is not that. I think as a host, you are definitely more active. But I think you're more of like you float.
[00:38:21.580] 但他会非常积极地与人一对一地互动，或者在小组里营造气氛，确保整体气氛活跃。但他不会随心所欲地掌控派对。是啊，我觉得“积极”就像斯坦利那样，强迫别人喝酒。哈普里特就不是那样。我觉得作为主人，你肯定更积极主动一些。但我觉得你更像是在幕后游刃有余。
[00:38:51.260] Like you try to make sure people are okay in like different circles. You're like, hey, put your bags here in my room. Or like, hey, like what do you guys need? Do you guys need more shots? Do you need more water? You're like very active in terms of like making sure people are comfortable. And then passive, you're like, you're down. But you're not the ones that are like, shot. But you're checking on people for sure. Yeah, I would agree with all that. I think I'm actively passive or whatever Jesus said. Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:51.260] 就像你会努力确保不同圈子里的人都过得好。你会说：“嘿，把行李放到我房间来。”或者问：“嘿，你们需要什么？需要更多饮料吗？需要更多水吗？”你会很主动地确保每个人都感到舒适。然后，你也会很被动，比如，你虽然很放松，但你不会像其他人那样喝得烂醉。但你肯定会关心别人。是的，我完全同意。我觉得我属于那种“积极被动”的类型，或者用耶稣的话来说就是“积极被动”。是的，是的。
[00:39:20.060] When I was going to answer it, I was like, I feel like I play both sides a little bit. But yeah, I'm definitely not one to like get the whole crowd to someplace unless it's like us moving through a festival. Then I will. I don't mind doing that. Yeah. Oh, that's true. At a house. Yeah, I'm definitely just like a floater and I'm making my rounds and drinking alcohol. All right, we should describe Eileen next.
[00:39:20.060] 我当时想回答这个问题的时候，就觉得我好像有点两面派。不过，我肯定不是那种会把所有人都拉到某个地方的人，除非是像音乐节那种场合。那样的话我倒是会。我不介意。嗯，没错。在别人家里。对，我肯定就像个游手好闲的人，到处转悠，喝点酒。好了，接下来我们应该描述一下艾琳了。
[00:39:43.120] I think Eileen is actually surprisingly passive because her friends are more active. Facts. Facts. So she's like, I'll let my friends take the reins and I will support them all the way. Yeah. Yeah, Eileen's friends be active, active. And they know exactly who they are. We don't need multiple actives out there, you know? But they all are.
[00:39:43.120] 我觉得艾琳其实出乎意料地被动，因为她的朋友们都比较活跃。这是事实。所以她会想，我会让朋友们来主导，我会全力支持她们。没错。艾琳的朋友们都很活跃，非常活跃。而且她们很清楚自己是谁。我们不需要太多活跃的人，你知道吗？但她们都是。
[00:40:12.400] You're out-actived. Yeah, actually. But when I do sense like when I'm anxious, I will be active and trying to get people to drink shots. Or if I show up and I'm like, ooh, people are drunk already, I'm like, shots! More, more! Yeah, I was going to say, you definitely also can four shots if you want to drink. And I think you also do float around and you will get to know the room and meet many people. Whether you know them or not, you'll definitely make the rounds. Yeah.
[00:40:12.400] 你有点太活跃了。是啊，确实如此。不过，当我感到焦虑的时候，我就会变得很活跃，想办法让大家喝几杯。或者如果我到了之后发现大家都已经喝醉了，我就会说，再来几杯！再来几杯！对，我正想说，如果你想喝酒，当然也可以来四杯。而且我觉得你也会到处走走，熟悉一下环境，认识很多人。不管你认不认识他们，你肯定都会四处走动。没错。
[00:40:42.280] And find something mutual that you might have for somebody else. I definitely get stressed as a host, though. Like, I do that same thing where I'm like, are people comfortable? Does everyone have everything they need? Sorry our house is small. Yeah, I definitely worry and I get anxious when I host. So I would prefer not to host. Yeah. Well, speaking of hosts, I think Jisoo is a very interesting case. Tell us more!
[00:40:42.280] 而且要找到一些你也能为别人带来的东西。不过，我做房东的时候确实会很紧张。比如，我会想，大家住得舒服吗？需要的东西都齐全吗？不好意思，我们家比较小。是啊，我做房东的时候肯定会担心，会很焦虑。所以我宁愿不做房东。嗯。说到房东，我觉得Jisoo的情况很有意思。跟我们多说说吧！
[00:41:11.560] She actually usually hosts a lot for, like, a couple of our friend groups. When she's host, she's definitely active. But what's really funny is I think she's, like, a little quietly active because she needs to confirm with someone first. She'll be like, oh, James, like, do you think people want to do this? Or sometimes it'll be, like, another friend and she'll be like, do you think people would be down to, like, rage right now? And then once she gets the yes, she's like, all right.
[00:41:11.560] 她其实经常给我们几个朋友群做东。她做东的时候肯定很活跃。但我觉得她其实有点儿“低调”，因为她需要先跟人确认一下。她会问：“詹姆斯，你觉得大家想玩这个吗？”或者有时候是问另一个朋友，她会问：“你觉得大家现在想玩‘狂欢’吗？”然后一旦得到肯定的答复，她就会说：“好的。”
[00:41:40.700] And then she, like, starts moving everyone and hurting everyone. Or sometimes it's like someone else will ask her, like, what if we did this right now? And then Jisoo will be like, okay, let's do that. But have you ever gotten a no, Jisoo? Like, no, now's not the time. I feel like people would typically say yes, right? I think there are probably times where people are like, oh, maybe not right now or something. Oh, okay. I think it's right that I do, like, a buy-in. I want, like, a verbal yes first.
[00:41:40.700] 然后她就开始到处煽动别人，伤害别人。有时候，别人会问她，如果我们现在做这件事怎么样？然后智秀就会说，好啊，那就这么办。但是智秀，你有没有被拒绝过？比如，不，现在不是时候。我觉得大家通常都会答应，对吧？我觉得可能有时候大家会说，哦，也许现在不是时候之类的。哦，好吧。我觉得我应该先得到对方的认可。我想要先得到口头的肯定。
[00:42:10.200] Is it because it's at someone's party, someone else's party? Or is it you as a host? I think when it's me as a host, I like to know that it's going to be something that people will enjoy. But, like, I wouldn't be like, we have to do this. I see. Unless it's a certain point of the night, then maybe I will be like, we have to do this. So you're a considerate host. Yeah. I guess that's the one way of putting it. I've never been the person she confirms with. So I haven't seen that site.
[00:42:10.200] 是因为这是别人的派对吗？还是因为你是主人？我觉得如果是我当主人，我希望确保大家会喜欢。但我不会说“我们必须这么做”。我明白了。除非到了晚上某个特定的时间点，我才会说“我们必须这么做”。所以你是个体贴的主人。嗯。我想这是唯一一种说法。我从来没跟她确认过。所以我没看过那个网站。
[00:42:37.640] But I think she's very active about getting people to play games, moving people around her house, depending on where people are at. And yeah, I think you also float and talk to everybody at your house. Understandably talk to everybody that's at your house if you're hosting. And yeah, I really like last time that you were making people drink stew. I think that was. Oh, yeah. That's like, I feel like that's a super good way to like, oh, with every single person, I'm basically going to have like a mini like one-on-one like catch up for a second. Oh, that's cute. Wait, like you were making cocktails?
[00:42:37.640] 但我认为她很积极地组织大家玩游戏，根据大家的位置安排他们在她家的动向。而且，我觉得你也会到处走动，和家里的每个人聊天。如果你是主人，当然要和每个人都聊聊。对，我特别喜欢你上次让大家喝炖菜的那次。我想应该是……哦，对。我觉得那真是个好办法，可以和每个人进行一次简短的、一对一的交流。哦，真可爱。等等，你是说你在调鸡尾酒吗？
[00:43:07.640] Yeah. I was like, I'm going to make three cocktails and everyone who comes to the door can like pick one. So then there was like a little line of people and mini cocktails I was giving out. Wow. I'm trying to get invited to Jisoo's events. Wow. That's so thoughtful. And I was like, me and Eileen never drank together before. I think we did once, right? For a New Year's. Oh, yes, yes, yes. But that was like a long time ago. Like three or four years ago. Yeah, three or four years ago. Yeah.
[00:43:07.640] 对啊。我就想，我要调三种鸡尾酒，每个来门口的人都可以选一种。然后就排起了小队，我给他们分发迷你鸡尾酒。哇。我正努力争取被邀请参加Jisoo的活动呢。哇。真是太贴心了。然后我就想，我和Eileen以前从来没一起喝过酒。我想我们好像喝过一次，对吧？新年的时候。哦，对对对。但那是很久以前的事了。大概三四年前吧。对，三四年前。嗯。
[00:43:36.780] But I remember at that party, me, Harpreet, Tane and Stanley only knew like four people. Oh, I remember now. Yes, yes, yes. I remember. We like stayed in a corner the entire night. Yeah, Jisoo, that like almost inspired me at our Outside Landsbury game. In my head, I was like, oh, it'd be really nice if I could like use my espresso machine and make everybody a coffee when they came out. If they won one. But then I was like, oh, no, I'm way too stressed for this. I'm nixing this. I was like, no way.
[00:43:36.780] 但我记得在那次派对上，我和哈普里特、塔内还有斯坦利只认识四个人。哦，我想起来了。对，对，对。我记得。我们整晚都躲在角落里。是啊，智秀，你这话差点儿启发了我，在我们玩“兰斯伯里之外”游戏的时候。我当时想，要是能用我的意式咖啡机，在他们出来的时候给他们每个人做杯咖啡就好了。如果他们赢了的话。但后来我又想，哦，不行，我现在压力太大了，做不了这些。我还是算了。我当时就想，绝对不行。
[00:44:04.520] People can be caffeinated before they get here. Yeah, you're your own coffee. Yeah. Caffeine pills. Here you go. Well, last but not least, there is Crystal. How do you guys think you would describe Crystal? Active or passive? Passive. That's so fast. I mean, she's an escape plan. In a corner. I think she told on herself.
[00:44:04.520] 人们来之前就可以喝咖啡提神。是啊，你就是你自己的咖啡。没错。咖啡因药片。给你。好了，最后一位是克丽丝塔尔。你们觉得该怎么形容克丽丝塔尔？主动还是被动？被动。这也太快了吧。我的意思是，她就像个逃生计划。被逼到墙角。我觉得她自己出卖了自己。
[00:44:34.060] The clues are all there. I know. But so she's more passive. But like when it's me and Crystal, she's very active with me, if that makes sense. She'll be like, Aileen, let's take a shot. Let's take a shot. I think she'll be like more active, like one-on-one. But in a group setting, I think Crystal is more of a passive person. Or at least I haven't been to an event you posted, I think. Right, Crystal? Yeah. I think it's always like we go to events together. But I don't think you've ever had to host or be active.
[00:44:34.060] 线索都在那里。我知道。但她比较被动。不过，如果我和Crystal单独相处，她会很主动，不知道你能不能理解。她会说：“Aileen，我们喝一杯吧。我们喝一杯吧。”我觉得她一对一的时候会比较主动。但在群体场合，我觉得Crystal比较被动。或者至少我没参加过你发的活动，我想是这样。对吧，Crystal？嗯。我觉得我们总是一起参加活动。但我觉得你好像从来没有主持过或者主动组织过。
[00:45:01.600] When Crystal hosted her housewarming, I was like, whoa, Crystal is like such a good host because she goes around and like we've all been saying, like checks on everyone, sets up games when they need to be set up, like has all the food prepared and whatnot. I think in a general sense, Crystal can be a passive party person. But the times that she's active is when it comes to like beer pong.
[00:45:01.600] 克丽丝塔尔举办乔迁派对的时候，我就觉得，哇，克丽丝塔尔真是个好主人，因为她会四处走动，就像我们一直说的那样，关心每个人，需要游戏的时候就安排好，食物也都准备好了等等。我觉得克丽丝塔尔总体来说在派对上比较被动，但她一旦活跃起来，比如玩啤酒乒乓球的时候，就会非常投入。
[00:45:25.940] Crystal will always step up to the plate to play some VP and hopefully crush some dudes on the other side of the table. And I feel like that's when you're sometimes the most engaged, ready and fired up to win. True. I'm like, we need to destroy everyone at this party. She's motivated. Yeah. I don't think I'm misremembering this, but I feel like if there's like a circle of people talking, Crystal's pretty good at like leading a conversation. Yes.
[00:45:25.940] 克丽丝塔尔总是会挺身而出，扮演副主席，希望能把对面桌的那些家伙打得落花流水。我觉得那时候她往往是最投入、最有斗志、最渴望胜利的时候。没错。我当时就想，我们得把派对上的所有人都干掉。她动力十足。是啊。我感觉我没记错的话，如果大家围成一圈聊天，克丽丝塔尔很擅长引导谈话。没错。
[00:45:54.840] Because this is me going off outside lands on Friday. Oh, dude. That's alcohol talking. But you're very good at it. No, Crystal, Crystal will yeah. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. I'm a secret yapper. She's a secret yapper. A secret yapper. Like once you have like a topic, she'll like pop off. Very true. That's why we have this. This is her outlet. Yeah. But I feel like that is a pretty hard thing to do because like I find myself in a big
[00:45:54.840] 因为这是我周五在户外即兴说唱的时候说的话。哦，老兄。那是酒精的作用。但你很擅长说。不，克丽丝塔尔，克丽丝塔尔会的。是的。当然。是的。我是个偷偷爱说话的人。她也是个偷偷爱说话的人。一个偷偷爱说话的人。就像一旦你找到一个话题，她就会滔滔不绝地说个不停。确实如此。这就是我们为什么会有这个。这是她的发泄渠道。是的。但我感觉这很难做到，因为我发现自己身处一个很大的……
[00:46:24.540] conversation like that. I'm bad at like, oh, when do I insert myself? But yeah, you were pretty spot on and good about including people in the conversation from what I remember. Wow. Thanks. Very true. I feel like there's many parties or many times where I like turn back to look at Crystal and she's like in some corner, like one on one having like the deepest conversation ever with someone. Wait. That is so true. We were at a bachelorette earlier this year. There were some girls that we were meeting for the first time.
[00:46:24.540] 就是那种对话。我不太擅长，比如，我什么时候该插话呢？不过，你说的很对，而且我记得你很会引导别人参与对话。哇。谢谢。确实如此。我觉得很多时候，比如在聚会上，我回头看克丽丝塔尔的时候，她总是独自待在某个角落，和别人进行着某种深入的谈话。等等。你说得太对了。今年早些时候我们参加了一个单身派对。我们第一次见到了一些女孩。
[00:46:52.940] Later on, the bride of the bachelorette, she told me she was like, dude, like one of the girls you met. She was like, why are we having deep conversations? I'm too blasted for this. Crystal's asking me deep ass questions. Wait, that girl, I ran into her in the bathroom and then she was like, dude, Crystal? And I was like, yeah, what? She's like, Crystal can yap. I was like, I know. It's her superpower.
[00:46:52.940] 后来，新娘跟我说，她当时就觉得，哥们儿，就像你遇到的某个女孩一样。她说，我们干嘛聊这些深度话题？我都喝得烂醉了，根本没法听。克丽丝塔尔问我一些莫名其妙的问题。等等，那个女孩，我在洗手间碰到了她，然后她就说，哥们儿，克丽丝塔尔？我说，是啊，怎么了？她说，克丽丝塔尔能说会道。我说，我知道。这是她的超能力。
[00:47:22.120] Yeah, there's two sides of me. But yeah, I would say that's pretty active. I'm trying to be passive, but sometimes if, you know, the alcohol is flowing, there's some parts that get active. I'm trying to be passive. That's funny. I have a tangential question. This happened the other day and I was like, oh, this actually would be pretty funny to ask you guys. Let's say you're texting someone, say they're on Duna Disturb and it has like the notify anyway button. Uh-huh.
[00:47:22.120] 是啊，我性格里有两面性。不过，我觉得我比较活跃。我尽量让自己保持被动，但有时候，你知道，喝多了之后，某些部分就会变得活跃起来。我努力让自己保持被动，这真有意思。我有个题外话的问题。前几天发生了一件事，我就想，哦，这个问题问你们应该挺有意思的。假设你在给某人发短信，假设对方用的是Duna Disturb，而且它有个“仍然通知”的按钮。嗯哼。
[00:47:52.100] I don't know if I'm into minority, but I just always press this notify anyway button. Like, I'm like so shameless about it. Wait, that's so funny. That's hilarious. I've never even thought to press it. Me neither. I thought it was like, do you want to annoy this person? I was like, maybe if it was an emergency. Yeah. Yeah. That's hella funny. Wait, that's so funny. It's never, almost never an emergency would I press it. Yeah. Damn, I've never, I've always been like, oh, I won't click it.
[00:47:52.100] 我不知道我是不是少数派，但我总是会按这个通知按钮。我就是这么厚脸皮。等等，这太搞笑了。太逗了。我从来没想过要按它。我也是。我以为那是“你想惹恼这个人吗？”之类的。我想，除非是紧急情况。对。对。这太搞笑了。等等，这太搞笑了。我几乎从来没按过，几乎从来没遇到过紧急情况会按它。对。天哪，我从来没按过，我总是想，哦，我不会点的。
[00:48:21.860] It's okay. They'll just respond to me later. That's funny. You savage. That's active behavior right now. Active behavior for sure. I was just like, it can't be that important, right? Like, what are you doing sleeping? But I mean, that's fair. Like most people's phones are probably on vibrate anyway. So. Yeah. They could be watching a movie, Harpreet. Yeah, exactly. It's not that important. Harpreet's like, get over here now. We're pouring shots.
[00:48:21.860] 没关系，他们晚点再回复我。真搞笑，你这人真够狠的。这可是主动行为啊，绝对是主动行为。我当时就想，这事儿应该没那么重要吧？比如，你干嘛睡觉啊？不过想想也对。毕竟大多数人的手机可能都调成震动模式了。所以，是啊，他们可能在看电影呢，哈普里特。对，没错。这事儿没那么重要。哈普里特说，快过来，我们正要倒酒呢。
[00:48:51.360] Talk to me. Well, I have a final question for us all, which is about the exact vibe that you know and love. So how would you describe your favorite vibes at an event that you're going to? I'm hoping that everyone else is super amped up so they can carry the vibe. Ooh, that's a good one. That's a passive. So passive.
[00:48:51.360] 跟我说说吧。嗯，我还有一个问题想问大家，那就是关于你熟悉且喜爱的那种氛围。你会如何描述你即将参加的活动中最棒的氛围呢？我希望每个人都热情高涨，这样才能带动这种氛围。哦，这个问题问得好。这真是个被动的话题。太被动了。
[00:49:18.200] I think for me, good company, good music, good food and intimate, like a community vibe. People are all there to hang out. They're like excited to be there and like want to spend time together. Yeah, definitely the good company part. If the roster of people is like, you know, it's like the perfect group of people. You got your yappers. You're passive. You're active. Everyone's sort of there.
[00:49:18.200] 我觉得对我来说，好的伙伴、好的音乐、好的美食，再加上亲密的氛围，就像一个社区。大家都是来聚会的，都很兴奋，都想一起度过时光。没错，好的伙伴绝对是关键。如果聚会的人员构成很完美，那就说明这里聚集了一群人。有爱说话的，有安静的，也有活跃的。每个人都能找到自己喜欢的氛围。
[00:49:46.360] Maybe even in a setting where you are like, let's say it is like a reunion type setting. I think those are always like, or as of recent, those have always felt the most memorable because it is a little harder to get everyone's like schedule aligned these days. If drinking is involved, I think I do prefer like day drinking nowadays with everybody. Like, yeah, if it's outside or like in somebody, if somebody has like a backyard that we can all just sort of hang out in. That's my ideal, ideal setting.
[00:49:46.360] 或许在那种场合，比如说同学聚会之类的。我觉得这种场合总是，或者说最近几年，总是最令人难忘的，因为现在要协调好每个人的时间安排有点难。如果喝酒的话，我现在更喜欢和大家一起在白天喝。比如，如果是在户外，或者在某个朋友家的后院，我们可以一起待在那里，那就完美了。那是我最理想的聚会场合。
[00:50:12.260] I think for me, the ideal good vibes are just like a setting where everyone is kind of feeling their best on their A game, ready to come and enjoy whatever event it is. Something that happens occasionally is when you get an old group of friends together and everything is just magically funny. There are just those nights where you start to go hoarse from laughing too much. Like your cheeks hurt. All the jokes are fire and, you know, you're bringing up old memories and whatnot.
[00:50:12.260] 对我来说，理想的轻松氛围就像是每个人都状态最佳、精神饱满，准备好尽情享受任何活动。有时候，和一群老朋友聚在一起，气氛就会变得特别欢乐。有些夜晚，大家笑到嗓子都哑了，脸都疼了。所有的笑话都特别精彩，而且，你知道的，大家还会一起回忆起很多往事。
[00:50:40.360] So I think those kinds of events are always my favorite. This is random, but recently I've been thinking about a really good couch. That's a really good vibe. If it can fit everyone, if it's comfortable, if everyone's just around the couch, I feel like that also sets a really intimate vibe. I enjoy those couch types of settings. A good couch is a great setting.
[00:50:40.360] 所以我觉得这类活动一直都是我的最爱。说起来有点跑题，但我最近一直在想一张舒适的沙发。那种氛围真的很好。如果沙发能容纳所有人，如果很舒服，如果大家都围坐在沙发旁，我觉得那会营造出一种非常亲密的氛围。我喜欢这种沙发氛围。一张舒适的沙发就是绝佳的氛围。
[00:51:07.180] Yeah, I can definitely relate to our other friend group from San Diego. Like when we all get together, it's just like random noises. We're laughing for no reason. And yeah, those are definitely the best. Yeah, I think at the end of the day, a lot of the vibes is like the attitude you bring and the people around us, their attitude as well. I think it was really interesting to hear about all of our different approaches in getting ready,
[00:51:07.180] 是的，我完全能理解我们在圣地亚哥的另一群朋友。我们聚在一起的时候，总是会发出各种莫名其妙的声音，莫名其妙地大笑。没错，那种感觉真的太棒了。我觉得归根结底，很多时候氛围都取决于你的态度，以及你周围人的态度。我觉得听大家分享各自不同的准备方式真的很有意思。
