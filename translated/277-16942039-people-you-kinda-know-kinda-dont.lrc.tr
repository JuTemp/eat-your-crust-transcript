[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Brian. And I'm Jonathan.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Brian。我是Jonathan。
[00:00:17.450] So today we have two familiar voices on Brian and Jonathan to talk about a topic that I feel like is very funny. It's something that I personally think about all the time as someone who has a lot of social anxiety. It's people you kind of know, kind of don't. This is a very specific subset of people. And the way you interact with these people can sometimes differ from the way you interact with
[00:00:17.450] 今天，我们请到了布莱恩和乔纳森两位熟悉的声音，来聊聊一个我觉得很有趣的话题。作为一个有社交焦虑的人，我经常会想到这个问题。就是那种你似认识又似不认识的人。这是一群非常特殊的人。你和这些人互动的方式，有时会和你与其他人互动的方式截然不同。
[00:00:40.670] people you know or are close with and also even the way you interact with strangers. So let's kick this off by talking about our personal rule of thumb for saying hi to someone you kind of know, kind of don't. Honestly, this is very difficult because I feel like the setting really matters. But just like very generically, I'll probably hide. I'm gonna be honest.
[00:00:40.670] 你认识的人、关系亲近的人，甚至你与陌生人的互动方式，都会影响你的社交习惯。所以，我们先来聊聊我们个人的打招呼小规则，特别是当你跟一个似是而非的人打招呼的时候。说实话，这真的很难，因为我觉得场合很重要。但一般来说，我可能会躲起来。我得坦白地说。
[00:01:05.930] I think I'm like the total opposite. I think at all events, I think my rule of thumb when I see someone, no matter how well I know them is always to be like excited when I greet them. So I think my default greeting in most settings is like, dude, what's up, man? And give them a quick dab. And in professional settings, of course, give them a quick like shake.
[00:01:05.930] 我觉得我跟你完全相反。我觉得无论什么场合，我见到人都会很热情地打招呼，不管我跟对方有多熟。所以我觉得在大多数情况下，我的默认打招呼方式是：“哥们儿，最近怎么样？”然后跟他们快速地打个招呼。当然，在正式场合，我会跟他们快速地握手。
[00:01:26.250] Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. This is probably something that like dominates my mind space more than it should in a social setting. I feel like if it usually will come down to if I feel like I've actually had a conversation with the person before. But there's definitely been times where like, you know, you've met the person before, but you don't know if they remember you or it's been a while. So it's kind of hard to navigate.
[00:01:26.250] 是啊，我实话实说。在社交场合，这件事可能占据了我太多的精力。我觉得最终还是要看我之前是否和这个人有过交流。但确实也有一些时候，你知道，你以前见过这个人，但你不知道他们是否还记得你，或者已经很久没见了。所以这种情况就有点难处理。
[00:01:48.090] Wait, that's so true. I feel like even in the you kind of know them, you kind of don't spectrum, there's also like a you really don't know them. And oh, you like, you know, you kind of know them.
[00:01:48.090] 等等，这说得太对了。我觉得即使在“你有点认识他们，又有点不认识他们”这种关系里，也存在着“你真的不认识他们”的情况。哦，对了，你好像又有点认识他们。
[00:02:00.650] Right. And I feel like depending on the setting, it can feel like there's more pressure, like social pressure almost. So I feel like a very easy one is if you're at a big party, and then you're waiting in line at the bathroom or something or like some sort of secluded corner, and then you bump into someone you like kind of know that it's very easy to strike up conversation. It's like more private, whatever. But what I find really hard is like when you walk into a big social setting, there's all these people and people are kind of turning to look at whoever just walked in, and then you have to go and see what's going on.
[00:02:00.650] 没错。我觉得根据场合的不同，压力也会有所不同，感觉像是社交压力。比如说，在一个大型派对上，你在洗手间排队或者在某个僻静的角落里，碰巧遇到一个你喜欢的人，这时很容易就能搭讪。因为比较私密，所以更容易开口。但我觉得真正难的是，当你走进一个大型社交场合，周围都是人，大家都会转头看向刚进来的人，然后你还得走过去看看发生了什么。
[00:02:30.650] say hi to everyone in that room. Like, I just hate that. And I cannot handle that. Oh my god, that is so tough. I think it's tough for both ends. Because even if you're on the receiving end, what if they like skip you and you're like, oh, shit, they don't remember me. Oh, that's tough. True, true. I think the bathroom situation you brought up, Jisoo, just like waiting in line, I think that's my worst nightmare. Because some people it's like, you see them, you kind of know them, you want to greet them, but you can't keep a whole conversation going with them.
[00:02:30.650] 跟房间里的每个人都打招呼。我真是讨厌这样。我受不了。天哪，这太难了。我觉得对双方来说都很难。因为就算你是被打招呼的那一方，万一他们直接跳过你，你就会想，糟了，他们不记得我了。哦，那太难受了。没错，没错。我觉得你提到的洗手间的情况，Jisoo，就像排队一样，我觉得那是我最害怕的事。因为有些人，你看到他们，你有点认识他们，你想跟他们打招呼，但你没办法跟他们聊上几句。
[00:02:56.690] But when you're by the bathroom after like two or three lines of I don't know, how's the weather or something, it just gets awkward when it gets quiet. It's just like, cool. And then it's just like scroll on your phone. I don't know.
[00:02:56.690] 但当你跟人聊了两三句，问了些诸如“天气怎么样”之类的问题后，在洗手间旁边，突然安静下来的时候就有点尴尬了。感觉就像，好吧，然后就开始刷手机。我也不知道。
[00:03:08.110] I feel like I'm the exact opposite as Jisoo. I feel like something like the bathroom line, it almost like is a situation to actually be able to strike up a conversation. Whereas if you're like going into the party, and it's just this big room, you kind of have to like make your way across the room and go out of your way to say hi to the person. So I actually like the bathroom conversations. Now I know this is like a spectrum. Are you a bathroom person or like an entrance person? Introvert or extrovert?
[00:03:08.110] 我觉得我和Jisoo完全相反。我觉得像在洗手间排队这种场合，反而更容易开启对话。但如果是去参加派对，在一个很大的房间里，你就得费劲地穿过人群，主动去和别人打招呼。所以我其实挺喜欢在洗手间聊天的。我知道这只是个光谱。你是喜欢在洗手间聊天还是喜欢在入口处聊天？你是内向还是外向？
[00:03:37.710] What do you prefer, Jisoo? I mean, the whole reason that I brought up the bathroom thing in the first place was because that's like my comfort zone. And I think similar to Brian, having a conversation is actually fine. It's more of like entering that and like getting to that and also doing it in public. That really freaks me out.
[00:03:37.710] Jisoo，你更喜欢哪种方式？我之所以一开始就提起洗手间的事，是因为那里对我来说比较自在。我觉得和Brian一样，聊天其实没什么问题。问题在于进入那个状态，找到那个话题，而且还要在公共场合进行。这真的让我很紧张。
[00:03:54.050] So then I also like to hide like you, Crystal. I will say that when this happens in a professional setting, it puts a different spin on it. I feel like hiding in a social situation where it's more casual or maybe you're around your friends is kind of okay. But sometimes I feel like hiding in a workplace situation feels like I'm a bad employee or something. So then I'm like, okay, I need to like put my game face on, rile up my inner Jisoo and go out to like socialize with people.
[00:03:54.050] 所以，Crystal，我也跟你一样喜欢躲起来。不过，在职场上，这种事发生的感觉就完全不一样了。我觉得在比较轻松的社交场合，或者跟朋友在一起的时候躲起来还好。但有时候，在工作场合躲起来，感觉就像我是个糟糕的员工似的。所以，我就得打起精神，唤醒我内心的Jisoo，出去跟人社交。
[00:04:20.810] Thankfully for me in work, I guess for me, it's because I work from home a lot. So when I am in office, it's like nice to see other people. But luckily I have my own office. I don't know if you guys do. But what do you guys do if someone recognizes you, but you don't recognize them? Is this in a professional setting? Just like in any setting. They go up to you and they're like, Crystal, what's up? Long time no see. And I don't know them. You just don't know them.
[00:04:20.810] 谢天谢地，我的工作比较轻松，我想是因为我经常在家办公。所以当我在办公室的时候，能见到其他人感觉挺好的。幸运的是，我有自己的办公室。不知道你们有没有。如果有人认出你，但你却不认识他们，你们会怎么做？这种情况是在正式场合吗？或者像在任何场合一样。他们走过来跟你说：“Crystal，你好吗？好久不见。”但我根本不认识他们。你就是不认识他们。
[00:04:46.110] I'm going to be completely honest. I don't think that has happened. But if that were to happen, I think I would just try to fake it. Actually, this really depends on the other person's attitude. If they seem like slightly more cautious, they're not coming on too strong. I might be like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. I know your face, but I forgot your name.
[00:04:46.110] 说实话，我觉得这种情况没发生过。但如果真发生了，我想我会假装没事。其实，这主要取决于对方的态度。如果他们比较谨慎，没有表现得太热情，我可能会说：“哎呀，真抱歉。我认得你，但我忘了你的名字。”
[00:05:10.070] If they come on really strong, though, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I feel like it's rude. If I don't know who they are, then I'll try to fake it. Crystal, I forgot your name, but I remember your face. The classic. It's like the go-to. That's a good one, honestly. I have also not really had this happen to me, but I've seen it happen to my husband a bunch of times. And it's so funny because he'll always play it off. That's like the default. He'll never admit to not knowing the person.
[00:05:10.070] 不过，如果他们表现得太热情，我就会觉得，哎呀，这样太没礼貌了。如果我不知道对方是谁，我就会假装不认识。比如我会说：“克丽丝托，我忘了你叫什么名字，但我记得你的脸。” 这招很经典，几乎成了我的万能借口。说真的，这招挺管用的。我自己倒是没怎么遇到过这种情况，但我见过我老公好几次。特别搞笑的是，他总是能巧妙地掩饰过去，这已经成了他的惯用伎俩。他永远不会承认自己不认识对方。
[00:05:36.210] And I'll always be like, oh, yeah, totally seen you around before, bro. Like, blah, blah, blah. And then later when that person inevitably walks away, I'm like, oh my God, who was that? He's like, no idea. I feel like it would be awkward to be like, I don't actually know you and like demand an explanation. So maybe it is better to just play it off. I feel like in those situations, I'm probably more like James where I just play it off. I'm just like, dude, long time no see, man. We'll chop it up. And when they leave, I'll probably turn to one of my friends and be like, who is that again?
[00:05:36.210] 我总会说：“哦，是啊，兄弟，以前肯定见过你。”之类的。然后过一会儿，当那个人走开后，我就会想：“我的天，那是谁啊？”他就会说：“不知道。”我觉得如果直接说“我其实不认识你”，然后追问原因，会很尴尬。所以也许最好还是装作若无其事。我觉得在这种情况下，我可能更像詹姆斯那样，会装作若无其事。我会说：“哥们儿，好久不见了。咱们聊聊吧。”等他们走了，我可能会转头问我的朋友：“那是谁来着？”
[00:06:05.410] I don't think I've ever encountered this situation either. But I feel like with playing it off, there's like this risk of them referencing something that they think you'll know. And then eventually you'll just have to be like, all right, honestly, I don't really know who you are. And it just becomes even more awkward than it was initially. So honestly, props to James for never really encountering that situation. I feel like he is pretty good at playing it off.
[00:06:05.410] 我好像也没遇到过这种情况。但我觉得如果装作没事人，他们可能会提到一些你觉得你应该知道的事情。到时候你就只能说，好吧，说实话，我其实不认识你。这样反而会比一开始更尴尬。所以说真的，詹姆斯真厉害，从来没遇到过这种情况。我觉得他很擅长掩饰。
[00:06:30.970] Side tangent, there's this girl that apparently I met at UCSD. Not apparently, I met her at UCSD. Like we even follow each other on Instagram then. But she's friends with my housemate. So over the past three years, I've been seeing her at a lot of events. And every single time I see her, I go around and say hi to everyone because I know everyone else. But I'll go up to her and I'll be like, nice to meet you. I'm Jonathan. Oh, no.
[00:06:30.970] 跑题一下，有个女孩，我好像是在加州大学圣地亚哥分校认识的。不，不是好像，我就是在那里认识的。我们甚至在Instagram上互相关注了。她是我室友的朋友。所以过去三年里，我在很多活动上都见过她。每次见到她，我都会跟其他人打招呼，因为我认识所有人。但我走过去跟她说话的时候，会说：“很高兴认识你。我是乔纳森。” 哦，不。
[00:06:55.190] And she'll be like, nice to meet you. I'm X. And this went on for so long until one time I did that. And I just see her boyfriend cracking up and I was like, what's going on? And she's like, we've we've met each other so many times. We've known each other since undergrad. And I was like, there's no fucking way. So I listened to this podcast recently. This influencer was saying that she never says nice to meet you anymore. She'll always be like, oh, it's so good to see you or like nice to see you again. Just on the off chance that they like actually met.
[00:06:55.190] 她会说：“很高兴认识你。我是X。” 就这样持续了很久，直到有一次我这么做了。我看到她男朋友笑得前仰后合，我就问：“怎么回事？” 她说：“我们见过好多次了。我们从大学就认识了。” 我当时就想：“不可能吧。” 最近我听了一个播客。一个网红说她现在再也不说“很高兴认识你”了。她总是会说：“哦，见到你真好”或者“很高兴再次见到你”。就当是碰巧认识而已。
[00:07:25.330] So I guess good to see you is like a very generic one, right? Like you don't know if you've met before or not. Maybe you got to start doing that, Jsu. Yeah, I've got to whip it out. Good to see you. Have you guys had the opposite situation happen to you, though, where you know someone and you're like, yeah, this person has no idea who I am. So I think if I ever have the inkling where someone might not remember me, I just won't greet them.
[00:07:25.330] 所以我觉得“很高兴见到你”这句话很笼统，对吧？就像你不知道之前有没有见过面一样。也许你也该开始这么做了，Jsu。是啊，我得赶紧说出来。“很高兴见到你”。不过，你们有没有遇到过相反的情况，就是你认识某个人，结果发现他根本不认识你？所以我想，如果我感觉有人可能不记得我，我就干脆不打招呼了。
[00:07:51.270] I think my ego might take a hit. Like if they just look at me blankly, I think I might just leave the event. I think I'm similar to Jsu, but not for ego purposes. I think it's just the easiest excuse to get myself out of having to introduce myself to someone. Yeah, I don't think this has ever happened to me either. I feel like I will only say hi to someone if I'm certain that they'll remember me or that we've had an interaction before.
[00:07:51.270] 我觉得我的自尊心可能会受到打击。比如，如果他们只是茫然地看着我，我可能就会直接离开。我觉得我和Jsu的情况差不多，但不是为了维护自尊心。我觉得这只是我逃避自我介绍的最简单借口。是啊，我觉得这种情况也从来没发生在我身上过。我感觉只有当我确定对方会记得我，或者我们之前有过接触的时候，我才会主动跟人打招呼。
[00:08:15.950] But something that does happen somewhat often is I feel like you have like friends of friends who you know of and you've heard their names a lot. But sometimes when you meet them, you can't really remember if you've met them or if it's just like you've heard their names a lot over the years. So that's kind of like a tricky situation that I hate. Oh my God, that reminds me of my birthday party last year. It was so funny because a bunch of people were already at my place and then we were all like gathered around our dining table.
[00:08:15.950] 但经常会遇到这种情况：你认识一些朋友的朋友，也经常听到他们的名字。但有时候，当你真正见到他们时，却想不起来之前是否见过，或者只是因为这些年经常听到他们的名字而感到困惑。这种情况挺让人头疼的。天哪，这让我想起了我去年的生日聚会。当时真是太搞笑了，一大群人已经到我家了，然后我们都围坐在餐桌旁。
[00:08:44.410] And then 40 minutes into it, Brian came. It's like all of us sitting around at the table and then he like walks in through the door. So everyone turns and then he goes and greets all like 12 or 13 people around the table, like one by one. And after that, I was like, damn, that's actually like super brave. If I were you in that situation, I probably would have just been like, hey, sat down in a corner like, so what are we doing, guys? And then did the intros later when there were less eyes. That is honestly what I really wanted to do.
[00:08:44.410] 过了40分钟，布莱恩来了。当时我们都围坐在桌旁，他突然推门进来。大家都转过身，他挨个跟桌边的十二三个人打招呼。之后我就想，哇，他真够勇敢的。如果换作是我，我可能就直接躲到角落里，问大家“我们这是在干嘛？”，然后等周围人少的时候再做自我介绍。说实话，我本来也想这么做。
[00:09:14.110] But I feel like your guys' kitchen layout is pretty unfriendly to that. And it's like a small room. So it would have been as awkward as it was to like go around and say hi to like 12 people I kind of know, kind of don't. It would have been even worse to just like walk in with 12 pairs of eyes on me and just sit down and be like, hi. Wait, so was it just like totally quiet while Brian was going around saying hi to everyone? Yes. I remember this super quickly. Like, in fact, when Jisoo brought up this topic, it was like the first thing I thought of. Oh my God.
[00:09:14.110] 但我感觉你们家的厨房布局不太适合这种打招呼的方式。而且厨房很小。所以，就算要我挨个跟十二个似是而非的人打招呼，也会很尴尬。更糟糕的是，如果我走进去，被十二双眼睛盯着，然后坐下来说“嗨”。等等，所以布莱恩挨个跟每个人打招呼的时候，厨房里就完全安静吗？是的。我记得特别清楚。事实上，当智秀提起这个话题的时候，我第一个想到的就是这个。我的天哪。
[00:09:45.210] Wait, was I there yet? I think you had just gotten there or you came like right after Brian or something. Okay, because I was going to say I don't even remember this. So that probably means don't worry about it. Thanks. Unless I wasn't there. Then I'm sorry. No, I think you were there. So sad I missed out on that. Brian was talking earlier about like friends of friends when you hear a lot about them and stuff. Have you guys ever heard so much about someone and then met them and they're like totally different from what you imagined?
[00:09:45.210] 等等，我当时在那儿吗？我觉得你刚到，或者你好像是布莱恩之后来的。好吧，因为我本来想说我完全不记得这件事了。所以那可能意味着你不用担心了。谢谢。除非我当时不在。那我就抱歉了。不，我觉得你当时在。真可惜我错过了。布莱恩之前说过，就是那种朋友的朋友，你经常听到关于他们的各种消息。你们有没有过这种经历：听说了某人很多事，然后见到他本人，结果发现他跟你想象中的完全不一样？
[00:10:13.350] Oh, honestly, yeah. Many times. And it's always, I think, in a positive spin. I'll usually meet someone and be like, wow, this person is way nicer than I imagined or like way cooler than I imagined. Yeah, but your friends are just not gassing them up. This is a tough question because I feel like nowadays social media gives you an extra window into not even just hearing about a friend of a friend.
[00:10:13.350] 哦，说真的，是的。很多次。而且我觉得，总是往好的方面想。我通常会遇到一些人，然后想，哇，这个人比我想象的要好得多，或者比我想象的要酷得多。是啊，但你的朋友们可没夸他们。这个问题很难回答，因为我觉得现在社交媒体让我们能更全面地了解情况，而不仅仅是通过朋友的朋友。
[00:10:39.750] Maybe it's like not too off from what you hear and see. Okay. But honestly, I think that's kind of a double edged sword because I don't know about everyone else in this episode slash listening, but I can be kind of like a social media creep sometimes.
[00:10:39.750] 也许跟你听到的和看到的差不多。好吧。但说实话，我觉得这其实是把双刃剑，因为我不知道这期节目里的其他人怎么样，但我有时候确实有点像个社交媒体上的窥探狂。
[00:11:24.430] Sometimes. And like a certain sliver of their life. You know, I'm not going to bring that up and be like, oh, I love your Twitter. They like tell you something. You're like, I actually already knew that. Wait, actually, that kind of happens to us. I think when people meet us who are like friends of friends and maybe they've listened to like one or two podcast episodes, they'll be like, oh, my God, I lowkey know a lot about you because of the podcast.
[00:11:24.430] 有时候是这样。就像他们生活中的某个片段。你知道，我不会特意提起这件事，然后说：“哦，我喜欢你的推特。”他们会告诉你一些事情。你会想：“其实我早就知道了。”等等，其实，这种情况也经常发生在我们身上。我觉得当人们通过朋友的朋友认识我们，可能他们听过一两期播客节目，他们会说：“我的天哪，我通过播客对你们了解得还挺多的。”
[00:11:53.850] How does it make you feel when they say that? Honestly, I'm like internally laughing because I'm like, I wonder what they're suppressing. What they're like, oh, I actually already knew that or something of the sort. I still think the funniest is one of my friends. I forget what we were talking about, but I think it was something related to like Jesus birthday. I was like, oh, I'm going to be missing that. And she asked me a question about some recent event. And I was like, I actually don't know what they've been up to. And she's like, oh, haven't they? And then she was like listing it off.
[00:11:53.850] 他们这么说的时候你是什么感觉？说实话，我当时心里暗自发笑，因为我在想，他们到底在憋着什么？会不会是那种“哦，其实我早就知道了”之类的？我觉得最搞笑的还是我一个朋友。我忘了我们当时在聊什么，但好像跟耶稣的生日有关。我说，哦，我肯定要错过这个节日了。然后她问了我一个关于最近发生的某件事的问题。我说，我其实不太清楚他们最近在忙些什么。她说，哦，是吗？然后她就开始一一列举。
[00:12:22.070] And I was like, you know way more about Jesus and Crystal than I do right now. I mean, honestly, even aside from social media and our podcast, this is totally something that happens. There's this one person who I haven't seen this person since like high school. Right. But this person and I both have a mutual friend that we're very close to. So every time I hang out with that mutual friend, they're like, oh, you know, I was going to see the other guy. But we couldn't make plans because it's his parents birthday or something.
[00:12:22.070] 我当时就想，你现在对耶稣和克丽丝塔尔的了解比我多得多。说真的，就算抛开社交媒体和我们的播客不谈，这种事也确实会发生。我认识一个人，自从高中毕业后就没见过了。对吧？但我跟这个人有一个共同的朋友，我们关系特别好。所以每次我跟那个共同的朋友一起出去玩，他们就会说，哦，你知道吗，我本来打算见见那个人的。但是我们没能安排上，因为那天是他父母的生日之类的。
[00:12:50.750] And then I'll just go home and be like, OK, August 2nd is this person's parents birthday. And it's just like forever memorialized in my brain. You got like a notebook where you're writing all this info down? Basically. I thought this story was going to go in a different direction. Everything comes back to me knowing too much about people. I thought it was going to be something like if you have maybe, yeah, a mutual friend, but you're not as close to that mutual friend.
[00:12:50.750] 然后我就回家，突然想起，好吧，8月2号是这个人父母的生日。这就永远铭刻在我脑子里了。你是不是有个笔记本，把这些信息都记下来了？差不多吧。我本来以为这个故事会往另一个方向发展。结果最后还是跟我对别人了解太多有关。我以为会是那种，比如你们可能有个共同的朋友，但你跟这个共同朋友关系没那么亲近。
[00:13:18.250] And then you're like, oh, I saw on their social media they got engaged or something. And then your friend's like, wait, what the fuck? I didn't know. I will say if I know I know information that I guess I wouldn't have normally known if I didn't see it on their social media if my friends didn't tell me. Sorry, that was like a whole lot of words together. I saw Brian's eyes just look up and I was just like, oh, I'm losing the plot here. I was trying to figure out what the fuck you're saying.
[00:13:18.250] 然后你就说，哦，我看到他们在社交媒体上订婚了什么的。然后你朋友就说，等等，什么鬼？我不知道。我得说，如果我知道的话，如果不是在他们的社交媒体上看到，或者朋友告诉我，我本来是不会知道的。抱歉，我刚才说了好多。我看到布莱恩抬起头，我就想，哦，我有点懵了。我正努力想弄明白你到底在说什么。
[00:13:49.730] If I meet someone and I know things about them, I keep it in my back pocket. It's like my secret conversation sprinkling. When I'm talking to them, I'll kind of guide the conversations towards things that I know that they're interested in or like places that they might have traveled. And then it like helps to keep the conversation going. And they'll be like, oh, shit. How did you know that? I was like, oh, no, it's crazy. Heard through the grapevine. Yeah, he did a grapevine. It's like, you know, they're engaged and you're like, so what are your thoughts on marriage?
[00:13:49.730] 如果我遇到某个人，并且了解一些关于他的信息，我会把这些信息藏在心里。就像我的秘密谈话秘诀一样。当我跟他聊天的时候，我会引导话题走向他感兴趣的事物，或者他可能去过的地方。这样有助于让谈话继续下去。然后他会说：“哦，天哪！你怎么知道的？” 我就会说：“哦，不会吧，太不可思议了。” 是听别人说的。对，他通过小道消息打听到的。你知道，就像，他们订婚了，然后你问：“你对婚姻有什么看法？”
[00:14:21.170] This kind of makes me wonder, though, if you're actually, let's say, going to a party or some sort of social event. And you know that most of the people there are people that you kind of know, kind of don't. Do you prep for this somehow? Oh, dude, I'll ask my friends who know most of the people there. I'll be like, who are the people going again? Oh, who do they know there? And then, you know, in your mind, you can kind of get ready.
[00:14:21.170] 这让我不禁想到，如果你真的要去参加一个聚会或者其他社交活动，而且你知道那里的大部分人你都认识，但又不太熟悉。你会为此做些准备吗？哦，哥们，我会问问我那些认识大部分人的朋友。我会问，都有哪些人去？哦，他们都认识哪些人？然后，你知道，你就可以在脑子里做好准备了。
[00:14:47.890] You prepare your script on the bullet points of each person. Checking the notes on what I have on these people. Juicy is going to go in like, oh, my God, isn't it your dad's birthday? And Jonathan will be like, so thoughts on like engagement ring prices lately? Hey, nice to see you. Hey, how much do you think you should spend on engagement stuff?
[00:14:47.890] 你根据每个人的要点准备好脚本。查看我掌握的关于这些人的笔记。Juicy会说：“我的天哪，今天是你爸爸的生日吗？”然后Jonathan会说：“最近订婚戒指的价格怎么样？”“嘿，很高兴见到你。”“嘿，你觉得订婚用品应该花多少钱？”
[00:15:16.410] I don't think I'll try to prep too much. I actually will try to not think about it too much because I feel like it can be like a source of stress. So it's usually better to just like not think about it and just improvise or like play it by ear almost when you're in the situation. Yeah, honestly, sometimes I wonder if it would be better to go to a party where everyone was just a stranger. I'm like, would that make me less anxious? And I think every day, like depending on my mood and my comfort levels, the answer changes.
[00:15:16.410] 我觉得我不会做太多准备。实际上，我会尽量不去想太多，因为我觉得那样反而会成为压力来源。所以通常来说，最好就是别想太多，到时候随机应变，或者说随机应变。说实话，有时候我会想，去参加一个全是陌生人的聚会会不会更好。我会想，那样会不会让我不那么焦虑？我觉得每天，根据我的心情和舒适程度，答案都会不一样。
[00:15:44.150] Like some days I truly would prefer just meeting a room full of strangers. And I think that would be easier. But other days, it is nicer to kind of go in with a certain link, you know, to this person, no matter how tenuous it is. I don't know if I have any preparation, but I do feel like a lot of dread going to parties where I kind of know everyone. I think in those environments too. I don't know if you guys feel this. I'm like super bad at talking to people, mutuals. And I don't know why. I think I brought this up with some other people before.
[00:15:44.150] 有时候我真的宁愿直接去见一群陌生人。我觉得那样会更容易些。但有时候，如果能和这个人建立起某种联系，哪怕这种联系很微弱，也会感觉更好。我不知道自己是不是有什么准备，但我确实很害怕去那种几乎所有人都认识的聚会。我觉得在那种环境下也会这样。不知道你们有没有这种感觉。我特别不擅长和人聊天，包括和共同认识的人。我也不知道为什么。我想我之前也跟其他人提过这件事。
[00:16:13.470] Your mutual friends are friends with all of your friends. So it's like they have to be like a certain type of personality. But then when you meet them, you don't know how far you can push it. Like you don't know how comfortable or casual you can be. You don't know how weird you can be. I feel like I'm holding myself back the whole time and just trying to feel out how casual I can be around them. I don't know if what I said just made sense. You're waiting for someone to open the gates. Yeah, exactly. There we go.
[00:16:13.470] 你们的共同朋友都跟你的所有朋友是朋友。所以感觉他们肯定得是某种特定性格的人。但当你真正见到他们时，你又不知道该如何把握分寸。你不知道自己能有多放松自在，多随意。你不知道自己能有多古怪。我感觉自己一直在克制自己，只是在试探自己跟他们相处时能有多放松。我不知道我刚才说的有没有道理。你一直在等有人为你打开那扇门。对，没错。就是这样。
[00:16:44.190] I need to wait for them to like act a certain way first. And I'm like, all right, cool. We're on the same vibe here. Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think it's very comfortable around your group of friends and you know exactly how unhinged you can get. Like you already know that boundary. But with people who are mutuals, you don't know that. The limit testing process is more awkward because you kind of know where it should be generally. But you don't know exactly what that point is. Versus if it were with strangers, you wouldn't even have that expectation in the first place.
[00:16:44.190] 我得先等他们表现得像我一样。然后我就想，好吧，酷。我们感觉很合拍。嗯，我觉得这说得通。和朋友在一起感觉很自在，因为你很清楚自己能做到什么程度。就像你已经知道界限在哪里了。但和那些互关的人在一起，你就不知道了。试探底线的过程会更尴尬，因为你大概知道底线在哪里，但你不知道那个点到底在哪里。而如果是和陌生人，你一开始就不会有这种预期。
[00:17:13.710] So I think I understand. Yeah. Jisoo, you and Crystal summed that up perfectly. Dude, there's been so many times where I'm limit testing. I'll say something fucking just quiet. I'll be like, damn, that was a total miss. And I'm like, all right, I'm going to go to the bathroom now. Where you're going to meet more people. Dude, I agree though, because I think there's a certain desperation when you're speaking with these people you kind of know, kind of don't. Especially if you have a mutual friend.
[00:17:13.710] 所以我想我明白了。是啊。Jisoo，你和Crystal总结得太好了。兄弟，我试过太多次试探底线了。我会说一些很轻声细语的话。然后我会想，糟了，这完全失算了。然后我就想，好吧，我现在要去洗手间了。在那里你会遇到更多的人。兄弟，我同意你的看法，因为我觉得当你和那些你似认识又似不认识的人说话时，会有一种莫名的渴望。尤其是当你们有共同的朋友时。
[00:17:44.270] You're grasping for topics that aren't related to the mutual friend. That's true. And you're just like, what the fuck do we talk about? But you just default to like, oh, so mutual friend and you have hung out recently, right? How'd you guys be? Oh, college? That's sick. This is like that curse situation when like you're in a group of three hanging out and both of you are really good friends with a third person. And they like go to the bathroom or something like that.
[00:17:44.270] 你绞尽脑汁地想找些跟共同朋友无关的话题。没错。然后你就想，我们到底该聊些什么？最后只能无奈地说，哦，对了，你们有个共同的朋友，最近见过面，对吧？你们最近怎么样？哦，大学？那太好了。这就好比是那种尴尬的情况：三个朋友一起出去玩，你们俩都跟第三个人关系特别好。然后他们就去洗手间什么的了。
[00:18:12.790] So you're just sitting there like, so how's the weather? Exactly. Okay, but I have a question for you all. Have you ever turned one of these, you know, kind of know, kind of don't slash mutual friends into a close friend? And please share the plan layout. I feel like I have, but I think for guys, it's a lot easier. Actually, you know what? I take that back.
[00:18:12.790] 所以你就坐在那儿，问：“天气怎么样？”没错。好吧，但我有个问题想问问大家。你们有没有把那种，你知道的，有点儿暧昧，不太喜欢的共同好友，发展成亲密朋友？请分享一下你们的计划。我觉得我好像做到了，但我觉得对男生来说，这要容易得多。其实，你知道吗？我收回刚才的话。
[00:18:41.850] It might be easier for guys because I feel like sometimes for guys, it's like you see each other maybe two or three times and you're like homies. But there's been instances where I've seen people like once or twice. And then maybe on like the second or third time, I'm like, dude, let's go grab a brew sometime. We're like, let's go. Let's go get coffee or do something. And we end up doing that. And we just end up hanging out and stuff. Yeah, I think I've also had this happen. Well, okay. I can think of like two times that I've tried or like the situation has arose. But I think only one situation was successful.
[00:18:41.850] 对男生来说可能更容易些，因为我觉得有时候男生之间，可能见过两三次就成了哥们儿。但也有些时候，我见过一个人一两次，然后可能第二次或第三次的时候，我就说：“哥们儿，找个时间一起喝杯咖啡吧。”我们就说：“走吧，去喝咖啡或者做点别的。”然后我们就真的去了。最后就一起出去玩什么的。嗯，我觉得我也遇到过这种情况。好吧，我能想到两次尝试或者说这种情况发生的两次。但我觉得只有一次成功了。
[00:19:11.370] Once I met someone who was really close friends with a friend of mine at this like hangout. She and I like talked the entire night. A couple months later, we were like, oh, we should like go hang out somewhere and go shopping or something. So then we like spent the whole day together. And then I was kind of like, I don't know where that magic of that night went. But it wasn't feeling as natural or as smooth. Just with our locations and stuff, we just naturally didn't hang out more. And I was like, oh, okay.
[00:19:11.370] 有一次，我在一个朋友聚会上认识了一个人，她和我一个朋友关系特别好。我和她聊了一整晚。几个月后，我们觉得应该找个地方一起逛逛街什么的。于是我们就一起待了一整天。之后我就觉得，不知道那天晚上那种奇妙的感觉都去哪儿了。感觉没那么自然流畅了。可能是因为我们住的地方不一样之类的原因，我们自然而然就没再多见面了。然后我就想，哦，好吧。
[00:19:37.550] But recently, I had that same thing happen, except it was a success story. And this person and I are friends now. So I was like, very happy about it. I think it takes a lot of effort on both sides. But also something just has to like click. Yeah, I think it's definitely based off personality too. Because I'm thinking and one of my friends actually met Jisoo. And I think they ended up hanging out afterwards too.
[00:19:37.550] 但最近我也遇到了类似的事情，只不过这次很成功。我和这个人现在成了朋友。所以我当时特别开心。我觉得这需要双方付出很多努力。当然，也得是那种感觉对了。嗯，我觉得性格肯定也很重要。因为我想起我有个朋友之前见过Jisoo，而且之后她们好像也经常一起出去玩。
[00:20:06.230] I think sometimes when you straight up just ask the other person that you think is like super chill, if they're down to hang out, I think it just takes like one person to bring it up. And the other side will be like, dude, I'm hella down. And I feel like you both have to be looking for new friends, maybe. Or maybe that's just how I feel. Like sometimes I feel like I'm open to new friends. And then sometimes I'm like closed off. But yeah, I think in the success stories, I was open. It's valid. Also, is it specifically guys like hit each other up after?
[00:20:06.230] 我觉得有时候，如果你直接问一个你觉得特别随和的人，问他/她愿不愿意一起出去玩，可能只需要一个人先开口。对方就会说：“哥们儿，我超想！”我觉得你们俩可能都想认识新朋友吧。或者这只是我个人的感觉。有时候我觉得自己很乐于结交新朋友，有时候又会比较封闭。不过，我觉得在那些成功的例子里，我都是比较开放的。这很正常。还有，是不是都是男生之间互相联系？
[00:20:32.150] Because I feel like a lot of mutual friends you also make by way of just exposure to them, repeated exposures. Like you'll see them at events a lot. And eventually the next time you see them perhaps in like a group event or just like on the street or something, you'll just be like super stoked to see them. That's true. I think evolving a friendship into a deeper friendship with like one-off people versus like groups is a lot harder because then you need both sides to consistently ask to hang out,
[00:20:32.150] 因为我觉得很多共同的朋友都是通过反复接触而建立起来的。比如你会经常在一些活动上看到他们。然后下次再见到他们，可能是在集体活动上，也可能是在街上，你会特别兴奋。确实如此。我觉得和这种偶尔见面的人发展成更深厚的友谊，比和一群人发展成更深厚的友谊要难得多，因为后者需要双方都持续主动约对方出去玩。
[00:21:02.330] especially in the beginning, a lot to get that repeated exposure. And then at a certain point you become closer. But then like in our adult lives, it's a lot harder to get that. But if it's just like a person that's a part of another friend's group, then you kind of know like, oh, I'll probably see them again. Wait, but Brian, I feel like you had to really turn on the like friend making setting when you were in Seattle.
[00:21:02.330] 尤其是在刚开始的时候，需要反复接触才能建立起这种联系。然后到了某个阶段，你们的关系就会变得很亲密。但是到了成年生活，这种亲密感就很难再出现了。但如果对方只是另一个朋友圈子里的人，你就会觉得，哦，我可能还会再见到他们。等等，布莱恩，我觉得你在西雅图的时候，真的得特别努力地去结交朋友才行。
[00:21:29.270] And I feel like you ended up expanding a pretty large friend group. Do you feel like that was turning people who are like in that kind of no kind of don't level to like good friends? Yeah, I definitely had to like turn on the get over your social fears and just put yourself out there mode. I feel like it kind of goes back to what you said earlier, where it was kind of like a slow exposure over time to seeing the same people over and over again. But they were like mutual friends because it was one of my close friends from home.
[00:21:29.270] 我觉得你最终扩大了朋友圈。你觉得这是否让那些一开始对你不太友好、甚至有点排斥的人也变成了好朋友？是的，我确实需要克服社交恐惧，勇敢地走出去。我觉得这有点像你之前说的，需要时间慢慢熟悉，才能和同样的人反复接触。但他们都是共同的朋友，因为其中一个是我家乡的好朋友。
[00:21:58.410] It was his group of college friends. So I guess I kind of inherently like knew I would like hanging out with them or want to get to know them more. I feel like there was definitely more of an effort because I think like when I would see them, we would vibe pretty well, to be honest. Like I knew that if we spent more time together, we'd be really good friends. At the same time, I feel like from both ends, it was a little bit more like a laid back or like passive approach to friendship. So no one really like took huge initiatives on like a one on one level.
[00:21:58.410] 那是他大学时的朋友圈。所以我想我本能地就知道我会喜欢和他们一起玩，或者想更了解他们。我觉得我肯定付出了更多努力，因为说实话，每次见到他们，我们相处得都很融洽。我知道如果我们多花时间在一起，肯定会成为非常好的朋友。但同时，我觉得双方对友谊的态度都比较随意，或者说比较被动。所以没有人特别主动地去发展一对一的关系。
[00:22:26.510] It was just kind of like getting closer in like the setting of a friend group over time. But we did kind of like joke about it a lot when we were hanging out in a friend group. Like we would vibe really well and be like, we have to hang out one on one. And then we wouldn't for like a really long time. But I feel like after like a year or two, we became really good friends. And then we would hang out like one on one a lot more. Or it was just like a lot more comfortable and like a lot more of like a foundation of a friendship.
[00:22:26.510] 感觉就像是在朋友聚会的氛围里，随着时间的推移，彼此的关系越来越亲密。不过，我们以前经常开玩笑说，如果和朋友们一起玩，感觉特别合拍，就会说：“我们得单独出去玩玩。” 然后，我们可能很久都没单独出去过。但我觉得，大概一两年后，我们就成了非常好的朋友。之后，我们单独相处的时间就多了很多。或者说，那种单独相处的感觉更自在，也更能奠定友谊的基础。
[00:22:50.530] Do you guys ever feel awkward when you're trying to, I guess, make a friendship into a deeper friendship? Maybe it's like someone you just meet in a group and then you hit them up afterwards. Do you guys feel it's awkward in the conversation phase afterwards, I guess? Honestly, yeah, I feel like it's really difficult to put yourself out there. And sometimes what kind of throws me off is if someone is really close friends with my close friend, then I know they have that bond.
[00:22:50.530] 你们有没有过这样的经历：想把一段友谊发展成更深层次的友谊时，会觉得有点尴尬？比如，在一次聚会上认识了某人，之后你主动联系他/她。之后聊天的时候，你们会不会觉得有点别扭？说实话，是的，我觉得主动接近对方真的很难。有时候，如果对方和我的好朋友关系特别好，我反而会觉得有点不自在，因为我知道他们之间有那种特殊的联系。
[00:23:15.330] So then I think subconsciously, instead of letting the friendship slowly get there, I'm like, oh, we should be just as close as those two. And then I'll like bring up deep topics or something. And then sometimes we'll be like having a meal or whatever. And then I'm like, whoa, this dinner got like really heavy. And I think it was my fault. I think the fact that they're even reciprocating with you just goes to show like how comfortable they feel with you too.
[00:23:15.330] 所以我觉得潜意识里，我没有让友谊慢慢发展，而是想着，哦，我们应该像他们俩一样亲密。然后我就会提起一些比较深入的话题。有时候我们会一起吃饭什么的。然后我就觉得，哇，这顿饭聊得好沉重啊。我觉得这是我的错。我觉得他们能对你做出回应，就说明他们也觉得和你在一起很自在。
[00:23:42.330] I think I've had it the other way where it's like Jesus said, you share like a really good friend and you know they have chemistry as friends and you have chemistry with the mutual friend too. So by the transitive property, you guys should also like be really good friends. If you hit them up one on one, there can be like this almost pressure a little bit to hope that like it works out. And there's definitely been times where like following up with them afterwards and getting dinner like felt like a little bit more on the awkward side.
[00:23:42.330] 我觉得我的情况正好相反，就像耶稣说的那样，你和他们有一个非常好的朋友，你知道他们之间很有默契，而你和这个共同的朋友之间也很有默契。所以根据传递性，你们也应该会成为非常好的朋友。如果你单独联系他们，可能会有点压力，希望他们能成功。而且确实有些时候，之后再联系他们，比如一起吃顿饭，会感觉有点尴尬。
[00:24:10.730] So yeah, I've had like experience like the other way around. Okay, dude. But honestly, like when was the last time you hung out with someone one on one who you're like maybe not even that close with? Dude, I use I don't know if you guys have used this before Bumble BFF. Oh, so I heard one of my friends using it. Firstly, I didn't know guys had a Bumble BFF. So I was like, dude, I can meet my boys on there and I ended up actually making one really good friend.
[00:24:10.730] 所以，是啊，我也有过类似的经历。好吧，哥们儿。说真的，你上次和关系不太熟的人单独出去玩是什么时候？哥们儿，我用过Bumble BFF，不知道你们之前有没有用过。哦，我听一个朋友说在用。首先，我之前不知道男生也有Bumble BFF这个功能。所以我就想，哥们儿，我可以在上面认识我的哥们儿，结果我真的交到了一个非常好的朋友。
[00:24:39.310] But the first time we met up to get lunch, so fucking awkward for me because I'd be like asking about it. I'm like in my head. I'm like, dude, I promise I'm not hitting on you. This is just part of the process because it's like you're asking them questions about their life and it's like the same things you would ask like on a date and stuff. I'd be like, oh, you have like older sisters. That's crazy. Like how was it growing up with like three sisters? Jace is like, how many kids do you want? How long do you want to date before marriage?
[00:24:39.310] 但第一次见面吃午饭的时候，我尴尬得要死，因为我老是问这问那。我心里想着，哥们儿，我保证我不是在撩你。这只是个过程，因为你要问他们一些关于生活的问题，就像约会时会问的那些问题一样。我会说，哦，你还有几个姐姐。真厉害。跟三个姐姐一起长大是什么感觉？杰斯会问，你想要几个孩子？你想谈多久恋爱再结婚？
[00:25:08.450] I think messaging was even more awkward because I would type something out. I'd be like, I don't want them to misinterpret my intentions right now. I mean, that's so true. And I honestly feel like I haven't really hung out with people one on one unless I'm already really close with them. It's been a while since I've done that at least. So I'm like, I'm out of practice. Like if I were to hang out with someone one on one and I'm not that close with them, I
[00:25:08.450] 我觉得发短信更尴尬，因为我会打字。我会想，我不想让他们误解我的意思。我的意思是，这确实如此。老实说，除非和对方关系特别好，否则我感觉自己很少和别人单独相处。至少我已经很久没这么做了。所以我觉得自己生疏了。比如，如果我和不太熟的人单独相处，我就会觉得很尴尬。
[00:25:34.810] need to like go through my prompts and stuff, like refresh them, you know, bring them up to 2025 up to date. Crystal's updating her internal Google Sheets. Yeah. She's patching. She's patching. I'm like, what are appropriate questions to ask at this age now? Do you guys remember your like first few, I guess, like social interactions after COVID when things started opening up more? I remember when I was like at larger events.
[00:25:34.810] 需要检查一下我的提示之类的，更新一下，你知道，把它们更新到2025年。Crystal正在更新她的内部Google表格。是的，她在修补。她在修补。我就想，现在这个年纪应该问些什么问题比较合适呢？你们还记得疫情后，当各种活动开始逐渐恢复正常时，你们最初的几次社交互动吗？我记得我参加过一些大型活动。
[00:26:04.730] This is like maybe once things started opening up from COVID more. It's been so long since I've talked to strangers and stuff. In there talking to people, I'd be like, dude, I feel like fucking awkward right now. Like, damn, take me away from here. I'll say something. I'll be like, that's a miss. Like, I just I just cringe internally. I'm just like, why did I even say that? I have this like distinct memory of going to a party for the first time after COVID and walking in and being like, this is way too loud. Like I was like actually distressed. I was like, why are people screaming?
[00:26:04.730] 这感觉就像疫情结束后一切都开始慢慢恢复正常的时候。我已经很久没跟陌生人说话了。在那种场合跟人聊天，我就会觉得，老兄，我现在感觉尴尬死了。就像，天哪，快带我离开这里。我会说些什么，然后就会觉得，这话说错了。我内心会感到无比尴尬。我会想，我当时为什么要说那些话？我清楚地记得疫情后第一次去参加派对，走进去就觉得，这也太吵了吧。我当时真的非常难受。我心想，为什么大家都在尖叫？
[00:26:35.250] Let's use our inside voices. My life has been on mute for the last two years. Oh my God. Wait, so true. I think one of my first bigger social interactions was also like a house party. And I was just like, oh my God, I don't know how to interact with people right now. And I think I only had maybe two good friends at that party and the rest of the people I didn't really know.
[00:26:35.250] 咱们小声点儿说话吧。过去两年我的生活简直像静音了一样。我的天哪。等等，说得太对了。我记得我第一次比较重要的社交活动好像也是参加一个家庭聚会。当时我就想，我的天哪，我现在都不知道该怎么跟人相处。那次聚会上我大概只有两个好朋友，其他人我都不太认识。
[00:27:01.230] So I was like, holy fuck, this is like awkward crystal times a hundred. Crystal got put through the ringer. Yeah. I mean, I think that's such a good point. Actually, a lot of us had to kind of re-socialize ourselves post COVID, myself included. I think one of the things that really came up as like a constant fear for me when meeting mutual friends or like people I kind of know was this fear that I was doing something in
[00:27:01.230] 所以我就想，我的天，这简直比克丽丝托尴尬一百倍。克丽丝托真是受尽折磨。是啊。我觉得你说得太对了。实际上，疫情之后我们很多人都得重新适应社交，包括我自己。我觉得在和共同朋友或者认识的人见面时，我一直很害怕的一件事就是，我怕自己会做出什么不恰当的事情。
[00:27:29.370] a weird way or like in an awkward way and that everyone was judging me, which I feel like rarely happens unless you're like really, really reclusive or something like you're probably completely fine and just like a normal functioning member of society. But I would talk to people who are mutual friends and have this fear of, you know, later if my mutual friend were to ask this person like, oh, I saw you talking to Jisoo, like how'd it go? Would this person have something good to say about me or something negative or like neutral?
[00:27:29.370] 感觉很奇怪，或者很尴尬，好像每个人都在评判我。我觉得这种情况很少发生，除非你真的非常非常孤僻，或者像个正常人一样融入社会。但我会和共同的朋友聊天，然后害怕以后如果我的共同朋友问这个人：“哦，我看到你和Jisoo聊天了，怎么样？”这个人会说我的好话、坏话还是中立的话？
[00:27:57.410] And I think that fear would kind of govern and guide the way I was interacting with these people. And it would also be the guardrail to feeling comfortable around them. Do you still have that now, Jisoo? Yeah. But I think some days it's worse than other days. Other days I can like really, you know, silence it and like put it on mute. But some days I feel it a lot. That's valid. Earlier when I was talking about the limit testing, the feeling I had was very similar to what you just brought up to.
[00:27:57.410] 我觉得那种恐惧感会左右我与这些人互动的方式，也会成为我与他们相处时感到自在的保障。Jisoo，你现在还有这种感觉吗？嗯。但我觉得有时候会比其他时候更严重。有些时候我可以完全屏蔽掉这种感觉，就像把它关掉一样。但有些时候，这种感觉却很强烈。你说得对。之前我谈到极限测试的时候，我的感受和你刚才说的很相似。
[00:28:22.850] I'm just worried that other people would think I'm a fucking weirdo, which granted there have been moments where like I'll say something and afterwards my friend will be like, did you say this to them? I was like, yeah, dude, just don't bring it up, man. Like, like I regret saying it. Tell them I said my bad. And I feel like it's also just tough because when people are at the level where you don't quite know them, you don't know what you have in common yet.
[00:28:22.850] 我只是担心别人会觉得我是个怪人，当然，有时候我也会说错话，事后朋友会问我：“你跟他们说了这话吗？” 我就会说：“是啊，哥们儿，别提了，真的。我都后悔说了。告诉他们我刚才说错了，对不起。” 我觉得这也很棘手，因为当和别人关系还不熟的时候，你不知道你们之间有什么共同点。
[00:28:52.830] So what is the question you ask to figure out that, you know, connection? So it's just like really awkward as you try to cover every single base in the world, finding that like one or two connections. I had this situation come up kind of recently where so I recently moved into a new place and I met a lot of my housemates friends and they invited me to a Friendsgiving at the end of last year.
[00:28:52.830] 所以，为了找到那种联系，你会问什么问题呢？你知道，就是那种试图面面俱到，却只能找到一两个联系的尴尬情况。我最近就遇到过这种情况：我刚搬到新地方，认识了室友的很多朋友，他们邀请我去参加去年年底的感恩节聚餐。
[00:29:20.670] And I saw them again because we hosted a Super Bowl thing a couple of weeks ago and saw a lot of the same people. So I like knew that we had talked to each other and talked for a little bit, but I couldn't remember what we had talked about. So I didn't really want to like rehash the same conversations. And I also couldn't remember if they remembered what we talked about either. So I didn't really want to like, you know, like give it off that I was like faking it or not really knowing like what the fuck I'm doing, to be honest. So yeah, it's definitely a tough situation. Yeah.
[00:29:20.670] 我又见到他们了，因为几周前我们一起办了个超级碗活动，见到了很多老面孔。我知道我们之前聊过，也聊了一会儿，但我记不清聊了些什么。所以我不太想重复那些老生常谈。而且我也不确定他们是否还记得我们聊了些什么。所以，我不想显得像是在装模作样，或者说实话，我根本不知道自己在干什么。所以，这确实是个棘手的情况。
[00:29:52.210] Dude, also, I feel like if I were in that situation, I would feel really awkward and I would have the urge to like reintroduce myself. But then that's also like, oh shit, what if they're offended? They're like, wait, we've already met. Like, you don't need to introduce yourself. But then also it's like, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Like, what if, you know, they didn't remember and I'm letting them off the hook for this time? Yeah. So this actually did happen to me at the Super Bowl thing.
[00:29:52.210] 老兄，我觉得如果我遇到这种情况，我会觉得很尴尬，很想重新自我介绍一下。但转念一想，糟了，万一他们生气了怎么办？他们可能会说，等等，我们已经见过面了，不用自我介绍了。但同时我又想，还是应该给他们一次机会。万一他们真的不记得了，这次就放过他们吧？嗯，这事儿在超级碗的时候真的发生在我身上了。
[00:30:17.670] I said hi to someone and yeah, I think I introduced myself and I kind of played it off as like in case you don't remember me, but it was definitely like, I'm not sure if I remember you. But yeah, he was like super chill about it. He was like, oh yeah, like I remember we talked a bit like at the last Friendsgiving. I was like, yeah, exactly. Like, good to see you again, man. So I remember we talked for like an hour. I thought we became really good friends. Damn, that's brutal. I mean, I'm not going to lie. Sometimes I feel like it's almost like a social contract.
[00:30:17.670] 我跟一个人打了招呼，嗯，我想我做了自我介绍，我当时装作好像在说“万一你不记得我了”，但其实我心里想的肯定是“我不确定我是否记得你”。不过他倒是挺淡定的。他说：“哦，对啊，我记得我们上次在朋友聚餐的时候聊过一会儿。” 我说：“对啊，没错。很高兴再次见到你，哥们儿。” 我记得我们聊了大概一个小时。我觉得我们成了很好的朋友。哎，这太残酷了。说实话，有时候我觉得这就像一种社交契约。
[00:30:46.470] That person would probably know that you were debating on like introducing yourself or not. So then I feel like he should have just played it off too. Like, oh yeah, nice to meet you. Because I've been on the receiving side where I'm like, damn, this person is reintroducing themselves to me. But I uphold my end of the social contract and I introduce myself back. Wait, I almost view it as a acknowledgement. Like, oh, don't worry, I remember you. Oh, interesting. Not a, you know, I'm not trying to say like, hey, yo, what the fuck?
[00:30:46.470] 那个人可能知道你还在犹豫要不要自我介绍。所以我觉得他也应该装作若无其事的样子。比如，“哦，很高兴认识你。” 因为我也遇到过这种情况，当时我会想，“天哪，这个人又要重新自我介绍了。” 但我还是会遵守社交礼仪，做出自我介绍。等等，我甚至觉得这是一种回应。就像，“哦，别担心，我记得你。” “哦，有意思。” 而不是那种，你知道的，我不是想说，“嘿，哟，你他妈在干嘛？”
[00:31:16.970] I remember you. It's more like, oh, I remember you too. Yeah, don't worry. I think in those situations, I actually use it as an opportunity to get even more casual with them. Because as soon as they forget they met you, I feel like you kind of have like the higher ground to just like fuck around. I'll just be like, dude, you seriously forgot. And then I'd be like, dude, we talked for hell along last time. And you can just mess around with them a little bit. And I'll just be like, dude, I'm just playing. I don't even remember your name. Oh.
[00:31:16.970] 我记得你。更像是，哦，我也记得你。是啊，别担心。我觉得在这种情况下，我其实会利用这个机会和他们更随意一些。因为一旦他们忘了见过你，我觉得你就更有优势可以胡闹了。我会说，哥们儿，你真的忘了。然后我会说，哥们儿，我们上次聊了很久。你可以稍微逗逗他们。我会说，哥们儿，我只是开玩笑。我甚至都不记得你的名字了。哦。
[00:31:47.550] Yeah, I think generally everyone probably has some degree of the same concern, like when they meet someone that they know they've met before. But obviously, like the connection is pretty surface level. So I feel like people are pretty forgiving or understanding if the other person maybe doesn't remember or is also like unsure. It's definitely happened to me where I kind of remembered and the other person didn't. I didn't take it too like personally or anything like that.
[00:31:47.550] 是的，我觉得大家可能都会有类似的顾虑，比如遇到以前见过的人。但显然，这种感觉很肤浅。所以我觉得如果对方不记得或者也不确定，大家都会比较宽容和理解。我自己也遇到过这种情况，我记得，但对方却不记得了。我并没有太放在心上。
[00:32:14.310] But I think like the thing everyone wants to avoid is awkwardness or like feelings of discomfort. So everyone just kind of like plays it off, wants to like move past the moment. Actually, that's a really good point, because this reminds me of my 10 year reunion, actually, because there's so many people where you once knew to varying degrees. And then now you're like, wait, low key, I don't remember their name. Or maybe like they've matured.
[00:32:14.310] 但我认为大家最想避免的就是尴尬或不自在的感觉。所以大家都会尽量掩饰，想尽快结束这个尴尬的时刻。其实，你说的很有道理，因为这让我想起了我的十年同学聚会，当时有很多人你以前或多或少都认识。但现在你会想，等等，我好像不记得他们的名字了。或者，也许他们成熟了。
[00:32:41.630] So you're like, oh, my God, this person's so familiar, but I can't place who they are. And there were definitely some people where I was like, shit, I like forgot your name. And there was part of me where I would, you know, pull up Facebook in the corner and look them up before approaching them just to double check. I got their name. But there was also moments where you just can't get around it. And you're just like, I'm so sorry. Like, I forgot your name.
[00:32:41.630] 所以你会想，天哪，这个人好眼熟，但我就是想不起来他是谁。确实有些人，我会想，糟了，我居然忘了你的名字。有时候我会在搭讪前打开Facebook，查一下他们的信息，再确认一下。我记住了他们的名字。但也有一些时候，你就是没办法避免这种情况。你只能说，真抱歉，我忘了你的名字。
[00:33:10.370] But I like I swear I remember who you are. And then you just like they say their name and you quickly move on to like whatever conversation you wanted to have from there. That awkwardness is long forgotten. Maybe the reunion is kind of a safe space for these awkward interactions because so many people probably forgot their high school classmates, but maybe remembered what setting they met them and whatnot. But I do remember being at your reunion and like hearing all these conversations around me.
[00:33:10.370] 但我发誓我记得你是谁。然后就像他们说出自己的名字一样，你们很快就能聊到自己想聊的话题了。那种尴尬早就被抛诸脑后了。也许同学聚会对这种尴尬的互动来说是个安全的空间，因为很多人可能都忘了高中同学，但或许还记得当初相遇的场景等等。但我确实记得参加你们的同学聚会，也记得周围那些嘈杂的谈话声。
[00:33:37.370] And in the beginning, like the first 30 minutes, even though I wasn't a participant in these conversations, that was like grueling. I was like, holy fuck, this is so awkward. So many people going like, oh, Daniel? No, no, that's not my name. Like it's Samuel. You know, like that times like 20. Have you guys ever like run into the situation where kind of similar to the high school reunion, except it's out of the safe space that Jisoo was talking about?
[00:33:37.370] 一开始，大概前30分钟，即使我没参与这些对话，也感觉很煎熬。我当时就想，我的天，这也太尴尬了吧。好多人会说，哦，丹尼尔？不不，那不是我的名字。我叫塞缪尔。你知道，这种情况大概会持续20次。你们有没有遇到过类似的情况，有点像高中同学聚会，只不过这次不在智秀说的那种安全空间里？
[00:34:05.930] You're like back in your hometown and you're like in a Target or something. And you see someone who, you know, they know you and you know them. But you guys weren't like even friends in high school. But like you know for sure that you know each other and you're like making eye contact and stuff like that. Like how would you play that? Yeah. Like how would you play off that situation? Okay. If you're making eye contact, I think you just you have to go up to them and be like, hey, or at the very least, like give a knowing nod or something. What type of eye contact is it?
[00:34:05.930] 你回到家乡，在Target之类的超市里。你看到一个人，你知道，你们彼此认识。但你们高中时甚至算不上朋友。但你确信你们认识对方，你们还眼神交流了。你会怎么处理这种情况？是啊。你会怎么应对这种情况？好吧。如果你们眼神交流了，我觉得你应该走过去打个招呼，或者至少点点头什么的。这是哪种眼神交流呢？
[00:34:33.790] Is it like you guys are holding it or is it like when you drive up next to you drive up next to somebody? Because I'm thinking of it like when you're driving and you drive up next to someone, like staring them down and cross. Well, you know, I think the best case scenario is you kind of make eye contact for a split second and then you play it off as a double take. You're like, oh my God. Hey, like so good to see you. Yeah. So that's what's happened more than once.
[00:34:33.790] 你们是故意跟对方对视，还是像开车靠近别人时那样？因为我想到的是开车靠近别人时，你们互相盯着对方看，然后互相穿过对方的视线。嗯，你知道，我觉得最好的情况是你们的目光短暂交汇，然后你装作是愣了一下。你会说，我的天哪。嘿，见到你真高兴。是的。这种情况不止一次发生过。
[00:35:02.650] I think pretty common to see people that like you went to school with. Yeah, definitely not like prolonged eye contact. I feel like I'd be really comfortable from both parties. But both sides are kind of like checking to see if it is like who they think it is. And then, yeah, if you like big eye contact, then you kind of just have to go up and strike up a conversation. Agree. This doesn't happen to me anymore now that we're like old farts and we're just, you know, not as relevant.
[00:35:02.650] 我觉得遇到以前的同学挺常见的。嗯，肯定不会长时间眼神交流。我觉得双方都会觉得很自在。但双方都会有点儿打量对方，看看是不是自己想的那个人。然后，如果你喜欢眼神交流，那就只能主动上前搭讪了。同意。现在我们都老了，没那么重要了，所以这种情况已经很少发生了。
[00:35:27.450] But back when I had just graduated high school, everyone would always go back to this one like boba place. And that was like the spot, right? Like you would see everyone from high school there. And then I would like occasionally go back and like grab drinks and whatnot. But after like my second or third year of college, I like do not step foot in that facility anymore. I'm like, I don't even want to risk seeing anyone, which now it's been so far along since high school, like I doubt I would really run into anyone.
[00:35:27.450] 但想当年我刚高中毕业的时候，大家总是会去一家奶茶店。那地方简直就是个聚集地，对吧？高中同学几乎都会在那里碰面。后来我偶尔也会去，喝点东西什么的。但到了大学二三年级之后，我就再也没去过那家店了。我感觉自己都不想冒碰到任何人的风险，而且现在离高中毕业都这么久了，估计也不太可能碰到谁了。
[00:35:56.270] But on the off chance that I could, I just straight up don't go there anymore. Dude, I ran into someone at Costco recently. That's how you know we're old. But actually, I didn't even see them. They came up to me and were like, oh, my God, Crystal. And I was like, oh, my God, hi. I did have a really big regret, though, when I bumped into this old classmate because I definitely know his name and like who he is. And we were like friends in high school.
[00:35:56.270] 但万一可以的话，我干脆就不去那儿了。哥们儿，我最近在Costco碰到一个人。这说明我们都老了。其实我根本没看见他。他走过来跟我说：“我的天哪，Crystal！”然后我就说：“我的天哪，你好。”不过，我倒是有点后悔，因为我碰到了一个老同学，我肯定知道他的名字，也挺喜欢他的。我们高中时可是好朋友呢。
[00:36:25.790] But throughout that entire interaction, I didn't say his name once. And I was with my boyfriend. So at one point, I even like turned to my boyfriend was like, oh, this is my boyfriend. And they introduced each other to each other. And I was like, dude, this totally looks like I didn't know his name. And I like scapegoated with my like boyfriend to like get his name. But I should have just started out with like, hi, ex. So, yeah, that lingered in my mind for a few days.
[00:36:25.790] 但在那整个过程中，我一次都没提过他的名字。而且当时我和我男朋友在一起。所以有那么一刻，我甚至还转头跟我男朋友说：“哦，这是我男朋友。”然后他们互相介绍了一下。我当时就想，老兄，这看起来完全像是我不知道他的名字。我当时就想，我男朋友是不是故意找茬问他名字。但我应该一开始就直接说：“嗨，前任。”所以，这件事在我脑海里萦绕了好几天。
[00:36:51.130] Wait, Crystal, on the on the topic of using your boyfriend as a scapegoat, that's such a crazy good tech to like get names. There's definitely been situations where I've like brought a mutual to like an event. I don't know some of the people like I know them, but I don't forget their names. And I was like, oh, everyone, meet my friends, X, Y. And then they'll go around and introduce themselves individually. And I'll just be like creeping on the side listening for the names. And I'll be like, ah, that's that's who you are. Yeah.
[00:36:51.130] 等等，Crystal，说到用你男朋友当替罪羊这个话题，这招用来套取名字真是太绝了。我以前也遇到过这种情况，带一个共同认识的人去参加活动。有些人我不太熟，但又记得他们的名字。然后我就说：“哦，各位，这是我的朋友，X，Y。” 然后他们就会一个个自我介绍。我就在旁边偷偷听，留意他们说的名字。然后我就恍然大悟：“啊，原来你是谁啊。” 对啊。
[00:37:19.710] But sometimes when I see people do that, I'm like, yeah, this person definitely doesn't know the other person's name. You think you're slick? I was so regretful after. I didn't know other people did this, too. This is like the college party trick. You know, this is like what I discovered for like freshman year of college. And I thought I was like the smartest person ever. Yeah. Like, oh, have you met my friends, by the way? And you just like listen real closely as they reintroduce themselves.
[00:37:19.710] 但有时候我看到有人这么做，就会想，这人肯定不知道对方的名字。你以为你很聪明吗？事后我真是后悔死了。我以前都不知道别人也这么做。这简直就是大学派对上的小把戏。你知道，我大一的时候才发现这个。当时我还觉得自己聪明绝顶呢。是啊。比如，对了，你见过我的朋友吗？然后你就得仔细听他们重新介绍自己。
[00:37:46.830] I literally remember I brought Brian to like a house party recently. And that's literally what I used. There's like six people there. And I was like, yeah, I don't fucking remember them. Well, Brian, do you feel used? Yeah. They totally just manipulated me under the guise of friendship. Dude, but on this topic of older friends from like, you know, high school or maybe even college where you were close at one point, but now you're you've grown apart.
[00:37:46.830] 我真的记得前不久带布莱恩去参加一个家庭聚会。我就是这么想的。当时大概有六个人。然后我就说，哎，我真不记得他们了。布莱恩，你觉得自己被利用了吗？是啊。他们完全是打着友谊的幌子操纵我。哥们，说到这种老朋友，比如高中甚至大学时的朋友，你们曾经很亲密，但现在却疏远了。
[00:38:17.410] Would you categorize that friendship as almost it reset like a factory reset, I guess? And now they're they're more of a, you know, in that you kind of know them, you kind of don't. Or would you say there's still like a close friend that you just need to like catch up with? I think there are certain people who I used to be really close with. And now after high school, you drifted apart. When I see them, it's definitely more like mutual friend type of vibe.
[00:38:17.410] 你会把那段友谊形容成几乎像恢复出厂设置一样重新开始吗？现在他们之间的关系更像是……你知道的，既熟悉又陌生。或者你会说，你仍然和他们保持着亲密的关系，只是需要好好叙叙旧？我觉得我以前和一些人关系非常亲密。但高中毕业后，我们就渐渐疏远了。现在我见到他们，感觉更像是普通朋友之间的那种感觉。
[00:38:45.030] I don't know if it's a little weird feeling, though, because sometimes when their pictures come up, it'll be like, oh, dude, I'm so glad he's doing well. Like, I wish only the best for him. Like, even though we're not like close, close anymore. When I see him, it's more like we're acquaintances. But all the memories of the past are still there. Damn. It's like a very particular and like weird situation, I think, because so I also had this come up recently where I hung out with two friends and one of them I still keep in contact with a lot.
[00:38:45.030] 我不知道这算不算一种很奇怪的感觉，因为有时候看到他们的照片，我会想，哦，老兄，真替他高兴，他现在过得好。我真心希望他一切都好。虽然我们现在不像以前那么亲密了，见面也只是点头之交。但所有过去的回忆都还在。唉。我觉得这是一种很特别也很奇怪的情况，因为我最近也遇到过类似的情况，我和两个朋友一起出去玩，其中一个朋友我现在还经常联系。
[00:39:12.850] And the other one, we were like really close in high school and for a few years in college. But she moved to the East Coast and we just kind of naturally drifted. So when we were hanging out, it kind of felt like I didn't know her anymore. But it's it was kind of weird because at the same time, like I know so much about her or we've had like so many times together. But the last like five to seven years, we weren't really in each other's life. So it kind of felt in some ways even more awkward than talking to like a mutual friend that you
[00:39:12.850] 另一个朋友，我们高中时关系特别好，大学也保持了几年联系。但她搬去了东海岸，我们自然而然就疏远了。所以当我们再次见面时，感觉好像我已经不认识她了。这感觉很奇怪，因为同时，我对她又了解很多，我们一起度过了很多时光。但在过去的五到七年里，我们几乎不出现在彼此的生活中。所以，在某种程度上，这种感觉甚至比和共同的朋友聊天还要尴尬。
[00:39:42.850] don't know at all. Because I think both of you like know that at one point you're really close. So there's almost this expectation to try to rehash it a little bit, but it's just not really it doesn't always work out like that. So, yeah, I think it's both the expectation and also the fact that when you guys are gone for that long, especially since we're still in our 20s, five years is you can change a lot in five years. Five years is longer than high school. It's like longer than college potentially to just like you don't share as much in common
[00:39:42.850] 完全不知道。因为我觉得你们俩都知道，曾经你们关系非常亲密。所以大家几乎都期待着能重温一下旧时光，但事实并非总是如此。所以，我觉得这既是因为大家的期待，也是因为你们分开这么久，尤其我们现在都还不到30岁，五年时间足以改变很多事情。五年比高中还长，甚至比大学还长，所以你们之间的共同点可能就没那么多了。
[00:40:12.330] as you used to. Like I was on the West Coast this whole time. She was on the East Coast. Just we don't really keep in contact with like the same people anymore. So there's like the relatability factor that's honestly like gone down a lot, which is pretty important for I think being able to maintain friendships that you don't see very often, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, it's tough. I guess I kind of see friendship as a max rank, whatever maximum your friendship was. That's kind of like the legacy would always stay at past a certain age.
[00:40:12.330] 就像以前那样。我这段时间一直待在西海岸，她待在东海岸。我们现在和以前那些人联系少了很多。所以，那种亲近感真的下降了很多，我觉得这对于维持那些不常见面的友谊来说很重要。是啊，确实很难。我觉得友谊就像一个最高等级，无论你们的友谊曾经达到过什么程度，它都会一直停留在某个阶段。
[00:40:40.690] If you're really close friends with someone in college, even if you drift apart, that friendship isn't any less meaningful. Maybe it's just like faded, you know? Dude, to add on to that, it's like in competitive games where you have like ranks, you have decay if you don't play for a while. Yeah, your friendship decay. Damn. No longer on your top friends list. No, but definitely I think my favorite friendships are, I guess they're like low maintenance friends.
[00:40:40.690] 如果你在大学里和某人是特别要好的朋友，即使你们渐渐疏远，这段友谊的意义也不会因此而减弱。也许只是淡化了，你知道吗？哥们，补充一下，这就像竞技游戏里有段位一样，如果你一段时间不玩，段位就会下降。没错，友谊也会衰减。唉。不再是你的好友列表里的重要成员了。不过，我最喜欢的友谊，我觉得应该是那种不需要费心维护的朋友。
[00:41:07.610] This is like probably a completely different topic, but it's people who you could literally not see for like years. And then you see them and you can just like pick up where you left off. I totally agree with that sentiment. But when thinking a little deeper about those kinds of friendships, I feel like there's two important factors. One is when that friendship was first made. I feel like that affects that feeling of like you can pick it up whenever because maybe when
[00:41:07.610] 这可能完全是另一个话题了，但这里指的是那些你可能好几年都见不到的人。然后你们再次相遇，感觉就像从未分开过一样。我完全同意这种感受。但更深入地思考这类友谊时，我觉得有两个重要因素。一是这段友谊最初建立的时间。我觉得这会影响到那种“随时都能继续”的感觉，因为也许当……
[00:41:35.150] it was made, you already had that in place where you didn't see them every single day. And so the building blocks of that friendship can maintain strong because that's what it was built on. And then I think the second factor is there might still actually be an eventual limit. Maybe that kind of friendship just has a longer limit that you don't have to see them. You know, maybe it's like two to three years. But once it hits like, for example, five years, then you're like, oh, shoot.
[00:41:35.150] 这种友谊已经建立起来了，你们不必每天都见面。因此，这种友谊的基石能够保持牢固，因为它正是建立在这种不见面的基础上的。我认为第二个因素是，这种友谊最终可能还是会有一个极限。也许这种友谊的极限只是你们不必每天都见面。你知道，也许是两三年。但一旦到了五年，比如说，你就会想，哎呀，糟糕。
[00:42:04.910] Actually, I probably know less about them than I thought I did at this point. That's valid. Just a working theory, though. Sounds like a warning for Jonathan. You better hit that, Brenda. I feel like Crystal articulated that so well. I was like, she must have been thinking about this. Yeah, you gave like a dissertation. You're like, just a theory. I'd be okay, though. Yeah, actually, it was my thesis.
[00:42:04.910] 其实，我现在对他们的了解可能比我想象的还要少。这倒也说得通。不过，这只是个初步的推测。听起来像是给乔纳森的警告。布伦达，你最好说到做到。我觉得克丽丝特尔把这一点表达得非常清楚。我当时就想，她肯定一直在思考这个问题。是啊，你简直像在写论文。你就像是在说，这只是个推测而已。不过，我应该没问题。是啊，实际上，这就是我的论文。
[00:42:34.370] Yeah, but that's just me. Yeah, that's just me, though. I think at the end of the day, my perspective is that someone you were once really close with, that never fades. There's like someone I see from time to time. That person and I used to be like super close friends. And when I see that person still, I feel like it feels very normal. We're not like having the most deep conversations or anything, but I'll still know what kinds of things this person likes or what kind of interest they might have.
[00:42:34.370] 是啊，不过这只是我个人的看法。是啊，不过这只是我个人的看法。我觉得归根结底，我的观点是，你曾经非常亲近的人，那种感觉永远不会消失。就像我偶尔会见到的那个人。我和那个人以前是超级要好的朋友。当我再次见到那个人时，感觉一切都很正常。我们不会进行什么深入的对话，但我仍然知道那个人喜欢什么，或者他们有什么兴趣爱好。
[00:43:04.030] I think all in all, it's better than just a mutual friend. You might not know them as well as you once did, but because you once knew them so well, it still like counts for something. Yeah. Yeah, I think that makes sense. Like it won't ever turn into nothing, basically. And the comfort and stuff is still there. Like you can be like quiet around them and it'll feel fine. Yeah. Have you guys ever had any funny instances of seeing someone where you kind of knew?
[00:43:04.030] 我觉得总的来说，这比普通朋友好多了。你可能不像以前那么了解他们了，但因为曾经很熟，所以这种关系仍然很重要。嗯，我觉得有道理。基本上，这种关系永远不会消失。那种熟悉感和亲近感依然存在。比如，你可以在他们面前保持安静，也不会觉得不舒服。嗯。你们有没有遇到过那种似曾相识的有趣情况？
[00:43:32.350] Oh God, it's my time to shine. So the story is like a little cringe and I haven't thought about this in a long time. Like today's the first time I've thought about it in a while. Basically, there was this one time where it was a friend's birthday dinner. So they were like, oh, I want to go grab dinner at this one restaurant. And it was like a big group thing. I think maybe like 10 or 12 of us like gathered around this big table at that restaurant and everyone's just like chatting amongst themselves. We haven't ordered anything yet.
[00:43:32.350] 哦，天哪，轮到我出场了。这事儿有点尴尬，我好久都没想起来了。今天是我好久以来第一次想起它。事情是这样的，有一次朋友过生日，我们聚餐。他们说，哦，我想去一家餐厅吃晚饭。当时人很多，大概有十来个人，围坐在餐厅的一张大桌子旁，大家都在聊天。我们还没点菜呢。
[00:44:02.270] Our waitress walks in and I look up and I was like, oh shit. It's like a familiar face because literally the year prior, I had gone on this tour group travel thing. I like went to Europe with my mom and we had booked this Korean tour group. So then we were like traveling around Europe with a group of like 30 or 40 other people. And she and I were like similar age. So we like chatted a little bit during the tour, but nothing crazy. We weren't like besties or anything. It was just like a couple of conversations here and there.
[00:44:02.270] 我们的女服务员走了进来，我抬头一看，心想：糟了。这面孔好眼熟啊，因为就在去年，我参加了一个旅行团。我和我妈一起去了欧洲，我们报的是一个韩国旅行团。然后我们就和大概三四十个人一起在欧洲到处逛。我和她年纪差不多，所以在旅行途中我们聊过几句，但也没什么特别的。我们算不上闺蜜什么的，就是偶尔聊上几句而已。
[00:44:32.490] And she had walked in at that restaurant as our waitress. When I looked up, she also recognized me. So everyone kind of stopped talking or like looking over at us. And in my like state of panic, she was like, hi, oh my God. And I was like, hi, nice to meet you. Oh no. And after I said that, I was like, holy fucks. I could feel my entire body like flush red. Like my face was like hot, like on fire.
[00:44:32.490] 她走进那家餐厅时，是我们餐厅的服务员。我抬头一看，她也认出了我。于是大家都停止了交谈，或者说都看向我们。我当时有点慌乱，她突然说：“嗨，我的天哪。” 我也说：“嗨，很高兴认识你。” 哦不。说完之后，我感觉自己浑身通红，脸像着火了一样，热得像着了火一样。
[00:45:02.370] And then she was like, yeah, it's so good to see you. And then she like walked away. And after that, I was like, I need to destroy this memory somehow. Like I don't want to hold this in my brain anymore. Wait, so did you never clarify to her that you actually do remember her? No, I said, hi, nice to meet you in the intonation of like, oh my God, it's so good to see you. Except the words coming out of my mouth were, hi, it's nice to meet you. I see. And we like, you know, like shook hands or kind of like held hands or whatever.
[00:45:02.370] 然后她就说，是啊，见到你真好。然后她就走开了。之后我就想，我得想办法把这段记忆抹去。我不想再让它留在我的脑海里了。等等，所以你从来没跟她说过你其实记得她？没有，我说“你好，很高兴见到你”，语气就像是“天哪，见到你真好”。只不过我嘴里说出来的是“你好，很高兴见到你”。我明白了。然后我们就握了握手，或者牵了牵手什么的。
[00:45:31.170] But yeah, it was like super cringe. And that actually is going to start haunting me, like keeping me up at night now that I re-remembered this memory. We'll be staring at the ceiling walls. How could I do her like that? Wait, oh my God. I kind of remember a like pretty embarrassing story. I recovered decently from it. It was actually at my reunion and there was someone who I was talking with.
[00:45:31.170] 是啊，那真是尴尬到不行。而且这件事现在真的会一直困扰我，让我夜不能寐，因为我又想起来了。我们会盯着天花板和墙壁发呆。我怎么能那样对她呢？等等，我的天哪。我好像想起了一件挺尴尬的事。不过我后来还算缓过来了。那是在我的同学聚会上，当时我正在和一个人聊天。
[00:45:58.570] She actually also went to our high school, but she was a different grade. And so she came as a plus one to the event. I knew her. I had a class with her. But at first it didn't register. And she was talking to me like she knew me. But I was like, oh, you know, this is just like a high school reunion, I guess. I actually don't even know what I was thinking. But at some point I was like, wait, like coming to realize mid conversation, like I know this person. And I remember their name.
[00:45:58.570] 她其实也是我们高中的同学，不过我们年级不一样。所以她是作为同学的陪同来参加活动的。我认识她，我们上过同一门课。但一开始我并没有意识到。她跟我说话的语气就像认识我一样。我当时想，哦，这大概就是个高中同学聚会吧。我其实都不知道自己当时在想什么。但聊着聊着，我突然意识到，等等，我认识这个人。而且我记得她的名字。
[00:46:27.790] I remember the class we had. I remember like my life with her flashed before my eyes. My life with her is crazy. Or her moments in my life flashed before my eyes. And I was like, dude, how do I recover from this? So I feel like there must have been a moment like she must have noticed because it clicked in my mind.
[00:46:27.790] 我记得我们上的那堂课。我记得，就像我和她在一起的时光在我眼前闪过一样。我和她在一起的生活简直太疯狂了。或者说，她在我生命中的那些瞬间在我眼前闪过。我当时就想，天哪，我该怎么从这一切中走出来？所以我觉得，肯定有那么一刻，她察觉到了什么，因为我突然明白了。
[00:46:56.950] And then I like started asking her relevant questions about like our experiences in high school and stuff. And later I was like, OK, I think I like kind of recovered there. But I think the first like five minutes was probably just terrible. Do you think she knew the whole time that dude, like when she came up to talk to you, did she know? She definitely knew who I was. Chris crystals is giving her like low ball small talk questions like weather.
[00:46:56.950] 然后我就开始问她一些关于我们高中经历之类的相关问题。后来我觉得，好吧，我好像缓过来了。但我觉得最初的五分钟可能真的糟透了。你觉得她一直都知道我是谁吗？就像她走过来跟你说话的时候，她知道吗？她肯定知道我是谁。克里斯·克里斯特尔问了她一些很无聊的闲聊问题，比如天气。
[00:47:24.310] And halfway through, she's like, dude, do you remember when we talked about like this deep discussion in X class? Wait, it was literally something like that. So I was like, fuck, dude, she definitely knows. OK, it's OK. Safe space. Safe space. Yeah, you know, my fumble is probably I ask questions that were a little too specific later. Just overcorrected way too long.
[00:47:24.310] 聊到一半，她突然说：“哥们儿，你还记得我们在X课上讨论过的那次深入对话吗？”等等，好像就是这么回事儿。我当时就想，卧槽，她肯定记得。好吧，没事儿。安全空间。安全空间。嗯，你知道，我这次失误可能是后来问了一些太具体的问题。结果矫枉过正了，花了太长时间才反应过来。
[00:47:53.130] Hey, Crystal, I know that feeling. You know, it does make me feel better that we all in our own ways have some anxieties or fears or maybe even embarrassing stories about running into people you kind of know kind of don't. So thank you, Brian and Jonathan today for coming to chat about a slightly vulnerable part of our lives.
[00:47:53.130] 嘿，克丽丝塔尔，我懂你的感受。你知道吗，知道我们每个人都会以自己的方式感到焦虑、恐惧，甚至可能有一些尴尬的经历，比如遇到那些似曾相识又不太熟悉的人，这让我感觉好多了。所以，布莱恩和乔纳森，感谢你们今天来和我聊聊我们生活中这有点脆弱的一面。
