[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. So I feel like I want to say we're back on that bullshit because we are potentially having crises
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我觉得我想说的是，我们又开始胡扯了，因为我们可能正面临危机。
[00:00:25.420] again and catastrophizing, but we thought we would talk about how do we deal with these times of high stress or just like unrest, I guess, could also be another way to describe it. I feel like especially this year, we have been feeling like a similar issue, which is we're just so busy. Sometimes it's hard to get a moment to yourself. Do you ever feel like your emotions get out of control during
[00:00:25.420] 又一次陷入了灾难化的思维模式，但我们想聊聊如何应对这种高压时期，或者说，动荡不安的时期，我想，用“动荡不安”来形容也未尝不可。我觉得尤其今年，我们都面临着类似的问题，那就是我们太忙了。有时候很难抽出一点时间独处。你是否也曾感觉自己的情绪在某个时刻失控？
[00:00:54.600] these kinds of times or any other sort of catastrophe? Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. Feels like we haven't had a chance to stop and take a breather this year. But in general, I consider myself someone who will from time to time have like a mini catastrophe. And one of the things that I experienced recently was actually like a mini health anxiety episode where I convinced
[00:00:54.600] 这种时期或者其他任何类型的灾难？嗯，我觉得你说得太对了。感觉今年我们都没机会停下来喘口气。但总的来说，我觉得自己时不时会遇到一些小灾难。我最近经历的一件事，其实就是一次小小的健康焦虑发作，我当时说服了别人……
[00:01:21.640] myself after hours and hours of research online that I had this major problem. After canceling all my plans for that weekend and going to see the doctor a couple times, it was concluded that it was not, in fact, anything dangerous. And it was just like some sort of normal thing that happened. So when I was going through my health episode, I had this moment where I felt like my emotions were
[00:01:21.640] 经过几个小时的网上搜索，我发现自己遇到了一个大问题。我取消了周末的所有计划，还去看了几次医生，最终的结论是这其实没什么危险，就像某种正常现象一样。所以，在我经历这段健康危机的时候，我感觉自己的情绪……
[00:01:47.260] whirling around me like a tornado. And even though I could sense that I was having like a mini panic attack, my heart rate was really fast. I felt like I wasn't taking deep breaths. And my vision was starting to get almost fuzzy and like staticky. It was still hard for me to pull myself out of that. Hmm. Dude, that's such a good way of describing it. I feel like the description of your emotions
[00:01:47.260] 感觉像龙卷风一样在我周围旋转。虽然我能感觉到自己像是要经历一次轻微的恐慌发作，但我的心跳却很快。我感觉自己呼吸很急促。我的视线开始变得模糊，像有雪花点一样。我很难从那种状态中挣脱出来。嗯，兄弟，你这描述太贴切了。我觉得你对自身情绪的描述非常到位。
[00:02:11.620] whirling around you is so true. I think in those moments, I literally feel like I've lost control. Yeah. I'm lost in the sauce. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just like floating. Yeah. And I don't know. I think everyone has their own sort of coping mechanisms. For me, I tend to process my emotions very externally. So a lot of that, like taking control of my emotions
[00:02:11.620] 那种感觉就像在你周围旋转，真是太对了。我觉得在那些时刻，我真的感觉自己完全失控了。是啊，我迷失在情绪里，不知道自己在干什么，就像在漂浮一样。是啊，我也不知道。我觉得每个人都有自己的应对机制。对我来说，我倾向于用很外在的方式来处理我的情绪。所以很多时候，比如控制自己的情绪。
[00:02:35.740] again process looks like phone calls with people or, you know, texting people about my thoughts and emotions. And that of course goes hand in hand with, I have to map out my escape plan if the worst case scenario happened. And then if I feel like even in the worst case scenario, it's still kind of okay, then I start to calm down. Dude. Okay. I'm also similar where I need to come up with a plan.
[00:02:35.740] 这个过程看起来就像是跟人打电话，或者发短信倾诉我的想法和感受。当然，这其中也少不了制定一个应对最坏情况的计划。如果我觉得即使在最糟糕的情况下，一切也还可以接受，那我就会开始冷静下来。哥们儿，好吧。我也一样，需要制定一个计划。
[00:03:03.580] I think it's funny too, because coming up with plans is not necessarily a huge part of like what I do day to day, but I feel like it's the safety of knowing you have that escape plan. Dude, maybe it's just like fear of the unknown. Probably. It's scary to imagine us in a situation where we don't know what to do. So then we like shield our future selves by coming up with this like random plan. Yeah. I remember like one time I was abroad and I had a panic attack and I was
[00:03:03.580] 我也觉得挺搞笑的，因为制定计划并不是我日常生活中最重要的部分，但我觉得这就像知道自己有个退路，能给人一种安全感。哥们，也许这只是对未知的恐惧。很有可能。想象一下自己身处不知所措的境地，确实挺可怕的。所以我们才会想出这种随机的计划来保护未来的自己。是啊。我记得有一次我在国外，突然恐慌发作，然后……
[00:03:33.220] really, really freaking out. And I was also alone at the time. So I was like, oh my God, I don't know what to do. I can't just like randomly hit someone up because of time difference as well. Right. So what I ended up doing was I literally sat down and I logged on to like my health portal or whatever my like doctor portal thing is. And I made an appointment right then and there, even though it was like, dude, I think it was like two months later because it's so hard to get them right away.
[00:03:33.220] 当时我真的吓坏了。而且那时候我一个人。所以我就想，天哪，我不知道该怎么办。而且因为时差的关系，我也不能随便找个人帮忙。对吧。所以我最后就坐下来，登录了我的健康门户网站或者其他什么医生门户网站。然后我立刻就预约了，虽然，老兄，我觉得大概过了两个月才轮到我，因为现在很难马上预约到医生。
[00:04:02.920] But even though it was two months later that like immediately calmed me, I was like, okay, you know, action has been taken. Now we just have to get to the doctor, survive the next few days, the next two months and get to the doctor. Oh my God. I totally feel that. Like you said, it's not always like the most practical thing that ends up saving you from your own emotion. That appointment you made or once I was having this negative thought spiral of something about
[00:04:02.920] 但即便两个月后才让我真正平静下来，我当时想，好吧，你知道，行动已经采取了。现在我们只需要去看医生，熬过接下来的几天、两个月，然后去看医生。我的天哪。我完全理解你的感受。就像你说的，最终让你摆脱情绪的，并不总是最实际的事情。你帮我预约的那个，或者有一次我陷入了关于某件事的负面情绪漩涡中……
[00:04:31.260] like interpersonal relationships, basically. In order to snap myself out of it, I had to basically create this fake scenario in my head and have like a whole play out of that scenario, like while I was in the shower. And it's just so like meaningless, right? Like that doesn't really do anything. There's no like practical application, but I think even just having that like fake conversation or having that fake scenario play out, I was like, oh, I'm like over this. This is not as big of a deal as I thought 20 minutes ago, basically. Damn, you're writing novels in your head.
[00:04:31.260] 基本上就是人际关系之类的。为了让自己摆脱这种状态，我不得不在脑子里虚构一个场景，然后把它完整地演绎一遍，比如在洗澡的时候。这其实毫无意义，对吧？根本没什么用。也没有什么实际应用价值，但我觉得即使只是进行这种虚构的对话或者让这种虚构的场景上演，我也会想，哦，我终于释怀了。这事儿其实没我20分钟前想的那么严重。哎，你脑子里都快写小说了。
[00:05:02.400] I don't know. Maybe I just need to know what happens in every scenario. Did you ever read those choose your own adventure books when you were young? Yes. So every time I would make a decision, I would go back and read what the other path would have done so that I know what the opportunity cost is. And sometimes I wish you could do that with life and just like see how everything maps out. Same. I would choose one path and be like, okay, now I have to reread, but I have to choose the
[00:05:02.400] 我不知道。也许我只是想知道每种情况下会发生什么。你小时候读过那种“选择你自己的冒险”系列丛书吗？读过。所以每次我做决定的时候，我都会回头看看另一条路会怎么样，这样我就知道机会成本是多少了。有时候我真希望人生也能这样，看看一切最终会如何发展。我也是。我会选择一条路，然后想，好吧，现在我得重新读一遍，但我必须选择……
[00:05:27.300] other path and see what happens. Exactly. I think it's also for me, taking action helps maybe like ground everything a little bit. You're like, I did what I could in the moment. And so, you know, maybe for you, that means like you acted out the scenario. And then like, you know, in my example where I've made this appointment, even though it's like two, three months out, it's just, I did what I could. I think you're right. Also just about maybe breaking that negative
[00:05:27.300] 换条路走，看看会发生什么。没错。我觉得对我来说，采取行动也能让一切更脚踏实地一些。你会想，我已经尽力了。所以，你知道，也许对你来说，这意味着你把事情模拟了一遍。然后，你知道，就像我举的例子，我预约了这个，虽然还有两三个月的时间，但我只是尽力了。我觉得你说得对。还有，也许也能打破那种消极情绪。
[00:05:57.060] thought spiral. Sometimes when you're not doing anything and taking action, the alternative that I'm doing is freaking out or doing more research or, you know, just like continuing in the same thought loop that like trapped me in this position in the first place. So maybe a part of it too, is just like doing what you can to break out of that cycle. Cause it can be hard. Sometimes I think the same, like four thoughts are on repeat in my head and I'm just tortured by that.
[00:05:57.060] 思维螺旋。有时候，当你什么都不做，不采取任何行动时，我就会像现在这样焦虑不安，或者做更多研究，或者，你知道的，只是继续陷入那个让我陷入困境的思维循环。所以，也许其中一部分原因在于，你要尽一切努力打破这个循环。因为这可能很难。有时候，我脑子里会反复出现同样的几个想法，让我备受折磨。
[00:06:22.840] Dude, I know what you mean. Dude, is this just fight or flight in a different context? Like fighting is taking action and flighting is, I don't know, spiraling, I guess. Ooh, honestly, I wonder if the other way to act in a catastrophe is also just like avoidance. I don't know if you've experienced this before, but sometimes when something is really stressing me
[00:06:22.840] 兄弟，我懂你的意思。兄弟，这不就是换了种情境下的战斗或逃跑反应吗？战斗是采取行动，而逃跑，嗯，我也不知道，大概是陷入恶性循环吧。说真的，我在想，在灾难面前的另一种应对方式是不是也跟逃避差不多。我不知道你有没有过这种经历，但有时候，当事情真的让我压力很大的时候……
[00:06:49.240] out, I will try my entire absolute best to not think about it, which depending on what it is, isn't always the best thing to do. So maybe that's the flight. I don't know what spiraling would be. Oh, it's freeze. Oh, wait, you're right. I think you're completely right in this scenario. I have also definitely just
[00:06:49.240] 出去之后，我会尽我所能不去想它，但根据事情的性质，这并不总是最好的办法。所以也许这就是飞行。我不知道“螺旋式下降”是什么意思。哦，是“冻结”。哦，等等，你说得对。我觉得在这种情况下你是完全正确的。我也肯定刚刚
[00:07:11.000] avoided something so hard. It's like disassociating or like finding some distraction to like get absorbed into for the next, I don't know, week, month, like rotting on the couch, scrolling through TikTok or like putting on some random show so that you don't have to think about whatever it is that's bothering you. And I feel like actually that sometimes puts me in more of a funk though,
[00:07:11.000] 逃避这件事太难了。就像是抽离现实，或者找点事情分散注意力，让自己沉浸其中，接下来的几周、几个月，比如瘫在沙发上，刷刷TikTok，或者随便找个节目看看，这样就不用去想那些烦心事了。但我觉得，有时候这样做反而会让我更难过。
[00:07:40.060] because I guess like the emotions catch up later. You're just like, okay, well, I just, you know, was unproductive for two, three weeks trying to avoid this thing. And now I feel bad because not only did I not avoid it successfully, but I also just took shit care of myself. Right, dude. And I feel like that panic always comes at like 10 p.m. on a random night. And it's just a feeling that's so big that you can't go to sleep. And now you like sit up at your computer and
[00:07:40.060] 因为我觉得情绪会在之后慢慢涌上心头。你会想，好吧，我为了躲避这件事，整整两三个星期都碌碌无为。现在我感觉很糟糕，因为我不仅没能成功躲开，而且还完全没好好照顾自己。没错，兄弟。我觉得那种恐慌总是会在某个不知名的夜晚，比如晚上十点左右突然袭来。那种感觉太强烈了，让你根本睡不着。然后你就只能坐在电脑前，
[00:08:09.660] you like work on it like a crazy person for four hours. And you're like, why didn't I just do this at a normal time like two weeks ago? Yes, I completely agree. Staying up late at night is one of my greatest vices. Do you think that's like the number one way that you deal with being overwhelmed? Like, do you try to carve out alone time or block out everything that's stressing you out by staying up
[00:08:09.660] 你会像疯了一样连续工作四个小时。然后你会想，为什么我两周前没在正常时间做这件事呢？是的，我完全同意。熬夜是我最大的恶习之一。你觉得这是你应对压力过大的主要方式吗？比如，你会尝试挤出独处的时间，还是会通过熬夜来屏蔽所有让你感到压力的事情？
[00:08:35.360] late? Yes, which is so bad because usually I need alone time. I need like, you know, a weekend or two to myself at least here and there. And the biggest part about these weekends is I need to get enough sleep or else I'm just like a grumpy rat all week long. And so the issue is like, if I'm not getting that
[00:08:35.360] 晚了吗？是的，这太糟糕了，因为我通常需要独处的时间。我需要，你知道，至少偶尔需要一两个周末的独处时间。而这些周末最重要的就是我需要充足的睡眠，否则我整个星期都会像只暴躁的老鼠一样。所以问题是，如果我得不到足够的睡眠……
[00:08:59.200] alone time, I guess I've heard it called like revenge procrastination, where it's like you fight for your own alone time by sacrificing sleep, for example. You know, usually you're doing just mindless stuff. And so by sacrificing sleep to like carve out whatever alone time I can get, it's like doing the opposite of what it should be doing. Dude, it's so hard. I always watch those TikToks where it's like, oh, when you're stressed,
[00:08:59.200] 我听说有人把独处时间叫做“报复性拖延症”，好像是为了争取独处时间而牺牲睡眠之类的。你知道，通常情况下，你只是在做一些无脑的事情。所以，为了挤出一点独处时间而牺牲睡眠，这简直是本末倒置。老兄，这太难了。我总是看那些TikTok视频，里面说，当你压力很大的时候，
[00:09:29.060] instead of laying on the couch and eating potato chips, you should go on a walk. And I'm like, fuck no. That's like the last thing I want to do. Dude, and the worst part is when you, you know, finally pick yourself up and go to the gym or take a walk, you're like, wait, this is like so nice. You're like, they weren't lying. Dude, I don't know. I think one of my biggest challenges is breaking out of my
[00:09:29.060] 与其躺在沙发上吃薯片，不如出去走走。我心想，去他妈的，那简直是我最不想做的事。哥们儿，最糟糕的是，当你终于鼓起勇气去健身房或者出去散步的时候，你会觉得，等等，这感觉真好。你会觉得，他们说的没错。哥们儿，我也不知道。我觉得我最大的挑战之一就是摆脱……
[00:09:55.000] thought loops, of course, but also just leading into healthier coping mechanisms. And like you said, like going to the gym and stuff, it feels so much easier when you have that momentum going. But I think when you're in a really tough spot, where you feel like the world is caving in around you, it takes a lot in me to like even leave the house. And I really respect people who during their tough times, they still keep up with their routines. But for me, I feel like my healthiest habits are
[00:09:55.000] 当然，这其中也包括思维循环，但更重要的是培养更健康的应对机制。就像你说的，比如去健身房之类的，当你保持这种势头的时候，一切都会轻松很多。但我觉得，当你真的处境艰难，感觉世界末日就要来临的时候，我甚至需要很大的勇气才能出门。我真的很敬佩那些在困境中依然坚持日常作息的人。但对我来说，我觉得我最健康的习惯是……
[00:10:24.100] the first to go out the window. Oh my God. Wait, you're so right. Suddenly you just have no discipline. Yeah. It's that activation energy. It's too high. Well, I want to know actually like the full list of your coping mechanisms. And I want you to kind of sort them into two buckets. So like one is it something that feels good, but it's actually bad
[00:10:24.100] 第一个被扔出窗外的。我的天哪。等等，你说得太对了。突然间你就完全没有自律了。是啊。就是那种激活能量。太高了。嗯，我其实想知道你所有的应对机制。我想让你把它们分成两类。一类是感觉良好但实际上是有害的。
[00:10:51.140] for you. And the other is things that feel bad, but are actually good for you. Okay. Okay. So a quick and easy one for feels good, but it's actually bad. You know, accidentally just scrolling away until like five or 6am. Holy fuck. That's pretty late. Dude, it's pretty bad. And then I'll be like, oh my God, it's 6am. Oh, but what if, you know,
[00:10:51.140] 对你来说。还有一种情况是，感觉不好，但实际上对你有好处。好的。好的。举个简单快捷的例子，就是感觉很好，但实际上不好。你知道，就是不小心一直刷到凌晨五六点。我的天。这都多晚了。老兄，这太糟糕了。然后我就会想，哦我的天，都六点了。哦，但是如果，你知道，
[00:11:18.800] I just give myself another hour, like survive, right? Double check. Like when I have to wake up, the next, or actually that day, I guess. So that's a bad one because for some reason it also always happens on school nights. And I'm always like, I got to go to work. What am I doing? And the next day I'm just a shell of myself. And I'm like, why did I do that to myself? Yeah.
[00:11:18.800] 我只能再给自己一个小时，就当是撑过去了，对吧？再三确认。比如我第二天，或者其实就是当天，该起床的时候。这很糟糕，因为不知为何，这种情况总是发生在上学日的晚上。我总是会想，我得去上班。我这是在干什么？第二天我就完全变了个人。然后我就想，我为什么要这么折磨自己？唉。
[00:11:46.140] I feel like back in college, sometimes we would try to do the full reset. Like, oh, we're up till six anyway. Might as well stay up till 9pm. Dude, but that was when we were young and we could handle it. I feel like now staying up late, you really feel it in your bones. I know. Sleeping past like one, it kills me. Yeah. It's a lot. I think another one is knowing I have work to do
[00:11:46.140] 感觉以前上大学的时候，我们有时候会想彻底放松一下。比如，反正都要熬到六点，不如就熬到九点吧。哥们儿，那时候我们还年轻，还能应付。现在熬夜，感觉浑身都疼。我知道。睡过一点就累死了。是啊，真的太难熬了。还有就是知道自己还有工作要做。
[00:12:11.580] that is honestly not even that difficult and then just avoiding it. And then I end up like on the couch and watching TV. And then it's not even enjoyable to watch it, I think, because the panic starts to slowly rise. Yes. So yeah, I think a lot of the things that are just like feel good, but are actually bad are just avoiding the responsibilities and avoiding that
[00:12:11.580] 说实话，这其实并不难，但我就是选择逃避。然后我就瘫在沙发上看电视。我觉得看电视也变得索然无味了，因为恐慌感会慢慢袭来。是的。所以，我觉得很多感觉良好但实际上不好的事情，其实就是逃避责任和逃避现实。
[00:12:37.020] discipline. I guess it's like leaning in too hard on your emotions and trying to soothe that versus knowing to balance that with logic. Yeah. And so I guess like, you know, things that feel bad, but are actually good would just kind of be the opposite, right? Like getting up and, you know, doing that work so you know tomorrow you will feel a little better because today you
[00:12:37.020] 自律。我觉得这就像过度沉溺于情绪，试图安抚它，而不是懂得用理性来平衡。是的。所以我觉得，你知道，那些感觉不好但实际上是好事的事情，就应该反过来做，对吧？比如起床，你知道，去做那些工作，这样你知道明天你会感觉好一些，因为今天你……
[00:13:04.540] just sucked it up and like did the work. Right. How about you? I think for me, my biggest catastrophes are probably like the deep spiral thoughts that I mentioned. And I think what you said is right. One of my biggest coping mechanisms is allowing myself to feel it too much, you know, and like not hearing the logical side of my brain. So the health scare that I had, for example, instead of being like,
[00:13:04.540] 我就硬着头皮上了，然后继续干活。对吧。你呢？我觉得对我来说，最大的灾难可能就是我之前提到的那种深陷其中的胡思乱想。我觉得你说得对。我最大的应对机制之一就是让自己尽情地感受那些情绪，你知道，就是不去理会我理智的那一面。比如我之前那次健康危机，我没有像往常那样想，
[00:13:30.940] ah, well, I'm just like reading random threads online. It's anecdotal evidence and I have zero medical background and these people probably don't either. So I'll just wait for a professional to look at my stuff before I freak out. But instead I was like, oh my God, look at all these people online said like they're confirming that I have disease X and I only have, you know, whatever number of years to live. I need to just cut it off and not allow myself to like indulge in that.
[00:13:30.940] 啊，好吧，我只是随便看看网上的帖子。那些都是些道听途说，我一点医学背景都没有，这些人可能也不懂。所以我还是等专业人士看看我的资料再说吧。结果我当时就想，我的天哪，看看网上这些人，好像都在证实我得了X病，只剩下几年可活了。我得赶紧打消念头，不能让自己沉迷其中。
[00:13:59.460] But I think I just allow myself to go into it too deep. Dude, that totally fucking reminds me of, I sometimes get these Reddit suggested posts for, oh my God, I'm forgetting what the subreddit name is, but it's basically people posting some wound or like injury or yeah, health related thing. And they're like, is this bad? And sometimes
[00:13:59.460] 但我感觉我有点钻牛角尖了。老兄，这让我想起，我有时候会在Reddit上看到一些推荐帖子，哦天哪，我忘了是哪个子版块了，但基本上都是些人发帖说自己受伤、受伤或者其他健康方面的事情。然后他们会问，这严重吗？有时候
[00:14:26.800] it's like this red line that's like a sign of infection. And then the top comments are always like, stop posting on Reddit and just call your doctor or like go to the hospital. Why was your first thought to stop and post this on Reddit when you could have just like driven to the hospital urgent care or something? Right. Dude, I know. It's like there's a logical path forward, but I think it's just
[00:14:26.800] 就像一条红线，像是感染的标志。然后置顶评论总是说，别在Reddit上发帖了，直接打电话给医生或者去医院。你第一反应是停下来在Reddit上发帖，而不是直接开车去医院急诊什么的？是啊，兄弟，我知道。感觉好像有个合乎逻辑的解决办法，但我觉得只是……
[00:14:53.700] in some of us to like panic and freak out. Yeah. Or maybe it's about like wanting something instant response or something instead of waiting. That's true. Yeah. I feel like as a fellow hypochondriac, I'm definitely that way too, though. I'll like spend hours on the internet searching whatever is happening and then you're like, okay, so either I'm panicking or like I'm about to die.
[00:14:53.700] 我们有些人就是会恐慌，会惊慌失措。是啊。或者可能是因为想要立刻得到回应，而不是等待。没错。是啊。我觉得作为一个疑病症患者，我肯定也是这样。我会花好几个小时上网搜索各种信息，然后就会想，好吧，要么我是恐慌过度，要么我感觉自己快要死了。
[00:15:19.700] Yeah. Oh, dude, I know. And I think one of the things that I've realized about myself with this most recent health scare, and I think this applies to beyond just health anxiety and like a lot of things that I experience in life, I think I tend to seek validation in my anxieties from other people. And even when other people are like, I don't know, I don't know if this is like
[00:15:19.700] 是啊。哦，兄弟，我知道。我觉得这次健康危机让我意识到自己的一点，而且我觉得这不仅仅适用于健康焦虑，就像我生活中经历的很多事情一样，我倾向于从别人那里寻求焦虑的认同。即使别人说，我不知道，我不知道这算不算……
[00:15:44.000] a big deal, whether that's me sending them a picture of something on my face or like me talking about something else that I'm experiencing in my life. If they don't validate my fear, I think I still go to like get it. I see. And that's like one of the worst things that could happen because you basically have a theory or like a hypothesis and you're just looking for confirmation instead of actually like sitting
[00:15:44.000] 这对我来说意义重大，无论是我给他们发一张我脸上的照片，还是跟他们说说我生活中其他的经历。如果他们不认同我的恐惧，我想我还是会去找他们。我明白了。而这可能是最糟糕的情况之一，因为你基本上已经有了一个理论或假设，却只是在寻求证实，而不是真正地坐下来认真思考。
[00:16:10.540] down and like taking a step back and listening to what valuable opinion the other person has to say. It's not always the case that the person you're talking to has all the answers, but it's just like, you know when people say, oh, it's not that big of a deal. Like I could never do that. You're like, it's not a big deal. Well, I will find someone who realizes it is a big deal. Let me post this on Reddit right now. Dude, I guess isn't that kind of how mass hysteria starts?
[00:16:10.540] 放低姿态，退后一步，认真倾听对方的宝贵意见。你跟对方交谈时，对方未必能给出所有答案，但你知道，有些人会说，“哦，这没什么大不了的。”好像我永远不会那样做似的。你会想，这真的没什么大不了的。好吧，我会找到一个意识到这很重要的人。让我现在就把这事发到Reddit上。老兄，我猜这不就是群体歇斯底里开始的缘由吗？
[00:16:41.120] Dude, honestly, probably. Someone at first is like, oh, I feel like this isn't a big deal. And then the longer you talk about it, they're like, wait, you're convincing me now. I'm like, yeah, I am. And tell your friends too. You're like, this is why I took persuasive writing in high school. I'm in the wrong career. I need to start a cult immediately. Yeah, I feel like this behavior is very common though, because I can totally see moments where I
[00:16:41.120] 老兄，说真的，很有可能。一开始有人会觉得，哦，这没什么大不了的。但你越说越觉得，等等，你好像说服我了。我就说，是啊，我说服你了。然后你再跟你的朋友们说说。你会想，这就是我高中选修说服性写作课的原因。我真是选错行了。我得赶紧去搞个邪教。是啊，我觉得这种行为很常见，因为我完全能想象到那种场景……
[00:17:10.700] would react very similarly. And yeah, like it doesn't feel like a abnormal action or behavior to have. But do you have any on the opposite spectrum where it's things that feel bad but are good? So I think one thing that really helps me is exercise, which is very unfortunate because it takes a lot in me to go out and, you know, do stuff.
[00:17:10.700] 反应应该很相似。是啊，感觉这不算什么不正常的行为。但你有没有过相反的情况，就是感觉不好但实际上有益的事情？我觉得对我帮助很大的一件事就是运动，但这很可惜，因为我需要很大的勇气才能出门做点什么。
[00:17:35.780] But yeah, anytime that I'm like out in nature, or even just going to the gym and like lifting weights or something, it just makes me feel so much better. It's probably all of the hormonal or like, I don't know what happens in your body, like the endorphins that come up and tiring yourself out a little bit helps the racing thoughts slow down. Because now there's other things that I can focus on. And I think even something as simple as like feeling sore after leg day, it's just one more thing to
[00:17:35.780] 是啊，每次我到户外亲近自然，或者去健身房举举重什么的，都会感觉好很多。可能是激素分泌之类的吧，我也不知道具体是什么，反正就是内啡肽分泌多了，稍微累一点也能让思绪平静下来。因为这样我就能专注于其他事情了。我觉得哪怕是练腿后肌肉酸痛这种小事，也只是多了一件可以让我放松的事情而已。
[00:18:04.220] think about. That's a positive thing that happened in my life that I don't have to spiral about. So exercise is always good. Another thing is, this might be a little gross, but when I'm like really down in the dumps, I might skip a shower or two. And it's never like, super egregious, I will say, but it's just feels like a much more monumental task than it is when I'm not down in the dumps.
[00:18:04.220] 想想看。这是我生活中发生的一件好事，我不用为此耿耿于怀。所以锻炼总是好的。还有一点，这可能有点恶心，但当我情绪特别低落的时候，我可能会漏洗一两次澡。我得说，这从来都不是特别严重，但感觉上比我情绪正常的时候要难得多。
[00:18:32.220] And every time I skip a shower, I'm like, you know, I'll just do it tomorrow. It's not that bad. I'll just wait like another six hours or something. It always makes me feel like shit. And when I do force myself to shower, it feels so much better. Like I just feel more refreshed. I feel cleaner. So I think something as simple as that can really affect my mood too. Dude, actually, I feel like I've experienced something similar where I feel like when I'm sick
[00:18:32.220] 每次我偷懒不洗澡，我都会想，算了，明天再洗吧，没那么糟，再等个六小时什么的就行了。但每次都让我感觉糟透了。可当我强迫自己去洗澡的时候，感觉就好多了，整个人都神清气爽，干净清爽。所以我觉得像这样的小事也能影响我的心情。哥们儿，说真的，我感觉自己生病的时候也有过类似的经历。
[00:19:01.080] or not feeling great, taking care of yourself feels like such a monumental task. So, you know, showering or even like brushing your teeth, it just feels like such a hill to like climb. But then like, I have noticed in the past where I'm like kind of sick or feeling under the weather, I put off showering. And when I finally shower, I'm like, wait, I literally feel healthy again. Yeah. It's like the air feels crisper again.
[00:19:01.080] 或者感觉身体不舒服的时候，照顾自己感觉就像一项艰巨的任务。你知道，洗澡甚至刷牙都像是在攀登一座大山。但我发现，以前我生病或者感觉身体不舒服的时候，我会拖延洗澡。等我终于洗完澡，我就会想，等等，我感觉自己又恢复健康了。是的，就像空气又清新起来了一样。
[00:19:30.380] I'm like, why didn't I just shower? Dude. And it's just like, I think cleanliness or like hygiene in general, whether that's showering or even just the state of your room, that always affects me like very directly and immediately. But if I'm not having such a good day, or if I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed, I'm probably not going to clean my room. It's hard to keep that balance of like,
[00:19:30.380] 我就会想，我为什么不去洗个澡呢？老兄。我觉得清洁卫生，不管是洗澡还是房间的整洁程度，都会直接、迅速地影响到我。但如果我当天心情不好，或者感觉压力很大、不堪重负，那我可能就不会打扫房间了。要保持这种平衡真的很难，
[00:19:56.800] I still want to carve out time for myself so that I could be myself and feel my emotions and relax. But also if I don't do these day to day things, I'm going to feel like shit. Yeah, I'm actually reminded of a thought I had pretty recently. I was just like lying on my couch and I was like, I'm such a bum right now. Just, you know, tired from all the fun activities in life that we've been having. But I was like, I probably vacuum every like three to four days on
[00:19:56.800] 我仍然想抽出时间给自己，这样我才能做回自己，感受自己的情绪，放松身心。但如果我不做这些日常琐事，我会感觉糟透了。是啊，我最近突然想到一件事。当时我正躺在沙发上，心想，我现在真是个懒虫。你知道，就是因为最近参加的各种有趣的活动而感到疲惫。但我转念一想，我大概每三四天就要吸一次地。
[00:20:26.560] average. But I was like, I feel like I haven't vacuumed in like two weeks. And that feels a little it's like breaking your routine. And it could, you know, be a pretty small thing, but you just don't realize it until it's much later. And I was like, oh, but I should vacuum and I know I'll feel better after I do it. But like the idea of just getting up right now is too much.
[00:20:26.560] 还好。但我当时就想，我感觉自己好像两周没吸尘了。这感觉就像打乱了我的生活规律。你知道，这可能只是件小事，但你往往要过很久才会意识到。然后我就想，哦，我应该吸尘，我知道吸完之后我会感觉好些。但光是想到现在要起床就觉得太难了。
[00:20:51.900] I wonder if it feels really bad because it's like you're breaking a promise with yourself. You're like letting yourself down, even though there's no repercussions to other people. I mean, that makes a lot of sense to me. Do you think you have any like random tricks that you learned that help you kind of break out of your funk and back into your routine? Hmm. I don't know if it's necessarily a trick.
[00:20:51.900] 我觉得这种感觉很糟糕，就像违背了对自己的承诺。你好像在让自己失望，即使不会对其他人造成任何影响。我的意思是，这很有道理。你有没有什么独门秘诀，能帮你摆脱低落情绪，重新回到正常状态？嗯……我不知道这算不算秘诀。
[00:21:18.840] Wait, this. Okay, there's there's two. One's like really bad and one's like, you know, pretty reasonable. Okay. So the really bad one would just be like, just go all in, like go as bad as you can go. And then you basically have to like, look yourself in the mirror and be like, what am I doing? You need to get yourself together. So that's, you know, the really bad one. But I think
[00:21:18.840] 等等，这个。好吧，这里有两个。一个是特别糟糕的，另一个嘛，你知道，还算合理。好的。特别糟糕的那个就是，放开手脚，越糟糕越好。然后你基本上得对着镜子问问自己：我到底在干什么？你得振作起来。所以，你知道，这就是特别糟糕的那个。但我认为
[00:21:46.590] another one that sometimes helps me is I just like get this urge to like play loud music, like sad, whatever emotional music and I just lie on the ground. Wait, that's hella funny. Like if I do it in the bedroom, then I can lie on the bed. But if I'm in like the living room or something, I'll just lie on the ground.
[00:21:46.590] 还有一种方法有时对我有帮助，就是我会突然很想放一些很吵的音乐，比如悲伤的、任何能触动情绪的音乐，然后我就躺在地上。等等，这真的太搞笑了。如果我在卧室里，那我可以躺在床上。但如果我在客厅之类的地方，我就只能躺在地上了。
[00:22:13.990] What kind of loud music? Normal music that you're playing loud? Or is it like punk rock screamo type shit? Okay, not screamo, but like sad, like singer songwriter ballad or like, it could be anything really, but it's usually like chill and emotional. I like that. Yeah. I wonder if that's like a form of you externalizing your emotions without you having to verbally say it or like,
[00:22:13.990] 什么类型的大声音乐？是那种你平时放的大声音乐吗？还是像朋克摇滚那种嘶吼摇滚？好吧，不是嘶吼摇滚，而是那种悲伤的，像创作歌手的抒情歌之类的，其实什么都行，但通常是那种舒缓又充满情感的。我喜欢那种。嗯。我在想，这算不算你不用开口就能表达情感的一种方式？
[00:22:39.150] do something specific. You can put on a song that matches what you're feeling and you're like, this is it. Dude, maybe the song is talking for you. Right? Yeah. What about you? So I have two as well. One is kind of random. If I'm really feeling like shit, and there's multiple days where it's hard for me to get myself to do anything. I don't want to respond to people's text messages.
[00:22:39.150] 做点具体的事情。你可以放一首符合你心情的歌，然后你会想，就是它了。哥们，说不定这首歌就是在替你说话呢。对吧？没错。那你呢？我也有两个方法。一个比较随意。如果我心情特别糟糕，连续好几天都提不起劲儿做任何事，我就不想回别人的短信。
[00:23:04.270] Like I don't want to go out. One of the things that will really break that is if I put makeup on. Oh, okay. Okay. And I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it's because putting makeup on is so ingrained into my daily routine when I go out and do something. Even if I'm at home, like it brings me some sense of peace and familiarity and joy because I do like putting my makeup on and I do like seeing
[00:23:04.270] 就像我不想出门一样。如果我化妆，这种感觉就会彻底消失。哦，好吧。好吧。我也不知道具体原因。也许是因为化妆已经深深融入了我出门时的日常习惯。即使在家，化妆也能给我带来平静、熟悉和快乐，因为我喜欢化妆，也喜欢看到自己的样子。
[00:23:30.450] myself in the mirror all dolled up and stuff. So sometimes I'll do a full beat at 9pm. I'll just feel a little bit better. Wait, I can totally see how that helps because you're almost like tricking your brain into thinking you're about to go do something. Right. It's like the Pavlov response. Yeah. It's like, wait, why am I ready for the day now? Yeah. I feel like that's good. I can totally
[00:23:30.450] 我对着镜子精心打扮一番。所以有时候我会在晚上九点画个完整的妆。这样我会感觉好一些。等等，我完全明白这有什么帮助，因为你几乎是在欺骗你的大脑，让它以为你马上要去做某件事。对。就像巴甫洛夫的条件反射。是啊。就像，等等，为什么我现在准备好迎接新的一天了？嗯。我觉得这样很好。我完全可以
[00:23:56.250] see what you mean about putting makeup on can be very like soothing, like maybe almost a meditative activity. Yeah, that's true. Going through the motions of something that I know so well. And maybe it's also seeing that transformation and doing something with my hands, all of it together. It's like a very tactile experience. So it does feel kind of meditative sometimes. Dude, when this was bad
[00:23:56.250] 我明白你说的化妆确实很舒缓，几乎像是一种冥想。没错，确实如此。重复着我非常熟悉的动作。或许也因为看到妆容的变化，以及亲手操作的过程，所有这些加在一起，就让人感觉很放松。这是一种非常触觉化的体验。所以有时候确实感觉像是一种冥想。老兄，以前这很糟糕的时候
[00:24:21.590] in college, I used to do my makeup at night for no reason once a week, at least. Oh my god. We should have gone out. True. It's all wasted. You should have texted us like, hey guys, I got my face on. Let's go. I think my other easy trick that I like to do is probably more relatable for people. But sometimes I feel like my problems or my issues are very localized. So like I might feel
[00:24:21.590] 大学的时候，我至少每周都会毫无理由地在晚上化妆一次。天哪。我们应该出去玩的。真的。全浪费了。你应该给我们发个短信，比如，“嘿，伙计们，我化好妆了，走吧。” 我觉得我喜欢用的另一个简单小技巧可能更容易引起大家的共鸣。但有时候我觉得我的问题或烦恼都局限于特定的地方。所以就像我可能会觉得
[00:24:48.090] really busy because I'm hanging out a lot with the people that live close to me or like I might have a big vacation coming up that's stressing me out. Or, you know, there's just people that I wouldn't want to complain about my catastrophe too, because I don't want to offend them or make them feel like they're stressing me out or whatever. So what really helps me is when I hang out with someone who say isn't in like my daily circle, someone who's like more removed from my plans or more removed from what's
[00:24:48.090] 真的很忙，因为我经常和住在附近的人聚会，或者我可能马上要去度假了，这让我压力很大。或者，你知道，有些人我不想跟他们抱怨我的糟心事，因为我不想冒犯他们，或者让他们觉得他们在给我添麻烦什么的。所以，真正能帮到我的是和那些不在我日常圈子里的人待在一起，和那些不太了解我生活的人，那些和我的生活计划不太相关、不太了解我的人。
[00:25:15.610] going on in my life, talking to them about it. It just really calms me down because they can empathize, but it's not like a whole thing. You know, it's just like something that's happening in my life and then we move on. I think a good example of this is talking to your parents. At least when I call my parents since they don't live in state, I feel like I have a pen pal or something. Oftentimes it can just be someone who's not in like my direct friend group and I just feel so much
[00:25:15.610] 跟他们聊聊我生活中发生的事情，真的能让我平静下来，因为他们能感同身受，但又不会把事情闹得那么大。你知道，就像是我生活中发生的一件事，然后我们就继续往前走。我觉得跟父母聊天就是一个很好的例子。至少当我给不住在我这个州的父母打电话时，我感觉就像有个笔友一样。很多时候，打电话的人可能并不在我直接的朋友圈里，但我却能感受到很多。
[00:25:42.310] better after. I think that makes a lot of sense. Can totally relate with having a lot of upcoming events, but it's like, oh, well, if the people I normally complain to and whine with are the ones hosting these, how dare I? And sometimes it's also like a postmortem in a sense where my health scare, for example, or like, you know, whatever thing that happened in my life,
[00:25:42.310] 之后会好很多。我觉得这很有道理。我完全能理解即将有很多活动的感觉，但感觉就像，哦，好吧，如果平时跟我抱怨的人是这些活动的主办方，那我怎么敢抱怨呢？有时候，这也有点像事后分析，比如我的健康危机，或者你知道的，我生活中发生的任何事情，
[00:26:09.670] when I talk to someone and catch up with them for the first time in a couple months, I can look back and talk about a time that was very painful to me in a funny way or in a way that's not as serious. So even if that moment has passed and I'm like, okay, now that debrief with someone who's more removed makes me feel so much better because I'm like, okay, this chapter is closed and we can laugh about it. Even though at one point I was like fucking freaking out.
[00:26:09.670] 当我几个月没见的老朋友，第一次和他们聊天叙旧时，我可以回忆起过去那些让我非常痛苦的经历，然后用一种轻松幽默的方式，或者不那么严肃的方式去谈论。所以，即使那段痛苦的时光已经过去，即使我现在感觉好多了，和一位更了解情况的人聊聊这件事，也会让我感觉好很多，因为我觉得，好吧，这一篇章已经翻篇了，我们可以笑着谈起它了。尽管当时我真的吓坏了。
[00:26:34.930] Wait, that's so true. Like when we look back at these catastrophes and crises, you're like, wow, why was I so worked up at the moment? Like it's all good now. Dude. Yeah. Sometimes there could be an issue that is somewhat serious. For example, senior year of college, I had this moment for some reason where I miscounted my credits and I thought I had too few credits and I started freaking out because I was like, I don't think I can graduate on time.
[00:26:34.930] 等等，你说得太对了。就像我们回过头来看那些灾难和危机，你会想，哇，我当时怎么那么紧张？现在一切都好了。哥们儿，是啊。有时候确实会遇到一些比较严重的问题。比如，大学最后一年，我不知怎么算错了学分，以为学分不够，就开始慌了，心想我可能没法按时毕业了。
[00:27:03.410] Which if you think about it, not the biggest deal in the world. It's a little bit more money and you might start your job a little bit later, but you can recover from it. You know, it's not like a permanent loss. However, in that moment, I fucking had the worst anxiety attack ever. It was like a physical anxiety attack for me. Looking back at it now, I'm like, okay, I get that it was
[00:27:03.410] 仔细想想，这也不是什么天大的事。只是多赚了点钱，可能晚点开始工作，但你可以弥补的。你知道，这又不是什么永久性的损失。然而，当时我却经历了有史以来最严重的焦虑症发作。对我来说，那简直就像是生理上的焦虑症发作。现在回想起来，我心想，好吧，我明白了。
[00:27:28.190] like a serious thing, but why did I do all of that? Wait, the funniest part is you actually graduated early. Literally. I was like, what the fuck? That counting go crazy, dude. Yeah. You're like, wait, actually I finished a quarter early by everyone. I'm like, wait guys, I miscounted again.
[00:27:28.190] 就像一件很严肃的事，但我为什么要做这一切？等等，最搞笑的是你居然提前毕业了。真的。我当时就想，卧槽？那计数简直疯了，老兄。是啊。你会想，等等，实际上我比所有人都提前一个季度毕业了。我又想，等等，伙计们，我又数错了。
[00:27:51.450] Yeah. And I guess like these moments of looking back just really makes me laugh at those memes where it's like my body really can't tell the difference between an assignment due tomorrow and like a wolf chasing me through the woods. Yes. So true. And I'm like, damn, you fucking right. Same. I also like the ones that are like me when I have too much coffee, it always gives me an anxiety
[00:27:51.450] 是啊。我觉得这些回顾往事的时刻真的让我忍不住笑出声来，那些梗图里，我的身体好像分不清明天要交的作业和被狼在树林里追着跑到底是什么感觉。没错，太真实了。我就想，卧槽，你说的太对了。我也是。我还喜欢那些形容我喝太多咖啡时状态的梗图，喝太多咖啡总是让我焦虑不安。
[00:28:19.290] attack. And then me the next day, like has more coffee. We never learn. Okay. But I do have another question for you. I have this theory that you can't always be in a crisis barring very serious traumatic life events in your day-to-day life. I feel like you can't always be in crisis mode. Everyone has their own refractory period in between like catastrophes. So for some people,
[00:28:19.290] 攻击。然后第二天，我又喝了点咖啡。我们永远学不会。好吧。但我还有个问题想问你。我有个理论，除非日常生活中发生非常严重的创伤性事件，否则你不可能一直处于危机状态。我觉得你不可能一直处于危机模式。每个人在经历灾难之间都有自己的恢复期。所以对某些人来说，
[00:28:46.950] it might just be like a day, but at least you have that like day of break, right? For other people, it might be a couple of weeks. So what do you think yours is? Like how often are you having these crises? Dude. I mean, lately I can't lie. It's kind of a lot. What if my refractory period is just a day? But it's daily. It's hourly. It's actually hourly. Oh my God.
[00:28:46.950] 可能就一天，但至少你还有一天休息时间，对吧？对有些人来说，可能要持续好几周。所以你觉得你的恢复期是多久？你多久会经历一次这种危机？老兄，说实话，最近真的挺频繁的。如果我的恢复期只有一天呢？但它是每天都有，每小时都有，真的每小时都有。我的天哪。
[00:29:13.350] Well, I would say probably the latest one, it's weekly because as I mentioned, I just feel like I haven't had enough alone time slash recovery time from social obligations. So I feel like during the weekdays where I'm just more focused on, you know, going to work and getting whatever needs to be done, done. The crisis is in like 20% active, you know? I come home and I'm like, ah, yeah,
[00:29:13.350] 嗯，我觉得最近一次应该是每周一次，因为就像我之前说的，我觉得自己没有足够的独处时间，也没有足够的时间从社交活动中恢复过来。所以我觉得在工作日，我更专注于上班，完成所有需要做的事情。你知道，疫情大概只活跃了20%吧？我回到家，就会想，啊，是啊，
[00:29:42.970] I'm tired. I'm going to take it easy. But it's not true rest because I know I have tomorrow lurking in the, in the shadows. And then come the weekend, it, then it's like crisis. Cause it's like, I'm going to have fun with friends, but like I'm tired. So maybe like right now it's weekly. Okay. Weekly is fair enough. I think that's like a pretty decent refractory period. And I think
[00:29:42.970] 我累了。我打算好好休息一下。但这不算真正的休息，因为我知道明天还潜伏在阴影里。然后到了周末，就好像危机爆发了。因为我知道，我要和朋友们玩，但我又累得不行。所以也许现在每周休息一次比较合适。好吧，每周一次挺好的。我觉得这算是一个相当不错的休息周期。而且我觉得
[00:30:12.330] you're right. When times are super crazy, it is basically like every day and maybe your crisis itself is actually like three months long or something. Yeah. For me, if I'm talking about specific incidents, I think a week to two weeks seems about normal. If I had a crisis last weekend, for example, these weekdays, I'm going to feel so good, you know, cause I'm over the crisis.
[00:30:12.330] 你说得对。情况特别糟糕的时候，基本上每天都像在经历危机，你的危机本身可能持续了三个月甚至更久。是啊。对我来说，如果指的是具体事件，我觉得一到两周的时间比较正常。比如，如果我上周末遇到了危机，那么这几个工作日，我就会感觉特别好，因为我已经走出了危机。
[00:30:38.090] Oh yeah. I'm in like recovery mode. I'm on the come up from rock bottom, you know? So then I think it takes me about another week or so to feel ready to crash out again. Ooh. Okay. Actually, you're right. When I'm thinking about like really pointed or intense catastrophes. Yeah. There is that, like the high after where you're like, Oh my God, we survived.
[00:30:38.090] 哦，是啊。我现在处于恢复期。我正从谷底爬出来，你知道吗？所以我觉得大概还需要一周左右的时间才能再次崩溃。哦。好吧。其实，你说得对。当我想到那些特别严重或剧烈的灾难时。是啊。确实会有那种感觉，就像灾难过后那种兴奋劲儿，你会想，我的天哪，我们活下来了。
[00:31:06.510] Life is so good right now. I remember one of my piercings wasn't healing very well and it was causing me a lot of trouble and anxiety. And I would just like continuously freak out about it until finally I just committed. Okay. It was a crazy cycle because I would go to my piercer almost once a month to like check on it. I was like, how am I doing? Is the healing looking better?
[00:31:06.510] 现在的生活真美好。我记得之前我的一个耳洞愈合得不太好，让我很烦恼也很焦虑。我一直为此焦虑不已，直到最后我下定决心才去打耳洞。好吧。那真是个恶性循环，因为我几乎每个月都要去一次穿孔师那里检查。我总是问自己：我的情况怎么样了？愈合情况好转了吗？
[00:31:33.850] They're like, yeah, just keep at it. It looks a lot better. You know, we believe that this can heal and then it would feel a little better. And I'm like, okay, yeah, we can hang in there. But then like a week later I'd be like, no, I can't do this anymore. And then I finally one day just committed to getting rid of that piercing. And dude, I felt so good after that for like probably a month.
[00:31:33.850] 他们说，是啊，坚持下去。看起来好多了。你知道，我们相信它会愈合，然后感觉会好一些。我就说，好吧，我们可以坚持下去。但大概过了一个星期，我就会说，不行，我再也坚持不下去了。然后有一天，我终于下定决心把那个耳洞取下来。天哪，之后我感觉好极了，大概持续了一个月。
[00:32:00.170] I was riding that high for so long. Oh, hell yeah. Dude, no, it's actually a thing. I think you actually feel so good after you sort of pull yourself out of that catastrophe. And I feel like sometimes if that, I guess, triumph is recent enough, you can think back on it and it gives you another little boost. You're like, dude, I'm untouchable right now. No. You're like, I can't believe this was this problem that I resolved.
[00:32:00.170] 我当时那种感觉持续了很久。哦，当然了。兄弟，不，这真的有道理。我觉得当你从那场灾难中走出来之后，你会感觉特别好。而且我觉得，有时候，如果那场胜利发生得足够近，你回想起来，它会给你带来额外的动力。你会想，兄弟，我现在所向披靡。不，你会想，我简直不敢相信我竟然解决了这个问题。
[00:32:28.810] Yeah. You're like, I'm a fucking genius. I got through it. Like we're good now. Yeah. I can handle any problem that comes at me. Dude, what a whirlwind. It's literally 180 degrees because I know at least for me, my emotions during a catastrophe is nowhere near as positive. The negative self-talk can be so bad and I can just constantly be thinking about like the worst things. And what I noticed is with my
[00:32:28.810] 是啊。你会想，我真是个天才。我挺过来了。感觉一切都好了。是啊。我能应付任何难题。老兄，真是天翻地覆。这简直是180度大转变，因为我知道至少对我来说，灾难发生时的情绪远没有现在这么积极。消极的自我对话会非常糟糕，我会不停地想着最糟糕的事情。而且我注意到，我的
[00:32:57.570] catastrophe, right? If it's like a really bad event, there's usually a big panic moment in the beginning. And then towards like the middle is where I start to do like all my worst case scenario planning. And I know I'm over the hump when I can start laughing about it. When someone can say a joke and I can like crack a laugh, but up until that point, it's bad, you know?
[00:32:57.570] 是灾难吧？如果是特别糟糕的事情，一开始通常会很恐慌。然后到了中间阶段，我就会开始设想各种最糟糕的情况。我知道，当我能笑着谈论这件事的时候，就到头了。当有人讲个笑话，我能忍不住笑出来的时候，我就知道情况好转了。但在此之前，一切都很糟糕，你知道吗？
[00:33:19.590] Ooh, that's a good checkpoint. You're not just ha ha, but actually crying. You're like, oh, ha ha ha. Okay. But I have a question about the phase before the laughter. Does it ever get so bad? You feel like it is like literally holding you back from life? Hmm. I think I've definitely felt times where I was going through the motions at work and I was like,
[00:33:19.590] 哦，这算是一个不错的检查点。你不仅仅是哈哈大笑，而是真的在哭。你会想，哦，哈哈哈哈。好吧。但我有个关于大笑之前的阶段的问题。这种情况会变得很糟糕吗？你会觉得它真的阻碍了你的生活吗？嗯。我想我肯定有过这样的经历，在工作中只是机械地重复着一些事情，然后我就想，
[00:33:49.210] I can't believe I'm expected to work at this nine to five when this thing is going on in my life. And of course, like the more serious things that are like linked to actual big life events tend to do that more. My health anxiety isn't going to stop me from like working, for example. But if I had like a true health problem that wasn't like a scare, I could totally see that becoming debilitating for me. So I think it just depends. Luckily, I haven't had anything so serious
[00:33:49.210] 我简直不敢相信，在这种时候，我居然还要朝九晚五地工作。当然，那些更严重的、与人生重大事件相关的问题，往往会造成更大的影响。比如，我的健康焦虑不会让我停止工作。但如果我真的遇到了真正的健康问题，而不是那种虚惊一场，我完全可以想象它会让我无法正常工作。所以我觉得这要视情况而定。幸运的是，我还没有遇到过这么严重的问题。
[00:34:16.630] where it makes me like unfunctional as a person like at work. But I will say my crises can definitely affect my social life a lot quicker than it affects work. If I'm really going through it, I will start to pull out of like social plans and stuff. Okay, but actually another question. Does work ever become a distraction? Oh. Yeah. Like, you know, it's kind of cliche and like shows and stuff sometimes where it's like,
[00:34:16.630] 它让我感觉自己像个无法正常生活的人，比如在工作中。但我必须说，我的危机对我的社交生活的影响肯定比对工作的影响要快得多。如果我真的陷入困境，我会开始取消社交活动之类的。好的，其实还有个问题。工作会分散你的注意力吗？哦，是的。你知道，这有点老套，就像有些电视剧之类的，有时候会这样，
[00:34:43.850] yeah, I just throw myself into work when I am avoiding my like love life troubles or something. But does that ever happen? Like work becomes an accessible distraction? I think I've experienced that, but no more than like a day, you know, like I'm not going to be like fucking grinding for like a month straight, but maybe on like a really tough day where I don't want to think about all this other stuff, I might like lean in a little bit more into work. How about you? I wish I did.
[00:34:43.850] 是啊，我逃避感情问题之类的的时候就会全身心投入工作。但这种情况真的会发生吗？工作真的会成为一种唾手可得的消遣？我觉得我有过这种经历，但也就一天左右吧，你知道，我不可能连续一个月拼命工作，但也许在特别难熬、不想去想其他事情的时候，我会更专注于工作。你呢？真希望我也能这样。
[00:35:13.510] Sometimes I'm like, wow, if I could use work as a distraction as well as some people I know are capable of, I could be super productive. And I wonder sometimes too, if it actually helps you get out of your funk a little faster because there are moments when you complete tasks at work that, you know, give you that little burst of serotonin or like sense of accomplishment. And I wonder
[00:35:13.510] 有时候我会想，哇，如果我也能像我认识的某些人那样，把工作当作一种消遣，那我的效率肯定会大大提高。而且我有时也会想，工作是不是真的能帮助你更快地摆脱低落的情绪，因为当你完成工作中的某些任务时，你会感受到那种血清素的激增，或者那种成就感。我常常会想……
[00:35:41.890] sometimes maybe if you get enough of that positive feeling, it helps you feel more ready to tackle the other parts of your life. Oh, actually, that is such a good point. Sometimes I think, I mean, it depends really on your team or your work culture and stuff. But I think oftentimes you have this like bond with your coworkers. These are people that you talk to multiple times a week. And even if things are going on in your life,
[00:35:41.890] 有时候，如果你能获得足够的积极情绪，或许就能让你更有精力去应对生活中的其他挑战。哦，确实，这一点说得太好了。有时候我觉得，这真的取决于你的团队、工作文化等等。但我认为，很多时候你会和同事建立起一种联系。这些人你每周都会和他们交流好几次。即使生活中发生了一些事情，
[00:36:07.830] they are still someone who kind of like anchors you to work. And sometimes I'll have like a shit day where I'm like going through it. And then my coworker will be like, oh my God, like, thanks so much for sending this. You're awesome. And I'll feel healed a little bit. You're like, you're welcome. I'm like, no, thank you. But I think you bring up a good point where sometimes work feels like just like an obligation
[00:36:07.830] 他们就像是把你牢牢拴在工作上的锚点上。有时候我会遇到很糟糕的一天，感觉特别压抑。这时我的同事会说：“我的天哪，太感谢你发这个了，你真棒！” 我就会感觉好一些。你会说：“不客气。” 我会说：“不，应该是我谢谢你。” 但我觉得你说的很有道理，有时候工作真的就像是一种义务。
[00:36:35.590] and like a duty, but oftentimes it does become a source of joy in some ways. I think it's really easy for me personally to forget about how good small wins can sometimes feel. And sometimes those small wins are pretty easily found out work, you know, sending that email, getting a small task done off the checklist, you know, taking one small step on in a project.
[00:36:35.590] 就像一种责任，但很多时候，它也能在某种程度上带来快乐。我觉得对我个人而言，很容易忘记小小的胜利有时能带来多么美好的感觉。而这些小小的胜利有时很容易在工作中找到，比如发送一封邮件，完成清单上的一个小任务，或者在项目中迈出一小步。
[00:37:01.330] You know, maybe I will try to look towards that in the future. Next time we have like a health scare, we're like, should we work? Like, what if I sent an email? I have like a foundation brush in one hand and my work laptop in another. But yeah, I feel like a lot of this is really about balance because I can also see how work
[00:37:01.330] 你知道，也许以后我会尝试往那个方向发展。下次我们再遇到健康问题的时候，我们就会想，要不要继续工作？比如，如果我发封邮件呢？我一手拿着粉底刷，一手拿着工作用的笔记本电脑。不过，我觉得很多时候这真的关乎平衡，因为我也能看出工作的重要性。
[00:37:27.510] can totally become an unhealthy distraction too. If you throw yourself into it too hard and everything else is being neglected. It's one of those things where sometimes I feel like balance is so hard because I just have no idea. There's not like a scale or anything and there's no percentages when it comes to life. So it's hard to tell when you're perfectly balancing something and not. But I think this is probably a scale that comes with like aging in a sense. I do feel like I'm a little bit more
[00:37:27.510] 它也可能完全变成一种不健康的消遣。如果你全身心投入，忽略了其他一切。有时候我觉得保持平衡很难，因为我根本不知道该怎么做。生活没有标准，也没有百分比。所以很难判断你是否完美地平衡了某件事。但我认为这或许是随着年龄增长而逐渐形成的。我的确感觉自己比以前更……
[00:37:57.210] stable than I was in my early 20s, for example. So it's nice to see and experience a little bit of that growth, even though there's much more to grow still. Yeah. I'm like, what do you mean I just have to figure out how much emotion and logic to use in my day to day? Literally. And you mentioned earlier, sometimes you just have to hit rock bottom and then like
[00:37:57.210] 比我二十出头的时候稳定多了。所以很高兴看到和体验到这种成长，尽管还有很多需要提升的地方。是啊。我心想，你说我只需要弄清楚在日常生活中应该如何平衡情感和理性？真的。你之前也提到过，有时候你必须跌到谷底，然后……
[00:38:22.390] have one of those mirror conversations with yourself. But do you think that comes easily for you? Like having a sort of mental conversation or maybe like a mental checklist with yourself to sit yourself down and be like, hey, this is not okay. We can't be doing this. I think kind of in the sense where I can recognize, you know, what's happening. But like the mind knows, but does the body obey?
[00:38:22.390] 试着和自己进行一次“镜子对话”。但你觉得这对你来说容易吗？就像和自己进行某种内心对话，或者像列个清单一样，让自己冷静下来，告诉自己：“嘿，这样不行。我们不能再这样下去了。” 我觉得，我能意识到发生了什么，但就像大脑知道，身体却不听使唤一样。
[00:38:54.130] True. So recently, I've had some moments where I'm just not feeling that great. And then I'm basically immobile for a weekend and like unable to get myself to grocery shop and do chores and whatnot. I think, you know, I live with my husband now and we like share this married life. My habits and like my episodes affect other people around me. You know, I think I'm someone who struggles a lot
[00:38:54.130] 没错。最近，我时不时会感觉不太舒服。然后整个周末基本上都动不了，连去超市买菜、做家务什么的都做不了。你知道，我现在和丈夫住在一起，我们共同生活。我的生活习惯和我的这些状况会影响到身边的人。你知道，我觉得自己是个经常遇到困难的人。
[00:39:21.870] with like negative self-talk where the entire weekend when I'm being a shitter, I'll be like, you're such a shitter and like you shouldn't be doing this. All you do is whatever. And I'm sure you can like fill in the rest, but it's just like a constant audio stream of that. When I apologize to James and I'm like, sorry, I know I've been like, so am I like, I know I haven't done this. He always says, that's okay, you should rest or like something very kind that breaks through my negative self-talk.
[00:39:21.870] 就像那种周末我状态很差的时候，会一直进行负面的自我对话，比如我会想：“你真是个混蛋，你不应该这样。你只会做些乱七八糟的事。” 我相信你也能想象出后面那些话，反正就像一个永不停歇的音频流。当我向詹姆斯道歉，说“对不起，我知道我做错了”的时候，他总是会说：“没关系，你应该休息一下。”或者说一些很暖心的话，这些话能打破我内心的负面对话。
[00:39:50.770] And I noticed like the moment he says that I feel motivated to like get up and do stuff again. But until he says that it's just me berating myself. So it doesn't motivate me. So I've been trying to like game that a little bit. And when I go through stuff, I'm like, okay, like you deserve this rest or like, you know, this is okay. Just try to break out of it in like an hour or something and like be a little bit more kind. Cause what is it? Like donkey stick carrot, something, something.
[00:39:50.770] 我注意到，只要他说了那句话，我就感觉有动力重新振作起来做事了。但在他说那句话之前，我只会责备自己。所以那句话并不能激励我。因此，我一直在尝试稍微改变一下这种心态。当我遇到困难时，我会告诉自己，好吧，你应该休息一下，或者，你知道，这都没关系。试着让自己在一小时左右的时间里摆脱这种状态，对自己好一点。因为这就像胡萝卜加大棒一样，总之就是……
[00:40:20.730] Yeah. I'm like a carrot based person. I know what you're saying. I get what you mean. Yeah. But yeah, I guess what I'm just trying to say is learning to allow myself to like feel these things or like, you know, even to have these emotional ups and downs is a big learning for me too. That's true. Cause it's like also ignoring your emotions is not going to help just as fully throwing yourself into the emotion is also not going to be the most productive thing.
[00:40:20.730] 是啊，我就像个胡萝卜一样。我知道你的意思，我明白你的意思。嗯。不过，我想说的是，学会允许自己感受这些情绪，或者说，允许自己经历这些情绪的起伏，对我来说也是一个很大的学习过程。没错。因为忽视自己的情绪并不会有帮助，完全沉浸于情绪之中也并非明智之举。
[00:40:49.530] Yeah. You can't just like yell at yourself all the time and expect change to happen. I think. Yeah. But do you think you have any new learnings and stuff that you've unlocked in your late twenties for getting yourself out of a catastrophe? Actually, I did do an exercise with my therapist regarding this stuff. My therapist actually told me for one week, she was like, just fully listen to your emotions. Don't use any logic and then report
[00:40:49.530] 是啊。你不能老是冲自己大吼大叫，然后指望改变发生。我觉得是这样。是啊。但是你觉得你在快三十岁的时候，有没有学到什么新东西，或者有什么新领悟，能帮助你摆脱困境？其实，我之前和我的心理咨询师一起做过一个关于这方面的练习。我的咨询师让我花一周时间，完全倾听自己的情绪。不要用任何逻辑去分析，然后再去报告。
[00:41:17.330] back to me and tell me how it went. And I was like, yeah, it was like not good. And then she was like, okay, the next time just go fully in on the logic and then tell me how that goes. And I was like, that was also not good. So then we started talking about the balance aspect and it's just constantly playing around with it and seeing what ends up feeling the best. And as things in your life
[00:41:17.330] 回来告诉我结果如何。我说，嗯，不太好。然后她说，好吧，下次就完全按照逻辑来，然后再告诉我结果如何。我说，那也不行。所以我们就开始讨论平衡的问题，就是不断地尝试，看看哪种方式感觉最好。就像生活中的其他事情一样。
[00:41:43.770] changes, maybe that balance also changes a bit. And I was like, okay, so I guess there's no shortcut here. We just gotta do the work. Dude. It's so like Goldilocks coded, but I mean, it's such a good point. It actually reminds me, I just got a new cookbook recently and you know how in the beginning they always have like little blurbs or like, oh, laws in my kitchen. And one of the things that they put in there was cooking time.
[00:41:43.770] 变化，或许这种平衡也会随之改变。我就想，好吧，看来没有捷径可走。我们只能脚踏实地了。老兄，这简直就像童话故事里的金发姑娘一样，但我的意思是，这确实是个好观点。这让我想起，我最近刚买了一本新食谱，你知道，每本书开头总会有一些小段子，或者像“厨房法则”之类的。其中一条就是烹饪时间。
[00:42:08.330] And this person said, I went to culinary school and instead of being like, oh, cook the fish for 12 to 16 minutes, like we often see in recipes, the instructions at culinary school are like, cook the fish until it's done. And she was like, you may find this to be very weird because we're very used to like hard coding stuff to numbers and whatnot. But oftentimes you just have to like, keep checking it. And that's the best way to know. I was just like, dude, I know in my head,
[00:42:08.330] 这个人说，我上过烹饪学校，不像我们经常在食谱里看到的那样，把鱼煮12到16分钟，烹饪学校的指导是，把鱼煮到熟透为止。她说，你可能会觉得这很奇怪，因为我们习惯了把烹饪时间用数字之类的东西硬编码。但很多时候，你只需要不断地检查，这才是最好的方法。我当时就想，老兄，我知道，
[00:42:34.290] this is like really profound and factual, but as like a reader, I was like, I need numbers. I need like an exact duration. Yeah. You're like, so today is it a 40% emotion and 60% logic or is that like 30% logic and 70% emotion? Let me know guys. I need like a daily weather forecast or something. Oh my God. That'd be so helpful.
[00:42:34.290] 这确实很深刻也很有道理，但作为读者，我当时就想，我需要数字。我需要一个确切的持续时间。是啊。你会想，所以今天的情况是40%的情感和60%的逻辑，还是30%的逻辑和70%的情感？告诉我吧，伙计们。我需要一份每日天气预报之类的东西。我的天哪。那会很有帮助的。
[00:43:01.030] Right. But I think jokes aside, the lesson that I'm taking away here is just, you just have to be in touch with yourself all the time. And more importantly, be okay with not knowing whether it's not knowing the future, not knowing what the exact balance is, just kind of vibing it out every day as hard as that is. So hopefully this was relatable for any of our listeners out there. If you're going through a catastrophe, me and Crystal probably are too at that same exact moment.
[00:43:01.030] 没错。不过玩笑归玩笑，我从中得到的教训是，你必须时刻与自己保持联系。更重要的是，要接受自己无法预知未来，无法准确把握平衡，只能每天顺其自然，即使这很难。希望我们的听众朋友们能感同身受。如果你正经历着一场灾难，我和克丽丝塔尔可能也正经历着同样的困境。
