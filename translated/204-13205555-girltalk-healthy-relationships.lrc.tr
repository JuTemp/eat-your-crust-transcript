[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jessica. So today we're back with a Girl Talk episode and you might hear a familiar voice, Jessica. She has been on episode 117, Startup Culture in the Workplace. And fun fact, she was also
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal，我是Jessica。今天我们又带来了一期“女生聊天”节目，你可能会听到一个熟悉的声音——Jessica。她曾参与过第117期节目，主题是“职场创业文化”。有趣的是，她也……
[00:00:30.380] our roommate in college. So the three of us, me, Jessica and Crystal, we used to live together back in the college days. But before we jump into our topic, Crystal, let's hear your Gen Z word of the week. So this week's Gen Z word is actually an acronym, which is kind of exciting because I think we talked about it a few times that Gen Z doesn't seem to use acronyms too much. So the word is POV,
[00:00:30.380] 我们大学时的室友。我们三个，我、杰西卡和克丽丝塔尔，大学时住在一起。不过在我们正式开始今天的话题之前，克丽丝塔尔，先说说你本周的Z世代词汇吧。本周的Z世代词汇其实是一个首字母缩写词，这还挺让人兴奋的，因为我们之前讨论过几次，Z世代似乎不太常用首字母缩写词。这个词是POV。
[00:00:54.740] which stands for point of view. It's used kind of interestingly. I guess the best way I can think to describe it is that it is used to describe like videos. Oh, like POV, this is what's happening in the video. Like you're on your way to walk your dog or something. And the video is like someone is about to walk their dog. Yeah, I think I first saw it on TikTok when acting out skits sort of solo,
[00:00:54.740] 它代表观点（point of view）。它的用法挺有意思的。我觉得最好的解释就是，它用来描述视频。比如，POV，视频里正在发生什么。就像你正要去遛狗之类的。视频里的人正准备遛狗。嗯，我记得第一次看到它是在TikTok上，当时有人在表演一些独角戏。
[00:01:20.460] almost monologue style skits of people acting out scenarios were really hype. So it would be like POV, you have a really strict teacher, and they're sending you to detention. And then like the TikToker would pretend to be a student getting in trouble, act out the scenario and stuff like that. And I was like, this is a crazy like that was when TikTok was peak creativity and less so like, look at this funny thing that happened to me sort of. So kind of like a culture shock for me. I was like, wow, they have all these scenarios in their head, and they're just acting it out.
[00:01:20.460] 那种几乎是独白式的情景剧真的太火了。比如，以第一人称视角，你遇到一个非常严厉的老师，被罚留校。然后TikTok用户就会假装自己是个犯错的学生，把这个情景演绎出来之类的。我当时就觉得，这太疯狂了，那时候TikTok的创意正处于巅峰，而不是像现在这样，到处都是“看我遇到的这个搞笑事”之类的。所以对我来说，这有点像文化冲击。我当时就想，哇，他们脑子里居然有这么多情景，而且还演得这么好。
[00:01:50.000] Yeah, I think those are the ones that I've seen too. Or sometimes I think recently, I've seen the ones where it's just someone filming themselves or like filming something completely random. And then it's just giant text over the video that's like POV, blah, blah, blah, and like a scenario that has nothing to do with the actual video. So we should go back to the creative
[00:01:50.000] 对，我觉得我也见过那种。或者最近，我有时会看到一些视频，就是有人自拍或者拍一些完全随机的东西。然后视频上会叠加一大段文字，比如“POV视角”之类的，跟视频内容完全无关。所以我们还是应该回到创意上来。
[00:02:11.420] days. It kind of reminds me of when millennials were big on Tumblr. Instead of like the POV meme format, it would be like when your boyfriend does blah, blah, blah, or like when something, something, something. And it's just like describing a scenario pretty much. Yeah, that's true. I actually thought of this word today because I'm currently visiting Dallas and I went to a museum is all about the JFK
[00:02:11.420] 日子啊。这让我想起千禧一代在 Tumblr 上风靡的那段时间。那时候不是那种 POV 式的表情包，而是像“当你的男朋友做了……等等等等”或者“当某某某发生的时候”。基本上就是描述一个场景。对，没错。我今天想到这个词，是因为我现在在达拉斯，去了一个专门介绍肯尼迪遇刺案的博物馆。
[00:02:39.560] assassination. In the museum, they kind of talk about a few conspiracies. And there's one that's like, there's like another spot where someone had fired a gun for the assassination. So we walked over to the spot of the conspiracy theory and it's by this fence. When we walked over to it, there's like some graffiti on the fence and someone wrote POV, you're the real JFK assassin. I was like, whoa.
[00:02:39.560] 刺杀事件。在博物馆里，他们谈到了一些阴谋论。其中一个说法是，在另一个地方有人开枪刺杀了肯尼迪。所以我们走到这个阴谋论的地点，就在这道栅栏旁边。我们走过去的时候，发现栅栏上有涂鸦，有人写着“POV，你才是真正的肯尼迪刺客”。我当时就震惊了。
[00:03:05.880] Dude, that's a really good use of it. Yeah, they're so funny. This generation is hilarious. I feel like millennials didn't get the funny bone as much as Ben Z did. Yeah, I think it's always pretty funny because it's like, it's kind of witty to use like POV describing the scenario. Sometimes it's like what wasn't explicitly shown in the video. And it's like the behind the scenes kind of of the video or the
[00:03:05.880] 老兄，这用得真妙。是啊，他们太逗了。这一代人太搞笑了。我觉得千禧一代没本·Z那么懂幽默。是啊，我觉得这总是挺搞笑的，因为用POV（主观视角）来描述场景挺机智的。有时候就像视频里没直接展现出来的东西，或者说是视频的幕后花絮。
[00:03:31.020] like implied thing. How easy is this term to use in real life? Do you guys think? It's probably not too hard to use it, but to use it well might be a little harder. Yeah, like you have to put a lot of thought into it for sure. I feel like it needs to be funny if you're going to use it because POV is very much like a setup for like a hilarious joke. And if the follow through isn't good, then it's just like, okay, you just use a Gen Z word, but
[00:03:31.020] 就像某种隐含的东西。这个词在现实生活中容易用吗？你们觉得呢？用起来可能不难，但要用好可能就有点难了。是啊，肯定要好好想想。我觉得用这个词就得有点幽默感，因为POV（视角）很像一个搞笑笑话的铺垫。如果后续效果不好，那就只是，好吧，你只是用了一个Z世代的词，但是……
[00:03:59.040] you know, your jokes aren't matching up to the name basically. I agree with what you said, Jisoo, about how POV is similar to the millennial when something, something, something. And that actually reminded me of a previous Gen Z word of the week, eras. Or like, I'm in my blah era. And then you guys kind of related it back to the millennial phase, right? The mom is not just a phase, but kind of used in a slightly different way.
[00:03:59.040] 你知道，你的笑话和名字不太搭调。我同意你说的，Jisoo，POV 和千禧一代在某些时候很像。这让我想起了之前 Z 世代的每周词汇“时代”。或者像“我正处于我的……”之类的。然后你们又把它和千禧一代的阶段联系起来了，对吧？“妈妈”不仅仅是一个阶段，它的用法也略有不同。
[00:04:28.640] It's interesting to see all these Gen Z words kind of adopting a different actual word, but there are roots elsewhere in millennial language and probably before that too. Yeah, that's true. Like in the end, a lot of the same things are just being said in a different way. Yeah. It's so funny too, that you say that because for a while, and we have also talked about this on this podcast, I think, but for a while, Gen Z TikTokers were like flaming millennials for being
[00:04:28.640] 很有意思的是，看到Z世代的这些词汇似乎都在借用其他词语，但它们其实起源于千禧一代的语言，甚至可能更早。没错，确实如此。归根结底，很多相同的事情只是换了一种表达方式而已。是啊。你说得也很有趣，因为有一段时间，我们好像也在播客里聊过，Z世代的TikTok用户一直在抨击千禧一代……
[00:04:58.200] really cringe. And there were a lot of like, in hindsight, cringe things that were really popular with us when we were probably like 13, 14, even up to high school and whatnot. But I noticed that the new trend on TikTok is Gen Z people doing like self critique sort of. So they were like, oh, it's kind of cringe when like Gen Z people say Delulu or whatever, like the new phrase is. Oh my gosh. They're like, we're just basically like millennials. And I'm like, oh my god, they're maturing and like evolving, you know?
[00:04:58.200] 真是尴尬。现在回想起来，我们十三四岁，甚至高中那会儿，流行过很多现在看来都很尴尬的东西。但我注意到TikTok上新流行Z世代的自我批评。他们会说，哦，Z世代说“妄想症”之类的词，真是有点尴尬，就像最近流行的那种。天哪。他们会说，我们基本上就是千禧一代。我就想，我的天，他们也在成熟，也在进步，你知道吗？
[00:05:28.340] Oh my god. Oh my god. They're in their self-aware era. I can't wait for the next generation to come up. Yet somehow they still managed to shit on us. I know. They're like, oh my god, we're so cringe. We're just like millennials. It's like, fuck. They're cheeky now. Well, I guess Gen Z word aside, let's kind of jump into the topic this week.
[00:05:28.340] 我的天啊。我的天啊。他们现在正处于自我意识觉醒的时代。我迫不及待地想看看下一代。然而，他们居然还能嘲笑我们。我知道。他们会说，我的天啊，我们太尴尬了。我们简直跟千禧一代没什么两样。真是的。他们现在可真够厚脸皮的。好吧，先不说Z世代了，咱们这周就直接进入正题吧。
[00:05:52.820] Today, our Girl Talk topic is healthy relationships. I think in a lot of our past Girl Talks, we've talked about kind of like the beginning stage of relationships and how we approach those things. But you know, oftentimes, once you get through that beginning stage, there's a whole mid to long term stage of a relationship that you encounter. And I think there's a lot of interesting things and learnings that go on during that period as well.
[00:05:52.820] 今天，我们的“闺蜜聊天”主题是健康的恋爱关系。我觉得在之前的很多期“闺蜜聊天”中，我们都聊过恋爱初期以及我们如何处理这些问题。但你知道，很多时候，一旦度过了初期阶段，恋爱关系就会进入中期甚至长期阶段。我认为在这个阶段也会有很多有趣的事情和值得学习的地方。
[00:06:19.700] Let's start off with talking about some challenges. Crystal and Jessica, what have been some of the biggest challenges for you or your relationships kind of early on? I think I kind of have an answer here. I feel like in the beginning of relationships, it's really easy to like get very caught up in it. You end up spending a ton of time on it. So it's easy to like forget
[00:06:19.700] 我们先来聊聊挑战吧。Crystal 和 Jessica，你们或者你们的感情在初期遇到的最大挑战是什么？我想我大概能回答这个问题。我觉得在感情初期，很容易就会沉迷其中，花费大量时间。所以很容易忘记……
[00:06:45.780] about all your other responsibilities, I guess. And then that relationship becomes the center of your focus, I guess. So I think that's like maybe a very common one. Because I feel like it was also a common thing back in the day to be like, oh, this person's entering a new relationship. They never hang out with us now because they're just so focused on it. It's like super easy to get caught up in it. Yeah, that makes me think too. I wonder if part of the difficulty of that is like, almost like the integration because it's like when you're first starting out a relationship,
[00:06:45.780] 我想，你大概会把其他所有责任都抛在脑后吧。然后，这段感情就成了你生活的重心。所以我觉得这很常见。因为我觉得以前也经常发生这种情况：哦，这个人开始一段新的恋情了。他们现在都不跟我们一起玩了，因为他们全身心都投入到这段感情里了。很容易就会被卷进去。是啊，这也让我想到。我在想，这其中的难处是不是在于，就像是融合的过程，因为就像刚开始一段感情的时候，
[00:07:15.180] you're like constructing something from nothing to something. But then once you have that thing built out, you need to integrate it into your daily life because your whole life isn't just going to be this person. It's like you also have friends and like your job and your hobbies and things like that. But to go from construction to like integrating, I think that transition can definitely be a challenge. I think for me, it was interesting because I had never been in a relationship prior to my
[00:07:15.180] 你就像是从无到有地建造一些东西。但一旦你把这些东西建造好了，你就需要把它融入你的日常生活，因为你的生活不会只有这个人。你还有朋友、工作、爱好等等。但从建造到融入，我认为这个转变绝对是一个挑战。对我来说，这很有意思，因为在此之前我从未谈过恋爱。
[00:07:41.500] current relationship, which wonderfully worked out really great. But I remember at the very beginning, when we first started dating first, second, third month ish, I was very adamant to not be that person who was like, oh, like, she just got into a new relationship disappears off the face of the earth to all our friends. So I was very determined to like, be chill, and still be
[00:07:41.500] 我现在的这段感情发展得非常顺利。但我记得刚开始的时候，大概一两个月、三个月左右，我非常坚定地不想成为那种“哦，她一谈恋爱就跟人间蒸发”的人，不想让朋友们都知道她刚开始一段新的恋情。所以我下定决心要保持冷静，同时也要……
[00:08:09.560] exactly who I was, not spend all of my time with him, which was obviously very difficult. And I think because I had never been in a relationship before that, and like seeing all my friends who would sort of like disappear or, you know, bring their boyfriend along to everything. And I knew how that made me feel, which wasn't bad in any way. But it was just like, okay, it was something that because I had seen everyone else do that, I was more conscious of it in the beginning. That was a little bit of a
[00:08:09.560] 做真正的自己，而不是把所有时间都花在他身上，这显然非常困难。我想是因为我之前从未谈过恋爱，而且我看到我的朋友们要么会消失，要么会带着男朋友参加各种活动。我知道那种感觉，这倒没什么不好。但就是，因为我看到其他人都那样做，所以一开始我会更加在意。这有点像……
[00:08:39.400] transition in the beginning, and not necessarily like a huge challenge per se, but just something that I became more conscious of as time went on. I feel like that's pretty good. Because it's like, you truly learned from other people's experiences. Because I feel like nowadays, in our current age, that kind of pattern doesn't happen as often. But like, you know, way back in, say, high school or something, it was like a very common thing to see happen to friends.
[00:08:39.400] 一开始确实有点过渡期，倒不是什么巨大的挑战，只是随着时间的推移，我越来越意识到这一点。我觉得这挺好的。因为这就像是从别人的经历中真正学到了东西。我觉得现在，在我们这个时代，这种模式并不常见。但你知道，比如说，在高中那会儿，朋友之间发生这种事是很常见的。
[00:09:06.120] Yeah. Unfortunately, I'm like low-key that bitch that just falls into a relationship really hard. But for me, my biggest challenge was probably kind of like the transition phases that I was talking about. So everyone always talks about like the honeymoon phase, and I think it's very real. But as the term indicates that phase doesn't last the whole time, especially if it's like a really intense honeymoon
[00:09:06.120] 是啊。不幸的是，我就是那种很容易就陷进去一段感情的人。对我来说，最大的挑战可能就是我之前提到的过渡阶段。大家都说恋爱初期会有蜜月期，我觉得确实如此。但正如这个说法所示，蜜月期不会一直持续下去，尤其是一段非常热烈的蜜月期。
[00:09:32.980] phase where you're like really honeymooning, you know, you can't live like that forever. Or maybe some couples can, but I feel like in my experience, there's some sort of fade off there. I have this theory where a lot of couples kind of break up around the two-year mark or so. And I think sometimes it's because that's when the honeymoon phase really drops off. And you have a choice of like, this person is going to be in my lifestyle, okay meeting my family and friends all the time,
[00:09:32.980] 你知道，那种如蜜月般的甜蜜期，不可能永远持续下去。或许有些情侣可以，但就我的经验而言，感觉总会有褪色的时候。我有个理论，很多情侣会在两年左右分手。我觉得有时候是因为蜜月期真的结束了。你会面临这样的选择：这个人要融入我的生活方式，要经常见我的家人朋友，
[00:10:00.060] and I'm okay meeting his family and friends, etc, etc. Or you're like, well, maybe I just enjoyed the honeymoon or like the newness of this relationship. For me, I feel like it was going from, oh my god, this is absolute bliss. Like I am obsessed with this person. Being with this person brings me the utmost joy to like, okay, now I actually have to like live my life and like be like a normal person. You know, maintaining the love and the excitement even after that new phase is over was probably
[00:10:00.060] 我觉得见他的家人朋友什么的都没问题。或者你会想，也许我只是享受了蜜月期或者这段感情的新鲜感。对我来说，感觉就像是从“天哪，这简直太幸福了！”那种感觉，就像我完全迷恋上这个人，和这个人在一起让我无比快乐，变成了“好吧，现在我真的要好好生活，像个普通人一样生活”。你知道，即使过了那个新鲜阶段，要保持爱和激情，可能真的很难。
[00:10:28.960] a challenge for me. Because then that's when you like really start to talk about shit, I feel. That's when you learn how to combat challenges or like conflict together. So not just like fun and rainbow sort of. Yeah, I think transition overall is pretty difficult all the time. Yeah, I think something that was interesting for me, and it might be now that I'm thinking about it
[00:10:28.960] 对我来说是个挑战。因为我觉得，那时候你们才会真正开始谈论一些棘手的问题。那时候你们才会学会如何共同应对挑战或冲突。所以，不仅仅是轻松愉快、充满乐趣。是的，我认为转型期总体来说一直都很困难。是的，我觉得有一点很有意思，现在想想可能也是。
[00:10:51.620] might be specific to that time period. When we first got together, our first year was like our last year of college. So that kind of lines up with the honeymoon phase. And it was also, I think, compounded by the fact that it was like senior year of college. And it's like, you know, everyone's having a lot of fun. And it naturally is just a very fun time of your life. And then it kind of timed itself well with honeymoon phase ending. And then we're also graduating and entering into the workforce.
[00:10:51.620] 这可能与那段时间有关。我们刚在一起的时候，我们在一起的第一年正好是我们大学的最后一年。所以，这有点像蜜月期。而且，我觉得这也和大学最后一年的情况有关。你知道，那时候每个人都过得很开心。那自然是人生中最美好的时光之一。然后，蜜月期结束的时候，我们俩也正好毕业，开始工作了。
[00:11:22.020] And life gets a little bit more dreary, not as carefree as when you're in school. Right. And so something for me, I feel like during that time period of transition was not only having my relationship be transitioning in its phases, but also the rest of my life also kind of transitioning where I'm transitioning from being a student all my life to now working full time and kind of dealing
[00:11:22.020] 生活变得有些沉闷，不像学生时代那样无忧无虑了。没错。对我来说，我觉得那段过渡时期不仅包括我的感情经历各个阶段，也包括我生活的其他方面，比如我从学生时代过渡到全职工作，需要应对各种各样的事情。
[00:11:49.240] with that and bringing different aspects of what was changing in my life to my relationship, and then also vice versa. Right. I'm not sure how many people can relate to that very specific transition period. But that time period was a lot of learning what we needed to expect from each other. Obviously, you know, people always say like, you know, the most important thing is communication,
[00:11:49.240] 随之而来的是，我生活中发生的各种变化也影响着我们的关系，反之亦然。没错。我不确定有多少人能感同身受那段特殊的过渡期。但那段时间，我们花了很多时间去了解彼此需要期待什么。当然，人们总是说，沟通是最重要的，
[00:12:13.820] which is, of course it is. But also really understanding how to fight your fights. I think that makes a lot of sense. And just like if anyone in a relationship were to go through any sort of change, new job, or as you said, like from student to working, it's like extra stress just in general, right? Like as a person, you're like, fuck, I have this relationship. And now I have this like extra stress to think about. So can totally understand that.
[00:12:13.820] 当然是这样。但更重要的是要懂得如何应对挑战。我觉得这很有道理。就像任何恋爱关系中的人，如果经历任何变化，比如换工作，或者像你说的，从学生变成上班族，都会增加额外的压力，对吧？你会想，糟了，我得应付这段感情。现在又多了这些额外的压力要考虑。所以我完全能理解。
[00:12:43.600] I think that brings up a really good point too, of like, how do you deal with conflict in a romantic relationship? Because things always come up. Sometimes it is internal stuff like in your relationship that are active issues that you need to combat. And other times it's conflict that arises from an external source that you still need to fight as like a couple. So how do you kind of go about with bringing things up when it's a problem and also resolving it together? Well, I guess the classic
[00:12:43.600] 我觉得这也引出了一个非常好的问题，那就是，在恋爱关系中，如何处理冲突？因为总会遇到各种各样的问题。有时候是你们关系内部的问题，需要你们去解决。而有时候，冲突则来自外部，你们仍然需要作为伴侣共同面对。那么，当问题出现时，你们该如何提出问题，又该如何一起解决呢？嗯，我想，经典的沟通方式还是适用的。
[00:13:11.240] saying or whatever is that you try to tackle a problem as a team, that you're solving it together instead of trying to win. But that's always easier said than done. I think something that has helped me is, I'm not really sure where I learned this from. It was definitely pre TikTok era. It's basically instead of phrasing your arguments or like what you want to
[00:13:11.240] 意思是说，你们要尝试以团队的形式解决问题，共同解决问题，而不是只想着赢。但这说起来容易做起来难。我觉得对我有帮助的一点是，我不太确定是从哪里学到的，肯定是在TikTok时代之前。基本上就是，与其费力地表达你的观点或者你想表达什么，不如……
[00:13:38.440] say in a way that's very blamey, like you're blaming the other person or when you say like, oh, like you did this and you did this and then you did this. And it just feels like you're putting a lot of blame on the other person. But instead, it's kind of phrasing what you want to say in terms of, yes, they did this. But more importantly, how did that make you feel? So actually, maybe I learned
[00:13:38.440] 用一种充满指责意味的方式说话，就像你在责怪对方，或者说，哦，你做了这个，你做了那个，然后你又做了这个。这感觉就像你在把很多责任都推到对方身上。但实际上，你应该这样表达：是的，他们做了这件事。但更重要的是，这让你感觉如何？所以，也许我学到了
[00:14:01.880] this at work. But it's like, you know, when you didn't remember my birthday, it made me feel very undervalued or it made me feel like you didn't really care about me or something like that. And I think that way of framing it helps to still put the situation and the issue at hand, like in the spotlight. But that's also highlighting, like more importantly, the result of what happened in that
[00:14:01.880] 这事儿发生在工作上。你知道，当你忘记我的生日时，我会觉得自己很不受重视，或者觉得你根本不在乎我之类的。我觉得这样说有助于把事情和问题放在聚光灯下，让大家关注到重点。但更重要的是，这也突出了这件事的后果。
[00:14:31.380] situation, right? And it's like, yes, you're still highlighting what they did wrong or what you felt like they did wrong. But you're also kind of showing them that like, I get that you did this, but it's bad or I feel like it's bad and it's shitty because it made me feel some type of way. That's not a good way to feel in a relationship. So I feel like it makes for a more conducive conversation rather than like straight up argument where you might be pointing fingers at each other a lot.
[00:14:31.380] 情况就是这样，对吧？就像，没错，你仍然在强调他们做错了什么，或者你觉得他们做错了什么。但你同时也在告诉他们，我知道你做了这件事，但这很糟糕，或者我觉得这很糟糕，因为它让我感觉很不好。在一段关系中，这种感觉很不好。所以我觉得这样更有利于沟通，而不是直接争吵，互相指责。
[00:14:59.840] I think I actually heard about that as well. Also not from TikTok. But I always liked that advice as well. I'm pretty sure I actually learned it from work. Like at my first job when I was trying to learn to manage people. And I'm pretty sure my boss told me to use that like strategy. And I was like, oh, you're like, I'm gonna use that on one of my direct reports, my boyfriend.
[00:14:59.840] 我觉得我也听说过这个。而且不是从TikTok上看到的。但我一直都很喜欢这个建议。我几乎可以肯定我是在工作中学到的。就像我第一份工作的时候，我刚开始学习管理员工。我记得我的老板好像跟我说过要用这个策略。然后我就想，哦，你肯定在想，我要把这招用在我的一个下属身上，也就是我的男朋友身上。
[00:15:25.320] But yeah, I do like that. I think it definitely helps relieve some of the targeted language, I guess. It feels more like, oh, this, as you said, like a result. And then you're like, okay, well, what can we do to fix that? Also, I can relate to this because I feel like fights and conflict often are triggered by like a certain emotion, whether it's like you're really upset or sad or like you're angry. And I think
[00:15:25.320] 是的，我确实喜欢这样。我觉得这确实有助于减少一些针对性的语言表达。感觉更像是，哦，就像你说的，这是一个结果。然后你会想，好吧，那我们该怎么做来解决这个问题呢？而且，我能理解这一点，因为我觉得争吵和冲突通常是由某种情绪引发的，比如你非常沮丧、悲伤或者愤怒。我觉得
[00:15:49.180] personally, anger and sadness are probably my two like quickest trigger emotions sort of. When I first started dating James and also just like dating in general, I feel like there were a lot of things that would like annoy me or I would be mad at and then I would go into these fights feeling that emotion already. And this is gonna sound really stupid. And I don't think this is universal advice. So please take this with a grain of salt. But because any sort of fight that I would start where I was mad,
[00:15:49.180] 就我个人而言，愤怒和悲伤大概是我最容易被激怒的两种情绪。刚开始和詹姆斯约会的时候，或者说，在恋爱初期，我感觉有很多事情会让我生气或恼火，然后我就会在带着这种情绪的时候去争吵。我知道这听起来很傻，而且我觉得这也不是什么普遍适用的建议，所以请不要完全相信我的话。但是，因为任何我因为生气而引发的争吵，
[00:16:16.960] it would always end poorly, because it's like, I'm in there with like a certain aggressive mood or emotion or something. So then I realized that like fights that happen when I'm sad go better, you know, because it's like, they're not necessarily on the defensive. They're just like, oh my god, there's like a sad person, and I'm gonna feel a certain way. They're probably apologetic. And then I'm feeling also apologetic. So I'm like, oh my god, don't be sad, because I'm sad. So then I feel
[00:16:16.960] 每次都以糟糕的结局收场，因为我当时总是带着某种攻击性或情绪状态。后来我意识到，如果我心情不好，争吵反而会好一些，因为对方不一定处于防御状态。他们会想，天哪，有个伤心的人，我肯定会有感觉。他们可能会感到抱歉。然后我也会感到抱歉。所以我会想，天哪，别难过，因为我也很伤心。然后我就觉得……
[00:16:42.300] like it ended better. So I try to kind of guide my emotions in that way. I'm like, okay, I'm sad because what this person did made me feel sad instead of like, oh, I'm pissed that you did this, because why would you do this? Because I'm sad. You know what I mean? So I know it sounds really stupid. But that's just like something that kind of works for me. It's almost like you're calming down your anger. Yeah, definitely. Do you feel like part of a sadness is also like disappointment?
[00:16:42.300] 感觉结局还不错。所以我试着用这种方式引导自己的情绪。我会想，好吧，我难过是因为这个人做的事让我难过，而不是想，哦，我真生气你这么做，你为什么要这么做？因为我难过。你明白我的意思吗？我知道这听起来很傻。但这对我来说确实挺管用的。感觉就像是在平息怒气。嗯，确实如此。你觉得悲伤的一部分也包含失望吗？
[00:17:07.880] Yeah, I think sometimes it is that too. And I will say, I think one of the benefits of like a really long term relationship is you get to know each other so well. There are times where I'm about to do something and I'm like, this is gonna piss James off. And then I'm like, I shouldn't do that. Like, naughty, naughty, you know? And then I'm sure he has the same things too. Or sometimes he'll be like, oh, I almost did this. But I knew that would annoy you. So like, I would never do that.
[00:17:07.880] 是啊，我觉得有时候也是这样。而且我觉得，一段长期恋爱关系的好处之一就是彼此非常了解。有时候我正要做某件事，就会想，这肯定会惹詹姆斯生气。然后我就会想，我不应该那样做。你知道，就是那种淘气淘气的感觉。我相信他也会这样。或者有时候他会说，哦，我差点就那样做了。但我知道那样你会生气。所以我就再也不会那样做了。
[00:17:33.660] And it's like, you learn to navigate away from fights, kind of like sailing a boat or some shit. But in the beginning, like every fight or wrongdoing feels like an utter betrayal and a sign that your relationship isn't going to work out and stuff for dramatic people like me. So I think that's also why it has gotten easier a little bit. I guess like before it was a minefield. And now you have the map. Exactly. That's very true. I think to your point, over time, you start to really get
[00:17:33.660] 就像，你会学会避开争吵，有点像开船什么的。但一开始，每一次争吵或对方的过错都感觉像是彻底的背叛，感觉像是这段感情走不下去的信号，像是我这种情绪化的人才会有的想法。所以我觉得这也是为什么现在情况好转了一些。以前就像踩地雷，现在有了地图。没错，确实如此。我觉得你说得对，随着时间的推移，你会真正开始明白
[00:18:03.560] to know what are certain triggers for the other person. You can almost predict how the other person is going to react. Especially I think when they get in a certain mood, you like know what's going to happen when they're in that mood. You know what I mean? And so I think I've learned to navigate when he's in a certain type of mood, like I shouldn't push him or like pressure him to, yeah, to do something or feel another type of way because it just takes time. Sometimes it just takes
[00:18:03.560] 要了解对方的某些触发点，你几乎可以预测对方的反应。尤其是我觉得当他们处于某种情绪状态时，你几乎可以预判他们接下来会做什么。你明白我的意思吗？所以我觉得我已经学会了如何在他处于某种情绪状态时应对，比如我不应该强迫他或给他施加压力，让他去做某事或产生另一种感觉，因为这需要时间。有时候，这真的需要时间。
[00:18:30.720] time for him to like get out of that mood. And it's like same thing for me. I know that in certain situations, especially with conflict, I'm not really great at dealing with it head on right away. Like I need time to process my thoughts and think about it before I can come back to you with like a logical formed idea. So I think once you start to get to know the person really, really well,
[00:18:30.720] 他需要时间摆脱那种情绪。对我来说也一样。我知道在某些情况下，尤其是在冲突的情况下，我不太擅长立刻正面处理。我需要时间整理思绪，仔细思考，才能带着一个逻辑清晰的想法来回应你。所以我觉得，一旦你真正深入了解一个人，
[00:18:54.520] you can almost kind of predict how those situations are going to go and you can actively avoid them. I think what you said too, you can almost like call it out at the beginning. And so rather than having the situation continue to play out, you can call it out at the very beginning. And you know, it's like a bit meta, right? Like it's like almost breaking the fourth wall in a way. And it sort of diffuses the tension sometimes.
[00:18:54.520] 你几乎可以预测这些情况会如何发展，并主动避免它们。我觉得你说的也很有道理，你几乎可以在一开始就预料到。这样一来，与其让情况继续恶化，不如一开始就把它解决掉。你知道，这有点像是“元叙事”，对吧？某种程度上就像打破了第四面墙。而且，它有时还能缓解紧张气氛。
[00:19:19.620] Yeah, I really like the point too about like, you know, your own personal triggers to the anger thing for me, I think sometimes it's like a defense mechanism. Deep down, I might be like you said, disappointed, but the trigger like the emotion that is quickest is anger. And I think a lot of therapy work has also helped with that. I feel this way now, but what do I really actually feel? And then you know not to go into a conflict, thinking you're angry when actually you're sad, thinking you feel betrayed, but actually you wish that they did this or something.
[00:19:19.620] 是的，我也很赞同你说的，关于个人愤怒触发点这一点。对我来说，我觉得有时候愤怒就像一种防御机制。就像你说的，我内心深处可能很失望，但最先涌现的情绪触发点却是愤怒。我觉得很多心理治疗也帮了我不少忙。我现在感觉是这样，但我真正的感受是什么呢？这样你就知道不要陷入冲突，不要以为自己很生气，其实只是难过；不要以为自己被背叛，其实只是希望他们那样做。
[00:19:48.960] And knowing yourself, knowing them, knowing what kind of communication works between you two as like a pair also helps a lot. I was also thinking while you were describing all this that once you're kind of in that like long-term relationship, it's been a while. I think it also does get easier to bring stuff up. And sometimes you kind of forget how hard it was maybe in the beginning, like how nervous you were to like bring something up. And I think that's such a common thing.
[00:19:48.960] 了解自己，了解对方，知道你们俩之间什么样的沟通方式才有效，这些都很有帮助。在你描述这些的时候，我也在想，一旦你们进入一段长期的恋爱关系，时间久了，我觉得提出问题也会变得更容易。有时候你会忘记当初有多难，比如你当时有多紧张，不敢开口。我觉得这种情况很常见。
[00:20:17.180] And so I guess to combat it, which is once again, easier said than done to just like bring it up no matter what, instead of letting it fester in your mind kind of, oh, I'll just bring it up later when it becomes unbearable. And then I feel like, I feel like if you do it that way, it's easier or more likely to lead to some sort of more explosive reaction or just like something that becomes more dramatic than it needed to be.
[00:20:17.180] 所以我觉得，为了克服这个问题（说起来容易做起来难），最好还是直接提出来，而不是让它在心里慢慢发酵，想着“哦，等到实在忍无可忍的时候再说吧”。我觉得，如果你那样做，更容易引发更激烈的反应，或者让事情变得比原本更戏剧化。
[00:20:45.640] That's a good point. Cause that line of thinking is also like, I'm just going to wait till my absolute breaking point to like address this issue with you, which kind of sets you up for failure a little bit. I think before you kind of find the balance of, you know, when you've been together for so long, you like know each other so well, like before you get to that point, sometimes it's really scary to bring up an issue because you, I don't know. I mean like every relationship is different, but maybe,
[00:20:45.640] 你说得对。因为那种想法就像是，我要等到忍无可忍才跟你谈这件事，这其实有点注定要失败。我觉得在你们找到平衡点之前——你知道，当你们在一起这么久，彼此非常了解之后——在你们达到那个阶段之前，提出问题有时真的很可怕，因为，我不知道。我的意思是，每段感情都不一样，但也许，
[00:21:12.860] you know, some people might have fears of, is this going to hit the breaking point? You might break up because of it, or it might be scary because, because you don't know the other person as well. So you're not sure how they're going to react and if it's going to be like a good conversation or not. So I feel like for me, I would always in the beginning tell myself, I'm chill. Like, this is not a problem. Like it's only a problem because I'm making it a problem,
[00:21:12.860] 你知道，有些人可能会担心，这会不会走到崩溃的边缘？会不会因此分手？或者会不会因为对对方不了解而感到害怕？所以你不确定对方会作何反应，也不知道会不会是一场愉快的对话。所以我觉得，对我来说，一开始我总是会告诉自己，别紧张。这根本不是问题。它之所以会成为问题，只是因为我把它当成了问题。
[00:21:37.620] you know? So as long as I'm cool with it, it's okay. And I would just keep telling myself this over and over again until at some point I hit my breaking point and I'm like, okay, I can't do this anymore. But it's like, obviously I had such, you know, a long time of festering that emotion that now it's like completely blown out of proportion. So you should definitely talk about it
[00:21:37.620] 你知道吗？只要我自己觉得没问题，就没事。我会一遍又一遍地这样告诉自己，直到某个时候我崩溃了，然后我就想，好吧，我再也坚持不下去了。但很明显，我积压了这种情绪太久，现在它完全失控了。所以你一定要好好谈谈这件事。
[00:22:03.020] at the beginning. Dude, I'm chill is so funny. Dude, I feel like that's such a common thought though. You're like, okay, honestly, it wasn't that bad. I'm cool with it. And then eventually, like three months later, you're like, how did we get here? But I think like a good way to kind of think about this is the sooner you bring it up, the sooner you get to know the other person faster. And then to kind of go with the map analogy, like the sooner you map out the map. Do you guys think
[00:22:03.020] 一开始，老兄，我挺放松的，这话真逗。老兄，我觉得这种想法很常见。你会想，好吧，说实话，也没那么糟。我能接受。然后最终，大概三个月后，你会想，我们怎么会走到这一步？但我认为，思考这个问题的一个好方法是，你越早提出这个问题，就能越早了解对方。然后用地图来打个比方，就像你越早绘制地图一样。你们觉得呢？
[00:22:32.340] it would help? And this is so theoretical slash experimental, but there are problems that I think are way easier to talk about. Like, oh, I don't like when you chew with your mouth open, for example. It's like not that offensive, right? And there's problems that are way bigger. Like, oh, I don't like the way you act around your friends where it's like fundamentally, it's like offensive. Do you think it's a good idea to test the waters with an easy fight or an easy
[00:22:32.340] 这样做会有帮助吗？这完全是理论/实验性质的，但有些问题我觉得更容易讨论。比如，我不喜欢你张着嘴嚼东西。这好像不算太冒犯，对吧？但有些问题就严重得多。比如，我不喜欢你和朋友相处的方式，从根本上来说，这很冒犯人。你觉得先从一场简单的争吵或简单的……来试探一下，这个主意怎么样？
[00:22:56.020] conflict first? And then you like, train the algorithm between you two of like a good fight? I never thought of it. Dude, it's literally machine learning. You learn from every fight, you know? And you're the machine. People are AI. Oh my god. You know what, Jisoo,
[00:22:56.020] 先冲突？然后你们俩就用一场酣畅淋漓的争吵来训练算法？我从没想过。老兄，这简直就是机器学习。每次争吵你都能学到东西，懂吗？而你就是那台机器。人就是人工智能。我的天哪。你知道吗，Jisoo，
[00:23:16.460] I'll test out this theory for you. I'll report back later. True. Jisoo will not have another chance to test this out. It's gotta be someone else. I guess maybe, I wonder if most relationships naturally progress in that way. Because like, I guess stuff like, I don't like the way that you act around your friends is probably not something that you're going to even get the chance to witness
[00:23:16.460] 我会帮你验证一下这个理论，之后再汇报。没错，智秀不会再有机会验证这个理论了，肯定是别人。我想，也许大多数感情关系都是这样自然发展的吧。因为，像“我不喜欢你跟朋友相处的方式”这种事，你可能根本没机会亲眼目睹。
[00:23:43.210] until a little bit later in the relationship. It might be stuff like, oh, I don't like how you act around my friends or like around my family, around your family, you know, something like that, where those harder conversations, you know, naturally occur slightly later in the relationship when hopefully you've had a little bit of experience, you know, resolving conflict and issues between you. So, but we'll see about Crystal's data points. Yeah.
[00:23:43.210] 直到关系发展到一定程度才会出现这种情况。可能比如，我不喜欢你和我朋友、我家人、你家人相处的方式，你知道，诸如此类。这些比较难的对话，自然会在关系发展到一定程度后才会出现，那时你们应该已经积累了一些经验，知道如何解决彼此之间的冲突和问题。所以，我们来看看Crystal提供的数据。嗯。
[00:24:08.810] I guess also, it's hard to tell sometimes for like a fresh relationship, because probably both sides are like, I'm chill. We're good. So if someone does bring something up, they might be like, oh, yeah, that's chill. But like, you know, like, maybe it's different if it got brought up, like, say a year later. It's like, it's no longer chill, you know? That's true. Like, some people are like, oh, like, why didn't you tell me sooner?
[00:24:08.810] 我觉得，刚开始交往的时候，有时候很难判断，因为双方可能都觉得“没事，我们很好”。所以如果有人提起这件事，对方可能会说“哦，是啊，没事”。但是，你知道，如果这件事是在一年后提起，情况可能就不一样了。感觉就没那么“没事”了，你知道吗？确实如此。有些人会想，“哎，你为什么不早点告诉我？”
[00:24:37.210] Or this makes me think of too, when I recall like the early stages of our relationship, or like previous relationships, one of the things that happens is when you're kind of, I don't want to say gaslighting, but when you're trying to like calm yourself down from an emotion you feel and tell yourself that it's just all in your head and not a real issue. One of the things I used to do is like text a friend and be like, oh my God, it kind of bothers me when this happens, or like when he does this,
[00:24:37.210] 或者这让我想起，当我回想起我们关系的初期，或者之前的恋爱关系时，其中一件事就是，当你试图让自己平静下来，摆脱某种情绪时，你会有点……我不想说是精神操控，但你会告诉自己这一切都只是你想多了，没什么大不了的。我以前经常会给朋友发短信，说：“天哪，这种情况发生的时候，或者他做这件事的时候，真的让我很困扰。”
[00:25:03.690] what do you think about this issue? And then I would talk to them about it. And that is definitely something that's really helpful in a lot of cases. But sometimes it makes the issue a bigger deal than it is. And then also your friend has a negative perception of your boyfriend now. And that's a really delicate balance that I've really tried to learn over the years of like, how much of this is, you know, me making a space to like vent and get feedback and like advice and
[00:25:03.690] 你对这个问题有什么看法？然后我会和他们谈谈。在很多情况下，这确实很有帮助。但有时候，这会把问题看得比实际更严重。而且，你的朋友现在可能对你男朋友有负面看法。这其中的平衡很难把握，这些年来我一直在努力学习如何平衡，比如，我这样做究竟是想提供一个倾诉、获得反馈和建议的空间，还是……
[00:25:32.210] how much of this is damaging certain bonds or like the perception of my boyfriend with my friends and how much of it is making the deal so much bigger than it is when really it could have been resolved just by like talking to my SO. With a therapist now, I feel like, you know, you can just go to your therapist, like they're never going to meet your SO probably. They're like a truly neutral party and stuff. But like with your friends, you always want to be on the side of your girlfriend, right? It's like, I'm not going to be like, oh, you're toxic AF. I'll be like, oh no, like fuck that
[00:25:32.210] 这件事到底有多少是在破坏某些人际关系，或者影响我朋友对我男朋友的看法？又有多少是在把事情想得太复杂，而实际上只要跟他/她好好谈谈就能解决？现在有了心理咨询师，我觉得，你知道，你可以直接去找咨询师，他们大概永远不会见到你的另一半。他们就像一个真正中立的第三方。但就像对待朋友一样，你总是想站在女朋友那边，对吧？我不会说，哦，你真是太糟糕了。我会说，哦不，去他的。
[00:26:00.730] guy. Or, you know, like at best it's like, oh, maybe try to talk to him. That's probably like the most positive advice. So that's kind of hard too when you try to make the issue too internal. Yeah, that's a good point. Also though, is this just an issue with society? Because I feel like girls try to rationalize issues a lot because they don't want to come off as quote unquote crazy. True. I actually wrote something similar in my journal.
[00:26:00.730] 男生。或者，你知道，最好的建议就是，哦，也许可以试着跟他谈谈。这大概是最积极的建议了。所以，当你试图把问题归结为内部问题时，也很难奏效。嗯，你说得对。不过，这难道只是社会问题吗？因为我觉得女生经常试图理性地看待问题，因为她们不想被人觉得“疯了”。确实如此。我其实也在日记里写过类似的东西。
[00:26:32.090] As I was going through some shit like last year. Okay, I literally wrote in my journal, is this me overcompensating as a woman? Am I being healthy? Or is this considered trying to put his feelings above my own? I think my thought process there was similar to women trying to sort of rationalize their feelings a little bit more, and trying to make things not as big of a deal because we don't want to come off as crazy,
[00:26:32.090] 就像去年我经历了一些糟心事一样。好吧，我甚至在日记里写道，我这样做是不是有点矫情？我这样做健康吗？或者这算不算我把他的感受放在自己感受之上？我觉得我当时的想法和很多女人试图理性地看待自己的感受，试图把事情轻描淡写地带过，因为我们不想显得自己很疯狂。
[00:26:58.990] or being like, you know, that crazy girlfriend or whatever. I think for me in this moment, I was thinking that sometimes women are also, you know, very used to pandering to men's emotions, and trying to kind of play the situation and like, really be in tune with what the other person might be feeling. And so you can either respond to that, you know, and a lot of it comes from like a
[00:26:58.990] 或者就像那种，你知道的，有点疯狂的女朋友之类的。我觉得此刻，我在想，有时候女性也很习惯迎合男性的情绪，试图掌控局面，真正体会对方的感受。所以你可以回应这种回应，你知道，很多时候这都源于……
[00:27:25.650] defensive sort of stance, right? Because you want to protect yourself. And so for me, a part of it was like, oh, am I trying to calm down the situation as much as possible, so that he doesn't get angry, he doesn't, you know, feel annoyed or anything like that. And that's kind of like a red alert going off in my head, right? Or is this like a true problem that deserves both of us to talk about it?
[00:27:25.650] 这是一种防御姿态，对吧？因为你想保护自己。所以对我来说，一部分原因是，哦，我是否应该尽可能地缓和局势，以免他生气，或者感到恼火之类的。这就像我脑子里拉响了红色警报，对吧？或者这真的是一个值得我们俩好好谈谈的问题？
[00:27:51.290] Am I overcompensating this? Or is this just me trying to, is this like a real issue? You know? Right. Yeah, I totally feel that because I feel like there's so many thoughts that run through your head. And I don't know if guys necessarily think so deeply and like long term, and feel as much as like women tend to, but it's like you're trying to calculate, is this a real issue or not? But I think like long term, this is someone who is like your life partner, sort of. So like getting you and
[00:27:51.290] 我是不是反应过度了？还是我只是想……这真的是个问题吗？你知道吗？对。是啊，我完全能理解，因为我觉得脑子里会冒出很多想法。我不知道男生是不是也像女生那样，会想得那么深，那么注重长远，那么感性，但感觉就像你在权衡，这到底是不是个问题？但我觉得从长远来看，这个人就像你的终身伴侣，某种程度上来说。所以，就像你和……
[00:28:19.690] your partner to that stage where you talk about these things is like the ultimate challenge of like a healthy relationship. It's like, how can we deal with conflict together in a way that's constructive and pushes us forward and doesn't hold us back? Mm hmm. I think one of the realizations for me is like, I can be a pretty sensitive person. You know, I've been working out a lot of things through therapy. There's so many times where I feel like really validated in my emotions. And then later when I think about it, and I'm not in
[00:28:19.690] 和伴侣发展到可以谈论这些事情的地步，这可以说是健康关系中最大的挑战。这就像，我们如何以一种建设性的方式共同处理冲突，推动彼此进步而不是阻碍彼此？嗯。我觉得我意识到的一点是，我其实是个很敏感的人。你知道，我一直在通过心理治疗来解决很多问题。很多时候，我的情绪都得到了充分的理解和认同。但之后当我回想起来，我并没有真正投入其中。
[00:28:48.390] my emotional spiral, I'm like, oh, I definitely overreacted. So mine is probably the opposite of what Jessica was going through. I was like, okay, I do need to reel it back because I can't just be like, lack of a better word, picking fights all the time, sort of with like the person I love the most. And my therapist was like, are you bringing up issues at like nighttime in bed when he's like about to fall asleep? And then that's when my emotions are the highest probably. And that's when
[00:28:48.390] 我的情绪陷入了漩涡，我心想，哦，我肯定反应过度了。所以我的情况可能和杰西卡的正好相反。我当时想，好吧，我确实需要控制一下，因为我不能总是这样，用一个不太恰当的词来说，总是挑起争端，尤其是和我的挚爱之人。我的心理咨询师问我，你是不是会在晚上他快要睡着的时候，在床上提起这些事？那时候我的情绪可能最激动。
[00:29:15.850] his emotional capacity is the lowest, right? And then I was like, I am. And she was like, let's not do that. And I was like, okay. And then after I switched that, I feel like it did fix things. So I think for us, like sometimes the fix is simple, but if you think about it, it's like being considerate about the other person and also setting yourself up for success for the fight, sort of. Kind of a different issue from yours, Jessica, but the opposite spectrum a
[00:29:15.850] 他的情绪承受能力是最低的，对吧？然后我就说，我也是。她就说，我们别那样。我说，好吧。之后我改变了想法，感觉事情确实解决了。所以我觉得对我们来说，有时候解决办法很简单，但仔细想想，这就像是既要体谅对方，又要为接下来的争吵做好准备。这跟你的问题有点不一样，杰西卡，但却是截然相反的情况。
[00:29:41.090] little bit. Whoa, that's so interesting. Yeah, I actually do relay a little bit because for the last year and a half, we've been LDR, obviously. A lot of the fights, we all not, you know, like whenever we have stuff to talk about, you know, talk through, it's always through FaceTime or like calling, right? Which is obviously not the best medium to do it, but there's no other option. I guess for the listeners who don't know, he's currently in med
[00:29:41.090] 有点儿。哇，真有意思。是啊，我确实会稍微透露一点儿，因为过去一年半我们一直异地恋。很多时候，我们吵架，你知道，就像我们有什么事要谈，要好好沟通的时候，总是通过 FaceTime 或者打电话，对吧？这显然不是最好的方式，但也没有别的办法。我想可能有些听众不知道，他目前正在接受治疗。
[00:30:09.050] school and he obviously has a very rigorous and busy schedule all the time. So he like gets up really early and he'll come home really late. And it's pretty much he's at the clinic or the hospital and then he comes home, he eats, he works out and he like talks to me and then just goes to sleep. Although sometimes he, you know, he still has time to get, but anyway, that aside, but there were, I know, right? Bombastic cyanide.
[00:30:09.050] 他上学，而且他的日程安排非常紧凑繁忙。所以他起得很早，回家也很晚。基本上，他一会儿在诊所，一会儿在医院，然后回家，吃饭，锻炼，跟我聊聊天，然后就睡觉了。虽然有时候他还是会抽出时间，但不管怎样，先不说这些，我知道，对吧？夸张的氰化物。
[00:30:40.590] But there were a couple times where there were issues that I wanted to bring up and I'm thinking about it all day at work, you know, and I'm like going about my day thinking about it and it's like, oh great. Now he's finally home from work. Like now we can hop on FaceTime and talk about it. But it didn't occur to me until we actually went through this that like, oh, he's coming back from a really, really long work day. Like he's exhausted. He's really tired. And if I try to sort of push this,
[00:30:40.590] 但有好几次，我想提一些问题，结果一整天上班都在想，你知道吗？我一边工作一边想着这些事，然后就想，哦，太好了，他终于下班回家了。现在我们可以视频通话聊聊了。但直到我们真正经历这些的时候，我才意识到，哦，他今天工作了一整天，累坏了，真的非常疲惫。如果我试图强迫他，
[00:31:10.510] it's not conducive to having a really good conversation about what's wrong. And he's also, I think somebody who just shuts down naturally when he's really tired. And so that also just doesn't help the situation. So instead we picked like a better time to recall and like re-talk about it where he's not super tired after a really, really long day. Well, it is difficult because
[00:31:10.510] 这种情况不利于我们好好谈谈到底出了什么问题。而且，我觉得他特别累的时候就会自然而然地封闭自己。所以，这也让情况雪上加霜。因此，我们选择了一个更好的时间，在他一天工作下来不太累的时候，再重新讨论一下这件事。嗯，这确实很困难，因为
[00:31:36.190] obviously we both work and we both have a pretty like rigid schedule in terms of like when and when we're not available. So it's a little bit more limited, but definitely to your point of like, you know, not picking fights at when your partner is the most like vulnerable and like tired and like has no emotional capacity to deal with it is probably, you know. It's a good tip. It's like kind of a simple tip in the grand scheme of things, but so easy to overlook because when you're
[00:31:36.190] 显然我们俩都有工作，而且我们的时间安排都相当固定，有的有空，有的没空。所以时间确实比较有限，但你说的没错，不要在伴侣最脆弱、最疲惫、最无力应对的时候挑起争端，这确实是个好建议。从长远来看，这似乎是个很简单的建议，但却很容易被忽略，因为当你……
[00:32:03.870] like in your feels, you're just focused on your feelings. And so it's so easy to be like, oh, we need to talk about this now because it's bothering me so much. But then the better course of action is to choose like a really appropriate time for everyone. Dude, I'm just imagining like Vince on a run and he's like waiting until he gets that runner's high. And as soon as he gets it, he's like, okay, this is the perfect time to address this conflit.
[00:32:03.870] 就像你情绪激动的时候，你只会专注于自己的感受。所以很容易就会想，哦，我们现在必须谈谈这件事，因为它让我很困扰。但更好的做法是选择一个对大家都合适的时机。老兄，我脑补了一下文斯跑步的画面，他等到自己达到跑步带来的快感时，就会想，好了，现在正是解决这个冲突的最佳时机。
[00:32:30.790] It's like, I'm at my happiest. Like Jessica, it's like still early. We're going to talk about this now. Oh my God. I would probably be like, what the fuck? And also he always listens to audiobooks when he runs. So he would never call me. So kind of off on a tangent from like actual arguments or discussions, do you think there's
[00:32:30.790] 感觉我现在特别开心。就像杰西卡说的，现在还早。我们现在就来聊聊这个。我的天哪。我可能会想，搞什么鬼？而且他跑步的时候总是听有声书。所以他从来不会给我打电话。所以，稍微跑题一下，不谈真正的争论或讨论，你觉得……
[00:32:58.030] been any like healthy habits actually that you've picked up from your partner or you've seen your partner do that you're like, oh, you know what? I should start doing that too. Yeah. I think there's a couple of things that I've learned from James over the years. And I think I learned these things more intimately after we started living together because when we weren't living together, it's mostly like dates or hanging out and stuff like that. But
[00:32:58.030] 有没有什么健康的生活习惯，是你从伴侣那里学到的，或者你看到伴侣做的，让你觉得“哦，我也应该开始这样做”？是的。我觉得这些年来我从詹姆斯身上学到了一些东西。而且我觉得自从我们开始同居之后，我才更深入地了解了这些，因为当我们不住在一起的时候，我们之间的互动大多只是约会或者出去玩之类的。
[00:33:24.450] when you're living together, there's so many more things that you see about your partner and so many more things you learn about his like mindset or how his like brain works pretty much. So I've kind of talked a little bit about how my emotions can be a little trigger happy sometimes. You know, sometimes when I feel something, I feel it intensely and the action that triggered it might be pretty bitimal. I just like go into like a thought spiral where
[00:33:24.450] 当你和伴侣住在一起时，你会看到更多关于他/她的事情，也会更多地了解他的思维方式，或者说他的大脑是如何运作的。我之前也稍微提到过，我的情绪有时会比较容易被触发。你知道，有时候当我感受到某种情绪时，我会感觉非常强烈，而触发这种情绪的事情可能非常微不足道。我就会陷入一种思维漩涡，不断地思考。
[00:33:49.990] it's not productive at all. And I'm just like hyper focused on it. It like ruins the rest of my day pretty much when in reality, it might not have much intention from the other person, you know, to and from hangouts or like events or things like that. When James and I are in the car, I might be like, Oh, this person said this thing that really offended me. And I feel like they said this because they have this impression of me. And their intention was this I have a whole fucking
[00:33:49.990] 这完全没用。我却总是过度关注这件事。它几乎毁了我一天剩下的时间，但实际上，对方可能并没有什么恶意，你知道，比如在聚会或活动之类的场合。当我和詹姆斯在车里时，我可能会想，哦，这个人说了些话，真的让我很生气。我觉得他们这么说是因为他们对我有某种印象。他们的意图是……我简直……
[00:34:16.410] thesis in my head for no reason about this thing. Because that's just how my brain works sometimes. And James will be like, Oh, maybe they were just having a bad day, because they mentioned that this happened earlier in the day, you can't really be happy after something like that. So don't worry about it. And at first, I would be like, you're just like, invalidating my emotions. And it like, hurts my feelings, because you're not hearing what I'm saying, like, this was really offensive. And then later, I was like, that's so true. Because like, imagine how many people I've pissed
[00:34:16.410] 我脑子里会莫名其妙地冒出一个关于这件事的论点。因为我的脑子有时候就是这样运转的。然后詹姆斯会说，哦，也许他们只是那天心情不好，因为他们提到这件事发生在当天早些时候，经历了那种事之后，你很难真的开心。所以别担心。一开始，我会觉得，你简直是在否定我的感受。这真的伤了我的心，因为你根本没听进去我说的话，比如，这件事真的很伤人。但后来，我又觉得，你说得太对了。因为想想看，我到底惹恼了多少人……
[00:34:44.770] off when I'm just in a bad mood. And I'm just trying to go home or something. And I say something like, that comes off Kurt, and it really meant nothing. I was just fucking tired. So I think that kind of mindset really helped me a lot, where I'm like, Okay, let's not freak out over nothing. And just channel my inner James, where he does not give a fuck. He's so chill. And when he's offended, he almost like laughs it off is like, Oh, well, that's on the other person anyway. We can all channel our inner James. Yeah.
[00:34:44.770] 我心情不好的时候就会这样。我只想回家什么的。然后我会说一些像库尔特会说的话，其实没什么别的意思。我当时只是累得要死。所以我觉得这种心态真的帮了我很多，我会想，好吧，别为小事大惊小怪。然后就学学詹姆斯，他根本不在乎别人的看法。他太冷静了。就算他被冒犯了，他也会一笑置之，说，哦，反正那是别人的问题。我们都可以学学詹姆斯。没错。
[00:35:16.550] It's just it's just so easy and fun to spiral. I know. It's the path of least resistance. How about you guys? Okay, I think there are definitely a lot of healthy mindsets and habits that I've seen him display.
[00:35:16.550] 就是很容易陷入恶性循环，而且很有趣。我知道。这是阻力最小的路。你们觉得呢？好吧，我觉得他确实展现出了很多健康的心态和习惯。
[00:35:37.510] I don't know how many of them have rubbed off on me a lot. But I can say that I appreciate a lot of different habits and like mindsets that he has. And I really, really appreciate his way of sort of like looking at life. I think one of them is like, he's a very intrinsically motivated person. That's kind of why I say like, I don't know how many of them have like, actually rubbed off on me, because some of
[00:35:37.510] 我不知道他身上有多少特质真正影响了我。但我可以说，我很欣赏他身上很多不同的习惯和思维方式。我尤其欣赏他看待生活的方式。我觉得其中一点就是，他是一个非常有内在动力的人。这就是为什么我说，我不知道他身上有多少特质真正影响了我，因为有些……
[00:36:04.930] them is just like, I feel like you can't choose to be intrinsically motivated. It's just you just kind of are. And I am not intrinsically motivated. But he's a type of person where once he decides to live a certain way, or like integrate something into his life, he has no problem doing it. He has no problem following through. And I think that while you know, I can't change myself being like,
[00:36:04.930] 我觉得，你无法选择是否拥有内在动力，它就是与生俱来的。而我恰恰缺乏内在动力。但他属于那种一旦决定以某种方式生活，或者将某件事融入生活，就能坚持到底的人。他能毫不费力地做到。我觉得，虽然我无法改变自己，但我就是那种……
[00:36:32.930] you know, I need certain external motivations to get me going. But I think it does inspire me a lot to kind of see the world in a different way and sort of to not be as afraid of taking action sometimes. And it does inspire me to kind of see that like, you know, if I really wanted to do something, I can just do it. Like I can just sit down or go out or like stand up or whatever verb, and I can just go do it. And I think he embodies that a lot. Another thing that I thought about
[00:36:32.930] 你知道，我需要一些外部动力才能行动起来。但我认为，用不同的视角看待世界，不再那么害怕采取行动，确实能给我带来很多启发。它也激励我意识到，如果我真的想做某件事，我就可以去做。我可以坐下来，也可以出门，或者站起来，或者用任何动词，我都可以去做。我认为他很好地体现了这一点。我还想到另一件事……
[00:37:01.830] that I do think has rubbed off on me quite a bit is that he is like the most non judgmental person I've ever met. Like he is so good at just taking things at face value and just not putting any stories behind why someone did something or like why something is the way that it is like it just
[00:37:01.830] 我觉得他身上对我影响最大的一点是，他是我见过最不带偏见的人。他很擅长接受事物的本来面目，不会去深究别人做某件事的原因，也不会去探究事情为什么会这样。
[00:37:27.890] is. Even when people are like rude or offensive or doing something that's like kind of weird. I think there's pros and cons to that, obviously. And I always tell him that like, you know, you need to do a better job of breeding people. You're very gullible. But I think at the same time, I mean, I admire it a lot where it's like, he can see people just like, as people and he doesn't come with any sort of preconceptions about whatever, or this person is like this type of person because
[00:37:27.890] 是的。即使别人很粗鲁、很冒犯，或者做了些有点奇怪的事情。我觉得这当然有利有弊。我总是跟他说，你得好好培养一下自己的人脉。你太容易轻信别人了。但同时，我也很欣赏他这一点，他能把人当人看待，不会带着任何先入为主的观念，也不会觉得这个人就是那种人。
[00:37:56.830] they, they did this, this and this. He finds a lot of humor in that. I think after meeting him, I've also tried to and sort of naturally also just found a lot more humor in living life in general, and found things that maybe previously I would have been, oh, like why this the way that it is? Or like, why did this person do this? But instead, I'll kind of be like, oh, wow,
[00:37:56.830] 他们，他们做了这个、那个和那个。他觉得这很有趣。我想自从认识他之后，我也试着，而且很自然地，在生活中发现了很多乐趣，也发现了一些以前我可能会想“哦，为什么会这样？”或者“这个人为什么要这样做？”的事情。但现在，我会想，“哦，哇……”
[00:38:23.670] like I can't believe this person did that. Like, that's so cringe and funny. And like, I mean, maybe not cringe, because that's kind of judgmental. But you know, like, it's just like, oh, it's like a funny thing that happened. And it's not good or bad. It just is. And I think that's something that, yeah, I really admire about him. I really love that. Because I think that's one of the ways that your partner can really bleed into your life in a positive way, where it's like, you and him have completely different worldviews,
[00:38:23.670] 我简直不敢相信这个人会做出这种事。真是又尴尬又好笑。嗯，也许说尴尬有点武断，但你知道，这就像是，哦，发生了一件挺搞笑的事。它既不好也不坏，就是发生了。我觉得这一点，是的，我真的很欣赏他。我真的很喜欢这一点。因为我觉得这是伴侣能够以积极的方式融入你生活的一种途径，即使你们拥有完全不同的世界观，
[00:38:53.650] and maybe like different attitudes about certain things. And the way you bring out the positives in each other, and maybe complement each other a little bit, is kind of the embodiment of like how a really good, well functioning relationship works. You're not judging him for his worldview, and he's not judging you. But you bring out the balance in each other a little bit. And especially like finding a partner who makes you see the world in a more positive way. That's like not an easy feat,
[00:38:53.650] 或许你们对某些事情的态度也不同。你们互相激发对方的优点，互相补充，这正是真正良好、运转良好的关系的体现。你不会评判他的世界观，他也不会评判你。你们彼此之间会找到平衡。尤其重要的是，找到一个能让你以更积极的方式看待世界的伴侣。这可不是件容易的事。
[00:39:20.090] because that's like your base view sort of. So I really like that one. How about you, Crystal? I've been kind of thinking, maybe like, similar to what we've all been saying, kind of just like a positive attitude in general, I think is just like nice to see. I think being very encouraging, along with that positive attitude is also something that's just like, very appreciated. And I think when
[00:39:20.090] 因为那就像是你的基本观点。所以我很喜欢这一点。你呢，Crystal？我一直在想，也许就像我们一直在说的，积极的态度总体来说，我觉得很令人欣慰。我觉得鼓励他人，再加上积极的态度，也非常值得赞赏。而且我觉得当
[00:39:49.670] you're exposed to that enough, it helps you start to think in those ways as well and kind of give it back as well. So it becomes a feedback loop. So then hopefully, you and your partner are just like encouraging each other with like good vibes to do what needs to be done. All right. So as a closing question, I have one for y'all. What are some indicators,
[00:39:49.670] 你接触到这些的次数多了，就会开始用同样的方式思考，并反过来影响对方。这样就形成了一个反馈循环。希望你和你的伴侣能够互相鼓励，传递积极的能量，去做该做的事情。好的。最后一个问题，我想问问大家：有哪些迹象表明……
[00:40:18.090] especially earlier on in the relationship where you're like, yes, okay, this relationship is now healthy, or it has potential to be really healthy in the future? I think in the beginning, if you get like, genuine care and concern from each other, where it's like, I want to make sure that like, this is going well. And like, I want to make sure that you feel good about this relationship. They don't have to explicitly say that. But like,
[00:40:18.090] 尤其是在恋爱初期，你会觉得，嗯，这段关系现在很健康，或者未来很有发展潜力？我觉得在恋爱初期，如果彼此都能感受到真挚的关心和重视，比如对方会想：“我想确保这段关系进展顺利，我想确保你对这段关系感到满意。”他们不必把这些话说得那么明白，但就是会感受到这种真挚的关心和重视。
[00:40:46.170] if you can see the actions and like, see the direction of that general sentiment, then I feel like those are some pretty good signs in the beginning. I think on that note, too, similarly, I think it's a very tight balance. But being willing to have like mutual sacrifices. Because I think a lot of people have like a misconception that in a relationship,
[00:40:46.170] 如果你能看到对方的行动，也能感受到这种总体情绪的发展方向，我觉得这在初期就是非常好的迹象。同样地，我认为这种平衡很难把握。双方都愿意做出牺牲。因为我觉得很多人对一段感情存在误解，认为……
[00:41:15.650] both people need to make sacrifices for each other, or it has to be like very balanced or something like that. But I feel like in reality, there are times when one person has to sacrifice a little more than the other person. And then that may switch where the other person will have to sacrifice a little more for the sake of your lives together or the relationship or some person's like some one
[00:41:15.650] 双方都需要为对方做出牺牲，或者说，这种牺牲必须非常平衡才行。但我觉得在现实生活中，有时候一方需要比另一方付出更多。然后情况可能会反过来，另一方为了你们共同的生活、这段关系，或者为了某个人（比如其他人）的利益，也需要做出更多牺牲。
[00:41:42.630] person circumstances or whatever. And I think it is always switching up and changing depending just on like more macro factors. But I think it's the willingness to do that for each other. And to not count tallies in your head, where you're like, Oh, I did this for you. So I'm expecting something in return. When you're both willing to make sacrifices for each other and support each other in whatever
[00:41:42.630] 个人情况或其他因素都会影响结果。我认为情况总是在不断变化，取决于一些更宏观的因素。但我认为关键在于彼此是否愿意为对方付出。不要在心里斤斤计较，想着“我为你做了这些，所以期待你的回报”。当你们都愿意为对方做出牺牲，并在任何方面互相支持时，一切就变得不同了。
[00:42:08.990] capacity the other person needs, and not have it be like a competition or like something where you're seeking something in return, I think is very much pointing towards like a healthy relationship. Oh, I have a funny one. There's this trend that's going on on TikTok. It's called the three month rule, which is basically when you start talking to someone or like start going on dates or whatever,
[00:42:08.990] 了解对方的需求，而不是把它变成一场竞争或者寻求回报，我认为这才是健康关系的关键。哦，我有个有趣的例子。TikTok 上有个很火的趋势，叫“三个月法则”，基本上就是当你开始和某人聊天、约会什么的……
[00:42:37.950] you should wait until three months or later to see if they're still like nice to you and like things are still going well. Because the theory is that if someone were faking it, they wouldn't have the willpower to like keep faking it beyond three months. And then that's when they're like true self would come out. So I guess that's like if they last longer than three months, then that could potentially be a good sign.
[00:42:37.950] 你应该等三个月甚至更久，看看他们是否还对你友好，一切是否进展顺利。因为理论上讲，如果有人在伪装，他们不可能坚持伪装超过三个月。那时，他们的真面目就会显露出来。所以我觉得，如果他们能维持三个月以上，那可能就是个好兆头。
[00:43:06.710] I kind of like that one because it does tie in a little bit to the one I was thinking, which is consistency. I've been in relationships in the past where there was love or like some sort of deviation of love. But I think people call it love bombing now where it's like the love was really intense some parts and the other parts they didn't give a fuck or like maybe I didn't give a fuck or something. And it's like, I just couldn't envision like long termness in that relationship,
[00:43:06.710] 我挺喜欢这个说法，因为它跟我之前想的有点关系，那就是“稳定”。我以前谈过恋爱，有过爱情，或者说爱情有点偏差。但我觉得现在人们把这种关系叫做“情感轰炸”，就是有时候爱得特别浓烈，有时候又完全不在乎，或者可能是我不在乎之类的。在这种情况下，我根本无法想象这段感情能长久。
[00:43:34.090] right? Because there's so many big swings, ups and downs. I think with James, he's like a very consistent person. And I'm like slightly inconsistent because of like mood swings and hormones and whatnot. But it like works. And I've learned to like try to be a little bit more consistent. So I think that goes along a little bit with like dependability, really feeling like, you know, the other person instead of like 50-50, they will love me today or they won't love me today. So that kind of trust,
[00:43:34.090] 对吧？因为情绪波动太大了，有起有落。我觉得詹姆斯是个很稳定的人。而我有点不稳定，因为情绪波动、荷尔蒙什么的都会影响我。但我们相处得还不错。我已经学会努力让自己更稳定一些。我觉得这跟可靠性有点关系，就是真正感觉对方会信任我，而不是那种五五开、今天爱我今天不爱我的感觉。这种信任，
