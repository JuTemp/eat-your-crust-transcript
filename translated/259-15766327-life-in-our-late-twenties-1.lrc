[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:04.360] And I'm Jimmy
[00:00:04.360] 我是吉米
[00:00:16.250] Welcome back Jimmy the last time you were on the podcast was episode
[00:00:16.250] 欢迎吉米回归！你上次做客播客节目是第 11 集。
[00:00:20.430] 2018 and 2019 which was a two-parter about breakups
[00:00:20.430] 2018 年和 2019 年，这是一部关于分手的两部分剧集。
[00:00:25.810] Which I think was very fun to record episode and also fun to listen to episode
[00:00:25.810] 我觉得录制这期节目很有趣，听这期节目也很有趣。
[00:00:31.310] So today we're really excited to have Jimmy back because we have a topic that I feel like might be relevant for a lot of our listeners
[00:00:31.310] 今天我们非常高兴吉米再次做客，因为我们今天要聊的话题我觉得可能和很多听众都息息相关。
[00:00:38.290] Which is life in our late twenties
[00:00:38.290] 这就是我们二十多岁时的生活。
[00:00:41.370] Crystal and I talk often about how our age and changes in our age affect our lifestyle and our values and really just the way we look at life
[00:00:41.370] 我和克丽丝塔尔经常谈论年龄以及年龄变化如何影响我们的生活方式、价值观，以及我们看待生活的方式。
[00:00:51.910] So today we wanted to kind of dive into that
[00:00:51.910] 所以今天我们想深入探讨一下这个问题。
[00:00:55.030] So let's kick this off by talking about how our lifestyle has changed over the years in our twenties
[00:00:55.030] 那么，让我们先来聊聊我们二十多岁时生活方式发生的这些变化吧。
[00:01:02.190] Do you think life right now looks really different from life when we were 22-23?
[00:01:02.190] 你觉得现在的生活和我们22、23岁时的生活有很大的不同吗？
[00:01:07.750] Fuck yeah it does
[00:01:07.750] 没错，确实如此。
[00:01:09.510] The listeners can't really see but I got some nice decor now
[00:01:09.510] 听众们可能看不清，但我现在添置了一些不错的装饰品。
[00:01:14.090] My walls and everything
[00:01:14.090] 我的墙壁和一切
[00:01:15.430] But I'm a grown-ass adult
[00:01:15.430] 但我已经是个成年人了。
[00:01:17.730] I got like a nice hobby
[00:01:17.730] 我有个不错的爱好
[00:01:19.570] And stuff you know that I spend a lot of time with
[00:01:19.570] 还有一些你知道我花很多时间做的事情
[00:01:23.190] I'm a whiteboard with
[00:01:23.190] 我是一块白板
[00:01:24.450] Oh it used to have all my errands on it but I'm a grown-ass adult so I've done the ball
[00:01:24.450] 哦，以前上面记着我所有的待办事项，但我已经是个成年人了，所以已经不再用了。
[00:01:30.130] I think early twenties is for sure just like a developmental phase of your life
[00:01:30.130] 我认为二十出头绝对是人生的一个发展阶段。
[00:01:36.450] Where you're just trying to figure out how to do basic shit the kids call it like adulting
[00:01:36.450] 你只是想弄明白怎么做孩子们口中所谓的“成人礼”这种基本的事情。
[00:01:42.490] Right so you try learning how to adult in all that
[00:01:42.490] 所以，你试着学习如何在这一切中做一个成年人。
[00:01:45.730] Winger what it's just like you prefer a clean house, you prefer your sleep, you prefer
[00:01:45.730] Winger，就像你喜欢干净的房子，你喜欢睡个好觉，你喜欢……一样
[00:01:51.750] Making sure you're alright individually
[00:01:51.750] 确保你个人一切安好。
[00:01:53.930] Whereas when I was a rump, I was just as early twenties dude
[00:01:53.930] 而当我还是个毛头小子的时候，我才二十出头呢。
[00:01:59.110] I did not take care of myself
[00:01:59.110] 我没有好好照顾自己。
[00:02:01.910] Oh you guys know you guys been in my house
[00:02:01.910] 哦，你们知道你们来过我家。
[00:02:03.770] I lived with all dudes
[00:02:03.770] 我跟全是男生住在一起。
[00:02:05.270] We wouldn't do the dishes until like fucking mold started growing on
[00:02:05.270] 我们从来不洗碗，直到碗上都长霉了才洗。
[00:02:09.550] It was disgusting
[00:02:09.550] 真恶心
[00:02:13.430] We'd have like you know full-ass trash bags
[00:02:13.430] 我们会准备那种像垃圾袋一样的东西。
[00:02:16.210] Just leave it at the door because people are too lazy to take it out
[00:02:16.210] 就把它放在门口吧，因为人们懒得拿出来。
[00:02:19.410] Dude
[00:02:19.410] 哥们
[00:02:20.890] Just disgusting man
[00:02:20.890] 真是个令人作呕的男人
[00:02:22.030] And then we would smoke weed like all day
[00:02:22.030] 然后我们就会整天抽大麻。
[00:02:26.290] But times have changed
[00:02:26.290] 但时代已经改变了。
[00:02:27.750] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:02:27.750] 是啊，是啊，是啊
[00:02:29.870] I always smoke weed all night
[00:02:29.870] 我总是整晚抽大麻
[00:02:33.950] There are elements, bits and pieces of that
[00:02:33.950] 这其中包含一些要素、片段和部分。
[00:02:36.030] But I could definitely relate to
[00:02:36.030] 但我绝对能感同身受。
[00:02:37.650] But I feel like one of the biggest things that I can point to is
[00:02:37.650] 但我感觉我能指出的最重要的一点是
[00:02:41.890] I almost feel like it took me the last eight years to realize what the consequences of certain actions are
[00:02:41.890] 我感觉自己花了整整八年时间才意识到某些行为的后果。
[00:02:47.850] So if in my early twenties everything came to me as a surprise
[00:02:47.850] 所以，如果说在我二十出头的时候，一切都让我感到惊讶……
[00:02:51.610] Like oh why am I so tired without me thinking oh it's because I sleep at 2 a.m every day
[00:02:51.610] 比如，我会想“为什么我这么累？”，但我却没想过“哦，那是因为我每天凌晨两点才睡”。
[00:02:56.870] But now I feel like I'm very conscious of it
[00:02:56.870] 但现在我感觉自己对此非常在意。
[00:02:59.370] And that doesn't necessarily mean I'm always good at keeping up a routine or structure that benefits me
[00:02:59.370] 但这并不意味着我总是能很好地保持对我有益的作息或作息规律。
[00:03:05.170] But at least I know I can't be doing X, Y and Z without expecting to have ABC happen the next day
[00:03:05.170] 但至少我知道，如果我做了X、Y和Z，就不能指望第二天ABC就会发生。
[00:03:13.050] So that has been a huge change for me
[00:03:13.050] 所以这对我来说是一个巨大的改变。
[00:03:16.090] Yeah, and I think our body just changes to in college and high school
[00:03:16.090] 是的，我觉得我们的身体在大学和高中时期会发生变化。
[00:03:21.450] Pulling an ulnar was not really a big deal
[00:03:21.450] 尺骨拉伤其实没什么大不了的。
[00:03:24.230] Your little tire the next day but you can recover pretty quickly
[00:03:24.230] 第二天你的小轮胎可能会有点疼，但你可以很快恢复。
[00:03:27.050] But now I can definitely feel like if I were to pull an ulnar I need at least like two days to recover
[00:03:27.050] 但我现在可以肯定地说，如果我拉伤了尺骨，至少需要两天时间才能恢复。
[00:03:32.970] Oh my god, yeah
[00:03:32.970] 我的天啊，是的
[00:03:35.170] So I have a thing I have done this my entire life where when I have a red eye flight
[00:03:35.170] 我有个习惯，我这辈子一直都这么做，那就是当我坐红眼航班的时候。
[00:03:39.750] I will always pull all nighter the night before so I could pass out
[00:03:39.750] 我总是会在前一天晚上熬夜，这样我就可以睡着了。
[00:03:45.350] Not the entire flight right recently actually last weekend
[00:03:45.350] 并非整个航班，实际上就在上周末。
[00:03:49.030] I went to Turks for my friends wedding and I did all nighter
[00:03:49.030] 我去特克斯参加朋友的婚礼，结果熬了个通宵。
[00:03:53.850] I had the red eye but I went on it the fucking flight attendant
[00:03:53.850] 我坐的是红眼航班，但我还是上了，该死的空乘人员
[00:03:58.750] I don't know why I had a empty middle seat I was the IOC
[00:03:58.750] 我不知道为什么我的中间座位空着，我可是国际奥委会主席啊。
[00:04:02.770] This flight attendant kept waking me up to sit in the middle seat
[00:04:02.770] 这位空乘人员一直叫醒我，让我坐到中间的座位上。
[00:04:06.210] Oh my god
[00:04:06.210] 我的天啊
[00:04:07.950] Right and it looks like literally every three minutes and not just like a gentle like excuse me
[00:04:07.950] 对，而且看起来几乎每隔三分钟就发生一次，不是那种轻声的“对不起”之类的。
[00:04:13.830] Can I get back?
[00:04:13.830] 我可以回去吗？
[00:04:14.630] It's like a aggressive dash shake on my shoulder
[00:04:14.630] 就像有人用力地摇晃我的肩膀一样
[00:04:18.210] Vice group on my shoulder like excuse me I need to get through
[00:04:18.210] Vice 小组在我肩头说：“不好意思，我得过去。”
[00:04:21.770] What the fuck is going on?
[00:04:21.770] 这他妈到底是怎么回事？
[00:04:23.750] I thought they provided facilities for these five and ten days
[00:04:23.750] 我以为他们会为这五天和十天提供设施。
[00:04:26.910] God damn and not only that too she wasn't sleeping when she sat in the middle seat
[00:04:26.910] 该死，不仅如此，她坐在中间座位上的时候竟然没睡觉。
[00:04:32.410] She was legit like eating chips and shit like rustling bags or whatnot
[00:04:32.410] 她真的就像在吃薯片之类的东西，发出沙沙的袋子声什么的。
[00:04:37.230] God damn
[00:04:37.230] 该死的
[00:04:39.090] But I was like I had pulled all nighter before so I wasn't coherent
[00:04:39.090] 但我当时就像之前熬过一个通宵一样，所以思路很混乱。
[00:04:44.430] I wasn't able to form words and speak my mind
[00:04:44.430] 我无法组织语言，也无法表达自己的想法。
[00:04:47.670] I just fucking took it
[00:04:47.670] 我他妈的就拿走了
[00:04:50.370] You know I didn't I didn't go no stop. I don't like it
[00:04:50.370] 你知道我没有，我没有停下来。我不喜欢这样。
[00:04:56.170] You let her bully you. I let her bully me. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry
[00:04:56.170] 你让她欺负你。我也让她欺负我。哦，是啊，我很抱歉。
[00:05:03.550] The one time I kidded because the tree was down and I was resting on the tree
[00:05:03.550] 那次我开玩笑是因为树倒了，我正靠在树上休息。
[00:05:08.190] And so I was trying to put up the tree so that she could get through
[00:05:08.190] 所以我当时正努力把树立起来，好让她能穿过去。
[00:05:11.330] And she was like don't know what I'm worried about it. She fucking slams the tree
[00:05:11.330] 她好像在说，我也不知道我在担心什么。然后她猛地一摔那棵树。
[00:05:15.290] And just bodies her way through
[00:05:15.290] 她一路横冲直撞
[00:05:17.750] Oh my god
[00:05:17.750] 我的天啊
[00:05:19.050] Dude and we're far too. She fucking and command deers the armrest too
[00:05:19.050] 兄弟，我们离得太远了。她他妈的还命令鹿把扶手也弄坏了。
[00:05:25.070] Oh no, yeah
[00:05:25.070] 哦不，是的
[00:05:27.050] Wait that's actually crazy. I thought they usually saved seats in the back for flight attendants
[00:05:27.050] 等等，这简直太离谱了。我以为他们通常会把座位放在后面给空乘人员坐。
[00:05:32.690] Right I thought so too. Oh no man
[00:05:32.690] 对，我也这么想。哦，天哪
[00:05:35.430] I told us to other people and they're like oh dude maybe she has a crush on you
[00:05:35.430] 我把这事告诉了其他人，他们都说，哦兄弟，说不定她暗恋你呢。
[00:05:38.850] But it's like there's no way because she aggressively just located my shoulder every time she went down through
[00:05:38.850] 但好像根本没有办法，因为她每次下来的时候都会不遗余力地瞄准我的肩膀。
[00:05:49.550] God I went through two nights without sleeping and when I got to Turks like I kid you not
[00:05:49.550] 天哪，我连续两晚没睡，到了特克斯群岛的时候，我跟你说，这可不是开玩笑。
[00:05:57.010] I had a sleep for like two days straight
[00:05:57.010] 我连续睡了两天。
[00:05:59.550] Oh my god
[00:05:59.550] 我的天啊
[00:06:00.170] Like legit I'd wake up eat lunch with the group go back to my room sleep until dinner time eat there
[00:06:00.170] 真的，我早上起来和大家一起吃午饭，然后回房间睡觉，一直睡到晚饭时间，在房间里吃晚饭。
[00:06:06.970] And then go back to sleep until like fucking you know seven eight eight eight and stuff
[00:06:06.970] 然后继续睡，直到你知道的，七八八八之类的。
[00:06:12.210] Yeah, so I can't handle all night or zamor
[00:06:12.210] 是的，所以我受不了整夜或扎莫尔
[00:06:15.250] But going back to your point G-soo
[00:06:15.250] 但回到你刚才说的，G-soo
[00:06:18.470] I also learned that if I exercise slash like workout in the morning
[00:06:18.470] 我还了解到，如果我早上进行锻炼/类似锻炼
[00:06:23.710] That it just significantly gives me a lot more energy throughout the day and stuff
[00:06:23.710] 它确实能显著提升我一整天的精力等等。
[00:06:28.770] And so that's why I started doing as well when I was there, you know
[00:06:28.770] 所以，这就是为什么我在那里的时候也开始这么做的原因，你知道的。
[00:06:31.530] When you say when we're in our late 20s you figure out like strategies instead which your body needs
[00:06:31.530] 你说到了快30岁的时候，你会开始琢磨一些策略，比如你的身体需要什么。
[00:06:36.890] Yeah definitely
[00:06:36.890] 是的，当然
[00:06:37.890] And sometimes even like really simple stuff to like drinking water all start to feel like shit at like one p.m.
[00:06:37.890] 有时候，就连喝水这样很简单的事情，到了下午一点左右也会感觉很糟糕。
[00:06:44.490] And then I realized I didn't choke water all day and I was like oh my god, I'm going to up my intake
[00:06:44.490] 然后我意识到我一整天都没呛到水，我就想，天哪，我得增加饮水量了。
[00:06:49.190] And like maintain all of this stuff like this is crazy
[00:06:49.190] 像这样维持所有这些东西简直太疯狂了。
[00:06:52.330] Yeah, I'm a little embarrassed to say but that's like a fucking recent revelation for me
[00:06:52.330] 是啊，说出来有点不好意思，但这对我来说简直是最近的新发现。
[00:06:57.610] You know like one p.m. 2 p.m. comes around and I'm like why am I so fucking tired
[00:06:57.610] 你知道，大概下午一点两点左右，我就会想，我为什么这么累？
[00:07:03.150] And I realized it's because I've only been drinking coffee
[00:07:03.150] 我意识到那是因为我只喝咖啡。
[00:07:06.430] You know that was my liquid intake
[00:07:06.430] 你知道那是我摄入的液体量。
[00:07:09.290] But then once I started drinking like hell of water
[00:07:09.290] 但后来我开始大量喝水。
[00:07:11.830] Yeah, I've been able to like not take it to our adapt during work
[00:07:11.830] 是的，我一直能够做到不在工作期间把它带到我们的适应环境中。
[00:07:17.290] Shit the ice
[00:07:17.290] 操冰
[00:07:19.370] I'm like looking I work from home
[00:07:19.370] 我看起来像是在看我在家工作。
[00:07:21.710] So I'm looking at my couch like off
[00:07:21.710] 于是我看着我的沙发，感觉有点不对劲。
[00:07:24.510] Dude yeah and coffee is dehydrating
[00:07:24.510] 兄弟，是啊，咖啡会使人脱水。
[00:07:26.950] I think we often forget that like caffeine is dehydrating in general
[00:07:26.950] 我觉得我们经常会忘记，咖啡因总体上会使人脱水。
[00:07:31.570] So it's like oh I'm awake for the next you know a couple hours and they're like okay now
[00:07:31.570] 所以就好像，哦，我接下来几个小时都醒着，然后他们就说，好吧，现在
[00:07:36.570] I'm like crashing and I'm like feeling weird
[00:07:36.570] 我感觉快要崩溃了，而且感觉很奇怪。
[00:07:39.510] And all I needed was some water
[00:07:39.510] 我需要的只是一些水。
[00:07:41.890] You feel like it's surprising you know when you don't know about it
[00:07:41.890] 当你对此一无所知时，你会觉得知道这件事很令人惊讶。
[00:07:45.650] But you know I drink my fucking triple espresso in the morning
[00:07:45.650] 但你知道我早上要喝三倍浓缩咖啡。
[00:07:48.270] I can't speak up don't drink any water
[00:07:48.270] 我无法说话，也别喝水。
[00:07:50.950] That I won't be able to win on tired
[00:07:50.950] 我不可能在疲惫的情况下获胜。
[00:07:52.610] I'm like what the fuck is going on?
[00:07:52.610] 我当时就想，这他妈到底是怎么回事？
[00:07:54.850] Usually like that
[00:07:54.850] 通常就是这样
[00:07:57.290] You're like trust me when I was 21
[00:07:57.290] 你就像在说“相信我”，那时我才21岁。
[00:07:59.110] I'd be powering through the day
[00:07:59.110] 我会努力熬过这一天。
[00:08:01.790] Yeah
[00:08:01.790] 是的
[00:08:02.330] Well yeah so a lot of things change and you realize that your body needs a lot of upkeep
[00:08:02.330] 是啊，很多事情都会改变，你会意识到你的身体需要很多保养。
[00:08:08.250] And you find strategies so like you know make it work and stuff
[00:08:08.250] 然后你找到一些策略，比如让事情运转起来之类的。
[00:08:11.810] I fucking stretch now
[00:08:11.810] 我现在正在伸展身体
[00:08:13.510] You know my god
[00:08:13.510] 你知道我的神
[00:08:14.810] I know right before you should make fun of people
[00:08:14.810] 我知道在你嘲笑别人之前，应该先嘲笑他们。
[00:08:17.430] Are you saying for my housemates
[00:08:17.430] 你是说给我的室友们吗？
[00:08:19.630] This is so my previous housemates were like I think seven years older than me
[00:08:19.630] 我之前的室友好像比我大七岁左右。
[00:08:24.310] So when I was 25 they're like 32 and stuff
[00:08:24.310] 所以当我25岁的时候，他们都32岁了。
[00:08:27.350] And they stretched before like this is my activity and everything
[00:08:27.350] 他们之前伸展身体，就像这是我的活动和一切一样。
[00:08:30.070] I'm like fucking old ass people
[00:08:30.070] 我就像一群老古董
[00:08:33.690] I need to do it just take it you know
[00:08:33.690] 我必须这么做，你就拿去吧，你知道的。
[00:08:37.390] Now it's like you're hearing stories about your friends
[00:08:37.390] 现在感觉就像在听朋友们的故事一样
[00:08:41.490] Where they're hearing their Achilles and stuff
[00:08:41.490] 他们在哪里听到他们的阿喀琉斯之类的东西
[00:08:44.150] Right true
[00:08:44.150] 没错
[00:08:45.330] My friend Mikey
[00:08:45.330] 我的朋友迈克
[00:08:46.690] It was so sad we were playing a pickleball like a public park
[00:08:46.690] 我们像在公共公园一样打匹克球，真是太令人难过了。
[00:08:50.970] And then because it's so popular you got to wait like 30 minutes until you get into a game
[00:08:50.970] 然后因为游戏太火爆，你得等上30分钟才能开始玩。
[00:08:55.590] 30 minutes and he didn't stretch at all
[00:08:55.590] 30分钟过去了，他一点儿也没拉伸。

[00:09:17.090] 我知道我现在感觉生活中的很多事情都像是在做准备工作。
[00:09:21.010] Honestly to me it boils down to like impulse control almost because if I had to describe it
[00:09:21.010] 说实话，对我来说，这几乎可以归结为冲动控制的问题，因为如果要我描述的话……

[00:09:27.410] 我想在我二十出头的时候
[00:09:29.130] I live my life exactly how I wanted to

[00:09:37.270] 比如我想锻炼，或者我想做这件事
[00:09:39.630] But now it's not because I want to do it
[00:09:39.630] 但现在并不是因为我想这么做。
[00:09:41.810] It's like I need it
[00:09:41.810] 我好像需要它
[00:09:42.790] Like I know I need to exercise

[00:10:50.590] 因为我知道我正在变胖。
[00:10:53.450] When I could start seeing my cheeks in my peripherals
[00:10:53.450] 当我开始能用余光看到自己的脸颊时

[00:11:05.930] Oh I can see my cheeks
[00:11:05.930] 哦，我能看到我的脸颊了。

[00:11:11.950] 就像照片里的那样，伙计，就像我朋友那样
[00:11:14.890] Take pictures from me from the side profile
[00:11:14.890] 请从侧面拍摄我的照片
[00:11:16.990] And I got a protruding head down here
[00:11:16.990] 我这儿有个凸出来的脑袋。
[00:11:21.570] There were signs
[00:11:21.570] 有迹象表明
[00:11:23.210] Yeah
[00:11:23.210] 是的
[00:11:24.090] You know okay anger on my friends
[00:11:24.090] 你知道，好吧，我对我的朋友们很生气
[00:11:25.970] Like how can you guys do tell me this stuff
[00:11:25.970] 你们怎么能告诉我这些事呢？
[00:11:29.850] Oh my god speaking of though
[00:11:29.850] 我的天啊，说到这个……
[00:11:31.730] I realized I was like because some days I work from home
[00:11:31.730] 我意识到我之所以这样，是因为有些日子我在家工作。
[00:11:35.230] And so some of these days
[00:11:35.230] 所以，在某些日子里
[00:11:36.730] I'm just like not getting steps in
[00:11:36.730] 我感觉自己步数不够。
[00:11:38.450] I'm like not really moving
[00:11:38.450] 我感觉自己好像没怎么动。
[00:11:39.730] So I literally bought a walking pad to use
[00:11:39.730] 所以我真的买了一块步行垫来用
[00:11:42.910] To make sure that on those like sedentary days
[00:11:42.910] 为了确保在那些久坐不动的日子里也能如此。
[00:11:46.070] I can hop on the walking pad
[00:11:46.070] 我可以跳上步行垫。
[00:11:47.910] And get hopefully around 10,000 steps in
[00:11:47.910] 希望能够走够10000步左右
[00:11:51.370] What's a walking pad
[00:11:51.370] 什么是步行垫
[00:11:52.570] It's a mini treadmill
[00:11:52.570] 这是一台迷你跑步机
[00:11:54.370] That only goes up to about three miles per hour and speed
[00:11:54.370] 那速度最高也就只有大约三英里/小时。
[00:11:58.330] And there's no like handle bar you hold onto
[00:11:58.330] 而且没有像车把那样可以让你握住的东西。
[00:12:00.610] So you can just kind of like tuck it under your couch
[00:12:00.610] 所以你可以把它塞到沙发底下。
[00:12:03.670] And like pull it out to like walk on it
[00:12:03.670] 然后就像把它拉出来，踩在上面一样。
[00:12:05.950] Why don't you just go outside
[00:12:05.950] 你为什么不出去走走呢？
[00:12:07.150] Dude
[00:12:07.150] 哥们
[00:12:09.070] It's an efficient use of time
[00:12:09.070] 这是有效利用时间的方式。
[00:12:11.150] Because I can just if I'm doing things like watching TV
[00:12:11.150] 因为我只要做些事情，比如看电视，就能做到这一点。
[00:12:15.030] Or like working I could use it
[00:12:15.030] 或者像工作一样，我可以利用它
[00:12:18.410] I understand now
[00:12:18.410] 我现在明白了
[00:12:21.150] I thought you're just like freaking
[00:12:21.150] 我以为你简直疯了
[00:12:24.070] Correntining at oh no
[00:12:24.070] 哦不
[00:12:25.630] Don't want to leave at all
[00:12:25.630] 一点也不想离开
[00:12:27.590] There's no way I would just walk and stare at a wall
[00:12:27.590] 我绝不会就这么走来走去，盯着墙看。
[00:12:31.990] You're a crystal I thought it was facing like a corner of the wall
[00:12:31.990] 你是一块水晶，我原以为它像墙角一样朝向我。
[00:12:36.230] Do you know about your whole dark industry?
[00:12:36.230] 你了解你所在的整个黑暗产业吗？
[00:12:40.010] No, I just walk on it when I watch TV
[00:12:40.010] 不，我看电视的时候就在上面走走。
[00:12:42.450] Which is super good because I can easily walk for like two three hours
[00:12:42.450] 这太好了，因为我可以轻松地走两三个小时。
[00:12:46.430] If you watch like put on a movie and that's like 10 to 15k
[00:12:46.430] 如果你看电视，比如放部电影，那大概要花1万到1.5万美元。
[00:12:50.370] You've done that?
[00:12:50.370] 你做过这件事？
[00:12:51.690] You've walked throughout an entire movie?
[00:12:51.690] 你竟然在整部电影里都走来走去？
[00:12:53.990] Yeah, yeah
[00:12:53.990] 是啊是啊
[00:12:54.730] That's pretty crazy
[00:12:54.730] 这太疯狂了
[00:12:55.310] That's impressive
[00:12:55.310] 那真是令人印象深刻
[00:12:56.110] I don't know if I could do that
[00:12:56.110] 我不知道我能不能做到。
[00:12:57.990] My crystal is stocks just went way
[00:12:57.990] 我的水晶股票已经卖光了
[00:13:00.730] Thank you, thank you
[00:13:00.730] 谢谢，谢谢。
[00:13:03.290] You converted a hater
[00:13:03.290] 你让一个黑粉改变了看法
[00:13:05.930] But I guess aside from lifestyle changes right
[00:13:05.930] 但我想除了生活方式的改变之外，对吧？
[00:13:09.430] I feel like that kind of stuff is almost
[00:13:09.430] 我觉得那种事几乎
[00:13:11.250] Small decisions that you make on the daily
[00:13:11.250] 你每天做出的小决定
[00:13:13.710] But I think there are also probably some bigger like key decisions that we have made over the last few years
[00:13:13.710] 但我认为，过去几年里，我们可能也做出了一些更重要、更关键的决定。
[00:13:19.690] To really inspire the changes or push ourselves forward as we age
[00:13:19.690] 随着年龄增长，真正激发改变或推动我们前进的动力。
[00:13:24.230] So can you think of any like major conscious decisions that you made?
[00:13:24.230] 那么，你能想到一些你曾经做出过的重大而有意识的决定吗？
[00:13:28.450] I think honestly it's like a mix of the two key conscious decisions things that jump into mind
[00:13:28.450] 我觉得这其实是两种关键的、有意识的决定结合起来的结果，这些决定会立刻浮现在我的脑海中。
[00:13:34.830] You know, I have a lot of uh
[00:13:34.830] 你知道，我有很多呃
[00:13:36.830] Vices. I'll just leave it at that
[00:13:36.830] 恶习。我就说到这儿吧。
[00:13:38.850] I got a lot of vices that I've had to consciously be aware of sometimes is called Turkey
[00:13:38.850] 我有很多恶习，有时我必须有意识地去注意，这叫做土耳其
[00:13:45.850] I think the uh safer work
[00:13:45.850] 我认为更安全的工作
[00:13:48.890] Example would be like honesty girls. I just re-addicted two girls
[00:13:48.890] 举个例子，就像那些诚实的女孩一样。我刚刚又让两个女孩上瘾了。
[00:13:53.050] I guess
[00:13:53.050] 我猜
[00:13:54.450] I guess
[00:13:54.450] 我猜
[00:13:56.210] Shout out Eddie now
[00:13:56.210] 现在就向埃迪喊话
[00:14:00.850] Before when I was like
[00:14:00.850] 以前我就像
[00:14:03.390] 25 where guess my entire life up until 25
[00:14:03.390] 25岁，猜猜我25岁之前的整个人生都在哪里
[00:14:07.230] The 25 was like the key pivotal time when I was like on-hinge
[00:14:07.230] 25岁那年就像一个关键的转折点，我当时就像在铰链上一样。
[00:14:11.330] And I would be you know, dang girls constantly always looking for the next one
[00:14:11.330] 而我，你知道，那些女孩总是不断地寻找下一个目标。
[00:14:16.570] But then that's something that you know, I had to make a conscious decision about that
[00:14:16.570] 但你知道，这是我必须认真考虑后做出的决定。
[00:14:21.130] Okay, this is honestly pretty negative right?
[00:14:21.130] 好吧，这确实挺消极的，对吧？
[00:14:24.290] You start from empty inside. You start feeling very just like what am I doing in my life
[00:14:24.290] 你一开始内心一片空白。你会开始感到非常迷茫，不知道自己的人生究竟在做什么。
[00:14:28.950] Like this is now like my life purpose
[00:14:28.950] 这就像我现在的人生目标一样。
[00:14:31.510] At the same time too, it was meant right?
[00:14:31.510] 与此同时，这也是意料之中的事，对吧？
[00:14:35.290] And that was incredibly fun as a job
[00:14:35.290] 那份工作真的非常有趣。
[00:14:38.550] But then just like with the girl thing I start feeling a little empty inside
[00:14:38.550] 但就像对女孩子那样，我又开始感到内心有些空虚。
[00:14:43.170] Because you're so sort of like selling your soul right you're selling your personality for money
[00:14:43.170] 因为你这不就相当于出卖灵魂吗？你为了钱出卖了自己的个性。
[00:14:47.490] As I say anything where girls two where you're starting to just like make adaptations to your personality
[00:14:47.490] 正如我所说，任何关于女孩的事情，当你开始对自己的个性做出调整时，你都会感到很困扰。
[00:14:52.930] You're mooring it in a way where you know, it'll fit different types of personalities
[00:14:52.930] 你把它固定住的方式，你知道，会适合不同性格的人。
[00:14:59.410] It'll fit different types of people
[00:14:59.410] 它适合不同类型的人
[00:15:02.150] And so that was the key decision I made around like okay I quit my job as a salesman
[00:15:02.150] 所以，我做出的关键决定就是辞掉了销售员的工作。
[00:15:08.170] And then I I deleted it and it was really good for me in the long run
[00:15:08.170] 然后我就把它删了，从长远来看，这对我很有好处。
[00:15:12.910] Because then it was more you know, I'm doing stuff for myself
[00:15:12.910] 因为那时候更多的是，你知道，我做事是为了自己。
[00:15:16.210] And I'm staying true to my personality
[00:15:16.210] 我会始终保持我的个性。
[00:15:17.870] And I'm not changing it
[00:15:17.870] 我不会改变它
[00:15:19.990] Like you got to grow into your own personality more
[00:15:19.990] 就像你需要慢慢培养出自己的个性一样。
[00:15:24.510] Mm-hmm, exactly exactly
[00:15:24.510] 嗯，正是如此。
[00:15:26.530] And so I think that was those of really big key conscious decision I made
[00:15:26.530] 所以我觉得，那些是我做出的真正重大而关键的自觉决定。
[00:15:31.390] I guess the biggest one was last December
[00:15:31.390] 我想最大的一次是去年十二月
[00:15:34.630] I adopted a dog
[00:15:34.630] 我收养了一只狗
[00:15:36.930] Rhyla you guys don't wrap it
[00:15:36.930] Rhyla，你们不把它包起来。
[00:15:39.350] A little puppy
[00:15:39.350] 一只小狗
[00:15:40.190] She's my everything now
[00:15:40.190] 她现在是我的一切。
[00:15:41.970] But yeah, that was a big decision I made
[00:15:41.970] 是的，那是我做出的一个重大决定。
[00:15:45.470] I did most of the because I grew up with dogs and so I just missed having a dog around
[00:15:45.470] 我做了很多，因为我从小就和狗一起长大，所以我很想念有狗陪伴的日子。
[00:15:50.010] But once I got her it made me
[00:15:50.010] 但自从我得到她之后，我就……
[00:15:53.330] I don't know, it just sold me down like immediately
[00:15:53.330] 我不知道，反正它一下子就把我拉黑了。
[00:15:56.190] Well you guys know this I'm a I'm a party person
[00:15:56.190] 你们都知道，我是一个爱玩爱闹的人。
[00:15:59.890] I'm like going to parties. I used to like every weekend
[00:15:59.890] 我喜欢去参加派对。我以前喜欢每个周末。
[00:16:02.590] I would have something Friday afternoon
[00:16:02.590] 我周五下午会安排点什么。
[00:16:05.130] And then someone's birthday Friday night
[00:16:05.130] 然后周五晚上是某人的生日
[00:16:08.210] And then Saturday you know, I do like a morning hike with someone
[00:16:08.210] 然后星期六，你知道，我喜欢早上和别人一起徒步旅行。
[00:16:11.910] And then I would go and you know go to a day party
[00:16:11.910] 然后我就会去参加白天的派对。
[00:16:15.470] Someone's birthday. So many birthdays in the year
[00:16:15.470] 某人的生日。一年里有好多生日。
[00:16:17.910] Go to a day party and then go to a night party
[00:16:17.910] 先去参加日间派对，然后再去参加夜间派对。
[00:16:20.830] And then go to a afters afterwards
[00:16:20.830] 然后去参加后续活动。
[00:16:22.570] Get home like fucking for a yeah
[00:16:22.570] 回家就像他妈的一样，是啊
[00:16:24.590] And then just like repeat and rinse right, rinse and repeat
[00:16:24.590] 然后就像重复冲洗一样，冲洗并重复
[00:16:29.030] Now I have the dog, I don't do that anymore
[00:16:29.030] 现在我有了狗，我就不再做那种事了。
[00:16:31.770] And so now I'm way more conscious of who I hang out with
[00:16:31.770] 所以现在我更加注意和谁交往了。
[00:16:35.130] And how I spend my time
[00:16:35.130] 以及我如何度过我的时间
[00:16:36.530] I'll go to like two birthdays every weekend
[00:16:36.530] 我每个周末大概会去参加两个生日聚会。
[00:16:40.090] Even though that's still a lot but it's not a lot
[00:16:40.090] 虽然这仍然很多，但也不是很多。
[00:16:43.450] It's still a lot but it's not like I'm there from like 6 p.m.
[00:16:43.450] 虽然工作量仍然很大，但我又不像晚上6点那样一直待在那里。
[00:16:48.850] 6 a.m. you know, I'm not hearing the birds chirping anymore
[00:16:48.850] 早上六点，你知道吗，我再也听不到鸟儿的鸣叫声了。
[00:16:51.650] I'm not hearing morning joggers
[00:16:51.650] 我没听到晨跑者的声音。
[00:16:53.910] It's still dark when you get home
[00:16:53.910] 到家时天还黑着。
[00:16:55.890] Yeah, it's still dark when I get home
[00:16:55.890] 是啊，我到家的时候天还没亮。
[00:16:59.010] And it's still very much like okay if I if I get home
[00:16:59.010] 而且感觉还是挺好的，如果我能回家的话。
[00:17:03.070] Out like two a.m. then I'll be able to get some sleep wake up at
[00:17:03.070] 凌晨两点左右出门，然后就能睡一会儿，早上醒来。
[00:17:07.950] It a.m. just so I can walk right take her out
[00:17:07.950] 早上，这样我就可以走着带她出去了。
[00:17:11.890] Feed her even though she refuses either food now
[00:17:11.890] 即使她现在拒绝任何食物，也要喂她。
[00:17:15.330] Feed her and just makes her she's all right
[00:17:15.330] 喂饱她，让她开心起来，她就没事了。
[00:17:18.150] So I think just having that extra responsibility of having a dog
[00:17:18.150] 所以我觉得，养狗这份额外的责任本身就是一种负担。
[00:17:21.790] It's really it's really changed me because it's just like so
[00:17:21.790] 它真的改变了我，因为它就是这样。
[00:17:25.710] It made me down a lot more and it's made me
[00:17:25.710] 这让我更加沮丧，也让我……
[00:17:29.250] I don't know I grew up the youngest kid in my family
[00:17:29.250] 我不知道，我从小就是家里最小的孩子。
[00:17:32.570] So I was very much just the child you know my entire life
[00:17:32.570] 所以，我整个人生基本上就是个孩子。
[00:17:36.030] I was I was a youngest not only sibling but youngest cousin
[00:17:36.030] 我不仅是家中最小的兄弟姐妹，也是最小的堂兄弟姐妹。
[00:17:39.750] My entire family you know so I was just the baby of the family
[00:17:39.750] 你知道，我全家都是这样，所以我是家里最小的孩子。
[00:17:42.670] I never had to like take care of anyone
[00:17:42.670] 我从来不需要照顾任何人。
[00:17:44.670] I very high take care of myself
[00:17:44.670] 我非常注重自我照顾。
[00:17:46.570] Take care of me
[00:17:46.570] 照顾我
[00:17:48.350] So I got a dog like complete like flip the script
[00:17:48.350] 所以我养了一条狗，就像彻底颠覆剧本一样。
[00:17:51.590] We're now I'm taking care of another moving thing
[00:17:51.590] 我现在正在处理另一件搬家的事情。
[00:17:54.390] And so now I'm not thinking too much of myself anymore
[00:17:54.390] 所以现在我不再那么在意自己了。
[00:17:57.710] You know I'm thinking more of like her well being and that's like paramount to me
[00:17:57.710] 你知道，我更关心的是她的安危，这对我来说才是最重要的。
[00:18:02.710] And luckily it also helps you
[00:18:02.710] 幸运的是，它对你也有帮助。
[00:18:05.710] Yeah, yeah, like it's really built healthy habits
[00:18:05.710] 是啊，是啊，它确实帮助人们养成了健康的生活习惯。
[00:18:09.050] I mean you guys would probably me right
[00:18:09.050] 我的意思是，你们大概会同意我的说法吧？
[00:18:10.770] Like I went to my friends B-day yesterday
[00:18:10.770] 就像我昨天去参加朋友的生日派对一样
[00:18:14.010] And I came home at 12 a.m.
[00:18:14.010] 我凌晨12点才到家。
[00:18:15.710] Dude impressive
[00:18:15.710] 老兄，真厉害。
[00:18:17.170] So that's a lot
[00:18:17.170] 所以，这很多。
[00:18:21.030] It's pretty good. It's pretty good
[00:18:21.030] 还不错。还不错。
[00:18:22.730] So yeah, no it's just maybe more responsible
[00:18:22.730] 所以，是的，不，这或许只是更负责任的做法。
[00:18:25.930] And I guess a better functioning citizen of society
[00:18:25.930] 我想，一个能更好地履行社会责任的公民会成为社会中更优秀的公民。
[00:18:30.010] You're like damn if I don't go home for myself
[00:18:30.010] 你心里想的是，如果我不回家，我就要回家。
[00:18:33.110] Rhyla is waiting for me at home
[00:18:33.110] 莱拉在家等我呢
[00:18:35.230] Like I need to go home for her
[00:18:35.230] 好像我需要回家陪她似的。
[00:18:37.310] True
[00:18:37.310] 真的
[00:18:37.650] Oh yeah, well it's not just that too
[00:18:37.650] 哦，是啊，也不全是这个原因。
[00:18:39.370] It's like I'm excited to go home you know
[00:18:39.370] 你知道吗，我感觉自己好像很兴奋要回家。
[00:18:41.990] Walk to the door
[00:18:41.990] 走到门口
[00:18:42.950] She wakes up like
[00:18:42.950] 她醒来时就像
[00:18:45.570] And like
[00:18:45.570] 就像
[00:18:46.610] Baby
[00:18:46.610] 婴儿
[00:18:49.310] And then if I'm still drunk I'll lay it down on the floor
[00:18:49.310] 如果我还醉着，我就把它放在地板上。
[00:18:52.410] And just have her like run all over me
[00:18:52.410] 然后让她像个疯子一样在我身上乱窜
[00:18:54.330] And that's the thing ever
[00:18:54.330] 这就是一直以来发生的事情。
[00:18:56.430] I feel like this is what makes me very excited to have kids
[00:18:56.430] 我觉得这就是我非常渴望拥有孩子的原因。
[00:19:00.450] Because the responsibility of having someone to take care of is huge
[00:19:00.450] 因为照顾他人的责任非常重大。
[00:19:05.710] And I feel like I'm someone who
[00:19:05.710] 我觉得自己是那种
[00:19:08.110] Enjoys kind of having that responsibility sometimes
[00:19:08.110] 有时他很享受承担这种责任的感觉。
[00:19:10.410] Or maybe also much enjoy
[00:19:10.410] 或许也很喜欢
[00:19:12.070] But I think I could be like a bigger person
[00:19:12.070] 但我认为我可以变得更宽容一些。
[00:19:15.670] If I had something to take care of
[00:19:15.670] 如果我有什么事要处理
[00:19:17.510] Like it would bring out more from within me
[00:19:17.510] 感觉它会激发我内心更多潜能。
[00:19:20.490] So I'm just like super excited to have kids
[00:19:20.490] 所以，我超级期待有孩子。
[00:19:23.650] And you know things like that are big
[00:19:23.650] 你知道，这类事情意义重大。
[00:19:25.310] Conscious decisions right?
[00:19:25.310] 这是有意识的决定，对吧？
[00:19:26.650] Like you said Crystal, usually beneficial for both you and
[00:19:26.650] 正如你所说，Crystal，这通常对你和对方都有好处。
[00:19:30.110] Whatever you're taking care of
[00:19:30.110] 无论你在处理什么
[00:19:33.670] Hopefully
[00:19:33.670] 希望如此
[00:19:35.110] Right
[00:19:35.110] 正确的
[00:19:36.370] Maybe it's a longer term thing for kids
[00:19:36.370] 也许这对孩子们来说是一个更长远的问题。
[00:19:40.270] That's true
[00:19:40.270] 这是真的
[00:19:41.350] Well I think so too because it's just like
[00:19:41.350] 我也这么认为，因为它就像……
[00:19:43.550] I think especially dogs and kids
[00:19:43.550] 我觉得尤其是狗和孩子
[00:19:45.790] They were flexion of you
[00:19:45.790] 他们是你的屈膝礼
[00:19:47.510] So if you're doggy shitty
[00:19:47.510] 所以如果你是狗屎
[00:19:49.750] Like there'll be you know shitty dogs at the dog park
[00:19:49.750] 就像你知道的，狗公园里总会有一些很讨厌的狗一样。
[00:19:52.830] You'll be like that owner doesn't have their shit together
[00:19:52.830] 你会觉得那个老板简直一团糟。
[00:19:56.690] You know like their owner isn't really doing as much as they can
[00:19:56.690] 你知道，就像他们的主人并没有尽其所能一样。
[00:20:01.650] Like my friend right now is trying to adopt a puppy
[00:20:01.650] 比如我朋友现在就想领养一只小狗。
[00:20:04.110] And then and so she's like spent time with just like getting to know it
[00:20:04.110] 然后，她就花时间去了解它。
[00:20:08.290] And then she texted both me and my friend who I'm dogs
[00:20:08.290] 然后她给我和我的朋友都发了短信，我们都是狗。
[00:20:10.570] And she's like honestly I realize you guys are actually like
[00:20:10.570] 她就说，老实说，我意识到你们其实是这样的
[00:20:13.610] Great parents
[00:20:13.610] 伟大的父母
[00:20:14.870] Your dogs are so well behaved
[00:20:14.870] 你的狗狗们真乖。
[00:20:17.690] They're not like bark and everything
[00:20:17.690] 它们不像树皮之类的东西
[00:20:19.410] They're not growling on anything
[00:20:19.410] 它们并没有因为任何事而低吼。
[00:20:21.070] And it's just like a total reflection
[00:20:21.070] 这就像是一场彻底的反射。
[00:20:22.950] And you you feel proud
[00:20:22.950] 你感到自豪
[00:20:24.910] Yeah, I feel more proud when people compliment
[00:20:24.910] 是的，别人夸奖我的时候会更自豪。
[00:20:27.330] Rather than I do if people compliment me
[00:20:27.330] 如果有人称赞我，我反而会……
[00:20:30.110] Oh
[00:20:30.110] 哦
[00:20:31.510] That's so cute
[00:20:31.510] 太可爱了
[00:20:32.970] Yeah, I feel like you're right
[00:20:32.970] 是啊，我觉得你说得对。
[00:20:34.350] It's definitely a good exercise
[00:20:34.350] 这绝对是一项不错的锻炼
[00:20:36.560] You're truly learning to take care of something else
[00:20:36.560] 你真的在学习如何照顾其他事情。
[00:20:39.270] Especially if you get a dog when they're like a puppy
[00:20:39.270] 尤其是如果你在狗狗还是幼犬的时候就养了它。
[00:20:42.510] So you're like the biggest influence on their life
[00:20:42.510] 所以你对他们的生活影响最大
[00:20:45.950] Yeah, yeah exactly
[00:20:45.950] 对，没错
[00:20:47.510] I think it's really much just like you have to sacrifice a lot
[00:20:47.510] 我觉得这真的就像你必须做出很多牺牲一样。
[00:20:51.750] You've sacrificed a lot of not just your time
[00:20:51.750] 你牺牲了很多，不仅仅是时间。
[00:20:54.450] But your own self
[00:20:54.450] 但你自己
[00:20:56.710] It's like an exchange where you're sacrificing
[00:20:56.710] 这就像一场交换，你在做出牺牲。
[00:20:59.050] You know what made you happy as an individual
[00:20:59.050] 你知道作为个体，什么会让你感到快乐。
[00:21:02.450] And now you know the thing you're taking care of
[00:21:02.450] 现在你知道你要照顾的是什么了。
[00:21:06.530] is honestly a main source of your happiness
[00:21:06.530] 的确是你幸福的主要来源。
[00:21:09.490] Yeah
[00:21:09.490] 是的
[00:21:09.970] And you're fine with it
[00:21:09.970] 你对此并不介意。
[00:21:11.370] It's not like doom and gloom
[00:21:11.370] 这并非一片悲观绝望。
[00:21:12.830] It's like you like it that way
[00:21:12.830] 看来你喜欢这样。
[00:21:15.190] Right
[00:21:15.190] 正确的
[00:21:15.750] Yeah, and I feel like it just like expands your world view
[00:21:15.750] 是的，我觉得它能拓展你的世界观。
[00:21:19.510] Almost because it's kind of like
[00:21:19.510] 几乎是因为它有点像
[00:21:21.410] You know when you don't have guests over
[00:21:21.410] 你知道那种家里没有客人的时候。
[00:21:23.510] It's okay if your house is a little messy
[00:21:23.510] 家里有点乱也没关系。
[00:21:25.270] But then when you know people are coming over
[00:21:25.270] 但当你意识到有人要过来的时候，情况就不同了。
[00:21:27.870] You like clean the house
[00:21:27.870] 你喜欢打扫房子
[00:21:29.030] Because you're okay with like a little bit of mess
[00:21:29.030] 因为你并不介意有点混乱。
[00:21:30.970] But you don't want guests having to deal with that or whatever
[00:21:30.970] 但你肯定不希望客人处理这些事之类的。
[00:21:33.910] I feel like it's almost the same thing too
[00:21:33.910] 我觉得这几乎是一回事。
[00:21:36.010] It's like I can be satisfied with my own life
[00:21:36.010] 感觉我可以对自己的生活感到满足。
[00:21:38.770] Out like a certain bar
[00:21:38.770] 像某个酒吧一样出去
[00:21:40.090] But for my kids life
[00:21:40.090] 但为了我的孩子们的生命
[00:21:41.470] Like I want them to have so much more
[00:21:41.470] 我希望他们拥有更多。
[00:21:43.610] And like so much access to stuff
[00:21:43.610] 而且就像很多东西一样，很容易就能接触到。
[00:21:45.230] So then at a certain point
[00:21:45.230] 所以，在某个时候……
[00:21:46.790] It's just like they're able to expand your world
[00:21:46.790] 就好像他们能够拓展你的世界一样。
[00:21:50.130] As much as you are working to like expand theirs
[00:21:50.130] 尽管你努力想扩大他们的
[00:21:53.190] It's basically just upkeep right
[00:21:53.190] 基本上就是日常维护保养，对吧？
[00:21:55.310] Before Rala
[00:21:55.310] 拉拉之前
[00:21:56.590] I didn't go for walks
[00:21:56.590] 我没去散步。
[00:21:58.630] You know
[00:21:58.630] 你知道
[00:21:59.170] I'm not a problem patty there
[00:21:59.170] 我不是个麻烦，帕蒂。
[00:22:00.810] Did you need a walking fan?
[00:22:00.810] 你需要一台便携式风扇吗？
[00:22:04.390] I should probably just leash Rala onto the walk guide
[00:22:04.390] 我或许应该把拉拉拴在导游身上。
[00:22:08.090] That's not sufficient
[00:22:08.090] 这还不够。
[00:22:10.050] But yeah
[00:22:10.050] 是的
[00:22:10.770] It's very much like forces you to just do stuff
[00:22:10.770] 它很像强迫你去做事。
[00:22:14.730] That are honestly inherently healthy
[00:22:14.730] 那些本质上健康的
[00:22:16.670] But you don't really do it because it's just you
[00:22:16.670] 但你其实并没有这么做，因为只有你一个人。
[00:22:18.810] You have a lower standard for yourself
[00:22:18.810] 你对自己的要求比较低。
[00:22:21.210] They do for someone that's dependent on you
[00:22:21.210] 他们会为那些依赖你的人这样做。
[00:22:23.790] So now I tear on our long walks
[00:22:23.790] 所以现在我会在我们漫长的散步中哭泣
[00:22:26.590] I tear it to the dog park
[00:22:26.590] 我把它撕碎，带到狗公园。
[00:22:28.090] Because I want to just start being social with dogs and stuff
[00:22:28.090] 因为我只是想开始和狗狗们进行社交活动之类的。
[00:22:31.190] It's cute too because I've taken Rala to the dog park every day
[00:22:31.190] 这也挺可爱的，因为我每天都带拉拉去狗公园。
[00:22:35.910] The regular is there
[00:22:35.910] 常客在那里
[00:22:37.150] They always come up to me and they're like
[00:22:37.150] 他们总是走过来跟我说：
[00:22:39.070] Oh I see the progress that Rala is making
[00:22:39.070] 哦，我看到了拉拉取得的进步。
[00:22:41.270] She's game more social you know
[00:22:41.270] 她更喜欢社交，你知道的。
[00:22:43.490] She's not to intimidate anymore
[00:22:43.490] 她不再具有威慑力了。
[00:22:46.670] But big dogs and stuff
[00:22:46.670] 但是大型犬之类的
[00:22:48.690] And so it's and you hear that you're like
[00:22:48.690] 所以就是这样，你听到你说你就像
[00:22:50.490] You know right so you're doing good job
[00:22:50.490] 你知道的，所以你做得很好。
[00:22:53.690] She's she's growing as a dog too
[00:22:53.690] 她也在长大，像只狗一样。
[00:22:56.990] And her personality started shining out
[00:22:56.990] 她的个性开始闪耀起来
[00:22:59.650] Yeah you used to become more proud
[00:22:59.650] 是的，你以前会变得更加骄傲
[00:23:01.650] Oh my god she made such a happy dad
[00:23:01.650] 我的天哪，她让爸爸太开心了！
[00:23:04.590] I know I'm not a dog dad
[00:23:04.590] 我知道我不是个称职的狗爸。
[00:23:07.110] Yeah right now she's in killing my bed
[00:23:07.110] 是啊，她现在正在我的床上杀人。
[00:23:10.230] Living life
[00:23:10.230] 生活
[00:23:11.930] She barked it was like the first time I were two because it's all creator at night
[00:23:11.930] 她吠叫着，就像我第一次两岁时那样，因为一切都是夜晚的造物主。
[00:23:17.030] And she likes it like that you know
[00:23:17.030] 她就喜欢这样，你知道的。
[00:23:18.430] She likes like her own little personal space
[00:23:18.430] 她喜欢拥有自己的小私人空间。
[00:23:20.510] So then I creator at night but then this morning
[00:23:20.510] 所以，我晚上创作了这部剧，但今天早上……
[00:23:23.550] Yes she heard me and my friend in my bedroom
[00:23:23.550] 是的，她听到了我和我朋友在我卧室里的声音。
[00:23:26.150] Then she she started barking
[00:23:26.150] 然后她开始吠叫
[00:23:27.850] I was like oh she never really barks you know
[00:23:27.850] 我当时就想，哦，她从来不怎么叫，你知道吗？
[00:23:30.530] I thought she needs like go pee go poop
[00:23:30.530] 我以为她需要去小便或大便。
[00:23:32.830] She don't want to go pee and poop
[00:23:32.830] 她不想去小便和大便
[00:23:33.910] She just ran straight to my bed like
[00:23:33.910] 她径直跑到我的床上，就像……
[00:23:36.310] Let me yeah let me yeah
[00:23:36.310] 让我，让我，耶
[00:23:37.690] She's jealous
[00:23:37.690] 她嫉妒了。
[00:23:39.070] Yeah that's the right act
[00:23:39.070] 是的，这才是正确的做法。
[00:23:41.990] She's just chilling there and like god dad
[00:23:41.990] 她就在那儿悠闲地待着，就像教父一样
[00:23:44.610] Like I peaked over
[00:23:44.610] 就像我窥见了真相一样
[00:23:46.110] She's like down in her back
[00:23:46.110] 她背部好像很低。
[00:23:48.370] She's like living life
[00:23:48.370] 她就像在生活。
[00:23:51.390] I do have a question though
[00:23:51.390] 不过我确实有个问题。
[00:23:52.950] Because now that you have you know more responsibility
[00:23:52.950] 因为现在你明白自己肩负着更大的责任。
[00:23:55.850] Taking care of Rila
[00:23:55.850] 照顾里拉
[00:23:57.690] And you've cut down a lot on your social activity
[00:23:57.690] 你的社交活动也大幅减少了。
[00:24:02.070] How do you be more picky and cheesy with these hangouts
[00:24:02.070] 如何才能在这些聚会中变得更加挑剔和俗气
[00:24:05.570] Like what helps you determine you know which event you should be going
[00:24:05.570] 比如，什么能帮助你确定自己应该参加哪个活动？
[00:24:10.070] To and which one you can probably forget about
[00:24:10.070] 以及你可能可以忘记的那一个
[00:24:13.850] You know I don't know this is like two aggressive
[00:24:13.850] 你知道，我不知道，这就像太咄咄逼人了。
[00:24:16.970] But you start having sort of like boundaries that you have
[00:24:16.970] 但你开始会建立起某种界限。
[00:24:24.890] Where it's like a you know black and white things like for instance
[00:24:24.890] 就像黑白分明的事情一样，例如
[00:24:28.450] I moved into my new place here right
[00:24:28.450] 我搬进了我的新家，对吧？
[00:24:30.970] And I've been here for like a year maybe two years
[00:24:30.970] 我在这里待了大概一年，也许两年了。
[00:24:34.270] The friends that haven't made an effort to visit me
[00:24:34.270] 那些没有特意来看望我的朋友们
[00:24:38.670] I know a longer really like care to try and go with them and stuff
[00:24:38.670] 我知道我不再真的想费心去尝试和他们一起走之类的。
[00:24:43.270] And everything you know and so it sort of makes it easy like that
[00:24:43.270] 你所知道的一切，都让事情变得很容易。
[00:24:47.470] Like the friends that flake they give like a larger penalty now
[00:24:47.470] 就像那些放鸽子的朋友，现在他们要加大惩罚力度一样。
[00:24:50.870] You know and because I write a you know
[00:24:50.870] 你知道，因为我写了一篇你知道的文章。
[00:24:53.870] I can't I can't drive to SF all the time
[00:24:53.870] 我不能，我不能一直开车去旧金山。
[00:24:56.290] I can't do that so now I'm expecting you know my friends and SF
[00:24:56.290] 我做不到，所以我现在期待着我的朋友们和旧金山。
[00:25:00.290] To make the drive down here
[00:25:00.290] 开车来这里
[00:25:02.010] You know you be surprised
[00:25:02.010] 你知道你会感到惊讶
[00:25:03.710] And they do the trimming for you where the majority of them
[00:25:03.710] 而且他们中的大多数人都会帮你修剪。
[00:25:07.210] Haven't seen my new place have even seen Rala yet
[00:25:07.210] 我还没见过我的新住处，甚至还没见过拉拉。
[00:25:10.250] You know and they know that Rala is such a big part of my life
[00:25:10.250] 你也知道，他们也知道，拉拉是我生命中非常重要的一部分。
[00:25:13.690] This obviously you're living alone
[00:25:13.690] 显然你是独居的。
[00:25:15.750] It's also a big like life changed for me
[00:25:15.750] 这对我来说也是一次巨大的生活改变。
[00:25:18.710] So if you're a friend of mine and you do treat me care about me
[00:25:18.710] 所以，如果你是我的朋友，你真心待我，关心我，那就说明你真心待我。
[00:25:22.270] I think you would make an effort to come down here
[00:25:22.270] 我想你会努力抽空来这里看看。
[00:25:24.430] Right
[00:25:24.430] 正确的
[00:25:25.130] Yeah, so that's that's where my thinking is and it's very black and white where okay
[00:25:25.130] 是的，这就是我的想法，而且这件事非常非黑即白，好吧。
[00:25:30.330] It's obvious if someone doesn't want to make the time for you and expects you to make time for them
[00:25:30.330] 如果有人不想抽出时间陪你，却指望你抽出时间陪他们，那显而易见。
[00:25:35.210] Then it's like it's uneven friendship and so those are like the social sort of events that I just don't really go to anymore
[00:25:35.210] 那样的话，友谊就变得不平衡了，所以那些社交活动我就基本不参加了。
[00:25:44.530] Yeah, that makes sense. I feel like it really makes you in your perspective
[00:25:44.530] 嗯，有道理。我觉得这真的能让你从自己的角度看待问题。
[00:25:48.430] It's like okay, it's like your turn as my friend to reciprocate
[00:25:48.430] 这就好，现在轮到你作为我的朋友回报我了。
[00:25:52.390] When like you've been putting in all this work previously to build up the friendship
[00:25:52.390] 当你之前投入了这么多精力来建立这段友谊时……
[00:25:57.630] And then now you're like okay, I can kind of see people's like true colors I guess
[00:25:57.630] 然后现在你就会想，好吧，我大概能看清人们的真面目了。
[00:26:02.710] Or maybe they just haven't reached a level of maturity that you have so maybe in the future years they could come around
[00:26:02.710] 或许他们只是还没达到你这样的成熟度，所以也许在未来的几年里他们会转变观念。
[00:26:10.450] Yeah, I know exactly. I mean it's I think before when you know single no dog
[00:26:10.450] 是的，我完全明白。我的意思是，我觉得以前你知道单身没有狗的时候就是这样。
[00:26:17.070] I had like so much free time, you know always wanted to see oh what's the plan?
[00:26:17.070] 我当时有很多空闲时间，你知道，总是想看看，哦，计划是什么？
[00:26:21.910] What's the move for Friday? What's the move for Saturday and stuff? You realize you cater a lot to people
[00:26:21.910] 周五的安排是什么？周六的安排是什么？等等。你会意识到你一直在迎合别人。
[00:26:28.830] And I'm an extravert too, so I don't think much of it at the time
[00:26:28.830] 而且我也是个外向的人，所以当时我并不太在意这件事。
[00:26:33.790] I don't like drive all the way to SF you know hot for one part of the other and stuff
[00:26:33.790] 我不喜欢一路开车去旧金山，你知道，那里的天气很热，而且……
[00:26:38.990] But now I don't have the means to cater to people
[00:26:38.990] 但我现在没有能力招待人们了。
[00:26:42.550] So there's very much people that like reach out to me like hey I'm having this like I will really really love it for you to come
[00:26:42.550] 所以很多人会联系我说：“嘿，我有个活动，我非常非常希望你能来。”
[00:26:50.230] And they were close friend my and then I'll come but then for the auxiliary friends that like invite me just to have
[00:26:50.230] 他们是我的好朋友，然后我会来，但也会邀请一些喜欢来的朋友来和我一起玩。
[00:26:57.950] I'd you know I sometimes think people like having me there because I'm I'm such a good aura
[00:26:57.950] 你知道吗，我有时觉得人们喜欢有我在身边，因为我给人的感觉很好。
[00:27:04.570] I read actually very live for the party sort of or I think people used to invite me because of that
[00:27:04.570] 我其实很喜欢参加聚会，或者说，我觉得以前人们邀请我就是因为这方面的原因。
[00:27:10.730] And now it's very much like you know just trimming that away
[00:27:10.730] 现在感觉就像是把那部分修剪掉一样。
[00:27:15.590] I always find it kind of fascinating to track what kind of role friendship plays in your life as you age
[00:27:15.590] 我总是觉得，随着年龄的增长，观察友谊在你的生活中扮演着怎样的角色，是一件非常有趣的事情。
[00:27:22.510] Because you know we talk often about how friendship in our teenage years looks so different from friendship now
[00:27:22.510] 因为你知道，我们经常谈到青少年时期的友谊和现在的友谊有多么不同。
[00:27:29.190] And I do feel like as our lifestyle changes what we need and seek out of friendship also changes too
[00:27:29.190] 而且我觉得，随着生活方式的改变，我们对友谊的需求和追求也会随之改变。
[00:27:35.590] And you know some of that might be like thinking about how you feel around certain friends
[00:27:35.590] 你知道，其中一些可能就像是在思考你和某些朋友在一起时的感受。
[00:27:41.690] or like how your life feels around certain friends and seeing the changes before and after them
[00:27:41.690] 或者就像你和某些朋友在一起时的生活感受，以及和他们相处前后的变化一样。
[00:27:47.930] But some of that can also be like yeah I love and want to keep these friends but I might want to change the activities that I do with these friends
[00:27:47.930] 但有时候也可能是这样的：是的，我爱这些朋友，也想和他们保持联系，但我可能想改变一下和他们一起做的活动。
[00:27:55.510] So I feel like I have seen both in my life personally
[00:27:55.510] 所以我觉得我个人的人生经历中这两种情况都见过。
[00:27:58.610] It's like sometimes you see friends come and go just because it might not be the best fit anymore at a certain age
[00:27:58.610] 有时候你会看到朋友来来去去，仅仅是因为到了某个年龄，彼此可能不再合适了。
[00:28:04.130] But other times the friends are the right people and you just switch up the activities
[00:28:04.130] 但有时候，朋友们就是对的人，你只需要换换活动就行了。
[00:28:07.690] Maybe do more sports or do more wholesome stuff and you enjoy that evolution as well
[00:28:07.690] 或许可以多参加运动，或者多做一些有益身心的事情，你也会享受这种变化。
[00:28:17.390] So one of my really close friend groups my college friends right because their college friends our activities are very much not wholesome
[00:28:17.390] 所以我的一群非常要好的朋友，我的大学朋友，因为他们的大学朋友，我们的活动非常不健康。
[00:28:26.050] And you know I'm joy type of friends right
[00:28:26.050] 你知道我喜欢开心的朋友，对吧？
[00:28:31.350] I'm loving because every single time we're trying to make this with oh jesus you met them right and so you know you can speak to this
[00:28:31.350] 我很喜欢，因为每次我们尝试这样做的时候，哦，天哪，你遇到了他们，对吧？所以你知道你可以谈谈这个。
[00:28:38.850] Yeah, we try having a wholesome night so me and jesus and I cover my college friends
[00:28:38.850] 是的，我们想度过一个温馨的夜晚，所以我和耶稣还有我的大学朋友们一起度过了美好的时光。
[00:28:44.330] We had a love island watch party for the reunion
[00:28:44.330] 我们为重聚举办了一场《爱情岛》观看派对。
[00:28:48.770] And I kid you not we're like okay, let's have it wholesome
[00:28:48.770] 我可没开玩笑，我们当时就想，好吧，那就让它健康向上吧。
[00:28:52.870] Maybe just get like a six pack right because there's like five of us. Let's just get a six pack and you know, we'll just have one drink each and that's it
[00:28:52.870] 或许就买六瓶装啤酒吧，因为我们有五个人。就买六瓶装，然后我们每人喝一杯，就这么简单。
[00:29:06.010] Not even we set out the dinner everyone seated down
[00:29:06.010] 甚至我们都没来得及摆好晚餐，大家都就坐下了。
[00:29:11.910] Not even one bite in one of my college friends goes
[00:29:11.910] 我一个大学朋友连一口都没吃。
[00:29:16.810] Sh I
[00:29:16.810] 什
[00:29:19.710] And you know me I I fold under no pressure at all like a fucking lawn chair
[00:29:19.710] 你知道我，我一点压力都不会犯困，就像一把该死的折叠椅。
[00:29:30.600] Oh, I ran my body. I ran the bottom of my hand. Let's do this
[00:29:30.600] 哦，我跑遍了我的身体。我跑遍了我的手掌底部。开始吧。
[00:29:34.960] It's pouring the shots. Yeah already
[00:29:34.960] 枪声大作。是啊，已经响起来了。
[00:29:37.540] That night was so funny right it was like oh there's only like a little bit in this bottle
[00:29:37.540] 那天晚上真是太搞笑了，就像是，哦，这瓶子里就剩一点点了。
[00:29:43.140] We might as well finish it and then it evolves into we didn't do this, but it did evolve into the question of
[00:29:43.140] 我们不妨把它完成，然后事情就演变成我们没做这件事，但它确实演变成一个问题：
[00:29:49.440] Should we door dash something like should we
[00:29:49.440] 我们应该像DoorDash那样送外卖吗？
[00:29:56.300] We legit we're like ask oh what liquor stores around here
[00:29:56.300] 我们真的会问，这附近有哪些酒类商店？
[00:30:01.000] I was like
[00:30:01.000] 我当时就像
[00:30:13.260] Shot stew you know, I'll leave it that way didn't just stop a shot
[00:30:13.260] 你知道，就是那种炖菜，我就说到这儿吧，我可没停下来。
[00:30:18.300] Do ball on the right side. I remember GC re-counting this night to me. She was like oh my god
[00:30:18.300] 把球打到右边。我记得GC那天晚上跟我复述过这件事。她当时就惊呼：“我的天哪！”
[00:30:22.880] I went over to Jimmy's to watch love island with him and his college friends
[00:30:22.880] 我去吉米家和他以及他的大学朋友们一起看《爱情岛》。
[00:30:26.480] And she was like wow Jimmy's place is like so nice. He really decorated
[00:30:26.480] 她当时就惊叹道：“哇，吉米的家真漂亮！他真的把那里装饰得漂漂亮亮的。”
[00:30:30.980] It is truly a like nice bachelor of had essentially
[00:30:30.980] 这真像是一个不错的单身汉，基本上
[00:30:35.740] Boy, yeah, I was so struck by the like floating shelves with a plant and stuff
[00:30:35.740] 哎呀，是啊，我当时就被那种摆着植物之类的悬浮架子惊艳到了。
[00:30:41.820] I was like oh, how crystal like Jerry's face is amazing
[00:30:41.820] 我当时就想，哇，杰瑞的脸真清晰，太神奇了。
[00:30:46.140] And I was like oh my god. We need to go again. I haven't seen it yet still in person
[00:30:46.140] 我当时就想，我的天哪，我们得再去一次。我还没亲眼看过呢。
[00:30:51.940] You ever see it? I haven't seen your place in person yet. Yeah, cuz you didn't do a house for me
[00:30:51.940] 你见过吗？我还没亲自去过你家呢。是啊，因为你没给我盖房子。
[00:30:57.740] True, but going back to my point right like true friends
[00:30:57.740] 没错，但回到我刚才说的重点，就像真正的朋友一样。
[00:31:05.860] You're the exception, okay? You're the exception. Yeah, I'm just really bad
[00:31:05.860] 你是例外，好吗？你是例外。是啊，我就是太差劲了。
[00:31:13.040] Inviting people over for you know housewarming like setting something up as well
[00:31:13.040] 邀请朋友来家里参加乔迁派对之类的活动，也算是庆祝一下吧。
[00:31:18.080] That's just like not my nature. I'm very much
[00:31:18.080] 那根本不是我的本性。我非常
[00:31:22.040] Invite tea and not in a fighter
[00:31:22.040] 邀请朋友喝茶，而不是邀请朋友打架。
[00:31:25.640] The only time my place has usage is like for the afters, you know people go oh that's just going to Jimmy's after
[00:31:25.640] 我家唯一有人用的时候就是聚会之后，你知道，人们会说哦，那只是去吉米家而已。
[00:31:32.880] We'll just continue tonight there but it's never anything like oh that's going on my house
[00:31:32.880] 我们今晚会继续在那里，但从来不会像“哦，那事发生在我家”那样。
[00:31:38.940] Like the house for me
[00:31:38.940] 就像这房子一样。
[00:31:43.200] But I do feel like Jimmy you're kind of the person who would be like if someone hit you up kind of last minute
[00:31:43.200] 但我感觉吉米，你就是那种如果有人临时联系你，你可能会答应的人。
[00:31:49.100] Like Harry free right now. Let's grab a beer and like wash the game together at your place
[00:31:49.100] 哈利现在有空。咱们去你那儿喝杯啤酒，一起玩游戏吧。
[00:31:53.240] You'd be like oh yeah, sure no one's done it yet, but yeah
[00:31:53.240] 你会想，哦，是啊，当然还没人这么做过，但是，是的
[00:31:58.040] All right, it's on my to do list now
[00:31:58.040] 好的，现在它已经列入我的待办事项清单了。
[00:32:01.800] Put it on the board the whiteboard
[00:32:01.800] 把它写在白板上
[00:32:05.260] Now that you guys are in our fancy football week now have people in the Bay Area that watch football
[00:32:05.260] 现在你们正沉浸在我们精彩的橄榄球周中，湾区也有不少人看橄榄球比赛。
[00:32:13.360] So we will have wash parties. That's true. Yeah, and we have like at least three locations
[00:32:13.360] 所以我们会举办洗澡派对。没错。是的，我们至少有三个地点。
[00:32:18.540] We could do it. Yeah, the relocations right here
[00:32:18.540] 我们可以做到。是的，就是这里的搬迁。
[00:32:22.600] Us three
[00:32:22.600] 我们三个
[00:32:26.120] Well, I do want to circle back to something that Jimmy said earlier
[00:32:26.120] 嗯，我想再说说吉米之前说过的话。
[00:32:30.000] Which I thought was interesting you said that 25 was a pretty pivotal year for you
[00:32:30.000] 我觉得你说25岁对你来说是一个非常关键的年份很有意思。
[00:32:34.620] And I think honestly it was for me too and something that we discussed a lot on this podcast is like the concept of the frontal lobe
[00:32:34.620] 说实话，我觉得对我来说也是如此，我们在播客里也多次讨论过额叶的概念。
[00:32:43.880] Where you know 25 allegedly is when your frontal lobe is supposed to be fully developed
[00:32:43.880] 你知道吗，据说25岁的时候额叶应该完全发育成熟。
[00:32:49.800] So do you guys think that rings true to your experience when you look back at your age 25?
[00:32:49.800] 那么，你们回首25岁时的经历，觉得这符合你们的感受吗？
[00:32:57.500] Hopefully not
[00:32:57.500] 希望不会
[00:32:59.860] Hopefully it's so developing
[00:32:59.860] 希望它能发展得这么顺利。
[00:33:03.640] You're like this can't be it
[00:33:03.640] 你就像在说“这不可能是真的”。
[00:33:06.880] This can't be it. It's got a much more development to do
[00:33:06.880] 不可能就此结束。它还有很多发展空间。
[00:33:10.160] I do feel like there was a little bit of change though. I started realizing I cared more about consequences kind of like things scared me a little more if that makes sense
[00:33:10.160] 不过，我感觉自己确实发生了一些变化。我开始意识到自己更在意后果了，好像有些事情让我更害怕了，不知道这样说你能不能理解。
[00:33:22.460] It would be like, oh well, if I were to procrastinate on work
[00:33:22.460] 如果我拖延工作，那就糟了。
[00:33:26.080] I know the consequences of that like I'll have to work extra harder later and that's annoying right
[00:33:26.080] 我知道那样做会有什么后果，比如我之后得更努力工作，这很烦人，对吧。
[00:33:32.120] But then I feel like in my younger years I literally was like doing a homework five minutes before class started
[00:33:32.120] 但后来我感觉，年轻的时候，我经常会在上课前五分钟才开始做作业。
[00:33:38.080] I'm like turning it in you know
[00:33:38.080] 你知道，我都准备把它交上去了。
[00:33:40.200] It's like whatever like I'm invincible like there's no consequences as long as I could have done
[00:33:40.200] 感觉就像无所谓，好像我刀枪不入，好像只要我能做到，就不会有任何后果。
[00:33:46.120] But now it's like that could affect like my schedule my routine and that could just like knock over all these other aspects that I just like wouldn't have necessarily thought about what I was younger
[00:33:46.120] 但现在看来，这可能会影响我的日程安排、我的日常作息，甚至会影响到我年轻时可能不会考虑到的其他方面。
[00:33:58.300] Yeah, I mean I think when I look back at age 25 life started to feel really real for me
[00:33:58.300] 是的，我的意思是，当我回首25岁的时候，我觉得生活才真正开始变得真实起来。
[00:34:03.820] I was like everything that I do in every year now and on words it's going to be like something that I look back on when I'm like in my 40s or 50s I'll be like, oh man
[00:34:03.820] 我感觉自己每年所做的一切，以及用文字表达出来的一切，都会成为我四五十岁时回首往事时会感慨万千的事情。
[00:34:14.540] It could be something like, oh man, I wish I did this when I was 25 or I wish I did this you know
[00:34:14.540] 可能是这样的：哎呀，我真希望我25岁的时候就做了这件事，或者，我真希望我当时做了这件事，你知道吗？
[00:34:19.740] So then I think I got really aware of like things that I might potentially regret not doing in a certain sense
[00:34:19.740] 所以，我觉得我开始真正意识到，从某种意义上说，有些事情我可能会后悔没去做。
[00:34:26.280] And also it was the year where I really wanted to start doing like building blocks on things that could set me up in the future
[00:34:26.280] 而且那一年，我真的想开始做一些基础性的工作，为未来打下基础。
[00:34:35.840] Specifically just relationship wise for me and James
[00:34:35.840] 具体来说，就我和詹姆斯的关系而言。
[00:34:38.600] I think that's when we started having pretty serious conversations about in the next five years what are the things we want to do on our checklist
[00:34:38.600] 我认为正是从那时起，我们开始认真讨论未来五年我们想在清单上完成哪些事情。
[00:34:45.180] So yeah, maybe it's the combination of like the frontal lobe thing and also
[00:34:45.180] 所以，也许是额叶功能和其他因素共同作用的结果。
[00:34:50.440] Just hitting that like mid 20s number
[00:34:50.440] 刚好达到25岁左右的那个数字
[00:34:53.840] But I think it was good like I think it was very developmental and it felt a little bit more serious
[00:34:53.840] 但我认为这很好，我觉得它很有发展意义，而且感觉也更严肃一些。
[00:34:59.760] Well, I went through all five 25
[00:34:59.760] 嗯，我把所有五个25个都看完了。
[00:35:03.900] I think
[00:35:03.900] 我认为
[00:35:05.820] With the ladies and the sales
[00:35:05.820] 与女士们和销售
[00:35:10.560] And just I think it's just getting right in developing healthy habits
[00:35:10.560] 我觉得关键在于培养健康的生活习惯。
[00:35:15.220] Like I speak more for for weed for example, even when I was a working man before a 25
[00:35:15.220] 比如，我更倾向于谈论大麻，即使在我25岁之前还是个上班族的时候也是如此。
[00:35:22.260] I would smoke weed all the time like legit hit a flinky
[00:35:22.260] 我以前经常抽大麻，就像真的抽了一根flinky一样。
[00:35:28.220] I was a researcher before
[00:35:28.220] 我以前是一名研究员。
[00:35:31.120] I would legit hit a flinky then you go back to the bench and start like pipetting shit
[00:35:31.120] 我真的会打个响指，然后回到工作台开始像滴管一样胡扯。
[00:35:36.880] And then like before sales calls
[00:35:36.880] 然后就像销售电话之前那样。
[00:35:39.600] I would do that too. I was a very high functioning smoker
[00:35:39.600] 我也会那样做。我以前是个烟瘾很大的烟民。
[00:35:43.700] But then I realized like it's almost like a fucking rock lead taking off his ankle weights
[00:35:43.700] 但后来我意识到，这就像一个该死的摇滚巨星卸下脚踝上的负重一样。
[00:35:49.540] I stopped doing that and I'm like oh shit, I'm so much better my job now
[00:35:49.540] 我停止做那件事之后，我就想，糟了，我现在的工作好多了。
[00:35:55.540] It's a lot growing is a lot of making responsible decisions
[00:35:55.540] 成长需要做出很多负责任的决定
[00:35:59.520] Honestly to just stay in true to yourself and
[00:35:59.520] 说实话，就是要忠于自己。
[00:36:02.760] Honestly protecting your own self worth a lot more aggressively
[00:36:02.760] 坦诚地、更积极地维护自己的自尊
[00:36:09.600] I thought one interesting thing I noticed as I turned 25 I guess actually was having more anxiety
[00:36:09.600] 我注意到，25岁那年一件很有趣的事，那就是我的焦虑感似乎增强了。
[00:36:17.400] And I think it's because like somewhere subconsciously or consciously
[00:36:17.400] 我认为这是因为在某种程度上，无论是潜意识里还是意识里……
[00:36:22.280] I was like realizing there's some danger in like some choices that I made potentially
[00:36:22.280] 我当时意识到，我做出的一些选择可能存在一些危险。
[00:36:28.720] Or just like things that I was doing would like freak out my subconscious of it
[00:36:28.720] 或者就像我做的某些事情会让我潜意识里感到不安一样。
[00:36:35.820] So I guess as an example sometimes I like take solo travel trips for the most part
[00:36:35.820] 所以，举个例子来说，我大部分时间都喜欢独自旅行。
[00:36:41.140] It's like fine, but I'm still like just a woman traveling alone
[00:36:41.140] 感觉还不错，但我依然只是个独自旅行的女人。
[00:36:45.480] And that's kind of like freaky in some aspects and it's like oh you need to stay pretty visually
[00:36:45.480] 从某种程度上来说，这有点怪异，就好像你需要保持良好的视觉效果一样。
[00:36:50.700] Like be aware of your surroundings and all of that kind of stuff
[00:36:50.700] 比如注意周围环境之类的。
[00:36:53.860] So because I was like noticing more anxiety
[00:36:53.860] 因为我注意到自己越来越焦虑了。
[00:36:58.460] I had to look into like ways of managing my anxiety
[00:36:58.460] 我不得不寻找其他方法来控制我的焦虑
[00:37:02.000] Whether that meant like doing things that made me feel more prepared or like doing things that were good for like mental health and wellness
[00:37:02.000] 无论是做一些让我感觉准备更充分的事情，还是做一些有益于心理健康和幸福感的事情。
[00:37:10.580] So I think like that was a trigger that made me focus a little more on like overall well being
[00:37:10.580] 所以我觉得那件事就像一个触发点，让我开始更加关注整体健康。
[00:37:19.000] That's kind of interesting actually because I feel like for me
[00:37:19.000] 这其实挺有意思的，因为我觉得对我来说
[00:37:23.000] I had the opposite experience where I started to experience a little bit less anxiety
[00:37:23.000] 我的经历正好相反，我的焦虑感开始有所减轻。
[00:37:27.600] But maybe it's almost like life balancing out
[00:37:27.600] 但或许这就像是生活的一种平衡。
[00:37:32.540] Because I was just so anxious like growing up
[00:37:32.540] 因为我从小就非常焦虑。
[00:37:36.120] But I started to give less of a shit about certain things
[00:37:36.120] 但我对某些事情开始变得不那么在意了。
[00:37:40.500] Like I've had I used to care so much about what other people thought of me
[00:37:40.500] 就像我以前那样，我曾经非常在意别人对我的看法。
[00:37:44.080] To where it was like distracting and just invasive as a thought
[00:37:44.080] 这种想法令人分心，而且极具侵入性。
[00:37:48.280] And it's not to say that I don't care now because I definitely do care
[00:37:48.280] 这并不是说我现在不在乎，因为我当然在乎。
[00:37:52.280] But maybe it's more at like a normal level and less as like a debilitating factor in life
[00:37:52.280] 但或许它更像是一种正常水平，而不是生活中一种令人衰弱的因素。
[00:37:58.280] So I think for me it was also like a little bit of a positive change
[00:37:58.280] 所以我觉得对我来说，这也算是一种小小的积极变化。
[00:38:02.720] I can feel those thoughts of oh hopefully this person likes me but it doesn't have to be like all consuming
[00:38:02.720] 我能感受到那种“希望这个人喜欢我”的想法，但这并不意味着我会完全沉浸其中。
[00:38:09.840] Okay, what do you guys think of this?
[00:38:09.840] 你们觉得怎么样？
[00:38:12.180] I feel like 25 mid to early 20s. It's almost like a second puberty
[00:38:12.180] 我感觉自己像25岁，或者20岁出头。这感觉就像经历了第二次青春期。
[00:38:16.920] Like you're really starting to grow into who I guess like close or tear final evolution
[00:38:16.920] 就像你真的开始成长为我猜想的那种接近或撕裂最终进化的人一样
[00:38:24.740] And you go through a lot of potential changes or like re-evaluations of your life
[00:38:24.740] 你会经历很多潜在的变化，或者说是对人生的重新评估。
[00:38:30.240] Because it's a big time of change
[00:38:30.240] 因为这是一个变革的时代。
[00:38:33.980] Graduating college we're like getting our jobs
[00:38:33.980] 大学毕业就像找到工作一样
[00:38:36.700] Figuring out what we want to do with the rest of our life
[00:38:36.700] 弄清楚我们余生想做什么
[00:38:39.740] So I almost view this time as like a second puberty
[00:38:39.740] 所以我几乎把这段时间看作是第二次青春期。
[00:38:42.740] I think in that sense it's sort of like reverses some of the I guess negative stuff that came with your first puberty
[00:38:42.740] 我认为从这个意义上讲，它有点像逆转了你第一次青春期带来的一些负面影响。
[00:38:54.620] Right because the first puberty is when you started feeling more anxious about
[00:38:54.620] 没错，因为第一次青春期就是你开始感到更加焦虑的时候。
[00:38:59.100] Oh, what do people care? You know like how do people see me you care a lot about it
[00:38:59.100] 哦，别人在乎什么呢？你知道，比如别人怎么看我，你很在乎这个。
[00:39:04.540] Just stuff that doesn't really matter
[00:39:04.540] 一些无关紧要的事情
[00:39:06.780] And so in that sense this you know quote quote second puberty is sort of when you're reversing that
[00:39:06.780] 所以从这个意义上讲，所谓的“第二次青春期”其实就是逆转那种状态的过程。
[00:39:13.320] It's like oh things like that don't actually matter and you start zeroing in other things that do matter to you
[00:39:13.320] 就好像，哦，那些事其实并不重要，然后你开始专注于其他对你真正重要的事情。
[00:39:21.760] Like fulfilling relationships family time
[00:39:21.760] 就像充实的家庭时光一样
[00:39:26.600] Yeah, I don't know. I think you just started becoming more of a null really you know start selling it
[00:39:26.600] 是啊，我不知道。我觉得你只是开始变得越来越像个废物了，你知道，开始卖东西了。
[00:39:31.620] Second puberty in that sense
[00:39:31.620] 从这个意义上讲，第二次青春期。
[00:39:34.000] I think one of the interesting things about being in my late twenties is I almost feel like I have two conflicting emotions going on
[00:39:34.000] 我觉得二十七八岁这个年纪最有趣的事情之一就是，我感觉自己同时拥有两种相互矛盾的情绪。
[00:39:42.000] Like half of me is so excited to be 30 because I feel like being 30 and being in your 30s onwards is first fall almost like a fresh start
[00:39:42.000] 我一半的心情都特别兴奋，因为我觉得30岁，以及30岁以后的人生，就像是人生的第一个秋天，一个全新的开始。
[00:39:50.040] It's like you're starting your new decade with the bang
[00:39:50.040] 就像你以一声巨响开启了新的十年。
[00:39:53.420] But also at the same time like I'm so scared of hitting 30 or like leaving my 20s
[00:39:53.420] 但与此同时，我又很害怕步入30岁，或者说害怕告别20多岁。
[00:40:01.080] Happened me is just like waiting in anticipation like I'm just like waiting and like watching the countdown timer to 30
[00:40:01.080] 对我来说，感觉就像是在充满期待地等待，就像在看着倒计时到30分一样。
[00:40:06.980] And I just I don't know like I don't know how to deal with these conflicting emotions in a sense
[00:40:06.980] 我真的不知道，我不知道该如何处理这些矛盾的情绪。
[00:40:12.820] Like it almost feels like I'm in limbo while also trying to like live up the last few years of my 20s
[00:40:12.820] 感觉自己好像处于一种进退两难的境地，同时又努力想好好度过20多岁的最后几年。
[00:40:20.120] That makes sense. I'm on the opposite and I'm not trying to think about being 30
[00:40:20.120] 这说得通。我正好相反，我不想去想30岁这件事。
[00:40:25.920] It's not approaching. I don't want to think about it
[00:40:25.920] 它还没临近。我不想去想它。
[00:40:28.480] I think I'm on Jimmy's side for this
[00:40:28.480] 我觉得这件事上我站在吉米这边。
[00:40:31.070] Just don't think too if I'm catch myself thinking about 30 I'm like stop
[00:40:31.070] 只是别想太多，如果我发现自己在想30岁，我就会赶紧停下来。
[00:40:35.420] No, yeah, not yet
[00:40:35.420] 不，还没有。
[00:40:37.340] So at the point you like you do some dumb shit and your 30 you're gonna be like why did I do that fucking 30
[00:40:37.340] 所以当你到了30岁，做了些蠢事之后，你会想：我30岁的时候为什么要做那件蠢事？
[00:40:46.280] Oh, you can't be like oh, I'm just 20 something
[00:40:46.280] 哦，你不能说“哦，我才二十出头”。
[00:40:50.680] Yeah, I'm just 20. Hey, there's a lot of like expectations to once you hit 30 and above right and especially in the Bay Area too
[00:40:50.680] 是啊，我才20岁。哎，一旦过了30岁，尤其是在湾区，就会有很多期望，对吧？
[00:41:03.640] Like you know what milestones you got hit well you got to get married in your 30s
[00:41:03.640] 就像你知道你达成了哪些人生里程碑一样，比如你在30多岁的时候结婚了。
[00:41:11.320] You got to essentially you know have a kid in your 30s get house in your 30s
[00:41:11.320] 基本上，你得在30多岁的时候生孩子，在30多岁的时候买房子。
[00:41:16.920] You know some big-ass responsibilities and that's the type of stuff that like it's like a low intimidating
[00:41:16.920] 你知道，有些责任非常重大，这类事情会让人感到有点害怕。
[00:41:23.100] And I'm also excited for it going to crystal it's gonna be your third puberty. I guess
[00:41:23.100] 我也很兴奋，因为克里斯托尔即将迎来你的第三次青春期。我想是这样的。
[00:41:30.260] Down you right
[00:41:30.260] 往右下方走
[00:41:32.580] When you're legit like oh fuck I got to settle the fuck down how many puberty is must we go through before it stops
[00:41:32.580] 当你真的觉得“卧槽，我得冷静下来了”，然后意识到“我们到底要经历多少次青春期才能结束”的时候，这种感觉就来了。
[00:41:44.240] I think honestly we have a big break between like 30 up until 50 when your kids leave for college
[00:41:44.240] 说实话，我觉得从30岁到50岁之间，孩子上大学这段时间，我们人生中会有一段很长的过渡期。
[00:41:52.900] Like another puberty like oh shit what what do I do you know
[00:41:52.900] 就像又一次青春期，哦，天哪，我该怎么办？你知道吗？
[00:41:57.020] That's why they have been life crises at 50
[00:41:57.020] 这就是为什么50岁会遭遇人生危机的原因。
[00:42:02.000] Yeah, yeah, so I might step down on my mom all bought porches and shit
[00:42:02.000] 是啊，是啊，所以我可能会踩着我妈买的那些门廊什么的往下走。
[00:42:08.040] Yeah, like damn dude you only need this task of a car you drive 65 on the right
[00:42:08.040] 是啊，老兄，你只需要这辆车就能完成任务，你开着它在右边以65英里的时速行驶。
[00:42:12.800] Right way, no, you're like hey, can I borrow this car?
[00:42:12.800] 没错，不，你会说，嘿，我可以借这辆车吗？
[00:42:16.800] I mean honestly, I think parenthood could also be a puberty too because puberty to me is like when you learn so much about yourself and you're like unfamiliar
[00:42:16.800] 说实话，我觉得为人父母也可以算作青春期，因为对我来说，青春期就像是了解自己很多事情，同时又感到很陌生。
[00:42:25.180] And like growing in that unfamiliarity and I think parenthood will be very new and strange for all of us
[00:42:25.180] 就像在陌生环境中成长一样，我认为为人父母对我们所有人来说都将是全新而陌生的体验。
[00:42:32.860] So honestly it's infinite puberty
[00:42:32.860] 所以说，这简直就是永无止境的青春期。
[00:42:36.760] Yeah, yeah, you got to go with your kids puberty
[00:42:36.760] 是啊，是啊，你得顺其自然，迎接孩子的青春期。
[00:42:40.740] That's probably your own you know, I'm sure
[00:42:40.740] 那很可能是你自己的东西，我敢肯定。
[00:42:43.020] I don't do it this fucking devil
[00:42:43.020] 我不干这该死的恶魔
[00:42:46.080] You're like wait was I like that when I'm just a little crisis too
[00:42:46.080] 你会想，等等，我以前也这样吗？那时候我也只是有点小危机而已。
[00:42:51.860] Yeah, oh my god, yeah
[00:42:51.860] 是啊，我的天哪，是啊
[00:42:54.160] I remember when I was you know going to puberty I guess I was sneak out all the time with you
[00:42:54.160] 我记得我大概是在青春期的时候，经常偷偷溜出去和你玩。
[00:42:59.620] You're so good times
[00:42:59.620] 你真是美好的时光
[00:43:03.800] Go to denies, you know my dad was literally like crystal you became like the devil spawn
[00:43:03.800] 去否认吧，你知道我爸简直就像水晶一样，你却变成了魔鬼的化身。
[00:43:13.200] Oh my god I had this conversation with my mom recently too
[00:43:13.200] 我的天哪，我最近也和我妈聊过这个话题！
[00:43:17.320] She was like yeah, your puberty came kind of late more when you were like 1780
[00:43:17.320] 她当时说，是啊，你的青春期来得比较晚，大概是1780年左右。
[00:43:22.020] Like I don't know why you didn't go through it whenever and also is going through it
[00:43:22.020] 我不知道为什么你之前没有经历过，现在却要经历。
[00:43:26.040] Not the belated flames like 10 years later
[00:43:26.040] 不是十年后才燃起的迟来的火焰。
[00:43:30.720] Like why are we talking about this right now?
[00:43:30.720] 我们现在为什么要讨论这个？
[00:43:34.000] By the way you're a chic kid
[00:43:34.000] 顺便说一句，你真是个时髦的孩子
[00:43:37.780] And not only that too, like you waited to be a chic kid
[00:43:37.780] 不仅如此，你好像一直盼着自己能成为一个时髦的孩子。
[00:43:44.900] Yeah, another thing about it oh man, I don't know how I'm going to go through it
[00:43:44.900] 是啊，还有一件事，哎，我不知道我该怎么熬过去。
[00:43:48.220] Like when I was a kid oh my god
[00:43:48.220] 就像我小时候那样，我的天哪
[00:43:51.240] From home without to deal with like weed smell
[00:43:51.240] 在家无需处理诸如大麻气味之类的问题
[00:43:54.160] It's stuff you know in the house there's one time I snuck out and actually no when I sneak out I'd put like you know pillows
[00:43:54.160] 就是那种你知道在家里的东西，有一次我偷偷溜出去，其实不，我偷偷溜出去的时候会把枕头之类的东西放进去。
[00:44:01.860] Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
[00:44:01.860] 我的天啊，我的天啊，我的天啊
[00:44:04.700] And then I had like a Halloween mask with hair in it so I put that to my dog and stuff
[00:44:04.700] 然后我有个万圣节面具，里面有毛，我就把它戴在了我的狗身上之类的。
[00:44:12.220] And then one time she caught me because I was being stupid and I took my car
[00:44:12.220] 有一次，我做了件蠢事，开着车被她抓住了，当时我真是蠢透了。
[00:44:17.560] So she was like where the fuck is this car she went up she actually that all this mother
[00:44:17.560] 所以她就问，这车到底在哪儿？她上去之后，其实她把这一切都告诉了妈妈。
[00:44:26.540] You really thought some pillows would fool her like the way crazy actually
[00:44:26.540] 你真以为几个枕头就能骗过她，真是疯了！
[00:44:32.900] Yeah, I should have just walked to that yeah
[00:44:32.900] 是啊，我应该直接走过去的。
[00:44:35.420] The place that we went to was like five minute walk and move is too long for sure
[00:44:35.420] 我们去的地方步行只需五分钟，但搬家却太远了，这绝对太久了。
[00:44:41.900] Well, I do have a final question for us before we wrap this episode
[00:44:41.900] 好了，在结束本期节目之前，我还有一个问题要问大家。
[00:44:45.940] We basically talked about the evolution of our life from our early 20s through our late 20s and now that you kind of look back a little bit on our late 20s specifically
[00:44:45.940] 我们主要聊了聊从二十出头到二十七八岁的人生历程，现在回过头来看，尤其是我们二十七八岁那段时间。
[00:44:57.140] What grade would you give what?
[00:44:57.140] 你会给它打几分？
[00:45:00.840] On like a A through F scale what grade are you giving life in your late 20s
[00:45:00.840] 如果用A到F的等级来评价你20多岁时的生活，你给自己打几分？
[00:45:07.300] Honestly, I'll give myself like an A minus
[00:45:07.300] 说实话，我给自己打个A-吧。
[00:45:11.700] Maybe like a B plus I would say a B plus you know like a like where it's at I like where I am right now
[00:45:11.700] 大概B+吧，我觉得B+，你知道，就是现在这个水平，我挺喜欢我现在的状态。
[00:45:19.820] I like where it's going there's certain things I could have done better for the most parts. That's pretty good
[00:45:19.820] 我喜欢它现在的发展方向，虽然大部分地方我本可以做得更好。这已经很不错了。
[00:45:26.460] It's all the B plus, you know, it's like a eight and I'm playing five you know
[00:45:26.460] 都是B+，你知道，就像是8分，而我却只打5分，你知道吗？
[00:45:30.980] Oh, yeah, I'll go to the teacher. You're like hey, can you you bump me up to A minus?
[00:45:30.980] 哦，对，我会去找老师。你会说：“嘿，你能帮我把成绩提高到A-吗？”
[00:45:37.200] It's very close. I don't want to give myself a yeah, I think similar to crystal I would give it like a solid A minus
[00:45:37.200] 非常接近。我不想给自己打个“是”，我觉得它跟水晶差不多，我会给它打个扎实的A-。
[00:45:46.320] But I think definitely something to like monitor like even if it is and a it's like a 93 or something like about to get into A minus territory
[00:45:46.320] 但我认为绝对应该像监控设备一样，即使它只有93分左右，或者快要降到A-级了。
[00:45:54.220] Oh, yeah, I'm like almost B plus territory
[00:45:54.220] 哦，是啊，我差不多快到B+的水平了。
[00:45:57.200] Oh, there it is
[00:45:57.200] 哦，找到了。
[00:46:00.000] Crystal's writing that 90 percent
[00:46:00.000] 克里斯特尔写道，90%
[00:46:02.300] I'm like 90.0
[00:46:02.300] 我大概90.0
[00:46:07.380] I'm like oh shit, we made it to A minus
[00:46:07.380] 我当时就想，卧槽，我们居然拿到A-了！
[00:46:12.840] This is the shot
[00:46:12.840] 这是镜头
[00:46:15.280] I would say B plus just because there are some projects in my life that I've you know, I want to do and I bought the equipment to do but just haven't done it yet
[00:46:15.280] 我会给它打B+，因为我生活中还有一些项目，你知道，我想做，也买了设备，但就是还没开始做。
[00:46:28.180] You know, like I bought a wrangler and I want to take it off-roading but I haven't had the time to do it right
[00:46:28.180] 你知道，就像我买了辆牧马人，想开它去越野，但我一直没时间好好弄。
[00:46:36.620] I could blame Ryle all the time like oh, you know, I got to take care of Ryle
[00:46:36.620] 我可以一直把责任推给莱尔，比如，你知道，我得照顾莱尔。
[00:46:41.420] But if I'm being choose for my okay, but also waste my time doing some other stuff right
[00:46:41.420] 但如果我被选中是因为我同意，但同时也浪费时间去做其他正确的事情，那也行。
[00:46:46.220] And then I bought like a expensive camera too and I went just like video tape me cooking or me you know DJing and stuff and like just make like videos of that
[00:46:46.220] 然后我还买了一台很贵的相机，就开始拍我做饭、打碟之类的视频，就拍这些内容。
[00:46:57.820] Haven't gone around to it. Okay, there's still two more years of our late 20s
[00:46:57.820] 还没来得及做。好吧，我们还有两年才到三十岁末。
[00:47:02.820] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:47:02.820] 是啊，是啊，是啊
[00:47:04.940] I got a couple of semesters alone
[00:47:04.940] 我独自待了几个学期。
