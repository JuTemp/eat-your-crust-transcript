[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal. So I have a mini life update and this isn't really an update to anyone except for me and my close friends.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。我今天想跟大家分享一下我的近况，不过这其实只跟我和我的几个好朋友有关。
[00:00:22.490] But recently I've made the decision to take out my hormonal IUD. This is crazy to me because I have been with my IUD slash IUDs for 10 years. So the last time I wasn't on my IUD was I think March of 2015. Whoa. So this is a big decision. Everyone keeps asking me like, oh my god, does that mean you guys are trying?
[00:00:22.490] 但最近我决定取出我的激素宫内节育器。这对我来说简直难以置信，因为我已经用了十年宫内节育器了。上次没用它好像是2015年3月。哇哦。所以这对我来说是个重大决定。大家都问我，天哪，这是否意味着你们在备孕？
[00:00:46.970] And it's like no. I just felt the need to flush my body out of like the hormones for a little bit just because it's literally been a decade. With that comes all of these new learnings and thoughts. So we thought that we would do an episode today about female hormonal health, birth control and all the joys that come with these subjects. Mm hmm. Dude, I'm just imagining your IUD being like, oh my god, happy 10th anniversary. And you're like, okay, bye. I'm like, I'm evicting you.
[00:00:46.970] 不，我只是想让身体里的激素水平稍微调整一下，毕竟都十年了。随之而来的是很多新的知识和想法。所以我们今天决定做一期关于女性荷尔蒙健康、避孕以及这些话题带来的种种乐趣的节目。嗯哼。哥们儿，我都能想象你的宫内节育器说：“我的天哪，十周年快乐！”然后你就说：“好吧，拜拜。”我就说：“我要把你赶出去。”
[00:01:16.170] I mean, honestly, it has been such a big transition for me. Mm hmm. The biggest thing is that with my Mirena IUD, I had never had my period for the last 10 years. Crazy. I took it out. I think the moment we got back from this bachelorette of our friends, we literally flew back that Sunday from Vegas. And then Monday morning at like 8am, I booked the IUD removal. Oh my god, I fucking remember this.
[00:01:16.170] 说真的，这对我来说是个巨大的转变。嗯哼。最不可思议的是，自从用了曼月乐宫内节育器之后，我整整十年都没来过月经。太疯狂了。我把它取出来了。我记得我们参加完朋友的单身派对回来后，周日就从拉斯维加斯飞回来了。然后周一早上八点左右，我就预约了取出节育器的手术。我的天哪，我居然还记得这件事。
[00:01:43.530] We were all like, wait, you're getting it out in the morning tomorrow? 24 hours later. But yeah, it was kind of interesting. Like, I don't think the removal or the insertion was ever that crazy painful for me. So it wasn't horrible. But getting my period back has been crazy. I just kind of feel like a teenager again. Yeah, I remember when you finally got your first period.
[00:01:43.530] 我们当时都说，等等，你明天早上就要取出来了？24小时后。不过，这感觉还挺有意思的。我觉得取出或者放置的时候都没那么疼，所以也没那么可怕。但是月经恢复之后感觉很奇妙，就像回到了青春期一样。对啊，我还记得你第一次来月经的时候。
[00:02:08.690] You mentioned it to some of the girls and I was like, oh my god, welcome to girlhood. Like, I can't believe you haven't had a period for 10 years. Dude, yeah. And honestly, a lot has changed. For example, since I haven't had a period for 10 years, I don't have any of the equipment. I didn't have any panty liners or like tampons or pads or anything. So I had to rebuy all of it.
[00:02:08.690] 你跟几个女生提到了这件事，我就说，我的天哪，欢迎来到少女时代。我简直不敢相信你十年没来月经了。哥们儿，是啊。说真的，很多事情都变了。比如说，因为我十年没来月经了，所以我什么卫生用品都没有。护垫、卫生棉条、卫生巾什么的都没有。所以我得重新买一遍。
[00:02:33.270] And I feel like the product landscape or maybe like the marketing landscape of period products has changed so much since I was last buying them. Because I was purchasing in like the playtech sport, tennis players and all the period ads, you know, really vibrant, bright colors like that era, which I think still exists today. But now there's a lot more organic, clean, full cotton options that I had never seen before. Or I just maybe didn't think to purchase back then.
[00:02:33.270] 我觉得自从我上次买生理期用品以来，产品格局或者说市场营销格局发生了翻天覆地的变化。以前我买的都是那种印着Playtech运动、网球运动员之类的广告，各种鲜艳亮丽的颜色，就像那个年代的风格，我觉得现在这种风格依然存在。但现在市面上多了很多以前从未见过的有机棉、纯棉、成分天然的产品。或许我当时根本就没想过要买。
[00:03:03.390] There's just way more options now. I think period panties started to like really get popular when maybe we were in college. But when I was in high school, it was still like, you know, you have to go to Asia to buy these. Or like it was just more readily available outside of the U.S. at the time. So all of this stuff is very new to me. And I was just like, wow, I can't believe I can just buy like a full cotton option in the U.S. Yeah, that's true.
[00:03:03.390] 现在选择真的多多了。我觉得生理期内裤真正开始流行起来，大概是在我们上大学那会儿。但我上高中的时候，感觉还得去亚洲才能买到。或者说，那时候在美国以外的地方更容易买到。所以这些东西对我来说都很新鲜。我当时就想，哇，真不敢相信我居然能在美国买到全棉的生理期内裤。是啊，确实如此。
[00:03:29.890] Actually, I've always leaned towards using full cotton for pads and even tampons if available. The selection has definitely grown because I think it's definitely more of a like recent thing where people are like caring more about what they're putting in slash against their body. Originally, for me, it was because sometimes the non-cotton stuff can irritate my skin a little bit. Just like, I guess, chafing or whatever.
[00:03:29.890] 其实，我一直都比较喜欢用纯棉的卫生巾，如果可以的话，连卫生棉条我也用纯棉的。现在选择确实多了不少，我觉得这大概是最近大家开始更注重贴身用品的材质了吧。对我来说，最初是因为有些非棉质的卫生巾或卫生棉条会有点刺激我的皮肤，比如摩擦之类的。
[00:03:59.950] And so I naturally gravitated towards cotton. But now it's like I walk down the aisle and I'm like, dude, it's a whole aisle of multiple brands. Versus before you walk down, it's like always and then like one other brand. It's very interesting. I think I just didn't notice maybe if there was a slower transition because I wasn't purchasing stuff like that. So I feel like I just emerged from like a time capsule or something.
[00:03:59.950] 所以，我自然而然地就喜欢上了棉质衣物。但现在，我走在货架前，会惊呼：“哇，整整一排都是好几个品牌！” 而以前，货架上总是只有棉质衣物，然后才出现另一个品牌。这感觉很有意思。我想我之前可能没注意到这种转变，因为我以前没怎么买过这类东西。感觉自己就像是从时间胶囊里走出来一样。
[00:04:28.110] Dude, but also you have to buy these things now. That is true. Which is kind of lame. I've been thinking about like what is a more money friendly, I guess, sustainable way to deal with this. So one option is like the period cup, which is reusable for like a really long time. And then like you mentioned period underwear. But I've yet to really go in on one of these.
[00:04:28.110] 兄弟，但你现在就得买这些东西。确实如此。这有点儿让人郁闷。我一直在想，有没有更省钱、更可持续的解决办法。比如月经杯，可以重复使用很长时间。还有你提到的生理期内裤。但我还没真正尝试过这些东西。
[00:04:55.550] I've heard so much about the diva cup or the disc as well from people who have really enjoyed it. It's really cool because this is, like you said, such a big part of girlhood. You know, we all experience this thing because of biology and then we all have our own like tips and tricks or like things that work for us. And by us, I mean like everyone else but me because I have zero knowledge right now. And then we just like get together while we're getting ready in some bathroom and we like talk about it, you know.
[00:04:55.550] 我听很多人说过月经杯或者月经碟，他们都很喜欢。这真的很棒，就像你说的，这是女孩成长过程中非常重要的一部分。你知道，我们都会经历生理期，所以每个人都有自己的小技巧或者适合自己的方法。我说“我们”，指的是除了我以外的所有人，因为我现在对这方面一窍不通。然后我们就会在浴室里一边准备一边聊天，你知道的。
[00:05:25.690] And I was like, wow, this is like what we are destined to be. When everyone's like, oh my God, I'm on my period. And then everyone chimes in like, oh my God, me too. We're all synced. I'm like, this is womanhood. I also think this is funny because I might have mentioned this before like a long time ago on the pod. I was thinking about getting an IUD. It's easier and you don't have to have your period.
[00:05:25.690] 我当时就想，哇，这简直就是我们命中注定的结局。当大家都说“天哪，我来月经了”的时候，然后其他人也跟着附和：“天哪，我也是！”我们心有灵犀。我就想，这就是女人啊。我觉得这事儿还挺有意思的，因为我可能很久以前在播客里提过。我当时在考虑要不要上个宫内节育器。它比较方便，而且不会影响月经。
[00:05:54.570] There were a lot of benefits to it. And I would always ask my friends who had one, you included, like, oh my God, do you like it? Like, what's it like? Blah, blah, blah. Which you can only say so much because you're like, yeah, it's in there and it's good and I don't have periods. Right. But like, what's it like? We're like nothing. But in the end, I continued to chicken out and I never got an IUD.
[00:05:54.570] 它有很多好处。我总是问那些用过的朋友，包括你，天哪，你觉得怎么样？感觉如何？等等等等。但你也只能说这么多，因为你只能说，嗯，它在里面，感觉不错，而且我不会来月经。对吧？但具体感觉如何呢？我们只能说没什么感觉。但最终，我还是临阵退缩，没去上宫内节育器。
[00:06:20.990] And now 10 years later, you got yours out and I still never committed to one. You're like, I'm still thinking about it. I mean, to be honest, like I really enjoyed my IUD. I think there were just some ways that it was affecting me or how I was speculating that it was affecting me that made me want to take it out. And also, even though I'm not going to have a child now, I am preparing for it in the next handful of years. I wanted to just remember what it's like.
[00:06:20.990] 十年过去了，你取出了节育器，而我却一直没下定决心要用。你会说，我还在考虑呢。说实话，我其实挺喜欢我的节育器的。我觉得它可能在某些方面影响了我，或者说我猜测它可能影响了我，所以才想把它取出来。而且，虽然我现在不打算要孩子，但我正在为未来几年要孩子做准备。我只是想记住那种感觉。
[00:06:49.830] That's the one thing that I missed when I had my IUD. And I think it's kind of like a double-edged sword because when you don't get your period, you save on all of the money that you would be spending on a period product. You save on that like four, five days of discomfort, especially when you're like traveling and stuff. You don't have to pack any pads or anything. So honestly, there's a lot of privilege that comes with that.
[00:06:49.830] 这是我戴上宫内节育器后唯一怀念的东西。我觉得这就像一把双刃剑，因为不来月经就省下了买卫生巾的钱，也省去了四五天的不适，尤其是在旅行的时候。你不用带卫生巾之类的东西。所以说实话，这确实带来了很多便利。
[00:07:13.670] But at the same time, I forgot what it was like to have hormonal cues or like biological cues where I was like, oh, maybe I'm behaving this way because my hormones are at this stage right now. I think being able to feel those signs in your body is very important. And it's something that I was already bad at, you know, like I'm not someone who's like, oh, my body feels really weird today. And maybe I should get this checked out. My senses are pretty dulled in that way where I probably wouldn't even know.
[00:07:13.670] 但与此同时，我也忘了那种能感知荷尔蒙信号或生理信号的感觉，比如，我以前会想，哦，也许我现在这样是因为荷尔蒙水平正处于某个阶段。我觉得能够感受到身体的这些信号非常重要。而我在这方面本来就很差劲，你知道，我不是那种会说“哦，我今天感觉身体很怪异，也许我应该去检查一下”的人。我的感官在这方面已经相当迟钝了，我可能根本察觉不到。
[00:07:42.970] But I think not getting into the practice of feeling hormonal cues was making me feel like more alien in my body. I see. Just like less connected to it. So now you're like relearning your body mind connection kind of. Yeah. And actually, when I was telling my girls chat about like, guys, I want to get my first period. Any tips and tricks? You had been the one to tell me like, oh, you should download this app that kind of helps you like track the cycles and whatnot.
[00:07:42.970] 但我认为，不去练习感受荷尔蒙信号让我感觉自己像个异类，与自己的身体格格不入。我明白了。感觉和身体的联系越来越少。所以你现在就像是在重新学习身心连接。是的。其实，当我跟闺蜜们聊天，说我想来第一次月经的时候，你还跟我说过，你应该下载一个能帮你追踪月经周期的app之类的。
[00:08:08.750] So I downloaded it and I've been relearning about all the different phases in the cycle. So my favorite thing to say the last two weeks is I can't do it. Like I'm in my luteal phase because I just learned what that was. Yeah. Honestly, I only learned that recently, too, and I learned it through TikTok. Oh. But yeah, for our listeners who don't know, it's supposed to be the period of time right before your period starts.
[00:08:08.750] 所以我下载了那个应用，重新学习了月经周期的各个阶段。过去两周我最爱说的一句话就是“我做不到”。比如，我现在正处于黄体期，因为我刚知道那是什么。是啊，说实话，我也是最近才知道的，还是从TikTok上学的。哦。对了，给那些不知道的听众朋友们解释一下，黄体期指的是月经来潮前的这段时间。
[00:08:36.350] I guess that's like the middle of your cycle, right? Yeah, I think it's like the period between ovulation and then your period starting. So it's almost like a 14-day window or like 12 days or something. Yeah. And wait, actually, you might know more than me now. But from my memory during that time, your energy is lower. You might be a little crankier. And I think your hormone levels are a little lower, right? Right.
[00:08:36.350] 我猜那大概是你月经周期的中间阶段，对吧？嗯，我觉得就是排卵到月经来潮这段时间。大概是14天左右，或者12天左右吧。嗯。等等，其实你现在可能比我更了解。但就我记忆所及，那段时间你的精力会比较低，可能会有点烦躁。而且我觉得你的激素水平也会稍微低一些，对吧？对。
[00:09:03.950] And I think there's other stuff. I'm looking at the app now, and it says like you might have pain or like breast sensitivity or anxiety. And you also might have reduced sleep quality, which I was like, that's crazy because this phase is so long. It's like a majority of your hormonal cycle. Like it would have the biggest piece in like the pie chart, you know? And this whole time, we're just supposed to have like shitty sleep and high anxiety. Like that's crazy.
[00:09:03.950] 我觉得还有其他问题。我现在正在看那个应用，上面说你可能会感到疼痛、乳房敏感或者焦虑。睡眠质量也可能下降，我当时就觉得，这太离谱了，因为这个阶段这么长，几乎占据了你整个激素周期的大部分时间。就像在激素饼图里占最大块一样，你知道吗？结果在这段时间里，我们却只能忍受糟糕的睡眠和高度焦虑。这简直太荒谬了。
[00:09:31.450] Dude, this made so much sense when I first learned about it, though, because I was like, there are some times just randomly in the month where I, I don't know, have some sort of manic episode or something. Like I literally stay up all night. Yeah. And I'm like super distracted on some sort of ADHD run on my phone. And then I'm like, damn, like why was I so active at night? Why was my mind so alive? I read about the luteal phase.
[00:09:31.450] 老兄，我第一次了解黄体期的时候，觉得这解释得通极了，因为我当时就想，每个月总有那么几天，莫名其妙地，我会突然躁狂发作什么的。比如，我会整夜不睡。真的。然后我就会特别专注地玩手机，就像多动症患者一样。之后我就想，天哪，我晚上怎么这么活跃？我的大脑怎么这么活跃？后来我读了关于黄体期的资料。
[00:10:01.410] I was like, oh, maybe that's why. Honestly, yeah. I'm like starting to piece together some things. Well, I don't know. I also do this thing where I read something and I over attribute like everything that's happening in my life to that one segment that I read. So take this with a grain of salt. I've been joking around and saying like, you know, in my luteal phase, I've been like organizing. And I decluttered every room in this house, one room a day for this last week. And I'm just like my awareness or like maybe it's my anxiety or something is heightened.
[00:10:01.410] 我当时就想，哦，也许这就是原因。说实话，是的。我开始慢慢理清一些事情了。嗯，我也不知道。我还有个毛病，就是读了一些东西之后，会把生活中发生的一切都过度归因于我读到的那一段。所以，别太当真。我开玩笑说，你知道，在我的黄体期，我一直在整理东西。过去一周，我每天整理一个房间，把家里的每个房间都清理了一遍。然后我就感觉我的感知力，或者可能是我的焦虑，或者其他什么原因，都变得特别敏锐。
[00:10:32.010] So I'm trying to like understand what kind of beast comes out in each phase of this hormonal cycle. In my luteal phase, I do think I'm a little crankier and a little bit more anxious. However, I will say ovulating. That shit is amazing. Well, yeah, it's kind of lit. It's so like I feel like I took the pill on limitless or something. Yeah, I was just about to say like, how do you feel about ovulating?
[00:10:32.010] 所以我想弄明白，在这个激素周期的每个阶段，身体会呈现出什么样的状态。在黄体期，我觉得自己会变得有点暴躁，也更容易焦虑。不过，排卵期真是太棒了！嗯，感觉就像开了药一样，精力无限。对，我正想问你，你对排卵期有什么感觉？
[00:11:01.750] Because then you're like high energy and your hormone levels are higher. And sometimes I feel really productive during the ovulating period. Yeah, I just feel like I have such a positive outlook towards life when I'm ovulating. And I also feel so like beautiful. So on the app, it tells you like what day is potentially your like peak ovulation day or whatever. Right.
[00:11:01.750] 因为那时候你会精力充沛，荷尔蒙水平也高。有时候我感觉排卵期效率特别高。是啊，我感觉排卵期的时候对生活特别积极乐观。而且我也觉得自己特别漂亮。所以那个app会告诉你哪一天可能是你的排卵高峰期之类的。对。
[00:11:26.870] And, you know, the science behind it is like technically people are supposed to be able to tell just because biologically it's like you're the most fertile on that day or something like that. Right. And I was just like looking at myself in the mirror on my peak ovulation day. And I was like, yeah, I look like I'm ovulating. Oh, my God. Like you can tell. Yeah. Wait, that's super funny, though.
[00:11:26.870] 你知道，背后的科学原理是，理论上人们应该能分辨出来，因为从生物学角度来说，那天你最容易受孕之类的。对。我就在排卵高峰期照镜子，然后心想，嗯，我看起来就像在排卵。我的天哪。真的能看出来。是啊。等等，这真的太搞笑了。
[00:11:53.590] I also think it's really funny because sometimes I see on TikTok this comment trend of women commenting like, oh, my God, I'm ovulating right now. So like if someone's like really beautiful in the video or it's like a thirst trap or like, you know, something like that. And people are like, dude, I'm ovulating. I feel like it's so funny. Someone on Love Island recently said that. Oh, my God. Like as an excuse for someone who was like acting up or something.
[00:11:53.590] 我觉得这真的很有趣，因为我有时在TikTok上看到这种评论趋势，一些女性会评论说：“天哪，我现在正在排卵期。” 比如，如果视频里有人特别漂亮，或者拍了那种很性感的照片之类的，就会有人说：“老兄，我正在排卵期。” 我觉得这太搞笑了。最近《爱情岛》里也有人这么说。天哪。好像是用来为自己胡闹之类的找借口似的。
[00:12:22.030] And she was like, hey, like lay off my girl. She's ovulating right now. Bro, it's so funny. I also love that these cycles are becoming a little more normalized and like everyone's becoming a little more educated about them because I much prefer someone being like, oh, I'm like in my luteal phase. So I'm hella tired and like cranky versus oh, I'm PMSing.
[00:12:22.030] 她就说，嘿，别烦我女朋友了。她现在正在排卵期。兄弟，这太搞笑了。我也很高兴这些生理周期越来越正常化，大家也越来越了解它们，因为我更喜欢别人说，哦，我现在处于黄体期，所以特别累，脾气也比较暴躁，而不是说，哦，我经前综合症犯了。
[00:12:48.930] I think because there's a history of the way PMS was used in just like, you know, everyday talk. Sometimes people would be like, oh, are you cranky because you're PMSing? And that like low key pissed everyone off extra using these like phases has been, I feel like in a sense, almost like women reclaiming their hormonal cycle and like all of that kind of stuff.
[00:12:48.930] 我觉得是因为PMS这个词在日常对话中一直被滥用。有时候人们会说：“哦，你是不是因为PMS才这么烦躁？”这种说法其实有点让人恼火。我觉得，从某种意义上说，女性重新掌控自己的荷尔蒙周期，就像是在做类似的事情。
[00:13:15.250] Dude, you're so right, because that would be like the most maybe like a top three comment that high school boys used to make or like middle school boys where they would be like, why are you being such a bitch? Like, are you on your period or like, are you PMSing? And then I would just like fume. And I also wonder at that time that saying PMS as like a way to degrade women was like very common.
[00:13:15.250] 老兄，你说得太对了，这大概是高中男生或者初中男生最常说的三句话之一，他们会说：“你干嘛这么娘炮？是不是来例假了？还是经前综合症犯了？” 我当时就气炸了。而且我当时也觉得，用“经前综合症”来贬低女性这种说法很普遍。
[00:13:38.730] We were in school, but I was like, damn, I wonder if women who are like older enough to be like at work and stuff would also hear that from like coworkers or something. Because it was kind of just a time where people were more OK with making insensitive jokes like that. Yeah, for sure. But it was so funny because recently we grabbed some drinks with some friends and you and I were talking about the luteal phase.
[00:13:38.730] 我们当时还在上学，但我当时就想，天哪，那些年纪大到可以工作的女性会不会也听到同事说这种话。因为那时候人们似乎更习惯开这种不尊重人的玩笑。是啊，确实如此。不过最近我们和朋友小酌几杯，你和我聊起了黄体期，这事儿还挺搞笑的。
[00:14:02.750] And I thought it was so funny how like all of the guys stopped talking to each other, like leaned in and they were like, what's the luteal? We were like, let us educate you. Yeah. And I feel like it also just makes more sense now that it's like, oh, I'm more educated and aware of these phases in the cycle. I think I definitely did not know that like in high school, for example. I would not have known what ovulating was.
[00:14:02.750] 我觉得特别搞笑，所有男生都停止了交谈，凑过来问：“黄体期是什么？” 我们就说：“来，我们来给你们科普一下。” 是啊。现在想想，也觉得更有道理了，因为我对生理周期的各个阶段了解得更多了。比如，我高中的时候肯定不知道这些。我甚至都不知道什么是排卵。
[00:14:30.830] I would have thought that's like during the period time or something. Oh, yeah. I feel like truly reading and like learning more about this does help you notice things better in your body. Connect the dots. For sure. And I feel like what's been really noticeable for me, too, is recently I've been seeing content on TikTok where, you know, women who really like to go to the gym and like lift weights and want to make a lot of progress in like that area.
[00:14:30.830] 我原以为那是指生理期之类的。哦，对。我觉得认真阅读和了解更多这方面的知识确实能帮助你更好地觉察身体的变化。把这些点联系起来。当然。而且我觉得最近我在TikTok上看到一些内容，里面有些女性很喜欢去健身房举重，想在这方面取得很大的进步，这一点也让我印象深刻。
[00:15:01.290] They come out with informational content about like, oh, this is the type of stuff that you should be doing during your luteal phase. This is what you should do in other phases of the hormonal cycle. And I was like, this is so cool. It's not something that is just like a huge burden to us. You know, it's something that is just like an active part of our lives that we can work around or like maybe even build momentum on. And I thought it was just so cool to like have easy access to that kind of content now. Mm hmm. Okay, wait, I'm not going to lie.
[00:15:01.290] 他们会发布一些信息内容，比如，哦，这是你在黄体期应该做的事情，这是你在激素周期的其他阶段应该做的事情。我当时就觉得，这太棒了。这不再是给我们带来巨大负担的事情了。你知道，这就像是我们生活中积极的一部分，我们可以灵活安排，甚至可以以此为契机，不断进步。我觉得现在能这么方便地获取这类信息真是太好了。嗯哼。好吧，等等，我得承认。
[00:15:29.870] But like when I'm on my period, I use it as like the number one excuse around like my mom or like fellow girls, you know, dude, I can't. I'm like on my period right now. Everyone's like, oh, no, like don't get up. Don't you lift a finger. I think one time when I was at home, my mom was like, oh, do you want to go grocery shopping with me? And I was like, I can't. I'm on my period. And she's like, oh, you rest up. I'll go by myself.
[00:15:29.870] 但就像我来例假的时候，这几乎成了我跟妈妈或者其他女生之间最常用的借口，你知道，我说，哎呀，我不行，我现在来例假了。大家都会说，哦，不行，别起来，别动。我记得有一次我在家，我妈问我，要不要跟我一起去超市买东西？我说，不行，我来例假了。她说，哦，你好好休息，我自己去。
[00:16:01.570] Dude, it really takes me back to like in high school and you would have that PE unit where you would swim. Oh, my God. And then it would be like heaven on earth when you had your period. And you're like, oh, I don't have to do that post PE class shower. Oh, my God. Yeah. And you just like take laps around the pool with your other period havers. Dude, not to get too off topic, but isn't like I think one of my biggest annoyances with the swim period in PE was that like we just had to change in front of everyone.
[00:16:01.570] 兄弟，这真的让我想起了高中体育课，游泳课简直是天方夜谭。天哪！然后来例假的时候，游泳简直就是人间天堂。你会想，哦，不用在体育课后洗澡了。天哪！是啊！然后你就可以和其他来例假的同学一起在泳池里游来游去。兄弟，虽然有点跑题，但我觉得体育课游泳课最让我恼火的一点就是，我们得当着所有人的面换衣服。
[00:16:31.870] Oh, into our swimsuit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's true. They need to implement some changing rooms or something. I didn't feel too uncomfortable. But I do remember a lot of people would go into the bathroom. Dude, that was me. And it's like a limited resource because in the girls locker room, there's only like three or four stalls or some shit. I think, OK, we did have like those shower stalls. So sometimes people would go hide in the shower stalls to change. But I was like, dude, like I'm fine with having a swimming unit.
[00:16:31.870] 哦，换泳衣。是啊，是啊，是啊。没错。他们应该建几个更衣室什么的。我倒没觉得太不自在。但我记得很多人都会去卫生间。哥们儿，我就是其中之一。而且卫生间资源有限，因为女生更衣室里好像只有三四个隔间。我想，好吧，我们确实有淋浴间。所以有时候有人会躲在淋浴间里换衣服。但我当时想，哥们儿，有游泳池就行了。
[00:17:00.850] But can we get like better changing facilities? I was just anti-swim unit in general. I was like, there's no way we're getting into a pool in second period. And then I have to go to bio after. Oh, my God. Wait, that's so true. Right. And now we have an extra excuse. We can be like, I'm in my luteal phase. But, you know, even though now I have to deal with my luteal phase, again, the hormonal cues has been really cool.
[00:17:00.850] 但是我们能不能改善一下更衣室设施？我以前一直很反对游泳课。我当时想，第二节课我们绝对不能去游泳池。而且之后我还要去上生物课。我的天哪。等等，这说得太对了。没错。现在我们又多了一个借口。我们可以说，我正处于黄体期。不过，你知道，虽然我现在要应对黄体期，但激素变化带来的种种感觉真的很棒。
[00:17:28.980] And I think even just knowing what phase I'm in gives me so much stability because I know what phase is coming up. I can kind of track down when my period will happen and whatnot. And I can just like do future forward planning, you know. Like even for vacations, I'm like, oh, I might be on my period this one. I might be ovulating on this one. Okay. But I'm not gonna lie.
[00:17:28.980] 我觉得光是知道自己处于哪个阶段就能给我带来很多安全感，因为我知道接下来会是什么阶段。我可以大致预测一下月经什么时候来等等。我还可以提前计划未来，你知道吗？比如度假的时候，我就会想，哦，这次我可能正好来月经了。这次我可能正好排卵。好吧。但我不会撒谎。
[00:17:53.560] Sometimes it sucks because there was this one period of time where I had maybe two or three trips in the year. Somehow those trips just fell on my period days. Oh, God. And I was like, why did this happen? How did I not plan better? That's true. I guess there is always that risk. How do you feel when you travel on your period?
[00:17:53.560] 有时候真是糟透了，因为有那么一段时间，我一年可能只有两三次旅行。结果这些旅行竟然都碰巧赶上我的生理期。天哪！我当时就想，为什么会这样？我怎么就没好好计划一下呢？确实，我想这种风险总是存在的。你生理期旅行的时候感觉怎么样？
[00:18:16.120] I feel like it's not that bad, but I'm really annoyed that I have to like pack all my pads and like tampons, like whatever, all that stuff. Because then your suitcase is extra filled. Or if it's like, oh, I know it might happen during this trip, then I have to pack some just in case. And then it's like, oh, wait, but then how much do I pack? Like, what if it doesn't come till the end and I'm just like carrying this shit all over the world with me? Worst case, you could always just buy some.
[00:18:16.120] 我觉得其实也没那么糟糕，但我真的挺烦的，因为我得把卫生巾、卫生棉条之类的东西都打包好。这样一来，行李箱就塞得满满的。或者，如果我知道这次旅行可能会来月经，那我就得带一些以防万一。然后我又会想，等等，那我到底该带多少呢？万一月经没来，那我岂不是得带着这些东西到处跑？最坏的情况，反正到时候再买也不迟。
[00:18:43.700] But I do feel like everyone kind of has their comfort brand, you know? So it's always nice to have what you are comfortable with. But one funny thing is I actually leave a bunch of pads in like every single bag I own. So recently on a trip, there was like a small chance I might have my period come up towards the end.
[00:18:43.700] 但我感觉每个人都有自己习惯用的品牌，你知道吗？所以用自己觉得舒服的东西总是没错的。不过有件挺搞笑的事儿，我几乎每个包里都会放一堆卫生巾。所以最近一次旅行，我感觉自己快到目的地的时候可能会来月经。
[00:19:06.580] So I didn't pack any extra pads because I knew I had like four in my backpack and like two in my suitcase or something like that. I was like, oh, I should be able to like scavenge enough together. You're like, it'll pop up somewhere. I guess like the last thing you want to do is like suddenly get it when you're overseas, not know where to find it. And then you find out they don't have like the format that you prefer it.
[00:19:06.580] 所以我没带额外的卫生巾，因为我知道背包里有四片，行李箱里还有两片之类的。我就想，哦，应该能凑够用。你会觉得，总会在某个地方找到的。我想，最糟糕的情况莫过于到了国外突然想买卫生巾，却不知道去哪儿买。然后发现根本没有你喜欢的那种规格。
[00:19:33.020] Because I think I saw a TikTok recently where someone was looking to buy some tampons in Korea. And then they had to go to one of those big supermarkets because not a lot of the convenience stores nearby sold tampons. It was mostly like pads and stuff. And I was like, huh, I guess the culture is very different country by country too. Oh, that's true. I do feel like Asia leans more towards pads. But yeah, honestly, the stashing the pads and tampons into random bags, I think that's a good idea.
[00:19:33.020] 因为我最近在TikTok上看到一个视频，有人在韩国想买卫生棉条。结果她不得不去一家大型超市，因为附近的便利店几乎都不卖卫生棉条，大多都是卫生巾之类的。我就想，嗯，看来各国文化差异真的很大啊。哦，确实如此。我感觉亚洲人更倾向于用卫生巾。不过说真的，把卫生巾和卫生棉条随便塞进几个袋子里，我觉得这主意不错。
[00:20:00.520] It's another tip and trick that I will be writing down. I have a couple in my work bag. I have some in my travel backpack. And then I have like a packable day pack that I sometimes bring. There's like pads in there too. I actually also leave at least two or three in the car as well. Oh, in the glove compartment.
[00:20:00.520] 这是我打算记下来的另一个小窍门。我的工作包里放着几片，旅行背包里也放了一些。我还有一个可折叠的日用背包，有时候会带上，里面也放着卫生巾。实际上，我还在车里放了至少两三片，哦，对了，放在手套箱里。
[00:20:22.520] Well, there's another tip and trick that I got from you, which was that when you're scared of leaking, you just put a towel down, especially like on nights when you're sleeping on a bed or something like that. You don't want to leak. Just get rid of that risk by putting a towel down. And for my first period that I got recently, I did the trick because back then, you know, 10 years ago, I was like a power leaker. Like I was fucking leaking everywhere.
[00:20:22.520] 嗯，我还从你那里学到了一个小窍门，就是如果你害怕侧漏，就垫条毛巾，尤其是在晚上睡在床上之类的。你肯定不想侧漏。垫条毛巾就能消除这种风险。我最近第一次来月经的时候就用了这个方法，因为你知道，十年前，我简直就是个“侧漏女王”。到处都漏。
[00:20:46.540] And I was super scared because I realized that every single sitting surface in my house is white. My sofas are white. My dining chairs are white. And all my like linens for my bed are also white. That's crazy. And I was like, this is IUD privilege. Well, yeah, I felt like the craziest part of that is that all your bed sheets are white. They're like pure white too. And our duvet covers and everything.
[00:20:46.540] 我当时吓了一跳，因为我发现我家所有坐的东西都是白色的。沙发是白色的，餐椅是白色的，连床单被罩之类的也都是白色的。太疯狂了。我就想，这就是宫内节育器特权吧。嗯，我觉得最疯狂的是，你家的床单都是白色的，纯白得不能再白了。还有被套什么的。
[00:21:16.840] Oh my God. Yeah, I was just like, I guess it's something that I did because I didn't get my period. Like I forgot about that risk of potentially leaking. Dude, okay. Low key, I feel like it's not even just period leaking. But like if you ever have period sex, like you can't be doing that on what you should. Should I lay like a tarp down?
[00:21:16.840] 我的天哪。是啊，我当时就想，可能是因为我没来月经才这么做的。我好像忘了可能会漏出来。老兄，好吧。说实话，我觉得这甚至不只是经血渗漏。但是，如果你在经期做爱，就不能在不该做的时候做。我应该铺块防水布吗？
[00:21:48.800] Damn, I actually forgot about that. About the concept of that. Okay, but also, I think I might have told you this as well. I said I like sometimes just have a shitty set of sheets if it's like period time. No, honestly, all of these things make sense. And I just, you know, I have to like jog my memory. Dude, when you said you had all white sheets, duvet covers, and everything, I like looked at my bed.
[00:21:48.800] 妈的，我居然忘了这茬儿了。忘了那个概念了。好吧，不过，我觉得我可能也跟你说过。我说过，有时候来例假的时候，我就会用一套很烂的床单。不，说真的，这些都很有道理。我只是，你知道，我得想想。哥们儿，你说你用的是全白的床单、被套什么的，我看了看我的床。
[00:22:18.620] I was like, damn, I don't even own a single white sheet right now. I mean, honestly, I was just as shocked as you when I got my first period. I had to bring my towel to the sofa and then sit on my towel because I was so scared. I was like trumbling. It's okay, you'll become a pro in no time. My doctor, the one who took my IUD out, she made me say bye to my IUD. And then I was like, damn, like I don't even know what it's like to have my period anymore.
[00:22:18.620] 我当时就想，天哪，我现在连一张白床单都没有。说真的，我第一次来月经的时候也跟你一样震惊。我吓得都快要崩溃了，只好把毛巾拿到沙发上，然后坐在毛巾上。别担心，你很快就能适应的。我的医生，就是帮我取出宫内节育器的那个医生，她让我跟我的节育器说了再见。然后我就想，天哪，我都不知道来月经是什么感觉了。
[00:22:48.730] She turned to look me square in the eyes and she was like, don't worry, you'll remember. I was like, hmm, that's true. Wait, that's so funny. Was your doctor young? Yeah, youngish. Dude, off topic, but like, isn't it crazy that doctors can be younger than us now? Dude, no, I just got over the dentist thing. My last gynecologist was like super young and like high energy.
[00:22:48.730] 她转过头直视着我的眼睛，说：“别担心，你会记住的。” 我心想：“嗯，确实如此。” 等等，这太搞笑了。你的医生年轻吗？嗯，还算年轻。哥们，跑题了，不过，现在的医生比我们还年轻，这难道不疯狂吗？哥们，不，我刚从看牙医的阴影中走出来。我之前的妇科医生超级年轻，而且精力充沛。
[00:23:17.150] And I was like, I'm just getting like a pap smear. It's chill. No need to be so excited. Every year, the doctors get younger. I'm just like, damn, am I getting older? Dude, actually, so my primary care person, I've had her for a really long time. I've had her since like, I think end of high school. Last year, I think it was. I had an appointment with her and I was like, I just looked at her. I was like, oh my God.
[00:23:17.150] 我当时就想，我只是去做个宫颈抹片检查而已，没什么大不了的，不用这么激动。每年医生都越来越年轻，我就想，天哪，我这是在变老吗？说真的，我的家庭医生，我看了她很久了，大概从高中毕业就开始看她了。去年，我去她那里做检查，我看着她，心想，我的天哪。
[00:23:47.350] When I first got her, she was really young. I think she was like freshly graduated. And I looked at her like last year. I was like, oh my God, you're not that young, like fresh grad anymore. I feel like I've always had older doctors. But recently, my PCP was out on mat leave or something. So then I had to go in and see a young doctor who was also very high energy. And I was looking at her and I was like, damn, this is like a face that I would see at like one of those bars we go to or something. You know what I mean? Oh God.
[00:23:47.350] 我刚开始看她的时候，她真的很年轻。我觉得她应该是刚毕业不久。去年我看着她，心想，我的天哪，你都这么大了，不再是刚毕业的那种了。我感觉我以前的医生都比较年长。但最近，我的家庭医生休产假什么的。所以我不得不去看一位年轻的医生，她也很有活力。我看着她，心想，天哪，这张脸就像我在酒吧之类的地方会遇到的那种人。你懂我的意思吗？我的天哪。
[00:24:17.950] Like it's so weird to see you in this kind of environment. Yeah. Okay. But I do have a question. What has been maybe like the biggest single change from getting your IUD out besides like having a period? So it's kind of hard to tell like how much of this is placebo or not. And I think everyone's experience with the IUD is so different.
[00:24:17.950] 在这种环境下看到你感觉好奇怪。是啊。好的。但我有个问题。除了来月经之外，取出宫内节育器后最大的变化是什么？很难说这其中有多少是安慰剂效应，又有多少是实际感受。而且我觉得每个人使用宫内节育器的体验都截然不同。
[00:24:42.750] But for me, I think the IUD was giving me acne and also giving me a little bit of swelling. So I noticed that when I took the IUD out, a lot of my swelling went down. I can feel it in very specific parts of my body. There's like this lymph node massage that my aunt taught me to do when I was really young. From time to time, I would do it. Okay. This is like also old wife's tale. So don't fact check me.
[00:24:42.750] 但对我来说，我觉得宫内节育器让我长痘痘，还有点肿胀。所以我注意到，取出节育器后，我的肿胀消退了很多。我能感觉到身体某些特定部位的肿胀减轻了。我小时候，姑姑教过我一种淋巴结按摩的方法，我偶尔会做一下。好吧，这只是个民间偏方，所以别去查证。
[00:25:10.990] But she would say that if you press like the area right under your ears and kind of like where your jaw meets your neck, it hurts a lot if you're really bloated or maybe like your lymph nodes are swollen or something and you just have like something you need to flush out. But if you don't, it doesn't feel like anything. And it used to hurt so bad for like years. And I would like try to massage it out from time to time, but it would be so painful. And I could only do it like a little bit at a time.
[00:25:10.990] 但她说，如果你按压耳朵下方，也就是下巴和脖子交界的地方，如果感觉很胀气，或者淋巴结肿大之类的，需要排出体内积液，就会很疼。但如果不按压，就不会有任何感觉。以前那里疼了好几年。我偶尔会试着按摩一下，但真的很疼。每次只能按一点点。
[00:25:38.970] But after I took the IUD out, it doesn't hurt anymore. And I was like, unsure how factual it is, but it made a difference and I can like feel it in my body. That's good. So yeah, I think the inflammation for both acne and like the lymph node area went down a little bit. I just feel a little bit more human or something. I don't know. Well, I think any sort of change affects me like a lot. So I feel very affected by the change.
[00:25:38.970] 但是取出宫内节育器之后，就不疼了。我当时也不确定这种感觉是不是真的，但它确实有效果，我能感觉到身体的变化。这很好。所以，我觉得痤疮和淋巴结区域的炎症都消退了一些。我感觉自己好像又恢复了正常人的状态。我也不知道为什么。嗯，我觉得任何变化都会对我产生很大的影响。所以，这次的变化对我的影响非常大。
[00:26:02.590] Okay, another question is, is there any like telltale sign for you yet where you know this like certain symptom is directly related to your period? So for example, I have like a couple. One is I get really tired on my period and leading up to my period. So when it's like really hard for me to wake up in the morning, I'm like, yo, Loki, that period is coming.
[00:26:02.590] 好的，还有一个问题，你有没有什么预兆，能让你知道某个症状和月经直接相关？比如，我有几个。一个是来月经的时候，以及月经来之前，我会特别累。所以，如果早上很难起床，我就会想，哎哟，洛基，月经要来了。
[00:26:31.370] And then I think because I'm fatigued during my period, I can like eat more on my period if that makes sense. Like I feel like I could eat bigger portions. Okay, that's not good because I was in my luteal phase and I was like vacuuming up some food and I was like, maybe this is because I'm on my luteal phase and I just have a bigger appetite. No, yeah, I think I have a big appetite because I'm extra tired during that period.
[00:26:31.370] 然后我觉得，因为我来月经的时候很疲惫，所以吃得特别多，不知道这样说你能不能理解。感觉自己能吃下更多。好吧，这可不好，因为我当时正处于黄体期，感觉自己像个大胃王一样狼吞虎咽，我就想，也许是因为黄体期食欲比较旺盛吧。不，对，我觉得我食欲旺盛是因为来月经的时候特别疲惫。
[00:26:57.910] I've only had it once since I got it taken out. And I'm like two days away from my second one. But I will say that before my first one, I had like this stomach pain where it was kind of a mix of being constipated and also pre period stomach pain. I think it just felt very familiar. Despite it having been 10 years since my last period, I was like, I know this stomach pain. And then lo and behold, literally that night or maybe like the next morning or something,
[00:26:57.910] 自从取出输卵管后，我只经历过一次。再过两天就是第二次了。不过，在第一次月经来潮之前，我感觉肚子疼，有点像便秘和经前综合症的混合症状。我觉得那种感觉非常熟悉。虽然距离上次月经已经十年了，但我还是觉得，这种肚子疼我太熟悉了。然后，果不其然，就在那天晚上，或者可能是第二天早上，
[00:27:27.990] I had the, you know, period shit. And I was no longer constipated. And I was like, okay, yeah, I knew this was a familiar feeling. It's like right before you get your period. Yeah. Things are brewing. Yeah. Okay, wait, how long did you have your period before? I think I had it for like five years. Oh, okay. So you had it for a good while.
[00:27:27.990] 我来了，你知道的，就是那种来月经的便秘。而且我也不便秘了。然后我就想，好吧，我知道这种感觉很熟悉。就像来月经之前的感觉。对，感觉一切都在酝酿。对。等等，你之前来月经多久了？我想大概有五年吧。哦，好吧。所以你来月经的时间挺长的。
[00:27:57.010] Now you're just like relearning all of that. Yes, yes. Five years off for 10 years. And then now I'll have it again for another few years. Few years. What are you planning on hitting menopause? Well, I don't know. I feel like once I have a kid, I would put the IUD in again. Oh, okay. Fair. Because you don't want to accidentally pop out more kids. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:27:57.010] 现在你就像在重新学习这一切。是啊，是啊。停了五年，停了十年。然后现在我又要再用几年。几年。你打算什么时候绝经？嗯，我不知道。我觉得一旦有了孩子，我就会再放一次宫内节育器。哦，好吧。有道理。因为你不想意外地又生了几个孩子。对，对，没错。
[00:28:25.890] I'm toying with the idea. That's why I'm trying to enjoy my period. Hmm. I see. You're like, it's not going to be here forever. That's such a stark contrast from myself because sometimes on my period, I look at myself and I'm like, dude, I'm going to experience this for like 12 times for X amount of years into the future forever. I mean, honestly, though, because I've been enjoying my period,
[00:28:25.890] 我正在考虑这个想法。所以我才想好好享受我的月经。嗯，我明白了。你会想，它不会永远都在。这跟我自己的想法截然不同，因为有时候来月经的时候，我会看着自己，心想，天哪，以后这么多年，我还要经历十二次这样的事情。不过说真的，因为我一直很享受我的月经，
[00:28:56.470] I've had one period, but I've been enjoying it. I was thinking about maybe getting the copper IUD after we have our kid. That way, I'll still have my cycle and whatnot and be more in tune with it without having hormonal birth control. Right. Do you feel like having that hormonal birth control was different now that you're off of it? I think it was. I guess I'm just trying to establish my baseline again because I also don't really know what
[00:28:56.470] 我来了一次月经，但感觉还不错。我在考虑生完孩子后是不是该上个铜环。这样，我还能保持正常的月经周期，更好地适应身体的自然规律，而不用服用激素类避孕药。对。你觉得停药后，服用激素类避孕药和之前有什么不同吗？我觉得有。我想我只是想重新建立起自己的生理基础，因为我也不太清楚……
[00:29:24.870] it's like to not have hormonal birth control. And I'm just very interested in exploring like different types of birth control because again, I've really only done the pill and the hormonal IUD. And I know there's a lot of different options out there now. Do you feel like you feel scared about hormonal birth control or do you have any like opinions on hormonal versus non-hormonal? Yeah, I guess I feel like kind of scared about hormonal birth control because I'm like,
[00:29:24.870] 感觉就像没有服用激素类避孕药一样。我很想尝试不同的避孕方式，因为我之前只服用过避孕药和含激素的宫内节育器。我知道现在有很多不同的选择。你对激素类避孕药感到害怕吗？或者你对激素类和非激素类避孕药有什么看法？嗯，我猜我对激素类避孕药有点害怕，因为我觉得……
[00:29:54.870] what if the hormones make me a different person? So I did briefly do the pill for a bit. The first pill that I got, it was okay. I didn't feel like too bad on it, but I kept freaking out about the extra health risks. Like you're way more prone to blood clots and like all of that stuff. I literally had like a panic attack the first time I took a pill because I was like, dude,
[00:29:54.870] 如果激素让我变成另一个人怎么办？所以我短暂地服用过一段时间避孕药。我拿到的第一颗药感觉还行。服用后我并没有感觉太糟糕，但我一直很担心额外的健康风险。比如更容易出现血栓之类的。我第一次吃药的时候真的吓得要死，因为我当时想，天哪，
[00:30:24.650] I'm about to get a blood clot. Oh my God. You're like, it's coming. I feel it. I switched pills at one point because I moved. And so I had to get it from a different like supplier or whatever, or like a pharmacy or whatever. And that second one like fucked me up. I was getting really, really bad anxiety. I felt really uncomfortable in my body.
[00:30:24.650] 我感觉自己快要血栓了。天哪。就像，它要来了。我感觉到了。我之前因为搬家换过药。所以我得从不同的供应商或者药房之类的地方买药。第二次买的药把我搞得一团糟。我焦虑得厉害，浑身不舒服。
[00:30:48.810] It was almost like this tightness all throughout my body and it was really just not good. So then I immediately stopped and never went back. So then my fear and IUD is like in you. So like, what if you feel like shit and it's just like in you, you can't just like rip it out. You have to like go to the doctors and like get it taken out and stuff. I think honestly, like whenever the word hormonal exists and something that you have to like
[00:30:48.810] 感觉全身都紧绷绷的，非常难受。所以我立刻停用了，之后再也没用过。我的恐惧在于，宫内节育器就像在你体内一样。比如说，如果你感觉很糟糕，而它又在你体内，你不可能把它硬生生地拔出来。你必须去看医生，把它取出来之类的。说实话，我觉得只要提到“激素”这个词，或者提到某种你必须……的东西，就应该……
[00:31:15.010] take or ingest or, you know, put into your body, whether that's an IUD or implant, like it feels so scary. I feel like it's half a taboo word and half, you know, there are real changes that you'll see your body go through. So yeah, I can definitely empathize with it being scary. Like for me, I think the benefits outweighed the risks for a long time. But I know for a lot of people, there's this trial and error process that you have to do with birth control. And that's like the shittiest part. Like you can't just take one and be like, yeah, this will probably be good.
[00:31:15.010] 无论是服用、摄入还是放入体内，不管是宫内节育器还是植入式避孕器，都让人觉得很可怕。我觉得“避孕”这个词一半是禁忌，一半是身体会发生切实的变化。所以，我完全能理解那种恐惧感。对我来说，我认为避孕的益处在很长一段时间内都大于风险。但我知道对很多人来说，避孕是一个不断尝试的过程。而这恰恰是最糟糕的部分。你不能像有些人那样，随便试一种就觉得“嗯，这个应该不错”。
[00:31:44.990] You have to wait for the full cycle. And then you're like, actually, I feel like shit. And this is not just me being scared. And then you have to like flush it out again. So there's all these things that I think we have, we as women have to go through. Yeah. So in the end, I was like, you know what? Fuck it. Instead of dealing with potential change, I'm just gonna have a period. And it's been 10 years since.
[00:31:44.990] 你得等整个周期过去。然后你会觉得，真的，我感觉糟透了。这不仅仅是我害怕而已。然后你还得把它冲走。所以我觉得我们女性要经历所有这些事情。是啊。所以最后，我就想，你知道吗？去他妈的。与其应对可能的变化，我干脆就来月经吧。到现在已经十年了。
[00:32:14.720] But I feel like because of that, it's like extra, I guess like brave that you went through that change two times if you think about it. The first time was getting the IUD and like experiencing that change and period of time where you have to wait it out and like normalize and relearn yourself. And then now you're like getting off of it. It's another big change again. Yeah, I guess I was lucky that I didn't have too many adverse side effects or anything
[00:32:14.720] 但我觉得正因为如此，你才显得格外勇敢，毕竟你经历了两次这样的改变。第一次是上节育器，经历了那段适应期，需要等待一段时间才能恢复正常，重新认识自己。现在你又要停用节育器了，这又是一次巨大的改变。是啊，我觉得自己很幸运，没有出现太多不良反应。
[00:32:44.240] with the IUD. I think the funny thing about an IUD, I think to an extent when you're taking the pill, it's almost like a daily choice to like stay on the path of birth control. It's like every morning at whatever time you choose your alarm to be, you have to like pop the pill. Yeah. But for an IUD, it's like once every seven years, you know? So you really just like forget about it, I think. That's kind of the nice part. But yeah, it is exciting to be back into my hormonal cycle.
[00:32:44.240] 用了宫内节育器。我觉得宫内节育器挺有意思的，吃避孕药的时候，感觉就像每天都要主动选择避孕一样。就像每天早上你设定的闹钟时间，你都得吃药。是啊。但宫内节育器就七年才用一次，你知道吗？所以你基本上就不用管它了，我觉得。这算是它的好处吧。不过，能重新回到正常的生理周期，感觉真不错。
[00:33:12.400] I'm excited to like understand female hormonal health again and just like gear my body up for what's next to come, as scary as it is. But because you're such a veteran in the period world, do you have any other things that you like to do, whether it's like, you know, a mini ritual you might do on your periods or like ways to prepare or any other tips and tricks?
[00:33:12.400] 我很兴奋能再次了解女性荷尔蒙健康，并为即将到来的生理期做好准备，尽管这很让人害怕。但因为你是经期方面的专家，你有没有什么其他的经期习惯，比如一些小小的仪式、准备方法或其他小技巧？
[00:33:37.440] Oh, there is this one thing and I don't know if like how truly effective or whatever it is, but apparently raspberry leaf tea is pretty good for female hormonal health, specifically like reproductive health, your uterus health, I guess. Anyway, what I do is the first day or two of my period, I always drink a cup.
[00:33:37.440] 哦，还有一件事，我不知道它到底有多有效，但据说覆盆子叶茶对女性荷尔蒙健康，特别是生殖健康，比如子宫健康，很有好处。总之，我每次月经来潮的前一两天都会喝一杯。
[00:34:00.960] I also saw something like you want to have more iron because you're like technically losing blood out of your body. So on your period, you might want to increase your red meat intake or, you know, things like spinach or another like naturally high iron foods as well. Oh, yeah, so true. I feel like especially because Asians tend to have like anemia for some reason, our population is like susceptible to anemia. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:34:00.960] 我还看到有人说，经期你会流失血液，所以需要补充铁。因此，经期时可以增加红肉的摄入量，或者多吃菠菜之类的富含铁的食物。哦，对，确实如此。我觉得尤其因为亚洲人似乎更容易贫血，我们这群人好像更容易患贫血。是啊，没错。
[00:34:28.780] So I feel like we feel it extra hard on our period. Dude, maybe that's why I'm exhausted all the time. Dude, maybe honestly. My mom's always like, eat this for your period health. Damn, your mom's the true veteran. Wait, so true. Wait, but actually she might have forgotten a lot because she went through menopause a while ago. Oh. It was really funny when she did though, because during that time, I think she was just like
[00:34:28.780] 所以我觉得我们来月经的时候特别难受。哥们，可能这就是我总是这么累的原因吧。哥们，说真的，可能真是这样。我妈总是说，吃这个对月经健康有好处。我去，你妈真是个老手。等等，说得太对了。等等，不过她可能很多都忘了，因为她很久以前就绝经了。哦。她绝经的时候真的很有趣，因为那段时间，我觉得她就像……
[00:34:56.540] cleaning out her bathroom and she was like, oh, Crystal, I found all these pads. Like, do you want them? Because I don't need them anymore. I was like, damn, lucky. She graduated. She's been there, done that. This is also what I attribute to being an Asian thing because it's like what my mom tells me all the time. But she's like, oh, when you're on your period, you should avoid eating cold things.
[00:34:56.540] 她打扫浴室的时候，突然说：“哦，克丽丝塔尔，我找到好多卫生巾。你要吗？因为我用不着了。” 我当时就想，哇，真幸运。她都毕业了，什么都经历过了。我觉得这可能跟亚洲人有关，因为我妈也总是这么跟我说。她会说：“来月经的时候，最好别吃冷的东西。”
[00:35:22.360] You should eat hot things or warm things. It has to do with all that chi and the Chinese medicine kind of thing where it's like, if you have cold energy in your stomach because it's so close to your reproductive organs, like your uterus and all of that, that cold energy will cause you to cramp more and be in more pain. So I just, I try to avoid ice cold food and or drinks.
[00:35:22.360] 你应该吃些热的或温热的食物。这跟气血运行以及中医理论有关，比如，如果你的胃部能量偏寒，因为它离你的生殖器官（比如子宫等等）很近，那么这种寒气就会导致你更严重的痉挛和疼痛。所以我尽量避免吃冰冷的食物或饮料。
[00:35:52.660] And I feel like it does help maybe, or maybe it's placebo. And I was always confused about this because in like Western media, everyone on their period eats a tub of ice cream. Right. You're so right, actually. Yeah. You're like, nope, that's bad for the energy. I feel like the only common thread that I've seen, actually, do Asians eat chocolate on their period in like Asian media? Oh, I actually don't know about that.
[00:35:52.660] 我觉得这可能确实有点帮助，也可能只是安慰剂效应。我一直很困惑，因为在西方媒体里，好像每个人来月经的时候都会吃一大桶冰淇淋。对啊，你说得太对了。是啊，你会想，不行，那样对精力不好。我感觉我唯一看到的共同点，就是亚洲媒体里，亚洲女性来月经的时候会吃巧克力吗？哦，我其实不太清楚。
[00:36:21.520] But I have heard that chocolate is good for you on your period. And I feel like it's always like the common trope of, oh, girlfriend on her period. So the guy shows up with ice cream and like a chocolate bar or something. Yeah. Now I'm like, what do the Asians eat? Dude, maybe they should be showing up with like beef jerky and like chocolate. Babe, I heard you're on your period. So I brought a whole bag of spinach. Or like I made us this like giant steak for dinner tonight.
[00:36:21.520] 但我听说巧克力对生理期有好处。而且我觉得这总是老套的桥段，比如，女朋友来例假了，然后男的就带冰淇淋、巧克力之类的东西来安慰她。是啊。我就想，亚洲人都吃什么呢？哥们儿，他们或许应该带牛肉干和巧克力之类的。宝贝，听说你来例假了，所以我带了一整袋菠菜。或者，我今晚给我们做了个超大的牛排。
[00:36:52.000] We have to change some of the tropes in media with the more factually based things. Well, before we wrap up this episode, I have a final question for you. How would you describe your relationship with your period? Oh, it's just like there. Actually, I think this ties in well with what a period is colloquially called in Chinese, in Mandarin specifically.
[00:36:52.000] 我们必须用更基于事实的内容来改变媒体中的一些老套说法。好了，在结束这期节目之前，我还有一个问题。你会如何描述你和月经的关系？哦，就像那里一样。实际上，我认为这和中文，特别是普通话中对月经的俗称很吻合。
[00:37:22.300] My mom taught me and I think there's actually like a ton of different ways to say this. But the two main ways that I say it with my mom is, oh, that thing is here. And then the second way is like our oldest aunt is visiting. Oh, that's so cute. That thing is so like so much less friendly than, oh, our oldest aunt. Yeah.
[00:37:22.300] 我妈教过我，我觉得其实有很多种说法。但我跟我妈说的时候主要有两种说法：一种是“哦，那东西来了”。另一种是“我们最年长的姑妈来访了”。哦，真可爱。“那东西”听起来比“哦，我们最年长的姑妈”要冷淡得多。是啊。
[00:37:47.580] So I think that thing is like maybe like the more accurate direct translation is it's almost like that task is here. Oh. So the Chinese phrase is like, 来事了。 And 是, or like I say it like 是, but 事情, it can be like translated as tasks sometimes in a work environment. Or it can be like something you need to deal with or like something you need to do. Yeah.
[00:37:47.580] 所以我觉得，更准确的直接翻译可能是，它几乎就像是“这件事来了”。哦，中文短语是“来事了”。而“是”，或者像我说的“是”，但“事情”有时可以翻译成工作环境中的任务。或者它可以指你需要处理的事情，或者你需要做的事情。是的。
[00:38:16.760] I guess in my head, it's kind of like, oh, that thing is here. You know, the thing we have to deal with. Yeah. I see. So it's like a monthly task, a monthly obligation. Yeah. Kind of. It's like just like some part of life that comes every month. It's like pros and cons kind of because how I mentioned, I'll use it as an excuse sometimes. Yeah. It's a pretty universal excuse. You know, sometimes I'm like, dude, I don't want to hang out because I'm on my period.
[00:38:16.760] 我觉得，在我脑子里，就好像是，哦，这事儿来了。你知道，就是我们得应付的事儿。嗯，我明白了。所以它就像每月一次的任务，每月一次的义务。对，差不多吧。就像生活中每个月都会发生的一部分。有利有弊，就像我刚才说的，有时候我会拿它当借口。嗯，这算是个很通用的借口。你知道，有时候我会说，哥们儿，我不想出去玩，因为我来例假了。
[00:38:43.920] Or like, mom, you can't make me do chores because I'm on my period. Oh, I shouldn't work out because, you know, today's heaviest flow or something like that. True. And who can blame you for that? Exactly. So I feel like it's a good excuse, but it's also definitely something that you're just like, oh, I have to like power through this. For the next, the worst few days. So the other phrase that you refer to in Mandarin. Yeah.
[00:38:43.920] 或者比如，妈妈，你不能因为我来例假就逼我做家务。哦，我今天经量特别大，所以不应该锻炼。没错。谁又能责怪你呢？正是如此。所以我觉得这确实是个不错的借口，但你也肯定会想，哦，我必须硬撑过去。接下来的几天会很难熬。所以你提到的那个普通话说法。是的。
[00:39:12.860] Called your period your oldest aunt. So do you ever feel like you feel that side of the period as well? Like you feel like an old family member, like an old friend coming to town. Okay. But I think the implication for that one is not necessarily that it's a friend visiting. I think it's like, oh, like the like in-laws are in or like grandma's visit or, you know, like that one aunt is here.
[00:39:12.860] 你把月经叫做你最老的姑妈。所以你有没有过这种感觉？感觉像个老亲戚，像个老朋友来城里探望？好吧。但我认为这种感觉并不一定是指朋友来访。我觉得更像是，哦，就像公婆来了，或者奶奶来访，或者，你知道，就像某个姑妈来了。
[00:39:43.310] And it's like, of course, it's not like the worst thing ever, but it's like, oh, I have to like do some extra steps to like host this visiting person. Dude, something about personifying your period is hilarious. Like someone coming to town to visit or something. You're like, oh, let me clean the house. Yeah. Clean the bathroom for you. Let me do all my tasks now. So when I'm on my period, I can just lie on the couch. True.
[00:39:43.310] 当然，这也不是什么天大的事，但感觉就像，哦，我得额外做些准备来招待这位客人。老兄，把月经拟人化真的太搞笑了。就像有人来城里拜访一样。你会想，哦，让我来打扫房子吧。对啊。帮你打扫卫生间。让我现在就把所有家务都做完。这样我来月经的时候，就可以直接躺在沙发上了。真的。
[00:40:13.950] Yeah. Well, I think my relationship with my period is like an old friend who I haven't seen in a long time. And we're starting our relationship anew, but I am still excited for her to visit on a monthly basis. Okay. Wait, actually, I have another question for you. Yeah. You having your period now, does that mean James has more responsibility now too? Oh, I don't know.
[00:40:13.950] 是啊。嗯，我觉得我和月经的关系就像一位很久没见的老朋友。我们现在重新开始建立关系，但我还是很期待她每个月的到来。好的。等等，其实我还有个问题想问你。嗯。你现在来月经了，是不是意味着詹姆斯也得承担更多责任了？哦，我不知道。
[00:40:40.070] He has to step up and take care of you on your period, help out a little extra during those like tougher days. Honestly, yeah. It's definitely a good excuse not to cook, I think. Yeah. Like he needs to show up with beef jerky and chocolate. Right. You know, I'll have him listen to this episode. Like here's my new life now. I always employ my boyfriend to like go out and buy pads for me. Oh. Oh.
[00:40:40.070] 他得主动承担起照顾你生理期的责任，在你比较难熬的日子里多帮帮忙。说真的，没错。我觉得这绝对是个不做饭的好借口。对啊。他得带牛肉干和巧克力来才行。对。你知道吗，我会让他听这期节目。就像我现在这样。我总是让我男朋友出去帮我买卫生巾。哦。哦。
[00:41:09.030] I mean, only when he can or when it's convenient. I made him memorize like the brand I get. Made him look at like what type. Because, you know, there's like a bunch like overnight, regular and like liners, all of that stuff. Sometimes he has to go look for my pads for me. And I always think about it. I'm like, damn, when guys buy pads, I feel like low key, it's like a flex almost. Or like a badge of honor. Yeah.
[00:41:09.030] 我的意思是，只有在他有空或者方便的时候才会帮他。我让他记住我用的牌子，还让他看看是什么类型的。因为你知道，有很多种，比如夜用型、普通型、护垫之类的。有时候他得帮我去找护垫。我总是会想，天哪，男生买护垫，感觉就像是在炫耀，或者说是一种荣誉勋章。是啊。
[00:41:38.370] No one's gonna shit on them for buying pads. They're like, oh, what? Like a sweet boyfriend. True, true. Yeah. Especially if he grabs like some chocolate on the way out. And they're like, oh, look at him. Such an angel. Yeah. But then when a girl buys pads, it's like, oh, damn, she's about to have her period. We all like shake our heads in solidarity. Yeah. Like poor thing. So I guess James should prepare, you know, learn some of your period products. Yeah. We're learning together.
[00:41:38.370] 没人会因为他们买卫生巾而嘲笑他们。他们会说，哦，什么？就像个贴心的男朋友。没错，没错。是啊。尤其如果他出门的时候还顺便买了点巧克力。他们就会说，哦，看看他。真是个天使。是啊。但如果女生买卫生巾，大家就会说，哦，天哪，她快来月经了。我们都会感同身受地摇头。是啊。就像可怜的姑娘。所以我觉得詹姆斯应该做好准备，了解一下经期用品。是啊。我们一起学习。
[00:42:06.610] But because I have fucking like 200 of everything, I guess he'll learn next year. He's like, how does that brand feel versus that brand? Let me know. I'm like, I don't know. Dude, they should make like sampler packs. Wait, that would be kind of nice. Yeah. Right? Because like buying one pack sometimes is a big commitment.
[00:42:06.610] 但因为我每样东西都囤了大概200个，估计他明年就能学会了。他会问我，这个牌子和那个牌子哪个感觉好？告诉我一声。我说，我不知道。哥们儿，他们应该出个试用装。等等，那好像还不错。是啊，对吧？因为有时候买一包感觉挺大的。
[00:42:29.910] One full pack of pads is going to probably last you like one to two periods at least. Right. And then you're just all in. Like what if you didn't like it? Yeah. You didn't like the first one. And now you have a whole pack of like 30 still. And you're down like $20 or whatever. Yeah. They need to make some like discovery packs for pads. Wait, that's so right. It should just be seven. Seven different brands.
[00:42:29.910] 一整包卫生巾大概至少能用一到两次月经。没错。然后你就全买了。万一你不喜欢呢？是啊。你不喜欢第一包。现在你还剩一整包30片的。而且你还损失了20美元左右。是啊。他们应该推出卫生巾体验装。等等，说得太对了。应该只有七种。七个不同的品牌。
