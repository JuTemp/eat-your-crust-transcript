[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_03]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_03]：大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:03.380] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Crystal.
[00:00:03.380] [SPEAKER_00]：我是克丽丝塔尔。
[00:00:15.420] [SPEAKER_03]: So today we have a pretty interesting topic, which is job limbo. But before we dive into that,
[00:00:15.420] [SPEAKER_03]：今天我们要讨论一个非常有趣的话题，那就是就业困境。但在深入探讨之前，
[00:00:22.840] [SPEAKER_03]: Crystal, what is our Gen Z word of the day?
[00:00:22.840] [SPEAKER_03]：Crystal，我们今天的Z世代关键词是什么？
[00:00:25.780] [SPEAKER_00]: All right, today's word slash phrase is one that I like. I have no explanation why,
[00:00:25.780] [SPEAKER_00]：好的，今天我要学的这个词/短语我很喜欢。我也不知道为什么。
[00:00:31.220] [SPEAKER_00]: but I just love this phrase. It's catching strays. It just makes so much sense when you
[00:00:31.220] [SPEAKER_00]：但我就是喜欢这个短语。它就像是捕捉迷途羔羊。当你……的时候，它就显得格外有意义了。
[00:00:37.100] [SPEAKER_00]: see it in context. And I think it just adds another layer of funniness to whatever is happening.
[00:00:37.100] [SPEAKER_00]：要结合上下文来看。我觉得这只会给正在发生的事情增添另一层滑稽感。
[00:00:43.500] [SPEAKER_00]: So basically what catching strays means is you're getting unintentionally insulted when you aren't
[00:00:43.500] [SPEAKER_00]：所以，所谓“误伤他人”的意思就是，你无意中受到了侮辱，而你并没有真正想侮辱别人。
[00:00:49.800] [SPEAKER_00]: even the main topic. An example could be like, you and I are talking and I'm like,
[00:00:49.800] [SPEAKER_00]：甚至包括主要话题。例如，你我正在聊天，然后我说，
[00:00:55.700] [SPEAKER_00]: oh, don't worry, Jeesoo. You're great at this game. Unlike so and so.
[00:00:55.700] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，别担心，Jeesoo。你玩这个游戏很厉害。不像某某。
[00:01:01.080] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, that third person is just catching strays.
[00:01:01.080] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，第三个人只是在抓流浪狗而已。
[00:01:03.980] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I love this one as well. And I feel like it's a really easy one to use because this happens
[00:01:03.980] [SPEAKER_03]：兄弟，我也很喜欢这个。而且我觉得它用起来真的很容易，因为这种情况经常发生。
[00:01:08.920] [SPEAKER_03]: a lot actually in real life. And I also like to think of this as collateral damage. It's like the
[00:01:08.920] [SPEAKER_03]：实际上在现实生活中很多。而且我也喜欢把这看作是附带损害。就像……
[00:01:15.020] [SPEAKER_03]: damage is intended for one person, but someone else who sometimes isn't even in the room is
[00:01:15.020] [SPEAKER_03]：伤害原本是针对一个人的，但有时也会波及到另一个人，即使他/她不在房间里。
[00:01:20.400] [SPEAKER_03]: taking the damage as well. It's like AOE damage. Oh my god. Okay, I'm trying to find some examples
[00:01:20.400] [SPEAKER_03]：我也受到了伤害。就像范围伤害一样。我的天。好吧，我正在找一些例子。
[00:01:27.940] [SPEAKER_00]: on Know Your Meme. And here's a funny one. It's basketball related, but I think you can still
[00:01:27.940] [SPEAKER_00]：来自 Know Your Meme。这里有个搞笑的例子。虽然跟篮球有关，但我认为你仍然可以理解。
[00:01:33.200] [SPEAKER_00]: kind of get the gist. This one basketball media guy, he tweets, Blakers acquire second round pick.
[00:01:33.200] [SPEAKER_00]：大概明白了。有个篮球媒体人发推说，开拓者队获得了一个二轮选秀权。
[00:01:39.880] [SPEAKER_00]: Take Michigan State's Max Christie, who shot only 32% from three last season.
[00:01:39.880] [SPEAKER_00]：以密歇根州立大学的马克斯·克里斯蒂为例，他上赛季的三分球命中率只有 32%。
[00:01:45.680] [SPEAKER_00]: Perfect. He'll fit right in with LeBron and Westbrook.
[00:01:45.680] [SPEAKER_00]：完美。他肯定能和勒布朗、威斯布鲁克完美融合。
[00:01:51.320] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that one is like a triple wombo combo right there.
[00:01:51.320] [SPEAKER_03]：我的天哪，那简直就是三连击啊。
[00:01:55.020] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah. I see this a lot on reality TV subreddits too. Someone will be like, oh my god,
[00:01:55.020] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊。我在真人秀相关的Reddit子版块上也经常看到这种情况。有人会说，我的天哪，
[00:02:00.900] [SPEAKER_03]: this guy is so horrible, but at least he's not as bad as this guy. And it's just like a random
[00:02:00.900] [SPEAKER_03]：这家伙真是太糟糕了，但至少他没这个人那么坏。而且这就像一个随机事件
[00:02:05.300] [SPEAKER_00]: add-on person. Yeah. And I think it's also really funny when it's more subtle too.
[00:02:05.300] [SPEAKER_00]：加个角色。是啊。而且我觉得，如果处理得更含蓄一些，也很有趣。
[00:02:11.060] [SPEAKER_00]: And then someone's like, wait, hold up. This person is just fucking catching strays.
[00:02:11.060] [SPEAKER_00]：然后有人说，等等，等等。这个人只是在抓流浪狗而已。
[00:02:15.360] [SPEAKER_00]: There's another funny example on Know Your Meme. I don't even know who this guy is,
[00:02:15.360] [SPEAKER_00]：Know Your Meme 上还有另一个有趣的例子。我甚至不知道这个人是谁。
[00:02:19.760] [SPEAKER_00]: but the original tweet is, again, I ask when are we going to start slut shaming common?
[00:02:19.760] [SPEAKER_00]：但是原推文是，我再次问，我们什么时候才能开始普遍地羞辱荡妇？
[00:02:25.600] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a bunch of pictures of this common dude with like a bunch of different
[00:02:25.600] [SPEAKER_00]：然后还有一堆照片，照片里这个普通人跟很多不同的东西在一起。
[00:02:29.760] [SPEAKER_00]: women. And then on the bottom right, there's a picture of him with Elmo.
[00:02:29.760] [SPEAKER_00]：女性。然后在右下角，有一张他和艾尔莫的合影。
[00:02:34.160] [SPEAKER_00]: And then the reply is like, how did Elmo catch a stray?
[00:02:34.160] [SPEAKER_00]：然后回答是，艾尔莫是怎么抓到流浪猫的？
[00:02:38.260] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'm dead. You know, honestly, maybe this term is birthed out of people wanting to be
[00:02:38.260] [SPEAKER_03]：等等，我死了。说真的，也许这个词的由来是因为人们想要……
[00:02:48.580] [SPEAKER_03]: inclusive. We're just trying to include everyone. And this one works really well in person too.
[00:02:48.580] [SPEAKER_03]：包容性。我们只是想让每个人都参与进来。而且这种方式在面对面交流中也效果很好。
[00:02:53.600] [SPEAKER_03]: Say you're having a conversation and you're like roasting your friend, but your other friend is
[00:02:53.600] [SPEAKER_03]：假设你在和朋友聊天，你正在损你的一个朋友，但你的另一个朋友……
[00:02:56.860] [SPEAKER_03]: nearby and you want to loop them into the conversation. You just toss them astray.
[00:02:56.860] [SPEAKER_03]：就在附近，你想把他们也拉进对话里。你却把他们扔到一边。
[00:03:00.820] [SPEAKER_00]: And now they're all insulted together. Probably the funniest is when like someone
[00:03:00.820] [SPEAKER_00]：现在他们都一起被侮辱了。最搞笑的可能是当有人说“某人”的时候。
[00:03:06.640] [SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even realize that they accidentally insulted someone else in the midst of, you know,
[00:03:06.640] [SPEAKER_00]：甚至没有意识到自己在谈话中无意间冒犯了别人，你知道的，
[00:03:11.720] [SPEAKER_00]: the whole conversation. And then people are just like, wait, what the fuck? Why are these people
[00:03:11.720] [SPEAKER_00]：整个对话。然后人们就想，等等，这他妈什么鬼？这些人为什么会这样？
[00:03:15.280] [SPEAKER_00]: just catching strays? Oh man. Yeah, this is a good one. And I feel like this one will
[00:03:15.280] [SPEAKER_00]：只是抓些流浪狗？哦，天哪。是啊，这招不错。我觉得这招会
[00:03:21.440] [SPEAKER_03]: live for a very long time because I remember this came out a couple of years ago. So it's not like
[00:03:21.440] [SPEAKER_03]：能活很久，因为我记得这首歌是几年前出的。所以它不像……
[00:03:26.960] [SPEAKER_03]: the newest slang phrase or anything. So it speaks to its longevity a little bit. Oh my God. I thought
[00:03:26.960] [SPEAKER_03]：最新的俚语之类的。所以这多少能说明它的持久性。我的天哪。我以为
[00:03:33.240] [SPEAKER_00]: a good one. Yeah. If I were to say something like, oh yeah, Jisoo, you're not that short. Like you're
[00:03:33.240] [SPEAKER_00]：说得好。是啊。如果我说，哦，Jisoo，你其实没那么矮。就像你
[00:03:38.920] [SPEAKER_00]: not as short as our other friend who's only 5'2". They're like, wait, what the fuck? I didn't even
[00:03:38.920] [SPEAKER_00]：没我们另一个朋友那么矮，他只有1米57。他们就懵了，等等，什么鬼？我甚至都没……
[00:03:44.640] [SPEAKER_00]: say anything. That would be for sure catching strays. True. Well, catching strays aside,
[00:03:44.640] [SPEAKER_00]：随便说点什么。那肯定是在抓流浪狗。没错。好吧，先不说抓流浪狗的事，
[00:03:52.520] [SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the topic at hand, which is, as you mentioned, feeling job limbo. So
[00:03:52.520] [SPEAKER_00]：我们来谈谈眼下的话题，正如你提到的，就是工作不平衡的感觉。
[00:03:58.720] [SPEAKER_00]: to start this off, let's try to define what exactly job limbo is to us or how we perceive it.
[00:03:58.720] [SPEAKER_00]：首先，让我们试着定义一下工作困境对我们来说究竟是什么，或者我们是如何看待它的。
[00:04:05.240] [SPEAKER_03]: So I think you can kind of get a sense of what this phrase means just by looking at the word
[00:04:05.240] [SPEAKER_03]：所以我觉得你只要看看这个词，就能大概明白这句话的意思了。
[00:04:11.320] [SPEAKER_03]: limbo. I have felt job limbo at times where I might feel stuck in my position, maybe stuck
[00:04:11.320] [SPEAKER_03]：进退两难。我有时会感到工作上的进退两难，感觉自己被困在目前的职位上，或许是停滞不前。
[00:04:18.840] [SPEAKER_03]: at the company or just in general. I feel like there's no progress even forwards or backwards.
[00:04:18.840] [SPEAKER_03]：无论是在公司还是在其他方面，我都感觉没有任何进展，无论是前进还是后退。
[00:04:25.340] [SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think this is always just an external thing. So I don't think it's always
[00:04:25.340] [SPEAKER_03]：而且我认为这并不总是外部因素造成的。所以，我不认为它总是
[00:04:30.840] [SPEAKER_03]: about the company or the team. Sometimes I found that I experienced this on an internal level as
[00:04:30.840] [SPEAKER_03]：关于公司或团队。有时我发现，我在内部层面也会经历这种情况，
[00:04:36.580] [SPEAKER_03]: well, but just in general feeling stuck somehow, some way. Yeah. I think I would agree with that,
[00:04:36.580] [SPEAKER_03]：嗯，但总的来说，感觉好像被困住了，不知怎么的。是的。我想我同意这一点。
[00:04:44.080] [SPEAKER_00]: especially if you just feel like you are stagnant in growth or learning even, like it almost feels
[00:04:44.080] [SPEAKER_00]：尤其是当你感觉自己在成长或学习方面停滞不前时，感觉就像……
[00:04:49.840] [SPEAKER_00]: you have plateaued and there hasn't been as many new experiences or worthwhile experiences, I guess.
[00:04:49.840] [SPEAKER_00]：我想，你已经停滞不前了，没有太多新的体验或有价值的体验。
[00:04:57.680] [SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that every day has to be some crazy new thing happening, but I think once you start
[00:04:57.680] [SPEAKER_00]：并不是说每天都必须发生什么疯狂的新事，但我觉得一旦你开始
[00:05:02.900] [SPEAKER_00]: to feel really like, oh, I can just autopilot at work, that's probably a sign. Yeah, I can
[00:05:02.900] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉自己真的可以在工作中完全自动驾驶，这可能是一个信号。是的，我可以。
[00:05:08.000] [SPEAKER_03]: definitely resonate with that. The other times that I found that I felt job limbo is if maybe
[00:05:08.000] [SPEAKER_03]：我完全同意。我感觉自己其他时候也处于工作困境，可能是因为……
[00:05:14.460] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling insecurity in some way. So sometimes you might still feel like you're growing or
[00:05:14.460] [SPEAKER_03]：我感觉有些不安全。所以有时候你可能仍然觉得自己在成长，或者
[00:05:20.840] [SPEAKER_03]: learning, but if there's changes going on at the company or on your team, or even recently,
[00:05:20.840] [SPEAKER_03]：学习，但如果公司或你的团队，甚至是最近，发生了一些变化，
[00:05:27.300] [SPEAKER_03]: there's been a lot of layoffs at a lot of tech companies as well. I feel like anytime that
[00:05:27.300] [SPEAKER_03]：很多科技公司也进行了大规模裁员。我觉得任何时候……
[00:05:32.320] [SPEAKER_03]: happens, you start to feel a little bit unstable in a sense. Feeling that kind of instability,
[00:05:32.320] [SPEAKER_03]：这种情况发生时，你会开始感到某种程度上的不稳定。感受到那种不稳定感，
[00:05:38.540] [SPEAKER_03]: whether it's in your motivation or your drive or your growth, I think always kind of leads you to
[00:05:38.540] [SPEAKER_03]：无论是你的动力、干劲还是成长，我认为最终都会引导你走向……
[00:05:44.220] [SPEAKER_00]: this state of limbo. Oh, that's true. When you're kind of like, oh God, am I about to get laid off
[00:05:44.220] [SPEAKER_00]：这种进退两难的状态。哦，确实如此。当你心里想着，天哪，我是不是要被裁员了？
[00:05:49.860] [SPEAKER_00]: or am I safe? And that's such a terrible feeling. I remember back in the earlier waves of layoffs
[00:05:49.860] [SPEAKER_00]：或者我安全了吗？这种感觉太糟糕了。我还记得之前那几波裁员的时候……
[00:05:57.760] [SPEAKER_00]: when there were all those leaks. And I remember the general sentiment of these people after
[00:05:57.760] [SPEAKER_00]：当时发生了那么多泄密事件。我还记得这些人之后的普遍感受。
[00:06:02.800] [SPEAKER_00]: hearing like, oh, this company might lay off X amount of people by next week or two weeks from
[00:06:02.800] [SPEAKER_00]：听说，哦，这家公司可能在下周或下两周内裁掉 X 个人。
[00:06:08.100] [SPEAKER_00]: now. And people are just like, oh my God, what do I do? What if I'm one of those people who are
[00:06:08.100] [SPEAKER_00]：现在。人们会想，我的天哪，我该怎么办？如果我是那些人中的一员怎么办？
[00:06:12.780] [SPEAKER_00]: going to get laid off? What did the next two weeks mean to me? Right. And I guess that's the thing too.
[00:06:12.780] [SPEAKER_00]：要被裁员了吗？接下来的两周对我来说意味着什么？没错。我想这就是问题的关键所在。
[00:06:19.340] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like limbo is oftentimes something that we feel because we're maybe waiting for something
[00:06:19.340] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉就像身处炼狱，我们常常是因为在等待什么而感到迷茫。
[00:06:25.920] [SPEAKER_03]: and for something like waiting for a potential layoff announcement or maybe sensing some sort
[00:06:25.920] [SPEAKER_03]：比如等待可能的裁员公告，或者预感到某种情况
[00:06:31.740] [SPEAKER_03]: of instability. And these are things that don't have a true end date. So then I feel like that
[00:06:31.740] [SPEAKER_03]：不稳定。而且这些事情没有真正的结束日期。所以我感觉……
[00:06:36.420] [SPEAKER_03]: can also really add to the limbo feeling of I'm waiting for something, but like when and why am I
[00:06:36.420] [SPEAKER_03]：这也能加剧那种等待的迷茫感，就像我在等待某件事，但不知道是什么时候，也不知道为什么。
[00:06:43.200] [SPEAKER_00]: still waiting around? Yeah. It's almost like decision paralysis. You're like, I don't know what
[00:06:43.200] [SPEAKER_00]：还在等吗？是啊。简直就像决策瘫痪了一样。你会想，我不知道该怎么做。
[00:06:48.360] [SPEAKER_00]: to do now. And then I think that definitely lowers motivation. It definitely lowers morale,
[00:06:48.360] [SPEAKER_00]：现在就去做。我认为这肯定会降低积极性，肯定会打击士气。
[00:06:55.580] [SPEAKER_00]: which is probably one of the bigger things that honestly keep us going at work. Definitely.
[00:06:55.580] [SPEAKER_00]：这大概是我们工作中真正坚持下去的动力之一。绝对是。
[00:07:01.080] [SPEAKER_03]: This is also something that I think about sometimes. I'm like, I wonder how obvious it is
[00:07:01.080] [SPEAKER_03]：这也是我有时思考的问题。我会想，这到底有多明显？
[00:07:05.320] [SPEAKER_03]: to your manager or your teammates or even like cross-functional partners, how much someone is
[00:07:05.320] [SPEAKER_03]：对于你的经理、队友，甚至是跨部门合作伙伴来说，一个人有多……
[00:07:10.660] [SPEAKER_03]: kind of feeling this job limbo. Because I have definitely seen signs of it in like coworkers
[00:07:10.660] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉自己有点儿工作不平衡。因为我确实在同事身上看到了这种迹象。
[00:07:16.480] [SPEAKER_03]: sometimes. And I'm sure when I was really going through it, my coworkers have seen it in me as well.
[00:07:16.480] [SPEAKER_03]：有时候是这样。而且我确信，当我真正经历那种痛苦的时候，我的同事们也都察觉到了。
[00:07:22.140] [SPEAKER_03]: As much as it would be nice to like keep it contained, I do feel like there is a little bit
[00:07:22.140] [SPEAKER_03]：虽然我很想把它控制住，但我感觉还是有点……
[00:07:27.000] [SPEAKER_00]: of an external aspect to this as well. That's true. It's kind of like the people who have, you know,
[00:07:27.000] [SPEAKER_00]：这也涉及到外部因素。没错。这有点像那些拥有……的人，你知道，
[00:07:32.520] [SPEAKER_00]: already put in their two weeks notice and you can tell in the next two weeks, they're just chilling.
[00:07:32.520] [SPEAKER_00]：他们已经递交了两周的离职通知，你可以看出接下来的两周，他们只是在放松休息。
[00:07:37.200] [SPEAKER_00]: And like, you don't want to bother them either because you're like, oh, well, they're going to
[00:07:37.200] [SPEAKER_00]：而且，你也不想打扰他们，因为你会想，哦，好吧，他们要……
[00:07:40.260] [SPEAKER_00]: be gone anyway. So there's no point in, you know, piling some work on them right before they leave.
[00:07:40.260] [SPEAKER_00]：反正他们都要走了。所以，你知道，在他们离开前给他们安排一堆工作是没有意义的。
[00:07:45.580] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. It's just like everyone knows that this person is like half checked out.
[00:07:45.580] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。感觉大家都知道这个人心不在焉的。
[00:07:50.300] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, yeah. But I do have a question for you because I feel like some of the things that
[00:07:50.300] [SPEAKER_03]：兄弟，是啊。但我有个问题想问你，因为我觉得有些事情……
[00:07:54.140] [SPEAKER_03]: we talked about, like the factors that lead to job limbo or make us feel job limbo are similar
[00:07:54.140] [SPEAKER_03]：我们讨论过，导致工作困境或让我们感到工作困境的因素是类似的。
[00:08:00.120] [SPEAKER_03]: to things that cause burnout. So do you think there's like a difference between job limbo and
[00:08:00.120] [SPEAKER_03]：导致职业倦怠的事情。所以你认为工作停滞和……之间有什么区别吗？
[00:08:04.940] [SPEAKER_00]: burnout? I think yes, but I think at the same time there's definitely an overlap because I think if
[00:08:04.940] [SPEAKER_00]：倦怠？我认为是的，但同时我认为两者之间肯定存在重叠，因为我认为如果
[00:08:10.640] [SPEAKER_00]: you're constantly burnt out at work, you kind of enter some sort of job limbo. And I don't know
[00:08:10.640] [SPEAKER_00]：你在工作中总是筋疲力尽，感觉自己陷入了一种职业困境。我不知道
[00:08:17.640] [SPEAKER_00]: what you're waiting for. Maybe you're waiting for like a break or like a vacation, but you know,
[00:08:17.640] [SPEAKER_00]：你在等什么？也许你在等休息或者度假，但你知道，
[00:08:23.020] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's just like inconvenient timing or maybe you don't want to just take a random day off.
[00:08:23.020] [SPEAKER_00]：也许只是时间不合适，或者你不想随便请一天假。
[00:08:29.020] [SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's definitely overlap there because burnout also eats at your motivation
[00:08:29.020] [SPEAKER_00]：但我认为这两者之间肯定有重叠之处，因为倦怠也会削弱你的动力。
[00:08:34.820] [SPEAKER_00]: and morale. And sometimes burnout can be caused by maybe like work that you are realizing you don't
[00:08:34.820] [SPEAKER_00]：还有士气。有时候，倦怠可能是因为你意识到自己无法胜任某些工作。
[00:08:41.640] [SPEAKER_03]: actually want to do. Yeah, I feel like like you said, these two things are definitely linked
[00:08:41.640] [SPEAKER_03]：其实我想这么做。是的，我觉得就像你说的，这两件事肯定是有联系的。
[00:08:48.480] [SPEAKER_03]: and maybe job limbo is kind of a form of long term burnout. How long can you sustain burnout
[00:08:48.480] [SPEAKER_03]：或许工作停滞不前也是一种长期倦怠。你能忍受倦怠多久呢？
[00:08:56.960] [SPEAKER_03]: before it becomes something that you can't stand anymore? And that kind of propels you into
[00:08:56.960] [SPEAKER_03]：在它变成你再也无法忍受的事情之前？而那种感觉会驱使你……
[00:09:02.060] [SPEAKER_00]: the limbo of it all. So do you think there are any like notable signs that point towards burnout or
[00:09:02.060] [SPEAKER_00]：一切都处于一种进退两难的境地。那么你认为有没有什么明显的迹象表明你会倦怠？
[00:09:10.180] [SPEAKER_00]: job limbo? I think one thing that I can think of is if there's no like forward moving progress,
[00:09:10.180] [SPEAKER_00]：工作停滞不前？我想到的一点是，如果没有向前推进的进展，
[00:09:18.380] [SPEAKER_03]: like I mentioned earlier, and I feel like that actually comes in multiple forms. So one is if
[00:09:18.380] [SPEAKER_03]：就像我之前提到的，我觉得这实际上有多种形式。其中一种是，如果
[00:09:23.240] [SPEAKER_03]: you're stuck at the same position for a long time and not getting promoted or you're not
[00:09:23.240] [SPEAKER_03]：你长期停留在同一个职位上，没有得到晋升，或者你不是
[00:09:29.260] [SPEAKER_03]: getting handed like a bigger scope of work, you are truly just stuck in a sense, right? You're
[00:09:29.260] [SPEAKER_03]：被安排承担更大的工作范围，从某种意义上说，你真的被困住了，对吧？你
[00:09:34.840] [SPEAKER_03]: like stuck in your old R&R's, roles and responsibilities, and there's no like movement
[00:09:34.840] [SPEAKER_03]：就像被困在以前的休息和放松模式、角色和职责中，没有任何改变的可能。
[00:09:40.580] [SPEAKER_03]: forward. So I think that is definitely one big sign. The other sign is not seeing forward progress
[00:09:40.580] [SPEAKER_03]：向前。所以我认为这绝对是一个重要的信号。另一个信号是看不到任何进展。
[00:09:49.080] [SPEAKER_03]: in your work. And I feel like the other thing too could be you just get frustrated from not seeing
[00:09:49.080] [SPEAKER_03]：在你的工作中。我觉得还有一种可能是，你只是因为看不到而感到沮丧。
[00:09:54.600] [SPEAKER_03]: forward moving progress in your work. And one big sign is like, say you've been working on setting
[00:09:54.600] [SPEAKER_03]：你的工作正在取得进展。一个重要的标志是，比如说，你一直在致力于场景的设置。
[00:09:59.540] [SPEAKER_03]: up processes for something that you feel like is going to be a game changer for your team or your
[00:09:59.540] [SPEAKER_03]：为那些你认为会对你的团队或你的组织产生变革性影响的事情制定流程
[00:10:04.740] [SPEAKER_03]: department. And despite the new process, you still keep getting asked the same questions over and
[00:10:04.740] [SPEAKER_03]：部门。尽管有了新的流程，你仍然会被反复问到同样的问题，而且
[00:10:11.120] [SPEAKER_03]: over. You feel like you're just in like an infinite like loop of answering the same question. Yeah,
[00:10:11.120] [SPEAKER_03]：结束了。感觉就像陷入了一个无限循环，一直在回答同一个问题。是啊，
[00:10:17.660] [SPEAKER_03]: exactly. I mean, just like reliving the same day over and over. Then I feel like that could also
[00:10:17.660] [SPEAKER_03]：没错。我的意思是，就像一遍又一遍地重复同一天一样。我觉得那也可能
[00:10:22.680] [SPEAKER_00]: really make you start feeling stuck. That just feels very repetitive. And I'm sure, you know,
[00:10:22.680] [SPEAKER_00]：真的会让人感觉被困住了。感觉非常重复。而且我确信，你知道，
[00:10:28.480] [SPEAKER_00]: at a certain point it makes you start to question like, oh, why is this just like the same thing
[00:10:28.480] [SPEAKER_00]：到了某个时候，你会开始质疑，比如，哦，为什么这都一样？
[00:10:34.580] [SPEAKER_00]: every day? Dude, but also side note, R&R when I first got into the work corp culture and all that,
[00:10:34.580] [SPEAKER_00]：每天都这样？老兄，不过顺便提一下，我刚开始接触职场文化的时候，也经常会安排休息和放松之类的活动。
[00:10:42.040] [SPEAKER_00]: and you know, there's a lot of like corp slang and stuff. I know R&R as rest and relaxation.
[00:10:42.040] [SPEAKER_00]：你知道，公司里有很多行话之类的。我知道R&R的意思是休息和放松。
[00:10:50.540] [SPEAKER_00]: The first time someone was like, yeah, can we get like the R&Rs in order? I was like, wait,
[00:10:50.540] [SPEAKER_00]：第一次有人说，是啊，我们能把R&R（休息和休息）安排好吗？我当时就想，等等，
[00:10:55.520] [SPEAKER_00]: what? Like, are we not talking about work? What do rest and relaxation?
[00:10:55.520] [SPEAKER_00]：什么？难道我们不是在谈论工作吗？休息和放松算什么？
[00:11:00.660] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, yeah, I have a vacation. Oh my god. Also, have you seen that TikTok that was
[00:11:00.660] [SPEAKER_03]：你会想，哦，对，我休假了。我的天哪。还有，你看到那个TikTok视频了吗？
[00:11:05.900] [SPEAKER_03]: like if you say R&R, it sounds like an Australian person trying to say oh no.
[00:11:05.900] [SPEAKER_03]：就像你说 R&R 一样，听起来就像一个澳大利亚人想说“哦，不”。
[00:11:10.500] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, yes. I have seen that. R&R. R&R.
[00:11:10.500] [SPEAKER_00]：我的天哪，是的。我看过。R&R。R&R。
[00:11:18.140] [SPEAKER_00]: But back to the repetition and burnout of it all. I think another aspect slash sign is if you're
[00:11:18.140] [SPEAKER_00]：但回到重复和倦怠的问题上来。我认为另一个方面是，如果你是
[00:11:26.760] [SPEAKER_00]: trying to get out of that repetition by maybe like taking on new projects or setting new goals for
[00:11:26.760] [SPEAKER_00]：试图通过承担新项目或设定新目标来摆脱这种重复状态。
[00:11:31.220] [SPEAKER_00]: yourself, but none of these goals and projects are exciting or enticing to you. Yeah, at the
[00:11:31.220] [SPEAKER_00]：你自己，但这些目标和项目对你来说都不令人兴奋或有吸引力。是的，在
[00:11:37.920] [SPEAKER_03]: end of the day, it is work, but I feel like it should also spark some sort of joy. Otherwise,
[00:11:37.920] [SPEAKER_03]：说到底，这是工作，但我觉得它也应该带来某种快乐。否则，
[00:11:43.000] [SPEAKER_03]: we're just robots at work waiting for free time post-work and like on the weekends,
[00:11:43.000] [SPEAKER_03]：我们就像工作中的机器人，等着下班后和周末的空闲时间。
[00:11:49.020] [SPEAKER_03]: which I feel like is just unsustainable. You would lose motivation twice as fast, right?
[00:11:49.020] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这样根本无法持续。你的动力会下降得更快，对吧？
[00:11:53.140] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think you're totally right. Sometimes at a gut level, it's really like, am I feeling excited
[00:11:53.140] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得你说得完全对。有时候凭直觉，真的会觉得，我兴奋吗？
[00:11:58.300] [SPEAKER_03]: or am I feeling hopeful or any of these positive emotions or do I just feel dread, tired, stressed,
[00:11:58.300] [SPEAKER_03]：或者我感到充满希望或其他积极情绪，还是只感到恐惧、疲惫、压力重重？
[00:12:05.240] [SPEAKER_00]: that kind of negative emotion? And I feel like some people are really good at taking on these
[00:12:05.240] [SPEAKER_00]：那种负面情绪？我觉得有些人真的很擅长应对这些情绪。
[00:12:10.600] [SPEAKER_00]: more repetitive tasks and they thrive in that. So all the more kudos to them. But I feel like
[00:12:10.600] [SPEAKER_00]：他们更喜欢重复性工作，而且乐在其中。所以更应该称赞他们。但我感觉……
[00:12:17.400] [SPEAKER_00]: me personally, too much repetition sometimes can get very old very fast. So I feel like to me,
[00:12:17.400] [SPEAKER_00]：就我个人而言，重复太多次很快就会让人觉得很厌烦。所以我觉得，
[00:12:24.660] [SPEAKER_00]: there needs to be a certain level of, yeah, as you said, excitement or just something interesting
[00:12:24.660] [SPEAKER_00]：是的，就像你说的，需要有一定的刺激感，或者至少要有点意思。
[00:12:30.540] [SPEAKER_00]: that keeps you going. Like, okay, I know I have to do this one boring project, but it's okay because
[00:12:30.540] [SPEAKER_00]：这能让你坚持下去。比如，好吧，我知道我得去做这个无聊的项目，但没关系，因为
[00:12:36.840] [SPEAKER_00]: I know I have this other more exciting project on the horizon, something of that sort, like having
[00:12:36.840] [SPEAKER_00]：我知道我还有一个更令人兴奋的项目即将启动，类似这样的，比如……
[00:12:41.480] [SPEAKER_03]: that balance. Totally. I'm definitely someone who thrives on structure and routine. So I actually
[00:12:41.480] [SPEAKER_03]：那种平衡。完全正确。我绝对是个喜欢有条理和规律生活的人。所以实际上
[00:12:47.380] [SPEAKER_03]: don't mind repetitive stuff as much, but I feel like you can do a recurring task without it feeling
[00:12:47.380] [SPEAKER_03]：我不太介意重复性的工作，但我觉得你可以做一些重复性的任务而不觉得厌烦。
[00:12:52.420] [SPEAKER_03]: repetitive. So say your recurring task is a weekly email or a weekly report or something like that.
[00:12:52.420] [SPEAKER_03]：重复性任务。比如说，你的重复性任务是每周发送一封电子邮件或一份每周报告之类的。
[00:12:58.640] [SPEAKER_03]: You get really great feedback every time you send it out. Then I feel like each week is still new.
[00:12:58.640] [SPEAKER_03]：每次发出去都能收到非常好的反馈。所以我觉得每周都像新的一样。
[00:13:03.560] [SPEAKER_03]: It's rewarding. Like, you know, people are reading your stuff and benefiting from your labor of love.
[00:13:03.560] [SPEAKER_03]：这很有成就感。你知道，人们在阅读你的作品，并从你的心血之作中受益。
[00:13:08.980] [SPEAKER_03]: But on the flip side, if it's always met with no response or there doesn't seem to be a lot of
[00:13:08.980] [SPEAKER_03]：但另一方面，如果总是没有回应，或者似乎没有太多……
[00:13:15.620] [SPEAKER_03]: gain from the work you're doing, I feel like that can start to feel really, why am I doing this?
[00:13:15.620] [SPEAKER_03]：从你所做的工作中获得的收益，我觉得这可能会开始让人觉得，我为什么要做这件事？
[00:13:21.940] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah. And I've been reflecting on this a little bit, but I feel like just because you hit this
[00:13:21.940] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。我一直在思考这个问题，但我觉得仅仅因为你击中了这一点
[00:13:28.620] [SPEAKER_03]: certain point of, is my work actually benefiting people in the company or do I really feel
[00:13:28.620] [SPEAKER_03]：在某种程度上，我的工作是否真的对公司里的人有益，或者我只是感觉如此？
[00:13:34.540] [SPEAKER_03]: excitement and joy about what I'm doing? It doesn't necessarily mean that you're doomed to be
[00:13:34.540] [SPEAKER_03]：对我正在做的事情感到兴奋和快乐？但这并不一定意味着你注定要失败。
[00:13:40.220] [SPEAKER_03]: in job limbo. I feel like it doesn't mean that you have to do something drastic, but it is like that
[00:13:40.220] [SPEAKER_03]：目前处于工作困境。我觉得这并不意味着你必须采取什么极端措施，但情况就是这样。
[00:13:47.520] [SPEAKER_03]: first warning sign. So it's like, once you start to feel this, what do you feel comfortable doing?
[00:13:47.520] [SPEAKER_03]：第一个警告信号。所以，一旦你开始有这种感觉，你会觉得做什么比较舒服？
[00:13:52.460] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you comfortable enough to go to your boss and see if you can kind of switch things up?
[00:13:52.460] [SPEAKER_03]：你觉得你有足够的勇气去找你的老板，看看能不能换个工作方式吗？
[00:13:57.160] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you comfortable creating new processes and trying to push the improvement of what you're
[00:13:57.160] [SPEAKER_03]：您是否乐于创建新流程并努力推动现有流程的改进？
[00:14:03.220] [SPEAKER_03]: doing from your scope of work? And at the end of the day, this could be a starting point
[00:14:03.220] [SPEAKER_03]：这是你工作范围内需要做的吗？归根结底，这可能只是一个起点。
[00:14:08.620] [SPEAKER_03]: to discover what you want to do and what kind of work makes you feel really fulfilled.
[00:14:08.620] [SPEAKER_03]：去发现你想做什么，以及什么样的工作能让你感到真正的满足。
[00:14:13.780] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I completely agree. I think starting to realize you might be headed towards job limbo or
[00:14:13.780] [SPEAKER_00]：是的，我完全同意。我认为开始意识到自己可能正走向职业困境或
[00:14:19.220] [SPEAKER_00]: just having that feeling of job limbo is when you need to start reevaluating things. Just like you
[00:14:19.220] [SPEAKER_00]：当你感到工作前景不明朗时，就应该开始重新评估自己的未来了。就像你一样。
[00:14:25.680] [SPEAKER_00]: said, whether that means you need to look at your job holistically and be like, is this what I
[00:14:25.680] [SPEAKER_00]：说，这是否意味着你需要从整体上审视你的工作，并思考，这是否是我……
[00:14:31.200] [SPEAKER_00]: want to do? Or if you need to look at the more minute details and be like, oh, you know what,
[00:14:31.200] [SPEAKER_00]：你想做什么？或者如果你需要查看更细致的细节，然后想，哦，你知道吗，
[00:14:35.800] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe these are small things I can change. Or maybe sometimes it's even just to step back
[00:14:35.800] [SPEAKER_00]：也许这些都是我可以改变的小事。或者，有时候，我甚至只需要退后一步。
[00:14:41.620] [SPEAKER_00]: and take a look and be like, oh my god, I haven't taken a vacation in two years and I need to give
[00:14:41.620] [SPEAKER_00]：然后看看，你会想，我的天哪，我已经两年没休假了，我得好好休息一下。
[00:14:46.700] [SPEAKER_00]: myself a week off at least and just reset and see if that helps with the burnout feeling.
[00:14:46.700] [SPEAKER_00]：我至少给自己放一周假，好好调整一下，看看能不能缓解倦怠感。
[00:14:53.440] [SPEAKER_00]: It's like that moment that we've spoken of before where you go to the bathroom at a party
[00:14:53.440] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我们之前说过的，你在派对上去洗手间的那种情况。
[00:14:58.600] [SPEAKER_00]: and you look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, okay, what is happening right now? I need to
[00:14:58.600] [SPEAKER_00]：然后你看着镜子里的自己，心想，好吧，现在到底是怎么回事？我需要……
[00:15:05.260] [SPEAKER_00]: figure out what I'm going through. Dude, that is like the perfect analogy.
[00:15:05.260] [SPEAKER_00]：搞清楚我正在经历什么。老兄，这简直就是最贴切的比喻。
[00:15:10.540] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you do need to have that moment of clarity with yourself.
[00:15:10.540] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得你确实需要有那么一刻清醒的头脑。
[00:15:16.560] [SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about there's just so many factors that contribute to something like job
[00:15:16.560] [SPEAKER_03]：我们一直在讨论，影响就业这类事情的因素太多了。
[00:15:20.700] [SPEAKER_03]: limbo. I feel like what has helped me a lot in the past is taking a look at every step of the ladder.
[00:15:20.700] [SPEAKER_03]：进退两难。我觉得过去对我帮助最大的就是仔细审视每一步。
[00:15:27.940] [SPEAKER_03]: First, I'm like, do I like my work? Then I'm like, how am I feeling? Is there stuff outside of work
[00:15:27.940] [SPEAKER_03]：首先，我会问自己，我喜欢我的工作吗？然后我会问自己，我的感受如何？工作之外还有什么事情可做？
[00:15:33.620] [SPEAKER_03]: that's causing me to feel like this at work? Is there something that I can do to improve my daily
[00:15:33.620] [SPEAKER_03]：这导致我在工作中感觉如此糟糕吗？我能做些什么来改善我的日常工作呢？
[00:15:38.900] [SPEAKER_03]: routine? Maybe build up more stamina, work out more, go out more, hang out with friends and just
[00:15:38.900] [SPEAKER_03]：日常作息？或许可以增强体力，多锻炼，多出去走走，和朋友们聚聚，等等。
[00:15:44.560] [SPEAKER_03]: make myself generally happier. Then you can start to evaluate every step of the chain within your
[00:15:44.560] [SPEAKER_03]：让自己整体上更快乐。然后你就可以开始评估你内心链条中的每一步了。
[00:15:49.940] [SPEAKER_03]: work. It's like your boss, your team, your department, your company, and honestly, even
[00:15:49.940] [SPEAKER_03]：工作。就像你的老板、你的团队、你的部门、你的公司，说实话，甚至
[00:15:56.300] [SPEAKER_03]: your job and your career path. I think sitting down and being really honest with yourself about
[00:15:56.300] [SPEAKER_03]：你的工作和你的职业道路。我认为应该坐下来，对自己诚实地审视一下。
[00:16:00.780] [SPEAKER_03]: a lot of these things, especially when you're younger and earlier in your career is so crucial
[00:16:00.780] [SPEAKER_03]：很多这类事情，尤其是在你年轻、职业生涯早期的时候，都至关重要。
[00:16:06.660] [SPEAKER_00]: and key to diagnose what is wrong. I think what also helps is when this moment comes upon me,
[00:16:06.660] [SPEAKER_00]：这是诊断问题所在的关键。我认为，当这一刻来临的时候，也很有帮助。
[00:16:15.880] [SPEAKER_00]: I look back at my work and I think of what I'm grateful for in it. It's nice to remind yourself
[00:16:15.880] [SPEAKER_00]：回顾我的工作，我会思考其中值得感恩的事情。提醒自己这些是件好事。
[00:16:22.700] [SPEAKER_00]: sometimes too, like, oh, actually, I am really grateful for these aspects of my job. Then maybe
[00:16:22.700] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候也是，比如，哦，实际上，我真的很感激工作的这些方面。然后也许
[00:16:28.080] [SPEAKER_00]: you can make a pros and cons list and then reevaluate, oh, but are these pros worth the cons?
[00:16:28.080] [SPEAKER_00]：你可以列出优缺点，然后重新评估，哦，但是这些优点值得付出这些缺点吗？
[00:16:34.240] [SPEAKER_00]: Or it's like, oh, actually, dude, it's only two cons. I'm forgetting about how grateful I should
[00:16:34.240] [SPEAKER_00]：或者就像，哦，其实，老兄，只有两个缺点。我都忘了我应该有多感激了。
[00:16:38.900] [SPEAKER_00]: be for all these other things. I feel like that sometimes helps spark up some positive feelings
[00:16:38.900] [SPEAKER_00]：是为了其他所有的事情。我觉得这有时有助于激发一些积极的情绪。
[00:16:44.360] [SPEAKER_00]: again. It's like gratitude journaling for your work, for your job. Dude, I love that. I think
[00:16:44.360] [SPEAKER_00]：又来了。这就好比写感恩日记，记录你的工作和人生。老兄，我太喜欢这个了。我觉得
[00:16:50.100] [SPEAKER_03]: I've done something similar, but in a little bit more of a five-year plan kind of a way.
[00:16:50.100] [SPEAKER_03]：我做过类似的事情，但我的计划更像是五年计划。
[00:16:55.780] [SPEAKER_03]: At times where my job limbo felt pretty high, I actually forced myself to sit down and chart out
[00:16:55.780] [SPEAKER_03]：有时，当我的工作前景非常不明朗时，我强迫自己坐下来，制定计划……
[00:17:02.040] [SPEAKER_03]: 13-week sprints essentially. Really it's quarterly goals. I would see what kind of things excite me
[00:17:02.040] [SPEAKER_03]：基本上是13周的冲刺周期。实际上，是季度目标。我会看看什么事情能让我兴奋。
[00:17:09.140] [SPEAKER_03]: at work, also write down things that I don't love doing and then journal it all out on paper first.
[00:17:09.140] [SPEAKER_03]：在工作中，我也会记下我不喜欢做的事情，然后先把它们都写在纸上。
[00:17:16.160] [SPEAKER_03]: Then that could be something that I maybe take to my boss in my one-on-ones. Hey,
[00:17:16.160] [SPEAKER_03]：那这或许可以成为我和老板一对一谈话时要提到的一点。嘿，
[00:17:20.900] [SPEAKER_03]: things like this really excite me and I feel like would be super stimulating.
[00:17:20.900] [SPEAKER_03]：这样的事情真的让我很兴奋，我觉得会非常刺激。
[00:17:24.440] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't love doing these tasks, but I'm happy to do them. Then at least even if you still have
[00:17:24.440] [SPEAKER_03]：我并不喜欢做这些任务，但我乐意去做。这样至少即使你仍然有
[00:17:29.680] [SPEAKER_03]: to keep doing those things that you don't like to do, you're at least planting the seed and being
[00:17:29.680] [SPEAKER_03]：即使你不喜欢做那些事，但坚持去做，至少你已经播下了种子，并且正在成长。
[00:17:34.500] [SPEAKER_03]: vocal about it, which I think really is something that helps birth change. Your manager might still
[00:17:34.500] [SPEAKER_03]：要勇于表达，我认为这确实有助于促成改变。你的经理可能仍然
[00:17:39.920] [SPEAKER_03]: need you to do this right now, but let's say they get a new headcount in half a year or something.
[00:17:39.920] [SPEAKER_03]：现在就需要你做这件事，但假设他们半年后会重新调整人员编制。
[00:17:45.100] [SPEAKER_03]: They might remember like, oh, Jisoo said that she doesn't like doing this. Maybe with this
[00:17:45.100] [SPEAKER_03]：他们可能会记得，哦，Jisoo说过她不喜欢做这件事。也许通过这个
[00:17:49.360] [SPEAKER_03]: new person, they can help take this off her plate, something like that.
[00:17:49.360] [SPEAKER_03]：新来的人，可以帮她分担一些事情，诸如此类。
[00:17:52.440] [SPEAKER_00]: So true. I feel like I used to always fall in the trap of internalizing,
[00:17:52.440] [SPEAKER_00]：确实如此。我觉得我以前总是容易陷入内化的陷阱，
[00:17:56.980] [SPEAKER_00]: I guess, every perceived problem at work. Then I got advice that was, well, you can just tell
[00:17:56.980] [SPEAKER_00]：我想，就是工作中遇到的每一个问题。然后我得到了这样的建议：嗯，你一眼就能看出来。
[00:18:04.680] [SPEAKER_00]: your manager that you like these projects more than the other projects. I was like,
[00:18:04.680] [SPEAKER_00]：你的经理说你更喜欢这些项目而不是其他项目。我当时就想，
[00:18:10.140] [SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck? You can do that? But I was like, wait, that makes so much sense because yeah,
[00:18:10.140] [SPEAKER_00]：什么鬼？你居然能这么做？但我当时就想，等等，这解释得通，因为，是啊，
[00:18:16.060] [SPEAKER_00]: as you said, maybe you still have to do some of the more boring projects, but at least you know
[00:18:16.060] [SPEAKER_00]：正如你所说，或许你仍然需要做一些比较枯燥的项目，但至少你知道……
[00:18:20.020] [SPEAKER_00]: your manager, if they're a good one, is looking out for these other certain projects that they know
[00:18:20.020] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你的经理是个好经理，他们会留意他们知道的其他一些特定项目。
[00:18:26.320] [SPEAKER_00]: would bring you more joy at work. Because if you're a happy worker, you're going to produce
[00:18:26.320] [SPEAKER_00]：会让你在工作中更快乐。因为如果你是一个快乐的员工，你就会更有生产力。
[00:18:30.960] [SPEAKER_03]: better work too. Yeah. And I feel like a slightly more cynical way of looking at it too is just
[00:18:30.960] [SPEAKER_03]：做得更好。是的。而且我觉得，从稍微愤世嫉俗的角度来看待这件事也只是
[00:18:38.060] [SPEAKER_03]: because you're the type of person to not be vocal about these things, it doesn't mean that other
[00:18:38.060] [SPEAKER_03]：因为你这种人不会公开谈论这些事情，但这并不意味着其他人也不会。
[00:18:44.200] [SPEAKER_03]: people on your team aren't being vocal about it. So your coworker who is on the same team,
[00:18:44.200] [SPEAKER_03]：你团队里的人都没有公开表达自己的意见。所以你那个同队的同事，
[00:18:49.360] [SPEAKER_03]: reporting to the same manager, they might be able to kind of over the years, fine tune their
[00:18:49.360] [SPEAKER_03]：向同一位经理汇报工作，他们或许能够在多年积累中不断改进自己的工作。
[00:18:54.040] [SPEAKER_03]: projects to mostly what they want to do because they are being active and transparent about their
[00:18:54.040] [SPEAKER_03]：项目大多是他们想做的，因为他们积极主动，并且对自己的项目保持透明。
[00:18:59.000] [SPEAKER_03]: likes and dislikes. But you might have a worse split than them because you didn't vocalize your
[00:18:59.000] [SPEAKER_03]：喜好和厌恶。但你的喜好分歧可能比他们更严重，因为你没有表达出来。
[00:19:05.120] [SPEAKER_03]: opinions. In some ways, you are kind of missing out a little bit. And I feel like if you think
[00:19:05.120] [SPEAKER_03]：观点。在某些方面，你有点错过了一些东西。我觉得如果你认为
[00:19:11.340] [SPEAKER_00]: about it, this is for the better of yourself and actually ultimately probably for the team too.
[00:19:11.340] [SPEAKER_00]：关于这件事，这对你自身有好处，而且最终可能对团队也有好处。
[00:19:18.640] [SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a better state and doing work that you like and producing good work,
[00:19:18.640] [SPEAKER_00]：如果你现在状态更好，做着自己喜欢的工作，并且能做出好的作品，
[00:19:24.020] [SPEAKER_00]: that's ultimately better for the team too and the people around you. So I think that's something I
[00:19:24.020] [SPEAKER_00]：这最终对团队和身边的人都有好处。所以我认为这是我应该做的。
[00:19:29.360] [SPEAKER_00]: had to learn too. You don't have to just put your head down and do the work and just take everything.
[00:19:29.360] [SPEAKER_00]：我也得学习。你不能只是埋头苦干，然后什么都接受。
[00:19:35.460] [SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely okay to voice some of your opinions and hopefully have your voice heard.
[00:19:35.460] [SPEAKER_00]：表达自己的意见当然没问题，希望自己的声音能被听到。
[00:19:40.120] [SPEAKER_00]: And I guess if things don't get better for you, then that's a sign of further action that you
[00:19:40.120] [SPEAKER_00]：我想，如果你的情况没有好转，那就表明你需要采取进一步行动。
[00:19:46.280] [SPEAKER_00]: might have to take, whether that's reevaluating and finding a new job or thinking about what
[00:19:46.280] [SPEAKER_00]：可能不得不采取一些措施，无论是重新评估并寻找新工作，还是思考……
[00:19:51.300] [SPEAKER_00]: roles do bring you happiness and that kind of stuff. Yeah, I completely resonate with that.
[00:19:51.300] [SPEAKER_00]：角色确实能给人带来快乐之类的东西。是的，我完全同意。
[00:19:56.400] [SPEAKER_03]: And it reminds me of something that one of my bosses has told me in the past. I think this goes
[00:19:56.400] [SPEAKER_03]：这让我想起我一位老板以前跟我说过的话。我想是这样的：
[00:20:03.200] [SPEAKER_03]: both ways in terms of if you're a manager giving feedback to your team or if you're a team member
[00:20:03.200] [SPEAKER_03]：无论是作为管理者向团队提供反馈，还是作为团队成员，这两种情况都适用。
[00:20:09.200] [SPEAKER_03]: giving feedback to your manager. A lot of companies do annual performance reviews and that's when you
[00:20:09.200] [SPEAKER_03]：向你的经理提供反馈。很多公司都会进行年度绩效考核，而这正是你……
[00:20:14.500] [SPEAKER_03]: go through your roles and responsibilities as well as evaluating the feedback of your work in the
[00:20:14.500] [SPEAKER_03]：回顾一下你的角色和职责，并评估你工作中收到的反馈。
[00:20:20.240] [SPEAKER_03]: past year. And what my manager told me was that anything you ever discuss in your annual performance
[00:20:20.240] [SPEAKER_03]：过去一年。我的经理告诉我，你在年度绩效考核中讨论的任何事情。
[00:20:27.080] [SPEAKER_03]: reviews, it should never be a surprise. These are things that you have brought up to each other
[00:20:27.080] [SPEAKER_03]：评论，这不应该让人感到意外。这些都是你们彼此讨论过的事情。
[00:20:31.940] [SPEAKER_03]: during your weekly TBs, concerns that you might have had one way or another, and there should
[00:20:31.940] [SPEAKER_03]：在您每周的结核病检查中，您可能存在的各种担忧应该得到解决。
[00:20:38.480] [SPEAKER_03]: always be that open line of communication even throughout the year, which also then means that
[00:20:38.480] [SPEAKER_03]：即使在一年中的任何时候，也要始终保持畅通的沟通渠道，这也意味着：
[00:20:44.120] [SPEAKER_03]: you should be thinking about these things throughout the year too. So I think not waiting
[00:20:44.120] [SPEAKER_03]：你也应该全年都思考这些事情。所以我认为不要等到以后。
[00:20:48.760] [SPEAKER_03]: for that formal once in a year time to be like, yeah, I actually don't really like this project.
[00:20:48.760] [SPEAKER_03]：一年一度的正式场合，你可能会想，是啊，我其实不太喜欢这个项目。
[00:20:54.220] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like, actually, I've been hating my job for the past year. Yeah, you're like, this is
[00:20:54.220] [SPEAKER_03]：你会想，其实，过去一年我一直很讨厌我的工作。是啊，你会想，这真是……
[00:20:58.660] [SPEAKER_00]: like my greatest accomplishment, but I fucking hated it. Wait, oh my god, you call your one-on-ones TBs?
[00:20:58.660] [SPEAKER_00]：就像我最大的成就一样，但我他妈的讨厌它。等等，我的天，你把一对一谈话叫做TBs？
[00:21:05.240] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, touch base. Whoa, mine's just one colon one.
[00:21:05.240] [SPEAKER_00]：是的，保持联系。哇，我的只有一个冒号。
[00:21:11.660] [SPEAKER_03]: But really at the end of the day, I think it goes to show you are totally valid in feeling the things
[00:21:11.660] [SPEAKER_03]：但说到底，我认为这说明你有这些感受是完全合理的。
[00:21:17.440] [SPEAKER_03]: that you feel about your work and it doesn't always have to be like a temper tantrum during
[00:21:17.440] [SPEAKER_03]：你对工作的感受，并不总是像发脾气那样。
[00:21:22.580] [SPEAKER_03]: a TBF. I don't like this work. It can be something very normal and casual like, yeah, I'll do it, but
[00:21:22.580] [SPEAKER_03]：说实话，我不喜欢这份工作。它可以是很普通、很随意的工作，比如，嗯，我会做，但是……
[00:21:26.880] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I generally prefer projects like this. So you can totally keep it professional while still
[00:21:26.880] [SPEAKER_03]：我通常更喜欢这样的项目。这样你既能保持专业性，又能……
[00:21:33.060] [SPEAKER_00]: not being silenced about your thoughts. For sure. And even better is when your manager is like, oh,
[00:21:33.060] [SPEAKER_00]：你的想法不会被压制。当然。更好的情况是，你的经理会说，哦，
[00:21:38.540] [SPEAKER_00]: what kind of projects do you like? And you're like, oh yes, I didn't even have to bring it up myself.
[00:21:38.540] [SPEAKER_00]：你喜欢什么样的项目？然后你就会想，哦，是的，我甚至不用自己提。
[00:21:43.120] [SPEAKER_00]: You're like any project that's not like this.
[00:21:43.120] [SPEAKER_00]：你就像任何一个与此不同的项目。
[00:21:46.960] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe one of the best opportunities to bring it up is when you're near the conclusion
[00:21:46.960] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得提出这个问题的最佳时机之一，就是在接近结尾的时候。
[00:21:51.800] [SPEAKER_00]: or have finished a project because then you can be like, oh, let's debrief about this project.
[00:21:51.800] [SPEAKER_00]：或者完成一个项目，因为那样你就可以说，哦，让我们来总结一下这个项目。
[00:21:56.560] [SPEAKER_00]: I think we accomplished all this blah, blah, blah. And then at the end you could be like,
[00:21:56.560] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得我们完成了所有这些等等等等。然后最后你可能会想，
[00:22:00.020] [SPEAKER_00]: honestly, it was a good project, but it's not like my favorite type. So hopefully in the future
[00:22:00.020] [SPEAKER_00]：说实话，这个项目不错，但不是我最喜欢的类型。所以希望以后有机会能有更多这样的机会。
[00:22:05.020] [SPEAKER_00]: we can look for projects like this. Or you could be like, oh my God, I loved this project.
[00:22:05.020] [SPEAKER_00]：我们可以寻找类似的项目。或者你可能会说，天哪，我太喜欢这个项目了。
[00:22:10.080] [SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have more projects like this. Dude. Yeah. That's such a good point. Cause in
[00:22:10.080] [SPEAKER_00]：我非常希望有更多这样的项目。兄弟。是啊。你说得太对了。因为在
[00:22:14.400] [SPEAKER_03]: the postmortem you're coming into it already having done the task that was asked of you.
[00:22:14.400] [SPEAKER_03]：事后分析，你已经完成了被要求完成的任务。
[00:22:19.700] [SPEAKER_03]: So you have a little bit more leverage because you could be like, yeah, well,
[00:22:19.700] [SPEAKER_03]：所以你稍微有点话语权，因为你可以说，是啊，好吧，
[00:22:23.180] [SPEAKER_03]: I did finish this project even though I now realize it wasn't my favorite.
[00:22:23.180] [SPEAKER_03]：虽然我现在意识到这不是我最喜欢的项目，但我还是完成了它。
[00:22:27.600] [SPEAKER_00]: Dude. Can we talk about the word postmortem? Why do we use that as the debrief word
[00:22:27.600] [SPEAKER_00]：哥们儿，我们能聊聊“事后分析”这个词吗？为什么我们用它作为汇报总结的用语？
[00:22:34.640] [SPEAKER_03]: for projects? It's so morbid. It totally is. I always think of a corpse every time I hear that
[00:22:34.640] [SPEAKER_03]：用于项目？这太病态了。确实如此。我每次听到这话都会想到尸体。
[00:22:42.340] [SPEAKER_00]: word. Wait, same. I literally am thinking of the basement where all the dead bodies are. Oh God.
[00:22:42.340] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。等等，我也是。我脑子里想的竟然是那个堆满尸体的地下室。我的天哪。
[00:22:50.040] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why do we need to call this a postmortem?
[00:22:50.040] [SPEAKER_00]：我就想问，为什么我们需要称之为事后分析？
[00:22:55.320] [SPEAKER_00]: True. Actually, do we need a funeral for the project too? Honestly, corpse slang. There's
[00:22:55.320] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。说真的，我们是不是也需要为这个项目办个葬礼？说真的，用“尸体”这个词有点夸张了。
[00:23:01.900] [SPEAKER_00]: a lot of weird shit out there. There really is. I mean, just in this one episode alone,
[00:23:01.900] [SPEAKER_00]：外面有很多奇奇怪怪的事。真的。我的意思是，光是这一集就有很多，
[00:23:06.560] [SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about like at least four or five, like corpse speak words. True. You know,
[00:23:06.560] [SPEAKER_00]：我们至少讨论过四五个，就像尸体说话的词。没错。你知道，
[00:23:12.180] [SPEAKER_03]: which one I really like? Which one? Reinvent the wheel. Oh my God. I'm like, that's a banger.
[00:23:12.180] [SPEAKER_03]：我最喜欢哪个？哪个？重新发明轮子。我的天哪。我就觉得，这太棒了。
[00:23:18.320] [SPEAKER_00]: You're right. No one needs to reinvent that. We use that one so much, especially because I'm like,
[00:23:18.320] [SPEAKER_00]：你说得对。没必要重新发明这个。我们经常用这个，尤其是我当时就想，
[00:23:23.660] [SPEAKER_00]: graphic design, right? So we're like, oh, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Like we don't need to
[00:23:23.660] [SPEAKER_00]：平面设计，对吧？所以我们就想，哦，我们不需要重新发明轮子。就像我们不需要……
[00:23:28.020] [SPEAKER_00]: create a brand new design for like every single thing. And I'm like, yeah, you're right. But also
[00:23:28.020] [SPEAKER_00]：几乎每样东西都要重新设计。我就想，是啊，你说得对。但是也
[00:23:33.980] [SPEAKER_00]: there's some other funny ones like no one's saving lives here. True. That's like the privilege
[00:23:33.980] [SPEAKER_00]：还有一些其他搞笑的说法，比如“这里没人救人”。确实如此。这简直就是特权。
[00:23:40.880] [SPEAKER_00]: of working for corporate America and not in healthcare or something. Yeah, very true. But
[00:23:40.880] [SPEAKER_00]：为美国企业工作，而不是在医疗保健或其他行业。是的，非常正确。但是
[00:23:46.580] [SPEAKER_00]: back on our topic, I do have this thought about job limbo. It's not always a bad thing, I think.
[00:23:46.580] [SPEAKER_00]：回到我们的话题，我确实对工作不稳定这个问题有些想法。我认为这并不总是件坏事。
[00:23:52.760] [SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes it is really a good thing because as we mentioned, sometimes it's a signifier like,
[00:23:52.760] [SPEAKER_00]：我认为有时候这确实是一件好事，因为正如我们提到的，有时候它是一个信号，比如，
[00:23:59.000] [SPEAKER_00]: oh, I need to reevaluate where I am right now and how I'm feeling about things. I actually strongly
[00:23:59.000] [SPEAKER_00]：哦，我需要重新评估一下我现在所处的位置以及我对事情的感受。实际上，我强烈
[00:24:05.940] [SPEAKER_00]: believe that it's really nice to start a new job and have a clean slate every, I don't know,
[00:24:05.940] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得开始一份新工作，一切从零开始，真的很好，我不知道，
[00:24:13.180] [SPEAKER_00]: X amount of years. I mean, I know some people take it to the extreme and they like to switch jobs
[00:24:13.180] [SPEAKER_00]：X 年。我的意思是，我知道有些人走极端，他们喜欢频繁换工作。
[00:24:18.800] [SPEAKER_00]: every one to two years. But I just feel like the concept of starting fresh at a new company is like
[00:24:18.800] [SPEAKER_00]：每隔一到两年。但我感觉在一家新公司重新开始的概念就像……
[00:24:25.480] [SPEAKER_00]: very liberating and very nice. Yeah, I think that's a good point. When you stay at a company
[00:24:25.480] [SPEAKER_00]：非常自由，非常好。是的，我觉得你说得对。当你留在一家公司时
[00:24:32.340] [SPEAKER_03]: for a long time, I feel like there's just so many trailing responsibilities, even if you move
[00:24:32.340] [SPEAKER_03]：很长一段时间以来，我觉得即使搬家，也总是有很多责任需要承担。
[00:24:37.020] [SPEAKER_03]: departments or move roles. It's nobody's fault that you're still probably like the historian
[00:24:37.020] [SPEAKER_03]：换部门或者调换岗位。你现在可能仍然像个历史学家，这也不是任何人的错。
[00:24:44.280] [SPEAKER_03]: for that old thing. And you're the only one who knows this thing or another. So I can totally
[00:24:44.280] [SPEAKER_03]：为了那件旧东西。而且只有你知道这件东西或那件旧东西。所以我完全可以
[00:24:49.880] [SPEAKER_03]: imagine how having a clean slate could be refreshing. And plus, it's just accelerated
[00:24:49.880] [SPEAKER_03]：想象一下，一切从零开始该是多么令人耳目一新。而且，这只会加速……
[00:24:55.000] [SPEAKER_03]: growth, right? Ideally in a company, even if you stay there for a long time, you would still be
[00:24:55.000] [SPEAKER_03]：成长，对吧？理想情况下，在一家公司里，即使你待了很长时间，你仍然会……
[00:24:59.760] [SPEAKER_03]: growing at a pretty good pace. But when you are put onto a new team, new company, sometimes even
[00:24:59.760] [SPEAKER_03]：发展速度相当不错。但当你被调到一个新的团队、一家新公司时，有时甚至
[00:25:06.040] [SPEAKER_03]: new industry, there's just such a bigger pool of things to learn and absorb. So you're like a dry
[00:25:06.040] [SPEAKER_03]：在一个新兴行业，需要学习和吸收的东西实在太多了。所以你就像一个干巴巴的……
[00:25:12.060] [SPEAKER_00]: sponge tossed into the ocean. Yeah, and I feel like it's fun to be the newbie once in a while.
[00:25:12.060] [SPEAKER_00]：就像把海绵扔进大海一样。是啊，我觉得偶尔当一次新手也挺有意思的。
[00:25:19.800] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of thinking about this, and it's almost like you're creating your own life stages.
[00:25:19.800] [SPEAKER_00]：我一直在思考这个问题，这就像你在创造自己的人生阶段一样。
[00:25:26.620] [SPEAKER_00]: When we're younger, things are set. We go to elementary school for five or six years. High
[00:25:26.620] [SPEAKER_00]：我们小时候，一切都已成定局。我们上五六年小学。高中
[00:25:32.740] [SPEAKER_00]: school is four years. College is four to five, whatever years. But jobs, we are definitely more
[00:25:32.740] [SPEAKER_00]：学校教育是四年。大学教育是四到五年，或者更多年。但是工作，我们肯定更……
[00:25:39.060] [SPEAKER_00]: in control of this because there's no set schedule. It's not like, oh, I need to be at this job for
[00:25:39.060] [SPEAKER_00]：我能掌控这一切，因为没有固定的工作时间。这不像是，哦，我必须在这份工作上待多久
[00:25:43.820] [SPEAKER_00]: five years to graduate or something. It's like, hey, I think I've had as much fun as I could
[00:25:43.820] [SPEAKER_00]：还有五年时间毕业什么的。感觉就像，嘿，我觉得我已经尽情享受过了。
[00:25:51.040] [SPEAKER_00]: at this job, and now I'm ready to try something new. Go to a different industry or try a
[00:25:51.040] [SPEAKER_00]：我厌倦了这份工作，现在准备尝试一些新的东西。去另一个行业或者尝试……
[00:25:56.980] [SPEAKER_00]: different role or just go to a different company that I like. And I feel like that kind of lets you
[00:25:56.980] [SPEAKER_00]：换个角色，或者去一家我喜欢的其他公司。我觉得这样可以让你……
[00:26:02.080] [SPEAKER_00]: create your own life stages, in a sense. It's like, oh, those years were my whatever era,
[00:26:02.080] [SPEAKER_00]：从某种意义上说，你可以创造自己的人生阶段。就像，哦，那些年是我的某个时代，
[00:26:08.820] [SPEAKER_00]: and these years are my this new company era. New era unlawed. Yeah. That is a really good point,
[00:26:08.820] [SPEAKER_00]：这些年是我公司的新时代。新时代，不受法律约束。是的。这确实是一个很好的观点。
[00:26:15.680] [SPEAKER_03]: though, because there's no existing structure. Or even though people might preach about like,
[00:26:15.680] [SPEAKER_03]：虽然，因为没有现成的结构。或者即使人们可能会宣扬诸如……之类的，
[00:26:21.560] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, you should leave your company every X number of years, at the end of the day, it's your choice.
[00:26:21.560] [SPEAKER_03]: 哦，你应该每隔几年就离开你的公司，归根结底，这是你自己的选择。
[00:26:26.660] [SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that's also what makes it so hard to leave sometimes,
[00:26:26.660] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这也是为什么有时候离开会如此艰难的原因。
[00:26:30.260] [SPEAKER_03]: even if you've been in job limbo for a while or feeling a little bit stagnant at your company.
[00:26:30.260] [SPEAKER_03]：即使你已经有一段时间处于工作停滞状态，或者感觉在公司里有点停滞不前。
[00:26:37.100] [SPEAKER_03]: It could be a scary leap to try to job hunt or look elsewhere because it's breaking your status
[00:26:37.100] [SPEAKER_03]：尝试找工作或另谋出路可能是一次可怕的尝试，因为它会打破你的现状。
[00:26:44.400] [SPEAKER_03]: quo, right? That's true. Knowingly making a big change in your routine and what you know.
[00:26:44.400] [SPEAKER_03]：没错，对吧？确实如此。明知故犯地对你的日常习惯和已知事物做出重大改变。
[00:26:48.520] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And I think it also really depends on your personality too. I think I'm the type of person
[00:26:48.520] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。而且我觉得这真的也取决于你的性格。我觉得我就是那种人。
[00:26:53.660] [SPEAKER_00]: who would really enjoy trying something new, experiencing new things and learning new things.
[00:26:53.660] [SPEAKER_00]：谁会真正喜欢尝试新事物、体验新事物和学习新事物呢？
[00:26:59.900] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people are just like, I don't care that much to have that kind of excitement in this
[00:26:59.900] [SPEAKER_00]：有时候人们会说，我没那么在意这件事，没那么兴奋。
[00:27:05.920] [SPEAKER_00]: portion of my life. I'm perfectly happy with staying at this company for 10 plus years,
[00:27:05.920] [SPEAKER_00]：这是我人生的一部分。我非常乐意在这家公司待上十多年。
[00:27:13.200] [SPEAKER_00]: and there's totally nothing wrong with that. But I think for me personally, it's definitely an
[00:27:13.200] [SPEAKER_00]：这完全没问题。但就我个人而言，这绝对是……
[00:27:18.120] [SPEAKER_03]: exciting idea. Yeah. And I think at the end of the day, this is something that is so personal to you
[00:27:18.120] [SPEAKER_03]：真是个令人兴奋的想法。是的。而且我认为归根结底，这其实是你个人的事情。
[00:27:24.220] [SPEAKER_03]: where you feel like you're at your relationship with people at your company, et cetera, on how
[00:27:24.220] [SPEAKER_03]：你觉得自己在公司里与同事的关系如何等等，关于如何
[00:27:28.760] [SPEAKER_03]: you want to move forward from the job limbo. I feel like in my career, I have felt this kind of
[00:27:28.760] [SPEAKER_03]：你想摆脱工作上的停滞状态。我觉得在我的职业生涯中，我一直都有这种感觉。
[00:27:33.860] [SPEAKER_03]: on and off. Sometimes the solution is something so simple. There was this one time I was feeling
[00:27:33.860] [SPEAKER_03]：开，关。有时候，解决办法就这么简单。有一次，我感觉
[00:27:40.780] [SPEAKER_03]: job limbo and I just felt so stuck and a little bit understimulated with what I was doing. And then
[00:27:40.780] [SPEAKER_03]：工作状态很不稳定，我感觉自己被困住了，而且对目前的工作也缺乏热情。
[00:27:47.960] [SPEAKER_03]: I binged succession and I felt this insane motivation, like the surge of work is life.
[00:27:47.960] [SPEAKER_03]: 我一口气看完了《继承之战》，感觉自己动力爆棚，工作就是我的生命。
[00:27:56.080] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to devote my all to this company. I see. And that honestly was what fueled me for
[00:27:56.080] [SPEAKER_03]：我会全身心投入到这家公司。我明白了。说实话，这正是激励我的动力。
[00:28:03.640] [SPEAKER_03]: a specific duration of time. That's insane.
[00:28:03.640] [SPEAKER_03]：一段特定的时间。这太荒谬了。
[00:28:10.780] [SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you just have to watch a show that puts you in the mood to work.
[00:28:10.780] [SPEAKER_03]：所以有时候你只需要看个能让你进入工作状态的节目。
[00:28:16.680] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes. Okay. I know I sound crazy, but I swear it actually works. No, I think I can feel that
[00:28:16.680] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。好的。我知道我听起来像个疯子，但我发誓它真的有效。不，我想我能感觉到。
[00:28:24.240] [SPEAKER_00]: because depending on what show I'm watching, sometimes I literally become the main character.
[00:28:24.240] [SPEAKER_00]：因为根据我观看的节目，有时我真的会成为主角。
[00:28:29.160] [SPEAKER_00]: So if the show is about work, I could get into that.
[00:28:29.160] [SPEAKER_00]：所以如果这个节目是关于工作的，我可以参与其中。
[00:28:35.580] [SPEAKER_02]: It's foreplay. Get you in the right mood.
[00:28:35.580] [SPEAKER_02]：这是前戏，让你进入状态。
[00:28:41.400] [SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, one of the simpler ones was taking a vacation. I think it was a year or two ago.
[00:28:41.400] [SPEAKER_00]：我觉得对我来说，最简单的办法之一就是休假。我想那是在一两年前的事了。
[00:28:48.540] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, one, it was very chill during December when other people were taking vacations
[00:28:48.540] [SPEAKER_00]：嗯，首先，12月的时候天气很凉爽，因为其他人都在休假。
[00:28:53.140] [SPEAKER_00]: and we came back for the new year and I was literally so invigorated. I was like,
[00:28:53.140] [SPEAKER_00]：我们新年回来后，我简直精神焕发。我当时就想，
[00:28:58.120] [SPEAKER_00]: I am so ready to work. I was on top of everything, above and beyond low key. I was ahead of everything
[00:28:58.120] [SPEAKER_00]：我已经做好充分准备投入工作。我掌控着一切，而且做得非常出色，甚至可以说是超常发挥。我事事领先。
[00:29:04.200] [SPEAKER_00]: for a week. And then I took a real vacation because I didn't take a vacation in December.
[00:29:04.200] [SPEAKER_00]：休息了一周。然后我才真正休了个假，因为12月我没休假。
[00:29:11.400] [SPEAKER_00]: I took a real vacation in February or something. And then when I came back,
[00:29:11.400] [SPEAKER_00]：我二月份的时候休了个真正的假。然后我回来之后，
[00:29:15.760] [SPEAKER_00]: I was still just so invigorated. And I was like, wow, I need to get back on that feeling.
[00:29:15.760] [SPEAKER_00]：我当时仍然精神抖擞。我就想，哇，我得重新找回那种感觉。
[00:29:24.460] [SPEAKER_00]: I need a vacation, I guess.
[00:29:24.460] [SPEAKER_00]：我想我需要休假了。
[00:29:26.760] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, so true. Sometimes it really is all this simple stuff. There was definitely one time where
[00:29:26.760] [SPEAKER_03]：兄弟，说得太对了。有时候，问题真的就出在这些简单的事上。确实有那么一次，
[00:29:32.820] [SPEAKER_03]: I felt so unmotivated and it was just turning into general negative feelings about work.
[00:29:32.820] [SPEAKER_03]：我感到非常没有动力，而且对工作产生了普遍的消极情绪。
[00:29:39.040] [SPEAKER_03]: And then I made a really close friend at the company and then I loved work again.
[00:29:39.040] [SPEAKER_03]：然后我在公司里交到了一个非常好的朋友，然后我又重新爱上了工作。
[00:29:43.440] [SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the way it is, is maybe you feel these very specific feelings about work. Like,
[00:29:43.440] [SPEAKER_03]：我想，情况就是这样，你可能对工作有非常具体的感受。比如，
[00:29:49.340] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, I'm burnt out and I need a day off or I feel lonely at work. But if you're really busy in your
[00:29:49.340] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，我累坏了，需要休息一天，不然上班会觉得很孤独。但如果你真的很忙，
[00:29:55.720] [SPEAKER_03]: day to day, it can just come to you in the form of one big negative cloud of emotion. You're just
[00:29:55.720] [SPEAKER_03]：日复一日，它可能以一大片负面情绪的形式袭来。你只是
[00:30:01.720] [SPEAKER_03]: generally like, oh, I dislike work or I don't want to go into work or something. So then I feel like
[00:30:01.720] [SPEAKER_03]：通常情况下，比如，哦，我不喜欢工作，或者我不想去上班之类的。然后我就觉得……
[00:30:06.780] [SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it's your responsibility to be your own doctor, emotions doctor. And be like, why am I
[00:30:06.780] [SPEAKER_03]：有时候，你得自己当自己的医生，自己的情绪医生。然后问问自己，为什么我会这样？
[00:30:12.600] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling like this? That's true, actually. I did receive advice to figure out first, are you
[00:30:12.600] [SPEAKER_00]：有这种感觉吗？确实如此。我之前收到建议，要先弄清楚，你……
[00:30:19.920] [SPEAKER_00]: experiencing burnout? Do you need to take a moment, take a couple of days off and feel better?
[00:30:19.920] [SPEAKER_00]：感觉精疲力竭吗？你需要休息一下，休息几天，让自己感觉好些吗？
[00:30:27.580] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you just keep figuring it out. If it wasn't burnout, then could it be this?
[00:30:27.580] [SPEAKER_00]：然后你就得继续琢磨。如果不是倦怠，那会不会是这个原因呢？
[00:30:33.980] [SPEAKER_00]: If it was burnout, great, you solved your problem. You know what the next steps probably should be.
[00:30:33.980] [SPEAKER_00]：如果是职业倦怠，那就太好了，你已经解决了问题。你应该知道下一步该怎么做。
[00:30:39.080] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I guess I never really thought about actually figuring out if it's
[00:30:39.080] [SPEAKER_00]：然后我就想，是啊，我猜我从来没真正想过要弄清楚它是不是……
[00:30:44.580] [SPEAKER_00]: burnout or not. I just slap on a phrase and assume it's true. But maybe it was actually
[00:30:44.580] [SPEAKER_00]：不管是不是倦怠，我只是随便套用一个词，就想当然地认为它是真的。但也许它真的是真的。
[00:30:49.340] [SPEAKER_00]: something else. Maybe I'm burnt out in a different aspect of life and then that's affecting other
[00:30:49.340] [SPEAKER_00]：可能是其他原因。也许我在生活的其他方面感到疲惫，然后这种疲惫影响到了其他方面。
[00:30:54.620] [SPEAKER_03]: parts of my life. I feel like this is when something like journaling comes in so handy,
[00:30:54.620] [SPEAKER_03]：我生活中的一些片段。我觉得这时候写日记之类的东西就非常有用。
[00:30:59.340] [SPEAKER_03]: because for me, if I don't sit down and talk to someone or write about what I'm feeling,
[00:30:59.340] [SPEAKER_03]：因为对我来说，如果我不坐下来和别人谈谈，或者写下我的感受，
[00:31:04.300] [SPEAKER_03]: it's just a general negative. I'm like, boo. That's just what my thoughts sound like until
[00:31:04.300] [SPEAKER_03]：就是很消极。我就觉得，呸。我当时就是这么想的，直到……
[00:31:12.020] [SPEAKER_03]: I sit down and weed through them a little bit. So I think you're right. It's about identifying
[00:31:12.020] [SPEAKER_03]：我坐下来稍微筛选一下。所以我觉得你说得对。关键在于识别。
[00:31:18.620] [SPEAKER_03]: the root cause and trying to attack it from there so that you have a more specific game plan.
[00:31:18.620] [SPEAKER_03]：找到根本原因，然后从那里着手解决问题，这样你就能制定一个更具体的行动计划。
[00:31:24.560] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Otherwise you're just like, I feel like shit. Why do I feel like shit? I don't know.
[00:31:24.560] [SPEAKER_00]：是啊。不然你就会觉得，我感觉糟透了。为什么我感觉糟透了？我不知道。
[00:31:28.460] [SPEAKER_03]: I just do. It's actually been very motivational in a sense to kind of sit down and talk through
[00:31:28.460] [SPEAKER_03]：我就是这么做的。实际上，坐下来好好谈谈这件事，从某种意义上来说，真的很有激励作用。
[00:31:35.060] [SPEAKER_03]: job limbo with you, because I think with the term, this is something that maybe a lot of people have
[00:31:35.060] [SPEAKER_03]：和你一样，也面临着工作上的困境，因为我觉得用这个词来形容这种情况，可能很多人都有这种感觉。
[00:31:39.880] [SPEAKER_03]: felt before, but I had never felt like there was a true solution or a plan out from feeling job
[00:31:39.880] [SPEAKER_03]：以前也有过这种感觉，但我从未觉得有真正的解决办法或计划可以摆脱这种工作压力。
[00:31:46.840] [SPEAKER_03]: limbo. Now that we've sat down and talked through it, I feel like there is a pretty big array of
[00:31:46.840] [SPEAKER_03]：进退两难。现在我们坐下来好好谈过了，我觉得有很多方面……
[00:31:51.500] [SPEAKER_03]: things that you could do. Some of them being as silly as binge watching Succession and others
[00:31:51.500] [SPEAKER_03]：你可以做的事情。有些事情很傻，比如一口气看完《继承之战》等等。
[00:31:57.320] [SPEAKER_03]: being a little bit more thoughtful and intuitive, like sitting down and having that honest mirror
[00:31:57.320] [SPEAKER_03]：要更深思熟虑、更有直觉，就像坐下来，对着镜子诚实地审视自己一样。
[00:32:03.020] [SPEAKER_03]: conversation with yourself. Thank you, Krystal, for kind of decoding the phrase job limbo with
[00:32:03.020] [SPEAKER_03]：自言自语。谢谢你，Krystal，帮我解读了“工作困境”这个词。
