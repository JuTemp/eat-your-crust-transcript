[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo. Today we have a slang word to talk about and I like this one a lot because I think it just
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。今天我们要聊一个俚语，我很喜欢这个词，因为我觉得它……
[00:00:21.060] makes comments that much funnier for no reason at all really but the word is unserious. It's relatively easy to use, very easy to understand, and definitely has a lot of humor behind it.
[00:00:21.060] 这个词本身就带有一种不严肃的意味，所以用起来会显得格外有趣，其实也没什么特别的原因。它使用起来相对简单，很容易理解，而且确实蕴含着很多幽默元素。
[00:00:35.140] So usually you just use it to describe someone who's doing something silly and you call them very unserious. Maybe it's because this is not how we normally describe people, the opposite of serious. We have words for that like silly, goofy, or whatever but it's like
[00:00:35.140] 所以通常你用它来形容某人做了傻事，说他们很不严肃。也许是因为我们通常不会用这种方式来形容人，来形容严肃的反义词。我们有像“傻乎乎的”、“滑稽的”之类的词，但感觉就像……
[00:00:52.660] we're pointing out that it's the opposite of serious here and it makes the comments that much funnier. It's true because sometimes people are unserious but they're not necessarily goofy. I feel like goofy puts too much intentionality behind like oh I'm gonna be a silly, goofy person
[00:00:52.660] 我们想指出，这里的情况恰恰相反，非常严肃，这反而让评论更有趣。的确如此，因为有时候人们虽然不严肃，但并不一定很傻。我觉得“傻”这个词用得太刻意了，好像“哦，我要做一个傻乎乎的傻瓜”似的。
[00:01:07.860] but when someone is unserious it just captures a lot without being too pointed of a term. And I also think it's so funny because I'm on the Know Your Meme page of unserious right now
[00:01:07.860] 但当有人表现得不认真的时候，这个词就概括了很多内容，而且又不会显得过于尖锐。我觉得这也很搞笑，因为我现在正在浏览Know Your Meme网站上关于“不认真”的页面。
[00:01:19.860] and this is a vintage word. It says the earliest documented use of the adjective unserious is the writing of the first earl of orrery from 1655. This word is older than us. Yeah it's literally older than America.
[00:01:19.860] 这是一个古老的词。据记载，形容词 unserious 最早的使用记录出现在 1655 年第一代奥雷里伯爵的著作中。这个词比我们人类的历史还要悠久。没错，它甚至比美国的历史还要悠久。
[00:01:39.140] Okay I'm not gonna lie, I didn't even realize it was a real word at first. I thought it was just like we added a random prefix to serious. That's a fair guess. Although
[00:01:39.140] 好吧，说实话，我一开始都没意识到它是个真词。我以为只是在“serious”前面加了个随机前缀。这倒也说得通。虽然
[00:01:50.820] I also think that it's not necessarily always silly in like a funny haha way. I feel like it could also be used in a semi-ironic way so some of the examples I see on the page are like criticism
[00:01:50.820] 我也觉得它不一定总是那种让人哈哈大笑的傻气。我觉得它也可以半讽刺地使用，所以我在页面上看到的一些例子更像是批评。
[00:02:02.820] of the US government. It's like the United States is such an unserious country because of these laws that they pass and I'm like yeah that's a fair word for it too. Yeah you're right it's not always
[00:02:02.820] 美国政府。感觉美国因为这些法律而显得很不靠谱，我觉得用这个词形容也挺贴切的。是啊，你说得对，并非总是如此。
[00:02:12.660] just in a funny context. Along similar lines, I think it's sometimes used to call out behaviors too. One funny example I can think of, a celebrity or someone with some like media attention
[00:02:12.660] 只是在搞笑的语境下。类似地，我觉得它有时也用来指代某些行为。我能想到的一个有趣的例子，就是名人或者一些受到媒体关注的人。
[00:02:25.300] does something that's I don't know maybe not the smartest thing or it's like unbelievable that they did this. Sometimes the comments are like that's so unserious of them to do that. True. That reminds
[00:02:25.300] 他们做了一些我不知道该怎么说的事情，也许不是最明智的做法，或者简直令人难以置信。有时评论会说他们这样做太不严肃了。确实如此。这让我想起了……
[00:02:36.420] me of when Doja Cat tossed her vape while she was walking onto the stage of the Grammys or something and everyone was like oh my god Doja is so unserious. Yeah. So I think based on what we're
[00:02:36.420] 我记得Doja Cat在格莱美颁奖典礼上走上舞台的时候把电子烟扔了，然后大家都说“我的天哪，Doja也太不认真了吧”。是啊。所以我觉得基于我们……
[00:02:46.740] talking about this word is so applicable to a lot of different situations and it's like a pretty flexible word. So for me I think unserious is maybe like a top five slang word of this year.
[00:02:46.740] 这个词的适用范围非常广，可以应用于很多不同的情境，而且它本身也是一个非常灵活的词。所以我觉得“unserious”可能是今年最热门的五个俚语之一。
[00:03:00.580] Ooh dude I feel like it's so good that it like kind of went under my radar as in like it was so normal to see it and like use it. Yeah. So when you brought it up you're like oh maybe we do
[00:03:00.580] 哦，老兄，我觉得它太好了，以至于我都没怎么注意到，就像看到它、用它都觉得很平常一样。是啊。所以当你提起它的时候，我就会想，哦，也许我们确实……
[00:03:12.260] unserious as a word. I was like oh my god you're right that is technically kind of slang. True. So I would agree it's definitely like a top slang word. It instantly became a classic. Oh my god
[00:03:12.260] “unserious”这个词本身就很不正经。我当时就想，我的天哪，你说得对，这严格来说确实算是俚语。没错。所以我同意它绝对是最流行的俚语之一。它瞬间就成了经典。我的天哪
[00:03:23.780] that's how you know it's good. Well enough unserious business. Our topic today is one that I find pretty interesting. So we actually found this New York Times article called the vexing problem of the medium friend and we read it and thought it was very interesting some of the
[00:03:23.780] 这就是判断它好坏的标准。好了，闲话少说。我们今天的话题我觉得很有意思。我们找到了一篇《纽约时报》的文章，叫做《令人头疼的“朋友”问题》，读完之后觉得很有意思，其中一些内容……
[00:03:43.060] concepts that the article covered and so we thought it would be fun to discuss especially this idea of the medium friend because I think that's the newest concept within this article.
[00:03:43.060] 这篇文章涵盖了一些概念，所以我们觉得讨论一下会很有趣，特别是关于“媒介朋友”这个概念，因为我认为这是这篇文章中最新的概念。
[00:03:54.340] So to start off I guess we should define what the article says is a medium friend. So I'm gonna read snippets of the blurb in the article that defines a medium friend where it says that medium friends
[00:03:54.340] 首先，我想我们应该先定义一下文章中所说的“中等朋友”是什么意思。接下来，我将朗读文章中关于“中等朋友”定义的部分内容，其中提到中等朋友……
[00:04:06.340] are genuine friends so you might have certain shared experiences, history, circumstances, hobbies, etc. You feel a lot of joy when you're hanging around with them through the conversations that you have, the jokes you might share, etc. But what separates medium friends from your closest friends
[00:04:06.340] 他们是真正的朋友，所以你们可能有一些共同的经历、过往、境遇、爱好等等。和他们在一起的时候，你会因为聊天、开玩笑等等而感到非常快乐。但是，是什么把普通朋友和最亲密的朋友区分开来呢？
[00:04:23.940] is that there seems to be more of a limit in terms of the time that you feel comfortable with or even want to spend with them and similarly you have a specific amount of love and energy that's allotted
[00:04:23.940] 似乎你与他们相处的时间是有限制的，你愿意或能够与他们相处的时间也是如此；同样，你分配给他们的爱和精力也是有限的。
[00:04:37.300] for these friends whereas with close friends it might seem a little bit more natural and overflowing. So really you can see a medium friend as someone who you're totally down to grab dinner with
[00:04:37.300] 对于这些朋友来说，这种程度的交流可能比和亲密朋友之间的交流更自然、更融洽。所以，你可以把“中等朋友”看作是那种你完全可以一起吃顿饭的人。
[00:04:48.580] and text back and forth with but maybe not every single day. And I think another big point that the article said was that medium friends it requires more effort for you to be like okay I have to like
[00:04:48.580] 你们会互发短信，但可能不会每天都发。我觉得文章里提到的另一个重点是，和中等好友保持联系需要你付出更多努力，比如你会想“好吧，我得点赞了”。
[00:05:02.580] schedule this now with them, you know, whether it's a dinner or a catch-up and it feels like much more effort than say a close friend where you're like oh yeah like I'll fit you in no matter what. Or your
[00:05:02.580] 现在就和他们安排一下，你知道，不管是吃顿饭还是叙叙旧，感觉比和好朋友见面要费劲得多，因为和好朋友见面，你会觉得“哦，好的，不管怎样我都会抽空陪你”。或者你的
[00:05:15.860] time available has already been like reserved kind of like oh if people were to ask to hang out during this time I already know that I would say yes if they were like these people. So I thought it was
[00:05:15.860] 空闲时间已经被预留出来了，就像是，如果有人想在这个时间段出去玩，我知道如果他们是像这些人一样的人，我会答应的。所以我认为……
[00:05:27.700] pretty interesting to think about like the level of mental effort it takes and that can be like a sign of a medium friend. Yeah it's super interesting because I think this is something that we all
[00:05:27.700] 想想这很有意思，比如这需要付出多少心力，这或许可以算作是通灵朋友的一个特征。是啊，这真的很有意思，因为我觉得这是我们所有人都会思考的问题。
[00:05:40.580] experience to a certain extent but it's so jarring reading about it kind of spelled out for me in an article because no one wants to say like oh I have different tiers of friends right like it feels
[00:05:40.580] 我在某种程度上也有过类似的经历，但读到文章里这样描述还是让我感觉很不舒服，因为没人愿意承认自己有不同层次的朋友，对吧？
[00:05:53.300] so fucked up to even think that. But I think the reality is energy or time like these are limited resources that just get smaller and smaller as you grow older and have more responsibilities so then
[00:05:53.300] 想到这一点就觉得糟透了。但我认为现实是，精力和时间之类的资源是有限的，随着年龄增长和责任加重，这些资源只会越来越少。
[00:06:05.140] I think it is totally fair to kind of sit down and look at it. And one thing that the article points out really well is that with medium friends there's like these invisible lines right like these
[00:06:05.140] 我觉得坐下来仔细看看这件事完全合情合理。这篇文章指出的一点非常好，那就是中等程度的朋友之间就像存在一些看不见的界限，就像这样。
[00:06:15.460] invisible guidelines where you're like oh I want to see them less than x number of times a month or like maybe not so much explicitly but there seems to be some sort of gray area or like invisible
[00:06:15.460] 存在一些看不见的规则，比如你想让它们每月出现少于 x 次，或者也许不需要明确规定，但似乎存在某种灰色地带或看不见的界限。
[00:06:24.980] limit. And the article says that these things might be invisible to your friend so they might not know how close you see them but it also might be invisible to you so like you yourself might not
[00:06:24.980] 限制。文章说，这些事情对你的朋友来说可能是看不见的，所以他们可能不知道你和他们有多亲近；但对你来说也可能是看不见的，所以你自己可能也不知道。
[00:06:38.820] even be able to sit down and define these feelings but you just kind of get that like gut feeling that might be a little bit harder to define. This one part of the article also really stuck out to me
[00:06:38.820] 甚至无法坐下来仔细描述这些感受，你只会有一种直觉，一种难以言喻的感觉。文章的这一部分也让我印象深刻。
[00:06:50.820] kind of like you were saying like it's hard to define these things they're saying like we don't really define our friends but we have a million words to describe like a situation ship or a
[00:06:50.820] 就像你刚才说的，这些东西很难定义，他们说的好像我们不会真正定义朋友，但我们却有无数个词来描述，比如“关系”、“船”或者“……”
[00:06:59.780] relationship you know all the like romantic connections we have so many words to describe them but friends it's just like oh they're my friend and you don't know like what level that is.
[00:06:59.780] 你知道，像恋爱关系之类的，我们有很多词来形容它们，但是朋友，就好像“哦，他们是我的朋友”，你不知道那是什么程度。
[00:07:10.420] Yeah it kind of reminds me of you know sometimes you go to a more formal event or something a wedding for example right and you're meeting all these people who have a mutual friend with you
[00:07:10.420] 是啊，这让我想起有时候你去参加比较正式的活动，比如婚礼之类的，然后你会遇到很多人，而这些人跟你都有共同的朋友。
[00:07:20.900] but you kind of do that quintessential question of oh how do you know this person? Sometimes it's like very easy to be like oh like we are close friends or like we met through this or whatever
[00:07:20.900] 但你总会问那个很经典的问题：你是怎么认识这个人的？有时候很容易回答，比如“我们是好朋友”或者“我们通过这个认识的”之类的。
[00:07:30.820] and then other times if it's been like a long time since you've seen that person or whatever it might feel a little bit more unnatural to like define your relationship with that person.
[00:07:30.820] 而有时候，如果你很久没见到那个人了，或者其他什么原因，那么定义你和那个人的关系可能会感觉有点不自然。
[00:07:40.660] Yeah and I feel like that totally points to like yeah there's just less vocab. How do you define for example someone who you every time you hang out with you have such a great time but you see
[00:07:40.660] 是啊，我觉得这完全说明词汇量确实少了。比如说，你怎么形容那种每次和你一起玩都很开心，但你又觉得……的人呢？
[00:07:50.260] them like once every two years like what do you is that person a close friend? Oh my god I don't even know. They're a situation ship. Yeah true. I think also I feel like friend is such a generic term
[00:07:50.260] 他们大概每两年见一次面，你觉得这个人算是好朋友吗？我的天，我都不知道。他们之间就是暧昧关系。对，确实。而且我觉得“朋友”这个词太笼统了。
[00:08:07.780] in that there's so many times where we're sharing stories with each other and we're like oh yeah I have a friend who like does this blah blah but then there's definitely moments where I start off
[00:08:07.780] 因为有很多时候我们会互相分享故事，我们会说，哦，我有个朋友会做这个做那个，但肯定也有一些时候，我一开始……
[00:08:16.980] like oh yeah I have a friend they do this they did that and then I'm like wait actually they're not really my friend they're just kind of like an acquaintance I guess. I don't know why I just
[00:08:16.980] 比如，哦，我有个朋友，他们做了这个，做了那个，然后我就想，等等，其实他们不算我真正的朋友，他们只是个熟人而已。我也不知道为什么，我就是这么想的。
[00:08:25.700] defaulted to calling them a friend. It's like the catch-all keyword. Yeah exactly. Well I am kind of interested to know like what sort of niche situations or relationships you would categorize
[00:08:25.700] 默认称呼他们为朋友。这就像个万能词。没错。嗯，我很想知道你会把哪些特殊情况或关系归类为朋友。
[00:08:39.620] as a medium friend. So the example that I mentioned earlier where every time you see this friend it's like the most fun you've ever had but you truly do see them like once every two years. Would you
[00:08:39.620] 就像那种中等程度的朋友。比如我之前提到的例子，每次见到这位朋友都感觉无比开心，但实际上你们可能两年才见一次。你会愿意吗？
[00:08:50.500] consider this person a close friend, a medium friend, or an acquaintance? Dude I was really thinking about this when I was reading the article too because I think I have some friends who I would
[00:08:50.500] 你会把这个人看作是挚友、普通朋友还是熟人？兄弟，我读这篇文章的时候也在想这个问题，因为我觉得我有些朋友……
[00:09:02.820] consider close friends but I don't see them that much because of like you know physical distance and then also maybe we don't text that much just because like we're busy with our own lives
[00:09:02.820] 我把他们算作亲密的朋友，但因为距离的原因，我并不经常见到他们。而且，我们可能也不经常发短信，因为我们都忙于各自的生活。
[00:09:14.500] and usually we're busiest with the people who are physically closest to us and or maybe we're just not big on texting in general. There's nothing wrong with that whenever we see each other it's all totally good and it doesn't necessarily feel like there's that extra effort that you're
[00:09:14.500] 通常我们最忙的时候都和离我们最近的人在一起，或者我们本来就不太喜欢发短信。这没什么不好，每次见面都很愉快，也不会觉得需要额外付出什么努力。
[00:09:31.460] going through like oh my god I have to like make time for these people or that kind of stuff so I think under certain circumstances these are still close friends. Wait actually I totally agree
[00:09:31.460] 有时候会想，天哪，我得抽出时间来陪这些人，或者诸如此类的事情，所以我觉得在某些情况下，他们仍然是好朋友。等等，其实我完全同意。
[00:09:44.980] I feel like if in the moments you're together you pick back up like no time has passed I would say you qualify as a close friend although I feel like I've had moments where I was like humbled in the
[00:09:44.980] 我觉得，如果你们在一起的时候，彼此之间就像时间从未流逝一样，那我就会认为你算得上是我的挚友。虽然我也曾有过一些让我感到惭愧的时刻。
[00:09:55.780] past where I'm like oh I see this person not too often but every time we hang out we're like so close or whatever so I always consider them a close friend and then you find out like big life
[00:09:55.780] 过了那种程度，我就觉得“哦，我虽然不常见到这个人，但每次见面都特别亲密，所以我一直把他们当成好朋友”，然后你就会发现，人生发生了翻天覆地的变化。
[00:10:05.060] announcements through Instagram or something and I'm like oh maybe I'm not as close as I thought we were. Like I don't know like I think also defining this stuff like closeness to me is also a little
[00:10:05.060] 通过Instagram之类的平台发布消息，我就想，哦，也许我们之间的关系并没有我想象的那么亲密。我也不知道，我觉得定义亲密关系这种东西对我来说也有点……
[00:10:15.140] bit relative. I think there is maybe like a threshold too in terms of these people that you don't see that often maybe like after a certain number of years pass and you haven't seen each
[00:10:15.140] 这有点相对而言。我觉得对于这些不常见面的人来说，可能也存在一个阈值，比如过了一定年限，你都没见过他们。
[00:10:29.940] other then it's like a quiet demotion almost. Damn. Just because of like the nature of things like you haven't seen them so you know you haven't had a chance to catch up and learn about their
[00:10:29.940] 除此之外，这几乎就像一次悄无声息的降职。真可惜。就因为事情的性质，比如你没见过他们，所以你知道你没有机会了解他们的近况。
[00:10:42.980] big life milestones because of that distance between you just grows ever so slightly every time and then eventually it causes what could potentially be seen as like a demotion of friendship but I feel like after that if you like hang out again and then you're able to
[00:10:42.980] 因为距离的原因，你们之间在人生重大里程碑事件发生时，距离会一次次地拉大，最终导致友谊似乎有所降级。但我觉得，在那之后，如果你愿意再次见面，你们就能……
[00:11:00.420] you know bring things back up to speed and then maybe like have a more regular cadence again then maybe you can find yourself back into the original position. That's true. I feel like a lot
[00:11:00.420] 你知道，先把事情恢复到正常节奏，然后也许就能重新建立起规律的节奏，这样或许就能回到最初的状态。确实如此。我觉得很多
[00:11:13.300] of what I've been trying to unlearn in my mid-20s is to me like friendship when I was younger was very much like myspace top eight. You have top friends who are your close friends and then people
[00:11:13.300] 我二十五六岁的时候一直在努力摒弃的一点是，我年轻时的友谊对我来说就像MySpace上的“八强好友”一样。你有一些铁哥们，他们是你的挚友，然后还有一些人……
[00:11:26.820] who don't fit into that ranking are your medium friends and then etc etc and then I feel like in my adulthood I realized that it doesn't always have to be like a pyramid or like a hierarchy you
[00:11:26.820] 那些不符合这种等级划分的人就是你的中等朋友，等等等等。然后我觉得，成年后我意识到，人际关系不一定非得像金字塔或等级制度那样。
[00:11:37.940] know like you could have your pickleball friends and you can have friends you play board games with you know different kind of friends for different situations and you don't have to rank it and I feel
[00:11:37.940] 比如，你可以有一起打匹克球的朋友，也可以有一起玩桌游的朋友，不同类型的朋友适合不同的场合，你不需要给他们排名，我觉得
[00:11:46.580] like I spent a lot of effort into thinking that way but then after reading this article I was like damn this article is kind of right there is still sort of in hierarchy you know mentally. Yeah
[00:11:46.580] 我之前花了很多心思去想这个问题，但读了这篇文章之后，我觉得这篇文章说的也有道理，思维里仍然存在某种等级制度。是的。
[00:11:58.900] I think it's inevitable and I think as we mentioned distance physical distance is a big factor because it's hard to keep up with a long distance friend let alone like a long distance
[00:11:58.900] 我认为这是不可避免的，而且正如我们之前提到的，距离，尤其是物理距离，是一个很大的因素，因为要和远距离的朋友保持联系已经很困难了，更别说喜欢远距离的朋友了。
[00:12:11.700] partner. A lot of people are always like oh long distance doesn't work out and there's like a reason or whatever and so I think the same can be applicable to friendships in that it's inevitable
[00:12:11.700] 伴侣关系。很多人总是说异地恋行不通，好像总有原因似的，所以我觉得同样的道理也适用于友谊，这是不可避免的。
[00:12:22.980] that distance over a long period of time will cause some metaphorical distance as well. And I think distance is a good word for it too because sometimes it is like physical distance but other times you might just be feeling a little bit more emotionally distant from someone
[00:12:22.980] 长时间的距离也会造成某种程度的心理距离。我觉得用“距离”这个词很贴切，因为有时是物理上的距离，有时则可能只是情感上的疏离。
[00:12:40.820] whether you're in different life stages or you're just so busy caught up in your own shit they are too and then sometimes time just passes in between so I think what you said about friendship
[00:12:40.820] 不管你们处于不同的人生阶段，还是你们忙于处理自己的琐事，他们也一样，有时候时间就这样悄然流逝，所以我认为你说的关于友谊的话很有道理。
[00:12:52.100] demotions just do happen naturally sometimes. And I think that's a really interesting concept too something that I never even thought about but then when we put it into words you know the demotion and promotion of friends it's actually so true because like you said if you're entering
[00:12:52.100] 降职有时确实会自然而然地发生。我觉得这真是一个很有意思的概念，我以前从来没想过，但当我们用语言来描述朋友间的降职和晋升时，你会发现这其实非常真实，因为就像你说的，如果你进入……
[00:13:07.700] a new life stage let's say like one of the most basic different life stages that people can experience is going from being single to being in a relationship or the vice versa like going from
[00:13:07.700] 人生新阶段，比如说，人们经历的最基本的人生阶段之一就是从单身到恋爱，或者反之亦然。
[00:13:19.460] in a relationship to being single and I do think that causes a lot of friend shifts because you know if you're now in a relationship maybe you hang out with more people who are also in relationships
[00:13:19.460] 从恋爱到单身，我认为这确实会导致很多朋友圈的变化，因为你知道，如果你现在恋爱了，你可能会和更多恋爱中的人一起玩。
[00:13:33.380] just because that world is now more open to you versus before maybe you like didn't want to be the only single one in a group of couples and stuff like that or if you're you know going from
[00:13:33.380] 仅仅因为这个世界现在对你更加开放，也许你不想成为一群情侣中唯一的单身人士，或者你知道，如果你正从
[00:13:43.700] your like relationship stage into a single stage maybe the whole world opens up more to you now and you're like oh my god there are some friends I did neglect and now I have space and time for them
[00:13:43.700] 就像你的恋爱关系从一段阶段过渡到单身阶段，也许整个世界都向你敞开了大门，你会想：天哪，我之前忽略了一些朋友，现在我有时间和空间陪伴他们了。
[00:13:55.140] and so then there's definitely some shift there as well. Yeah I guess it just kind of goes with like the natural pace and flow of life almost it's like friendships are definitely a big aspect of life
[00:13:55.140] 所以，这方面肯定也发生了一些变化。是啊，我觉得这几乎就是顺应生活的自然节奏和走向，友谊无疑是生活中非常重要的一部分。
[00:14:06.900] but it also in some ways has to remain complementary to other aspects of life. I feel like it's not a solid brick wall that is not changing when every other aspect is so maybe it's not this whole dramatic emotional finger pointing thing when friendships change. Oftentimes it's just
[00:14:06.900] 但从某种程度上来说，它也必须与生活的其他方面保持互补。我觉得它不是一堵坚不可摧的砖墙，不会随着其他方面的变化而改变，所以当友谊发生变化时，也许不应该出现那种戏剧化的情绪化指责。很多时候，它只是……
[00:14:25.940] we're taking a short break and we'll be back later when our lives are more meshed together or when we're living closer together and things like that but I feel like in the moment it still feels
[00:14:25.940] 我们打算短暂休息一下，等彼此的生活更加融合，或者住得更近一些的时候，我们会再回来。但我觉得，就目前而言，这种感觉依然存在。
[00:14:35.140] very weird right like it still feels uncomfortable. Yeah and I feel like there's this whole thing about friends who aren't your close friends so medium friends, acquaintances, any of those where and I'm
[00:14:35.140] 感觉很奇怪，现在想起来还是觉得不自在。是啊，我觉得这跟朋友之间的关系有点矛盾，比如不太熟的朋友、泛泛之交、熟人等等，而我……
[00:14:46.980] guilty of this too like maybe you hold some guilt almost for being like oh my god should I reach out to them? Like we haven't hung in a long time maybe it's my fault I really should you know reach out
[00:14:46.980] 我也犯过这种错，可能你会因为心里想“天哪，我该联系他们吗？”而感到内疚。我们很久没见面了，也许是我的错，我真的应该主动联系他们。
[00:14:59.140] and ask if they want to hang out and I think that's like totally fair but also I try to remind myself when I think about things in that way that hey it's okay like you don't have to feel guilty about
[00:14:59.140] 然后问问他们想不想一起出去玩，我觉得这完全没问题。但我也会提醒自己，当我这样想的时候，没关系，你不必为此感到内疚。
[00:15:09.860] it because if you think about on the flip side that person also didn't reach out to you so you shouldn't carry the full burden of this like guilt or feeling bad feeling you know there's definitely
[00:15:09.860] 因为如果你换个角度想，那个人也没有主动联系你，所以你不应该独自承担所有的负担，比如内疚或难过的感觉。你知道，肯定有这样的情况。
[00:15:23.220] something mutual going on there like maybe you were once really close but now you've both quietly been demoted in each other's circles. That's true and I think I'm definitely guilty of that too
[00:15:23.220] 你们之间肯定发生了一些事，比如你们曾经很亲密，但现在你们在彼此的圈子里都悄悄地被边缘化了。确实如此，我想我在这方面也肯定有错。
[00:15:35.460] and what I try to remember as well is like when friendships are led forward by guilt I feel like it just does not provide like a strong foundation for that friendship to continue. If the only reason
[00:15:35.460] 我努力记住的一点是，如果友谊是由愧疚感维系的，我觉得它无法为友谊的延续提供坚实的基础。如果唯一的理由是……
[00:15:50.500] why you're hitting someone up is because you feel guilty that it's been a long time you're going to show up to that hangout like feeling guilty you know what I mean? Yeah and then that just like
[00:15:50.500] 你之所以联系某人，是因为你感到内疚，因为很久没见面了，所以你打算去参加那个聚会，感觉很内疚，你懂我的意思吗？是啊，然后就像……
[00:16:00.180] starts the hangout with weird vibes but I feel like you instead of focusing on the guilt maybe want to focus on like oh I miss this person because of these positive traits or I know we
[00:16:00.180] 聚会开始时气氛有点怪异，但我感觉你与其纠结于内疚，不如想想“哦，我怀念这个人是因为他/她身上这些美好的品质”，或者“我知道我们……”
[00:16:09.300] always have fun when we do x y and z or we always talk about this and connect so maybe just indulging in that guilt in the first place can also just be detrimental. Yeah I never thought about that but
[00:16:09.300] 我们做x、y、z的时候总是很开心，或者我们总是谈论这些事情，彼此之间也很有共鸣，所以也许一开始就沉溺于这种内疚感反而会有害。是啊，我以前从没想过这一点。
[00:16:18.740] that's a really good point like you shouldn't rely on guilt to drive your friendship. Actually this also does remind me of something that the article does a good job of pointing out which is I think a
[00:16:18.740] 你说的很有道理，你不应该依靠愧疚感来维系友谊。实际上，这让我想起了文章中提到的一点，我认为……
[00:16:29.140] lot of the times guilt comes from that ambiguity. Oh I see my friend as either a close friend or a medium friend but does my friend see me the same way? Are we matching and on the same wavelength
[00:16:29.140] 很多时候，内疚感就源于这种模糊不清的关系。我把朋友看作是知己或普通朋友，但我的朋友也这样看待我吗？我们是否合拍，是否步调一致？
[00:16:41.300] or are we kind of like playing in different fields here? And I think not being on the same page can either cause a lot of guilt or maybe just discomfort in general. What if I'm the one who cares more
[00:16:41.300] 或者我们其实是在不同的领域里摸索？我觉得意见不一致可能会让人感到内疚，或者只是单纯的不舒服。万一我更在意呢？
[00:16:54.500] about our friendship or vice versa like am I not putting enough into this friendship? Yeah I guess there's just like way more possibility of not being on the same page just because on average you'll have more friends than like say for example romantic partners. We don't explicitly
[00:16:54.500] 关于我们的友谊，或者反过来，比如我是否在这段友谊中投入了足够的精力？是的，我想，因为一般来说，朋友的数量会比伴侣的数量多得多，所以彼此想法不一致的可能性也更大。我们不会明确地表达这种想法。
[00:17:12.500] define friendship because as we said we don't even necessarily have the vocabulary. We've done episodes about like DTR right like defining the relationship for a romantic relationship but if you think about it we don't just DTR for friendship and I think there's like that fear of maybe it's
[00:17:12.500] 给友谊下定义，因为正如我们所说，我们甚至不一定有足够的词汇来描述它。我们做过一些关于“确定关系”（DTR）的节目，比如定义恋爱关系，但如果你仔细想想，我们并不会仅仅因为是恋爱关系就去确定关系，我认为其中存在一种恐惧，那就是也许……
[00:17:32.020] like offensive if I told someone like oh you're not my best friend but you're like still a good friend. Whoa that's such a good point and I guess there's just a lot more reassurance right
[00:17:32.020] 如果我跟别人说“哦，你不是我最好的朋友，但你仍然是个好朋友”，这听起来会不会有点冒犯？哇，你说的太对了，我觉得这样确实能让人安心很多，对吧？
[00:17:44.340] when you have a romantic partner assuming that they're not like cheating on you or something. You're their number one and vice versa it's like you are my only partner but with friends you are
[00:17:44.340] 当你和伴侣恋爱时，前提是他们不会背叛你之类的。你是他们最重要的人，反之亦然，就像你是我的唯一伴侣一样。但和朋友在一起时，情况就不同了。
[00:17:55.940] probably never someone's like only friend which means you also don't know how high you rank or how low you rank. You're right like that culture of DTR is just not baked into friendship so honestly like ambiguity is probably just completely normal but I think there's just times where
[00:17:55.940] 可能永远不会有人是你唯一的朋友，这意味着你也不知道自己在对方心中的地位高低。你说得对，那种“确定关系”的文化并没有根深蒂固地融入友谊之中，所以说实话，这种暧昧不清的状态可能完全正常，但我认为有些时候……
[00:18:14.020] you can sense that mismatch and I feel like I've been on both sides. I don't know what the solution would be because I also think sitting down and like DTRing your friendship and being
[00:18:14.020] 你能感觉到这种不协调，我觉得自己两种情况都经历过。我不知道解决办法是什么，因为我觉得坐下来好好谈谈，确定一下你们的友谊关系，也是个办法。
[00:18:24.500] like hey you're my like fourth favorite friend is also just like that would not be productive like it would help no one you know. Yeah in that situation the best thing that you can do is try
[00:18:24.500] 比如，说“嘿，你是我第四喜欢的朋友”之类的，其实没什么用，对谁都没好处。在这种情况下，你能做的最好的事情就是尝试
[00:18:39.620] to recognize it for yourself like oh maybe I'm putting in more effort than is needed for this friendship so maybe I should see if I can put these efforts towards something or someone else.
[00:18:39.620] 要学会自我反思，比如，也许我在这段友谊上投入了过多的精力，也许我应该看看能不能把这些精力投入到其他事情或其他人身上。
[00:18:56.340] I mean of course like that's all easier said than done but I do think that's at least like an actionable thing that can happen because also at the same time you don't want to let yourself get
[00:18:56.340] 当然，说起来容易做起来难，但我认为这至少是可以采取的行动，因为与此同时，你也不想让自己陷入困境。
[00:19:05.380] taken advantage by you know other people just because you are giving up so much like time and effort when other people are clearly not on the same page. I agree and I think maybe the other
[00:19:05.380] 你被其他人利用了，仅仅因为你投入了大量的时间和精力，而其他人显然并不认同你的想法。我同意，而且我认为也许其他人也是如此。
[00:19:17.140] thing that could help too is focus on what you yourself are getting out of the friendship instead of worrying if you guys are like exactly meeting at the same point because if you're still getting
[00:19:17.140] 另一个有帮助的方法是，专注于你从这段友谊中获得了什么，而不是担心你们是否完全同步。因为如果你仍然有所收获，那么这段友谊对你来说意义非凡。
[00:19:28.980] a lot of joy out of this friendship maybe it doesn't matter so much that you guys are like exactly the same level or like exactly the same amount of expectations like as long as you're
[00:19:28.980] 这段友谊带来了很多快乐，也许你们的水平是否完全相同，或者期望值是否完全一致，都并不那么重要，只要你们……
[00:19:38.420] still deriving joy and like fulfillment from this friendship maybe that's all that matters in the end. That's true like as long as everyone is still happy feeling fulfilled the friendship is still
[00:19:38.420] 仍然能从这段友谊中获得快乐和满足感，也许最终这才是最重要的。的确如此，只要每个人都感到快乐和满足，这段友谊就依然存在。
[00:19:50.980] thriving things are good don't fix what's not broken. True. But I do think there is sort of DTR in friendships and it's all very specific situations so one I think if you have reached
[00:19:50.980] 蓬勃发展的事物是好事，没坏的东西就别修。没错。但我确实认为友谊中存在某种程度的确定性，而且这都取决于具体情况，所以我认为，如果你已经达到某个阶段，那就没必要再去改变它了。
[00:20:05.700] best friend level with someone it is very easy to DTR then especially I think when you're younger in like school or someone who you see consistently every single day. I mean funny story I feel like
[00:20:05.700] 和某人成为最好的朋友之后，很容易发展成恋爱关系，尤其是我觉得当你还年轻，比如在学校或者每天都能见到的人。说起来挺有意思的，我觉得
[00:20:19.940] when we were living together in college there was this one night where we had like some friends over and then I think me you and Jessica were in the kitchen at one point and we were like oh my god I
[00:20:19.940] 大学时我们合租的时候，有天晚上我们请了一些朋友来家里玩，然后我记得你和杰西卡当时在厨房，我们俩突然都惊呼：“我的天哪！”
[00:20:30.900] think we're best friends or something like that which I think is like probably one of the only moments of like DTRing for friendships and then another moment I would say also very specific
[00:20:30.900] 我觉得我们是最好的朋友之类的，这大概是我为数不多的几次真正确定友谊关系的时刻之一，然后还有另一个时刻，我觉得也很具体。
[00:20:45.380] is like bridal parties. I think these are kind of like hey I just want to let you know like you're a really important friend to me so like it's not a straight up like DTR but it's kind of a like a
[00:20:45.380] 就像伴娘伴郎一样。我觉得这有点像是在说“嘿，我只是想让你知道，你对我来说是一位非常重要的朋友”，所以这不算是直接的“确定关系”，但有点像……
[00:20:58.420] signal hey like you're a really good friend I hope you accept and know that please be like a part of my bridal party. Yeah that's a really good point and I think also maybe the term like best friend
[00:20:58.420] 就像邀请你做我的好朋友一样，我希望你能接受，并且知道请你成为我婚礼的伴娘。嗯，你说得很有道理，我觉得用“最好的朋友”这个词也挺合适的。
[00:21:10.660] is also a little bit less weighted now than when we were younger because I feel like in middle school best friendship was like the thing you know it was like so important like I would know
[00:21:10.660] 现在友谊的重要性也比我们小时候低了一些，因为我觉得在中学时期，最好的友谊就像是非常重要的事情，你知道，就像我知道……
[00:21:21.780] who everyone's best friend was at school like it was that big of a deal but now I feel like so many friends are like so special to each of us in different ways so then maybe best friendship
[00:21:21.780] 以前在学校里，好像每个人都觉得自己最好的朋友很重要似的。但现在我觉得，很多朋友对我们每个人来说都很特别，各有各的意义。所以，也许“最好的朋友”这个词本身就有点儿过了。
[00:21:32.740] carries a little bit less gravity slash like exclusivity almost but something that I think is a little bit funny is I feel like I could still kind of tell who people's like best friends are.
[00:21:32.740] 虽然少了些许引力/排他性，但我觉得有点好笑的是，我感觉我仍然能分辨出谁是别人的挚友。
[00:21:45.140] Yeah I guess now it's like more complicated because I feel like sometimes there's like a lot of history so people are like best friends because of that but maybe not like best best friends do
[00:21:45.140] 是啊，我觉得现在情况更复杂了，因为我觉得有时候彼此之间有很多过往，所以有些人会因为这些过往成为最好的朋友，但也许不是那种真正的挚友。
[00:21:56.980] you know what I mean? Yeah. And then sometimes it's like oh they connected recently because of something they both like really feel strongly about or like a shared experience and then that has caused
[00:21:56.980] 你明白我的意思吗？嗯。有时候，他们会因为一些共同的爱好或经历而最近联系上，然后就导致了这种情况。
[00:22:09.220] their friendship to like elevate all the way to like best friendship. You're definitely right where the weight of this best friend label has kind of changed but you're right it is definitely easy
[00:22:09.220] 他们的友谊一路提升，最终变成了最好的朋友。你说的没错，这个“最好的朋友”这个标签的意义确实发生了变化，但你说得对，这确实很容易。
[00:22:19.860] sometimes to see like oh you know these two are like definitely best buddies. Yeah I feel like when you watch two people talk and engage with each other I feel like you can kind of tell instantly
[00:22:19.860] 有时候看一眼就会觉得，哦，这两个人绝对是最好的朋友。是啊，我觉得当你观察两个人交谈互动的时候，你一眼就能看出来。
[00:22:30.820] maybe it's like the contrast too like watching someone talk to one of their best friends and then like watching them talk to someone who's not their best friend you're like oh I can I can kind of
[00:22:30.820] 或许也像对比一样，就像看着一个人和最好的朋友聊天，然后再看着他和不太熟的人聊天，你会想，哦，我也可以，我也可以。
[00:22:39.060] visually see this. Yeah but besides being like best friends and stuff have you ever had a moment where you knew in your heart you're like you know what I'm actually not this person's best friend I'm like
[00:22:39.060] 能直观地看到这一点。是啊，但除了像最好的朋友那样之外，你有没有过这样的时刻：你内心深处知道，你知道吗，我其实并不是这个人最好的朋友，我就像……
[00:22:51.860] definitely a medium friend or something along those lines. Yeah I've definitely been there and I think I'm lucky to where most of my experiences like this they weren't like super emotional or painful for me because it was probably mutual in some sense okay low-key like copium but
[00:22:51.860] 绝对是那种关系比较微妙的朋友，或者类似的东西。是的，我肯定有过类似的经历，我觉得自己很幸运，因为我的大多数类似经历对我来说都不算特别情绪化或痛苦，因为这可能是某种程度上的相互的，好吧，有点像服用安眠药那样低调。
[00:23:10.580] probably somewhat mutual but recently someone who I see fairly often got engaged I like saw it on Instagram and actually my friend told me that he was going to propose because we're like in the
[00:23:10.580] 可能有点相互的，但最近我经常见到的一个人订婚了，我是从Instagram上看到的，实际上我的朋友告诉我他打算向我求婚，因为我们关系很好。
[00:23:24.660] same friend group or whatever but I was just like dude what the fuck like if my friend didn't tell me I would have found on Instagram and I think I actually like would have been a little bit sad.
[00:23:24.660] 虽然是同一个朋友圈之类的，但我当时就想，老兄，这他妈什么情况？如果我朋友没告诉我，我会在 Instagram 上看到，我觉得我可能真的会有点难过。
[00:23:34.100] Oh yeah I feel like sometimes it's tough to find out news through social media when you're like wait I'm pretty sure we're like good friends. Yeah I was like wait what the fuck. I think the best
[00:23:34.100] 哦，是啊，我觉得有时候通过社交媒体了解消息挺难受的，比如你会想，等等，我明明觉得我们是好朋友啊。是啊，我当时就想，卧槽，这到底是怎么回事？我觉得最好的办法是……
[00:23:48.900] situation though is like if you can clearly tell that one of your friends has one or two other best friends and you're like oh yeah I'm clearly just a good friend to them and then same for them
[00:23:48.900] 这种情况就像，如果你能明显看出你的某个朋友还有一两个特别要好的朋友，你会想，哦，对啊，我显然只是他们的好朋友，然后他们也一样。
[00:24:01.940] to me. That's true. Sometimes I also think too is it okay sorry this is getting into like petty territory but this is just what my brain does you know like I was reading this article and I was
[00:24:01.940] 对我来说，确实如此。有时候我也会想，这样可以吗？抱歉，我知道这有点吹毛求疵了，但这确实是我脑子里会冒出来的念头，你知道吗？就像我读这篇文章的时候，我就……
[00:24:13.220] like oh is it better to be like the top medium friend than to be like the lowest ranked best? I see so you're next in line for the best friend circle. Yeah you're like up for promotion instead
[00:24:13.220] 比如，做个中等水平的顶级朋友是不是比做个排名最低的顶级朋友更好？我明白了，所以你就是下一个晋升顶级朋友的人选。是啊，你很有可能升职。
[00:24:27.140] of up for demotion. Oh my god the moment someone disappears you're like oh my god this this has been the moment I've been waiting for. Wait you're like the one making people disappear? Oh my god.
[00:24:27.140] 面临降职。我的天啊，当有人消失的那一刻，你会想：我的天啊，这就是我一直等待的时刻。等等，你是那个让人消失的人？我的天啊。
[00:24:42.980] But in all seriousness like I do feel there are a lot of pros to being a medium friend actually because I love my medium friends like I think it's so nice to just like catch up once in a while and
[00:24:42.980] 但说真的，我觉得做个通灵朋友有很多好处，因为我爱我的通灵朋友，我觉得偶尔聚聚聊聊天真的很好。
[00:24:56.500] like you have the most fun and then it's like a no strings attached ending kind of like you know you'll see them soon but it's not some like pressing I don't want to say obligation but
[00:24:56.500] 就像你玩得最开心，然后就以一种没有附加条件的方式结束，你知道你很快就会再见到他们，但又不会像是一种强迫，我不想用“义务”这个词，但是……
[00:25:07.060] sometimes you know you do feel like that sense of responsibility to hang out more with best friends so I feel like medium friends can offer a lot of that casual fun less stressful kind of vibe.
[00:25:07.060] 有时候你会觉得有责任多和最好的朋友出去玩，所以我觉得和关系一般的朋友可以带来很多轻松愉快、压力较小的氛围。
[00:25:20.340] I don't know stress is not the right word but you know what I mean it's just like less obligations. For sure especially if it's like you know you're always gonna have a good time with them and then
[00:25:20.340] 我不知道，压力这个词可能不太准确，但你知道我的意思，就是责任减轻了。尤其是如果你知道和他们在一起总是会很开心的话。
[00:25:27.860] there's less you're right like obligation of always having to keep up with them because I think it is also true that you probably only have enough time and space to truly support and help your
[00:25:27.860] 你说的没错，你确实没有太多义务去一直跟上他们的步伐，因为我觉得你可能也只有足够的时间和精力来真正支持和帮助你的家人。
[00:25:42.100] closest friends. If you're out here providing as much mental support or like hype man activities to like every single one of your friends it would probably be really exhausting and you might not
[00:25:42.100] 最亲密的朋友。如果你要给每个朋友都提供那么多的精神支持，或者像个啦啦队长一样到处助兴，那可能会非常累，而且你可能……
[00:25:54.820] even end up with enough time for yourself at the end. So it's like knowing that you have medium friends who have their own strong support group of best friends it's like okay nice I get
[00:25:54.820] 最后甚至还能留出足够的时间给自己。这就好比知道你有一些关系一般的朋友，而他们自己又有一群强大的死党支持，你会觉得：好吧，不错，我明白了。
[00:26:06.260] to have them just for the like good times and then you know maybe some like tough times sprinkled in there where you can provide your help when you both have time and space for it but then also you
[00:26:06.260] 拥有它们只是为了享受美好时光，然后你知道，也许其中也会穿插一些艰难时刻，当你们双方都有时间和空间时，你们可以互相帮助，但同时你
[00:26:16.100] like get to reap the benefits a little more maybe. That's true also like if your medium friend is someone who you have a shared hobby with and maybe the primary driver of your friendship
[00:26:16.100] 比如，或许能更多地享受到一些好处。如果你的中级朋友和你有共同的爱好，而且可能是你们友谊的主要维系者，那就更是如此了。
[00:26:28.180] then sometimes you can like turn your brain off and go to these hangouts right like oh let's just meet up and like do this activity together or whatever and it doesn't have to be like okay
[00:26:28.180] 有时候你可以放松一下，放空大脑，去参加一些聚会，比如“咱们聚聚，一起做点什么吧”，或者其他什么都行，不必非得是那种“好吧”的状态。
[00:26:36.500] let me sit down and update you on everything that's been happening in my life for the next two hours. That's so true it doesn't have to be as weighted maybe so then I think it could still be a lot of
[00:26:36.500] 接下来两个小时，让我坐下来跟你说说我生活中发生的一切。确实如此，也许不必那么在意，所以我觉得可能还是会有很多事发生。
[00:26:45.940] fun. I think it's also like kind of an honor almost if you're a medium friend and then the person shares with you like maybe hardships or like certain updates that are going on in their life
[00:26:45.940] 很有趣。我觉得如果你是一位心灵感应的朋友，对方会跟你分享他们生活中的困难或一些近况，这几乎也算是一种荣幸。
[00:26:57.780] and you're kind of like oh my god I'm so honored that they shared this with me like they must really think I'm trustworthy and I'm glad that I'm doing a good job even if I'm just a medium friend.
[00:26:57.780] 你会想，哦我的天哪，他们能和我分享这件事我感到非常荣幸，他们一定认为我很值得信赖，我很高兴自己做得很好，即使我只是一个普通朋友。
[00:27:08.260] Dude that's a good point too because I mean we've been talking this episode about I guess the gap between like a medium friend and a best friend or maybe just like the differences but
[00:27:08.260] 兄弟，你说的也很有道理，因为我们这期节目一直在讨论，嗯，就是普通朋友和挚友之间的差距，或者说，他们之间的差异。
[00:27:18.180] at the end of the day I feel like it is a really big honor to be someone's medium friend. It's still miles and leagues above acquaintance level like this is still someone you care about a lot and
[00:27:18.180] 说到底，我觉得能成为别人的“中级朋友”真的是一种莫大的荣幸。这远比普通朋友高出好几个档次，毕竟这是你非常关心的人。
[00:27:28.020] you prioritize whenever you have like maybe some extra bandwidth in your life and it's not something that is just like easily done or like easily achieved so I feel like you know just as for
[00:27:28.020] 当你生活中有了些额外的空闲时间时，你会优先处理这件事，但这并不是一件容易做到或轻易实现的事情，所以我觉得你知道，就像……
[00:27:40.900] medium friends yeah this is still very special friendships. It really is and you're right the higher you are on the medium friend spectrum you know the closer you get to that best friend circle
[00:27:40.900] 中等程度的朋友，是的，这仍然是非常特别的友谊。确实如此，你说得对，你在中等程度的朋友光谱上的位置越高，你就越接近最好的朋友圈。
[00:27:54.580] the more connection you get with this person and realistically medium friends are the ones who could at any moment become a best friend. Yeah yeah and I think things could happen like maybe
[00:27:54.580] 你和这个人建立的联系越多，现实点来说，中等程度的朋友就越有可能在某个时刻变成最好的朋友。是啊，我觉得可能会发生一些事，比如……
[00:28:07.780] someone who used to be your medium friend has a kid and then like it's on the same timeline as you and suddenly now you're best friends because of this shared experience. Yeah definitely I feel
[00:28:07.780] 以前跟你关系比较好的朋友，突然有了孩子，然后好像跟你的情况正好吻合，你们就因为这段共同的经历成了最好的朋友。嗯，我完全有这种感觉。
[00:28:18.100] like it's almost not a hard border between best friends and medium friends but maybe just like a ombre barrier or something. Actually another thing I was thinking about though in regards to medium
[00:28:18.100] 感觉好朋友和普通朋友之间几乎没有明确的界限，可能更像是一种渐变色的屏障之类的。其实，关于“普通朋友”这个概念，我还在想另一件事。
[00:28:31.060] friends is that group friends are sometimes medium friends. True. Maybe this group in its entity is like your best friend but like the individuals might be more like medium friends but then they're like at any moment these medium friends could be best friends. Yeah I think that's
[00:28:31.060] 朋友之间，群体中的朋友有时更像是“中等朋友”。确实如此。也许这个群体整体上就像你最好的朋友，但其中的个体可能更像是“中等朋友”，但这些“中等朋友”随时都有可能变成最好的朋友。嗯，我觉得是这样。
[00:28:53.460] definitely a fair point so that just kind of speaks to to like it's not always like a hard and fast rule right like there's all these blurred lines opportunities risks strengths weaknesses
[00:28:53.460] 这确实有道理，所以这也说明，事情并非总是泾渭分明的规则，机会、风险、优势和劣势之间往往存在着模糊的界限。
[00:29:06.340] just kidding but yeah I think it's kind of comforting in a sense to know that it's not so like oh you're a best friend and you're a medium friend like it's not the myspace top
[00:29:06.340] 开玩笑啦，不过我觉得某种程度上来说，知道这不是那种“你是我的挚友，你是我的普通朋友”之类的关系，会让人感到安慰，这跟MySpace上的那种“顶级好友”关系不一样。
[00:29:15.700] eight culture like we talked about. Yeah definitely. Oh I thought there was this one interesting part of the article though kind of similar to what we were talking about like showing support for a medium friend in the article the author kind of describes situations where like they're not
[00:29:15.700] 就像我们之前讨论的八种文化。是的，当然。哦，我觉得文章里有一部分很有意思，有点像我们刚才讨论的，比如在文章里，作者描述了一些他们不太愿意支持一位中年朋友的情况。
[00:29:31.860] really sure actually if they should show kindness or like reach out and provide support for certain medium friends so what are your thoughts on that? So I think this is an interesting one because I've
[00:29:31.860] 我真的不太确定他们是否应该对某些灵媒朋友表示善意或提供支持，所以你对此有什么看法？我觉得这个问题很有意思，因为我……
[00:29:45.540] definitely been there before where say a friend is going through a hard time and they're definitely closest there but I'm unsure if me reaching out would be like supportive for them or it might feel
[00:29:45.540] 我以前肯定有过这样的经历，比如朋友遇到困难，而他们又是我最亲近的人，但我不知道我主动联系他们是会给予他们支持，还是会让他们觉得……
[00:29:58.820] like overbearing or too much and that's like always the worry right especially when someone does go through tough times it's like how do I know if this message will tip them over the edge or like
[00:29:58.820] 就像是咄咄逼人或者太多了，这总是让人担心，对吧？尤其是在有人经历艰难时期的时候，我怎么知道这条信息会不会压垮他们？
[00:30:08.580] be a huge boost of help for them and I think at the end of the day it's gonna be case by case but it does kind of allude to the weirdness or like that weird gray area that medium friendship
[00:30:08.580] 这对他们来说无疑是莫大的帮助，我觉得最终还是要具体问题具体分析，但这确实暗示了那种微妙的灰色地带，那种中等程度的友谊。
[00:30:20.260] can place you at because if it's a close friend I would not hesitate to be like oh you know just wanted to check in and see how you're doing about x y and z but with medium friends you never know
[00:30:20.260] 我无法判断对方是好朋友还是普通朋友，因为如果是关系很亲密的朋友，我会毫不犹豫地说：“哦，想问候一下，看看你最近怎么样，关于x、y、z这些事。”但如果是关系一般的朋友，你就很难说了。
[00:30:29.940] right? Yeah yeah because sometimes you like don't even know they're going through something until someone else tells you. Yeah. And then it's like oh am I in the right place to be like hey I heard
[00:30:29.940] 对吧？是啊，因为有时候你根本不知道他们正在经历什么，直到别人告诉你。是啊。然后你就会想，哦，我来对地方了吗？嘿，我听说……
[00:30:42.980] this happen to you like blah blah but then they might be like how'd you hear this like I was trying to keep it private and then that's like a whole thing so I feel like it's definitely you're
[00:30:42.980] 这件事发生在你身上，比如blablabla，但他们可能会问，你怎么知道的？我明明想保密的，然后这就变成一件很麻烦的事了，所以我感觉这肯定是你
[00:30:53.060] right like it's definitely very difficult to navigate but I do think if they were the ones to share with you that they're going through a tough time definitely in the moment that they
[00:30:53.060] 没错，这确实很难理解，但我认为，如果他们愿意告诉你他们正在经历一段艰难时期，那肯定是在他们最需要的时候。
[00:31:01.940] shared it with you try to be there for them but then beyond that I guess it's kind of like feel it out and see what feels right. Yeah. And you also don't want to like put yourself in a difficult
[00:31:01.940] 跟你分享过，尽量在他们身边支持他们，但除此之外，我觉得还是得靠感觉，看看什么才是对的。是啊。而且你也不想让自己陷入困境。
[00:31:16.180] situation where maybe you actually don't even feel like you have the time or space so like okay maybe not today maybe like when I have more of that energy and availability. Yeah I think that's a
[00:31:16.180] 有时候你可能真的感觉自己没有时间或空间，所以就想，好吧，也许今天不行，也许等我更有精力和时间的时候再说。嗯，我觉得这很正常。
[00:31:30.420] good point and at the end of the day even if I look back on my personal experiences when maybe I was going through something hard explicit support and sympathy was always helpful but I
[00:31:30.420] 说得有道理，说到底，即使我回顾自己的个人经历，当我经历一些艰难时刻时，明确的支持和同情总是很有帮助的，但是……
[00:31:43.380] feel like there were tons of different ways that friends were able to be supportive without it maybe being like a really personal like sympathetic text you know like I feel like friends were fully
[00:31:43.380] 感觉朋友们有很多种不同的方式可以表达支持，不一定非得是那种很私人的、充满同情的短信，你知道，我觉得朋友们完全可以做到。
[00:31:53.140] supportive even if they didn't know I was going through something and they were just being their like crazy goofy unserious selves you know like sometimes just having fun with someone when you're
[00:31:53.140] 即使他们不知道我正在经历什么，他们仍然很支持我，他们只是像往常一样，傻乎乎的、不严肃地做着自己，你知道，就像有时候和别人一起玩闹一样。
[00:32:02.980] going through a tough time in itself can be a huge help so at the end of the day maybe that's almost the privilege or like opportunity as a medium friend like you can support your friend
[00:32:02.980] 经历艰难时期本身就能带来巨大的帮助，所以归根结底，或许作为像你这样的朋友，能够支持你的朋友，这几乎就是一种荣幸或机会。
[00:32:14.340] without doing like the two-hour deep talk with them. Like without even realizing sometimes. Yeah just by being yourself. Yeah that's a good point and you know sometimes we don't know the role of
[00:32:14.340] 不用像跟他们进行两个小时的深入谈话那样。有时候甚至都没意识到。是的，只要做你自己就好。是的，你说得对，你知道，有时候我们并不了解……
[00:32:27.460] friendship that we play for other people as we said we don't we're not really DTRing our friendships all day and every day so maybe trusting in yourself and in your strengths and weaknesses in your friendship that you can be utilized in a way maybe without even
[00:32:27.460] 我们为了别人而维系的友谊，正如我们所说，我们并非每天都在刻意维系友谊，所以或许应该相信自己，相信自己在友谊中的优势和劣势，这样或许就能以某种方式发挥作用，甚至无需任何额外努力。
[00:32:47.140] your knowing but like in a positive way for your friend whether that be in a supportive way or just like a really you know having a good time having a fun time way or even just like mutual shared
[00:32:47.140] 你知道，但这是对你的朋友来说的积极的方式，无论是支持，还是仅仅想和朋友一起度过一段美好的时光，或者只是彼此分享快乐。
[00:33:00.500] interests way. Yeah and it's been really interesting discussing this article with you because I think when I first read it I was like damn this article is kind of savage but the more we talk about it
[00:33:00.500] 很有意思。是啊，跟你讨论这篇文章真的很有意思，因为我第一次读的时候觉得，哇，这篇文章也太狠了吧，但我们讨论得越多，就越觉得它很有意思。
[00:33:11.140] and the more we kind of analyze it I feel like my takeaway is that I just have to learn to be okay with medium friendship because like we discussed earlier it's not always the dramatics or the
[00:33:11.140] 我们越分析越觉得，我的结论是我必须学会接受中等程度的友谊，因为就像我们之前讨论过的，友谊并不总是充满戏剧性或……
[00:33:23.140] emotions like sometimes it's just the best fit for two people in their lives. Justice for medium friendships and shout out to all the varying levels of friendship out there we really could
[00:33:23.140] 有时候，这种感觉就像是两个人生命中最合适的契合点。为中等程度的友谊正名，也向所有不同层次的友谊致敬，我们真的可以……
[00:33:33.300] not live life without our friends. True. So for any of our listeners if you've read this article or if you feel inspired to read the article then definitely feel free to let us know your thoughts
