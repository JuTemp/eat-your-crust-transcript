[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Amber. So today we have on our good friend Amber. And before we dive into the topic with Amber today, Crystal, do you have a Gen Z word for us this week?
[00:00:00.050] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal，我是Amber。今天我们请到了好朋友Amber。在和Amber深入探讨今天的话题之前，Crystal，你这周能不能给我们推荐一个Z世代的词汇？
[00:00:27.460] I do. So the word is actually a word this time, because I feel like in the past it's usually been phrases. The word is era. Oh. The usage of this, which I'm sure you two are relatively familiar with it, it's basically like in my blank era or like in your blank era. So it pretty much means during this time you are doing something.
[00:00:27.460] 是的。所以这次用的词确实是个单词，因为我觉得以前通常都是短语。这个词是“era”。哦。它的用法，我相信你们俩应该比较熟悉，基本上就是“在我的[空白]时期”或者“在你的[空白]时期”。所以它的意思大概是：在这段时间里，你正在做某事。
[00:00:55.260] So I guess like a good example would be like, I'm in my gymming era, which would mean that like, you're trying to go to the gym more. And it's like an active goal, I guess you could kind of put it as. Indeed, indeed. Maybe we can go around and say what era we're currently in to like, rather demonstrate the usage. And I can start. I've been in my wake up at 7am era because our room doesn't have any blackout curtains.
[00:00:55.260] 所以我觉得举个例子就好，比如，我现在处于“健身时代”，意思是说，你正在努力多去健身房。这就像一个积极的目标，你可以这么说。确实如此。也许我们可以轮流说说自己目前处于哪个时代，这样就能更好地说明它的用法。我先来。我现在处于“早上7点起床时代”，因为我们房间没有遮光窗帘。
[00:01:22.260] So it's like, it has these kind of like thin blinds that are made from like fabric. So in the morning, all the sunlight shines through our window into the bedroom, because the sun has been rising so early. I have also been rising early with the sun. So yeah, I'm in my wake up at 7am era. I'm curious, does James also wake up with you?
[00:01:22.260] 所以，它装的是那种薄薄的布帘。早上，阳光会透过窗户照进卧室，因为太阳升得特别早。我也跟着太阳一起早起。所以，我现在每天早上7点就起床了。我很好奇，詹姆斯也和你一起起床吗？
[00:01:46.860] Yeah, he does. And then we kind of take turns like falling back asleep. Sometimes I'll wake up and I'll come to at 7am. And I vaguely hear like TikTok sounds coming from his side of the bed. And then I'll like pass out again. We just go through that until like 8.30, 9am. Oh my god. I'm low key in that right now too. But it's not as like peaceful as yours. It's because like we have construction outside. So every morning when I wake up, I'm like, oh, please.
[00:01:46.860] 是啊，他会。然后我们就轮流睡着。有时候我会醒来，早上七点就清醒了。然后我隐约听到他那边传来TikTok的声音。然后我就又睡着了。我们就这么一直睡到八点半、九点。我的天哪。我现在也差不多是这样。不过不像你家那么安静。因为外面在施工。所以每天早上我醒来的时候，都会想，哎，真是的。
[00:02:16.980] Oh, I'm in my water bottle era. Oh, because in the past, I usually never bring a water bottle around. But this year for my birthday, I asked for a water bottle. And ever since getting it, I've been trying, like consciously putting in the effort to bring it everywhere. Like I bring it to work. I bring it when I go out. I'm in my water bottle era.
[00:02:16.980] 哦，我现在可是水瓶时代了。哦，因为以前我几乎从来不带水瓶。但今年生日，我跟人要了个水瓶。自从收到水瓶之后，我就一直在努力，有意识地把它带到任何地方。比如上班带，出门也带。我现在可是水瓶时代了。
[00:02:41.800] Love that. How big is it? Oh my god, it's so small. I specifically asked. I specifically asked for the smallest size, which is 17 ounces. Wait, low key same because I actually feel like it's easier to like bring around and carry with you to actually make sure you're like drinking water. But then when I run out, I run out. Yeah.
[00:02:41.800] 真喜欢。它有多大？我的天，好小啊。我特意问过了。我特意要了最小的，17盎司。等等，其实我也一样，因为我觉得这样更容易随身携带，可以确保自己随时喝水。但是喝完了就没了。是啊。
[00:03:02.560] Oh, I actually mentioned this the other day, but I think I'm in my rat girl era. I just like, I saw a TikTok that was like this summer instead of hot girl summer, people should just have like two days to themselves and just rot. And that's my life. Dude, I've been unknowingly in my rat girl era for life. It's so peaceful still. It truly is. I love embracing my rat girl side too.
[00:03:02.560] 哦，其实前几天我就提过这事儿了，我觉得我现在正处于“鼠女”时期。我之前在TikTok上看到一个视频，说今年夏天与其搞什么“辣妹夏天”，不如大家给自己放两天假，好好放松一下。这就是我现在的状态。老兄，我好像一直都处于“鼠女”时期，只是自己没意识到而已。现在感觉好平静啊，真的。我也很喜欢这种“鼠女”的状态。
[00:03:32.820] Sometimes when there's a weekend with like no plans, I'm like, oh my god, this is my vegetation era. Oh my god, yes. Oh wait, I literally remember that weekend when James was gone. And then we were gonna hang out or something. But then you were just like, man, I just want to vegetate. I was like, sorry guys, don't count. I'm gonna show up to anything this weekend. So this word era, I have a feeling because I couldn't really find an origin for it.
[00:03:32.820] 有时候周末没什么安排，我就会想，天哪，这简直就是我的“植物时代”。天哪，没错。等等，我好像还记得詹姆斯不在家的那个周末。我们本来打算一起出去玩什么的。结果你突然说，唉，我只想好好休息。我就说，不好意思，算了。这个周末我什么都参加。所以，我感觉“时代”这个词，我好像找不到它的出处。
[00:04:02.060] But I feel like it might be influenced by Taylor Swift because you know how she has like different eras for her albums kind of unofficially, I guess. And even her tour right now, it's called the Eras Tour. Oh, interesting. Because I think she like specifically is singing songs from all the albums. So I feel like that might have had some influence on the usage of the eras word. It actually reminds me of something core, you know? Oh.
[00:04:02.060] 但我感觉这可能受到了泰勒·斯威夫特的影响，因为你知道，她好像会给自己的专辑划分不同的时期，虽然不是官方的，但我觉得是这样。甚至她现在的巡演也叫“时代巡演”（Eras Tour）。哦，有意思。因为我觉得她会专门演唱所有专辑里的歌曲。所以我感觉这可能对“时代”这个词的使用产生了一些影响。这让我想起了核心（core）这个词，你知道吗？哦。
[00:04:30.140] Like how people are like cottagecore or like balletcore or I can't think of anymore. But just those two. Yeah. I was almost thinking, I mean, I guess like I was just thinking about the literal meaning of this word era. In history class, you like learn about all the different eras and stuff. And I was like, oh, maybe some high school students were learning about it in history. And they were like, oh, fuck it. Like, let's just use it in our daily terminology. Maybe. Maybe. I like it. I like it.
[00:04:30.140] 就像有些人喜欢田园风或者芭蕾风，或者我想不出别的了。反正就这两个。嗯。我当时就在想，我是说，我当时在想“时代”这个词的字面意思。历史课上，你会学到各种不同的时代之类的。然后我就想，哦，也许有些高中生在历史课上学过这个词。然后他们就想，算了，管它呢。干脆把它用在日常用语里吧。也许吧。也许吧。我喜欢这个词。我喜欢它。
[00:04:58.760] It's kind of like a deviation of the word phase. You know, like people used to say, oh, I'm like in this whatever phase. But I feel like phase started to get a really negative connotation in some words. So people would be like, oh, it's not a phase, mom. It's a lifestyle. And then phase started like falling out of style. So I think era is a pretty good replacement for that. I like it. It sounds sophisticated. It does. Even rat girl era. Yeah.
[00:04:58.760] 这有点像是“阶段”这个词的变体。你知道，以前人们会说，哦，我现在正处于某个阶段。但我觉得“阶段”这个词在某些语境下开始带上了很负面的含义。所以人们会说，哦，这不是阶段，妈妈。这是一种生活方式。然后“阶段”这个词就开始过时了。所以我认为“时代”是个不错的替代词。我喜欢它。听起来很高级。确实如此。甚至“鼠女时代”也行。是的。
[00:05:27.200] All right. So let's jump into our actual topic this week, which is talking about our relationships with anime and going into weed culture. I guess we can start off by talking about what age we started watching anime and what was the anime that hooked you in? I can start. I've never been hooked into anime.
[00:05:27.200] 好的。那我们就直接进入本周的主题吧，聊聊我们和动漫的关系，以及大麻文化。我想我们可以先从大家开始看动漫的年龄说起，以及哪部动漫让你入坑？我先来。我从来没迷上过动漫。
[00:05:53.660] But do you guys remember like when we were younger in the evenings, Cartoon Network would show like, I think Naruto and one of the ones that I saw was like Inuyasha. And I think Bleach as well. I think those were like three of the bigger ones that were shown on Cartoon Network. English dubbed, of course. I started watching in like fifth grade. So that's like 15 years ago now. That's crazy, dude.
[00:05:53.660] 你们还记得吗？我们小时候，晚上卡通频道会播《火影忍者》，我还看过《犬夜叉》和《死神》。我觉得这三部算是卡通频道当时比较热门的动画了。当然都是英文配音版的。我大概从五年级开始看，到现在已经15年了。真是不可思议啊！
[00:06:23.440] Yeah. I know like they used to play it on the TV, but I don't think I ever like stayed up late enough or like was allowed to watch TV that late to like watch anime on TV. But my friend in fifth grade introduced me to Bleach, which I think is a little crazy for being in fifth grade. But she would give me like, I don't even know what I watched it on, but I definitely watched Bleach.
[00:06:23.440] 是啊。我知道以前电视上会放，但我好像从来没熬夜到那么晚，也没被允许看那么晚的电视看动画。不过我五年级的朋友给我介绍了《死神》，我觉得五年级就看《死神》有点疯狂。她会给我看，我甚至都记不清当时是在哪个频道看的，但我肯定看过《死神》。
[00:06:47.220] And then she also gave me like DVDs or like also CDs of Bleach movies and stuff like that. But yeah, that was my gateway. I think I'm probably a little bit more like Crystal where I didn't really start watching anime voluntarily until I was 22, 23. The first anime that I really, really watched was My Hero Academia. Oh my God. And I even remember the whole like setting and the premise.
[00:06:47.220] 然后她还给了我一些《死神》电影之类的DVD或CD。没错，那就是我的入门之作。我觉得我可能更像Crystal，直到22、23岁才开始主动看动画。我真正认真看的第一部动画是《我的英雄学院》。我的天哪。我甚至还记得整个故事的背景设定和剧情梗概。
[00:07:16.520] Like I think I lost some bet with James and James is a big anime watcher, anime enjoyer. And so he was like, okay, now you have to watch this. And I was like, okay. And it was really good. And I was kind of sucked into it, but not enough to watch like a bunch of other animes. I was more sucked into this specific anime itself. But I did have exposure to anime when I was younger because a lot of my friends did really enjoy anime.
[00:07:16.520] 我记得我好像跟詹姆斯打赌输了，詹姆斯是个动漫迷，特别喜欢看动漫。所以他就说，好吧，那你现在必须看这个。我就说，好吧。结果真的很好看。我有点入迷了，但也没到去看其他动漫的程度。我当时完全被这部动漫吸引住了。不过我小时候也接触过动漫，因为我很多朋友都很喜欢看动漫。
[00:07:41.600] In Inuyasha, like Crystal said, I was at a family friend party and my family friend who was like maybe four years older than me. She was like, oh, I have this DVD. Like we can watch it. And she like popped into the DVD and it's Inuyasha. And I was like, whoa. And then my other family friend, she was really into Cardcaptor Sakura. If you guys remember that. I have no idea what that is. Oh my God. I thought that was like super famous. It has like Masked Tuxedo Man. Wait, you guys don't know what I'm talking about? Sailor Moon?
[00:07:41.600] 就像Crystal说的那样，在《犬夜叉》那会儿，我去参加一个家庭朋友的聚会，我一个比我大四岁的朋友突然说：“哦，我有张DVD，我们可以一起看。”然后她就放了出来，是《犬夜叉》。我当时就惊呆了。然后我另一个朋友特别喜欢《魔卡少女樱》。你们应该还记得吧？我完全不知道那是什么。我的天哪！我还以为那部动画超级有名呢。里面还有个蒙面夜礼服男。等等，你们不知道我在说什么？《美少女战士》？
[00:08:11.460] Masked Tuxedo Man? Wait, that's what I was thinking. Oh, am I mixing up my anime? But yeah, she was really into that. So we would watch it sometimes. I guess it really wasn't until I was 23 years old that I started watching anime myself. I think my brother has always enjoyed anime. I vaguely remember like when Inuyasha was on TV. I would watch it and I like literally had no idea what was going on.
[00:08:11.460] 蒙面夜礼服男？等等，我刚才想的也是这个。哦，我是不是把动漫搞混了？不过，她确实很喜欢那部。所以我们偶尔会一起看。我猜直到23岁我才开始自己看动漫。我觉得我哥哥一直都很喜欢动漫。我隐约记得《犬夜叉》在电视上播的时候，我也会看，但我完全不知道剧情。
[00:08:38.920] Because also like you have to catch it at the same time every day, which is not really what we did. So it was just like, oh my God, like what is going on this episode? And I didn't really get sucked into shows. But I do watch anime movies sometimes. I feel like Spirited Away was like, it made big waves when we were younger. And just like Ghibli movies in general. But to be honest, I've only seen like maybe two or three Ghibli movies.
[00:08:38.920] 因为你必须每天在同一时间观看，而我们并没有这样做。所以当时的感觉就是，我的天哪，这集讲的是什么？我其实不太会沉迷于电视剧。但我偶尔会看动画电影。我觉得《千与千寻》在我们小时候很火。还有吉卜力工作室的电影，总的来说。但说实话，我可能只看过两三部吉卜力电影。
[00:09:10.000] Yeah, I feel like one of the things that kind of intimidates me about anime is the sheer number of episodes there are. And it's kind of interesting when you think about it because a lot of anime episodes from my experience tend to be shorter. In terms of duration, it's probably not that long. And I've watched Succession, which is like 40 hours of TV. I just have like that thing of, oh, can I really sit down and watch like 200 episodes of this one anime? You know, it's more like a mental barrier, I think.
[00:09:10.000] 是啊，我觉得动漫最让我望而却步的地方之一就是集数太多了。仔细想想还挺有意思的，因为就我的经验来看，很多动漫的单集其实都比较短。就时长而言，可能并不算长。我看过《继承之战》，那可是40个小时的剧啊。我总会想，我真的能坐下来一口气看完一部动漫的200集吗？我觉得这更像是一种心理障碍。
[00:09:39.900] I feel like, you know, they're like about 20 minutes long. But if you really think about it with like all the recap and like the credits and everything, it ends up being like 10, 15 minutes, really. They're so short. Skip intro. Yeah. It's true. So James, when he watches, he actually does this thing where he skips through. So like for him, he just watches the subbed versions, right?
[00:09:39.900] 我觉得，你知道，它们看起来大概有20分钟长。但如果你仔细想想，把所有剧情回顾、片尾字幕之类的都算进去，实际上也就10、15分钟。它们真的太短了。跳过片头。对，确实如此。所以詹姆斯看的时候，他会直接快进。对他来说，他只看字幕版，对吧？
[00:10:06.440] So like the audio is in the original Japanese and then he just reads the subtitles. So he just reads the subs, skips, reads, skips, reads, skips. So it's almost like he's reading manga. And I was like, just read the manga. He was like, I do. And I was like, wait, what the fuck? He's watching a slideshow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's so funny. Might as well just watch it on TikTok. True.
[00:10:06.440] 所以，音频是日语原声，然后他就只看字幕。他就读字幕，跳过，读，跳过，读，跳过。感觉就像他在看漫画一样。我就说，你就直接看漫画不就好了。他说，我看啊。我就想，等等，什么鬼？他这是在看幻灯片啊。是啊，是啊，太搞笑了。还不如直接在TikTok上看呢。确实。
[00:10:32.760] I did try to watch some anime this past year, actually. I was talking with some friends and they were saying like, or we were talking about shows that we like. And I was like, oh, low key. I really love stories where there's like time travel involved or like reliving lives or something like that. And they're like, dude, there's like a whole genre of anime for this. And I was like, really? So they told me I should try to watch anime. And I was like, um, okay, I guess.
[00:10:32.760] 其实去年我确实试着看过一些动漫。我和几个朋友聊天，他们聊到我们喜欢的动漫。我就说，哦，其实我挺喜欢那种有穿越时空、重生之类的故事。他们说，哇，动漫里有很多这种类型的。我就说，真的吗？所以他们就建议我看看动漫。我就说，嗯，好吧。
[00:11:02.420] So I got the suggestion to watch Erased, which is like a short anime too. I think it was only like 16 or 20 episodes. So they're like, oh, it won't be too bad. You won't have to like spend a hell of time watching it. It could be like an intro to anime. And I was like, okay, I'll give it a try. It was like pretty interesting. Not bad. Yeah. I would speak more on it, except I remember I liked it.
[00:11:02.420] 所以有人推荐我看《只有我不在的街道》，那也是一部短篇动画，好像只有16到20集。他们说，哦，应该还不错，不用花太多时间，可以当入门动画。我就想，好吧，试试看。结果还挺有意思的，挺好的。嗯，本来想多说说的，但我记得我挺喜欢的。
[00:11:29.580] But with a lot of anime and because I've watched so many, I only like vaguely remember if I like it or don't like it. And I don't remember what happened. So you're like, yes, that was a good one. But I don't remember any details. Wait, I low key feel that though, because I read books as a hobby. So then when people are like, oh, I'm reading this book. I'm like, oh shit, I read that. And they're like, oh my God, like, do you remember this part? And I'm like, no, but I do remember that was like a decent book.
[00:11:29.580] 但是很多动漫我都看过，而且看得太多，所以对喜不喜欢的印象很模糊，也记不清具体情节了。所以你会觉得，嗯，这部动漫还不错，但细节什么的就想不起来了。等等，其实我也有这种感觉，因为我平时喜欢读书。所以当别人说，哦，我在读这本书的时候，我就会想，我去，我也读过。然后他们会问，我的天，你还记得这部分吗？我就会说，不记得了，但我记得这本书还不错。
[00:11:59.980] Even with shows, like any show, if I'm just watching something else right now and they like bring up a name from a previous show or like something else that I've consumed, I'll just be like, I literally don't know who that is. It's like the main character. You're like, who? I guess, especially with anime having 200 plus episodes for some of the really long ones. It's probably like really easy to just, you have to like store other shit in your brain.
[00:11:59.980] 即使是电视剧，就像其他任何剧一样，如果我正在看别的，突然提到之前看过的某个剧或者其他作品里出现过的名字，我就会想，我根本不知道他是谁。比如主角，你会想，他是谁？我觉得，尤其是一些篇幅很长的动画，动辄两百多集，很容易就想不起来。你得把其他东西都记在脑子里才行。
[00:12:29.920] Do you keep my anime list, Amber? I don't. I think I did. Like there was this one summer probably in like high school where I just like binge watched hella anime and it was just like random anime too. I probably like saved a few of them. But then since then, I haven't. I like try to keep track of all the ones that I've watched, but I really cannot remember. My anime list for anyone who doesn't know is a way to track all the animes that you've watched. You can like write them.
[00:12:29.920] Amber，你还留着我的动漫列表吗？我没有。我想我以前留过。大概是高中那年夏天，我疯狂地刷了好多动漫，而且都是些乱七八糟的。我可能还保存了一些。但从那以后，我就没再保存过了。我试着记录我看过的所有动漫，但我真的记不清了。动漫列表，可能有人不知道，就是用来记录你看过的所有动漫的。你可以把它们写下来。
[00:12:58.480] It's pretty much like the anime equivalent of Goodreads. When I first started dating James, I was like asking him about it and I knew about the concept of my anime list because a lot of my close friends kept it. We opened his account to like see what animes he like ranked really high and stuff and I found a written review on it. And there wasn't that many, maybe like a couple, but I was reading it and I was like dying laughing. Like it was so funny for some reason to think about James like sitting down at a computer, like typing out this review for this anime.
[00:12:58.480] 它基本上就是动漫版的 Goodreads。我刚开始和 James 约会的时候，就问过他关于 Goodreads 的事，因为我很多好朋友都有自己的动漫列表，所以我也知道这个概念。我们打开了他的账号，想看看他喜欢的动漫排名有多高之类的，结果我发现了一篇他写的动漫评论。评论不多，可能就一两篇吧，但我读着读着就笑死了。不知道为什么，想象 James 坐在电脑前，敲着键盘写这篇动漫评论的样子，就觉得特别搞笑。
[00:13:30.140] That's so funny. Wait, that is really funny. I definitely can't imagine that either. I know, right? He's just so serious. He's like, damn, this anime was so shit. Funny enough, it was actually like a glowing review, which I feel like made it way funnier. He actually analyzed the anime. It's so good that he actually was put into action. Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:30.140] 太搞笑了。等等，这真的太搞笑了。我也完全想象不出来。是啊，对吧？他当时一脸严肃。他好像在说，这动画烂透了。结果，这居然是篇好评，我觉得这反而更搞笑了。他居然还分析了这部动画。他居然真的动手了，真是太厉害了。对，没错。
[00:13:57.760] Okay, so I have a question as someone who doesn't really watch anime. So when I received the recommendation to watch Erased, there was like a whole discussion happening because it was like a couple friends and they were like, oh, is that like beginner friendly? You know, like, and they were like kind of talking about they're like, hmm, is this acceptable as like the first anime to watch?
[00:13:57.760] 好吧，我不太看动画，所以有个问题。当初有人推荐我看《只有我不在的街道》的时候，我和几个朋友就展开了一番讨论，他们问，这部动画适合新手吗？他们还在讨论，这部动画适合作为第一部看的动画吗？
[00:14:20.660] And then after I watched Erased, they were like, okay, maybe you should watch Death Note because Death Note is like an iconic beginner anime. And I was like, dude, what is beginner anime? Like, why am I starting from level zero? Like, what does this mean? Am I not good enough for intermediate anime yet? I feel like I would also definitely recommend Death Note as a beginner anime.
[00:14:20.660] 看完《只有我不在的街道》之后，他们就说，好吧，也许你应该看看《死亡笔记》，因为《死亡笔记》是入门级动画的经典之作。我当时就懵了，老兄，什么是入门级动画？我为什么要从零开始？这是什么意思？难道我还没资格看中级动画吗？我觉得我也会毫不犹豫地推荐《死亡笔记》作为入门级动画。
[00:14:46.940] But I feel like length is a big part of it because like, you know, people who haven't watched anime before do not want to like commit that time. Right. So it's definitely easier to get people into it if they know it's just like a 20 episode series. I'm trying to think what an intermediate or advanced anime would be. I think it's just like, you know, like the animes.
[00:14:46.940] 但我感觉时长是个很重要的因素，因为你知道，以前没看过动画的人不想投入那么多时间。没错。所以如果人们知道一部动画只有20集左右，那肯定更容易让他们入坑。我在想，中级或高级动画应该是什么水平。我觉得就像……你知道的，像那种……动画。
[00:15:12.260] Sometimes there's like more convoluted or like satirical plots that those ones I feel like, I don't know, maybe it would be an interesting gateway for people to get like interested. But at the same time, it's like, they probably don't want to be plopped into an anime that's like, super mind blowing. And they're like, wait, I just started watching this. What's going on?
[00:15:12.260] 有时候剧情会更复杂，或者更讽刺一些，我觉得，我不知道，也许这会是一个吸引人们兴趣的有趣切入点。但同时，他们可能也不想一下子就看一部超级烧脑的动画。然后他们会想，等等，我才刚开始看，这到底是怎么回事？
[00:15:36.780] For satirical plots and stuff, would it be like, if you didn't watch enough anime, like you might not even realize it's satire? Maybe. And you might also feel like, I don't even know like how to explain it because I do not remember any animes that I've watched. But I definitely feel like, not even just like satirical, but if it's like just something like crazy happening, you'll be like, oh, why the fuck do people watch this?
[00:15:36.780] 对于讽刺剧情之类的，是不是如果你看的动画不够多，可能根本意识不到它是讽刺作品？也许吧。你可能还会觉得，我甚至不知道该怎么解释，因为我记不清自己看过哪些动画了。但我感觉，不仅仅是讽刺，如果剧情本身就很疯狂，你肯定会想，这他妈到底是什么鬼东西？
[00:16:06.780] You know? Oh. Yeah. Interesting. I think that does bring up a good point, though, of like anime and a lot of characteristics about anime, I think can be really different from how American TV is or even like Korean TV is, at least for me. Of course, the biggest difference to me was like reading the subs part where I was like, holy shit, I actually have to like concentrate on like reading the subs now. So then we would only really watch it during like mealtimes because I have to like stare at the subs.
[00:16:06.780] 你知道吗？哦，是啊，有意思。不过，我觉得你确实提到了一个很好的观点，比如动漫以及动漫的很多特点，我觉得它们和美剧甚至韩剧都截然不同，至少对我来说是这样。当然，对我来说最大的区别在于看字幕，我当时就想，我的天，我现在居然要集中注意力看字幕了。所以我们通常只在吃饭的时候看，因为我得盯着字幕。
[00:16:36.180] And if we put it up on the TV and we weren't eating something, then I feel like I would just be on my phone or something. Just a personal bad habit. Another thing that struck me as interesting was apparently there's this whole like budget thing about like animations. And I really only heard about this when I was watching Haikyuu. There was a season in Haikyuu where the first like 10 episodes of the season, the animation looked like a slideshow to use Crystal's terms, where it was like the same picture.
[00:16:36.180] 如果我们在电视上看动画，而我们又没在吃东西，那我感觉自己肯定会玩手机什么的。这只是我个人的一个坏习惯。还有一点让我觉得很有意思，那就是动画制作似乎也有预算限制。我是在看《排球少年》的时候才了解到这个概念的。有一季《排球少年》的前十集，动画的画面就像幻灯片一样，用Crystal的话来说，就是同一幅画面。
[00:17:04.480] But then it would just move up and down and up and down. And then like just the subs would change or like just the mouths would open and close and open and close. But it like wasn't to the beat of like or like the inflection of the actual phrase. And I was like, what the fuck is this? And then James was like, oh, you know, like there's all this drama about anime studios. And then they usually save the budget for like more budget constrained shows, I guess, where like just the key episodes have really good animation.
[00:17:04.480] 但后来它就一直上下晃动，上下晃动。然后就像字幕会变化，或者嘴巴会张开又合上，张开又合上。但它跟实际台词的节奏和语调完全不搭。我就想，这他妈是什么玩意儿？然后詹姆斯说，哦，你知道，动画工作室之间有很多恩怨。他们通常会把预算留给那些预算比较紧张的动画，我猜，只有关键集数的动画才会做得特别好。
[00:17:29.280] And then like the more quote unquote filler episodes have shittier animation so that the good episodes could be like the most flashy episodes of the show. And I was like, this is just insane to me. Like I cannot even understand or like grasp this. And it's just like all this tea about the studios that he just knows. And then the other thing, too, was like my friend Nat, she's like super into anime as well. She was like, oh, I'm going to watch this new anime. And I was like, oh, why?
[00:17:29.280] 然后，那些所谓的“填充集”的动画质量就比较差，这样才能让那些精彩的集数成为整部剧中最炫酷的。我当时就觉得，这简直太疯狂了。我完全无法理解。感觉他好像知道所有关于动画制作公司的内幕消息。还有一件事，我的朋友娜特，她也是个超级动漫迷。她说，哦，我要去看一部新动画。我就问，哦，为什么？
[00:17:58.080] I like do like the plot or something. She's like, oh, no, there's just like this voice actor that I really like. And I was like, whoa, like the concept of following a voice actor to me was just culturally so crazy. That's so wild. Yeah, no, literally, I saw TikTok yesterday and then it was like a voice actor voicing his character. But it's like you could they were filming the actual VA. And then the comments under that TikTok were just like, I just need the voice actor. I don't even need to watch the anime.
[00:17:58.080] 我挺喜欢剧情之类的。她就说，哦，不，我特别喜欢一个声优。我当时就想，哇，追星这种事对我来说简直太疯狂了。太不可思议了。是啊，真的，我昨天在TikTok上看到一个视频，一个声优在给他的角色配音。但感觉就像是在拍摄原声优本人。然后那个TikTok下面的评论都是，我只需要那个声优。我甚至不需要看动画。
[00:18:27.460] I was like, oh, my God. So crazy. And kind of on the flip side of the budget thing, I also saw another TikTok that was like, so one of One Piece's most recent episodes, they had, what is it, like 200 frames in the span of like a few seconds. Wow. Yeah, I was like, well, I don't really know how it works. And I'm definitely not quoting it correctly.
[00:18:27.460] 我当时就想，我的天哪，太疯狂了。说到预算问题，我还看到另一个TikTok视频，说《海贼王》最近的一集里，几秒钟之内居然出现了200帧。哇。我当时就想，我真不知道这是怎么做到的。而且我肯定没把原文复述清楚。
[00:18:55.220] Because I don't remember exactly like what the numbers were. But it was like they had so much art in just a split second, basically. Mm hmm. Wow. I guess One Piece has the budget because aren't they like the longest running anime ever or something? I definitely I watched up to like episode 700 or something. Oh, my God. No, but there's people that keep up. It's insane. But yeah, I need ketchup.
[00:18:55.220] 因为我记不清具体数字了。但感觉他们好像在一瞬间就创作出了那么多作品。嗯哼。哇。我猜《海贼王》预算很充足，因为它是史上播出时间最长的动画之一吧？我肯定看过700集左右。我的天哪。不，但确实有人能坚持看完。太疯狂了。对了，我需要番茄酱。
[00:19:25.000] Dude, I remember within the past three years, there was a One Piece movie. And I remember seeing people going to the movies and like dressing up as the main character guy, the hat and everything. Yeah. I was like, well, that's pretty cool. I've noticed that like they've been showing more anime movies in America, or at least like in the places that we live. They even will do the like original Japanese dub and then with the English subtitles, which is very cool to see.
[00:19:25.000] 哥们儿，我记得三年前上映过一部《海贼王》电影。我记得当时看到有人去看电影，还打扮成主角的样子，帽子什么的都模仿得惟妙惟肖。是啊，我就觉得，哇，真酷。我注意到，现在美国，或者至少在我们住的地方，放映的动画电影越来越多了。他们甚至会放日语原声配音版，再配上英文字幕，这真是太棒了。
[00:19:54.000] Like truly showing how anime has grown and the audience, the international audience is like really active as well. I know like a recent hype one was like the Jujutsu Kaisen one. A few of us actually went to go watch that one. And I think somebody watched it like twice or something. I was like, damn, it was good, though. I like how you were like, oh, a recent big one was Jujutsu Kaisen and me and Jizu just had like blank faces.
[00:19:54.000] 就像真正展现了动漫的发展历程和观众群体，尤其是国际观众，他们真的非常活跃。我知道最近很火的一部是《咒术回战》。我们几个还特意去看了。我记得好像有人看了两遍。我当时就觉得，哇，真好看。我喜欢你当时说“哦，最近很火的是《咒术回战》”，而我和Jizu却一脸茫然的样子。
[00:20:25.000] Wait, I actually know that one. Oh, okay. Okay, not to expose James again, but James was gifted like a Jujutsu Kaisen shirt. So sometimes he wears it. Okay. Wait, that's so cute. I was literally like blank face. I was like, yes, totally. You're like, nice. I actually have some theories on, okay, I guess it's not theories, but maybe more like inflection points where I felt like anime got really mainstream.
[00:20:25.000] 等等，我居然知道这个。哦，好吧。好吧，我不想再揭穿詹姆斯了，不过詹姆斯收到了一件《咒术回战》的T恤作为礼物。所以他有时候会穿。好吧。等等，这也太可爱了吧。我当时真的一脸懵。我就想，对啊，完全同意。你真好。我其实有一些想法，好吧，我猜应该不算是想法，或许更像是动漫真正走向主流的转折点。
[00:20:53.020] One is like in middle school and high school, I know people watched anime, especially since the school I went to for high school was like very Asian. But even back then, I feel like it was kind of still more on the niche level. There was like that one girl or like my one friend at high school who was like known to really like One Piece. And like people liked Cowboy Bebop, but it was only like a handful of them who would talk about it, things like that.
[00:20:53.020] 我觉得在初中和高中的时候，有人看动漫，尤其是我上的高中，亚裔学生很多。但即使在那时候，我觉得动漫也还是比较小众的。我高中时就有一个女生，或者说我一个朋友，特别喜欢《海贼王》。也有人喜欢《星际牛仔》，但只有少数人会公开讨论，诸如此类。
[00:21:18.540] So junior, senior year though, when Attack on Titans came out, every single class period, people would like group up and talk about it. And that was the first time where I felt like I was really not in the crowd because I didn't know it and I didn't watch it. And that's when I was like, oh shit, like this is kind of becoming like mainstream to the point where people are comfortable talking about it in public sort of. Not to say there's any shame in it, but before it was a little bit more like hidden, right? Yeah. Wait, question.
[00:21:18.540] 所以到了高二、高三那年，《进击的巨人》播出的时候，几乎每节课大家都会聚在一起讨论。那是我第一次感觉自己格格不入，因为我之前不知道这部动画，也没看过。那时候我就想，卧槽，这玩意儿居然开始流行起来了，大家都能很自在地公开讨论。倒不是说这有什么丢人的，只是以前讨论这个话题比较隐晦，对吧？嗯。等等，我有个问题。
[00:21:47.700] So I actually thought Attack on Titan was newer because I feel like people have been talking about it recently. But I thought it was like, I don't know, like the up and coming. No, it's because they came out with like a new season recently. Oh, okay, okay. And I guess just like every time they come out with new seasons, like, you know, people are on it. So does that mean it's been a long time? Like how many seasons are there? Honestly, I have no clue.
[00:21:47.700] 所以，我之前一直以为《进击的巨人》是比较新的，因为感觉最近大家都在讨论它。我以为它就像是那种，嗯，算是新番吧。不，是因为他们最近出了新一季。哦，好吧好吧。我想就像每次出新一季一样，大家都会关注。那是不是意味着已经很久了？一共多少季了？说实话，我完全不知道。
[00:22:17.600] But I definitely, I watched it a little bit when it first came out. I want to say that was like the end of high school for me. I see. Wait, okay. I just looked it up. There's only four seasons. Oh, wow. That's crazy. And the fourth season is the final season. But it did come out 2022. Yeah, yeah. But I think it's still like super like hype for a lot of people. Yeah.
[00:22:17.600] 但我肯定在它刚播出的时候看过一点。我想说，那差不多是我高中毕业的时候。我明白了。等等，好吧。我刚查了一下。只有四季。哇。太不可思议了。而且第四季是最后一季。不过它是2022年播出的。是啊，是啊。但我认为它对很多人来说仍然非常火爆。是啊。
[00:22:45.160] And I think there's also like that connection to characters. So like, I don't know if you've seen like filters and stuff on like TikTok and stuff. I feel like people will keep it kind of in the loop because of like social media and their connection to these characters. Interesting. So I guess that means production took a while too if it first came out in like high school-ish. And then the final season was season four. Interesting.
[00:22:45.160] 我觉得大家和角色之间也有那种联系。比如说，不知道你有没有在TikTok之类的平台上看到过滤镜之类的东西。我觉得大家会因为社交媒体和他们与这些角色的联系而持续关注这部剧。挺有意思的。所以如果这部剧最初是在高中时期播出的，那制作过程应该也花了不少时间。然后最后一季是第四季。挺有意思的。
[00:23:12.120] I don't know how many episodes they have per season though. Because I feel like usually animes, they turn out a lot of episodes pretty quickly. So I was surprised that they did it like season by season. Interesting. So the second inflection point that I have, I feel like is going to be kind of controversial. But hear me out, okay? Okay.
[00:23:12.120] 我不知道他们每季有多少集。因为我觉得通常动画都是很快就出很多集。所以他们按季播出让我有点意外。挺有意思的。接下来我要说的第二个转折点，我觉得可能会引起一些争议。不过请听我解释，好吗？好。
[00:23:33.140] I subscribe to the thought that when things have like a very mania level fandom, you know, those people might love something intensely, but it doesn't leak out to the mainstream. And sometimes like if people are super obsessed with it, then I feel like it can kind of stay niche longer because people are like, oh, this is like just for them. They're obsessed with it, but that has nothing to do with me.
[00:23:33.140] 我认同这样的观点：当某件事物拥有狂热的粉丝群体时，这些人可能对它无比热爱，但这种热爱并不会渗透到主流文化中。有时候，如果人们对某件事物超级痴迷，我觉得它反而能更长时间地保持小众状态，因为人们会觉得，哦，这好像只是他们自己的爱好。他们痴迷于此，但这跟我没关系。
[00:23:55.440] So I feel like when Porter Robinson started incorporating a lot of Japanese culture in his music and he started really blowing up, I felt like it became kind of cool to talk about it. Cool to indulge in like quote unquote weeb culture. And that's why, you know, more people maybe came out of the shadows to like talk about their hobbies.
[00:23:55.440] 所以我觉得，当Porter Robinson开始在他的音乐中融入大量日本文化元素，并且迅速走红之后，谈论这些就变得很酷了。沉迷于所谓的“二次元文化”也变得很酷。正因如此，越来越多的人开始走出幕后，谈论他们的爱好。
[00:24:19.540] Or that's why maybe more people became interested in anime in the first place, which I know is kind of like shitty because, you know, anime is so famous and like a lot of Asian people were already indulging in it. So to be like, oh, this like white dude came out with like some music and then like it became mainstream is kind of a shitty thought. But sometimes that's like kind of how it works, in my opinion. It takes like one famous white person to like publicly acknowledge their interest in something and then people are like, oh, now it's like cool to enjoy it.
[00:24:19.540] 或许这就是为什么更多人最初对动漫感兴趣的原因，我知道这听起来有点糟糕，因为你知道，动漫本来就很流行，很多亚洲人早就开始喜欢上了。所以，如果说“哦，某个白人出了点音乐，然后它就流行起来了”，这种想法确实有点让人不舒服。但有时候，在我看来，事情就是这样发展的。只需要一个知名的白人公开承认自己对某件事感兴趣，人们就会觉得，“哦，现在喜欢它也很酷了。”
[00:24:48.540] But that's my controversial opinion. I think that makes sense, too, because probably when people were like, oh, my God, he's he's like incorporating anime stuff or whatever. A lot of people who are probably like already fans of this stuff were like, wow, like I feel embraced.
[00:24:48.540] 但这只是我个人的争议观点。我觉得这也有道理，因为当人们惊呼“我的天哪，他居然把动漫元素融入作品里了！”的时候，很多原本就是这类作品粉丝的人可能会觉得“哇，感觉被接纳了！”
[00:25:08.580] Yeah. And then probably even like people who weren't into anime and stuff like that, if they see their favorite artist or whatever being into this stuff, they're like, oh, maybe it's like cool to, you know, be into anime and things like that. That's cringe, though. Okay, I also thought of another anime that I watched when I was younger, which I did actually like a lot. Dragon Ball series. Oh.
[00:25:08.580] 是啊。甚至可能有些人本来就不看动漫，但如果他们看到自己喜欢的艺术家或者其他什么人也喜欢动漫，他们就会想，哦，喜欢动漫什么的好像也挺酷的。不过，这想法挺尴尬的。对了，我还想到我小时候看过的另一部动漫，我其实很喜欢。《龙珠》系列。哦。
[00:25:42.300] No, I think it's like a favorite for a lot of people just because they grew up with it. But I didn't watch it on TV or anything like that. So I cannot relate. But also, like, I know it's just like a nostalgic thing for a lot of people. But sometimes I see the art and I'm like, damn, they're so ugly. And I'm like, I don't think I could ever get into it.
[00:25:42.300] 不，我觉得很多人喜欢它只是因为他们从小就接触它。但我小时候没在电视上看过，所以没法感同身受。而且，我知道对很多人来说，它只是一种怀旧的东西。但有时候我看到它的画风，会觉得，天哪，真丑。然后我就想，我可能永远也欣赏不了它。
[00:26:09.290] I do think it's definitely like a nostalgia thing for sure. And it's also kind of funny because like the storylines in it, they get wilder and wilder as like the story progresses. The main guy, Goku, he just keeps dying, but then they just keep bringing him back. They like keep finding loopholes. They're like, oh, yeah, you're only allowed to bring him back to life like one time max. And then the next season or whatever, the next bad guy, they're like, we have to bring him back. Like there's a loophole.
[00:26:09.290] 我觉得这绝对是怀旧情结作祟。而且也挺搞笑的，因为剧情越往后发展越离谱。主角悟空，他总是死，但又总是复活。他们好像总能找到漏洞。他们会说，哦，对，你最多只能让他复活一次。然后到了下一季或者其他什么季，下一个反派，他们又会说，我们必须让他复活。好像总能找到漏洞似的。
[00:26:37.510] There's actually another set of Dragon Balls that we can use. It's just like it gets more and more crazy. And I think people like to think about it and like kind of make fun of it. How ridiculous it gets. I think in the same vein, like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is also appealing to people in that way. Not because like they, you know, pull shit out of their ass every season.
[00:26:37.510] 其实我们还有另一套龙珠可以用。这剧情真是越来越离谱了。我觉得大家喜欢琢磨这些，也喜欢拿这些剧情开玩笑，觉得它们荒诞得离谱。我觉得《JOJO的奇妙冒险》也是出于同样的道理吸引观众的。倒不是因为他们每季都胡编乱造。
[00:27:03.570] But like, but it's actually like if you watch it, you're like, how did I get from point A to point 10? You're watching it and then halfway through, you're like, wait, how the fuck did I get here? You know, this is kind of a random tangent, but JoJo's was also semi popular, I think, when we were growing up. And I used to really love this game called JoJo's Fashion Show. And there's like multiple editions of this game. And it's a really good game.
[00:27:03.570] 但其实，如果你看了这部动画，你会想，我是怎么从A点到10点的？你看着看着，看到一半，突然就懵了，等等，我到底是怎么到这儿的？你知道，这有点跑题了，但我觉得《JOJO的奇妙冒险》在我们小时候也挺火的。我以前特别喜欢玩一款叫《JOJO的时尚秀》的游戏。这款游戏有很多版本。而且真的很好玩。
[00:27:30.630] I was like playing this, you know, every night after high school or whatever. And then I would go to school and people were like, oh, like, I just started watching JoJo's or like, I love JoJo's. And I'd be like, oh, my God, like you guys play JoJo's too? They'd be like, no, it's like an anime. And I was like, oh, sorry. You're like, I'm just going to leave now. I'm like, yeah, no, love the anime. They have good fashion in the anime, though. Do you have any more inflection points?
[00:27:30.630] 我当时几乎每天晚上放学后都玩这个游戏。然后我去学校，同学们会说：“哦，我最近开始看《JOJO的奇妙冒险》了”或者“我超爱《JOJO的奇妙冒险》”。我就会说：“我的天哪，你们也玩《JOJO的奇妙冒险》吗？”他们会说：“不，那只是个动画。”然后我就说：“哦，不好意思。”他们可能会说：“那我先走了。”我说：“是啊，没事，我超爱这部动画。而且动画里的服装也很棒。”你还有其他的人生转折点吗？
[00:27:59.130] I think that was probably the two big ones that I was thinking of. But did you feel like you noticed any, Amber, since you were more in the culture at a young age? I did have one to add. I mean, I think you hit it pretty well. But I also feel like because I grew up in our area that it was just like, oh, people do watch anime. That it doesn't feel like it really got blown up.
[00:27:59.130] 我想那大概就是我想到的两点主要原因了。不过，Amber，你从小就接触动漫文化，有没有注意到其他方面的变化呢？我还有一点要补充。我觉得你说的很对。但我也觉得，因为我从小在我们这片区域长大，所以感觉就像是，哦，大家都看动漫。感觉动漫并没有真正火起来。
[00:28:26.550] But I definitely saw like, maybe it's just my algorithm or something. But right before COVID, I saw a lot of content on like Instagram and TikTok of like athletes, gym people being really into anime. And then they would kind of infuse that into their personality. Interesting. Yeah, but I don't know what prompted that at all. Interesting.
[00:28:26.550] 但我确实看到过，也许只是我的算法问题之类的。在新冠疫情爆发前，我在Instagram和TikTok上看到很多运动员、健身爱好者特别喜欢动漫的内容。然后他们似乎把这种爱好融入到了自己的个性中。挺有意思的。是啊，但我完全不知道是什么原因促使他们这么做的。挺有意思的。
[00:28:54.850] I wonder if it was like One Punch Man. Yeah. I remember that was like a big thing for a while. It's the main guy, right? And he's just like, yeah, I just do like 100 pushups every day and like run X amount of miles. And now I'm so strong. Yeah, I think there's that. And then, I mean, I guess in general, a lot of anime is like there's like hella buff dudes and like people that are hella strong and stuff. So they just kind of, oh, I can do that IRL.
[00:28:54.850] 我想知道是不是像《一拳超人》那样。对，我记得那部动画当时很火。主角就是那个，对吧？他每天做100个俯卧撑，跑几英里，然后就变得特别强壮。嗯，我觉得就是那种感觉。而且，我觉得很多动漫里都有那种肌肉发达、力大无穷的角色。所以大家就会觉得，哦，我现实生活中也能做到。
[00:29:24.550] Yeah, I could see that. I think another big moment for anime was when Naruto ended. I think a lot of people were talking about that. And I think they weren't afraid to talk about it because it was like a big event in the anime world. So I think that was another thing that I really noticed. Yeah. That was another one that was shown on like Cartoon Network when we were younger. So I think a lot of people would at least like recognize the name even if they weren't into anime.
[00:29:24.550] 是啊，我也有同感。我觉得动漫界另一个重要时刻是《火影忍者》完结的时候。当时很多人都在讨论这件事，而且他们也毫不避讳地谈论它，因为这在动漫界算是一件大事。所以我觉得这也是我注意到的一点。没错，我们小时候经常在卡通频道看到这部动画。所以我觉得即使不看动漫的人，至少也听说过它的名字。
[00:29:54.290] I even see people wearing like Naruto merch at the gym sometimes. Whoa. Whoa. But then it's like it's like kind of low key. So it's like you wouldn't know unless you've watched it before or like you know a little bit about it. If you know, you know kind of thing. Yeah, yeah. But then sometimes like you see it and you're like, okay. You're the gym anime people. Okay, good. Good thing you clarified because I was imagining them like wearing the headbands or something.
[00:29:54.290] 我甚至有时候在健身房看到有人穿火影忍者周边。哇哦。哇哦。不过感觉挺低调的。所以除非你以前看过或者稍微了解一下，否则你根本不会注意到。懂的人自然懂。对，对。但有时候你看到他们穿，就会想，好吧。你们是健身房里的动漫迷。好吧，不错。幸好你解释清楚了，不然我之前还以为他们会戴着护额什么的呢。
[00:30:25.230] He has the wig on. It was just like a pair of like the one that I saw the other day was like just a guy wearing a pair of shorts and it just had like a pattern from the show. Yeah. Oh my god. Actually, speaking of Naruto, the Naruto run kind of went viral. I remember that. That was probably another thing that helped expose a lot of people to anime in general. Like where's this run from? It's from this anime. Dude, I almost wonder if it was the opposite. Like, oh, this run is weird.
[00:30:25.230] 他戴着假发。就像我前几天看到的那种，一个男的穿着短裤，上面印着动画片里的图案。是啊。我的天。说到《火影忍者》，鸣人跑步的视频当时火了。我记得。那可能也是很多人接触到动漫的原因之一。比如，“这跑步视频是哪来的？”“是这部动画里的。” 哥们，我甚至怀疑是不是反过来了。比如，“哦，这跑步视频好奇怪。”
[00:30:54.970] I'm not touching anime with a 10-foot pole. Oh wait, that's true. I don't want to become them. I do kind of have a random question though, where we've been talking a lot about Naruto, which I know is like a very big anime. But I feel like even when something is really famous, there are still kind of like stereotypes that you might associate with like a hardcore Naruto fan or a hardcore JoJo's fan or etc, etc.
[00:30:54.970] 我可不想碰动漫。哦等等，确实如此。我可不想变成他们那样。不过我倒是有个有点跑题的问题，我们最近聊了很多关于《火影忍者》的话题，我知道它很火。但我觉得，即使某个作品非常有名，还是会有一些刻板印象，比如你会把铁杆火影迷、铁杆JOJO粉之类的联系起来。
[00:31:23.230] So do you have any kind of like associations like that with some of the bigger animes? I actually refused to watch Naruto for like the longest time. Just because I think just subconsciously maybe, because it was on Cartoon Network that I was kind of like, oh, it's just like an American cartoon. You know, it's not really an anime. But I mean, obviously it's not. Don't come for me.
[00:31:23.230] 所以你对某些热门动漫作品有类似的联想吗？其实我曾经很长一段时间都拒绝看《火影忍者》。可能是潜意识里吧，因为它在卡通频道播出，我就觉得，哦，它就是一部美国动画片，不算真正的日本动漫。但我的意思是，它当然不是。别来找我麻烦。
[00:31:52.950] You're like, shit, actually it's one of the most revered anime. But I think, you know, because it is on like kids TV, basically, I did feel like there's like a level of maybe immaturity to the anime that I was just kind of like, oh, it's just like for kids. It's just this guy that's like, you better believe it. I'm going to get stronger. I love my friends, you know? Shit, you're right.
[00:31:52.950] 你会想，我去，其实它是最受推崇的动画之一。但我觉得，你知道，因为它基本上是在儿童频道播出，我确实觉得这部动画有点不成熟，所以我就觉得，哦，这只是给小孩子看的。里面有个家伙总是说，你最好相信我，我会变得更强。我爱我的朋友们，你知道吗？我去，你说得对。
[00:32:22.230] And I did watch like some of it, I think up to where someone important died. And then I was just like, all right. It's like pretty much the same. You know, there's a new bad guy. They fight and then they're sad. And then, oh, but my friends make it all better. And they change outfits. Yeah. To show their progression. Only after like 10 years. So smelly.
[00:32:22.230] 我确实看了一部分，大概看到某个重要人物去世为止。然后我就觉得，好吧，剧情基本没变。你知道，又来了个新反派，他们打了一架，然后就伤心了。接着，哦，我的朋友们又让他们开心起来了。他们还换了身衣服。是啊，为了展现他们的成长。都过了十年了，真够臭的。
[00:32:50.550] You know what's also an anime that I think we forget is an anime? Pokemon. I was literally talking about this with Dustin yesterday. Mind blown. Oh my god. But it's also for babies. I think because like we're so used to seeing the English dubbed ones that we forget it's literally a Japanese anime. That is so interesting because the only exposure to like the Pokemon show that I had growing up was I had these two DVDs of Pokemon.
[00:32:50.550] 你知道还有一部动画我们经常会忘记它是动画吗？宝可梦。我昨天还跟达斯汀聊到这个呢。简直太震撼了。我的天哪。但它也是给小孩子看的。我觉得是因为我们看惯了英文配音版，所以忘了它其实是日本动画。这很有意思，因为我小时候接触宝可梦动画的唯一途径就是拥有两张宝可梦的DVD。
[00:33:19.690] And then on it, there's like pretty much one episode each. But I never realized that I was just watching like two episodes of anime over and over in my childhood. Like that is actually mind blowing. Because in my mind, I'm like, oh, it's like my DVD. I love to watch this DVD. Yeah. But it's literally like two episodes of Pokemon. That's so funny. I'll be honest. I never watched Pokemon. Dude, I watched like the whole first arc, I guess.
[00:33:19.690] 然后，里面几乎每部动画都只有一集。但我从来没意识到，我小时候竟然一直在反复看两集动画。这简直太不可思议了。因为在我的认知里，我会想，哦，这就像我的DVD一样。我喜欢看这张DVD。是啊。但实际上，里面只有两集宝可梦。这太搞笑了。说实话，我从来没看过宝可梦。哥们，我大概只看过第一部吧。
[00:33:48.710] Like the very beginning. And then the like first movie. Those were like pretty much the only that I watched. Wow. Well, I would catch like glimpses of it at daycare because they would just like have the TV on over the summer and then a bunch of kids would crowd in the room to watch Pokemon. For whatever reason, you know, if Pokemon was on, I was kind of like, eh, whatever.
[00:33:48.710] 就像最开始的时候。还有第一部电影。基本上我就只看过那些了。哇。嗯，我会在幼儿园偶尔瞥见一些，因为暑假期间他们会开着电视，然后一群小朋友就挤在房间里看宝可梦。不知道为什么，你知道，如果电视上在放宝可梦，我就觉得，嗯，随便吧。
[00:34:11.290] But then if it was, you know, American TV that I know is supposed to be on American TV, like Chowder or something like that, I was like, damn, that's lit. Wait, what is Chowder? Oh, it's not an anime. It was just like a TV show. Wait, you guys never seen Chowder? No. It's like some Cartoon Network cartoon, right? I vaguely, like the name sounds kind of familiar, but I don't think I ever watched it. Yeah, it's just like a purple dude. Really cute.
[00:34:11.290] 但如果是那种我知道应该在美国电视上播的美国电视节目，比如《Chowder》之类的，我就会想，哇，太棒了！等等，《Chowder》是什么？哦，它不是动画，就是一个电视节目。等等，你们都没看过《Chowder》？没有。好像是卡通频道播的动画片，对吧？我隐约觉得这个名字有点耳熟，但我好像从来没看过。对，就是一个紫色的小家伙，很可爱。
[00:34:40.270] Oh my god, I'm remembering like a bunch of random childhood animes now. Like Yu-Gi-Oh was also one. Mm-hmm. I think it was interesting though because from my memory, like it was only really that first season, I guess, that was shown or at least that I remember watching. And so I didn't realize it was like a long ass anime. I mean, Pokemon is still going on even now, I think. Wow. Or it might have just ended maybe. I don't know.
[00:34:40.270] 我的天啊，我现在突然想起好多小时候看过的动画。比如《游戏王》也是其中之一。嗯。我觉得挺有意思的，因为我印象中好像只看过第一季，或者至少我记得看过第一季。所以我之前没意识到它居然这么长。我的意思是，《精灵宝可梦》现在好像还在连载呢。哇。也可能已经完结了。我也不确定。
[00:35:09.770] And then Yu-Gi-Oh, I think is also still going on, right? I have no idea. But it's just, it's so interesting because at the time I kind of viewed it as like just an American cartoon because it was shown on Cartoon Network, similar to what you were saying, Amber. But then later it was like the realization happened like, oh, these are actually animes. So I wonder if that also factored into some of anime's popularity or maybe people were like 10, 15 years later,
[00:35:09.770] 然后，我觉得《游戏王》现在还在连载，对吧？我不太清楚。不过，这真的很有意思，因为当时我把它当成普通的美国动画片，因为它在卡通频道播出，就像你刚才说的，Amber。但后来我才意识到，哦，原来这些是日本动画。所以我在想，这是否也对日本动画的流行有所影响，或者说，人们在10年、15年后才意识到这一点。
[00:35:38.790] someone like makes them realize, oh, I was actually watching anime as a child. And then the genre suddenly feels less intimidating or foreign, I guess. Maybe. Because I feel like a lot of people really like Pokemon, especially because the like game franchise is really big. That's like a pretty normalized anime, if anything. Digimon also. Oh, yeah.
[00:35:38.790] 有人会让他们意识到，哦，我小时候其实看过动画。然后，我觉得这种类型突然就不那么让人望而生畏或陌生了。也许吧。因为我觉得很多人都很喜欢宝可梦，尤其是因为游戏系列非常火爆。如果非要说的话，它算是比较大众化的动画了。数码宝贝也是。哦，对。
[00:36:03.770] I watched like maybe two episodes of Pokemon or something, but I really cannot remember anything. Wait, maybe it was the movie. Oh. Where Pikachu was like, well, I guess Pikachu probably gets injured a lot. Was it the one where Mewtwo comes out? I wouldn't know. So I never really watched Cartoon Network growing up, but I definitely had some exposure, especially to Pokemon.
[00:36:03.770] 我大概看过两集宝可梦之类的动画，但真的什么都记不起来了。等等，也许是电影？哦，就是皮卡丘好像经常受伤的那部。是不是超梦登场的那部？我记不清了。我小时候其实没怎么看过卡通频道，但肯定接触过一些动画，尤其是宝可梦。
[00:36:29.410] But I remember one summer I went back to Korea and then my cousin was watching Pokemon. All of the names are different, right? Because it's like Korean dubbed. So Ash Ketchum, his name is like Jiwoo. I just looked it up and it's like Hanjiwoo. And then Misty, her name is Chae Isil. And then Brock's name is Woo. And I was like, I was like trying to familiarize myself with these names. And I was like, who the fuck? Like, I know that's Ash, but why do they keep saying Jiwoo?
[00:36:29.410] 但我记得有一年夏天我回韩国，我表哥在看《精灵宝可梦》。所有角色的名字都不一样，对吧？因为是韩语配音的。比如小智，他的名字好像是智宇（Jiwoo）。我查了一下，原来是韩智宇（Hanjiwoo）。然后小霞，她的名字是蔡伊西（Chae Isil）。小刚的名字是宇（Woo）。我就想，我当时就想，这都什么玩意儿？我知道那是小智，但为什么他们老是说智宇（Jiwoo）？
[00:36:58.770] And it was just like crazy. And I had like a really similar experience with Spongebob. Where Spongebob, like the Korean dub names are all different too. Okay, I think that makes sense though. Because apparently Ash's name in Japanese is not Ash. Oh. I would think so. Okay, so I just looked it up and it's Satoshi. Oh shit. How did they come up with Ash? Dude, I have no idea.
[00:36:58.770] 简直太疯狂了。我之前看海绵宝宝的时候也有过类似的经历。海绵宝宝的韩语配音版名字也都不一样。好吧，我觉得这说得通。因为小智的日语名字好像不是Ash。哦，我猜也是。好吧，我刚查了一下，是Satoshi。我去。他们是怎么想到用Ash这个名字的？老兄，我也不知道。
[00:37:29.050] Not even close. Speaking of Spongebob, in Mandarin, it's also like, I mean, it's kind of like Spongebob, but then they call him like Haimian Bao Bao, which is directly like Spongebob. Spongebob, like Spongebob, like Spongebob. Yeah. It's so cute. I just looked up the Spongebob names in Korean and I guess Spongebob is still like Suponjibab. And then his last name was just Squarepants, but like directly translated. But I always thought it was so mean that they called Patrick Doongi, which kind of is like
[00:37:29.050] 差远了。说到海绵宝宝，在普通话里，也差不多是这个意思，我的意思是，有点像海绵宝宝，但他们叫他“海面宝宝”，这跟海绵宝宝直接一样。海绵宝宝，就像海绵宝宝，就像海绵宝宝。对。太可爱了。我刚才查了一下海绵宝宝的韩语名字，我猜海绵宝宝还是像“Suponjibab”。然后他的姓就是“Squarepants”，直接翻译过来的。但我一直觉得他们叫派大星“Doongi”很过分，这有点像……
[00:37:58.810] fat ass, but in like a daring way. Holy shit. And then Squidward, his name is Jingjingi, which kind of means like complainer. Oh my God. I don't know. I was just like, damn, these are like sort of mean. Like, I don't know. Damn, but Spongebob, his reputation is intact. Yeah. Interesting. I wonder why they changed Pokemon's names. Because I'm thinking about like Yu-Gi-Oh! And I think they kept everyone's name.
[00:37:58.810] 屁股胖得吓人，不过是那种大胆的胖。我的天。还有章鱼哥，他的名字叫金金吉，听起来像是爱抱怨的人。我的老天。我不知道。我当时就想，妈的，这些名字有点刻薄。就像，我不知道。唉，不过海绵宝宝，他的名声倒是没变。是啊。有意思。我很好奇他们为什么要改宝可梦的名字。因为我想到了游戏王！我觉得他们保留了所有角色的名字。
[00:38:27.890] Except for that one dude, his name's Joey. I'm not sure if his Japanese name is still Joey. Wait, Joey is crazy. Dude, so Joey in Japanese version, his name is Katsuya Jinoki, I think. Whoa. That's crazy. Joey is close a little bit. And then his English name is Joseph Joey Wheeler. It's so white. Wait, yeah. He just became white. Yeah.
[00:38:27.890] 除了那个叫乔伊的家伙。我不确定他的日文名字是不是还叫乔伊。等等，乔伊疯了吧。哥们，所以日文版的乔伊，他的名字好像是金木胜也。哇哦。太疯狂了。乔伊这个名字还算接近。然后他的英文名字是约瑟夫·乔伊·惠勒。这名字真够白的。等等，对。他突然就变成白人了。没错。
[00:38:57.750] Dude, that's so funny. So Amber, as someone who loves anime, I have a final question for you, which is, do you feel like there have ever been any side effects from watching anime? And I do want to clarify, like, not side effects in a negative way, but how does watching anime kind of impact your life?
[00:38:57.750] 老兄，这太搞笑了。Amber，作为一个动漫爱好者，我最后一个问题想问你，你觉得看动漫有没有什么副作用？我想澄清一下，我说的不是负面的副作用，而是看动漫对你的生活有什么影响？
[00:39:18.450] I guess some examples could be like, have you ever felt an anime hangover where once you finish the anime, you're like, holy shit, I need to like sit and think about this and wallow in the after effects of this anime for a long time. Or maybe anime even opened up learning about the Japanese language or culture, etc, etc. So what have been your personal side effects? I see what you mean by hangovers now.
[00:39:18.450] 我想举几个例子，比如，你有没有过看完一部动漫后那种“后遗症”的感觉？就是看完之后，你会觉得“我的天哪，我需要好好坐下来思考一下，好好沉浸在这部动漫带来的余韵中很久”。或者，动漫甚至可能让你开始了解日语或日本文化等等。那么，你个人的“后遗症”是什么呢？我现在明白你说的“后遗症”是什么意思了。
[00:39:43.350] After I watch it, I don't necessarily need to like sit in it or anything. But then if I really, really like the anime, I'll feel like, oh my god, I need to find more animes that are like exactly like this. Which is really hard to find, actually, just because they're all a little bit different. And then even if they're kind of the same genre, like it might not really hook me in as much as the one that I really liked.
[00:39:43.350] 看完之后，我倒不一定非得沉浸其中什么的。但如果我真的非常喜欢这部动画，我就会觉得，天哪，我得赶紧去找更多类似的动画。其实这很难找，因为每部动画都略有不同。就算它们属于同一类型，也未必能像我喜欢的那部一样让我着迷。
[00:40:06.670] And there was like this one summer where I watched like one romance, kind of like slice of life romance anime. And then I was like, I need more. And then I just like spent that whole summer watching like romance anime. Oh my god. This is so funny. There's like an opposite of anime hangover. It's like anime addiction. No, literally though. Sometimes I like isekai genre.
[00:40:06.670] 有那么一个夏天，我看了一部恋爱番，就是那种日常系的恋爱番。然后我就觉得，我还需要更多。于是整个夏天我就都在看恋爱番了。我的天哪。这太搞笑了。这跟“动漫后遗症”正好相反，就像是“动漫上瘾”。不，我是认真的。有时候我也喜欢异世界题材的。
[00:40:34.570] After I watched Sword Art Online, I was like, oh my god, I need to find like another one that's like this. But I feel like I can only think of like one other one that is like that right now. Yeah, it's really hard to like find one that's like exactly kind of like what you're looking for. So isekai is the like reborn shit, right? The stuff that I supposedly would enjoy. Yeah. And Sword Art Online is, it's kind of like VR.
[00:40:34.570] 看完《刀剑神域》之后，我就想，天哪，我得找一部类似的。但我现在感觉只能想到一部类似的。是啊，要找到一部完全符合自己口味的作品真的很难。所以异世界题材就是那种重生之类的，对吧？就是那种我应该会喜欢的类型。没错。《刀剑神域》有点像VR。
[00:41:00.290] But then it's kind of like that episode in Black Mirror where they put on their little goggles and then they are like in a new world. Except in the anime, you can like live there for an extended period of time or something like that. Interesting. Yeah. Oh, is that why it's Sword Art Online? Yeah. Oh, dude. Okay. For the longest time, whenever I heard the anime name Sword Art Online, I was like literally like Sword Art Online?
[00:41:00.290] 但感觉有点像《黑镜》里有一集，他们戴上护目镜就进入了一个新世界。只不过在动画里，你可以在那里生活很长时间之类的。有意思。是啊。哦，所以才叫《刀剑神域》？对。哦，老兄。好吧。很长一段时间以来，每次听到《刀剑神域》这个动画名字，我都会想：《刀剑神域》？
[00:41:29.030] Like I didn't realize it was an anime. I think the game in the anime is called Sword Art Online. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crystal's imagining like an eBay, but it's just for artwork. That's about swords. Exactly. I was like, why are people so obsessed with Sword Art Online? Why not offline?
[00:41:29.030] 我之前都没意识到这是部动画。动画里的游戏好像叫《刀剑神域》。对对对。Crystal把它想象成一个类似eBay的网站，只不过是卖艺术品的。而且是关于剑的。没错。我就想，为什么大家这么痴迷《刀剑神域》？为什么现实生活中就不这么喜欢呢？
[00:41:55.250] You know, after watching anime for so long, like maybe I can understand like some phrases, but they're not even like really practical. I think because they're so like dramatized in anime. If I look away while watching anime, I will not understand what's going on. I'll be honest. I did always think it was cool. Like a lot of my friends who have really loved anime, especially at like a younger age, they ended up picking up how to read Japanese and speak the language.
[00:41:55.250] 你知道，看了这么久的动漫，虽然我能听懂一些短语，但它们其实并不实用。我觉得是因为动漫里的情节太戏剧化了。如果我看动漫的时候走神，就完全看不懂剧情了。说实话，我一直觉得动漫很酷。我的很多朋友，尤其是从小就喜欢动漫的朋友，最后都学会了日语，会读会说。
[00:42:24.830] And some of my friends have even like gone to visit Japan and they were like, yeah, the knowledge that I have that was jumpstarted from my love for anime. I was able to like use that and actually like live there or like be there for long periods of time and communicate with people. And I was like, dude, this is like every Asian mom's dream. You know what I mean? Like having your kid pick up a language to the point where they're like almost fluent. So I guess that's like the takeaway. Like make your kids watch anime and maybe they'll learn Japanese.
[00:42:24.830] 我有些朋友甚至去过日本，他们说，是啊，我对日语的了解很大程度上源于我对动漫的热爱。我能够利用这份热爱，在日本生活，或者在那里待很长时间，和当地人交流。我就想，老兄，这简直是每个亚洲妈妈的梦想。你懂我的意思吗？就像让孩子掌握一门语言，直到他们几乎能说一口流利的程度。所以我觉得这就是我想说的。让你的孩子看动漫，说不定他们就能学会日语。
[00:42:53.710] And then they can be your tour guide in Japan. True. True. I think I have to try harder. All right. Well, this was a fun conversation about anime, especially as someone who doesn't know too much about it and has only watched very select few about it. It was fun to discuss kind of how anime has played a role in our lives and how we've unknowingly been enjoying anime all of our lives.
[00:42:53.710] 然后他们就可以做你在日本的导游了。没错。没错。我觉得我得更努力才行。好吧。嗯，这次关于动漫的对话很有趣，尤其是对于我这种不太了解动漫，只看过几部的人来说。讨论动漫在我们生活中扮演的角色，以及我们如何在不知不觉中享受着动漫，真的很有意思。
