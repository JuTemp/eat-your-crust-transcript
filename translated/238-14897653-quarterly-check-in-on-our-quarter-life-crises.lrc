[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。
[00:00:16.000] We're back with some life updates. And personally, my life updates are more like crises.
[00:00:16.000] 我们又来更新生活近况了。就我个人而言，我的生活近况更像是危机。
[00:00:24.000] Same. And I don't know what it is about this year, but I feel like now that we've wrapped up Q1, not to go all corporate,
[00:00:24.000] 一样。我不知道今年是怎么回事，但感觉现在第一季度结束了，虽然不想说得太正式，
[00:00:33.000] but this year just feels a little bit different to me. I don't know if it's our age or just how many years it's been since we've left high school or things like that,
[00:00:33.000] 但今年给我的感觉有点不一样。我不知道是不是因为我们年纪大了，还是因为我们离开高中已经很多年了，或者诸如此类的原因。
[00:00:41.000] but I just feel so many things all the time.
[00:00:41.000] 但我时时刻刻都感觉五味杂陈。
[00:00:45.000] Oh my God. Yeah, I totally agree. My theory right now, which kind of ties into my crisis is that we're kind of at the age where no one needs to tell us what to do anymore.
[00:00:45.000] 我的天哪。是啊，我完全同意。我现在的想法，其实也跟我遇到的危机有点关系，就是我们好像到了一个不需要别人告诉我们该做什么的年纪了。
[00:00:59.000] And so we don't know.
[00:00:59.000] 所以我们不得而知。
[00:01:02.000] Like we're kind of just feeling around and we're like, oh shoot, life is different now. We don't just do whatever society tells us anymore.
[00:01:02.000] 就像我们现在有点摸不着头脑，然后突然意识到，哎呀，生活不一样了。我们不能再像以前那样听从社会的安排了。
[00:01:11.000] We have much more freedom. So that's kind of how I've been feeling lately.
[00:01:11.000] 我们拥有了更多的自由。这就是我最近的感觉。
[00:01:17.000] I'm trying to like lead my most authentic life and basically do things that I want to do.
[00:01:17.000] 我努力过上最真实的生活，基本上就是做自己想做的事情。
[00:01:23.000] And I realized that our whole life leading up to early to mid-20s, a lot of it is kind of predetermined as in our parents wanted us to go to school,
[00:01:23.000] 我意识到，我们二十岁出头到二十五岁左右的整个人生，很多事情都是预先注定的，比如我们的父母希望我们上学。
[00:01:35.000] you know, go to college, get a degree. Generally, us and our friends followed that path and then, you know, get a job.
[00:01:35.000] 你知道，上大学，拿到学位。通常，我们和我们的朋友都走了这条路，然后，你知道，找份工作。
[00:01:41.000] And then after that, it's like, okay now I don't know what to do anymore.
[00:01:41.000] 然后，之后我就想，好吧，现在我不知道该怎么办了。
[00:01:45.000] Yeah, it's kind of interesting because I know a couple episodes ago we talked about how everyone's paths kind of diverging off in our mid-20s
[00:01:45.000] 是的，这挺有意思的，因为我知道在前几期节目里我们讨论过，大家的人生轨迹在二十五六岁的时候就开始分岔了。
[00:01:54.000] gives us the empowerment and the ability to be really appreciating our own lives and not comparing ourselves to others.
[00:01:54.000] 这赋予我们力量和能力，让我们真正欣赏自己的生活，而不是与他人比较。
[00:02:01.000] But I do feel like the opposite end of that spectrum is okay, I am no longer getting handheld on every step of my life.
[00:02:01.000] 但我确实觉得这种光谱的另一端也挺好，我不再需要事事都有人照顾了。
[00:02:10.000] So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[00:02:10.000] 那我到底该怎么办？
[00:02:12.000] Exactly. That is how I'm feeling a lot of these days now because I'm like, okay, well, you know, I get up, I go to work, come home,
[00:02:12.000] 没错。我现在很多时候就是这种感觉，因为我会想，好吧，你知道，我起床，去上班，回家，
[00:02:23.000] I don't know, like watch some TV or something and then eventually like wrap up, go to sleep.
[00:02:23.000] 我不知道，可能看看电视什么的，然后最后就收拾好，睡觉吧。
[00:02:29.000] And then I'm like, oh, I guess like I should probably be doing more, right?
[00:02:29.000] 然后我就想，哦，我想我应该做得更多，对吧？
[00:02:34.000] I know what you mean. I feel like I'm always vacillating between I'm not doing enough and like I'm doing too much.
[00:02:34.000] 我明白你的意思。我感觉自己总是在两种状态之间摇摆不定：要么觉得自己做得不够，要么觉得自己做得太多。
[00:02:40.000] And I just constantly like seesaw back and forth between those two feelings.
[00:02:40.000] 我就像跷跷板一样，不断地在这两种感觉之间摇摆不定。
[00:02:44.000] Yeah, and I think one big thing that I'm starting to practice out of all this is to really think about if what I'm doing is what I want.
[00:02:44.000] 是的，我觉得我从这一切中开始实践的一件重要事情就是认真思考我正在做的事情是否是我想要的。
[00:02:54.000] So literally like rethinking everything in life.
[00:02:54.000] 简直就像重新思考生活中的一切。
[00:02:59.000] I know it sounds dramatic, but I think it's kind of necessary.
[00:02:59.000] 我知道这听起来有点夸张，但我认为这有点必要。
[00:03:03.000] So to go through all the basics, first one is probably work because that takes up the majority of our lives right now.
[00:03:03.000] 所以，要说所有基本方面，首先可能是工作，因为工作占据了我们目前生活的大部分时间。
[00:03:11.000] Is this a job that I want? And is this a job that still brings joy?
[00:03:11.000] 这是我想要的工作吗？这份工作还能给我带来快乐吗？
[00:03:16.000] And if it's not, why am I in this job?
[00:03:16.000] 如果不是这样，那我为什么会从事这份工作？
[00:03:20.000] Is it because someone else told me to be in it?
[00:03:20.000] 是因为别人让我参加吗？
[00:03:22.000] Is it because, you know, I'm satisfying someone else's expectation of myself when I should be satisfying my own expectation of myself?
[00:03:22.000] 是不是因为我满足了别人对我的期望，而我本应该满足自己对自己的期望？
[00:03:32.000] That's a really big one, especially for our age.
[00:03:32.000] 这可是件大事，尤其对我们这个年纪的人来说。
[00:03:35.000] And I feel like especially now that we're going back into the office and stuff and work is taking up a bigger majority of our lives,
[00:03:35.000] 我觉得尤其现在我们都要回办公室上班了，工作占据了我们生活的大部分时间，
[00:03:42.000] it does feel like more of an essential question.
[00:03:42.000] 这确实感觉像是一个至关重要的问题。
[00:03:44.000] Like do I get along with my coworkers? Do I like this team? Do I like these projects?
[00:03:44.000] 我跟同事相处得怎么样？我喜欢这个团队吗？我喜欢这些项目吗？
[00:03:48.000] Do I feel fulfilled by the things that I do?
[00:03:48.000] 我所做的事情能让我感到满足吗？
[00:03:50.000] And if not, then what's next? Like what are next steps basically?
[00:03:50.000] 如果不行，那接下来该怎么办？基本上，下一步该怎么做？
[00:03:54.000] Exactly. I actually talked to my therapist about this a lot.
[00:03:54.000] 没错。我其实跟我的心理咨询师聊过很多次这个问题。
[00:03:58.000] She explained to me like, you don't have to make big changes all the time as well.
[00:03:58.000] 她向我解释说，你也不必总是做出大的改变。
[00:04:03.000] If you're starting to realize that a certain aspect of life isn't what you want,
[00:04:03.000] 如果你开始意识到生活的某个方面并非你所愿，
[00:04:08.000] she basically described this pretty interesting analogy to me.
[00:04:08.000] 她向我描述了一个非常有趣的比喻。
[00:04:12.000] Right now in life, you're basically in a cereal aisle and you can try anything you want.
[00:04:12.000] 现在的人生，你就像置身于超市的谷物货架前，可以随心所欲地尝试任何你想尝试的东西。
[00:04:18.000] Like no one's stopping you except for yourself, pretty much.
[00:04:18.000] 基本上，除了你自己，没有人能阻止你。
[00:04:22.000] You don't have to suddenly take a jump from like Cheerios to like Cookie Crisps,
[00:04:22.000] 你没必要突然从喜欢麦片圈之类的零食一下子转到喜欢曲奇脆片之类的零食。
[00:04:29.000] something that's like completely out of your realm.
[00:04:29.000] 完全超出你能力范围的事情。
[00:04:31.000] You can definitely stick to one genre I guess of cereal and try new things within there
[00:04:31.000] 你完全可以坚持选择一种类型的麦片，然后在这个类型里尝试新的口味。
[00:04:39.000] before considering moving on and trying a different type of cereal.
[00:04:39.000] 在考虑尝试其他类型的麦片之前。
[00:04:46.000] So she was like, you know, you don't have to make any rash decisions right now,
[00:04:46.000] 所以她就说，你知道，你现在没必要做出任何草率的决定。
[00:04:49.000] but you should definitely evaluate if the things you're doing is what you want
[00:04:49.000] 但你一定要好好评估一下，你现在做的事情是否是你真正想要的。
[00:04:53.000] and if you want to try new things.
[00:04:53.000] 如果你想尝试新事物。
[00:04:55.000] I was like, huh, I guess that makes a lot of sense.
[00:04:55.000] 我当时想，嗯，这很有道理。
[00:04:59.000] So we should look for our honey nut Cheerios so much essentially.
[00:04:59.000] 所以我们应该多多寻找我们的蜂蜜坚果麦片。
[00:05:04.000] Yeah. I like that analogy a lot because I feel like if you think about the logistics behind every decision,
[00:05:04.000] 是的。我很喜欢这个比喻，因为我觉得如果你仔细思考每个决定背后的逻辑，
[00:05:10.000] it can sometimes like tie you down to staying in the status quo.
[00:05:10.000] 它有时会让你被束缚在现状中。
[00:05:13.000] If I want to go back to grad school, for example,
[00:05:13.000] 例如，如果我想重返研究生院，
[00:05:16.000] I feel like my brain instantly goes to, oh, how many years of income am I losing out on
[00:05:16.000] 我的大脑立刻就会想到，哦，我损失了多少年的收入？
[00:05:20.000] or will this truly benefit me or what's the return after X number of years?
[00:05:20.000] 或者，这样做真的对我有益吗？几年后能获得什么回报？
[00:05:25.000] Like who's going to pay the bills while I'm in school or things like that.
[00:05:25.000] 比如我上学期间谁来支付账单之类的问题。
[00:05:28.000] But I feel like it doesn't always have to be so drastic like your therapist said.
[00:05:28.000] 但我感觉事情不一定非要像你的治疗师说的那样极端。
[00:05:32.000] And I feel like it's a good way to kind of remind yourself that little decisions can eventually add up too.
[00:05:32.000] 我觉得这也能很好地提醒自己，小小的决定最终也会累积成大事。
[00:05:37.000] So it doesn't have to be one huge change.
[00:05:37.000] 所以不必进行一次巨大的改变。
[00:05:39.000] It can be small choices day by day.
[00:05:39.000] 这可能是每天的一些小选择。
[00:05:41.000] Exactly.
[00:05:41.000] 确切地。
[00:05:42.000] I've been reevaluating my life.
[00:05:42.000] 我一直在重新审视自己的人生。
[00:05:45.000] And I feel like that really makes me feel like I'm going through just a long standing quarter life crisis.
[00:05:45.000] 我觉得这让我感觉自己好像正在经历一场旷日持久的四分之一人生危机。
[00:05:53.000] I think at one point I was talking to my therapist.
[00:05:53.000] 我想我曾经和我的心理治疗师谈过这件事。
[00:05:57.000] I was like, oh my God, I'm having a quarter life crisis, aren't I?
[00:05:57.000] 我当时想，我的天哪，我这是要经历四分之一人生危机了吗？
[00:06:00.000] And she was like, well, I wouldn't call it a crisis.
[00:06:00.000] 她当时说，嗯，我不会称之为危机。
[00:06:03.000] Like you're still functioning okay.
[00:06:03.000] 感觉你一切正常。
[00:06:05.000] So, you know, I was like, oh, okay.
[00:06:05.000] 所以，你知道，我当时就想，哦，好吧。
[00:06:08.000] But like I'm still having this crisis.
[00:06:08.000] 但我感觉自己仍然深陷这场危机之中。
[00:06:11.000] Dude, I feel like you're right though.
[00:06:11.000] 兄弟，我觉得你说得对。
[00:06:13.000] This is the perfect age because I think until you really hit your late 20s,
[00:06:13.000] 这是个完美的年龄，因为我觉得直到你真正接近30岁的时候，
[00:06:18.000] you're kind of just like fighting for your life,
[00:06:18.000] 你感觉就像是在为生存而战，
[00:06:20.000] like really learning how to be a worker,
[00:06:20.000] 就像真正学习如何成为一名员工一样，
[00:06:22.000] like learning what it's like to live without your parents
[00:06:22.000] 比如体验没有父母的生活。
[00:06:25.000] and like all these things that you're kind of getting used to.
[00:06:25.000] 就像所有这些你逐渐习惯的事情一样。
[00:06:28.000] And I feel like now we're just like used to it.
[00:06:28.000] 我觉得我们现在已经习以为常了。
[00:06:30.000] So then your brain wanders and I'm like, what can I fix?
[00:06:30.000] 于是我的思绪就开始游离，我就想，我能解决什么问题呢？
[00:06:33.000] Like what do I need to change?
[00:06:33.000] 我需要做出哪些改变？
[00:06:35.000] Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:35.000] 对，没错。
[00:06:37.000] And a couple of episodes we talked about partying
[00:06:37.000] 还有几集我们聊到了派对。
[00:06:40.000] and having a check-in with yourself.
[00:06:40.000] 并进行自我反思。
[00:06:43.000] You know that moment when you go to the bathroom
[00:06:43.000] 你知道那种去洗手间的情景吗？
[00:06:45.000] and you look at yourself in the mirror,
[00:06:45.000] 你看着镜子里的自己，
[00:06:47.000] you're like am I okay right now?
[00:06:47.000] 你就像在问自己：我现在还好吗？
[00:06:49.000] I feel like I'm having that right now,
[00:06:49.000] 我觉得我现在就有这种感觉。
[00:06:51.000] but in the concept of life...
[00:06:51.000] 但在生命的概念中……
[00:06:55.000] Like you're in life's bathroom right now.
[00:06:55.000] 就像你现在身处人生的洗手间一样。
[00:06:57.000] Yes, and I'm looking at myself like, am I okay right now?
[00:06:57.000] 是的，我看着自己，心想，我现在还好吗？
[00:07:01.000] What is the next step?
[00:07:01.000] 下一步是什么？
[00:07:02.000] I'm like talking to myself
[00:07:02.000] 我感觉自己像是在自言自语。
[00:07:04.000] and giving myself a pep talk for what the next step is.
[00:07:04.000] 然后给自己打气，思考下一步该怎么做。
[00:07:08.000] And I've thought a lot about it
[00:07:08.000] 我对此思考了很多。
[00:07:10.000] and I think I have come to an interesting realization.
[00:07:10.000] 我想我得出了一个有趣的结论。
[00:07:13.000] Right now I'm living at home with my parents
[00:07:13.000] 我现在和父母住在一起。
[00:07:15.000] and I have been ever since I moved back from New York.
[00:07:15.000] 自从我从纽约搬回来后，就一直是这样。
[00:07:18.000] It's been really nice because it's like
[00:07:18.000] 这真的很好，因为它就像……
[00:07:20.000] I get to spend time with my family.
[00:07:20.000] 我可以和家人共度时光。
[00:07:22.000] They're really easy to live with.
[00:07:22.000] 它们真的很容易相处。
[00:07:24.000] We all are kind of introverts so we just do our own thing
[00:07:24.000] 我们都是比较内向的人，所以我们都各自忙自己的事。
[00:07:27.000] and they're not super naggy to me.
[00:07:27.000] 而且他们也不会对我特别唠叨。
[00:07:30.000] But as I reflect on where I am in life
[00:07:30.000] 但当我反思自己的人生现状时，我意识到自己身处何方。
[00:07:35.000] and kind of having that mirror moment with myself,
[00:07:35.000] 感觉就像在照镜子一样，与自己进行了一次对话。
[00:07:38.000] I'm like oh I'm literally about to be 28
[00:07:38.000] 我心想，哦，我马上就要28岁了。
[00:07:41.000] and I'm living at home
[00:07:41.000] 我住在家里
[00:07:44.000] and it's kind of like those stereotypes from when we were younger.
[00:07:44.000] 这有点像我们小时候接触到的那些刻板印象。
[00:07:48.000] It's like oh I don't want to be that 30 year old
[00:07:48.000] 感觉就像，哦，我不想成为那个30岁的人。
[00:07:50.000] still living in my parents basement,
[00:07:50.000] 仍然住在父母家的地下室里，
[00:07:52.000] that kind of thing.
[00:07:52.000] 诸如此类的事情。
[00:07:54.000] Which I feel like it's different
[00:07:54.000] 我觉得这不一样。
[00:07:56.000] in this current economic climate nowadays,
[00:07:56.000] 在当前的经济环境下，
[00:07:59.000] especially in the Bay Area where living at home with your parents
[00:07:59.000] 尤其是在湾区，和父母住在一起更是如此。
[00:08:02.000] is a lot more common.
[00:08:02.000] 这种情况更为常见。
[00:08:04.000] But it does kind of give you that sense like oh shoot,
[00:08:04.000] 但这确实会给你一种“糟了”的感觉。
[00:08:07.000] maybe I'm missing out on other parts of life.
[00:08:07.000] 或许我错过了生活中的其他美好。
[00:08:10.000] So I thought about it.
[00:08:10.000] 于是我仔细考虑了一下。
[00:08:11.000] I was like okay pros and cons,
[00:08:11.000] 我当时就想，好吧，权衡一下利弊吧。
[00:08:13.000] staying at home, saving money versus moving out sooner
[00:08:13.000] 待在家里省钱，而不是早点搬出去。
[00:08:16.000] and maybe slowing down the saving process.
[00:08:16.000] 或许还会减慢储蓄进程。
[00:08:20.000] And what I've kind of come to the conclusion of
[00:08:20.000] 我得出的结论是……
[00:08:23.000] is that in New York I was building a certain momentum in life
[00:08:23.000] 在纽约，我的人生正逐渐步入正轨。
[00:08:27.000] but then coming back to the Bay,
[00:08:27.000] 但回到海湾后，
[00:08:29.000] I kind of fell off that track
[00:08:29.000] 我有点偏离了那条轨道。
[00:08:31.000] or like I paused the momentum
[00:08:31.000] 或者就像我暂停了这股势头一样。
[00:08:33.000] because readjusting to the Bay,
[00:08:33.000] 因为需要重新适应海湾地区，
[00:08:36.000] living at home, kind of reverting to like an old self
[00:08:36.000] 住在家里，感觉有点像回到了以前的自己。
[00:08:40.000] versus becoming a new self.
[00:08:40.000] 与成为全新的自己相对。
[00:08:43.000] I had a talk with my parents
[00:08:43.000] 我和父母谈了一次。
[00:08:45.000] and I was like I might try to move out by the end of the year
[00:08:45.000] 我当时就想，我或许会在年底前搬出去。
[00:08:48.000] and they were like oh you don't want to keep saving money at home?
[00:08:48.000] 他们就说，哦，你不想继续在家存钱吗？
[00:08:54.000] But they take the news well generally?
[00:08:54.000] 但他们总体上都能很好地接受这个消息吗？
[00:08:57.000] Yes, I had to pull out some tactics to convince them a little bit.
[00:08:57.000] 是的，我不得不使出一些手段来稍微说服他们一下。
[00:09:04.000] One I was like oh dude like you know most of our friends
[00:09:04.000] 我当时就想，哦，老兄，你知道我们的大多数朋友
[00:09:08.000] like family friends as well as my high school or college friends
[00:09:08.000] 就像家人朋友以及我的高中或大学朋友一样。
[00:09:11.000] don't really live at home anymore.
[00:09:11.000] 我已经不住在家里了。
[00:09:13.000] It's really good for growing your independence
[00:09:13.000] 它对培养你的独立性真的很有好处。
[00:09:15.000] and responsibility, all those kinds of excuses.
[00:09:15.000] 还有责任感，以及所有这些借口。
[00:09:19.000] And they're like hmm okay but at this point
[00:09:19.000] 他们就表示，嗯，好吧，但到了这个地步……
[00:09:22.000] they were still like a little skeptical right?
[00:09:22.000] 他们当时还是有点怀疑，对吧？
[00:09:24.000] Because they're like dude you could just save at home
[00:09:24.000] 因为他们会说，哥们，你完全可以在家省钱啊。
[00:09:26.000] and then I know your goal eventually was to like you know purchase property
[00:09:26.000] 我知道你最终的目标是购买房产。
[00:09:30.000] and then I was like dude but like the HOAs right now are fucking insane
[00:09:30.000] 然后我就想，老兄，现在的业主协会简直疯了。
[00:09:36.000] not to mention the high like mortgage rates.
[00:09:36.000] 更别提高昂的抵押贷款利率了。
[00:09:40.000] I also told them and I think this one kind of shook them a bit.
[00:09:40.000] 我还告诉了他们，我觉得这件事让他们有点震惊。
[00:09:44.000] I was like hey when you were 28
[00:09:44.000] 我当时就想，嘿，你28岁的时候呢？
[00:09:47.000] you both got married and moved out of the country.
[00:09:47.000] 你们俩结婚后搬到了国外。
[00:09:50.000] Whoa, damn you used their past against them.
[00:09:50.000] 哇，你竟然利用他们的过去来对付他们！
[00:09:56.000] They kind of went quiet after that and they were like oh okay.
[00:09:56.000] 之后他们就安静了下来，然后就好像“哦，好吧”一样。
[00:10:02.000] So you successfully broke up with them as roommates?
[00:10:02.000] 所以你成功地和他们断绝了室友关系？
[00:10:05.000] Yes exactly.
[00:10:05.000] 没错，正是如此。
[00:10:08.000] But they were kind of like oh but like no rush to leave right?
[00:10:08.000] 但他们的态度好像是，哦，不过不用急着走，对吧？
[00:10:12.000] And I was like yeah sure.
[00:10:12.000] 我当时就想，是啊，当然可以。
[00:10:14.000] And my mom was like since your goal is to live alone
[00:10:14.000] 我妈妈说，既然你的目标是独居，那我就说。
[00:10:16.000] make sure you find like a safe neighborhood blah blah blah
[00:10:16.000] 确保你找到一个安全的社区等等等等
[00:10:19.000] and I was like yeah yeah you know of course don't worry about it.
[00:10:19.000] 我当时就说，是啊是啊，当然不用担心。
[00:10:23.000] Well that is a very exciting culmination of the quarter life crisis that you've been having.
[00:10:23.000] 嗯，这真是你经历的四分之一人生危机的一个非常激动人心的最终结果。
[00:10:28.000] A lot of self reflection and facing reality maybe?
[00:10:28.000] 或许需要大量的自我反省和直面现实？
[00:10:34.000] I think that's an interesting way to put it and I am first of all very excited for you
[00:10:34.000] 我觉得这种说法很有意思，首先我真心为你感到兴奋。
[00:10:39.000] and I'm also curious to see what kind of new chapter this will open up in your life
[00:10:39.000] 我也很好奇这会在你的生活中开启怎样的新篇章。
[00:10:43.000] if it'll make it easier for you to feel in tune with yourself
[00:10:43.000] 如果这能让你更容易与自己和谐相处的话。
[00:10:47.000] and your priorities and your decisions if it'll open up new doors etc.
[00:10:47.000] 以及你的优先事项和决定，例如它是否会为你打开新的大门等等。
[00:10:51.000] So hopefully all of those things come true.
[00:10:51.000] 希望这些愿望都能实现。
[00:10:54.000] Hopefully and hopefully it'll happen sooner than later.
[00:10:54.000] 但愿如此，但愿它能尽快发生。
[00:10:59.000] I gave myself till the end of the year to not feel too rushed
[00:10:59.000] 我给自己留出时间，直到年底，以免感到太匆忙。
[00:11:02.000] but you know I kind of am very like sporadic sometimes
[00:11:02.000] 但你知道，我有时候挺没规律的。
[00:11:07.000] like the New York move was like within two weeks alright I'm out of here
[00:11:07.000] 就像搬到纽约那样，两周之内我就决定离开这里。
[00:11:12.000] but now it's like oh shoot did I give myself too long of a timeline?
[00:11:12.000] 但现在感觉就像，糟了，我给自己设定的时间是不是太长了？
[00:11:16.000] Like can't become complacent in the middle of this?
[00:11:16.000] 难道在这种时候就不能掉以轻心吗？
[00:11:19.000] It's okay maybe you'll surprise yourself.
[00:11:19.000] 没关系，也许你会给自己带来惊喜。
[00:11:22.000] So I'm thinking of my personal quarter life crisis
[00:11:22.000] 所以，我在思考我个人的四分之一人生危机。
[00:11:25.000] and I feel like it's almost like two sides of the same coin
[00:11:25.000] 我觉得这就像一枚硬币的两面。
[00:11:29.000] where I am also thinking about my decisions in life
[00:11:29.000] 我同时也在思考我人生中的一些决定。
[00:11:34.000] but I feel like the feeling that I've been having is
[00:11:34.000] 但我感觉我一直有的这种感觉是
[00:11:39.000] I just feel so chased all the time
[00:11:39.000] 我总感觉自己被追赶着。
[00:11:41.000] whether I feel chased on time, chased on obligations
[00:11:41.000] 无论我是否感到时间紧迫，还是义务繁重，我都感到被催促着。
[00:11:45.000] all of these different things and I just always feel like I'm running
[00:11:45.000] 所有这些不同的事情，我总感觉自己一直在奔跑。
[00:11:49.000] or like sprinting maybe is the better word
[00:11:49.000] 或者用“冲刺”这个词可能更贴切。
[00:11:52.000] and I think it's just like freaking me out a little bit
[00:11:52.000] 我觉得这有点吓到我了。
[00:11:55.000] because I'm like I have all these things that I need to do
[00:11:55.000] 因为我觉得自己有很多事情要做。
[00:11:58.000] which I feel like it's constantly on my mind
[00:11:58.000] 我感觉这件事一直萦绕在我的脑海里。
[00:12:00.000] because I'm just that kind of a person
[00:12:00.000] 因为我就是那种人。
[00:12:02.000] but the execution side of me is very weak
[00:12:02.000] 但我执行力很弱。
[00:12:06.000] and I have like this long to-do list
[00:12:06.000] 我还有一张很长的待办事项清单。
[00:12:08.000] and I just can't bring myself to like lock in
[00:12:08.000] 我就是无法让自己像锁门一样待着
[00:12:11.000] and sit down and do all these things
[00:12:11.000] 然后坐下来做所有这些事
[00:12:13.000] and I think coupled with this feeling of like oh god there's so much to do
[00:12:13.000] 我觉得再加上这种“天哪，有太多事情要做”的感觉，就更难熬了。
[00:12:18.000] is always that nagging feeling of how come everyone else looks like they're doing fine
[00:12:18.000] 总会有那么一种挥之不去的念头：为什么其他人看起来都过得很好？
[00:12:25.000] and I'm the only one who's like freaked out by all this shit on my to-do list
[00:12:25.000] 只有我一个人对待办事项清单上的这些破事感到不知所措。
[00:12:30.000] no one else seems like they're freaking out
[00:12:30.000] 其他人似乎都没惊慌失措。
[00:12:32.000] people are getting stuff done in life
[00:12:32.000] 人们在生活中做着各种各样的事情
[00:12:34.000] going traveling and you know moving jobs
[00:12:34.000] 去旅行，还有搬家工作
[00:12:37.000] and going back to school and doing all these things fine
[00:12:37.000] 然后重返校园，把所有这些事情都做好。
[00:12:40.000] but for me when it comes to my to-do list
[00:12:40.000] 但对我来说，说到我的待办事项清单时……
[00:12:43.000] I feel like every single day goes by
[00:12:43.000] 感觉每一天都过得飞快。
[00:12:45.000] and I'm not checking off like a single task
[00:12:45.000] 我不是在逐项完成任务。
[00:12:48.000] maybe you have big goals
[00:12:48.000] 或许你有着远大的目标
[00:12:52.000] I think that could definitely be true
[00:12:52.000] 我认为这绝对有可能。
[00:12:54.000] but there's just something about all these things that I want to do
[00:12:54.000] 但我就是对所有这些事情都充满热情，想去做。
[00:12:59.000] where I think I'm just so freaked out
[00:12:59.000] 我觉得自己真是吓坏了。
[00:13:01.000] and so like panicked by everything
[00:13:01.000] 所以，我对一切都感到恐慌。
[00:13:03.000] that even the small tasks I'm like unable to touch them
[00:13:03.000] 就连一些小事，我都无法触及。
[00:13:08.000] because I think the logic is like oh there's this way more urgent thing that I should do
[00:13:08.000] 因为我觉得他们的逻辑是：哦，还有一件更紧急的事情我应该去做。
[00:13:14.000] so the small task I am going to push it aside
[00:13:14.000] 所以我打算先把这项小任务搁置一边。
[00:13:17.000] but then it leads to like nothing being done basically
[00:13:17.000] 但结果就是基本上什么都没做。
[00:13:20.000] and I think it's getting to the point where
[00:13:20.000] 我觉得事情已经发展到这种地步了。
[00:13:23.000] even things that like bring me joy
[00:13:23.000] 甚至像那些能给我带来快乐的事物
[00:13:26.000] or normally would slash should
[00:13:26.000] 或者通常会斜杠“应该”。
[00:13:28.000] are starting to feel like obligations to me
[00:13:28.000] 开始感觉像是对我的义务了。
[00:13:31.000] because I just don't have like mental space
[00:13:31.000] 因为我根本没有精力去想这些。
[00:13:33.000] damn
[00:13:33.000] 该死
[00:13:34.000] so like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed about everything
[00:13:34.000] 所以你感觉自己对所有事情都感到不知所措。
[00:13:37.000] yeah exactly
[00:13:37.000] 对，没错。
[00:13:38.000] and I think this ties me in to like
[00:13:38.000] 我觉得这让我联想到……
[00:13:42.000] something that you were talking about
[00:13:42.000] 你刚才说的那件事
[00:13:44.000] of like how do I know what I really want to do
[00:13:44.000] 比如，我怎么知道自己真正想做什么呢？
[00:13:48.000] or like how do I know how I'm feeling
[00:13:48.000] 或者，我怎么知道自己的感受呢？
[00:13:50.000] like how do I check in with myself constantly
[00:13:50.000] 我该如何不断地审视自己呢？
[00:13:53.000] I think I just don't have that check-in time
[00:13:53.000] 我觉得我只是没有那个办理入住的时间。
[00:13:56.000] or that check-in capacity right now
[00:13:56.000] 或者说，目前的办理入住手续能力。
[00:13:59.000] and it's making me think of everything as like an obligation
[00:13:59.000] 这让我觉得一切都像是某种义务。
[00:14:04.000] when in reality I feel like life is not like that
[00:14:04.000] 但实际上我觉得生活并非如此。
[00:14:06.000] it's like some things are obligations
[00:14:06.000] 有些事就像是义务一样。
[00:14:08.000] other things are fun things
[00:14:08.000] 其他事情都很有趣
[00:14:09.000] other things are like building blocks
[00:14:09.000] 其他事物就像积木一样。
[00:14:11.000] to drive momentum for another goal etc etc
[00:14:11.000] 为了推动另一个目标的实现等等
[00:14:14.000] but right now I think everything just feels like an obligation
[00:14:14.000] 但现在我觉得一切都像是义务。
[00:14:18.000] and I'm like I don't know how to snap out of this
[00:14:18.000] 我当时就想，我不知道该怎么摆脱这种状态。
[00:14:21.000] like I don't know how to not feel guilty all the time
[00:14:21.000] 我不知道该如何才能不一直感到内疚。
[00:14:23.000] I just don't know
[00:14:23.000] 我真的不知道
[00:14:25.000] dude maybe you need a true vacation
[00:14:25.000] 兄弟，或许你需要好好休个假。
[00:14:28.000] okay this is a fantasy of mine
[00:14:28.000] 好吧，这是我的一个幻想。
[00:14:30.000] which is just like to take a week off
[00:14:30.000] 这就好比休假一周一样
[00:14:33.000] you know burn through a bunch of PTO
[00:14:33.000] 你知道，要花掉一大堆带薪休假时间。
[00:14:35.000] but literally do nothing
[00:14:35.000] 但实际上什么也不做
[00:14:37.000] like not travel or anything
[00:14:37.000] 比如不旅行之类的
[00:14:39.000] but like literally just relax for a few days
[00:14:39.000] 但真的就放松几天吧。
[00:14:42.000] whether that mean at home
[00:14:42.000] 无论这意味着在家
[00:14:44.000] well it probably means at home
[00:14:44.000] 嗯，这可能指的是在家。
[00:14:46.000] like you know sleep in
[00:14:46.000] 就像你知道的，睡觉
[00:14:48.000] have no responsibility
[00:14:48.000] 不承担任何责任
[00:14:50.000] for longer than a weekend
[00:14:50.000] 超过一个周末
[00:14:52.000] dude yeah I feel like that's the dream
[00:14:52.000] 兄弟，是啊，我觉得那就是梦想成真了。
[00:14:54.000] and even that is like a good way to describe how I'm feeling
[00:14:54.000] 甚至用“用这个词来形容我现在的感受”都算不错了。
[00:14:58.000] it's like I feel like I have to maximize my PTO always
[00:14:58.000] 我感觉自己好像必须一直把休假时间用到最大。
[00:15:02.000] like I have to maximize this
[00:15:02.000] 就像我必须最大限度地利用这一点一样
[00:15:04.000] if I have a free weekend I have to get all these things done
[00:15:04.000] 如果我周末有空，我必须完成所有这些事情。
[00:15:07.000] and I think a lot of it is sort of like perfectionism in a sense
[00:15:07.000] 我觉得这在某种程度上有点像完美主义。
[00:15:11.000] which is so ironic because
[00:15:11.000] 这真是莫大的讽刺，因为
[00:15:14.000] I'm not a perfectionist like when it comes down to it
[00:15:14.000] 说到底，我不是个完美主义者。
[00:15:17.000] so I don't know why in terms of like schedule management
[00:15:17.000] 所以我不知道为什么在日程安排方面会受到影响
[00:15:20.000] I just always have to like fill it up with shit
[00:15:20.000] 我总是得往里面塞满屎。
[00:15:24.000] but I'm just overwhelmed and I'm like freaking out
[00:15:24.000] 但我真的不知所措，快要崩溃了。
[00:15:27.000] and I you know because I've been so busy
[00:15:27.000] 你知道，因为我一直都很忙。
[00:15:30.000] or at least feeling like I'm so busy
[00:15:30.000] 或者至少感觉自己非常忙碌。
[00:15:33.000] I've also been unable to talk to my therapist
[00:15:33.000] 我也一直没能和我的治疗师交谈。
[00:15:36.000] so then what's been happening is
[00:15:36.000] 所以，目前发生的事情是……
[00:15:39.000] instead of working out my problems like a normal person
[00:15:39.000] 而不是像正常人一样解决问题
[00:15:42.000] I just have fucking nightmares about all the things that are going on
[00:15:42.000] 我整天做噩梦，梦到现在发生的这一切。
[00:15:45.000] dude
[00:15:45.000] 兄弟
[00:15:47.000] that's the worst the stress dreams
[00:15:47.000] 最糟糕的就是压力梦了。
[00:15:50.000] I know it's so bad
[00:15:50.000] 我知道这很糟糕。
[00:15:52.000] I feel like the way our society is run
[00:15:52.000] 我觉得我们社会的运作方式……
[00:15:56.000] slash like the way it functions right now
[00:15:56.000] 斜杠现在这样运作就很好。
[00:15:59.000] totally can lead to this feeling as well
[00:15:59.000] 完全也可能导致这种感觉。
[00:16:02.000] because I often think about it how we literally work
[00:16:02.000] 因为我经常思考我们实际是如何工作的。
[00:16:06.000] you know five days a week nine to five
[00:16:06.000] 你知道，一周五天，朝九晚五。
[00:16:09.000] and after work we're pretty tired you know we've been using our brain
[00:16:09.000] 下班后我们都很累，你知道，我们一直在用脑子。
[00:16:12.000] we've been you know talking to our coworkers
[00:16:12.000] 我们一直在和同事们交流。
[00:16:15.000] all that stuff so you're pretty tired after work
[00:16:15.000] 都是这些事儿，所以你下班后会很累。
[00:16:18.000] and now that we go into the office a few days
[00:16:18.000] 现在我们去办公室上班几天了。
[00:16:21.000] sometimes that nine to five gets a little extended
[00:16:21.000] 有时候朝九晚五的工作时间会稍微延长一些。
[00:16:24.000] because we have to sit through traffic
[00:16:24.000] 因为我们不得不堵车。
[00:16:26.000] and then you only have so many hours left in the day
[00:16:26.000] 一天剩下的时间就那么多。
[00:16:29.000] but you're not fully yourself anymore
[00:16:29.000] 但你已经不再是完整的自己了。
[00:16:32.000] we kind of just succumb to the easy stuff
[00:16:32.000] 我们很容易就屈服于那些容易的事。
[00:16:35.000] you know watching some easy to watch TV
[00:16:35.000] 你知道，看一些轻松的电视节目
[00:16:38.000] or you know playing some mindless games
[00:16:38.000] 或者玩一些无脑游戏
[00:16:40.000] or something of that sort
[00:16:40.000] 或者类似的事情
[00:16:42.000] then we wake up and do it again
[00:16:42.000] 然后我们醒来，再次重复这个过程。
[00:16:44.000] and then we have the weekends where that's where we like shove all our social responsibilities
[00:16:44.000] 然后就是周末，我们好像把所有的社交责任都塞到周末去了。
[00:16:49.000] hang out with friends
[00:16:49.000] 和朋友们一起玩
[00:16:51.000] and it's like sometimes hard to have a minute to like catch your breath
[00:16:51.000] 有时候，连喘口气的片刻都很难抽出。
[00:16:55.000] so I totally know what you mean
[00:16:55.000] 所以我完全明白你的意思。
[00:16:57.000] and then I can totally see how this would build up over time
[00:16:57.000] 然后我完全可以想象这会如何随着时间的推移而逐渐形成。
[00:17:00.000] so then eventually you just feel like exactly how you described
[00:17:00.000] 所以最终你会感觉就像你描述的那样。
[00:17:04.000] you're always just like chasing something
[00:17:04.000] 你总是像在追逐什么东西。
[00:17:06.000] or being chased
[00:17:06.000] 或者被追赶
[00:17:08.000] but you're like when can I catch my breath
[00:17:08.000] 但你却问自己：我什么时候才能喘口气？
[00:17:10.000] yeah I think that's like totally a big part of it
[00:17:10.000] 是的，我觉得这绝对是其中一个重要因素。
[00:17:14.000] I think also like some of it probably does live with myself as well
[00:17:14.000] 我觉得其中一些可能也确实存在于我自己的生活中。
[00:17:18.000] I take responsibility for not knowing how to prioritize
[00:17:18.000] 我承认自己不知道如何分清轻重缓急。
[00:17:21.000] I think that's the big thing
[00:17:21.000] 我认为这才是关键所在。
[00:17:23.000] it's like I want to do everything
[00:17:23.000] 我好像什么都想做。
[00:17:25.000] but in reality you only have so many hours in the day
[00:17:25.000] 但实际上，一天只有24小时。
[00:17:27.000] so you just like pick and choose certain things
[00:17:27.000] 所以你就可以随意挑选一些东西。
[00:17:30.000] and then stuff that's not as important or as key
[00:17:30.000] 然后是一些不太重要或不太关键的事情。
[00:17:33.000] you push that off or you prioritize it later on a different day
[00:17:33.000] 你可以把那件事推迟到以后再做，或者安排在另一天优先处理。
[00:17:37.000] but I think for me it's really hard to do that
[00:17:37.000] 但我认为对我来说，这真的很难做到。
[00:17:40.000] so then I just end up doing everything poorly
[00:17:40.000] 结果就是我什么都做得不好。
[00:17:43.000] and I was talking to James about this
[00:17:43.000] 我当时正和詹姆斯谈论这件事。
[00:17:46.000] because I think he is very good at prioritizing
[00:17:46.000] 因为我认为他非常擅长分清轻重缓急。
[00:17:50.000] he doesn't feel a ton of guilt when he has to de-prioritize things
[00:17:50.000] 当他不得不降低某些事情的优先级时，他并不会感到太多的内疚。
[00:17:55.000] versus for me I feel heavy guilt
[00:17:55.000] 而我却感到深深的内疚。
[00:17:57.000] because I've been unable to see my therapist
[00:17:57.000] 因为我一直没能见到我的心理治疗师。
[00:17:59.000] he's like my pseudo therapist right now unfortunately
[00:17:59.000] 不幸的是，他现在就像我的临时心理咨询师一样。
[00:18:02.000] and he basically was like why would you even want to show up
[00:18:02.000] 他基本上就是问，你为什么要来？
[00:18:06.000] to certain things or try to tackle certain things
[00:18:06.000] 去做某些事或尝试解决某些问题
[00:18:09.000] when you're not feeling like 100% capacity
[00:18:09.000] 当你感觉状态并非百分之百时
[00:18:12.000] because that's just gonna make that hangout not fun for your friend
[00:18:12.000] 因为那样只会让你的朋友觉得这次聚会不好玩。
[00:18:16.000] or you're gonna end up putting half effort into whatever tasks
[00:18:16.000] 否则你最终只会敷衍了事，无法完成任何任务。
[00:18:19.000] that you're doing and that task might be important too right
[00:18:19.000] 你正在做的这件事，而且那项任务可能也很重要，对吧？
[00:18:22.000] he was like you just need to like rest more
[00:18:22.000] 他当时说，你只需要多休息。
[00:18:24.000] and then like pick like one or two things
[00:18:24.000] 然后选一两样东西。
[00:18:26.000] and then just like do that
[00:18:26.000] 然后就那样做。
[00:18:28.000] otherwise what's gonna happen is what I mentioned earlier
[00:18:28.000] 否则就会发生我之前提到的那些事。
[00:18:31.000] you're gonna do everything poorly
[00:18:31.000] 你做什么都会做得很糟糕
[00:18:33.000] and I was kind of thinking about it
[00:18:33.000] 我当时正在考虑这件事。
[00:18:35.000] and I was like fucking facts
[00:18:35.000] 我当时就想，这他妈说得太对了。
[00:18:37.000] because recently I went to hang out with a really close friend
[00:18:37.000] 因为最近我和一位非常要好的朋友出去玩了。
[00:18:41.000] and I felt like the entire time we were hanging out
[00:18:41.000] 我觉得我们一起玩的整个过程中
[00:18:43.000] instead of catching up about life
[00:18:43.000] 而不是聊聊生活琐事
[00:18:45.000] I spent like I don't know maybe like 10 minutes
[00:18:45.000] 我花了大概……我也不知道，大概10分钟吧。
[00:18:47.000] like bitching about how I felt so busy
[00:18:47.000] 比如抱怨我感觉自己太忙了
[00:18:50.000] and felt so overwhelmed and blah blah blah
[00:18:50.000] 感觉压力好大，等等等等
[00:18:52.000] and it did feel somewhat good to get it off my chest
[00:18:52.000] 说出来确实感觉好多了。
[00:18:56.000] but on the other hand I was like
[00:18:56.000] 但另一方面，我又想：
[00:18:58.000] that's such a waste of time
[00:18:58.000] 真是浪费时间
[00:19:00.000] like I don't want to negatively affect other people
[00:19:00.000] 我不想对他人造成负面影响。
[00:19:04.000] with how I'm feeling overwhelmed
[00:19:04.000] 我感觉自己快要崩溃了。
[00:19:06.000] I would much rather if I were to go do that hangout again
[00:19:06.000] 我更希望再次参加那个聚会。
[00:19:09.000] which I guess is not that big of a deal
[00:19:09.000] 我想这应该不算什么大事。
[00:19:11.000] because I see this person somewhat often
[00:19:11.000] 因为我经常见到这个人。
[00:19:13.000] but you know I would rather spend that 10 minutes
[00:19:13.000] 但你知道，我宁愿花那十分钟。
[00:19:16.000] like talking about something else
[00:19:16.000] 比如谈论其他事情
[00:19:17.000] or catching up about her life
[00:19:17.000] 或者聊聊她的生活。
[00:19:19.000] or you know things like that
[00:19:19.000] 或者你知道诸如此类的事情
[00:19:20.000] so then I guess I just felt like
[00:19:20.000] 所以，我想我当时就觉得
[00:19:23.000] if I don't get this prioritizing thing straight soon
[00:19:23.000] 如果我不能尽快理清这个优先级问题
[00:19:28.000] I'm just gonna be like a Debbie Downer
[00:19:28.000] 我简直就是个扫兴鬼。
[00:19:30.000] or like a negative Nancy at like everything I do
[00:19:30.000] 或者像个消极的南希，对我做的每件事都横加指责。
[00:19:32.000] in the next couple of months
[00:19:32.000] 接下来的几个月
[00:19:34.000] oh no
[00:19:34.000] 哦，不
[00:19:35.000] it's okay I'm sure your friend appreciated
[00:19:35.000] 没关系，我相信你的朋友会很感激的。
[00:19:38.000] hearing about your life update
[00:19:38.000] 听到你的生活近况
[00:19:40.000] even though it was a little negative
[00:19:40.000] 虽然有点负面。
[00:19:43.000] it was literally like over a lot of times
[00:19:43.000] 真的就像结束了很多次一样
[00:19:45.000] I was like I just fucking care about it
[00:19:45.000] 我当时就想，我他妈的就是很在乎这件事。
[00:19:47.000] I wasn't crying but internally I was
[00:19:47.000] 我当时没有哭，但内心却在哭。
[00:19:51.000] and you know I think it's reasonable too
[00:19:51.000] 而且我觉得这也很合理。
[00:19:53.000] because like sometimes
[00:19:53.000] 因为有时候
[00:19:55.000] someone else is going through a tougher time
[00:19:55.000] 其他人正经历着更艰难的时期
[00:19:57.000] sometimes you're going through a tougher time
[00:19:57.000] 有时你会经历一段更艰难的时期
[00:19:59.000] so it's okay to slip up here and there
[00:19:59.000] 所以偶尔犯点小错也没关系。
[00:20:03.000] although I wouldn't even call it slip up
[00:20:03.000] 虽然我甚至不会称之为失误。
[00:20:05.000] I would just call it like you know this time
[00:20:05.000] 这次我就直接这么说吧，你知道的。
[00:20:07.000] you're sharing your negative thoughts
[00:20:07.000] 你正在分享你的负面想法
[00:20:09.000] next time maybe they'll share
[00:20:09.000] 下次他们或许会分享
[00:20:11.000] and maybe the next time after that
[00:20:11.000] 也许下一次就是这样
[00:20:13.000] you both share like happy thoughts
[00:20:13.000] 你们俩都分享着快乐的想法
[00:20:15.000] that's true
[00:20:15.000] 这是真的
[00:20:16.000] but I do get what you mean
[00:20:16.000] 但我明白你的意思。
[00:20:18.000] like you don't want your mind to be so consumed
[00:20:18.000] 就像你不希望自己的思绪被完全占据一样。
[00:20:21.000] by the negative thoughts
[00:20:21.000] 负面情绪
[00:20:22.000] and then like kind of loom over
[00:20:22.000] 然后就像某种阴影笼罩着我。
[00:20:24.000] like if there was a way to share the negative thoughts
[00:20:24.000] 比如，如果有一种方法可以分享负面想法就好了
[00:20:26.000] but happily right
[00:20:26.000] 但令人欣慰的是，我猜对了。
[00:20:29.000] I just wish I could put the part of my brain
[00:20:29.000] 我真希望我能把我的大脑那部分放进去
[00:20:32.000] that's like consumed by feeling so busy
[00:20:32.000] 感觉就像被忙碌的感觉吞噬了一样。
[00:20:35.000] and being freaked out by being busy
[00:20:35.000] 忙碌让我感到恐慌
[00:20:37.000] and just like make that part of my brain
[00:20:37.000] 就像把我大脑的那部分也变成那样
[00:20:39.000] actually do shit
[00:20:39.000] 真的干了些事
[00:20:40.000] because then I'll be less busy
[00:20:40.000] 因为那样我就不会那么忙了。
[00:20:42.000] theoretically
[00:20:42.000] 理论上
[00:20:44.000] I mean but if you're overwhelmed
[00:20:44.000] 我的意思是，但如果你感到不知所措……
[00:20:46.000] it's hard to do anything
[00:20:46.000] 做任何事都很困难。
[00:20:47.000] yeah that's true
[00:20:47.000] 是的，没错。
[00:20:48.000] the trap
[00:20:48.000] 陷阱
[00:20:50.000] you know I think it's really funny too though
[00:20:50.000] 你知道吗，我也觉得这真的很有趣。
[00:20:52.000] we both shared how we're having like
[00:20:52.000] 我们俩都分享了我们各自的感受。
[00:20:54.000] pretty big I guess life evaluation
[00:20:54.000] 我想这算是相当重要的人生评价了
[00:20:57.000] worthy moments
[00:20:57.000] 值得纪念的时刻
[00:20:59.000] and also what's funny is we've been chatting
[00:20:59.000] 还有一件有趣的事是，我们一直在聊天。
[00:21:02.000] and I recently told you I was like
[00:21:02.000] 我最近跟你说过，我当时就像
[00:21:04.000] oh my god I'm like addicted to the Sims right now
[00:21:04.000] 我的天哪，我现在简直对模拟人生上瘾了
[00:21:06.000] the game
[00:21:06.000] 游戏
[00:21:07.000] and then you were like yeah
[00:21:07.000] 然后你就说，嗯。
[00:21:09.000] I'm like so addicted to TFT right now too
[00:21:09.000] 我现在也超级迷TFT。
[00:21:11.000] and I'm just like
[00:21:11.000] 我当时就想：
[00:21:13.000] this is our issue is manifesting
[00:21:13.000] 这就是我们问题的表现形式。
[00:21:15.000] in a distraction
[00:21:15.000] 心不在焉
[00:21:17.000] dude I was just thinking about that actually
[00:21:17.000] 兄弟，我刚才也正想着这事儿呢。
[00:21:19.000] because I feel like
[00:21:19.000] 因为我感觉
[00:21:21.000] whenever there's all these things going wrong in life
[00:21:21.000] 每当生活中发生这么多不顺的事情时
[00:21:23.000] I can only put my energy into one
[00:21:23.000] 我只能将精力投入到一件事上。
[00:21:25.000] or two things
[00:21:25.000] 或者两件事
[00:21:26.000] and the thing that is going well in life
[00:21:26.000] 生活中一切顺利的事情
[00:21:28.000] is my fucking TFT addiction
[00:21:28.000] 我他妈的沉迷于TFT了。
[00:21:31.000] which is so bad
[00:21:31.000] 这太糟糕了
[00:21:32.000] the world is crashing and burning
[00:21:32.000] 世界正在崩溃燃烧
[00:21:34.000] but like your TFT
[00:21:34.000] 但就像你的TFT一样。
[00:21:36.000] first every time
[00:21:36.000] 每次都是第一次
[00:21:39.000] I'm climbing the ring
[00:21:39.000] 我正在攀爬圆环
[00:21:41.000] and I've been keeping up with my gym
[00:21:41.000] 我一直坚持去健身房锻炼。
[00:21:43.000] like my like workout schedule
[00:21:43.000] 就像我的健身计划一样
[00:21:45.000] which is good that's good
[00:21:45.000] 那很好，这很好
[00:21:46.000] that means everything else in my life
[00:21:46.000] 这意味着我生活中其他的一切
[00:21:47.000] is fucking going poorly so
[00:21:47.000] 情况糟透了
[00:21:50.000] yeah every time I play the Sims now
[00:21:50.000] 是的，我现在每次玩模拟人生的时候都会这样。
[00:21:52.000] I'm like oh my god
[00:21:52.000] 我当时就想，我的天哪
[00:21:53.000] if only life was as easy as the Sims
[00:21:53.000] 如果生活真像模拟人生那么简单就好了
[00:21:55.000] like dude just open up the cheats tab
[00:21:55.000] 哥们，直接打开作弊标签页就行了。
[00:21:57.000] and type in motherload
[00:21:57.000] 并输入母体
[00:21:59.000] that's like a free 50k right there
[00:21:59.000] 那相当于白送5万块钱。
[00:22:01.000] oh my god
[00:22:01.000] 我的天啊
[00:22:03.000] and then like going to school
[00:22:03.000] 然后就像去上学一样
[00:22:04.000] and stuff in Sims
[00:22:04.000] 还有模拟人生里的东西
[00:22:05.000] all you have to do is like
[00:22:05.000] 你只需要点赞
[00:22:06.000] do homework for an hour
[00:22:06.000] 做一小时作业
[00:22:07.000] dude you're good
[00:22:07.000] 兄弟，你真棒
[00:22:10.000] why isn't life so easy
[00:22:10.000] 为什么生活总是这么难？
[00:22:12.000] like truly
[00:22:12.000] 真的
[00:22:13.000] yeah I sometimes wish
[00:22:13.000] 是啊，我有时也希望
[00:22:15.000] life was as easy as controlling a sim
[00:22:15.000] 生活就像操控一个模拟人生游戏一样简单。
[00:22:18.000] so this heavy shit aside
[00:22:18.000] 所以，先不说这些沉重的话题。
[00:22:20.000] I did have some like random realizations recently
[00:22:20.000] 我最近确实有一些零星的领悟。
[00:22:22.000] that I do feel like
[00:22:22.000] 我确实有这种感觉
[00:22:24.000] is making me feel more in tune with myself
[00:22:24.000] 这让我感觉更了解自己了。
[00:22:27.000] and just more connected with myself
[00:22:27.000] 也更能与自己建立联系。
[00:22:29.000] and I don't know why
[00:22:29.000] 我不知道为什么
[00:22:31.000] it took me like five years of working
[00:22:31.000] 我花了大约五年时间才完成。
[00:22:33.000] to come to this realization
[00:22:33.000] 最终意识到这一点
[00:22:35.000] but I just realized
[00:22:35.000] 但我刚刚意识到
[00:22:37.000] that in meetings with people
[00:22:37.000] 在与人们的会议中
[00:22:39.000] like camera on meetings
[00:22:39.000] 就像会议上的摄像头一样
[00:22:41.000] you don't always have to be smiling
[00:22:41.000] 你不必总是面带微笑。
[00:22:43.000] oh my god
[00:22:43.000] 我的天啊
[00:22:45.000] maybe it's because
[00:22:45.000] 或许是因为
[00:22:47.000] usually in meetings I was always
[00:22:47.000] 通常在会议上我总是
[00:22:49.000] like on the younger end
[00:22:49.000] 就像年轻一代那样
[00:22:51.000] or maybe it's just my burning desire
[00:22:51.000] 或许这只是我强烈的渴望
[00:22:53.000] slash obligation
[00:22:53.000] 削减义务
[00:22:55.000] as like a young Asian woman
[00:22:55.000] 就像一位年轻的亚洲女性
[00:22:57.000] to be like super happy and bubbly
[00:22:57.000] 变得超级开心活泼
[00:22:59.000] and like oh yeah of course I don't mind
[00:22:59.000] 哦，当然，我不介意
[00:23:01.000] I will take on that obligation
[00:23:01.000] 我将承担这项义务
[00:23:03.000] but now that I'm in my late 20s
[00:23:03.000] 但现在我已经快30岁了
[00:23:05.000] I'm like what the fuck
[00:23:05.000] 我当时就想：这他妈什么鬼？
[00:23:07.000] like execs don't always smile during meetings
[00:23:07.000] 就像高管们在会议上并非总是面带微笑一样
[00:23:09.000] like why am I
[00:23:09.000] 我为什么会这样？
[00:23:11.000] as a junior level employee who is
[00:23:11.000] 作为一名初级员工，
[00:23:13.000] getting all these obligations handed to me
[00:23:13.000] 所有这些义务都落到了我头上。
[00:23:15.000] like why do I always have to be the one smiling
[00:23:15.000] 为什么总是我一个人在笑？
[00:23:17.000] and taking all these things with a smile
[00:23:17.000] 并面带微笑地接受这一切。
[00:23:19.000] because at the end of the day
[00:23:19.000] 因为归根结底
[00:23:21.000] I may like 80% of the time
[00:23:21.000] 我可能80%的时间都喜欢
[00:23:23.000] like have to take these things
[00:23:23.000] 比如必须服用这些东西
[00:23:25.000] but that doesn't mean I have to always be like
[00:23:25.000] 但这并不意味着我必须总是那样
[00:23:27.000] grinning ear to ear
[00:23:27.000] 咧嘴大笑
[00:23:29.000] which doesn't feel authentic
[00:23:29.000] 这感觉不太真实
[00:23:31.000] and it just makes me hate myself
[00:23:31.000] 这让我更加憎恨自己。
[00:23:33.000] like after the call is over
[00:23:33.000] 比如通话结束后
[00:23:35.000] so recently in a meeting
[00:23:35.000] 最近在一次会议上
[00:23:37.000] I was just talking to someone
[00:23:37.000] 我刚才在和人聊天
[00:23:39.000] and they were like oh like do you mind doing this
[00:23:39.000] 他们就问，哦，你介意这样做吗？
[00:23:41.000] I didn't smile
[00:23:41.000] 我没有笑。
[00:23:43.000] I was just like yeah sure I can do that
[00:23:43.000] 我当时就想，是啊，当然可以。
[00:23:45.000] and with a straight face
[00:23:45.000] 一本正经地
[00:23:47.000] and it low key like changed my life
[00:23:47.000] 它悄悄地改变了我的生活
[00:23:49.000] did it make the other person go like
[00:23:49.000] 这是否让对方感觉像
[00:23:51.000] oh actually never mind I'll do it
[00:23:51.000] 哦，其实没事了，我会做的。
[00:23:53.000] no so they were just like
[00:23:53.000] 不，他们就像
[00:23:55.000] oh are you sure you're like okay doing it
[00:23:55.000] 哦，你确定你觉得这样做没问题吗？
[00:23:57.000] oh
[00:23:57.000] 哦
[00:23:59.000] and then I was like
[00:23:59.000] 然后我就想：
[00:24:01.000] yeah I can do it
[00:24:01.000] 是的，我可以做到。
[00:24:03.000] I didn't want to come off like I was giving them attitude
[00:24:03.000] 我不想显得我对他们态度不好。
[00:24:05.000] or like sass
[00:24:05.000] 或者像 Sass 那样
[00:24:07.000] but that doesn't mean I have to be like
[00:24:07.000] 但这并不意味着我必须像……
[00:24:09.000] I'm on this task you know
[00:24:09.000] 你知道，我正在执行这项任务。
[00:24:11.000] so then I was like in some way
[00:24:11.000] 所以当时我就想，某种程度上
[00:24:13.000] I am expressing myself
[00:24:13.000] 我正在表达自己
[00:24:15.000] and the thing is
[00:24:15.000] 问题是……
[00:24:17.000] at the end of the day there's a ton of people who don't smile
[00:24:17.000] 说到底，还是有很多人不爱笑的。
[00:24:19.000] all the time during meetings
[00:24:19.000] 会议期间一直如此
[00:24:21.000] actually that's probably like the majority of your co-curs
[00:24:21.000] 实际上，这可能和你们大多数的共同课程的情况差不多。
[00:24:23.000] so I was like I'm just being normal now
[00:24:23.000] 所以我就想，我现在就做个正常人吧
[00:24:25.000] yeah and shedding like my mask
[00:24:25.000] 是啊，就像我的面具一样脱落了。
[00:24:27.000] ooh
[00:24:27.000] 哦
[00:24:29.000] so it felt very freeing to be like
[00:24:29.000] 所以感觉很自由，就像
[00:24:31.000] sure I'll do it I guess
[00:24:31.000] 我想我肯定会做的。
[00:24:33.000] with an eye roll
[00:24:33.000] 翻了个白眼
[00:24:35.000] no just kidding
[00:24:35.000] 开玩笑啦
[00:24:37.000] it was cathartic and I was like
[00:24:37.000] 这让我感觉很畅快，我当时就像……
[00:24:39.000] is this how other people
[00:24:39.000] 其他人也是这样吗？
[00:24:41.000] what other people are like during meetings
[00:24:41.000] 会议期间其他人的表现如何
[00:24:43.000] they don't always pretend like they're like giga happy all the time
[00:24:43.000] 他们并不总是假装自己一直都非常开心
[00:24:45.000] like I was like this
[00:24:45.000] 我当时就像这样
[00:24:47.000] can be me I'm not
[00:24:47.000] 可能是我，我不是。
[00:24:49.000] masking my emotions dude I can't wait
[00:24:49.000] 老兄，我得掩饰自己的情绪，我等不及了。
[00:24:51.000] till you show annoyance in meetings
[00:24:51.000] 直到你在会议上表现出恼怒为止
[00:24:53.000] you can be like
[00:24:53.000] 你可以像
[00:24:55.000] um yeah I guess
[00:24:55.000] 嗯，是的，我想是的
[00:24:57.000] I could do this but let's rethink this
[00:24:57.000] 我可以这么做，但我们再重新考虑一下。
[00:24:59.000] like is this something we actually need
[00:24:59.000] 这真的是我们需要的吗？
[00:25:01.000] then everyone will be like oh
[00:25:01.000] 然后大家都会说“哦”。
[00:25:03.000] shes right do we actually
[00:25:03.000] 她说的对，我们真的……吗？
[00:25:05.000] need to make her do this
[00:25:05.000] 需要让她这样做
[00:25:07.000] I think I've done that before
[00:25:07.000] 我想我以前做过这件事。
[00:25:09.000] but it hasn't been very controlled
[00:25:09.000] 但它一直没有得到很好的控制。
[00:25:11.000] like I feel like if I'm pushed to that point
[00:25:11.000] 我觉得如果我被逼到那个地步……
[00:25:13.000] I'm like really pushed there
[00:25:13.000] 我感觉自己真的被逼到了那个地步。
[00:25:15.000] but I feel like you can do that without being emotional
[00:25:15.000] 但我感觉你可以不带情绪地做到这一点。
[00:25:17.000] you know so I'm like definitely working up
[00:25:17.000] 你知道，所以我肯定在努力向上
[00:25:19.000] to that and again
[00:25:19.000] 对此，再次
[00:25:21.000] I feel like this is a huge realization
[00:25:21.000] 我觉得这是一个巨大的领悟。
[00:25:23.000] for me but for many people
[00:25:23.000] 对我来说是这样，但对很多人来说也是如此
[00:25:25.000] this is just how they've approached work their whole life
[00:25:25.000] 他们一生都是这样对待工作的。
[00:25:27.000] no I think I'm
[00:25:27.000] 不，我想我是
[00:25:29.000] similar I always try to like smile
[00:25:29.000] 类似地，我总是尽量喜欢微笑。
[00:25:31.000] and not that's like the mantra
[00:25:31.000] 而不是像咒语那样
[00:25:33.000] going through my head during meetings
[00:25:33.000] 开会时我脑子里一直在想这些事
[00:25:35.000] smile and nod you know
[00:25:35.000] 微笑点头，你懂的。
[00:25:37.000] say something positive if you can
[00:25:37.000] 如果可以的话，说些积极的话。
[00:25:39.000] like insert yourself in here or whatever
[00:25:39.000] 比如把自己代入进去之类的
[00:25:41.000] you're right I think part of it is
[00:25:41.000] 你说得对，我觉得部分原因是……
[00:25:43.000] drilled in from when we were younger
[00:25:43.000] 从小就被灌输这种观念
[00:25:45.000] like new to the workforce
[00:25:45.000] 像新入职的员工一样
[00:25:47.000] and we're like oh we need to show everyone
[00:25:47.000] 然后我们就想，哦，我们需要让所有人看看。
[00:25:49.000] we're happy to be here and like excited to do work
[00:25:49.000] 我们很高兴来到这里，也很兴奋能开始工作。
[00:25:51.000] but now it's like okay
[00:25:51.000] 但现在感觉就像是，好吧
[00:25:53.000] actually everyone else is just as jaded
[00:25:53.000] 事实上，其他人也都一样厌倦了。
[00:25:55.000] as we are if not more
[00:25:55.000] 我们即便不是更甚，也依然如此。
[00:25:57.000] because a lot of my coworkers are older than me
[00:25:57.000] 因为我的很多同事都比我年长。
[00:25:59.000] so like
[00:25:59.000] 所以就像
[00:26:01.000] very normal to them probably
[00:26:01.000] 对他们来说这很正常，可能
[00:26:03.000] yeah exactly
[00:26:03.000] 对，没错。
[00:26:05.000] and I feel like there's been
[00:26:05.000] 我觉得一直以来都是这样。
[00:26:07.000] a ton of meetings where
[00:26:07.000] 大量的会议，
[00:26:09.000] I'm like talking to someone and I'm like
[00:26:09.000] 我就像在跟人说话，然后我就……
[00:26:11.000] super happy
[00:26:11.000] 超级开心
[00:26:13.000] presenting on the outside
[00:26:13.000] 对外展示
[00:26:15.000] and the other person doesn't match my energy
[00:26:15.000] 对方的能量跟不上我的。
[00:26:17.000] and I feel like in the past I was kind of like
[00:26:17.000] 我觉得过去我有点像……
[00:26:19.000] what the hell
[00:26:19.000] 我勒个去
[00:26:21.000] I'm being so polite and this person is not
[00:26:21.000] 我已经很客气了，但这个人却不是这样。
[00:26:23.000] but then I was kind of like well this person isn't forcing me
[00:26:23.000] 但后来我就想，这个人并没有强迫我。
[00:26:25.000] to be super polite
[00:26:25.000] 非常礼貌
[00:26:27.000] and like super happy and like smiley smiley
[00:26:27.000] 超级开心，笑得合不拢嘴
[00:26:29.000] it's just like what I feel like I should be doing in meetings
[00:26:29.000] 这正是我觉得我应该在会议上做的事情。
[00:26:31.000] honestly it's not a sin to like
[00:26:31.000] 说实话，喜欢并不是罪过。
[00:26:33.000] match someone else's energy as long as
[00:26:33.000] 只要能与他人的能量相匹配，
[00:26:35.000] I'm not being rude or impolite
[00:26:35.000] 我并没有无礼或不礼貌的意思。
[00:26:37.000] so maybe in some ways
[00:26:37.000] 所以也许在某些方面
[00:26:39.000] it's almost like a power move to not
[00:26:39.000] 这几乎就像是一种权力游戏，故意不这么做。
[00:26:41.000] smile during meetings
[00:26:41.000] 会议期间保持微笑
[00:26:43.000] or at least not feel obligated to smile
[00:26:43.000] 或者至少不会觉得有义务微笑。
[00:26:45.000] yeah like keep them guessing
[00:26:45.000] 对，就让他们猜不透。
[00:26:47.000] I don't know what your emotion is
[00:26:47.000] 我不知道你是什么情绪。
[00:26:49.000] yeah true
[00:26:49.000] 是的，没错。
[00:26:51.000] dude but this kind of ties in
[00:26:51.000] 兄弟，但这跟……有点关系。
[00:26:53.000] with what I was saying earlier
[00:26:53.000] 我刚才说的
[00:26:55.000] when you said no one's forcing
[00:26:55.000] 你说过没人强迫你。
[00:26:57.000] you to be all smiley smiley
[00:26:57.000] 你得一直笑眯眯的
[00:26:59.000] it's like how I said like
[00:26:59.000] 就像我说的那样，就像
[00:27:01.000] we have to be doing things that we want to do
[00:27:01.000] 我们必须做我们想做的事情。
[00:27:03.000] so
[00:27:03.000] 所以
[00:27:05.000] you should be smiley smiley if you want to
[00:27:05.000] 如果你想的话，你应该笑眯眯的。
[00:27:07.000] but like if you don't want to fuck it right
[00:27:07.000] 但如果你不想直接上床的话
[00:27:09.000] yeah
[00:27:09.000] 是的
[00:27:11.000] and I was actually talking to my friend recently
[00:27:11.000] 我最近确实和朋友聊过这件事。
[00:27:13.000] and she was like
[00:27:13.000] 她当时就像
[00:27:15.000] if someone is somewhat rude
[00:27:15.000] 如果有人有点粗鲁的话
[00:27:17.000] or like maybe disagreeable in a meeting
[00:27:17.000] 或者像在会议上令人不快那样。
[00:27:19.000] the craziest thing that you could do
[00:27:19.000] 你能做的最疯狂的事
[00:27:21.000] is like smile
[00:27:21.000] 就像微笑
[00:27:23.000] like have a huge smile on your face
[00:27:23.000] 脸上挂着灿烂的笑容
[00:27:25.000] like flex the smile
[00:27:25.000] 就像展现笑容一样
[00:27:27.000] and I was like wow I never thought of
[00:27:27.000] 我当时就想，哇，我从来没想过这个问题。
[00:27:29.000] smiling as something that's like empowering
[00:27:29.000] 微笑就像一种赋予力量的东西
[00:27:31.000] so I feel like if it is empowering to you
[00:27:31.000] 所以我觉得，如果它能给你带来力量，那就太好了。
[00:27:33.000] then it totally is a power move
[00:27:33.000] 那这绝对是一种强硬手段。
[00:27:35.000] but if it's something that's forced on you
[00:27:35.000] 但如果是被迫的呢？
[00:27:37.000] then you don't have to take it
[00:27:37.000] 那么你就不必服用它了。
[00:27:39.000] so it feels nice to have options
[00:27:39.000] 所以有选择的感觉真好。
[00:27:41.000] wow now everything's just a power move
[00:27:41.000] 哇，现在什么都成了权力游戏了。
[00:27:43.000] I think I need more power in my life
[00:27:43.000] 我觉得我需要更多的人生力量。
[00:27:45.000] yeah
[00:27:45.000] 是的
[00:27:47.000] I'm gonna think about
[00:27:47.000] 我得好好想想。
[00:27:49.000] my power moves next time
[00:27:49.000] 下次我的力量会发挥作用
[00:27:51.000] in my meetings should I smile
[00:27:51.000] 在会议上我应该微笑吗？
[00:27:53.000] or should I straight face
[00:27:53.000] 或者我应该面无表情
[00:27:55.000] okay low key but sometimes if it's like a giant meeting
[00:27:55.000] 好吧，低调点，但有时候如果像大型会议那样的话。
[00:27:57.000] or like a larger meeting
[00:27:57.000] 或者像一次大型会议
[00:27:59.000] that I'm not too invested in
[00:27:59.000] 我并没有投入太多精力。
[00:28:01.000] I just start like doing work
[00:28:01.000] 我突然就喜欢上工作了。
[00:28:03.000] you know like and I'm probably
[00:28:03.000] 你知道，就像我可能
[00:28:05.000] just like blank faced
[00:28:05.000] 就像面无表情一样
[00:28:07.000] as I'm like doing work
[00:28:07.000] 就像我在工作一样
[00:28:09.000] and on the camera
[00:28:09.000] 以及在摄像机上
[00:28:11.000] that's the true power move when you're not even listening to me
[00:28:11.000] 当你根本不听我说话的时候，那才是真正的厉害之处。
[00:28:13.000] you're right
[00:28:13.000] 你说得对
[00:28:15.000] you're right
[00:28:15.000] 你说得对
[00:28:17.000] I've also had a small realization
[00:28:17.000] 我也渐渐意识到了一件事。
[00:28:19.000] kind of similar to how
[00:28:19.000] 有点像这样
[00:28:21.000] like something so simple as
[00:28:21.000] 就像这样简单的事情
[00:28:23.000] taking control of your emotions in a meeting
[00:28:23.000] 在会议中控制自己的情绪
[00:28:25.000] can be
[00:28:25.000] 可以是
[00:28:27.000] mine is that maybe the sun is
[00:28:27.000] 我的想法是，也许太阳是
[00:28:29.000] like nice to see
[00:28:29.000] 很高兴看到
[00:28:31.000] maybe it is
[00:28:31.000] 或许是这样
[00:28:33.000] useful for us
[00:28:33.000] 对我们有用
[00:28:35.000] maybe the sun does bring
[00:28:35.000] 或许太阳真的会带来
[00:28:37.000] joy
[00:28:37.000] 喜悦
[00:28:39.000] because earlier this week
[00:28:39.000] 因为本周早些时候
[00:28:41.000] it was really sunny and nice
[00:28:41.000] 阳光明媚，天气宜人。
[00:28:43.000] and I was driving
[00:28:43.000] 当时我正在开车。
[00:28:45.000] somewhere I forget where
[00:28:45.000] 我忘了具体是哪里了。
[00:28:47.000] and I was just like wow
[00:28:47.000] 我当时就想，哇！
[00:28:49.000] it is such a beautiful
[00:28:49.000] 它真美
[00:28:51.000] day today like anything is
[00:28:51.000] 今天就像其他任何事情一样。
[00:28:53.000] possible and I drove home and I was like
[00:28:53.000] 有可能，我开车回家，然后我就想
[00:28:55.000] okay I'm gonna do whatever I want now
[00:28:55.000] 好了，我现在想做什么就做什么。
[00:28:59.000] dude actually that's so true
[00:28:59.000] 老兄，说得太对了。
[00:29:01.000] and I think it's almost always
[00:29:01.000] 我觉得几乎总是如此
[00:29:03.000] April of every year
[00:29:03.000] 每年四月
[00:29:05.000] where I have this realization and I'm like
[00:29:05.000] 我突然意识到这一点，然后我就想：
[00:29:07.000] wait I don't hate my life
[00:29:07.000] 等等，我并不讨厌我的生活
[00:29:09.000] but for some reason every winter I'm like
[00:29:09.000] 但不知为何，每到冬天我都会这样
[00:29:11.000] still just as shocked at my
[00:29:11.000] 我仍然对我的情况感到震惊
[00:29:13.000] seasonal depression dude right like
[00:29:13.000] 季节性抑郁症，老兄，对吧？
[00:29:15.000] when we did that episode
[00:29:15.000] 我们制作那一集的时候
[00:29:17.000] in January where we were
[00:29:17.000] 一月份我们在那里
[00:29:19.000] similarly talking about our life updates
[00:29:19.000] 同样地，我们也在谈论我们的生活近况。
[00:29:21.000] and like what was going on
[00:29:21.000] 以及当时发生的事情
[00:29:23.000] and I was like wow I'm like
[00:29:23.000] 我当时就想，哇，我简直……
[00:29:25.000] kind of bummed lately you know
[00:29:25.000] 最近有点沮丧，你知道吗？
[00:29:27.000] I can't do anything
[00:29:27.000] 我什么都做不了。
[00:29:29.000] I feel like no will to
[00:29:29.000] 我感觉自己没有意志力
