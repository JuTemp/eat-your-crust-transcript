[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:15.360] Today we wanted to talk about kind of a unique event in our lives, which is high school 10-year
[00:00:15.360] 今天我们想聊聊我们生活中一件比较特别的事情，那就是高中毕业十周年纪念日。
[00:00:24.280] reunions. It's kind of crazy to think that we are at that time now. I feel like when we were actually
[00:00:24.280] 重聚。想到我们现在竟然身处那个时代，感觉有点不可思议。我觉得我们当时真的……
[00:00:31.860] in high school, the thought of the 10-year reunion seems so far and foreign maybe. Now it's like,
[00:00:31.860] 高中时，十年同学聚会似乎遥不可及，甚至有些陌生。而现在，感觉就像是……
[00:00:39.640] damn, we're here. Yeah, somehow I feel like there was more anticipation about a 10-year reunion
[00:00:39.640] 哎，我们到这儿了。是啊，不知怎的，我感觉大家对十年同学聚会的期待比这次还要高。
[00:00:45.880] a couple years back. And then now that the actual 10-year reunions are happening,
[00:00:45.880] 几年前。而现在，真正的十年同学聚会就要开始了。
[00:00:50.700] it's interesting to see who steps up in the, I guess, quote unquote, student body. Also,
[00:00:50.700] 看看在所谓的“学生群体”中，谁会挺身而出，这很有意思。此外，
[00:00:57.960] who is still excited to go, who is trying not to go and see those paths diverge a little bit.
[00:00:57.960] 有些人仍然兴致勃勃地想要去，有些人则尽量避免去，看看这两条路会不会稍微分岔一些。
[00:01:03.420] And I think it's especially interesting too for us because both you and I have kind of moved back
[00:01:03.420] 而且我觉得这对我们来说也特别有意思，因为你我都算是搬回了家。
[00:01:09.500] into the general Bay Area, which is our hometown and where our high schools were.
[00:01:09.500] 进入旧金山湾区，那里是我们的家乡，也是我们上高中的地方。
[00:01:14.580] Yeah.
[00:01:14.580] 是的。
[00:01:15.300] So I feel like we also have different perspectives from people who moved away,
[00:01:15.300] 所以我觉得我们和那些搬走的人也会有不同的看法。
[00:01:19.640] went to college, out of state, etc.
[00:01:19.640] 去外州上大学等等。
[00:01:22.280] So true. It can be a long journey to come back because usually these reunions are held
[00:01:22.280] 确实如此。重聚之路可能漫长，因为这些重聚通常都是在……举行。
[00:01:28.420] in the hometown area of the high school. And I feel like just the concept of seeing all these people
[00:01:28.420] 在高中所在的家乡地区。我觉得光是看到这么多人就让人激动不已。
[00:01:35.340] again is so nostalgic, but also maybe like a little anxiety-inducing.
[00:01:35.340] 再次感受到那种怀旧之情，但同时也可能让人有些焦虑。
[00:01:43.200] Well, it's interesting that you say that because, Crystal, you actually hosted your high school's
[00:01:43.200] 嗯，你说得真有意思，因为，克丽丝塔尔，你实际上主持过你们高中的……
[00:01:49.940] 10-year reunion recently. So what inspired you to step up and take on that role?
[00:01:49.940] 最近我们学校举办了十周年同学聚会。是什么激励你挺身而出，承担起这个角色呢？
[00:01:55.100] Honestly, I wanted to attend a 10-year reunion. It's just like an interesting event to go to,
[00:01:55.100] 说实话，我本来想参加十年同学聚会的。这感觉像是个挺有意思的活动。
[00:02:02.720] to see how everyone has grown up and matured and catch up with people who maybe you were close with
[00:02:02.720] 看看大家长大成熟了多少，也和以前可能很亲近的人叙叙旧。
[00:02:09.300] in high school, but just ended up not really keeping in contact with afterwards.
[00:02:09.300] 高中时认识，但之后就没怎么联系了。
[00:02:15.460] How I ended up hosting my 10-year reunion, I actually reached out to my class president,
[00:02:15.460] 至于我最终如何筹办我的十年同学聚会，其实是我主动联系了我的班长。
[00:02:22.200] who I think that is traditionally the person who is in charge of planning this stuff.
[00:02:22.200] 我认为，传统上负责规划这些事情的人就是他。
[00:02:27.500] I asked her if she was planning on organizing this event. And she was like,
[00:02:27.500] 我问她是否打算组织这个活动。她回答说：
[00:02:33.820] no, not really. I'm not super invested, have little to no interest in hosting it.
[00:02:33.820] 不，其实不是。我没那么投入，对主持这个活动也没什么兴趣。
[00:02:41.760] I think also at the time, she was out of state, so it would have been difficult for her.
[00:02:41.760] 我认为当时她也不在州内，所以对她来说会很困难。
[00:02:47.900] And at first, I was like, oh, okay, that's a shame. But as the year went by, I was like,
[00:02:47.900] 一开始，我觉得，哦，好吧，真可惜。但随着时间的推移，我的想法变成了，
[00:02:53.580] maybe it would be kind of sad if we truly didn't have a reunion. Sure, maybe some people have the
[00:02:53.580] 如果我们真的没有重聚，也许会有点遗憾。当然，也许有些人有……
[00:03:00.720] stance of, I don't want to go. But there could be just as many people who have the mindset of
[00:03:00.720] 有些人持“我不想去”的态度。但同样也有很多人抱有这种想法。
[00:03:06.300] wanting to go. And so it would truly be a shame if we didn't have one just because these select few
[00:03:06.300] 他们都想去。所以，如果仅仅因为这少数人，我们就没能举办一次，那真是太可惜了。
[00:03:12.780] people didn't want to go. Right. So I thought it would be better to have one than to not. So I
[00:03:12.780] 人们不想去。没错。所以我认为，办一个总比不办要好。所以我
[00:03:19.280] asked our class president again, just to help out a little bit in terms of contact info and reaching
[00:03:19.280] 我再次询问了班长，希望能在联系方式方面提供一些帮助。
[00:03:25.960] out to people, that kind of stuff. But I was like, if you don't want to plan it, I can throw something
[00:03:25.960] 跟大家说说，诸如此类的事情。但我当时就想，如果你不想计划，我可以随便办点什么。
[00:03:30.840] together. And it turned out not to be too difficult. So it worked out in the end. So then what do you
[00:03:30.840] 一起合作。结果发现并没有太难。所以最终还是成功了。那么，你接下来会怎么做？
[00:03:36.760] think ended up being a lot easier than you thought? And what were some of the more challenging aspects?
[00:03:36.760] 你觉得最终结果比你想象的要容易得多吗？其中最具挑战性的方面有哪些？
[00:03:43.300] Okay, I'm not even gonna lie. It wasn't hard at all. If anyone has ever planned an event,
[00:03:43.300] 好吧，我实话实说，这根本不难。任何策划过活动的人都会明白，
[00:03:53.640] like even their own birthday party, I feel like it's very similar.
[00:03:53.640] 我觉得就连他们自己的生日派对都非常相似。
[00:03:59.400] So maybe something that was slightly more challenging is like, reaching out to people.
[00:03:59.400] 所以，也许更具挑战性的事情是，比如，与人沟通。
[00:04:04.360] I don't know if people's high school emails are the emails they're still using now. Right. Our class has a
[00:04:04.360] 我不知道大家高中时的邮箱地址是不是现在还在用的邮箱。没错。我们班有一个
[00:04:09.920] little Facebook group. So I posted in there. And honestly, it was just like, if you see it, you see it.
[00:04:09.920] 那是一个很小的脸书群组。所以我发了个帖子。说实话，感觉就是，你看到了就看到了。
[00:04:14.400] I think if people wanted to attend, they would they would make an effort to figure out if it's happening.
[00:04:14.400] 我认为如果人们想参加，他们会努力弄清楚这件事是否会发生。
[00:04:19.460] Yeah. Yeah. But like, honestly, reaching out to a location, figuring out that stuff ended up being
[00:04:19.460] 是啊，是啊。但说实话，联系到某个地方，弄清楚那些事情最终还是……
[00:04:27.440] even easier than I thought. Maybe it's because the place I chose ended up just being like really
[00:04:27.440] 比我想象的还要容易。也许是因为我选择的那个地方最终真的就像……
[00:04:32.480] chill about it. I was like, hey, can I rent out a space for like around 150 people? And they're
[00:04:32.480] 别紧张。我当时就问，嘿，我能租个场地容纳大概150人吗？他们说……
[00:04:37.980] like, yeah, for sure. Fill out a form online. You're set. Okay, that was like super easy.
[00:04:37.980] 没错，当然可以。在线填写一份表格就行了。搞定！好，这简直太简单了。
[00:04:44.200] I feel like the venue you chose was nice too, because it wasn't like a venue that had super strict
[00:04:44.200] 我觉得你选的场地也挺好的，因为它不像有些场地那样限制特别多。
[00:04:49.900] entry rules or anything like that. I feel like that would have added a layer of complexity.
[00:04:49.900] 比如参赛规则之类的。我觉得那样会增加复杂性。
[00:04:53.920] And it also wasn't a place that had a strict capacity of like, it's going to feel really
[00:04:53.920] 而且那里也没有严格的容量限制，不会让人感觉很拥挤。
[00:04:59.720] squished if more than X number of people show up. Yeah. So then I feel like having that flexibility
[00:04:59.720] 如果来的人超过X个，场地就会被挤扁。是的。所以我感觉有这种灵活性很重要。
[00:05:04.640] did help the logistics feel a lot more smoother and more seamless. Maybe like the only downside was that
[00:05:04.640] 确实让物流流程感觉更加顺畅无缝。或许唯一的缺点就是……
[00:05:11.420] it was outdoors. And so it did get a little cold at night. But I think for the most part, it was
[00:05:11.420] 因为是在户外，所以晚上会有点冷。但我觉得大部分时间里，
[00:05:16.540] like pretty solid. It didn't end up being that cold that day. Luckily.
[00:05:16.540] 感觉挺结实的。那天最后并没有那么冷。幸好如此。
[00:05:20.360] I know, which is crazy, because I work actually pretty closely to where that venue is. So then
[00:05:20.360] 我知道，这很不可思议，因为我的工作地点离那个场地其实很近。
[00:05:27.800] the week prior, I had gone out to dinner with my friend and it was like the coldest day of all time.
[00:05:27.800] 前一周，我和朋友出去吃饭，那天冷得像世界最冷的一天。
[00:05:32.860] I was like, oh my god, thank god I have this brand new puffer jacket that I bought. Otherwise,
[00:05:32.860] 我当时想，天哪，幸好我买了这件全新的羽绒服。不然的话，
[00:05:38.080] I wouldn't survive this cold. And when I was there eating with my friend, I was like, dude,
[00:05:38.080] 我受不了这寒冷的天气。当时我和朋友在那儿吃饭，我就想，老兄，
[00:05:42.520] we're fucked next week. Like it's gonna be so cold. But then seven days pass, all the rain stops,
[00:05:42.520] 下周我们完蛋了。感觉会冷得要命。但七天过去了，雨却停了。
[00:05:49.220] like the cold freeze or whatever was gone. The bomb cyclone or whatever was also far into the past.
[00:05:49.220] 就像严寒之类的天气已经过去了。炸弹气旋之类的灾害也早已成为过去。
[00:05:56.360] And it was just like a perfectly nice, mildly chilly day. It was great.
[00:05:56.360] 那天天气晴朗，微凉宜人，真是太棒了。
[00:06:00.840] I was thankful for that. I think I was slightly worried about weather. But also at the same time,
[00:06:00.840] 我对此很感激。我想我当时有点担心天气。但与此同时，
[00:06:05.740] we're in California. So I was like, we'll probably be okay.
[00:06:05.740] 我们在加州。所以我就想，我们大概没事吧。
[00:06:08.720] You're like, there's gonna be no snow.
[00:06:08.720] 你会想，不会下雪的。
[00:06:12.060] Okay, but as you mentioned, you actually went to my high school reunion. So how did that feel
[00:06:12.060] 好吧，不过正如你所说，你确实参加了我的高中同学聚会。感觉如何？
[00:06:18.760] as someone who didn't go to like, my high school?
[00:06:18.760] 作为一个没上过我那所高中的人？
[00:06:22.100] I think it was a very interesting experience. And I was actually more excited to go to
[00:06:22.100] 我觉得这是一次非常有趣的经历。事实上，我当时更兴奋的是……
[00:06:26.640] this one than my high school reunion. But there was a couple things that I felt. So
[00:06:26.640] 这次比我高中同学聚会还要特别。但我有几点感受。
[00:06:32.500] one was I thought more people would bring plus ones. I was surprised to see that there wasn't a ton.
[00:06:32.500] 其中一个原因是，我以为会有更多人带伴侣。结果发现带伴侣的人并不多，这让我很惊讶。
[00:06:40.440] And you know, it's not that I know that many people that went to your high school and were in
[00:06:40.440] 你知道，并不是说我认识很多上过你高中并且……的人。
[00:06:45.180] your class. So I guess I wouldn't have been able to decipher who exactly was a plus one and who wasn't
[00:06:45.180] 你们班。所以我想我没办法分辨出谁是带了一位同学，谁不是。
[00:06:50.700] from a distance. Right. But from what I could see, most people were chatting about high school
[00:06:50.700] 从远处看，没错。但就我所见，大多数人都在聊高中生活。
[00:06:55.320] memories and whatnot. The only plus ones that I can kind of figure out were the ones that I already
[00:06:55.320] 回忆之类的。我唯一能勉强弄明白的加分项就是那些我已经知道的了。
[00:07:00.520] knew. We kind of had a little plus one huddle in the corner, which was nice. Honestly, like going to
[00:07:00.520] 我知道。我们俩在角落里围成一小圈，感觉挺好的。说实话，就像去……
[00:07:08.480] your high school reunion, I kind of felt like damn, it's a shame that I won't be able to go to ours.
[00:07:08.480] 看到你的高中同学聚会，我心里想，唉，真可惜我不能参加我们的聚会。
[00:07:13.100] Because it kind of felt very special being there. And this is the mindset that I kind of had not
[00:07:13.100] 因为待在那里感觉很特别。而这正是我之前从未有过的心态。
[00:07:20.920] going to mind slash what I think a lot of people might commonly feel is you know what I'm like close
[00:07:20.920] 想到这里，我觉得很多人可能都有这种感觉，你知道我有点像那种人。
[00:07:27.060] by to my hometown. I still talk to a ton of high school people. If I wanted to keep up with them
[00:07:27.060] 回到家乡。我仍然和很多高中同学保持联系。如果我想和他们保持联系的话。
[00:07:32.760] or catch up with them, I would be in touch with them still. What is the true value added of me going
[00:07:32.760] 或者跟他们叙叙旧，我还是会跟他们保持联系。我去那里的真正价值是什么？
[00:07:39.680] to like a reunion? Right. But actually being there, I was like, you know, there is something special
[00:07:39.680] 像同学聚会那样？没错。但真正身临其境时，我感觉，你知道，这其中确实有种特别的氛围。
[00:07:45.600] about getting everyone in one place and hanging out because that's what truly takes you back to like
[00:07:45.600] 把大家聚在一起，一起玩耍，因为这才是真正能让你回到过去的感觉。
[00:07:51.060] school times. Yeah, like you don't get that same vibe hanging out one on one or with like a group of
[00:07:51.060] 上学时间。是啊，就像你和一个人或者一群人出去玩的时候，感受不到那种氛围。
[00:07:57.040] people. You only get that Oh, we're at like a school assembly vibe when there's 150 of your classmates
[00:07:57.040] 人。只有当你的同学有150人时，你才会感受到那种“哦，我们好像在参加学校集会”的氛围。
[00:08:04.600] at a beer garden outdoors on a cold night. It did feel very special. And I was like, this is awesome.
[00:08:04.600] 在一个寒冷的夜晚，在露天啤酒花园里。感觉真的很特别。我当时就想，这太棒了。
[00:08:11.980] But I will say I felt like I had to fend for myself a little bit as a plus one because I didn't want to
[00:08:11.980] 但我必须说，作为同行者，我感觉自己得稍微照顾一下自己，因为我不想……
[00:08:17.360] be like the old ball and chain being like, Oh, introduce me to all of your classmates.
[00:08:17.360] 就像老鸨一样，说：“哦，把我介绍给你的所有同学吧。”
[00:08:22.780] James. Yeah, yeah. I mean, honestly, I feel like a lot of people that ended up going I maybe knew
[00:08:22.780] 詹姆斯：是啊，是啊。说实话，我觉得很多最终去的人，我可能都认识。
[00:08:31.120] their face or I knew their name, but then I like didn't remember the other part. Yeah, I knew their
[00:08:31.120] 他们的脸或者名字我都记得，但其他信息我就想不起来了。是的，我认识他们
[00:08:36.400] face, but I forgot their name or I knew their name, but I forgot their face. At first, I was too
[00:08:36.400] 我记得他们的脸，但忘了他们的名字；或者我知道他们的名字，但忘了他们的长相。起初，我太……
[00:08:41.500] embarrassed, I guess to be like, Oh, what was your name again? But I think towards the middle and like
[00:08:41.500] 尴尬的时候，我大概会想，哦，你叫什么名字来着？但我觉得到了中间部分，就像……
[00:08:47.340] after more people came, it felt way more normal. And like understandable to be like, Oh my god,
[00:08:47.340] 人多了之后，感觉就正常多了。也能理解大家为什么会发出“我的天哪”这样的感叹。
[00:08:53.640] I remember you. But like, I totally forgot your name. I'm so sorry. So I wonder if anyone came up
[00:08:53.640] 我记得你。但是，我完全忘了你的名字。真抱歉。所以我想知道有没有人想起你。
[00:08:59.040] to you and said that. So actually, you and your boyfriend and me and James, the four of us carpooled.
[00:08:59.040] 跟你说过这话。所以实际上，你、你男朋友、我还有詹姆斯，我们四个人拼车去的。
[00:09:08.120] Right. And when we had gotten to the venue, there was already like a little group of people who had
[00:09:08.120] 没错。当我们到达场地时，已经有一小群人在那里等着了。
[00:09:13.620] showed up and were kind of like excited to hang out and chat. And when the four of us walked up to that
[00:09:13.620] 他们来了，看起来挺兴奋的，想出来聚聚聊聊天。我们四个人走到他们跟前的时候……
[00:09:19.220] group, this guy turned around and said to me, he was like, Oh, I remember we like chatted a little
[00:09:19.220] 一群人中，有一个人转过身来对我说，他好像是这么说的：“哦，我记得我们好像聊了一会儿。”
[00:09:24.740] bit. But I had no idea who this person was. And I just thought it was funny that he said it to me
[00:09:24.740] 确实有点。但我完全不知道这个人是谁。我只是觉得他跟我说这话挺搞笑的。
[00:09:30.700] first and then turned to James. So in my head, I was like, Oh my god, I'm like assimilating into
[00:09:30.700] 先是转向詹姆斯，然后才转向他。所以我当时想，天哪，我好像正在融入他。
[00:09:35.920] the world of this high school. You're like, I'm basically this high school alumni. Yeah.
[00:09:35.920] 这就是这所高中的世界。你会觉得，我基本上就是这所高中的校友。没错。
[00:09:42.960] We like shook hands. And I was like, Yeah, it's so nice to see you again. Because I didn't want to
[00:09:42.960] 我们握了握手。我说：“是啊，很高兴再次见到你。”因为我不想……
[00:09:47.400] be like, I'm a plus one. I didn't go here. So I was just like quietly trying to pretend like I was
[00:09:47.400] 就好像，我是陪同来的。我没来这里。所以我只能默默地假装自己是。
[00:09:54.760] one of you guys. I know at one point in the night, someone was chatting with me and a few other
[00:09:54.760] 你们其中一个。我知道那天晚上某个时候，有人和我还有其他几个人聊过天。
[00:10:01.980] people. And then they turned to my boyfriend and was like, Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't quite remember
[00:10:01.980] 一群人。然后他们转向我男朋友，说：“哦，真抱歉。” 我不太记得了。
[00:10:07.480] who you are. And he was like, Oh, no, I'm like a plus one. Don't like you don't know me.
[00:10:07.480] 你是谁？然后他就说，哦，不，我只是个陪同人员。别装作不认识我。
[00:10:12.460] Dude, he should have assimilated just like me. There was two paths there.
[00:10:12.460] 兄弟，他本该像我一样融入主流社会的。他本来有两条路可以选择。
[00:10:20.440] No, but then he says his name or something. And then they'd be like, I don't remember that person
[00:10:20.440] 不，但他会说出自己的名字之类的。然后他们就会说，我不记得这个人了。
[00:10:25.060] being in class. And then he gaslights them. He's like, What the fuck? We were PE together.
[00:10:25.060] 当时他们在上课。然后他就开始精神操控他们。他会说：“搞什么鬼？我们一起上过体育课啊。”
[00:10:31.740] Well, it's funny that you say that because I was just hanging out with my friend last night.
[00:10:31.740] 哈哈，你说得真巧，因为我昨晚正好和朋友一起出去玩。
[00:10:35.440] She was telling me that she had recently gone to her fiance's reunion. Yeah. And she said that when
[00:10:35.440] 她告诉我她最近去参加了她未婚夫的同学聚会。是啊。她说当
[00:10:41.800] she got there, there were little name tags for everyone to like write their name on just to like
[00:10:41.800] 她到了那里，发现那里有小小的名牌，每个人都可以在上面写上自己的名字，就像这样。
[00:10:46.920] jog people's memory. But if you were a plus one, you have another neon sticker on top of that
[00:10:46.920] 唤起人们的记忆。但如果你是同行者，你的车上还会再贴一张霓虹贴纸。
[00:10:54.020] designating you a second class citizen slash plus one. And I was like, Oh my god, I don't know how
[00:10:54.020] 这相当于把你降级为二等公民，外加一个等级。我当时就想，我的天哪，我不知道该怎么办
[00:11:00.860] I would feel about that. On one hand, it would help to avoid this awkward moment, you know, where
[00:11:00.860] 我对此会有感觉。一方面，这有助于避免这种尴尬的时刻，你知道，就是那种……
[00:11:05.920] people are confused whether you're a plus one or not. But right. But I feel like in some ways,
[00:11:05.920] 人们会搞不清楚你是不是带了伴侣。没错。但我觉得在某些方面，
[00:11:10.980] it could be potentially alienating slash othering. I don't know. But I think it worked out to her
[00:11:10.980] 这或许会造成疏离或排斥。我不知道。但我认为这对她来说是件好事。
[00:11:17.100] favor because she said she had a little group of other plus ones. And you're like able to easily
[00:11:17.100] 因为她说她带了一小群朋友和伴侣，所以你很容易就能……
[00:11:21.920] identify the other plus ones because of that sticker. They're like, okay, that huddle over
[00:11:21.920] 他们会根据贴纸认出其他加号的人。他们会说，好吧，那群人围在一起
[00:11:26.260] there is just a plus one huddle. That's the safe circle. Also, though, speaking of plus ones,
[00:11:26.260] 只有一个外加一人的圈子。那是安全圈。不过，说到外加一人，
[00:11:34.660] I think I agree with you where I was kind of surprised not more people brought plus ones.
[00:11:34.660] 我同意你的看法，我也很惊讶带伴侣的人不多。
[00:11:40.080] Yeah, I specifically said when I like posted about the event, I was like plus ones are welcome.
[00:11:40.080] 是的，我在发布活动信息的时候特意说了，欢迎携带伴侣。
[00:11:45.480] I was hoping more people would bring plus ones.
[00:11:45.480] 我原本希望更多的人能带伴侣一起来。
[00:11:49.160] You know, what I thought was also funny was when people came into the venue, you can kind of see
[00:11:49.160] 你知道，我觉得还有一点很有趣，就是当人们进入场地时，你可以看出
[00:11:54.560] who they're coming in with. Right. Since I wasn't an alumni, I was like observing, you know, like I
[00:11:54.560] 他们会和谁一起来。没错。因为我不是校友，所以我就像是在观察，你知道，就像我
[00:12:00.740] wasn't the one actively catching up with classmates. I was just like looking around occasionally talking
[00:12:00.740] 我不是那种主动和同学们聊天的人。我只是偶尔看看周围，说说话。
[00:12:04.800] to your boyfriend or some of our other friends plus ones. I thought it was interesting when people
[00:12:04.800] 给你的男朋友或者我们其他朋友带上他们的伴侣。我觉得当人们这样做很有趣。
[00:12:10.380] came in by themselves. Because that's kind of like a power move in my mind, I guess. And I also
[00:12:10.380] 他们自己来的。因为在我看来，这算是一种展现实力的方式吧。而且我
[00:12:17.080] noticed that a bunch of people came in like groups of three or four, which to me is very similar to
[00:12:17.080] 我注意到很多人三五成群地进来，这在我看来非常类似于……
[00:12:24.040] like what happens in high school, you hang out with like your friend groups or like a couple of friends
[00:12:24.040] 就像高中时那样，你会和你的朋友们或者几个朋友一起玩。
[00:12:28.200] and you go do things together. So I was like, Oh my god, this is like very nostalgic, you know?
[00:12:28.200] 然后你们一起做各种事情。所以我就想，天哪，这感觉好怀旧啊，你知道吗？
[00:12:33.460] Yeah, I feel like having a buffer, I guess, one or two people at least to go with definitely makes
[00:12:33.460] 是的，我觉得有个缓冲人，至少一两个人一起出行肯定会有帮助。
[00:12:40.240] you feel less awkward. Probably. When I was putting all this together, I guess like the biggest worry I
[00:12:40.240] 你会感觉没那么尴尬了。大概吧。当我把所有这些事情整理出来的时候，我想我最大的担忧就是……
[00:12:46.400] had was like, what if no one shows up? So I like forced our little friend group. I'm hosting this so
[00:12:46.400] 我当时想，万一没人来怎么办？所以我硬是把我们这几个朋友都拉来了。这次活动是我主办的。
[00:12:52.880] you guys all have to come. Where you texted me, I expect you and James to be there. I was like,
[00:12:52.880] 你们都得来。你给我发短信说，我希望你和詹姆斯都能到。我当时就想，
[00:12:59.860] no worries, we're coming. I was like, this is a very stern text message.
[00:12:59.860] 别担心，我们马上就到。我当时想，这条短信语气好严肃啊。
[00:13:06.650] Yeah, it's funny too, because I think actually most of our friend group who did go to high school
[00:13:06.650] 是啊，也挺搞笑的，因为我觉得我们这群朋友里，真正上过高中的大多数人其实都……
[00:13:12.950] with me were very iffy about the reunion or maybe like on the fence. And then because I ended up
[00:13:12.950] 我当时对重聚这件事非常犹豫，或者说有点摇摆不定。然后因为我最终……
[00:13:19.970] putting it together and kind of forcing everyone, implying that everyone needs to go because I put
[00:13:19.970] 把所有事情都安排好，然后强迫所有人，暗示每个人都必须离开，因为我放了这些话。
[00:13:26.630] it together, they're like, okay, fine, like, I'll go. But I mean, I think even the people who were
[00:13:26.630] 他们会一起想，好吧，行，我去。但我的意思是，我觉得即使是那些……
[00:13:32.350] hesitant about going and honestly, even day of, I feel like before their reunion, there was a little
[00:13:32.350] 我当时很犹豫要不要去，老实说，甚至到了当天，我觉得在他们重聚之前，还是有点……
[00:13:39.450] bit of sentiment of like, is it just going to be us talking in a corner the whole time or something
[00:13:39.450] 有点伤感，心想，难道我们只能一直躲在角落里聊天吗？
[00:13:44.570] like that? Yeah. Despite all of these worries, I think everyone ended up having a good time catching
[00:13:44.570] 那样吗？是的。尽管有这么多担忧，但我认为大家最终都玩得很开心。
[00:13:50.010] up with faces that they forgot about and stuff. And yeah, just like hanging out and chatting. It was
[00:13:50.010] 跟那些他们已经遗忘的面孔重逢，诸如此类。是啊，就像闲逛聊天一样。就是这样。
[00:13:55.350] like very good vibes. Yeah, yeah. I think that was like another thing. The vibes were immaculate,
[00:13:55.350] 感觉特别好。对，对。我觉得那感觉就像是另一回事。气氛完美无瑕。
[00:14:00.910] low key. It really was to the point where I was like chatting with one of your guys's classmates.
[00:14:00.910] 气氛很轻松。真的就像在和你们的某个同学聊天一样。
[00:14:08.170] And he was like, you know, I showed up trying to gather tea and like find out what the latest gossip
[00:14:08.170] 他当时说，你知道，我来这里是想打听一下最新的八卦消息。
[00:14:14.450] is. But no one's been gossiping. It's just been very like wholesome. Yeah. Like, oh, yeah. Like,
[00:14:14.450] 是啊。但没人八卦。气氛一直都很融洽。嗯。就像，哦，是的。就像，
[00:14:19.750] I feel the same way. Like, where's the tea? Yeah, everyone was just like happy to be there
[00:14:19.750] 我也有同感。就像，茶呢？是啊，大家都很高兴能来。
[00:14:25.850] and really friendly. They came with a positive attitude, basically. And I think that's what
[00:14:25.850] 而且他们非常友好。总的来说，他们带着积极的态度而来。我想这就是原因。
[00:14:31.370] really made it. My guess is like maybe people's attitude was like, oh, I'll show up and see how
[00:14:31.370] 真的成功了。我猜可能大家的态度是，哦，我就去看看吧。
[00:14:37.250] it is. Worst case, you know, I can just dip early. Right. No one came like grumpily, if that makes sense.
[00:14:37.250] 确实如此。最坏的情况，你知道，我可以提前离开。没错。没人带着不高兴的神情来，如果我这么说你能理解的话。
[00:14:44.470] Yeah, I guess if you really didn't want to be there, you wouldn't come anyway. Exactly.
[00:14:44.470] 是啊，我想如果你真的不想去，你根本就不会来。没错。
[00:14:47.510] So maybe it weeded out people who would have neutral to negative vibes.
[00:14:47.510] 所以，这或许筛选掉了那些给人感觉中立甚至负面的人。
[00:14:52.550] It was so interesting. A lot of people ended up thanking me for like putting it all together.
[00:14:52.550] 太有趣了。很多人都感谢我把这一切整理出来。
[00:14:57.670] And I was like, oh, it was like no bother. It's fine. I like didn't really think about it as a
[00:14:57.670] 我当时就想，哦，没关系，没什么大不了的。我根本没把它当回事。
[00:15:02.850] thankworthy thing. But it was interesting to see people were like very thankful that it happened.
[00:15:02.850] 值得庆幸的事。但有趣的是，看到人们对这件事的发生表示由衷的感激。
[00:15:10.290] I find it very fascinating, honestly, that you're like, oh, it's like no biggie,
[00:15:10.290] 说实话，我觉得你这种“哦，这没什么大不了的”的态度非常耐人寻味。
[00:15:13.730] because I feel like it's a big task to take on. It's like one thing to do something that's kind of
[00:15:13.730] 因为我觉得这是一项艰巨的任务。这就像做一件……
[00:15:18.810] handed to you slash expected of you. And then another thing to like step up like, yeah, it's
[00:15:18.810] 交给你的，或者说是别人期望你做的。然后还有另一件事需要你挺身而出，就像，是的，就是这样。
[00:15:23.230] fine. I'll just take care of it. Your boyfriend and I were watching you float through the groups
[00:15:23.230] 好的，我会处理的。我和你男朋友刚才看着你穿过人群呢。
[00:15:27.750] throughout the night because the other thing too is that since you're the host, you had all the drink
[00:15:27.750] 整晚都是这样，因为还有一点就是，你是主人，所以所有的酒都由你来喝。
[00:15:31.750] tickets in your hand. Right. So it was almost mandatory that everyone who attended the reunion
[00:15:31.750] 你手里拿着票。没错。所以，几乎所有参加同学聚会的人都必须持有门票。
[00:15:36.170] came up to you and like checked in with you. Yeah. Watching you chat, I think with like everyone
[00:15:36.170] 走过来跟你打招呼，好像问候了一下。嗯。看着你聊天，我觉得你跟每个人都聊了。
[00:15:41.710] who came by was very cool. And it was very cute. Everyone just looked so happy to talk to you
[00:15:41.710] 来的那个人都很酷，而且很可爱。每个人看起来都很高兴能和你聊天。
[00:15:47.550] slash get a drink ticket. At the end of the night, a lot of people came up and were like, hey, do you
[00:15:47.550] 斜杠是获得一张饮料券。当晚结束时，很多人走过来问：“嘿，你愿意吗？”
[00:15:53.550] have like extra drink tickets that people like didn't pick up or something? Yeah. Also, a really
[00:15:53.550] 是不是还有一些多余的饮料券，比如有人没领走的那种？嗯。还有，真的
[00:16:00.370] funny thing is someone bought five tickets because each ticket comes with a drink ticket.
[00:16:00.370] 有趣的是，有人买了五张票，因为每张票都附赠一张饮料券。
[00:16:05.930] At first, I just thought that this person was going to bring four plus ones. But then I realized
[00:16:05.930] 起初，我以为这个人会带四个外加一个朋友。但后来我意识到
[00:16:12.010] because he came up to me, he was like, can I get all those drink tickets? I was like, wait, this guy
[00:16:12.010] 因为他走过来问我，能把那些饮料券都给我吗？我当时就想，等等，这人
[00:16:16.870] ripped himself off because the ticket has the like venue rental baked into it. It's okay. He's
[00:16:16.870] 他亏大了，因为票里包含了场地租赁费之类的东西。没关系。他
[00:16:23.750] contributing to the cause. Yeah. Like this is my investment into the vibes. Yeah. Yeah. But I
[00:16:23.750] 为这项事业贡献力量。是啊。就像这是我对这种氛围的投资。是啊。是啊。但是我
[00:16:30.790] thought that was funny. I was like, oh yeah, I guess that is like a method. You could have just
[00:16:30.790] 我觉得挺搞笑的。我就想，哦，对啊，我猜这算是一种方法吧。你本来可以……
[00:16:34.210] bought a bunch of like drink tickets. Actually, I think we witnessed that conversation. And then
[00:16:34.210] 买了一堆饮料券。实际上，我觉得我们当时目睹了那段对话。然后
[00:16:39.290] me and your boyfriend were just watching and then he turned to us. He's like, guys, I swear I actually
[00:16:39.290] 我和你男朋友当时就在旁边看着，然后他转过头来对我们说：“伙计们，我发誓我真的……”
[00:16:43.930] bought these tickets. I'm not just trying to rip them off of her. So we're like, it's okay.
[00:16:43.930] 这些票是我买的，我不是想骗她的钱。所以我们觉得，没关系。
[00:16:48.270] We didn't think that at all. You're like, actually, it seems more like crystal ripped you off.
[00:16:48.270] 我们完全没这么想。你倒是觉得，实际上，这看起来更像是水晶骗了你。
[00:16:54.370] Well, to an extent, I was shocked to be noticed. I was like, oh my god, I have like a physical body.
[00:16:54.370] 嗯，某种程度上来说，我被人注意到让我很震惊。我当时想，天哪，我居然有实体。
[00:16:59.130] I'm not just a wallflower. Oh my god. Yeah. You mentioned that you're not going to your
[00:16:59.130] 我可不是个壁花。我的天哪。是啊。你提到你不会去你的
[00:17:06.930] reunion though, even after such a dare I say successful
[00:17:06.930] 即便如此，重聚也并非如此成功（我敢说是成功的）。
[00:17:13.330] reunion event. If I do say so myself. But yeah, I am not attending ours. I mean, part of it is just
[00:17:13.330] 同学聚会。恕我自夸一下。不过，我不会参加我们那边的聚会。我的意思是，部分原因只是
[00:17:21.790] logistics. So usually around the holidays, I tend to have a ton of like obligations and plans
[00:17:21.790] 后勤方面。所以通常在节假日期间，我都会有很多事情要做，比如各种安排和计划。
[00:17:28.510] like many people do. And our reunion is actually scheduled to be just a couple days away from
[00:17:28.510] 就像很多人一样。我们的同学聚会实际上就安排在几天后。
[00:17:34.250] Christmas time. So I was like, I think just timing wise, it doesn't work out. There's like
[00:17:34.250] 圣诞节期间。所以我就想，我觉得时间上不太合适。就像……
[00:17:39.450] things I have to do. But I do have a bunch of friends who are going to be going. So they were
[00:17:39.450] 我还有一些事情要做。但我确实有很多朋友要去。所以他们
[00:17:44.910] like, oh, I'll tell you all the tea that happens if there is. Yeah. I know you were more on the
[00:17:44.910] 比如，哦，如果有什么内幕消息，我会告诉你的。是啊。我知道你更倾向于……
[00:17:51.750] skeptical side slash on the fence about going to your own. But do you feel like you were more
[00:17:51.750] 怀疑的一面，或者说对是否要独自生活犹豫不决。但你是否觉得你更……
[00:17:57.110] encouraged to try to go to yours after seeing what like a 10 year reunion looked like?
[00:17:57.110] 看到类似十年同学聚会的盛况后，是否也想去参加你们的聚会呢？
[00:18:04.530] Honestly, yeah. After going to yours, I was like, damn, it sucks out that the like logistics didn't
[00:18:04.530] 说实话，是啊。去了你那儿之后，我就想，哎，物流方面没做好真是太糟糕了。
[00:18:09.790] work out. And I have to miss mine. Because I do think it would have been fun. Yeah. But I will say
[00:18:09.790] 锻炼。我不得不错过我的锻炼。因为我觉得那会很有趣。是啊。但我还是要说
[00:18:15.050] the one factor that does leave a little bit of hesitance for me is your high school class is a
[00:18:15.050] 唯一让我有些犹豫的是，你的高中班级是……
[00:18:22.150] lot bigger than ours. So then I feel like there's a different set of like maybe vibes or expectations
[00:18:22.150] 比我们的大得多。所以我觉得气氛或者期望值可能也不一样。
[00:18:28.350] that come with like a bigger high school class versus a smaller one. Oh, okay. That's fair. That's
[00:18:28.350] 就像高中班级人数多和人数少一样。哦，好吧。这很合理。
[00:18:33.450] fair. I mean, yeah, like ultimately, my class is about 500 people. And we had about 150 people show
[00:18:33.450] 公平。我的意思是，是的，我们班最终大概有500人。而到场的只有大约150人。
[00:18:41.150] up, which I guess like percentage wise, is not the greatest. But at the same time, like 150 is a lot
[00:18:41.150] 虽然增长幅度不算大，但按百分比算，也不算太高。不过，150这个数字也相当可观了。
[00:18:47.830] of people. I feel like that's a huge success. Honestly, I remember our class being like less
[00:18:47.830] 人数很多。我觉得这是个巨大的成功。说实话，我记得我们班以前人数更少。
[00:18:53.670] than 400 people. So I guess quantity wise, it's not like that big of a difference. But there was a
[00:18:53.670] 超过400人。所以我觉得从数量上看，差别并不大。但是确实存在……
[00:18:59.670] little bit of like a smaller high school vibe to our class, I would say. Yeah. And with a lot of
[00:18:59.670] 我觉得我们班有点像小型高中的氛围。是的。而且有很多……
[00:19:04.990] people staying in state, I feel like the circles have just kind of stayed the same. So I don't know
[00:19:04.990] 我觉得留在州内的人，圈子好像一直都没变。所以，我不知道。
[00:19:11.130] what will happen at our reunion. But I'll report back if there's anything interesting.
[00:19:11.130] 同学聚会会发生什么，我也不知道。不过如果有什么有趣的事情发生，我会及时汇报。
[00:19:16.350] Would you drag James with you if you did end up going to yours?
[00:19:16.350] 如果你最终决定去你家，你会带上詹姆斯吗？
[00:19:19.810] Oh, yeah. I don't think I would go by myself. Well, I guess I could have just like,
[00:19:19.810] 哦，是啊。我觉得我不会一个人去。嗯，我想我本来可以自己去的，
[00:19:24.670] gone with a bunch of our friends and whatnot. But from what I've gathered from our
[00:19:24.670] 我们和一群朋友一起去了。但从我了解到的情况来看，
[00:19:29.670] friends, it seems like a decent number of people would bring their plus ones. So maybe ours would
[00:19:29.670] 朋友们，看来会有不少人带伴侣。所以也许我们也会带。
[00:19:35.050] have had more of a plus one vibe than your reunion. That's super cool. I feel like it's just
[00:19:35.050] 感觉更像是带朋友一起参加聚会，而不是你们的同学聚会。这太酷了。我觉得这就像……
[00:19:41.210] so interesting to see like the people a lot of your friends or fellow classmates end up with. And
[00:19:41.210] 看到很多朋友或同学最终都和什么样的人在一起，真的很有意思。
[00:19:47.290] sometimes it's even more interesting because they end up with each other, but you just didn't know.
[00:19:47.290] 有时候事情甚至更有意思，因为他们最终走到了一起，但你却毫不知情。
[00:19:51.850] Oh, yeah, that's true. Did you have anything like that? Your reunion?
[00:19:51.850] 哦，是啊，没错。你们有过类似的经历吗？比如同学聚会？
[00:19:56.650] There was someone who said he ended up dating someone from our class, but she couldn't make
[00:19:56.650] 有人说他最后和我们班的一个女生谈恋爱了，但她没能证实。
[00:20:02.210] it this time. So I was like, whoa, that's crazy. What were some other things that you were like
[00:20:02.210] 这次真是这样。所以我就想，哇，太疯狂了。你当时还遇到过哪些其他类似的事情？
[00:20:07.910] shocked to find out at your reunion? Actually, surprisingly, a lot of people are still in the
[00:20:07.910] 在同学聚会上得知此事是不是很震惊？事实上，令人惊讶的是，很多人仍然……
[00:20:13.010] bay. I mean, I guess like when you think about it, that does seem very reasonable. But I guess I was also
[00:20:13.010] 海湾。我的意思是，仔细想想，这似乎确实很合理。但我猜我当时也是。
[00:20:19.850] at the same time a bit surprised that more people weren't out of state. I feel like a good chunk of
[00:20:19.850] 与此同时，我也有点惊讶，外州的人竟然不多。我觉得很大一部分人……
[00:20:25.070] my class went to school out of state. And I feel like sometimes that results in staying out of state
[00:20:25.070] 我们班的学生都去外州上学了。我觉得有时候这样会导致他们最终留在外州。
[00:20:30.650] for work. But yeah, I think most people who ended up coming are like still in the bay.
[00:20:30.650] 为了工作。不过，我觉得最后来的大多数人应该都还在湾区。
[00:20:36.130] I feel like to me, it's clicking because I think every single person that I talked to
[00:20:36.130] 我觉得我好像找到了感觉，因为我觉得我跟每个人交谈后，都明白了这一点。
[00:20:42.330] at your reunion was an engineer. Like I'm like, not even exaggerating. Yeah.
[00:20:42.330] 你们同学聚会上来了一位工程师。我可真没夸张。真的。
[00:20:47.430] And half of them had been like working at some sort of startup. The other half was like in big tech.
[00:20:47.430] 其中一半人曾在创业公司工作过，另一半人则在大科技公司工作过。
[00:20:52.290] Yeah. So I feel like that's very San Francisco vibes.
[00:20:52.290] 是啊，我觉得这很有旧金山的感觉。
[00:20:55.590] Okay. Yeah, that's true. That's very like my high school vibes, like STEM and all of that.
[00:20:55.590] 好的。没错，确实如此。这很像我高中时的氛围，比如STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）之类的。
[00:21:00.490] But it was also funny because a lot of people I would ask like, oh, are you in like the bay SF or
[00:21:00.490] 但这也很有趣，因为我会问很多人，比如，哦，你在旧金山湾区吗？
[00:21:05.930] whatever? A lot of people were like, dude, I live a couple blocks from this place. Wow.
[00:21:05.930] 什么？很多人都说，哥们儿，我就住在这附近几个街区。哇。
[00:21:11.390] They got lucky with the logistics then.
[00:21:11.390] 他们当时在物流方面运气不错。
[00:21:13.490] I think I had an expectation for 10 year reunions. Maybe like it was a very hyped up expectation because
[00:21:13.490] 我对十年同学聚会抱有很高的期望。或许是期望过高了吧，因为
[00:21:20.690] I feel like in media, it's portrayed as a very dramatic thing. Do you know what I mean?
[00:21:20.690] 我觉得媒体把这件事渲染得非常戏剧化。你明白我的意思吗？
[00:21:27.090] People make their entrance and it's like so dramatic. Everyone watches as like the new person joins the
[00:21:27.090] 人们入场的场面非常戏剧化。每个人都注视着新来的人加入。
[00:21:34.110] event. Yeah.
[00:21:34.110] 活动。是的。
[00:21:35.630] Yeah.
[00:21:35.630] 是的。
[00:21:36.130] There's whispers and goss about who showed up and like with who and like all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:36.130] 到处都是窃窃私语和闲言碎语，说谁来了，和谁一起来的，诸如此类的事情。
[00:21:42.670] But as we mentioned, actually being there, it was just like way more chill and it was just like
[00:21:42.670] 但正如我们提到的，真正身临其境时，感觉要轻松得多，就像……
[00:21:47.130] positive vibes in that aspect. I thought it was kind of funny.
[00:21:47.130] 从这方面来说，感觉挺好的。我觉得挺有意思的。
[00:21:50.550] Yeah, that's a good point. And I feel like also 10 year reunions in the media have some sort of drama,
[00:21:50.550] 是的，你说得对。而且我觉得媒体对十年同学聚会的报道总会有些戏剧性。
[00:21:57.030] like a fight breaks out or like people hook up or something like that.
[00:21:57.030] 比如发生争吵，或者有人发生性关系之类的。
[00:22:00.470] But this one was literally just like, oh my God, like how have you been? Catch up on life and just
[00:22:00.470] 但这次真的就像是，我的天哪，你最近怎么样？聊聊近况，然后就……
[00:22:05.910] things that have happened in the last 10 years. And then everyone went home like no one was
[00:22:05.910] 过去十年里发生的事情。然后大家都回家了，好像什么事都没发生过一样。
[00:22:10.190] belligerent or too drunk or being mean or gossipy. It was just like very wholesome.
[00:22:10.190] 它既不好斗，也不喝得烂醉，更不会刻薄或爱嚼舌根。它就是非常健康向上。
[00:22:17.230] Yeah. I think it's also interesting because these like 10 year reunions or whatever are kind of
[00:22:17.230] 是的。我觉得这也挺有意思的，因为这些十年同学聚会之类的活动，其实挺……
[00:22:23.870] universal almost. My parents have talked about having reunions, but for them, it wasn't high
[00:22:23.870] 几乎是普遍现象。我的父母也谈过举办同学聚会，但对他们来说，这并非一件大事。
[00:22:31.030] school. It was college because their college class was like really small. And so they ended up knowing
[00:22:31.030] 学校。是大学，因为他们的大学班级规模很小。所以他们最终认识了彼此。
[00:22:37.290] everyone. Unlike us, I feel like it would be impossible to like even know more than, I don't
[00:22:37.290] 每个人。和我们不同，我觉得不可能知道得更多，我甚至不知道。
[00:22:43.530] know, 10 people in our college class. Right.
[00:22:43.530] 我知道，我们班上只有10个人。没错。
[00:22:45.970] But my parents said for them, it's a 20 year reunion because there's a Chinese song that references
[00:22:45.970] 但我父母说，对他们来说，这是一次20周年同学聚会，因为有一首中文歌提到了这件事。
[00:22:52.770] like 20, like see you in 20 years. So they don't do 10 year reunions. They do 20 year reunion.
[00:22:52.770] 就像“20年后再见”一样。所以他们不搞10年同学聚会，只搞20年同学聚会。
[00:22:58.850] Wow. That's pretty cool. Honestly. I do think too, like the 20 year reunion would be more
[00:22:58.850] 哇，真酷。说真的，我也觉得，像20周年同学聚会那样的活动会更有意义。
[00:23:05.950] memorable or like monumental, I guess, because that's when you can truly look back and feel
[00:23:05.950] 我想，应该是令人难忘的，或者说意义非凡的，因为只有当那一天你才能真正回首往事，并感受到那种意义。
[00:23:10.950] nostalgic. Like I feel like 10 year, I don't feel removed enough yet.
[00:23:10.950] 怀旧。感觉好像过了十年，但还没完全脱离过去。
[00:23:14.930] True, true. I'm like, that was just yesterday that we were all like seniors.
[00:23:14.930] 没错，没错。我感觉好像昨天我们还都是高年级学生似的。
[00:23:19.390] So true. Oh my God. Actually, speaking of that, there were a few people who were like,
[00:23:19.390] 说得太对了。我的天哪。其实，说到这个，确实有几个人是这么说的：
[00:23:25.230] so 20 year reunion. And I was like, oh my God, like I didn't even think people would actually
[00:23:25.230] 所以，20周年同学聚会。我当时就想，我的天哪，我根本没想到会有人真的来。
[00:23:29.930] be down for a 20 year reunion. Like you said, by 20 years, you definitely feel more removed.
[00:23:29.930] 我很乐意参加20周年同学聚会。就像你说的，20年后，你肯定会感觉彼此疏远了很多。
[00:23:36.710] Right. And you probably have even less contact with everyone.
[00:23:36.710] 没错。而且你可能跟其他人接触更少。
[00:23:39.910] You know, like posting about this event on Facebook would not work out. Like probably
[00:23:39.910] 你知道，在脸书上发布这件事的信息可能行不通。大概吧。
[00:23:44.950] no one is even checking that kind of stuff. Yeah. So I was surprised that some people were
[00:23:44.950] 根本没人查这种东西。是啊。所以我很惊讶居然有人会这么做。
[00:23:49.830] like, oh my God, like hopefully we'll have a 20 year reunion. It's like, dang. Okay.
[00:23:49.830] 天哪，但愿我们能办个20周年同学聚会。真是的。好吧。
[00:23:54.650] I guess we'll see what happens when the 20 year rolls around.
[00:23:54.650] 我想我们到时候就知道了，等到20年后会发生什么。
[00:23:58.370] Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if it'll be one of those things where people are more willing to come
[00:23:58.370] 是啊，是啊。我想知道这会不会是那种人们更愿意来参加的活动之一。
[00:24:05.090] now that they're more removed. So then the participation spikes up or I could also see it
[00:24:05.090] 现在他们与外界的距离更远了。所以参与度可能会激增，或者我也能看到这种情况。
[00:24:09.950] going the inverse way where it's like, oh damn, that was a long time ago. Like this doesn't feel
[00:24:09.950] 反过来想，就好像，哦，天哪，那已经是很久以前的事了。感觉不像是真的。
[00:24:14.250] as relevant anymore. So then like less people show up.
[00:24:14.250] 已经不再那么重要了。所以来的人就少了。
[00:24:17.010] I would definitely expect less people to show up than, than for the 10 year. But I mean,
[00:24:17.010] 我预计这次的到场人数肯定会比十周年纪念时少。但我的意思是，
[00:24:21.690] you never know. So I guess we'll see what happens in 20 years. Like if anyone even puts it together,
[00:24:21.690] 谁也说不准。所以我想我们20年后就会看到结果了。比如，到时候会不会有人真的把它整合起来。
[00:24:27.310] just because I hosted the 10 year reunion is not a commitment to me.
[00:24:27.310] 我举办了10周年同学聚会，但这并不代表我对此有义务做出承诺。
[00:24:33.670] You heard it here first. Someone else would have fucking step up in 10 years.
[00:24:33.670] 你在这里听到的可是第一手消息。十年后，肯定会有其他人站出来。
[00:24:39.630] Dude, it's crazy too, because I was also talking to my parents about reunions and whatnot.
[00:24:39.630] 老兄，这也太巧了，因为我当时也在跟父母聊同学聚会之类的事情。
[00:24:44.450] And I think my dad has gone to some, if he could potentially make it like, it's hard for our
[00:24:44.450] 我觉得我爸爸也去过一些地方，如果他能做到的话，对我们来说有点难。
[00:24:50.910] parents too, because they immigrated out of their countries. But recently my mom went to one of her
[00:24:50.910] 父母也是，因为他们移民出了自己的国家。但最近我妈妈去了她其中一个……
[00:24:57.890] reunions and it was an elementary school reunion. Whoa. I know. I was like, dude, do you even remember
[00:24:57.890] 同学聚会，而且还是小学同学聚会。哇哦。我知道。我当时就想，哥们儿，你还记得吗？
[00:25:05.170] like who these people are? And she was like, well, it's different for us because they have,
[00:25:05.170] 这些人是谁？她回答说，嗯，这对我们来说不一样，因为他们有……
[00:25:10.050] you know, a certain class or whatever that they spend like the whole day with and whatnot.
[00:25:10.050] 你知道，就是那种他们一整天都待在一起的某个班级之类的。
[00:25:13.770] But she remembers a couple of them and they have like the tea on what happened to people who like
[00:25:13.770] 但她还记得其中几个人，而且他们似乎对那些喜欢……的人的遭遇了了如指掌。
[00:25:21.170] stayed back in their hometown and whatnot. So my mom was catching up on everything because she had
[00:25:21.170] 他们留在了老家等等。所以我妈妈一直在补习所有的事情，因为她……
[00:25:25.830] moved out of her hometown after she got married. But I just thought that was pretty crazy.
[00:25:25.830] 她结婚后就搬离了家乡。但我当时就觉得这太不可思议了。
[00:25:31.130] Wow. Elementary school. That's yeah, that is crazy.
[00:25:31.130] 哇，小学？真是不可思议。
[00:25:35.090] Dude, she said it was like less than 20 people.
[00:25:35.090] 老兄，她说当时大概不到20个人。
[00:25:37.610] Although I will admit, maybe like having a smaller group to start with,
[00:25:37.610] 虽然我承认，或许一开始从小规模的团队开始会更好，
[00:25:43.770] so like, for example, your mom having elementary school reunion, I'm sure to even begin with,
[00:25:43.770] 比如，举个例子，你妈妈要参加小学同学聚会，我敢肯定，这甚至都还没开始呢。
[00:25:49.210] it was probably maybe like 50 or 60 people max, right? And then you said about 20 people ended up
[00:25:49.210] 大概最多也就五六十人吧？然后你说最后只有二十个人左右。
[00:25:54.530] going. I feel like in those cases, it is definitely more gossipy because like you said,
[00:25:54.530] 去吧。我觉得在那种情况下，八卦肯定更多，因为就像你说的，
[00:26:00.430] they're talking, there's so much more connected like, oh, I can tell this one of 50 person did not
[00:26:00.430] 他们在交谈，彼此之间的联系更加紧密了，比如，哦，我能看出这50个人中有一个人没有……
[00:26:07.110] show up. What's the tea on them? More than likely someone who is there will have heard whispering
[00:26:07.110] 现身吧。他们有什么内幕消息？很可能在场的人会听到一些窃窃私语。
[00:26:13.610] or at least know a little bit about what's going on. But for like a big high school class like mine,
[00:26:13.610] 或者至少了解一些情况。但对于像我所在的这种高中大班来说，
[00:26:19.970] where it's, you know, up to 500 people, you don't know everyone. Even if you think you might
[00:26:19.970] 你知道，在那种多达500人的场合，你不可能认识所有人。即使你认为你可能……
[00:26:25.270] know everyone, you probably don't. That's like a lot of people to remember. And so it's harder to like
[00:26:25.270] 你不可能认识所有人。要记住那么多人可不容易。所以，喜欢他们就更难了。
[00:26:31.730] pick out specific events or like questions to ask almost.
[00:26:31.730] 挑选出具体的事件或想问的问题。
[00:26:36.290] Yeah, that's a good point. I think also like since we are all still fairly connected to high school
[00:26:36.290] 嗯，你说得对。我觉得也因为我们大家和高中仍然保持着相当密切的联系。
[00:26:44.190] people, you're not going to air out dirty laundry of the people that you're close with. Or, you know,
[00:26:44.190] 各位，你们不会把亲近之人的家丑外扬。或者，你知道，
[00:26:50.510] you might not feel as comfortable sharing out to like a group of 150 people like the latest
[00:26:50.510] 你可能不太愿意像最近那样，向150人的群体分享。
[00:26:55.690] craziness that's been going on in your life. But if you're showing up to like your 30 year
[00:26:55.690] 你生活中发生的那些疯狂的事情。但如果你像30岁那样出席……
[00:27:01.590] elementary school, dude, honestly, it's even more because my parents are like 60 something now.
[00:27:01.590] 老兄，说真的，小学的时候就是这样，现在更是如此，因为我父母现在都六十多岁了。
[00:27:07.630] You're probably way more comfortable like sharing details on things that have happened.
[00:27:07.630] 你可能更喜欢分享已经发生的事情的细节。
[00:27:12.350] Yeah. But I will say I asked my mom, I was like, Oh my god, what's the gossip on your elementary
[00:27:12.350] 是的。但我得说，我问过我妈，我说，我的天哪，你们小学都有什么八卦？
[00:27:16.110] school classmates? And she was like, dude, at our age, it's not gossip. It's like sad news about people
[00:27:16.110] 学校同学？她就说，哥们儿，我们这把年纪，这可不是八卦。这就像是关于别人的悲伤消息。
[00:27:22.570] getting sick or passing away. Or I guess the juiciest gossip is like divorce or something,
[00:27:22.570] 生病或去世。或者，我想最劲爆的八卦大概就是离婚之类的吧。
[00:27:28.910] which isn't necessarily fun news. So she was like, yeah, I was just like a little bit sad after,
[00:27:28.910] 这可不是什么令人愉快的消息。所以她就说，是啊，之后我有点难过。
[00:27:34.730] but I guess it was nice to connect with my elementary school friends. And I was like,
[00:27:34.730] 不过，能和小学朋友们联系上感觉真好。当时我就想，
[00:27:39.610] Oh, okay. Doesn't sound very happy. Not what I was hoping to hear.
[00:27:39.610] 哦，好吧。听起来不太高兴。这不是我想听到的。
[00:27:45.170] Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:45.170] 对，没错。
[00:27:46.910] Dude, my parents have a reunion coming up next year. They're going back to China for it.
[00:27:46.910] 兄弟，我爸妈明年要参加家庭聚会，他们要回中国。
[00:27:52.150] Wait, that's so cute.
[00:27:52.150] 等等，这也太可爱了吧。
[00:27:53.430] Yeah, it's a college reunion. I think because their class is so much smaller. So I think it's like
[00:27:53.430] 对，是大学同学聚会。我想是因为他们那一届的人数少得多。所以我觉得就像……
[00:28:00.370] their department reunion kind of they majored in whatever. So it's like all the people in that year
[00:28:00.370] 他们的系同学聚会，就是那种他们主修什么专业的聚会。所以就像是那一年所有同学的聚会。
[00:28:06.250] who took this major are reunionizing. And I think because it's like a smaller group, they almost feel
[00:28:06.250] 那些修读过这个专业的同学正在重聚。我想，因为这是一个较小的群体，他们几乎感觉……
[00:28:15.350] more obligated to go. And so they're making the effort to like fly back to China next year and
[00:28:15.350] 他们更有义务前往。所以他们正努力争取明年飞回中国。
[00:28:22.050] try to go to the reunion. Unless of course, logistically, it doesn't work out. But as
[00:28:22.050] 尽量去参加同学聚会。当然，除非实际操作上行不通。但是，
[00:28:26.470] of now, they're like, okay, we're blocking off these two months because it could be happening
[00:28:26.470] 现在，他们的想法是，好吧，我们先把这两个月的时间都预留出来，因为这种情况可能会发生。
[00:28:30.650] in between this time. And I was like, whoa, dedication.
[00:28:30.650] 在这段时间里，我心想，哇，这真是太敬业了。
[00:28:35.070] That is so cute, honestly. And I'm sure when they come in, everyone's like, oh my god,
[00:28:35.070] 说真的，这太可爱了。我敢肯定，当他们进来的时候，每个人都会惊呼：“我的天哪！”
[00:28:39.790] like all the way from California, USA.
[00:28:39.790] 就像来自遥远的美国加利福尼亚州一样。
[00:28:43.970] Yeah, like I wonder in that generation, how many people ended up immigrating out. It's probably
[00:28:43.970] 是啊，我很好奇那一代人里，最终有多少人移民去了国外。大概吧。
[00:28:50.270] really crazy then for like reunions to see these people who left the country come back
[00:28:50.270] 那时候真的太疯狂了，就像重聚一样，看到那些离开祖国的人回来。
[00:28:56.130] and catch up with them.
[00:28:56.130] 并与他们取得联系。
[00:28:58.290] Oh, yeah, I'm sure. It's such a different experience too from us probably. But who knows,
[00:28:58.290] 哦，是啊，我肯定。这可能跟我们经历的完全不同。不过谁知道呢。
[00:29:04.190] maybe in like a couple decades, we will be in similar positions.
[00:29:04.190] 或许再过二三十年，我们就会处于类似的境地。
[00:29:08.710] Okay, I have a question for us. Yeah. If you saw there was news about a 50 year high
[00:29:08.710] 好的，我有个问题想问大家。是的。你们有没有看到新闻，说气温达到了50年来的最高点？
[00:29:16.290] school reunion, would you go?
[00:29:16.290] 你会参加同学聚会吗？
[00:29:19.690] Wait, 50 years? I need to do the math. I guess we would be like 68. Oh, I would totally go.
[00:29:19.690] 等等，50年？我得算算。我猜我们那时候都68岁了。哦，我肯定会去。
[00:29:25.270] Oh my god.
[00:29:25.270] 我的天啊。
[00:29:26.230] Yeah.
[00:29:26.230] 是的。
[00:29:28.070] Okay, good to know.
[00:29:28.070] 好的，知道了。
[00:29:30.450] You're like, I'm not gonna plan the 20 year, but I'll plan the fucking 50 year.
[00:29:30.450] 你就像在说，我不会规划未来20年，但我会规划未来50年。
[00:29:35.250] No, but also, you're right, because we'd be pretty old by then. And so we probably have
[00:29:35.250] 不，但你说得对，因为到那时我们都年纪不小了。所以我们可能已经
[00:29:40.350] like nothing else to do. Might as well go to the reunion.
[00:29:40.350] 好像也没什么事可做，不如去参加同学聚会吧。
[00:29:43.350] I think like once my kids are in college, like I'll go to all the reunions.
[00:29:43.350] 我想等我的孩子们上了大学，我就会去参加所有的同学聚会。
[00:29:50.130] Actually, someone came to our reunion and she was pregnant. And I was like, wow, like,
[00:29:50.130] 实际上，有人来参加我们的同学聚会，她怀孕了。我当时就想，哇，真是……
[00:29:54.350] thank you so much for coming. Even though you're pregnant, it's really nice to reconnect and see
[00:29:54.350] 非常感谢你的到来。即使你怀孕了，能再次见到你真的很高兴。
[00:29:58.990] them. And it's kind of touching just to know like, oh, maybe our class does hold a special
[00:29:58.990] 他们。知道也许我们班确实有特殊的意义，这真的挺让人感动的。
[00:30:04.090] place in a lot of people's hearts, whether or not they admit it.
[00:30:04.090] 无论人们是否承认，它在很多人心中都占有一席之地。
[00:30:08.070] Yeah, yeah. Wait, I totally just remembered someone brought a yearbook.
[00:30:08.070] 是啊，是啊。等等，我突然想起来有人带了年鉴。
[00:30:13.150] Oh, that's right.
[00:30:13.150] 哦，对。
[00:30:13.750] And I remember people were like huddling around it, like flipping their pages and stuff. I was like,
[00:30:13.750] 我记得当时大家都围着那本书，翻来覆去地看。我就想，
[00:30:17.430] this is so fucking cute.
[00:30:17.430] 这也太可爱了吧。
[00:30:18.690] Yeah. That's funny. I totally should have brought one. I'm literally from yearbook too.
[00:30:18.690] 是啊，真巧。我真应该带一本的。我也是年鉴社的。
[00:30:25.190] But once we got there, then I was like, oh, I should have brought a yearbook for everyone.
[00:30:25.190] 但到了那里之后，我就想，哦，我应该给每个人都带一本年鉴。
[00:30:30.090] Well, all in all, I thought it was very, very special and nice to attend your guys' high school
[00:30:30.090] 总之，我觉得参观你们的高中非常非常特别和愉快。
[00:30:35.070] reunion. Even though I'm not attending mine, I am excited for my friends to go and fill me in
[00:30:35.070] 同学聚会。虽然我本人不参加，但我很期待朋友们去之后跟我分享他们的感受。
[00:30:41.450] afterwards. Thanks for attending, Jisoo. I know I kind of forced you to.
[00:30:41.450] 之后。谢谢你来，智秀。我知道我有点强迫你来的。
[00:30:46.630] A mandatory attending.
