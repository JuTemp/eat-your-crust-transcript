[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是克里斯托。
[00:00:03.360] And I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:03.360] 我是 Jeesoo。
[00:00:15.000] I have a slang word for us to talk about today.
[00:00:15.000] 今天我要和大家聊聊一个俚语。
[00:00:18.060] And I think it's an interesting one to discuss, mainly just because it's truly a testament of slang evolving with us because of the world that we live in.
[00:00:18.060] 我认为这是一个值得探讨的有趣话题，主要是因为它真实地证明了俚语会随着我们所处的世界而不断演变。
[00:00:30.540] It'll make sense when I explain it further.
[00:00:30.540] 我进一步解释之后你就明白了。
[00:00:33.700] But I feel like we all kind of know the phrase caught red-handed.
[00:00:33.700] 但我感觉我们都差不多知道“当场被抓”这个说法。
[00:00:37.760] And so this slang phrase is the evolution of that.
[00:00:37.760] 因此，这个俚语就是由此演变而来。
[00:00:42.700] So the evolved version is now caught in 4K.
[00:00:42.700] 所以，进化后的版本现在是以 4K 分辨率拍摄的。
[00:00:46.660] And it truly kind of shows because there's just so much like video content, streamers, you know, things that get uploaded to YouTube or whatever.
[00:00:46.660] 这一点确实很明显，因为现在有太多的视频内容，比如直播，你知道，还有上传到 YouTube 或其他平台上的内容。
[00:00:57.940] And so whenever people do something like stupid or silly, the easy comment is to be like, wow, I can't believe we just caught this on 4K.
[00:00:57.940] 所以每当人们做了些愚蠢或傻事时，人们很容易评论说：“哇，真不敢相信我们竟然用 4K 拍到了这一幕。”
[00:01:06.260] There's a bunch of variations of it, too.
[00:01:06.260] 它还有许多变体。
[00:01:08.560] I think you mentioned biting the curb in 4K.
[00:01:08.560] 我想你之前提到过在 4K 分辨率下被车撞到路沿石。
[00:01:11.360] So it's all along the similar lines of catching someone doing something silly or stupid, quote unquote, in 4K.
[00:01:11.360] 所以，这和用 4K 分辨率捕捉某人做傻事或蠢事的画面是类似的。
[00:01:19.540] I guess it's supposed to kind of emulate like a Google search where you might be looking for a video, but in super high definition.
[00:01:19.540] 我猜它的作用大概是模拟谷歌搜索，让你在搜索视频时，能够以超高清格式观看。
[00:01:27.360] So if I were looking for a music video, I might type in so-and-so's music video in 4K or something.
[00:01:27.360] 所以如果我在找音乐视频，我可能会输入“某某的 4K 音乐视频”之类的关键词。
[00:01:34.020] So I think biting the curb in 4K is actually like a form of a hate comment where you would put a celebrity's name that you hate before biting the curb in 4K.
[00:01:34.020] 所以我觉得用 4K 分辨率把某人“咬”在路边，实际上就像是一种仇恨评论，你会在用 4K 分辨率把某人“咬”在路边之前，先写上你讨厌的某个名人的名字。
[00:01:44.260] So, for example, I could be like Logan Paul biting the curb in 4K as a comment under a video where Logan Paul is doing something stupid.
[00:01:44.260] 例如，我可以在一段 Logan Paul 做蠢事的视频下评论说“Logan Paul 以 4K 分辨率咬路沿石”。
[00:01:51.500] Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that subreddit livestream fail.
[00:01:51.500] 是啊，这让我想起了那个Reddit子版块的直播失败事件。
[00:01:55.980] It's just like clips of streamers when they like end up doing something stupid online and getting clipped or if they like accidentally leak something.
[00:01:55.980] 就像主播们在网上做了什么蠢事被剪辑下来，或者不小心泄露了什么东西一样。
[00:02:05.320] Sometimes it's even wholesome stuff.
[00:02:05.320] 有时候甚至是一些有益身心的东西。
[00:02:07.040] But yeah, I think a lot of times the comments just end up being an echo chamber of like, oh, caught in 4K or like biting the curb or like whatever.
[00:02:07.040] 但是，我觉得很多时候评论最终都变成了回音室，比如“哦，被4K拍到了”或者“被路沿石砸到了”之类的。
[00:02:14.980] Yeah, failing in 4K basically, which is just crazy, actually, because I'm sure most people are familiar with the phrase biting the curb or curb stomping.
[00:02:14.980] 是的，基本上在 4K 分辨率下失败了，这简直太疯狂了，因为我相信大多数人都熟悉“被淘汰”或“被淘汰”这种说法。
[00:02:25.580] But it's a very violent thing to describe for anyone who doesn't know is essentially just imagine someone biting the curb and then bad things happening to that person while they're in that position, I guess.
[00:02:25.580] 但要向不了解情况的人描述这件事非常暴力，基本上就是想象有人咬住路沿石，然后这个人在这个位置上发生一些不好的事情，我想。
[00:02:39.540] I don't want to get too gruesome on this.
[00:02:39.540] 我不想把事情描述得太血腥。
[00:02:41.320] But yeah, it's like sort of a crazy hate comment to leave.
[00:02:41.320] 但确实，这种评论有点像是莫名其妙的仇恨言论。
[00:02:43.900] I feel like back then our hate comments were like kind of more innocent and like wholesome.
[00:02:43.900] 我觉得那时候我们那些充满恶意和仇恨的评论反而更纯真、更无害一些。
[00:02:48.400] Yeah, hate comments are pretty crazy online now.
[00:02:48.400] 是啊，现在网上的仇恨评论真是太疯狂了。
[00:02:52.740] Right.
[00:02:52.740] 正确的。
[00:02:53.400] But is the next evolution of this going to be like Logan Paul biting the curb in VR?
[00:02:53.400] 但下一步的发展会不会像洛根·保罗在虚拟现实中被人摔下车那样呢？
[00:02:59.400] Dude, oh my god.
[00:02:59.400] 我的天哪。
[00:03:01.280] Like that would be so funny.
[00:03:01.280] 那也太搞笑了。
[00:03:03.280] In 60.
[00:03:03.280] 60.
[00:03:04.940] Yeah.
[00:03:04.940] 是的。
[00:03:06.100] Honestly, probably.
[00:03:06.100] 说实话，很有可能。
[00:03:08.000] Wait, I could totally see it being like in 3D.
[00:03:08.000] 等等，我完全可以想象它会是3D的。
[00:03:11.040] Yeah, 3D or VR.
[00:03:11.040] 对，3D 或 VR。
[00:03:12.480] Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:12.480] 对，没错。
[00:03:13.900] In the metaverse.
[00:03:13.900] 在元宇宙中。
[00:03:15.540] Yeah.
[00:03:15.540] 是的。
[00:03:16.540] All right.
[00:03:16.540] 好的。
[00:03:17.520] Well, slang words aside, our topic today is just about feeling like an adult and talking about our general adulting lives.
[00:03:17.520] 好了，先不说俚语，我们今天的话题是关于如何感觉自己像个成年人，以及我们成年人的日常生活。
[00:03:28.560] It's been a few years as adults, I want to say.
[00:03:28.560] 我想说，我们成年已经好几年了。
[00:03:31.820] And like hopefully we have a better grasp on some things, but evidently not all things.
[00:03:31.820] 希望我们对某些事情有了更深入的了解，但显然并非所有事情都能如此。
[00:03:37.540] Kind of in the beginning of the year or maybe it was like the end of last year, I mentioned how sometimes things still make me feel really young or like a kid.
[00:03:37.540] 大概是今年年初，或者可能是去年年底，我提到过，有时候某些事情仍然会让我感觉自己很年轻，像个孩子。
[00:03:47.440] So we thought now we could reflect on if that has changed and if there are more things now that make us feel like adults.
[00:03:47.440] 所以我们现在想，或许可以反思一下这种情况是否有所改变，以及现在是否有更多事情让我们觉得自己像个大人了。
[00:03:56.820] Yeah, I feel like often on this podcast, we're constantly having a crisis about not feeling our age.
[00:03:56.820] 是的，我觉得在这个播客节目里，我们经常会纠结于自己感觉不到自己有多老。
[00:04:03.800] Yeah.
[00:04:03.800] 是的。
[00:04:04.160] And being in your late 20s, we are kind of like seasoned adults now.
[00:04:04.160] 我们都快三十岁了，感觉自己都像是经验丰富的大人了。
[00:04:07.000] Mm-hmm.
[00:04:07.000] 嗯。
[00:04:07.860] And recently I did have a moment where I felt very adult, which is eating fruit.
[00:04:07.860] 最近我确实有那么一刻感觉自己很成熟，那就是吃水果。
[00:04:14.520] I think a big part of Asian culture, you grow up eating a lot of fruit anyways.
[00:04:14.520] 我认为这是亚洲文化的重要组成部分，因为人们从小就吃很多水果。
[00:04:18.580] Mm-hmm.
[00:04:18.580] 嗯。
[00:04:18.820] I feel like a lot of Asian parents love fruit, so then inevitably it kind of trickles down to you and your preferences.
[00:04:18.820] 我觉得很多亚洲父母都喜欢水果，所以这种喜好不可避免地会传递给你。
[00:04:25.060] But it had been a few years since I've lived with my parents, so I wasn't really getting my fruit intake on the daily basis.
[00:04:25.060] 但我离开父母家已经好几年了，所以我每天都无法摄入足够的水果。
[00:04:31.200] And if anyone knows me in real life, you know I'm like a huge candy person.
[00:04:31.200] 如果有人在现实生活中认识我，就会知道我超级爱吃甜食。
[00:04:35.580] So I feel like all this time, starting college, my fruit substitute was candy.
[00:04:35.580] 所以我觉得从上大学开始，这么多年来，我的水果替代品一直是糖果。
[00:04:42.580] Mm-hmm.
[00:04:42.580] 嗯。
[00:04:43.660] But a couple times this year, I've had some fruit experiences where I was like, holy shit, is fruit better than candy?
[00:04:43.660] 但今年有几次，我吃水果的时候都觉得，我的天哪，水果比糖果好吃吗？
[00:04:50.620] And no one told me this entire time.
[00:04:50.620] 一直以来竟然没有人告诉我这件事。
[00:04:53.960] Dude, fruit is just the adult version of candy.
[00:04:53.960] 老兄，水果只不过是成人版的糖果而已。
[00:04:56.520] No, it literally is.
[00:04:56.520] 不，确实如此。
[00:04:57.940] And I had this mango the other day that was so expensive.
[00:04:57.940] 前几天我买了一个特别贵的芒果。
[00:05:02.840] I think it was like $7 or something from this one tiny market at a mall nearby us.
[00:05:02.840] 我记得好像是在我们附近商场里一家小超市买的，价格是7美元左右。
[00:05:09.060] When I was buying it, I was like, damn, I really like mangoes, but this is really expensive.
[00:05:09.060] 我买的时候就想，天哪，我真的很喜欢芒果，但这芒果也太贵了吧。
[00:05:12.760] But maybe it's expensive because it's good.
[00:05:12.760] 但也许它贵是因为它好。
[00:05:14.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:05:14.720] 嗯。
[00:05:15.080] And then I ate it and I literally, it like blew my mind.
[00:05:15.080] 然后我吃了它，真的，它简直让我惊艳。
[00:05:18.180] Oh, my God.
[00:05:18.180] 我的天啊。
[00:05:18.240] Like my eyes were rolling back into my head.
[00:05:18.240] 感觉我的眼珠都要翻到后脑勺去了。
[00:05:20.320] I was just like so impressed by this fruit.
[00:05:20.320] 我真的被这种水果惊艳到了。
[00:05:25.020] And then since then, I feel like I've just been craving candy significantly less.
[00:05:25.020] 从那以后，我觉得我对糖果的渴望明显减少了。
[00:05:29.000] Oh, wow.
[00:05:29.000] 哦，哇。
[00:05:29.900] That's so good.
[00:05:29.900] 太好了。
[00:05:31.760] Dude, that just reminds me though.
[00:05:31.760] 兄弟，这倒是让我想起一件事。
[00:05:33.480] Do you ever watch Bretman Rock on TikTok?
[00:05:33.480] 你有没有在TikTok上看过Bretman Rock的视频？
[00:05:35.640] Oh, my God.
[00:05:35.640] 我的天啊。
[00:05:36.160] Yes.
[00:05:36.160] 是的。
[00:05:36.400] When he eats his fruit, oh, my God.
[00:05:36.400] 当他吃水果的时候，我的天哪。
[00:05:39.440] I'm like, that is the life I want to be living.
[00:05:39.440] 我心想，这就是我想要的生活。
[00:05:41.600] Just picking the ripest, freshest fruit just out of his backyard.
[00:05:41.600] 就从自家后院摘最成熟、最新鲜的水果。
[00:05:45.880] He's growing it himself.
[00:05:45.880] 他自己种的。
[00:05:47.260] And it looks so good when he eats it.
[00:05:47.260] 他吃的时候看起来真好吃。
[00:05:49.600] That's what I'm imagining happened to you when you ate that mango.
[00:05:49.600] 我猜你吃芒果的时候就是这种情况。
[00:05:53.960] Yeah, pretty much.
[00:05:53.960] 是的，差不多。
[00:05:55.140] I got some pretty good ROI from my $7 mango.
[00:05:55.140] 我花7美元买的芒果获得了相当不错的投资回报率。
[00:05:59.380] Yeah.
[00:05:59.380] 是的。
[00:06:00.740] Yeah.
[00:06:00.740] 是的。
[00:06:01.160] Was it like one of the greenish reddish ones or was it like a yellow golden one?
[00:06:01.160] 是那种带点绿红色的，还是那种带点金黄色的？
[00:06:06.720] It was greenish reddish.
[00:06:06.720] 它呈绿红色。
[00:06:08.620] But what was interesting about this one and what made me buy it even despite the price tag
[00:06:08.620] 但这款产品最吸引我的地方是什么？是什么让我即使价格不菲也依然购买了它？
[00:06:12.600] was it said it was fiberless.
[00:06:12.600] 据说它是无纤维的。
[00:06:14.460] Oh.
[00:06:14.460] 哦。
[00:06:14.780] And it was also imported from I can't remember which country, but somewhere definitely more
[00:06:14.780] 而且它还是从某个我记不清的国家进口的，但肯定比
[00:06:19.340] tropical than California.
[00:06:19.340] 比加利福尼亚更热带。
[00:06:21.400] And I love mangoes, but I do dislike the fibers a little bit.
[00:06:21.400] 我喜欢芒果，但我有点不喜欢它的纤维。
[00:06:25.460] I feel like sometimes it takes away from the experience.
[00:06:25.460] 我觉得有时候这会影响体验。
[00:06:27.220] So I was so curious when I bought it and it did, in fact, have less fibers.
[00:06:27.220] 所以我买的时候非常好奇，结果发现它确实纤维含量比较少。
[00:06:31.620] Oh, my God.
[00:06:31.620] 我的天啊。
[00:06:31.960] And it was very sweet.
[00:06:31.960] 非常甜蜜。
[00:06:32.860] Then was it like creamy?
[00:06:32.860] 那它口感像奶油一样吗？
[00:06:34.920] Like what was the texture then?
[00:06:34.920] 当时的质地是什么样的？
[00:06:36.960] Yeah, it was creamy, really, really juicy.
[00:06:36.960] 是的，口感很顺滑，而且非常多汁。
[00:06:40.380] And it kind of just tasted like I was eating custard almost, but not quite as like gelatinous.
[00:06:40.380] 吃起来有点像在吃蛋奶冻，但又不像果冻那么黏稠。
[00:06:47.680] Right.
[00:06:47.680] 正确的。
[00:06:47.940] Just like such a smooth eating experience.
[00:06:47.940] 就像一种非常顺滑的进食体验。
[00:06:51.600] Wait, that sounds so good.
[00:06:51.600] 等等，听起来真不错。
[00:06:53.440] Yeah, dude.
[00:06:53.440] 是啊，兄弟。
[00:06:54.520] I mean, if it's good enough to convert me out of my candy addiction, I feel like it was pretty
[00:06:54.520] 我的意思是，如果它好到能让我戒掉吃糖的瘾，我觉得它就相当不错了。
[00:06:58.940] fucking good.
[00:06:58.940] 真他妈好。
[00:07:00.180] I have also heard that if you want usually more high quality fruits and veggies,
[00:07:00.180] 我还听说，如果你想要更多高质量的水果和蔬菜，
[00:07:06.360] it's definitely worth it to check out your local farmer's market.
[00:07:06.360] 绝对值得去逛逛当地的农贸市场。
[00:07:10.400] Usually they'll have maybe even some produce that isn't even sold in stores, a variety of
[00:07:10.400] 通常他们甚至会有一些商店里都买不到的农产品，种类繁多。
[00:07:16.280] certain vegetables or fruits.
[00:07:16.280] 某些蔬菜或水果。
[00:07:18.280] So I feel like that's kind of a goal of mine right now.
[00:07:18.280] 所以我觉得这算是我现在的一个目标吧。
[00:07:21.340] And I feel like that's also a very like adulty thing to do.
[00:07:21.340] 我觉得这也是成年人会做的事。
[00:07:25.220] Oh, my God.
[00:07:25.220] 我的天啊。
[00:07:25.880] It totally is going to the farmer's market with like a basket in your arms or something.
[00:07:25.880] 这完全就是抱着篮子去农贸市场之类的。
[00:07:32.140] Exactly.
[00:07:32.140] 确切地。
[00:07:32.680] And also because farmer's markets usually happen earlier, right?
[00:07:32.680] 而且农贸市场通常开得比较早，对吧？
[00:07:37.180] Like in the mornings.
[00:07:37.180] 就像早上那样。
[00:07:38.420] Right.
[00:07:38.420] 正确的。
[00:07:38.860] And you especially want to go early to get there before everything sells out.
[00:07:38.860] 而且你最好早点去，以免东西售罄。
[00:07:42.940] And I'm not a huge morning person.
[00:07:42.940] 而且我不太喜欢早起。
[00:07:44.840] So, you know, I'm like, damn, if I were to wake up specifically just to go to a farmer's
[00:07:44.840] 所以，你知道，我就想，天哪，如果我特意醒来就是为了去一个农民那里……
[00:07:49.840] market, that is true adulting.
[00:07:49.840] 市场，那才是真正的成人世界。
[00:07:52.240] You're like, this is why this is still a goal.
[00:07:52.240] 你会想，这就是为什么这仍然是一个目标。
[00:07:54.380] Yeah.
[00:07:54.380] 是的。
[00:07:56.020] But honestly, yeah.
[00:07:56.020] 但说实话，是的。
[00:07:57.420] Waking up early to do something that's not hedonistic is so adult, I feel, because going
[00:07:57.420] 我觉得早起去做一些非享乐主义的事情才显得成熟，因为去
[00:08:03.260] to a farmer's market is not an obligation necessarily.
[00:08:03.260] 去农贸市场并非必然是义务。
[00:08:06.480] And it's not just pure pleasure.
[00:08:06.480] 而且这不仅仅是纯粹的快乐。
[00:08:08.860] You know, it's just like something that's kind of cool and like benefits you.
[00:08:08.860] 你知道，这就像是某种很酷而且对你有好处的东西。
[00:08:12.640] So I feel like every time I've woken up early and like gone to the gym or even something like
[00:08:12.640] 所以我觉得每次我早起去健身房或者做其他类似的事情之后，
[00:08:17.200] go to golf, I'm always just like, wow, I'm an adult.
[00:08:17.200] 每次去打高尔夫，我都会想，哇，我真是个大人了。
[00:08:20.160] Like I'm waking up early for something that's not work or like a social obligation.
[00:08:20.160] 感觉就像我早起是为了做一些既不是工作也不是社交活动的事情。
[00:08:24.340] So true.
[00:08:24.340] 如此真实。
[00:08:25.120] I don't know why, but I guess sleeping in just feels like a thing for younger people and waking
[00:08:25.120] 我不知道为什么，但我觉得睡懒觉好像是年轻人的专属，而醒来
[00:08:32.240] up early.
[00:08:32.240] 早起。
[00:08:32.900] I don't know.
[00:08:32.900] 我不知道。
[00:08:33.720] It almost feels like a mature thing to do.
[00:08:33.720] 这感觉就像是一件成熟的事情。
[00:08:37.240] But honestly, I feel like it is.
[00:08:37.240] 但说实话，我觉得确实如此。
[00:08:40.080] This past week, my husband and I had had kind of busier work schedules a little bit.
[00:08:40.080] 过去一周，我和我丈夫的工作安排都比较忙。
[00:08:45.680] So we've been trying to go to bed by 10.
[00:08:45.680] 所以我们一直尽量在晚上十点前睡觉。
[00:08:49.620] Wow.
[00:08:49.620] 哇。
[00:08:50.160] And every time I lay there and it's like you go into bed by 10, watch some stuff.
[00:08:50.160] 每次我躺在那里，就像你晚上十点就上床睡觉，看看电视之类的东西一样。
[00:08:54.520] And then by 1030, you're like starting to put your phone away.
[00:08:54.520] 到了10点30分，你大概就会开始把手机收起来了。
[00:08:56.820] I'm always like, wow, I'm like 80 years old.
[00:08:56.820] 我总是会想，哇，我都80岁了。
[00:09:02.740] Oh, my God.
[00:09:02.740] 我的天啊。
[00:09:04.280] Dude, I could never.
[00:09:04.280] 老兄，我绝对做不到。
[00:09:08.380] I just like I can't.
[00:09:08.380] 我就是做不到。
[00:09:10.400] Waking up is just mostly only for responsibilities work or.
[00:09:10.400] 醒来大多只是为了履行工作职责。
[00:09:15.320] Okay.
[00:09:15.320] 好的。
[00:09:15.960] I will say I sometimes wake up early for like golf or something of that sort.
[00:09:15.960] 我得说，我有时会早起，比如去打高尔夫球或者做类似的事情。
[00:09:20.780] But still, it just feels like such an adult thing to do.
[00:09:20.780] 但即便如此，这仍然感觉像是成年人才会做的事。
[00:09:24.020] It's like, oh, I have responsibility and that's why I'm waking up early.
[00:09:24.020] 感觉就像，哦，我肩负着责任，所以我才早起。
[00:09:27.540] Or maybe it's even like I chose to have responsibility and that's why I'm waking up early.
[00:09:27.540] 或许是因为我选择承担责任，所以才早起。
[00:09:31.940] And maybe that's the real adult part about it.
[00:09:31.940] 也许这才是它真正成人化的一面。
[00:09:34.880] That you like choose to have a certain responsibility that you're following through with.
[00:09:34.880] 你喜欢选择承担某种责任，并且你会认真履行这种责任。
[00:09:39.460] Damn.
[00:09:39.460] 该死。
[00:09:40.220] Yeah.
[00:09:40.220] 是的。
[00:09:40.420] It's like doing stuff not just because you want to do it, but because you should.
[00:09:40.420] 这就像做某事不仅仅是因为你想做，而是因为你应该做。
[00:09:45.000] Yeah.
[00:09:45.000] 是的。
[00:09:45.600] And speaking of, I think when I plan my weekend sometimes and it's just like a bunch of errands,
[00:09:45.600] 说到这儿，我觉得有时候我计划周末的时候，结果就是一堆琐事要办，
[00:09:51.040] that also makes me feel kind of adulty.
[00:09:51.040] 这让我感觉自己有点像个大人了。
[00:09:53.620] Ooh.
[00:09:53.620] 哦。
[00:09:54.140] Wait, can I tell you a moment where I felt like you were such an adult?
[00:09:54.140] 等等，我可以跟你说说我感觉你像个大人的那一刻吗？
[00:09:58.020] Oh, my God.
[00:09:58.020] 我的天啊。
[00:09:58.580] Okay.
[00:09:58.580] 好的。
[00:09:59.640] It must have been a couple of weeks ago, but some of our friends came over to your place
[00:09:59.640] 大概是两周前吧，我们的一些朋友来你家玩了。
[00:10:04.680] to binge watch the Twilight movies.
[00:10:04.680] 一口气看完《暮光之城》系列电影。
[00:10:06.500] Yeah.
[00:10:06.500] 是的。
[00:10:07.600] I think when we came in, you had like some sort of contraption in your hands.
[00:10:07.600] 我想我们进来的时候，你手里拿着某种装置。
[00:10:11.880] And I was like, oh, what are you holding?
[00:10:11.880] 我当时就想，哦，你手里拿着什么？
[00:10:14.320] And you were like, oh, just I just need to like weatherproof the door or something like that.
[00:10:14.320] 然后你就说，哦，我只需要给门做个防风雨处理之类的。
[00:10:18.520] And I was like, oh, holy shit.
[00:10:18.520] 我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:10:20.560] I've never even heard that phrase ever in my entire life.
[00:10:20.560] 我这辈子都没听过这句话。
[00:10:23.640] And I just thought you were such an adult in that moment.
[00:10:23.640] 那一刻，我觉得你真是个成熟的大人。
[00:10:26.800] Oh, my God.
[00:10:26.800] 我的天啊。
[00:10:27.760] Wait, I don't even remember that.
[00:10:27.760] 等等，我根本不记得这件事了。
[00:10:30.460] Oh, my God.
[00:10:30.460] 我的天啊。
[00:10:31.260] That's so funny.
[00:10:31.260] 太搞笑了。
[00:10:32.200] That sounds like me, I think.
[00:10:32.200] 我觉得这很像我。
[00:10:34.020] I really like doing home projects, I guess.
[00:10:34.020] 我真的很喜欢做家居改造项目。
[00:10:37.600] So it's a little different right now because I'm like renting.
[00:10:37.600] 所以现在情况有点不一样，因为我是租房住。
[00:10:40.600] I can't go crazy.
[00:10:40.600] 我不能发疯。
[00:10:42.380] But like if I could, I would do so much.
[00:10:42.380] 但如果可以的话，我真想做很多事。
[00:10:45.920] You're right.
[00:10:45.920] 你说得对。
[00:10:46.700] That does feel very responsible and just like things that we would have never thought about
[00:10:46.700] 这确实让人感觉责任重大，而且正是我们从未想过的事情。
[00:10:52.560] when we were younger.
[00:10:52.560] 当我们年轻的时候。
[00:10:53.940] Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:53.940] 对，没错。
[00:10:54.980] I was shook because I feel like when you're young, the chores, you know, are like sweeping,
[00:10:54.980] 我当时很震惊，因为我觉得年轻的时候，家务活，你知道，就像扫地一样。
[00:10:59.800] like raking leaves, wiping surfaces, like very elementary, fundamental things or like ways
[00:10:59.800] 就像耙树叶、擦拭表面一样，就像一些非常基础、基本的事情或类似的方式。
[00:11:06.900] to clean it up, keep the house.
[00:11:06.900] 打扫干净，保持房屋整洁。
[00:11:08.460] I feel like the older we get, it's like you see more things that need to be done around
[00:11:08.460] 我觉得年纪越大，就越会发现周围需要做的事情越来越多。
[00:11:12.720] the home.
[00:11:12.720] 家。
[00:11:13.460] So to me, the fact that you even knew what weather stripping was just like opened up
[00:11:13.460] 所以对我来说，你居然知道什么是密封条，这本身就说明了很多问题。
[00:11:17.860] a new world for me.
[00:11:17.860] 对我来说，这是一个全新的世界。
[00:11:18.820] And I was like, oh, I also need to do that.
[00:11:18.820] 我当时就想，哦，我也需要这样做。
[00:11:24.280] Thank you for putting a term to the thing that I felt like we needed to do.
[00:11:24.280] 谢谢你帮我把我觉得我们必须要做的事情用一个词概括出来。
[00:11:29.480] Although I will admit, I think owning your own space, you know, whether it's a rental
[00:11:29.480] 虽然我承认，我觉得拥有自己的空间，不管是租的还是买的，都挺好的。
[00:11:34.320] or truly owning it or whatever, but like having ownership of your own space does feel much
[00:11:34.320] 或者说真正拥有它之类的，但就像拥有自己的空间一样，感觉确实很棒。
[00:11:41.540] more filled with responsibility or just adulty.
[00:11:41.540] 更有责任感，或者说更成熟。
[00:11:45.780] How many times will we say adult this episode?
[00:11:45.780] 本期节目中我们会说多少次“成人”这个词？
[00:11:49.580] But I think it's different because like when you're with a platonic roommate, it's much
[00:11:49.580] 但我认为这不一样，因为当你和一位柏拉图式的室友在一起时，情况就大不相同了。
[00:11:54.860] more almost college feeling.
[00:11:54.860] 更有大学氛围了。
[00:11:57.060] You still feel pretty young.
[00:11:57.060] 你感觉自己仍然很年轻。
[00:11:58.860] You know, you have to share space.
[00:11:58.860] 你知道，空间是要共享的。
[00:12:00.560] So it doesn't quite feel like it's hard to describe, but it just doesn't feel to the
[00:12:00.560] 所以感觉上并不难描述，但就是感觉不太对劲。
[00:12:05.980] level of like you get to take control of this entire space.
[00:12:05.980] 感觉自己可以完全掌控这个空间。
[00:12:10.760] Hmm.
[00:12:10.760] 唔。
[00:12:11.760] And I think you're right about like the sense of ownership that comes with it being purely
[00:12:11.760] 我认为你说得对，那种所有权感是纯粹的……
[00:12:15.720] like your space.
[00:12:15.720] 喜欢你的空间。
[00:12:17.400] An easy example that comes to mind is I feel like when I was younger, I would be like, oh,
[00:12:17.400] 我能想到的一个简单的例子是，我觉得我年轻的时候会想，哦，
[00:12:21.720] we should throw a party.
[00:12:21.720] 我们应该办个派对。
[00:12:22.760] Like it would be so much fun.
[00:12:22.760] 感觉会非常有趣。
[00:12:24.400] And I would just think about the fun part.
[00:12:24.400] 我只会想着有趣的部分。
[00:12:26.720] But the older I get, the space aspect is more important, you know?
[00:12:26.720] 但是年纪越大，太空方面就越重要，你知道吗？
[00:12:30.100] So then now if I'm thinking about throwing a party, I'm like, damn, that's a lot of cleanup.
[00:12:30.100] 所以现在如果我考虑举办派对，我就会想，天哪，那得清理多少东西啊。
[00:12:33.800] That's a lot of prep.
[00:12:33.800] 这需要做很多准备工作。
[00:12:34.760] Like that's like all this work that comes with it instead of just thinking about the joy that
[00:12:34.760] 就好像除了想到快乐之外，还要考虑随之而来的所有工作一样。
[00:12:39.480] comes out of it.
[00:12:39.480] 从中走出来。
[00:12:40.660] Ooh, so true.
[00:12:40.660] 哦，说得太对了。
[00:12:41.980] I think back in, you know, college or even before that, inviting people over, it's like
[00:12:41.980] 我回想起大学时代，甚至更早的时候，邀请朋友来家里玩，感觉就像……
[00:12:48.440] not really your place.
[00:12:48.440] 这其实不关你的事。
[00:12:50.560] If it's your parents' place, you're not really cleaning it up.
[00:12:50.560] 如果那是你父母的房子，你其实并没有真的在打扫。
[00:12:54.040] If anything, your parents end up cleaning it up and you don't even realize.
[00:12:54.040] 最后，你的父母会帮你清理干净，而你甚至都没有察觉。
[00:12:58.240] Or like in college, you just invite people over and you don't think too much about it
[00:12:58.240] 或者就像在大学里一样，你只是邀请朋友来家里玩，不会想太多。
[00:13:01.840] because it's like, oh, well, everyone's dorm looks about the same.
[00:13:01.840] 因为感觉就像，哦，好吧，大家的宿舍看起来都差不多。
[00:13:05.000] But now it's like, oh my God, I want to like, you know, have everyone be really comfortable
[00:13:05.000] 但现在的感觉是，天哪，我希望，你知道，能让每个人都感到非常自在。
[00:13:09.880] when they're here or like leave a good impression.
[00:13:09.880] 他们在这里或喜欢的时候会给人留下好印象。
[00:13:12.520] Impress people with my artwork, all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:12.520] 用我的作品打动人心，诸如此类。
[00:13:16.540] With my floating shelves.
[00:13:16.540] 我的悬浮式置物架。
[00:13:18.120] Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:18.120] 对，没错。
[00:13:20.380] All my plants and like all my decor.
[00:13:20.380] 我所有的植物，还有我所有的装饰品。
[00:13:24.800] I need them to see my whole personality just when they step through the door.
[00:13:24.800] 我希望他们一进门就能看到我的全部个性。
[00:13:30.460] Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:30.460] 对，没错。
[00:13:31.480] And I think that makes you put a lot more of your like heart and soul into cleaning or
[00:13:31.480] 我认为这会让你更加全心全意地投入到清洁工作中。
[00:13:37.240] like decorating and whatnot.
[00:13:37.240] 比如装饰之类的。
[00:13:38.780] Instead of it feeling like just a space, it's like your place, right?
[00:13:38.780] 感觉不像是一个普通的空间，而像是你自己的家，对吧？
[00:13:43.800] It's like an extension of yourself.
[00:13:43.800] 它就像是你自身的延伸。
[00:13:45.880] Yeah.
[00:13:45.880] 是的。
[00:13:47.220] I feel like I really feel it too when sometimes our conversations with our friends literally
[00:13:47.220] 我觉得有时候和朋友的谈话真的也会让我有这种感觉。
[00:13:52.100] turn to like what kind of furniture we're looking for or what kind of furniture we like.
[00:13:52.100] 转而讨论我们正在寻找什么样的家具，或者我们喜欢什么样的家具。
[00:13:57.380] And then in that moment, we're all just like, oh my God, this is really what we've become.
[00:13:57.380] 那一刻，我们都恍然大悟，我的天哪，我们真的变成了这样。
[00:14:01.460] We get so excited over furniture.
[00:14:01.460] 我们对家具总是充满热情。
[00:14:04.560] Yeah, that's such a good point.
[00:14:04.560] 没错，你说得太对了。
[00:14:06.180] Like conversation topics are really evolving, huh?
[00:14:06.180] 看来聊天话题真的在不断变化啊！
[00:14:09.100] I think it's going to start to feel really weird when maybe some of us have kids, some
[00:14:09.100] 我觉得当我们中的一些人有了孩子之后，这种感觉会变得非常奇怪，有些人……
[00:14:13.840] of us don't.
[00:14:13.840] 我们当中有些人不这样做。
[00:14:15.160] But then like half of us are talking about like, oh, what preschool are you going to send your
[00:14:15.160] 但后来我们当中有一半人都在讨论，哦，你要把孩子送到哪家幼儿园？
[00:14:17.980] kid?
[00:14:17.980] 孩子？
[00:14:18.540] Oh my God.
[00:14:18.540] 我的天啊。
[00:14:19.000] And then the other half will maybe still be talking about the furniture aspect a little
[00:14:19.000] 然后另一半人可能还会继续讨论家具方面的问题。
[00:14:23.200] bit.
[00:14:23.200] 少量。
[00:14:23.760] Yeah.
[00:14:23.760] 是的。
[00:14:25.540] It was like that time we went on like a mini girls trip up to Napa at the first winery.
[00:14:25.540] 那次我们几个女生一起去纳帕谷的第一家酒庄，感觉就像是进行了一次小型旅行。
[00:14:30.880] We're just starting to settle in and drink a bit.
[00:14:30.880] 我们刚开始安顿下来，喝点东西。
[00:14:33.860] And we're all like, so thoughts on freezing eggs?
[00:14:33.860] 于是我们都想问：你们对冷冻卵子有什么看法？
[00:14:38.620] Oh my God, you're so right.
[00:14:38.620] 我的天哪，你说得太对了。
[00:14:41.540] We literally spent the entire time at that first winery talking about egg freezing.
[00:14:41.540] 我们在第一个酒庄的整个时间里都在谈论冷冻卵子的事情。
[00:14:47.300] Oh God, it's in full force.
[00:14:47.300] 我的天，它威力十足。
[00:14:50.440] We can't even stop it.
[00:14:50.440] 我们根本无法阻止它。
[00:14:52.600] But I mean, I think the benefit of this too, maybe now our brain is able to grasp bigger
[00:14:52.600] 但我的意思是，我认为这也有好处，或许现在我们的大脑能够理解更大的概念了。
[00:14:58.580] concepts and talk about these things that uses feel a lot more intimidating when we were
[00:14:58.580] 当我们还在学习相关概念和谈论这些事情时，会感觉更加令人生畏。
[00:15:03.880] younger, you know?
[00:15:03.880] 年轻点儿，你知道吗？
[00:15:04.960] Yeah.
[00:15:04.960] 是的。
[00:15:05.100] And it also means we have maybe some of the more financial means to be able to even consider
[00:15:05.100] 这也意味着我们或许拥有一些更充裕的经济能力来考虑这个问题。
[00:15:09.260] something like egg freezing.
[00:15:09.260] 比如冷冻卵子。
[00:15:10.520] So that's kind of cool.
[00:15:10.520] 这还挺酷的。
[00:15:11.960] Yeah.
[00:15:11.960] 是的。
[00:15:12.320] And I guess it's just like kind of inevitable too, right?
[00:15:12.320] 我觉得这好像也是不可避免的，对吧？
[00:15:15.240] That we're like getting to the age that these things are happening around us.
[00:15:15.240] 我们似乎已经到了会经历这些事情的年纪了。
[00:15:19.440] We're seeing it happen as well.
[00:15:19.440] 我们也看到了这种情况的发生。
[00:15:21.400] So I'm glad we're able to have open discussions about it with each other.
[00:15:21.400] 所以我很高兴我们能够就此进行公开讨论。
[00:15:25.780] Yeah.
[00:15:25.780] 是的。
[00:15:26.180] Yeah.
[00:15:26.180] 是的。
[00:15:26.420] We're kind of experiencing the same age together.
[00:15:26.420] 我们差不多一起经历着同样的年龄阶段。
[00:15:29.640] And that in itself is very special, even if we each experience it in a different way.
[00:15:29.640] 即使我们每个人体验到的方式不同，这本身也是一件非常特别的事情。
[00:15:34.360] Yeah.
[00:15:34.360] 是的。
[00:15:34.940] And we're not trying to shield ourselves or like hide from reality.
[00:15:34.940] 我们并不是想保护自己或者逃避现实。
[00:15:38.380] We're just like, so this is kind of the reality that's coming up on us.
[00:15:38.380] 我们当时就想，这就是我们即将面临的现实。
[00:15:42.020] Like, what are your thoughts?
[00:15:42.020] 你有什么想法？
[00:15:44.920] God.
[00:15:44.920] 上帝。
[00:15:45.360] God.
[00:15:45.360] 上帝。
[00:15:46.120] Although I will say that some of the other moments where I feel proud of my ability to
[00:15:46.120] 虽然我得说，在其他一些时刻，我也会为自己的能力感到自豪，
[00:15:52.820] be an adult is more simple and maybe like a little bit more lighthearted.
[00:15:52.820] 做个大人更简单，也可能更轻松一些。
[00:15:57.640] I was kind of thinking about this recently, but every time I go up to the fish counter
[00:15:57.640] 我最近一直在想这件事，但每次我去鱼柜台前的时候……
[00:16:03.160] at like a grocery store and I ask for salmon to like the fish guy instead of buying like frozen
[00:16:03.160] 我在超市里，像卖鱼的那种店，要三文鱼，而不是买冷冻的。我跟卖鱼的店员说要三文鱼，而不是买冷冻的。
[00:16:09.240] salmon filet, I'm like, holy shit, this is late twenties.
[00:16:09.240] 鲑鱼片，我心想，我的天，这都快三十岁了。
[00:16:14.200] Oh my God.
[00:16:14.200] 我的天啊。
[00:16:15.240] I actually had a similar experience recently where I was at, I think it was a 99 ranch
[00:16:15.240] 我最近也有过类似的经历，我记得当时我在一家叫99 Ranch的餐厅。
[00:16:20.380] or something.
[00:16:20.380] 或者别的什么。
[00:16:21.120] And I noticed that the stores, their own cut up ground pork was cheaper than the like
[00:16:21.120] 我注意到，这些商店自家切好的猪肉馅比其他同类产品便宜。
[00:16:27.120] pre-packaged one.
[00:16:27.120] 预包装的。
[00:16:28.640] And I had a moment where I was, I just stared at them for a second and I was like,
[00:16:28.640] 我当时愣住了，盯着他们看了一会儿，然后心想：
[00:16:32.800] no, I have to buy the cheaper one.
[00:16:32.800] 不，我得买便宜的那款。
[00:16:34.880] So I forced myself to talk to the butcher guy and I was like, can I get a pound of this?
[00:16:34.880] 于是我强迫自己和屠夫说话，我说：“我能买一磅这个吗？”
[00:16:42.780] I think they're always so nice too, but yeah, I have to like muster up all the courage inside
[00:16:42.780] 我觉得他们也总是那么好，但是，是啊，我得鼓起勇气才能鼓起勇气。
[00:16:47.000] me and be like, give me a pound of that.
[00:16:47.000] 然后我会说，给我一磅那个。
[00:16:49.360] And dude, I had the same feeling as you.
[00:16:49.360] 兄弟，我和你的感觉一样。
[00:16:51.660] I was like, wow, this is like adulthood.
[00:16:51.660] 我当时想，哇，这就像成年生活一样。
[00:16:53.860] This is like stuff my parents would not be afraid to do.
[00:16:53.860] 这就像我父母会毫不犹豫去做的事情。
[00:16:57.000] I know.
[00:16:57.000] 我知道。
[00:16:57.740] Oh, and I feel like the next step up is like, if you're buying steak or like fish, for example,
[00:16:57.740] 哦，我觉得更进一步的选项是，比如，如果你要买牛排或者鱼之类的，
[00:17:05.240] if you're brave enough to be like, can I get that filet instead of that other one?
[00:17:05.240] 如果你够勇敢，就可以问：“我能把那块菲力牛排换成另一块吗？”
[00:17:09.500] Like that's true adulthood.
[00:17:09.500] 那才叫真正的成年。
[00:17:14.100] What was also funny in the moment was I was fully ready to speak Chinese to this guy.
[00:17:14.100] 当时最搞笑的是，我完全准备好要用中文和这个人交流了。
[00:17:20.040] I was like, oh shit, how do you say ground pork in Chinese?
[00:17:20.040] 我当时就想，糟了，中文里“肉末”怎么说？
[00:17:23.320] And then I was like, okay, worst case, I'll just point and be like that one in Chinese.
[00:17:23.320] 然后我就想，好吧，最坏的情况，我就指着那个东西，用中文说“就是这样”。
[00:17:27.560] One pound.
[00:17:27.560] 一磅。
[00:17:28.340] But then the person who came up was fully not Chinese.
[00:17:28.340] 但走上来的人却完全不是中国人。
[00:17:33.760] You're like, oh, thank God.
[00:17:33.760] 你会想，哦，感谢上帝。
[00:17:35.300] Can I get a pound of that?
[00:17:35.300] 我可以要一磅吗？
[00:17:39.340] Oh man.
[00:17:39.340] 我的天哪。
[00:17:40.840] The other crazy part of that too is I guess for something like steak or fish filets, you're
[00:17:40.840] 另一件令人匪夷所思的事是，我想对于牛排或鱼片之类的食物来说，你……
[00:17:48.400] not really asking for a pound of something.
[00:17:48.400] 其实我并不是真的想要一磅东西。
[00:17:51.400] But for something like ground pork or maybe like bigger slabs of meat, you do kind of want
[00:17:51.400] 但对于像猪肉馅或者大块的肉来说，你确实会想要……
[00:17:55.420] to know how many pounds of something that you're getting, right?
[00:17:55.420] 你想知道你买到了多少磅的东西，对吧？
[00:17:57.980] I feel like being able to visualize and like just visually understand what a pound of something
[00:17:57.980] 我觉得能够形象地、直观地理解一磅东西到底是什么感觉很重要。
[00:18:05.100] looks like is also just crazy.
[00:18:05.100] 看起来也太疯狂了。
[00:18:07.800] Because sometimes I'll ask, they'll be like, how many pounds do you want?
[00:18:07.800] 因为有时候我会问，他们会说，你想要多少磅？
[00:18:10.500] And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:18:10.500] 我当时就想，我不知道。
[00:18:11.560] Like how many should I get?
[00:18:11.560] 我应该买多少？
[00:18:12.820] Like you tell me.
[00:18:12.820] 就像你告诉我的那样。
[00:18:14.000] Yeah, I feel like that's harder with the filets because I think at least for the like ground
[00:18:14.000] 是的，我觉得用鱼片的话更难，因为我觉得至少对于肉糜来说是这样。
[00:18:19.700] meat, the prepackaged ones will say like, oh, this is, you know, half a pound or this is
[00:18:19.700] 肉类，预包装的会标明，比如，哦，这是半磅，或者这是……
[00:18:23.800] a pound.
[00:18:23.800] 一英镑。
[00:18:24.220] So I'm just like envisioning that.
[00:18:24.220] 所以我现在就在想象那个画面。
[00:18:25.820] But for the filets, it's way harder.
[00:18:25.820] 但对于鱼片来说，这就难多了。
[00:18:27.440] I'm like, okay, I don't know how much that cut looks like.
[00:18:27.440] 我当时就想，好吧，我不知道那块地方看起来有多大。
[00:18:30.540] It could be 0.3 pounds for all I know.
[00:18:30.540] 就我所知，也可能是0.3磅。
[00:18:33.940] It's like when you order steak at restaurants and it's like three ounce or like six ounce.
[00:18:33.940] 这就好比你在餐厅点牛排，结果上来的是三盎司或者六盎司。
[00:18:39.140] I'm like, I literally have no idea what this is.
[00:18:39.140] 我简直不知道这是什么。
[00:18:42.060] They're like, thanks.
[00:18:42.060] 他们说，谢谢。
[00:18:43.100] This means nothing to me.
[00:18:43.100] 这对我来说毫无意义。
[00:18:45.180] They're like, would you like the three ounce or the six ounce?
[00:18:45.180] 他们会问，您想要三盎司还是六盎司？
[00:18:47.720] And I'm like, um, how much does a normal human eat?
[00:18:47.720] 我当时就想，嗯，一个正常人一天要吃多少东西？
[00:18:52.440] So literally, but I feel like parents are so good about that kind of stuff.
[00:18:52.440] 确实如此，但我感觉父母在这方面做得很好。
[00:18:55.760] Yeah.
[00:18:55.760] 是的。
[00:18:56.440] They can just look and instantly be like, yeah, that's like 12.4 ounces.
[00:18:56.440] 他们只需看一眼就能立刻明白，是的，那大约是 12.4 盎司。
[00:19:00.860] I'm like, is your are your eyeballs calculators?
[00:19:00.860] 我心想，你们的眼睛是计算器吗？
[00:19:04.060] And I'm like, dude, you didn't even grow up in the freaking imperial system.
[00:19:04.060] 我当时就想，老兄，你根本就没在英制体系下长大。
[00:19:08.720] How do you know this?
[00:19:08.720] 你是怎么知道的？
[00:19:10.140] Even with the conversions, they're still better and faster than us.
[00:19:10.140] 即使经过转换，他们仍然比我们更好更快。
[00:19:14.700] There was this one time where I was kind of confused because the weather.
[00:19:14.700] 有一次，因为天气原因，我有点困惑。
[00:19:19.300] Okay.
[00:19:19.300] 好的。
[00:19:19.660] So in California, it very rarely ever goes below 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:19:19.660] 所以在加州，气温很少会低于华氏50度。
[00:19:24.800] Right.
[00:19:24.800] 正确的。
[00:19:25.060] And so anything below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, I literally have no idea what that means.
[00:19:25.060] 所以，低于华氏50度的任何温度，我真的完全不知道那意味着什么。
[00:19:30.140] But in Celsius, I do understand it because I've experienced lower temps in Celsius.
[00:19:30.140] 但是用摄氏度来表示，我能理解，因为我经历过更低的摄氏度温度。
[00:19:35.600] I was like, what does this even mean?
[00:19:35.600] 我当时就想，这到底是什么意思？
[00:19:37.260] Like, what is 40 degrees?
[00:19:37.260] 比如，40度是多少度？
[00:19:38.520] And so I looked it up in Celsius and my dad was like, dude, are you stupid?
[00:19:38.520] 于是我查了一下摄氏度，我爸就说，兄弟，你是不是傻？
[00:19:41.640] And then he gave me the conversion equation.
[00:19:41.640] 然后他给了我换算公式。
[00:19:43.940] And I was like, you just have that off the top of your head.
[00:19:43.940] 我当时就想，你这是信手拈来啊。
[00:19:46.480] Like, ready?
[00:19:46.480] 准备好了吗？
[00:19:47.440] Like, what?
[00:19:47.440] 比如什么？
[00:19:49.120] Wait, I feel like I'm torn between being like, yeah, the Celsius Fahrenheit conversion equation is really easy.
[00:19:49.120] 等等，我感觉自己很矛盾，一方面觉得，是啊，摄氏度和华氏度的转换公式真的很容易。
[00:19:55.200] But also, like, I myself don't know it.
[00:19:55.200] 但是，我自己也不知道。
[00:19:57.340] So I can't clown you.
[00:19:57.340] 所以我不能嘲笑你。
[00:19:59.520] It is not that difficult.
[00:19:59.520] 其实没那么难。
[00:20:01.740] But yeah, like, why would I just know it off the top of my head?
[00:20:01.740] 但是，是啊，我怎么可能凭空想出来呢？
[00:20:06.160] Honestly, being able to Google stuff in like two seconds just at our fingertips has ruined my ability to retain any information.
[00:20:06.160] 说实话，现在动动手指就能在两秒钟内用谷歌搜索到信息，这严重影响了我的记忆力。
[00:20:13.920] That's so true.
[00:20:13.920] 说得太对了。
[00:20:14.920] And I have like a Google Home too.
[00:20:14.920] 我也有一个谷歌智能音箱。
[00:20:17.060] So sometimes I'll just ask it directly.
[00:20:17.060] 所以有时候我会直接问。
[00:20:19.180] I'll be like, what is this degrees in Celsius?
[00:20:19.180] 我会问，这温度是多少摄氏度？
[00:20:22.600] No, I literally do that too with my Alexa.
[00:20:22.600] 不，我也真的用我的 Alexa 这么做过。
[00:20:26.640] It's gotten to the point where I'll ask it when I wake up and I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:20:26.640] 现在已经到了我早上醒来问这个问题，然后我就说，哦，好吧。
[00:20:30.720] And then like 10 minutes later after my shower, I'm like, what temperature did they say I was going to be?
[00:20:30.720] 洗完澡大概过了 10 分钟，我就想，他们说我的体温会是多少度来着？
[00:20:36.500] Like, can you repeat that?
[00:20:36.500] 你能再说一遍吗？
[00:20:37.980] Oh my God, dude, it's so bad.
[00:20:37.980] 我的天哪，老兄，情况太糟糕了。
[00:20:40.180] I recently went on a trip and it was maybe two or three days.
[00:20:40.180] 我最近出去旅行了，大概两三天吧。
[00:20:44.860] Immediately, I was like, wow, I miss my Google Home.
[00:20:44.860] 我当时立刻就想，哇，我好想念我的 Google Home。
[00:20:47.980] I had just the urge to ask like, hey, Google, so many times throughout the day.
[00:20:47.980] 我一天中好几次都忍不住想问：“嘿，谷歌！”
[00:20:53.140] I was like, this might be a problem.
[00:20:53.140] 我当时就想，这可能有点问题。
[00:20:57.460] We're slowly becoming our parents.
[00:20:57.460] 我们正在慢慢变成我们的父母。
[00:20:59.560] Oh God.
[00:20:59.560] 我的天哪。
[00:21:00.660] Okay.
[00:21:00.660] 好的。
[00:21:00.820] I thought of another example.
[00:21:00.820] 我又想到了一个例子。
[00:21:02.600] This one is slightly less positive.
[00:21:02.600] 这条评论稍微没那么积极。
[00:21:04.440] But I feel like when I was younger, I was always buying shoes that were so cute, but uncomfortable.
[00:21:04.440] 但我感觉我小时候总是买一些很可爱但穿着不舒服的鞋子。
[00:21:13.260] Comfort was not even in my like top three list of priorities.
[00:21:13.260] 舒适甚至都不在我优先考虑的前三项之内。
[00:21:17.620] You know, I would just bear through the pain.
[00:21:17.620] 你知道，我只能默默忍受痛苦。
[00:21:20.140] I would buy really high heels for like formals and dances and stuff.
[00:21:20.140] 我会买很高的高跟鞋，参加正式场合、舞会之类的活动。
[00:21:24.440] And would just always wear these like toe pinching ballet flats and whatnot.
[00:21:24.440] 而且总是穿着那种会挤脚趾的芭蕾平底鞋之类的。
[00:21:29.160] But now that I'm older, I feel like comfort is one of the biggest things that I look for.
[00:21:29.160] 但现在我年纪大了，我觉得舒适是我最看重的东西之一。
[00:21:34.160] And if I know I need to go on a trip and there's going to be a nice dinner, so I'll need to bring my nice shoes.
[00:21:34.160] 如果我知道我要去旅行，而且会有一个不错的晚餐，那我肯定要带上我的好鞋。
[00:21:39.800] If I know we're going to be like walking around and whatnot, like I will also pack my comfy, huge, like wide toed sneakers as well.
[00:21:39.800] 如果我知道我们要四处走走什么的，我也会带上我那双舒适的、鞋头宽大的运动鞋。
[00:21:48.440] I can relate.
[00:21:48.440] 我感同身受。
[00:21:50.140] Comfort is big.
[00:21:50.140] 舒适很重要。
[00:21:51.420] You don't care as much about maybe quote unquote impressing the people around you.
[00:21:51.420] 你不太在意给周围的人留下“深刻印象”。
[00:21:56.420] It's more just like I could make a home in one piece and like happily, right?
[00:21:56.420] 更像是，我可以安顿下来，过上幸福快乐的生活，对吧？
[00:22:00.940] Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:00.940] 是啊是啊。
[00:22:02.900] I know what blisters feel like, so I will choose to avoid them.
[00:22:02.900] 我知道起水泡是什么感觉，所以我选择避免起水泡。
[00:22:08.840] Yeah, even like the thought of breaking in new shoes is annoying.
[00:22:08.840] 是啊，就连想到要磨合新鞋都觉得烦。
[00:22:13.820] I'm like, why can't they just be comfortable out of the box?
[00:22:13.820] 我心想，为什么他们就不能开箱即用，舒适自在呢？
[00:22:16.660] I know.
[00:22:16.660] 我知道。
[00:22:17.300] Like I remember one time I got these Doc Martens and I tried to break them in for like a year.
[00:22:17.300] 我记得有一次我买了双马丁靴，我花了差不多一年时间才把它们穿合脚。
[00:22:22.520] And they would just refuse to break in.
[00:22:22.520] 他们就是不肯破门而入。
[00:22:24.680] I don't know if it was like the model I got or maybe the size was off or something like that.
[00:22:24.680] 我不知道是不是我买的型号有问题，还是尺寸不对之类的。
[00:22:27.960] But I still fucking wore them.
[00:22:27.960] 但我还是他妈的穿了它们。
[00:22:29.620] And every time I wore them, I would just like bleed everywhere.
[00:22:29.620] 每次穿上它们，我都会浑身流血。
[00:22:32.480] But I was like, oh, my outfit, my fit looks good.
[00:22:32.480] 但我当时想，哦，我的衣服，我的搭配看起来很棒。
[00:22:37.460] And now I'm just like, what was wrong with me?
[00:22:37.460] 现在我就想，我到底是怎么了？
[00:22:40.780] I would never do that in this day and age.
[00:22:40.780] 在如今这个时代，我绝不会那样做。
[00:22:43.960] Oh my God.
[00:22:43.960] 我的天啊。
[00:22:44.800] And I guess that also plays into the whole thing about, you know, trying to sleep early,
[00:22:44.800] 我想这也跟早睡这件事有关。
[00:22:49.880] getting the right amount of sleep, being healthier.
[00:22:49.880] 获得充足的睡眠，更健康。
[00:22:52.860] I feel like that's all part of, you know, taking on the responsibility and recognizing
[00:22:52.860] 我觉得这一切都是承担责任和认识到自身价值的一部分。
[00:22:58.500] the need to take care of yourself.
[00:22:58.500] 需要照顾好自己。
[00:23:00.880] Definitely.
[00:23:00.880] 确实。
[00:23:01.180] I mean, maybe it's just like we see more and experience more.
[00:23:01.180] 我的意思是，也许只是因为我们见识更多、经历更多而已。
[00:23:06.340] We learn to not take things like health or like comfort for granted.
[00:23:06.340] 我们学会了不要把健康或舒适等事物视为理所当然。
[00:23:10.900] On a lighter note, I thought of this because holiday season is coming up.
[00:23:10.900] 轻松一点来说，我想到这件事是因为假期快到了。
[00:23:16.360] But another thing that makes me feel pretty adult is for sure going to family friend parties,
[00:23:16.360] 但还有一件事确实让我觉得自己很成熟，那就是参加家人朋友的聚会。
[00:23:23.560] even if my parents aren't around, like if they're out of town or something.
[00:23:23.560] 即使我的父母不在身边，比如他们出差之类的。
[00:23:28.360] I don't know.
[00:23:28.360] 我不知道。
[00:23:29.080] I feel like I chat with adults a little bit at these parties.
[00:23:29.080] 我觉得在这些聚会上，我能和成年人聊上几句。
[00:23:32.960] But, you know, back in the day, the separation between adult and kid was always so clear cut.
[00:23:32.960] 但是，你知道，在过去，成人和儿童之间的界限总是非常清晰的。
[00:23:40.480] It's almost like I'm forcing my way in like, hey guys, I'm an adult too now.
[00:23:40.480] 我感觉自己好像在强行挤进去，好像在说：“嘿，伙计们，我现在也是个成年人了。”
[00:23:47.300] Honestly, yeah, that is such a big one.
[00:23:47.300] 说实话，是啊，这确实是个大问题。
[00:23:49.700] It's like people who felt like giants to you are now not necessarily peers,
[00:23:49.700] 这就像那些曾经在你眼中如同巨人般的人，现在未必是你的同辈人了。
[00:23:55.060] but a little bit more on equal footing.
[00:23:55.060] 但双方地位更加平等一些。
[00:23:57.580] Yeah.
[00:23:57.580] 是的。
[00:23:58.100] Recently, actually, you were also there.
[00:23:58.100] 事实上，不久前你也在那里。
[00:24:00.080] But recently I did like a big golf thing with my mom and like a bunch of her friends.
[00:24:00.080] 但最近我和妈妈以及她的一群朋友一起打了一场大型高尔夫活动。
[00:24:07.180] And then afterwards we went out for dinner.
[00:24:07.180] 然后我们出去吃了晚饭。
[00:24:09.020] We just all sat around the dinner table chatting about our day.
[00:24:09.020] 我们围坐在餐桌旁，聊着各自一天发生的事情。
[00:24:12.500] Oh my God.
[00:24:12.500] 我的天啊。
[00:24:13.180] And I was like, wait, I'm included?
[00:24:13.180] 我当时就想，等等，我也算在内吗？
[00:24:15.160] I can open my mouth and talk.
[00:24:15.160] 我可以张嘴说话。
[00:24:17.660] Oh my God.
[00:24:17.660] 我的天啊。
[00:24:18.460] It's like that time when one of our friends who is like good family friends with James,
[00:24:18.460] 就像我们一位和詹姆斯关系很好的朋友，曾经……
[00:24:24.040] he told all of us, he was like, oh my God,
[00:24:24.040] 他跟我们所有人说，他当时就想，我的天哪，
[00:24:26.340] Jisoo and James are out on a triple date with a few of our like family friend parents.
[00:24:26.340] Jisoo 和 James 与几位像家人朋友一样的父母一起外出进行三人约会。
[00:24:31.220] Like after you guys got married.
[00:24:31.220] 就像你们结婚之后那样。
[00:24:33.380] And I was like, damn, that is, that's adulting.
[00:24:33.380] 我当时就想，天哪，这就是成年人的生活。
[00:24:38.420] You guys made it.
[00:24:38.420] 你们成功了。
[00:24:41.320] Dude, the phrase triple date is so fucking crazy to describe that.
[00:24:41.320] 老兄，用“三人约会”来形容这件事简直太疯狂了。
[00:24:46.680] Dude, but it was, wasn't it?
[00:24:46.680] 老兄，但事实的确如此，不是吗？
[00:24:48.860] It low-key was.
[00:24:48.860] 确实如此，虽然并不显眼。
[00:24:49.960] After I saw that, I was like, wow, I can't even say anything because it's true.
[00:24:49.960] 看到之后，我简直惊呆了，我都不知道该说什么，因为这是真的。
[00:24:55.060] But honestly, maybe the barrier that we felt with our family friend parents and stuff when
[00:24:55.060] 但说实话，也许我们和家人朋友的父母之间产生的隔阂，才是真正让我们感到不自在的原因。
[00:25:00.880] we were younger was not just the age, but the fact that we were like students and stuff.
[00:25:00.880] 我们当时更年轻，不仅仅是指年龄，还因为我们当时还是学生之类的。
[00:25:05.540] Because I feel like as soon as I entered the workforce, I was able to talk about work with
[00:25:05.540] 因为我觉得我一进入职场，就能和别人谈论工作了。
[00:25:10.160] parents.
[00:25:10.160] 父母。
[00:25:10.820] And even on the golf day that we did, James and I golfed with the dads.
[00:25:10.820] 即使在我们组织的打高尔夫球日，我和詹姆斯也是和爸爸们一起打的。
[00:25:15.680] One of the dads has like a very similar professional background to James.
[00:25:15.680] 其中一位爸爸的职业背景与詹姆斯非常相似。
[00:25:19.800] They use like the same language in their coding and whatnot, just like work in very similar
[00:25:19.800] 他们在编程等方面使用的语言几乎相同，工作内容也非常相似。
[00:25:25.180] fields, even within engineering.
[00:25:25.180] 甚至在工程领域也是如此。
[00:25:27.260] Yeah.
[00:25:27.260] 是的。
[00:25:27.580] They like talked about it.
[00:25:27.580] 他们喜欢谈论这件事。
[00:25:28.900] Whoa.
[00:25:28.900] 哇。
[00:25:29.520] For like, I don't know, a good five minutes, every couple of holes or whatnot.
[00:25:29.520] 大概，我不知道，大概五分钟左右，每打完几个洞什么的就停一下。
[00:25:33.400] And I was like, this is crazy.
[00:25:33.400] 我当时就想，这太疯狂了。
[00:25:34.700] Like there's common ground to the point where there's professional common ground and you can
[00:25:34.700] 就像存在共同点，甚至到了专业领域的共同点，你可以……
[00:25:39.060] talk about that kind of stuff.
[00:25:39.060] 聊聊这类事情。
[00:25:40.240] Wow.
[00:25:40.240] 哇。
[00:25:41.340] I think that's super reasonable because honestly, just thinking and reflecting at work, I talk
[00:25:41.340] 我觉得这非常合理，因为说实话，在工作中思考和反思的时候，我经常会说……
[00:25:48.760] to people who are probably around my parents' age quite often too.
[00:25:48.760] 我也经常和一些年纪可能和我父母差不多的人交流。
[00:25:53.600] And it's like very normal because they don't know you as like some kid who grew up.
[00:25:53.600] 而且这很正常，因为他们不把你当成一个长大成人的孩子。
[00:25:59.860] They just know you as who you are right now.
[00:25:59.860] 他们只认识现在的你。
[00:26:02.660] Right.
[00:26:02.660] 正确的。
[00:26:02.960] And so that's honestly not so different from these family friends.
[00:26:02.960] 所以，这其实和这些家人朋友并没有太大区别。
[00:26:06.780] They just have like more context about who you are, I guess.
[00:26:06.780] 我想，他们只是对你这个人有更多了解而已。
[00:26:10.740] Yeah, that's very true.
[00:26:10.740] 是的，确实如此。
[00:26:12.280] Like all these barriers are just being broken down every year.
[00:26:12.280] 感觉这些障碍每年都在被打破。
[00:26:15.860] I don't know about your family friend group, but in mine, none of the kids are married yet.
[00:26:15.860] 我不了解你们家的朋友圈，但在我们家，孩子们都还没结婚呢。
[00:26:22.800] And I feel like that is another barrier that would be taken down, you know, once that step
[00:26:22.800] 我觉得一旦迈出那一步，另一个障碍也会被消除。
[00:26:29.420] gets reached.
[00:26:29.420] 已到达。
[00:26:29.980] I don't know if it's like just you and James who are married or if other people have started
[00:26:29.980] 我不知道是不是只有你和詹姆斯结婚了，还是其他人也开始结婚了。
[00:26:34.420] getting married too.
[00:26:34.420] 我也要结婚了。
[00:26:35.740] That's a really good point.
[00:26:35.740] 这确实是个很好的观点。
[00:26:37.620] I mean, we're definitely not the only couple married within the family friends that we
[00:26:37.620] 我的意思是，我们肯定不是唯一一对在亲朋好友中结婚的夫妇。
[00:26:42.700] know and like see regularly.
[00:26:42.700] 认识并喜欢经常见到。
[00:26:44.780] And also there is a couple who we see who has recently had a baby.
[00:26:44.780] 我们还看到一对夫妇，他们最近刚生了孩子。
[00:26:50.780] Oh.
[00:26:50.780] 哦。
[00:26:51.600] So I'm really excited to see them hopefully this holiday season and just kind of like see
[00:26:51.600] 所以我很期待能在这个假期见到他们，就想看看他们。
[00:26:55.360] how that dynamic changes.
[00:26:55.360] 这种动态是如何变化的。
[00:26:56.580] Because I feel like going from a single slash unmarried woman to a married woman is a big
[00:26:56.580] 因为我觉得从单身/未婚女性变成已婚女性是一个很大的转变。
[00:27:01.860] jump.
[00:27:01.860] 跳。
[00:27:02.400] And then also the jump from being a married woman to a mom is also a big jump.
[00:27:02.400] 而且，从已婚女性到母亲的转变也是一个巨大的飞跃。
[00:27:07.680] Yeah.
[00:27:07.680] 是的。
[00:27:08.200] So yeah, I will report back.
[00:27:08.200] 好的，我会汇报情况。
[00:27:10.020] Okay.
[00:27:10.020] 好的。
[00:27:10.460] I'm excited to hear.
[00:27:10.460] 我很期待听到这个消息。
[00:27:12.600] This also makes me wonder what if you just showed up to one of these family friend things
[00:27:12.600] 这让我不禁想到，如果你直接去参加这种家庭朋友聚会会怎么样？
[00:27:18.260] and you tried to act really, I don't know, important in terms of like at work, maybe you're like,
[00:27:18.260] 然后你试图表现得非常，我不知道，在工作方面很重要，也许你会想，
[00:27:24.340] damn, it's been so busy.
[00:27:24.340] 哎，真是太忙了。
[00:27:25.900] I'm managing all these people and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:25.900] 我管理着这么多人，等等等等。
[00:27:29.560] I wonder if the parents would be like, whoa, they have like serious work going on.
[00:27:29.560] 我想知道父母会不会觉得：“哇，他们好像在忙着一件很重要的事。”
[00:27:34.560] They suddenly just start respecting you more.
[00:27:34.560] 他们突然开始更加尊重你了。
[00:27:38.680] I thought you were going to say the other way.
[00:27:38.680] 我以为你会说相反的话。
[00:27:40.980] They would be like, bro, I'm literally a VP at like this tech company.
[00:27:40.980] 他们会说，兄弟，我可是这家科技公司的副总裁啊。
[00:27:45.680] Like don't try to act like you're all busy.
[00:27:45.680] 别装作你们都很忙的样子。
[00:27:50.530] I mean, that is an interesting question though.
[00:27:50.530] 我的意思是，这确实是个有趣的问题。
[00:27:52.590] It's like, what do kids do to gain the respect of like family friend parents?
[00:27:52.590] 就像，孩子们要怎么做才能赢得像家人朋友一样的父母的尊重呢？
[00:27:57.690] Yeah.
[00:27:57.690] 是的。
[00:27:58.110] Because I want to say that they might still think we're just really young in our careers.
[00:27:58.110] 因为我想说的是，他们可能仍然认为我们只是职业生涯还很年轻。
[00:28:03.210] And I mean, to a certain point, that is also kind of true, but just because that is true
[00:28:03.210] 我的意思是，在某种程度上，这也有点道理，但仅仅因为这是事实，并不意味着它就一定是正确的。
[00:28:09.990] doesn't mean that there isn't complexity or things that happen at work that would be very
[00:28:09.990] 但这并不意味着工作中不存在复杂性，或者不会发生一些非常棘手的事情。
[00:28:15.930] similar to what happens to them in their work.
[00:28:15.930] 这和他们在工作中遇到的情况类似。
[00:28:19.150] Yeah.
[00:28:19.150] 是的。
[00:28:19.730] I mean, I don't know if this is just my personal opinion.
[00:28:19.730] 我的意思是，我不知道这是否只是我个人的观点。
[00:28:21.890] I am just only pulling from my experiences.
[00:28:21.890] 我只是在借鉴我自己的经验。
[00:28:25.250] Right.
[00:28:25.250] 正确的。
[00:28:25.610] I feel like gender also has to do a little bit with this because I feel like maybe this is
[00:28:25.610] 我觉得性别也跟这件事有点关系，因为我觉得这可能是
[00:28:30.870] more of a male thing.
[00:28:30.870] 更多的是男性才会有的想法。
[00:28:32.150] Like I feel like when I talk to family friend moms, we don't talk about career or like work
[00:28:32.150] 我觉得我和家里的妈妈朋友聊天时，我们很少聊事业或者工作之类的话题。
[00:28:37.830] that extensively.
[00:28:37.830] 非常广泛。
[00:28:38.990] But I feel like I've heard James have like really long in-depth conversations about what
[00:28:38.990] 但我感觉我好像听詹姆斯和别人进行过非常长时间的深入对话，讨论过什么话题。
[00:28:43.210] he does at work.
[00:28:43.210] 他在工作中确实如此。
[00:28:44.190] I see.
[00:28:44.190] 我懂了。
[00:28:44.610] So I wonder if part of it is kind of gendered, at least in like Asian circles.
[00:28:44.610] 所以我想知道，这其中是否带有性别色彩，至少在亚洲圈子里是这样。
[00:28:49.150] Honestly, maybe.
[00:28:49.150] 说实话，也许吧。
[00:28:50.370] I think also the most I get sometimes because I'm also not in like engineering, right?
[00:28:50.370] 我觉得有时候我能得到最多的也是因为我不是搞工程的，对吧？
[00:28:57.290] So low key, no one truly knows what I do.
[00:28:57.290] 我为人非常低调，没人真正知道我做什么。
[00:29:01.290] Literally a month or two ago, my mom was like, wait, hold on.
[00:29:01.290] 就在一两个月前，我妈说，等等，稍等一下。
[00:29:04.150] So what do you do, Crystal?
[00:29:04.150] 那么，克丽丝塔尔，你打算做什么呢？
[00:29:07.870] Your mom?
[00:29:07.870] 你妈妈？
[00:29:08.770] Yeah.
[00:29:08.770] 是的。
[00:29:09.090] Not even a family friend parent.
[00:29:09.090] 甚至连一位家庭朋友的家长都不是。
[00:29:11.230] And I was like, wait, mom, I feel like I've shown you my work before.
[00:29:11.230] 我当时就想，等等，妈妈，我觉得我以前好像给你看过我的作品。
[00:29:16.430] She's like, I just need a refresher.
[00:29:16.430] 她说道：“我只需要复习一下。”
[00:29:17.990] Yeah.
[00:29:17.990] 是的。
[00:29:18.450] Yeah, pretty much.
[00:29:18.450] 是的，差不多。
[00:29:21.130] But I'll get like, oh, are you still working at whatever company?
[00:29:21.130] 但我会收到这样的询问：哦，你还在那家公司工作吗？
[00:29:24.690] And I'm like, yeah.
[00:29:24.690] 我当时就想，是啊。
[00:29:25.870] And then they're like, cool.
[00:29:25.870] 然后他们就觉得，酷。
[00:29:26.930] Because to them, it's like, that's a good company.
[00:29:26.930] 因为在他们看来，那是一家不错的公司。
[00:29:29.490] Like, that's all we really need to know.
[00:29:29.490] 其实，我们只需要知道这些就够了。
[00:29:31.750] Sounds like you're doing great.
[00:29:31.750] 听起来你一切都很好。
[00:29:33.570] Don't need to know the details.
[00:29:33.570] 不需要了解细节。
[00:29:35.930] The checklist of how they like rate your career is so small.
[00:29:35.930] 他们评价你职业生涯的标准清单非常短。
[00:29:41.210] It's like, do I know the name?
[00:29:41.210] 我好像不知道它的名字是什么？
[00:29:43.030] Yes.
[00:29:43.030] 是的。
[00:29:43.650] Yeah.
[00:29:43.650] 是的。
[00:29:43.890] And they're like, but I low key have no idea what she does.
[00:29:43.890] 他们会说，但我其实完全不知道她是做什么的。
[00:29:46.330] So we shouldn't ask any more questions.
[00:29:46.330] 所以我们不应该再问任何问题了。
[00:29:48.190] We shouldn't confuse ourselves further.
[00:29:48.190] 我们不应该让自己更加困惑。
[00:29:50.970] Let's just leave it as it is.
[00:29:50.970] 就让它保持现状吧。
[00:29:54.470] God, that's so funny.
[00:29:54.470] 我的天，这太搞笑了。
[00:29:56.030] I'm also just imagining myself as like a future family friend parent.
[00:29:56.030] 我也把自己想象成未来某个家庭朋友的家长。
[00:30:00.050] Just like trying to talk to people decades younger, being like, how's your job?
[00:30:00.050] 就像试图和比自己年轻几十岁的人交谈，比如问：“你的工作怎么样？”
[00:30:10.630] Oh my God, that's so true.
[00:30:10.630] 我的天哪，说得太对了。
[00:30:12.770] You're like, is like school still the same?
[00:30:12.770] 你会想，学校现在还和以前一样吗？
[00:30:18.950] Like, do you guys still learn this?
[00:30:18.950] 你们现在还在学这个吗？
[00:30:21.330] Like, do you still read this book at school?
[00:30:21.330] 你们学校现在还读这本书吗？
[00:30:24.550] Jokes aside, though, sometimes when I talk to my Gen Z co-workers,
[00:30:24.550] 玩笑归玩笑，不过有时候我和我的Z世代同事聊天时，
[00:30:27.850] I do feel this way a little bit.
[00:30:27.850] 我确实有点这种感觉。
[00:30:29.950] It's like half feeling old and also half just being like,
[00:30:29.950] 感觉一半是觉得自己老了，一半又只是单纯地觉得……
[00:30:33.210] wow, this is reality now.
[00:30:33.210] 哇，这就是现在的现实。
[00:30:34.690] I'm not the youngest person at my work anymore.
[00:30:34.690] 我不再是公司里最年轻的人了。
[00:30:36.750] Dude, I wish.
[00:30:36.750] 老兄，我真希望如此。
[00:30:39.730] I've still remained the youngest person at work.
[00:30:39.730] 我仍然是公司里最年轻的人。
[00:30:42.330] Dude, I think there's pros and cons, but maybe mostly pros.
[00:30:42.330] 兄弟，我觉得有利有弊，但可能利大于弊。
[00:30:45.310] Like, that's a little cool.
[00:30:45.310] 这还挺酷的。
[00:30:46.610] That's true.
[00:30:46.610] 这是真的。
[00:30:47.170] You're still like the hip person.
[00:30:47.170] 你依然很潮。
[00:30:48.490] It's definitely not terrible,
[00:30:48.490] 这绝对不算糟糕，
[00:30:49.890] but I just, I want to know what Gen Z is like in the workforce.
[00:30:49.890] 但我只是想了解一下Z世代在职场上的情况。
[00:30:54.850] I will say it's very interesting.
[00:30:54.850] 我觉得这很有意思。
[00:30:56.290] I think it's really fascinating, actually,
[00:30:56.290] 我觉得这真的很有意思。
[00:30:58.610] because maybe even up to our generation,
[00:30:58.610] 因为或许直到我们这一代，
[00:31:02.030] work is like formal, you know?
[00:31:02.030] 工作就像正式场合一样，你知道吗？
[00:31:04.130] So like there's a side of you that you present at work,
[00:31:04.130] 就像你在工作中会展现出你的另一面一样，
[00:31:07.130] but it may not necessarily be what you are presenting to like your friends.
[00:31:07.130] 但这可能并非你想要展示给朋友看的东西。
[00:31:11.930] Right.
[00:31:11.930] 正确的。
[00:31:12.230] But I feel like for Gen Z,
[00:31:12.230] 但我感觉对于Z世代来说，
[00:31:13.770] that gap is a little bit smaller and less pronounced.
[00:31:13.770] 那个差距稍微小了一些，也不那么明显了。
[00:31:17.870] So there's definitely a sense of casualness
[00:31:17.870] 所以这里确实有一种随意的感觉。
[00:31:20.590] and kind of friend vibes,
[00:31:20.590] 感觉像朋友一样，
[00:31:22.430] less formality in the words or like phrases that they use
[00:31:22.430] 他们使用的词语或类似短语的正式程度较低。
[00:31:25.410] and definitely less formality in like their outfits.
[00:31:25.410] 而且他们的着装也明显更加随意。
[00:31:27.910] And I kind of like it,
[00:31:27.910] 我还挺喜欢的。
[00:31:29.210] but it's also like a little bit intimidating.
[00:31:29.210] 但同时也有点吓人。
[00:31:31.490] Oh, really?
[00:31:31.490] 哦真的吗？
[00:31:32.250] Yeah.
[00:31:32.250] 是的。
[00:31:32.830] Oh my God.
[00:31:32.830] 我的天啊。
[00:31:33.590] Okay.
[00:31:33.590] 好的。
[00:31:33.970] Low key though,
[00:31:33.970] 虽然很低调，
[00:31:34.990] maybe that is what I seem like to my coworkers.
[00:31:34.990] 或许在同事眼里，我就是这样的人。
[00:31:37.710] I feel like I go into work really casually.
[00:31:37.710] 我觉得自己上班很随意。
[00:31:40.410] I'm a little quiet though.
[00:31:40.410] 我性格比较内向。
[00:31:41.710] So I don't know about that part
[00:31:41.710] 所以那部分我不太清楚。
[00:31:42.890] in terms of showing a lot of personality,
[00:31:42.890] 就展现个性而言，
[00:31:44.950] but I do think I still give off the like casual, chill vibes.
[00:31:44.950] 但我认为我仍然给人一种随意、放松的感觉。
[00:31:48.750] So they're probably just like,
[00:31:48.750] 所以他们可能就觉得，
[00:31:50.270] yeah, Crystal's just young.
[00:31:50.270] 是的，克丽丝塔尔还年轻。
[00:31:52.190] Damn.
[00:31:52.190] 该死。
[00:31:53.210] Maybe I should be more like that.
[00:31:53.210] 或许我应该更像他那样。
[00:31:55.150] Sometimes I wear,
[00:31:55.150] 有时我会穿，
[00:31:56.050] I mean,
[00:31:56.050] 我是说，
[00:31:56.430] I think I wear like slightly more formal outfits in general,
[00:31:56.430] 我觉得我平时穿的衣服比较正式一些。
[00:31:59.090] but there's this one cardigan that I have,
[00:31:59.090] 但我有一件开衫，
[00:32:02.770] which I feel like it's a cute cardigan,
[00:32:02.770] 我觉得这件开衫挺可爱的。
[00:32:04.290] but I think I'm just styling it poorly.
[00:32:04.290] 但我认为我只是搭配得不好。
[00:32:05.850] But every time I wear it,
[00:32:05.850] 但我每次穿它的时候，
[00:32:06.910] it's like a white cardigan,
[00:32:06.910] 它就像一件白色开衫，
[00:32:08.630] tweed jacket vibes,
[00:32:08.630] 粗花呢外套的感觉，
[00:32:09.910] but not tweed.
[00:32:09.910] 但不是粗花呢。
[00:32:10.990] And every time I wear it and I look in the mirror,
[00:32:10.990] 每次我穿上它照镜子的时候，
[00:32:13.050] I feel like I'm doing like Hillary Clinton cosplay.
[00:32:13.050] 我觉得自己像是在扮演希拉里·克林顿。
[00:32:18.510] I can envision it now that you've said that.
[00:32:18.510] 你这么一说，我现在能想象出来了。
[00:32:23.420] And I just,
[00:32:23.420] 而我只是，
[00:32:25.040] I feel like my coworkers must think I'm like a billion years old.
[00:32:25.040] 我觉得我的同事们肯定认为我好像有亿万岁似的。
[00:32:31.410] Oh my God.
[00:32:31.410] 我的天啊。
[00:32:32.670] They're like,
[00:32:32.670] 他们就像是：
[00:32:33.230] she gets married and these are the outfits she comes in now.
[00:32:33.230] 她结婚了，这是她现在穿的衣服。
[00:32:36.950] Exactly.
[00:32:36.950] 确切地。
[00:32:40.190] Yeah,
[00:32:40.190] 是的，
[00:32:40.910] I definitely go in pretty casually.
[00:32:40.910] 我肯定是以比较随意的态度去的。
[00:32:42.510] And then I wonder sometimes like,
[00:32:42.510] 然后我有时会想，
[00:32:44.270] oh,
[00:32:44.270] 哦，
[00:32:44.650] am I maybe too casual?
[00:32:44.650] 我是不是太随意了？
[00:32:46.230] Should I dress up a little bit?
[00:32:46.230] 我应该稍微打扮一下吗？
[00:32:48.030] Match my coworkers vibes.
[00:32:48.030] 与同事们的风格保持一致。
[00:32:50.030] But then I'm like,
[00:32:50.030] 但后来我就想，
[00:32:51.370] it's kind of like a lot of work.
[00:32:51.370] 这工作量相当大。
[00:32:54.290] You think about it for like half a second.
[00:32:54.290] 你大概只考虑了半秒钟。
[00:32:56.090] You're like,
[00:32:56.090] 你就像，
[00:32:56.390] I'm good.
[00:32:56.390] 我很好。
[00:32:57.870] Also,
[00:32:57.870] 还，
[00:32:58.370] I think maybe if I tried too hard,
[00:32:58.370] 我想也许如果我太努力了，
[00:33:00.090] they might be like,
[00:33:00.090] 他们可能会这样想：
[00:33:00.930] oh,
[00:33:00.930] 哦，
[00:33:01.570] that's not how Crystal usually dresses.
[00:33:01.570] 克丽丝塔尔平时不这么穿。
[00:33:03.410] Like she's usually very casual.
[00:33:03.410] 她平时就很随意。
[00:33:04.890] Like,
[00:33:04.890] 喜欢，
[00:33:05.070] is there something going on?
[00:33:05.070] 出什么事了吗？
[00:33:06.890] Why is she dressed up?
[00:33:06.890] 她为什么穿得这么盛装？
[00:33:08.690] Right,
[00:33:08.690] 正确的，
[00:33:09.090] right.
[00:33:09.090] 正确的。
[00:33:09.210] This is like the road I've paved.
[00:33:09.210] 这就像是我亲手铺就的路。
[00:33:12.110] So I just must continue down on it.
[00:33:12.110] 所以我必须继续往下走。
[00:33:15.710] No,
[00:33:15.710] 不，
[00:33:16.310] I dig that though.
[00:33:16.310] 我挺喜欢的。
[00:33:17.750] I feel like it's kind of a privilege to grow up in an era where we don't have to wear like a suit and tie to work every day.
[00:33:17.750] 我觉得生活在这样一个时代是一种特权，因为我们不必每天穿西装打领带去上班。
[00:33:23.570] Yeah.
[00:33:23.570] 是的。
[00:33:23.930] So might as well take advantage of it.
[00:33:23.930] 所以不妨好好利用一下。
[00:33:25.550] You know,
[00:33:25.550] 你知道，
[00:33:26.130] I go into work in like t-shirts all the time.
[00:33:26.130] 我经常穿着T恤去上班。
[00:33:29.570] I mean,
[00:33:29.570] 我是说，
[00:33:30.330] especially in ESSA,
[00:33:30.330] 尤其是在ESSA中，
[00:33:31.510] sometimes walking around during like commuting hours on the streets of San Francisco.
[00:33:31.510] 有时会在旧金山的通勤高峰时段四处走走。
[00:33:35.490] I'm like,
[00:33:35.490] 我当时就想，
[00:33:36.250] wow,
[00:33:36.250] 哇，
[00:33:37.150] people in New York would have like a fit,
[00:33:37.150] 纽约人肯定会气疯的。
[00:33:39.970] you know?
[00:33:39.970] 你知道？
[00:33:40.730] True.
[00:33:40.730] 真的。
[00:33:41.350] Barney from how I met your mother would actually have like a heart attack.
[00:33:41.350] 《老爸老妈的浪漫史》里的巴尼要是看到这一幕，真会吓得心脏病发作。
[00:33:46.210] Okay.
[00:33:46.210] 好的。
[00:33:46.650] I will admit though,
[00:33:46.650] 不过我必须承认，
[00:33:47.810] when I worked in SF,
[00:33:47.810] 我在旧金山工作的时候，
[00:33:49.530] I would dress up a little more.
[00:33:49.530] 我会稍微打扮一下。
[00:33:50.790] I feel like because I work in like South Bay,
[00:33:50.790] 我觉得因为我在南湾工作，
[00:33:53.410] like more Silicon Valley area.
[00:33:53.410] 更像是硅谷地区。
[00:33:55.850] It's just so much tech and like way more casual.
[00:33:55.850] 它科技含量很高，但氛围却轻松随意得多。
[00:34:00.150] I can get away with it a lot.
[00:34:00.150] 我经常能侥幸逃脱惩罚。
[00:34:01.770] I'll go in with like an oversized hoodie sometimes and it literally doesn't matter.
[00:34:01.770] 我有时候会穿着超大号的连帽衫进去，其实根本没关系。
[00:34:07.190] Yeah.
[00:34:07.190] 是的。
[00:34:07.690] I mean,
[00:34:07.690] 我是说，
[00:34:08.310] I guess when you're like driving into work,
[00:34:08.310] 我想当你开车上班的时候，
[00:34:11.330] you don't get perceived as much because you just get out of your car,
[00:34:11.330] 因为你只是下了车，所以不太引人注目。
[00:34:14.890] go into your office building,
[00:34:14.890] 进入你的办公楼，
[00:34:15.670] and then immediately get back into your car.
[00:34:15.670] 然后立即回到车里。
[00:34:17.690] But if you're taking like public transportation or something,
[00:34:17.690] 但如果你乘坐公共交通工具之类的，
[00:34:20.590] there's just risk of like more people seeing you.
[00:34:20.590] 只是存在更多人看到你的风险。
[00:34:23.590] True.
[00:34:23.590] 真的。
[00:34:24.050] And the city is just a little more alive.
[00:34:24.050] 这座城市也因此多了几分生机。
[00:34:26.190] What if after work,
[00:34:26.190] 如果下班后，
[00:34:27.030] you want to go out and like grab dinner with someone?
[00:34:27.030] 你想和某人出去吃顿饭吗？
[00:34:29.470] Right.
[00:34:29.470] 正确的。
[00:34:29.710] So it just makes more sense to be like a little dressed up just in case something happens.
[00:34:29.710] 所以，稍微打扮一下以防万一更有意义。
[00:34:33.690] Maybe there's a happy hour here down in like the South Bay.
[00:34:33.690] 也许南湾那边有欢乐时光活动。
[00:34:38.210] Dress however you want.
[00:34:38.210] 想穿什么就穿什么。
[00:34:39.550] It doesn't matter.
[00:34:39.550] 没关系。
[00:34:42.610] It's a special perk of being in the Bay Area.
[00:34:42.610] 这是身处湾区的一项特殊福利。
[00:34:45.990] Yeah,
[00:34:45.990] 是的，
[00:34:46.590] for sure.
[00:34:46.590] 一定。
[00:34:47.430] Oh,
[00:34:47.430] 哦，
[00:34:47.990] you know what?
[00:34:47.990] 你知道吗？
[00:34:48.590] I have one more thing that really makes me feel like an adult.
[00:34:48.590] 还有一件事真的让我觉得自己像个大人了。
[00:34:52.450] It's kind of like back to our whole like grocery shopping and errands topic.
[00:34:52.450] 这有点像我们之前讨论的去超市购物和跑腿办事的话题。
[00:34:57.770] But whenever I buy a bunch of meat and then I have to like separate it into portions and then freeze it.
[00:34:57.770] 但是每次我买了一大堆肉，然后我必须把它分成小份，再冷冻起来。
[00:35:07.330] I feel super like an adult in that moment.
[00:35:07.330] 那一刻，我感觉自己像个大人。
[00:35:10.350] Yes,
[00:35:10.350] 是的，
[00:35:10.710] that's such a good point.
[00:35:10.710] 这真是个好观点。
[00:35:13.070] Wombo combo of being economically smart and also just time efficient.
[00:35:13.070] 既经济实惠又省时省力，真是绝妙的组合。
[00:35:18.630] Yes,
[00:35:18.630] 是的，
[00:35:19.810] that ground pork that I bought.
[00:35:19.810] 我买的那种猪肉馅。
[00:35:21.730] I went home and I literally portion them out so that it's enough for one.
[00:35:21.730] 我回家后把它们分装好，确保每份只够一个人吃。
[00:35:26.710] I don't know meal,
[00:35:26.710] 我不知道这顿饭，
[00:35:27.790] I guess each time if I wanted to use it.
[00:35:27.790] 我想每次如果我想用它的话。
[00:35:30.070] And then I was like,
[00:35:30.070] 然后我就想，
[00:35:31.090] I'll have to make sure that I kind of squish it out flat.
[00:35:31.090] 我得确保把它压平。
[00:35:33.870] So it freezes quickly and melts quickly.
[00:35:33.870] 所以它结冰快，融化也快。
[00:35:37.290] All that stuff.
[00:35:37.290] 那些东西。
[00:35:38.210] And I like wrote the date.
[00:35:38.210] 我还写了日期。
[00:35:39.730] I was like,
[00:35:39.730] 我当时想，
[00:35:40.090] gotta make sure I'm responsible and like can't let the sit out a sit in the freezer for too long.
[00:35:40.090] 我得确保自己负责任，不能让它们在冰箱里或外面放太久。
[00:35:44.770] And after I finished doing that,
[00:35:44.770] 我做完那件事之后，
[00:35:46.710] I was like,
[00:35:46.710] 我当时想，
[00:35:47.130] wow,
[00:35:47.130] 哇，
[00:35:47.630] I'm truly an adult right now.
[00:35:47.630] 我现在真的算是个成年人了。
[00:35:51.270] I totally agree with this one,
[00:35:51.270] 我完全同意这一点。
[00:35:52.890] but I have like a exception.
[00:35:52.890] 但我有一个例外。
[00:35:55.670] I feel like freezing everything doesn't just automatically make you an adult because sometimes I will make too much rice and I'll freeze it.
[00:35:55.670] 我觉得把所有东西都冷冻起来并不能让你自动成为一个成年人，因为有时候我会煮太多米饭，然后把它冷冻起来。
[00:36:02.730] And then the rice will just like sit and rot in my freezer.
[00:36:02.730] 然后这些米饭就会一直放在我的冰箱里腐烂。
[00:36:06.110] And I'll just like toss it later and be like,
[00:36:06.110] 然后我之后就会把它扔掉，然后说，
[00:36:08.110] why,
[00:36:08.110] 为什么，
[00:36:08.290] why did I do that?
[00:36:08.290] 我为什么要那样做？
[00:36:09.710] Like,
[00:36:09.710] 喜欢，
[00:36:09.850] did I think I was going to eat that?
[00:36:09.850] 我当时以为我会吃掉它吗？
[00:36:11.330] Because I didn't.
[00:36:11.330] 因为我没有。
[00:36:15.070] So it has to be like you freeze it and then you use it.
[00:36:15.070] 所以必须先把它冷冻起来，然后再用。
[00:36:18.530] Yeah,
[00:36:18.530] 是的，
[00:36:18.970] exactly.
[00:36:18.970] 确切地。
[00:36:19.490] You have to execute,
[00:36:19.490] 你必须执行，
[00:36:21.110] you know,
[00:36:21.110] 你知道，
[00:36:22.970] you can't just ideate.
[00:36:22.970] 你不能只是空想。
[00:36:24.910] Yes.
[00:36:24.910] 是的。
[00:36:25.250] Yes.
[00:36:25.250] 是的。
[00:36:25.510] You're right.
[00:36:25.510] 你说得对。
[00:36:25.850] You're right.
[00:36:25.850] 你说得对。
[00:36:26.430] I do think portioning it out and putting the date on it though helps a lot because then when you look at it,
[00:36:26.430] 我确实认为把它分装好并标明日期很有帮助，因为这样当你看到它的时候，
[00:36:32.550] you're like,
[00:36:32.550] 你就像，
[00:36:33.230] oh my God,
[00:36:33.230] 我的天啊，
[00:36:33.610] I put this in almost a month ago.
[00:36:33.610] 我差不多一个月前就把它放进去了。
[00:36:35.650] Like I should probably eat it sooner than later.
[00:36:35.650] 我应该尽快把它吃掉。
[00:36:38.390] Right.
[00:36:38.390] 正确的。
[00:36:38.830] Right.
[00:36:38.830] 正确的。
[00:36:39.490] Damn.
[00:36:39.490] 该死。
[00:36:39.710] Actually,
[00:36:39.710] 实际上，
[00:36:40.530] this reminds me of another time where I looked at you and I was like,
[00:36:40.530] 这让我想起另一次，我看着你，当时我想：
[00:36:43.850] oh my God,
[00:36:43.850] 我的天啊，
[00:36:44.250] Crystal's a real adult.
[00:36:44.250] 克丽丝塔尔真是个大人了。
[00:36:46.050] It was like a long time ago.
[00:36:46.050] 感觉好像是很久以前的事了。
[00:36:47.890] We did a Tahoe cabin trip with a bunch of our friends.
[00:36:47.890] 我们和一群朋友一起去了太浩湖的小木屋度假。
[00:36:51.050] Yeah.
[00:36:51.050] 是的。
[00:36:51.570] And the dinner we were going to all cook and eat together was hot pot.
[00:36:51.570] 我们原本打算一起做、一起吃的晚餐是火锅。
[00:36:55.790] Yeah.
[00:36:55.790] 是的。
[00:36:56.290] So I was like,
[00:36:56.290] 所以我就想，
[00:36:57.170] oh,
[00:36:57.170] 哦，
[00:36:57.330] we'll probably go and get like a bunch of those,
[00:36:57.330] 我们可能会去买一大堆那种东西，
[00:36:59.450] you know,
[00:36:59.450] 你知道，
[00:37:00.050] meats that you can get from HBAR or Ranch 99.
[00:37:00.050] 您可以从 HBAR 或 Ranch 99 购买肉类。
[00:37:02.190] That's like specifically for hot pot.
[00:37:02.190] 那是专门为火锅准备的。
[00:37:04.130] And then I think you and another one of our friends suggested just getting like bulk meat
[00:37:04.130] 然后我想你和我们另一个朋友建议直接买散装肉。
[00:37:09.290] and slicing it using your meat slicer.
[00:37:09.290] 然后用切肉机把它切片。
[00:37:12.010] And we actually did that.
[00:37:12.010] 我们确实做到了。
[00:37:13.090] And I was like,
[00:37:13.090] 我当时就想，
[00:37:13.670] holy shit,
[00:37:13.670] 我的天哪！
[00:37:14.250] this is crazy.
[00:37:14.250] 这太疯狂了。
[00:37:15.810] We're fucking Bear Grills out here slicing our own meat.
[00:37:15.810] 我们他妈的就像贝尔·格里尔斯一样，自己动手切肉。
[00:37:20.510] Oh my God.
[00:37:20.510] 我的天啊。
[00:37:21.070] That was fun.
[00:37:21.070] 那真有趣。
[00:37:21.990] Yeah.
[00:37:21.990] 是的。
[00:37:22.230] That was me and Jimmy.
[00:37:22.230] 那是我和吉米。
[00:37:23.570] Jimmy had like a wholesale connect and we're like,
[00:37:23.570] 吉米好像有个批发渠道，我们当时就想，
[00:37:25.550] yeah,
[00:37:25.550] 是的，
[00:37:25.730] fuck it.
[00:37:25.730] 去他妈的。
[00:37:26.030] Let's do that.
[00:37:26.030] 那就这么做吧。
[00:37:27.450] Yeah.
[00:37:27.450] 是的。
[00:37:27.950] We made it work and it was pretty nice.
[00:37:27.950] 我们成功了，而且效果还不错。
[00:37:30.370] Yeah.
[00:37:30.370] 是的。
[00:37:31.130] Yeah.
[00:37:31.130] 是的。
[00:37:31.530] Yeah.
[00:37:31.530] 是的。
[00:37:31.670] And I feel like moments like that kind of inspired me too.
[00:37:31.670] 我觉得那样的时刻也给了我一些启发。
[00:37:34.070] Sometimes I'll go to the grocery store and I'll walk out with only ingredients,
[00:37:34.070] 有时我去超市，出来的时候只买了食材。
[00:37:37.830] you know,
[00:37:37.830] 你知道，
[00:37:38.230] like I didn't pick up a sweet treat.
[00:37:38.230] 就好像我没买甜点一样。
[00:37:39.930] Yeah.
[00:37:39.930] 是的。
[00:37:40.170] Like I didn't pick up any processed food,
[00:37:40.170] 好像我没买任何加工食品似的。
[00:37:42.090] nothing in like packaging.
[00:37:42.090] 包装方面没有任何问题。
[00:37:43.010] It's just like veggies and meat and fish or something.
[00:37:43.010] 就像蔬菜、肉类、鱼类之类的东西一样。
[00:37:45.930] And I'll be like,
[00:37:45.930] 然后我就会想，
[00:37:46.930] wow,
[00:37:46.930] 哇，
[00:37:47.290] this is it.
[00:37:47.290] 就是这样。
[00:37:48.570] That's like,
[00:37:48.570] 那就像，
[00:37:49.250] yeah,
[00:37:49.250] 是的，
[00:37:49.410] that's true adult.
[00:37:49.410] 那才像个真正的成年人。
[00:37:50.610] Right.
[00:37:50.610] 正确的。
[00:37:51.290] Whenever I buy like non frozen foods,
[00:37:51.290] 每当我买非冷冻食品的时候，
[00:37:53.650] I'm like,
[00:37:53.650] 我当时就想，
[00:37:54.150] oh yeah,
[00:37:54.150] 哦，是的。
[00:37:55.230] I'm a real person.
[00:37:55.230] 我是真人。
[00:37:56.810] Exactly.
[00:37:56.810] 确切地。
[00:37:57.550] This is farm to table,
[00:37:57.550] 这是从农场到餐桌的模式。
[00:37:58.830] baby.
[00:37:58.830] 婴儿。
[00:38:00.910] Exactly.
[00:38:00.910] 确切地。
[00:38:02.830] Honestly,
[00:38:02.830] 诚实地，
[00:38:03.530] shopping at Costco makes me feel adult like too.
[00:38:03.530] 在 Costco 购物也让我感觉自己像个大人了。
[00:38:06.730] Cause you need the membership and it's,
[00:38:06.730] 因为你需要会员资格，而且，
[00:38:09.070] it's just all stuff that like adults with real families would buy.
[00:38:09.070] 这些都是像真正有家庭的成年人会买的东西。
[00:38:12.570] That's true.
[00:38:12.570] 这是真的。
[00:38:13.570] But sometimes I get tempted by like the croissants or something.
[00:38:13.570] 但有时候我会忍不住想吃点东西，比如羊角面包之类的。
[00:38:16.390] And I'm like,
[00:38:16.390] 我当时就想，
[00:38:16.730] no,
[00:38:16.730] 不，
[00:38:17.430] don't buy this.
[00:38:17.430] 别买这个。
[00:38:18.650] Wait,
[00:38:18.650] 等待，
[00:38:18.950] don't worry.
[00:38:18.950] 不用担心。
[00:38:19.490] My dad loves buying the croissants and muffins and he's an adult.
[00:38:19.490] 我爸爸很喜欢买羊角面包和松饼，他可是个成年人啊。
[00:38:22.990] So it's acceptable.
[00:38:22.990] 所以这是可以接受的。
[00:38:25.430] Adult verified.
[00:38:25.430] 已验证为成人。
[00:38:26.770] Yeah.
[00:38:26.770] 是的。
[00:38:28.150] Well,
[00:38:28.150] 出色地，
[00:38:28.890] I'm glad that we're starting to really feel like we're adults now that we're
[00:38:28.890] 我很高兴我们现在开始真正觉得自己像个大人了。
[00:38:34.030] almost 30,
[00:38:34.030] 快30岁了，
[00:38:38.490] but it's really cool that we look at each other and we can recognize moments
[00:38:38.490] 但最酷的是，我们彼此对视，就能认出那些瞬间。
[00:38:43.090] where we're like,
[00:38:43.090] 我们现在的情况是这样的，
[00:38:43.890] wow,
[00:38:43.890] 哇，
[00:38:44.110] we've really like taken on responsibility and like owned up to whatever needs to
[00:38:44.110] 我们真的承担起了责任，并且对任何需要承担的责任都认清了。
[00:38:49.430] be done.
[00:38:49.430] 完成了。
[00:38:49.830] I think it's almost like a confidence booster chatting about how we've been able
[00:38:49.830] 我觉得聊聊我们如何能够做到这一点，就像是在增强自信心。
[00:38:54.690] to see ourselves more in those adult shoes and taking on responsibility,
[00:38:54.690] 让自己更多地扮演成年人的角色，承担起责任，
[00:39:00.010] whether we realize it or not.
[00:39:00.010] 无论我们是否意识到这一点。
[00:39:01.790] Maybe it just shows how prepared we're becoming for like the next steps in life.
