[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Jason. I'm Jeff. Welcome Jason and Jeff, couple of new faces for the podcast. We were actually introduced to you two through a mutual friend who was also on the podcast before,
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Jason。我是Jeff。欢迎Jason和Jeff，两位是播客的新面孔。我们其实是通过一位共同的朋友认识你们的，这位朋友之前也上过我们的播客。
[00:00:26.460] Eugene. He was on the episode about hinge dating. I think that was sometime last year. It was a great episode. So listeners, if you haven't checked it out, definitely take a listen. So Jason and Jeff are two filmmakers in LA. We thought it'd be awesome to talk about
[00:00:26.460] 尤金。他参加了关于Hinge约会的那期节目。我想那应该是去年某个时候。那期节目很棒。所以听众朋友们，如果你还没听过，一定要去听听。杰森和杰夫是洛杉矶的两位电影制作人。我们觉得聊聊他们的故事会很有意思。
[00:00:41.980] their latest project and also just kind of that filmmaker life out in LA. Yeah, I've been doing film for quite a long time. I've been always interested in it since I was like a kid. Started when I was like 13. I was like really fascinated with anime.
[00:00:41.980] 他们的最新项目，以及我在洛杉矶的电影人生活。是的，我从事电影行业已经很久了。我从小就对电影很感兴趣，大概13岁就开始了。我当时特别迷恋动漫。
[00:00:56.860] So I made this thing called like anime music videos. Oh my god. Oh, did you guys watch anime music videos? Is it like the Maple Story clips? I also made Maple Story clips. It's exactly like that. So I was really into like 90s hip hop. So
[00:00:56.860] 所以我做了一种叫动漫音乐视频的东西。我的天哪。你们看过动漫音乐视频吗？是不是像冒险岛的片段那样？我也做过冒险岛的片段。就是那种感觉。我当时特别喜欢90年代的嘻哈音乐。
[00:01:10.540] I'd like take Tupac songs and put it next to Naruto, put it on YouTube. And that's kind of how I got started. And I was basically the video kid all the way throughout high school. When I
[00:01:10.540] 我想把图帕克的歌和《火影忍者》的配乐放在一起，然后上传到YouTube。我就是这么入行的。整个高中时期，我基本上都是个视频达人。
[00:01:19.340] turned 18, I was like, oh, I'm going to be famous on YouTube. So I started applying for like jobs on Craigslist of all places. And I found an ad. The ad said must be Asian, must have camera,
[00:01:19.340] 我18岁的时候，就想，哦，我要在YouTube上出名。于是，我竟然开始在Craigslist这种地方找工作。然后我看到了一则广告。广告上说必须是亚洲人，必须有相机。
[00:01:30.380] must like Asian food. And it was for the Fun Brothers. That was like my first job out of high school. That's actually how I met Jason. Because Jason was a music video director at that time. He
[00:01:30.380] 他肯定喜欢亚洲菜。那是为Fun Brothers乐队做的。那是我高中毕业后的第一份工作。我就是在那份工作上认识了Jason。因为Jason当时是音乐录影带导演。
[00:01:39.580] did like some of Fun Brothers big music videos, 626, Boba Life, am I correct? And I was like PA. There's one music video that Jason, I think that's the first music video that I met Jason on.
[00:01:39.580] 我当时很喜欢Fun Brothers的一些热门MV，比如《626》和《Boba Life》，对吧？我当时就想，PA。我记得有一支MV里有Jason，我想那是我第一次见到Jason。
[00:01:49.820] He wasn't directing. I think you were gaffing. I had the twerk in a panda costume. That was like my first set experience. They're like, put on this panda costume and twerk. And
[00:01:49.820] 他没当导演。我觉得你是灯光师。我穿着熊猫服跳了个电臀舞。那是我第一次拍戏。他们就说，穿上这身熊猫服，跳个电臀舞。
[00:01:58.780] I was like, I didn't even know what twerk meant at that time. So I just danced. And I was like, oh, this is film life here in LA, I guess. Welcome to YouTube. Especially that era of YouTube was like a lot of absurdity.
[00:01:58.780] 我当时根本不知道“twerk”是什么意思，就跟着跳了起来。然后我就想，哦，这就是洛杉矶的电影圈生活吧。欢迎来到YouTube。尤其是那个年代的YouTube，简直荒诞至极。
[00:02:11.820] That's so interesting. I feel like anime music videos and like Maple Story music videos were such a huge thing back in our childhood. I remember I used to watch some I like started
[00:02:11.820] 真有意思。我觉得动漫音乐视频，还有像冒险岛这样的游戏音乐视频，在我们小时候可是风靡一时。我记得我以前经常看一些我喜欢的动画。
[00:02:22.060] to learn how to make some of them too. And I was like, this is way more complicated than it seems. So that's so funny that that was like the start of your interest into filmmaking. Did you ever upload any? Like, are they still available somewhere?
[00:02:22.060] 我也想学学怎么拍这些短片。然后我就想，这比看起来复杂多了。所以，你对电影制作的兴趣竟然是从那时开始的，真是太有意思了。你上传过这些短片吗？它们现在还能在哪里找到？
[00:02:36.060] No, I think I uploaded one to show some friends. And then after a while, I was like, I should wipe this from the internet. Wait, I'm so curious. What did you upload a video of you lip singing? Or was it like clips of a TV show or something?
[00:02:36.060] 不，我想我上传了一个视频给朋友们看。过了一段时间，我就想，我应该把它从网上删掉。等等，我很好奇。你上传的是自己对口型唱歌的视频吗？还是电视节目的片段之类的？
[00:02:50.140] Oh, it was like a Maple Story one. So I literally made it look like the Maple Story character was singing. Like I made their mouth movements and all that and like move their arms around.
[00:02:50.140] 哦，就像是《冒险岛》里的那种。所以我真的就让它看起来像《冒险岛》里的角色在唱歌。我做了他们的嘴型，还做了他们的手臂动作等等。
[00:03:04.060] I'm impressed. Honestly, I think back in high school, actually, a lot of like school projects were also music videos. We did like a music video for AP lit and then like a bunch of other
[00:03:04.060] 我印象深刻。说实话，我觉得高中时，很多学校作业其实也是音乐视频。比如我们为AP文学课做了一个音乐视频，然后还做了其他一些类似的。
[00:03:14.220] science classes we would like lip sync to a video or something like that. So I feel like that was a music video crazy time. Man, this is a good segue back to Eugene. One of the reasons why I love Eugene is I
[00:03:14.220] 科学课上，我们可能会对着视频对口型什么的。所以我觉得那段时间简直是音乐视频的狂热时期。哎，这正好引出了尤金的话题。我喜欢尤金的原因之一是……
[00:03:25.260] remember he had a school video project in high school where he, the song was chemist with an attitude. It was the NWA song, but it was all like chemistry oriented. Oh my god. I'm like, that's such a lost period of our childhood when we were doing cringy parodies
[00:03:25.260] 记得他高中时有个学校的视频项目，他配的歌是《一个态度很差的化学家》。歌是NWA的，但内容全是关于化学的。我的天哪。我就想，那段我们小时候做那些尴尬的恶搞视频的日子真是太可惜了。
[00:03:40.060] for school projects. Like I bet everybody has like a cringy school video project in their archive somewhere. For sure. Thinking back though, I'm also like, why did they even make us do video projects?
[00:03:40.060] 学校作业嘛。我敢打赌，每个人档案里肯定都存着一些尴尬的学校视频作业。真的。不过现在想想，我也在想，他们当初为什么要让我们做视频作业呢？
[00:03:50.620] We had no intro to like using any of the video software and like not all video software is free. So I don't know what they were expecting from us. That's true. They must have been like, your kids, you'll get it. You guys got computers, you know?
[00:03:50.620] 我们之前完全没有接受过任何视频软件的使用培训，而且也不是所有视频软件都是免费的。所以我不知道他们到底对我们有什么期望。确实如此。他们可能觉得，你们这些孩子，肯定能学会。你们家里有电脑，对吧？
[00:04:05.100] It's really funny because I'm like 10 years older than Jeff. And so when I was in this version of what you guys are describing in high school, no one else was doing it. Not too many people
[00:04:05.100] 这真的很有意思，因为我比杰夫大十岁左右。所以，当我还在高中经历你们描述的那种情况时，根本没人这么做。没多少人这么做。
[00:04:15.580] have video cameras in general. And the process of having a camera and putting it onto your computer was a very complicated process. I did do that stuff in high school, but it was very rare at the time. And that's kind of what got me into like filmmaking.
[00:04:15.580] 当时人们普遍都有摄像机。把摄像机拍下来，再把视频导入电脑，这个过程非常复杂。我高中时也做过类似的事情，但那时这种情况非常罕见。也正是这件事让我对电影制作产生了兴趣。
[00:04:26.780] And so it's kind of funny that I think about now a lot of YouTubers even in high school, they're actually very skilled at creating video. They have so many technical skills, shooting. I'm seeing these tutorials, these really advanced tutorials, and I'm looking at them
[00:04:26.780] 所以我觉得挺有意思的，现在很多YouTube博主，甚至高中生，他们的视频制作技巧都非常娴熟。他们掌握了很多技术，比如拍摄技巧。我看到很多教程，非常专业的教程，我一直在看。
[00:04:39.260] and I'm like, are you in high school or college? This is like really good content. And you seem very knowledgeable and technical. I feel like it gets even crazier too when you see people on TikTok do the transitions and stuff.
[00:04:39.260] 我当时就想，你是高中生还是大学生？这内容真的太棒了。而且你看起来知识渊博，技术也很娴熟。我觉得在TikTok上看到那些转场之类的视频，简直太疯狂了。
[00:04:51.260] Because they'll do it for like 40 seconds. They're filming the whole thing in 40 seconds, but you look at the actual outcome of it and it's like a crazy video with so many different filters and transitions. And I'm like, how are they planning this? It's like they already know how
[00:04:51.260] 因为他们只会用大概40秒的时间来完成。他们用40秒的时间拍摄整个过程，但你看最终的成品，却是一个加了各种滤镜和转场的炫酷视频。我就想，他们是怎么策划的？感觉他们好像早就知道该怎么做了。
[00:05:05.260] to use the software and it's baked into their brain. Otherwise, it would be impossible to make a video like that so quickly. I met someone that did a lot of that type of work. And it was funny because when
[00:05:05.260] 使用软件对他们来说就像是与生俱来的本能。否则，不可能这么快就制作出这样的视频。我认识一个经常做这类工作的人。有趣的是，当……
[00:05:14.460] she was describing video, she was saying, I don't even know how to use a real camera. That's like too complicated for me. But the phone is her tool and she's an expert at that tool or TikTok specifically. So that was kind of crazy hearing that.
[00:05:14.460] 她当时在描述视频拍摄，她说：“我甚至不知道怎么用真正的相机。那对我来说太复杂了。”但手机是她的工具，而且她很擅长使用手机，或者更确切地说，是TikTok。所以听到这些话，感觉有点不可思议。
[00:05:28.380] Yeah. I guess that makes so much sense because our phone cameras are so powerful now. Sometimes my parents will ask like, oh, didn't you have that old DSLR or something? Why don't you use that to take photos? And I'm like,
[00:05:28.380] 是啊。我觉得这很有道理，因为现在手机的摄像头功能太强大了。有时候我爸妈会问，哎，你以前不是有台单反相机吗？为什么不用它拍照呢？我就说，
[00:05:41.740] our phones are basically more powerful than whatever DSLR I bought like 10, 15 years ago. So true. So then for you, Jason, since you had way less video exposure or just like random video projects
[00:05:41.740] 我们现在的手机基本上比我十年前、十五年前买的单反相机还要强大。确实如此。所以，杰森，你之前接触的视频少得多，或者只是偶尔拍拍视频，所以你的情况可能不太一样。
[00:05:57.180] from school, what was maybe like the spark that got you interested into video production or just like video editing? I remember I had a friend who was a handful of years older, but he was really techie.
[00:05:57.180] 在学校里，是什么让你对视频制作或者视频剪辑产生了兴趣？我记得我有个朋友比我大几岁，但他非常懂技术。
[00:06:08.460] And I remember this is probably, I don't remember when this year it was, but this is over 20 years ago. And I remember just being a little kid and him showing me a video that he made.
[00:06:08.460] 我记得大概是，我不记得具体是哪一年了，但肯定超过20年了。我记得当时我还是个小孩子，他给我看了一段他自己制作的视频。
[00:06:17.660] And this is on probably some very, very early version of Adobe Premiere. I don't even know how he figured out how to do it. And if someone saw this video today, they would think it's just
[00:06:17.660] 而且这很可能是用非常非常早期的Adobe Premiere版本做的。我甚至不知道他是怎么做到的。如果今天有人看到这段视频，他们肯定会觉得这只是……
[00:06:25.660] completely like home video trash. But to me, him editing people, having video images of people I knew completely kind of removed the current of filmmaking. And it opened the idea that it's actually possible. I think before that moment, I never thought that making videos or anything like
[00:06:25.660] 完全就像家庭录像垃圾。但对我来说，他剪辑人们的视频，用我认识的人的影像，彻底颠覆了电影制作的传统模式。这让我意识到，这其实是可能的。我想在那之前，我从未想过制作视频或者类似的东西。
[00:06:42.780] that was even possible. It was like some distant reality. And I think once that was implanted in my mind, I couldn't get out of it. And I had a friend who had a video camera and we would run
[00:06:42.780] 那竟然是可能的。就像遥远的现实一样。我想一旦这种想法植入我的脑海，我就无法摆脱它了。我有个朋友有台摄像机，我们会跑来跑去
[00:06:50.540] around and shoot videos and he would edit on his VCR. For those of you who know what that is, he would edit the videos on his VCR. I didn't know how to do that. And then it wasn't until
[00:06:50.540] 他到处拍摄视频，然后用录像机剪辑。如果你知道录像机是什么，他就是用它来剪辑视频的。我当时不会。直到后来……
[00:06:59.980] I got a little older, got a video camera, we started shooting stuff. And that was kind of the spark. It was around high school when I got into it. And from there, I couldn't let it go.
[00:06:59.980] 我年纪稍长一些，买了台摄像机，就开始拍摄一些东西。那算是我的起点。我大概是在高中时期开始接触摄影的。从那时起，我就再也放不下它了。
[00:07:09.740] It's too much fun. Dude, that's crazy. How do you even edit on VCR? I had the same thought. So I think he had two VCR. I don't know how it exactly works. But you have your video camera
[00:07:09.740] 太好玩了。老兄，这太疯狂了。录像机怎么剪辑啊？我也想过这个问题。所以我猜他用了两台录像机。我不太清楚具体怎么操作。不过你得用摄像机。
[00:07:21.660] connected to the VCR. And then you push record on the VCR and then it basically records whatever's on the TV. And so then he would go to the camera and fast forward or rewind to a different part
[00:07:21.660] 连接到录像机。然后按下录像机的录制键，它就会录制电视上的所有内容。之后他会走到摄像机前，快进或倒退到不同的部分。
[00:07:33.420] and then push play. And then he would push record. So it was a very manual process. And so based off how he recorded, if he messed up, he has to rewind on the VCR and then re-record
[00:07:33.420] 然后按下播放键。接着他再按下录制键。所以整个过程都是手动操作。因此，根据他的录制方式，如果出错，他就得倒带重录。
[00:07:43.180] that part. Dang. Oh my god. Yeah, I was thinking about it. I was like, okay, I know how to record over old film on VCR. But that sounds extremely complicated. Very tedious. But that's all we knew
[00:07:43.180] 那部分。哎呀。我的天。是啊，我当时也在想这个问题。我想，好吧，我知道怎么用录像机覆盖旧胶片。但这听起来极其复杂。非常繁琐。但我们当时只知道这些。
[00:07:55.660] at the time. I mean, I didn't know. I didn't even know how to do it. But he was doing it. He would cut something that we had shot. You know, I don't know how long it would take him. But he'd just be
[00:07:55.660] 当时，我的意思是，我不知道。我甚至不知道该怎么做。但他确实在做。他会剪掉我们拍好的一些素材。你知道，我不知道他要花多长时间。但他就是会……
[00:08:02.060] doing it for hours. And it was pretty, it was pretty nuts. Wow. Would he like screen things for his friends at home? Like after you made the video, what happened to it? It was really just for
[00:08:02.060] 他做了好几个小时。而且挺不错的，也挺疯狂的。哇。他会想把一些东西放给家里的朋友们看吗？比如，你拍完视频之后，视频后来怎么样了？其实只是为了……
[00:08:10.700] us. I think there might have been a time when we would show it to people. But it was really just to show each other and we'd go to each other's houses and watch it. And that was it. Dang, that's
[00:08:10.700] 我们俩。我想可能曾经有一段时间我们会放给别人看。但其实只是我们自己看，我们会去对方家里一起看。仅此而已。哎，真是……
[00:08:19.180] so cool. At that point, it's like truly a dedication to the craft. We didn't know better. So that was actually kind of normal. It was almost the same way people might treat Minecraft or anything today. It's just something they would do like people who build these insane Minecraft
[00:08:19.180] 太酷了。那时候，这简直就是对技艺的真正奉献。我们当时不懂事，所以那其实很正常。这几乎和人们今天对待《我的世界》或其他任何东西的方式一样。就像那些建造出令人惊叹的《我的世界》作品的人一样。
[00:08:33.420] buildings. That was I guess our version of you know, we're just kids spending time making stupid videos. But that's what it was. Man, I want to hear in Jason, you don't have to tell us but
[00:08:33.420] 建筑物。我想，这就是我们理解的“我们只是几个孩子花时间拍些傻视频”吧。但事实就是如此。伙计，我想听听杰森怎么说，你不用告诉我们，但是
[00:08:43.420] I'm like super curious about the time you went viral. And I don't even know the story yet. Which what? What are you referring to? Is this? I heard from Nate that you did some type of lip sync
[00:08:43.420] 我对你的那次爆红经历超级好奇。我甚至都不知道是怎么回事。什么？你指的是什么？是这个吗？我听内特说你当时做了个对口型表演。
[00:08:54.780] video that went viral before like YouTube was a thing. Oh, do tell. So pre YouTube, people would just pass videos on the internet, there would be websites or I don't even remember the websites,
[00:08:54.780] 在YouTube出现之前，有哪些视频会爆红？哦，快说说。在YouTube出现之前，人们会在网上分享视频，当时有一些网站，或者我甚至都不记得是什么网站了。
[00:09:05.260] but there would be different websites you can download. Or there was another thing called IRC. And essentially, it's a database that you have to like put in codes and then download the videos
[00:09:05.260] 但你可以下载不同的网站。或者还有一种叫IRC的东西。本质上，它是一个数据库，你需要输入代码，然后才能下载视频。
[00:09:14.620] manually. And you can kind of search for stuff there. Maybe like kind of the pre torrent era, so to speak, but I wouldn't say it was that viral. But I basically did a lip sync video
[00:09:14.620] 手动操作。你可以在那里搜索一些东西。大概算是BT下载出现之前的时代吧，但我不会说它当时很火。我当时做了一个对口型视频。
[00:09:24.780] that went viral. But I put a little twist to it where because I had some basic video editing skills, I would crop myself and then I did multi cam type of thing where it'd be like me doing one part,
[00:09:24.780] 那段视频火了。但我做了一些改动，因为我有一些基本的视频剪辑技巧，所以我会把自己的镜头裁剪掉，然后我做了多机位拍摄的效果，就像是我拍一部分，
[00:09:36.540] me doing one part and then me doing another part. And it was a very like shitty version of this edit thing. But at the time, people were just doing it on like a webcam. Whereas I was
[00:09:36.540] 我先录一部分，然后录另一部分。剪辑出来的效果很差劲。但当时，大家都是用网络摄像头录的。而我呢……
[00:09:44.780] actually trying to put some video editing technique into it. My friend always jokes, he said, you were doing TikTok 20 years before TikTok. If you kept going with it, you could be a billionaire
[00:09:44.780] 其实我正尝试在视频里加入一些剪辑技巧。我朋友总是开玩笑说，你在TikTok出现20年前就开始玩TikTok了。如果你坚持下去，现在都能成为亿万富翁了。
[00:09:54.220] I mean, yeah, I feel like that was super ahead of its time. Like that kind of reminds me of back in the day when YouTube covers were huge. Like people pretty much did that kind of edit for
[00:09:54.220] 我的意思是，没错，我觉得这真的非常超前。这让我想起了以前YouTube翻唱很火的年代。那时候人们几乎都会做这种剪辑。
[00:10:05.420] their covers. Someone's playing the guitar and then they cut right you know, someone playing the piano and then all the people harmonizing and all that kind of stuff. So this is a very inventive
[00:10:05.420] 他们的翻唱。有人弹吉他，然后镜头切到有人弹钢琴，接着所有人一起和声等等。所以这是一种非常有创意的翻唱方式。
[00:10:15.180] I'm impressed. I'm like, I think I'm like, man, I thought that before YouTube was even invented. That's kind of crazy. Yeah. You kind of like predicted the future. Actually, that's kind of
[00:10:15.180] 我挺佩服的。我当时就想，天哪，我居然在YouTube发明之前就想到这一点了。这简直太疯狂了。是啊，你好像预言了未来。实际上，这有点……
[00:10:23.580] that is wild. I feel like stuff only if only your video to be honest should be in a museum. Like I would see it. I would want to go to a museum where it has videos that are like dated like this.
[00:10:23.580] 太疯狂了。说实话，我觉得只有你的视频才应该被博物馆收藏。我肯定会去看。我真想去一个专门收藏这种年代久远的视频的博物馆。
[00:10:34.700] I did a lip sync to Jessica Simpsons. I want to love you forever. And I think the the just the position of an Asian guy singing that at the time I think was really absurd and
[00:10:34.700] 我当时对口型唱了杰西卡·辛普森的《我想永远爱你》。我觉得当时一个亚裔男生唱这首歌的姿势真的很荒谬。
[00:10:43.900] weird and unexpected. I think that was part of the the viral draw. Maybe song choice is amazing. That's so sick. It's like that reminds me of like, do you all remember the viral like,
[00:10:43.900] 真是奇怪又出乎意料。我觉得这就是它爆红的原因之一。也许是选歌太棒了。太酷了。这让我想起了……你们还记得那个爆红的……
[00:10:55.420] I think it was also a lip sync video. He's like Asian guys doing Backstreet Boys and they were like dancing to it. And that one went really viral. I think towards the beginning of YouTube. I remember you're like in like one small college dorm room or something, right?
[00:10:55.420] 我觉得那也是个对口型视频。他让几个亚洲男生模仿后街男孩的歌，然后他们就跟着跳舞。那个视频当时特别火。我记得好像是YouTube刚兴起的时候。我记得你当时好像是在大学宿舍里拍的，对吧？
[00:11:10.780] Exactly. Yeah, there was a group called the bok choy boys that did something like that they would do either covers or they would do think parodies of those songs. And it was like a bunch of Asian
[00:11:10.780] 没错。是啊，有个叫“白菜男孩”的组合也干过类似的事情，他们要么翻唱那些歌，要么做些戏仿之类的改编。而且他们好像是一群亚洲人。
[00:11:20.940] guys. Yeah, I feel like there are so many gyms. Yeah, during the early internet because everyone's like, Oh, well, I guess I can just like put up just random shit that comes to my mind. I mean,
[00:11:20.940] 伙计们。是啊，我觉得健身房真的太多了。是啊，在互联网早期，因为大家都会想，哦，好吧，我想我可以随便上传一些我脑子里想到的东西。我的意思是，
[00:11:32.220] I think the origin of Ryan Higa is just that he put videos on YouTube because he was trying to show his family and then he was like, Oh, wait, actually the whole world can see this like,
[00:11:32.220] 我认为 Ryan Higa 的起源就是他最初把视频上传到 YouTube，因为他想给家人看，然后他突然意识到，哦，等等，实际上全世界都能看到这些视频。
[00:11:41.420] oh my bad. But now I feel like there's way more rules in filmmaking almost TikTok even YouTube, YouTube shorts. It's always like, what kind of content are you creating? So YouTube is almost more reserved for like, super high quality, independent filmmakers who are making
[00:11:41.420] 哦，我的错。但现在我觉得电影制作的规则比TikTok甚至YouTube Shorts都多得多。总是有人问：你在创作什么类型的内容？所以YouTube似乎更适合那些制作高质量独立电影的创作者。
[00:12:00.540] super high quality stuff that are almost like documentary or movie level. And then TikTok is like really fast paced and a little more casual, but like gimmicky almost in some ways, like the transitions that we talked about. So I feel like nowadays in terms of that, like insane
[00:12:00.540] 质量超高，几乎达到了纪录片或电影的水平。而TikTok节奏很快，更随意一些，但在某些方面又有点噱头，比如我们之前提到的转场效果。所以我觉得现在在这方面，简直太疯狂了。
[00:12:16.940] weirdness and like creativity, it's kind of gone down in a sense, but it's still very interesting to see how quality overall has like improved. Super impressive. I just feel some of the content
[00:12:16.940] 怪诞感和创造力在某种程度上有所下降，但看到整体质量的提升仍然非常有趣。令人印象深刻。我只是觉得有些内容
[00:12:29.660] I see from really young people, I would, I could never at their ages is insane quality. And I'm so impressed by some of the stuff that I see. Yeah. Hey, don't discount yourself. You're a
[00:12:29.660] 我看到一些非常年轻的人，他们的水平简直令人难以置信，我这个年纪绝对做不到。我看到的一些作品真的让我印象深刻。是啊。嘿，别妄自菲薄。你很棒。
[00:12:40.380] visionary. True. I think video must be like a second language to kids, you know, like iPad kids just grew up watching video. They probably watch videos before they can read or write. It's true.
[00:12:40.380] 真有远见。没错。我觉得视频对孩子们来说就像第二语言一样，你知道，就像那些用iPad长大的孩子，他们可能在学会读写之前就已经在看视频了。确实如此。
[00:12:52.940] It makes me wonder though, because I guess back when content and like creation wasn't as easy to do. I feel like a lot of the times we were kind of walking around observing life, right? And then
[00:12:52.940] 不过这让我不禁思考，因为我觉得以前创作内容和点赞并不容易。很多时候，我们就像是在四处走走，观察生活，对吧？
[00:13:04.780] whatever you wanted to put into the camera was things that you maybe observed about life and thought was interesting enough to kind of rewatch later. But it's interesting because if TikTok is so easy for kids to pick up, especially, and that's something that they're constantly on,
[00:13:04.780] 你想录进镜头的，可能是你观察到的生活点滴，你觉得它们很有趣，值得以后再看。但有趣的是，TikTok 对孩子们来说很容易上手，尤其是他们经常使用，
[00:13:20.300] then our creators that are kind of younger and born into that TikTok era, like do they kind of have that TikTok mindset when it comes to creating stuff? So like, are they maybe more thinking like,
[00:13:20.300] 那么，那些年纪较轻、出生于TikTok时代的创作者们，他们在创作内容时是否也带有TikTok的思维模式呢？比如说，他们是不是更多地会这样想：
[00:13:32.220] oh, I saw that this went viral. So I'm thinking in ways that will make something go viral versus maybe back then we were kind of thinking like, the world is so beautiful and not to over idealize the
[00:13:32.220] 哦，我看到这个火了。所以我在思考如何让东西火起来，而不是像以前那样，觉得世界很美好，不要过度理想化。
[00:13:43.020] past, but truly it was kind of more like we were immersed in the world rather than like real life being half of our real lives. Like now the digital world is so real as well.
[00:13:43.020] 过去的确如此，但实际上，那时我们更像是沉浸在虚拟世界中，而不是现实生活只占我们现实生活的一半。就像现在，数字世界也变得如此真实。
[00:13:53.020] This kind of goes into my own film journey. Like I mentioned to you guys on the pre-call that I'm focusing on fashion now and other stuff. And after pursuing video professionally for 10, 12
[00:13:53.020] 这其实也算是我自己的电影之路的一部分。就像我在之前的电话会议上跟你们提到的，我现在专注于时尚和其他领域。在从事专业视频制作10到12年之后，我又重新开始了。
[00:14:02.780] years, I got pretty burnt out and it wasn't even a conscious burnout. It was very subconscious. And I was relatively happy in my journey, but it wasn't until the pandemic where things kind of stopped and I had time to reflect. And I realized that it wasn't something that
[00:14:02.780] 多年来，我筋疲力尽，而且这甚至不是有意识的倦怠，而是潜意识的。我之前对自己的事业发展还算满意，但直到疫情爆发，一切停滞不前，我才有时间反思。我意识到，这并不是什么……
[00:14:16.540] I still loved it and I was still happy about doing it, but there was something about it that I felt really tired from. And I think it was maybe the next step of what you're describing,
[00:14:16.540] 我仍然热爱这份工作，也仍然乐在其中，但不知为何，我总觉得很疲惫。我想，这或许就是你所描述的下一步吧。
[00:14:27.180] where people are thinking about audience and content and reception and virality as one of the main drivers for how they create. And I think for myself, my version of that was a sustainable working video career and job. And so all the art I created, the video I created
[00:14:27.180] 人们开始将受众、内容、反响和病毒式传播视为创作的主要驱动力之一。而对我来说，我的版本就是一份可持续的视频工作和事业。因此，我创作的所有艺术作品和视频都源于此。
[00:14:42.940] was with how to make money at top of mind. And I lost the joy of why I was creating. And I was having a hard time to blend. I think the people who are very successful can kind of blend both
[00:14:42.940] 我满脑子想的都是如何赚钱，却失去了创作的乐趣，很难将两者融合起来。我认为真正成功的人能够很好地平衡这两者。
[00:14:54.540] really well, where they're able to please a client and make money and generate something that somebody wants, but also enjoy that process where I was really just trying to do what I thought
[00:14:54.540] 做得非常好，他们既能取悦客户，又能赚钱，还能创造出别人想要的东西，同时还能享受这个过程，而我当时只是尽力去做我想做的事。
[00:15:04.540] other people wanted to do. And I felt really tired. I think even a way that with filmmaking, I think it's already difficult enough to become a person that makes movies in theaters. I only
[00:15:04.540] 其他人想做的事。我感觉真的很累。我觉得即使是拍电影，能成为一个在影院上映电影的人，就已经够难的了。我只是
[00:15:14.140] know one person that I know who wasn't that, and that actually became that out of hundreds of filmmakers that I've met, specifically as a director, maybe in other positions I've seen that happen, but someone that's like a nobody that becomes a director that's making movies
[00:15:14.140] 在我认识的数百位电影人中，我只认识一个例外，他原本不是那样的人，却最终成为了导演。我认识的电影人很多，尤其是导演，或许在其他岗位上我也见过类似的例子，但真正能做到这一点的，是一个默默无闻的人，最终却成为了一名电影导演。
[00:15:27.180] that's in theaters is really, really rare. And so just that is already difficult enough, but to have that whole journey and process where I feel that I'm just giving and giving without actually doing anything that I enjoy, I think really drained me and it wasn't sustainable in
[00:15:27.180] 能在影院上映的电影真的非常非常少见。光是这一点就已经够难了，更何况整个过程我都感觉自己一直在付出，却没做任何自己喜欢的事情，这真的让我精疲力竭，而且这种状态也无法持续下去。
[00:15:40.460] the long run. And so I feel like as I'm coming back to it, and even with this project, I do feel that sense of meaning, joy, doing something that I like. I actually feel like I'm growing and this journey
[00:15:40.460] 从长远来看。所以我觉得，当我重新投入其中，即使是参与这个项目，我仍然能感受到那种意义和喜悦，做着自己喜欢的事情。我感觉自己真的在成长，在这段旅程中不断进步。
[00:15:53.260] is teaching me a lot about myself, but also stretching the boundaries of how I create. That's really fun. So interesting, dude. I feel like what you also talk about and Jisoo's question, how I'm thinking about it in my head is
[00:15:53.260] 它让我更了解自己，也拓展了我的创作边界。这真的很有趣。太有意思了，兄弟。我觉得你说的和Jisoo的问题，我脑子里想的也是这样：
[00:16:07.580] there's the larger question of how we reckon with turning our passion into a commodity, into something that is a part of the capitalistic system and has to be exchangeable for value, which is very wildly different than why we got into our passions in the first place. And that
[00:16:07.580] 还有一个更大的问题，那就是我们如何看待将我们的热情转化为商品，转化为资本主义体系的一部分，并使其能够交换价值——这与我们最初投身于这些爱好的原因截然不同。
[00:16:23.900] kind of disorientation or conflict in thought is difficult for everybody to reckon with. And I feel like it's interesting thinking about, back to Jisoo's questions about kids and TikTok,
[00:16:23.900] 这种迷失方向或思维冲突是每个人都难以应对的。我觉得思考这个问题很有意思，回到Jisoo关于孩子和TikTok的问题上来。
[00:16:35.260] I think most kids say they want to be a YouTuber as their job now when they grow up, which is so interesting, right? But I think that goes to show you that it's also a career that people recognize
[00:16:35.260] 我觉得现在很多孩子都说长大后想当YouTuber，这很有意思，对吧？但这也说明，YouTuber也是一份被认可的职业。
[00:16:45.420] in the same way that, I don't know, there's college majors for eSports. That's such a good point. Back in our day, especially for us as children of immigrants or Asian Americans, the idea of doing something
[00:16:45.420] 就像，比如说，现在大学里有电子竞技专业一样。你说得太对了。在我们那个年代，尤其对我们这些移民子女或亚裔美国人来说，做点什么的想法很特别。
[00:16:58.220] that's not STEM is just so crazy. It's like, what do you mean you want to make videos for YouTube? What does that even mean, right? And now it's just such a regular thing. It's actually so crazy
[00:16:58.220] “这不是STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）”简直太疯狂了。就好像，你想在YouTube上做视频是什么意思？这到底是什么意思？对吧？而现在这却成了家常便饭。真是太不可思议了。
[00:17:09.660] because I've seen my parents refer to YouTube as a money-making avenue now as well. And I'm like, a money-making avenue now as well? And I'm like, where was this 10 years ago? Now it's like, oh,
[00:17:09.660] 因为我看到我父母现在也把YouTube当作赚钱的途径了。我就想，现在也变成赚钱的途径了？我就想，这在10年前怎么没出现呢？现在感觉就像，哦，
[00:17:26.460] these people are putting stuff on YouTube and making money. And I was like, okay, first of all, it's not that easy, but also... Are they telling you in the context of giving you advice?
[00:17:26.460] 这些人把东西上传到YouTube上赚钱。我就想，好吧，首先，这没那么容易，而且……他们是在给你建议的时候这么说的吗？
[00:17:37.340] I think they said one of their friends who likes to hike takes videos of their hikes and just puts it on YouTube or something. And they're like, yeah, if they get X amount of views,
[00:17:37.340] 我想他们说的是，他们有个朋友喜欢徒步旅行，会把徒步旅行的视频拍下来上传到YouTube之类的网站。然后他们就说，如果视频能获得X次观看，
[00:17:49.260] they'll get a little bit of money. So who knows if they get way more views? That's a lot of money, right? And I'm like, okay, yes. But also, it's not that easy. We've actually been watching YouTube
[00:17:49.260] 他们会赚点钱。谁知道呢，如果他们的视频点击量更高呢？那可是一大笔钱，对吧？我就想，好吧，确实如此。但同时，事情也没那么简单。我们一直在关注YouTube。
[00:18:01.340] growing up, but it feels like at least my parents are just discovering the potential of YouTube and just capitalist potential of virality. It's really funny because I remember around the time that Jeff and maybe even a little bit earlier,
[00:18:01.340] 虽然我父母也在成长，但感觉他们才刚刚发现 YouTube 的潜力，以及病毒式传播带来的资本主义潜力。这真的很有意思，因为我记得杰夫（Jeff）还在用 YouTube 的时候，甚至可能更早一些，
[00:18:17.580] that early, if you were watching a lot of Asian American YouTube during that late 2000s and early 2010s, YouTube kind of felt like a little bit of a ghetto where people who couldn't make it into
[00:18:17.580] 如果你在2000年代末和2010年代初经常观看亚裔美国人的YouTube视频，你会感觉YouTube有点像个贫民窟，那里聚集着那些无法进入主流社会的人们。
[00:18:27.260] quote unquote Hollywood, they all put their films and stuff in YouTube and it kind of blew up. And it was a self-sustaining kind of environment and ecosystem. And people, the musicians, Asian
[00:18:27.260] 所谓的“好莱坞”，他们都把电影之类的东西上传到YouTube，然后就火了。那形成了一种自我维持的环境和生态系统。还有人，音乐家，亚洲人。
[00:18:38.300] singers, songwriters were able to have a career where they could tour around the world just off of the fame that they got on the internet for it to kind of go in a place where now this ghetto is
[00:18:38.300] 歌手和词曲作者能够凭借在互联网上获得的知名度，开启他们的职业生涯，环游世界进行巡演，而如今，这种名气却演变成贫民窟。
[00:18:48.540] now the goal. It's kind of crazy when I think about it that way. It's kind of got gentrified, right? I mean, that's kind of what it is. And now it's like people see value in it and they want to
[00:18:48.540] 现在的目标。这么想起来有点疯狂。这里有点像高档化了，对吧？我的意思是，差不多就是这样。现在人们看到了它的价值，他们想要……
[00:18:59.260] buy a property here. It's true. Yeah, that's so crazy. YouTube is gentrified. That is a good way of putting it, though. Because now people come on YouTube, their first video is so well produced already or they're already hiring editors to help with thumbnail creation, video edits, all that
[00:18:59.260] 在这里买房吧。真的。是啊，太疯狂了。YouTube 都“高档化”了。这么说也挺贴切的。因为现在人们来到 YouTube，他们的第一个视频就已经制作得非常精良，或者他们已经开始雇佣剪辑师来帮忙制作缩略图、剪辑视频等等。
[00:19:19.740] kind of stuff. But just 10, 15 years ago, the first video on every channel is probably the grainiest, most jank video that they could come up with. And then you slowly see the progress of improvement. I will say that maybe the good part about seeing the platform grow, and maybe,
[00:19:19.740] 诸如此类的事情。但就在10到15年前，每个频道发布的第一个视频可能都是他们能做出来的最粗糙、最不清晰的。然后你慢慢地看到它不断改进。我想说，看到平台发展壮大的好处之一，或许就是，
[00:19:42.300] Jason, you can attest to this too, is that the genres have diversified. The type of content before on YouTube was like there's also still a type of genre, right? Like acoustic pop covers
[00:19:42.300] 杰森，你也可以证实这一点，那就是视频类型确实更加多元化了。以前YouTube上的内容类型比较单一，现在也仍然存在某种类型，对吧？比如原声流行翻唱。
[00:19:52.700] of Billboard Top 100 songs and so on and so forth. Or like Talking Heads where they just rant about a controversial opinion to camera. Me and Jason talk about cinematic vlogs being this really cool in-between of YouTube content and filmmaking. And I think if there's no YouTube,
[00:19:52.700] 比如Billboard百强单曲榜等等。或者像Talking Heads那样，对着镜头滔滔不绝地发表一些有争议的观点。我和Jason聊过，电影化的vlog是YouTube内容和电影制作之间一种很酷的过渡形式。而且我觉得如果没有YouTube，
[00:20:08.940] there wouldn't be this genre. And I feel like we both love that genre and like watching it. Do you guys remember when YouTube used to recap the whole year and have a basically get the top
[00:20:08.940] 如果没有这些视频，就不会有这种类型的视频了。我觉得我们俩都喜欢这种类型的视频，也都喜欢看。你们还记得YouTube以前会回顾一整年的视频，然后列出年度热门视频吗？
[00:20:18.140] YouTubers to do something? Yeah. One of the conversations I heard about that was now that it's expanded too much, and there's so many niches that have millions, potentially billions of views that they can't even fit all of them into one video because it doesn't even make sense because
[00:20:18.140] YouTuber们该做点什么吗？是的。我听到的一种说法是，现在YouTube发展得太快了，很多细分领域都有数百万甚至数十亿的观看量，他们甚至无法把所有内容都塞进一个视频里，因为这根本没意义。
[00:20:32.060] it's so wide at this point. Whereas before, it was kind of limited to America or North America and you have these top YouTubers that you can just pick and these 30 people are in the video. Now
[00:20:32.060] 现在范围太广了。以前，范围基本上仅限于美国或北美，你只能挑选一些顶级的 YouTuber，然后视频里就会出现这 30 个人。现在
[00:20:44.780] it's hundreds and hundreds of people and there's no way to actually create a recap because your version of YouTube may not even exist. And they may have billions of views but
[00:20:44.780] 人数成百上千，根本无法进行总结，因为你所在地区的 YouTube 可能根本不存在。而且他们的视频观看量可能高达数十亿，但
[00:20:53.500] you watch the video, you're like, I have no idea who 95% of these creators are. This makes no sense to me. Whereas before you kind of get to see this like a multiverse of YouTubers, and you kind of enjoy
[00:20:53.500] 你看完视频，会觉得：这些创作者95%我都不认识。这对我来说毫无意义。而以前，你看到的就像是一个多元宇宙的YouTube博主，你会觉得挺有意思的。
[00:21:02.780] that super collaboration. Where now it's just so wide that doesn't even make sense. Yeah, that's a really good point because I remember towards the end of those recaps, people kept complaining like
[00:21:02.780] 那种超级合作。现在范围太广了，简直莫名其妙。是啊，你说得很有道理，因为我记得在那些回顾视频的最后，人们一直在抱怨，就像……
[00:21:12.220] how could you have not included this YouTuber or that one or whatever? And then I feel like at the time it was such a like, oh my god, how could they not have put this person in? Now looking back,
[00:21:12.220] 你怎么能漏掉这个油管博主或者那个呢？当时我就觉得，天哪，他们怎么能没把这个人放进去？现在回想起来，
[00:21:23.820] it's like, okay yeah, it makes sense that this is what caused the downfall of those recaps and just the crazy expansion at like what felt like exponential timeline. Well it's still crazy that
[00:21:23.820] 好吧，确实，这解释了为什么那些回顾视频会衰落，以及为什么游戏会以指数级速度疯狂扩张。但即便如此，这仍然令人难以置信。
[00:21:35.020] YouTube's still here though. Like I feel like so many video platforms have come and gone and it's still kind of like where people end up. Well we also mentioned how thanks to YouTube and other
[00:21:35.020] 不过YouTube依然存在。感觉很多视频平台都来了又走了，但它仍然是人们最终会去的地方。我们也提到过，多亏了YouTube和其他平台。
[00:21:45.980] such platforms, there are just basically genres that might not even exist in the world today without these platforms. So some that you mentioned earlier, cinematic vlogging. Honestly like vlogging itself is kind of a platform-specific genre as well. And I feel like something else that will also
[00:21:45.980] 有了这些平台，很多类型的视频可能根本就不会存在。比如你之前提到的电影式vlog。说实话，vlog本身也算是一种平台专属的类型。我觉得还有一些其他类型也会……
[00:22:03.660] forever live on YouTube is music videos. So many different genres of music videos too. The anime music videos that Jeff made back in the day, the legitimate Hollywood production music videos that
[00:22:03.660] YouTube上永远播放的是音乐视频。而且音乐视频的类型也多种多样。有杰夫当年制作的动漫音乐视频，也有好莱坞出品的正规音乐视频。
[00:22:17.260] we get. And then also kind of tying into what we mentioned earlier, like how those Asian American artists were creating music and music videos on YouTube. So I guess to tie all that together,
[00:22:17.260] 我们明白了。而且，这也和我们之前提到的内容有点关联，比如那些亚裔美国艺术家如何在YouTube上创作音乐和音乐视频。所以我想把所有这些联系起来，
[00:22:32.300] it relates to the project that you two have been working on lately which is also a music video. So for this music video project, what is the biggest theme would you say? I think the main
[00:22:32.300] 这和你们俩最近一直在做的项目有关，那也是一个音乐视频项目。那么，对于这个音乐视频项目，你们觉得它最大的主题是什么？我认为主要的
[00:22:44.780] theme of this project is to explore the gray area of past relationships. It's easy to think about it in black or white, especially when there's painful breakups which I've experienced as well.
[00:22:44.780] 这个项目的主题是探索过往感情关系中的灰色地带。人们很容易用非黑即白的眼光看待感情，尤其是在经历过痛苦的分手之后，而我也曾有过这样的经历。
[00:22:55.100] I think at the end of the day, our more nuanced, me and Jason's perspective on relationships, the more nuanced perspective is that there really is no right or wrong. Sometimes it just doesn't work
[00:22:55.100] 我认为归根结底，我和杰森对感情的看法更加细致入微，那就是感情中其实没有绝对的对错之分。有时候，感情就是行不通。
[00:23:05.500] even if it was a good relationship. There might have still been love. There probably was love and it was real and it was tangible. But sometimes it just doesn't work and exploring
[00:23:05.500] 即使曾经有过一段美好的关系，也可能存在爱情。或许曾经有过真爱，而且是真真切切的。但有时候，感情就是行不通，需要不断探索。
[00:23:15.820] and having an audience for a couple that they like, but it doesn't necessarily work out in the end. But that's okay, I think is what we're trying to say with this film. I think one thing that we
[00:23:15.820] 观众们喜欢一对情侣，但最终他们的感情未必能走到最后。不过没关系，我觉得这就是我们想通过这部电影表达的。我认为我们想表达的一点是……
[00:23:25.820] touch on them in the music video is memories and how depending on our lens, we can judge the memories as a positive or negative thing. It becomes just a texture of the whole experience. We wanted to explore that idea throughout the project.
[00:23:25.820] 音乐录影带中触及的主题是回忆，以及我们如何根据视角来评判回忆的积极或消极意义。它最终成为整个体验的一部分。我们希望在整个项目中探索这一理念。
[00:23:39.660] Yeah, and I think one thought I have is the theme of your music video sounds very relatable and I feel like that's something that maybe is sometimes hard for really big production companies that are Hollywood machines to showcase or create. I feel like it's a big
[00:23:39.660] 是的，我觉得你的音乐录影带的主题非常贴近生活，而这似乎是好莱坞那些大型制作公司有时很难展现或创作出来的。我觉得这很重要。
[00:23:58.380] discourse lately that all these rich people, rich and famous people are super out of touch with just like us regular people. I think it's nice to see that smaller or independent filmmakers still explore these deeper themes and can show something that most people can relate to.
[00:23:58.380] 最近有很多言论认为，所有这些有钱人，那些有钱有名的人，都和我们普通人严重脱节。我觉得很高兴看到一些规模较小的独立电影人仍然在探索这些更深层次的主题，并能展现一些大多数人都能产生共鸣的作品。
[00:24:19.740] One thing that I think was special about this project was that the artist that funded the project, and it's essentially a passion project and he used his life savings to put this towards a video. He wanted to do something that represented the album, but the album was
[00:24:19.740] 我认为这个项目最特别之处在于，资助这个项目的艺术家，这本质上是一个出于热爱而创作的项目，他用自己的毕生积蓄来制作这部MV。他想创作一部能够代表专辑的作品，但专辑本身……
[00:24:33.980] a process of like seven years in the making and there were so many things that he wanted in it. He gave us a lot of creative freedom to kind of explore whatever we want to explore,
[00:24:33.980] 这个项目历时七年才完成，他想在里面加入很多东西。他给了我们很大的创作自由，让我们探索任何我们想探索的东西。
[00:24:43.180] translate the things that we received from his album into some sort of video. That relationship I think is fairly rare where most people have a lot of opinions or they want it a specific way, but he really gave us freedom to kind of explore
[00:24:43.180] 我们将从他的专辑中汲取的灵感转化成某种形式的视频。我认为这种合作关系相当难得，因为大多数人都会有很多意见，或者希望作品以某种特定的方式呈现，但他真的给了我们很大的自由去探索。
[00:24:57.500] and I think that's a pretty rare thing that definitely wouldn't happen, I think, with a traditional studio, especially if they've never put out any music. There's no way they would give a creative license to create whatever with the budget and all that. It almost feels like this
[00:24:57.500] 我觉得这种情况非常罕见，在传统录音室里肯定不会发生，尤其是在他们从未发行过任何音乐作品的情况下。他们不可能在预算有限的情况下给予创作自由。感觉就像这样。
[00:25:11.740] is something that would only exist on the internet with people who really have a belief and passion for whatever they're creating. For sure. This is truly independent. We basically worked without
[00:25:11.740] 这种东西只会存在于互联网上，存在于那些真正对自己的创作充满信念和热情的人心中。的确如此。这完全是独立的。我们基本上是独立创作的。
[00:25:21.740] a deadline. I mean, it was like whenever we felt good about it. We would spend sessions at our office and me and Jason would be like, I'm like, what's up with your love life, man? Tell me what's
[00:25:21.740] 有个截止日期。我的意思是，就像我们感觉一切都进展顺利的时候。我们会在办公室里开会，我和杰森会说，我会问他，哥们儿，你的感情生活怎么样了？跟我说说吧。
[00:25:32.780] going on. Tell me your history. We were already close, but I think through the project and working on this topic matter, we got even closer just sitting outside the little patio chairs. A lot of group therapy. Even for the artist too, Junsei, just getting to know about his...
[00:25:32.780] 继续。跟我说说你的经历吧。我们本来就很亲近，但我觉得通过这个项目，通过探讨这个话题，我们更加亲近了，哪怕只是坐在露台的小椅子上。就像是一次集体疗愈。对艺术家俊世来说也是如此，了解他的故事……
[00:25:49.340] I mean, the original name of the album was Love Story. So it was just like a matter of exploring each other's past history and trying to come away with new thoughts and feelings about it. And
[00:25:49.340] 我的意思是，这张专辑最初的名字就叫《爱情故事》。所以，这就像是探索彼此的过往经历，并试图从中获得新的想法和感受。
[00:26:00.060] that definitely, our own experience is definitely a big inspiration for the eventual music video. Dang, I wish I could have sat in on some of those tea sessions. I feel like there was a lot of
[00:26:00.060] 当然，我们自身的经历绝对是最终音乐录影带的一大灵感来源。哎，真希望我能参与到那些茶话会中。我觉得有很多……
[00:26:09.180] gossip shared probably. Lots of tea porn. So then I guess if a lot of this project was kind of left up to both of your interpretations of the music, how much of your real experiences do you
[00:26:09.180] 大概是八卦分享吧。很多八卦爆料。所以我想，如果这个项目很大程度上取决于你们俩对音乐的诠释，那么你们的真实经历又有多少融入其中呢？
[00:26:22.700] think are in the music video? I guess like the direct question would be if some of your exes were to sit down and watch this music video, do you think they would be like, oh shit, this was
[00:26:22.700] 你觉得谁会出现在MV里？我想直接问的是，如果你的前任们坐下来看这个MV，你觉得他们会不会觉得，“我的天，这……
[00:26:32.300] from 2012. Like this was back when we were dating. Or do you think you kind of try to extrapolate the bigger themes out of your love life? When we started the video project, this was in summer of
[00:26:32.300] 那是2012年的事了。那时候我们还在约会。或者你觉得你会试图从自己的爱情生活中提炼出一些更宏大的主题吗？我们开始这个视频项目的时候，是那个夏天。
[00:26:42.140] 2021. Is that right? Yes, two years ago. Summer of 2021. So it's been two and a half years since the project was, we had our first meeting as a group. The artist actually reached out to me
[00:26:42.140] 2021年。是吗？是的，两年前。2021年夏天。所以，距离这个项目启动已经两年半了，我们第一次团队会议也是在那之后。是这位艺术家主动联系我的。
[00:26:51.820] about the project probably three years ago. And so it's been a long process. And when I started the project, I was single. And then during the project, I was in a relationship. And then I
[00:26:51.820] 这个项目大概三年前就开始了。所以这是一个漫长的过程。项目开始时我是单身。项目进行期间，我谈了恋爱。然后我
[00:27:01.740] went through a breakup. And now that was like a year later. And now we're finally releasing the project. In creating the project, I don't think there was anything that necessarily drew from the relationship that was in. That was already kind of happening while we were already, where the
[00:27:01.740] 我们分手了。现在差不多一年过去了。现在我们终于要发布这个项目了。在创作这个项目的过程中，我觉得并没有什么特别直接的灵感来源于我们当时的感情关系。那段感情其实在我们创作的时候就已经存在了。
[00:27:13.660] project was already shot. But if you were to watch the project, I think it's a natural question to ask. And I thought that's just a funny coincidence or we talk about how sometimes art imitates life
[00:27:13.660] 项目已经拍摄完毕。但如果你看过这个项目，我觉得你会很自然地提出这个问题。我觉得这只是一个有趣的巧合，或者说，我们常说艺术有时模仿生活。
[00:27:24.620] and then life imitates art. Where someone who watched that and knew me might say, oh, this must be from your personal experience. But I'm like, no, I actually shot this before I was even
[00:27:24.620] 然后生活模仿艺术。一个认识我的人看了那段视频可能会说，哦，这一定是你的亲身经历。但我会说，不，实际上我拍这段视频的时候我甚至还没……
[00:27:31.980] in that relationship. And so it's kind of this funny thing where I'm sure there was subconscious influences from just general relationships. But also, even as I'm making it, there's maybe subtle choices that I make. But when we were writing it, it was when I was single. And so
[00:27:31.980] 在那段感情关系中。所以这有点奇怪，我确信这其中肯定有来自一般人际关系的潜意识影响。而且，即便在我创作的过程中，我可能也会做出一些微妙的选择。但我们创作的时候，我还是单身。
[00:27:45.900] the fact that I went through this whole relationship arc during the music video making process, it's kind of funny. That is pretty funny. Like, was there a moment halfway where you were
[00:27:45.900] 在拍摄音乐录影带的过程中，我经历了整个恋爱关系的起伏，这本身就挺搞笑的。真的挺搞笑的。比如说，拍摄过程中有没有那么一刻，你突然……
[00:27:55.020] like, Oh, I think we have to change this one part. Like now that I'm wise, you know, some of this needs to change. As I mature as an artist. I feel like that's the stuff you got to keep in.
[00:27:55.020] 比如，哦，我觉得我们得改改这部分。就像现在我成熟了，你知道，有些东西需要改变。随着我作为艺术家的成长，我觉得有些东西是必须保留的。
[00:28:06.060] The uncomfortable, embarrassing stuff. And I wouldn't even say there's anything directly that correlates to my life specifically. But when I feel that embarrassment or oh, this is too raw, I feel like that's the stuff that has to go in. That's bars.
[00:28:06.060] 那些令人不舒服、尴尬的事。我甚至不会说有什么事直接跟我的生活有关。但当我感到尴尬，或者觉得“哦，这太痛苦了”的时候，我觉得这些东西必须写出来。这就是歌词。
[00:28:22.940] I think that's what makes it feel three dimensional. That's that stuff where I think there's a lot of directors that when I watched their movies, I see parts of their life in there. And the fact that I'm questioning whether it was real or not, I love that.
[00:28:22.940] 我觉得正是这一点让电影显得立体。很多导演的电影，我看他们的作品时，都能从中看到他们生活的影子。而我会质疑这些情节是否真实，这种感觉我很喜欢。
[00:28:37.020] I guess you can never put something out that's like, not never, but like, if you put stuff out that's less polished, or like sugar coated, then it's more possible that people will be like, Oh, yeah, like that happened to me too. I'm cringing right along with you.
[00:28:37.020] 我想你永远不能发布那种……不是说永远不能，而是说，如果你发布的东西不够精雕细琢，或者过于粉饰，那么人们就更有可能说：“哦，是啊，我也遇到过这种情况。我跟你一样尴尬。”
[00:28:55.340] It's a little bit Taylor Swift-esque. A couple weeks ago, Crystal and I and a bunch of our friends had like a karaoke night at our place. And our two friends are like huge Swifties. So
[00:28:55.340] 有点像泰勒·斯威夫特的风格。几周前，我和克丽丝塔尔还有一群朋友在我们家办了个卡拉OK之夜。我们有两个朋友都是泰勒·斯威夫特的铁杆粉丝。
[00:29:03.740] then they sat us down and we watched the entire All Too Well 10 minute version music video together on the couch. The whole time I was like, Oh my god, I'm just witnessing like exactly what happened
[00:29:03.740] 然后他们让我们坐下，我们一起在沙发上看了整部十分钟版的《All Too Well》MV。我全程都在想，我的天哪，我竟然亲眼目睹了这一切。
[00:29:13.020] in Taylor Swift's relationship. Oh my god, yeah. At some point, I think they paused and they're like explaining parts of it to us. Video breakdown. The Taylor Swift lore. And also they were like singing along to the whole thing and like the full 10 minute version
[00:29:13.020] 在泰勒·斯威夫特的恋情里。我的天哪，真的。我觉得他们好像暂停了一下，然后给我们解释了视频里的一些内容。视频解析。泰勒·斯威夫特的幕后故事。而且他们还跟着唱完了整首歌，是完整的10分钟版本。
[00:29:27.740] music video has that part in the middle where it's just like no music and the two actors are arguing. We're like, wait, should we switch to the like non music video version? They're like nah, watch the argument. I think they even like said the argument lines with the
[00:29:27.740] 音乐录影带中间有一段没有音乐，两个演员在争吵。我们当时就想，等等，要不要切换到没有音乐录影带的版本？他们说不用，看争吵那段。我觉得他们甚至还把争吵的台词都念出来了。
[00:29:46.140] argument lines with the- Oh yeah, they don't like acted it out. They already knew it. They memorized it. It was so funny. But yeah, it was like a really good story
[00:29:46.140] 那些争论的台词——哦，对了，他们不是在表演，而是早就知道了，都背下来了。真是太搞笑了。不过，这确实像是一个很棒的故事。
[00:29:55.180] told. And you know, at first we were skeptical about it. But then as it was going on, we were like engrossed. We were like, oh yeah, like what's gonna happen next? Oh my god, like-
[00:29:55.180] 告诉过你。你知道，一开始我们还挺怀疑的。但后来剧情发展下去，我们就完全被吸引住了。我们当时就想，哦，接下来会发生什么？我的天哪，就像——
[00:30:05.740] Dang, I feel like we should watch it. You probably should. It's kind of juicy. Jeff, do you feel like the how much of Love Story or No Clouds But Summer do you feel like you drew
[00:30:05.740] 哎呀，我觉得我们应该看看。你也应该看看。挺精彩的。杰夫，你觉得《爱情故事》或《晴空万里》这两部电影，你觉得你借鉴了多少？
[00:30:14.700] from certain things? I remember one of the writing process that we did was write a backstory for our characters. And that backstory was I just basically wrote my own like experience, like a compilation
[00:30:14.700] 从某些方面？我记得我们写作过程中有一项是为角色编写背景故事。而那篇背景故事基本上就是我把自己的一些经历写进去的，就像是一部合集。
[00:30:28.620] almost of like past relationships. And even like some from my current relationship. Was the party scene that was something you wrote, right? Oh, the party scene was actually from my own
[00:30:28.620] 几乎就像过去的恋情一样。甚至像我现在这段感情中的一些片段。派对那场戏是你写的，对吧？哦，派对那场戏其实是我自己的经历。
[00:30:36.460] love life. Yes. So I guess the other detail of this is the editor and my partner in Popeye Media, the production company is Kelsey, who's also my girlfriend. That party scene was inspired by the first time that we met. I didn't know y'all spelled Kelsey.
[00:30:36.460] 爱情生活。是的。所以，我想补充一点，剪辑师兼我在Popeye Media（制作公司）的合伙人是Kelsey，她也是我的女朋友。那场派对戏的灵感来源于我们第一次见面。我之前不知道你们把Kelsey拼成Kelsey。
[00:30:56.860] And she was in the scene as an extra too. Oh, she was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a cameo. Wow, that's cool. I feel like is it is it kind of weird to be like publishing a little bit of
[00:30:56.860] 她还在那场戏里客串了一个群众演员。哦，她确实客串了。对，对，对。是客串。哇，真酷。我觉得把一点点……公开出来是不是有点奇怪？
[00:31:06.780] backstory about yourself? I guess not because I feel like it feels very obscured. I don't think people would know that necessarily. You know, there are certain details that were changed to make it less specific. I don't think people would know. I think the experiences are just
[00:31:06.780] 关于你自己的背景故事？我想应该不会，因为我觉得它很模糊。我不认为人们会知道。你知道，有些细节被改动过，让它不那么具体。我不认为人们会知道。我觉得这些经历只是……
[00:31:22.780] inspiration points. And then from there, we build the whole world. So it could be something that happened that was real, but then we contextualize it to the character's experience. And then what would make sense within this world. And so if it matches with maybe our own personal experience,
[00:31:22.780] 灵感来源。然后，我们以此为基础构建整个世界。它可能取材于真实发生过的事情，但我们会将其与角色的经历联系起来，并思考在这个世界里什么才是合理的。如果它与我们自身的经历相符，
[00:31:35.820] or you know, the writer's experience, then we can kind of go with that. But if it doesn't make sense, we just kind of bring it back to the character and build off that. I guess even with
[00:31:35.820] 或者，你知道，如果是作者的经验，那我们就可以以此为基础。但如果这说不通，我们就回归角色本身，并以此为基础进行创作。我想即使是这样
[00:31:43.900] a little bit of obstruction, I can only imagine you would have to feel so vulnerable, right? Like putting out these things that may have been painful, or like Jason said, embarrassing, maybe even memories from pre real adult, like you're probably like 1415. And some of these
[00:31:43.900] 遇到一点阻碍，我能想象你会感到多么脆弱，对吧？就像要把那些可能很痛苦的事情，或者像杰森说的，很尴尬的事情，甚至是成年之前的记忆都说出来，比如你可能只有1415岁。还有一些
[00:31:59.260] relationships, like how do you kind of grapple with these thoughts of Oh, God, these are like potentially painful memories of my past, but also this would be like really good,
[00:31:59.260] 人际关系，比如你如何应对这些想法：哦，天哪，这些可能是我过去痛苦的回忆，但同时这也会非常好。
[00:32:09.900] juicy shit for the music video. This is kind of like a tangential answer. But I feel like as artists, you have to find this medium ground of like exposing yourself to like pass the wounds,
[00:32:09.900] 音乐录影带里有很多劲爆的素材。这有点像跑题了。但我觉得作为艺术家，你必须找到一个平衡点，既要袒露自己，又要传递伤痛，
[00:32:21.980] and like making yourself super cringe without like, going too far where you're like sent into a hole of depression. You just have to like open up the like seal a little bit like it's like you're
[00:32:21.980] 就像让自己变得超级尴尬，但又不会太过火，以至于陷入抑郁的深渊。你只需要稍微打开一下心扉，就像你……
[00:32:31.580] like, Oh, I remember, let me start writing this down, you know, without like opening it too wide. There's something definitely cathartic about the experience. And maybe this is kind of twisted, but I remember in early relationships, and this was when I was in film school,
[00:32:31.580] 比如，哦，我想起来了，让我把这个写下来，你知道，不要写得太详细。这种经历确实有种宣泄的作用。也许这有点扭曲，但我记得在早期的恋爱关系中，那时我还在电影学院读书，
[00:32:45.980] I would be having an argument. I had it with my with my ex in during the argument. I'm like, oh, this is really good for a script. And it's like this. Because the the passion and energy
[00:32:45.980] 我当时正在和人争吵。我和前任就是这样，争吵的时候我就想，哦，这简直太适合写剧本了。就是这样。因为那种激情和能量。
[00:32:56.700] felt so visceral. And and I felt that this could be such great stuff for a script or story. And not like partially being thinking about that, but also being in this argument at the same time.
[00:32:56.700] 感觉非常真切。我觉得这可以成为很棒的剧本或故事素材。我当时不仅在思考这个问题，而且还身处其中，积极参与到这场争论中。
[00:33:06.860] So I'm frustrated at the argument, but also excited that the art that I could create from this. And I feel there's a little bit of a lot of artists, I definitely, I'm not saying that Taylor
[00:33:06.860] 所以，我对这场争论感到沮丧，但同时也对由此产生的艺术创作感到兴奋。我觉得很多艺术家都有这种感觉，我当然不是说泰勒
[00:33:16.140] Swift sabotages her own life to create art. But sometimes it feels like that, you know, it's like, oh, another boyfriend, another story, what's next, you know, and the next album is gonna have some
[00:33:16.140] 斯威夫特为了创作艺术而自毁生活。但有时候感觉就像，你知道，就像，哦，又一个男朋友，又一个故事，接下来是什么，你知道，下一张专辑又会是什么样呢？
[00:33:24.860] Super Bowl content, who knows, you know? You know, like the life imitates art and art imitates life thing like also happened to me where I was like, Kelsey and I would have a fight. And I'm
[00:33:24.860] 超级碗的内容，谁知道呢，你知道吗？你知道，就像生活模仿艺术，艺术模仿生活这种事也发生在我身上，比如，我和凯尔西会吵架。然后我就
[00:33:34.220] like, am I hearing lines from the actual like music video? I started like disassociating. Like I went third, like third person, I looked at myself like what's happening? Like, you're like mentally recording this.
[00:33:34.220] 我好像听到了MV里的歌词？我开始感觉自己像在解离。我感觉自己像第三人称，看着自己，心想：这是怎么回事？就像你在脑子里录下这一切一样。
[00:33:48.060] That kind of back and forth. It gets weird, actually, just because we were working on it so long. And I was also editing it. So I was just like watching it again and again. I was
[00:33:48.060] 那种来回反复的过程。其实挺奇怪的，因为我们花了太长时间做这个。而且我还在剪辑。所以我就一遍又一遍地看。我当时
[00:33:54.700] like brainwashing myself. Wow. Then do you feel like your art imitates life a little more often? Or your life imitates your art? My gut feeling is that consciously, art imitates life. But subconsciously the other way around where the things I've created now become a part of the
[00:33:54.700] 就像给自己洗脑一样。哇。那么你觉得你的艺术更常模仿生活吗？还是你的生活更常模仿你的艺术？我的直觉是，有意识地，艺术模仿生活。但潜意识里则恰恰相反，我创作的东西现在都成了生活的一部分。
[00:34:18.380] things I think about. And even the things I consume become some of the things that I think about. So not even just in my own personal art, but art in general. Yeah. But I feel like that's
[00:34:18.380] 我思考的事情。甚至我消费的东西也会成为我思考的内容。所以这不仅体现在我个人的艺术创作中，也体现在艺术的方方面面。是的。但我感觉那是
[00:34:27.500] a very subconscious process versus the other way around where I'm creating from my experiences or things I'm thinking about. Retweet. I like what you said though, Jason, about how sometimes it's not even your own art that you're like getting sucked into. I feel like sometimes when I'm
[00:34:27.500] 这是一个非常潜意识的过程，而不是像我那样，从我的经历或思考中汲取灵感进行创作。转发。不过，杰森，我喜欢你说的，有时候你甚至会沉迷于自己创作的艺术作品之外的东西。我觉得有时候当我……
[00:34:43.020] binging a show, I become the main character. I'm like, okay, I'm just going to pick up this main character's traits and become them for the next week because I'm so obsessed with this show
[00:34:43.020] 追剧的时候，我感觉自己就像是剧里的主角。我会想，好吧，我这就学着这个主角的性格特点，在接下来的一周里变成他/她，因为我太迷这部剧了。
[00:34:52.940] or whatever. Yeah. Dude, when I had my succession obsession, I think almost exactly a year ago, I literally became Kendall Roy himself and I threw myself into work. And I started so many
[00:34:52.940] 或者别的什么。是啊。老兄，我痴迷于继承人计划的时候，大概差不多一年前，我简直把自己变成了肯德尔·罗伊本人，全身心投入到工作中。我启动了很多项目。
[00:35:07.340] projects. I was gunning for this promotion. And then I picked up a new obsession. I think I started watching Gossip Girl or something. And immediately I was like, I'm no longer motivated onto the next phase of my life. That's so crazy.
[00:35:07.340] 我当时一心想升职，结果却迷上了别的东西。我好像开始看《绯闻女孩》之类的剧。然后我立刻就觉得，我对人生的下一个阶段完全失去了动力。真是太疯狂了。
[00:35:23.100] It is interesting how media and the stuff we consume can modulate our emotions. We can almost tune our emotions based off what we consume, whether that's hip hop or a certain show. Yeah, for sure. And I feel like this is... We've been talking about videos and stuff,
[00:35:23.100] 媒体和我们消费的内容能够调节我们的情绪，这很有意思。我们几乎可以根据自己消费的内容来调整情绪，不管是嘻哈音乐还是某个节目。没错，确实如此。我觉得这……我们一直在讨论视频之类的东西，
[00:35:37.180] but I feel like this could also totally happen for reading scripts or reading books, especially because books give you so much specific detail and word. And then you just imagine it all in your head. I feel like it's really putting the subconscious at work versus
[00:35:37.180] 但我感觉这种情况也完全可能发生在阅读剧本或书籍时，尤其因为书籍会提供大量具体的细节和文字。然后你就可以在脑海中想象这一切。我觉得这实际上是在调动潜意识。
[00:35:53.820] films and stuff. They'll kind of set the scene for you. You have to do a little less mental labor. You just imagine yourself there. So I think that's also kind of an interesting thing.
[00:35:53.820] 电影之类的东西，它们会帮你营造氛围，让你少费脑筋，只需要想象自己身临其境就行了。我觉得这也挺有意思的。
[00:36:02.460] But then for you two as filmmakers, you have to turn the words that you first created into the whole world. So how is that process like? This is probably my favorite part of the process. I think one of the most exciting
[00:36:02.460] 但对你们两位电影人来说，作为电影制作人，你们必须将最初创作的文字转化为整个世界。这个过程是怎样的呢？这大概是我最喜欢的部分，也是最令人兴奋的部分之一。
[00:36:17.980] things about filmmaking is creating dialogue or writing lines and then hearing someone else say it or hearing someone say it on camera or seeing it in the edit. That to me is really the magic
[00:36:17.980] 电影制作的精髓在于创作对话或撰写台词，然后聆听别人演绎，或者在镜头前观看，或者在剪辑中看到最终呈现的效果。对我而言，这才是真正的魔力所在。
[00:36:30.940] of filmmaking for me, where I have argument or I have... Not necessarily argument. I have a conversation or I have an emotion I'm trying to evoke and I figure out, okay, what's the best way
[00:36:30.940] 对我来说，电影制作中，我有时会遇到争论，或者……不一定是争论。我会进行对话，或者试图唤起某种情感，然后思考，好吧，怎样才能最好地表达出来。
[00:36:39.660] to say this or tell this? And from there, seeing it being read by the actors, then we record it and then seeing it in the edit room. That's the magic or the specialness that I think is one of
[00:36:39.660] 是该说这句话，还是该讲述这个故事？然后，看着演员们朗读，我们录制下来，最后在剪辑室里看到成品。这就是它的魔力或独特之处，我认为它是其中之一。
[00:36:50.780] my favorite parts of the process. What you said, Jason, made me think of one of my favorite scenes from the music video is we shot at ABC Cafe, which is kind of this iconic vintage Hong Kong
[00:36:50.780] 我最喜欢的部分。杰森，你刚才说的让我想起了音乐录影带里我最喜欢的一个场景，我们是在ABC咖啡馆拍摄的，那是一家很有标志性的复古香港咖啡馆。
[00:37:03.420] diner in Monterey Park. Originally, we had an idea of some type of late night restaurant, but from writing it and then seeing the location to talking to the owner, to them letting us shoot,
[00:37:03.420] 蒙特雷公园的一家餐馆。最初，我们设想的是一家深夜餐厅，但从撰写剧本、实地考察、与老板交谈，到他们允许我们拍摄，一切都发生了变化。
[00:37:14.620] to putting the actors inside the scene and then lighting it and then watching it from camera, it's like what Jason said. It almost feels like this direct output from your brain into something you're seeing with your eyes. It's really trippy and very gratifying.
[00:37:14.620] 就像杰森说的那样，先把演员放到场景里，然后打光，再从摄像机的角度观察。这感觉就像大脑直接把想法输出到眼前。真的很奇妙，也很有成就感。
[00:37:29.420] Yeah, I think there's almost... For me, it's almost like the addiction of filmmaking, if you will, where knowing that that's possible and kind of chasing that feeling constantly. And that's the thing that I think drives a lot of filmmakers, at least for myself. I feel that's
[00:37:29.420] 是的，我觉得几乎……对我来说，这几乎就像对电影制作上瘾一样，你知道那种感觉是可能的，然后就不断地去追求它。我认为这至少对我自己来说，是很多电影制作人的动力所在。我觉得这……
[00:37:41.900] always something that I'm always excited about is the days we get to go film, the days we get to go be on set. Those are the funnest for me. Yeah. Do you sometimes find though that when
[00:37:41.900] 我总是最期待的就是去拍戏的日子，去片场的日子。那些日子对我来说最有趣。是啊。不过，你有没有发现，当……
[00:37:51.820] actors kind of bring whatever you wrote to life, it turns out completely different than what you imagine? Because I'm sure you're sort of visualizing something when you put pen to paper. But I feel
[00:37:51.820] 演员们把你写的东西演绎出来，最终呈现的效果和你想象的完全不同？因为我相信你在动笔写作的时候，脑海中肯定会浮现出一些画面。但我感觉
[00:38:01.820] like just like how you guys interpreted the music for your music video, actors, when they see a script, they also interpreted it themselves to their own experiences. So is it sometimes completely different from your intentions? Yeah, for sure. I think also in terms of relationships
[00:38:01.820] 就像你们为音乐录影带诠释音乐一样，演员们在看剧本时，也会根据自己的经历进行解读。所以，这有时是否与你们的初衷完全不同？是的，当然。我认为在人际关系方面也是如此。
[00:38:17.660] and love, everyone comes from a different context and different experience. So it's our job to kind of align with the actors, but also hear their opinions and input on what they feel when they're
[00:38:17.660] 每个人对爱的理解都不同，来自不同的背景，有着不同的经历。所以我们的工作是既要与演员保持一致，也要倾听他们对角色感受的意见和想法。
[00:38:28.620] embodying the script and the words and the context and the emotions that they're feeling in the moment. That process, I would say, is also very gratifying because then you can kind of see the script or the scene in different angles, the delivery accented in different ways, the kind
[00:38:28.620] 将剧本、台词、语境以及演员当下的情感融入表演之中。我认为，这个过程也非常令人满足，因为你可以从不同的角度审视剧本或场景，体验不同方式的演绎，等等。
[00:38:43.980] of back and forth being changed in the rhythm of it. That part of it is very interesting. And then also that's just the rehearsal or even the acting part of it, and then going into editing and being
[00:38:43.980] 来回切换的节奏变化，这部分非常有趣。而且，这仅仅是排练或表演部分，之后还要进行剪辑等等。
[00:38:52.860] able to fine tune that further. With our project, we wrote some lines for all the scenes, but certain scenes we kind of gave the actors a lot of freedom to operate. And that's where what you mentioned,
[00:38:52.860] 能够进一步微调。在我们的项目中，我们为所有场景都写了一些台词，但某些场景我们给了演员很大的发挥空间。而这正是你提到的，
[00:39:05.500] I think happens a lot, where they bring in whatever they're feeling in that moment. And that could be from who knows what, whether it was their own personal experiences or the way they interpreted
[00:39:05.500] 我觉得这种情况经常发生，他们会把自己当时的感受融入到表演中。而这些感受可能来自哪里，谁也说不准，可能是他们自己的个人经历，也可能是他们对事物的解读。
[00:39:15.180] the character. And lines and words would just come out. We as directors need to kind of dial this to make sure that it'll fit in the whole context. But within that moment in the world, sometimes we don't
[00:39:15.180] 角色就是这样，台词和台词自然而然地就脱口而出。作为导演，我们需要仔细斟酌，确保这些台词和台词能够融入整个故事背景。但在那种特定的情境下，有时我们却无法做到。
[00:39:23.820] know what they're going to say. And there was some stuff where we would feel that in the moment, they're just yelling at each other and like, oh my God, this is insane. And just living through
[00:39:23.820] 知道他们要说什么。有些时候，我们感觉他们当时只是在互相吼叫，然后我们会想，我的天哪，这太疯狂了。就这样经历了这一切。
[00:39:33.100] it with them in that moment. And then the craziest thing is we have to do another take. So it's that discharge. And then we reset, and then they got to do it again. And shout out to the actors who have
[00:39:33.100] 那一刻，我和他们感同身受。然后最疯狂的是，我们还得重拍一遍。所以，这就是所谓的“释放”。然后我们重新开始，他们又得重拍。向所有演员致敬！
[00:39:44.060] to kind of emotionally donate and give their energy to the world, to the camera. There was a blowout fight scene in the music video. And I feel like that was probably some
[00:39:44.060] 他们似乎在情感上奉献自己，将能量传递给世界，传递给镜头。音乐录影带里有一场激烈的打斗戏。我觉得那可能……
[00:39:53.740] of the best acting for both actors. And even to the point where it's like, we didn't necessarily script the crying scene, but it just kind of came naturally. Surprises like that are so cool. You're
[00:39:53.740] 两位演员的表演都非常精彩。甚至到了那种程度，我们并没有特意写哭戏的剧本，但它自然而然地就流露出来了。这种惊喜真的太棒了。
[00:40:04.700] like, oh my God, I can't believe it's happening right now. I feel like kind of to tie into that, though, there's a certain level of maybe like artistic freedom that you have to get used to,
[00:40:04.700] 我的天哪，我简直不敢相信这一切正在发生。不过，我觉得也正因为如此，你可能需要适应某种程度的艺术自由。
[00:40:16.380] or maybe freedom isn't the right word. But essentially, like you have a picture in your mind, but it kind of morphs and changes as the process goes on. Because there's so many artists working on one project, you know, the actors, the directors, all of that stuff,
[00:40:16.380] 或许“自由”这个词用得不太恰当。但本质上，就像你脑海中有一个画面，但随着项目的进行，它会不断演变和改变。因为一个项目是由很多艺术家共同参与的，你知道，演员、导演等等，
[00:40:30.620] you kind of have to let go of some things is what I'm imagining. I guess my question for that is, like, do you find it comes easily, for the most part? Or is it sometimes really hard to like,
[00:40:30.620] 我想，你得学会放手。所以我的问题是，你觉得大多数情况下这很容易做到吗？还是有时候真的很难做到？
[00:40:43.100] let go of this, I guess, almost like perfectionism kind of feeling? Me personally, I feel like having made films for so long now, I've given that up entirely. Like I fully acknowledge that filmmaking is like a team sport. Just to use a basketball analogy,
[00:40:43.100] 放下这种，我想，有点像完美主义的感觉？就我个人而言，我觉得拍电影这么多年，我已经完全放弃了这种想法。我完全意识到，电影制作就像一项团队运动。举个篮球的例子来说，
[00:41:00.300] there's like no hero ball here. Like there really can't be made without other people. I just accept that the changes that happen are part of the fun and part of the dynamic nature of making something together. I approach filmmaking with open hands. It's something we all share.
[00:41:00.300] 这里没有所谓的“个人英雄主义”。没有其他人的参与，一切都无从谈起。我欣然接受创作过程中出现的各种变化，它们既是乐趣的一部分，也是共同创作的活力所在。我以开放的心态投入到电影制作中。这是我们共同的事业。
[00:41:14.700] Yeah, I think the idea of perfection, in terms of getting exactly what you want, or exactly what you need, or exactly what you envision, and how they translate perfectly efficiently from the whole processing is not realistic. Or I don't think anyone's experience
[00:41:14.700] 是的，我认为追求完美——也就是完全得到你想要的、你需要的或你设想的，并且整个流程都能完美高效地实现——是不现实的。或者说，我认为任何人的经验都无法证明这一点。
[00:41:29.100] of filmmaking is like that. There's always going to be things that maybe affect the schedule or availability, or just different factors. All that plays into how things kind of happen. I think there's also the flip side where you have these quote, unquote, happy accidents.
[00:41:29.100] 电影制作就是这样。总会有一些事情影响拍摄进度、演员档期或其他各种因素。所有这些因素都会影响最终的成败。我认为另一方面，也会出现一些所谓的“幸运的意外”。
[00:41:43.740] And that adds to the film, something you didn't necessarily plan for, but it becomes the perfect thing that you didn't know you needed until you saw it and you have it. And so both contribute
[00:41:43.740] 这为电影增添了意想不到的元素，一些你原本可能没有预料到的东西，却成了你之前从未意识到自己需要的完美之物，直到你看了这部电影并拥有了它。因此，两者都发挥了作用。
[00:41:53.100] to the process and the final output. And I think that's part of the fun. There's a little bit of this randomness and faith almost. Yeah, filmmaking is almost like a faith journey a little bit too.
[00:41:53.100] 过程和最终成果都至关重要。我觉得这正是乐趣所在。其中蕴含着一丝随机性和信念。没错，电影制作在某种程度上也像是一场信仰之旅。
[00:42:02.940] Yes. There's both options too, where it might be not as good as what you imagined, but there's also times where it's way better than you could have even imagined. Yeah. I guess it's kind of truly art imitating life because life also doesn't always go as
[00:42:02.940] 是的。两种情况都有，有时候结果可能不如你想象的那么好，但有时候也会比你想象的还要好得多。嗯。我想这真可谓是艺术源于生活，因为生活也并非总是如你所愿。
[00:42:17.340] planned and you can't be too perfectionist about how everything ties together in life. Especially relationships, the whole theme of the music video is about, I feel like it's really
[00:42:17.340] 计划周全，但你不能对生活中所有事情的安排都过于完美。尤其是人际关系，这支音乐录影带的主题就是关于人际关系的，我觉得它真的很……
[00:42:29.740] hard to be like, all right, this is how things are going to go between you and me. And these are the things we need to be doing and getting everything down to a T. You kind of just have to
[00:42:29.740] 很难做到心平气和，告诉自己“好吧，你我之间的事情就这么定了。我们需要做这些事，而且要把所有细节都安排妥当。” 你必须这么做。
[00:42:40.220] ride the waves. That's a good connection. Yeah. I have a tangential story that it made me think of something I like doing when I travel is if I encounter an uncle, I will ask him what his
[00:42:40.220] 乘风破浪。这真是个不错的联想。是啊。我有个题外话，让我想起我旅行时喜欢做的一件事：如果遇到叔叔，我会问他……
[00:42:53.340] thoughts on love are. And this is kind of like a... I'll try to condense the story. But one time I was in Korea with my friend John and we were hiking up this ridiculously long mountain. And the context
[00:42:53.340] 关于爱情的想法是……这有点像……我尽量长话短说。有一次我和朋友约翰在韩国，我们爬了一座长得离谱的山。当时的情况是……
[00:43:03.980] is like last night we were clubbing. So we're super hungover and he's like, let's go for a light hike. This will kind of clear everything up. It was not a light hike. I don't think he really read
[00:43:03.980] 就像昨晚我们去夜店玩，宿醉得厉害，他就说，咱们去徒步走走吧，这样能清醒清醒。结果根本不是轻松的徒步。我觉得他根本没认真看书。
[00:43:13.340] the signs. He was like, oh, we're almost there. Literally four hours into the hike, we finally reached the peak. And it's one of those like they had metal poles on the side of the mountain
[00:43:13.340] 路标。他当时说，哦，我们快到了。徒步走了整整四个小时，我们终于到达了山顶。那里的路标就像是山腰上竖着的金属杆。
[00:43:22.540] because there's really no path. You're kind of like scaling. You're like 45 degrees on the mountain, scaling it and grappling this metal rod to go up to the top. We went there with one water bottle.
[00:43:22.540] 因为根本没有路。你只能靠攀爬。你以45度角斜靠在山上，抓着金属杆往上爬，才能到达山顶。我们去的时候只带了一瓶水。
[00:43:35.980] Just like completely unprepared, like maybe on the brink of death. But we're on the peak of the mountain. I'm looking at the like, I can't believe we're here. I'm starving. We didn't eat.
[00:43:35.980] 就像完全没有准备一样，感觉像是濒临死亡。但我们却站在了山顶。我看着眼前的景色，简直不敢相信我们真的到了这里。我饿极了。我们没吃东西。
[00:43:45.660] Like I think I had like a bagel. And then I see an uncle in the distance. He's like he has a like a fruit knife and he's like skinning a pear. And I think I stared too long to the point where
[00:43:45.660] 我当时好像在吃百吉饼。然后我看到远处有个叔叔，他拿着一把水果刀，好像在削梨子皮。我想我盯着他看了太久，以至于……
[00:43:56.540] he walked over and handed us the pear. Oh my god, it was the best pear I've ever had in my life. We both ate it and we thanked them previously. And he was like, do you guys have a way to get down?
[00:43:56.540] 他走过来递给我们一个梨。我的天哪，那是我这辈子吃过最好吃的梨。我们俩都吃了，之前已经道过谢了。然后他问，你们有办法下去吗？
[00:44:09.180] I was like, is it more difficult to get down? He's like, yes. And it's getting dark. Long story short, he walks us down and we were having this like kind of heart to heart. And I'm asking like what he
[00:44:09.180] 我问他，下去是不是更难？他说，是的。天都黑了。总之，他带我们下去，我们开始促膝长谈。我问他，他到底是怎么想的。
[00:44:18.540] thinks about love. He was just telling me that like love is sacrifice. Just kind of like what you're talking about, Crystal, was like love is sacrifice and that you just have to roll with the
[00:44:18.540] 他一直在思考爱情。他刚才跟我说，爱情就是牺牲。就像你说的，克丽丝塔尔，爱情就是牺牲，你只能顺其自然。
[00:44:28.380] punches and it's never going to be perfect. But that's what's perfect about it is what he was telling me. You know, a little delirious, but I was like, oh, let's hit it. You're right. You know?
[00:44:28.380] 拳击，而且永远不会完美。但他告诉我，这正是它完美之处。你知道，我当时有点神志不清，但我心想，哦，那就试试吧。你说得对。你知道吗？
[00:44:37.500] Yeah, we have a line in the music video where we kind of reference that idea. I think there's something about using the football analogy since the Superbowl yesterday, like Monday quarterbacking
[00:44:37.500] 是的，我们在音乐录影带里有一句歌词也提到了这个想法。我觉得用橄榄球来做比喻挺有意思的，因为昨天是超级碗，就像是周一事后诸葛亮一样。
[00:44:47.580] and thinking about what it was. It's easy to kind of frame it in these terms of sacrifice and all these things. But in the moment, it's so hard to are you sacrificing or are you compromising your
[00:44:47.580] 然后思考它到底是什么。很容易用牺牲之类的概念来定义它。但在当时，很难分辨你是在牺牲还是在妥协。
[00:44:59.020] own integrity? Or are you whatever, you know, the negative version of over sacrifice and giving too much in a way where you're taking away from maybe who you are as a person and that can be unhealthy
[00:44:59.020] 你坚持自己的正直吗？或者，你知道，你是那种过度牺牲、付出过多的负面例子，以至于你可能正在失去自我，而这可能会对你的健康造成不利影响。
[00:45:10.460] as well or overcompensating or whatever it may be. And so I think there's these nuances within the video that we're kind of exploring, but it's fun to kind of observe it as a filmmaker and kind of
[00:45:10.460] 或者说是过度补偿，或者其他什么原因。所以我觉得视频里有很多细微之处是我们正在探索的，但作为一名电影制作人，观察这些细节也很有趣。
[00:45:23.020] talk about it. For the music video, is the artist younger than you two? Yeah. So do you feel like in the process of like working with him to make the video, he learned a lot about love from you two?
[00:45:23.020] 聊聊吧。MV里的那位歌手比你们俩年轻吗？是的。那你们觉得在和他一起拍摄MV的过程中，他是不是从你们俩身上学到了很多关于爱的道理？
[00:45:41.420] Interesting. I wish he was here to answer that question. We definitely lectured him. We're giving him like the older brother energy, right? Let me tell you what you got to do, man. What do you think? Jeff, what do you think? I don't know. You know, okay.
[00:45:41.420] 有意思。真希望他能在这儿回答这个问题。我们肯定好好教训了他一顿。我们就像个老大哥一样训他，对吧？我来告诉你该怎么做，伙计。你觉得怎么样？杰夫，你怎么看？我不知道。好吧。
[00:46:00.620] Something about Junsei I think is his greatest trait is that he's very reassured. I mean, obviously take someone with like a high level of confidence that like put their life saving towards like a passion project and being like, it'll work out. He was like very chill about
[00:46:00.620] 我觉得俊世最大的优点就是他非常沉稳。我的意思是，很明显，一个如此自信的人，会把毕生积蓄投入到自己热爱的事业中，并且坚信“一切都会好起来的”。他对此非常冷静。
[00:46:14.220] everything. So I feel like I'm not sure if he learned anything because I feel like he himself has a very self reassured ideal, almost like conceptual feeling on what love is to him.
[00:46:14.220] 一切。所以我感觉我不确定他是否学到了什么，因为我觉得他自己对爱情有着非常自信的理想，几乎是一种概念性的感觉。
[00:46:26.380] And I feel like maybe ours don't necessarily line up with him. And I respect that. I kind of respect his idealism towards love. And I feel like that was always his input on the project in general,
[00:46:26.380] 我觉得我们俩的爱情观可能不太一样。我尊重这一点。我挺尊重他对爱情的理想主义。我觉得这始终是他对这个项目的总体看法。
[00:46:40.060] and like what his experience was and what he wants to convey with his music is the ideal, his ideals on love. Yeah, that's really good. I guess that's a good way to put it because I feel
[00:46:40.060] 就像他的经历，以及他想通过音乐传达的，是他对爱情的理想。嗯，这真的很好。我觉得这样说很贴切，因为我觉得
[00:46:50.380] like love is something that's easier to teach than it is to learn because I'm sure everyone has had that experience of you're like watching your close friend walk into something that you know is going
[00:46:50.380] 就像爱情一样，教起来比学起来容易得多，因为我相信每个人都有过这样的经历：眼睁睁看着自己的挚友走向某个你知道即将发生的事。
[00:47:01.900] to be a disaster in like six months. And no matter what you say, no matter which way you say it or how you try to show them, nothing's going to change because sometimes people just have to
[00:47:01.900] 大概六个月后就会变成一场灾难。无论你说什么，无论你怎么说，无论你如何努力向他们证明，都不会有任何改变，因为有时候人们就是无法接受。
[00:47:10.620] experience things and I feel like love specifically, it's like, you just have to go through it. And then you'll take away what you want to take away or what is fitting for you to take away
[00:47:10.620] 经历各种事情，尤其是爱情，我觉得你必须亲身经历。然后你才能从中汲取你想要的，或者最适合你的东西。
[00:47:19.980] in that moment. But it's like, there's just no way to actually communicate these things or pass these lessons on without that experience. And it also kind of makes me think about how love is such
[00:47:19.980] 在那一刻。但感觉就像，如果没有亲身经历，根本无法真正传达这些事情或传递这些经验教训。这也让我不禁思考，爱究竟是怎样的。
[00:47:32.140] a subjective thing. But I feel like the way everyone talks about it can sometimes make it seem like it's subjective, especially when people are like, oh, this person was so mature during the
[00:47:32.140] 这其实是个主观问题。但我感觉大家谈论这件事的方式有时会让它显得很主观，尤其当人们说，哦，这个人当时在……的时候非常成熟
[00:47:42.140] breakup, or I was so mature or whatever. It's like, what does that even mean? Like, what is maturity in a breakup? I don't I feel like that line doesn't exist, but everyone somehow kind of
[00:47:42.140] 分手，或者说我当时很成熟之类的。这到底是什么意思？分手时成熟又是什么意思？我觉得这条界限根本不存在，但每个人似乎都觉得……
[00:47:50.540] refers to it. And I always feel like it's a very like externally imposed line. It's like someone else is always telling you you're the mature one. But where is that objective line kind of?
[00:47:50.540] 指的是它。我总觉得这像是一条外在强加的界限。就好像总有人告诉你，你才是最成熟的那个。但这条客观的界限到底在哪里呢？
[00:48:01.660] So I think with this being like a major theme for your music video, Crystal and I were kind of like outlining some of these things beforehand too. And I was just like, all of this is so subjective. So it's hard to actually have like objective ideas about it.
[00:48:01.660] 所以我觉得，既然这算是你音乐录影带的一个重要主题，我和Crystal之前也确实讨论过一些相关的事情。但我当时就觉得，所有这些都太主观了，很难给出客观的看法。
[00:48:15.100] I think that's the fun part of filmmaking is that we can present our ideas. But at the end of the day, the audience makes their own decisions on what it is, whether they agree with the main
[00:48:15.100] 我认为电影制作的乐趣就在于我们可以表达自己的想法。但最终，观众会自己判断电影的本质，是否认同我们的主要观点。
[00:48:24.620] character did or not or disagree. But that's the conversation. It's not really about a specific, we may have an agenda, we may have a perspective, but once the audience has a hold of it, it's out of our control. It's out of our hands.
[00:48:24.620] 角色是否同意或不同意，这才是讨论的重点。这并非关乎某个具体事件，我们或许有自己的目的，或许有自己的视角，但一旦观众接受了这个观点，一切就超出了我们的控制范围。我们无能为力了。
[00:48:36.060] I think maybe our perspective on that we're trying to show in this music video that you just helped us articulate is perhaps that like, we're trying to show that there is no objectivity. That
[00:48:36.060] 我觉得我们想通过这支音乐录影带表达的观点，就像你刚才帮我们阐述的那样，或许是说，我们想表明，客观性并不存在。
[00:48:46.540] is the kind of gray areas that just be like subjective. And maybe the best way to approach love is to be like, there is no objectivity, just live with the subjective. I get the feeling that it's really easy to obsess over like what's right and what's wrong.
[00:48:46.540] 就是那种灰色地带，它本身就带有主观性。也许对待爱情最好的方式就是接受它没有客观性，接受它的主观性。我感觉人们很容易执着于什么是对什么是错。
[00:49:00.620] But like you said, there's so much gray area. And we oftentimes get caught up in maybe like the heat of the moment if it was, you know, say an argument or something. You're like, I want to be right,
[00:49:00.620] 但就像你说的，灰色地带太多了。我们常常会陷入情绪激动的境地，比如在争吵之类的场合。你会想，我想证明自己是对的。
[00:49:13.900] basically. Or I want this person to like, agree with what I'm trying to say and like understand what I'm trying to say that easily kind of snowballs into each side getting more defensive
[00:49:13.900] 基本上就是这样。或者说，我希望这个人能喜欢、同意我的观点，理解我的意思，但这很容易演变成双方都更加防卫。
[00:49:25.500] or more angry. And I think this kind of plays a role in larger filmmaking as well. Sometimes I feel like the best films or videos or whatever are the ones at the end where you really sit with it
[00:49:25.500] 或者更愤怒。我认为这在更宏大的电影制作中也扮演着某种角色。有时我觉得最好的电影、视频或其他作品，往往是那些最后让你真正静下心来细细品味的作品。
[00:49:38.460] and you're like, whoa, like there's so many perspectives to consider. That's why Jason has to watch past lives. Have you guys seen it? I have. I have not. Oh, I think that's one of those films that does that where you're like,
[00:49:38.460] 然后你就会想，哇，好像有好多角度需要考虑。这就是为什么杰森必须观看前世。你们看过吗？我看过。我没看过。哦，我觉得这部电影就是那种会让你觉得……
[00:49:53.100] who are you rooting for? You know, at the end? Yeah, it's definitely one of those like you sit down and you kind of think about at the end. You're like, hmm, what would I do? Or like, which one would I want to be?
[00:49:53.100] 你最后支持谁？你知道，就是最后？嗯，这绝对是那种看完之后你会坐下来好好想想的问题。你会想，嗯，我会怎么做？或者，我想成为谁？
[00:50:05.500] Yeah, go watch it. Go watch it. Yeah. So speaking of, you know, going to watch past lives, we should definitely go see your music video. Yeah. So can you let us know when your music video officially releases and where we can find it?
[00:50:05.500] 对，快去看。快去看。对。说到回顾前世，我们绝对应该去看你的MV。对。那你能告诉我们你的MV什么时候正式发布，以及在哪里可以找到吗？
[00:50:25.420] Yeah, we have two really exciting announcements. One, the music video will be released on Valentine's Day, February 14th on one of my favorite YouTube channels, Wong Fu Productions, which is a huge achievement for both me and Jason. We're super excited. We even did like an interview with them
[00:50:25.420] 是的，我们有两个非常激动人心的消息要宣布。第一，音乐录影带将于情人节当天，也就是2月14日，在我最喜欢的YouTube频道之一——Wong Fu Productions——发布，这对我和Jason来说都是一个巨大的成就。我们都非常兴奋。我们甚至还接受了他们的采访。
[00:50:41.820] and got to go to their office. I was geeking out. The second announcement is that it's going to be showing at the Disorient Asian American Film Festival in Eugene, Oregon on March 9th. And that's our first film festival premiere,
[00:50:41.820] 然后我去了他们的办公室。我当时兴奋极了。第二个消息是，这部电影将于3月9日在俄勒冈州尤金市的“迷失方向亚裔美国人电影节”（Disorient Asian American Film Festival）上放映。这将是我们的电影节首映。
[00:50:56.140] the Pacific North Forest premiere. Exciting stuff. Hopefully we'll have more submissions. But on YouTube, February 14th in theaters, March 9th. Well, awesome. I'm very excited to see it. And by the time this episode is released,
