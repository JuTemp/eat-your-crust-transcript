[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Yane.
[00:00:00.050] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Yane。
[00:00:17.370] So welcome back, Yane. You might recognize her voice from past episodes that we've done,
[00:00:17.370] 欢迎回来，Yane。你可能在我们之前的节目中听过她的声音。
[00:00:22.490] and I think the most recent one was episode 156, Modeling and Photoshoots. So go check that out if
[00:00:22.490] 我觉得最新一期是第156期，主题是模特和摄影。所以，如果感兴趣的话，可以去看看。
[00:00:28.990] you want to hear about Yane's experience being a model and doing photoshoots in the community.
[00:00:28.990] 你想了解Yane作为模特在社区进行拍摄的经历吗？
[00:00:34.670] Today we have on Yane for a very interesting topic, which is the Asian American Identity.
[00:00:34.670] 今天我们邀请到了 Yane，来谈谈一个非常有趣的话题，那就是亚裔美国人的身份认同。
[00:00:41.870] As big of a topic as this is, I feel like there have been various ways that Asian American
[00:00:41.870] 虽然这是一个很大的话题，但我感觉亚裔美国人已经采取了各种不同的方式
[00:00:48.190] identities have been represented, whether it's through specific celebrity archetypes or even
[00:00:48.190] 身份认同已经得到展现，无论是通过特定的名人原型，还是其他方式。
[00:00:53.490] those mass videos where people would actually go in and dissect these microcategories.
[00:00:53.490] 那些大型视频，人们会深入分析这些细分类别。
[00:00:58.790] I also want to say before we dive into this topic, this is obviously a topic that has been
[00:00:58.790] 在我们深入探讨这个话题之前，我还想说，这显然是一个由来已久的话题。
[00:01:04.850] heavily discussed outside of even just our podcast, and it's a complex one. It's not easy to really draw
[00:01:04.850] 这个问题不仅在我们的播客节目中被广泛讨论，而且讨论范围很广，非常复杂。要真正描绘出它的全貌并不容易。
[00:01:10.210] lines when we talk about the Asian American identity, especially since there's so many
[00:01:10.210] 当我们谈论亚裔美国人的身份认同时，尤其是因为有这么多不同的群体，就会出现很多类似的话题。
[00:01:14.270] different communities and groups within the big community of Asian American. So just want to put
[00:01:14.270] 亚裔美国人这个大群体内部存在着不同的社区和群体。所以我只想说：
[00:01:20.890] it out there that we're going to be discussing our personal thoughts, our personal viewpoints,
[00:01:20.890] 公开声明，我们将讨论我们个人的想法和观点。
[00:01:25.270] and our feelings, and we are imperfect people. So just know that before we dive into this episode.
[00:01:25.270] 还有我们的感受，我们都是并不完美的人。所以在深入探讨这一集之前，请记住这一点。
[00:01:31.990] Let's start this off by talking about the evolution of the Asian identity.
[00:01:31.990] 让我们先来谈谈亚洲身份的演变。
[00:01:36.770] How do you think this way of representing us or identifying has evolved over the years?
[00:01:36.770] 你认为这种代表我们或识别我们的方式这些年来发生了怎样的演变？
[00:01:42.790] First of all, go Asians.
[00:01:42.790] 首先，亚洲人加油！
[00:01:44.810] Woo!
[00:01:44.810] 哇！
[00:01:46.930] Yeah. And I think in terms of mainstream media representation, there's like a difference between
[00:01:46.930] 是的。而且我认为就主流媒体的呈现方式而言，两者之间存在着差异。
[00:01:53.130] Asian representation and then Asian American representation, right? So in terms of Asian
[00:01:53.130] 先说说亚裔代表，然后再说说亚裔美国人的代表，对吧？所以就亚裔而言……
[00:01:57.670] American, I feel like the main representation we had, am I saying representation too much?
[00:01:57.670] 我觉得美国人是我们的主要代表，我说“代表”这个词用得太多了吗？
[00:02:02.070] The main rep we had was like non-mainstream, like alternative media channels like YouTube,
[00:02:02.070] 我们当时的主要形象是非主流的，比如像YouTube这样的另类媒体渠道。
[00:02:09.310] right? So there are a lot of YouTube creators like Jimmy Cocoa Puffs, like My Chani.
[00:02:09.310] 对吧？所以有很多像Jimmy Cocoa Puffs、My Chani这样的YouTube创作者。
[00:02:13.010] Disney. I'm trying to give some more niche examples other than like, you know, Nigahiga,
[00:02:13.010] 迪士尼。我试着举一些比较小众的例子，而不是像Nigahiga那样的。
[00:02:18.230] like Kev Jamba, Wong Fu Productions, right? Yeah, that shit was fire.
[00:02:18.230] 就像 Kev Jamba、Wong Fu Productions 那样，对吧？没错，那玩意儿简直炸裂。
[00:02:21.910] Nowadays, we have a lot more mainstream representation, right? We got Disney, bro. Shout out Shang-Chi.
[00:02:21.910] 现在主流作品里这类题材的作品多多了，对吧？我们有迪士尼，兄弟。就拿尚气来说吧。
[00:02:28.990] Oh my God.
[00:02:28.990] 我的天啊。
[00:02:30.210] We're on the map. We got Squid Games. Squid Games fire. Wait, that's still Korean.
[00:02:30.210] 我们出名了。我们拥有了Squid Games。Squid Games太棒了。等等，那还是韩语。
[00:02:35.390] That's Asian, I didn't mean. But a lot of Americans watched it.
[00:02:35.390] 那是亚洲电影，我不是那个意思。不过很多美国人都看过。
[00:02:40.570] Yeah, so there's levels to it. But it's definitely a lot more visibility now. It's a good time. Songs are up.
[00:02:40.570] 是的，这其中有很多层次。但现在的关注度确实高了很多。现在是个好时机。歌曲都上线了。
[00:02:46.170] I will say with how Asians are sometimes represented in TV, makes me laugh a little bit. So I think it's
[00:02:46.170] 说实话，电视上对亚洲人的刻画有时让我觉得有点好笑。所以我觉得……
[00:02:52.950] gotten a lot better now. But occasionally, there'll be times where I'm watching like a mainstream
[00:02:52.950] 现在好多了。但偶尔，我还是会像个主流观众一样看电视。
[00:02:57.970] American TV show, and there's an Asian character. My first instinct is always like, oh, yeah,
[00:02:57.970] 美国电视剧，里面有个亚裔角色。我的第一反应总是，哦，是啊。
[00:03:02.870] there's an Asian person. And then my second instinct is like, okay, they are trying to adhere to that
[00:03:02.870] 那里有个亚洲人。然后我的第二个直觉是，好吧，他们是在努力遵守某种规定。
[00:03:07.650] Asians represent X percent of the community statistic too much. Like there's only one Asian allowed.
[00:03:07.650] 亚裔人口占社区总人口比例X%太高了。好像社区里只能有一个亚裔似的。
[00:03:13.090] And that's it. Because that's what the like quota is. So I think it's been getting better. But
[00:03:13.090] 就是这样。因为这就是点赞配额。所以我认为情况已经有所好转。
[00:03:18.090] occasionally, I'm just like, oh, that's the token Asian character.
[00:03:18.090] 有时候，我会想，哦，那是个典型的亚洲角色。
[00:03:20.950] The issue is that Asians actually move in packs. And so they need to have like five of them.
[00:03:20.950] 问题在于亚洲人实际上是成群结队行动的。所以他们需要五个人左右。
[00:03:26.530] Wait, that's low-key true.
[00:03:26.530] 等等，这话倒也有点道理。
[00:03:27.750] Yeah, to be realistic, it should be like that.
[00:03:27.750] 是的，说实话，就应该是这样。
[00:03:30.990] Have you guys heard of the movie Interior Chinatown that's coming out soon?
[00:03:30.990] 你们听说过即将上映的电影《唐人街内部》吗？
[00:03:35.490] It was like originally book first. Yeah.
[00:03:35.490] 就像最初是先写了书一样。是的。
[00:03:37.850] Yeah, I think it actually talks about a lot of stereotypes like that. And it's super meta.
[00:03:37.850] 是的，我觉得它确实探讨了很多类似的刻板印象。而且它非常具有元叙事意味。
[00:03:42.070] So I'm really excited for that coming out. Just wanted to plug it. You should check it out.
[00:03:42.070] 所以我很期待它的上映。只是想推荐一下。你们应该去看看。
[00:03:47.430] Actually, I also wanted to mention I do feel like in the 90s and the 2000s,
[00:03:47.430] 其实，我还想提一下，我觉得在90年代和2000年代，
[00:03:53.150] I do feel like Asian American representation was almost better in some ways. Because like you said,
[00:03:53.150] 我确实觉得亚裔美国人的代表性在某些方面甚至更好。因为就像你说的，
[00:04:00.530] now it's sort of a token minority. They're trying to make sure they hit that market, right? And appeal
[00:04:00.530] 现在它有点像个象征性的少数群体。他们想确保能打入这个市场，对吧？而且具有吸引力。
[00:04:05.390] to the market. But back then, it was very much, I don't see color, which is problematic in its own
[00:04:05.390] 推向市场。但当时的情况是，我完全看不到颜色，这本身就是个问题。
[00:04:12.150] way, right? That's very problematic. But because of that, they would just sort of casually have Asian
[00:04:12.150] 没错吧？这很成问题。正因为如此，他们才会如此随意地把亚洲人当成亚洲人。
[00:04:17.270] American actors and characters and they wouldn't make it a moment, right?
[00:04:17.270] 美国演员和角色，他们不会让这件事成为一段佳话，对吧？
[00:04:21.270] I was watching like Independence Day on the 4th of July this year. And they just had an Asian guy
[00:04:21.270] 今年7月4日，我在看《独立日》。他们里面有个亚裔男演员。
[00:04:25.650] in like the first five minutes and it was just casual. He was like part of the team. And I was
[00:04:25.650] 大概过了五分钟，气氛就很轻松随意。他就像团队的一份子。而我当时
[00:04:29.370] like, whoa, actually, like the way we even do representation. Did we go backwards? I don't
[00:04:29.370] 哇，说真的，我们现在处理代表性的方式都让人不敢恭维。我们是不是倒退了？我不这么认为。
[00:04:35.130] know. It's changed. It's evolved a lot. That's interesting because I feel like sometimes watching
[00:04:35.130] 我知道。它变了。它发展了很多。这很有意思，因为我觉得有时候看
[00:04:40.190] older movies can be kind of a jump scare on like, oh, wow, we've come a long way. Because I recently
[00:04:40.190] 老电影有时会给人一种“哇，我们进步好大”的感觉，就像突然吓你一跳一样。因为我最近
[00:04:45.690] watched Fast and Furious, the second one, Tokyo Drift. Bits in that, I was just like, bro,
[00:04:45.690] 看了《速度与激情2：东京漂移》。里面有些片段，我当时就想，兄弟，
[00:04:50.910] like how did this get past multiple editors, multiple publishing people? People actually
[00:04:50.910] 这到底是怎么通过多位编辑和出版人员审核的？居然有人真的这么做了？
[00:04:57.190] had to sign off on this. Some of the accents or, you know, other elements I felt like was kind of
[00:04:57.190] 我必须签字同意。有些口音或者其他元素，我觉得有点……
[00:05:02.670] not something that we would consider appropriate now. But I think what we were talking about earlier,
[00:05:02.670] 现在我们认为这不是合适的做法。但我认为我们之前讨论的，
[00:05:07.670] sometimes I'll watch a TV show and the token Asian character is the doctor or something. And
[00:05:07.670] 有时我看电视剧，里面唯一的亚裔角色是医生之类的。
[00:05:12.610] I'm just like, dude, why are we still doing this? Dude, the like biggest pioneer of Asian
[00:05:12.610] 我当时就想，老兄，我们为什么还要继续做这个？老兄，他可是亚洲最大的先驱之一啊。
[00:05:19.430] representation was definitely Brenda Song, London Tipton. She broke like all the stereotypes too.
[00:05:19.430] 布兰达·宋和伦敦·蒂普顿无疑是代表人物。她也打破了所有刻板印象。
[00:05:26.170] Yo, Wendy Wu, Coming Warrior, let's go. At least nowadays in movies, they cast the right
[00:05:26.170] 哟，温蒂·吴，《勇者无惧》，走起！至少现在的电影选角都挺合适的。
[00:05:34.910] ethnicity for the acting role. It used to be like, this guy is kind of East Asian, whatever. Like,
[00:05:34.910] 演员的种族背景以前是会被考虑的。比如，这个人有点像东亚人，等等。
[00:05:42.530] let's just put a put a Chinese accent on him. He's Chinese now. Yeah, which is pretty problematic.
[00:05:42.530] 我们给他配上中国口音吧。他现在就是中国人了。是啊，这可就麻烦了。
[00:05:49.130] That's true. I think we've finally started to move away from like accents a little more.
[00:05:49.130] 没错。我觉得我们终于开始逐渐摆脱对口音的执念了。
[00:05:55.090] Do you think so? Because we also have like Uncle Roger. And I actually find that people in America
[00:05:55.090] 你觉得是这样吗？因为我们也有像罗杰叔这样的人。而且我发现美国人确实如此。
[00:06:01.810] don't like his whole accent thing. But then people in Asia think he's so funny. I was like, okay,
[00:06:01.810] 我不太喜欢他的口音。但亚洲人觉得他特别搞笑。我就想，好吧。
[00:06:08.430] maybe like, I think this is offensive. But maybe that's just from my perspective, right? Yeah.
[00:06:08.430] 我觉得这有点冒犯人。但也许这只是我个人的看法，对吧？嗯。
[00:06:13.610] Actually, I think that's a very important distinction. Because I'll still watch some
[00:06:13.610] 实际上，我认为这是一个非常重要的区别。因为我还是会看一些
[00:06:17.950] comedians in Korea, for example. And they still do a lot of shit that I'm just like, this would not
[00:06:17.950] 比如韩国的喜剧演员。他们现在还做了很多让我觉得“这根本不可能”的事情。
[00:06:23.290] fly in America. But even if what is considered there might be considered racist here, the reality
[00:06:23.290] 在美国乘飞机。但即便在美国被认为是种族歧视的行为，在这里也可能被视为种族歧视，但现实情况并非如此。
[00:06:29.190] is it's just such a different culture, which doesn't make it not racist. But the cultural
[00:06:29.190] 仅仅是文化差异就足以说明问题，但这并不能改变种族歧视的本质。
[00:06:33.830] context is just completely different. So I think just like the context does make or break the situation
[00:06:33.830] 背景完全不同。所以我觉得，背景确实会决定成败。
[00:06:39.430] a lot. But oftentimes, as Americans, I think it's hard for us to kind of grasp that since a lot of
[00:06:39.430] 很多时候，作为美国人，我觉得我们很难理解这一点，因为很多……
[00:06:45.010] what we think is so America centric. That's true. I think also, though, we maybe hate it because
[00:06:45.010] 我们认为它非常以美国为中心。没错。不过，我觉得我们或许讨厌它，是因为……
[00:06:51.770] they're clumping us into this generalization that like, Asians sound like this when they speak English.
[00:06:51.770] 他们把我们归为一类，认为亚洲人说英语时听起来就是这样。
[00:06:56.930] But we're like, we're Asian, but we do not have an accent. So that is offensive to us. But then
[00:06:56.930] 但我们就像，我们是亚洲人，但我们没有口音。所以这对我们来说是一种冒犯。
[00:07:03.010] maybe for other people, actual Asians abroad, they're like, oh, haha, that's hella funny. Because
[00:07:03.010] 也许对其他人，比如身在海外的亚洲人来说，他们会觉得，哈哈，这太搞笑了。因为
[00:07:08.010] like, that is how we sound. And like, we can relate to that. Because that's what I hear every day.
[00:07:08.010] 没错，我们说话就是这样的。而且，我们对此感同身受。因为我每天都能听到这样的话。
[00:07:12.610] Yeah, I do think the lumping up at all is what really makes it offensive. Because like you said, for us,
[00:07:12.610] 是的，我认为这种一概而论的做法才是真正令人反感的地方。因为就像你说的，对我们来说，
[00:07:19.510] it's like not every Asian sounds like that. And this is so like overdone in the US. But maybe for people
[00:07:19.510] 并不是所有亚洲人都那样说话。而且这种说法在美国已经泛滥成灾了。但也许对某些人来说是这样。
[00:07:24.210] in Asia, it's like, oh, people from this country do this or like, you know, they're able to appreciate
[00:07:24.210] 在亚洲，人们会说，哦，这个国家的人会做这个，或者，你知道，他们能够欣赏。
[00:07:28.850] the nuances of different cultures and different ethnicities more.
[00:07:28.850] 更深入地了解不同文化和不同种族之间的细微差别。
[00:07:32.810] In terms of understanding Asian American dynamics, it's honestly really complex, because there's just
[00:07:32.810] 要理解亚裔美国人的社会动态，说实话，这真的很复杂，因为……
[00:07:41.430] so many different types of Asians, right? For example, like, I'm generalizing here, we're like
[00:07:41.430] 亚洲人有很多不同的类型，对吧？比如，我这里只是概括一下，我们就像……
[00:07:46.030] all first, second generation here, right? So we were either born in Asia, or our parents were born in
[00:07:46.030] 我们都是第一代或第二代移民，对吧？所以我们要么出生在亚洲，要么我们的父母出生在亚洲。
[00:07:51.250] Asia. And we came here when we were really young. And we came during the 90s tech boom, when they were
[00:07:51.250] 亚洲。我们很小的时候就来到这里。我们是在90年代科技繁荣时期来的，当时他们……
[00:07:56.030] trying to increase immigration. And there's a lot of like H1B when we uses and stuff for tech.
[00:07:56.030] 试图增加移民。而且，像H1B签证这类签证，我们经常用于科技领域。
[00:08:01.730] So that's sort of our context, right? I'm generalizing here. So let me know if I'm wrong.
[00:08:01.730] 这就是我们大致的背景，对吧？我这里只是概括性的说法。如果我说错了，请告诉我。
[00:08:05.410] But so a lot of us grew up in like, what's it called? And like the sort of like tech, like our
[00:08:05.410] 但我们很多人都是在那种……叫什么来着？那种科技氛围中长大的，就像我们的……
[00:08:09.870] parents are slightly more white collar than what it was in like the freaking 60s, right? Like post
[00:08:09.870] 现在的父母比六十年代的白领比例高多了，对吧？（点赞）
[00:08:16.290] Chinese exclusion acts type shit, right? So yeah, like our understanding of being Asian and stuff like
[00:08:16.290] 就是那种排华法案之类的东西，对吧？所以，嗯，就像我们对“亚洲人”这个概念的理解等等。
[00:08:22.790] that is totally different. Like when I went to high school, it was a very like academic Asian high
[00:08:22.790] 那完全不一样。比如我上高中的时候，那是一所非常注重学术的亚洲高中。
[00:08:28.130] school. And when I brought my lunch to school, and it was what my mom cooked me, my friends would be
[00:08:28.130] 学校。当我带午饭去学校时，午饭是我妈妈做的，我的朋友们会……
[00:08:34.190] like, yo, like, is that squid? Like, let me try some of that, right? Which is crazy anywhere else. And so
[00:08:34.190] 我说，哟，那是鱿鱼吗？让我尝尝，对吧？这在其他地方简直不可思议。
[00:08:41.790] I sort of grew up in the bubble here. It was an interesting upbringing. I appreciate it a lot. But
[00:08:41.790] 我算是从小就生活在这个与世隔绝的环境中。那是一段有趣的成长经历，我很感激。
[00:08:46.630] yeah, definitely still a bubble.
[00:08:46.630] 是的，这绝对还是个泡沫。
[00:08:48.330] You know, I actually saw a TikTok recently. That was really funny to me because it was an Asian American.
[00:08:48.330] 你知道吗，我最近在TikTok上看到一个视频。我觉得特别搞笑，因为视频里的人是个亚裔美国人。
[00:08:55.970] And she was like, yeah, I grew up in the Midwest and it's different there, right?
[00:08:55.970] 她当时说，是啊，我是在中西部长大的，那里的情况不一样，对吧？
[00:08:59.890] And she was like, low key, the Asian Americans who grow up in California are like the amount of
[00:08:59.890] 她低调地说，在加州长大的亚裔美国人数量……
[00:09:08.230] privilege they have. It's like they're almost white. And in this bubble, at least, you know,
[00:09:08.230] 他们拥有特权。他们几乎就像白人一样。至少在这个圈子里，你知道，
[00:09:14.310] in the California bubble. And I was like, oh my god, she low key has a point because there is like
[00:09:14.310] 在加州的“泡泡”里。然后我就想，我的天哪，她说的其实有道理，因为确实存在这种情况……
[00:09:19.890] less shame attached to a lot of things that we grew up with. We could express our interest in
[00:09:19.890] 我们对许多从小熟悉的事物不再感到羞耻。我们可以表达我们对……的兴趣。
[00:09:26.070] certain things and other people would understand versus, you know, them questioning and being like,
[00:09:26.070] 有些事情其他人会理解，而另一些人则会质疑，比如……
[00:09:30.750] that's weird or whatever. I think we still experienced a bit of that in like, because we
[00:09:30.750] 那很奇怪，或者别的什么。我觉得我们仍然在某种程度上经历了那种感觉，因为我们
[00:09:35.750] started being connected to the internet and it was some more outreach there. But all in all, like,
[00:09:35.750] 开始接入互联网后，我们通过互联网进行了更多拓展。但总的来说，就像……
[00:09:41.110] in the Bay Area where we were, it was like a pretty safe space to express your Asian-ness.
[00:09:41.110] 在我们所在的旧金山湾区，感觉就像是一个相当安全的空间，可以自由地表达你的亚洲身份。
[00:09:46.270] And I feel like that's like the most interesting part about being an Asian American right now is like,
[00:09:46.270] 我觉得现在作为一名亚裔美国人，最有趣的地方就在于此：
[00:09:51.930] we are able to have different ways to dissect our identity. And sometimes I think about how
[00:09:51.930] 我们可以用不同的方式来剖析自己的身份。有时我会思考，
[00:09:58.470] I feel like I can relate way more to NorCal Asian Americans than SoCal Koreans, for example.
[00:09:58.470] 例如，我觉得我更容易与北加州的亚裔美国人产生共鸣，而不是南加州的韩国人。
[00:10:06.550] You know, but if you think about it, like, oh, you know, I'm Korean American. So
[00:10:06.550] 你知道，但如果你仔细想想，比如，哦，你知道，我是韩裔美国人。
[00:10:11.690] you would think that all Korean Americans across the board would have more to relate about. But at
[00:10:11.690] 你可能会认为所有韩裔美国人应该有很多共同话题。但事实并非如此。
[00:10:16.990] the end of the day, I feel like growing up Asian American in the Bay Area is like a very specific
[00:10:16.990] 归根结底，我觉得在湾区长大的亚裔美国人经历非常特殊。
[00:10:21.690] type of experience. And I can relate more to people who have shared that experience with me versus
[00:10:21.690] 这类经历。相比之下，我更能理解那些与我有过类似经历的人。
[00:10:27.230] people who might have the same ethnic background as me and the same cultural background, but just grew
[00:10:27.230] 有些人可能和我有着相同的种族背景和文化背景，但却成长为……
[00:10:32.210] up in like a different type of area. And it's so weird because SoCal is like a five hour drive away.
[00:10:32.210] 感觉像是到了另一个地区。而且很奇怪，因为南加州离这里开车要五个小时。
[00:10:38.990] It's like a 40 minute flight. So it's like, why do I feel that difference so stark? But I still do
[00:10:38.990] 就像坐了40分钟的飞机一样。所以我就想，为什么我感觉差别这么大？但我仍然这么觉得。
[00:10:45.110] because SoCal has a lot of Koreans and NorCal definitely has a lot of Koreans, but we're not
[00:10:45.110] 因为南加州有很多韩国人，北加州也有很多韩国人，但我们不是。
[00:10:51.050] like the majority ethnic group. Whereas some pockets of SoCal might have Koreans be the majority ethnic
[00:10:51.050] 就像多数族裔群体一样。而南加州的一些地区可能以韩裔为主要族裔。
[00:10:56.650] group. So it's like all these things where I don't want to slice and dice it the way that I am,
[00:10:56.650] 群体。所以就像所有这些事情一样，我不想像现在这样把它们切分得一干二净。
[00:11:02.250] but I feel like I end up doing it anyway. It's like little microbiomes.
[00:11:02.250] 但我感觉最终我还是会这么做。这就像一个个微小的微生物群落。
[00:11:07.570] Yeah.
[00:11:07.570] 是的。
[00:11:08.890] As long as you treat people like individuals, like stereotypes are how we make our understanding
[00:11:08.890] 只要你把人当作独立的个体来对待，而不是用刻板印象来理解他们，我们就不会轻易改变对他们的认知。
[00:11:14.150] of the world to a certain extent, right? You were mentioning SoCal versus NorCal Asians,
[00:11:14.150] 在某种程度上，是全世界范围内的亚裔，对吧？你刚才提到了南加州和北加州的亚裔，
[00:11:19.770] like the Korean community and stuff. I was actually chatting with my friend who's from SoCal. She loves
[00:11:19.770] 比如韩国社群之类的。我当时正在和我一个来自南加州的朋友聊天。她很喜欢……
[00:11:25.630] SoCal and she was saying you can really feel the income inequality in NorCal, but in SoCal sort of
[00:11:25.630] 她说，在南加州，你能真切地感受到北加州的收入不平等，但在南加州，情况就没那么严重了。
[00:11:33.310] feels like everybody, no matter what your parents do or what you do, sort of hangs out. And there's
[00:11:33.310] 感觉好像每个人，不管你父母做什么，或者你自己做什么，都会聚在一起玩。而且还有……
[00:11:38.430] like a lot more feelings of diversity rather than in NorCal. It's mostly like mainland Chinese,
[00:11:38.430] 感觉这里比北加州更有多元化的氛围。这里更像中国大陆。
[00:11:44.450] right? She was saying like she misses SoCal a lot.
[00:11:44.450] 对吧？她说的好像很想念南加州似的。
[00:11:46.910] I think there's a good amount of Taiwanese people up here too. But yeah, it ends up being
[00:11:46.910] 我觉得这里也有不少台湾人。不过，最后的结果嘛……
[00:11:50.270] like Chinese people, I think are the majority.
[00:11:50.270] 我认为像中国人这样的人才是大多数。
[00:11:54.630] Right. There's also like shout out to the Viet community, shout out to the Hmong community,
[00:11:54.630] 对。还要向越南社区和苗族社区致敬。
[00:11:58.470] shout out to the Philippines, the Philippines, and everyone else. It's less nervously. There's
[00:11:58.470] 向菲律宾、菲律宾以及所有其他人致敬。气氛没那么紧张了。
[00:12:03.070] a Japanese community too. Oh gosh. I gotta shout everyone else out. But yeah.
[00:12:03.070] 还有一个日本社区。哎呀。我得感谢其他所有人。总之，是的。
[00:12:10.210] The only thing I know about like SoCal Asians or like SoCal Koreans is like the freaking LA riots,
[00:12:10.210] 我对南加州亚裔或南加州韩裔的唯一了解就是洛杉矶骚乱。
[00:12:15.150] bro. That sounds crazy. Yeah. And I think the interesting thing too is I feel like Asian American
[00:12:15.150] 兄弟，听起来真疯狂。是啊。而且我觉得有趣的是，我觉得自己像个亚裔美国人。
[00:12:23.110] identity has evolved far beyond just ethnicity now. And I see like pockets of Asian American identity
[00:12:23.110] 如今，身份认同早已超越了种族范畴。我看到了一些亚裔美国人身份认同的群体。
[00:12:30.570] and different archetypes that we see. So one example is like the Asians that love to rape.
[00:12:30.570] 以及我们看到的各种不同原型。例如，喜欢强奸的亚洲人就是一个例子。
[00:12:38.590] Another one is like the Asians that love to game. And I think there's a lot of overlap in between these
[00:12:38.590] 另一个例子是喜欢玩游戏的亚洲人。我认为这两者之间有很多重叠之处。
[00:12:44.270] identities. But for a lot of people, I feel like this becomes a really big part of how they present
[00:12:44.270] 身份认同。但我觉得对很多人来说，这会成为他们展现自我方式中非常重要的一部分。
[00:12:50.770] themselves and how they like interact with the world around them. And it's cool to see like these
[00:12:50.770] 他们自己以及他们如何与周围的世界互动。看到这样的景象真酷。
[00:12:56.470] bubbles form within the community. And it's not just like, oh, Korean Americans, like Chinese Americans,
[00:12:56.470] 社区内部会形成泡沫。而且这不仅仅局限于韩裔美国人和华裔美国人之间。
[00:13:01.670] like it's not just that anymore, you know? Yeah, it's pretty interesting how hard we like
[00:13:01.670] 好像不仅仅是那样了，你知道吗？是啊，我们喜欢得这么厉害，这很有意思。
[00:13:07.190] micro categorize ourselves. We pick out like one trait and we're suddenly we're like, you know what,
[00:13:07.190] 我们常常会给自己贴上一些细小的标签。比如，我们挑出一个特征，然后突然就觉得，你知道吗，
[00:13:13.670] that trait is going to become this group's like identity. And we're going to stereotype everything
[00:13:13.670] 这种特质将会成为这个群体的身份认同。我们将对所有事物进行刻板印象的塑造。
[00:13:18.270] based on that. And I actually had an interesting thought. I was like, what if us micro categorizing
[00:13:18.270] 基于此，我突然想到一个有趣的问题。我想，如果我们进行微观分类会怎么样？
[00:13:24.850] ourselves is a trauma response to us getting lumped together all the time by general society?
[00:13:24.850] 我们之所以会自我认同，是不是因为我们总是被社会大众一概而论而产生的创伤反应？
[00:13:33.910] You know how in the past, like you were saying, Gain, people would just kind of lump us together,
[00:13:33.910] 你知道，就像你刚才说的，盖恩，过去人们总是把我们归为一类。
[00:13:38.950] maybe get the wrong ethnicities when they're, I don't know, casting for TV or something,
[00:13:38.950] 也许他们在为电视节目或其他节目选角时，选错了种族。
[00:13:42.770] or just in general, right? And now we're like, no, we're different. And so we just micro categorize
[00:13:42.770] 或者说，总的来说是这样，对吧？而现在我们觉得，不，我们不一样。所以我们就进行更细致的分类。
[00:13:48.010] ourselves hella hard. Is anybody else like raving? Valorant? Boba? I like all these things.
[00:13:48.010] 我们玩得超嗨。还有谁跟我一样喜欢锐舞派对吗？Valorant？波霸奶茶？这些我都喜欢。
[00:13:55.870] But yeah, you guys bring up a really good point because yeah, it's weird that we like categorize
[00:13:55.870] 不过，你们说的确实很有道理，因为我们喜欢对事物进行分类，这确实很奇怪。
[00:14:00.830] ourselves and stereotype ourselves so hard in an attempt to be different. Oh, yeah, there's some
[00:14:00.830] 我们常常为了与众不同而过度地给自己贴标签，给自己设限。哦，是的，还有一些
[00:14:07.110] irony there for sure. But I do think it's kind of nice because we've broken out of the Asian people
[00:14:07.110] 这确实挺讽刺的。但我认为这也挺好的，因为我们已经摆脱了亚洲人的标签。
[00:14:13.990] just do STEM or whatever. So there is more representation, even if it might still be a
[00:14:13.990] 就学STEM之类的吧。这样就能有更多代表性，即使它可能仍然是一种……
[00:14:19.390] little bit reductive, right? They call it like boba liberalism, like the type of modern Asian.
[00:14:19.390] 有点过于简化了，对吧？他们称之为“波霸自由主义”，就像那种现代亚洲人的做法。
[00:14:24.690] Oh my gosh, I have so many complex feelings about that stuff. Because on one hand, it is nice to have
[00:14:24.690] 我的天哪，我对那些事真是百感交集。一方面，拥有这些东西当然很好。
[00:14:30.810] different representation. On the other hand, now, if you want to be quote unquote, cool,
[00:14:30.810] 不同的表现形式。另一方面，现在，如果你想显得“酷”，
[00:14:35.250] you have to do these things. Actually, wait, on the topic of raving, I also wanted to mention
[00:14:35.250] 你必须做这些事。等等，说到锐舞派对，我还想提一下……
[00:14:40.410] Asian people love raving so much that when you go to there's a really big festival here
[00:14:40.410] 亚洲人非常喜欢锐舞派对，所以当你来这里的时候，会发现这里有个非常盛大的音乐节。
[00:14:45.950] called Head in the Clouds. They will always have one EDM artist. And he's just some very talented
[00:14:45.950] 他们叫 Head in the Clouds。他们总会有一位 EDM 艺人。而且他确实非常有才华。
[00:14:53.470] white dude, right? Like they'll have like a millennium or Zen. But like the Asian people claim him
[00:14:53.470] 白人，对吧？就像他们会搞什么千年禅宗之类的。但亚洲人却声称他是他的信徒。
[00:15:00.130] will like claim whatever DJ is on. And it's I think it's so funny.
[00:15:00.130] 他们会抢着要听任何DJ正在播放的歌。我觉得这太搞笑了。
[00:15:04.230] Oh my god, I always see TikToks of like people at the raves. The caption is the great Asian migration
[00:15:04.230] 我的天啊，我总能在TikTok上看到一些关于锐舞派对的视频，标题是“亚洲大迁徙”。
[00:15:12.110] from like a millennium to Zed or something like that. And then it just shows this giant wave of
[00:15:12.110] 从大约一千年前到Zed时代之类的。然后就出现了一股巨大的浪潮……
[00:15:18.570] Asians walking to the next set. And I was like, oh my god, this is like, it fits the stereotype like all
[00:15:18.570] 亚洲人走向下一组。我当时就想，我的天哪，这简直太符合刻板印象了。
[00:15:26.370] the Asian ravers love like these DJs or whatever.
[00:15:26.370] 亚洲的锐舞爱好者喜欢这些DJ之类的。
[00:15:30.390] And you know, I thought Elenium was Asian for the longest time.
[00:15:30.390] 你知道吗，我一直以为Elenium是亚洲品牌。
[00:15:34.690] Really?
[00:15:34.690] 真的吗？
[00:15:34.910] Because I feel like I've only heard Asian people talk about him versus someone like Zed.
[00:15:34.910] 因为我觉得我只听亚洲人谈论过他，而很少听到像 Zed 这样的人谈论他。
[00:15:38.770] Like I know he's a big DJ because I see everyone across the board talk about him.
[00:15:38.770] 我知道他是个很厉害的DJ，因为我看到各行各业的人都在谈论他。
[00:15:43.410] So I was shocked to find out he was white.
[00:15:43.410] 得知他是白人时，我感到非常震惊。
[00:15:46.030] I think it's so funny how much Asian people love melodic bass.
[00:15:46.030] 我觉得亚洲人如此喜爱旋律贝斯真是太有趣了。
[00:15:50.130] That is 100% like you said, a trauma response. Because okay, I love Elenium and all these artists
[00:15:50.130] 完全就像你说的，这是一种创伤反应。因为，好吧，我非常喜欢Elenium和所有这些艺术家。
[00:15:57.450] and stuff and whatever. But when I go to these events, literally people have their arms outstretched
[00:15:57.450] 诸如此类。但当我参加这些活动时，人们真的会张开双臂。
[00:16:02.710] to the heavens as beautiful melodic bass, like all these heavenly chords play. And I'm like,
[00:16:02.710] 美妙的旋律低音直冲云霄，就像所有天籁之音奏响的和弦。而我心想，
[00:16:09.230] is this church?
[00:16:09.230] 这是教堂吗？
[00:16:10.670] Like, are we guys are we worshiping right now? Like, are we spiritual right now? And then the DJ is like,
[00:16:10.670] 比如，我们现在是在敬拜吗？我们现在有灵性吗？然后DJ就说，
[00:16:16.910] like, if you feel compelled, you know, if you're here with the ones you love. I'm like,
[00:16:16.910] 比如，如果你觉得非做不可，你知道，如果你和你爱的人在一起。我就想，
[00:16:21.790] I'm like, oh my god, it feels like I'm back in church from like when I was young. Like,
[00:16:21.790] 我当时就想，我的天哪，感觉就像回到了小时候去教堂的那种感觉。就像，
[00:16:25.490] this is crazy.
[00:16:25.490] 这太疯狂了。
[00:16:27.430] It's so true.
[00:16:27.430] 说得太对了。
[00:16:28.430] I'm just trying to feel something, I guess.
[00:16:28.430] 我只是想感受点什么而已。
[00:16:29.590] And then people are like, oh my god, like this DJ changed my life.
[00:16:29.590] 然后人们就会说，我的天哪，这个DJ改变了我的人生。
[00:16:34.130] Yeah.
[00:16:34.130] 是的。
[00:16:35.890] But I do think raving is like a good way to break out of maybe if you had a more restrictive,
[00:16:35.890] 但我确实认为，如果你之前受到更严格的限制，那么参加锐舞派对或许是一种很好的突破方式。
[00:16:42.050] like childhood, or you want to get out of being like, quote unquote, like nerdy or like whatever,
[00:16:42.050] 就像童年时期那样，或者你想摆脱那种，用引号来说，像书呆子那样，或者诸如此类的形象，
[00:16:48.890] right? I think raving is a good way to express that side of yourself. Just don't make it your whole
[00:16:48.890] 对吧？我觉得参加锐舞派对是表达你这一面的好方法。只是别让它成为你生活的全部。
[00:16:53.790] personality. You know, the world's big. There's a lot of things to enjoy. So that's my think piece on
[00:16:53.790] 个性。你知道，世界很大，有很多事情值得享受。这就是我对个性的看法。
[00:16:59.370] that. Well, I actually have two takes about the whole like, why do we, you know, dive into these
[00:16:59.370] 嗯，关于我们为什么要深入研究这些问题，我其实有两种看法。
[00:17:05.890] micro categories things so much? And one is like, yes, I feel like there's definitely a push pull of
[00:17:05.890] 微分类真的那么重要吗？其中一个人觉得，是的，我觉得这其中肯定存在一种推拉作用。
[00:17:11.770] at one point, we were all lumped into like, oh, you guys are just Asian, and therefore x, y and z
[00:17:11.770] 有段时间，我们都被一概而论，好像你们都是亚洲人，所以就被贴上了x、y、z的标签。
[00:17:16.990] kind of like traits apply to you. So then I feel like when something like that happens to a community,
[00:17:16.990] 就像某些特质适用于你一样。所以我觉得，当类似的事情发生在一个群体中时，
[00:17:22.170] it starts to divide the community a lot, where it's like, oh, I'm not like that person. Why are you
[00:17:22.170] 这开始造成社区分裂，人们会想，哦，我跟那个人不一样。你为什么会这样？
[00:17:26.670] lumping me in with that person? Like here are the reasons why we're different. You recover from
[00:17:26.670] 把我跟那个人归为一类？比如，我们明明有以下这些不同之处。你从……中恢复过来
[00:17:32.250] that by reuniting again, and being like, oh, guys, here are all the reasons why, you know, we should
[00:17:32.250] 通过再次重聚，然后说：“伙计们，以下是我们应该重聚的所有原因。”
[00:17:38.930] be a community again, because we like boba, we like raving, like you start to find easy reasons to not
[00:17:38.930] 再次成为一个社群，因为我们喜欢珍珠奶茶，我们喜欢锐舞派对，就像你开始寻找各种不参与的简单理由一样。
[00:17:44.190] hate each other, because you're in the same community anyway. But then when that happens,
[00:17:44.190] 彼此憎恨，因为你们本来就身处同一个群体。但当这种情况发生时，
[00:17:49.410] you start to see the critiques in that too. So like the boba liberalism critique, where it's like,
[00:17:49.410] 你也会开始看到针对这种观点的批评。比如对波霸奶茶自由主义的批评，比如，
[00:17:54.990] why do we hang on to these niche specific things and make that our whole identity? So then you start
[00:17:54.990] 为什么我们会执着于这些小众领域，并以此作为我们全部的身份认同？于是，你开始……
[00:18:00.490] to break out again, right? It's like, oh, I'm different in this community because of this. But
[00:18:00.490] 再次突破重围，对吧？感觉就像，哦，因为这件事，我在这个群体里显得与众不同。
[00:18:05.790] then also at the same time, because we have to affix that like Asian label towards the end,
[00:18:05.790] 同时，因为我们最后还要加上“亚洲标签”，
[00:18:10.630] maybe that makes it seem more like an issue when it doesn't really have to be.
[00:18:10.630] 也许这样反而让它看起来像个问题，而实际上它并非如此。
[00:18:14.310] Preach. But I don't know, because like, when I think about raving Asians,
[00:18:14.310] 说得好。但我不知道，因为，当我想到那些狂热的亚洲人时，
[00:18:18.110] they really make it their personality. Like they deep dive into that shit. They have like merch from
[00:18:18.110] 他们真的把这当成了自己的个性。他们深入研究过这方面的内容。他们还有相关的周边产品。
[00:18:26.230] their favorite DJs. They're like obsessed with them. That's like all they listen to just EDM.
[00:18:26.230] 他们最喜欢的DJ，简直痴迷到不行，他们几乎只听EDM。
[00:18:31.230] And like, that's all they talk about too. So I think maybe there's like an element of both sides,
[00:18:31.230] 而且他们也只谈论这些。所以我认为，或许双方都有一些共同因素。
[00:18:37.230] you know, where it's like one, we are kind of categorizing ourselves within our community. But
[00:18:37.230] 你知道，就像我们把自己归类到社区里一样。
[00:18:45.590] the people buy into it. And they're like, yeah, fuck it. I'm an Asian raver now. So then they like
[00:18:45.590] 人们都信了。他们会想，行了行了，我现在就是个亚洲锐舞爱好者了。然后他们就喜欢
[00:18:50.430] make it their personality. It's like co-opted by the people who are like trying to find their
[00:18:50.430] 让它成为他们的个性。这就像是被那些试图找到自我的人所利用一样。
[00:18:55.830] personality. Yeah.
[00:18:55.830] 性格。嗯。
[00:18:57.630] Do you think Asian people in extremely generally speaking, have more of a communal aspect than
[00:18:57.630] 你认为总体而言，亚洲人比其他民族更注重集体主义吗？
[00:19:05.150] maybe the traditional non POC Asian, right? So I think we're slightly more susceptible to like
[00:19:05.150] 或许是传统的非有色人种亚裔，对吧？所以我觉得我们更容易受到……的影响。
[00:19:11.290] cult behavior. Just putting it out there. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not a
[00:19:11.290] 邪教行为。我只是随便说说。也许吧。也许吧。我不知道。我不知道。我不是……
[00:19:16.310] scientist here. Like group behavior. Group behavior. There you go. That's a way better way to put it.
[00:19:16.310] 我是一名科学家。我喜欢群体行为。群体行为。就是这样。这样说更清楚。
[00:19:20.670] Thank you so much. Yeah. We're more susceptible to group behavior. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to say
[00:19:20.670] 非常感谢。是啊，我们更容易受到群体行为的影响。是啊，是啊。我只想说……
[00:19:24.690] I've also been to the pits of like the gaming, Asian gaming community. And I've been back, you know.
[00:19:24.690] 我也曾深入过亚洲游戏圈的底层，后来又重新振作起来。
[00:19:31.250] It's an echo chamber. Like, don't get me wrong. Once again, like I love being basic. I love
[00:19:31.250] 这是一个回音室。别误会我的意思。再说一遍，我喜欢做个普通人。我喜欢
[00:19:35.090] Valorite guys. I love League of Legends. I've given 10 years of my life. I'm qualified. But the way
[00:19:35.090] 各位英勇的玩家们。我热爱《英雄联盟》。我为此投入了十年的光阴。我有资格。但是，方式……
[00:19:40.990] everybody sort of normalizes playing freaking hours of this game every day. And oh my gosh,
[00:19:40.990] 大家似乎都把每天花好几个小时玩这个游戏当成理所当然的事了。我的天哪！
[00:19:48.130] don't even get me started on like e-dating on Valorant and stuff like that. Yeah. But it's just
[00:19:48.130] 别跟我提《Valorant》里的网上约会之类的事儿。是啊。但那只是
[00:19:52.710] it's too broad of a topic. Pause. Dude, every time I see e-daters in my lobby, I fear for my life.
[00:19:52.710] 话题太宽泛了。停顿一下。老兄，每次我在大厅里看到网上交友的人，我都提心吊胆的。
[00:20:00.170] Wait, what do you mean you see them in your lobby? They'll have like matching names, matching game
[00:20:00.170] 等等，你说你在大厅里看到他们是什么意思？他们的名字和游戏都一样。
[00:20:05.110] tags, matching like banners, just like Ayn said. And then I just fear that they'll open their mouth
[00:20:05.110] 标签，就像横幅一样，正如艾恩所说。然后我就害怕他们会开口说话。
[00:20:10.950] and like say really, you know, cringe, like couple-y stuff. And I'm like, dude, we're just
[00:20:10.950] 就像说真的，你知道，那种尴尬的、情侣间才会有的话题。我就想，哥们儿，我们只是
[00:20:16.650] trying to play a game. It's like Maple Story all over again. It is. Oh my gosh. That's such a good
[00:20:16.650] 试着玩个游戏。感觉就像回到了《冒险岛》时代。确实如此。我的天哪。这真是太棒了。
[00:20:24.630] connection. I went to Maple Fest one year in LA and it was literally all Asian people. Oh my god. And I
[00:20:24.630] 联系。有一年我去洛杉矶参加枫叶节，结果发现那里全是亚洲人。我的天哪。而且我
[00:20:30.310] was like, this explains everything. Yeah. I mean, it is literally a Korean game and also Maple Story is
[00:20:30.310] 当时我就想，这就能解释一切了。是啊。我的意思是，它本来就是一款韩国游戏，而且冒险岛也是
[00:20:35.930] awesome. But I was like, oh, like, oh. Yeah. But I guess like to conclude the whole gaming community
[00:20:35.930] 太棒了。但我当时就想，哦，哦。是啊。但我想总结一下整个游戏社区的情况。
[00:20:44.470] and stuff, I think it's awesome, right? There's like K-pop and Overwatch now and like Valorant also
[00:20:44.470] 我觉得这很棒，对吧？现在有K-pop、守望先锋，还有Valorant之类的游戏。
[00:20:50.150] works with Asian artists and stuff like that. But ultimately, like it is an echo chamber. I mean,
[00:20:50.150] 和亚洲艺术家合作等等。但归根结底，就像一个回音室。我的意思是，
[00:20:56.790] the company is doing it because, you know, they love their community, but also they want to make
[00:20:56.790] 公司这样做是因为他们热爱自己的社区，同时也想做出一番成就。
[00:21:00.690] money. And then Asian people are like, oh my god, like this is literally how I talk to my friends
[00:21:00.690] 钱。然后亚洲人就会说，我的天哪，这简直就是我跟朋友说话的方式。
[00:21:08.150] every day. It just and then they're like, oh yeah, this is normal. And I'm like, honestly, okay,
[00:21:08.150] 每天都这样。然后他们就说，哦，是啊，这很正常。我就想，老实说，好吧。
[00:21:13.890] wait, I love gamers. Y'all are my people, but like also read a book. No hate, no hate. But it's like
[00:21:13.890] 等等，我超爱游戏玩家。你们都是我的同类，不过也请读读书吧。别误会，别误会。但感觉就像……
[00:21:20.090] there's more things out there, you know? Well, I guess leaning into these personalities is also
[00:21:20.090] 你知道，外面还有很多其他的事情。嗯，我想，顺应这些性格也是……
[00:21:24.890] just more visible. It's like the hype train is there with like the raving Asians, the TikTok
[00:21:24.890] 只是更引人注目了。就像一股炒作热潮席卷而来，就像那些狂热的亚洲人和TikTok用户一样。
[00:21:29.890] Asians, the Valorant Asians. And a lot of these people also exist on the streaming or like social
[00:21:29.890] 亚洲人，尤其是玩《Valorant》的亚洲人。这些人中很多也活跃在直播平台或社交媒体上。
[00:21:35.910] media platforms too. So then you see them way more than, I don't know, the book club Asians or like
[00:21:35.910] 媒体平台也是如此。所以你看到他们的次数会比，比如说，亚洲读书俱乐部之类的要多得多。
[00:21:41.970] the volleyball Asians. It's so hard to label like all of these things as like the Asians.
[00:21:41.970] 亚洲排球运动员。很难把所有这些都贴上“亚洲人”的标签。
[00:21:49.330] Jisoo is a book club Asian. So am I dude, dab me up. Okay, but I also was thinking as we were,
[00:21:49.330] Jisoo是读书俱乐部的亚洲人。我也是，兄弟，给我点个赞。好吧，不过我们当时我在想，
[00:21:59.670] you know, talking this through, like, I would say us three are not necessarily in any specific
[00:21:59.670] 你知道，仔细想想，我觉得我们三个不一定属于任何特定的关系。
[00:22:07.310] micro category, but some other people truly are in a micro category. So I'll say for example,
[00:22:07.310] 微小类别，但有些人确实属于微小类别。例如，我会说：
[00:22:14.690] like, I also like playing Valorant, but I'm not like a Valorant Asian. And like, Yane, you know,
[00:22:14.690] 我也喜欢玩Valorant，但我不是那种玩Valorant的亚洲玩家。还有，Yane，你知道的，
[00:22:20.330] she likes Valorant. She likes raving. She likes Boba, but she's not really like, she's not really
[00:22:20.330] 她喜欢玩《Valorant》，喜欢去锐舞派对，喜欢波巴·费特，但她其实不是那种人，她其实不是那种人。
[00:22:26.170] like belonging to just one of those micro categories, right? Yeah. Wait, I'm sorry. Yane loves Boba.
[00:22:26.170] 就像只属于某个细分类别一样，对吧？嗯。等等，不好意思。Yane喜欢珍珠奶茶。
[00:22:33.510] I was sending me. Yeah. Wait, you said that. I do. Shout out Taiwan. Yeah. And so I feel like
[00:22:33.510] 我当时在给我发消息。是啊。等等，你刚才说了。没错。向台湾致敬。是啊。所以我感觉……
[00:22:41.290] you can definitely like a certain, you know, thing that's part of a certain subcategory,
[00:22:41.290] 你当然可以喜欢某个特定子类别中的某个东西，你知道的。
[00:22:47.830] but like you yourself don't have to make it your whole personality. So I think there's definitely
[00:22:47.830] 但就像你自己一样，你不必把它变成你全部的个性。所以我认为这绝对是有道理的。
[00:22:53.190] that split, right? There are certainly people who just really buy into it and like lead the charge
[00:22:53.190] 这种分歧，对吧？当然，有些人完全认同这种观点，并且带头推动。
[00:22:58.650] for that subcategory. And then there's also other people who like dabble, but aren't fully immersed
[00:22:58.650] 就该子类别而言。此外，还有一些人喜欢浅尝辄止，但并未完全沉浸其中。
[00:23:05.090] into a certain subcategory. That's a good point. To qualify as a Valorant Asian, there are like
[00:23:05.090] 归入某个特定子类别。说得对。要符合 Valorant 亚洲玩家的资格，需要满足类似这样的条件：
[00:23:11.390] specific attributes that you must have. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think a lot of Asian American content
[00:23:11.390] 你必须具备的特定素质。是的。哦，是的。我认为很多亚裔美国人的内容
[00:23:18.190] creators, for example, will lean into these things. Actually, what Jesus said earlier is really
[00:23:18.190] 例如，创作者们会倾向于这些事情。实际上，耶稣之前所说的才是真正如此的。
[00:23:23.490] interesting because like when other races follow trends, nobody's like, oh, this race trend. Ooh,
[00:23:23.490] 有趣的是，当其他种族追随潮流时，没有人会说：“哦，这是另一个种族的潮流。”
[00:23:30.990] right. Like, but then for Asian people, I do think we're a little bit hard on ourselves because when
[00:23:30.990] 对。但是，对于亚洲人来说，我觉得我们确实有点对自己要求过高，因为当
[00:23:36.970] they do play into these niches, it's actually them expanding out of their worldview. It's just that
[00:23:36.970] 他们的确迎合了这些细分市场，实际上是他们在拓展自己的世界观。只是……
[00:23:42.730] we're a little bit more like, I don't want to say mature, but we've had more time to expand into
[00:23:42.730] 我们现在更像是，我不想用“成熟”这个词，但我们有更多的时间来拓展业务。
[00:23:50.510] a lot of different interests, right? So like right out of college, yeah, I went to a ton of raves,
[00:23:50.510] 兴趣爱好很多，对吧？所以大学毕业后，我参加了很多锐舞派对。
[00:23:54.990] but then after that, it's like, oh, okay. I also like, I don't know. I also like D&D. I also like
[00:23:54.990] 但之后，我就觉得，哦，好吧。我也喜欢，我不知道。我也喜欢《龙与地下城》。我也喜欢
[00:24:00.050] reading. Like I like art, like music, whatever. Right. I do think a lot of these people are either
[00:24:00.050] 阅读。就像我喜欢艺术、喜欢音乐等等一样。没错。我的确认为这些人中有很多要么是，要么是。
[00:24:06.170] maybe younger or not really interested in a lot of other things. Yeah. Maybe it's like too fun.
[00:24:06.170] 或许是年纪小，或者对其他很多事情都不太感兴趣。是啊，或许是因为太好玩了。
[00:24:11.810] I don't know. This is it. That's all they need. You know? Like I do think Asian content creators,
[00:24:11.810] 我不知道。就是这样。他们只需要这些。你知道吗？就像我确实认为亚洲内容创作者，
[00:24:19.030] because they see these trends, they see the market, they see the easy audience to capture. I see them
[00:24:19.030] 因为他们看到了这些趋势，看到了市场，看到了容易获取的受众群体。我看到了他们。
[00:24:25.430] leaning into these things. For example, like there's a huge cultural discourse on like TikTok
[00:24:25.430] 深入研究这些事物。例如，TikTok 上就存在着大量的文化讨论。
[00:24:31.410] and Twitter and stuff like that, where people are criticizing the biggest Asian American creators.
[00:24:31.410] 还有推特之类的平台，人们在上面批评一些最知名的亚裔美国创作者。
[00:24:35.910] And they're like, you're holding Asian people back, like when they see your dives and stuff.
[00:24:35.910] 他们会说，你拖累了亚洲人，就像他们看到你的跳水之类的动作时那样。
[00:24:40.690] But as a creator, it's very normal to lean into trends. And yeah, again, like other races don't
[00:24:40.690] 但作为创作者，追随潮流是很正常的。而且，没错，好像其他种族就不会这样似的。
[00:24:46.310] get criticized for that as much, I feel like. So yeah, that's a really good point. Like we can't fault
[00:24:46.310] 我觉得应该为此受到很多批评。所以，你说的很有道理。我们不能责怪任何人。
[00:24:51.090] them. That's how they're going to make their money. That's how they're going to keep their
[00:24:51.090] 他们就是这样赚钱的。他们就是这样维持生计的。
[00:24:55.090] audience's attention. It's been kind of proven that sometimes if you move away from what your audience
[00:24:55.090] 观众的注意力。已经有一些证据表明，有时候如果你偏离观众的关注点，反而会适得其反。
[00:25:01.850] expects, then you can expect to probably lose a good chunk of them because they're like, this is
[00:25:01.850] 如果你抱有期望，那么你很可能会损失很大一部分客户，因为他们会觉得，这是
[00:25:07.490] not what I came here for. I subscribed to see like Valorant content, but now suddenly you're just
[00:25:07.490] 这不是我来这里想看的。我订阅是为了看Valorant之类的内容，但现在突然就只有这些了。
[00:25:13.630] chatting at us, you know? So I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense that like, we can't just
[00:25:13.630] 跟我们聊天，你知道吗？所以我觉得你说的很有道理，我们不能就这么……
[00:25:20.830] always look at creators to like pave the way because it's like their job. They just have to do what's
[00:25:20.830] 总是要仰仗创作者们开辟道路，因为这就像是他们的工作。他们只需要做好自己该做的事。
[00:25:27.430] going to be entertaining and successful for them. You know, this actually reminds me of like,
[00:25:27.430] 对他们来说，这将是一件既有趣又成功的事情。你知道吗，这让我想起了……
[00:25:32.830] I've seen this comment posted a lot on Korean articles sometimes where there will be a Korean
[00:25:32.830] 我经常在一些韩语文章里看到这条评论，文章里通常会有韩语内容。
[00:25:39.130] person that does something that is bad, I guess to say in a general sense. For example, if there was
[00:25:39.130] 泛指做了坏事的人。例如，如果有
[00:25:46.230] some corruption uncovered in like the Korean government and it becomes like international
[00:25:46.230] 韩国政府等机构被揭露存在一些腐败行为，这已经演变成国际问题。
[00:25:50.170] news, right? A comment that I'll often see is like, oh, this is like an international embarrassment
[00:25:50.170] 新闻，对吧？我经常看到这样的评论：哦，这简直是国际丑闻。
[00:25:55.550] or this is like giving us global shame. Like you are bringing shame onto Korea. And I wonder if some
[00:25:55.550] 或者说，这简直是在给我们带来全球耻辱，就像你们在给韩国蒙羞一样。我想知道，有些人是否也这样认为。
[00:26:01.750] of that sentiment is echoed in how we view like representation in the Asian American community,
[00:26:01.750] 这种情绪也体现在我们对亚裔美国人社区中同类代表性的看法上。
[00:26:06.990] where we want someone to be like the face of the community. And if they do something that's bad,
[00:26:06.990] 我们希望找到一个能代表社区形象的人。如果他们做了不好的事，
[00:26:13.230] or maybe doesn't align with what I want the community to progress towards, we're like, oh,
[00:26:13.230] 或者，这可能与我希望社区发展的方向不符，我们就会想，哦，
[00:26:18.470] this is bad for the white gays or like this is bad in terms of other communities looking at our community.
[00:26:18.470] 这对白人同性恋群体来说是件坏事，或者说，从其他群体看待我们群体的角度来看，这很不好。
[00:26:25.910] In a lot of ways, that's like unfair. And I guess I don't necessarily know if other communities are
[00:26:25.910] 在很多方面，这都不太公平。而且我也不确定其他群体是否也这样。
[00:26:31.430] thinking that when they see big Asian creators, like are they necessarily saying, oh, this creator
[00:26:31.430] 想想看，当他们看到亚洲知名创作者时，是否一定会说：“哦，这位创作者……”
[00:26:36.030] is like this. So therefore, the entire Asian community is like this. Like that's probably not
[00:26:36.030] 就是这样。所以，整个亚洲社区都是这样的。这可能并非事实。
[00:26:40.590] necessarily true. But I do feel like it's a sentiment that is often echoed. It's like, oh, you're making
[00:26:40.590] 这未必是事实。但我感觉这种观点经常被提及。就好像，哦，你这是在制造……
[00:26:45.870] the Asian community look bad. That's so true. Like it just falls onto this one person's shoulders when
[00:26:45.870] 亚裔群体的形象受损。这话太对了。感觉所有责任都落在了这一个人的肩上。
[00:26:53.070] they didn't ask for it. Like they're just trying to make a living. And I guess it depends too,
[00:26:53.070] 他们并没有要求这样做。他们只是想谋生而已。而且我觉得这也要看情况。
[00:26:58.670] whether like this person is doing something truly like egregious that's just, you know,
[00:26:58.670] 不管这个人是否做了真正令人发指的事情，你知道，
[00:27:04.110] universally accepted as like wrong. But sometimes I see that criticism on, I don't know, like small
[00:27:04.110] 普遍认为这种批评是错误的。但有时我看到这种批评出现在一些无关紧要的小事上。
[00:27:10.150] stuff like, oh, this is embarrassing. Like take this down, bro. You're making the community look bad.
[00:27:10.150] 比如，“哦，这太尴尬了。兄弟，赶紧删了吧。你这样会给社区抹黑。”
[00:27:14.410] Mm hmm. Oh, that's a lot of pressure. Yeah. I think that's so true. And I think it was very
[00:27:14.410] 嗯哼。哦，压力真大。是啊。我觉得说得太对了。而且我觉得这非常
[00:27:20.070] common. And I honestly think it's still kind of common in like media, right? Like in like Hollywood,
[00:27:20.070] 很常见。而且说实话，我觉得在媒体圈里还是挺常见的，对吧？比如在好莱坞。
[00:27:25.410] like, oh my God, this one person basically represents the whole Asian community because
[00:27:25.410] 我的天哪，这个人基本上代表了整个亚裔群体，因为
[00:27:30.330] they get to be on the big screen. But like they didn't ask for that. And like they should be allowed
[00:27:30.330] 他们有机会登上大银幕。但好像他们并没有要求似的。好像他们就应该被允许这样做似的。
[00:27:35.550] to still be themselves at the same time. It's hard because when we're thinking about it,
[00:27:35.550] 同时还要保持自我。这很难，因为当我们思考这个问题时，
[00:27:41.050] sometimes it's like, well, that one person maybe is like the only representation that we're getting
[00:27:41.050] 有时候感觉，嗯，那个人或许就是我们能得到的唯一代表。
[00:27:48.030] on the big screen or whatever. And so we're all relying on this, you know, this one figure,
[00:27:48.030] 在大银幕上或其他什么地方。所以我们都依赖于这一个数字。
[00:27:53.830] but like hopefully it gets better with more representation. I do feel like nowadays we get
[00:27:53.830] 但希望随着更多代表性的出现，情况会有所改善。我觉得现在我们确实有更多代表性了。
[00:28:00.890] a little bit more representation in media. Maybe that huge weight of responsibility is lightening a bit,
[00:28:00.890] 媒体上的代表性有所提高。或许，那份沉重的责任感正在减轻一些。
[00:28:07.730] but I feel like I've heard that criticism a lot and the criticism of that criticism. That's like,
[00:28:07.730] 但我感觉我已经听过很多次这种批评，以及对这种批评的批评。这就像是，
[00:28:13.250] hey, we can't just, you know, expect this one person to do all the heavy lifting for our one
[00:28:13.250] 嘿，我们不能指望一个人包揽我们所有的重担。
[00:28:19.730] community. Right. First of all, I think, yeah, maybe we should just let people be like weird,
[00:28:19.730] 社区。没错。首先，我觉得，或许我们应该允许人们做些怪人，
[00:28:26.270] let people be different. Right. But I saw on TikTok, there was this trend where even if someone's doing
[00:28:26.270] 允许人们与众不同。没错。但我在TikTok上看到一种趋势，即使有人这样做
[00:28:31.450] something a little bit weird, instead of like commenting anything mean on TikTok, they'll be like,
[00:28:31.450] 有点奇怪的是，他们不会像其他人那样在TikTok上发表恶意评论，而是会这样：
[00:28:35.710] who is this diva? Oh my God. Yeah. Or they'll say like, oh my God, do you do weddings?
[00:28:35.710] 这位女明星是谁？我的天哪。是啊。或者他们会问，我的天哪，你承接婚礼拍摄吗？
[00:28:43.230] Oh my God. Which I think is like, it's just cute, right? Like just let people be a little bit quirky,
[00:28:43.230] 我的天哪。我觉得这样挺可爱的，对吧？就让人们有点古怪吧。
[00:28:48.290] I guess. Yeah. Yeah. My favorite is like a combo. It's like close enough. Do you do weddings?
[00:28:48.290] 我想是吧。嗯。嗯。我最喜欢的是两者的结合。感觉差不多就行了。你承接婚礼摄影吗？
[00:28:56.510] I think it's so funny. Maybe we should just let people be themselves more because I also felt
[00:28:56.510] 我觉得这太搞笑了。或许我们应该让人们更自在地做自己，因为我也有同感。
[00:29:02.930] growing up. I literally, I think Asian people struggle with this all the time. Like we're
[00:29:02.930] 成长过程中。我真的觉得，亚洲人一直都在为此挣扎。就像我们……
[00:29:07.970] always like, oh, we don't fit in. I don't feel like we fit in. But it's like, who are we trying
[00:29:07.970] 总是感觉，哦，我们格格不入。我觉得我们格格不入。但转念一想，我们到底想融入谁呢？
[00:29:11.830] to fit into? Right. When I was growing up, I didn't feel like I fit in with the Korean fobs.
[00:29:11.830] 融入？没错。我小时候，总觉得自己和那些韩国新移民格格不入。
[00:29:16.530] And then I hang out with Korean Americans and then I'm like, I don't, they feel like I fit in with you
[00:29:16.530] 然后我和韩裔美国人一起玩，然后我就觉得，不，他们觉得我跟你很合得来。
[00:29:20.030] either. I don't know. And then there's like ABGs and I'm like, I don't know how to be an ABG.
[00:29:20.030] 也不知道。还有像ABG（美国黑人音乐爱好者）这样的人，我就想，我不知道该怎么成为一名ABG。
[00:29:23.850] I don't know how to look this bad. I'm sorry. Yeah. And then the Valorant people, I'm like,
[00:29:23.850] 我不知道怎么会看起来这么糟糕。对不起。是啊。然后是《Valorant》的玩家们，我就想，
[00:29:28.430] I love video games, but I don't know how to do this either. Right. So like, yeah, I feel like I
[00:29:28.430] 我喜欢玩电子游戏，但我也不知道该怎么做。没错。所以，嗯，我觉得我
[00:29:34.050] carved my own way, but it was, it wasn't out of me being like, oh, like I'm different. It's like,
[00:29:34.050] 我走出了自己的路，但这并不是因为我觉得自己与众不同。而是……
[00:29:38.270] oh God, I'm different. Like, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know how to, how to hang like this guys.
[00:29:38.270] 天哪，我跟别人不一样。我也不知道该怎么说。是啊，我不知道该怎么跟这些家伙混在一起。
[00:29:42.990] I'm sorry. So I think I'm a diva. Okay, guys, this might be a little deep, but do you think this is
[00:29:42.990] 对不起。我觉得我有点耍大牌。好吧，各位，这可能有点深奥，但你们觉得这是不是……
[00:29:50.270] just us becoming our parents because we see a certain micro subculture become successful and
[00:29:50.270] 我们只是变成了我们的父母，因为我们看到某种微型亚文化群体获得了成功。
[00:29:58.130] maybe success is defined in different ways. It's like, they have friends, they have fun,
[00:29:58.130] 或许每个人对成功的定义都不一样。比如，他们有朋友，他们玩得开心，
[00:30:02.990] they're successful in their jobs, you know, any of those things. And so we are hard on ourselves
[00:30:02.990] 他们在工作中很成功，你知道，各方面都很成功。所以我们对自己要求很高。
[00:30:08.270] because we're like, we need to do something that gets us up there too. And so it's easy to like put
[00:30:08.270] 因为我们觉得，我们也需要做一些能让我们达到那个高度的事情。所以很容易就会想：
[00:30:14.450] yourself into one of these like micro categorizations because you're like, if I do it this way,
[00:30:14.450] 你会把自己归入这些微观分类中的某一类，因为你会想，如果我这样做，
[00:30:20.070] I'll be successful. Like those other people I see too. Yeah. I think it's like the sense of
[00:30:20.070] 我会成功的。就像我看到的其他人一样。是的。我觉得这就像一种感觉……
[00:30:25.990] belonging aspect for sure. And maybe it's kind of like, oh, I don't feel like I am truly American
[00:30:25.990] 归属感方面肯定是有的。也许有点像，哦，我感觉自己并不真正算得上美国人。
[00:30:32.570] because I'm not white. And then you go back to Korea and you're like, I don't feel like I'm
[00:30:32.570] 因为我不是白人。然后你回到韩国，你会觉得，我感觉自己不像个白人。
[00:30:35.870] truly Korean because they look at me funny when I'm there. And then you come back and you're like,
[00:30:35.870] 真的很像韩国人，因为我在那里的时候，他们都用奇怪的眼神看我。然后你回来之后，你会想，
[00:30:40.850] guys, I'm a Valorant Asian. Like this is the community I choose.
[00:30:40.850] 各位，我是个玩《Valorant》的亚洲玩家。这是我选择的社区。
[00:30:47.690] I also think it like it applies to us expecting like, you know, influencers or content creators
[00:30:47.690] 我觉得这也适用于我们期待看到像网红或内容创作者这样的人。
[00:30:54.530] or whatever people in the media to like uphold the community image because that's like kind of what
[00:30:54.530] 或者说，媒体人士为了维护社区形象而采取的种种措施，因为这就像是……
[00:31:00.890] your parents are doing with you, right? Or the stereotype, right? You're supposed to like do
[00:31:00.890] 你父母对你做的，对吧？或者说，是那种刻板印象，对吧？你应该像他们那样做。
[00:31:06.270] things that make your parents proud. So we're like almost expecting these people to represent us
[00:31:06.270] 那些能让父母感到骄傲的事情。所以我们几乎是期待这些人能代表我们。
[00:31:12.330] and make us proud. Yeah, that's true. Cause I was unemployed for like a year, but I was working
[00:31:12.330] 让我们为你感到骄傲。没错，确实如此。因为我失业了差不多一年，但我一直在工作。
[00:31:18.750] on like Twitch streaming and blah, blah, blah. But I would have to tell Asian parents, I wouldn't tell
[00:31:18.750] 比如在Twitch直播之类的，等等等等。但我得告诉亚洲父母，我不会告诉他们
[00:31:24.330] them like, oh, I'm unemployed. I would be like, oh, I'm a freelance entrepreneur, which is like
[00:31:24.330] 他们会说，哦，我失业了。我会说，哦，我是个自由职业创业者，这就像
[00:31:29.310] the craziest cap. But that was the only way for them to not like look down on me. Right. So I feel
[00:31:29.310] 那顶帽子真是太疯狂了。但那是他们不瞧不起我的唯一办法。没错。所以我感觉
[00:31:35.650] like that's probably happening on a, on a bigger scale. You have to be like an intelligent Asian
[00:31:35.650] 这种情况很可能正在更大规模地发生。你得像个聪明的亚洲人那样才行。
[00:31:40.170] American creator who's capable of like think pieces and stuff like that and having a stance on every
[00:31:40.170] 这位美国创作者擅长撰写评论文章之类的东西，并且对每件事都有自己的立场。
[00:31:44.530] issue or, or you're like not our representation. Yeah. Like why can't I just be an Asian himbo?
[00:31:44.530] 问题在于，或者说，你觉得这不是我们的代表。是啊。就像为什么我就不能是个亚洲肌肉男呢？
[00:31:52.510] Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Turn up. Yeah. Maybe that's what the Riz content in a lot of the Asian American
[00:31:52.510] 当然！当然！嗨起来！没错！也许这就是 Riz 在很多亚裔美国人身上所体现的内容吧。
[00:32:00.430] community is about, right? They're like, why can't I just be like a hot, cool guy? Like,
[00:32:00.430] 社区的意义就在于此，对吧？他们会想，为什么我就不能像个帅气又酷炫的男生一样呢？比如，
[00:32:07.770] yeah. Oh my God. That's a great point actually. I mean, at the end of the day, I will say I am
[00:32:07.770] 是啊。我的天哪。这确实是个很好的观点。我的意思是，说到底，我还是会说我是
[00:32:13.390] happy to see the rise of Asian creators and whatnot. I feel like are very mainstream, but I do feel a
[00:32:13.390] 很高兴看到亚洲创作者的崛起等等。我觉得他们已经非常主流了，但我确实觉得……
[00:32:19.070] little bit weird about it sometimes because like the Riz content in some ways, a lot of these
[00:32:19.070] 有时候会觉得有点奇怪，因为在某些方面，就像Riz的内容一样，很多这些
[00:32:23.350] creators are kind of like hopping on whatever is trendy or like on the bandwagon. But is it weird that
[00:32:23.350] 创作者们似乎总是追逐潮流，或者说随波逐流。但这难道不奇怪吗？
[00:32:29.290] what's trendy is Asian faces? You know, I'm like, I'm glad you're capitalizing on it, but then that
[00:32:29.290] 现在流行亚洲面孔？你知道，我的想法是，我很高兴你们利用这一点，但是……
[00:32:35.030] also makes me uncomfortable, like what you're capitalizing on. And this is no shade to like
[00:32:35.030] 这也让我感到不舒服，比如你利用这种心态牟利。我这么说并没有恶意。
[00:32:39.990] the creators themselves, but it's like the wave and like the movement and the general audience
[00:32:39.990] 创作者本身固然重要，但这就像浪潮、就像运动，也影响着广大观众。
[00:32:44.870] thinking of us as a trend is like mildly weird. You're so right. For every Asian creator, if you
[00:32:44.870] 把我们当成一种潮流，这感觉有点怪异。你说得太对了。对于每一位亚洲创作者来说，如果你
[00:32:51.990] looked at their comments, they would be like, oh my God, you look like Jungkook or like, oh my God,
[00:32:51.990] 看了他们的评论，他们会说，我的天哪，你长得好像柾国，或者，我的天哪，
[00:32:56.790] you look like Won Young. And it's like, please at least name an actual like Asian idol or whatever
[00:32:56.790] 你长得像元英。拜托，至少说个真正的亚洲偶像什么的吧。
[00:33:05.850] that they look like. You're like, this is completely inaccurate. Yeah. Yeah. And the K-pop stuff opens
[00:33:05.850] 他们看起来就像那样。你会想，这完全不准确。是啊。是啊。然后K-pop的东西就出现了。
[00:33:15.990] like a whole new door to there are times where, I mean, Korean content and actually just Asian content
[00:33:15.990] 就像打开了一扇全新的门，有时候，我的意思是，韩国内容，实际上就是亚洲内容。
[00:33:22.110] in general is like trendy now and has been for a long time. But I feel like there are always those
[00:33:22.110] 总的来说，现在很流行，而且流行了很久。但我感觉总会有一些例外。
[00:33:26.950] moments where someone was, someone is like, oh, you're Korean. Like this new K-drama is popular
[00:33:26.950] 有些时候，有人会说：“哦，你是韩国人啊。” 比如，这部新韩剧很受欢迎。
[00:33:31.470] right now. Did you watch it? And I'm just like, no. Oh my God. That's right. I was joking with Jisoo
[00:33:31.470] 就是现在。你看了吗？我当时就想，没有。我的天哪。没错。我当时是在和智秀开玩笑。
[00:33:38.010] when we were talking about this episode. I was like, oh, that's right. Like there was definitely a period
[00:33:38.010] 当我们讨论这期节目的时候，我就想，哦，对。确实有那么一段时期。
[00:33:43.210] of time where K-pop started to really blow up and suddenly you are all expected to be like professional
[00:33:43.210] 在K-pop开始真正爆红的那个时期，突然之间，所有人都被期望像专业人士一样。
[00:33:49.530] Korean ambassadors. So real. Don't get me wrong. I love my K-pop. In terms of like K-pop,
[00:33:49.530] 韩国大使们。太真实了。别误会，我爱K-pop。就K-pop而言，
[00:33:58.750] I also feel like the beauty standards are really insane. It's like a weird combination because I'll
[00:33:58.750] 我也觉得现在的审美标准真的太疯狂了。这感觉很奇怪，因为……
[00:34:04.950] say that I'm Korean and then it's like people will like give me like plus two attractive points.
[00:34:04.950] 如果我说我是韩国人，那就好像人们会给我加两分似的。
[00:34:11.330] And I'm like, oh, like you're fetishizing me. But like, I mean, I guess I'll take the points.
[00:34:11.330] 我当时就想，哦，你这是在物化我啊。不过，好吧，我接受这些分数。
[00:34:18.150] I don't know. Like, am I supposed to reject the points? I don't know what to do here.
[00:34:18.150] 我不知道。我应该拒绝这些分数吗？我不知道该怎么办。
[00:34:21.270] Yeah. And I do think the beauty standard stuff also stresses me out a lot because
[00:34:21.270] 是的。而且我觉得关于美的标准也让我压力很大，因为
[00:34:27.690] shit, I'm not an idol. What the heck? Yeah. I can't perform to that standard. And I,
[00:34:27.690] 妈的，我又不是偶像。搞什么鬼？是啊。我达不到那个标准。而且我，
[00:34:33.590] I do feel like there's a lot of pressure to sort of like represent Korean-ness in that way. Like
[00:34:33.590] 我确实觉得，要以这种方式代表韩国文化，压力很大。
[00:34:39.790] whether it's like, oh, you should be able to like dance and know how to do this makeup trend or
[00:34:39.790] 比如，哦，你应该会跳舞，而且要懂得如何驾驭这种妆容潮流，或者
[00:34:44.370] whatever. And you should be good at video games or something. And it's like, damn,
[00:34:44.370] 随便吧。你应该擅长玩电子游戏什么的。然后就感觉，哎，
[00:34:48.130] is this how Filipino people feel? Oh my God. Their parents expect them to be good at karaoke.
[00:34:48.130] 这就是菲律宾人的想法吗？我的天哪。他们的父母竟然期望他们擅长卡拉OK。
[00:34:52.730] I heard that if you're Filipino and you're not good at singing, you literally get bullied as like a
[00:34:52.730] 我听说，如果你是菲律宾人，又不擅长唱歌，就会被欺负，就像……
[00:34:57.290] kid. Like all my friends said like, oh, I didn't know how to sing, but like they would bully me. So
[00:34:57.290] 孩子。就像我所有朋友说的那样，哦，我不会唱歌，但他们会欺负我。
[00:35:02.110] I had to learn. Yeah. But yeah, it's cool to see Korean stuff trending. I mean, for me,
[00:35:02.110] 我不得不学。是啊。不过，看到韩国的东西流行起来确实挺酷的。我的意思是，对我来说，
[00:35:09.910] I feel like I grew up in a Korean household. I grew up watching a lot of like Korean TV, had Korean
[00:35:09.910] 我觉得自己就像在韩国家庭长大一样。我从小就看很多韩国电视节目，也接触韩国文化。
[00:35:13.990] friends. So I feel not too stressed about it, but I worry about like, you know, people who don't feel
[00:35:13.990] 朋友们。所以我感觉压力不大，但我担心那些不这么想的人。
[00:35:20.370] as connected or maybe they're like Asian or if you guys have read like crying in H Mart, let me just
[00:35:20.370] 就像有联系的人，或者他们可能像亚洲人，或者如果你们看过像在H Mart哭泣之类的故事，让我来告诉你……
[00:35:25.750] say, I did not read crying in H Mart. I read the first five pages and I was like, oh my God, this is
[00:35:25.750] 我说，我没读过《在H Mart哭泣》。我读了前五页，然后我就想，我的天哪，这……
[00:35:30.310] an extremely poignant story about like a Asian experience. And like, she feels disconnected because she lost
[00:35:30.310] 这是一个极其感人的故事，讲述了一个亚洲人的经历。她感到与世隔绝，因为她失去了……
[00:35:37.630] her mom. I cannot relate to this. I cannot relate to this whatsoever. But the struggle is like
[00:35:37.630] 她的妈妈。我无法感同身受。我完全无法感同身受。但这种挣扎就像……
[00:35:43.610] completely real. Right. Yeah. I feel like that is a side effect, though, of these micro categories
[00:35:43.610] 完全真实。没错。是的。不过我觉得这是这些细分类别带来的副作用。
[00:35:49.730] blowing up. And some of the micro categories we've been talking about, whether it's like the rave one
[00:35:49.730] 正在迅速发展。我们一直在讨论的一些细分领域，比如锐舞派对之类的。
[00:35:53.590] or the gaming one, like those are kind of chosen categories. But I feel like there are also micro
[00:35:53.590] 或者游戏类，这些都是比较特定的类别。但我感觉还有微型游戏。
[00:35:58.170] categories that are like inflicted onto people. I saw this TikTok once that was like, sorry, I'm not
[00:35:58.170] 有些分类就像是强加在人们身上的。我曾经在TikTok上看到过一个视频，大概意思是：抱歉，我不是
[00:36:03.710] this kind of Asian and the kind of Asian that they were apologizing for not being was like the
[00:36:03.710] 这种亚洲人，以及他们为自己不是的那种亚洲人而道歉的亚洲人，就像……
[00:36:08.270] hot Asians on TikTok that like do a specific makeup style or something like that. And that is like what
[00:36:08.270] TikTok上那些喜欢特定妆容风格或其他类似风格的性感亚洲女孩。这大概就是……
[00:36:14.990] happens, I think, when like a specific look blows up. Not everyone can relate to that, even if you're
[00:36:14.990] 我觉得，这种情况通常发生在某种特定造型突然爆红的时候。但并非每个人都能感同身受，即使你……
[00:36:20.910] the same racial group or the same ethnic group. So then you start to feel like, oh, these people can
[00:36:20.910] 同一种族或同一族裔群体。所以你就会开始觉得，哦，这些人可以
[00:36:25.730] look like this. How come I can't? And I think that's also like the chasm between what we're seeing with
[00:36:25.730] 看起来像这样。为什么我做不到？我认为这也是我们所看到的与现实之间的鸿沟。
[00:36:30.370] like Asian guys or Asian girls blowing up on TikTok. But then you also see still a lot of Asian people
[00:36:30.370] 比如一些亚裔男生或女生在TikTok上爆红。但你也会看到很多亚裔人士
[00:36:37.230] complaining that in the dating scene, they're seen as like undesirable. I guess mostly like Asian men, I
[00:36:37.230] 抱怨说在约会中，他们不被视为理想伴侣。我想这主要和亚洲男性一样。
[00:36:43.590] think is more common for that topic. So it's like weird. It's like we're trending. But then at the same
[00:36:43.590] 认为这个话题更常见。所以感觉很奇怪。感觉我们上了热搜。但同时
[00:36:49.730] time, like statistically, we're still kind of suffering in a certain sense.
[00:36:49.730] 从统计数据来看，从某种意义上说，我们仍然在遭受苦难。
[00:36:56.790] Dude, just move to the Bay. People date Asians here all the time.
[00:36:56.790] 哥们儿，干脆搬去湾区吧。这里的人经常和亚洲人谈恋爱。
[00:37:01.270] Dude, literally, I give dating advice on my Twitch and that ends up being half of the advice. Like
[00:37:01.270] 老兄，说真的，我在Twitch上给别人提供约会建议，结果这占了我所有建议的一半。
[00:37:06.370] just move to California, which is not productive advice. Yeah, the housing prices are crazy. But
[00:37:06.370] 搬去加州？这可不是什么好建议。没错，那里的房价确实高得离谱。
[00:37:13.050] yeah, touching on like Asian beauty standards. I think it's so crazy that Asian faces are so
[00:37:13.050] 是啊，说到亚洲人的审美标准。我觉得亚洲人的脸这么受人追捧真是太疯狂了。
[00:37:18.770] trending right now that like Asian fishing is a huge issue. Basically, if you do your makeup in
[00:37:18.770] 现在很流行的说法是，亚洲渔业是一个大问题。基本上，如果你化妆的话……
[00:37:25.630] a certain way, like Douyin or like K-Beauty or like Japanese makeup, like if you have a little bit of
[00:37:25.630] 以某种方式，比如抖音、韩妆或者日系妆容，就像如果你有一点点……
[00:37:30.530] like aeggiosar, people will be like, oh my god, you're Asian fishing. Like you're trying to be
[00:37:30.530] 就像埃吉奥萨尔一样，人们会说，我的天哪，你在亚洲钓鱼。好像你想成为……
[00:37:34.770] Asian, aren't you? And it's just such a double edged sword because I'm sure some people are maybe like
[00:37:34.770] 你是亚洲人，对吧？但这真是一把双刃剑，因为我确信有些人可能……
[00:37:41.150] appropriating. But I feel like most of the time what I've seen is like, for example, I have this like
[00:37:41.150] 挪用。但我感觉我看到的大部分情况都是这样的，例如，我有这个，就像
[00:37:46.750] Native American friend and she looks very traditionally like maybe Asian, like she has
[00:37:46.750] 我有个美洲原住民朋友，她的长相很传统，可能有点像亚洲人，就像她有
[00:37:50.470] monolids and stuff like that. And she gets so much hate and she's literally like, this is my face,
[00:37:50.470] 单眼皮之类的。她因此遭受了很多恶意攻击，但她却说：“这就是我的脸。”
[00:37:55.550] guys. Like I don't know what to say. Yeah, it's definitely really hard to figure out that line
[00:37:55.550] 伙计们。我真不知道该说什么。是啊，那句话确实很难说出口。
[00:38:02.170] between like appreciation for like the trend and the beauty and how much of it is like, oh, like,
[00:38:02.170] 欣赏潮流和美感，以及它所代表的意义，哦，就像……
[00:38:07.650] do you want to be Asian? Like you're scaring me a little bit there, Ariana Grande.
[00:38:07.650] 你想成为亚洲人吗？你这话有点吓到我了，爱莉安娜·格兰德。
[00:38:13.630] Yeah. I mean, that makes total sense because your friend has monolids and a huge part of Asian makeup
[00:38:13.630] 是的。我的意思是，这完全说得通，因为你朋友是单眼皮，而且亚洲妆容很大一部分都是单眼皮。
[00:38:19.710] is, you know, adapting around monolids because so much of like the makeup that we see in the
[00:38:19.710] 你知道，很多妆容都是针对单眼皮设计的，因为我们看到的很多妆容都是针对单眼皮的。
[00:38:25.450] Western world does not really work with monolids. So it's like, of course, your friend should like
[00:38:25.450] 西方世界对单眼皮不太友好。所以，你的朋友当然会喜欢单眼皮。
[00:38:30.850] look into what the other monolidded people are doing and adapt, you know, use that to work for
[00:38:30.850] 看看其他单眼皮的人都在做什么，然后加以调整，你知道，利用这些经验去工作。
[00:38:37.130] herself too. So it's definitely applicable to people. But yeah, I guess you're right. Like some
[00:38:37.130] 她自己也一样。所以这肯定适用于其他人。不过，我想你说得对。就像某些人一样。
[00:38:41.090] people maybe hop on to these trends in a more like appropriation-esque way that's almost like
[00:38:41.090] 人们可能会以一种更像是文化挪用的方式来追赶这些潮流，这几乎就像……
[00:38:48.350] taking advantage of it. I think it's mostly like the historical context of it, which is always really
[00:38:48.350] 充分利用它。我认为这主要取决于它的历史背景，而历史背景总是非常重要的。
[00:38:55.750] hard to separate from like the current thing that's happening. So I think that's sort of the context.
[00:38:55.750] 很难将它与当前正在发生的事情分开。所以我认为这就是背景。
[00:39:00.710] But it's also like all of us are pretty young. And like if we didn't do that in the past, like is it
[00:39:00.710] 但感觉我们大家都还很年轻。而且如果我们过去没做过那样的事，那会怎么样呢？
[00:39:08.530] okay to do Asian beauty trends? I don't know the rules here. I don't make society's rules, you know,
[00:39:08.530] 可以尝试亚洲美妆潮流吗？我不太了解这方面的规则。你知道，我又不是制定社会规则的人。
[00:39:13.770] I just live in here. But I've even seen it to the extent that there's like RCTA communities, which
[00:39:13.770] 我就住在这里。但我甚至见过像RCTA社区那样的地方，
[00:39:19.610] stands for like race change to another. I'm sorry if I'm exposing your audience to like really horrible
[00:39:19.610] 意思是像种族转换一样。如果我让你的观众接触到一些非常可怕的东西，我很抱歉。
[00:39:24.690] content. But this stuff is really popular with very like young people, right? Because when a lot of people
[00:39:24.690] 内容。但这种东西在年轻人中真的很受欢迎，对吧？因为当很多人
[00:39:31.470] who are Asian, when they were younger, you know, they thought to themselves like, oh, I wish I was white.
[00:39:31.470] 你知道，有些亚裔女孩在年轻的时候，会想，哦，我希望自己是白人。
[00:39:36.430] Right. And it's because they were like bullied or they wanted to fit in. But now there's other
[00:39:36.430] 没错。那是因为他们曾经被欺负，或者他们想融入群体。但现在有了其他选择。
[00:39:41.950] ethnicities who are like, I wish I was Asian. And I think, oh, my God. No, like you can completely
[00:39:41.950] 有些族裔的人会说：“我真希望自己是亚洲人。” 我心想，我的天哪。不，就像你可以完全……
[00:39:49.750] appreciate Asian culture. And you know what? I will be your ambassador. Like hit me up. I will show you
[00:39:49.750] 欣赏亚洲文化。你知道吗？我愿意做你们的文化大使。联系我吧，我会带你们领略亚洲文化的魅力。
[00:39:55.010] Asian things without you having to feel like, oh, let me change my race. Right. Yeah. Also, that's not a
[00:39:55.010] 享受亚洲文化，而不用让你觉得，哦，让我改变一下我的种族。对。是的。而且，那不是……
[00:40:01.050] thing. I don't know. I have also seen that pocket of TikTok too. And I feel like I feel so conflicted
[00:40:01.050] 事情就是这样。我不知道。我也看过TikTok上的那部分内容。我感觉自己很矛盾。
[00:40:07.870] about it because in a certain sense, I feel like Gen Alpha is growing up in an era that's like less
[00:40:07.870] 我之所以这么想，是因为从某种意义上说，我觉得阿尔法世代成长在一个相对不那么开放的时代。
[00:40:15.610] racist in terms of like what's portrayed on mainstream media. Because to be honest, like I
[00:40:15.610] 就主流媒体的描述而言，这确实带有种族主义色彩。因为说实话，就像我
[00:40:20.710] feel like a lot of the movies and like content that was like shown on cable or like literally in
[00:40:20.710] 感觉很多电影和内容都像是在有线电视上播放的，或者就像字面上那样。
[00:40:25.490] movie theaters when we were young was actually blatantly racist. And Gen Alpha is not exposed
[00:40:25.490] 我们小时候去的电影院其实充斥着赤裸裸的种族歧视。而阿尔法世代却对此毫不知情。
[00:40:31.510] to that content as much anymore. But also at the same time, I've been seeing such racist shit on like
[00:40:31.510] 我现在对这类内容的关注度不如以前了。但与此同时，我也看到了很多种族歧视的言论，比如……
[00:40:37.430] IG reels. I feel like it's really bad or certain pockets of TikTok where I read the comments and
[00:40:37.430] IG Reels。我觉得TikTok某些地方的评论真的很糟糕，我看了那些评论之后……
[00:40:43.350] I'm like, I thought we were past this, but it's actually coming back with like a vengeance. So then
[00:40:43.350] 我当时想，我以为我们已经摆脱这件事了，但它实际上却卷土重来，而且来势汹汹。所以……
[00:40:48.310] it makes me feel like Gen Alpha isn't necessarily born in like a post-racism era. You know,
[00:40:48.310] 这让我感觉阿尔法世代未必是出生在一个后种族主义时代。你知道，
[00:40:53.250] they're just born in an era where it's like virtue signaling and like, you know,
[00:40:53.250] 他们生于一个崇尚道德优越感的时代，你知道的。
[00:40:58.630] portraying yourself as anti-racist coexists with like other very harshly racist content on social
[00:40:58.630] 把自己标榜为反种族主义者，却又在社交媒体上看到其他极其恶劣的种族主义内容，这简直匪夷所思。
[00:41:06.090] media. So it's almost like the two extremes have just gotten more extreme and it's all like on one
[00:41:06.090] 媒体。所以感觉就像两个极端都变得更加极端了，一切都像是在同一件事上。
[00:41:11.530] platform still. So I don't know, maybe this changing race thing is like a product of both of those things
[00:41:11.530] 平台依然存在。所以，我不知道，也许这种种族变化是这两种因素共同作用的结果。
[00:41:19.890] coexisting because wanting to change your race into being Asian is kind of wholesome and anti-racist,
[00:41:19.890] 之所以能共存，是因为想把自己的种族变成亚洲人这种想法本身就很健康，而且是反种族歧视的。
[00:41:27.210] but also like severely racist and like, you know, appropriative at the same time.
[00:41:27.210] 但同时也带有严重的种族歧视色彩，而且你知道，还有文化挪用的问题。
[00:41:32.190] Yeah, that's accurate.
[00:41:32.190] 是的，没错。
[00:41:34.130] I think like a more mainstream example of that too could be like the Sumu Liu and like
[00:41:34.130] 我认为更主流的例子可能就是像刘氏兄弟那样的人物。
[00:41:39.570] Boba thing, Boba. Like they smoke Boba with like the second B. There was like a Shark Tank episode
[00:41:39.570] 波霸奶茶，波霸奶茶。就像他们用第二个B来抽波霸奶茶一样。好像有一集《创智赢家》里讲过。
[00:41:44.430] where somebody pitched Boba and they were like, oh, the drink doesn't have to be ethnical anymore.
[00:41:44.430] 有人推销珍珠奶茶，他们就说，哦，这种饮料不再需要带有任何民族特色了。
[00:41:48.430] Even though they literally work with Taiwanese manufacturers, but they're trying to pitch Boba
[00:41:48.430] 尽管他们实际上是和台湾厂商合作，但他们却想推销珍珠奶茶。
[00:41:52.490] as like this non quote unquote ethnic drink to be sold to like a different market. And you could
[00:41:52.490] 就好像这种并非所谓“民族饮品”的东西要卖给另一个市场一样。而且你可以
[00:41:59.270] tell those people were also like, I don't think they were necessarily American. Like they had a
[00:41:59.270] 告诉那些人，我觉得他们未必都是美国人。就像他们有……
[00:42:04.090] slight accent. So I think they're from a different country. Right. And then that means like whole other
[00:42:04.090] 口音有点重。所以我认为他们来自另一个国家。没错。那意味着完全不同的
[00:42:07.670] race relations or whatever. But Simu Liu was like, hey, like this is a like a Taiwanese
[00:42:07.670] 种族关系什么的。但刘思慕却说，嘿，这就像一个台湾人
[00:42:13.270] Taiwanese drink. Like this already exists. The other panel member who was like a South Asian woman,
[00:42:13.270] 台湾饮料。好像这东西已经存在似的。另一位小组成员，看起来像个南亚女性，
[00:42:18.970] she was the one who was actually like, hey, like there's room for innovation. Like that. Right.
[00:42:18.970] 她才是真正提出“嘿，这里还有创新空间”的人。就是这样。没错。
[00:42:24.910] Yeah. I think that's sort of like a, an example of those two micro microcosms, like you said,
[00:42:24.910] 是的。我觉得这就像是你说的这两个微观世界的例子。
[00:42:30.350] or those two like voices talking to each other. Right. Like one is sort of appreciating in a
[00:42:30.350] 或者说，这两个声音就像在互相交谈。没错。就像其中一个在欣赏……
[00:42:35.050] misunderstanding way of this thing. And then like the quote unquote woke person who actually knows
[00:42:35.050] 误解了这件事。然后就像那些所谓的“觉醒人士”一样，他们其实知道
[00:42:40.090] like the situation is like, hey, like that's, that's not exactly right. Yeah. And then there's
[00:42:40.090] 情况就像是，嘿，这，这不太对劲。是啊。然后还有……
[00:42:45.530] a third person who was like, why are you angry? Like stop being angry. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah.
[00:42:45.530] 第三个人说，你为什么生气？别生气了。是啊。我不知道。是啊。
[00:42:50.890] It is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. I think part of me kind of wonders how long this trend, this Asian
[00:42:50.890] 就是这样。是啊。是啊。我有点好奇，这种亚洲风潮到底会持续多久。
[00:42:57.750] trend is going to continue because the reality of it is like to us, it's obviously not a trend. It's
[00:42:57.750] 这种趋势还会继续下去，因为对我们来说，它实际上并非一种趋势，而是一种现实。
[00:43:02.670] just like our life, but in the mass media and like in the general audience, I think it kind of
[00:43:02.670] 就像我们的生活一样，但在大众媒体和普通受众中，我认为这有点……
[00:43:09.610] might be a trend. So then are we riding this wave and then suddenly it's going to crash and then
[00:43:09.610] 这可能只是一种趋势。那么我们现在是不是正乘着这股浪潮，然后突然间它就要崩盘了？
[00:43:14.850] everyone's going to go back to like looking down or making racist jokes about Asian communities again,
[00:43:14.850] 大家又会开始瞧不起亚裔群体，或者拿亚裔群体开种族歧视的玩笑了。
[00:43:19.930] or is it going to truly continue and become also mainstream? And then the other aspect of me is
[00:43:19.930] 或者它会继续发展下去，并最终成为主流？而我的另一个方面是……
[00:43:26.590] also like we tend to tunnel vision on like specific ethnicities and like the representation of those
[00:43:26.590] 我们似乎也容易对特定族裔及其代表性产生狭隘的关注。
[00:43:32.690] specific ethnicities. Everyone else who doesn't fit into those molds just don't get as much of a
[00:43:32.690] 特定族裔。其他不符合这些刻板印象的人就得不到那么多机会。
[00:43:39.610] voice. So I feel like that is also a pretty big problem as well. And you can see that fallout in
[00:43:39.610] 声音。所以我觉得这也是个相当大的问题。而且你可以从中看到这种影响……
[00:43:45.570] like subtle Asian traits, like how it initially started. I was like, guys, look, we're all Asian.
[00:43:45.570] 比如一些微妙的亚洲特征，就像最初那样。我当时就想，伙计们，看，我们都是亚洲人。
[00:43:49.970] And then people started coming out and being like, well, yes, we are all Asian, but why are we only
[00:43:49.970] 然后人们开始站出来说，是的，我们都是亚洲人，但为什么只有我们
[00:43:54.550] talking about, you know, these three things? We don't feel like we're being represented. And then
[00:43:54.550] 说到这三件事？我们感觉自己没有被代表。
[00:43:59.590] those communities start to like make their own sub pages and whatnot. And, you know, I just hope that
[00:43:59.590] 这些社群开始创建自己的子页面之类的东西。你知道，我只是希望
[00:44:05.290] other communities instead of just East Asian countries are going to get a voice. And hopefully
[00:44:05.290] 不仅仅是东亚国家，其他族群也将拥有发言权。希望如此。
[00:44:11.650] it's moving towards there. But, you know, it's it's just hard, I think.
[00:44:11.650] 它正朝着那个方向发展。但是，你知道，我觉得这很难。
[00:44:16.090] Oh, I love that, actually, because sometimes people will bring up like Korean stuff and I'm like, yo,
[00:44:16.090] 哦，我其实很喜欢这样，因为有时候人们会提起韩国的事情，然后我就会想，哟，
[00:44:21.410] yeah, the Korean stuff is everywhere. We don't need to talk about Korean stuff. I'm like, what Asian are
[00:44:21.410] 是啊，韩国的东西到处都是。我们没必要再谈韩国的东西了。我就想，亚洲人到底有什么？
[00:44:24.510] you like? You teach me phrases in your language. Like, what do you guys eat? Like what it was your culture?
[00:44:24.510] 你喜欢吗？你可以教我一些你们语言的短语。比如，你们平时吃什么？你们的文化是什么样的？
[00:44:29.810] Same with like South Asian inclusion. I remember that was like a huge issue in the subtle Asian
[00:44:29.810] 南亚裔群体的包容性也是如此。我记得这在当时的亚洲文化圈里是个很大的问题。
[00:44:34.250] traits page, which is crazy because like we are all so Asian. We have all the same like cultural
[00:44:34.250] 特征页面，这太奇怪了，因为我们都非常具有亚洲特色。我们拥有相同的文化背景。
[00:44:41.190] roots and it's almost like sort of a disconnect from our history. Like if you go to South Asia,
[00:44:41.190] 根源，这几乎就像是我们与历史的一种脱节。比如，如果你去南亚，
[00:44:47.470] like you'll see people who look East Asian, right? Or like whatever, because these lines are all
[00:44:47.470] 就像你会看到长相像东亚人的人，对吧？或者其他什么人，因为这些线条都代表着……
[00:44:53.010] arbitrarily drawn. If you guys watch Monkey Man, which is like a fantastic movie by Dev Patel, by the way,
[00:44:53.010] 随意画的。顺便一提，如果你们看过戴夫·帕特尔主演的《猴人》（Monkey Man），那真是一部很棒的电影。
[00:44:58.810] like I highly, highly recommend it. You can see he represents all different types of South Asians.
[00:44:58.810] 我强烈推荐。你可以看到他代表了各种类型的南亚人。
[00:45:03.530] And it just made me feel really connected like to South Asia. Like that's why I think like media
[00:45:03.530] 这让我感觉和南亚建立了一种很深的联系。这就是为什么我喜欢媒体的原因。
[00:45:09.390] representation is really good. And I think it's really important to reconnect with generations past
[00:45:09.390] 这种代表性真的很好。而且我认为与过去几代人重新建立联系非常重要。
[00:45:16.210] in order to like fully understand what it means to be like Asian, sort of like a homecoming situation.
[00:45:16.210] 为了充分理解身为亚洲人意味着什么，有点像回家一样。
[00:45:22.250] Yeah, I feel like there's like a level of erasure that comes with being Asian in the US.
[00:45:22.250] 是的，我觉得在美国，作为亚裔会面临某种程度的抹杀。
[00:45:27.950] I think maybe some of that is just like the history that we learn is American focus. And then
[00:45:27.950] 我觉得这可能跟我们所学的历史主要以美国为中心有关。
[00:45:34.070] also after that, it's more like Eurocentric than it is revolving around Asia. But when I talk to my
[00:45:34.070] 而且在那之后，它更像是以欧洲为中心，而不是以亚洲为中心。但是当我与我的
[00:45:40.070] parents, like they know so much about the intricacies of different countries that exist in East Asia and
[00:45:40.070] 父母们，好像他们对东亚各国错综复杂的关系了如指掌似的。
[00:45:45.390] Southeast Asia and South Asia. And these are things that I don't know, even though I feel like on a day
[00:45:45.390] 东南亚和南亚。这些都是我不了解的地方，尽管我觉得有一天……
[00:45:50.850] basis, like I interact with a lot of people who come from these communities, we just don't talk
[00:45:50.850] 比如，我经常和来自这些社区的人交流，但我们之间并不怎么说话。
[00:45:56.750] about it as much or like learn about it as much in the US. I don't know, it's kind of like what happens
[00:45:56.750] 在美国，人们对这方面的了解和学习并不多。我不知道，这有点像……
[00:46:01.790] when you're in like a melting pot, maybe like you just start to not hear these things as much as you
[00:46:01.790] 当你身处一个文化熔炉中时，也许你就会开始不太常听到这些话了。
[00:46:07.730] would if you grew up elsewhere. And it's crazy, because my parents grew up in Korea. And it's like,
[00:46:07.730] 如果你在别的地方长大，情况可能就不一样了。这很不可思议，因为我的父母是在韩国长大的。感觉就像，
[00:46:13.690] they're learning about shit that I'm not learning about in the US. But Korea is like a very homogenous
[00:46:13.690] 他们学到的东西，我在美国根本学不到。但韩国就像一个非常同质化的国家。
[00:46:18.710] country. So I just don't understand why that divide happens.
[00:46:18.710] 国家。所以我就是不明白为什么会出现这种分歧。
[00:46:22.630] I think the way your ethnicity is treated in the US depends on the greater like geopolitical
[00:46:22.630] 我认为你的族裔在美国受到的待遇取决于更大的地缘政治因素。
[00:46:31.470] relationship between the US and your country, right? Realistically. And yeah, the US is infamous,
[00:46:31.470] 美国和你们国家的关系，对吧？说实话。而且，美国臭名昭著。
[00:46:37.070] like you said, for not having good international studies and teachings, right? Because like,
[00:46:37.070] 就像你说的，是因为国际研究和教学不够好，对吧？因为，
[00:46:43.350] ultimately, our schools have to teach us like US is the best and like,
[00:46:43.350] 归根结底，我们的学校必须教导我们，我们是最好的，就像……
[00:46:48.370] yeah, we have to do all this military intervention stuff. Okay, whatever, controversial, whatever,
[00:46:48.370] 是啊，我们得搞这些军事干预。好吧，随便吧，有争议的也好，随便吧。
[00:46:52.670] too much. Sorry. But yeah, I do think it's ironic that when you go to other countries,
[00:46:52.670] 太多了。抱歉。不过，我确实觉得很讽刺，当你去其他国家的时候，
[00:47:00.550] they have stronger stereotypes being in homogenous nations, but they're actually more well educated.
[00:47:00.550] 由于生活在同质化国家，他们的刻板印象更为强烈，但实际上他们的受教育程度更高。
[00:47:07.030] And then in the US, you're supposed to have all these understandings of race relations. And if you say
[00:47:07.030] 然后在美国，人们似乎应该对种族关系有各种各样的理解。如果你说
[00:47:14.050] something wrong, or like not updated, people will like rebuke you, or they'll be like,
[00:47:14.050] 如果出了问题，或者内容没有更新，人们会责备你，或者他们会说：
[00:47:18.890] oh, you're stereotyping or whatever. But in reality, that's just an American understanding of things,
[00:47:18.890] 哦，你这是在搞刻板印象什么的。但实际上，那只是美国人看待事物的一种方式。
[00:47:24.570] which is one standpoint.
[00:47:24.570] 这是其中一种观点。
[00:47:26.670] Yeah, it's so true. Like we try to be so woke, but we have like no education on the rest of the world.
[00:47:26.670] 是啊，说得太对了。我们努力装出一副很觉醒的样子，但对世界其他地方却几乎一无所知。
[00:47:32.090] Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:32.090] 对，没错。
[00:47:34.410] And I think the intentions are good. But it's like the reality is we just like don't know shit.
[00:47:34.410] 我觉得他们的出发点是好的。但现实是我们真的什么都不懂。
[00:47:38.150] Yeah, we really don't. I always try to like pick my parents brains about like their childhood. And I'm
[00:47:38.150] 是啊，我们真的没有。我总是想方设法向父母了解他们的童年。而且我
[00:47:44.270] like, dude, there's just so like similar to what you're saying, Jisoo, like there's just so much
[00:47:44.270] 兄弟，你说的跟Jisoo的情况太像了，真的有很多相似之处。
[00:47:48.570] I don't know that they just know. I'm like, how do you know all this Chinese history? And they're
[00:47:48.570] 我不知道他们是不是真的知道。我就想，你们怎么会知道这么多中国历史？他们……
[00:47:53.910] like, dude, we're like, we fucking grew up there. What are you talking about? You know,
[00:47:53.910] 哥们儿，我们可是从小在那儿长大的。你在说什么？你知道，
[00:47:59.450] dude, there's so much Chinese history, Lord, though. It's like thousands of years,
[00:47:59.450] 老兄，中国历史太悠久了，我的天哪。足足有几千年的历史了。
[00:48:02.770] so many arcs, bro.
[00:48:02.770] 剧情线好多啊，兄弟。
[00:48:06.870] Well, I feel like this, this topic is super complex. And it's kind of never ending, too,
[00:48:06.870] 我觉得这个话题非常复杂，而且似乎永远也说不完。
[00:48:12.550] because it's always evolving. But I thought it was pretty fun to like sit down and talk about
[00:48:12.550] 因为它一直在不断发展变化。但我认为坐下来谈谈这件事很有趣。
[00:48:17.230] some of our complex feelings. And I think ultimately, there's so many perspectives and so
[00:48:17.230] 我们一些复杂的情感。而且我认为，归根结底，这其中有很多不同的视角，所以
[00:48:25.530] many facets to this topic that I don't even think it's like black and white where it's like,
[00:48:25.530] 这个话题有很多方面，我觉得它甚至不像黑白分明那样泾渭分明。
[00:48:32.390] oh, you know, this is wrong. This is right. It's just like, oh, these are things that are happening.
[00:48:32.390] 哦，你知道，这是错的，这是对的。就好像，哦，这些事情正在发生。
[00:48:36.290] And how do you feel about it? And like, you know, what is a direction that you personally
[00:48:36.290] 你对此有何感想？比如说，你个人认为应该朝哪个方向发展？
[00:48:41.770] want to go into? So thank you, Jisoo and Yane for sitting down with me and chatting about our
[00:48:41.770] 想深入了解吗？所以，谢谢Jisoo和Yane坐下来和我聊聊我们的事。
