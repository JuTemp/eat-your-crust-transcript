[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Helen.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Helen。
[00:00:05.900] Alright, so we have a familiar voice on today. You might recognize Helen from episode 185,
[00:00:05.900] 好的，今天我们请到了一位熟悉的声音。你可能在第185集中听过海伦的声音。
[00:00:22.830] Girl Talk, Ix and Sticky Situations, where we put Helen in various hypothetical situations
[00:00:22.830] 在“闺蜜闲聊”、“Ix”和“棘手情境”等节目中，我们将海伦置于各种假设情境中。
[00:00:29.210] and pretty much made her decide whether to stay with someone or not. Deal breakers, red flags,
[00:00:29.210] 这几乎让她不得不决定是否要和某人继续在一起。底线、危险信号
[00:00:35.490] and whatnot. So that was a really funny episode. But today we have a little bit of a different
[00:00:35.490] 等等等等。所以那集真的很有趣。但今天我们有点不一样。
[00:00:41.090] topic for you, Helen. And we wanted to talk about friendship, specifically the various values that
[00:00:41.090] 海伦，这个话题给你。我们想谈谈友谊，特别是友谊的各种价值观。
[00:00:48.770] we each kind of carry and hold when we think about friendship. Let's kick this off by starting with a
[00:00:48.770] 当我们想到友谊时，我们每个人都会以某种方式去理解和珍惜。让我们从……开始吧。
[00:00:55.050] very simple but maybe kind of hard to answer question. What does being a good friend mean to
[00:00:55.050] 这是一个很简单但可能有点难回答的问题：做一个好朋友意味着什么？
[00:01:00.950] you? So a good friend, I think that is a very difficult question because everybody has different
[00:01:00.950] 你呢？所以，一个好朋友，我觉得这个问题很难回答，因为每个人对好朋友的定义都不同。
[00:01:07.850] standards for what a good friend is. For me personally, I think it's somebody who really,
[00:01:07.850] 我对好朋友的标准。就我个人而言，我认为好朋友应该是真正……
[00:01:13.150] really truly cares for you and someone who can be loyal. And most importantly, I think someone who
[00:01:13.150] 真正关心你，并且忠诚的人。最重要的是，我认为这个人……
[00:01:20.050] is intentional. Intentional in the sense that like they want to spend time with you, they want to care
[00:01:20.050] 这是有意为之。之所以说是有意为之，是因为他们想花时间陪伴你，想关心你。
[00:01:25.870] for you, they want to put in the effort and just go that extra mile to be there for you. But also,
[00:01:25.870] 他们愿意为你付出努力，竭尽所能地帮助你。但是，
[00:01:32.370] these are the standards that I put on myself to be a good friend to my friend. I think that's my
[00:01:32.370] 这些是我为自己设定的准则，作为朋友的一份子。我觉得这就是我的准则。
[00:01:37.470] definition of a good friend. Yeah, I like that. And I feel like that makes a lot of sense.
[00:01:37.470] 好朋友的定义。嗯，我喜欢这个定义。我觉得这很有道理。
[00:01:42.550] Intentionality, I feel like is something that comes up a little bit more when I think about
[00:01:42.550] 我觉得，当我思考……的时候，意图性这个概念会更多地浮现出来。
[00:01:46.590] friendships now, especially in our adulthood, where all of us are so busy, and we have crazy work
[00:01:46.590] 如今的友谊，尤其是在我们成年之后，大家都非常忙碌，工作也忙得不可开交。
[00:01:51.490] schedules, you might have a lot of obligations, even outside of work that you're keeping up with.
[00:01:51.490] 日程安排方面，你可能有很多义务，即使在工作之外，你也需要兼顾这些义务。
[00:01:56.590] So I think being able to like carve out time for people is a skill, and it truly is a big effort.
[00:01:56.590] 所以我觉得能够抽出时间陪伴别人是一种技能，而且确实需要付出很大的努力。
[00:02:03.990] But something that I kind of think about for this question is, I guess this is a little bit hard
[00:02:03.990] 但我一直在思考这个问题，我觉得这有点难回答。
[00:02:09.190] to conceptualize. But in my mind, a good friend is someone who feels like home. So someone who is
[00:02:09.190] 很难用概念来表达。但在我看来，好朋友就是能让我感到像家一样的人。所以，一个……
[00:02:16.110] not blood related to you, or can be, I guess, but just feel so much like family, and you feel so
[00:02:16.110] 虽然我们之间没有血缘关系，或许以后会有吧，但感觉就像家人一样，你也会有这种感觉。
[00:02:21.210] at peace around them, you feel safe around them and comfortable around them. And I feel like this
[00:02:21.210] 和他们在一起，你会感到平静、安全和舒适。我也有这种感觉。
[00:02:26.610] is something that you can definitely work towards, but it's not something you can force. So to me,
[00:02:26.610] 这是你可以努力争取的事情，但不是你能强求的。所以对我来说，
[00:02:31.990] there's something a little bit under the surface where it's kind of like innate, there's almost like a
[00:02:31.990] 表面之下似乎隐藏着某种东西，有点像是与生俱来的，几乎就像……
[00:02:37.110] base level that you have to meet before you can be really good friends with someone. So that's one
[00:02:37.110] 这是你们成为真正好朋友之前必须达到的基本要求。所以这是第一点。
[00:02:42.010] of the qualities that I think about for a good friend. I think what you both said makes a lot of
[00:02:42.010] 在我看来，好朋友应该具备很多品质。我觉得你们俩说的都很有道理。
[00:02:46.730] sense. Jisoo's idea is kind of like good vibes, like their vibes match with yours. And then I think,
[00:02:46.730] 感觉。Jisoo的想法有点像营造一种好氛围，就像她们的氛围和你的氛围很契合。然后我想，
[00:02:52.830] Helen, you have the other part where it's like you also put in the work. And as you mentioned,
[00:02:52.830] 海伦，还有另一部分，那就是你也付出了努力。正如你提到的，
[00:02:57.290] the intentionality, it definitely matters a lot to see people return the favor kind of or like return
[00:02:57.290] 这种意图非常重要，看到别人以某种方式回报你的好意或类似的方式回应，确实意义重大。
[00:03:04.130] the same effort that you do, so that you can feel like you're not in some sort of one sided or like
[00:03:04.130] 你付出同样的努力，这样你才能感觉自己不是处于某种单方面或类似境地。
[00:03:10.350] unrequited friendship. Because I think I've seen in the past, sometimes with my own situation,
[00:03:10.350] 单相思。因为我觉得我过去曾见过这种情况，有时就我自己的经历而言，
[00:03:16.450] sometimes with other friends of mine situations, where one person is very willing to say, I don't
[00:03:16.450] 有时我和其他朋友之间也会遇到这种情况，一方会很愿意说：“我不……”
[00:03:23.070] know, drive up to SF to hang out, the other party is like, not willing to drive down, you know,
[00:03:23.070] 你知道，开车去旧金山玩，对方却不愿意开车过来。
[00:03:28.950] the other parts of the bay to hang out. And I think that just kind of shows how like priorities differ.
[00:03:28.950] 海湾的其他地方也适合休闲放松。我觉得这正好说明了人们的优先事项有多么不同。
[00:03:34.410] And then it's like, oh, well, why does like only one side of this friendship have to put in the effort
[00:03:34.410] 然后就会想，哦，为什么这段友谊只有一方需要付出努力呢？
[00:03:40.110] all the time to like go up and like travel to hang out when you know, the other side isn't paying
[00:03:40.110] 总是想着去旅行、去闲逛，明明知道对方不付钱。
[00:03:46.050] it forward as well. And I think it's things like that, that shows kind of how much like the friendship
[00:03:46.050] 它也一直延续下去。我认为正是诸如此类的事情，体现了这段友谊有多么深厚。
[00:03:52.670] means to them. I don't know, personally, for me, I kind of take friendship in a very serious way. I try to be
[00:03:52.670] 对他们来说意味着什么。我不知道，就我个人而言，我把友谊看得非常认真。我努力做到……
[00:03:59.870] a good friend and want to try for the people that I truly care about. For example, like if one of my
[00:03:59.870] 一个好朋友，我想为我真正关心的人努力。例如，如果我的一个朋友……
[00:04:05.530] friends was driving up to SF all the time to see me, but let's say like, I just can't go back down to
[00:04:05.530] 朋友们以前总是开车来旧金山看我，但是，比如说，我根本没法再回去了。
[00:04:11.710] East Bay or South Bay to see them, then I will try to make it up in other ways. But I feel like there
[00:04:11.710] 去东湾或南湾看他们，然后我会想办法用其他方式弥补。但我感觉……
[00:04:17.330] always has to be that balanced effort. Yeah, like it doesn't have to be the exact same way that you're
[00:04:17.330] 必须始终保持平衡的努力。是的，就像你不必完全按照你的方式去做……
[00:04:23.010] returning the effort, but just like some way that you're showing you're also invested into the
[00:04:23.010] 回报对方的努力，就像用某种方式表明你也投入其中一样。
[00:04:28.530] friendship, right? Right. Actually, I think that's a really important point. Because even just looking
[00:04:28.530] 友谊，对吧？对。实际上，我认为这非常重要。因为即使只是看看
[00:04:34.530] at our definitions, I feel like they're very similar. But at the same time, it's slightly
[00:04:34.530] 根据我们的定义，我觉得它们非常相似。但同时，它们又略有不同。
[00:04:38.390] different, right? And everyone just has a different definition of a good friend, which means the way
[00:04:38.390] 不一样，对吧？每个人对好朋友的定义都不一样，这意味着方式
[00:04:44.730] that they show their love for a friend can all be very varied. So I think when I was younger, that
[00:04:44.730] 他们表达对朋友的爱的方式多种多样。所以我觉得，当我年轻的时候，
[00:04:51.150] concept was so hard for me to grasp, I would be like, Oh, I feel like I'm putting so much into this
[00:04:51.150] 这个概念对我来说太难理解了，我会想，哦，我觉得我在这上面投入了太多。
[00:04:55.970] friendship because I'm doing all these things. But my friend never does that for me, when in reality,
[00:04:55.970] 因为我做了这么多，所以我的友谊才得以维系。但我的朋友却从未为我做过这些，而事实上，
[00:05:01.090] they are doing it just in their own way. So I feel like even coming to that realization was a journey
[00:05:01.090] 他们只是用自己的方式去做。所以我觉得，即便仅仅是意识到这一点，也是一段旅程。
[00:05:07.890] of like, Oh, not everyone has to be the exact type of friend that I am. And if they were, that would be
[00:05:07.890] 就好像，哦，并不是每个人都必须成为和我一样的朋友。如果他们必须如此，那就……
[00:05:13.890] boring, right? If we were all the same type of person. Wait, that's so true. That's kind of like in
[00:05:13.890] 无聊吧？如果我们都是同一种人的话。等等，这话真没错。这有点像……
[00:05:18.910] relationships. If your love languages aren't the same, you have to like figure out what the best way for
[00:05:18.910] 恋爱关系。如果你们的爱的语言不同，你们就必须弄清楚最好的表达方式。
[00:05:25.070] you to express yourself is in order for your partner to like, feel that love language and like
[00:05:25.070] 你表达自己的方式，是你的伴侣喜欢你、感受到你用这种爱的语言表达爱意的。
[00:05:32.310] feel loved. Because ultimately, friendship is also another form of relationships. Right? Well, on the
[00:05:32.310] 感受被爱。因为归根结底，友谊也是另一种形式的关系。对吧？嗯，在……
[00:05:39.090] flip side, I also want to ask you guys, what do you think it means to be a bad friend?
[00:05:39.090] 另一方面，我也想问问大家，你们觉得做一个坏朋友意味着什么？
[00:05:47.570] Are you kind of talking about like the red flags of a friendship?
[00:05:47.570] 你是不是在说一段友谊中可能出现的危险信号？
[00:05:51.390] Yeah, I think red flags could also work. I think it could also be like, friendships always have their
[00:05:51.390] 是的，我觉得“危险信号”这个说法也说得通。我觉得也可以这样理解，友谊总是会有起伏的。
[00:05:58.210] ups and downs. So what are some signs where you can sense that your friendship is going on like a
[00:05:58.210] 友谊总有起伏。那么，有哪些迹象表明你的友谊正经历着起伏呢？
[00:06:03.190] downturn? I mean, I feel like friendship is also very dynamic, you know, your life changes, their life
[00:06:03.190] 衰退？我的意思是，我觉得友谊也是非常动态的，你知道，你的生活会改变，他们的生活也会改变。
[00:06:11.690] changes. And you guys go through different things. And I think if they're not able to communicate or put
[00:06:11.690] 变化。你们经历的事情也各不相同。我认为如果他们无法沟通或表达自己的想法，那就无法解决问题。
[00:06:19.450] in that effort to communicate with you, then I think that kind of shows that the friendship is kind of
[00:06:19.450] 努力与你沟通，我认为这表明我们的友谊是……
[00:06:25.810] dying down. That was something I had to work on. Because for me, like personally, when I am going through
[00:06:25.810] 慢慢平复下来。这是我需要努力克服的。因为对我个人而言，当我经历……的时候
[00:06:32.390] something, I'm having a hard time, I tend to shut everyone out. And I don't respond to any texts, I just
[00:06:32.390] 我遇到了一些事，我很难过，我总是把自己封闭起来，不理会任何人。我也不回任何短信，我只是
[00:06:37.890] go MIA. I thought that was fine, because I just didn't want to put the burden on my friends. But then on the
[00:06:37.890] 突然失联。我觉得这样没关系，因为我不想给朋友们增加负担。但后来……
[00:06:44.090] flip side, my friends called me out on it. And they were saying, Hey, if you don't tell us that you're going
[00:06:44.090] 另一方面，我的朋友们也指出了这一点。他们说：“嘿，如果你不告诉我们你要去哪儿，我们可就没办法了。”
[00:06:49.750] through something, we're going to keep bothering you. And we're going to keep worrying about you. I was technically
[00:06:49.750] 不管怎样，我们都会继续打扰你，也会继续为你担心。我当时确实……
[00:06:54.530] being like a bad friend. And to them, you know, like they thought like, Oh, does she not want to talk to me
[00:06:54.530] 就像个坏朋友。你知道，他们心里会想，哦，她是不是不想跟我说话？
[00:06:59.990] anymore? You know, like, so maybe on their end, it was like, Oh, maybe our friendship is going down. But that was
[00:06:59.990] 还有吗？你知道，就像，也许在他们那边，他们会想，哦，也许我们的友谊要结束了。但那只是……
[00:07:05.410] totally not my intention. It was just, I just need my own time. But obviously, I failed to communicate that.
[00:07:05.410] 完全不是我的本意。我只是需要一些独处的时间。但显然，我没能把这一点表达清楚。
[00:07:10.290] After that. That's something I've definitely kept in my mind about. But also on the flip side,
[00:07:10.290] 之后的事情我一直铭记在心。但另一方面，
[00:07:16.150] when my friends did that to me, like where they went MIA, I was like, Oh, shit, I'm like in this
[00:07:16.150] 当我的朋友们那样对我，比如突然消失的时候，我就想，哦，糟了，我也被卷进去了。
[00:07:20.250] panic mode of like, did I do something wrong? Like, what's going on? So I think I truly did understand
[00:07:20.250] 我当时陷入了恐慌，心想：我做错什么了吗？到底发生了什么？所以我觉得我真的理解了。
[00:07:27.850] to not be like that. Yeah, I think communication is key.
[00:07:27.850] 不想那样。是的，我认为沟通是关键。
[00:07:33.130] Yeah. And I like how you turned a bad friend moment into a good learning moment, how like your
[00:07:33.130] 是的。我喜欢你把和损友相处的经历转化成一次宝贵的学习机会，就像你一样。
[00:07:39.610] friends called you out? And you're like, Oh, shoot, you're right. Like I should, you know,
[00:07:39.610] 朋友们指出了你的错误？然后你就想，哦，糟了，你说得对。就像我应该……你知道的。
[00:07:42.790] communicate more in the future about that. So I feel like that's not a terrible friend moment,
[00:07:42.790] 以后可以多沟通一下。所以我觉得这不算是朋友之间做错事。
[00:07:48.090] you know, because you really learned from it. And like your friendship strengthened friendment.
[00:07:48.090] 你知道，因为你真的从中学到了很多。而且，你们的友谊也因此更加牢固了。
[00:07:52.570] So I think you're right. If it continued that way with like no communication on either side,
[00:07:52.570] 所以我觉得你说得对。如果双方继续这样下去，没有任何沟通，
[00:07:57.350] it probably would have hurt your friendship overall, without either side even realizing it maybe
[00:07:57.350] 这很可能会对你们的友谊造成伤害，而双方甚至可能都没有意识到这一点。
[00:08:02.570] at first. But I'm also thinking in terms of a bad friendship moment. I think it's along
[00:08:02.570] 一开始是这样。但我也在想，这可能是一段糟糕的友谊经历。我觉得这很常见。
[00:08:09.230] the similar lines as like, you know, lacking communication. If someone just always makes
[00:08:09.230] 类似的情况，比如缺乏沟通。如果有人总是这样。
[00:08:14.430] everything about themselves, if say you're trying to communicate to a friend, and it's just like
[00:08:14.430] 比如说，如果你想和朋友交流，他们会告诉你关于他们自己的一切，就像……
[00:08:19.750] not getting through to them, because they keep trying to like make everything about themselves.
[00:08:19.750] 我没能跟他们沟通好，因为他们总是试图把所有事情都变成关于自己的事。
[00:08:23.650] I feel like that is also like a red flag and in friendships.
[00:08:23.650] 我觉得这在友谊中也算是一个危险信号。
[00:08:27.310] I can totally see that.
[00:08:27.310] 我完全能理解。
[00:08:28.510] I totally agree.
[00:08:28.510] 我完全同意。
[00:08:29.270] Like you are saying something, but you feel like it's not getting heard.
[00:08:29.270] 就像你在说话，但感觉没人听见一样。
[00:08:33.450] Yeah.
[00:08:33.450] 是的。
[00:08:33.690] And I think that's important to like in a friendship, you want to feel seen. That's like
[00:08:33.690] 我觉得在友谊中，被人关注很重要。就像……
[00:08:37.770] 90% of the point of friendship, I feel like so I can see how that's frustrating.
[00:08:37.770] 我觉得这占了友谊的90%，所以我能理解这令人沮丧的原因。
[00:08:42.950] I feel like my bad friend moment is actually kind of opposite of Helen's. I'm thinking back to
[00:08:42.950] 我觉得我遇到的糟糕朋友的经历其实和海伦的经历正好相反。我回想起……
[00:08:50.230] high school college times when I would sometimes like talk to my mom and I would be like, Oh, man,
[00:08:50.230] 高中和大学时期，我有时会想和妈妈聊天，然后我会说，哦，天哪，
[00:08:56.990] like this friend didn't hit me up or like haven't texted me back or like I haven't heard from them.
[00:08:56.990] 就像这位朋友没联系我，也没回我短信，或者我根本没收到他们的消息。
[00:09:02.330] Or I would be like, Oh, this person has been acting really different lately. And it's starting
[00:09:02.330] 或者我会想，哦，这个人最近的行为举止真的很奇怪。而且这种情况开始出现。
[00:09:06.710] to like really get on my nerves. And something that my mom told me once was people go through
[00:09:06.710] 真是太让我恼火了。我妈曾经跟我说过，人都会经历这些事。
[00:09:13.370] so much in their life that you don't always see even if you are like best friends with this person.
[00:09:13.370] 他们的生活中有很多你未必能看到的事情，即使你和这个人是最好的朋友。
[00:09:18.550] So it's really not something that you should try to fully know. You shouldn't feel entitled to
[00:09:18.550] 所以，这真的不是你应该试图完全了解的事情。你不应该觉得自己有权……
[00:09:25.650] know everything that's going on in their life. And if they are going through something,
[00:09:25.650] 了解他们生活中发生的一切。如果他们正在经历某些事情，
[00:09:29.690] then maybe later on, they'll tell you but if not, like who cares, like this person is your friend
[00:09:29.690] 也许过段时间他们会告诉你，但如果他们不告诉你，那又怎样呢，反正这个人是你的朋友。
[00:09:34.090] and someone you care about and you just like let it go and give them the benefit of the doubt.
[00:09:34.090] 对于你关心的人，你只想放手，给予他们信任。
[00:09:37.890] And I don't know, maybe to a lot of people, this comes way more naturally. But to me,
[00:09:37.890] 我不知道，也许对很多人来说，这更容易做到。但对我来说，
[00:09:41.410] it was like a huge learning moment where I was like, Yeah, that is very true. And I think it helped
[00:09:41.410] 那就像一个巨大的学习时刻，我当时就想，是的，确实如此。而且我觉得这很有帮助。
[00:09:46.670] a lot to hear that explicitly from my mom to learn to just accept people as they are. So that's
[00:09:46.670] 我从妈妈那里听到很多这样的话，要学会接受别人本来的样子，这对我影响很大。就是这样。
[00:09:54.210] something that I think about like to this day. And I feel like I have to like constantly channel it a
[00:09:54.210] 直到今天，我仍然会思考这件事。我觉得我必须不断地把它转化为动力。
[00:09:58.870] little bit. But I think if you aren't understanding and you aren't accepting of your friend, you are
[00:09:58.870] 有点儿。但我觉得，如果你不理解、不接受你的朋友，你就是……
[00:10:05.610] being kind of a bad friend to them. Dude, actually, I saw something about that on TikTok. I forgot what
[00:10:05.610] 对他们来说，这算不上什么好朋友。哥们儿，说真的，我在TikTok上看到过类似的。我忘了是什么了。
[00:10:11.470] they called it. But it's basically like, you recognize what your friend's big fatal flaw is,
[00:10:11.470] 他们早就预料到了。但基本上就是，你意识到了你朋友最大的致命缺陷是什么。
[00:10:18.210] and then you learn to accept that. So if it's something like, they're just always late,
[00:10:18.210] 然后你就会学会接受这一点。比如，如果他们总是迟到，
[00:10:22.590] you just learn to accept that. And then you don't let it bother you anymore. You're like,
[00:10:22.590] 你学会接受这一点。然后你就不会再让它困扰你了。你会想，
[00:10:27.310] I recognize that they're just always late. And I won't let that bother myself. And it's just a part
[00:10:27.310] 我知道他们总是迟到。我不会让这件事困扰我。这只是其中的一部分。
[00:10:33.090] of life. And then that takes a lot of pressure off of both sides. Dang, I forgot what it's called.
[00:10:33.090] 生活就是这样。这样一来，双方的压力都会减轻很多。哎呀，我忘了它叫什么了。
[00:10:38.330] But I remember seeing a lot of that on TikTok. And I feel like that's pretty much what your mom is
[00:10:38.330] 但我记得在TikTok上经常看到这种内容。我觉得你妈妈基本上就是这样的。
[00:10:42.430] saying. Right. And I think it's kind of a funny position too. Because on one hand,
[00:10:42.430] 没错。而且我觉得这立场也挺滑稽的。因为一方面，
[00:10:47.510] these are some people who you're like the closest to, right? So I feel like you're in a
[00:10:47.510] 这些人是你最亲近的人，对吧？所以我感觉你现在处于一种……
[00:10:52.590] you can maybe poke fun at their flaws, or you are kind of in a position to be able to like,
[00:10:52.590] 你或许可以取笑他们的缺点，或者你处于一种可以喜欢他们的位置。
[00:10:57.510] call things out if it gets really bad. But at the same time, as someone who is super close to this
[00:10:57.510] 如果情况真的变得很糟糕，就应该指出来。但与此同时，作为一个与此关系非常密切的人，我也深知这一点。
[00:11:03.730] person, you should be the most accepting and the most understanding. So you're kind of at
[00:11:03.730] 作为一个人，你应该是最包容、最善解人意的。所以你现在有点像……
[00:11:08.470] a crossroads, I guess, of options. Sorry, this is kind of off topic. But have you guys heard of light
[00:11:08.470] 我想，这大概是各种选择的十字路口吧。抱歉，这有点跑题了。不过，你们听说过光吗？
[00:11:15.470] gassing? Whoa, no. Is that like gaslighting? So it's a little bit different. Just like quickly
[00:11:15.470] 煤气灯效应？哇，不是吧。那跟煤气灯操纵一样吗？所以有点不一样。就像快速地
[00:11:22.530] saw a TikTok video about it. But it's like a lot of friends that light gas you are actually like
[00:11:22.530] 我在TikTok上看到过一个相关的视频。但就像很多朋友点燃汽油一样，你实际上就像……
[00:11:28.230] toxic friends is what the video was trying to say. It says light gassing is when one person agrees with
[00:11:28.230] 这段视频想表达的是“有毒的朋友”这个概念。它说，轻微的煽动是指一个人同意……
[00:11:33.970] or validates another person's false beliefs or misconceptions in order to be supported.
[00:11:33.970] 或者为了获得支持而认同他人的错误信念或误解。
[00:11:38.910] Oh, you clearly know that what they're thinking is wrong. But you just like keep supporting them
[00:11:38.910] 哦，你明明知道他们的想法是错的，却还是继续支持他们。
[00:11:45.790] just like to be quote unquote, a good friend. So do you guys think that is acceptable?
[00:11:45.790] 我只是想做个“好朋友”。你们觉得这样可以吗？
[00:11:53.790] Personally, for me, like for my friends, I try to be as supportive as possible. But sometimes like
[00:11:53.790] 就我个人而言，就像对待我的朋友们一样，我会尽力给予他们最大的支持。但有时候，比如
[00:12:00.610] my friends get mad at me because I won't support them in certain things that they're truly like
[00:12:00.610] 我的朋友们会生我的气，因为我不支持他们做某些他们真正想做的事情。
[00:12:05.410] passionate about because I'm like, well, I kind of have my own beliefs too. And I think
[00:12:05.410] 我对此充满热情，因为我也觉得自己有自己的信仰。而且我认为
[00:12:09.370] not something I can support you with. But then I know some people that are also like very,
[00:12:09.370] 这件事我帮不上忙。但我认识一些人，他们也像这样，
[00:12:14.930] very supportive of their friends, no matter what they do or no matter what happens.
[00:12:14.930] 无论朋友做什么，无论发生什么，他们都非常支持朋友。
[00:12:20.510] What do you guys think about that in a friendship?
[00:12:20.510] 你们觉得这在友谊中如何体现？
[00:12:23.270] I mean, that's so hard. I think I feel like the instinct almost is two pronged to where it is like,
[00:12:23.270] 我的意思是，这太难了。我觉得这种本能几乎是双重的，就像是……
[00:12:30.810] okay, do I want to hold strong to my own opinions and beliefs slash hold my friend accountable for
[00:12:30.810] 好吧，我是应该坚持自己的观点和信念，还是应该让我的朋友为此负责呢？
[00:12:36.710] like maybe problematic thoughts that they might be sharing. But also at the same time,
[00:12:36.710] 比如他们可能分享的一些有问题的想法。但与此同时，
[00:12:41.290] I feel like I should be a safe space for my friend who feels comfortable enough around me to like,
[00:12:41.290] 我觉得我应该成为朋友的避风港，让朋友在我身边感到足够自在，比如喜欢我。
[00:12:46.390] share these things very like frankly and openly. So I think I can definitely recall some moments
[00:12:46.390] 我会非常坦诚地分享这些事情。所以我想我肯定能回忆起一些时刻。
[00:12:52.050] where I'm like, oh, gosh, I just feel like, yeah, like period. Or should I be like, okay,
[00:12:52.050] 我当时就想，哦，天哪，我感觉就像，嗯，就是这样。或者我应该说，好吧，
[00:12:56.170] let's sit down and have a serious conversation about this. But I don't know. I think my take is
[00:12:56.170] 咱们坐下来认真谈谈这件事吧。但我不知道。我觉得我的看法是……
[00:13:02.690] that if it's not that serious, it's probably fine to just be like, okay, yeah, that's fine. I support
[00:13:02.690] 如果事情没那么严重，那可能就没问题了，就说“好吧，没事儿”。我支持。
[00:13:08.270] you. But if it gets to a certain point and crosses a line, then I feel like I would actually have to sit
[00:13:08.270] 你。但如果事情发展到某个地步，越过一条界限，那我觉得我真的就得坐下来了。
[00:13:13.870] down and have a talk with them.
[00:13:13.870] 下来和他们谈谈。
[00:13:18.150] Yeah, it's pretty tough. My instinct is similar, right? Like I want to support my friend.
[00:13:18.150] 是啊，这确实很难。我的直觉也差不多，对吧？我也想支持我的朋友。
[00:13:23.370] But yeah, probably if it's something that's kind of like, oh, actually, I don't know about that.
[00:13:23.370] 但是，如果是那种“哦，其实，我不太清楚”的情况，那可能就是这种情况。
[00:13:28.490] Maybe I would be more silent and like less supportive.
[00:13:28.490] 也许我会更加沉默，也不会那么支持别人。
[00:13:34.270] Just like like passive. Yeah. Like you keep talking, but I don't know if I'm necessarily
[00:13:34.270] 就像被动的那种。是啊。就像你一直在说，但我不知道我是否真的在听。
[00:13:40.490] supporting this. Maybe they just need someone to listen and not even necessarily agree just
[00:13:40.490] 支持这一点。也许他们只是需要有人倾听，甚至不一定需要同意他们的观点。
[00:13:47.830] for them to like vent. And then you can be like, oh, yeah, I hear what you're saying.
[00:13:47.830] 让他们可以倾诉。然后你就可以说，哦，是的，我明白你的意思。
[00:13:52.950] But I don't know if I agree.
[00:13:52.950] 但我不知道我是否同意。
[00:13:55.630] I think it depends on the friend to actually. Yeah.
[00:13:55.630] 我觉得这取决于朋友的性格。是的。
[00:13:58.390] Some people are more receptive and maybe more open slash maybe might be even seeking feedback on
[00:13:58.390] 有些人更容易接受新观点，也可能更开放，甚至可能正在寻求反馈。
[00:14:04.250] something that they're sharing. But other people might just be like you said, Crystal,
[00:14:04.250] 这是他们共同拥有的东西。但其他人可能就像你说的，克丽丝塔尔，
[00:14:08.150] literally just telling you what's up and not expecting anything back. So it is very case by case.
[00:14:08.150] 我只是告诉你发生了什么，并不期待任何回报。所以具体情况具体分析。
[00:14:13.750] Yeah. Like imagine just this crazy hypothetical where one of your friends is like, dude, I'm
[00:14:13.750] 是啊。想象一下这种疯狂的假设场景，你的一个朋友突然说：“兄弟，我……”
[00:14:19.350] gonna like go kill someone or something like you'd probably be like, holy shit, like pause.
[00:14:19.350] 就像要去杀人一样，你可能会想，我的天哪，然后停下来。
[00:14:25.650] Like, what are you talking about? Don't do that.
[00:14:25.650] 你在说什么？别那样做。
[00:14:29.270] Pause.
[00:14:29.270] 暂停。
[00:14:33.390] So I feel like you're right. Like there's definitely a line where you're just like, OK, actually,
[00:14:33.390] 所以我觉得你是对的。就像确实存在一条界限，过了这条界限你就会想，好吧，实际上
[00:14:37.250] I might have to say something about this. But like maybe sometimes you can just kind of get away
[00:14:37.250] 我可能得就这件事说点什么。但有时候，也许你可以就此逃脱。
[00:14:42.150] with being a little more quiet.
[00:14:42.150] 稍微安静一些。
[00:14:44.450] Yeah, I think it is depending on like what the topic is about.
[00:14:44.450] 是的，我觉得这取决于话题的内容。
[00:14:48.670] I think the most common ones that I've seen is like when they're in like a very toxic relationship
[00:14:48.670] 我觉得最常见的情况是，当他们身处一段非常糟糕的恋爱关系中时。
[00:14:55.790] and they think that the partner is good for them.
[00:14:55.790] 他们认为伴侣对他们有好处。
[00:14:59.410] But clearly, like everything you've seen, everything they tell you is clearly toxic and not good for them.
[00:14:59.410] 但很显然，就像你所看到的一切一样，他们告诉你的一切显然都是有害的，对他们没有好处。
[00:15:05.730] But some friends are just like, oh, yeah, it shows you that much love.
[00:15:05.730] 但有些朋友会说，哦，是啊，这正体现了你对他的爱。
[00:15:09.810] Yeah, you should stay with him. But personally, I would not be like that.
[00:15:09.810] 是啊，你应该和他在一起。但就我个人而言，我不会那样做。
[00:15:14.650] You know, I'd be like, oh, OK, well, he's done this.
[00:15:14.650] 你知道，我当时会想，哦，好吧，他做了这件事。
[00:15:18.350] So like keep that in your head.
[00:15:18.350] 所以你要记住这一点。
[00:15:20.650] You know, I think recently it's just one of my friends was like kind of in a really bad relationship
[00:15:20.650] 你知道，我觉得最近我有个朋友陷入了一段非常糟糕的感情关系。
[00:15:25.550] and like all her other friends have told her, like, oh, don't worry about it.
[00:15:25.550] 就像她其他所有朋友都告诉她的那样，哦，别担心。
[00:15:29.530] Like if you want to stay with him, you should just stay with him.
[00:15:29.530] 如果你想和他在一起，那就应该和他在一起。
[00:15:31.730] But then obviously, like I had a very different opinion about it because I want her to be safe.
[00:15:31.730] 但很显然，我对此有非常不同的看法，因为我希望她安全。
[00:15:37.970] And like, I don't want her to be in a relationship that hurts her.
[00:15:37.970] 而且，我不希望她陷入一段会伤害她的感情关系中。
[00:15:42.630] I was like, oh, my God, is that the definition of light casting from your other friends?
[00:15:42.630] 我当时就想，我的天哪，这就是你其他朋友眼中的“光芒四射”吗？
[00:15:48.130] I feel like in that case, you almost have to like duo with someone and play good cop, bad cop,
[00:15:48.130] 我觉得在这种情况下，你几乎必须和别人组队，扮演好警察和坏警察的角色。
[00:15:53.710] because I do think it's important to sometimes be like, OK, I'm actually not fucking around.
[00:15:53.710] 因为我觉得有时候很重要的一点是，要对自己说：“好吧，我真的不是在开玩笑。”
[00:15:58.470] Like, I think this is very bad for you and unsafe.
[00:15:58.470] 我觉得这样做对你非常不好，也很不安全。
[00:16:02.090] But at the same time, like people need to be there to feel safe to like vent to if things happen
[00:16:02.090] 但与此同时，人们也需要有地方可以倾诉，感到安全，以防发生什么事。
[00:16:08.510] or like not that you are being judging.
[00:16:08.510] 或者说，感觉不像是在被评判。
[00:16:11.510] But I have been in a place where I feel like my friends were in a bad relationship
[00:16:11.510] 但我曾经有过这样的经历，感觉我的朋友们都处于一段糟糕的关系中。
[00:16:15.530] and I was very openly like judgmental about it.
[00:16:15.530] 我当时对此毫不掩饰地表现出评判的态度。
[00:16:18.310] And then later I realized that I was really just alienating them from being OK,
[00:16:18.310] 后来我意识到，我这样做实际上只是让他们更加疏远，让他们无法感到安心。
[00:16:23.770] like coming to me after when things did go wrong because, you know,
[00:16:23.770] 比如事后出了问题，你会来找我，因为，你知道的，
[00:16:27.570] I would be in like a weird position to them, I guess.
[00:16:27.570] 我想，对他们来说，我的处境会很尴尬。
[00:16:31.270] So maybe if you like duo with your friend and you're like, OK, I'm going to put my foot down today,
[00:16:31.270] 所以，如果你喜欢和朋友双排，然后你想，好吧，我今天要坚持我的原则，
[00:16:35.750] but you be the nice person, then it actually works out super well.
[00:16:35.750] 但如果你做一个好人，事情就会进展得非常顺利。
[00:16:39.570] I guess in that case, your friend probably wouldn't want to go talk to you
[00:16:39.570] 我想在这种情况下，你的朋友可能就不想跟你说话了。
[00:16:43.510] because they'll know like you'll say something they don't want to hear,
[00:16:43.510] 因为他们会知道你会说一些他们不想听的话，
[00:16:47.170] even though it is kind of something they should hear.
[00:16:47.170] 虽然这确实是他们应该听到的。
[00:16:50.390] Yeah, I feel like it's pretty tough, too, because like sometimes the friend has to be in the right mindset
[00:16:50.390] 是啊，我也觉得挺难的，因为有时候朋友必须得调整好心态才行。
[00:16:58.050] to take criticisms.
[00:16:58.050] 接受批评。
[00:17:00.030] If they're not ready for that, you kind of just have to like play along
[00:17:00.030] 如果他们还没准备好，那你只能尽量配合他们。
[00:17:03.250] and maybe, I don't know, like subtly hint at these things.
[00:17:03.250] 或许，我不知道，可以委婉地暗示这些事情。
[00:17:07.130] And then later you can be like, oh, I knew it.
[00:17:07.130] 然后过段时间你就可以说，哦，我就知道。
[00:17:11.410] Well, now that we've kind of defined what it looks like to be a good friend
[00:17:11.410] 好了，既然我们已经大致定义了好朋友应该是什么样子。
[00:17:15.670] and also a bad friend in our viewpoints, I want to move into like more action related things.
[00:17:15.670] 而且从我们的角度来看，他也是个糟糕的朋友，我想转向更多与行动相关的事物。
[00:17:22.190] So what is something that you think you try to be proactive about in your friendships
[00:17:22.190] 那么，在友谊中，你觉得你会主动做些什么呢？
[00:17:27.350] or any sort of small thing here and there that you try to make sure you tick the boxes on?
[00:17:27.350] 或者其他一些小细节，比如你为了确保万无一失而做的检查和确认？
[00:17:33.390] For me, like a small thing that I like to do is whenever my friends are going somewhere,
[00:17:33.390] 对我来说，我喜欢做的一件小事就是，每当我的朋友们要去某个地方的时候，
[00:17:40.850] like they're taking a flight or something, I would write it down.
[00:17:40.850] 比如他们要坐飞机之类的，我会记下来。
[00:17:44.050] And then that day I would just text them like safe travel, safe flight.
[00:17:44.050] 那天我就会给他们发短信，比如祝他们旅途平安、飞行安全。
[00:17:48.390] And I would then love them like 10 bucks, like coffee for your early flight or like enjoy a drink.
[00:17:48.390] 然后我会很喜欢它们，比如10美元，就像一杯咖啡，方便你赶早班飞机，或者像喝一杯饮料一样。
[00:17:53.570] Just kind of like that, just to show them that I'm glad they are like on their trip
[00:17:53.570] 就是这样，只是想告诉他们我很高兴他们正在旅行。
[00:17:58.070] or I fully support you having a good time.
[00:17:58.070] 或者，我完全支持你玩得开心。
[00:18:01.950] I think that's like my little action of like trying to be proactive
[00:18:01.950] 我觉得这算是我的一点小行动，算是积极主动一点吧。
[00:18:05.410] and showing that I do care and I am listening.
[00:18:05.410] 表明我确实在乎，而且我在倾听。
[00:18:08.810] That's so cute.
[00:18:08.810] 太可爱了。
[00:18:09.970] That's like what Crystal does actually.
[00:18:09.970] 这其实就是Crystal的日常工作。
[00:18:12.650] Oh, really?
[00:18:12.650] 哦真的吗？
[00:18:13.450] Wait, I don't Venmo 10 bucks though.
[00:18:13.450] 等等，但我没用 Venmo 转过 10 美元。
[00:18:17.650] Helen's above and beyond.
[00:18:17.650] 海伦的表现远超预期。
[00:18:19.710] Helen's like an A plus.
[00:18:19.710] 海伦简直就是个优等生。
[00:18:20.970] I'm like a B plus.
[00:18:20.970] 我大概是B+吧。
[00:18:23.730] But I think I do try to remember generally if someone mentions like,
[00:18:23.730] 但我一般都会尽量记住，如果有人提到类似的事情，比如……
[00:18:27.750] oh, I'm going to be traveling this time.
[00:18:27.750] 哦，这次我要去旅行了。
[00:18:29.130] I'll be like, oh my God, have a safe flight.
[00:18:29.130] 我会想，我的天哪，祝你一路平安。
[00:18:30.930] Yeah, I think it's kind of like what you said.
[00:18:30.930] 是的，我觉得有点像你说的那样。
[00:18:32.590] It's just nice to show them that they're in your thoughts.
[00:18:32.590] 只是想让他们知道你在想着他们。
[00:18:35.370] You remembered what they told you.
[00:18:35.370] 你记住了他们告诉你的话。
[00:18:37.630] You're like paying attention.
[00:18:37.630] 你就像在认真听讲一样。
[00:18:39.470] I mean, I think a easy and very common one is birthday stuff.
[00:18:39.470] 我的意思是，我觉得一个简单又很常见的例子就是生日相关的东西。
[00:18:43.890] So anytime it's someone's birthday, making sure to be there for whatever celebration they're doing
[00:18:43.890] 所以，无论何时是别人的生日，都要确保到场参加他们的任何庆祝活动。
[00:18:48.550] or at the very least, like take them out to dinner or something like that afterwards.
[00:18:48.550] 或者至少，事后请他们吃顿饭什么的。
[00:18:53.010] One that I am bad at, that I've been trying to get a little bit better at is being more supportive on social media.
[00:18:53.010] 我不太擅长的一点，也是我一直在努力改进的一点，就是在社交媒体上给予他人更多支持。
[00:19:01.170] So I'm like not a huge Instagram person, but I have been trying to be more active and like liking people's stories or like responding to them or, you know, leaving like the heart eyes comments on people's posts and stuff.
[00:19:01.170] 我其实不太喜欢用 Instagram，但我一直在努力变得更活跃一些，比如给别人的故事点赞，或者回复他们的动态，或者在别人的帖子下留下点赞之类的评论。
[00:19:17.730] And it's something that I like have to actively remember to do because it's not super first nature to me.
[00:19:17.730] 而且我需要刻意提醒自己去做这件事，因为它对我来说并不是一种本能。
[00:19:23.250] So like interacting over social media.
[00:19:23.250] 就像通过社交媒体互动一样。
[00:19:26.970] This is a good one.
[00:19:26.970] 这个不错。
[00:19:27.970] And I'm like similar to where I want to like comment on friends Instagram posts, but I like don't know what to do.
[00:19:27.970] 我的情况也差不多，我想在朋友的 Instagram 帖子下评论，但我不知道该怎么做。
[00:19:34.710] So I just put a bunch of emojis.
[00:19:34.710] 所以我放了一堆表情符号。
[00:19:36.770] And then sometimes I'm like, dude, this emoji isn't really me.
[00:19:36.770] 有时我会想，老兄，这个表情符号真的不是我。
[00:19:40.110] Because you know how I think like the standard emojis people will post are like heart eyes, hearts, fire, stuff like that.
[00:19:40.110] 因为你知道，我觉得人们常用的表情符号都是心形眼睛、爱心、火焰之类的。
[00:19:49.470] And I'm like, dude, I don't know.
[00:19:49.470] 我当时就想，老兄，我不知道。
[00:19:50.690] That's like not really me.
[00:19:50.690] 那感觉不太像我。
[00:19:54.170] Crystal's like thumbs up.
[00:19:54.170] Crystal 竖起了大拇指。
[00:19:56.250] I'm like sick photo.
[00:19:56.250] 我觉得这张照片很恶心。
[00:19:59.110] Dude, I was laughing my ass off the other day.
[00:19:59.110] 老兄，我前几天笑得肚子都疼了。
[00:20:01.730] You just triggered my memory because one of our friends made like a post and it was like beautiful photos with her and her fiance.
[00:20:01.730] 你刚才勾起了我的回忆，因为我们的一个朋友发了个帖子，里面是她和她未婚夫的漂亮照片。
[00:20:08.970] I was like, oh my God, so cute.
[00:20:08.970] 我当时就想，我的天哪，太可爱了。
[00:20:10.850] But I didn't know what to comment.
[00:20:10.850] 但我不知道该说些什么。
[00:20:11.910] So I just did the very generic teary eyed smiley face, like two of those and the two pink hearts or something.
[00:20:11.910] 所以我画了很普通的含泪笑脸，就像画了两个这样的笑脸，再加上两个粉红色的心形图案之类的。
[00:20:17.990] But Instagram has this feature where if you comment on someone's post, your mutual friends commenting on that same post will notify you.
[00:20:17.990] 但 Instagram 有一个功能，如果你评论了某人的帖子，你们共同的朋友如果评论了同一帖子，就会通知你。
[00:20:26.630] Right.
[00:20:26.630] 正确的。
[00:20:26.890] So I got a notification.
[00:20:26.890] 我收到了一条通知。
[00:20:28.270] It was like Crystal also commented the same two emojis, but order swapped.
[00:20:28.270] 就像 Crystal 也评论了同样的两个表情符号，但顺序颠倒了。
[00:20:34.650] And I was like, holy fuck.
[00:20:34.650] 我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:20:39.190] Wait, I fucking saw that.
[00:20:39.190] 等等，我他妈的看到了。
[00:20:41.530] After I posted, I like scrolled up a bit and I was like, oh my God, Jisoo posted the exact same comment as me.
[00:20:41.530] 我发完帖子后，往上翻了翻，然后我就想，我的天哪，Jisoo 发了和我一模一样的评论。
[00:20:47.090] I was like, fuck.
[00:20:47.090] 我当时就想，卧槽。
[00:20:51.250] Unintentional.
[00:20:51.250] 无意的。
[00:20:52.110] Yeah.
[00:20:52.110] 是的。
[00:20:54.030] Oh my God.
[00:20:54.030] 我的天啊。
[00:20:55.590] Hey, that means you guys think alike.
[00:20:55.590] 嘿，那说明你们想法一致。
[00:20:57.470] That's true.
[00:20:57.470] 这是真的。
[00:20:58.390] It means we're both trying.
[00:20:58.390] 这意味着我们都在努力。
[00:21:00.530] We're both awkward on social media.
[00:21:00.530] 我们俩都不擅长使用社交媒体。
[00:21:04.570] Oh, but yeah, the social media one is a good one.
[00:21:04.570] 哦，对啊，社交媒体那条确实不错。
[00:21:07.390] Anything else you guys try to do?
[00:21:07.390] 你们还尝试过其他方法吗？
[00:21:10.310] I think one of my top love languages for like friendship and for relationships is gifts.
[00:21:10.310] 我认为，在友谊和恋爱关系中，我最主要的表达爱的方式之一就是送礼物。
[00:21:17.250] So I think sometimes if I'm like traveling or just out and I see something that I like know a specific friend likes, then I'll try to pick it up for them and like give it to them the next time I see them.
[00:21:17.250] 所以我觉得有时候如果我在旅行或者外出的时候看到我喜欢的东西，而我知道某个朋友也喜欢，那么我就会试着买下来，下次见到他们的时候送给他们。
[00:21:29.630] I remember one time I was at a Pop Mart or something and I saw these Miffy blind boxes and I was like, oh my God, my friend is obsessed with Miffy.
[00:21:29.630] 我记得有一次我在一家便利店之类的地方，看到了这些米菲盲盒，当时我就想，我的天哪，我的朋友迷上了米菲。
[00:21:37.590] Let me just pick one of these up for her.
[00:21:37.590] 我给她买一个吧。
[00:21:39.550] Kind of stuff like that.
[00:21:39.550] 诸如此类的事情。
[00:21:40.710] That's actually really sweet because it shows that you're like thinking of them even when you're not with them.
[00:21:40.710] 这真的很贴心，因为它表明即使你不和他们在一起，你也会想着他们。
[00:21:46.430] Sometimes, okay, like money, budget.
[00:21:46.430] 有时候，好吧，就像钱、预算一样。
[00:21:48.670] If I can't buy for them, I'll just take a picture and be like, oh my God, this reminds me of you.
[00:21:48.670] 如果我不能给他们买礼物，我就拍张照片，然后说，哦，天哪，这让我想起了你。
[00:21:53.170] Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:53.170] 是啊是啊。
[00:21:54.150] Yeah, that's true.
[00:21:54.150] 是的，没错。
[00:21:54.950] I'm not like out here trying to buy super expensive stuff.
[00:21:54.950] 我又不是那种到处买超级贵东西的人。
[00:21:57.890] Usually it's like, you know, a small token.
[00:21:57.890] 通常来说，你知道，就是一个小小的纪念品。
[00:22:01.410] Like a couple dollars or something like that.
[00:22:01.410] 大概几美元之类的。
[00:22:04.930] That's a good one though.
[00:22:04.930] 这确实是个好主意。
[00:22:05.990] I think like whether it's a photo of something or a physical gift, it's so sweet to think about your friend elsewhere doing stuff with other people and just like having you in their mind.
[00:22:05.990] 我觉得，无论是照片还是实物礼物，想到你的朋友在别处和别人一起做事情，却依然想着你，这真的很甜蜜。
[00:22:16.250] It's like, oh my God, I'm so special.
[00:22:16.250] 感觉就像，我的天哪，我太特别了。
[00:22:19.950] You got this for me or you thought of me?
[00:22:19.950] 这是你特意为我准备的，还是你想到了我？
[00:22:22.710] Yeah.
[00:22:22.710] 是的。
[00:22:23.470] I think in that same sense, I almost feel like memes or like TikToks and sending that to friends can also be a huge love language because it's like I could have said this to anyone on my list.
[00:22:23.470] 我觉得从某种意义上来说，表情包或者TikTok之类的视频，发给朋友也可以是一种表达爱意的语言，因为感觉就像我可以把这些话告诉名单上的任何人一样。
[00:22:34.990] But I chose to send it to you.
[00:22:34.990] 但我选择把它寄给你。
[00:22:36.650] Like there's intentionality and meaning behind that too.
[00:22:36.650] 仿佛这背后也有某种意图和意义。
[00:22:39.890] And you guys like share the same humor.
[00:22:39.890] 你们的幽默感很相似。
[00:22:42.130] Yeah.
[00:22:42.130] 是的。
[00:22:43.330] Okay, this is kind of a funny one.
[00:22:43.330] 好吧，这有点搞笑。
[00:22:45.290] But we recently just did an episode about fantasy football because Jisoo and I are doing fantasy for the first time this year with a bunch of our friends.
[00:22:45.290] 但我们最近做了一期关于梦幻足球的节目，因为我和Jisoo今年第一次和一群朋友一起玩梦幻足球。
[00:22:53.990] And I've only kind of started doing this, but sometimes when Jisoo's players are like injured or like coming back from injury, I'll text her like the tweet update.
[00:22:53.990] 我才刚开始做这件事，但有时候当 Jisoo 的队员受伤或伤愈复出时，我会给她发短信，就像推特更新一样。
[00:23:05.630] I'll be like, hey, your players like coming back soon.
[00:23:05.630] 我会说，嘿，你们的球员们很快就会回来。
[00:23:08.530] I'm like, oh my God, this is news to me.
[00:23:08.530] 我当时就想，我的天哪，这我还是第一次听说。
[00:23:10.510] Thank you, Crystal.
[00:23:10.510] 谢谢你，克丽丝塔尔。
[00:23:12.010] You don't even know your own player.
[00:23:12.010] 你甚至都不了解自己的球员。
[00:23:13.830] I'm like the girls in this league need to win.
[00:23:13.830] 我觉得这个联赛里的女孩们都需要赢球。
[00:23:18.450] That is very sweet.
[00:23:18.450] 真贴心。
[00:23:19.610] Oh my God.
[00:23:19.610] 我的天啊。
[00:23:20.010] The other day, Crystal texted me like paragraphs of analysis about this one trade that happened in our league.
[00:23:20.010] 前几天，克里斯特尔给我发了好几段文字，分析了我们联盟里发生的一笔交易。
[00:23:25.090] And I was like, this is actually labor of love.
[00:23:25.090] 我当时就想，这真的是出于热爱而做的。
[00:23:28.050] Like who would do this for their friend?
[00:23:28.050] 谁会为朋友做这种事？
[00:23:31.530] She really, really cares about you.
[00:23:31.530] 她真的很关心你。
[00:23:34.670] Which I think actually leads pretty well into the next question that I have for you guys, which are like green flags for friendship.
[00:23:34.670] 我认为这其实很好地引出了我要问你们的下一个问题，这就像友谊的绿灯一样。
[00:23:41.550] And I think that fantasy football analysis example is actually a really good one because with friends, some of the things that I've done for my friends or my friends have done for me, if I sit down and think about it, I just get so touched of like, wow, this person really cares for me.
[00:23:41.550] 我觉得用梦幻足球分析来举例其实挺好的，因为对于朋友来说，我为朋友做过的一些事，或者朋友为我做过的一些事，如果我坐下来仔细想想，我就会非常感动，心想，哇，这个人真的很关心我。
[00:23:57.990] And went out of their way to do something for me or for us and took time out of their day.
[00:23:57.990] 他们特意抽出时间为我或我们做事。
[00:24:04.190] And I think that's a huge green flag.
[00:24:04.190] 我认为这绝对是个好兆头。
[00:24:05.990] Someone who is generous with their time, their attention, money sometimes, and is willing to kind of put that and invest it into your friendship.
[00:24:05.990] 一个慷慨付出时间、精力和金钱的人，愿意将这些投入到你们的友谊中。
[00:24:15.250] Oh, I think a good green flag is people are willing to do any like small favors that you might ask of them.
[00:24:15.250] 哦，我认为一个好的信号是，人们愿意为你做你可能提出的任何小忙。
[00:24:23.530] Maybe something as simple as, oh, we're about to like carpool somewhere.
[00:24:23.530] 也许是像“哦，我们准备拼车去某个地方”这样简单的话。
[00:24:27.310] Can you bring me a bottle of water?
[00:24:27.310] 你能给我拿瓶水吗？
[00:24:30.090] You know, just signs that they're willing to like put in some effort to do a small favor for you.
[00:24:30.090] 你知道，这只是表明他们愿意花些心思为你做点小事的迹象。
[00:24:35.750] I feel like as I get older, time is like a huge gift from your friends.
[00:24:35.750] 我觉得随着年龄增长，时间就像朋友们送给我的一份厚礼。
[00:24:43.650] And then second is that actions just speak so much louder than words.
[00:24:43.650] 其次，行动胜于雄辩。
[00:24:48.230] Even the small favors that you were talking about means so much more than like when I was younger.
[00:24:48.230] 即使是你刚才提到的那些小恩小惠，对我来说也比我小时候要重要得多。
[00:24:53.090] I think another like green flag for friendship is a friend that can truly celebrate your wins.
[00:24:53.090] 我认为友谊的另一个好兆头是，朋友能够真心为你取得的成就而庆祝。
[00:25:01.290] They're just as happy for you.
[00:25:01.290] 他们也同样为你感到高兴。
[00:25:04.270] They're like truly, truly like happy for you or they really support you.
[00:25:04.270] 他们真的、真的为你感到高兴，或者他们真的非常支持你。
[00:25:08.990] Yeah, I think I like realized that recently just because I had some big milestones.
[00:25:08.990] 是的，我觉得我最近才意识到这一点，因为我取得了一些重要的里程碑式成就。
[00:25:14.850] And I don't know if you felt it for your wedding, Jisoo, because that's like another milestone for your life.
[00:25:14.850] 智秀，我不知道你结婚的时候有没有这种感觉，因为那就像是你人生中的另一个里程碑。
[00:25:19.410] But it's like in those big moments, you can tell who's truly, truly happy for you and who is just like there for you.
[00:25:19.410] 但就像在那些重要时刻，你能分辨出谁是真心为你高兴，谁只是陪在你身边而已。
[00:25:28.190] That's when I was touched by like some of my friends.
[00:25:28.190] 那时，我的一些朋友让我很感动。
[00:25:30.410] I'm like, oh my gosh, I didn't think you'd be this happy for me, but you are.
[00:25:30.410] 我当时就想，我的天哪，我没想到你会这么为我高兴，但你真的很高兴。
[00:25:34.930] And I'm so thankful for that, you know.
[00:25:34.930] 你知道，我对此非常感激。
[00:25:37.810] That's a good one.
[00:25:37.810] 那真是个好主意。
[00:25:39.050] Yeah, I remember seeing some friends cry at the wedding.
[00:25:39.050] 是的，我记得在婚礼上看到一些朋友哭了。
[00:25:42.990] And I think it is common for people to like tear up here and there at weddings.
[00:25:42.990] 我觉得人们在婚礼上时不时地流泪是很正常的。
[00:25:47.910] But I saw one of our friends cry and I was like so shocked that she was crying.
[00:25:47.910] 但我看到我们的一位朋友哭了，我当时非常震惊，没想到她竟然哭了。
[00:25:53.510] And I was thinking about it and I was like, yeah, that is like a marker of a very good friend.
[00:25:53.510] 我当时想了想，觉得，是啊，这就像是一个非常好朋友的标志。
[00:25:57.710] Like you said, people who are very, very happy for you in big moments.
[00:25:57.710] 正如你所说，在人生重要时刻，总有人会为你感到非常非常高兴。
[00:26:00.630] And I think the way that it touched me was like she looked just as happy as she would have been for like her own wedding, you know.
[00:26:00.630] 我觉得最让我感动的是，她看起来就像是自己结婚时一样开心。
[00:26:09.250] And I was like, wow, that's like a very rare thing to see.
[00:26:09.250] 我当时就想，哇，这真是太罕见了。
[00:26:12.610] So I can totally resonate with that.
[00:26:12.610] 所以我完全能理解。
[00:26:14.570] It's like the genuine, genuineness.
[00:26:14.570] 就像那种真诚、纯粹的感觉。
[00:26:18.310] I don't know what that word is.
[00:26:18.310] 我不知道那个词是什么。
[00:26:21.030] I think another green flag for friendship that I've seen in my life is actually people who check in a lot.
[00:26:21.030] 我认为，我在生活中看到的友谊的另一个好兆头是那些经常主动联系的人。
[00:26:28.590] I think the older I get, the more I have to like sit down and think and remember to check in with people.
[00:26:28.590] 我觉得年纪越大，就越需要坐下来好好思考，并且记得要关心身边的人。
[00:26:35.230] So I know how much thought that actually takes.
[00:26:35.230] 所以我知道这实际上需要多少思考。
[00:26:39.710] It's not just like a simple action and gesture, even though sometimes it might feel like that.
[00:26:39.710] 它不仅仅是一个简单的动作和姿势，尽管有时感觉上可能如此。
[00:26:44.390] I feel like you actually have to kind of sit down and be like, oh, I haven't talked to this person in a while.
[00:26:44.390] 我觉得你真的需要坐下来好好想想，比如，“哦，我已经很久没和这个人联系了。”
[00:26:47.570] I'm going to check in.
[00:26:47.570] 我要去办理入住手续。
[00:26:48.210] So now when my friends do it to me, especially people who live further away or might be super busy with their own lives, I do get really touched.
[00:26:48.210] 所以现在当我的朋友们这样做时，特别是那些住得比较远或者自己生活非常忙碌的朋友，我真的会非常感动。
[00:26:56.730] And I think that's a huge green flag.
[00:26:56.730] 我认为这绝对是个好兆头。
[00:26:59.110] And I think it's harder with long distance friendships because obviously you guys can't hang out as much.
[00:26:59.110] 我觉得异地友谊更难维系，因为很明显你们不能经常见面。
[00:27:04.610] You have to figure out other ways to kind of keep in touch or to check in with one another.
[00:27:04.610] 你们得想办法保持联系或者互相问候。
[00:27:10.190] I feel like long distance friendship is a whole different thing, too.
[00:27:10.190] 我觉得异地友谊也完全是另一回事。
[00:27:14.210] True.
[00:27:14.210] 真的。
[00:27:14.990] Yeah, good point.
[00:27:14.990] 是啊，说得对。
[00:27:16.330] I think maybe this is kind of in line with what we said earlier towards the beginning of the episode.
[00:27:16.330] 我觉得这可能和我们在本集开头所说的内容有点一致。
[00:27:21.790] But someone who like takes time to really understand your personality and how that might fit with theirs.
[00:27:21.790] 但真正喜欢你的人会花时间去真正了解你的个性，以及你的个性是否与他们的个性相契合。
[00:27:31.670] So, for example, if maybe you're more of an introvert and your friend is more of an extrovert, they understand that they can't always just push you to like go out with them.
[00:27:31.670] 例如，如果你比较内向，而你的朋友比较外向，他们就会明白他们不能总是强迫你和他们一起出去玩。
[00:27:42.230] I think that is like definitely a green flag.
[00:27:42.230] 我认为这绝对是一个好兆头。
[00:27:44.890] I guess to put it into shorter words is like that they recognize and respect boundaries.
[00:27:44.890] 简单来说，就是他们懂得尊重界限。
[00:27:53.030] Yeah, I think respecting each other's boundaries is like another huge important factor in a friendship just because everybody has different needs and wants, too.
[00:27:53.030] 是的，我认为尊重彼此的界限是友谊中另一个非常重要的因素，因为每个人都有不同的需求和愿望。
[00:28:03.970] Yeah, I think it's like we've been kind of saying it throughout the episode how everyone shows their love and care in different ways.
[00:28:03.970] 是的，我觉得就像我们在整集节目中一直在强调的那样，每个人都以不同的方式表达爱和关心。
[00:28:11.130] And everyone is also just like a different person in general.
[00:28:11.130] 而且每个人本质上也都像是不同的人。
[00:28:14.450] So it's like we have to recognize and accept that.
[00:28:14.450] 所以我们必须认识到并接受这一点。
[00:28:17.510] And then that's where like friendship really starts to bloom.
[00:28:17.510] 然后，友谊就开始真正萌芽了。
[00:28:20.670] Do you guys have any experiences where you had to kind of explicitly draw out boundaries or maybe the reverse?
[00:28:20.670] 你们有没有过这样的经历：需要明确地划清界限，或者反过来？
[00:28:28.370] Someone had to kind of sit down and set boundaries with you?
[00:28:28.370] 是不是得有人坐下来跟你好好谈谈，划清界限？
[00:28:31.290] Or I guess even times where you thought about it and then you were like, I should really set boundaries.
[00:28:31.290] 或者我想，甚至有时候你会思考这个问题，然后你会想，我真的应该设定一些界限。
[00:28:35.670] And then you decided not to do anything.
[00:28:35.670] 然后你决定什么都不做。
[00:28:38.130] I think setting boundaries is definitely one of the things I struggle with the most.
[00:28:38.130] 我认为设定界限绝对是我最难做到的事情之一。
[00:28:43.830] I'm just more of a private person when it comes to certain things.
[00:28:43.830] 我在某些事情上比较注重隐私。
[00:28:47.670] And I just like to keep it to myself.
[00:28:47.670] 我只想把它藏在心里。
[00:28:50.610] As I said earlier, like I realized I have to communicate that or else the other person might not know.
[00:28:50.610] 正如我之前所说，我意识到我必须把这件事表达出来，否则对方可能就不知道了。
[00:28:56.770] Like you know how some friends are very, very open and they will just yap and yap and yap almost everything and anything.
[00:28:56.770] 你知道有些朋友非常非常健谈，他们会喋喋不休地谈论几乎所有事情。
[00:29:03.810] And for them, that's great because like I love listening to that.
[00:29:03.810] 对他们来说，这很棒，因为我也很喜欢听。
[00:29:06.850] But at the same time, like please don't expect me to do the same because I don't share everything.
[00:29:06.850] 但同时，请不要指望我也会这样做，因为我不会分享所有事情。
[00:29:12.010] There are just certain things I don't want to share.
[00:29:12.010] 有些事我不想跟人分享。
[00:29:14.890] Once again, like communication is key to setting those boundaries.
[00:29:14.890] 再次强调，沟通是设定这些界限的关键。
[00:29:17.730] I think communication is really hard though.
[00:29:17.730] 我觉得沟通真的很难。
[00:29:21.950] And it's hard for me to think of times where there was explicit boundary setting.
[00:29:21.950] 我很难想起有明确设定界限的时期。
[00:29:28.030] But I feel like in a lot of ways, maybe there were like passive boundaries that were set.
[00:29:28.030] 但我感觉在很多方面，可能存在一些被动设定的界限。
[00:29:33.990] So not verbally explicitly communicated, but maybe through actions or even like reactions to stuff.
[00:29:33.990] 所以，不是通过口头明确表达，而是通过行动，甚至是对事物的反应来表达。
[00:29:42.070] I feel like there has been boundary setting in friendships.
[00:29:42.070] 我觉得友谊中出现了界限划分。
[00:29:44.930] So one example I can think of is maybe there's a touchy subject with someone.
[00:29:44.930] 我能想到的一个例子是，也许你和某人之间有一个敏感话题。
[00:29:50.190] And then you kind of slowly learn to not bring that up or not talk about it in like a specific manner.
[00:29:50.190] 然后你慢慢地就学会了不去提起这件事，或者不以某种特定的方式谈论这件事。
[00:29:57.390] You know, like maybe don't joke about that, but you can talk about it delicately, that kind of thing.
[00:29:57.390] 你知道，比如也许不要拿这个开玩笑，但你可以委婉地谈论它，诸如此类。
[00:30:01.950] Another thing that I've experienced on both sides actually is like frequency of hangouts.
[00:30:01.950] 我在双方都经历过的另一件事是聚会的频率。
[00:30:07.370] I feel like it's something that kind of has to be compromised on.
[00:30:07.370] 我觉得这件事必须做出一些妥协。
[00:30:11.410] So Crystal, you talking about an introvert is a good example.
[00:30:11.410] 所以克丽丝塔尔，你提到的内向者就是一个很好的例子。
[00:30:14.050] Like some people might not want to hang out that much or might be super, super busy with their schedule.
[00:30:14.050] 有些人可能不太想经常出去玩，或者日程安排非常非常忙。
[00:30:19.350] And other people might feel more joy the more you see them, you know.
[00:30:19.350] 你知道吗？而且，你越是经常见到别人，他们可能就越开心。
[00:30:23.330] So then I feel like aligning on something like that as subtle and as passive as it may be is still a form of boundary setting that I think is important.
[00:30:23.330] 所以我觉得，像这样达成共识，即使它很微妙、很被动，仍然是一种设定界限的方式，我认为这很重要。
[00:30:33.090] I guess another one could be when you need to leave a hangout.
[00:30:33.090] 我想另一种情况可能是当你需要离开聚会地点的时候。
[00:30:39.450] Sometimes, you know, you go into a hangout, you're like, okay, I need to leave early today because I have something going on the next day or something of that sort.
[00:30:39.450] 有时候，你知道，你去某个地方聚会，你会想，好吧，我今天得早点离开，因为我第二天有事要办，或者诸如此类的事情。
[00:30:48.270] That is kind of a boundary.
[00:30:48.270] 那算是一种界限。
[00:30:50.390] And it does sometimes get difficult at the end of the night.
[00:30:50.390] 到了晚上，有时确实会变得很困难。
[00:30:54.470] But like knowing when to be like, okay, we like got to go or like I got to go and letting that person go is definitely a more lighthearted version of boundaries.
[00:30:54.470] 但就像知道什么时候该说“好吧，我们得走了”或者“我得走了”，然后放那个人走一样，这绝对是界限的一种更轻松的表达方式。
[00:31:06.690] When situations like that happen, how do you guys tell people to leave?
[00:31:06.690] 遇到这种情况，你们会怎么请人离开？
[00:31:11.550] I think the easiest way sometimes is if you tell someone else who's like also an attendee versus the host and you're like, okay, dude, like I think I'm going to try to leave at like 10 p.m. today.
[00:31:11.550] 我觉得最简单的办法有时候是告诉另一个也是与会者的人，而不是主办方，然后说：“好吧，伙计，我今天晚上10点左右打算离开。”
[00:31:24.010] The other person might be like, oh, my God, me too.
[00:31:24.010] 对方可能会想，哦，我的天哪，我也是。
[00:31:26.290] That sounds good.
[00:31:26.290] 听起来很好。
[00:31:27.070] Let's keep each other accountable.
[00:31:27.070] 让我们互相监督。
[00:31:28.650] And then once 10 p.m. hits, then you look towards them.
[00:31:28.650] 然后，一旦到了晚上10点，你就会看向他们。
[00:31:31.810] You're like, should we go?
[00:31:31.810] 你会想，我们该走吗？
[00:31:32.750] It's like 10 p.m.
[00:31:32.750] 现在大概是晚上10点。
[00:31:35.090] And then I think it goes either two ways.
[00:31:35.090] 我觉得结果有两种可能。
[00:31:37.150] Either one, the other person's like, oh, my God, you should go ahead.
[00:31:37.150] 无论哪种情况，对方都会说：“哦，我的天哪，你应该继续。”
[00:31:40.230] I'll cover for you.
[00:31:40.230] 我会替你掩护。
[00:31:41.270] Like go just sneak out or something.
[00:31:41.270] 比如偷偷溜出去什么的。
[00:31:42.990] Right.
[00:31:42.990] 正确的。
[00:31:44.110] Or they're like, oh, my God.
[00:31:44.110] 或者他们会说，哦，我的天哪。
[00:31:45.450] Yeah, like let's go.
[00:31:45.450] 对，我们走吧。
[00:31:46.330] Or maybe they're like, give me like 10 minutes.
[00:31:46.330] 或者他们会说，给我10分钟时间。
[00:31:48.070] Let me just say bye.
[00:31:48.070] 我就说再见吧。
[00:31:48.770] And then let's head out.
[00:31:48.770] 然后我们就出发吧。
[00:31:50.150] And I feel like that usually works out well because you have like the backup to defend if any other attendee or host is like, wait, no, please stay.
[00:31:50.150] 我觉得这样做通常效果很好，因为如果有其他与会者或主持人说“等等，不，请留下来”，你就有后备方案来捍卫你的观点。
[00:31:59.670] No, we got to go.
[00:31:59.670] 不，我们得走了。
[00:32:01.710] Again, the duoing method is foolproof.
[00:32:01.710] 再次强调，双人合作的方法万无一失。
[00:32:04.830] I know.
[00:32:04.830] 我知道。
[00:32:06.350] Dude, even better if it's like you bring an SO and you're like, oh, no, actually, it's not even me.
[00:32:06.350] 老兄，如果你带了个伴侣来，然后你却说，哦，不，其实那根本不是我，那就更好了。
[00:32:11.410] It's like them, you know, like they have something to do.
[00:32:11.410] 你知道，他们就是这样，好像总有事要做似的。
[00:32:14.510] Yes.
[00:32:14.510] 是的。
[00:32:16.290] All the blame goes to them.
[00:32:16.290] 所有责任都在他们身上。
[00:32:19.430] So what happens if you do set boundaries with a friend and it doesn't work out?
[00:32:19.430] 如果你和朋友划清界限，但结果却不尽如人意，那该怎么办？
[00:32:23.890] Is that a huge red slash yellow flag?
[00:32:23.890] 那是一面巨大的红黄相间的旗帜吗？
[00:32:25.970] I think that's a pretty yellow flag because that means they're not respecting you.
[00:32:25.970] 我认为这是一个非常危险的信号，因为这意味着他们不尊重你。
[00:32:31.170] I think it also depends on the boundary, like how severe the boundary or how important the boundary is, because if it's like a pretty big one and they're like not respecting it, it's probably starting to border more on like red.
[00:32:31.170] 我认为这还取决于界限，比如界限有多严格或者有多重要，因为如果界限很大，而他们却不尊重它，那情况可能就开始接近红色警戒线了。
[00:32:44.190] But if it's like kind of inconsequential, it might be a little more like yellowish beige.
[00:32:44.190] 但如果无关紧要的话，颜色可能更接近黄褐色。
[00:32:52.950] I guess it could also be like if you try to passively set boundaries first and that doesn't work out.
[00:32:52.950] 我想这也可能就像你先尝试被动地设定界限，但结果却行不通一样。
[00:32:59.970] The next step is to like explicitly do it.
[00:32:59.970] 下一步就是明确地去做。
[00:33:03.110] So maybe switching up the seriousness of how you're setting the boundaries could also kind of help move things along.
[00:33:03.110] 所以，或许改变一下你设定界限时的严肃程度，也能帮助事情向前发展。
[00:33:10.950] Yeah, that's true.
[00:33:10.950] 是的，没错。
[00:33:12.430] I feel like the closer you are to a friend, the easier it is to set boundaries.
[00:33:12.430] 我觉得和朋友关系越亲密，就越容易设定界限。
[00:33:18.550] Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:18.550] 是啊是啊。
[00:33:19.450] Because usually they're like very understanding.
[00:33:19.450] 因为他们通常都很善解人意。
[00:33:23.370] Or like you just know how to approach that person.
[00:33:23.370] 或者就像你天生就知道该如何接近那个人。
[00:33:27.010] True.
[00:33:27.010] 真的。
[00:33:27.570] It's just like a lot easier.
[00:33:27.570] 这样容易多了。
[00:33:28.870] But I think it's always like newer friendships that is harder just because like you don't know how to say it or you don't know how to hint it.
[00:33:28.870] 但我认为，新建立的友谊总是更难维系，因为你不知道该如何表达，或者不知道该如何暗示。
[00:33:37.010] Or like.
[00:33:37.010] 或者类似。
[00:33:37.990] Oh, that's so true.
[00:33:37.990] 哦，说得太对了。
[00:33:39.970] Because now that I'm thinking about it, sometimes boundaries are maybe set up a little more subtly over time.
[00:33:39.970] 因为现在想想，有时候界限的建立可能需要一些时间，而且会变得更加微妙。
[00:33:48.030] Like kind of what Jisoo was saying earlier.
[00:33:48.030] 就像Jisoo之前说的那样。
[00:33:50.310] Sometimes you just slowly learn like this is a sensitive topic for this friend.
[00:33:50.310] 有时候你会慢慢发现，这对这位朋友来说是一个敏感话题。
[00:33:55.130] So let's not talk too much about it or like approach it delicately.
[00:33:55.130] 所以我们还是别过多谈论这件事，或者委婉地处理它吧。
[00:34:00.510] But with a new friend, they might not know.
[00:34:00.510] 但如果是新朋友，他们可能就不知道了。
[00:34:03.850] And so if they like come in barreling through this topic, you're kind of like, oh, well, they don't know.
[00:34:03.850] 所以如果他们贸然闯入这个话题，你就会想，哦，好吧，他们不懂。
[00:34:09.690] So it's like fine.
[00:34:09.690] 所以一切都很好。
[00:34:11.810] I think you have a really good point there, Helen.
[00:34:11.810] 海伦，我觉得你说的很有道理。
[00:34:14.550] Sometimes in the beginning, these boundaries haven't even had time to like get set yet.
[00:34:14.550] 有时候，在初期，这些界限甚至还没有时间确立。
[00:34:20.030] And like they just get broken through.
[00:34:20.030] 就像它们突然被突破了一样。
[00:34:22.030] That's true.
[00:34:22.030] 这是真的。
[00:34:22.850] It's like no man's land.
[00:34:22.850] 这里就像一片无人区。
[00:34:23.990] But like older friendships, you have like a map already.
[00:34:23.990] 但就像老朋友之间的友谊一样，你们之间已经有了一张地图。
[00:34:26.850] Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:26.850] 是啊是啊。
[00:34:27.370] Yeah.
[00:34:27.370] 是的。
[00:34:28.670] Do you guys have any other yellow or red flags?
[00:34:28.670] 你们还有其他需要注意的警示信号吗？
[00:34:31.990] I think if they're really flaky in the beginning stages of your friendship, when you're trying to build your friendship up and they're being really flaky, it can feel hurtful because you're like, oh, I was excited about this friendship.
[00:34:31.990] 我认为，如果在友谊的初期阶段，当你们努力建立友谊的时候，对方却很反复无常，这会让人感到受伤，因为你会想，哦，我对这段友谊充满期待。
[00:34:46.910] But why is everything always getting pushed back or like canceled?
[00:34:46.910] 但为什么所有事情总是被推迟或取消呢？
[00:34:51.270] And I think it like kills the momentum really quickly.
[00:34:51.270] 我觉得这会很快扼杀势头。
[00:34:54.210] Not to say that like flakiness is great in like a longer friendship, but I do think in older friendships, maybe it's just something that you've learned to accept from someone.
[00:34:54.210] 并不是说在一段较长的友谊中，这种反复无常的行为是件好事，但我认为在较老的友谊中，也许你已经学会接受对方的这种行为了。
[00:35:05.290] Not to say any names, but we do have a friend who tends to be a little flakier, but they've worked on it.
[00:35:05.290] 我不想点名，但我们确实有个朋友比较不靠谱，不过他们已经努力改正了。
[00:35:14.950] And, you know, that's like all we can ask.
[00:35:14.950] 你知道，这几乎就是我们所能要求的全部了。
[00:35:16.750] And we're like, okay, if they do, if they are a little late or like a little flaky, we just know like, ah, that's just how they are.
[00:35:16.750] 我们就会想，好吧，如果他们真的迟到了或者有点不靠谱，我们就知道，啊，他们就是这样的人。
[00:35:25.430] I guess this is a little bit more of a yellow flag, but one yellow flag that I've seen is maybe like lack of effort in conversations or hangouts.
[00:35:25.430] 我觉得这更像是一个警示信号，但我见过的一个警示信号可能是在谈话或聚会中缺乏诚意。
[00:35:35.710] So sometimes I think that manifests in like a lot of awkward silence or something when you're hanging out with someone.
[00:35:35.710] 所以有时候我觉得这会表现为和某人相处时出现很多尴尬的沉默之类的。
[00:35:41.650] And then other times it manifests in like you feel like you're always the one setting things up, being like, oh, let's hang out and having like an idea on what to do.
[00:35:41.650] 而有时候，这种感觉会表现为你总是感觉自己在安排事情，比如，哦，我们出去玩吧，而且你好像已经有了要做的事情的想法。
[00:35:50.050] And I feel like that can get old fairly fast.
[00:35:50.050] 我觉得这种做法很快就会让人厌倦。
[00:35:53.490] And actually, I think this is one yellow flag that is very easy to fix.
[00:35:53.490] 实际上，我认为这是一个很容易解决的警示信号。
[00:35:59.150] As soon as you communicate something like this, if your friend is receptive to that, then it's something that can easily change.
[00:35:59.150] 一旦你这样跟朋友沟通，如果你的朋友能够接受，那么事情就很容易改变。
[00:36:07.610] But it is a yellow flag that I have experienced.
[00:36:07.610] 但我确实经历过这种情况，这是一个危险信号。
[00:36:10.770] I guess you could also force the friend's hand.
[00:36:10.770] 我想你也可以逼迫朋友答应。
[00:36:13.630] You'd be like, hey, want to hang out on Tuesday?
[00:36:13.630] 你会说，嘿，周二想一起出去玩吗？
[00:36:15.590] And they're like, yeah, sure.
[00:36:15.590] 他们会说，是啊，当然。
[00:36:16.890] And then you'd be like, okay, you should pick somewhere to eat.
[00:36:16.890] 然后你就会想，好吧，你应该选个地方吃饭了。
[00:36:19.030] Yeah.
[00:36:19.030] 是的。
[00:36:20.250] Like you just force them to like make the decision.
[00:36:20.250] 就像你强迫他们做出决定一样。
[00:36:24.170] And I guess the other thing too is like it's not always a yellow flag because say your friend is always very invested in the hangout when you show up and hang, but they will never be the one to choose the method or like the location or restaurant.
[00:36:24.170] 我觉得还有一点，这并不总是危险信号，因为比如说，你的朋友每次和你一起出去玩都非常投入，但他们永远不会选择聚会的方式、地点或餐厅。
[00:36:37.230] To me, I think that's okay because at least when you're hanging out, it's fine.
[00:36:37.230] 我觉得没问题，因为至少和朋友们一起玩的时候是没问题的。
[00:36:40.690] So that just means that in this friendship, you're going to be the one picking stuff.
[00:36:40.690] 所以这意味着在这段友谊中，你会是挑选东西的那个人。
[00:36:44.550] And that's like, okay.
[00:36:44.550] 那就这样吧，好吧。
[00:36:45.630] But it's when it's like both things or maybe just like chronically one thing that it's just like, okay, like are we, is this a healthy friendship right now?
[00:36:45.630] 但当两者兼而有之，或者长期只表现出其中一种情况时，就会让人怀疑，好吧，我们现在的友谊是否健康？
[00:36:54.070] I think it's really about the quality time that you spend when you guys are with each other during hangouts.
[00:36:54.070] 我觉得关键在于你们聚会时在一起的时间质量。
[00:36:59.770] For example, I have a friend who is very, just not good at texting.
[00:36:59.770] 例如，我有个朋友非常不擅长发短信。
[00:37:05.230] It is like a long distance friendship, but she's just not good at texting or like checking in or whatever.
[00:37:05.230] 这就像一段异地友谊，但她不擅长发短信、问候之类的。
[00:37:11.070] But whenever we do hang out, it's like as if nothing has changed.
[00:37:11.070] 但每次我们聚在一起，感觉就像什么都没改变一样。
[00:37:15.610] Everything's still good.
[00:37:15.610] 一切都很好。
[00:37:16.790] And, you know, we're having so much fun.
[00:37:16.790] 你知道吗，我们玩得非常开心。
[00:37:18.990] At first, I was not used to it.
[00:37:18.990] 起初，我不习惯。
[00:37:20.990] And I was like, oh, like, I think that's a yellow flag or a red flag.
[00:37:20.990] 我当时就想，哦，我觉得那可能是黄旗或者红旗。
[00:37:24.490] Like, I don't think, I don't think this friendship is going to last.
[00:37:24.490] 我觉得，我觉得这段友谊不会长久。
[00:37:27.050] But then every time I am physically like hanging out, I'm like, oh my God, we're having so much fun together.
[00:37:27.050] 但每次我和大家一起出去玩的时候，我都会想，我的天哪，我们在一起玩得太开心了。
[00:37:32.650] Like we're having good conversations.
[00:37:32.650] 感觉我们聊得很投机。
[00:37:34.710] Of course, she's one of my closest friends.
[00:37:34.710] 当然，她是我最亲密的朋友之一。
[00:37:37.390] It always like flip-flossed.
[00:37:37.390] 它总是像用牙线一样翻转。
[00:37:38.530] But then I had to like learn that she's just not a good texter, but she is a good friend.
[00:37:38.530] 但后来我才知道，她只是不擅长发短信，但她是个好朋友。
[00:37:44.910] Mm-hmm.
[00:37:44.910] 嗯。
[00:37:45.790] Okay, I also have a yellow flag, but this is just completely subjective.
[00:37:45.790] 好吧，我也有一个黄旗，但这完全是主观感受。
[00:37:50.070] Sometimes their vibe just doesn't match yours.
[00:37:50.070] 有时候，他们的气质和你的气质就是不搭。
[00:37:53.250] So sometimes I think you just have to accept it that maybe you two don't vibe as well as you had hoped.
[00:37:53.250] 所以有时候我觉得你必须接受这样一个事实：你们两个可能不像你希望的那样合拍。
[00:38:01.050] And maybe that just means they can't be like a really good friend, but they could still be a friend, an acquaintance.
[00:38:01.050] 也许这意味着他们无法成为真正的好朋友，但他们仍然可以成为朋友或熟人。
[00:38:08.910] Mm-hmm.
[00:38:08.910] 嗯。
[00:38:09.990] I think a red flag is also when there's certain friends that only contact you when they need something.
[00:38:09.990] 我认为另一个危险信号是，有些朋友只有在需要你帮忙的时候才会联系你。
[00:38:16.650] Ooh, yeah.
[00:38:16.650] 哦，是的。
[00:38:17.270] I think for me, that's like a very big red flag.
[00:38:17.270] 我觉得这对我来说是一个非常大的危险信号。
[00:38:20.790] Mm-hmm.
[00:38:20.790] 嗯。
[00:38:21.310] Because I think I personally get hurt when that happens.
[00:38:21.310] 因为我觉得当这种情况发生时，我个人会受到伤害。
[00:38:25.090] Yeah, like it feels very transactional.
[00:38:25.090] 是啊，感觉很像交易。
[00:38:28.190] Oh, yeah.
[00:38:28.190] 哦，是的。
[00:38:28.970] I think that's a good word.
[00:38:28.970] 我觉得这个词用得不错。
[00:38:30.470] Transactional friendship.
[00:38:30.470] 交易型友谊。
[00:38:31.310] I think maybe another one is if they're always bringing the mood down.
[00:38:31.310] 我觉得还有一种可能是他们总是破坏气氛。
[00:38:37.710] Mm-hmm.
[00:38:37.710] 嗯。
[00:38:38.350] Because I think someone can complain but make it fun.
[00:38:38.350] 因为我觉得抱怨也可以很有趣。
[00:38:42.130] Yeah.
[00:38:42.130] 是的。
[00:38:42.510] But if someone's like kind of just like shitting on everything and just really bringing the mood down,
[00:38:42.510] 但如果有人总是扫兴，把气氛搞得很不愉快，
[00:38:48.890] I think that can be kind of a yellow to red flag.
[00:38:48.890] 我认为这可能是一个从黄灯到红灯的信号。
[00:38:52.130] Especially if it's like maybe you're talking about something you like,
[00:38:52.130] 尤其是当你谈论的是你喜欢的东西时，
[00:38:54.890] their responses are just shitting on it.
[00:38:54.890] 他们的回应简直是在贬低它。
[00:38:56.830] Whether it's like outwardly or subtly, I think that like kind of kills the vibe.
[00:38:56.830] 无论是公开的还是隐晦的，我觉得那样都会破坏气氛。
[00:39:01.990] Oh, for sure.
[00:39:01.990] 哦，当然。
[00:39:03.130] Or if they show like an interested vibe.
[00:39:03.130] 或者如果他们表现出感兴趣的样子。
[00:39:05.910] Mm-hmm.
[00:39:05.910] 嗯。
[00:39:06.790] I think actually, okay.
[00:39:06.790] 我觉得，好吧。
[00:39:09.010] I don't know if this is like a universal one or maybe this is just a me thing.
[00:39:09.010] 我不知道这是否是普遍现象，还是只是我个人的经历。
[00:39:12.490] I think a yellow flag for me, and this is definitely more so for like new friendships,
[00:39:12.490] 我觉得这应该算是个警示信号，而且这种情况尤其适用于建立新的友谊。
[00:39:18.050] but a yellow flag is like when their lifestyle just seems like really, really crazily different from mine.
[00:39:18.050] 但黄旗警告就像是他们的生活方式看起来和我的生活方式截然不同，真的非常非常疯狂。
[00:39:24.990] More so if they're friends with people that I feel like are very bad vibes.
[00:39:24.990] 尤其是当他们的朋友是我觉得会带来很不好感觉的人时，更是如此。
[00:39:30.490] Mm-hmm.
[00:39:30.490] 嗯。
[00:39:31.150] I think that is kind of a yellow flag for me.
[00:39:31.150] 我觉得这对我来说有点不祥之兆。
[00:39:33.510] Which is kind of shitty because in one sense, the friendship is just between you and this other person anyways.
[00:39:33.510] 这其实挺糟糕的，因为从某种意义上说，这段友谊本来就只存在于你和另一个人之间。
[00:39:39.550] So you almost should be isolating that from their like friends.
[00:39:39.550] 所以你几乎应该将他们与类似的朋友隔离开来。
[00:39:44.210] But I don't know.
[00:39:44.210] 但我不知道。
[00:39:45.190] Something about like seeing people's friends,
[00:39:45.190] 感觉就像见到别人的朋友一样，
[00:39:47.190] and if I feel like I'm getting really bad vibes from their friends,
[00:39:47.190] 如果我感觉他们的朋友对我的态度非常不好，
[00:39:51.350] it makes me kind of see people in a different light.
[00:39:51.350] 这让我对人有了不同的认识。
[00:39:54.030] I don't know if that's kind of shitty.
[00:39:54.030] 我不知道这算不算很糟糕。
[00:39:55.790] No, I think that's fair because isn't there that saying that like you're the average of all the people you hang out with?
[00:39:55.790] 不，我觉得这很公平，因为不是有句话说，你就是你身边所有人的平均值吗？
[00:40:01.750] Mm-hmm.
[00:40:01.750] 嗯。
[00:40:02.010] So if you know this one person has kind of a bad crowd that they're hanging out with,
[00:40:02.010] 所以，如果你知道这个人身边混迹着一群不太好的朋友，
[00:40:07.090] it probably does speak a bit to some traits that they might have.
[00:40:07.090] 这或许能反映出他们身上的一些特质。
[00:40:11.090] They might not be exactly like their friends, but they're friends for a reason.
[00:40:11.090] 他们或许和朋友不完全一样，但他们之所以成为朋友是有原因的。
[00:40:16.350] There has to be something common, right?
[00:40:16.350] 肯定有什么共同点，对吧？
[00:40:18.670] No, I don't think it's just a you thing.
[00:40:18.670] 不，我不认为这只是你个人的问题。
[00:40:21.330] I think it's more common than you think.
[00:40:21.330] 我认为这种情况比你想象的要普遍得多。
[00:40:24.910] Yeah, because I think someone could totally be very different from you,
[00:40:24.910] 是的，因为我觉得别人可能和你完全不一样。
[00:40:28.250] but in like a very positive way, right?
[00:40:28.250] 但这是件非常积极的事情，对吧？
[00:40:30.370] You're like, oh my god, I'm learning so much from you.
[00:40:30.370] 你会想，我的天哪，我从你身上学到了好多东西。
[00:40:32.830] Versus like, oh, like you're so different, but it's like not in a positive way.
[00:40:32.830] 而不是像，哦，你和我很不一样，但这种不一样并不是好事。
[00:40:37.710] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:40:37.710] 对，对，没错。
[00:40:39.930] I think another probably just a bad flag.
[00:40:39.930] 我觉得另一个可能只是个错误的标记。
[00:40:44.330] I don't know if it's yellow or red.
[00:40:44.330] 我不知道它是黄色还是红色。
[00:40:45.910] I think this is kind of in line with the boundaries thing,
[00:40:45.910] 我觉得这跟划定界限这件事有点关系。
[00:40:49.250] but like if they're really disrespectful to your space,
[00:40:49.250] 但如果他们真的非常不尊重你的空间，
[00:40:54.030] so anything from like your things to, you know, your home, your car.
[00:40:54.030] 所以任何东西，从你的物品到你的家、你的车等等。
[00:40:59.670] I'm just imagining if someone were to like be invited over to your home
[00:40:59.670] 我只是在想象，如果有人被邀请到你家来会是什么情景。
[00:41:03.990] and they just trashed it.
[00:41:03.990] 他们直接把它扔掉了。
[00:41:05.950] Yeah.
[00:41:05.950] 是的。
[00:41:06.270] You gave them a ride and they just like left a mess behind.
[00:41:06.270] 你载了他们一程，结果他们留下了一堆烂摊子。
[00:41:09.490] I think that's pretty annoying.
[00:41:09.490] 我觉得这很烦人。
[00:41:11.830] Not too great.
[00:41:11.830] 不太好。
[00:41:13.750] I once had this experience where I was just starting to become friends with someone.
[00:41:13.750] 我曾经有过这样的经历，当时我刚开始和某人成为朋友。
[00:41:19.170] I was like, oh, this person is pretty cool.
[00:41:19.170] 我当时就想，哦，这个人挺酷的。
[00:41:21.050] And then once she asked me for like a ride home,
[00:41:21.050] 然后有一次她问我能不能送她回家，
[00:41:24.150] so I was driving her back and then she put her feet on my dash.
[00:41:24.150] 我当时正开车送她回去，然后她把脚放在了我的仪表盘上。
[00:41:28.530] Oh.
[00:41:28.530] 哦。
[00:41:29.290] And like she was wearing like flip flops at the time, right?
[00:41:29.290] 当时她好像穿着人字拖，对吧？
[00:41:32.310] So it was like her bare feet.
[00:41:32.310] 就像她光着脚一样。
[00:41:33.650] And I was like, that's fucking crazy.
[00:41:33.650] 我当时就想，这太疯狂了。
[00:41:36.250] Like I don't think we can be friends anymore.
[00:41:36.250] 我觉得我们可能再也不能做朋友了。
[00:41:40.050] I did not want to see your feet up there.
[00:41:40.050] 我不想看到你的脚在那里。
[00:41:43.050] I didn't even say anything.
[00:41:43.050] 我一句话也没说。
[00:41:44.850] Or actually, I think I did, but it was kind of passive aggressive.
[00:41:44.850] 或者说，其实我觉得我的确这么做了，但方式有点阴阳怪气。
[00:41:47.670] I was like, oh, sorry.
[00:41:47.670] 我当时就想，哦，对不起。
[00:41:48.810] I like to keep my car like a little clean.
[00:41:48.810] 我喜欢保持我的车稍微干净一些。
[00:41:51.110] Do you mind not doing that or something?
[00:41:51.110] 你介意不做这件事吗？
[00:41:53.470] But then the whole time after, every time I saw her,
[00:41:53.470] 但之后的那段时间，每次我见到她，
[00:41:56.250] that was all I could think about.
[00:41:56.250] 我当时满脑子都是这件事。
[00:41:57.370] I was like, dude, you put your fucking feet on my dash.
[00:41:57.370] 我当时就想，老兄，你竟然把脚放在我的仪表盘上！
[00:42:01.810] That's also dangerous.
[00:42:01.810] 那也很危险。
[00:42:03.570] It is.
[00:42:03.570] 这是。
[00:42:04.790] It is.
[00:42:04.790] 这是。
[00:42:06.990] That's all funny though.
[00:42:06.990] 不过这一切都挺滑稽的。
[00:42:09.350] I feel like a lot of friendship is just kind of based on what kind of person they are.
[00:42:09.350] 我觉得很多友谊都取决于彼此的性格。
[00:42:14.550] Personally for me, it's like how I decide whether I want to become friends with them
[00:42:14.550] 对我个人而言，这就像我决定是否要和他们成为朋友一样。
[00:42:19.190] is I think like first just kind of, I guess judging, but not judging what kind of person
[00:42:19.190] 我觉得首先有点像是在评判，但不是评判什么样的人。
[00:42:25.570] they are.
[00:42:25.570] 没错。
[00:42:26.490] Are they the type of person that I want in my life?
[00:42:26.490] 他们是我想要留在我生命中的那种人吗？
[00:42:29.550] Or am I just trying to make friends just to make friends?
[00:42:29.550] 或者我只是为了交朋友而交朋友？
[00:42:32.150] Because I don't know.
[00:42:32.150] 因为我不知道。
[00:42:33.570] I think at this point in my life or at my age, I don't want to spend all the time and effort
[00:42:33.570] 我觉得到了我这个年纪，或者说人生这个阶段，我不想再把所有的时间和精力都花在这件事上了。
[00:42:39.050] into a friendship that I know is just not going to work out.
[00:42:39.050] 我明知这段友谊不会有结果，却还是开始了。
[00:42:44.750] That's fair.
[00:42:44.750] 这很合理。
[00:42:45.450] Especially because our time is becoming more and more limited as we get older.
[00:42:45.450] 尤其是随着年龄增长，我们的时间变得越来越有限。
[00:42:51.310] We have more responsibilities and obligations.
[00:42:51.310] 我们肩负着更多责任和义务。
[00:42:54.570] It's not really about making as many friends as you can anymore.
[00:42:54.570] 现在重要的已经不是尽可能多地结交朋友了。
[00:42:58.830] It's more about making good and meaningful friendships, right?
[00:42:58.830] 更重要的是建立美好而有意义的友谊，对吗？
[00:43:03.350] I think it truly is quality over quantity, which is interesting because that kind of goes
[00:43:03.350] 我认为确实是质量重于数量，这很有意思，因为这有点像……
[00:43:08.570] to show at certain ages in our lives, it kind of is quantity over quality a little bit.
[00:43:08.570] 这表明，在我们人生的某些阶段，数量似乎比质量更重要。
[00:43:13.970] Dude, definitely.
[00:43:13.970] 兄弟，绝对的。
[00:43:15.490] Yeah.
[00:43:15.490] 是的。
[00:43:16.250] But it's so weird to think how the mindset changed, right?
[00:43:16.250] 但想到人们的思维方式发生了如此巨大的变化，真是令人感到不可思议，对吧？
[00:43:18.830] If you think about it, elementary school, junior high, high school, that's all like quantity
[00:43:18.830] 仔细想想，小学、初中、高中，这些都跟数量有关。
[00:43:24.330] over quality, right?
[00:43:24.330] 质量比质量更重要，对吧？
[00:43:25.290] Because you want to be like the popular kid or whatever.
[00:43:25.290] 因为你想成为受欢迎的孩子之类的。
[00:43:28.570] Or that's always made to be seen as like the goal through media, right?
[00:43:28.570] 或者说，媒体总是把这描绘成目标，对吧？
[00:43:34.030] It's like, oh, like that person has so many friends or whatever.
[00:43:34.030] 就好像，哦，那个人有很多朋友什么的。
[00:43:36.630] But honestly, if you just had a couple of really good friends going through school, I feel like
[00:43:36.630] 但说实话，如果你在上学期间只有几个非常要好的朋友，我觉得
[00:43:43.670] that is very valuable.
[00:43:43.670] 那非常有价值。
[00:43:46.050] And I think the running joke back in like college or whatever is the same people would hang out and
[00:43:46.050] 我觉得以前在大学之类的场合，经常会听到这样的说法：总是那几个人聚在一起。
[00:43:51.930] then we'd be like, oh, no new friends and like roast ourselves.
[00:43:51.930] 然后我们就会想，哦，没有新朋友，然后互相嘲讽。
[00:43:54.990] But I feel like those are the same friends we still hang out with to this day.
[00:43:54.990] 但我感觉这些朋友和我们至今仍然保持着联系。
[00:43:59.490] And that is so meaningful.
[00:43:59.490] 这意义非凡。
[00:44:02.710] I think that's rare and definitely something not to like take for granted.
[00:44:02.710] 我认为这很罕见，绝对不应该被视为理所当然。
[00:44:06.710] Yeah.
[00:44:06.710] 是的。
[00:44:07.190] So maybe no new friends was not too bad.
[00:44:07.190] 所以，也许没有新朋友也并非那么糟糕。
[00:44:09.750] Do you guys feel like you've made new friends recently?
[00:44:09.750] 你们觉得最近交到新朋友了吗？
[00:44:19.150] Dude, I was actually thinking about this literally yesterday on my drive back from the grocery
[00:44:19.150] 老兄，我昨天开车从超市回来的时候还在想这事儿呢。
[00:44:24.750] store.
[00:44:24.750] 店铺。
[00:44:25.350] I was like, have I been making new friends lately?
[00:44:25.350] 我当时想，我最近是不是交了新朋友？
[00:44:28.590] To be honest, I don't think I've been making too many like new friends in like my personal
[00:44:28.590] 说实话，我觉得我在个人生活中并没有结交太多新朋友。
[00:44:36.050] social life, but I have been making some new friends at work.
[00:44:36.050] 社交生活方面，我在工作中结交了一些新朋友。
[00:44:40.070] And I was like, you know what?
[00:44:40.070] 我当时就想，你知道吗？
[00:44:41.950] That is good enough.
[00:44:41.950] 这样就足够好了。
[00:44:44.090] I don't need to make too many new friends in my personal social life.
[00:44:44.090] 在个人社交生活中，我不需要结交太多新朋友。
[00:44:48.910] I think that's already very like fulfilled, but it's kind of also cool to grow friendships
[00:44:48.910] 我觉得这方面已经基本实现了，不过发展友谊也挺不错的。
[00:44:54.670] in other aspects of life.
[00:44:54.670] 在生活的其他方面。
[00:44:56.830] Yeah.
[00:44:56.830] 是的。
[00:44:57.330] I feel like if I think about the last, I guess, six years now since college graduation, I can
[00:44:57.330] 我觉得如果我回想一下过去六年，也就是大学毕业后的这六年，我就可以……
[00:45:03.330] just like sit down and name for you all the new friends that I've made since college,
[00:45:03.330] 就像坐下来，把我大学毕业后结交的所有新朋友都一一列举出来一样，
[00:45:08.110] which means the list is not very long.
[00:45:08.110] 这意味着名单并不长。
[00:45:10.410] Right.
[00:45:10.410] 正确的。
[00:45:10.690] But I feel like all of those friends that I've made are still good friends now.
[00:45:10.690] 但我感觉我结交的那些朋友现在仍然都是好朋友。
[00:45:14.930] Yeah.
[00:45:14.930] 是的。
[00:45:15.190] Maybe not too bad of a trade off.
[00:45:15.190] 或许这笔交易还算不错。
[00:45:17.350] Although the drop in pace of like friend making is slightly concerning.
[00:45:17.350] 虽然喜欢结交朋友的速度下降有点令人担忧。
[00:45:23.330] That's true.
[00:45:23.330] 这是真的。
[00:45:24.210] I think mine like kind of stopped after high school.
[00:45:24.210] 我觉得我的性生活好像在高中毕业后就停止了。
[00:45:28.450] I think I feel similarly.
[00:45:28.450] 我也有同感。
[00:45:30.450] It definitely slowed down a lot post high school.
[00:45:30.450] 高中毕业后，我的节奏明显慢了很多。
[00:45:32.530] Yeah.
[00:45:32.530] 是的。
[00:45:33.850] I think when we are in school, we're kind of forced to be with each other.
[00:45:33.850] 我觉得我们在学校的时候，某种程度上是被迫待在一起的。
[00:45:37.670] So it's a lot easier to get to know one another and to pick and choose your people.
[00:45:37.670] 所以彼此了解起来容易得多，选择自己喜欢的人也更容易。
[00:45:43.190] But when you're at work and everyone's doing their own thing, it's a lot harder.
[00:45:43.190] 但是，当你在工作中，每个人都在做自己的事情时，这就困难得多。
[00:45:47.690] Yeah, definitely.
[00:45:47.690] 是的，当然。
[00:45:49.130] Which is so funny because when I was young, sometimes we would eat dinner with my dad's
[00:45:49.130] 这真有趣，因为我小时候，有时候我们会和爸爸一起吃晚饭。
[00:45:53.910] work friends and their families.
[00:45:53.910] 同事朋友及其家人。
[00:45:56.550] And I remember thinking like, dude, what's a work friend?
[00:45:56.550] 我当时就想，老兄，什么是工作朋友？
[00:46:00.110] You're not really friends.
[00:46:00.110] 你们其实不是朋友。
[00:46:02.010] You're just like colleagues, you know?
[00:46:02.010] 你们就像同事一样，你知道吗？
[00:46:03.670] And now that I'm older, I get it.
[00:46:03.670] 现在我年纪大了，我明白了。
[00:46:05.430] I'm like, yeah, work friends are real.
[00:46:05.430] 我心想，是啊，工作中的朋友是真实存在的。
[00:46:07.270] Oh my God.
[00:46:07.270] 我的天啊。
[00:46:08.130] Actually, that's a good point.
[00:46:08.130] 确实，你说得很有道理。
[00:46:09.390] I totally questioned that before too.
[00:46:09.390] 我之前也对此抱有疑问。
[00:46:11.630] I maybe questioned how deep a work connection could be because there's always this level
[00:46:11.630] 我或许会质疑工作关系究竟能有多深，因为总会存在某种程度的隔阂。
[00:46:18.150] of professionalism you have to uphold.
[00:46:18.150] 你必须秉持的专业精神。
[00:46:20.310] But yeah, now that I'm, you know, a person in work, I'm like, oh yeah, like these connections
[00:46:20.310] 但是，现在我正式步入职场了，我就觉得，哦，这些关系真的很重要。
[00:46:27.230] can actually be really meaningful and deep.
[00:46:27.230] 实际上可以非常有意义，也很深刻。
[00:46:30.310] And I think your work friends are the only ones that can truly understand your struggles
[00:46:30.310] 我认为只有你的工作朋友才能真正理解你的困境。
[00:46:35.750] at work.
[00:46:35.750] 在上班。
[00:46:36.650] True.
[00:46:36.650] 真的。
[00:46:37.450] You can tell your best friend all about work and they might not understand everything,
[00:46:37.450] 你可以把工作上的一切都告诉最好的朋友，但他们也未必能完全理解。
[00:46:42.470] but your work friend probably will.
[00:46:42.470] 但你的同事朋友很可能会。
[00:46:44.470] It's like that meme where it's me and my best friend have been friends for like 10
[00:46:44.470] 就像那个梗图一样，我和我最好的朋友已经认识10年了。
[00:46:49.110] plus years, but I don't even know what they do.
[00:46:49.110] 这么多年过去了，我甚至都不知道他们是做什么的。
[00:46:53.650] But honestly, that's true.
[00:46:53.650] 但说实话，确实如此。
[00:46:55.250] Like I kind of don't know what my best friends do.
[00:46:55.250] 我好像不太了解我最好的朋友们都在做什么。
[00:46:59.010] I know there's nothing like one of those conversations with your work friend after a very traumatic
[00:46:59.010] 我知道，在经历了一场非常痛苦的事情之后，没有什么比和你的工作朋友进行那种对话更让人感到温暖的了。
[00:47:04.590] week where you just look at each other and you're like, holy shit, like what happened
[00:47:04.590] 整整一周，你们俩面面相觑，然后都惊呆了，心想：我的天，到底发生了什么？
[00:47:07.870] this week?
[00:47:07.870] 本星期？
[00:47:09.670] That's a different type of relationship.
[00:47:09.670] 那是一种不同的关系。
[00:47:11.470] Yeah.
[00:47:11.470] 是的。
[00:47:13.050] Well, I think we had a really good talk about what friendship kind of is to us and how we
[00:47:13.050] 嗯，我觉得我们好好聊了聊友谊对我们来说意味着什么，以及我们如何看待友谊。
[00:47:19.510] view good or bad flags within a friendship and how we kind of recognize that within ourselves
[00:47:19.510] 如何在友谊中识别好坏信号，以及我们如何在内心深处识别这些信号。
[00:47:26.390] as well.
[00:47:26.390] 也一样。
[00:47:27.130] And I think ultimately what we agreed upon a lot is that good friends are very accepting
[00:47:27.130] 我觉得我们最终达成共识的一点是，好朋友都是非常包容的。
[00:47:33.790] of each other and kind of learn to like adapt with each other's personalities.
[00:47:33.790] 互相了解，并逐渐学会适应彼此的性格。
[00:47:38.810] So thank you so much, Helen, for joining us.
