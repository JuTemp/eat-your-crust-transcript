[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo, I'm Crystal, I'm Jonathan Welcome back, Jonathan
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal，我是Jonathan。欢迎回来，Jonathan。
[00:00:19.000]  Last time you were on the podcast it was a little while ago's episode 179 and we talked
[00:00:19.000] 你上次做客播客节目还是不久前的第179期，我们聊了聊。
[00:00:25.160]  about being in law school which was a good episode so be sure to check that out if
[00:00:25.160] 这集讲的是法学院生活，挺不错的，所以如果感兴趣的话一定要去看看。
[00:00:29.960]  anyone is interested in law school. We brought Jonathan on today to talk about mixing
[00:00:29.960] 任何人都对法学院感兴趣。我们今天请来了乔纳森来谈谈混合法。
[00:00:36.000]  friend groups but before that we have a Gen Z phrase to kind of talk about and I think
[00:00:36.000] 朋友圈，但在此之前，我们先来谈谈Z世代的一个流行语，我认为
[00:00:41.360]  this one has been popping up a decent amount so it's like kind of popular especially
[00:00:41.360] 这个帖子出现的频率相当高，所以它还挺受欢迎的，尤其如此。
[00:00:45.960]  on TikTok now, the phrase is do it for the plot. The definition for this is basically
[00:00:45.960] 现在TikTok上流行一句“为了剧情而做”。这句话的定义基本上是：
[00:00:52.920]  I would describe it as Gen Z's version of Yolo or just like fuck it, do it essentially
[00:00:52.920] 我会把它描述为Z世代版的“YOLO”（You Only Live Once，你只活一次），或者干脆就是“管他呢，干就干”。
[00:00:59.680]  you're telling someone to like do it for the plot of your life right so like oh fuck
[00:00:59.680] 你这是在告诉别人为了你的人生剧情而去做这件事，对吧，所以，哦，该死
[00:01:04.320]  it just do it. I think it's also an extension of do it for the vine or do it for the
[00:01:04.320] 就这么做吧。我觉得它也是“为了Vine而做”或“为了……”的延伸。
[00:01:10.160]  snap. I remember back then there was a really big deal to have funny Snapchat stories
[00:01:10.160] 我记得那时候，在 Snapchat 上发布有趣的故事可是件大事。
[00:01:14.480]  essentially but now it's gone beyond the social media platforms and it's like actually
[00:01:14.480] 本质上是这样，但现在它已经超越了社交媒体平台，而且实际上……
[00:01:20.040]  about our lives. Yeah dude I'm not gonna lie, I thought I was young and hip and up to date
[00:01:20.040] 关于我们的生活。是啊，兄弟，我实话实说，我以前觉得自己年轻、时髦、跟得上时代。
[00:01:25.480]  all of this but I literally have not heard this at all before it's crazy.
[00:01:25.480] 这一切都让我难以置信，我以前从未听说过，太不可思议了。
[00:01:32.700]  I think this one is like pretty Gen Z specific millennials don't really use this one.
[00:01:32.700] 我觉得这个功能比较偏向 Z 世代，千禧一代不太用。
[00:01:38.640]  Oh my god are we getting old? It's funny because a lot of the ones that I've actually seen
[00:01:38.640] 我的天哪，我们是不是老了？说起来挺搞笑的，因为我真正看过的很多电影都……
[00:01:44.500]  would do it for the plot in the beginning when I first discovered this phrase it was all
[00:01:44.500] 一开始，当我第一次发现这句话时，它完全是为了情节需要。
[00:01:48.920]  millennials on TikTok like oh my god Gen Z's playing is so interesting. They keep telling
[00:01:48.920] TikTok上的千禧一代纷纷表示，天哪，Z世代玩的游戏太有趣了。他们一直在说
[00:01:53.880]  me to do it for the plot and I kind of feel good about that. That's like and that's
[00:01:53.880] 我这么做是为了剧情需要，我感觉这样挺好。就是这样，就是这样。
[00:01:59.680]  like how I first learned about it but now I'm like seeing it more in Gen Z TikTok well
[00:01:59.680] 我最初就是通过TikTok了解到它的，但现在我更多地在Z世代的TikTok上看到它。
[00:02:05.440]  you know I'm mostly on millennial TikTok. I feel like I like this phrase specifically
[00:02:05.440] 你知道我主要在刷千禧一代的TikTok。我觉得我特别喜欢这句话。
[00:02:11.560]  too because it incites so much chaos. It's like okay there's a reasonable option that
[00:02:11.560] 也因为它会引发太多的混乱。这就好比，好吧，其实有一个合理的选择……
[00:02:16.920]  I would take but there's an option that would further the plot and like complicate things
[00:02:16.920] 我本来想选这个选项，但是还有一个选项会推动剧情发展，让事情变得更复杂。
[00:02:21.240]  and make things interesting so why don't you do that one? It's like it's a really easy
[00:02:21.240] 这样会让事情变得更有趣，所以你为什么不试试呢？这简直太容易了。
[00:02:25.500]  one to like go to your friends into doing something funny. Yeah just spice things up a bit.
[00:02:25.500] 比如，你可以和朋友们一起做些有趣的事。对，就是给生活增添一些乐趣。
[00:02:30.520]  Yeah yeah I think you're right it's usually used when someone's like oh my god try
[00:02:30.520] 对对，我觉得你说得对，通常用来形容“我的天哪，试试看”之类的。
[00:02:36.080]  do this like questional thing everyone's like do it for the plot. Okay so when's the last
[00:02:36.080] 大家就像在问问题一样，都说这是为了剧情需要。好吧，那么最后一个是什么时候？
[00:02:42.640]  time you guys did something for the plot? Oh last time I did something for the plot.
[00:02:42.640] 你们上次为剧情做贡献是什么时候？哦，上次我为剧情做贡献还是在上一次。
[00:02:47.320]  It's a very good question. Let me check my calendar. This is really boring if I'm going
[00:02:47.320] 这是个很好的问题。让我看看我的日程安排。如果我要去的话，这真的太无聊了。
[00:02:54.520]  to think of something I did for the plot it was truly just taking this career I'm doing
[00:02:54.520] 想想我为剧情所做的一切，其实就是从事我现在这份职业。
[00:02:59.200]  now because literally going into it I was like I don't even know what I'm doing but
[00:02:59.200] 现在，因为说实话，一开始我根本不知道我在做什么，但是
[00:03:03.920]  fuck it let's do it for the plot I just kept going with the flow. I like that that's
[00:03:03.920] 管他呢，就按剧情来吧，我就顺其自然了。我喜欢这样。
[00:03:09.560]  a big one. Yeah but it's such a boring plot. Actually I think I kind of have one so the
[00:03:09.560] 一个大故事。是啊，但是剧情太无聊了。其实我觉得我好像也有一个，所以……
[00:03:17.840]  person that I'm dating right now we were like kind of set up. I had the option when
[00:03:17.840] 我现在交往的这个人，我们算是相亲吧。当时我有选择的权利。
[00:03:23.400]  the setup was getting brought up I could have been like oh no like I'm fine but I was
[00:03:23.400] 事情进展到这个阶段，我本来可以装作没事的样子，但我却……
[00:03:28.240]  kind of like alright whatever fuck it. Yeah for the plot. Yeah look at your plot now.
[00:03:28.240] 有点像“好吧，随便吧，管它呢”。是啊，为了剧情。是啊，看看你现在的剧情。
[00:03:36.640]  I love these. I've like mine is so much of a smaller plot event compared to you guys
[00:03:36.640] 我喜欢这些。不过，和你们的相比，我的剧情规模要小得多。
[00:03:42.000]  but last week it was James's birthday so we went out for a really nice dinner and then
[00:03:42.000] 但上周是詹姆斯的生日，所以我们出去吃了一顿非常棒的晚餐，然后
[00:03:46.840]  we came back and we were like okay let's have a really relaxing hotel night in keep it
[00:03:46.840] 我们回来后就想，好吧，那就好好放松一下，在酒店里待一晚吧。
[00:03:51.880]  super special and then we fell asleep and then we woke up and then James was like okay
[00:03:51.880] 非常特别，然后我们就睡着了，然后我们醒了，然后詹姆斯就说，好吧
[00:03:57.680]  let's go clubbing because some of our friends had gotten a table so then we literally got
[00:03:57.680] 咱们去夜店玩吧，因为我们几个朋友订了桌，所以我们就真的去了。
[00:04:02.800]  up from bed I redid my hair and like put on all our clothes and then we went out clubbing
[00:04:02.800] 我起床后重新梳了头发，穿上我们所有的衣服，然后我们就去夜店玩了。
[00:04:07.760]  at like midnight. That is crazy. It was I was like I'm never napped and then like gone
[00:04:07.760] 大概半夜吧。太疯狂了。我当时想，我从来不睡午觉，然后就突然睡着了。
[00:04:13.240]  out before but that let's us getting sick so maybe the plot is not always positive.
[00:04:13.240] 以前也发生过，但这让我们生病了，所以也许剧情并不总是积极的。
[00:04:21.000]  The plot reindeer in. Yeah. Okay also the craziest part about that is James waking up and
[00:04:21.000] 剧情驯鹿登场了。是的。好吧，还有，最疯狂的部分是詹姆斯醒来……
[00:04:27.480]  being like let's go clubbing. Dude that's what I'm saying. I was like who is this man?
[00:04:27.480] 就好像在说“咱们去夜店玩吧”。哥们儿，我就是这个意思。我当时就想，这人是谁啊？
[00:04:32.440]  This is James at 28. 20. Unhinged. That kind of reminds me I think the last time
[00:04:32.440] 这是28岁的詹姆斯。20岁，精神错乱。这让我想起了上次……
[00:04:40.760]  I did something for the plot was last minute I was like you know what fuck it I'll go to
[00:04:40.760] 我为剧情做了点什么，那是最后一刻才决定的，当时我就想，算了，管他呢，我去吧。
[00:04:45.880]  EDC for like a day. This is like a day or two after my graduation. It was fun in the
[00:04:45.880] 大概过了一天，我参加了EDC（电子竞技俱乐部）。这大概是我毕业后的一两天。玩得很开心。
[00:04:51.760]  moment but I remember before I went everyone's like posting stories you know a lot of people
[00:04:51.760] 那一刻，但我记得在我走之前，每个人都在发故事，你知道，很多人都在发。
[00:04:56.280]  were younger so they're posting the sunrise they have like crying face emojis they're
[00:04:56.280] 他们年纪还小，所以会发日出的照片，还会配上哭泣的表情符号。
[00:05:00.040]  like can't believe it's over. The whole day I was like smack talking I was like dude that
[00:05:00.040] 简直不敢相信就这么结束了。我一整天都在嘲讽他们，我说，兄弟，那……
[00:05:04.080]  is so degenerate. I can't believe people are sad that the sun is rising couldn't be us
[00:05:04.080] 真是太堕落了。我简直不敢相信有人会因为太阳升起而感到悲伤，这难道不是我们自己的事吗？
[00:05:10.920]  it ended up being us. We're just sitting on the stands like cool off before leaving and
[00:05:10.920] 最后是我们。我们就像在离开前一样，坐在看台上冷静一下。
[00:05:14.440]  the sun starts coming up and everyone starts cheering and I was like oh my gosh guys we need
[00:05:14.440] 太阳开始升起，大家开始欢呼，我当时就想，我的天哪，伙计们，我们需要
[00:05:18.500]  to get the fuck out of here dude. I was literally so tired. What was that phrase? It's like
[00:05:18.500] 赶紧滚出这儿去，老兄。我当时真的太累了。那句话怎么说来着？就像……
[00:05:24.360]  you become what you hate or something. Exactly. I became the villain of my own story.
[00:05:24.360] 你会变成你所憎恨的那种人。没错。我成了自己故事里的反派。
[00:05:29.880]  This city there listening to some fucking pots and pans with a throbbing headache going
[00:05:29.880] 这座城市里的人听着锅碗瓢盆的敲击声，头痛欲裂。
[00:05:35.880]  like damn dude I just need to get out of this desert right now. Like I'm not young anymore.
[00:05:35.880] 老兄，我得赶紧离开这片沙漠。我已经不再年轻了。
[00:05:41.480]  Actually. Dude EDC is such a like it is a fucking journey. Yeah and then it's like you aren't
[00:05:41.480] 真的。老兄，EDC 就像一场他妈的旅程。是啊，然后感觉就像你不在了。
[00:05:49.080]  even able to sleep well once you get back home. And you got to drive home like in a few
[00:05:49.080] 甚至回到家后也能睡个好觉。而且你还得像在几个地方一样开车回家。
[00:05:53.280]  hours. Yeah. Well plot events aside kind of want to bring us back to our topic today. So
[00:05:53.280] 几个小时。是的。好吧，先不说剧情，我们还是回到今天的主题吧。
[00:06:00.880]  today we really wanted to talk about mixing friend groups. I feel like there's a very specific
[00:06:00.880] 今天我们想重点谈谈朋友圈混杂的问题。我觉得这其中存在一个非常具体的问题。
[00:06:06.720]  art to mixing friend groups. I know some friends of mine do it super super well and fluidly where
[00:06:06.720] 将朋友群体融合在一起是一种艺术。我知道我的一些朋友在这方面做得非常好，而且非常自然流畅。
[00:06:13.040]  you don't even notice that there's multiple friend groups being mixed but it can be sort
[00:06:13.040] 你甚至不会注意到有好几个朋友群体混在一起，但这可能有点……
[00:06:17.600]  of a high pressure thing for some people it could be a hobby for others. So I'm definitely excited
[00:06:17.600] 对某些人来说，这可能是一件压力巨大的事情，但对另一些人来说，它可能只是一种爱好。所以我当然很兴奋。
[00:06:22.000]  kind of dive through the intricacies of mixing friend groups with you guys today. Let's kind
[00:06:22.000] 今天就和大家一起深入探讨一下如何巧妙地融合不同的朋友圈吧。
[00:06:26.800]  of start this off by how often do you mix friend groups in your hangouts and what situations are
[00:06:26.800] 首先，请问你们多久会和不同朋友群体聚会一次？以及在哪些情况下会这样做？
[00:06:33.440]  you most likely to consider mixing friend groups? Generally I feel like me and I guess most people
[00:06:33.440] 你最有可能考虑混搭朋友圈吗？一般来说，我觉得我和大多数人一样。
[00:06:41.760]  a lot of the friend group mixing comes in with like bigger events like maybe like birthdays,
[00:06:41.760] 很多朋友间的聚会都是在像生日这样的大型活动中发生的。
[00:06:47.040]  weddings. The awesome friend mixer. Exactly. Or like you go to like a festival or something.
[00:06:47.040] 婚礼。超棒的朋友聚会。没错。或者像参加音乐节之类的活动。
[00:06:55.920]  I think I'm probably similar to J.Soo. I don't usually host too many like mixed friend group events
[00:06:55.920] 我觉得我可能和J.Soo差不多。我平时不太会举办那种朋友混杂的聚会。
[00:07:03.680]  unless it's like something kind of bigger like a birthday party but otherwise I just attend
[00:07:03.680] 除非是像生日派对那样比较大型的活动，否则我只会参加。
[00:07:09.600]  friend mixing events. I think I totally agree with you guys where I don't mix friend groups that
[00:07:09.600] 朋友聚会活动。我完全同意你们的观点，我不会让不同的朋友群体混在一起。
[00:07:17.200]  often. I think especially smaller events I do not like mixing friend groups just because
[00:07:17.200] 经常。我觉得尤其是在小型活动中，我不喜欢随意混搭不同的朋友群体。
[00:07:23.760]  the less people there are in an event and the more intimate the setting is. I feel like there's
[00:07:23.760] 活动参与人数越少，氛围就越私密。我觉得这样更好。
[00:07:27.600]  more pressure for those people to get along versus in a bigger setting especially in like a party
[00:07:27.600] 与在更大的场合（例如聚会）相比，在这种小型场合，人们更容易感受到相处融洽的压力。
[00:07:33.040]  setting maybe more birthday party it's just so much more casual people can separate if they want to,
[00:07:33.040] 或许可以把生日派对办得更随意一些，因为这样大家可以随意分开。
[00:07:38.160]  people can vibe if they want to. So there's less of that like okay this group of six people need
[00:07:38.160] 人们可以自由地融入彼此的圈子。所以，那种“好吧，这六个人需要……”的情况就少了很多。
[00:07:43.680]  to be best friends by the end of the night kind of pressure. That's fair. What about like if you
[00:07:43.680] 那种要在晚上结束前成为好朋友的压力。这很合理。那如果你……
[00:07:48.960]  have one main friend group but then you want to invite someone who you're close to do do that often
[00:07:48.960] 你可能有一群主要的朋友，但你也经常想邀请一些关系亲近的人来参加活动。
[00:07:55.440]  or do you just think like fuck I'll just stick to the main friend group? I think I do that pretty
[00:07:55.440] 还是你会想“算了，我还是不跟主要朋友圈待着吧”？我觉得我挺像的。
[00:08:00.720]  often. I think a big part of mixing friend groups is also your confidence in yourself that the
[00:08:00.720] 经常。我认为，混杂朋友圈很大程度上也取决于你对自己的自信。
[00:08:07.280]  friends you make are all mostly similar to your personality even though I have like different groups
[00:08:07.280] 你交的朋友大多都和你的性格相似，即使我有不同的朋友群体。
[00:08:13.200]  of friends. They all generally have very compatible personalities so it's like not hard to bring one or
[00:08:13.200] 朋友们。他们性格通常都很合得来，所以带一个或几个朋友一起玩并不难。
[00:08:20.880]  two additional people and it's like if there's a main group of friends I'm like yo could I invite
[00:08:20.880] 再加两个人，就好像如果有个主要的朋友圈，我就会问他们：“嘿，我可以邀请他们吗？”
[00:08:25.280]  like I don't know like one of my friends from high school and stuff they're like that down.
[00:08:25.280] 比如我不知道，我高中时的一个朋友，他们就是这样。
[00:08:29.680]  Oh my god but on that topic what if you're being invited to an event and then you're like oh can
[00:08:29.680] 我的天哪，说到这个话题，如果你被邀请参加一个活动，然后你说，哦，可以吗？
[00:08:35.920]  I bring this one friend with me but then that one friend doesn't know anyone do you feel obligated
[00:08:35.920] 我带了一个朋友来，但这个朋友谁也不认识，你觉得你有义务陪她吗？
[00:08:42.960]  to stay with them the whole time? I think I would and it's not necessarily always like a negative
[00:08:42.960] 一直陪着他们？我想我会的，而且这不一定总是件坏事。
[00:08:49.120]  obligation of like oh I feel weighed down by the burden of having to carry this friend but it's more
[00:08:49.120] 感觉自己肩负着一种责任，就像要照顾这个朋友一样，但其实远不止如此。
[00:08:53.840]  of like I have a lot of social anxiety so then if I was a plus one I would probably like follow
[00:08:53.840] 比如，我社交焦虑很严重，所以如果我是陪同人员，我可能会跟着他们走。
[00:08:59.040]  whoever invited me around through the night see who their friends are and like kind of joining on
[00:08:59.040] 晚上邀请我出去玩的人，看看他们的朋友都是谁，然后就顺便加入他们。
[00:09:03.760]  those conversations so hopefully if I'm the one inviting someone I'm able to like keep up with
[00:09:03.760] 希望通过这些对话，如果是我邀请别人，我能跟上他们的节奏。
[00:09:10.160]  my personal expectation as well. That makes sense. I think it's also if I'm gonna invite someone
[00:09:10.160] 我个人也是这么想的。这很合理。我觉得这也跟我是否会邀请某人有关。
[00:09:15.520]  I think I've already made up my mind by then of I'm gonna be sticking with this person and making
[00:09:15.520] 我想到那时我已经下定决心要和这个人在一起了。
[00:09:20.800]  sure that they're getting along with everyone. I wouldn't invite someone and just like leave them
[00:09:20.800] 确保他们和每个人都相处融洽。我不会邀请某人，然后就离开。
[00:09:25.920]  but I think one thing that makes it easier too is I think a lot of our friends are like this they're
[00:09:25.920] 但我认为让这件事变得更容易的另一个原因是，我觉得我们很多朋友都是这样的，他们
[00:09:30.800]  very inclusive makes it easy to get along with them so like a lot of times if it's just like a big
[00:09:30.800] 非常包容的氛围让人很容易与他们相处，所以很多时候，如果只是像一个大家庭一样。
[00:09:37.200]  group gathering and you invite one or two additional people I find like by the end of the night they're
[00:09:37.200] 一群人聚会，你再邀请一两个人，我发现到了晚上结束的时候，他们……
[00:09:41.600]  like chopping it up with everyone else. I feel like it's easier to be a guest and bring some friends
[00:09:41.600] 就像和大家一起聊天一样。我觉得做客人，带上几个朋友会更容易些。
[00:09:49.920]  versus like hosting sometimes in terms of like friend group mixing because as the host you can't
[00:09:49.920] 相比之下，有时候作为东道主，你可能无法让朋友们聚在一起，因为作为东道主你不能……
[00:09:56.160]  just stick with one group or person the whole night you kind of have to like trust them that they'll
[00:09:56.160] 整晚就待在同一个小组或一个人身边，你得信任他们，相信他们会……
[00:10:02.880]  try their best to like make all and socialize. That is true. I actually have like a bunch of thoughts
[00:10:02.880] 他们尽力去喜欢所有人，去社交。的确如此。我其实有很多想法。
[00:10:09.200]  on kind of like the plus one thing though because I guess it depends on what it is if it's like
[00:10:09.200] 有点像加一那样，因为我觉得这取决于它是什么，如果它像……
[00:10:14.640]  a very large and like anonymous party at like a residential neighborhood there's no space capacity
[00:10:14.640] 一场规模非常大、气氛匿名的聚会，地点好像在居民区，根本没有空间容纳。
[00:10:22.160]  or like you know there's no thing that makes it kind of exclusive then it totally makes sense
[00:10:22.160] 或者你知道，如果没有什么特别之处让它显得与众不同，那就完全说得通了。
[00:10:26.800]  to like bring a couple of friends or whatnot but sometimes I feel like invites are meant for just
[00:10:26.800] 比如带上几个朋友什么的，但有时候我觉得邀请函的意义就在于此。
[00:10:32.000]  you and yourself only so then bringing plus ones can be a little bit of like a stretching I guess
[00:10:32.000] 只有你一个人，所以带其他人来可能有点勉强。
[00:10:39.200]  the other person's lenience. It's kind of like asking for something or like asking for a favor
[00:10:39.200] 对方的宽容。这有点像请求别人帮忙或者求人帮忙。
[00:10:44.080]  so then I have thoughts on that a little bit like it really depends on the event type I think
[00:10:44.080] 所以，我对此有一些想法，我觉得这真的取决于事件的类型。
[00:10:49.040]  yeah but I do feel like there's kind of like a time and a place to bring like plus ones or
[00:10:49.040] 是的，但我感觉带伴侣之类的还是要看场合和时间。
[00:10:53.520]  plus a number of guests. That's a good point I didn't even think of it that way. I think I
[00:10:53.520] 再加上一些客人。你说得对，我之前都没想过这一点。我想我
[00:10:59.040]  completely misunderstood the question but you know I agree with you G-Soo and I think a big part
[00:10:59.040] 我完全误解了这个问题，但你知道，我同意你的观点，G-Soo，而且我认为很大一部分原因在于此。
[00:11:05.680]  too is if I'm ever in that situation and I invite someone I would hit them with the it's totally okay
[00:11:05.680] 如果我遇到这种情况，邀请了别人，我也会告诉他们“完全没问题”。
[00:11:12.560]  to say no I know you don't know them feel free to say no and they say yes I'm like just tell me if
[00:11:12.560] 我知道你不认识他们，所以想说“不”就说“不”，如果他们说“是”，我就想，你只要告诉我一声就行了。
[00:11:18.720]  you don't want them but I think a pet peeve of mine is in those instances if I'm inviting someone
[00:11:18.720] 你不想那样，但我个人最讨厌的就是，如果我邀请某人时，对方却不配合。
[00:11:27.200]  or one of my other friends are inviting someone and then they asked to invite more people we can just
[00:11:27.200] 或者我的其他朋友邀请了某人，然后他们又要求邀请更多人，我们就可以这么做了。
[00:11:32.240]  say no and no harm no foul but I would like if they gave me that out as well. I'm like you don't
[00:11:32.240] 说不，没关系，没事的，但我希望他们也能给我这个。我就像你一样，不会这样。
[00:11:38.880]  have to say yes if you don't want to because I kind of feel like an asshole sometimes are just saying
[00:11:38.880] 如果你不想答应，也得答应，因为我有时觉得自己像个混蛋，我只是说说而已。
[00:11:43.760]  no yeah but I think the older I've gotten the more okay I've been with no that's too many people
[00:11:43.760] 不，是的，但我认为我年纪越大，就越能接受人太多这件事。
[00:11:50.640]  that's good. Drawing my boundaries yeah but yeah I feel like in my mind when these boundaries are
[00:11:50.640] 那很好。划清界限是的，但是，我觉得在我的脑海里，当这些界限……
[00:11:57.520]  really strong is probably when it's like a much more intimate gathering and maybe it's like
[00:11:57.520] 真正浓烈的氛围可能出现在更私密的聚会中，也许就像……
[00:12:02.960]  a core friend group that you're like oh we haven't seen each other in so long let's keep it small
[00:12:02.960] 一个核心朋友圈，你会觉得“哎呀，我们好久没见了，还是小聚点吧”。
[00:12:09.440]  especially because I think the less people there are in a gathering accentuates the people who
[00:12:09.440] 尤其是我认为，聚会人数越少，越能凸显出那些……
[00:12:15.040]  are unknown if that makes sense like the you know the one person who is like a plus one doesn't really
[00:12:15.040] 不知道这样说是否合理，就像你知道的，那种“加一”的人其实并不合理。
[00:12:20.480]  know anyone but then everyone else is already like so close and such an intimate gathering.
[00:12:20.480] 虽然我一个都不认识，但其他人都感觉很亲近，聚会气氛非常亲密。
[00:12:26.160]  I wonder in those cases like if the plus one feels even more out of place not necessarily
[00:12:26.160] 我想知道，在那种情况下，比如加一人是否会显得更加格格不入，不一定。
[00:12:32.800]  because people aren't welcoming but just because of the like context honestly crystal I think they
[00:12:32.800] 因为人们并不热情，但说实话，就因为这种背景，我认为他们
[00:12:37.760]  do feel more left out and I think in those situations if you really want to bring someone
[00:12:37.760] 确实会感到被冷落，而且我认为在这种情况下，如果你真的想带某人一起去的话。
[00:12:42.000]  I think it is your job or my job if I'm bringing someone like my job to make sure they integrate
[00:12:42.000] 我认为，如果我带人来，确保他们融入团队是我的职责，要么是你的责任，要么是我的责任。
[00:12:47.200]  with the group. I think one thing that I never really liked is you know if people invite me out
[00:12:47.200] 和大家一起。我觉得我一直不太喜欢的一件事是，你知道，如果别人邀请我出去玩。
[00:12:53.520]  to like hang out with their core group I'm very grateful for it I end up having a blast but like
[00:12:53.520] 能和他们的核心圈子一起玩，我非常感激，最后玩得也很开心，但是……
[00:12:58.640]  if they don't really make an effort to introduce me man that first hour is painful like so how do
[00:12:58.640] 如果他们不努力向我介绍自己，那第一个小时简直太难熬了，所以该怎么办？
[00:13:05.520]  you know so and so. Oh high school that's crazy oh you guys want to call it together that's sick
[00:13:05.520] 你认识某某。哦，高中，太疯狂了。哦，你们想一起上学，真恶心。
[00:13:11.520]  were you in the same major but it's like stuff like that yeah wait I feel like I've heard you have
[00:13:11.520] 你们是同一个专业吗？但就是诸如此类的事情，嗯，等等，我感觉我好像听你说过……
[00:13:16.400]  this exact conversation like many times like this is so familiar to me. I literally have a list of
[00:13:16.400] 这段对话，就像无数次类似的对话一样，对我来说太熟悉了。我甚至列了一张清单……
[00:13:21.920]  small talk talking points in my head and as soon as I meet someone I run through it some of my friends
[00:13:21.920] 我脑子里记着一些闲聊的话题，一见到人就马上过一遍，我的一些朋友也这么做。
[00:13:29.360]  like I'm sure you two have heard it other friends who I've known for a lot longer actually I've
[00:13:29.360] 我相信你们俩肯定也听过这话，其实我认识更久的其他朋友也都听过。
[00:13:34.080]  known Jesus for really long. Other friends that have seen me in these social environments more they
[00:13:34.080] 我认识耶稣很久了。其他在这些社交场合见过我的朋友，他们更多地……
[00:13:40.640]  as soon as they hear me say one thing they know the next question I'm gonna ask because it's just so
[00:13:40.640] 他们一听到我说一句话，就知道我接下来要问什么问题了，因为这太……
[00:13:45.680]  structured. They've got it memorized. They gotta memorize and then if I ask a certain question they're
[00:13:45.680] 结构化。他们已经记住了。他们必须记住，然后如果我问某个问题，他们就能回答。
[00:13:51.040]  like oh Jonathan's gonna say this story now. I say this story. Dude this is like NPC behavior.
[00:13:51.040] 哦，乔纳森现在又要讲这个故事了。我也要讲这个故事。老兄，这简直就像NPC的行为一样。
[00:13:58.080]  It's like a decision tree that he's already mapped out. It honestly is yeah but it makes
[00:13:58.080] 这就像他已经规划好的决策树一样。确实如此，但这也……
[00:14:12.160]  it so much easier to just go like autopilot sometimes for sure and I mean like you can't blame some
[00:14:12.160] 有时候，像自动驾驶一样行事确实容易得多，我的意思是，你不能责怪某些人。
[00:14:18.480]  of the small talk questions like some of them get really good information out and it does sometimes
[00:14:18.480] 有些闲聊问题确实能套出一些很有用的信息，而且有时确实如此。
[00:14:23.360]  spark a bigger or more complex conversation. Exactly I think too it's like these small talk questions
[00:14:23.360] 引发更深入或更复杂的对话。没错，我也这么认为，就像这些闲聊问题一样。
[00:14:31.360]  are also a litmus test on like how well you can get along with the person because if they respond
[00:14:31.360] 这也是检验你和对方相处是否融洽的试金石，因为如果他们回应
[00:14:36.880]  very well to it if I'm like oh how do you know this person and then they dive into it they're like
[00:14:36.880] 如果我问“你是怎么认识这个人的？”，然后他们滔滔不绝地讲起来，他们就会说：“很好。”
[00:14:41.120]  I've known it since elementary school we've been really close friends tells me some stories about it
[00:14:41.120] 我从小学就认识它了，我们一直是很好的朋友，它给我讲过一些关于它的故事。
[00:14:45.200]  I'm like I can really chop it up with this person yeah but if they're just like oh we just knew each
[00:14:45.200] 我感觉我可以和这个人好好聊聊，但如果他们只是说“哦，我们只是认识而已”，那就没办法了。
[00:14:49.760]  other from like college and that was it I'd be like cool like fuck me right I'll go now.
[00:14:49.760] 除了大学之类的，就那样了，我会觉得酷，就像“我去，我现在就走”。
[00:14:56.320]  This also kind of reminds me of that meme of one mutual friend bringing two other friends together
[00:14:56.320] 这让我想起了那个梗图，讲的是一个共同的朋友把另外两个朋友撮合到一起。
[00:15:03.280]  and then the moment they leave like the lunch table or whatever the two are like so uh how do you
[00:15:03.280] 然后他们一离开，比如午餐桌旁什么的，这两个人就好像……呃，你怎么……
[00:15:09.760]  know this friend? 100% yeah yeah I feel like there's definitely an art to even when you do bring a guest
[00:15:09.760] 认识这位朋友吗？当然认识！我觉得即使带客人来，也绝对是一门艺术。
[00:15:18.000]  or like our primitive to bring a guest making sure that that guest integrates well and like has fun
[00:15:18.000] 或者像我们原始的做法一样，带一位客人来，确保这位客人能够很好地融入并玩得开心。
[00:15:23.200]  because I don't know even if like the normal friend group is having fun if the one person who's a
[00:15:23.200] 因为我不知道，即使像平常那样的朋友圈玩得开心，如果那个人……
[00:15:28.240]  plus one is not having fun in a corner I feel like that can also be like a mood dampener so it's
[00:15:28.240] 而且，一个人待在角落里不开心，我觉得那也会很扫兴，所以……
[00:15:32.560]  also for the social good as well to make sure that the plus that's having fun. That's probably why
[00:15:32.560] 也是为了社会公益，确保大家都能从中获得乐趣。这大概就是原因吧。
[00:15:37.760]  it always works a little better in like a slightly larger party setting where you know there's
[00:15:37.760] 在稍微大一点的聚会场合，效果总是会更好一些，因为你知道周围有人。
[00:15:43.120]  a bit of alcohol you know people are a little loosened up and feeling a little more relaxed so
[00:15:43.120] 你知道，喝了点酒之后，人们会放松一些，感觉更自在一些。
[00:15:49.360]  it's a little easier to make conversation even if we like don't really make that much sense or
[00:15:49.360] 即使我们说的话其实没什么意义，也更容易展开对话。
[00:15:54.800]  it's like very shallow conversation everyone's excited because they're in a good mood and the vibes
[00:15:54.800] 就像是很肤浅的对话，每个人都很兴奋，因为他们心情很好，气氛也很好。
[00:15:59.680]  are good. A question for you guys how do you guys make sure that your friends or your plus ones
[00:15:59.680] 很好。问问你们，你们是如何确保你们的朋友或伴侣的安全的？
[00:16:07.200]  feel included in the group what is your strategy? This might be a little counterintuitive but I think
[00:16:07.200] 融入群体的感觉如何？你的策略是什么？这可能有点违反直觉，但我认为
[00:16:13.440]  sometimes bringing like an S.O. I don't always want to be like oh this is my boyfriend or whatever
[00:16:13.440] 有时候带对象来也没什么特别的。我并不总是想表现得好像“哦，这是我男朋友”之类的。
[00:16:20.400]  because then that makes everyone associate that person as like oh that's Crystal's boyfriend
[00:16:20.400] 因为那样一来，大家都会把那个人跟克丽丝塔尔的男朋友联系起来。
[00:16:26.240]  not like that's their own person if that's the situation then I'll bring them and like maybe
[00:16:26.240] 不是说那是他们自己的事，如果真是那样的话，我会带他们去，也许吧。
[00:16:32.320]  introduce them a bit with me but then like at a certain point kind of like break off a little
[00:16:32.320] 先简单介绍一下他们，但到了某个时候就稍微分开一下。
[00:16:38.560]  bit if it's a bigger party just so that they can like establish themselves as their own person
[00:16:38.560] 但如果是个规模更大的派对，他们就可能借此机会确立自己的独立地位。
[00:16:44.240]  and they can like you know go out and socialize as well and I think it also shows oh this person
[00:16:44.240] 他们也可以出去社交，我觉得这也能体现出这个人是什么样的人。
[00:16:48.880]  has some social skills like a normal person like they don't have to rely on you fully in like a
[00:16:48.880] 他们具备一些正常人的社交技能，比如他们不需要完全依赖你。
[00:16:59.520]  social setting which I think is like a pro just to have as like a general skill. I think that's
[00:16:59.520] 社交能力在我看来就像一项必备的通用技能，应该掌握。我觉得这很重要。
[00:17:06.640]  a good tip especially when you're someone's S.O. you can definitely be doomed to being like just their
[00:17:06.640] 这真是个好建议，尤其当你成为某人的伴侣时，你很可能最终会变成他们唯一的伴侣。
[00:17:12.400]  S.O. but I'm trying to think of like when I brought a friend to a different friend group hangout
[00:17:12.400] 所以，我努力回想一下，就像我带朋友去另一个朋友聚会的时候那样。
[00:17:18.400]  for example I feel like the one thing I'll do is like when I introduce people I'll try to give
[00:17:18.400] 例如，我觉得我要做一件事，就是当我介绍别人时，我会尽量……
[00:17:24.240]  interesting tidbits about each other so that there's like some sort of starting point and then
[00:17:24.240] 互相分享一些有趣的小细节，这样就有了某种起点，然后
[00:17:28.720]  they can kind of talk based on that or I'll also make sure to like sort of poke fun at the plus
[00:17:28.720] 他们可以就此展开讨论，或者我也会拿加号开个玩笑。
[00:17:34.800]  one so that it's like in a normal friend group everyone's kind of like making fun of each other
[00:17:34.800] 一是就像在一个普通的朋友圈里，每个人都会互相开玩笑。
[00:17:40.640]  so then I feel like by doing that to the plus one to it kind of like opens up the battle ground a
[00:17:40.640] 所以我觉得这样做，再加上一个额外的步骤，就有点像打开了战场。
[00:17:44.800]  little bit and that's kind of like the easiest or like fastest way to get close to somewhat right.
[00:17:44.800] 稍微做一点，这算是最简单或者最快接近正确答案的方法了。
[00:17:48.880]  Yeah I think for me I really similar to G-SOO I kind of just start shitting on people.
[00:17:48.880] 是的，我觉得我和G-SOO很像，我经常会开始贬低别人。
[00:17:54.160]  I think my relationship with my friends is a lot of them shit on me too so like a common thread
[00:17:54.160] 我觉得我和朋友的关系就是，他们很多人也都在背后说我坏话，这就像一条共同的线索。
[00:17:59.680]  between all the friends I make is they all one way or another will end up shitting on me.
[00:17:59.680] 我交的所有朋友，最终都会以某种方式伤害我。
[00:18:04.800]  I will take it on the chin I'll take the fall but if everyone's shit talking me makes everyone get
[00:18:04.800] 我会坦然接受，我会承担责任，但如果每个人都在背后议论我，那就让每个人都……
[00:18:11.920]  closer then you know it makes it a lot easier. Like as long as it's friendly hopefully yeah I think
[00:18:11.920] 距离越近，事情就越容易解决。只要对方友好就好，我想应该是这样。
[00:18:18.160]  another good tactic is if you think there's someone who is like good at making friends good at
[00:18:18.160] 另一个好策略是，如果你认为有人很擅长交朋友，或者很……
[00:18:24.960]  socializing you could be like oh let's all take a shot with that person and then I feel like
[00:18:24.960] 社交时你可能会想，哦，咱们都和那个人喝一杯吧，然后我就觉得……
[00:18:30.720]  that kind of opens things up. Taking a shot together is somehow very like socially inclusive
[00:18:30.720] 这样一来，事情就变得容易多了。一起喝酒在某种程度上就很有社交包容性。
[00:18:38.000]  I think and it usually makes people feel like a part of something so then I think from there
[00:18:38.000] 我认为，这通常会让人觉得自己是某个群体的一部分，然后我就会从那里开始思考。
[00:18:43.520]  usually like conversation stem or as people branch off from the shot they're like oh hey
[00:18:43.520] 通常就像对话的开端，或者当人们从镜头中脱离出来时，他们会说“哦，嘿”。
[00:18:47.760]  like I don't think I saw you earlier what's your name and then you know things happen.
[00:18:47.760] 我好像之前没见过你，你叫什么名字？然后你知道，事情就是这样发生的。
[00:18:52.160]  Yeah that's a good point. I've literally done that with James before.
[00:18:52.160] 没错，你说得对。我之前确实对詹姆斯这么做过。
[00:18:56.960]  Like if I'm throwing something on my place and then some people don't know James as well
[00:18:56.960] 比如，如果我把什么东西放在我家，而有些人又不认识詹姆斯。
[00:19:00.880]  I'm literally like dude let's take a shot of my friend James and then this is followed up by some
[00:19:00.880] 我当时就想，哥们儿，咱们拍张我朋友詹姆斯的照片吧，然后接下来就发生了一些事……
[00:19:07.040]  small talk and then possibly some shit talking. Oh yeah that's another good one like party games
[00:19:07.040] 闲聊几句，然后可能还会说些闲话。哦对，派对游戏也是个不错的选择。
[00:19:14.960]  and stuff. Usually you partner up with your plus one or whatever and then you're like okay let's
[00:19:14.960] 诸如此类。通常你会和你的伴侣或其他什么人结伴而行，然后你们就会说，好吧，我们开始吧。
[00:19:20.000]  play against these people and then there's some like shit talking, there's some competition either
[00:19:20.000] 和这些人比赛，然后就会有人说些垃圾话，但也存在一些竞争。
[00:19:24.960]  way like you get talking and I feel like at the end of the game it's always like oh okay good
[00:19:24.960] 就像你跟人聊天的时候，我觉得游戏结束的时候总是会觉得“哦，好吧，不错”。
[00:19:30.080]  game like we've gained respect for each other so then from there it's also like a stepping point.
[00:19:30.080] 就像我们通过游戏建立了彼此的尊重，所以从那以后，这也像是一个跳板。
[00:19:35.520]  Yeah I feel like all of these just point to like a party setting is sort of the easiest place
[00:19:35.520] 是的，我觉得所有这些都表明，聚会场合是最容易发生这种情况的地方。
[00:19:40.160]  to mix friend groups because I just can't imagine what the easy way would be in like the dinner
[00:19:40.160] 把朋友们混在一起，因为我实在想象不出在晚餐之类的场合，最简单的办法会是什么样。
[00:19:46.800]  in like a dinner setting for example if you have two friend groups that are mixed
[00:19:46.800] 例如，在类似晚餐的场合，如果你有两个不同背景的朋友群体。
[00:19:50.400]  the only real thing that I could think of is maybe talking about like anecdotes and whatnot but
[00:19:50.400] 我唯一能想到的就是讲些轶事之类的，但是
[00:19:54.640]  that requires way more coordination way more like storytelling and like creativity than just being
[00:19:54.640] 那需要更多的协调，更像是讲故事和创造，而不仅仅是存在。
[00:20:01.600]  like okay who wants to play rage cake or like who wants to get shot so they're like shortcuts.
[00:20:01.600] 比如，谁想玩愤怒蛋糕？或者谁想被枪击？所以这就像是捷径。
[00:20:07.360]  Actually I have had oh my god I had the funniest situation so I was visiting New York once
[00:20:07.360] 其实我曾经遇到过一件超级搞笑的事，当时我正在纽约旅行。
[00:20:13.520]  and I made plans to catch up with my friend and she's like a singular friend like not really part
[00:20:13.520] 我计划和朋友聚聚，她就像个独一无二的朋友，不太像个圈内人。
[00:20:19.840]  of a friend group the way that we like met and became friends but our core friend group in New York
[00:20:19.840] 我们相识并成为朋友的方式，以及我们在纽约的核心朋友圈，都让我们印象深刻。
[00:20:26.080]  I think they caught wind of this they're like oh Crystal what are you doing on Friday or whatever
[00:20:26.080] 我觉得他们可能已经察觉到这件事了，他们会问：“克丽丝塔尔，你周五有什么安排吗？”之类的。
[00:20:29.680]  I was like oh I'm going to a bar catching up with one of my friends and they're like I wanted to go
[00:20:29.680] 我当时就想，哦，我要去酒吧和朋友叙叙旧，结果他们说我也想去。
[00:20:33.120]  that to that bar too you can say no but like it's okay if we join and then you know what started off
[00:20:33.120] 去那家酒吧你也可以说不，但如果我们一起去也没关系，然后你知道是怎么开始的。
[00:20:39.200]  as like a one-on-one turned into like a whole table of I think it was maybe like seven or eight of us
[00:20:39.200] 本来是一对一的谈话，结果变成了一整桌人，我想大概有七八个人吧。
[00:20:45.360]  oh my god but like my original friend she's not part of that core friend group so in that situation
[00:20:45.360] 我的天哪，但就像我原来的朋友一样，她并不属于那个核心朋友圈，所以在这种情况下……
[00:20:52.960]  I did have to try a bit to like oh you know this is my friend met her in New York blah blah and I
[00:20:52.960] 我确实得稍微努力一下，比如“哦，你知道，这是我的朋友，我在纽约认识她的”等等等等，然后我
[00:20:58.240]  think because it was a seated situation it worked out okay because I sat right next to her and then
[00:20:58.240] 我觉得因为是坐着的，所以还算顺利，因为我就坐在她旁边。
[00:21:03.680]  she could talk to the people sitting across from her and then I could help facilitate some of the
[00:21:03.680] 她可以和坐在对面的人交谈，然后我可以帮忙协调一些事情。
[00:21:08.960]  conversation on the topic of seating I hate it when I'm sitting in a big group and I end up like
[00:21:08.960] 关于座位安排的话题，我最讨厌的就是和一大群人坐在一起，最后发现自己很尴尬。
[00:21:15.600]  near people I don't know that well oh yeah just like fuck what do I even talk about here and we're
[00:21:15.600] 和不太熟悉的人待在一起，哦，是啊，我该说什么才好呢？我们……
[00:21:20.880]  eating too so I'm gonna have to sit there for like an hour oh my god true I feel like it's so
[00:21:20.880] 我还要吃东西，所以我得在那儿坐一个小时，我的天哪，真的，我觉得太难熬了。
[00:21:25.520]  important to sit next to the plus one or whoever is like the additional ad not to make them sound
[00:21:25.520] 重要的是要坐在陪同人员旁边，或者任何像额外广告一样的人旁边，以免让他们听起来像是在做广告。
[00:21:32.480]  like unwelcome already big but I feel like it just helps ease their mind so much more because
[00:21:32.480] 虽然已经很不受欢迎了，但我感觉这反而能让他们安心很多，因为
[00:21:39.840]  it's like okay if all goes terribly I can at least default to talking to this good friend who's
[00:21:39.840] 就好像，好吧，如果一切都糟透了，我至少还可以和这位好朋友倾诉。
[00:21:45.280]  sitting next to me I think it makes it easier for everyone else in the group too because you know
[00:21:45.280] 我觉得坐在我旁边对小组里的其他人来说也更容易一些，因为你知道
[00:21:50.320]  the plus one is out on the side than everyone else around them is gonna feel like they're gonna
[00:21:50.320] 如果带上一个朋友的人站在一边，周围的人都会觉得他们好像要……
[00:21:54.560]  feel bad for not talking to them so they'll make an effort but then it's like they don't know them
[00:21:54.560] 因为没跟他们说话而感到内疚，所以他们会努力尝试，但结果却好像他们根本不认识他们。
[00:21:58.560]  like that it is kind of funny sometimes though because I guess depending on the size of the dinner
[00:21:58.560] 有时候这样想还挺搞笑的，因为我觉得这取决于晚餐的规模。
[00:22:03.440]  sometimes there's multiple conversations going on sometimes there's like one central convo
[00:22:03.440] 有时会同时进行多场对话，有时则只有一个中心对话。
[00:22:08.720]  and then maybe like a side convo so then when there's one central convo going on and it's
[00:22:08.720] 然后可能还会穿插一些旁支对话，这样当一个主要对话正在进行时，其他对话就没那么重要了。
[00:22:13.520]  like the normal banter shit talking funny stories whatnot and then the plus one is having just
[00:22:13.520] 就像平常那样闲聊、说些有意思的故事等等，然后你的伴侣就只是……
[00:22:18.400]  like a really regular like small talk conversation with the person sitting next to them I feel like
[00:22:18.400] 感觉就像和旁边的人进行非常普通的闲聊一样。
[00:22:23.200]  it's hell of funny it's like people shooting the shit and then it's like oh yeah like what school did
[00:22:23.200] 真是太搞笑了，就像人们闲聊，然后突然冒出一句“哦，对了，比如学校干了什么”。
[00:22:28.080]  you go to? Aside from like just the one or two friends being mixed into a bigger group do you think
[00:22:28.080] 你会去哪里？除了像一两个朋友混进一个更大的团体之外，你觉得……
[00:22:35.920]  you have any strategies for like bigger friend mixing as in like maybe two core groups get mixed
[00:22:35.920] 你有什么策略来促进更多朋友之间的交流，比如让两个核心群体融合在一起？
[00:22:43.600]  together I think like we were talking about earlier with bigger friend groups too I think parties
[00:22:43.600] 我觉得就像我们之前讨论的那样，和更大的朋友群体一起聚会也挺好的。
[00:22:48.640]  is definitely the easiest to mix them but even without it being a party I think I don't really
[00:22:48.640] 混合它们肯定是最容易的，但即使不是在开派对，我觉得我也不太会这么做。
[00:22:54.960]  have a strategy per se I kind of just talk to everyone like I went normally and I just try to
[00:22:54.960] 我并没有制定什么策略，我只是像往常一样和每个人聊天，然后尽量……
[00:23:00.160]  stuff everyone into the same conversation act as a facilitator of the conversation
[00:23:00.160] 让所有人参与到同一对话中，并充当对话的协调者。
[00:23:05.440]  and then eventually one or two people will start shit talking me or someone else
[00:23:05.440] 然后最终总会有一两个人开始说我或其他人坏话。
[00:23:10.240]  and then it'll just open the flood gates from there I think a big part of mixing bigger friend groups
[00:23:10.240] 然后，我觉得这就打开了潘多拉的魔盒，让更多的朋友群体融合在一起。
[00:23:15.360]  for me is just my inherent trust in their personality I'm like listen they're cool they're
[00:23:15.360] 对我来说，这完全是出于我对他们人格的信任。我会想，听着，他们很酷，他们
[00:23:22.240]  fibers I'm sure they'll vibe with each other we all have similar personalities here there have been
[00:23:22.240] 我相信这些纤维会彼此契合，我们这里的人性格都很相似，一直以来都是如此。
[00:23:27.920]  a few situations though where like certain groups the personality I have with them is different
[00:23:27.920] 不过，在某些情况下，比如某些群体，我和他们相处时的性格会有所不同。
[00:23:34.240]  than mine with other groups so I tend not to mix those groups in you're like they can't
[00:23:34.240] 比起我的其他团体，我倾向于不把那些团体混在一起，就像他们不能那样。
[00:23:41.040]  they can't know the professional side of me I was gonna bring that up actually because I think
[00:23:41.040] 他们不可能了解我的专业一面，我其实正想提一下这一点，因为我觉得
[00:23:47.440]  we've talked pretty positively about mixing friend groups but at least for me personally it can
[00:23:47.440] 我们之前对朋友群体混杂这件事讨论得相当积极，但至少对我个人而言，这可能……
[00:23:52.800]  sometimes be a source of anxiety I say that as someone who actually enjoys mixing friend groups
[00:23:52.800] 有时这会成为焦虑的来源。我这么说是因为我其实很喜欢混搭不同的朋友群体。
[00:23:58.080]  I just find it a little bit hard to like mentally prepare for it and like strategize for it because
[00:23:58.080] 我发现很难在心理上做好准备，也很难制定应对策略，因为
[00:24:04.720]  I have a lot of intentionality when I mix friend groups so then sometimes I think grappling
[00:24:04.720] 我安排不同朋友群体聚会时会格外用心，所以有时候我会觉得很棘手。
[00:24:10.560]  with the different personalities that I have for like each friend group or you know the different
[00:24:10.560] 我和不同性格的朋友相处的方式各不相同，比如不同的朋友群体。
[00:24:15.040]  memories that you have associated with each friend group are so different I feel like I have to
[00:24:15.040] 你与每个朋友群体相关的回忆都如此不同，我觉得我必须……
[00:24:19.840]  like average all of them into one before going into like a mixed friend group paying out such
[00:24:19.840] 就像把他们所有人平均化为一体，然后再加入一个混合的朋友团体，支付这样的费用。
[00:24:26.560]  yeah I can totally see that even something as simple as like high school versus college
[00:24:26.560] 是的，我完全能理解，即使是像高中和大学这样简单的事情也会造成影响。
[00:24:32.160]  you're still like the same person but I feel like you go through a lot of change so then sometimes
[00:24:32.160] 你还是原来的你，但我感觉你经历了很多变化，所以有时候
[00:24:36.720]  there's just some differences you can't help and I think like it's also interesting because it's like
[00:24:36.720] 有些差异是无法避免的，我觉得这也很有趣，因为它就像……
[00:24:42.000]  these people have only seen me in this segment of my life but these other people have seen me
[00:24:42.000] 这些人只见过我人生中的这一段，而其他人则见过我整个人生。
[00:24:46.480]  through like everything maybe or whatever it's kind of like they won't have the context that
[00:24:46.480] 或许通过所有事情，或者不管怎样，他们可能不太了解情况。
[00:24:51.440]  these other friend groups have yeah exactly that's true you guys think you guys have changed a lot
[00:24:51.440] 其他朋友圈也确实如此，没错，你们觉得自己变化很大。
[00:24:56.880]  since high school till now um maybe not that much but I do think in college if there was a graph
[00:24:56.880] 从高中到现在，嗯，也许没那么多，但我认为在大学里，如果有个图表的话……
[00:25:06.160]  college goes up of it in terms of my personal social activity so I think everyone who has met me before
[00:25:06.160] 大学生活极大地丰富了我的个人社交活动，所以我觉得所有认识我的人都会这么认为。
[00:25:15.920]  and after would be like oh wow like I guess you did a lot in college like you were very social
[00:25:15.920] 之后可能会说，哇，看来你在大学里做了很多事，你很善于社交。
[00:25:23.040]  I think for me every year of my life has felt so vastly different and I feel like my personality
[00:25:23.040] 我觉得我生命中的每一年都截然不同，而且我觉得我的性格
[00:25:30.640]  and my mood spectrum changes very vividly like every year so then I feel like that also contributes
[00:25:30.640] 我的情绪波动非常剧烈，几乎每年都会变化，所以我觉得这也有一定的影响。
[00:25:36.400]  to the anxiety a little bit of the mixing friend groups where I'm like this person and I were
[00:25:36.400] 有点焦虑的是，我经常会和不同的朋友群体混在一起，比如这个人，而我……
[00:25:41.280]  very close back in insert year and back then I felt like a completely different person than now
[00:25:41.280] 大约在[年份]年，那时我感觉自己和现在完全是两个人。
[00:25:46.240]  so then that's why I think sometimes it's a little bit hard for me to like almost decide
[00:25:46.240] 所以这就是为什么我觉得有时候我很难做出决定的原因。
[00:25:51.360]  how I should portray myself or like how I should try to feel that day but it's really more of
[00:25:51.360] 我应该如何展现自己，或者那天我应该努力让自己感觉如何，但实际上更多的是……
[00:25:56.400]  like this exercise that causes the anxiety right like I think the actual mixing of the friend group
[00:25:56.400] 就像这种会引发焦虑的练习一样，我觉得就像朋友群体的实际融合一样。
[00:26:00.720]  is usually fine it's more of like all the thinking the kind of like mental hoops that I have
[00:26:00.720] 通常没什么大碍，主要是各种思考，就像我脑子里那些乱七八糟的想法。
[00:26:06.000]  to jump through beforehand that makes it more painful yeah you know that makes sense I think
[00:26:06.000] 事先跳过这些步骤会更痛苦，嗯，你知道，这很有道理，我想。
[00:26:10.960]  something that kind of helps and I've done this in the past is to have an event where people
[00:26:10.960] 过去我也做过类似的事情，那就是举办一个活动，让人们……
[00:26:17.440]  can do stuff so I don't think I realized in the moment when I was like planning this but I
[00:26:17.440] 我能做很多事，所以我想我当时在计划这件事的时候并没有意识到这一点，但是
[00:26:23.760]  think it was in the back of my mind that it's like oh if I'm gonna host something where like there's
[00:26:23.760] 我当时心里想的是，如果我要主持某个活动，比如……
[00:26:28.880]  going to be a lot of people from different areas of my life I hope they have stuff to do so if
[00:26:28.880] 届时会有很多来自我生活各个领域的人，我希望他们都有事可做。
[00:26:36.160]  there's any awkward silence they could just be like all right let's just fucking go do that activity
[00:26:36.160] 如果出现任何尴尬的沉默，他们完全可以这样说：“好了，咱们他妈的赶紧去做那项活动吧。”
[00:26:41.520]  over there so an example is like my previous couple birthdays I've done like a big karaoke thing in
[00:26:41.520] 那边，举个例子，就像我前几个生日，我都办过大型卡拉OK活动。
[00:26:49.360]  New York and then last year I did mini golf and I feel like that just kind of fills the potential
[00:26:49.360] 我先去了纽约，去年又玩了迷你高尔夫，感觉这正好满足了我的所有需求。
[00:26:55.760]  silence right you're like okay I'm just gonna go play around with any golf now 100% I think the
[00:26:55.760] 沉默，你就会想，好吧，我现在就去随便玩玩高尔夫吧，100% 我觉得
[00:27:01.600]  activities you did were really good too crystal because they're like big groups can interact but
[00:27:01.600] 克里斯托，你组织的活动也真的很好，因为它们可以让大组人员互动，但是
[00:27:05.920]  it's like if smaller groups want to like they're not as comfortable they can still break off and do
[00:27:05.920] 这就好比，如果人数较少的群体觉得不太自在，他们仍然可以脱离群体单独行动。
[00:27:09.760]  their own thing yeah I feel like activities are actually really smart because my greatest fear is like
[00:27:09.760] 他们自己的事情，是的，我觉得这些活动其实真的很聪明，因为我最大的恐惧是……
[00:27:15.520]  mixing friend groups is like a choice right like you don't have to mix friend groups so then when
[00:27:15.520] 混搭朋友圈就像是一种选择，对吧？你完全可以不混搭朋友圈，所以当……
[00:27:20.240]  I'm choosing to mix friend groups I don't want it to be at the expense of something so for example
[00:27:20.240] 我选择将不同的朋友群体融合在一起，但我不想因此而牺牲任何东西，例如
[00:27:27.520]  if I could have two separate hangouts with two separate friend groups and it's more fun that way
[00:27:27.520] 如果我可以和两群不同的朋友分别聚会，那样会更有趣。
[00:27:32.320]  than I would prefer to do it that way but if I have one hangout and I mix the friend groups and
[00:27:32.320] 我更倾向于那样做，但如果我只组织一次聚会，把不同的朋友群体混在一起，
[00:27:36.560]  it's more fun than I would prefer that right so then sometimes my greatest fear is like okay what if
[00:27:36.560] 这比我预想的更有趣，对吧？所以有时候我最大的恐惧是，如果……会怎样？
[00:27:41.360]  I do mix friend groups and this hangout and then at the end of it all it's just not as fun as if
[00:27:41.360] 我确实会把不同的朋友群体和这个聚会混在一起，但最终发现，这样反而不如以前那么有趣了。
[00:27:47.520]  I did like two separate ones with them you know what I mean dude but I have a counter question yeah
[00:27:47.520] 我跟他们分别做了两件事，你知道我的意思吧，兄弟，但我有个反问，嗯。
[00:27:53.840]  what if you don't mix the friend groups but then like one of the activities that you do with one
[00:27:53.840] 如果你不把不同的朋友群体混在一起，但比如你和其中一个朋友一起参加的活动，会怎么样？
[00:27:59.840]  of the friend groups is more fun than the other one and then people from the other one see
[00:27:59.840] 其中一个朋友圈比另一个更有趣，然后另一个朋友圈的人就会看到
[00:28:05.520]  you know the more fun one and then they're like damn what the fuck like how come we get there
[00:28:05.520] 你知道，就是那种更有趣的情况，然后他们会说，卧槽，我们怎么会到那儿？
[00:28:12.400]  that's true I guess you would have to make it exactly the same just repeat the same thing
[00:28:12.400] 没错，我想你必须完全一样地重复同样的事情。
[00:28:19.600]  honestly the more we're talking about the more I'm thinking about it I'm like I don't even know if
[00:28:19.600] 说实话，我们聊得越多，我就越想这个问题，我甚至都不知道该怎么回答了。
[00:28:24.000]  I mix that many big groups I feel like I slowly just introduce more and more people into the group
[00:28:24.000] 我把很多大团体混在一起，感觉就像在慢慢地把越来越多的人引入到这个团体里。
[00:28:31.600]  so it's just everyone just knows each other by the end well like I'm pretty sure both of you have
[00:28:31.600] 所以到最后大家都彼此很熟悉了，就像我确信你们俩一样。
[00:28:36.400]  already met most of my other friends yeah honestly that's a good strategy though yeah to be honest
[00:28:36.400] 我已经见过我其他大部分朋友了，说实话，这确实是个好策略。
[00:28:44.480]  after because you slowly bring more and more people into this big amorphous group of friends
[00:28:44.480] 之后，你会慢慢地把越来越多的人纳入这个庞大而松散的朋友圈。
[00:28:50.160]  it's like some of them end up getting really close like I know some of my friends are forget
[00:28:50.160] 感觉他们中的一些人最终会变得非常亲密，我知道我的一些朋友已经忘记了。
[00:28:54.400]  what I was talking to them about but they're like oh yeah the other day I want those two like
[00:28:54.400] 我跟他们聊的就是这个，但他们却说，哦，对啊，前几天我想要那两个人，就像
[00:28:59.200]  this like warehouse party and I'm like you just didn't even invite me
[00:28:59.200] 这简直就是个仓库派对，我心想你们居然都没邀请我。
[00:29:04.880]  do you see that as like a sign of success or are you kind of like down DFTI?
[00:29:04.880] 你认为这是成功的标志吗？还是你有点失望？
[00:29:08.960]  well I see that as a sign of success because then now I'm like dude I can hang out with all of them
[00:29:08.960] 我觉得这是成功的标志，因为那样的话，我就想，老兄，我可以和他们所有人一起玩了。
[00:29:14.800]  together and I don't even need a worry like that's great you're like wow I'm the one left out
[00:29:14.800] 我们在一起，我甚至都不用担心，这太好了，你会说，哇，我被落下了。
[00:29:20.480]  of the conversation exactly but I guess in that strategy it's more like smaller friend group
[00:29:20.480] 对话内容确实如此，但我觉得在这种策略下，它更像是针对较小的朋友群体。
[00:29:27.920]  mixing moments similar to what we were talking about in the beginning where it's like maybe the
[00:29:27.920] 混合一些类似于我们一开始讨论的那种时刻，就像……
[00:29:32.800]  plus one or two and then slowly incorporating in the end it's like all these small efforts have
[00:29:32.800] 再加上一两个，然后慢慢地整合起来，最终就像所有这些小的努力都汇聚成了一个整体。
[00:29:40.640]  succeeded into like the overall big effort yeah I guess I'm trying to think back and at this point
[00:29:40.640] 成功地完成了这项巨大的努力，是的，我想我正在努力回想，而现在……
[00:29:48.160]  in our lives especially like post wedding post bachelor party and all of that I feel like all
[00:29:48.160] 在我们的生活中，尤其是在婚礼之后、单身派对之后等等，我觉得所有这些都……
[00:29:53.120]  of our friends are pretty cool with each other like close to each other have inside jokes and
[00:29:53.120] 我们的朋友之间关系很好，很亲密，有很多只有彼此才懂的笑话。
[00:29:56.880]  whatnot but trying to recall like back in the day when we first started mixing James' high school
[00:29:56.880] 什么的，但努力回忆起当年我们刚开始混音的时候，詹姆斯的高中
[00:30:02.240]  friend group who's like one of our core friend groups essentially and our college friend group
[00:30:02.240] 朋友圈，基本上就是我们核心朋友圈之一，还有我们的大学朋友圈。
[00:30:07.280]  and I remember it felt like such a big deal back then and everyone that kind of known each other
[00:30:07.280] 我记得当时感觉这件事意义重大，而且所有认识的人都觉得这件事非同小可。
[00:30:12.720]  through like rames or like events that we had gone through in college but it still felt like
[00:30:12.720] 虽然经历过一些类似我们在大学期间遇到的事情，但仍然感觉像是
[00:30:18.720]  okay we're intentionally mixing friend groups and I definitely remember some more awkward moments
[00:30:18.720] 好吧，我们故意把不同的朋友群体混在一起，我当然还记得一些更尴尬的时刻。
[00:30:25.120]  and moments where maybe things didn't go as smoothly especially when I don't know like how would
[00:30:25.120] 还有一些时候，事情可能进展得不太顺利，尤其是我不知道该如何是好的时候。
[00:30:32.080]  you describe it Crystal I mean you guys were both there for these right it's like sometimes
[00:30:32.080] 克丽丝塔尔，你描述得真好。我的意思是，你们俩当时都在场，对吧？有时候就是这样。
[00:30:35.760]  I feel like those are so awkward I think like especially when people just defaulted to their normal
[00:30:35.760] 我觉得那些场景真的很尴尬，尤其是当人们都恢复到平常状态的时候。
[00:30:41.520]  oh yeah group I was guilty of that I was I could have made it I was guilty of that
[00:30:41.520] 哦，是的，我承认我犯了那个错误，我本来可以做到的，我承认我犯了那个错误。
[00:30:48.000]  I truly didn't talk to like James' like high school group until
[00:30:48.000] 直到最近，我才真正和詹姆斯的高中同学们说上话。
[00:30:52.560]  she got probably like the bachelor party it's like when I really talked to them but before that
[00:30:52.560] 她大概是参加了单身派对，就像我真正和他们交谈的那次一样，但在此之前。
[00:30:58.000]  it's like I would talk to them but it's like unless there's an activity we were all doing together
[00:30:58.000] 感觉就像我会跟他们聊天，但除非我们一起参加什么活动，否则我们很难有机会交流。
[00:31:03.200]  it was much more comfortable to just like default to the people you know better yeah maybe
[00:31:03.200] 和自己更熟悉的人相处确实更舒服，也许吧。
[00:31:09.360]  because it was like such established groups and then it was like almost forced in a way guys
[00:31:09.360] 因为那就像是一些已经成型的团体，然后感觉有点像是被迫的。
[00:31:15.680]  let's all hang out together so then it was just like oh okay well I feel more comfortable talking
[00:31:15.680] 咱们一起出去玩吧，然后我就觉得，哦，好吧，我觉得跟人聊天更自在些。
[00:31:21.520]  with this group so but what's so interesting is that like James and I are in the same high school
[00:31:21.520] 和这个群体在一起，但有趣的是，我和詹姆斯在同一所高中。
[00:31:27.360]  friend group so like James and I know both of the friend groups and then G-Zooh is also you know
[00:31:27.360] 朋友圈，比如我和詹姆斯都认识这两个朋友圈，还有G-Zooh，你也知道。
[00:31:33.520]  like G-Zooh hangs out with the high school friend group a lot and then also you know we have the
[00:31:33.520] 比如G-Zooh经常和高中朋友一起玩，而且你知道我们还有
[00:31:37.680]  college friend group so like us three were kind of in the middle and then we're just like oh god
[00:31:37.680] 大学朋友圈，我们三个当时处于中间位置，然后我们就突然意识到，天哪
[00:31:42.640]  who do we talk to like what should we do I definitely think there was like a evolution of
[00:31:42.640] 我们应该和谁谈？我们应该做什么？我绝对认为这是一个演变的过程。
[00:31:49.040]  the two groups smashing and I feel like in the beginning it was exactly right it's like
[00:31:49.040] 两组人激烈对抗，我觉得一开始的做法完全正确，就像……
[00:31:53.840]  kind of awkward segregation like some piecemeal conversations here and there but for the most part
[00:31:53.840] 有点像隔阂，偶尔会有一些零星的对话，但大部分时间都是这样。
[00:31:59.040]  it's like two friend groups coexisting and I hang out essentially but there was a couple of things
[00:31:59.040] 感觉就像两个朋友圈共存，我基本上就是和他们一起玩，但还是有几件事发生过。
[00:32:04.320]  that I felt like really helped break through the ice so one was there was an era in our lives
[00:32:04.320] 我觉得这真的有助于打破僵局，所以，首先，我们生活中曾有过一段时期。
[00:32:09.840]  I think like immediately after graduating college where a couple of us were like always foaming
[00:32:09.840] 我觉得就像大学毕业后不久，我们几个总是兴奋得口吐白沫。
[00:32:14.960]  at the mouth to like go out every weekend instead of being like oh guys like this friend group
[00:32:14.960] 嘴上说着“每个周末都出去玩”，而不是像现在这样，哦，伙计们，就像这群朋友一样。
[00:32:21.440]  should hang out and like we should mix friend groups it was like we need to go out this Friday
[00:32:21.440] 应该一起出去玩，也应该让不同朋友的朋友们聚在一起，感觉我们这周五应该出去玩。
[00:32:25.600]  who's available who's down who's down so then we would just spam text everyone yeah but I think once
[00:32:25.600] 谁有空，谁没空，谁没空，然后我们就会给所有人发垃圾信息，对，但我觉得一旦
[00:32:31.040]  we got those like smaller groups going and there was a mission to be accomplished I felt like it
[00:32:31.040] 我们组建了一些小组，感觉好像有什么任务要完成。
[00:32:35.920]  made things a lot more natural and then some sort of like relationships eventually developed
[00:32:35.920] 这让事情变得更加自然，然后最终发展出了一些类似关系。
[00:32:40.720]  and the other thing that I felt like really helped was anytime there was something to like celebrate
[00:32:40.720] 还有一点我觉得特别有帮助，就是每当有值得庆祝的事情发生的时候。
[00:32:46.160]  so when we threw our like joint house forming or had like birthday parties and stuff I felt like
[00:32:46.160] 所以当我们举办联合房屋成立仪式或者生日派对之类的活动时，我觉得
[00:32:51.920]  they were significantly less awkward during those birthday parties if anyone had any sort of like
[00:32:51.920] 如果有人喜欢某种东西，那么在那些生日聚会上，他们的尴尬程度就会大大降低。
[00:32:57.600]  gossip or tea I that really fucking brought the group together yes oh my god I totally agree
[00:32:57.600] 八卦或八卦真的把大家凝聚在一起了，天哪，我完全同意。
[00:33:04.240]  I feel like having some sort of common theme or goal so exactly how you described it would bring
[00:33:04.240] 我觉得如果能有一个共同的主题或目标，就像你描述的那样，就能带来很多好处。
[00:33:11.920]  things together because people would be like oh we're here to like celebrate this person or
[00:33:11.920] 把事情放在一起，因为人们会说，哦，我们来这里是为了庆祝这个人，或者
[00:33:16.400]  you know we're here to have fun because we all wanted to go out versus like oh we're just kind of
[00:33:16.400] 你知道我们来这里是为了玩得开心，因为我们都想出来玩，而不是像……
[00:33:21.760]  hanging out yeah it actually kind of reminds me of recently my friend threw a gallon times and the
[00:33:21.760] 出去玩，嗯，这让我想起了最近我朋友扔了一加仑水的事，还有……
[00:33:28.480]  gallon times was actually like purely mixed friend groups I think there was maybe no more than like two
[00:33:28.480] 《加仑时代》这首歌的演唱会其实就是纯粹的混合朋友聚会，我觉得可能也就两三个朋友吧。
[00:33:34.240]  or three people from like each friend group essentially and most people were kind of like one-off
[00:33:34.240] 或者说，基本上每个朋友圈里就三个人，而且大多数人都是一次性的。
[00:33:38.560]  friends so then it's kind of like a room full of acquaintances last strangers right and then what
[00:33:38.560] 朋友们，然后就像房间里坐满了熟人，最后是陌生人，对吧？然后呢？
[00:33:44.240]  I thought was really smart was one obviously there's theme because it's gallon times everyone was
[00:33:44.240] 我觉得这真的很聪明，显然是有主题的，因为每个人都是加仑的倍数。
[00:33:48.720]  dressed cute and there's like some sort of fun thing to celebrate but I also noticed that my friend
[00:33:48.720] 她打扮得很可爱，好像有什么好玩的事情要庆祝，但我同时也注意到我的朋友
[00:33:53.600]  was intentionally giving everyone a job or would like pair people to a job so she's like okay you
[00:33:53.600] 她故意给每个人都安排工作，或者想把人配对，所以她就说，好吧，你
[00:33:58.560]  too come here and build this Shakur to report or like can you guys help me set this table up and by
[00:33:58.560] 也来这里搭建这个 Shakur 来汇报，或者你们能帮我设置一下这个表格吗？
[00:34:04.320]  doing that I felt like there's a specific mission and like an activity and you're like paired up with
[00:34:04.320] 这样做的时候，我觉得就像是执行一项特定的任务，或者参与一项活动，然后你会和别人一组。
[00:34:09.920]  people but it's not forced to be like oh meet my friend and become festies right away yeah so then
[00:34:09.920] 人与人之间并非一定要像“哦，认识我的朋友，然后马上成为音乐节的伙伴”那样，所以……
[00:34:14.720]  I felt like that also made it a lot more natural yeah kind of like the going out everyone's
[00:34:14.720] 我觉得那样也让一切变得更自然了，就像大家一起出去玩一样。
[00:34:18.800]  working towards something together I feel like a big part of the success of mixing friend groups is
[00:34:18.800] 我觉得，朋友群体融合成功的关键在于大家共同努力，朝着某个目标前进。
[00:34:25.840]  all these activities just work towards allowing people to be comfortable with showing who they
[00:34:25.840] 所有这些活动都旨在让人们能够自在地展现真实的自我。
[00:34:31.200]  really are to people they're not as familiar with and I think once that's really shown is when people
[00:34:31.200] 对于不太熟悉的人来说，情况确实如此，我认为一旦这一点真正展现出来，人们就会……
[00:34:38.480]  really start getting along with each other and being really comfortable with each other it falls in
[00:34:38.480] 当他们真正开始相处融洽，彼此感到非常自在时，事情就顺理成章了。
[00:34:42.960]  line with what I'm sensing is kind of a theme here that it's like people will unite under like a
[00:34:42.960] 这与我感觉到的一个主题相符，那就是人们会团结在某种……之下。
[00:34:49.200]  similar thing whether that be like a goal a person an event whatever you know how we said a wedding
[00:34:49.200] 类似的事情，无论是目标、人、事件，还是其他什么，比如我们刚才说的婚礼。
[00:34:57.600]  is like kind of the ultimate friend mixer but that's like you know such a common theme I guess it's
[00:34:57.600] 这就像是朋友聚会的终极盛会，但你知道，这好像是个很常见的主题。
[00:35:03.840]  like over here to celebrate this couple's love so everyone's like oh my god I'm so happy to be here
[00:35:03.840] 就像在这里庆祝这对新人的爱情一样，所以每个人都说，哦我的天哪，我真高兴能来到这里。
[00:35:10.480]  and I expect to meet new people as well so it usually always works out and I guess like
[00:35:10.480] 而且我也期待能认识新朋友，所以通常都会很顺利，我想就像
[00:35:17.360]  it's easier to find that common ground to like start a conversation on as well because you know
[00:35:17.360] 这样更容易找到共同话题，从而开启对话，因为你知道
[00:35:24.480]  like the biggest question or the easiest question to ask at a wedding is like oh do you know the
[00:35:24.480] 比如，婚礼上最容易问的问题或最关键的问题就是：你知道吗？
[00:35:29.280]  group like are you from the groom side or the bride side and then from there like everything goes on
[00:35:29.280] 比如，你是新郎那边的还是新娘那边的，然后一切就顺理成章地展开了。
[00:35:34.880]  I feel like my takeaway from this entire conversation is that we need a rebrand every hangout
[00:35:34.880] 我觉得从这次谈话中我最大的收获是，我们需要对每个聚会场所进行品牌重塑。
[00:35:40.000]  as a celebration of something something everyone every time we hang out there's like some sort of
[00:35:40.000] 为了庆祝某件事，每次我们聚在一起，都会有某种……
[00:35:45.120]  thing we're trying to celebrate and that's our main goal yeah because I feel like even if it were
[00:35:45.120] 我们正在努力庆祝的事情，这也是我们的主要目标，因为我觉得即使它是
[00:35:49.360]  something simple like oh my god let's get together and like binge this tv show I think everyone who
[00:35:49.360] 比如，像“我的天哪，我们聚在一起，一起追这部剧吧”，我觉得每个人都会这么想。
[00:35:55.760]  goes has that common interest already like oh my god I'm so excited to see like what's gonna
[00:35:55.760] goes已经拥有了共同的兴趣，天哪，我太兴奋了，想看看接下来会发生什么。
[00:35:59.920]  happen next even if they don't know each other the bond over like oh my god I hate this character
[00:35:59.920] 接下来发生的事情，即使他们互不相识，也会像“我的天哪，我讨厌这个角色”那样，建立起深厚的感情。
[00:36:04.480]  or like oh my god I'm rooting for this character this is a slight pivot but I was thinking about
[00:36:04.480] 或者就像，我的天哪，我太支持这个角色了！这有点跑题，但我一直在想……
[00:36:08.960]  this earlier have you guys ever been in situations where you have like maybe a singular friend
[00:36:08.960] 之前你们有没有遇到过这种情况：只有一个朋友
[00:36:13.920]  or like a small group of friends that you just don't really want to introduce to your larger group
[00:36:13.920] 或者就像一小群你不太想介绍给你的大家庭的朋友。
[00:36:20.240]  but that you be nervous about I don't know how to word this I guess like friend groups that
[00:36:20.240] 但你可能会为此感到紧张，我不知道该怎么表达，我想大概就像朋友群体那样吧。
[00:36:23.840]  you're trying not to mix right yeah I guess yeah I guess so yeah I can definitely relate to that
[00:36:23.840] 你尽量避免混在一起，对吧？嗯，我猜是吧？嗯，我猜是吧？嗯，我完全能理解。
[00:36:30.000]  I feel like it's natural like sometimes you have fun groups that
[00:36:30.000] 我觉得这很自然，就像有时候你会遇到一些有趣的团体一样。
[00:36:34.240]  mix more or like mesh better and then sometimes there's fun groups that you want to maybe keep
[00:36:34.240] 多加混合，或者说更好地融合，有时也会有一些有趣的组合，你可能想保留它们。
[00:36:39.120]  more private or like you prefer them to be kind of like exclusive to you and that friend group only
[00:36:39.120] 更注重隐私，或者你更喜欢只对你和你的朋友圈开放。
[00:36:45.680]  and I feel like that's natural but the only difficult thing for me is I don't know how to articulate
[00:36:45.680] 我觉得这很自然，但对我来说唯一的困难是我不知道该如何表达。
[00:36:51.120]  that and sometimes it's something that I kind of wonder like am I a shitty friend or am I a
[00:36:51.120] 有时候我会想，我是不是个糟糕的朋友，或者我是不是个……
[00:36:55.680]  shitty person for not wanting to mix this friend group with other friends for example nah I don't
[00:36:55.680] 这个人真糟糕，居然不愿意让这群朋友和其他朋友混在一起，比如，不，我才不这么认为呢。
[00:37:00.320]  think you're shitty but it's like I don't know it's something that I grapple with to the point
[00:37:00.320] 我觉得你很糟糕，但我不知道为什么，这个问题我一直纠结到极点。
[00:37:06.960]  where I've like brought it up to my therapist before and I was like is it wrong that I mix friend
[00:37:06.960] 我之前跟我的心理咨询师提过这件事，我说我跟朋友混在一起是不是错了？
[00:37:12.160]  group a bc but not friend group d and she was like why would that be wrong you're just setting up
[00:37:12.160] 她加入了A组BC，但没加入D组，她就问，这有什么错？你只是在安排而已。
[00:37:19.600]  each friend group for success in the way that you understand that friend group so you don't have
[00:37:19.600] 每个朋友群体要想成功，关键在于你如何理解这个朋友群体，这样你就不会有……
[00:37:24.560]  to feel guilty about it that's just how you feel and she was like also there's no obligation to
[00:37:24.560] 为此感到内疚，这只是你的个人感受，她还说，你也没有义务……
[00:37:28.640]  mix friend groups and I was like whoa you're like wait what yeah oh my the immediate thought I had
[00:37:28.640] 混杂着几个朋友，我当时就想，哇，你……等等，什么？是啊，哦，我的天，我当时的第一反应就是……
[00:37:37.680]  when this question was posed I think it's very reasonable especially if like maybe a friend group
[00:37:37.680] 我觉得这个问题提出来很合理，尤其如果是朋友之间的讨论的话。
[00:37:42.960]  is very niche for example say you and this friend group are really into like pottery or something
[00:37:42.960] 例如，这非常小众，假设你和你的朋友们都非常喜欢陶艺之类的东西。
[00:37:50.000]  and then like literally no one else cares about pottery in like your other friend group you know
[00:37:50.000] 然后，你知道吗，你其他的朋友圈里好像根本没人对陶艺感兴趣。
[00:37:56.080]  or maybe like they're not into it the way that like you and that other friend group is so they just
[00:37:56.080] 或许他们不像你和其他朋友那样热衷于此，所以他们就……
[00:38:01.440]  like wouldn't mix because it's like oh well when I hang out with this group all we do is like
[00:38:01.440] 感觉不太搭，因为就像，哦，我和这群人出去玩的时候，我们只会做这些事……
[00:38:06.320]  make pottery and talk about pottery but then when I hang out with this other group like all we do
[00:38:06.320] 做陶器，聊陶器，但当我跟另一群人出去玩的时候，我们只会做这些事。
[00:38:10.960]  is like drink and gossip you know like it just wouldn't work so I feel like there's definitely
[00:38:10.960] 就像边喝酒边八卦，你知道，那样根本行不通，所以我感觉肯定不行。
[00:38:15.600]  no fault in that I never really thought about it like that also pottery sounds hell of fun
[00:38:15.600] 这没什么错，我之前从来没那样想过。而且陶艺听起来也超级好玩。
[00:38:22.320]  have you guys done it before no I actually haven't so hard is it we should give a try sometime
[00:38:22.320] 你们以前做过吗？没有，我其实没做过，所以很难吗？我们应该找个时间试试。
[00:38:31.040]  I think also age gaps another thing I'm thinking of is like work friends maybe like sometimes
[00:38:31.040] 我觉得年龄差距也是个问题，还有一点我想到的是，比如工作上的朋友，有时候……
[00:38:37.120]  it might be hard to mix work friends with your childhood friends just because it's like you
[00:38:37.120] 把工作上的朋友和儿时的朋友混为一谈可能很难，因为这就像你一样。
[00:38:42.640]  would be showing them like a degenerate side of you when you're like okay they need to keep the
[00:38:42.640] 这就像向他们展示你堕落的一面，而你却觉得好吧，他们需要保留……
[00:38:46.960]  like professional adult me in their mind I think as much as I'd like to think that I interact with
[00:38:46.960] 就像他们心目中的职业成年人一样，我想，尽管我更愿意这样认为，但我与他们的互动方式却截然不同。
[00:38:53.760]  my work friends like how I interact with my other friends there's definitely like a level of
[00:38:53.760] 我的同事朋友们喜欢我和其他朋友的互动方式，这其中肯定存在某种程度的……
[00:38:58.480]  reservation yeah and like I'm holding myself back in a sense of like I'm not really gonna show
[00:38:58.480] 预订是啊，感觉我有点克制自己，好像我真的不想露面似的。
[00:39:05.040]  them like all the sides of me because at the end of the day work is work yeah I think it's a very
[00:39:05.040] 他们喜欢我的所有方面，因为归根结底，工作就是工作，是的，我认为这非常
[00:39:10.240]  interesting concept to think about and it's something that I thought about a lot last year actually
[00:39:10.240] 这个想法很有意思，值得思考，实际上去年我也一直在思考这个问题。
[00:39:14.480]  with like the vacherate party and whatnot and the wedding and making tables and all of this like
[00:39:14.480] 比如聚会、婚礼、布置餐桌等等等等。
[00:39:19.440]  thought that goes behind like curating exactly who socializes with who and whatnot I think for
[00:39:19.440] 我觉得，这背后涉及到精心策划社交对象和其他各种事情。
[00:39:25.440]  thought that helped me the most was I have a lot of friends that I love but I don't want to meet
[00:39:25.440] 对我帮助最大的一点是，我有很多我爱的朋友，但我不想见面。
[00:39:31.120]  all of their friends and I don't want to always be hanging out with them plus all of their friends
[00:39:31.120] 他们的朋友们，我不想总是和他们以及他们的朋友们待在一起。
[00:39:35.600]  so then it made me kind of put down that guilt of like oh am I not mixing this friend or like
[00:39:35.600] 所以，这让我放下了那种愧疚感，比如“哦，我是不是没和这位朋友搞好关系”之类的。
[00:39:41.680]  this friend group enough into my life because there's nothing wrong with like keeping people separate
[00:39:41.680] 这个朋友圈已经足够融入我的生活了，因为保持人与人之间的距离并没有什么错。
[00:39:47.280]  like your therapist said you just you know you're just setting all the friend groups up for success
[00:39:47.280] 就像你的治疗师说的那样，你知道你只是在为所有朋友圈的成功铺路。
[00:39:51.920]  yeah well I have a final question for all of us do you think among all of this there's like
[00:39:51.920] 嗯，我最后一个问题想问问大家，你们觉得在所有这些事情中，有没有……
[00:39:59.520]  maybe like etiquette rules or like things to keep in mind overall
[00:39:59.520] 或许是礼仪规则，或者其他需要注意的事项。
[00:40:04.560]  I think one big thing I don't know if this is like etiquette or a rule but more of something to keep
[00:40:04.560] 我觉得有一件很重要的事，我不知道这算不算礼仪或规则，但更像是一种需要遵守的准则。
[00:40:11.360]  in mind it's like when you're mixing friend groups you also want to consider how your friends would
[00:40:11.360] 记住，这就像你把不同的朋友群体混在一起时，你也需要考虑你的朋友们会怎么想。
[00:40:16.400]  feel in that environment because as exciting as it is for you because you know everyone there
[00:40:16.400] 身处那种环境会让你感到兴奋，因为你认识那里的每一个人。
[00:40:20.560]  everyone has a different personality some people are more extroverted some people are more
[00:40:20.560] 每个人的性格都不同，有些人比较外向，有些人比较内向。
[00:40:24.000]  introverted even if you think everyone's gonna get along just fine it's like some people when
[00:40:24.000] 即使你认为每个人都会相处融洽，但内向的人也会像有些人一样……
[00:40:29.200]  they're put in situations where there's like a lot of people they don't know if they get like
[00:40:29.200] 他们被置于一种有很多陌生人的环境中，如果他们遇到这种情况……
[00:40:33.360]  way more anxious and they just won't end up having a good time so you always have to think about
[00:40:33.360] 他们会更加焦虑，最终可能玩得不开心，所以你总是要考虑到这一点。
[00:40:38.720]  how that person is socially as like a baseline not how they interact with you but how they are
[00:40:38.720] 这个人社交能力的基准，不是他们如何与你互动，而是他们如何……
[00:40:43.440]  generally it's a good one yeah I think my final etiquette thought is probably similar to that it's
[00:40:43.440] 总的来说，这确实是个好主意。是的，我想我最后关于礼仪的想法可能也和这个类似。
[00:40:49.120]  like know the vibe of the event don't overexert people's social abilities essentially
[00:40:49.120] 比如了解活动的氛围，不要过度消耗人们的社交能力。
[00:40:56.560]  so I feel like some things are sacred like reunions maybe don't mix friend groups there
[00:40:56.560] 所以我觉得有些事情是神圣不可侵犯的，比如同学聚会，也许不应该让不同的朋友群体混在一起。
[00:41:01.840]  you're just like really truly setting up your plus one for like a shitty night basically
[00:41:01.840] 你这简直就是在故意让你的伴侣度过一个糟糕的夜晚。
[00:41:06.880]  birthday parties maybe don't bring plus ones or like mixed friend groups there if you're the guest
[00:41:06.880] 如果你是客人，生日派对可能不建议带伴侣或混杂的朋友参加。
[00:41:12.800]  and if you are part of the friend group being mixed then just try to come with the vibe try to be
[00:41:12.800] 如果你所在的友人圈子是多元文化的，那就尽量融入其中，努力成为其中的一员。
[00:41:18.160]  open-minded and maybe you'll meet a friend who you like better than the friend who introduced you
[00:41:18.160] 保持开放的心态，或许你会遇到一个比介绍你认识的那位朋友更喜欢的朋友。
[00:41:23.360]  take care okay yeah I think you two summed it up really well thank you Jonathan for joining us this
[00:41:23.360] 保重，好的。嗯，我觉得你们俩总结得很好。谢谢乔纳森加入我们。
[00:41:30.800]  week to chat about mixing friend groups I think it uncovered a lot more nuance behind it than maybe
[00:41:30.800] 花了一周时间讨论朋友圈混杂的问题，我觉得它揭示了其中许多微妙之处，可能比我想象的要多得多。
[00:41:37.040]  you initially expected so I think it was a productive conversation and for our listeners out there
[00:41:37.040] 所以我觉得这次谈话很有成效，也符合我们最初的预期，对于我们的听众来说也是如此。
