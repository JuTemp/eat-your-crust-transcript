[00:00:00.160] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Jeffrey. So today we have on a brand new guest. He is our friend Jeffrey and he will be joining us today to talk about dealing with stagnation in our daily lives and discussing what has
[00:00:00.160] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo，我是Jeffrey。今天我们请到了一位全新的嘉宾，他就是我们的老朋友Jeffrey。今天他将和我们一起探讨如何应对日常生活中的停滞不前，以及……
[00:00:27.180] really inspired change for us recently. But before we dive into that topic, Crystal, what's our Gen Z word this week? So remember how we mentioned that Gen Z doesn't really love acronyms? Right. So I brought a funny acronym because it's so
[00:00:27.180] 最近这件事真的激励我们做出改变。不过在深入探讨这个话题之前，Crystal，我们这周的Z世代关键词是什么？还记得我们说过Z世代不太喜欢缩写吗？没错。所以我带来了一个有趣的缩写，因为它……
[00:00:46.740] outrageous that I'm not even sure if it's truly Gen Z slang, but I think it is. IJBOL. Which is basically I J B O L. And it stands for I just burst out laughing. And my theory on this
[00:00:46.740] 太离谱了，我甚至都不确定这算不算Z世代俚语，但我觉得是。IJBOL。基本上就是I J B O L。意思是“我刚刚爆笑了”。我对这个的解释是……
[00:01:04.620] word actually is that it might be like almost a fake slang word. I think a lot of Gen Z actually don't use it, but it's been floating around. I don't know, maybe it just like hasn't gone as viral. But it was funny because this one streamer that I
[00:01:04.620] 实际上，这个词可能有点像个伪俚语。我觉得很多Z世代其实都不用它，但它一直在流传。我也不知道，也许只是还没火起来。不过挺搞笑的，因为有个主播……
[00:01:21.380] sometimes see on TikTok, he had like a clip where someone in his chat taught him like, Oh, do you know what IJBOL is? Like, this is what IJBOL is like, don't be a boomer. He's like, okay. And
[00:01:21.380] 有时在TikTok上看到他，有个视频片段，聊天室里有人教他，说：“你知道IJBOL是什么吗？IJBOL是这样的，别那么老古董。” 他回答说：“好的。”
[00:01:32.060] then a few days later, he he's in a game and he meets some random like Gen Z-er and he's like, Oh, do you know IJBOL? And she's like, No, what the fuck is that? He's like, your age is showing and she was like, that's kind of mean.
[00:01:32.060] 几天后，他在玩游戏时遇到一个陌生人，看起来像是Z世代的女孩，他就问她：“哦，你知道IJBOL吗？”女孩说：“不知道，那是什么鬼？”他说：“你这暴露年龄了。”女孩说：“你这话有点刻薄。”
[00:01:46.060] Dude, I upon hearing that I'm like, is this how the boomers felt when they discover what LOL is? Dude, but I feel like I agree with you, Crystal, that I don't think this is a real word. Because the only times I've ever
[00:01:46.060] 老兄，我听到这话的时候就想，婴儿潮一代发现“LOL”这个词的时候是不是也是这种感觉？老兄，不过我觉得我同意你的看法，Crystal，我觉得这根本不是个词。因为我唯一几次听到这个词的时候……
[00:01:59.740] heard this phrase is when people use it to shame other people of like, oh, you don't keep up with the latest Gen Z slang. Like I heard this on, I've been obsessed with the Trisha Paytas podcast recently. I've been like binging all the fucking
[00:01:59.740] 我听说这句话是用来羞辱别人的，比如，哦，你跟不上Z世代的最新俚语。我是在Trisha Paytas的播客里听到这句话的，我最近迷上了她的播客。我一直在疯狂地听她的节目。
[00:02:12.780] episodes and then the co host was telling Trisha like, Oh, no one says LOL anymore. People only say IJBOL but I've never seen it or heard it out in the wild. Dude, same. It's gotta be some sort of conspiracy. Yeah.
[00:02:12.780] 节目里，主持人跟Trisha说：“哦，现在没人说LOL了。大家都说IJBOL，但我从来没见过也没听过。” 哥们儿，我也是。这肯定是什么阴谋。没错。
[00:02:27.620] Dude, the boomers are just trying to out all the boomers. That's what it really is. But if you do Google it, the first article that pops up is like a New York Times article and it says IJBOL is in LOL is out.
[00:02:27.620] 老兄，婴儿潮一代就是想把他们自己都淘汰出局。事情就是这样。但如果你用谷歌搜一下，跳出来的第一篇文章好像是《纽约时报》的，上面说IJBOL还在，LOL出局了。
[00:02:41.980] Oh my god. But lowkey, do Gen Z even laugh? Like, I feel like the way they express laughter on TikTok comments is the skull emoji or the crying emoji. They never even say la mal or LOL. So I feel like they don't laugh. That's a really good point.
[00:02:41.980] 我的天哪。不过说真的，Z世代真的会笑吗？感觉他们在TikTok评论里表达笑的方式要么是骷髅头表情，要么是哭泣表情。他们从来不说“哈哈”或者“哈哈”。所以我觉得他们根本不会笑。你说的很有道理。
[00:02:59.140] Dude, are Gen Z kids just not happy? That's so sad. It's also funny because I feel like every time I read anything that's like very Gen Z, a comment or something, I'm always reading it in like some sort of sarcastic tone. True.
[00:02:59.140] 老兄，Z世代的孩子们是不是都不快乐啊？太让人难过了。还有点搞笑的是，我觉得每次我读到一些很有Z世代特色的东西，比如评论什么的，我都会觉得语气里带着讽刺。确实如此。
[00:03:16.260] Even if it's like them laughing, like the skull emoji, I read that in my head, like sarcastically. If that makes sense. It totally does. I think it is kind of tongue in cheek, maybe maybe not the full sarcasm, but it's just like a little bit more
[00:03:16.260] 就算他们只是在笑，就像那个骷髅表情一样，我脑子里想的也是讽刺的那种感觉。不知道你能不能理解。完全可以。我觉得这有点半开玩笑的意思，也许不是完全的讽刺，但就是有点儿……
[00:03:34.220] playful than just a pure laughter. Like LOL to me is like pure laughing, especially when they string LOL in like all caps. I feel like you know, they're actually laughing their ass off. But skull emoji is like, you know, I wouldn't expect them to be laughing. Mm hmm.
[00:03:34.220] 比单纯的笑声更有戏谑意味。对我来说，LOL 就跟纯粹的笑声一样，尤其是当他们用全大写字母连写 LOL 的时候。我觉得，你知道，他们是真的在开怀大笑。但骷髅头表情就不一样了，你知道，我不会觉得他们是在笑。嗯哼。
[00:03:48.820] Yeah, I don't know. Every time I see the skull emoji, I just think of people saying like, oh, I'm dead. Like that was so funny. I wonder if that's maybe how the skull emoji like originated.
[00:03:48.820] 是啊，我也不知道。每次看到骷髅头表情符号，我就会想到人们说“哦，我死了”之类的话。这真的太搞笑了。我怀疑骷髅头表情符号是不是就是这么来的。
[00:03:57.740] Yeah, I don't know if itchable is gonna be a word that I'll be able to incorporate. Like what if it's like you said, like a trap? It's entrapment. So people know that when you say itchable
[00:03:57.740] 是啊，我不知道“itchable”这个词能不能用进去。就像你说的，万一它像个陷阱呢？它其实是“entrapment”（诱捕）的意思。这样一来，人们一听到“itchable”这个词就知道了。
[00:04:07.980] that you fell for like the Gen Z. Oh, this is like the latest Gen Z thing. And then that's how they know you're a boomer. Honestly, I could believe it. They're like, yo, let's spread this random ass thing. Yeah. To see who the real boomers are.
[00:04:07.980] 你居然像Z世代那样被忽悠了。哦，这可是Z世代最新的潮流啊。然后他们就用这个来判断你是老古董了。说真的，我信。他们会说，嘿，咱们把这乱七八糟的东西传播出去吧。是啊。看看谁才是真正的老古董。
[00:04:21.500] Also, it like doesn't roll off the tongue. Yeah. LOL. That's like pretty, you know, solid. You can spell it out. Some people read it like lol. That's also totally fine. But itchable? Like if I were to spell it out, IJBOL. Itchable? You know, it sounds so wrong.
[00:04:21.500] 而且，这词念起来也不顺口。是啊。哈哈。这词挺……嗯，挺靠谱的。你可以把它拼出来。有些人读起来像“lol”。这样也完全没问题。但是“itchable”呢？如果我把它拼出来，IJBOL。“Itchable”？你知道，听起来怪怪的。
[00:04:39.220] Yeah, it sounds like ethnic kind of. Dude, somebody should cancel the Gen Z kids. I think I will stick to LOL. In my eyes, LOL is superior to itchable. Agreed. All right. Well, enough about how to properly laugh on the
[00:04:39.220] 是啊，听起来有点像民族风。老兄，真该有人把Z世代的孩子们都赶走。我觉得我还是坚持用LOL吧。在我看来，LOL比痒痒的强多了。同意。好吧。好了，关于怎么正确地大笑就说到这儿吧。
[00:04:58.220] internet. Let's talk about the topic at hand, which Jisoo mentioned earlier. What kind of inspires change in your life? To start us off, I have a question for all of us. What do you feel like is maybe a sign that you recognize where you're
[00:04:58.220] 互联网。我们来聊聊Jisoo之前提到的那个话题。什么会激发你生活中的改变？首先，我想问大家一个问题。你觉得什么样的迹象表明你意识到自己身处何处？
[00:05:16.740] like, I think something needs to change? So I think this can start in a either really mundane way or a really exaggerated way. So I think on like one end of the spectrum is like, let's say you lose your job and your entire
[00:05:16.740] 我觉得，有些事情需要改变。所以，我认为这可以以一种非常平凡的方式开始，也可以以一种非常夸张的方式开始。比如说，在极端情况下，假设你失去了工作，失去了所有的一切。
[00:05:31.900] life gets upended. That's a pretty big deal. Yeah, I think that's a pretty clear indicator that something needs to change, right? But I think in our day to day lives, like, usually something like drastic doesn't happen. So I
[00:05:31.900] 生活天翻地覆。这可是件大事。是啊，我觉得这很明显地表明需要做出改变，对吧？但我觉得在我们的日常生活中，通常不会发生这么剧烈的变化。所以……
[00:05:46.540] think it's when you feel really comfortable in your life where you feel like you have a day to day routine, you're doing kind of the same thing every day. And when given the option of spicing things up, you don't really take that. That sort of
[00:05:46.540] 我觉得当你生活非常舒适，每天都按部就班，做着差不多的事情时，就会出现这种情况。即使有机会让生活更有趣，你也不会真的去尝试。就是那种……
[00:06:00.980] been something that I have noticed in my life where I'm like, oh, like I'm not really growing in any particular aspect. And I can see that I'm kind of just coasting by day to day and kind of just turning my brain off.
[00:06:00.980] 我注意到自己生活中出现了一种现象，感觉自己在任何方面都没有真正成长。我发现自己只是日复一日地混日子，大脑也几乎处于关闭状态。
[00:06:12.660] I feel like I can relate to that too. It's kind of like, the days start to blend together before you know it a month or so has passed and you think to yourself, what have I been doing for the past, you know, month or whatever?
[00:06:12.660] 我感觉自己也能感同身受。就是那种感觉，日子一天天过去，不知不觉一个月左右就过去了，你会想，过去这一个月我都在干嘛呢？
[00:06:24.860] Yeah, it like is really apparent to me when people ask me like, Oh, like, how are you doing? Like, what have you been up to? And I just like stop and think for a second. I'm like, I don't know. All of my days have blended together. I've done
[00:06:24.860] 是啊，当别人问我“你好吗？最近在忙什么？”的时候，我就会特别明显地感觉到。然后我会停下来想一会儿，然后说：“我不知道。我的日子都混在一起了。”
[00:06:34.780] like the same thing for the past month. What have I been up to? That's kind of interesting, because I can definitely see how that could be a sign that you need change in your life. But I think in my life, it manifests slightly differently. So I would
[00:06:34.780] 过去一个月我都过着同样的日子。我到底在忙些什么呢？这挺有意思的，因为我完全能理解这可能意味着你需要改变。但我觉得在我身上，它的表现形式略有不同。所以，我会
[00:06:50.020] say that I know I need to change something when I keep searching for something that's like more stimulating sort of. And that's not to say it's like always going to be a specific lifestyle or like a party or something like that. But you know, it's
[00:06:50.020] 我知道自己需要做出一些改变，因为我一直在寻找一些更能刺激我的东西。这并不是说一定要改变生活方式，或者参加派对之类的。但是，你知道，就是这样。
[00:07:07.100] like I feel like there's an outburst kind of waiting to happen under and then that's when I'm like, okay, something's like wrong. So that was probably something that made me start therapy, where I was kind of like, Okay, you know, my life is
[00:07:07.100] 感觉就像内心深处有个声音在酝酿，随时可能爆发，然后我就意识到，好吧，肯定出问题了。所以，这大概就是我开始接受心理治疗的原因吧，在治疗过程中，我意识到，好吧，你知道，我的生活……
[00:07:20.740] fun. Like, I can't say that I'm not having a fun time. Or I can't say that I'm not busy, but I'm just waiting for something to happen or like burst, which is not very good. So like, to me,
[00:07:20.740] 有趣。嗯，我不能说我过得不开心。或者说我也不闲着，但我只是在等待什么事情发生，或者像爆发一样，这不太好。所以，对我来说，
[00:07:31.860] that's the way that it shows up as like, something's bubbling under the surface. And I should probably get that taken care of. Is it like, like repressed energy? I need to release my zoomies somehow. Yeah, or it's like, I think you can artificially make your life
[00:07:31.860] 就是这样，感觉就像有什么东西在水面下涌动。我应该把它处理好。是不是像压抑的能量？我需要找个地方释放一下我的精力。嗯，或者说，我觉得你可以人为地创造你的生活。
[00:07:49.900] feel and seem very fun if you like constantly stack your schedule. But that doesn't mean you're always sorting through the things that you need to sort through. And I think for me, like, that's what something that I default to. And I don't
[00:07:49.900] 如果你喜欢不断地把日程安排得满满当当，那感觉和看起来会很有趣。但这并不意味着你总是在忙着处理那些需要处理的事情。我觉得对我来说，这就像是我默认的状态。而且我并不
[00:08:01.860] always have time to like sit down and go through my emotions. So, you know, I could talk about all these things that I've done, but really, the important thing that I should be getting to hasn't been done, which is why I need change.
[00:08:01.860] 我总是有时间坐下来好好梳理自己的情绪。所以，你知道，我可以谈谈我做过的所有事情，但实际上，我真正应该着手的重要事情还没有完成，这就是为什么我需要改变。
[00:08:16.100] I have a funny sign because it's very like, outward facing or like physical, I guess versus like an internal feeling. But if my room is like really messy, it means that like, my life is really chaotic or like, not put together right now. And to me,
[00:08:16.100] 我有个挺有意思的标志，因为它很外在，或者说是物质层面的，跟内在感受不太一样。如果我的房间特别乱，那就说明我的生活现在很混乱，或者说一团糟。对我来说，
[00:08:33.900] that means that maybe I'm either overdoing it in some way, or I'm not stimulated enough so that I don't, you know, do these things to like keep my life orderly, I guess. So my room is almost like a reflection of my mind, in a sense, where if it's
[00:08:33.900] 这意味着也许我在某些方面做得过头了，或者我缺乏足够的刺激，以至于我无法去做一些事情来维持生活的秩序。所以从某种意义上说，我的房间几乎就像我内心世界的一面镜子，如果它……
[00:08:52.340] organized and good, that means I'm probably in a pretty good space where I have time to do everything that I want to do. But if it's messy, then yeah, like maybe there's like too much going on, I'm not getting to have enough, like alone time mixed
[00:08:52.340] 井井有条、一切顺利，那就意味着我目前的状态相当不错，有时间做所有我想做的事情。但如果一团糟，那就说明可能事情太多，我没有足够的独处时间。
[00:09:09.860] with like, you know, other things. So then that is kind of a more physical sign for maybe not like super big change, but more like life adjustment, rebalancing kind of. Ooh, that's a good one. Yeah, I definitely just took a look at my room as you said that
[00:09:09.860] 就像，你知道，还有其他一些事情。所以，这算是一种更实际的迹象，可能不是什么翻天覆地的变化，而更像是生活方式的调整，某种程度上的重新平衡。哦，这个比喻很贴切。是啊，就像你说的，我刚才确实看了看我的房间。
[00:09:25.500] and I was like, ooh, that's a good point. I think especially as people who use like utilize their bedroom space a lot, whether it's for work or just to chill and hang out, it often is a reflection of their mind state to see like, how organized are
[00:09:25.500] 我当时就想，哦，这说得有道理。我觉得尤其对于那些经常使用卧室空间的人来说，无论是工作还是休闲放松，卧室的整洁程度往往能反映出他们的精神状态。
[00:09:42.460] things? Is there sort of a method to the chaos if it is slightly messy, versus like some people who just like don't really care and leave their room messy all the time, right? And yeah, for them, I think they have like so many other things
[00:09:42.460] 东西？如果房间稍微有点乱，那混乱中是不是也蕴含着某种规律？不像有些人，根本不在乎，房间总是乱糟糟的，对吧？嗯，我觉得他们有很多其他的事情要做。
[00:09:53.980] going on. They don't even think about their room. And I imagine like for people who are homeowners, it would be kind of like the state of your home. Like is your home acceptable for someone to walk in and hang out with you for a
[00:09:53.980] 他们忙着自己的事，根本没想过自己的房间。我想对于房主来说，这就好比是审视自己的家。比如，你的家是否适合别人进来待上一段时间。
[00:10:05.100] bit? Or is it not? And then that's like kind of a reflection as well. It's true. I think it's also kind of chicken or the egg ish where I feel like sometimes I just set myself up for failure
[00:10:05.100] 是吗？还是不是？这其实也算是一种反思。确实如此。我觉得这有点像是先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题，有时候我觉得我只是在给自己挖坑，让自己更容易失败。
[00:10:16.380] when my house or like my room isn't clean. Like I can take one glance at my desk and know if I'm gonna have a good week or a bad week, which my desk is usually messy. So maybe that's
[00:10:16.380] 当我的房子或者房间不干净的时候，我就会感觉很糟糕。比如，我只要看一眼我的桌子，就能知道接下来一周是好是坏，而我的桌子通常都很乱。所以，也许这就是原因吧。
[00:10:26.340] a bad sign. But I do think it's interesting that you talk a little bit about like the physical manifestations of needing change. Because I think sometimes if I notice myself wanting to isolate a lot, or if I'm starting to like lash out a
[00:10:26.340] 这是个不好的迹象。但我确实觉得你谈到需要改变的生理表现很有意思。因为我觉得有时候如果我发现自己很想把自己封闭起来，或者开始发脾气……
[00:10:41.540] little bit randomly, just like emotionally, then I know like something needs to happen. Or this one is kind of bad. But if I'm like texting or calling my mom a lot, like significantly more than usual, then I know like something is deeply wrong.
[00:10:41.540] 有时候，我会莫名其妙地，像情绪波动那样，感觉到什么事要发生了。或者感觉情况不太妙。但如果我频繁地给妈妈发短信或打电话，比平时频繁得多，那我就知道肯定出了大问题。
[00:10:59.220] I think that makes a lot of sense, though, because then you're trying to like lean on the most comfortable thing. So that would probably or for you, that's like family, parents, stuff like that. So it's like, why do I feel the need to reach back to my
[00:10:59.220] 我觉得这很有道理，因为那样你就会想依靠最舒服的东西。对你来说，那可能就是家人、父母之类的。所以问题就变成了，为什么我会觉得需要回到我身边？
[00:11:13.460] most comfortable state? Right? Yeah, it's interesting that you say that because something that sort of drove me to seek therapy a few years ago, was I felt like I was in this constant state of like, blah. The real word to
[00:11:13.460] 最舒服的状态？对吧？嗯，你说得很有意思，因为几年前促使我去接受心理治疗的原因之一，就是我感觉自己一直处于一种……嗯……的状态。
[00:11:29.140] describe that is languishing. And it's just kind of where you're in a state of constant, like you don't really care about much. And I was starting to realize that I felt this way when I was going out to like social gatherings or parties, and I was
[00:11:29.140] 形容那种萎靡不振的状态。就好像你一直处于一种漠不关心的状态，对什么都提不起兴趣。我开始意识到，当我参加社交聚会或派对时，我就会感到这种状态，而且我当时……
[00:11:42.420] hanging out with people. And I didn't really feel happy or enjoyment or really anything when I was with people. And I was starting to ask myself, what's going on? Like, why? Why do I feel this way? Why am I not happy hanging out with my
[00:11:42.420] 和朋友们一起玩。但我和他们在一起的时候，并没有感到快乐、享受，或者其他任何快乐。我开始问自己，这是怎么回事？为什么？为什么我会这样？为什么和朋友们在一起我也不开心？
[00:11:56.820] friends? I think my therapist did a really good job of uncovering sort of not only what was driving some of those feelings, but more of the underlying causes. And they're really, really good at making you dig into your childhood to see
[00:11:56.820] 朋友？我觉得我的治疗师做得很好，他不仅揭示了某些情绪的根源，还挖掘出了更深层次的原因。他们真的很擅长引导你深入挖掘童年经历。
[00:12:08.980] like what sort of trauma brought you to this state. Classic therapist asking about your childhood. All of our problems really do stem from childhood. It's kind of crazy. I actually wonder if we're changing truly that much
[00:12:08.980] 比如，究竟是什么样的创伤让你变成现在这样？典型的心理治疗师会问你的童年经历。我们所有的问题其实都源于童年。这有点不可思议。我甚至怀疑我们真的有那么大的改变吗？
[00:12:24.500] emotionally in our like mid 20s, or if now we just are a little bit more aware of our feelings and are able to try to articulate what is wrong. Because I feel like I was also an angsty teenager. But back then all of my angst was directed into
[00:12:24.500] 在情感上，我们大概到了二十五六岁，或者现在，我们只是更能意识到自己的感受，也能够尝试表达出哪里出了问题。因为我觉得自己也曾是个叛逆的青少年。但那时候，我所有的叛逆都指向了……
[00:12:39.460] some direction. Like I would be like, I fucking hate school, or I'm so mad at my parents or blah, blah, blah. Like there was always some sort of destination, I guess to whatever my angst was. But in adulthood, I feel like things aren't really
[00:12:39.460] 以前总有个方向。比如我会说，我真他妈讨厌学校，或者我好生我爸妈的气，等等等等。好像总有个目的地，能让我摆脱那些烦恼。但成年之后，我觉得事情就没那么顺利了。
[00:12:51.620] that clear cut. Like yes, you could hate your job, or maybe you don't like your living situation. But a lot of the times the vessel that is carrying all these emotions are just yourself. So even if you, you know, enact change in some
[00:12:51.620] 这一点很清楚。没错，你可能讨厌你的工作，或者你不喜欢你的居住环境。但很多时候，承载所有这些情绪的容器只是你自己。所以，即使你，你知道，在某些方面做出改变。
[00:13:04.020] way, physically, or environmentally, your body is still kind of coming along with you in that journey. So it is really cool that, you know, there is this big push for us in our 20s to kind of go to therapy and unpack these things to help
[00:13:04.020] 无论从生理还是环境方面来说，你的身体仍然会陪伴你经历这段旅程。所以，现在大力鼓励我们这些二十多岁的年轻人接受心理治疗，梳理这些问题，这真的很好。
[00:13:18.820] you digest everything that's going on emotionally, rather than just thinking in a black and white way like we used to in our teens. For sure. I think also, we often forget that 20s is honestly a really big chunk of our lives that's pretty formative and like
[00:13:18.820] 你会消化所有正在发生的情感变化，而不是像我们十几岁时那样非黑即白地思考。当然。而且我觉得，我们常常忘记，20多岁其实是我们人生中非常重要的一段时期，它塑造了我们的人格，而且……
[00:13:35.620] transitional, because we're like just entering more independent times. You know, we're finally out of school for like the first time in our lives. And a lot of things that we do in our 20s, habits that we build and like thoughts that
[00:13:35.620] 正处于过渡期，因为我们正步入更加独立的阶段。你知道，我们终于离开了学校，这在我们人生中还是第一次。我们在二十多岁时做的很多事情，养成的习惯，以及一些想法，都与此息息相关。
[00:13:52.900] we have are probably going to set up a lot of our like thought processes and like actions in the future as well. So yeah, I think you're both right, having taking time to really reflect, you know, whether it's by yourself or with a therapist is
[00:13:52.900] 我们现在所经历的，很可能会成为我们未来很多思维模式和行动方式的基础。所以，我觉得你们俩都说得对，花时间认真反思，无论是独自反思还是和心理咨询师一起反思，都是非常重要的。
[00:14:09.380] just like super helpful because I feel like it's really easy to get lost in your 20s. Like not know what you want to do, not know why you aren't happy or like, you know, why you feel so stuck, things like that.
[00:14:09.380] 真的超级实用，因为我觉得20多岁很容易迷失方向。比如不知道自己想做什么，不知道为什么不快乐，或者，你知道的，为什么感觉自己被困住了，诸如此类的问题。
[00:14:22.820] Totally. Actually, what's interesting is, I guess the way the media portrays therapy is always very like, oh, let's talk about your past. And like, let's talk about this, like clipboard out, you know, going into anecdotes and things like that.
[00:14:22.820] 完全正确。其实，我觉得有趣的是，媒体对心理治疗的描述总是像这样：哦，我们来聊聊你的过去吧。然后就像拿着记录板一样，开始讲一些轶事之类的。
[00:14:37.140] But one of the things that really struck me about going to therapy is the way my therapist kind of, I don't want to say like anti intellectualizes, but, you know, sort of simplifies my emotions in a way. So one of the things she said was, you know,
[00:14:37.140] 但让我印象深刻的一点是，我的治疗师处理问题的方式，我不想说她反理性，但她确实在某种程度上简化了我的情绪。她说的其中一句话是，你知道，
[00:14:52.340] I was like complaining about how I was feeling really sad and, you know, moping and like, you know, not feeling very encouraged to do anything a couple months ago. And she was like, Oh, do you think it's because it's like wintertime and
[00:14:52.340] 几个月前，我抱怨自己感觉很伤心，情绪低落，什么都提不起劲儿。她就说：“哦，你觉得是因为现在是冬天吗？”
[00:15:04.100] there's no sun? Like, have you been going out and like getting sun? And I was like, Well, I don't know if that has anything to do with that. But blah, blah, blah. But then, you know, that week after my session, I was like, taking more walks and kind
[00:15:04.100] 没有太阳吗？你是说，你最近有出去晒太阳吗？我就想，嗯，我不知道这跟晒伤有没有关系。总之，等等等等。但是，你知道，在那次治疗后的一周，我开始多散步，多做一些……
[00:15:14.980] of, you know, taking vitamin D pills and like doing stuff that is so things that kind of make me feel like just like an animal, you know, like, like a literal creature. And then I was like, I do feel better. So you know, sometimes I guess change doesn't
[00:15:14.980] 你知道，吃维生素D片，做些其他一些事情，这些事情让我感觉自己就像个动物，你知道，就像个活生生的生物。然后我就觉得，我的确感觉好多了。所以你知道，有时候，我想改变并不会……
[00:15:29.060] have to be so drastic and so deep and serious. Like sometimes it could be something so easy as like, go get more sun. Yeah, definitely. I mean, like seasonal affective disorder is a real thing. Most people just call it seasonal depression. But
[00:15:29.060] 必须非常极端、非常深刻、非常严重才行。有时候，原因可能很简单，比如多晒晒太阳。没错，绝对是这样。我的意思是，季节性情感障碍是真实存在的。大多数人只是把它叫做季节性抑郁症。
[00:15:43.780] I think especially for people who tend to be paler, like vitamin D deficiency is a real source of that type of stuff. I only know this because after I got my physical for the first time in
[00:15:43.780] 我觉得尤其对于肤色较浅的人来说，维生素D缺乏是造成这类问题的一个重要原因。我之所以知道这一点，是因为我第一次体检后……
[00:15:56.500] years, which you're supposed to do more often than I did, I found out that I was vitamin D deficient. So I started taking vitamin D supplements, and like going outside and taking walks, and it definitely improved my mood as well. Vitamin D. Who
[00:15:56.500] 多年来，你应该比我更频繁地锻炼身体，但我发现自己缺乏维生素D。于是我开始服用维生素D补充剂，也喜欢到户外散步，这确实改善了我的情绪。维生素D。谁？
[00:16:09.620] knew? I guess relating to seasons, though, do you guys feel like seasons have a big impact on your feelings of wanting change and things like that? Like, maybe in the summer, you feel more inspired to go out and do stuff? Or maybe in fall,
[00:16:09.620] 知道吗？不过，说到季节，你们觉得季节对你们想要改变之类的想法有很大影响吗？比如，夏天的时候，你们是不是更有动力出门做点什么？或者秋天的时候，
[00:16:24.740] you're like, Oh, this is a fresh start. Like, do you have any feelings associated with these different seasons? Definitely for spring and summer. Sometimes I'll like, look outside. And be like, Oh, you know, it's actually a really
[00:16:24.740] 你会觉得，哦，这是一个全新的开始。你对不同的季节有什么感觉吗？当然对春天和夏天有感觉。有时候我会看看窗外，然后想，哦，你知道吗，这其实是一个……
[00:16:37.700] nice day outside, I should like probably go take a walk instead of spending all day gaming inside. Right. And I think the reverse is also true where it could be fall or winter, and you look outside, and it's like really cold and chilly. And you
[00:16:37.700] 外面天气真好，我应该出去散散步，而不是整天待在屋里玩游戏。没错。反过来也一样，比如秋天或冬天，你往外一看，外面又冷又冷。
[00:16:49.060] kind of want to just bundle up at home and not really do any thing. So I can definitely see the lethargy when it's a much colder environment and like much more moody overcast, versus like the sun and warmer days being associated with happier, more productive things.
[00:16:49.060] 真想窝在家里，裹得严严实实什么都不做。所以，在寒冷阴沉的环境下，人们会感到昏昏欲睡，而阳光明媚、温暖宜人的日子则让人心情愉悦，工作效率也会更高，这一点我完全可以理解。
[00:17:07.060] I feel like for me, the start of a new season always makes me feel like, ooh, like we're in a new quarter, I should clean my room and like do spring cleaning at like the beginning of each
[00:17:07.060] 对我来说，每个新赛季的开始总是让我感觉，哦，就像进入了一个新的季度，我应该打扫一下房间，就像每个季度初都要来一次大扫除一样。
[00:17:21.140] season, kind of. I think it is tied to that whole idea of like, oh, kind of a fresh start to the year, or like part of the year, whether I actually end up doing anything or not, you know,
[00:17:21.140] 算是赛季吧。我觉得这跟“新的一年重新开始”或者“一年中的一部分”这个概念有关，不管我最终是否真的会做些什么，你知道的。
[00:17:33.140] that depends. But I think it's just kind of a nice way to think about it too. It's like, Oh, you know, maybe I didn't have the best couple months the previous quarter, well, it's going to be
[00:17:33.140] 那要看情况。但我认为这也是一种不错的思考方式。就像，哦，你知道，也许我上个季度的几个月过得不太好，嗯，接下来……
[00:17:43.700] a fresh quarter now. So we can try again or like try some new things, whatever the weather deems appropriate. I really like that, actually. And I feel like it says so much about how the academic schedule impacts us even, you know, like
[00:17:43.700] 现在又是一个新学期了。所以我们可以再试一次，或者尝试一些新的东西，一切都取决于天气情况。我真的很喜欢这一点。我觉得这充分说明了学业安排对我们的影响，即使……
[00:17:59.700] well into our 20s. Because every year during fall, I'm like, this is the year going to get shit done. And then I think about it. And I'm like, well, this is like the ninth month of
[00:17:59.700] 都二十好几了。因为每年秋天，我都会想，今年一定要把事情做成。然后我仔细想想，现在都已经是九个月了。
[00:18:08.660] the year. So I don't know why I keep thinking it's the year. But you know, it just feels like a fresh start. And I have this like desire to just plan out things be a little bit more productive. So I definitely do look forward to fall a little
[00:18:08.660] 今年。我也不知道为什么总觉得今年就是关键的一年。但你知道，感觉就像是全新的开始。我特别想好好规划一下，让自己更高效一些。所以我真的很期待秋天的到来。
[00:18:21.940] bit. Do that's true. During the summer, I'm always like extra lazy. I'm like, damn, the sun's out, like we should head home. It's really interesting to me that you feel that way during the fall and not during New Year's time, when everyone like
[00:18:21.940] 确实如此。夏天的时候，我总是特别懒。我会想，哎，太阳都出来了，我们该回家了。我觉得很有意思的是，你在秋天而不是新年的时候会有这种感觉，那时候大家都……
[00:18:41.220] has their New Year's resolutions. And it's like, oh, like I'm gonna change for the year like this is my year, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I feel like I personally, okay, well, I don't really relate to either like the fall or the New Year's
[00:18:41.220] 他们都立下了新年计划。然后就好像，哦，我要在新的一年里做出改变，今年是我的新年，等等等等。我觉得我个人，好吧，我其实对秋季或新年都没什么感觉。
[00:18:53.860] New Year new meeting. Just because like, I'll just keep chugging along on my goals throughout the year. But do you feel like you understand why there's a particular reason you feel that way in the fall versus the New Year?
[00:18:53.860] 新年新气象。因为我会继续朝着我的目标努力，直到新年。但是，你觉得你能理解为什么你在秋季和新年时会有这种感觉吗？
[00:19:04.580] I think a lot of it has to do with how fall was when the school year used to start like pre college, I guess even through college, that was kind of like the beginning of the school year. But I think also, it's kind of an easier time to
[00:19:04.580] 我觉得很大程度上跟以前秋季开学的方式有关，以前从大学预科到大学，秋季都算是新学年的开始。但我觉得，秋季也更容易……
[00:19:17.220] start your goals. Because if you do well, then it's like Christmas time soon. So then you get rewarded for like working on these goals. And if you fuck up, it's still Christmas soon. So it doesn't really matter. So to me, I like having that
[00:19:17.220] 开始设定你的目标吧。因为如果你做得好，那就感觉像过圣诞节一样快了。这样你就能因为努力实现这些目标而获得奖励。就算你搞砸了，圣诞节也快到了。所以其实都无所谓。对我来说，我喜欢这样。
[00:19:30.180] insurance of like, there's gonna be a good time soon anyway. But I feel like January starting new goals, then is really daunting. And for me, if I feel like I'm not gonna succeed, then I might be pretty discouraged to even start something.
[00:19:30.180] 感觉就像是给自己买了份保险，觉得好日子很快就会到来。但我感觉一月份开始制定新目标真的挺让人畏惧的。对我来说，如果我觉得自己不会成功，那我可能连开始都不愿意。
[00:19:44.900] So then having that full year in front of you with no time to reset until say, September or, you know, basically January, I'm kind of like, Oh, man, I still definitely do my New Year's resolutions. But fall is kind of like that easy
[00:19:44.900] 所以，接下来整整一年都摆在你面前，直到九月或者一月才有时间调整，我就会想，哎呀，我肯定还会坚持我的新年计划。但秋天就比较容易了。
[00:19:58.900] checkpoint, like easy starting mark compared to the seriousness of New Year's goals. I see. That makes sense, like three months left in the year. And that's like enough time to get some some goals crossed off your checklist. Yeah, maybe it's like cramming your goals before January.
[00:19:58.900] 就像一个检查点，比起新年目标的艰巨性，这算是个轻松的起点。我明白了。这说得通，毕竟一年还剩三个月。这段时间足够完成清单上的一些目标了。是啊，或许可以把它看作是在一月份之前把所有目标都集中起来完成。
[00:20:15.860] That honestly could be it. So procrastination. Exactly. You're like, I'm finally ready to make my New Year's resolution. Nine months into the year. Kind of continuing on the seasonal theme. Do you feel like even though winter and fall usually is more, I guess, quiet
[00:20:15.860] 确实有可能。所以，拖延症。没错。你会想，我终于可以制定新年计划了。结果都九个月过去了。这算是延续了季节的主题。你是不是觉得，虽然冬天和秋天通常比较安静？
[00:20:38.420] and like stay inside, staying comfortable, like you mentioned, Jeffrey, is it still productive? Even though we're like, you know, maybe spending less time outside of the house on average. I think that depends on your definition of productive or more so what your goals are, right?
[00:20:38.420] 就像你刚才提到的，杰弗里，待在家里，保持舒适，这样还能提高效率吗？即使我们平均而言可能待在户外的时间减少了。我认为这取决于你对“效率”的定义，或者更确切地说，取决于你的目标是什么，对吧？
[00:20:57.540] Because you can be productive if you set a lot of small, very achievable goals for yourself. And that can be done regardless of the season. Like, if you say I'm gonna clean my room today, I don't really think of what season it is really affects that, right? True.
[00:20:57.540] 因为如果你给自己设定许多小的、很容易实现的目标，你就能提高效率。而且这不受季节限制。比如，如果你说我今天要打扫房间，我不会觉得季节会影响这件事，对吧？没错。
[00:21:09.460] In terms of like overall productivity, I'm not sure if there's a trend. If I were to assume it probably would tick upwards towards summer and spring. I think that makes sense. And I think actually that question sort of brings me back to the whole
[00:21:09.460] 就整体生产力而言，我不确定是否存在某种趋势。如果非要推测的话，大概会在春夏两季略有上升。我觉得这合情合理。而且，这个问题实际上又让我回到了……
[00:21:23.620] like we as people are animals kinds of theory because I feel like my winter self and my summer self and my fall, like every season, I'm like a different version of myself. And I actually notice it in the types of goals that I make.
[00:21:23.620] 就像我们人类和动物一样，这种理论似乎成立，因为我觉得我的冬天、夏天和秋天，就像每个季节一样，我都是一个不同的版本。而且我确实能从我设定的目标类型中感受到这一点。
[00:21:39.460] So in winter, I feel like January through March, I'm usually not seeing a ton of people. I feel like that's when my social life is the most quiet. So then all of my goals are very like, I'm gonna read this many books
[00:21:39.460] 所以到了冬天，也就是一月到三月，我通常见不到很多人。我觉得那段时间我的社交生活最清闲。所以那时候我的目标就都变成了，比如我要读多少本书。
[00:21:50.420] and I'm gonna budget and like take care of my finances and blah, blah. And then I get into the spring and I'm like, okay, this year I want to travel this much. And like every single season, I feel like I have completely
[00:21:50.420] 然后我就开始做预算，好好理财等等等等。到了春天，我就想，好吧，今年我想去这么多地方旅行。但就像每个季节一样，我感觉自己完全……
[00:22:01.940] different goals, which sort of makes New Year's resolutions even harder to be honest. But maybe the type of productive I am in each season is kind of different. So then maybe I should be like setting my goals based on that.
[00:22:01.940] 不同的目标让新年计划变得更加困难，说实话。但也许我在每个季节的效率都不一样。所以，或许我应该根据这一点来设定目标。
[00:22:16.260] Like what if I've been doing this whole time? I'm like now realizing. Quarterly goals. Yeah. Do you think you change within a season or is it easier to like enact change with the change of seasons? I guess as a hypothetical example, maybe it's winter and instead of
[00:22:16.260] 如果我一直都在这样做呢？我现在才意识到。季度目标。是的。你觉得你会在一个季节内做出改变，还是更容易随着季节的变化而做出改变？我举个例子，假设现在是冬天，然后……
[00:22:37.140] enacting change in winter, you're kind of like, oh, once it becomes spring, I'm gonna try to do this stuff. Or in the winter, you're like, oh, you know what? I want to start doing this right now.
[00:22:37.140] 冬天想做出改变的时候，你可能会想，哦，等春天来了，我再去做这些事。或者冬天你想做点什么的时候，你可能会想，哦，你知道吗？我想现在就开始做这件事。
[00:22:49.700] I guess it's also tied to like, are you a plan it out a little bit longer or act now kind of person? I think for me personally, when it comes to enacting change, I definitely have to plan it out, but I also sort of scope things out
[00:22:49.700] 我觉得这还跟你是那种喜欢提前计划很久的人，还是那种喜欢立即行动的人有关。就我个人而言，在做出改变的时候，我肯定要先做好计划，但我也会先大致了解一下情况。
[00:23:06.180] so that I can start implementing something immediately. I think that's one of the nice things about planning is that you not only outline what's the problem? What are you trying to change and why? You're also looking into what small steps can I take to feel a little
[00:23:06.180] 这样我就可以立即开始实施一些措施。我认为计划的好处之一在于，它不仅能让你明确问题所在，以及你想改变什么、为什么，还能让你思考可以采取哪些小步骤来让自己感觉好一些。
[00:23:24.180] bit productive towards this goal that I have and something that I do when I am trying to plan literally anything out is I will make a goal that says create an outline and write out steps to achieve this goal. And that already makes me feel productive.
[00:23:24.180] 我朝着这个目标迈出了重要一步。我做任何事情的计划时，都会先设定一个目标，比如制定一个大纲，并写下实现目标的步骤。这样做本身就能让我感到很有成就感。
[00:23:39.300] That's a good one. Honestly, I think people forget that that in itself is a step that you have to take and once you get it down on paper, you have accomplished something. You've taken the first step.
[00:23:39.300] 这说得好。说实话，我觉得人们常常忘记，这本身就是你必须迈出的一步，一旦你把它写下来，你就完成了一件事。你已经迈出了第一步。
[00:23:51.860] Yeah, I think people definitely don't realize how hard the first step is. So if you make that first step as small as possible and as achievable as possible, then you're more likely to enact the rest of your change.
[00:23:51.860] 是的，我觉得人们肯定没有意识到迈出第一步有多难。所以，如果你把第一步设定得尽可能小、尽可能容易实现，那么你就更有可能完成接下来的改变。
[00:24:04.020] So I think I kind of have the opposite problem that I think a lot of people have because I love planning and I hate executing. So if you read through my journal, actually, it's really funny.
[00:24:04.020] 所以我觉得我的问题跟很多人正好相反，因为我喜欢计划，却讨厌执行。如果你翻阅我的日记，你会发现它其实很有趣。
[00:24:15.620] I have a lot of like almost like business plans for all my goals. It's like vivid. I can almost envision myself doing all these different steps, but I never got past like step three, basically.
[00:24:15.620] 我为我的所有目标都制定了很多类似商业计划的方案。这些方案非常清晰，我几乎可以想象自己一步一步地完成所有这些步骤，但基本上我从来没有完成过第三步。
[00:24:26.580] But one of the things that I find sort of interesting when I do look back at my old plans is that I feel like I'm always feeling very emotional when I start to want to embrace the change and like when I do start to plan it out.
[00:24:26.580] 但当我回顾过去的计划时，我发现一件很有趣的事情，那就是每当我想要接受改变，或者开始计划改变的时候，我总是会感到非常激动。
[00:24:41.700] And I feel like it's not in a very positive way. Like, I don't know how you guys feel when you sit down and you're like, OK, this is the day I'm going to like sit down and do something.
[00:24:41.700] 我觉得这并不是一种很积极的方式。比如，我不知道你们坐下来，心想“好吧，今天我要坐下来做点什么”的时候是什么感觉。
[00:24:50.980] But for me, every time I look back at like an old plan, I'm like, I'm so fucking tired of living like blah, blah, blah. Like, I hate that my life is like this. So therefore, these are the first steps.
[00:24:50.980] 但对我来说，每次回顾以前的计划，我都会想，我真是受够了这种无聊的生活。我讨厌现在的生活。所以，这些就是第一步。
[00:25:03.540] But I feel like if you're a more positive person, it could totally be like, oh, I'm so excited to like, you know, start my new life to achieve this goal. So here are my first steps. Do you guys lean towards a certain side of the spectrum at all?
[00:25:03.540] 但我觉得，如果你是个比较积极乐观的人，可能会觉得，哦，我太兴奋了，迫不及待地想要开启新生活，实现这个目标。所以，这是我的第一步。你们在积极乐观方面有没有偏向于哪一类呢？
[00:25:15.060] Maybe there's both like kind of in the middle. Sometimes it's from negative feelings like, oh, every day feels the same. Like I should probably do something about it and like, you know, figure out what I
[00:25:15.060] 或许两者兼而有之，介于两者之间。有时候，这种感觉源于负面情绪，比如，哦，每天都感觉一样。感觉自己应该做点什么，比如，你知道，想办法……
[00:25:29.460] would want to do and what would maybe bring some change or joy into life. But I think I've also had more positive experiences where it's like, oh, this seems so cool. I think I can incorporate this into my life and it would be a fun thing to do.
[00:25:29.460] 我想做一些事情，一些能给生活带来改变或快乐的事情。但我认为我也有过更多积极的经历，比如，哦，这看起来太棒了。我觉得我可以把它融入我的生活，而且这会是一件很有趣的事情。
[00:25:45.300] I'm trying to think if there's like one I lean towards more. Maybe like right now, at this point in time lately, maybe slightly more negative. It's like, oh, why am I tired all the time? Or like, am I, you know, too filling my plate too much?
[00:25:45.300] 我在想我是不是更倾向于其中一种想法。也许像现在这样，最近这段时间，我的想法可能稍微消极一些。比如，哎，我为什么总是这么累？或者，我是不是给自己安排的事情太多了？
[00:26:02.740] Like, do I need to chill? Like kind of that. Yeah, I'm not sure if I lean more towards one side or the other. But I definitely agree with Crystal where there's certain mundane things or things that
[00:26:02.740] 比如，我需要冷静一下吗？大概就是这种感觉。嗯，我不确定自己更倾向于哪一边。但我绝对同意Crystal的观点，有些事情确实很琐碎，或者……
[00:26:15.620] feel like chores that I may not be as particularly excited to start enacting change for. But on the flip side, there's also a lot of things where I feel like I have lofty goals for myself that I feel like really excited to make the first step.
[00:26:15.620] 有些事情感觉像是琐事，我可能不太愿意着手去做。但另一方面，也有很多事情我觉得自己有远大的目标，我很兴奋能迈出第一步。
[00:26:29.700] Those I think are always the easiest to get started with because you have all this motivation. You have all this drive and passion. And I wish I could sort of reconcile the two and be able to be more disciplined with
[00:26:29.700] 我觉得那些事情总是最容易入门的，因为你充满动力、干劲和热情。我希望自己能把这两者结合起来，变得更加自律。
[00:26:42.580] myself and be like, okay, I know this thing is going to suck. But I have to change it for the better because I know it sucks right now. So it will get better. But I've just been really bad about doing that because I'm lazy.
[00:26:42.580] 我对自己说，好吧，我知道这件事肯定很糟糕。但我必须做出改变，让它变得更好，因为我知道它现在很糟糕。所以它会好起来的。但我一直没能做到这一点，因为我太懒了。
[00:26:52.180] Yeah, I have kind of a funny example, I think, that leans more towards negative to neutral. For a while, I really struggled with getting ready to sleep slash getting ready in the morning.
[00:26:52.180] 是的，我有个挺有意思的例子，我觉得它更偏向于负面而非中性。有一段时间，我真的很难抽出时间准备睡觉和早上起床。
[00:27:09.460] It would be around bedtime and I would kind of crawl into bed and be thinking like, okay, I need to get up and wash my face, brush my teeth, be ready for bed essentially.
[00:27:09.460] 差不多到了睡觉时间，我会爬上床，心想，好吧，我得起来洗脸、刷牙，准备睡觉了。
[00:27:21.540] But I would just like stare at the bathroom door and be like, dude, that's like so much work. I have to brush my teeth for two whole minutes, wash my face, put lotion on, all of that stuff.
[00:27:21.540] 但我只会盯着浴室门发呆，心想，天哪，这也太麻烦了吧。我得刷整整两分钟牙，洗脸，涂润肤露，所有这些事。
[00:27:34.340] And sometimes it was just like really, really hard to do that. And at first, my thought was, okay, this needs to change. Do I just brute force it? Like go brush my teeth no matter how hard it is? Or is it like something else?
[00:27:34.340] 有时候，真的很难做到。一开始，我的想法是，好吧，这种情况必须改变。我应该强迫自己吗？比如不管多难都要去刷牙？还是应该采取其他方法？
[00:27:51.140] Maybe I'm too overwhelmed at work. Or maybe I'm not stimulated enough in life so that everything feels like a chore. Although my first step solution was not tied to any of that.
[00:27:51.140] 也许我工作压力太大了。又或许我生活缺乏刺激，所以做什么事都觉得像是在完成任务。不过，我最初的解决方案其实与这些都无关。
[00:28:08.980] I was like, okay, what if I got a water pick and it's a little more fun to brush my teeth and stuff? Or like, yeah, right. I'm like, what if I got new exciting toothpaste or something?
[00:28:08.980] 我当时就想，要是我有了水牙线，刷牙岂不是更有趣？或者，是啊，对啊。我又想，要是我有了新的、令人兴奋的牙膏之类的东西呢？
[00:28:24.020] Like just stupid shit like that, which I think did help a little bit. But when I stopped hyper focusing on the fact that I was like struggling to basically get up to brush my teeth and started looking at other aspects of my life, I think it actually helped.
[00:28:24.020] 就是诸如此类的蠢事，我觉得确实有点帮助。但当我不再过度关注自己连起床刷牙都困难这件事，而是开始关注生活的其他方面时，我觉得才真正有所帮助。
[00:28:42.100] Oh, interesting. So for you, it helped to not hyper focus on the minutiae and look at the little details. But it actually helped you to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:42.100] 哦，有意思。所以对你来说，不要过分关注细枝末节，而是退后一步，从更宏观的角度看待问题，反而更有帮助。是啊，是啊。
[00:28:53.220] It's like, oh, I guess I need to make sure my level of mental stimulation in life is at a good level versus too high versus too low. I think that's a really good example. And it's actually something that I've talked to my therapist about where, as always, I
[00:28:53.220] 感觉就像，哦，我想我需要确保生活中的精神刺激水平保持在一个合适的范围内，既不能太高也不能太低。我觉得这是一个很好的例子。实际上，我也和我的心理咨询师谈过这个问题，和往常一样，我
[00:29:14.180] was bitching in therapy one day and I was like, oh, I struggle so hard with this. And it bothers me so much that I can't do this. Blah, blah. And she was like, why do you have no empathy for yourself?
[00:29:14.180] 有一天我在心理咨询师那里抱怨，我说，哦，我在这方面挣扎了好久。我做不到这件事让我非常难过。等等等等。然后她问我，你为什么对自己一点同情心都没有？
[00:29:26.580] And why do you try to pick out all these things that you hate instead of wondering what is wrong in your situation or maybe what can be helped or changed a little bit to set you up for success?
[00:29:26.580] 为什么你总是试图找出所有你讨厌的事情，而不是思考你的处境出了什么问题，或者也许可以做出一些改变或改进，从而让你走向成功呢？
[00:29:38.420] And sometimes I forget that there are bigger reasons to things like you said. And other times I forget that there's not always only the hard path to walk. So, for example, in a couple of months I'm getting married.
[00:29:38.420] 有时候我会忘记，就像你说的，事情背后还有更深层次的原因。有时候我也会忘记，人生并非只有艰难的路要走。比如说，几个月后我就要结婚了。
[00:29:53.860] And so we're spending this whole year planning out this wedding, essentially. But I really, really wanted to start this new hobby before the end of the year. And I was telling my therapist about how I felt so overwhelmed, but I really had this passion for something.
[00:29:53.860] 所以基本上我们这一整年都在筹备婚礼。但我真的非常想在年底前开始这项新的爱好。我跟我的心理咨询师说了我感觉压力很大，但我真的对某件事充满热情。
[00:30:08.820] And she was like, well, why don't you just wait till next year once the wedding's over? And I was like, I totally forgot you could just do that. And this whole time I was like, how can I balance all 50 things on my plate at the same time?
[00:30:08.820] 她就说，那你为什么不等到明年婚礼结束后再说呢？我说，我完全忘了还可以这么做。而我当时一直在想，我怎么可能同时兼顾这五十件事呢？
[00:30:18.740] So it definitely does help, I think, to sort of take a step back and also to just be kinder to yourself when you're thinking about these things and not try to really pressure yourself to do everything all the time perfectly.
[00:30:18.740] 所以我觉得，退后一步，对自己好一点，在思考这些事情的时候，不要给自己施加压力，要求自己时时刻刻都做到完美，这肯定会有帮助。
[00:30:32.420] That's definitely something that I struggle with is having enough self-compassion and empathy for myself. Because I think growing up as an Asian American kid, it's really easy to be hypercritical of all your failures, even like the little one, just because that's sort of how we were raised, right?
[00:30:32.420] 我确实在这一点上很挣扎，那就是如何对自己有足够的同情心和同理心。因为我觉得作为一个亚裔美国孩子，从小就很容易对自己所有的失败都吹毛求疵，哪怕是很小的失败，因为我们从小就是这样被教育的，对吧？
[00:30:47.380] So it's taken a lot of, at least a lot of my 20s to sort of undo that brainwashing I gave myself as a kid. And I think you're right, Jisoo, where it manifests sort of as a, just like a gentle
[00:30:47.380] 所以，我花了很长时间，至少是我二十多岁的大部分时间，才逐渐摆脱了小时候给自己灌输的那种思想观念。我觉得你说得对，Jisoo，它表现为一种，就像一种温柔的……
[00:31:01.460] reminder that you don't have to do all these things at once and you have the ability to prioritize. One of the things that I've sort of heard recently that I really enjoy is that you should
[00:31:01.460] 提醒你，你不必一次性完成所有这些事情，而且你有能力分清轻重缓急。我最近听到的一句话我很喜欢，那就是你应该……
[00:31:11.620] replace the phrase, I don't have time for this in your vocabulary with, I can't prioritize this right now. And it really reshifts the way that you think about your time and the things that you have
[00:31:11.620] 用“我现在无法优先处理这件事”来替换你词汇表中的“我没时间做这件事”。这会彻底改变你对时间和所拥有事物的看法。
[00:31:23.060] to do because now you're not saying like, oh, I can't do this right now. Well, I mean, you kind of are saying like, I can't do this right now, but it's less so
[00:31:23.060] 这样做是因为你现在不会再说“哦，我现在做不了这件事”了。嗯，我的意思是，你其实还是有点儿在说“我现在做不了这件事”，但这种感觉已经淡了很多。
[00:31:29.860] like a, I can't do this right now, but I can get to it when I do X, Y, and Z. Right. I like that kind of like reframing your no into a no but.
[00:31:29.860] 就像，我现在做不到，但我做完X、Y和Z之后就能做到。对。我喜欢这种把“不”改成“但是”的方式。
[00:31:42.340] I guess it's also instead of just a, you know, hard line, you're like, this is still something I want to do. And it's like a mental reminder. I really like that. It does sound a little corporate, but. Yes, and. I'm a product manager, it's what I do.
[00:31:42.340] 我觉得这不仅仅是一条硬性规定，而是你会想，这仍然是我想做的事情。它就像一种精神上的提醒。我真的很喜欢这种感觉。这听起来有点像公司说辞，但是……是的，而且……我是一名产品经理，这就是我的工作。
[00:32:02.900] I spend all day prioritizing things. But I feel like you're right. Like it's such an important skill to have anyway. I guess sometimes we get so focused on work stuff that we forget.
[00:32:02.900] 我整天都在分清轻重缓急。但我觉得你说得对，这的确是一项非常重要的技能。我想有时候我们太专注于工作，反而会忘记这一点。
[00:32:13.540] We can also like shuffle around the priorities in life too and like find that right balance that we've kind of been talking about. So sometimes you just got to pull out the corpse speak and realize that like, you know,
[00:32:13.540] 我们也可以在生活中重新调整优先事项，找到我们一直在谈论的那种平衡。所以有时候你只需要说出一些不那么严肃的话，然后意识到，你知道，
[00:32:27.700] life is also something that you can improve and work on. Oh God, life is work. Life is work. That is true. So I have a question for you both. And it's something that I have mentioned on this podcast that I tend to struggle with.
[00:32:27.700] 生活也是可以不断改进和努力的。天哪，生活就是工作。生活就是工作。没错。所以我有个问题想问问你们俩。这个问题我在这个播客里也提到过，我一直都在努力克服。
[00:32:44.420] So I'm also curious if this is something that you guys experience as well. But a lot of the times I think when I am seeking change in my life, it comes from external sources as well as internal.
[00:32:44.420] 所以，我也很想知道你们是否也有过类似的经历。很多时候，我觉得当我寻求改变时，这种改变既来自外部因素，也来自内部因素。
[00:32:58.660] So, you know, oftentimes I'm like, oh, I don't want to feel like this anymore. So I will enact change. But you know, sometimes it's straight up like I envy what this person has in their life or I think it's really cool that this person does this.
[00:32:58.660] 所以，你知道，很多时候我会想，哦，我不想再这样下去了。所以我决定做出改变。但你知道，有时候我也会直接羡慕这个人拥有的生活，或者觉得这个人做的事情真的很酷。
[00:33:11.220] So I want to emulate my life in some way to look like theirs. And I have to guess that this is somewhat common in our 20s. But do you guys ever experience something like this? Yeah, all the time.
[00:33:11.220] 所以我想在某种程度上模仿他们的生活。我猜这在20多岁的时候应该挺常见的。你们有没有过类似的经历？有啊，经常有。
[00:33:26.660] I think it's really easy to compare yourself to other people. Not only because that's just literally what happened to us growing up as Asian kids, but also just with how readily available social media is and how people always post the highlights of their lives.
[00:33:26.660] 我觉得人们很容易拿自己和别人比较。这不仅是因为我们亚洲孩子从小就经常被拿来和别人比较，也因为社交媒体如此普及，人们总是喜欢在社交媒体上分享自己生活中的精彩瞬间。
[00:33:42.180] It's really easy to sort of get lost in the rat race of being like, oh, well, I feel like I'm doing well. But then this person is doing like n plus one times better than I am.
[00:33:42.180] 很容易陷入这种无休止的竞争中，觉得自己做得还不错，但其实另一个人比我做得好得多。
[00:33:52.260] Or like this, like I have these life goals, like I wanted to buy a house or get a car. But this person already has all that and a kid. So it's really, really easy to get lost in comparing yourself.
[00:33:52.260] 或者像这样，我有一些人生目标，比如我想买房或买车。但这个人已经拥有了这一切，还有一个孩子。所以，很容易陷入与他人比较的陷阱。
[00:34:04.660] And I've tried really hard to sort of stay away from that side of social media because I know I have these tendencies. So I just don't even allow myself to get into these situations anymore. That's a smart move. I totally agree with everything that Jeffrey said.
[00:34:04.660] 我一直努力远离社交媒体的那些方面，因为我知道自己有这些倾向。所以我干脆不再让自己陷入那种境地。这真是个明智之举。我完全同意杰弗里说的所有内容。
[00:34:20.260] And I kind of have been thinking about it lately and started to realize that another layer to all of this, like comparison and social media stuff is that when you see someone who has achieved a certain goal that maybe you want, you're actually envisioning it in
[00:34:20.260] 最近我一直在思考这个问题，开始意识到，像攀比和社交媒体之类的东西，还有更深层次的原因：当你看到别人实现了你也想实现的某个目标时，你实际上是在想象自己也能做到。
[00:34:39.940] your own terms. But that might not be the way that they achieved it. So I guess an example could be, maybe someone bought this super fancy car. And in your mind, you're like, oh my god, they spent so much money. They bought this car.
[00:34:39.940] 按照你自己的方式。但他们实现目标的方式可能并非如此。举个例子，也许有人买了一辆超级豪华的车。你会想，我的天哪，他们花了这么多钱。他们居然买了这辆车。
[00:34:55.780] But what if they're just leasing it because they got a really good deal or they're borrowing a family car or something like that. And you have no idea because you're just thinking, oh, this is probably how I would achieve that goal.
[00:34:55.780] 但如果他们只是因为租到了很划算的车而选择租赁，或者借用家里的车之类的呢？而你却毫不知情，因为你只是在想，哦，这大概就是我实现目标的方式。
[00:35:09.380] So that's probably how they achieved that goal. But that's not true. Probably 80% of the time. Yeah, I think that's a really good way of putting it. And you never see what other people are sacrificing. You only see the end result.
[00:35:09.380] 所以他们大概就是这么实现目标的。但事实并非如此。可能80%的情况下都是如此。嗯，我觉得这个说法很贴切。你永远看不到别人为此付出了什么，你看到的只是最终结果。
[00:35:25.220] And I feel like it's so hard to kind of think in that perspective, at least for me. And something that I've been thinking about a lot lately is I always talk about how I have really bad baby fever and I want to have kids soon.
[00:35:25.220] 我觉得要从那个角度思考问题真的很难，至少对我来说是这样。最近我一直在想的一件事是，我总是说我特别想要孩子，想尽快要孩子。
[00:35:39.700] And if I'm torturing myself now by being jealous of people or constantly thinking and comparing myself to other people's lives, then when I have kids, that kid is going to also have to go through that.
[00:35:39.700] 如果我现在因为嫉妒别人或不断地思考和比较自己与别人的生活而折磨自己，那么当我有了孩子，我的孩子也将不得不经历这一切。
[00:35:53.060] Like, am I going to be the mom that inflicts that onto my kid? And I feel like that gives me a lot of encouragement to try to work on this now and sort of get
[00:35:53.060] 比如，我会不会成为那种把这种观念强加给孩子的妈妈？我觉得这给了我很大的动力，让我现在就开始努力，争取早日改变这种状况。
[00:36:01.460] ahead of it before I become an actual mother because that's something that I don't want to pass down. Not to say that my parents passed it down to me, but sometimes that is really what happens. So I feel like all these things right now are self-improvement.
[00:36:01.460] 在我真正成为母亲之前，我想先做好这件事，因为我不想把这种缺点遗传给下一代。倒不是说我的父母把这种缺点遗传给了我，但有时候确实会发生这种情况。所以我感觉现在做的这些事都是为了自我提升。
[00:36:16.660] But lately, I've been thinking it's not just for myself, but maybe it's for the good of my household or me and my husband or me and my child and things like that. So it gives me a little bit more encouragement to work on it.
[00:36:16.660] 但最近，我一直在想，这不仅仅是为了我自己，也许也是为了我的家庭，为了我和我的丈夫，为了我和我的孩子等等。所以这给了我更多努力的动力。
[00:36:29.140] Oh, my God, that's such a good point. Because even if you're maybe not directly comparing, say, your child with other people, they could be maybe seeing you comparing yourself with other people and pick up on that. Yeah, kids are really smart. It's terrifying.
[00:36:29.140] 我的天哪，你说得太对了。就算你没有直接拿孩子跟别人比较，他们也可能看到你拿自己跟别人比较，然后从中察觉到。是啊，孩子真的很聪明。真是太可怕了。
[00:36:45.860] They pick up on a lot of minutiae that we don't even think about. And that's sort of one of the things, too, that kind of freaks me out about having a kid in the future is that I want to be a good parent.
[00:36:45.860] 他们能注意到很多我们根本想不到的细节。而这，也是我未来有点害怕要不要生孩子的原因之一，因为我想成为一个好父母。
[00:36:57.540] And I know what all the lessons I took away from my parents were. And I know all the things that I should and shouldn't do. But I'm worried about the stuff that I've missed. I'm really worried about maybe some of the subconscious behaviors that I have that I
[00:36:57.540] 我知道我从父母那里学到了什么，也知道哪些事该做，哪些事不该做。但我担心自己错过了什么。我真的很担心自己可能存在的一些潜意识行为。
[00:37:10.260] don't even think about that could potentially lead them to having a negative childhood or just a negative experience. Well, the good thing is I feel like since these are thoughts that we think about, that
[00:37:10.260] 别去想这些，它们可能会导致他们拥有不愉快的童年经历或负面体验。不过，好的一面是，我觉得既然这些都是我们自己会想到的，那么……
[00:37:23.220] in itself proves that we are people who would be willing to work on this and improve. And that already is a very good baseline for parenthood, I think. But you're right. It's definitely a scary thought. Children are just so moldable. Yeah.
[00:37:23.220] 这本身就证明我们是愿意努力改进的人。我觉得这已经是为人父母的一个很好的基本条件了。但你说得对，这确实让人有点害怕。孩子太容易被塑造了。是啊。
[00:37:42.360] You know, now that I think about it, it's kind of dumb that you're not like there's no way to practice being a mom before you're a mom. Is there some place you could go to like roleplay being a mom or something like a fake baby
[00:37:42.360] 你知道吗，现在想想，你居然没想过在当妈之前练习当妈妈，这真是有点蠢。有没有什么地方可以让你体验一下当妈妈的感觉，比如角色扮演之类的，或者用假婴儿之类的？
[00:37:56.120] or even like a fake toddler? Because you're right. Like, I feel like there are so many things that, you know, when you're really tired, not getting a ton of sleep, just driving your kid to work.
[00:37:56.120] 或者像个假装的小孩？因为你说得对。我觉得有很多事情，你知道，当你真的很累，睡眠不足，还要开车送孩子上班的时候。
[00:38:05.640] Like what if you say something that's so normal and so forgettable, but the kid, it's you're their world and it like fucks them up forever. I mean, not to instill more fear in everyone's hearts, but it's like I totally know where you're coming from.
[00:38:05.640] 比如，如果你说了句很普通、很容易被遗忘的话，但对孩子来说，你是他们的全世界，这句话可能会永远毁了他们。我的意思是，我不是想让大家更害怕，但我完全理解你的感受。
[00:38:18.520] And, you know, even for things like golf, there's like driving ranges where you can go and practice. But I don't know why there isn't anything like that for parenthood. Dude, we need to invent like a VR game and like AI babies, you know? Yeah.
[00:38:18.520] 你知道，就连高尔夫这种运动，都有练习场可以去练习。但我不知道为什么育儿方面就没有类似的东西。老兄，我们需要发明类似VR游戏和人工智能宝宝之类的东西，你知道吗？是啊。
[00:38:34.520] You know, the sad thing is that the people who really need this the most won't do it or like won't look into it because they think that they're going to be great parents. Right?
[00:38:34.520] 你知道，最可悲的是，那些最需要这种帮助的人要么不会去做，要么根本不会去了解，因为他们认为自己会成为很棒的父母。对吧？
[00:38:43.640] And on the topic of like practicing parenthood, I have heard from pet owners that it's a great way to see if you're ready for a kid. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Because you sort of go through the same things as raising a child when you're raising a pet.
[00:38:43.640] 说到练习为人父母，我听一些宠物主人说，养宠物是检验自己是否准备好要孩子的好方法。哦，有意思。是啊。因为养宠物和养孩子有很多相似之处。
[00:38:55.960] It's like you have to teach them good behaviors. You have to be relatively attentive to them. You have to look after their needs. Even while yours aren't being met necessarily, you still have to be a good owner for them.
[00:38:55.960] 这就像你需要教导它们良好的行为习惯。你需要对它们给予足够的关注。你需要照顾它们的需求。即使你的需求未必能得到满足，你仍然要做一个称职的主人。
[00:39:09.480] Oh my god, I was actually just talking with some of my friends about that this past weekend. We're like, yeah, if you're a pet owner, you learn to be really selfless and like just exactly what you said, Jeffrey. Like you have to put their needs above yours sometimes.
[00:39:09.480] 我的天哪，我上周末正好跟几个朋友聊到这个。我们都觉得，养宠物的人真的会变得很无私，就像你说的，杰弗里。有时候你必须把它们的需求放在自己的需求之上。
[00:39:25.800] And also you realize like how much work it is just to take care of another dependent basically. Jesus was like, ah, yes, next year we'll get a dog. So I have another question for us all. And it's kind of like the reverse of what we've been talking about.
[00:39:25.800] 而且你也会意识到，照顾另一个需要赡养的人到底有多累。耶稣说，啊，是的，明年我们养条狗。所以我还有一个问题想问大家。这个问题和我们之前讨论的内容正好相反。
[00:39:43.320] So we've been talking about like planning and enacting for change, I guess stemming from just signs that we feel like there might need to be change that we need to start doing.
[00:39:43.320] 所以我们一直在讨论如何规划和实施变革，我想这源于一些迹象，我们感觉可能需要做出一些改变，而我们需要开始着手改变。
[00:39:55.800] But has there ever been, I guess like change forced upon you that you know you have to do, but you're kind of scared of it? And then that might lead to like some sort of stagnation or like procrastination on your part?
[00:39:55.800] 但是，你有没有过这样的经历：被迫做出改变，你知道自己必须去做，但又有点害怕？然后，这可能会导致你停滞不前或者拖延？
[00:40:10.840] Or is it like, I guess, or do you like handle it well? Yeah, so I've definitely been in a situation where life sort of just happened and I had to roll with the punches. That was when I got laid off last year.
[00:40:10.840] 或者，我猜是这样，或者说，你处理得很好？是的，我确实经历过那种生活突然变故，我只能随机应变的情况。去年我被裁员的时候就是这种情况。
[00:40:24.440] And one of the things I realized was that I didn't really know why I was still living in the Bay after I got laid off. Because I had moved to the Bay for work. And I almost gaslit myself into thinking like, oh, I should stay here because like
[00:40:24.440] 我意识到的一件事是，我其实不知道自己失业后为什么还住在湾区。因为我当初是为了工作才搬到湾区的。我几乎是自欺欺人地想，哦，我应该留在这里，因为……
[00:40:38.920] the job opportunities are better. But then with the world sort of moving into more remote and hybrid situations, especially with COVID happening, I sort of asked myself, like, why am I still here?
[00:40:38.920] 工作机会确实更好了。但是随着世界逐渐走向远程办公和混合办公模式，尤其是在新冠疫情爆发之后，我开始问自己，我为什么还留在这里？
[00:40:53.080] And the answer I told myself was, well, obviously, like, I love the people I hang out with. I love my friends. And I wanted to stay there for them. But I don't know if it necessarily made sense for me, both in terms of job opportunities
[00:40:53.080] 我告诉自己的答案是，很显然，我爱和我在一起的人，我爱我的朋友们，我想为了他们留下来。但我不知道这对我来说是否真的有意义，无论从工作机会的角度来看。
[00:41:04.760] and also financially, because that stuff is really expensive. True. So that was sort of the thing that forced me to think more critically about where I was going to live and why I was living there.
[00:41:04.760] 而且经济上也是个问题，因为那些东西真的很贵。没错。所以这件事迫使我更认真地思考我要住在哪里，以及我为什么要住在那里。
[00:41:17.560] And that's sort of already just added to the stress that I already had about living in the Bay. I don't want to talk too negatively about the Bay because I know a lot of people really enjoy living there and have a lot of awesome friends that live there.
[00:41:17.560] 这无疑加剧了我原本就对住在湾区感到焦虑的压力。我不想过多地贬低湾区，因为我知道很多人真的很喜欢住在那里，而且在那里有很多很棒的朋友。
[00:41:31.000] But personally, I just did not have a good experience both with living there when I was employed and also having to deal with the fall of unemployment there. I mean, I feel like the Bay is very like, I guess it's always talked up, hyped up like,
[00:41:31.000] 但就我个人而言，无论是之前在那里工作时的生活体验，还是后来失业潮带来的种种不便，我都没有过很好的经历。我的意思是，我觉得旧金山湾区总是被过度吹捧、过度美化，就像……
[00:41:47.080] oh, similarly to what you said, like all this job opportunity. It's like a great place to live. It's like a great place to live, all these things. But I guess once you really are there, you're kind of like, okay, this place is so fucking
[00:41:47.080] 哦，就像你说的，工作机会很多。这里简直是个很棒的居住地。这里的一切都很美好。但我想，一旦你真正到了那里，你就会觉得，好吧，这地方真是太他妈的……
[00:42:01.800] expensive and everything is so far apart. There's just a lot more cons that are overlooked and it definitely does not fit everyone's personality. And there's also the tech bubble, which I feel like a lot of people who live in the
[00:42:01.800] 价格昂贵，而且所有地方都相距甚远。还有很多其他缺点被忽略了，而且它绝对不适合每个人的个性。此外，还有科技泡沫的问题，我觉得很多住在那里的人都深受其害。
[00:42:16.680] Bay Area love to hate on or discuss how there's just like certain tech culture there that is, if you're in it, it's great. If you're ignorant about it, that's also great. But if you see it, it's just like something that's really in your face and you're like,
[00:42:16.680] 湾区的人总是喜欢吐槽或者讨论那里的某种科技文化：如果你身处其中，那当然很棒；如果你对此一无所知，那也很好。但如果你亲身接触到它，它就像一股强大的力量扑面而来，让你不禁感叹：
[00:42:34.360] okay, this is quite weird if you really stop to think about it. Yeah, definitely. So I don't blame you for having some dislike for the Bay. I feel like there's a lot of people who grew up in the Bay who can probably also sympathize
[00:42:34.360] 好吧，仔细想想，这确实挺奇怪的。没错，确实如此。所以我不怪你对湾区有些反感。我觉得很多在湾区长大的人可能也能理解你的感受。
[00:42:49.240] with that where there's just certain aspects that you don't love and are not super great. And you're like, okay, why is the Bay always talked up so much? Like so disproportionately so. Yeah, it feels like one of those things where you visit a place for vacation, you think
[00:42:49.240] 就是有些方面你不喜欢，也不是特别好。然后你就会想，好吧，为什么旧金山湾区总是被吹捧得那么高？简直名不副实。是啊，感觉就像你去某个地方度假，你觉得……
[00:43:07.560] you want to live there and you're sort of going in with rose-tinted glasses because you're on vacation, right? You're having a good time and you're really enjoying it. And then once you move in, that's sort of when reality sets in. And I think that's definitely the same case.
[00:43:07.560] 你想住在那儿，但因为你是在度假，所以有点戴着玫瑰色眼镜，对吧？你玩得很开心，真的很享受。但一旦你搬进去，现实就来了。我觉得情况肯定是一样的。
[00:43:22.840] That's the same thing with the Bay Area where I've heard a lot of people talk it up. There's all this to talk about innovation, entrepreneurship, and all that stuff. But the reality of living there is really quite mundane.
[00:43:22.840] 旧金山湾区也是一样，我听很多人吹捧那里。大家都在谈论创新、创业等等。但实际上，在那里生活却相当平淡无奇。
[00:43:35.560] And the tech culture, as you mentioned, is also very in your face. As someone who worked in tech, I could not believe how loud some people were about it. It's kind of crazy. I have a funny mini anecdote about tech culture here.
[00:43:35.560] 正如你所说，科技文化也非常张扬。作为一名曾经在科技行业工作的人，我简直不敢相信有些人对科技文化如此大肆宣扬。这简直太疯狂了。我这里有个关于科技文化的趣闻轶事。
[00:43:52.280] So last night, I went to a party of people that I didn't really know. And a lot of them were a couple years younger, probably at least three years or so younger.
[00:43:52.280] 昨晚我去参加了一个聚会，参加聚会的人我都不太认识。他们很多人比我小几岁，可能至少小三岁左右。
[00:44:01.800] And the first thing we see when we walk in was there was someone on the couch and he had his laptop open. And mind you, there's like 30 people in this house. Everyone's talking and drinking and having a good time.
[00:44:01.800] 我们一进门就看到沙发上坐着一个人，笔记本电脑开着。要知道，这房子里大概有30个人。大家都在聊天、喝酒，玩得很开心。
[00:44:14.280] And then he was just on chat GPT for 20 minutes. And I was like, this is so Bay Area. And it's just so funny. And it's the perfect anecdote. It's like that I feel isn't uncommon. It's hilarious.
[00:44:14.280] 然后他就在聊天软件GPT上聊了20分钟。我就想，这太湾区了。真的太搞笑了。这简直是个完美的轶事。我觉得这种情况并不罕见。太逗了。
[00:44:26.440] But it is something that probably people would see at different sorts of social settings. So totally get what you mean about tech culture, especially since I myself don't work in tech. I find it hilarious. And I love to point it out anytime I see it.
[00:44:26.440] 但这种现象在各种社交场合都可能出现。所以我完全理解你说的科技文化，尤其是我自己也不在科技行业工作。我觉得这太搞笑了。每次看到这种现象，我都喜欢指出来。
[00:44:41.800] So wait, what was he doing on chat GPT? I'm so curious. I don't know. There were like a lot of people just sitting around and playing cards. And he was just like on chat GPT. Because like, how do I interact at a party?
[00:44:41.800] 等等，他怎么会在聊天室里玩GPT？我好好奇。我也不知道。当时好像很多人都在围坐着玩牌，他就在聊天室里玩GPT。因为，我怎么能在聚会上跟人互动呢？
[00:44:54.520] Yeah, like how do I navigate social situations? And it's really not to say I'm the most social person because if you know me, you know, I'm hella awkward and have social anxiety. But that to me is just peak Bay Area. It really is. It really is.
[00:44:54.520] 是啊，比如我该怎么应对社交场合？其实我并不是很擅长社交，因为如果你了解我，就知道我超级不善交际，还有社交焦虑。但我觉得这简直就是湾区特有的写照。真的，真的。
[00:45:09.640] Yeah, I will say it's nice because I thought I was like really socially awkward and shy. But man, there have been some people that make me feel really good about myself. I feel like a funny thing about the Bay Area is that almost every stereotype you hear,
[00:45:09.640] 是的，我得说这感觉真好，因为我以前觉得自己特别不善交际，很害羞。但是，说真的，有些人真的让我感觉很棒。我觉得湾区一个很有趣的地方是，你听到的几乎所有刻板印象，
[00:45:23.960] whether it's like a positive or a negative stereotype is probably true. Like you'll probably be able to find it. The amount of Patagucci that I've seen is insane. Although I hear that Patagonia isn't like the like what's in with tech people anymore. It's now all about architects.
[00:45:23.960] 不管这算不算正面的刻板印象，可能都是真的。你大概也能找到。我见过的Patagonia简直多得离谱。不过我听说Patagonia现在不太受科技圈人士的追捧了，现在建筑师们都穿它。
[00:45:41.080] It's actually also because Patagonia a couple years ago made a new rule, they refuse to embroider company logos on their clothes. Now, their official reason is because it makes it harder to recycle the clothes because they do like you know how you can return some Patagonia clothes
[00:45:41.080] 实际上，这还因为 Patagonia 几年前制定了一项新规定：他们拒绝在衣服上绣公司标志。现在，他们的官方解释是，这样做会使衣服更难回收，因为你知道 Patagonia 的衣服是可以退换的。
[00:46:00.520] to get sold on there like worn wear or whatever. So that's like one of the excuses. But I think also they're probably sick of having that reputation when Patagonia is actually really good for what they're actually made for like hiking and like nature stuff.
[00:46:00.520] 他们会把产品当作旧衣服之类的卖出去。这算是其中一个借口吧。但我觉得他们可能也厌倦了这种名声，毕竟巴塔哥尼亚的产品其实很适合他们真正擅长的领域，比如徒步旅行和户外运动。
[00:46:17.640] Yeah, there's been so many times where James and I will go out to grab food and then we'll like be seated next to a bunch of tech bros and they're like literally screaming about how much money they make, how much they've made on crypto or whatever.
[00:46:17.640] 是啊，我和詹姆斯出去吃饭的时候，经常会遇到一群科技圈的男生坐在我们旁边，他们会大声嚷嚷自己赚了多少钱，在加密货币上赚了多少钱之类的。
[00:46:30.680] And I'm just like listening to them the whole time. Me and James aren't even talking anymore, we're just listening to them. That has happened to me so many times where I've been just grabbing dinner somewhere.
[00:46:30.680] 我就一直听他们说话。我和詹姆斯都不说话了，就只是听他们聊。这种情况我遇到过很多次了，就是随便找个地方吃晚饭的时候。
[00:46:41.160] I think the first time it happened to me, I was in downtown Mountain View. We're on Castro just getting dinner and I hear all these tech people talking about Kubernetes, like the newest tech stack, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:41.160] 我记得第一次遇到这种情况是在山景城中心。当时我们正在卡斯特罗街吃晚饭，突然听到一群技术人员在谈论 Kubernetes，说什么最新的技术栈之类的，等等等等。
[00:46:50.520] And I'm like, dude, it's like 8pm, shouldn't we be enjoying dinner? Like why are you still talking about work? Seriously, it's always really good for people who have spent a long time living in the Bay
[00:46:50.520] 我当时就想，哥们儿，都晚上八点了，我们不应该好好吃晚饭吗？你还在聊工作干嘛？说真的，这对在湾区生活很久的人来说总是很有益的。
[00:47:02.360] to spend even just like an internship, like a couple months outside of the Bay to regain some perspective because it's so easy to get stuck in that tech bubble. And I guess to tie it back in with the idea of change,
[00:47:02.360] 哪怕只是像实习一样，在湾区以外的地方待上几个月，也能让人重新审视自己的生活，因为很容易陷入科技泡沫中。我想，这和“改变”这个概念又联系了起来。
[00:47:16.760] sometimes it's hard to see these signs because you're so used to your day-to-day life that you don't realize you're missing out on what's happening with the rest of the world. You're losing touch with reality kind of. Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:47:16.760] 有时候很难注意到这些迹象，因为你太习惯于日复一日的生活，以至于没有意识到自己错过了世界上正在发生的事情。你有点脱离现实了。嗯，说得对。
[00:47:31.320] And I know earlier, Jeffrey, you also mentioned that in some ways you were almost gaslighting yourself into thinking, no, it's fine for me to stay here. Maybe I'll get over these feelings or maybe it's just me, things like that.
[00:47:31.320] 我知道杰弗里，你之前也提到过，在某种程度上，你几乎是在自我欺骗，让自己觉得，不，我留在这里也没什么不好。也许我会克服这些感觉，或者也许只是我自己的问题，诸如此类。
[00:47:43.240] And I feel like sometimes there is a certain path that is probably ideal for you in your situation. But I feel like a lot of the times we might not want to walk that path because change is scary.
[00:47:43.240] 我觉得有时候，在你的情况下，可能存在一条最适合你的路。但我觉得很多时候，我们可能不想走这条路，因为改变令人恐惧。
[00:47:54.840] And having to kind of deal with all of that on top of the stress of finding a new job, things like that, I can imagine is very overwhelming. So for me personally, I think my fear of change is one of the biggest
[00:47:54.840] 再加上找新工作的压力，还要应对所有这些事情，我能想象到，这确实让人不堪重负。所以对我个人而言，我认为我对变化的恐惧是我最大的问题之一。
[00:48:07.320] things that stopped me from having more change in my life where I'm like, this is so routine. Like if I don't change anything, I don't have to do anything. So the lazy girl in me is like, this is the best.
[00:48:07.320] 有些事阻碍了我做出更多改变，让我觉得“这样太循规蹈矩了”。好像如果我什么都不改变，我就什么都不用做。所以我内心那个懒惰的女孩会想：这样最好。
[00:48:18.360] But in the long run, the earlier you enact change, the better it might be. Or maybe you'll see more opportunities and experience more things. So it's definitely something that I find challenging in my daily life. I think that's true for most people.
[00:48:18.360] 但从长远来看，你越早做出改变，结果可能就越好。或许你会发现更多机会，体验更多事物。所以，这确实是我在日常生活中遇到的一个挑战。我想这对大多数人来说也是如此。
[00:48:31.800] I think change is really scary because we're so used to being comfortable. And I think the biggest thing is that with change, there brings some level of uncertainty and that terrifies our little monkey brains. Yeah, really good point.
[00:48:31.800] 我觉得改变真的很可怕，因为我们太习惯安逸了。而且我觉得最主要的是，改变会带来一定程度的不确定性，这会让我们的大脑感到恐惧。嗯，说得太对了。
[00:48:49.480] And we kind of mentioned this earlier in the episode too, that sometimes change doesn't even have to be super big. You can start with something pretty small and then from there it can snowball or just like
[00:48:49.480] 我们之前在节目里也提到过，有时候改变并不需要很大。你可以从很小的事情开始，然后它就会像滚雪球一样越滚越大，或者就像……
[00:49:04.520] maybe even a small tweak is what you needed instead of just immediately jumping to the biggest thing. So I will admit that in the past, there's been moments where at work I was thinking like, oh, do I like my job?
[00:49:04.520] 或许你需要的只是做一些小小的调整，而不是一下子就去做最大的改变。所以我承认，过去在工作中，我也曾有过这样的时刻：我会想，哦，我喜欢我的工作吗？
[00:49:20.040] Do I like the people that I work with? And then I'm like, damn, maybe it's me. Maybe I'm too awkward. Okay, the solution is just get a new job. But reasonably you could also just try a little harder to interact with the people.
[00:49:20.040] 我喜欢我的同事吗？然后我就想，糟了，也许是我自己的问题。也许是我太不善交际了。好吧，解决办法就是换份工作。但其实你也可以尝试更努力地和同事们互动。
[00:49:36.520] Sometimes you're the one holding yourself back from asking a random co-worker to have lunch with instead of jumping all the way to being like, okay, I should start brushing off my resume and looking for a brand new job.
[00:49:36.520] 有时候，你会因为犹豫不决而不敢邀请一位素不相识的同事共进午餐，而不是直接跳到“好吧，我应该开始修改简历，寻找一份全新的工作”的想法上。
[00:49:51.720] Yeah, on that note, it is so easy to spiral in your thoughts. And that's one of the best takeaways I had from therapy, which was how to remove myself from a situation like that when you're in a state of really intense emotions,
[00:49:51.720] 是啊，说到这一点，人很容易陷入自己的思绪漩涡中。而我从心理治疗中学到的最重要的一点就是，如何在情绪非常强烈的时候让自己从那种情境中抽身出来。
[00:50:08.200] you're not going to have the most logical thoughts. So the best thing to do for yourself is always to step away, go outside, take a walk, just catch your breath and then come back with a more sound mind and really reassess like, okay, what is the issue here?
[00:50:08.200] 你可能不会有最合乎逻辑的思考。所以，最好的办法就是暂时离开，到外面走走，喘口气，然后再冷静下来，重新审视一下，比如，好吧，问题到底出在哪里？
[00:50:24.600] Do I really need to find a new job or am I just the problem? Yeah, exactly. And you know what? Most of the time it might just be you're the problem.
[00:50:24.600] 我真的需要找份新工作吗？还是问题出在我身上？没错，就是这样。你知道吗？大多数时候，问题可能真的出在你身上。
[00:50:34.520] As like fucked up as that sounds, I feel like it's kind of a real thought to have because just comparing like finding new job versus trying a little harder to interact with people, finding new job you personally don't have to change because you're just changing your environment
[00:50:34.520] 虽然听起来有点扯淡，但我感觉这确实是个值得思考的问题。比如，找新工作和努力与人交往相比，找新工作你不需要改变自己，因为你只是换了个环境而已。
[00:50:55.480] versus like taking the steps to try a little harder to interact with people. That's like making yourself kind of grow. And then I guess if that doesn't work out, then you can figure something else out. But at least you worked on yourself first before immediately just
[00:50:55.480] 比如，尝试更努力地与人互动。这就像是让自己成长。如果这条路行不通，你还可以想别的办法。但至少你先努力提升自己，而不是立刻就……
[00:51:10.280] blaming everything else and like doing something that is very external. I think one other thing too that a lot of people don't really think about or kind of forget to realize is that you only really grow when you put yourself outside
[00:51:10.280] 把一切都归咎于其他方面，好像在做一些非常外在的事情。我觉得还有一点很多人没有真正思考过，或者说忘记了，那就是只有当你把自己置于外部环境时，你才能真正成长。
[00:51:25.080] of your comfort zone and change is very uncomfortable. That's sort of why you are able to grow a lot from changing something in your life. The sooner you realize and you acknowledge that whatever you're about to do is going
[00:51:25.080] 走出舒适区，改变总是让人非常不舒服。但正因如此，改变才能让你在生活中获得巨大的成长。你越早意识到并承认自己即将要做的事情会带来改变，就越能更好地成长。
[00:51:37.400] to make you really uncomfortable, the faster you can actually act upon it. Oh my god, that's kind of scary. New phobia unlocked. Not to make like any change like super daunting in your life, right?
[00:51:37.400] 让你感到极度不舒服，你才能更快地采取行动。我的天，这有点吓人。又解锁了一种新的恐惧症。不过，别让生活中的任何改变都变得像噩梦一样，对吧？
[00:51:51.480] It's just like it's just one of the realities that we kind of have to live with. I mean, maybe if you enact change so much, you're just used to it. And then you'll be a pro at changing.
[00:51:51.480] 这就像是我们不得不接受的现实之一。我的意思是，也许如果你经常经历改变，你就会习以为常。然后你就会成为改变的高手。
[00:52:05.960] Yeah, I mean, I know people, a lot of people who have heavy growth mindsets who I think the change doesn't bother them so much because they're more hyper focused on what about themselves they're changing.
[00:52:05.960] 是的，我的意思是，我认识很多人，他们拥有很强的成长型思维，我认为改变不会让他们感到太困扰，因为他们更专注于改变自己身上的哪些方面。
[00:52:17.880] So the fact that like what they're about to do is really uncomfortable doesn't even bother them anymore. So I think there is some level of normalcy, I guess with it if you do it a lot.
[00:52:17.880] 所以，即使他们即将要做的事情让他们感到非常不舒服，他们也已经习以为常了。我想，如果你经常做这件事，它在某种程度上就变得正常化了。
[00:52:27.480] Yeah, I think a lot of this conversation is making me realize that change feels like it's something very dramatic and something that requires a lot of planning and a lot of prep and a lot of emotional prep, of course.
[00:52:27.480] 是的，我觉得这次谈话让我意识到，改变感觉就像是一件非常剧烈的事情，需要大量的计划、准备，当然还有情感上的准备。
[00:52:40.280] But the more I talk to you both about it, the more I realize maybe a lot of change is like being in tune with yourself first. And that way you can have a smoother transition, you can be a little bit less scared of change,
[00:52:40.280] 但是我和你们俩聊得越多，我就越意识到，或许很多改变都需要先了解自己。这样才能更顺利地过渡，也能减少对改变的恐惧。
[00:52:53.320] and you can also feel when and what kind of change you actually need in your life. So it's definitely been really interesting talking to you both about it. I feel like my fear of change has like grown slightly, but I think I also understand it
[00:52:53.320] 你也能感受到自己生活中真正需要的是何时以及需要什么样的改变。所以和你们俩聊这个话题真的很有意思。我觉得我对改变的恐惧好像稍微加深了一些，但我想我也能理解这种恐惧了。
[00:53:07.080] a little bit more conceptually. So, you know, net positive. But thank you both for talking about such a big topic of transition in our lives, especially in our mid 20s. So for any of our listeners out there, if you want to hit us up about your tips and
