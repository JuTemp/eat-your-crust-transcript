[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_04]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_04]：大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。
[00:00:03.640] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm Crystal.
[00:00:03.640] [SPEAKER_04]：我是克丽丝塔尔。
[00:00:04.560] [SPEAKER_03]: And I'm Anne.
[00:00:04.560] [SPEAKER_03]：我是安妮。
[00:00:16.660] [SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, Anne. The last episode she was on was Girl Talk, Episode 131, Platonic
[00:00:16.660] [SPEAKER_02]：欢迎回来，安妮。她上次参与的节目是《闺蜜闲聊》第131集，主题是柏拉图式的友谊。
[00:00:23.480] [SPEAKER_02]: BFFs. And this week we have Anne on to talk about something that's been occupying our
[00:00:23.480] [SPEAKER_02]：闺蜜们。本周我们请到了安妮来聊聊我们最近一直在关注的事情。
[00:00:30.740] [SPEAKER_02]: minds a lot lately and really providing great entertainment value, I would say. So we wanted
[00:00:30.740] [SPEAKER_02]：最近有很多想法，而且我认为它们确实提供了很高的娱乐价值。所以我们想
[00:00:37.680] [SPEAKER_02]: to talk about the boom in Korean reality TV. And I would say this is a little different
[00:00:37.680] [SPEAKER_02]：来谈谈韩国真人秀的蓬勃发展。我想说，这有点不同。
[00:00:43.700] [SPEAKER_02]: from like Korean variety shows, which I think have always been really popular, not just
[00:00:43.700] [SPEAKER_02]：比如韩国综艺节目，我觉得这些节目一直都很受欢迎，不仅仅是
[00:00:48.580] [SPEAKER_02]: in Korea, but with a lot of K-pop and like K-drama fans. I feel like in the
[00:00:48.580] [SPEAKER_02]：在韩国，但有很多K-pop和韩剧粉丝。我觉得在
[00:00:53.500] [SPEAKER_02]: recent years, we've been seeing a lot more Korean reality TV show pop off, just
[00:00:53.500] [SPEAKER_02]：近年来，我们看到越来越多的韩国真人秀节目走红，
[00:01:00.240] [SPEAKER_02]: some examples off the top of my head, like Physical 100, Singles Inferno. So we thought
[00:01:00.240] [SPEAKER_02]：我能想到的例子有，比如《Physical 100》和《Singles Inferno》。所以我们认为
[00:01:05.980] [SPEAKER_02]: it would be fun to talk about our experiences watching these if we like them, what we like
[00:01:05.980] [SPEAKER_02]：如果我们喜欢这些电影，讨论一下观看体验会很有趣，说说我们喜欢什么。
[00:01:11.300] [SPEAKER_02]: about them and all of that.
[00:01:11.300] [SPEAKER_02]：关于他们以及所有那些事。
[00:01:13.440] [SPEAKER_03]: Sounds great.
[00:01:13.440] [SPEAKER_03]：听起来很棒。
[00:01:18.640] [SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a big enjoyer of Korean reality TV shows. I think it does stem from a love
[00:01:18.640] [SPEAKER_04]：我很喜欢看韩国真人秀节目。我觉得这源于我对它们的喜爱。
[00:01:24.980] [SPEAKER_04]: of just Korean TV and variety shows in general, from when I was young and watching
[00:01:24.980] [SPEAKER_04]：就我小时候看的韩国电视节目和综艺节目而言，就是韩国电视节目和综艺节目。
[00:01:29.180] [SPEAKER_04]: those things with my family. But now that I don't live with my parents anymore, I feel
[00:01:29.180] [SPEAKER_04]：那些和家人一起做的事情。但现在我不再和父母住在一起了，我感觉
[00:01:33.360] [SPEAKER_04]: like it helps me feel in touch with my culture still. And Korean reality TV is the
[00:01:33.360] [SPEAKER_04]：感觉它能让我继续与我的文化保持联系。而韩国真人秀节目就是……
[00:01:39.760] [SPEAKER_04]: definition of slow burn, at least in the romance world. The OSTs, they just fucking
[00:01:39.760] [SPEAKER_04]：慢热的定义，至少在爱情片领域是这样。OST，它们简直太棒了。
[00:01:44.520] [SPEAKER_04]: hit. The romance is so emotional. And there's kind of like the are they in
[00:01:44.520] [SPEAKER_04]：太棒了。这段爱情故事太感人了。而且还有那种“他们到底在干什么”的感觉。
[00:01:50.960] [SPEAKER_04]: love? Are they not? Mystery element as well that I feel like doesn't come as
[00:01:50.960] [SPEAKER_04]：爱情？难道不是吗？还有那种神秘感，我觉得它并不像……
[00:01:55.180] [SPEAKER_04]: much with American reality TV shows. So I will be watching and defending Korean
[00:01:55.180] [SPEAKER_04]：很多都是美国真人秀节目。所以我也会观看并捍卫韩国。
[00:02:01.000] [SPEAKER_04]: reality till I die.
[00:02:01.000] [SPEAKER_04]：直到我死去，我都是现实。
[00:02:03.860] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no one's gonna attack you here.
[00:02:03.860] [SPEAKER_03]：好的，这里没人会攻击你。
[00:02:08.260] [SPEAKER_02]: So do you all have a favorite one off the top of your head?
[00:02:08.260] [SPEAKER_02]：那么你们大家有没有一个特别喜欢的？
[00:02:13.340] [SPEAKER_02]: The last one I really enjoyed was Love After Divorce.
[00:02:13.340] [SPEAKER_02]：我最近很喜欢的一部是《离婚后的爱情》。
[00:02:17.300] [SPEAKER_03]: I just watched that.
[00:02:17.300] [SPEAKER_03]：我刚看完。
[00:02:18.500] [SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they recently did a season maybe like a year ago, where it was mainly
[00:02:18.500] [SPEAKER_03]：是的，他们最近做了一季，大概是一年前吧，主要是
[00:02:23.180] [SPEAKER_03]: Koreans living abroad on the show. So there's a lot of English, which was nice
[00:02:23.180] [SPEAKER_03]：节目里都是居住在海外的韩国人。所以有很多英语，这很不错。
[00:02:27.360] [SPEAKER_03]: for me because my Korean is really bad. But the premise is like these people who
[00:02:27.360] [SPEAKER_03]：对我来说，因为我的韩语真的很差。但前提就像这些人一样，
[00:02:31.580] [SPEAKER_03]: have gone through divorce are looking for like their second chance at love,
[00:02:31.580] [SPEAKER_03]：经历过离婚的人正在寻找第二次恋爱的机会，
[00:02:35.040] [SPEAKER_03]: like marriage potentially on the show. So the age range tends to be a bit
[00:02:35.040] [SPEAKER_03]：比如节目里可能会出现婚姻。所以年龄范围往往比较宽泛。
[00:02:40.060] [SPEAKER_03]: higher. And I think the emotional experiences that these people have been
[00:02:40.060] [SPEAKER_03]：更高。而且我认为这些人的情感经历是
[00:02:45.160] [SPEAKER_03]: through just a little bit deeper and like, I don't know, it was a really
[00:02:45.160] [SPEAKER_03]：再往里走一点，然后，我不知道，那真是……
[00:02:48.960] [SPEAKER_03]: shallow show for me. I thought the way they did it and like what the
[00:02:48.960] [SPEAKER_03]：对我来说，这节目太肤浅了。我觉得他们的做法和他们呈现的内容都很糟糕。
[00:02:53.320] [SPEAKER_03]: contestants themselves talked about and how they went about things was really
[00:02:53.320] [SPEAKER_03]：参赛者们自己谈到了他们如何应对比赛，这真的很……
[00:02:57.200] [SPEAKER_03]: nice. It also makes me hopeful, like if I have a failed marriage.
[00:02:57.200] [SPEAKER_03]：不错。这让我燃起了希望，就像我婚姻失败后也能看到希望一样。
[00:03:06.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so in Love After Marriage, do they just find random people on the
[00:03:06.500] [SPEAKER_02]：等等，所以《婚后恋爱》里，他们是随便找个人来约会吗？
[00:03:11.360] [SPEAKER_02]: street? Or is it like-
[00:03:11.360] [SPEAKER_02]：街道？还是像——
[00:03:12.460] [SPEAKER_02]: You have to apply.
[00:03:12.460] [SPEAKER_02]：你需要申请。
[00:03:13.420] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay. It's all these divorced people in the same house or something and
[00:03:13.420] [SPEAKER_02]：好的。好像都是些离异人士住在同一栋房子里似的。
[00:03:17.260] [SPEAKER_02]: then they're like-
[00:03:17.260] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他们就像——
[00:03:18.140] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:18.140] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，是啊。
[00:03:18.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay. I see.
[00:03:18.380] [SPEAKER_02]：好的，好的，我明白了。
[00:03:19.600] [SPEAKER_02]: Date each other.
[00:03:19.600] [SPEAKER_02]：互相约会。
[00:03:21.740] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like anytime they do reality TV, like romance reality TV with divorced
[00:03:21.740] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得他们每次做真人秀，比如离婚人士的恋爱真人秀，
[00:03:27.460] [SPEAKER_04]: people, the energy is just different because I watch I Am Solo on a weekly
[00:03:27.460] [SPEAKER_04]：各位，气氛就是不一样，因为我每周都会看《我是独行侠》。
[00:03:32.200] [SPEAKER_04]: basis and that show is also like you get six men and six women each in one
[00:03:32.200] [SPEAKER_04]：基础，而且那个节目就像是把六个男人和六个女人放在一起一样。
[00:03:37.480] [SPEAKER_04]: house for a week and have them date each other. And the seasons where
[00:03:37.480] [SPEAKER_04]：让他们在房子里住一个星期，然后让他们约会。还有那些季节目……
[00:03:41.060] [SPEAKER_04]: they're divorced, I feel like the pace of how they like talk about stuff
[00:03:41.060] [SPEAKER_04]：他们离婚了，我觉得他们谈论事情的节奏都变了。
[00:03:45.380] [SPEAKER_04]: is so fast because for like single undivorced people, I feel like they test
[00:03:45.380] [SPEAKER_04]：速度这么快，是因为对于像单身未离婚的人来说，我觉得他们是在测试
[00:03:50.380] [SPEAKER_04]: the waters a little bit and with divorced people straight out of the
[00:03:50.380] [SPEAKER_04]：水有点……而且离婚的人直接从……
[00:03:53.120] [SPEAKER_04]: gate, they're like, how many kids do you have? Like, you know, like these
[00:03:53.120] [SPEAKER_04]：在门口，他们会问，你有几个孩子？就像，你知道，就像这些
[00:03:56.180] [SPEAKER_04]: are my deal breakers. Like I don't want to waste time with you if I
[00:03:56.180] [SPEAKER_04]：这些都是我的底线。比如，如果……我不想在你身上浪费时间
[00:03:58.880] [SPEAKER_04]: could, you know, spend this time talking to other people, like blah,
[00:03:58.880] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，这段时间可以和其他人聊聊天，比如……
[00:04:01.420] [SPEAKER_04]: blah. So then I love watching it. Like it feels so much more raw and
[00:04:01.420] [SPEAKER_04]：呃。所以我就喜欢看。感觉这样更真实，而且
[00:04:05.340] [SPEAKER_04]: organic, I think.
[00:04:05.340] [SPEAKER_04]：我认为是有机的。
[00:04:06.480] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like no bullshit.
[00:04:06.480] [SPEAKER_04]：这简直一点也不扯淡。
[00:04:07.800] [SPEAKER_03]: Actually that's so fair. Yeah. And the Love After Divorce one too, like
[00:04:07.800] [SPEAKER_03]：其实这很公平。是啊。还有《离婚后的爱情》那部，就像……
[00:04:11.660] [SPEAKER_03]: big part of it was revealing new information every night. So like how many
[00:04:11.660] [SPEAKER_03]：很大一部分原因在于每晚都要公布新的信息。比如，有多少条信息？
[00:04:16.760] [SPEAKER_03]: kids, where they're from their job. And these are all factors that people
[00:04:16.760] [SPEAKER_03]：孩子，他们的出身，他们的工作。这些都是人们需要考虑的因素。
[00:04:20.340] [SPEAKER_03]: actually do care about but like don't usually bring up in like other dating
[00:04:20.340] [SPEAKER_03]：其实我很在意，但通常不会在约会中主动提起。
[00:04:24.700] [SPEAKER_03]: shows like G Suite.
[00:04:24.700] [SPEAKER_03]：显示类似 G Suite 的内容。
[00:04:26.140] [SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's more mature in these shows where there's like
[00:04:26.140] [SPEAKER_02]：你觉得这些节目更成熟吗？比如，有……
[00:04:31.060] [SPEAKER_02]: divorced people? There's less of the miscommunications and like mix ups?
[00:04:31.060] [SPEAKER_02]：离婚人士？沟通不畅和误会之类的事情会少一些？
[00:04:37.320] [SPEAKER_03]: They're just about different things I feel like. I don't know if they're
[00:04:37.320] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得它们讲的是完全不同的事情。我不知道它们是不是……
[00:04:40.880] [SPEAKER_02]: always more mature, right?
[00:04:40.880] [SPEAKER_02]：总是更成熟，对吧？
[00:04:42.740] [SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense. I guess it still has to be juicy enough to be like reality TV.
[00:04:42.740] [SPEAKER_02]：有道理。我想它还是得足够劲爆，才能像真人秀一样。
[00:04:47.340] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[00:04:47.340] [SPEAKER_02]：是的。
[00:04:48.660] [SPEAKER_02]: I think honestly, I haven't watched too many reality shows in the recent
[00:04:48.660] [SPEAKER_02]：说实话，我最近没怎么看真人秀节目。
[00:04:54.100] [SPEAKER_02]: months. But the last one I was watching was Exchange. It's also
[00:04:54.100] [SPEAKER_02]：几个月。但我最近看的是Exchange。它也是
[00:04:59.700] [SPEAKER_02]: called Transit Love. I think the English title is X Change. This one
[00:04:59.700] [SPEAKER_02]：叫《Transit Love》。我觉得英文名是《X Change》。就是这个
[00:05:04.520] [SPEAKER_02]: is like so interesting because the show basically brings on a bunch of
[00:05:04.520] [SPEAKER_02]：这节目太有意思了，因为它基本上汇集了一大堆……
[00:05:10.560] [SPEAKER_02]: ex couples and then they all live in the same house and they try to date
[00:05:10.560] [SPEAKER_02]：分手的情侣们，然后他们都住在同一屋檐下，试图约会。
[00:05:15.560] [SPEAKER_02]: each other. And you have the option of basically trying to get back together
[00:05:15.560] [SPEAKER_02]：彼此。你们可以选择尝试复合。
[00:05:20.100] [SPEAKER_02]: with the ex that you came onto the show with, or you can try to go date
[00:05:20.100] [SPEAKER_02]：你可以和你一起上节目的前任约会，或者你可以试着和他/她约会。
[00:05:24.520] [SPEAKER_02]: someone else. And it's so interesting because the exes aren't revealed in
[00:05:24.520] [SPEAKER_02]：其他人。而且这很有意思，因为前任的身份并没有在节目中透露。
[00:05:29.180] [SPEAKER_02]: the beginning. So it's almost easier to like try to date other people. But
[00:05:29.180] [SPEAKER_02]：开始。所以，尝试和其他人约会几乎更容易一些。但是
[00:05:34.720] [SPEAKER_02]: then once the exes get revealed, it's like, oh, I'm actually going after
[00:05:34.720] [SPEAKER_02]：然后一旦前任们的身份曝光，就好像，哦，我其实是要追她了。
[00:05:39.220] [SPEAKER_02]: this other girl's ex boyfriend and we're like buddies now. Like, that's a
[00:05:39.220] [SPEAKER_02]：我和另一个女孩的前男友现在关系很好，就像哥们儿一样。
[00:05:43.580] [SPEAKER_02]: little awkward. There's a lot of drama in that one. I feel like there's just
[00:05:43.580] [SPEAKER_02]：有点尴尬。那件事里有很多戏剧性。我觉得就是……
[00:05:47.420] [SPEAKER_02]: a lot of possibility because of the previous connection as well as the
[00:05:47.420] [SPEAKER_02]：由于之前的联系以及……，有很多可能性
[00:05:51.680] [SPEAKER_02]: potential new connections.
[00:05:51.680] [SPEAKER_02]：潜在的新联系。
[00:05:54.140] [SPEAKER_03]: My first take when I heard about the show was like, oh, that premise is
[00:05:54.140] [SPEAKER_03]：我听到这个节目时的第一反应是，哦，这个设定是
[00:05:58.420] [SPEAKER_03]: like just so toxic. It's like how can I create the most conflict within
[00:05:58.420] [SPEAKER_03]：简直太糟糕了。我该如何制造最大的冲突呢？
[00:06:04.680] [SPEAKER_03]: a TV show? Just throw a bunch of exes in.
[00:06:04.680] [SPEAKER_03]：一个电视节目？随便把一群前任都扔进去就行了。
[00:06:09.120] [SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy. Sometimes you just have someone really like trying to
[00:06:09.120] [SPEAKER_02]：真是太疯狂了。有时候，你会遇到一些特别喜欢尝试……
[00:06:14.300] [SPEAKER_02]: get back together with their ex, but then their ex is like trying to move
[00:06:14.300] [SPEAKER_02]：和前任复合，但前任却试图搬走
[00:06:17.980] [SPEAKER_02]: on and you're like, oh my god, this is painful to watch, lowkey.
[00:06:17.980] [SPEAKER_02]：然后你会想，哦我的天哪，这看着真让人难受。
[00:06:24.000] [SPEAKER_04]: And you get to hear the tea from both sides on why they broke up. And
[00:06:24.000] [SPEAKER_04]：你会听到双方讲述他们分手的原因。
[00:06:29.600] [SPEAKER_04]: you can also just, you know, see a lot of moments of like jealousy when
[00:06:29.600] [SPEAKER_04]：你也能看到很多嫉妒的场景，比如……
[00:06:33.860] [SPEAKER_04]: it's like, oh, maybe I don't want to even get back with my ex, but like
[00:06:33.860] [SPEAKER_04]：感觉就像，哦，也许我根本不想和前任复合，但是……
[00:06:36.880] [SPEAKER_04]: seeing him go after a different girl is like a different kind of pain.
[00:06:36.880] [SPEAKER_04]：看到他去追求别的女孩，就像是另一种痛苦。
[00:06:40.220] [SPEAKER_04]: So there's all these little elements, I think that make it really interesting.
[00:06:40.220] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我觉得正是这些小元素让它变得非常有趣。
[00:06:44.240] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. I would say the only downside of this one is that it's really long.
[00:06:44.240] [SPEAKER_02]：是的。我觉得这部片子唯一的缺点就是太长了。
[00:06:48.920] [SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I think the most popular season is like 30 episodes or
[00:06:48.920] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得最受欢迎的一季好像有30集左右。
[00:06:54.200] [SPEAKER_02]: something. It's like insanely long and each episode is like almost two
[00:06:54.200] [SPEAKER_02]：有点奇怪。它特别长，每一集都差不多有两集那么长。
[00:06:57.960] [SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[00:06:57.960] [SPEAKER_02]：小时。
[00:06:59.000] [SPEAKER_03]: How long are they in the house for?
[00:06:59.000] [SPEAKER_03]：他们会在房子里待多久？
[00:07:01.440] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's usually like, oh, exchange is pretty long, isn't it?
[00:07:01.440] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得通常情况下，交流时间会很长，不是吗？
[00:07:05.740] [SPEAKER_02]: It might be like two to three weeks. At the end, the last week, they like go
[00:07:05.740] [SPEAKER_02]：大概需要两到三周。最后一周，他们就像……
[00:07:11.820] [SPEAKER_02]: to Jeju Island together. It's pretty crazy. I think season two was the one
[00:07:11.820] [SPEAKER_02]：一起去济州岛。真是太疯狂了。我觉得第二季最精彩。
[00:07:17.400] [SPEAKER_02]: that really blew up. And then season three was the most recent season,
[00:07:17.400] [SPEAKER_02]：那件事真的闹大了。第三季是最近的一季。
[00:07:23.760] [SPEAKER_02]: which I've actually yet to finish because I was a little sad. There's this
[00:07:23.760] [SPEAKER_02]：其实我还没看完，因为我有点难过。还有这个
[00:07:28.700] [SPEAKER_02]: couple I was rooting for, but I just had this feeling that it might not work out.
[00:07:28.700] [SPEAKER_02]：我一直很支持这对情侣，但我总觉得他们可能不会有好结果。
[00:07:33.520] [SPEAKER_02]: So I lowkey just stopped watching in order to not break my heart.
[00:07:33.520] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我悄悄地停止观看，以免让自己心碎。
[00:07:41.000] [SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely worth finishing though. Dude, exchange three was going on
[00:07:41.000] [SPEAKER_04]：不过绝对值得完成。兄弟，第三次交换正在进行中。
[00:07:45.860] [SPEAKER_04]: when James and I were on our honeymoon. And one of the days we were
[00:07:45.860] [SPEAKER_04]：我和詹姆斯度蜜月的时候。有一天我们……
[00:07:49.180] [SPEAKER_04]: in Switzerland, we literally just like hold up in the room and like
[00:07:49.180] [SPEAKER_04]：在瑞士，我们真的就只是待在房间里，然后……
[00:07:51.960] [SPEAKER_04]: watch the whole episode because we were so addicted to it.
[00:07:51.960] [SPEAKER_04]：看完整集吧，因为我们太喜欢它了。
[00:07:56.000] [SPEAKER_04]: I love that. I need to watch it.
[00:07:56.000] [SPEAKER_04]：我喜欢那个。我得看看。
[00:07:59.060] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good one. The downside of this one is that it's not on
[00:07:59.060] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，这挺好的。缺点是它不在……
[00:08:03.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Netflix though. I believe it's on Viki. So it's like slightly less
[00:08:03.500] [SPEAKER_02]：不过Netflix上有。我记得Viki上也有。所以价格稍微便宜一些。
[00:08:07.600] [SPEAKER_02]: accessible.
[00:08:07.600] [SPEAKER_02]：无障碍。
[00:08:08.660] [SPEAKER_03]: There's also like Korean dramas I want to watch on Viki. So I've
[00:08:08.660] [SPEAKER_03]：Viki上也有一些我想看的韩剧。所以我……
[00:08:11.240] [SPEAKER_03]: been considering
[00:08:11.240] [SPEAKER_03]：一直在考虑
[00:08:12.000] [SPEAKER_02]: this kind of plays into another thing we were thinking about, which
[00:08:12.000] [SPEAKER_02]：这其实和我们正在考虑的另一件事有关，那就是
[00:08:15.220] [SPEAKER_02]: is maybe part of the reason why these K reality shows have been
[00:08:15.220] [SPEAKER_02]：这或许是这些韩国真人秀节目如此受欢迎的原因之一。
[00:08:20.140] [SPEAKER_02]: getting so popular is because of how easily accessible they are. Like so
[00:08:20.140] [SPEAKER_02]：之所以如此受欢迎，是因为它们很容易获得。就像这样
[00:08:25.900] [SPEAKER_02]: many are on Netflix alone. The average person I would say probably
[00:08:25.900] [SPEAKER_02]：很多人只看 Netflix。我觉得普通人大概会这样。
[00:08:30.380] [SPEAKER_02]: has access to a Netflix account is just suddenly so available to
[00:08:30.380] [SPEAKER_02]：突然间，只要能访问Netflix账号，就能随时随地联系到他们。
[00:08:34.980] [SPEAKER_02]: us. And I think honestly, in the US reality TV has been on the
[00:08:34.980] [SPEAKER_02]：我们。而且说实话，我认为在美国，真人秀节目已经……
[00:08:41.340] [SPEAKER_02]: upswing as well. Like there's been some really intense I don't
[00:08:41.340] [SPEAKER_02]：也有上涨的趋势。就像经历了一些非常强烈的……我不知道
[00:08:46.400] [SPEAKER_02]: follow these but I know like what Vanderpump rules is like
[00:08:46.400] [SPEAKER_02]：遵循这些规则，但我知道《Vanderpump Rules》是什么样的。
[00:08:49.720] [SPEAKER_02]: huge. And I feel like people are just already in that like
[00:08:49.720] [SPEAKER_02]：巨大。我觉得人们已经身处其中了。
[00:08:53.680] [SPEAKER_02]: reality TV mindset so they're ready to accept foreign reality TV too.
[00:08:53.680] [SPEAKER_02]：他们有真人秀的心态，所以他们也准备接受外国的真人秀。
[00:08:59.820] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely having it on like, on demand streaming sites
[00:08:59.820] [SPEAKER_03]：是的，肯定会在点播流媒体网站上播放。
[00:09:05.820] [SPEAKER_03]: makes it really really accessible. I feel like before I used to
[00:09:05.820] [SPEAKER_03]：这让它变得非常非常容易上手。我觉得以前我……
[00:09:09.800] [SPEAKER_03]: only see reality TV and this is like when I was a lot younger
[00:09:09.800] [SPEAKER_03]：我只看真人秀，这感觉就像我年轻的时候一样。
[00:09:13.580] [SPEAKER_03]: on actual TV channels, which I just don't have anymore. I
[00:09:13.580] [SPEAKER_03]：以前是在一些电视频道上看的，但我现在都没电视了。我
[00:09:18.200] [SPEAKER_03]: also feel like a factor is suggestion algorithms on Netflix
[00:09:18.200] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉 Netflix 的推荐算法也是一个因素。
[00:09:24.580] [SPEAKER_03]: or like whatever platform you use, you watch like Korean drama,
[00:09:24.580] [SPEAKER_03]：或者像你用的任何平台，你看韩剧之类的，
[00:09:29.260] [SPEAKER_03]: which is also already really popular, then I feel like you're
[00:09:29.260] [SPEAKER_03]：这也很受欢迎，那我觉得你
[00:09:32.020] [SPEAKER_03]: more likely to be suggested like a creative TV show. True. See
[00:09:32.020] [SPEAKER_03]：更像是创意电视节目。没错。参见
[00:09:35.940] [SPEAKER_03]: Korean people falling in love in real life. It is
[00:09:35.940] [SPEAKER_03]：韩国人在现实生活中坠入爱河。
[00:09:39.380] [SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[00:09:39.380] [SPEAKER_04]：有意思。
[00:09:40.060] [SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good point. There's also, for me
[00:09:40.060] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得你说得对。对我来说，还有一点。
[00:09:43.200] [SPEAKER_04]: personally, like just a craving to watch Asian people on
[00:09:43.200] [SPEAKER_04]：就我个人而言，就是很想看亚洲人……
[00:09:47.680] [SPEAKER_04]: reality. Like I feel like on mainstream American TV, we
[00:09:47.680] [SPEAKER_04]：现实。就像我觉得在美国主流电视节目里，我们
[00:09:51.180] [SPEAKER_04]: don't really get that. And recently there's been some
[00:09:51.180] [SPEAKER_04]：我不太明白。而且最近发生了一些……
[00:09:54.260] [SPEAKER_04]: exceptions with like The Bachelorette being Asian and
[00:09:54.260] [SPEAKER_04]：像《单身女郎》这样的节目是亚裔的例外情况
[00:09:56.880] [SPEAKER_04]: whatnot. But sometimes I just want to see like a whole like
[00:09:56.880] [SPEAKER_04]：什么的。但有时候我只想看到一个完整的……
[00:09:59.660] [SPEAKER_04]: TV show about Asians. And really the easiest way to
[00:09:59.660] [SPEAKER_04]：一部关于亚洲人的电视剧。而且这真的是最简单的方法
[00:10:03.860] [SPEAKER_04]: find that is in Asian TV shows. So then I think the
[00:10:03.860] [SPEAKER_04]：我发现亚洲电视节目里有这种现象。所以我觉得
[00:10:07.760] [SPEAKER_04]: element of the foreign cultures to also bring an
[00:10:07.760] [SPEAKER_04]：外国文化元素也带来了一种
[00:10:11.680] [SPEAKER_04]: interesting element to the show, where it's not just
[00:10:11.680] [SPEAKER_04]：这个节目有趣的地方在于，它不仅仅是
[00:10:14.540] [SPEAKER_04]: fast paced drama, it's sometimes slow burn and you
[00:10:14.540] [SPEAKER_04]：节奏很快的剧情，有时节奏比较慢，而且你
[00:10:18.020] [SPEAKER_04]: know, emotional and there's like a narrative to the story
[00:10:18.020] [SPEAKER_04]：我知道，这很感人，而且这个故事还有叙事性。
[00:10:21.360] [SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[00:10:21.360] [SPEAKER_02]：也是。
[00:10:22.560] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true. I want to see reality TV where people take
[00:10:22.560] [SPEAKER_02]：没错。我想看真人秀，人们在节目中展现自己。
[00:10:25.340] [SPEAKER_02]: their shoes off before going in the house.
[00:10:25.340] [SPEAKER_02]：进屋前要脱鞋。
[00:10:28.660] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:28.660] [SPEAKER_03]：是的，没错。
[00:10:30.300] [SPEAKER_03]: This is why I was so into Terrace House because I feel
[00:10:30.300] [SPEAKER_03]：这就是我为什么那么喜欢《双层公寓》的原因，因为我觉得
[00:10:33.220] [SPEAKER_03]: like for me that was the first show where I was like,
[00:10:33.220] [SPEAKER_03]：对我来说，那是我第一次看节目时感觉，
[00:10:35.720] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, this is how I would actually approach romance or
[00:10:35.720] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，这才是我真正对待恋爱的方式，或者
[00:10:38.460] [SPEAKER_03]: living with people. I wouldn't just immediately try to like
[00:10:38.460] [SPEAKER_03]：和别人一起生活。我不会立刻就试图喜欢上别人。
[00:10:40.800] [SPEAKER_03]: someone for night one.
[00:10:40.800] [SPEAKER_03]：有人来陪我过夜吗？
[00:10:44.140] [SPEAKER_03]: The slow burn, the things that they get upset about.
[00:10:44.140] [SPEAKER_03]：慢慢地，他们会为此生气的事情。
[00:10:48.520] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little different.
[00:10:48.520] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉有点不一样。
[00:10:50.300] [SPEAKER_04]: True. And I feel like with that too, I feel like the
[00:10:50.300] [SPEAKER_04]：没错。而且我觉得，就这一点而言，我觉得
[00:10:53.840] [SPEAKER_04]: controversies that the shows start also are a little
[00:10:53.840] [SPEAKER_04]：这些节目引发的争议也有些
[00:10:56.800] [SPEAKER_04]: bit different. Something that I thought was so funny
[00:10:56.800] [SPEAKER_04]：有点不一样。我觉得这很有趣
[00:11:00.080] [SPEAKER_04]: watching Exchange or Transit Love was one of the main
[00:11:00.080] [SPEAKER_04]：观看《交换》或《过境爱情》是主要原因之一。
[00:11:03.960] [SPEAKER_04]: controversies was that they were like gross, as in they
[00:11:03.960] [SPEAKER_04]：争议在于它们很恶心，就像它们
[00:11:08.780] [SPEAKER_04]: did not tidy the house.
[00:11:08.780] [SPEAKER_04]：没有打扫房子。
[00:11:10.660] [SPEAKER_04]: So then often they would stay up late and like drink
[00:11:10.660] [SPEAKER_04]：所以他们经常熬夜喝酒。
[00:11:12.980] [SPEAKER_04]: and there's like Anju and like food and stuff and
[00:11:12.980] [SPEAKER_04]：还有安珠，还有食物之类的，
[00:11:16.220] [SPEAKER_04]: they would go to sleep at like 6 a.m. or something.
[00:11:16.220] [SPEAKER_04]：他们大概早上六点左右就睡觉了。
[00:11:18.440] [SPEAKER_04]: So then naturally they leave all the mess on the
[00:11:18.440] [SPEAKER_04]：所以很自然地，他们就把所有的烂摊子都留在了……
[00:11:20.980] [SPEAKER_04]: tables. And then people in Korea got so mad and
[00:11:20.980] [SPEAKER_04]：桌子。然后韩国人就非常生气了，
[00:11:24.020] [SPEAKER_04]: were like, oh my God, these people are fucking
[00:11:24.020] [SPEAKER_04]：当时我们就想，我的天哪，这些人真是他妈的
[00:11:25.480] [SPEAKER_04]: living in filth. Like this is unacceptable.
[00:11:25.480] [SPEAKER_04]：生活在肮脏的环境中。这简直令人无法接受。
[00:11:29.000] [SPEAKER_02]: I think that was season two, right?
[00:11:29.000] [SPEAKER_02]：我想那是第二季，对吧？
[00:11:30.660] [SPEAKER_02]: I think I also heard like all the plants in the
[00:11:30.660] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我还听到了所有植物的声音……
[00:11:34.160] [SPEAKER_02]: house they rented for the show died and people
[00:11:34.160] [SPEAKER_02]：他们租来做节目的房子死了，人们
[00:11:37.120] [SPEAKER_02]: were like, dude, what the fuck?
[00:11:37.120] [SPEAKER_02]：我们当时就想，老兄，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:11:41.000] [SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny.
[00:11:41.000] [SPEAKER_04]：太搞笑了。
[00:11:42.500] [SPEAKER_04]: In My Sibling Romance, which was one of my recent
[00:11:42.500] [SPEAKER_04]：在我的《兄妹恋情》中，这是我最近读过的一本书。
[00:11:45.140] [SPEAKER_04]: faves, there was a contestant who for some
[00:11:45.140] [SPEAKER_04]：我最喜欢的选手之一，有一位选手因为某些原因……
[00:11:48.920] [SPEAKER_04]: reason she was never pictured doing the dishes.
[00:11:48.920] [SPEAKER_04]：这就是她从未被拍到洗碗的原因。
[00:11:51.960] [SPEAKER_04]: And then people started being like, oh my God,
[00:11:51.960] [SPEAKER_04]：然后人们就开始说，哦我的天哪，
[00:11:54.940] [SPEAKER_04]: you can tell she's like a horrible person and
[00:11:54.940] [SPEAKER_04]：看得出来她是个很糟糕的人，
[00:11:57.760] [SPEAKER_04]: she has no rapport with any of the girls.
[00:11:57.760] [SPEAKER_04]：她和所有女孩都没有交情。
[00:12:00.080] [SPEAKER_04]: You can see that she has no social skills because
[00:12:00.080] [SPEAKER_04]：你可以看出她缺乏社交技巧，因为
[00:12:01.940] [SPEAKER_04]: look, she doesn't even do the dishes.
[00:12:01.940] [SPEAKER_04]：你看，她连碗都不洗。
[00:12:03.380] [SPEAKER_04]: And then after that controversy happened, the
[00:12:03.380] [SPEAKER_04]：然后，在那场争议发生之后，
[00:12:05.820] [SPEAKER_04]: literal episode that aired after the producers
[00:12:05.820] [SPEAKER_04]：字面意义上的剧集，在制作人之后播出。
[00:12:08.640] [SPEAKER_04]: edited in purposefully a clip of her doing the
[00:12:08.640] [SPEAKER_04]：故意剪辑了一段她做……的片段
[00:12:12.100] [SPEAKER_04]: dishes and clips of her talking to girls.
[00:12:12.100] [SPEAKER_04]: 菜肴和她与女孩们交谈的片段。
[00:12:14.720] [SPEAKER_04]: It's be like, oh, you know, we just didn't have
[00:12:14.720] [SPEAKER_04]：就好像，哦，你知道，我们只是没有
[00:12:16.780] [SPEAKER_04]: time to put it in the show, but she's like a
[00:12:16.780] [SPEAKER_04]：是时候把这个放进节目里了，但她就像……
[00:12:18.780] [SPEAKER_04]: normal person, guys.
[00:12:18.780] [SPEAKER_04]：伙计们，我就是正常人。
[00:12:20.360] [SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a huge thing.
[00:12:20.360] [SPEAKER_03]：不，那可是件大事。
[00:12:22.220] [SPEAKER_03]: You're watching an hour episode for a show and
[00:12:22.220] [SPEAKER_03]：你正在观看一集时长一小时的节目，
[00:12:25.320] [SPEAKER_03]: it's covering so much time.
[00:12:25.320] [SPEAKER_03]：它占用了太多时间。
[00:12:27.920] [SPEAKER_03]: You really don't know what happened.
[00:12:27.920] [SPEAKER_03]：你真的不知道发生了什么。
[00:12:29.920] [SPEAKER_03]: So then the narrative is actually created by
[00:12:29.920] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，叙事实际上是由……创造的。
[00:12:32.400] [SPEAKER_03]: whoever's editing and directing the show.
[00:12:32.400] [SPEAKER_03]：负责剪辑和导演节目的人。
[00:12:35.160] [SPEAKER_03]: If you like dislike someone, it's because
[00:12:35.160] [SPEAKER_03]：如果你喜欢或不喜欢某人，那是因为
[00:12:37.320] [SPEAKER_03]: they're making you dislike them.
[00:12:37.320] [SPEAKER_03]：他们让你讨厌他们。
[00:12:39.740] [SPEAKER_03]: True.
[00:12:39.740] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:12:40.720] [SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I can have like strong emotions
[00:12:40.720] [SPEAKER_03]：有时候我会有很强烈的情绪。
[00:12:42.620] [SPEAKER_03]: about characters on these shows.
[00:12:42.620] [SPEAKER_03]：关于这些节目中的角色。
[00:12:44.380] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, that girl is such a bitch.
[00:12:44.380] [SPEAKER_03]：我就想，哦，那个女孩真是个贱人。
[00:12:48.020] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like, she's so snaky, whatever.
[00:12:48.020] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，她真是个阴险狡诈的人，随便吧。
[00:12:50.960] [SPEAKER_03]: But really we only, we don't see everything.
[00:12:50.960] [SPEAKER_03]：但实际上我们只能看到，我们不可能看到一切。
[00:12:53.600] [SPEAKER_03]: Good reminder.
[00:12:53.600] [SPEAKER_03]：提醒得好。
[00:12:55.220] [SPEAKER_02]: They're people.
[00:12:55.220] [SPEAKER_02]：他们也是人。
[00:12:56.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[00:12:56.880] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天哪。
[00:12:57.320] [SPEAKER_02]: Also, Jisoo, I think you need to explain
[00:12:57.320] [SPEAKER_02]：还有，Jisoo，我觉得你需要解释一下
[00:12:59.740] [SPEAKER_02]: my sibling romance a little or else it's just
[00:12:59.740] [SPEAKER_02]：我兄弟姐妹之间有点儿浪漫，不然就只是……
[00:13:02.940] [SPEAKER_02]: the title.
[00:13:02.940] [SPEAKER_02]：标题。
[00:13:03.900] [SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like incest.
[00:13:03.900] [SPEAKER_02]：听起来像是乱伦。
[00:13:06.060] [SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound like what it actually is.
[00:13:06.060] [SPEAKER_02]：听起来不像它实际的样子。
[00:13:11.180] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[00:13:11.180] [SPEAKER_04]：好的。
[00:13:12.280] [SPEAKER_04]: So my sibling romance is first of all, a
[00:13:12.280] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我的兄妹恋情首先是……
[00:13:15.220] [SPEAKER_04]: show that everyone should watch because it
[00:13:15.220] [SPEAKER_04]：表明每个人都应该观看，因为它
[00:13:17.600] [SPEAKER_04]: will warm your hearts.
[00:13:17.600] [SPEAKER_04]：会温暖你的心。
[00:13:19.560] [SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically a similar element to
[00:13:19.560] [SPEAKER_04]：但它基本上与以下元素类似：
[00:13:22.880] [SPEAKER_04]: exchange, but instead of exes, it's
[00:13:22.880] [SPEAKER_04]：交换，但不是前任，而是……
[00:13:25.480] [SPEAKER_04]: siblings and the siblings have to be
[00:13:25.480] [SPEAKER_04]：兄弟姐妹，而且兄弟姐妹必须是
[00:13:27.560] [SPEAKER_04]: opposite gender, but there's no rules on
[00:13:27.560] [SPEAKER_04]：异性，但没有相关规定
[00:13:29.700] [SPEAKER_04]: like age gap.
[00:13:29.700] [SPEAKER_04]：比如年龄差距。
[00:13:30.320] [SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes you'll see like a really big
[00:13:30.320] [SPEAKER_04]：所以有时候你会看到一个非常大的
[00:13:32.080] [SPEAKER_04]: age gap between the siblings and whatnot.
[00:13:32.080] [SPEAKER_04]：兄弟姐妹之间的年龄差距等等。
[00:13:33.840] [SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because now that you
[00:13:33.840] [SPEAKER_04]：这很有意思，因为现在你
[00:13:36.340] [SPEAKER_04]: have all the siblings living in one house,
[00:13:36.340] [SPEAKER_04]：让所有兄弟姐妹都住在同一屋檐下，
[00:13:38.780] [SPEAKER_04]: when you try to date each other,
[00:13:38.780] [SPEAKER_04]：当你们尝试约会时，
[00:13:40.280] [SPEAKER_04]: there's these weird things of like, oh,
[00:13:40.280] [SPEAKER_04]：有些事情很奇怪，比如，哦，
[00:13:42.820] [SPEAKER_04]: I want that guy to be like dating my
[00:13:42.820] [SPEAKER_04]：我希望那个人能和我约会。
[00:13:45.760] [SPEAKER_04]: sister.
[00:13:45.760] [SPEAKER_04]：姐姐。
[00:13:46.060] [SPEAKER_04]: Like he's cool.
[00:13:46.060] [SPEAKER_04]：他看起来很酷。
[00:13:46.860] [SPEAKER_04]: I want him as my brother-in-law or
[00:13:46.860] [SPEAKER_04]：我希望他做我的姐夫或
[00:13:49.340] [SPEAKER_04]: the opposite of like, yeah, like my
[00:13:49.340] [SPEAKER_04]：跟“喜欢”相反，是的，就像我的
[00:13:52.100] [SPEAKER_04]: brother is talking to this girl, but
[00:13:52.100] [SPEAKER_04]：哥哥正在和这个女孩说话，但是
[00:13:53.660] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I really like her
[00:13:53.660] [SPEAKER_04]：我不知道我是否真的喜欢她。
[00:13:55.020] [SPEAKER_04]: that much.
[00:13:55.020] [SPEAKER_04]：就这么多。
[00:13:56.180] [SPEAKER_04]: So like then the girl has to impress

[00:18:10.500] [SPEAKER_02]: I think women definitely
[00:18:10.500] [SPEAKER_02]：我认为女性肯定
[00:18:11.980] [SPEAKER_02]: have less forgiving standards.
[00:18:11.980] [SPEAKER_02]：要有更严格的标准。
[00:18:15.120] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like scandals or

[00:18:16.300] [SPEAKER_02]: or just like reactions,
[00:18:16.300] [SPEAKER_02]：或者就像反应一样，
[00:18:17.580] [SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's so interesting.
[00:18:17.580] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得这很有趣。
[00:18:19.940] [SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we've talked about this
[00:18:19.940] [SPEAKER_02]：或许我们已经讨论过这个问题了。
[00:18:21.700] [SPEAKER_02]: before on another episode where
[00:18:21.700] [SPEAKER_02]：之前在另一集里
[00:18:23.320] [SPEAKER_02]: like there's almost this cycle
[00:18:23.320] [SPEAKER_02]：就像几乎存在这样一个循环
[00:18:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]: of like, you know, this person
[00:18:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]：就像，你知道，这个人
[00:18:26.460] [SPEAKER_02]: gets really popular and then
[00:18:26.460] [SPEAKER_02]：变得非常受欢迎，然后
[00:18:28.000] [SPEAKER_02]: now it's cool to hate on them.
[00:18:28.000] [SPEAKER_02]：现在讨厌他们很酷。
[00:18:29.620] [SPEAKER_02]: So then they like lose
[00:18:29.620] [SPEAKER_02]：所以他们就输了
[00:18:31.580] [SPEAKER_02]: their popularity.
[00:18:31.580] [SPEAKER_02]：他们的受欢迎程度。
[00:18:32.640] [SPEAKER_02]: But then maybe a few years later
[00:18:32.640] [SPEAKER_02]：但也许几年后
[00:18:34.600] [SPEAKER_02]: they have like a like a rebirth,
[00:18:34.600] [SPEAKER_02]：他们就像经历了一次重生，
[00:18:36.760] [SPEAKER_02]: I guess in the in the media.
[00:18:36.760] [SPEAKER_02]：我想是在媒体上。
[00:18:39.520] [SPEAKER_02]: But it feels like for a woman
[00:18:39.520] [SPEAKER_02]：但感觉对一个女人来说，这就像……
[00:18:41.640] [SPEAKER_02]: that's like a longer cycle
[00:18:41.640] [SPEAKER_02]：那就像一个更长的周期
[00:18:43.420] [SPEAKER_02]: versus for men.
[00:18:43.420] [SPEAKER_02]：与男性相比。
[00:18:45.100] [SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, OK,
[00:18:45.100] [SPEAKER_02]：就好像，好吧，
[00:18:46.560] [SPEAKER_02]: we're going to hate on him
[00:18:46.560] [SPEAKER_02]：我们会讨厌他
[00:18:47.340] [SPEAKER_02]: for like a week and then
[00:18:47.340] [SPEAKER_02]：大概持续了一个星期，然后
[00:18:48.640] [SPEAKER_02]: whatever. That's cool.
[00:18:48.640] [SPEAKER_02]：随便吧。没关系。
[00:18:49.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Like whatever next project
[00:18:49.500] [SPEAKER_02]：就像下一个项目一样
[00:18:51.300] [SPEAKER_02]: they're doing.
[00:18:51.300] [SPEAKER_02]：他们正在这样做。
[00:18:52.260] [SPEAKER_02]: We love it.
[00:18:52.260] [SPEAKER_02]：我们很喜欢。
[00:18:53.240] [SPEAKER_03]: But also going back to
[00:18:53.240] [SPEAKER_03]：但也要回到
[00:18:56.320] [SPEAKER_03]: Singles Inferno,
[00:18:56.320] [SPEAKER_03]: Singles Inferno，
[00:18:58.440] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like because it was also
[00:18:58.440] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得是因为这也是
[00:19:00.540] [SPEAKER_03]: such a shock because
[00:19:00.540] [SPEAKER_03]：真是令人震惊，因为
[00:19:02.360] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like in general
[00:19:02.360] [SPEAKER_03]：我感觉一般来说
[00:19:04.480] [SPEAKER_03]: Korean TV shows are like
[00:19:04.480] [SPEAKER_03]：韩剧就像
[00:19:06.860] [SPEAKER_03]: focused on like the hot
[00:19:06.860] [SPEAKER_03]：专注于像热一样
[00:19:08.220] [SPEAKER_03]: and like scandalous
[00:19:08.220] [SPEAKER_03]：就像丑闻一样
[00:19:09.320] [SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[00:19:09.320] [SPEAKER_03]：诸如此类的事情。
[00:19:10.300] [SPEAKER_03]: So for a Korean reality
[00:19:10.300] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，对于韩国的现实而言
[00:19:12.100] [SPEAKER_03]: TV show to like show
[00:19:12.100] [SPEAKER_03]：想看的电视节目
[00:19:13.780] [SPEAKER_03]: like bikinis, any sort of
[00:19:13.780] [SPEAKER_03]：比如比基尼，任何类型的
[00:19:16.320] [SPEAKER_03]: if I like them because they're
[00:19:16.320] [SPEAKER_03]：如果我喜欢他们是因为他们
[00:19:17.440] [SPEAKER_03]: like hot or like I think
[00:19:17.440] [SPEAKER_03]：就像热一样，或者像我想的那样
[00:19:18.820] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm the shit.
[00:19:18.820] [SPEAKER_03]：我牛逼得很。
[00:19:19.420] [SPEAKER_03]: It's very different.
[00:19:19.420] [SPEAKER_03]：这完全不同。
[00:19:20.840] [SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it a lot more
[00:19:20.840] [SPEAKER_03]：所以这让它变得更加……
[00:19:21.880] [SPEAKER_03]: fun to watch.
[00:19:21.880] [SPEAKER_03]：看着很有趣。
[00:19:23.240] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[00:19:23.240] [SPEAKER_02]：没错。
[00:19:24.220] [SPEAKER_02]: Like by Korean standards,
[00:19:24.220] [SPEAKER_02]：按照韩国的标准来看，
[00:19:25.200] [SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty scandalous.
[00:19:25.200] [SPEAKER_02]：这太令人震惊了。
[00:19:26.600] [SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of spicy.
[00:19:26.600] [SPEAKER_02]：有点辣。
[00:19:27.680] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[00:19:27.680] [SPEAKER_02]：是的。
[00:19:28.340] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're going to get a hotel
[00:19:28.340] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，他们要去住酒店了。
[00:19:29.440] [SPEAKER_03]: room together.
[00:19:29.440] [SPEAKER_03]：一起住一个房间。
[00:19:31.920] [SPEAKER_04]: I think if you watch something
[00:19:31.920] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得如果你看一些
[00:19:33.240] [SPEAKER_04]: like Heart Signal,
[00:19:33.240] [SPEAKER_04]：就像心跳信号一样，
[00:19:34.380] [SPEAKER_04]: which to me is like
[00:19:34.380] [SPEAKER_04]：对我来说就像
[00:19:35.560] [SPEAKER_04]: peak wholesome,
[00:19:35.560] [SPEAKER_04]: 极致的健康，
[00:19:36.840] [SPEAKER_04]: you can really tell the
[00:19:36.840] [SPEAKER_04]：你真的能分辨出来
[00:19:38.120] [SPEAKER_04]: difference between like
[00:19:38.120] [SPEAKER_04]：像之间的区别
[00:19:39.140] [SPEAKER_04]: the average expectations
[00:19:39.140] [SPEAKER_04]：平均预期
[00:19:40.760] [SPEAKER_04]: for a Korean romance show
[00:19:40.760] [SPEAKER_04]：为了一个韩国爱情节目
[00:19:42.440] [SPEAKER_04]: versus like Singles Inferno.
[00:19:42.440] [SPEAKER_04]：类似于 Singles Inferno。
[00:19:44.360] [SPEAKER_04]: But I remember being disappointed
[00:19:44.360] [SPEAKER_04]：但我记得当时很失望
[00:19:46.260] [SPEAKER_04]: because the trailers
[00:19:46.260] [SPEAKER_04]：因为预告片
[00:19:47.140] [SPEAKER_04]: for Singles Inferno
[00:19:47.140] [SPEAKER_04]：单身地狱
[00:19:48.140] [SPEAKER_04]: were so spicy.
[00:19:48.140] [SPEAKER_04]：太辣了。
[00:19:49.160] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I watched the actual
[00:19:49.160] [SPEAKER_04]：然后我看了实际的
[00:19:50.200] [SPEAKER_04]: show and I was like,
[00:19:50.200] [SPEAKER_04]：演出的时候我就想，
[00:19:51.080] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's not really that
[00:19:51.080] [SPEAKER_04]：我想其实并非如此。
[00:19:52.560] [SPEAKER_04]: spicy, except they're just
[00:19:52.560] [SPEAKER_04]：很辣，但他们只是
[00:19:54.080] [SPEAKER_04]: in bikinis.
[00:19:54.080] [SPEAKER_04]：穿着比基尼。
[00:19:54.860] [SPEAKER_04]: And that's like the cultural
[00:19:54.860] [SPEAKER_04]：这就像是文化
[00:19:55.960] [SPEAKER_04]: shock.
[00:19:55.960] [SPEAKER_04]：震惊。
[00:19:56.940] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I remember
[00:19:56.940] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，我想我记得
[00:19:58.040] [SPEAKER_02]: watching it.
[00:19:58.040] [SPEAKER_02]：正在观看。
[00:19:58.740] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh my God,
[00:19:58.740] [SPEAKER_02]：我当时就想，我的天哪，
[00:19:59.780] [SPEAKER_02]: like they're going to these
[00:19:59.780] [SPEAKER_02]：就像他们要去这些地方一样
[00:20:00.940] [SPEAKER_02]: hotel rooms for a night.
[00:20:00.940] [SPEAKER_02]：酒店房间住一晚。
[00:20:02.640] [SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, wait,
[00:20:02.640] [SPEAKER_02]：然后我就想，等等，
[00:20:03.500] [SPEAKER_02]: they're literally just like
[00:20:03.500] [SPEAKER_02]：它们简直就像……
[00:20:04.460] [SPEAKER_02]: eating dinner and chatting.
[00:20:04.460] [SPEAKER_02]：边吃晚饭边聊天。
[00:20:07.100] [SPEAKER_03]: I did feel like they were
[00:20:07.100] [SPEAKER_03]：我确实觉得他们是
[00:20:08.840] [SPEAKER_03]: more direct, though,
[00:20:08.840] [SPEAKER_03]：不过，更直接一点，
[00:20:10.380] [SPEAKER_03]: on that show.
[00:20:10.380] [SPEAKER_03]：在那个节目里。
[00:20:11.180] [SPEAKER_03]: They tried to like show
[00:20:11.180] [SPEAKER_03]：他们试图喜欢这个节目
[00:20:12.560] [SPEAKER_03]: interest.
[00:20:12.560] [SPEAKER_03]：兴趣。
[00:20:13.640] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think this is another
[00:20:13.640] [SPEAKER_02]：但我认为这是另一个
[00:20:15.100] [SPEAKER_02]: aspect of Korean reality
[00:20:15.100] [SPEAKER_02]：韩国现实的一个方面
[00:20:17.340] [SPEAKER_02]: TV that is like so interesting.
[00:20:17.340] [SPEAKER_02]：这电视节目真有意思。
[00:20:20.200] [SPEAKER_02]: There's like no physical
[00:20:20.200] [SPEAKER_02]：几乎没有任何物理上的
[00:20:23.400] [SPEAKER_02]: touch, I guess.
[00:20:23.400] [SPEAKER_02]：我想是触摸吧。
[00:20:24.720] [SPEAKER_02]: People don't make out.
[00:20:24.720] [SPEAKER_02]：人们不会亲热。
[00:20:25.700] [SPEAKER_02]: People don't have sex.
[00:20:25.700] [SPEAKER_02]：人们不发生性行为。
[00:20:27.160] [SPEAKER_02]: They just like talk
[00:20:27.160] [SPEAKER_02]：他们就喜欢聊天
[00:20:28.620] [SPEAKER_02]: and they go on dates
[00:20:28.620] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他们就去约会了
[00:20:29.760] [SPEAKER_02]: where they like eat and talk.
[00:20:29.760] [SPEAKER_02]：他们喜欢在那里吃饭和聊天。
[00:20:31.800] [SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they'll do like
[00:20:31.800] [SPEAKER_02]：也许他们会这样做
[00:20:33.140] [SPEAKER_02]: a cute activity together.
[00:20:33.140] [SPEAKER_02]：一起做个可爱的活动。
[00:20:34.500] [SPEAKER_02]: But it's just like it's so
[00:20:34.500] [SPEAKER_02]：但感觉就像是这样
[00:20:36.700] [SPEAKER_02]: PG, if anything.
[00:20:36.700] [SPEAKER_02]：PG级，如果非要说的话。
[00:20:39.020] [SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that adds
[00:20:39.020] [SPEAKER_02]：我想这又增加了
[00:20:40.000] [SPEAKER_02]: to the whole thing
[00:20:40.000] [SPEAKER_02]：对整个事情
[00:20:40.720] [SPEAKER_02]: that you're saying, Jisoo,
[00:20:40.720] [SPEAKER_02]：你说的是，Jisoo，
[00:20:41.800] [SPEAKER_02]: where it's like slow burn.
[00:20:41.800] [SPEAKER_02]：就像慢火烹煮一样。
[00:20:43.900] [SPEAKER_02]: I guess like maybe
[00:20:43.900] [SPEAKER_02]：我猜大概是这样吧
[00:20:44.880] [SPEAKER_02]: it builds more mystery
[00:20:44.880] [SPEAKER_02]：这增添了更多神秘感。
[00:20:47.080] [SPEAKER_02]: and like suspense.
[00:20:47.080] [SPEAKER_02]：就像悬念一样。
[00:20:48.200] [SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's just
[00:20:48.200] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得那只是
[00:20:49.420] [SPEAKER_02]: something that we don't get
[00:20:49.420] [SPEAKER_02]：我们不明白的事情
[00:20:50.920] [SPEAKER_02]: as much or like a different
[00:20:50.920] [SPEAKER_02]：就像或像另一种不同
[00:20:52.540] [SPEAKER_02]: type of in like US reality
[00:20:52.540] [SPEAKER_02]：就像美国现实中的那种类型
[00:20:54.420] [SPEAKER_02]: TV.
[00:20:54.420] [SPEAKER_02]：电视。
[00:20:55.640] [SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely like a change
[00:20:55.640] [SPEAKER_02]：这确实是一种改变。
[00:20:57.140] [SPEAKER_02]: in pace and very like
[00:20:57.140] [SPEAKER_02]：节奏和非常像
[00:20:58.800] [SPEAKER_02]: interesting to follow along in.
[00:20:58.800] [SPEAKER_02]：很有意思，值得关注。
[00:21:01.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I actually wonder like how much
[00:21:01.600] [SPEAKER_04]：我其实想知道有多少
[00:21:03.280] [SPEAKER_04]: of that is stemming from
[00:21:03.280] [SPEAKER_04]：这源于
[00:21:05.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Korean like TV restrictions,
[00:21:05.900] [SPEAKER_04]：韩国人喜欢限制电视，
[00:21:08.420] [SPEAKER_04]: because sometimes in Korea
[00:21:08.420] [SPEAKER_04]：因为有时在韩国
[00:21:10.300] [SPEAKER_04]: you'll hear people say
[00:21:10.300] [SPEAKER_04]：你会听到人们说
[00:21:11.320] [SPEAKER_04]: like they can do that
[00:21:11.320] [SPEAKER_04]：就像他们能那样做一样
[00:21:12.500] [SPEAKER_04]: because they're on like
[00:21:12.500] [SPEAKER_04]：因为他们就像……
[00:21:14.020] [SPEAKER_04]: a cable platform or like
[00:21:14.020] [SPEAKER_04]：电缆平台或类似物
[00:21:15.820] [SPEAKER_04]: they're on like YouTube
[00:21:15.820] [SPEAKER_04]：它们在YouTube之类的网站上。
[00:21:16.580] [SPEAKER_04]: or something.
[00:21:16.580] [SPEAKER_04]：或者别的什么。
[00:21:17.440] [SPEAKER_04]: But if you're on one of the
[00:21:17.440] [SPEAKER_04]：但是如果你在其中一个
[00:21:18.920] [SPEAKER_04]: like major channels,
[00:21:18.920] [SPEAKER_04]：就像主要频道一样，
[00:21:20.160] [SPEAKER_04]: there's things that you
[00:21:20.160] [SPEAKER_04]：有些事情你
[00:21:21.460] [SPEAKER_04]: can't like show.
[00:21:21.460] [SPEAKER_04]：不能点赞。
[00:21:22.520] [SPEAKER_04]: For example, you have to like
[00:21:22.520] [SPEAKER_04]：例如，你必须喜欢
[00:21:23.460] [SPEAKER_04]: bleep out cuss words.
[00:21:23.460] [SPEAKER_04]：请屏蔽脏话。
[00:21:24.300] [SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not that different
[00:21:24.300] [SPEAKER_04]：好像没什么区别。
[00:21:25.440] [SPEAKER_04]: from America, but it's probably
[00:21:25.440] [SPEAKER_04]：来自美国，但很可能
[00:21:26.780] [SPEAKER_04]: a little bit stricter in Korea
[00:21:26.780] [SPEAKER_04]：韩国那边稍微严格一些。
[00:21:28.200] [SPEAKER_04]: because I did watch
[00:21:28.200] [SPEAKER_04]：因为我确实看过
[00:21:30.840] [SPEAKER_04]: a couple of episodes of this
[00:21:30.840] [SPEAKER_04]：这几集
[00:21:32.540] [SPEAKER_04]: Korean reality TV show
[00:21:32.540] [SPEAKER_04]：韩国真人秀节目
[00:21:34.100] [SPEAKER_04]: where the premise was like
[00:21:34.100] [SPEAKER_04]：前提是这样的
[00:21:36.140] [SPEAKER_04]: if you match on a date,
[00:21:36.140] [SPEAKER_04]：如果你们约会成功，
[00:21:38.280] [SPEAKER_04]: you like have to stay
[00:21:38.280] [SPEAKER_04]：你喜欢就得留下来

[00:21:40.180] [SPEAKER_04]：共度良宵。
[00:21:41.160] [SPEAKER_04]: You sleep on the same bed
[00:21:41.160] [SPEAKER_04]：你们睡在同一张床上
[00:21:42.980] [SPEAKER_04]: and the whole premise is
[00:21:42.980] [SPEAKER_04]：整个前提是
[00:21:44.020] [SPEAKER_04]: like you only know someone
[00:21:44.020] [SPEAKER_04]：就像你只认识某人一样
[00:21:45.200] [SPEAKER_04]: once you share a bed with them.
[00:21:45.200] [SPEAKER_04]：一旦你和他们同床共枕。
[00:21:46.620] [SPEAKER_04]: And I've watched a couple
[00:21:46.620] [SPEAKER_04]：我也看过几个
[00:21:47.560] [SPEAKER_04]: episodes of that.
[00:21:47.560] [SPEAKER_04]：那一集。
[00:21:48.300] [SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like,
[00:21:48.300] [SPEAKER_04]：我当时就想，
[00:21:49.400] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, this is like
[00:21:49.400] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，这就像
[00:21:50.140] [SPEAKER_04]: not what I'm looking for
[00:21:50.140] [SPEAKER_04]：这不是我想要的
[00:21:51.080] [SPEAKER_04]: right now in a TV show.
[00:21:51.080] [SPEAKER_04]：现在正在电视节目中。
[00:21:53.200] [SPEAKER_04]: But it's crazy that
[00:21:53.200] [SPEAKER_04]：但令人难以置信的是
[00:21:54.180] [SPEAKER_04]: this exists somewhere.
[00:21:54.180] [SPEAKER_04]：这东西在某个地方存在。
[00:21:55.680] [SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[00:21:55.680] [SPEAKER_03]：哇。
[00:21:56.980] [SPEAKER_03]: I always thought it was like
[00:21:56.980] [SPEAKER_03]：我一直觉得就像
[00:21:58.100] [SPEAKER_03]: due to public perception,
[00:21:58.100] [SPEAKER_03]：由于公众的看法，
[00:21:59.400] [SPEAKER_03]: potentially.
[00:21:59.400] [SPEAKER_03]：有可能。
[00:22:00.660] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this
[00:22:00.660] [SPEAKER_03]：我不知道这是否
[00:22:01.340] [SPEAKER_03]: is still the case,
[00:22:01.340] [SPEAKER_03]：情况依然如此，
[00:22:02.000] [SPEAKER_03]: but I remember hearing that
[00:22:02.000] [SPEAKER_03]：但我记得听过这话
[00:22:03.600] [SPEAKER_03]: when Korean female actresses
[00:22:03.600] [SPEAKER_03]：当韩国女演员
[00:22:05.880] [SPEAKER_03]: would go on like
[00:22:05.880] [SPEAKER_03]：会继续这样
[00:22:07.540] [SPEAKER_03]: erotic movies or like
[00:22:07.540] [SPEAKER_03]：色情电影或类似的东西
[00:22:08.600] [SPEAKER_03]: just things with the sex scene.
[00:22:08.600] [SPEAKER_03]：只是和性爱场景有关的事情。
[00:22:09.920] [SPEAKER_03]: If they did too many of them,
[00:22:09.920] [SPEAKER_03]：如果他们做得太多了，
[00:22:12.860] [SPEAKER_03]: then somehow their reputation
[00:22:12.860] [SPEAKER_03]：然后不知何故，他们的声誉
[00:22:14.340] [SPEAKER_03]: was like damaged.
[00:22:14.340] [SPEAKER_03]：像是损坏了。
[00:22:15.680] [SPEAKER_03]: So you had to be very
[00:22:15.680] [SPEAKER_03]：所以你必须非常
[00:22:17.020] [SPEAKER_03]: like tasteful about which movie
[00:22:17.020] [SPEAKER_03]：就像对哪部电影有品味一样
[00:22:18.520] [SPEAKER_03]: you decided to like
[00:22:18.520] [SPEAKER_03]：你决定喜欢
[00:22:19.740] [SPEAKER_03]: use your sex scene
[00:22:19.740] [SPEAKER_03]：用你的性爱场景
[00:22:20.920] [SPEAKER_02]: and you're like,
[00:22:20.920] [SPEAKER_02]：然后你就想，
[00:22:24.020] [SPEAKER_02]: I think this movie will be a banger.
[00:22:24.020] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得这部电影会大卖。
[00:22:25.940] [SPEAKER_02]: So it's OK.
[00:22:25.940] [SPEAKER_02]：所以没关系。
[00:22:26.680] [SPEAKER_02]: It has a sex scene.
[00:22:26.680] [SPEAKER_02]：里面有性爱场景。
[00:22:28.740] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:28.740] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，是啊。
[00:22:29.740] [SPEAKER_02]: It's an artistic one.
[00:22:29.740] [SPEAKER_02]：这是一个艺术作品。
[00:22:31.500] [SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember
[00:22:31.500] [SPEAKER_02]：我的意思是，我记得
[00:22:32.540] [SPEAKER_02]: watching K dramas.
[00:22:32.540] [SPEAKER_02]：在看韩剧。
[00:22:34.160] [SPEAKER_02]: If people kissed horizontally,
[00:22:34.160] [SPEAKER_02]：如果人们横着接吻，
[00:22:36.460] [SPEAKER_02]: it was like crazy.
[00:22:36.460] [SPEAKER_02]：简直太疯狂了。
[00:22:38.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, horizontally?
[00:22:38.580] [SPEAKER_02]：等等，是水平方向吗？
[00:22:39.640] [SPEAKER_02]: Like on a bed or a couch
[00:22:39.640] [SPEAKER_02]：比如在床上或沙发上
[00:22:41.040] [SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[00:22:41.040] [SPEAKER_02]：或者别的什么。
[00:22:43.520] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, yes.
[00:22:43.520] [SPEAKER_01]：哦，等等，是的。
[00:22:46.340] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like, holy fuck.
[00:22:46.340] [SPEAKER_01]：我的天哪。
[00:22:48.360] [SPEAKER_01]: They're implying
[00:22:48.360] [SPEAKER_01]：他们的意思是
[00:22:49.540] [SPEAKER_01]: not just making out.
[00:22:49.540] [SPEAKER_01]：不仅仅是亲热。
[00:22:52.220] [SPEAKER_04]: Well, I feel like the implication
[00:22:52.220] [SPEAKER_04]：嗯，我觉得这暗示着……
[00:22:53.800] [SPEAKER_04]: or what alludes to them having sex
[00:22:53.800] [SPEAKER_04]：或者暗示他们发生性关系
[00:22:55.760] [SPEAKER_04]: is when they pull the covers
[00:22:55.760] [SPEAKER_04]：就是他们掀开被子的时候
[00:22:57.140] [SPEAKER_04]: up over their heads.
[00:22:57.140] [SPEAKER_04]：远远超过他们的头顶。
[00:22:58.560] [SPEAKER_02]: Do I feel like that
[00:22:58.560] [SPEAKER_02]：我感觉是这样吗？
[00:22:59.320] [SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really happen in K dramas?
[00:22:59.320] [SPEAKER_02]：韩剧里真的不会发生这种事吗？
[00:23:01.100] [SPEAKER_02]: At least the ones that I've seen.
[00:23:01.100] [SPEAKER_02]：至少我看到的那些是这样的。
[00:23:02.420] [SPEAKER_04]: Wait, really?
[00:23:02.420] [SPEAKER_04]：等等，真的吗？
[00:23:02.980] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it used
[00:23:02.980] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得它用过
[00:23:03.620] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it was like the old way
[00:23:03.620] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得这就像以前的老方法一样。
[00:23:05.140] [SPEAKER_04]: of being like, oh, they're having sex
[00:23:05.140] [SPEAKER_04]：就像，哦，他们在做爱
[00:23:06.500] [SPEAKER_04]: and they would just pull the covers up.
[00:23:06.500] [SPEAKER_04]：然后他们就会把被子掀开。
[00:23:08.080] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, or a baby pops out
[00:23:08.080] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，或者一个婴儿突然冒了出来。
[00:23:10.040] [SPEAKER_03]: in the next episode.
[00:23:10.040] [SPEAKER_03]：下一集见。
[00:23:12.320] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like most of the ones
[00:23:12.320] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得大多数人
[00:23:14.380] [SPEAKER_02]: that I've seen,
[00:23:14.380] [SPEAKER_02]：就我所见，
[00:23:15.780] [SPEAKER_02]: they just like kiss
[00:23:15.780] [SPEAKER_02]：他们就像亲吻一样
[00:23:17.420] [SPEAKER_02]: and then it's like, OK.
[00:23:17.420] [SPEAKER_02]：然后就好像，好吧。
[00:23:18.720] [SPEAKER_02]: And then if they kiss on a bed,
[00:23:18.720] [SPEAKER_02]：然后如果他们在床上接吻，
[00:23:21.200] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, whoa, that's crazy.
[00:23:21.200] [SPEAKER_02]：我当时就想，哇，这太疯狂了。
[00:23:24.660] [SPEAKER_03]: There's like those Muckdang dramas
[00:23:24.660] [SPEAKER_03]：就像那些《Muckdang》电视剧一样
[00:23:26.380] [SPEAKER_03]: that like have some really saucy scenes.
[00:23:26.380] [SPEAKER_03]：里面有一些非常露骨的场景。
[00:23:29.360] [SPEAKER_03]: Muckdang is like so
[00:23:29.360] [SPEAKER_03]: Muckdang 就是这样
[00:23:30.640] [SPEAKER_03]: in that Pada 1997 kissing scene,
[00:23:30.640] [SPEAKER_03]：在1997年电影《帕达》的吻戏中，
[00:23:34.760] [SPEAKER_03]: like Liz Renfrew in my head.
[00:23:34.760] [SPEAKER_03]：就像我脑海中的 Liz Renfrew 一样。
[00:23:36.440] [SPEAKER_03]: It was just like such a good kiss.
[00:23:36.440] [SPEAKER_03]：那感觉就像一个美好的吻。
[00:23:38.640] [SPEAKER_03]: Was it like spicy?
[00:23:38.640] [SPEAKER_03]：是辣的吗？
[00:23:40.220] [SPEAKER_03]: And there were multiple.
[00:23:40.220] [SPEAKER_03]：而且不止一个。
[00:23:45.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like
[00:23:45.230] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我觉得
[00:23:46.230] [SPEAKER_02]: well, actually, to be fair,
[00:23:46.230] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，实际上，公平地说，
[00:23:47.870] [SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like at least
[00:23:47.870] [SPEAKER_02]：我感觉至少
[00:23:49.990] [SPEAKER_02]: the dramas on Netflix,
[00:23:49.990] [SPEAKER_02]：Netflix上的剧集，
[00:23:52.130] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of the kisses are a little
[00:23:52.130] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，有些吻有点
[00:23:53.850] [SPEAKER_02]: they feel a little more real,
[00:23:53.850] [SPEAKER_02]：它们感觉更真实一些，
[00:23:55.870] [SPEAKER_02]: almost like a little more American
[00:23:55.870] [SPEAKER_02]：几乎更像美国人了。
[00:23:58.170] [SPEAKER_02]: or Hollywood style kisses.
[00:23:58.170] [SPEAKER_02]：或者好莱坞式的吻。
[00:24:00.310] [SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[00:24:00.310] [SPEAKER_02]：好的。
[00:24:00.670] [SPEAKER_02]: But before it was always the like
[00:24:00.670] [SPEAKER_02]：但以前总是这样
[00:24:03.470] [SPEAKER_02]: peck and someone looks like so surprised
[00:24:03.470] [SPEAKER_02]：啄了一下，有人看起来很惊讶
[00:24:05.790] [SPEAKER_02]: eyes wide like, holy fuck.
[00:24:05.790] [SPEAKER_02]：眼睛瞪得老大，就像，我的天哪。
[00:24:07.930] [SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[00:24:07.930] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道吗？
[00:24:09.110] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's definitely been an evolution.
[00:24:09.110] [SPEAKER_02]：是的，确实发生了演变。
[00:24:12.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's an influence
[00:24:12.090] [SPEAKER_03]：你认为这是一种影响吗？
[00:24:13.590] [SPEAKER_03]: of like Netflix or
[00:24:13.590] [SPEAKER_03]：就像 Netflix 或
[00:24:16.010] [SPEAKER_03]: as if the times are kind of changing?
[00:24:16.010] [SPEAKER_03]：好像时代正在发生变化？
[00:24:17.990] [SPEAKER_02]: My personal theory is that it's
[00:24:17.990] [SPEAKER_02]：我个人的看法是……
[00:24:21.870] [SPEAKER_02]: maybe some influence from international audiences
[00:24:21.870] [SPEAKER_02]：或许会受到国际观众的一些影响
[00:24:24.690] [SPEAKER_02]: because I think maybe like
[00:24:24.690] [SPEAKER_02]：因为我觉得也许像
[00:24:27.890] [SPEAKER_02]: from what I've seen,
[00:24:27.890] [SPEAKER_02]：就我所见，
[00:24:29.430] [SPEAKER_02]: I only really read like American,
[00:24:29.430] [SPEAKER_02]：我的阅读风格其实只有美国式的。
[00:24:31.870] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, English, Reddit or whatever.
[00:24:31.870] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，英语、Reddit 或其他什么。
[00:24:34.010] [SPEAKER_02]: People are they would like kind of
[00:24:34.010] [SPEAKER_02]：人们会喜欢这种
[00:24:35.930] [SPEAKER_02]: clown K-drama sometimes being like,
[00:24:35.930] [SPEAKER_02]：小丑韩剧有时候就像这样，
[00:24:38.070] [SPEAKER_02]: dude, this kiss is like so,
[00:24:38.070] [SPEAKER_02]：老兄，这个吻简直太棒了，
[00:24:40.370] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like that's not a kiss
[00:24:40.370] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，那根本不算吻。
[00:24:41.990] [SPEAKER_02]: or like K-drama has the classic
[00:24:41.990] [SPEAKER_02]：或者像韩剧那样，经典
[00:24:44.790] [SPEAKER_02]: someone is just like frozen
[00:24:44.790] [SPEAKER_02]：有人就像冻住了一样
[00:24:46.810] [SPEAKER_02]: and like getting a peck on their cheek
[00:24:46.810] [SPEAKER_02]：就像脸颊上被轻轻一吻一样
[00:24:49.190] [SPEAKER_02]: or like the guy is like making out
[00:24:49.190] [SPEAKER_02]：或者就像那家伙在亲热一样
[00:24:51.010] [SPEAKER_02]: with the girl, but she's like not
[00:24:51.010] [SPEAKER_02]：和那个女孩在一起，但她好像不是
[00:24:52.570] [SPEAKER_02]: making out back or whatever.
[00:24:52.570] [SPEAKER_02]：在后面亲热什么的。
[00:24:54.850] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[00:24:54.850] [SPEAKER_02]：是的。
[00:24:55.110] [SPEAKER_02]: And I think after seeing all of that,
[00:24:55.110] [SPEAKER_02]：我想在看到这一切之后，
[00:24:57.210] [SPEAKER_02]: it's been like more gradual
[00:24:57.210] [SPEAKER_02]：这更像是一个渐进的过程
[00:24:58.870] [SPEAKER_02]: that it's like changed a bit.
[00:24:58.870] [SPEAKER_02]：好像有点变化了。
[00:25:00.970] [SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it's also like
[00:25:00.970] [SPEAKER_04]：我想知道它是否也像
[00:25:02.790] [SPEAKER_04]: the power of YouTube
[00:25:02.790] [SPEAKER_04]：YouTube 的力量
[00:25:04.850] [SPEAKER_04]: or something or like reels and whatnot,
[00:25:04.850] [SPEAKER_04]：或者像卷轴之类的东西，
[00:25:06.970] [SPEAKER_04]: because I know certain kiss scenes
[00:25:06.970] [SPEAKER_04]：因为我知道某些吻戏
[00:25:10.350] [SPEAKER_04]: have gone viral over the years
[00:25:10.350] [SPEAKER_04]：多年来一直在网络上疯传
[00:25:12.130] [SPEAKER_04]: of like, oh my God, they're like
[00:25:12.130] [SPEAKER_04]：就像，我的天哪，他们就像
[00:25:13.670] [SPEAKER_04]: actually having like a full fledged kiss scene.
[00:25:13.670] [SPEAKER_04]：实际上有一场完整的吻戏。
[00:25:16.130] [SPEAKER_04]: And then that video will do numbers
[00:25:16.130] [SPEAKER_04]：然后那段视频就会火爆起来。
[00:25:18.350] [SPEAKER_04]: on like YouTube or something.
[00:25:18.350] [SPEAKER_04]：比如在 YouTube 之类的网站上。
[00:25:19.810] [SPEAKER_04]: So maybe producers see that
[00:25:19.810] [SPEAKER_04]：所以也许制片人看到了这一点
[00:25:21.910] [SPEAKER_04]: and they're like, oh, like this seems
[00:25:21.910] [SPEAKER_04]：然后他们会说，哦，这看起来好像
[00:25:23.530] [SPEAKER_04]: to stir up some sort of like
[00:25:23.530] [SPEAKER_04]：激起某种类似
[00:25:24.910] [SPEAKER_04]: social media thing.
[00:25:24.910] [SPEAKER_04]：社交媒体之类的东西。
[00:25:25.870] [SPEAKER_04]: Like we should also do an intense kiss scene.
[00:25:25.870] [SPEAKER_04]：比如我们也应该拍一场激烈的吻戏。
[00:25:28.230] [SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately it's like
[00:25:28.230] [SPEAKER_03]：但最终就像
[00:25:29.470] [SPEAKER_03]: to get more viewers somehow.
[00:25:29.470] [SPEAKER_03]：想办法吸引更多观众。
[00:25:31.770] [SPEAKER_02]: Probably I would guess so.
[00:25:31.770] [SPEAKER_02]：我猜大概是这样。
[00:25:34.450] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but question.
[00:25:34.450] [SPEAKER_02]：等等，但有个问题。
[00:25:36.250] [SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen a K-reality
[00:25:36.250] [SPEAKER_02]：你有没有看过韩流真人秀？
[00:25:38.990] [SPEAKER_02]: show where people have kissed?
[00:25:38.990] [SPEAKER_02]：显示人们接吻过的地方？
[00:25:42.290] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I have.
[00:25:42.290] [SPEAKER_02]：等等，我有。
[00:25:44.050] [SPEAKER_04]: It happened in a recent
[00:25:44.050] [SPEAKER_04]：这发生在最近
[00:25:46.150] [SPEAKER_04]: I Am Solo season.
[00:25:46.150] [SPEAKER_04]：我是独行侠季。
[00:25:48.050] [SPEAKER_04]: And it was like a huge thing
[00:25:48.050] [SPEAKER_04]：那就像一件大事。
[00:25:50.050] [SPEAKER_04]: because I Am Solo,
[00:25:50.050] [SPEAKER_04]：因为我是单身，
[00:25:52.030] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, like when you watch
[00:25:52.030] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，就像你看……
[00:25:52.910] [SPEAKER_04]: Heart Signal and like Exchange and stuff,
[00:25:52.910] [SPEAKER_04]：心跳信号和类似交流之类的，
[00:25:54.810] [SPEAKER_04]: there's like all these like romantic
[00:25:54.810] [SPEAKER_04]：这里有很多浪漫的东西
[00:25:56.690] [SPEAKER_04]: OST songs in the background
[00:25:56.690] [SPEAKER_04]：背景音乐是原声带歌曲
[00:25:58.650] [SPEAKER_04]: and there's like a narrative and whatnot.
[00:25:58.650] [SPEAKER_04]：然后还有个故事情节之类的。
[00:26:00.050] [SPEAKER_04]: I Am Solo is not like
[00:26:00.050] [SPEAKER_04]:《我是独行侠》不像
[00:26:01.130] [SPEAKER_04]: it's like on the fly.
[00:26:01.130] [SPEAKER_04]：就像即兴发挥一样。
[00:26:02.350] [SPEAKER_04]: Like it's very much like real
[00:26:02.350] [SPEAKER_04]：就像真的一样
[00:26:04.050] [SPEAKER_04]: and organic and just like
[00:26:04.050] [SPEAKER_04]：而且是有机的，就像
[00:26:05.830] [SPEAKER_04]: normal non influencer type people.
[00:26:05.830] [SPEAKER_04]：普通的非网红类型的人。
[00:26:08.650] [SPEAKER_04]: But two people kissed mid season
[00:26:08.650] [SPEAKER_04]：但是有两个人在赛季中期接吻了
[00:26:11.350] [SPEAKER_04]: and it was like a huge shock, I think.
[00:26:11.350] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得当时就像受到了巨大的冲击。
[00:26:14.810] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I saw a bunch of articles about it.
[00:26:14.810] [SPEAKER_04]：我看到过很多相关的文章。
[00:26:16.630] [SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[00:26:16.630] [SPEAKER_04]：哇。
[00:26:17.710] [SPEAKER_02]: I asked because like, well, one,
[00:26:17.710] [SPEAKER_02]：我问是因为，嗯，一个，
[00:26:19.350] [SPEAKER_02]: we've been talking about like
[00:26:19.350] [SPEAKER_02]：我们一直在谈论类似这样的事情
[00:26:20.850] [SPEAKER_02]: K-dramas are allowed to have
[00:26:20.850] [发言人_02]：韩剧是可以有的。
[00:26:22.050] [SPEAKER_02]: like kiss scenes and stuff.
[00:26:22.050] [SPEAKER_02]：比如吻戏之类的。
[00:26:23.570] [SPEAKER_02]: But also when I was watching Exchange,
[00:26:23.570] [SPEAKER_02]：但我在观看 Exchange 时，
[00:26:27.550] [SPEAKER_02]: these people are literally
[00:26:27.550] [SPEAKER_02]：这些人简直就是
[00:26:28.490] [SPEAKER_02]: like trying to date each other,
[00:26:28.490] [SPEAKER_02]：就像试图互相约会一样，
[00:26:29.930] [SPEAKER_02]: you know, like getting to know each other.
[00:26:29.930] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，就像互相了解一样。
[00:26:31.830] [SPEAKER_02]: And then at some point in the show,
[00:26:31.830] [SPEAKER_02]：然后在节目进行到某个阶段时，
[00:26:35.090] [SPEAKER_02]: this couple that I was rooting for,
[00:26:35.090] [SPEAKER_02]：我一直很支持的这对情侣，
[00:26:36.930] [SPEAKER_02]: they were like basically a couple.
[00:26:36.930] [SPEAKER_02]：他们基本上就像一对情侣。
[00:26:38.790] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, just fucking kiss her.
[00:26:38.790] [SPEAKER_02]：然后我就想，兄弟，直接吻她不就好了吗？
[00:26:40.810] [SPEAKER_02]: But then
[00:26:40.810] [SPEAKER_02]：但是后来
[00:26:43.390] [SPEAKER_02]: but then I looked up the rules
[00:26:43.390] [SPEAKER_02]：但我后来查阅了规则。
[00:26:45.670] [SPEAKER_02]: and the rules were like
[00:26:45.670] [SPEAKER_02]：规则是这样的
[00:26:47.490] [SPEAKER_02]: like the rules for the show.
[00:26:47.490] [SPEAKER_02]：就像节目的规则一样。
[00:26:48.790] [SPEAKER_02]: It was like you're not allowed to like
[00:26:48.790] [SPEAKER_02]：感觉就像你不被允许喜欢一样
[00:26:51.710] [SPEAKER_02]: actually define your relationship.
[00:26:51.710] [SPEAKER_02]：请明确你们之间的关系。
[00:26:54.010] [SPEAKER_02]: You can't hold hands.
[00:26:54.010] [SPEAKER_02]：你们不能牵手。
[00:26:55.990] [SPEAKER_02]: You can't kiss each other.
[00:26:55.990] [SPEAKER_02]：你们不能互相亲吻。
[00:26:58.010] [SPEAKER_02]: You can't like do any of that.
[00:26:58.010] [SPEAKER_02]：你不能做任何这些事。
[00:26:59.950] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[00:26:59.950] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，对。
[00:27:00.330] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was another thing.
[00:27:00.330] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，还有另一件事。
[00:27:01.370] [SPEAKER_02]: They were like walking down the road
[00:27:01.370] [SPEAKER_02]：他们就像在路上散步一样。
[00:27:02.710] [SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, oh, this is so cute.
[00:27:02.710] [SPEAKER_02]：然后我就想，哦，这太可爱了。
[00:27:04.310] [SPEAKER_02]: Like why don't you just fucking hold her hand?
[00:27:04.310] [SPEAKER_02]：你为什么不直接牵着她的手呢？
[00:27:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]: But then I found out
[00:27:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]：但后来我发现
[00:27:08.430] [SPEAKER_02]: it was like against the rules
[00:27:08.430] [SPEAKER_02]：这就像违反规则一样
[00:27:09.570] [SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, I was like, come on, guys,
[00:27:09.570] [SPEAKER_02]：然后我就说，我说，拜托，伙计们，
[00:27:11.950] [SPEAKER_02]: it's just hand holding.
[00:27:11.950] [SPEAKER_02]：只是牵手而已。
[00:27:14.110] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's so interesting.
[00:27:14.110] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，这太有趣了。
[00:27:17.330] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like love after divorce,
[00:27:17.330] [SPEAKER_03]：离婚后我感觉自己又爱上了别人，
[00:27:19.330] [SPEAKER_03]: the season with Kyo Puls
[00:27:19.330] [SPEAKER_03]：与 Kyo Puls 的赛季
[00:27:20.710] [SPEAKER_03]: or like international grins.
[00:27:20.710] [SPEAKER_03]：或者像国际式的微笑。
[00:27:23.430] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they did kiss, but I don't remember.
[00:27:23.430] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得他们接吻了，但我记不清了。
[00:27:27.170] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just assumed they did
[00:27:27.170] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我只是想当然地认为他们会这么做。
[00:27:28.890] [SPEAKER_04]: because there wasn't
[00:27:28.890] [SPEAKER_04]：因为没有
[00:27:29.970] [SPEAKER_04]: like an explicit kissing scene, I think.
[00:27:29.970] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得就像一段露骨的接吻戏。
[00:27:32.150] [SPEAKER_04]: But it was like implied
[00:27:32.150] [SPEAKER_04]：但这就像暗示的那样
[00:27:34.190] [SPEAKER_04]: slash slightly shown
[00:27:34.190] [SPEAKER_04]：斜杠略微显露
[00:27:35.490] [SPEAKER_04]: that there was like a couple
[00:27:35.490] [SPEAKER_04]：好像有那么几个
[00:27:36.690] [SPEAKER_04]: that was laying in bed together
[00:27:36.690] [SPEAKER_04]：他们当时一起躺在床上。
[00:27:38.870] [SPEAKER_04]: for like multiple hours a day.
[00:27:38.870] [SPEAKER_04]：每天好几个小时。
[00:27:40.370] [SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[00:27:40.370] [SPEAKER_04]：哇。
[00:27:40.990] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, OK, well,
[00:27:40.990] [SPEAKER_04]：然后我就想，好吧，
[00:27:42.470] [SPEAKER_04]: they're probably just like not showing us.
[00:27:42.470] [SPEAKER_04]：他们可能只是不想给我们看。
[00:27:44.710] [SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yeah, I didn't love that couple.
[00:27:44.710] [SPEAKER_02]：啊，是的，我不喜欢那对夫妇。
[00:27:50.010] [SPEAKER_02]: OK, I guess to be fair,
[00:27:50.010] [SPEAKER_02]：好吧，公平地说，
[00:27:51.770] [SPEAKER_02]: now that I'm thinking about it,
[00:27:51.770] [SPEAKER_02]：现在想想，
[00:27:53.650] [SPEAKER_02]: it would be a little weird
[00:27:53.650] [SPEAKER_02]：这会有点奇怪
[00:27:55.150] [SPEAKER_02]: to be filmed like kissing someone, huh?
[00:27:55.150] [SPEAKER_02]：被拍下来就像亲吻某人一样，是吗？
[00:27:59.470] [SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[00:27:59.470] [SPEAKER_04]：没错。
[00:28:00.530] [SPEAKER_04]: Although allegedly,
[00:28:00.530] [SPEAKER_04]：虽然据称，
[00:28:01.710] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, after like a couple days,
[00:28:01.710] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，大概过了几天之后，
[00:28:04.110] [SPEAKER_04]: you forget the cameras are there.
[00:28:04.110] [SPEAKER_04]：你忘了那里有摄像头。
[00:28:05.690] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how real that is,
[00:28:05.690] [SPEAKER_04]：我不知道那有多真实，
[00:28:06.990] [SPEAKER_04]: but I think for some people
[00:28:06.990] [SPEAKER_04]：但我认为对某些人来说
[00:28:08.030] [SPEAKER_04]: they're like able to kind of start blocking it out.
[00:28:08.030] [SPEAKER_04]：他们好像能够开始屏蔽掉它。
[00:28:10.430] [SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[00:28:10.430] [SPEAKER_03]：我明白了。
[00:28:11.410] [SPEAKER_03]: I could see that being real, because like,
[00:28:11.410] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这很有可能，因为，
[00:28:14.170] [SPEAKER_03]: would they really say that shit on camera?
[00:28:14.170] [SPEAKER_03]：他们真的会在镜头前说这种话吗？
[00:28:16.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?
[00:28:16.610] [SPEAKER_03]：你知道我的意思吗？
[00:28:18.070] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like down like.
[00:28:18.070] [SPEAKER_03]：就像往下掉一样。
[00:28:20.870] [SPEAKER_03]: I always thought
[00:28:20.870] [SPEAKER_03]：我一直觉得
[00:28:21.750] [SPEAKER_03]: like people go on reality TV shows
[00:28:21.750] [SPEAKER_03]：就像人们参加真人秀节目一样
[00:28:23.130] [SPEAKER_03]: are trying to be famous.
[00:28:23.130] [SPEAKER_03]：他们都想出名。
[00:28:24.850] [SPEAKER_03]: But after watching some like,
[00:28:24.850] [SPEAKER_03]：但是看了一些东西之后，
[00:28:26.690] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, like they're really behaving like this.
[00:28:26.690] [SPEAKER_03]: 哦，他们真的会这样吗？
[00:28:28.770] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they're actually kind of immersed
[00:28:28.770] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得他们其实挺沉浸其中的。
[00:28:31.690] [SPEAKER_03]: and sort of like bought into the idea of the show
[00:28:31.690] [SPEAKER_03]：而且有点接受了这个节目的理念。
[00:28:35.670] [SPEAKER_03]: because they've been doing it for a while.
[00:28:35.670] [SPEAKER_03]：因为他们已经这样做了很久了。
[00:28:38.830] [SPEAKER_04]: I think you bring up a good point, though.
[00:28:38.830] [SPEAKER_04]：不过，我认为你提出的观点很好。
[00:28:40.830] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like I find the best seasons of Korean reality TV
[00:28:40.830] [SPEAKER_04]：感觉就像我找到了韩国真人秀节目的最佳季。
[00:28:45.110] [SPEAKER_04]: are that good because I don't feel like any of the cast
[00:28:45.110] [SPEAKER_04]：这样好是因为我觉得自己不像任何一个演员。
[00:28:49.250] [SPEAKER_04]: is only on there to become like an influencer.
[00:28:49.250] [SPEAKER_04]：只是为了成为网红才去那里的。
[00:28:51.630] [SPEAKER_04]: Like as soon as I can clock that, I'm like, OK,
[00:28:51.630] [SPEAKER_04]：就像我一旦意识到这一点，我就会想，好吧，
[00:28:54.970] [SPEAKER_04]: this season is like fake
[00:28:54.970] [SPEAKER_04]：这一季就像是假的
[00:28:56.030] [SPEAKER_04]: because then I just start to question everything they're doing.
[00:28:56.030] [SPEAKER_04]：因为那样我就会开始质疑他们所做的一切。
[00:28:58.670] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, you want to be portrayed as like the good guy
[00:28:58.670] [SPEAKER_04]：我就想，哦，你想被塑造成好人形象啊
[00:29:01.250] [SPEAKER_04]: or like you're like pushing this image of scorned women
[00:29:01.250] [SPEAKER_04]：或者你好像在刻意塑造这种被抛弃的女性形象。
[00:29:04.730] [SPEAKER_04]: or like whatever.
[00:29:04.730] [SPEAKER_04]：或者随便什么都行。
[00:29:06.130] [SPEAKER_04]: And it just like really puts me off.
[00:29:06.130] [SPEAKER_04]：这真的让我很反感。
[00:29:08.010] [SPEAKER_04]: So then I feel like the seasons that do really well
[00:29:08.010] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我觉得那些表现非常出色的剧集……
[00:29:10.450] [SPEAKER_04]: are because no one is like out there clearly trying to chase fame.
[00:29:10.450] [SPEAKER_04]：是因为没有人像他那样明显地想要追逐名利。
[00:29:14.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[00:29:14.610] [SPEAKER_04]：我同意。
[00:29:15.550] [SPEAKER_03]: Did you watch Singles Inferno season three?
[00:29:15.550] [SPEAKER_03]：你看过《单身地狱》第三季吗？
[00:29:18.530] [SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what happened.
[00:29:18.530] [SPEAKER_03]：我不知道发生了什么事。
[00:29:21.230] [SPEAKER_03]: My favorite character there, she was just so real.
[00:29:21.230] [SPEAKER_03]：我最喜欢的角色，她太真实了。
[00:29:24.170] [SPEAKER_03]: Ha Jung.
[00:29:24.170] [SPEAKER_03]: 河正。
[00:29:25.190] [SPEAKER_03]: But what I liked about her was that she was kind of like,
[00:29:25.190] [SPEAKER_03]：但我喜欢她的一点是，她有点像，
[00:29:28.490] [SPEAKER_03]: you know what, I'm going to do me.
[00:29:28.490] [SPEAKER_03]：你知道吗，我要做我自己。
[00:29:29.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, I like this person.
[00:29:29.670] [SPEAKER_03]：嗯，我喜欢这个人。
[00:29:30.610] [SPEAKER_03]: They don't like me back with OK.
[00:29:30.610] [SPEAKER_03]：他们不喜欢我回复“OK”。
[00:29:31.870] [SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we got to see some like character growth
[00:29:31.870] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得我们看到了一些角色成长。
[00:29:34.890] [SPEAKER_03]: because she like cried and like, she's like, oh, it's just like,
[00:29:34.890] [SPEAKER_03]：因为她哭了，然后，她说，哦，就是这样，
[00:29:37.650] [SPEAKER_03]: you know, following my heart.
[00:29:37.650] [SPEAKER_03]：你知道，听从我的内心。
[00:29:38.690] [SPEAKER_03]: But she wasn't like annoying about it or like doing it for clout.
[00:29:38.690] [SPEAKER_03]：但她并没有因此而惹人厌烦，也没有为了博取关注而这样做。
[00:29:41.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it was very clearly like not the best reality TV show
[00:29:41.670] [SPEAKER_03]：很明显，这并不是一档最好的真人秀节目。
[00:29:45.310] [SPEAKER_03]: like outcome for her technically. Right.
[00:29:45.310] [SPEAKER_03]：从技术上讲，这对她来说是结果。没错。
[00:29:47.310] [SPEAKER_03]: Like she could have left with someone.
[00:29:47.310] [SPEAKER_03]：好像她可以跟别人一起离开似的。
[00:29:49.170] [SPEAKER_03]: But she was like, no, I'm going to be true to myself,
[00:29:49.170] [SPEAKER_03]：但她却说，不，我要忠于自己，
[00:29:51.190] [SPEAKER_03]: even though I get rejected on camera.
[00:29:51.190] [SPEAKER_03]：即使我在镜头前被拒绝。
[00:29:53.290] [SPEAKER_03]: That was very admirable to me. Yeah.
[00:29:53.290] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得这非常令人钦佩。是的。
[00:29:58.930] [SPEAKER_03]: Also, going back to the Terrace House had a lot of implied sex.
[00:29:58.930] [SPEAKER_03]：另外，回到露台公寓有很多性暗示。
[00:30:03.530] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really? Oh, yeah.
[00:30:03.530] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，真的吗？哦，是的。
[00:30:05.510] [SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't know this because I never watched Terrace House.
[00:30:05.510] [SPEAKER_02]：我其实不知道这件事，因为我从来没看过《双层公寓》。
[00:30:08.150] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys never?
[00:30:08.150] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，你们从来没有过这种经历吗？
[00:30:09.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I only watched like one or two shows.
[00:30:09.610] [SPEAKER_04]：我只看过一两集。
[00:30:11.630] [SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I saw in Terrace House was like,
[00:30:11.630] [SPEAKER_02]：我在《双层公寓》里唯一看到的就是，
[00:30:14.250] [SPEAKER_02]: I know, like some people got really mad over like
[00:30:14.250] [SPEAKER_02]：我知道，就像有些人真的为此生气了一样，
[00:30:17.930] [SPEAKER_02]: some beef in the fridge or something.
[00:30:17.930] [SPEAKER_02]：冰箱里应该还有一些牛肉之类的东西。
[00:30:20.650] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. The meat drama.
[00:30:20.650] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，肉类风波。
[00:30:23.550] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's like the only thing.
[00:30:23.550] [SPEAKER_01]：是啊，好像只有这一件事。
[00:30:24.690] [SPEAKER_01]: They ate her.
[00:30:24.690] [SPEAKER_01]：他们吃了她。
[00:30:26.970] [SPEAKER_03]: It was his.
[00:30:26.970] [SPEAKER_03]：那是他的。
[00:30:29.270] [SPEAKER_03]: It was high quality.
[00:30:29.270] [SPEAKER_03]：质量很好。
[00:30:32.450] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so how is the implied sex implied?
[00:30:32.450] [SPEAKER_03]：等等，那么，这种暗示性的性行为是如何暗示的呢？
[00:30:36.270] [SPEAKER_03]: When people would couple up in the show,
[00:30:36.270] [SPEAKER_03]：当人们在节目中配对时，
[00:30:38.810] [SPEAKER_03]: sometimes the other contestants would like give them space
[00:30:38.810] [SPEAKER_03]：有时候其他参赛者会想给他们留出空间。
[00:30:42.090] [SPEAKER_04]: or like give them their own room.
[00:30:42.090] [SPEAKER_04]：或者给他们自己的房间。
[00:30:44.490] [SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a crazy contrast.
[00:30:44.490] [SPEAKER_04]：这对比太强烈了。
[00:30:47.290] [SPEAKER_04]: So I watched the recent Love Island season.
[00:30:47.290] [SPEAKER_04]：我看了最近一季的《爱情岛》。
[00:30:50.690] [SPEAKER_04]: If you've never watched Love Island,
[00:30:50.690] [SPEAKER_04]：如果你从未看过《爱情岛》，
[00:30:52.010] [SPEAKER_04]: they have this thing called like the Hideaway,
[00:30:52.010] [SPEAKER_04]：他们有个地方叫“隐蔽处”，
[00:30:54.150] [SPEAKER_04]: which I think is like a separate room or something.
[00:30:54.150] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得那就像一个单独的房间之类的。
[00:30:57.210] [SPEAKER_04]: So once you're like an official couple on the show,
[00:30:57.210] [SPEAKER_04]：所以一旦你在节目中正式成为情侣，
[00:30:59.510] [SPEAKER_04]: you can go and have implied sex.
[00:30:59.510] [SPEAKER_04]：你可以去进行暗示性的性行为。
[00:31:02.130] [SPEAKER_04]: But not only is it implied that you're having sex there,
[00:31:02.130] [SPEAKER_04]：但这不仅暗示你们在那里发生性行为，
[00:31:05.010] [SPEAKER_04]: they actively talk about it.
[00:31:05.010] [SPEAKER_04]：他们会积极地谈论这件事。
[00:31:06.410] [SPEAKER_04]: So on the recent season,
[00:31:06.410] [SPEAKER_04]：那么在最近的赛季中，
[00:31:07.550] [SPEAKER_04]: like a couple went to the Hideaway and they like
[00:31:07.550] [SPEAKER_04]：就像一对情侣去了隐蔽处，他们喜欢
[00:31:09.850] [SPEAKER_04]: spent a night together.
[00:31:09.850] [SPEAKER_04]：一起度过了一夜。
[00:31:11.010] [SPEAKER_04]: And then the next day, they were like, oh, my God,
[00:31:11.010] [SPEAKER_04]：然后第二天，他们就说，哦，我的天哪，
[00:31:12.930] [SPEAKER_04]: like last night was so amazing.
[00:31:12.930] [SPEAKER_04]：昨晚真是太棒了。
[00:31:15.010] [SPEAKER_04]: I loved when we did this or whatever.
[00:31:15.010] [SPEAKER_04]：我喜欢我们做这件事或者其他什么事的时候。
[00:31:16.950] [SPEAKER_04]: And they were kind of like alluding to what happened.
[00:31:16.950] [SPEAKER_04]：他们好像是在暗示发生了什么事。
[00:31:19.110] [SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, what the fuck?
[00:31:19.110] [SPEAKER_04]：我当时就想，这他妈什么鬼？
[00:31:20.550] [SPEAKER_04]: Like, this is TMI.
[00:31:20.550] [SPEAKER_04]：这信息量太大了。
[00:31:22.270] [SPEAKER_02]: So wild.
[00:31:22.270] [SPEAKER_02]：太疯狂了。
[00:31:24.110] [SPEAKER_02]: OK, I will I will say like there's probably no way
[00:31:24.110] [SPEAKER_02]：好吧，我会说，可能没办法
[00:31:27.470] [SPEAKER_02]: anyone is going to film reality TV people having sex.
[00:31:27.470] [SPEAKER_02]：任何人都会拍摄真人秀节目中人们的性爱过程。
[00:31:32.750] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's like a little invasive.
[00:31:32.750] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我觉得这有点侵犯隐私。
[00:31:35.370] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:35.370] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，是啊。
[00:31:36.330] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's so funny, the difference between like Love Island,
[00:31:36.330] [SPEAKER_02]：但我认为这很有趣，比如《爱情岛》和……之间的区别，
[00:31:41.050] [SPEAKER_02]: they're actively talking about it after versus Terrace House
[00:31:41.050] [SPEAKER_02]：他们在《双层公寓》之后一直在积极讨论这件事。
[00:31:44.870] [SPEAKER_02]: is just like, oh, we'll give you some space.
[00:31:44.870] [SPEAKER_02]：就好像，哦，我们会给你一些空间。
[00:31:47.390] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't ask, don't tell.
[00:31:47.390] [SPEAKER_02]：别问，别说。
[00:31:49.910] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah. But like kind of like other contestants
[00:31:49.910] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊。但有点像其他参赛者一样。
[00:31:52.730] [SPEAKER_03]: will kind of like make eyes at each other, like, you know, it is
[00:31:52.730] [SPEAKER_03]：会有点像互相抛媚眼，你知道，就是这样。
[00:31:57.290] [SPEAKER_03]: Korean shows. You wouldn't see that.
[00:31:57.290] [SPEAKER_03]：韩国的节目。你不会看到那种场面。
[00:31:59.730] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like it's usually against the rules.
[00:31:59.730] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我觉得这通常是违反规则的。
[00:32:03.330] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like too scandalous.
[00:32:03.330] [SPEAKER_04]：这太伤风败俗了。
[00:32:05.710] [SPEAKER_04]: So I have like a random question for you guys.
[00:32:05.710] [SPEAKER_04]：我有个问题想问问大家。
[00:32:08.910] [SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that you guys do
[00:32:08.910] [SPEAKER_04]：你们有什么活动吗？
[00:32:10.510] [SPEAKER_04]: while you're watching a season of reality TV that you think
[00:32:10.510] [SPEAKER_04]：当你观看一季真人秀节目时，你觉得
[00:32:14.130] [SPEAKER_04]: enhances the experience at all, whether that's like watching
[00:32:14.130] [SPEAKER_04]：提升整体体验，无论是观看
[00:32:17.230] [SPEAKER_04]: clips on TikTok and reading comments or like, how engaged are you with the community?
[00:32:17.230] [SPEAKER_04]：在TikTok上观看视频片段，阅读评论或点赞，你与社区的互动程度如何？
[00:32:23.630] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I definitely look up Reddit threads after.
[00:32:23.630] [SPEAKER_02]：兄弟，我之后肯定会去Reddit上看帖子。
[00:32:27.810] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. And I'm like so deep into like what other people are theorizing.
[00:32:27.810] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊。我完全沉浸在其他人提出的理论中。
[00:32:32.350] [SPEAKER_02]: I think it's helpful to because sometimes it's like
[00:32:32.350] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得这样做很有帮助，因为有时候就像……
[00:32:34.870] [SPEAKER_02]: Korean Americans who are watching.
[00:32:34.870] [SPEAKER_02]：正在观看的韩裔美国人。
[00:32:36.410] [SPEAKER_02]: So they'll be like, oh, yeah, I read this on like the Korean forums
[00:32:36.410] [SPEAKER_02]：所以他们会说，哦，是的，我是在韩国论坛上看到的。
[00:32:39.450] [SPEAKER_02]: and they're sharing it with like, you know, us, us non-Koreans.
[00:32:39.450] [SPEAKER_02]：他们也和我们这些非韩国人分享。
[00:32:43.550] [SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is valuable information.
[00:32:43.550] [SPEAKER_02]：我就想，这是很有价值的信息。
[00:32:46.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, that's so true.
[00:32:46.510] [SPEAKER_03]：等等，这说得太对了。
[00:32:48.030] [SPEAKER_03]: I get like I get deep in there, especially if I'm really like invested
[00:32:48.030] [SPEAKER_03]：我很容易沉浸其中，尤其是我真的投入了很多精力的时候。
[00:32:52.110] [SPEAKER_03]: in some drama, the Hottie Man Ricky stuff.
[00:32:52.110] [SPEAKER_03]: 在某些戏剧中，帅哥瑞奇的那些事。
[00:32:55.870] [SPEAKER_03]: I was like in there, so like, dude, this girl's like anti-vaxxer.
[00:32:55.870] [SPEAKER_03]：我当时就在里面，所以，老兄，这个女孩是反疫苗者。
[00:33:02.570] [SPEAKER_03]: I found out so much information is so bad, but like
[00:33:02.570] [SPEAKER_03]：我发现很多信息都很糟糕，但是就像
[00:33:06.190] [SPEAKER_03]: it's both like Reddit threads stalking Instagrams.
[00:33:06.190] [SPEAKER_03]：这就像在Reddit上搜索Instagram帖子一样。
[00:33:09.810] [SPEAKER_03]: I so bad, but like they're just out there.
[00:33:09.810] [SPEAKER_03]：我太糟糕了，但他们就在那里。
[00:33:12.150] [SPEAKER_03]: So you find them.
[00:33:12.150] [SPEAKER_03]：所以你找到了它们。
[00:33:12.910] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, they have this picture at like the same location.
[00:33:12.910] [SPEAKER_03]：你会想，哦，他们在同一个地方拍了这张照片。
[00:33:16.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, are they together after the show?
[00:33:16.370] [SPEAKER_03]：比如，哦，他们演出结束后会在一起吗？
[00:33:20.090] [SPEAKER_02]: I yeah. Yeah.
[00:33:20.090] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，是啊。
[00:33:21.730] [SPEAKER_02]: I think there's definitely some interest of like,
[00:33:21.730] [SPEAKER_02]：我认为肯定有人对这方面感兴趣，
[00:33:24.450] [SPEAKER_02]: oh, are they together after the show?
[00:33:24.450] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，他们演出结束后在一起吗？
[00:33:26.210] [SPEAKER_02]: I remember after season one of Singles Inferno,
[00:33:26.210] [SPEAKER_02]：我记得在《单身地狱》第一季之后，
[00:33:29.370] [SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, this guy was obsessed with this girl.
[00:33:29.370] [SPEAKER_02]：我当时就想，老兄，这家伙对这个女孩简直着迷了。
[00:33:32.150] [SPEAKER_02]: There's like no way that it was all fake. Right.
[00:33:32.150] [SPEAKER_02]：这不可能全是假的。对吧。
[00:33:35.590] [SPEAKER_02]: So I tried to look it up and see, are they still dating?
[00:33:35.590] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我试着查了一下，看看他们是否还在交往？
[00:33:39.530] [SPEAKER_02]: Are they like still hanging out?
[00:33:39.530] [SPEAKER_02]：他们现在还经常一起玩吗？
[00:33:41.290] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's definitely a really big element that makes it so fun
[00:33:41.290] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我觉得这绝对是让它如此有趣的一个重要因素。
[00:33:45.830] [SPEAKER_04]: because other people are just as if not more parasocial than you.
[00:33:45.830] [SPEAKER_04]：因为其他人即便不是比你更像你，也至少和你一样具有准社会性。
[00:33:51.010] [SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's always people like sleuthing and pulling
[00:33:51.010] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，总有人喜欢侦查和调查。
[00:33:53.330] [SPEAKER_04]: like screenshots and like compiling the teeth.
[00:33:53.330] [SPEAKER_04]：就像截图和收集牙齿一样。
[00:33:56.550] [SPEAKER_04]: Like those are my favorite ones, like the summary posts.
[00:33:56.550] [SPEAKER_04]：我最喜欢那种总结性的帖子。
[00:34:00.130] [SPEAKER_04]: But I like recently had a little bit of like a learning moment
[00:34:00.130] [SPEAKER_04]：但我最近经历了一次小小的学习时刻
[00:34:04.930] [SPEAKER_04]: because like I mentioned, I loved my sibling romance.
[00:34:04.930] [SPEAKER_04]：因为就像我之前提到的，我喜欢兄妹恋。
[00:34:08.510] [SPEAKER_04]: So I was fucking obsessed with that shit.
[00:34:08.510] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我当时对那玩意儿简直着迷了。
[00:34:11.290] [SPEAKER_04]: But I think I ruined the experience by like reading the forums and stuff
[00:34:11.290] [SPEAKER_04]：但我认为我看了论坛之类的东西，破坏了体验。
[00:34:15.870] [SPEAKER_04]: because going back to like the whole of someone is obviously there
[00:34:15.870] [SPEAKER_04]：因为回到某人的整个内心显然是存在的。
[00:34:20.530] [SPEAKER_04]: to be like an influencer, it kind of ruins the experience for me.
[00:34:20.530] [SPEAKER_04]：像个网红一样，对我来说有点破坏体验。
[00:34:24.350] [SPEAKER_04]: I think fairly early on in the episodes,
[00:34:24.350] [SPEAKER_04]：我认为在剧集早期，
[00:34:27.570] [SPEAKER_04]: people were already talking about like, oh, this guy has like a track record
[00:34:27.570] [SPEAKER_04]：人们已经在议论纷纷了，比如，哦，这家伙可是有过节的。
[00:34:31.170] [SPEAKER_04]: of trying to become famous.
[00:34:31.170] [SPEAKER_04]：试图成名。
[00:34:33.250] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I was kind of like, if I didn't read that,
[00:34:33.250] [SPEAKER_04]：然后我就想，如果我没读过那篇文章，
[00:34:36.170] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I would be having a better viewing experience.
[00:34:36.170] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得我会有更好的观看体验。
[00:34:38.850] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that sucks.
[00:34:38.850] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，是啊，那太糟糕了。
[00:34:41.390] [SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw for exchange, there were some theories floating around like,
[00:34:41.390] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我看到过一些关于交换的说法，比如，
[00:34:46.610] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my God, like this couple used to be in the entertainment industry.
[00:34:46.610] [SPEAKER_02]：我的天哪，这对夫妇以前好像在娱乐圈混过。
[00:34:50.170] [SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like one of them wanted to get on the show
[00:34:50.170] [SPEAKER_02]：也许他们当中有人想上节目。
[00:34:53.190] [SPEAKER_02]: to like have a second chance at entertainment.
[00:34:53.190] [SPEAKER_02]：就像有第二次机会享受娱乐一样。
[00:34:56.810] [SPEAKER_02]: And then that puts a whole new lens on how you're watching the show.
[00:34:56.810] [SPEAKER_02]：这样一来，你观看节目的方式就有了全新的视角。
[00:35:00.810] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah. And sometimes there's like leaks too,
[00:35:00.810] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊。而且有时候也会出现泄密的情况。
[00:35:04.510] [SPEAKER_02]: which is like very interesting.
[00:35:04.510] [SPEAKER_02]：这很有意思。
[00:35:06.050] [SPEAKER_02]: Now you're watching the show in anticipation of like that leak
[00:35:06.050] [SPEAKER_02]：现在你们都在期待着类似泄露事件的发生，所以才来看这个节目。
[00:35:10.590] [SPEAKER_02]: popping up or something of that sort.
[00:35:10.590] [SPEAKER_02]：突然出现之类的。
[00:35:13.070] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's still like very engaging to just like
[00:35:13.070] [SPEAKER_02]：但我认为它仍然非常引人入胜，就像……
[00:35:17.030] [SPEAKER_02]: find a community of other people who are like just as invested
[00:35:17.030] [SPEAKER_02]：找到一群和你一样投入的人，组成一个社群。
[00:35:21.010] [SPEAKER_02]: as you are and discussing, like, oh my God, that was crazy
[00:35:21.010] [SPEAKER_02]：就像你们刚才讨论的那样，我的天哪，那太疯狂了
[00:35:23.950] [SPEAKER_02]: when this happened in the episode, right?
[00:35:23.950] [SPEAKER_02]：这集里发生这件事的时候，对吧？
[00:35:26.310] [SPEAKER_03]: For me, that's my friend Jen will like immediately talk to each other
[00:35:26.310] [SPEAKER_03]：对我来说，我的朋友Jen会立刻和我聊天。
[00:35:30.310] [SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, did you watch this episode?
[00:35:30.310] [SPEAKER_03]：比如，哦，你看了这集吗？
[00:35:31.770] [SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll send her all the Reddit links and like, it's really
[00:35:31.770] [SPEAKER_03]：然后我会把所有Reddit链接都发给她，真的
[00:35:35.410] [SPEAKER_03]: we corroborate information, collaborate.
[00:35:35.410] [SPEAKER_03]：我们核实信息，合作。
[00:35:39.810] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, also, like some of these people online are so good
[00:35:39.810] [SPEAKER_02]：兄弟，还有，网上有些人真的太棒了。
[00:35:44.170] [SPEAKER_02]: at finding information in exchange.
[00:35:44.170] [SPEAKER_02]：在交流中寻找信息。
[00:35:47.170] [SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the people was an ex-idol.
[00:35:47.170] [SPEAKER_02]：好像其中一人是前偶像。
[00:35:50.610] [SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's just like breadcrumbs of information
[00:35:50.610] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道，信息就像面包屑一样零零散散地存在着。
[00:35:53.070] [SPEAKER_02]: that's being revealed in the show.
[00:35:53.070] [SPEAKER_02]：节目中会揭晓答案。
[00:35:55.350] [SPEAKER_02]: It was mentioned that they were in like a company to train
[00:35:55.350] [SPEAKER_02]：有人提到他们像一家公司一样在那里接受培训。
[00:35:59.390] [SPEAKER_02]: and then they ended up switching companies to debut.
[00:35:59.390] [SPEAKER_02]：然后他们最终换了公司出道。
[00:36:02.950] [SPEAKER_02]: And people like found old videos of them at that like first company.
[00:36:02.950] [SPEAKER_02]: 人们找到了他们在第一家公司时的旧视频。
[00:36:09.250] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, my God, they were like actually a whatever trainee.
[00:36:09.250] [SPEAKER_02]：我当时就想，哦，我的天哪，他们居然是练习生。
[00:36:13.590] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was like, where are you like uncovering these ancient videos from?
[00:36:13.590] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我就想，你到底是从哪里找到这些古代视频的？
[00:36:18.510] [SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy, too, because so I'll like read the Korean forums as well as Reddit.
[00:36:18.510] [SPEAKER_04]：这也很疯狂，因为我也会浏览韩国论坛和Reddit。
[00:36:24.030] [SPEAKER_04]: So as you can imagine, I'm like really deep into like all the fucking goss,
[00:36:24.030] [SPEAKER_04]：所以你可以想象，我完全沉浸在各种八卦里，
[00:36:29.030] [SPEAKER_04]: which is kind of time consuming, actually.
[00:36:29.030] [SPEAKER_04]：实际上，这挺费时间的。
[00:36:30.410] [SPEAKER_04]: But what I find interesting is it's really common for like people to post
[00:36:30.410] [SPEAKER_04]：但我发现有趣的是，喜欢的人发帖真的很常见
[00:36:35.970] [SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, I'm like so and so's high school friend.
[00:36:35.970] [SPEAKER_04]：比如，哦，我是某某的高中朋友。
[00:36:38.330] [SPEAKER_04]: And like, here's all the stuff that I remember.
[00:36:38.330] [SPEAKER_04]：这就是我记得的所有东西。
[00:36:40.730] [SPEAKER_04]: And they'll post like yearbook photos and stuff.
[00:36:40.730] [SPEAKER_04]：他们会发布一些年鉴照片之类的东西。
[00:36:43.650] [SPEAKER_04]: And the crazy thing, too, is coworkers will do that as well.
[00:36:43.650] [SPEAKER_04]：更疯狂的是，同事们也会这样做。
[00:36:47.630] [SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know why, but in Korea, like
[00:36:47.630] [SPEAKER_04]：我不知道为什么，但在韩国，就像
[00:36:51.330] [SPEAKER_04]: oftentimes reality TV is discussed on blind,
[00:36:51.330] [SPEAKER_04]：真人秀节目经常在盲人节目中被讨论，
[00:36:55.570] [SPEAKER_04]: which in the US we use as like a company forum, right?
[00:36:55.570] [SPEAKER_04]：在美国，我们把它当作公司论坛来使用，对吧？
[00:36:59.850] [SPEAKER_04]: Like you have like people talking about compensation and company culture.
[00:36:59.850] [SPEAKER_04]：就像有人在谈论薪酬和公司文化一样。
[00:37:04.410] [SPEAKER_04]: But in Korea, they have like forums on blind where you can talk about shows
[00:37:04.410] [SPEAKER_04]：但在韩国，像Blind这样的网站上有论坛，你可以在那里讨论节目。
[00:37:09.250] [SPEAKER_04]: and entertainment and posts instead of like the commenters username.
[00:37:09.250] [SPEAKER_04]：以及娱乐和帖子，而不是像评论者的用户名一样。
[00:37:13.690] [SPEAKER_04]: It'll also show like, oh, this person is verified to be working at Samsung
[00:37:13.690] [SPEAKER_04]：它还会显示，哦，这个人已被证实是三星的员工。
[00:37:17.510] [SPEAKER_04]: or like this person is verified to be working at this company.
[00:37:17.510] [SPEAKER_04]：或者说，经核实此人确实在该公司工作。
[00:37:20.270] [SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually see that they are coworkers with whoever is being talked about.
[00:37:20.270] [SPEAKER_04]：所以你可以看出，他们和被谈论的人是同事。
[00:37:26.370] [SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like a very fascinating forum culture.
[00:37:26.370] [SPEAKER_04]：所以这就像是一个非常迷人的论坛文化。
[00:37:29.830] [SPEAKER_04]: And I'll like always run to check that to see if there's any like juicy gossip.
[00:37:29.830] [SPEAKER_04]：我总是会跑去查看，看看有没有什么劲爆的八卦。
[00:37:34.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[00:37:34.610] [SPEAKER_03]：哇。
[00:37:34.990] [SPEAKER_03]: Interesting. But it makes sense because there's like a level of verification
[00:37:34.990] [SPEAKER_03]：有意思。但这也说得通，因为这里存在某种程度的验证。
[00:37:38.210] [SPEAKER_03]: that you can get from blind plus like anonymity.
[00:37:38.210] [SPEAKER_03]：你可以从盲加中获得匿名性。
[00:37:42.490] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we should start using blind like that.
[00:37:42.490] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，或许我们应该开始像这样使用盲人了。
[00:37:45.330] [SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we're getting just random Reddit users being like,
[00:37:45.330] [SPEAKER_02]：否则，我们就只能看到一些随机的Reddit用户说，
[00:37:48.250] [SPEAKER_02]: actually, I knew this celebrity in high school.
[00:37:48.250] [SPEAKER_02]：其实，我高中时就认识这位名人。
[00:37:52.590] [SPEAKER_03]: There's something it's very similar to blind called fishbowl.
[00:37:52.590] [SPEAKER_03]：有一种东西和盲人非常相似，叫做鱼缸。
[00:37:55.950] [SPEAKER_03]: That a lot of consultants would use.
[00:37:55.950] [SPEAKER_03]：很多顾问都会用到。
[00:37:58.670] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there were a lot of bulls or like threads for like
[00:37:58.670] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得有很多关于牛市或类似话题的帖子
[00:38:01.990] [SPEAKER_03]: non work related gossip or things.
[00:38:01.990] [SPEAKER_03]：与工作无关的八卦或事情。
[00:38:06.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:38:06.510] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，这很有意思。
[00:38:08.470] [SPEAKER_02]: That's a good use case, actually.
[00:38:08.470] [SPEAKER_02]：这其实是一个很好的应用案例。
[00:38:12.090] [SPEAKER_02]: I never even thought that would be possible.
[00:38:12.090] [SPEAKER_02]：我从未想过这会成为可能。
[00:38:13.910] [SPEAKER_02]: But now that you've like set it into existence, I'm like,
[00:38:13.910] [SPEAKER_02]：但既然你已经把它变成了现实，我就想，
[00:38:17.130] [SPEAKER_02]: oh, that makes so much sense.
[00:38:17.130] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，这很有道理。
[00:38:20.590] [SPEAKER_04]: OK, but I do have a question for you guys.
[00:38:20.590] [SPEAKER_04]：好的，但我有个问题想问大家。
[00:38:23.530] [SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the most fun parts of watching reality TV
[00:38:23.530] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得看真人秀最有趣的部分之一就是
[00:38:26.410] [SPEAKER_04]: is watching it with other people, because not only can you like
[00:38:26.410] [SPEAKER_04]：和别人一起看，因为你不仅可以喜欢它，还可以喜欢它。
[00:38:29.750] [SPEAKER_04]: talk about it and like sound board off your opinions with them,
[00:38:29.750] [SPEAKER_04]：和他们谈谈，就像在论坛上发表你的看法一样，
[00:38:33.230] [SPEAKER_04]: you also start to see people are so different.
[00:38:33.230] [SPEAKER_04]：你也会开始发现人与人之间存在着如此大的差异。
[00:38:36.150] [SPEAKER_04]: Because for me, the archetype of character that I always love
[00:38:36.150] [SPEAKER_04]：因为对我来说，我一直很喜欢的那种角色原型
[00:38:40.850] [SPEAKER_04]: is like the scorned woman.
[00:38:40.850] [SPEAKER_04]：就像被抛弃的女人。
[00:38:42.550] [SPEAKER_04]: She had this like undying love for this guy
[00:38:42.550] [SPEAKER_04]：她对这个男人有着一种永不磨灭的爱。
[00:38:45.290] [SPEAKER_04]: who turned out to be an asshole, but she like stuck it out
[00:38:45.290] [SPEAKER_04]：结果发现她是个混蛋，但她坚持下来了。
[00:38:48.830] [SPEAKER_04]: through the end anyway.
[00:38:48.830] [SPEAKER_04]：无论如何，都要坚持到最后。
[00:38:50.070] [SPEAKER_04]: And I love her because she's stuck to her gun.
[00:38:50.070] [SPEAKER_04]：我爱她，因为她坚持己见。
[00:38:52.150] [SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's me.
[00:38:52.150] [SPEAKER_04]：就像，那就是我。
[00:38:53.750] [SPEAKER_04]: But my husband, he likes like the Chad character,
[00:38:53.750] [SPEAKER_04]：但我丈夫，他喜欢查德这个角色，
[00:38:57.950] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, like the guy who never had like a losing moment
[00:38:57.950] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，就像那种从未经历过失败时刻的人一样。
[00:39:01.130] [SPEAKER_04]: or like a weak moment.
[00:39:01.130] [SPEAKER_04]：或者像一个脆弱的时刻。
[00:39:02.370] [SPEAKER_04]: He was just a Chad from day one all the way to the end.
[00:39:02.370] [SPEAKER_04]：他从第一天到最后都是个十足的查德。
[00:39:06.870] [SPEAKER_04]: So for you guys, what character do you think ends up being your favorite
[00:39:06.870] [SPEAKER_04]：那么，你们觉得哪个角色最终会成为你们最喜欢的呢？
[00:39:10.670] [SPEAKER_04]: on these shows?
[00:39:10.670] [SPEAKER_04]：在这些节目里？
[00:39:12.030] [SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's people who have good emotional intelligence
[00:39:12.030] [SPEAKER_03]：对我来说，是那些情商高的人。
[00:39:15.410] [SPEAKER_03]: from watching this show.
[00:39:15.410] [SPEAKER_03]：来自观看这个节目。
[00:39:17.630] [SPEAKER_03]: So like their interactions with the people in their room,
[00:39:17.630] [SPEAKER_03]：就像他们与房间里其他人的互动一样，
[00:39:20.630] [SPEAKER_03]: they're always kind of the person giving like solid advice
[00:39:20.630] [SPEAKER_03]：他们总是那种能给出中肯建议的人
[00:39:24.090] [SPEAKER_03]: or like how they turn people down or how they like express their feelings.
[00:39:24.090] [SPEAKER_03]：或者像他们拒绝别人的方式，或者他们表达感情的方式。
[00:39:28.370] [SPEAKER_03]: It just feels very mature.
[00:39:28.370] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉非常成熟。
[00:39:31.470] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I can agree with that, too.
[00:39:31.470] [SPEAKER_02]：是的，我也同意这一点。
[00:39:34.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Like having good emotional intelligence,
[00:39:34.230] [SPEAKER_02]：比如拥有良好的情商，
[00:39:37.330] [SPEAKER_02]: having like confidence and like sureness in themselves
[00:39:37.330] [SPEAKER_02]：对自己有同样的自信和确定感
[00:39:41.610] [SPEAKER_02]: so that they're not too wishy washy.
[00:39:41.610] [SPEAKER_02]：这样他们就不会太优柔寡断了。
[00:39:45.050] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I went after this person.
[00:39:45.050] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，我去找这个人了。
[00:39:46.270] [SPEAKER_02]: They rejected me.
[00:39:46.270] [SPEAKER_02]：他们拒绝了我。
[00:39:47.110] [SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to go after this next person like, dude,
[00:39:47.110] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我接下来要对付的这个人，就像，老兄，
[00:39:50.630] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if they're just like they hold themselves in a confident manner,
[00:39:50.630] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得如果他们能保持自信的姿态，
[00:39:54.970] [SPEAKER_02]: if they show kind of weakness in the show,
[00:39:54.970] [SPEAKER_02]：如果他们在节目中表现出某种弱点，
[00:39:57.450] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hate them, but I'm going to be like,
[00:39:57.450] [SPEAKER_02]：我不会恨他们，但我会想，
[00:39:59.510] [SPEAKER_02]: oh, that's like too bad.
[00:39:59.510] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，那真是太糟糕了。
[00:40:00.670] [SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel a bit bad, but they're not going to be my favorite character.
[00:40:00.670] [SPEAKER_02]：你知道吗，我有点难过，但他们不会是我最喜欢的角色。
[00:40:04.850] [SPEAKER_03]: Insecurity, huge it.
[00:40:04.850] [SPEAKER_03]：极度缺乏安全感。
[00:40:09.450] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like there was this girl in exchange
[00:40:09.450] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，就像有个女孩交换一样。
[00:40:12.390] [SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like she was young,
[00:40:12.390] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得她当时很年轻，
[00:40:15.410] [SPEAKER_02]: but she showed a lot of emotional intelligence or like maturity.
[00:40:15.410] [SPEAKER_02]：但她表现出了很高的情商或者说成熟度。
[00:40:18.970] [SPEAKER_02]: If someone wanted to hang out with her or like go on a date with her,
[00:40:18.970] [SPEAKER_02]：如果有人想和她一起出去玩，或者想和她约会，
[00:40:23.310] [SPEAKER_02]: but she was not interested in them.
[00:40:23.310] [SPEAKER_02]：但她对他们不感兴趣。
[00:40:25.050] [SPEAKER_02]: She was just like, no, like I am not really that interested in you.
[00:40:25.050] [SPEAKER_02]：她当时就说，不，我其实对你没那么感兴趣。
[00:40:29.830] [SPEAKER_02]: And she would like call them out if they mistreated her or something.
[00:40:29.830] [SPEAKER_02]：如果他们虐待她，她会公开指责他们。
[00:40:33.770] [SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, that's like that's cool.
[00:40:33.770] [SPEAKER_02]：我当时就想，老兄，这太酷了。
[00:40:36.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's really respectable.
[00:40:36.010] [SPEAKER_02]：这真的很值得尊敬。
[00:40:38.630] [SPEAKER_02]: And she liked one person on the show and she just like stuck to it.
[00:40:38.630] [SPEAKER_02]：她在节目里喜欢上了一个人，然后就一直喜欢他。
[00:40:43.050] [SPEAKER_02]: At least as far as I watched.
[00:40:43.050] [SPEAKER_02]：至少就我看到的而言是这样。
[00:40:45.330] [SPEAKER_02]: I won't say anything.
[00:40:45.330] [SPEAKER_02]：我什么也不说。
[00:40:50.510] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like those are definitely some important elements.
[00:40:50.510] [SPEAKER_04]：是的，我觉得这些绝对是一些重要的因素。
[00:40:54.330] [SPEAKER_04]: I think I also kind of like people who are very polite slash
[00:40:54.330] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得我也挺喜欢很有礼貌的人。
[00:40:59.650] [SPEAKER_04]: there's a phrase in Korean called ttikopta,
[00:40:59.650] [SPEAKER_04]：韩语里有个词叫ttikopta，
[00:41:02.670] [SPEAKER_04]: which basically means you're being like rude or kind of like a bitch sometimes.
[00:41:02.670] [SPEAKER_04]：这基本上意味着你有时很粗鲁，或者有点像个泼妇。
[00:41:06.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't like characters like that.
[00:41:06.610] [SPEAKER_04]：我不喜欢那样的人。
[00:41:08.230] [SPEAKER_04]: I like people who are polite and if they have emotions,
[00:41:08.230] [SPEAKER_04]：我喜欢有礼貌的人，如果他们有感情的话，
[00:41:11.390] [SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't become their like entire attitude for the day.
[00:41:11.390] [SPEAKER_04]：这不会成为他们一整天的全部态度。
[00:41:14.050] [SPEAKER_04]: They are able to slot it away and like process it by themselves
[00:41:14.050] [SPEAKER_04]：他们能够把它放好，然后自己处理。
[00:41:16.710] [SPEAKER_04]: without inflicting it onto others.
[00:41:16.710] [SPEAKER_04]：不给别人带来痛苦。
[00:41:18.850] [SPEAKER_04]: So then I like to seek those people out.
[00:41:18.850] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我就喜欢去找这些人。
[00:41:22.010] [SPEAKER_04]: But it is interesting, too, because sometimes at the beginning,
[00:41:22.010] [SPEAKER_04]：但这也很有趣，因为有时在开始的时候，
[00:41:24.410] [SPEAKER_04]: someone is portrayed a certain way.
[00:41:24.410] [SPEAKER_04]：某人被描绘成某种样子。
[00:41:26.510] [SPEAKER_04]: And then by the end, you're like, oh, like you're not who I thought you were.
[00:41:26.510] [SPEAKER_04]：然后到了最后，你会觉得，哦，你并不是我以为的那个人。
[00:41:30.230] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you put them in an interesting situation and their reaction is so like jarring.
[00:41:30.230] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，你把他们置于一个有趣的情境中，他们的反应却如此令人震惊。
[00:41:35.210] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, wow, they're they're actually like so bothered
[00:41:35.210] [SPEAKER_03]：感觉就像，哦，哇，他们真的好像很在意。
[00:41:39.790] [SPEAKER_03]: or like like they really like went and did that.
[00:41:39.790] [SPEAKER_03]: 或者就像他们真的去了并做了这件事。
[00:41:44.250] [SPEAKER_03]: Like singles in for now, you know, that guy who got rejected like four times
[00:41:44.250] [SPEAKER_03]：就像现在单身的人，你知道，就是那种被拒绝了四次的人。
[00:41:47.830] [SPEAKER_03]: and then he looked like, do you know who I'm talking about?
[00:41:47.830] [SPEAKER_03]：然后他看起来好像在说，你知道我在说谁吗？
[00:41:50.870] [SPEAKER_03]: And his eyes were like,
[00:41:50.870] [SPEAKER_03]：他的眼睛就像，
[00:41:53.230] oh, you want to?
[00:41:53.230] 哦，你想去吗？
[00:41:55.910] [SPEAKER_03]: He was like, he was like over in the corner, just like,
[00:41:55.910] [SPEAKER_03]：他当时就像，他就在角落里，就像，
[00:41:59.810] [SPEAKER_03]: like, I can't believe she rejected me.
[00:41:59.810] [SPEAKER_03]：我简直不敢相信她拒绝了我。
[00:42:02.890] [SPEAKER_03]: Like that was him.
[00:42:02.890] [SPEAKER_03]：就像是他本人。
[00:42:06.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's so funny.
[00:42:06.010] [SPEAKER_02]：真是太搞笑了。
[00:42:07.930] [SPEAKER_02]: I must admit, it sounds like we like the level headed people.
[00:42:07.930] [SPEAKER_02]：我必须承认，听起来我们喜欢头脑冷静的人。
[00:42:11.990] [SPEAKER_02]: But for a good reality TV,
[00:42:11.990] [SPEAKER_02]：但对于好的真人秀节目来说，
[00:42:14.870] [SPEAKER_02]: you need those people who will really react and stir up trouble.
[00:42:14.870] [SPEAKER_02]：你需要那些会真正做出反应并制造麻烦的人。
[00:42:20.210] [SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's like when someone is level headed among drama stirs,
[00:42:20.210] [SPEAKER_02]：所以我觉得这就好比有人在纷乱的事件中保持冷静一样，
[00:42:25.030] [SPEAKER_02]: then it's like a really attractive quality.
[00:42:25.030] [SPEAKER_02]：那这就像是一个非常吸引人的品质。
[00:42:28.050] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[00:42:28.050] [SPEAKER_03]：哦，是的。
[00:42:29.490] [SPEAKER_03]: They shine because there's drama.
[00:42:29.490] [SPEAKER_03]：它们之所以能脱颖而出，是因为有戏剧性。
[00:42:31.970] [SPEAKER_02]: That's true. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:31.970] [SPEAKER_02]：没错。是的，绝对的。
[00:42:34.090] [SPEAKER_02]: I will give the drama creators props like they're probably the real MVPs.
[00:42:34.090] [SPEAKER_02]：我会给剧集制作人点赞，他们可能是真正的MVP。
[00:42:40.230] [SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like you could also be a drama stir,
[00:42:40.230] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得你也可能成为一场风波的制造者，
[00:42:43.870] [SPEAKER_04]: but still get a good edit if you have good interviews.
[00:42:43.870] [SPEAKER_04]：但如果你采访得好，仍然可以得到好的剪辑。
[00:42:47.090] [SPEAKER_04]: So on your like interviews,
[00:42:47.090] [SPEAKER_04]：所以，在你们的采访中，
[00:42:48.290] [SPEAKER_04]: if you're able to explain your thought process in like a very clear way,
[00:42:48.290] [SPEAKER_04]：如果你能非常清晰地解释你的思考过程，
[00:42:52.890] [SPEAKER_04]: it's hard not to sympathize with someone,
[00:42:52.890] [SPEAKER_04]：很难不对某人产生同情心，
[00:42:54.650] [SPEAKER_04]: even if they were being emotional in the moment.
[00:42:54.650] [SPEAKER_04]：即使他们当时情绪激动。
[00:42:56.430] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, I can totally follow their logic
[00:42:56.430] [SPEAKER_04]：感觉就像，哦，我完全能理解他们的逻辑。
[00:42:58.010] [SPEAKER_04]: because they felt this because of that and blah, blah.
[00:42:58.010] [SPEAKER_04]：因为他们因为那件事而有这种感觉，等等等等。
[00:43:00.870] [SPEAKER_04]: So I think oftentimes like even in exchange to some of the more
[00:43:00.870] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我认为很多时候，即使是作为交换，也是为了换取一些更……
[00:43:04.970] [SPEAKER_04]: dramatic people, like I still sympathize with them because I was like, yeah,
[00:43:04.970] [SPEAKER_04]：那些爱演戏的人，我仍然很同情他们，因为我当时想，是啊，
[00:43:09.290] [SPEAKER_04]: I get it. Like, it's like a shitty situation.
[00:43:09.290] [SPEAKER_04]：我明白了。这确实是一种糟糕的情况。
[00:43:12.710] [SPEAKER_04]: And I follow along with what you're saying.
[00:43:12.710] [SPEAKER_04]：我明白你的意思。
[00:43:15.270] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have a question for you all.
[00:43:15.270] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，我有一个问题想问大家。
[00:43:17.990] [SPEAKER_02]: If you could participate in one of the Korean reality TV shows,
[00:43:17.990] [SPEAKER_02]：如果你能参加韩国的真人秀节目，
[00:43:22.410] [SPEAKER_02]: which one would you participate in?
[00:43:22.410] [SPEAKER_02]：你会参加哪一个？
[00:43:26.130] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I would qualify for physical 100 or singles
[00:43:26.130] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得我可能不符合实体100或单曲的资格。
[00:43:29.330] [SPEAKER_03]: inferno or love after divorce yet.
[00:43:29.330] [SPEAKER_03]：离婚后是地狱还是爱情？
[00:43:34.170] [SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like I feel like something like Heart Signal
[00:43:34.170] [SPEAKER_03]：所以我觉得我感觉就像心跳信号一样。
[00:43:38.230] [SPEAKER_03]: would be the most reasonable.
[00:43:38.230] [SPEAKER_03]：这将是最合理的。
[00:43:40.030] [SPEAKER_03]: And that's like a nice wholesome one.
[00:43:40.030] [SPEAKER_03]：那真是一个美好而健康的故事。
[00:43:43.530] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like I would want to do My Sibling Romance,
[00:43:43.530] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，我觉得我会想拍《我的兄妹恋情》这部剧。
[00:43:47.050] [SPEAKER_04]: but I'm an only child, unfortunately, so I wouldn't qualify.
[00:43:47.050] [SPEAKER_04]：但很遗憾，我是独生子，所以我不符合条件。
[00:43:51.950] [SPEAKER_04]: But like, I want to do a show where you go on with someone
[00:43:51.950] [SPEAKER_04]：但是，我想做一个节目，就是你和某人一起上台。
[00:43:55.490] [SPEAKER_04]: because then I feel like it would be less scary.
[00:43:55.490] [SPEAKER_04]：因为那样我觉得就不会那么可怕了。
[00:43:57.770] [SPEAKER_04]: Like you have someone you at least know, right?
[00:43:57.770] [SPEAKER_04]：就像你至少认识某个人一样，对吧？
[00:44:00.310] [SPEAKER_03]: I would love My Sibling Romance actually.
[00:44:00.310] [SPEAKER_03]：我其实很喜欢《我的兄妹恋情》。
[00:44:03.330] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my brother's not single.
[00:44:03.330] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，我哥哥不是单身。
[00:44:04.750] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I was actually thinking that too.
[00:44:04.750] [SPEAKER_02]：嗯，是的，我其实也是这么想的。
[00:44:07.030] [SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I think if I went on My Sibling Romance, it would be hella funny.
[00:44:07.030] [SPEAKER_02]：洛基，我觉得如果我去参加《我的兄妹恋情》节目，那肯定会超级搞笑。
[00:44:11.690] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't think my brother would care at all about like
[00:44:11.690] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我哥哥根本不会在意这种事。
[00:44:15.450] [SPEAKER_02]: who I'm trying to date or something.
[00:44:15.450] [SPEAKER_02]：我正在尝试和谁约会之类的。
[00:44:17.470] [SPEAKER_02]: I think if anything, he would just be like,
[00:44:17.470] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得如果真有什么反应的话，他大概会是这样的，
[00:44:19.430] [SPEAKER_02]: wow, these guys in this house are really funny.
[00:44:19.430] [SPEAKER_02]：哇，这屋里的这些人真有趣。
[00:44:21.830] [SPEAKER_02]: Go for it, I guess.
[00:44:21.830] [SPEAKER_02]：那就去做吧。
[00:44:23.330] Like, you know,
[00:44:23.330] 你知道，
[00:44:24.710] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Loki, I would care a lot, though,
[00:44:24.710] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得我像洛基一样，会非常在意。
[00:44:28.010] [SPEAKER_02]: about like who he's dating.
[00:44:28.010] [SPEAKER_02]：大概就是他正在和谁约会。
[00:44:30.050] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel the same.
[00:44:30.050] [SPEAKER_03]：我也有同感。
[00:44:31.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Elliot has never cared who I dated.
[00:44:31.670] [SPEAKER_03]：埃利奥特从来不在乎我跟谁约会。
[00:44:33.470] [SPEAKER_03]: He just kind of always.
[00:44:33.470] [SPEAKER_03]：他总是这样。
[00:44:35.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure. Like he seems nice.
[00:44:35.570] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，当然。他看起来挺和善的。
[00:44:38.010] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same.
[00:44:38.010] [SPEAKER_03]：是啊，一样。
[00:44:40.090] [SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys need to watch it?
[00:44:40.090] [SPEAKER_04]：你们需要看吗？
[00:44:41.250] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like very interesting.
[00:44:41.250] [SPEAKER_04]：这很有意思。
[00:44:42.870] [SPEAKER_04]: I think unavoidably, since the show features two people from like the same family,
[00:44:42.870] [SPEAKER_04]：我认为这是不可避免的，因为这个节目的主角是来自同一家庭的两个人，
[00:44:48.250] [SPEAKER_04]: they kind of talk about their like family history and stuff.
[00:44:48.250] [SPEAKER_04]：他们会聊聊他们的家族历史之类的。
[00:44:51.390] [SPEAKER_04]: So some of the families will be like divorced parents or,
[00:44:51.390] [SPEAKER_04]：所以有些家庭会是离异父母，或者，
[00:44:54.890] [SPEAKER_04]: you know, some of the families will be like super well off
[00:44:54.890] [SPEAKER_04]：你知道，有些家庭会非常富裕。
[00:44:57.570] [SPEAKER_04]: and like clearly a happy family and whatnot.
[00:44:57.570] [SPEAKER_04]：显然是一个幸福的家庭等等。
[00:44:59.870] [SPEAKER_04]: So they'll dive into their family stories a little bit.
[00:44:59.870] [SPEAKER_04]：所以他们会稍微深入地讲述一下他们的家庭故事。
[00:45:02.270] [SPEAKER_04]: But what's crazy and what that opens the door to is like hate comments.
[00:45:02.270] [SPEAKER_04]：但疯狂的是，这会打开一扇门，导致仇恨评论的出现。
[00:45:08.250] [SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't avoid hate comments, right?
[00:45:08.250] [SPEAKER_04]：好像你无法避免恶意评论，对吧？
[00:45:10.190] [SPEAKER_04]: But on a regular reality TV show, the hate comment might be like,
[00:45:10.190] [SPEAKER_04]：但在普通的真人秀节目中，恶意评论可能是这样的，
[00:45:13.670] [SPEAKER_04]: oh, this person is being a bitch or this person is such an asshole,
[00:45:13.670] [SPEAKER_04]: 哦，这个人真是个泼妇/混蛋，或者这个人真是个混蛋，
[00:45:18.110] [SPEAKER_04]: like blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:18.110] [SPEAKER_04]: 就像……巴拉巴拉巴拉。
[00:45:18.950] [SPEAKER_04]: But what the family stories enable the hate comments to be is like,
[00:45:18.950] [SPEAKER_04]：但是，这些家庭故事之所以会引发仇恨评论，是因为……
[00:45:22.810] [SPEAKER_04]: oh, this person is a bitch because they come from this kind of family
[00:45:22.810] [SPEAKER_04]：哦，这个人真是个贱人，因为她出身于这样的家庭。
[00:45:25.830] [SPEAKER_04]: or like this person clearly has unresolved trauma because his parents are blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:25.830] [SPEAKER_04]：或者就像这个人显然有未解决的创伤，因为他的父母是……
[00:45:30.650] [SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like so insane and like, I think,
[00:45:30.650] [SPEAKER_04]：这简直太疯狂了，我觉得，
[00:45:34.970] [SPEAKER_04]: triply hurtful because you're dragging in like parents
[00:45:34.970] [SPEAKER_04]：三重伤害，因为你像父母一样把事情牵扯进来
[00:45:39.170] [SPEAKER_04]: and their parenting skills and stuff like that.
[00:45:39.170] [SPEAKER_04]：以及他们的育儿技巧等等。
[00:45:42.290] [SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like it is a double edged sword.
[00:45:42.290] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我觉得这是一把双刃剑。
[00:45:44.150] [SPEAKER_04]: Like it is a very wholesome show and like heartwarming to a lot of people.
[00:45:44.150] [SPEAKER_04]：这档节目非常健康向上，能温暖很多人的心。
[00:45:48.130] [SPEAKER_04]: But then the haters just have more ammo and like fuel.
[00:45:48.130] [SPEAKER_04]：但这样一来，那些喷子就有更多的弹药和动力了。
[00:45:51.510] [SPEAKER_03]: That's so fair.
[00:45:51.510] [SPEAKER_03]：这太公平了。
[00:45:52.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not stuff you can change too.
[00:45:52.510] [SPEAKER_03]：好像这不是你能改变的事情。
[00:45:54.890] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[00:45:54.890] [SPEAKER_04]：是的。
[00:45:56.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Going back to how we only see so much of what's happening actually,
[00:45:56.090] [SPEAKER_03]：回到我们只能看到实际发生的事情的一部分这一点，
[00:46:00.470] [SPEAKER_03]: but can form such strong opinions about it.
[00:46:00.470] [SPEAKER_03]：但却能对此形成如此强烈的看法。
[00:46:03.390] [SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not healthy for anyone involved.
[00:46:03.390] [SPEAKER_03]：这对任何相关人员来说可能都不是好事。
[00:46:07.190] [SPEAKER_02]: The editors have so much power of like, yeah, you know, the public's perception of you.
[00:46:07.190] [SPEAKER_02]：编辑们拥有很大的权力，比如，你知道，公众对你的看法。
[00:46:12.770] [SPEAKER_03]: And it's like incentivized for them to create characters out of you.
[00:46:12.770] [SPEAKER_03]：这就像是激励他们把你塑造成各种角色一样。
[00:46:18.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[00:46:18.130] [SPEAKER_03]：好的。
[00:46:18.490] [SPEAKER_03]: So like if you're going to be the person that gets hated,
[00:46:18.490] [SPEAKER_03]：所以，如果你注定要成为被人讨厌的那个人，
[00:46:20.990] [SPEAKER_03]: like they're going to make you look real bad.
[00:46:20.990] [SPEAKER_03]：好像他们要让你看起来很糟糕似的。
[00:46:22.950] [SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[00:46:22.950] [SPEAKER_03]：你明白我的意思吗？
[00:46:23.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:46:23.570] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:46:23.670] [SPEAKER_02]: True.
[00:46:23.670] [SPEAKER_02]：是的。
[00:46:24.770] [SPEAKER_02]: What do you think your personal character would be on a reality show?
[00:46:24.770] [SPEAKER_02]：你认为如果你参加真人秀节目，你的个人性格会是什么样的？
[00:46:29.710] [SPEAKER_03]: Ideally the type of person I like to watch, but I have no idea.
[00:46:29.710] [SPEAKER_03]：理想情况下，我喜欢看他/她这类人，但我不知道。
[00:46:33.530] [SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I feel like Anne would maybe be like the aloof person.
[00:46:33.530] [SPEAKER_02]：等等，我觉得安妮可能是个比较冷漠的人。
[00:46:39.670] [SPEAKER_02]: Like the really funny-
[00:46:39.670] [SPEAKER_02]：就像那些非常搞笑的-
[00:46:40.870] [SPEAKER_02]: Should I give you aloof?
[00:46:40.870] [SPEAKER_02]：我应该对你冷淡吗？
[00:46:42.870] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you would be like the comedy relief, like the really funny person.
[00:46:42.870] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得你会是那种负责搞笑的角色，那种特别幽默的人。
[00:46:50.390] [SPEAKER_02]: Let me revert this.
[00:46:50.390] [SPEAKER_02]：让我撤销这个操作。
[00:46:51.750] [SPEAKER_02]: She looks insulted.
[00:46:51.750] [SPEAKER_02]：她看起来很受侮辱。
[00:46:53.470] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to find love on this show, Crystal.
[00:46:53.470] [SPEAKER_02]：克里斯托，我试图在这个节目里找到爱情。
[00:46:56.990] [SPEAKER_02]: I think you would be like the lovable comic relief.
[00:46:56.990] [SPEAKER_02]：我觉得你会像个讨人喜欢的搞笑角色。
[00:47:01.130] [SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, oh my God, she's so funny.
[00:47:01.130] [SPEAKER_02]：人们会说，哦我的天哪，她太有趣了。
[00:47:04.030] [SPEAKER_02]: Like the honest character?
[00:47:04.030] [SPEAKER_02]：喜欢诚实的性格吗？
[00:47:06.690] [SPEAKER_03]: I do feel like I'm not like competitive when it comes to romance.
[00:47:06.690] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得自己在恋爱方面并不好胜。
[00:47:10.830] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if I were to be on the show, I'd be myself,
[00:47:10.830] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得如果我上这个节目，我会做我自己。
[00:47:13.230] [SPEAKER_03]: try to be friends with everyone and like, you know, come away, you know.
[00:47:13.230] [SPEAKER_03]: 试着和每个人都成为朋友，然后，你知道，走出来，你知道。
[00:47:16.910] [SPEAKER_03]: But if a girl I like liked someone and I was interested in them,
[00:47:16.910] [SPEAKER_03]：但如果我喜欢的女孩喜欢别人，而我对那个人也感兴趣，
[00:47:19.850] [SPEAKER_03]: I would just like let that happen.
[00:47:19.850] [SPEAKER_03]：我只想让事情顺其自然。
[00:47:21.870] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[00:47:21.870] [SPEAKER_02]：哦，有意思。
[00:47:22.910] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's a pretty good character.
[00:47:22.910] [SPEAKER_02]：老兄，这角色塑造得真不错。
[00:47:24.390] [SPEAKER_02]: People would probably love that.
[00:47:24.390] [SPEAKER_02]：人们可能会喜欢那样。
[00:47:25.750] [SPEAKER_02]: They would be like, oh my God, I feel so sorry for Anne.
[00:47:25.750] [SPEAKER_02]：他们会说，哦我的天哪，我真为安妮感到难过。
[00:47:28.490] [SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm rooting for her.
[00:47:28.490] [SPEAKER_02]：我好像在支持她似的。
[00:47:33.010] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, pity points is crazy.
[00:47:33.010] [SPEAKER_04]：老兄，同情分也太疯狂了吧。
[00:47:36.170] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:47:36.170] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:47:36.290] [SPEAKER_03]: Pity points go so hard though.
[00:47:36.290] [SPEAKER_03]：可怜点真的太难得了。
[00:47:38.550] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:47:38.550] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:47:39.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Like post-show success.
[00:47:39.610] [SPEAKER_03]：就像演出后的成功一样。
[00:47:41.430] [SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[00:47:41.430] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。
[00:47:42.090] [SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[00:47:42.090] [SPEAKER_00]：没错。
[00:47:43.510] [SPEAKER_02]: It would be positive pity points.
[00:47:43.510] [SPEAKER_02]：这会博得同情分。
[00:47:45.810] [SPEAKER_02]: It would be like, I love Anne so much.
[00:47:45.810] [SPEAKER_02]：就好像，我非常爱安妮。
[00:47:47.930] [SPEAKER_02]: I just want her to succeed, but she's letting other people succeed.
[00:47:47.930] [SPEAKER_02]：我只是希望她成功，但她却让其他人成功了。
[00:47:53.870] [SPEAKER_03]: So funny.
[00:47:53.870] [SPEAKER_03]：太搞笑了。
[00:47:56.510] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I feel like I could low key see myself being like a shitster.
[00:47:56.510] [SPEAKER_04]：老兄，我感觉自己有点像个混蛋。
[00:48:00.450] [SPEAKER_04]: I think it could go either way.
[00:48:00.450] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得两种结果都有可能。
[00:48:01.650] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I think I would either be like the girl that couples up kind of early
[00:48:01.650] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得我可能会是那种很早就谈恋爱的女生。
[00:48:05.010] [SPEAKER_04]: and then you know those people who just like fizzle out of the show
[00:48:05.010] [SPEAKER_04]：然后你知道，有些人就像昙花一现一样，在节目中销声匿迹了。
[00:48:08.190] [SPEAKER_04]: because they're like in a couple.
[00:48:08.190] [SPEAKER_04]：因为他们就像一对情侣。
[00:48:09.330] [SPEAKER_04]: I would be either that or like a shitster, I think.
[00:48:09.330] [SPEAKER_04]：我觉得我要么会那样，要么会像个混蛋。
[00:48:13.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could totally see that.
[00:48:13.010] [SPEAKER_02]：是啊，我完全能理解。
[00:48:14.910] [SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I don't think I would make good reality TV.
[00:48:14.910] [SPEAKER_02]：老兄，我觉得我不适合上真人秀。
[00:48:18.030] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I would just be so like non-reactive sometimes maybe.
[00:48:18.030] [SPEAKER_02]：我感觉自己有时候可能会变得很冷漠。
[00:48:22.870] [SPEAKER_03]: No, that's funny too in its own way.
[00:48:22.870] [SPEAKER_03]：不，这也有它自己的趣味之处。
[00:48:24.930] [SPEAKER_03]: True.
[00:48:24.930] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:48:25.090] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I would love a character like you.
[00:48:25.090] [SPEAKER_03]：我想我会喜欢像你这样的人。
[00:48:27.610] [SPEAKER_03]: You know when there's like those edits just like zooming into someone's face
[00:48:27.610] [SPEAKER_03]：你知道那种剪辑，就像把镜头拉近到某人的脸上那样。
[00:48:31.950] [SPEAKER_03]: and they're like not, do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:48:31.950] [SPEAKER_03]: 他们就说，不知道，你知道我在说什么吗？
[00:48:34.390] [SPEAKER_03]: They're like thinking about something else.
[00:48:34.390] [SPEAKER_03]：他们好像在想别的事情。
[00:48:37.930] [SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I don't know if you're the type of person to like zone out like that,
[00:48:37.930] [SPEAKER_03]：其实，我不知道你是不是那种会这样走神的人，
[00:48:41.450] [SPEAKER_03]: but that's where I would peg you.
[00:48:41.450] [SPEAKER_03]：但我认为你就是这么定位的。
[00:48:45.270] [SPEAKER_03]: The disassociating person.
[00:48:45.270] [SPEAKER_03]：脱离关系的人。
[00:48:47.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, looking at you like, ah this conversation is stupid.
[00:48:47.190] [SPEAKER_03]: 是啊，看着你，心想，啊，这对话真愚蠢。
[00:48:52.010] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like where's the alcohol?
[00:48:52.010] [SPEAKER_03]：我觉得酒在哪儿？
[00:48:53.850] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:48:53.850] [SPEAKER_03]：是的。
[00:48:55.550] [SPEAKER_03]: Gets up and goes to the kitchen.
[00:48:55.550] [SPEAKER_03]：起身去厨房。
[00:48:59.410] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think this question is very interesting because
[00:48:59.410] [SPEAKER_04]：是的，我认为这个问题很有意思，因为
[00:49:02.310] [SPEAKER_04]: sometimes contestants talk about how like,
[00:49:02.310] [SPEAKER_04]：有时候参赛者会谈论诸如……之类的事情，
[00:49:05.410] [SPEAKER_04]: like I never thought I would be this kind of character,
[00:49:05.410] [SPEAKER_04]：我从没想过自己会变成这种人，
[00:49:07.210] [SPEAKER_04]: but on the show like things are so high stakes that were like so emotional or something.
[00:49:07.210] [SPEAKER_04]：但在节目中，事情的后果非常严重，让人非常激动人心。
[00:49:12.590] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm always like, how bad could it be?
[00:49:12.590] [SPEAKER_04]：然后我总是想，情况能有多糟呢？
[00:49:15.490] [SPEAKER_04]: But also I feel like my emotions fluctuate,
[00:49:15.490] [SPEAKER_04]：但我也觉得我的情绪波动很大，
[00:49:17.910] [SPEAKER_04]: so maybe I could see it getting really bad on the show,
[00:49:17.910] [SPEAKER_04]：所以我觉得节目里情况可能会变得非常糟糕，
[00:49:20.890] [SPEAKER_04]: but it's like one of those things where you never know.
[00:49:20.890] [SPEAKER_04]：但就像有些事情你永远无法预料一样。
[00:49:23.370] [SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe you as a solo person wouldn't get too involved,
[00:49:23.370] [SPEAKER_02]：比如，如果你是一个独行的人，可能就不会太投入其中，
[00:49:27.850] [SPEAKER_02]: but because maybe you like befriended one of the other girls,
[00:49:27.850] [SPEAKER_02]：但或许是因为你和其他女孩中的某个成了朋友，
[00:49:31.610] [SPEAKER_02]: now you're like dragged into the drama too and you're like oh my god, like super invested.
[00:49:31.610] [SPEAKER_02]：现在你也被卷入了这场闹剧，你会觉得，哦我的天哪，你太投入了。
[00:49:36.710] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah or it's like, you know in your real life you have like hobbies and stuff,
[00:49:36.710] [SPEAKER_04]：是啊，或者就像，你知道，在现实生活中你会有一些爱好之类的，
[00:49:40.970] [SPEAKER_04]: so then you're like oh you know like I'm not gonna stress about this,
[00:49:40.970] [SPEAKER_04]：所以你就会想，哦，你知道，就像我不会为此感到压力一样，
[00:49:43.730] [SPEAKER_04]: I'll just go work out or something.
[00:49:43.730] [SPEAKER_04]：我还是去锻炼一下什么的吧。
[00:49:45.030] [SPEAKER_04]: But on the show you're like confined inside this house
[00:49:45.030] [SPEAKER_04]：但在节目里，你就像被困在这栋房子里一样。
[00:49:47.570] [SPEAKER_04]: and there's nothing to do except goss and fight.
[00:49:47.570] [SPEAKER_04]：除了八卦和打架，什么事也做不了。
[00:49:50.510] [SPEAKER_04]: So then maybe you're like okay I'm bored, like fuck it.
[00:49:50.510] [SPEAKER_04]：所以你可能就会想，好吧，我无聊了，去他妈的。
[00:49:55.230] [SPEAKER_04]: At least this is stimulating.
[00:49:55.230] [SPEAKER_04]：至少这令人振奋。
[00:49:56.410] [SPEAKER_02]: Time to stir the pot.
[00:49:56.410] [SPEAKER_02]：是时候搅动一下局面了。
[00:50:00.290] [SPEAKER_04]: Well this has been fun.
[00:50:00.290] [SPEAKER_04]：嗯，这真是一件有趣的事。
[00:50:02.530] [SPEAKER_04]: I think diving deep on reality TV which is like one of my main personality traits slash hobbies.
[00:50:02.530] [SPEAKER_04]：我认为深入研究真人秀是我的主要性格特征/爱好之一。
[00:50:09.250] [SPEAKER_04]: It was always interesting to sit down and talk about reality TV
[00:50:09.250] [SPEAKER_04]：坐下来聊聊真人秀总是很有意思。
