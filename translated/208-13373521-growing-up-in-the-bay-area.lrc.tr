[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. So Jeesoo, I have a word for us to discuss. Oh my god, that rhymed. Alright, let's hear this word.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。Jeesoo，我今天想和大家讨论一个词。我的天，居然押韵了。好，我们来听听这个词。
[00:00:24.260] So it is actually an acronym, which I guess now that we've talked about it enough, Gen Z does use acronyms, just like very sparingly. So the acronym is FR, and it can also be used as BFFR. Ooh, I actually know this one. So faux real or be fucking faux real.
[00:00:24.260] 所以它其实是个缩写，既然我们已经聊得够多了，我想说的是，Z世代确实会用缩写，只是用得很少。这个缩写是FR，也可以写成BFFR。哦，我居然知道这个。意思是“假装真实”或者“他妈的假装真实”。
[00:00:48.940] Yes, exactly. So I think like I've seen this acronym. Top example I can think of right now is like a video is showing something or someone is describing something and it just sounds so unhinged and like unreal that the comments are like, are you for real? So like, are you FR? Or some people will just straight up comment like BFFR. Like basically, I don't believe you, kind of.
[00:00:48.940] 没错，就是这样。我觉得我以前见过这个缩写。我能想到的最典型的例子就是，某个视频里展示着什么，或者有人在描述什么，听起来特别离谱，特别不真实，评论区就会出现“你是认真的吗？”之类的。比如，“你是真的吗？”或者有些人会直接评论“BFFR”。基本上就是“我不信你，大概吧”。
[00:01:17.600] True. I think the first time I heard it too, kind of like live, was when Be Real was really popular. The notification on everyone's phone popped up for like, oh, time to take your Be Real. And then someone was like, oh, BFFR, like it's time to be fucking faux real. Basically like using it to say, let's take our Be Real photos. Yeah. I was like kind of mind blown because I didn't think that it could be applied that way. Right. Like it's time for us to be fucking for real. Yeah.
[00:01:17.600] 没错。我觉得我第一次听到这个说法，也是现场听到的，就是《Be Real》这首歌特别火的时候。大家手机上都弹出通知，说“哦，该拍你的Be Real照片了”。然后有人说，“哦，BFFR”，意思是“是时候做个他妈的假真人了”。基本上就是用它来表示“我们来拍Be Real照片吧”。对。我当时简直震惊了，因为我没想到它还能这么用。对。就像是“是时候做个他妈的真人了”。没错。
[00:01:48.680] To be real. So I guess FR, BFFR, BR. True. Dude, also, this is like slightly going to expose me, but I've been having this really weird new addiction on TikTok. And basically what it is, is it's screenshots of people texting their crush. I read the Korean ones and the American ones, and it's usually like high school students because that's really the age where you have a crush.
[00:01:48.680] 说真的。所以我觉得FR、BFFR、BR都行。没错。哥们，还有，这有点暴露我的秘密了，但我最近迷上了TikTok。基本上就是看别人给暗恋对象发短信的截图。我看了韩国的和美国的，通常都是高中生，因为暗恋这种事确实很常见。
[00:02:17.360] And then beyond that, you know, you don't really have crushes anymore, I feel. But I see the way high school students text each other, I guess, through my addiction of these things. And they use a lot of like shortened words, which I was mind blown. So FR is on there a lot like, oh, are you for real? Or sometimes it's kind of used like, oh, it's so hot outside. And then the other person will be like, FR, like I agree with you for real.
[00:02:17.360] 而且，你知道，我觉得你现在基本不会再有暗恋对象了。但我通过沉迷于这些软件，观察到高中生之间的短信交流方式。他们经常用缩写，这让我大吃一惊。比如“FR”，意思是“哦，你是认真的吗？”或者有时候会用在“哦，外面好热啊。”之类的事情上。然后对方会回复“FR”，意思是“我真的同意你的看法”。
[00:02:44.400] But then sometimes if it's too FR, so it's like FR, FR, then it's like for real, for real. And then it's like, I don't know if it means like, yes, I totally agree with you so much that I want to say FR twice. Or if it's like FR, FR as in like question mark, like are you for real, for real? Oh, that's kind of confusing. Okay. There's so many applications of this acronym. It's like too many. I know.
[00:02:44.400] 但有时候，如果“FR”太多，比如“FR，FR”，那就变成“真的，真的”。然后我就不知道它到底是什么意思了，是像“是的，我完全同意你的观点，所以我想说两遍FR”那样，还是像“FR，FR”那样，像个问号，像“你是真的吗，真的吗？”哦，这有点让人困惑。好吧。这个缩写有很多种用法，简直太多了。我知道。
[00:03:14.180] It's crazy. The other two like shortened words that I saw were ACC, which just means actually. Oh. And I had no idea people use this as like an acronym, which doesn't even make sense because actually it isn't spelled with two C's. Yeah, I was thinking accuracy. Like what? And then the other one was they shortened BRUH. So we type it out typically like B-R-U-H. Yes. But they shorten it to B-R-U.
[00:03:14.180] 太疯狂了。我看到的另外两个缩写词是 ACC，意思是“实际上”。哦。我之前都不知道有人会用这个做首字母缩写，这根本说不通，因为“实际上”这个词的拼写里并没有两个 C。对，我当时想的是“准确”。什么鬼？然后他们还把 BRUH 缩写了。我们通常会把它写成 B-R-U-H。没错。但他们把它缩写成 B-R-U。
[00:03:44.880] And then I was like, this isn't even worth shortening. Okay. There's something that I do sometimes, which I think I've seen other people do it too. But it's like shortening a word to one letter. So like if I were to say like, oh, that's pretty cool over text, I might type like, oh, that's P-cool. I do that too. And I guess pretty, so P, and then very for V, like those are really good ones to do it for. Yeah.
[00:03:44.880] 然后我就想，这根本不值得缩写。好吧。我有时候会这么做，我觉得我也见过其他人这么做。就是把一个词缩写成一个字母。比如，如果我发短信说“哦，这很酷”，我可能会打成“哦，这很酷（P-cool）”。我也这么做。我觉得“pretty”就缩写成“P”，“very”就缩写成“V”，这些词缩写成“V”就很好。嗯。
[00:04:14.520] I've also done like I'm D, like I'm down. True. Oh, and you shorten O to O. Oh, that's true. So drop the H. That's true. Okay. I think because like O without the H is so funny. It's just like literally what your mouth is doing, right? You're like, oh. I also feel like I imagine it as a shorter sound. Like O-H is like O. And then O is like O. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:04:14.520] 我也试过像我这样发“D”音，就像我这样发“down”音一样。没错。哦，还有，你要把O缩短成O。哦，对。所以去掉H。对。好的。我觉得是因为去掉H的O听起来很有趣。就像你嘴巴在做的动作一样，对吧？你会发出“哦”的声音。我也觉得我把它想象成一个更短促的声音。比如O-H听起来像O。然后O听起来像O。对。对。
[00:04:43.520] Dude, O is just too good. It is. I love using just O. Okay. Back to like be real and be fucking for real. Urban Dictionary says BFFR is a saying commonly used by people in the midst of conversation to get the other person to be real with themselves about a specific topic.
[00:04:43.520] 老兄，O 这个词太棒了。真的。我喜欢只用 O。好了。回到正题，说真的，别装了。Urban Dictionary 上说 BFFR 是人们在谈话中常用的一种说法，目的是让对方对自己在某个特定话题上的真实想法坦诚相待。
[00:05:07.960] So I guess that is like another more like convoluted way to use this where it's like BFFR with yourself. I guess I guess it like I guess it like kind of is similar to the don't lie kind of thing. Like I think you're lying. So I guess it's a way of like calling someone out be like be fucking for real because I don't think this is true and you probably know it's not true.
[00:05:07.960] 所以我觉得这算是另一种比较绕口的用法，就像是跟自己说“别撒谎”一样。我觉得它有点像“别撒谎”那种感觉，就像在说“我觉得你在撒谎”。所以我觉得这是一种揭穿别人谎言的方式，就像在说“别撒谎，因为我觉得这不是真的，而且你可能也知道这不是真的”。
[00:05:37.160] Like that kind of angle. Yeah, I can totally see that. And I feel like I don't know where to put it on the aggressiveness scale because on the same scale is like the phrase come on. You know, like you say come on when someone's kind of like BSing you or you feel like they're stretching with the truth. You're just like come on. Yeah. Which isn't that aggressive, but be fucking faux real. Like when you say those actual words out loud, it's like you're you want to fight someone.
[00:05:37.160] 就是那种角度。嗯，我完全明白。我觉得我不知道该怎么形容它的攻击性，因为跟“拜托”这句话在同一个量表上很像。你知道，就像当有人在忽悠你，或者你觉得他们在说谎的时候，你就会说“拜托”。你就是会说“拜托”。对。这本身不算很攻击性，但就是装模作样。当你真的把这些话说出口的时候，就好像你想跟人打一架似的。
[00:06:05.580] But BFFR is kind of in the midpoint, I guess, where it's like slightly more aggressive than come on because it's more straightforward. But yeah, it's enshrouded in like an acronym. So not as bad, maybe. Maybe. And I think I've only seen it in text BFFR. I don't think people necessarily say it in person as much like a BFFR.
[00:06:05.580] 但我觉得BFFR介于两者之间，比“come on”稍微咄咄逼人一点，因为它更直接。不过，它毕竟是个缩写，所以可能没那么糟糕。也许吧。而且我好像只在文字里见过BFFR。我觉得人们在现实生活中不太会像BFFR那样直接说出来。
[00:06:26.760] But I always imagine when I'm reading it that it's like B fucking for like super dramatic with like pauses in between each word. So yeah, it's definitely got like a bit of aggressive factor to it. I guess the one and only time I've ever heard it in real life. It was like, oh, my God, BFFR. And then I was like, what is that? Embarrassing question. I was like, what is that? And then she was like, be fucking faux real. So it didn't feel as aggressive.
[00:06:26.760] 但我读的时候总是想象着，就像“B fucking for”那种超级戏剧化的语气，每个字之间都停顿一下。所以，没错，它确实带点攻击性。我猜我唯一一次在现实生活中听到这个词，当时我就想，我的天哪，BFFR。然后我就问，那是什么？问了个尴尬的问题。我问，那是什么？然后她就说，做个他妈的假真。所以感觉没那么咄咄逼人。
[00:06:54.460] But maybe today's mission will be to use it in our episode at least once. I'll try. I'll try my best. So I guess moving on from our Gen Z word this week, I thought our topic was kind of cute and fun. And I think it'll kind of be a way for us to reflect a little bit on our childhood and how we've seen the environment around us change. So the topic today is talking about life in the Bay Area.
[00:06:54.460] 但也许我们今天的任务就是至少在节目里用到它一次。我会尽力。我会尽我所能。所以，我想，抛开我们这周的Z世代词汇，我觉得我们今天的话题挺可爱也挺有趣的。而且我觉得这能让我们稍微反思一下自己的童年，以及我们周围环境的变化。所以，今天的话题是聊聊湾区的生活。
[00:07:21.060] What are some unique things that we've experienced in the Bay and how we've seen it evolve over the years? So let's kind of kick this off by talking about the different areas in the Bay. How would you describe the different areas that you've lived in or visited? And what are the unique differences for each section? Hmm. So I mostly have spent my time living in the Bay, in the East Bay.
[00:07:21.060] 我们在湾区经历过哪些独特的事情？这些年来，我们又见证了湾区的哪些变化？那么，我们先来聊聊湾区的不同区域吧。您会如何描述您居住或到访过的各个区域？每个区域又有哪些独特的特点呢？嗯，我大部分时间都住在湾区，确切地说是东湾。
[00:07:46.780] I guess it's more like Southeast Bay because I think a lot of people consider Oakland first when they hear East Bay because it's directly east of San Francisco. I think in general, East Bay is kind of considered a little more like older and therefore like slightly more run down, I guess. Just like less new buildings popping up. So a lot of homes are like older and like streets and buildings in general are older.
[00:07:46.780] 我觉得应该说是东南湾，因为很多人一听到东湾首先想到的是奥克兰，毕竟它就在旧金山东边。总的来说，东湾给人的感觉比较老旧，所以也略显破败。新建的建筑比较少，很多房子都比较老，街道和建筑也比较老旧。
[00:08:15.160] I guess it kind of makes sense, too, because it's like mostly suburbs anyway. And I don't think people are trying to like build giant like office buildings really in these areas. Because of that, though, the housing prices are slightly lower compared to other parts of the Bay. Yeah, it's kind of interesting that you say that because so I grew up in the South Bay, specifically like Cupertino area.
[00:08:15.160] 我觉得也挺有道理的，因为那里基本上都是郊区。而且我觉得人们也不会在这些地方建那种巨型办公楼。正因为如此，那里的房价比湾区其他地方略低一些。是啊，你说的挺有意思的，因为我就是在南湾长大的，具体来说是库比蒂诺一带。
[00:08:38.540] I always felt like Cupertino had no, I don't want to say no culture, but kind of no culture. Like there's not a ton of history at Cupertino. And you can tell because our like high school mascot is like a pioneer. And like, I don't know, there's just all of this alluding to like, oh, the gold rush era. Because I feel like that was the last time this area had any sort of history or culture. And then in contrast, I felt like East Bay seemed a little bit cooler to me.
[00:08:38.540] 我一直觉得库比蒂诺没什么文化，我不想说完全没有文化，但就是感觉文化氛围淡薄。库比蒂诺的历史底蕴很浅薄。这一点从我们高中的吉祥物——一个拓荒者——就能看出来。而且，到处都在暗示着淘金热时期。因为我觉得那好像是这片地区最后一次拥有历史或文化的时候了。相比之下，我觉得东湾就酷多了。
[00:09:09.340] Because I don't know, they it kind of seemed like there was more going on. And I think it's changed a little bit now. Definitely when we were in college was when Cupertino started to be like the cool city. But at least when we were in high school, I would like drive up to like Milpitas or Fremont or Pleasanton to like check out all the new dessert places and like the new restaurants. So it's just funny for you to say that. Crystal's making a face right now.
[00:09:09.340] 因为我也不知道为什么，感觉那时候好像更热闹一些。我觉得现在情况有点变化了。我们上大学那会儿，库比蒂诺才开始变得像个很酷的城市。但至少在我们上高中的时候，我会开车去米尔皮塔斯、弗里蒙特或者普莱森顿之类的地方，看看那里新开的甜品店和餐厅。所以你这么说真有意思。克丽丝托现在肯定在做鬼脸。
[00:09:39.400] That's so like funny because we always joke that East Bay, there's like nothing to do. The joke is Fremont never sleeps. And it's like become kind of a meme. But it's it's ironic because like there's literally nothing to do in Fremont. So everyone always sleeps here. Fremont is asleep. But I will say, though, that like Oakland for sure has like ton of culture.
[00:09:39.400] 这真的太搞笑了，因为我们总是开玩笑说东湾没什么可玩的。我们常说弗里蒙特“永不眠”，这都快成梗了。但讽刺的是，弗里蒙特真的没什么可玩的。所以这里的人都睡着了。弗里蒙特就像睡着了一样。不过，我得说，奥克兰的文化氛围确实非常浓厚。
[00:10:06.740] So there's definitely a lot of things happening up there. And I think it's just less techy, maybe. Sometimes it feels like Oakland has its own little subculture. Like they're not as affected by the Silicon Valley tech culture. And there's a lot of just diversity there and like cool things happening. But I don't know. I can't say for sure, because to be honest, I don't spend a ton of time in Oakland. I just stay home all day. No, I totally agree.
[00:10:06.740] 所以那边肯定发生了很多事。我觉得可能科技氛围没那么浓厚吧。有时候感觉奥克兰有自己独特的小圈子，好像没怎么受硅谷科技文化的影响。那里多元化程度很高，也发生了很多很酷的事情。不过我也不确定，因为说实话，我没怎么去奥克兰，我整天都待在家里。是的，我完全同意。
[00:10:34.700] And I was talking to some of my coworkers recently, and some of them have grown up locally. And then others have recently moved here or something. I guess because I mostly stay on like South Bay, a little bit of Peninsula now that I live here, but not so much when I was younger. And like from time to time SF, but not a ton, honestly. They were just like saying all these things about like, oh, like North Bay, like Marin has this. And then saying things like, oh, Berkeley has this and Emeryville has this.
[00:10:34.700] 我最近和一些同事聊天，他们当中有些人是本地人，有些人是最近才搬来的。我猜是因为我平时主要在南湾活动，现在住在这儿也偶尔去半岛地区，但我小时候很少去。偶尔也会去旧金山，但真的不多。他们就说了好多地方，比如北湾，马林县有什么好玩的，还有伯克利有什么好玩的，埃默里维尔有什么好玩的。
[00:11:03.400] And I was kind of like, I have no idea about any of these places because I'm only ever in like two or three cities max, you know? And it especially got bad because I took the BART to work yesterday. I got lost on the way there and I got lost on the way home, which is crazy considering that from like my starting point to like my destination and like back, there's only like two trains. So it's like 50-50 chance. And both times I got the wrong end of the stick.
[00:11:03.400] 我当时就想，我对这些地方一无所知，因为我最多也就去过两三个城市，你知道吗？昨天我坐BART上班，情况就更糟了。去的时候迷路了，回家的时候也迷路了，想想真是不可思议，从我的出发地到目的地再返回，就只有两趟车。所以概率只有一半。结果两次我都搞错了。
[00:11:31.480] So that just shows that, you know, I felt like I had a kind of insulated childhood, even though I was in the Bay, like I don't fully know the entire Bay Area. Yeah, I can agree. Like I probably am pretty similar since you brought up Berkeley. That's definitely also a pretty like lively and bustling city in East Bay, especially because it's a college town. I feel like there's a good amount of things to do and good amount of people always around there.
[00:11:31.480] 所以这说明，你知道，我感觉我的童年有点像与世隔绝，虽然我住在湾区，但我对整个湾区并不完全了解。是的，我同意。既然你提到了伯克利，那我可能也差不多。伯克利绝对是东湾一个非常热闹繁华的城市，尤其因为它是座大学城。我觉得那里有很多好玩的地方，而且总是人来人往。
[00:12:01.480] But like Southeast Bay is very suburb-y. Like Fremont is super suburb-y. Like literally, we used to have a bowling alley in this city and people always joked like, oh my god, that's like the only late night activity in Fremont, like all of Fremont. They actually tore it down in the past five years or so to build more condos. Wait, that's so sad. It's like a piece of your memories.
[00:12:01.480] 但东南湾地区真的很像郊区。弗里蒙特更是超级像郊区。真的，我们这儿以前有个保龄球馆，人们总是开玩笑说，我的天，那简直是弗里蒙特唯一的夜间娱乐场所，整个弗里蒙特都这样。结果，大概五年前，他们把它拆了，盖了更多的公寓。等等，这太可惜了。就像你记忆的一部分。
[00:12:28.560] Yeah, and it was like a very long-standing bowling alley too. So a lot of people were pretty sad. But, you know, just suburb life out, like suburb life on like 200% out here. Wait, no, I know exactly what you mean though. Because when I think back to life in Cupertino, there's like a couple places that people hang out. So one, Cupertino Library, that was like the place to go if you are cool.
[00:12:28.560] 是啊，而且那还是个开了很久的保龄球馆呢。所以很多人都挺难过的。不过，你知道，这就是郊区生活，简直是郊区生活的极致体现。等等，不，我完全明白你的意思。因为回想起在库比蒂诺的生活，那里有几个大家常去的地方。其中一个就是库比蒂诺图书馆，如果你够酷，那那里就是你的必去之地。
[00:12:54.380] So after school, I guess I shouldn't say cool people, but people who wanted to like study and socialize at the same time would all go there and hang out. And then there was like a teen section of the library that everyone would go to. And that's when you would see people from different high schools. And that was kind of like our social life. Which looking back, that is just so hilarious and iconic. Just like the library, you know? That's so nerdy. I'm sorry. Okay, but I have a cooler one.
[00:12:54.380] 所以放学后，我猜我不应该说是“酷哥们”，但那些想边学习边社交的人都会去那里玩。图书馆里还有个青少年专区，大家都会去。在那里你会看到来自不同高中的人。那大概就是我们的社交生活了。现在回想起来，真是太搞笑了，也太经典了。就像图书馆一样，你知道吗？真是太书呆子气了。不好意思。好吧，不过我还有更酷的。
[00:13:22.940] So the other place that you could hang out and like run into everyone there was this boba shop. So this boba shop was across from our high school, but I think a lot of people knew about it. So people from neighboring high schools would always come and like visit. And there you could always see like a bunch of friend groups, people hanging out. Sometimes people would even be like, oh, like we're here, come through. And then like everyone would kind of flock over. So those were probably our two like social hubs.
[00:13:22.940] 所以，另一个可以和大家碰面的好去处就是那家奶茶店。这家店就在我们高中对面，我觉得很多人都知道它。所以附近高中的学生经常会过来串门。在那里总能看到一群群朋友聚在一起。有时候，店员还会说：“哦，我们在这儿，过来一下。”然后大家就会蜂拥而至。所以，这两个地方大概就是我们两个主要的社交中心了。
[00:13:52.940] I'm trying to think what ours were. I think like when we were younger, before we could drive, there was this Taco Bell that was really close to my school. And a lot of kids like passed by it on their way, like walking home or I don't know, going to like a tutoring session or whatever. So that was like a very popular spot. You would see a lot of people there after school getting super cheap, you know, Taco Bell tacos or like burritos or whatever.
[00:13:52.940] 我努力回想我们小时候常去的餐厅是什么样的。我想大概是在我们小时候，还没到开车年龄的时候，我学校附近有一家塔可钟。很多孩子放学回家或者去上辅导课什么的都会路过那里。所以那家餐厅很受欢迎。放学后经常能看到很多人去那里买很便宜的塔可钟墨西哥卷饼或者其他什么墨西哥卷饼之类的。
[00:14:20.580] And in that same plaza, there's like a boba shop. It was like a Tapex. And so a lot of people would hang out there too. Those are like some of the iconic spots way back in the day. But that Taco Bell went out of business, I guess. Oh my gosh. It's just an empty building. I'm not super sure if the boba shop is still there either. Oh my God. Why is like every important landmark from your childhood just gone?
[00:14:20.580] 那个广场里还有一家奶茶店，以前是Tapex那种店。所以很多人也经常去那里玩。那些地方在以前都是标志性的地标。不过那家塔可钟好像倒闭了。我的天哪。现在只剩下一栋空楼了。我也不确定那家奶茶店还在不在。我的天啊。为什么童年记忆里那些重要的地标都消失了呢？
[00:14:51.400] I don't know. I guess to be fair, we had this place called Valco, which was like a little shopping mall, which was also pretty iconic. And we would always run there kind of like what you were saying, like pre everyone having a driver's license. That was like the closest food place or one of the closest ones. So we would fucking sprint there during lunch, get our food, sprint back. But they completely demolished the entire mall. So now there's like nothing in it anymore. Or it's just an empty space basically.
[00:14:51.400] 我不知道。说实话，我们以前有个叫Valco的地方，就像个小型购物中心，也挺有名的。就像你说的，那时候还没人有驾照呢，我们经常跑过去。那是离家最近的餐馆，或者说是最近的餐馆之一。所以午休的时候，我们会一路狂奔过去，买完吃的再跑回来。但是他们把整个商场都拆了。现在里面什么都没有了。或者说，基本上就是一片空地。
[00:15:21.300] Wait, I think I know that mall that you're talking about. It's just like it's like a ghost mall kind of. Yes. And you can go in, walk around in the unlocked areas. But it's just like there's nothing there. I think it was like that a couple years ago. But recently it's like an empty field. Oh, because they like buzzed down or like mowed down everything. Whoa. So it's a little crazy. It's kind of sad actually. Yeah. Like wasn't there, I think there used to be like a movie theater there.
[00:15:21.300] 等等，我想我知道你说的那个商场。它就像个鬼城一样。对。你可以进去，在没锁的区域里走走。但里面什么都没有。我想几年前就是这样。但最近它就像一片空地。哦，因为他们把所有东西都夷为平地了。哇。所以有点疯狂。其实还挺令人难过的。是啊。好像以前那里有个电影院。
[00:15:51.000] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. There was like an AMC. There was like a Victoria's Secret there. Even like a board game store slash like Manga or like, you know, you can get like playing cards there and stuff like that. Yeah. And photo booths. So I have a bunch of photo booth photos from when I was a sixth grader. Because we would always go there with my friends. But now it's just not there anymore. Dang. Wow. I'm surprised it went out of business. Right? That's pretty sad. It is.
[00:15:51.000] 对啊，没错。那里以前有AMC影院，还有维多利亚的秘密，甚至还有桌游店，或者像漫画店之类的，你知道，你可以在那里买到扑克牌之类的东西。对，还有照相亭。我六年级的时候有很多照相亭拍的照片，因为我们以前经常和朋友们去那里。但现在它已经不在了。哎。哇。真没想到它居然倒闭了。是吧？太可惜了。确实。
[00:16:19.500] I will say for us growing up, Great Mall was a popular spot. It's like a little far because it's more Milpitas than like Fremont. It had like the movie theater and it had all the stores. As you remember, Fremont has like nothing.
[00:16:19.500] 就我们小时候来说，Great Mall是个很受欢迎的地方。它有点远，因为它更靠近米尔皮塔斯，而不是弗里蒙特。那里有电影院，还有各种各样的商店。你也知道，弗里蒙特几乎什么都没有。
[00:16:36.960] Actually, one of the really iconic moments I remember in, I think it was either early high school or late junior high, a movie theater opened in Fremont and we were all like so excited. It's the one in Pacific Commons. It's like a century theaters. And so we were like, oh my God, we don't have to like drive all the way to Milpitas anymore. Like we could just, we just go to Pacific Commons now. So I will admit Pacific Commons has like stuff that you can do in Fremont.
[00:16:36.960] 其实，我记得最难忘的时刻之一，大概是在我高中早期或者初中后期，弗里蒙特新开了一家电影院，我们都兴奋极了。就是太平洋购物中心那家，叫世纪影院。我们当时就想，天哪，以后不用开车去米尔皮塔斯了，直接去太平洋购物中心就行了。所以，我得承认，太平洋购物中心确实有很多在弗里蒙特可以玩的地方。
[00:17:06.960] They've like been really active about having new restaurants there and like dessert spots. But I don't know. I guess like we're just so used to complaining that there's nothing to do here that we don't even, we're just like, yeah, there's nothing to do. Where should we go? Not Pacific Commons. Let's go out of Fremont. Oh my God. I know. I feel like when I first started dating James and like being friends with you and some other Fremont people, you know, I would always think like, oh, maybe we should swap. So sometimes we hang out in Cupertino.
[00:17:06.960] 他们最近特别积极地在那儿开新餐厅和甜品店。不过我也不知道。我觉得我们可能已经习惯抱怨这儿没啥可玩的了，以至于我们都习以为常了，觉得“是啊，这儿没啥可玩的。那我们去哪儿呢？别去太平洋购物中心了。咱们离开弗里蒙特吧。”我的天哪。我知道。我觉得我刚开始和詹姆斯约会，和你还有其他一些弗里蒙特的朋友做朋友的时候，我总是会想，哦，也许我们应该互换一下。所以有时候我们会去库比蒂诺玩。
[00:17:37.020] Sometimes we hang out in Fremont when we're all back at home for summer vacation. But all the Fremont people would just be like, okay, we'll come to you. Like we'll always come to you in Cupertino. And I was like, you don't ever want to hang out in Fremont? They're like, no, like you guys are never down to hang out in Fremont, which I thought was so weird. I think we would just be like, yeah, like what would we do in Fremont? Like, please give us a suggestion. And I'm pretty sure if someone did give a suggestion, we'd just be like, no. Yeah.
[00:17:37.020] 有时候暑假我们都回老家的时候，我们会去弗里蒙特玩。但弗里蒙特的人总是说，好吧，我们会去找你们。好像我们总是会来库比蒂诺找你们似的。我就想，你们难道从来不想来弗里蒙特玩吗？他们说，不，好像你们从来不想来弗里蒙特玩似的，我觉得这太奇怪了。我想我们当时会说，是啊，那我们在弗里蒙特能干什么呢？拜托给我们提个建议吧。我敢肯定，就算有人提了建议，我们也会说，不。是啊。
[00:18:07.580] Exactly. Like, what if we went to Meat Fresh in Pacific Commons? We'd be like, no, there's a Meat Fresh in Cupertino. I think a lot of times we did go to that Meat Fresh in Cupertino. But what you said earlier kind of reminded me of, you know, before we had licenses, getting around was kind of one of the big things you had to solve for when trying to hang out with friends. And I remember usually one of the moms would like drive and pick us up.
[00:18:07.580] 没错。比如说，如果我们去太平洋购物中心的Meat Fresh肉店呢？我们就会说，不行，库比蒂诺也有一家Meat Fresh。我想我们很多时候确实去了库比蒂诺那家Meat Fresh。但你刚才说的让我想起了，在我们还没拿到驾照的时候，出行是和朋友出去玩时必须解决的大问题之一。我记得通常是妈妈开车来接我们。
[00:18:36.160] But one of the things that I remember is not every mom could drive as in like, you know, sometimes moms are working or they're not at home. And I don't know if this is unique to Korean moms or just, I guess, more recent immigrant moms or something like that. But some of the moms of my friends weren't super comfortable like driving in general, especially like highway stuff. If we were trying to go somewhere far, they would be kind of hesitant to do so.
[00:18:36.160] 但我记得很清楚的一点是，并不是每个妈妈都会开车，你知道，有时候妈妈们要上班或者不在家。我不知道这种情况是韩国妈妈特有的，还是只是新移民妈妈们普遍存在的。但我朋友的一些妈妈不太会开车，尤其是在高速公路上。如果我们要去比较远的地方，她们就会有点犹豫。
[00:19:02.600] So I remember once my mom was like so tired of always being the only mom driving. And she was like, I'm not like a taxi driver. So sometimes maybe like your friend's mom should drive too. And I was like, oh. You're like, my bad for always volunteering you, mom. I know. And if I think about it at the time, I don't think I ever really like asked my friends as much of like, oh, can your mom drive this time?
[00:19:02.600] 我记得有一次，我妈特别累，因为她总是独自开车。她说：“我又不是出租车司机，所以有时候你朋友的妈妈也可以开车。” 我当时就说：“哦，妈，我真不好意思，总是让你来帮忙。” 我知道。现在想想，我好像从来没问过我的朋友们：“这次你妈妈能开车吗？”
[00:19:29.880] Like, I think I actually did probably volunteer my mom, which is like, you know, my mom's perspective. She's like, why does it always have to be me? But it's just so funny looking back at what a shithead kid I was kind of. Damn. No, I feel that though. I think like my mom tended to be more available as well because my dad sometimes would work a little later in the day. And so she would be like the one driving us around and stuff.
[00:19:29.880] 我觉得我当时可能真的让我妈“自愿”帮忙了，这大概就是我妈的视角吧。她会想，为什么总是我？但现在回想起来，我小时候真是个混蛋，真是太搞笑了。哎。没错，我也有这种感觉。我觉得我妈也比较有空，因为我爸有时候会工作到很晚。所以她就经常开车送我们到处跑什么的。
[00:19:58.000] But in terms of like hanging out, I think I would just be like, I can't hang out. Like, I can't hang out. No one can drive me. But I can hang out if like it's walkable. I think that's like in my memory what my default was a little more often. But there's definitely been times, of course, where like my mom has driven me or someone else's parents have picked me up.
[00:19:58.000] 但说到出去玩，我觉得我可能就没法出去玩了。真的没法出去玩。没人能开车送我。但如果是步行就能到的地方，我倒是可以。我记得以前我好像经常都是这样。当然，也肯定有那么几次，我妈开车送我，或者其他人的父母来接我。
[00:20:24.820] But I totally resonate with that mom's being scared on the road, I guess. I think because my mom actually didn't drive before we moved to America. And so once she was in America, she was like, oh, it makes sense if I learn to drive. It would be ideal for the family and just make things easier. So she had to like learn to drive. And at that time, she's what, like probably near 40 or so.
[00:20:24.820] 但我完全能理解那位妈妈在路上害怕的心情。我想是因为我妈妈在搬到美国之前根本不会开车。所以她到了美国之后，就觉得，哦，我应该学开车。这对家里来说太方便了，也更省事。所以她就得学开车。那时候，她大概快40岁了吧。
[00:20:53.660] Like learning to drive for the first time and like, you know, spending the time to become comfortable on the road. And everything. So my mom also only really drove nearby, like small distances. I guess it's something that we take for granted, like growing up in the U.S. where I think by like 15, I was like, I'm ready to drive, like throw me out there on the road. But in a lot of countries or maybe I guess even some cities, like it's not necessarily needed to drive. So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:20:53.660] 就像第一次学开车，你知道，要花时间适应路况。等等等等。所以我妈妈也只在附近开车，短途就行。我觉得这在我们看来是理所当然的，就像在美国长大一样，我大概15岁的时候就觉得“我准备好了”，然后就把我扔到路上去了。但在很多国家，甚至一些城市，开车并不是必需的。所以这很有道理。
[00:21:22.300] Yeah, because in like in China, at least, taxis so available. So you can definitely get away with like not ever learning to drive, especially if you're in like a pretty populous city. Yeah, I guess if like public transportation too is good, like subwaying or trains from city to city even, you're pretty much set. Yeah.
[00:21:22.300] 是啊，因为至少在中国，出租车到处都是。所以你完全可以不用学开车，尤其是在人口密集的城市。嗯，我想如果公共交通也很便利，比如地铁或者城际火车都很方便，那就基本没问题了。是的。
[00:21:41.700] But I think one of the things that I'm recalling now is there's also kind of like a different culture or like vibe that you get with each mom who's driving. So I remember once my friend's mom actually volunteered to drive us. She had picked us up from school and like was taking us back or something. I think my mom had some errands to run. And then she was like, oh, do you guys want to stop by McDonald's? And I was like floored because we never went to McDonald's.
[00:21:41.700] 但我现在想起来的一件事是，每个开车的妈妈似乎都有一种不同的文化氛围。我记得有一次，我朋友的妈妈主动提出开车送我们。她从学校接我们，正要送我们回去什么的。我妈好像还有事要办。然后她就问，你们想不想顺便去麦当劳？我当时就懵了，因为我们从来没去过麦当劳。
[00:22:10.140] I think the only fast food place we really ate was like KFC. I think I remember being like, oh, isn't McDonald's kind of unhealthy? And then she was like, oh, you can just get like a chicken wrap. And then I had the chicken wrap. I think it used to be called like a snack wrap or something. And my mind was fucking blown because it was so good. I was like, whoa, other families like just stop by McDonald's on the way home. You know what I mean? Oh, my God. Wow. That's crazy.
[00:22:10.140] 我觉得我们家唯一真正吃过的快餐店就是肯德基。我记得当时我还想，麦当劳是不是不太健康？然后她就说，哦，你可以点个鸡肉卷啊。然后我就点了鸡肉卷。我记得它以前好像叫什么小食卷之类的。我当时简直惊呆了，因为它太好吃了。我就想，哇，其他家庭居然会在回家路上顺便去麦当劳买点东西。你懂我的意思吗？我的天哪。哇。太不可思议了。
[00:22:39.680] Maybe your parents were like, yo, KFC, Korean fried chicken. They're like, this is my culture. My family is actually a big McDonald's fan because it was also in Canada. So when we were growing up, sometimes we would just be like, fuck it, dude. Let's just get McDonald's. It's like so cheap. And my dad loves the Big Mac. And like, you know, kids meal with the toys and everything. Right.
[00:22:39.680] 也许你爸妈会说：“哟，肯德基，韩式炸鸡。”他们会说：“这是我们的文化。”其实我家是麦当劳的铁杆粉丝，因为加拿大也有麦当劳。所以我们小时候，有时候就会说：“算了，哥们儿，咱们去吃麦当劳吧。”反正又便宜。我爸最爱吃巨无霸。还有那种儿童套餐，里面有玩具什么的。对吧。
[00:23:09.320] And I think also just one of the biggest things was that it's just so cheap. I mean, nowadays it's more expensive, but still like in terms of relativity, it's still pretty cheap. Okay. Actually, since you spent a little more time growing up in California than I did, do you feel like In-N-Out was a big thing for your family because it's so like cheap and readily available? Yeah, it definitely was. But the way my family approached like fast food was really specific. I have a couple of theories.
[00:23:09.320] 我觉得最重要的一点就是它真的太便宜了。当然，现在价格是贵了，但相对来说还是很便宜的。好的。其实，你在加州长大的时间比我长，你觉得In-N-Out对你家来说是不是很重要，因为它又便宜又容易买到？是的，确实很重要。但我家对快餐的态度很特别。我有一些想法。
[00:23:36.880] So like one, my mom didn't work for like a decent chunk of my childhood. She did when I was older, but definitely when I was younger, she didn't work. And also, I'm an only child. So I feel like maybe you have the urge more to be like, okay, let's just stop by McDonald's and like shut these kids up with like fast food or something if there's two kids crying in the back. But if it's just one, you know, maybe it's more manageable. That's a good point. I can totally see the logic there.
[00:23:36.880] 比如，我小时候，我妈大部分时间都没工作。我长大些她才开始工作，但我小时候她肯定没工作。而且，我是独生子。所以我觉得，如果后厨有两个孩子哭闹，你可能更倾向于想，好吧，咱们去麦当劳吃点快餐什么的，让他们安静下来。但如果只有一个孩子哭，那就比较容易处理。你说得对，我完全理解你的想法。
[00:24:06.540] But back to In-N-Out, we did get it, but we only really got it when we went to Gilroy shopping outlets to shop. And then the In-N-Out and Cupertino isn't very good. Like the Gilroy one is fucking fire, like on the same level as the Kettleman City In-N-Out. But the Cupertino one is like eh. So we just didn't go to the local one as much. I see. I see. I actually don't know if I've ever taken my parents to In-N-Out now that I'm thinking about it. Oh my God.
[00:24:06.540] 不过说回 In-N-Out，我们确实吃过，但只有去吉尔罗伊购物中心逛街的时候才会吃。库比蒂诺那家 In-N-Out 就一般般。吉尔罗伊那家简直棒极了，跟凯特尔曼城那家差不多。但库比蒂诺那家就一般般。所以我们就没怎么去本地那家。我明白了。我明白了。仔细想想，我好像都没带我爸妈吃过 In-N-Out。我的天哪。
[00:24:36.480] I think I will have to make sure to do that sometime this year. Yeah, that's like California culture right there. Yeah. Because like now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure. Like maybe my dad's eaten it with like coworkers or something, but I'm not sure if my mom has ever had it. Okay, I'll be sure to like make them eat it sometime. But yeah, I feel like that's like a suburb thing kind of maybe.
[00:24:36.480] 我觉得今年我得找个时间尝尝。对，这算是加州文化的一部分吧。嗯。因为现在想想，我又不太确定。可能我爸跟同事吃过什么的，但我不确定我妈有没有吃过。好吧，我一定要找个时间让他们尝尝。不过，我觉得这大概是郊区居民才会有的习惯吧。
[00:25:03.750] Maybe even if it's just fast food, it's like, oh my God, we're like eating out versus I imagine like in the city, there's just so much more food options available for you if you're like looking to eat out. I feel like in the suburbs, it's like, okay, I guess like we can look really hard to find something that's enticing or we could just drop by McDonald's. Yeah, that's true.
[00:25:03.750] 就算只是快餐，也会觉得，天哪，我们居然在外面吃饭了。我觉得在城市里，如果你想出去吃，选择就多得多。我觉得在郊区，就好像，好吧，我们可能要费很大劲才能找到什么好吃的，或者干脆去麦当劳。是啊，确实如此。
[00:25:28.450] I think when we all did start to have licenses, I don't know how relevant this was for you, but there's just like nothing you can do in Cupertino really. It's literally like that boba shop and the library and like this other coffee shop that people would go to. So the other alternative is to go to like random plazas or like random restaurants or whatever, like Taco Bell sometimes and just like sit there. And I feel like looking back, it's kind of like loitering, but I think that's just what high school kids do.
[00:25:28.450] 我觉得当我们都开始拿到驾照的时候——我不知道这对你来说有多重要——在库比蒂诺真的没什么可做的。除了那家奶茶店、图书馆和另一家咖啡馆，就没什么其他去处了。所以，另一个选择就是去一些不知名的广场、餐厅之类的，有时候去塔可钟之类的，然后就坐在那儿。现在回想起来，我觉得这有点像游荡，但我觉得高中生就是这样。
[00:25:56.910] And I don't know why, but back in high school, I feel like you could go to any restaurant and you would see people you know. Do you know what I'm talking about? I think for sure, especially because it's like you're going to school with these people. So, you know, you're all within like a certain vicinity of each other. And then there's just like certain hotspots in the area. For Fremont, one of the big hotspots back in the day was Sweet Tomatoes before it closed down. I think I've seen like families eat there quite a few times.
[00:25:56.910] 我也不知道为什么，但高中那会儿，感觉随便去哪家餐厅都能碰到熟人。你懂我的意思吗？我觉得肯定懂，尤其因为你们都在同一所学校。所以，大家都在同一个区域活动。而且，附近还有一些比较热门的餐厅。比如弗里蒙特，以前很火的餐厅之一就是Sweet Tomatoes，可惜后来关门了。我好像见过好几次一家人去那里吃饭。
[00:26:26.730] Oh, interesting. I think for us, it was probably more like the key boba shops and stuff. And more and more boba shops opened up, but usually I think of it almost as like plazas. Like the plaza where Marukai was, I would always see people there. And the reason I even brought it up was like this was probably one of the college breaks that I came back home. But I just remember my friends and I went to In-N-Out and I was like, oh, hope we don't bump into anyone at In-N-Out.
[00:26:26.730] 哦，有意思。我觉得对我们来说，可能更像是那些标志性的奶茶店之类的。奶茶店越来越多，但我通常觉得那里更像是广场。比如丸海餐厅所在的那个广场，我总能在那儿看到人。我之所以提起这个，是因为那大概是我大学放假回家的时候。我记得我和朋友们去了In-N-Out，当时我就想，哎，希望别在In-N-Out碰到人。
[00:26:55.450] And then we literally saw like a bunch of people we knew just like there for different reasons. Like someone behind the counter was someone we knew. My ex was there. I literally was like, what the fuck? Like this is why I hate coming back home because everyone everywhere is like someone you know or like a friend of a friend. Oh, that's so true. Right? Your In-N-Out story. I'm pretty sure I've had something very similar to that. Like we walk into In-N-Out at like 10 p.m. for some reason, only people you know are in In-N-Out.
[00:26:55.450] 然后我们真的看到好多认识的人，他们来这儿的原因各不相同。比如柜台后面的人就是我们认识的。我前任也在。我当时就想，这他妈什么情况？这就是我讨厌回家的原因，因为到处都是熟人，或者朋友的朋友。哦，太对了。对吧？你的In-N-Out经历。我肯定也遇到过类似的情况。比如晚上十点左右，我们走进In-N-Out，不知道为什么，里面全是熟人。
[00:27:26.810] Oh, my God. I think like there are times where it's like kind of cool and you're like, oh, shit, it's been so long. And then there are other times where you're like, the last thing I want to happen today is like to run into these random people I have to make shitty small talk with. And it's always like the second type of day where things like this actually happens to you.
[00:27:26.810] 我的天哪。我觉得有时候会觉得挺酷的，你会想，哎呀，好久不见了。但有时候你又会想，今天最不想遇到的就是这些陌生人，还得跟他们进行无聊的闲聊。结果这种事总是发生在后一种情况下。
[00:27:44.850] I feel like this stuff happened a lot more during like college years when everyone was back visiting, like you said, or during like high school when more and more people were starting to get their licenses. Yeah, that's true. I guess because back then it was kind of like cool to go out. I feel like people made more of a point to like go out and like hang out. And plus, you only have so much time to like see your hometown friends back home.
[00:27:44.850] 我觉得这种事在大学时期，大家都回家探亲的时候，或者像你说的，高中时期，越来越多的人开始考驾照的时候，发生的频率要高得多。对，确实如此。我想是因为那时候出去玩挺酷的。我觉得大家更重视出去玩，和朋友们聚聚。而且，你回老家见老朋友的时间也就那么长。
[00:28:12.390] So maybe that's why it was so common. But it does make me feel a little bit old now when I go to plazas where I used to be like, oh, my God, I'm going to see someone I know. And then I'm like looking around and I don't see a single familiar face. I'm like, I'm old and irrelevant now. Although I will admit that it still happens, but just like maybe less so out and about. It's more like at events or gatherings that I feel like these bump ins occur more often now.
[00:28:12.390] 所以也许这就是为什么以前这种事那么常见。但现在我去以前常去的广场，总会想着“天哪，我肯定能碰到熟人”，结果环顾四周却一个熟面孔都没看到，这让我感觉自己有点老了。我就想，我老了，也跟不上时代了。虽然我承认这种情况还是会发生，只是在街上少了很多。感觉现在在活动或聚会上更容易碰到熟人。
[00:28:42.470] And I guess it's kind of like a thing about just living in. I mean, we say that like it's pretty Bay Area specific sometimes that like everyone knows everyone or like everyone knows someone who knows someone. But maybe it's also just like a small town kind of thing. I don't know if our cities count as small towns, though, but it's sometimes it really feels like it. That's true.
[00:28:42.470] 我觉得这有点像是生活本身就带有一定的特点。我的意思是，我们有时会说，这种现象在湾区很常见，好像每个人都互相认识，或者每个人都认识某个认识某个人的人。但也许这也有点像小镇的感觉。我不知道我们所在的城市算不算小镇，但有时确实感觉像。确实如此。
[00:29:08.630] It does feel like in our childhood it was more of a small town and now it feels bigger. I don't know if maybe we just know more of the world now or something. But, you know, I do feel like there's been a lot more development and stuff that makes the city slightly different when you look at it now. I don't know how much you feel this way about Fremont. But Cupertino definitely in the last 10 years has changed a lot. Some parts of it I don't even recognize anymore. And it's even like the roads.
[00:29:08.630] 感觉小时候这里更像个小镇，现在却感觉大了不少。我不知道是不是因为我们现在对世界了解得更多了。但你知道，我确实觉得这里发展了很多，让这座城市看起来和以前不太一样了。我不知道你对弗里蒙特是不是也有这种感觉。但库比蒂诺在过去十年里变化真的很大。有些地方我都认不出来了。就连道路都变了。
[00:29:35.050] Like, you know, when you're younger, you always go on the same roads with your parents so you know exactly what each street looks like. I feel like I just don't have that same sense of familiarity anymore. And it makes me a little bit sad.
[00:29:35.050] 你知道，小时候，你总是和父母走同样的路，所以你对每条街的样子都了如指掌。我觉得我现在没有那种熟悉感了。这让我有点难过。
[00:30:15.070] Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.
[00:30:15.070] 啊。啊。啊。啊。啊。
[00:30:46.770] Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.
[00:30:46.770] 啊。啊。啊。啊。啊。啊。啊。
[00:31:18.290] Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.
[00:31:18.290] 啊。啊。啊。啊。啊。
[00:31:46.530] including food, transportation, all of that? No. I don't know that book. Shoot, I can't remember. It's giving me what the title was, but I guess in some ways the cities that you mentioned are sort of like that where there are times where I'm talking to someone who works in tech and there's things in my life that I have to do and pay for. For example, I have to drive to work or I have to pay for the Caltrain. I have to buy my lunch. On some days I don't anymore,
[00:31:46.530] 包括食物、交通等等吗？不，我没看过那本书。哎呀，我记不起来了。它给了我书名，但我想你提到的那些城市在某种程度上有点像那样，有时候我和在科技行业工作的人聊天，而我生活中也有一些事情是必须做、必须花钱的。比如，我得开车上班，或者得付加州火车票钱。我得自己买午饭。有些时候，我不用再自己买了。
[00:32:11.930] but usually I have to buy my lunch and then I have to go home and I have to cook dinner and then I have to go to the gym and then pay for the gym. But you talk to a tech worker and they're like, oh yeah, I just take the company bus to work and then on it there's free Wi-Fi and then I use a free company gym or I get a stipend for a gym and then I eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then have
[00:32:11.930] 但通常我得自己买午饭，然后回家做晚饭，再去健身房，还得付健身房会员费。但你跟一个科技工作者聊聊，他们会说，哦，对啊，我直接坐公司班车上班，车上有免费Wi-Fi，然后可以用公司提供的免费健身房，或者公司会给我健身补贴，然后我吃早饭、午饭、晚饭，然后……
[00:32:37.250] a little take-home dessert at work. And I'm just like, what the fuck? Your life is not real. You know what I mean? You're like, be fucking for real. Yeah, BFFR. Yeah, it's really something. And before I heard about how it was affecting the city's economy and stuff, I didn't think much about it. I was just like, oh my god, that sounds awesome.
[00:32:37.250] 上班的时候带点甜点回家吃。我当时就想，卧槽？这生活也太不真实了吧。你懂我的意思吗？感觉就像在说，拜托，认真点儿。对，BFFR（Big Fuck For Revisited，兄弟情谊）。是啊，这事儿真够奇葩的。在我听说它对城市经济的影响之前，我都没怎么在意。我当时就觉得，我的天，听起来真棒。
[00:33:00.770] Like, people can just go to work, eat at work, and save so much money. But then now I'm like, oh, okay, there are definitely downsides to it as well. It's hard on the city sometimes. But I guess also it's good for the city in other ways. So for example, Sunnyvale, it used to be a city of nothing when we were younger. Low-key, there's just nothing there.
[00:33:00.770] 比如，人们可以上班，在公司吃饭，省下很多钱。但现在我想，哦，好吧，这肯定也有缺点。有时候对城市来说很艰难。但我想，从其他方面来说，这对城市也有好处。比如说，桑尼维尔，在我们小时候，它还是个荒凉的城市。说实话，那里什么都没有。
[00:33:25.070] There's no schools there. So they didn't have a ton of property value either. But lately, because of the whole tech culture and startups and things like that, a lot of companies started moving into Sunnyvale. And now Sunnyvale is much more developed than it was before. There's a lot more offices there. A lot more people want to live there because it's close to work. And because
[00:33:25.070] 那里没有学校，所以房产价值也不高。但最近，由于科技文化和创业公司的兴起，很多公司开始迁往桑尼维尔。现在桑尼维尔比以前发展得好多了，办公楼也多了很多，更多的人想住在那里，因为离工作地点近。
[00:33:50.230] there's people who are living there, new buildings, condos or townhomes, all that kind of stuff are being built. So I guess there's the pros and cons of having such huge companies take over such large portions of the bay. Yeah, that's true. It really does do something funny to the house prices and the values and stuff. I remember for a while, people were freaking out during the pandemic because with
[00:33:50.230] 那里已经有人居住，新建的楼房、公寓或联排别墅等等都在兴建。所以我觉得，让这么大的公司接管海湾这么大的区域，有利有弊。没错，确实会对房价和房产价值产生一些影响。我记得疫情期间，人们一度非常恐慌，因为……
[00:34:19.970] remote work and no kind of like return to office date set at the time, people were freaking out about, oh, what's it going to do to the housing market? And now I think it's more settled with RTO and such. But the other interesting aspect of a city being completely dominated by like a company is I do feel like certain companies try a little harder to like uplift the community around them. The city that I currently live in, it's not necessarily as iconic of like, oh, this company owns the city, but it's kind
[00:34:19.970] 当时远程办公盛行，而且也没有设定明确的返岗日期，大家都很担心这会对房地产市场造成什么影响。现在随着远程办公模式的推行，情况似乎稳定下来了。但另一个有趣的现象是，当一座城市完全被一家公司掌控时，我感觉某些公司会更加努力地提升周边社区的福祉。我目前居住的城市，虽然不像某些公司那样具有标志性意义，比如“这家公司拥有整座城市”，但它确实……
[00:34:49.770] of close to one of those cities. And Meta will constantly throw like community events in our neighborhood park. And it's like all throughout summer and it's pretty big events. They'll get a lot of local vendors and stuff to come. So people do get pretty excited for it. And I think it's cool. We're at a time where if we wanted to, like no one would ever have to leave the house ever and everyone would be forever entertained. But you know, throwing small things like that does get a community to kind
[00:34:49.770] 我们这儿离其中一个城市很近。Meta经常在我们社区公园举办社区活动。整个夏天都有，而且规模都挺大的。他们会邀请很多本地商贩来，所以大家都很期待。我觉得这很棒。现在，如果我们愿意，大家完全可以足不出户，永远享受娱乐。但是，你知道，举办这样的小活动确实能让社区更加友好。
[00:35:17.830] of join together and like have fun and enjoy their summers. So I guess that's one of the benefits of corporate gentrification. Yeah. Wait, that's cool. I never knew that they did stuff like that. So anyone can go to those events. Yeah. Oh my God. Could you imagine they're like, show your badge and then you could enter. They're like free beer only if you show your employee badge.
[00:35:17.830] 大家聚在一起，玩得开心，享受夏天。所以我想这算是企业化带来的一个好处吧。是啊。等等，这太酷了。我以前都不知道他们会搞这种活动。所以任何人都可以参加这些活动。是啊。我的天哪。你能想象吗，他们会说，出示你的工牌才能进去。就像只有出示员工工牌才能免费喝啤酒一样。
[00:35:43.790] Yeah, exactly. I guess like another thing kind of going back to our youth growing up in the Bay. And I think it's still like kind of applicable now is the fact that we do have like a city that people will commute up to and like make trips to. And we call it the city too. So it's like SF. I think that's also really funny because one time I think I was talking to my friend and I was saying
[00:35:43.790] 对，没错。我觉得还有一点，这可以追溯到我们在湾区长大的童年。我觉得这一点现在仍然适用，那就是我们确实有一个城市，人们会通勤到那里，或者去那里旅行。我们也称它为“城市”。就像旧金山一样。我觉得这很有趣，因为有一次我和朋友聊天，我说……
[00:36:11.630] like, oh yeah, I was like in the city the other day and they're like, oh wait, do you mean SF or New York? And I was like, dude, New York, obviously. What are you talking about? But then I was like, that's right. We call SF the city here in the Bay Area. Right. Dude, I remember like I had to teach myself how to do that because in Korean, like my parents always say, oh, like we're going to go to San Fran, which I guess in the English way, it's like San Fran. So I thought everyone said that. And
[00:36:11.630] 比如，哦，对，前几天我在城里，他们就问我，等等，你是说旧金山还是纽约？我说，老兄，当然是纽约啦。你在说什么？然后我才反应过来，对啊。在湾区，我们都叫旧金山。没错。老兄，我记得我得自学怎么这么说，因为在韩语里，我爸妈总是说，哦，我们要去旧金山，我猜用英语来说，就是“San Fran”。所以我以为大家都这么说。
[00:36:41.630] then I remember once I saw online or something, it was like real Bay Area people know that you never say San Fran. It's SF or the city. And then I was like, fuck. So I had to train like, oh yeah, I'm going into the city. You know? Yeah. When we did internships, like how we talked about last episode, it'd be like, oh yeah, I'm interning up in the city this summer. Right. Like people would say things like that. Right. I think that's also a pretty unique thing in general, though. Like the
[00:36:41.630] 然后我记得有一次我在网上看到，好像是湾区本地人都知道，他们从来不说“San Fran”，而是说“SF”或者“the city”。当时我就想，卧槽。所以我就得好好训练一下，比如，“哦，对，我要去旧金山了。”你知道吗？是啊。就像我们上一集聊到的，我们做实习的时候，就会说，“哦，对，我今年夏天要在旧金山实习。”对。人们会这么说。对。我觉得这本身也是个挺特别的现象。就像……
[00:37:09.570] fact that we have a bigger city pretty close to us that we can commute to and like take trips to, especially like growing up. I don't know about you, but I would take BART up to SF. And if I did, it was like a big thing, you know, like, wow, like if we're going to go all the way up to SF, like we better be spending a whole last day up there. And so like we would make plans and,
[00:37:09.570] 事实上，我们家附近就有一个大城市，我们可以通勤去那里，也可以去那里旅行，尤其是我小时候。我不知道你们怎么样，但我会坐 BART 去旧金山。如果我真的去了，那感觉就像一件大事，你知道，就像，哇，如果我们要去旧金山，我们最好在那里待上一整天。所以我们会制定计划，
[00:37:34.310] you know, get a bunch of friends. We'd go take the BART early-ish in the morning and then we like BART back after dinner or something like that. Oh my God. I totally have memories like that too. But we were on the other side of the bay. So we took the Caltrain up and I remember it's slightly more annoying with Caltrain because I think BART has way more frequent trains. If I remember like some
[00:37:34.310] 你知道，就是找一群朋友。我们会一大早就坐 BART 去，然后晚饭后再坐 BART 回来之类的。我的天哪。我也有过类似的经历。不过我们当时在海湾的另一边。所以我们坐 Caltrain 去，我记得 Caltrain 稍微麻烦一点，因为 BART 的班次好像多得多。如果我没记错的话，好像……
[00:37:58.690] trains don't stop at every stop and Caltrain has like bullet trains too, but it's not always as common and there's not really any bullet trains on the weekend, if I remember correctly. So basically when we went up to SF, the last like stop on Caltrain is basically a mission bay. So to go into like actual, like, I guess what you would call like the city near Civic Center or like where all the famous
[00:37:58.690] 火车并非每站都停，加州火车也有高铁，但并不常见，而且如果我没记错的话，周末几乎没有高铁。所以基本上，我们去旧金山的时候，加州火车的最后一站是米申湾。要进入真正的市中心，也就是市政中心附近或者所有著名景点所在的区域，就得坐加州火车。
[00:38:22.730] restaurants are and stuff, you still have to like, I don't know, like walk in or like take an Uber or something. And back then Uber wasn't as big of a thing. So I just remember it was like really fucking annoying to get around. One of the days that we went in, it was a weekday, but we just had that day off. So we like did our thing and then we were Caltrain back, but it was at like 5 p.m.
[00:38:22.730] 去餐厅什么的，你还是得，比如说，走进去或者打车什么的。那时候Uber还没那么普及。所以我记得那时候出行真的超级麻烦。有一次我们去餐厅，那天是工作日，但我们正好休息。所以我们就去餐厅玩了一会儿，然后坐Caltrain回来，当时大概是下午5点。
[00:38:46.250] So we took the train back with like all these tired, like tech workers. It was a full train. And I think like some of us had to stand and stuff. And I just remember being like, oh, it's so lame that Caltrain is so quiet and like, we can't even talk because no one talks on the train. Right. Yeah. But now looking back, I'm like, oh God, I hope we did not talk and like cause a scene on the Caltrain. Did you guys ever go up to SF as part of a school trip?
[00:38:46.250] 所以我们就和一群疲惫的科技工作者一起坐火车回去了。车厢里挤满了人。我想我们有些人不得不站着什么的。我当时就记得，哎，加州火车这么安静，真让人郁闷，我们甚至都没法说话，因为车上没人说话。对啊。但现在回想起来，我就想，天哪，我真希望我们当时没说话，免得在加州火车上闹事。你们以前参加过学校组织的旧金山之旅吗？
[00:39:15.870] I think we did for one of our dances, probably like senior prom or something. Okay. And then we did ones for the natural history museum or whatever that one is called. Yeah, I don't know. Oh, is it the exploratorium? Oh shit. It might be, it also might be the California Academy of Science. Oh, okay. We don't know our museums.
[00:39:15.870] 我想我们好像为某个舞会拍过，可能是毕业舞会之类的。好吧。然后我们还为自然历史博物馆拍过，或者叫什么来着。嗯，我不知道。哦，是探索馆吗？糟糕。可能是，也可能是加州科学院。哦，好吧。我们对博物馆不太了解。
[00:39:42.060] Yeah, I think I went up to SF maybe once or twice for like an actual school trip, which was now that I'm thinking back on it, I think we actually like met up at BART and we all like got into groups, assigned groups, and we BARTed up together and like we BARTed back down together. Kind of crazy, right? Like just thinking about parents letting their children loose and like going up on this train to the city with friends.
[00:39:42.060] 是啊，我好像去过旧金山一两次，算是学校组织的旅行吧。现在想想，我们好像是在BART（旧金山湾区捷运）集合，然后大家分成小组，一起坐BART上去，再一起坐BART下来。想想就觉得挺疯狂的，对吧？想想就觉得不可思议，家长们居然放任孩子自由自在地和朋友们一起坐火车去旧金山。
[00:40:11.180] At least with school, it's like, okay, well, there's going to be chaperones. But like sometimes we would just go like with friends, right? On the weekend or something. And like, how did our parents let us do that? We probably felt like, oh yeah, I'm old enough. Like I can do this now. Considering we were living in the suburb, I feel like that's a lot different. Like what parents are exposed to and like what kids are exposed to versus say like someone who grew up in like Chicago or
[00:40:11.180] 至少在学校里，我们会想，好吧，会有监护人陪同。但有时候我们也会和朋友一起出去玩，对吧？比如周末什么的。那时候，我们的父母怎么会允许我们这么做呢？我们可能觉得，哦，是啊，我已经够大了。我现在可以做这些事了。考虑到我们住在郊区，我觉得这很不一样。父母和孩子接触到的东西，跟在芝加哥长大的人相比，差别很大。
[00:40:36.520] like New York, like in the city. But here it's just like, oh, okay, I guess I'll just let my child run free and go up to the city and I won't be there. Yeah, no, I think when you grow up in the suburbs, you definitely have a little bit less like street smarts. But like how often were you guys going into the city? Because I feel like for us, it was like under, at least for me, I don't think I went up there more than like five times. And every single
[00:40:36.520] 就像纽约，就像在城里一样。但在这里，感觉就像，哦，好吧，我想我就让孩子自由自在地跑去城里玩，我不在。是啊，我觉得在郊区长大的人，肯定少一些街头智慧。但是你们多久去一次城里呢？因为我觉得对我们来说，次数很少，至少对我来说，我估计去城里的次数不超过五次。而且每次
[00:41:05.800] time I would like have to hype myself up because I'm a suburbs girly, you know, I'm like, yeah, the city's so dangerous. Like gotta be careful tomorrow. I think similar, probably less than five times, at least in high school, probably in college started getting more common just because, you know, maybe more people had more experience with SF since they might have interned there or just like, we're older now. So we'd like drive up or whatever.
[00:41:05.800] 有时候我得给自己打气，因为我是个郊区女孩，你知道，我会说，是啊，城市太危险了。比如明天要小心点。我觉得类似的情况，大概不到五次，至少在高中是这样，可能大学的时候开始变得比较常见，因为，你知道，也许更多的人对旧金山有了更多了解，比如他们可能在那里实习过，或者只是因为我们年纪大了。所以我们会开车去看看什么的。
[00:41:33.780] Yeah, honestly, it wasn't that much. It was definitely like a big event if we were going to go up to the city, spend like a day there. I just remember anytime I went up to the city, my mom would be like absolutely fucking distraught, so worried. She's like, SF is going to be freezing, like wear a parka. I'm like, mom, it's like summer. And you know, it's like when you go into SF, I feel like you have to take pictures, at least in high school, because it's like cool to have gone up.
[00:41:33.780] 是啊，说实话，也没那么夸张。但如果我们要去旧金山，在那儿待上一天，那绝对算得上是件大事。我记得每次我去旧金山，我妈都会特别焦虑，特别担心。她会说，旧金山肯定冷死了，得穿件羽绒服。我就说，妈，现在可是夏天啊。你知道，我觉得去旧金山就得拍照留念，至少在高中的时候是这样，因为去过旧金山感觉很酷。
[00:42:02.200] So I would always try to wear like my cutest fits. And I can't be fucking cute when I'm wearing like a parka, right? So I just remember like going back and forth with my mom and eventually like bringing one but like leaving it on the ground or something for a fuck. Dude, now that I think about it, my mom was probably similar because my mom's a bit more like of a warrior. But then like when I interned in SF, I think like they didn't give a fuck. Like my parents
[00:42:02.200] 所以我总是尽量穿我最好看的衣服。可是穿着羽绒服怎么可能好看呢？对吧？所以我记得我跟我妈来回纠结，最后还是买了一件，但总是随手扔在地上什么的。哥们儿，现在想想，我妈可能也差不多，因为她更像个女战士。不过后来我在旧金山实习的时候，我觉得他们好像根本不在乎。就像我爸妈那样。
[00:42:32.200] work and have fun, peace out. I'm like, what happened to all of that worry just like a couple years ago? I guess you would have been mostly indoors versus just like outside. I guess that's fair. I'm like not running around as much. But sometimes I would stay in the city for like dinner with friends who are also interning or with like co-workers sometimes. Huh. They're like,
[00:42:32.200] 工作之余也要享受生活，就此告别。我就想，几年前的那些焦虑都去哪儿了？我猜那时候你大部分时间都待在室内，而不是到处跑。我觉得这很合理。我的确不像以前那样到处奔波了。但有时候我会留在城里，和同样在实习的朋友或者同事一起吃顿饭。嗯。他们会说，
[00:42:56.580] you're making your own money. Bye. Off the roster of things I need to worry about. They're like, oh, you're still here? Well, this is so funny kind of looking back. I do think that it still rings true that the Bay Area has changed a decent amount. But now that we're really talking about our childhood experiences, especially with San Francisco, I feel like we're the ones who changed and we're the ones who kind of
[00:42:56.580] 你在自己赚钱。拜拜。这又从我需要担心的事情清单上划掉了。他们会说，哦，你还在啊？嗯，回想起来真是挺有意思的。我确实觉得湾区变化很大，这句话现在依然适用。但现在我们真的在谈论我们的童年经历，尤其是关于旧金山的经历，我觉得改变的是我们自己，是我们自己……
[00:43:25.480] have maybe a slightly, hopefully slightly bigger worldview to be able to notice different things. So thank you for taking a trip down memory lane with me, Crystal.

We would love to see if you also had similar perspectives on
