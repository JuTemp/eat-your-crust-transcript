[00:00:01.170] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. So before we jump into our topic today, I actually have a funny story to share. So the other day, James and I were walking to get Gatorade and like soda from this liquor store that's really close by. It's literally like a five minute walk.
[00:00:01.170] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。在我们正式开始今天的话题之前，我先要分享一个有趣的故事。前几天，我和James去附近的一家酒铺买佳得乐和汽水，步行大概五分钟就到了。
[00:00:29.870] And to get to this liquor store, you basically have to pass by this like little plaza. And there's a really cute like small kind of hole in the wall donut shop there in that plaza. And it's owned by an Asian family. So in the past, when we went by, the like parents were kind of running the store. And they chatted me and James up and they were like, oh my god, what ethnicity are you guys? And James was like, I'm Chinese. And then they were like, oh my god, we're Chinese. Oh my god. Do you speak Chinese?
[00:00:29.870] 要到这家酒铺，你基本上得经过一个小广场。广场里有一家很可爱的小甜甜圈店，店面很小，有点像街边小店。店主是一家亚裔家庭。之前我们路过的时候，店主夫妇正在店里忙活。他们跟我还有詹姆斯聊了起来，然后问：“天哪，你们是哪族裔的？”詹姆斯说：“我是中国人。”他们又说：“天哪，我们是中国人！天哪！你们会说中文吗？”
[00:00:58.370] My stupid sons don't speak Chinese. And me and James were like, oh my god. And James was like, yeah, I speak a little bit of Chinese. And they were like, oh my god, you're like the most wonderful son ever. And they were just like super sweet and really nice. So it's like a donut shop that we look upon fondly. On the way back from the liquor store, me and James were like, let's just like pop in. You know, like the door was open. So we'll just like swing our head in. And James was like, hi, are you guys open? I think the son presumably was like working that day.
[00:00:58.370] 我那两个笨儿子不会说中文。我和詹姆斯当时就惊呆了，心想：我的天哪！詹姆斯说：是啊，我会说一点中文。他们说：我的天哪，你简直是世界上最棒的儿子！他们人特别好，特别热情。所以，那家甜甜圈店让我们印象特别深刻。那天从酒铺回来的路上，我和詹姆斯就想：不如进去看看吧。你知道，店门开着呢。我们就探头进去看了看。詹姆斯问：嗨，你们开门吗？我猜那天店主儿子应该是在上班。
[00:01:27.670] He was like, yeah, just come on in. I was like, oh, can I get some donut holes, buttermilk bar or something? And James was like, I'll have a glazed donut. Yeah. And then the guy packs all of the rest of the donut holes into our box. It must have been like 25 or something like that. Oh my god. I was like, holy fuck. And then he was like, oh yeah, don't worry about it. It's like later in the day anyway. Wow. And then he was like, you guys don't live around here, huh? It's just funny because it's literally across the street from us, right? Yeah. So we were like, oh no, we like live over here just across the street down there. And he was like, oh, no way.
[00:01:27.670] 他当时就说，行，进来吧。我说，哦，我能要点甜甜圈小球、酪乳甜甜圈之类的吗？詹姆斯说，我要一个糖霜甜甜圈。好的。然后那家伙把剩下的甜甜圈小球全都塞进了我们的盒子里。大概有25个左右吧。我的天哪。我当时就想，卧槽。然后他说，哦，没事儿。反正也快到晚上了。哇。然后他又说，你们不住在这附近吧？真巧，这店就在我们家对面，对吧？是啊。所以我们就说，哦不，我们就住在街对面。他说，哦，不会吧。
[00:01:56.890] Did you guys just buy that house? And then he pointed out the house that wasn't our house, but was just on sale. We were like, no, but just like maybe like a block away. And he was like, oh, that's crazy because I just assumed you guys weren't from here since there's no Asians in this area. He was like, I grew up here, so I'm like really used to not seeing Asians. So it's like crazy that you guys live here. Yeah. And it was all like super friendly and stuff. And we were just like, oh, it must have been a little bit tough for him being in the Bay that's very Asian, but in a city that's not Asian at all. Right.
[00:01:56.890] 你们刚买了那栋房子吗？然后他指着那栋房子，那不是我们的房子，但正好在出售。我们说，没有，大概就在一个街区外。他说，哦，真不可思议，因为这附近没有亚洲人，我一直以为你们不是本地人。他说，我在这儿长大，所以很习惯看不到亚洲人。所以你们住在这里真是太不可思议了。是啊。他们都非常友好。我们就想，哦，对他来说，住在亚洲人很多的湾区，却住在一个完全没有亚洲人的城市，肯定有点难受吧。对。
[00:02:26.410] But yeah, he was like super nice. And then we walked back home. I was just thinking about the irony of it a little bit. James and I both came from very, very Asian cities. Yeah. And then now we're like getting head nods from other Asian people on the street, feeling this kind of sense of connection with other Asians in like a less Asian city. And I was kind of thinking like, I'll never understand what it's like to be an Asian growing up in like a city in the Midwest or somewhere that's like very white.
[00:02:26.410] 是啊，他真的超级好。然后我们就一起走回家了。我当时就在想，这事儿挺讽刺的。我和詹姆斯都来自非常非常亚裔的城市。是啊。然后现在，我们在街上走着，其他亚裔会点头示意，在一个亚裔人口相对较少的城市里，我们却能感受到这种与其他亚裔的联系。我就在想，我永远也无法理解在像中西部或者其他白人占多数的城市长大的亚裔是什么感觉。
[00:02:53.510] But I'm getting like a tiny glimpse of it here in my adulthood. Yeah, that's very interesting. And I haven't spent a ton of time in the city that you live in in the Bay. But just from my knowledge and observation so far, I feel like there have been more people kind of starting to move into this particular city. Right. So I wonder if over time it might start to get more diverse. Yeah, I think so. I guess it's kind of funny because it's not like there's like no Asians here at all.
[00:02:53.510] 但我成年后才稍微感受到这一点。是啊，很有意思。我还没怎么去过你住的那个湾区城市。但就我目前的了解和观察来看，感觉好像有更多人开始搬到那个城市了。没错。所以我在想，随着时间的推移，它会不会变得更加多元化。嗯，我觉得会。我觉得挺有意思的，因为这里也不是完全没有亚裔。
[00:03:22.290] But I'm sure just the experience is so much more different for someone who has seen the history of this city. So I totally agree with you. I feel like my experience hasn't been like, oh, there's no Asians here. But it's definitely been like a transition from the past cities that James and I have lived in. But yeah, pretty cool to kind of get recognition from other Asians here. I feel like we had a little special moment in the donut shop. And now I'm like, should I go back? Yeah. Just to say hi?
[00:03:22.290] 但我相信，对于了解这座城市历史的人来说，体验肯定截然不同。所以我完全同意你的看法。我的感觉并不是“哦，这里没有亚洲人”。但这里确实和我和詹姆斯之前居住的城市有所不同。不过，能得到其他亚洲人的认可，感觉很棒。我觉得我们在甜甜圈店里经历了一段特别的时刻。现在我在想，要不要再去一次？嗯，就为了打个招呼？
[00:03:48.950] Or like, should I be buying more donuts from them just because they're so nice? You know, maybe you can get like coffee from them. Oh, that's true. I thought the son was going to be like, oh, my God, you two are the fuckers who like, my parents said can speak Chinese at home. Dude, I'm like, the goal is to meet their entire family. Like, where's the other son? Any sisters? I also have a bit of a funny story this week.
[00:03:48.950] 或者，我是不是应该因为他们人好就多买点甜甜圈？你知道，说不定还能从他们那儿买到咖啡呢。哦，对啊。我当时还以为他们儿子会说：“我的天哪，你们俩就是我爸妈说的在家会说中文的那两个家伙。” 哥们儿，我就想，我的目标是见见他们全家啊。比如说，另一个儿子呢？有姐妹吗？这周我还有个挺好笑的事儿。
[00:04:13.550] I feel like my funny stories are usually me scrambling to like, I don't know, survive, I guess. So this week, my debacle was I recently in the past like couple months or so started up therapy again since moving back. My current therapist I see in person, but they're a little far. They're like on the other side of the bay from me. So it's closer to work.
[00:04:13.550] 我觉得我那些搞笑的故事通常都是我在努力挣扎求生，大概就是那种……嗯，挣扎求生吧。所以这周，我的窘境是，我最近几个月搬回来后又开始接受心理治疗了。我现在的治疗师是面诊，但是有点远，在海湾的另一边。所以去诊所离我上班的地方比较近。
[00:04:40.330] What I usually do is I schedule it on a weekday so that I can like go to it during the lunch hour or like leave work maybe an hour early to like go to my appointment before going home. Right. And so I had it scheduled on Tuesday last week. Everything was planned out in my head as planned out as it could be. Basically, wake up, go to work, go to therapy. But then I was at work.
[00:04:40.330] 我通常会把咨询安排在工作日，这样我就可以在午休时间去，或者提前一个小时下班，在回家前先去咨询。对。所以上周二我就安排好了。我脑子里把一切都计划得尽可能周全。基本上就是：起床，上班，去咨询。但后来我去了公司。
[00:05:07.670] I had a meeting really close to my therapy time and it takes about 30 minutes to get from work to therapy. So I was like, OK, I'll take this particular meeting on the car because I don't really have to talk. It's more of a listening meeting. I have it all planned out. I like left, grabbed lunch and was about to head out when I got a text from my therapist that was like, oh, I'm so sorry for the late notice. But can we actually meet online today? And I was like, oh, yeah, sure.
[00:05:07.670] 我有个会议，时间离我的治疗时间很近，从公司到治疗室大概要半小时。所以我就想，好吧，就开车去吧，因为我不用说话，主要是倾听。我已经计划好了。我离开公司，吃了午饭，正准备出门的时候，收到了治疗师的短信，她说：“哦，真抱歉这么晚才通知你。我们今天可以线上见面吗？” 我回复说：“哦，好的，没问题。”
[00:05:35.730] And I was like, fuck, now I guess I have to go back to office to like take that meeting and then find a meeting room to take therapy in. Right. So I got back to my office and I was like maybe five minutes late to my meeting. There was about 15 minutes left between that meeting and my therapy starting time. So I was like wandering around desperately looking for a room. So we have these phone booth kind of things in our office and they're really nice because they're actually quite soundproof.
[00:05:35.730] 我当时就想，完了，看来我得回办公室开会，然后再找个会议室去做心理咨询了。好吧。于是我回到办公室，开会的时候大概迟到了五分钟。会议结束到心理咨询开始还有大约十五分钟。所以我就开始到处乱转，拼命地找房间。我们办公室里有那种电话亭，隔音效果很好，挺不错的。
[00:06:04.310] Because, you know, sometimes meeting rooms are like big and stuff, but they're not super soundproof. That's true. Yeah. So these phone booths are like pretty small and compact and they're pretty soundproof. So I found an empty one, got in there and then I started my therapy meeting in there. But I was just like, oh, my God, like my whole day got derailed. Your three things on your agenda. I guess I still went to work and I still had therapy and I still woke up. But like, you know.
[00:06:04.310] 你知道，有时候会议室很大，但是隔音效果不太好。确实如此。是啊。所以这些电话亭很小巧紧凑，而且隔音效果很好。我就找到一个空的，进去之后就开始了我的心理咨询。但我当时就想，我的天哪，感觉我一整天的计划都被打乱了。你日程上的三件事全都泡汤了。我想我还是去上班了，还是做了心理咨询，还是起床了。但是，你知道的。
[00:06:33.590] That must be like a crazy experience to take your therapy meeting or not your therapy meeting, your therapy appointment at work. Did it feel weird? It was a little weird. OK, so I was like, thank God this phone booth is like pretty soundproof because what if someone outside is just hearing me talk about like random shit? And they're like, that doesn't sound work related. Imagine me talking about like life struggles or just like random, really personal things.
[00:06:33.590] 在工作场所进行心理咨询（或者说，不是心理咨询，而是心理咨询预约）肯定是一次很奇特的经历吧？感觉怪怪的吗？确实有点怪。当时我就想，谢天谢地，这个电话亭隔音效果还不错，万一外面有人听到我胡扯怎么办？他们肯定会说，这听起来跟工作没关系。想象一下，我跟他们聊生活琐事或者一些非常私人的事情。
[00:07:02.130] And someone's just walking by and like, wait, what? They're like, interesting. Is that a new code word for one of our secret projects? I don't know if you're like the super emotional type during therapy, but I know a lot of people like cry during their sessions. So you're just like sobbing in the meeting room. People are like, what the fuck? Oh, my God. OK, luckily, no crying in my therapy. We talked a lot about like emotional management. So I'm sure if like someone could hear, though, they would probably be like, oh, like this sounds helpful.
[00:07:02.130] 然后有人路过，心想，等等，什么？他们说，有意思。这是我们某个秘密项目的新暗号吗？我不知道你是不是那种在治疗过程中特别容易情绪激动的人，但我知道很多人在治疗过程中会哭。所以你就在会议室里嚎啕大哭。别人会想，这他妈什么情况？我的天哪。好吧，还好，我的治疗过程中没哭。我们聊了很多关于情绪管理的内容。所以我觉得，如果有人听到的话，他们可能会觉得，哦，这听起来挺有帮助的。
[00:07:31.290] But like, what does it have to do with work? I'm like surprised you didn't take the meeting in your car. OK, so I really thought about it. Yeah. But the thing about the car is that I feel like it would be too obvious. She would probably be like, why the fuck are you taking this appointment in your car? So when you do therapy online, I think one of the most common platform they do it on is called telehealth. I've used that before.
[00:07:31.290] 但是，这跟工作有什么关系呢？我挺惊讶你没在车里开会。好吧，我确实考虑过了。是啊。但我觉得在车里开会太明显了。她可能会问，你他妈的为什么要在车里赴约？对了，网上咨询，我觉得最常用的平台之一叫远程医疗。我以前用过。
[00:07:59.570] I'm pretty sure you can't change your background. Oh, I think it would be too obvious. Like she would see this fucking seats and be like, why is there a window back there? People like walking around. Yeah. Empty backseat behind me. That's true. Although she definitely can't fault you because, you know, last minute thing. So yeah, it'll derail. I guess like I could have maybe driven home instead of driving to therapy and taking that one work meeting on the car.
[00:07:59.570] 我敢肯定你不能换背景。哦，我觉得那样太明显了。她看到这该死的座椅，肯定会想，后面怎么有个窗户？大家都喜欢走来走去。是啊，我身后的后座是空的。没错。不过她肯定不能怪你，毕竟是临时决定的。所以，嗯，事情肯定会出岔子。我想我本来可以开车回家，而不是开车去接受心理治疗，还要开车去参加那个工作会议。
[00:08:27.990] I could have taken that one work meeting on the car and driven home. I don't know. I actually didn't think about that until now. You're like, why did I not do that? It might have been cutting it very close. Oh, that's true. Damn. That sounds challenging. Therapy appointment at work. Yeah, it was not the most ideal. But it worked out. It was fine. That's good. Well, I guess our personal stories aside, let's kind of dive into our topic this week, which is also a little bit personal.
[00:08:27.990] 我本来可以开车去参加那个工作会议，然后直接回家。我不知道。其实直到现在我才想到这一点。你会问，我为什么没那么做？可能时间真的有点紧。哦，确实如此。哎。听起来挺有挑战性的。在公司参加心理咨询。是啊，这确实不是最理想的安排。但最终还是解决了。一切都还好。那就好。好了，我想先把我们各自的经历抛到一边，让我们进入本周的话题，这个话题也跟我个人有点关系。
[00:08:56.790] We wanted to take this episode to talk about our parents and in general, our relationship with them, how it has evolved, maybe communication styles and preferences with them, etc., etc. Let me first ask you, Crystal. Okay. When you were growing up, did you have phases where you liked one parent more than the other? Whoa. I think I've always kind of leaned towards my mom.
[00:08:56.790] 我们想借这期节目聊聊我们的父母，以及我们和他们的关系，这种关系是如何演变的，还有我们和他们的沟通方式和偏好等等。首先我想问你，克丽丝塔尔。好的。在你成长的过程中，有没有哪个阶段你更喜欢父母中的一方？哇哦。我想我一直都比较偏向我妈妈。
[00:09:25.010] Not saying I don't like my dad. You know? But I think there's like a girl bond there, you know? A womanly bond. That's true. There's some things that you go through life as a woman, as a girl, going through puberty and stuff like that. It's just easier to talk to your mom about these things if you're also a girl. Imagine how awkward it would be if your dad walked you through period stuff. Yeah.
[00:09:25.010] 我不是说我不喜欢我爸。你知道吗？但我觉得我们之间有一种女孩子之间的默契，你知道吗？一种女性之间的默契。确实如此。作为女人，作为女孩，你会经历一些人生大事，比如青春期之类的。如果你也是个女孩，跟妈妈谈论这些事情就容易多了。想想看，如果爸爸来教你如何应对月经，那该有多尴尬啊。是啊。
[00:09:53.970] An Asian dad at that, too. That would be a nightmare for sure. He'd probably like fling a pad at you and be like, um, you just like use this. I'm not super sure how, but like peace out. Yeah. Yeah, that would definitely be awkward. And I know what you mean about the girl bond. I think there's just naturally more things that you have in common with your mom. And at least for my family, my dad was the breadwinner and my mom was a housewife.
[00:09:53.970] 而且还是个亚裔爸爸。那肯定很尴尬。他可能会把卫生巾扔给你，然后说，呃，你就用这个吧。我不太确定他会怎么做，反正就是“拜拜”。是啊，那肯定会很尴尬。我知道你说的姐妹情谊是什么意思。我觉得你和妈妈之间自然而然会有更多的共同点。至少在我家，我爸爸是养家糊口的人，我妈妈是家庭主妇。
[00:10:19.090] Anything like car rides home, getting dropped off at school in the morning, those were all done by my mom. And I feel like those small moments in the day-to-day are like sometimes when you build a closer bond with someone rather than like the big things. So I totally feel that. But for me, I think it was kind of different because I think when I was younger, I was closer to my dad. And I think part of the reason is my dad is a really good storyteller.
[00:10:19.090] 像开车送我回家、早上送我去学校这些事，都是我妈妈做的。我觉得，有时候，比起那些大事，日常生活中这些小事反而更能拉近人与人之间的距离。所以我完全理解这种感觉。但对我来说，情况有点不一样，因为我小时候和爸爸更亲近。我觉得部分原因是我爸爸很会讲故事。
[00:10:46.730] So he used to tell me stories about what I now know are like movies or like Greek myths. I'm like, wait, he literally just told me the plot to this movie. Oh, my God. But it was like so fascinating for me as a kid. So then Sunday mornings, he would always tell me stories and then we would just talk about things. So those are like some really fond memories I have with him. That's nice. Oh, I bond with my dad. It's kind of funny, but we'll do like was like handyman kind of stuff. Like home maintenance stuff.
[00:10:46.730] 所以他以前经常给我讲故事，我现在才知道那些故事跟电影情节或者希腊神话有关。我当时就想，等等，他居然把电影剧情都跟我讲了！我的天哪！但小时候我觉得特别有意思。所以每个星期天早上，他都会给我讲故事，然后我们就会聊天。这些都是我和他之间非常美好的回忆。真好。我和我爸关系很亲密。说起来有点好笑，我们会一起做些零零碎碎的家务活，比如房屋维护之类的。
[00:11:16.090] So I guess like one example is two or three years ago, I cleaned out my closet and I like installed a new shelving system in it. Right. I like did most of the cleaning. I took the doors out and then I bought the like shelving unit. I know I could have done it myself, but I also feel like my dad gains like a sense of pride, maybe of like helping or like doing this. Like, oh, I'm like the man of the house or whatever.
[00:11:16.090] 举个例子，两三年前，我清理了我的衣橱，还在里面装了一套新的置物架。没错，大部分的清理工作都是我做的。我把衣橱门卸了下来，然后买了置物架。我知道我自己也能做，但我感觉我爸会因此获得一种自豪感，好像在说“哦，我是一家之主”之类的。
[00:11:45.190] So I was like, oh, dad, I'm going to install this thing. Do you want to help? And he was like, yeah, like let me get my tools. Like I'll come help. And then we like put it together and, you know, did all that. You know, I kind of get what you mean by like I did it so that my dad would feel like involved in like a sense of fulfillment and stuff. Because I feel like a recent learning for me was like there's lots of things that I lean on my mom for for help. And it just comes naturally. Like I'm always like, oh, how do you make this recipe? What do you have to buy at the grocery store? You know, things like that.
[00:11:45.190] 所以我就说，爸，我要装这个东西了，你想帮忙吗？他说，好啊，我去拿工具，我这就来帮忙。然后我们就一起把它装好了，你知道的，就是那些事儿。你知道，我有点明白你说的，我这么做是为了让爸爸觉得参与其中，让他有成就感之类的。因为我最近才意识到，我有很多事情都依赖我妈帮忙。这都是自然而然的。比如我总是问，哦，这个菜怎么做？去超市要买什么？你知道，就是诸如此类的问题。
[00:12:14.170] But then I don't naturally have questions like that to ask my dad. Right. So then I recently started getting back into golf and I was like, oh, should I buy this golf bag and like this cart and stuff like that. So I like messaged my dad. And I feel like he was probably shocked because like I've talked about in this podcast before, I don't, you know, one on one talk to my dad a ton. It's like always through my mom or like with my mom or something.
[00:12:14.170] 但我平时不会问我爸这类问题。对吧。最近我又开始打高尔夫了，就想，哎，要不要买个球包，再买个球车什么的。于是我就给我爸发了条信息。我觉得他可能挺惊讶的，因为就像我之前在这个播客里说的，我平时很少跟我爸单独聊天。我们之间总是通过我妈或者跟我妈沟通什么的。
[00:12:42.710] So then we just like talked about it back and forth in our group chat, maybe like 10 minutes or something like that. Afterwards, I was like, why don't I do this more often? Like it's something so easy. Right. But I just never thought about it too deeply, I guess. What about did your dad ever pick you up from, I don't know, like the airport or after school? Were those ever like one on one moments? Yeah, there were definitely some moments like that. But so my dad used to go on a ton of business trips and he still does.
[00:12:42.710] 所以我们就在群聊里来回聊了大概十分钟吧。之后我就想，我为什么不经常这么做呢？这明明很简单。是啊。但我之前好像从来没认真想过。你爸爸有没有来接过你，比如去机场或者放学？有没有那种单独相处的时光？嗯，确实有一些。但我爸爸以前经常出差，现在也一样。
[00:13:11.930] So there were like long periods of time where he was maybe not home or like he was abroad and things like that. So then I think the moments just became fewer and fewer over the years. I don't know. I feel like low key. I was like not a very good daughter in high school. Actually, I shouldn't say low key because I know I wasn't. Just with all the hormones, going through puberty and the stress of college applications and whatnot. So there was a time period where my relationship with my dad was like kind of rocky.
[00:13:11.930] 所以，他经常有很长一段时间不在家，或者出国之类的。然后我觉得，随着时间推移，我们相处的时间越来越少。我也不知道。我感觉自己有点儿……嗯，高中时我不是个好女儿。其实，我不应该说自己“不太好”，因为我知道我当时确实不是。那时候荷尔蒙分泌旺盛，正经历青春期，还要承受申请大学的压力等等。所以有一段时间，我和爸爸的关系有点儿紧张。
[00:13:40.730] So then when we did have those moments of like being in the car just one on one, we were very prone to like fighting. So I think for a couple of years I was like, OK, I don't want to fight with my dad. Yeah. So I'm not going to try to extend myself out too much to him. Oh, I see. Oh, my God. I think I can totally relate because one time I was having lunch with me. It was me, my brother and my dad.
[00:13:40.730] 所以，当我们偶尔单独待在车里的时候，我们很容易吵架。所以我想，有那么几年，我一直想着，好吧，我不想和爸爸吵架。是啊。所以我不会主动和他走得太近。哦，我明白了。我的天哪。我完全能理解，因为有一次我和我爸、我弟弟一起吃午饭。
[00:14:05.630] But somehow like our childhood kind of got brought up and my dad was like, Crystal, you were a great baby, like very easy to take care of. Very tame. Didn't cry too much. Like we just had to give you food. And then he was like, but then the moment you became a teenager, we were like, what the fuck happened to our daughter? Why is she the devil? Jesus Christ. That's a big jump. But I thought that was hella funny.
[00:14:05.630] 但不知怎么的，我们俩的童年回忆就这么翻了出来，我爸说：“克丽丝塔尔，你小时候真是个乖宝宝，特别好带，特别温顺，也不怎么哭闹，我们只要喂你吃饭就行了。” 然后他又说：“可是你一到青春期，我们就都懵了，我们女儿到底怎么了？她怎么变成魔鬼了？我的天哪。” 这转变也太快了吧。不过我觉得这事儿特别搞笑。
[00:14:34.370] I was like, oh, my God. Yeah, it's probably totally a brat. You know, that reminds me of I think for a long time I had this idea of me being like a perfect kid when I was young because I feel like I remember me following all the rules. And then, of course, before memories, when you're like an infant, there's no recollection of anything. But yeah, my mom was like, no, actually, you cried all the time. Once you threw a fit at a grocery store, temper tantrums, you name it.
[00:14:34.370] 我当时就想，我的天哪。是啊，他肯定是个十足的熊孩子。你知道吗，这让我想起，我曾经一直觉得自己小时候是个完美孩子，因为我记得自己一直都很守规矩。当然，在记忆形成之前，就像婴儿时期一样，什么都记不起来。但是，我妈却说，不，其实你总是哭。有一次你在超市里大哭大闹，各种耍脾气，你能想到的你都经历过。
[00:15:02.390] And I was like, I don't remember these things. Like I feel like my brain just blocked it out. And in my memories, I'm like an angelic kid. Wow, I should ask my parents. I'll be like, when was my most difficult time? How was I as a baby? I think one of the other things, too, that is always a little bit of a factor or maybe like a milestone in our relationship with our parents, especially at a young age, is the moment you realize they're not perfect.
[00:15:02.390] 我当时就想，我不记得这些事了。感觉就像我的大脑把它们都屏蔽掉了。在我的记忆里，我简直是个天使般的孩子。哇，我应该问问我爸妈。我会问，我小时候最难熬的时候是什么时候？我小时候是什么样的？我觉得还有一点，也是我们和父母关系中一个重要的因素，或者说是一个里程碑，尤其是在年幼的时候，那就是你意识到他们并不完美的那一刻。
[00:15:31.490] And then the judgment that kind of follows that. I feel like it's been like an up and down journey for me personally, because when I was younger, my parents were the shit. They were my everything. Yeah. And I'm sure a lot of children feel that way, too. Right. Their opinion was my opinion. When kids at school had a different opinion, I was like, you're wrong because my mom and dad said this and they're smarter than your mom and dad. I see. I see.
[00:15:31.490] 然后就是随之而来的评判。我觉得对我个人而言，这就像一段起起伏伏的旅程，因为小时候，我爸妈简直太棒了。他们就是我的一切。是啊。我相信很多孩子也有这种感觉。没错。他们的观点就是我的观点。当学校里的孩子有不同的意见时，我就会说，你们错了，因为我爸妈是这么说的，他们比你们爸妈聪明。我明白了。我明白了。
[00:15:56.110] But then kind of in that puberty era, you realize that there are things that you and your parents disagree on or like you might not agree with the way your parents approach things. And then that to me was a really hard time. I think it was really difficult for me to reconcile my image of my parents and like the actual parents themselves.
[00:15:56.110] 但到了青春期，你会意识到你和父母在某些事情上存在分歧，或者你不认同他们处理事情的方式。对我来说，那段时间真的很难熬。我觉得我很难调和自己对父母的印象和他们真实的一面。
[00:16:17.210] And then that gap or that discrepancy between my expectations and my idea of them and who I was realizing they were as people was causing me to like just dislike them for a little bit. When was this happening? I think this was like in middle school when my dad was like, you have to get straight A's. And I was like, you're wrong.
[00:16:17.210] 然后，我对他们的期望和我对他们的认知，以及我逐渐认识到的他们的真实面貌之间的差距，让我有一段时间有点讨厌他们。这是什么时候发生的呢？我想大概是在初中，当时我爸说，你必须门门功课都拿A。而我当时就想，你错了。
[00:16:41.130] I thought you were going to be like, this is like right now, like we have disagreements on like things like how the world should be run. But no, you're like middle school because they wanted me to have good grades. Middle school because they were strict. I mean, I think at my current age, I know my parents a little bit better. And I think it's way harder to pass judgment on them than it was for me when I was in middle school.
[00:16:41.130] 我以为你会说，这就像现在这样，我们会在一些事情上产生分歧，比如世界应该如何运转。但你却说，就像中学时期，因为他们希望我成绩好。中学时期，因为他们很严格。我的意思是，我觉得我现在这个年纪，对父母的了解更深入了。而且我觉得，比起中学时期，现在要评判他们要难得多。
[00:17:09.690] Because in middle school, I'm a kid and I'm like, you're an adult and you can't even do this or like you still think this or whatever. But then now I'm also an adult. So to me, now I'm more like impressed by them. I'm like, I can't believe you guys can take care of your garden. I can't believe how clean your house is. The things. Yes, yes, I see. I can totally see that, though.
[00:17:09.690] 因为在中学的时候，我还是个孩子，我会想，你们都大人了，居然连这些都做不到，或者你们还这么想什么的。但现在我也长大了。所以现在我更佩服他们。我会想，你们居然能把花园打理得这么好，房子也这么干净，真是难以置信。是啊，是啊，我明白了。我完全能理解。
[00:17:36.370] I definitely also disagreed with my parents for being strict in junior high and high school. They wanted me to take like all the hard classes. And I was like, no, I'm dumb. Like, no, I can't take all of these ones. Only some of them. They're like, no, I think you can do it. I'm like, no, I really can't. You're like, please believe me. Nowadays, it's like, well, I guess we're all adults.
[00:17:36.370] 我肯定也不赞同父母在初中和高中对我的严格要求。他们想让我选修所有难的课。我就想，不行，我太笨了。不行，我不可能全部都选。只能选一部分。他们说，不，我觉得你能行。我说，不行，我真的不行。他们就说，请相信我。现在想想，好吧，我想我们都长大了。
[00:18:05.410] So I sometimes think about the things that they did at our age. My parents got married at I think it was 28 or so. And then they immediately moved out of China to a whole new country. Right. So I was like, oh, my God, would I do that next year? Not really. No, I totally agree.
[00:18:05.410] 所以我有时会想，他们在我们这个年纪都做了些什么。我父母结婚的时候，大概28岁左右吧。然后他们就立刻离开中国，搬到了一个全新的国家。没错。所以我就想，天哪，我明年也会这么做吗？不太可能。不，我完全同意。
[00:18:24.270] And I wonder if part of the whole parents being really strict when you're young, kind of loosening up, you know, the older you get and things like that are like the parents version of, you know, like they're coming to terms with who we are as we're coming to terms with who they are. My dad had all these dreams for me and I was like, I can't fulfill these things for you. And at the same time, I'm having realizations about my parents and seeing them more as actual people and not just like idols or like imaginary figures.
[00:18:24.270] 我一直在想，父母在你小时候管教很严，随着年龄增长逐渐放松，是不是就像父母也在慢慢接受我们，就像我们也在慢慢接受他们一样。我爸爸对我寄予厚望，但我却觉得，我无法替你实现这些愿望。与此同时，我也开始对父母有了新的认识，把他们看作是活生生的人，而不是偶像或虚构的人物。
[00:18:53.130] Right. That kind of reminds me, too, of like tax season kind of just recently passed a couple months ago. And I was doing my taxes and I was like, holy fuck, I had to pay so many taxes also because I had to do New York and California for this past tax year. And my parents just like laughed in my face and they're like, yeah, welcome to the real world. And I was like, oh, my God, I'm so poor now. And they were like, yeah, same.
[00:18:53.130] 对。这让我想起几个月前刚过去的报税季。我当时在报税，心想，我的天哪，我得交这么多税，因为上个纳税年度我还要报纽约州和加州的税。我爸妈就嘲笑我，说，是啊，欢迎来到现实世界。我说，哦，我的天哪，我现在穷死了。他们说，是啊，我也是。
[00:19:24.430] Dude, but you also bring up such a good point of like finances. My parents had me when they were my dad was 34 and my mom was about 30 or so. That's not that far off from our age. Like there's definitely a couple of years left to go. But 30 is kind of creeping up on us. And I'm like barely taking care of myself. I can't fathom what it's like to keep up with your job, have a kid while at the same time doing like an international move. And all these things.
[00:19:24.430] 兄弟，你说的关于经济方面的问题也很有道理。我爸妈生我的时候，我爸34岁，我妈大概30岁左右。跟我们现在的年龄差不多。当然，离30岁还有好几年呢。但30岁真的很快就要到了。我连自己都照顾不好。我简直无法想象，一边工作，一边照顾孩子，还要搬家到国外，这到底是什么感觉。
[00:19:53.430] I'm like, I barely want to go to like L.A. I'm like, L.A is too far. I don't want to go. Like imagine not speaking the language of the country you're in and having a child. Oh, my God. Horrible. Awful. Would never do it. It's just so brave. Yeah, it really is. Wow. I oftentimes ask my parents, would you have stayed in China if you could go back? And they're like, well, you know, they've spent the years. They've adjusted now.
[00:19:53.430] 我都不太想去洛杉矶。洛杉矶太远了，我不想去。想象一下，你身处一个语言不通的国家，还要生孩子。我的天哪，太可怕了，太糟糕了。我绝对不会这么做。这需要多大的勇气啊。真的，太勇敢了。哇。我经常问我爸妈，如果可以回到中国，你们还会选择留在那里吗？他们会说，嗯，你知道，他们已经在那里生活了这么多年，现在已经适应了。
[00:20:20.690] There's like a community or friend circle that they're a part of and they're used to it now. And I think their original goal of leaving China or, you know, just their home country was mostly fulfilled anyway. Because it was like, you know, more opportunity and that kind of stuff. And they're like, yeah.
[00:20:20.690] 他们融入了一个社群或朋友圈，现在已经习惯了。而且我觉得他们最初离开中国，或者说离开祖国的目标，基本上已经实现了。因为那里有更多机会之类的。他们也表示赞同。
[00:20:39.150] Like my parents were telling me realistically, if they had stayed in China, they don't know if they would be as quote unquote successful as they are right now in America because of just like how the economy works and like all that stuff. I guess like capitalism helped them here. Yeah, I think sometimes my parents also kind of imagine what it would have been like if they stayed in Korea instead of came here.
[00:20:39.150] 就像我父母坦诚地告诉我的那样，如果他们当初留在中国，他们不知道自己是否还能像现在在美国一样“成功”，因为经济运行机制等等因素都不一样。我想，资本主义确实帮了他们不少忙。是啊，我觉得我父母有时候也会想象，如果他们当初留在韩国而不是来美国，生活会是什么样子。
[00:21:05.210] And a big part of that, too, is like they will ask me, oh, what do you think it would have been like if you lived in Korea? Can you imagine what it would have been like if you grew up there? And then I'm like doing the thought exercise with them and stuff like that. But it's just crazy to think that there's like one choice really changed their life so significantly, you know, also ours in succession.
[00:21:05.210] 而且，他们还会问我，如果你生活在韩国会是什么样子？你能想象在那里长大会是什么感觉吗？然后我就会和他们一起做这样的思考练习。但想到仅仅一个选择就彻底改变了他们的人生，也改变了我们的人生，真是令人难以置信。
[00:21:28.670] And to have the weight of that kind of decision on your shoulders at like 28 or like 30 is just mind boggling to me. I wonder if they thought about that. Like, well, my kid will be an English speaking child. Yeah. An English speaking Asian. I do have to imagine it's probably different for like your parents and mine because my parents moved here after I was born. So I lived in Korea for the first like four years or so of my life.
[00:21:28.670] 28岁或30岁就要肩负起这样的重任，真是让我难以置信。我不知道他们有没有考虑过这个问题。比如，我的孩子以后会是个说英语的孩子。是啊，一个会说英语的亚洲人。我想你我父母的情况应该不一样，因为我父母在我出生后才搬到这里。所以我生命的前四年左右是在韩国度过的。
[00:21:57.490] So then I feel like that was truly like a move for like me and the family versus like for your parents. Not that I know anything about like the context, but I feel like because there's no kids there yet, maybe it's like a slightly different context. Maybe they're like, you know, we got to get out of here. And then, okay, I guess we have kids now. I love how we're just like guessing and like imagining. But yeah, it is pretty insane.
[00:21:57.490] 所以我觉得，这对我来说，和对你父母来说，搬家更像是我们全家的一次抉择。我并不了解具体情况，但我觉得，因为当时家里还没有孩子，所以情况可能略有不同。也许他们当时的想法是，我们得离开这里。然后，好吧，现在我们有孩子了。我喜欢这种猜测和想象的感觉。不过，确实挺疯狂的。
[00:22:25.070] I was like talking to my parents in April because that's when I had my birthday. I was like, I'm 27 now. Like I'm almost 30. And they're like, whoa, 27. Like we got married when we were 28. And my dad was like, you got one year left. And I was like, um, I don't think that's going to be a possibility. Oh, my God. Kind of a random question. But do you ever ask your parents why they had two kids? No. Oh.
[00:22:25.070] 我四月份的时候跟爸妈聊天，因为那是我生日。我说，我现在27岁了，快30了。他们就惊呼，哇，27岁。我们结婚的时候都28岁了。我爸说，你还有一年呢。我说，嗯，我觉得不太可能。我的天哪。问个有点跑题的问题。你有没有问过你爸妈为什么生了两个孩子？没有。哦。
[00:22:54.190] When I was much younger, like elementary school or something, I did ask them, whoa, how did you have one girl and one boy? So like perfectly. Right. My mom was like, oh, well, I just thought really hard. I was like, this one will be a girl and this one will be a boy. Dude, she manifested it. Holy shit. Dude, but she was probably just spewing bullshit to like answer my child brain. Yeah. But the thing is, my mom has a brother.
[00:22:54.190] 我小时候，大概小学的时候，问过他们，哇，你们怎么会生一个女儿一个儿子？感觉一切都那么完美。对吧。我妈说，哦，我当时就想了很久。我就想，这个肯定是女儿，这个肯定是儿子。天哪，她居然真的实现了。我的天啊。不过她可能只是为了满足我这个小屁孩的好奇心才胡说八道。是啊。但问题是，我妈有个兄弟。
[00:23:24.330] So they have two siblings in that house. And then my dad has two brothers. So they have three siblings. So I think they're probably used to having like at least two children. So that was probably what was in their mind. Like, oh, two children make sense anymore. We feel like it's a lot because they're kind of starting from ground zero here. Yeah, that's true. I feel like two is a pretty common number that you see within like people our generation. Like usually people have like at least one sibling.
[00:23:24.330] 所以他们家有两个兄弟姐妹。然后我爸爸也有两个兄弟。所以他们家有三个兄弟姐妹。我觉得他们可能习惯了至少有两个孩子。所以他们可能就是这么想的。比如，哦，两个孩子已经够多了。我们觉得孩子太多了，因为他们好像是从零开始。是啊，没错。我觉得在我们这代人里，两个孩子是很常见的。通常人们至少会有一个兄弟姐妹。
[00:23:54.370] Right. I think for my parents, I feel like they had like a long debate about having kids. And I'm not fully sure. But I have a feeling that maybe it wasn't as like easy of a decision for them. So then I'm very happy in this family. But when I was younger, I used to like beg for like siblings and stuff. But honestly, now that I'm older, I'm like, it's kind of nice being an only child. Like I love that I grew up with this kind of childhood. Yeah. Even though there's a ton of only child slander out there. It's okay.
[00:23:54.370] 对。我觉得我爸妈当初要不要孩子这件事，好像纠结了很久。我也不太确定，但我感觉对他们来说，这可能不是个容易的决定。所以，我现在在这个家庭里很幸福。不过我小时候，也总是吵着要兄弟姐妹什么的。但说实话，现在长大了，我觉得做独生子女也挺好的。我很喜欢这样的童年。是啊，虽然现在有很多关于独生子女的负面评价，但没关系。
[00:24:24.310] I'm basically an only child right now. As a sole child who lives at home right now. Is that how it works? But I remember like speaking of begging for siblings. When I was really young, probably like six. I was like, mom, I want a younger sibling. I was like, it's not too late, right? You can you can like give us one, right? And she was like, who's gonna take care of it? And I was like, I will. She just like laughed in my face.
[00:24:24.310] 我现在基本上算是独生子女了。就是那种独自住在家里的孩子。是这样吗？但我记得我小时候就吵着要弟弟妹妹。那时候我可能六岁吧。我就跟妈妈说，妈妈，我想要个弟弟妹妹。我说，现在还不晚吧？你可以给我们添一个，对吧？她就问，谁来照顾？我说，我来。她就笑我了。
[00:24:53.750] She's like, you're six. You don't even know how to multiply. Probably. I did learn later on, though, there was like considerations, I guess. But ultimately, they were just like, fuck it. Two children's good. Like this is the number. Yeah. It's so like weird to think about our parents making life decisions at the respective ages that they were in. And I think it's because like the youngest I remember of my parents,
[00:24:53.750] 她当时说，你才六岁，连乘法都不会。可能吧。不过后来我的确知道，当时肯定也有其他考虑。但最终，他们就觉得，管他呢，两个孩子就够了，就觉得这个数字刚刚好。是啊。想想父母在他们各自的年纪做出人生决定，感觉真的挺奇怪的。我想这可能是因为我记忆中父母最小的时候……
[00:25:23.390] at least like seeing them through my own eyes and not in a picture. They were probably what early 40s at the youngest, like late 30s or something. I just can't imagine them any younger than that. You're right. I think that's about the same age as I know them to be through pictures, maybe like mid 30s, but memories probably like late 30s to early 40s as well. Yeah, it's kind of crazy because these are like things that we kind of think about nowadays, right? Yeah.
[00:25:23.390] 至少就像亲眼见到他们一样，而不是只看照片。他们最年轻的大概也四十出头，三十多岁吧。我实在想象不出他们更年轻的样子。你说得对。我觉得这跟我从照片里看到的他们的年龄差不多，照片里大概三十多岁，但记忆里他们大概也是三十多岁到四十出头。是啊，这有点不可思议，因为这些都是我们现在才会想到的事情，对吧？是啊。
[00:25:52.490] Like in our lives, if I were to have children, how many would I want? Right. Do I want children? Like, you know, that kind of stuff. It's crazy because the decisions were already made for our parents as in like the time has passed, like the decisions have been made. And so when we think back to like the moment of decision making, it's like how could they have made any other decision than this one, right? Yeah, that's true. It's like difficult to think about the alternatives.
[00:25:52.490] 就像我们生活中会遇到的情况一样，如果我要孩子，我想要几个？没错。我想要孩子吗？诸如此类的问题。这很不可思议，因为我们父母当初做决定的时候，好像一切都已成定局，时间已经过去，决定也已经做出来了。所以当我们回想起他们做决定的那一刻，就会想，他们还能做出别的决定吗？对，确实如此。很难去想其他的选择。
[00:26:21.470] I think another funny thing too is like low key, sometimes my mom will spill the tea about like things that happened in the past. And they're like juicy stories. I mean, not that juicy, but she'll be like, oh my God, like this one Ajuma and I had like beef. Oh my God. Because like we went on like a couple's trip somewhere. This is obviously before I was born. So it was just like three like childless couples. Yeah. She did this and blah, blah, blah. So yeah, I don't really like her. Oh my God.
[00:26:21.470] 我觉得还有一件挺搞笑的事，就是我妈有时候会悄悄地跟我讲一些以前发生的事。都是些挺劲爆的故事。我的意思是，也没那么劲爆，但她会说：“我的天哪，比如我和阿朱玛以前闹矛盾。我的天哪。因为我们当时一起去旅行，那是在我出生之前。所以当时我们三个都是没有孩子的夫妇。对，她做了这个，然后巴拉巴拉巴拉。所以，嗯，我其实不太喜欢她。我的天哪。”
[00:26:49.870] And then I was like, wait, I go on couple's trips sometimes. Or like we go on like friend group trips, you know? And I don't think there's that many interesting things in my life where I'm like, oh my God, this is tea. And like enough to where I would like tell it to my kids like 30 years in the future. But still, I was like the possibility is there. Whoa. So speaking of couples, I have a question for you. How open about your dating life were you with your parents? Hmm.
[00:26:49.870] 然后我就想，等等，我有时候也会和伴侣一起旅行。或者像和朋友们一起旅行，你知道吗？我觉得我生活中并没有太多让我觉得“天哪，这可是八卦！”的趣事，也没有什么特别值得跟我讲的，那种30年后还能讲给孩子们听的。不过，我还是觉得这种可能性是存在的。哇哦。说到情侣，我有个问题想问你。你和父母谈恋爱的时候有多坦诚？嗯。
[00:27:19.210] In high school, I dated a couple of guys. Some of them were more, I guess, serious-ish than the others. Uh-huh. But I tried to introduce one of my boyfriends once to my parents. And then my dad was- In high school? Yeah. Oh my God. It wasn't anything like super serious. Right. Okay. That guy, it wasn't even a boyfriend actually. We were just talking at the time. I see. But we were like studying at the library together. Uh-huh. And then I was like, oh, like come say hi to my parents. They're like picking me up to the guy. So I texted my mom that.
[00:27:19.210] 高中时，我跟几个男生交往过。有些男生比较认真，我觉得比其他的要认真一些。嗯哼。我曾经试着把其中一个男朋友介绍给我爸妈。然后我爸——高中？对啊。我的天。其实我们关系没那么认真。对。好吧。那个男生，其实根本算不上男朋友。我们当时只是在聊天。我明白了。我们当时一起在图书馆学习。嗯哼。然后我就跟他说，哦，来跟我爸妈打个招呼吧。他们要来接我。所以我就给我妈发了短信。
[00:27:48.170] And my mom was like, no, your dad doesn't want to meet anyone who you're not going to marry. Oh my God. And I was like, okay, never mind. Don't come. You're like, sit the fuck back down. Yeah. That's so funny. But then later in high school, I did have like a more serious boyfriend. You know, I would like talk about him at home and like my parents knew I was hanging out with him and like dating him. And he came by my house once for like prom. And then right after that, boyfriend was James. Did you tell them about dating James? I guess it was harder because you were in college.
[00:27:48.170] 我妈说，不行，你爸不想见任何你不会结婚的人。我的天哪。我就说，好吧，算了，别来了。你当时就说，给我坐下。是啊，太搞笑了。不过后来到了高中，我确实交了个比较认真的男朋友。你知道，我会在家里跟他们聊起他，我爸妈也知道我跟他在一起，算是约会吧。他来过我家一次，好像是参加毕业舞会。然后紧接着，我就有了詹姆斯。你跟他们说过你跟詹姆斯约会的事吗？我觉得因为你上大学了，所以说起来比较难。
[00:28:17.890] So like you're farther apart physically. Yeah. So my mom, anytime I see her, I like tell her every single thing that's going on in my life. Oh my God. So she is like always looped in on the tea. She's your diary. Yeah, she is. I'm like, remember this. But my dad, I think there's more of like a choice to be made there of like, what should I share and when should I share this? But with James, I had a feeling that it was going to be very, very serious.
[00:28:17.890] 所以你们在物理上距离更远。是的。我妈，每次见到她，我都会跟她讲我生活中发生的每件事。我的天哪。所以她总是知道我的所有八卦。她就像我的日记本。对，她就是。我会说，记住这个。但我觉得跟我爸分享这件事，更多的是一种选择，比如，我应该分享什么，什么时候分享？但和詹姆斯在一起，我感觉事情会非常非常严重。
[00:28:45.150] Like even from before we made it official, I was like, I feel like this is like the guy. Whoa. I know. Wow. I had like a weird premonition. Whoa. I guess if you know, you know. That's true. IYKY. So then like once James and I were hanging out and I needed to drop by my dad's office, I drove there with James. Oh my God. And then James was in the car and I was like, oh, dad. And then my dad came out and he saw James in the car. And I was like, this is James. Like, this is my boyfriend.
[00:28:45.150] 甚至在我们正式交往之前，我就觉得，就是他了。哇哦。我知道。哇。我当时有一种奇怪的预感。哇哦。我想，如果你认识他，你就会知道。真的。你懂的。后来有一次，我和詹姆斯一起出去玩，我需要去我爸的办公室，我就和詹姆斯一起开车去了。我的天哪。然后詹姆斯就在车里，我就说，哦，爸。然后我爸出来，看到詹姆斯在车里。我就说，这就是詹姆斯。这就是我的男朋友。
[00:29:13.570] We were probably seeing each other for like six months or something at the time. And then my dad looked like so uncomfortable and flustered. And then later my mom was like, you should have given him a heads up. Like, why didn't you say anything? And I was like, I didn't think it was a big deal. Like James was in the car, you know. But my dad said he had a really good impression of James from like that day. So I guess it's kind of worked out. But James was just in the car. Yeah. But you know, James has like a very nice looking face.
[00:29:13.570] 当时我们大概交往了六个月左右吧。然后我爸看起来很不自在，也很慌张。后来我妈就说，你应该提前跟他说一声。问我为什么什么都没说。我说，我觉得没什么大不了的。詹姆斯当时就在车里，你知道的。但我爸说，从那天起，他对詹姆斯的印象就很好。所以我觉得事情算是圆满解决了。詹姆斯当时就在车里。是啊。不过你知道，詹姆斯长得确实挺帅的。
[00:29:41.530] He's like, yes, there was glare on the windows and I could only see his shoulders. But I had a great impression of him. Dude, my windows are definitely tinted too. That's so funny. Yeah. I guess the short answer is like, I'm pretty open with them about it. So I have not been open about it in the past, especially in like high school, junior high, that kind of stuff. Because, you know, parents are always like, oh, you should focus on your studies and all that kind of stuff. Right. Right.
[00:29:41.530] 他说，是啊，窗户反光很严重，我只能看到他的肩膀。但我对他印象很好。哥们儿，我家窗户也贴了膜。真逗。是啊。简单来说，我跟他们说得挺坦诚的。以前我没怎么跟他们说，尤其是在高中、初中那会儿。因为你知道，父母总是说，哦，你应该专心学习什么的。对。对。
[00:30:10.310] I'm sure they probably like had a vague idea of some stuff based on going to like dances and like proms and stuff. But I never like outright said anything. But then in college, I had a boyfriend who was like a pretty long term serious relationship. So then after that, I like started telling them more. Also funny story about meeting the parents and dads and moms and stuff. When it was time to basically introduce him to the parents. Yeah.
[00:30:10.310] 我敢肯定，他们可能从我参加过的舞会、毕业舞会之类的活动中，对我的情况有所了解。但我从来没直接跟他们说过什么。后来上了大学，我交了个男朋友，我们谈了很久的恋爱，关系很认真。之后，我就开始跟他们多说说。还有个挺有意思的故事，就是见家长那会儿。当时到了该把他介绍给父母的时候……嗯。
[00:30:39.390] My parents were both like, is it like serious? And I was like, we've been dating for like two or three years. That's serious. I was like, what do you mean? And they're like, oh, OK, yeah, we just don't want to like waste our time meeting someone who like you're not serious about, basically. And I was like, OK, I mean, I guess that makes sense. But like also, you know, but ever since being back in the Bay and since I live at home now,
[00:30:39.390] 我爸妈都问我，你们俩是认真的吗？我说，我们都交往两三年了，这很认真。我问，你们什么意思？他们说，哦，好吧，我们只是不想浪费时间认识一个你不认真对待的人。我说，好吧，我明白了。但是，你知道，自从我回到湾区，住在家里之后，
[00:31:04.070] because we're so close, like physically, it's hard to avoid sharing information. One time I was just like, oh, I'm going out. I'll be back later. And they're like, OK. And then I guess we're just kind of used to being like, where are you going? Right. And usually my answer is like, oh, to hang out with friends or whatever. And then this time I was just like, um, I had like an internal debate for like 30 seconds, but it felt like five minutes in my head.
[00:31:04.070] 因为我们关系很近，真的，很难避免分享信息。有一次我就说，哦，我要出去一下，晚点回来。他们就说，好的。然后我们好像就习惯了问，你要去哪儿？对吧。通常我的回答是，哦，和朋友出去玩什么的。但这次，我却……嗯……我内心挣扎了大概30秒，但感觉像过了五分钟。
[00:31:29.950] I was like, should I say, should I lie and be like, I'm going to hang out with friends or should I just like come clean and be like, I'm going on a date? Oh, my God. What did you end up saying? So I ended up just being like, whatever, I'll just say I'm going on a date. So I said that and they're like, wait, what? And it was like a random hinge date, too. So they were like, who is this guy? Do you know him? Like some dude I met off the internet. Oh, my God. I was like, no, he's a stranger.
[00:31:29.950] 我当时想，我该怎么说呢？该撒谎说我要和朋友出去玩，还是该坦白说我要去约会？我的天哪。你最后怎么说的？最后我就想，算了，就说我要去约会吧。我说完之后，他们就懵了，什么？而且还是那种随便找的约会。他们就问，这男的是谁？你认识他吗？好像是我在网上认识的。我的天哪。我说，不认识，他是个陌生人。
[00:31:59.430] They're like, wait, what the fuck? Then like, how do you know him? Like, why are you going on this date? And I was like, dude, that's just how we date now. And as I'm like explaining this, I was like, this is actually so weird. Like, we just fucking find some random person on the internet and we chat with them for a bit and we're like, OK, I'm going to go on a date with this dude. You're like seeing it from their perspective. Yeah. And they were like, what the fuck? And I was like, don't worry. Like, everyone does it now. You know, it's like the apps and stuff. And they're like, OK, yeah. But like, still, what the fuck? I think they were just shocked.
[00:31:59.430] 他们当时就懵了，心想：等等，这他妈什么鬼？然后又问：你怎么认识他的？为什么要跟他约会？我就说：哥们儿，我们现在就是这么约会的。我一边解释一边说：这真的太奇怪了。我们就是随便在网上找个陌生人，聊了一会儿，然后就说：好，我要跟这个人约会。你这是从他们的角度想的。对。他们当时就懵了，心想：这他妈什么鬼？我就说：别担心。现在大家都这么干。你知道，现在都是用各种交友软件。他们就说：好吧，是啊。但是，我还是觉得：这他妈什么鬼？我觉得他们当时都惊呆了。
[00:32:29.290] They were probably also shocked. Like, what the fuck? You told us the truth? That's so funny. So then I was like, yeah, OK, bye. And they're like, OK, bye. Stay safe. Have fun, I guess. I come back in the evening and they both like stayed up and waited for me to come home. Oh my god. For the goss. Yeah, exactly. They're like, oh my god, so how'd it go? They're like, I think, you know, they calmed down after I left. So when I came back, they're like, so how was he? Like, how'd it go? Is he nice? Like, how's he look? And I was like, oh, it was OK.
[00:32:29.290] 他们可能也吓了一跳。就像，什么鬼？你居然跟我们说实话？这也太搞笑了。然后我就说，好吧，拜拜。他们也说，好吧，拜拜。注意安全。玩得开心吧。我晚上回来的时候，他们俩都熬夜等我回家。我的天哪。为了八卦。对，没错。他们就问，我的天哪，怎么样？他们说，我觉得，你知道，我走后他们就平静下来了。所以我回来的时候，他们又问，他怎么样？怎么样？他好吗？他看起来怎么样？我就说，哦，还行。
[00:32:59.350] Like, whatever. And they're like, oh, so you're not going to see him again? And I was like, probably not. And they're like, OK. OK. That's so funny. That's like cute, though, because I feel like roommates will do that. You know, like tell your roommate you're going out on a date for safety reasons. And when you come back, you spill all the tea. But your parents are like your roommates. Yeah, it's been kind of funny. I think at this point in time, it's like we're all adults. It's very even ground. So it doesn't feel too awkward. Yeah.
[00:32:59.350] 就那样吧。然后他们就问，哦，所以你以后不会再见到他了？我说，大概不会吧。然后他们就说，好吧，好吧。这太搞笑了。不过也挺可爱的，因为我觉得室友之间也会这样。你知道，比如为了安全起见，跟室友说你要出去约会。然后回来之后，就把所有内幕都抖出来。但是你的父母就像你的室友一样。是啊，这挺有意思的。我觉得现在我们都成年了。彼此之间很平等。所以感觉不会太尴尬。是啊。
[00:33:27.170] Like the most is maybe I come back one night after they know that I've been out on a date or something. And it's funny to see them that they've like stayed up and waited and be like, so how was it? Dude, do you ever wonder if your parents gossip about you with each other? Oh, with each other. Yeah. And I use gossip very like lightly, you know, of like, oh, maybe they were speculating about your date or your like love life with each other in private.
[00:33:27.170] 最常见的情况是，我晚上出去约会什么的，回来的时候他们知道了。然后看到他们熬夜等着，问“怎么样？”，就觉得挺搞笑的。哥们儿，你有没有想过你爸妈会不会私下议论你？哦，私下议论。对啊。我用“议论”这个词的时候语气很轻，你知道，就是那种，哦，他们可能私下里会猜测你约会或者你的感情生活之类的。
[00:33:57.190] Maybe a little bit. But sometimes like the things that I expect them to, they like don't. Oh. Because sometimes I'll say something that like maybe I only told my mom. Yeah. And then my dad will be like, oh, like what's that or whatever. And then my mom will like answer because she knows. And I'm like, oh, so my mom didn't tell my dad. That's true. Like I've had that experience before, too.
[00:33:57.190] 可能有点儿吧。但有时候，比如我期待他们做的事，他们却不会说。哦。因为有时候我会说一些可能只跟我妈说过的事。对。然后我爸就会问，哦，那是什么之类的。然后我妈就会回答，因为她知道。我就想，哦，所以我妈没告诉我爸。确实如此。我也遇到过这种情况。
[00:34:24.030] Although I think in my family, it felt more normal because like me and my mom were so close. Right. But I think one of the hopes that I have is like when I have a kid, I hope that we're as close as me and my mom were. Yeah. Because love life wise, anytime I had a crush or a new boyfriend or even like breakups, I would always tell my mom everything. And she would honestly spend like hours comforting me after breakups and stuff.
[00:34:24.030] 虽然我觉得在我家，这种情况比较正常，因为我和我妈妈关系特别好。没错。但我希望，等我有了孩子，我们也能像我和我妈妈一样亲密。因为在感情方面，每次我有了喜欢的人、交了新男友，甚至是分手，我都会跟妈妈倾诉。而她真的会花好几个小时安慰我，尤其是在我分手之后。
[00:34:52.150] Speaking of breakups, after like a breakup in the past, my mom didn't really comfort me. But at one point she was just like, oh, are you sad? Like, how are you feeling? And then I answered her and she was like, OK. Wait, are you sad is crazy. That's so funny. It's like a doctor check in where they're just like, you good? OK, bye. But it was like maybe a month or two after like the actual breakup date. So things were like more calm.
[00:34:52.150] 说到分手，我以前分手的时候，我妈其实没怎么安慰我。但有一次她突然问我：“你难过吗？感觉怎么样？” 我回答了她，她就说：“好吧。” 等等，“你难过吗？” 这话也太奇怪了吧。真搞笑。就像医生例行检查一样，问“你还好吗？好的，再见。” 但那大概是分手后一两个月的事了。那时候气氛已经平静多了。
[00:35:22.370] And she was like, oh, like, are you sad? Like, how are you doing? Basically. Oh, my God. Once after a breakup, my mom was like, good. I didn't like that guy anyway. Oh, my God. And I was like, Jesus, mom, it's been like two hours into the breakup. Like, relax. Your mom is so supportive. My mom's like, have you ever thought about it from the other person's perspective? Actually, yeah, my mom will do that sometimes, too. Or she has. Once I was like, yeah, like we just broke up. This guy's the worst. Fuck this guy. And then my mom was like, he's not that bad.
[00:35:22.370] 她就问，哦，你难过吗？你过得怎么样？差不多就是这样。我的天哪。有一次分手后，我妈说，好啊。反正我也不喜欢那个男的。我的天哪。我就说，妈，我的天，分手才两个小时而已。放松点。你妈真是太支持你了。我妈会问，你有没有从对方的角度想过？其实，是啊，我妈有时候也会这么做。或者说，她以前就这么做过。有一次我说，是啊，我们刚分手。这男的太糟糕了。去他的。然后我妈就说，他没那么糟。
[00:35:51.970] I think you're just being mean. And I was like, are you my mom or are you his mom? OK, so last question about our parents. Have you ever felt like you were your parents' emotional support in any way? Maybe like not super directly. But last year, my mom's parents passed away. But I was still in New York.
[00:35:51.970] 我觉得你有点刻薄。我就问你，你到底是我妈还是他妈？好吧，最后一个关于我们父母的问题。你有没有觉得自己在情感上支持过父母？也许不是特别直接。去年，我外公外婆去世了。当时我还在纽约。
[00:36:15.950] So I felt really, really bad because I wanted to fly back home to like be with my mom. But I think I had a work event or like something was keeping me from leaving the city. Right. So what I did do was I texted my brother, asked him if he was like not too busy from work, if he was able to travel. So I told him like, if you're not too busy, I think you should fly home and spend some time with mom. I don't think she needs us to like comfort her.
[00:36:15.950] 所以，我当时真的很难过，因为我想飞回家陪妈妈。但好像是有什么工作上的事耽搁了，没法离开这座城市。对。所以我就给哥哥发了短信，问他工作是不是太忙，能不能过来。我说，如果你不忙的话，我觉得你应该飞回家陪陪妈妈。我觉得她不需要我们去安慰她。
[00:36:44.830] But like I think if she's around people, it like helps. That's true. With family. Right. Right. So he was like, OK. I think he spent a decent amount to like a couple of weeks, two or three weeks. And I would ask him, I'd be like, oh, how does mom seem? And he was like, dude, she seems normal. And I was like, oh, OK, then. Wait, you just like deployed your brother. Like your next mission is. I really did.
[00:36:44.830] 但我觉得如果她身边有人，情况会好一些。确实如此。和家人在一起。对。对。所以他就说，好吧。我想他花了相当长的时间，大概两三个星期吧。我会问他，我会说，哦，妈妈看起来怎么样？他说，兄弟，她看起来很正常。然后我就说，哦，好吧。等等，你刚把你弟弟派出去执行任务。你的下一个任务是。真的。
[00:37:13.530] I was like, OK, the drone out here in New York can't make it. So drone out there in Seattle, can you fly over to California? Oh, my God. Is this the benefit of having two children? Dude, maybe. I feel like my brother is not too emotional, but he's like, I think his emotional intelligence is pretty good. So he was just like, yeah, mom's like fine. But he was like, but I'll like stay around for a bit and like, you know, hang out with her basically.
[00:37:13.530] 我当时就想，好吧，纽约这边的无人机飞不到。那西雅图的无人机，你能飞到加州来吗？我的天哪。这就是有两个孩子的好处吗？哥们，也许吧。我觉得我弟弟不太情绪化，但他，我觉得他的情商还不错。所以他就说，嗯，我妈没事。但他又说，我会待一会儿，你知道，就陪陪她。
[00:37:42.650] And then I would, of course, like call her too. And when I did call, we like talked about it a little bit, like the parents passing away and things like that. And I want to say that it was helpful. Maybe it was something nice for her. Yeah. Hopefully. Damn, dude, that's so tough. I'm glad that you and your brother were able to like support your mom. But I do feel like losing your parents is probably like one of the biggest tragedies that happen in life. In like most people's lives, basically. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:37:42.650] 当然，我也会给她打电话。我打了电话，我们聊了一会儿，比如父母去世之类的。我想说，这或许对她有所帮助。也许对她来说也是一种安慰。是啊，但愿如此。哎，兄弟，这太难熬了。我很高兴你和你哥哥能照顾好你妈妈。但我觉得失去父母可能是人生中最惨痛的悲剧之一。基本上，对大多数人来说都是如此。是啊，是啊。
[00:38:11.970] And I just can't even imagine what that feeling is like. I think the hardest part was that at the time, it was still very difficult to travel to China because of like COVID restrictions and stuff. They were pretty sad. My mom and her brother were pretty sad about not being able to go back to China right away. But they went back actually very recently to like do some paperwork, sort through some of the stuff and just like start on a lot of the process. But they were both like, yeah, we can't go back alone.
[00:38:11.970] 我简直无法想象那种感觉。我觉得最难受的是，当时因为疫情限制之类的原因，去中国旅行仍然非常困难。他们当时很伤心。我妈妈和她哥哥因为不能马上回中国而很难过。不过他们最近回去办了一些手续，整理了一些东西，也开始着手处理一些事情。但他们俩都说，是啊，我们不能单独回去。
[00:38:41.310] We need each other to like step into our childhood home. So my grandparents, they lived in that home ever since my mom was like born there. Oh, wow. Like the home that they were living in is my mom's childhood home. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. I know, right? Oh my God. That must have been a really emotional trip for them. Probably. Yeah. Yeah. How about you?
[00:38:41.310] 我们需要彼此，就像回到我们小时候的家一样。我的祖父母，自从我妈妈出生在那里，他们就一直住在那里。哇哦。他们住的房子就是我妈妈小时候的家。哇。是啊。太不可思议了。是啊，对吧？我的天哪。对他们来说，那一定是一次非常感人的旅程。可能吧。是啊。是啊。你呢？
[00:39:07.730] I think for me, I don't have a specific moment that I can recall, but I do feel like I have been an emotional support for my mom from time to time. And I think a lot of it is just like, I imagine it's so difficult to move here in your 30s. Leave all your like high school, college friends behind and like have to start up an entire new social life and social network here. You make new friends and stuff. And my mom has a lot of friends that she's super close with.
[00:39:07.730] 我觉得对我来说，我记不起某个具体的瞬间，但我确实觉得我时不时地会给妈妈一些情感上的支持。而且我觉得很大程度上是因为，我能想象到，30多岁搬到这里真的很不容易。要离开所有的高中、大学朋友，然后在这里重新建立起一套全新的社交生活和人脉。你会结交新的朋友等等。我妈妈有很多关系非常亲密的朋友。
[00:39:37.870] But I imagine it's like kind of different because my mom is used to having like a lot of sisters by her side, right? My mom has like three sisters and a brother. But here, none of her sisters actually live in the US. So sometimes when I was younger, I felt like I was like a stand-in for my mom's sister. And I think it's part of why we're so close and have been able to be so close and share so much with each other. Because she's used to that kind of dynamic. Yeah.
[00:39:37.870] 但我猜情况应该不太一样，因为我妈妈习惯了身边有很多姐妹，对吧？我妈妈有三个姐妹和一个兄弟。但是，她的姐妹们都不住在美国。所以小时候，我有时感觉自己就像是我妈妈姐妹的替代品。我想，这也是我们关系这么亲密，能够彼此分享这么多事情的原因之一。因为她已经习惯了这种相处模式。是的。
[00:40:03.910] Yeah, I've just been thinking about it recently about like how unique that is. And I consider myself very lucky, especially as someone who's an only child, to like experience that bond. Sort of like through my mom. Yeah. Wow. So basically, if you want to have a sibling, just have a child. That's my plan. But that is nice.
[00:40:03.910] 是啊，我最近一直在想这件事，觉得这真的很特别。我觉得自己很幸运，尤其是作为独生子女，能体验到这种亲密关系。有点像是通过我妈妈。哇。所以基本上，如果你想要个兄弟姐妹，那就生个孩子吧。我也是这么打算的。不过这确实挺好的。
[00:40:26.810] I'm sure it's very familiar to her too, since you're her daughter and she has like sisters versus if you were like a son. Yeah, I think so. And I think kind of circling back to what we talked about in the beginning, because I have this type of relationship with my mom, I think I felt like my relationship with my dad was not as good, sort of. But then it doesn't really make sense to compare your relationship with your mom to your relationship with your dad. I feel like the older you get, they're kind of like two separate things.
[00:40:26.810] 我相信她也深有体会，毕竟你是她的女儿，而你对她来说就像姐妹一样，而不是像儿子一样。嗯，我想是这样。我觉得这有点像我们一开始聊的，因为我和妈妈的关系是这种类型，所以我感觉我和爸爸的关系就没那么好。但其实把和妈妈的关系跟和爸爸的关系比较没什么意义。我觉得年纪越大，这两种关系就越像是两回事。
[00:40:56.910] Yeah. Even though it's also like a different thing for your relationship with your parents as a unit. One of my goals for this year is to talk to my dad more. About golf? Yeah, about golf. I've been fucking sending photos of myself playing golf in the group chat. Nice. Getting some heart reacts on it. Oh yeah. My dad's still asking about our scores. I'm like, don't worry about it. It's bad. You guys can play in Texas. Yeah. So every time we go back, we play golf with my parents.
[00:40:56.910] 是啊。虽然这对你和父母作为一个整体的关系来说也是一种不同的体验。我今年的目标之一就是多和我爸聊聊。聊高尔夫？对，聊高尔夫。我一直在群聊里发自己打高尔夫的照片。不错。还收到了一些点赞。哦，对了。我爸还在问我们的成绩。我就说，别担心。成绩很差。你们可以在德州打。是啊。所以每次我们回去，都会和我爸妈一起打高尔夫。
[00:41:25.430] Just have to remind him that I'm like alive, you know, while we're apart. Yeah. And just like send photos. You're like, don't forget about me. You're one and only daughter. Dude, I actually called him for Father's Day and we had like a five minute conversation. And I was like, this is amazing. Like, I can't believe I could have just picked up the phone and called him my entire life. Oh my God. And I just like never did. Okay. I was a little confused in the beginning because I was like, is five minutes good or bad? Your face was like, what do I say? Baby steps. Baby steps.
[00:41:25.430] 我得提醒他，即使我们分开，我也还活着。对。就发些照片给他。就像在说，别忘了我。你是他唯一的女儿。老兄，我父亲节那天真的给他打了电话，我们聊了大概五分钟。我当时就想，这太棒了。我简直不敢相信，我这辈子竟然一直没能拿起电话给他打个电话。我的天哪。我以前从来没这么做过。好吧。一开始我有点懵，心想，五分钟算好还是不好？你当时的表情好像在说，我该说什么？慢慢来。慢慢来。
[00:41:55.670] What more can you talk about? After five minutes, we were both like, we gotta go. He wasn't like, oh, how's wedding planning going? Oh no. Dude. Okay. This is like we talked about last episode. Yeah. Guys don't follow up. They ask one question and then they're like, cool. I have all the information I need. Your mom was probably like, oh, how's Jisoo doing? Like, how's the wedding planning going? And your dad was probably like, oh, I didn't ask.
[00:41:55.670] 还有什么好聊的？五分钟后，我们俩都觉得该走了。他没问，婚礼筹备得怎么样了？哦不。哥们儿。好吧。这就像我们上一集聊到的。是啊。男生不会追问。他们问一个问题，然后就说，好了，我知道了。你妈可能问，Jisoo怎么样了？婚礼筹备得怎么样了？你爸可能说，哦，我没问。
[00:42:21.630] Dude, I think my parents like subvert the gender expectations though, because my dad is usually the more chatty one. And my mom's always trying to hang up as soon as possible. I'm like, mom, I have like stuff to tell you. She's like, oh, I guess I'm like, mom. Mom, there's more things on my agenda. She's already hung up? Yeah. When my mom talks to her sisters, my dad would be like, oh, how are like the kids doing and blah, blah, blah. My mom's like, I don't know. That's not what we talked about. What the fuck? Wait, that's so funny.
[00:42:21.630] 老兄，我觉得我爸妈好像有点颠覆性别刻板印象，因为我爸通常比较健谈。而我妈总是想尽快挂电话。我就说，妈，我还有事要跟你说。她就说，哦，我好像就说，妈，我还有事要说。她已经挂了？是啊。我妈跟她姐妹聊天的时候，我爸会问，哦，孩子们怎么样了，等等等等。我妈就说，我不知道。我们没聊这个。什么鬼？等等，这太搞笑了。
[00:42:49.290] So your phone calls with your mom are like two minutes. Well, I drag them out. Oh, okay. Because I'm like, I need you. But if it were up to your mom, it'd be like two minutes. Yeah. I see. At least she doesn't pick up the phone with like, what's wrong anymore? All right. Well, that's all the time we have for today. I think that was a very wholesome and heartwarming conversation. Lots of laughs, lots of good memories and some tough but funny memories too.
[00:42:49.290] 所以你跟你妈妈的通话时间只有两分钟？嗯，我故意拖延时间。哦，好吧。因为我觉得，我需要你。但如果由你妈妈说了算，通话时间可能也就两分钟。是啊，我明白了。至少她现在接电话不会再问“怎么了？”了。好的。今天就聊到这里吧。我觉得这是一次非常温馨感人的谈话。我们笑了很多次，回忆了很多美好的往事，当然也有一些艰难但有趣的记忆。
[00:43:17.170] I feel like it's always nice to reflect on our relationship with our parents because sometimes it feels like we're like speeding through stages of life lately. True. Especially you probably because you have a lot of things lined up like big wedding at the end of the year. And then from there, I feel like a lot of things just change after that. And a lot more like questions are asked, things are considered. Right.
[00:43:17.170] 我觉得回顾一下我们和父母的关系总是很有意义的，因为感觉我们最近好像一直在飞速地经历人生的各个阶段。确实如此。尤其是你，可能因为你有很多事情要忙，比如年底的大型婚礼。然后，我觉得之后很多事情都会发生变化。你会提出更多问题，也会思考更多事情。没错。
