[00:00:00.180] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo. I have a confusing Gen Z word for us to discuss today. Okay, actually, I'm not even sure if this is a Gen Z word. It might be Gen Alpha. At this point
[00:00:00.180] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。今天我们要讨论一个让人困惑的Z世代词汇。好吧，实际上，我甚至不确定这算不算Z世代词汇。它也可能属于阿尔法世代。目前来看……
[00:00:24.780] I'm not like sure where the slang is coming from anymore. But the word is Sigma and I only know part of it. I don't see it as much now on TikTok, but for a period of time
[00:00:24.780] 我不太确定这个俚语的来源了。但这个词是Sigma，我只知道它的一部分。现在在TikTok上很少看到它了，但之前有一段时间很常见。
[00:00:39.020] I was seeing it a decent amount. And from my understanding, there's like the phrase alpha male right and like beta or whatever and so sigma is almost like an alternative to
[00:00:39.020] 我经常看到这个词。据我了解，好像有“阿尔法男”和“贝塔男”之类的说法，而“西格玛男”几乎可以算是它们的另一种说法。
[00:00:51.460] Alpha without the like baggage of that word almost. And I feel like when I do hear it being used It's a little more like sarcastic or maybe like ironic it definitely doesn't carry that like really heavily gendered or like
[00:00:51.460] 几乎完全没有“Alpha”这个词的负面含义。我觉得当我听到有人用这个词的时候，语气更像是讽刺或者反讽，它绝对没有那种强烈的性别色彩。
[00:01:08.220] baggage as I mentioned of the word alpha and I think it's supposed to be a good thing. Like if you're a Sigma character, you're supposed to be it's like kind of a positive thing slash like funny thing
[00:01:08.220] 正如我之前提到的“alpha”这个词，我觉得它应该是件好事。比如，如果你是Sigma类型的人，你应该……这应该算是一种积极或有趣的特质。
[00:01:22.180] Do you actually didn't know like the connotations of the word Sigma that much but I Do see it used in the wild kind of like a synonym to alpha like you said or to Chad almost
[00:01:22.180] 你其实不太了解Sigma这个词的含义，但我确实看到它在实际生活中被用作类似Alpha的同义词，就像你说的，或者几乎就是Chad的同义词。
[00:01:34.420] So it's like oh, he's a sigma male or like Sigma woman or whatever Just means that they're like really on top of like the food chain almost but this one is weird because I feel like I've also seen it evolve where
[00:01:34.420] 所以这就好比，哦，他是西格玛男性或者西格玛女性之类的，这基本上意味着他们几乎处于食物链的顶端。但这个很奇怪，因为我觉得我也见过它演变成……
[00:01:48.580] Recently my husband went to go play like volleyball at open gym open gym has like a variety of different ages So some of the people he was playing with were Teenagers and he said that after getting like a score or something
[00:01:48.580] 最近我丈夫去露天体育馆打排球，那里有很多不同年龄段的人，他一起打球的有些是青少年。他说，在得了一分之后……
[00:02:01.580] They would turn to each other and be like erm, what the Sigma and I was like wait, what the fuck? I've never heard that phrase in my life I Don't know this version of It has evolved beyond my comprehension
[00:02:01.580] 他们会互相看着对方，然后说：“呃，这是什么鬼东西？”而我则一脸懵逼：“等等，这他妈什么鬼？我这辈子都没听过这种说法。我不知道这个版本的‘It’已经发展到我无法理解的地步了。”
[00:02:20.380] The Sigma that I know it's connected to some Sigma face and the origin of the Sigma face Allegedly is from the movie American Psycho and apparently there's this one scene where Christian Bale actor he makes this like
[00:02:20.380] 我所知道的Sigma符号与某种Sigma脸有关，而Sigma脸的起源据说来自电影《美国精神病人》，而且显然在其中一个场景中，克里斯蒂安·贝尔饰演的演员做出了类似的表情。
[00:02:37.980] Weird kind of like eyebrow raise like purse-lipped face and people were saying like that's the Sigma face Do I've seen that and I remember for a period of time that was like all I could see on tik-tok just people doing the
[00:02:37.980] 有点怪，就像扬眉抿嘴一样，人们都说那是“Sigma脸”。我见过，而且我记得有一段时间，我在TikTok上看到的全是这种表情，人们都在做。
[00:02:50.400] Sigma face same. I'm so curious how it evolved from that to like erm what the Sigma like what? What happened but I remember the evolution there at least as far as I saw There's Sigma Riz or something
[00:02:50.400] Sigma 的脸型一样。我很好奇它是怎么从那样演变成现在这样，呃，Sigma 到底是什么样子的？发生了什么？但我记得至少就我所见，它好像有 Sigma Riz 之类的东西。
[00:03:05.940] Whoa, and then that was kind of just being an independent person and like having yourself kind of put together And that's like the Sigma character that like has this like independent Riz kind of all ironic slash sarcastic In a way, that's like the extent of my Sigma knowledge
[00:03:05.940] 哇，然后，这就像是做一个独立的人，把自己打理得井井有条。这就像Sigma这个角色，拥有像Riz那样独立自主、略带讽刺挖苦的性格。某种程度上，这就是我对Sigma的全部了解了。
[00:03:25.500] Dude this is fascinating. I wish you could like get a gen alpha person on and just like grill their brain Okay, but sometimes some of these slang words just mean nothing like scooby-doo true scooby-doo toilet Riz
[00:03:25.500] 老兄，这太有意思了。我真希望你能找个阿尔法世代的人来，好好拷问一下他们的脑子。好吧，但有时候这些俚语根本毫无意义，比如“史酷比”和“真正的史酷比”厕所。
[00:03:40.340] Yeah, I swear I've seen a tik-tok of like people asking what scooby-doo means sometimes it's in games, right? They get matched with like these really young people who say it and they're like, what does that mean? And then the kids like dude, I don't know scooby-doo
[00:03:40.340] 对啊，我发誓我看过一个TikTok视频，里面有人问“史酷比”是什么意思，有时候会在游戏里出现，对吧？他们会匹配到一些很小的孩子，这些孩子会说“史酷比”，然后他们就问：“这是什么意思？” 然后这些孩子就说：“兄弟，我不知道史酷比是什么意思。”
[00:03:56.780] It's like a soundbite Dude, they're just playing us actually Well regardless of Sigma and scooby-doo Let's go to the real topic that we have for the episode today, which is taking the initiative with family
[00:03:56.780] 这就像一段简短的采访片段，伙计，他们其实只是在耍我们。好吧，不管西格玛和史酷比，我们还是回到今天这期节目的真正主题，那就是主动与家人相处。
[00:04:10.940] I think one of the themes that we often mention when it comes to talking about family is that as children We just hold so much less responsibility But now that we are a little bit older a little bit more settled. We wanted to explore how
[00:04:10.940] 我认为，在谈论家庭时，我们经常提到的一个主题是，小时候我们承担的责任很少。但现在我们年纪稍长，生活也更稳定了。我们想探讨一下……
[00:04:26.380] We choose to be more active members of the family and what kind of new roles we take on Yeah, and I feel like now especially as more and more of us are living Independently of our parents a lot of decisions truly fall into our own
[00:04:26.380] 我们选择成为家庭中更积极的成员，并承担新的角色。是的，我觉得现在尤其如此，随着越来越多的人独立于父母生活，很多决定真正落到了我们自己手中。
[00:04:42.100] Plates now, so I guess like one of the biggest and like most obvious choices that we're able to Take full control over is how often do you visit your parents if you're not living with them?
[00:04:42.100] 现在来说说餐盘，所以我想，我们能够完全掌控的最大、最显而易见的选择之一就是，如果你不和父母住在一起，你多久去看望他们一次？
[00:04:56.260] Which is actually something that I've kind of been thinking about because as I mentioned a few months ago I felt ready to like move out from home and Luckily, I have succeeded
[00:04:56.260] 其实我一直在考虑这件事，因为就像我几个月前提到的那样，我觉得我已经准备好搬出家了，幸运的是，我已经成功了。
[00:05:07.860] I've succeeded in doing so and so now I'm kind of starting to find my new routine and figure out all these new things now that I'm
[00:05:07.860] 我已经成功做到了这一点，所以现在我开始慢慢适应新的生活节奏，并弄清楚所有这些新事情。
[00:05:17.100] Living on my own one of them is like how often should I go back home and you know, hang out with my parents? How do you find yourself determining these things I think for me my parents have moved around a little bit Since I've moved out the house
[00:05:17.100] 独自生活后，我面临的问题之一就是：我应该多久回家一次，和父母聚聚？你是如何决定这些问题的？我觉得对我来说，自从我搬出去后，我的父母也搬过几次家。
[00:05:33.860] So then how often I could visit them did really depend on where they were living at the time now They're obviously very very settled in Texas and I don't think they will leave anytime soon But for example when they were living in Korea for a bit
[00:05:33.860] 所以，我能多久去看望他们一次，真的取决于他们当时住在哪里。他们现在显然在德克萨斯州生活得很安定，我想他们近期不会离开。但比如，他们之前在韩国住过一段时间。
[00:05:50.180] I was like, okay once a year is how often I should go because otherwise it would be like financially a strain probably and especially With my income at the time. I was like, I can't afford
[00:05:50.180] 我当时想，好吧，一年一次比较合适，不然经济上可能会比较吃紧，尤其是我当时的收入水平。我当时想，我负担不起。
[00:06:00.260] Plane ticket more than that. And then when they were living on the East Coast I was thinking maybe like twice a year or so and now that they're in Texas. I think the flight time is a lot
[00:06:00.260] 机票钱可不止这些。以前他们住在东海岸的时候，我想着可能一年也就去看他们两次，现在他们搬到德克萨斯州了，我觉得飞行时间太长了。
[00:06:11.300] Closer, it's maybe like three and a half hours or something versus the almost six that it was to visit them in the East Coast
[00:06:11.300] 距离近一些的话，大概只需要三个半小时左右，而去东海岸拜访他们则花了将近六个小时。
[00:06:17.580] So I kind of want to do more like weekend trips and whatnot, but realistically it's been about two to three times a year so far Yeah, I feel like it's pretty hard regardless of distance if they're just out of state, right?
[00:06:17.580] 所以我想多安排一些周末旅行之类的活动，但实际上到目前为止一年也就两到三次。是啊，我觉得如果他们不在本州，不管距离远近，都很难安排，对吧？
[00:06:30.820] If you just have to take a flight it Exponentially increases the effort and like the planning for these trips. Yeah Mm-hmm. I could definitely feel that too when like I was in the East Coast and then you know, like coming back home
[00:06:30.820] 如果你非得坐飞机，那准备这些行程的精力和计划工作量就会成倍增加。嗯，没错。我之前在东海岸的时候，还有回家的时候，也深有体会。
[00:06:47.100] it was usually just focused on the holidays because Otherwise regular timing is a little harder to plan around, you know work around PTO Days off. So I feel like when your parents were living in Korea
[00:06:47.100] 通常只关注节假日，因为平时的时间安排比较难协调，比如要配合休假时间。所以我觉得你父母在韩国生活的时候，工作安排就比较集中。
[00:07:01.700] That must have been the hardest time to like it's it's like so far that you're like, okay now I have to make this into Like basically a vacation, right?
[00:07:01.700] 那一定是很难熬的时期，就像是，到目前为止，你会想，好吧，现在我必须把它变成一次度假，对吧？
[00:07:11.340] Yeah, true and maybe it was kind of easier in a sense because the decision was already pre-made it's like, okay I will go visit them and stay for like 10 days or something
[00:07:11.340] 是啊，没错，某种程度上来说可能更容易些，因为决定已经做好了，就像是，好吧，我去拜访他们，待个十天左右。
[00:07:21.200] I feel like is almost the minimum that I would do if I were to go so far But now that they're in Texas, I feel like the distance is kind of shorter
[00:07:21.200] 我觉得这几乎是如果我要去那么远的地方，我会做的最低限度了。但现在他们在德克萨斯州，我觉得距离好像缩短了。
[00:07:30.260] So then it puts me at this weird spot where I'm like, oh, I feel like I could just go and do like a weekend trip But then that means I'm not actually like booking the flights, you know I see and then it also
[00:07:30.260] 所以这就让我陷入了一种很尴尬的境地，感觉好像可以来个周末旅行似的。但那样的话，我就不用真的订机票了，你知道，我明白了，而且也……
[00:07:40.600] Makes me think like, oh, maybe my parents should just come and visit me and like stay with us So then there's just like a lot of back and forth like way more
[00:07:40.600] 这让我想到，哦，也许我父母应该来看看我，和我们住一段时间。然后就有很多来回的讨论，比之前多得多。
[00:07:48.280] Decisions and like things to consider versus when they were in Korea. It's like I will visit you and I will stay for 10 days Oh, yeah, that's a good point You actually bring up another interesting factor, which is like should your parents be visiting you too, right?
[00:07:48.280] 和他们在韩国时相比，现在需要考虑的事情和决定都不一样了。比如，我会去看你，待上十天。哦，对，你说得对。你确实提出了另一个有趣的问题，那就是你的父母是否也应该来看你，对吧？
[00:08:03.520] And I guess the only thing that I kind of have to go off of this is Mainly like when I was younger my grandparents live in China So the model that I've like grown up with is literally, you know
[00:08:03.520] 我猜我唯一能参考的就是，我小时候，我的祖父母住在中国，所以我从小接触的模式就是，你知道的。
[00:08:17.520] international travel and like the grandparents rarely come visit us in the States because they're getting older and like You know making those trips is harder for them or maybe they're just like really busy in China And they're like now we can't Just fly over
[00:08:17.520] 国际旅行，还有祖父母很少来美国看我们，因为他们年纪大了，你知道，对他们来说，出行越来越困难，或者他们可能只是在中国很忙。他们说，现在我们不能随便飞过去了。
[00:08:34.280] So now it's different because my parents and your parents are not out of country, right? And so I guess we have to reestablish the normal that we know Yeah, totally
[00:08:34.280] 所以现在情况不一样了，因为我的父母和你的父母都不在国外，对吧？所以我想我们必须重新建立我们熟悉的正常生活。是的，完全正确。
[00:08:46.280] and I feel like things will also change once we have kids and whatnot to like I always think about that because It's been on my mind a little bit more lately and I'm like, how will I? Know how to integrate
[00:08:46.280] 我觉得一旦有了孩子，事情也会发生变化，诸如此类。我总是会想到这一点，因为最近我一直在想，我该如何融入其中呢？
[00:08:59.520] grandparents into like the nuclear family lifestyle because like you said What I know and what I can reference is like my grandparents being in Korea
[00:08:59.520] 祖父母喜欢核心家庭的生活方式，因为就像你说的，我所了解和可以参考的是我的祖父母在韩国的生活。
[00:09:08.080] So then if they were to visit they would stay for like a month or two or whatever or we would go and visit them But I don't know how it works for the grandparents being in a different state
[00:09:08.080] 所以如果他们来探望，他们会待上一两个月什么的，或者我们会去看望他们。但我不知道祖父母在另一个州的情况该怎么安排。
[00:09:17.000] so all these new avenues to explore and not having a reference point means there's a lot of new processes that like you yourself have to set up Yeah, and I think I'm definitely in that
[00:09:17.000] 所以，所有这些新的探索方向，加上没有参照点，意味着有很多新的流程需要你自己去建立。是的，我想我肯定也身处其中。
[00:09:28.360] Situation too now where I'm like thinking about the new norm to have like it's only been a short period of time since I've moved out so I'm still like figuring out what makes sense. And I mean luckily for me my parents are living quite close to me
[00:09:28.360] 现在的情况是，我正在思考新的生活方式，毕竟搬出去的时间还不长，我还在摸索什么才是合理的。幸运的是，我的父母就住在我家附近。
[00:09:45.040] Right. It is very easy to just like drive over and hang out with them But kind of like you said sometimes the easier it is the more you're just like oh it's so easy
[00:09:45.040] 对。开车过去跟他们待一会儿确实很容易。但就像你说的，有时候越容易，你就越会觉得“哦，这太容易了”。
[00:09:55.640] I can do it later or like I can just do it whenever and then that ends up making you procrastinate And like not do anything right now, though I don't have a routine necessarily but because I'm sometimes like oh my god
[00:09:55.640] 我可以晚点再做，或者说我可以随时做，但这样反而会让我拖延，什么都不做。虽然我并没有什么固定的习惯，但有时候我会想，我的天哪
[00:10:09.200] I need this one thing and it's actually back home. So I guess I'll just drive over on the weekend and grab it Leave That's so nice. Definitely super fortunate that I get to live by myself but also like super close to my parents and
[00:10:09.200] 我需要一样东西，它其实在家里。所以我想我周末开车过去拿吧。真好。我很幸运能一个人住，而且离父母也很近。
[00:10:25.320] You know speaking of having kids and you know having grandparents in the nuclear family That was a thought that I had when I was younger growing up I was thinking like, you know, I love my grandparents a lot
[00:10:25.320] 你知道，说到有孩子，还有祖父母在核心家庭里，我小时候就想过这个问题，当时我就想，你知道，我非常爱我的祖父母。
[00:10:36.680] But I only get to see them probably like once a year and sometimes even less So I made a mental note when I was young that like oh I want to live somewhat close to my parents at least like the same country as my parents because that way
[00:10:36.680] 但我大概一年只能见他们一次，有时甚至更少。所以我小时候就暗暗决定，要尽可能住在离父母近的地方，至少住在同一个国家，因为那样……
[00:10:51.240] You know if I were to have kids then they can be a bigger part of that kid's life, right? I know and it's so funny to like even think about these things more seriously now because I think when we're young
[00:10:51.240] 你知道，如果我有了孩子，他们就能更多地参与到孩子的生活中，对吧？我知道，现在认真思考这些事情感觉很滑稽，因为我觉得我们年轻的时候……
[00:11:04.320] It's so much more conceptual. Yeah, and then in your like 20s and 30s It's your real life like you're impending future essentially But it's so nice because I know at least seeing my mom and her relationship with her mom
[00:11:04.320] 它更偏向概念层面。是啊，到了二三十岁，那就是你的真实生活，就像你即将面对的未来。但这样也挺好的，因为我知道至少我能看到我妈妈和她妈妈之间的关系。
[00:11:17.640] there's just so much that you're unable to like share with your parents when they're overseas and You know, you want to cherish the moments that you're together, but maybe that means on the day-to-day you're not necessarily able to like rely on them or
[00:11:17.640] 当父母身在海外时，有很多事情你无法与他们分享。你知道，你想珍惜与他们相处的时光，但这可能意味着在日常生活中，你未必能够完全依赖他们。
[00:11:32.080] You're not able to support them that much except just like sending money or something like that So then it is a really big privilege to be able to live in the same country as your parents for sure
[00:11:32.080] 除了寄钱之类的，你没办法给他们提供太多帮助。所以，能和父母生活在同一个国家，绝对是一种莫大的荣幸。
[00:11:43.320] Speaking of sharing things with your parents. How do you decide like what you? Share with your family, like you said sometimes it's harder to share the day-to-day things with them
[00:11:43.320] 说到和父母分享事情，你怎么决定要和家人分享什么呢？就像你说的，有时候和他们分享日常琐事比较难。
[00:11:53.880] Especially if you're not seeing them like every day or weekly so like some things I think about is oh I guess now, you know if I were to just go out and travel for like a quick weekend trip
[00:11:53.880] 尤其是如果你不能像以前那样每天或每周都见到他们，所以我会想，哦，我想现在，你知道，如果我出去旅行，比如来个短暂的周末旅行。
[00:12:05.280] Do I even communicate with that with my parents like I don't have to and it's like so weird sometimes to think of that Like almost severed like line of communication Do I know I feel like when you live with someone there's just so much
[00:12:05.280] 我甚至还会和父母交流吗？我感觉好像没必要，但有时候想到这一点就觉得很奇怪，就像沟通渠道几乎被切断了一样。我知道，我觉得和别人住在一起，有很多事情需要处理。
[00:12:18.560] Small like day-to-day communication that you do and the ones you don't live with them anymore You're like, whoa, I have to like manually update Yeah, like if you know, I'm living with my parents any sort of travel
[00:12:18.560] 比如日常沟通这种小事，还有那些你不再和他们住在一起的沟通，你会觉得，哇，我得手动更新。是啊，比如你知道，我现在和父母住在一起，任何形式的旅行
[00:12:31.040] They'll have to know cuz I can't just like not show up at home for a weekend They'll be like wait, what is going on? Like where are you? Are you okay? So it's like, you know a quick
[00:12:31.040] 他们肯定得知道，因为我不可能周末就这么不回家。他们会问，等等，怎么回事？你在哪儿？你还好吗？所以，你知道，得赶紧……
[00:12:39.880] Hey, I might be out this weekend versus now. It's like well, they don't see me every day So if I were to just like be out for a weekend They wouldn't know but I could like send them a text if they really wanted to know I guess
[00:12:39.880] 嘿，我这周末可能不在家，而不是现在。反正他们也不是每天都见到我。所以如果我周末不在家，他们就不会知道，不过如果他们真的想知道，我可以给他们发个短信问问。
[00:12:53.080] so one of the things that kind of helped I Think ease the minds of me and my parents is we all track each other's locations
[00:12:53.080] 所以，我觉得让我和父母都安心不少的一件事就是我们互相追踪彼此的位置。
[00:13:03.040] So my mom and I have iPhones so we have each other on by my friends and then my dad has an Android so I track him or we track each other on Google Maps and
[00:13:03.040] 我和我妈妈都用iPhone，所以我们可以通过我的朋友互相追踪对方的位置；我爸爸用安卓手机，所以我可以通过谷歌地图追踪他的位置，或者我们也可以互相追踪对方的位置。
[00:13:11.600] I just feel so much better about it. And I think they do too because sometimes when life is really busy I don't always have the headspace to like text my parents and be like, oh like I'm doing this
[00:13:11.600] 我感觉好多了。而且我觉得他们也是，因为有时候生活太忙的时候，我真的没空给父母发短信说，哦，我在做这个
[00:13:22.160] Or I might talk about a trip more vaguely like oh, I'm gonna go to Europe for two weeks or something like that, right? I think by using find my friends. My mom was like able to text me throughout the honeymoon
[00:13:22.160] 或者我可能会更笼统地谈论旅行，比如“哦，我要去欧洲两周”之类的，对吧？我觉得通过“查找我的朋友”功能，我妈妈在整个蜜月期间都能给我发短信。
[00:13:33.080] Like oh, I see you guys are in Paris now or like I see you guys got to Switzerland safely And then she knows that I'm safe and well and like still traveling Yeah, and then on the other side
[00:13:33.080] 比如，哦，我看到你们现在在巴黎了，或者，我看到你们安全抵达瑞士了。然后她就知道我平安无事，还在旅行。是的，然后，在另一边……
[00:13:43.520] I also worry about my parents and I'm also like oh my god My mom's not picking up and or like she hasn't called me back and it's been like six hours
[00:13:43.520] 我也很担心我爸妈，我经常会想，天哪，我妈不接电话，或者说她还没回我电话，都六个小时了。
[00:13:51.800] Like usually she calls me back. I wonder what's up? And then I check the location and I see that she's at home so like there's Ways, you know or like little checkpoints to assure each other of our safety
[00:13:51.800] 她像往常一样给我回了电话。我心想怎么回事？然后我查看了她的位置，发现她在家。你知道，我们之间有一些方法，或者说一些小小的安全检查点，来确保彼此的安全。
[00:14:02.720] Without having to constantly be texting or calling each other. Yeah, that has been super big That makes a lot of sense. Honestly, okay I have a weird find my friends situations with my parents
[00:14:02.720] 不用总是发短信或打电话。是啊，这真的太棒了。这很有道理。说实话，我和我父母之间在寻找朋友方面有点奇怪。
[00:14:14.800] Back in the day when iPhones first were like starting at big and find my friends first came out My parents did use find my friends on me to make sure that I was getting home safely after school because they couldn't pick me
[00:14:14.800] 想当年iPhone刚问世的时候，就像是“查找我的朋友”功能刚推出的时候，我的父母就用这个功能来确保我放学后安全到家，因为他们没法来接我。
[00:14:28.880] Up, so I usually just like walked home or biked home But then after a while, we just stopped using it because I guess like high school ended And Then the roles have been reversed now kind of like what you said, right now
[00:14:28.880] 早上起来，所以我通常就走回家或者骑车回家。但过了一段时间，我们就不用了，大概是因为高中毕业吧。然后角色就反过来了，就像你刚才说的，现在这样。
[00:14:42.800] I'm worrying about like where my parents are So I actually added my mom onto my find my friends So that I can like track her sometimes if I don't know where she is or like she's getting home really late
[00:14:42.800] 我很担心我爸妈在哪儿，所以我把妈妈加到了“查找我的朋友”里，这样如果我不知道她在哪儿，或者她很晚才回家，我就可以追踪她的位置了。
[00:14:56.440] But then I haven't added my dad and so that has caused some issues Because one time when my mom was like on a trip or something and it was just me and my dad at home
[00:14:56.440] 但是我还没把爸爸加进去，这就造成了一些问题。因为有一次我妈妈好像出差了，家里只有我和我爸。
[00:15:05.760] I got home like a Friday evening after work and it gets to like 8 or 9 p.m And I'm like, oh that's weird. Like normally my dad is home by like 8 ish I wonder where he is and I was like, okay
[00:15:05.760] 那天是周五晚上，我下班回家，大概八九点钟的时候，我就觉得很奇怪。平时我爸八点左右就到家了，我就纳闷他去哪儿了，然后我就想，好吧。
[00:15:17.320] I'll give it like an hour before I like start to worry and then you know an hour passes and he's still not home I'm like, okay. This is definitely Getting to the weird territory because my dad's like bedtime is literally around 1030
[00:15:17.320] 我等了一个小时左右才开始担心，然后你知道，一个小时过去了，他还没回家，我就想，好吧。这绝对有点奇怪了，因为我爸的睡觉时间是晚上十点半左右。
[00:15:33.760] So, how is he still not home? It's like almost 11 and so I call him but it goes straight to voicemail I'm like, that's when I start to like freak out about my oh my god, where could he be? Yeah, and I'm thinking in my head like okay
[00:15:33.760] 所以，他怎么还没回家？都快11点了，我给他打电话，结果直接转到语音信箱。我当时就想，天哪，他到底在哪儿？我心里想着，好吧
[00:15:47.360] There is a slight possibility that my dad could be out like camping or something because he likes to camp But I was like, but he never told me so I'm like, I can't be sure So I'm like, okay, I'll give it another 20 minutes before I call again
[00:15:47.360] 我爸有可能出去露营什么的，因为他喜欢露营。但他从来没跟我说过，所以我也不敢肯定。所以我就想，好吧，我再等20分钟再打电话吧。
[00:16:02.680] Like maybe he just doesn't have service right now So I wait 20 minutes and I give another call and then this time he does pick up and I'm like, oh my god
[00:16:02.680] 也许他现在没信号，所以我等了20分钟又打了一次，这次他接了，我当时就想，我的天哪
[00:16:09.400] Like where are you? What's going on? Are you okay? Are you coming home today? And he was like, oh crystal I'm like climbing Mount Shasta right now Just casually And I was like wait What? He was like, yeah, don't worry about me
[00:16:09.400] 我问他：“你在哪儿？发生什么事了？你还好吗？你今天回家吗？” 他说：“哦，克丽丝塔尔，我现在正在爬沙斯塔山呢，就随便爬爬。” 我当时就懵了，什么？ 他说：“是啊，别担心我。”
[00:16:24.400] Like I'll be home in about a day or so climbing Mount Shasta with some friends right now. I was like, okay So I hang up I'm like, okay. Well now at least I know where he is, but I'm just like why didn't you tell me?
[00:16:24.400] 就像我现在正和朋友们一起爬沙斯塔山，大概一两天后就能回家。我当时就想，好吧，然后我就挂断了电话，心想，好吧。至少现在我知道他在哪儿了，但我就是想，你为什么不告诉我？
[00:16:36.720] Dude, it's truly role reversal. Like it sounds like you have to establish some ground rules You might need to actually ground him for a week It turns out it was a last-minute trip because I don't know there was like a couple weeks where
[00:16:36.720] 老兄，这角色完全颠倒了。听起来你得给他定些规矩。你可能真的需要禁足他一周。原来这是一次临时起意的旅行，因为我不知道，大概有两周时间……
[00:16:54.040] there was news about like potentially being able to see the northern lights in like North America and so Him and his friends were like, hey, let's go climb Mount Shasta to see if we can see the northern lights
[00:16:54.040] 当时有消息说北美地区可能出现极光，于是他和朋友们就说，嘿，咱们去爬沙斯塔山看看能不能看到极光吧。
[00:17:05.600] So when he came back, he like showed me the pictures. I was like cool They're like fuck it I'm down Fuck it. We ball But I think he like realized he was like, oh shoot I forgot to tell crystal that time
[00:17:05.600] 所以他回来之后，就给我看了那些照片。我当时就觉得酷。他们好像在说：管他呢，我同意了，管他呢，我们玩得开心。但我觉得他后来意识到，哎呀，我忘了告诉克里斯托那件事了。
[00:17:22.040] I don't know. I think like two weeks later He went on another hiking trip like an overnight camping slash hiking trip So that time he did tell me in advance on Thursday
[00:17:22.040] 我不知道。我想大概两周后，他又去徒步旅行了，像是那种过夜露营/徒步旅行。那次他提前在周四告诉我了。
[00:17:31.720] He was like, oh by the way crystal like me and my friends should be camping this weekend So I'll probably be gone like Friday Saturday. I was like, okay. Thanks for letting me know You're like I approve this PTM
[00:17:31.720] 他当时说，哦对了，Crystal 和我的朋友们这周末要去露营，所以我可能周五周六都不在。我说，好的，谢谢你告诉我。你就像在说，我同意这个家长指导。
[00:17:47.270] Yeah, I'm like how could you just leave me alone with no communication Dude I feel like the communication is so key though. I've definitely had times where my mom was like, whoa How come you're in this city this weekend? Like what are you guys doing?
[00:17:47.270] 是啊，我就想，你怎么能一声不吭就把我一个人丢下？兄弟，我觉得沟通真的太重要了。我妈也经常问我：“哇，你怎么这周末在这儿？你们在干嘛？”
[00:18:01.870] Because I think we were driving down to like mammoth and I forgot to tell her we were going skiing So she saw like our location in the mountains. She's like, are you guys good? Like please tell me you're skiing
[00:18:01.870] 因为我觉得我们当时正开车去猛犸山，我忘了告诉她我们要去滑雪。所以她看到了我们在山上的位置。她就问，你们没事吧？拜托告诉我你们在滑雪。
[00:18:11.630] And then vice versa like sometimes if I see my mom or my dad out late It's hard to not think like the worst like I think especially because I'm a more anxious prone person
[00:18:11.630] 反过来也一样，有时候如果我看到我爸妈很晚还在外面，就很难不往最坏的方面想，尤其是我这种比较容易焦虑的人。
[00:18:20.590] I see their location or I see that they haven't responded and I'm immediately like, okay, they're not okay panic. Yeah But now that you are moved out
[00:18:20.590] 我一看到他们的位置，或者发现他们没有回复，就会立刻慌了，心想：完了，他们出事了。是啊，不过现在你已经搬出去了。
[00:18:29.030] Do you think you'll continue to update your parents on if you're going out on any trips and whatnot, dude? I don't know. I Think yes, if it's like a big trip And then if it's like an overnight trip
[00:18:29.030] 你觉得你以后出门旅行什么的还会跟爸妈说吗？我不知道。我觉得如果是长途旅行的话会说，如果是短途旅行的话也会说。
[00:18:42.790] I think it might depend on where to and like how far and with who I guess You know probably if it's an out-of-state trip, I'll give them a little heads up
[00:18:42.790] 我觉得这可能取决于去哪里、距离远近以及和谁一起去。你知道，如果是跨州旅行，我大概会提前通知他们一下。
[00:18:53.990] but I'm imagining like I don't know if it were you know, like a little day trip to Monterey or like a One night two day trip to like Monterey Maybe not just because that's like, you know relatively small of a trip, right?
[00:18:53.990] 但我想象的是，我不知道这算不算去蒙特雷一日游，或者去蒙特雷住一晚两天？也许不算，因为那算是一次比较短的旅行，对吧？
[00:19:08.150] But yeah, I'm still kind of gauging what to share versus what not to share but I think definitely like international trips is a yes and Flights that are longer than like two hours is probably
[00:19:08.150] 不过，我还在权衡哪些事该分享，哪些事不该分享，但我觉得国际旅行肯定要分享，而飞行时间超过两小时的航班可能就不该分享了。
[00:19:21.070] That's true, like if you're flying out somewhere to a different city that makes sense I guess I'm at the same time also trying to gauge what the correct amount of
[00:19:21.070] 没错，比如如果你要飞到另一个城市，那这么做就说得通了。我想与此同时，我也在试图估算合适的金额是多少。
[00:19:31.390] Just general communication is in the past when I was farther at school college or you know in New York I would try to call my parents maybe every one to two weeks But now it's like we're so close that almost feels excessive, you know
[00:19:31.390] 以前我离家远，比如在学校、大学或者纽约的时候，一般的沟通比较少，我大概每隔一两周会给父母打个电话。但现在我们关系太亲近了，联系频繁到感觉有点过头了，你知道吗？
[00:19:51.270] It's like I guess I could just drive over and talk to you for an hour versus like FaceTime you for an hour So definitely still figuring out that level of communication and I feel like that would also Help establish like how much I'm sharing with them, too
[00:19:51.270] 感觉就像我可以开车过去跟你聊一个小时，而不是跟你视频通话一个小时。所以我还在摸索这种沟通方式，我觉得这样也能帮助确定我跟他们分享了多少。
[00:20:07.830] That's true and that makes me reflect back on My parents like different living locations to and what our system was and I think the further we were It would be phone calls and then the closer we were it would be text messages
[00:20:07.830] 没错，这让我回想起我父母住在不同的地方，以及我们当时的联系方式。我想，我们住得越远，就越倾向于打电话；住得越近，就越倾向于发短信。
[00:20:22.230] Because when you're far like especially when we were doing like me in California and my parents in Korea There's only like a certain window of the day that you can actually communicate So then just talking on the phone really quick
[00:20:22.230] 因为当你身处异地时，尤其是像我这样在加州而我父母在韩国的时候，一天中只有特定的时间段可以真正联系上，所以就只能快速地打电话。
[00:20:33.510] I think would be more efficient versus when you're close like there's way more hours in the day that you can actually be talking and I Like the questions that come up are like smaller questions, too
[00:20:33.510] 我觉得这样效率更高，因为距离近的时候，一天中可以真正用来交谈的时间更多。而且我喜欢提出的问题都是些小问题。
[00:20:43.630] It's like oh, can you tell me how you do this or like, you know? What we get is better for you while like way more coordinating stuff versus when you're far like it's like how have you been?
[00:20:43.630] 就像，哦，你能告诉我你是怎么做到的吗？或者，你知道吗？我们得到的对你来说更好，因为这样可以更好地协调各种事情，而当你离得很远时，就像，你最近怎么样？
[00:20:52.270] You know like deeper conversations maybe or like even the more serious conversations like have to happen with that distance So maybe you can try texting with your parents more that's a good point
[00:20:52.270] 你知道，像那种更深入的对话，或者更严肃的谈话，可能都需要在距离之外进行。所以，或许你可以尝试多和父母发短信，这倒是个好主意。
[00:21:03.750] I did invite my mom over for dinner like the other day and we were just texting like oh What time do you want to come? It's like what what is your schedule work? Wait, also I asked my mom
[00:21:03.750] 前几天我邀请我妈来我家吃晚饭，我们一直在发短信问她什么时候来，她问我她工作时间怎么样。等等，我还问了我妈。
[00:21:14.110] I was like what time do you want to come and she's like depends on your time and I was like How about 630 and she was like, how about six? I Was like, oh, okay six works
[00:21:14.110] 我问她你想几点来，她说看你的时间，我说六点半怎么样，她说六点呢？我说哦，好的，六点可以。
[00:21:33.190] She's like bargaining time with me she made you feel like you had the power But yeah, I think you're right like in those situations it's like quick problem-solving
[00:21:33.190] 她就像在跟我讨价还价，让你觉得自己掌握了主动权。不过，我觉得你说得对，在那种情况下，就像是快速解决问题。
[00:21:45.870] So it's just like sending a text is totally fine or sometimes she'll text and be like, hey you got this letter in the mail I'll put it on your desk. Okay, you left your water bottle here, right?
[00:21:45.870] 所以，发个短信完全没问题，或者有时候她会发短信说：“嘿，你收到一封信了，我把它放在你桌子上。” “对了，你的水瓶落在这里了，对吧？”
[00:21:56.870] What I find really interesting though is I don't know if you've had this experience, but sometimes when you talk to Parents or like friends of your parents or other people's family friends, etc
[00:21:56.870] 不过，我觉得很有意思的是，我不知道你有没有过这种经历，但有时候当你和父母、父母的朋友或者其他人的家庭朋友等等聊天时，会发生一些意想不到的事情。
[00:22:07.950] Like the adults, I feel like they always have commentary about their kids and how often they come home. Oh I've you know heard parents to be like, oh, yeah, like, you know my son or my daughter like they never come home
[00:22:07.950] 我觉得他们跟大人一样，总是对自己的孩子评头论足，说他们多久回家一次。哦，我听过有些父母抱怨说，哎，我儿子或者我女儿好像从来不回家似的。
[00:22:21.190] They never come visit me blah blah or the opposite like oh my son or daughter They're texting me every fucking day Like always asking me how to make one dish or another and I think that also influences how I see Like my relationship with my parents as well
[00:22:21.190] 他们从来不来看我，或者反过来，比如“我的儿子/女儿”，他们每天都给我发短信，总是问我怎么做这道菜，我觉得这也影响了我看待我和父母关系的方式。
[00:22:36.510] Like I'm always like if my parents were to describe their like communication cadence with me How would they say it like would I be the daughter that never comes home or would I be the daughter that like Texts too much during the week
[00:22:36.510] 我总是想，如果我父母要描述他们和我沟通的频率，他们会怎么说呢？我会是那种从不回家的女儿，还是那种一周里发太多短信的女儿？
[00:22:49.910] Whoa, I guess I never thought too much about that The way that I have thought about it is that my parents have never complained about the amount of times I go home So I just assume I'm on a good level right now. I
[00:22:49.910] 哇，我好像从来没仔细想过这个问题。我的想法是，我父母从来没抱怨过我回家的次数，所以我就觉得我现在的情况挺好的。
[00:23:06.470] Did have to have a talk with my mom though because I think for a period of time this year We were like barely communicating and I was like feeling pretty sad about it So the other day I called her and I was like, okay mom
[00:23:06.470] 不过我确实得跟我妈谈谈，因为我觉得今年有一段时间我们几乎没怎么联系，我为此很难过。所以前几天我给她打了个电话，我说，好吧，妈妈。
[00:23:17.710] I think we need to call each other at least once a week Like that's like the bare minimum for me and then she was like, okay, and then she texted me later She was like, yeah so I talked about it with your dad and I
[00:23:17.710] 我觉得我们至少应该每周通一次电话，这对我来说是最低限度。然后她就说，好的。之后她又给我发短信说，嗯，我和你爸爸谈过了，然后……
[00:23:29.430] Had floated the like concept of oh How come GC wants to talk on the phone so much or like what do we even have to like talk about on the phone? Oh my god, and your dad gave me like an earful. Like he was scolding me
[00:23:29.430] 我之前提过类似“GC为什么那么爱打电话”或者“我们打电话到底有什么好聊的？”之类的问题，结果你爸狠狠地训了我一顿，好像在训斥我似的。
[00:23:41.570] So I repent and I'm sorry like we should talk Wait, that's so funny. It's another role reversal where you're like, um, we need to you need to be calling me like That's like literally what my mom said to me when I like when we first went to college
[00:23:41.570] 所以我忏悔，我很抱歉，我们应该谈谈。等等，这太搞笑了。这又是角色互换，你会说，嗯，我们需要，你需要给我打电话。这简直就像我妈在我刚上大学时跟我说的话。
[00:23:59.230] She's like crystal make sure to call me like at least once one or two weeks Dude, yeah Cuz my mom is very much the type of person or like the type of mom who she's like I don't want to bother you like you live your own life
[00:23:59.230] 她就像克丽丝塔尔一样，确保至少每隔一两周给我打一次电话。哥们儿，是啊，因为我妈就是那种人，或者说那种妈妈，她会说“我不想打扰你，你过你自己的生活吧”。
[00:24:12.270] Like I'm hands-off if you need me I'm here like and I'll always pick up but I'm not gonna force you on some sort of cadence But unluckily for her I am the type of daughter where I'm like, I need a cadence and I need to talk to you
[00:24:12.270] 就像我不会干涉你，如果你需要我，我随时都在，我总会接电话，但我不会强迫你按照某种节奏来。但对她来说不幸的是，我就是那种女儿，我需要节奏，我需要跟你说话。
[00:24:25.790] Yeah Wait, I feel like that's so funny that your mom was like, what are we even gonna talk about? She was like, yeah, I told my best friend too and she got really mad It's so funny too because my mom is very good about calling like my grandma
[00:24:25.790] 是啊，等等，我觉得你妈当时说“我们到底要聊什么啊？”真是太搞笑了。她说，是啊，我也跟我最好的朋友说了，她特别生气。还有，我妈也特别爱打电话，就像我奶奶一样，这也太搞笑了。
[00:24:47.150] Oh my god, like she'll call my grandma once a week and I'm like, well, what do you guys talk about? She's like, oh I already talked it all through with your grandma so I
[00:24:47.150] 我的天哪，她每周都会给我奶奶打一次电话，我就问她，你们都聊些什么呢？她说，哦，我已经跟你奶奶都聊过了，所以我……
[00:25:02.550] Guess she is also thinking about herself. She's like, oh I need to be entertaining for Jisoo But you're like you're like don't worry. I already have so many topics for us to talk Like here's the tea that your weekly digest I
[00:25:02.550] 看来她也在考虑自己。她可能在想，哦，我得逗Jisoo开心才行。但你却说，别担心，我已经有很多话题可以跟你聊了，比如，这是你每周必看的八卦。
[00:25:20.110] Don't know I've kind of been thinking about it because There's only so many updates that I have on the weekly like there are some weeks where my life is maybe more exciting or more dynamic and then other weeks where it's like a
[00:25:20.110] 不知道，我一直在想这个问题，因为我每周能更新的内容就那么多，有些周我的生活可能更精彩、更丰富多彩，而有些周则可能比较平淡。
[00:25:31.350] Maintenance week or like a routine week like here the things that I did are very mundane and normal, so I was kind of like Should I think of new things that we could do together? You know how like people in long-distance relationships
[00:25:31.350] 维护周或者说像例行周一样，我做的事情都很平淡无奇，所以我就在想，要不要想想我们可以一起做些什么新鲜事呢？你知道那种异地恋的感觉。
[00:25:44.270] So maybe pick up like a video game together or they'll like watch a movie together So I'm like should I be doing that with my mom? Oh That's so funny
[00:25:44.270] 所以她们可能会一起玩电子游戏，或者一起看电影。我就想，我应该和我妈妈一起做这些吗？哦，这太搞笑了。
[00:25:53.470] But I feel like a show could be a good one like you watch it on your own time and then you like discuss it In the phone call like oh my god. Did you watch the newest episode? That's true
[00:25:53.470] 但我感觉那种可以自己找时间看，然后打电话讨论的节目挺好的，比如“我的天哪，你看了最新一集吗？”确实如此。
[00:26:02.990] so I did start watching the lovely runner because my mom was like This is so good, and I refuse to watch your dating reality TV shows like fine. I'll watch your drama But
[00:26:02.990] 所以我开始看《可爱的跑者》，因为我妈说这节目太好看了，而我拒绝看你们的约会真人秀，好吧，那我看你们的狗血剧就行了。
[00:26:13.550] Honestly, I was like talking to a friend recently and she has been playing a lot of Stardew Valley co-op with her boyfriend And I was like, whoa, my mom loves Stardew Valley and I'm also us Yeah
[00:26:13.550] 说实话，我最近和一个朋友聊天，她和她男朋友一直在玩《星露谷物语》的合作模式。我就想，哇，我妈也超爱玩《星露谷物语》，我也一样。
[00:26:24.710] My mom used to I got her on it during COVID and she was at one point playing on her phone I had and her MacBook like three different ways. She's a gamer Yeah
[00:26:24.710] 我妈以前玩，疫情期间我让她也玩，她一度同时用我的手机和她的MacBook玩，用了三种不同的方式。她是个游戏迷。
[00:26:35.950] And I was like should me and my mom play Stardew Valley co-op. Oh my god. Wait, that would be so funny She could show you around her farm Yeah. Yeah, dude. Imagine I'm like mom get on discord. She's like, okay Wait, that's wholesome as hell. I
[00:26:35.950] 然后我就想，要不要和我妈一起玩星露谷物语合作模式？我的天哪。等等，那也太搞笑了。她可以带你参观她的农场。对啊，兄弟。想象一下，我跟她说：“妈，上Discord吧。”她回答：“好的。”等等，这也太温馨了吧。
[00:26:53.470] Don't know I think like this is also a not just a long-distance thing But even when you live close by to your parents Do you ever think of activities that you want to do with them when you go back and visit or even when you were just spending
[00:26:53.470] 我不知道，我觉得这不仅仅是异地恋的问题，即使你和父母住得很近，你有没有想过回去探望他们的时候，或者只是和他们一起度过时光的时候，想和他们一起做些什么？
[00:27:06.430] Time together when you were at home To be honest, not really the most is maybe like meals to eat like oh my Parents would totally enjoy if we ate hot pot maybe yeah, or like I would enjoy this meal and my parents need to tag Or
[00:27:06.430] 在家的时候一起度过的时光。说实话，其实不是最重要的，可能就是一起吃饭，比如“哦，我爸妈肯定会喜欢我们吃火锅的”，或者“我喜欢这顿饭，我爸妈需要点赞”。
[00:27:28.710] Sometimes it's like oh I heard this restaurants really good I should probably take my parents to it or sometimes it's like oh Maybe I can make like cook this meal for my parents. So it's very food centered
[00:27:28.710] 有时候我会想，哦，我听说这家餐厅很不错，我应该带父母去试试；有时候我会想，哦，也许我可以给父母做顿饭。所以，我的生活方式非常注重食物。
[00:27:39.630] For me. Yeah, I think like all most of the activities I think of are like very food centered hmm I mean actually that makes a lot of sense because that's how I think food is often a currency or like token of love in Asian households
[00:27:39.630] 对我来说。是啊，我觉得我能想到的绝大多数活动都和食物有关。嗯，其实这很有道理，因为我觉得在亚洲家庭里，食物常常是一种货币，或者说是爱的象征。
[00:27:53.030] I'm just like an unspoken way to like enjoy each other's company and whatnot I know when we go to visit James's mom Sometimes we'll bring our little like Korean barbecue grill that home plug-in one
[00:27:53.030] 我觉得我们之间有一种无需言语的相处方式，比如享受彼此的陪伴等等。我知道我们去拜访詹姆斯的妈妈时，有时会带上我们的小型韩式烤肉架，就是那种家用插电式的。
[00:28:04.510] Yeah, and then we'll find different things to grow and do like a KBBQ night in or something like that So I think those are very special memories, too. Yeah, that's super nice Sometimes it's also like simple things like sometimes I tag along with my mom to Costco
[00:28:04.510] 是啊，然后我们还会尝试一些不同的事情来培养感情，比如在家做韩式烤肉之类的。所以我觉得这些也是非常特别的回忆。嗯，那太好了。有时候也像一些简单的小事，比如有时候我会陪妈妈去Costco。
[00:28:20.630] And I feel like that makes her very happy because I would say on average she probably ends up going to Costco alone Sometimes my dad joins her but sometimes she's going on the weekdays
[00:28:20.630] 我觉得这让她很开心，因为平均来说她可能都是一个人去Costco。有时候我爸爸会陪她，但有时候她会在工作日去。
[00:28:31.750] So, you know like we're at work and she's she's like, okay quick before Costco gets too crowded Let me like, you know And so I think there's definitely been some times where I tag along with her and I can tell that she's like
[00:28:31.750] 所以，你知道，就像我们在上班的时候，她会说，好了，快点，趁Costco还没太拥挤，让我进去逛逛。所以我觉得肯定有几次我跟着她一起去，我能感觉到她……
[00:28:44.590] Excited that I'm there because she'll be like, oh, is there anything you want? Like, you know throw it in the throw it in the cart if you want it and I made her buy me like hella socks But like 20 pack of stuff they sell at Costco
[00:28:44.590] 我很高兴我在那里，因为她会问：“哦，你想要什么吗？” 就像，你知道的，想要什么就放进购物车里。结果我让她给我买了一大堆袜子，就是那种在Costco卖的20双装的袜子。
[00:29:00.470] And I think it's so cute too because like I think you've mentioned your mom does something similar along these lines We're like if my mom's out at Costco or shopping sometimes she sees something and she'll take a photo of it and send it to me and be like
[00:29:00.470] 我觉得这也太可爱了，因为就像你之前提到的，你妈妈也会做类似的事情。比如，我妈妈去Costco或者其他购物的时候，有时候她看到什么东西，就会拍张照片发给我，然后说：
[00:29:12.270] Oh, do you need this? Like do you want this? And I'm like, oh, don't worry mom Like I'm good but I'm always like all that's so nice that she's like, you know still thinking about me and
[00:29:12.270] 哦，你需要这个吗？你是说你想要这个吗？然后我就说，哦，别担心，妈妈，我很好。但我总是觉得，她一直想着我，这感觉真好。
[00:29:20.430] Yeah, like clearly like oh my god does Crystal need this now that she's like, you know out on her own Do I know even when I go visit my parents in Texas the first day that I go
[00:29:20.430] 是啊，很明显，天哪，克丽丝塔尔现在太需要这个了，她现在一个人生活，你知道的。我甚至知道，即使我去德州看望父母的第一天，她也需要这个。
[00:29:32.190] I always like come with some sort of gift or whatever and then my mom will go into her magic closet and come out with Like oh, I bought this like golf dress
[00:29:32.190] 我总是喜欢带点礼物什么的，然后我妈就会走进她的魔法衣橱，拿出来，比如“哦，我买了件高尔夫球裙”。
[00:29:39.630] Do you want it or like I bought these socks because I thought of you and it's like it's like the cutest thing Dude, yeah And I feel like there's almost times where I have to reel them in
[00:29:39.630] 你想要吗？还是说我买这双袜子是因为想到了你，而且它真的太可爱了？兄弟，是啊。我觉得有时候我都快要忍不住想把它们拉回来了。
[00:29:48.710] You know where I'm like, don't worry about it. Like you don't need to spend all this money on me. I'm good and It's once again kind of that role reversal we've talked about
[00:29:48.710] 你知道我的意思，就像是说，别担心。就像你不需要在我身上花这么多钱。我很好。这又一次体现了我们之前讨论过的那种角色互换。
[00:29:58.310] So I feel like another thing is the older we get and like the more independent we get the more Roles of responsibility we take on even if we're not, you know living in the same household as our parents anymore so I guess like one example is
[00:29:58.310] 所以我觉得还有一点，就是我们年纪越大，越独立，即使不再和父母住在一起，也要承担更多的责任。举个例子来说……
[00:30:14.750] Kind of like I mentioned how I'm constantly thinking about like food centric activities But I will try to maybe like step up and take charge of that So like oh guys I found this restaurant let's go eat here on Friday
[00:30:14.750] 就像我之前提到的，我总是想着跟吃有关的事情，但我会努力行动起来，主动安排。比如，嘿，伙计们，我找到一家餐厅，我们周五去那儿吃吧。
[00:30:29.470] So kind of like, you know taking that leadership role to get an event to happen Do you find yourself taking on more of these like roles of responsibility as well?
[00:30:29.470] 所以，你知道，扮演领导角色来促成某项活动，你是否也发现自己承担了更多类似的责任角色？
[00:30:39.550] I think a little bit and probably when I feel it the most is when my parents come to visit me and they're staying at Like our house. I'm kind of like whoa because I'm so used to staying at my parents house and they're like the
[00:30:39.550] 我觉得有点儿，可能最明显的时候就是我父母来我家住的时候。我当时会有点儿不适应，因为我太习惯住在父母家了，他们就像……
[00:30:52.110] Controllers of the house early, you know Like they're like the people who know the house the best and like they like my mom's kitchen is organized how she wants it And etc, etc When my parents come to our place
[00:30:52.110] 你知道，家里的“掌控者”很早就开始管事了，就像他们最了解房子一样，比如他们喜欢我妈妈的厨房按照她喜欢的方式布置等等。当我的父母来我们家的时候……
[00:31:02.270] Any questions that they have about the house or whatnot like they would direct that to myself and James right or like even the kitchen It's like organized just the way I like it in the way that it's useful and convenient for me to cook
[00:31:02.270] 他们对房子或其他方面有任何疑问，都会直接问我和詹姆斯，对吧？就连厨房也是，它的布置正合我意，既实用又方便我做饭。
[00:31:14.190] That always makes me feel a little bit weird where I'm like, whoa they're like in my space and to be honest sometimes it's The gap between what I'm used to and the gap between what I'm experiencing at the moment makes it almost uncomfortable
[00:31:14.190] 这总是让我感觉有点怪怪的，就像，哇，他们好像闯入了我的私人空间。说实话，有时候，我习惯的和我现在经历的之间的落差，会让我感到很不舒服。
[00:31:27.950] Where I'm kind of like not used to the situation. So then it brings up like weird energy sometimes I see so that I remember when my parents first came and visited
[00:31:27.950] 我有点不习惯这种情况。所以有时候会感觉到一种奇怪的氛围，让我想起父母第一次来探望我的情景。
[00:31:36.950] I would get kind of snippy and stuff because they were in my space and it was like really weird And I think I just didn't have the maturity to like be able to handle that situation
[00:31:36.950] 因为他们占用了我的空间，我觉得很奇怪，所以我会变得有点暴躁。我想我当时还不够成熟，无法处理这种情况。
[00:31:47.030] Hopefully now I kind of do but I just remember thinking like wow, this is a little bit odd. Mm-hmm Wait, I think I totally get what you mean. You're like not used to having them there
[00:31:47.030] 希望我现在能有点儿适应了，但我当时就觉得，哇，这有点儿奇怪。嗯……等等，我想我完全明白你的意思了。你好像还不习惯它们在那里。
[00:31:56.790] Yeah, so sometimes you like act out in ways you didn't even need to Exactly. Like I remember one of the things we fought about was I mean first of all, it's like when parents come over
[00:31:56.790] 是啊，有时候你会做出一些完全没必要做的事情。没错。比如我记得我们吵架的其中一件事就是，首先，就是当父母来家里的时候。
[00:32:07.510] I feel like what they do is like they clean your space and I was like, okay mom Like you're here to relax like I don't want you to think that you have to clean this whole time Like just sit there and relax, please
[00:32:07.510] 我觉得他们就像是在帮你打扫房间，我就想，妈，你来这里是为了放松，我不想让你觉得你得一直打扫卫生，你就坐在那儿放松一下吧，拜托了。
[00:32:18.510] Yeah, and then I think the other instinct is like, oh my god Like, you know, I have all this stuff at my house But Jesus doesn't have it here
[00:32:18.510] 是啊，然后我觉得另一种本能反应就是，我的天哪，你知道，我家里有这些东西，但耶稣这里却没有。
[00:32:26.110] like you totally need this whole sewing kit and like, you know, I'll buy it and like stock up your so I'm like Don't be like you don't need to buy these things Like we don't have that much space like just just don't buy these things Yeah
[00:32:26.110] 就好像你真的需要这整套缝纫工具似的，你知道，我会买下来帮你囤货，所以我就说，别说你不需要买这些东西，我们家空间不大，就别买这些东西了，是啊。
[00:32:38.790] So I think that is definitely a responsibility too, right? like being the keeper of your space sort of and then learning to Fit your parents into that routine when they visit and I'm sure maybe on your parents and to they're feeling a little awkward
[00:32:38.790] 所以我觉得这肯定也是一种责任，对吧？就像是守护好自己的空间，然后学会让父母在来访时融入你的日常生活。我肯定，父母可能会觉得有点尴尬。
[00:32:52.590] Like what do I do with my hands? Like what can I touch and what can I not touch I Also had an experience where my mom was like visiting me in my space and I was like this is kind of weird
[00:32:52.590] 我该把手放在哪里？我能碰什么，不能碰什么？我还经历过一次，我妈妈好像来我的私人空间探望我，我觉得这有点奇怪。
[00:33:07.350] and it was like back in New York and she was like Oh I'm gonna come to New York for like a few days and she told me kind of late because it was a bit of a last Minute decision and I was like, oh my god
[00:33:07.350] 就像回到纽约的时候，她突然说：“哦，我要来纽约待几天。” 她告诉我得有点晚，因为这算是临时决定，我当时就想，我的天哪
[00:33:18.790] I mean, yes, you can come but I'm also like oh shoot. I have like I'm actually busy on this one day I guess I didn't I didn't feel as prepared and so when my mom came she was like, yeah
[00:33:18.790] 我的意思是，是的，你可以来，但我当时也想，哎呀，我那天其实挺忙的，我猜我没做好准备，所以当我妈妈来的时候，她就说，嗯。
[00:33:29.190] I'll just like stay at your apartment and I was like my tiny New York apartment So I was like, okay mom like you need to sleep on the bed. I'll sleep on the couch
[00:33:29.190] 我打算就住在你公寓里，我当时在纽约的公寓很小。所以我就说，好吧，妈妈，你睡床，我睡沙发。
[00:33:39.710] You know all this stuff and she was like dude, don't worry like I can sleep on the couch and I was like no Like stop saying that go sleep on the bed. I Think at one point I was kind of like dang like you came out like a
[00:33:39.710] 你知道这些事，她就说，别担心，我可以睡沙发，我说不行，别这么说，去睡床。我觉得我当时有点儿……哎，你说话的口气就像……
[00:33:55.510] Unfortunate time because I'm busy like I can't be with you like this whole time and she's like dude It's not that big of a deal. Like I could just go explore by myself
[00:33:55.510] 时机真不巧，因为我太忙了，没办法一直陪着你，她却说，哎，没那么严重。好像我可以自己去探险似的。
[00:34:04.830] Like don't worry about it. And also like your uncle and cousin are here and I'll go hang out with them and I was like Okay, fine, but like blah blah and she's like, all right, you need to calm down like She was like, okay
[00:34:04.830] 别担心。还有，你叔叔和表哥在这儿，我去跟他们玩玩，我就说，好吧，行，但是……她就说，好了，你需要冷静下来，然后她说，好吧
[00:34:17.550] I can see that you're a little stressed because you wanted me to visit at like the perfect time where you have like all the amenities for me but like you don't Need a stress like it's fine. I can sleep on the couch if you
[00:34:17.550] 我知道你有点紧张，因为你希望我来的时候一切都安排妥当，设施也都齐全，但你没必要给自己添麻烦，没关系。如果你愿意，我可以睡沙发。
[00:34:29.550] You know, I was like no stop you're definitely sleeping on the bed But yes What you said is correct and I feel like that is just another like taking on responsibility where you're like, oh my god
[00:34:29.550] 你知道，我当时就想，不行，你肯定得睡在床上。但是你说的没错，我觉得这就像是承担责任，就像你会说，我的天哪
[00:34:39.510] I need everything to be like perfect for my parents because they've always been like trying to make things Perfect or like really suited to me I know it's like one of those things that I think causes a lot of friction too because it's not quite the perfect
[00:34:39.510] 我需要一切都完美无缺，才能让父母满意，因为他们总是想把事情做得尽善尽美，或者说非常符合我的心意。我知道这很容易引发摩擦，因为事情往往并不尽如人意。
[00:34:55.430] Reversal where it's not like suddenly our parents are children and we're the parents but it almost feels like we should be able to take on that responsibilities
[00:34:55.430] 角色互换，并非突然间父母变成了孩子，我们变成了父母，而是感觉我们应该能够承担起这些责任。
[00:35:03.350] So I think it almost feels like when we're not fully able to commit to that swap because of one reason or another We just feel bad We're like this is not the way that I wanted it to because you know
[00:35:03.350] 所以我觉得，当我们因为这样那样的原因无法完全接受这种交换时，我们就会感到难过，我们会想，这不是我想要的方式，因为你知道……
[00:35:12.750] I think similar to how you probably felt I was also like oh I don't want my house to be a space where my mom feels obligated to do these things or she feels
[00:35:12.750] 我觉得我的感受可能跟你差不多，我也想过，我不想让我的家变成一个让我妈妈觉得有义务做这些事的地方，或者让她觉得……
[00:35:21.950] Obligated to like fill these voids like I want her to come and be perfectly relaxed and like Perfectly enjoy and be pampered and leave but it's not always quite like that. The pampered part is so
[00:35:21.950] 我有义务填补这些空白，就像我希望她来的时候能完全放松，完全享受，被宠爱，然后离开一样，但事情并不总是如此。被宠爱的部分……
[00:35:34.550] Key as well. You're like you need to just relax. I will cook all the meals, you know I'll do all the housework that you usually do right? But then I guess like maybe it's just so deeply ingrained in them
[00:35:34.550] 关键也是。你会说你需要放松。我会做所有的饭菜，你知道我会做所有你平时做的家务，对吧？但我想，也许这已经深深地根植于他们的观念里了。
[00:35:46.110] They're like no I can help you like it's not a big deal and you're like no sit back down. Yeah Like mom get away from the kitchen like put the cutting board Stop opening the fridge Well, honestly
[00:35:46.110] 他们会说“不，我可以帮你”，好像这没什么大不了的，然后你会说“不，坐下”。是啊，就像妈妈，离开厨房，把砧板放好，别再打开冰箱了。好吧，说真的。
[00:36:02.430] I feel like this episode was so wholesome and it really makes me look back on Even some of these funny moments with our parents where we might have felt frustrated or you know feeling weird in our transition from being that baby of the family to being a
[00:36:02.430] 我觉得这一集特别温馨，让我回想起小时候和父母相处的一些搞笑时刻，那时我们可能也会感到沮丧，或者觉得从家里最小的孩子变成大孩子有点不适应。
[00:36:16.710] slightly older member of the family Like capturing more responsibility and Also like taking charge of you know These lines of communication as we mentioned and making more decisions, you know when to visit our parents. It's so interesting
[00:36:16.710] 家里年纪稍长的成员喜欢承担更多责任，也喜欢掌控沟通渠道，就像我们之前提到的那样，并且喜欢做更多决定，比如什么时候去看望父母。这真有趣。
[00:36:34.070] we have like so much more power now, and I feel like it's definitely a long Period of transition that we go through and find the like right balance So it's very interesting to chat about it since we're both kind of in the middle of it
[00:36:34.070] 我们现在拥有了更大的权力，我觉得这绝对是一个漫长的过渡期，我们需要经历这个过程，找到合适的平衡点。所以我们俩都处于这个过渡期，所以聊这个话题很有意思。
[00:36:48.670] But you're maybe a little further along in your journey, and I'm still a little early on in my journey of that balance so thanks so much for chatting today about our increased responsibilities Within the family and for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts about these
[00:36:48.670] 但你可能在这条路上走得更远一些，而我还在寻求平衡的道路上摸索前行，所以非常感谢你今天和我聊聊我们在家庭中日益增长的责任。也想听听我们听众朋友们对此的看法。
