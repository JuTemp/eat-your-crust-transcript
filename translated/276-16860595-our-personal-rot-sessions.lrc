[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。
[00:00:16.330] So the topic today is very near and dear to my heart. And I also feel like it's particularly relevant for like a cold winter day in February or March. And we are going to talk about our rot routine today. To specify, what is a rot routine to you, Crystal?
[00:00:16.330] 所以，今天的话题对我来说意义非凡。而且我觉得在二三月份寒冷的冬日里，这个话题尤其应景。今天我们要聊聊我们的日常护理流程。具体来说，Crystal，对你来说，日常护理流程是什么样的呢？
[00:00:36.030] Wait, I'm going to be honest. I don't know if there's a routine to it for me personally. If it's the weekend, it's like directly connected to just getting out of bed. But I guess there's like a slight routine if it's on a weekday coming back from work, getting comfy to like sit on the couch or be somewhere and mindlessly do something to recover.
[00:00:36.030] 等等，我得坦白说，我个人并没有什么固定的习惯。如果是周末，那感觉就像是起床后就直接进入状态了。但如果是工作日，下班回家后，我会找个舒服的地方，比如沙发上或者其他什么地方，漫无目的地做点什么来放松一下，大概会有一些固定的流程。
[00:01:04.410] Dang, I feel like for me, I have some prerequisites for what makes a good rot session. Wait, let's hear them. Okay, one thing is, you know how you talked about like getting home from work, settling up on the couch? To me, that's not a full rot routine. I'm just unwinding. You know, I'm like, I deserve this.
[00:01:04.410] 哎，我觉得对我来说，一次完美的放松体验还是有一些前提条件的。等等，让我说说吧。好吧，首先，你知道你之前说过下班回家，瘫在沙发上吗？对我来说，那不算完整的放松流程。那只是在放松而已。你知道，我当时就想，我值得好好放松一下。
[00:01:23.730] A good rot routine for me is chores are done. I have a good chunk of time. I'm talking like at least eight hours probably to like really sit there and rot. And I don't have to do anything after. So for example, if I had brunch plans with the girls, and then later in the evening, I have like post dinner plans, but I have all day to like hang out.
[00:01:23.730] 对我来说，理想的放松方式是：家务做完后，我有大块时间，大概至少八个小时，可以真正地放松休息。之后什么都不用做。比如，如果我和闺蜜们约了早午餐，晚上还有饭后活动，但我一整天都可以自由自在地待着。
[00:01:48.770] To me, that's not a good rot day. Because I still have to get up and do shit later. Yeah, rot day to me is like, say I'm done with all my stuff at 12. And then I finished doing all my chores at three. And then I have that three to midnight time block. Like that's a good rot day. Okay, then what constitutes rotting? What do you do when you rot?
[00:01:48.770] 对我来说，那不算是理想的“放空日”。因为我之后还得起来做事。嗯，我理想中的“放空日”是这样的：比如说，我中午12点把所有事情都做完了，然后下午3点把所有家务都做完了，之后下午3点到午夜这段时间就完全没事可做了。这才算是理想的“放空日”。好吧，那么，什么才算“放空”呢？放空的时候你会做什么？
[00:02:12.170] Well, first of all, I cannot do anything productive. And it's intentional, right? It's not one of those things where I'm like, oh, man, I was so lazy yesterday. I should have done this like a good rot day is okay. Today I'm gonna rot. Don't ask me to do anything.
[00:02:12.170] 首先，我什么正事都做不了。而且这是故意的，对吧？不是那种“哎呀，我昨天太懒了，我应该好好休息一天”的情况。今天我就打算好好休息，别指望我做任何事。
[00:02:30.010] And I feel like it requires a couple of things. And I feel like one of the most important prerequisites to is like, I need the house to be clean. So that way, I'm not rotting and also being like, damn, I really should be doing this one thing. I deserve this. It should be like guilt free. Yes, exactly. Like visually guilt free to Interesting. I was surprised to hear that you need eight hours to consider it to truly be rotting.
[00:02:30.010] 我觉得这需要几个条件。我觉得最重要的前提条件之一就是，房子必须干净。这样我才不会腐烂，也不会觉得，哎，我真的应该做这件事。我应该得到这样的奖励。这应该是一种毫无愧疚感的体验。没错，就是这样。视觉上应该毫无愧疚感。有意思。我很惊讶地听说，你需要八个小时才能认为它真的腐烂了。
[00:02:59.750] Yeah, I immediately started calculating in my head. Say we get back from work and you're back home by like, maybe five 530, maybe six if there was a lot of traffic, then you don't have the full eight hours.
[00:02:59.750] 是的，我立刻开始在脑子里计算。假设我们下班回家，你大概五点半到家，如果路上堵车可能要到六点，那你就没有满八个小时了。
[00:03:13.970] That is true. But I think it's because after work, there's still a lot of stuff you have to do, right? Like for me, when I get back, I come home, I cook, we clean the kitchen, and then I'll like do some general tidying. There's probably like day to day things that I have to keep up with like my personal email or like, personal obligations. I shower, pack my bag, lay down. Even if I do it fast, I feel like that's already 830.
[00:03:13.970] 确实如此。但我觉得是因为下班后还有很多事情要做，对吧？比如我，下班回家后，做饭，打扫厨房，然后做一些简单的整理。可能还有一些日常琐事要处理，比如回复私人邮件或者其他个人事务。我洗澡、收拾行李、睡觉。即使我动作很快，感觉也已经八点半了。
[00:03:40.930] Dang. Wait, okay, what about this? Let's say you did all the chores the day before. So the only real task left to do after you come back from work this one day is to like have a dinner. So let's say you came back and immediately just went to the couch to rot, but you had to get up to make food. Does that ruin the rot cycle? Yeah, 100%. But what if it was like girl dinner? Like you got up and you just microwaved something.
[00:03:40.930] 哎呀。等等，好吧，那这样呢？假设你前一天把家务都做完了。所以这天你下班回家后唯一要做的事就是吃晚饭。假设你回家后直接瘫在沙发上，但你不得不起来做饭。这会打破你“瘫倒”的循环吗？当然会，百分之百会。但如果是那种女生晚餐呢？比如你起来随便用微波炉加热了点东西。
[00:04:12.350] Oh, oh my god, wait, even better. You had leftovers from the previous day that just needed to be microwaved. I mean, I think there are times where I'll like get back from work early and it's a chill day the next day and there's not a ton that I have to do that day where I am kind of like, oh, this was like a pretty good chill day. But for some reason, it doesn't feel like a rot day to me. A rot day is like a setup. It's like a mindset. It's a mentality.
[00:04:12.350] 哦，我的天，等等，还有更好的。你还有前一天的剩菜，只需要微波炉加热一下就行了。我的意思是，有时候我会提前下班，第二天很轻松，没什么事要做，然后我就会觉得，哦，今天真是个不错的放松日。但不知为何，我感觉不到这是糟糕的一天。糟糕的一天就像一种预设，一种心态，一种思维方式。
[00:04:43.110] Okay, wait, I have another question then. Okay. So can rotting happen on Sundays? Oh, that's a great question. And the answer is no. Okay, I figured it out. Yeah. Unless the only exception is if I truly have nothing to do all day. And then the groceries have already been purchased. And then I have like a good 10am to like 6pm block and I'm done rotting by 6pm.
[00:04:43.110] 好吧，等等，我还有个问题。好吧。那么，星期天也能腐烂吗？哦，问得好。答案是不能。好吧，我明白了。是啊。除非我一整天真的无所事事。而且食材也已经买好了。然后我就有大约从早上10点到下午6点的空闲时间，到下午6点我就腐烂完毕了。
[00:05:11.490] Okay, I see what the thing is now. If you have like a big responsibility the following day, you can't rot. Yes, yes, exactly. So Sunday doesn't really work because you have work on one day. But if it was a long weekend, maybe.
[00:05:11.490] 好吧，我现在明白了。如果你第二天有很重要的责任，就不能懈怠。对，对，没错。所以星期天不太合适，因为你第二天还要工作。但如果是长周末的话，也许可以。
[00:05:28.370] Yeah. So you bring up a great point. Long weekends are perfect timeframes to truly rot. And Friday nights, on the chance that you have no plans, maybe you're like a so is out doing stuff with his friends. That is like a really prime rot day. Because you still have Saturday to do all your shit, right?
[00:05:28.370] 是啊，你说的很有道理。长周末简直是彻底放纵自己的完美时机。周五晚上，万一你没什么安排，比如你男朋友和朋友出去玩了，那简直就是放纵的最佳时机。因为你还有周六可以做其他事，对吧？
[00:05:50.950] Yeah. Hopefully you got off early on Friday. So Friday is like probably the only week day where I would qualify it as like a perfect rot candidate. Interesting. So I feel like I've never really put a time limit on what I consider rotting. So I can rot any day. Oh, you're like free form.
[00:05:50.950] 是啊。希望你周五早点下班。周五大概是我唯一觉得适合“腐烂”的星期几了。有意思。感觉我好像从来没给“腐烂”设过时间限制。所以，我哪天都可以“腐烂”。哦，你真是随性自在啊。
[00:06:15.550] Yeah. I mean, there has to be like a minimum timeframe, I'm assuming, even if there's not like a high minimum. So what would you say is like your base? Probably three to four hours minimum. Yeah. Okay. Maybe if I were to just rot on the couch and watch like, oh, you know what, maybe it does have to be a little longer, maybe like four minimum. Okay.
[00:06:15.550] 是啊。我的意思是，肯定得有个最低时长限制吧，就算没有特别高的最低要求。那你觉得最基本的时长是多少？大概至少三四个小时吧。嗯。好的。如果我只是瘫在沙发上看剧的话，嗯，你知道吗，可能确实得再长一点，至少四个小时。好的。
[00:06:39.970] If I sit on the couch and can watch enough content that it feels like I binged a show or like maybe watched two movies consecutively, then it starts to really feel like, oh, nice. Like I rotted. Oh, okay. I can understand that for sure. Yeah. Do you prefer to rot by yourself? Or do you also sometimes enjoy rotting with someone else? Oh my god. Wait, I never even considered rotting with someone else.
[00:06:39.970] 如果我坐在沙发上，看了足够多的内容，感觉就像一口气追完了一整季剧，或者连着看了两部电影，那感觉真的会很棒。就像我腐烂了一样。哦，好吧。我完全能理解。是啊。你喜欢一个人腐烂吗？还是有时候也喜欢和别人一起腐烂？我的天哪。等等，我从来没想过和别人一起腐烂。
[00:07:11.630] Oh my god. Wait, when you started saying that question, I was like, huh? You're like, what do you mean? Someone else can be here too? Okay, I think there's two aspects to this. One is that I don't live with my boyfriend right now. So I feel like there's not really a true opportunity to like both really just rot. Yeah. We try to hang out if we're together. Yeah, I don't know.
[00:07:11.630] 我的天哪。等等，你刚问这个问题的时候，我一脸懵，什么意思？其他人也可以在这里吗？好吧，我觉得这事儿有两个方面。一是我现在没跟男朋友住在一起。所以我觉得我们俩其实没机会真正地待在一起。是啊。如果我们在一起的话，我们会尽量一起出去玩。嗯，我也不知道。
[00:07:40.630] Can you hang out while rotting? But I think the other thing is maybe if someone is semi-rotting, then the other person has to pick up the responsibilities if there are some. That is true. So it's harder. And I feel like everyone has a slightly different definition of rotting slash different things that they want to do when they rot. So if that doesn't align, then it might be hard.
[00:07:40.630] 腐烂的时候还能出去玩吗？不过我觉得还有一点，如果有人已经半腐烂了，那其他人就得承担起一些责任。确实如此。所以情况会更糟。而且我觉得每个人对腐烂的定义都略有不同，他们想在腐烂的时候做的事情也不一样。所以如果这些定义不一致，那就可能很难办了。
[00:08:35.750] Yeah. Food items for me are like girl dinner or delivery food. Oh, smart. Like those are the only two options. I'll make one exception for frozen pizza. Oh yeah, okay. One, I don't want to be cooking and cleaning while I'm rotting. It's not truly a rot sesh. And even if you were to say like, oh, why don't you just cook a nice meal for yourself and then like do the dishes later? You know, that already breaks the like impending chore thing. Yeah.
[00:08:35.750] 是啊。对我来说，食物要么是女生晚餐，要么是外卖。哦，真聪明。好像只有这两种选择似的。冷冻披萨我勉强算一个例外。哦，好吧。首先，我可不想一边腐烂一边做饭洗碗。那根本算不上真正的腐烂。就算你说，哦，你为什么不给自己做顿好吃的，然后晚点再洗碗呢？你知道，那样就等于打破了“即将要做家务”的假象。是啊。
[00:09:03.890] And two, to me, rotting like a good rot is about indulgence. It's like treating yourself. It's like letting yourself do what you want to do for a period of time. That's allotted to you. I cook pretty regularly on like a daily basis. So then I want to be absolved of that from time to time. And for me, a lot of the times when I rot, it is by myself. I'm not going to do like a whole thing just for me to eat. You know, like, yeah, that's a lot of work. Yeah. Dang.
[00:09:03.890] 第二，对我来说，像个好人一样“腐烂”是一种放纵。就像犒劳自己，就像在一段时间内让自己做任何想做的事。这是属于你的时间。我几乎每天都做饭，所以偶尔也想摆脱这种负担。而且对我来说，很多时候我“腐烂”的时候都是一个人。我不会为了自己吃而特意去做一大堆事。你知道，那太费劲了。哎。
[00:09:33.870] I didn't even think about takeout, but you're right. That's the perfect rot food because you don't have to lift a finger and then everything can go straight into the trash after. Yes, exactly. Exactly. Not a single utensil needs to be washed. Maybe like one cup. But I think for me, I'm always thinking of a meal because my rot sessions are, I don't know, six to eight hours plus. But for you, I know you did mention like maybe it might be closer to four hours sometimes.
[00:09:33.870] 我之前都没想过外卖，但你说得对。那简直是完美的“腐烂食物”，因为你什么都不用做，吃完直接扔垃圾就行了。没错，就是这样。连一个餐具都不用洗。可能就一个杯子吧。不过我觉得对我来说，我总是想着吃东西，因为我的“腐烂”时间，嗯，大概六到八个小时甚至更久。但我知道你之前说过，有时候可能也就四个小时左右。
[00:10:01.690] So would you prefer your rot day to have a meal or are you okay with it to have just like snacks or something more casual? I guess this is like the unhealthy part of my rot sessions. If it does, you know, go on to be a pretty long session, I get stuck in this loop of, oh, what should I eat? And then it's like, well, I don't want to think about that right now. Or like, I can't decide right now. You get caught up in whatever you're doing, right?
[00:10:01.690] 所以，你觉得休息日吃顿饭比较好，还是吃点零食或者其他更随意的食物也行？我觉得这算是休息过程中不太健康的地方。如果休息时间比较长，我就会陷入“我该吃什么？”的循环里。然后我又会想，哎，我现在不想考虑这个问题。或者，我现在没法决定。你很容易沉浸在自己正在做的事情里，对吧？
[00:10:30.450] Like watching something or like scrolling or whatever. So then, you know, you kind of blink your eyes and then you're like, oh, shoot, I need to eat a meal for well-being, basically. So there's a couple of things that I do. I always keep very easy, ready to make food in the fridge, just like frozen foods pretty much. Some like really easy ones, hot pockets. Oh, yes. Chicken tenders, like air friable ones.
[00:10:30.450] 就像看电视、刷手机什么的。然后，你知道，你眨眨眼，突然意识到，哎呀，我得吃顿饭了，为了身体健康嘛。所以我有几个办法。我总是在冰箱里备着一些很简单的速食，比如冷冻食品。有些特别方便，像热口袋饼。哦，对了。还有鸡柳，那种空气炸鸡柳。
[00:11:00.610] And I also have like microwave kimbap, which is like... Oh, that's a banger. Yeah. And I mean, of course, there's always a stash of ramen too. But as we've discussed, that would cause dishes. Right. And like even if you did just the pot and you ate out of the pot, that's still utensils and like a pot and a lid that you'd have to wash. True.
[00:11:00.610] 我还有微波炉紫菜包饭，那玩意儿……哦，真是太棒了。是啊。当然，我家里也总会备着一些拉面。但就像我们之前讨论的，那会弄得满碗筷。没错。就算你只用锅，直接用锅吃，那也还是得用餐具，锅和锅盖都得洗。确实如此。
[00:11:27.490] And the problem with ramen is that used to be like one of my go-to frought meals because it's so easy. But the problem is it makes your like house smell. Oh, that's so true. And you have to like really ventilate the shit out of your place after. And I'm like, oh, God, that's a lot of windows I got to open. So I've also started straying away from ramen. I did try like getting some literal bowl ramens, the ones in the cups. And I was like, it's not bad, but it's just not the same.
[00:11:27.490] 拉面的问题在于，它曾经是我最常吃的食物之一，因为它太方便了。但问题是，它会让你的房子充满味道。哦，确实如此。吃完之后你得拼命通风。我当时就想，天哪，我得开多少窗户啊。所以我也开始尽量少吃拉面了。我试过那种杯装的拉面，就是那种碗装的。我觉得，味道还不错，但就是不一样。
[00:11:57.570] The package ramen is definitely better. Yeah. Yeah. I also had this phase, this very glorious phase where to truly maximize less work and stuff. I think I had hosted something at my place and then I had leftover paper plates. So every time I had to microwave or air fry something, I would just dump that shit onto the paper plate once it's ready. Oh my gosh. So I wouldn't have to do any dishes.
[00:11:57.570] 方便面确实更好吃。是啊，是啊。我之前也有过一段时期，一段非常美好的时期，就是想尽可能地减少工作量和杂事。我记得当时我在家招待客人，然后剩下了一些纸盘子。所以每次我用微波炉或空气炸锅加热东西的时候，我都会把做好的东西直接倒在纸盘子上。天哪！这样我就不用洗碗了。
[00:12:26.950] Dude, that's hella funny. The day I ran out of my final paper plate. Yeah. It was a sad day. Damn, that's genius. I feel like I always buy like a 50 pack of paper plates or like a 20 pack or something when we host people. There's always like just a handful of plates left. So I just have like a stack of unused, unmatched paper plates in my closet. You got to use them. Just sitting there.
[00:12:26.950] 老兄，这也太搞笑了。我最后一个纸盘用完的那天，真是太惨了。是啊，那天真是难过。哎，这主意真绝了。感觉每次家里来客人，我都会买50个装或者20个装的纸盘什么的。结果总是只剩下几个。所以我衣柜里就堆着一堆没用过的、不配套的纸盘。总得用掉它们吧，就那么放着呢。
[00:12:56.920] You're so right, honestly. Yeah. You could put some hot pockets on them and microwave them. You could, you can air fry fries and then just put it in the paper plate. True. Well, what about like snacks? Do you have any go-to easy snacks for a good rot sush? I actually do have some snacks around. My favorite snack is like this one popcorn brand called Lesser Evil.
[00:12:56.920] 你说得太对了，真的。是啊。你可以放些热口袋饼在上面，然后用微波炉加热。你也可以用空气炸锅炸薯条，然后直接放在纸盘里。没错。那零食呢？你有没有什么方便快捷的零食，适合吃烤肉的时候吃？我其实手边有一些零食。我最喜欢的零食是那种叫“Lesser Evil”的爆米花。
[00:13:22.960] I feel like that's a good one because they claim to use like pretty clean and natural ingredients. So you feel good about eating it. It's like guilt free. Yeah. You're like, this is healthy. Okay. And low key popcorn is actually like a great source of fiber. True. So there's some health benefits there. I've been really into this dried dragon fruit snack lately. Whoa. I know these all sound so healthy, which is weird, right? Wait, you're so like crunchy.
[00:13:22.960] 我觉得这个不错，因为他们声称用的都是很干净天然的原料。所以吃起来感觉很好，没什么负罪感。对，你会觉得，这很健康。好吧。而且爆米花其实是很好的膳食纤维来源。没错。所以它对健康有一些好处。我最近特别喜欢吃火龙果干。哇哦。我知道这些听起来都很健康，是不是有点奇怪？等等，你看起来真像个脆脆的零食。
[00:13:54.400] But this is unintentional. They were just, they're just good. I was like, oh, this is kind of good. But the issue is that low key, a lot of snacks that I have, me and my boyfriend were joking about this recently. He was like, how come your snacks are so like laxative snacks? Dragon fruit makes you use the bathroom. And then popcorn, great source of fiber.
[00:13:54.400] 但这并非有意为之。它们只是，它们真的很好吃。我当时就想，哦，这还不错。但问题是，我平时吃的很多零食，我和我男朋友最近还开玩笑说起过这个。他说，为什么你的零食都像泻药一样？火龙果会让你跑厕所。还有爆米花，纤维含量很高。
[00:14:24.330] So that's like helpful too. And then I actually also have a bag of prunes, which is like an old person snack. I know. But it's also really good for using the bathroom. You might be like an 80 year old grandma trapped in a 28 year old body. Yeah. Dried prunes? That's crazy. Yeah. You know what the thing is? Is it sugared at least? Yeah. It's like, it's the ones from Costco. So they're like, they're not quite dry. And they're like pretty sweet.
[00:14:24.330] 所以这也挺有用的。我还有一袋西梅干，我知道，这玩意儿听起来像老年人的零食。但它对通便也很有帮助。你可能感觉自己像个80岁的老奶奶，却困在28岁的身体里。是啊。西梅干？太疯狂了。是啊。你知道那玩意儿怎么样吗？至少是加糖的吧？对。就是那种在Costco买的。它们其实不太干，而且很甜。
[00:14:54.290] They're honestly pretty good. But you shouldn't eat more than like three or four. Because then they'll truly be like laxatives. That's kind of compelling, actually. Because there's like a natural stopping point. You know, otherwise there's like dire consequences. Yeah. I think the thing is that I'm not like a huge snacker. So I just have like specific ones that I know I like.
[00:14:54.290] 说实话，它们确实挺好吃的。不过你最好别吃超过三四个，不然真的会像泻药一样。其实这挺有道理的，因为吃多了就有个限度，不然后果不堪设想。嗯，我觉得关键是我平时不太爱吃零食，所以我只吃自己喜欢的特定口味。
[00:15:22.490] And then if I remember it, I'll like pull it out and snack on it a bit. But otherwise, yeah, I generally don't snack that much. So when you do snack with your three mentioned snacks, do you like to make yourself the little snack plate? Or will you just pull out the bags? No, dude. I just take this shit straight out of the bag. I'm like hugging the bag. I'm like sitting there. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:15:22.490] 然后如果我记得的话，我会拿出来吃一点。但除此之外，嗯，我一般不怎么吃零食。所以当你吃你提到的那三种零食时，你会用小碟子装起来吗？还是直接把袋子拿出来？不，哥们儿。我直接把这些东西从袋子里拿出来。我就像抱着袋子一样。我就坐在那儿。对。对。
[00:15:52.050] Do you make a snack plate? Well, now that I'm thinking about it, I feel like I have two different types of rot sessions. So there's the type that I was kind of talking about earlier where I'm like, oh, the house needs to be clean. And like, I have to be free of chores and blah, blah, blah. I feel like the free of chores part is actually universal with my two rot sessions. But there's like a rot session where I'm like a perfect, clean princess, you know?
[00:15:52.050] 你会准备零食拼盘吗？嗯，现在想想，我觉得我的“放松模式”有两种。一种是我之前提到的，就是那种感觉，比如，哦，房子得打扫干净。还有，我得摆脱家务，等等等等。我觉得摆脱家务这一点其实在我两种“放松模式”里都是共通的。但还有一种“放松模式”，我就像个完美无瑕、干净整洁的公主，你知道吗？
[00:16:19.970] And I'm like, everything I eat needs to go in like a cute bowl. And like, you know, everything I put into my body has to be like really clean and like fun and like cute. And then I think there's like the other version where I'm like a gremlin, you know? Yeah. I am fine eating out of a bag. I'm just like in sweats, like curled up fetal. And my standards aren't very high for the rot session. So it's like the princess rot sesh. I'll make like a little snack plate.
[00:16:19.970] 我当时就想，我吃的所有东西都得装在可爱的小碗里。你知道，我吃进肚子里的所有东西都必须非常干净、有趣、可爱。然后我觉得还有另一种状态，我就像个小恶魔，你知道吗？对。我甚至可以用袋子装东西吃。我就穿着运动服，蜷成一团。我对“腐烂”环节的要求不高。所以这就像是公主腐烂环节。我会准备一小盘零食。
[00:16:47.170] But if I'm a gremlin that day, I'm also just eating that shit out of a bag. But doesn't that mean you'll have dishes to do? Yes. Yes. Dang. So the sacrifice is necessary at that point though. Because it maximizes enjoyment, you know? Okay. I think my rot sessions are like all gremlin status. Like I have this giant hoodie, snuggie thing that I'll wear.
[00:16:47.170] 但如果我那天状态像个小恶魔，那我就只能直接从袋子里抓一把吃。但这岂不是意味着你得洗碗吗？是啊，是啊，真倒霉。所以，这种牺牲在那种情况下是必要的。因为这样才能最大程度地享受美食，你知道吗？好吧。我觉得我那些放纵的时候就像是完全进入了小恶魔状态。就像我会穿上一件超大的连帽衫，那种毛茸茸的睡衣。
[00:17:16.270] And then I'll just like curl up on the couch in this big bundle of just blanket and like hoodie. I have a lot of really gremlin-y ones. I wonder what the difference is. Sometimes I'm just in the mood to be like, I don't know, like to really like burrow in somewhere and fucking rot. And other times I'm like, oh, okay. During my rot session today, I'll do a face mask. And I'll do this. And, you know, be like a perfect princess.
[00:17:16.270] 然后我就会蜷缩在沙发上，裹着毯子和连帽衫。我有很多像小恶魔一样的毛病。我很好奇它们之间有什么区别。有时候我就是想找个地方钻进去，彻底腐烂。而有时候我又会想，哦，好吧。今天我“腐烂”的时候，我会敷个面膜。然后我会做这个。你知道，就像个完美的公主。
[00:17:44.910] Okay, dude, that's not a rot session anymore. That's like a spa session. One face mask is all it takes to be a spa session. Yeah, because you gotta wash your face and put the mask on. And then you have to get up later to like toss the mask and like pat everything in. That's true. Well, on a princess rot sesh, one of the things that I have to do to like really start it is to have a good shower. Okay, that's fair.
[00:17:44.910] 好吧，老兄，那已经不是“腐烂疗程”了，那简直就是SPA。敷个面膜就够SPA了。是啊，因为你得先洗脸再敷面膜。然后过一会儿你还得起来把面膜扔掉，再轻轻拍打吸收。没错。嗯，公主式的“腐烂疗程”里，我真正开始之前必须先好好洗个澡。好吧，这说得通。
[00:18:13.270] But my gremlin ones, the cleanliness doesn't really matter to me. Like the shower comes at the end. Yeah. It can even come tomorrow. I feel that. Yeah. Yeah. Those gremlin ones I feel like are the best when it's like a Saturday and you truly have nothing to do. Yeah. You wake up and you go straight to the couch and the whole day is just rotting.
[00:18:13.270] 但对我来说，那些“小恶魔”式的胡闹，干净卫生什么的其实并不重要。比如洗澡，可以留到最后。对，甚至可以明天再洗。我懂那种感觉。对，对。我觉得那些“小恶魔”式的胡闹，在像周六那样真正无所事事的时候最棒了。对，你醒来就直接瘫在沙发上，一整天就这么虚度光阴。
[00:18:41.830] And you're like, dude, I didn't even do anything today anyway. Why would I need to shower? Yes, exactly. The gremlin ones are funny too because sometimes I'll just literally keep the curtains drawn all day. Dude, wait, that is so me. And then the next day when I open the blinds or like sometimes James will come back and he's like, why is it so dark in here? And I'll open the blinds. I'm like, oh, it's too bright. Like you're letting in too much light. Wait, that is so me. That reminds me of my college days too.
[00:18:41.830] 然后你就会想，老兄，反正我今天什么都没做，干嘛要洗澡？对，就是这样。那些关于小精灵的段子也很有趣，因为有时候我真的会一整天都把窗帘拉着。老兄，等等，这简直就是我本人。然后第二天，当我拉开窗帘，或者有时候詹姆斯回来，他会问，这里怎么这么黑？然后我就拉开窗帘。我会说，哦，太亮了。好像你让太多光线进来了。等等，这简直就是我本人。这让我想起了我的大学时代。
[00:19:10.270] I would never open the blinds. And then one time I woke up, I was like, what time is it? Like it's dark day and night. Dude, I remember once in our group chat, you were like, I just woke up and it was like 5pm or something egregious. But the crazier thing is half of our group chat was also like lols same. Like anyone want to grab food? We just all met up and had breakfast at like 6pm. College was a different time.
[00:19:10.270] 我从来不拉开百叶窗。有一次我醒来，心想：现在几点了？感觉天黑得跟白天黑夜一样。哥们儿，我记得有一次我们在群聊里，你说：“我刚醒，都下午五点了，或者更离谱的时间。” 更搞笑的是，群里一半的人都说：“哈哈，我也是。” 有人想一起吃点东西吗？我们最后约了大家，晚上六点左右吃了顿早餐。大学真是个不一样的时代。
[00:19:41.010] Okay, I have an important question now. Okay. What do you do in a rot session? Oh my god. I have like a whole carousel of things that I do actually. But it's always really like just a couple of things that I rotate. So one is I'll watch a show. I like to watch a couple of recurring Korean reality TV shows. So usually I'll like bank them up a little bit or like, you know, just sometimes life gets busy and I'm like, oh shoot, I should like catch up.
[00:19:41.010] 好了，我现在有个重要的问题。好的。你在休息时间都做什么？哦，我的天。我其实有很多事情要做。但我总是会轮流做其中几件事。比如，我会看剧。我喜欢看一些韩国的常驻真人秀节目。所以通常我会提前攒一些，或者你知道，有时候生活会变得很忙，然后我就想，哎呀，我得赶紧补上。
[00:20:07.870] And I'll just like binge watch it while playing whatever game that I'm playing at that moment. But the real favorite that I like to do when I'm rotting is to do that but audiobook instead of a TV show. So then I'll like listen to a full book while I'm playing a game. That's I think the perfect combination. Productive, dare I say. Exactly, right? Oh, so you actually don't really scroll TikTok?
[00:20:07.870] 我通常会一边玩游戏一边追剧。不过，我闲得无聊的时候最喜欢的消遣方式是听有声书而不是电视剧。我会一边玩游戏一边听完整本书。我觉得这是完美的组合。而且，我敢说，这很高效。没错吧？哦，所以你其实不怎么刷TikTok？
[00:20:35.780] You know, when I have dedicated rot time, the enjoyment that I get from scrolling TikTok is diminished a little bit. Oh. I don't know why. Like TikTok hits really good at 11pm on a weeknight when I'm supposed to be sleeping. But when I carve out like, okay, this eight hours is to like do nothing productive. It's just like slightly less fun. So I'll do it but not like a dedicated session. Ooh, it's almost like when someone finally gives you permission to do something, you're like, okay, never mind.
[00:20:35.780] 你知道吗，当我专门腾出时间放松的时候，刷TikTok的乐趣反而会减少一些。哦，我也不知道为什么。比如，在工作日的晚上11点，我本该睡觉的时候，刷TikTok反而特别有意思。但如果我特意安排了8个小时，什么都不做，那乐趣就稍微少了点。所以我还是会刷，但不会像以前那样专门刷一段时间。哦，感觉就像有人终于允许你做某件事的时候，你反而会想，好吧，算了。
[00:21:05.800] I'm not interested anymore. Exactly. Oh, okay, okay. What if you wanted to like rot and play a game, but that game has to be played on the computer? Is there a solution for that? Or it's an unroddable activity? Dude, that's a tough one. I will say I'm not someone who plays FPS games or even something like League of Legends, I
[00:21:05.800] 我没兴趣了。没错。哦，好吧，好吧。如果你想玩游戏，但必须在电脑上玩呢？有什么办法吗？还是说这是不可能实现的？老兄，这可真是个难题。我得说，我既不玩FPS游戏，也不玩像《英雄联盟》这样的游戏。
[00:21:33.100] feel like is something that I play extremely infrequently. So I don't have a ton of I have to play this game sitting on a computer. Because even games like TFT or, you know, Stardew Valley, or sometimes I'll play like mobile games on my phone, like all of that can be played on like a Switch or iPad. So I haven't encountered that much. However, I will say I have this really nice two monitor setup that is perfect for playing
[00:21:33.100] 感觉我玩这款游戏的频率非常低。所以我并没有太多“必须坐在电脑前玩”这种感觉。因为即使是像云顶之弈、星露谷物语，或者有时候我会在手机上玩的手机游戏，这些游戏都可以在Switch或iPad上玩。所以我很少遇到这种情况。不过，我得说，我有一套非常棒的双显示器配置，非常适合玩游戏。
[00:21:58.900] TFT because you can have your guide up on your left monitor, TFT up on like your central one. So when I was really into playing TFT like a couple years ago, I would actually just sit at my computer on rot days. Would you consider it still rotting? I would. It's like a necessary sacrifice. Nice. Because I was thinking about that, too. And I was like, I wonder if I the time I spend sitting at the computer to play games,
[00:21:58.900] 玩TFT是因为你可以把攻略放在左边的显示器上，TFT放在中间的显示器上。所以几年前我特别沉迷TFT的时候，我甚至会在游戏荒废的日子里就一直坐在电脑前。你觉得这还算是荒废吗？我觉得是。这就像是必要的牺牲。不错。因为我也在想这个问题。我就在想，我花在电脑前玩游戏的时间，
[00:22:27.280] if that counts as rotting sometimes, because I'm not gonna lie, dude, sometimes I sit here for a while. And I'm just like playing games. Yeah. The more I think about it, like after you said that, maybe you're right. Maybe it's not full rot. It's like a half rot, right? Because you're sitting up. Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say. Like you're sitting upright. There's a little more movement. Like you have to use your brain a bit. That's true.
[00:22:27.280] 如果这算腐烂的话，因为说实话，哥们，有时候我会在这儿坐一会儿，就玩游戏。是啊。你这么一说，我越想越觉得，也许你是对的。也许这不算完全腐烂，只是半腐烂，对吧？因为你至少是坐着的。对，我正想说这个。就像你坐得笔直，稍微动动，动动脑子。没错。
[00:22:56.840] And sometimes when I'm sitting on my computer, even when I'm playing games or something, I'll occasionally do something productive on Google Chrome. Like open up my Excel or like open up my sheets and like check on some spreadsheets. Wait, that's crazy. What? Or like, you know, like your itineraries for like upcoming travel. Oh, I see. I feel like I'm more inclined to open it really quick because it's so easy on a computer. It's like the urge is there. You're like, oh, well, I'm already here. Might as well just double check. Yes. Yes. This situation.
[00:22:56.840] 有时候我坐在电脑前，就算是在玩游戏什么的，偶尔也会用谷歌浏览器做点正事。比如打开Excel或者表格，看看一些电子表格。等等，这太疯狂了。什么？或者，你知道的，看看你即将到来的旅行计划。哦，我明白了。我觉得我更容易快速打开它们，因为在电脑上操作太方便了。就像是那种冲动。你会想，哦，反正都打开了，不如再检查一遍。对，对，就是这样。
[00:23:25.620] And then suddenly one hour later, you're like knee deep in activity research for travels or something. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it's not a full rod. I think it isn't because the game TFT that you mentioned, I've been playing that a lot lately. And honestly, I do play it at the computer, but that's serious TFT. I'm like locking in, you know, I'm ready. I have all my resources. I'm paying attention.
[00:23:25.620] 然后突然一个小时后，你就发现自己正埋头研究旅行之类的活动了。是啊，是啊。也许没那么深入。我觉得不是，因为你提到的云顶之弈，我最近玩得很多。老实说，我是在电脑上玩，但那是认真的云顶之弈。我会全神贯注，你知道，我准备好了。我资源充足。我全神贯注。
[00:23:51.560] But you can play that on mobile as well or like an iPad or something. And so when I'm like in bed or like on the couch and playing it on mobile, I'm like, oh, well, you know, this is like mobile. I can't lock in. So like I don't really play ranked on mobile and I just kind of play to mess around and just have fun. It's harder to, as you said, look up resources if you need it, like comps, item details or something like that.
[00:23:51.560] 不过你也可以在手机上玩，比如iPad之类的。所以当我躺在床上或者沙发上用手机玩的时候，我就会想，哎，毕竟是手机，没法集中注意力。所以我一般不在手机上打排位，就是随便玩玩，图个乐子。就像你说的，在手机上查攻略之类的资料比较麻烦，比如阵容搭配、装备详情之类的。
[00:24:20.880] So you're kind of just like, we're just having fun and winging it right now. That's true. There's like more of a casual sense for me as well when I play TFT on mobile. But it is more comfortable too. You're like, oh, yeah, I get to like rot basically. Now I'm like, is rotting just laying down for a long period of time? Maybe. Okay. Where is your favorite place to rot? My bed. A hundred percent.
[00:24:20.880] 所以你感觉就像，我们现在就是随便玩玩，随性发挥。确实如此。我在手机上玩云顶之弈的时候也有一种更轻松随意的感觉。而且也更舒服。你会觉得，哦，对啊，我基本上可以躺着了。现在我就想，躺着是不是就是长时间躺着？也许吧。好吧。你最喜欢在哪里躺着？我的床。百分之百。
[00:24:49.540] Because our bed has like the softest sheets and the like whatever thread count, like cotton. It's unbeatable. I love my couch, but it's just not the same. It isn't. Yeah. However, I will say if you lay in bed for a long time and you rot, I feel like something starts to hurt. Like my back starts to hurt or like my neck or like sometimes my arms will start to seize up or something. So then I will move settings.
[00:24:49.540] 因为我们的床单特别柔软，而且是那种高支数的纯棉床单，简直无可挑剔。我喜欢我的沙发，但感觉就是不一样。真的不一样。是啊。不过，我得说，如果你长时间躺在床上，感觉身体都软了，就会开始觉得哪里疼。比如背疼，脖子疼，或者有时候胳膊会僵硬什么的。所以那时候我就会换个睡姿。
[00:25:18.520] I'll go on like a little business trip to the couch. But your arms don't seize up on the couch? God, I don't know. Dude, so I've been playing a lot of like Nintendo Switch, right? Yeah. And my forearms literally start to get like tingly when I play too long. Oh, yeah. And I was like, is this normal? I get that too. Right? And I think it's worse because you're in like this specific position with your arms bent a certain way. And sometimes I'll play like laying down on one side, but whatever side that's getting
[00:25:18.520] 我会像出差一样去沙发上待一会儿。但是你的胳膊在沙发上不会僵硬吗？天哪，我不知道。哥们，我最近一直在玩任天堂Switch，对吧？是啊。玩久了，我的前臂就会开始发麻。哦，对。我就想，这正常吗？我也有这种感觉。对吧？我觉得更糟的是，你的胳膊会以某种特定的姿势弯曲。有时候我会侧躺着玩，但不管哪一侧……
[00:25:47.820] crushed by my body starts to like really feel tingly. So then I'll move to the couch because then you can kind of lay down, but have cushions under. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Lay down in like a sitting up way. Okay. Okay. I see. Dude, you know what you should get? There's like these wedge pillows made for rotting in bed. For that position specifically too. And then instead of putting all the weight on your arms. Yeah. You kind of put it like it's spread across your like body.
[00:25:47.820] 被压得喘不过气来，感觉浑身酥麻的。所以我就挪到沙发上，因为那样可以躺下，下面还有垫子。哦，哦，对。像坐着一样躺着。好的，好的，我明白了。哥们儿，你知道你应该买什么吗？那种楔形枕，专门用来在床上躺着的。就是为了那个姿势。这样就不用把所有重量都压在胳膊上了。对，你可以把它想象成分散在全身。
[00:26:16.900] Dude, it's funny that you say that because I just ordered two pillows. Oh my God. For our bed. I was like, I need more pillow. I need more buffer. Yeah. Are you also a bed rotter? Absolutely. Absolutely. I am 100% a bed rotter. There are days where it's like, did I even leave the bed? You check your step count and it's like two. Yeah.
[00:26:16.900] 老兄，你说得真巧，因为我刚订了两个枕头。我的天哪。是给床上用的。我就想，我需要更多枕头。我需要更舒服的枕头。是啊。你也是个赖床狂吗？绝对是。绝对是。我百分百是个赖床狂。有时候我都怀疑自己是不是根本没离开过床。你看看步数，才两步。是啊。
[00:26:47.080] Wait, actually. There's definitely days where the step count is so low. I'm like, yeah, these might've only been the steps to the bathroom. Yeah. Been there. There's just something so nice about being in bed and you wake up, you're already warm and cozy in bed. You don't need anything else. Like your devices are already near you.
[00:26:47.080] 等等，其实，确实有些日子步数少得可怜。我就想，嗯，可能只是去趟洗手间的步数而已。没错，我也有过这种经历。躺在床上感觉真好，醒来的时候，身上已经暖暖的，舒服极了。你什么都不需要。你的电子设备就在手边。
[00:27:12.480] And I also have like a projector in my bedroom so I can watch TV if I wanted to. Yes. So it's just, it's all there, you know? Like, why would I need to leave? So you never take a business trip out to your couch? I think if I do, it might be for a specific reason. Maybe I'm like, the TV's better outside. So this is like a serious movie. I should watch it on the better screen. Maybe it's like, oh shoot, you know what?
[00:27:12.480] 而且我卧室里还有个投影仪，想看电视的时候就能看。是啊。所以，一切都在那儿，你知道吗？就像，我干嘛要出门？所以你从来不会为了看电视而跑到沙发上？我觉得如果我出门，那肯定是有特殊原因的。比如，我会想，在外面看电视效果更好。比如，这是一部很严肃的电影，我应该在更好的屏幕上看。或者我会想，哎呀，你知道吗？
[00:27:42.380] I didn't bring my iPad in last night. So I have to go out and get it. But there is a very specific reason for going out as well, which is if I want to like play console games, then it's like, okay, that's hooked up to the TV. I would have to be out on the couch. Okay. I have a question for you. Yeah. When you are being a bedrider and you're on your bed, do you keep your door open or closed?
[00:27:42.380] 我昨晚没带iPad进来，所以得出去拿。不过我出去还有个特别的原因，就是如果我想玩主机游戏，那游戏机是连着电视的，我就得去沙发上玩。好的。我有个问题想问你。嗯，你卧床不起的时候，会把门开着还是关着？
[00:28:12.220] Your bedroom door. Whoa. That's a really good question. I might keep it closed. Whoa. The whole time? You know what? There might be a time limit. I think if it's still considered morning to me, which is up until 1 p.m., then I think I close the door.
[00:28:12.220] 你的卧室门。哇哦。这真是个好问题。我可能会一直关着它。哇哦。一直关着吗？你知道吗？也许会有个时间限制。我觉得如果对我来说还算是早上，也就是下午一点之前，那我就会把门关上。
[00:28:39.330] But once it hits like, oh, maybe I should be eating a meal right now, then I might leave the door open. Like I'm allowed to go outside into the world. The gate has been open. What about like nighttime? What if it was like 10 or 11 p.m.? Oh, closed for sure. Okay. I'm closing myself to the outside world. It's like a signal. Truly.
[00:28:39.330] 但一旦我意识到，哦，也许我现在应该吃饭了，那我可能就会把门开着。就像我可以出去到外面的世界一样。大门一直敞开着。那晚上呢？如果是晚上十点或十一点呢？哦，那肯定要关上。好吧。我要把自己与外界隔绝开来。这就像一个信号。真的。
[00:29:08.290] I think I'm exactly the same, actually. Like door open from when I wake up till like 8 p.m. or like 9 p.m. Then as soon as it's like dark outside, I close the door. Yeah. Because it's like now it's ritual time. Very true. True. I think also going back into your bed at night, there's kind of the intention to like eventually all fall asleep and end the day.
[00:29:08.290] 我觉得我跟你一模一样。我早上起床到晚上八九点，门都开着。然后一到天黑，我就把门关上。对，因为这就像是某种仪式。确实如此。没错。我觉得晚上回到床上，也是为了最终能睡着，结束一天。
[00:29:36.230] So I think that's also why it's like close the door because I sleep with my door closed. So it's just like part of the nighttime routine kind of. Yeah, I feel that. Also, I'm like afraid of the living room sometimes when it's like dark or when I'm the only one at home. I've always been like this every house that I lived at. So when it starts to get dark, I'm like, oh, okay. Time to like be nice and safe from the monsters in this bedroom. Wait, that's so true.
[00:29:36.230] 所以我觉得这也是为什么我会习惯关门的原因，因为我睡觉的时候门都是关着的。这就像是睡前仪式的一部分了。嗯，我也有这种感觉。而且，有时候我也会害怕客厅，尤其是在黑的时候，或者家里只有我一个人的时候。我以前住的每个房子都是这样。所以天黑的时候，我就会想，哦，好吧。是时候好好待在卧室里，远离那些怪物了。等等，这说得太对了。
[00:30:03.850] Like if someone were to break into your house, you need that extra barrier. So true, dude. Do you think other than the couch and the bed, is it even possible to have another option for a rotting location? Um, someone else's couch or bed? Okay. How about this? Like what if it was a like a lazy boy? Ooh, that's a lovely rot location.
[00:30:03.850] 就像如果有人闯入你家，你需要额外的屏障。说得太对了，兄弟。你觉得除了沙发和床，还有没有其他适合腐烂的地方？嗯，别人的沙发或床？好吧。那这个呢？比如说，如果是那种懒人沙发呢？哦，那可真是个绝佳的腐烂场所。
[00:30:33.290] But I guess that's like an extension of a couch, huh? Yeah. It's actually just like a combination of a couch and a bed. Okay. I have a question. Are you like open to contact during like a deep rot sesh? Oh, that's a really good question. I actually definitely do not use my phone that much. Or I mean like not answering texts because I might be on my phone.
[00:30:33.290] 不过我觉得它就像沙发的延伸部分，对吧？是的。它其实就是沙发和床的结合体。好的。我有个问题。在深度冥想的时候，你会保持联系吗？哦，这真是个好问题。我其实不太用手机。或者说，我不会因为在玩手机而回复短信。
[00:31:01.810] But yeah, I think I'm like, I'm like, don't bother me. It's like a do not disturb sign is on. Yes. A hundred percent. It's truly like I'm occupied by rot and I will get back to you after my session is over. It totally breaks the flow sometimes. It does. And I think there are good time break points where I will go and respond to someone. When I'm eating my meal, I will like respond to some texts.
[00:31:01.810] 是啊，我觉得我就是那种“别打扰我”的状态。就像挂了个“请勿打扰”的牌子一样。没错，百分之百是这样。我真的感觉自己正忙着处理事情，等我忙完之后再回复你。有时候真的会打断我的思路。确实如此。我觉得应该找个合适的时机回复别人。比如吃饭的时候，我就会回复一些短信。
[00:31:30.250] Or when I'm actually like about to sleep, I will open my phone and respond to people. Yeah. But right in the middle of my really, really good rot session, I'm like, don't contact me. Yeah. I'm definitely the same. You know, you're absorbed in what you're doing. Yes. Even though it might be mindless. Yeah. Oh, for me, it's a hundred percent. But I was thinking about it.
[00:31:30.250] 或者，当我快要睡着的时候，我会打开手机回复别人。是啊。但当我正沉浸在自己最专注的事情中时，我就会想，别联系我。是啊。我肯定也一样。你知道，你会完全沉浸在自己正在做的事情里。是的。即使那可能只是无意识的行为。是啊。哦，对我来说，百分之百是这样。但我一直在想这个问题。
[00:31:58.610] And to a certain extent, I think this age and this time period is where we can get the most satisfying rot sessions. And if someone were to have kids, you would just be so occupied, you know? Yeah. So lately, I've been thinking like, I need to like really enjoy and like capitalize on any rot time that I can. Because right now, it's like a normal part of my weekly or monthly routine. Maybe more like monthly.
[00:31:58.610] 在某种程度上，我认为这个年龄段和这个时期正是我们能享受最充实放松时光的时期。如果有人有了孩子，你就会忙得不可开交，你知道吗？是的。所以最近我一直在想，我需要好好享受并充分利用任何放松的时间。因为现在，放松就像是我每周或每月例行公事的一部分。也许更像是每月一次。
[00:32:26.410] But you know, you might not always have time for it. That's so true. Oh my God. You know, I had another thought. When you mentioned that like rotting is kind of part of your monthly routine. I realized there is an aspect. I mean, I guess it's not quite rotting, but it's like kind of on the similar line as being able to do this now, as you mentioned, as well as like it's time for your body to like recover and like take it easy.
[00:32:26.410] 但你知道，你可能并不总是有时间这么做。确实如此。我的天哪。你知道吗，我又想到一点。你提到“腐烂”好像是你每月例行程序的一部分。我意识到这其中确实有某种关联。我的意思是，虽然不完全算是腐烂，但就像你刚才说的，现在能做这件事，以及身体需要恢复和放松的时候，感觉有点类似。
[00:32:53.450] One thing is every week I have to have like one to two days where I can sleep in. And in a sense, that's almost like rotting, right? It's just like you're letting yourself indulge and sleep some extra hours. I feel like that's really crucial to my weekly routine. And if I miss it, I'm like really grumpy the next week. And you're so right.
[00:32:53.450] 有一件事我必须每周留出一两天时间睡懒觉。从某种意义上说，这简直就像是在放纵自己，对吧？就像是在犒劳自己，多睡几个小时。我觉得这对我的每周作息至关重要。如果我错过了，下周我就会特别暴躁。你说得太对了。
[00:33:17.010] Like if you say like I were to have kids or something, then sleeping in would be next to impossible, at least for those first few years. Yeah, that's so true. I know there's something about like on a day to day basis, I can go without this much sleep or like this much whatever. But on like a weekly level, if it doesn't all balance out to like a certain standard, I totally feel you on like it ruining my next week.
[00:33:17.010] 比如说，如果我有了孩子什么的，那睡懒觉几乎是不可能的，至少头几年是这样。是啊，确实如此。我知道每天的睡眠时间长短可能有所不同，我可以少睡一会儿，或者少睡一会儿。但如果每周的睡眠时间没有达到某个标准，我完全理解你说的，这会毁了我接下来一周的心情。
[00:33:45.590] I'm trying to imagine what a rot session would look like as a parent. And I actually have some childhood memories where I think maybe like once a month or something, we would have like a family rot sesh. Oh my God. Where we would all like lay on the couch and watch TV and just like hang out and like snack and eat and chat for like the entire day. Wow. And we would like get takeout and just like eat on our coffee table.
[00:33:45.590] 我试着想象作为父母，我们一家人一起“吃零食”会是什么样子。我小时候确实有一些记忆，大概一个月一次吧，我们家会搞一次“吃零食”的家庭聚会。天哪！我们全家人会躺在沙发上看电视，一边吃零食一边聊天，一整天都这样。哇！我们还会叫外卖，然后在茶几上吃。
[00:34:12.590] And we were just like all like, yeah, it was literally just like a family like group rot session, you know? That's nice. So I was like, maybe once the kids are older, like you're able to do things like that. But they have to be past the bored, crazy toddler stage. True. Dude, that brings us back to the one of the first questions you asked. Like, is it possible to rot with people?
[00:34:12.590] 我们当时就觉得，是啊，那简直就像一家人一起腐烂一样，你知道吗？挺好的。所以我就想，也许等孩子们大一点，就可以一起做这种事了。但他们得先过了无聊又疯狂的幼儿阶段。没错。哥们，这又让我们回到了你最初问的问题之一。比如，有可能和别人一起腐烂吗？
[00:34:36.670] I guess the possibilities are endless, but you just have to create a new standard of what rotting is. You know, that's true. Rotting by myself looks so different from rotting with my husband or rotting with my parents. Because like then you have to like interact with these people. Yes, but it's low stakes. Like, you know how in a regular hangout, you're like hanging. And then when you like talk about something, there has to be like this intense back and forth.
[00:34:36.670] 我想可能性是无穷无尽的，但你必须重新定义“腐烂”的含义。你知道，确实如此。独自腐烂和与丈夫或父母一起腐烂截然不同。因为那样你必须和这些人互动。没错，但风险很低。就像你知道的，在普通的聚会中，你们只是闲聊。然后当你们谈论某个话题时，就必须有那种激烈的互动。
[00:35:04.470] Not to make a fucking conversation sound like a battle, but there is like a standard of like, okay, you have to like also be committed to this conversation. I feel like a good rot session, that standard is a lot lower. You're just musing. You're just vibing. I see. I see. So have you rotted with your husband? Oh, yeah. How does that look like? It's like a combination of duo time, solo time.
[00:35:04.470] 我不想把聊天说得像打仗一样，但聊天确实有个标准，比如，你得对聊天投入点心。我觉得如果是那种轻松的闲聊，这个标准就低多了。你只是在思考，只是在放松。我明白了，我明白了。那你和你老公一起闲聊过吗？哦，当然。那是什么感觉？有点像两人独处和两人独处相结合。
[00:35:34.970] Like a lot of the prereqs and stuff are still there. But we'll go on our phones and like do things individually for like 20, 30 minutes. And then we'll turn over and like hang out and like watch something for 30 minutes. And then we'll turn back over and do our own shit. It's like a back and forth. So if you feel like you're craving that alone time again, like you just do it. Is this intriguing to you? Does it make you more open to a duo rot slash? Oh, I don't know.
[00:35:34.970] 很多前提条件之类的东西都还在。我们会各自玩手机，做自己的事情，大概20、30分钟。然后我们会翻身，一起待一会儿，看看电视什么的，30分钟。之后我们再翻身，各自做自己的事。就这样来回切换。所以如果你又想独处一会儿，那就去做吧。你觉得这有意思吗？这会让你更愿意尝试双人组队吗？哦，我不知道。
[00:36:03.550] Well, the issue is like, I feel like I just wouldn't interact. You're like, oh, you could toggle the like individual and together time. I want 100% individual. Like I would just be a lump there, you know? They can try to interact with me. And I'll probably respond a little bit. I mean, fair enough.
[00:36:03.550] 嗯，问题是，我觉得我根本不会跟他们互动。你说，哦，你可以切换一下个人时间和集体时间。但我想要百分之百的个人时间。感觉我就像个木头人一样孤零零地待在那里，你知道吗？他们可以试着跟我互动。我大概会稍微回应一下。嗯，好吧。
[00:36:31.910] Maybe the closest thing would be like if I saw a funny meme, I'd be like, oh my God, look at this. And then I'd go back to my rotting. You like airdrop it to that. You don't even say anything in real life. Like that's genius. Honestly, maybe that just means a good rot session to you is like a very sacred alone time thing. I think that's also completely fair too. Yeah, honestly, maybe.
[00:36:31.910] 最接近的可能就是，如果我看到一个搞笑的梗图，我会说：“我的天哪，快看这个！”然后我就继续我的“腐烂”时间。你可以用隔空投送发过去。现实生活中你甚至都不用说话。这简直太妙了。说真的，也许对你来说，好好“腐烂”就像一段非常神圣的独处时光。我觉得这也完全说得通。嗯，说真的，也许吧。
[00:36:57.310] It's definitely like a recharge, no one bother me time. I guess that's true because I am an introvert. So that's like the true, you know, recharge time. Right. Let me ask you this since you're an introvert. Do you think there's a ideal cadence for how often you have a good long rot session? So if you have a ton of rot sessions in one month, is it too much or is it never too much? Oh my God. It might be okay.
[00:36:57.310] 这绝对就像是给自己充充电，谁也不打扰我的时间。我想这很正常，因为我是个内向的人。所以这才是真正的充电时间。对。既然你也是个内向的人，那我就问你一个问题。你觉得多久进行一次长时间的深度放松（rot time）比较理想？也就是说，如果一个月进行很多次深度放松，会不会太多？或者永远不会太多？我的天哪。也许没问题。
[00:37:28.180] Damn. Okay, I think it also depends. You probably want a little bit of human interaction, but like you can get that at work. Yeah. So I feel like low key if I didn't hang out with friends for a month and just like rotted all month and rested, I wouldn't be that bothered.
[00:37:28.180] 哎。好吧，我觉得这也要看情况。你可能想要一点人际交往，但工作上也能满足你。是啊。所以我觉得，如果我一个月不跟朋友出去玩，就这么虚度光阴休息，我其实也不会太在意。
[00:37:59.260] But I think it would be a little different if it were like other people are actually, they're still hanging out. Someone had a birthday, but they just didn't invite me. That's a little fucked up. Yeah. And I'm talking like, you know, closest friends here. It's like, wait a second, just because I'm rotting doesn't mean you don't need to invite me. But if it was just like, oh, it just happens that this month everyone's busy and we didn't find time to get together.
[00:37:59.260] 但我觉得如果像其他人那样，情况就有点不一样了，他们其实还在聚会。有人过生日，却没邀请我。这有点儿不地道。是啊。我说的是那种，你知道的，最亲密的朋友。就好像，等等，就算我病入膏肓，你们也不用不邀请我吧。但如果只是，哦，这个月大家都很忙，我们没时间聚聚，那就另当别论了。
[00:38:26.120] I probably would be like, okay, more time for me. Even just in our friendship, there's been times where sometimes you and I will go into like a month long rot. Like sometimes it's just accidental, like other people are traveling or whatever and you and I are like, oh, fuck yes. And then we'll like see each other after like a month of rotting. And I can just tell you're like glowing. Oh my God. That's so funny. But okay.
[00:38:26.120] 我大概会想，好吧，多点时间给我自己。就算只是在我们友谊里，有时候你我也会冷落一个月之久。有时候纯粹是意外，比如别人出差什么的，然后你我突然就想，哦，太好了。然后我们冷落了一个月之后再见面。我能感觉到你容光焕发。我的天哪。太搞笑了。好吧。
[00:38:53.840] Actually, you're probably right though, because I'm sure if I had to hang out with people consistently once or twice a week for a whole month, I'm sure my appearance is like more and more haggard every time. Like the dark circles coming out. I notice when we hang out a lot, if the cadence is really frequent, you start to say like, okay guys, should we go home? Like a lot of hangouts.
[00:38:53.840] 其实你说的可能没错，因为如果我必须每周和别人聚会一两次，持续一个月，我肯定会越来越憔悴，比如黑眼圈会越来越明显。我发现如果我们经常聚会，频率太高，你就会开始说：“好了，伙计们，我们回家吧？” 就像聚会太多次一样。
[00:39:23.640] And I think when you have like more time to rot in between the hangouts, you don't do it as often. Oh my God. It's so funny. I like recently was thinking about it. Wait, I think you're so right actually. Oh my God. That is such a good point. Because even just recently, there was a period of time where we saw each other like every week and you're so right. By the end, I was like, guys, like it's a time to go home.
[00:39:23.640] 我觉得，如果聚会间隔时间长了，闲着没事干，聚会频率自然就会降低。我的天哪，这太搞笑了。我最近一直在想这个问题。等等，你说的太对了。我的天哪，你说得太对了。因为就在不久前，我们几乎每周都见面，你说的太对了。到最后，我就觉得，伙计们，是时候回家了。
[00:39:55.220] It's a good observation. Yeah. I feel like for me, it's a little different because I am more extroverted. So I thrive a little bit more on that like social energy sometimes. So if there's too long in between hangouts, I'll start to go crazy a little bit. You're like someone taking me out of this cave. Yeah. And you know what I realized? I think physically I enjoy rotting. I like just like laying there and doing nothing. Yeah.
[00:39:55.220] 观察得很仔细。是啊。我觉得我的情况有点不一样，因为我比较外向。所以我有时候更需要社交能量。如果太久没聚会，我就会有点抓狂。你就像把我从洞穴里拉出来的人。是啊。你知道我意识到什么了吗？我觉得我其实挺享受腐烂的状态。我喜欢就那样躺着什么都不做。是啊。
[00:40:24.320] But I think mentally I can't handle it. So even though my body wants to continue rotting, I just start to go mentally insane. So I don't even know that I want to break the rot. I see. But I need to for my sanity. Yeah. You're like, oh, that's weird. I'm in like a bad mood, even though I'm doing things I love. I'm like, why does this game not bring me joy anymore? I see. That makes sense. Yeah.
[00:40:24.320] 但我觉得我的精神承受不了。所以即使我的身体想要继续腐烂，我的精神也开始崩溃。所以我甚至不知道自己是否想要摆脱这种腐烂。我明白了。但我为了保持理智必须这么做。是啊。你会觉得，哦，这很奇怪。我心情很差，即使我在做我喜欢的事情。我会想，为什么这个游戏不再让我快乐了？我明白了。这说得通。是啊。
[00:40:51.860] I think that can happen to me too, but my tolerance is probably a little longer than yours. But yeah, it's like at a certain point, you're kind of like, okay, maybe I should see some humans and like have some real interactions. Yeah. Like, do I need to touch grass? Yeah. Yeah. And like stop talking to these NPCs. Exactly. Exactly. So I would have to guess that my sweet spot is maybe like once a month or twice a month
[00:40:51.860] 我觉得我也可能会这样，不过我的忍耐力可能比你强一些。但是，确实，到了某个时候，你会觉得，好吧，也许我应该见见真人，进行一些真正的互动。对啊。比如，我需要摸摸草地吗？对啊。对啊。还有，别再跟这些NPC说话了。没错。没错。所以我估计，对我来说最合适的频率大概是一个月一两次吧。
[00:41:21.760] if I've been like super, super busy. Dude. Okay. Yeah. We're like kind of different. Because if I had like a busy month previously, low key, I'm just like, guys, don't bother me for the next month. Like, I'll see you next month. Dude, I feel like our listeners think you're joking. But no, this is something that Crystal actually says to our group chats.
[00:41:21.760] 如果我特别特别忙的话。哥们儿。好吧。是啊。我们俩情况不太一样。因为如果我上个月特别忙，我就会说，伙计们，下个月别来烦我。就像，下个月见。哥们儿，我觉得我们的听众会以为你在开玩笑。但不是，这是Crystal真的会在我们的群聊里说的话。
[00:41:49.090] I think like the biggest thing was when I first moved back from New York and I was like, wow, I'm like exhausted. And I was like, guys, just next month. Okay. Like, I'm so tired. Dude. But if I think about it, February has been kind of a rotting month for me. But we have hung out a couple times. But as like a whole, this month is a rotting month. We were actually just talking about this yesterday.
[00:41:49.090] 我觉得最难熬的就是我刚从纽约搬回来的时候，当时我就觉得，哇，我累死了。然后我就说，哥们儿，下个月再说吧。好吧。我真的太累了。老兄。但仔细想想，二月对我来说简直糟透了。虽然我们还是见了面几次。但总的来说，这个月真的糟透了。我们昨天还在聊这个呢。
[00:42:17.170] Like Jan and Feb tend to be prime rotting months for us where we hibernate a little bit and it's okay because everyone else is also hibernating or traveling. But for some reason this year, it's felt more busy. But you're right. I think it's like a good mix of busy, but also has healthy rotting days, which is great. Wait, then like how many times is too much rotting for you within a month? I feel like it can't be more than like three times.
[00:42:17.170] 一月和二月通常是我们“腐烂”的高峰期，我们会稍微“冬眠”一下，这也没什么，因为其他人要么在“冬眠”，要么在旅行。但不知为何，今年感觉格外忙碌。不过你说得对。我觉得现在这种忙碌和“腐烂”的平衡挺好的，既忙碌又有健康的“腐烂”日子，这很棒。等等，那一个月里“腐烂”多少次对你来说才算太多呢？我觉得应该不能超过三次。
[00:42:47.150] You also have to think that I count a rotting session as like eight hours plus. Right, right. That's true. So then if I'm spending more than like three full days doing nothing but laying there, like playing video games in a month, that's kind of excessive. Okay, fine. I guess that's fair. Three is probably like my absolute max. And I guess also because you're limited, you could only really do yours on the weekend or like a Friday.
[00:42:47.150] 你还得考虑到我把“躺着玩游戏”算作八小时以上。对对，没错。所以如果我一个月里有三天以上什么都不做，只是躺在那里玩电子游戏，那就有点过分了。好吧，好吧。我想这说得通。三天大概是我的极限了。而且我想，因为你时间有限，所以你只能在周末或者周五之类的时间玩。
[00:43:15.290] So at most three weekends can be super restful, but at least one weekend has to be like social or productive. Yes, exactly. So I want to ask you the inverse of that question because you are an introvert. How many hangouts is too many in a month? Oh my God. Okay. In the Bay Area, dude, if we're hanging out like every week, that's kind of crazy.
[00:43:15.290] 所以最多三个周末可以完全放松，但至少要有一个周末用来社交或做些有意义的事情。没错，就是这样。所以我想问你一个反过来的问题，因为你是个内向的人。一个月聚会多少次才算太多？我的天哪。好吧。在湾区，哥们，如果我们每周都聚会，那就有点疯狂了。
[00:43:42.670] I just feel like the tempo here is slower, you know? We usually don't hang out every single week. Some of the weekends need to be for like cleaning and resting and gathering yourself. Yeah, that's right. But it's kind of different because there's different friend groups or like your SO's friends are also here.
[00:43:42.670] 我感觉这里的节奏比较慢，你知道吗？我们通常不会每周都聚。有些周末需要用来打扫卫生、休息和调整自己。是啊，没错。但这里的情况有点不一样，因为有不同的朋友圈，或者你伴侣的朋友也在这里。
[00:44:06.670] So in terms of total, you know, hangout count, is there like a limit to how many you could do per week, you think? I actually think I view it as if in a week, I don't have at least like two to three days where I can just be me and like rot or like, you know, do nothing. That's like not okay. And you're counting like weeknights post work.
[00:44:06.670] 所以，就聚会总数而言，你觉得每周聚会次数有限制吗？我个人觉得，一周里至少应该有两三天时间让我可以彻底放松，什么都不做。这样不行。而且你还把工作日晚上下班后的聚会也算进去了。
[00:44:35.810] Yeah, I think if I feel like a week was so busy, I didn't have alone time or time to like recharge. I literally also become grumpy in the next week. That's fair enough. Honestly, even as an extrovert, I totally feel that. And I feel like that's why our rot routines are so important because as much as it's like us just like they're eating girl dinners and like playing video games. It also helps us recover and be us.
[00:44:35.810] 是啊，我觉得如果一周特别忙，没有独处的时间，也没有时间充电，那接下来的一周我肯定会变得很暴躁。这很正常。说实话，即使我性格外向，也完全能体会到这一点。我觉得这就是为什么我们的放松习惯这么重要，因为这些习惯不仅能让我们像女生一样一起吃晚餐、玩电子游戏，还能帮助我们恢复精力，做回真正的自己。
