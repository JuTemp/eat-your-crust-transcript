[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Chengwei. Welcome back, Chengwei. The last time you were on our podcast was episode 120, Gym Rats and Gym Noobs. We're so happy to have you back to talk today about energizing hobbies
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是程伟。程伟，欢迎回来！你上次做客我们的播客是第120期，主题是“健身达人和健身菜鸟”。我们非常高兴你今天能回来和我们聊聊充满活力的爱好。
[00:00:26.960] and flow state. Before we get into the flow state of it all, I guess we can start a little bit more generally by talking about hobbies. So I feel like this is a pretty common small talk conversation topic that comes up. Oftentimes, you are probably asked,
[00:00:26.960] 以及心流状态。在深入探讨心流状态之前，我想我们可以先从一些更宽泛的话题开始，比如爱好。我觉得这是一个很常见的闲聊话题。你可能经常会被问到：
[00:00:43.600] Oh, what are your hobbies? Or what kind of hobbies do you have? So what are your go to answers for that question? Currently, I just say I like bouldering, mainly indoor bouldering. And then after that, I don't really have much to say about it.
[00:00:43.600] 哦，你有什么爱好？或者说你有什么类型的爱好？你通常会怎么回答这个问题？目前，我一般就说我喜欢抱石，主要是室内抱石。除此之外，我就没什么好说的了。
[00:00:58.560] So maybe I include like certain things I'm interested in at the moment. Right now, I'm trying to pick up some sewing. I'm kind of tired of paying 20 bucks just to get my pants
[00:00:58.560] 所以，我可能会分享一些我目前感兴趣的东西。比如现在，我正在学习缝纫。我有点厌倦了花20美元买条裤子。
[00:01:08.240] hemmed or my shirt. So yeah, those are kind of my go tos right now. I feel like those are pretty good hobbies to talk about. I actually struggle with this sometimes, like answering what my
[00:01:08.240] 比如我衬衫的下摆。所以，嗯，这些算是我现在最常聊的话题。我觉得这些都是很不错的爱好，可以聊聊。其实有时候我也会纠结这个问题，比如回答我……
[00:01:19.040] hobbies are, because I think it really depends on the context. I don't know how niche I can get with hobby sharing, potentially. So sometimes I almost like poke and prod and see where the other
[00:01:19.040] 爱好这东西，我觉得真的要看具体情况。我不知道分享爱好能有多小众。所以有时候我有点像是在试探，看看其他人会怎么想。
[00:01:32.800] person stands and how far of these hobbies can I go into. So the default go to hobbies, I don't know, like watching TV, if that counts as a hobby. But I do think it's a good segue into just like
[00:01:32.800] 一个人的立场，以及我可以深入研究这些爱好到什么程度。所以，默认的爱好，比如看电视，我不知道这算不算爱好。但我确实认为这是一个很好的过渡，就像……
[00:01:46.160] talking about like, Oh, what shows or movies are you watching lately? And it's very friendly to the general population. Yeah, it's an interesting one to answer for sure. Because I feel like it's hard to gauge what you can say to keep the conversation going. Because in one sense,
[00:01:46.160] 比如，问问大家最近在看什么剧或电影？这种话题对大众来说非常友好。是的，这确实是个很有意思的问题。因为我觉得很难把握该说什么才能让对话继续下去。因为从某种意义上说，
[00:02:02.560] I am trying to share like, Oh, these are my hobbies. But on another level, there are certain hobbies that I could say and then it would just like kill the convo, you know? So then recently,
[00:02:02.560] 我试着分享一些爱好，比如“哦，这些是我的爱好”。但另一方面，有些爱好我一说，话题就没了，你知道吗？所以最近，
[00:02:12.800] I was in a job interview. And my interviewer asked me, Oh, like, what do you like to do outside of work? And I kind of froze for a second. I was like, Oh, shit, like, what should I say? And what
[00:02:12.800] 我当时在面试。面试官问我：“哦，你工作之余喜欢做什么？” 我当时有点懵，愣了一下。我心想：“糟了，我该怎么说？”
[00:02:22.240] do I say to make me look like a good candidate, you know? So then I felt like I really racked my brain to think of holistic hobbies. I'm like, what can I say to make myself look social, fun,
[00:02:22.240] 我该怎么说才能让自己看起来像个合适的候选人呢？你知道吗？所以我就绞尽脑汁地想一些能提升个人魅力的爱好。我就想，我该怎么说才能让自己看起来善于交际、有趣呢？
[00:02:32.960] but also like indoorsy and intellectual. So I just like listed out a bunch of shit that I do. What did you say? I said something like, I have recently been getting really into pickleball and golf.
[00:02:32.960] 但我也喜欢宅在家里，喜欢钻研知识。所以我列举了一大堆我做的事情。你说什么？我说，我最近迷上了匹克球和高尔夫。
[00:02:45.360] But I also like to have some chill days inside with friends playing board games or reading books. And then based on what they were commenting on, I kind of dove deeper like, Oh, she was like,
[00:02:45.360] 但我也喜欢和朋友们待在家里，玩玩桌游或者看看书，放松放松。然后，根据他们的评论，我就开始深入思考，比如，哦，她当时是这么说的：
[00:02:56.800] Oh, what kind of books do you read? And then I was like, Oh, these are the genres I like, blah, blah. But by tossing out like four options, I was like, Okay, hopefully this like moves the
[00:02:56.800] 哦，你都读什么类型的书？然后我就说，哦，这些是我喜欢的类型，等等等等。但通过抛出四个选项，我想，好吧，希望这能有所进展。
[00:03:04.000] conversation somewhere. I feel like there's a couple that you two said that share a common theme, which is sports related stuff. So pickleball, bouldering, because I feel like these are a little more universal. It's like either you like sports or you don't. So it's an easy answer of,
[00:03:04.000] 刚才在某个地方聊到这个话题。我觉得你们俩提到的几个话题都有个共同点，那就是跟运动有关的东西。比如匹克球、抱石，因为我觉得这些比较大众化。就像要么你喜欢运动，要么你不喜欢。所以答案很简单：
[00:03:21.120] Oh, I know what that is. And whether like, I'm into it or not, especially if it's like a trendy sport, like, oh my god, bouldering and pickleball are so popular. But like, personally, that's not
[00:03:21.120] 哦，我知道那是什么。不管我喜不喜欢，尤其是一些很流行的运动，比如，天哪，抱石和匹克球现在太火了。但就我个人而言，那不是我的菜。
[00:03:31.840] really my thing. I like this. And then I feel like that's a pretty good like conversation continuer. Yeah, another great thing about Jisoo's spread of hobbies is that it includes like both indoors and outdoors. The person can really gravitate towards like, Oh, I'm actually an outdoorsy person too,
[00:03:31.840] 这正是我喜欢的。我很喜欢这个。而且我觉得这能很好地延续对话。是的，Jisoo兴趣广泛的另一个优点是，她的爱好涵盖了室内和室外活动。人们很容易就会被吸引，比如，“哦，其实我也是个喜欢户外活动的人。”
[00:03:48.000] or a sportsy person or Oh, I like enjoying time at home doing these hobbies as well. Do you ever get like, dude, I don't know how to describe this, like almost like embarrassment of
[00:03:48.000] 或者你是个运动爱好者，或者，哦，我也喜欢在家享受这些爱好带来的乐趣。你有没有过这种感觉，老兄，我不知道该怎么形容，就像有点尴尬……
[00:03:58.560] sharing your hobbies. I think sometimes so like at work, I didn't mention that I like love to play golf for the longest time because I was like, Oh god, what if they think it's like such a
[00:03:58.560] 分享你的爱好。我觉得有时候，比如在工作中，我一直没提我喜欢打高尔夫，因为我当时想，天哪，万一他们觉得这很不可思议怎么办？
[00:04:10.560] pretentious sport and then like, they'll have some sort of judgment of me if I say like, Oh, I also like golf. It took me a while to like feel more comfortable and then be like, Yeah,
[00:04:10.560] 他们觉得高尔夫是一项很装腔作势的运动，然后如果我说“哦，我也喜欢高尔夫”，他们就会对我评头论足。我花了好长时间才感觉自在些，然后才说：“是啊。”
[00:04:20.960] haha, I golfed this weekend. And it was so fun because I love golf. I think I have felt slightly uncomfortable sharing or divulging certain hobbies. But maybe not so much like the pretentious aspect that I'm scared of, but more so looking like
[00:04:20.960] 哈哈，我这周末去打高尔夫了。真的超好玩，因为我超爱高尔夫。我觉得分享或透露某些爱好有点不太自在。不过，可能不是因为害怕显得装腔作势，而是怕别人觉得我……
[00:04:34.880] an imposter. I am not like to this day, I am still very bad at golf. And I am very much like a vibes person. I like to show up have fun. And then that's fine. Like I don't really live or die by
[00:04:34.880] 一个冒牌货。直到今天，我还是打不好高尔夫。而且我非常注重氛围。我喜欢出现，享受乐趣。这样就挺好。我并不真的那么在意别人的看法。
[00:04:46.480] the score or anything. But once I was talking to this corker at work, and I was like just starting to get to know this person because they were new to the company. And we're like talking about our
[00:04:46.480] 比分什么的。但有一次，我在公司跟一个很棒的人聊天，我们刚开始认识，因为他是新来的。我们聊着我们的……
[00:04:55.120] hobbies and stuff. And I was like, Oh, yeah, recently, I've been like golfing a little bit, trying to hit the courses and whatnot, blah, blah. And he was like, Oh, I love golf. I shoot
[00:04:55.120] 爱好什么的。然后我就说，哦，对，最近我打了会儿高尔夫，尽量去球场练练什么的，等等等等。然后他就说，哦，我喜欢高尔夫。我打得也很好。
[00:05:03.600] like a 80 something like what's your handicap? And I was like, Oh, my handicap is like extremely embarrassing. Like I regret even saying that I golf in the first place. So sometimes I do think
[00:05:03.600] 比如有人问我80多杆，我的差点是多少？然后我就说，哦，我的差点简直太丢人了。我甚至后悔当初说自己打高尔夫。所以有时候我确实会想……
[00:05:16.320] at what point am I allowed to call something a hobby? You know? Do you think you need to be good at something in order to call it a hobby? I think to an extent, I guess I just assume that's
[00:05:16.320] 我到底要到什么程度才能把某件事称为爱好？你知道吗？你觉得你必须擅长某件事才能称之为爱好吗？我觉得在某种程度上是这样，我猜我只是这么认为的。
[00:05:27.200] how other people see hobbies. Other people would not call something a hobby unless they were decent at it. But that's not how I see it. So then it's almost like a mismatch of expectations
[00:05:27.200] 其他人对爱好的看法各不相同。有些人觉得，如果某件事做得不够好，就不会称之为爱好。但我并不这么认为。所以，这就有点像期望值不一致了。
[00:05:37.200] that makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm like, Oh, I don't care calling this a hobby because I don't need to be like level 100 at something to enjoy it. But other people might judge me for
[00:05:37.200] 这让我感觉很不自在。我就想，哦，我不在乎把它叫做爱好，因为我不需要精通到100级才能享受它。但其他人可能会因此评判我。
[00:05:46.480] saying it's a hobby when maybe to them. I'm like such an amateur, like such a noob, you know? I see. Dude, but I lowkey feel like if you're a noob, that's like why it's a hobby. Hmm. Because you're not being competitive about it. You're just doing it for,
[00:05:46.480] 说这是爱好，但也许对他们来说，我就是个业余的，是个菜鸟，你知道吗？我明白了。兄弟，但我感觉如果你是个菜鸟，那它就成了爱好。嗯。因为你没有竞争意识。你只是为了……
[00:06:01.840] you know, the fun and enjoyment. True. Yeah, that's true too. Also, if you're like a straight up beginner, I feel like most people would phrase it more as a, Oh, I'm getting into this thing rather than saying, This is my hobby.
[00:06:01.840] 你知道，就是那种乐趣和享受。没错。是啊，也对。而且，如果你是个彻头彻尾的新手，我觉得大多数人会更倾向于说“哦，我开始接触这个了”，而不是说“这是我的爱好”。
[00:06:17.040] Yeah, I feel like it's something that I just have to get used to. And I guess the other part too is like who cares what other people think as long as you're fine, comfortable calling it a
[00:06:17.040] 是啊，我觉得我得慢慢习惯。而且我觉得另一方面，只要自己觉得舒服自在，管别人怎么想呢？
[00:06:25.920] hobby. But I just sometimes fear the judgment of when that question comes back from someone who, you know, is truly serious about it. And they're like, Oh, what's your handicap? And then you now have to expose yourself to the world. Yeah, especially when they share the same hobby.
[00:06:25.920] 爱好。但我有时害怕被那些真正认真对待这个问题的人评判。他们会问：“哦，你的障碍是什么？” 然后你就不得不向全世界暴露自己了。是啊，尤其当他们和你有同样的爱好时。
[00:06:40.880] Right. I got kind of embarrassed. Well, back in the day when I still did music, I get embarrassed when I share that I make music because I'm afraid of people pulling out their phone on the spot and
[00:06:40.880] 对。我当时有点尴尬。嗯，以前我还做音乐的时候，我一说自己做音乐就觉得尴尬，因为我怕别人当场拿出手机拍照。
[00:06:52.240] let me play a song. And then I'll just die of embarrassment. That's true. That is a scary one. I mean, I think for Crystal and I too, like podcasting is such a
[00:06:52.240] 让我放首歌吧。然后我肯定会尴尬死掉。真的。这太可怕了。我的意思是，我觉得对克里斯托和我来说，做播客也是件很……
[00:07:02.880] big part of our lives. And when it comes up, like when this question comes up, I always see the option of like, Oh, I could say that I'm a podcast host. And then I'm like, but then I have to do the
[00:07:02.880] 播客是我们生活中很重要的一部分。每当有人问起这个问题时，我总会想到另一种选择，比如，我可以说我是个播客主持人。然后我就会想，但是那样我就得做……
[00:07:12.640] whole explaining thing. They might want to know what the name is. And there's all these episodes in our catalog. So I can definitely relate to that here. Oh, my God. Yeah. I actually very rarely share about the podcast, especially if it's like meeting
[00:07:12.640] 解释起来很麻烦。他们可能想知道播客的名字。我们的节目库里有很多集。所以我完全能理解。哦，我的天哪。是啊。我其实很少跟人聊播客，尤其是在这种场合，比如见面的时候。
[00:07:25.840] a new person just because I'm like, Oh, God, they're gonna like listen to it. And there was actually one time where I met someone who's like a friend of a friend's and they listened to the
[00:07:25.840] 我会找个新朋友听，因为我会想，天哪，他们肯定会听的。确实有一次，我遇到一个朋友的朋友，他们听了我的歌。
[00:07:36.400] podcast when we met. We were like chatting and all that. And they're like, Oh, my God, I feel like even though this is our first time meeting face to face, I feel like I've cheated because I know
[00:07:36.400] 我们在播客节目里见面。我们当时在聊天什么的。然后他们说：“我的天哪，虽然这是我们第一次见面，但我感觉自己像作弊一样，因为我知道……”
[00:07:45.520] so much about you because I listen to the podcast. I think the other thing too is like, because we kind of touched upon this earlier, but I feel like so many activities are very associated
[00:07:45.520] 因为我听了你的播客，所以对你了解很多。我觉得还有一点，就像我们之前也稍微提到过，我觉得很多活动都密切相关。
[00:07:57.200] with like a certain image. And I feel like podcasting has like a very neutral to negative connotation. That's true. That's true. It's like every millennial has their podcast. Yeah. So I'm
[00:07:57.200] 感觉播客给人一种特定的印象。我觉得播客这个词带有一种非常中性甚至负面的含义。没错，没错。感觉每个千禧一代都有自己的播客。是啊。所以我……
[00:08:10.800] like, I don't want to be like, Oh, I have a podcast because I love this podcast. But I am fully aware that some people might be like, Oh, you're like one of those people, you know?
[00:08:10.800] 我不想给人一种感觉，比如“哦，我做播客是因为我喜欢这个播客”。但我完全明白有些人可能会想，“哦，你就是那种人，你知道吗？”
[00:08:20.400] Yeah, I feel like maybe almost there's a bit of that with music too. Because I don't know if you feel this way, Shang Wei, but I do feel like there was this wave of people around our age who would
[00:08:20.400] 是的，我觉得音乐界似乎也有点这种现象。尚伟，我不知道你是不是也有这种感觉，但我确实觉得在我们这个年龄段，曾经有一批人……
[00:08:31.440] like, get really into EDM and like raving. And then suddenly everyone wanted to be a DJ and like make music and stuff. And I feel like there's a bit of connotation behind that. Yeah, I definitely feel
[00:08:31.440] 比如，大家突然都迷上了电子舞曲，喜欢锐舞派对。然后突然之间，每个人都想当DJ，想做音乐什么的。我觉得这背后肯定有点深意。是的，我绝对有这种感觉。
[00:08:44.960] that. Whenever I mentioned music, they're like, Oh, so you DJ? And then I have to clarify like, oh, no, no, I actually don't know how to DJ. I just make music for fun. You're like, I was an
[00:08:44.960] 就是这样。每次我提到音乐，他们就会问：“哦，你是DJ吗？” 然后我就得解释说：“哦，不不，我其实不会DJ。我只是自己做音乐玩玩。” 你会觉得，我以前……
[00:08:56.080] OG. Like I made music before it was cool. Well, I do want to ask you guys because we did touch on a lot of different hobbies that we have. So how do you I guess, find these hobbies and commit your
[00:08:56.080] OG（元老级人物）。就像我在音乐流行之前就开始做音乐了。嗯，我想问问大家，因为我们聊了很多不同的爱好。那么，你们是怎么找到这些爱好并坚持下去的呢？
[00:09:10.160] time and your life to well not life but like a little bit of your lifestyle to these hobbies? That's a good question. And honestly, I don't know. Now that is like this question has been
[00:09:10.160] 时间和你的生活，嗯，不是生活的全部，而是你生活方式中的一部分，用来发展这些爱好？这是个好问题。老实说，我不知道。这个问题一直都在。
[00:09:20.240] formed into words. I'm like, how do we find hobbies? I think one way that I can kind of pinpoint some hobbies is like, I go down some rabbit hole on YouTube. And then suddenly I'm
[00:09:20.240] 用文字表达出来。我就想，我们怎么才能找到爱好呢？我觉得我能确定自己爱好的一种方法是，我在YouTube上钻研，不知不觉就找到了。然后突然间，我就……
[00:09:32.240] like learning all this info about a specific topic. And then you know, it just seems so interesting. And then I end up spending more and more time researching slash doing that thing until
[00:09:32.240] 就像学习某个特定主题的所有信息一样。然后你知道，它看起来就很有趣。然后我最终会花越来越多的时间去研究/做这件事，直到……
[00:09:44.080] it becomes a hobby. So one example is like keyboards. There was like this huge wave of, you know, keyboard creators and like making the coolest, nicest sounding keyboard, the creamiest keyboard or whatever. And that's like definitely a YouTube rabbit hole that anyone
[00:09:44.080] 这会变成一种爱好。举个例子，比如键盘。曾经出现过一股键盘设计热潮，大家都在努力制作最酷炫、音色最棒、手感最顺滑的键盘等等。这绝对是一个让人深陷其中的YouTube无底洞，任何人都会沉迷其中。
[00:10:01.680] can fall down into. I had definitely found myself falling into that. And that's kind of how I personally got into keyboards for a while. Yeah, I can really resonate with that point. I also did
[00:10:01.680] 很容易陷入那种境地。我发现自己确实陷入过那种境地。我个人也是因为这个原因才有一段时间迷上了键盘。是的，我对此深有体会。我也这么做过。
[00:10:12.080] have a keyboard phase. And I think a lot of my interests come from whatever needs I have in the moment. So when I was moving to a new place, I wanted to revamp my setup. So naturally, I found
[00:10:12.080] 我曾经有一段时间特别迷键盘。我觉得我的很多兴趣都源于我当下的需求。所以当我搬到新地方的时候，我想重新布置一下我的设备。于是很自然地，我找到了
[00:10:24.000] a new monitor, new speakers outside of my keyboard. So I was researching that and I found out about mechanical keyboards and all the enthusiasts saying like, Oh, yeah, I want that thockiness or
[00:10:24.000] 我想要一台新显示器，还有键盘外面的新音箱。所以我就开始研究这些，然后我发现了机械键盘，还有那些爱好者们说：“哦，对，我想要那种沉闷的敲击感。”
[00:10:34.720] I want that certain key cap. I want a colorful or like just a really aesthetic looking keyboard. And just going down that rabbit hole. And back to the sewing point I initially said,
[00:10:34.720] 我想要那个特定的键帽。我想要一个色彩鲜艳或者外观非常漂亮的键盘。然后我就一头扎进了这个话题。回到我最初提到的缝纫问题，
[00:10:47.680] Yeah, I was out of more necessity. I just didn't want to pay like 20 bucks to him. I made the mistake of starting with hemming my shirts, which is really fluffy. So I was really frustrated.
[00:10:47.680] 是啊，我当时是迫不得已。我就是不想花那二十块钱给他。我犯了个错，先让他帮我缝衬衫的下摆，结果弄得衬衫毛茸茸的。所以我当时特别郁闷。
[00:10:59.920] I'd like him it, it'll get caught in the machine and almost tear the shirt. It was like not really beginner friendly. But I think it gave me the skills to start any sewing projects I do want
[00:10:59.920] 我想把它给他，但它会卡在机器里，差点把衬衫撕破。这件衣服对新手不太友好。不过我觉得它给了我一些缝纫技巧，以后我想做的任何缝纫项目都能上手了。
[00:11:10.480] to start. And again, out of necessity, I lost my climbing bag on a camping trip. I left it on top of my car. And I drove off without it. And it fell on the freeway. And it just it just gone. So now
[00:11:10.480] 事情是这样的。再说一遍，因为实在没办法，我在一次露营旅行中弄丢了我的登山包。我把它放在车顶上，然后就开车走了。结果它掉在了高速公路上，就这么不见了。所以现在
[00:11:24.240] I want to, you know, hopefully so a little climbing bag is pretty approachable. But aside from like falling into rabbit holes, I also find a lot of hobbies from my friends. I got a lot of my
[00:11:24.240] 我希望，你知道，最好是那种小巧的攀岩包，这样比较容易上手。除了沉迷于各种爱好之外，我也从朋友那里学到了很多其他爱好。我的很多爱好都来自朋友。
[00:11:37.120] interest from Eugene actually shout out to him. He got me into making music. We had a skating phase during COVID. Yeah, I think just seeing friends and finding out about their interests really
[00:11:37.120] 尤金的关注真的让我很感动。是他带我入了音乐圈。疫情期间我们一起玩滑板。是啊，我觉得能见到朋友，了解他们的兴趣爱好真的很有帮助。
[00:11:48.640] motivates me and find the passion into it because seeing them enjoy it kind of ignites something in me. It's just fun when my friends can show me interesting things to get into. Yeah, I can
[00:11:48.640] 看到他们乐在其中，我内心也燃起了热情，这激励着我不断前进。朋友们能带我体验各种有趣的事物，真的太棒了。是的，我可以。
[00:12:00.160] totally relate to that too. I feel like a lot of things that I'm inspired by my life, it definitely comes from like my close social circle. So even some of the hobbies that I mentioned earlier,
[00:12:00.160] 我也完全有同感。我觉得我生活中很多灵感来源，都来自我亲密的社交圈。所以，甚至包括我之前提到的一些爱好，
[00:12:10.640] like golf, I grew up playing that with my family. So then it was something that I kind of went back to because I had so many positive memories with it. And then reading as well. My dad is a huge
[00:12:10.640] 就像高尔夫一样，我从小就和家人一起打。所以后来我又重新拾起了这项运动，因为它承载了我很多美好的回忆。还有阅读。我爸爸是个十足的读者。
[00:12:21.280] reader. So Crystal, a couple episodes ago, you mentioned that your brother was a huge reader. And that's why you were inspired to read. Same thing for me as well with my dad. So I think a
[00:12:21.280] 读者。所以克丽丝塔尔，几期节目前你提到你哥哥是个书虫，所以你才开始读书。我的情况也一样，我爸爸也是个书虫。所以我觉得……
[00:12:29.920] lot of things do come more naturally from seeing close people do it. But one interesting thought that I had recently was, I feel like after I started working, I realized that I needed to have
[00:12:29.920] 很多事情确实会因为看到身边的人去做而变得更加自然。但我最近想到一个有趣的问题：我觉得开始工作后，我意识到我需要拥有
[00:12:41.440] some more like safe for work hobbies, in a sense, like things that you could talk about, like, oh, I did this last weekend. That doesn't involve just being like, oh, I hung out with my friends.
[00:12:41.440] 有些爱好更像是适合工作场合的，比如你可以谈论的事情，像“哦，我上周末做了这个”。这不仅仅是说“哦，我和朋友们出去玩了”。
[00:12:51.600] So then I feel like pickleball definitely counts as one of those things. I was like, oh, it's on the rise, easy access at my gym. And it just gives you something to like talk about at work. So I
[00:12:51.600] 所以我觉得匹克球绝对算得上是其中之一。我当时就想，哦，它现在很流行，而且在我的健身房就能轻松玩。它还能让你在工作时有话题可聊。所以
[00:13:02.720] feel like it's something that I default to a lot when people are like, how was your weekend? I'm like, pickleball. Oh my god, so true. I feel like at work, Mondays and Tuesdays, the conversation I
[00:13:02.720] 感觉当别人问我“周末过得怎么样？”的时候，我经常会脱口而出“打匹克球”。天哪，太对了。感觉在工作的时候，周一和周二，大家聊到匹克球的时候，我都会说这个。
[00:13:15.040] dread the most, like not even work itself, but it's like, hey, how was your weekend? Oh, I'm gonna tell them I did nothing this weekend again. I know. I'm like, I can't say I binge 12 hours of
[00:13:15.040] 最让我害怕的，甚至不是工作本身，而是那种被问到“嘿，你周末过得怎么样？”的时候。哦，我又要跟他们说我这个周末什么都没做。我知道。我心想，我总不能说我连续12个小时狂刷手机吧。
[00:13:27.520] love. I like this weekend. Like I need something else to talk about. Yeah, it's always a relief when I can say something like, oh, yeah, like my friends and I went and played pickleball or like
[00:13:27.520] 爱。我喜欢这个周末。好像我还需要别的话题似的。是啊，能说点什么总是让人松一口气，比如，哦，对了，我和朋友们去打匹克球了，或者……
[00:13:37.680] it was someone's birthday. So I celebrated with my friends. Like nice. I seem like I have a life now. At work, do they ever ask you to share pictures of your weekend? Like our team has been trying
[00:13:37.680] 那天是某人的生日，所以我跟朋友们一起庆祝了。真好。感觉我现在的生活也挺充实的。在公司，他们会问你周末的照片吗？就像我们团队最近一直在问的那样。
[00:13:52.720] to do that too. Since most of our team is remote, they want to promote more connection within the team. So they just have like a thread of pictures. And maybe that's where all the family people,
[00:13:52.720] 他们也想这样做。因为我们团队的大部分成员都是远程办公，所以他们想促进团队内部的联系。因此，他们建了一个图片分享帖。也许所有家庭成员都在那里。
[00:14:03.920] family oriented people are posting their pictures. But for me, I just can't get myself to share anything. Or like it's not work friendly to share. Like if I'm going to a friend's kickback, I can't really share those pictures. You're like posting your win and VP.
[00:14:03.920] 重视家庭的人都在晒照片。但我就是没办法分享任何东西。或者说，分享照片不太适合工作场合。比如，如果我去参加朋友的聚会，我不太好意思分享那些照片。你就像是在晒你的胜利和副总统头衔一样。
[00:14:23.680] Wow, I my work has definitely never asked us to do that. But we do have like hobby slack threads. And then there's like a gardening channel and like a pets channel and stuff. And people always post
[00:14:23.680] 哇，我们公司肯定从来没要求过我们这么做。不过我们确实有一些兴趣爱好相关的Slack群组。还有园艺频道、宠物频道之类的。大家经常会发帖。
[00:14:35.520] photos of their life. And I'm always like, wow, I don't know. What will it take for me to one day feel comfortable enough to do that? You know? Yeah. I think when my team asks for photos,
[00:14:35.520] 他们的生活照片。我总是想，哇，我不知道。我什么时候才能自在地拍下这些照片呢？你知道吗？嗯。我觉得当我的团队要求拍照的时候，
[00:14:47.040] the most is usually when someone goes traveling. And then you know, they take like a week off or something. And then it's like, share pictures while you're gone or like share pictures of your
[00:14:47.040] 最常见的情况通常是有人去旅行。你知道，他们会休假一周左右。然后就会有人分享旅行期间的照片，或者分享他们旅行的照片。
[00:14:57.520] pets. You know, those are like the two most common picture requests. That's a tough one, though. Because some people I feel like I don't take a ton of photos myself. But my husband James,
[00:14:57.520] 宠物。你知道，这是最常见的两种拍照要求。不过，这确实是个难题。因为我觉得我自己其实不太爱拍照。但我的丈夫詹姆斯，
[00:15:08.560] he like rarely takes photos. Like if you go on his photos app on his phone and scroll once, it's like 2018 already. Like that's how few photos he takes. So I'm like, then you have to
[00:15:08.560] 他几乎不怎么拍照。你打开他手机上的照片应用，随便翻一下，就看到2018年的照片了。他拍的照片就是这么少。所以我就想，那你肯定得……
[00:15:20.480] remember to take pictures of these things, you know? Oh my God. Yeah. So like one time I went on a trip and it was a solo trip too. And I was like, oh my God, my team has been asking.
[00:15:20.480] 记得要拍这些东西的照片，你知道吗？我的天哪。是啊。有一次我独自一人去旅行。然后我就想，我的天哪，我的团队一直在问我。
[00:15:29.840] Don't forget to take photos. And I was like, okay, like I will have to make it like an effort to take photos when normally I'm like not the type of person to take photos, let alone photos of myself.
[00:15:29.840] 别忘了拍照。我当时就想，好吧，看来我得努力去拍照了，而我平时根本不是那种会拍照的人，更别说自拍了。
[00:15:42.000] That's like the biggest thing I don't do. And then usually it's like if I am traveling with friends, then they'll take the photos. So this time I was like, oh my God, like I actually have
[00:15:42.000] 那几乎是我最不擅长的事情。通常情况下，如果我和朋友一起旅行，他们就会帮我拍照。所以这次我就想，天哪，我居然要自己拍照。
[00:15:51.040] to be like, okay, that looks cool. I guess I can take a photo of it just so I can share it for my coworkers. Dude, I'm just imagining your camera roll is just like screenshots of your train
[00:15:51.040] 感觉就像，嗯，这看起来挺酷的。我想我可以拍张照片，然后分享给同事们。哥们儿，我感觉你的手机相册里全是火车的截图。
[00:15:59.600] tickets and shit. Like no actual photos. Wait, that would have been genius. Oh my God. But I do kind of want to ask you guys about the idea of a hobby portfolio,
[00:15:59.600] 票根之类的。没有照片。等等，要是真有照片就好了。我的天。不过我确实想问问你们关于兴趣爱好作品集的想法，
[00:16:12.080] which I think I kind of briefly alluded to earlier. I feel like every hobby can be categorized into an energizing hobby or a relaxing one or a creative one, or maybe even a social one.
[00:16:12.080] 我觉得我之前好像也稍微提过这一点。我觉得每一种爱好都可以归类为充满活力的爱好、放松身心的爱好、创造性的爱好，甚至是社交爱好。
[00:16:24.480] So do you guys like to kind of vary out your hobby portfolio to land in each category? Or is this not something you like naturally think about? Personally, it's not something I'm consciously
[00:16:24.480] 所以你们会刻意丰富自己的兴趣爱好，以涵盖各个类别吗？还是说你们根本不会刻意去想这个问题？就我个人而言，我并没有刻意去考虑过这个问题。
[00:16:37.360] doing, but I do see a benefit of having that. For example, when I used to work out and make music, those were my primary hobbies. It was like really tiring after work, especially for music,
[00:16:37.360] 确实如此，但我确实看到了它的好处。例如，以前我健身和做音乐的时候，那是我的主要爱好。下班后真的很累，尤其是做音乐的时候。
[00:16:50.640] the technical aspects and creative aspects. It was really draining when my brain was already like ready to turn off. And right after work, especially when I wasn't remote, the traffic back was really tiring, even though it was only like maybe a 30 minute commute. Then going to the gym,
[00:16:50.640] 技术方面和创意方面都让我筋疲力尽。我的大脑已经快要停止运转了，但工作仍然让我精疲力竭。而且下班后，尤其是不在远程办公的时候，即使通勤时间只有30分钟左右，回家的路上也让人非常疲惫。然后还要去健身房，
[00:17:06.880] I probably need a nap before I do that or take some pre-workout. And after that, I probably want to relax, but I would also feel guilty not doing something because I only have
[00:17:06.880] 我可能需要先小睡一会儿，或者吃点运动前补剂。之后，我可能想放松一下，但如果什么都不做，我又会觉得内疚，因为我只有……
[00:17:17.280] so many hours before the next work day. And since my hobby was making music, I was both physically drained and mentally drained. So I just didn't get much done during those periods of time. So having
[00:17:17.280] 距离下一个工作日还有好几个小时。由于我的爱好是创作音乐，我身心俱疲。所以在那段时间里，我几乎什么都没做。因此，
[00:17:29.520] like a relaxing hobby would have really benefited that period. But sometimes like hobbies can double as like both social and energizing. Like working out can be energizing if you're with friends, you're hyping each other up. You're also working towards the goal you set for yourself. So I think
[00:17:29.520] 比如，如果当时能培养一些轻松的爱好，那段时间肯定会很有帮助。但有时候，爱好也能兼具社交和激励的双重作用。比如，和朋友一起锻炼就能让人精神焕发，大家互相鼓励，共同朝着自己设定的目标努力。所以我觉得
[00:17:44.880] having those combinations is really great. And I think currently climbing does that for me. I can hang out with my friends. We can talk about the problem or even catch up during that time. Or
[00:17:44.880] 拥有这些组合真的太棒了。我觉得攀岩目前就给了我这种体验。我可以和朋友们一起玩。我们可以讨论攀岩路线，或者趁机聊聊天。
[00:17:55.680] sometimes we just want to lock in and get the send and just be super concentrated, just climbing well. Yeah, that's a good point. I do feel like a lot of hobbies can be multi-purpose, like you
[00:17:55.680] 有时候我们只想全神贯注，顺利完成攀登，集中精力，好好地爬上去。嗯，你说得对。我觉得很多爱好都可以一物多用，就像你一样。
[00:18:07.280] mentioned. I don't know if this is just me, but sometimes I struggle a little bit with social hobbies because you mentioned that there are times where you just want to be quiet and focused.
[00:18:07.280] 提到了。我不知道是不是只有我这样，但有时候我不太喜欢社交类的爱好，因为你也提到过，有时候你只想安静地专注。
[00:18:17.680] And then other times it's more of like a social thing. And these two things can happen around the same hobby with the same people. It just depends on the day. But for me, I feel like sometimes I
[00:18:17.680] 有时候，它更像是一种社交活动。这两种情况都可能发生在同一个爱好和同一群人之间。这完全取决于当天的情况。但对我来说，我觉得有时候我
[00:18:28.080] want to socialize and sometimes I don't. And then if I have to be around people when I don't want to socialize, I'm like, oh my god, this is super draining in itself. So I feel like even with my
[00:18:28.080] 我有时想社交，有时又不想。如果我不想社交却不得不待在人群里，我就会觉得，天哪，这本身就超级累人。所以我觉得即使我
[00:18:38.400] social hobbies, for example, playing board games, sometimes I literally just buy the board game app on my phone and then just play it by myself. And it's super relaxing to me. So I guess in a way,
[00:18:38.400] 例如，社交爱好，比如玩桌游，有时候我直接在手机上买桌游app，然后自己玩。这对我来说超级放松。所以我想从某种意义上说，
[00:18:50.160] it's indulging in different aspects of the same hobby. I think you're both right in that. You can change up a hobby and one of the easiest factors is adding people into it. Suddenly, this workout isn't just an internal thing. It's like a social thing now. And it's
[00:18:50.160] 这就像是在同一个爱好中体验不同的方面。我觉得你们俩说的都对。你可以改变一个爱好，而最简单的方法之一就是让其他人参与进来。突然间，锻炼就不再只是你自己的事情了，它变成了一种社交活动。而且，
[00:19:08.320] because of that maybe a little more energizing. Board games slash games, you could definitely play something by yourself, but you could also add the element of friends and that kind of changes
[00:19:08.320] 正因如此，或许会更有活力。桌游之类的游戏，你当然可以独自玩，但也可以加入朋友的元素，这样就会产生各种变化。
[00:19:19.040] the vibes a bit. I guess in the idea of the hobby portfolio, I don't necessarily separate them into what is the relaxing hobby, what is the energizing hobby. I think I almost separate it more like
[00:19:19.040] 感觉有点像。我想，在构思爱好组合的时候，我并不一定把它们区分成哪些是放松的爱好，哪些是充满活力的爱好。我觉得我更像是这样划分的：
[00:19:32.560] what is the solo hobby versus what is the social hobby. Yeah, it's so interesting. The more we talk about it because I'm realizing that each of my hobbies can be both solo or group and then
[00:19:32.560] 独处爱好和社交爱好有什么区别？是啊，这很有意思。我们聊得越多，我越意识到我的每项爱好都可以是独处或集体进行的。
[00:19:45.840] also can be energizing or relaxing. For example, if you want to be social while playing golf, you go play a course with your friends. But if I want to be in my solitude era,
[00:19:45.840] 也可以让人精神焕发或放松身心。例如，如果你想在打高尔夫球的同时进行社交活动，你可以和朋友们一起去球场。但如果我想享受独处的时光，
[00:19:58.320] I feel like I could just go to the range by myself. Or even for reading, I feel like that's very much classified as a stay at home and enjoy book on the couch kind of a hobby. But I also have
[00:19:58.320] 我觉得我可以一个人去靶场。或者就读书而言，我觉得那完全属于那种宅在家里，窝在沙发上看书的爱好。但我也有……
[00:20:09.120] a book club where we like to meet up and have a fun night together while discussing the book we read recently. So I guess it's not so much like a hobby portfolio, but more of knowing
[00:20:09.120] 我们是一个读书俱乐部，喜欢聚在一起，一边讨论最近读过的书，一边度过一个愉快的夜晚。所以我觉得它与其说是一个兴趣爱好合集，不如说是一个知识库。
[00:20:20.080] what you can take and what kind of benefits you want from each hobby depending on the day and the mood you're feeling. Yeah, that's a good point. Do you have any hobbies where it's purely just
[00:20:20.080] 你可以根据当天的心情和状态，选择适合自己的爱好，并从中获得不同的益处。嗯，你说得对。你有没有什么爱好纯粹是为了娱乐？
[00:20:30.960] with people? Because right now it just sparked a thought in my head. I wouldn't consider any of my current hobbies a hobby if I wouldn't enjoy it doing it alone. I guess pickleball would be
[00:20:30.960] 和别人一起？因为我突然想到，如果我一个人做某件事都觉得没意思，那我就不会把现在的爱好称为爱好。我想匹克球应该算吧。
[00:20:43.680] considered something that I would not be able to do by myself. I think there's like good one. Yeah, like net setups or like wall setups or something where you can kind of do it. But
[00:20:43.680] 我考虑过一些我自己做不到的事情。我觉得应该有比较好的方法。比如搭建网状结构或者墙壁结构之类的，你可以自己动手。
[00:20:53.040] I feel like the nature of this sport, you do kind of have to have at least a partner that you can sort of play with. So that's probably a purely social one. I think actually, like for me,
[00:20:53.040] 我觉得这项运动的性质决定了你至少需要一个搭档一起玩。所以这可能纯粹是一项社交运动。我觉得实际上，对我来说，
[00:21:04.560] golf is more social than solo. I think the only times it's solo is like going to the range. I don't like going to the range as much as I like playing on a course. And playing on a course,
[00:21:04.560] 高尔夫更多的是社交活动，而不是独自一人。我觉得只有在练习场打球的时候才是独自一人。我不太喜欢去练习场，我更喜欢在球场上打球。而在球场上打球，
[00:21:16.480] I feel like I always want at least one person with me. Yeah, that makes sense. I think there's another hobby that I have that is like uniquely social sometimes. So like I'm kind of into wine,
[00:21:16.480] 我总觉得身边至少要有一个人陪着。嗯，这很合理。我觉得我还有另一个爱好，有时候也挺需要社交的。比如说，我挺喜欢葡萄酒的，
[00:21:28.480] and I feel like yes, you could be into wine like solo, but then you're just like there by yourself drinking like wine, right? And I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. But I think the fun part
[00:21:28.480] 我觉得，是的，你可以独自一人享受葡萄酒，但那样的话，你就只是一个人在那里喝酒，对吧？我的意思是，这没什么错。但我认为乐趣在于……
[00:21:40.640] about this like, quote unquote hobby is when you like get some friends together and you're like, hey, let's fuck around and say like, Oh, what am I tasting from this wine? None of us really know
[00:21:40.640] 关于这种所谓的“爱好”，就是你和几个朋友聚在一起，然后说：“嘿，咱们瞎玩儿吧，然后说，‘哦，我这酒里尝到了什么味道？’我们谁也说不准。”
[00:21:51.360] what we're talking about. We're just like shooting the shit and like having fun. Yeah, that's a really good point. Because I feel like especially indulging in stuff like food or drinks is just so
[00:21:51.360] 我们现在聊的就是这些。我们只是闲聊，开心一下。嗯，你说得很有道理。因为我觉得，尤其是在吃吃喝喝的时候，真的太……
[00:22:00.320] much better of an experience when you're sharing it with people. And also other people's opinions on whatever you're eating or drinking can often influence your thoughts on it too. So I can
[00:22:00.320] 与人分享会是更好的体验。而且，别人对你吃喝的东西的看法通常也会影响你的想法。所以我可以
[00:22:11.920] definitely feel how that is like more of a social thing. Yeah, and I feel like with the right group of people and the right setting and whatever, it definitely can be energizing. And kind of like
[00:22:11.920] 确实感觉这更像是一种社交活动。是的，我觉得如果和合适的人在一起，在合适的场合，等等，那绝对会让人充满活力。有点像……
[00:22:23.440] you said, Shang Wei, a lot of hobbies can definitely be draining. Like they're fun for sure. But once you finish up, you're like, Oh, I'm actually very tired. And I wonder if there's any
[00:22:23.440] 尚伟，你说过很多爱好确实很耗费精力。它们当然很有趣，但结束后，你会觉得，哎呀，我其实很累。我想知道有没有什么……
[00:22:34.640] hobbies that you think tend to be a little more on the energizing side? Like maybe you still end up feeling tired towards the end when you wrap up. But like, while you're doing it, it's engaging,
[00:22:34.640] 你有没有觉得哪些爱好比较能让你精力充沛？比如，也许做完之后你还是会觉得累，但是做的时候却很投入，
[00:22:46.240] and it makes you more energized. I only have so many hobbies. But climbing, I always go back to that point. I feel that it's energizing in many ways, both on the social aspect. And also, you're
[00:22:46.240] 它能让你更有活力。我的爱好不多，但攀岩，我总是会回到这项运动。我觉得它在很多方面都能让人充满活力，包括社交方面。而且，你……
[00:23:01.280] just very in tune with your body. When you're on the wall, you have to be conscious of basically every end of your body, like from your fingertips to your toes, where you're placing your feet,
[00:23:01.280] 就是要非常了解自己的身体。在墙上练习的时候，你必须时刻注意身体的每一个部位，从指尖到脚趾，包括脚的位置。
[00:23:11.200] your hip and your head position. All of those can affect how you feel on the wall, whether you're like falling off or if you can reach the next move. So it really helps being in tune with your body,
[00:23:11.200] 你的臀部和头部位置。所有这些都会影响你在墙上的感觉，决定你是会掉下来还是能完成下一个动作。所以，了解自己的身体状况真的很有帮助。
[00:23:22.560] and just being conscious of kind of everything that's going on. And I think that in itself is kind of like a meditative process. Like once you get into that mode, you're kind of in like a flow
[00:23:22.560] 就是要时刻留意周围发生的一切。我觉得这本身就有点像冥想。一旦你进入那种状态，你就会进入一种心流状态。
[00:23:33.840] state where you just listen to your body and you can do what's next. But it doesn't always happen that way. It's kind of hard to get into that flow state. If I'm learning a new move, like something
[00:23:33.840] 那种状态就是你只需要倾听身体的感受，然后就能自然而然地做出下一步动作。但这种情况并非总是如此。进入那种心流状态其实很难。比如，如果我在学习一个新动作，像……
[00:23:44.880] with a new coordination, I might just be flopping all over the place. But that in itself is really fun too. You're learning something new. You might look goofy and your friends might clown you.
[00:23:44.880] 有了新的协调能力，我可能就会笨手笨脚、跌跌撞撞。但这本身也很有趣。你在学习新东西。你可能会看起来很傻，你的朋友可能会取笑你。
[00:23:55.280] But that adds to more of the energy and everyone's learning together. So that's something I really enjoy about climbing. After the session, if it's been a good session, I learned something new or
[00:23:55.280] 但这有助于激发更多活力，让大家一起学习。这就是我真正喜欢攀岩的原因。每次攀岩结束后，如果感觉不错，我都能学到一些新东西。
[00:24:05.200] I sense something I've been working on. I just feel really elated after the session. And sometimes I just walk back smiling or sometimes I'm just maybe a little down. But I think the adrenaline
[00:24:05.200] 我感觉自己一直在努力的事情有了进展。每次疗程结束后，我都感觉特别兴奋。有时候我会面带微笑地走回去，有时候可能也会有点沮丧。但我认为这都和肾上腺素有关。
[00:24:17.120] really helps keep me feel energized during and after the session. I like what you said about learning something new. I think that's actually a key point now that I'm reflecting on it. If I'm
[00:24:17.120] 这真的能帮助我在训练期间和训练后都保持精力充沛。我很喜欢你说的学习新知识这一点。现在回想起来，我觉得这确实是一个关键点。如果我
[00:24:29.680] learning something while I'm engaging in a hobby, it's reaching goals. And every time you reach a goal or accomplish something, it's like a burst of energy. So I'm probably going to do a bad job
[00:24:29.680] 在从事爱好的同时学习东西，就是达成目标。每次达成目标或完成某件事，都像是一股能量爆发。所以，我可能做得不好。
[00:24:41.200] recalling this, but I read some sort of article that said learning to do new things or teaching your body to do new things creates new neural pathways in your brain. So then it is stimulating
[00:24:41.200] 我记得看过一篇文章，说学习新事物或者训练身体适应新事物会在大脑中建立新的神经通路。所以，这确实具有刺激作用。
[00:24:55.760] not only just physically, but also literally in your brain and for your brain, which I find really interesting. But I think what you said, Shengwei, about trying to engage every cell of
[00:24:55.760] 不仅是身体上的，而且是真正地作用于你的大脑，为了你的大脑，我觉得这很有意思。但我认为你刚才说的，盛伟，关于尝试调动每一个细胞……
[00:25:08.080] your body to do that sport definitely reminds me of reaching flow state in the gym. I don't know. I think I'm just late to this, but in the past year or two, I feel like I've been really learning
[00:25:08.080] 你的身体能做到这项运动，确实让我想起了在健身房达到心流状态的感觉。我不知道。我可能有点后知后觉，但在过去一两年里，我感觉自己真的学到了很多。
[00:25:20.880] what mind-body connection is. Teaching my brain to feel parts of my body that I don't constantly engage is such a weird feeling. And I feel like that is what is the most energizing to me. Things
[00:25:20.880] 身心连接究竟是什么？训练我的大脑去感受那些我平时不怎么用到的身体部位，这种感觉真是太奇妙了。我觉得这才是最能让我充满活力的。
[00:25:35.760] like pickleball and golf I find very fun, but honestly at the end of a game or end of an 18-hole or something, I'm always very drained. But for a workout at the gym where it's just me and myself,
[00:25:35.760] 像匹克球和高尔夫，我觉得都很有趣，但说实话，每次打完一局或者打完18洞之后，我都会感觉筋疲力尽。但如果是在健身房独自锻炼，
[00:25:48.320] I'm trying to get all the postures and shit right, something about that is very energizing. So I guess in some ways, hobbies like pickleball and golf are still physical and fun, but to me,
[00:25:48.320] 我正在努力把所有姿势都练对，这感觉很让人充满活力。所以我想，从某种程度上来说，像匹克球和高尔夫这样的爱好仍然是运动性的，也很有趣，但对我来说，
[00:25:59.120] it's not as energizing as something like going to the gym. I think there's something really special about physical hobbies, especially working out. It's very personalized to your own proportions and your own weaknesses and strengths. If you reflect back a couple of years or even just a
[00:25:59.120] 它不像去健身房那样令人精神振奋。我认为体育爱好，尤其是健身，有着非常特别的魅力。它非常个性化，可以根据你的身材比例、自身弱点和优势来制定。如果你回想几年前，或者哪怕只是……
[00:26:15.360] couple months, you're probably doing something that you couldn't have done before and it's really validating. I think that applies to all other sports as well. If you improve your form, you're way more efficient than before. Or with golf, actually I don't know too much about golf,
[00:26:15.360] 几个月后，你可能就能做到以前做不到的事情，这真的很有成就感。我认为这也适用于所有其他运动。如果你改进了动作，你的效率就会比以前高得多。或者像高尔夫，其实我对高尔夫了解不多。
[00:26:31.200] but the swing just feels right. Yeah, I feel like you're both so right about if you're doing something and you can literally see the improvement and or feel it. Yeah, usually it's something that's more physical, so going to the gym or doing some sort of sport or whatever.
[00:26:31.200] 但挥杆的感觉就是对了。是啊，我觉得你们俩说的都对，如果你在做某件事，而且你能真切地看到或感受到进步，那就说明你进步了。通常来说，这跟一些体能训练比较有关，比如去健身房或者参加某种运动之类的。
[00:26:51.360] Kind of like what I said earlier, having these goals and accomplishments in this hobby, I think is just super energizing because I think it's also different from work because work or school or whatever, you're doing these tasks and accomplishing these things
[00:26:51.360] 就像我之前说的，在这个爱好中设定目标并取得成就，我觉得非常令人振奋，因为它和工作不一样。工作、学习或其他任何事情，你都在忙着完成各种任务和目标。
[00:27:10.400] not necessarily always for yourself. Sometimes it's like, oh, I just have to do this because that's a task that I have. I have to do this homework whether I like it or not.
[00:27:10.400] 不一定总是为了自己。有时候会想，哦，我必须做这件事，因为这是我的任务。不管我喜不喜欢，我都必须完成这项作业。
[00:27:20.880] But then a hobby is truly like, I like this thing so I want to improve. Then I think that's where the excitement, the motivation comes from it all. I can actually relate to this in sometimes in
[00:27:20.880] 但真正的爱好应该是这样的：我喜欢这件事，所以我想提升自己。我觉得这就是兴奋点和动力的来源。有时候我也能体会到这一点。
[00:27:36.960] games. At first it starts out like, oh, this game is fun, I'm going to play it. Then you're like, oh, you know what? I think I can improve in this game. You start to research about it or read up
[00:27:36.960] 游戏。一开始你会觉得，哦，这个游戏挺好玩的，我要玩玩。然后你会想，哦，你知道吗？我觉得我玩这个游戏还能进步。于是你开始研究或者阅读相关资料。
[00:27:48.720] on it and then implement these practices in your gameplay. Then that's just literally for the love of the game as they say. Yeah, and I feel like there's something so gratifying about seeing what
[00:27:48.720] 先研究一下，然后把这些技巧运用到你的游戏中。那样的话，就真的纯粹是为了热爱游戏了，就像他们说的那样。是的，我觉得看到……真的很有成就感。
[00:28:02.960] our body can achieve. Sometimes it is in a more physical sense like working out or seeing what we could do on games. But I feel like sometimes it can also come in the form of the creative aspects
[00:28:02.960] 我们的身体能够做到的事情。有时这体现在更偏向身体层面的方面，比如锻炼或在游戏中挑战极限。但我感觉有时它也可以体现在创造性的方面。
[00:28:16.080] as well. Recently I went to my friend's birthday thing and she had a little girl's night for her birthday, gifted each of us a plushie crochet kit. All of us kind of sat around. It was most of
[00:28:16.080] 最近我去参加了我朋友的生日聚会，她办了个女生之夜，送给我们每人一套毛绒玩具钩织工具包。我们都围坐在一起。大部分时间……
[00:28:27.440] our first times we were like watching the little instruction videos and like catching up and attempting to crochet. At first it was like lively and shit and then like 20 minutes into the night it was just like silent and we were just each like concentrating so much on crocheting.
[00:28:27.440] 我们第一次尝试的时候，就像是在看一些教学视频，一边学习一边尝试钩针编织。一开始还挺热闹的，但过了大概20分钟，就突然安静下来了，我们都全神贯注地投入到钩针编织中。
[00:28:42.160] After I crocheted like a little section of it, I just felt so proud of what I made even though it's just like a couple of knots or some shit. I don't know, I think it's hard to find things
[00:28:42.160] 我钩了一小段之后，就对自己的作品感到非常自豪，即使它只是几个结之类的东西。我不知道，我觉得找到这样的东西很难。
[00:28:54.240] that make us very very proud sometimes in the day-to-day when emotions can be more dulled. You're just trying to get through the week but sometimes joy comes in like very simple forms like seeing
[00:28:54.240] 有时候，在日常生活中，当情绪变得麻木的时候，一些小事会让我们感到无比自豪。你只是想努力熬过这一周，但有时快乐会以非常简单的形式出现，比如看到……
[00:29:05.040] what we can make after like 20 minutes of watching crochet videos. Dude, I've heard those crochet plushies are hard as hell too. Dude, it's hella hard. I've seen so many videos of people are like
[00:29:05.040] 我们看了大概20分钟的钩针视频就能做出来的东西。哥们，我听说钩毛绒玩具也难得要死。哥们，真的太难了。我看过好多视频，里面的人都像这样……
[00:29:16.400] what it's supposed to look like, what I created and it's just like a blob and it's like indented somehow. So I mean props for you for getting some of it done. Yeah it lays unfinished in my drawer
[00:29:16.400] 它原本应该是什么样子，我做出来的东西现在就像一团乱麻，而且还凹凸不平。所以，我得夸夸你完成了一部分。是啊，它现在还躺在我的抽屉里没完成呢。
[00:29:29.840] but for those 20 minutes I was in bliss. You were in flow state. But I do kind of want to talk about flow state because we already mentioned it a little bit and I guess like maybe we should define it
[00:29:29.840] 但那二十分钟我简直如痴如醉。你当时处于心流状态。不过我确实想聊聊心流状态，因为我们之前稍微提了一下，我想或许我们应该给它下一个定义。
[00:29:45.360] first. This is actually a term that I came to learn more about in the recent years. What it essentially means, it's a state where you're so in tuned or engaged in the activity that you're doing
[00:29:45.360] 首先，这实际上是我近几年才开始深入了解的一个术语。它本质上是指一种你全神贯注于正在进行的活动的状态。
[00:30:00.240] that you're just like a god at the moment of like what you're doing right? So like I guess colloquially it's like you're in the zone and you're just at peak performance. So for an example
[00:30:00.240] 感觉就像你在做某件事的时候，就像神一样，对吧？所以，通俗地说，就像你进入了“心流”状态，达到了巅峰表现。举个例子
[00:30:12.400] if you think of like sports professional players like NBA someone is just like knocking down every single shot in the game. They're in the zone, they're like pretty much in flow state. So do
[00:30:12.400] 想想那些职业运动员，比如NBA球员，他们好像每场比赛都能投进每一个球。他们进入了状态，几乎完全进入了心流状态。所以，
[00:30:23.360] you think there's any hobbies that bring about the either possibility or just like even straight up like flow state out of yourself? For hobbies that I just get started in I have a really hard time of
[00:30:23.360] 你觉得有没有什么爱好能让你更容易进入心流状态，或者直接让你进入那种状态？我刚开始接触的爱好，往往很难让我进入心流状态。
[00:30:36.080] getting into the flow state because there's so much to learn, so many questions, a lot of doubt or like is this am I doing this right? Does this feel right? This feels very foreign but once you
[00:30:36.080] 进入心流状态是因为要学习的东西太多，问题太多，有很多疑虑，比如我这样做对吗？这种感觉对吗？这感觉很陌生，但一旦你进入心流状态……
[00:30:47.040] put in more like practice and time I think that can be in any hobby. So with climbing again when I first started it was a struggle. I felt so heavy but after learning you know different techniques
[00:30:47.040] 我觉得任何爱好都需要投入更多的时间和精力去练习。所以，我重新开始攀岩的时候也很艰难，感觉身体很沉重。但是学习了不同的技巧之后，我就掌握了这些技巧。
[00:30:58.640] and how to really move my body I can get into the flow state when I can finally clear my head and I think for me when I'm able to just stop thinking and doubting like oh is this too hard or is this
[00:30:58.640] 以及如何真正地活动我的身体，当我能够彻底清空思绪，进入心流状态时，对我来说，当我能够停止思考和怀疑，比如“哦，这会不会太难了”或者“这是否合适”的时候，我就能进入心流状态。
[00:31:12.800] move too reachy? Like do I have to jump for this? Like what do I do once all those thoughts clear out in my head I'm able to get in more of a flow state and just listen to my body. It can act
[00:31:12.800] 动作是不是太勉强了？比如，我非得跳起来才能做到吗？等我脑子里所有这些想法都清空之后，我该怎么做才能进入心流状态，倾听身体的感受？它能做出反应。
[00:31:23.680] automatically because I've been climbing for a while and I have the practice from all the other climbs I've done before it kind of just comes out when I need to. For creative hobbies for me I feel
[00:31:23.680] 因为我攀岩已经有一段时间了，而且之前攀岩的经验也让我积累了不少技巧，所以需要的时候自然而然就能做到。对我来说，作为创意爱好，我觉得
[00:31:35.120] like that's even more rewarding when you get into that state. When I was making music a lot of times I would just have an idea and I'll be stuck in a loop or I would even have trouble just getting
[00:31:35.120] 当你进入那种状态时，你会觉得更有成就感。我以前做音乐的时候，很多时候我脑子里冒出一个想法，然后就陷入一个循环，甚至很难把它表达出来。
[00:31:45.840] the inspiration but there's like really rare moments like maybe one day in many many months where I have an idea and the ideas just keep on coming and it's one of the most rewarding feelings
[00:31:45.840] 灵感固然重要，但真正能让人灵感迸发的时刻却非常罕见，可能几个月才有一天，我会突然冒出一个想法，然后灵感就会源源不断地涌现，这是最令人满足的感觉之一。
[00:31:58.240] I felt from a hobby and when those moments happen the song kind of just creates itself. After I'm done with the session I just think to myself wow that song just finished by itself like
[00:31:58.240] 我感觉创作音乐源于我的爱好，当那些灵感迸发的时刻到来时，歌曲仿佛就自然而然地诞生了。每次创作结束后，我都会惊叹：哇，这首歌竟然自己完成了！
[00:32:09.120] I didn't really have to try too hard it just happened. Like most of my sessions are not like that I just sit there and I'm stuck in a loop I'm trying to add different things and it just sounds
[00:32:09.120] 我其实没怎么费力，就自然而然地做到了。不像我大多数时候那样，我只是坐在那里，陷入一个循环，试图添加不同的东西，但听起来却很怪异。
[00:32:18.480] really bad and I wake up the next morning saying like what did I even make but when I'm able to get into a flow state I just don't have any of those feelings in it's amazing. I wonder what it is
[00:32:18.480] 真的糟透了，第二天早上醒来我都会想，我到底做了些什么？但当我进入心流状态时，就完全没有这些感觉了，真是太神奇了。我想知道这是为什么。
[00:32:30.320] specifically that allows us to get into flow state because I think I've somewhat reached flow state in my hobbies before and usually it like comes and goes a little bit for me so like in
[00:32:30.320] 具体来说，这能让我们进入心流状态，因为我觉得我以前在爱好方面也曾达到过某种程度的心流状态，但通常对我来说，这种状态会时有时无，就像……
[00:32:43.120] pickleball too I feel like there's times where I'm the one serving and suddenly everything clicks and my body knows what to do and I'm getting like multiple points in a row and then something
[00:32:43.120] 打匹克球的时候，我也感觉有时候是我发球，突然间一切都顺畅了，我的身体好像知道该怎么做，然后我就能连得好几分，然后……
[00:32:54.480] happens and then I suddenly forget how to like swing the paddle and I've actually experienced okay this is a little stupid but I've experienced flow state while like cleaning before so like I sometimes like organize my kitchen cabinets and our bathroom cabinets and all of that
[00:32:54.480] 事情就是这样，然后我突然就忘了怎么挥桨了。其实我曾经有过这样的经历：好吧，这有点傻，但我以前在做清洁的时候体验过心流状态。比如，我有时候会整理厨房橱柜、浴室橱柜之类的。
[00:33:12.880] you know we'll go months with like me shoving Tupperware in like one of the cabinets I'm like oh nothing fucking fits like it's so annoying and then one day I'll just wake up with clarity of like
[00:33:12.880] 你知道，有时候几个月的时间里，我把特百惠的盒子塞进橱柜里，然后心想“哎呀，什么都放不下，真是烦死了”，然后有一天我突然就清醒了，明白了。
[00:33:20.880] I need these specifically shaped bins and this will improve my quality of life and I don't know like sometimes it really just feels like it comes to me and then leaves but I wonder if in a certain
[00:33:20.880] 我需要这种特定形状的垃圾桶，这会改善我的生活质量。有时候，这种想法就像突然出现又消失一样，我不知道是不是因为某种原因。
[00:33:33.920] way we're like triggering it or achieving it without even knowing maybe it's like because we're thinking about it all the time subconsciously and then finally like something clicks and then it comes to our consciousness and we're like all right it's gonna happen now I think of flow state
[00:33:33.920] 我们似乎在不知不觉中触发或实现了它，也许是因为我们一直在潜意识里思考它，然后最终就像灵光一闪，它进入了我们的意识，我们心想：好了，现在它要发生了。我想到了心流状态。
[00:33:51.440] almost as like you don't question anything like if it's happening you can't second guess yourself or else you'll pull yourself out of it you know you're like yeah this is just how it's gonna go
[00:33:51.440] 就好像你什么都不质疑似的，既然事情已经发生了，你就不能再犹豫，否则你会把自己拉回现实。你知道，你会想，是啊，事情就是这样。
[00:34:01.440] like Shengwei was saying like just listen to your body like just listen to whatever is happening don't question anything and just keep going forward I actually have reached flow state at work sometimes
[00:34:01.440] 就像盛伟说的那样，倾听你身体的感受，倾听正在发生的一切，不要质疑任何事情，继续前进。我有时在工作中确实能进入心流状态。
[00:34:12.960] so I do like graphic design so there's definitely you know times where I'm just making something and I'm like feeling super clunky like oh I guess I'll just like force this in and I guess it somehow
[00:34:12.960] 所以我确实喜欢平面设计，所以肯定会有那么一些时候，我在创作的时候会感觉特别笨拙，然后就想，哦，我猜我就硬着头皮把这个放进去吧，结果居然也行得通。
[00:34:23.840] works but then there's definitely moments where it's like oh yeah like everything is coming together so easily like I'm locked in right now like three hours fly by and then I'm like nice
[00:34:23.840] 确实有效，但也有那么一些时刻，感觉一切都进行得如此顺利，就像我完全沉浸其中，三个小时飞快过去，然后我就觉得很棒。
[00:34:34.240] like today was so productive it's weird I don't know what triggers it either for sure sometimes the creative juices are flowing sometimes they're not but I do think it's always very satisfying
[00:34:34.240] 今天效率特别高，真是奇怪。我也不知道是什么触发了这种状态，有时候灵感泉涌，有时候又没有，但我觉得无论怎样，这都很有成就感。
[00:34:44.880] to like hit that flow state but what I have noticed is like once you're out of the flow state you're very tired you're like oh whoa that actually took a lot out of me more than I realized
[00:34:44.880] 想要进入那种心流状态，但我注意到，一旦从心流状态中出来，就会非常疲惫，你会想：哇，这真的比我想象的要消耗我更多精力。
[00:34:56.000] it's interesting recently we went to a friend's birthday party and they hosted it kind of outdoors in like a picnic form so then people were playing spike ball and like throwing a football around and
[00:34:56.000] 最近挺有意思的，我们去参加一个朋友的生日派对，他们是在户外以野餐的形式举办的，所以大家玩弹珠游戏，还扔橄榄球之类的。
[00:35:08.000] etc. Crystal I don't know if you saw this but you and me and a couple of our other friends we were like chatting for a while and then I realized that James wasn't with us right so I turned around
[00:35:08.000] 等等。克丽丝塔尔，我不知道你有没有看到，你、我还有几个朋友聊了一会儿，然后我突然意识到詹姆斯不在我们身边，所以我就转过身去。
[00:35:18.560] and I see him and another friend of ours peppering like a spike ball so they were like doing this rhythmical pass of like one spike pass one spike pass like etc etc over and over and I was like oh
[00:35:18.560] 我看到他和我们另一个朋友像抛接球一样不停地传球，他们有节奏地传接传，一个接一个，如此反复，我就想，哦
[00:35:32.560] James like how long have you guys been doing that and he was like we've been doing this for 15 minutes they hadn't dropped the ball a single time wow and he was like I'm in flow state right now and I
[00:35:32.560] 詹姆斯问你们这样做多久了，他说我们已经这样做了15分钟了，他们一次都没出错，哇，然后他说我现在进入了心流状态。
[00:35:43.680] was just like what the fuck and it was so funny to me because you know when you yourself are in flow state right watching someone else in flow state was so weird because I was like what's wrong with your eyes like you're like in a faraway place
[00:35:43.680] 我当时就觉得“卧槽”，这对我来说太搞笑了，因为你知道，当你自己进入心流状态的时候，看着别人进入心流状态感觉很奇怪，我会想“你的眼神怎么了？好像神游天外一样”。
[00:36:01.440] and I just felt like it was I don't know almost like a visual representation of what flow state looks like it's just you're so concentrated it's almost like brain off and it's just your body
[00:36:01.440] 我感觉那就像，我不知道该怎么形容，几乎就像是心流状态的视觉呈现，你全神贯注，大脑几乎处于关闭状态，只剩下身体。
[00:36:11.200] moving but everything is just like perfect you know dude yeah it's almost like everything there is like instinctual and it's just like working yeah hearing you two talk about graphic design
[00:36:11.200] 虽然在搬家，但一切都完美得像模像样，你知道吗？是啊，感觉一切都像是本能反应，一切都顺理成章。听你们俩聊平面设计，感觉真好。
[00:36:24.240] or just cleaning and James peppering the ball I think it's like a good mix of like believing in yourself and also anticipating what's coming next so you're prepared for it I realized that
[00:36:24.240] 或者只是清理场地，让詹姆斯不断传球，我认为这就像是相信自己和预判接下来会发生什么并做好准备的一个很好的结合，我意识到了这一点。
[00:36:37.200] just in any of my hobbies when I'm anticipating my next move or what I'm about to do next I'm able to I guess just like pre-plan in my head subconsciously and that keeps the momentum going
[00:36:37.200] 在我的任何爱好中，当我预想下一步行动或即将要做的事情时，我都能在潜意识里进行预先计划，这能让我保持前进的势头。
[00:36:49.280] in whatever I'm doing and that really helps prevent me from feeling clunky or second guessing what I'm going to do. Damn momentum is a really good word dude I can't stop thinking about okay
[00:36:49.280] 无论我在做什么，这都能让我保持专注，避免笨拙或犹豫不决。该死的“动量”这个词真好，我一直在想它。
[00:37:01.360] this is so random but do you remember when Kanye was like writing that one album and then he was like oh I'm like almost done with the album I'm just gonna sleep in that like one football stadium
[00:37:01.360] 这事儿有点跑题了，但你还记得坎耶写那张专辑的时候吗？然后他说：“哦，专辑快写完了，我要在那个足球场里睡一觉。”
[00:37:12.960] until I finish the album or something I remember when I was young I was like dude what the fuck like this guy that's just wild but then the more I think about it I feel like momentum is such a true
[00:37:12.960] 直到我完成这张专辑或者其他什么，我才会想起我年轻的时候，我会想，老兄，这人简直太疯狂了，这到底是怎么回事？但后来我越想越觉得，这种势头真是太真实了。
[00:37:23.360] thing like once you miss it it might take a little bit for you to recharge it and you kind of lose that forward moving energy a little bit so then I feel like knowing that you're on the right
[00:37:23.360] 就像一旦你错过了机会，可能需要一段时间才能重新振作起来，你会稍微失去前进的动力，所以我觉得知道自己走在正确的道路上很重要。
[00:37:35.920] side of the energy or like knowing that you have good energy right now is also a big thing it maybe allows you to like believe in yourself a little bit and just trust that things will work out.
[00:37:35.920] 能量的一面，或者说知道自己现在能量充沛，也是一件大事，它或许能让你对自己多一些信心，并相信事情会好起来的。
[00:37:46.080] That's true I don't think I ever hit flow state if I was like exhausted or like not feeling it like in a bad mood or something it's usually like when I'm in a good mood had good rest then I'm like
[00:37:46.080] 确实如此，我觉得如果我筋疲力尽或者心情不好，就很难进入心流状态。通常只有在心情好、休息充足的时候，我才能进入心流状态。
[00:37:58.560] ready to sit down and work and then it's like easier to kind of get in the zone from there. I think some racket sports I might be wrong but I think some racket sports even have rules to
[00:37:58.560] 准备好坐下来工作，然后就更容易进入状态。我觉得有些球拍运动（我可能记错了）甚至有规则……
[00:38:11.760] keep the players in flow state so when players are like on a winning streak or getting near the final points you're not allowed to call it a really long timeout or just disturb that state
[00:38:11.760] 保持玩家处于心流状态，所以当玩家连胜或接近决胜分时，不允许进行长时间的暂停或以任何方式打断这种状态。
[00:38:23.680] otherwise it's like hindrance and it's just not great for the game. I think like maybe a lot of sports too a lot like I think you see it in basketball a lot you just call timeout near the
[00:38:23.680] 否则就会造成阻碍，对比赛不利。我觉得很多运动也是如此，比如篮球，经常会在比赛临近结束时叫暂停。
[00:38:33.120] end of the game if there's if it's really close so you can disturb the energy just trying to realign the vibes so you can turn turn the tides. Wait that's so true like when the other team is going
[00:38:33.120] 比赛快结束的时候，如果比分真的非常接近，你可以扰乱对方的节奏，试图重新调整局势，从而扭转战局。等等，这说得太对了，就像对方球队进攻的时候一样。
[00:38:43.440] on a run or something then the defensive team or whatever is like all right timeout we can't let them continue that momentum we need to stop the ball. Yeah it makes a lot of sense too because
[00:38:43.440] 对方进攻推进的时候，防守方就会想：好了，叫暂停，不能让他们继续保持这股势头，我们需要阻止他们进攻。是啊，这很有道理，因为
[00:38:54.480] you said I think in tennis if people are being loud in the crowd the umpire tells them to shut up they're like you can't just yell you know these people are very concentrated and same with golf
[00:38:54.480] 你说在网球比赛中，如果观众席上有人大声喧哗，裁判会让他们安静下来，因为你知道，这些人注意力非常集中，不能随便喊叫。高尔夫也是一样。
[00:39:05.760] like usually if people are loud or something they're like hey what the heck like be quiet anyway I do have a final question for us and I think GC you kind of touched upon this but
[00:39:05.760] 通常情况下，如果有人大声喧哗，他们就会说“嘿，搞什么鬼，安静点”。总之，我还有一个问题要问大家，我觉得GC你刚才也稍微提到过，但是……
[00:39:31.600] have you actually ever reached flow state with another person whether it's a group or one other person so I guess like the example that you said GC was when James and our other friend like was
[00:39:31.600] 你有没有和别人一起进入过心流状态，无论是和一群人还是和另一个人？比如你刚才提到的GC的例子，就是James和我们另一个朋友……
[00:39:43.680] in flow state hitting the spike ball. So yes I have and I feel like my most recent experience of reaching flow state with someone else was at work actually I was like working on this report
[00:39:43.680] 心流状态下击打尖刺球。是的，我有过这种经历，而且我觉得我最近一次和别人一起进入心流状态是在工作中，当时我正在写一份报告。
[00:39:59.280] and it was something that was like a request from an external team so it required a lot of data setup and then also like fine tuning of the formatting and whatever just making sure that it's
[00:39:59.280] 这是来自外部团队的请求，所以需要大量的数据准备工作，然后还需要对格式进行微调等等，总之就是确保它……
[00:40:09.520] a palatable report that's ready to be sent out to everyone in the company. I was like on a video call with someone trying to fix it or like work on it we just like blasted through all of it in like 40
[00:40:09.520] 一份可以发给公司所有人的、易于理解的报告。我当时正在和某人视频通话，试图修复或完善它，我们大概只用了40分钟就把所有内容都搞定了。
[00:40:22.400] minutes in our first meeting and I was like whoa this is kind of crazy but it was just like everything that I needed to do but it was like everything that I maybe had a doubt on or like a question
[00:40:22.400] 第一次见面才几分钟，我就觉得，哇，这有点不可思议，但所有我需要做的事情，以及我可能存在的疑问或问题，都一一解答了。
[00:40:33.520] about the other person could answer and vice versa as soon as the other person said what their opinion was I had already been thinking it so I was already like doing it on the report and it was just like
[00:40:33.520] 关于对方能否回答，反之亦然，因为一旦对方说出他们的观点，我其实已经想到了，所以我已经开始在报告里写进去了，就像这样。
[00:40:45.280] so efficient we like worked on it together and the experience was such a positive one that I felt like it was very much like a bonding experience of like whoa we really did that. So yeah I felt
[00:40:45.280] 效率太高了，我们一起合作完成的，整个过程非常积极，我觉得这就像一次增进感情的经历，感觉就像“哇，我们真的做到了”。所以，是的，我感觉
[00:40:56.080] very proud and I was like this is peak work flow state. I agree it feels amazing when you have that great teamwork and you're just bonded in that moment. I was able to reach flow state with my
[00:40:56.080] 我感到非常自豪，当时我就觉得这就是最佳工作状态。我同意，当团队合作如此出色，彼此之间紧密相连时，那种感觉真的太棒了。我能够和我一起进入心流状态
[00:41:09.920] friend when we're playing this game called Destiny he was getting me into gaming during COVID and I really haven't gamed before so I've never reached flow state but we were doing this co-op dungeon
[00:41:09.920] 我和朋友一起玩一款叫《命运》的游戏，他是在新冠疫情期间带我入坑的，我以前从来没玩过游戏，所以从来没有进入过心流状态。当时我们正在玩一个合作地牢。
[00:41:22.720] map thing. I'm not a gamer so I don't really have the terms for this but basically we were dying so much but we learned little details about every round, about the map and eventually we got
[00:41:22.720] 地图那部分。我不是游戏玩家，所以不太懂相关的术语，但基本上我们死了无数次，但我们从每一轮游戏中都学到了一些关于地图的小细节，最终我们掌握了这些技巧。
[00:41:34.800] into this flow state where we're still dying a lot but we're learning so much about each other's patterns about when the boss is going to spawn, the mini bosses are going to spawn
[00:41:34.800] 我们进入了一种心流状态，虽然仍然经常死亡，但我们对彼此的战斗模式了解了很多，比如boss什么时候会出现，小boss什么时候会出现。
[00:41:44.560] and it got to the point where we knew exactly where each other were and what to expect. Our communication was great we're just yelling on discord like I'm here I'm here or like do this
[00:41:44.560] 后来我们彼此之间非常清楚对方的位置和下一步该做什么。我们的沟通非常顺畅，我们直接在Discord上喊“我在这儿，我在这儿”或者“做这个”就行了。
[00:41:55.040] I'm about to do this and we knew exactly what was going to happen. After that we didn't really look at each other but it felt like we looked at each other and nodded and said we really did that
[00:41:55.040] 我正要这么做，我们都知道接下来会发生什么。之后我们并没有真正看着对方，但感觉我们彼此对视了一会儿，点了点头，仿佛在说我们真的这么做了。
[00:42:04.160] we walked in like we felt so good and we still talk about it till today. Dude nice, you touched each other's souls through discord. Exactly. I love that oh my god mine is actually kind of similar
[00:42:04.160] 我们走进去的时候感觉特别好，直到今天我们还在谈论这件事。兄弟，真棒，你们通过不和谐的对话触动了彼此的灵魂。没错。我喜欢这种感觉，我的天，我的经历其实也有点类似。
[00:42:19.440] this is a really funny one it was me and our other friend Brian were playing this volleyball game against Jisoo and James and okay we were like the first I think two games or two matches
[00:42:19.440] 这事儿真的太搞笑了，当时我和另一个朋友布莱恩跟智秀和詹姆斯打排球，我们大概打了前两局或者两场比赛吧。
[00:42:33.680] like me and Brian were losing and then in the third one I think it started off a little rough but then we went on this like four point streak but then okay the sad part is that we celebrated
[00:42:33.680] 我和布莱恩一开始都输了，然后第三局我觉得开局有点艰难，但后来我们打出了一波四连胜，但可惜的是，我们庆祝了。
[00:42:46.080] too hard and then I think I got pulled out of it and then we started losing and I was like oh shit I just choked but you know those four points in a row were a great feeling. The momentum was there
[00:42:46.080] 太拼了，然后我觉得我被拉出来了，接着我们就开始输球，我当时就想，糟了，我彻底崩盘了。不过你知道，那连得四分的感觉真棒。势头正盛。
[00:43:00.160] yeah okay also to be fair James was starting to look at Jisoo in a very scary way so I was like oh my god like I am destroying their marriage right now. Wait I was actually dying because
[00:43:00.160] 好吧，说实话，James 开始用一种很吓人的眼神看着 Jisoo，我当时就想，我的天哪，我这是在破坏他们的婚姻吗？等等，我当时真的快要崩溃了，因为
[00:43:14.320] James and I we were all like sitting together in a row on the sofa and then James and I were sitting next to each other so James was looking at me and just being like oh you need to lock in
[00:43:14.320] 我和詹姆斯当时都并排坐在沙发上，然后我和詹姆斯挨着坐，詹姆斯看着我说：“哦，你得闭嘴了。”
[00:43:23.760] but because we were sitting next to each other I guess his face was kind of close to me. Dude it was so close. I feel like this is what broke your flow state crystals are freaking out she's like oh my
[00:43:23.760] 但因为我们坐在一起，我觉得他的脸离我很近。老兄，真的太近了。我觉得这就是打破你心流状态的原因，你的心智好像崩溃了，她就像在说“哦，我的天哪”。
[00:43:32.080] god I've never seen their faces so close together in my life like they're so close. I was like wait you were at our wedding you're actually right there officiating. Yeah I was like oh my god I
[00:43:32.080] 天哪，我这辈子都没见过他们的脸靠得这么近，真的太近了。我当时就想，等等，你参加了我们的婚礼，你现在就在那儿主持仪式呢。是啊，我当时就想，我的天哪！
[00:43:48.940] cannot win this game but I totally agree when you're so in tune with another person it's just like holy shit like we're like crushing it right now we're like we're on top of the world like
[00:43:48.940] 虽然赢不了这场比赛，但我完全同意，当你和另一个人如此默契的时候，感觉就像“卧槽，我们现在简直势不可挡，感觉自己站在世界之巅”一样。
[00:44:01.340] nothing can beat us until you get pulled out of that. I actually have another one to share I was on my first date with my girlfriend right now we're both climbers and we decided to do
[00:44:01.340] 只要你不从那种境地中挣脱出来，就没人能打败我们。我其实还有另一个故事要分享，我和我女朋友第一次约会，我们俩都是登山爱好者，我们决定……
[00:44:15.020] climbing for our first date because it's something we both enjoy and it'll be like a comfortable hangout and I think because we both knew that we both climbed we didn't want to choke
[00:44:15.020] 我们第一次约会就选了攀岩，因为我们俩都喜欢这项运动，而且感觉会很轻松自在。我想，正因为我们都知道彼此都喜欢攀岩，所以才不想在攀岩的时候手忙脚乱。
[00:44:25.340] you know so we both locked in and we barely talked because we chose to do top roping where you climb with the rope while one person is climbing the other person is blowing them which
[00:44:25.340] 你知道，所以我们俩都全神贯注，几乎没怎么说话，因为我们选择的是顶绳攀岩，就是一个人爬绳子的时候，另一个人给他吹气。
[00:44:36.380] is when you have the rope and you make sure they don't fall down so we were just really locked in trying to perform our best and we didn't exchange any words for like 30 minutes because after I was
[00:44:36.380] 就是当你拿着绳子，确保他们不会掉下去的时候，所以我们当时全神贯注，努力做到最好，大概有30分钟我们都没说话，因为之后我……
[00:44:47.740] done climbing we just unhooked the rope and hooked the other person on and then she would start climbing. I just feel a sense of relief when I got to the top like thank god I didn't fall
[00:44:47.740] 爬完之后，我们解开绳子，把另一个人挂上去，然后她就开始往上爬。我爬到顶的时候，感觉如释重负，心想谢天谢地我没掉下来。
[00:44:57.420] didn't embarrass myself in front of my crush and then so we didn't talk very much until we decided to go towards bouldering and even the first few couple boulders we didn't really talk
[00:44:57.420] 我没在暗恋对象面前出丑，所以我们之后也没怎么说话，直到我们决定去抱石攀岩。即便在攀爬最初的几块岩石时，我们也没怎么交流。
[00:45:08.620] until I finally snapped out of the flow state and I was like damn we didn't talk yet so I just turned and faced her and we started like okay I just realized we haven't been talking and then I
[00:45:08.620] 直到我终于从那种心流状态中回过神来，我才意识到“糟了，我们还没说话呢”，于是我转过身面对她，我们开始聊天，就像“好吧，我才意识到我们一直没说话”，然后我
[00:45:19.100] asked I don't remember what question I asked but yeah we started talking after. Damn when you have to manually break flow state. Oh my god but there's something cute in that too it's like I can't f**k
[00:45:19.100] 我问了，我不记得我问了什么问题，但之后我们就开始聊天了。该死，当你不得不手动打破心流状态的时候。我的天，但这其中也有点可爱，就像我不能……
[00:45:29.980] up in front of the person I like like you're so concentrated I feel like that's like a pretty funny one. Oh that was cute well it was definitely really interesting talking about our various
[00:45:29.980] 在我喜欢的人面前，你却那么专注，我觉得这挺搞笑的。哦，真可爱。嗯，聊我们各种各样的事情确实很有意思。
[00:45:40.700] hobbies and about flow state with you both. It feels like even though our hobbies are somewhat different in a way I feel like the experience of reaching flow state and really diving into a hobby
[00:45:40.700] 和你们俩聊聊爱好和心流状态。虽然我们的爱好有些不同，但我感觉进入心流状态、真正沉浸于爱好中的体验都很棒。
