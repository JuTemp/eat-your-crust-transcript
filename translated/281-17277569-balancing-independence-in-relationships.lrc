[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. So today we have a relationship topic to cover. And I actually think this concept is quite important. And I'm feeling its importance grow a little bit more, even in recent months. Today, we're going to discuss maintaining independence in a relationship. Quick context for our listeners. If anyone is new to this podcast, Crystal and I are both in long term relationships. I guess it's more accurate to say that I'm in a marriage.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo。今天我们要聊聊恋爱关系的话题。我觉得这个概念非常重要，而且最近几个月，我感觉它的重要性似乎越来越凸显。今天，我们要讨论的是如何保持恋爱关系中的独立性。先给听众朋友们简单介绍一下背景。如果是第一次收听这个播客的朋友，我和Crystal目前都处于恋爱关系中。更准确地说，我已经结婚了。
[00:00:40.590] Now. So we are in it and committed and I think have a lot of learnings to share in terms of maintaining independence. And I think maintaining independence is a big thing for me because I value alone time a lot and I'm definitely more of an introvert. So I think it comes naturally with the territory. And sometimes it's easy to get like really consumed in a relationship, especially in the beginning.
[00:00:40.590] 现在，我们已经在一起了，而且彼此投入，我认为我们在保持独立性方面有很多经验可以分享。对我来说，保持独立性非常重要，因为我非常珍惜独处的时间，而且我绝对是一个比较内向的人。所以我觉得这对我来说是自然而然的事情。有时候，人们很容易在一段感情中过度投入，尤其是在感情的初期。
[00:01:09.130] And then I feel like as things develop and normalize and routines form, you start to realize, huh, I need to make sure that I have time for myself too. Honestly, I think this concept is something that I had to actively learn. I think I would consider myself a pretty relationship oriented person. I'm also an extrovert. So to me, spending time with someone is like the default.
[00:01:09.130] 然后我觉得，随着事情的发展和常态化，生活逐渐形成规律，你才会开始意识到，嗯，我也需要给自己留出时间。说实话，我觉得这个概念是我需要主动学习的。我自认为是一个很重视人际关系的人，而且我性格外向。所以对我来说，和别人在一起就像是理所当然的事。
[00:01:33.710] I don't love to have a ton of solo blocks in my week where I'm not hanging out with someone. When you're in a relationship, it's very easy to have the most comfortable person that you love fill that spot. So I think past me and maybe even current me is very much used to like spending your entire life with someone, like every single moment of it.
[00:01:33.710] 我不喜欢一周里有很多独处的时间，感觉没有伴侣陪伴。恋爱的时候，很容易让最亲近、最爱你的人来填补这段独处时光。所以我觉得过去的我，甚至现在的我，都非常习惯和某个人共度一生，每一分每一秒都形影不离。
[00:01:56.810] You know, talking with other girlfriends, of course, you and just learning that for other people, like they want to have a, I guess, stronger balance between alone time and relationship time was kind of shocking to me. So I feel like in college, that was when I was kind of testing myself in this area, maybe testing and failing, but still testing. Hey, that's good. At least you're still testing. Maybe to me, the biggest core part of this is that you maintain a sense of self.
[00:01:56.810] 你知道，和其他女朋友聊天，当然，还有你，我了解到其他人也希望在独处时间和恋爱时间之间找到更好的平衡，这让我有点惊讶。所以我觉得大学的时候，我在这方面一直在尝试，也许尝试失败了，但至少我还在尝试。嘿，这很好。至少你还在尝试。对我来说，这件事最核心的部分在于保持自我。
[00:02:26.610] You don't just become your relationship. You're still your own person. Sometimes people forget that a little bit. That's true. It is very easy to slip into like what is more comfortable and what is like your day to day. And I feel like especially when you live with someone, that boundary starts to get pretty blurred as well. Yeah, I feel like since I currently live separately from my boyfriend, it's easier sometimes to set boundaries.
[00:02:26.610] 你不会完全变成你恋爱关系中的一部分。你仍然是你自己。有时候人们会忘记这一点。确实如此。很容易陷入更舒适、更符合你日常生活习惯的状态。我觉得尤其当你和某人同居时，这种界限也会变得很模糊。是的，我觉得因为我现在和男朋友分开住，所以有时候更容易设定界限。
[00:02:51.730] We have like a pseudo schedule kind of where it's like these days are usually reserved for us time. And these other weekdays are more reserved for getting ourselves together during the week. Ooh, okay. I have a question, maybe not completely related to this topic, but just my own curiosity. Say you carve out like three days a week to hang out with your partner, right? When you don't live with him. Yeah.
[00:02:51.730] 我们有个类似非正式日程表的东西，这些日子通常是留给我们俩的。而其他工作日则更多地用来安排我们一周的相处时间。哦，好的。我有个问题，可能跟这个话题不太相关，但我只是好奇。假设你每周抽出三天时间和你的伴侣一起玩，对吧？前提是你们不住在一起。嗯。
[00:03:17.310] But of course, as things come up, there's social obligations, birthday parties, group dinners, and things where you and your SO both have to be there. And that might potentially take up one or two of the days of that week, right? Would you want to fill that up? You know, have backlog of like, oh, since we had three full days of social obligations this week, let's have one broad day together. Or would you be like, well, that's, you know, our quotas up. See you next week.
[00:03:17.310] 当然，生活中总会有各种各样的事情，比如社交活动、生日聚会、集体聚餐等等，你和你的伴侣都必须出席。这些活动可能会占用一周中的一两天，对吧？你想把这些时间都安排好吗？比如，你会不会觉得“哦，既然我们这周已经有三天社交活动了，不如再抽出一天时间好好相处吧”？还是你会觉得“好了，我们的社交活动已经安排好了，下周见”？
[00:03:48.110] Okay, wait. This is actually a really good question. When things are happening in a day-to-day sense, and it's just, you know, extra social obligations are tacked on, then our time just naturally extends. But it does kind of hit like a certain point where it's like, okay, you need to leave. Actually, recently we had a big trip for a friend's wedding.
[00:03:48.110] 等等，这确实是个好问题。如果每天都有很多事情发生，再加上一些额外的社交活动，我们的时间自然而然就会延长。但总会有那么一个时刻，你会觉得，好吧，该走了。实际上，最近我们为了参加朋友的婚礼，去了一趟很远的地方。
[00:04:17.030] You know, our whole friend group did. And me and my boyfriend ended up traveling for almost like three weeks total. And so when we finally got back, we spent the first night together. And then after the next day, I was like, okay, I'll see you next week. The door's over there. I mean, honestly, that makes sense. I feel like the closest way to describe it that I can feel is, you know, when you hang out with someone for a long time and you like hold in a fart.
[00:04:17.030] 你知道，我们整个朋友圈都这样。我和我男朋友最后一起旅行了差不多三个星期。所以当我们终于回来的时候，我们第一晚就待在一起。然后第二天，我就说，好吧，下周见。门在那边。说真的，这很正常。我觉得最贴切的形容就是，你知道，就像你和某人待了很久，然后憋着一个屁一样。
[00:04:46.710] And you're like having fun, but you're like, I need this person to leave so that I can release this fart. I think depending on who it is, there's varying levels where you can like stand them or like stand to like hold in that fart. And with your boyfriend, of course, the amount of time that you can hold it is much longer, right? Like super, super long. But you still have to like occasionally just release that somewhere. So maybe that's like somewhat of a metaphor.
[00:04:46.710] 你明明玩得很开心，但心里却想着：我得赶紧让这个人走，好让我放个屁。我觉得这得看对象是谁，你能忍受的程度也不同，有的你能忍受，有的你能憋住屁。当然，如果是跟男朋友在一起，你能憋的时间就长得多，对吧？超级超级长。但你还是得时不时找个地方放一下。所以，这或许算是一种比喻吧。
[00:05:13.630] Yeah, and I think because we don't live together, our personal space is in separate areas. And that's probably the biggest thing. If we lived in some sort of place where it was cohabitating, then it would be easier to be like, all right, let's, you know, take a quiet day. Just go to our own spaces and recover versus now where it's like, okay, I guess you could recover in my space or I could recover in your space. But it might just be ultimately more comfortable if we're in our own spaces.
[00:05:13.630] 是的，我觉得因为我们不住在一起，所以我们的个人空间是分开的。这大概是最大的问题。如果我们住在某种合住的地方，那就更容易说，好吧，咱们找个安静的地方休息一天吧。各自回自己的空间放松一下，而不是像现在这样，好像你可以去我的空间休息，或者我可以去你的空间休息。但最终，我们各自待在自己的空间里可能更舒服。
[00:05:43.650] Yeah, that's true. I feel like you're right. Environment definitely does have a big impact on it. And when you're curating like a shared space together, your shared apartment or, you know, your shared house, then you can carve out those spaces separately. But when you're over at someone else's place, it's like inevitably kind of a guest and innkeeper type of relationship. Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:43.650] 没错，确实如此。我觉得你说得对。环境确实有很大的影响。如果你们一起布置共享空间，比如合租公寓或者合租房子，你们就可以各自划分出自己的空间。但如果是在别人家，那就不可避免地会形成一种类似客人和店主的关系。对，没错。
[00:06:07.270] But I guess beyond this concept of personal space, I like that you mentioned maintaining a sense of self. I kind of feel like this is something that comes very naturally to introverts. This is just my personal theory. And as an extrovert myself, my sense of self is sometimes derived from the relationships that I have with people around me. So it's not necessarily like personal time that makes me feel more like myself. It's like affirming my relationships with my closest friends and family and seeing myself in their eyes.
[00:06:07.270] 但除了个人空间这个概念之外，我很赞同你提到的保持自我意识这一点。我觉得这对于内向者来说似乎是一种很自然的能力。这只是我个人的看法。而我自己是个外向者，我的自我意识有时来源于我与周围人的关系。所以，让我感觉更像自己的，并不一定需要独处的时间。而是与我最亲密的朋友和家人建立联系，并在他们的眼中看到自己。
[00:06:37.110] Like that's my true sense of self, you know? So how does this sense of self look like for you? Like what do you think are factors that make you really feel like at home and like yourself? Oh, okay. I guess like one part of it is doing things that I want to do. Not something that's a social obligation or something that like maybe I do want to do, but it was like because someone else told me or like someone else is like hosting something.
[00:06:37.110] 你知道吗？那才是我真正的自我认知。那么，你的这种自我认知又是怎样的呢？你觉得哪些因素会让你感到自在，让你真正做回自己？哦，好的。我想其中一部分就是做自己想做的事情。不是那种出于社交义务，或者我虽然想做，但因为别人告诉我，或者别人要举办什么活动之类的事情。
[00:07:05.930] I think that's like a big part. So I guess, you know, solo hobbies to put it into a phrase. And I guess like in a relationship, most of the time there's some sort of compromise or you're like working as a team. You're like a unit together. But then to be able to have like your own sense of self and like be your own unit is important in my perspective.
[00:07:05.930] 我觉得这很重要。所以，用一句话概括就是，个人爱好。我觉得就像在一段感情关系中，大多数时候都需要某种妥协，或者说你们像一个团队一样合作。你们就像一个整体。但同时，能够拥有自己的独立空间，成为独立的个体，在我看来也很重要。
[00:07:34.070] Because then when you come together as a team, you can bring your other qualities in. You work together with your differences to become like a better, stronger unit together. If that makes sense. Yeah, yeah. I'm like picturing like a work group or something. Like a corporate team. But it makes sense.
[00:07:34.070] 因为这样一来，当你们组成团队时，就可以发挥各自的优势。你们可以克服彼此的差异，共同努力，成为一个更强大、更优秀的整体。如果我这么说你能理解的话。嗯，嗯。我脑海里浮现的是一个工作小组之类的场景，就像一个公司团队。但确实很有道理。
[00:07:57.070] Like if you share 100% of your life with your partner, there's not a ton you can do outside of that relationship to continue to enhance it. And I think it leads to a lot of like codependency where you're waiting for your partner so that you can do something. Or you have to have your partner to be there so that you can check this off. And that's something that I've definitely struggled with a lot in the past and probably still continue to kind of grapple with.
[00:07:57.070] 如果你把生活的全部都投入到伴侣身上，那么除了这段关系之外，你很难做其他事情来维系它。我认为这会导致很多依赖关系，你会等着伴侣来帮你做事，或者必须有伴侣在场才能完成某件事。这方面我过去一直很挣扎，现在可能还在努力克服。
[00:08:22.010] Of like how do I not take something that is so pure and awesome and genuine, like a strong relationship? How do I prevent myself from morphing it into like something that I need and like depend on to do every single thing in my life? And I think COVID was like a big turning point for me. For the worst. Oh no. Because I feel like pre-COVID, everyone had their own life, you know, and you were so like used to that. And it was like the status quo.
[00:08:22.010] 我该如何才能不把如此纯粹、美好、真挚的东西，比如一段牢固的关系，据为己有呢？我该如何避免把它变成我生活中不可或缺、事事依赖的东西呢？我觉得新冠疫情对我来说是个巨大的转折点，而且是往坏的方向发展。哦，不。因为我觉得在疫情之前，每个人都有自己的生活，你知道，大家都习以为常了。那就像是常态。
[00:08:50.030] And then during COVID, obviously you can't go out. I'm sure anyone who was living with their partner during COVID might be able to relate to parts of this. But it's like you truly can only do things as like a unit. I think the most like solo thing I was doing at the time was like maybe gaming or like going on runs. And then post-COVID, building our individual lives back up, I think was a learning process, like almost doing it from bottoms up. So yeah, it's not something that comes like very naturally for me.
[00:08:50.030] 然后疫情期间，显然你不能出门。我相信任何在疫情期间和伴侣同住的人都能感同身受。感觉你们真的只能像一个整体一样一起做事。我觉得当时我独自做的最“独处”的事情大概就是玩游戏或者跑步了。疫情过后，重建我们各自的生活，我觉得是一个学习的过程，几乎是从零开始。所以，是的，这对我来说并不是一件自然而然的事情。
[00:09:19.370] Like I think my natural desire is to like want to take this thing that I love and just slather it onto every aspect of my life, you know? That's fair. And I feel like that's not even necessarily just an introvert slash extrovert difference as well. Because I feel like I probably crave independence a little more than like my boyfriend does.
[00:09:19.370] 我觉得我天生就想把这份热爱融入到生活的方方面面，你知道吗？这很正常。而且我觉得这甚至不一定只是内向和外向的区别。因为我觉得我可能比我男朋友更渴望独立。
[00:09:45.110] He definitely leans more towards spending more time together and less time apart. Actually, this made me learn some concept in therapy. Our lives are a Venn diagram. When you're in a relationship, this Venn diagram, you know, a romantic relationship, a friendship, any sort of relationship, your Venn diagrams, your circles overlap. And it's up to you two to decide how much you want that overlap to be.
[00:09:45.110] 他显然更倾向于多花时间在一起，少分开。事实上，这让我从心理咨询中学到了一个概念。我们的生活就像一个维恩图。当你身处一段关系中时，无论是恋爱关系、友谊，还是任何其他类型的关系，你们的维恩图、你们的圆圈都会重叠。而这种重叠的程度，则取决于你们两个人。
[00:10:13.570] But if that overlap becomes 100%, then that becomes codependency and that's not good for anyone. So it's like, what is the healthy balance for both you and your partner without going to like zero or 100? The answer lies somewhere in between. Yeah, that makes sense. It also makes a lot of sense to me that you and your partner decide this together.
[00:10:13.570] 但如果这种重叠达到100%，那就变成了相互依赖，这对谁都没好处。所以关键在于，如何才能找到一个对你和伴侣都健康的平衡点，既不会完全重叠，也不会完全重叠？答案就在两者之间。嗯，这很有道理。而且，你和伴侣一起决定这件事也很有道理。
[00:10:39.570] It's not something that can be decided based on like what one person wants. So you're right. I guess you do have to kind of collaborate to reach a point that works for both of you. Yeah. Okay. What do you think your Venn diagram percentage overlap would be? Oh, dude. I feel like it has to be like... Actually, recently my learning has been this. I think my instinct is to have it be like almost 100%. If I'm being honest. Maybe not 100. Maybe like 90.
[00:10:39.570] 这事儿不能光凭一个人的想法就决定。所以你说得对。我觉得你们确实需要合作，才能找到一个双方都能接受的方案。嗯。好的。你觉得你们的维恩图重叠部分会是多少？哦，老兄。我觉得应该差不多……其实，我最近学到的是这个。我觉得我的直觉是接近100%。说实话，也许不到100%，大概90%吧。
[00:11:09.070] That's like my instinct. And then lately, I feel like I've been having just more enrichment in my social life, I guess. More girl strips and more fun things to celebrate that doesn't always involve my husband. Even though that kind of goes against my will and like what I want. I realize like the benefit that it has. Like that emotional or maybe like mental impact that it has on me is huge.
[00:11:09.070] 那就像我的直觉。最近，我觉得我的社交生活更加丰富了。我参加了更多脱衣舞俱乐部，也庆祝了很多其他有趣的事情，这些事情并不总是离不开我的丈夫。虽然这有点违背我的意愿，也并非我所愿，但我意识到它带来的好处。它对我的情感，或许还有精神层面的影响，是巨大的。
[00:11:37.190] So my answer is that even though I probably want it to be at like 90. Yeah. I think the healthy balance is maybe like 75. 70 to 75. And that's kind of where it's been trending lately. Like I feel like it sits around that like 70 to 75 mark. That's good. And I feel like it's natural for the Venn diagram percentage to increase when you live together as well.
[00:11:37.190] 所以我的答案是，虽然我可能希望它达到90%左右，但我认为比较健康的平衡点可能是75%，70%到75%。而且最近的趋势也差不多在这个范围内。我觉得它稳定在70%到75%之间。这很好。而且我觉得，当你们住在一起的时候，维恩图的比例自然也会增加。
[00:12:03.310] I feel like it's almost a privilege for me to be able to have the Venn diagram percentage smaller. But when you talked about having girls trips and like more other social happenings without your husband. I also remembered you have a book club that's been going on since like college, right? Right. That one I think James isn't a part of and never has been, right? That is true. Yeah. He doesn't sit in on those.
[00:12:03.310] 我觉得能让维恩图的比例更小对我来说几乎是一种特权。不过，你刚才提到和闺蜜们一起旅行，或者参加其他一些没有你丈夫的社交活动。我还想起你有个读书俱乐部，好像从大学就开始了，对吧？对。我记得詹姆斯没参加过，也从来没参加过，对吧？没错。是的，他从不参加那些活动。
[00:12:31.070] And then that made my mind wander off to like, dude, you also need these social interactions because then it gives you the chance to like share your funny stories without having sometimes the subject of the story being there. True. Or like without it being like just work stuff, right? Yeah. I feel like the default is like, oh, this happened at work. And then it like dries up because everything else is shared. But you're so right.
[00:12:31.070] 然后我就想到，哥们儿，你也需要这些社交互动，因为这样你才能有机会分享你的趣事，而不用担心故事的主角不在场。没错。或者说，不用总是聊工作上的事，对吧？是啊。我觉得默认的模式就是，哦，这件事发生在工作上。然后就没什么可聊的了，因为其他事都分享过了。你说得太对了。
[00:12:58.930] I guess there are parts of my life that have been ongoing that are separate and I just don't notice it. However, I know that you mentioned that you have a lower Venn diagram percentage. I'm so curious what your like ideal level is. Oh my God. Okay. Um, I remember when I first learned about this concept and I was thinking about it. This was also earlier in my relationship, just as a, you know, preface.
[00:12:58.930] 我想，我生活中有些部分一直在持续，它们彼此独立，只是我没有注意到而已。不过，我知道你提到过你的维恩图比例比较低。我很好奇你理想的比例是多少。我的天哪。好吧。嗯，我记得我第一次接触到这个概念的时候，我一直在思考它。那也是我恋爱初期，算是……前言吧。
[00:13:28.010] Uh, I think my percentage was like, maybe it was like 30. Bro. Wait, wait. This was in the beginning though. Like the beginning of the relationship. We're still like, you know. Ramping up. Yeah. Yeah. And I actually distinctly remember, cause you know, in the beginning of a relationship, it's like all honeymoon phase and you're like spending so much time together.
[00:13:28.010] 呃，我觉得我的百分比大概是，可能30%吧。兄弟。等等，等等。不过那是刚开始的时候。就像恋爱初期那样。我们还在磨合期呢。对。对。而且我印象特别深，因为你知道，恋爱初期就像蜜月期，你们会花很多时间在一起。
[00:13:53.910] And I think there was this one point where me and my boyfriend spent almost like two weeks straight together. Whoa. At least it felt like that. It was either one week straight or two weeks straight. Okay. And then at the end of that time, I told him, I was like, oh, I think I need more alone time than what just happened. Just to let you know. Like, I feel like in the future we should avoid having like such long consecutive time together
[00:13:53.910] 我记得有那么一段时间，我和我男朋友几乎连续两周都待在一起。哇哦。至少感觉是这样。可能是连续一周，也可能是连续两周。好吧。然后在那段时间结束的时候，我跟他说，我觉得我需要更多独处的时间。只是想跟你说一声。就是，我觉得以后我们应该避免连续这么长时间待在一起。
[00:14:22.550] because I need time to like recharge and do my own activities as well. And I was like, okay. But I guess like now my Venn diagram is more like 50-ish. I like how we both have like such extreme. I mean, I will say 90 feels more extreme than 30, but we like start off with the extreme number and we've settled off more in the middle.
[00:14:22.550] 因为我需要时间充电，也需要做一些自己的事情。然后我就想，好吧。但我想现在我的维恩图更像是50左右。我喜欢我们俩都这么极端。我的意思是，我会说90比30更极端，但我们一开始都选择了极端的数字，然后逐渐稳定在中间。
[00:14:51.640] Honestly, I can appreciate that. Like as someone who enjoys and like wants as much overlap as possible, I think it's really commendable that you set a hard boundary and like boundary setting as a concept is just already impressive to me. But to be able to like identify what your need is and to like communicate that to your partner early on, I think is super healthy. Yeah.
[00:14:51.640] 说实话，我能理解。作为一个喜欢尽可能多地与伴侣保持亲密关系的人，我觉得你能设定明确的界限真的非常值得称赞，而且我觉得设定界限这个概念本身就很了不起。但是，能够认清自己的需求，并尽早与伴侣沟通，我认为这非常健康。是的。
[00:15:16.980] Because the big thing was like I could feel myself not being myself in a sense. Like I wasn't doing some of the things that I'm used to doing before the relationship because you kind of have your own routine and then you have to like adjust it accordingly. So sometimes that like sudden change is a lot. And I guess I noticed that and I was like, oh God, I need like to get my life together. Okay.
[00:15:16.980] 因为最主要的是，我感觉自己好像变了个人。比如，我不再做恋爱前习惯做的一些事情了，因为你总会有自己的生活规律，然后你必须相应地调整它。所以有时候，这种突然的变化会让人难以适应。我想我意识到了这一点，然后我就想，天哪，我得好好调整一下自己的生活了。好吧。
[00:15:43.840] Also, I don't know if you feel this, but sometimes I feel like spending time together in a relationship, everything else in your life is on pause. Oh. I guess because it's like so much of the time is focused on you two as a unit. Yeah. And then like your life as one person is on pause kind of. Oh, interesting.
[00:15:43.840] 还有，我不知道你有没有这种感觉，但有时候我觉得，恋爱期间，你们两个人在一起的时候，生活中的其他一切都好像暂停了。哦。我想是因为大部分时间都集中在你们两个人身上吧。是啊。然后，你作为个体的生活就好像暂停了一样。哦，有意思。
[00:16:08.320] I guess it's like hard for me to think back on like my single era, eons ago. But I can definitely understand that it forces you to deprioritize certain stuff. And I think that goes on. It's not just an early relationship thing. Like your relationship will be at least top three priority, right? Even if you're in it for a long time. So I can understand that you start to like rank other things and like have to shuffle stuff around and adjust to that.
[00:16:08.320] 我猜想，回想起单身时期，那已经是很久以前的事了，确实有点难。但我完全能理解，单身会迫使你降低某些事情的优先级。而且我觉得这种情况会持续下去，不仅仅是恋爱初期才会这样。毕竟，恋爱关系至少会是你生活中最重要的三件事之一，对吧？即使你们在一起很久。所以我能理解，你会开始重新审视其他事情，需要调整和适应。
[00:16:38.260] Yeah. One example could be in the beginning when we were spending a lot of time together and boundaries weren't set or like our routines weren't adjusted yet. There was suddenly a feeling on my end like, oh, I haven't talked to some of these friends in a while or I haven't seen certain friends in a while because we've been so focused on this relationship and now everything else in my life just feels like it's like the blurry background.
[00:16:38.260] 是的。举个例子，刚开始的时候，我们花很多时间在一起，彼此之间还没有设定界限，生活规律也还没调整好。突然间，我感觉好像，哦，我已经很久没和一些朋友联系了，或者很久没见到某些朋友了，因为我们一直把精力都放在这段感情上，现在我生活中的其他一切都像是模糊的背景。
[00:17:06.540] Yeah, I feel like you're very right. Like there is sort of a perspective shift that happens. But do you think it's kind of like a pendulum? Like maybe after a certain amount of time in like the new part of a relationship, it swings back? Or do you feel like things that get deprioritized during the conception or inception of a relationship stays deprioritized? Maybe there is a little bit of a pendulum swing. You know what?
[00:17:06.540] 是的，我觉得你说得很有道理。确实会发生某种视角转变。但你觉得这有点像钟摆吗？就像在一段关系的新阶段持续一段时间后，视角会摆回去？还是说，在一段关系的萌芽或开始阶段被忽略的事情，会一直被忽略下去？也许确实存在某种钟摆式的摆动。你知道吗？
[00:17:32.400] I think we've kind of talked about this before from the other perspective where we're like, oh, sometimes when people enter new relationships, they like disappear for a little while. Right. And that's like completely understandable. So you're right. Like it does swing back because then they start to like adjust their routines and like figure out how to be their own person while also being a unit. And I guess sometimes it takes longer to swing back. And sometimes it doesn't swing back all the way.
[00:17:32.400] 我想我们之前也从另一个角度讨论过这个问题，就是，有时候人们开始一段新的恋情后，会暂时消失一段时间。没错，这完全可以理解。所以你说得对。这种情况最终会恢复正常，因为他们会开始调整自己的生活节奏，摸索如何在保持独立性的同时，又能与伴侣共同生活。我想有时候，这种恢复正常需要更长的时间，甚至有时无法完全恢复。
[00:18:01.780] Actually, I guess like most of the time it won't swing back all the way to the level it used to be. Right. And that's just something you have to accept. That's true. I mean, there are just so many things that change when someone is in a relationship, whether it's yourself or like watching a friend enter a new relationship. One thing that I've experienced on a personal level is there's something that feels very weird, at least to me, about starting something new when you're in a relationship. Yeah.
[00:18:01.780] 其实，我觉得大多数时候它都不会完全恢复到以前的状态。没错。你必须接受这一点。确实如此。我的意思是，恋爱关系会改变很多事情，无论是自己恋爱还是看着朋友开始一段新的恋情。就我个人而言，我的经历是，当你已经有了伴侣，再开始一段新的恋情时，感觉会很奇怪，至少对我来说是这样。是的。
[00:18:29.320] And it feels completely different from starting something new when you're single. And I think the main difference is like when I'm in a relationship and I want to start something new, my thought is always like, oh, should I ask James if he also wants to join? Or like, should I see if he's interested in doing this? And that's always like the first check for me. It's never that like he insists on being asked every time I start something. Like I think it's more of like me doing it. But I'm always evaluating if this is going to be something we do together or if it's going
[00:18:29.320] 这和单身时开始新事物的感觉完全不同。我觉得最大的区别在于，当我恋爱后想开始新事物时，我总是会想，哦，我应该问问詹姆斯是否也想加入吗？或者，我应该看看他是否对此感兴趣吗？这始终是我首先要考虑的问题。他从来不会每次我做某件事都坚持要我问他。我觉得更多的是我主动去做。但我总是会评估这件事是否适合我们一起做，或者它是否适合我们两个人。
[00:18:58.220] to be something that he doesn't want to do, therefore I do by myself. Do you feel that way? Or is this like a is this like a me thing? No, no, I definitely feel that way. There's sometimes where it's like, yeah, maybe I'm going to do something new. And then there's this part of my brain that's like, damn, should I like invite my boyfriend? It's a little war between the selfish side and the relationship side. It's like, oh, but like, what if I just want this thing to be my thing? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:18:58.220] 做他不想做的事，所以我就自己做了。你有这种感觉吗？还是说这只是我个人的想法？不，不，我绝对有这种感觉。有时候我会想，嗯，也许我可以尝试一些新的东西。然后我脑子里又会冒出一个念头，哎，我该不该邀请我男朋友？这就像一场自私和感情之间的拉锯战。就好像，哦，但是，如果我只是想让这件事成为我自己的事呢？是啊，是啊。
[00:19:28.260] I almost feel like in an archaic way, like it's easier when the activities are like very gendered. I guess like an easy example is not a ton of guys commit to like a yoga routine, you know? So then it would be very natural for me to be like, oh, I'm going to Core Power and then not have to be like, do you want to come? Like, do you want to embark on this yoga journey? Yeah. But I don't know if I were to suddenly get into like baseball or something like I would feel obligated to be like, oh, we should play together.
[00:19:28.260] 我感觉，从某种程度上来说，如果活动带有明显的性别色彩，参与起来反而更容易。举个简单的例子，很少有男生会坚持练瑜伽，你知道吗？所以，如果我说“我要去Core Power”，我就会很自然地答应，不用问“你想来吗？”或者“你想开始这段瑜伽之旅吗？”。但如果我突然迷上棒球之类的运动，我可能就会觉得有义务说“哦，我们应该一起打球”。
[00:19:56.780] James is like, how could you not invite me to sports? Yeah, exactly. That's very fair. But on the flip side, well, I don't know if it's like flip side, but like in another scenario, what about something that you used to do alone or with a group of people now that you're in a relationship? Do you invite your partner in or do you keep it as your own activity? So I guess like, for example, your book club.
[00:19:56.780] 詹姆斯会说，你怎么能不邀请我一起参加运动呢？是啊，没错。这很合理。但反过来说，嗯，我不知道这算不算反过来，但换个角度想，如果你现在有伴侣了，你会邀请你的伴侣一起做以前独自一人或和一群朋友一起做的事情，还是继续保持单身？比如说，你们的读书俱乐部。
[00:20:26.680] Right. Did you ever invite James to it? So for our book club, it's kind of funny because it's four core members. Two of the members on our book club are together. Like they're engaged. The other two, it's like me and this other guy. Yeah. Obviously, I have James and then our other book club member has his wife as well. So it's kind of like a core group of four readers. And then we have the two people who are adjacent, but not, you know, a core member. Right.
[00:20:26.680] 对。你邀请过詹姆斯吗？我们读书俱乐部挺有意思的，因为核心成员只有四个。其中两个成员是情侣，他们订婚了。另外两个，就是我和另一个人。嗯，当然，我和詹姆斯，还有我们另一个读书俱乐部成员的妻子。所以我们算是四个核心读者。然后还有两个人关系比较近，但不是核心成员。对。
[00:20:56.680] So we do this thing called like book and movie club where allegedly like the other two people are supposed to watch the movies of the books that we read. So they're kind of like built into the concept, you know, but they don't come to our meetings. They really just come for like holiday gatherings or when we do dinners or we have like an annual end of year party that we do where we'll go over presentations and stuff. So they'll always be there. I think that's like actually a pretty healthy example of like having something that is like
[00:20:56.680] 所以我们搞了个叫“读书电影俱乐部”的活动，名义上是另外两个人要看我们读过的书对应的电影。所以他们算是这个活动的一部分，你知道，但他们不会来参加我们的例会。他们只会在节日聚会、聚餐或者年终派对之类的场合出现，在那些派对上我们会回顾之前的作品等等。所以他们总会在场。我觉得这其实是个挺好的例子，说明这种活动应该如何平衡……
[00:21:26.580] sacred to you and incorporating your partner and having them feel included without forcing the concept. Right. Because I feel like if I were to be like, James, this means a lot to me. Like I want you to read and be a part of our book club. Like we would maybe both end up miserable where I'm like forcing him to read and he doesn't want to read. Yeah. On the flip side, like I think if James were to have something as close to his heart and
[00:21:26.580] 对你来说神圣的事情，以及让你的伴侣参与其中，让他感受到被重视，而不是强迫他。没错。因为我觉得如果我说：“詹姆斯，这对我意义重大。我希望你读，希望你加入我们的读书俱乐部。”我们俩最后可能都会很痛苦，因为我强迫他读书，而他根本不想读。是啊。另一方面，我觉得如果詹姆斯有一件对他来说非常重要的事情，
[00:21:52.520] as like important as, you know, my book club is to me and he didn't even try to introduce me to people or like try to incorporate me at all. Like I would also be kind of sad, you know, like I guess the other example is his gaming group where you also are in that group and like play games with this group of people all the time. I have been invited to play games, but I'm not expected to always be there. And that's like the balance that I enjoy, you know. Don't worry, James doesn't even play in that group anymore.
[00:21:52.520] 就像我的读书俱乐部对我来说一样重要，你知道，他甚至都没试着把我介绍给其他人，或者让我融入其中。这让我有点难过，你知道吗？另一个例子是他的游戏小组，你也在那个小组里，经常和他们一起玩游戏。我被邀请过，但他们并不要求我每次都参加。我喜欢这种平衡，你知道吗？别担心，詹姆斯现在已经不参加那个小组了。
[00:22:22.300] That's true. Okay, wait, but also rewind. You guys make presentations for your book club? It's like funny shit. We give out like awards, you know. Oh, okay. I was like, damn, why is this sounding like homework club? I think it makes sense that you want to introduce this like activity to your partner in the sense of like, this is what I like to do. And these are like some of the friends that I do it with.
[00:22:22.300] 没错。好吧，等等，再倒回去一下。你们读书会要做展示？挺搞笑的。我们还会颁奖什么的，你知道的。哦，好吧。我当时就想，怎么听起来像作业辅导班？我觉得你想把这个活动介绍给你的伴侣，比如跟他说“这是我喜欢做的事，这些是我一起做的朋友”，这很合理。
[00:22:52.580] But then maybe my fear is what if it becomes whether you realize it or not, it becomes something that they are a part of. And then suddenly like you don't have any more things that are just sacred to yourself. Yeah, I think that's fair. Because it does happen a lot in real life, right? Like sometimes you're like, oh, I'll just bring this person to this one hangout or this one thing just so that you could see like what I like to do in my own time.
[00:22:52.580] 但我担心的是，不管你有没有意识到，如果事情发展到他们也参与其中，那会怎么样？然后突然之间，你就再也没有真正属于你自己的神圣事物了。嗯，我觉得这很合理。因为这种情况在现实生活中确实经常发生，对吧？有时候你会想，哦，我带这个人去参加某个聚会或者某个活动，只是想让他看看我平时喜欢做什么。
[00:23:20.880] And then it snowballs into like they're in the group chat now. Like, you know, they're heavily involved in the planning and they're like hanging out without you even when you're not free sometimes, et cetera, et cetera. Like it does end up like that sometimes. But you're like, but that's ideal. But there's nothing wrong with that. But I think in the ideal world, it would just work out so that you don't have to communicate and things would just settle exactly where you want it to be.
[00:23:20.880] 然后事情就像滚雪球一样越滚越大，最后他们好像也加入了群聊。你知道，他们深度参与计划，有时候就算你没空，他们也会背着你一起玩，等等等等。有时候事情确实会发展成这样。你会想，但这很理想啊。这也没什么错。但我觉得在理想情况下，一切都会水到渠成，你根本不需要沟通，事情就能按照你想要的方式发展下去。
[00:23:48.860] But I guess in real life, like maybe you would have to communicate that to your partner. Be like, this is something that I love when you like come by and like watch or like sit in on or whatever. But I do want this to be my own separate thing. Wow, these words are so foreign. Like I feel so strange coming out of my mouth. Words never before spoken. I guess there's also like the balance adding on to the communication part.
[00:23:48.860] 但我想在现实生活中，你可能需要跟伴侣沟通。比如，你可以说：“我很喜欢你过来一起看或者参与进来什么的。但我希望这能成为我自己的专属空间。” 哇，这些话听起来好陌生。感觉从我嘴里说出来好奇怪。这些话我以前从来没说过。我想，沟通中也需要找到平衡点。
[00:24:16.640] So one example I can think of is my boyfriend and I play golf together all the time. But he also has other friends who play golf with him. And so sometimes if he's like, oh, I'm going to go play like golf with a couple of the boys. Do you want to come? I'm like, you just go have your boy time or whatever. Right, right. But then sometimes I'm like, wait, I want to come. But then the difference is that we also have the golf time that is just us or it's like
[00:24:16.640] 我能想到的一个例子就是我和我男朋友经常一起打高尔夫。但他也有其他朋友跟他一起打。所以有时候他会说：“哦，我要和几个哥们儿去打高尔夫，你想一起去吗？” 我会说：“你就去享受你的哥们儿时光吧。” 好吧，好吧。但有时候我也会说：“等等，我也想去。” 但区别在于，我们也会单独一起打高尔夫，或者……
[00:24:45.180] the ones that like we plan together. That's like mandatory attendance for both of us. And then if it's like golf time that he's planned with other people, that's like completely optional attendance from my side. Yeah, and I think that's a very good point. Like even within an activity, a whole activity doesn't have to be fully yours or fully ours or fully theirs. You can also kind of split it up so that there's a healthy balance.
[00:24:45.180] 比如我们一起计划的活动，对我们俩来说都算是必须参加。但如果是他跟其他人安排的打高尔夫之类的活动，那我完全可以不参加。嗯，我觉得你说得很有道理。即使是同一项活动，也不一定非得完全属于你、我们或者他们。你可以把它分成几部分，这样就能保持一种健康的平衡。
[00:25:13.680] But I think the most ideal thing in my mind is like both parties need to have somewhat equal level and like quantities of activities that they keep for themselves. Mm hmm. There was a time in my life where I felt like there wasn't a ton of individual things going on for me. And then James had a ton of social things, you know, just like exercise and like all these other activities that he was a part of. And when I felt that imbalance of like, oh, he's always going out to do his own thing.
[00:25:13.680] 但我认为最理想的情况是，双方都需要拥有数量和水平大致相当的个人活动。嗯。我曾经有一段时间感觉自己没什么个人活动可做。而詹姆斯有很多社交活动，比如锻炼，还有其他各种各样的活动。当我感觉到这种不平衡的时候，我就觉得，哦，他总是出去做他自己的事。
[00:25:43.420] And then I'm kind of at home or maybe only have a couple of things going on. I just remember it felt like really, really bad. So I think being mindful of like that general balance in your relationship is always kind of key as well. That makes sense. And I think this is where the importance of you mentioned like a boys day or like a boys hangout. And we talked previously about all the girl strips that's been happening for us lately. I feel like those things are truly sacred, like untouchable.
[00:25:43.420] 然后我就待在家里，或者可能只有几件事要做。我只记得当时感觉糟透了。所以我觉得，在一段关系中保持这种整体平衡也至关重要。这很有道理。我觉得这就是你之前提到的“男生日”或“男生聚会”的重要性所在。我们之前也聊过最近我们之间发生的那些女生聚会。我觉得那些聚会真的非常神圣，就像是不可触碰的。
[00:26:12.920] You know what I mean? Yes. I would never want to like intrude on a boys hangout, you know, if. If my boyfriend and his boys want to hang out, whatever, I'll be like, I'll gladly stay at home. Dude, there was this one time I guess I didn't realize it was like a boys hangout, but then it kind of was. James had invited a couple of people over and then as they were filing in and like setting up in our living room, I was like, oh, God, like I'm getting some like dark energy here.
[00:26:12.920] 你懂我的意思吧？是的。我绝对不会想去打扰男生聚会，你知道，如果我男朋友和他的哥们儿想出去玩，随便吧，我宁愿待在家里。哥们儿，有一次我当时没意识到那是男生聚会，但后来确实有点像。詹姆斯邀请了几个朋友过来，他们陆续进来，在我们客厅里摆弄东西的时候，我就觉得，我的天，感觉气氛有点不对劲。
[00:26:40.580] And then I just immediately ejected myself from the hangout and I like slowly withered away into the bedroom. Oh, my God. And later I was like, damn, like this is what it feels like to be at like a guys hangout as a girl. You know what I mean? I'm like, there's too much testosterone. The hangout barely even started and you're like, I need to leave. Yeah. And then I heard them in the living room. They're like, oh, Jisoo doesn't want to hang out with us. And then in the bedroom with the door shut, I was like shaking my head. No.
[00:26:40.580] 然后我就立刻退出了聚会，慢慢地躲回了卧室。我的天哪。后来我就想，哎，这就是女生参加男生聚会的感觉吗？你懂我的意思吗？感觉雄性荷尔蒙太浓了。聚会还没开始，你就觉得，我得走了。是啊。然后我听到他们在客厅里说，Jisoo不想和我们一起玩。然后我在卧室里关上门，摇摇头。不。
[00:27:09.600] Absolutely not. Yeah. And I feel like even if you might not have as many like solo activities to do in a relationship, having those like girls nights slash boys nights are definitely crucial. I mean, it doesn't even have to be like a girls night necessarily, but it's like a night with you and your friends. Right. Right. I guess that's when you're really your own unit.
[00:27:09.600] 绝对不是。是啊。我觉得就算恋爱中你可能没那么多独处的时间，但偶尔和闺蜜/哥们儿聚会也绝对很重要。我的意思是，不一定非得是闺蜜聚会，但就是和朋友们一起度过的夜晚。对。对。我觉得那时候你才能真正做回自己。
[00:27:34.080] So I feel like, you know, as your relationship progresses and you go through life and other people also have their own relationships, people start moving in these like units of two. That's kind of like your default in a sense. I mean, like weddings are so top of mind lately because I've been going to so many, but I feel like that is a perfect example where a lot of people are coupled up or they have like family
[00:27:34.080] 所以我觉得，你知道，随着感情的深入，随着生活阅历的增长，再加上其他人也有自己的感情生活，人们开始以两人一组的形式生活。这在某种程度上就像是默认模式。比如，最近我参加了很多婚礼，所以婚礼成了我关注的焦点，我觉得婚礼就是一个很好的例子，很多人都有伴侣或者有家人陪伴。
[00:28:03.680] you know, all of that stuff. And you're generally moving in these like units of two. But when you're just like having a night with friends, no significant others joining, then it feels like you can embody yourself again and not have to like, you know, be presented as two people. You get to be presented as one person. True. Dude, I feel this like really starkly when I meet someone new for the first time as like
[00:28:03.680] 你知道，就是那些事儿。而且你通常都是两人一组地行动。但如果你只是和朋友们出去玩，没有另一半陪同，那感觉就像你可以重新做回自己，不用再像以前那样，以两个人的身份示人。你可以以一个人的身份示人。没错。哥们儿，我第一次见到新朋友的时候，这种感觉尤其强烈。
[00:28:31.840] just myself versus meeting people as like a couple in like a non-work setting. I am very used to meeting new people with James next to me. So we have our like whole introduction and everything like down. It's like a script, you know? And then when I meet someone as a solo person, I'm just like, whoa, like this is crazy. You don't even know me. Yeah. Wait, that's so true. Now that you mentioned the like script, because there's like different subsets of questions
[00:28:31.840] 单独一个人和以情侣身份在非工作场合认识人完全是两码事。我非常习惯和詹姆斯一起认识新朋友。我们已经有完整的自我介绍流程了，就像剧本一样，你知道吗？然后当我独自一人去见别人时，我就会想，哇，这太疯狂了。你甚至都不认识我。是啊。等等，你说得太对了。既然你提到了“剧本”，因为确实有很多不同的问题类型。
[00:28:58.360] that you're asked when you're one person versus when you're with your partner. Oh, how'd you two meet? How long have you been dating? You know, it's all about like you two. Yeah. Versus when you're meeting someone just as you. It's like, oh, well, tell me about yourself. Like, what are you interested in? Right, right. What do you like do? You know, all that kind of stuff. It's really interesting. And honestly, like recently I had this coming to moment where with all of these girls trips
[00:28:58.360] 当你独自一人时，人们会问你很多问题；而当你和伴侣在一起时，人们则会问你很多问题。比如，你会问“你们俩是怎么认识的？”“你们交往多久了？”你知道，这些问题都围绕着你们两个人。是啊。而当你单独和别人见面时，人们会问“哦，那跟我说说你自己吧。”比如，“你对什么感兴趣？”“你喜欢做什么？”你知道，诸如此类的问题。这真的很有意思。说实话，最近我突然意识到这一点，因为我和很多女孩一起旅行……
[00:29:26.440] and, you know, hangouts with my friends and etc. I remembered these other personalities that I have that live inside me. And not to sound like I'm too in my head or whatever, but I do feel like every individual person has all these different facets and sides of them that come out when you're interacting with different groups of people. And when you're in like a long term relationship or like a marriage, especially for me and
[00:29:26.440] 你知道，和朋友们聚会什么的。我突然想起了我内心深处还住着的其他几个人格。我不想显得自己想太多，但我确实觉得每个人都有不同的面向和侧面，会在和不同群体的人互动时展现出来。尤其是在一段长期的恋爱关系或婚姻中，对我来说更是如此。
[00:29:51.800] James, I feel like we are so close and we share so many people in our social network. I am so used to operating as like a household personality. Like I am one of like a comedy duo. You know what I mean? Like sometimes that's how it feels. Going to bachelorette trips and like meeting new people and being around people that are normally not in my life and presenting myself as like a individual person. I was like, whoa, I forgot I had this like personality.
[00:29:51.800] 詹姆斯，我觉得我们关系特别好，社交圈里有很多共同好友。我太习惯扮演那种“家庭主妇/主夫”的角色了，就像是喜剧二人组里的一个。你懂我的意思吗？有时候就是这种感觉。参加单身派对，认识新朋友，和那些平时不在我生活中出现的人待在一起，还要展现出自己独特的个性。我突然意识到，哇，我都忘了自己还有这种个性了。
[00:30:20.200] It was like new character unlocked within myself. And I think it felt very like healthy and kind of exciting to an extent. A dormant volcano coming back alive or some shit. But it was a good reminder of why these things are so important, even if they're not instinctive for me. Like I still need to seek them out, do them and participate, you know? Yeah. You're like, I don't need James here to crack this joke. I was like, dude, I forgot. I was like this type of person, like just unhinged. Yeah.
[00:30:20.200] 感觉就像我内心深处解锁了一个新角色。我觉得这感觉很健康，某种程度上也挺令人兴奋的。就像一座沉睡的火山重新喷发一样。但这也让我意识到，即使这些事情对我来说并非本能，它们仍然非常重要。我仍然需要去寻找它们，去做它们，去参与它们，你知道吗？是啊。你会想，我不需要詹姆斯在这儿讲这个笑话。我当时就想，老兄，我忘了。我就是那种人，有点儿神经质。是啊。
[00:30:49.200] And actually, now that you mention it, that also makes me think about at work. I only know my coworkers as their single selves, if that makes sense. Or they're like lone unit, you know? Right, right, right. I haven't seen a handful of them with their partner. You know, sometimes the vibe is a little different when their partner is there. As we've been talking about, you're operating in a different type of unit. Right. And then you get to see like different sides of them.
[00:30:49.200] 确实，你这么一说，也让我想到了工作上的事。我只见过同事们单身的样子，这么说你能理解吗？或者说，他们就像孤家寡人，你知道吗？对，对，对。我几乎没见过他们和伴侣在一起。你知道，有时候伴侣在场的时候，气氛会有点不一样。就像我们刚才说的，你身处一个不同的团队。没错。然后你就能看到他们不同的侧面。
[00:31:14.200] There's this one coworker who sits next to me and we talk a lot and we're pretty close, but I've never seen her husband. And I'm like, that's just a whole aspect of her life that I just don't know. Dude, honestly, that's a good point because I feel like I've heard so much about like, you know how at work you just like gossip or like chat or not always bad things, but just like day-to-day things and stories that come up. So every time I've met like a coworker's SO, I'm always going into it like knowing so much
[00:31:14.200] 我有个同事就坐在我旁边，我们经常聊天，关系也挺好的，但我从来没见过她老公。我就想，这可是她生活中我完全不了解的一部分啊。哥们儿，说真的，你说的太对了，因为我觉得我听过太多关于她老公的八卦，你知道的，在公司里，大家喜欢闲聊八卦，也不全是坏事，就是一些日常琐事和故事。所以每次见到同事的另一半，我都会觉得自己已经了解了很多。
[00:31:43.840] about the way that's so true. And it's always like a balance of, do I tell them how much I know? Like, oh, you don't need to tell me what you do. I already know that already. Which I go through the whole introduction anyway. Yeah. Okay. Also, this might be a little crazy, but I don't know what everyone's, or at least in the beginning, like I didn't know what everyone's husband or partner or whatever looked like. Like, so sometimes I would like, when I walk by their desks, I walk a little slower and
[00:31:43.840] 确实如此。这总是在权衡，我该不该告诉他们我知道多少？比如，哦，你不用告诉我你是做什么的，我已经知道了。但我还是会把所有介绍都做一遍。嗯，好吧。还有，这可能有点疯狂，但我不知道每个人长什么样，或者至少一开始是这样，比如我不知道每个人的丈夫、伴侣或其他什么人长什么样。所以有时候，当我经过他们的办公桌时，我会走得慢一些，
[00:32:11.680] then I look at the photos they have on their desks. And I'm like, oh, that's what their husband looks like. Wait, that's so, I love how you could totally just ask too and be like, oh, that's such a cute photo of your family. But instead you're like Zoom 150. Wait, I literally never even thought about that. Okay. Okay. But sometimes their desk is like opposite of mine. Like, like I see the back of their divider.
[00:32:11.680] 然后我就会看他们桌上的照片。然后我就想，哦，原来他们老公长这样啊。等等，这真是……我喜欢这种感觉，你完全可以直接问，然后说，哦，这张你们全家福真可爱。但你却会用Zoom 150。等等，我之前真的从来没想过这一点。好吧，好吧。但有时候他们的办公桌摆放的位置跟我的完全相反。比如，我能看到他们隔板的背面。
[00:32:41.370] So, you know, I don't have x-ray vision. I can't be like, oh my God, that one photo on your desk. They're like, how are you seeing this right now? You're like, can you pass me that frame? Just need to take a look real quick. I know we're like cracking jokes about our solo self personalities and our like relationship self personalities. But I do want to say like, I don't think having a gap in between these two personalities is a bad thing.
[00:32:41.370] 你知道，我又不是有透视眼。我不可能一眼就看到你桌上的那张照片。他们肯定会问：“你怎么能看到这张照片的？” 我只能说：“能把那张照片递给我吗？我得赶紧看一眼。” 我知道我们经常拿自己的独处状态和恋爱状态开玩笑。但我想说的是，我觉得这两种状态之间存在差异并不是什么坏事。
[00:33:07.990] In some ways, I feel like it's a receipt of the growth that you've undergone in that relationship. For me, at least, I know there's a ton of qualities that I think have been like rectified over the years being in my relationship with James. So I think to an extent, it's almost like a badge of honor of like all these things that I've worked on that have become smoother and rounder over the years. Just wanted to caveat that it's not always negative. Yeah.
[00:33:07.990] 在某种程度上，我觉得这就像是你在那段感情中成长的证明。至少对我来说，我知道我和詹姆斯在一起的这些年里，我身上有很多缺点都得到了改善。所以我觉得在某种程度上，这就像是一枚荣誉勋章，证明我这些年来一直在努力，让很多方面都变得更加完善和圆润。不过我想补充一点，这并不总是负面的。是的。
[00:33:38.010] And I think it's so interesting too, because like we both arrive at a similar conclusion where it's like, you know, we want to have a sense of self while also being in a relationship. But our path to get here is a little different. It's like you've been in your relationship for so long. So you've had to like realize it in the relationship and like, you know, work on it, figure out like how you balance it.
[00:33:38.010] 我觉得这很有意思，因为我们俩最终都得出了类似的结论，那就是我们都想在恋爱关系中保持自我。但我们得出这个结论的过程略有不同。你和伴侣已经在一起很久了，所以你必须在恋爱关系中逐渐意识到这一点，然后努力经营，找到平衡点。
[00:34:03.350] And then I think for me, having time outside of a relationship is also very eye opening. Like that's probably where I started to realize more like, oh, well, make sure you don't lose yourself in relationships, blah, blah. So I feel like it's almost like more impressive to like be in a relationship and figure that out because it's so easy to get swept up in it all and be like, oh, everything's totally good. And I love how it is.
[00:34:03.350] 我觉得对我来说，单身一段时间也很有启发意义。大概就是在那段时间，我开始意识到，哦，要确保自己不会在恋爱关系中迷失自我，等等等等。所以我觉得，在恋爱关系中学会这一点反而更令人印象深刻，因为很容易沉浸其中，觉得一切都很美好。我喜欢这种感觉。
[00:34:31.210] And then like, you know, years down the line, you're like, oh, shoot, this is actually codependency. And it's like maybe not that healthy. But like to realize it earlier and actively acknowledge it is very impressive, I think. Well, I have to say it's definitely a work in progress still. But this is why I also have so much respect for like friends who are high school sweethearts, for example, and still have managed to carve out their own lives. It's so hard.
[00:34:31.210] 然后，你知道，几年后，你会突然意识到，哎呀，这其实是相互依赖。这可能不太健康。但我觉得，能早点意识到这一点并积极承认，非常了不起。当然，我得说，这绝对还是一个需要不断努力的过程。正因如此，我才如此敬佩那些高中时的恋人，他们至今仍然能够各自开创自己的人生。这真的很难。
[00:34:57.010] And I think the younger you were when you met your SO, like the more integrated your lives naturally are just with the passage of time and whatnot. So honestly, to me, it's really eye opening being around people like you who carve out more of that balance actively. And I just try to like emulate that in my life. You're so right, though, about like the earlier you meet, the more ingrained in each other's
[00:34:57.010] 我觉得你越年轻就遇到你的另一半，随着时间的推移，你们的生活自然而然就会融合得越深。所以说实话，对我来说，和像你这样积极努力地平衡生活的人在一起，真的让我大开眼界。我也努力在自己的生活中效仿你。你说得对，认识得越早，彼此的感情就越深厚。
[00:35:23.210] lives you are, because me and my boyfriend met more recently. So like I had my own adult routine and like independent adult life going on. And then it's like, oh, well, now that we're entering this relationship, I want to make sure I'm still protecting whatever I used to have in some aspect versus like you said, if you meet in like high school, you're barely a person yet. True.
[00:35:23.210] 你说的没错，因为我和我男朋友认识的时间比较近。我之前一直过着自己的成人生活，有自己的节奏和独立的生活。然后我就想，哦，现在我们开始这段感情了，我想确保我还能在某些方面保护好我以前拥有的东西，而不是像你说的，如果你在高中就认识了，你当时还几乎还没真正长大成人。确实如此。
[00:35:48.930] And then you have to like, while being a unit of two, still have to like find yourself. It's like a lot. I wonder if that's why like parents always are like, oh, wait until this arbitrary age to start dating just because they have seen people go through this and know it's like more of a battle. But at the same time, like I wouldn't trade meeting James in college for anything. Like it's just something that comes with the territory, I think. Yeah. Dude, I don't know.
[00:35:48.930] 然后，你们俩虽然是两个人，但还得继续寻找自我。这真的很难。我琢磨着，是不是因为这个原因，父母总是说，哦，等到某个特定的年龄再开始谈恋爱，因为他们见过别人经历这些，知道这更像是一场战斗。但同时，我又觉得在大学里遇到詹姆斯是件无比珍贵的事。我觉得，这就是人生的一部分吧。是啊，兄弟，我也不知道。
[00:36:17.610] I think my parents just wanted me to like study. They were like never date, actually. Okay. But also, I don't know about your parents, but my parents thought I would never see my high school friends again. They thought that I would be a lot closer to my college friends. Oh, I remember you said this. But like in this day and age where we're just also much more connected, we ended up just staying close to both high school and college friends. Even my parents were surprised.
[00:36:17.610] 我觉得我爸妈只是想让我专心学习。他们甚至不让我谈恋爱。好吧。不过，我不知道你爸妈怎么样，但我爸妈觉得我以后都不会再跟高中朋友联系了。他们觉得我会跟大学朋友更亲近。哦，我记得你说过这话。但在这个时代，我们之间的联系比以前紧密得多，所以我们最终还是跟高中朋友和大学朋友都保持着密切联系。连我爸妈都感到很意外。
[00:36:47.410] I think like the first few years in college slash out of college where they're like, oh, you're still really close to your high school friends. I thought you would just like forget about them. Now that you say that, I'm pretty sure I've said this on the podcast before, but it is relevant. My parents used to always say like, oh, you know, at the end of the day, when you're like 40s, 50s, friends aren't going to be as important as you think they are now. And they would always hammer that in and be like, you know, family is first.
[00:36:47.410] 我觉得大学头几年，尤其是刚毕业那几年，他们会说：“哇，你和高中朋友关系还这么好。我还以为你会把他们忘得一干二净呢。” 你这么一说，我好像之前在播客里也说过，不过确实挺相关的。我爸妈以前总是说：“说到底，等你到了四五十岁，朋友就不会像现在这么重要了。” 他们总是反复强调这一点，说家庭才是最重要的。
[00:37:17.030] Friends are really great. They're also important. But it's never going to be your number one priority. And maybe that's also why I was always like, okay, with like a 90% Venn diagram. But I mean, honestly, that is true too. Like all these things can be true. Yeah, I totally agree. And I think it's also cool. Like you mentioned before, you and I obviously come from very different perspectives on it. But I like that we are forging our own solo time and our own sense of self in our own individual ways.
[00:37:17.030] 朋友当然很棒，也很重要，但他们永远不会是你最重要的事。也许这就是为什么我总是觉得，好吧，就像维恩图里90%的内容一样。但说实话，这也没错。所有这些说法都可能成立。是的，我完全同意。而且我觉得这样也很酷。就像你之前提到的，你我在这方面显然有着截然不同的看法。但我喜欢我们都能以各自的方式创造属于自己的独处时间和自我认知。
