[00:00:00.000] Welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal. Today's topic is everybody's favorite thing at work, I think, and that is PTO, so pay time off, and all of the unspoken rules that come with taking PTO. I feel like on a surface level,
[00:00:00.000] 欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。今天的话题是每个人在工作中最喜欢的事情，我想，那就是带薪休假，也就是带薪假期，以及所有与休假相关的潜规则。我觉得从表面上看，
[00:00:30.180] PTO is unproblematic, like you're just taking some time off and you've earned it, right? Every paycheck you've earned a couple of hours to put towards your future vacations, but there's some weird, silent, unspoken rules that come with taking PTO that I feel like you really start to know and feel the longer you work at your company. Right now, we'll talk about earned PTO,
[00:00:30.180] 带薪休假（PTO）本身没什么问题，就像你休息一段时间，而且是你应得的，对吧？你每次领工资都会攒下几个小时，用来攒钱准备未来的假期。但是，关于带薪休假，有一些奇怪的、不成文的规则，我觉得你在公司工作的时间越长，就越能了解和体会到。现在，我们就来谈谈已获得的带薪休假。
[00:00:54.540] because we both don't have unlimited PTO, so we can't speak too much to that, but I totally agree that there's definitely a feeling of, I've earned this PTO, so you can't just like take it away from me or deny me. And I think for the most part, that's usually the case, but you're right, there's definitely moments where you're like, oh, maybe I shouldn't have taken PTO in this moment, or like
[00:00:54.540] 因为我们俩的带薪休假都不是无限的，所以我们在这方面不太了解，但我完全同意，确实会有这样一种感觉：这些带薪休假是我应得的，你不能随便剥夺我的休假权利。我觉得大多数情况下确实如此，但你说得对，肯定也会有那么一些时候，你会想，哦，也许我不应该在这个时候休假，或者……
[00:01:20.700] this particular time is a bad time and it could make me look bad if I'm like forcing my way into PTO. Totally. And that actually brings up something funny. So I've had a couple of bosses in my career so far, and one of the bosses that I had, we were on a very small team. It was basically my boss and me. So anytime either of us took PTO, we would want there to be coverage within the team. So taking PTO was,
[00:01:20.700] 现在这个时期情况很糟糕，如果我硬要请假，可能会显得我很没面子。确实如此。说起来还有件挺有意思的事。我职业生涯至今有过几个老板，其中一个老板手下我们团队很小，基本上就我和我老板两个人。所以，我们俩只要有一个人请假，就得确保团队里有人顶替。因此，请假……
[00:01:50.740] of course, a earned right, but it was also something that required a little bit of coordination. Like, hey, I'm going to take this time off. Does that work with you? How does that fit with like our team's goals for the year? So I was very used to having an open communication about it with my boss. But a little bit later in my career, I had a different boss. And at the time that this boss became my boss, our team had since grown. So there are multiple people on the team, a little bit better PTO coverage,
[00:01:50.740] 当然，休假是应得的权利，但也需要一些协调。比如，我会说：“嘿，我要休假一段时间。你那边可以吗？这跟我们团队的年度目标契合吗？”所以我很习惯和老板就休假事宜进行公开沟通。但后来，我的老板换了。而当这位新老板接手我的工作时，我们的团队也壮大了。现在团队里有好几个人，休假制度也更加完善了。
[00:02:17.080] I would say. So maybe a little bit less coordination required. And I remember once I was like, hey, I'm thinking of taking these days off. Is that cool with you? If so, I'll like put it into the system for approval. And that boss was like, oh, I'm not used to people asking me for like permission to take PTO, which I thought was an interesting comment. Because in my head, I was like, I guess you could take it as like, I'm asking for permission. But really what it is, is the team
[00:02:17.080] 我觉得是这样。所以可能需要的协调工作会少一些。我记得有一次，我跟老板说：“嘿，我打算请几天假，你觉得可以吗？如果可以，我就把它提交到系统里审批。” 老板说：“哦，我不太习惯有人来问我能不能请假。” 我觉得这话挺有意思的。因为我心里想的是，你可能会觉得我是在征求你的同意。但实际上，这是团队合作的结果。
[00:02:43.880] going to be okay if I take this PTO. And that was something that was so ingrained into me with my smaller team experience. Yeah. So since then, I'm kind of like, I guess I should word it less so like, oh, is it cool if I take this time off and more like, I'm going to submit this, let me know if there's anything you need me to do beforehand, so that it doesn't seem as permission. But at the same time, I was just like, bruh, like, let's be real. There are kind of permissions that come with
[00:02:43.880] 如果我休这个年假，应该没问题吧？这在我之前的小团队工作经历中根深蒂固。是啊。所以从那以后，我就觉得，我应该换个说法，别再问“我能休假吗？”，而是说“我会提交申请，如果有什么需要我提前做的，请告诉我”，这样听起来就不会像是在征求你的同意。但同时，我又觉得，兄弟，说真的，休假确实需要一些许可。
[00:03:09.220] like asking for time off. A little bit. I think I'm similar to your first situation where my team that has similar function with me, so my more immediate team is definitely smaller. So, you know, if I'm on PTO, and my boss is on PTO, it might be a rough time for people who need like
[00:03:09.220] 就像请假一样。有点像。我觉得我的情况和你第一种情况类似，我的团队成员和我职能相似，所以我的直接团队成员肯定比较少。所以，你知道，如果我休假，我的老板也休假，那对那些需要人手的人来说可能会比较难熬。
[00:03:30.300] design help. Right. But yeah, I think what I do do is I really take note of when we have events coming up at work, or we know that stretch of time might be busy time. And usually I won't schedule any PTO during that time. And I usually try to just do it towards like the end of the year, or when I know it'll be a little more chill, especially if it's like right after a big event
[00:03:30.300] 设计方面的帮助。没错。不过，我确实会留意公司近期的活动安排，或者我们知道那段时间可能会比较忙。通常情况下，我不会在那段时间安排任何年假。我一般会尽量在年底或者我知道会比较轻松的时候安排，尤其是在大型活动之后。
[00:03:59.860] or a big deadline. Those are like optimal times because usually it's a little more chill. You just cleared your plate of all your tasks. And it's a good refresher, I think. I think you're right in that like there's key weeks that are better for taking PTO and key weeks that maybe aren't as appropriate. There are definitely some important months in my current job where I'm like, okay, I should probably try not to take vacation on these times. But another thing that
[00:03:59.860] 或者赶上一个重要的截止日期。这些时候休假是最佳选择，因为通常比较轻松。你刚刚完成了所有工作。而且我觉得这能让你好好放松一下。你说得对，有些关键周更适合休假，有些关键周可能不太适合。就我目前的工作而言，确实有一些重要的月份，我会想，好吧，我最好还是不要在这些时候休假。但还有一点……
[00:04:27.180] I noticed is oftentimes parents will sort of be forced to take PTO like at the same time. So like during spring break or some of vacation, I know a lot of parents kind of have to keep their kids entertained. So then for me, if a lot of people on my team who are like parents have to take these times off, it's probably best if I don't take that time off, if I can avoid it. That way there's like someone on
[00:04:27.180] 我注意到，很多时候父母会被迫同时请假。比如春假或者其他假期，我知道很多父母都得想办法照顾孩子。所以，如果我团队里很多为人父母的同事都得请假，那我最好还是尽量避免请假。这样至少团队里还有人能顶替我。
[00:04:51.700] our team who's kind of able to answer questions or whatnot. Wait, that's so true. Especially if someone's a parent and their kid gets sick, then they like usually have to take PTO. Right. Or if there's just like any sort of complication with these kids, I feel like it's a whole added element. Luckily on my team though, I think there's only like two or three people in my bigger team
[00:04:51.700] 我们团队里有人能解答问题什么的。等等，确实如此。特别是如果有人是家长，孩子生病了，他们通常就得请假。没错。或者如果孩子有什么其他问题，我觉得这会增加很多负担。不过幸运的是，我们团队里，好像只有两三个人是这样。
[00:05:16.780] who have kids. So there's like less just random needed PTO that's being taken. But I'm like, dude, it's tough. I see sometimes they're like, oh my God, it's like six season. My kid got sick. So I'm going to stay home this week because I don't want to like spread the sickness or I'm going to have to like take PTO this day because I need to take my kid to the doctor. I'm like, wow, it's like double work for them.
[00:05:16.780] 有孩子的人请假比较多，所以他们请的假也少一些。但我心想，老兄，这太难了。我有时候看到他们会说，天哪，都第六个季度了，我孩子生病了。所以我这周要待在家里，因为我不想传染给别人，或者我得请一天假带孩子去看医生。我就想，哇，这对他们来说简直是双倍的负担。
[00:05:41.080] Wait, holy shit. This is like low-key blowing my mind because to me, PTO is so vacation focused. I'm like, oh, which state or like which country do I want to be in when I take my 20 days off this year or whatever. But you're so right. Like when someone is a parent, it's not really your time. It's like time that you have to allocate for your family. And that kind of like, I don't know, it takes the sparkle away from it a little bit.
[00:05:41.080] 等等，我的天哪。这简直让我醍醐灌顶，因为在我看来，带薪休假（PTO）完全就是度假。我以前总是想，哦，我今年休20天假的时候想去哪个州或者哪个国家呢？但你说得太对了。当了父母之后，时间就不完全属于自己了。你必须把时间分配给家人。这样一来，感觉就像，嗯，有点儿让假期失去了光彩。
[00:06:07.400] Dude, don't worry. My coworkers who do have kids, they mostly do take PTO still for vacation. But I think there's just like the occasional one or two where it's like, hey, I'm sick. So I'm going to stay home today or like kids sick and like don't want to spread the germs. It's usually still vacation. So don't worry. I would say the ratio is probably like 95 to like 5%. Okay. You got me a little scared for a sec. I was like, oh no, my vacation.
[00:06:07.400] 哥们儿，别担心。我那些有孩子的同事，大部分还是会请年假的。不过偶尔也会有一两个，比如“哎呀，我病了，今天在家休息”或者“孩子病了，不想传染给别人”，但通常还是会请假。所以别担心。我觉得大概是95%比5%吧。好吧，你刚才吓了我一跳，我还想着“糟了，我的假期怎么办”。
[00:06:39.860] I think the good thing is that right now, like work is relatively flexible with working from home and coming into the office. And I think at least my team is very, very understanding. We're mostly a team of women. So we have a lot of trust and a lot of understanding between us all. So it's like, oh, if you know, she has to go take care of her kid, totally get it, blah, blah, blah. I guess that's
[00:06:39.860] 我觉得好的一点是，现在的工作方式比较灵活，可以居家办公也可以来办公室。而且我觉得至少我的团队非常非常理解。我们团队大部分都是女性，所以我们彼此之间有很多信任和理解。比如，如果她要去照顾孩子，我们完全理解，等等等等。我想这就是……
[00:07:06.200] like another part of the whole PTO thing, right? Like if you build up a good relationship with your team, with your boss, and you have a lot of trust, then it's a little easier to have to take last minute PTO if something happens. Or maybe you take a lot of PTO, then it's like easier for them to understand what's going on with you if you actually have a relationship with them.
[00:07:06.200] 这就像休假制度的另一个方面，对吧？如果你和你的团队、你的老板建立了良好的关系，彼此之间有很多信任，那么如果发生什么事需要临时休假，就更容易一些。或者，如果你经常休假，那么如果你和他们建立了良好的关系，他们就更容易理解你的情况。
[00:07:32.220] Oh, yeah. I kind of see it more like it depends on the work that you do. If you're doing a lot of time sensitive, super critical effects, all these, you know, it's like a dependency for all these other teams or whatever, then I feel like maybe there's more rules and more structure. Luckily, I feel like certain companies in tech or like certain teams, even within these companies do tend to be more chill
[00:07:32.220] 哦，是的。我觉得这更多取决于你做的工作。如果你做的是很多时间紧迫、至关重要的特效，比如涉及到其他团队的依赖关系之类的，那我觉得规则和结构可能会更多一些。幸运的是，我觉得某些科技公司，或者即使是这些公司内部的某些团队，工作氛围也往往比较轻松。
[00:07:55.660] and more flexible. So I feel like it's easier to take longer weeks off or maybe close consecutive weeks of PTO off if you are a part of like a more chill team. But I know I've definitely been on teams where it's like, oh, even when you're off, you kind of like check your phone and things like that. So that's not super pleasant. Yeah, that's very true. I think I'm very lucky that my team is all
[00:07:55.660] 而且更灵活。所以我觉得，如果你在一个比较轻松的团队里，就更容易请更长的假，或者连续几周休年假。但我知道我之前也待过一些团队，就算休息的时候，你也会忍不住看看手机什么的。那种感觉不太好。是啊，确实如此。我觉得我很幸运，我的团队……
[00:08:20.540] very encouraging of taking your proper vacation. They're like, please don't check your phone. We've got you covered. Don't bring your laptop, all of that kind of stuff. And I'm like, wow, that's like very admirable. And I like that we can support each other like that. And we have the trust to do that. Yeah, I think I personally, though, still bring my work phone with me just in case, just in
[00:08:20.540] 他们非常鼓励大家好好休假。他们会说，请不要查看手机，我们会照顾好你。不要带笔记本电脑，等等。我觉得这真是太棒了。我喜欢我们能够这样互相支持，并且彼此信任。不过，就我个人而言，我还是会带着工作手机，以防万一。
[00:08:44.240] case there's emergencies. Yeah. Also, to clarify, the trust I mean here is that I can trust my team members to pick up any emergencies that might happen. I bring my phone just in case. But realistically, I probably don't ever have to do anything. Because if you know, a last minute project were to come in while I'm on PTO, I know my team members would be able to handle it. That's such a good point. And I
[00:08:44.240] 以防万一有紧急情况。是的。另外，澄清一下，我这里说的信任是指我可以信任我的团队成员处理任何可能发生的紧急情况。我带手机以防万一。但实际上，我可能永远都不需要做任何事。因为你知道，如果我休假期间突然接到一个项目，我知道我的团队成员能够处理好。这一点说得太对了。而且我
[00:09:10.980] actually think that's a part of PTO hygiene almost to of like setting your team up for success while you take PTO. And it might vary when I was like a very entry level, like junior level employee, really the PTO coverage that I had wouldn't be significant, right? It's like, oh, here's like this minor task I was working on. Here are some notes about it if anyone asks. But truly, like the longer you are
[00:09:10.980] 实际上，我认为这几乎是休假管理的一部分，就像是在休假期间为团队的顺利运作做好准备一样。当然，情况可能有所不同。当我还是个非常初级的员工时，我的休假保障其实并不重要，对吧？就像，哦，这是我正在做的一个小任务。如果有人问起，这里有一些相关的笔记。但实际上，随着你休假时间的延长，休假保障的重要性也会逐渐显现。
[00:09:35.880] at a company or on a team, and the bigger your responsibilities grow, I feel like you do kind of have to write stuff down, instruct people on like, okay, if this comes in, here's what you would do. My learning in the last couple of years is to like write a PTO doc. Here's my recurring tasks that I would do on what day, going to people and like assigning them to be the point person for that task. And then also just like sharing that doc out to the relevant people and also to my manager,
[00:09:35.880] 在公司或团队里，随着职责的增加，我觉得确实需要把事情写下来，指导其他人，比如，如果遇到这种情况，应该怎么做。我过去几年学到的一点是，要写一份休假申请文档。文档里会列出我每天要完成的重复性任务，并指定负责人来处理。然后，还要把这份文档分享给相关人员，包括我的经理。
[00:10:03.800] so that she knows, okay, this person is taking on Monday reporting, like this person is taking on Wednesday reporting, so that everyone is kind of in the loop. Oh my god, yours is like more intense than my prep. I'm just like, hey boss, I'll be gone. I think I finished all my work, but this person might email you about this and I let them know that I'll be gone. Hey, that's PTO hygiene right there.
[00:10:03.800] 这样她就知道，比如，这个人负责周一的汇报，那个人负责周三的汇报，这样大家都能了解情况。我的天，你的准备工作比我的还细致。我一般就跟老板说，我要走了。我觉得我的工作都做完了，但是这个人可能会发邮件问你，所以我会告诉他们我要走了。嘿，这才是休假的基本礼仪啊。
[00:10:31.060] But there was one time where I felt really bad. It was actually us. We had a planned vacation one year, you, me, and a couple of our other friends. We had planned it, maybe it was like a year or half a year in advance, but then an event came up at my job. And it was like right after our vacation. And I was like, oh my god. And at that time, I was the only designer. I was freaking
[00:10:31.060] 但有一次我真的感觉很糟糕。其实是因为我们。有一年，你、我还有几个朋友计划了一次旅行。我们提前一年或半年就开始计划了，但后来我工作上突然冒出一个活动。而且就在我们旅行结束后不久。我当时就想，我的天哪。那时候，我是公司唯一的平面设计师。我真是崩溃了。
[00:10:59.220] out a little bit because there were like two thoughts going on. One is like, well, this vacation was planned a long time ago, so it's not like we could just cancel it and it's not just me. And I let my boss at the time know that she was very understanding. But the other part of me was like, oh no, but I don't want to just leave the team to their own devices for one and a half to two weeks,
[00:10:59.220] 当时我有点儿不知所措，因为我脑子里有两个想法。一方面，我觉得这次假期是很久以前就计划好的，不可能取消，而且也不只是我一个人这么想。我当时跟老板说了，她非常理解。但另一方面，我又觉得，不行，我不想让团队自己安排一个半到两周的时间。
[00:11:22.220] especially because I was the only designer at the time. So what I did was I told my boss at the time that I would take a couple half days so that I could make sure that we're on track to still complete our stuff by the event. But then what really worked out was that we were in the process of hiring another designer who would eventually be my senior designer. And they joined right before or maybe it was like
[00:11:22.220] 尤其是我当时是唯一的设计师。所以我跟当时的领导说我会请几个半天假，确保我们能按计划在活动前完成所有工作。但后来真正奏效的是，我们当时正在招聘另一位设计师，他最终成为了我的高级设计师。他加入的时候，大概就在活动开始前不久，或者说，大概就在活动开始前不久。
[00:11:50.200] right during our vacation. And I was like, oh, perfect. Like there is someone to cover. But I felt a bit bad because they're just joined. So they were like getting thrown into the deep end of doing stuff. But it ended up all working out. And then ever since then, our team has been better about announcing when these kinds of events would happen because that was the first time that it happened. So it was announced a little later. And I was like, oh my God, I didn't know to expect this.
[00:11:50.200] 就在我们度假期间。我当时想，哦，太好了，这样就有人可以顶替了。但我又有点担心，因为他们刚加入团队，就像被推到风口浪尖一样，一下子就得处理各种事情。不过最终一切都顺利解决了。从那以后，我们团队在发布这类事件的通知方面就做得更好了，因为那是第一次发生这种情况。所以这次通知得有点晚。我当时就想，我的天哪，我完全没想到会发生这种事。
[00:12:17.520] That's always rough when something really urgent comes up last minute and you're just like, how am I supposed to tackle all of this before my vacation? Because I'm still going on that vacation. Yeah. I don't know if you feel this way, but I feel like for me, the week before I take a week or two off is always like the craziest week because I'm going to all my coworkers and, you know, doing that whole PTO coverage spiel, but also because I want to handle all of my work and get it really wrapped up before I go.
[00:12:17.520] 最让人头疼的就是临时冒出个急事，你会想，我该怎么在休假前把这些事都处理完呢？因为我还是要去度假的。是啊。不知道你是不是也有这种感觉，但对我来说，休假前的那一周总是最忙的，因为我要跟所有同事沟通，安排休假期间的交接工作，而且我还想把自己的工作都处理完，在出发前彻底搞定。
[00:12:45.280] That week is already busy, but I've had times where something really urgent comes up and I've had to work till like 1 a.m. or something the night before my vacation while also trying to pack at the same time. So one of the things that I've noticed that some of my coworkers will do is a couple of weeks before they go on vacation. If they're like a very external facing person, they'll put in their
[00:12:45.280] 那周本来就很忙，但我有时也会遇到特别紧急的事情，不得不工作到凌晨一点，甚至在假期前一晚还要同时打包行李。所以我注意到，有些同事会在休假前几周就开始准备。如果他们是那种需要经常与外界打交道的人，他们会提前做好安排。
[00:13:09.080] signature of the email expecting to go on PTO 221 to 36 will have limited email during that time. And then of course you also do the auto reply when you're out on PTO to be like, okay, if your question is about X, Y, and Z, email this person. If it's about ABC, email this other person. So I was like, okay, it's kind of nice to like let everyone know beforehand that you're going on PTO.
[00:13:09.080] 邮件签名中会注明即将休假（221至36天），休假期间邮件收发将受到限制。当然，休假期间你还可以设置自动回复，比如，如果你的问题是关于X、Y和Z，请发邮件给这个人；如果是关于ABC，请发邮件给另一个人。所以我觉得，提前通知大家你要休假还是挺好的。
[00:13:33.520] That's a good idea. Putting in your signature upcoming PTO. One thing that I have started doing is I send out like a weekly newsletter to one of my main stakeholders. So I usually share in there, oh, upcoming PTO or like dates that I won't be available, which I think is pretty helpful. But the auto responder vacation responder is like so crucial. Well, I don't know. I think
[00:13:33.520] 这是个好主意。把你的签名加上即将到来的休假信息。我开始做的一件事是，每周给我的一个主要利益相关者发送一份简报。我通常会在里面分享即将到来的休假或者我无法工作的日期，我觉得这很有帮助。但是自动回复休假通知真的非常重要。嗯，我不知道。我觉得
[00:14:00.700] cause I haven't had any like real emergencies come up while I'm in PTO. It's always fine, but I guess it's just the fact that it's like letting people know who are reaching out to you. Like, Hey, I'll be back later. Yeah. Yeah. But one time I almost forgot to set it and I didn't bring my work laptop with me. And I was like, oh my God, can you set this thing from your phone? And luckily you could, but yeah, I was like, oh God, I need to set this right now or else what
[00:14:00.700] 因为我休假期间还没遇到什么真正的紧急情况。一切都挺好的，但我觉得关键在于，这就像是在告诉那些联系我的人，比如“嘿，我一会儿就回来”。嗯，嗯。但有一次我差点忘了设置，而且我没带工作用的笔记本电脑。我就想，天哪，可以用手机设置吗？还好可以，但我当时就想，天哪，我得马上设置，不然怎么办？
[00:14:27.700] if people email me? I feel like you also have to remember to turn it off if you didn't set the dates correctly, for example, or like if you just forget to like toggle one thing. I've gotten emails back from people where they're like, I'll be back in office on this date. And I'm like, wait, that date was like three days ago. You're back in office. Yeah. That's funny. That's actually one of my biggest fears. I'm like, what if I set the dates wrong? And like my emails don't send or like
[00:14:27.700] 如果有人给我发邮件怎么办？我觉得你还得记得把邮件关掉，比如如果你没把日期设置对，或者你只是忘了关掉某个设置。我收到过一些人的邮件，他们说“我会在这一天回办公室上班”。然后我就想，等等，那个日期是三天前了。你已经回去上班了。是啊，真搞笑。这其实是我最担心的事之一。我就想，万一我把日期设置错了怎么办？万一我的邮件发不出去怎么办？
[00:14:51.520] my emails don't stop sending. Right. But honestly, PTO coverage aside, do you have any personal guardrails on like how much PTO is too much PTO or like how much vacation is too long of a vacation or anything like that? I definitely do. I try not to take more than two weeks of PTO at a time
[00:14:51.520] 我的邮件一直不停地发送。没错。但说实话，撇开休假不谈，你个人对休假有没有什么限制，比如休假多少才算太多，或者假期多久才算太长之类的？我当然有。我尽量一次休假不超过两周。
[00:15:13.340] for vacation purposes. So that's like 10 work days, five each week. And then if you can tag on like a holiday and then that way you can save one of your PTO days. So for example, in February, there was like President's Day. If you could take PTO and tag that on, it would be like kind of nice. But yeah, generally I try not to take more than two weeks for vacation purposes. And I also try not
[00:15:13.340] 为了休假，我一般会休10个工作日，每周5天。如果能把节假日也算进去，就能省下一天带薪休假。比如，二月份有个总统日，如果能用带薪休假把总统日也算进去，那就很不错了。不过，我一般尽量不休超过两周的假。而且我也尽量不
[00:15:39.400] to take PTO too close together. So like if I took two weeks in say March or something, I probably would not try to take long PTO anything a week or longer for at least two or three months just personally. Wait, really? I feel like you took so much PTO last year.
[00:15:39.400] 休假时间太短不好。比如说，如果我在三月份休了两周假，那我个人至少两三个月内都不会再休一周或更长时间的假了。等等，真的吗？我觉得你去年休了好多假啊。
[00:16:01.600] I know, but it was because it was all very separated. So I took two weeks, I think it was either two or one and a half weeks in March. And then the next time I took PTO was in November. Oh, it's because when I travel. Oh, you were? Yeah. When I travel domestically, I usually don't take PTO because
[00:16:01.600] 我知道，但那是因为所有事情都分散在各处。所以我三月份休了两周假，我想应该是两周或者一周半。然后我下一次休假是在十一月。哦，那是因为我出差的时候。哦，你出差了？是的。我国内出差的时候通常不休假，因为
[00:16:28.120] if I'm traveling domestically, like the hours are about the same. And if I'm hanging out with friends, they probably still have work on the weekdays too. So I'm like, okay, I might as well just keep working and like get stuff done, you know, not fall behind if there's no reason to take this PTO. And then also my company usually has offices in like major cities. So I think that's another pro because I can still go into the office if needed. Yeah. I feel like it's definitely really helpful
[00:16:28.120] 如果我在国内出差，工作时间差不多。如果我和朋友出去玩，他们工作日可能也得上班。所以我就想，好吧，既然没必要休假，那我不如继续工作，把事情做完，免得耽误进度。而且我们公司通常在一些大城市都有办公室。所以我觉得这也是个好处，因为如果需要的话，我还是可以去办公室的。是的，我觉得这真的很有帮助。
[00:16:57.480] when your company has like a more flexible RTO policy or you're able to do that stuff remotely versus if you do have strict RTO policy, then it's harder to take those domestic PTO days. Yeah. But that is really nice. Then you save so much vacation time. I think I have similar rules as you, but it's hard. I feel like the older I'm getting, the harder it is to like adhere to these things because a lot of the times vacation might not be
[00:16:57.480] 如果你的公司有更灵活的轮班制度，或者允许你远程办公，而不是严格的轮班制度，那么休国内带薪休假就比较困难。是啊。不过那样真的很好。这样可以节省很多假期时间。我觉得我的规则和你差不多，但很难做到。我感觉年纪越大，就越难遵守这些规定，因为很多时候假期可能没法休。
[00:17:22.960] around my volition anymore. I might be coordinating with like a bunch of other people's schedules, especially for things like weddings and whatnot. It's up to the couple, right? To like really set the date and the location. I'm realizing it's like harder and harder to try to spread it out if it's based on someone else's plans. Yeah. But yeah, I think two and a half weeks is like the max for me. And if it's longer than that, then hopefully I'm like more tenured and feel
[00:17:22.960] 不能再完全按照我的意愿安排了。我可能要协调很多人的日程，特别是像婚礼之类的活动。最终决定权在新人手里，对吧？他们自己定日期和地点。我意识到，如果一切都得按照别人的计划来，那就越来越难安排了。是啊。不过，我觉得两周半对我来说已经是极限了。如果超过两周，那希望到时候我已经更资深一些，感觉也更轻松了。
[00:17:51.820] more comfortable booking longer PTO. Cause I think that's also, you know, the longer you're at a company and like the more PTO coverage you've picked up for someone else, I think it's easier to ask for longer vacation days in a row. But if you've been at a company for a shorter amount of time, it feels a little bad to ask for a really long vacation off, even if you have the hours. Oh, for sure. I think that's another, I guess, like personal rule. If I'm new to a team or company,
[00:17:51.820] 更愿意申请更长的带薪休假。因为我觉得，你知道，你在公司待的时间越长，替别人承担的休假工作越多，就越容易申请连续更长的假期。但如果你待的时间比较短，即使你有足够的工时，申请很长的假期也会感觉有点不好意思。哦，当然。我觉得这算是我个人的一条原则吧。如果我刚加入一个团队或公司，
[00:18:19.600] I try not to take PTO for at least the first six months or so, because I feel like there's two big reasons. One is like, this is already pretty chill time and you're usually spending maybe the first couple of weeks to a month ramping up, learning your role, getting to meet the people around you, your stakeholders, your teammates. And that's like pretty valuable time, you know, learning and being
[00:18:19.600] 我尽量不在入职后的前六个月左右请假，因为我觉得有两个主要原因。首先，这段时间本来就比较轻松，你通常会花几周到一个月的时间来适应新工作，了解自己的角色，认识周围的人，包括你的利益相关者和团队成员。这段时间非常宝贵，可以用来学习和成长。
[00:18:46.580] at the company. And then after that, you're, you're just like getting into the flow and I think kind of building a routine almost. So I think it's like a pretty good time to just stay there and it's not like too stressful. Hopefully you're building up your relationships. So I feel like it's a pretty important time to stay. And I think it also, well, I don't know, this is just me, but I feel like the
[00:18:46.580] 在公司里，之后你就会慢慢进入状态，逐渐建立起一套固定的工作流程。所以我觉得这是个不错的时机，可以待在那里，压力也不会太大。希望你也能借此机会建立起人际关系。所以我觉得这是个很重要的时期。而且，嗯，我不知道，这只是我个人的看法，但我感觉……
[00:19:11.340] perception is that maybe it looks bad if you join an immediate, you're like, oh, I planned this vacation to take in like three weeks. Bye guys. Unless of course it was like a previously planned, like, I'm so sorry, everyone like already had this plan. I think that's a little different. It's definitely one of those things where I feel like I would also maybe like slightly judge someone if they joined and then suddenly was jet setting across the world, taking like multiple weeks off.
[00:19:11.340] 人们普遍认为，如果你加入一个团队后立刻就离开，可能会显得不太好，比如你会说：“哦，我计划三周后就去度假了。拜拜各位。” 当然，除非是之前就计划好的，比如“非常抱歉，大家都有这个计划了”。我觉得这种情况就有点不一样了。如果有人加入团队后突然就飞来飞去，休假好几个星期，我可能也会有点在意他。
[00:19:40.160] It's like one of those things where you wish you could be like the chill person. But I think if you just don't know someone well enough, that's just kind of what happens. So then like you, I also try to be mindful of that. Towing the balance of min-maxing PTO for the first couple of months. Yeah. And I think it probably also really depends on your team because I'm sure there's definitely a lot of teams who might not care. They might be like, oh yeah, this is really good downtime to take some
[00:19:40.160] 就像那种你希望自己能成为那种随和的人的情况。但我觉得如果你对某人不够了解，这种情况就很容易发生。所以和你一样，我也尽量注意这一点。在前几个月里，我会努力平衡如何最大化利用带薪休假。是的。而且我觉得这可能也取决于你的团队，因为我确信肯定有很多团队可能并不在意。他们可能会觉得，哦，是的，这是个很好的休息时间，可以好好放松一下。
[00:20:06.020] vacation. So go ahead if you want to. But I feel like definitely just kind of like feel out the vibes. Yeah. And also you probably just don't have many hours to spend anyway. Oh, that's so true. Yeah. Of course the case is very different if you have unlimited PTO, but I just don't have experience in that field. Yeah. Question for you. Have you ever experienced the opposite where you suddenly realize like, damn, I'm like not taking enough PTO? Not yet.
[00:20:06.020] 休假。所以想休假就休假吧。但我感觉最好还是先感受一下氛围。是啊。而且你可能本来也没多少时间。哦，说得太对了。是啊。当然，如果你有无限带薪休假，情况就完全不同了，但我在这方面没什么经验。是啊。问你个问题。你有没有过相反的经历，突然意识到，哎呀，我的带薪休假不够？还没有。
[00:20:37.060] For some reason, I've been like making international trips towards the end of the year for the past three years or so. Usually when I do those bigger international trips, I take about two weeks of PTO. And so, so far I've not like hit the ceiling where they're like, oh, your PTO days are capped. Like you need to take some time off. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.
[00:20:37.060] 不知为何，过去三年左右，我总是在年底安排国际旅行。通常，每次出差，我都会请两周左右的年假。所以，到目前为止，我还没遇到过年假天数用完的情况，也没遇到过需要休假的情况。我不知道这到底是好事还是坏事。
[00:21:01.680] Yeah. I feel like recently I've been taking a ton of PTO, but I will say COVID years, my workload was super heavy and also people weren't really traveling at that time, right? Just health wise. So I remember those years, there were definitely some moments where I was like, oh my God, even if I don't go anywhere, I need to take a day off. This is too much work. I'm working late hours. Sometimes I was even working on like weekends.
[00:21:01.680] 是啊。感觉最近我请了很多年假，但疫情那几年，我的工作量超级大，而且那时候大家都不怎么出差旅行，对吧？主要是出于健康考虑。所以我记得那几年，确实有好几次我都觉得，天哪，就算哪儿也不去，我也得休息一天。工作量太大了。我经常加班到很晚。有时候甚至周末都要工作。
[00:21:28.400] Oh my God. So yeah, I feel like there are moments in life where you just look up and you're like, I have a lot of PTO in the bank. Like I should spend it. And that's something that I've had to come to terms with too. Sometimes I have like a hoarder's mentality with like PTO where I'm like, oh my precious PTO, like I need to save this for whatever international trip. But I realized like sometimes if you really need a day, it's worth taking it even if you don't really do anything or go
[00:21:28.400] 我的天哪。是啊，我觉得人生中总有那么几个时刻，你会突然意识到，我的年假账户里还存着好多年假呢。我应该把它们都用掉。这也是我不得不接受的。有时候，我对年假就像个囤积狂，会想，哦，我宝贵的年假，我得留着它们去出国旅行。但我后来意识到，有时候如果你真的需要休息一天，即使什么都不做，也值得休息。
[00:21:55.620] anywhere. I'm also definitely hoarder mentality for my PTO. I mean, I've said that I take like vacation and I'll take PTO for that. But literally if I cannot take PTO, I will not take it. Like for example, the domestic traveling, I'm like, why would I take PTO for this? I should just save, you know? So I totally get that. And you're so right in the regular day to day. I don't really think,
[00:21:55.620] 任何地方。而且我绝对有囤积休假的习惯。我的意思是，我说过我会休假，也会为此请休假。但如果不能请休假，我就不会请。比如国内旅行，我就想，我为什么要请休假？我应该把休假存起来，你知道吗？所以我完全理解。你说的对，在日常生活中，我真的觉得，
[00:22:19.180] oh, maybe I'm super burnt out. I should just take a Friday off or something. But when you like step back and look at the big picture, it's kind of like, oh, maybe that would help. And it's like always interesting because I think when you're really, really busy at work, there's obviously so much work that needs to get done. Even just workload wise, like the last thing I'm thinking is, oh, I should take some time off because then you have less hours to put towards
[00:22:19.180] 哦，也许我真的筋疲力尽了。我应该周五休息一天什么的。但当你冷静下来，从长远角度来看，你会觉得，哦，也许那样会有帮助。这总是很有意思，因为我觉得当你工作非常非常忙的时候，显然有很多工作要做。即使只是从工作量来看，我最不会想到的就是，哦，我应该休息一下，因为那样我就少花点时间在工作上了。
[00:22:47.480] that project or whatever you're trying to accomplish before the deadline. I always find it to be sort of like a catch 22. I know this day off will really help, but that's also eight less hours that I could put towards like finishing something. Yeah. I don't know what the right answer is for that. You know, what I've seen is people just save their PTO and then they get an email that says like,
[00:22:47.480] 那个项目或者任何你想在截止日期前完成的事情。我总是觉得这有点像个两难困境。我知道休息一天真的很有帮助，但这也意味着我少了八个小时可以用来完成一些事情。是啊，我不知道正确的答案是什么。你知道，我见过有些人攒着休假，然后收到一封邮件，说：
[00:23:12.540] hey, your PTO is like full, so you need to take a day off before your next paycheck. And so they're like, okay, I guess I'm forced to take a rest day, a day off. And then they're like, that was kind of nice. So that's what I've seen. Maybe you don't have to actively think about it and you just wait for that email to come. I think this year I have the opposite problem. I've been like running my PTO
[00:23:12.540] 嘿，你的带薪休假用完了，所以你需要在下次发工资前休息一天。然后他们就会想，好吧，看来我得被迫休息一天了。然后他们又会觉得，这还挺好的。这就是我看到的情况。也许你不用主动去想，只要等着邮件就行了。我觉得今年我的情况正好相反。我一直在忙着用我的带薪休假。
[00:23:38.940] balance down to zero. So it's crazy out here. You know, there's always that period of time. I think it's like July to August where you're like, oh, August has no long weekends. And then you start to think about like, when is the next long weekend coming? After the beginning of September into October, that's also like a little low of like no long weekends. And I think those are the times where
[00:23:38.940] 余额降到了零。所以现在的情况很疯狂。你知道，总会有那么一段时间。我觉得大概是七八月份，你会觉得，哦，八月没有长周末。然后你就会开始想，下一个长周末是什么时候？九月初到十月份，也是长周末比较少的时期。我觉得就是在这段时间……
[00:24:06.300] I do seriously consider a little bit, oh, there's no long weekends. Should I just make myself one? And then it depends on how busy you are and how in need of that PTO you feel. But you're right. If you're really busy, you're kind of like, there's no time to take PTO right now. But do you ever think of it like, oh, if you get through this busy hump, you can reward yourself with like a day off? I think I've definitely felt that way with closing a big project or something.
[00:24:06.300] 我确实会认真考虑一下，哎呀，没有长周末。要不我给自己放个假？然后就取决于你有多忙，以及你有多需要休假。你说得对。如果你真的很忙，你就会觉得，现在根本没时间休假。但你有没有想过，哎呀，如果你熬过了这段忙碌期，就可以奖励自己一天假期？我觉得我完成一个大项目的时候肯定有过这种感觉。
[00:24:34.480] But I also think it very much depends on your field of work. There are certain fields of work where there's no chill season. It's like a lot of recurring tasks, a lot of things that need to be done. I think especially if anyone has worked in like supply chain or operations, the grind doesn't really stop. So then in that field, I don't know if I like really felt like there was that much of a chill time. Or if there was a chill time, it would be for like a week of the month. And then it would
[00:24:34.480] 但我认为这很大程度上取决于你的工作领域。有些领域根本没有淡季。比如有很多重复性的工作，很多事情需要完成。我觉得特别是如果你在供应链或运营领域工作过，就会发现这种高强度的工作几乎没有停歇期。所以，在这些领域，我感觉不到真的有那么长的休息时间。或者说，即使有休息时间，也只是一个月里大概一周左右。然后就又会是下一周了。
[00:25:02.500] like go back into that grind. But I think I know what you mean about when there's not a ton of true like holiday baked in, I start to really crave PTO. Yeah. And that's actually the privilege that we have as people who aren't parents yet of, oh, I can just like take a day off on like a random weekend in October. Like I don't have to adhere to like Labor Day weekend, Memorial Day weekend, where all
[00:25:02.500] 就像又回到那种忙碌的工作状态一样。但我明白你的意思，当没有太多真正的假期时，我就会特别渴望休假。是啊。这其实是我们这些还没当父母的人的特权，比如，我可以随便在十月的某个周末请一天假。我不用非得赶上劳动节周末、阵亡将士纪念日周末，那些周末……
[00:25:27.700] the vacation spots are so crowded already. We can kind of choose a chill weekend to go and travel somewhere. Oh, that's so true. I think one of my coworkers who has a daughter, she is taking next week off because they're going to go to Disneyland. And I was like, oh my god, it might be. Well, actually, I think right now it's okay-ish. But I was like, a couple weeks from now, it could be like busy spring break season, you know. But I think for them, it's like ski week maybe. So I'm like,
[00:25:27.700] 度假胜地已经人山人海了。我们可以选个轻松点的周末去旅行。哦，确实如此。我有个同事，她有个女儿，下周要请假，因为她们要去迪士尼乐园。我当时就想，我的天，那会儿可能人太多了。其实，我觉得现在还好。但我当时想，再过几周，可能就到了春假高峰期了，你知道的。不过我觉得对她们来说，那周可能是滑雪周。所以我就想，
[00:25:55.160] wait, it might also still be busy. Like they're just, you're right, they're forced to follow a certain schedule. Yeah. I'm like honestly counting down the years where we are still not parents and we can like do these things. I'm like, how many more Octobers can we actually travel? But I have a couple of funny questions for you logistically. Okay. So we talked a lot about like planning for
[00:25:55.160] 等等，可能还是会很忙。就像他们，你说得对，他们被迫遵守一定的时间表。是啊。说真的，我都在倒数着我们还没当父母、还能做这些事情的日子。我在想，我们还能有多少个十月可以真正去旅行呢？不过，我还有几个关于行程安排的有趣问题想问你。好的。我们之前聊了很多关于行程规划的事情。
[00:26:19.540] PTO, the appropriate number of days you can take off, that kind of stuff. But at the end of the day, when you take time off, you have to put it into the system. Right. And you have to put it into your calendar as well. So question number one, you are trying to take some time off and it's not yet set in stone, but you go to like block the days off on your calendar and you see that multiple people on
[00:26:19.540] 带薪休假，也就是你可以休假的天数等等。但归根结底，当你休假时，你必须把它录入系统。没错。你还得把它添加到你的日历里。所以第一个问题是，你想休假，但还没最终确定，当你准备在日历上标记休假日期时，你发现很多人……
[00:26:42.380] your team are taking that exact week off. What do you do? Okay. Well, it depends. Am I taking this PTO because I'm vacationing or just like for fun? You're thinking, oh, maybe I should just take a trip to Hawaii, like some random weekend. And you haven't booked anything yet, but you check the calendar. So if it's holiday season or like, I know it's kind of more like chill season, maybe it's right after a big event or something. Dude, the more people taking PTO, the better.
[00:26:42.380] 你的团队正好在那一周休假。你会怎么做？好吧。这要看情况。我休这个年假是为了度假还是只是为了玩乐？你可能在想，哦，也许我应该去夏威夷玩一趟，就随便找个周末。你还没订行程，但你查看了日历。所以，如果是节假日，或者，我知道现在更像是休闲季，也许是在某个大型活动之后。伙计，休假的人越多越好。
[00:27:12.480] But if it's busy season, then I'll think twice about it. I'll be like, oh shoot, these people are going to be preoccupied by whatever is happening in their personal lives. Maybe I'll move my trip out by like a week or something. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like for me too, if it's like last two weeks of December, I'm like, you know, everyone's going to be off, like no biggie. But if it's on like a random
[00:27:12.480] 但如果是旺季，那我就要好好考虑一下了。我会想，哎呀，这些人肯定会忙着处理自己的私事。也许我会把行程推迟一周左右。好吧。嗯。嗯。我觉得如果是十二月的最后两周，我也会想，大家都放假，没什么大不了的。但如果是像……这种随机的……
[00:27:37.940] week, I'd be like, okay, I probably can't take this time off. It's kind of like first come first serve to a certain extent, I think. Yeah. I guess it's like, you have to like survey the situation a little more if more people are taking PTO. But what's really funny is like last year, last two weeks of December, it just so happened that almost everyone on my team took PTO, whether it was for travel, for like family time. I don't really remember, but I was like, wow,
[00:27:37.940] 有时候，我会想，好吧，我可能没法请假了。我觉得这在某种程度上有点像先到先得。是啊。我想，如果休假的人多了，你就得稍微了解一下情况。但真正搞笑的是，去年12月的最后两周，我们团队几乎所有人都休假了，不管是去旅行还是陪家人。我记不太清了，但我当时就想，哇，真是不可思议。
[00:28:06.000] this year in particular, there's more people taking PTO. So I was like, okay, I'm just not going to take PTO because I wasn't traveling and it'll be chill anyway. If I took PTO, it would be a waste. So that's my hoarder mentality right there. I've definitely felt that way too. Yeah. It's going to be a chill week already. Like I can kind of catch up on old tasks, maybe work a little slower than usual. There's going to be less urgent stuff. So that in itself is already like very chill.
[00:28:06.000] 今年尤其如此，请年假的人更多了。所以我就想，好吧，我不打算请假了，因为我没出差，而且这周也很轻松。如果我请了假，那就浪费了。这就是我的囤积癖吧。我肯定也有过这种感觉。是啊。这周本来就会很轻松。我可以把之前的工作处理一下，也许可以比平时慢一点。不会有什么紧急的事情。所以光这一点就让人觉得很轻松了。
[00:28:33.820] Right. And you could spend that time. Like, I think I ended up spending that time prepping for the new year and like doing some of those trainings that I always forget to do. I actually maybe contrary to what the common vacation time is. Like I actually rarely ever take December PTO if I can help it. I feel that as well. Okay. Question number two, you are booking an international trip. Say it's like
[00:28:33.820] 对。你可以利用这段时间。比如，我觉得我最后把这段时间用来准备新年，以及参加一些我总是忘记做的培训。实际上，我的休假安排可能和一般的休假安排不太一样。如果可以的话，我很少在十二月休年假。我也有同感。好的。第二个问题，你正在预订一次国际旅行。假设是这样的：
[00:29:02.600] two weeks overseas or something, but you're booking it pretty far in advance. So say you're booking it like 12 months in advance. How early do you book that PTO into the system? Okay. So wait, this is actually kind of funny. I don't know why, but I don't love putting PTO into the official system too early. So what I've started to put into practice is I'll just book those
[00:29:02.600] 比如出国两周之类的，但你提前很久就预订了。假设你提前12个月预订。你会提前多久把休假申请录入系统呢？好的。等等，这其实有点搞笑。我也不知道为什么，但我不太喜欢太早把休假申请录入系统。所以我现在开始实践的做法是，我会提前预订这些假期。
[00:29:32.300] weeks out on my team calendar first. I'll just put in like crystal out of office and then I won't officially put it into the system until maybe like at most six months out. But I'll usually give my manager a heads up. Hey, I planned this vacation for this time. And she'll be like, okay. Okay. I think I'm very similar to you too. I will wait till it's like about the six month mark and then
[00:29:32.300] 我会在团队日历上提前几周就把假期安排好。我会先设置“Crystal 不在办公室”，然后最多提前六个月才会正式录入系统。但我通常会提前跟我的经理打个招呼：“嘿，我计划在这个时间休假。”她会说：“好的，好的。”我觉得我和你很像。我也会等到大概六个月的时候再正式录入系统。
[00:30:00.200] I'll put it into the system. I guess the only exception is if I know that period is like super, super busy, I'll probably give it a little bit more notice. Or if I know I'll truly be like unreachable during that time or something, I'll start to like pepper it into conversations. Like, oh my God, I'm so excited. Like I booked this vacation and just keep reminding people about it. So it's not like a surprise when I entered into the system, but I don't know why I feel so bad
[00:30:00.200] 我会把它录入系统。我想唯一的例外情况是，如果我知道那段时间会超级超级忙，我可能会提前多通知一下。或者如果我知道那段时间我真的联系不上，我就会开始在聊天中时不时地提起这件事。比如，“天哪，我太兴奋了！”就像我订了个假期一样，然后不停地提醒别人。这样，当我把行程录入系统的时候，大家就不会感到意外了，但我不知道为什么我还是会觉得很内疚。
[00:30:26.640] to book it really early. Yeah. I don't know either. Part of it though, I don't want to like use up my PTO. What if I have some random in between PTO that I want to use? And I'm like, oh shoot, I just like spent all that PTO on that two weeks. Oh, I see. Yeah. But now that I'm thinking about it, it doesn't even matter because if I spent it all, it's still accruing every couple of weeks. Right.
[00:30:26.640] 得很早就预订。是啊，我也不知道。不过，有一点，我不想把我的年假都用光。万一我还有一些零散的年假想用呢？然后我就想，糟了，我把所有年假都用在那两周了。哦，我明白了。是啊。不过现在想想，其实也没什么关系，因为就算用完了，它还是会每隔几周累积一次。对。
[00:30:51.740] So I guess that's actually not logically anything, but I don't know. It just feels like it. Yeah. It kind of feels like I'm like showing all my cards or something, you know, like I'm like burying all my PTO out there being PTO vulnerable. Oh my God. PTO vulnerable. Oh my God. Okay. I also, I have a problem because I feel so bad saying no to meetings.
[00:30:51.740] 所以我觉得这其实从逻辑上讲没什么意义，但我也不知道。就是感觉是这样。是啊。感觉就像我把所有底牌都亮出来了，你知道吗，就像我把所有的休假都暴露出来了，让自己很容易被动用休假。我的天哪。休假很容易被动用。我的天哪。好吧。另外，我还有一个问题，就是我很难过地拒绝参加会议。
[00:31:20.220] I always just say yes. And if I'm not sure, I just like don't respond. So you know how like the out of office thing, it automatically just says no to all your meetings. Yeah. Dude, I said it so that it does not. Oh, cause you're like, I don't want to say no to this meeting, even though I literally am not working. I'm like, I don't want to just announce to everyone that I'm
[00:31:20.220] 我总是直接答应。如果我不确定，我就不回复。你知道那种自动回复功能，它会自动拒绝所有会议。是啊。哥们，我特意设置了，这样它就不会自动拒绝了。哦，因为你肯定会想，我不想拒绝这个会议，即使我实际上没在工作。我就是不想让所有人知道我……
[00:31:45.860] out of office this day. Dude, I need to change that setting back though, because what it forces me to do though, is I have to go through those days and manually say no to every single meeting. And then this actually started because I think I took a random day off to attach to a long weekend.
[00:31:45.860] 今天不在办公室。老兄，我得把那个设置改回去，因为它迫使我手动拒绝所有会议。而这一切的起因，好像是我为了凑个长周末，随便请了一天假。
[00:32:08.300] And it was like automatically decline all calendar invites, new and old. And it scared me. So I said, no, but I think I do have it set to automatically decline new ones, but not old ones. So I have to manually decline the old ones. It feels bad. We're different people. I'm like, this feels great.
[00:32:08.300] 它好像会自动拒绝所有日历邀请，包括新的和旧的。这让我很害怕。所以我说，不，但我想我的确设置了自动拒绝新邀请，但不会自动拒绝旧的。所以我必须手动拒绝旧的邀请。感觉很糟糕。我们是不同的人。我心想，这感觉真好。
[00:32:32.850] Like I'm not attending any of these meetings. Oh my God. I think it's because I, a lot of my meetings are, it's the one team meeting of the week. I just don't have that many meetings. So every meeting feels like a, I should go. I'm obligated to go. Yeah. So it feels even worse to be like, no, I'm just going to skip this because I literally have nothing else on my calendar.
[00:32:32.850] 感觉就像我一个会议都没参加一样。天哪。我觉得是因为我，很多时候，一周就只有一个团队会议。我开的会真的不多。所以每次开会都感觉像是“我应该去”。“我有义务去”。是啊。所以，如果我说“不，我就不去了”，感觉就更糟糕了，因为我的日程表上真的没有其他安排了。
[00:33:01.510] Okay. I have two more rapid fire questions for you. When you book time off on your team calendar, do you put crystal OOO or do you put crystal PTO? Oh, crystal OOO. Oh, okay. I think it's like implied that we're taking PTO. Yeah. Yeah. I actually matched the vibes of my team. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm like, if this team does PTO, I'll do PTO. If this other team does OOO, I'll do OOO.
[00:33:01.510] 好的。我还有两个快问快答的问题。你们在团队日历上安排休假的时候，是写“水晶 OOO”还是“水晶 PTO”？哦，是“水晶 OOO”。哦，好的。我觉得这样就默认我们休的是 PTO 了。对，对。我其实是按照我们团队的习惯来安排的。哦，好的。好的。我的想法是，如果这个团队休 PTO，那我也休 PTO。如果另一个团队休 OOO，那我也休 OOO。
[00:33:28.370] You know what? That's a good point. I think everyone on my team just puts OOO. So if they all put PTO, I probably would be like, blend in. No need to stand out when you're taking PTO. Facts, honestly. Last question for you. How do you feel about people who say I'm going to be out of pocket? Oh my God. Okay. So this is a huge thing because I looked into it because I was like, this is like not
[00:33:28.370] 你知道吗？你说得对。我觉得我们团队里每个人都写“OOO”（下班时间）。所以如果他们都写“PTO”（带薪休假），我可能就会想，算了，随大流吧。休假的时候没必要特立独行。说真的，确实如此。最后一个问题。你对那些说“我要出差了”的人有什么看法？我的天哪。好吧。这很重要，因为我研究过这个问题，我觉得这不太好。
[00:33:58.210] what out of pocket means. Right. But I looked into it and I think what some people think it means is like their phone is out of their pocket. They're going to be on vacation. Like they're not bringing their work stuff. So they're going to be unreachable. And I was like, okay, I guess that does make sense. But like, why is it happening? Here's the craziest part. When I looked
[00:33:58.210] “不在口袋里”是什么意思？没错。但我研究了一下，我觉得有些人理解的意思是，比如手机不在口袋里。他们要去度假，没带工作用品，所以联系不上。我当时就想，好吧，这么说好像也有点道理。但问题是，为什么会这样呢？最离谱的是，当我查看……
[00:34:21.750] into it, it was like older people, millennials to boomers who are using this a lot. Because I think when Gen Z were using it, they were like just accidentally, legitimately accidentally using it. And I was like, okay, but then why is this coming back? Do you know what I mean? Like we've been using out of office for so long. Like why are we bringing back this out of pocket when it can be so confused with the other meaning?
[00:34:21.750] 我发现，现在用这个词的主要是年纪大一些的人，从千禧一代到婴儿潮一代。因为我觉得Z世代用这个词的时候，纯粹是无意中用到了，真的是无意中用到了。我就想，好吧，那为什么这个词又流行起来了呢？你明白我的意思吗？我们用“out of office”（不在办公室）这个词已经很久了。为什么现在又要用“out of pocket”（不在口袋里）这个词呢？它很容易和“out of office”的意思混淆。
[00:34:50.890] Yeah, dude. I feel like I have to clarify for the listeners because as soon as I brought up the phrase out of pocket or like, you know, people misusing out of pocket, Crystal started looking so angry. Like your entire demeanor changed. And I'm actually crying laughing. I didn't even realize.
[00:34:50.890] 是啊，兄弟。我觉得我得跟听众们解释一下，因为我一提到“out of pocket”这个短语，或者你知道的，人们滥用“out of pocket”的情况，Crystal 就开始一脸生气。你整个人都变了。我当时真的笑到飙泪了。我都没意识到。
[00:35:18.300] But it is very interesting. I remember once you texted me like, oh my god, I think these people are using out of pocket wrong to mean out of office. And I was like, what? Like, that's crazy. And after you texted me that I've been seeing it everywhere. And every time I see it, it just cracks me up. Yeah, because out of pocket for us, it means like, like unhinged comment or something. Yeah, right. Like very, like you said something really rude. When people are like, I'm going to
[00:35:18.300] 但这真的很有意思。我记得你之前给我发短信说，我的天哪，我觉得这些人把“out of pocket”用错了，用来表示“out of office”（不在办公室）。我当时就想，什么？这也太离谱了吧。你发短信告诉我之后，我发现到处都能看到这种用法。每次看到都让我笑个不停。是啊，因为对我们来说，“out of pocket”的意思是，比如，语无伦次的评论之类的。对，没错。就像你说了什么特别没礼貌的话。当人们说，我要……
[00:35:46.720] be out of pocket. You're like bracing yourself like, oh, okay, what is like the mean thing you're about to say? Yeah, yeah. Like drop the mic. But they're actually just going to Hawaii. Yeah. Also, OOO does not even mean out of pocket. OOO is out of office. Out of pocket is OOP.
[00:35:46.720] 出丑了。你就像在给自己打气，心想，哦，好吧，接下来要说的是什么刻薄话？是啊，是啊。就像要扔麦克风一样。但他们实际上只是要去夏威夷。是啊。还有，OOO 根本不是 out of pocket 的意思。OOO 是 out of office 的意思。out of pocket 是 OOP。
[00:36:12.140] So true. There's just so many things wrong. Just all the signs point to you're misusing this phrase. You're so like worked up. Yeah, it's because I just haven't found a satisfying answer. You know, I need to do more digging on this because this is like the best explanation that I could find. It's like, oh, okay, like your phone's out of your pocket. You know, I'm going to be unreachable. But I'm like,
[00:36:12.140] 确实如此。错的地方太多了。种种迹象表明你误用了这个短语。你好像很激动。是啊，因为我还没找到满意的答案。你知道，我需要再深入研究一下，因为这已经是目前我能找到的最好的解释了。就像，哦，好吧，就像你的手机从口袋里拿出来了。你知道，我可能联系不上。但我感觉，
[00:36:37.600] okay, really? Like, I feel like that's kind of awkward phrasing too. Like I'm going to be out of pocket versus like, I'm just not going to bring my work stuff. Yeah. And the only work thing that fits into your pocket is like your phone. Yeah. Your laptop doesn't fit in your pocket. Exactly. So you are not your laptop. Exactly. That's the thing, right? So I'm kind of like,
[00:36:37.600] 好吧，真的吗？我觉得这种说法也挺别扭的。感觉像是“我会把口袋弄空”而不是“我只是不带工作用品”。是啊。唯一能放进口袋的工作用品就是手机了。没错。笔记本电脑放不进口袋。就是啊。所以你不是你的笔记本电脑。没错。就是这样，对吧？所以我就想，
[00:37:00.980] this phrasing just doesn't feel right. I dare you to call out the next person you see on Slack saying I'm going to be out of pocket. Oh my God. I actually have not seen someone use that in like maybe a year. So that's good. The out of pocket pandemic is over. Yeah. Hopefully. Yeah. Like ever since I texted you that one time, I haven't really seen it since. Oh, okay. Maybe it
[00:37:00.980] 这种说法感觉不太对劲。我敢打赌，下次你在 Slack 上看到有人说“我要出去玩了”的时候，你肯定会说出来。我的天哪。我好像一年都没见过有人这么说了。这很好。“出去玩”的流行已经过去了。是啊。但愿如此。是啊。自从我上次给你发了那条信息之后，我就没再见过有人这么说了。哦，好吧。也许是吧。
[00:37:30.840] was just an auto correct or something. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I've been seeing it on my end. So you just passed the baton to me. Okay. But what if it's also like, it was an accident, but now it's just like people started using it ironically because they thought it was funny and now they can't stop using it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a meme. Yeah. Pretty much. I'll report back if I ever find,
[00:37:30.840] 只是自动纠错之类的。是啊。嗯，我也不知道。我这边也看到了。所以你把接力棒传给我了。好的。但如果也是这样呢？一开始是个意外，但现在人们觉得好笑，就开始讽刺地用它，然后就停不下来了。是啊。是啊。是啊。就像个梗一样。是啊。差不多。如果我找到什么线索，我会汇报的。
[00:37:57.080] if I ever uncover more truths about this out of pocket situation. It's an unsolved mystery. Yeah. I have a question for you. Yeah. So for PTO, do you leave all of your work stuff at home? So it depends. If I'm taking a vacation like overseas, I will not bring my laptop for the most part, but my phone has all of like my work stuff logged into it. So if I need to urgently
[00:37:57.080] 如果我以后能发现更多关于这笔自费支出的真相，那将是一个未解之谜。是的。我有个问题想问你。是的。那么，休假的时候，你会把所有工作的东西都留在家里吗？这要看情况。如果我去国外度假，我通常不会带笔记本电脑，但我的手机里存着所有工作资料。所以如果我有紧急需要……
[00:38:26.720] respond to an email or like a Slack message or something, I'll have it on hand. I'll usually turn off notifications to be honest, but you can select it so that it's like, oh, turn off notifications unless it's from my manager or something like that. So I'll usually toggle some sort of setting like that. But if I am going on vacation and it's local or like domestic, I will bring my laptop because then it's just like easy to bring it along with me. Yeah. That's fair. I think I would
[00:38:26.720] 回复邮件或者Slack消息之类的，我都会随身带着。老实说，我通常会关掉通知，不过你可以设置成“除非是我的经理发来的，否则不接收通知”之类的。所以我一般会调整一下这个设置。但如果我要去度假，而且是本地或者国内的，我会带上笔记本电脑，因为这样携带起来很方便。嗯，有道理。我想我会这么做。
[00:38:55.180] agree with that. I'm probably of similar pattern. I have another final question. How long does it take you to catch up on your inbox when you come back from PTO? Oh God, wait, I'm getting like anxiety just thinking about it, to be honest. Okay. Nevermind. You don't have to answer. Wait, I actually feel like the corporate setting or like your team setting is very important for this.
[00:38:55.180] 同意。我的情况可能也差不多。我还有一个问题。你休假回来后，通常要多久才能处理完收件箱里的邮件？哦，天哪，等等，说实话，光是想想就让我有点焦虑。好吧。算了。你不必回答。等等，我觉得公司环境或者团队环境对这个问题很重要。
[00:39:19.900] In my past lives, I feel like it would literally take me like a week and I would come back to like over a thousand emails just because of like the sheer nature of what my work was focused around. There's always like all these comms going on. I'm working with like 40 different teams, like external people are emailing me. So it will legitimately take me like a week. But I think in like a more chill or also
[00:39:19.900] 以前，我觉得处理这些邮件可能要花我整整一周的时间，回来之后就会发现有上千封，就因为我的工作性质。总是有各种各样的沟通在进行。我得跟大约40个不同的团队合作，还有外部人员给我发邮件。所以，真的要花我整整一周的时间。但我觉得，如果现在更轻松一些，或者……
[00:39:44.620] like a more specialized environment, like if you're on a team that handles a couple of things and not all these different things for like everyone, then I think it would probably take me like a day or two. I think for me, it's usually around a day. Also, I'm like not super high up. So I don't have a lot of people reaching out to me directly for really important stuff. They can always just reach out to my
[00:39:44.620] 比如在一个更专业化的环境中，像你所在的团队只负责几件事，而不是像其他人那样要处理各种各样的事情，那我觉得可能只需要一两天。对我来说，通常一天左右就能搞定。而且，我的职位不算很高，所以很少有人会直接找我谈重要的事情。他们总是可以联系我的部门。
[00:40:10.000] manager. I think when I feel the worst though, is when I'm in a long thread and I'm on PTO and every time they send an email, they get my auto response. I'm like, I'm so sorry guys. But yeah, I feel like those long threads are the biggest thing, right? Because you have to like read through everything that you missed. Yeah, yeah. Or I have trauma from like coming back on vacation to all these emails
[00:40:10.000] 经理。我觉得最糟糕的时候，就是我休假的时候，被卷进一个很长的邮件讨论串里，每次他们发邮件，都只能收到我的自动回复。我就想，真抱歉啊各位。是啊，我觉得那些长长的邮件讨论串才是最烦人的，对吧？因为你得把所有错过的邮件都看完。是啊，是啊。或者，我休假回来看到这么多邮件，也会有心理阴影。
[00:40:39.900] and you open each email and it says like, oh, Jisoo's on PTO till Monday, but she's back on Tuesday. I'll have her look at this ASAP when she's back. And there's like 40 of those. And I'm like, holy fuck, how am I supposed to catch up on all of this? Oh my god. Yeah, that's intense. Yeah. Or the other one is like, if you're on a smaller team or maybe there's like less structure in the company that
[00:40:39.900] 你打开每封邮件，上面写着，哦，Jisoo休假到周一，周二就回来了。她回来后我会尽快让她看看。这样的邮件大概有40封。我就想，我的天，我怎么可能全部看完？我的老天。是啊，太疯狂了。是啊。还有一种情况是，如果你在一个小团队里，或者公司结构比较松散，
[00:41:05.820] you're working at, your team might not have like a distribution email, you know? So like if people are personally emailing you for stuff, but no other people are CC'd. So it's just like sitting there for the two weeks that you're out. I feel like that feels really bad. But as long as you know, your other people are getting CC'd, usually someone will take care of it. Yeah. But sometimes people might not know who else to reach out to. So it's just they're left unanswered for multiple weeks. Yeah, that's so true. That's probably the worst part about coming back from PTO.
[00:41:05.820] 你所在的团队可能没有统一的邮件群发邮箱，你知道吗？所以如果有人私下给你发邮件，但没有抄送其他人。这样一来，在你休假的两周里，邮件就只能静静地躺在那里。我觉得这感觉真的很糟糕。但只要你知道其他人都被抄送了，通常就会有人处理。是啊。但有时候，人们可能不知道该联系谁。所以，邮件就只能好几个星期无人回复。没错，确实如此。这大概是休假回来后最糟糕的部分了。
[00:41:36.340] Catching up on the inbox. Yeah. Wait, I'm like about to break out into a cold sweat. Oh no. Okay, we'll stop talking about it. But it's always fun to come back and chat with your team members about all the fun things you did. True. Wait, my favorite thing is when people come back from vacation and then they like show you photos. I'm like, this is so cute. It's like IRL Instagram. Yeah. So what I've started to well, one time when I went on vacation, my team was like, take pictures,
[00:41:36.340] 正在处理收件箱里的事情。嗯。等等，我感觉自己快要冒冷汗了。哦不。好吧，我们别再聊这个了。不过，回来和团队成员聊聊度假的趣事总是很有意思的。没错。等等，我最喜欢的就是大家度假回来后给我看照片。我就觉得，这也太可爱了吧。简直就像现实版的Instagram。是啊。所以，我开始……嗯，有一次我去度假，我的团队就说，拍照，
[00:42:05.880] take pictures. And you know me, I usually don't really take that many pictures, especially if I'm traveling like alone or maybe with like small groups. So that time I was traveling alone and I was like, they said it so much, like take pictures, take pictures. I was like, I owe it to them. They don't really know me that well. I should really show them more about my like, you know, random adventures. And there's no harm in sharing pictures about my personal travels. So at that time, I made a very
[00:42:05.880] 拍照。你知道我，我通常不太爱拍照，尤其是一个人旅行或者跟几个小伙伴一起旅行的时候。那次我一个人旅行，他们老是说拍照，拍照，我就想，我应该给他们看看。他们其实不太了解我，我应该让他们多看看我的那些奇遇。分享一些旅行照片也没什么坏处。所以当时，我拍了很多照片。
[00:42:35.480] intentional effort to take photos. After the trip, I even made a little presentation. Well, it was just like photos slapped on with some captions. Yeah. But I was like, here you go. You can all look at my pictures since you all requested it. So now I'm like, it's kind of nice to share that. It's a good bonding topic too. So I try to take at least a couple photos that are acceptable to show to my team
[00:42:35.480] 我特意拍了一些照片。旅行结束后，我还做了个小小的展示。其实就是把照片随便贴上去，配上一些文字说明。没错。但我当时想，给你们看看吧，既然你们都想看，那就看看我的照片吧。所以现在我觉得，分享这些照片挺好的。这也是个不错的增进感情的话题。所以我尽量每次都拍几张可以给团队看的照片。
[00:43:04.100] nowadays. That is very cute. I feel so shy like sharing photos, but I do. I will try to take like one or two key stories. So when people are like, how's your vacation? I could be like, oh my God, you'll never believe what happened. Blah, blah, blah. And it's just like a talking point. Auditory evidence that I actually vacationed. Yeah. They're like, did this person actually vacation? They always
[00:43:04.100] 现在这样挺可爱的。我其实不太好意思分享照片，但我还是会分享。我会尽量拍一两张关键照片，这样当别人问我“你的假期怎么样？”的时候，我就可以说“我的天哪，你绝对想不到发生了什么！”等等等等。这就成了个谈资，也成了我确实度假的“证据”。是啊，他们会想，这个人真的度假了吗？他们总是
[00:43:28.340] take PTO, but they never share. That's like me. Same. I'm like, guys, I'm actually traveling. Please believe me. Well, aside from the brief moment of nausea where I was like, oh my God, how am I going to catch up on my hypothetical inbox? This has been very interesting to talk about our personal PTO rules. And it also makes me very excited for all the upcoming PTO that you and I both have
[00:43:28.340] 休假，但从来不跟别人分享。这跟我一样。没错。我就像在说，拜托，我真的在旅行。请相信我。好吧，除了那短暂的恶心感——当时我想，天哪，我该怎么处理那些假设中的邮件呢？——之外。聊聊我们各自的休假规则真的很有意思。这也让我对你我即将到来的休假感到非常兴奋。
