[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crest podcast.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到 Eat Your Crest 播客。
[00:00:02.100] I'm Crystal.
[00:00:02.100] 我是克丽丝塔尔。
[00:00:02.859] I'm Gisoo.
[00:00:02.859] 我是Gisoo。
[00:00:03.740] And I'm Brian.
[00:00:03.740] 我是布莱恩。
[00:00:15.500] So welcome back, Brian.
[00:00:15.500] 欢迎回来，布莱恩。
[00:00:17.219] The last time we had Brian on was actually like five years ago.
[00:00:17.219] 上次我们请布莱恩来做客其实已经是五年前的事了。
[00:00:22.500] It was way back episode 33, socially awkward.
[00:00:22.500] 那是在第33集，社交尴尬的时候。
[00:00:27.679] He's an OG guest.
[00:00:27.679] 他是元老级嘉宾。
[00:00:28.839] Yes, that is me.
[00:00:28.839] 是的，那就是我。
[00:00:29.760] Good to be back.
[00:00:29.760] 很高兴回来。
[00:00:32.200] Well, to be fair, Brian was living in Seattle
[00:00:32.200] 公平地说，布莱恩当时住在西雅图。
[00:00:34.920] for a really long time after college.
[00:00:34.920] 大学毕业后很长一段时间都是如此。
[00:00:36.920] And so now he just moved back to the bay, which is nice.
[00:00:36.920] 所以现在他搬回了海湾地区，这挺好的。
[00:00:40.600] We literally just saw him like two times in this last week,
[00:00:40.600] 过去一周我们只见过他两次，
[00:00:43.640] which isn't a pre-life.
[00:00:43.640] 这不是前世。
[00:00:44.799] Wait, why do you saylapse. It is more.
[00:00:44.799] 等等，你为什么说“失效”？它不止于此。
[00:00:47.539] It's an improvement.
[00:00:47.539] 这是一个进步。
[00:00:48.640] I feel like before I was like maybe once every two years.
[00:00:48.640] 我感觉以前我大概两年一次吧。
[00:00:52.640] That's true.
[00:00:52.640] 这是真的。
[00:00:53.640] Yeah.
[00:00:53.640] 是的。
[00:00:54.640] Wait, once every two years, I don't know about that.
[00:00:54.640] 等等，两年一次？我不太清楚。
[00:00:56.640] I was like COVID era though.
[00:00:56.640] 我当时正处于新冠疫情时代。
[00:00:57.880] Oh yeah.
[00:00:57.880] 哦，是的。
[00:00:58.880] Yeah.
[00:00:58.880] 是的。
[00:00:59.880] So we're excited to have Brian back on and we have a Gen Z slang word to share today.
[00:00:59.880] 我们很高兴布莱恩再次做客，今天我们要分享一个Z世代俚语。
[00:01:06.319] The word itself is clears in like a phrase form. It's that clears or like you know this
[00:01:06.319] 这个词本身就像一个短语，清晰明了。它就像是“清晰”或“你知道的”那样。
[00:01:13.099] clears and the way I've seen it used is basically confirming that something is really good.
[00:01:13.099] 清晰明了，而且我看到它的用法基本上是在确认某件事真的很好。
[00:01:18.900] So the way that I kind of think about it in my head is like oh that clears the bar.
[00:01:18.900] 所以我脑子里想的大概就是，哦，这下过关了。
[00:01:23.780] When I looked it up it also means if you're comparing
[00:01:23.780] 我查了一下，它也意味着如果你在进行比较的话。
[00:01:26.799] two things, then like one thing clears the other. Yeah. I guess it's kind of like mogging.
[00:01:26.799] 两件事，然后一件事情就解决了另一件。是啊。我觉得这有点像拖延时间。
[00:01:33.120] What is that? The silence. I've never heard that word in my life.
[00:01:33.120] 那是什么？是寂静。我这辈子都没听过这个词。
[00:01:40.239] So to me, I see mogging as kind of like an extension of mewing, which we talked about last time.
[00:01:40.239] 所以在我看来，mogging 有点像是 mewing 的延伸，我们上次讨论过 mewing。
[00:01:45.640] But mogging is basically like when you see a photo of two people and one person looks really good in the picture and another person doesn't,
[00:01:45.640] 但“比拼颜面”基本上就好比你看到一张两个人的照片，其中一个人在照片里看起来很漂亮，而另一个人则不好看。
[00:01:51.879] then the person who looks good is mogging the other person.
[00:01:51.879] 那么，外表出众的人就胜过对方了。
[00:01:54.719] So they clear the ass of it, clear the other person.
[00:01:54.719] 所以他们撇清关系，也撇清对方的关系。
[00:01:59.200] Okay, I only know of mogging because Jisoo told me this word, but like I've still never seen it out in the wild.
[00:01:59.200] 好吧，我只知道 mogging 这个词是因为 Jisoo 告诉我的，但我从来没在现实生活中见过它。
[00:02:04.640] Oh my god. And it's crazy but I've still never seen it on the wild. Oh my God.
[00:02:04.640] 我的天哪。真是不可思议，我竟然从未在野外见过它。我的天哪。
[00:02:05.719] And it's crazy because I've also never seen clearing.
[00:02:05.719] 更不可思议的是，我也从未见过这种情况。
[00:02:08.680] It's like we're in different Gen Z pockets.
[00:02:08.680] 感觉我们就像身处不同的Z世代群体中。
[00:02:10.520] Maybe, maybe.
[00:02:10.520] 也许吧，也许吧。
[00:02:11.520] But Brian, have you seen either of these?
[00:02:11.520] 但是布莱恩，你见过这两个吗？
[00:02:13.280] I've seen clearing a lot.
[00:02:13.280] 我见过很多清理工作。
[00:02:14.520] I feel like people use it a lot in sports,
[00:02:14.520] 我觉得人们在体育运动中经常使用它。
[00:02:17.319] to be honest when they're comparing people,
[00:02:17.319] 说实话，当他们比较人的时候，
[00:02:19.080] but Mogging just made that.
[00:02:19.080] 但 Mogging 就做到了这一点。
[00:02:21.919] Wait, it's a real word.
[00:02:21.919] 等等，这居然是个真词。
[00:02:23.719] Where did you see it?
[00:02:23.719] 你在哪里看到的？
[00:02:24.560] On TikTok.
[00:02:24.560] 在TikTok上。
[00:02:25.719] Yeah.
[00:02:25.719] 是的。
[00:02:26.960] We're the true Gen Z slang star.
[00:02:26.960] 我们才是真正的Z世代俚语之星。
[00:02:28.719] Actually, though.
[00:02:28.719] 但实际上。
[00:02:30.639] Well, I'll have to do some more scrolling then,
[00:02:30.639] 那我得再往下滚动看看了。
[00:02:32.599] because I've yet to see mogging.
[00:02:32.599] 因为我还没见过碾压式碾压。
[00:02:34.199] But I think clears is pretty funny,
[00:02:34.199] 但我认为 clears 挺搞笑的，
[00:02:35.800] because I've also seen it.
[00:02:35.800] 因为我也看到了。
[00:02:37.319] I think Brian's right.
[00:02:37.319] 我认为布莱恩说得对。
[00:02:38.159] A lot of it is maybe sports-related,
[00:02:38.159] 其中很多可能都与体育有关。
[00:02:40.439] but I have also seen it where maybe someone is like,
[00:02:40.439] 但我也见过这种情况，比如有人可能会这样说：
[00:02:43.039] oh, hot take, but blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:43.039] 哦，这是个大胆的观点，但是，等等等等。
[00:02:45.360] And then sometimes people will say like, that clears.
[00:02:45.360] 然后有时人们会说，这就清楚了。
[00:02:47.800] Like that's okay and that's acceptable kind of.
[00:02:47.800] 感觉这样是可以接受的，某种程度上来说是可以的。
[00:02:50.280] Which I feel like is pretty funny
[00:02:50.280] 我觉得这挺搞笑的。
[00:02:51.800] because it's just like a long list of comments.
[00:02:51.800] 因为它就像一长串评论。
[00:02:53.960] Like that clears that.
[00:02:53.960] 这样就清楚了。
[00:02:55.159] Like, wait, actually I agree.
[00:02:55.159] 等等，其实我同意。
[00:02:57.159] It's kind of like valid.
[00:02:57.159] 这有点像是有效的。
[00:02:58.560] I feel like valid people would also do
[00:02:58.560] 我觉得有良知的人也会这样做。
[00:03:00.639] that valid comment chain.
[00:03:00.639] 有效的评论链。
[00:03:01.960] Yeah.
[00:03:01.960] 是的。
[00:03:02.800] Okay, this is kind of stupid maybe,
[00:03:02.800] 好吧，这或许有点蠢。
[00:03:04.800] but every time I read that clears,
[00:03:04.800] 但每次我读到这句话，它就变得清晰了。
[00:03:06.520] I just imagine someone doing pole vaulting.
[00:03:06.520] 我脑海中浮现出有人在做撑杆跳的画面。
[00:03:09.840] Like, why you said clear the bar?
[00:03:09.840] 你为什么说要清空吧台？
[00:03:15.759] You meant like a literal physical bar?
[00:03:15.759] 你是说像实体酒吧那样的酒吧吗？
[00:03:19.080] I think when I was first trying to understand it,
[00:03:19.080] 我觉得我最初试图理解它的时候，
[00:03:21.439] I was like, hmm, is this like limbo or polo-tick? I kind of get that,
[00:03:21.439] 我当时就想，嗯，这有点像玩过山车游戏还是马球游戏？我有点明白了。
[00:03:26.800] but polo-tick and action. Yeah, I can see it. Well, Gen Z were to side. Let's kind of jump into our
[00:03:26.800] 但马球和行动。是的，我能理解。好吧，Z世代站在一边。让我们直接进入正题。
[00:03:31.919] topic today. So today we wanted to do an episode about outbursts. I feel like this is a constant
[00:03:31.919] 今天的话题是情绪爆发。所以今天我们想做一期关于情绪爆发的节目。我觉得这似乎是一个永恒的主题。
[00:03:40.080] joke slash inspiration for me and Crystal because there was this one time we were traveling
[00:03:40.080] 这对我来说既是个玩笑，也是个灵感来源，因为有一次我们旅行的时候……
[00:03:45.560] with James and Aabi, our friend, in Spain and Portugal.
[00:03:45.560] 和詹姆斯以及我们的朋友艾比在西班牙和葡萄牙。
[00:03:49.319] I think anyone who's been on a long vacation with friends kind of understands what happens.
[00:03:49.319] 我想，凡是和朋友们一起度过漫长假期的人，大概都能理解会发生什么。
[00:03:53.960] It's very natural for things to kind of pile up during the vacation, nothing heavy, but
[00:03:53.960] 度假期间东西堆积起来是很自然的，虽然都不是什么重物，但是……
[00:03:58.560] just emotions kind of stir up like that.
[00:03:58.560] 情绪就是这样突然涌上心头的。
[00:04:00.680] And then someone will have like an outburst in the middle.
[00:04:00.680] 然后中间就会有人突然爆发。
[00:04:03.479] And I feel like it's always kind of funny, kind of cathartic, and it kind of makes everything a
[00:04:03.479] 我觉得这总是有点滑稽，有点宣泄作用，而且它让一切都变得……
[00:04:06.840] lot more light-hearted. So this episode goes out to James and Avi and it also
[00:04:06.840] 轻松愉快得多。所以这一集献给詹姆斯和艾维，也献给……
[00:04:11.039] goes out to our outbursts. Oh my god, the outburst that happened on that trip was
[00:04:11.039] 简直就是我们情绪爆发的代名词。我的天哪，那次旅行中发生的那次情绪爆发是……
[00:04:15.680] really funny. When I walk, I kind of swing my arms and it's like kind of a joke
[00:04:15.680] 真搞笑。我走路的时候会不自觉地摆动双臂，这有点像个玩笑。
[00:04:21.120] between us or it's like, oh, Chris, why do you swing your arms so much when you're
[00:04:21.120] 我们之间，或者就像，哦，克里斯，你为什么在……的时候总是挥舞手臂？
[00:04:24.600] walking? Because I swing my arms, it's easy for of a joke between us where it's like, oh, Crystal, why do you swing your arms so much when you're walking?
[00:04:24.600] 走路？因为我走路时会摆动双臂，所以我们之间很容易开个玩笑，比如，哦，克丽丝塔尔，你为什么走路时手臂摆动得那么厉害？
[00:04:25.480] Because I swing my arms, it's easy for me
[00:04:25.480] 因为我挥动双臂，所以对我来说很容易。
[00:04:27.800] to like accidentally hit someone else's hand.
[00:04:27.800] 比如不小心打到别人的手。
[00:04:30.639] And so it was like getting pretty late.
[00:04:30.639] 就这样，时间已经很晚了。
[00:04:32.279] Maybe it was like one of the last like three or four days.
[00:04:32.279] 也许是最近三四天里的某一天。
[00:04:35.079] Me and Avi's hand collided and I was like,
[00:04:35.079] 我和艾维的手碰在了一起，我当时就想，
[00:04:37.439] oh my God, our hands brushed.
[00:04:37.439] 我的天哪，我们的手碰到了。
[00:04:39.720] Avi was like, maybe if you stopped swinging your arms.
[00:04:39.720] Avi 说，也许如果你别再挥舞手臂就好了。
[00:04:42.319] So like Avi literally stopped walking turned around to face Chris on the middle of the street
[00:04:42.319] 所以，就像艾维突然停下脚步，转身面对站在街中央的克里斯一样。
[00:04:47.019] and like, yelled this.
[00:04:47.019] 然后，他大声喊出了这句话。
[00:04:48.180] I was like, oh my God, we've been vacationing for too long.
[00:04:48.180] 我当时就想，我的天哪，我们度假太久了。
[00:04:52.100] How deep into the trip was this?
[00:04:52.100] 这是旅程的哪个阶段？
[00:04:53.519] This was like the last leg, like the very last leg.
[00:04:53.519] 这就像是最后一程，真的是最后一程。
[00:04:55.839] Yeah.
[00:04:55.839] 是的。
[00:04:56.680] And like, the total trip was about two weeks.
[00:04:56.680] 整个行程大约持续了两周。
[00:04:58.180] So like, building up.
[00:04:58.180] 就像，逐步积累。
[00:04:59.420] Yeah, the rivers are flowering.
[00:04:59.420] 是的，河里都开花了。
[00:05:00.600] Yeah.
[00:05:00.600] 是的。
[00:05:01.660] It was so funny though.
[00:05:01.660] 真是太搞笑了。
[00:05:02.500] I think after you said that, we all just kind of paused and then burst out laughing. Yeah. It was so funny, though. I think after you said that, we all just kind of paused
[00:05:02.500] 我觉得你说完那句话之后，我们都愣了一下，然后就哈哈大笑起来。是啊，真的太搞笑了。我觉得你说完那句话之后，我们都愣了一下。
[00:05:05.379] and then burst out laughing.
[00:05:05.379] 然后突然大笑起来。
[00:05:08.339] And then now to this day, Avi and our group chat
[00:05:08.339] 直到今天，Avi 和我们的群聊依然存在。
[00:05:10.500] is named outburst.
[00:05:10.500] 被命名为爆发。
[00:05:13.459] To clarify everything, though, what
[00:05:13.459] 不过，为了澄清一切，什么
[00:05:15.500] do you define as an outburst?
[00:05:15.500] 你如何定义“爆发”？
[00:05:18.180] I feel like in retrospect, it's always
[00:05:18.180] 回想起来，我觉得总是
[00:05:20.420] a moment where you kind of lost your cool.
[00:05:20.420] 你有点失去冷静的那一刻。
[00:05:22.579] Like maybe just a little bit.
[00:05:22.579] 可能就一点点吧。
[00:05:24.220] For me, I always feel a little bit embarrassed
[00:05:24.220] 对我来说，我总是觉得有点尴尬。
[00:05:26.800] about it afterwards, but yeah, I feel like sometimes
[00:05:26.800] 事后想想，不过是的，我觉得有时候
[00:05:29.720] you have tension or like frustration building up
[00:05:29.720] 你感到紧张或沮丧情绪不断累积。
[00:05:31.959] and then you just kind of like let it out.
[00:05:31.959] 然后你就把它释放出来。
[00:05:35.160] I think that's a good description for it.
[00:05:35.160] 我觉得这个描述很贴切。
[00:05:38.680] I would also kind of describe it as a moment
[00:05:38.680] 我也会把它描述为一个瞬间
[00:05:41.360] where I show more emotion than what's appropriate probably
[00:05:41.360] 我可能在某个时候表现出的情绪比适当的要多。
[00:05:44.759] and I feel like it usually happens because I've been holding something back for a long time.
[00:05:44.759] 我觉得这种情况通常是因为我长期以来一直有所隐瞒。
[00:05:48.279] So there's definitely a bit of a build-up aspect to it.
[00:05:48.279] 所以这其中肯定存在一些铺垫的成分。
[00:05:51.519] Yeah, I agree. And also it's kind of like Brian said like a momentary explosion of emotion.
[00:05:51.519] 是的，我同意。而且就像布莱恩说的那样，就像是瞬间的情绪爆发。
[00:05:58.279] Or maybe like a quick snap, you snap at someone or something of that sort.
[00:05:58.279] 或者像打个响指那样，你对某人或某事发火。
[00:06:02.560] I think it's also funny maybe because everything
[00:06:02.560] 我觉得这也很搞笑，或许是因为一切
[00:06:06.639] leading up to it is usually very normal
[00:06:06.639] 在此之前通常都很正常
[00:06:09.480] and I'm just like, oh, suddenly.
[00:06:09.480] 我当时就想，哦，突然。
[00:06:11.600] It's like a lie-hearted,
[00:06:11.600] 这就像一颗谎言之心，
[00:06:13.040] you know, like there's been something like gnawing
[00:06:13.040] 你知道，就像一直有什么东西在啃噬着我。
[00:06:15.279] that you probably want to just like,
[00:06:15.279] 你可能只是想点赞，
[00:06:17.120] you guys usually like in the moment,
[00:06:17.120] 你们通常都喜欢活在当下，
[00:06:21.519] way, whether or not to do it or,
[00:06:21.519] 方式，或者是否去做，
[00:06:23.920] is it just kind of, it just happens. That's do it or is it just kind of it just happens?
[00:06:23.920] 是不是就这么发生了？是刻意为之，还是就这么发生了？
[00:06:25.759] That's a really good question. I feel like it just happens. Like you don't think and then after it
[00:06:25.759] 这真是个好问题。我觉得它就这么发生了。就像你没想那么多，然后……
[00:06:29.600] happens you're like oh wait I didn't have to do that. Wait I actually feel like I sort of wait.
[00:06:29.600] 有时你会想，哦等等，我其实不必那样做。等等，我感觉我好像一直在等待。
[00:06:35.439] Oh really? And I try to like validate myself. I'm like is this crazy or is this normal? And then
[00:06:35.439] 真的吗？然后我就试着去验证自己。我会想，这到底是疯了还是正常？
[00:06:39.839] I'm usually like this is normal and then I do it and I was like wait that was crazy.
[00:06:39.839] 我通常觉得这很正常，然后我做了之后就觉得，等等，这太疯狂了。
[00:06:41.720] I'm usually like, this is normal. And then I do it and I was like, wait, that was crazy.
[00:06:41.720] 我通常会觉得，这很正常。然后我做了之后，就会想，等等，这太疯狂了。
[00:06:43.879] No.
[00:06:43.879] 不。
[00:06:44.879] No.
[00:06:44.879] 不。
[00:06:45.879] Lared on night when you're trying to sleep, you're like staring at the ceiling.
[00:06:45.879] 晚上想睡觉的时候，你就像盯着天花板一样。
[00:06:48.519] Yeah.
[00:06:48.519] 是的。
[00:06:49.519] Maybe I shouldn't.
[00:06:49.519] 或许我不应该这么做。
[00:06:50.519] Like why did I do that?
[00:06:50.519] 我当时为什么要那样做？
[00:06:52.199] I wonder if Avi ever stays up and thinks about that.
[00:06:52.199] 我想知道艾维会不会熬夜思考这个问题。
[00:06:55.879] No.
[00:06:55.879] 不。
[00:06:56.879] He's like, I'm called out first now forever.
[00:06:56.879] 他就像在说，以后永远都是第一个被点名批评的人了。
[00:07:00.639] I feel like when traveling is definitely like the most common time.
[00:07:00.639] 我觉得旅行的时候肯定是最常见的情况。
[00:07:03.360] Oh my god, for sure.
[00:07:03.360] 我的天哪，绝对是。
[00:07:04.360] That would have happened with your friends.
[00:07:04.360] 这种情况也会发生在你的朋友身上。
[00:07:05.000] That's true. I also feel like it probably happens a little bit more with people you're more comfortable with.
[00:07:05.000] 没错。我也觉得这种情况在和比较熟悉的人相处时更容易发生。
[00:07:10.000] I feel like when I'm around family, I'm like more prone to help person.
[00:07:10.000] 我觉得和家人在一起的时候，我更容易表现出乐于助人的态度。
[00:07:14.000] Yeah. Because I'm like, let's fucking go. Let's do it it out.
[00:07:14.000] 是啊。因为我当时就想，咱们他妈的走吧。咱们干一票到底。
[00:07:17.000] True, true.
[00:07:17.000] 没错，没错。
[00:07:21.000] Do you think there's anything specific that triggers you?
[00:07:21.000] 你觉得有什么特定的事情会触发你的情绪吗？
[00:07:24.000] So I have something specific that does trigger me,
[00:07:24.000] 所以，我有一些特定的触发因素。
[00:07:28.279] but I feel like it's gonna make me sound so petty.
[00:07:28.279] 但我感觉这样会显得我很小气。
[00:07:30.879] So it just apologies to everyone in advance.
[00:07:30.879] 所以，我先提前向大家道歉。
[00:07:33.879] But I feel like something that really causes
[00:07:33.879] 但我感觉有些事情真的会造成
[00:07:36.480] an outburst for me is if before that,
[00:07:36.480] 对我来说，爆发是指在此之前，
[00:07:38.939] I'm like doing stuff that I feel like
[00:07:38.939] 我喜欢做自己想做的事情
[00:07:40.459] is kind of a sacrifice or like,
[00:07:40.459] 这是一种牺牲，或者说，类似……
[00:07:42.160] oh, I'll be the bigger person and like,
[00:07:42.160] 哦，我会表现得宽容大度一些，然后……
[00:07:44.240] do this or whatever. And I'm kind of a sacrifice or like, oh, I'll be the bigger person and like, do this or whatever.
[00:07:44.240] 做这个或者别的什么。我有点像个牺牲品，或者说，哦，我会表现得宽容大度，做这个或者别的什么。
[00:07:45.639] And I'm kind of validating myself into thinking,
[00:07:45.639] 我其实是在自我安慰，让自己相信：
[00:07:48.040] oh, I'm like a good person for doing this.
[00:07:48.040] 哦，我这样做就像个好人。
[00:07:50.160] So then if I'm constantly in that mindset
[00:07:50.160] 所以，如果我一直处于那种心态下的话。
[00:07:52.459] and then something happens,
[00:07:52.459] 然后，一些事情发生了，
[00:07:53.600] I'm like, I can't fucking take this anymore
[00:07:53.600] 我真是受够了，再也忍受不了了。
[00:07:55.120] and I'm gonna out first.
[00:07:55.120] 我第一个出局。
[00:07:56.600] But I guess it's not like conscious while I'm doing it.
[00:07:56.600] 但我猜我在做这件事的时候并不是有意识的。
[00:07:58.959] I'm just more like, decision by decision.
[00:07:58.959] 我更倾向于一步一步来做决定。
[00:08:00.920] I'm like, oh, this is probably helpful.
[00:08:00.920] 我心想，哦，这或许会有帮助。
[00:08:02.600] Like I should probably do this.
[00:08:02.600] 我大概应该这么做。
[00:08:04.079] But I think it just builds up into like me thinking that there's like a long
[00:08:04.079] 但我认为这最终会让我产生一种想法，那就是存在一个很长一段时间。
[00:08:07.079] history of sacrifice.
[00:08:07.079] 牺牲的历史。
[00:08:08.480] But really it's not that serious.
[00:08:08.480] 但实际上并没有那么严重。
[00:08:10.680] Right.
[00:08:10.680] 正确的。
[00:08:11.160] Honestly, I could relate.
[00:08:11.160] 说实话，我感同身受。
[00:08:12.240] I think that would definitely lead to an outburst for me too.
[00:08:12.240] 我想如果换作是我，肯定也会情绪爆发。
[00:08:16.920] No, for sure.
[00:08:16.920] 不，绝对不是。
[00:08:17.759] I actually have a pretty funny story related to that.
[00:08:17.759] 我其实有个跟这事有关的挺搞笑的故事。
[00:08:20.439] And it also ties back to the travel thing too.
[00:08:20.439] 而且这也跟旅行有关。
[00:08:22.879] But so I went to France a few years ago with two of my friends.
[00:08:22.879] 所以几年前我和两个朋友去了法国。
[00:08:26.800] We're not very big planners, any of us,
[00:08:26.800] 我们几个都不太喜欢做计划，
[00:08:28.920] but because I'd never been there before,
[00:08:28.920] 但由于我以前从未去过那里，
[00:08:30.519] I probably planned a little bit more than usual
[00:08:30.519] 我可能比平时计划得更周全一些。
[00:08:32.320] and made itinerary.
[00:08:32.320] 并制定了行程。
[00:08:33.320] And then we went to that really famous museum,
[00:08:33.320] 然后我们去了那家非常有名的博物馆。
[00:08:36.360] not the Louvre, but the other one like-
[00:08:36.360] 不是卢浮宫，而是另一个类似卢浮宫的地方——
[00:08:38.600] Dorsay or something?
[00:08:38.600] 多尔赛岛之类的？
[00:08:39.440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:39.440] 是啊是啊。
[00:08:40.600] Okay, so none of us are like art people at all.
[00:08:40.600] 好吧，我们当中没有一个人是搞艺术的。
[00:08:43.960] I'm like never moved by art,
[00:08:43.960] 我几乎从未被艺术打动过。
[00:08:45.480] but I'm probably gonna have to go
[00:08:45.480] 但我可能得走了
[00:08:47.200] because it's like one of the most popular places.
[00:08:47.200] 因为它算是最受欢迎的地方之一。
[00:08:49.720] And low-key, I was kind of lying to myself
[00:08:49.720] 说实话，我其实是在自欺欺人。
[00:08:53.120] at the end of the city and going.
[00:08:53.120] 在城市的尽头，然后继续前进。
[00:08:55.600] So when we got there,
[00:08:55.600] 所以当我们到达那里时，
[00:08:56.440] my two friends were like super unimpressed
[00:08:56.440] 我的两个朋友对此都表现得非常不以为然。
[00:08:58.240] and I'm like 20 minutes in,
[00:08:58.240] 我已经玩了大概20分钟了，
[00:08:59.519] they're just like, is this cool, Brian?
[00:08:59.519] 他们就问：“布莱恩，这样酷吗？”
[00:09:01.080] You go take a look, like we'll just wait here.
[00:09:01.080] 你去看看吧，我们就在这儿等着。
[00:09:03.960] Let us know when you're done.
[00:09:03.960] 完成后请告知我们。
[00:09:05.240] It was pretty funny in a moment,
[00:09:05.240] 那一瞬间还挺搞笑的。
[00:09:06.399] but then after they kept roasting me about it.
[00:09:06.399] 但之后他们一直拿这件事嘲笑我。
[00:09:08.360] And because I did the planning,
[00:09:08.360] 因为我负责策划，
[00:09:10.559] I went off on the...
[00:09:10.559] 我出发了……
[00:09:11.960] I remember we were walking, leaving the museum.
[00:09:11.960] 我记得我们当时正走着，离开博物馆。
[00:09:16.279] I was like, you guys can't do that
[00:09:16.279] 我当时就想，你们不能这么做。
[00:09:17.759] if you're not gonna plan it.
[00:09:17.759] 如果你不打算计划的话。
[00:09:18.840] Oh my God.
[00:09:18.840] 我的天啊。
[00:09:19.679] And it was awkward for like 10 minutes.
[00:09:19.679] 气氛尴尬了大概十分钟。
[00:09:21.840] And then later I was like, sorry.
[00:09:21.840] 后来我就说，对不起。
[00:09:23.600] This is also funny because I cannot imagine Brian going off on
[00:09:23.600] 这也很搞笑，因为我无法想象布莱恩会突然发飙。
[00:09:28.159] someone. Okay it's cuz like one of them's like my best friend and the other
[00:09:28.159] 有人。好吧，因为其中一个是我最好的朋友，另一个
[00:09:31.519] guys like his brother so I'm really close to him. So it's kind of like what you're
[00:09:31.519] 我和他关系很好，因为他哥哥也很棒。所以这有点像你……
[00:09:34.399] saying because you're so comfortable with right. Right. Yeah I feel it's like
[00:09:34.399] 这么说是因为你觉得这样很舒服。对。是啊，我觉得就像
[00:09:37.600] people I wasn't as close to I'd definitely be on my best. No but that's
[00:09:37.600] 对于不太亲近的人，我肯定会表现得最好。不，但那是……
[00:09:42.960] valid. I feel like I have a similar story that I've actually shared on the pod before.
[00:09:42.960] 确实如此。我觉得我之前在播客里也分享过类似的经历。
[00:09:48.279] It was when I went on a family trip to Hawaii last year, and I basically planned the whole
[00:09:48.279] 那是去年我和家人去夏威夷旅行的时候，我基本上策划了整个行程。
[00:09:53.240] thing.
[00:09:53.240] 事物。
[00:09:54.240] And I was like, you know, none of us have been to Hawaii.
[00:09:54.240] 我当时就想，你知道，我们谁都没去过夏威夷。
[00:09:56.039] So originally I was going to go by myself, but maybe you guys should tag along.
[00:09:56.039] 我原本打算一个人去，但也许你们应该一起去。
[00:10:01.480] So I basically like planned everything, booked some dinners.
[00:10:01.480] 所以我基本上把所有事情都计划好了，还预订了一些晚餐。
[00:10:05.440] It wasn't that intricate,
[00:10:05.440] 其实没那么复杂。
[00:10:06.600] but it was just like putting the basic
[00:10:06.600] 但这就像是把基本要素都列出来一样。
[00:10:08.399] just of stuff together.
[00:10:08.399] 只是把东西堆在一起。
[00:10:09.779] I think my dad was kind of being difficult sometimes.
[00:10:09.779] 我觉得我爸爸有时候有点难搞。
[00:10:13.399] To be fair, he had to work remotely
[00:10:13.399] 公平地说，他当时必须远程办公。
[00:10:15.620] for some parts of the trip.
[00:10:15.620] 旅途中的某些路段。
[00:10:17.320] One night I had a dinner booked for all of us,
[00:10:17.320] 一天晚上，我为我们所有人预订了晚餐。
[00:10:19.879] and then my dad had been skipping a lot of the dinners.
[00:10:19.879] 然后，我爸爸就经常不参加晚饭。
[00:10:23.360] He was like, oh, what's the plan tonight?
[00:10:23.360] 他当时就问，哦，今晚有什么安排？
[00:10:24.799] And I was like, oh, we have dinner planned.? And I was like, oh, we have dinner plan.
[00:10:24.799] 我当时就想，哦，我们有晚餐计划吗？我当时就想，哦，我们有晚餐计划吗？
[00:10:26.039] And then I was like, oh, let me guess.
[00:10:26.039] 然后我就想，哦，让我猜猜。
[00:10:27.360] You're not coming.
[00:10:27.360] 你不能来。
[00:10:28.200] And he was like, you're right.
[00:10:28.200] 他当时说：“你说得对。”
[00:10:29.679] Actually, I was about to say that.
[00:10:29.679] 其实，我正要这么说。
[00:10:31.279] And I was like, dude, OK, actually,
[00:10:31.279] 我当时就想，老兄，好吧，其实……
[00:10:32.879] I can give you a ride then to the airport.
[00:10:32.879] 我可以送你去机场。
[00:10:34.960] And he was like, wait, what?
[00:10:34.960] 他当时就想，等等，什么？
[00:10:39.080] Every time I hear this, I'm mind-blowing by the fact
[00:10:39.080] 每次听到这句话，我都感到无比震惊。
[00:10:42.080] that you said that.
[00:10:42.080] 你说的那句话。
[00:10:43.159] It's so satisfying.
[00:10:43.159] 太令人满足了。
[00:10:44.799] I don't know.
[00:10:44.799] 我不知道。
[00:10:45.519] Yeah, you had that ready.
[00:10:45.519] 是的，你早就准备好了。
[00:10:46.639] Yeah.
[00:10:46.639] 是的。
[00:10:48.120] With a punchline in every day to the airport.
[00:10:48.120] 每天都带着笑话去机场。
[00:10:53.120] Literally when I said it though, I was like,
[00:10:53.120] 但实际上，我当时说这话的时候，心里是这样的：
[00:10:54.720] damn, like that hit.
[00:10:54.720] 该死，就像那一下。
[00:10:58.440] And I was like, oh shit, that was so clever.
[00:10:58.440] 我当时就想，哦，天哪，这真是太聪明了。
[00:11:00.320] Like go me.
[00:11:00.320] 就像我一样。
[00:11:02.360] I ate.
[00:11:02.360] 我吃了。
[00:11:04.120] You cleared Chris' door.
[00:11:04.120] 你把克里斯的门清空了。
[00:11:06.000] But yeah, I feel like also
[00:11:06.000] 但是，是的，我也觉得
[00:11:08.000] People say try not to bottle up your emotions
[00:11:08.000] 人们常说，尽量不要压抑自己的情绪。
[00:11:10.000] So, you know, maybe having outbursts is healthy.
[00:11:10.000] 所以，你知道，偶尔情绪爆发或许是件好事。
[00:11:13.000] Mmm, that's true.
[00:11:13.000] 嗯，没错。
[00:11:15.000] It's like interesting though.
[00:11:15.000] 挺有意思的。
[00:11:16.000] So I have a similar outbursts story
[00:11:16.000] 我也有过类似的情绪爆发经历。
[00:11:18.000] Except this time it wasn't rage
[00:11:18.000] 但这一次，并非愤怒。
[00:11:20.000] I was more like sad sort of
[00:11:20.000] 我当时更多的是感到难过。
[00:11:22.000] So there was a time where I went to Korea
[00:11:22.000] 所以，有段时间我去了韩国。
[00:11:24.000] With two other people And I was like the only Korean person
[00:11:24.000] 还有另外两个人，我好像是唯一的韩国人。
[00:11:27.279] on the trip.
[00:11:27.279] 在旅途中。
[00:11:28.120] So I had like planned the itinerary out and stuff.
[00:11:28.120] 所以我事先计划好了行程等等。
[00:11:30.600] And I was kind of like showing them around,
[00:11:30.600] 我当时就像是在带他们四处参观一样。
[00:11:32.840] except I'm American, so I'm not really showing anyone around.
[00:11:32.840] 但我毕竟是美国人，所以我其实并没有带任何人参观。
[00:11:35.759] Right, right.
[00:11:35.759] 对，对。
[00:11:36.600] I think all of it was like fine.
[00:11:36.600] 我觉得一切都挺好的。
[00:11:37.799] The people I was traveling were very like easygoing
[00:11:37.799] 我同行的那些人都很随和。
[00:11:40.080] and like down and do whatever.
[00:11:40.080] 然后就放松下来，随心所欲地做任何事。
[00:11:41.240] But the only thing is like,
[00:11:41.240] 但唯一的问题是，
[00:11:43.039] if you're the sole communicator,
[00:11:43.039] 如果你是唯一的沟通者，
[00:11:45.159] the only person who speaks that language,
[00:11:45.159] 唯一会说那种语言的人，
[00:11:46.799] I feel like it could be a little bit stressful.
[00:11:46.799] 我觉得这可能会有点压力。
[00:11:49.080] It's a lot of pressure.
[00:11:49.080] 压力很大。
[00:11:50.080] It is.
[00:11:50.080] 这是。
[00:11:50.919] And for some reason on that trip,
[00:11:50.919] 不知何故，在那次旅行中，
[00:11:52.559] every taxi driver I was talking to was really fucking rude.
[00:11:52.559] 我遇到的每个出租车司机都非常粗鲁无礼。
[00:11:56.120] Oh no.
[00:11:56.120] 哦，不。
[00:11:56.960] And I'm also sensitive.
[00:11:56.960] 而且我性格也很敏感。
[00:11:58.080] I'm prone to be offended.
[00:11:58.080] 我很容易生气。
[00:12:00.440] So then it felt extra rude to me.
[00:12:00.440] 所以我觉得这格外无礼。
[00:12:02.879] So then this one time,
[00:12:02.879] 所以有那么一次，
[00:12:04.200] probably the sixth or seventh
[00:12:04.200] 可能是第六或第七个
[00:12:05.879] rude taxi driver or some shit.
[00:12:05.879] 粗鲁的出租车司机之类的。
[00:12:07.519] And I was like, you know what?
[00:12:07.519] 我当时就想，你知道吗？
[00:12:08.679] I'm like so fucking over this, right?
[00:12:08.679] 我真的受够了，对吧？
[00:12:10.320] So I was sitting in the back,
[00:12:10.320] 所以我当时坐在后面，
[00:12:11.519] like in the very back of this van
[00:12:11.519] 就像这辆面包车的最后面那样
[00:12:13.159] and then the two people I was traveling with,
[00:12:13.159] 然后还有和我一起旅行的两个人，
[00:12:14.600] they were in the middle.
[00:12:14.600] 他们位于中间。
[00:12:15.600] And I just started like sobbing.
[00:12:15.600] 然后我就开始嚎啕大哭。
[00:12:17.480] And it's like, if you think about it,
[00:12:17.480] 仔细想想，这就像……
[00:12:18.799] it's like, oh, the taxi driver was rude.
[00:12:18.799] 就好像，哦，出租车司机态度很差。
[00:12:20.399] It's like whatever, right?
[00:12:20.399] 反正都无所谓啦，对吧？
[00:12:21.440] But I think because it was constantly happening,
[00:12:21.440] 但我认为，正因为这种情况不断发生，
[00:12:23.879] I was like, oh, literally just dying in the back.
[00:12:23.879] 我当时就想，哦，我简直快要晕倒了。
[00:12:28.519] I mean, I feel like that's understandable.
[00:12:28.519] 我觉得这可以理解。
[00:12:30.600] It's very valid.
[00:12:30.600] 这很有道理。
[00:12:31.440] Yeah.
[00:12:31.440] 是的。
[00:12:31.799] Your frustration, it's also the travel thing.
[00:12:31.799] 你的沮丧，也是因为旅行的缘故。
[00:12:33.639] Like you're really tired.
[00:12:33.639] 就像你真的很累一样。
[00:12:34.720] Yeah.
[00:12:34.720] 是的。
[00:12:35.600] And then your frustration's building up a lot.
[00:12:35.600] 然后你的挫败感就会不断累积。
[00:12:37.559] There's kind of a tipping point where you're just like,
[00:12:37.559] 总会有一个临界点，到了那个点，你会觉得，
[00:12:39.799] dude, I'm so over this.
[00:12:39.799] 老兄，我真的受够了。
[00:12:41.720] Your brain is on overdrive, like translating everything,
[00:12:41.720] 你的大脑高速运转，仿佛在翻译所有东西。
[00:12:45.519] speaking English to your friends
[00:12:45.519] 用英语和朋友们交流
[00:12:47.159] and then like speaking Korean to everyone else.
[00:12:47.159] 然后就像跟其他人说韩语一样。
[00:12:49.840] I feel like it's a lot.
[00:12:49.840] 我觉得这太多了。
[00:12:51.200] That's true.
[00:12:51.200] 这是真的。
[00:12:52.179] And it's also like a big city.
[00:12:52.179] 它也像一座大城市。
[00:12:53.679] I'm assuming you're in Seoul.
[00:12:53.679] 我猜你现在在首尔。
[00:12:55.200] And so like a lot of stimulation around you.
[00:12:55.200] 所以，就像你周围有很多刺激一样。
[00:12:57.440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:57.440] 是啊是啊。
[00:12:59.039] I know traveling just makes us so sensitive, I guess.
[00:12:59.039] 我知道旅行会让我们变得特别敏感。
[00:13:02.200] Oh my God, I had traveled to Tokyo recently.
[00:13:02.200] 我的天哪，我最近去过东京。
[00:13:05.679] I was like, dude, I'm literally like a mute here.
[00:13:05.679] 我当时就想，老兄，我在这里简直就像个哑巴。
[00:13:08.700] Dude, I just went to Tokyo and I felt exactly right.
[00:13:08.700] 老兄，我刚去了趟东京，感觉棒极了。
[00:13:13.200] Yeah.
[00:13:13.200] 是的。
[00:13:14.500] And then I would like go home and I'd be like,
[00:13:14.500] 然后我就想回家，然后我会想，
[00:13:16.279] oh my god, I need to make sure to talk to myself
[00:13:16.279] 我的天哪，我得记得跟自己对话。
[00:13:18.240] because I don't think I've heard my voice
[00:13:18.240] 因为我觉得我没听到自己的声音。
[00:13:19.799] for like the best two cobwebs in your mouth.
[00:13:19.799] 就像嘴里最好的两片蜘蛛网。
[00:13:22.879] The reason I bring this up is because I was browsing TikTok
[00:13:22.879] 我之所以提起这件事，是因为我当时在浏览TikTok。
[00:13:26.159] and then I saw some other people that were like,
[00:13:26.159] 然后我看到其他人也像这样，
[00:13:28.279] yeah, I traveled to Japan recently, usually Tokyo,
[00:13:28.279] 是的，我最近去了日本，主要是东京。
[00:13:31.879] and they're like, it is super fun,
[00:13:31.879] 他们说，这超级好玩。
[00:13:33.600] but also so overwhelming, because the city is big,
[00:13:33.600] 但同时也让人感到不知所措，因为这座城市太大了。
[00:13:36.639] you don't speak the language, you're like,
[00:13:36.639] 你不会说这种语言，你就像……
[00:13:38.879] what do I say?
[00:13:38.879] 我该说什么？
[00:13:40.080] Maybe one Japanese phrase.
[00:13:40.080] 或许一句日语短语。
[00:13:43.159] And then the girl was literally making the TikTok and sobbing.
[00:13:43.159] 然后，那个女孩一边拍TikTok视频一边哭。
[00:13:46.480] She's like, I don't know why I'm crying.
[00:13:46.480] 她说道：“我不知道我为什么哭了。”
[00:13:49.279] I'm just overstimulated for like, it's not that deep.
[00:13:49.279] 我只是有点过度兴奋，没那么严重。
[00:13:52.960] I was like, this is such a valid TikTok.
[00:13:52.960] 我当时就想，这真是个很棒的TikTok视频。
[00:13:56.720] Yeah, I just went to Japan and Korea over Christmas, and then it was like a two and
[00:13:56.720] 是的，我圣诞节期间去了日本和韩国，然后就过了两三天。
[00:14:02.600] half week stay in those two countries.
[00:14:02.600] 在这两个国家待半周。
[00:14:04.679] And when I got back to America
[00:14:04.679] 当我回到美国时
[00:14:05.879] I was like I've never been so happy
[00:14:05.879] 我当时想，我从未如此开心过。
[00:14:09.240] In my life like the passport guys like welcome back. I'm like, thanks
[00:14:09.240] 在我的生活中，就像护照检查员说“欢迎回来”一样。我心想，谢谢。
[00:14:15.399] Like get every word in you can actually
[00:14:15.399] 就像尽可能把每个字都写进去一样
[00:14:18.679] My god, that's so funny when you go into like restaurants and stuff. I guess you can pass for right right local
[00:14:18.679] 我的天，这事儿太搞笑了，尤其是在去餐馆之类的地方。我觉得你看起来就像个地道的本地人。
[00:14:24.639] So over and over again just like oh no like like and stuff, I guess you can pass for a local. So over and over again, just like, oh no, like, you know, like just reading like I'm not.
[00:14:24.639] 所以一遍又一遍，就像“哦不”之类的，我想你可以冒充本地人。所以一遍又一遍，就像“哦不”之类的，你知道，就像读着读着就好像我不是本地人一样。
[00:14:29.399] Yeah.
[00:14:29.399] 是的。
[00:14:30.559] The disappointment in there after like another tourist.
[00:14:30.559] 之后的那种失望感，就像其他游客一样。
[00:14:35.200] Do you guys think you have outbursts outside of travel?
[00:14:35.200] 你们觉得除了旅行之外，自己也会有情绪爆发的时候吗？
[00:14:38.600] Not often, but like, I was like thinking about this.
[00:14:38.600] 虽然不常有，但我刚才确实在想这件事。
[00:14:42.519] There's definitely a few I can pinpoint over the last few years and I feel like a lot of times
[00:14:42.519] 过去几年里，我肯定能指出几个例子，而且我觉得很多时候
[00:14:47.039] when something's gnawing at like something
[00:14:47.039] 当有什么东西像啃噬一样啃噬着什么的时候
[00:14:48.559] you're self-conscious about and it's like,
[00:14:48.559] 你对此感到不自在，感觉就像是，
[00:14:50.980] honestly a lot of times it's like your friends
[00:14:50.980] 说实话，很多时候就像你的朋友一样
[00:14:53.000] or like your bros.
[00:14:53.000] 或者像你的兄弟们一样。
[00:14:54.679] But yeah, like there's been a few times
[00:14:54.679] 是的，这种情况发生过好几次了。
[00:14:57.559] you're kind of at your limit.
[00:14:57.559] 你已经差不多到极限了。
[00:14:58.840] Mm hmm.
[00:14:58.840] 嗯。
[00:14:59.840] I feel like that is very understandable
[00:14:59.840] 我觉得这完全可以理解。
[00:15:01.759] and I think especially maybe if people are taking advantage of some sort of leniency or patience that you have for them,
[00:15:01.759] 而且我觉得，尤其当有人滥用你对他们的宽容或耐心时，情况可能就更糟了。
[00:15:10.000] kind of similar to what you were saying earlier to Jisoo, how like you feel like you were being patient with people or giving them leniency and then it just like keeps happening,
[00:15:10.000] 有点像你之前跟Jisoo说的那样，感觉你一直对别人很有耐心，很宽容，但这种事却不断发生。
[00:15:19.000] I can totally see how that would like build up and then at a certain point you're like, all right, like this is where we draw the line.
[00:15:19.000] 我完全可以理解这种情况是如何逐渐形成的，然后到了某个时候，你就会想，好吧，这就是我们的底线。
[00:15:32.559] I think I can relate to that and for me, I think my outbursts actually happen at work sometimes.
[00:15:32.559] 我觉得我能理解这种感受，而且对我来说，我觉得我的情绪爆发有时确实发生在工作场所。
[00:15:37.759] So I guess at work, it's not necessarily like a huge emotional outburst, right? But I think it feels more like an intense outburst because I'm still trying to keep it contained
[00:15:37.759] 所以我觉得在工作中，这不一定算是情绪大爆发，对吧？但我感觉更像是强烈的情绪爆发，因为我还在努力控制自己。
[00:15:42.879] during the outburst. Like a professional outburst.
[00:15:42.879] 在情绪爆发期间。就像职业人士的情绪爆发一样。
[00:15:45.639] Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:45.639] 对，没错。
[00:15:46.279] Exactly.
[00:15:46.279] 确切地。
[00:15:47.279] Oh my god.
[00:15:47.279] 我的天啊。
[00:15:49.279] And I think it always happens on tough work weeks
[00:15:49.279] 我觉得这种情况总是在工作繁忙的几周发生。
[00:15:51.480] where maybe you're putting in some long hours
[00:15:51.480] 也许你正在投入大量时间
[00:15:53.480] or honestly times where you feel like you're picking
[00:15:53.480] 或者老实说，有时候你觉得自己像是在挑剔。
[00:15:56.679] up assignments for other people as a favor.
[00:15:56.679] 帮别人完成任务，纯属帮忙。
[00:15:59.360] I feel like it really gets to me.
[00:15:59.360] 我觉得这件事真的让我很难过。
[00:16:01.480] It hasn't happened recently, but in my professional career
[00:16:01.480] 这种情况最近没有发生过，但在我的职业生涯中确实发生过。
[00:16:04.399] I have had a time where I cried during a TV with my boss
[00:16:04.399] 我曾经和老板一起看电视时哭过。
[00:16:08.960] and I was just like,
[00:16:08.960] 我当时就想，
[00:16:09.799] I don't think it's anymore.
[00:16:09.799] 我觉得已经不是这样了。
[00:16:11.159] Like there's so many assignments and blah blah blah.
[00:16:11.159] 好像有很多作业之类的，等等等等。
[00:16:13.600] And then he was like,
[00:16:13.600] 然后他就说，
[00:16:15.200] honestly, I wish you weren't crying,
[00:16:15.200] 说实话，我希望你没哭。
[00:16:16.759] but I totally understand and hear you.
[00:16:16.759] 但我完全理解你的意思。
[00:16:18.559] So let's like cut back on the workload and whatnot.
[00:16:18.559] 所以，咱们就减少一些工作量之类的吧。
[00:16:21.519] So I think even though it was like embarrassing,
[00:16:21.519] 所以我觉得，虽然这有点尴尬，
[00:16:24.879] like Brian mentioned before, I still even though it was like embarrassing, like Brian mentioned before,
[00:16:24.879] 就像布莱恩之前提到的那样，虽然这有点尴尬，但我仍然……
[00:16:26.399] I still feel like it was a productive outburst
[00:16:26.399] 我仍然觉得那是一次富有成效的爆发。
[00:16:28.840] because it got the message through a little bit.
[00:16:28.840] 因为它确实传达了一些信息。
[00:16:32.080] Damn, professional and productive.
[00:16:32.080] 真棒，专业又高效。
[00:16:33.879] Yeah.
[00:16:33.879] 是的。
[00:16:34.720] Yeah.
[00:16:34.720] 是的。
[00:16:35.720] Double wins.
[00:16:35.720] 双赢。
[00:16:37.919] I could totally see how work can cause outburst though,
[00:16:37.919] 我完全可以理解工作为什么会引发情绪爆发。
[00:16:41.200] but I feel like maybe in my personal experience,
[00:16:41.200] 但我感觉，或许就我个人经验而言，
[00:16:44.600] it would be more outbursts outside of work because of work.
[00:16:44.600] 因为工作原因，工作之外的情绪爆发会更多。
[00:16:47.679] Right?
[00:16:47.679] 正确的？
[00:16:48.519] Because that's a good point.
[00:16:48.519] 因为那确实是个好观点。
[00:16:49.559] I think it's very natural to get frustrated at work.
[00:16:49.559] 我认为在工作中感到沮丧是很正常的。
[00:16:52.600] Sometimes it feels like everyone's just doing nothing
[00:16:52.600] 有时感觉大家都无所事事
[00:16:54.879] and then you're like along for the wave of like nothing
[00:16:54.879] 然后你就就像随波逐流，什么也得不到满足。
[00:16:58.639] or it just feels like things aren't getting done
[00:16:58.639] 或者感觉事情都没做完。
[00:17:01.120] and like people are asking you to do this
[00:17:01.120] 就像有人要求你这样做一样
[00:17:02.679] but a hinge is on like all these other people.
[00:17:02.679] 但就像其他人一样，他也面临着一个棘手的问题。
[00:17:04.880] It's just so complicated and very prone to frustrations
[00:17:04.880] 它太复杂了，而且很容易让人感到沮丧。
[00:17:10.200] from everyone, I think.
[00:17:10.200] 我想，这大概是大家的想法吧。
[00:17:12.039] I know, sometimes I feel like work would be so easy
[00:17:12.039] 我知道，有时候我觉得工作会很容易。
[00:17:14.440] if there wasn't all this interpersonal relationship stuff
[00:17:14.440] 如果没有这些人际关系方面的事情的话。
[00:17:17.119] that you also had to do along with your assignments.
[00:17:17.119] 除了完成作业之外，你还得做这些。
[00:17:19.359] Oh, dude, actually though, some advice I had gotten was,
[00:17:19.359] 哦，兄弟，其实我得到的一些建议是：
[00:17:24.079] don't forget that your coworkers are people too.
[00:17:24.079] 别忘了你的同事也是人。
[00:17:27.180] That advice is kind of like,
[00:17:27.180] 这种建议有点像是：
[00:17:29.279] oh, if you build a better relationship with your coworkers
[00:17:29.279] 哦，如果你能和同事建立更好的关系……
[00:17:34.000] and they like you more than usually everyone is down
[00:17:34.000] 他们比平时更喜欢你，大家都很沮丧。
[00:17:36.940] to give each other more leniency.
[00:17:36.940] 互相宽容一些。
[00:17:38.859] That's true.
[00:17:38.859] 这是真的。
[00:17:39.700] But I guess if we were all just purely cogs, numbers,
[00:17:39.700] 但我想，如果我们都只是纯粹的齿轮、数字，
[00:17:45.299] maybe it would be more strict,
[00:17:45.299] 或许会更严格一些。
[00:17:46.900] but we would all get shit done.
[00:17:46.900] 但我们都能把事情做成。
[00:17:48.259] Yeah.
[00:17:48.259] 是的。
[00:17:49.740] There was a funny moment at work,
[00:17:49.740] 工作中发生了一件趣事。
[00:17:51.859] ones where I witnessed someone else's outburst.
[00:17:51.859] 那些我亲眼目睹别人情绪爆发的场景。
[00:17:54.660] And I think I thought it was funny
[00:17:54.660] 我觉得这挺搞笑的。
[00:17:56.140] because I didn't personally have emotional stakes
[00:17:56.140] 因为我个人没有情感上的牵连。
[00:17:59.099] in the situation at hand,
[00:17:59.099] 就目前的情况而言，
[00:18:00.839] but watching someone else outburst at work
[00:18:00.839] 但看到别人在工作中情绪爆发……
[00:18:03.420] is a very interesting experience, I would say.
[00:18:03.420] 我认为这是一次非常有趣的经历。
[00:18:06.099] I feel like it kind of feels good in a sense that like everyone is
[00:18:06.099] 我觉得从某种意义上来说，这感觉挺好的，就像每个人都……
[00:18:09.660] kind of bottling emotions at work.
[00:18:09.660] 在工作中，有点像是在压抑自己的情绪。
[00:18:11.279] Like no one is really trying to show it.
[00:18:11.279] 好像没人真正想把它展现出来。
[00:18:13.039] So then when you see it for the first time, it's kind of like a release,
[00:18:13.039] 所以当你第一次看到它的时候，感觉就像是一种释放。
[00:18:16.019] like, Oh, other people also have emotions and feelings.
[00:18:16.019] 比如，哦，其他人也有情感和感觉。
[00:18:18.940] And it's like very normal and human.
[00:18:18.940] 这很正常，也很人性化。
[00:18:20.900] But also it's because it's supposed to be such a professional environment.
[00:18:20.900] 但也是因为这应该是一个非常专业的环境。
[00:18:24.839] It also feels and looks very out of place. one human, but also because it's supposed to be such a professional environment, it also
[00:18:24.839] 它给人的感觉和看起来都非常不协调。不仅因为这里应该是一个专业的环境，而且因为只有一个人，所以也显得格格不入。
[00:18:25.200] feels and looks very out of place.
[00:18:25.200] 感觉和看起来都非常不协调。
[00:18:27.640] So I just remember this person kind of like outbursts in a meeting which triggered another
[00:18:27.640] 所以我只记得这个人曾在一次会议上突然情绪爆发，这引发了另一件事。
[00:18:32.039] person to outbursts.
[00:18:32.039] 容易情绪爆发的人。
[00:18:33.039] Oh my god.
[00:18:33.039] 我的天啊。
[00:18:34.039] So they were like kind of yelling at each other and then the rest of us were like muted.
[00:18:34.039] 所以他们就像是在互相大声喊叫，而我们其他人则都保持沉默。
[00:18:37.440] Like some people started turning their cameras off and I was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[00:18:37.440] 有些人开始关掉摄像头，我当时就想，我的天，这也太疯狂了吧。
[00:18:41.880] Oh my god.
[00:18:41.880] 我的天啊。
[00:18:42.880] I actually had that exact same experience when I was interning.
[00:18:42.880] 我实习的时候也有过完全一样的经历。
[00:18:46.799] We had like a sprint planning meeting and then the PM and the leads software engineer
[00:18:46.799] 我们开了一次类似冲刺计划会议的会议，然后项目经理和首席软件工程师都参加了。
[00:18:51.539] just like disagreed on this work task and how long it would take and it's just evolved
[00:18:51.539] 就像当初我们对这项工作任务以及所需时间存在分歧，后来就慢慢演变成现在这样了。
[00:18:56.180] into like a straight up like shouting match.
[00:18:56.180] 变成了一场直接的争吵。
[00:18:58.440] Oh my God.
[00:18:58.440] 我的天啊。
[00:18:59.440] Yeah.
[00:18:59.440] 是的。
[00:19:00.440] And then this was like, I think that was like two or three weeks into the internship.
[00:19:00.440] 然后，大概是在实习开始两三周后，发生了这件事。
[00:19:03.839] And then it was when those were like,
[00:19:03.839] 然后，当那些事情像……的时候
[00:19:06.200] the meeting was ending,
[00:19:06.200] 会议即将结束。
[00:19:07.359] the tensions weren't cooling at all.
[00:19:07.359] 紧张局势丝毫没有缓和。
[00:19:09.480] So I remember like my mentor at the time was like,
[00:19:09.480] 我记得当时我的导师是这么说的：
[00:19:11.960] oh, like you can go first.
[00:19:11.960] 哦，好像你可以先走似的。
[00:19:13.640] She like messaged me and she was like,
[00:19:13.640] 她给我发了条信息，她说：
[00:19:15.240] it's not usually like this.
[00:19:15.240] 通常情况下并非如此。
[00:19:16.400] I swear like.
[00:19:16.400] 我发誓。
[00:19:18.000] She's like, please stay.
[00:19:18.000] 她就像在说，请留下来。
[00:19:19.559] I was like, but you're right.
[00:19:19.559] 我当时就想，但你说得对。
[00:19:21.480] It was really interesting and low-key entertaining.
[00:19:21.480] 真的很有意思，而且轻松愉快。
[00:19:24.079] Be honest.
[00:19:24.079] 要诚实。
[00:19:24.920] I was just like, but you're right. It was really interesting and low-key entertaining. Yeah. Be honest, I was just like, damn.
[00:19:24.920] 我当时就想，不过你说得对。这真的很有意思，而且挺有娱乐性的。是啊。说实话，我当时就想，哇。
[00:19:27.680] I had an experience. It wasn't like a true outburst, but I think it was like a stern mini outburst.
[00:19:27.680] 我经历了一件事。那不算是一次真正的情绪爆发，但我觉得像是一次比较严厉的轻微爆发。
[00:19:36.400] Like one time me and a couple, it was actually also an internship. Me and a couple of my co-workers, we wanted to work on a project and we had some
[00:19:36.400] 比如有一次，我和一对夫妇一起做项目，那其实也是一次实习。我和几个同事想一起做一个项目，我们有一些……
[00:19:47.359] ideas to present. But for some reason, the meeting we booked with someone who was like,
[00:19:47.359] 有一些想法想要提出来。但不知为何，我们预约的那个人却说，
[00:19:52.720] higher up, I think she was like director level, we weren't ready for it.
[00:19:52.720] 我觉得她职位更高，大概是总监级别，我们当时还没准备好。
[00:19:56.640] And so we were going at the meeting and we're kind of like, oh wait, we might not be ready
[00:19:56.640] 所以，我们去开会的时候，突然意识到，哎呀，我们可能还没准备好。
[00:20:01.440] for this meeting. She hops on the phone and then we're like,
[00:20:01.440] 为了这次会议。她拿起电话，然后我们就说，
[00:20:05.720] um, yeah, we're like trying desperately to explain.
[00:20:05.720] 嗯，是啊，我们正在拼命地解释。
[00:20:09.440] Like our ideas, I guess.
[00:20:09.440] 我想，大概是和我们的想法一样吧。
[00:20:10.960] And then maybe like after a couple minutes,
[00:20:10.960] 然后可能过了几分钟之后，
[00:20:13.559] she was like, okay, I think it seems like
[00:20:13.559] 她当时就说，好吧，我觉得看起来像是
[00:20:16.000] you are all still in the brainstorming phase right now.
[00:20:16.000] 你们现在都还处于集思广益阶段。
[00:20:20.359] So how about we set up a meeting later
[00:20:20.359] 那我们稍后安排个会面怎么样？
[00:20:22.240] when you feel more ready?
[00:20:22.240] 你觉得什么时候更准备好了？
[00:20:23.559] That way we can all use our time wisely
[00:20:23.559] 这样我们都能明智地利用时间。
[00:20:26.099] Oh my god, and and then you know she left and we were all like
[00:20:26.099] 我的天哪，然后她就走了，我们当时都懵了。
[00:20:29.759] Yeah, like we that was not good
[00:20:29.759] 是的，就像我们那样，那可不好。
[00:20:33.559] You know, I feel like what I find kind of funny about watching other people out first though is
[00:20:33.559] 你知道吗，我觉得看着别人先出局这件事本身挺搞笑的。
[00:20:41.319] Your outburst story crystal seems like it was handled in a very mature way.
[00:20:41.319] 你的情绪爆发故事处理得非常成熟。
[00:20:45.599] But honestly, sometimes even the work ones, it kind of devolves into almost childish behavior
[00:20:45.599] 但说实话，有时候即使是工作上的那些事，也会演变成近乎幼稚的行为。
[00:20:51.680] because at the root of it, when we were young, we didn't have as much control over our emotions.
[00:20:51.680] 因为归根结底，当我们年轻的时候，我们对自己的情绪没有那么强的控制力。
[00:20:56.000] So I feel like that's the last time we were able to let our emotions run freely,
[00:20:56.000] 所以我觉得那是我们最后一次能够自由地表达自己的情感了。
[00:21:01.279] like unregulated. But now in our adulthood, like sometimes it comes out
[00:21:01.279] 就像不受监管一样。但现在我们成年了，有时候它会爆发出来。
[00:21:06.579] professionally, but other times I'm like, okay,
[00:21:06.579] 专业上是这样，但其他时候我就会想，好吧，
[00:21:08.539] these people are like two minutes away from becoming
[00:21:08.539] 这些人离成为
[00:21:11.740] like a childhood playground sort of thing,
[00:21:11.740] 就像童年游乐场那样的地方，
[00:21:14.619] where they're like walking each other and trying to get.
[00:21:14.619] 他们就像互相试探、互相吸引一样。
[00:21:18.019] I would love to see that in a meeting.
[00:21:18.019] 我很想在会议上看到这一点。
[00:21:19.420] Oh yeah.
[00:21:19.420] 哦，是的。
[00:21:20.259] I would love it.
[00:21:20.259] 我非常喜欢。
[00:21:22.059] I think one of the out first story I was mentioning earlier, one of the last few lines was like,
[00:21:22.059] 我觉得我之前提到的第一个故事里，最后几句话是这样的：
[00:21:26.240] Oh yeah, I'm gonna take this up with upper management football, but and I was like,
[00:21:26.240] 哦，是的，我会把这件事上报给足球界的高层管理人员，但我当时就想，
[00:21:29.599] Oh, he's about to tattle on the teacher.
[00:21:29.599] 哦，他又要告老师的状了。
[00:21:34.400] Dude, one of my friends, she has like a honestly really immature team.
[00:21:34.400] 老兄，我一个朋友的团队真的非常不成熟。
[00:21:38.240] She's like a PM on it. So she's like in the center of it, but she was like showing me their slag chat once and she was like,
[00:21:38.240] 她就像是项目经理一样。所以她处于核心地位，但她之前给我看过他们的闲聊记录，她说：
[00:21:44.160] Dude, is this normal? Like this is happening on the team so basically there
[00:21:44.160] 老兄，这正常吗？这种事居然发生在我们队里，所以基本上……
[00:21:47.680] was these two lead engineers and they're arguing over route A or route B which
[00:21:47.680] 这两位首席工程师正在争论采用路线 A 还是路线 B。
[00:21:52.059] was gonna take and then the first guy was like super stubborn just not
[00:21:52.059] 本来打算拍的，结果第一个人特别固执，就是不肯。
[00:21:55.480] listening to anything and then the second I was like you know what like you
[00:21:55.480] 听着任何东西，然后第二秒我就想，你知道吗，就像你
[00:21:58.880] never listen to me at all like you go with whatever you want I'm done and in
[00:21:58.880] 你从来不听我的，想干嘛就干嘛，我受够了。
[00:22:02.559] the first guy was like okay so route it And she showed me that I was like, dude,
[00:22:02.559] 第一个人说，好吧，那就规划路线。然后她给我看了，我当时就想，老兄，
[00:22:08.420] your team is so toxic.
[00:22:08.420] 你的团队太糟糕了。
[00:22:09.859] That's so funny.
[00:22:09.859] 太搞笑了。
[00:22:11.339] Oh my god.
[00:22:11.339] 我的天啊。
[00:22:12.180] He's like, okay, I won't.
[00:22:12.180] 他说道，好吧，我不干了。
[00:22:14.140] I guess for these outbursts
[00:22:14.140] 我想对于这些爆发
[00:22:15.660] that we've just been talking about,
[00:22:15.660] 就是我们刚才一直在谈论的那个，
[00:22:16.900] a lot of the emotion is frustration.
[00:22:16.900] 很多情绪都是沮丧。
[00:22:19.819] But do you feel like there's other emotions
[00:22:19.819] 但你是否觉得还有其他情绪
[00:22:21.900] that are also tied to these kinds of outbursts?
[00:22:21.900] 还有哪些因素也与这类情绪爆发有关？
[00:22:24.779] So for me, I would say I have two very predominant outbursts related emotions and I'm just
[00:22:24.779] 所以对我来说，我觉得我有两种非常主要的与情绪爆发相关的因素，而我只是
[00:22:30.599] gonna make a disclaimer that they're both very childish.
[00:22:30.599] 首先声明，他们俩都很幼稚。
[00:22:34.000] So one is sheer unadulterated rage where I'm like fuck this, fuck the world, fuck everything.
[00:22:34.000] 一种是纯粹的、毫无保留的愤怒，我心想：去他妈的，去他妈的世界，去他妈的一切。
[00:22:39.759] And then the other one is feeling very wronged, which I feel like to me that is like peak childish.
[00:22:39.759] 而另一个人则感到非常委屈，我觉得这简直是幼稚到了极点。
[00:22:46.200] That's what happens when you're like a kid and you're like,
[00:22:46.200] 当你像个孩子一样的时候，就会发生这种情况，你会想：
[00:22:48.480] why does mom want me to do this?
[00:22:48.480] 妈妈为什么要我做这件事？
[00:22:49.880] Or like whatever?
[00:22:49.880] 或者其他什么？
[00:22:50.880] So then every time I feel that way,
[00:22:50.880] 所以每当我有这种感觉的时候，
[00:22:52.240] I have to like really talk myself back into adulthood.
[00:22:52.240] 我得好好说服自己重新振作起来，回到成年人的状态。
[00:22:56.880] Interesting.
[00:22:56.880] 有趣的。
[00:22:58.359] When I heard the question, honestly,
[00:22:58.359] 听到这个问题时，老实说，
[00:22:59.839] I feel like the root of it is always frustration,
[00:22:59.839] 我觉得问题的根源始终在于挫败感。
[00:23:01.799] but if you're listening to what you said,
[00:23:01.799] 但如果你仔细听听自己说过的话，
[00:23:03.880] I think it kind of boils down to those two for me too.
[00:23:03.880] 我觉得对我来说，最终也归结于这两件事。
[00:23:08.440] So yeah.
[00:23:08.440] 是的。
[00:23:10.440] Let's go.
[00:23:10.440] 我们走吧。
[00:23:12.119] Yeah, I think maybe rage is not as high for me,
[00:23:12.119] 是的，我觉得我的愤怒情绪可能没有那么强烈。
[00:23:16.079] but I can agree with the wrong.
[00:23:16.079] 但我可以同意错误的观点。
[00:23:18.039] Like you just feel, I don't even,
[00:23:18.039] 就像你感觉到的那样，我甚至都不知道，
[00:23:19.880] yeah, there's no other way to describe it, right?
[00:23:19.880] 是啊，没有别的办法来形容了，对吧？
[00:23:21.480] Like you've been wrong.
[00:23:21.480] 好像你错了似的。
[00:23:22.960] I feel like that would make most people pretty upset.
[00:23:22.960] 我觉得这会让大多数人非常生气。
[00:23:26.200] And then I guess like the other feeling
[00:23:26.200] 然后，我想就像另一种感觉一样。
[00:23:29.019] is a bit more like frustration or annoyance.
[00:23:29.019] 更像是沮丧或恼怒。
[00:23:32.460] I'm thinking about this thing where this person was like,
[00:23:32.460] 我在想这件事，就是这个人当时说的：
[00:23:35.200] oh my God, I got this like wheel of emotions.
[00:23:35.200] 我的天哪，我感觉自己像坐过山车一样，各种情绪交织在一起。
[00:23:39.400] And now I use it to truly define what emotions I'm feeling.
[00:23:39.400] 现在我用它来真正定义我感受到的情绪。
[00:23:44.099] And I was like, whoa, maybe some of the emotions
[00:23:44.099] 我当时就想，哇，也许有些情绪
[00:23:46.480] we think we're feeling is actually like a different emotion.
[00:23:46.480] 我们以为自己感受到的情绪，实际上却是另一种不同的情绪。
[00:23:49.240] Whoa.
[00:23:49.240] 哇。
[00:23:50.079] So it's not just like sad or mad.
[00:23:50.079] 所以它不仅仅是悲伤或愤怒。
[00:23:51.759] It's like more nuanced.
[00:23:51.759] 它更细致入微。
[00:23:53.359] There's depth to it.
[00:23:53.359] 它很有深度。
[00:23:54.279] Yeah.
[00:23:54.279] 是的。
[00:23:55.279] Yeah.
[00:23:55.279] 是的。
[00:23:55.799] Wait, so how does the wheel of emotion thing work?
[00:23:55.799] 等等，那么情绪轮盘究竟是如何运作的呢？
[00:23:58.240] I think it's just like a list or a wheel for that person
[00:23:58.240] 我觉得对那个人来说，这就像是一张清单或者一个轮盘。
[00:24:01.519] that has all these different emotions.
[00:24:01.519] 它包含了所有这些不同的情感。
[00:24:03.599] And then it has a little definition under it.
[00:24:03.599] 然后下面还有一段简短的定义。
[00:24:06.079] Yeah, so I'm trying to think of an example, but like I can only think of the basic emotions.
[00:24:06.079] 是啊，我正在努力想一个例子，但我只能想到一些基本的情绪。
[00:24:11.519] Rage.
[00:24:11.519] 愤怒。
[00:24:14.240] I think I've seen one where it's like a wheel, but there's kind of like funnels.
[00:24:14.240] 我好像见过一个，形状像轮子，但又有点像漏斗。
[00:24:19.279] So it's like it starts with like the three like big ones like oh sad or mad or whatever.
[00:24:19.279] 所以，它就像是从三个大的情绪开始的，比如悲伤、愤怒等等。
[00:24:24.640] And then it boils down into like, oh, I'm upset
[00:24:24.640] 然后就归结为，哦，我很难过。
[00:24:27.279] or like I'm depressed or, you know,
[00:24:27.279] 或者感觉自己很沮丧，或者，你知道的，
[00:24:29.079] like more categorized levels, I guess.
[00:24:29.079] 就像更细致的分类级别一样。
[00:24:32.720] I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:32.720] 我觉得这很有道理。
[00:24:33.839] I feel like when something happens,
[00:24:33.839] 我觉得当某件事发生时，
[00:24:35.559] you'll relate to the most overarching emotion,
[00:24:35.559] 你会与最普遍的情感产生共鸣，
[00:24:38.480] the most like fear or not fear would fuck.
[00:24:38.480] 最有可能的恐惧，或者不恐惧，会搞砸一切。
[00:24:40.480] Whoa, you got something to say about it.
[00:24:40.480] 哇，你对此有话要说啊。
[00:24:43.119] Whoa, sorry, like frustration or like anger.
[00:24:43.119] 哇，抱歉，就像沮丧或愤怒一样。
[00:24:47.599] But as you like kind of sit on it and mullen it,
[00:24:47.599] 但你可以先仔细考虑一下。
[00:24:50.279] like you're processing how you feel about that's kind
[00:24:50.279] 就像你在思考你对此的感受一样，这很友善。
[00:24:52.400] of when the more under the surface emotions come out.
[00:24:52.400] 当内心深处的情感流露出来的时候。
[00:24:55.640] So I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:55.640] 所以我认为这很有道理。
[00:24:57.720] I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
[00:24:57.720] 我正在努力想还有没有其他事情。
[00:24:59.240] I think for me, also feeling misunderstood
[00:24:59.240] 我觉得对我来说，不被理解的感觉也是一种困扰。
[00:25:01.680] makes me very out-first prone as well.
[00:25:01.680] 这也让我很容易被对手先发制人。
[00:25:03.559] Mm, yeah.
[00:25:03.559] 嗯，是的。
[00:25:04.519] I guess it kind of falls under the feeling wrong category.
[00:25:04.519] 我觉得这应该算是感觉不对劲吧。
[00:25:07.200] Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:07.200] 是啊是啊。
[00:25:08.200] I'm a victim because blank.
[00:25:08.200] 我是受害者，因为……
[00:25:09.799] But feeling misunderstood or feeling like you're going unheard, I feel like, is really isolating.
[00:25:09.799] 但我觉得，感到不被理解或感觉自己的声音不被听到，真的会让人感到孤独。
[00:25:14.799] Yes.
[00:25:14.799] 是的。
[00:25:15.799] I definitely do think it has a lot to do with repression.
[00:25:15.799] 我确实认为这与压迫有很大关系。
[00:25:18.200] It's like the more I'm forced to repress something, the bigger the outburst is.
[00:25:18.200] 感觉我越是被迫压抑某些情绪，爆发出来的程度就越大。
[00:25:21.599] Oh my God, because you're bottling it up.
[00:25:21.599] 我的天哪，因为你把所有情绪都憋在心里了。
[00:25:24.000] Yeah. It's like a soda can about to explode.
[00:25:24.000] 是啊，就像一个快要爆炸的汽水罐。
[00:25:27.519] Thinking along what more specific feelings
[00:25:27.519] 思考着更具体的感受
[00:25:30.680] would maybe apply,
[00:25:30.680] 或许可以适用，
[00:25:32.200] kind of on the similar vein as what you said,
[00:25:32.200] 跟你说的有点类似，
[00:25:34.720] Jisoo, maybe feeling underappreciated.
[00:25:34.720] Jisoo，或许觉得自己没有得到应有的赏识。
[00:25:38.720] But I guess along the lines of the emotions that we feel,
[00:25:38.720] 但我想，就我们所感受到的情感而言，
[00:25:43.039] do you think you're the type to have more variance in your emotional
[00:25:43.039] 你觉得自己是那种情绪波动较大的人吗？
[00:25:47.759] state or are you like a little more, I guess, like steady in your typical day-to-day?
[00:25:47.759] 你是比较活跃的状态，还是更像，我猜，像你平常那样过着平静的生活？
[00:25:54.160] So I do feel like I'm the type to have higher highs and lower lows. I feel like on most days,
[00:25:54.160] 所以我觉得自己属于那种情绪波动较大的人，容易出现较大的情绪高峰和较小的情绪低谷。我觉得大多数时候，
[00:26:00.160] I feel pretty even killed. But I do feel like if something happens I'm pretty prone to being like emotionally affected by it. Where is that like?
[00:26:00.160] 我感觉自己都快要死了。但我确实觉得，如果发生了什么事，我很容易受到情绪上的影响。这种情况到底是怎么回事？
[00:26:07.700] I think it goes both ways like I get happy and like excited like pretty easily
[00:26:07.700] 我觉得这两种感觉都有，我很容易就会开心和兴奋。
[00:26:11.900] But I'll also get like dejected kind of easily to something's like not going right
[00:26:11.900] 但我也会因为事情进展不顺利而很容易感到沮丧。
[00:26:16.259] Actually, I think I can relate to that. I was reflecting kind of recently where I was thinking about like stressful situations and I can probably manage
[00:26:16.259] 其实，我觉得我能感同身受。我最近一直在反思，想到一些压力大的情况，我想我应该能应付得了。
[00:26:26.799] Mild stress, okay, but sometimes if it just feels like the world is against you. I like crumble
[00:26:26.799] 轻微的压力还可以接受，但有时候如果感觉全世界都在与你作对，那就糟了。我喜欢酥脆的东西。
[00:26:32.559] I'm like, oh god, I can't yeah for sure
[00:26:32.559] 我当时就想，哦天哪，我肯定不行。
[00:26:35.279] Yeah, especially if it's like if something happens in isolation
[00:26:35.279] 是的，尤其是在孤立事件发生的情况下。
[00:26:38.400] It's fine, but a lot can happen in a week and if like two or three things like pile on each other
[00:26:38.400] 没关系，但一周内可能会发生很多事，如果两三件事叠加在一起就更糟了。
[00:26:43.000] Oh, yeah, yeah, like you feel super pushed down by a kind of.
[00:26:43.000] 哦，是啊，是啊，就像你感觉被某种东西狠狠地压着一样。
[00:26:47.240] But I think I would say maybe like day to day,
[00:26:47.240] 但我认为，或许应该说，就像每天一样，
[00:26:50.960] I'm maybe a little more steady,
[00:26:50.960] 我可能稍微沉稳一些。
[00:26:53.640] but I feel like that's also cause like my day to day
[00:26:53.640] 但我感觉这也是因为我每天都过得很充实。
[00:26:56.160] is very repetitive and normal.
[00:26:56.160] 非常重复且正常。
[00:26:58.960] Honestly, you're so right.
[00:26:58.960] 说实话，你说得太对了。
[00:27:00.079] I didn't think about that, but in a day
[00:27:00.079] 我当时没想过这个问题，但一天之内……
[00:27:02.400] there's like nothing that I consistently.
[00:27:02.400] 我几乎没有什么能一直坚持下去的。
[00:27:04.599] It's like wake up, go to work,
[00:27:04.599] 就像起床、上班一样，
[00:27:07.559] and go home and chill, and then sleep.
[00:27:07.559] 然后回家放松一下，睡觉。
[00:27:09.880] It's like, okay, I can handle this.
[00:27:09.880] 感觉就像，好吧，我可以应付。
[00:27:12.039] I feel like it's kind of a pendulum sometimes,
[00:27:12.039] 我觉得有时候就像钟摆一样，
[00:27:14.839] because I think I relate to both of you.
[00:27:14.839] 因为我觉得我能理解你们两个。
[00:27:16.759] There are so many days where I feel unemotional,
[00:27:16.759] 有很多天我都感觉自己麻木不仁。
[00:27:20.279] but it's kind of like I'm emotionally numb.
[00:27:20.279] 但我感觉自己好像情感麻木了。
[00:27:22.880] It's like almost like I'm choosing not to feel emotions
[00:27:22.880] 感觉就像我选择不去感受任何情绪一样。
[00:27:25.440] because otherwise I would spiral.
[00:27:25.440] 否则我会陷入恶性循环。
[00:27:27.279] And then there are other days where I'm like,
[00:27:27.279] 但也有些时候，我会想：
[00:27:28.599] oh my God, I'm having so much fun.
[00:27:28.599] 我的天哪，我玩得太开心了。
[00:27:30.319] And then like three hours later,
[00:27:30.319] 然后大约三个小时后，
[00:27:31.319] I'm like, I literally hate my life
[00:27:31.319] 我简直恨透了我的生活
[00:27:32.880] and I cannot handle this world.
[00:27:32.880] 我无法承受这个世界。
[00:27:35.000] So for me, I definitely swing,
[00:27:35.000] 所以对我来说，我肯定会挥杆，
[00:27:37.039] but I think to try to get through life,
[00:27:37.039] 但我认为，为了努力度过人生，
[00:27:39.759] sometimes you have to be like numb,
[00:27:39.759] 有时候你必须麻木自己，
[00:27:41.799] not to be all like emo.
[00:27:41.799] 别太像emo风格。
[00:27:43.680] I think to me that's why I value therapy so much.
[00:27:43.680] 我想这就是我如此重视心理治疗的原因。
[00:27:49.559] Cause I just sit there for 50 minutes and I'm like saying so many things.
[00:27:49.559] 因为我坐在那里50分钟，说了好多话。
[00:27:53.799] And it's like sometimes you just sit there and I feel like the emotions come out.
[00:27:53.799] 有时候，你只是坐在那里，感觉各种情绪就自然而然地流露出来。
[00:27:57.000] And later I realize it's not that therapy induced these emotions.
[00:27:57.000] 后来我意识到，并不是治疗引发了这些情绪。
[00:28:01.240] It's more like that's like the only space I could like draw it out.
[00:28:01.240] 更像是只有在那里我才能把它画出来。
[00:28:04.440] So like it's giving you a safe space to release those emotions.
[00:28:04.440] 就像是给你提供了一个安全的空间来释放这些情绪。
[00:28:09.240] Right.
[00:28:09.240] 正确的。
[00:28:10.240] It's like a little bit of like outward processing.
[00:28:10.240] 这有点像向外加工。
[00:28:12.579] Right.
[00:28:12.579] 正确的。
[00:28:13.579] So like I know some people to process their emotions, they'll introspect on it and think
[00:28:13.579] 我知道有些人会通过反思来处理自己的情绪，他们会进行内省和思考。
[00:28:17.160] a lot, but some people kind of need to talk through it.
[00:28:17.160] 很多时候，但有些人需要找人倾诉。
[00:28:19.480] Right.
[00:28:19.480] 正确的。
[00:28:20.480] Their friends and as they're talking through things like they're kind of unpacking their
[00:28:20.480] 他们和朋友们聊天，一边聊着天，一边就像在梳理他们的事情。
[00:28:24.000] own emotions and kind of figuring out how they really feel.
[00:28:24.000] 了解自己的情绪，并弄清楚自己真正的感受。
[00:28:26.400] Would you say then like when you're in therapy every therapy session is an
[00:28:26.400] 那你是不是说，就像你接受治疗时，每一次治疗都是一次……
[00:28:30.799] outburst? Dude I don't know but the last therapy session I had I came out of it
[00:28:30.799] 情绪爆发？兄弟，我不知道，但我上次接受心理治疗后就没事了。
[00:28:35.680] and I was like damn that was like intense. I was like very like heightened emotions
[00:28:35.680] 我当时就想，天哪，那感觉太强烈了。我的情绪非常高涨。
[00:28:41.200] and stuff. A 50-minute outburst. Yeah. I think those are the ones where
[00:28:41.200] 诸如此类。长达50分钟的爆发。是的。我想就是那些时候……
[00:28:45.519] I'm like, this is well worth my money. So I've only been to one therapy session actually.
[00:28:45.519] 我觉得这钱花得太值了。所以实际上我只去过一次心理咨询。
[00:28:52.559] I think I can still answer your question because I feel like in that one session I got everything
[00:28:52.559] 我觉得我还是可以回答你的问题，因为我觉得在那一次咨询中我已经了解了所有内容。
[00:28:56.960] out that I needed to. Oh my god. And then part of it was that I feel like I didn't really click
[00:28:56.960] 我需要这么做。我的天哪。还有一部分原因是，我觉得我好像没真正融入进去。
[00:29:01.519] with my therapist but the other part I was just like, I think I said why I need to say that.
[00:29:01.519] 和我的治疗师谈了这件事，但另一部分我却想，我想我已经说过我为什么需要说这些了。
[00:29:05.920] I actually feel a lot better.
[00:29:05.920] 我感觉好多了。
[00:29:07.079] Like.
[00:29:07.079] 喜欢。
[00:29:07.920] Brian just needs a one session a year.
[00:29:07.920] 布莱恩每年只需要一次治疗。
[00:29:10.400] Oh, wait.
[00:29:10.400] 哦，等等。
[00:29:11.880] One's a lifetime.
[00:29:11.880] 一生只有一次。
[00:29:13.160] He's like, yo, so guess what happened
[00:29:13.160] 他就像在说，哟，猜猜发生了什么事
[00:29:14.880] in the past 50 years of my life?
[00:29:14.880] 在我过去50年的生命中？
[00:29:17.839] So when I was five.
[00:29:17.839] 我五岁的时候。
[00:29:20.359] I think the other thing too about therapy
[00:29:20.359] 我觉得治疗还有另一点需要注意。
[00:29:22.519] is the hard thing about emotions for me
[00:29:22.519] 对我来说，情感最难的地方就在于此。
[00:29:24.599] is I always feel them, right?
[00:29:24.599] 我总是能感觉到它们，对吗？
[00:29:26.079] They're like bubbling under the surface
[00:29:26.079] 它们就像在水面下冒泡一样。
[00:29:27.720] Mm-hmm
[00:29:27.720] 嗯
[00:29:28.200] But I have no way to know if it's valid or not and I'm like constantly doubting of like am I being dramatic or like am I being crazy?
[00:29:28.200] 但我无法知道它是否有效，我总是怀疑自己是不是太夸张了，或者是不是疯了？
[00:29:34.599] Or is this like a very normal and human experience? Mm-hmm often times I'm like
[00:29:34.599] 或者这只是非常正常的人性体验？嗯，很多时候我都是这样。
[00:29:39.119] Bouncing this off of James which I've mentioned on this before, that's like not the best idea in the world.
[00:29:39.119] 之前我提到过，把这件事告诉詹姆斯，这并不是个好主意。
[00:29:45.759] But because I have therapy,
[00:29:45.759] 但因为我接受了心理治疗，
[00:29:47.420] I feel like this external person is really able to either
[00:29:47.420] 我觉得这个外来者确实有能力做到以下两点：
[00:29:50.079] validate that or like check me on stuff
[00:29:50.079] 确认一下，或者帮我检查一下。
[00:29:52.240] that I may be overreacting on.
[00:29:52.240] 也许我反应过度了。
[00:29:55.000] So then that kind of process helps a lot.
[00:29:55.000] 所以，这种方法很有帮助。
[00:29:58.160] Like they help you regulate your emotions.
[00:29:58.160] 比如它们可以帮助你调节情绪。
[00:30:00.640] Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:00.640] 是啊是啊。
[00:30:01.759] Which is kind of funny
[00:30:01.759] 这有点滑稽。
[00:30:02.599] because there's no like real objectivity in the world,
[00:30:02.599] 因为世界上根本不存在真正的客观性。
[00:30:06.400] you know, like everything is so subjective, everything is so personal. So it's not like this one person
[00:30:06.400] 你知道，一切都太主观了，一切都太个人化了。所以，这并不是某个人就能说的。
[00:30:11.519] can be like, yes, you're right or no, you're wrong. But it still kind of feels like that sometimes.
[00:30:11.519] 可以是“是的，你是对的”或者“不，你是错的”。但有时候感觉还是有点像那样。
[00:30:16.880] You're like, am I being a normal human right now? And they're like, don't worry, you're good.
[00:30:16.880] 你会想，我现在这样正常吗？他们会说，别担心，你很好。
[00:30:20.400] Do I always ask that? I'm always like, is this normal? Is this normal? My therapist is like,
[00:30:20.400] 我总是问这个问题吗？我总是问，这正常吗？这正常吗？我的治疗师会说，
[00:30:24.480] okay, you need to let go of the idea that something is normal.
[00:30:24.480] 好吧，你需要放弃“这是正常的”这种想法。
[00:30:28.400] I do feel like a lot of times I do feel better
[00:30:28.400] 很多时候，我的确感觉好多了。
[00:30:30.519] when someone validates your emotions
[00:30:30.519] 当有人认可你的情绪时
[00:30:32.279] or like acknowledges how you feel.
[00:30:32.279] 或者说，它承认了你的感受。
[00:30:34.640] And I feel like I do that thing too,
[00:30:34.640] 我觉得我也会做那样的事。
[00:30:36.359] where you tend to invalidate your own emotions.
[00:30:36.359] 你往往会否定自己的情绪。
[00:30:40.240] But then I feel like that contributes to the,
[00:30:40.240] 但我觉得这反而促成了……
[00:30:42.960] it's kind of like the cycle where you'll repress your own emotions
[00:30:42.960] 这有点像你会压抑自己情绪的恶性循环
[00:30:45.720] and because of that, like the next time it comes around again,
[00:30:45.720] 正因如此，就像下次它再次发生时一样，
[00:30:48.440] you feel like a little bit worse about it than you did the last time.
[00:30:48.440] 你感觉这次比上次更糟一些。
[00:30:51.400] Yeah, right.
[00:30:51.400] 是啊，没错。
[00:30:52.160] The ball of emotion grows bigger each time.
[00:30:52.160] 情绪的球体一次比一次大。
[00:30:55.079] Also, I do think that the valid date,
[00:30:55.079] 另外，我认为有效日期，
[00:30:57.319] shin stuff is maybe like super common
[00:30:57.319] 胫骨相关的东西可能非常常见
[00:31:00.400] because I feel like whenever people share stories
[00:31:00.400] 因为我觉得每当人们分享故事的时候……
[00:31:03.400] and they're like, oh my God, this is like so dramatic but blah, blah, blah, blah, then everyone at the table is like, oh my God, I feel like whenever people share stories and they're like, oh my God, this is so dramatic,
[00:31:03.400] 然后他们就会说，哦我的天哪，这太戏剧化了，但是等等等等，然后桌上的每个人都会说，哦我的天哪，我觉得每当人们分享故事时，他们都会说，哦我的天哪，这太戏剧化了，
[00:31:05.480] but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:31:05.480] 但是，等等等等，
[00:31:06.640] then everyone at the table is like,
[00:31:06.640] 然后桌上的每个人都会说：
[00:31:08.079] oh my God, I feel the same way.
[00:31:08.079] 我的天哪，我也有同感。
[00:31:09.680] Like that totally happened to me too.
[00:31:09.680] 我也完全经历过这种事。
[00:31:11.400] And then it's like, oh shit,
[00:31:11.400] 然后就感觉，糟了，
[00:31:12.519] like everyone's experiencing this,
[00:31:12.519] 就像每个人都在经历这一切一样，
[00:31:14.500] but maybe we just don't talk out loud about it as much.
[00:31:14.500] 但也许我们只是不太愿意公开谈论这件事。
[00:31:17.180] So then we're all in our heads wondering,
[00:31:17.180] 所以，我们所有人都在心里琢磨着：
[00:31:18.920] like am I normal?
[00:31:18.920] 我正常吗？
[00:31:19.940] Is everyone else feeling this way too?
[00:31:19.940] 其他人也有这种感觉吗？
[00:31:22.000] Like just me or?
[00:31:22.000] 只有我一个人这样吗？
[00:31:23.440] It's true.
[00:31:23.440] 没错。
[00:31:24.519] I guess part of that too is, I think it's a little bit uncomfortable to acknowledge negative
[00:31:24.519] 我想部分原因也在于，承认负面因素会让人有点不自在。
[00:31:28.680] feelings sometimes.
[00:31:28.680] 有时会有感觉。
[00:31:29.680] Like sometimes I feel like by validating myself of like, oh yeah, I'm right to be angry.
[00:31:29.680] 有时候我觉得，通过自我肯定，比如“哦，是的，我生气是对的”，就能证明自己的愤怒是对的。
[00:31:34.160] Thereby saying my life is bad or like I'm in a bad situation when the natural thing
[00:31:34.160] 也就是说，我的生活很糟糕，或者我处境很差，而实际上，这很正常。
[00:31:38.799] in life is to want to be happy and want to be in a good situation.
[00:31:38.799] 人生就是想要快乐，想要拥有美好的生活。
[00:31:42.119] So sometimes I don't want to like acknowledge my
[00:31:42.119] 所以有时候我不想承认我的
[00:31:45.200] misfortunes in a sense.
[00:31:45.200] 从某种意义上说，这是不幸的事。
[00:31:47.759] Yeah, I do think that negative emotions like feel a lot more
[00:31:47.759] 是的，我确实认为负面情绪会让人感觉更强烈。
[00:31:52.440] weighted than happy emotions.
[00:31:52.440] 比快乐情绪更沉重。
[00:31:54.960] I wish it wasn't like that, but at least for me, I feel like I
[00:31:54.960] 我希望事情不是这样，但至少对我来说，我觉得……
[00:31:57.759] focus on the more pessimistic stuff to be honest.
[00:31:57.759] 说实话，我更关注那些比较悲观的事情。
[00:32:01.599] Yeah, I guess when I'm feeling sad or upset or whatever,
[00:32:01.599] 是的，我想当我感到悲伤、沮丧或其他什么情绪的时候，
[00:32:07.039] my thought is like, why?
[00:32:07.039] 我的想法是，为什么？
[00:32:08.559] Why, what's going on?
[00:32:08.559] 怎么回事？
[00:32:10.240] And then I'm like investigating, but if I were happy,
[00:32:10.240] 然后我就像是去调查一样，但如果我感到快乐的话，
[00:32:12.359] I'd just be like, oh yeah, I know I'm happy.
[00:32:12.359] 我当时就会想，哦，是的，我知道我很开心。
[00:32:14.400] Like whatever, moving on, right?
[00:32:14.400] 算了，继续前进吧？
[00:32:16.359] Damn, it's like life is so simple when you're happy.
[00:32:16.359] 唉，快乐的时候生活真是简单。
[00:32:18.799] Yeah, that's so complicated when you're not.
[00:32:18.799] 是啊，如果你不是那样的人，那就太复杂了。
[00:32:20.920] I know.
[00:32:20.920] 我知道。
[00:32:21.920] Yeah, actually I do also feel that way where like if you talk about something it doesn't
[00:32:21.920] 是的，其实我也有这种感觉，就是如果你谈论某件事，它就……
[00:32:26.640] make it feel more real sometimes.
[00:32:26.640] 有时这样会感觉更真实。
[00:32:28.759] Have you guys ever experienced a feeling where you open up to someone?
[00:32:28.759] 你们有没有过那种想要向某人敞开心扉的感觉？
[00:32:32.000] Maybe you don't know that well.
[00:32:32.000] 或许你不太了解。
[00:32:33.279] And then afterwards you're just like, I think I said too much about myself or.
[00:32:33.279] 然后事后你就会想，我觉得我好像说了太多关于我自己的事。
[00:32:36.920] Oh my god.
[00:32:36.920] 我的天啊。
[00:32:37.920] Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:37.920] 是的，我也这么认为。
[00:32:38.920] Yeah.
[00:32:38.920] 是的。
[00:32:39.920] I experienced this a lot.
[00:32:39.920] 我经常遇到这种情况。
[00:32:40.920] I feel like when I moved to a new city, I'm like, my friends there really, they're like pretty open.
[00:32:40.920] 我觉得当我搬到一个新的城市时，我的朋友们都挺开明的。
[00:32:47.839] And like, I actually got a lot better
[00:32:47.839] 而且，我的状况实际上好多了。
[00:32:49.279] about talking about like, really personal stuff with them.
[00:32:49.279] 和他们谈论一些非常私人的事情。
[00:32:51.920] But because I hadn't been friends with them for that long,
[00:32:51.920] 但因为我和他们认识的时间并不长，
[00:32:54.000] or I didn't know how close we were yet,
[00:32:54.000] 或者我当时还不知道我们离得有多近。
[00:32:56.000] a lot of times when I talked about like,
[00:32:56.000] 很多时候，当我谈到类似的事情时，
[00:32:57.359] the more personal or like,
[00:32:57.359] 越个人化或越像，
[00:32:59.599] negative feelings afterwards, I'd go home like,
[00:32:59.599] 事后产生负面情绪，我就会像这样回家：
[00:33:01.539] dude, they probably think I'm so fucking good.
[00:33:01.539] 老兄，他们可能觉得我牛逼得不行。
[00:33:03.839] I'm like.
[00:33:03.839] 我当时就想。
[00:33:08.940] Do it scary. I feel like it's really scary to put yourself out there like that. And then sometimes in the moment, you're like, oh fuck, I already started.
[00:33:08.940] 去做那些让你感到害怕的事情。我觉得把自己完全暴露在公众视野中真的很可怕。有时候，到了那个时候，你会想，哦，天哪，我已经开始了。
[00:33:12.220] Like it's just not gonna stop. We're in this now.
[00:33:12.220] 好像这一切根本停不下来。我们现在身处其中。
[00:33:15.700] We're in the floodgates.
[00:33:15.700] 我们已经进入了洪水期。
[00:33:16.740] I think there is a bit of power to like being able to acknowledge these things
[00:33:16.740] 我认为能够承认这些事情本身就具有一定的力量。
[00:33:21.779] and openly talk about it though. For me, I feel like because it's hard for me to one, personally acknowledge that there
[00:33:21.779] 但要公开谈论这件事却很难。对我来说，我觉得因为首先，我个人很难承认这一点。
[00:33:28.720] are things in my life that maybe I'm not super happy about.
[00:33:28.720] 生活中有些事情我可能不太满意。
[00:33:31.240] And then two, being able to talk about that with other people is really hard for me.
[00:33:31.240] 其次，要和别人谈论这件事对我来说真的很难。
[00:33:34.440] So then I feel like I'm constantly navigating between the numbness and the outbursts, which
[00:33:34.440] 所以，我觉得自己一直在麻木和情绪爆发之间摇摆不定。
[00:33:38.160] is like not the best place to be in.
[00:33:38.160] 这里似乎不是个好去处。
[00:33:41.319] So when you feel the numbness, you just put your mind off of it?
[00:33:41.319] 所以当你感到麻木的时候，你就不去想它？
[00:33:45.000] Yeah, I think I try to distract myself with stuff.
[00:33:45.000] 是的，我想我会用其他事情分散自己的注意力。
[00:33:49.000] For example, like, binging TV shows or getting really into something
[00:33:49.000] 例如，比如，疯狂追剧或者特别沉迷于某件事。
[00:33:53.000] so that I feel like I don't have time to acknowledge things
[00:33:53.000] 以至于我觉得我没有时间去关注这些事情。
[00:33:56.000] for you out of my life.
[00:33:56.000] 把你从我的生活中彻底抹去。
[00:33:57.000] Oh my god, dude, I saw some memes related to that
[00:33:57.000] 我的天啊，老兄，我看到了一些相关的梗图。
[00:34:01.000] where, you know how there's a lot of like really intense fans stands as we call them
[00:34:01.000] 你知道，那里有很多我们称之为“狂热球迷看台”的地方。
[00:34:06.000] I've seen a lot of like screenshots of tweets from these people where it's like oh my god
[00:34:06.000] 我见过很多这些人发的推文截图，简直让人无语。
[00:34:10.880] I went to therapy and I found out I'm just depressed so I'm like no longer obsessive about these people anymore like oh
[00:34:10.880] 我去做了心理治疗，发现我只是得了抑郁症，所以我现在不再像以前那样执着于这些人了，哦
[00:34:16.880] I'm on like medication now I'm good and I think one of the funny ones I saw was like there's like this whole group of people who
[00:34:16.880] 我现在吃药了，感觉好多了。我看到一个挺搞笑的，好像是说有一群人……
[00:34:22.599] I think one of the funny ones I saw was like, there's like this whole group of people
[00:34:22.599] 我觉得我看到的一个挺搞笑的，就是有这么一大群人
[00:34:24.039] who really wanna prove that Taylor Swift is bi or gay
[00:34:24.039] 谁真的想证明泰勒·斯威夫特是双性恋或同性恋？
[00:34:28.159] or something.
[00:34:28.159] 或者别的什么。
[00:34:29.079] So gay, learn Swift.
[00:34:29.079] 太gay了，学Swift吧。
[00:34:30.360] Yeah.
[00:34:30.360] 是的。
[00:34:31.599] So one of the tweets I saw was like,
[00:34:31.599] 我看到的一条推文是这样的：
[00:34:33.880] oh my God, I found out I was depressed
[00:34:33.880] 我的天哪，我发现自己得了抑郁症
[00:34:35.719] so now I'm in therapy and now I'm doing so much better.
[00:34:35.719] 所以我现在正在接受治疗，现在好多了。
[00:34:38.360] I don't care if Taylor Swift is gay or not,
[00:34:38.360] 我不在乎泰勒·斯威夫特是不是同性恋。
[00:34:40.320] but I still think she is, but I don't care.
[00:34:40.320] 但我仍然认为她是，不过我不在乎。
[00:34:42.400] I don't care.
[00:34:42.400] 我不在乎。
[00:34:43.239] If you ask me. I still have. Like my answer is still yes but like I don't care. If you ask me.
[00:34:43.239] 如果你问我，我还是会说“是”，但我不在乎。如果你问我的话。
[00:34:47.800] Like my answer is still yes, but like I don't give a shit.
[00:34:47.800] 我的答案依然是“是”，但我根本不在乎。
[00:34:50.960] So I thought that was so funny.
[00:34:50.960] 我觉得这太搞笑了。
[00:34:52.880] And it's kind of true, right?
[00:34:52.880] 这话也有点道理，对吧？
[00:34:54.119] Like you're saying maybe one of our first reactions is we want to distract ourselves
[00:34:54.119] 就像你说的，我们最初的反应之一可能就是想让自己分心。
[00:34:58.880] with something that we can get like really obsessive over so that we don't have to like
[00:34:58.880] 我们可能会对某些东西非常着迷，这样我们就不必喜欢它了。
[00:35:02.760] deal with our emotions.
[00:35:02.760] 处理好我们的情绪。
[00:35:04.159] Yeah, it's kind of like rocking a hard place.
[00:35:04.159] 是啊，这有点像进退两难。
[00:35:06.480] It's like, do I wanna feel bad emotions every day?
[00:35:06.480] 我感觉自己好像每天都想感受负面情绪一样？
[00:35:09.400] Not crazy bad, but to an extent,
[00:35:09.400] 不算特别糟糕，但某种程度上来说，
[00:35:11.719] do I wanna feel this every day?
[00:35:11.719] 我真的想每天都这样吗？
[00:35:13.079] Or should I just be numb forever?
[00:35:13.079] 还是我应该永远麻木下去？
[00:35:15.760] I see.
[00:35:15.760] 我懂了。
[00:35:16.599] I mean, I'm making this sound very dramatic.
[00:35:16.599] 我的意思是，我把事情说得好像很严重似的。
[00:35:19.320] I don't think my swings are that crazy,
[00:35:19.320] 我不认为我的挥杆动作有那么夸张。
[00:35:22.360] but I think this is hopefully relatable to people.
[00:35:22.360] 但我认为这或许能引起大家的共鸣。
[00:35:25.639] It's just like, sometimes I just don't wanna be sad.
[00:35:25.639] 有时候，我就是不想难过。
[00:35:28.400] Yeah.
[00:35:28.400] 是的。
[00:35:29.239] Okay, but also on the flip side,
[00:35:29.239] 好的，但另一方面，
[00:35:30.760] do you ever have like happy outbursts?
[00:35:30.760] 你有没有过那种突然高兴起来、情绪爆发的时候？
[00:35:33.199] No, just kidding.
[00:35:33.199] 不，开玩笑的。
[00:35:34.800] But I think probably.
[00:35:34.800] 但我认为很有可能。
[00:35:38.519] I think definitely, but I can't think of anything right now.
[00:35:38.519] 我觉得肯定有，但我现在想不出什么具体的例子。
[00:35:42.760] It's been a long 20.
[00:35:42.760] 这二十年过得很漫长。
[00:35:44.239] Oh my God, actually, I definitely do get them.
[00:35:44.239] 我的天哪，实际上，我确实有这种感觉。
[00:35:48.599] So I'm like a socially anxious extrovert.
[00:35:48.599] 所以我就像是那种有社交焦虑的外向型人格。
[00:35:51.480] So I feel like I get really, really happy
[00:35:51.480] 所以我觉得我真的非常非常开心
[00:35:53.079] when I'm surrounded by friends and like people I love.
[00:35:53.079] 当我被朋友和自己爱的人围绕时。
[00:35:56.000] That was the same case for me during my childhood too, right?
[00:35:56.000] 我小时候也是这样，对吧？
[00:35:58.880] So I have this distinct memory where I went to go watch
[00:35:58.880] 我清楚地记得，我当时是去看……
[00:36:02.239] some sort of movie with like my church friends
[00:36:02.239] 和我的教会朋友们一起看电影。
[00:36:04.440] and like their parents. So we were all like standing outside the theater and I was
[00:36:04.440] 就像他们的父母一样。所以我们都站在剧院外面，而我
[00:36:07.519] so happy. Like I was like high on the happiness of like friendship and we were
[00:36:07.519] 太开心了。感觉自己像沉浸在友谊的幸福之中，我们当时
[00:36:11.880] running around outside the theater screaming. Like you know how kids just
[00:36:11.880] 在剧院外面跑来跑去，尖叫着。就像你知道的，孩子们就是这样。
[00:36:15.159] screamed they're so happy. So we were screaming and my dad like grabbed my hand
[00:36:15.159] 他们高兴得尖叫起来。我们也跟着尖叫，然后我爸爸抓住了我的手。
[00:36:18.480] he was like don't outburst in public. Like you need to regulate your emotions.
[00:36:18.480] 他当时说，别在公共场合情绪失控。你需要控制自己的情绪。
[00:36:22.920] Like in Korean it's like to DigiMife, like that's kind of what the translation is,
[00:36:22.920] 就像韩语里的“DigiMife”一样，翻译大概就是这个意思。
[00:36:26.139] like don't be so light and like don't be so crazy basically.
[00:36:26.139] 别那么轻浮，也别那么疯狂，总之就是这样。
[00:36:31.519] I like always think about that actually.
[00:36:31.519] 我其实总是会思考这个问题。
[00:36:33.519] I'm always like, okay, I need to like not be so
[00:36:33.519] 我总是想，好吧，我需要别那么……
[00:36:36.760] up in the air in like my happiness.
[00:36:36.760] 我的幸福就像晴天霹雳一样，飘忽不定。
[00:36:40.039] Do so maybe the solution is we all need to not hold back
[00:36:40.039] 这样做或许就能解决问题，那就是我们都需要放下顾虑。
[00:36:43.920] our happy outburst, but we should hold back our sad outburst.
[00:36:43.920] 我们应该克制高兴的情绪，但要克制悲伤的情绪。
[00:36:47.519] Should we scream out of play?
[00:36:47.519] 我们应该大声喊出游戏规则吗？
[00:36:49.440] I don't know.
[00:36:49.440] 我不知道。
[00:36:51.400] When I think of happy outburst, maybe it's just
[00:36:51.400] 当我想到快乐爆发时，也许只是
[00:36:53.619] bursting out into a fit of laughter with friends
[00:36:53.619] 和朋友们一起放声大笑
[00:36:56.800] when you can't hold it in anymore.
[00:36:56.800] 当你再也无法抑制的时候。
[00:36:58.639] Maybe that's one of the most basic versions.
[00:36:58.639] 这或许是最基本的版本之一。
[00:37:00.800] Yeah, I feel like definitely being surrounded by friends
[00:37:00.800] 是的，我感觉自己肯定是被朋友们围绕着。
[00:37:03.800] does give me that like burst of
[00:37:03.800] 确实给我那种爆发感
[00:37:05.239] joy.
[00:37:05.239] 喜悦。
[00:37:06.239] Mm hmm.
[00:37:06.239] 嗯。
[00:37:07.239] On the topic of happy outbursts, we kind of talked about how negative emotions can sometimes
[00:37:07.239] 关于喜极而泣这个话题，我们也谈到了负面情绪有时是如何引发喜极而泣的。
[00:37:11.440] feel more weighted.
[00:37:11.440] 感觉更重了。
[00:37:12.639] Right.
[00:37:12.639] 正确的。
[00:37:13.639] Do you think the long term impact of a happy outburst is different from like the long term
[00:37:13.639] 你认为一次快乐爆发的长期影响与长期影响有何不同？
[00:37:18.960] impact of a sad outburst or a mad outburst?
[00:37:18.960] 悲伤的情绪爆发或愤怒的情绪爆发会造成什么影响？
[00:37:22.239] Actually yes.
[00:37:22.239] 确实如此。
[00:37:23.239] Because like Brian mentioned towards the beginning of the episode,
[00:37:23.239] 正如布莱恩在本集开头提到的那样，
[00:37:26.019] like sometimes you have an outburst and you think about it later, right?
[00:37:26.019] 就像有时候你会情绪爆发，然后事后再去思考这件事，对吧？
[00:37:29.119] You're like, oh, should I have done that?
[00:37:29.119] 你会想，哦，我当时应该那样做吗？
[00:37:31.699] You know, like 10 years later we're up in the middle of the night.
[00:37:31.699] 你知道吗，就像10年后，我们半夜醒来。
[00:37:35.500] Like, oh my gosh, I said that one.
[00:37:35.500] 天哪，我居然说过那样的话。
[00:37:37.000] I was like 12 years old.
[00:37:37.000] 我当时大概12岁。
[00:37:39.820] But like, happy outburst is kind of like, okay, that happened.
[00:37:39.820] 但是，高兴的爆发就像是，好吧，这件事发生了。
[00:37:43.139] Like we can't even think of happy out first we had.
[00:37:43.139] 我们甚至都想不起我们第一次拥有的快乐。
[00:37:45.500] For sure.
[00:37:45.500] 一定。
[00:37:46.500] Oh, that's so true.
[00:37:46.500] 哦，说得太对了。
[00:37:47.500] Yeah.
[00:37:47.500] 是的。
[00:37:48.000] I guess because happiness isn't something you have to resolve.
[00:37:48.000] 我想是因为幸福并不是你需要解决的问题。
[00:37:50.699] Like, I feel like negative emotions always feels like there needs to be a solution or like some sort of way out.
[00:37:50.699] 我总觉得负面情绪需要找到解决办法或者某种出路。
[00:37:55.500] But happiness is like, it's fine.
[00:37:55.500] 但幸福的感觉就像是，一切都很好。
[00:37:56.900] It's just like, it's already solved.
[00:37:56.900] 就好像，问题已经解决了一样。
[00:37:59.000] Yeah.
[00:37:59.000] 是的。
[00:37:59.500] It's like a passive.
[00:37:59.500] 它就像一个被动技能。
[00:38:00.500] Yeah.
[00:38:00.500] 是的。
[00:38:01.300] I feel like angry or like frustration out first when you think of that event or like the whole day,
[00:38:01.300] 每当想起那件事或者想起那一整天，我首先感到的是愤怒或沮丧。
[00:38:06.679] that's like the first thing you think of. But for happy
[00:38:06.679] 那就像你首先想到的。但为了快乐
[00:38:09.119] uppers, I feel like I can't think of any right now because I
[00:38:09.119] 兴奋剂方面，我现在一时想不出什么好东西，因为我
[00:38:12.079] just remember that general like period of time where like I
[00:38:12.079] 记住那段时间，就像我
[00:38:14.320] felt very happy or like that memory. And then there was
[00:38:14.320] 感觉非常开心，或者说很喜欢那段回忆。然后就有了……
[00:38:18.119] probably like a happy uppers in there. But I'm just kind of
[00:38:18.119] 里面可能像装了兴奋剂一样让人心情愉悦。但我只是有点……
[00:38:20.280] remembering like how I fell in the moment rather than like some
[00:38:20.280] 记得我当时是如何坠入爱河的，而不是像某些人那样。
[00:38:23.280] cringy thing.
[00:38:23.280] 真尴尬。
[00:38:25.559] I feel like for me happy outbursts feel a lot more physical.
[00:38:25.559] 我觉得对我来说，快乐的爆发感更多地体现在身体层面。
[00:38:29.280] I can actually feel the rush of my heart if I try to recall a happy outbursts.
[00:38:29.280] 如果我试着回忆起快乐爆发的时刻，我甚至能感觉到自己心跳加速。
[00:38:33.380] It's the kind of feeling that makes you want to skip outside.
[00:38:33.380] 这种感觉会让你忍不住想蹦蹦跳跳地跑出去。
[00:38:37.159] I feel it a lot like the first day of traveling or the first day of a friendship.
[00:38:37.159] 我觉得这很像旅行的第一天或者友谊的第一天。
[00:38:40.880] I'm like, oh my god, my heart is swelling.
[00:38:40.880] 我当时就想，我的天哪，我的心都快要跳出来了。
[00:38:42.800] Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:42.800] 是啊是啊。
[00:38:44.000] That's a good one. The first day of travel is pretty exciting.
[00:38:44.000] 这真是个好主意。旅行的第一天总是令人兴奋。
[00:38:47.280] But then if you're put on the spot,
[00:38:47.280] 但如果你被逼到墙角，
[00:38:48.719] like, yo, tell me when was your last happy outburst?
[00:38:48.719] 嘿，告诉我，你上次开心大笑是什么时候？
[00:38:51.559] You're like, cool.
[00:38:51.559] 你真酷。
[00:38:52.400] You feel like when I was a kid,
[00:38:52.400] 感觉就像回到了小时候，
[00:38:53.239] my dad told me to stop.
[00:38:53.239] 我爸爸让我停下来。
[00:38:54.559] Oh, yeah.
[00:38:54.559] 哦，是的。
[00:38:55.559] But the first and last happy outburst.
[00:38:55.559] 但这是第一次也是最后一次的快乐爆发。
[00:38:59.320] Oh my god.
[00:38:59.320] 我的天啊。
[00:39:03.440] Well, one thing that someone said to me was that another reason why negative emotions feel
[00:39:03.440] 有人跟我说过，负面情绪的另一个原因是……
[00:39:09.340] so much more weighted now is because our frontal lobes are developed.
[00:39:09.340] 现在感觉身体更重是因为我们的前额叶发育成熟了。
[00:39:14.719] She was like, yeah, you now can weigh pros and cons and you can like see farther the
[00:39:14.719] 她当时说，是啊，现在你可以权衡利弊，看得更远了。
[00:39:21.480] results of each choice.
[00:39:21.480] 每个选择的结果。
[00:39:23.960] So that's why there's more stress in your life.
[00:39:23.960] 所以这就是你生活压力更大的原因。
[00:39:27.199] And I was like, can I ungrow it?
[00:39:27.199] 我当时就想，我能把它变回去吗？
[00:39:30.199] Yeah.
[00:39:30.199] 是的。
[00:39:31.199] How do I reduce it?
[00:39:31.199] 我该如何减少它？
[00:39:36.440] Yeah, I mean, definitely, I think emotions in our late 20s
[00:39:36.440] 是的，我的意思是，当然，我认为我们20多岁后期的情绪……
[00:39:40.519] feel a lot different than emotions when we were younger.
[00:39:40.519] 感觉和我们小时候的情绪大不相同了。
[00:39:43.719] I guess the positive is that it doesn't feel as intense anymore.
[00:39:43.719] 我想好的一面是，感觉没那么强烈了。
[00:39:46.800] I think if I recall my high school era,
[00:39:46.800] 我想如果我回忆起我的高中时代，
[00:39:49.400] everything felt like such high stakes,
[00:39:49.400] 一切都感觉像是生死攸关的大事，
[00:39:51.280] even though looking back, it kind of wasn't really.
[00:39:51.280] 虽然现在回想起来，其实并非如此。
[00:39:53.880] Nowadays, the decisions we're making on a day-to-day basis
[00:39:53.880] 如今，我们每天所做的决定
[00:39:57.239] are bigger in size, but I feel like less crazy emotional about it.
[00:39:57.239] 虽然尺寸更大，但我感觉自己没有那么激动了。
[00:40:02.320] So that I'm grateful for.
[00:40:02.320] 所以我对此心存感激。
[00:40:03.880] I think in another sense, it can sort of feel like life is duller.
[00:40:03.880] 我觉得从另一个角度来看，生活可能会感觉变得更乏味了。
[00:40:08.519] So then to feel emotions, again, you have to do things like watch a sad TV show or like go on a vacation.
[00:40:08.519] 所以，要想再次感受到情感，你必须做一些事情，比如看悲伤的电视节目或者去度假。
[00:40:13.679] So you're like inducing it sort of more intensely.
[00:40:13.679] 所以你实际上是在更强烈地诱发它。
[00:40:17.559] I guess it's because like our emotions are more nuanced now.
[00:40:17.559] 我想是因为我们现在的情感更加微妙了。
[00:40:20.599] And then we've also experienced more.
[00:40:20.599] 而且，我们还经历了更多。
[00:40:23.239] So we recognize it a little faster but then like a lot
[00:40:23.239] 所以我们能更快地识别出来，但之后就非常喜欢了。
[00:40:26.639] of it happens so it's like a lot of small things versus like when we're kids like one thing is the
[00:40:26.639] 如果这种情况发生，就像很多小事一样，和我们小时候发生的一件事截然不同。
[00:40:33.119] world you're like oh my god this person took my toy like it's the end of the world.
[00:40:33.119] 你会觉得，天哪，这个人拿走了我的玩具，好像世界末日来临了一样。
[00:40:40.159] I kind of missed that feeling like there's something about being a teenager listening to like, I don't know, punk rock.
[00:40:40.159] 我有点怀念那种感觉，就像十几岁时听朋克摇滚之类的音乐一样。
[00:40:45.960] Because I have a co-roak.
[00:40:45.960] 因为我有一个共同的roak。
[00:40:46.960] Yeah.
[00:40:46.960] 是的。
[00:40:47.960] And feeling that feeling of it's me against the world.
[00:40:47.960] 感觉自己孤立无援，与全世界为敌。
[00:40:51.000] Like I feel like there's no such high like that.
[00:40:51.000] 我觉得世上再也找不到像那样令人兴奋的东西了。
[00:40:54.079] For sure.
[00:40:54.079] 一定。
[00:40:54.920] I think life was a lot simpler back then.
[00:40:54.920] 我觉得那时候的生活要简单得多。
[00:40:56.199] So when you like reflect on it, it seems a little bit silly
[00:40:56.199] 所以当你仔细想想，这似乎有点傻。
[00:40:59.480] almost how hard you reacted to things.
[00:40:59.480] 几乎就是你对事情反应的强烈程度。
[00:41:01.440] And now I think there's objectively a lot more pressure
[00:41:01.440] 现在我觉得客观上压力确实大了很多。
[00:41:03.880] like in your late 20s,
[00:41:03.880] 就像你快30岁的时候一样，
[00:41:05.639] than there probably was when you were in middle school.
[00:41:05.639] 可能比你上中学时的情况要好得多。
[00:41:08.519] So you kind of missed like the simplicity
[00:41:08.519] 所以你有点错过了那种简洁之美。
[00:41:10.239] and how much easier things were back then.
[00:41:10.239] 那时候的生活是多么轻松啊。
[00:41:12.880] Yeah.
[00:41:12.880] 是的。
[00:41:13.719] Dude, like imagine your 10 year old self
[00:41:13.719] 老兄，想象一下你10岁时的自己
[00:41:16.320] living the life you live right now.
[00:41:16.320] 过你现在的生活。
[00:41:18.119] Oh my God.
[00:41:18.119] 我的天啊。
[00:41:19.519] Like what they have.
[00:41:19.519] 喜欢他们所拥有的。
[00:41:20.360] Crumble.
[00:41:20.360] 崩溃。
[00:41:21.199] Like breakdowns every other, every 30 minutes.
[00:41:21.199] 就像每隔一两次，每30分钟就会发生一次故障。
[00:41:25.320] I think to an extent now,
[00:41:25.320] 我认为在某种程度上，
[00:41:28.239] I almost feel like the lack of stress
[00:41:28.239] 我几乎感觉不到压力了。
[00:41:30.559] is also an emotion for me.
[00:41:30.559] 对我来说，这也是一种情感。
[00:41:33.079] It's like if you feel work stress every single day,
[00:41:33.079] 就像你每天都感到工作压力一样，
[00:41:35.400] then sometimes I'm grateful for weekends,
[00:41:35.400] 有时我会很感激周末的到来。
[00:41:37.159] not because I'm gonna be extremely happy and ecstatic
[00:41:37.159] 并非因为我会感到无比快乐和欣喜若狂
[00:41:39.599] on the weekend, but just because I will be less stressed.
[00:41:39.599] 周末去，只是因为那样我会压力小一些。
[00:41:42.719] Turn off your brain kind of like, just relax.
[00:41:42.719] 关掉你的大脑，放松一下。
[00:41:45.280] Agreed.
[00:41:45.280] 同意。
[00:41:46.159] So maybe we have a gotten better at emotional regulation,
[00:41:46.159] 所以或许我们在情绪调节方面变得更好了。
[00:41:49.360] but since it's so incremental, we don't realize it.
[00:41:49.360] 但由于这种变化是渐进的，所以我们意识不到。
[00:41:52.079] Until now we're reflecting back, we're like,
[00:41:52.079] 直到现在我们回顾过去，我们都会这样想：
[00:41:54.079] oh yeah, this one thing was the end of the world
[00:41:54.079] 哦，对，这件事就是世界末日。
[00:41:56.719] when I was 10 years old,
[00:41:56.719] 我10岁的时候，
[00:41:58.239] but now it's such a brush off thing.
[00:41:58.239] 但现在却被轻描淡写地一带而过。
[00:42:01.920] Do you think you have measures that maybe you didn't even
[00:42:01.920] 你认为你有一些措施，而你可能根本没有考虑过。
[00:42:06.800] realize that you used to prevent outbursts,
[00:42:06.800] 意识到你过去是如何控制情绪爆发的，
[00:42:10.280] whether it be happy or sad?
[00:42:10.280] 是高兴还是悲伤？
[00:42:12.480] I think I mentioned therapy earlier,
[00:42:12.480] 我想我之前提到过心理治疗。
[00:42:14.920] so that's probably like the biggest way
[00:42:14.920] 所以这大概是最大的途径了。
[00:42:16.920] I've been trying to manage my emotions a little bit more.
[00:42:16.920] 我一直在努力更好地控制自己的情绪。
[00:42:20.360] I think also verbalizing feelings helps a lot for me.
[00:42:20.360] 我认为把感受说出来对我很有帮助。
[00:42:24.320] So putting things that are abstract,
[00:42:24.320] 所以，把抽象的东西表达出来，
[00:42:26.179] like thoughts and feelings into like physical words
[00:42:26.179] 将思想和感受转化为文字
[00:42:28.760] in itself is very therapeutic for me.
[00:42:28.760] 对我来说，这本身就是一种很好的疗愈方式。
[00:42:31.280] And the other thing that I've been doing,
[00:42:31.280] 我一直在做的另一件事是，
[00:42:33.079] I've been trying to channel all my emotions,
[00:42:33.079] 我一直在努力疏导我的所有情绪，
[00:42:35.400] especially the negative ones during exercise.
[00:42:35.400] 尤其是运动过程中出现的负面情绪。
[00:42:37.880] So I've been going on what I call rage runs.
[00:42:37.880] 所以我一直在进行我称之为“愤怒跑”的活动。
[00:42:40.239] Oh my God.
[00:42:40.239] 我的天啊。
[00:42:41.079] And it's been helping so much
[00:42:41.079] 它真的帮了我很多。
[00:42:42.039] because the entire time I'm like fantasizing
[00:42:42.039] 因为我全程都在幻想
[00:42:43.679] about something that I feel like is very frustrating or like weighing on me.
[00:42:43.679] 这件事让我感到非常沮丧，或者说一直压在我的心头。
[00:42:47.360] And because I'm releasing it in both my thoughts
[00:42:47.360] 因为我把它释放在我的两个念头里。
[00:42:49.800] and also physically, I think it's been helping me a little bit.
[00:42:49.800] 而且从身体上来说，我觉得它也对我有所帮助。
[00:42:54.920] A valid actually.
[00:42:54.920] 实际上，这确实有效。
[00:42:55.880] I think exercise is good for it.
[00:42:55.880] 我认为运动对它有好处。
[00:42:57.320] Yeah.
[00:42:57.320] 是的。
[00:42:57.820] Release is endorphins too.
[00:42:57.820] 释放过程中也会释放内啡肽。
[00:42:58.639] Dude, highly recommend Rage Run.
[00:42:58.639] 兄弟，强烈推荐 Rage Run。
[00:43:01.920] R&R, Rage and brain gen running R and R.
[00:43:01.920] R&R、愤怒和大脑生成运行 R&R。
[00:43:05.519] I do also think about how your dad was like,
[00:43:05.519] 我也会想起你爸爸是什么样的人。
[00:43:09.480] you must become a home.
[00:43:09.480] 你必须成为一个家。
[00:43:11.000] You know, I didn't even realize
[00:43:11.000] 你知道吗，我甚至都没意识到
[00:43:13.360] that was like a personal trauma for me,
[00:43:13.360] 那对我来说就像是一次个人创伤。
[00:43:14.719] but I think it actually led.
[00:43:14.719] 但我认为这实际上起到了带动作用。
[00:43:17.320] Just came out today.
[00:43:17.320] 今天刚上市。
[00:43:19.760] I agree with the exercise thing.
[00:43:19.760] 我同意锻炼的重要性。
[00:43:21.119] Like, Jimming is, it's really therapeutic.
[00:43:21.119] 就像吉明那样，真的很有疗愈作用。
[00:43:23.840] You're just kind of like letting out all your angry energy kind of. So I don't do it every time. I think
[00:43:23.840] 你只是在发泄一下所有的愤怒情绪。所以我不会每次都这样做。我觉得
[00:43:29.559] one that really works well for me. I'm not consistent with it because I don't have like
[00:43:29.559] 一个对我来说真的很好用的。但我没能坚持用，因为我没有……
[00:43:34.480] consistently have Alpurs either. But um, like when something's like really bothering me,
[00:43:34.480] 我也一直都有阿尔珀斯。但是，嗯，比如当有什么事真的让我很烦恼的时候，
[00:43:40.280] I found that journaling actually helps a lot. It's kind of the same feeling as like vent like venting to someone, but you know, sometimes you don't want to like talk about this stuff
[00:43:40.280] 我发现写日记真的很有帮助。感觉有点像跟人倾诉，但你知道，有时候你就是不想谈论这些事。
[00:43:48.960] with other people or you're like, you're gonna think I'm like crazy. So sometimes I just like
[00:43:48.960] 跟其他人在一起的时候，你会觉得，你会觉得我疯了。所以有时候我就是喜欢
[00:43:53.920] start journaling and I don't really know where I'm going with it, but that's kind of the part
[00:43:53.920] 开始写日记，我也不知道最终会写成什么样，但这就是重点。
[00:43:57.360] where you're like unpacking and I honestly feel like a lot better after I do it. So that's something
[00:43:57.360] 就像你在整理行李一样，说实话，我整理完之后感觉好多了。所以这算是一种安慰吧。
[00:44:02.719] that's like working pretty well for me. Nice.
[00:44:02.719] 对我来说效果相当不错。很好。
[00:44:05.760] That's a good one.
[00:44:05.760] 那真是个好主意。
[00:44:06.599] Yeah, I think I've also done journaling
[00:44:06.599] 是的，我想我也写过日记。
[00:44:08.960] in like high emotional moments as well.
[00:44:08.960] 在情绪高涨的时刻也是如此。
[00:44:12.159] And it definitely kind of helps.
[00:44:12.159] 这确实有点帮助。
[00:44:13.639] It's also kind of interesting to look back on it sometimes
[00:44:13.639] 有时回头看看也挺有意思的。
[00:44:16.280] and you're like, oh my God, I remember the emotions
[00:44:16.280] 然后你会想，哦，天哪，我记得那些情绪
[00:44:18.440] I was feeling.
[00:44:18.440] 我当时感觉……
[00:44:20.280] I remember what happened to you.
[00:44:20.280] 我记得你遭遇的一切。
[00:44:22.559] Another thing that I sometimes do
[00:44:22.559] 我有时还会做另一件事
[00:44:24.840] for emotional management, I guess, is
[00:44:24.840] 我想，就情绪管理而言，是
[00:44:28.000] I really sit with the emotion.
[00:44:28.000] 我会好好体会这种情绪。
[00:44:30.320] So sometimes, if I'm sad, I'm like, okay, I guess I'll just embrace it.
[00:44:30.320] 所以有时候，如果我感到难过，我就会想，好吧，我想我只能接受它了。
[00:44:34.239] I'll just lie in bed, I'll play some sad music, and then I'll listen to it.
[00:44:34.239] 我打算躺在床上，放些悲伤的音乐，然后静静地听。
[00:44:37.440] I'll be like, okay.
[00:44:37.440] 我会说，好吧。
[00:44:38.960] Oh, I did it too, actually.
[00:44:38.960] 哦，其实我也这么做了。
[00:44:41.199] Yeah.
[00:44:41.199] 是的。
[00:44:41.760] It's like wallowing in your face.
[00:44:41.760] 这简直就像在你面前翻滚一样。
[00:44:43.039] Yeah.
[00:44:43.039] 是的。
[00:44:43.519] It is, like, but then it passes.
[00:44:43.519] 确实是这样，但过一会儿就过去了。
[00:44:44.880] Exactly. Is it a two actually? Yeah, it's like wallowing in your face. It is like, but then it passes.
[00:44:44.880] 没错。真的是二吗？是啊，就像在你面前翻江倒海一样。确实如此，但过一会儿就过去了。
[00:44:45.000] Exactly.
[00:44:45.000] 确切地。
[00:44:46.280] So instead of maybe running away from it
[00:44:46.280] 所以，与其逃避它，不如……
[00:44:48.559] or trying to distract yourself from it,
[00:44:48.559] 或者试图分散自己的注意力，
[00:44:50.639] just kind of like wallowing in it.
[00:44:50.639] 就像是沉溺其中一样。
[00:44:52.079] And then I guess sometimes the feeling is,
[00:44:52.079] 然后我想，有时候这种感觉是……
[00:44:54.679] oh, it's actually not that bad, you know?
[00:44:54.679] 哦，其实没那么糟糕，你知道吗？
[00:44:56.239] Like, passes a bit.
[00:44:56.239] 就像，稍微通过了一下。
[00:44:57.679] And then you're like, okay, I guess sad hour's over.
[00:44:57.679] 然后你就会想，好吧，我想悲伤的时刻已经过去了。
[00:45:01.360] Yeah, I think that does help
[00:45:01.360] 是的，我觉得这确实有帮助。
[00:45:02.440] because you're not like compartmentalizing it.
[00:45:02.440] 因为你没有把它分类处理。
[00:45:05.239] You're actually somewhat focusing on it a little bit and processing it.
[00:45:05.239] 你其实有点在关注这件事，并且正在思考它。
[00:45:08.400] So because you're not just like shoving it to the side,
[00:45:08.400] 所以因为你不是简单地把它推到一边，
[00:45:11.320] it does pass a little bit like smoother resolution.
[00:45:11.320] 它的确有点像更平滑的分辨率。
[00:45:14.719] But I feel like you guys have a point with anger.
[00:45:14.719] 但我感觉你们说的愤怒也有道理。
[00:45:17.519] Anger kind of builds up energy.
[00:45:17.519] 愤怒会积聚能量。
[00:45:19.440] So you want to like do something.
[00:45:19.440] 所以你想做点什么。
[00:45:21.599] Exercising is probably a good route for that.
[00:45:21.599] 锻炼或许是解决这个问题的一个好方法。
[00:45:24.199] But I don't have too many things
[00:45:24.199] 但我东西不多。
[00:45:25.699] that trigger huge rage in me yet.
[00:45:25.699] 这件事至今仍让我怒火中烧。
[00:45:28.659] So I'll let you know when I have to take an hour.
[00:45:28.659] 所以如果我需要休息一个小时，我会通知你。
[00:45:32.460] Actually, I think for me,
[00:45:32.460] 实际上，我觉得对我来说，
[00:45:35.219] this episode recording in itself
[00:45:35.219] 本集录制本身
[00:45:37.420] has been very much a expression of my emotions.
[00:45:37.420] 一直是我情感的表达。
[00:45:41.500] And it's also kind of nice to take a more meta look
[00:45:41.500] 而且，从更宏观的角度来看待这个问题也很有意思。
[00:45:44.539] at how we do talk about and think about my emotions. And it's also kind of nice to take like a more meta look at like how we do talk about and think about our emotions.
[00:45:44.539] 思考我们如何谈论和思考我的情绪。而且，从更宏观的角度审视我们如何谈论和思考我们的情绪也很有意思。
[00:45:47.719] And I feel like it's been very validating to hear that.
[00:45:47.719] 听到这些话，我觉得很受肯定。
[00:45:50.119] Both of you guys go through these highs and lows,
[00:45:50.119] 你们俩都会经历这些高潮和低谷，
[00:45:52.679] which I feel like is very normal and human.
[00:45:52.679] 我觉得这很正常，也很人性化。
[00:45:54.480] So thank you Brian for joining us after four years
[00:45:54.480] 所以，布莱恩，感谢你时隔四年加入我们。
