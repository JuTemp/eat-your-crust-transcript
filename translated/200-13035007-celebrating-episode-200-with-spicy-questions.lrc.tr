[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. Happy 200th episode. Oh my god. Can't believe we've made it to the big 2-0-0.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。祝贺我们迎来第200期节目！我的天哪！简直不敢相信我们已经做到200期了！
[00:00:22.990] I know, right? It's really crazy to think because we publish an episode once a week, but we do take about a two or three week break during December and January. So that means we publish approximately 49 episodes a year. 200 divided by, let's just say 50, that's four years.
[00:00:22.990] 我知道，对吧？想想真的挺不可思议的，因为我们每周都更新一集，但每年12月和1月会休息两到三周。所以这意味着我们一年大约只更新49集。200除以，比如说50，那就是四年。
[00:00:48.330] And we did hit our official four-year anniversary a couple weeks ago actually, so the timing is actually just right. That's so crazy. I feel like when we talk to our friends, it feels very normal that it's like you two have your podcast going on. But sometimes when we quantify it, when we're like, oh yeah, it's been going on for like four years, going on five, everyone's just like, wait, holy shit, that's insane.
[00:00:48.330] 其实几周前我们正好庆祝了四周年纪念日，所以时机刚刚好。这太不可思议了。我觉得我们跟朋友聊起这件事的时候，他们觉得我们俩做播客很正常。但有时候当我们具体说出来，比如“哦，对啊，已经做了四年了，快五年了”，大家就会惊呼：“我的天，这也太疯狂了吧！”
[00:01:16.190] I feel like also I don't feel like it's crazy until people say that it is. And I'm like, you're right, it is crazy. Yeah. But it's so ingrained in our routine that it just feels normal. So true, so true. True. When people ask, they're like, dude, how do you keep it up every week? And I'm like, it's just part of life now. Admittedly, it was a little harder in the very beginning. That first year, I think we had some bumps.
[00:01:16.190] 我觉得，除非别人说这很疯狂，否则我平时都不觉得这很疯狂。然后我就想，你说得对，这确实很疯狂。没错。但这已经深深融入我们的日常生活，感觉就像理所当然一样。确实如此，确实如此。没错。当别人问起时，他们会说，老兄，你怎么能每周都坚持下来？我就说，这已经是生活的一部分了。当然，一开始确实有点难。第一年，我们遇到了一些波折。
[00:01:43.650] And at least in my mindset, it was like, oh shoot, I can't bail. Jesus is depending on me. But you probably had something similar where it's like, not that we wanted to bail, but if it's like the thought pops up, it's like, wait, no, I can't flake because Jesus is waiting on me on the other end. And then that eventually just became routine. And now it's just like it's ingrained in our lives.
[00:01:43.650] 至少在我当时的想法里，就是：糟了，我不能爽约。耶稣在等着我呢。但你可能也有过类似的经历，不是说我们想爽约，而是如果这个念头突然冒出来，我们就会想：等等，不行，我不能临阵脱逃，因为耶稣在另一端等着我呢。然后，这最终就成了我们的习惯。现在，它就像根植于我们的生活之中。
[00:02:07.630] It's so funny, too, because I mean, first of all, I definitely had those thoughts of like, okay, I have to show up like crystals on the other side. But it's also funny because the podcast is so integrated into our life now where like when I think about other things, long term travel or weekend trips, I'm always like, okay, need to do this for the podcast before we go and blah, blah, blah. So it's even a part of setup of like other aspects of life. Dude, you're so right.
[00:02:07.630] 这真的太搞笑了，因为首先，我确实有过那种想法，比如，好吧，我得像水晶一样出现在节目里。但更搞笑的是，播客现在已经完全融入我们的生活了，比如我想到其他事情的时候，像长途旅行或者周末短途旅行，我总是会想，好吧，出发前得先把播客的素材准备好，等等等等。所以它甚至成了我们生活其他方面准备工作的一部分。兄弟，你说得太对了。
[00:02:34.130] Like our listeners might not know, but like whenever we travel, we always consider like, am I packing my microphone for this trip? So true. Sometimes I joke the relationship with our podcast is like the longest relationship that I've been in. Dude, four years is nothing to sneeze at. Right?
[00:02:34.130] 听众可能不知道，我们每次旅行都会考虑“这次要不要带麦克风？”。确实如此。我有时开玩笑说，我们和播客的关系就像我谈过最久的恋爱。老兄，四年可不是小数目，对吧？
[00:02:57.150] Since this is our 200th episode and kind of also our celebration for like hitting the four year mark, we've decided that we'll do a spicy questions episode similar to last year. But we've tried to come up with some new questions or maybe just like funny stories to share. This episode is meant for just us kind of having fun and enjoying this recording. Yeah. So hope everyone enjoys us answering spicy questions.
[00:02:57.150] 因为这是我们的第200期节目，也算是庆祝我们开播四周年，所以我们决定做一期类似去年的“劲爆问答”特辑。不过这次我们想了一些新问题，或者分享一些有趣的小故事。这期节目就是我们自己开心录制，享受过程。希望大家喜欢我们回答这些劲爆问题。
[00:03:27.090] And to cement that this is a celebration, Crystal and I have sipped on a couple of drinks. Nothing crazy, but we did get a little warm and loose for this episode. Loosening up for sure. All right. Let's start off with the first question, which is what's the first thing you would do if you woke up one day and you were the opposite sex? Ooh, okay. This is definitely NSFW, but it's not like gruesome.
[00:03:27.090] 为了营造庆祝的气氛，我和克丽丝塔尔小酌了几杯。没什么特别的，不过为了这期节目，我们确实有点放松了。绝对放松了。好了，我们先从第一个问题开始：如果你有一天醒来发现自己变成了异性，你会做的第一件事是什么？哦，好吧。这绝对有点少儿不宜，但也没那么可怕。
[00:03:54.970] But I would definitely just like play with my dick. Play with it. As in like, I feel like it's a whole new limb, right? So I would like probably walk around and like get a feel of it and like try to slap it on my thighs. Is that too graphic? Just helicopter it around. Yeah, exactly. I'd be like, dude, whoa, what is this thing, you know?
[00:03:54.970] 但我肯定想玩玩我的小弟弟。玩玩它。就像，我觉得它就像一个全新的肢体，对吧？所以我可能会走来走去，感受一下它，然后试着用它拍打我的大腿。这样说会不会太露骨了？就像直升机螺旋桨一样甩来甩去。对，没错。我会想，老兄，哇，这玩意儿是啥？
[00:04:25.270] That's true. I mean, that is probably one of the biggest differences between us and the male sex. Would you try to give yourself a boner and see how well you could hide it? Whoa. Actually, yes. I think I would try to like basically squeeze in all of the like male experience in a day. You know, I'm like, okay, like guys sometimes talk about how when they like take a giant sidestep, it's because they're like trying to unstick their balls from their thigh or something.
[00:04:25.270] 没错。我的意思是，这大概是我们和男性之间最大的区别之一。你会试着让自己勃起，然后看看你能藏得怎么样吗？哇哦。真的，会的。我想我会试着在一天之内体验所有男性的感受。你知道，我就像，好吧，就像有些男人会说，他们突然大幅度侧身，是因为他们想把蛋蛋从大腿上弄下来之类的。
[00:04:56.150] Like I need to know what that feels like. Like I'd also probably try on all of the variations of underwear, like boxers versus boxer briefs versus like tighty whities. I don't know if there's any other variations, but I'd probably like try them all and be like, okay, which one is the best? Which one is superior? That is such a good point, actually. Because I mean, I guess in feminine underwear, like there are variations, but we don't have any that's like super loose like boxers are.
[00:04:56.150] 我得知道那是什么感觉。我可能还会试穿各种款式的内裤，比如平角裤、三角裤、紧身白内裤等等。我不知道还有没有其他款式，但我大概会全都试一遍，然后琢磨：哪种最好？哪种最棒？你说的很有道理。因为我觉得，女性内裤虽然也有各种款式，但没有像平角裤那样超级宽松的。
[00:05:24.370] And it makes me wonder, like, what does that feel like? Is it like super breezy and comfortable or does it leave too much room for stickiness and movement? Like, I don't know. Also, I feel like being a guy, you can just walk around to places with confidence. Do you know what I mean? Like at night or just in general? At night for sure. And in general, kind of too. Like I would try to just like do things that like guys don't get judged for, but girls do.
[00:05:24.370] 这让我不禁好奇，穿那种衣服是什么感觉？是超级透气舒适，还是太黏腻、太容易走动？我也不知道。还有，我觉得作为男生，你可以自信地到处走走。你明白我的意思吗？比如晚上，或者平时？晚上肯定算。平时也差不多。比如，我会尽量做一些男生不会被评判，但女生会被评判的事情。
[00:05:52.950] I can't think of exact examples in my head right now, but I feel like just walking around in general, you might get the sense too. I can see that. Like you walk into a room and you kind of like demand respect a little bit. A little bit, right? Yeah. I think what I would do is like go to a beach and just be like topless. Whoa. Like what is that like, you know? Wait, that's such a good one. You're right. I often think about that as a woman.
[00:05:52.950] 我现在脑子里想不出具体的例子，但我觉得随便走走，你可能也能感受到。我能理解。就像你走进一个房间，你会稍微要求别人尊重你一点。稍微，对吧？嗯。我想我会做的就是去海滩，然后就光着上身。哇哦。那会是什么感觉，你知道吗？等等，这真是个好主意。你说得对。作为一个女人，我经常会想这个问题。
[00:06:22.110] Like we can't just be topless. Yeah. The closest we can get is like we have a bra or like a bikini top or something. I mean, yes, we could go to nude beaches, but it's not quite the same as like when a guy is just casually shirtless. Yeah. I would. Okay. This is also kind of a weird one. I would want to get kicked in the balls because guys always complain about how it's so painful and I'm sure it is, but I just can't picture what that pain is like.
[00:06:22.110] 我们不能就这么光着上身。是啊。我们最多也就是穿个胸罩或者比基尼上衣之类的。我的意思是，没错，我们可以去天体海滩，但这跟男生随意光着上身的感觉完全不一样。是啊。我会的。好吧。还有一点也挺奇怪的。我想被人踢裆，因为男生总是抱怨踢裆有多疼，我肯定确实很疼，但我就是想象不出那种感觉。
[00:06:49.870] Like I can only think of things that I felt before as like a base, right? I'm like, is it similar to period cramps? But sometimes guys are like, oh, getting kicked in the nuts, you feel like kidney pain or something. So, you know, got to experience it at least once, right? Dude, that's a really good one. You can finally settle the like unspoken debate. True.
[00:06:49.870] 我只能把以前的感觉当成基础，对吧？我就想，这感觉跟痛经差不多吗？但有时候男生会说，哦，被踢到蛋蛋，感觉就像肾疼什么的。所以，你知道，至少得体验一次，对吧？哥们，这真是个好例子。你终于可以终结这场心照不宣的争论了。没错。
[00:07:14.470] I'm biased here, but I think period cramps win as like the more painful one because if you're getting a period every month, you experience this pain every month. But like how often do guys get kicked in the balls? They avoid it as much as they can. Yeah. And as long as you get over the middle school hump where I'm sure that happens like once a day, then you're probably safe for the rest of your adulthood. Right, right. But yeah, I think it would definitely be a very interesting day.
[00:07:14.470] 我承认我有点偏心，但我认为痛经更痛，因为每个月来月经，每个月都会经历这种疼痛。但是，男生被踢到蛋蛋的频率有多高呢？他们会尽可能避免这种情况。是啊。只要你熬过了中学时期（我敢肯定，那时候每天都会发生一次），那么你成年后应该就安全了。对，对。不过，我觉得那肯定会是非常有趣的一天。
[00:07:43.270] I think there would also be potential for like things that we can't even think of right now that like if we were the opposite sex for a day, you would experience and be like, oh, I didn't even think about this. But like, you know, such and such is happening. Oh, my God. Going into work as a man for a day. That's also probably so different.
[00:07:43.270] 我觉得也可能出现一些我们现在根本想不到的事情，比如如果我们有一天变成异性，就会体验到一些事情，然后惊呼：“哦，我之前都没想过这个。” 你知道吗，某某事情真的发生了。我的天哪！以男性的身份去上班一天，那感觉肯定也截然不同。
[00:08:05.030] Hopefully, most companies like the gender difference isn't very big, but I feel like in actuality, even if it's small, like subtle things, I feel like there is still sort of a difference between how men are treated and viewed versus women are treated and viewed. So I would just want to see what that's like. Talk to some higher ups with the confidence of a man. Wait, that's true.
[00:08:05.030] 希望大多数公司都认为性别差异不大，但我觉得实际上，即使是很小的差别，比如一些细微之处，男性和女性在待遇和看待方式上仍然存在差异。所以我想亲身体验一下。以男性的自信去和一些高层谈谈。等等，这倒是真的。
[00:08:26.930] Because I feel like also guys, when they like see each other and talk to each other, there's like kind of a, I don't know how to say it in words, but like a certain male understanding. You know what I mean? And it's kind of like how like when girls talk to each other, I feel like there's kind of like a female understanding there, too. True. And then, you know, sometimes it's just like kind of awkward when like a woman and a man are talking for the first time.
[00:08:26.930] 因为我觉得男生之间见面聊天的时候，会有一种，我不知道该怎么形容，但就是那种男性之间的默契。你懂我的意思吗？就像女生之间聊天一样，我觉得她们之间也有一种女性之间的默契。确实如此。而且，你知道，有时候男女第一次聊天的时候，气氛会有点尴尬。
[00:08:56.130] There might be some awkwardness there. But a woman and a woman talking for the first time, there might still be awkwardness, but it's like different. And I'm sure for like a man and a man, there might be awkwardness, but it's probably different than like, you know, woman plus man talking for the first time. Yeah. And a lot of companies, their higher ups tend to be male. So I'm sure that already kind of outlines a different experience. Dude, I also want to like dap up a guy.
[00:08:56.130] 可能会有点尴尬。但如果是两个女人第一次交谈，可能也会有点尴尬，但感觉不一样。我敢肯定，如果是两个男人，可能也会有点尴尬，但肯定和男女第一次交谈的感觉不一样。是啊。而且很多公司的高层都是男性。所以我觉得这本身就预示着不同的体验。哥们儿，我也想跟男生击个掌。
[00:09:24.670] Like meet as a guy, meet another guy, you know, outside of work for the first time. They just do that like head nod and they lean in for the dapping up or whatever. Like I want to do that. Wait, I love that. You're right. That would be so satisfying. Because like you can dap up a guy as a girl, but it's different. If anything, the guy might just be like, oh, shit, like you're trying to dap me up. Like that's cool. But if it's like, you know, just another dude, they're like, yeah, for sure. It's like the automatic. Yeah.
[00:09:24.670] 比如，你认识一个男生，或者第一次在工作之外认识另一个男生。他们会点点头，然后凑过来击掌什么的。我也想这么做。等等，我喜欢这样。你说得对。那感觉肯定很爽。因为女生也可以跟男生击掌，但感觉不一样。女生的话，男生可能会想，哦，天哪，你想跟我击掌？这很酷。但如果是那种，你知道的，普通的男生，他们会说，当然可以。就像是下意识的反应。没错。
[00:09:53.970] At least for our generation. It's like the automatic intro kind of. I feel like in my current body and like my current state of being, I can't dap someone up seriously. Like I feel like it would always be a joke. So I would have to have like a complete transformation to be able to do this. Oh, you know what I would also do actually? I would probably try to work out. Oh, like see if you can, you're like suddenly hella stronger. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:53.970] 至少对我们这代人来说是这样。这就像一种自动的开场白。我觉得以我现在的身体状态和精神状态，我没办法认真地跟人击掌。感觉那永远都像个玩笑。所以我得彻底改变自己才能做到。哦，你知道我还会做什么吗？我可能会尝试健身。看看能不能突然变得特别强壮。对，对。
[00:10:22.490] Like I'm no scientist, so I can't say for sure. But like it seems like they maybe build muscle in a different way, maybe like faster, anything like that. So I think it could be interesting to kind of try to work out in a male body and like see the difference if there is any. Dude, like doing pull-ups. I feel like a lot of guys can, even if they're not visibly buff or super strong looking. But it's harder for women. And oh my God, you know what I would fucking do?
[00:10:22.490] 我不是科学家，所以不能妄下定论。但感觉她们练肌肉的方式可能不一样，也许速度更快之类的。所以我觉得尝试用男性的身体锻炼，看看有没有什么区别，应该挺有意思的。比如做引体向上。我觉得很多男人都能做，即使他们看起来并不肌肉发达或者特别强壮。但对女人来说就难多了。我的天哪，你知道我会怎么做吗？
[00:10:50.210] I would golf because sometimes when I golf, I also have T-Rex arms, so that might be why. But like I feel like because I have boobs, when I pull my arms together to grab the shaft of the club, you know, there's like an obstacle there. Yeah, yeah. Wait, that's actually so true. Like imagine running as a guy and you don't have like breasts. Oh my God. Running. That's so true. Jumping jacks. Like just jogging around, jumping. Yeah.
[00:10:50.210] 我打高尔夫是因为有时候打高尔夫的时候，我的胳膊就像霸王龙的胳膊一样，所以可能这就是原因。但我觉得，因为我有胸部，当我把胳膊并拢去握杆的时候，你知道，就像有个障碍物一样。是啊，是啊。等等，这真的太对了。想象一下，如果你是个男的，跑步的时候没有胸部，那该多难啊。我的天哪。跑步。这太对了。开合跳。就像慢跑、跳跃一样。是啊。
[00:11:17.750] And also like you could just wear clothes without a bra. Oh my God. That's fucking wild. I personally already, like if I can get away with it, I'll try not to wear a bra. Hoodies, like thicker shirts, things like that. Right. Right. But as a guy, you could wear the thinnest shirt and you would never have to wear a bra. That's so true. Like you can even wear a tight shirt and like your nipples poke through and like no one cares.
[00:11:17.750] 而且你还可以不穿胸罩就穿衣服。我的天哪。这也太疯狂了吧。我个人如果可以的话，会尽量不穿胸罩。比如穿连帽衫、厚一点的衬衫之类的。对，对。但作为男生，你可以穿最薄的衬衫，也完全不用穿胸罩。确实如此。你甚至可以穿紧身衣，乳头都凸出来了，也没人会在意。
[00:11:47.470] They're like, yeah, he's just a guy. They're like, it's just male nipples versus female nipples. It's like, oh shit, the nips are out to play. Anyways, should we move on to the next question now? So the next question I have is what's the biggest romantic fail you've ever experienced? Biggest romantic fail?
[00:11:47.470] 他们会说，是啊，他只是个男人。他们会说，这不过是男性乳头和女性乳头的区别罢了。然后我就想，我的天，乳头要出来玩了。好了，我们现在可以进入下一个问题了吗？我的下一个问题是，你经历过的最惨痛的恋爱失败是什么？最惨痛的恋爱失败？
[00:12:11.370] I've actually mentioned this on a podcast earlier, but I think it was probably that date that I mentioned where I offered to split the bill. And then the dude was like, oh, do you want points? You can just pay for the entire bill.
[00:12:11.370] 我之前在播客里提到过这件事，大概就是我提出AA制的那天吧。然后那家伙就说，哦，你想要积分吗？你也可以付全款。
[00:12:33.010] I think that might be the biggest romantic fail because I feel like what was a generous offer was like a misunderstood into a, oh, she wants her points. And that misunderstanding caused the whole situation to just be completely not romantic, you know? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, oh, damn, this experience is now colored with this awkwardness sort of. Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:33.010] 我觉得这可能是最失败的恋爱经历了，因为感觉原本慷慨的提议被误解成了“哦，她只是想要积分”。这种误会让整个过程完全失去了浪漫的气氛，你知道吗？哦，对，对，对。感觉就像，哎，这段经历现在充满了尴尬。没错，就是这样。
[00:13:03.290] It was like, oh, I mean, my intention was truly just to split the bill to hopefully be nice. Maybe that in itself is like not super romantic, but the fact that it ended up being like, oh, did you want points? Like you can pay for it then. Like that's where it became just like completely not romantic, you know? Yeah, that is a very unromantic thing to say or like it's a funny interpretation of the moment on his part.
[00:13:03.290] 当时我就想，哦，我的意思是，我真的只是想AA制，希望能表现得友好一些。也许这本身就不算特别浪漫，但结果他却问，哦，你想要积分吗？积分够了你就可以付钱了。这就完全不浪漫了，你知道吗？是啊，他这么说真的很不浪漫，或者说，他对当时情况的解读有点搞笑。
[00:13:32.590] Yeah, it's like no fault to him, but it was just like a very funny turn of events. Yeah. How about you? Do you have any romantic fails that come to mind? I do. So I can't remember if I've ever shared this story or not, but my first kiss was in middle school and it was kind of like a dare slash not even a real kiss. So I don't really count that one. Okay.
[00:13:32.590] 是啊，对他来说好像没什么错，但事情的发展真的挺搞笑的。嗯。你呢？你有没有什么恋爱失败的经历可以回忆起来？我有。我不记得我有没有讲过这个故事，我的初吻是在初中，那有点像是打赌，或者说根本算不上真正的吻。所以那不算数。好的。
[00:13:57.990] But my second first kiss was my first high school dance and I was a freshman and my date, I can't remember if we were actually boyfriend girlfriend or not. But my date to winter formal was a junior. So I was like, oh my God, it's so exciting. And he's like an older man, you know? So then I was like, this is so exciting and cool. But at the time, like he didn't have a car or I guess he didn't have his license yet or something.
[00:13:57.990] 但我第二次初吻是在我高中第一次舞会上，当时我高一，我的舞伴——我记不清我们当时是不是男女朋友关系了——我冬季舞会的舞伴是个高二的学生。所以我当时就想，天哪，太激动了！而且他年纪比我大很多，你知道吗？所以我就觉得，这太刺激太酷了。但当时，他好像没有车，或者我猜他还没拿到驾照之类的。
[00:14:25.450] Because I feel like junior year is kind of that age where some people do, some people don't. He was like, oh yeah, like I can pick you up or whatever. But I guess I just didn't realize he didn't have a license. So I was like super excited. He pulls up in this like huge white Escalade and I was like, oh my God, this is so cool. And then I like, you know, step out of the house and he's like walking me to his car. He like opens the back seat because his mom was driving in the front seat.
[00:14:25.450] 因为我觉得高二这个年纪，有些人会考驾照，有些人不会。他当时说，哦，对啊，我可以来接你什么的。但我当时没意识到他没有驾照。所以我特别兴奋。他开着一辆巨大的白色凯迪拉克凯雷德过来，我当时就想，我的天哪，这也太酷了吧。然后我走出家门，他就带我到他的车旁。他打开了后座，因为他妈妈当时坐在前排开车。
[00:14:55.910] And I was like, oh my God. So wait, question. Did you both sit in the back seat together or did he sit shotgun? We both sat in the back seat together. And then he was like trying to hold my hand. And I was like, your mom is like right there. And I guess hand holding is innocent, but it's just weird, right? He was like, I have a little gift for you. And I was like, oh my God, you know how you can get like box sets of jewelry from like Macy's or something.
[00:14:55.910] 我当时就想，我的天哪。等等，问个问题。你们俩是一起坐在后座，还是他坐在副驾驶？我们俩一起坐在后座。然后他就想牵我的手。我就说，你妈就在旁边呢。牵手虽然没什么大不了的，但就是感觉怪怪的，对吧？他说，我给你准备了个小礼物。我就想，我的天哪，你知道那种在梅西百货之类的店里买的珠宝套装吗？
[00:15:24.210] So he had picked up like an earring and necklace set and it was like heart shaped jewelry or whatever. And I was like, wow, this is very sweet actually. But it was also like, this is so mean, but I was like, it's also kind of ugly. Like I would never wear this. So then I was just like, oh my God, like thank you. Like I was still very grateful, but I was kind of like, oh shit, like what should I do with this? Like I don't think I really like it. Like bratty child Jesus. Wait, yeah. What's wrong with me? I was so ungrateful.
[00:15:24.210] 所以他挑了一套耳环和项链，好像是心形的什么的。我当时就想，哇，这其实挺贴心的。但同时又觉得，这太损了，而且，这东西也挺丑的。我肯定不会戴的。然后我就想，我的天哪，谢谢你。我当时真的很感激，但又有点不知所措，心想，糟了，我该拿它怎么办？我好像不太喜欢它。就像个任性的孩子。等等，是啊。我这是怎么了？我真是太不知感恩了。
[00:15:54.000] But we like go to the dance and it was fine. I honestly can't even remember what the dance was like. I think most of it was just me being in shock at what high school dances were like. Because I was like, people are standing so close to each other. There's no room for Jesus. The dance is over, whatever. His mom comes to like pick us up. And then like his mom had parked in the parking garage nearby because it was like at a museum or something. We like get to his mom's car and then he's like, oh, don't go inside yet. And I was like, okay.
[00:15:54.000] 但我们还是去了舞会，一切都还好。说实话，我都记不清舞会是什么样子了。我觉得大部分时间我都懵了，不知道高中舞会到底是什么样子。因为当时我就想，大家站得那么近，简直没地方待着。舞会结束了，就这样吧。他妈妈来接我们。他妈妈把车停在附近的停车场，好像是因为舞会是在博物馆之类的地方。我们走到他妈妈的车旁，他妈妈说，哦，先别进去。我就说，好的。
[00:16:24.060] So then we stood outside his car while his mom was in the front seat. And then he kissed me. And I was like. Oh my God. I was like, please. For the love of God. Wait, wait, wait. This was prom or was it a formal? It was winter formal. And you guys had it off campus? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. His poor mom just waited in the car for like three hours.
[00:16:24.060] 所以我们就站在他车外，他妈妈坐在前排。然后他就吻了我。我当时就懵了，我的天哪。我心想，拜托，老天爷啊。等等，等等，等等。这是毕业舞会还是正式舞会？是冬季舞会。你们是在校外办的？是啊，是啊。哇。他可怜的妈妈在车里等了三个小时。
[00:16:52.580] I think she, it was like in San Jose. So she probably like went home after she dropped us off and then came back to pick us up. But it was just really, I was like, dude, like we could have done this during the formal or something. And also his mom is in the car just waiting for us. Not that it was very long. It was probably like a minute and a half or something. Of making out? No, just like, you know, the, like the preamble to the kiss, you know? Like, oh, okay.
[00:16:52.580] 我觉得她当时应该在圣何塞。所以她可能送我们到之后就回家了，然后再回来接我们。但当时我就想，老兄，我们本来可以在正式舞会上做这件事的。而且他妈妈还在车里等着我们呢。时间也不长，大概也就一分半钟吧。接吻？不，就是那种，你知道的，接吻前的铺垫，你知道吗？就像，哦，好吧。
[00:17:21.400] There's like words shared. I was like, damn, you made out for a minute and a half while she's just sitting there looking in her rear view mirror. Oh my God. Dude, but, oh God. I didn't even think about the fact that she could have been watching us. I probably would if I was a mom. But, dude, she definitely was. It was also just bad because after the kiss, like I also have to get in the car, right? Yeah. So it's just like knowing that she was there.
[00:17:21.400] 我们之间好像说了些什么。我当时就想，天哪，你们亲热了一分半钟，而她就坐在那儿看着后视镜。我的天啊。老兄，我的天啊。我根本没想过她可能在看着我们。如果我是个妈妈，我肯定会想到。但是，老兄，她肯定在。更糟糕的是，亲完之后，我还得上车，对吧？是啊。所以一想到她就在那里，就觉得很不安。
[00:17:47.020] I think throughout the evening I realized I actually didn't have feelings for this person, even though I thought I did. Holy shit, this is just worse and worse. I know. And then he was like, oh my God, like this was such a good night, like blah, blah, blah. And then we like split up on a good note. But after that, every time I saw him, I like thought about his mom. Oh my God. And we ended things shortly. I have a question.
[00:17:47.020] 我觉得那天晚上我渐渐意识到，我其实对这个人没有感觉，尽管我之前以为自己有。天哪，这简直越来越糟了。我知道。然后他就说，哦我的天，昨晚真是太棒了，诸如此类。然后我们就友好地分开了。但之后，每次见到他，我都会想起他的妈妈。天哪。我们很快就分手了。我有个问题。
[00:18:14.380] Was the white Escalade like already a car that his family owned? Yeah, I think it was their family car. Oh, okay, okay. I was going to say like that's very like kind of fancy. Yeah, I mean, I was very impressed until I realized he wasn't driving it. Dude, that's a good story though. It's also just funny because now that I think about it, the other high school dances I went to,
[00:18:14.380] 那辆白色凯迪拉克凯雷德是他家的车吗？嗯，我想应该是他们家的车。哦，好吧好吧。我本来想说，这车真够豪华的。是啊，我一开始还挺佩服的，直到我发现他没开。哥们儿，这故事挺有意思的。而且现在想想也挺搞笑的，我以前参加过的其他高中舞会，
[00:18:41.700] I think there was only one time where the guy actually picked me up and drove me. Every other time I like drove me and my date to the dance. Because I had gotten a car like fairly early on in junior year. So sophomore year, I think was the only time someone really picked me up. And then after that, it was like just my car. Dude, you were scarred. Wait, did you guys not get like party buses or like limos for prom?
[00:18:41.700] 我想只有一次是男生开车来接我。其他时候都是我和舞伴一起开车去舞会。因为我高二的时候就买了车。所以高二那年，好像只有一次有人来接我。之后就都是我自己开车了。哥们儿，你当时肯定吓坏了吧。等等，你们舞会的时候难道没租派对巴士或者豪华轿车吗？
[00:19:08.960] Oh, we had a party bus once I think. We got limos like one time for senior prom or junior prom maybe. But I think the other times I just drove. I guess like if anything, you drove your date to the like meeting spot and then you guys went on the party bus or limo or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just funny like driving in really high heels.
[00:19:08.960] 哦，我们好像租过一次派对巴士。还有一次，好像是高三或者高二的毕业舞会，我们租了豪华轿车。不过其他时候好像都是我开车。我猜大概就是你开车送你的约会对象到集合地点，然后你们一起坐派对巴士或者豪华轿车什么的。对啊。对啊。穿着超高跟鞋开车真的挺搞笑的。
[00:19:34.760] I shared earlier on a podcast episode that I would buy these insane heels for the high school dances. Like driving in those was actually a fucking nightmare. I learned to bring sandals so that I didn't have to drive in stiletto heels. Dude, this is probably really shallow. But in high school, one of my like requirements for dating people was they had to be able to drive.
[00:19:34.760] 我之前在播客节目里说过，我高中舞会的时候会买那种超级夸张的高跟鞋。穿着那种鞋开车简直是噩梦。后来我学会了带凉鞋，这样就不用穿着细高跟鞋开车了。哥们儿，我知道这听起来很肤浅。但高中时，我择偶的标准之一就是对方必须会开车。
[00:20:01.040] Like it's so fucked up because as early as freshman year, I'd be like, yeah, they have to like drive. I guess maybe not that many people drove at my school or OK. I guess also I had a very narrow window of who I was interested in at our school. So I didn't have that luxury of seeing who had a car and who didn't. I see. I see. At our school, we were an open campus for lunch. So most people, if they could, they would they would drive to school.
[00:20:01.040] 真是太糟糕了，因为早在大一的时候，我就觉得，是啊，他们肯定得开车。我猜可能是我们学校开车的人不多吧。而且，我当时感兴趣的范围也很窄，所以没机会去观察谁有车谁没车。我明白了。我明白了。我们学校午餐时间是开放式的，所以大多数人如果可以的话，都会开车来学校。
[00:20:30.340] Man, it's like so funny looking back at these things that happened to us in like high school. I can't believe you had to have your second first kiss in front of your love interest's mom. Oh, my God. It's actually so cursed. Well, I guess that's a good segue into the next question, which is what's the craziest thing you've ever done to attract a crush? Well, I guess I'll start.
[00:20:30.340] 哎，回想起高中时发生的那些事，真是太搞笑了。难以置信你居然要在心仪对象的妈妈面前献出你的第二次初吻。我的天哪。这简直太不吉利了。好吧，我想这正好引出了下一个问题，那就是你为了吸引心仪对象做过的最疯狂的事是什么？嗯，那我就先来吧。
[00:20:55.580] I think my answer to this is not necessarily to attract a crush, but it was like something I did to kind of hang out with him after we were sort of talking already. In junior year, my crush or like the person I was talking to went to a different high school. So it's pretty hard to like meet up with someone when they don't go to your school unless you're spending a lot of time after school or something to hang out.
[00:20:55.580] 我觉得我这么做并不是为了吸引心仪的对象，而是为了在我们开始聊天之后能和他多待一会儿。高二的时候，我暗恋的那个人，或者说我当时正在聊天的那个人，在另一所高中。所以，如果对方不在你所在的学校，除非你放学后花很多时间跟他/她一起玩，否则很难约到他/她见面。
[00:21:19.860] But the thing is, in junior year, as I'm sure many people know, that's like one of the most intensive school years, I would say, in terms of academics. Not only are you taking a shit ton of APs, it's also when you do like SAT stuff and like start to kind of prep for college essays and things like that. So, you know, pretty packed schedule and like a long to do list pretty much.
[00:21:19.860] 但问题是，正如许多人所知，高二可以说是学业压力最大的一年。你不仅要修很多AP课程，还要准备SAT考试，还要开始准备大学申请文书等等。所以，你知道，日程安排得满满当当，待办事项清单也很长。
[00:21:43.460] So in order to hang out with this guy, I would go to his high school's AP U.S. history study sessions that were held after school. I was also in AP U.S. history. So, you know, it helped. And it was like in some way studying. We had like a little foursome. So it was me and my friend and she was seeing my crush's friend. So the four of us would like go to these study sessions together.
[00:21:43.460] 为了能和他一起玩，我会去他高中放学后举办的AP美国历史学习小组。我自己也选修了AP美国历史，所以你知道，这很有帮助。某种程度上来说，这也算是学习。我们四个人组成了一个小团体。我和我朋友，还有她当时正在和我暗恋对象的朋友交往。所以我们四个会一起去参加这些学习小组。
[00:22:08.220] And honestly, like we probably weren't even really listening or studying, but it was just like an excuse with merit, I guess, like a worthy excuse to like hang out with each other while still saying we were studying. So we did that like a handful of times. I remember in junior year. Oh, my God. It was basically a double date. It was. We'll just pop over and like go to the study session.
[00:22:08.220] 说实话，我们可能根本没在认真听讲也没认真学习，但这算是个不错的借口吧，一个既能聚在一起又能说自己在学习的好借口。所以我们这么做了好几次。我记得是在高二那年。我的天哪。那简直就是一次双人约会。真的。我们就顺道过去，然后去参加学习小组。
[00:22:37.100] But now that I think about it, I'm like, dude, that wasn't even my fucking high school. Like like none of the students there knew me except like some of my crush's friends or whatever. And it's just like that's so fucking weird, you know. Wait, that's so funny. It's kind of cute, though. And like at least it was helpful in the long run. Yeah, that's true. OK, I thought of a couple. So one is like really embarrassing.
[00:22:37.100] 但现在想想，我心想，老兄，那根本不是我上的高中。那里的学生除了我暗恋对象的朋友之类的，根本没人认识我。这感觉真是太奇怪了，你知道吗？等等，这太搞笑了。不过也挺可爱的。而且从长远来看，至少这对我有好处。是啊，没错。好吧，我又想到几个例子。其中一个真的挺尴尬的。
[00:23:03.620] I don't know if I want to share it, but I have another one that is like a little less embarrassing. And I'll share that one. There was a guy who I was interested in. And the thing is that like he was also interested in me. But I think we just like we couldn't say it out loud to each other. That guy was also like a very nice, like kind person.
[00:23:03.620] 我不知道该不该分享，但我还有另一个故事，稍微好一点，没那么尴尬。我就分享那个吧。我曾经喜欢过一个男生，而且他也喜欢我。但我觉得我们就是不好意思跟对方说出口。那个男生人也很好，很善良。
[00:23:31.040] There was like a friend of ours who. Oh, my God, this is so complicated. Sorry. I was at the time I was a sophomore. That guy was a senior. And then we had like a mutual friend who was a junior. That mutual friend. She was kind of talking about how like she didn't really have anyone who she was super interested in going to prom with.
[00:23:31.040] 当时我们有个朋友……哦，我的天，这事儿太复杂了。不好意思。我当时是大二，他（指大四学生）是大四。然后我们还有一个共同的朋友，她是大三。就是那个共同的朋友。她当时在说，她好像没什么特别想一起去参加毕业舞会的人。
[00:23:56.700] And then because of that, she wasn't sure if like she would even get a date because she was like, well, you know, like there's no one that I'm really trying to go with. I don't really even know if I will have a date. And then, you know, the senior guy being the quote unquote nice guy that he was. He like offered himself. Oh, my God. He was like, oh, like if you can't find a date, like I could be your date, which is very kind. Right.
[00:23:56.700] 所以，因为这件事，她甚至不确定自己能不能约到会，因为她觉得，你知道，我其实没有特别想去的人。我甚至不知道自己能不能约到会。然后，你知道，那位学长，他真是个“好人”，主动提出可以陪她。我的天哪。他说，如果你找不到约会对象，我可以陪你，真是太好了。对吧。
[00:24:23.300] But the thing is, like me and that dude, we had been kind of talking. There was like, I don't know, something between us, I guess. But it was like almost ambiguous because he's such a nice guy. I couldn't truly tell. So when that happened, I was like, damn, OK, maybe this isn't something. So those two end up going to prom. And then I guess I was kind of like maybe a little salty. So I was like, fuck, like maybe I should go to junior prom. Oh, shit.
[00:24:23.300] 但问题是，我和那家伙之前一直在聊天。感觉我们之间有点儿……我也不知道该怎么形容，大概是这样吧。但又有点儿暧昧，因为他是个挺好的人。我真说不准。所以那件事发生后，我就想，完了，好吧，也许我们之间没什么。结果他们俩最后去了毕业舞会。然后我可能有点儿不爽。我就想，操，也许我也该去参加初中毕业舞会。哦，天哪。
[00:24:53.880] Keep in mind, I'm a sophomore at this time. So like I can't just go. Right. I need to have someone who will go with me. Uh-huh. An opportunity arose, I guess. And I was like, yeah, there is someone who I would absolutely be down to go to junior prom with. I'd be very happy to go with them. Someone had like asked me about it. So what ended up happening was that I went to junior prom with that particular junior. Oh, my God.
[00:24:53.880] 记住，我现在才大二。所以我不能自己去。对吧。我得找个人陪我去。嗯哼。机会来了，我想。然后我就想，对啊，有个朋友我绝对愿意一起去参加高二的毕业舞会。我非常乐意和她一起去。有人问过我这件事。所以最后的结果就是，我和那个高二的同学一起去了高二的毕业舞会。我的天哪。
[00:25:21.700] And after that prom happened, the senior guy, we were still talking kind of through this whole saga, I guess. He was like, by the way, I like you. Wait, so it worked. That's fucking genius. It kind of forced out some sort of confession. It's so stupid, too, because it's like, you know, high school and like everyone's stupid. No one knows how to communicate yet.
[00:25:21.700] 舞会之后，那个高年级的男生，我们之前还一直在聊这件事，大概就是这件事吧。他突然说，对了，我喜欢你。等等，这招居然奏效了。真是绝了。这招算是逼他表白了。不过也挺蠢的，毕竟是高中，大家都挺傻的。谁都不知道怎么好好沟通。
[00:25:47.360] And it was like maybe this dude didn't realize that like him offering himself or like, you know, even just the fact that he like went to a prom with some other girl when it felt like we had something going on felt bad for me. So then when I was like, OK, fuck this dude, then I'm going to go have fun with one of my friends and go to like junior prom with them. And then when the senior guy saw it and he was like, oh, shit, like, I guess I should confess because I don't like seeing that kind of, you know? Oh, my God.
[00:25:47.360] 感觉这家伙可能没意识到，他主动示好，或者说，你知道，甚至他跟别的女生一起去参加舞会这件事，都让我觉得很不好意思，毕竟我们之间好像有点什么。所以我就想，算了，管他呢，我要跟我的一个朋友一起去参加高二的舞会。结果那个高三的男生看到了，就说，哦，糟了，我好像应该表白，因为我不喜欢看到这种场面，你知道吗？我的天哪。
[00:26:17.340] I love this plan, though. That's amazing. I mean, OK, here's the thing. It wasn't really a sinister plan on my end. It was more like, yo, that's fucked up. If this dude is just going to be like this, then I should stop caring about him. And just like have my own fun. But the result just ended up being in like him confessing. I mean, from my perspective, like maybe that was what caused him to confess. And then I was like, OK, well, you know.
[00:26:17.340] 不过，我喜欢这个计划。简直太棒了。我是说，好吧，事情是这样的。这其实不是我精心策划的阴谋。更像是，哎，这太扯了。如果这家伙一直这样，那我应该不再理他，好好享受自己的乐趣。结果却让他坦白了。我的意思是，从我的角度来看，也许正是这件事促使他坦白了。然后我就想，好吧，你知道的。
[00:26:47.420] So it was the catalyst, but unintentionally. Yeah, yeah. OK, OK. I still feel like it's a master scheme. I mean, not in a bad way, right? It's just like it's a reasonable response to what he did. OK, OK. Yeah, I don't want it to seem like I truly was like sinisterly planning this because I really wasn't. I think at that point I was just like, fuck this dude. Like, I'm just going to have fun. I'm enjoying myself. So, yeah.
[00:26:47.420] 所以这算是催化剂，但并非有意为之。是啊，是啊。好吧，好吧。我仍然觉得这是个精心策划的阴谋。我的意思是，不是那种坏的阴谋，对吧？这只是对他所作所为的一种合理回应。好吧，好吧。是啊，我不想让人觉得我真的在阴险地策划这一切，因为我真的没有。我觉得当时我的想法就是，去他妈的。我就想玩玩。我玩得很开心。所以，是的。
[00:27:16.260] So did you guys interact at all during the prom? So basically what happened was he confessed right before prom. Oh, my God, that is even worse. But then it was like, OK, well, we already said yes to our respective people. So like we'll just basically ignore prom. Like prom is unaccounted for.
[00:27:16.260] 所以你们在舞会期间有互动吗？事情是这样的，他在舞会前才表白。我的天，这更糟糕了。但后来我们就想，好吧，反正我们都答应了各自的追求者。所以我们干脆就无视舞会了。舞会就这么算了。
[00:27:40.520] And then after prom, we will like resume whatever boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever the plan is after. Oh, interesting. Interesting. Yeah. So do you think your dates knew? They might not have known until maybe like senior prom came around because me and the guy ended up going to senior prom together. Wow. This is like the perfect high school juicy story. Is it really? Oh, God.
[00:27:40.520] 舞会结束后，我们就会继续和之前的男朋友、女朋友，或者其他什么计划。哦，有意思。有意思。是啊。那你觉得你的约会对象知道吗？他们可能直到毕业舞会才知道，因为我和那个男生最后一起去了毕业舞会。哇。这简直就是完美的高中八卦故事。真的吗？我的天哪。
[00:28:10.240] That's hella juicy, dude. I'm like kind of embarrassed that I have to share this. I think it's also just like classic high school miscommunication sort of or like the hesitance to do anything about your feelings. Like you look back and it's like honestly, it's like a trivial thing. It's unfair, like in case people's feelings might have been hurt. But like it's such a stupid reason. Like we just didn't know how to communicate. Like we were stupid back then. No. Yeah.
[00:28:10.240] 这也太劲爆了吧，兄弟。我都有点不好意思说出来。我觉得这就像典型的高中生沟通不畅，或者说是那种不敢表达自己感受的犹豫。现在回想起来，真的只是件小事。虽然有点不公平，万一伤了别人的心呢。但理由也太蠢了。我们当时就是不知道怎么沟通。那时候我们真是太傻了。没错。
[00:28:39.800] I feel like it's we just didn't have the skills to even bring these things up back then. Or maybe it's like you also just don't know what you're feeling, like what you're truly feeling. It only comes out through action sort of. Agree. Yeah, absolutely. I love that story. All right. Next question. What's your favorite go-to move for getting attention from the opposite sex? Ooh. Okay. Honestly, I don't really have like a go-to move.
[00:28:39.800] 我觉得那时候我们根本没那个本事去提起这些事。或者，也许你也不知道自己的感受，不知道自己真正的感受是什么。它只能通过行动来表达。同意。是啊，完全同意。我喜欢这个故事。好的。下一个问题。你最喜欢用什么招数来吸引异性的注意？哦。好吧。说实话，我其实没有什么特别的招数。
[00:29:07.520] Personally, I think that I am someone who is like I need time to get to know someone or have someone to get to know me before like things can be in motion. So it's not usually like a right off the bat. Like I got this move to like suck you in or whatever. Right. But what I have kind of noticed and learned is that if you just drop a compliment for a guy, anything. Like you'd be like, I like your jacket.
[00:29:07.520] 就我个人而言，我觉得我需要时间去了解一个人，或者让对方了解我，然后事情才能顺利发展。所以通常不会一开始就咄咄逼人，不会有什么特别的举动来吸引你。没错。但我注意到并学到的是，如果你只是简单地赞美一个男生，哪怕只是说一句“我喜欢你的外套”，效果都会很好。
[00:29:37.180] Or like you have a great haircut. Anything very simple. Guys love that. I guess like guys don't usually get a ton of compliments. I think it's like better nowadays. Right. Still on average, men aren't as used to getting compliments maybe.
[00:29:37.180] 或者比如夸你发型很棒。任何很简单的赞美都可以。男生喜欢这样。我觉得男生通常不太常收到赞美。我觉得现在情况好多了。没错。但总的来说，男生可能还是不太习惯收到赞美。
[00:29:56.780] So I feel like I've noticed if you just drop like a compliment to a dude just very randomly, it will at the very least get their attention. Dude, that's an interesting one too because something I've been noticing lately is like when we greet each other like us girlfriends, I feel like usually the greeting comes with some sort of variation of a compliment. True. Guys don't always do that. Although I think a lot of guy friends do.
[00:29:56.780] 我觉得我发现，如果你随便夸夸男生，至少能引起他们的注意。哥们儿，这也很耐人寻味，因为我最近也注意到，我们女生打招呼的时候，通常都会带点夸奖的成分。确实，男生不总是这么做。不过我觉得很多男性朋友会这么做。
[00:30:23.860] Like our guy friends specifically are pretty effusive with their compliments. But not everyone extends that level of complimenting to men, I think. So I've also been like, oh, maybe I should compliment my guy friends when I see them. So it's like make the playing field a little more even or like brighten up their day a little bit at least. No, for sure. For sure. Okay. I have two funny stories about compliments.
[00:30:23.860] 比如，我们男性朋友们特别爱夸人。但我觉得并不是每个人都会把这种夸奖的程度延伸到男性身上。所以我也一直在想，哦，也许我应该在见到男性朋友的时候也夸夸他们。这样至少能让彼此更平等一些，或者至少让他们开心一点。当然，绝对的。好的。我有两个关于夸奖的趣事。
[00:30:49.120] So one is that in a previous relationship, my boyfriend at the time, he was like, oh my God, like this random girl complimented my jacket. And I was like, oh, that's very nice of her. Like to me, it felt very normal, you know, because as you said, like a lot of girlfriends are usually pretty liberal with compliments. Right.
[00:30:49.120] 比如，我之前谈恋爱的时候，我当时的男朋友就说，天哪，有个陌生女孩夸我的外套好看。我就觉得，哦，她真好。我觉得这很正常，你知道，因为就像你说的，很多女朋友都挺爱夸人的。对吧。
[00:31:13.020] And then I noticed from that point on, like that particular jacket that was complimented was worn so much more. And I thought it was so funny. Wait, that's actually hilarious. Dude, right? And then my second story is that someone mentioned recently, they were just like, dude, like one of the highest compliments I could get is probably if like a girl asked me for my number randomly, like on the street.
[00:31:13.020] 然后我注意到，从那以后，那件被夸奖的夹克穿的次数明显增多。我觉得这太搞笑了。等等，这真的太逗了。哥们儿，对吧？我的第二个故事是，最近有人跟我说，哥们儿，对我来说，最高的赞美之一大概就是有个女孩儿在街上随机问我要电话号码。
[00:31:39.680] And they were like, I wouldn't even care if like she wasn't really my type. I would remember that forever. And I would like love that. And I would definitely like talk to her more and like, you know, whatever. And I was like, wow, it just like kind of goes to show that like overall, you know, they still get less compliments than like women usually do. Yeah, that's so true. So I guess this is a public reminder to compliment the men in your life. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:39.680] 他们说，就算她不是我喜欢的类型，我也毫不在意。我会永远记住这一点。我会很喜欢。我肯定会想和她多聊聊，你知道的，诸如此类。我就想，哇，这说明总的来说，男性得到的赞美仍然比女性少。是啊，确实如此。所以我想这算是公开提醒大家，要多赞美你生命中的男性。没错，绝对是这样。
[00:32:08.440] I feel like they deserve it too, right? It's like kind of on a similar vein as you, Jisoo. I try not to hold myself back if I were like, oh, one of my guy friends has like cool shoes or whatever, like cool jacket, whatever. Usually they're like so happy to receive that compliment. It's like kind of nice to see too. I feel like the responses I've gotten from complimenting my guy friends has always been extremely hilarious.
[00:32:08.440] 我觉得他们也值得被夸奖，对吧？感觉跟你有点像，Jisoo。如果我夸我某个男性朋友的鞋子、外套什么的很酷，我都会尽量不克制自己。他们通常都会很高兴听到这样的赞美。看到他们开心的样子也挺好的。我觉得我夸男性朋友之后，他们的反应总是特别搞笑。
[00:32:36.900] Sometimes there's clear discomfort where I feel like they haven't been complimented in a long time or something. Or that's just my guess where they're like, oh, thank you. They're just like shook. Yeah. And then other times they're so overeager to share exactly where they bought the jacket and the story of finding it and all of that. And I'm like, oh, my God, this is turning into like a five minute story. But I kind of love it.
[00:32:36.900] 有时候，我能感觉到他们明显有些不自在，好像很久没被人夸过似的。或者，这只是我的猜测，他们会说：“哦，谢谢。” 他们可能真的有点懵。是啊。还有的时候，他们又特别热情地跟我分享外套的购买地点、购买过程等等。我就想，我的天，这故事要讲五分钟了。不过，我倒挺喜欢听的。
[00:32:59.160] Wait, that's so funny because don't you think there's low key like a girl code where it's like if you compliment a fellow woman's like, I don't know, dress or pants or like whatever. They're like, oh, my God, thank you. Like, I got it from here and here. It has pockets in it. Like, yeah, like I got it on sale. And you're like, oh, my God, that's amazing.
[00:32:59.160] 等等，这太搞笑了，你不觉得女生之间有一种不成文的默契吗？就是如果你夸赞一个女生的裙子、裤子之类的，她们会说：“我的天哪，谢谢！”然后她们会说：“这件衣服我是在这里和这里买的，它还有口袋呢。”她们会说：“是啊，我买的时候打折了。”然后你就会说：“我的天哪，太棒了！”
[00:33:24.060] Well, yeah, you're like obligated to share the price, the brand and like the pros and cons. It's like a short form review is immediately requested on the spot. Yeah, absolutely. So funny. Aside from compliments, do you have a go to move, Jisoo? I think my go to move has warped. I mean, back in high school, you read like Seventeen magazine and stuff. And it's always like laugh really hard when he says a joke and touch his arm.
[00:33:24.060] 嗯，是啊，你好像有义务分享价格、品牌以及优缺点之类的。感觉就像有人会立刻要求你写个简短的测评。对，没错。太搞笑了。除了夸奖之外，Jisoo，你还有什么招牌动作吗？我觉得我的招牌动作有点怪。我是说，以前在高中的时候，你会看《Seventeen》杂志之类的。然后每次他讲笑话的时候，我都会哈哈大笑，然后摸摸他的胳膊。
[00:33:54.100] And I was like, what do you mean touch his arm? Like how am I just supposed to naturally touch this guy's arm? But the last move, I guess, that I had was not really a move. I feel like it's just one of my personality traits, but it kind of worked. So I guess we'll call it an intentional move. But I have crazy dreams and it always features like a cast of everyone in my life. I never have mysterious people in my dreams. It's always like real people, like my friends, people I know, etc.
[00:33:54.100] 我当时就想，什么叫碰他的胳膊？我怎么可能自然而然地就碰他的胳膊呢？不过，我最后那个动作，我觉得与其说是动作，不如说是我的一种性格特征，但居然奏效了。所以我想，就把它称作“有意为之”吧。我经常做些奇奇怪怪的梦，梦里总是出现我生活中所有的人。我梦里从来不会出现神秘人物，都是些真实存在的人，比如我的朋友、我认识的人等等。
[00:34:25.180] So in freshman year of college, I had a dream about James and about like some other people in our school. And I texted him about it, which at the time he and I were like in our friend group, of course. But we didn't really text one on one. Oh, of course, our group chat was like always really active. But if you scroll through like our personal text message conversation at the time, it was like, hey, do you have this textbook? Yes, I'll send it to you.
[00:34:25.180] 所以，大一的时候，我梦到了詹姆斯，还有我们学校的其他一些人。我给他发了短信，当时我们俩当然都在同一个朋友圈里。不过我们平时很少单独发短信。当然，我们的群聊一直都很活跃。但如果你翻看我们当时的私人短信记录，你会发现类似这样的对话：嘿，你有这本教材吗？有，我这就发给你。
[00:34:54.480] You know, it was very like school related. So this day I woke up and I was like, holy fuck, I just had a dream about James. So I texted him and I was like, dude, I just had a dream about you. This happened, blah, blah, blah. And I just like told him my dream. And then he responded. After he responded, we just texted like that entire week, staying up till like 5 a.m. every night texting. Oh, my God. And that's like kind of what kickstarted our relationship.
[00:34:54.480] 你知道，这事儿跟学校里的事儿挺有关系的。那天早上我醒来，突然觉得，我的天，我居然梦到詹姆斯了。于是我给他发短信，说：“兄弟，我梦到你了。梦里发生了这些事，等等等等。”然后我就把我的梦告诉了他。他回复了。之后我们整整一个星期都在发短信，每天晚上都聊到凌晨五点。我的天哪。我们俩的关系就是这么开始的。
[00:35:23.680] I love this because I actually didn't know this. Oh, my God. Wow. But I do agree. That's a good move. I've had people tell me that I've been in their dream, girlfriend or guy friend. Right. It always feels slightly special, you know. You're like, oh, shit. Like I was in your dream. Like I was so important that you dreamed about me.
[00:35:23.680] 我喜欢这个，因为我之前真的不知道。我的天哪。哇。不过我同意。这招真不错。有人跟我说过，我出现在他们的梦里，可能是女朋友，也可能是男性朋友。没错。感觉总是有点特别，你知道吗？你会想，哦，天哪。就像我出现在你的梦里一样。就像我这么重要，你居然梦到我了。
[00:35:50.020] It doesn't have to be like anything necessarily like, well, I'm trying to date you or anything like that. But it's just like I'm so flattered that like I was important enough to be in your dream. So I do feel like that's like a good move regardless of if it's like a romantic gesture or not. It's just like, oh, shit. Like I've been thinking about you a lot. So you manifested in my dream. Actually, that's such a good point, too, because it is a very intimate thing, right, to like appear in someone's dream.
[00:35:50.020] 这不一定非得是什么暗示，比如“我想和你约会”之类的。只是，我感觉自己能出现在你的梦里，真的让我受宠若惊。所以我觉得，不管这算不算浪漫的举动，这都是个不错的举动。感觉就像，哦，天哪。我一直在想你。结果你出现在我的梦里了。其实，你说的也很有道理，因为出现在别人的梦里确实是一件很私密的事情，对吧。
[00:36:19.100] And in some ways, I guess depending on your dream. But in some ways, it's almost like I just watched a movie about someone, you know, featuring like all these people in my life. To be able to tell someone that I think is also kind of a little bit of vulnerability in a sense. I mean, most friends wouldn't be weirded out by it. But if I'm just hanging out with someone or if I just befriended someone, I obviously would hesitate to tell them because it could come off kind of weird.
[00:36:19.100] 在某种程度上，我觉得这取决于你的梦境。但某种程度上，感觉就像我刚看完一部电影，里面的人物都是我生活中的人。能把这件事告诉别人，我觉得也算是某种程度上的脆弱吧。我的意思是，大多数朋友不会觉得奇怪。但如果我只是和某人闲聊，或者刚认识了某个人，我肯定会犹豫要不要说，因为这可能会显得有点怪异。
[00:36:45.120] So to be able to tell someone that and to be able to come out in someone's dreams, like you said, I think is very special. For sure. For sure. OK, I have the final question for us. Has anyone ever walked in on you in the bathroom? So, yes. And I can think of one specific incident. I feel like there's probably other ones that I'm just forgetting. So freshman year, we went to a party. I think a bunch of our friends were there.
[00:36:45.120] 所以，能够告诉别人这些，能够出现在别人的梦里，就像你说的，我觉得非常特别。当然。当然。好的，我最后一个问题。有没有人曾经撞见你在洗手间？嗯，有。我能想起一件具体的事。我觉得可能还有其他的，只是我忘了。大一的时候，我们去参加一个派对。我想我们很多朋友都在。
[00:37:14.220] But from this night, I specifically remember James and my friend Jessica there. As you do during parties, I feel like it's very common for people to not pee alone. So Jessica and I were like, oh, my God, we need to pee. Like, let's go to the bathroom and pee. We went and then we were kind of like trading off the peeing. Sorry, that was really poorly. But, you know, she peed and then I was on the toilet. I was peeing.
[00:37:14.220] 但那天晚上，我特别记得詹姆斯和我朋友杰西卡也在。就像在派对上一样，我觉得大家一起上厕所很正常。所以杰西卡和我当时就想，天哪，我们得尿尿了。我们赶紧去厕所尿尿。然后我们就轮流尿。不好意思，我刚才说得不太清楚。总之，她尿完之后我就去马桶上尿尿。
[00:37:39.520] I guess because we were intoxicated, like we didn't lock the door or something. So James walks in on us and specifically me peeing because Jessica was not peeing at this time. And we're like, what the fuck? Like, get out of here. And we're just like freaking out. And it was like funny because we're friends. But it's also just like he really just walked in on me peeing. He was like, you guys need to hurry up. I have to pee so bad. So I was like, fine, fine. I finished peeing. And then we walked out.
[00:37:39.520] 我想是因为我们喝醉了，可能没锁门什么的。所以詹姆斯进来的时候，正好看到我正在小便，因为杰西卡当时没在小便。我们当时就懵了，心想：这他妈什么情况？赶紧出去！我们都吓坏了。这事儿挺搞笑的，因为我们是朋友。但同时，他真的就这么撞见我正在小便。他跟我说：你们快点儿，我憋不住了。我就说：行了行了。我尿完之后，我们就出去了。
[00:38:07.020] And me and Jessica were just dying laughing because it's hilarious, right? Since James is like a friend, like a trusted friend who we know isn't a pervert. Like it was more funny than it was like scary or anything. So we were just like laughing outside the door. And then when James finished and he came out, we for some reason all went back into the bathroom. Wait, I have a question. Yeah. At this time, were you and James dating yet? No. No. So we weren't dating.
[00:38:07.020] 我和杰西卡当时笑得都快岔气了，因为这事儿太搞笑了，对吧？詹姆斯就像我们的朋友，那种值得信赖的朋友，我们知道他不是变态。与其说是可怕什么的，不如说是好笑。所以我们就在门外笑个不停。然后詹姆斯完事出来之后，我们不知道为什么又都回到了浴室。等等，我有个问题。嗯。那时候你和詹姆斯在交往吗？没有。没有。所以我们当时还没在交往。
[00:38:34.920] We were just like starting to become friends, like closer friends. Yeah. So then we all went into the bathroom. And then we took like, I swear to God, we took like over 80 selfies. Like I have no idea why. But we have so many selfies. I'm fucking dying. Wait, I was definitely not here for this. I don't think you were. I think it was just like us three and then maybe like a couple of the guys. Which is so funny. Oh my God.
[00:38:34.920] 我们当时刚开始有点熟，算是比较亲密的朋友吧。对。然后我们就一起去了洗手间。然后我们拍了，我发誓，我们拍了超过80张自拍。我也不知道为什么。但我们真的拍了好多自拍。我快笑死了。等等，我当时肯定不在场。我觉得你也不在。我记得当时好像只有我们三个，可能还有几个男生。这太搞笑了。我的天哪。
[00:39:04.360] Actually, you're right. Because if you were there, you probably would have been in the bathroom with me and Jessica peeing together. Wait, so you have 80 selfies of you and Jessica and James just in the bathroom. I have, it's so many. Did anyone need to pee during those 80 selfies? I don't think so because it was like a frat house. So I think there were multiple bathrooms and stuff. No, no, I mean like out of you three. Did anyone need to pee? We're there for so long. We're like, oh shit, I gotta pee again.
[00:39:04.360] 其实你说得对。因为如果你当时在场，你很可能也会和我还有杰西卡一起在卫生间里小便。等等，所以你拍了80张你、杰西卡和詹姆斯在卫生间里的自拍？是的，真的好多。拍这80张自拍的时候有人想小便吗？我觉得应该没有，因为那地方就像个兄弟会宿舍。所以我觉得应该有好几个卫生间什么的。不不，我是说你们三个。有人想小便吗？我们在那儿待了那么久。我们都觉得，哎呀，我又想小便了。
[00:39:32.560] Someone's like holding it in and they're like, okay, for the selfies. For the greater good, aka the selfies. Dude, it was also funny because this frat house was really warm. It was just like a warm evening in general. You know, we had drank. So all of our faces in these photos are like bright red. But it's like the most unflattering selfies of all time. And I have like 80 of them. Do you still have them? I do.
[00:39:32.560] 有人憋着气，然后说，好吧，为了自拍。为了大局，也就是为了自拍。哥们儿，这事儿还挺搞笑的，因为这兄弟会的房子里特别暖和。那天晚上整体都很暖和。你知道，我们都喝了酒。所以照片里我们所有人的脸都红得像番茄一样。但这绝对是我拍过最丑的自拍了。我居然拍了80张。你还留着吗？我留着呢。
[00:40:02.260] Oh my God. Wait, that's so funny. You should show one at the wedding. Oh my God. That's so funny. Slip one in there. Damn, my story is not as funny as yours. My story happens like winter break or something during one of our college years. It might have been senior year because we were all 21 by the time. We all went to Vegas. It was pretty much all our high school friends.
[00:40:02.260] 我的天哪。等等，这太搞笑了。你应该在婚礼上放一个。我的天哪。这太搞笑了。赶紧放一个进去。哎，我的故事没你的好笑。我的故事发生在大学某一年的寒假，可能是大四那年，因为那时候我们都21岁了。我们去了拉斯维加斯。基本上都是我们高中时的朋友。
[00:40:31.560] There's two parts to this story. So my part is that we were staying at, I believe it was the Venetian. And we just got one suite and we were what, like maybe like seven or eight people. Oh my God. I know. It was like a two queen bed suite. But the thing about these suites is that the bathroom has no lock.
[00:40:31.560] 这个故事分为两部分。我这部分是这样的：我们当时住在威尼斯人酒店，好像是吧。我们订了一间套房，大概有七八个人吧。我的天哪，我知道。那套房是双床套房。但这些套房的问题是，浴室没有锁。
[00:40:58.960] So, you know, at one point I'm like, okay guys, I'm going to go shower. However, I'm showering. I finished showering. So, you know, there's no shower head, like water noise, right? So the door's just closed. You don't know for sure what whoever's in the bathroom is doing. I happen to just be stepping out of the shower.
[00:40:58.960] 所以，你知道，有那么一会儿，我就想，好了，我要去洗澡了。结果，我洗完了澡，洗澡的时候，没有淋浴喷头，也没有水声，对吧？门就关着。你根本不知道浴室里的人在干什么。我正好刚从淋浴间出来。
[00:41:22.800] And then our very good friend Tiffany fucking swings open the door. She's trying to go pee or some shit. And I'm just standing there, stare at the door as it swings open. I'm in shock. I'm like, what the fuck? And I'm like, oh my God, trying to cover myself. And she was like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. Slips door closed. Wait, did you have a towel to cover yourself?
[00:41:22.800] 然后我们那位非常要好的朋友蒂芙尼突然猛地把门打开了。她好像是想去小便什么的。我就站在那儿，盯着门打开的样子，完全懵了。我当时就想，卧槽，这到底是怎么回事？然后我就赶紧想办法遮住自己。她也说，我的天哪，真对不起。然后她赶紧把门关上。等等，你当时有毛巾遮住自己吗？
[00:41:52.360] No, I literally like just stepped out of the shower pretty much. Oh my gosh. I'm like literally so fucking naked. Like thank God it was Tiffany, like a girlfriend, right? Right. And I was just like, oh my fucking God. And she's like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. So slams the door closed. And then like, you know, I grab a towel, wipe off pretty much. And then I'm like, okay, it's fine. Like I can wrap myself in this towel. You can come and do whatever your business is.
[00:41:52.360] 不，我当时真的就刚洗完澡出来。我的天哪。我简直一丝不挂。谢天谢地是蒂芙尼，我的女朋友，对吧？对。我当时就想，我的天哪。然后她说，我的天哪，真对不起。然后砰地一声关上了门。然后，你知道，我抓起一条毛巾，擦了擦身子。然后我就想，好吧，没事。我可以把自己裹在毛巾里。你可以过来做你想做的事。
[00:42:19.440] It's also funny because I feel like I'm kind of more private about this. Like, you know how some girls are like really comfortable training in front of other like girlfriends and stuff. Right. I feel like I'm more on the like private side of that spectrum. Tiffany kind of is too. So the fact that it was like me fucking freshly stepping out of the shower. But ass naked. Yeah. And then her opening the door, we're both just like, holy fuck.
[00:42:19.440] 这事儿也挺搞笑的，因为我觉得自己在这方面比较注重隐私。你知道，有些女生很习惯在闺蜜面前训练什么的。对吧？我觉得我比较注重隐私。蒂芙尼也差不多。所以当时的情况是，我刚洗完澡出来，一丝不挂。然后她打开门，我们俩都惊呆了，心想：我的天哪。
[00:42:52.040] Wait, that's so funny because, okay, we're getting walked in on peeing. I feel like it's not the end of the world because your clothes for the most part, it's just like your ass is out. But shower is that's like you're so vulnerable. You're basically like a baby, you know, you're like wet. Your hair is wet. I'm pretty sure also it was like I was facing the door. Oh God. Because like also if you're sitting on a toilet, it's like sure your ass is out, but you're like sitting, you know? Yeah.
[00:42:52.040] 等等，这太搞笑了，因为，好吧，我们被人撞见小便。我觉得这倒不是什么世界末日，因为你的衣服大部分时候都露在外面，只是屁股露在外面而已。但是洗澡的时候就完全不一样了，感觉自己特别脆弱。你基本上就像个婴儿，你知道吗，浑身湿透，头发也湿漉漉的。而且我敢肯定，当时我正对着门。我的天哪。因为就算你坐在马桶上，虽然屁股也露在外面，但你是坐着的，你知道吗？嗯。
[00:43:21.840] Usually you're sitting position. Most things are covered. I was like facing the door. Like for a split second, Tiffany saw everything. Oh my God. Okay. This made me think of a follow up question. Would you rather get walked in on post shower or while you're shitting? Whoa. Honestly, post shower. Yeah. Yeah. Me too, I think. Post shower for sure.
[00:43:21.840] 通常情况下你是坐着的，大部分东西都被遮住了。我当时是背对着门的。就那么一瞬间，蒂芙尼把一切都看到了。我的天哪。好吧。这让我想到一个后续问题。你宁愿在洗完澡后被人撞见，还是在拉屎的时候被人撞见？哇哦。说实话，洗完澡后。是啊。是啊。我也这么觉得。肯定是洗完澡后。
[00:43:52.220] With a shit, you never know. What does that mean? What do you not know? You never know if it's like, like a smooth shit or if it's like you're running into some issues. You know what I'm saying? Okay. Also post shower, it's just visual. But during shit, there's also like, you know, you have like three of the five senses being
[00:43:52.220] 拉屎的时候，你永远不知道会发生什么。这是什么意思？你不知道什么？你永远不知道拉出来的是顺畅无阻的那种，还是会遇到一些问题。你明白我的意思吗？好的。还有，洗完澡之后，感觉就只是视觉上的。但是拉屎的时候，你知道，你的五感中会有三种都参与进来。
[00:44:22.720] employed. You're absolutely, if anything, post shower smells great. Yeah. Like you are having a wonderful time. No, honestly, if you think about it, post shower, it's like, it smells great. You're seeing a great human body, freshly clean. It's a good experience. Aside from the like awkwardness and shyness.
[00:44:22.720] 有工作。你肯定有工作，而且，洗完澡后闻起来很棒。是啊。感觉你过得很开心。不，说真的，仔细想想，洗完澡后，感觉真的很棒。你看到一个完美的人体，干净清爽。这是一种很好的体验。当然，除了那种尴尬和害羞之外。
[00:44:50.660] Wait, it's a good experience for what? The viewer or for both parties? For the viewer, I guess. Right. For the person on display, it's probably a little more like, oh my God, what's happening? But like for the viewer, smells great, looks great. That's true. There's one winner and one loser when someone gets locked in on post shower, but walking in during shit, that's two losers right there. Exactly.
[00:44:50.660] 等等，这到底对谁来说是好事？对观看者还是双方？我想对观看者来说应该是吧。没错。对被拍摄者来说，可能更像是“我的天哪，这是怎么回事？”但对观看者来说，闻起来很棒，看起来也很棒。确实如此。如果有人在刚洗完澡后被拍摄，那只有一个赢家和一个输家；但如果是在别人拉屎的时候闯进来，那可就有两个输家了。没错。
[00:45:20.620] Exactly. Exactly. Also, imagine if you're like getting walked in while you're pooping and you have a poop stool. Like that's even more awkward. The ankle and everything. Holy fuck. I'm sorry. I might've made it worse, but it's the truth. Poop stool, pooping is when you're most vulnerable for sure. Right. I think what would truly make it worse would be like if we had to poop naked or something.
[00:45:20.620] 没错，没错。还有，想象一下，如果你正在拉屎，而你用的又是便凳，结果有人走进来，那岂不是很尴尬？脚踝什么的都得小心点。我的天哪。抱歉，我可能说得更糟了，但这就是事实。便凳，拉屎的时候绝对是最容易受伤的时候。没错。我觉得真正更糟糕的情况应该是，如果我们必须裸体拉屎之类的。
[00:45:50.540] Oh my God. Dude, that actually just unlocked a memory. Do you remember when we used to wear like tight ass skinny jeans? Yes. I just remember sometimes when I'd be pooping in like middle school or something, when skin tight jeans were like a closet staple. Sometimes I would take off my jeans to shit. Oh, like you would take it all the way off? Yeah. Or at least like down to my ankles or something versus like with other pants, you don't necessarily
[00:45:50.540] 我的天哪。哥们儿，这简直唤醒了我的记忆。你还记得我们以前穿那种紧身牛仔裤吗？记得。我记得我上初中那会儿，紧身牛仔裤几乎是衣橱必备，有时候我拉屎的时候会把牛仔裤脱掉。哦，你是说你会把裤子完全脱掉？对。或者至少会脱到脚踝，不像穿其他裤子那样，你不一定非要脱到脚踝。
[00:46:18.460] have to go the full mile to have a comfortable poo. But because it was such restrictive like sausage casing days, I would like sometimes take it off. So that would be the worst scenario. Okay. Yeah, that's pretty bad. All right. Well, I feel like that was a bit of a whirlwind, but it was very fun and we are coming up on our time.
[00:46:18.460] 为了能舒服地拉屎，我得费尽心思。但因为它像穿香肠肠衣一样束缚，我有时候会想把它脱掉。所以那会是最糟糕的情况。好吧。是啊，那确实很糟糕。好的。嗯，我觉得刚才有点忙乱，但很有趣，而且我们快到时间了。
[00:46:43.380] Thank you, Jisoo, for joining me on this 200th episode and being vulnerable, getting a little drunk and looser than we usually are and releasing some like NSFW shit that we normally don't, right? I know. We got a little crazy this episode. We did. I mean, hopefully our listeners don't judge us too hard because some of this stuff I definitely would not share if I were sober.
[00:46:43.380] 谢谢Jisoo来参加这期第200期节目，感谢你这么坦诚，我们喝得有点多，比平时更放松，还聊了一些平时不会聊的少儿不宜的内容，对吧？我知道。这期节目我们玩得有点疯。真的。我的意思是，希望听众们不要太苛责我们，因为有些东西如果我清醒的话绝对不会说。

[00:48:15.360] Speaking of Spotify Q&As, shout out to Yashian Pan, who said, I have the same eye tear up thing. I thought it was just me. Dude, I feel so seen. Like, I'm so glad that it's not just me because I felt the same way. I thought it was just me. There's more of you out there. Oh, thank God. Another great response to do you have any tips for staying in the moment from Yufin, who said, I feel like meditation helps me personally to stay in the moment in a
[00:48:15.360] 说到Spotify的问答环节，特别要感谢Yashian Pan，他说：“我也有同样的眼眶湿润的问题。我还以为只有我这样呢。老兄，我感觉自己被理解了。我真的很高兴原来不止我一个人这样，因为我也有同样的感受。我之前一直以为只有我一个人这样。原来还有这么多人跟我一样。谢天谢地。” Yufin对“你有什么保持活在当下的秘诀吗？”这个问题也给出了很棒的回答，他说：“我觉得冥想对我个人来说很有帮助，能让我更好地活在当下。”
[00:48:45.300] way that I am now able to realize and self-reflect the moment I'm not living in the moment. I am always in awe of people who can keep up with their meditation. I feel like it's somewhat intimidating for me. So I love this response. Definitely inspiring. And it seems like it kind of frees you a little bit to enjoy the moment that you're in. So thank you, Yufin, for this great response. Thanks for listening. And don't forget to eat your crust.
[00:48:45.300] 我现在能够意识到并反思自己何时没有活在当下。我一直很佩服那些能坚持冥想的人。我觉得冥想对我来说有点难。所以我很喜欢你的回复。这真的很鼓舞人心。而且它似乎能让你稍微放松一些，从而更好地享受当下。所以，Yufin，谢谢你这么棒的回复。谢谢你的聆听。还有，别忘了吃掉面包皮哦。
