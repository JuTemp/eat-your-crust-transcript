[00:00:00.110] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal
[00:00:00.110] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。
[00:00:16.090] So we have a new Gen Z word today
[00:00:16.090] 所以，今天我们有了一个新的Z世代词汇。
[00:00:19.010] and I think it's a fun one because it's actually kind of like an
[00:00:19.010] 我觉得这很有趣，因为它实际上有点像……
[00:00:23.470] evolution of one of our first Gen Z words and
[00:00:23.470] 我们最早使用的Z世代词汇之一的演变
[00:00:26.870] One of those OG Gen Z words that we talked about is Riz which you know is kind of connected to like charisma
[00:00:26.870] 我们之前讨论过的那些Z世代常用词汇之一就是Riz，你知道，它和魅力之类的东西有点联系。
[00:00:33.590] So this new word Jeesoo actually brought today and it is also
[00:00:33.590] 所以，Jeesoo今天带来的这个新词，也是
[00:00:38.630] attached to the
[00:00:38.630] 附着于
[00:00:40.190] concept of charisma
[00:00:40.190] 魅力概念
[00:00:42.190] So the word is aura
[00:00:42.190] 所以这个词是光环
[00:00:44.270] Dude, aura is so funny
[00:00:44.270] 老兄，Aura 太搞笑了
[00:00:45.830] And it's one of those words where I feel like once you see it and you recognize that this new generation is using this slang
[00:00:45.830] 我觉得，一旦你看到这个词，意识到新一代正在使用这种俚语，你就会明白它的妙处。
[00:00:53.470] You can't unsee it. Like I've been seeing it everywhere on tik-tok and the format that I've been seeing it is
[00:00:53.470] 你根本无法忽视它。就像我在TikTok上到处都能看到它一样，而且我看到的格式是这样的：
[00:01:00.030] Usually it'll be some sort of compilation of things that make you unattractive or attractive and then they'll gauge
[00:01:00.030] 通常情况下，他们会列出一些让你显得没吸引力或有吸引力的事情，然后以此来衡量你。
[00:01:06.990] Points based on whatever that action is
[00:01:06.990] 根据该行为获得的分数
[00:01:09.150] So for example, it's like if you accidentally fall asleep in class and your head falls off your hand
[00:01:09.150] 举个例子，就像你上课不小心睡着了，头从手上掉了下来一样。
[00:01:15.030] Minus 1,000 aura. Oh my god
[00:01:15.030] 灵气值减1000。我的天啊
[00:01:18.270] Wait, I actually have not been seeing it used like that for me
[00:01:18.270] 等等，我其实还没见过有人这么用过。
[00:01:21.710] I've just kind of seen it being used as an alternative to vibes
[00:01:21.710] 我只是看到它被用作氛围的替代品。
[00:01:27.710] Yeah, so like oh this person has aura or to be fair I haven't seen it that much on tik-tok
[00:01:27.710] 是啊，就像这个人有气场一样，或者说实话，我在抖音上没怎么见过这种情况。
[00:01:33.490] But in the few instances that I have it's like oh
[00:01:33.490] 但就我遇到的少数情况而言，感觉就像是……哦
[00:01:36.910] Like what is this aura?
[00:01:36.910] 这是什么光环？
[00:01:40.070] I want to see like what the actual origin is because I think you're right
[00:01:40.070] 我想看看它的真正起源是什么，因为我觉得你说得对。
[00:01:44.430] Like there's probably multiple ways that people are using it
[00:01:44.430] 可能人们使用它的方式有很多种。
[00:01:46.750] It's just such a funny concept to me that you could assign points values or even if you're saying
[00:01:46.750] 我觉得给分数赋予数值这个想法很有趣，或者即使你是这么说的话。
[00:01:53.790] Oh, someone is really cool saying that aura is so creative. Yeah, I like it
[00:01:53.790] 哦，有人说Aura这个词很有创意，真是太酷了。嗯，我喜欢。
[00:01:59.350] It's very like it's almost sophisticated like Riz definitely feels like slang right?
[00:01:59.350] 感觉它很高级，就像 Riz 那样，感觉肯定是俚语，对吧？
[00:02:03.650] Like it's kind of a made-up word but aura is like a real word and it's like ooh, that's like kind of mystical
[00:02:03.650] “aura”这个词感觉像是编造出来的，但“aura”却是真实存在的词，而且感觉有点神秘。
[00:02:11.110] Yeah, I think mystical is the right word. It's spiritual. Yeah, I could almost see the person's energy transcending out of their body
[00:02:11.110] 是的，我觉得用“神秘”这个词很贴切。这是一种精神层面的体验。是的，我几乎能看到那个人的能量从他的身体里释放出来。
[00:02:17.830] Dude, yeah
[00:02:17.830] 兄弟，没错
[00:02:18.950] So I have found it on know your meme and it says
[00:02:18.950] 我在Know Your Meme网站上找到了，上面写着：
[00:02:24.310] Aura is the slang term popularized online in 2023 and 2024
[00:02:24.310] Aura是2023年和2024年在网络上流行的俚语。
[00:02:29.910] Often used to compliment men for their charisma or presence
[00:02:29.910] 常用于赞美男性的魅力或气场。
[00:02:33.990] The term first grew prevalent in soccer and basketball communities on
[00:02:33.990] 该术语最初在足球和篮球界开始流行。
[00:02:39.910] X-slash Twitter
[00:02:39.910] X-slash 推特
[00:02:41.430] Likely due to people commending Liverpool player van Dyke for his aura. Okay, I don't follow soccer
[00:02:41.430] 可能是因为人们称赞利物浦球员范戴克的个人魅力。好吧，我不看足球。
[00:02:48.470] So I can't really comment on this
[00:02:48.470] 所以我对此不予置评。
[00:02:51.510] And then it says jokes about gaining and losing aura points also notably spread on tik-tok in May
[00:02:51.510] 然后它还提到，关于获得和失去灵气点数的笑话在五月份也显著地在抖音上传播开来。
[00:02:59.470] 2024 dude, you are like on the forefront of this wave
[00:02:59.470] 2024年的老兄，你简直站在了这股浪潮的最前沿。
[00:03:04.710] Actually, you are cuz you know
[00:03:04.710] 实际上，你是，因为你知道
[00:03:06.850] Original way people use it and I've been only seeing it in the latest way
[00:03:06.850] 人们最初使用它的方式，而我只见过最新的这种使用方式。
[00:03:11.010] That's so funny though, but you're seeing like real time. It's we're still in May right now
[00:03:11.010] 真是太搞笑了，你看到的可是实时画面。现在才五月呢。
[00:03:16.930] Yeah, I dedicate a lot of time to research for this segment. Oh
[00:03:16.930] 是的，我花了很多时间研究这部分内容。哦
[00:03:22.610] Okay. So in this origin section, it says there was an article
[00:03:22.610] 好的。所以在这个起源部分，它说有一篇文章
[00:03:27.370] Way back from October 2020 that said Van Dyke's mistakes, dude
[00:03:27.370] 早在2020年10月就有人说过范戴克犯的错误，老兄。
[00:03:32.930] I actually don't even know if I'm pronouncing this guy's name, right? But hopefully I am
[00:03:32.930] 我其实都不知道我念对这个人的名字对不对，对吧？但愿我念对了。
[00:03:38.290] Van Dyke's mistakes can be dismissed because basically he has an aura. I guess that's the original article that
[00:03:38.290] 范戴克的失误可以被忽略，因为他基本上有一种光环。我猜这就是原文的意思。
[00:03:46.730] Started memes Wow
[00:03:46.730] 开始玩梗了，哇
[00:03:48.930] Huh, that's interesting
[00:03:48.930] 嗯，这很有意思。
[00:03:50.570] You would not think that this kind of stuff would come from a New York Times article
[00:03:50.570] 你肯定想不到这种东西会出自《纽约时报》的文章。
[00:03:54.370] Unless they were just using verbiage that fans were using on Twitter like prior or something
[00:03:54.370] 除非他们只是用了粉丝之前在推特上用的那些词句之类的。
[00:03:58.990] Yeah, and also it's like an older article so someone like dug this up and was like hey
[00:03:58.990] 是的，而且这篇文章也比较老了，所以有人把它挖出来，说：嘿
[00:04:05.190] We should start using this word now
[00:04:05.190] 我们现在就应该开始使用这个词了。
[00:04:08.190] My only beef with this word is I will say saying aura is I don't know how to say
[00:04:08.190] 我对这个词唯一不满的地方是，我觉得说“光环”这个词不太合适。
[00:04:13.990] It's like labor-intensive for my brain and my tongue
[00:04:13.990] 这感觉就像是在耗费我的大脑和舌头大量精力。
[00:04:16.750] It just doesn't feel like my tongue goes the right way to properly say it. Like I always want to be like
[00:04:16.750] 感觉我的舌头就是不听使唤，说不出那个词。就像我一直想说的那样
[00:04:22.030] Our or something. Oh, yeah, there's too many vowels in this word. Yeah
[00:04:22.030] 是我们的还是别的什么。哦，对，这个词里的元音字母太多了。嗯。
[00:04:26.910] confusing
[00:04:26.910] 令人困惑
[00:04:28.270] So this one gets like a B rating from me. I also
[00:04:28.270] 所以，这部作品我只能给B级评价。
[00:04:32.750] Whenever I think of this word nowadays, I think of like the aura ring, you know the like
[00:04:32.750] 现在我一想到这个词，就会想到灵气戒指之类的东西，你知道的，就是那种。
[00:04:38.310] Oh, yeah, the like health tracking right? Yeah
[00:04:38.310] 哦，对，就是那种健康追踪之类的，对吧？嗯。
[00:04:41.590] I think that's like the first thing that comes to mind because aura is not really like a super commonly used word
[00:04:41.590] 我觉得这大概是我首先想到的，因为“灵气”这个词其实并不常用。
[00:04:48.710] Prior to this meme so, you know once that ring came out, I was like, okay, that's like very notable, you know funny enough
[00:04:48.710] 在这个梗出现之前，你知道，当那个戒指出来的时候，我就想，好吧，这非常引人注目，你知道，这很有趣。
[00:04:55.590] I feel like growing up I heard the term aura more often in Korean than in English
[00:04:55.590] 我觉得我从小到大在韩语里听到“aura”这个词的频率比在英语里高得多。
[00:05:00.350] Because I feel like when I was growing up at least people would kind of use it a lot to talk about someone's vibes or energy
[00:05:00.350] 因为我觉得至少在我成长的年代，人们经常用它来形容一个人的气质或能量。
[00:05:06.670] Whereas in the US, I feel like if we were to talk about it, we would literally just use vibes and energy and not like aura
[00:05:06.670] 而在美国，我觉得如果我们谈论这个，我们只会用“感觉”和“能量”来形容，而不会用“气场”之类的词。
[00:05:12.310] Yeah, okay. Actually there is another place that I hear aura a lot
[00:05:12.310] 好的。其实我经常在另一个地方听到“灵气”这个词。
[00:05:17.230] I don't remember if I ever mentioned this on the podcast, but sometimes to go to sleep
[00:05:17.230] 我不记得我有没有在播客里提过这件事，但有时候为了睡觉
[00:05:23.510] I listen to like tarot reading videos on YouTube
[00:05:23.510] 我喜欢在YouTube上看塔罗牌占卜视频。
[00:05:30.190] So they say aura in there sometimes but you know, it's not in the in the slang slash meme way
[00:05:30.190] 所以他们有时会提到“aura”（灵气），但你知道，它不是那种俚语/梗的意思。
[00:05:37.230] You have like shifty eyes. Are you embarrassed about watching tarot card readings?
[00:05:37.230] 你的眼神有点闪烁不定。你是不是很不好意思看塔罗牌占卜？
[00:05:41.430] Don't be embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed, but I feel like with no context is very strange
[00:05:41.430] 别不好意思。我倒是不觉得尴尬，只是觉得在没有任何上下文的情况下这么说很奇怪。
[00:05:47.390] It's a little odd right because I'm not like into it
[00:05:47.390] 有点奇怪，因为我其实不太喜欢它。
[00:05:50.710] But usually people who make these videos have nice soothing voices
[00:05:50.710] 但通常制作这些视频的人都有悦耳动听的声音。
[00:05:54.910] It's like the perfect background noise because the videos are like an hour to two hours long
[00:05:54.910] 这就像完美的背景音，因为视频时长都差不多一到两个小时。
[00:06:00.150] So I just turn it on and then listen to it and doze off
[00:06:00.150] 所以我打开它，听着听着就睡着了。
[00:06:04.790] It creates the perfect aura
[00:06:04.790] 它营造出完美的氛围。
[00:06:08.670] Well auras aside we do have a pretty interesting topic to talk about today, which is decision-making
[00:06:08.670] 抛开气场不谈，我们今天确实有一个非常有趣的话题要聊，那就是决策。
[00:06:15.670] We really wanted to talk about the thoughts or elements that we use to help guide our daily decision-making
[00:06:15.670] 我们真的很想谈谈我们用来指导日常决策的想法或因素。
[00:06:21.630] whether it's big decisions or even small ones down to what kind of clothes you're gonna wear because I feel like sometimes
[00:06:21.630] 无论是重大决定还是穿什么衣服这样的小事，因为我觉得有时候
[00:06:28.590] Decision-making is an art and it is also
[00:06:28.590] 决策是一门艺术，而且
[00:06:33.350] laborious in some senses definitely, so let's talk about it today. Do you think you're
[00:06:33.350] 从某种意义上说，这确实很费力，所以我们今天就来谈谈这个问题。你认为你
[00:06:39.110] Primarily a decision maker or a follower
[00:06:39.110] 主要扮演决策者或追随者的角色
[00:06:42.590] So I think I kind of vacillate in between those two things. I feel like when I was younger
[00:06:42.590] 所以我觉得我在这两者之间摇摆不定。我觉得我年轻的时候……
[00:06:47.470] I was more of a decision maker. So even in a friend group, I bet oh, let's go do this
[00:06:47.470] 我更擅长做决定。所以即使在朋友聚会中，我也会提议：“哦，我们去做这个吧。”
[00:06:53.110] I felt like I had stronger thoughts and opinions maybe
[00:06:53.110] 我感觉自己好像有了更强烈的想法和观点。
[00:06:57.590] But going into my late 20s, I've been noticing that I am more of a decision-making follower now
[00:06:57.590] 但到了快30岁的时候，我发现自己现在更像是一个在做决定时倾向于跟随别人的追随者。
[00:07:03.830] So I tend to default to being a support position and let someone else make the bigger decisions
[00:07:03.830] 所以我倾向于扮演辅助角色，让其他人来做更重要的决定。
[00:07:11.910] Mmm. Well, I think I might be kind of the opposite of you. I
[00:07:11.910] 嗯，我觉得我可能跟你正好相反。
[00:07:15.910] want to say I was probably more of a follower when I was younger and then maybe now I
[00:07:15.910] 我想说，我年轻的时候可能更像个追随者，而现在也许……
[00:07:23.150] Make more decisions, but I think it's also like the nature of
[00:07:23.150] 多做决定，但我认为这也类似于……的本质
[00:07:27.470] Being an adult there's like certain decisions that you have more power over now versus like, you know
[00:07:27.470] 成年之后，你对某些决定的掌控力比以前强多了，你知道的。
[00:07:32.430] People telling you what to do in the past
[00:07:32.430] 过去那些告诉你该怎么做的人
[00:07:34.750] But if we were to think about like friend groups and stuff, I'm probably still more of a follower
[00:07:34.750] 但如果从朋友圈之类的角度来看，我可能还是更像个追随者。
[00:07:40.830] Yeah, it's interesting. I do feel like people kind of
[00:07:40.830] 是啊，挺有意思的。我感觉人们有点……
[00:07:44.350] Change and I'm sure certain time periods also affect the way we approach this as well
[00:07:44.350] 变化，我相信某些特定时期也会影响我们处理这个问题的方式。
[00:07:49.150] But I don't know
[00:07:49.150] 但我不知道
[00:07:50.390] I just feel like as someone who maybe used to decision make more often in the past
[00:07:50.390] 我只是觉得，作为一个过去可能更经常做决定的人，我现在的感受可能有所不同。
[00:07:55.270] there's just something so much more compelling about being a follower because
[00:07:55.270] 成为追随者似乎更有吸引力，因为
[00:07:59.910] Decision-making comes with a lot of responsibilities. I feel like once you take one kind of baton
[00:07:59.910] 决策伴随着很多责任。我觉得一旦你接过某种接力棒……
[00:08:07.150] Even if it's as a one-time thing, I feel like it's hard to
[00:08:07.150] 即使只是一次性的事情，我也觉得很难……
[00:08:11.230] Relinquish that power later on and it becomes expectations and you know
[00:08:11.230] 以后如果放弃这种权力，它就会变成期望，而你知道的。
[00:08:16.150] This is something that happens often in friend groups, but also in a workplace setting too
[00:08:16.150] 这种情况在朋友之间经常发生，但在工作场所也同样会发生。
[00:08:21.350] So then I think as someone who used to be more happy to make decisions
[00:08:21.350] 所以，我想，作为一个曾经更乐于做决定的人，我的想法是……
[00:08:25.150] I realized all the benefits that come with not being like the one person to do all that. Wait, that's so true
[00:08:25.150] 我意识到，不用一个人包揽所有事情，好处多多。等等，这话真没错。
[00:08:31.710] I feel like every time I
[00:08:31.710] 我觉得每次我
[00:08:33.790] Maybe like take charge in a group and make some decisions. It's like so stressful
[00:08:33.790] 或许可以尝试在团队中承担领导角色，做出一些决定。这真的太让人压力山大了。
[00:08:38.790] I'm always worried like oh my god, did I make the right decision? Is everyone going to enjoy the decision?
[00:08:38.790] 我总是很担心，天哪，我做的决定对吗？大家都会喜欢这个决定吗？
[00:08:44.510] It's hard to please everyone
[00:08:44.510] 很难让每个人都满意。
[00:08:46.830] Yeah, that's kind of like the natural thought I have like oh shoot. What am I gonna do if someone pushes back?
[00:08:46.830] 是啊，我脑子里自然而然就会冒出这种想法：糟了，如果有人反抗我该怎么办？
[00:08:52.110] Yeah, and I would instantly crumble
[00:08:52.110] 是啊，我会立刻崩溃。
[00:08:55.110] I feel like there's been so many times where I'm like, oh like this would be so fun
[00:08:55.110] 我觉得有很多次我都会想，哦，这肯定会很有趣。
[00:08:59.590] I have some idea and I go to rally the troops
[00:08:59.590] 我有些想法，于是去召集部队。
[00:09:02.430] Whenever I hit some sort of roadblock like maybe one person doesn't really want to do it or this person would prefer something else or
[00:09:02.430] 每当我遇到一些障碍，比如某个人不太想做这件事，或者这个人更喜欢做别的事，或者
[00:09:08.430] Like there's logistical things that come up. I'm like, why did I choose to put myself in this position?
[00:09:08.430] 比如，总会冒出一些后勤方面的问题。我就想，我当初为什么要把自己置于这种境地呢？
[00:09:13.390] And I think as someone who has anxious thoughts about does everyone hate me or whatever being the decision-maker
[00:09:13.390] 而且我觉得，作为一个会焦虑地思考“是不是每个人都讨厌我”之类的决策者，我可能会有这种感觉。
[00:09:19.790] Easily triggers that so then I learned why put yourself in a position where you're gonna trigger your personal anxieties, right?
[00:09:19.790] 很容易引发焦虑，所以我就明白了，为什么要让自己处于会引发个人焦虑的境地，对吧？
[00:09:26.830] True true. It's a lot less stressful to be a follower. So I commend every group decision-maker out there
[00:09:26.830] 没错没错。做追随者压力小得多。所以我赞赏所有参与集体决策的人。
[00:09:34.750] Yes, but when you do have to make these decisions
[00:09:34.750] 是的，但当你确实需要做出这些决定时……
[00:09:38.550] Do you have any like strategies because as we discussed it's like it's kind of hard
[00:09:38.550] 你有什么策略吗？因为正如我们讨论过的，这似乎有点难。
[00:09:42.590] So I guess it depends on the magnitude of what decision we're making but I'll start with something
[00:09:42.590] 所以我想这取决于我们所做决定的重要性，但我先从一些事情说起。
[00:09:48.110] That's bigger and maybe has more like potential consequences and whatnot
[00:09:48.110] 那件事影响更大，可能还会带来更多潜在的后果等等。
[00:09:52.510] so I am of the philosophy that
[00:09:52.510] 所以我信奉这样的哲学：
[00:09:56.190] Decision-making should run off the most risk averse path and also the path of least resistance
[00:09:56.190] 决策应遵循风险规避程度最高和阻力最小的原则。
[00:10:02.950] And I think that's actually probably
[00:10:02.950] 我认为这很可能
[00:10:06.110] controversial or not controversial, but I think a lot of people would have a different philosophy where you try to go for like
[00:10:06.110] 无论是否引起争议，我认为很多人会持有不同的理念，比如你会尝试追求……
[00:10:12.030] Optimizing profit or like optimizing gain essentially and not like minimizing risk
[00:10:12.030] 本质上是追求利润最大化，或者说收益最大化，而不是追求风险最小化。
[00:10:16.750] But I think for me and just the way my brain works
[00:10:16.750] 但我觉得对我来说，就我大脑的运作方式而言，情况就是这样。
[00:10:19.750] I have to before making a decision run through every single potential scenario in my head
[00:10:19.750] 在做决定之前，我必须在脑海中把每一种可能的情况都过一遍。
[00:10:25.510] And then that's what helps me guide my decision-making
[00:10:25.510] 然后，这有助于我做出决策。
[00:10:29.310] I think sometimes it's positive in the sense that I can really start to prepare for everything
[00:10:29.310] 我觉得有时候这是件好事，因为我可以真正开始为一切做好准备。
[00:10:36.150] That could potentially happen at least within my knowledge
[00:10:36.150] 至少据我所知，这种情况有可能发生。
[00:10:38.990] And then it makes me make a more nuanced decision versus just like I want to do this
[00:10:38.990] 然后，它促使我做出更细致的决定，而不是仅仅想做这件事。
[00:10:43.510] I'm gonna do it
[00:10:43.510] 我打算这么做。
[00:10:44.350] But I think on the flip side
[00:10:44.350] 但我认为另一方面
[00:10:46.190] It might mean that I don't necessarily challenge myself if I'm always going on the path of least resistance
[00:10:46.190] 这可能意味着，如果我总是选择阻力最小的道路，我就未必能挑战自己。
[00:10:52.790] Or the most risk averse path, so I think there's pros and cons
[00:10:52.790] 或者说，这是风险最低的方案，所以我认为有利有弊。
[00:10:57.550] But at the end of the day
[00:10:57.550] 但归根结底
[00:10:58.830] I think I just can't make a big decision without literally running through like the SWOT analysis of strengths weaknesses
[00:10:58.830] 我觉得我如果不认真地进行优势劣势分析（比如SWOT分析），就做不出什么重大决定。
[00:11:05.030] opportunities and threats of the decision
[00:11:05.030] 决策的机遇与威胁
[00:11:08.030] Interesting, but what if it's like the path of least resistance is
[00:11:08.030] 有意思，但如果它就像阻力最小的路径一样呢？
[00:11:14.230] Significantly less gain. I mean it's like weighted right? It's not like each thing is equal
[00:11:14.230] 收益明显减少。我的意思是，这就像是有权重的，对吧？并不是每件事都一样。
[00:11:19.150] So if there's something to gain and it's not too much resistance
[00:11:19.150] 所以，如果有利可图，而且阻力不大，那就没问题。
[00:11:24.670] I feel like it's still definitely worth pursuing
[00:11:24.670] 我觉得这件事仍然绝对值得去做。
[00:11:27.230] But I feel like to me it has to feel like a balanced decision
[00:11:27.230] 但我感觉对我来说，这必须是一个权衡利弊的决定。
[00:11:30.710] Like I'm not gonna just go chasing for the most high margin thing if the other factors don't make sense either
[00:11:30.710] 如果其他因素都不合理，我不会只追求利润最高的方案。
[00:11:38.150] Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I'm trying to think if I have a lot of
[00:11:38.150] 是的，我觉得很有道理。我正在思考我是否有很多
[00:11:43.310] Analysis in my decision-making
[00:11:43.310] 我的决策分析
[00:11:45.590] But I feel like sometimes I'm just like oh I need to do this. I'll just do it
[00:11:45.590] 但我感觉有时候我会想，哦，我需要做这件事。我就去做吧。
[00:11:49.430] Hmm, but it also depends because if it's like something you don't want to do then I'm kind of like
[00:11:49.430] 嗯，但这也要看情况，因为如果是你不想做的事情，那我可能就有点……
[00:11:54.670] Do I really need to do it?
[00:11:54.670] 我真的需要这么做吗？
[00:11:56.710] Can I put it off for longer?
[00:11:56.710] 我可以再推迟一段时间吗？
[00:11:58.990] But I think there are definitely moments where I
[00:11:58.990] 但我认为肯定有一些时刻，我会
[00:12:02.030] Don't think about it. I just like go for it
[00:12:02.030] 别想太多，我就是喜欢放手一搏。
[00:12:04.230] But I think those are usually like smaller decisions because you're right usually if it's like something bigger, there's definitely some
[00:12:04.230] 但我认为这些通常都是些小决定，因为你说的通常没错，如果是大事，那肯定还有一些需要考虑的因素。
[00:12:10.630] Planning or like pre-thought to it. So sometimes if it's like medium, I'll have pre-thought it like okay tomorrow
[00:12:10.630] 事先计划或考虑一下。所以有时候如果是中等难度，我会提前想好，比如明天就好。
[00:12:17.230] I need to do this and like these are the necessary steps just very generally from there kind of just like take action
[00:12:17.230] 我需要做这件事，这些是必要的步骤，大致来说，就是从那里开始采取行动。
[00:12:25.470] Dude, yeah, I always find it funny because you and I have very different approaches to decision-making
[00:12:25.470] 兄弟，是啊，我一直觉得这很有趣，因为你和我在做决定方面的方式截然不同。
[00:12:31.430] and I feel like a really stark example in my eyes is
[00:12:31.430] 在我看来，一个非常鲜明的例子是……
[00:12:36.350] New York. So I remember when you had initially told me you were gonna move to New York me and James spent some time
[00:12:36.350] 纽约。所以我记得你最初告诉我你要搬去纽约的时候，我和詹姆斯花了一些时间。
[00:12:44.350] Around a similar time period wondering if like we should move to New York as well
[00:12:44.350] 差不多同一时间，我们也在考虑是否应该搬到纽约。
[00:12:48.790] I think you decided you were kind of like thinking about it and then you decided in a really really short period of time
[00:12:48.790] 我认为你考虑了一段时间，然后在很短的时间内就做出了决定。
[00:12:55.630] And you were like, yeah, I'm just gonna do it
[00:12:55.630] 然后你就说，是啊，我就要这么做。
[00:12:57.870] I might have this friend check out some of the places there
[00:12:57.870] 我可能会让这位朋友去那里看看。
[00:13:01.070] But I think I'm literally just gonna like go and do it versus for me
[00:13:01.070] 但我认为我真的会亲自去做，而不是为了我自己。
[00:13:04.950] I ran like a whole almost like a multiple scenarios of like, okay for my five-year plan
[00:13:04.950] 我制定了一个完整的五年计划，几乎是多种方案的组合。
[00:13:11.710] If I were to move to New York
[00:13:11.710] 如果我搬到纽约
[00:13:13.390] How far would that push out our home buying process or how much would that set us back savings wise and what's the opportunity cost like
[00:13:13.390] 这会把我们的购房流程推迟多久？会让我们损失多少积蓄？机会成本又是多少？
[00:13:20.630] What am I gaining? And what am I losing from moving to New York?
[00:13:20.630] 搬到纽约，我能得到什么？又会失去什么？
[00:13:23.110] So you can see in our decisions you clearly moved to New York. I
[00:13:23.110] 所以从我们的决定可以看出，你显然已经搬到了纽约。
[00:13:27.430] You know thought about it with James ran through the numbers decided it did not make sense for me and James and our lifestyle
[00:13:27.430] 你知道，我和詹姆斯一起考虑过这件事，仔细算了算账，觉得这对我和詹姆斯以及我们的生活方式来说都不合适。
[00:13:34.310] I just find it so funny like the contrast of like my spreadsheets and then you're like, yeah
[00:13:34.310] 我觉得这太搞笑了，就像我的电子表格和你的表格形成鲜明对比，然后你会说，是啊。
[00:13:40.030] I'm gonna move and I'm gonna book like a moving pod
[00:13:40.030] 我要搬家了，我要预订一个搬家舱。
[00:13:43.790] Not to make light of your decision, but it's just like the approach is slightly different
[00:13:43.790] 并非要轻视你的决定，只是方法略有不同。
[00:13:48.270] No
[00:13:48.270] 不
[00:13:48.630] That's so true because a lot of the analysis that you just described that you went through
[00:13:48.630] 确实如此，因为你刚才描述的很多分析都涉及到了这一点。
[00:13:53.510] Happened after for me like once I moved back from New York. I was like, oh, yeah
[00:13:53.510] 对我来说，这事儿是在我从纽约搬回来之后发生的。我当时就想，哦，是啊。
[00:13:57.710] I guess like this kind of pushed some of these general timelines back and then I was like, hmm
[00:13:57.710] 我想这大概推迟了一些总体时间表，然后我就想，嗯……
[00:14:03.390] Oh, well, well, you know, it's already done. So this is just life now
[00:14:03.390] 哦，好吧，你知道，事情已经发生了。这就是现在的生活。
[00:14:06.510] I
[00:14:06.510] 我
[00:14:09.430] Feel like it's funny cuz
[00:14:09.430] 感觉挺搞笑的，因为
[00:14:11.590] Honestly running all the numbers and doing the analysis does have strong benefits and it's like soothing for me as a person
[00:14:11.590] 说实话，把所有数据都算一遍，做分析，确实有很多好处，而且对我个人来说，这就像是一种舒缓身心的方式。
[00:14:17.950] but then also I feel like if you go and you do it and you come back and
[00:14:17.950] 但我觉得，如果你去了，做了这件事，然后回来，
[00:14:22.790] You know, you are maybe like one or two years away from your goal or whatever doesn't really matter that significantly
[00:14:22.790] 你知道，也许你离目标还有一两年的时间，或者其他什么情况，其实都无关紧要。
[00:14:29.390] you know so then I think sometimes there is a trap if you're like a very anxious and like analytical person of falling into
[00:14:29.390] 你知道，所以我觉得有时候如果你是一个非常焦虑、喜欢分析的人，就会陷入一个陷阱。
[00:14:36.230] Analysis paralysis and then just being unable to move forward or make progress in any decision, dude
[00:14:36.230] 分析瘫痪导致无法推进任何决定，老兄。
[00:14:43.270] I feel that but also when you were thinking about that like, you know, New York decision
[00:14:43.270] 我也有这种感觉，但当你思考纽约的决定时，也会想到这一点。
[00:14:48.630] it was you and James so I feel like when it's two people and you have like a
[00:14:48.630] 是你和詹姆斯，所以我觉得当两个人在一起的时候，就像……
[00:14:53.590] Units timeline to consider it's a lot more to think about for me. I was like, okay
[00:14:53.590] 单位时间表需要考虑的事情太多了，我当时就想，好吧。
[00:14:58.350] Well, I have like not much to lose
[00:14:58.350] 嗯，我好像没什么可失去的。
[00:14:59.910] It's like just me out here and I think there were some pros that ultimately were like unique to me as well that helped push
[00:14:59.910] 感觉就像只有我一个人在这里，但我认为也有一些专业人士，他们最终也像我独有的方式帮助我取得了成功。
[00:15:07.510] the decision but I totally get the analysis paralysis thing a lot the number one example I can think of is
[00:15:07.510] 做出决定，但我完全理解那种分析瘫痪的感觉，我能想到的最典型的例子是……
[00:15:14.590] Sometimes and this happened a lot back in college
[00:15:14.590] 有时候，这种情况在大学时期经常发生。
[00:15:17.630] Dinner time would be coming up and I'd be like, okay. What should I eat for dinner?
[00:15:17.630] 晚餐时间快到了，我会想，好吧，我晚餐吃什么呢？
[00:15:21.030] Don't feel like cooking today cuz back in college. I like never cooked
[00:15:21.030] 今天不想做饭，因为还在上大学呢。我几乎从来没做过饭。
[00:15:24.870] So, you know sit down pull out my phone and like start scrolling through Yelp or like Google Maps or something
[00:15:24.870] 所以，你知道，我坐下来，拿出手机，开始浏览Yelp或者谷歌地图之类的网站。
[00:15:32.230] Just like scrolling through all of the different food options
[00:15:32.230] 就像浏览所有不同的食物选项一样
[00:15:35.510] And the craziest part is like we lived in the same place for like the whole time that we were in school
[00:15:35.510] 最不可思议的是，我们上学期间几乎一直住在同一个地方。
[00:15:42.270] It's like generally the same area. So, you know, I knew everything that was around us
[00:15:42.270] 基本上就是同一片区域。所以，你知道，我对周围的一切都很了解。
[00:15:47.470] Yeah
[00:15:47.470] 是的
[00:15:47.970] I'm still mindlessly scrolling through this list taking forever to think about what to eat. And then the next thing I know I'm like
[00:15:47.970] 我还在漫无目的地浏览这个清单，花了很长时间才想好吃什么。然后，我突然就……
[00:15:54.770] Oh shit, it's like 10. Everything's closed. I guess I'll just eat some bread
[00:15:54.770] 糟了，都十点了。所有店都关门了。看来我只能吃点面包了。
[00:15:59.210] Go to sleep. Oh
[00:15:59.210] 睡觉吧。哦
[00:16:00.850] My god that actually reminds me of something that I feel like I learned so late into my life
[00:16:00.850] 我的天哪，这让我想起了我感觉自己很晚才明白的一件事。
[00:16:06.770] But I think it's kind of obvious which is there are certain times
[00:16:06.770] 但我认为这一点很明显，那就是有些时候……
[00:16:10.570] You should be decision-making and certain times that you should not be using that brain
[00:16:10.570] 你应该在某个时候做出决定，但有些时候你不应该动用你的大脑。
[00:16:14.730] I feel like the biggest example, like you said is choosing food and whatnot
[00:16:14.730] 我觉得最典型的例子，就像你说的，就是选择食物等等。
[00:16:18.730] So if I leave all of like my weeknight meal decision-making for 6 p.m
[00:16:18.730] 所以如果我把所有工作日晚餐的安排都留到下午6点再做决定的话。
[00:16:24.810] After I'm done with work that day, I am eating out like I am door-dashing
[00:16:24.810] 那天下班后，我出去吃饭就像送外卖一样频繁。
[00:16:28.970] there's no way I'm able to make that decision but if I meal plan sort of ahead and
[00:16:28.970] 我根本没办法做出那个决定，但如果我提前做好膳食计划，
[00:16:34.730] I like have my grocery list set out and everything kind of ticks and ties to like, okay Monday
[00:16:34.730] 我喜欢把购物清单列好，这样一切都能按部就班地进行，比如，好吧，星期一。
[00:16:40.770] I'll eat this Tuesday. I'll eat that it's so much easier to do that
[00:16:40.770] 我周二会吃这个。我会吃的，那样做容易多了。
[00:16:44.410] And I was like, I can't trust evening me. I can only trust like Sunday me, you know
[00:16:44.410] 我当时就想，我不能相信晚上的自己。我只能相信星期天的自己，你知道吗？
[00:16:51.210] Like after work us is just a different different breed. I
[00:16:51.210] 下班后，我们就像完全不同的另一群人。
[00:16:56.570] Know I think same goes for like morning me sometimes too
[00:16:56.570] 我知道，我觉得有时候早上起来也一样。
[00:17:00.850] Outfits for example, I noticed that if I don't set out an outfit even if it's just like something really simple nothing crazy, right?
[00:17:00.850] 例如穿搭，我发现如果我不精心搭配衣服，哪怕只是非常简单、没什么特别的搭配，对吧？
[00:17:08.450] But if I don't set out like a workday outfit the night before in the morning, it'll take me like twice as long to pick
[00:17:08.450] 但如果我前一天晚上不把第二天早上要穿的衣服搭配好，挑选衣服的时间就会增加一倍。
[00:17:14.570] Even though I'll still probably pick the same outfit
[00:17:14.570] 虽然我可能还是会选择同样的衣服。
[00:17:17.290] Do sometimes when that happens and I'm in a rush. I'm like fuck. I'm just gonna wear all black today
[00:17:17.290] 有时候遇到这种情况，如果我时间很紧，我就会想：去他的，我今天就穿一身黑吧。
[00:17:25.610] It's kind of like that saying right where people say like you can't you can't grocery shop when you're hungry
[00:17:25.610] 这有点像那句俗语，人们常说饿着肚子不能去超市购物。
[00:17:31.690] You can't shop with an empty stomach, right? Right and I feel like that's so true
[00:17:31.690] 你不能空着肚子去购物，对吧？没错，我觉得这话太对了。
[00:17:36.250] I think that happens a lot, especially if you're like door dashing something or you know ordering something and you're like, oh, I'm hella hungry
[00:17:36.250] 我觉得这种情况经常发生，尤其是在你送外卖或者点餐的时候，突然感觉“哦，我饿死了”。
[00:17:44.210] Let me just you know order, you know this this extra side that sounds hella good right now
[00:17:44.210] 让我告诉你订单内容，你知道，这个额外的配菜现在听起来超级棒。
[00:17:48.930] Then it comes you're like wait, I can only a half of this food
[00:17:48.930] 然后你突然意识到，等等，我只能吃一半的食物。
[00:17:53.970] You're like who let me order all that
[00:17:53.970] 你就像是谁让我点了所有这些菜一样。
[00:17:56.450] And then the worst part is when like the food arrives your delivery person put like two sets of utensils in there and you're like
[00:17:56.450] 最糟糕的是，外卖送到的时候，送餐员竟然放了两套餐具，你就会想：
[00:18:04.170] Oh
[00:18:04.170] 哦
[00:18:05.690] Yeah, they were right and I was wrong
[00:18:05.690] 没错，他们是对的，我是错的。
[00:18:09.530] This is like why I think
[00:18:09.530] 这就是我为什么这么想的原因
[00:18:11.850] All the hot tips about decision-making come in in your late 20s
[00:18:11.850] 所有关于决策的实用技巧都会在你接近三十岁时涌现。
[00:18:16.790] Because I have let myself down many a times with poor decision-making
[00:18:16.790] 因为我多次因糟糕的决策而让自己失望。
[00:18:21.530] Agreed. I am also
[00:18:21.530] 同意。我也是。
[00:18:23.330] Although speaking of food, I remember you mentioned before that like at work
[00:18:23.330] 说到食物，我记得你之前提到过，就像在工作中那样。
[00:18:27.970] Sometimes you have to choose the meal for your team
[00:18:27.970] 有时候你必须为你的团队选择餐食。
[00:18:30.730] What you've started doing is you narrow it down to like two or three decisions and then you make everyone else
[00:18:30.730] 你现在的做法是，先把选择范围缩小到两三个决定，然后再决定其他所有事情。
[00:18:37.010] Kind of vote or like make the final decision and I feel like that is such a good
[00:18:37.010] 有点像投票或者做出最终决定，我觉得这样很好。
[00:18:42.450] Middle ground that way you can save yourself from like making the final most stressful
[00:18:42.450] 折中方案可以避免你把最终结果搞得压力最大。
[00:18:48.570] Part of the decision and you also get everyone else involved, dude
[00:18:48.570] 参与决策的同时，你也要让其他人都参与进来，伙计。
[00:18:53.010] I've been like musing about that recently though because I think the specific scenario that I mentioned that one time is in
[00:18:53.010] 我最近一直在思考这个问题，因为我觉得我之前提到的那个具体情况是……
[00:18:59.970] Workplace like corkers going out for lunch kind of setting but this kind of stuff happens with friends, too
[00:18:59.970] 工作场所里那种同事一起出去吃午饭的场景很常见，但这种事和朋友之间也会发生。
[00:19:05.850] whether it's one-on-one or in friend groups and I feel like because we're all just so
[00:19:05.850] 无论是单独相处还是和朋友聚会，我觉得因为我们都太……
[00:19:11.810] Labored with making decisions from nine to five like for a company every day
[00:19:11.810] 每天朝九晚五都在为公司做各种决定，真是辛苦了。
[00:19:16.690] I feel like not a lot of people want to do the decision-making anymore
[00:19:16.690] 我觉得现在很多人都不愿意做决定了。
[00:19:20.330] And I realized that sometimes it is just kind of easier to be like I want to try this place
[00:19:20.330] 我意识到，有时候最简单的方法就是说“我想去这个地方试试”。
[00:19:25.770] does it sound good instead of like doing the back-and-forth because
[00:19:25.770] 这样听起来是不是比来回沟通要好？
[00:19:29.370] That way if they don't want to eat it, they'll just be like, ah, maybe not
[00:19:29.370] 这样一来，如果他们不想吃，他们就会想，啊，也许不吃吧。
[00:19:33.770] I'm feeling this place if as long as they're comfortable saying that kind of stuff
[00:19:33.770] 只要他们能坦然地说出这类话，我就觉得这个地方不错。
[00:19:37.410] Mm-hmm
[00:19:37.410] 嗯
[00:19:37.930] And if they don't really care then you like chose something for them and then now they can just go there
[00:19:37.930] 如果他们真的不在乎，那你就替他们选个地方，然后他们就可以去那里了。
[00:19:43.370] So, I don't know
[00:19:43.370] 所以，我不知道
[00:19:44.290] I feel like you have to know your audience because I've had both strategies like not work
[00:19:44.290] 我觉得你必须了解你的受众，因为我尝试过两种策略，但都失败了。
[00:19:49.930] Depending on the person dang
[00:19:49.930] 取决于个人情况
[00:19:51.610] Have you ever offered a few things and then someone's just like I don't want any of that. I
[00:19:51.610] 你有没有过这样的经历：你主动提出好几样东西，结果对方却说“我一个都不要”？
[00:19:57.890] Feel usually it's like oh they all look good. Oh, like what do you want to eat?
[00:19:57.890] 感觉通常都是这样：哦，它们看起来都很好。哦，你想吃什么？
[00:20:02.450] And I'm like, oh I already sent you the three places that I want to eat out. You should pick
[00:20:02.450] 我当时就想，哦，我已经把我想去的三个餐厅发给你了，你选一个吧。
[00:20:08.410] But I think it's just you know
[00:20:08.410] 但我觉得这只是你知道的
[00:20:10.090] It comes with having people around you who are super nice and like they want you to feel comfortable and whatever
[00:20:10.090] 这得益于你身边的人都非常友善，他们希望你感到舒适等等。
[00:20:15.690] They're like, yeah, you just choose
[00:20:15.690] 他们会说，是啊，你只要选择就行了。
[00:20:18.450] Except you're like, I don't want to choose that's like the most painful sentence to hear. I know
[00:20:18.450] 但你会想，“我不想选”，这简直是世界上最伤人的话。我知道。
[00:20:24.610] Oh, but also like speaking of crowdsourcing decisions one funny thing that happens in our group chat
[00:20:24.610] 哦，说到众包决策，我们群聊里还发生了一件很有趣的事。
[00:20:31.250] Sometimes is someone will be like hey, what should I eat tonight or like what should I cook tonight?
[00:20:31.250] 有时候有人会问：“嘿，我今晚该吃什么？”或者“我今晚该做什么菜？”
[00:20:37.090] If people actually seriously respond. Yeah, it's so funny
[00:20:37.090] 如果人们真的认真回应的话。是啊，太搞笑了。
[00:20:41.050] The funny ones are like hey guys, should I eat Chipotle tonight and then it's like resounding yes from everyone
[00:20:41.050] 最搞笑的是，有人会问：“嘿，伙计们，我今晚要不要吃Chipotle？”然后大家就异口同声地回答：“好啊！”
[00:20:48.170] Dude, I know that shit is hella funny
[00:20:48.170] 老兄，我知道那玩意儿超级搞笑。
[00:20:50.170] I'm in this other group chat too
[00:20:50.170] 我在另一个群聊里。
[00:20:51.610] And sometimes if I really can't make a decision
[00:20:51.610] 有时候，如果我真的无法做出决定
[00:20:53.610] I'll make like a poll and this group chat is only two other people so it's hella funny because I'll just make a poll and
[00:20:53.610] 我发起个投票，这个群聊里只有我和另外两个人，所以特别搞笑，因为我只要发起个投票就行了。
[00:20:58.890] Be like should I eat a brownie or should I not?
[00:20:58.890] 就像在问：我到底该不该吃布朗尼蛋糕？
[00:21:02.610] We were back on the brownie
[00:21:02.610] 我们又开始吃布朗尼蛋糕了。
[00:21:07.050] You talked about brownies in the honeymoon
[00:21:07.050] 你们在蜜月旅行中谈到了布朗尼蛋糕
[00:21:13.770] Things in my brain
[00:21:13.770] 我脑子里的事
[00:21:18.690] Next time I see you I'll bring some brownies
[00:21:18.690] 下次见到你，我带些布朗尼蛋糕来。
[00:21:24.890] Wait, but also if the group chat is only three people does that ever mean that you have to tie break for your own decision?
[00:21:24.890] 等等，但是如果群聊只有三个人，是不是就意味着你必须自己打破僵局来做决定？
[00:21:33.490] Dude yeah, I'm always like this is so useless
[00:21:33.490] 兄弟，是啊，我总是觉得这东西太没用了。
[00:21:37.290] To make a poll in a group chat of three people and you are the third person
[00:21:37.290] 在一个只有三个人的群聊中发起投票，而你是第三个人。
[00:21:42.950] Back to square one. Oh my god. Wait, but also I think it's funny when there's like a poll made for a group
[00:21:42.950] 一切又回到了原点。我的天哪。等等，不过我觉得当有人发起投票的时候也挺搞笑的，尤其是在某个群体里。
[00:21:50.430] But then everyone's waiting for the first person to make like the first decision and then they're like, okay now I can put in my vote
[00:21:50.430] 但之后大家都在等第一个人做出第一个决定，然后他们才会说，好了，现在我可以投票了。
[00:21:57.910] Oh my god, or when it's like, oh we should hang out
[00:21:57.910] 我的天哪，或者当感觉像“哦，我们应该出去玩玩”的时候
[00:22:01.590] What weekend is everyone free and then the votes exactly split like half-half and it's just like okay
[00:22:01.590] 大家哪个周末都有空？然后投票结果正好五五开，就这样吧。
[00:22:08.750] Now I have to choose which group of people that I want to hang out like now it's actually worse because I have the knowledge
[00:22:08.750] 现在我得选择和哪群人混在一起，现在情况更糟了，因为我掌握了这些信息。
[00:22:16.030] the info
[00:22:16.030] 信息
[00:22:18.830] Ignorance is bliss
[00:22:18.830] 无知是福
[00:22:20.470] True, they should really create a way to outsource this like date choosing
[00:22:20.470] 没错，他们真的应该想办法把这种挑选日期之类的工作外包出去。
[00:22:25.710] Maybe even just a site where it's like hey, I want to have an event in May. Can you give me a random weekend?
[00:22:25.710] 或许可以建一个网站，比如，我想在五月份举办一个活动，你能随机推荐一个周末吗？
[00:22:31.790] Dude but speaking of RNG and like flipping a coin and stuff like that for
[00:22:31.790] 兄弟，说到随机数生成器（RNG），就像抛硬币之类的……
[00:22:38.150] Miami when we went to do our joint bachelor and bachelorette
[00:22:38.150] 我们去迈阿密举办了联合单身派对。
[00:22:41.230] James and I thought that it would be hella funny to make a coin where one side says James and one side says Jisoo
[00:22:41.230] James和我当时觉得，做一枚硬币，一面写着James，一面写着Jisoo，肯定特别搞笑。
[00:22:46.670] So sometimes we actually use it if we're like, oh I want wing stop, but he wants Chipotle
[00:22:46.670] 所以有时候我们真的会用到它，比如，我想吃Wingstop，但他想吃Chipotle。
[00:22:51.890] Well, like flip the coin and see oh my god. That's genius
[00:22:51.890] 就像抛硬币一样，看看结果，我的天哪。这真是天才之举。
[00:22:56.390] Do you ever reroll or reflip?
[00:22:56.390] 你会重新掷骰子或重新翻转吗？
[00:22:59.550] I'm like, I don't like this result
[00:22:59.550] 我心想，我不喜欢这个结果。
[00:23:02.550] You're like best out of five
[00:23:02.550] 就像五局三胜制一样。
[00:23:04.910] Dude, yeah, James is like very much. Okay. No, fuck this like best of X. Oh, we just keep rolling
[00:23:04.910] 兄弟，是啊，詹姆斯确实很棒。好吧。不，算了，这就像X的巅峰之作。哦，我们继续前进。
[00:23:11.110] And the next thing you know, it's 10 p.m. You're like, oh they're both closed
[00:23:11.110] 等你回过神来，已经晚上十点了。你心想，哎呀，两家都关门了。
[00:23:15.830] Time to sleep the crystal method
[00:23:15.830] 是时候用水晶法入睡了
[00:23:19.350] But honestly the crowdsourcing thing I
[00:23:19.350] 但说实话，关于众筹这件事……
[00:23:22.270] Sometimes do wonder if it is a result of people just having decision-making fatigue now because I've been noticing it
[00:23:22.270] 我有时会想，这是否是因为人们现在都出现了决策疲劳，因为我注意到这种情况。
[00:23:28.630] Slightly more often. I think it does allude to the fact that
[00:23:28.630] 频率略高一些。我认为这确实暗示了这样一个事实：
[00:23:33.070] Decision-making is hard
[00:23:33.070] 做决定很难
[00:23:35.590] It was definitely hard for different reasons for everyone
[00:23:35.590] 对每个人来说，这无疑都很困难，原因各不相同。
[00:23:38.350] So I guess what do you think is the hardest for you about making a decision?
[00:23:38.350] 所以我想问问你，你觉得做决定最难的是什么？
[00:23:42.790] Honestly, I think lately what I've really been noticing is like there's too many options in
[00:23:42.790] 说实话，我最近注意到的一点是，选择太多了。
[00:23:50.070] Everything in life, right? So food
[00:23:50.070] 生活中的一切，对吧？包括食物。
[00:23:52.770] There's like so many different restaurants around us that we have access to or like even shopping, you know
[00:23:52.770] 我们周围有很多不同的餐馆，我们可以去那里吃饭，甚至可以去那里购物，你知道吗？
[00:24:00.930] Before maybe there was one company that did one thing
[00:24:00.930] 以前可能只有一家公司只做一件事
[00:24:04.930] For example this one company sold webcams and they're like good
[00:24:04.930] 例如，有一家公司销售网络摄像头，而且质量很好。
[00:24:09.450] but now it's like there's so many if you just do a quick search you get like pages and pages of
[00:24:09.450] 但现在好像太多了，你随便搜一下，就会出现好几页。
[00:24:16.730] Basically the same product at varying price ranges and then you're just like oh my god, like what do I do?
[00:24:16.730] 基本上都是同一种产品，只是价格范围不同，然后你就会想，我的天哪，我该怎么办？
[00:24:23.890] how do I know which one's good and which ones like vetted or not vetted or
[00:24:23.890] 我怎么知道哪个好，哪个是经过审核的，哪个是未经审核的？
[00:24:29.010] If this really cheap one will work out
[00:24:29.010] 如果这款价格非常便宜的真的好用的话
[00:24:31.690] well
[00:24:31.690] 出色地
[00:24:31.970] or if I just like drop the extra money to get this like more expensive one and I feel like
[00:24:31.970] 或者，如果我只是想多花点钱买这个更贵的，我觉得
[00:24:38.130] All of that is just like I don't know. I guess it's like kinda, you know, the result of a capitalist
[00:24:38.130] 这一切都让我摸不着头脑。我想这大概就是资本主义的结果吧。
[00:24:45.370] Society
[00:24:45.370] 社会
[00:24:47.810] So we end up just with like hella options and then that results in a lot of decision paralysis
[00:24:47.810] 所以最后我们面对的选项太多了，导致很多事情都无法做出决定。
[00:24:54.130] That's a really good point. What I've been noticing lately, too is I don't know if it's just the way
[00:24:54.130] 你说得很有道理。我最近也注意到，我不知道这是否只是某种原因。
[00:25:01.250] the tick-tock algorithm works or
[00:25:01.250] 滴答算法有效或
[00:25:04.010] Just how we've evolved as a society under like all these different
[00:25:04.010] 我们作为一个社会，在所有这些不同的背景下是如何演变的呢？
[00:25:09.250] Options that look so shiny and new to us, but I feel like every time I'm scrolling down tick-tock there's like oh
[00:25:09.250] 那些看起来光鲜亮丽、新颖别致的选项，我感觉每次我滑动屏幕浏览时，都会出现一些让人失望的东西。
[00:25:15.410] Here's what you're doing wrong about credit card points
[00:25:15.410] 以下是你对信用卡积分的误解
[00:25:18.370] Like here's what you're doing wrong about booking this flight and like there's all these secret tips and tricks because there's so much
[00:25:18.370] 比如，你订机票的时候犯了这么多错误，还有很多秘诀和技巧，因为信息量实在太大了。
[00:25:25.370] Information out there and now I feel like I can't make a decision as easy as like what credit card should I open or like?
[00:25:25.370] 现在信息太多，我觉得我无法像做决定一样轻松地做出选择，比如我应该开哪张信用卡？
[00:25:32.590] When should I book this flight?
[00:25:32.590] 我应该何时预订这趟航班？
[00:25:34.290] Because everyone left and right is claiming that they have like the hot new tech and I feel like it gives you like
[00:25:34.290] 因为每个人都声称自己拥有热门的新科技，我觉得这会让你感觉……
[00:25:42.250] Almost like a sense of FOMO, you know because before back in my parents days
[00:25:42.250] 感觉就像一种错失恐惧症（FOMO），你知道吗？因为在我父母那一代的时候，情况就不同了。
[00:25:47.090] I'm sure they also had tips and tricks and stuff
[00:25:47.090] 我相信他们肯定也有一些技巧和窍门之类的东西。
[00:25:49.530] But it was probably kind of like if you know, you know, but if not, no one's gonna be like
[00:25:49.530] 但这可能有点像，如果你知道，你自然就知道；但如果不知道，就没人会知道。
[00:25:53.550] Oh, why'd you get that thing or like? Why'd you book that one?
[00:25:53.550] 哦，你为什么买那东西？或者说，你为什么预订了那辆车？
[00:25:57.130] Well, I think it's more just like oh, you know, the default is that everyone does it the standard way
[00:25:57.130] 嗯，我觉得更像是，你知道，默认的做法是大家都按标准方式来做。
[00:26:01.490] Maybe some people know it the other way. But now I'm just kind of like there's too much information out there and
[00:26:01.490] 也许有些人知道的恰恰相反。但我现在觉得，信息太多了，而且
[00:26:06.850] The way it's being presented is like in a almost judgmental manner
[00:26:06.850] 它呈现的方式几乎带有评判的意味。
[00:26:11.730] That also makes me not want to like decide anything
[00:26:11.730] 这也让我更不想做任何决定。
[00:26:14.850] Yeah, it's kind of like what we said earlier where we ask everyone like hey, which weekend are you free?
[00:26:14.850] 对，就像我们之前说的那样，我们会问每个人，嘿，你哪个周末有空？
[00:26:20.450] And then we're like, oh shoot now
[00:26:20.450] 然后我们就想，哦，糟了
[00:26:22.410] I have too much information because now the decision-making feels bad because I know I'm gonna exclude someone it's almost like that right
[00:26:22.410] 我掌握的信息太多了，现在做决定感觉很糟糕，因为我知道我肯定会排除掉某些人，感觉就像这样，对吧？
[00:26:29.130] It's like oh shoot now. I have so much information. It's actually harder to make the decision
[00:26:29.130] 感觉就像“糟了”，我掌握了太多信息，反而更难做决定了。
[00:26:34.490] Yeah, that's definitely true. I feel like it's also intimidating too
[00:26:34.490] 没错，确实如此。我也觉得挺吓人的。
[00:26:38.490] You're like faced with this plethora of info and it's like I'm very grateful to have this
[00:26:38.490] 你面对着海量的信息，感觉就像在说“我很感激能拥有这些信息”。
[00:26:44.850] Accessible but at the same time it's like I have to comb through all of this after
[00:26:44.850] 虽然容易获取，但同时又感觉我之后还得仔细梳理一遍。
[00:26:50.210] Spending energy and time to learn it all then I have to make another decision
[00:26:50.210] 花费时间和精力学习了所有这些之后，我又得做出另一个决定。
[00:26:55.470] I know and I feel like also with social media and just you know, not everyone posts often on Instagram stories or whatever
[00:26:55.470] 我知道，我也觉得社交媒体就是这样，你知道，不是每个人都经常在Instagram Stories之类的平台上发帖。
[00:27:02.690] But I feel like a lot of people do post on the daily
[00:27:02.690] 但我感觉很多人都会每天发帖。
[00:27:05.030] I feel like you just see so much of what someone does every day
[00:27:05.030] 我觉得你每天都能看到别人做很多事情。
[00:27:09.550] Even if you're not the type of person to let it affect you like I feel like you still kind of think about it
[00:27:09.550] 即使你不是那种会受其影响的人，我觉得你还是会时不时地想起这件事。
[00:27:13.890] Sometimes and it just feels like my brain is being like overloaded all the time
[00:27:13.890] 有时候，我感觉我的大脑一直处于超负荷运转的状态。
[00:27:18.870] Yeah, and I feel like that just results in feelings of being overwhelmed
[00:27:18.870] 是的，我觉得那样只会让人感到不知所措。
[00:27:24.070] Personally if I'm overwhelmed whether I realize it or not, I just end up like lying in bed. I know
[00:27:24.070] 就我个人而言，如果我压力过大，不管我是否意识到，最后都会只想躺在床上。我知道
[00:27:30.350] I think I feel like the hardest to when say on one day
[00:27:30.350] 我觉得最难的是，比如说有一天……
[00:27:33.870] I have multiple important tasks to do and all of them are like at least in my eyes weighted equally
[00:27:33.870] 我有很多重要的任务要做，而且在我看来，它们的重要性都差不多。
[00:27:39.630] I feel like I just can't choose which one to do first
[00:27:39.630] 我感觉自己根本无法决定先做哪一个。
[00:27:44.870] Mm-hmm, and then that means I just don't do any of them dude
[00:27:44.870] 嗯，那岂不是说我一个都不做？
[00:27:48.150] Yeah, as people say the hardest part is to start true
[00:27:48.150] 是的，正如人们所说，最难的是开始。
[00:27:52.030] I actually saw this one like I think it was a tick-tock and it's not quite like decision-making
[00:27:52.030] 我看到这个的时候，感觉就像在看时间滴答作响，但这跟做决定不太一样。
[00:27:58.350] But it kind of reminds me of what we've been talking about
[00:27:58.350] 但这让我想起了我们一直在讨论的话题。
[00:28:01.990] Basically, the woman was saying like I'm tired of always getting ready for stuff
[00:28:01.990] 基本上，那女人是这么说的：我厌倦了总是要准备各种事情。
[00:28:07.390] She listed out like a bunch of things that we get ready for that
[00:28:07.390] 她列出了一大堆我们需要准备的东西。
[00:28:11.270] I like didn't even realize we get ready for so she was saying like I have to you know
[00:28:11.270] 我甚至都没意识到我们要准备什么，所以她就说，我得……你知道的
[00:28:16.110] Wake up and get ready for the day
[00:28:16.110] 起床，准备开始新的一天
[00:28:17.950] so, you know like wash your face brush your teeth put on your face all that kind of stuff and then like get ready to
[00:28:17.950] 所以，你知道，就像洗脸、刷牙、涂药水之类的，然后准备……
[00:28:24.150] Like go to the office
[00:28:24.150] 比如去办公室
[00:28:26.430] Packing up all your stuff get ready to eat lunch
[00:28:26.430] 收拾好东西，准备吃午饭吧。
[00:28:29.030] You know
[00:28:29.030] 你知道
[00:28:29.390] You have to like pack your lunch if you do that or make the decision of like where to go eat
[00:28:29.390] 如果你那样做，就得自己带午餐，或者决定去哪里吃饭。
[00:28:33.990] Get ready to like just leave the house is like a whole thing in itself to like making sure you have everything
[00:28:33.990] 出门前的准备工作本身就是一件大事，要确保带齐所有东西。
[00:28:40.950] And then the one that like shook me to my core was
[00:28:40.950] 然后，有一件事彻底震撼了我。
[00:28:44.990] Getting ready for bed like you have to get ready to go to bed, right?
[00:28:44.990] 像你必须准备睡觉那样准备睡觉，对吧？
[00:28:50.110] That's crazy, right? How much of our daily life is just transition timing like we're waiting to do something else
[00:28:50.110] 是不是很疯狂？我们日常生活中有多少时间其实只是在等待时机去做其他事情？
[00:28:56.750] Yeah, and it's all just like in a sense. It's kind of like decision-making
[00:28:56.750] 是的，从某种意义上说，这一切都像是在做决定。
[00:29:00.910] It's like oh if I'm gonna make the decision to like leave the house
[00:29:00.910] 就好像，哦，如果我要决定离开家……
[00:29:04.110] I have to get ready to do that and it's like kind of
[00:29:04.110] 我得做好准备去做那件事，感觉就像……
[00:29:06.830] tied to what we were talking about early like planning to like get this thing done and
[00:29:06.830] 这和我们之前讨论的计划有关，比如如何完成这件事。
[00:29:11.350] Then kind of also thinking about what comes after that too. I'm like, whoa we do a lot. I
[00:29:11.350] 然后我也开始思考接下来会发生什么。我就想，哇，我们要做很多事。
[00:29:17.590] Think another theory that I have is I guess even using something like a smartphone
[00:29:17.590] 我还有另一个想法，那就是，我猜即使是使用像智能手机这样的设备。
[00:29:23.390] You're just making so many decisions constantly and I've been noticing this lately and it's starting to freak me out a little bit because I feel
[00:29:23.390] 你一直在不停地做决定，我最近注意到这一点，这让我有点担心，因为我觉得
[00:29:30.390] Like I'm truly having a phone addiction moment
[00:29:30.390] 感觉我真的有点手机上瘾了。
[00:29:33.630] But sometimes I will unlock my phone and then mindlessly open and close each app
[00:29:33.630] 但有时我会解锁手机，然后漫不经心地打开和关闭每个应用程序。
[00:29:40.830] Like, you know how you like it wake up in the morning
[00:29:40.830] 就像，你知道你喜欢早上怎样醒来。
[00:29:43.170] You're like, okay check mail
[00:29:43.170] 你会想，好吧，查收邮件。
[00:29:44.550] Look at your text look at your messenger and then scroll through tick-tock a little bit and get up or whatever
[00:29:44.550] 看看你的短信，看看你的聊天软件，然后稍微滑动一下屏幕，起床或者干点别的什么。
[00:29:49.270] Like there's some sort of routine, right? I noticed that sometimes if I'm really like brain off
[00:29:49.270] 好像有什么固定的模式，对吧？我注意到有时候如果我真的完全放空大脑，就会出现这种情况。
[00:29:54.230] I'll be looping through it
[00:29:54.230] 我会反复检查它。
[00:29:55.750] So like I'll open mail again or like I'll open tick-tock close it and be like, oh look at something else
[00:29:55.750] 所以，就像我会再次打开邮件，或者像我会打开滴答滴答的邮件，然后关上，然后说，哦，看看别的东西。
[00:30:00.550] Look at that and I go back to tick-tock and I'm like wait
[00:30:00.550] 瞧瞧，然后我又开始数着时间，心想：等等
[00:30:02.990] I was just on the inside and even though these things are like split second decision making and it's like
[00:30:02.990] 我当时就在里面，虽然这些事情都需要瞬间做出决定，而且感觉就像……
[00:30:08.910] Probably more so muscle memory that it is like active decision-making
[00:30:08.910] 或许更像是肌肉记忆，而不是主动决策。
[00:30:12.470] I feel like maybe your brain would probably count that as like a half-seas decision or something
[00:30:12.470] 我觉得你的大脑可能会把这算作一个半吊子的决定之类的。
[00:30:17.430] And maybe that's why at 5 p.m. I'm like, I can't choose what to eat
[00:30:17.430] 也许这就是为什么到了下午五点，我会不知道该吃什么的原因吧。
[00:30:23.270] I've definitely felt that too when you're just like autopiloting and you're like wait
[00:30:23.270] 我也有过这种感觉，就像自动驾驶一样，然后你会想：等等！
[00:30:27.350] I need to go do something and then you're like, okay, let me get up and they're like, oh wait
[00:30:27.350] 我得去办点事，然后你就说，好吧，让我起来，他们就说，哦，等等
[00:30:32.110] Why am I back here on my phone? Right?
[00:30:32.110] 我为什么又回到这里玩手机了？对吧？
[00:30:34.910] Well besides these more difficult moments of decision-making and I guess like finding activation energy
[00:30:34.910] 除了这些更艰难的决策时刻，比如寻找活化能之外，还有其他一些事情需要克服。
[00:30:42.110] Is there anything that you know for sure is like a quick and easy decision for you?
[00:30:42.110] 有没有什么事情是你确信可以快速轻松地做出决定的？
[00:30:53.820] What about like liking a video whoa, do you like videos no
[00:30:53.820] 那你喜欢点赞视频吗？哇，你喜欢看视频吗？不喜欢。
[00:31:00.940] I guess that decision is easy. Oh you don't like videos, too
[00:31:00.940] 我想这个决定很容易。哦，你也不喜欢视频啊。
[00:31:06.780] wait, that's so cool because one time I
[00:31:06.780] 等等，这太酷了，因为有一次我
[00:31:09.020] Saw someone scrolling through like reels or tik-tok or something and they're like scroll double tap scroll scroll double tap
[00:31:09.020] 看到有人在刷 Reels 或 TikTok 之类的视频，然后他们就一直滑动屏幕，双击滑动屏幕，双击滑动屏幕。
[00:31:15.340] And I was like, well you like videos and then they're like, oh you don't I was like no it's like against my
[00:31:15.340] 我当时就说，你们喜欢视频，然后他们说，哦，你不喜欢啊。我说，不，这跟我的想法完全相反。
[00:31:23.300] values I
[00:31:23.300] 价值观
[00:31:26.380] Just cannot if I accidentally hit like I will unlike and then if I'm like scrolling through the comments and I accidentally like
[00:31:26.380] 如果我不小心点了赞，就会取消点赞；然后我浏览评论的时候又不小心点了赞，那就麻烦了。
[00:31:33.460] Thumbs up or thumbs down someone's comment
[00:31:33.460] 对某人的评论点赞或踩
[00:31:36.220] I will immediately fix that to back to neutral like same with reddit for example or like YouTube
[00:31:36.220] 我会立即将其恢复到中立状态，就像 Reddit 或 YouTube 那样。
[00:31:42.460] Like I never like videos or comments or anything like that. If I do I like immediately undo it. Oh
[00:31:42.460] 我从来不点赞视频、评论之类的。如果点了，我会立刻取消。
[00:31:50.940] Okay, I think that's actually very similar to James he has like a zero like policy if you go on his profile
[00:31:50.940] 好吧，我觉得这其实跟詹姆斯很像，如果你去看看他的个人资料，就会发现他好像只点赞不绝口。
[00:31:57.380] He wants to make sure that it says zero under like liked videos, but for me, I'm more flexible
[00:31:57.380] 他想确保“点赞数”下方显示为零，但我个人比较灵活。
[00:32:02.620] But it's very rare that I'll like stuff like I'll only give it to the people who really did it
[00:32:02.620] 但我很少会喜欢这样的东西，我只会把它送给真正为此付出努力的人。
[00:32:07.340] I'm like, this is so fucking fire. Like you deserve a like
[00:32:07.340] 我心想，这简直太他妈牛逼了。你值得点赞。
[00:32:11.660] So that is a decision you make I guess that's true and it feels more intuitive
[00:32:11.660] 所以这确实是你自己做出的决定，而且感觉也更符合直觉。
[00:32:17.460] Maybe because it feels light-hearted and not
[00:32:17.460] 或许是因为它感觉轻松愉快，而不是
[00:32:20.260] any substance or consequence
[00:32:20.260] 任何物质或后果
[00:32:23.340] Associated I guess the other thing but I do find easy to make in terms of decisions is with social
[00:32:23.340] 我想还有一点相关的是，我发现做决定很容易，那就是社交。
[00:32:31.100] Situations I think for the most part if someone is visiting from out of town
[00:32:31.100] 我认为大多数情况下，如果有人是从外地来访的。
[00:32:35.460] Who wants to catch up or you're just like seeing someone you haven't seen in a long time, etc
[00:32:35.460] 谁想叙叙旧，还是只是像见到很久没见的老朋友一样，等等。
[00:32:39.500] I think I'm always more than happy to do that
[00:32:39.500] 我觉得我总是非常乐意这样做。
[00:32:41.780] The only difficult part about that era of decision-making is the scheduling aspect
[00:32:41.780] 那个时代决策过程中唯一困难的地方在于时间安排方面。
[00:32:47.540] But I feel like in terms of wanting to go and see that person. My mind is always down
[00:32:47.540] 但就想见那个人这件事而言，我总是犹豫不决。
[00:32:51.820] I'm always like yay nice. I think a quick and easy decision for me is if I'm craving something
[00:32:51.820] 我总是会觉得“太好了”。我觉得对我来说，最快捷简单的决定就是看我是否想吃什么。
[00:32:59.580] Food bias if I know I like really want to eat something
[00:32:59.580] 如果我知道自己喜欢某种食物，我就会特别想吃它。
[00:33:03.260] I will make it a mission to do it to succeed
[00:33:03.260] 我将全力以赴，争取成功。
[00:33:07.140] I feel like similarly to if I have a recipe I really want to try out
[00:33:07.140] 我觉得这就像我有一个很想尝试的食谱一样。
[00:33:12.340] I'm like, I will go and get this and like make this this weekend something like that. Yeah, I guess like
[00:33:12.340] 我当时就想，我要去买这个，然后这个周末就做点类似的事情。嗯，我想就是这样。
[00:33:19.460] the thing about like these easier or quick decisions for me is like the
[00:33:19.460] 对我来说，像这样更容易或更快捷的决定，关键在于……
[00:33:25.380] Gain is so high
[00:33:25.380] 收益如此之高
[00:33:27.660] That the loss is like negligible so I guess that you know, for example, like if you're craving a certain food, it's like, okay
[00:33:27.660] 损失微乎其微，所以我想你知道，比如说，如果你特别想吃某种食物，那就没关系。
[00:33:34.300] well, I have to like get ready to get out, but honestly, that's nothing in comparison to like the satisfaction of like, you know,
[00:33:34.300] 嗯，我得准备离开，但说实话，这跟那种满足感比起来根本不算什么，你知道的。
[00:33:41.860] Satisfying that craving right? And I think this can kind of be applied to other areas in life, too
[00:33:41.860] 满足这种渴望，对吧？我觉得这也可以应用到生活的其他方面。
[00:33:49.260] But maybe not as like
[00:33:49.260] 但也许不像
[00:33:51.740] Obviously, but I think at work on average
[00:33:51.740] 当然，但我认为在工作中平均而言
[00:33:54.420] I'm like not a huge decision maker one because I am on like the lower end of the
[00:33:54.420] 我不太擅长做决定，因为我的能力比较弱。
[00:34:02.380] Management chain. So usually I don't really have to make that many decisions in terms of I don't know
[00:34:02.380] 管理链。所以通常情况下，我不需要做太多决定，我不知道。
[00:34:07.580] I guess like managing or like time managing that kind of stuff other than for like literally just myself
[00:34:07.580] 我猜就像管理或者时间管理之类的事情，除了纯粹为了我自己之外。
[00:34:13.820] But what I've started to kind of realize is that if you step up and like take control
[00:34:13.820] 但我开始慢慢意识到，如果你挺身而出，掌控局面，情况就会有所改观。
[00:34:20.220] I guess of a meeting for example, it's actually very empowering
[00:34:20.220] 我想，以会议为例，它实际上非常能增强人的权力。
[00:34:24.980] You have a lot to gain from it
[00:34:24.980] 你会从中受益匪浅。
[00:34:26.940] So as an example, I had this like meeting for a check-in for a project that I was working on
[00:34:26.940] 举个例子，我当时开了一个会议，算是对我正在做的一个项目进行进度汇报。
[00:34:32.940] It's like a really big project. So it's taking kind of a long time and I was like, oh shoot this meeting low-key is like
[00:34:32.940] 这就像一个非常大的项目。所以耗时很长，我当时就想，哎呀，这次会议其实挺重要的。
[00:34:39.940] Too early so I moved it and I just said like hey
[00:34:39.940] 时间太早了，所以我挪了一下，然后就说了句“嘿”。
[00:34:43.660] I need just an extra day to like get this state that I think is ready to show you all
[00:34:43.660] 我还需要一天时间来调整状态，我觉得现在可以向大家展示了。
[00:34:48.560] And there's like no complaints like okay cool and then when the actual meeting came up to I think in my personal mind
[00:34:48.560] 而且也没有什么抱怨，大家都觉得“好吧，酷”，然后当真正开会的时候，我觉得在我个人看来……
[00:34:55.520] I was like, oh shoot
[00:34:55.520] 我当时就想，糟了。
[00:34:56.280] This isn't as like I guess quote-unquote perfect as I would want it to be
[00:34:56.280] 这并没有达到我理想中的“完美”程度。
[00:35:01.160] So I made the decision to basically like take control of the meeting
[00:35:01.160] 所以我决定掌控会议。
[00:35:05.920] So I would like open up the meeting by saying like oh, you know, I've been kind of busy
[00:35:05.920] 所以我想先开会说，哦，你知道，我最近有点忙。
[00:35:09.960] so some of these parts are like a little more rough around the edges, but this should be able to give us all like
[00:35:09.960] 所以其中一些部分可能还不够完善，但这应该能给我们所有人带来……
[00:35:15.720] a good idea of
[00:35:15.720] 一个好主意
[00:35:17.480] what the next step will look like and then I have like these three points for us to look through and discuss and
[00:35:17.480] 下一步会是什么样子？然后我列出了这三点供我们讨论。
[00:35:23.500] I think like before that meeting I had felt a lot of anxiety
[00:35:23.500] 我想在那次会议之前，我一直感到非常焦虑。
[00:35:28.060] Because I guess a side of me didn't think what I was showing was like as good as it could be
[00:35:28.060] 因为我猜想，我内心深处觉得我所展现出来的状态还没有达到最佳水平。
[00:35:34.920] But after like taking control in that meeting
[00:35:34.920] 但就像在那次会议上掌控局面之后一样
[00:35:38.540] Everything just went so smoothly and I was like wait, why was I nervous about this? Like everything was totally fine
[00:35:38.540] 一切都进行得太顺利了，我心想，等等，我之前为什么会紧张？明明一切都那么完美。
[00:35:44.240] But I love that I think you're totally right in that sometimes it feels so much more scary to make the decision
[00:35:44.240] 但我很高兴你说的完全正确，有时候做出这个决定确实会让人感到更加害怕。
[00:35:51.160] but once you do there's just a net positive and
[00:35:51.160] 但一旦你这么做了，就只会得到净收益，而且
[00:35:55.400] The scary part about that is that it's never like a guarantee that it'll be positive
[00:35:55.400] 可怕的是，这永远无法保证结果一定是积极的。
[00:36:00.040] but sometimes I think about how on the daily especially in a workplace setting you are subject to
[00:36:00.040] 但有时我会想，尤其是在工作场所，你每天都会受到怎样的影响……
[00:36:06.320] Everyone else's decisions that they're making on the daily and I feel like when I see an email come through that's like hey, sorry
[00:36:06.320] 其他人每天都在做决定，而当我看到一封邮件，内容是“嘿，抱歉”时，我感觉很不好意思。
[00:36:13.080] I need to push this meeting out due to schedule conflict, whatever. I'm never like really thinking that deep into it
[00:36:13.080] 因为日程冲突，我需要把这次会议推迟一下。反正我从来不会想那么多。
[00:36:18.800] I'm like, oh, yeah sure. It makes sense
[00:36:18.800] 我心想，哦，是啊，当然。这说得通。
[00:36:20.120] I can make this time but for some reason when I'm the one who has to reschedule I'm like trembling hands
[00:36:20.120] 这次我可以来，但不知为何，只要是我要改期，我的手就会发抖。
[00:36:25.240] I'm like damn. Hopefully this doesn't negatively impact someone too much, etc
[00:36:25.240] 我心想，糟了。希望这不会对任何人造成太大的负面影响，等等。
[00:36:29.440] I think it's one of those things where I'm so used to and taking other people's decisions
[00:36:29.440] 我觉得这是我太习惯于替别人做决定的原因之一。
[00:36:34.000] And then when it comes to making my own decisions
[00:36:34.000] 然后，当涉及到我自己做决定的时候……
[00:36:36.400] I have to give myself that same level of grace that I give other people
[00:36:36.400] 我必须像宽容别人一样宽容自己。
[00:36:39.840] True and usually I think there's a level of understanding like don't reschedule a meeting like 10 minutes before
[00:36:39.840] 没错，而且通常我觉得大家都会有一定的默契，比如不要在会议开始前10分钟才重新安排时间。
[00:36:46.480] Ideally, but you know basically like showing that you have control over what is happening
[00:36:46.480] 理想情况下是这样，但基本上就是要展现出你对事态发展的掌控力。
[00:36:52.600] I think puts everyone else at ease even if you're just like making it up
[00:36:52.600] 我觉得即使你只是在编故事，也能让其他人感到安心。
[00:36:56.640] So, you know, I think fake it till you make it is very true in this instance
[00:36:56.640] 所以，你知道，我觉得“假装成功直到真正成功”这句话在这个例子中非常适用。
[00:37:00.840] You're just like hey, you know this had to be moved. There's like no other option
[00:37:00.840] 你就会想，嘿，你知道这东西必须搬走。没有其他办法了。
[00:37:05.020] It's highly unlikely that people are gonna be like no unless you like
[00:37:05.020] 除非你喜欢，否则人们不太可能说“不”。
[00:37:09.360] disregarded other people's schedule and timing by like moving the meeting to some time that they couldn't make or
[00:37:09.360] 不顾他人的日程安排和时间，比如把会议改到他们无法参加的时间，或者
[00:37:16.740] Changing the meeting super last-minute that kind of stuff
[00:37:16.740] 临时更改会议安排之类的事情
[00:37:19.500] So I feel like if anything it's like a relief for other people when you make decisions
[00:37:19.500] 所以我觉得，你做出决定，对其他人来说反而是一种解脱。
[00:37:24.740] Yeah, and I feel like the workplace is a really good environment to see how your
[00:37:24.740] 是的，我觉得工作场所是一个很好的环境，可以让你看到你的表现。
[00:37:29.540] Decisions affect other people and things like that because I think at the end of the day
[00:37:29.540] 决定会影响其他人等等，因为我认为归根结底……
[00:37:33.740] That's like such a big part of why decision-making can be hard
[00:37:33.740] 这正是决策困难的重要原因之一。
[00:37:36.980] I feel like making a decision that just impacts you feels a little bit more inconsequential
[00:37:36.980] 我觉得，做出只影响自己的决定，感觉就没那么重要了。
[00:37:41.700] But when it comes to making a decision that loops in a lot of other people besides just yourself
[00:37:41.700] 但当涉及到一个牵涉到很多人（而不仅仅是你自己）的决定时，情况就不同了。
[00:37:46.540] I feel like that's when the pressure starts to feel a little bit more real
[00:37:46.540] 我觉得那时候压力才开始真正显现出来。
[00:37:50.540] Whether it's something as petty as oh, where should we eat lunch together?
[00:37:50.540] 哪怕是像“我们一起去哪里吃午饭？”这样的小事？
[00:37:55.540] Or lunch or sometimes it it truly is bigger decisions that affect other people's lives and I feel like this is also really
[00:37:55.540] 或者午餐，或者有时候，这确实是一些影响他人生活的大决定，我觉得这也真的
[00:38:03.220] evident in like smaller groups, so for example, like
[00:38:03.220] 这一点在较小的群体中很明显，例如，像
[00:38:07.180] Your immediate family or if you're in a relationship if one person is always making the decisions
[00:38:07.180] 你的直系亲属，或者如果你处于恋爱关系中，总是由一方做决定。
[00:38:13.900] There's bound to be some like friction there
[00:38:13.900] 肯定会有一些摩擦。
[00:38:16.660] I think right for sure cuz I mean decision-making is emotional labor, right? Like there's a lot of
[00:38:16.660] 我觉得肯定是对的，因为做决定本身就是一种情感劳动，对吧？就像有很多……
[00:38:23.540] Optimizing and like minimizing this and maximizing that that you have to do before you do the decision
[00:38:23.540] 优化，比如尽量减少某些因素，尽量增加某些因素，这些都是你在做决定之前必须做的。
[00:38:29.620] I mean granted not every decision is that deep and not everyone gives each decision that much thought
[00:38:29.620] 当然，并非每个决定都那么深思熟虑，也不是每个人都会对每个决定进行如此细致的思考。
[00:38:35.300] But it still is something that you have to action and choose for the group
[00:38:35.300] 但这仍然是你必须为团队采取行动和做出的选择。
[00:38:41.220] So then I can totally see I mean the easiest example is if in a friend group
[00:38:41.220] 所以，我完全明白了。我的意思是，最简单的例子就是在朋友圈里。
[00:38:45.900] It's always just one person asking to hang out
[00:38:45.900] 总是只有一个人想出去玩。
[00:38:48.780] I feel like that makes someone burnt out so quickly and
[00:38:48.780] 我觉得那样会让人很快筋疲力尽。
[00:38:52.900] Similarly in a relationship if one person is always getting tasked with making the decision
[00:38:52.900] 同样，在一段关系中，如果总是由一方来做决定
[00:38:57.460] I feel like it can definitely lead to resentment down the road
[00:38:57.460] 我觉得这肯定会在日后导致怨恨。
[00:39:01.660] yeah, definitely and I think a big lesson that I've learned as we've gotten more and more sentient as
[00:39:01.660] 是的，当然，我认为随着我们越来越有感知能力，我学到的一个重要教训是……
[00:39:09.580] As real people is that you can't always be a follower
[00:39:09.580] 作为普通人，你不可能永远做个追随者。
[00:39:14.460] You there are like moments where you definitely need to step up and I think
[00:39:14.460] 有时候，你确实需要挺身而出，我认为
[00:39:20.220] Interestingly, I feel like there is a way to be neutral
[00:39:20.220] 有趣的是，我觉得保持中立是有方法的。
[00:39:23.700] but I feel like you can't word things in a follower manner and
[00:39:23.700] 但我感觉你不能用追随者的方式表达，
[00:39:28.780] The specific thing I'm thinking about is like, you know the age-old question of oh, what should we eat tonight?
[00:39:28.780] 我具体在想的是，你知道，那个由来已久的问题，那就是，哦，我们今晚吃什么？
[00:39:35.140] I feel like what should we eat tonight is fairly neutral
[00:39:35.140] 我觉得今晚吃什么这个问题其实挺中性的。
[00:39:38.420] But you can word that same question into what do you want to eat for dinner?
[00:39:38.420] 但你也可以把同样的问题表述为：你晚餐想吃什么？
[00:39:42.180] And then I feel like it becomes very follower ask and kind of like putting that load on that other person
[00:39:42.180] 然后我觉得这就变成了粉丝式的提问，有点像把负担转嫁给了别人。
[00:39:48.420] So it's really subtle in terms of like word choice
[00:39:48.420] 所以，这在用词方面真的很微妙。
[00:39:51.620] But I feel like if you hear oh, what do you want to eat for dinner?
[00:39:51.620] 但我觉得，如果你听到有人问：“哦，你晚饭想吃什么？”
[00:39:54.380] Like over and over and over again. I feel like it does kind of drive you crazy a little bit
[00:39:54.380] 一遍又一遍，感觉真的会让人有点抓狂。
[00:39:58.380] Oh, yeah, you're like, oh, why is it always me deciding? Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck do you want to eat for dinner?
[00:39:58.380] 哦，是啊，你肯定会说，哦，为什么总是我来决定？是啊，我就会说，你他妈的晚饭想吃什么？
[00:40:03.980] You're like, why are we always eating what I want to eat? What about you? Do you have any opinions?
[00:40:03.980] 你可能会想，为什么我们总是吃我想吃的东西？你呢？你有什么看法吗？
[00:40:09.020] It's so funny too because I feel like surface level it's like harmless
[00:40:09.020] 这真的太搞笑了，因为我觉得表面上看它好像没什么大不了的。
[00:40:14.380] Yeah, and I mean it is really harmless and you can even frame it as oh this person is so considerate
[00:40:14.380] 是的，我的意思是这真的无伤大雅，你甚至可以把它描述成“这个人真体贴”。
[00:40:19.860] Like they always want to know what I want to eat
[00:40:19.860] 他们总是想知道我想吃什么
[00:40:21.700] But you know in the active adult world, I feel like it does become a burden that you have to carry
[00:40:21.700] 但你知道，在活跃的成年人世界里，我觉得这确实会成为你必须承担的一种负担。
[00:40:27.820] Yeah for sure and it's kind of like you said right? It's a totally harmless phrase
[00:40:27.820] 没错，就像你说的，这完全是一句无害的话。
[00:40:32.380] But if you were to hear it repeatedly you start to notice it. You're like, hmm
[00:40:32.380] 但如果你反复听到这句话，你就会开始注意到它。你会想，嗯……
[00:40:38.340] That is yet another decision you have to make how to word
[00:40:38.340] 这是你必须决定的另一个措辞问题。
[00:40:42.260] your question to the other person I
[00:40:42.260] 你向另一个人提出的问题
[00:40:47.020] Guess we are just doomed to continuously make decisions for the rest of our lives
[00:40:47.020] 看来我们注定要在余生中不断地做决定。
[00:40:56.580] But I do think it's always helpful to have other people
[00:40:56.580] 但我确实认为有其他人在身边总是有帮助的。
[00:41:00.140] Weigh in a little bit in any way that they can to lighten the load of these decisions
[00:41:00.140] 他们尽其所能地参与其中，以减轻这些决定带来的负担。
[00:41:05.820] So I feel like it was pretty interesting to talk about like the different
[00:41:05.820] 所以我觉得讨论这些不同之处挺有意思的。
[00:41:09.660] Areas in life that have a lot of heavy decision-making that we experienced
[00:41:09.660] 生活中有很多需要做出重大决定的领域，我们都经历过。
