[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal. Wow, happy new year. It's been a while. I feel almost a little out of practice.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。哇，新年快乐！好久不见了，感觉有点生疏了。
[00:00:23.960] I think for anyone who has listened to this podcast over the last five years or so that we've been doing it knows that we always take a little holiday break, but we did allow ourselves a bit of a longer break this year.
[00:00:23.960] 我想，过去五年左右一直收听我们播客的听众都知道，我们总会抽出一点时间休息一下，但今年我们给自己放了一个更长的假。
[00:00:36.140] And I'm not gonna lie, I feel a little rusty coming back to podcast. But the rest was definitely much needed. At least on my end, I had a lot of travel right before December. Actually, even in December, I had a decent amount of travel too. So I was so tired. The last two weeks of December, I literally just rotted at home, stayed in bed. I think I barely talked to anyone too for two weeks.
[00:00:36.140] 说实话，重新开始做播客感觉有点生疏。不过，这段休息时间确实很有必要。至少对我来说，12月之前我出差了很多地方。实际上，12月我也出差了不少地方。所以我当时非常疲惫。12月的最后两周，我基本上就待在家里，躺在床上。我想我那两周几乎没跟任何人说过话。
[00:01:01.200] Right. Literally the moment that you stopped traveling, I started traveling. So I was also out of state for a couple weeks. So all in all, it was just a great long break for us. Honestly, reflecting back on it, I'm like, is this just what adulthood is? Like we just get more and more busy and it's not even necessarily we plan to become busier, but just more responsibilities happen and the people around you affect you too.
[00:01:01.200] 没错。你刚停止旅行，我就开始旅行了。所以我也去了外州待了几个星期。总而言之，这对我们来说是一次很棒的长假。说实话，现在回想起来，我就在想，这就是成年人的生活吗？我们变得越来越忙，甚至不一定是我们计划要变得更忙，而是责任越来越多，周围的人也会影响我们。
[00:01:27.180] So for example, you know, having people get married means weddings that you're probably going to be attending or milestones that we're hitting, our friends are probably hitting too. So that means not only will we try to celebrate our own milestones, but we'll also be trying to celebrate our loved ones milestones as well.
[00:01:27.180] 例如，你知道，有人结婚意味着你可能会参加婚礼，或者我们自己、我们的朋友可能也会迎来人生中的重要里程碑。所以这意味着我们不仅会庆祝自己的里程碑，也会庆祝我们所爱之人的里程碑。
[00:01:44.580] Yeah, exactly. And it's so funny because I feel like sitting down and looking at our calendars together. It's just crazy. It's like a lot of travel, a lot of obligations here and there. And in general, it's actually a very positive thing because it just means that there's more to celebrate in life, more milestones being hit, etc. But it does mean that, you know, time is a resource and it's a fairly limited resource in a sense.
[00:01:44.580] 对，没错。这真的很有趣，因为我感觉应该坐下来一起看看我们的日程表。简直太疯狂了。到处都是旅行，到处都是各种各样的事务。总的来说，这其实是件好事，因为这意味着生活中会有更多值得庆祝的事情，更多值得达成的里程碑等等。但这也意味着，你知道，时间是一种资源，而且从某种意义上说，它是一种相当有限的资源。
[00:02:12.940] It really is. And actually, that kind of aligns with my personal New Year goal slash thoughts. I'm trying to be a more like responsible person. I guess it's more like trying to be more intentional with how I utilize my time. Hopefully creating more structure in my life would increase my overall efficiency.
[00:02:12.940] 确实如此。实际上，这跟我新年目标/想法也挺契合的。我努力让自己变得更有责任感。我想，更准确地说，是努力更有意识地利用时间。希望通过让生活更有条理，能提高我的整体效率。
[00:02:36.660] I'm definitely applying this a lot to like my work life where I'm trying to be in a simple, all encompassing term. I'm trying to just be a better version of myself as an employee. I like that. I think mine is somewhat similar, somewhat not, but definitely a lot of internal reflection because my New Year's resolution is to just work on myself.
[00:02:36.660] 我确实把这种理念运用到我的工作生活中，我努力让自己成为一个更优秀的员工。我喜欢这种感觉。我觉得我的情况和你的有些相似，有些不同，但肯定也进行了很多自我反思，因为我的新年目标就是提升自己。
[00:02:59.180] And a big part of that is working on my confidence, trying to be a diva in my daily life, maybe only the positive parts of being a diva. And I think that means stuff like working out more consistently, being more healthy, being more conscious about the things that I eat and consume. And also even just somewhat simple things like posting more on Instagram. I think I'm ready to be perceived again.
[00:02:59.180] 这其中很重要的一部分在于提升我的自信，努力在日常生活中展现出明星风范，或许只展现明星风范中积极的一面。我认为这包括更规律地锻炼，更注重健康，更关注我的饮食。甚至包括一些看似简单的事情，比如多在Instagram上发帖。我想我已经准备好再次被人关注了。
[00:03:24.780] Oh my god, Instagram is such a funny one because I remember we talked about this in a previous episode where we were like, we try to be supportive of our friends on Instagram by like commenting and stuff. But we're also similar because I think when we looked back on 2024, we both did not post. Like not a single post. Right. Dude, I fit in my one annual post. Oh my god, you did? Like second week of December. I was like, I have to post something. Oh wait, I do remember now. Yeah, you did.
[00:03:24.780] 我的天啊，Instagram 真的太搞笑了，因为我记得我们之前在一期节目里聊过，我们当时说，我们会在 Instagram 上支持朋友，比如评论什么的。但我们俩也很像，因为我觉得当我们回顾 2024 年的时候，我们俩都没发过帖子。真的，一个都没发。对啊。哥们儿，我一年就发一个帖子。我的天啊，你发了？大概是 12 月的第二周。我当时就想，我得发点什么。哦等等，我想起来了。对，你发了。
[00:03:54.580] I did not manage to post anything, sadly. But I agree with that. It really is nice to have some memories to look back on. You know, as we get older and our memory fails us more often, it's nice to just look back. Even if they're like shitty photos, having them is already pretty good. I know you and I talked about a couple of our friends who do like massive photo dumps of their travels or just hang out with friends and whatnot. And we're always like, oh, that's so cute. Yeah.
[00:03:54.580] 可惜我没能发任何东西。不过我同意你的看法。能有一些回忆可以回顾真的很好。你知道，随着年龄增长，我们的记忆力会越来越差，所以回顾过去真的很有意义。即使照片拍得不好，有它们也已经很好了。我知道你和我之前聊过几个朋友，他们喜欢把旅行或者和朋友聚会的照片都上传到网上。我们总是会说，哦，真可爱。是啊。
[00:04:24.240] Yet we never do it. But this year I was kind of like, maybe I should do it. Even if it's like quarterly or something, right? Yeah. And maybe we can do it like our friend where they just have a separate Instagram for like photo dumps. Right. Yeah. And then it feels less pressured. Yeah. Yeah. Are Finstas still a thing? It is crazy, though, because I wonder if it's such a late 20s thing to come back to posting on social media.
[00:04:24.240] 但我们从来没这么做过。不过今年我突然想，或许我应该试试。哪怕是每季度发一次也行，对吧？嗯。或许我们可以像我朋友那样，专门开个Instagram账号用来发照片。对。嗯。这样感觉压力就小多了。嗯。嗯。现在还流行“小号”（Finsta）吗？不过这确实挺疯狂的，因为我在想，是不是只有快30岁的人才会重新开始在社交媒体上发帖。
[00:04:49.980] For a while, it really wasn't just us that sort of stopped posting on social media. I think a lot of our friends became a little bit less active in terms of posting like grid posts and whatnot. And we're just dabbling stories from time to time. But now I'm like, OK, I only have what, like a year and a half left of my 20s. Like I have to fucking document it and post it up somewhere. True. Just to prove that I existed once in my 20s. But actually, speaking of social media, the TikTok ban. Oh, my God.
[00:04:49.980] 有一段时间，不只是我们停止在社交媒体上发帖。我觉得很多朋友都减少了发帖，比如发照片合集之类的。我们只是偶尔发点动态。但现在我就想，好吧，我的二十几岁只剩一年半了。我得赶紧记录下来，发到某个地方。真的。就为了证明我二十几岁的时候也存在过。不过说起来，说到社交媒体，TikTok被禁了。我的天哪。
[00:05:19.120] Can we just talk about that for a second? Dude, it was crazy. I mean, I guess it's like technically actually still ongoing because TikTok is gone from all of the U.S. app stores. But if you have TikTok downloaded, then you can still use it. But for like that, what was it, like 24 hours or something? It was blocked and people were like freaking out. Yeah, it was just such an interesting moment in time. Yeah.
[00:05:19.120] 我们能聊聊这件事吗？老兄，那场面太疯狂了。我的意思是，严格来说，这件事其实还在持续，因为TikTok已经从美国所有应用商店下架了。但如果你之前下载了TikTok，那你仍然可以继续使用。但就那么一会儿，大概24小时吧？它被封禁了，大家都吓坏了。是啊，那真是个很有意思的时刻。没错。
[00:05:45.780] So we were actually together when the TikTok ban happened. A lot of the people in our friend group who are also on that trip are also avid TikTok users. So there was just like a collective level of despair that we were feeling once we opened TikTok and saw the black screen. Especially because, I don't know, like as much as TikTok is a place that I go to for like funny content and like memes and jokes and whatnot.
[00:05:45.780] 所以TikTok被禁的时候，我们正好在一起。我们朋友圈里很多跟我们一起旅行的人都是TikTok的忠实用户。所以当我们打开TikTok看到黑屏的时候，我们都感到一种集体性的绝望。尤其是因为，我不知道，TikTok对我来说就像是一个可以看搞笑内容、表情包、段子之类的平台。
[00:06:09.940] Like it's also very much a resource for me for like travel tips or restaurant reviews and all those other things that I used to go to different apps for. So once it was banned, I was like, shit, I guess on my next few vacations, I'm just going to go to these countries and do nothing. Like I don't know what I would do there. Okay, that's a bit dramatic. Is it though? Is it? It's a lot of bookmarks that we're almost gone. But you are really right. It is a great resource for a lot of different content.
[00:06:09.940] 它对我来说也是个非常重要的资源，比如旅行攻略、餐厅点评等等，以前我得去不同的app上找这些东西。所以它被禁之后，我就想，完了，看来接下来的几次假期，我只能去这些国家什么都不做了。我都不知道到了那里能干什么。好吧，我这么说有点夸张了。是吗？是吗？我们收藏了很多东西，现在都快用完了。但你说得对，它确实是个内容丰富的宝库。
[00:06:39.520] Honestly, I do see a lot of travel TikToks too and I take notes on them occasionally. But the day, I think it was like the weekend before the ban was going to be in place. I spent a couple hours just writing down a bunch of recipes that I had bookmarked. And I was like, dang, I guess if TikTok really goes away, like where am I going to find quick and easy recipes? Dude, that's like full circle. Taking the most brain rot app and then turning it into like analog notes in your journal or something.
[00:06:39.520] 说实话，我也经常看旅行相关的TikTok视频，偶尔也会做些笔记。但那天，大概是禁令生效前那个周末，我花了几个小时把我收藏的一堆食谱都记了下来。然后我就想，哎，如果TikTok真的没了，那我以后去哪儿找那些简单快捷的食谱呢？这简直就是个轮回。用最让人头疼的app，最后却把笔记整理成纸质的，写在日记本上什么的。
[00:07:08.180] We're back to the pen and paper route. Wait, you're so right. Oh my god. I literally wrote the recipes down in like Google Docs and stuff. But if there was one good thing that came out of that 24-hour TikTok ban, it was all the jokes and all of the cultural exchange that happened from all the Americans migrating to Xiao Hongshu slash Red Note. Like that was so funny. It really was.
[00:07:08.180] 我们又得用回纸笔了。等等，你说得太对了。我的天哪。我之前真的把食谱都写在谷歌文档之类的软件里了。不过，如果说TikTok那24小时的禁令有什么好处的话，那就是美国人涌入小红书/Red Note，引发了各种笑话和文化交流。真的太搞笑了。真的。
[00:07:35.960] I actually did download Xiao Hongshu for a second. But then it asked me to like log in via WeChat or whatever. And I was like, oh, I'm too lazy to do this. So I was like, whatever. But one of my friends who does use it, she literally sent me like some screenshots of people thirsting over Chinese content creators. Dude, it was so funny. I think there was two. There was one of like Americans thirsting over Chinese content creators.
[00:07:35.960] 我其实下载过小红书一小会儿。但是它让我用微信之类的账号登录。我就想，哎，我懒得弄。所以就没下载。但我有个朋友用小红书，她给我发了一些截图，是一些网友对中国博主犯花痴的样子。天哪，太搞笑了。好像有两张。一张是美国人对中国博主犯花痴的样子。
[00:08:03.680] And then there was also like Chinese people thirsting over these like new random American content creators. Oh my god. That's awesome. It's just such a unique situation because the Chinese audience would maybe comment in like Chinese. And so, you know, the typical US person might not be able to understand that. So they're like, oh, what's happening in my comments? But it's just like all thirst comments. Honestly, that's hilarious.
[00:08:03.680] 然后，还有一些中国人对这些新出现的美国内容创作者垂涎三尺。我的天哪。这太棒了。这种情况真的很独特，因为中国观众可能会用中文评论。所以，你知道，典型的美国人可能看不懂。他们会想，哦，我的评论里发生了什么？但其实全是些“求关注”的评论。说真的，这太搞笑了。
[00:08:28.180] And I thought it was pretty heartwarming because you see a lot of cultural exchange from people from different countries on like Reddit or like TikTok and other forums and stuff. But this just felt so much more direct. And in a lot of ways, I think the US-China political relations have been a little bit complicated. So seeing our general population and the general population of China kind of interact was just so cute. Like I loved it. It was.
[00:08:28.180] 我觉得这很暖心，因为在Reddit、TikTok和其他论坛上，我们经常看到不同国家的人们进行文化交流。但这次感觉更加直接。而且在很多方面，我认为美中政治关系一直有点复杂。所以看到我们两国的普通民众互动交流，真的太可爱了。我非常喜欢。真的。
[00:08:57.840] There were some like pretty wholesome jokes and stuff. I also saw some people start to post on TikTok like, hey, welcome to the Red Note users. Just some rules of thumb. Make sure if you post, throw in a translation. Even a Google Translate is good enough. Just don't leave it English only or anything. There's so many users who might not speak English at all. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just an interesting, funny, yet heartwarming, as you said, situation.
[00:08:57.840] 有些笑话挺温馨的。我还看到有人在TikTok上发帖，比如“嘿，欢迎加入Red Note用户行列。一些基本规则：发帖的时候一定要加上翻译。谷歌翻译也行。千万别只用英语。有很多用户可能根本不会说英语。” 我也不知道该怎么形容。就像你说的，这真是一个有趣、好笑又暖心的局面。
[00:09:27.480] But I wonder now, have people all flocked back to TikTok just immediately? That lasted like the short 24 hours and now we're just back. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I think like when someone downloads an app, to get them to delete the app might be like another big step. So maybe people still have it on their phone or whatnot. But I am very much so looking forward to more cultural exchange, like more memes and jokes between Xiaohongshu users and TikTok users.
[00:09:27.480] 但我现在好奇，大家是不是都立刻又涌回TikTok了？那股热潮也就持续了短短24小时，现在又回来了。是啊。我也不知道。我觉得就像有人下载了一个应用，要让他们卸载它可能是另一大挑战。所以也许大家手机里还留着TikTok之类的。但我非常期待看到更多文化交流，比如小红书用户和TikTok用户之间更多的梗图和段子。
[00:09:55.320] Even if TikTok continues to be back. Also, one of the funniest moments, I think, was when some random Red Note user made this video like welcoming Americans to Red Note. And then people were like, oh my God, the CEO like welcomed us. It's like some random dude. Yeah. It was not the CEO at all.
[00:09:55.320] 就算TikTok继续回归也一样。还有，我觉得最搞笑的时刻之一，是某个Red Note的普通用户拍了个视频，欢迎美国人来Red Note。然后大家就都惊呆了，说：“我的天，是CEO欢迎我们来的。” 就一个路人甲而已。没错，那根本不是CEO。
[00:10:22.940] That saga was so funny because I think like that guy, his girlfriend actually is a creator on Red Note, right? And then some people were like, dude, why is this video of your boyfriend viral? Doesn't that dude look like your boyfriend? And she was like, wait, that literally is my boyfriend. Why does like all of the US think that he's the Red Note CEO?
[00:10:22.940] 那件事真的太搞笑了，因为我觉得那个男的，他女朋友其实是Red Note的创作者，对吧？然后有些人就说，哥们儿，你男朋友的视频怎么火了？视频里的人长得是不是跟你男朋友很像？她就说，等等，那不就是我男朋友吗？为什么全美国的人都觉得他是Red Note的CEO？
[00:10:44.500] I also saw one that was like, as soon as the Americans started trickling into Red Note, some users would post like their English homework and be like, solve this American. Wait, that's so funny. They're like, challenge. I bet you can't solve these questions. Wait, that would get me. That would definitely get me. I was also very shocked because Red Note or Xiao Hong Shu is literally all Chinese.
[00:10:44.500] 我还看到一个帖子，好像美国人刚开始零星地涌入Red Note的时候，一些用户就发帖说他们的英语作业，然后说：“解开这个美国人的题。”等等，这也太搞笑了。他们好像在说：“挑战！我打赌你解不开这些题。”等等，这要是真让我上钩，我肯定上钩。我当时也很震惊，因为Red Note或者小红书上明明全是中国人。
[00:11:14.160] There are no English prompts, I think, at least from what I'm aware of. So I was like, how did these people sign up? How did they get into the app? Did like, did everyone just suddenly learn Mandarin overnight? Oh, that's true. But I will say like, once you get in and like have an account and stuff, that app is so awesome. Like just being able to use all the features on it.
[00:11:14.160] 我觉得好像没有英文提示，至少我没看到。所以我就想，这些人是怎么注册的？怎么才能用上这个app？难道大家都一夜之间学会了普通话吗？哦，还真是这样。不过我得说，一旦你注册成功，有了账号什么的，这个app真的太棒了。能用上它的所有功能，简直爽爆了。
[00:11:39.280] Like I felt like I was looking at TikTok, Tumblr and like Pinterest or something at the same time. And I was like, dude, we need this. I don't need TikTok Live or like TikTok Shop. I just want it to be like Tumblr slash Pinterest. That's true. Xiao Hong Shu is very like unique in its layout. The Reels slash short form videos. But there's also that Pinterest slash almost blogging layout. I wonder though, if that means that Xiao Hong Shu is going to try to make like a US server.
[00:11:39.280] 感觉就像同时在看TikTok、Tumblr和Pinterest之类的网站。我就想，老兄，我们需要这个。我不需要TikTok Live或者TikTok Shop之类的功能。我只是想要一个像Tumblr和Pinterest结合体的东西。没错。小红书的布局非常独特，Reels是短视频，但同时又有点像Pinterest和博客的结合体。不过我很好奇，这是否意味着小红书打算建立一个美国服务器。
[00:12:09.320] That would be pretty cool, honestly. But yeah, the other thing that kind of surprised me was I noticed a lot of overlap between the audios that TikTokers use in the US. And then audios that were being used on videos on Red Note as well. So maybe it's kind of like, I don't know, the media we consume is like closer than we think. Yeah, maybe you're right. Because I think sometimes Chinese memes that I see are actually just completely different.
[00:12:09.320] 说真的，那挺酷的。不过，还有一点让我有点惊讶，我注意到美国TikTok用户用的音频和Red Note视频里用的音频有很多重合之处。所以，也许我们接触的媒体比我们想象的更接近。嗯，也许你说得对。因为我觉得有时候我看到的中国梗图其实完全不一样。
[00:12:35.640] But yeah, I guess there is a section where there's actually huge overlap. What's funny is just funny. It's universal. That is true. I also really like that Red Note has like a trending section. Oh. I think to an extent that's supposed to be like built into the TikTok algorithm because your For You page is a combination of what you want to see and what's like popular. But to have like a specific discover page of popular posts, like that's pretty cool. That is pretty cool. I'm going to be honest though.
[00:12:35.640] 不过，我觉得确实有一部分内容和TikTok有很多重叠之处。好笑的东西就是好笑，它是普适的。没错。我也很喜欢Red Note的“热门”版块。哦，我觉得这在某种程度上应该是TikTok算法的一部分，因为你的“为你推荐”页面会同时显示你想看的内容和热门内容。但是能有一个专门的“发现”页面，展示热门帖子，这真的很棒。真的很棒。说实话……
[00:13:03.960] I actually deleted Red Note after I decided to not log in with my WeChat info. That's all it took. Just like one prompt. You're like, I'm done. No, actually. My friend's back in the day gave me the suggestion that Red Note is really good for if you're looking for authentic Chinese food. Just check Red Note to see what people post about certain restaurants.
[00:13:03.960] 我决定不再用微信登录后，就把Red Note删了。就这么简单，就一个提示。你会觉得，完了，不用了。不，其实，我以前的朋友推荐我说，Red Note很适合想吃正宗中餐的人。你可以去Red Note看看大家对某些餐厅的评价。
[00:13:32.030] Because most of these users grew up with authentic Chinese food. They're probably, you know, from Asia. My friend's suggestion is basically to weigh these opinions a little more than your typical, you know, like Yelp or Google reviews. Low-key genius. Like go straight to the true foodies. Yeah. I'll have to give it a shot.
[00:13:32.030] 因为这些用户大多从小吃正宗的中国菜长大。他们很可能来自亚洲。我朋友的建议是，与其参考Yelp或谷歌之类的评论，不如更重视这些意见。这真是个好主意。直接找真正的美食家。嗯，我得试试。
[00:13:53.890] But actually this year, one of my New Year's resolutions, like I said, was to kind of be more conscious about what I'm putting into my body and just taking care of my well-being in general. So one of our resolutions this year is to order way less takeout. So that includes delivery apps and stuff. I was a power user for a while, but trying to really cut that out.
[00:13:53.890] 但实际上，就像我之前说的，我今年的新年愿望之一就是更加注意自己吃的东西，好好照顾自己的健康。所以我们今年的愿望之一就是大幅减少外卖。这包括外卖软件之类的。我之前有一段时间是外卖重度用户，但现在正努力戒掉。
[00:14:17.630] And also just cooking at home a lot more, which I think we already kind of did, but really just increasing that and being more health conscious and whatnot. So maybe those restaurant recommendations will have to wait a little bit. Mm-hmm. Ooh, I like that. Okay. I have a question though. When you cook at home, are you making like big feasts basically? I don't know. Maybe like one entree, one side kind of a thing or like two sides. Yeah, I'm just thinking because I have a similar goal as you.
[00:14:17.630] 而且我也打算多在家做饭，我觉得我们之前也差不多这么做了，但这次是想增加在家做饭的频率，也更注重健康之类的。所以，那些餐厅推荐可能要暂时搁置一下了。嗯哼。哦，我喜欢这个主意。好的。不过我有个问题。你在家做饭的时候，是不是会做那种丰盛的大餐？我不知道。可能就是一道主菜配一道配菜，或者两道配菜之类的。嗯，我只是在想这个问题，因为我和你的目标差不多。
[00:14:46.710] Basically try to cook at home as much as I can. But it's just to me, I guess the problem might be opposite to you because since I live alone and it's just me, I can eat shitty meals, if that makes sense. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But if it was like two people, if my boyfriend's over, then it feels more like, oh, we need to have like a proper meal. You know, like we actually have to make a meal of substance versus, you know, I could just have girl dinner basically.
[00:14:46.710] 基本上我尽量在家做饭。不过我觉得，可能跟你的情况正好相反，因为我一个人住，只有我一个人，所以随便吃点东西也无所谓，不知道你能不能理解。哦，对对对。但如果是两个人，比如我男朋友来，那就感觉得好好吃顿饭了。你知道，就是那种得认真做顿饭的感觉，而不是像平时那样，随便吃点东西就完事儿了。
[00:15:13.850] And so I can definitely see how it gets very tiring, you know, making a full proper meal every single day. You're like, oh, fuck it. Let's just order takeout today. No, I totally feel that because any meal that I have where like maybe James is out for dinner with his friends and family or whatever, it's automatically ramen. It's like ramen and like a side of dumpling or something. And that was like my entire diet for solo meals for the last like three years. And this year I was like, maybe I also deserve to eat some like cabbage.
[00:15:13.850] 所以，我完全能理解每天都要做一顿像样的饭有多累。你会想，算了，今天就叫外卖吧。没错，我完全能体会这种感觉，因为每次我一个人吃饭，比如詹姆斯和他的朋友家人出去吃饭什么的，那肯定都是拉面。拉面配个饺子什么的。过去三年，我一个人吃饭的时候几乎都是这样。今年我就想，也许我也该吃点卷心菜之类的了。
[00:15:43.210] Things that actually grow out of this ground and are not deep fried. So totally feel that. I think what's been helping me is I'll try to make four portions of something so that maybe one of the extra portions we can like save it for a weeknight meal. James can take it to lunch or something. And that way I don't feel like I'm constantly making food for like a family of two, like every single meal, you know.
[00:15:43.210] 那些真正从这片土地上长出来，而不是油炸的食物。我完全理解这种感受。我觉得对我有帮助的是，我会尽量一次做四份，这样多出来的一份就可以留到工作日晚上吃。詹姆斯可以带去当午餐什么的。这样我就不会感觉自己好像每顿饭都要给两个人做饭似的。
[00:16:11.250] It's crazy how just adding one more person into the household increases the food count. Yeah, yeah. I know. Because it's not like doubling the food. It's almost like 2.5 or like three times because you're like, oh, well, maybe we should have like an appetizer. Yeah. You're like, it's not just me. We can actually have more than one plate of food. Dude, I love it though. Like I feel like it makes it way more fun and like joyful. Mm-hmm.
[00:16:11.250] 真是不可思议，家里多一个人，食物量就增加了。是啊，是啊，我知道。因为这可不是食物翻倍，而是差不多翻了2.5倍甚至3倍，因为你会想，哦，或许我们应该再来点开胃菜。对，你会想，不只是我一个人这么想，我们真的可以吃好几盘菜了。老兄，不过我喜欢这样。我觉得这样更有乐趣，也更快乐。嗯哼。
[00:16:37.210] I think there's also the worry of if we just eat what I eat, will my boyfriend be like full? Like will they be satisfied? Yeah. He's always like, where's the protein in this meal? I'm like, uh, just eat it. I have no protein in this house. Man, I feel like protein is like the first thing I start to crave. But I've been trying to incorporate more veggies and stuff.
[00:16:37.210] 我觉得还有个顾虑，就是如果我们只吃我吃的东西，我男朋友会不会吃饱？会不会觉得满足？是啊。他总是问，这顿饭里哪有蛋白质？我就说，呃，吃就对了。我家根本没蛋白质。唉，感觉我最先想吃的就是蛋白质。不过我一直在努力多吃蔬菜之类的。
[00:17:04.130] And I guess anyone who's close to me knows I like love fried food. So I feel like I'm always like deep frying my veggies or something. But this year I was like, you know, I should dabble in some like steaming. You know, like make that shit more healthy. Yeah. Or just like toss it into a soup maybe. I don't know. I'm not a big soup person, but I'm getting there. I'm working on it. I have a full year ahead of me. I do sometimes just do salad, which I feel like is relatively simple and quick.
[00:17:04.130] 我想熟悉我的人都知道我超爱吃油炸食品。所以感觉我总是把蔬菜炸来炸去。但今年我想，我应该尝试一下清蒸之类的做法。你知道，这样更健康一些。嗯。或者干脆加到汤里也行。我不知道。我不太爱喝汤，但我正在努力。我还有一整年的时间呢。有时候我也会做沙拉，我觉得沙拉比较简单快捷。
[00:17:33.010] But if my boyfriend's over, I'm always like, was this enough for you? Just a bunch of leaves, you know? My only beef with salad is like, why is it cold? Oh. I see. Like I have to have it with something warm. I can't just do like a full like cold salad. That's fair. So maybe like a quinoa salad or something. But then you have to cook the quinoa. And then I'm like, I might as well just have a rice bowl or something. Okay. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah. I'm like a grain hater.
[00:17:33.010] 但如果我男朋友来我家，我总是会问，这点儿够吗？就几片叶子而已，你知道吗？我对沙拉唯一不满的地方就是，为什么是冷的？哦，我明白了。我得配点热乎的东西才行。我不能就这么吃一整盘冷沙拉。这倒也说得通。所以也许可以做藜麦沙拉之类的。但那样的话藜麦还得煮。然后我就想，那我干脆吃碗米饭算了。好吧，这倒也说得通。这倒也说得通。是啊，我其实挺讨厌谷物的。
[00:18:02.630] Mmm. True. You know me. Always got like kids and shit on my mind. So I've been watching like this one account where this mom makes her two boys food. And it's lunch meals that they take to school. Based on what is left in the lunchbox when they get back, she knows if it was a success or not. And that just like revolutionized my cooking game. I'm like, oh my god, is James going to finish his bowl? You know? I just can't wait to add another family member so that I could see if they finish their bowl.
[00:18:02.630] 嗯，没错。你知道我的，我总是满脑子都是孩子和各种琐事。最近我在关注一个账号，一个妈妈给她两个儿子做饭，都是带去学校的午餐。她会根据孩子们放学回家后午餐盒里剩下的东西来判断做得好不好。这简直彻底改变了我的烹饪方式。我当时就想，天哪，詹姆斯能吃完他的那碗吗？你知道吗？我迫不及待地想让家里再添一个成员，看看他们能不能把碗吃完。
[00:18:32.130] Oh my god. Dude. I would not be able to handle that criticism. Like damn, you didn't eat all the food I gave you. What the fuck? It makes me think back because actually my mom packed my lunch for a very long time. Yeah. Almost through like probably through like junior year actually of high school. And I wouldn't always eat everything. Like sometimes you end up going out for lunch with your friends or whatever. At the time it didn't seem like a very big deal. And now it just like breaks my heart thinking about those days. Dude. Okay. I'm going to be honest.
[00:18:32.130] 我的天啊。兄弟。我肯定受不了这种批评。比如，你居然没吃完我给你的饭。搞什么鬼？这让我想起以前，我妈给我准备了很久的午餐。对，差不多一直到高中三年级。而且我也不总是吃完。有时候会和朋友出去吃午饭什么的。当时我觉得这没什么大不了的。但现在想想，真是心疼。兄弟。好吧。我实话实说。
[00:19:01.730] Similar, right? Like sometimes I don't eat everything that's given to me. So what I would do is I would quietly take it back to my room. Try to eat it before giving the like Tupperware back. Or maybe I would try to like make my friends eat some. Yeah. So that I don't bring back like a filled Tupperware. Uh-huh. I guess it was maybe part of the whole thing about, oh, you want to try to finish everything on your plate kind of mentality. There were some bad days. The worst days, dude, this is so bad actually.
[00:19:01.730] 差不多吧？有时候别人给我的东西我吃不完。所以我会悄悄地把剩下的带回房间，尽量吃完再把饭盒还回去。或者我会想办法让朋友们吃一些。对，这样我就不会带回满满一盒饭了。嗯哼。我觉得这可能跟那种“要尽量把盘子里的东西都吃完”的心态有关。有时候也会有很糟糕的日子。最糟糕的时候，老兄，真的太糟糕了。
[00:19:29.970] The worst days I would just have to toss some of it and then be like, yeah, this is the finished Tupperware. No, that was me too. That's why it's like I feel so guilty thinking back. I'm just like my mom spent like 30 minutes on that lunch. You know what I mean? Like at least. Yeah. Single tier. I think by high school though, I managed to just convince my mom to like give me a couple bucks for like a slice of pizza at school. It was easier on all of us. Yeah. It's brutal, man.
[00:19:29.970] 最糟糕的时候，我只能扔掉一些，然后心想，嗯，这就是剩下的特百惠饭盒了。不，我以前也是这样。所以现在回想起来，我感觉很愧疚。我妈至少花了30分钟准备午餐，你懂我的意思吗？至少也得花点时间吧。是啊，单层饭盒。不过到了高中，我终于说服我妈给我几块钱，让我在学校买片披萨。这对我们所有人来说都轻松多了。是啊，真是太残酷了。
[00:19:57.950] I mean, I assume when I have a kid, they'll also go through that phase too. So yeah. I'm just trying to prepare my heart. Yeah. It's inevitable. Yeah. I think I didn't start to like vegetables until probably college, maybe even later. That's true. Like vegetables to me was more like it was like decoration. Oh my God, dude. That's so funny because when my brother and I were super young, you know, probably elementary kids or younger for dinner, sometimes my mom would make broccoli and then we'd have
[00:19:57.950] 我的意思是，我猜等我有了孩子，他们也会经历这个阶段。所以，嗯。我只是想提前做好心理准备。是啊，这是不可避免的。嗯。我觉得我大概直到大学，甚至可能更晚才开始喜欢吃蔬菜。确实如此。对我来说，蔬菜更像是装饰品。我的天哪，兄弟。这太搞笑了，因为我和我弟弟小时候，大概是小学生或者更小的时候，有时候我妈会做西兰花，然后我们就会……
[00:20:26.490] our little bowl of rice and we'd be like, oh, gross vegetables. So we would take the broccoli and we would stick it into our rice and basically make a forest. And we were just like, we're literally playing with our food and like procrastinating on eating it. Like, oh, look at this forest I made. I'm dead. That's so funny. You know, now that you say that, actually, I feel like growing up eating a lot of Korean cuisine, I wasn't necessarily a vegetable hater just because the way Korean people cook their
[00:20:26.490] 我们面前放着一小碗米饭，然后我们会想，哎呀，蔬菜真难吃。所以我们会把西兰花拿出来，插到米饭里，基本上就搭了个“西兰花森林”。我们就像在玩食物一样，一边玩一边拖延着不吃。就像，“哎呀，看看我搭的这片森林！笑死我了！” 太搞笑了。你知道吗，你这么一说，其实我觉得，从小吃很多韩国菜，我并不是真的讨厌蔬菜，只是因为韩国人做蔬菜的方式……
[00:20:53.750] vegetables and like roots and stuff has like sauce or a lot of seasoning on it. So it was always like a part of my routine. But I remember once in high school, I went on a quote unquote diet. And then I was like, I'm just going to eat broccoli like every day for lunch. So my mom would pack me like a huge thing of like steamed broccoli. But broccoli smells kind of weird, right? So then I remember my friends were like, oh, my God, your backpack smells like broccoli farts. And then they called me broccoli farts the whole day.
[00:20:53.750] 蔬菜，还有根茎类蔬菜之类的，通常都会淋上酱汁或者放很多调料。所以吃这些一直都是我日常生活的一部分。但我记得高中时有一次，我“节食”了一段时间。然后我就想，我每天午饭就只吃西兰花。所以我妈就给我准备了一大盒蒸西兰花。但是西兰花闻起来有点怪，对吧？然后我记得我的朋友们就说，我的天哪，你的书包闻起来像西兰花放屁。然后他们一整天都叫我“西兰花屁”。
[00:21:22.530] And then after that, I was like, I'm never bringing broccoli to school. Oh, my God. Wait, that's kind of brutal. It was brutal. But I get it because one of the craziest things that always is a mystery to me is dumplings also smell like fart. If you do. Right. Like if you put them in a Tupperware and like pack them up. And I'm like, what even is making them smell like fart?
[00:21:22.530] 然后我就想，我以后再也不带西兰花去学校了。我的天哪。等等，这有点太狠了吧。确实有点狠。但我能理解，因为对我来说，最不可思议的事情之一就是饺子闻起来像屁。如果你真的闻到了。对吧。就像你把它们放在保鲜盒里打包好。我就想，到底是什么让它们闻起来像屁？
[00:21:49.590] But I'm like, I can never like I love dumplings, but I would never allow my mom to make me pack dumplings to bring to school. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make because it just the smell is too strong. That's such a good point. Cabbage, too. Also very fart smelling. But so delicious. Like, I feel like it's totally fine when you eat it at home. Yeah. No one's going to judge you at home. They're like, oh, you're hitting us on dumplings. Like, can I get some? Yeah.
[00:21:49.590] 但我就想，我虽然很爱吃饺子，但我绝对不会让我妈逼我带饺子去学校。这是我愿意做出的牺牲，因为饺子的味道实在太浓了。你说得太对了。卷心菜也是。闻起来也像放屁一样。但真的很好吃。我觉得在家吃就完全没问题。对。没人会评判你。他们会说，哦，你又在吃饺子了。然后问，我可以吃点吗？可以。
[00:22:18.170] But outside you might be called dumpling farts, dude. Never be safe. Well, back to our thoughts on new year reflections and goals and stuff. We actually have a big announcement for the podcast, which is aligned with a lot of these upcoming things and goals that we've set for ourselves. And it's kind of bittersweet, but we've decided that we will upload every two weeks now instead of every week.
[00:22:18.170] 但你在外面可能会被人叫做“放屁饺子”，老兄。永远不要掉以轻心。好了，言归正传，说说新年反思、目标之类的。我们其实有个关于播客的重要消息要宣布，这和我们为自己设定的许多未来计划和目标都息息相关。这有点让人五味杂陈，但我们决定以后改为每两周更新一次，而不是每周一次。
[00:22:48.130] And honestly, part of this is because I was looking at our calendar when we were starting to plan out January. And I was like, I think it's physically impossible, literally impossible for us to release an episode every week due to our upcoming work schedules, travel schedules, and just personal things coming up. Yeah. It's just a very bittersweet decision that we had to make. Yeah.
[00:22:48.130] 说实话，部分原因是，我们在开始规划一月份的日程时，我看了看我们的日历。然后我就想，考虑到我们接下来的工作安排、旅行计划以及一些个人事务，我们真的不可能每周都发布一集。是的。这是一个我们不得不做出的令人百感交集的决定。
[00:23:14.710] And I hope to think that with us reducing the frequency of our episode uploads, we could focus on bringing more quality episodes to you guys. So hopefully the love and passion that we always pour into this podcast, you'll still feel it just as strong. But we will miss grinding to put our weekly episodes up. It will be a somewhat of a bigger change for us, I think. It was crazy too, because I remember when we were planning out the next couple months after
[00:23:14.710] 我希望通过降低节目上传频率，我们能够专注于为大家带来更多高质量的节目。希望大家仍然能感受到我们一直以来倾注在播客中的热爱和热情。但我们会怀念每周努力制作节目的日子。我想，这对我们来说将是一个相当大的改变。想想当初我们计划接下来几个月的时候，真是令人感慨万千。
[00:23:44.430] we made the decision already, we kind of stopped in the middle and we were like, oh my god, if we had to release an episode every single week, we would have to record on the plane or something. This podcast would have to go global. So I guess just know that a lot of this is logistical. But also at the same time, I think it's just, you know, it's been about almost six years now that we've been running this podcast.
[00:23:44.430] 我们之前已经做过决定了，只是做到一半的时候我们停下来想，天哪，如果每周都要更新一集，那我们岂不是得在飞机上录？这个播客必须走向全球。所以我想说的是，很多事情都跟后勤有关。但同时，我也觉得，你知道，我们做这个播客已经快六年了。
[00:24:10.570] So you and I are on the completely opposite end of the 20s spectrum now in terms of age, like a ton has changed over the years. So I think this is just one of those changes. It really did make us reflect a lot on the podcast too. We're like, wow, we put a lot of ourselves into it. And it also really is just a reflection of, like you said, us getting older, things changing
[00:24:10.570] 所以，你我如今在年龄上完全处于二十多岁的两端，这些年变化真的很大。我觉得这只是其中之一。这也确实让我们对播客进行了很多反思。我们心想，哇，我们投入了太多心血。而且，就像你说的，这也反映了我们渐渐变老，一切都在改变。
[00:24:38.010] and sometimes change as much as you might not want it just like has to happen. So hopefully you guys still continue to tune in with us just at a slightly slower cadence now. And we will, of course, still continue to put out our Eat Your Crust content for you. Oh my god. But also back to like non podcast related resolutions. I have a confession to make. Oh, so last year when we talked about like goals and resolutions and everything, I mentioned
[00:24:38.010] 有时候，即使你不情愿，事情也会发生变化，这是必然的。所以，希望你们还能继续收听我们的节目，只是频率可能会稍微慢一些。当然，我们也会继续为大家带来“Eat Your Crust”的内容。我的天哪。不过，还是回到与播客无关的话题吧。我得坦白一件事。哦，去年我们聊到目标、计划等等的时候，我提到过……
[00:25:07.350] how I have this like one camera that I think is broken and I want to get it checked out to see if it's fixable or not. And you were like, I'll give yourself the full year. Yes. And my confession is that I never did it. Are you gonna make it a recurring resolution this year? Yes, actually, I do still want to get it checked to see if it's fixable or not. I think I need to move it.
[00:25:07.350] 我有个相机，我觉得坏了，想拿去检查一下能不能修好。你当时说，我给你一整年的时间。是的。但我承认，我一直没去。你今年打算把它列入新年计划吗？是的，其实我还是想拿去检查一下，看看能不能修好。我觉得我得挪个地方再去。
[00:25:36.770] So what I did is I put it where like all my keys are and stuff to remind myself every day. But I guess just being there every day, you grow blind to it, right? It's just another piece of decor. Right. Right. So I need to maybe move it every like week as a constant reminder to myself. It's like elf on the shelf, but just task version. Yeah, exactly. Damn. Honestly, though, who can even blame you?
[00:25:36.770] 所以我把它放在我放钥匙之类的东西的地方，每天提醒自己。但我想，每天都放在那里，你会慢慢习惯，对吧？它就只是个装饰品而已。对。对。所以我可能需要每周挪一下它的位置，时刻提醒自己。就像是任务版的“精灵在架子上”。没错，就是这样。哎。不过说真的，谁又能怪你呢？
[00:26:03.830] As you were talking about that, I was trying to recall what my New Year's resolutions were last year. And I do not have much recollection of what my goals were. We should have listened back to our episode. We should have. But you know, I do have a different resolution this year, which I feel like is a little bit more doable. And it's just drinking more water. Being the peak consumer I am, I went and bought a 40 ounce handheld tumbler for the house
[00:26:03.830] 你刚才说到这儿，我正努力回想去年我的新年计划是什么。但我几乎想不起来了。我们应该回听一下我们那期节目的。真的应该。不过，你知道吗，我今年的新年计划不一样了，我觉得更容易实现。那就是多喝水。我可是个十足的消费者，所以我特意去买了一个40盎司的保温杯放在家里。
[00:26:31.050] and then another one just like it for my workplace so that I won't have an excuse of like, oh, I forgot to grab water. It's always just sitting at my desk staring me in the face. And it's honestly been helping a lot. I do feel like I'm getting way more water intake just being reminded to fill up these tumblers. But the one downside is I feel like I'm constantly peeing. You know what? I know that feeling too. That used to be my number one complaint about drinking more water.
[00:26:31.050] 然后我又买了一个一样的放在办公室，这样我就没借口说“哦，我忘了喝水了”。它就一直放在我的办公桌上，时刻提醒着我。说实话，这真的很有帮助。感觉只要提醒我把水杯装满，我的饮水量就明显增加了。不过，唯一的缺点就是我感觉自己老是想小便。你知道吗？我也懂这种感觉。这曾经是我喝水最大的抱怨。
[00:27:01.050] Like then I have to constantly run to the bathroom. Right. But I guess you just have to get used to it. That's true. And I try to tell myself like, at least I'm like getting up and like moving. That's true. But sometimes I'll be peeing and I'll be like, damn, I feel like I was just here. Feels like just 10 minutes ago that I was on this toilet. Or like how many hours of this day have I spent in the bathroom? I so agree that having a big water bottle just at your desk helps a lot.
[00:27:01.050] 那样的话我就得不停地跑厕所了。没错。不过我想你只能慢慢习惯了。确实如此。我会告诉自己，至少我还能起身活动活动。没错。但有时候我上完厕所会想，天哪，感觉我好像才刚来过。感觉好像十分钟前我还在马桶上。或者我会想，今天我到底在厕所里待了多少个小时？我非常同意，在办公桌上放一大瓶水真的很有帮助。
[00:27:31.250] At work, I don't have that. So I actually forget to drink water more often than at home. Yeah, honestly, I feel like having one at work is the true game changer. Because you have bottles and like glasses that you like at home. But at work, sometimes I'm like, oh, I don't know if I want to use the communal thing or like waste a whole plastic cup. So just having my own designated thing, it just makes it so easy. And I just wash it every once in a while. Well, redacted on how often I wash it.
[00:27:31.250] 在公司我没有那种杯子。所以实际上，我在公司喝水比在家更容易忘记喝。说实话，我觉得在公司有个杯子真的改变了一切。因为在家你可以用自己喜欢的瓶子和杯子。但在公司，有时候我会想，哎，我不知道是该用公用的杯子，还是该浪费一个塑料杯。所以，有了自己的专属杯子，就方便多了。我偶尔会洗一下。嗯，至于我多久洗一次，就不说了。
[00:28:01.110] I try to remind myself to wash it every now and then. I love how vague we're keeping it. Fill in the place. It's like Mad Libs. But dude, honestly, I know that I've just shared that I have all these health and wellness related New Year's resolutions this year. But it really gets me thinking, do I even know what it feels like to feel healthy? And what I mean by that is not just like, oh, I've been unhealthy my whole life.
[00:28:01.110] 我尽量提醒自己时不时洗洗。我喜欢这种模棱两可的表达方式。自己填空吧，就像玩填字游戏一样。不过说真的，我知道我刚才说过我今年有很多和健康养生相关的新年计划。但这真的让我开始思考，我真的知道健康是什么感觉吗？我的意思不是那种“哦，我这辈子一直都不健康”的情况。
[00:28:30.830] But it's really more like, am I seeing visible impact in my life from drinking more water or going to sleep earlier? Like, how do I measure that and what's my baseline? I just feel some people are so in tune with their bodies and they know exactly when they're not feeling well and exactly when they're feeling fine. But for me, I think that line is a little bit blurry. Maybe through my health adventures this year, I'll know what it means to really feel good and really feel bad and feel normal or whatnot.
[00:28:30.830] 但实际上，我更关心的是，多喝水或早睡是否真的能给我的生活带来明显的影响？我该如何衡量这些影响，我的基准线又是什么？我觉得有些人对自己的身体非常了解，他们能准确地分辨出自己什么时候感觉不舒服，什么时候感觉良好。但对我来说，这条界限有点模糊。或许通过今年的健康探索，我能真正体会到感觉良好、感觉糟糕、感觉正常等等这些概念的含义。
[00:28:58.270] But I think even starting to define that is a big task that I want to tackle before I hit 30. Honestly, that's a good point. I'm not sure if I am that in tune with it either. But also, I guess we've been driven by like, I don't know what to call it, like the extreme health of being young. Right. I'm sure we'll feel it more with the years because I think I do, for example, feel it more now if I don't get proper sleep. Right.
[00:28:58.270] 但我认为，即便只是开始定义它，也是一项艰巨的任务，我想在30岁之前完成。说实话，你说得对。我也不确定自己是否真的了解它。而且，我想我们一直以来都受到某种……我不知道该怎么形容，就像年轻时那种极致的健康状态。没错。我相信随着年龄增长，我们会更强烈地感受到这一点，因为我觉得，比如，如果我睡眠不足，我现在就会更明显地感觉到。没错。
[00:29:27.490] And it definitely affects me. But things like water and stuff like that, I'm like, I don't know. Is this headache because I didn't drink water or is it just because I've been staring at screens all day? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It is hard to tell sometimes. I know. And maybe that's why stuff like aura rings or all these wearable health devices are so trendy right now. Because I guess one of the appeals of the aura ring is it'll tell you your readiness score for the day or something like that.
[00:29:27.490] 这确实会影响到我。但像喝水之类的事情，我就想，我也不知道。这头疼是因为没喝水，还是因为我一整天都在盯着屏幕？是啊，没错。有时候真的很难说。我知道。也许这就是为什么像能量戒指之类的可穿戴健康设备现在这么流行的原因吧。因为我觉得能量戒指的吸引力之一就是它可以告诉你当天的状态评分之类的。
[00:29:55.150] Be like, oh, you are feeling tired because you didn't get enough sleep or whatever. And it just like clearly defines it. But to a certain extent, I'm like, I feel like I should be knowing how to define this. Yeah. I feel like the most I can do is like, oh, today I don't feel so great. Why? These are some possibilities, but nothing is for certain. Sometimes I feel like the reasons that I think of on why I don't feel so great aren't internal.
[00:29:55.150] 比如，你会说，哦，你感觉累是因为睡眠不足之类的。这样就能很清楚地解释原因了。但在某种程度上，我觉得我应该知道如何定义这种感觉才对。是啊。我觉得我能做的最多就是，哦，我今天感觉不太好。为什么呢？这些是一些可能的原因，但没有什么是确定的。有时候我觉得，我所想到的那些感觉不好的原因，其实并非源于内心。
[00:30:23.350] Like sometimes I might be like, oh, I don't I think I'm like stressed or like I think it's this and that without thinking about like health reasons first. Yeah. Is this like aging? Oh, my God. I guess it is. But you're right. We definitely need to build these healthier habits, especially as we get close to 30, because just everything is, you know, slowing down as we get to 30. So morbid. It feels scary.
[00:30:23.350] 有时候我可能会想，哦，我好像压力很大，或者觉得是这样那样的原因，却没先考虑健康方面的问题。是啊。这算是衰老吗？我的天哪。我想是的。但你说得对。我们确实需要养成更健康的生活习惯，尤其是在快到30岁的时候，因为你知道，到了30岁，一切都会慢下来。真让人难过。感觉有点可怕。
[00:30:50.070] But I guess at the same time, from what I've seen, a lot of people love being in their 30s. So it's scary, but also exciting. Yeah, I think it's just it's just a different chapter in your life. I feel this way even when I go to like Whole Foods or something. And I think if I were to grocery shop in my early 20s, I would have grabbed a tin of blueberries because I like the way they taste. And then a bottle of pomegranate juice because the packaging is cute.
[00:30:50.070] 但我觉得与此同时，就我观察，很多人都很享受三十多岁的时光。所以既让人害怕，又让人兴奋。是啊，我觉得这只是人生中的一个新篇章。即使我去像全食超市（Whole Foods）这样的超市，也会有这种感觉。我想如果我二十出头的时候去超市买东西，我会买一罐蓝莓，因为我喜欢蓝莓的味道。还会买一瓶石榴汁，因为包装很可爱。
[00:31:17.910] But now that I'm in my late 20s, I grab the blueberries because they're full of antioxidants. And same thing for the pomegranate juice. Like it's so good for clearing out toxins or whatever. Just like the reasons are different, even though my actions are the same. And oh, my God. The last time we entered a new decade was 10 years ago. Oh, God. All in all, I feel like 2025 is going to be a somewhat of a crazy year.
[00:31:17.910] 但现在我快三十岁了，我会吃蓝莓，因为它们富含抗氧化剂。石榴汁也是一样，好像对排毒什么的特别好。虽然我的行为方式一样，但原因却不一样了。天哪，我们上次进入新的十年还是十年前呢。我的天啊。总而言之，我觉得2025年将会是相当疯狂的一年。
[00:31:45.750] Half of me feels like it's going to be like a reset year. And the other half of me feels like there's going to be a lot of dynamic changes that we will commit ourselves to as well. Maybe next year for our New Year's resolutions episode, we'll have to come back to this and see if we truly live like a health as well. Then be better at work kind of a year. But for now, I think these are good goals. I hope so. I hope we look back at this episode and we're like, oh, yeah, we did everything that was important.
[00:31:45.750] 一半我觉得今年会像是一个重置之年。另一半我觉得我们会做出很多积极的改变，并且会全身心投入其中。也许明年的新年计划特辑里，我们会再来回顾一下，看看我们是否真的能过上健康的生活，并在工作中取得更大的进步。但就目前而言，我认为这些都是很好的目标。我希望如此。我希望我们回顾这一期节目时，会觉得，哦，是的，我们已经完成了所有重要的事情。
