[00:00:00.320] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Taneah. Welcome back, Taneah. The last time you were on the podcast was episode 207, Internships and Intern Season, which was pretty fun.
[00:00:00.320] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Taneah。欢迎回来，Taneah。你上次做客是第207期节目，主题是实习和实习季，那期节目很有意思。
[00:00:25.070] We reflected on what it was like to be interns now that we're, I guess, seasoned full-time employees. But being an intern, I feel like is a pretty special time. But today we have a pretty fun topic, I think, to talk about, which is the
[00:00:25.070] 我们回顾了当初做实习生时的感受，现在我们都算是经验丰富的正式员工了。我觉得实习是一段非常特别的时光。不过今天我们要聊的话题很有趣，那就是……
[00:00:42.710] concept of fangirling or being obsessed with some sort of celebrity. I think we've all had phases or times where we've been super into a celebrity or like a group of celebrities. We thought it would be fun to just talk a little bit about the why behind it for
[00:00:42.710] 追星，或者说痴迷于某个名人，这种概念很常见。我想我们都曾有过一段时间，特别迷恋某个名人或某个名人团体。我们觉得聊聊这种现象背后的原因会很有趣。
[00:01:02.070] ourselves, as well as, I guess, just gushing about our obsessions for a little bit. Yeah, this episode is actually an excuse for us to talk about our obsessions and just obsess over them even further.
[00:01:02.070] 我们自己，还有，我想，就是想稍微聊聊我们痴迷的东西。没错，这期节目其实就是让我们有机会谈谈我们的痴迷之处，并且更加深入地探讨它们。
[00:01:14.510] But to kind of kick this episode off, I do want to ask both of you what draws you to someone famous? Like, what do you think pulls you in in that initial obsession period? I think usually my obsessions start with either they're a singer or an
[00:01:14.510] 但为了开启这期节目，我想问问你们两位，是什么吸引你们关注某个名人？比如，你们觉得最初迷恋他们的是什么？我觉得我通常迷恋的对象要么是歌手，要么是……
[00:01:30.670] actor. And it's just their charm during interviews, the way that they talk to the reporter or whatever. I think that's what initially draws me in. The reason I say it's not because of their character that they play is because
[00:01:30.670] 演员。还有他们在采访中的魅力，他们和记者交谈的方式等等。我想这才是最初吸引我的地方。我说这并非因为他们扮演的角色，而是因为……
[00:01:43.590] recently I'm watching House of the Dragon and I'm obsessed with the actor that plays Egon. Oh, yeah. He's crazy in House of the Dragon, obviously, but in real life, he's just so charming and he has a cute little accent. I'm like, oh my gosh, you are so adorable.
[00:01:43.590] 最近我在看《龙之家族》，我迷上了饰演伊贡的那个演员。哦，对了。他在《龙之家族》里当然是个疯子，但现实生活中他真的太有魅力了，而且还有点可爱的口音。我当时就想，我的天哪，你真是太可爱了。
[00:02:02.870] So it's definitely the charm during interviews that gets me. Yeah, I think I'm similar to you where it's not necessarily like the character that someone plays that initially draws me in. I think it is what's behind that, like the person behind that.
[00:02:02.870] 所以，真正吸引我的肯定是面试时的魅力。是的，我觉得我和你很像，最初吸引我的未必是某人扮演的角色，而是角色背后的人，是角色背后的那个人。
[00:02:20.270] I think for me, it's like skill usually is like the first thing. So if I think someone is a really good singer, that's something that initially draws me in. And then, you know, I start watching more of their performances or maybe if
[00:02:20.270] 我觉得对我来说，技巧通常是最重要的。所以如果我觉得某人唱歌很好听，这首先就会吸引我。然后，你知道，我会开始看他们更多的表演，或者如果
[00:02:34.390] it's an actor who I think is really good at acting, I'll want to watch more of their shows or movies. And then from there, it just exponentially snowballs and grows. And then I'm like, wait, why do I know so much about this person?
[00:02:34.390] 我觉得这位演员演技真的很好，所以我会想看他/她更多的剧集或电影。然后，就像滚雪球一样，越滚越大。接着我就会想，等等，我怎么会对这个人了解这么多？
[00:02:50.390] I think for me, I actually do really care about the character that's being played when it comes to being an actor. So I think I've talked about this on this podcast before, but I had a huge succession phase maybe like a year or so ago now.
[00:02:50.390] 我觉得对我来说，作为一名演员，我确实很在意自己扮演的角色。我之前在这个播客里也谈到过这一点，大概一年前，我经历了一个重要的角色转换阶段。
[00:03:05.350] And I just fell into this huge rabbit hole with the guy who plays Kendall Roy, Jeremy Strong. I knew for some reason you were going to say Kendall out of all the people. I don't know why.
[00:03:05.350] 我突然就迷上了饰演肯德尔·罗伊的杰瑞米·斯特朗。不知为何，我就知道你会从那么多人里挑出肯德尔来。我也不知道为什么。
[00:03:18.950] OK, I feel like that character in particular, like breeds fangirling and obsession because it's like such an imperfect character. He, at many points of the show, is one of the main characters and like, you know, is really like feeling the narrative.
[00:03:18.950] 我觉得这个角色特别容易引发粉丝的追捧和痴迷，因为他本身就是一个不完美的角色。在剧中的很多时候，他都是主角之一，而且你知道，他真的能感受到剧情的发展。
[00:03:34.550] And I don't know, I just find him like so attractive. But I think from my obsession was so strong. And if I think about my past obsessions as well, I had a huge like top from Big Bang phase and I was definitely also drawn in from the looks.
[00:03:34.550] 我也不知道为什么，就是觉得他特别有魅力。我觉得我对他的迷恋太强烈了。想想我以前迷恋过的人，比如Big Bang时期，我曾经特别迷恋他们，肯定也是被他们的外表吸引的。
[00:03:51.830] So I think I'm just a very visual learner. Wait, Taneh, have you seen Succession? Yeah, I have. I'm like laughing on the side because I'm like, oh, Kendall, what the heck? If you were to be obsessed with someone from Succession, who do you think it would be?
[00:03:51.830] 所以我觉得我就是个视觉型学习者。等等，塔内，你看过《继承之战》吗？看过。我当时在一旁偷笑，心想，肯德尔，你这是怎么了？如果你要迷恋《继承之战》里的某个人，你觉得会是谁？
[00:04:12.990] Yeah, I was I was also thinking about that. And then it kind of made sense in my head because out of all the characters, I feel like I would also be obsessed with Kendall. So Jisoo, I get it. Fine. Justice for Jisoo has been delivered.
[00:04:12.990] 是啊，我也在想这个问题。后来我突然明白了，因为在所有角色里，我觉得我也会特别迷恋Kendall。所以Jisoo，我懂了。好吧。Jisoo的冤屈终于得到了伸张。
[00:04:27.630] I'm accepted in this world. I guess I can kind of make sense of it. So I haven't watched the last season of Succession yet, but I feel like Kendall is the guy who wants to succeed but is knocked down a lot.
[00:04:27.630] 我被这个世界接纳了。我想我多少能理解这一切。我还没看过《继承之战》最后一季，但我感觉肯德尔就是那种渴望成功却屡遭挫折的人。
[00:04:43.430] And maybe that cycle is something that makes you want to root for him. I'm not sure. I think that makes sense. And I guess also going back to the character being compelling part, I realize that I'm very into the character where they're like the underdog and they're
[00:04:43.430] 或许正是这种循环让你想要支持他。我不确定。我觉得这说得通。而且，说到角色本身引人入胜这一点，我意识到我非常喜欢那种处于劣势的角色，他们就像……
[00:04:59.390] like trying really hard, but things don't always work out perfectly for them. So I think that is also what makes me stay. I'm like, oh, is this person also an underdog in real life? Has this person played similar characters?
[00:04:59.390] 就像他们非常努力，但事情并不总是尽如人意。所以我觉得这也是我留下来的原因。我会想，哦，这个人现实生活中也是个弱势群体吗？这个人演过类似的角色吗？
[00:05:12.430] And then I go through their whole history, I guess. Yeah. In terms of character, I'm more drawn to people who are like, not the bad guy, but like they're good, but they could be bad sort of vibe.
[00:05:12.430] 然后我就会仔细研究他们的过往经历。是的。就性格而言，我更喜欢那种不是坏人，而是善良但又有可能变坏的人。
[00:05:26.470] For example, I recently watched the show The Gentleman on Netflix with Theo James, beautiful man, very cute. And he's like this nice, posh little English dude that gets dragged into the marijuana game in England. And I don't know, just something about the way he handles stress and pressure.
[00:05:26.470] 例如，我最近在Netflix上看了《绅士们》，主演是西奥·詹姆斯，他长得真帅，非常可爱。他演的是一个风度翩翩、举止优雅的英国绅士，却意外卷入了英国的毒品交易。我不知道，就是他处理压力和焦虑的方式让我觉得很特别。
[00:05:47.310] I'm like, wow, you are so attractive right now. And even when I was watching Peaky Blinders, which is about basically a gang in Birmingham in the UK, I was obsessed with Thomas Shelby who's played by Cillian Murphy. Oh my gosh.
[00:05:47.310] 我当时就想，哇，你现在真是太有魅力了。就连我看《浴血黑帮》（Peaky Blinders）的时候，这部剧讲的是英国伯明翰的一个黑帮，我都迷上了希里安·墨菲饰演的托马斯·谢尔比。我的天哪。
[00:06:01.950] I was like, your accent, the way again that you're handling all these other bad dudes is amazing. So I think that's the type of character I enjoy in Fanclub over. You like the cool, calm and collected guy. Yeah. But you're right. Thomas Shelby is a little morally gray.
[00:06:01.950] 我当时就想，你的口音，还有你对付其他坏蛋的方式，真是太棒了。所以我觉得这就是我喜欢《Fanclub》里那种角色的原因。你喜欢那种冷静沉着、处变不惊的人。没错。但你说得对，托马斯·谢尔比的道德底线有点灰色地带。
[00:06:21.630] Yeah. And I think that's what makes everything so interesting, even as you're watching the show, aside from the actor itself that's playing it, morally gray characters just keep you on your toes and you're like, that's not okay, like what you just
[00:06:21.630] 是啊。我觉得这正是这部剧如此引人入胜的原因，即使你看剧的时候，除了演员本身的表演之外，那些亦正亦邪的角色也会让你时刻保持警惕，你会觉得，这不对劲，就像你刚才说的……
[00:06:34.030] did, but I don't know, there's something about you that I'm like, it's okay. It's fine. Do whatever you want to do. I feel like in a way, things like that, where you're kind of questioning, are you really the good person or a bad person? That's what's compelling, right?
[00:06:34.030] 确实如此，但我不知道，你身上有种特质让我觉得，没关系，没关系，你想做什么就做什么。我觉得在某种程度上，正是这种让你质疑自己究竟是好人还是坏人的事情，才是真正吸引人的地方，对吧？
[00:06:48.070] Like that's, what's interesting and makes them a more real character versus someone who always plays some sort of shtick of like, oh, I'm always the good guy or I'm always the bad guy. And it's kind of with like Kendall as well, to be honest, to go back to
[00:06:48.070] 正是这一点让角色更有趣，也更真实，而不是像有些人那样总是扮演某种固定的角色，比如“我总是好人”或“我总是坏人”。说实话，肯德尔的情况也有点类似，回到过去……
[00:06:59.990] succession where there are some points where you are rooting for him because he is trying to do the right thing. And then sometimes he just does something that's completely bizarre and you're like, why, why did you do that? You know?
[00:06:59.990] 这部剧里，有时候你会支持他，因为他努力想做正确的事。但有时候他又会做出一些完全莫名其妙的事，你会想，为什么，你为什么要这么做？你懂的吧？
[00:07:10.350] So I feel like, yeah, that's what makes a good character. Yeah. That makes sense. In terms of character, I think I'm drawn to usually like the main character or someone who has, yeah, I guess like you guys said, a compelling
[00:07:10.350] 所以我觉得，没错，这就是好角色的特质。嗯，有道理。就角色而言，我通常会被主角或者那种，嗯，就像你们说的，有吸引力的人所吸引。
[00:07:26.950] story or maybe like they're just very charming in the show. When I watch a show, I really like get sucked into the world and I'm like, I become the main character. I'm like thinking, wow, if that were me, you know, like what would I be doing?
[00:07:26.950] 或许是因为剧情，或许是因为他们在剧中真的很有魅力。我看剧的时候，很容易沉浸在那个世界里，感觉自己就像是主角。我会想，哇，如果那是我，我会做什么呢？
[00:07:41.510] So I think it has to also have some sort of relatability. And I think that's where just like not always doing the right thing comes in play because you're like, oh yeah, I would probably like fuck this up too. Or like, I would make the mistake here.
[00:07:41.510] 所以我觉得它必须有一定的共鸣性。我觉得这就是“并非总是做正确的事”这个设定发挥作用的地方，因为你会想，哦，是啊，我可能也会把事情搞砸。或者，我也会犯同样的错误。
[00:07:53.110] Like, I don't even know what the right choice is. And so I think like having that relatability is a big thing. And I think that's a big thing in terms of my personal obsession slash fangirling for people.
[00:07:53.110] 我甚至不知道什么是正确的选择。所以我觉得能产生共鸣很重要。而且我觉得这对于我个人对某些人的痴迷/追星行为来说也至关重要。
[00:08:05.230] I think when I can see like some traits of myself in someone who is like, you know, famous and accomplished, I'm like, whoa, that's really cool to see. That means that people like me could succeed in a world like that. Oh, that's really interesting actually.
[00:08:05.230] 我觉得，当我在像我这样有名有成就的人身上看到自己的一些特质时，我会觉得，哇，这真的很酷。这意味着像我这样的人也能在那样的世界里取得成功。哦，这真的很有意思。
[00:08:20.950] I never thought about it like that, but I think you're totally right. If I look at the interviews or like the real life personas of people who I've really obsessed over, I feel like all of them are like slightly awkward in
[00:08:20.950] 我以前从没这么想过，但我觉得你说得完全对。如果我去看那些我特别着迷的人的采访或者他们在现实生活中的表现，我觉得他们好像都有点儿不善交际。
[00:08:32.310] a way. Like it's never the guy who's like winning over the host. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like someone who is maybe earnest and like funny, but not like the main character. And I feel like that's what makes them so much more real to me, too.
[00:08:32.310] 某种程度上来说。就像从来没有那种能赢得主持人芳心的角色。是啊。你明白我的意思吗？就像那种可能很真诚也很幽默，但又不是主角的人。我觉得也正是这一点，让他们在我眼里显得更加真实。
[00:08:44.030] So I think you do kind of seek out relatability points and people who aren't so like, I don't know, like super powerful. Yeah. I was going to say like someone who isn't as composed because even in
[00:08:44.030] 所以我觉得你会倾向于寻找能引起共鸣的地方，以及那些不那么……嗯，不太厉害的人。是的。我本来想说的是，像那种不那么沉着冷静的人，因为即使在……
[00:08:57.630] interviews when they're like messing around, I feel like that's really fun to watch and also relatable because it's just like you're chatting with your friends. Like you're never like formal or anything like that. I get the idea of liking somebody because they're not always like polished.
[00:08:57.630] 我觉得看他们轻松随意的采访特别有意思，也很有亲切感，就像和朋友聊天一样。完全没有那种正式感。我能理解为什么有人会喜欢那种不拘泥于形式的人。
[00:09:11.670] I feel like if they're too like PR perfect, it's just like clearly a, you know, creation of the Hollywood machine or, you know, something of that sort. There's like no mistakes and it's harder to relate to that for sure.
[00:09:11.670] 我觉得如果他们表现得太完美，就像公关稿里写的那样，那就很明显是好莱坞运作机制的产物，或者类似的产物。他们几乎不会犯任何错误，这样就很难让人产生共鸣。
[00:09:25.230] True. I also feel like there's a little bit more fun when you're obsessing over someone who's not like an A-list star, because when a more niche star has like a movie launching, you get so it because it's like so far and few in between. True.
[00:09:25.230] 没错。我也觉得，迷恋那些不是一线明星的人更有意思，因为当一个比较小众的明星有电影上映时，你会特别兴奋，因为这种机会实在太少了。没错。
[00:09:41.430] But then you have to wait a long time. That is also true. And also if you want to like consume their content, you can't do it immediately. Yeah. It's kind of hard. Dude, that's why you need someone who's not up and coming, but has
[00:09:41.430] 但那样你就得等很久。确实如此。而且，如果你想消费他们的内容，也不能马上就做。是啊，确实有点难。所以，你需要的是一个不是新人，而是已经……的人。
[00:09:55.510] already arrived a little bit. Like even if they're more niche, you know, maybe not A-list, but hopefully they have at least like a show under their belt or like, you know, a couple of movies so you can spend some time consuming that content or if they're a
[00:09:55.510] 已经有点起步了。即使他们比较小众，可能不是一线明星，但希望他们至少有一部剧集或者几部电影，这样你就可以花些时间欣赏他们的作品，或者如果他们是……
[00:10:14.390] singer, hopefully they have more than one album so that you don't have to just listen to one album on repeat. Do you ever fangirl over like singers in particular that don't necessarily have a media presence?
[00:10:14.390] 希望你喜欢的歌手不止一张专辑，这样你就不用一直循环播放同一张专辑了。你有没有特别喜欢一些不太活跃于媒体的歌手，甚至会像个小粉丝一样追星？
[00:10:26.990] Like do you fangirl over them through their voice or like how do you for singers, how do you usually like start the obsession? The singer that I was probably the most obsessed with was again, top from Big Bang slash Big Bang in general.
[00:10:26.990] 你是像追星族那样通过他们的声音来迷恋他们吗？或者说，你对歌手的迷恋通常是怎么开始的？我曾经最迷恋的歌手大概还是Big Bang的Top，或者说整个Big Bang组合。
[00:10:41.550] So for them and I think for Korean idols, like you kind of have to be out there. You have to be on variety shows to get really famous. So I grew up with a lot of Big Bang content, like so much so that I can
[00:10:41.550] 所以对他们来说，我觉得对韩国偶像来说也是如此，你必须走出去，必须上综艺节目才能真正出名。所以我从小就接触很多Big Bang的内容，多到我……
[00:10:54.910] confidently say that I've maybe watched like less than half of what's really out there. Like I know some people who really follow idols watch like every fan cam and every performance. Like I'm definitely not at that level. So I always had like an abundance of stuff to watch.
[00:10:54.910] 我可以很自信地说，我可能只看过不到一半的偶像视频。我知道有些追星族会看遍所有饭拍视频和演出。我肯定没那么狂热。所以我一直有很多东西可以看。
[00:11:08.510] Similar for me, the singer that I was most obsessed with is a K-pop person. Her name is Taeyeon and she's from Girls' Gen. She's like solo now. But like when I started to like really get into her, the group Girls' Gen already
[00:11:08.510] 跟我情况类似，我最迷恋的歌手是韩国流行歌手，名叫泰妍，是少女时代的成员。她现在是solo歌手了。但我真正开始喜欢上她的时候，少女时代组合已经很红了。
[00:11:23.270] ran like through their most popular time. So I was like, oh dude, there's like a gold mine of content here for me. Even though now as she's like solo, she has less content because she's like low key.
[00:11:23.270] 就像她们最火的时候那样。所以我就想，哇，这简直是个内容宝库啊。虽然现在她单飞了，内容少了，因为她比较低调。
[00:11:36.070] I'm just trying to sit at home and like chill and just like release music. So I thought that was like lucky, I guess in a sense. Like, oh, I still have all this content while she doesn't have to like work as
[00:11:36.070] 我只想待在家里放松放松，顺便发布点音乐。所以我觉得这在某种程度上还挺幸运的。就像，哦，我还有这么多作品可以创作，而她不用工作……
[00:11:46.310] hard as when she was younger in terms of like public appearances. I still remember in college, you used to always give me rides home from like GBM or something. You'd be like, Taneya, have you heard of this singer? And then you would put on Taeyeon.
[00:11:46.310] 她不像年轻时那样经常公开露面了。我还记得大学的时候，你总是开车送我回家，比如从GBM之类的演出回来。你会问：“泰妍，你听过这个歌手吗？”然后你就会放泰妍的歌。
[00:12:01.150] It was just so cute because you were obsessed. Like you were like talking about all the things that she did, blah, blah, blah. And it was just so cute. But yeah, she was a very good singer. Yeah, I enjoyed it. It's kind of an interesting story.
[00:12:01.150] 你当时那么痴迷她，真是太可爱了。你一直在说她做过的所有事，等等等等。真的太可爱了。不过，她唱歌确实很好听。嗯，我很喜欢。这故事挺有意思的。
[00:12:16.070] Like I took this K-pop class at school because I had to do like a music or art lower div and we learned about K-pop. And I was like, wow, I haven't listened to K-pop in so long.
[00:12:16.070] 我之前在学校选修了一门K-pop课，因为我当时必须选修一门音乐或艺术类的低年级课程，然后我们就学到了K-pop。我当时就想，哇，我已经很久没听过K-pop了。
[00:12:27.270] Last time was like middle school when some of my friends were really into it. Some of these songs were like bringing back memories. So I went home and I started deep diving into a bunch of like K-pop and like a bunch of like K-pop music videos.
[00:12:27.270] 上次我迷上K-pop还是在初中，那时候我的一些朋友特别喜欢K-pop。有些歌勾起了我的回忆。所以我回家后就开始深入研究各种K-pop歌曲和MV。
[00:12:40.910] And as most people know, these music videos are like very, very eye-catching. It's like easy to get sucked in. They're like super colorful, super vibrant. And so as I fell down that rabbit hole, I like discovered Girls' Gen literally so
[00:12:40.910] 大家都知道，这些音乐录影带非常非常吸睛，很容易让人沉迷其中。它们色彩绚丽，充满活力。就这样，我一头扎进了这个“兔子洞”，然后就发现了少女时代。
[00:12:55.870] late. And then I was like, wow, this one girl is like such a good singer in this group. And then that's like how the whole thing happened. So that's interesting to me because I feel like you almost had like a formal introduction into this obsession.
[00:12:55.870] 那天晚上很晚了。然后我就想，哇，这个组合里有个女孩唱歌真好听。事情大概就是这样发生的。我觉得这很有意思，因为感觉你好像是正式地开始迷上这种音乐了。
[00:13:08.790] But oftentimes I feel like we're introduced to so many celebrities, so many different actors, etc. But we're not obsessing over all of them, right? Even if they're talented or attractive. So what do you think it is about maybe a specific period in your life or like a
[00:13:08.790] 但很多时候我觉得我们接触到了很多名人，很多不同的演员等等。但我们并没有对他们所有人都着迷，对吧？即使他们很有才华或者外表出众。那么你觉得这跟你人生中的某个特定时期或者类似的事情有什么关系呢？
[00:13:23.870] specific mindset that you have that really helps you fall into that like fangirl obsession over someone? When I was in high school, I was really, really, really obsessed with One Direction. It was like kind of embarrassing, honestly.
[00:13:23.870] 你有什么特别的心态，让你很容易对某个人产生那种迷恋？我高中时，真的、真的、真的超级迷恋单向组合（One Direction）。说实话，现在想想有点尴尬。
[00:13:37.750] But one thing that kind of aided that or helped in that was they were on X Factor. So there was like a huge media presence and there were so many people that were already obsessed with them that it kind of like I would see it like everywhere.
[00:13:37.750] 但对他们走红起到一定作用的一点是，他们参加了《X Factor》。所以媒体曝光率很高，而且已经有很多人对他们着迷，以至于我几乎到处都能看到他们的身影。
[00:13:52.070] And that made me even more obsessed because, again, there was content with like formal content that their PR team is putting out, that they're doing interviews, etc. But then there are the fanfics. And there are all that those type of content that came out.
[00:13:52.070] 这让我更加着迷，因为一方面，他们的公关团队会发布一些正式的内容，比如采访等等。但另一方面，还有同人小说，以及所有这类内容。
[00:14:07.870] And my friend and I in high school, we used to literally send each other fanfics about One Direction, specifically like I loved Harry and she loved Zayn. So we would individually each read fanfics about Harry or Zayn.
[00:14:07.870] 我和我朋友高中时经常互相分享关于单向乐队的同人小说，我喜欢哈里，她喜欢泽恩。所以我们会各自阅读关于哈里或泽恩的同人小说。
[00:14:23.950] And it was just such a like crazy world to be a part of because there's already all these super crazy fans that are producing like honestly really good stories. So it just helped in that session.
[00:14:23.950] 能身处这样一个疯狂的世界真是太棒了，因为那里已经聚集了一群超级狂热的粉丝，他们创作出了很多非常精彩的故事。所以，这对那次交流很有帮助。
[00:14:36.550] Well, I totally feel that the first point you said for sure, like when this group or person is on the rise and they're just being like force fed to everyone through media, you know, we used to listen to radio a lot more and then people would just
[00:14:36.550] 嗯，我完全同意你说的第一点，就像当某个群体或个人走红时，媒体会像洗脑一样把他们强行灌输给所有人，你知道，我们以前经常听广播，那时候人们就……
[00:14:49.510] like spam their songs on radio. Chappelle Roan is like the biggest thing right now. So then just like spam her songs on radio or something like that. I think there might have been some point in high school where I would like change the
[00:14:49.510] 就像在电台里狂刷他们的歌。Chappelle Roan现在可火了。所以就一直在电台里狂刷她的歌之类的。我觉得高中时我可能也想过要改变……
[00:15:00.150] station. Every single station is playing the One Direction song or something. And you know what's crazy is now when like every other station is like playing another big artist like Taylor Swift, I'm just like I need to shut off the radio.
[00:15:00.150] 电台。每个电台都在放One Direction的歌之类的。你知道最疯狂的是什么吗？现在当其他电台都在放像泰勒·斯威夫特这样的大牌歌手的歌时，我就只想把收音机关掉。
[00:15:14.110] But back then when they were playing One Direction, I was like, keep it coming. Like don't stop. And now I get how people feel when they were hearing One Direction because they were probably like this is madness. But I loved it back then. It was great.
[00:15:14.110] 但那时候他们放One Direction的歌时，我就想，继续放，别停。现在我能理解人们当时听到One Direction的感受了，他们可能觉得这太疯狂了。但我当时很喜欢，真的太棒了。
[00:15:27.350] I think also you're right, like fanfic has extremely powerful pull. It's like not spoken of as much, especially when we were in high school. But I think now people are truly starting to recognize the power of fanfic.
[00:15:27.350] 我觉得你说得对，同人小说确实有着非常强大的影响力。虽然以前很少有人谈论它，尤其是在我们上高中的时候。但我认为现在人们开始真正意识到同人小说的力量了。
[00:15:45.790] And actually Jisoo and I were recently talking about how like Fifty Shades of Grey was originally like a Twilight fanfic, right? And we're like, dude, that was like the first time ever where it was like, you can do this like with fanfic. This has like that much power.
[00:15:45.790] 其实我和Jisoo最近在聊，《五十度灰》最初其实是《暮光之城》的同人小说，对吧？我们当时就觉得，老兄，这好像是第一次证明，同人小说也能做到这种程度。它竟然有这么大的力量。
[00:16:00.110] It can become public and like a movie, like a franchise. I feel like we could even almost do a whole separate episode about fanfic, but I totally feel you on like fanfic really pulling you in and like keeping you there for a
[00:16:00.110] 它可以公开，就像电影一样，像一个系列。我觉得我们甚至可以专门做一整期关于同人小说的节目，但我完全理解你说的，同人小说真的能把你吸引进去，让你沉迷其中。
[00:16:16.430] little bit because one, it's endless content and you can be as Delulu as you want because it's like fictional, right? You don't need images or like videos of it. Like it's all just like written out there.
[00:16:16.430] 有点儿，因为首先，内容无穷无尽，你可以尽情地幻想，因为它就像虚构的故事，对吧？你不需要图片或视频之类的东西。一切都像文字一样直接呈现在眼前。
[00:16:26.510] For me, Big Bang was definitely on the rise in like middle school, but they didn't have that many fanfics. So then what I would do is I would read Dongbangshinki fanfics and this was like the boy group that came out before Big Bang.
[00:16:26.510] 对我来说，Big Bang 在我上初中的时候就开始火了，但是他们的同人小说并不多。所以我就会去看东邦神基的同人小说，东邦神基是 Big Bang 之前出道的一个男团。
[00:16:40.150] So there was already like a huge catalog. So I would like sometimes read all the Big Bang ones. I'm like, oh shit, there's not that many left. So then I would read the Dongbangshinki ones and then like just imagine that they were the Outspach of the Big Bang.
[00:16:40.150] 所以当时已经有非常庞大的目录了。有时候我会把《宇宙大爆炸》系列都读一遍。然后我就想，糟了，剩下的不多了。于是我就去读《东方神起》系列，然后想象它们是《宇宙大爆炸》的后继之作。
[00:17:00.310] Just out of like sheer desperation, you know? But it's so interesting thinking back because that was like the first time I learned what like a TXT file was because back then, like Korean fanfics, they were all TXT file.
[00:17:00.310] 纯粹是出于绝望，你知道吗？但现在回想起来很有意思，因为那是我第一次知道TXT文件是什么，因为那时候，像韩国同人小说，它们都是TXT文件格式的。
[00:17:14.470] And then I would push it in my tiny little MP3 and like read it on my own. Oh my god. So, you know, you're learning a lot of stuff from fanfics back in the day. That was like a true technology lesson too. Oh my god.
[00:17:14.470] 然后我就把它放进我那小小的MP3播放器里，自己读。我的天哪。所以，你知道，那时候你从同人小说里学到了很多东西。那也算是一堂真正的技术课。我的天哪。
[00:17:29.710] No, Jisoo, I feel that though. Like it was so nice because it made the person that you're obsessed with so real in like the most bizarre way. Like as you said, you can be as Doolooloo as you want.
[00:17:29.710] 不，Jisoo，我也有这种感觉。感觉很棒，因为它以一种奇特的方式，让你迷恋的人变得如此真实。就像你说的，你可以尽情地做你自己。
[00:17:39.150] So like in these like Harry Styles fanfics, he's like the sweetest, most charismatic guy, blah, blah, blah. You know, and it was just so fun to fantasize about that. And also I learned because I know we were talking about Fifty Shades of Grey.
[00:17:39.150] 就像那些哈里·斯泰尔斯的同人小说里，他被描绘成最温柔、最有魅力的男人，等等等等。你知道，幻想这些真的很有趣。而且，因为我知道我们之前聊过《五十度灰》，所以我也学到了一些东西。
[00:17:54.270] I learned that there's this book series called After... Oh my god, I know the series. Yeah, I forgot what it's called. You're right. I think the first one is like After and then the second one is like... After We Fall or something. Yeah, something like that.
[00:17:54.270] 我听说有一套书叫《之后》……哦，我的天，我知道这套书。对，我忘了叫什么了。你说得对。我想第一本叫《之后》，第二本叫……《我们坠落之后》之类的。对，差不多是这样。
[00:18:08.790] That started out as a fanfic based on Harry Styles. Oh. And I didn't know that. And so when I found out, I was like, oh my gosh, do I relive my obsession with Harry Styles? Wait, don't watch the movies.
[00:18:08.790] 那最初是根据哈里·斯泰尔斯写的同人小说。哦。我之前不知道。所以当我发现的时候，我就想，我的天哪，难道我要重拾对哈里·斯泰尔斯的迷恋吗？等等，千万别看电影。
[00:18:22.310] I actually did start watching the movies and it was god awful. So I didn't finish. So the only reason I know this, the movies, because usually these are like, you know, cute rom-com-ish stories. One of our friends, she's a sucker for those kinds of movies.
[00:18:22.310] 我确实开始看这些电影了，结果烂到家了。所以我没看完。我之所以知道这些电影，是因为它们通常都是那种轻松甜蜜的爱情喜剧。我们有个朋友特别喜欢这类电影。
[00:18:38.590] And so we saw the trailer for it and she's like, oh my god, that looks enticing. Like let's go watch it. So we went and watched the movie and we're like, oh, like this movie probably did not quite portray...
[00:18:38.590] 于是我们看了预告片，她就说，天哪，这看起来太吸引人了。我们去看吧。所以我们就去看了电影，然后我们觉得，哦，这部电影可能并没有完全展现……
[00:18:51.310] Like we learned to where like, oh, it's originally a fanfic. OK, like this movie might not have portrayed what the original fanfic was doing. But yeah, I think there's so many movies out there now that are like sometimes I watch
[00:18:51.310] 就像我们逐渐明白，哦，它原本是同人小说。好吧，这部电影可能并没有完全展现原著同人小说的内容。但是，是的，我觉得现在有很多电影都是这样，有时候我会看……
[00:19:03.270] the trailer and I'm like, oh, this looks like it might have been a fanfic. Yeah. And it's like you can also, I don't know, it's a specific genre of movies where it's like the acting isn't quite there. And it's just like something about the way it's filmed.
[00:19:03.270] 看了预告片，我就想，哦，这看起来像是同人作品。是啊。而且，我也不知道，这属于某种特定类型的电影，感觉演员的演技不太到位。感觉就是拍摄手法的问题。
[00:19:17.790] You know that this started out as a fanfic, like something is off. I don't know. I guess the ultimate fanfic dream is like, imagine you wrote a fanfic for your celebrity crush and you were able to cast that person eventually in your movie.
[00:19:17.790] 你知道这最初是篇同人小说，感觉有点不对劲。我也不知道。我觉得同人小说创作者的终极梦想大概就是，想象一下你为你迷恋的明星写了一篇同人小说，结果最终你真的让这个人出演了你的电影。
[00:19:31.910] Like that would be crazy, right? That would be amazing. That sounds like a job, like you're a screenwriter and you don't use their name at the beginning and then you just cast them when you're making the movie.
[00:19:31.910] 那简直太疯狂了，对吧？那太棒了。听起来像份工作，就像你是个编剧，一开始不提他们的名字，然后在拍电影的时候再选他们出演。
[00:19:46.430] Oh, my gosh, guys, there is this one episode of iCarly that came out where One Direction was on it. And I started, I started writing a fanfic as if I was like working on iCarly, like on the set. And I was like one of the background people.
[00:19:46.430] 天哪，各位，有一集《爱卡莉》播出的时候，单向乐队客串了一把。然后我就开始写同人小说，假装自己也在《爱卡莉》剧组工作，就像在片场一样。我扮演的是一个群众演员。
[00:20:06.830] Oh, my God. Yeah. And then they like, Harry, like saw me and came up to me and started talking to me. And like while we were filming, we really hit it off. Like I didn't finish it, but like I was literally, I literally wrote it down.
[00:20:06.830] 我的天哪。是啊。然后他们，比如哈利，看到我，就走过来跟我说话。我们拍戏的时候，真的聊得很投机。我当时没写完，但我真的，真的把它写下来了。
[00:20:22.830] I don't know. I didn't like have a laptop or something then. So I wrote it down in my diary, like the fanfic in different chapters. It was insane. This is amazing. This is how writers are born. Yeah, maybe I should get it published.
[00:20:22.830] 我不知道。那时候我好像没有笔记本电脑之类的东西。所以我就把它写在日记里，就像写同人小说一样，分成不同的章节。真是太疯狂了。这太神奇了。作家就是这样诞生的。嗯，也许我应该把它出版。
[00:20:39.350] I also wrote a fanfic back in the day, actually. Me and my friend co-wrote like a Big Bang fanfic. Oh, my God. And we even published it too. And I don't think we got like a ton of traction or anything.
[00:20:39.350] 其实我以前也写过同人小说。我和朋友合写了一篇《生活大爆炸》的同人小说。我的天哪。我们还把它发表了呢。不过我觉得反响并不好。
[00:20:50.670] But I remember like we were watching the view count go up and we were like, holy shit, this is crazy. You're like people are thirsty for the content. Yeah. And it was perfect because she liked G-Dragon and I liked T.O.P.
[00:20:50.670] 但我记得当时我们看着播放量不断上升，我们都惊呆了，心想，我的天，这也太疯狂了。感觉大家对这种内容非常渴望。是啊。而且这简直太完美了，因为她喜欢G-Dragon，而我喜欢T.O.P。
[00:21:04.710] So, you know, we didn't like have to fight for our mans. Like each had our own. Oh, my God. That's so funny. And I feel like sometimes reading fanfic, you're like, oh, like I could totally do this. We're just writing down a story that's in our head.
[00:21:04.710] 所以，你知道，我们不用为了争夺男人而打架。每个人都有自己的男人。我的天哪。这太搞笑了。我觉得有时候读同人小说，你会想，哦，我完全可以写出这样的故事。我们只是把脑子里的故事写下来而已。
[00:21:19.390] But like sometimes the dedication these writers have is truly amazing. They're writing like novels in there. Yeah. And there used to be one writer that, again, had that Harry Styles fanfic. She used to come out with a new chapter every week or something.
[00:21:19.390] 但有时候，这些作者的投入程度真的令人惊叹。他们简直是在写小说。是啊。以前有个作者，她写过哈里·斯泰尔斯的同人小说。她以前几乎每周都更新一章。
[00:21:34.750] So my friend and I would like wait for the link. And like, you know, sometimes obviously her life got busy. So she didn't post. And I was just so sad when those chapters didn't come out. Like I was my lifeline was on those chapters.
[00:21:34.750] 所以我和朋友就等着她发链接。你知道，有时候她生活很忙，所以就没更新。那些章节没出来的时候我真的很难过，感觉我的命根子就靠那些章节了。
[00:21:50.790] Dude, those are like webtoons basically. And I feel like really big fanfic writers are like many celebrities in the fandom. So don't judge me, please. But when I was really deep into like the succession obsession of it all, I would read, you know, the fanfics on Tumblr.
[00:21:50.790] 老兄，那些基本上就跟网络漫画差不多。我觉得那些很火的同人小说作者就像圈子里的很多名人一样。所以别评判我，好吗？不过，当初我特别沉迷于《继承之战》那会儿，我就会去Tumblr上看同人小说。
[00:22:11.790] And there's not a ton of people who write like Kendall Roy fanfics. But there's quite a lot actually, maybe like 10 or 15 at least. And they're really good people.
[00:22:11.790] 写肯德尔·罗伊同人小说的作者并不多。但实际上还真不少，至少有十来个吧。而且他们都是很棒的人。
[00:22:20.390] They're like famous and people are like always in their ass like, oh, my God, can you please write, you know, a story about how Kendall does this or like Kendall is in this situation and blah blah.
[00:22:20.390] 她们就像名人一样，人们总是围着她们转，比如，“哦，我的天哪，你能写个故事吗？关于肯达尔做了什么，或者肯达尔遇到了什么情况等等等等。”
[00:22:30.350] And they're like, okay, yeah, like, sorry, I didn't have that much time to write today. But here's like a 10,000 word like, you know, story responding to your ask. And I'm like, these people are busy. They're like booked and busy. You know, they need to be making money. Yeah.
[00:22:30.350] 他们就说，好吧，是啊，抱歉，我今天没那么多时间写。不过这里有一篇大概一万字的故事，算是回应你的要求。我就想，这些人都很忙。他们日程都排满了，忙得不可开交。你知道，他们也需要赚钱。是啊。
[00:22:44.710] Wait, I did not know that they had fanfics like that today. For some reason, fanfics in my head live when I was in like high school, probably because that's when I was most obsessed with it. So I'm actually really surprised to hear about like Kendall Roy fanfics.
[00:22:44.710] 等等，我不知道现在还有这种同人小说。不知为何，我脑海里的同人小说总是停留在我高中时代，可能是因为那时候我最痴迷于此吧。所以，听说有肯德尔·罗伊的同人小说，我真的非常惊讶。
[00:23:01.070] That's crazy. Oh, my gosh. I think nowadays, okay, of course, One Direction fanfic is like legendary, right? There's like so much and it's like so dense. I think there's maybe not anything that has reached that kind of level of hugeness.
[00:23:01.070] 太疯狂了。我的天哪。我觉得现在，好吧，当然，One Direction的同人小说简直是传奇，对吧？数量多得惊人，而且内容非常丰富。我觉得可能没有其他任何东西能达到这种规模了。
[00:23:18.830] But now it's just like more spread out among things. Some of the fanfic I do really like is related to shows because sometimes it's like, oh, the show didn't end. So, you know, someone writes up like what they think is going to happen next.
[00:23:18.830] 但现在这种现象更加分散了。我真正喜欢的一些同人作品是和电视剧相关的，因为有时候会觉得，哎，剧还没完结呢。所以，你知道，就会有人写一些他们认为接下来会发生什么的故事。
[00:23:31.510] And I feel like those are super enticing. But yeah, I think like there hasn't been as much of a like huge craze for I guess like fanfic of real people as there was during One Direction time. I could be wrong, but that's what it feels like.
[00:23:31.510] 我觉得这些都超级吸引人。不过，我觉得现在像One Direction时期那样，真人同人小说的热潮好像没有以前那么大了。我可能说错了，但感觉就是这样。
[00:23:45.230] But you know what I see now? I see like fan edit videos. Oh, yeah. On YouTube or even like Instagram reels where it's just like maybe that's more around like shipping like two characters, not necessarily like fangirling over a certain character or actor.
[00:23:45.230] 但你知道我现在看到的是什么吗？我看到的是粉丝剪辑视频。哦，对。在YouTube上，甚至在Instagram Reels上，那些视频可能更多的是关于两个角色的CP配对，而不是对某个特定角色或演员的狂热追捧。
[00:24:01.710] Actually, no, I see it for actors too. Like there's this one actor that I'm obsessed with. He's a Bollywood actor. His name is Aditya Roy Kapoor. Very, very, very attractive man.
[00:24:01.710] 其实，不，我觉得演员也有这种现象。比如，我特别迷恋一个演员，他是宝莱坞演员，名叫阿迪亚·罗伊·卡普尔，非常非常非常有魅力。
[00:24:12.870] And on my Instagram reel, sometimes I'll see like edits of him like walking or like in interviews and I'm like obsessed. And my friends and I just send it to each other. What a beautiful man. So it still exists, I guess, just like in different forms.
[00:24:12.870] 在我的Instagram Reels上，我有时会看到一些他的剪辑片段，比如走路的片段或者采访片段，我简直着迷了。我和朋友们会互相转发。他真是个帅哥。所以，我想，这份喜爱依然存在，只是以不同的形式呈现了。
[00:24:28.350] You know, back to the question of like, do you think you have to be in a specific like mindset to feel a really fangirl over someone?
[00:24:28.350] 你知道，回到最初的问题，你认为你必须处于某种特定的心态才能真正对某人产生迷恋吗？
[00:24:35.270] I feel like to like be super obsessed with someone, you need to have the time because as we're talking about this, I'm like, oh, yeah, there's so much content.
[00:24:35.270] 我觉得要非常迷恋一个人，你需要有时间，因为当我们谈论这个话题时，我就想，哦，是的，内容太多了。
[00:24:43.590] Honestly, if someone's a celebrity or has like some level of fame, there's usually a pile of content that you know they're in, whether it's like movies, interviews, etc., etc.
[00:24:43.590] 说实话，如果某人是名人或者有一定的知名度，通常会有很多他们参与的内容，比如电影、采访等等。
[00:24:54.550] So I feel like one of the things is you have the time or maybe you're making the time like it's it's the distraction for you from like real life. True. You have to be able to like absorb the content.
[00:24:54.550] 所以我觉得其中一个原因是，你有没有时间，或者你挤出时间来做这件事，它能让你暂时摆脱现实生活。没错。你必须能够吸收这些内容。
[00:25:08.630] Yeah. And I also think like even, for example, like reading the fanfics, I mean, I guess it could be like an alternate to reading a book because it's just like a story.
[00:25:08.630] 是的。而且我觉得，比如说，读同人小说，我觉得它也可以算是读一本书的替代品，因为它就像一个故事。
[00:25:18.150] I think I needed to just like be in the mindset of having the time to obsess over somebody because then I would like go into a deep dive and like literally watch every single video, every single interview or like, yeah, it's a full time job.
[00:25:18.150] 我觉得我需要让自己有时间去痴迷于某个人，因为那样我就会深入研究，真的会看完每一个视频、每一次采访，嗯，这简直就是一份全职工作。
[00:25:32.710] Yeah, it really is like you truly do become obsessed. Like everything that you're thinking about is like, oh, what's the next show or like fanfic or like interview that I can watch?
[00:25:32.710] 是啊，真的会让人完全沉迷。你满脑子想的都是，哦，接下来该看什么剧、同人小说或者采访呢？
[00:25:42.750] And I feel like it also becomes so all consuming because like you said, you're constantly thinking about it. So then I feel like even in conversations, I'm like, oh, my God, like this is so something. True. Do you think celebrities like know about all these fanfics?
[00:25:42.750] 我觉得它还会让人完全沉迷其中，就像你说的，你会一直想着它。所以我觉得即使在聊天的时候，我也会想，我的天哪，这真是太不可思议了。确实如此。你觉得像明星这样的人会知道这些同人小说吗？
[00:26:01.110] Yes. I think because of the One Direction thing, they were made aware like it got so big, like people would ask them an interview sometime. Oh, yeah, that's true. That's just so crazy. Like imagine you're just living your life and people are writing stories about you. Crazy stories.
[00:26:01.110] 是的。我觉得是因为单向组合那件事，他们才意识到这件事闹得这么大，有时候甚至会有人找他们采访。哦，对，确实如此。这太疯狂了。想象一下，你只是过着自己的生活，却有人在写关于你的故事。一些疯狂的故事。
[00:26:20.110] That's true. Some some of them do get kind of crazy. Dude, so Jeremy Strong's first acting thing after Succession ended was like this Broadway show. Right. And that came out when I was like peak obsession. So I bought tickets to his opening night of previews.
[00:26:20.110] 没错。有些人确实有点疯狂。哥们儿，杰瑞米·斯特朗在《继承之战》结束后第一个演的角色就是百老汇的一部戏。对。那部戏上演的时候，我正处于对他的狂热时期。所以我买了首演预演的票。
[00:26:37.070] James and I went to go watch him. And James is very like made it very clear that he did not want to be there. But I was like, OK, I need like moral support.
[00:26:37.070] 我和詹姆斯去看他。詹姆斯很明确地表示他不想去。但我当时想，好吧，我需要精神上的支持。
[00:26:44.910] You know, I even thought about like bringing my GQ magazine to like get it signed by him because usually like the Broadway actors will come out and like sign stuff. I totally forgot. But regardless, we like made it there to opening night.
[00:26:44.910] 你知道吗，我甚至想过带我的《GQ》杂志去让他签名，因为百老汇的演员们通常会出来签名。我完全忘了这事儿。不过不管怎样，我们还是赶上了首演之夜。
[00:26:57.150] And I had just read so many fanfics, many of them like raunchy to I guess use like the term about this guy. And if I'm able to read this stuff, it means someone is out there writing it.
[00:26:57.150] 我之前读过好多关于这个角色的同人小说，其中很多都相当露骨，用“露骨”这个词来形容比较贴切。如果我能读到这些东西，那就说明有人在写。
[00:27:10.350] Right. So when we were standing outside, like waiting for him to come out and like sign our shit, just looking around the crowd. Like, are you the one who wrote this fanfic? You know, like I was just like what was going through my head.
[00:27:10.350] 对。所以我们当时站在外面，等着他出来给我们签名，一边环顾四周。我就在想，你就是写这篇同人小说的那个人吗？你知道，我当时脑子里全是这些想法。
[00:27:21.670] Like, are you the fanfic writer that wrote this story? Oh my god. I'm so curious about those fanfics actually, because I just I just can't get around somebody writing a fanfic about Kendall Roy. I just, that's just really cracking me up. Jisoo, you should link me.
[00:27:21.670] 你是写这篇同人小说的作者吗？我的天哪。我真的对那些同人小说很好奇，因为我实在无法接受有人写关于肯德尔·罗伊的同人小说。这真的太搞笑了。智秀，你应该把链接发给我。
[00:27:43.190] I want to read them. Oh my god, maybe I will. I have some bangers. I mean, to be fair, I feel like the Internet is so expansive. So if it exists and it's like published, I feel like there's like a fanfic for it. You know?
[00:27:43.190] 我想读读它们。天哪，也许我会读。我这儿有几本很棒的书。我的意思是，说实话，我觉得互联网太浩瀚了。所以只要是存在且出版过的作品，我觉得肯定就有相关的同人小说。你懂的？
[00:27:57.510] That's true. We have someone right here among us who is a big Kendall Roy fan. So there must be many more out there. It's like semi embarrassing. I feel like also, though, like it's fun to be obsessed during the peak of something.
[00:27:57.510] 没错。我们这儿就有一位肯德尔·罗伊的铁杆粉丝。所以肯定还有很多人跟她一样。这有点让人不好意思。不过，我觉得在某件事最火的时候痴迷也挺有意思的。
[00:28:15.830] So, you know, for like you and Kendall Roy, it was like the peak time of succession. And I feel like that's such a good time just because there's so much content being put out.
[00:28:15.830] 所以，你知道，像你和肯德尔·罗伊那样的人，那段时间就像是事业的巅峰时期。我觉得那段时期真的很好，因为有很多内容被推出来。
[00:28:26.110] Like you said, Tania, like when you started getting obsessed with One Direction, they were just like force feeding everyone their content. But you were like, oh, yeah, I love this. Yeah, I did not mind at all.
[00:28:26.110] 就像你说的，塔尼亚，就像你刚开始迷上单向组合的时候，他们就像在强迫所有人接受他们的内容。但你当时就觉得，哦，是啊，我喜欢这个。是啊，我一点也不介意。
[00:28:37.670] Yeah. And I feel like that is probably such a good wave to ride because you're like, oh, my God, the content is never ending right now. But then when things start to like die down, it's like it's kind of depressing.
[00:28:37.670] 是啊。我觉得这可能是个很棒的时期，因为你会觉得，天哪，现在的内容简直无穷无尽。但当热度开始下降的时候，就会有点令人沮丧。
[00:28:49.350] You're like, oh, OK, I guess like I'll move on now. Oh, yeah, that's pretty sad if you put it like that, like moving on from your obsession. Yeah. Like you put it on hold. You're like, OK, I'll go do other things with my life. On to the next.
[00:28:49.350] 你会想，哦，好吧，我想我该放下这件事了。哦，是啊，这么说其实挺悲哀的，就像放下你的执念一样。是啊。就像你把它搁置了。你会想，好吧，我去做其他事了。开始新的生活。
[00:29:09.110] Actually, yeah, my friend and I were talking about that the other day. She's like, I started reading the Harry Styles fanfic again because she just wanted to feel that like the way that she felt when she was reading those fanfics back in the day.
[00:29:09.110] 其实，是的，我朋友前几天也聊到这个。她说，她又开始看哈里·斯泰尔斯的同人小说了，因为她只是想找回当年看这些同人小说时的感觉。
[00:29:23.510] The excitement of like having more content to consume. Yeah, that's actually kind of interesting to me, Tanaya, because I feel like multiple times throughout this episode you mentioned sending like fanfic links to each other or kind of like sharing your obsession with the people around you.
[00:29:23.510] 那种有更多内容可以消费的兴奋感。嗯，塔娜雅，这确实挺有意思的，因为我觉得你在这一集里好几次提到互相分享同人小说链接，或者说跟身边的人分享你对某件事的痴迷。
[00:29:41.030] So to you, do you think that's like a very integral part of what makes an obsession fun? I think so, because it's just like sharing that with somebody. For example, actually, back in high school, I used to be obsessed with British YouTubers, Zoella, Alfie, you know, that group.
[00:29:41.030] 所以你觉得这是让痴迷变得有趣的重要组成部分吗？我觉得是，因为这就像是和别人分享一样。比如说，其实我高中时就特别迷英国的YouTube博主，比如Zoella、Alfie，你知道的，就是那几个。
[00:29:58.270] Yeah. And I used to kind of just like watch them on my own, you know, whatever, whenever I used to come back from school, just watch some YouTube.
[00:29:58.270] 是啊。我以前经常自己看，你知道，不管怎样，放学回家后就看看YouTube。
[00:30:05.870] And then one time I was like sitting with my friend and I was just like, have you heard about this person named Zoella? And she's like, I love her videos. And I was like, oh, my God, this is so exciting.
[00:30:05.870] 有一次我和朋友坐在一起，我就问她：“你听说过佐伊拉（Zoella）这个人吗？” 她说：“我超爱她的视频。” 我当时就想：“我的天哪，这太让人兴奋了！”
[00:30:17.350] So both of us were like starting to like fangirl and like talk about these videos. So it just made it more like fun to share that experience with somebody also because you can go a little more diluted with somebody else, I will say.
[00:30:17.350] 所以我们俩都开始像追星族一样，讨论这些视频。这样一来，和别人分享这种体验就更有趣了，因为和别人一起看的时候，情绪可能会稍微淡一些。
[00:30:28.830] So it's just it's exciting to have somebody else to talk about it with. I don't think it's necessary, but I think it's just like it just makes it like an experience in my opinion. True. It's definitely an enhancement. You're like enabling each other.
[00:30:28.830] 所以，能和别人一起讨论这件事真的很令人兴奋。我觉得这并非必要，但我觉得这样会让整个过程更有体验感。没错，这绝对是一种提升。你们就像是在互相鼓励。
[00:30:43.870] Yeah, I feel like when I'm obsessed with someone, I'm like quietly trying to insert them into the conversations or I'll quietly admit to like my closest friends like, oh, I'm really obsessed with this one person right now. So actually, right now I'm super obsessed with Kristen Stewart.
[00:30:43.870] 是啊，我觉得当我迷恋上某个人的时候，我会偷偷地把她/他融入到谈话中，或者我会悄悄地跟最亲密的朋友承认，哦，我现在真的很迷恋这个人。所以，实际上，我现在超级迷恋克里斯汀·斯图尔特。
[00:30:59.750] And I've been telling Jisoo, I was like, dude, I don't know. I'm just like obsessed with her right now. Okay, linking it back to like what we've talked about. She's like more introverted and like quiet and like kind of shy and like a little bit awkward.
[00:30:59.750] 我跟智秀说，我说，老兄，我也不知道怎么回事。我现在简直迷上她了。好吧，回到我们之前聊的话题。她比较内向，安静，有点害羞，还有点笨拙。
[00:31:16.390] And I'm like, dude, these are like qualities that I have. It's like it's very relatable. I think she's underrated. Like people hate on her for Twilight, but she's actually a great actress. So I've been binging her movies lately.
[00:31:16.390] 我当时就想，老兄，这些特质我好像也有。感觉特别有共鸣。我觉得她被低估了。很多人因为《暮光之城》讨厌她，但她其实是个很棒的演员。所以我最近一直在狂刷她的电影。
[00:31:29.790] It's so funny because I feel like we hung out a couple of times like over the last week. Just like one of the conversations each time we've hung out, like the destination is just Kristen Stewart. Yeah, it's so true. I don't know how to explain it.
[00:31:29.790] 太搞笑了，感觉我们过去一周好像一起出去玩了好几次。每次出去玩，话题总会不自觉地提到克里斯汀·斯图尔特。对，真的太对了。我也不知道该怎么解释。
[00:31:43.070] Like it's not like the whole time you're like dying to talk about her. I think just somewhere along the line, we just end up there. And I'm like, oh, we're here again. Dude, sometimes it's like masterful.
[00:31:43.070] 好像你一直都特别想聊她似的。我觉得只是不知不觉中，我们最后就聊到她了。然后我就想，哦，我们又聊到这儿了。老兄，有时候这感觉真是绝了。
[00:31:55.870] I weave and then I'm like, oh my God, this is the perfect time. We can bring it home. Oh, actually, I have a really funny thing that I like about Kristen Stewart. She always has eye bags and I feel like I have eye bags.
[00:31:55.870] 我一边织毛衣一边想，天哪，时机正好，我们可以回家了。哦，对了，我喜欢克里斯汀·斯图尔特的一个很有趣的点是，她总是有眼袋，而我觉得自己也有眼袋。
[00:32:09.630] So I'm like, dude, that's like kind of cool that it's like imperfect, you know, like she always has eye bags. I was like, after I noticed that, I literally told you. So I was like, dude, how come like a lot of celebrities have like eye bags?
[00:32:09.630] 所以我就想，哥们儿，这其实挺酷的，有点不完美，你知道吗，比如她总是有眼袋。我注意到这一点之后，就跟你说过。所以我就想，哥们儿，为什么很多名人都有眼袋呢？
[00:32:22.630] And I was like, dude, I don't know. I guess I've never really noticed that about celebrities. Dude, that conversation was so funny now that I'm thinking about it because Crystal was like, dude, do you think I have eye bags?
[00:32:22.630] 我当时就想，老兄，我不知道。我好像从来没注意到过名人有这种现象。老兄，现在想想那段对话真是太搞笑了，因为克丽丝塔尔当时说，老兄，你觉得我有眼袋吗？
[00:32:32.790] And I was like, oh no, I don't think you have eye bags. She's like, no, actually I do have eye bags and you know who else has eye bags? I was like, okay, I see. Yeah, that was one of my less smooth transitions.
[00:32:32.790] 我当时就说，哦不，我觉得你没有眼袋。她说，不，其实我有眼袋，你知道还有谁有眼袋吗？我说，好吧，我明白了。嗯，那是我不太自然的一次对话。
[00:32:44.790] I was like, oh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, that was one of my less smooth transitions. Is that why you were looking into like Twilight fanfic and the Fifty Shades of Grey?
[00:32:44.790] 我当时就想，哦，我不知道。我不知道。我不知道。我不知道。我不知道。我不知道。是啊，那是我不太顺利的一次转变。所以你才会去看《暮光之城》的同人小说和《五十度灰》吗？
[00:33:00.950] Oh no, I just, that's innate knowledge. Kristen Stewart is a modern obsession for me. But I think Kristen Stewart is just a phase for me right now. Do you guys think you have like a biggest obsession or fangirl era? Maybe one that like transcends time.
[00:33:00.950] 哦不，我只是……那是与生俱来的认知。克里斯汀·斯图尔特是我最近迷恋的对象。不过我觉得她现在只是我迷恋她的一个阶段而已。你们有没有那种特别痴迷的对象或者追星时期？也许是那种可以超越时间的。
[00:33:20.110] It'll go dormant, but I'll come back. I'll have to see how this like Kendall Roy thing plays out. Because, okay, the thing is, if there's not new content, which there isn't going to be of succession because the series has already ended,
[00:33:20.110] 它会暂时沉寂，但我会回来的。我得看看肯德尔·罗伊那件事会如何发展。因为，好吧，关键是，如果没有新的内容，而鉴于这部剧已经完结，肯定不会有续集了，
[00:33:36.110] I feel like it's hard and I do really like Jeremy Strong, but it's different. Like, I feel like at the end of the day, it's like a Kendall Roy obsession. And I also like Jeremy Strong. Oh, I see. It's not the other way around.
[00:33:36.110] 我觉得这很难，我确实很喜欢杰瑞米·斯特朗，但感觉不一样。感觉说到底，这就像是迷恋肯德尔·罗伊一样。我也喜欢杰瑞米·斯特朗。哦，我明白了。不是反过来的。
[00:33:47.110] So we will see if this is a phase or not. I will always have a special place in my heart for Big Bang. Although Big Bang has also had its like fair share of problems recently. So you know what? I'm just not doing well.
[00:33:47.110] 所以，我们拭目以待，看看这是否只是暂时的。我心中永远都会有Big Bang这个乐队。虽然Big Bang最近也遇到了不少问题。所以你知道吗？我最近状态不太好。
[00:33:59.270] Like a year or two. I need something new to focus on. One Direction was definitely the biggest obsession that I had. But honestly, I don't see it coming back because A, the band is like done.
[00:33:59.270] 大概一两年吧。我需要一些新的东西来转移注意力。单向组合绝对是我曾经最痴迷的。但说实话，我觉得它不会再回来了，因为首先，这个乐队已经解散了。
[00:34:12.270] But B, for some reason, I'm not as obsessed with like Harry Styles now. I was just obsessed with him back then. I have no idea why. I think it was also because like, I was younger and he was also like, you know, younger. Maybe it's that.
[00:34:12.270] 但是B，不知为何，我现在不像以前那么迷恋哈里·斯泰尔斯了。我以前可是对他非常着迷。我也不知道为什么。我想可能也因为我当时年纪小，他也比我小吧。也许就是这个原因吧。
[00:34:27.270] But yeah, I don't know now. I'm just like, okay, I like your music. Like, I think it's good, but I'm not like watching every interview or like stalking his Instagram or anything like that. Like you kind of outgrew him. Yeah.
[00:34:27.270] 不过，我现在也不知道了。我就觉得，好吧，我喜欢你的音乐。我觉得挺好的，但我不会像以前那样去看他的每个采访，也不会去关注他的Instagram什么的。感觉你已经超越他了。是啊。
[00:34:39.270] And I think it's it's just kind of sad when you put it like that, but I feel like it's true. That's fair. I think maybe we also mellow out when we're older. Like we do have more responsibilities now and like things that take up our time.
[00:34:39.270] 这么说确实有点令人伤感，但我觉得也确实如此。这很合理。我想我们年纪大了之后可能也会变得更温和一些。毕竟我们现在肩负着更多责任，也有很多事情占据了我们的时间。
[00:34:50.430] So we don't have as much free time as we once did in like, you know, high school, college, junior high, where we had much more time to like really become huge fans or like obsess over groups and or celebrities. I think my biggest obsession is probably Taeyeon.
[00:34:50.430] 所以我们现在不像以前那样有很多空闲时间了，比如高中、大学、初中的时候，那时候我们有很多时间可以真正成为某个组合或明星的铁杆粉丝，或者说痴迷。我觉得我最痴迷的明星大概就是泰妍了。
[00:35:06.430] But it's kind of cool because like these people are getting older with us. So as she gets older, she's like more mellowed out. She's like, I don't want to be as busy and like do as many public appearances as before.
[00:35:06.430] 但这也挺酷的，因为这些人跟我们一起慢慢变老。所以随着她年纪渐长，她也变得更加沉稳了。她会说，我不想再像以前那样忙碌，也不想再频繁地出现在公众场合了。
[00:35:21.590] And I think that helps, you know, like mellow everything else out too. It's like, oh, that's perfect. That fits for me too, because I don't have time to like dig through all your interviews and like, you know, binge watch these all for hours on end.
[00:35:21.590] 我觉得这样很有帮助，你知道，也能让其他一切都变得平和一些。感觉就像，哦，这太完美了。这也很适合我，因为我没时间去仔细研究你所有的采访，也没时间一口气看好几个小时。
[00:35:33.590] I'm also an adult now and I have like other things to do, sadly. It's just so funny that you're talking about being an adult because Jisoo literally had her Kendall face as an adult.
[00:35:33.590] 我现在也是个成年人了，很遗憾，我还有其他事情要做。你说到成年这件事真是太搞笑了，因为Jisoo成年后居然还长着一张Kendall的脸。
[00:35:44.750] Like nobody has time to do this Jisoo on the side, like googling all these fanfics. I'm one of the 15 Tumblr fanfic writers. But do you feel like it's on the same level as it was when you were younger?
[00:35:44.750] 好像没人有时间像Jisoo那样业余时间做这些事，比如上网搜同人小说。我是Tumblr上15个写同人小说的人之一。但你觉得现在的情况和你年轻的时候一样吗？
[00:36:00.750] I mean, I guess I don't have like Kendall Roy posters on the wall. Like my wall in my childhood room used to be like covered in like Big Bang posters and whatnot. So in some ways it's just different.
[00:36:00.750] 我的意思是，我猜我墙上没有像肯德尔·罗伊那样的海报。我小时候房间的墙上贴满了《生活大爆炸》之类的海报。所以从某种程度上来说，这很不一样。
[00:36:12.910] And I also thought it was kind of funny because when I was younger, Big Bang was maybe like early 20s or something. And that was like peak hot to me, you know?
[00:36:12.910] 我觉得这挺搞笑的，因为我年轻的时候，《生活大爆炸》大概是20岁出头吧。那时候我觉得它简直是青春偶像的巅峰时期，你知道吗？
[00:36:21.910] And then I realized now that I'm older, I'm like fangirling over people who are like 40s, like mid 40s or something. And I was like, that's crazy. Like our obsessions also kind of grow older with us, right? Well, mine do.
[00:36:21.910] 然后我意识到，现在我年纪大了，竟然开始迷恋那些四五十岁的人。我就想，这太疯狂了。感觉我们的爱好也会随着年龄增长而改变，对吧？至少我的爱好是这样。
[00:36:37.070] No, I think mine also because now like, for example, Theo James, I don't read any fanfics about him, but I do see a lot of edits and videos. And he's definitely older as well. I think it makes sense that your obsessions kind of mature as you grow older.
[00:36:37.070] 不，我觉得我的情况也是这样，比如现在像西奥·詹姆斯这样的人，我虽然不看他的同人小说，但我确实看了很多剪辑和视频。而且他年纪也确实大了。我觉得随着年龄增长，你的爱好也会随之成熟，这很正常。
[00:36:52.070] It would be a little weird if we were like obsessed with somebody in high school. Oh, you're so right. I think like a lot of the newer generation of celebrities, I'm less invested in. I'm just like, oh, they feel young for some reason. Yeah.
[00:36:52.070] 如果我们高中时就迷恋某个人，那确实有点奇怪。哦，你说得太对了。我觉得像很多新生代明星一样，我对他们没那么上心。我只是觉得，哦，不知为何，他们给人的感觉很年轻。是啊。
[00:37:11.230] Although I do wonder if there's like a cap or like a certain point where they stay maybe at like the 50s or something like that. Because my mom used to really like Keanu Reeves and I saw something on Reddit recently.
[00:37:11.230] 不过我确实在想，是不是有个上限，或者说他们最终会停留在某个特定水平，比如50岁左右。因为我妈妈以前很喜欢基努·里维斯，而且我最近在Reddit上看到了一些相关信息。
[00:37:24.230] I was like, oh, Keanu Reeves is going to do like a Broadway show. And because I know how successful of a fan you can be when you go to a Broadway show. I was like, oh my god, mom, maybe we should go watch him together.
[00:37:24.230] 我当时就想，哦，基努·里维斯要去百老汇演出了。因为我知道去看百老汇演出能让你成为多么成功的粉丝。我就说，天哪，妈妈，也许我们应该一起去看他演出。
[00:37:34.390] Then we can get his signature after. She was like, well, I really liked Matrix Keanu Reeves, but I'm not trying to see Keanu at this age. Oh yeah.
[00:37:34.390] 然后我们就可以拿到他的签名了。她当时说，嗯，我真的很喜欢《黑客帝国》里的基努·里维斯，但我现在不想见他。哦，是啊。
[00:37:45.390] Or like, you know, the person that she really likes is like frozen in time and perfectly documented in like a movie. She's like, I don't really feel the need to go see him. He looks different now. He looks different now.
[00:37:45.390] 或者，你知道，她真正喜欢的那个人就像被时间冻结了一样，完美地记录在一部电影里。她会想，我真的没必要去看他。他现在看起来不一样了。他现在看起来不一样了。
[00:37:57.550] So I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting. Yeah, that makes total sense that sometimes your obsession is just of like this particular period of time, like a character or person or whatever. I guess that's what happened to you Taneo with Harry Styles.
[00:37:57.550] 所以我就想，哦，这挺有意思的。是啊，这完全说得通，有时候你会迷恋某个特定的时期、某个角色、某个人或者其他什么东西。我想塔尼奥，你迷恋哈里·斯泰尔斯的时候就是这种情况吧。
[00:38:11.550] Like now that we're out of that time period, you're kind of just like, okay, like I'm over it. It's so funny, Gigi, that you mentioned how your mom was obsessed with somebody. Because it's interesting to see how like fangirling kind of changes throughout the years.
[00:38:11.550] 现在那段时期过去了，你就会觉得，好吧，我已经释怀了。吉吉，你提到你妈妈曾经迷恋过某个人，这太逗了。因为看着追星这种行为随着时间推移而发生变化，真的很有意思。
[00:38:27.710] My mom, when she was younger, used to be obsessed with this cricketer in India. I forgot his name, but she used to have like notebooks with his picture on them that she would take to school.
[00:38:27.710] 我妈妈年轻的时候特别迷恋一个印度板球运动员。我忘了他的名字，但她以前会带一些笔记本去学校，笔记本上贴着他的照片。
[00:38:38.710] Yeah, because back then, like, you know, sure you can watch the television and watch their games, but there's not that much content. Like we have a plethora of content now, but like, I think for her, it was just like having that notebook was just like enough.
[00:38:38.710] 是啊，因为那时候，你知道，当然你可以看电视看他们的比赛，但内容并不多。现在内容多得是，但我觉得对她来说，有了那本笔记本就足够了。
[00:38:52.870] That is her obsession. Yeah, that's so cute. I think my mom had mentioned something about like going to the like CD store or something when albums would drop and like lining up outside and like trying to get the CDs too.
[00:38:52.870] 那是她的爱好。是啊，真可爱。我记得我妈好像说过，专辑发行的时候她会去唱片店之类的，在外面排队，想买到CD。
[00:39:06.870] And I was like, oh my god, it's like such a different generation. For us, we're waiting for like our favorite fanfic to drop on like AO3 or some shit. Oh my god.
[00:39:06.870] 我当时就想，我的天哪，这简直是截然不同的一代人。我们呢，还在等着自己最喜欢的同人小说在AO3之类的网站上发布呢。我的天哪。
[00:39:16.030] Jeecey, to bring it kind of back to the Broadway show you were watching with James, did you wish that he was more supportive and like wanted him to be involved in your obsession?
[00:39:16.030] Jeecey，让我们回到你和 James 一起看的那场百老汇演出，你是否希望他能更支持你，更愿意参与到你的痴迷中来？
[00:39:26.030] Or were you like, oh, you know what, it's fine. It's just for me. I'm glad you're here, but you don't have to do anything. I think the way that James reacted to my Kendall Roy obsession was probably as good as it gets if I'm being honest.
[00:39:26.030] 或者你会说，哦，你知道吗，没关系。这只是我自己的事。我很高兴你在这里，但你不用做什么。说实话，我觉得詹姆斯对我痴迷肯德尔·罗伊的反应大概已经很好了。
[00:39:37.190] I was really in there for a while into that hole. But, you know, James like rewatched Succession with me. He actually was the one who introduced Succession to me in the first place.
[00:39:37.190] 我当时真的陷在那个泥潭里好一阵子了。不过，你知道吗，詹姆斯陪我重温了一遍《继承之战》。事实上，当初就是他向我推荐这部剧的。
[00:39:48.190] He like reluctantly drove me to Barnes & Noble to buy that GQ magazine. And if I'm being honest, the Broadway show that I took him to was like on his birthday weekend. So he even had to like go to New York with me to watch the show with me.
[00:39:48.190] 他很不情愿地开车送我去巴诺书店买那本《GQ》杂志。说实话，我带他去看的百老汇演出正好是他生日周末。所以他甚至还得陪我去纽约看演出。
[00:40:05.350] So I think he was as supportive as it got. And what's actually really funny is when we were getting signatures from Jeremy Strong after the show, me and James had separated because I wasn't sure if he was going to come around and sign everyone.
[00:40:05.350] 所以我觉得他已经尽力支持我了。其实更搞笑的是，演出结束后我们去找杰里米·斯特朗签名的时候，我和詹姆斯分开了，因为我不确定他会不会过来给每个人都签名。
[00:40:18.350] So we were like, OK, let's try to like divide and conquer and get as close to the fence as we can from like two spots.
[00:40:18.350] 所以我们就想，好吧，让我们分而治之，从两个不同的位置尽可能靠近围栏。
[00:40:24.350] So he came around and like signed my playbill. But when he got to the place that James was at, which was kind of at the end, I think there were a lot less people.
[00:40:24.350] 所以他就过来，在我的节目单上签了名。但当他走到詹姆斯所在的位置时（那已经是演出接近尾声了），我觉得人少了很多。
[00:40:31.510] So James actually got to take a selfie with him and have like a full conversation with him. James told me he was like, oh, congrats on the show. You're awesome. I can totally see you getting a Tony, which he did end up getting a Tony for it.
[00:40:31.510] 所以詹姆斯真的跟他合影了，还跟他聊了很久。詹姆斯告诉我，他当时说：“哦，恭喜你主持这个节目。你太棒了。我觉得你肯定能拿托尼奖。”而他最终也确实凭借这个节目拿到了托尼奖。
[00:40:44.510] So I was just like, you know, James isn't like the true fan here, but he's like the more successful fan. He got a selfie with him. Oh my God.
[00:40:44.510] 所以我就想，你知道，詹姆斯虽然不是那种铁杆粉丝，但他算是比较成功的粉丝了。他居然跟他合影了！我的天哪！
[00:40:53.670] But that's nice that he was like willing to rewatch Obsession with you and kind of live vicariously, I guess, kind of through you at a distance. Yeah, he's like, you can do it, but just know that I'm not like 100 percent happy.
[00:40:53.670] 但很高兴他愿意陪你重温《迷恋》，算是间接地体验你的感受吧。是啊，他说，你可以的，但你要知道我并不是百分百满意。
[00:41:09.830] Yeah, I guess it's like interesting if you are like in a relationship and you have an obsession. As I said, I'm like obsessed with Kristen Stewart lately. So I've like made my boyfriend watch at least five Kristen Stewart movies with me.
[00:41:09.830] 是啊，我觉得如果你在恋爱关系中，又迷恋上某个人，那就挺有意思的。就像我说的，我最近迷上了克里斯汀·斯图尔特。所以我至少拉着我男朋友看了五部她的电影。
[00:41:27.830] And then at one point after we finished one of the movies, I turned around. I was like, sorry, I'm making you watch all these movies starring Kristen Stewart. And he was like, no, it's OK. Like some of these movies are bangers.
[00:41:27.830] 然后有一次，我们看完一部电影后，我转过身说，不好意思，我让你看了这么多克里斯汀·斯图尔特主演的电影。他说，没关系，因为有些电影真的很好看。
[00:41:40.990] I was like, oh my God, yes, her art is coming through. Oh my God. You recruited one other person? You're like, yeah, you're right. You're welcome. He's like, I guess I can see some of the charm that you're talking about. Do you have a favorite movie of hers?
[00:41:40.990] 我当时就想，我的天哪，没错，她的艺术才华展现得淋漓尽致。我的天哪。你又招了一个人？你会说，是啊，你说得对。不客气。他说道，我想我能体会到你说的魅力所在了。你最喜欢她的哪部电影？
[00:41:59.150] Well, this one's not my favorite, but I think it's an underrated movie that she was in. It's called Underwater and it's kind of like this, this like thriller slash horror movie about getting out of this super dangerous situation underwater at the bottom of the ocean.
[00:41:59.150] 嗯，这部电影不是我的最爱，但我认为她参演的这部电影被低估了。它叫《深海异兽》，有点像这种惊悚/恐怖片，讲的是一个人在海底身处极其危险的环境中如何脱险。
[00:42:17.150] Its release wasn't huge, but I feel like people who watched it enjoyed it because it's just like very straightforward. There's no over promising under underrated movie. There's no over promising under under delivering. And there's also no like under delivering and over promising. It does what it wants to.
[00:42:17.150] 这部电影上映时规模不算大，但我感觉看过的人都很喜欢，因为它非常直白。它没有那种夸大其词却被低估的电影，也没有那种夸大其词却令人失望的电影，更没有那种夸大其词却令人失望的电影。它完全按照自己的方式呈现。
[00:42:36.310] Yeah, I feel like Kristen Stewart is actually a really good fan girling celebrity for you because as you mentioned, she's a good actress and she has a lot of content, but it's not like in your face. Yeah, she does a lot of like indie films.
[00:42:36.310] 是啊，我觉得克里斯汀·斯图尔特其实很适合你这种追星族的偶像，因为就像你说的，她演技好，作品也多，但又不会太张扬。对，她拍了很多独立电影。
[00:42:50.470] Dude, I'm like kind of laughing because when I was like at the peak of my obsession, any sort of video streaming platform on my phone or like iPad could open and go to the search and it would just say like Jeremy Strong on it.
[00:42:50.470] 老兄，我都有点想笑了，因为在我最痴迷的时候，我手机或iPad上的任何视频流媒体平台，只要打开搜索，就会出现像杰里米·斯特朗这样的结果。
[00:43:04.470] So there's so many lunches where me and James were like, oh, let's like watch something really quick during lunch. And then we would go on HBO and then he would like search, go to search something. It's like Jeremy Strong. He's like, bro, are you kidding me?
[00:43:04.470] 所以有很多次我和詹姆斯一起吃午饭，我们都会说，哦，不如午休的时候快速看点东西吧。然后我们就会打开HBO，然后他会搜索，搜索点什么。比如杰瑞米·斯特朗。他会说，兄弟，你在开玩笑吗？
[00:43:14.470] I feel like if we opened Crystal's phone right now, like your thing would also be like Kristen Stewart. Dude, like my YouTube homepage, a lot of the recommended is like Kristen Stewart interviews. I just can't believe Jisoo that you're so obsessed with Kendall.
[00:43:14.470] 我觉得如果我们现在打开Crystal的手机，你会发现你的喜好也跟Kristen Stewart很像。老兄，我的YouTube主页上推荐的很多都是Kristen Stewart的采访。Jisoo，我简直不敢相信你这么迷Kendall。
[00:43:35.470] Like I can't, for some reason that's still so hilarious to me. Like I've just never had somebody because, you know, the thing is that like usually when people are obsessed with somebody, you know, a big singer or a big celebrity.
[00:43:35.470] 就像我做不到那样，不知为何，这件事仍然让我觉得很搞笑。就像我从来没有过那样的人，因为你知道，通常情况下，当人们迷恋上某个人时，比如某个大牌歌手或大明星。
[00:43:49.630] But this is just such and Succession was a really popular show. Don't get me wrong, but it's not necessarily a show that has characters that you would fangirl over.
[00:43:49.630] 但事实就是如此，《继承之战》确实是一部非常受欢迎的剧集。别误会我的意思，但这部剧里的角色未必会让你疯狂追捧。
[00:43:58.630] So it's just like the fact, I don't know, the fact that it's Kendall Roy is just really getting to me. It's just so funny. I see you like intermittently laughing, like cracking up throughout the episode. Like, oh my God, Kendall Roy.
[00:43:58.630] 所以，我也不知道，就是因为是肯德尔·罗伊这件事，真的让我很受触动。太搞笑了。我看到你时不时地笑，在整集节目里都笑个不停。我的天哪，肯德尔·罗伊。
[00:44:11.790] Every time you mentioned his name, I'm like Kendall Roy. It's so random. I feel like it's also worse too for the people who have actually seen Succession. Exactly, because there's literally like parts in the show where he's like shitting in his own pants.
[00:44:11.790] 每次你提到他的名字，我就感觉自己像肯德尔·罗伊一样。真是莫名其妙。我觉得看过《继承之战》的人更是如此。没错，因为剧里有好几段他都吓得尿裤子了。
[00:44:28.790] And I'm like, how are you obsessed with this man? And Jisoo's like, yes. I'm like slay king. It's unexplainable. Truly, truly. We do often like to say Jisoo has a unique taste. Is there anybody else that you've been obsessed with that's been weird?
[00:44:28.790] 我就问她，你怎么会这么迷恋这个人？Jisoo 说，是啊，我简直把他迷得神魂颠倒。真的，没法解释。我们经常说 Jisoo 的品味很独特。你有没有迷恋过其他什么人，感觉很奇怪？
[00:44:48.950] Not weird, but out of the norm. I mean, I guess I had like a mini Nicolas Cage thing, but it wasn't like, you know, I wasn't like, oh, he's so hot. I was just like, this guy is like a legend.
[00:44:48.950] 不算奇怪，但确实有点不寻常。我的意思是，我当时可能有点像迷恋尼古拉斯·凯奇那样，但不是那种，你知道，我不是那种觉得“哦，他好帅”的感觉。我只是觉得，这家伙简直是个传奇。
[00:45:00.950] And then I was like into Anthony Davis and I was like, oh, he's so hot. And then I was like into Anthony Davis for a while. Okay, you know what? It's just not a good track record for me.
[00:45:00.950] 然后我就迷上了安东尼·戴维斯，觉得他太帅了。然后我就迷了他一段时间。好吧，你知道吗？这对我来说可不是什么好兆头。
[00:45:13.110] James is always like, oh my God, like these men that Jisoo really like, what does that say about me? He's always like, Jisoo has the worst taste in men. Jisoo's like, I married you. Yeah. I got one right.
[00:45:13.110] James总是说：“我的天哪，Jisoo喜欢的那些男人，这说明我品味不好吗？”他总是说：“Jisoo的择偶眼光太差了。”Jisoo就会说：“我嫁给你了。是啊，我至少找对了一个。”
[00:45:31.270] I think most people probably go through some sort of quote unquote obsessing or just like really get into like fan culture. And I thought it was really fun for us to talk through what captures our interest and how our fangirling has evolved over the years.
[00:45:31.270] 我觉得大多数人可能都会经历某种程度的“痴迷”，或者说非常投入到粉丝文化中。我觉得我们一起聊聊自己感兴趣的事物，以及这些年来我们的追星行为是如何演变的，真的很有意思。
