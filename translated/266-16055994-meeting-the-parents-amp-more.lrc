[00:00:00.000] Hi! Welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. Today we have a couple of Gen Z words, actually. One I think is funny and relatively self-explanatory, and the other one, I think it took me a little longer to grasp what it was, but I've heard it enough now to kind of get it to the point where I could almost reason it out loud.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨！欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo，我是Crystal。今天我们来聊聊两个Z世代的词汇。其中一个我觉得很有趣，也比较容易理解；另一个词我一开始理解得比较慢，不过现在听多了，也差不多能把它解释清楚了。
[00:00:38.000] So the two phrases we have today are type shit and ah. It sounds so stupid to say them on their own, but ah is literally like A-H-H and type shit, it can be said as like type shit or kind of trailing off like type shit.
[00:00:38.000] 今天我们要学的两个短语是“type shit”和“ah”。单独说起来很傻，但“ah”的发音就像“A-H-H”，而“type shit”可以像“type shit”那样说，也可以像“type shit”那样慢慢地说。
[00:00:57.920] I feel like these words make way more sense too when you kind of see them typed out.
[00:00:57.920] 我觉得这些话打出来之后更容易理解。
[00:01:02.740] Mm-hmm. Um, but like you said, I feel like saying it out loud sometimes feels so unnatural unless you like force the slang accent a little bit.
[00:01:02.740] 嗯。但是就像你说的，我觉得有时候大声说出来感觉很不自然，除非你刻意模仿俚语口音。
[00:01:12.100] Yeah. Ah is pretty funny because it's like a direct replacement for ass. This can be used in so many different ways. So remember one of our first slang words was deadass?
[00:01:12.100] 是啊。“啊”这个词挺搞笑的，因为它就像是“屁股”的直接替代品。它的用法非常多。还记得我们最早学的俚语之一就是“deadass”吗？
[00:01:25.480] Right. You could low-key be like deadass. Damn, I don't know about that one.
[00:01:25.480] 没错。你可能表面上装作很认真的样子。哎，我真不知道该怎么说。
[00:01:33.940] I feel like the really common one that I see a lot is when someone is describing someone else as goofy. They're like, oh, this is one goofy-ah bitch or like goofy-ah guy.
[00:01:33.940] 我觉得最常见的情况是，当有人形容另一个人很傻的时候。他们会说，哦，这家伙真是个傻瓜，或者是个傻瓜。
[00:01:43.860] Yeah, I think it might originate from the culture on TikTok where certain words are censored to get around the censorship. I think you can't say kill on TikTok so people get around it by saying something like unalive.
[00:01:43.860] 是的，我觉得这可能源于TikTok上的文化，那里某些词语会被屏蔽，所以人们会用一些变通的词语来规避审查。比如，TikTok上不能说“kill”（杀），所以人们就用“unalive”（不活着）之类的词来代替。
[00:01:58.860] And so ah, I think is a result of that too. Not that ass itself is censored on TikTok that I personally know of, but it's just maybe like a funny way to get around this potential bad word.
[00:01:58.860] 所以，我觉得这也是原因之一。就我个人所知，TikTok 上并没有屏蔽“ass”这个词本身，但这可能只是一种巧妙地规避这个潜在脏话的方式。
[00:02:13.720] And then it has turned into a slang word.
[00:02:13.720] 然后它就变成了一个俚语。
[00:02:16.340] Oh, I like that theory. I think my theory was a little bit different. I was wondering if there is like a specific region of the US where maybe they don't pronounce like the back consonant of a word and they kind of trail off like that.
[00:02:16.340] 哦，我喜欢这个理论。我觉得我的理论有点不一样。我当时在想，美国是不是有某个特定地区的人发音时，单词的后辅音可能不太明显，发音会有点拖沓。
[00:02:29.980] So then sometimes when slang gets popular, I feel like the region dialect also gets popular in a sense. So maybe it could have something to do with that too.
[00:02:29.980] 所以有时候俚语流行起来的时候，我觉得某种地方方言也会随之流行起来。所以这或许也跟这个有关。
[00:02:40.440] That could be true. The only thing about this is I've never heard people actually say this one in person. It's always typed out, right? A-H-H.
[00:02:40.440] 这或许是真的。只是我从没听人当面说过这句话。它总是以文字形式出现，对吧？啊-啊-啊。
[00:02:49.660] Yeah, I think I've seen people use it, but it's always young people. So I can never imagine people like our age using it.
[00:02:49.660] 是的，我好像见过有人用，但都是年轻人。所以我实在无法想象我们这个年纪的人会用。
[00:02:55.540] Yeah, for sure.
[00:02:55.540] 是的，当然。
[00:02:55.920] It's always like teenagers in a mall getting interviewed by some dude.
[00:02:55.920] 感觉就像一群青少年在商场里被某个男人采访一样。
[00:02:58.820] Oh my god. Yeah, I would feel too unnatural saying ah.
[00:02:58.820] 我的天哪。是啊，我觉得说“啊”会很不自然。
[00:03:01.780] Ah.
[00:03:01.780] 啊。
[00:03:05.820] So our other word is type shit. We coupled this one with A-H-H because it's similar where it kind of trails off at the end. It's like type shit, like S-H-I-I.
[00:03:05.820] 所以我们的另一个词是“type shit”。我们把它和 A-H-H 搭配在一起，因为它们的发音很相似，都是以渐弱结尾。就像“type shit”一样，就像 S-H-I-I。
[00:03:17.820] But it's a little more confusing because the meaning behind it is more like I agree or I feel you.
[00:03:17.820] 但这有点令人困惑，因为它的含义更像是“我同意”或“我懂你的感受”。
[00:03:23.820] Yeah, I feel like an example of that usage of type shit could be like someone saying, oh, I really love to listen to Travis Scott.
[00:03:23.820] 是的，我觉得这种“垃圾”用法的一个例子就像有人说，哦，我真的很喜欢听 Travis Scott 的歌。
[00:03:32.300] I don't know, just some random rapper people like to listen to. And then the other person in the conversation would be like type shit, type shit.
[00:03:32.300] 我不知道，就是一些大家喜欢听的随机说唱歌手。然后对话中的另一个人就会说“胡扯，胡扯”。
[00:03:39.280] To be like, yeah, I also like to listen to it.
[00:03:39.280] 就像，是啊，我也喜欢听。
[00:03:41.120] Yes.
[00:03:41.120] 是的。
[00:03:41.400] But I feel like it's so unintuitive because type shit to me is kind of a way to describe something and not necessarily a verbal yes or no.
[00:03:41.400] 但我感觉这很不直观，因为对我来说，文字描述是一种描述事物的方式，并不一定是口头上的“是”或“否”。
[00:03:50.680] Right.
[00:03:50.680] 正确的。
[00:03:50.820] So I think the original usage or like the more intuitive usage of this word could be this rapper released this new album and it's a vibey type shit or something, you know, like that.
[00:03:50.820] 所以我觉得这个词最初的用法，或者说更直观的用法，可能是这个说唱歌手发行了一张新专辑，感觉很嗨之类的，你知道，就是那种感觉。
[00:04:03.560] Yeah, that's all so fucking stupid.
[00:04:03.560] 是啊，这一切都太他妈愚蠢了。
[00:04:05.800] But basically, I feel like that should be how it is used.
[00:04:05.800] 但我觉得基本上就应该这样使用。
[00:04:09.820] But the way the new generation uses it is just they use it to mean totally or like kinda or something.
[00:04:09.820] 但新一代人使用这个词的方式，只是用来表示“完全”或“有点像”之类的意思。
[00:04:16.540] So I don't know. It's just weird.
[00:04:16.540] 我也不知道。真是奇怪。
[00:04:17.620] Dude, I think I've like brainwashed myself into understanding it because I do hear people say it more often lately.
[00:04:17.620] 老兄，我觉得我好像被洗脑了，所以才这么理解它，因为我最近确实经常听到人们这么说。
[00:04:25.060] Sometimes when they say it, I'm like, oh, I kind of get it.
[00:04:25.060] 有时他们这么说的时候，我会想，哦，我有点明白了。
[00:04:29.720] I guess the roundabout way is let's go based off your original example.
[00:04:29.720] 我想最迂回的办法就是，让我们以你最初的例子为基础来探讨。
[00:04:35.160] Like, oh, I like Travis Scott.
[00:04:35.160] 比如，哦，我喜欢特拉维斯·斯科特。
[00:04:36.900] Yeah, type shit, type shit.
[00:04:36.900] 对，打些乱七八糟的东西，打些乱七八糟的东西。
[00:04:38.200] So they're kind of saying like, I like that type of shit too.
[00:04:38.200] 所以他们其实是在说，我也喜欢那种东西。
[00:04:41.000] Hmm.
[00:04:41.000] 唔。
[00:04:44.120] That is true.
[00:04:44.120] 没错。
[00:04:45.780] But it's just like, are we really extending language this far?
[00:04:45.780] 但这就像是，我们真的要把语言延伸到这种程度吗？
[00:04:51.240] But I know with this one, there is a specific song that's associated with it.
[00:04:51.240] 但我知道，这个视频有一首特定的歌曲与之相关。
[00:04:56.660] So I actually don't think the song is like the originator of the slang, but I think it just capitalizes off of how popular type shit is.
[00:04:56.660] 所以我其实并不认为这首歌是这种俚语的起源，而只是利用了这种俚语的流行。
[00:05:04.460] This one specifically is like a future Travis Scott, Metro Boomin, Playboy Cardi song.
[00:05:04.460] 这首歌感觉像是Travis Scott、Metro Boomin和Playboy Cardi未来会合作的歌曲。
[00:05:11.240] And when that song released, that's when I started really seeing type shit on social media.
[00:05:11.240] 那首歌发行后，我才开始真正看到社交媒体上充斥着各种各样的垃圾信息。
[00:05:15.800] But it's honestly so funny when you Google this phrase because the results that come up are just like, what does it mean when a boy says type shit in text?
[00:05:15.800] 但说实话，当你用谷歌搜索这个短语时，你会发现结果非常搞笑，比如，“当一个男孩说‘在短信里输入垃圾’是什么意思？”
[00:05:25.760] Oh my God.
[00:05:25.760] 我的天啊。
[00:05:26.640] I saw one that was like a link to a TikTok video that said, how do you use type shit correctly?
[00:05:26.640] 我看到一个链接，指向一个 TikTok 视频，视频内容是：如何正确使用 type shit？
[00:05:33.280] Yeah, there's also like a summary that says it could mean kinda, but also could mean totally and could also be vibes.
[00:05:33.280] 是的，还有个总结说，它可能意味着“有点像”，也可能意味着“完全”，也可能是一种感觉。
[00:05:41.080] Oh my God.
[00:05:41.080] 我的天啊。
[00:05:41.620] It's a lot of things.
[00:05:41.620] 它包含很多方面。
[00:05:43.500] It's universal at this point.
[00:05:43.500] 这一点现在已是普遍现象。
[00:05:45.340] Yeah, it basically just means everything.
[00:05:45.340] 是的，它基本上意味着一切。
[00:05:47.800] Well, moving on from our slang words that continue to confuse us, unfortunately.
[00:05:47.800] 好吧，我们还是先别谈那些让我们感到困惑的俚语了，很遗憾。
[00:05:53.840] Type shit, type shit.
[00:05:53.840] 胡说八道，胡说八道。
[00:05:56.260] Today we wanted to talk about parents within a relationship context.
[00:05:56.260] 今天我们想谈谈父母在两性关系中的角色。
[00:06:02.580] How they factor in and how we deal with their presence or non-presence in relationship involvement.
[00:06:02.580] 它们如何影响人际关系，以及我们如何应对它们在人际关系中的存在或缺失。
[00:06:12.760] Yeah, I feel like as much as a relationship is a very romantic and intimate thing that happens between two people, it's hard to ignore the impact that family can have on a relationship.
[00:06:12.760] 是的，我觉得虽然恋爱关系是两个人之间非常浪漫和亲密的事情，但很难忽视家庭对恋爱关系的影响。
[00:06:24.920] And it can be something so innocent like, oh, hopefully I can impress my SO's parents.
[00:06:24.920] 而且可能是一些非常无辜的想法，比如，哦，希望我能给伴侣的父母留下好印象。
[00:06:31.580] Or it could be something way more complex and nuanced that you might have to work around a little bit.
[00:06:31.580] 或者，它可能是一些更复杂、更微妙的事情，你可能需要想办法解决。
[00:06:37.520] So I am pretty interested to dive into this topic.
[00:06:37.520] 所以我很有兴趣深入研究这个话题。
[00:06:40.540] But I want to kick this off by starting with something that I feel like is commonly said, which is that choosing a partner can mean choosing their family as well.
[00:06:40.540] 但我想先从一句常被提及的话开始，那就是选择伴侣也可能意味着选择他们的家庭。
[00:06:50.160] So what do you think about this concept?
[00:06:50.160] 你对这个概念有什么看法？
[00:06:52.460] Like, do you think this rings pretty true?
[00:06:52.460] 你觉得这说法挺有道理的吗？
[00:06:54.260] Honestly, I feel like it does ring true, especially for me, because I think my values prioritize family a lot.
[00:06:54.260] 说实话，我觉得这话很有道理，尤其对我来说，因为我认为我的价值观非常重视家庭。
[00:07:03.440] Family members and connection with family.
[00:07:03.440] 家庭成员及与家人的关系。
[00:07:06.200] So that translates to when I look for a partner, I kind of expect that we'll be, you know, hanging out with the parents a lot, building that relationship, having a good connection with both sides of the family.
[00:07:06.200] 所以，当我寻找伴侣时，我希望我们能经常和双方父母相处，建立关系，与双方家庭都保持良好的联系。
[00:07:18.800] Yeah, I think I feel similarly too.
[00:07:18.800] 是的，我也觉得差不多。
[00:07:21.000] I think in the past as well as now, one of my priorities is frequency of seeing family and how often we can spend long days with them and whatnot.
[00:07:21.000] 我认为过去和现在，我的首要任务之一就是与家人见面的频率，以及我们能和他们一起度过多少天等等。
[00:07:31.420] So that is definitely big for me too.
[00:07:31.420] 所以这对我来说也绝对是一件大事。
[00:07:33.660] I will say it's kind of funny because when you get to that stage of a relationship where you really start to build that relationship with the parents, like you said, there's an element of it that takes me back a little bit to when I was young, even though we're like full-fledged adults now.
[00:07:33.660] 我觉得这有点滑稽，因为当你和父母的关系发展到真正开始建立关系的阶段时，就像你说的，其中有些因素会让我回想起我年轻的时候，即使我们现在都已经是完全成熟的成年人了。
[00:07:48.420] But it kind of reminds me of when you're young and you go to like your friend's house or like your family friend's house or something, and you learn a lot about how that family operates and how their parents are and what that family's rules are.
[00:07:48.420] 但这让我想起小时候去朋友家或者朋友家之类的地方，你会了解到很多关于那个家庭的运作方式、他们的父母是什么样的人以及那个家庭的规矩。
[00:08:01.280] I feel like in a sense, it's a similar thing too when you start to meet your SO's family.
[00:08:01.280] 我觉得从某种意义上说，当你开始见伴侣的家人时，情况也类似。
[00:08:06.500] That's true because like no family is going to be exactly the same.
[00:08:06.500] 确实如此，因为没有哪个家庭会完全相同。
[00:08:10.320] So there's definitely some new perspective and eye-opening that happens there.
[00:08:10.320] 所以，那里肯定会产生一些新的视角和令人大开眼界的体验。
[00:08:16.080] Like, oh, I see this family operates this way and that differs from my family.
[00:08:16.080] 比如，哦，我发现这个家庭是这样运作的，这和我的家庭不一样。
[00:08:20.840] But maybe this family operates in this other way that is very similar to how my family operates.
[00:08:20.840] 但也许这个家庭的运作方式与我的家庭非常相似。
[00:08:25.460] So there's definitely lots of similarities and differences.
[00:08:25.460] 所以两者之间肯定有很多相似之处和不同之处。
[00:08:29.020] And it's crazy too because as someone who's mostly dated people who are also Chinese, it's interesting to see how similar yet different other families in the same culture can end up being.
[00:08:29.020] 而且这也很疯狂，因为我交往过的对象大多也是中国人，所以看到同一文化背景下的其他家庭最终会如此相似又如此不同，真的很有意思。
[00:08:44.260] That's a really good point because I feel like one of the things we've talked about maybe a long time ago now, but it was something about how we as like 1.5 or second generation kids, we tend to attribute a lot of what our parents and our family customs are to our motherland culture.
[00:08:44.260] 这确实是一个很好的观点，因为我觉得我们可能很久以前就讨论过这个问题，那就是我们这些1.5代或第二代移民的孩子，往往会把我们父母和家庭习俗中的很多东西归因于我们的祖国文化。
[00:09:03.760] So like a lot of what my parents do, I'm always like, oh, it's because we're Korean.
[00:09:03.760] 所以，对于我父母做的很多事情，我总是会想，哦，那是因为我们是韩国人。
[00:09:06.920] That's why we do this.
[00:09:06.920] 这就是我们这样做的原因。
[00:09:07.760] But then you meet other Korean families or other Chinese families or whatever, and you're like, oh, it's not like a Korean or Chinese thing.
[00:09:07.760] 但当你遇到其他韩国家庭或其他中国家庭时，你就会想，哦，这并不像韩国或中国特有的事情。
[00:09:13.600] It's like an our family thing.
[00:09:13.600] 这就像是我们家的传统。
[00:09:15.540] Like that I feel like in itself is so odd to realize.
[00:09:15.540] 我觉得意识到这一点本身就很奇怪。
[00:09:18.560] Right.
[00:09:18.560] 正确的。
[00:09:18.980] You're like, oh, this is actually just my mom and dad's personality, I guess.
[00:09:18.980] 你会想，哦，这其实就是我爸妈的性格吧。
[00:09:23.640] But yeah, I think back to the original point, I'm definitely someone who tries to visit family or like be with family during holidays.
[00:09:23.640] 但是，回到最初的观点，我绝对是那种会在假期里尽量去看望家人或者和家人在一起的人。
[00:09:32.900] So I think that is another display of my values.
[00:09:32.900] 所以我认为这再次体现了我的价值观。
[00:09:36.760] And so because I tend to lean towards doing those kinds of things, I hope that my partner would also find value in spending time with their family.
[00:09:36.760] 因为我倾向于做这类事情，所以我希望我的伴侣也能觉得和家人共度时光很有价值。
[00:09:47.260] And I would never want to stop that from happening.
[00:09:47.260] 我绝不会想阻止这件事发生。
[00:09:50.480] I think that's a good point.
[00:09:50.480] 我觉得你说得很有道理。
[00:09:51.660] It's actually not necessarily about familiarity, I guess, or like what you're used to.
[00:09:51.660] 其实这并不一定与熟悉程度有关，或者说与你习惯的事物有关。
[00:09:56.520] So like even if your SO has a familial culture that's very different from what you're raised in, it doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good match.
[00:09:56.520] 所以，即使你的另一半的家庭文化与你成长的环境截然不同，也并不一定意味着你们不合适。
[00:10:03.960] But I feel like it is more like aligning your needs and interests together.
[00:10:03.960] 但我感觉这更像是将你的需求和兴趣结合起来。
[00:10:08.220] So a common example I've seen, you might have certain gripes about your family or how your family likes to hang out or something like that.
[00:10:08.220] 我见过的一个常见例子是，你可能对你的家庭或者你的家人喜欢如何聚会之类的事情有一些不满。
[00:10:15.160] But you're able to fulfill that need from your SO's family.
[00:10:15.160] 但你可以通过伴侣的家人来满足这个需求。
[00:10:18.760] So I feel like when things like that work out perfectly, it's just so ideal.
[00:10:18.760] 所以我觉得，当这类事情进展得非常顺利的时候，简直太理想了。
[00:10:22.940] On this topic, do you think it would be a deal breaker if your SO wasn't super close to their family, but they still valued yours in the way that you wanted?
[00:10:22.940] 关于这个问题，如果你的另一半与对方的家人关系不是特别亲密，但他们仍然以你希望的方式重视你的家人，你认为这会成为你们关系破裂的原因吗？
[00:10:35.580] You know, like spending the time and getting to know them and that kind of stuff.
[00:10:35.580] 你知道，就像花时间去了解他们之类的。
[00:10:39.760] You know, I feel like if I was younger, I would say that it would be a deal breaker for me.
[00:10:39.760] 你知道，我觉得如果我年轻一些，我会说这对我来说是绝对不能接受的。
[00:10:45.680] But I think the older I get and the more that I see, I actually don't think it's a deal breaker.
[00:10:45.680] 但我觉得年纪越大，见识越广，其实这并不算什么大问题。
[00:10:50.540] Because like you said, if my SO is willing to put in the time and effort and feels a lot of genuine appreciation for my parents and my family,
[00:10:50.540] 正如你所说，如果我的伴侣愿意投入时间和精力，并且对我的父母和家人怀有真挚的感激之情，
[00:10:59.880] then that could be what fulfills our family aspect, I guess, in our life.
[00:10:59.880] 我想，这或许就是我们生活中满足家庭需求的方式吧。
[00:11:04.860] So it doesn't necessarily have to be whatever circumstance you grew up in is your ultimate fate.
[00:11:04.860] 所以，你成长的环境并不一定决定了你的最终命运。
[00:11:11.260] I feel like there could be a lot of good harmony and a synergy that comes from like bringing two people's separate lives together.
[00:11:11.260] 我觉得把两个人的独立生活融合在一起，可能会产生很多和谐与协同效应。
[00:11:18.540] But I will say that it's not always rainbows and butterflies.
[00:11:18.540] 但我必须说，生活并非总是充满阳光和美好。
[00:11:22.220] I feel like there are plenty of times where there might be a little bit of friction that someone might have with their SO's parents.
[00:11:22.220] 我觉得很多时候，伴侣和他们的父母之间可能会出现一些摩擦。
[00:11:27.740] Or maybe it's the case that your SO has a difficult relationship with their parents and that leaks into your relationship.
[00:11:27.740] 或者，也许是你的伴侣与父母关系不好，而这种关系影响到了你们的感情。
[00:11:33.580] So things like that, I think, are not uncommon.
[00:11:33.580] 所以我觉得，诸如此类的事情并不罕见。
[00:11:37.540] Just something that you have to work through.
[00:11:37.540] 这是你必须克服的难关。
[00:11:39.940] Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:39.940] 是啊是啊。
[00:11:40.780] I think that would take a lot of contemplation about what the right decisions are for you and your relationship.
[00:11:40.780] 我认为你需要仔细思考，才能做出对你和你们的关系来说正确的决定。
[00:11:48.460] But I do think it's totally fair to ultimately have to end a relationship because of just difficult connections with the parents.
[00:11:48.460] 但我认为，如果仅仅因为与父母关系紧张而最终不得不结束一段感情，也是完全合理的。
[00:11:58.600] Sometimes as difficult as it is, that might end up being like the best decision.
[00:11:58.600] 有时候，尽管很难做到，但这最终可能反而是最好的决定。
[00:12:03.960] But yeah, as you've said, it really just depends on the situation and being able to sit with your decision.
[00:12:03.960] 但是，正如你所说，这真的取决于具体情况以及你是否能够接受自己的决定。
[00:12:11.840] Okay, but what if your parents disapproved of your significant other?
[00:12:11.840] 好吧，但如果你的父母不赞成你的另一半呢？
[00:12:19.400] Man, honestly, I feel like the relationship that I have with my parents, that would be a deal breaker for me if my parents approved of my SO.
[00:12:19.400] 老实说，我觉得如果我的父母认可我的另一半，那我跟父母的关系对我来说就是个大问题。
[00:12:27.760] I think it would be really hard for me to move forward.
[00:12:27.760] 我觉得我很难继续前进。
[00:12:30.620] I mean, maybe if I was actually in this situation, I would feel differently.
[00:12:30.620] 我的意思是，如果我真的身处这种情况，也许我的感受会不一样。
[00:12:34.580] But just on a theory level, I don't think I would be able to move on past that.
[00:12:34.580] 但仅从理论层面来说，我认为我无法超越这一点。
[00:12:39.940] Yeah, you know, I think that would apply to me too because my parents are usually so chill.
[00:12:39.940] 是啊，我觉得这对我来说也适用，因为我的父母通常都很随和。
[00:12:45.340] So if someone I was dating made my parents tell me specifically, I don't like this person.
[00:12:45.340] 所以如果我约会的对象让我的父母明确地告诉我，我不喜欢这个人。
[00:12:51.860] Like, I don't think you should be with them.
[00:12:51.860] 我觉得你不应该和他们在一起。
[00:12:53.400] I would really take note of that.
[00:12:53.400] 我会认真记下这一点。
[00:12:55.360] This person has something that bothers my parents so much that they felt the need to like explicitly tell me and bring it up.
[00:12:55.360] 这个人身上有件让我父母非常困扰的事，以至于他们觉得有必要特意告诉我，并提起这件事。
[00:13:03.120] Right.
[00:13:03.120] 正确的。
[00:13:04.080] Yeah.
[00:13:04.080] 是的。
[00:13:04.380] And for me too, I feel like one, I'm an only child.
[00:13:04.380] 对我来说，我也感觉像个独生子，因为我是独生子女。
[00:13:07.840] So my entire family is my parents, you know?
[00:13:07.840] 所以，我的整个家庭就是我的父母，你知道吗？
[00:13:11.000] And then two, I think there are a lot of really independent people out there.
[00:13:11.000] 其次，我认为世界上有很多非常独立的人。
[00:13:15.100] I don't think I would necessarily call myself super independent.
[00:13:15.100] 我并不认为自己非常独立。
[00:13:18.340] And I just am someone who prefers to see my parents a lot.
[00:13:18.340] 我就是那种更喜欢多和父母待在一起的人。
[00:13:21.720] So then if they were to have a bad relationship with my SO, who I would presumably want to make a husband, that would make it really complicated.
[00:13:21.720] 所以，如果他们和我未来的伴侣（我大概会想让他成为我的丈夫）关系不好，那事情就会变得非常复杂。
[00:13:30.420] So I think it just would be a little bit tough.
[00:13:30.420] 所以我觉得这会有点困难。
[00:13:32.600] I guess it's difficult for us to truly say because like we very luckily never had to experience these.
[00:13:32.600] 我想我们很难真正说清楚，因为我们非常幸运地从未经历过这些。
[00:13:39.080] And I feel like once you're actually in the moment of this happening, there's a lot of different factors and like thoughts and you just don't know where you might end up.
[00:13:39.080] 我觉得一旦你真正置身于这件事发生的那一刻，就会有很多不同的因素和想法，你根本不知道最终会走到哪一步。
[00:13:49.520] Yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:13:49.520] 没错，这确实是个很好的观点。
[00:13:51.160] I'm trying to imagine if I met someone who I was like, okay, this is the love of my life, but my parents ended up not being very fond of them.
[00:13:51.160] 我试着想象，如果我遇到一个人，我觉得，好吧，这就是我生命中的挚爱，但我的父母最终却不太喜欢他/她。
[00:13:59.360] If this was like the perfect person, I guess I would prioritize them over my parents because philosophically, I think it should outweigh your parents' decision because this is someone you would spend the rest of your life with.
[00:13:59.360] 如果这是个完美的人，我想我会把他们放在父母之前，因为从哲学角度来说，我认为这应该比父母的决定更重要，因为这是你要共度余生的人。
[00:14:14.240] That's fair.
[00:14:14.240] 这很合理。
[00:14:15.040] You're probably going to be with them closer to like 24-7-ish.
[00:14:15.040] 你大概会和他们朝夕相处，差不多一天24小时都在一起。
[00:14:19.500] Right.
[00:14:19.500] 正确的。
[00:14:19.900] Versus your parents who you more likely aren't going to be living under the same roof with once you're married.
[00:14:19.900] 相比之下，你结婚后很可能不会和父母住在一起。
[00:14:27.100] Or, you know, you might not even be in the same state.
[00:14:27.100] 或者，你知道，你们甚至可能不在同一个州。
[00:14:30.200] So ultimately, the majority of your time is with this significant other.
[00:14:30.200] 所以归根结底，你大部分时间都和你的另一半在一起。
[00:14:34.400] So there's just like so much to think about.
[00:14:34.400] 所以有很多事情需要考虑。
[00:14:36.960] I know.
[00:14:36.960] 我知道。
[00:14:38.540] I feel like this is actually why there is a sweet spot of when you should meet your SO's parents or introduce your SO to your parents because in an ideal world, everyone loves each other.
[00:14:38.540] 我觉得这其实就是为什么应该找个合适的时机见见伴侣的父母或者把伴侣介绍给自己的父母的原因，因为在理想的世界里，每个人都彼此相爱。
[00:14:50.320] It's all very happy and nothing but pleasant.
[00:14:50.320] 一切都非常愉快，令人开心。
[00:14:53.460] But to be honest, I think it's very easy for people's opinions to sway you.
[00:14:53.460] 但说实话，我觉得人们的意见很容易左右你。
[00:14:59.560] And for someone like me, who I am very easily swayed by other people's opinions, I think it would not be doing my SO justice to like introduce them too early.
[00:14:59.560] 而对于像我这样很容易受到他人意见影响的人来说，我觉得过早地把他们介绍给我的另一半是不公平的。
[00:15:08.920] Because what if, you know, your parents don't end up liking your SO?
[00:15:08.920] 万一，你知道，你的父母最终不喜欢你的另一半呢？
[00:15:12.060] Then you might prematurely be like, oh, okay, I don't know.
[00:15:12.060] 然后你可能会过早地想，哦，好吧，我不知道。
[00:15:15.220] That might be a bad sign, blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:15.220] 那可能是一个不好的迹象，等等等等。
[00:15:17.180] But in reality, you might not have given this relationship a fair shot.
[00:15:17.180] 但实际上，你可能并没有给这段感情一个公平的机会。
[00:15:21.300] I think the sweet spot to like meeting the parents needs to be, I don't know, I guess like at least a year is what I would assume.
[00:15:21.300] 我觉得见家长比较合适的时机应该是，嗯，我猜至少要一年吧。
[00:15:30.580] Okay, but what if you have a really strong feeling and you're like, I feel like it would just work out if they met them early.
[00:15:30.580] 好吧，但如果你有一种非常强烈的感觉，觉得如果他们早点见面，事情就会顺利很多呢？
[00:15:38.340] Would you just go ahead and do it?
[00:15:38.340] 你打算就这么做吗？
[00:15:40.300] Yeah, I guess so.
[00:15:40.300] 嗯，我想也是。
[00:15:41.640] I mean, when you're actually in this situation, all you want to do is be like, oh my God, this was so wonderful.
[00:15:41.640] 我的意思是，当你真正身处这种情况时，你只想说，哦我的天哪，这真是太棒了。
[00:15:46.640] Like I want to introduce them to everyone in my life.
[00:15:46.640] 我真想把它们介绍给我生活中的每一个人。
[00:15:48.600] But I don't know, maybe the smarter thing or like the wiser thing to do is to vibe check how things will go.
[00:15:48.600] 但我不知道，或许更明智的做法是先感受一下事情会如何发展。
[00:15:56.000] Yeah.
[00:15:56.000] 是的。
[00:15:56.680] Because I will say some families are less formal in that way and they're more okay with meeting someone.
[00:15:56.680] 因为我想说，有些家庭在这方面没那么讲究，他们更乐于接受与人见面。
[00:16:03.540] It's fine if it doesn't work out, etc.
[00:16:03.540] 如果结果不尽如人意也没关系，等等。
[00:16:05.600] Versus other families, I feel like things have to be very formal and structured.
[00:16:05.600] 与其他家庭相比，我觉得我们家的一切都必须非常正式和有条理。
[00:16:08.900] So it probably is just different family by family too.
[00:16:08.900] 所以可能每个家庭的情况都不一样。
[00:16:12.500] Yeah, that's a fair point.
[00:16:12.500] 嗯，这说得有道理。
[00:16:13.940] I think also age probably matters.
[00:16:13.940] 我认为年龄可能也是一个因素。
[00:16:16.140] If this is someone you started dating in, you know, as early as high school or college, you probably will end up waiting a little longer for them to meet your parents.
[00:16:16.140] 如果你和这个人从高中或大学就开始约会，那么你可能要等更长时间才能让他/她见你的父母。
[00:16:26.100] Because those years are so tumultuous and usually invite a lot of possible change.
[00:16:26.100] 因为那几年动荡不安，通常会带来很多变化。
[00:16:31.860] The timeline then is different than say if you're 25 to 30 and you're much more stable and are looking towards, you know, the next steps of your life.
[00:16:31.860] 那么，时间线就和 25 到 30 岁的人不一样了，那时你的生活更加稳定，正在展望人生的下一个阶段。
[00:16:44.580] Then maybe that timeline could be a little more expedited.
[00:16:44.580] 那么或许可以加快进度。
[00:16:47.840] Whoa, that's actually a crazy point because my last like dating experience is my husband who I met and started dating in like 2014, 2015.
[00:16:47.840] 哇，这真是个不可思议的点，因为我上一次约会经历就是和我的丈夫，我们是在 2014 年、2015 年认识并开始约会的。
[00:16:59.940] So you could clearly see it's been a long time.
[00:16:59.940] 所以很明显，时间已经过去很久了。
[00:17:03.020] Yeah.
[00:17:03.020] 是的。
[00:17:03.360] And I think when you're that young, your parents' opinions kind of matter more, I would say.
[00:17:03.360] 我认为，当你年纪还小的时候，父母的意见就显得更重要了。
[00:17:09.080] Versus when you're older, like you already have your defined tastes and you are very sure of yourself and might feel way more independent as a person.
[00:17:09.080] 而当你年纪大了，已经有了自己明确的喜好，对自己非常有信心，并且可能会觉得自己作为一个人更加独立时，情况就不同了。
[00:17:17.160] So then maybe all of this parental stuff is weighed a little bit less.
[00:17:17.160] 那么，所有这些与父母有关的事情或许就不那么重要了。
[00:17:21.380] You almost are more equal with your parents.
[00:17:21.380] 你几乎和父母更平等了。
[00:17:24.340] It's not like, oh my God, here's my SO.
[00:17:24.340] 这并不是说，哦我的天哪，我的另一半来了。
[00:17:27.040] Please approve of them.
[00:17:27.040] 请批准它们。
[00:17:28.120] It's more like, hey, this is my SO.
[00:17:28.120] 更像是，嘿，这是我的另一半。
[00:17:29.940] I want you to meet them.
[00:17:29.940] 我想让你见见他们。
[00:17:31.240] Right, right.
[00:17:31.240] 对，对。
[00:17:32.240] I do want to ask because clearly meeting the parents is a big deal regardless of age.
[00:17:32.240] 我确实想问一下，因为无论年龄大小，见家长显然都是一件大事。
[00:17:38.500] Do you think there are any tips that you might have or things that you've learned to try to impress parents when you meet them?
[00:17:38.500] 你觉得在与父母见面时，有什么技巧或经验可以分享，用来给他们留下好印象吗？
[00:17:45.200] Ooh, dude, I don't even know.
[00:17:45.200] 哦，老兄，我也不知道。
[00:17:48.040] I guess the classic, I think this is kind of like an Asian cultural thing, is like bring a small gift if you're visiting their home.
[00:17:48.040] 我想，这大概是亚洲文化的一种传统，就是去别人家拜访时带一份小礼物。
[00:17:56.880] It doesn't have to be anything like crazy.
[00:17:56.880] 不必非得像疯了一样。
[00:17:59.580] Something really simple like snacks or like fruit.
[00:17:59.580] 一些很简单的东西，比如零食或水果。
[00:18:03.020] And I think it's even better if it's something that can be shared around the table.
[00:18:03.020] 我觉得如果能和大家一起分享就更好了。
[00:18:07.000] So things I've done in the past include bringing mooncakes when it was kind of close to the mooncake holiday.
[00:18:07.000] 所以，我过去做过的事情包括在中秋节临近的时候带月饼。
[00:18:14.200] And then that way we could all eat it for dessert after dinner around the table.
[00:18:14.200] 这样一来，我们就可以饭后围坐在餐桌旁，把它当做甜点享用了。
[00:18:19.240] You know, it's nothing terribly expensive.
[00:18:19.240] 你知道，它其实并不贵。
[00:18:21.180] So you don't want to make the host feel burdened about it.
[00:18:21.180] 所以你不想让主人感到负担。
[00:18:24.960] But they could also hopefully feel thankful that you brought something to show your thanks.
[00:18:24.960] 但他们或许也会因为你带了礼物来表达谢意而感到感激。
[00:18:31.000] Oh, that's a good one.
[00:18:31.000] 哦，这个不错。
[00:18:32.420] I feel like it is a simple tip, but it really goes so far.
[00:18:32.420] 我觉得这是一个很简单的建议，但它真的非常实用。
[00:18:36.180] And I think what you said about the gift not being super extravagant is also pretty key, actually.
[00:18:36.180] 而且我觉得你说的礼物不要太奢华这一点也相当关键。
[00:18:42.240] Because you don't want to be bringing in like a huge showstopper three-tier cake on like a casual family dinner or something.
[00:18:42.240] 因为你肯定不想在普通的家庭聚餐之类的场合，拿出那种惊艳全场的三层蛋糕。
[00:18:48.560] And I don't know about other people's parents, but personally, my parents would probably be a tad put off by a really expensive gift the first time meeting someone.
[00:18:48.560] 我不知道其他人的父母怎么想，但就我个人而言，如果第一次见面就收到非常昂贵的礼物，我的父母可能会有点反感。
[00:19:00.340] They'd be like, oh, is this person trying to like prove something?
[00:19:00.340] 他们会想，哦，这个人是不是想证明什么？
[00:19:03.600] Or what is the meaning of this?
[00:19:03.600] 或者，这句话是什么意思？
[00:19:05.660] And my parents are pretty chill.
[00:19:05.660] 我父母性格都很随和。
[00:19:07.040] So they're kind of just like, if you bring like, you know, some fruit, that's totally fine.
[00:19:07.040] 所以他们的态度大概是，如果你带些水果之类的，完全没问题。
[00:19:11.060] Or just something that shows a bit of meaning, but nothing too over the top.
[00:19:11.060] 或者只是表达一点意义，但又不会太过分。
[00:19:14.780] I feel like another tip is, I mean, this is half just common courtesy, but it's to just come with a very polite attitude and be ready to impress.
[00:19:14.780] 我觉得另一个建议是，这虽然一半是基本的礼貌，但就是要带着非常礼貌的态度来，并准备好给人留下深刻印象。
[00:19:26.900] And I feel like impressing is not always bragging about your skills or trying to show off.
[00:19:26.900] 我觉得给人留下深刻印象并不总是吹嘘自己的技能或试图炫耀。
[00:19:32.220] But impressing is just being very well-mannered, right?
[00:19:32.220] 但给人留下深刻印象不就是举止得体吗？
[00:19:34.700] Like giving a good handshake or a hug if you prefer that, depending.
[00:19:34.700] 比如，如果你喜欢的话，可以握手或者拥抱。
[00:19:38.660] But you have to kind of like suss that out, I think.
[00:19:38.660] 但我觉得你得自己去琢磨琢磨。
[00:19:40.620] And also just being like interested in what is happening around the dinner table, asking questions.
[00:19:40.620] 而且，他还会对餐桌上发生的事情感兴趣，并提出问题。
[00:19:46.760] I feel like putting in the effort is very obvious and always very appreciated, especially by adults.
[00:19:46.760] 我觉得付出努力是显而易见的，而且总是会受到赞赏，尤其是受到成年人的赞赏。
[00:19:53.400] Oh, I guess also I didn't clarify.
[00:19:53.400] 哦，我想我也没有说清楚。
[00:19:55.600] I think the gift is more for like visiting a person's home versus maybe if your first meeting is just at dinner at a restaurant,
[00:19:55.600] 我觉得送礼更适合拜访别人家，而不是像第一次见面只是在餐厅吃饭那样。
[00:20:05.220] then you might not need to bring a gift necessarily just because you're in a public space and you don't want to like make a scene or that kind of stuff.
[00:20:05.220] 那么，你可能就不一定需要带礼物了，因为你身处公共场所，不想引起骚动之类的。
[00:20:15.020] And I was thinking as you were talking through the concept of being polite,
[00:20:15.020] 当你在讲解礼貌的概念时，我一直在想：
[00:20:18.620] I also try not to be on my phone when I'm with these people, especially if it's like at a restaurant.
[00:20:18.620] 我和这些人在一起的时候也会尽量避免玩手机，尤其是在像餐厅这样的场合。
[00:20:26.080] And I try to like keep my phone just away, hidden, silenced if it needs to be.
[00:20:26.080] 我尽量把手机放在远离我的地方，藏起来，必要时调成静音。
[00:20:31.260] That way you can show you're fully engaged and happy to be there and excited to meet them.
[00:20:31.260] 这样可以表明你全身心投入，很高兴能来到这里，并且很期待见到他们。
[00:20:36.880] I think it would look kind of weird if you're meeting them for the first time and you're just always checking your phone.
[00:20:36.880] 我觉得如果你第一次见他们，却一直低头看手机，会显得很奇怪。
[00:20:41.640] It's like, okay, are we keeping you for something?
[00:20:41.640] 这就像，好吧，我们留着你是为了什么事吗？
[00:20:46.040] Great point. You don't want to be an iPad kid on your first time meeting parents.
[00:20:46.040] 说得对。你肯定不想第一次见家长的时候就变成一个只会玩iPad的孩子。
[00:20:51.380] I think another thing too is dressing modestly.
[00:20:51.380] 我认为还有一点也很重要，那就是穿着要得体。
[00:20:55.740] Like I will say there are outfits that are more parent appropriate than others.
[00:20:55.740] 我觉得有些服装比其他服装更适合家长穿着。
[00:21:00.600] And it's actually not necessarily just like, oh, don't wear like a low cut top.
[00:21:00.600] 其实并不一定只是像“哦，不要穿低胸上衣”那样。
[00:21:05.020] I feel like it's also just generally this isn't the time for you to be dressed to impress, like fashionista, super fancy.
[00:21:05.020] 我觉得现在也不是你穿得光鲜亮丽、像个时尚达人、超级华丽的时候。
[00:21:13.080] I feel like there's a way to dress nice without necessarily being the center of attention.
[00:21:13.080] 我觉得穿得好看并不一定非要成为众人瞩目的焦点。
[00:21:20.180] Outfits are a huge thing as well.
[00:21:20.180] 服装搭配也非常重要。
[00:21:22.740] So true. Oh my God.
[00:21:22.740] 说得太对了。我的天哪。
[00:21:24.060] I'm just imagining like you showing up to dinner with like your SO's parents and you sit down and you like slam this thousands of dollars designer bag on the table.
[00:21:24.060] 我想象一下，你和伴侣的父母一起去吃饭，坐下后，你把一个价值数千美元的名牌包重重地摔在桌子上。
[00:21:35.000] And everyone's just like, okay, pull out your phone.
[00:21:35.000] 然后大家就都说，好了，拿出你的手机。
[00:21:39.800] You're like constantly on your phone.
[00:21:39.800] 你好像总是低头玩手机。
[00:21:41.400] This is like the worst first impression you could be making.
[00:21:41.400] 这简直是你能给人留下的最糟糕的第一印象。
[00:21:44.980] So you're absolutely right.
[00:21:44.980] 所以你的说法完全正确。
[00:21:46.320] Like match the vibe of the restaurant at the very least.
[00:21:46.320] 至少要和餐厅的氛围相符。
[00:21:49.700] If it's a nicer restaurant, definitely, of course, dress up a little bit.
[00:21:49.700] 如果是比较高档的餐厅，当然要稍微打扮一下。
[00:21:53.520] But imagine dressing up for like just some random Chinese restaurant.
[00:21:53.520] 但想象一下，你只是为了去一家普通的中国餐馆而盛装打扮。
[00:21:57.740] And you're like bedazzled.
[00:21:57.740] 你简直被迷住了。
[00:22:00.440] And everyone's like, uh.
[00:22:00.440] 然后大家都会说，呃。
[00:22:03.240] I know.
[00:22:03.240] 我知道。
[00:22:04.100] And I feel like people can tell when you're wearing stuff that's uncomfortable, kind of.
[00:22:04.100] 我觉得别人能看出你穿的衣服是否不舒服。
[00:22:08.120] If you don't feel super comfortable in like six inch heels, maybe don't wear six inch heels to dinner.
[00:22:08.120] 如果你觉得穿六英寸的高跟鞋不太自在，那也许就不要穿六英寸的高跟鞋去吃晚餐。
[00:22:13.920] Things like that.
[00:22:13.920] 诸如此类的事情。
[00:22:14.560] Just like set yourself up for success and like try to be as much of yourself as possible.
[00:22:14.560] 就像为成功做好准备一样，并且尽可能地做真实的自己。
[00:22:19.680] Because I think just as people our age can kind of see through that stuff, I feel like that skill to see through these things is just amplified when you're older.
[00:22:19.680] 因为我觉得，就像我们这个年纪的人能够看穿那些事情一样，我觉得这种看穿这些事情的能力在年纪越大的时候就越强。
[00:22:29.480] You know, comes with the years of experience.
[00:22:29.480] 你知道，这是多年经验积累的结果。
[00:22:31.580] So making sure you're dressed as comfortably but nicely as possible.
[00:22:31.580] 所以，一定要确保穿着既舒适又得体。
[00:22:35.920] I also think, I guess on the flip side, like if you're the person with the parents at the dinner table,
[00:22:35.920] 我想，反过来想，比如如果你是和父母一起吃饭的那个人，
[00:22:42.720] it's also kind of your duty to get the conversation flowing between your parents and your SO.
[00:22:42.720] 你也有义务促成父母和伴侣之间的对话。
[00:22:49.680] You know, making sure that your SO is involved.
[00:22:49.680] 你知道，要确保你的另一半参与其中。
[00:22:52.600] That your parents and them have a chance to like ask each other questions and talk about things.
[00:22:52.600] 这样你的父母和他们就有机会互相提问、交谈。
[00:22:58.380] Because it's pretty difficult to like chat with new people, let alone your significant other's parents.
[00:22:58.380] 因为和陌生人聊天本来就很难，更何况是和伴侣的父母聊天。
[00:23:06.500] Right.
[00:23:06.500] 正确的。
[00:23:06.920] So I think that is an important role.
[00:23:06.920] 所以我认为这是一个非常重要的角色。
[00:23:09.380] I feel like it could be at the dinner table or before the dinner table too.
[00:23:09.380] 我觉得这可能发生在餐桌上，也可能发生在餐桌之前。
[00:23:13.640] So one of the things is if you know either your parents or maybe your SO is going to bring a gift,
[00:23:13.640] 所以其中一种方法是，如果你知道你的父母或者你的伴侣会带礼物来，
[00:23:19.780] you don't want it to be awkward where one person is giving a gift and the other person is completely shocked and maybe potentially thinking like,
[00:23:19.780] 你肯定不希望出现那种尴尬的场面：一方送礼物，另一方却完全懵了，甚至可能心里想着：
[00:23:27.460] oh shit, should I have brought a gift?
[00:23:27.460] 糟了，我应该带礼物吗？
[00:23:29.100] So if you know someone's going to do that, you probably want to let the other person know too.
[00:23:29.100] 所以，如果你知道某人会这样做，你最好也让对方知道。
[00:23:33.160] Things like that I think can help people feel more at ease and like know what to expect at the dinner.
[00:23:33.160] 我认为诸如此类的事情可以帮助人们感到更自在，并让他们知道晚宴上会发生什么。
[00:23:38.780] And the other thing is maybe beforehand you want to prep the other person like just so you know,
[00:23:38.780] 还有一件事，或许你想事先跟对方打个招呼，比如让你知道……
[00:23:43.200] this person has this kind of background.
[00:23:43.200] 这个人有这样的背景。
[00:23:45.340] You guys have these similarities.
[00:23:45.340] 你们之间有这些相似之处。
[00:23:46.280] So maybe you can bring these things up at the dinner table.
[00:23:46.280] 所以或许你可以在餐桌上谈谈这些事情。
[00:23:49.060] This dinner shouldn't be like a huge surprise for everyone and like improv, you know,
[00:23:49.060] 这顿晚餐不应该让每个人都感到意外，就像即兴表演一样，你知道的。
[00:23:53.120] like it's fine to kind of clue people in on their similarities or hot topics.
[00:23:53.120] 好像可以稍微提醒一下人们他们的相似之处或热门话题。
[00:23:57.480] So I think the prep work could be there as well.
[00:23:57.480] 所以我认为前期准备工作也应该到位了。
[00:23:59.940] Yes.
[00:23:59.940] 是的。
[00:24:00.780] My boyfriend told his parents that I'm like kind of quiet.
[00:24:00.780] 我男朋友跟他父母说我性格比较安静。
[00:24:04.420] My voice is literally quiet.
[00:24:04.420] 我的声音非常小。
[00:24:06.060] And they're like, oh, thank you for sharing.
[00:24:06.060] 他们会说，哦，谢谢你的分享。
[00:24:07.720] We'll pay more attention.
[00:24:07.720] 我们会更加重视。
[00:24:10.720] He also told me that one of his parents has a bit of a hard time hearing sometimes.
[00:24:10.720] 他还告诉我，他的父母中有一位有时听力不太好。
[00:24:16.380] So he's like, make sure to like speak up.
[00:24:16.380] 所以他就说，一定要大声说话。
[00:24:18.340] And I was like, okay, I'll try my best.
[00:24:18.340] 我当时想，好吧，我会尽力而为。
[00:24:21.380] I feel like as awkward as these things could be, you just want to do everything you possibly can to
[00:24:21.380] 我觉得虽然这些事情可能很尴尬，但你还是想尽一切可能去做。
[00:24:28.260] ease the awkwardness and just make it a happy event.
[00:24:28.260] 缓解尴尬气氛，让它成为一件快乐的事情。
[00:24:31.300] I think another big thing too is us both coming from kind of immigrant families.
[00:24:31.300] 我觉得另一个重要因素是我们俩都来自移民家庭。
[00:24:36.240] Language could also be a big barrier sometimes.
[00:24:36.240] 语言有时也可能成为很大的障碍。
[00:24:39.040] So if you have a parent that might not be as comfortable speaking English,
[00:24:39.040] 所以，如果你的父母中有人不太擅长说英语，
[00:24:43.300] you definitely want to, I think, show up with your best like translator ability.
[00:24:43.300] 我认为，你肯定希望展现出你最好的翻译能力。
[00:24:47.480] So just making sure everyone is aware of that beforehand as well.
[00:24:47.480] 所以，也需要确保大家事先都了解这一点。
[00:24:51.420] And I feel like you probably have more experience than me dealing with this,
[00:24:51.420] 我觉得你在这方面可能比我更有经验。
[00:24:55.460] where you kind of have to play translator sometimes.
[00:24:55.460] 有时候你得扮演翻译的角色。
[00:24:58.120] How difficult do you think it feels to have to like kind of translate back and forth?
[00:24:58.120] 你觉得来回翻译的感觉有多难？
[00:25:04.080] I feel like the translating aspect, just language wise, is actually not that hard.
[00:25:04.080] 我觉得就语言而言，翻译本身其实并不难。
[00:25:10.060] What I find really difficult is like knowing when to cut in and translate stuff.
[00:25:10.060] 我觉得最难的是知道什么时候该插话翻译。
[00:25:15.180] Because sometimes like what is being said is very simple.
[00:25:15.180] 因为有时候，所说的话其实很简单。
[00:25:18.260] Like someone might be like, oh, I ate here once.
[00:25:18.260] 比如有人可能会说，哦，我曾经在这里吃过一次。
[00:25:21.040] You know, that's like very obviously understood by a lot of people.
[00:25:21.040] 你知道，这一点很多人都非常清楚。
[00:25:24.560] And then sometimes I'm like, do I need to translate that?
[00:25:24.560] 有时我会想，我需要翻译这个吗？
[00:25:26.920] Or like, should I just leave it as is?
[00:25:26.920] 或者，我应该就这么放着不管吗？
[00:25:29.280] So I think the timing of making the translations without making the conversation really awkward
[00:25:29.280] 所以我觉得关键在于把握好翻译的时机，既要保证对话不至于太尴尬。
[00:25:33.840] or like stilted is really difficult.
[00:25:33.840] 或者说，像个木偶一样真的很难。
[00:25:35.980] Oh my God, actually the funniest thing kind of happened.
[00:25:35.980] 我的天哪，其实发生了一件特别搞笑的事。
[00:25:38.300] So my brother has a girlfriend who doesn't speak Chinese.
[00:25:38.300] 我哥哥有个不会说中文的女朋友。
[00:25:42.360] And in my household, we speak a lot of Chinese just because my parents,
[00:25:42.360] 在我家，我们经常说中文，因为我的父母……
[00:25:47.140] they're like, our English isn't that great.
[00:25:47.140] 他们说，我们的英语不太好。
[00:25:49.200] So like one time it was all of us eating dinner together,
[00:25:49.200] 有一次，我们所有人一起吃晚饭。
[00:25:53.160] like me, my brother, his girlfriend, and like my parents.
[00:25:53.160] 就像我、我的兄弟、他的女朋友，还有我的父母一样。
[00:25:56.380] And I think they were just so not used to the idea of someone who doesn't speak Chinese being with us.
[00:25:56.380] 我认为他们只是很不习惯和不会说中文的人在一起。
[00:26:04.860] Like they kept forgetting to translate.
[00:26:04.860] 好像他们总是忘记翻译似的。
[00:26:07.120] And I was like, oh my God, like this poor girl doesn't know why everyone's laughing.
[00:26:07.120] 我当时就想，我的天哪，这个可怜的女孩不知道为什么大家都在笑。
[00:26:11.080] So I was like trying my best to translate.
[00:26:11.080] 所以我当时就尽力去翻译。
[00:26:15.020] And you're right.
[00:26:15.020] 你说得对。
[00:26:15.780] Sometimes you don't know.
[00:26:15.780] 有时候你并不知道。
[00:26:17.260] You're like, I'll just let that one slide.
[00:26:17.260] 你会想，我就不计较这件事了。
[00:26:19.160] You know, that one wasn't important.
[00:26:19.160] 你知道，那件事并不重要。
[00:26:20.900] But I think the times I tried my hardest to translate was when everyone would like burst out laughing.
[00:26:20.900] 但我认为，我最努力翻译的时候，大家都会突然大笑起来。
[00:26:25.960] And I'm like, oh no, she's not in on the joke.
[00:26:25.960] 我当时就想，哦不，她没听懂这个玩笑。
[00:26:28.140] I need to let her know.
[00:26:28.140] 我需要让她知道。
[00:26:29.900] I will say it's actually super helpful when there's multiple people at the table helping to translate.
[00:26:29.900] 我想说，如果有多人同桌帮忙翻译，那确实非常有帮助。
[00:26:35.140] And it's not just all on the SO.
[00:26:35.140] 而且这不仅仅发生在SO上。
[00:26:37.720] Because it can be really tiring and not just tiring,
[00:26:37.720] 因为它不仅会让人疲惫，而且会让人非常疲惫。
[00:26:40.740] but sometimes it can cause like these weird issues where if you're translating a lot,
[00:26:40.740] 但有时候，如果你翻译的内容很多，就会出现一些奇怪的问题，
[00:26:45.980] because there's a lot of like non-English being spoken at the table,
[00:26:45.980] 因为餐桌上有很多非英语语言在说，
[00:26:48.700] you're just like not eating.
[00:26:48.700] 你就像没吃饭一样。
[00:26:50.160] I feel like I've had times where I was like translating the whole time.
[00:26:50.160] 我感觉自己有时候就像一直在翻译一样。
[00:26:52.800] And then I look down, everyone's done with dinner.
[00:26:52.800] 然后我低头一看，大家都吃完晚饭了。
[00:26:54.580] And then I have like a full meal on my plate.
[00:26:54.580] 然后我的盘子里就摆着满满一盘食物了。
[00:26:58.620] So, you know, bless people like you who kind of step in to help.
[00:26:58.620] 所以，要感谢像你这样挺身而出提供帮助的人。
[00:27:03.660] I've been at dinners before where other people have had to translate for me.
[00:27:03.660] 我以前参加过一些晚宴，当时需要其他人为我翻译。
[00:27:07.000] And in that moment, I was like, oh my God, this is like a full-time job.
[00:27:07.000] 那一刻，我心想，我的天哪，这简直就像一份全职工作。
[00:27:11.340] Like I need two minute breaks between each translation to get a bite of food in.
[00:27:11.340] 就像我需要在每次翻译之间休息两分钟才能吃上一口东西一样。
[00:27:16.980] Then you're just like speed eating.
[00:27:16.980] 那你就像是在快速进食。
[00:27:20.080] I could truly appreciate any friend who has helped translate for me before at the dinner table.
[00:27:20.080] 我真心感谢任何一位曾在餐桌上帮我翻译的朋友。
[00:27:27.480] You're like, I'm just paying this forward.
[00:27:27.480] 你会想，我只是在传递这份爱心。
[00:27:29.600] Yeah.
[00:27:29.600] 是的。
[00:27:30.440] But you know, the language thing, I think can be a bigger issue sometimes too.
[00:27:30.440] 但是，你知道，语言问题，我认为有时也可能是一个更大的问题。
[00:27:35.920] It's honestly not so much like, oh, I can't understand what you're saying.
[00:27:35.920] 说实话，并不是那种“哦，我听不懂你在说什么”的情况。
[00:27:40.180] Because oftentimes there will be someone there helping to translate.
[00:27:40.180] 因为通常会有人在那里帮忙翻译。
[00:27:43.420] But sometimes it's kind of this thought of like, will this person ever know my parents' true personality?
[00:27:43.420] 但有时候我会想，这个人会了解我父母的真实性格吗？
[00:27:51.200] Like I don't know how to describe it.
[00:27:51.200] 我不知道该怎么形容。
[00:27:52.900] But it's just like when you're speaking your home language, like your mother tongue,
[00:27:52.900] 但这就像你说你的母语一样，
[00:27:57.480] you're just so much more comfortable and at ease.
[00:27:57.480] 你感觉自在多了。
[00:28:00.280] Versus if you're speaking a language that you learned when you were older,
[00:28:00.280] 但如果你说的语言是你长大后才学的，情况就完全不同了。
[00:28:03.080] you just might feel a little bit more insecure or like awkward.
[00:28:03.080] 你可能会感到有点不自信或尴尬。
[00:28:06.900] And I feel like those things kind of show in the language.
[00:28:06.900] 我觉得这些东西在语言中都有所体现。
[00:28:09.460] I will say that there are times where I'm just like, oh, you know,
[00:28:09.460] 我得说，有时候我就会想，哦，你知道的，
[00:28:12.300] it could be a completely different vibe if we were all speaking Korean or something like that.
[00:28:12.300] 如果我们都说韩语之类的语言，气氛可能会完全不同。
[00:28:16.840] Yeah, translation is hard.
[00:28:16.840] 是的，翻译很难。
[00:28:18.340] I guess the solution there is that someone has to learn the other language.
[00:28:18.340] 我想解决办法就是有人必须学习另一种语言。
[00:28:24.940] Dude, I know.
[00:28:24.940] 兄弟，我知道。
[00:28:26.000] But it's also just like the same issue swapped, right?
[00:28:26.000] 但这不就相当于同一个问题换了个方向吗？
[00:28:29.140] Right.
[00:28:29.140] 正确的。
[00:28:29.680] One party must put forth some effort or maybe both parties put forth the effort to try to learn the other language.
[00:28:29.680] 一方必须付出一些努力，或者双方都必须付出努力去学习对方的语言。
[00:28:38.180] And then they speak like Konglish or like Chinglish to each other.
[00:28:38.180] 然后他们就用韩式英语或者中式英语互相交谈。
[00:28:44.120] Exactly.
[00:28:44.120] 确切地。
[00:28:45.100] I do think this issue is something that gets more and more resolved,
[00:28:45.100] 我认为这个问题会越来越得到解决。
[00:28:49.140] like the longer time that you spend with someone.
[00:28:49.140] 比如你和某人相处的时间越长。
[00:28:52.340] I think I've shared these stories before on the podcast,
[00:28:52.340] 我想我之前在播客里分享过这些故事。
[00:28:55.220] but there are times where James is like speaking to my mom, who is not as fluent in English.
[00:28:55.220] 但有时候，詹姆斯说话就像在跟我妈妈说话一样，而我妈妈的英语并不流利。
[00:28:59.680] And they're just like having a moment and talking about very deep things without me there as a translator.
[00:28:59.680] 他们就像在享受片刻宁静，谈论着非常深刻的话题，而我作为翻译却不在场。
[00:29:05.100] And I think at a certain point, you see someone often enough,
[00:29:05.100] 我认为到了某个时候，你和某人见面太频繁了，
[00:29:08.560] you learn to understand their like communication patterns.
[00:29:08.560] 你会逐渐了解他们类似的沟通模式。
[00:29:11.040] And then you're just speaking to each other through your heart or something.
[00:29:11.040] 然后你们就通过心灵交流了。
[00:29:15.520] So I feel like this is more of like an early issue.
[00:29:15.520] 我觉得这更像是一个早期问题。
[00:29:18.220] Yeah.
[00:29:18.220] 是的。
[00:29:18.680] I'm just imagining walking by James and your mom and they're like speaking gibberish,
[00:29:18.680] 我脑补了一下你走过詹姆斯和你妈妈身边时，他们俩好像在说些什么胡言乱语的场景。
[00:29:23.280] but they totally understand each other.
[00:29:23.280] 但他们彼此完全理解。
[00:29:25.120] And you're like,
[00:29:25.120] 然后你就想，
[00:29:29.220] they've developed their own language.
[00:29:29.220] 他们发展出了自己的语言。
[00:29:31.460] Yeah.
[00:29:31.460] 是的。
[00:29:32.700] I'm like, what is going on?
[00:29:32.700] 我当时就想，这是怎么回事？
[00:29:34.100] What have I walked in on?
[00:29:34.100] 我这是撞见了什么？
[00:29:36.360] Okay.
[00:29:36.360] 好的。
[00:29:37.100] Well, how about beyond meeting your SO's parents?
[00:29:37.100] 除了见伴侣的父母之外，还有什么其他选择吗？
[00:29:41.680] What is it like to have your parents meet your SO's parents?
[00:29:41.680] 让你的父母见你伴侣的父母是什么感觉？
[00:29:49.380] I mean, to me, I feel like this is an event, you know,
[00:29:49.380] 我的意思是，对我来说，我觉得这是一件大事，你知道吗？
[00:29:53.540] like this is a big deal and it's very formal.
[00:29:53.540] 好像这是件大事，而且非常正式。
[00:29:57.200] And for myself and James, our parents first met each other during our college graduation,
[00:29:57.200] 至于我和詹姆斯，我们的父母是在我们大学毕业典礼上相识的。
[00:30:02.660] which at that time we had been dating for three and a half years or so.
[00:30:02.660] 当时我们已经交往了三年半左右。
[00:30:07.960] So it was like a decently serious time, I think.
[00:30:07.960] 所以我觉得那段时间相当严肃。
[00:30:12.160] And we organized a dinner at a steakhouse with both of our parents,
[00:30:12.160] 我们安排了一次和双方父母一起在牛排馆吃的晚餐。
[00:30:18.020] as well as James's grandparents.
[00:30:18.020] 以及詹姆斯的祖父母。
[00:30:20.300] I just remember thinking, wow,
[00:30:20.300] 我当时就想，哇，
[00:30:22.520] this is kind of like a pivotal moment in our relationship.
[00:30:22.520] 这算是我们关系中的一个转折点。
[00:30:25.580] Because in the past I had met his parents before and he had met my parents,
[00:30:25.580] 因为我以前见过他的父母，他也见过我的父母，
[00:30:30.380] but parents meeting each other, I don't even know how to describe it.
[00:30:30.380] 但是父母见面，我甚至不知道该如何形容。
[00:30:33.880] I feel like it's like the true test of is this going to work or not?
[00:30:33.880] 我觉得这就像是检验这件事是否真的能成功一样？
[00:30:36.600] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:36.600] 嗯。
[00:30:37.520] Did you prep your parents at all?
[00:30:37.520] 你事先跟父母说过话吗？
[00:30:40.180] I did.
[00:30:40.180] 我做了。
[00:30:41.080] I gave them kind of like a rundown of, okay,
[00:30:41.080] 我给他们大致概括了一下，好吧，
[00:30:44.540] this is like the background of James's parents.
[00:30:44.540] 这和詹姆斯父母的背景很像。
[00:30:46.660] This is his relationship with them.
[00:30:46.660] 这就是他与他们的关系。
[00:30:48.760] This is his relationship with his grandparents, things like that.
[00:30:48.760] 这是他与祖父母的关系，诸如此类的事情。
[00:30:51.740] Just so like there are more conversation pieces.
[00:30:51.740] 这样就有了更多可以聊的话题。
[00:30:55.380] Okay.
[00:30:55.380] 好的。
[00:30:56.020] That's interesting.
[00:30:56.020] 那很有意思。
[00:30:56.860] Because for some reason in my mind, I was like,
[00:30:56.860] 因为不知为何，我当时脑子里就想，
[00:31:00.280] I'll just let the parents duke it out.
[00:31:00.280] 我就让父母自己解决吧。
[00:31:02.360] If it works, it works.
[00:31:02.360] 如果有效，那就有效。
[00:31:05.120] I guess my situation is a little different though,
[00:31:05.120] 不过，我的情况似乎有点不同。
[00:31:08.100] because both sets of parents would share a common language.
[00:31:08.100] 因为双方父母会使用同一种语言。
[00:31:12.100] And I guess in my mind,
[00:31:12.100] 我想，在我心里，
[00:31:13.900] I just think they'll probably start communicating at a level that's beyond me.
[00:31:13.900] 我只是觉得他们可能会开始用我无法理解的方式交流。
[00:31:18.680] So there's nothing I can do.
[00:31:18.680] 所以我无能为力。
[00:31:21.820] I guess I think of it more as like feeding them Hail Marys if they run out of stuff to talk about.
[00:31:21.820] 我觉得这更像是，如果他们没话可说，就给他们喂些圣母经。
[00:31:28.080] You know, like post small talk, if the conversation dies,
[00:31:28.080] 你知道，就像闲聊之后，如果谈话就此结束，
[00:31:31.440] maybe my parents would be like,
[00:31:31.440] 也许我父母会这样想：
[00:31:32.700] oh, Jisoo mentioned that James's dad likes to do this.
[00:31:32.700] 哦，Jisoo提到James的爸爸喜欢这样做。
[00:31:36.280] So maybe when the conversation dies,
[00:31:36.280] 所以，也许当谈话结束时，
[00:31:38.280] the Hail Mary could be like,
[00:31:38.280] 圣母经可能就像这样：
[00:31:39.820] oh, Jisoo mentioned that you like to do this.
[00:31:39.820] 哦，Jisoo提到过你喜欢做这件事。
[00:31:42.160] I also like to do it too.
[00:31:42.160] 我也喜欢这样做。
[00:31:43.560] So then there's like some sort of,
[00:31:43.560] 所以然后就出现了某种……
[00:31:45.160] I don't know,
[00:31:45.160] 我不知道，
[00:31:46.180] hidden outline that they could run off of.
[00:31:46.180] 他们可以沿着隐藏的轮廓逃跑。
[00:31:48.880] But I think it also probably depends on your parents too, right?
[00:31:48.880] 但我认为这可能也取决于你的父母，对吧？
[00:31:52.480] Like, yeah,
[00:31:52.480] 是啊，
[00:31:53.140] I think I have parents who like to be briefed,
[00:31:53.140] 我觉得我的父母喜欢听取简报。
[00:31:55.720] but other parents like to just do things on the fly.
[00:31:55.720] 但有些家长喜欢随性而为。
[00:31:59.100] Yeah.
[00:31:59.100] 是的。
[00:31:59.660] And I think honestly,
[00:31:59.660] 老实说，我认为
[00:32:00.380] what you said makes a lot of sense.
[00:32:00.380] 你说的很有道理。
[00:32:01.860] Like you probably want to tell them at least a little bit of their background
[00:32:01.860] 你可能想至少跟他们简单介绍一下他们的背景。
[00:32:04.660] so that they have some starting point.
[00:32:04.660] 这样他们就有了起点。
[00:32:07.660] It would maybe even be a bit weird
[00:32:07.660] 这甚至可能会有点奇怪。
[00:32:09.640] that like you've met your SO's parents.
[00:32:09.640] 就像你已经见过你伴侣的父母一样。
[00:32:13.560] Your parents meet them.
[00:32:13.560] 你的父母会和他们见面。
[00:32:14.600] They just have nothing to say.
[00:32:14.600] 他们没什么可说的。
[00:32:15.900] They're like,
[00:32:15.900] 他们就像是：
[00:32:16.480] do not talk about us.
[00:32:16.480] 不要谈论我们。
[00:32:18.880] True, true.
[00:32:18.880] 没错，没错。
[00:32:20.000] And I feel like it truly could be very simple things like,
[00:32:20.000] 我觉得这可能真的是一些非常简单的事情，比如：
[00:32:23.600] oh, this person travels a lot
[00:32:23.600] 哦，这个人经常旅行。
[00:32:25.680] or this person just got back from vacation at X, Y, and Z
[00:32:25.680] 或者这个人刚从X、Y和Z度假回来
[00:32:29.120] or this family used to live in the city.
[00:32:29.120] 或者说，这个家庭以前住在城里。
[00:32:31.800] And then it's just like easy jumping off points.
[00:32:31.800] 然后，这就像是很容易的跳板。
[00:32:35.200] Yeah.
[00:32:35.200] 是的。
[00:32:35.680] I am curious about one thing.
[00:32:35.680] 我很好奇一件事。
[00:32:37.700] After your parents and James's parents met,
[00:32:37.700] 在你父母和詹姆斯的父母相识之后，
[00:32:40.540] have they ever like hung out after?
[00:32:40.540] 他们之后有没有一起出去玩过？
[00:32:45.440] I think it's a little hard
[00:32:45.440] 我觉得有点难
[00:32:46.960] because a bunch of our parents live out of state.
[00:32:46.960] 因为我们很多父母都住在外州。
[00:32:51.000] Right.
[00:32:51.000] 正确的。
[00:32:51.460] It's not as easy to get everyone in the same country,
[00:32:51.460] 要让所有人都待在同一个国家并不容易。
[00:32:55.360] let alone the same state,
[00:32:55.360] 更何况是同一个州
[00:32:56.740] and coordinate all those times.
[00:32:56.740] 并协调好所有时间。
[00:32:58.220] But if the timing does work out and everyone is in town,
[00:32:58.220] 但如果时间合适，而且大家都在城里，
[00:33:01.060] then we definitely do try to set up lunches or dinners.
[00:33:01.060] 那么我们肯定会尽量安排午餐或晚餐。
[00:33:03.900] And it's always pleasant.
[00:33:03.900] 而且总是令人愉快的。
[00:33:05.420] Everyone is just like very nice.
[00:33:05.420] 每个人都非常友善。
[00:33:06.600] So it's nice to kind of grab food and just chat and catch up.
[00:33:06.600] 所以，一起吃点东西，聊聊天，叙叙旧，感觉很不错。
[00:33:11.380] I'm just always curious.
[00:33:11.380] 我只是总是很好奇。
[00:33:12.820] Like, I wonder if there's any,
[00:33:12.820] 我想知道有没有这样的，
[00:33:14.620] and I'm sure there are,
[00:33:14.620] 我相信肯定有。
[00:33:15.600] but I wonder if there's any marriages
[00:33:15.600] 但我很好奇是否有人结婚。
[00:33:17.880] where the in-laws become like best buddies.
[00:33:17.880] 姻亲关系变得像最好的朋友一样。
[00:33:22.500] That's interesting because I don't know,
[00:33:22.500] 这很有意思，因为我不知道。
[00:33:24.880] I feel like the in-law thing is like a common trope in drama.
[00:33:24.880] 我觉得姻亲关系是戏剧中常见的桥段。
[00:33:29.860] Right.
[00:33:29.860] 正确的。
[00:33:30.560] And I'm very fortunate to have amazing in-laws.
[00:33:30.560] 我很幸运拥有很棒的公婆。
[00:33:33.460] And I think my parents are great too.
[00:33:33.460] 我觉得我的父母也很棒。
[00:33:35.720] But to get everyone to be like best friends is hard.
[00:33:35.720] 但要让每个人都像最好的朋友一样，是很难的。
[00:33:39.440] Yeah.
[00:33:39.440] 是的。
[00:33:40.180] It would have to be like a unique set of circumstances
[00:33:40.180] 这必须是一种非常特殊的境况。
[00:33:43.920] where everything works out.
[00:33:43.920] 一切都会好起来的。
[00:33:45.780] But I will say I have seen it on social media
[00:33:45.780] 但我确实在社交媒体上看到过。
[00:33:48.420] and in like my social circles.
[00:33:48.420] 在我的社交圈里也是如此。
[00:33:50.660] And it's always really cool to see that happen.
[00:33:50.660] 看到这种情况总是让人觉得很酷。
[00:33:53.160] I think it takes like every parent to be very extroverted
[00:33:53.160] 我觉得几乎所有父母都需要非常外向。
[00:33:56.320] and also like open for new friendships.
[00:33:56.320] 也乐于结交新朋友。
[00:33:59.040] I think the closest to that situation that I've seen
[00:33:59.040] 我认为我所见过的最接近这种情况的情况是
[00:34:03.260] is both sets of my grandparents.
[00:34:03.260] 是我的两对祖父母。
[00:34:05.620] They actually knew each other before my parents started dating
[00:34:05.620] 事实上，在我父母开始约会之前，他们就已经认识了。
[00:34:09.600] because they all were like professors
[00:34:09.600] 因为他们都像教授一样。
[00:34:12.640] at the same university or something.
[00:34:12.640] 在同一所大学或其他类似的地方。
[00:34:14.660] So when my mom and dad started dating,
[00:34:14.660] 所以，当我的父母开始约会的时候，
[00:34:17.080] my mom was just like,
[00:34:17.080] 我妈当时就那样说：
[00:34:18.660] oh, I'm dating this dude from school.
[00:34:18.660] 哦，我正在和学校里的一个男生约会。
[00:34:20.480] This is his name.
[00:34:20.480] 这是他的名字。
[00:34:21.940] Her parents were like,
[00:34:21.940] 她父母当时的反应是这样的：
[00:34:23.160] oh, like professor so-and-so's kid.
[00:34:23.160] 哦，就像某某教授的孩子一样。
[00:34:25.440] And she was like, yeah.
[00:34:25.440] 她回答说：“是啊。”
[00:34:26.600] And I was like, oh my God.
[00:34:26.600] 我当时就想，我的天哪。
[00:34:28.340] Like at that point,
[00:34:28.340] 就像那时一样，
[00:34:29.000] you don't even need your parents to meet.
[00:34:29.000] 你甚至不需要父母见面。
[00:34:31.540] They already know each other.
[00:34:31.540] 他们彼此已经认识了。
[00:34:33.100] Yeah.
[00:34:33.100] 是的。
[00:34:34.720] That's wild.
[00:34:34.720] 太不可思议了。
[00:34:36.160] That actually reminds me of the episode
[00:34:36.160] 这让我想起了那一集
[00:34:37.880] that we just did with Hannah
[00:34:37.880] 我们刚才和汉娜一起做的
[00:34:40.300] where we talked about her experience being a teacher
[00:34:40.300] 我们聊到了她当老师的经历。
[00:34:42.820] and like knowing what the student gossip is.
[00:34:42.820] 而且喜欢了解学生之间的八卦。
[00:34:45.260] Except the student gossip would be like your kid dating
[00:34:45.260] 只不过，学生之间的八卦就像你孩子谈恋爱一样。
[00:34:49.100] another teacher's kid.
[00:34:49.100] 另一位老师的孩子。
[00:34:50.940] I don't know how I would feel about that.
[00:34:50.940] 我不知道我会作何感想。
[00:34:53.120] I think if it were me and my kids,
[00:34:53.120] 我想如果是我和我的孩子们，
[00:34:55.120] I would kind of prefer them to be kids of people
[00:34:55.120] 我倒希望他们是人类的孩子。
[00:34:58.180] that I don't know
[00:34:58.180] 我不知道
[00:34:59.060] just so that there's no preconceptions
[00:34:59.060] 只是为了避免产生任何先入为主的观念。
[00:35:01.420] that I might have about the family
[00:35:01.420] 我可能对这个家庭有所了解
[00:35:03.000] or something like that.
[00:35:03.000] 或者类似的事情。
[00:35:04.220] But I will say the ideal situation
[00:35:04.220] 但我要说的是，理想的情况
[00:35:07.400] or maybe something that could be cool
[00:35:07.400] 或者也许是一些很酷的东西
[00:35:09.160] is if my kid started dating a friend's kids.
[00:35:09.160] 如果我的孩子开始和朋友的孩子约会呢？
[00:35:14.000] That would be pretty cool.
[00:35:14.000] 那真是太酷了。
[00:35:15.720] Okay.
[00:35:15.720] 好的。
[00:35:16.000] The funniest thing,
[00:35:16.000] 最搞笑的是，
[00:35:17.200] I don't know if your family friends
[00:35:17.200] 我不知道你的家人朋友是否认识你。
[00:35:19.040] ever did this growing up,
[00:35:19.040] 小时候做过这件事吗？
[00:35:20.320] but I feel like my family friends,
[00:35:20.320] 但我感觉我的家人朋友，
[00:35:22.700] the parents were like low-key shipping the kids.
[00:35:22.700] 父母们就像是在暗中撮合孩子。
[00:35:28.020] They're like,
[00:35:28.020] 他们就像是：
[00:35:28.760] oh my God,
[00:35:28.760] 我的天啊，
[00:35:29.220] wouldn't it be great
[00:35:29.220] 那岂不是很棒吗？
[00:35:29.820] if these two got together
[00:35:29.820] 如果这两个人在一起
[00:35:31.180] and those two got together?
[00:35:31.180] 他们俩在一起了？
[00:35:32.600] And they would like very,
[00:35:32.600] 他们非常希望如此。
[00:35:34.340] very gently like push it,
[00:35:34.340] 轻轻地推一下，
[00:35:36.300] but nothing too serious
[00:35:36.300] 但没什么大碍。
[00:35:37.720] because it was mostly just a joke,
[00:35:37.720] 因为这主要只是个玩笑，
[00:35:39.440] but it was definitely there.
[00:35:39.440] 但它确实存在。
[00:35:40.880] Like I remember hearing it.
[00:35:40.880] 我好像听过。
[00:35:42.100] I was like,
[00:35:42.100] 我当时想，
[00:35:42.440] the fuck?
[00:35:42.440] 什么鬼？
[00:35:43.020] They're just playing like make-believe over,
[00:35:43.020] 他们只是在玩过家家而已。
[00:35:44.940] like we're just their dollhouse or something.
[00:35:44.940] 就好像我们只是他们的娃娃屋之类的东西一样。
[00:35:47.760] Dude.
[00:35:47.760] 老兄。
[00:35:48.180] So I honestly didn't think
[00:35:48.180] 所以说实话，我真没想过
[00:35:49.940] this was a real thing that happened,
[00:35:49.940] 这是真实发生过的事情。
[00:35:51.380] but recently my mom was telling me the tea
[00:35:51.380] 但最近我妈妈跟我说起茶
[00:35:54.200] on some pairings that were shipped
[00:35:54.200] 一些已发货的配对
[00:35:57.100] within our like family friend cinematic universe.
[00:35:57.100] 在我们如同家人朋友般的电影宇宙中。
[00:36:02.600] I was gobsmacked to say the least.
[00:36:02.600] 我当时简直惊呆了。
[00:36:05.500] I was like,
[00:36:05.500] 我当时想，
[00:36:06.020] what?
[00:36:06.020] 什么？
[00:36:07.460] But I feel like that could be kind of fun,
[00:36:07.460] 但我感觉那可能会挺有意思的。
[00:36:09.400] but I don't know.
[00:36:09.400] 但我不知道。
[00:36:10.440] I think part of me is torn
[00:36:10.440] 我觉得我内心很矛盾。
[00:36:11.540] because maybe it's cleaner
[00:36:11.540] 因为它可能更干净。
[00:36:13.100] and more simple
[00:36:13.100] 更简单
[00:36:13.960] to have friendships be friendships
[00:36:13.960] 让友谊成为真正的友谊
[00:36:15.800] and then familial relationships
[00:36:15.800] 然后是家庭关系
[00:36:18.200] be a different thing.
[00:36:18.200] 会是另一回事。
[00:36:19.640] Yeah.
[00:36:19.640] 是的。
[00:36:19.900] So that you can enjoy both things separately
[00:36:19.900] 这样你就可以分别享受这两件事了。
[00:36:21.900] without having to like mix
[00:36:21.900] 无需像混合那样
[00:36:23.280] and confuse the lines
[00:36:23.280] 并混淆界限
[00:36:24.660] of what is expected.
[00:36:24.660] 符合预期。
[00:36:26.220] That's true.
[00:36:26.220] 这是真的。
[00:36:26.940] Like imagine your kid coming home one day
[00:36:26.940] 想象一下你的孩子有一天回家……
[00:36:29.000] and being like,
[00:36:29.000] 就像这样，
[00:36:30.420] oh my God,
[00:36:30.420] 我的天啊，
[00:36:31.220] that guy broke my heart,
[00:36:31.220] 那个人伤透了我的心。
[00:36:32.200] but that dude's parents
[00:36:32.200] 但那家伙的父母
[00:36:33.780] are literally like
[00:36:33.780] 简直就像
[00:36:34.780] some of your closest friends.
[00:36:34.780] 你的一些最亲密的朋友。
[00:36:36.520] And you're like,
[00:36:36.520] 然后你就想，

[00:36:36.880] 老兄，
[00:36:37.300] I need to have a talk with them.
[00:36:37.300] 我需要和他们谈谈。
[00:36:40.280] Yeah.
[00:36:40.280] 是的。
[00:36:40.940] And then it becomes complicated
[00:36:40.940] 然后事情就变得复杂了。
[00:36:42.220] because it's like,
[00:36:42.220] 因为这就好比，
[00:36:42.920] oh,
[00:36:42.920] 哦，
[00:36:43.960] your kid,
[00:36:43.960] 你的孩子，
[00:36:44.700] but to your friend,
[00:36:44.700] 但对你的朋友来说，
[00:36:45.820] their kid is the priority to them.
[00:36:45.820] 孩子是他们最优先考虑的事情。
[00:36:48.040] So then it's like,
[00:36:48.040] 所以，然后就变成了这样：
[00:36:48.620] how do you navigate those boundaries?
[00:36:48.620] 你如何应对这些界限？
[00:36:50.320] Like maybe it's just easier
[00:36:50.320] 或许只是更容易些吧。
[00:36:51.500] if you have like a polite
[00:36:51.500] 如果你有礼貌的话
[00:36:53.200] and cordial relationship
[00:36:53.200] 以及友好的关系
[00:36:54.840] with your kids' SO's parents
[00:36:54.840] 与你孩子伴侣的父母
[00:36:56.520] instead of having to do like the,
[00:36:56.520] 而不是像那样，
[00:36:58.900] are we friends
[00:36:58.900] 我们是朋友吗？
[00:36:59.540] or are we in-laws?
[00:36:59.540] 还是说我们是姻亲？
[00:37:01.940] Yeah.
[00:37:01.940] 是的。
[00:37:02.480] That's making a lot more sense.
[00:37:02.480] 这样就说得通了。
[00:37:04.400] It's just like less complicated.
[00:37:04.400] 它就没那么复杂了。
[00:37:06.480] You don't have to get too attached.
[00:37:06.480] 你不必投入太多感情。
[00:37:08.620] You don't have to like
[00:37:08.620] 你不必喜欢
[00:37:09.840] get pulled into sides.
[00:37:09.840] 被拉向两侧。
[00:37:11.620] You can just naturally stay
[00:37:11.620] 你自然而然就能留下来。
[00:37:13.320] on your kin's side.
[00:37:13.320] 你那边的亲戚。

[00:37:17.380] Just keep it easy.
[00:37:17.380] 简单点就好。
[00:37:18.560] So I guess this sounds like
[00:37:18.560] 所以我觉得这听起来像是
[00:37:20.180] if we were to have kids
[00:37:20.180] 如果我们要孩子的话
[00:37:22.020] getting married,
[00:37:22.020] 结婚

[00:37:23.300] 我们可能不会
[00:37:25.140] try to be best buds
[00:37:25.140] 努力成为最好的朋友
[00:37:26.800] with the other side's family.
[00:37:26.800] 与对方家人相处。
[00:37:29.580] If that makes sense.
[00:37:29.580] 如果这样说你能理解的话。
[00:37:30.900] It sounds,
[00:37:30.900] 听起来，
[00:37:31.540] it's so convoluted,
[00:37:31.540] 太复杂了，
[00:37:32.540] but.

[00:37:49.860] 然后随着时间的推移……
[00:37:51.360] and you're like,
[00:37:51.360] 然后你就想，
[00:37:51.880] oh yeah,
[00:37:51.880] 哦，是的。
[00:37:52.280] this is for sure.
[00:37:52.280] 这一点毋庸置疑。
[00:37:53.840] Then maybe it's easier
[00:37:53.840] 那或许就容易多了。
[00:37:54.920] to form a friendship then.
[00:37:54.920] 然后建立友谊。
[00:37:57.900] I don't know.
[00:37:57.900] 我不知道。
[00:37:58.800] Maybe it's the pessimist in me,
[00:37:58.800] 也许是我悲观的一面作祟吧。
[00:38:00.420] but I feel like
[00:38:00.420] 但我感觉
[00:38:01.300] I wouldn't want to be
[00:38:01.300] 我不想成为
[00:38:02.560] the reason that

[00:38:11.860] 或者发生了一些事
[00:38:12.880] and then the kid is like,

[00:38:51.260] 就像假设的那样，
[00:38:52.920] I do think that

[00:39:09.100] scurcuffle or whatever,
[00:39:09.100] 混乱或其他什么的，

[00:39:37.480] about parents' values.
[00:39:37.480] 关于父母的价值观。

[00:40:24.940] Because like you said,
[00:40:24.940] 因为就像你说的，
[00:40:26.140] it's so hard
