[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal and I'm Kate Welcome back Kate last time episode 216 meeting new people which was a fun episode and I feel like very Relevant, you know
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal，我是Kate。欢迎Kate回来！上一期节目是第216期，我们认识了新朋友，那期节目很有趣，我觉得也很有意义，你知道的。
[00:00:26.180] It's hard to meet new people at our age and I still often think back that episode actually what we talked about Whenever I like meeting new people But before we get to today's topic
[00:00:26.180] 在我们这个年纪，结识新朋友真的很难，我至今仍然经常回想起那次谈话的内容。其实，每当我想结识新朋友的时候，我都会想起那次谈话的内容。不过，在我们进入今天的话题之前……
[00:00:37.880] We do have a slang word to discuss and this one is kind of fun because it's kind of like an evolution of one of the previous words that we've talked about before and the previous phrase is Let them cook
[00:00:37.880] 我们今天要讨论一个俚语，这个俚语挺有意思的，因为它有点像是我们之前讨论过的一个词的演变，那个词是“Let them cook”。
[00:00:51.720] Today's word is cooked. And so in like a sentence, I guess it would be like Wow right now in the NBA Finals Mavs are so cooked So the meaning of cooked is basically like you're screwed you're not in a good place It's looking pretty doomed for you
[00:00:51.720] 今天的词是“cooked”。举个例子，比如“哇，现在NBA总决赛小牛队真是完蛋了”。“cooked”的意思基本上就是“你完蛋了，处境很糟糕，看起来你死定了”。
[00:01:13.660] Confused me because I'd only heard of like the word cook in slang terms being used as like, oh, let him cook Let them cook right? So it's like usually a good thing. Like this is something good that is about to happen
[00:01:13.660] 这让我很困惑，因为我之前只在俚语里听过“cook”这个词，比如“让他做饭”、“让他们做饭”之类的，对吧？所以它通常是件好事，预示着好事即将发生。
[00:01:24.940] So I actually hear like the positive version of that which is like bro really Cooked like he did this said cooking that we allowed him to do I actually haven't heard it used in like the oh like oh like he's cooked now
[00:01:24.940] 所以我听到的其实是褒义的说法，比如“兄弟，他真厉害，他做的菜真棒，我们允许他做的菜他都做了。” 我其实没听过用“哦，他现在真厉害”这种说法。
[00:01:41.460] Like this is a bad thing for this person It is so funny that it's like a dual meaning Almost exact opposite meanings like actually but how I've been seeing it often lately is Sort of like a way to roast yourself so on tik-tok sometimes on your feed
[00:01:41.460] 这对这个人来说好像是件坏事。这很有趣，因为它有双重含义，几乎是完全相反的意思。实际上，我最近经常看到的是，这有点像是在TikTok上自嘲，有时候会在你的动态里出现。
[00:01:58.220] There's like weird videos that come up right the comments will always be like, oh I'm cooked. I find this funny It's so over basically. So then I feel like that's like a really funny way of
[00:01:58.220] 有些视频突然冒出来，评论里总是会说“哦，我完蛋了”。我觉得这很搞笑，基本上就到此为止了。所以我觉得这是一种非常搞笑的方式……
[00:02:08.060] Joking about it, but I can totally see how it can be confusing because it can mean both things at the same time Yes, and I just have to use context clues. So whether this is a positive thing or a negative thing Yeah
[00:02:08.060] 开玩笑啦，但我完全能理解为什么会让人困惑，因为它可以同时表示两种意思。是的，我只能根据上下文来判断。所以，这到底是好事还是坏事呢？嗯。
[00:02:19.740] Yeah, I guess it is very heavily context based now in my mind when I think of cooked I kind of think of it attached to the previous like oh let them cook. Yeah kind of thing
[00:02:19.740] 是的，我觉得现在我对“熟”这个词的理解很大程度上取决于语境，在我看来，它通常会和之前的动作联系起来，比如“让他们煮熟吧”。嗯，就是这种感觉。
[00:02:31.500] So I think oh, it's like overcooked now. So that's why it's like done. It's over makes me think of the game overcooked Which is really fun I find it kind of funny too because
[00:02:31.500] 所以我觉得，哦，它现在好像煮过头了。所以它就完蛋了。完蛋让我想起了游戏《煮过头》（Overcooked），那游戏真的很好玩，我觉得也挺搞笑的，因为
[00:02:43.900] Cooked or like let him cook or even I'm cooked. I feel like is a slightly more Male leaning term it's not for the girls in the games Like it's more for like the dudes, you know who watch sports or play games or whatnot in a stereotypical sense
[00:02:43.900] 熟了，或者像“让他熟”或者“我熟了”之类的。我觉得这个词有点偏男性化，它不是用来形容游戏里的女生，而是用来形容那些看体育比赛、玩游戏之类的男生，那种刻板印象里的感觉。
[00:02:58.100] And I'm just like why are these guys making jokes about cooking because I feel like Women are the ones cooking. Oh my god. That's why it's slang right? Because it's a foreign new concept It's like newly introduced Oh my god
[00:02:58.100] 我当时就想，这些人为什么要拿做饭开玩笑？我觉得做饭的人才是女人啊。我的天哪。所以才成了俚语吧？因为这是个新概念，就像是刚引入的。我的天哪
[00:03:15.380] But that's such a good point because I feel like you're right when I think of this like slang term and the original one like let Them cook. I do mostly think of it in the context of sports and like games
[00:03:15.380] 但你说的很有道理，因为我觉得你说的对，当我想到这个俚语和它的原意，比如“让他们自己来”的时候，确实感觉很对。我主要是在体育和游戏的语境下想到它的。
[00:03:26.380] And that's where I see a lot of this kind of like specific slang and like tick-tock I see more of instead of saying like let them cook. It's like oh this person ate true
[00:03:26.380] 所以我经常看到这种特定的俚语，比如“滴答滴答”这种说法，而不是像“让他们做饭”那样。就好像在说“哦，这个人吃了真的”。
[00:03:36.660] Now when I do hear a lot from my co-worker, yeah, who's very young like fresh out of college Yeah, actually two areas of my life where I get my slang from are either from my co-worker who is young or from my now
[00:03:36.660] 现在，我经常从我的同事那里听到很多俚语，他很年轻，刚从大学毕业。实际上，我生活中的俚语来源有两个，一个是来自我这位年轻的同事，另一个是来自我现在的同事。
[00:03:49.540] Fiancee who actually like isn't it like eSports and everything? So streamers will always like introduce newest terms and then he'll start using it in his speech and I'll just be like what is that? But it's funny to see how this word I have
[00:03:49.540] 我未婚夫其实挺喜欢电竞的，对吧？主播们总是会介绍一些新词，然后他就开始在说话的时候用，我就只能一脸懵逼地问“这是什么？”。不过挺有意思的，我最近用的这个词……
[00:04:07.340] Seen used in both from my friend who is my co-worker and then also Brian who is using it more than like the negative term and my friend who's using more like the positive term Yeah, I feel like streamers and twitch. That's where a lot of
[00:04:07.340] 我的朋友（也是我的同事）和布莱恩都用过这个词，布莱恩用得比较多，但更多的是褒义的；而我的朋友用得比较多，但更多的是褒义的。是的，我觉得主播和Twitch平台就是个很好的例子。很多……
[00:04:21.780] interesting slang originates from Yeah, I can't think of any of the top of my head right now every time that gets introduced to me I'm like, I'm not following the thought process of like how you came to this term being what you're going to use
[00:04:21.780] 有趣的俚语起源于……是啊，我现在一时想不起来任何例子。每次有人跟我提起这个词，我都会想，我不太明白你是怎么想到用这个词的。
[00:04:36.060] Right. I feel like some of the more outrageous things come from streams and stuff I mean one that I can think of which we've often mentioned as you know, the biggest mystery slang is scooby-doo. Oh I've only ever heard it through streams and like gaming kind of stuff
[00:04:36.060] 没错。我觉得有些更离谱的说法都来自直播之类的东西。比如说，我们经常提到的一个，也是最神秘的俚语就是“史酷比”。哦，我只在直播和游戏之类的节目里听到过这个词。
[00:04:53.020] So that's just where I assume it originates from but I'm like, yeah, they always have the most outrageous slang dude Have you watched the video? I have not the scooby-doo toilet one. I have not it's cursed
[00:04:53.020] 所以我觉得它就是从那儿来的，不过我心想，是啊，他们总是用一些奇奇怪怪的俚语。你看过那个视频吗？我没看过，就是那个史酷比厕所的视频。我没看过，它太诡异了。
[00:05:07.060] It's just like a man's head in the toilet and like he moves erratically is what I've seen I'm like I've seen enough Interesting. Well, I think this one ranks pretty high in my opinion of slang
[00:05:07.060] 就像一个男人的头掉进马桶里，然后他动来动去，我看到的就是这样。我已经看够了。有意思。嗯，我觉得这个俚语在我心目中排名相当靠前。
[00:05:19.300] That's easy to use especially because you can use it on both ends of the spectrum But I guess slang words aside. Let's jump into our actual topic today, which is double dates I want to talk about success strategies for double dates whether we prefer them or not
[00:05:19.300] 这很容易上手，尤其因为它适用于各种场合。不过，俚语先放一边。让我们进入今天的主题——双人约会。我想谈谈双人约会的成功策略，无论我们是否喜欢这种方式。
[00:05:35.300] And just general things about going on a date with another couple So let's start with do you guys like double dates and why or why not? I Definitely love double dates for me
[00:05:35.300] 还有一些关于和另一对情侣约会的常规问题。首先，你们喜欢双人约会吗？为什么喜欢或不喜欢？我个人非常喜欢双人约会。
[00:05:48.340] It's more just like a fun way to hang out with my friends who happen to be coupled I guess it's just like just the nature of the activity that we're doing, right? so I hang out with my two good friends Daniel and Esther a lot with Brian and
[00:05:48.340] 这更像是和我的朋友们（他们碰巧都是情侣）一起玩的一种有趣方式，我想这大概就是我们所做活动的性质使然吧？所以我经常和我的两个好朋友丹尼尔和埃丝特，还有布莱恩一起玩。
[00:06:02.500] We'll do things like go on grocery runs. We'll eat out We'll play and do volleyball together, but it's more of a group activity with everyone else, but we'll watch movies Sometimes we'll just hang out each other's houses
[00:06:02.500] 我们会一起去超市买菜，会出去吃饭，会一起玩耍、打排球（不过这更像是一项集体活动），还会一起看电影，有时候也会在彼此家里聚会。
[00:06:14.340] So we hang out with them a lot in all different like areas are different types of activities that we do I wouldn't consider all of them double dates, right? so if it's something that I Perceive as an activity I would only do with Brian
[00:06:14.340] 所以我们经常和他们一起出去玩，去不同的地方，做各种各样的活动。我不会把所有的活动都算作双人约会，对吧？所以，如果我觉得某项活动我只会和布莱恩一起做，那它就属于双人约会。
[00:06:32.900] Then that would kind of just be like a double date Like if it's something more like a special occasion, but if it's something as simple as like doing chores
[00:06:32.900] 那就好像是双人约会一样，如果是像特殊场合那样，但如果是像做家务那样简单的事情，那就另当别论了。
[00:06:42.060] That's not a double date. Like sometimes we'll get groceries together because that's the majority of my experience with hanging out with another couple I don't feel as though it is a double date. Just like I'm hanging out with my friends who are also couples
[00:06:42.060] 那不算双人约会。比如有时候我们会一起去买菜，因为我跟其他情侣相处的大部分时间都是这样，所以我不觉得那是双人约会。就像我和我的朋友们（他们也是情侣）一起出去玩一样。
[00:06:56.900] So I guess for it to qualify as a double date in your mind it first and foremost has to qualify as a date Yes. Yeah, okay. I think that makes sense Meals are more often potential double dates. Yeah, so for meals
[00:06:56.900] 所以我觉得，在你看来，要算作双人约会，首先它必须得是一次约会。是的。嗯，好的。我觉得有道理。吃饭通常更容易算作双人约会。是的，所以吃饭的时候是这样。
[00:07:11.260] It's like if I'm just gonna go grab like some to-go and then we're gonna take it and eat it at our house And it's just the four of us and we're just watching some TV
[00:07:11.260] 就好像我去买点外卖，然后我们四个人带回家边看电视边吃。
[00:07:18.900] Like I would do that on a casual like weekday with Brian. That's not a date to me So therefore if I'm doing this with Daniel and Esther then it's also not a date
[00:07:18.900] 就像我平时工作日会和布莱恩一起做这件事一样。对我来说，那不算约会。所以，如果我和丹尼尔还有埃丝特一起做这件事，那也不算约会。
[00:07:27.980] but if we're eating a fancy meal and we're celebrating like their birthdays or we're doing something like oh Let's try that new fancy place and we get up and we get dressed up. I would consider that a date
[00:07:27.980] 但如果我们去吃一顿丰盛的大餐，比如庆祝他们的生日，或者我们去尝试一家新开的高档餐厅，然后我们盛装打扮，那我就会把这算作一次约会。
[00:07:40.220] Yeah, I think that distinction makes total sense to me too because there are things that you can do with your SO And it just feels so everyday and routine and then when you set out to go on a real date I think the mindset feels completely different
[00:07:40.220] 是的，我觉得这种区别完全说得通，因为有些事情你可以和你的伴侣一起做，感觉就像是日常琐事一样；但当你真正去约会的时候，我觉得心态就完全不一样了。
[00:07:55.340] It's not always just the clothes or like just the environment or the setting but it's like I wake up and I'm like, oh my god Like today we're going on a date and it feels so much more special
[00:07:55.340] 不仅仅是衣服、环境或氛围，而是像我醒来时突然意识到“天哪，今天我们要约会了”，感觉一切都变得格外特别。
[00:08:03.460] So it makes sense that that would translate into the double date realm as well Yeah, I guess I never really thought about what defines a double date versus not because you're right. I think now as More and more of our friends find partners
[00:08:03.460] 所以，这同样适用于双人约会领域，这很合理。是啊，我之前确实没怎么想过双人约会的定义，你说得对。我觉得现在，随着越来越多的朋友找到伴侣，双人约会的意义也越来越明确了。
[00:08:18.440] It's more common that we end up hanging out and it just happens that you know, everyone's SOs are there So I guess you know in those situations It's not necessarily like a double date or a triple date or whatever X amount of people
[00:08:18.440] 我们经常会一起出去玩，然后碰巧发现大家的另一半都在。所以，在这种情况下，它不一定是双人约会、三人约会或者其他什么多人约会。
[00:08:31.640] It's more just like oh we're hanging out and everyone's just here Yeah, and like having a double date is more like intentional. I would say Yeah, I guess the same way that you would define what constitutes a date with your significant other
[00:08:31.640] 更像是“哦，我们一起出去玩，大家都在这儿”。是啊，而双人约会更像是刻意安排的。我觉得，这跟你和另一半定义约会的方式差不多。
[00:08:48.120] The same type of logic I would apply to is that a date with the other couple as well? but it does get like confusing at times because I'll have friends who are couples and friends who are single too and
[00:08:48.120] 同样的逻辑我也可以用来判断，这算不算和另一对情侣约会？但有时候确实会让人困惑，因为我既有情侣朋友，也有单身朋友。
[00:09:00.840] Basically anytime that I hang out with like the only the friends who are coupled the single friends will be like Oh you guys are on a date It's like I don't feel like we are on a date like we're doing something very simple
[00:09:00.840] 基本上每次我和那些情侣朋友出去玩，单身朋友都会说：“哦，你们在约会啊。” 我感觉我们不像是在约会，我们只是在做一些很简单的事情。
[00:09:11.320] Like I wouldn't consider this a date with Ryan. Therefore. I wouldn't consider it a double date with my other couple of friends So I always thought that was interesting and they have told us before
[00:09:11.320] 比如，我不会把这当成和瑞恩的约会。因此，我也不会把这当成和另外几个朋友的双人约会。我一直觉得这很有意思，而且他们之前也跟我们说过。
[00:09:22.000] They're like, oh you guys are they're planning a triple date. They're planning a double date. Like we must not impede It's like no, it's totally fine. If you guys wanted to come that's that's okay
[00:09:22.000] 他们会说，哦，你们俩在计划三人约会。他们计划双人约会。好像我们不能打扰他们似的。但其实没关系，完全没问题。如果你们想来，那就来吧，没问题。
[00:09:32.680] You don't you guys don't have to feel like this is like a special occasion But I think because it is just like couples they feel as if they cannot impede It's probably their excuse so they don't feel like the you know X the wheel
[00:09:32.680] 你们不必把这当成什么特殊场合，但我觉得，因为他们就像普通情侣一样，觉得不能干涉。这大概是他们的借口，这样他们就不会觉得自己像个傻瓜。
[00:09:48.560] I do think like visually at least when I see two couples hanging out on Instagram stories or something I always process that as like, oh, that's a double date
[00:09:48.560] 我觉得至少在视觉上，当我在Instagram Stories之类的平台上看到两对情侣一起出去玩的时候，我总是会想，哦，那是双人约会。
[00:10:02.320] I think I'm guilty of that. Yeah, I think there's also we're kind of talking about how the boundaries can feel fuzzy Sometimes I feel like there's been many times where I'm hanging out with my friends and then halfway through I'm like, whoa Is this a double date? Oh
[00:10:02.320] 我觉得我也有这种毛病。是啊，我觉得我们也在讨论界限模糊的问题。有时候我觉得很多次我和朋友们一起玩，玩到一半我就会想，哇，这是双人约会吗？哦
[00:10:17.640] That's interesting. Would you consider like when when me and Brian come over to your place and we're playing board games Do you consider that a double date? So I actually didn't until we sat down to record this episode today and I was like, oh, oh my god
[00:10:17.640] 这很有意思。比如说，我和布莱恩去你家玩桌游的时候，你觉得这算双人约会吗？其实我之前没想过这个问题，直到今天我们坐下来录这期节目的时候，我才意识到，我的天哪！
[00:10:32.320] Recurring double date. I have always considered that No way Cuz I'm sure like juicy shares stuff with you and one of those being we play board games
[00:10:32.320] 反复的双人约会。我一直觉得不可能，因为我确信像Juicy这样的人会跟你分享一些东西，其中之一就是我们一起玩桌游。
[00:10:43.240] Yeah, I often that her place. You always thought that was like a double date. Yeah in my mind. I was like, oh, that's so cute They have like a scheduled double date Like a recurring double date as you as you come But then on the flip side
[00:10:43.240] 是啊，我经常去她家。你一直觉得那就像双人约会。是啊，我当时就想，哦，真可爱。他们好像有固定的双人约会，就像定期双人约会一样，你每次来都去。但另一方面……
[00:10:56.460] Crystal you and your boyfriend and us like we go out to play like golf sometimes and then grab a meal or something afterwards I don't think I ever considered that a double date until today as well
[00:10:56.460] Crystal，你和你男朋友还有我们，有时候会一起出去打高尔夫，然后吃点东西什么的。直到今天，我才意识到这算双人约会。
[00:11:08.760] Well, I think someone once said it's almost like we're on a double date golfing together and then after someone said that I was like Oh, I guess this is like a double date, huh? When you're in the hangout where there are two couples
[00:11:08.760] 嗯，我觉得有人曾经说过，这感觉就像我们俩一起打高尔夫，像是在进行双人约会。然后，在别人这么说之后，我就想，哦，看来这确实有点像双人约会，是吧？当你和两对情侣一起在同一个地方聚会的时候。
[00:11:22.920] You don't feel as if it is a double date because at that stage You feel like these are just three other friends of mine and we're all enjoying the same activity But then when you brought up that example of like anytime I perceive two other couples hanging out
[00:11:22.920] 你不会觉得这是双人约会，因为在那个阶段，你觉得这只是我的三个朋友，我们都在享受同样的活动。但当你提到那个例子，比如每当我看到另外两对情侣一起出去玩的时候……
[00:11:38.020] It's like that's immediately a double date. So it's like you don't feel like it and in my head I didn't feel like as if it is because I feel like when I think of the word double date immediately
[00:11:38.020] 感觉就像是马上就要变成双人约会了。所以你感觉不到，而且我当时也觉得不是，因为我觉得一想到“双人约会”这个词，我脑海里立刻浮现的就是这个画面。
[00:11:50.080] It's like there's a romantic element to it. But when I'm actually on those double dates I don't feel the romance It's just friendship. I'm like, it's just mention That's actually a really good point. Like our double dates supposed to be romantic cuz it's like
[00:11:50.080] 感觉好像有浪漫的成分。但当我真正参加双人约会时，我却感觉不到浪漫，只有友谊。我就觉得，这只是个比喻。这确实是个很好的观点。就像我们的双人约会本该很浪漫，因为……
[00:12:07.680] Realistically, it's just a bunch of friends right who happened to be like dating each other Hey when I'm at juicy's house playing clank, like I'm not thinking about romance Between the two couples. Yeah, there's no romance just like sportsmanship or Like
[00:12:07.680] 说实话，他们就是一群朋友，碰巧有点像情侣。嘿，当我在Juicy家玩Clank的时候，我根本没想过这两对情侣之间的浪漫关系。是啊，这里面没有浪漫，只有体育精神之类的。
[00:12:27.040] Now that I'm thinking about it, maybe double dates aren't necessarily supposed to be romantic Maybe they're just supposed to be fun. I think I kind of see it like it's not necessarily always romantic but it establishes an arena where
[00:12:27.040] 现在想想，或许双人约会并不一定非得浪漫，也许只是为了开心。我觉得它未必总是浪漫的，但它创造了一个可以……的氛围。
[00:12:41.520] Romance is allowed as in if you're hanging out with friends and it's like a mixed group or whatever I feel like PDA is kind of like oh, this is like a little much but I feel like in a double date setting
[00:12:41.520] 如果和朋友们一起出去玩，而且是男女混合的聚会，我觉得在公共场合亲密一下是可以的。但我觉得在双人约会这种场合就没问题了。
[00:12:53.040] It's slightly more okay because you're both couples and it's sort of like fair game Not that it's like find a makeout with your partner Your friends who are a couple hey watch this Like holding hands and stuff I feel like is more okay
[00:12:53.040] 稍微好一点，因为你们都是情侣，这算是比较公平的。当然，这并不是说要你和你的伴侣亲热，而是说你和你的情侣朋友“嘿，看这个”，比如牵手之类的，我觉得这样更合适。
[00:13:12.480] Yeah, I guess cuz like you establish like oh, these are two couples hanging out together So it has more of that we all know we're couples and we all know there might be some sort of potential PDA I like that definition me and Brian have never truly
[00:13:12.480] 是的，我想是因为你明确地表明，哦，这是两对情侣一起出去玩。所以它更侧重于那种“我们都知道我们是情侣，我们也都知道可能会有一些公开场合的亲密举动”的感觉。我喜欢这个定义。我和布莱恩从来没有真正……
[00:13:28.600] like very much PDA throughout the majority of our relationship and Honestly, we didn't even question it until our friend Daniel started dating Esther So Gisu do you remember we went to Hawaii like a little while back and it was me and Brian you and James and Daniel
[00:13:28.600] 就像我们恋爱期间大部分时间都经常公开秀恩爱一样，说实话，直到我们的朋友丹尼尔开始和埃丝特约会，我们才开始意识到这一点。所以吉苏，你还记得吗？不久前我们去了夏威夷，当时是我和布莱恩，你还有詹姆斯和丹尼尔。
[00:13:49.840] But it was like that was just like it felt like a friend's trip because we made it a friend's trip, right? We focused on the activities and the competitiveness and in the things that we were doing
[00:13:49.840] 但感觉就像是朋友间的旅行，因为我们把它当成了朋友间的旅行，对吧？我们专注于各种活动、竞争以及我们正在做的事情。
[00:14:00.680] we made bets like we make fun of each other like it was very much the way that we define friendship and We saw that and without the trip and so when Daniel started dating Esther after this trip she actually
[00:14:00.680] 我们打赌，我们互相取笑，这很符合我们对友谊的定义。我们看到了这一点，如果没有那次旅行，当丹尼尔在那次旅行之后开始和埃丝特约会时，她实际上
[00:14:13.680] talked to him later on because we had gone to like a restaurant and Brian and I were walking in front Daniel Esther walking behind and she noticed that me and Brian weren't holding hands
[00:14:13.680] 后来我和他聊了聊，因为我们去了一家餐厅，我和布莱恩走在前面，丹尼尔·埃丝特跟在后面，她注意到我和布莱恩没有牵手。
[00:14:24.800] So she asked him just like why don't Kate like weren't they dating for like eight years like at this point Like why aren't they holding hands? Like why aren't they like linking arms, you know? Why don't they call each other, babe?
[00:14:24.800] 所以她就问他，为什么凯特和凯特交往了八年了，到现在为止，他们为什么不牵手？为什么不挽着胳膊？为什么不互叫“宝贝”？
[00:14:36.880] We were just like, oh, I don't think about that when like What were in these settings and then yeah She is definitely somebody who is very comfortable with holding hands calling her significant other, babe
[00:14:36.880] 我们当时就想，哦，我平时不会想这些，在这种情况下我们做什么呢？然后，嗯，她绝对是那种很习惯牵手、称呼另一半为“宝贝”的人。
[00:14:50.620] She's very like she hugs like all her friends and she has made me more of a hugger as well from hanging out with her so I thought that was
[00:14:50.620] 她和她所有的朋友一样，都很喜欢拥抱，和她相处之后，我也变得更喜欢拥抱了，所以我认为……
[00:14:59.680] Interesting like the PDA is allowed but because I'm not used to it. I'm like, I know it's allowed but I'm still not But that's a good point cuz I think all three of us here are like not PDA
[00:14:59.680] 挺有意思的，虽然公开场合亲热是被允许的，但我还不习惯。我就想，我知道是允许的，但我还是不习惯。不过你说得对，因为我们三个好像都不太喜欢公开场合亲热。
[00:15:15.840] So I'm like I'm thinking about I'm like, yeah PDA is totally allowed in double dates but like me personally not engaging But That's what Jesus point is, right? Like you don't have to necessarily do it
[00:15:15.840] 所以我就想，嗯，在双人约会中公开秀恩爱完全没问题，但我个人不会这么做。但这就是耶稣的观点，对吧？你不一定非要这么做。
[00:15:29.520] It is just allowed and because it is a lot then that's what's part of making a double date. Yeah It's so funny too cuz for me personally I'm recalling like a very specific memory that I have
[00:15:29.520] 这是允许的，而且因为人数很多，所以这就是双人约会的一部分。是啊，这也很有趣，因为就我个人而言，我回忆起一段非常具体的记忆。
[00:15:42.840] Where I remember we were hanging out with some friends and then we ended up like splitting off and we're like walking to our cars whatever and then the group that was left was just like maybe two or three couples and
[00:15:42.840] 我记得当时我们和一些朋友一起玩，然后我们就分散开了，各自走向自己的车，最后剩下的可能只有两三对情侣了。
[00:15:53.880] Then the couple that was walking in front of us They were holding hands and then I was like, oh shit. Does that mean like me and James can hold hands? You know on our dates like away from our friends and stuff
[00:15:53.880] 然后我们前面那对情侣手牵着手，我就想，糟了。那是不是意味着我和詹姆斯也可以牵手了？你知道，就是那种约会的时候，不在朋友面前的时候。
[00:16:05.360] We're affectionate and we like hold hands and whatnot but around other people we definitely shy away from doing that But once I saw the other couple hold hands, I'm like, oh my god, it's fucking fair game, dude That's exactly what happened
[00:16:05.360] 我们平时很亲昵，喜欢牵手什么的，但在其他人面前我们肯定会比较害羞。但当我看到另一对情侣牵手的时候，我就想，我的天哪，这完全没问题啊！结果真的就是这样。
[00:16:18.240] Because she well actually the second part of that story was she's like, why don't you hold my hand So Daniel and Daniel's like dude, I don't know came by never hold hands
[00:16:18.240] 因为故事的第二部分其实是，她问丹尼尔：“你为什么不牵我的手？”丹尼尔说：“兄弟，我不知道，我们从来不牵手。”
[00:16:33.440] So she's like why would like to hold hands so now they hold hands and now me and Brian sometimes holding our hands more Especially when we're hanging out with them because once we see that it is like oh and like it's totally fine for us to do that
[00:16:33.440] 所以她就问，为什么我们要牵手？现在他们牵手了，我和布莱恩也经常牵手，尤其是在和他们一起玩的时候，因为一旦我们看到他们牵手，就会觉得，哦，我们这样做也完全没问题。
[00:16:45.960] We're like, okay, like we can do if we want to if we don't we don't Esther's got great sway. I know the leadership But dude, I don't think I've ever seen Jisoo and James You went to our wedding. Oh you guys held hands. Oh, I would hope so
[00:16:45.960] 我们当时就想，好吧，想做就做，不想做就不做。Esther 很有影响力。我知道领导层的情况。但是，老兄，我好像从来没见过 Jisoo 和 James。你参加了我们的婚礼。哦，你们牵手了。哦，我希望如此。
[00:17:03.920] I Like wait, are you sure you know? You stood next to each other. I'm not sure if hands were touching But I think you know double dates being Okay, this is gonna sound a little odd but double dates feeling like a safe space for couples to be affectionate
[00:17:03.920] 等等，你确定你知道吗？你们站在一起。我不确定你们的手有没有碰到，但我认为你知道双人约会的意义。好吧，这听起来可能有点奇怪，但双人约会感觉就像是情侣们可以自由表达爱意的安全空间。
[00:17:26.600] I think is very true But it also kind of enables like certain conversation topics or like vibes to also come up one example that I can think of is I feel like when you're on a double date you can kind of talk about
[00:17:26.600] 我觉得这很有道理。但它也确实能促成一些特定的谈话话题或氛围的出现。举个例子，我觉得在双人约会的时候，你们可以聊聊……
[00:17:39.800] Fights that you might have had or like, you know recent like couple struggles because you know, the other couple would get it. Mm-hmm Definitely. I think that's a very fun topic
[00:17:39.800] 你们之间可能有过争吵，或者像最近情侣之间遇到的那些小摩擦，因为你知道，其他情侣肯定能理解。嗯，确实如此。我觉得这真是一个很有意思的话题。
[00:17:50.320] But I'm also like a bit afraid to like bring it up too because I'm like I don't want to cause Issues with like this other couple But when you or James who have been like dating for as long as like me and Brian have I'm like
[00:17:50.320] 但我也有点害怕提起这件事，因为我不想给另一对情侣带来麻烦。但是当你或者詹姆斯和我还有布莱恩交往了这么久之后，我就觉得……
[00:18:05.080] I'm gonna ask away like, you know, I think it's easier to dive into Deeper topics like how do you resolve fights? You know when somebody is acting this way in your relationship How do you deal with that?
[00:18:05.080] 我打算问一些问题，比如，我觉得深入探讨一些更复杂的话题更容易些，比如如何解决争吵？你知道，当你们关系中的一方做出这种行为时，你们该如何应对？
[00:18:18.600] It's easier to ask and present those questions when I know that the other couples relationship has been Secure and like like you're married, you know Like there's no other like other status and then I'm like
[00:18:18.600] 如果我知道另一对情侣的关系很稳定，就像已经结婚一样，你知道，就像没有其他问题一样，那么我就更容易提出这些问题了。
[00:18:30.720] I'm not afraid to like ask these questions or present them to you like you're James But if it's somebody who's like just started date if my friend just started dating somebody else
[00:18:30.720] 我不怕问这些问题，也不怕像詹姆斯那样跟你讨论这些问题。但如果是像我朋友刚开始和别人约会那样的情况，我就不太清楚了。
[00:18:38.800] Then I'm probably not gonna ask those questions, right? I'm not gonna be like, oh doesn't it annoy you and Like I'm not trying to start a fight but I think what's a fun thing is like finding the
[00:18:38.800] 那我大概就不会问那些问题了，对吧？我不会说“哦，这难道不让你生气吗？”之类的，也不会说“我不是想挑起争端，但我认为有趣的事情在于找到……”
[00:18:55.240] similarities between the way I act in my relationship and in my friends, so I think a good example is me and Brian versus Jess and Jesse So there's a lot of similarities between my friend Jess and my and my friend Brian my fiance
[00:18:55.240] 我在恋爱关系中和与朋友相处时的行为方式有很多相似之处，所以我觉得我和布莱恩与杰西和杰西之间就是一个很好的例子。我的朋友杰西和我，还有我的未婚夫布莱恩之间有很多相似之处。
[00:19:12.120] they have a lot of like similar personality traits in the way that they deal with conflict and So I will see similarities between when Jess is like talking about her relationship issues. I can explain Jesse's side
[00:19:12.120] 他们在处理冲突的方式上有很多相似的性格特征，所以当杰西谈论她的感情问题时，我会看到一些相似之处。我可以解释杰西的立场。
[00:19:26.240] Because I have been on the side where like Brian is upset like Jess is upset in the same way So I think that's like an interesting topic It's like who in the relationship is more like this who in the relationship is more like that
[00:19:26.240] 因为我亲眼见过布莱恩和杰西以同样的方式难过，所以我觉得这是一个很有意思的话题，就像是，这段关系中谁更像这样，谁更像那样。
[00:19:39.720] I don't know if you guys have ever noticed that between like your couple friends you too Yeah, I think I definitely have and It's my specific
[00:19:39.720] 我不知道你们有没有注意到，比如你们的情侣朋友之间，你们也一样。嗯，我觉得我肯定注意到了，而且这是我特有的情况。
[00:19:49.300] favorite when there is that kind of gender swap that you mentioned where maybe I can relate more to the guy or you know, James can relate more to the girl because there's just something about advice coming from
[00:19:49.300] 我最喜欢你提到的那种性别互换的情况，也许我能更理解那个男生，或者你知道，詹姆斯能更理解那个女生，因为来自男生的建议总是有种特别的魔力。
[00:19:59.700] You know each gender that makes it hit a little bit differently Like it's either easier to understand if my girlfriend is telling me. Oh, I've been in your husband's shoes Like I understand what he means then it's like I think easier for me to process a little bit
[00:19:59.700] 你知道，不同性别的人说话感受会略有不同。比如，如果是我女朋友跟我说，我就更容易理解。“哦，我曾经也是你丈夫的同理心患者。” 我能理解他的意思，这样我就能更容易地消化他的话。
[00:20:13.920] It also just is like a very unique experience, right? Like being able to present your relationship struggles to like a jury of two people And not just like one friend. Like if I go to my one friend, I know she'll have my back
[00:20:13.920] 这确实是一种非常独特的体验，对吧？就像能够把你的感情问题呈交给两个陪审团成员，而不是只跟一个朋友倾诉。如果我去找我唯一的朋友，我知道她会支持我。
[00:20:27.600] She'll support me but with a couple you can get a little bit more nuanced maybe or different perspectives Yeah, I think regardless it's very interesting to hear about like other couples and how they are similar or like maybe even
[00:20:27.600] 她会支持我，但和另一对情侣交流，你可能会听到一些更细致入微的见解，或者不同的观点。是的，我觉得无论如何，听听其他情侣的故事，了解他们的相似之处，或者他们之间的差异，都很有意思。
[00:20:42.800] Extremely not similar to how like you operate with your significant other and then sometimes it like you can really tell during dates I guess like one thing that I always find kind of funny to notice is like who Sits down and immediately starts pouring the water for everyone
[00:20:42.800] 这跟你和另一半相处的方式截然不同，有时候约会的时候真的能感觉到。我觉得有一件事挺搞笑的，就是有些人一坐下就开始给大家倒水。
[00:21:00.480] Like Setting out the utensils and stuff like that. It's pretty interesting to observe these things as well as like discuss Yeah, there's also Speaking of like those small mannerisms when it comes to planning double dates
[00:21:00.480] 比如摆放餐具之类的。观察这些事情，以及讨论这些事情，都挺有意思的。对，说到计划双人约会时的一些小习惯，也挺有意思的。
[00:21:16.240] Like there's always the people who do more of the coordinating within a couple So actually amongst me and Brian Daniel Nester Brian and Nester actually talk to each other most mean Daniel just like chillin in the back
[00:21:16.240] 就像情侣之间总会有人更负责协调。实际上，我和布莱恩·丹尼尔·内斯特之间，布莱恩和内斯特经常聊天，而丹尼尔则喜欢在后面放松。
[00:21:27.160] They'll be like, oh what time are we going? Like what are you guys? When will we see you? Where do you want to eat? And then me and Daniel literally just like do the little reacts Haha
[00:21:27.160] 他们会问，哦，我们几点出发？你们是干嘛的？什么时候见面？想去哪儿吃饭？然后我和丹尼尔就真的会做出那种小表情，哈哈
[00:21:41.720] That's pretty much it cuz it's like whatever Esther is communicating to Brian Daniel's involved whatever Brian is communicating Esther Like I am involved. So it's fun to see like who in the relationship does that part two? Oh my god, that reminds me of like a super funny moment
[00:21:41.720] 差不多就是这样，因为埃丝特跟布莱恩·丹尼尔交流的内容，布莱恩跟埃丝特交流的内容，就像我一样，都包含在内。所以很有意思的是，看看这段关系中谁会参与第二部分？哦我的天，这让我想起一个超级搞笑的瞬间。
[00:21:58.680] So yeah Sometimes like me and my boyfriend hang out with Jisoo and James and then one time James and my boyfriend planned something for us and they were like texting each other and then we didn't know about this prior, right?
[00:21:58.680] 所以，有时候我和我男朋友会和Jisoo还有James一起出去玩，有一次James和我男朋友为我们策划了一件事，他们互相发短信，而我们事先对此一无所知，对吧？
[00:22:11.160] So like I think one time I saw James pop up on my boyfriend's phone and I was like you and James like text And then I think GC you said you had like the same thing happen on your end too and we were both hella confused
[00:22:11.160] 所以，我记得有一次我看到James出现在我男朋友的手机上，我就想，你和James发短信了？然后GC，我觉得你说你那边也发生了类似的事情，我们俩都懵了。
[00:22:26.200] Yeah, I was like why is crystals boyfriend like bed bar requesting you and he was like, oh like don't worry about it Don't worry Yeah, we were like that's weird cuz normally it's it's like me and Jisoo
[00:22:26.200] 对，我就问，为什么Crystal的男朋友会像在Bed Bar那样要求你，他就说，哦，别担心，别担心。我们当时就觉得很奇怪，因为通常都是我和Jisoo这样。
[00:22:41.960] But isn't that like kind of the goal of like hanging out with your other couples It's like at some point, you no longer see each other as like the other couple. It's like those two people are our friends
[00:22:41.960] 但和其他情侣一起出去玩，不就是为了达到某种目的吗？就像到了某个阶段，你们不再把彼此看作是“其他情侣”，而是把他们当成了自己的朋友。
[00:22:54.320] That's true. I think it's more because like we have a group chat. So we're like, why are you texting on the side? Whatever you are talking about should be able to
[00:22:54.320] 没错。我觉得主要是因为我们有个群聊。所以我们就会问，你干嘛在旁边发短信？不管你在聊什么，都应该能直接在群聊里聊。
[00:23:04.820] See that makes no sense. I think that was the more shocking part. We're like, oh you guys are texting like Individually on the side like outside Actually, that's a funny thing to like couples group chats I think last week or so
[00:23:04.820] 这根本说不通。我觉得这才是最令人震惊的地方。我们当时就想，哦，你们居然在外面单独发短信？说真的，情侣群聊这种事挺有意思的，我记得大概上周吧。
[00:23:19.420] I went to go watch James play volleyball and then Kate also goes to those volleyball sessions as well So I texted her I was like, oh my god, like are you going to the game tonight or whatever?
[00:23:19.420] 我去看詹姆斯打排球，凯特也去看排球训练，所以我给她发短信说，我的天哪，你今晚去看比赛吗？
[00:23:29.140] and then I was telling James like oh like I text Kate like I'm waiting for her response and then he was like Oh, I don't think you sent it and I was like what and he was like
[00:23:29.140] 然后我就跟詹姆斯说，我给凯特发了短信，等着她回复，然后他说，哦，我觉得你没发，我就问，什么？然后他就说……
[00:23:37.420] Oh, I didn't get a notification in the group chat. And I was like Do you think that I would? Is all my communication supposed to go through our group But yeah, I feel like those couple group chats are really easy to use because it's just like I
[00:23:37.420] 哦，我没收到群聊通知。我就想，你觉得我会收到吗？难道我所有的交流都必须通过群聊吗？不过，我觉得情侣群聊真的很容易用，因为它就像……
[00:23:57.300] Don't want to have to tell you and then go and tell it like your partner too It's just like everyone sees this But what's funny is I have the the two couples that hang out with the most are Daniel Nester and my friends Yes, and Jesse
[00:23:57.300] 我不想先跟你说，然后再跟你的伴侣说一遍。感觉大家都看得出来。但有趣的是，我最常一起玩的两对情侣是丹尼尔·内斯特和我的朋友，还有杰西。
[00:24:09.980] so we have one with the six of us and then I have group chats with just Daniel Nester or just with Jess and Jesse and then so sometimes me and Brian will like think of something like what movie to watch right and
[00:24:09.980] 所以我们有一个六个人的群聊，然后我还会和丹尼尔·内斯特或者杰西、杰西单独开群聊，有时候我和布莱恩会一起想看什么电影之类的。
[00:24:21.420] It'll be like a movie. We're like, okay, we want to watch inside up to And then we'll just be like who would enjoy this the most right so that we're just like which which group chat to
[00:24:21.420] 这就像看电影一样。我们会说，好吧，我们想看里面的内容，直到……然后我们就会想，谁最喜欢这个，所以我们就会去哪个群聊里讨论。
[00:24:33.380] He is like, how are we gonna plan out this movie date? Actually? Yeah, so have options exactly but then for the most part we just tend to lean towards the one where it's just like everyone involved because it's just like if You like to you will show up
[00:24:33.380] 他问，我们该怎么安排这次电影约会？其实？嗯，我们确实有很多选择，但大多数情况下，我们倾向于那种大家都参与的，因为这样一来，只要你想来，就会出现。
[00:24:48.580] If you don't want to watch that movie Movies are always like really easy one to invite people to because if somebody doesn't want to come you can just be like yeah They just don't like that movie You know
[00:24:48.580] 如果你不想看那部电影，电影其实很容易邀请别人去看，因为如果有人不想来，你可以直接说“嗯，他们就是不喜欢那部电影”，你知道的。
[00:24:59.860] Nobody takes offense and like you don't really feel the pressure of having to like keep up a conversation because it's a movie well, this is kind of crazy though because one of the recurring things we talked about on this podcast is
[00:24:59.860] 没人会觉得被冒犯，你也不会感到非得维持对话的压力，因为这是电影嘛。不过，这其实有点不可思议，因为我们在这个播客里反复讨论过的一个问题是……
[00:25:12.700] my theory about trios and how they can cause a little bit of friction and As we're talking about double dates and having like triple dates I feel like a group of three couples is actually a trio because the unit is the couple
[00:25:12.700] 我有个关于三人组合的理论，认为它们可能会引发一些摩擦。既然我们聊到了双人约会和三人约会，我觉得三对情侣组成一个三人组合实际上也算三人组，因为这个组合的核心是情侣。
[00:25:27.900] Yeah, yeah, so that's very interesting. Actually, that is very interesting I can see it being a little bit difficult to manage I guess the biggest struggle is the one that I just mentioned right like
[00:25:27.900] 是啊，是啊，这很有意思。确实很有意思，我能看出管理起来有点困难，我想最大的挑战就是我刚才提到的那一点，对吧？
[00:25:38.780] in within this activity who would enjoy this the most or sometimes it's just like I haven't spent as much time with This couple let me spend more time with this couple. I've been seeing this couple a lot recently
[00:25:38.780] 在这项活动中，谁会最享受呢？或者有时候，我感觉自己和这对夫妇相处的时间不够多。他们让我多花些时间和他们在一起。最近我经常见到这对夫妇。
[00:25:50.540] so it's just like trying to balance out the amount of time we spend with each of our friends because they're both Important to us and we don't want you to feel we don't want them to feel like we like you more Than you because that's not true, right?
[00:25:50.540] 所以，这就好比努力平衡我们和每个朋友相处的时间，因为他们对我们都很重要，我们不想让你觉得我们更喜欢你而不是他们，因为事实并非如此，对吧？
[00:26:05.020] So I guess that's like the most difficult part But for the most part all of them are really really understanding if they see we're hanging out with the other couple
[00:26:05.020] 所以我觉得这大概是最难的部分了。但大多数情况下，如果他们看到我们和另一对情侣在一起，他们都非常理解。
[00:26:13.540] Nobody has ever said anything. Nobody ever voiced anything and honestly, I've never asked but like you just you just I had just have this feeling That they're like pretty okay with it. Like I've never felt any sort of tension even unspoken
[00:26:13.540] 从来没有人说过什么。从来没有人表达过什么，说实话，我也从来没问过，但就像你说的，我总觉得他们好像挺乐意的。我从来没有感觉到任何紧张气氛，哪怕是无声的。
[00:26:27.740] To be fair. I do think like a trio of couples is a little less intense I guess because even if say like one part of the trio is quote-unquote left out. They still have each other Ah
[00:26:27.740] 平心而论，我觉得三对情侣的组合可能没那么紧张刺激，因为就算其中一对被“冷落”了，他们彼此之间还有对方。
[00:26:41.820] Right, so it's not like someone's like truly left out on their own, right? So question for you guys do you think that having a Big group date. So for example more than three couples, right? Say like four or five six couples or something like that
[00:26:41.820] 对，所以并不是说有人会被真正孤立无援，对吧？那么我想问问你们，你们觉得大型集体约会怎么样？比如说超过三对情侣，比如四五对，六对情侣之类的？
[00:26:57.540] Is that double dating on hard mode or do you think the more couples you add like the easier it gets? Whoa, hmm I actually don't think that we've ever specifically planned like just couples to hang out Yeah at that level of like amount
[00:26:57.540] 这是困难模式下的双人约会吗？还是说你觉得加入的情侣越多就越容易？哇，嗯，我其实觉得我们从来没有专门计划过只让情侣出去玩。是的，数量这么多。
[00:27:15.260] What's it the same if it's just gonna get to more than just three couples at that point? It's just like okay Everyone should just come to whatever this is as long as we're able to like accommodate them because some activities are like limited To
[00:27:15.260] 如果到时候来的情侣不止三对，那情况又会怎样呢？就好像，只要我们能安排好，大家都应该来参加，因为有些活动是有人数限制的。
[00:27:30.240] groups of four or groups of six like I feel like very rarely are there like activities that can accommodate like eight and more People but I would imagine that's like hard mode
[00:27:30.240] 我觉得像四人组或六人组这样的活动很少见，能容纳八人或更多人的活动应该算是高难度模式吧。
[00:27:40.600] Yeah, cuz just planning for that many people in itself is already really hard. Yeah, but I do think maybe another potential like hard mode of Double dating or even triple dating is like doing a trip together versus just like a hangout I imagine that is probably pretty difficult
[00:27:40.600] 是啊，光是安排这么多人的活动就已经很困难了。不过我觉得或许可以考虑增加一个难度更高的模式，比如双人约会甚至三人约会，就像一起旅行而不是普通的聚会。我想这应该会相当难吧。
[00:28:00.440] Dude, I've actually never gone on a trip with the two couples that I hang out with the most I don't know if the one I went to Hawaii with you Jisoo even counts
[00:28:00.440] 兄弟，我其实从来没跟最常一起玩的那两对情侣一起旅行过，我不知道跟你和智秀一起去夏威夷算不算。
[00:28:09.680] I think it doesn't cuz it was like strictly couple. It wasn't strictly. Yeah, right, but I know that Both of you have done it I got invited to one Recently, but I couldn't make it when I got invited. I was like, whoa
[00:28:09.680] 我觉得不算，因为那感觉就像是情侣间的聚会。其实不是。是啊，没错，但我知道你们俩都参加过。我最近也被邀请参加过一次，但我当时没能去。我当时就想，哇哦。
[00:28:25.520] This is like for sure a double date like a double travel date. Ah Yeah, but you didn't actually also to Hawaii. No, I couldn't go cuz I was like, oh shoot that month I'm gonna be busy at work, but I feel like it definitely felt very official
[00:28:25.520] 这绝对是一次双人约会，就像双人旅行约会一样。啊，对，但你实际上并没有去夏威夷。不，我去不了，因为我当时想，哎呀，那个月我工作很忙，但我感觉这次约会确实很正式。
[00:28:40.920] You know the other couple was already gonna go on this trip and they're like Oh by the way, like you two should join us and I was like, whoa, this is the real deal I have also never done like a truly
[00:28:40.920] 你知道，另一对情侣本来就打算去旅行，他们突然说：“哦，对了，你们俩也应该加入我们。” 我当时就想，哇，这可是真的，我以前也从来没真正体验过这种旅行。
[00:28:54.680] Purely couples trip actually now that I'm thinking about it. I find it a little bit intimidating Because I feel like when you're going on a trip with just your so or like a trip with your group of friends Like these are things that I've experienced before
[00:28:54.680] 仔细想想，其实我更倾向于情侣旅行。但我觉得有点紧张，因为感觉和伴侣单独旅行，或者和一群朋友一起旅行，这些我都经历过。
[00:29:08.600] So I know what kind of behaviors or like what kind of mindset makes a trip like that more successful And there's like routines right like how you travel with your so and stuff
[00:29:08.600] 所以我知道什么样的行为或者心态会让这样的旅行更成功。还有一些惯例，比如你和伴侣一起旅行的方式等等。
[00:29:17.720] But I feel like going on a trip with another couple is almost like the halfway point so I'm like oh do I act like I'm going on a friend group trip or do I act like I'm going on a trip with my so and like what is the
[00:29:17.720] 但我感觉和另一对情侣一起旅行就像是折中方案，所以我就在想，哦，我应该表现得像和朋友一起旅行，还是应该表现得像和我的伴侣一起旅行，到底该怎么做呢？
[00:29:29.680] balanced midpoint Also, like what happens does everyone just like separate and do their own thing? Yeah at night and like Is there like limited? Interaction or is it like you hang out together?
[00:29:29.680] 平衡的中间点。另外，晚上大家是不是都各自散开，做自己的事情？晚上互动少吗？还是会聚在一起？
[00:29:44.040] Most of the time or do you like do romantic things together as like two couples, you know So me and Brian have wanted to do like a trip with our friends Daniel and Esther for a while now
[00:29:44.040] 大多数时候，或者说你们喜欢像两对情侣一样一起做一些浪漫的事情吗？你知道，我和布莱恩一直想和我们的朋友丹尼尔和埃丝特一起旅行。
[00:29:55.520] And it is like slowly leaving the top. Let's do this. Let's go on this trip stages It's like more we've looked at like flights. We've looked at dates now, so it's slowly exiting the chat
[00:29:55.520] 就像慢慢离开顶端一样。我们开始吧。让我们开始这段旅程的各个阶段。就像我们查看了更多内容，比如航班。我们现在查看了日期，所以它正慢慢退出聊天室。
[00:30:08.080] So we're hoping that we're gonna be able to do this but then I was thinking about this with Brian it's like precisely like what are we gonna do because Even as couples like that you each unit has their own separate interests
[00:30:08.080] 所以我们希望能够做到这一点，但我跟布莱恩讨论过这个问题，我们到底该怎么做，因为即使是像我们这样的夫妻，每个人也有自己不同的兴趣爱好。
[00:30:21.800] I think Daniel and Esther would probably enjoy a little bit more of like nightlife Whereas me and Brian like we don't we don't drink. I don't stay up late He is able to but like he also does not prefer to so we are also thinking about like
[00:30:21.800] 我觉得丹尼尔和埃丝特可能更喜欢夜生活，而我和布莱恩都不喝酒。我不熬夜，他虽然能熬夜，但也不喜欢，所以我们也在考虑……
[00:30:34.800] There are days where we should have like free days if like we're going to go on this trip Like there is a day like we collectively choose to do the things that would not interest the other couple And then we also thought about instead of having free days
[00:30:34.800] 有些日子我们应该安排自由活动日，比如如果我们要去旅行的话。比如，我们可以一起安排一天，做一些其他情侣不感兴趣的事情。然后我们也考虑过，与其安排自由活动日，不如另辟蹊径。
[00:30:47.720] Like maybe we could also compromise a little bit like we don't have to do a full night of nightlife, right? Going to bars maybe but we could have like a few drinks here or there
[00:30:47.720] 或许我们可以稍微妥协一下，比如不必整晚都泡在夜店里，对吧？可以去酒吧，但可以偶尔喝几杯。
[00:30:57.080] So that was like things that we had to consider too, but not to the full extent as it's not Like the trip is not there's no dates. There's no flights yet. I Think that makes sense
[00:30:57.080] 所以这些也是我们需要考虑的因素，但并没有考虑得那么全面，因为这次旅行还没有确定日期，也没有航班。我觉得这样说得通。
[00:31:08.760] So there's like some compromise and giving at least maybe half a day to a full day for each couple to just enjoy The trip on their own to yeah for coming back together. Yeah, it's a pretty good strategy. Yes
[00:31:08.760] 所以，这就形成了一种折衷方案，至少给每对情侣半天到一天的时间让他们各自享受旅程，然后再一起回来。是的，这确实是个不错的策略。
[00:31:21.000] But have not gone on one. I'm looking forward to it. I'll let you know how it goes Yeah, come back and give us the I Know my friends have gone on one that one was a little bit awkward
[00:31:21.000] 但我还没参加过。我很期待。回来后我会告诉你结果如何。嗯，回来后记得告诉我们。我知道我的朋友们参加过，那次有点尴尬。
[00:31:37.120] Because the trip was planned for three couples and one of the couples had broken up Oh, no but then they both went on the trip and so when the two couples that were still together like went off and did I
[00:31:37.120] 因为这次旅行原本是为三对情侣计划的，其中一对情侣分手了。哦，不，但他们俩还是去了，所以当剩下的两对情侣出发的时候，我……
[00:31:51.880] Think they actually did a free day where like they went on like, okay, let's have a nice dinner here The second couple was like, okay. We want instead of going a nice dinner
[00:31:51.880] 我觉得他们那天安排了自由活动日，就像是，好吧，我们去吃顿好的晚餐吧。第二对夫妇则说，好吧，我们不想去吃顿好的晚餐。
[00:32:00.120] We want to go do another thing and the couple that had split up had stayed behind and then they were just like talks Anyways, it can be but yeah, that's precisely why it's like considered hard mode, right? because there's nothing that you can really do if
[00:32:00.120] 我们想去做另一件事，那对分手的夫妇留了下来，然后他们就开始聊天。总之，有可能，但正因如此，它才被认为是困难模式，对吧？因为如果……你真的无能为力。
[00:32:17.880] Like the other couple is experiencing some sort of hardship whether they are breaking up whether they are currently in a fight whether You don't know what the situation is, but when they're experiencing like something difficult
[00:32:17.880] 就像另一对情侣正在经历某种困难一样，不管他们是分手了，还是正在吵架，或者你不知道具体情况，但当他们遇到困难时，你会感到很沮丧。
[00:32:31.400] That's not your place to say something. It's never your place to comment on somebody else's relationship Unless you were asked to it could be a bit awkward It can be very difficult to navigate being like, okay. What are we supposed to do now?
[00:32:31.400] 你没资格插手别人的事。除非别人问你，否则你永远没资格评论别人的感情生活，那样会很尴尬。你会很难把握分寸，不知道接下来该怎么办。
[00:32:45.000] Cuz the plan was to have fun Right Also as you're saying this though, I'm starting to think when you take a trip with you know other couples It's kind of like a trip where you're allowed to
[00:32:45.000] 因为计划就是玩得开心，对吧？不过，你这么一说，我开始觉得，和别的情侣一起旅行，有点像是被允许……
[00:32:59.520] Leave the main group for a bit with your you know with your unit to like do whatever you want to I think it's like It's easier to split up in like a double date or triple date situation on a trip where you're like
[00:32:59.520] 暂时离开大部队，和你的小伙伴们一起做你想做的任何事。我觉得这样更容易，就像在旅行中安排双人或三人约会一样。
[00:33:11.680] Oh like me and my so I want to go do this We'll meet back with you guys in a couple hours versus like imagine a friend group and then one person is like I'm gonna run off and Everyone would probably be like wait. No, like we'll all join
[00:33:11.680] 哦，就像我和我的朋友一样，我想去办这件事。我们几个小时后再和你们碰面。想象一下，一群朋友中，有一个人突然说“我要走了”，其他人可能会说“等等，不行，我们都要加入”。
[00:33:25.160] Like, you know, we'd prefer it if you didn't run off on your own It's also really easy within I guess like the pros of being on like a double date or a double Couple trip travel date is that when you are splitting up even if it's the activity
[00:33:25.160] 你知道，我们当然希望你不要独自离开。我觉得双人约会或者情侣旅行的好处之一就是，即使你们分开活动，也能各自享受乐趣。
[00:33:39.800] It's like the booth like how are we going to sit? It's really easy to just be like, okay, obviously we will sit like with our partners or it could be even fun to just if
[00:33:39.800] 就像在包厢里一样，我们该怎么坐？很容易就想，好吧，显然我们会和伴侣坐在一起，或者甚至如果……也挺有意思的。
[00:33:50.440] It's a activity where you can make it competitive like say you're going to mini golf, right? It could be like it will in heteronormative relationships It could be like boys versus girls or like we're gonna team up and it could just be like really fun because it
[00:33:50.440] 这是一种可以变得具有竞争性的活动，比如去玩迷你高尔夫，对吧？它可能就像异性恋关系中那样，可以是男生对女生，也可以是组队，总之会非常有趣，因为它……
[00:34:04.880] Supposedly at in every couple date whether it's always a set of two, right? So it's really easy to split the things evenly and I always think that's really fun because I think things that are like Competitive in nature of really fun
[00:34:04.880] 据说每对情侣约会都是两个人一起进行的，对吧？所以很容易平分事情，我一直觉得这样很有趣，因为我觉得像竞争性质的事情真的很有趣。
[00:34:19.280] Speaking of that though. I also think double dates are really good to get to know someone's new partner So like, you know in the mini golf example You said if you did like a you know girls versus boys
[00:34:19.280] 说到这个，我觉得双人约会对于了解对方的新伴侣也很有帮助。就像你举的迷你高尔夫例子，你说如果安排女生组队和男生组队，效果会更好。
[00:34:30.280] Then it's easy for you to like get to know the other girl better If like she's the new person in the friend group or The guy gets a chance to get to know the other guy better if he's like the new so and so I feel like
[00:34:30.280] 这样一来，如果对方是朋友圈里的新人，你就很容易更好地了解她；或者，如果对方是新来的某某，那男生也有机会更好地了解他。我觉得
[00:34:45.200] Kind of going back to what we talked about like being intentional with double dates Think like my most intentional double dates have been when there's like a new So and then either I'm the one getting
[00:34:45.200] 有点像我们之前聊的，比如要用心安排双人约会。我觉得我最用心安排的双人约会都是在认识新朋友的时候，然后要么是我主动，要么是我主动。
[00:34:58.360] Introduced to like other people or there's another new so that's being introduced to like us yeah, I think doing like the gender thing where you do girls versus guys or something is always really really easy because
[00:34:58.360] 就像介绍其他人一样，或者还有其他新事物，所以就像介绍我们一样，我觉得做性别对比之类的事情，比如女孩和男孩的对比之类的，总是非常非常容易，因为
[00:35:11.960] Everyone there is by default like closest to their so so then the main Objective of all four people there is to like get closer to the other person's so we're like You know get close to the other person essentially
[00:35:11.960] 每个人默认都和自己的亲近程度差不多，所以这四个人的主要目标就是尽可能地接近其他人，所以我们基本上就是想方设法接近对方。
[00:35:24.440] So then I think having that shared objective makes it really good vibes It's like we're all just trying to get to know each other better or likes get even closer and etc So I feel like it always brings really good energy up
[00:35:24.440] 所以我觉得，有了共同的目标，气氛就会特别好。感觉我们都在努力更好地了解彼此，或者说，想让彼此的关系更亲密等等。所以我觉得这总是能带来非常好的能量。
[00:35:38.200] Getting to know your friends new significant other hasn't really happened for me What about like Esther and DZ oh The one example I've been using this entire episode Just forgot with Daniel because like we hadn't known him for so long
[00:35:38.200] 我还没怎么接触过朋友的新伴侣呢。比如Esther和DZ那对？哦，我这集一直在举的例子，结果忘了Daniel，因为我们认识他时间不长。
[00:36:01.360] Long Esther was just like a huge welcome surprise she got along with Brian and I really well and in different ways too because she games and like Brian does not talk about Things that are not like gaming or anything And she's very inclusive too
[00:36:01.360] 埃丝特的出现简直是个巨大的惊喜，她和布莱恩还有我相处得都非常好，而且相处方式也很特别，因为她喜欢玩游戏，而布莱恩就很少谈论游戏以外的事情。她也很有包容心。
[00:36:23.240] So like they got along really well and the things that I would think that brought her and easy together the things that they bonded over are Similar interests similar hobbies same sense of humor because they clicked so well
[00:36:23.240] 所以她们相处得非常融洽，我认为让她们如此迅速地走到一起的原因，也是她们建立起深厚感情的纽带，是相似的兴趣爱好和相同的幽默感，因为她们非常合拍。
[00:36:36.840] I would say like as friends before as partners that made it out so much easier For me and Brian to get close to her too because like the way that we are close to Daniel It's the same that way that we are close to her now
[00:36:36.840] 我觉得，就像我们以前是朋友，后来又成了合作伙伴一样，这让我和布莱恩更容易接近她，因为就像我们和丹尼尔关系亲密一样，我们现在和她也很亲近。
[00:36:51.120] and it was also just really nice for me to just be able to have somebody who Was able to be as much of a friend to me as She is to Brian and like that
[00:36:51.120] 对我来说，能有这样一位既像对待布莱恩一样对待我的朋友，真的非常美好。
[00:37:03.280] I really really value like Jisoo like I think that's true for you as well. And I think that's really important to me But meeting her for the first time right? It was really easy with Esther because she is so open She wants to get to know you more
[00:37:03.280] 我真的非常非常珍惜Jisoo，我想你也是这么觉得的。我觉得这对我来说真的很重要。但是第一次见到她，对吧？和Esther见面真的很容易，因为她很开朗，她很想多了解你。
[00:37:18.920] So I felt like I didn't have to put in as much as of an effort Because of that it felt very effortless because this person wants to get to know us so That is my only experience. Do you guys feel when your friend has a new partner?
[00:37:18.920] 所以我觉得我不用付出太多努力，因为一切都很轻松，因为这个人想了解我们。这就是我唯一的经历。你们在朋友有了新伴侣时会有这种感觉吗？
[00:37:33.720] that they actually Put in more effort to get to know you more because they're just like I need to make a good first impression on my new Significant others friends. I think for the most part
[00:37:33.720] 他们实际上会花更多精力去了解你，因为他们会想着“我需要给新伴侣的朋友们留下好印象”。我觉得大多数情况下都是这样。
[00:37:46.960] yes, and there's like an added layer where it's like I am probably super close with my friend and Love that friend dearly and then that friend loves her partner or his partner
[00:37:46.960] 是的，还有一层额外的含义，那就是我和我的朋友关系非常亲密，我非常爱她，而她也深爱着她的伴侣。
[00:37:59.300] So then by proxy like we're probably somewhat similar ish people and will naturally get along since like people attract like people But I think also that's not always the case even though that is the ideal situation
[00:37:59.300] 所以，从某种意义上说，我们可能都是比较相似的人，自然会相处融洽，因为物以类聚，人以群分。但我认为，即使这是理想情况，也并非总是如此。
[00:38:11.280] Like there are times where maybe your friends new SO is someone that you don't really click with off the bat But I think either way like at least
[00:38:11.280] 有时候，你朋友的新伴侣可能和你一开始不太合得来。但我觉得无论如何，至少……
[00:38:20.200] Getting to know them in a double date setting is significantly easier than meeting them like in a big group setting or like at a bigger Party or something like that. So even if we don't always like click naturally or like immediately
[00:38:20.200] 在双人约会中了解彼此要比在大型聚会或派对等场合认识彼此容易得多。所以即使我们并非总能一见如故或立刻产生好感。
[00:38:32.440] I feel like I always at least appreciate like that double date setting so that I could actually just like get to know that So I feel like also another interesting Angle, so for someone like me where me and my boyfriend's friend groups aren't as like connected
[00:38:32.440] 我觉得我总是很欣赏那种双人约会的形式，这样我才能真正了解对方。我觉得这还有一个有趣的角度，那就是对于像我这样和我男朋友的朋友圈联系不太紧密的人来说。
[00:38:48.940] Sometimes I feel like if say like one of my boyfriend's close friends gets a new significant other and they want him to meet her But then it's like oh, I can't just invite him like by himself
[00:38:48.940] 有时候我觉得，比如说，我男朋友的一个好朋友有了新的伴侣，他们想让他见见她。但那样的话，我又会想，哎，我不能单独邀请他去。
[00:39:00.540] Like he obviously has a girlfriend too. So then it turns into a double date, you know And then I'm like there to meet that person too. But I mean not to say that
[00:39:00.540] 他显然也有女朋友。所以就变成了双人约会，你知道的。然后我也去见见他女朋友。但我并不是说……
[00:39:09.940] Originally, they're like no crystal doesn't need to meet this person, but it's just like it's an interesting Situation versus like two people already being extremely close with the third friend and then meeting the significant other
[00:39:09.940] 最初，他们觉得水晶不需要和这个人见面，但这就像是两个人已经和第三个朋友关系非常亲密，然后又遇到了对方的另一半，这种情况很有意思。
[00:39:22.420] I think it's interesting you guys think that double dates are a great way to like meet the other significant other for me I feel like it's always high stakes Okay, cuz I'm always just like the new partner if
[00:39:22.420] 我觉得很有意思，你们觉得双人约会是认识另一半的好方法。对我来说，感觉总是有点冒险，因为我总是扮演着新伴侣的角色。
[00:39:35.540] They're trying to like make a good first impression on their significant others friends But for me when I'm like meeting my friends new significant other I'm like, okay I need to like for the sake of my friend
[00:39:35.540] 他们想给伴侣的朋友留下好印象，但对我来说，当我见朋友的新伴侣时，我会想，好吧，为了朋友，我得表现得体一些。
[00:39:45.140] I need to be like not weird like I don't want the new person to be like, what did I get into? Who am I actually dating? I'm careful of making like jokes that like only makes sense to me and my friend
[00:39:45.140] 我不想表现得太奇怪，我不想让新认识的人觉得我这是招惹了什么人？我到底在和谁约会？所以我很注意不去开那些只有我和朋友才懂的玩笑。
[00:39:57.240] So, I don't think it's it's the most Comfortable situation I think but that's just based on my experiences I think that definitely dependent upon your relationship with your friend and then also the type of person that they tend to fall for
[00:39:57.240] 所以，我觉得这并不是最舒服的情况，但这只是基于我的经验。我认为这肯定取决于你和朋友的关系，以及他们容易喜欢哪种类型的人。
[00:40:14.880] Yeah, I think I can see what you mean. Like sometimes it's less Whelming to me in a bigger group of people, but sometimes it is also More manageable just meeting this one person slash two people. It's easier with some people
[00:40:14.880] 是的，我想我明白你的意思了。有时候，人多的时候我反而感觉没那么紧张，但有时候，只跟一两个人见面反而更容易应付。跟某些人相处更容易些。
[00:40:30.680] it's more difficult with some people and I feel like if you are the person introducing your new significant other to your friends then Choosing how you want to introduce your friend whether that is in a small group setting with like another couple or whether that's like
[00:40:30.680] 对某些人来说，这更难一些。我觉得，如果你要把新婚伴侣介绍给朋友们，那么选择如何介绍就很重要，无论是和另一对情侣一起在小团体里介绍，还是在更正式的场合。
[00:40:45.200] Bringing your new significant other to your entire friend group That is like up to you to decide based off what you already know about your new partner. Yeah, that's true
[00:40:45.200] 把你的新伴侣带进你的所有朋友圈，这完全取决于你对伴侣的了解程度。没错，确实如此。
[00:40:55.040] I think some people do better in small group settings versus other people do better in large group settings and then Sussing that out is like your job as the person Introducing your partner to all your friends and I guess it's also your job to choose a good
[00:40:55.040] 我认为有些人更适合小组活动，而有些人则更适合大型团体活动。弄清楚这一点就像你作为介绍人需要把伴侣介绍给所有朋友一样，我想这也是你的职责所在，你需要选择一个好的……
[00:41:09.560] Couple if you're trying to do a double date to be like, alright this this couple will make me seem less weird Or it could be like oh this couple knows me really well Like this hanging out with this couple is like the best and most accurate representation
[00:41:09.560] 如果你想和另一对情侣进行双人约会，你可能会想：“好吧，这对情侣会让我看起来不那么奇怪。”或者你可能会想：“哦，这对情侣真的很了解我。”就像和这对情侣一起出去玩，就像是对我的最好、最真实的诠释。
[00:41:26.480] Of me and my humor and like my past life. So maybe that's how you choose the couple as well Me immediately thinking about the impressions So speaking of you know choosing which couples to go on a double date with are there any qualities that
[00:41:26.480] 关于我自己、我的幽默感，还有我的过去。所以也许你也是这样选择情侣的。我立刻想到了这些印象。说到选择和哪些情侣一起进行双人约会，你觉得应该具备哪些特质？
[00:41:43.320] Kind of make you immediately think oh this couple would be like really fun to have a double date with Yes at the very least I think everyone involved in this double date needs to have the potential to be friends as Individuals in the near future. Oh, wow
[00:41:43.320] 这让我立刻想到，哦，和这对情侣一起双人约会肯定很有趣。是的，至少我认为参与这次双人约会的每个人都应该有潜力在不久的将来成为朋友。哇哦。
[00:42:04.720] Dude, that's kind of like hard though, isn't it? It is very hard Yeah Like I mean relationships themselves are hard just trying to melt your entire life and who you are with another Person is a difficult task. And so doing that with double the amount
[00:42:04.720] 兄弟，这真的很难啊，对吧？确实很难。我的意思是，感情本身就很难，要把你的全部生活和你的一切融入到另一个人身上，这本身就是一件很困难的事。更何况还要双倍的投入。
[00:42:23.960] Should also be hard is how I think about that So for me, it's like a good double date will happen if I can see myself being friends with my friend's partner or The other couple as individuals I could spend time alone with that person
[00:42:23.960] 我觉得这也很难。对我来说，一次好的双人约会应该是这样的：我能想象自己和朋友的伴侣，或者另一对情侣，作为独立的个体成为朋友，并且能够和他们单独相处。
[00:42:40.480] I could hold a conversation alone with that person Each person should be comfortable with the other three people Individually and then that way there's no awkwardness like when you are out because sometimes you'll like naturally fall into
[00:42:40.480] 我可以单独和那个人聊天。每个人都应该能和另外三个人单独相处融洽，这样就不会像在外面那样尴尬了，因为有时候你会自然而然地……
[00:42:54.120] Conversations with just one individual and if the other two people aren't comfortable with each other Then it's like pretty weird for them too And that awkwardness does influence the overall environment that the four of us are in right?
[00:42:54.120] 如果只和一个人交谈，而另外两个人彼此之间又不自在，那对他们来说也会很奇怪。这种尴尬确实会影响我们四个人所处的整体环境，对吧？
[00:43:07.120] So making sure that everyone is comfortable with each other on an individual level is very important I guess like to help with that one factor. I'm thinking of is like similar sense of humor for sure
[00:43:07.120] 所以，确保每个人在个人层面上彼此感到自在非常重要，我想这有助于解决这个问题。我指的是相似的幽默感，这当然很重要。
[00:43:20.400] I think one of the like easy things to bond over especially with like new partners is poking fun at your friend right like oh Isn't it annoying how so-and-so does this or like do you ever notice that?
[00:43:20.400] 我认为，和新朋友建立联系的一个简单方法就是取笑你的朋友，比如“某某这样做是不是很烦人？”或者“你有没有注意到这一点？”
[00:43:36.560] Like without trying to cause like drama just something to be like, oh, yeah You know, I have noticed that it's just like oh, yeah I know this person has done that for a long time but then on the flip side
[00:43:36.560] 我不想制造什么戏剧性事件，只是想说，哦，是的。你知道，我注意到，有时候会这样，哦，是的，我知道这个人一直都这样做，但另一方面……
[00:43:46.320] Like it's also could be an endearing quality like it opens the conversation up to be like bonding over what you like About your friends them romantically you platonically
[00:43:46.320] 这可能也是一种令人喜爱的特质，它能开启对话，让你们可以就共同喜欢的事物建立联系，比如谈论你的朋友，无论是浪漫的还是柏拉图式的。
[00:43:59.040] And also the things that you just know from hanging out with this person for a long time and then dating them for However, they along they are dating Mm-hmm. So yeah same sense of humor like they're on board with that then it's really easy
[00:43:59.040] 而且，你跟这个人相处很久，然后又交往一段时间，自然而然就会知道一些事情。不过，他们现在正在交往，嗯哼。所以，如果你们的幽默感很合拍，彼此都能接受，那就很容易了。
[00:44:12.880] But sometimes if they're not you're just like, oh now what do I do? Now now I just feel like an insult to their significant There's nothing more awkward than like a dinner of four people and then three people are laughing and the other one is like
[00:44:12.880] 但有时候如果他们不理你，你就会想，哦，现在我该怎么办？现在我感觉自己像是在侮辱他们的另一半。没有什么比四个人一起吃饭更尴尬的了，三个人在笑，另一个人却……
[00:44:31.360] Yeah, how do you recover from that I think the more I think about it what you said makes total sense Maybe the sign of what makes a really good double date is it doesn't feel super double dating and it more so feels like oh
[00:44:31.360] 是啊，你怎么才能从那种感觉中恢复过来呢？我觉得我越想越觉得你说的很有道理。也许真正好的双人约会的标志就是它不会让人觉得是在刻意地约会，而更像是……哦
[00:44:49.680] we're just for people who like each other's company and enjoy hanging out and It feels less formal less like we are on this for the purpose of a double date and it's just in general better vibes
[00:44:49.680] 我们只欢迎那些彼此喜欢、乐于相处的人，感觉更轻松随意，不像是为了双人约会而来，整体氛围更好。
[00:45:01.400] So I think it makes sense that all four people should be able to consider each other like friends At the very least I think another good thing to have is a shared interest Just because that could be the double date activity itself
[00:45:01.400] 所以我觉得四个人互相视对方为朋友是合情合理的。至少，我认为拥有共同的兴趣爱好也是件好事，因为双人约会本身就可能是一个不错的选择。
[00:45:16.160] And if you know if conversation starts to die, you can at least pull from that shared interest and like get things going again That's why I really like for if I'm actually planning like a double date to do something that is activity like interactive
[00:45:16.160] 如果你知道谈话开始冷场，至少可以利用共同的兴趣爱好让话题重新活跃起来。这就是为什么我特别喜欢在计划双人约会时安排一些互动性强的活动。
[00:45:31.640] acts throwing me I think I've said mini golf like A lot of times but like arcade the arcade or even just something like I don't know pottery making tufting
[00:45:31.640] 让我感到困惑的是，我好像说过很多次迷你高尔夫，但还有街机游戏，或者其他类似的东西，比如陶艺、簇绒等等。
[00:45:43.080] When you've just run out of things to say like just being like, okay now it's time to focus on the thing that we came Here to do is like a very easy way to just fill in the spaces between the conversation
[00:45:43.080] 当你实在没什么可说的时候，比如可以说“好了，现在该专注于我们来这里要做的事情了”，这是一种非常简单的填补对话空白的方法。
[00:45:52.400] I think just one last mini quality that I have is balance So I feel like the couple has to feel balanced where it's not just like
[00:45:52.400] 我觉得我最后一个小小的特质就是平衡感。我觉得夫妻之间必须保持平衡，不能只有一方在，另一方则完全不在。
[00:46:01.000] You're hanging out with one person of other person is an add-on like you have to feel like you're hanging out with both people and Then also the two couples should also feel balanced like it's two units kind of equally hanging out rather than
[00:46:01.000] 你和一个人出去玩，或者和另一个人出去玩，这就像是一种附加条件，你必须感觉像是在和两个人一起玩。而且，这两对情侣之间也应该感觉平衡，就像两个独立的个体平等地一起玩，而不是……
[00:46:13.400] Feeling like it's leaning one way or another which I think it's kind of abstract But then once you're in a double date that doesn't feel balanced. I feel like you can totally feel that like lack of equilibrium
[00:46:13.400] 感觉好像有点偏向某一边，我觉得这种感觉有点抽象。但当你真的和别人一起约会时，就会觉得不平衡。我觉得你完全能感受到那种失衡感。
[00:46:24.440] Yeah, and I think that tends to happen with like when relationships are newer because the other Couple is still like or maybe it could be your own relationship, right? But you're still you're still getting to know each other and on top of getting to know your own partner
[00:46:24.440] 是的，我觉得这种情况在恋爱初期比较常见，因为另一对情侣，或者也可能是你们自己的感情，都还在互相了解，对吧？你们还在熟悉彼此，同时也在了解自己的伴侣。
[00:46:39.440] You're also trying to get to know their friends, right? So it is pretty hard to do but that comes really that balance that you're sensing I find comes very very naturally with couples that are already established Right, like they're already secure with who they are
[00:46:39.440] 你也想了解他们的朋友，对吧？所以这确实很难，但关键在于找到那种平衡，我觉得这种平衡在关系稳定的情侣身上很容易做到，就像他们已经对自己充满自信一样。
[00:46:56.040] Individually and as a couple so that is a good quality to have but I don't know how you can suss that out Without talking to them and already interacting with them. But I guess you're like already on the
[00:46:56.040] 无论是个人还是情侣关系，这都是一项很好的品质，但我不知道在不与他们交谈和互动的情况下，如何才能了解这一点。但我猜你已经在……
[00:47:14.960] Guess the only indication is just like length of relationship pretty safe to assume that these people have been together for a while That it would be easy to approach them as a couple as well I think also if like maybe
[00:47:14.960] 我觉得唯一的线索就是恋爱时长，可以比较肯定地推断这些人在一起已经有一段时间了。这样看来，把他们当作情侣来看待应该也比较容易。我觉得如果……
[00:47:29.780] You know three out of four of that double date has already hung out and had a good time Then it increases the chances because they're like, okay, what's one more? To add to the equation, you know, hopefully if we all just you know, try hard to like
[00:47:29.780] 你知道，那四人双人约会中，已经有三个人出去玩过，而且玩得很开心了。这样一来，成功的几率就增加了，因为他们会想，好吧，再多一个又何妨？为了增加成功的几率，你知道，希望如果我们都努力去喜欢对方的话。
[00:47:45.480] To be friendly and to be inclusive then it'll be like most likely better results than worse ones Well, this has been such an interesting conversation. I feel like I'm looking at double dates way more analytically now Before we started recording but in a good way
[00:47:45.480] 友好包容的态度，很可能会带来更好的结果。嗯，这次谈话真有趣。感觉我现在看待双人约会的方式比录音前更加理性了，不过是往好的方向发展。
[00:48:02.800] Like I think double dates are a really great opportunity to get to know people Get to know your friend better or your friends so better, etc So thank you for sharing your tips and your personal perspectives on double dates and
[00:48:02.800] 我觉得双人约会是个非常好的机会，可以更好地了解彼此，比如更好地了解你的朋友，或者让你的朋友更了解你等等。所以，非常感谢你分享关于双人约会的建议和个人看法。
