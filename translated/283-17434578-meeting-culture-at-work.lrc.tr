[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Jimmy.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal。我是Jeesoo。我是Jimmy。
[00:00:15.550] So this week, we felt the urge to talk about work. I feel like most people have to experience this at least a handful of times per week. And they can vary a lot from being really efficient, being really helpful to sometimes just feeling like wasted time or not the best use of time.
[00:00:15.550] 所以这周，我们很想聊聊工作。我觉得大多数人每周至少都会有几次这样的经历。工作体验可能千差万别，有的高效实用，有的却感觉浪费时间，或者根本没用上。
[00:00:38.410] So we wanted to take today to talk about meetings at work, how you deal with them, what have you found to work for you, and just in general, your relationship with work meetings. First question I have for everyone is how many meetings do you typically have? How many meetings per day? And then how many meetings per week? Dude, meeting about meetings after a day of meetings.
[00:00:38.410] 所以今天我们想聊聊工作中的会议，你们是如何应对的，哪些方法对你们有效，以及你们与工作会议的总体关系。我的第一个问题是，你们通常要开多少个会？每天多少个？每周多少个？老兄，一天开完会之后还要再开个会讨论会议。
[00:01:08.870] I'm prepared, honestly, just to wait until the end and say thank you. I have probably around like four meetings per day. I guess five if you count stand-up. The stand-up is like, you know, it's like 15 minutes. It's a baby meeting. But yeah, around like four meetings per day. Dang, so you end up maybe with like 20-ish per week? Yeah, times five.
[00:01:08.870] 说实话，我已经做好准备，就等到最后再说声谢谢。我大概每天要开四个会。如果算上站立会议的话，大概五个。站立会议嘛，你知道的，也就十五分钟，算是个小会议。不过，一天大概要开四个会。哎，那你一周大概要开二十个会吧？对，乘以五。
[00:01:34.050] Dude, that sounds like a lot. Because I was counting my meetings this week. And I was like, this is kind of a meeting heavy week for me in my new company. And I had 10 meetings. And seeing you say you have 20 is actually a lot. Oh my god, this week is probably even worse too. Because our fiscal year ends this week. You know, June. Our fiscal year is weird. I don't get the companies that end in the middle of summer.
[00:01:34.050] 老兄，听起来好多啊。因为我这周一直在数我的会议。我当时就想，这周在我新公司算是会议特别多的一周了。我开了10个会。看你说你有20个，那真的太多了。我的天，这周可能更糟。因为我们的财年这周就结束了。你知道，六月。我们的财年很奇怪。我不理解那些在盛夏结束财年的公司。
[00:02:03.590] But ours is ending. So everyone's like pumping out more meetings, more meetings. Everyone just wants to meet to ask like favors and stuff. Yeah, I feel that. I think in my past job, it was similar where I would just dread meetings because every meeting would just birth more work. The worst part is sometimes it's okay because it'll be like an exchange, you know, like some decisions will be made. So some loose ends are tied.
[00:02:03.590] 但我们的时代快结束了。所以大家都在疯狂开会，开个不停。每个人都想开会，找人帮忙什么的。是啊，我也有同感。我觉得我以前的工作也差不多，我特别害怕开会，因为每次开会都会产生更多的工作。最糟糕的是，有时候开会也还不错，因为开会就像是交流，你知道，会做出一些决定。这样一些遗留问题就解决了。
[00:02:28.570] And then you have like a new project to start on or something like that. But the times where those loose ends aren't tied. So there's like ongoing decisions that are just like put off and then new projects are made. I'm like, I can't handle another meeting. It's a perpetual cycle that just never ends. Every single time is like, Jimmy, you want to take that action item? You know, circle back around like next week? No, I don't want to take any action items.
[00:02:28.570] 然后，比如你又得启动一个新项目之类的。但有时候，那些未解决的问题还没解决。所以，一些决策就一直被搁置，然后新的项目又被提了出来。我就想，我再也受不了开会了。这简直是个永无止境的循环。每次都是这样：“吉米，你想推进那个行动项吗？你知道，下周再讨论一下？” 不，我不想推进任何行动项。
[00:02:55.950] I actually tend to not have too many meetings in my day to day. On a chill week, I can get away with as little as six meetings for the whole week. Yeah, so like maybe an average of one to two a day. I think I've never had more than like 15 in a week other than like events. Lucky you. Are you more like an individual contributor?
[00:02:55.950] 其实我日常工作中开会不多。如果一周比较轻松，可能只需要六个会就够了。嗯，平均每天大概一到两个。除了活动之外，我一周最多也就开过十五个会。你真幸运。你是那种独立贡献者吗？
[00:03:22.590] Yeah, because my work is in design and it's kind of isolated. I don't have to like do as much of the business relations just like in terms of overall project management. It's just like they've kind of already project managed most of this. My part is just like, hey, can you do this like graphic or whatever? So then my meeting time with the other people is pretty minimal or really quick.
[00:03:22.590] 是的，因为我的工作是设计，而且比较独立。我不需要处理太多业务关系，也不需要参与整体项目管理。他们基本上已经负责了大部分项目管理工作。我的工作就是，比如，嘿，你们能不能做这个，比如平面设计之类的？所以我和其他人开会的时间非常少，或者说很快就结束了。
[00:03:48.630] Yeah, I guess that brings up the good point of depending on what your role is in a meeting. It can also feel very different. For example, I said I had about 10 meetings a week. A lot of them are like all hands, some sort of like big group team meeting or something where I don't have to present. I just can like sit and like listen to information versus in my past role.
[00:03:48.630] 是的，我想这确实引出了一个很重要的观点，那就是会议体验会因你在会议中的角色而异。比如，我之前说过我每周要开大约10次会议。很多都是全体员工大会，或者某种大型团队会议之类的，我不需要做报告。我只需要坐在那里听取信息，这和我以前的工作截然不同。
[00:04:08.770] I felt like a lot of my meetings I was leading. So then preparing to lead a meeting has a lot of homework in itself of like you have to prep the agenda, send it out a couple of days prior. Oftentimes, if you're doing meetings with leadership, you have to like present a deck and stuff. Not only that, you have to like assign someone to take notes or you yourself might be taking notes and then afterwards you send out like a recap.
[00:04:08.770] 我感觉自己主持了很多会议。所以，主持会议本身就需要做很多准备工作，比如要提前准备议程，提前几天发出去。通常情况下，如果是和领导层开会，你还得准备演示文稿之类的。不仅如此，你还得安排人做会议记录，或者自己做记录，会后还要发一份总结。
[00:04:31.090] So going from the meetings that I used to have in my old job and then going to the meetings that I have now, even if they were the same number of meetings, I think it would just feel super different for me. I think also there's an aspect of meetings where it's up to you a little bit. I think I could totally have more meetings in my day to day if I wanted to set up time with the people that I work with. Like, hey, can you chat really fast? I need to like clarify this or ask a question.
[00:04:31.090] 所以，从我以前工作中的会议，到我现在的会议，即使会议数量相同，感觉也会截然不同。我觉得会议也有一部分是可以自主安排的。如果我想和同事们多聊聊，我完全可以安排更多会议。比如，我可以说：“嘿，你能快速聊一会儿吗？我需要澄清一下或者问个问题。”
[00:04:58.710] But I guess I'm just so much more used to like pinging someone or even shooting an email. Because of that, I also cut down on my meetings because sometimes people will ping me and they'll be like, hey, do you have time right now to hop on a call? And I'm like, OK, I guess. I'm usually the pinger in that situation. That probably explains why I have 20 meetings. Honestly, a big fan of like chit chat, you know, people that I like at least.
[00:04:58.710] 但我猜我更习惯于发个消息或者发封邮件。正因为如此，我也减少了会议次数，因为有时候别人会联系我，问我“嘿，你现在有空打个电话吗？” 我就会说“好吧，可以”。通常情况下，都是我主动联系别人。这大概能解释为什么我一天要开20个会。说实话，我其实很喜欢和人闲聊，至少是和我喜欢的人聊。
[00:05:28.970] Especially like one on one situations, you could probably chit chat a lot more and gossip a little bit and stuff. I'm usually the hey, you want to hop on a call or hey, I'm going to put something on your calendar. Accept it. You're like there's no decline button. There's no decline button. Oh, my God. Don't even dare hit like tentative or something. I mean, I think to an extent, meetings like that are unavoidable sometimes.
[00:05:28.970] 尤其是一对一的场合，你们可以聊很多，说说八卦什么的。我通常会说：“嘿，你想打个电话吗？”或者“嘿，我给你安排个时间。”接受吧。你会说：“没有拒绝按钮。没有拒绝按钮。我的天哪。”千万别点“暂定”之类的。我的意思是，我觉得在某种程度上，这样的会议有时是不可避免的。
[00:05:55.990] It's just so much faster to hop on a quick call and like sort through something, especially if it's like a more complex issue or if there's like a lot of different moving pieces or something. But for me, I have this whole thing of like not wanting a meeting to go over so I can like do the chit chat in the beginning. And then after it hits like 210 or something, I'll like cut it off and I'll be like, OK, anyways, let's jump into the actual.
[00:05:55.990] 打个电话快速解决问题要快得多，尤其是在处理比较复杂的问题或者涉及很多环节的时候。但我有个习惯，就是不想让会议超时，所以想在开头闲聊几句。等到210分钟左右，我就会结束聊天，然后说，好了，我们直接进入正题吧。
[00:06:24.010] You're like agenda chit chat for five minutes. Yeah, no more. That's me. I'm like, that's enough. It's like a checklist. Like, OK, first, let's talk about Love Island. Honestly, I do like the chit chat, too. It's like sort of devious because I chit chat for the first like 15 minutes of a 30 minute. And then I'd be like, OK, let's get to work.
[00:06:24.010] 你就像那种会闲聊五分钟，然后就结束了。对，不能再多了。我就是这样。我会说，够了。就像列个清单一样。比如，好，首先，我们来聊聊《爱情岛》。说实话，我也喜欢闲聊。这有点狡猾，因为我会在30分钟的节目里先闲聊15分钟。然后我就会说，好了，开始工作吧。
[00:06:49.550] And then the work is, you know, fast paced, like get done, get done, get done, you know, no ideation, nothing. Just like this is what I need you to do. Just do it. You don't give them time to like refute your tasks. No, that wastes time. So inefficient. It's an interesting split of a meeting block. Like half chit chat. You got to warm them up, you know, you got to make them feel good.
[00:06:49.550] 然后工作节奏就很快，你知道，就是不停地完成、完成、完成，没有思考，什么都没有。就像是“这就是我需要你做的，去做就行了”。你根本不给他们时间反驳你的任务。不，那样浪费时间，效率太低了。这真是个有趣的会议环节分割方式。一半时间闲聊，一半时间闲聊。你得先让他们放松下来，让他们感觉良好。
[00:07:16.890] And then 15 minutes of just like, OK, you got to do this, this, this. Like, thank you. Honestly, I see the benefits in that because sometimes when say you have a 30 minute meeting that only really needs like 10, 15. If you finish early, sometimes someone will start blabbing or rambling about the project. And you're like, OK, no. Can we just end this meeting? Exactly.
[00:07:16.890] 然后花15分钟时间，比如，“好了，你得做这个，做那个，做这个。” 就像，“谢谢。” 说实话，我觉得这样做的好处在于，有时候，比如说，一个30分钟的会议，其实只需要10、15分钟就够了。如果你提前结束，有些人就会开始喋喋不休地谈论项目。然后你就会想，“好了，不行。我们能结束这个会议吗？” 没错。
[00:07:41.070] I'd much rather spend 15 minutes talking about Love Island versus like, you know, 15 minutes being like, oh, like maybe this would be better, you know? No. And I'm like more likely to do something for you if we talk about like even something as simple as the weather in the beginning. Like it just like humanizes you a little bit knowing like what you're up to or like your pets or any sort of like random topic that's outside of work. But I will say I make mental notes sometimes of people who always run over meetings.
[00:07:41.070] 我宁愿花15分钟聊聊《爱情岛》，也不想花15分钟胡思乱想，比如“哦，也许这个更好”，你知道吗？不。如果我们一开始聊些像天气这样简单的话题，我更有可能为你做点什么。这样能让我更了解你，知道你在做什么，或者你的宠物，或者任何工作以外的随机话题，这会让你显得更有人情味。不过，我得说，我有时会暗暗记下那些总是超时的人。
[00:08:10.030] Like I'm not purposely trying to do it, but I'll remember, you know, and my mental log will like automatically get updated. And I'm like, damn, this person always goes over. Like maybe I shouldn't schedule this other meeting right after. Or like I'll like know to book the meeting room longer or something. Are you cutting off the chit chat then with those people? I just run a stricter ship for that one. Yeah. Can you please shut up out the weather?
[00:08:10.030] 我不是故意要超时，但我会记住，你知道，我的脑子里就会自动更新记录。然后我就想，该死，这个人总是超时。也许我不应该紧接着安排另一个会议。或者我应该提前多订几次会议室之类的。那你是不是就不跟这些人闲聊了？我在这方面管得更严一些。是啊。你能别再说天气了吗？
[00:08:37.030] Kind of related to what you do, Jisoo, I also take note of the people who I work with who are super busy, who oftentimes come late to our meetings because their like previous meeting was running late or something like that. So then it's always a joy to be like, ah, yes, I have two more minutes until that person probably shows up. So true. They're always like consistent to about like they're always late, consistently late.
[00:08:37.030] Jisoo，这跟你做的有点关系，我也会留意那些超级忙的同事，他们经常开会迟到，可能是因为上一个会议超时之类的。所以每次看到他们，我都会很开心，心想：啊，对，还有两分钟，他们应该就到了。确实如此。他们总是迟到，简直是屡教不改。
[00:09:04.530] But they're also like, in my case, at least, they're also like pretty consistent with how much time they're usually late. You know, like my manager, three minutes on the dot every time. Three minutes. Yeah. So I'll see the notification like, you know, the Microsoft Teams notification. And I'll be like, OK, great. Let me fill up my water. Let me go to the bathroom. So then aside from like recurring people, let's talk a little bit about recurring meetings.
[00:09:04.530] 但至少就我而言，他们迟到的时间也相当稳定。你知道，比如我的经理，每次都准时迟到三分钟。三分钟。没错。所以我会看到通知，比如微软Teams的通知。然后我会想，好的，太好了。让我去倒杯水。让我去趟洗手间。那么，除了这些固定的人之外，我们来聊聊定期会议吧。
[00:09:33.390] Like I'm sure you all have Jimmy mentioned earlier, like stand up sometimes or team meetings. My first question is, do you ever feel like you have almost a specific persona or role in that meeting? Because in my team meeting, I feel like I'm always the quiet, don't really talk too much, share very little person of the team.
[00:09:33.390] 就像吉米之前提到的那样，你们肯定都经历过站立会议或者团队会议。我的第一个问题是，你们是否觉得自己在会议中扮演着某种特定的角色？因为在我的团队会议上，我感觉自己总是那个安静、不怎么说话、很少分享的人。
[00:09:57.450] And then we also have some that I've noticed that are like one person who loves to give really long, thorough explanations. Another person who is like the note taker and like the busy mom, that kind of stuff. So what do you see in your meetings? I feel so bad for this note taker person. They're known as the note taker. That fucking sucks.
[00:09:57.450] 我还注意到有些人特别喜欢长篇大论地解释，有些人则像个记笔记的，还有人像个忙碌的妈妈，诸如此类。所以，你们开会的时候都看到些什么呢？我真替那个记笔记的人感到难过。他们被大家叫做“记笔记员”。真是太糟糕了。
[00:10:24.690] Wait, actually, I helped out with the note taking. Oh no! My role is actually so much easier though, but our note taker quietly took on the role herself. And then she just like writes a couple bullet points for each person when they share their like weekly updates. When it's her turn because she's talking, I'll take her notes. Dude, can I get this person's contact? Can I get like my company's headhunter to get her? It's crazy. Wait, no, we need her.
[00:10:24.690] 等等，其实我帮忙记笔记了。哦不！其实我的角色轻松多了，但我们的记录员悄悄地承担了这项工作。她会在每个人分享每周工作进展的时候，给他们写几个要点。轮到她发言的时候，我就帮她记笔记。哥们儿，我能要到她的联系方式吗？我能不能让公司的猎头帮她搞定？太疯狂了。等等，不行，我们需要她。
[00:10:56.430] It's not fun being the note taker. I was like always the note taker in the small and big meetings of my past job. And I started to feel like, not like resentment, but kind of resentment of like, why is it always me? And then I would notice, right? Because I would observe who the other note takers were and it was always women. And I was like, this is crazy. It's so interesting that you guys have just like unspoken note takers.
[00:10:56.430] 当记录员真不是什么乐事。以前在公司，无论大小会议，我总是负责记录。后来我开始觉得，不是怨恨，而是有点儿不爽，为什么总是我？然后我注意到，对吧？因为我会观察其他记录员，发现她们总是女性。我就想，这太奇怪了。你们居然有这种不成文的记录员机制，真是太有意思了。
[00:11:25.850] For my immediate team, for our monthly meetings, we'll have like a meeting minutes person per quarter. So we have like a wheel and we'll spin it. And yeah, you know, it's always like the nice like sarcastic, like, oh, congrats on the role. Oh, yeah, everyone chuckles. I kind of like that. It's a good system. That is a pretty good system. Everyone's forced to be one, you know?
[00:11:25.850] 就我所在的团队而言，我们每月例会都会安排一个季度会议记录员。我们有个转盘，转动它就能决定谁负责记录。你知道，结果总是那种带着点讽刺意味的玩笑，比如，“恭喜你获得这个职位。” 哦，是啊，大家都会笑。我挺喜欢这种方式的。这套系统挺好的。确实挺不错的。每个人都被迫扮演这个角色，你知道吗？
[00:11:53.990] That's why I feel bad for whoever just got stuck with that role. Spin a wheel. Dude, no, taking aside, sometimes the team meetings where you go around and share updates and you know how people always be like, oh, it doesn't have to be like a work update. Like you can share whatever. Like coming up with a story for that sometimes is like an actual task on my agenda. Like I'm like, oh, come up with story for the team meetings. Like what have I been up to? Wait, same.
[00:11:53.990] 所以我觉得那些被安排做这个角色的人挺惨的。转转轮盘什么的。哥们儿，不，先不说这个，有时候团队会议上大家轮流汇报工作进展，你知道的，总有人会说，哦，不一定要汇报工作进展，什么都可以分享。但有时候，想个故事来跟大家分享，真的成了我日程上的一项任务。我就会想，哦，得给团队会议想个故事。我最近都在忙些什么呢？等等，我也是。
[00:12:22.310] I definitely feel like the Monday standups were like, oh, you know, what'd you do for the weekend? I have to dilute how much fun I had over the weekend every time. You know, I can't go out, right? And be like, oh, yeah. So Friday I partied all night. Saturday, oh, yeah, I also did that too. And then Sunday I just watched television because I was incapacitated the entire day. I couldn't do anything. Dude, I am the opposite of Jimmy.
[00:12:22.310] 我感觉周一的脱口秀就像在问：“哦，你知道，你周末干嘛了？” 我每次都得淡化一下周末玩得有多开心。你知道，我不可能出去玩，对吧？然后就说：“哦，是啊。周五我玩了一整晚。周六，哦，对，我也玩了一整晚。然后周日我就只能看电视，因为我一整天都动不了。我什么都做不了。老兄，我跟吉米完全相反。”
[00:12:50.770] People are like, oh, my God, so how was everyone's weekend? And I was like, it was good. I just stayed home. Well, that's what I usually dilute to. So they probably think I'm a crystal, you know? Damn. Like, damn, this guy just doesn't really go out, huh? Sometimes I'm like, I played golf over the weekend. And they're like, whoa, you left the house?
[00:12:50.770] 人们会问，我的天哪，大家周末过得怎么样？我就说，挺好的。我就待在家里。嗯，我通常都这样。所以他们可能觉得我像个水晶一样，你知道吗？哎。就像，哎，这家伙好像从来不出门似的，是吧？有时候我会说，我周末去打高尔夫了。他们就会说，哇，你居然出门了？
[00:13:18.590] I feel like this is when it pays off to have really specific and like niche hobbies that you can talk about. Because even if you say like the smallest thing, even if you went like surfing for like 10 minutes, you know, it's like super cool. But I feel like I'm always saying, oh, I just like hung out with some friends. And then that's like it. Like, that's the story. Like, I cannot divulge any more than that. Yeah. Yeah. No questions, please.
[00:13:18.590] 我觉得这时候拥有一些非常具体、小众的爱好就显得尤为重要，因为你可以跟别人聊这些。哪怕你只是说说一件小事，比如去冲浪了十分钟，你知道，那感觉都超级酷。但我感觉我总是说，“哦，我只是和朋友们出去玩了一下。”然后就没了。就好像，这就是全部的故事。就好像我不能透露更多。是啊。是啊。请不要再问问题了。
[00:13:44.030] Dude, I actually dread the meetings, though, when I'm like, I have nothing to say this week. Like, I have no updates for you all. I'm like, what do I say? How do I skip this meeting? Honestly, I'm sad to admit this is like, honestly, a daily occurrence at this point, where I don't have any updates. So I'll just, I'll like put it put the volume like super high on my computer. So I'm like tuning in. But then since I work from home, my TV is like right there.
[00:13:44.030] 老兄，说实话，我其实挺害怕开会的，尤其是当我感觉这周没什么可说的，没什么新进展要跟大家汇报的时候。我就想，我该说什么呢？怎么才能逃掉这个会？老实说，很遗憾，这种情况现在几乎每天都会发生，我根本没什么可汇报的。所以我就把电脑音量调到最大，一边听一边听。不过因为我在家办公，电视就在旁边。
[00:14:14.050] I usually always have a show I'm binging. And so I'll just be watching a show, you know. And then going back to your question, my persona. I'm the stay quiet the entire meeting. And then at the very end, unmute. Thank you. And then just quickly leave. Same, same. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I feel like we're pretty young.
[00:14:14.050] 我通常都会追一部剧。所以我就一直看剧，你知道的。回到你的问题，我的性格是，我会全程保持安静。然后在最后，我会取消静音。谢谢。然后就赶紧离开。对，对。是啊，我同意。我的意思是，我觉得我们还很年轻。
[00:14:35.090] I think the people who speak up a lot in meetings tend to be like more leadership or like executives or people who have been at the company for a long time. But I will say when people our age or like people at a similar level as us really speak up in especially those big meetings, raise your hand in like a 50 person meeting type of thing. I'm like, damn, like you're pretty cool. You're a boss.
[00:14:35.090] 我觉得在会议上积极发言的人往往是领导层、高管或者在公司待了很久的老员工。但我想说，当我们这个年纪或者和我们级别相近的人在大型会议上，比如50人的会议上，积极发言的时候，我就会想，哇，你真厉害，你真有魄力。
[00:15:00.950] Dude, but I also wonder sometimes I'm like, I feel like I don't share that much. Just like bits and pieces, like crumbs of my personal life. And I'm usually pretty quiet in meetings. I wonder if I give off like mysterious or just like boring. I can totally see that. I've known you for like, what, 12, 13 years?
[00:15:00.950] 兄弟，不过有时候我也在想，我觉得自己好像不太爱分享。就零零碎碎地透露一点，就像分享一些个人生活的碎屑。而且开会的时候我通常也很安静。我在想，我这样会不会给人一种神秘莫测或者很无聊的感觉。我完全能理解。我认识你大概有十二三年了吧？
[00:15:29.230] And that's 100% true. I think you tear the line well, Crystal. I think you really did. I think. Wow, thanks. Very mysterious person. I feel like this is maybe the theme, you know. I'm like the opposite of you where I go from either I overshare or I just don't say anything at all in a meeting, you know.
[00:15:29.230] 没错，百分之百是这样。我觉得你把话说得很透彻，克丽丝塔尔。真的，我觉得你做到了。哇，谢谢。你真是个神秘的人。我觉得这可能就是主题吧。你知道吗？我跟你正好相反，要么在会议上滔滔不绝，要么干脆一句话也不说。
[00:15:55.870] Either I'm the one driving it or I'm just not even in the car. That is also fitting, actually. For sure. Damn, I'm trying to think if I have a role or persona. I mean, I think it's hard because I'm still getting settled into my new role in my new company. But if I think back to my past job where I was more established, I think I drove a lot of the meetings.
[00:15:55.870] 要么是我在开车，要么我根本就不在车里。其实这样也挺贴切的。确实如此。哎，我正在努力思考自己到底扮演着怎样的角色或人物。我的意思是，我觉得这很难，因为我还在适应新公司的新角色。但如果回想一下我之前那份比较稳定的工作，我想我当时主持了很多会议。
[00:16:22.950] And I would kind of come prepared and whatnot. But I wouldn't say I enjoyed it. You know what I mean? Like it wasn't something that I was happily doing. I think it kind of felt like a mental burden on me to an extent. So in my new job where I am kind of figuring out my role, I'm trying to think what I prefer instead of like what I should be doing. So you get to rebrand. Yeah. So for now, I'm nothing. But soon I'll be something.
[00:16:22.950] 我会做好充分的准备什么的。但我不能说我喜欢那份工作。你明白我的意思吗？感觉做起来并不开心。某种程度上，它给我带来了精神负担。所以，在新工作中，我还在摸索自己的角色，我试着思考自己更喜欢什么，而不是应该做什么。这样就相当于重新塑造自己。是的。所以现在，我什么都不是。但很快我就会有所作为。
[00:16:52.250] Dude, maybe you could be like the jokester. Oh. Oh. Hmm. I have to like bring that out though. You know, like I have to like really pull it up. I definitely have a jokester in one of my team meetings. Oh. It's not that fun. I feel like it's a mental burden, Jimmy. You won't just expect to have fun with me. I hate it. Sometimes I don't want to be here. You know how hard it is?
[00:16:52.250] 哥们儿，也许你可以当个开心果。哦。哦。嗯。不过我得刻意表现出来才行。你知道，就像我得真的拿出点真本事。我的团队会议上肯定有个开心果。哦。其实没那么好玩。我觉得这很费脑筋，吉米。你不能指望跟我一起玩得开心。我讨厌这样。有时候我都不想待在这里。你知道这有多难吗？
[00:17:22.130] Like in the very beginning, right? I would talk a lot, you know? I was the jokester and stuff. You know, gradually I stopped really caring and I'm just like watching. I keep saying Love Island, but really it's very true right now before it was anime. And I'm just like quiet because I just have my, you know, mic muted and I'm just like watching, you know? I'm not like engaged or anything. And people miss the jokes, you know? People miss the jokes.
[00:17:22.130] 就像一开始那样，对吧？我以前话很多，你知道吗？我是个爱开玩笑的人什么的。你知道，慢慢地我就不太在意了，就只是个旁观者。我一直说像《爱情岛》，但其实现在的情况很像，以前是动漫。我现在很安静，因为我把麦克风关了，就只是看着，你知道吗？我没参与，也没做什么。所以大家错过了我的笑点，你知道吗？大家都错过了我的笑点。
[00:17:47.670] Like word for word, my manager one time, she noticed and she was like, hey, Jimmy, like I noticed you're pretty quiet. I'm like, oh yeah, you know, I'm just, I just want to let other people talk, right? I just want to let people, you know, share and stuff. Get their voices out there. That's a good response. Damn. I'm not going to lie. Like when the jokester is quiet during meetings, I get worried. I'm like, is something going on in this person's personal life? Yeah, you're like, are they okay?
[00:17:47.670] 就像我经理有一次注意到我最近很安静一样，她就说：“嘿，吉米，我注意到你今天挺安静的。” 我说：“哦，是啊，你知道，我只是想让其他人多说说话，对吧？我想让大家分享一下，让他们有机会表达自己的想法。” 这回应真不错。说实话，有时候平时爱开玩笑的人在会议上突然安静下来，我就会担心。我会想，是不是这个人私生活里出了什么事？是啊，你会想，他们还好吗？
[00:18:17.270] Like wellness check. Maybe one day I'll get there. I think for now I'm the smile and nodder. Like I like smile vigorously and I like nod a lot. Same, same. Nice smile and nodder. Every team needs that, you know? Give me out my best facial expressions. I also use like the emojis. Oh my God. That's me too. I love the reacts. A little thumbs up here and there, you know? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. The clapping one. Oh yeah. Yeah, the clapping.
[00:18:17.270] 就像健康检查一样。也许有一天我能做到。我觉得现在我更擅长微笑和点头。我喜欢热情地微笑，也喜欢不停地点头。没错，没错。灿烂的笑容和点头。每个团队都需要这样的人，你知道吗？尽情展现我最棒的表情吧。我也喜欢用表情符号。我的天哪。那也是我。我喜欢各种表情。时不时点个赞，你知道吗？哦耶。哦耶。鼓掌的那个。哦耶。对，鼓掌。
[00:18:47.650] If I'm being honest, I'm the, I'm the react spammer. It makes them feel good. Yeah. Like one clap is good, but if you clap a lot, then they're like, oh my God, I really did do a good job. That's true. I also sometimes respond by typing because I don't want to unmute and then talk and then make it accidentally talk over someone and then make it awkward and everyone's waiting for you to finish your thought. Just type and then everyone can read it and be like, cool.
[00:18:47.650] 说实话，我就是那种喜欢疯狂点赞的人。这样他们会觉得很开心。没错。就像一个掌声就不错，但如果你点很多次，他们就会觉得，天哪，我做得真棒。确实如此。我有时候也会打字回复，因为我不想取消静音再说话，万一不小心打断别人，气氛就会很尴尬，大家都在等我说完。直接打字回复，大家都能看到，然后会觉得，酷。
[00:19:17.310] Yeah. When I said to my manager, you know, that I want other people to like share more. That's actually kind of true, you know? And so I don't want to like interrupt someone. I'll just like put something in the chat. And then once they finish their thought, then usually people are like, oh, Jimmy put something in the chat and they'll read it and be like, oh yeah. Okay. And then I'll give a thumbs up after. Combo. Combo.
[00:19:17.310] 是啊。我跟经理说，我想让大家多分享。其实也确实如此，你知道吗？所以我不想打断别人。我就在聊天框里发点东西。等他们说完，通常大家会说，哦，吉米发东西了，然后他们就会看到，说，哦，好的。之后我还会点个赞。就这样，就搞定了。
[00:19:45.710] I will say though, I've had times where I'm like, oh, you know, someone's talking. I don't want to talk over them. So I'll like put something in the chat and then the person talking will like stop because they see the chat come up and they're like, oh, GC said this. And I'm like, fuck, like this is the exact opposite of what I was wanting. Oh my God. Yeah. When we're like, oh, hold on. Let me see what. It's definitely like a line.
[00:19:45.710] 不过我得说，有时候我会想，哎呀，有人在说话。我不想打断他们。所以我会在聊天框里发点东西，然后说话的人就会停下来，因为他们看到聊天框弹出来了，然后说，哦，GC说了这个。我就想，我去，这完全跟我想要的完全相反。我的天哪。是啊。有时候我们会想，哦，等等。让我看看。这绝对是一种界限。
[00:20:11.070] I think I'm well settled into my new role of the chat emoji guy now. You're the keyboard warrior now. You're the keyboard warrior. Do you guys ever unmute just to laugh or no? Oh my God. Wait, sometimes. I do do it as well. If there's a chorus of laughter and it's safe to unmute and join in.
[00:20:11.070] 我觉得我已经完全适应了聊天表情包大王这个新角色。你现在是键盘侠了。你就是键盘侠。你们会为了笑而解开静音吗？我的天哪。等等，有时候会。我也会。如果周围都是笑声，而且解开静音加入其中也没什么问题的话。
[00:20:40.830] You'll only do it if you're like your laugh doesn't stand out. And I kind of implies there's like a time where it's not safe to laugh. There's definitely like a group mentality, you know, because either someone bombs a joke or like they get a chorus of laughter. First, no one wants to be the guy who tells a joke. No one laughs. But also no one wants to be the person who's the only one laughing. True.
[00:20:40.830] 只有当你觉得自己的笑声不够出众时，你才会这么做。这其实暗示着，有时候笑是不安全的。这其中肯定存在一种群体心理，你知道，因为要么有人讲笑话冷场，要么有人讲笑话引来一片哄笑。首先，没人想当那个讲笑话的人。没人会笑。但同样，也没人想成为唯一一个笑的人。没错。
[00:21:09.730] And sometimes when you laugh or, you know, talk over someone, it cuts the original audio off a little bit. But it's safer to just like react or know that they're done talking and then unmuting to laugh a bit. Well, what I'll do nowadays is like I'll like laugh really hard visually, you know, like obviously laughing like ha ha ha ha. But I'll stay muted so that they can keep talking. But I'm like encouraging them like, look, I'm laughing. Dude, we're all just mimes.
[00:21:09.730] 有时候，当你笑或者打断别人说话的时候，会稍微切断原声。但比较稳妥的做法是，先做出反应，或者等他们说完话后再打开静音笑一笑。我现在会做的，就是用夸张的表情大笑，你知道，就是那种很明显的“哈哈哈哈”的笑声。但我会保持静音，这样他们就可以继续说下去。我会鼓励他们说：“看，我在笑呢。伙计，我们都只是哑剧演员而已。”
[00:21:39.810] Mimes on the video call. Yeah. Give them a little visual thumbs up. Wait, I totally thumbs up. You thumbs up? Yeah. Sometimes I'll start the meeting off like, how's everyone feeling this week? And like thumbs up. Stay muted. Wait, that's so funny. You won't even unmute and be like, good. That's like the standard. Yeah.
[00:21:39.810] 视频通话里有人比划手势。对。给他们竖个大拇指。等等，我肯定会竖大拇指。你也竖大拇指？对。有时候我会在会议开始时问大家这周感觉怎么样？然后竖起大拇指。保持静音。等等，这太搞笑了。你甚至都不会取消静音，然后说“很好”。这都成惯例了。对。
[00:22:10.230] You're really the deep end, Kristen. I can tell you do it a lot too, because when you did that, it looked pretty legit. You even like had the right facial expression. Yeah. It's practiced. It's rehearsed. Oh my god. Well, I guess aside from something like a TV, for big meetings, do you guys put your camera on or is it by default camera off? Camera off, muted.
[00:22:10.230] 克里斯汀，你真是个高手啊。看得出来你经常这么做，因为你刚才那一幕看起来挺像真的。你连表情都模仿得惟妙惟肖。是啊，肯定是练习过的，排练过的。我的天哪。嗯，我想除了电视之类的设备，在大型会议上，你们会打开摄像头吗？还是默认是关着的？摄像头关着，也静音了。
[00:22:40.650] Yeah. Camera off, muted. I'm not even in the room. Yeah, I feel like those big meetings, like sometimes it's like orientation or maybe like a big all hands. Some of our like company wide, all hands are so big that it's just streamed to the company. It's like not even a meeting. Right. So then it's just like on in the background. I'm like making breakfast or like getting the day started, camera off, muted, all of that. Yeah.
[00:22:40.650] 是啊。摄像头关了，静音了。我甚至都不在房间里。是啊，我觉得那些大型会议，比如有时候是入职培训，或者像全体员工大会之类的。我们公司有些全员大会规模太大了，直接直播给公司所有人看。感觉都不像个会议了。对。所以它就像在后台开着一样。我一边做早餐，一边开始一天的工作，摄像头关了，静音了，诸如此类。是啊。
[00:23:10.770] All hands is like 100% breakfast time for me. Only I've ever not had all hands where I'm not eating breakfast. I think it takes a special type of person to like have their camera on during big meetings. There will be times where I'll like sit in all hands. That's not a webinar. So you can still see like the individual camera slots and stuff. And people are actually like actively listening. I'm like, damn, like you could really be camera off, like laying on your bed, doing something that you want.
[00:23:10.770] 对我来说，全体会议简直就是百分百的早餐时间。我参加过的所有全体会议里，没有一个是没吃早餐的。我觉得在大型会议上开着摄像头的人，确实有点特别。有时候我会参加全体会议，那可不是网络研讨会。所以你还是能看到每个人的摄像头画面之类的。而且大家都在认真听。我就想，天哪，你完全可以关掉摄像头，躺在床上，做自己想做的事啊。
[00:23:39.970] But instead you chose to like show up with your camera on knowing that you'll be blown up on a big TV and like in the actual office. And I'm like, this is crazy. Freaking try hard. They want the recognition. Oh my God. I saw you at the all hands right next to the big screen. I just love how intently you're like listening the entire time. You know, I'm sure the CEO really noticed.
[00:23:39.970] 但你却选择带着摄像头出现，明知道你的镜头会被放大显示在大电视上，甚至会出现在办公室里。我当时就想，这也太疯狂了吧。真是用力过猛。他们就是想出名。我的天哪。我在全体员工大会上看到你了，你就在大屏幕旁边。我喜欢你全程认真聆听的样子。你知道吗，我敢肯定CEO肯定注意到了。
[00:24:05.690] I mean, I don't know if it's the same with you guys, but I feel like it's usually always the salespeople that are like listening in while they're driving or it's leadership with their cameras on. Like there's no one else. Yeah, that's pretty true, I think. But it is funny sometimes where you can still kind of lose interest or like do other things with your camera on. And I think seeing that in a big meeting is so funny where you can see people's like lighting
[00:24:05.690] 我的意思是，我不知道你们是不是也这样，但我感觉通常都是销售人员一边开车一边偷听，或者领导层开着摄像头。好像除了他们就没人注意似的。嗯，确实是这样。不过有时候挺搞笑的，有些人开着摄像头也会走神或者做别的事。我觉得在大型会议上看到这种情况特别有意思，你可以看到大家的灯光。
[00:24:33.130] change because they're opening new windows and stuff or they're like totally looking somewhere else. And I'm always just like, damn, that's hella funny. Yeah, I feel like sometimes when I have to do something, even if it's like leaning over and grabbing my phone, being out of frame, I'm just going to turn my camera off so people don't notice that distraction. But then that also makes me wonder sometimes I'm like, what if I really need to go to the bathroom?
[00:24:33.130] 因为他们会打开新的窗口之类的，或者完全看向别处，所以画面会发生变化。我总是会想，哇，这太搞笑了。是啊，我觉得有时候我要做点什么，哪怕只是弯腰去拿手机，就算不在镜头里，我也会把摄像头关掉，免得别人注意到这个小插曲。但这样一来，有时候我也会想，万一我真的想去洗手间呢？
[00:24:58.690] Like, should I just mute camera off and go to the bathroom in the middle of a meeting? Or do I announce it to the meeting if it's like a smaller one? Or like, what is the move here? Oh my god. You know, I struggled with that when I first joined the company. And then I made the mistake of asking during the meeting if it was... I asked permission to go to the bathroom. Oh no.
[00:24:58.690] 比如，我应该在会议进行到一半的时候关掉摄像头去洗手间吗？还是如果是小型会议，我应该提前通知大家？或者，我到底该怎么做？天哪。你知道吗，我刚入职的时候也为此纠结过。后来我犯了个错误，在会议期间问……我请求允许去洗手间。哦，天哪。
[00:25:26.250] Yeah, I was like, hey, by the way, guys, hopefully it's not, you know, hopefully I'm not interrupting anything, but can I use the restroom? Wait, you unmuted and you said this out loud? Holy fuck. I forgot why it seemed like it was necessary at the time. And my manager's like, what the fuck? Did I just go? Wait, did people laugh? Uh, I don't think so. Oh my god. That's even worse. I know.
[00:25:26.250] 是啊，我当时就说，嘿，对了，各位，希望我没打扰到你们，我能去一下洗手间吗？等等，你居然把麦克风打开了，还大声说了出来？我的天哪。我当时都忘了为什么觉得有必要去洗手间了。然后我经理就说，搞什么鬼？我刚才去洗手间了吗？等等，有人笑了吗？呃，应该没有。我的天哪。这更糟糕了。我知道。
[00:25:57.510] They were probably talking shit while I was going through something. It was so bad. It was like when I was like a fledgling, you know, like stars in the eyes. Like, I just wanted to be the best I could be. Yeah, I mean, it's a tough one. I have to be honest, there are times where I just like take my laptop into the bathroom. When I'm working from home, I'm like, this must be done. Especially if someone's presenting something where I have to see it. I'm like, I guess I'll just take it in.
[00:25:57.510] 他们可能在我经历那些事的时候在背后说我坏话。情况糟透了。就像我刚出头的时候，你知道，眼里闪着星星。我只想做到最好。是啊，这确实很难。说实话，有时候我会直接把笔记本电脑带进卫生间。在家工作的时候，我会想，这事儿必须得做完。尤其是有人要做演示，我必须看的时候。我就会想，那我还是先把演示录进去吧。
[00:26:23.290] But other times for like smaller meetings, I'll just type in the chat like BRB bathroom. And then I'll just go. To be honest, very surprisingly, I haven't encountered needing to go in the middle of a meeting yet. Ever? I fear the day. Whoa. Yeah. Honestly, there's been times where I'm in the office taking a meeting and I just like get up and go to the bathroom. I'm shocked that has never happened to you before. Whoa.
[00:26:23.290] 但有时候，比如开个小会，我就直接在聊天框里打个字，比如“马上回来，去趟洗手间”，然后就去。说实话，很出乎意料的是，我还没遇到过开会开到一半突然想上厕所的情况。一次都没有？我真害怕。哇哦。是啊。说真的，有时候我在办公室开会，会突然起身去洗手间。我真惊讶你居然没遇到过这种情况。哇哦。
[00:26:51.610] The worst that's happened to me was like, maybe there's a meeting in two minutes and I'm like, oh, I have to go to the bathroom really badly right now. And I'm like, hopefully I can make it. But it's shocking to me that like you just get up and leave to go to the bathroom. Yeah. Are people not like, hey, what the fuck? Where is she going? I mean, no, I've seen plenty of other people go to the bathroom. Like, especially if there's a lot of back-to-back meetings, right? I don't always have time to like prep for a meeting and use the restroom.
[00:26:51.610] 最糟糕的情况就是，可能还有两分钟就要开会了，我突然想，哎呀，我急着要上厕所。然后我就想，希望我能赶上。但让我震惊的是，居然有人会起身离开去上厕所。是啊。难道没人会想，嘿，搞什么鬼？她要去哪儿？我的意思是，不，我见过很多人去上厕所。尤其是在会议一个接一个的情况下，对吧？我不可能总是有时间准备会议然后去上厕所。
[00:27:19.870] Dude, what if some of those people who are always late, it's because they have a full day of back-to-backs and they just need to go to the bathroom? Yeah, maybe. You seem skeptical. Listen, after that whole fiasco in the beginning of my career, I just go. I don't announce it. I don't type in the chat. Nothing. In all seriousness, right? I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[00:27:19.870] 哥们儿，要是那些总是迟到的人，是因为他们一整天都连着工作，只想赶紧去趟洗手间呢？嗯，也许吧。你好像有点怀疑。听着，自从我职业生涯初期那场闹剧之后，我就直接去了。我不会通知别人，也不会在聊天室里发消息。什么都不会。说真的，对吧？我觉得这没什么大不了的。
[00:27:47.850] You just leave and someone like asks you a question and you're not there. They'll just ask you later. And usually what happens is like when I'm in the meeting and they do it to someone else, they'll be like, hey, Annie, do you know this? Oh, okay. I guess Annie is busy right now. You know? That's it. I guess sometimes the thing I'll do too is like I'll maybe PM my mentor or like a friend on the team or something. Like I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick. Let me know if I missed anything.
[00:27:47.850] 你刚离开，有人问你问题，你却不在。他们只能之后再问。通常的情况是，如果我在开会，他们问别人同样的问题，他们会说：“嘿，安妮，你知道这个吗？” 哦，好的。看来安妮现在很忙。你知道吗？就这么简单。有时候我也会私信我的导师或者团队里的朋友之类的。比如，我会说：“我去趟洗手间，一会儿告诉我有没有错过什么。”
[00:28:15.790] That way, if they do ask me something, they could just be like, oh, I know she just went to the restroom. But I'll like pass it on. So there's workarounds to our little bio breaks. Oh, my God. That's also. Bio break. Like that is so peak meeting lingo. I hate it. I refuse to say bio break. I vehemently refuse to. It's so stupid. Just say bathroom. Don't be embarrassed.
[00:28:15.790] 这样，如果他们问我什么，他们就可以说，哦，我知道她刚去洗手间了。但我会转告的。所以我们的短暂休息时间也有变通的办法。我的天哪。还有，生物休息时间。这简直是会议用语的巅峰之作。我讨厌它。我拒绝说生物休息时间。我坚决拒绝。这太蠢了。直接说洗手间就行了。别觉得尴尬。
[00:28:46.390] Yeah, there's bathroom. There's restroom or bio break. But I feel like bio break is like the most commonly used phrase. Even just today to my manager ping me. She was like, hey, do you have time to chat? I'm like, yeah, let me go to the bathroom real quick. And then it was like a 30 minute like shit. Oh, my God. I'm speechless. I didn't say that. You know, I just came back. I was like, I'm back.
[00:28:46.390] 是啊，有洗手间，有厕所，也有休息时间。但我感觉“休息时间”这个词用得太频繁了。就连今天我经理都给我发消息，问我有没有空聊聊。我说，有啊，我去趟洗手间。结果就去了半个小时，真是见鬼了。我的天哪。我都不知道该说什么了。我根本没说过这话。你知道，我刚回来，就说，我回来了。
[00:29:15.230] She knows what happened. She does what happened. But we're both adults here. You know, it's not like me saying bio break would have made it any better. Dude, whenever I hear bio break, I always think like bio hazard. I feel like if someone says bio break, you assume the worst. Well, I'll test this next time. During the middle of my team meeting, I'll just get up and leave. And I'll come back one minute later and be like, sorry, I was in the bathroom.
[00:29:15.230] 她知道发生了什么。她也做了发生的事。但我们都是成年人了。你知道，就算我说“去洗手间”，情况也不会好到哪里去。老兄，我一听到“去洗手间”，脑子里就总是浮现“生物危害”之类的画面。我觉得只要有人说“去洗手间”，你就会往最坏的方面想。好吧，下次我试试。在团队会议进行到一半的时候，我就起身离开。一分钟后回来，然后说：“不好意思，我去洗手间了。”
[00:29:45.810] But the thing is like... For your bio break. For my team meetings, I always go into the office for them. So I'm just like imagining like me suddenly getting up and leaving. It's kind of shocking, you know, it seems like I stormed out in anger or something. Oh, my gosh. I mean, I don't think I think people would just assume you're going to the restroom. Like what other reason? I don't know.
[00:29:45.810] 但问题是……比如说，去上厕所。我开团队会议的时候，通常都会去办公室。所以我就想象自己突然起身离开的样子。这有点吓人，你知道吗，感觉就像我生气地冲出去了一样。天哪。我的意思是，我觉得人们不会直接认为你是去洗手间。还能有什么别的理由呢？我不知道。
[00:30:12.530] Just so it's clear, I'm storming out angrily. Like slam the door on your way. Yeah, because I think using the bathroom when you're remote is a lot easier. I just turn the camera off, mute and then go to the bathroom, then come back. Like nothing happened. But when everyone's seeing you in a meeting room and you just suddenly get up and leave, I'm like, oh, God, don't look at me. You do have to be perceived, you know, when you do that. But I've only really done that during bigger meetings, I guess,
[00:30:12.530] 说清楚点，我是气冲冲地离开的。就像摔门而去一样。是啊，因为我觉得远程办公的时候上厕所方便多了。我只要关掉摄像头，静音，然后去上厕所，再回来就行了。就好像什么都没发生过一样。但如果是在会议室里，所有人都看着你，你突然起身离开，我就想，天哪，别看我。你知道，你这么做的时候，肯定会被人注意到。不过我好像只在比较重要的会议上这么做过。
[00:30:41.930] where there's maybe like 20 people in a meeting room. So it's a little bit less scary. Yeah, I guess all my meetings are remote. I only really work from home. And so my meeting culture is a lot easier to deal with. Well, aside from like these bigger meetings, I feel like low key one on one meetings are both the hardest and the easiest. Because to me, sometimes it's the hardest because I feel like I have to fill up the empty space
[00:30:41.930] 会议室里大概有20个人，所以没那么可怕。嗯，我所有的会议都是远程的，我基本上只在家办公，所以我的会议文化也更容易适应。除了这些大型会议之外，我觉得低调的一对一会议既是最难的也是最容易的。因为对我来说，有时候它最难，是因为我感觉自己必须填补空白。
[00:31:11.010] or time a lot more. But it's also the easiest because I feel like it's easier to wrap up sometimes. I feel like I'm doing things wrong because whenever I have a meeting with my skip or my boss, I always start and end the meeting within like 15 minutes. And we like never take up the full 30 minutes.
[00:31:11.010] 或者说，需要花费更多时间。但这也是最简单的，因为我觉得这样更容易收尾。我觉得自己好像做错了什么，因为每次和上司或老板开会，我总是15分钟左右就开始和结束。我们几乎从来没用满30分钟。
[00:31:31.570] And it got so like bad that I changed my meeting with my skip into a 15 or 10 minute meeting because I didn't want. I was like, damn, I can't just take up a whole extra 15 minutes of her time on her calendar when we wrap things up in like 10 minutes. So I'm curious to know if you all run your meetings for the full 30 minutes. Like what do you talk about? It's about life, Don.
[00:31:31.570] 情况变得非常糟糕，以至于我不得不把和副手的会议改成10分钟或15分钟的短会，因为我真的不想开。我当时想，天哪，我们明明10分钟就能搞定，我怎么好意思在她日程表上多占用15分钟呢？所以我很好奇，你们的会议是不是都开满30分钟？你们都聊些什么呢？唐，都是些生活琐事。
[00:32:00.710] I will say my one-on-ones are usually with the PM, my manager, anyone else that I trap into a meeting. My manager, for instance, every time we have a meeting and she's like legit busy afterwards, then she'll stay in the very beginning. Like, hey, just so you know, Jimmy, we can't chit chat for that long. Wait, it's me. I was just about to say that's Jisoo. Yeah.
[00:32:00.710] 我通常会跟项目经理、我的经理，或者其他任何被我拉进会议的人单独开会。比如我的经理，每次我们开会，如果她之后真的很忙，她就会在会议开始的时候留下来。比如，她说：“嘿，Jimmy，我们没法闲聊那么久。”等等，那是我。我正要说那是Jisoo。对。
[00:32:31.410] And like, well, we'll usually do it. This is why she's probably three minutes late to everything because we'll still go over. And then I'm the one that stops the meeting. Like, I notice it's like three minutes over. I'm like, hold on, manager. Don't you have like a meeting right now? Oh, shoot. Yeah. Sorry. There she'll go. But yeah, usually we just chit chat a lot. So I actually do an hour long TV with my mentor and also with my manager. And it's weekly.
[00:32:31.410] 嗯，我们通常都会这么做。这就是为什么她每次都迟到三分钟的原因，因为我们总是会超时。然后我就得叫停会议。比如，我注意到已经超时三分钟了，我就说：“等等，经理，你现在不是有个会吗？” 哦，糟糕。是啊。抱歉。她又要走了。不过，我们通常只是闲聊。我每周都会和我的导师以及我的经理一起录制一个小时的电视节目。
[00:33:01.510] If I have to like divide it up, it's maybe like 15, 20 minutes of chit chat. Because it's an hour long, right? The rest is like work questions. Or sometimes I'll have like career questions of like, you know, logistical stuff. Like, what do I need to do to get promoted? Or, you know, what are some projects that you want me to work on? Things like that. So I feel like I always have a lot of questions to ask about work. And then that fills up like most of the time.
[00:33:01.510] 如果非要划分一下的话，大概有15到20分钟的闲聊时间。因为会议时长一个小时，对吧？剩下的时间都是工作方面的问题。有时候我也会问一些职业发展方面的问题，比如一些实际操作方面的问题。像，我需要做些什么才能升职？或者，你想让我参与哪些项目？诸如此类。所以我觉得我总是有很多工作方面的问题要问。然后大部分时间就都聊完了。
[00:33:27.550] Even if it's not questions, like it's a lot of status updates to on like projects of like, here's all the stuff that I did. You know, is there anything else that you need me to take on? Just like a summary of what I did behind the projects and whatnot. So I feel like there's always a good amount to talk about. But that takes like 45 minutes. A lot of questions. A lot of updates.
[00:33:27.550] 即使不是提问，比如汇报项目进展，或者说“这是我做的所有事情”，你也知道，还有什么需要我做的吗？就是总结一下项目背后的工作等等。我觉得总是有很多东西可以聊。但这就要花掉45分钟。很多问题，很多进展汇报。
[00:33:53.630] If I'm like working on one project and I need to like validate the financial model I'm using or something, it's not like a true false question, right? It's like, oh, here's like the background. Like, here's the variables I'm using, blah, blah, blah. So then I feel like that, like each thing takes like 10 minutes. And if I'm having like five or six ad hocs, that's like a good chunk already. It takes five minutes to be like, can you see my screen? Dude, can we do some role play right now?
[00:33:53.630] 如果我正在进行一个项目，需要验证我正在使用的财务模型之类的东西，那不是那种简单的判断题，对吧？而是像“哦，这是背景信息，这是我使用的变量，等等等等”。所以我觉得，每件事都要花10分钟。如果我同时要处理五六个临时问题，那就已经占用了不少时间。光是问“你能看看我的屏幕吗？哥们，我们现在能来个角色扮演吗？”就要花掉5分钟。
[00:34:23.090] Can I ask you some questions? And then you can answer them as if you're reading a one-on-one. I need to see this in action. All right, let me just go ahead. Did he turn his camera off and mute it? So everyone, how's your week going? Good. It's going good. Account for the lag.
[00:34:23.090] 我可以问你几个问题吗？然后你可以像一对一聊天一样回答。我需要看看实际操作。好的，那我先问吧。他关掉摄像头并静音了吗？大家，这周过得怎么样？很好。一切都很好。考虑到网络延迟，请见谅。
[00:34:52.570] All right, well, let's start off with Jisoo. Let me know how your projects are going this week. Yeah, so this week I've been really focusing on tackling a lot of like ad hoc requests that have come in from the sales team. So this person sent in this. I've been working on this. And then this other person sent in this request. And that really required me to like go into system A to like dig up stuff.
[00:34:52.570] 好的，那我们先从Jisoo开始吧。跟我说说你这周的项目进展如何？嗯，这周我主要在处理销售团队临时提出的各种需求。比如这个人发来了这个，我一直在处理。然后另一个人又发来了这个需求，这真的需要我去系统A里翻找资料。
[00:35:18.790] And I realized that system A doesn't have variable B. So then I had to go into system B and then like merge the data together to work on financial model A. So that's what I've been focusing on. I have some questions for you after stand up if we could like dive into it together. But yeah, that's mostly it. Whoa. Off the off the role play for a second. Yeah. Wow. You give so many details.
[00:35:18.790] 然后我发现系统 A 没有变量 B。所以我不得不进入系统 B，然后把数据合并起来，才能继续完善财务模型 A。这就是我最近一直在忙的事情。如果可以的话，我还有一些问题想问你，我们可以一起深入探讨一下。嗯，差不多就是这样了。哇。先暂停一下角色扮演。哇。你讲了好多细节啊。
[00:35:47.650] Maybe I should add that to my repertoire. Wait, Jimmy still having his camera off muted is sending me. All right. Back to the role play. Oh, that sounds really good, Jisoo. Yeah, we could connect afterwards. Just shoot me a ping or we could connect offline or put some time in my calendar. All right, Jimmy, how about you? Any updates for this week? No updates.
[00:35:47.650] 或许我应该把这个也加到我的技能库里。等等，Jimmy 的摄像头还关着没开，声音也静音了，真是让我哭笑不得。好吧。继续角色扮演。哦，听起来真不错，Jisoo。嗯，之后我们可以联系。给我发个消息，或者我们可以线下联系，或者在我的日历上安排一下时间。好的，Jimmy，你呢？这周有什么新进展吗？没有。
[00:36:17.310] Not even a thank you. Pretty realistic. No updates is crazy. Oh my God. Okay, I see now. Jisoo, you give very good and like exciting detail. Well, it's funny that you say that because when we do like our like team stand up or whatever, I feel like I talk the least. Oh, wow.
[00:36:17.310] 连句谢谢都没有。挺现实的。一点消息都没有，太离谱了。我的天。好吧，我明白了。Jisoo，你提供的细节很棒，也很精彩。嗯，你说得真有意思，因为我们团队开会什么的，我感觉自己说话最少。哦，哇。
[00:36:44.030] I always felt like I was giving really like, I don't know, not brief, but maybe I just didn't have a lot to talk about or something. So I'm shocked that you're like, oh, you say so much. Dude, I say I say something between Jimmy and you. It's like black and white. When you were going, Jisoo, I felt intimidated. I felt like a slacker with my camera off. Dude. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:36:44.030] 我一直觉得我说话特别简短，不知道该怎么说，可能只是没什么可说的吧。所以你居然说“哦，你说了这么多”，我真是太惊讶了。哥们儿，我说的都是你和Jimmy之间的事，分明就是黑白分明。你说话的时候，Jisoo，我感觉有点儿紧张。感觉自己像个偷懒的家伙，连摄像头都没开。哥们儿。是啊。是啊。
[00:37:13.930] I mean, this is only when I have updates. Like sometimes I don't have an update. So I'll just be like, I don't, I don't have much to say. Wait, so if you have no updates and you have an hour long meeting with your manager, are you just like, oh, like not much is going on. We can end early today. You know, we just did like a group stand up. Yeah. Like in my one on one, I go even more in depth. Like we fucking like go through my projects and I'm like, can you like look at these or
[00:37:13.930] 我的意思是，只有当我有进展汇报的时候才会这样。有时候我其实没什么进展汇报。所以我就会说，我没什么，没什么好说的。等等，所以如果你没有进展汇报，而你又要和你的经理开一个小时的会，你会不会就说，哦，好像没什么事儿。我们今天可以提前结束了。你知道，我们刚才开了个集体站会。是的。就像在我的单独谈话中，我会更深入地讨论。比如我们会一起查看我的项目，我会说，你能看看这些吗？
[00:37:41.670] like here's the thing that I added to this type of report. Like, do you think this would be useful? I'll make recommendations or like, I don't know. So I think I almost always do take the full hour, although there are times where we'll only end in like 30 minutes and we'll be like, ha ha ha. We'll catch up next time. Okay. I feel like, okay, because my like team meeting updates are very similar with my manager. Cause I'm like, oh, I said like everything I really needed to say yesterday at our team meeting.
[00:37:41.670] 比如，这是我在这类报告里添加的内容。比如，你觉得这有用吗？我会提些建议，或者，我也不知道。所以我觉得我几乎总是会用满一个小时，虽然有时候我们可能只用了30分钟就结束了，然后我们就会说，哈哈，下次再聊。好吧。我觉得，好吧，因为我跟经理汇报的团队会议情况很相似。因为我会说，哦，我昨天在团队会议上已经把所有我想说的都说完了。
[00:38:11.070] So my updates go something like, yeah, I have like project A and it's going well. It's on track. Like project B is also looking good. The stakeholder is pretty excited about it and project C we just wrapped up and they're really happy about it. Oh, interesting. I guess I see my TVs as like, I mean, right now I'm kind of more so learning or like trying to understand or like take on more responsibilities. So I think that's a big part of it.
[00:38:11.070] 所以我的汇报大概是这样的：嗯，A项目进展顺利，一切都在按计划进行。B项目看起来也不错，利益相关者对它非常兴奋。C项目我们刚刚完成，他们也很满意。哦，有意思。我觉得我现在的工作状态就像是，嗯，我现在更多的是在学习，或者说是在努力理解，或者说是在承担更多的责任。所以我觉得这很重要。
[00:38:37.070] But in my past life, because I was at a managerial role, I was having TVs with my boss who was like a VP, right? I needed my VP to know stuff that I knew so that in his meetings with leadership, he could like talk about the things that our team was doing. So then I think that in itself like took a long time too. Hmm. The only times where I didn't have a ton to update on was like weeks where I was like really slacking or something because I feel like with my personality, if I did something
[00:38:37.070] 但以前，因为我担任管理职位，我和我的老板（他大概是副总裁）会通过电视进行沟通，对吧？我需要让我的副总裁了解我所知道的事情，这样他在与领导层开会时才能谈论我们团队的工作进展。所以我觉得这本身也花了不少时间。嗯。只有在我特别懈怠的那几周，我才没什么可汇报的，因为我觉得以我的性格，如果我做了什么……
[00:39:06.110] like I'll tell you about it. So if I don't have updates, then maybe I didn't do much that week. Just the way I approach meetings. I see. I see. How about you, Jimmy? Do you like go in depth into your projects with your manager or are you just kind of like me? You're like, all right. Yeah. These are going well on track. There's like a handful of projects I actually care about and I'll go like in depth on it. But most of the time, yeah, the updates, they already know what's going on, especially if
[00:39:06.110] 就像我会跟你讲的那样。所以如果我没有汇报，那可能就是我那周没做什么事。这就是我开会的方式。我明白了。我明白了。吉米，你呢？你会跟你的经理深入讨论你的项目吗？还是像我一样，就说“好的，是的，这些项目进展顺利”。我真正关心的项目也就那么几个，我会深入讨论。但大多数时候，是的，汇报的内容他们已经知道发生了什么，尤其是在……
[00:39:34.090] they're like asking for an update, then they're probably already like, you know, either tagged in the email thread or, you know, we're already talking about it. Aside from a one-on-one, we're just like, hey, do you have time to chat about this? For those, usually an update isn't really necessary. But yeah, I guess for my projects, I'll have updates and I'll let her know like how that business unit is doing, the latest news and whatnot. And then also I'll be like, look at the deck that I made and then you'll have all your answers.
[00:39:34.090] 他们好像在问进展情况，但可能已经有人在邮件里提到过，或者我们已经在讨论这件事了。除了单独沟通之外，我们通常只会问：“嘿，你有时间聊聊这个吗？” 对于这种情况，通常不需要汇报进展。但是，对于我的项目，我会汇报进展，告诉她那个业务部门的情况、最新消息等等。然后我还会说：“看看我做的演示文稿，里面应该有所有问题的答案。”
[00:40:07.310] You're invited to the meeting if you want to join. Yeah, I guess maybe it's also like the way my smaller team is structured because we have this project tracker that everyone can see. And my manager sees everything that comes in and then she assigns it and stuff. So it's like you can see the same description that I see. So there's no questions. Everything is pretty straightforward. I'm working through it kind of thing.
[00:40:07.310] 如果你想参加，欢迎加入会议。嗯，我想这可能也跟我们小团队的组织结构有关，因为我们有一个项目跟踪表，所有人都能看到。我的经理可以看到所有项目，然后她会分配任务等等。所以你看到的描述跟我看到的一样。因此不会有任何疑问。一切都很清晰明了。我正在处理这些事情。
[00:40:36.230] But I feel like I want to take up more time instead of like finishing it so quickly. Because sometimes the thought is almost like, oh, maybe I like don't even leave an impression in this person's day. Damn. It just broke Jimmy's heart. I visibly saw it break. Because sometimes my thought is like they have no idea what I'm working on because I described it so quickly and simply.
[00:40:36.230] 但我感觉我应该花更多时间，而不是这么快就完成。因为有时候我会想，哦，也许我根本没给这个人留下任何印象。该死。这让吉米心碎了。我亲眼看到他心碎的样子。因为有时候我会想，他们根本不知道我在做什么，因为我描述得太快太简单了。
[00:41:06.430] And so instead of describing something so like quickly and like skip over me quickly, it's like, oh, I feel like I understand more of what's happening here. So I feel almost like I have a bigger stake in knowing if this thing goes to completion or whatever. I mean, you never know because as I'm talking to you guys, I feel like we're on like a spectrum of like our meeting philosophies.
[00:41:06.430] 所以，与其匆匆描述一番就略过我，不如这样，感觉自己对这里发生的事情有了更深的理解。因此，我觉得自己更关心这件事能否完成。我的意思是，谁也说不准，因为在和你们交谈的过程中，我觉得我们似乎处于一种会议理念的光谱上。
[00:41:31.330] I know there's execs out there who are like, oh, my God, thank God this person is taking up like an efficient amount of time in my meeting schedule. That's already so busy. So I feel like there's a happy medium in here somewhere of like, I cut down my meetings and then you like inflate yours a little bit. And like Jimmy turns his camera on or something. And we like all happily meet somewhere in the middle of the Venn diagram. But, you know, I think being brief and like concise isn't inherently like a bad thing.
[00:41:31.330] 我知道有些高管会想：“天哪，谢天谢地，这个人占用了我会议日程中相当高效的时间。我的日程已经够满了。” 所以我觉得这里面应该有个折中的办法，比如我减少自己的会议，你稍微增加一下你的会议时长。然后吉米打开摄像头什么的。这样我们大家都能愉快地在维恩图的中间找到一个平衡点。但是，你知道，我认为简洁明了本身并不是坏事。
[00:42:01.450] Hopefully. I think as long as you get the job done. I mean, what Jisoo said actually reminds me of like a funny story where I have product watch, which is like a really regular thing for me. I have to make a deck for it. It used to be every two weeks notes, every month. And then one month, I just forgot to do it. And like an hour before the meeting, I was trying like really hard to like do it. I was only able, it's like two business units that I have to report on.
[00:42:01.450] 希望如此。我觉得只要你能把工作做好就行。我是说，Jisoo说的让我想起一件挺搞笑的事儿，我得定期做产品观察报告。以前是每两周一次，或者每个月一次。结果有一次，我竟然忘了做。会议开始前一个小时，我拼命想赶紧补上。结果只来得及，因为我只需要汇报两个业务部门的情况。
[00:42:31.650] And I was only able to do one business unit. And I remember specifically in that meeting, I called on people that I knew took a lot of time. And so I would like call them and be like, what do you think about this, Bill? You're like, that's 20 minutes for a thing. Yeah. I was like, yes, Bill, keep going. You're like, oh, could you elaborate on that? I didn't quite get the part that you just said. Oh my God.
[00:42:31.650] 我当时只负责一个业务部门。我特别记得在那次会议上，我点名问了一些我知道很费时间的人。我就给他们打电话，问他们：“比尔，你觉得这个怎么样？” 你会说：“就这么点事儿，得花二十分钟。” 我说：“是啊，比尔，继续。” 你会说：“哦，你能详细说说吗？我没太听懂你刚才说的。” 我的天哪。
[00:43:01.190] I mean, hopefully it wasn't that obvious because it's like Bill would be talking and then Ryan, I know he has questions about it, right? And so like, right. What do you think about that? We didn't even get through the first business unit. And I was like, oh my God. That is so funny. It was the first time after the meeting where I specifically didn't say, okay, I'll send the slide deck to you guys afterwards, you know?
[00:43:01.190] 我的意思是，希望这没那么明显，因为就像比尔在说话，然后瑞恩，我知道他肯定会问问题，对吧？所以，就是这样。你觉得怎么样？我们甚至还没讲完第一个业务单元。我当时就想，我的天哪。这太搞笑了。这是会后我第一次特意没说“好的，我之后会把幻灯片发给你们”，你知道吗？
[00:43:32.310] That's genius though. It was pretty nice. It's the directors, by the way. The directors usually like talking a lot. But I noticed whenever I'm leading these meetings, they always latch onto one thing and then they just want to spend the entire time talking about it, you know? Dude. Yes. I've noticed that too. It's like this one number or like this one percentage. They're like, where did you get this number? And then suddenly that question becomes like a 30 minute meeting.
[00:43:32.310] 这真是个绝妙的主意。挺不错的。顺便说一句，是导演们。导演们通常都很爱说话。但我注意到，每次我主持这些会议时，他们总是会抓住一个点不放，然后就想把整个会议时间都花在这个点上，你知道吗？哥们儿，没错。我也注意到了。比如某个数字或者某个百分比。他们会问，这个数字你是从哪儿算出来的？然后这个问题就突然变成了一个长达30分钟的会议。
[00:44:02.510] Yeah. The whole entire. Exactly. So you just like slip if, if you don't finish your slides, you know, then just like slip in like some inflammatory number that you know is going to get everyone stirred up. Here are the real workplace tips. I like the strategy. Yeah. This month we've had very like an uptick in negative VOCs. Oh shit. They're like, I heard negative.
[00:44:02.510] 对，整个过程。没错。所以，如果你没讲完幻灯片，你知道，那就随便塞进一些煽动性的数据，你知道这会激起大家的情绪。这才是真正的职场秘诀。我喜欢这个策略。是的。这个月我们收到的负面反馈明显增多。哦，糟糕。他们会说，我听到了负面反馈。
[00:44:33.530] Like, yeah, genetic was really upset about this. Well, it's so funny to talk through this kind of stuff because these are things that happen in a meeting that aren't always positive. For example, someone taking one number, running with it and taking up like your entire meeting time or not feeling like you're super prepared for a meeting. But I think talking to you guys, it makes me realize that we can use these things that
[00:44:33.530] 是啊，基因检测那边对此非常不满。其实讨论这些事挺有意思的，因为会议中确实会发生一些不太积极的事情。比如，有人抓住一个数字就大做文章，占用了你整个会议时间，或者感觉自己没有为会议做好充分准备。但我觉得和你们聊过之后，我意识到我们可以利用这些事情……
[00:45:01.230] happen in meetings to our benefit and to our advantage. So thank you, Jimmy and Crystal for talking through some of the meeting culture and meeting etiquette things with me today.
