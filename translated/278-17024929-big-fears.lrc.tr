[00:00:00.270] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. Okay, this is kind of unrelated to everything, but I feel like in our past maybe like three episodes, I sound sick in them.
[00:00:00.270] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。好吧，这跟主题有点无关，但我感觉在过去的几期节目里，我的声音听起来好像不太对劲。
[00:00:27.670] And I just thought that was a funny coincidence. Just happens to be whenever we record, I'm a little congested. Crystal's not being honest with you guys. This is her new voice. It's just stuck like this forever. Oh God, I hope not. Actually, that could be a pretty decent transition into our real topic this week, which is big fears. We thought it would be kind of funny to do an episode dedicated to irrational fears.
[00:00:27.670] 我觉得这真是个有趣的巧合。每次录音的时候，我都会有点鼻塞。Crystal没跟你们说实话。这是她新的声音。好像永远都变了。天哪，但愿不是。其实，这倒是个不错的过渡，可以引出我们本周的真正话题——巨大的恐惧。我们觉得做一期专门聊非理性恐惧的节目应该挺有意思的。
[00:00:57.190] We're going to keep these fears to be like kind of out of the ordinary fears today. So not social anxiety or interpersonal relationships or fears about worthiness, that kind of stuff. These are like, I'm scared of the dark. I'm scared of getting murdered. Those kinds of fears. And all valid fears, I hope people can agree. Out of the ordinary, but very normal and valid. Yes, yes. Honestly, I'm still scared of the dark in some aspects.
[00:00:57.190] 我们今天要讨论的恐惧都比较特殊，不是社交焦虑、人际关系问题或者自我价值感缺失之类的。而是像“我怕黑”、“我怕被谋杀”之类的恐惧。这些都是合理的恐惧，我希望大家都能认同。虽然特殊，但非常正常，也很有道理。是的，没错。说实话，在某些方面，我仍然怕黑。
[00:01:26.750] I think it actually took me a while to like stop sleeping with a nightlight. I think the dark plus additional fears, it like multiplies the fear factor. True. So an example could be like, currently I live alone. So sometimes when it's just all dark and you're just by yourself, it's like, oh God, anything could be in this dark. We need some light here. It's kind of funny because it's like, would that really help if things came down to it?
[00:01:26.750] 我觉得我花了好长时间才摆脱开夜灯睡觉的习惯。我觉得黑暗加上恐惧，会成倍放大恐惧感。确实如此。举个例子，我现在一个人住。所以有时候，当周围一片漆黑，只有你一个人的时候，就会想，天哪，这黑暗里什么都有可能。我们需要点光。这其实挺讽刺的，因为你会想，如果真到了那一步，点光真的有用吗？
[00:01:56.670] I saw a Reddit thread that talked about the fear of the dark actually. And I, like you, usually keep a nightlight on. And it took me a really long time to like get used to sleeping with it off. Right. And I was reading a thread about that phenomenon. And someone was like, you know, when it came down to it, if an intruder came into your house and you guys were kind of battling out a hide and seek in the dark, you would have the advantage because you know what your house looks like.
[00:01:56.670] 我之前在Reddit上看到一个帖子，讨论的是害怕黑暗的问题。我和你一样，平时睡觉都会开着夜灯。我花了很长时间才习惯关掉夜灯睡觉。没错。我当时正在看一个关于这种现象的帖子。有人说，如果真到了那种地步，有个入侵者闯进你家，你们俩在黑暗中玩捉迷藏，你会占上风，因为你知道你家是什么样子。
[00:02:23.630] And the intruder would need the light to kind of gauge what the layout looks like. And I was like, damn, I guess it's true, but it doesn't make it any less scary. Yeah. I don't know. Because you could hide still. And if they have a light, they'll probably try to check everything. Unless maybe you can fit in like the cupboard. Yeah, I guess the hope would be like if the light was off, you might know some of the nicks and crannies of your house that the intruder would not know. But I don't know.
[00:02:23.630] 入侵者需要灯光来大致了解房屋的布局。我当时就想，哎，好像是真的，但这并不能减轻恐惧感。是啊，我也不知道。因为你还是可以躲起来的。如果他们开了灯，他们可能会把所有地方都检查一遍。除非你能钻进橱柜里。是啊，我想，如果灯关了，你可能知道一些入侵者不知道的房屋角落和缝隙。但我也不确定。
[00:02:51.730] I feel like they would have a flashlight anyway. Yeah. I guess maybe you could hide somewhere and like trip them. But then like if you're in a nook and cranny, like it's going to take a second to get out of that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like some home alone type of. But do you think that is a big part of your fear of the dark? Potential home invasion or like someone in the house? Or are there other things associated with it? Okay, this is kind of stupid.
[00:02:51.730] 我觉得他们反正都会带手电筒的。是啊。我想也许你可以躲在某个地方绊他们一下。但如果你躲在某个犄角旮旯里，那出来得花点时间。是啊，是啊。就像《小鬼当家》那种感觉。但你觉得这是你害怕黑暗的主要原因吗？害怕有人闯入你的家，或者害怕家里有人？还是还有其他原因？好吧，这个问题有点傻。
[00:03:19.370] But yes, part of it is, you know, the unknown. Like what if someone's lurking in the dark that you aren't aware of? But then another part is like supernatural shit. You know, what if there's ghosts or weird, unexplainable things going on? I don't know. It's just worse in the dark. Yeah, I guess that's true. I wonder if we were kind of conditioned to this kind of stuff. Because most horror movies that we watch growing up, all the bad shit happens in the dark. Exactly.
[00:03:19.370] 没错，一部分原因是未知。比如，万一黑暗中潜伏着你没察觉的人呢？另一部分原因则是超自然现象。你知道，万一有鬼魂或者其他无法解释的怪事发生呢？我不知道。反正黑暗中总是更可怕。嗯，我想确实如此。我在想，我们是不是从小就被灌输了这种观念。因为我们小时候看的恐怖电影里，所有糟糕的事情都发生在黑暗中。没错。
[00:03:49.610] What is it like the devil's hour from like The Conjuring or something? It's like 2am. And I'm like, shit, that's like when I'm awake sometimes. Yeah, supernatural stuff is definitely a little scary. For me, I think my fear of the supernatural is directly correlated to how much supernatural content I'm consuming. If I haven't read spooky ghost stories or watched like a horror movie or something in a while,
[00:03:49.610] 感觉就像《招魂》里的“魔鬼时刻”一样？大概凌晨两点吧。然后我就想，糟了，有时候我醒着的时间也差不多就是这个。没错，超自然的东西确实有点吓人。对我来说，我觉得我对超自然的恐惧和我接触超自然内容的多少直接相关。如果我有一段时间没读过恐怖鬼故事或者看过恐怖电影之类的，
[00:04:16.370] it's like bottom of the queue of my fears, you know? I'm probably more scared of, I don't know, taxes or fucking other real life stuff going on. But there will be times where I'll like binge a bunch of horror movies back to back. Yeah. And then I start to get a little bit freaked out. Okay. And also you like love horror movies. So this is like not adding up for me. I think I enjoy the fear. It's like controlled fear. You know what I mean? Is it though?
[00:04:16.370] 你知道吗？这感觉就像是我所有恐惧中最不重要的。我可能更害怕，比如说，税或者其他一些乱七八糟的现实生活琐事。但有时候，我会一口气看好几部恐怖电影。是啊。然后我就开始有点害怕。好吧。而且你也喜欢恐怖电影。所以这对我来说有点说不通。我觉得我挺享受那种恐惧的。就像是可控的恐惧。你明白我的意思吗？真的是这样吗？
[00:04:44.990] It's like, it's kind of like how people like going on roller coasters. The theory is a lot of people have a fear of falling off a cliff. But if you do it in a controlled way where you're strapped onto like metal, maybe you feel like you have control over the fear. I can see that. But then like after a horror movie, do you not like go home and then spiral in thought and then it becomes much bigger and no longer controlled?
[00:04:44.990] 这就像人们喜欢坐过山车一样。理论上来说，很多人都害怕从悬崖上掉下去。但如果你以一种可控的方式去体验，比如被安全带绑在金属上，你或许会觉得你能控制这种恐惧。我能理解。但是，就像看完恐怖电影后，你回家后会不会胡思乱想，然后这种恐惧感变得更加强烈，最终失控呢？
[00:05:12.810] I do get the feeling where, you know, like after a horror movie, you're like walking down your hallway or something. Yeah. And then you briefly hesitate and then you like sprint towards your bed. Like I do get that. But I think I kind of enjoy that thrill. What? Okay, I see. I mean, I don't know. I think fear is kind of to an extent, it's enjoyable. And that's why people are attracted to this stuff, right? It's like a rush. Maybe.
[00:05:12.810] 我确实有那种感觉，你知道，就像看完恐怖电影后，你走在走廊里什么的。对。然后你会短暂地犹豫一下，接着就冲向床。我懂那种感觉。但我认为我挺享受那种刺激的。什么？好吧，我明白了。我的意思是，我不知道。我觉得恐惧在某种程度上是令人愉悦的。这就是为什么人们会被这类东西吸引，对吧？就像一种快感。也许吧。
[00:05:40.750] Regarding these kinds of, you know, thrillers, honestly, even if it's not supernatural, sometimes freaks me out too. Because I'm the type to like go home, really think about this movie or show that I just watched. And then I start applying it to my life. Like, oh my God, what if I were in that situation? And I'm like, oh God, what if something like that were to happen? And next thing you know, my room is haunted. It's not safe in here. Okay, I actually have an example. And this one's not supernatural.
[00:05:40.750] 说实话，这类惊悚片，就算不是超自然题材，有时候也会把我吓得魂飞魄散。因为我是那种看完电影或剧集回家后会仔细琢磨的人。然后我会把剧情套用到自己的生活中。比如，天哪，如果我身处那种境地会怎样？我会想，天哪，如果真发生了那种事怎么办？然后，说不定哪天我就觉得我的房间闹鬼了，这里不安全。好吧，我其实有个例子。而且这个例子跟超自然无关。
[00:06:10.850] When I was, maybe I was in junior high or high school, I watched the movie A Beautiful Mind, which deals with schizophrenia. And I think this was like the first time I really saw like an example of schizophrenia in media. So it really freaked me out. I went back to bed that night and I like thought about it a lot. I was like, oh my God, this disease is like crazy. It made this guy do all these crazy things. And it was all just in his head.
[00:06:10.850] 我大概还在上初中或高中的时候，看过一部叫《美丽心灵》的电影，讲的是精神分裂症。我想这应该是我第一次在媒体上真正看到精神分裂症的例子。所以它真的吓到我了。那天晚上我回到床上，一直在想这部电影。我当时想，我的天哪，这种病简直太疯狂了。它让这个人做了那么多疯狂的事情。而这一切都只是他自己臆想出来的。
[00:06:40.590] I started thinking like, oh my God, what if I have schizophrenia? But I just don't know. And you wouldn't know because it's all real to you. And so I literally couldn't sleep for like three days. I know, I can definitely relate to that. Like there are certain things that just trigger like a specific type of fear. It's not like enjoyable. It's just like I straight up spiral for multiple days. So that kind of stuff I don't touch.
[00:06:40.590] 我开始想，天哪，万一我得了精神分裂症怎么办？但我真的不知道。你也不会知道，因为这一切对你来说都是真实的。所以我整整三天都睡不着觉。我知道，我完全能理解你的感受。有些事情会触发某种特定的恐惧。那感觉一点也不好受。我会直接陷入情绪漩涡，持续好几天。所以，那种事我绝对不会碰。
[00:07:05.290] And I think maybe that's why I enjoy being scared of things that feel a little bit less real to me. For example, I think I've shared on this podcast before, but the concept of infinite death is like extremely scary to me. So if I think about that for more than like 30 seconds, I start to feel really lightheaded. And then I have to do grounding techniques of like five things you can touch, four things you can see. Oh no. So then content about that,
[00:07:05.290] 我想，或许这就是为什么我喜欢害怕那些对我来说有点不太真实的事物。比如，我之前在这个播客里也提到过，无限死亡的概念对我来说极其可怕。如果我思考这个问题超过30秒，我就会开始感到头晕目眩。然后我就得做一些自我调节的练习，比如想五件可以触摸的东西，四件可以看见的东西。哦，天哪。所以，关于这方面的内容，
[00:07:32.950] content about like deep spirituality and like reincarnation and stuff like I can't do. However, things like ghosties and like, you know, home invasions, that stuff I do kind of enjoy consuming. So maybe it's about picking your battles. I see. What battle can you win? So you're like, wow, ghosts means not infinite death. I can handle this. Yeah. I can handle a scary visual. I can't handle absence of life, you know?
[00:07:32.950] 关于深奥的灵性、轮回之类的东西，我接受不了。但是像鬼魂、入室盗窃之类的，我就挺喜欢看的。所以，也许关键在于有所取舍。我明白了。你能接受什么样的挑战呢？比如你会想，哇，鬼魂意味着不会永远死去。我可以接受。是啊，我可以接受恐怖的画面。但我接受不了生命的消逝，你知道吗？
[00:08:02.550] Okay. Dude, but like, don't you ever close your eyes and that scary visual comes up and then you're like, dude, this is not good. I'm not safe with my eyes open or with my eyes closed. No, I mean, maybe it's because I don't live alone. I don't know. Oh, ghost stuff. Supernatural things. Movies with jump scares, I think affect me less psychologically. I've trained that, you know, like a muscle. But I still do get really scared if I listen to too much true crime stuff.
[00:08:02.550] 好吧。哥们儿，你有没有过这种经历：闭上眼睛，脑子里突然冒出可怕的画面，然后你就想，老兄，这可不好。睁着眼闭着眼都不安全。不，我是说，也许是因为我不是一个人住吧。我也不知道。哦，鬼魂之类的东西。超自然的东西。电影里那些突然吓人的桥段，我觉得对我的心理影响比较小。我已经练过这方面了，就像锻炼肌肉一样。不过，如果我听太多真实犯罪故事，我还是会很害怕。
[00:08:31.890] Because that's like pretty real. Yeah. And sometimes it's like close to home or like you can easily imagine like, oh, this one girl was walking through her neighborhood. And you're like, dude, I live in a neighborhood. Okay. That is fair. And I think to your point of living with someone else, you're right. That does help a bit. But when I was living with my parents, I think it was a little better, but they're still in a different bedroom.
[00:08:31.890] 因为那真的很真实。是啊。有时候就发生在身边，或者很容易想象，比如，一个女孩在她家附近走来走去。然后你就会想，哥们儿，我也住在一个社区里。好吧。这很合理。我觉得你说的和别人合住这一点是对的。那确实有点帮助。但我以前和父母住在一起的时候，我觉得情况稍微好一些，不过他们还是住在另一个房间。
[00:09:00.710] So things could happen isolated in my bedroom, you know? Evil things could be going on. That's true. But I totally agree with true crime being really scary. There was this one book that I read, I think in college, I'll Be Gone in the Dark. And I remember, Jisoo, you also told me in college, you're like, oh, I like to read true crime books sometimes. There were like a lot of good reviews about this book. So I read it. And then I was like, Jisoo, you should read it. It's pretty good.
[00:09:00.710] 所以，你知道吗？就在我的卧室里，可能会发生一些奇怪的事情。一些邪恶的事情可能会发生。没错。但我完全同意，真实犯罪题材的书确实很吓人。我记得大学的时候读过一本书，叫《我将消失在黑暗中》。我记得，智秀，你大学的时候也跟我说过，你说，哦，我有时候喜欢读真实犯罪题材的书。这本书评价很好。所以我读了。然后我就跟智秀说，你也应该读读。这本书很不错。
[00:09:28.690] But I remember I said something like, but I've only been reading in the daytime because it's kind of scary because it's like in California and we're in California right now. Yeah. Yeah. I almost feel like to consume stuff like true crime, I prefer if it was like in a different continent or something. Like when it's in the US, it's a little too close to home. Yeah. What if it was in the US, but like on the East Coast? I guess that's okay. Or it has to be like a different type of environment. Okay. Currently I'm in the suburbs.
[00:09:28.690] 但我记得我说过，我只在白天看书，因为有点吓人，毕竟故事发生在加州，而我们现在就在加州。是啊，是啊。我感觉，如果要看犯罪纪实类的，我更喜欢发生在其他大洲之类的。如果故事发生在美国，就感觉离家太近了。是啊。如果故事发生在美国，比如东海岸呢？我想那样应该可以。或者必须是另一种环境。好吧。我现在住在郊区。
[00:09:59.050] Right. So then maybe if it's in a city or something or like somewhere really, really rural, I'm like, okay, this is a little bit removed. But so many true crime events happen in the suburbs and it's pretty scary. I mean, I guess it makes sense. Like suburbs, you have space for your tools and like you have cars, you have everything you need, I guess. There's less eyes maybe. Oh, true. Yeah.
[00:09:59.050] 对。所以，如果案发地点在城市里，或者像那种非常非常偏远的乡村地区，我就会想，好吧，这有点儿离得远了。但是很多真实的犯罪事件都发生在郊区，这真的很可怕。我的意思是，我想这也能解释得通。比如在郊区，你有地方放工具，有车，你需要的一切都有，我想。可能因为那里人少吧。哦，确实。是的。
[00:10:27.090] And there's more like forests, pieces of nature around. That's very true. And I don't know, I think to an extent I used to delude myself because I would read true crime on threads. So like I would read like Korean true crime or like, you know, little bite-sized stories that depict what happened. Yeah. And then people would have short and sweet analysis about it. And I would read that and be like, I'm reading this because it's going to help me.
[00:10:27.090] 而且周围还有更多像森林之类的自然景观。确实如此。我不知道，我觉得我以前在某种程度上是在自欺欺人，因为我会在网上看一些真实犯罪故事。比如我会看韩国的真实犯罪故事，或者那种描述事件经过的短篇故事。是的。然后人们会对这些故事进行简短精辟的分析。我读完之后会想，我读这些是为了帮助我。
[00:10:55.490] This info will come in handy in the future. But I think it didn't really. Like all it did was heighten my sense of fear and maybe I became like more aware as a person. But I think it just like really freaked me out. I don't know. There's this one story that really freaked me out as a kid. To this day, I'm not sure if it was real or not. But the gist of the story is that there's this Korean student walking home after class and it's really late.
[00:10:55.490] 这些信息以后或许有用。但我觉得其实并没有。它只是加剧了我的恐惧感，也许让我变得更加警觉了。但我觉得它真的把我吓坏了。我也不知道。小时候有个故事真的把我吓坏了。直到今天，我也不确定它是真是假。故事大概是这样的：有个韩国学生放学后很晚了，独自走在回家的路上。
[00:11:22.590] She like senses a really scary guy walking close behind her and he follows her into the elevator of her apartment. So she's like hella scared, right? And she's like, I'm going to try to make conversation with him or something. Maybe it's not that bad. She like attempts it, but there's no small talk. So in the elevator, she's like, okay, I'm just going to try to get home as fast as possible. So she hits floor 16 and then he goes and hits 15. And she's like, oh, thank God, at least he hit a floor.
[00:11:22.590] 她感觉有个很吓人的男人跟在她身后，然后他跟着她进了公寓的电梯。她当时吓坏了，对吧？她心想，我得试着跟他聊聊天什么的。也许没那么糟糕。她试了试，但根本没法闲聊。在电梯里，她心想，好吧，我还是赶紧回家吧。电梯到了16楼，然后他又去了15楼。她心想，谢天谢地，至少他到了一层楼。
[00:11:51.450] Like he's not just trying to follow me home. They get to floor 15. The doors open. He heads out and then he turns around and she sees a knife in his pocket or something. And then he starts sprinting upstairs. I think at the time, like you couldn't unclick elevators or something. So she's just waiting that next 20 seconds just in fear, you know? So that story never left me. And to this day, whenever I'm in an elevator, like especially in Korea at like nighttime or something,
[00:11:51.450] 他好像不只是想跟踪我回家。他们到了15楼。电梯门开了。他走了出去，然后转过身，她看到他口袋里好像有把刀之类的东西。然后他就开始往楼上跑。我想当时好像电梯门是关不上的。所以她接下来的20秒都提心吊胆地等着，你知道吗？这件事我一直记着。直到今天，每当我坐电梯的时候，尤其是在韩国的晚上，我都会想起这件事。
[00:12:20.670] I'm like always looking like where people are clicking. You're like, you better not choose the floor right under me. And it's like stuff like that. That's like a bite-sized story that I feel like really sticks with you. That is pretty creepy. Wait, sorry. You look so scared. Sorry. I'm just like envisioning it happen. Like what would you do? You like can't do anything. I guess you would have to hit the like... Oh, emergency stop? Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:20.670] 我总是忍不住去看别人在点什么。你会想，最好别点我脚下的地板。诸如此类的事情。我觉得这就像一个很短小的故事，但会让你印象深刻。这确实有点吓人。等等，不好意思。你看上去好害怕。抱歉。我只是在想象那场景。你会怎么办？你什么都做不了。我想你只能按下……哦，紧急停止按钮？对，对。
[00:12:50.990] And just hope for the best. Okay, that's fair. You're like stuck there. They're waiting. And then you can call the police from the elevator. Yeah. That feels better. It's like it's just a normal guy. He like has some packages to open or something. Yeah, these like realistic scary stories always have an extra layer of scariness to them, I think. Just because it's like more plausible.
[00:12:50.990] 只能祈祷一切顺利了。好吧，这很公平。你就像被困在那儿一样。他们在等着呢。然后你可以从电梯里报警。对，这样感觉好多了。就好像他只是个普通人，可能只是要拆几个包裹什么的。是啊，我觉得这种写实的恐怖故事总是会多一层恐怖感，因为它更合情理。
[00:13:15.810] But I do think that maybe some stories have helped without us even realizing. Okay, I think there's also this pretty famous creepy story. And I'm sure you know it because I think it's from Reddit No Sleep. Some dude's driving along this road at night and he's like both sides is just like forest. He sees like a hurt person or something on the side of the road and then he stops.
[00:13:15.810] 但我确实觉得，有些故事或许在不知不觉中帮到了我们。对了，我想还有一个挺有名的恐怖故事。我相信你们肯定知道，因为我记得它好像出自Reddit的“不眠之夜”（No Sleep）版块。故事讲的是，一个家伙晚上开车沿着一条路走，路两边都是森林。他看到路边好像有个受伤的人，然后就停了下来。
[00:13:41.450] And then like all these people start coming out from like the forest or something. Right? Yeah. And then from that I learned, yeah, you should like not get out of your car in such situations. True. Honestly, that's like an actual safety concern. Yeah. Especially if you're like just a girl and it's like hella dark. I guess I would be like remove yourself from the situation and then call 911 or something.
[00:13:41.450] 然后就像突然冒出好多人，好像是从森林里什么的出来似的。对吧？嗯。然后我就明白了，在这种情况下最好不要下车。没错。说真的，这确实是个安全隐患。对。尤其如果你是个女生，而且周围又黑又亮。我觉得你应该赶紧离开那个地方，然后打911什么的。
[00:14:08.930] But yeah, it's so funny that you bring up that story because I have this distinct memory where I used to go like stargazing with one of my close friends. And we would obviously go at nighttime because that's when you can see the most stars. And the like drive up the mountain is hella scary. So then I would always tell her scary stories that I knew including that one. There's like a cult that lives in the forest. So like blah, blah, blah. And I just remember like we were like screaming like driving up the mountain. Why?
[00:14:08.930] 是啊，你提起这个故事真是太逗了，因为我清楚地记得以前我和一个好朋友一起去看星星。我们当然是晚上去，因为晚上能看到最多的星星。开车上山的路超级吓人。所以我总是给她讲我知道的恐怖故事，其中就包括这个。故事里说森林里住着一个邪教组织。诸如此类。我只记得我们一路尖叫着上山。为什么？
[00:14:38.130] You're just trying to see some stars and you're like, dude, guess what? But, you know, I have to say when it's dark, I just have this urge to like open my treasure box of scary stories. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There's also another famous one. The one where the girl's driving home and then there's a car following her and she's freaking out a little bit. But the car keeps like high beaming her randomly. And she's like, what the fuck? She finally gets home. The car has followed her the whole way.
[00:14:38.130] 你只是想看看星星，然后你就想，老兄，猜猜怎么着？不过，你知道，我得说，天黑的时候，我就特别想打开我的恐怖故事宝库。我的天哪。我的天哪。还有一个很出名的故事。讲的是一个女孩开车回家，然后有一辆车跟着她，她有点吓坏了。那辆车还时不时地用远光灯晃她。她心想，搞什么鬼？她终于到家了。那辆车一路跟着她。
[00:15:06.570] She's about to get out and be like, yo, what the hell? And then the dude's like, there's like a man in your backseat with like a knife. And I've been high beaming every time he like gets up to kill you. Oh, my God. Dude, that one freaks me out. Yeah, that one makes me always check my backseat at night. Wait, you're so right. I also always check my backseat. Which is probably a good habit to have. Like what if someone did break into your car? There's a lot of car related scary stuff.
[00:15:06.570] 她正要下车，然后说：“卧槽，这是什么情况？” 然后那家伙就说：“你后座有个男人，还拿着刀呢。” 每次他起身要杀你的时候，我都一直开着远光灯。我的天哪。老兄，这事儿真把我吓坏了。是啊，这让我晚上睡觉前都会检查一下后座。等等，你说得对。我也总是检查后座。这或许是个好习惯。万一有人撬开你的车怎么办？跟车有关的恐怖事情太多了。
[00:15:34.190] I think I saw this might have just been like a PSA or something. Not even a scary story. There's something about people hiding under like the bottom of someone's car and like slashing ankles. Wait, I freaking heard about this before. Dude. So then every time I like walk home or something, I'm always like hella fast. Like you can't even see my feet. Wait, I was literally talking with some co-workers and we were like talking about what we're paranoid about.
[00:15:34.190] 我好像看过这个，可能只是个公益广告之类的，根本不是什么恐怖故事。讲的是有人躲在车底之类的，然后割伤别人的脚踝。等等，我之前好像也听说过这事儿。老兄。所以每次我走路回家什么的，我都会跑得飞快，快到你都看不见我的脚。等等，我刚才还在跟几个同事聊天，聊到我们各自担心的事儿呢。
[00:16:01.430] And one of my co-workers brought this one up and I was like, wait. Okay, actually, when they brought it up, it was the first time I heard about it. So since you brought it up this time, I was like, wait, more than one person knows of this. The ankle slasher. Yeah. He's out there. Oh my God. Speaking of checking under stuff. Yeah. There's also another scary story that I've heard. And it's a story about a pair of sisters. And one of the sisters was already home. The other sister came home and was like, hey, what's up? Blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:01.430] 我一个同事提到了这件事，我当时就想，等等。好吧，其实，他们提起这件事的时候，我还是第一次听说。所以这次你又提起了，我就想，等等，不止一个人知道这件事。“割脚踝凶手”。是啊。他就在外面。我的天哪。说到仔细检查东西，嗯。我还听过另一个恐怖故事。是关于一对姐妹的故事。其中一个姐妹已经到家了。另一个姐妹回家后就问，嘿，怎么了？等等等等。
[00:16:31.110] But then the sister that came home suddenly was like, we should go out. Like we should go out to the convenience store. Like let's go grab food. And the other sister who's been home is like, wait, there's literally food already home. Like let's just hang out here. I don't want to get up. Yeah. The other sister was like weirdly super insistent. So she was like, finally like, okay, okay. Like we'll go. And then the sister like dragged her out. Right. The moment they like stepped out of the apartment, she was like, dude, I was trying to like rot. Like, why are you fucking dragging me out?
[00:16:31.110] 但后来回家的那个姐姐突然说，我们应该出去。比如，我们应该去便利店。比如，我们去买点吃的。另一个一直待在家里的姐姐说，等等，家里明明就有吃的。比如，我们就在这儿待着吧。我不想起来。是啊。另一个姐姐莫名其妙地特别坚持。所以她最后说，好吧好吧。比如，我们走吧。然后那个姐姐就把她拖了出去。对。她们一走出公寓，她就说，老兄，我本来只想待在家里。你干嘛把我拖出去？
[00:17:01.210] And then the other sister was like, did you not see the man under the bed? And then they like called the cops and actually like got that man arrested. And I was just like, dude, always put shit. Like I have hella stuff under my bed. So I'm like, we're safe. Like always put shit under your bed. Holy. Holy. Okay. Good thing my bed right now is on like, it doesn't have anything under. You can't put stuff under. That's creepy.
[00:17:01.210] 然后另一个姐妹就说，你们没看到床底下那个人吗？然后她们就报警了，真的把那人抓起来了。我就说，哥们儿，别老往床底下塞东西啊。我床底下也塞了一大堆东西。所以我就说，我们安全了。别老往床底下塞东西啊。我的天。我的天。好吧。还好我现在的床底下什么都没有。你不能往床底下塞东西。那太吓人了。
[00:17:29.990] And also in movies, like people always just hide under the bed. You know, when they're like breaking and then they're like, oh God, there's nowhere to hide. I'll just hide under the bed. I'm always like, where would I hide? It's kind of hard. I feel like it's actually, I wish I was more flexible. Cause hiding requires a lot of like folding physically. And like stretching. Where would you hide though? I don't know. Maybe I would hide in my closet, but behind my cabinet.
[00:17:29.990] 电影里也经常出现这种情况，人们总是躲在床底下。你知道，当他们崩溃的时候，就会想，天哪，没地方躲了。我就躲到床底下吧。我总是想，我到底能躲到哪儿去呢？这有点难。我真希望自己更灵活一些。因为躲藏需要很多身体上的折叠和伸展。那你会躲到哪儿去呢？我不知道。也许我会躲在衣柜里，躲在柜子后面。
[00:17:58.740] There's like a little spot there. Oh, okay. That sounds pretty good. There could be a lot of spiders, but I guess when you're like really scared that shit doesn't matter, huh? I don't know. Maybe it's two times as scary. It's like in those movies when they're hiding and suddenly something like comes out. Yeah. A spider or something. And then it's like, fuck, now I have to stay quiet. And the spider is like dropping down from the ceiling. Holy fuck. I don't know. I kind of feel like there's like a hierarchy though. Okay.
[00:17:58.740] 那儿好像有个小地方。哦，好吧。听起来不错。可能有很多蜘蛛，但我想当你真的害怕的时候，这些都不重要了，对吧？我不知道。也许会吓人两倍。就像电影里那样，他们躲起来，突然有什么东西冒出来。对，一只蜘蛛之类的。然后就想，完了，现在我得保持安静。然后蜘蛛就从天花板上掉下来了。我的天。我不知道。我感觉好像有等级制度似的。好吧。
[00:18:28.500] Infinite death and absence of life is like peak scary. Like that's like a clear winner. And then under it, it's stuff like home invasions, natural disasters, getting murdered and kidnapped, alien abductions. Like that's all in like one lump. And then below that, it's like ghosts. So I actually grew up being really scared of ghosts until I realized how scary all that other stuff was. And now ghosts are like easy mode to me. I see. Yeah.
[00:18:28.500] 永恒的死亡和生命的消逝简直是恐怖的巅峰。这绝对是第一。其次是入室抢劫、自然灾害、谋杀和绑架、外星人绑架之类的。感觉这些都混杂在一起。再往下，就是鬼魂了。我小时候其实很怕鬼，直到我意识到其他那些东西有多可怕。现在鬼魂对我来说简直是小菜一碟。我明白了。是啊。
[00:18:57.840] Home invasion, pretty scary. You mentioned natural disasters. Low key, that's also a big fear of mine. Earthquakes just like freak me out because I'm like, what are we going to do? Yeah. Right? Like we're screwed. I know. And I feel like it feels more real recently. I don't know if it's just confirmation bias or like recency bias or whatever, but I feel like there's been a lot of earthquakes. And if you grew up in California, you know, like every year they're like, the big one is going to happen sometime in our lifetime.
[00:18:57.840] 入室盗窃，真是太可怕了。你提到了自然灾害。说实话，那也是我非常害怕的事情。地震真的让我很恐慌，因为我会想，我们该怎么办？是啊，对吧？感觉我们完蛋了。我知道。而且我觉得最近这种感觉越来越强烈了。我不知道这是不是确认偏差，或者近因效应之类的，但我觉得最近地震真的很多。如果你在加州长大，你就会知道，几乎每年都会有人说，在我们有生之年，总会发生一次大地震。
[00:19:26.920] So I feel like we're just instilled with that like crazy fear of earthquakes. And like, what would happen? The theory is that California someday will earthquake so hard that it like breaks off. Then like what? That means we're going to have to deal with floods too. It'll be two natural disasters in one. Wait, what do you mean break off? Like it'll break off from this chunk of North America. Wait, this is like news to me. Oh shit, my bad.
[00:19:26.920] 我觉得我们好像都被灌输了一种对地震的疯狂恐惧。比如，会发生什么？有一种说法是，加州总有一天会发生强烈地震，震得它像要从北美大陆断裂出来一样。然后呢？那岂不是说我们还要应对洪水？岂不是要同时遭受两种自然灾害？等等，你说的断裂是什么意思？就像它会从北美大陆断裂出来一样？等等，这对我来说简直是新闻。哦，糟糕，我的错。
[00:19:56.140] This was not part of my earthquake lore. Okay, wait, maybe we should fact check me, but I feel like that's like one of the theories or something. California is not on the same tectonic plate as North America, I think. What the hell? So then eventually California would break off. Pretty sure that's the case. Or at least like the West Coast, a portion of the West Coast. Hmm. Sorry to instill a new fear. We'll be like the second Hawaii. Yeah.
[00:19:56.140] 这可不是我了解的地震知识。好吧，等等，或许我们应该核实一下我的说法，但我感觉这好像是某种理论。加州和北美不在同一个板块上，我想。什么鬼？那加州最终会脱离板块吧？我相当肯定是这样。或者至少像西海岸那样，西海岸的一部分会脱离。嗯。抱歉，又让我担心了。我们会变成第二个夏威夷。是啊。
[00:20:27.640] The thing about earthquakes is you kind of don't see it. You don't know it's going to happen until like, what do they say? Like 30 seconds before or something that's like as good as it gets. So it's like a dormant fear. Like if I don't think about it for a while, I'm not that scared of it. However, stuff like tsunamis. Oh my God. I guess it's kind of hand in hand with earthquakes, but tsunamis happen all over the globe. And when I see videos of live action tsunami footage, I get so scared.
[00:20:27.640] 地震这事儿，你根本看不到。你直到……他们说的是什么来着？大概提前30秒左右，差不多就是最短的时间了。所以，这就像一种潜藏的恐惧。如果我一段时间不去想它，我就不会那么害怕。但是，像海啸这种事儿，我的天哪。我觉得它和地震有点类似，但海啸是全球性的。每次看到海啸的现场视频，我都吓得魂飞魄散。
[00:20:57.000] Dude, tsunamis freak me out too. Yeah. Also because in movies, they make tsunamis look like these giant waves about to crash onto the earth. But like in real life, a tsunami is just like this big lump of water coming to you. True. It's like unassuming almost. And that's why sometimes being at the beach like freaks me out a little bit because I'm just like straight up not very educated on how the ocean works. So like the low tide, high tide stuff. Oh yeah.
[00:20:57.000] 老兄，海啸也让我很害怕。是啊。而且电影里总是把海啸描绘成巨浪滔天、即将冲击地球。但现实生活中，海啸就像一大团水向你袭来。没错。它几乎是悄无声息地袭来。所以有时候去海边会让我有点害怕，因为我对海洋的运作机制真的不太了解。比如涨潮、退潮之类的。哦，对。
[00:21:25.200] Like sometimes when you're watching a YouTube video about a tsunami, the comments are like, oh my God, how did no one notice the low tide and like blah, blah. And I'm like, dude, if I were there, I would also not know. And like that scares me. Wait, so you just watch videos of tsunamis in your free time? Okay. It's not a constant thing, but you know, it's one of those rabbit hole days where I'm usually not watching it. And then sometimes I'm watching it for like two hours.
[00:21:25.200] 有时候你在YouTube上看海啸视频，评论里会说，我的天啊，怎么没人注意到低潮之类的。我就想，哥们儿，如果我在那儿，我也会不知道。这让我很害怕。等等，所以你闲暇时间就看海啸视频？好吧。虽然不是一直都这样，但你知道，有时候我会突然沉迷其中，平时我一般不会看，但有时候会一看就是两个小时。
[00:21:54.480] You're like, I need to be prepared. I need to recognize the signs. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the thing. I don't know. The internet makes it so accessible now. On Reddit, there's a subreddit called r slash catastrophic failure or something like that. And it's basically a compilation of any fear anyone has ever had in like bite-sized YouTube videos. And I just, sometimes I spend like hours on that getting really scared.
[00:21:54.480] 你会想，我得做好准备。我得识别出各种迹象。是啊，是啊。问题就在这里。我不知道。现在互联网让这一切变得太容易获取了。在Reddit上，有个叫r/catastrophic failure之类的子版块。它基本上把人们曾经经历过的所有恐惧都剪辑成了短小精悍的YouTube视频。有时候，我会花好几个小时在上面看，真的会吓得魂飞魄散。
[00:22:23.700] So it's not like solutions. It's just like, these are scary videos. Sometimes in the comments, there will be like, I don't know, someone who knows more than I do will explain why this happens, like ways to prevent it, whatever. It's kind of scary that all of this is just at our fingertips. Ignorance is bliss, as they say. Okay. But actually I have a question. Has there been a fear that you've gotten over? Oh my God. Actually.
[00:22:23.700] 所以这不是提供解决方案。这些视频确实挺吓人的。有时候评论里会有人说，我也不知道，但肯定有人比我懂得多，会解释为什么会发生这种情况，或者提供一些预防方法等等。想想这一切就这么触手可及，真是有点可怕。正如人们常说的，无知是福。好吧。其实我有个问题。你有没有克服过什么恐惧？我的天哪。真的。
[00:22:53.460] Yes. I mentioned alien abductions. Right. That fear, I can completely blame on this. You know that one channel, like the sci-fi channel or something? It's like X-Files or something? Oh yeah. Like one of the channels with all the like extraterrestrial stuff. Maybe it was also the history channel where they would have this one show dedicated to alien abductions. I think I used to like watch that from time to time when I was young.
[00:22:53.460] 对，我提到了外星人绑架。没错。那种恐惧，完全可以归咎于此。你知道那个频道吗？好像是科幻频道之类的？像《X档案》那种？哦，对。就是那种专门播外星人相关内容的频道。也可能是历史频道，他们有个节目专门讲外星人绑架。我小时候偶尔会看。
[00:23:22.360] So I grew up with like this really intense fear of alien abductions. And I guess honestly, just a fear of aliens in general. Yeah. As I've grown up, I'm like slowly losing that fear. And honestly, like a lot of it is, you know, when NASA is like, oh, scientists find signs of life on whatever planet 120 light years away, articles like that will come out. And then I'll always click it to this day. Like, oh my God, is there an alien?
[00:23:22.360] 所以，我从小就非常害怕外星人绑架。说实话，其实就是害怕外星人本身。是的。随着年龄增长，这种恐惧感正在慢慢消失。说实话，很多时候，你知道，当NASA发布“科学家在120光年外的某个星球上发现了生命迹象”之类的文章时，我都会忍不住点进去看。直到今天，我还是会忍不住点进去看。心想：我的天哪，真的有外星人吗？
[00:23:51.580] And it's always like traces of water found on this planet point to potential signs of life. And I'm like, okay, we'll probably be safe. Oh yeah. There was actually an article recently that was like scientists find potential like signs of life on some planet. Yeah. Okay. What do you think of the theory related to aliens that instead of us being like the world
[00:23:51.580] 而且，在这个星球上发现的水的痕迹总是指向潜在的生命迹象。我就想，好吧，我们大概安全了。哦，是的。最近确实有一篇文章说，科学家在某个星球上发现了潜在的生命迹象。是的。好的。你觉得关于外星人的理论怎么样？这个理论认为，我们和他们一样，都是地球人。
[00:24:19.740] that would get captured or like overtaken by aliens? What if we are the most advanced aliens in the universe? Dude. Like what if we're the other people's aliens? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. That would be the most convenient thing, I think, for like our earth and our humanity. But just statistically, if the world is like infinitely expanding, I'm like, how is that possible? You know what I mean?
[00:24:19.740] 会被外星人俘虏或者占领吗？如果我们是宇宙中最先进的外星人呢？老兄，如果我们是其他种族的外星人呢？你明白我的意思吗？是啊，是啊。我觉得这对我们的地球和人类来说是最方便的。但从统计学角度来看，如果世界无限膨胀，我就想，这怎么可能？你明白我的意思吗？
[00:24:48.100] Because we're also like new ish. I think everything has been existing for like billions of years. And then humans are kind of like relatively new. I'm just like, there's there's no way. But it just it took that much time for us to like evolve into us. That's true. But I don't know. I don't want to go full conspiracy. Sometimes I'm like low key a full on conspiracy theorist.
[00:24:48.100] 因为我们也算是比较新的物种。我觉得万物都存在了几十亿年，而人类算是相对较新的。我就觉得，这怎么可能呢？但我们进化成现在的样子确实花了那么长时间。没错。但我不知道。我不想完全变成阴谋论者。有时候，我其实有点像个彻头彻尾的阴谋论者。
[00:25:13.700] But I don't know if this is our first time reaching these technological advancements. As in like internet and stuff, maybe that is the first time it's been invented. But mathematical stuff, I feel like we've reached it in the past is my theory. And, you know, once the library of Alexandria or whatever got like destroyed, maybe all of that knowledge got destroyed with it. Yeah. So I don't know. There's just too many unknown factors for me to conclusively be like we're the most advanced thing.
[00:25:13.700] 但我不知道这是否是我们第一次取得这些技术进步。比如互联网之类的，也许那是第一次发明。但数学方面，我觉得我们过去就有所成就。而且，你知道，亚历山大图书馆之类的建筑被毁后，也许所有相关的知识都随之消失了。是啊。所以我也不确定。未知因素太多，我无法断言我们是最先进的。
[00:25:43.700] Out there. Puts on tinfoil. Actually, this is so funny because I was just at a work happy hour recently. We literally spent two hours talking about conspiracy theories. And one of the crowd favorites that came up was that something about the woolly mammoth and how it's getting reconstructed. That might not even be a theory. And then the other top favorite was something about the pyramids.
[00:25:43.700] 真是够了。戴上锡箔纸。说真的，这事儿太逗了，我前不久刚参加了一次公司欢乐时光聚会。我们足足花了两个小时聊阴谋论。其中一个最热门的话题是关于猛犸象的，说它正在被复原。这可能根本算不上什么理论。另一个最热门的话题是关于金字塔的。
[00:26:12.800] Like, you know how we see the top of the pyramid? Uh-huh. There's like all these signs that point to the pyramids being like five times as long and everything's just buried under sand. Whoa. Yeah. We're just huddled in a corner talking about this stuff. Those are some pretty fun conspiracy theories. Right? Hmm. I guess to an extent. Do you think conspiracy theories go hand in hand with big fears?
[00:26:12.800] 你知道我们现在看到的金字塔顶端是什么样子吗？嗯哼。有很多迹象表明金字塔的实际长度可能是现在的五倍，而且所有东西都被埋在沙子下面了。哇哦。是啊。我们现在就挤在角落里讨论这些。这些阴谋论挺有意思的，对吧？嗯。某种程度上来说是这样。你觉得阴谋论和人们的恐惧感之间有必然联系吗？
[00:26:39.000] Is this the way that society tries to cope with the unknown? Oh. Oh. Yeah. Like maybe it's a way to explain things that people don't understand. I know one conspiracy theory that like someone in my team is excited about is that like birds aren't real. They're all just like pieces of technology that are spying on us.
[00:26:39.000] 这就是社会应对未知的方式吗？哦，哦，是的。也许这是一种解释人们无法理解的事物的方式。我知道一个阴谋论，我们团队里有人对此很感兴趣，那就是鸟类根本不存在。它们都只是监视我们的科技产品。
[00:27:03.800] So like maybe having these explanations helps people feel less weird about their fear or like feel less intense about their fear. They're like, oh, there's this funny conspiracy theory. Haha. We can all laugh about it. Actually, that's a good point. I think having a big fear could make you feel so crazy sometimes. I guess the easiest way to put it is like there's always crazier out there. So then sometimes it's like grounding to be like, well, this seems a little bit far-fetched.
[00:27:03.800] 所以，或许这些解释能帮助人们减轻对恐惧的恐惧感，或者降低恐惧的强度。他们会想：“哦，原来有个这么搞笑的阴谋论。哈哈，我们都能笑一笑。” 确实，这说得对。我觉得，如果真的非常害怕，有时候会让人觉得自己快疯了。最简单的解释就是，总有更疯狂的事情发生。所以，有时候我们需要冷静下来，告诉自己：“嗯，这听起来有点牵强。”
[00:27:33.100] So what's the worst it could be? You know? Yeah. But back to like getting over some of your fears, there actually is a fear that I recently have noticed that I'm less affected by. Airplane turbulence. Oh. Because I feel like airplane turbulence can quickly spiral into basically like, oh God, we're going to die. Right? So I used to be really, really afraid of airplane turbulence. But then I learned about it.
[00:27:33.100] 所以最糟糕的情况是什么？你知道吗？嗯。不过话说回来，关于克服一些恐惧，我最近发现自己对一种恐惧的恐惧感减轻了不少。那就是飞机颠簸。哦。因为我觉得飞机颠簸很容易演变成“天哪，我们要死了”的那种感觉。对吧？所以我以前真的非常非常害怕飞机颠簸。但后来我了解了一些相关知识。
[00:28:03.160] And that has actually helped me. So like airplane turbulence, the analogy that you can think of is an airplane is in like a cup of jello. And when turbulence happens, it's shaking. But the airplane doesn't dip. It's just like shaking because the air there is like rough or like whatever. We're just shaking. Dude, I also read that. And that also helped me get over that fear too. And then the other thing that I saw was sometimes the turbulence is like shaking, but other times
[00:28:03.160] 这确实帮了我不少忙。就像飞机遇到气流颠簸一样，你可以想象一下，飞机就像在一杯果冻里。遇到颠簸的时候，飞机就会晃动。但飞机不会下沉，只是因为气流比较颠簸，所以会晃动。哥们，我也看过类似的描述，这也帮我克服了恐惧。我还发现，有时候气流颠簸就像晃动，但有时候……
[00:28:32.360] it can feel like a big drop or something or like a big movement. Right? Right. And I remember that comment was like, yeah, those things are called air pockets. And it's basically the in-air version of hitting a pothole. Oh. And I was like, whoa. So then it does help me not feel as scared now, which is kind of ironic considering all of the like airplane stuff that's been happening lately. Yeah. Now I'm not scared of turbulence. I'm scared of other airplane shit. Yeah. I'm scared of like Boeing aircraft.
[00:28:32.360] 感觉就像一下子掉下去似的，或者像剧烈晃动。对吧？对。我记得当时有人说，是啊，那些东西叫气穴。基本上就是飞机上撞到坑洞的翻版。哦。我当时就想，哇哦。所以现在我的确没那么害怕了，考虑到最近发生的各种飞机事故，这还挺讽刺的。是啊。现在我不怕乱流了。我怕的是其他飞机上的问题。对。我怕的是波音飞机。
[00:29:03.180] But yeah, that's a good one. Isn't it funny that sometimes it just takes one like Reddit comment or something to like help us get over these fears that we've had for 20 plus years. Oh my God. Yeah. I think nothing will get rid of my fear of the dark. We kind of talked about how sometimes having these fears is like almost a protective mechanism.
[00:29:03.180] 是啊，这确实是个好例子。是不是很奇怪，有时候只需要一条Reddit评论之类的，就能帮我们克服困扰了20多年的恐惧。我的天哪。是啊。我觉得没有什么能彻底消除我对黑暗的恐惧。我们之前也聊过，有时候这些恐惧就像是一种自我保护机制。
[00:29:25.740] So do you feel like your fear of the dark is maybe connected to our biology or like your DNA or something? Dude, I don't know. So for the dark one, I'm not super sure because I feel like I'm also a night owl. And if I'm a night owl, then maybe I was like the person who was the night watch or something. Like back in the cave in times. Yeah.
[00:29:25.740] 所以你觉得你对黑暗的恐惧可能跟我们的生物学特性或者DNA之类的有关吗？老兄，我不知道。至于对黑暗的恐惧，我不太确定，因为我觉得自己也是个夜猫子。如果我是个夜猫子，那我可能以前是守夜人什么的。就像远古时期在山洞里那样。嗯。
[00:29:54.920] Like I was like, yeah, you guys go ahead and go to sleep. I got the next couple hours. But then I'm like, then why would I be scared of the dark? Shouldn't I be thriving in the dark? Oh, maybe it's like you're more sensitive to stuff that's in the dark because you used to be night watch. Honestly, maybe. That's a good theory. But I think I do have one fear that I often think is probably linked to like some sort of
[00:29:54.920] 我当时就想，行了，你们先去睡觉吧。我还有几个小时的时间。但后来我又想，那我为什么会怕黑呢？难道我不应该在黑暗中如鱼得水吗？哦，也许是因为你以前当过夜班保安，所以对黑暗中的东西更敏感。说真的，也许吧。这倒是个不错的解释。但我确实有一种恐惧，我经常觉得它可能跟某种……有关。
[00:30:24.640] biological like self protection mechanism. I'm very scared of heights. Like I actually have a physical reaction. You know how you said if you think too much about infinite death, it makes you kind of like shaky. Yeah. When I'm like really high up and I look down, I kind of like lose strength in my hands. I'm like, oh, God, I need to like back away. Oh, how high do you have to be?
[00:30:24.640] 就像生物本能的自我保护机制。我非常恐高。真的会有生理反应。你知道你说过，如果想太多关于死亡的事情，就会有点发抖吗？对。当我在很高的地方往下看的时候，我的手就会感觉使不上劲。我会想，天哪，我得赶紧后退。哦，到底要多高才会恐高呢？
[00:30:51.220] Like, you know, when you go to Japan, you can go up like Tokyo Tower and see like all of Tokyo. Mm hmm. Does that kind of height scare you or does it have to be even higher? Dude, that's like enough. Couple stories. It's pretty good. Yeah. The big trigger is like looking down. If I just look out forward for the most part, it's OK. But the moment I like look down and for some reason I'm always tempted to look down, it like freaks me out. Yeah, I feel that.
[00:30:51.220] 你知道，你去日本的时候，可以去东京塔，把整个东京都尽收眼底。嗯哼。那种高度吓到你了吗？还是得更高才行？哥们儿，也就几层楼高吧。挺不错的。是啊。最让我害怕的是往下看。如果我只是往前看，大部分时间都还好。但只要我往下看，而且不知道为什么我总是忍不住想往下看，就会吓得我魂飞魄散。嗯，我懂。
[00:31:19.240] I think that one does have to be biological because so many people have it. And it's like very self-preservation because like, you know, you'll probably not end up too well. Yeah. At the bottom. Yeah. I watched like a documentary called Free Solo a couple of years ago. Yeah. And it's about some guy who scales like the sides of mountains and he does it without being like hung on to the side of the mountain. So it's like minimal equipment, which means like maximum risk of falling to your death.
[00:31:19.240] 我觉得这肯定跟生物本能有关，因为很多人都有。这就像是一种自我保护机制，因为你知道，你摔下去可能就没那么好运了。是啊，摔到谷底。是啊。几年前我看过一部叫《徒手攀岩》的纪录片。是啊，讲的是一个家伙徒手攀爬山体，而且他没有借助任何绳索之类的东西。所以他用的装备极少，这意味着坠落身亡的风险极大。
[00:31:49.280] Yeah. And the whole time my hands are just sweaty. Dude. I was like, this is an evolutionary response. When people are not scared of heights, I'm like, how is that possible? Yeah. That almost feels like they're just not scared of death. Oh, their ancestors must have been the ones going up really high to like look for where the food and water was. Right? Whoa. I like that theory. They're the scouts. Yeah. Wait, are you scared of heights?
[00:31:49.280] 是啊。而且我全程手心都出汗了。老兄。我就想，这是一种进化反应。有些人居然不恐高，我就纳闷，这怎么可能？是啊。感觉他们好像根本不怕死。哦，他们的祖先肯定爬到很高的地方去寻找食物和水源。对吧？哇。我喜欢这个理论。他们是侦察兵。是啊。等等，你恐高吗？
[00:32:18.660] I am. I think I'm more scared of falling. The heights aspect is a little bit more bearable. But I'm scared of falling and I'm scared of going really fast. Skiing, for example, if I go really high up, I like can't do it. Like I start breathing really fast and getting like a little bit lightheaded. And roller coasters as well. Oh yeah, I'm pretty bad with roller coasters too. I remember you mentioned earlier like, oh, roller coasters is like controlled fear, right? I was like, dude.
[00:32:18.660] 是的。我觉得我更害怕坠落。恐高倒是还能忍受一些。但我害怕坠落，也害怕速度太快。比如滑雪，如果滑得特别高，我就受不了。我会开始呼吸急促，有点头晕。还有过山车。哦对，我也很怕过山车。我记得你之前说过，过山车就像是可控的恐惧，对吧？我当时就想，老兄，你这话可真够呛。
[00:32:48.900] Not for me. I ain't riding a roller coaster. Yeah. For others. But who knows? Was there a time in your life where you were riding roller coasters a lot? Because sometimes I feel like exposure does help even with physical responses like this. Not really, but I can ride roller coasters, but it takes me some time. So like I have to warm up on like a kid roller coaster and then I can ride like a medium level roller coaster.
[00:32:48.900] 对我来说不行。我可不坐过山车。是啊，对其他人来说。但谁知道呢？你以前经常坐过山车吗？因为有时候我觉得多接触过山车确实有帮助，即使是像这种生理反应。其实没有，但我能坐过山车，只是需要一些时间。我得先坐儿童过山车热身，然后才能坐中级过山车。
[00:33:17.560] And then I can ride like something a little bigger. Yeah. So, you know, if we were at the theme park for a day, like it'll take me half a day to get up to. If you want to ride a big roller coaster with me, I need a warm up. It's like a whole curriculum. Yeah. I think I'm similar for the most part. If I don't have to ride it, I won't ride it. And that's like my preferred. Yeah.
[00:33:17.560] 然后我就可以去玩一些更刺激的了。是啊。所以，你知道，如果我们在主题公园玩一天，我得花半天时间才能热身。如果你想和我一起坐大型过山车，我需要先热身。这就像一整套课程。是啊。我觉得我大部分时候都差不多。如果不是非坐不可，我就不会坐。这才是我的偏好。是啊。
[00:33:43.860] I think especially in high school, if everyone's doing it, you can't be the only one sitting out. So then I would on those brave days being surrounded by people that were pressuring me, I would be on like drop zone and shit. Oh my God. I don't know how I did it. That's called peer pressure. And that's the scariest thing of all. Okay. I do have a funny story, though.
[00:33:43.860] 我觉得尤其是在高中，如果大家都这么做，你就不能是唯一一个袖手旁观的人。所以，在那些充满勇气的日子里，周围都是给我施加压力的人，我就像在跳伞一样，紧张得要命。我的天哪。我不知道我是怎么做到的。这就是所谓的同辈压力。而这才是最可怕的事情。好吧。不过，我确实有个有趣的故事。
[00:34:09.940] I don't remember if I ever shared on the podcast, but one time it was like a theme park day at school because maybe it was like a graduation year or something. And then one of my friends was like, oh, my God, I really want to ride this roller coaster. And I was like, dude, I'm too scared. I don't I don't want to ride it. And she's like, please, it'll be so fun. And I was peer pressured to riding it with her because eventually I was like, damn, I don't want her to like miss out on this just because I was like, no, I'm too scared.
[00:34:09.940] 我不记得有没有在播客里说过，但有一次学校搞主题公园活动，可能是因为那年是毕业季之类的。然后我一个朋友突然说：“天哪，我好想坐过山车！” 我当时就说：“老兄，我太害怕了，我不想坐。” 她就说：“拜托，肯定很好玩。” 最后我还是被她“怂恿”着陪她一起坐了，因为我想，哎，我不能让她因为我害怕就错过这么好玩的体验。
[00:34:38.940] So then we wrote it and I was scared shitless. And then when we got off, she was like, damn, you really were scared. My bad. Like, I thought we were just playing. Wait, do you like scream or do you just wither away? Why wither away? I like become small and I'm like gripping with like for dear life. And I'm like, oh, God.
[00:34:38.940] 所以我们就写了那段，我吓得魂飞魄散。然后我们结束的时候，她说，天哪，你真的吓坏了。我的错。我还以为我们只是在玩呢。等等，你是会尖叫还是会慢慢消失？为什么要消失？我会变得很小，然后拼命抓住什么东西，就像在生死边缘挣扎。然后我就想，哦，天哪。
[00:35:05.340] I hate the feeling on a roller coaster where you feel like you're choking on air. Oh, yeah. So sometimes I literally have to like curl up in a defensive ball. Yeah. Yeah. I'll close my eyes. Oh, same. Because that helps a little. Mm hmm. Roller coasters be scary. Honestly, roller coaster, big fear. Wait, you know what's also like a, okay, that's like a medium fear, but I'm really scared of like haunted houses and like haunted mazes.
[00:35:05.340] 我讨厌坐过山车时那种感觉，好像要被空气呛到一样。哦，对。所以有时候我真的得蜷成一团，像个防御球一样。对，对。我会闭上眼睛。哦，我也是。因为那样有点用。嗯哼。过山车真可怕。说真的，过山车，我超级害怕。等等，你知道还有什么也挺吓人的吗？好吧，那算是中等程度的恐惧吧，我真的很怕鬼屋和鬼屋迷宫。
[00:35:33.060] Maybe a maze is like a better way to describe it. But you know how on Halloween you can like pay $10 and like go through the thing and there's like actors trying to scare you. Yeah. Like that shit is so scary to me for some reason, even though I know it's all fake. Dude, it's because they jump scare and it always gets you. True. But I like jump scares in movies, so I don't know why. Like maybe just in person, I'm like super scared. Because this time the jump scare is happening to you, not another person.
[00:35:33.060] 或许用迷宫来形容更贴切。你知道万圣节的时候，你可以花10美元进去体验一下，里面有演员吓唬你。对，不知道为什么，那种东西对我来说特别吓人，即使我知道都是假的。哥们，是因为他们会突然吓你一跳，而且总是能把你吓到。没错。但我喜欢电影里的突然惊吓，所以我也不知道为什么。可能只是在现实生活中，我会特别害怕。因为这次突然吓到你的是你自己，而不是别人。
[00:36:00.420] I'm like a keyboard warrior version of horror stuff. I want to be removed. Yeah. You're like, I can only watch this jump scare in third person. It cannot be happening IRL. Yeah, that stuff is scary, man. Okay, like think about it this way. What if it was a haunted house, but there's actually an option to ride this like carriage that's a little off the ground and you're watching people go through the haunted house and experience jump scares.
[00:36:00.420] 我简直就是恐怖片里的键盘侠。我只想被屏蔽。是啊。你会想，我只能用第三人称视角看这种惊吓镜头。现实生活中绝对不可能发生这种事。是啊，那玩意儿真吓人。好吧，你想想，如果这是一座鬼屋，但你可以选择乘坐一种离地有点高的马车，看着人们在鬼屋里穿梭，体验各种惊吓镜头呢？
[00:36:30.120] Like that would be good for you, right? Yeah. Or even if it was like a ride. Maybe it's like the, maybe I'm scared of walking. Wait, what? Is walking a big fear? Yeah. I was like, I feel like if I was sitting, it would be okay. Walking, big fear. Maybe because if you're like standing or walking and you jump scare, you sometimes like crumble, you know? True. I think I sometimes crumble at jump scares.
[00:36:30.120] 那对你来说应该挺好的，对吧？嗯。或者哪怕是坐个游乐设施也行。也许是，也许我害怕走路。等等，什么？走路是你最大的恐惧？是啊。我当时想，如果坐着的话，我觉得就没事了。走路，我最大的恐惧。也许是因为如果你站着或者走路的时候突然被吓到，有时候会吓得瘫倒，你知道吗？没错。我觉得我有时候会被突然吓到的吓到瘫倒。
[00:36:59.260] Wait, we're just always withering away. Yeah, I don't scream. I just wither away in any situation. You know, they say that you have a fight or flight reaction. I would think screaming is like fight, right? Oh, like it scares them back kind of. Yeah. Yeah. But maybe we are like flight. Wait, but if we're crumbling, if our legs are locking under us, it's like neither.
[00:36:59.260] 等等，我们只是在慢慢消亡。是啊，我不会尖叫。我只会在任何情况下慢慢消亡。你知道，人们常说人有战斗或逃跑的反应。我觉得尖叫就像战斗，对吧？哦，就像能把他们吓跑一样。是啊。是啊。但也许我们更像是逃跑。等等，但如果我们崩溃了，如果我们双腿发软，那就既不是战斗也不是逃跑了。
[00:37:29.220] It's just like accept our fate. We're like dying. We're over it. I think the like amendment to it was like fight, flight or freeze. Oh, fuck. We're definitely freeze, I think. Oh, God. If like a car came at you, do you think you would have the ability to run away? Or would you kind of freeze in shock?
[00:37:29.220] 就像接受命运一样。我们就像在等死。我们已经受够了。我觉得对它的修正应该是：战斗、逃跑或僵住。哦，该死。我们肯定会僵住，我想。哦，天哪。如果有一辆车朝你冲过来，你觉得你能跑得掉吗？还是会吓得动弹不得？
[00:37:58.120] Damn, I'd like to think I would run away. But I feel like I would legit be like deer in headlights. Well, I don't know. Do you think you would run out of the way? Or would you just stand there? I would try to, but I might also be. Like it takes a second to like register what's happening. But I think the odd part is like if I were in a car driving, I think I would be able to react. Because maybe it's like a smaller movement that you have to make. Oh, because you just have to tip your toe.
[00:37:58.120] 哎，我真希望自己能跑掉。但感觉我可能真的会像被车灯照到的鹿一样不知所措。嗯，我也不知道。你觉得你会跑开吗？还是会傻站在那里？我会试着跑，但也可能就那样。感觉需要一秒钟才能反应过来发生了什么。但我觉得奇怪的是，如果我在开车，我觉得我应该能做出反应。因为也许只需要做一些很小的动作。哦，因为你只需要踮起脚尖就行了。
[00:38:28.240] Yeah, like you either tip your toe or like move the steering wheel a bit. But if it's like, you know, full body like sprinting, that might take a second. So basically, we just need to be seated. Don't trust us when we're on our feet. This is like, you know, those survival movies. Someone in a precarious situation and will they be able to make it out alive?
[00:38:28.240] 对，就像你踮起脚尖或者稍微转动一下方向盘。但如果是那种全身冲刺，那可能要花点时间。所以基本上，我们只需要坐着。别相信我们站着的样子。这就像那些生存电影一样，有人身处险境，他们能活着脱险吗？
[00:38:56.720] Like, yeah, I always watch those movies. Well, more specific. I always watch clipped version of those movies on like TikTok as like a movie recap or something. Yeah. And I'm always just like, I don't think I could do what this person is doing. I don't think I would have the grit and like the critical thinking abilities. And honestly, just like the will to live to get out of situations like that. Wait, not having the will to live is crazy. I think you would.
[00:38:56.720] 对啊，我总是看那些电影。更准确地说，我总是在TikTok上看那些电影的剪辑版，就像电影回顾之类的。对。我总是会想，我觉得我做不到这个人做的事。我觉得我没有那种毅力，也没有那种批判性思维能力。说实话，我甚至没有那种从那种困境中脱身的求生欲望。等等，没有求生欲望？这太离谱了。我觉得你应该有。
[00:39:22.120] I think you would come through because if you think about it, your biggest all time fear is infinite death. True. You're so right. So at some point, you'll be able to find the motivation. It might take five minutes longer, but you'll get there. I'll need to have like multiple cries before I could bring myself to do it. There's a movie recap that I never skip on TikTok every time I get it. Like I'll sit and watch the whole thing again.
[00:39:22.120] 我觉得你肯定能做到，因为仔细想想，你最大的恐惧不就是永无止境的死亡吗？没错，你说得太对了。所以总有一天你会找到动力的。也许需要多花五分钟，但你最终会成功的。我得哭好几次才能鼓起勇气去做。TikTok上有个电影回顾视频，我每次看到都会看，每次都会坐下来再完整地看一遍。
[00:39:49.840] Two girls that get stuck on top of like, you know, those really tall telephone poles. Have you seen this one? Yeah. I've seen the TikTok recaps. It's so gripping. And basically the gist for anyone who hasn't seen it is like, these girls are like really good climbers. They climb the top of this really tall telephone pole and they get like stuck there because the ladder breaks. And it's like, how will you handle like getting back down to ground floor with like zero cell phone service?
[00:39:49.840] 两个女孩被困在那种很高的电线杆顶上。你看过这个视频吗？看过。我看过TikTok上的回顾视频。太刺激了。简单来说，就是这两个女孩都是攀爬高手。她们爬到一根很高的电线杆顶上，结果梯子断了，被困在那儿了。问题是，在手机完全没信号的情况下，她们要怎么才能回到地面呢？
[00:40:19.280] And like half your shit is not with you anymore. Like stuff like that. Yeah. And I'm always just like amazed. I don't know if I could. Okay. In that situation, you would have to get over your fear of heights to even be able to start thinking about survival. Right? Yeah. There's like a couple things. Once you're that deep into it, I assume it starts to become a game of statistics.
[00:40:19.280] 感觉你一半的东西都不在身边了。诸如此类。是啊。我总是觉得很不可思议。我不知道我能不能做到。好吧。在这种情况下，你得先克服恐高症才能开始考虑如何生存。对吧？是啊。有好几件事。一旦你深陷其中，我想这就会变成一场概率游戏。
[00:40:43.980] Oh, I could die trying doing this, but at least I'd have like a 10% chance of avoiding infinite death. Right? Yeah. And so you're like, okay, fuck it. Like we just got to do it. And then I think there's another statistic that starts to maybe like be a factor, which is like, okay, I could just sit up here and wither away. And that's like a slow and painful death. Or, you know, if I fucked up like trying to get down, I'll just fall to my death. I'll be quick and painless.
[00:40:43.980] 哦，我这么做可能会死，但至少有10%的几率能避免永世不得超生。对吧？没错。所以你就会想，好吧，管他呢。我们必须这么做。然后我觉得还有另一个因素开始起作用，那就是，好吧，我可能就这么坐在这里慢慢枯萎死去。那是一种缓慢而痛苦的死亡。或者，你知道，如果我在尝试下去的时候搞砸了，我会直接摔死。我会死得很快，而且不会痛苦。
[00:41:14.980] Damn, that is true. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about the situation, actually. Oh my God. Yeah. That thing is crazy. And then I looked it up on Wikipedia and I read the plot. Wait, I'm sorry. Can we talk about the thing that you texted me about the last few weeks? Wait, what was it? Basically, you texted me that you had watched this scary movie. Oh. And I was like, oh my God, because I thought you had actually watched it.
[00:41:14.980] 天哪，确实如此。说真的，我光是想想那件事就手心冒汗了。我的天啊。是啊。那东西太疯狂了。然后我在维基百科上查了一下，看了剧情简介。等等，不好意思。我们能聊聊你这几周发短信跟我说的那件事吗？等等，是什么来着？基本上，你发短信告诉我你看了一部恐怖电影。哦。我当时就想，我的天啊，因为我以为你真的看过了。
[00:41:42.360] And it turns out you are watching it on someone else's airplane screen. And then like you read the Wikipedia page for it after. Is that right? Yeah. So the person next to me was watching Smile 2. They had subs on too. So I was like, oh, nice. Like for some reason, I just couldn't stop. Like I couldn't take my eyes away. And then after the flight, I texted you. I was like, oh my God, I watched Smile 2. It was like a good movie. And you were like, wow.
[00:41:42.360] 结果发现你是在别人的飞机屏幕上看的。然后你还看了维基百科上的相关页面，是吗？对。我旁边的人在看《微笑2》，他们还开了字幕。我就想，哦，不错。不知道为什么，我就是停不下来，眼睛根本移不开。然后下飞机后，我给你发了短信，说，天哪，我看了《微笑2》，电影真好看。你回复说，哇。
[00:42:12.280] And then you were like, you need to watch Smile 1. Yeah. And I was like, oh, hopefully someone watches it on the flight home. I was like, I guess Crystal watching it by herself is not an option. Maybe this is how we get over our big fears. You watch other people watch stuff. You watch other people go through stuff. You do everything by proxy. And that's how you level up. Right. Because you learn from other people.
[00:42:12.280] 然后你就说，你得看看《微笑1》。对。我就想，哦，希望有人能在回家的航班上看。我想，克丽丝塔尔一个人看肯定不行。也许这就是我们克服恐惧的方式。你看别人看什么，你看别人经历什么，你通过别人的视角来体验一切。这就是你提升自己的方式。对吧。因为你可以从别人身上学习。
[00:42:42.700] Well, this has been fun to sit down and talk through our big fears. Because I think we talk about our small and medium fears a lot. But we never really talk about our big fears. So thank you, Crystal. It's always fun to sit and chat with you about things that scare us in our daily life.
