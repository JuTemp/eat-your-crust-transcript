[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal and I'm Sarah. Welcome back, Sarah. The last time you were on was a while ago, episode 127, Gifts for Loved Ones. Always a good one to listen to during like Christmas and gift giving season, I feel like.
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal，我是Sarah。欢迎回来，Sarah。你上次来还是很久以前，第127期节目，主题是“送给亲人的礼物”。我觉得在圣诞节和送礼季听这个节目总是很不错的。
[00:00:30.190] Today we brought Sarah on because we thought it would be fun to talk about having a sister, because Jeesoo and I both do not have sisters. So we have many questions and many theories maybe?
[00:00:30.190] 今天我们请来了Sarah，因为我们觉得聊聊有姐妹的话题会很有趣，因为我和Jeesoo都没有姐妹。所以我们有很多问题，也可能有很多想法吧？
[00:00:44.110] I feel like at least my personal understanding of sisterhood is just pretty much what media portrays, which I feel like is very one-dimensional or maybe like one-sided versus like the many complexities I'm sure there is behind having a sister as a sibling. Yeah, well thanks for
[00:00:44.110] 我觉得至少就我个人而言，我对姐妹情谊的理解基本上就是媒体所描绘的那样，我觉得这种描绘非常片面，或者说很片面，完全忽略了姐妹关系背后肯定存在的诸多复杂性。嗯，谢谢。
[00:01:02.750] having me back on. Yeah, I'm so excited to kind of pick your brain today, Sarah, because as someone who grew up with no siblings, I have this like fantasy about, you know, childhood with siblings and what siblinghood looks like even in your adulthood as well.
[00:01:02.750] 又能请到我了。是啊，莎拉，我今天特别兴奋能跟你聊聊，因为我从小就没有兄弟姐妹，所以我一直很幻想有兄弟姐妹的童年生活，以及即使成年后，兄弟姐妹之间的关系会是什么样子。
[00:01:16.830] Like Crystal said, I feel like so much of what I think of of sisterhood is from like media or maybe people around me when I was growing up. And I always felt like there was something very
[00:01:16.830] 就像克丽丝塔尔说的那样，我觉得我对姐妹情谊的很多理解都来自媒体，或者可能是我成长过程中身边的人。我一直觉得其中还有一些非常……
[00:01:26.830] complex about sisterhood. I feel like there might be a little bit of a competitive aspect to it because you're the same gender, growing up under the same parents, but maybe you each had like a
[00:01:26.830] 姐妹情谊很复杂。我觉得其中可能存在一些竞争因素，因为你们性别相同，在同一对父母的抚养下长大，但也许你们各自都有过……
[00:01:38.430] different set of rules and regulations depending on the age gap and you have shared interests, but maybe also want to differentiate yourself from your sister. So do you think these kinds of
[00:01:38.430] 根据年龄差距，以及你们可能拥有共同的兴趣爱好，制定不同的规则和规定，但或许你也想和妹妹有所区别。所以你认为这些……
[00:01:48.590] theories are accurate to your experience growing up with a sister or would you say it was really different from what I just noted? No, I think you guys are spot on. I feel like the sisterhood also
[00:01:48.590] 这些理论与你和姐妹一起长大的经历相符吗？还是说你觉得和我刚才说的完全不一样？不，我觉得你们说得完全正确。我觉得姐妹情谊也
[00:01:58.350] just comes in waves. There's ebbs and flows of good times and bad times. I have an older sister named Connie, we're three and a half years apart. And she currently lives in California still with
[00:01:58.350] 就像潮水一样，时而涌来，时而退去。我有个姐姐叫康妮，我们相差三岁半。她现在还住在加州。
[00:02:09.310] my parents and I live in New York. Being in this transitional adult phase has definitely made me appreciate our sisterhood more. In our childhood, it was a lot different. And that's when we did have
[00:02:09.310] 我和父母住在纽约。正处于人生的过渡阶段，这让我更加珍惜我们姐妹之间的情谊。小时候，情况截然不同。那时候，我们确实……
[00:02:21.710] a really strong bond together, but also we had a lot of fights. And I feel like that's just growing up in the same house, living under the same roof. We actually also shared a room up until she went
[00:02:21.710] 我们之间有着非常牢固的感情，但我们也经常吵架。我觉得这都是因为我们从小在同一个屋檐下长大。事实上，在她离开之前，我们一直共用一个房间。
[00:02:32.110] to college. So you can only imagine how close we were. We were just in each other's personal space all the time. But having that time with her in my childhood has also made me appreciate a lot of
[00:02:32.110] 我们都上了大学。所以你可以想象我们当时有多亲密。我们总是形影不离。但童年时和她在一起的时光也让我更加珍惜很多……
[00:02:45.550] older sister complexes that she did have. And it's not something that I was able to appreciate now until reflecting back on it. She was always that older sister figure that was protective. She always had my best interests at heart, even though it didn't always come off that way.
[00:02:45.550] 她确实有姐姐情结。直到现在回想起来，我才真正理解这一点。她一直像个保护我的姐姐，总是为我好，即使有时她的方式可能并不那么直接。
[00:03:03.710] I think that I was just too young and naive to understand at the time that she was always going to be an older sister figure to me. And I kind of just took that for granted a lot.
[00:03:03.710] 我想我当时太年轻太天真了，没意识到她一直都会像姐姐一样照顾我。我常常把这一切视为理所当然。
[00:03:15.150] You brought up a good point. When we're younger, we don't really know what's going on in our siblings or just even our friends' minds. You said there were moments where maybe your sister was
[00:03:15.150] 你提出的观点很好。我们小时候，并不真正了解兄弟姐妹甚至朋友的想法。你说有时候，你觉得你姐姐可能……
[00:03:27.710] being protective or playing the big sister role, but you didn't quite realize at the time and you weren't as grateful for it. Do you have any specific examples maybe? Yeah, I think that even with homework and schoolwork, Connie would always stay up late at midnight and she would
[00:03:27.710] 你当时可能在保护她或者扮演姐姐的角色，但你并没有完全意识到这一点，也没有对此心存感激。你有什么具体的例子吗？嗯，我想即使有家庭作业和学校作业，康妮也总是熬夜到午夜，而且她会……
[00:03:47.230] help me essentially do my projects for me while she let me go to sleep at 10. So I specifically remember book reports. I wouldn't read the book. She would read it for me. And then she would help
[00:03:47.230] 她基本上帮我完成了所有项目，然后让我晚上十点就去睡觉。所以我特别记得读书报告。我不会自己看书，她会帮我读。然后她会帮我……
[00:03:59.070] me with writing and all the content for my book report. I remember school projects of dioramas, she would help me with that. She's always been a part of my learning, I feel like in a lot of ways.
[00:03:59.070] 她帮我写作，还帮我准备读书报告的所有素材。我还记得以前学校做立体模型的时候，她也帮过我。我觉得她在很多方面都参与了我的学习。
[00:04:12.510] She reviewed all my college essays when I was applying to colleges since she was already in college at the time. So those are just some of the many examples that Connie has supported me.
[00:04:12.510] 在我申请大学的时候，她帮我修改了所有的大学申请文书，因为她当时已经在读大学了。以上只是康妮帮助我的众多例子中的几个。
[00:04:24.590] But again, I didn't really realize how much she did sacrifice of her own time and time away from friends, whether she could be doing something else after work or after school. That's so cute.
[00:04:24.590] 但是，我之前真的没有意识到她牺牲了多少自己的时间，也牺牲了和朋友相处的时间，不管她下班后或放学后本来可以做些别的事情。这太令人感动了。
[00:04:37.950] I feel like as an only child, okay, I need to know if other only children out there can relate to this, but I feel like as an only child, I have a PhD in siblingology. And I feel like if you're past
[00:04:37.950] 我觉得作为独生子女，好吧，我想知道其他独生子女是否也有同感，但我觉得作为独生子女，我简直是手足学博士。而且我觉得如果你过去……
[00:04:48.670] six to seven years of an age gap, you're kind of like a mini mom or like a mini parent. And then if you're like one to two years, you're basically like a twin almost. But then three and a
[00:04:48.670] 如果年龄相差六到七岁，你就像个小妈妈或者小家长。如果相差一到两岁，你们基本上就像双胞胎。但如果相差三岁多一点……
[00:04:58.910] half years, I feel like it's like right in between those two stages, where maybe she was playing a little bit of both. So do you feel like the way you saw your sister, whether it was like kind of
[00:04:58.910] 半年时间，我觉得她正处于这两个阶段之间，可能两种阶段都有一些共同之处。所以你觉得你对你妹妹的看法，是像某种……
[00:05:09.150] like a mini mom or maybe more like a sibling slash twin changed a lot throughout your childhood? Or do you think she was mostly one role or the other? I don't necessarily feel like she was a mini mom
[00:05:09.150] 她像个小妈妈，还是更像个兄弟姐妹/双胞胎？她在你的童年时期变化很大吗？或者你觉得她主要扮演的是其中一种角色？我并不觉得她是个小妈妈。
[00:05:20.430] because we had a stay at home mom and she was a full time stay at home mom. So I always had my maternal figure around. So I really do see Connie as just like my older sister, but she went through
[00:05:20.430] 因为我们家是全职家庭主妇，所以我身边一直有母亲般的人物。因此，我真的把康妮当成我的姐姐一样看待，但她经历了很多。
[00:05:32.030] a lot of learnings with my parents too, as like the first siblings always do. So she kind of paved a path for me. And I always feel like the younger sibling probably has it easier in a lot of ways,
[00:05:32.030] 我也从父母那里学到了很多东西，就像所有老大老二一样。所以她某种程度上为我铺平了道路。而且我总觉得，在很多方面，弟弟妹妹可能更容易一些。
[00:05:45.230] right? Your parents go through so many trials of like how they want to parent and she was kind of the guinea pig. I feel like maybe at times there was an underlying tone of a sense of like resentment
[00:05:45.230] 对吧？你父母在育儿方式上经历了很多尝试，而她就像是小白鼠。我觉得有时候，你可能感觉到一丝怨恨的意味。
[00:05:57.390] for how easy that I did get it in comparison to her experiences. I remember, for example, my mom, when Connie got a B in a class, you know, she would cry. And she was like, Oh my god, like you
[00:05:57.390] 想想我经历的那些事，跟她比起来简直太容易了。我记得，比如，我妈康妮要是考了个B，她就会哭。她会说：“我的天哪，跟你一样！”
[00:06:10.110] can do better. But then when I got a B, she's like, Oh my god, good job, Sarah. So I think like the expectations were different. And just like knowing that having a child that has already met
[00:06:10.110] 可以做得更好。但当我考了B之后，她却说：“我的天哪，莎拉，干得好！” 所以我觉得大家的期望值不一样了。而且，知道孩子已经达到某个标准，这种感觉真的很难受。
[00:06:20.910] those expectations, the second one could fall short in some ways or like they were just able to be more relaxed as parents knowing that at the end of the day, they still have a child that is more accomplished
[00:06:20.910] 这些期望，第二个孩子在某些方面可能达不到预期，或者他们作为父母能够更加放松，因为他们知道最终他们的孩子仍然会更加成功。
[00:06:32.910] in some ways. Yeah, I feel like as a fellow younger sibling, I've definitely felt that where it's like Oh, did my parents just like stop caring by the time I got there? Like they just kind of gave up
[00:06:32.910] 在某些方面是这样。是的，作为弟弟妹妹，我肯定有过这种感觉，感觉就像，哦，是不是等我长大后，父母就不再关心我了？感觉他们好像放弃了我。
[00:06:43.230] they're like, Oh, fuck it. Like this is the best we're gonna get anyway. Yeah, I would definitely say that when it came to me with school and grades, my parents were more relaxed than they were with
[00:06:43.230] 他们就像是，哦，算了。反正这就是我们能得到的最好结果了。是的，我肯定会说，就我的学业和成绩而言，我的父母比他们对待我的方式要放松得多。
[00:06:53.950] Connie. I do want to touch on what you mentioned earlier, though, like, did you ever feel competitive with your sister? I feel like being the same gender maybe awakens that a little more. Like
[00:06:53.950] 康妮，我想谈谈你之前提到的那个话题，比如，你有没有和你的妹妹有过竞争的感觉？我觉得同性之间可能会更容易产生这种感觉。
[00:07:06.350] whatever you can do, like I can do too. Because it's almost like a direct reflection of yourself, but like older, or like a version of what you could be that you're seeing in front of you. So
[00:07:06.350] 你能做的，我也能做。因为它几乎就像是你自身的直接反映，只不过更成熟一些，或者说是你未来可能成为的样子，而你现在就站在它面前。
[00:07:17.870] do you think there's competition there? I think that I alluded to this earlier that Connie was just always academically better than I was. However, I do think that where I did shine a
[00:07:17.870] 你觉得我们之间有竞争吗？我之前好像也提到过，康妮的学业成绩一直比我好。不过，我觉得我也有擅长的领域……
[00:07:27.790] little bit more was more my creative and artistic side and also sports. So I never really felt that there was anything to compare when it came to school. She already took that one as the winner,
[00:07:27.790] 我更喜欢发挥自己的创造力和艺术天赋，还有运动。所以我觉得在学校里，这两方面都没什么可比的。她已经把那份成就当成了最终的赢家。
[00:07:40.510] but where I could make up for in what I was better at was in art and also just extracurriculars and things like that. Oh, so it was more like she's claimed like these categories to excel in. So
[00:07:40.510] 但我擅长的领域，比如艺术，还有课外活动等等，可以弥补我的不足。哦，所以更像是她声称自己在这些方面很擅长。
[00:07:56.190] maybe I should just focus on other areas that I can personally excel in. So you're not as caught up in almost like living in her shadow, I guess, in some aspects. Yeah, that's pretty smart. It's
[00:07:56.190] 或许我应该专注于其他我能擅长的领域。这样，你就不会像以前那样，在某些方面活在她的阴影下了。是啊，这很明智。
[00:08:08.750] very wise for like being so young. You're like, okay, fuck it. I'm not even gonna compete with you for this. I'm just gonna focus on other things. Exactly. Just doing my own thing. Yeah,
[00:08:08.750] 年纪轻轻就这么成熟。你会想，好吧，算了。我根本不想跟你竞争。我只想专注于其他事情。没错。就做我自己的事。是啊。
[00:08:19.870] I do feel like our parents praised us for all of the things that we were great at. So it was just nice that we each had our own thing and was recognized as such in our household. And my
[00:08:19.870] 我觉得父母会表扬我们所有擅长的事情。所以，我们每个人都有自己的特长，并且在家里都能得到认可，这感觉真的很好。而且我的
[00:08:30.590] parents didn't really place any more emphasis on me trying to do better in school or Connie better at like dance and art. So it was just really nice to not feel like I did have a competition. And
[00:08:30.590] 父母并没有特别强调我该在学校里表现得更好，或者康妮该在舞蹈和艺术方面表现得更好。所以，感觉自己没有竞争压力，这真的很好。
[00:08:43.310] like you said, crystal living in the shadow of my sister. So I have a question about I guess, the relationship that you had with your sister because it doesn't seem like there was a ton of
[00:08:43.310] 就像你说的，克丽丝塔尔一直生活在姐姐的阴影下。所以我想问问你和你姐姐的关系，因为感觉你们之间好像没什么交集。
[00:08:53.230] maybe direct competition like within the spheres that you guys dove into. But I feel like within the family, siblings are sometimes allies against the parents slash against the outside world. And sometimes there's almost like an enemy aspect of like, Oh, mom, like she did this, like she did
[00:08:53.230] 或许像你们涉足的那些领域一样，存在直接竞争。但我感觉在家庭内部，兄弟姐妹有时会结盟对抗父母，对抗外部世界。有时又会有一种敌对情绪，比如，“哦，妈妈，她做了这个，她做了那个”
[00:09:13.470] that. So what do you think kind of came up more for you and your sister? Were you more allies or enemies? I think we were more allies in our childhood. But once Connie went to college,
[00:09:13.470] 就是这样。那么你觉得你和你妹妹之间，哪种情况比较常见？你们是更像盟友还是敌人？我觉得我们小时候更像盟友。但康妮上了大学之后，
[00:09:24.430] and we didn't live together anymore. And I was in high school that I feel like we grew into our personalities a little bit more had more opinions. And that's when we started to have a
[00:09:24.430] 我们不再住在一起了。我上高中的时候，感觉我们俩的性格都更加成熟了，也更有主见了。也就是从那时起，我们开始……
[00:09:34.270] little bit more conflict. And then now coming back to adulthood and entering our late 20s, early 30s is when we kind of see the world in a very similar way where we're both working adults.
[00:09:34.270] 冲突稍微多了些。然后现在，当我们重返成年，进入20多岁末、30岁初的时候，我们看待世界的方式变得非常相似，因为我们都是工作繁忙的成年人。
[00:09:48.590] And we just have the mutual respect for each other. So I feel like it came in waves for us being together or fighting. I have a funny story to share as to why Connie and I stopped talking
[00:09:48.590] 我们彼此都很尊重对方。所以我觉得我们之间的关系就像潮水一样，时而亲密，时而争吵。我有个关于我和康妮不再说话的趣事想跟你分享。
[00:10:02.030] for a year or so while she was in college. So I mentioned this earlier that we shared a room with each other up until she left for college. At the time when we were in high school,
[00:10:02.030] 在她上大学的那一年左右，我们一直住在一起。我之前提到过，在她上大学之前，我们一直合住一个房间。那时我们还在上高中，
[00:10:13.150] I vividly remember a lot of people selling like their things on Facebook, right? Like whether it be clothes or like use technology and like gadgets and whatever. Connie's clothes were taking up
[00:10:13.150] 我清楚地记得当时很多人在Facebook上卖东西，对吧？不管是衣服，还是科技产品、小玩意儿之类的。康妮的衣服占了很大一部分。
[00:10:24.750] closet space in our room. And I, in my head, I thought that anything that she didn't take to college meant that she didn't really care for right? So I ended up selling some of her clothes.
[00:10:24.750] 我们房间的衣柜空间有限。我当时想，她没带去大学的东西，肯定说明她并不真正喜欢，对吧？所以我最后把她的一些衣服卖掉了。
[00:10:36.350] And obviously she saw on Facebook and she bitched me out and unfriend me on Facebook for a whole year. And looking back at it, it's hilarious. We talk about it all the time. Now she tells
[00:10:36.350] 很明显，她在脸书上看到了，狠狠地骂了我一顿，还把我从脸书好友列表里删除了一整年。现在回想起来，真是太搞笑了。我们经常聊起这件事。现在她跟我说……
[00:10:48.190] her friends all about it. But I think it's just those types of things that sisters fight about and just having a sister to like, fight about clothes and stupid stuff like that is just kind
[00:10:48.190] 她的朋友们都很喜欢这件事。但我认为姐妹之间吵架就是为了这类事情，有个姐妹可以一起为了衣服之类的琐事吵架，感觉真的很好。
[00:11:00.670] of the only fights that we would have. Connie would send me this meme. I don't know if you guys seen this before, but it's like a screenshot of like sisters texting. It's just like, why did you
[00:11:00.670] 我们之间几乎没怎么吵过架。康妮会给我发这个表情包。不知道你们有没有看过，就是姐妹俩发短信的截图。内容大概是：你为什么要这么做？
[00:11:09.870] borrow my clothes without asking? And then just like ranting at each other and the next text is like, do you want to get lunch? That's exactly how I see our sisterhood. So I think that's like a
[00:11:09.870] 未经允许就借我的衣服？然后就像互相抱怨一样，下一条短信就问：“你想一起吃午饭吗？” 这就是我眼中的姐妹情谊。所以我觉得这就像……
[00:11:21.870] really funny example. Oh my god, that's actually super funny. I could just imagine her being like, what the fuck are you selling all my shit? Like you're selling all my shit and you're only
[00:11:21.870] 这例子太搞笑了。我的天，真的超级搞笑。我都能想象她当时的表情，心想：你他妈在卖我的东西吗？你居然在卖我的东西，而且你只是……
[00:11:32.030] collecting like $3 for my dress. You're like, well, how much could this be? Like a dollar? It's like a used piece of clothing. Relax. So growing up, did you guys share clothes and
[00:11:32.030] 我这条裙子卖了大概3美元。你会想，这能值多少钱？一美元？它就像一件旧衣服。别紧张。所以，你们小时候，你们会和别人共用衣服吗？
[00:11:47.390] accessories and shoes and stuff often? I would say on a good day, if you asked each other, like, if I could borrow this, then yes. But on a bad day, you could have no reason as to why you would say
[00:11:47.390] 经常会借用配饰、鞋子之类的东西吗？我觉得如果一切顺利的话，比如你们互相问“我能借用一下吗？”，那当然可以。但如果情况不妙，你可能根本找不到任何理由说“我能借用一下吗？”
[00:11:59.470] no, but no meant no. And then on a really bad day is you don't even ask and then they find out. And then they will yell at you in front of all your friends or like yell at you at home when they find
[00:11:59.470] 不，但“不”就是“不”。最糟糕的情况是，你甚至都没问，他们就发现了。然后他们会在你所有朋友面前冲你大吼大叫，或者在家里冲你大吼大叫。
[00:12:13.790] out. Just based on our moods, I feel like and Connie and I both are very confrontational. Obviously having a sister means that no matter what you have them in your life. So you kind of
[00:12:13.790] 出去。就凭我们俩的心情，我觉得我和康妮都特别爱正面冲突。当然，有个姐妹意味着无论发生什么，她们都会在你身边。所以你多少会……
[00:12:24.510] also take that for granted too. And like how we like talk to each other as well. It just goes from zero to 100. I just now like think about it. It's just like funny to me because at the time,
[00:12:24.510] 也别把这当成理所当然。还有我们彼此交谈的方式。简直是瞬间从零飙升到一百。我现在才想起来。这对我来说挺搞笑的，因为当时，
[00:12:35.710] it just felt like such a bigger argument than it needed to be. Well, then who was the one to kind of extended olive branch and resolve the whole conflict? Like, how did that go down?
[00:12:35.710] 感觉这场争吵比实际需要的要激烈得多。那么，是谁主动伸出橄榄枝，化解了这场冲突呢？事情是怎么发生的？
[00:12:47.950] Probably my sister. Yeah, I was really stubborn and actually did text Connie yesterday just to give her a heads up about this podcast and just to kind of pick her brain as well on how she viewed
[00:12:47.950] 可能是我妹妹。对，我当时真的很固执，昨天还特意给康妮发了短信，就是想跟她提一下这个播客的事，也想听听她的看法。
[00:13:01.390] our childhood and the relationship that we had versus we have now. I even apologize to her because like reflecting on my past self, I feel like there was just a lot of growth that needed
[00:13:01.390] 我们的童年以及我们之间的关系，和我们现在的关系截然不同。我甚至向她道歉，因为回想过去的自己，我觉得我还有很多需要成长的地方。
[00:13:14.910] to be done. And Connie was just always very patient. She always took me as like a little sister and no matter what, like I said, she was always rooting for me. So we kind of had a nice
[00:13:14.910] 事情还没完。康妮一直都很有耐心。她总是把我当成亲妹妹一样看待，而且不管怎样，就像我说的，她总是支持我。所以我们之间相处得很好。
[00:13:26.350] talk yesterday coming from this podcast. My heart. That's so cute. I like that she really takes on that big sister role. It seems like if anything, she would just be like, it's okay. Like
[00:13:26.350] 昨天听这个播客的时候聊到这个话题，我的心都融化了。太可爱了。我喜欢她扮演姐姐的角色。感觉她好像会说，没关系。就像
[00:13:39.950] Sarah is just a little sister, like little sisters do this. Like I'll deal with it or like, you know, maybe later when everyone's cooled down, like we'll figure it out. I feel like that's very
[00:13:39.950] 莎拉只是个妹妹，就像妹妹们会做的那样。比如我会处理，或者，你知道，也许等大家都冷静下来之后，我们再想办法。我觉得这很……
[00:13:49.950] different from like my personal experience because well, one, my older sibling is a brother. And also we're like not as far apart in age. So we are almost just like siblings of the same level.
[00:13:49.950] 这跟我个人的经历不太一样，因为首先，我的哥哥是我的亲兄弟。其次，我们年龄差距也不大。所以我们几乎就像同龄的兄弟姐妹一样。
[00:14:04.030] Like no one ever truly established an older sibling vibe or like a younger sibling vibe. And it's funny too, because I think his friends think he's probably an only child and like my
[00:14:04.030] 感觉他们之间从来没有真正建立起兄长或弟妹之间的那种亲密关系。这也挺搞笑的，因为我觉得他的朋友们可能都以为他是独生子，就像我一样。
[00:14:14.910] friends, like if you like a new person meets me, they're like, oh, you must be like an only child. Right? I'm like, oh no, not, not really. So I think it's like, it's so interesting to hear how she
[00:14:14.910] 朋友们，比如如果你喜欢一个新认识的人，他们就会说，哦，你一定是独生子女吧？对吧？我就说，哦不，不是，真的不是。所以我觉得，听她讲述自己的经历真的很有意思。
[00:14:26.030] really embraces her big sister role. I agree. You mentioned that your fights were mostly centered around like, stop stealing my clothes, like don't touch my stuff. But do you think because of your similarities, did you have other arguments related to just like similar interests? Maybe something
[00:14:26.030] 她真的很享受姐姐这个角色。我同意。你提到你们的争吵大多围绕着“别偷我的衣服”、“别碰我的东西”之类的。但你觉得因为你们有很多相似之处，你们有没有因为共同的兴趣爱好而发生过其他争吵呢？或许还有其他原因。
[00:14:45.630] like it's my turn to like do this, like stop. This is something that I want to do, like stop copying me, you know, that kind of stuff? Or do you think it kind of still just centered around more
[00:14:45.630] 感觉就像轮到我了，比如停止模仿。这是我想做的，比如停止模仿我，你知道，就是那种感觉？或者你觉得它仍然围绕着更多……
[00:14:55.470] simplistic things? Yeah, most of our fights were centered around the simplistic superficial things. And although we did have overlapping interest in after school activities, I feel like our parents did a really good job on making sure that we both had what we need and didn't necessarily have to
[00:14:55.470] 都是些小事？是啊，我们大多数的争吵都是围绕着这些肤浅的小事展开的。虽然我们在课外活动方面确实有一些共同的兴趣，但我感觉我们的父母做得很好，他们确保我们俩都能得到自己需要的，而且不一定非得……
[00:15:15.870] share as much. I also think that goes back to some of the issues of maybe that underlying tone of resentment, but it's not so much directed towards me, as it was, I guess, to my parents and
[00:15:15.870] 尽可能多地分享。我也觉得这可以追溯到某种潜在的怨恨情绪，但这种怨恨与其说是针对我，不如说是针对我的父母。
[00:15:28.030] deciding if we had art classes, we would get our own sets of paints and paintbrushes and colored pencils and everything like that. I also remember when Connie first got her cell phone was the time
[00:15:28.030] 当时我们在决定，如果我们上美术课，我们会得到自己的颜料、画笔、彩色铅笔等等。我还记得康妮第一次拥有手机的时候。
[00:15:40.030] that I first got my cell phone. So she was like, you know, I'm older, how come like something so exciting, like is also shared with Sarah in that sense. But I feel like my parents always did a
[00:15:40.030] 我第一次拿到手机的时候。她就说，你知道，我年纪大了，为什么这么令人兴奋的事情，我也和莎拉分享过。但我感觉我的父母总是……
[00:15:51.150] good job balancing both of what our interests were and giving us like the tools to do it individually. So it was never an issue about like sharing everything, because our parents always provided everything we both needed. Dude, I'm like racking my brain thinking about what me and my
[00:15:51.150] 做得很好，既平衡了我们俩的兴趣，又给了我们各自实现目标的工具。所以我们从来不需要什么都分享，因为我们的父母总是能满足我们俩的需求。老兄，我绞尽脑汁地想我和我……
[00:16:10.110] brother thought about too when we were younger. And you're right. It's like it's so simplistic that I can't even remember what we fought about for a lot of things. And I think it's really
[00:16:10.110] 哥哥也想过我们小时候的事。你说得对。很多事情都太简单了，我甚至都记不清我们当时为什么吵架了。我觉得这真的很……
[00:16:20.270] interesting because you said like you had a year where you didn't really talk with your sister. And I kind of had that too. And there's like no reason really, except my brother thought I was
[00:16:20.270] 挺有意思的，因为你说你有一整年都没怎么跟你妹妹说话。我也差不多有那么一年。其实也没什么特别的原因，只是我哥觉得我……
[00:16:31.630] annoying. So he was like, just don't talk to me. I mean, that's essentially what Connie thought of me. That was annoying and rude. So yeah, and then I think I had a similar kind of cycle as you where
[00:16:31.630] 真烦人。所以他就说，别跟我说话。我的意思是，康妮基本上也是这么想我的。这很烦人，也很没礼貌。所以，是的，然后我觉得我的经历跟你差不多。
[00:16:46.510] me and my brother were super close when we were younger. And then there was like this really angsty period, I guess during high school slash college where we just like didn't really talk to
[00:16:46.510] 我和我哥哥小时候关系特别好。后来，大概是在高中/大学那会儿，我们之间有一段很叛逆的时期，我们几乎不说话。
[00:16:55.230] each other. And then as we like both started reaching a more similar time in our lives, so you know, we're both in college or like both out of college, we started rebuilding our bond almost.
[00:16:55.230] 彼此之间。然后，随着我们俩的人生阶段越来越相似，比如我们都在上大学或者都毕业了，我们几乎开始重建彼此之间的联系。
[00:17:07.470] Yeah, I wonder if that's just having an older or younger sibling and that's not really limited to just having a sister or brothers. I feel like again, it's just going back to taking for granted
[00:17:07.470] 是啊，我在想这是否只是因为有哥哥姐姐或弟弟妹妹，而不仅仅局限于有兄弟姐妹的情况。我觉得这又回到了把一切都视为理所当然的老问题上。
[00:17:21.630] that like, they're your family at the end of the day. And no matter what, they're always going to be in your life for better or for worse. So it's just knowing that in the back of your mind that
[00:17:21.630] 就像，归根结底，他们是你的家人。无论如何，无论好坏，他们都会一直陪伴在你身边。所以，你要做的就是时刻牢记这一点。
[00:17:30.910] you're not really like losing a friend if like you're going through hard periods, but things will eventually fall into place and you guys will eventually come back together. Yeah, I feel like this kind of conversation makes me think about siblinghood or maybe even just like our relationship
[00:17:30.910] 如果你正经历一段艰难时期，那其实并不像是失去了一个朋友，事情最终会好转，你们最终会重归于好。是啊，我觉得这种对话让我想到了手足之情，或者说，想到了我们之间的关系。
[00:17:48.030] with our family a little bit differently. Crystal and I do a lot of episodes on this podcast about how to nurture your friendships and how friendships kind of go in and out while you're changing life
[00:17:48.030] 我们和家人相处的方式略有不同。我和克丽丝塔尔在这个播客节目中做了很多期关于如何维系友谊以及在你人生发生变化时友谊是如何起起落落的节目。
[00:18:00.030] phases and things like that. So many things that go on in our personal lives, I think at the end of the day have a big impact on our relationships with other people. And it's crazy to think that
[00:18:00.030] 人生阶段等等。我们个人生活中发生的很多事情，我认为最终都会对我们与他人的关系产生重大影响。想到这一点，真是令人难以置信。
[00:18:09.710] familial relationships aren't immune to that because, you know, when we go from high school into college, like that's a huge life change. I can see how big changes like that are reasons why even friendships kind of drift apart or like relationships too, for example. But it's also
[00:18:09.710] 家庭关系也无法幸免，因为你知道，从高中升入大学，这可是人生中的一次巨大转变。我能理解，像这样的重大变化会导致友谊甚至恋爱关系逐渐疏远。但这也……
[00:18:26.430] interesting to see that sisterhoods can also have the same thing. Maybe in a way it's like a reminder for us to nurture and value our familial relationships as much as we think about like
[00:18:26.430] 有趣的是，姐妹情谊也能带来同样的感受。或许在某种程度上，这提醒我们要像重视家庭关系一样重视和珍惜家人之间的关系。
[00:18:37.710] friendships, for example. But maybe in another way, it's nice because at the end of the day, they'll always be your family still. Yeah, true. You know, one thing I think I did was put unfair
[00:18:37.710] 比如友谊。但从另一个角度来看，这也不错，因为归根结底，他们永远都是你的家人。是啊，没错。你知道，我觉得我做的一件事就是不公平。
[00:18:49.950] expectations on my brother. Let me know if you feel like you did this too, Sarah. But I think because like, I think in my mind, I was like, I'm the younger sibling, like my brother
[00:18:49.950] 我对哥哥抱有期望。莎拉，如果你也有过类似的经历，请告诉我。但我觉得，因为，我觉得在我的心里，我当时想的是，我是弟弟，就像我的哥哥一样。
[00:19:01.950] needs to be the older sibling, he needs to care about me and stuff. So I think because I kind of had that mindset for a while, I put unfair expectations on him. And I think that was like,
[00:19:01.950] 他需要扮演哥哥的角色，需要关心我之类的。所以我觉得，因为我之前一直有这种想法，我对他的期望过高了。我觉得那就像……
[00:19:13.470] maybe another factor in like, driving a wedge between us when we were younger. Because I thought of him as like an older brother, but not necessarily as like a person, if that makes sense. I would have to agree with you on that one, Crystal, because I've always saw
[00:19:13.470] 也许还有另一个因素，在我们小时候就造成了我们之间的隔阂。因为我当时把他当成哥哥，但未必把他当成真正的人，不知道你能不能理解我的意思。克丽丝塔尔，我同意你的看法，因为我一直都觉得
[00:19:30.750] Connie as just like this older sister figure. And growing up together, the boundaries between older and younger sister were just more defined. And as we got older, those boundaries just became more fluid. And now we're just sisters. Yeah, I think it's like a moment where you're like,
[00:19:30.750] 康妮就像个姐姐一样。我们一起长大，姐妹之间的界限一直很清晰。随着年龄增长，这种界限变得越来越模糊。现在我们就是亲姐妹了。是啊，我觉得就像是那种感觉，你会想：
[00:19:49.230] oh, wait, they're not just like my older brother, like they have a whole life going on. They have like, all their own shit too. Like, who am I to expect things of them?
[00:19:49.230] 哦，等等，他们不像我哥哥那样，他们也有自己的生活。他们也有自己的烦心事。我有什么资格对他们指手画脚呢？
[00:19:59.550] Okay, question for both of you. What do you think your lives would look like? Or your relationship with your sibling would look like if it was swapped? So if Crystal, you were the older
[00:19:59.550] 好的，问你们俩一个问题。你们觉得如果角色互换，你们的生活会是什么样子？或者说，如果你们和兄弟姐妹的关系会是什么样子？比如说，如果克丽丝塔尔，你是姐姐，你们觉得会怎么样？
[00:20:09.390] sister and same thing for you, Sarah, if you were the older sister, like how would your relationship dynamic change? Do you think you would be just like the way your sibling is now? Or would there
[00:20:09.390] 萨拉，你也是一样，如果你是姐姐，你们的关系会有什么变化？你觉得你会像现在这样对待你的兄弟姐妹吗？还是会……
[00:20:18.910] be some sort of difference? That's a crazy thought. I don't know if I would be a good older sister, to be honest. I don't know what that feels like and looks like. I much rather prefer to be the younger one, honestly. Wait, same. I'm thinking about it. Like,
[00:20:18.910] 会有什么不同吗？这想法真够疯狂的。说实话，我不知道自己能不能当个好姐姐。我不知道那是什么感觉，是什么样子。老实说，我更喜欢当妹妹。等等，我也是。我在想这个问题。比如，
[00:20:36.510] maybe I would be similar to my brother. I'd be like, what the hell? Why am I the older sibling? I'm trying to be the younger sibling too. Yeah, that's a tough question, honestly.
[00:20:36.510] 也许我会像我哥哥一样。我会想，搞什么鬼？为什么我是哥哥？我也想当弟弟啊。是啊，说实话，这真是个难题。
[00:20:46.910] Because I feel like Connie handled it as best as anyone could. Like I said, she protected me and looked out for me. She would help me. Those things were just a given in my eyes. Like I said,
[00:20:46.910] 因为我觉得康妮已经尽力处理这件事了。就像我说的，她保护我，照顾我，她会帮助我。在我看来，这些都是理所当然的。就像我说的，
[00:20:58.910] I definitely took it for granted. But I don't know if I would be able to give that back to her. I don't even know would that change my brother's personality if he were the younger sibling? Right? Maybe Connie's personality would change too if she were the younger sibling.
[00:20:58.910] 我确实把这一切都视为理所当然。但我不知道我是否还能把这些还给她。我甚至不知道，如果我哥哥是弟弟，他的性格会不会改变？对吧？也许康妮如果是妹妹，她的性格也会改变。
[00:21:18.190] That'd be scary. Honestly, I don't even want to think about it. And then maybe we'd realize like, oh shit, maybe I was a spoiled younger sibling. I remember my brother would always be like, dude, Crystal's hella spoiled. And I was like, no, I'm not.
[00:21:18.190] 那太可怕了。说实话，我都不想去想。然后我们可能会意识到，糟了，也许我就是个被宠坏的弟弟妹妹。我记得我哥哥总是说，哥们儿，克丽丝塔尔被宠坏了。我就说，才不是呢。
[00:21:34.190] We're living in the same house. The same stuff is happening to us. And then Max would always be like, no, she's spoiled as hell. Well, I guess the extension of this question too is like,
[00:21:34.190] 我们住在同一屋檐下，经历着同样的事情。但Max总是会说，不，她被宠坏了。嗯，我想这个问题也可以延伸为：
[00:21:44.350] what do you think are personality traits or even life skills that you have taken away from your relationship or experiences with your sibling? What is it about your sisterhood do you think you've learned and are able to translate into like your relationship with your friends or your parents
[00:21:44.350] 你认为从与兄弟姐妹的关系或经历中，你学到了哪些性格特质，甚至是生活技能？你认为你从姐妹情谊中学到了什么，并能将其运用到你与朋友或父母的关系中？
[00:22:03.230] or things like that? I feel like a lot of traits that I might have gotten from her were just a sense of patience with any situation, whether it's life, work, friends, things of that nature.
[00:22:03.230] 或者诸如此类的特质？我觉得我从她那里继承的很多品质，比如对任何情况的耐心，无论是生活、工作、朋友，还是其他类似的事情。
[00:22:18.190] Always being willing to lend a helping hand. I see the way that she helped my mom around the house and that also made me want to help my mom around the house. So I feel like I've definitely got that
[00:22:18.190] 她总是乐于助人。我看到她帮我妈妈做家务，这也让我很想帮妈妈做家务。所以我觉得自己肯定也具备这种品质。
[00:22:33.070] from her. Do you think there's any like maybe even hobbies and stuff that you picked up from her? Yeah. Connie was the first one to really want to take dance lessons. And so I said I wanted to take
[00:22:33.070] 从她那里。你觉得你有没有从她那里学到什么爱好之类的东西？有啊。康妮是第一个真正想学跳舞的人。所以我说我也想学。
[00:22:48.990] dance lessons. She was actually really great in ballet and it was just never my thing. So I decided to do hip hop and other forms of dance. But I feel like I'm just like repeating myself. Something
[00:22:48.990] 舞蹈课。她芭蕾跳得真的很好，但我就是不喜欢。所以我决定学嘻哈和其他舞种。但我感觉自己一直在重复自己。
[00:23:01.870] that she was great in, I didn't even try to bother at the end of the day. So that just kind of goes back to the whole academics versus arts kind of thing. But she did open up a lot of hobbies and
[00:23:01.870] 她在这方面很出色，所以我最后都没费心思去了解她。所以这其实又回到了学术和艺术之间的区别。但她的确培养了我很多爱好，而且
[00:23:15.630] after school activities for both of us, whether that is like sports or dance or art. We both took Chinese school on Saturdays and just her being able to speak a different language and being so
[00:23:15.630] 我们俩放学后都参加各种活动，比如体育、舞蹈或艺术。我们俩周六都去上中文课，她能说另一种语言，这让她感到非常荣幸。
[00:23:28.030] good at it. She's much better at speaking Chinese than I am. It's now made me regret how much lack of effort I did put into it and just seeing how she uses it in a workspace now and going back to
[00:23:28.030] 她很擅长中文。她的中文说得比我好得多。现在看到她现在在工作中如何运用中文，我后悔当初没有好好学。
[00:23:41.790] Asia with her, her like navigating Taiwan for us and you know just being able to read and speak fluently and have like really adult conversations with our family back in Taiwan. Like it's made
[00:23:41.790] 和她一起在亚洲，她就像帮我们游览台湾一样，你知道，能够流利地阅读和说中文，还能和我们在台湾的家人进行真正成人的对话。这感觉太棒了。
[00:23:55.470] me want to relearn Chinese again because I feel like I really didn't put in much effort because she was just so good at it between the both of us when we were growing up. You were like Connie
[00:23:55.470] 我想重新学习中文，因为我觉得我小时候没怎么努力，因为我们俩的中文都太好了。你就像康妮一样。
[00:24:07.870] can carry us. Yes. That's funny. I also wonder just because I think like having a brother in a stereotypical sense had certain influences on me. Well one of the interesting ones is actually my
[00:24:07.870] 可以背着我们。是的。真有趣。我也在想，因为我觉得有个兄弟（从刻板印象的角度来看）对我肯定有某些影响。其中一个有趣的影响其实是我的
[00:24:21.470] brother is like a huge reader so that inspired me actually to read a lot when I was younger. But then there's also other things like playing games and stuff. When we were growing up he would
[00:24:21.470] 哥哥是个十足的书虫，这其实也影响了我小时候的阅读习惯。不过，除了读书，还有其他事情，比如玩游戏之类的。我们小时候，他会……
[00:24:32.350] be like oh I want to play this game and he's like I guess I have no one to play with except for my like stupid younger sister. So because of that like there's some influence there where it's like oh now
[00:24:32.350] 比如，他会说“哦，我想玩这个游戏”，然后他会说“我想我除了我那笨妹妹之外没人跟我玩”。所以因为这件事，就产生了一些影响，让他觉得“哦，现在……”
[00:24:42.590] I'm like you know I enjoy playing games. I've always wondered like wow if I had a sister what hobbies I would have picked up through her potentially. Oh interesting. You were like so
[00:24:42.590] 你知道，我喜欢玩游戏。我一直很好奇，如果我有个姐姐，我会从她那里学到哪些爱好呢？哦，真有意思。你当时就像……
[00:24:54.110] different in a lot of ways too but I'm really glad you didn't do a Gen Z word of the day Crystal because I leaned much closer to being a millennial just because I had an older sister growing up
[00:24:54.110] 很多方面都不一样，但我很高兴你没有做Z世代每日一词的分享，Crystal，因为我从小就有一个姐姐，所以我觉得自己更接近千禧一代。
[00:25:06.030] in that generation. So a lot of influence of like movies and TV and music and all of that pop culture I would say I identify more as a millennial because of my sister. Another thing
[00:25:06.030] 在那一代人中，我深受电影、电视、音乐以及所有流行文化的影响。因为我姐姐的缘故，我觉得我更认同自己是千禧一代。还有一点
[00:25:19.230] is like my brother and I we talked about relationships for the first time in our lives like last year like with each other. And growing up I never talked about like boys to him because
[00:25:19.230] 就像我和我哥哥去年才第一次谈论恋爱关系一样。我从小到大从来没跟他谈过男生之类的话题，因为
[00:25:33.470] like he's a boy. Also like in my mind I was like oh he's the older brother like he should be asking me if I'm in a relationship or something he should be like protective. But he literally just
[00:25:33.470] 他就像个男孩子一样。而且我当时想，哦，他是哥哥，他应该会问我有没有男朋友之类的，他应该会保护我才对。但他真的就只是……
[00:25:45.630] like didn't care he had his own shit going on you know he wasn't interested in that. So I always have been envious because in my mind of course this might not be true for everyone but I'm like
[00:25:45.630] 他好像根本不在乎，他有自己的破事要忙，你知道，他对那些事不感兴趣。所以我一直很羡慕他，因为在我看来，当然这可能不适用于所有人，但我就是觉得……
[00:25:56.510] if I had a sister then this is like you know we had girl talk all the time. Honestly we did have girl talk. I feel like if I had an older brother I probably or even a younger brother I probably
[00:25:56.510] 如果我有个妹妹，那我们肯定会经常聊女生之间的话题。说实话，我们以前确实经常聊女生之间的话题。我觉得如果我有个哥哥，或者哪怕是个弟弟，我可能也会这样。
[00:26:09.710] wouldn't be sharing those stories with them or updates. But having an older sister I did grow up with her talking about like a lot of feelings, relationships you know just curly things like
[00:26:09.710] 我不会跟他们分享那些故事或近况。但我有个姐姐，我从小就听她谈论很多感受、人际关系之类的复杂事情。
[00:26:22.590] your body changing, makeup, fashion. I just feel like it just opens up a lot more relatability just being female. So that is one really nice aspect of having a sister. I think that if I had
[00:26:22.590] 你的身体变化、化妆、时尚。我觉得身为女性，更容易与他人产生共鸣。所以，有个姐妹真的是一件很棒的事。我想，如果我有
[00:26:37.230] a brother my relationship would look a little bit more like yours Crystal. I feel like there's something so magical about sisterhood because my mom has three sisters. Every time they see each
[00:26:37.230] 如果我有个兄弟，我和你的关系可能更像你，Crystal。我觉得姐妹情谊有一种神奇的魔力，因为我妈妈有三个姐妹。她们每次见面都会……
[00:26:50.670] other to this day it's like a party and then the husbands are kind of like add-ons you know like sometimes they're allowed but for the most part it's like girls and kids only. And I feel like
[00:26:50.670] 直到今天，这里仍然像个派对，丈夫们就像是锦上添花，你知道，有时候他们也可以来，但大多数时候只有女孩和孩子。我觉得
[00:27:02.670] it's so heartwarming to see women in like their 60s or like late 50s meet up and just like still have girl talk. Like still gossing about what's going on in town like about so-and-so's friends
[00:27:02.670] 看到六十多岁或者五十多岁的女性聚在一起，像老朋友一样聊着天，真是太暖心了。她们还会八卦镇上发生的事情，比如某某朋友的八卦。
[00:27:16.270] talking a little bit smack about your husband maybe or even your kids no one's immune. And that's just something that I feel like is hard to replicate. And it also makes me wonder if it
[00:27:16.270] 偶尔吐槽一下老公或者孩子，谁都逃不过。我觉得这种事很难复制。这也让我不禁思考，是不是……
[00:27:25.950] kind of sets you up for more natural friendships or maybe like other friendships like this with other women who aren't your sister. Are you just like primed to be like the best girl bestie ever?
[00:27:25.950] 这会让你更容易建立更自然的友谊，或者像和其他女性朋友（不是你的姐妹）一样建立友谊。你是不是已经做好了成为闺蜜的准备？
[00:27:37.470] You know what I mean? That's such an interesting thought. Yeah I never thought about it that way. And now that you bring up your mom and her sisters that kind of also just reminds me of
[00:27:37.470] 你明白我的意思吗？这真是个有趣的想法。是啊，我以前从没这么想过。现在你提起你妈妈和她的姐妹们，也让我想起了……
[00:27:48.830] my mom and her siblings. So she has an older sister and two brothers and she always said that she was closer to her sister. And because of that she wanted to give Connie me. When my parents
[00:27:48.830] 我妈妈和她的兄弟姐妹。她有一个姐姐和两个哥哥，她总是说她和姐姐最亲近。正因为如此，她才想把康妮给我。当我的父母
[00:28:02.110] brought me home from the hospital they told Connie that we have the best gift for you and then she was like what is it? She thought it was like a doll or something and it ended up being a human
[00:28:02.110] 他们把我从医院接回家，告诉康妮他们有份最好的礼物要送给我，然后她问是什么？她以为是个娃娃之类的东西，结果是个真人。
[00:28:13.470] little sister of me. And then Connie was like wait I don't want this. And now we joke about it all the time because she can finally admit she was like you know what maybe mom was right. Like having a
[00:28:13.470] 我妹妹。然后康妮就说，等等，我不想这样。现在我们经常拿这件事开玩笑，因为她终于承认她当时想的是，你知道吗，也许妈妈是对的。就像……
[00:28:24.190] sister is like so great. So yeah. So cute. Okay I have like a slightly silly question but I only ask this because I am kind of like the type of person to do this. Sometimes when I'm going through
[00:28:24.190] 我姐姐真的太棒了。真的。好可爱。好吧，我有个有点傻的问题，但我问这个问题是因为我就是那种会问这种问题的人。有时候当我经历一些事情的时候……
[00:28:39.070] something in my life or maybe put in a situation where I'm like oh god like I have no idea what to do, my mind immediately goes to like maybe like the top three people in my life or like people that
[00:28:39.070] 生活中遇到一些事，或者遇到一些让我不知所措的情况，比如“天哪，我完全不知道该怎么办”，我的脑海中会立刻浮现出我生命中最重要的三个人，或者其他一些人。
[00:28:49.150] I look up to and I'm like oh my god what would mom do? Like what would dad do? What would James do? And I'm very curious to know if you have ever encountered a situation where you're like oh
[00:28:49.150] 我仰慕他们，然后就会想，天哪，妈妈会怎么做？爸爸会怎么做？詹姆斯会怎么做？我很好奇你是否也遇到过类似的情况，让你觉得“哦……”
[00:28:59.550] shit like I have no idea what to do. Never been in this situation before. Like what would Connie do? Maybe not necessarily what would she do but I know that she would always be there to pick up
[00:28:59.550] 我完全不知道该怎么办。以前从来没遇到过这种情况。康妮会怎么做？也许她不一定会做什么，但我知道她总会在那里接我。
[00:29:11.950] the phone you know and if I told her that I was in this situation and I just needed some advice she would give it to me. Yeah I feel like Connie's one of the closest people in my life right now
[00:29:11.950] 你知道，我给她打电话，如果我告诉她我遇到了这种情况，需要一些建议，她肯定会给我。是啊，我觉得康妮现在是我生命中最亲近的人之一。
[00:29:23.070] because I can sometimes go every single day of the week facetiming her and we would talk for like two to three hours and it's just like she's like what now? But we always end up finding something to talk
[00:29:23.070] 因为我有时候一周七天都能跟她视频通话，一聊就是两三个小时，她就好像不知道该说什么了。但我们总能找到话题聊下去。
[00:29:35.710] about and just you know sharing antidotes and life updates and you know how things are going with my family because she's still at home with my parents so it's just really nice to like know that I can
[00:29:35.710] 就是聊聊一些趣事、生活近况，还有我家里的情况，因为她现在还和我父母住在一起，所以知道我可以和她聊聊真的很好。
[00:29:47.150] always lean on her and count on her for an answer and to always pick up but I wouldn't necessarily say that she gives me advice from like what would she would do but like she understands like where
[00:29:47.150] 我总是依赖她，指望她给我答案，也总是指望她接电话，但我不会说她会给我建议，比如她会怎么做，但她很理解我，知道我在哪里。
[00:29:58.910] I'm at in my life and will really understand like my situation and give me pretty good advice based on where I'm at in my life. So you're not necessarily getting WWCD? No not what would Connie do.
[00:29:58.910] 我现在的人生阶段，能真正理解我的处境，并根据我目前的人生阶段给我一些很好的建议。所以你不一定是在听“康妮会怎么做”？不，不是康妮会怎么做。
[00:30:14.110] Dude I always think it's the cutest shit when like the younger sibling calls up the older sibling and is like I need help can you give me some advice or like what should I do? I always
[00:30:14.110] 老兄，我总是觉得弟弟妹妹打电话给哥哥姐姐，问“我需要帮忙，你能给我点建议吗？”或者“我该怎么办？”这种事特别可爱。我总是
[00:30:24.750] think that's really sweet it really shows like the level of trust and powerful bond between the siblings. I don't do that in my sibling ship. Okay so I do want to circle back really quick to
[00:30:24.750] 我觉得这真的很温馨，这充分展现了兄弟姐妹之间深厚的信任和牢固的感情。我自己的兄弟姐妹之间可不会这样。好的，我想快速地回到刚才的话题。
[00:30:38.780] the experience of growing up with a sister in your childhood and something that I'm super curious about is is there stuff that you would only share with Connie and it would be kind of like a sister
[00:30:38.780] 童年时期和姐姐一起长大的经历，以及我非常好奇的一点是，你是否会有一些只和康妮分享的事情，就像和亲姐妹一样。
[00:30:50.060] secret that you wouldn't then go and tell your parents and is that something that you feel like was exclusive to childhood or something that you guys still do to this day? Yeah I feel like when
[00:30:50.060] 你小时候会保守一个秘密，不会告诉父母。你觉得这种秘密是童年时期独有的，还是你们现在仍然会保留的？嗯，我觉得……
[00:31:00.060] it came to relationships and like boys and things like that it still is very much and was I would only share that with Connie and not so much my parents or like feeling insecure about grades and
[00:31:00.060] 谈到恋爱关系，比如男生之类的事情，现在依然如此，而且过去我只会和康妮分享这些，而不会和父母分享，比如对成绩的不安全感等等。
[00:31:16.620] college and things like that. I feel like my parents wouldn't really necessarily understand as much as Connie would since she's gone through it. Connie and I also have just the shared mutual understanding we know what each other's thinking not necessarily like twin telepathy or anything
[00:31:16.620] 大学之类的。我觉得我父母可能不像康妮那样能理解，毕竟她经历过这些。我和康妮之间也有一种默契，我们知道对方在想什么，虽然不是那种双胞胎心灵感应之类的。
[00:31:33.580] but I feel like it's just like growing up with each other and like being in each other's like orbit that you pick up on certain things about each other that you just have a mutual unspoken
[00:31:33.580] 但我感觉就像是一起长大，彼此之间就像在同一个轨道上，你会注意到对方的某些特质，从而产生一种无需言说的默契。
[00:31:45.180] understanding. Growing up like my parents would if they were trying to communicate with each other around the dinner table and like they didn't want us to like hear what they were talking about they
[00:31:45.180] 理解。就像我父母那样长大，如果他们在餐桌上试图交流，却不想让我们听到他们在说什么，他们就会……
[00:31:55.980] would then switch to Taiwanese so that Connie and I couldn't understand it. So Connie and I agreed to take French together so that we could have our own language that my parents didn't understand.
[00:31:55.980] 然后他们就改说台语，这样我和康妮就听不懂了。所以我和康妮决定一起学法语，这样我们就能拥有父母听不懂的语言了。
[00:32:09.020] So I always thought that was funny and of course Connie still knows French and I don't. That's so cute though and I feel like that's such a good and true example of like close sibling bond
[00:32:09.020] 所以我一直觉得这很有趣，当然，康妮现在还会说法语，而我不会。不过这真的很可爱，我觉得这是兄弟姐妹之间亲密关系的一个非常好的真实例子。
[00:32:22.540] and as you mentioned before I think just the fact that you're both women I think it like knocks down a layer of extra work maybe to be relatable to each other. You know things like sharing the same
[00:32:22.540] 正如你之前提到的，我觉得你们都是女性这一点，或许能帮你们省去一些额外的沟通障碍，让彼此更容易产生共鸣。比如，分享相同的经历。
[00:32:36.940] room up until Connie left for college I feel like that is such a valuable experience. I mean maybe not in the moment because you're like I have to share this room with my sister but like I think
[00:32:36.940] 直到康妮上大学之前，我们一直住在一起，我觉得那是一段非常宝贵的经历。我的意思是，也许当时感觉不到，因为你会想“我得和妹妹合住一个房间”，但我觉得……
[00:32:49.660] over time you realize like oh wow like we learned so much from each other just because we're like always near each other and like I'm sure that's the perfect formula as well. Late night talks you're
[00:32:49.660] 随着时间的推移，你会意识到，哇，我们彼此学到了这么多，就因为我们总是形影不离，而且我确信这也是个完美的秘诀。深夜长谈……
[00:33:00.940] like oh my god like this is going on in my life or like oh my god like let's talk about boys until like 1am. It's like having a sleepover every single day with what could be your best friend right?
[00:33:00.940] 天哪，这简直就是我生活中正在发生的事情！或者，天哪，我们聊男生聊到凌晨一点！这就像每天都和自己最好的朋友一起过夜一样，对吧？
[00:33:11.100] Yeah it's just pillow talk at night and also understanding each other's like habits and what their schedules are and things like that. I feel like all of those instances are data points in a larger bank of like closeness if that makes sense. For sure. If you could pinpoint
[00:33:11.100] 是啊，就是晚上睡前聊聊天，了解彼此的习惯、作息时间等等。我觉得这些都像是亲密关系的缩影，不知道你能不能理解。当然。如果你能具体指出……
[00:33:33.100] maybe like one or just like a generic thing that you think is like the most valuable that you've gotten out of like your sisterhood? I think it's a culmination of everything but I would say what
[00:33:33.100] 或许可以举个例子，或者说一个你认为从姐妹情谊中获得的最宝贵的东西？我觉得这是所有因素的综合，但我想说的是……
[00:33:47.340] I value the most right now is where I'm at in my relationship with Connie now because I feel like we have a better understanding of each other and what is kind of off limits to talk about what we
[00:33:47.340] 我现在最珍惜的就是我和康妮的关系，因为我觉得我们彼此更加了解，也更清楚哪些话题是禁忌，哪些话题是不能说的。
[00:34:00.460] should focus and like redirect our energy on when it comes to each other. And just also her being at home and still like with my parents I appreciate that she's able to provide updates to me and like
[00:34:00.460] 我们应该把精力集中在彼此身上，重新分配精力。而且，她待在家里，还和我父母在一起，我很感激她能随时向我汇报情况。
[00:34:14.460] able to take care of my parents in a lot of ways that I can't. It's also interesting that even though we're separated by distance now I actually feel closer to her and makes me look forward to
[00:34:14.460] 她能在很多我做不到的地方照顾我的父母。有趣的是，虽然我们现在分隔两地，但我反而感觉和她更亲近了，这让我更加期待……
[00:34:29.820] hearing from her and like catching up with her and just getting updates on what she's doing, her friends, family. So I feel like I just value the build-up. We did have some issues growing up
[00:34:29.820] 收到她的消息，和她聊聊近况，了解她的近况、她的朋友和家人，我觉得这很有意义。我们成长过程中确实遇到过一些问题。
[00:34:44.140] with each other but now I think we're just in a much more understanding place that we're able to truly appreciate what sisterhood means. We talk about like future plans of you know where we're
[00:34:44.140] 我们以前彼此之间有过隔阂，但现在我觉得我们彼此更加理解，能够真正体会到姐妹情谊的意义。我们会聊聊未来的计划，你知道的，我们……
[00:34:56.620] going to live and what being an aunt looks like once we have kids and the type of like aunt and sister that we want our kids to have. So it's just really nice to see that things are finally coming
[00:34:56.620] 我们会一起生活，思考有了孩子之后当姑姑/姨妈会是什么样子，以及我们希望孩子拥有怎样的姑姑/姨妈和姐姐/姐姐。所以，看到这一切终于开始有了进展，真的很高兴。
[00:35:10.140] together even despite like the hard patches and her getting over me selling her clothes. Iconic. Well I really loved that you were able to open up with us so much today about your
[00:35:10.140] 即使经历了艰难时期，即使她难以接受我卖掉她的衣服，我们仍然在一起。这真是太经典了。我真的很高兴你今天能和我们敞开心扉地谈论你的这些事。
[00:35:23.180] relationship with your sister. It sounds like it's in such a good spot and it does sound like life moves on after you sell your sister's clothes so there's hope out there for anyone in a tumultuous
[00:35:23.180] 你和姐姐的关系听起来很好，而且卖掉姐姐的衣服后，生活似乎也继续向前发展，所以对于任何身处困境的人来说，都还有希望。
