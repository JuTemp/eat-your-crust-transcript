[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Jessica.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo，我是Jessica。
[00:00:16.640]  Welcome back, Jessica. The last episode Jessica joined us on was episode 204 Girl Talk Healthy
[00:00:16.640] 欢迎回来，杰西卡。杰西卡上次参加我们的节目是第204期“女孩健康谈话”。
[00:00:23.680]  Relationships. This week we have a less exciting topic to talk about, but in Jessica's eyes I think it's very exciting.
[00:00:23.680] 人际关系。这周我们要聊的话题可能没那么刺激，但在杰西卡看来，我觉得非常精彩。
[00:00:32.240]  This is like a roast.
[00:00:32.240] 这简直就是一场烤肉大战。
[00:00:35.200]  Well no, that's why you're the perfect guess for this topic.
[00:00:35.200] 不，正因为如此，你才是这个话题的最佳人选。
[00:00:38.960]  Okay, I'm honored.
[00:00:38.960] 好的，我感到非常荣幸。
[00:00:42.000]  But before we get to all of that, we do have a slang word to discuss and this one is funny because
[00:00:42.000] 但在此之前，我们先来讨论一个俚语，这个俚语很有趣，因为
[00:00:48.280]  Jeesoo and I use this a lot sometimes with our friends and
[00:00:48.280] Jeesoo和我有时经常和朋友们一起用这个，
[00:00:53.520]  some of them don't know what it is so they'll be like, wait, what?
[00:00:53.520] 他们中有些人不知道那是什么，所以他们会说，等等，什么？
[00:00:57.280]  This word really had its moment maybe like a couple years ago now. Nowadays the usage has died down
[00:00:57.280] 这个词大概在几年前确实流行过一阵子。现在它的使用频率已经下降了。
[00:01:03.920]  but I still think it's a really funny word and I'm sure Jeesoo can agree.
[00:01:03.920] 但我仍然觉得这个词很有趣，我相信 Jeesoo 也会同意。
[00:01:07.920]  So the word is
[00:01:07.920] 所以这个词是
[00:01:09.680]  malding.
[00:01:09.680] 发芽。
[00:01:11.360]  Essentially this word is a mixture of mad and balding. So you can kind of
[00:01:11.360] 这个词本质上是“疯狂”和“秃顶”的组合。所以你可以这么说。
[00:01:18.400]  guess what the definition is
[00:01:18.400] 猜猜它的定义是什么？
[00:01:21.600]  Hopefully. Dude, I love this word. I think of the slang words that I use
[00:01:21.600] 但愿如此。老兄，我太喜欢这个词了。我想起了我常用的那些俚语。
[00:01:26.000]  It's one of my top five most used slang words and I feel like it's just so funny because
[00:01:26.000] 这是我最常用的五个俚语之一，我觉得它特别搞笑，因为
[00:01:31.360]  I'm sure everyone can relate to that moment where you're so angry so upset about something
[00:01:31.360] 我相信每个人都能体会到那种因为某件事而又生气又难过的时刻。
[00:01:35.680]  That it makes you want to like pull your hair out and to me that's kind of like what best illustrates malding
[00:01:35.680] 它让人抓狂，恨不得把头发都拔光，对我来说，这大概就是最能体现“发脾气”的体现了。
[00:01:41.200]  That's like the vision I have in my head too. Like you're so angry. You're tugging at your hair
[00:01:41.200] 我脑海里浮现的也是这样的画面。你非常生气，揪着自己的头发。
[00:01:45.920]  You know, you're becoming bald because of how angry you are
[00:01:45.920] 你知道吗，你因为太生气而快要秃顶了。
[00:01:49.360]  I feel like as intuitive in a sense it sounds
[00:01:49.360] 我觉得这听起来很直观。
[00:01:54.640]  I do also feel like this word can be a little bit interesting or hard to decipher until you actually hear the words mad and bald together
[00:01:54.640] 我也觉得这个词有点意思，或者说有点难懂，直到你真正听到“mad”（疯狂的）和“bald”（秃头）这两个词连在一起。
[00:02:01.840]  So I can definitely think of multiple times where people are like, wait, what?
[00:02:01.840] 所以我肯定能想到很多次人们会说：“等等，什么？”
[00:02:06.160]  What did you say?
[00:02:06.160]  你说什么？
[00:02:07.280]  And then you like explain the word to them and I feel like it always makes people laugh
[00:02:07.280] 然后你跟他们解释这个词，我觉得这总是能逗人发笑。
[00:02:10.720]  So that in a sense is also a good slang word because I think people are receptive to it
[00:02:10.720] 所以从某种意义上说，这也是个不错的俚语，因为我觉得人们很容易接受它。
[00:02:15.280]  They're like, this is a creative word. I think it's a very easy word
[00:02:15.280] 他们说，这个词很有创意。我觉得这个词很简单。
[00:02:19.280]  To use I definitely heard it for the first time from you Jisoo
[00:02:19.280] 我第一次听到这个词肯定是从你Jisoo那里听到的。
[00:02:22.960]  Me and my boyfriend Vince. We have just like gone and ran wild with it
[00:02:22.960] 我和我的男朋友文斯。我们简直玩疯了。
[00:02:28.640]  We heard it from you the first time we try to put as many twists on it as possible
[00:02:28.640] 我们第一次就从你们那里听到了，我们试图尽可能地给它添加各种变化。
[00:02:33.680]  I think sometimes it just depends on the situation, but sometimes Vince will be like
[00:02:33.680] 我觉得有时候这取决于具体情况，但有时候文斯会说：
[00:02:37.920]  I didn't go running today. He runs normally and he's like, I had a really bad run
[00:02:37.920] 我今天没跑步。他平时跑步很正常，但他却说：“我今天跑得特别糟糕。”
[00:02:42.480]  And I was folding. That's like slow fat and balding
[00:02:42.480] 我当时正在崩溃。那就像缓慢的肥胖和秃顶。
[00:02:49.680]  It's just like you just try to put as many adjectives in there
[00:02:49.680] 就好像你只想尽可能多地往里面塞形容词一样。
[00:02:56.080]  Like it's own format
[00:02:56.080] 就像它自己的格式
[00:02:58.160]  Exactly
[00:02:58.160]  确切地
[00:02:59.440]  It's its own formula now for us. So I do really love this word
[00:02:59.440] 现在它对我们来说已经有了自己的独特模式。所以我真的很喜欢这个词。
[00:03:04.480]  Oh, that's so funny
[00:03:04.480] 哦，这太搞笑了
[00:03:06.400]  I feel like it's just spur of the moment
[00:03:06.400] 我觉得这纯粹是临时起意。
[00:03:08.400]  Whatever it is that we're doing it's there. It's there as our formula
[00:03:08.400] 无论我们在做什么，它都在那里。它就是我们的公式。
[00:03:11.440]  Just add the old thing at the end
[00:03:11.440] 只需把旧的东西加到最后即可
[00:03:12.720]  Yeah
[00:03:12.720]  是的
[00:03:13.840]  Anything as many adjectives as you can combine into one just like the first letter just slap it in there
[00:03:13.840] 把尽可能多的形容词组合成一个词，就像第一个字母一样，直接放进去。
[00:03:19.680]  Oh my god, I love that dude. That's the fucking power and the magic of malding
[00:03:19.680] 我的天哪，我太喜欢那家伙了。这就是马丁的魅力和魔力。
[00:03:25.520]  It births new memes
[00:03:25.520] 它催生了新的模因
[00:03:28.800]  I think that's so funny because it is kind of like a representation of twitch
[00:03:28.800] 我觉得这太搞笑了，因为它有点像是抽搐的体现。
[00:03:35.920]  Because a lot of twitch slang
[00:03:35.920] 因为很多 Twitch 俚语
[00:03:38.640]  Which you know some of these are born from malding. I think also got really big on twitch
[00:03:38.640] 你知道，其中一些就是从恶搞中诞生的。我觉得它们在 Twitch 上也火了起来。
[00:03:43.760]  And a lot of these slang words or memes or whatever they evolve and just become like more and more degenerate
[00:03:43.760] 很多俚语、梗图之类的东西都会不断演变，变得越来越堕落。
[00:03:50.640]  And so I feel like yeah malding is the perfect example. It's so funny that
[00:03:50.640] 所以我觉得，没错，发脾气就是个完美的例子。这太搞笑了。
[00:03:55.520]  You two are just like creating different versions of malting
[00:03:55.520] 你们俩就像是在创造不同版本的麦芽制作工艺。
[00:04:00.400]  It's definitely a change of the game for us in certain situations
[00:04:00.400] 在某些情况下，这无疑会改变我们的比赛格局。
[00:04:05.280]  I need to keep track of like a list and just start using them. Oh my god. I thought of a funny one
[00:04:05.280] 我需要列个清单，然后开始用它们。我的天哪。我想到一个搞笑的例子。
[00:04:11.600]  Shalding sleepy hungry and balding
[00:04:11.600] 秃顶、困倦、饥饿、秃顶
[00:04:17.040]  Wait, I feel that one on the daily like me every morning
[00:04:17.040] 等等，我每天早上都有这种感觉，就像我每天早上一样。
[00:04:22.400]  I looked up malding though for our you know word origin purposes and what I found was very interesting on our favorite website
[00:04:22.400] 我查了一下“malding”这个词，主要是想探究它的词源，结果在我们最喜欢的网站上发现了一些非常有趣的内容。
[00:04:30.880]  knowyourmeme.com
[00:04:30.880] knowyourmeme.com
[00:04:32.720]  They said the origin is actually at least the first traceable origin is from 2011
[00:04:32.720] 他们说，至少最早可追溯的来源可以追溯到2011年。
[00:04:39.760]  In urban dictionary someone defined malding as
[00:04:39.760] 在 Urban Dictionary 中，有人将 malding 定义为
[00:04:43.920]  Someone who is either a mad and bald person or a person who is mad about being bald
[00:04:43.920] 要么是又疯又秃的人，要么是对秃头这件事感到愤怒的人。
[00:04:49.920]  So it was actually like a noun before like mald the popularized one is a verb like malding
[00:04:49.920] 所以它以前其实是个名词，比如 mald，而现在流行的是动词，比如 malding。
[00:04:58.160]  I think I like the malding spin-off more in the screen capture of this original urban dictionary definition
[00:04:58.160] 我觉得我更喜欢这张原始城市词典定义截图中显示的“malding”衍生词。
[00:05:04.640]  The like sentence example is like you're so mald and I think it just doesn't hit
[00:05:04.640] 这个例句就像“你太生气了”，我觉得它表达得不太恰当。
[00:05:08.960]  I'm fucking malding. It's way harder than you're so mald
[00:05:08.960] 我他妈要发火了。这比你生气要严重得多。
[00:05:13.120]  I think also because the verb it's like anyone can use it right?
[00:05:13.120] 我觉得也是因为这个动词，感觉任何人都可以用它，对吧？
[00:05:16.800]  It's like i'm so angry that i'm pulling my hair out versus like mald feels more
[00:05:16.800] 感觉就像我气得要抓狂，而马尔德给我的感觉更像是……
[00:05:22.240]  pointed towards people who are bald which is a little more
[00:05:22.240] 指的是秃顶的人，这有点……
[00:05:26.160]  niche and
[00:05:26.160] 小众和
[00:05:27.600]  Targeted kind of aggressive
[00:05:27.600] 有针对性的攻击
[00:05:29.600]  Yeah, kind of mean right
[00:05:29.600] 是啊，有点刻薄吧。
[00:05:31.760]  Yeah, I definitely appreciate almost the self-differentatory usage of malding rather than the insulting version
[00:05:31.760] 是的，我非常欣赏“malding”这个词近乎自嘲式的用法，而不是侮辱性的用法。
[00:05:39.200]  Agreed. Well one thing that I think makes a lot of people mald is actually our topic today
[00:05:39.200] 同意。嗯，我觉得让很多人不高兴的一件事，其实就是我们今天的话题。
[00:05:48.080]  Well, actually maybe only parts of our topic today make people mald
[00:05:48.080] 其实，或许只有我们今天讨论的话题的一部分会让人感到不快。
[00:05:52.080]  Our overall topic is the quote unquote boring side of adulting
[00:05:52.080] 我们今天的主题是“成人生活中无聊的一面”。
[00:05:56.800]  So more of the paperwork like self-care planning being a real human kind of aspect of
[00:05:56.800] 因此，像自我护理计划这样的文书工作更多地体现了人性化的一面。
[00:06:04.560]  adulthood
[00:06:04.560] 成年期
[00:06:05.360]  I feel like this one is interesting too because being an adult is something you fantasize about when you're young
[00:06:05.360] 我觉得这个也很有意思，因为小时候我们常常会幻想自己长大成人。
[00:06:11.200]  But I feel like the parts and pieces that you fantasize about are not the administrative aspects of it
[00:06:11.200] 但我感觉你幻想中的那些部分和细节并非它的行政管理方面。
[00:06:16.880]  I was more thinking of myself in like a pantsuit and like high heels
[00:06:16.880] 我当时更多地是在想象自己穿裤装和高跟鞋的样子。
[00:06:21.040]  Walking to work with like a briefcase in my hand
[00:06:21.040] 我提着公文包去上班
[00:06:23.680]  But I was not envisioning myself cleaning the house or doing taxes and things like that
[00:06:23.680] 但我并没有设想自己会去打扫房子或者报税之类的事情。
[00:06:28.880]  So it is kind of interesting to get the rest into this position as an adult where you're like, oh, shit
[00:06:28.880] 所以，让其他人也像成年人一样处于这种境地，你会觉得，哦，糟了，这挺有意思的。
[00:06:34.400]  There's so many different things that I have to like maintain in life and so many things that I have to plan for etc
[00:06:34.400] 生活中有很多不同的事情需要我去维持，也有很多事情需要我去计划等等。
[00:06:40.640]  So I am very excited to talk to you guys about going through that aspect of adulthood
[00:06:40.640] 所以我很兴奋能和大家聊聊成年时期的这个方面。
[00:06:46.240]  So what do you think is your like least favorite adulting task?
[00:06:46.240] 那么，你觉得你最不喜欢的成年人日常任务是什么？
[00:06:51.120]  I think back when I had a car, I would say that it was probably car stuff
[00:06:51.120] 回想我以前有车的时候，我觉得那大概就是汽车用品吧。
[00:06:57.280]  Going to get your oil changed or rotate your tires, which in the
[00:06:57.280] 准备去换机油或者轮换轮胎，这在……
[00:07:03.440]  Four years that I drove my car. I didn't do once so that was probably bad
[00:07:03.440] 我开了四年车。一次都没出过事故，这可能不太好。
[00:07:10.960]  And I think just doing car stuff is also very intimidating for like a woman
[00:07:10.960] 我觉得对女性来说，做汽车相关的事情也很让人望而生畏。
[00:07:16.880]  And making sure that I'm not getting scammed but then also at the same time, you know, they're telling you
[00:07:16.880] 他们既要确保我不被骗，同时，你知道，他们还要告诉你
[00:07:22.160]  Oh, you need to get this change. It looks like it needs to be changed. So I'm like, well damn like maybe I should pay for it then
[00:07:22.160] 哦，你需要找零钱。看起来确实需要换一下。所以我就想，好吧，看来我得付钱了。
[00:07:29.600]  Yeah, I feel like car stuff for me was probably my least favorite part
[00:07:29.600] 是的，我觉得汽车相关的部分大概是我最不喜欢的了。
[00:07:34.320]  And now that I don't have a car
[00:07:34.320] 现在我没有车了。
[00:07:36.720]  That's gone. So thank god
[00:07:36.720] 那东西已经没了。感谢上帝。
[00:07:38.640]  But I think after that surprisingly enough although I do love doing my taxes
[00:07:38.640] 但令人惊讶的是，在那之后，尽管我确实很喜欢报税，但我觉得情况却并非如此。
[00:07:42.880]  I actually really don't enjoy doing other finance related
[00:07:42.880] 我其实并不喜欢做其他与金融相关的工作。
[00:07:47.600]  For example my 401k that I had with my previous company
[00:07:47.600] 例如，我在前一家公司拥有的401k退休账户。
[00:07:51.520]  It was through vanguard and then through my current company. My 401k now is through fidelity
[00:07:51.520] 我最初是通过先锋集团（Vanguard）开户的，后来通过我现在的公司开户。我现在的401k计划是通过富达投资（Fidelity）开的。
[00:07:58.560]  And so I had set up this whole like rollover
[00:07:58.560] 所以我设置了整个类似滚动的效果。
[00:08:02.080]  Roth IRA account for me to like transfer all of my funds that were in vanguard to fidelity
[00:08:02.080] 我需要将我在 Vanguard 的所有资金转移到 Fidelity，开设一个 Roth IRA 账户。
[00:08:07.520]  And it's been two years and I haven't done it. So
[00:08:07.520] 已经两年了，我还没做。
[00:08:09.680]  Oh my god, there's that
[00:08:09.680] 我的天哪，还有那个
[00:08:11.440]  Dude, wait, I have the same thing except the opposite of you like fidelity to vanguard
[00:08:11.440] 兄弟，等等，我的情况跟你一样，只不过我的情况跟你相反，就像我把忠诚度换成了先锋集团。
[00:08:16.800]  And it's been like three years and I still haven't I put it on my to-do list in the beginning of every year
[00:08:16.800] 已经三年了，我还是没做完。我每年年初都会把它列入待办事项清单。
[00:08:23.520]  Like don't forget to do the rollover this year. And then I always forget
[00:08:23.520] 比如别忘了今年要进行余额结转。但我总是忘记。
[00:08:28.240]  And it's gone so bad that I have to pay like a fee on it now like a fee
[00:08:28.240] 情况变得这么糟糕，我现在都得为此支付一笔费用了。
[00:08:32.880]  Yeah, because it's like you're not with that company anymore. So you have to pay like a small fee to keep that account alive
[00:08:32.880] 是啊，因为你好像已经不再是那家公司的员工了。所以你得交点小费才能维持账户有效。
[00:08:39.600]  Yeah, and I was like, oh shoot. I really need to like roll this over soon
[00:08:39.600] 是啊，我当时就想，糟了。我真得赶紧把它翻过来。
[00:08:43.440]  I actually haven't even like gone into vanguard and looked at it
[00:08:43.440] 我其实还没进去看过先锋联盟呢。
[00:08:48.320]  Since setting that up. So I don't even I'm probably paying a fee
[00:08:48.320] 自从设置好之后，我甚至不知道我可能要付钱。
[00:08:51.360]  But I just I haven't even gone and looked at it. So
[00:08:51.360] 但我还没去看呢。
[00:08:55.600]  I think the only thing I went to look at was if I have to pay a fee to my new fidelity account
[00:08:55.600] 我当时唯一想了解的就是我的新富达账户是否需要支付费用。
[00:09:01.440]  If I don't have any money in there like it's just literally a balance of zeros
[00:09:01.440] 如果我账户里一分钱都没有，余额就是一堆零。
[00:09:05.360]  I'm like, do I need to pay a fee for this and that was a no. So then I think after I saw that I was like, okay
[00:09:05.360] 我当时就想，我需要为此付费吗？答案是不用。所以，看到之后我就想，好吧。
[00:09:10.400]  That's fine. I'll just deal with it later
[00:09:10.400] 没关系，我稍后再处理。
[00:09:14.640]  I think like the fee is not too bad
[00:09:14.640] 我觉得这个费用还算可以接受。
[00:09:16.800]  But it's just the fact that you're paying the fee out of your account. You're like, oh shoot
[00:09:16.800] 但问题就在于，这笔费用是从你的账户里扣除的。你会想，糟了。
[00:09:20.400]  Like I really need to move this to the non-fee account now
[00:09:20.400] 我真的需要现在就把这个账户转到免手续费账户里。
[00:09:24.640]  I feel like along those lines though. I can totally relate to
[00:09:24.640] 我感觉自己也有这种感觉。我完全能理解。
[00:09:28.640]  I think even stuff like insurance
[00:09:28.640] 我觉得就连保险之类的东西也一样。
[00:09:31.120]  I just hate dealing with and I kind of have a feeling that it's like stuff
[00:09:31.120] 我就是讨厌处理这些事，而且我总觉得这有点像……
[00:09:35.120]  That's set up through your work. Maybe it's just inconvenient sometimes or less intuitive
[00:09:35.120] 这是通过你的工作安排实现的。也许有时候会觉得不太方便或者不够直观。
[00:09:40.560]  And I hate having to go in and like pick my insurance every year
[00:09:40.560] 我讨厌每年都要去选保险。
[00:09:45.520]  I don't want to do the research
[00:09:45.520] 我不想做这项研究
[00:09:46.880]  Surely there's one optimal decision that someone can make for me
[00:09:46.880] 肯定有人能替我做出一个最佳决定。
[00:09:50.000]  Like why do I have to custom fit this to my own life?
[00:09:50.000] 为什么我非得把它根据自己的生活情况来定制呢？
[00:09:54.320]  Yeah, I feel like car stuff always just like sneaks up onto you late last year
[00:09:54.320] 是啊，我觉得汽车方面的问题总是会在去年底悄悄地找上门来。
[00:09:59.680]  I had my registration sticker arrive in the mail and I was like, oh, I better put this on soon
[00:09:59.680] 我的车辆登记贴纸寄到了，我心想，哎呀，我最好尽快把它贴上去。
[00:10:05.840]  But I double checked. I was like, oh, I don't need to put it on till the end of the month
[00:10:05.840] 但我又确认了一遍。我想，哦，我月底之前都不需要戴。
[00:10:08.880]  So I just like kept putting it off, you know
[00:10:08.880] 所以我就一直拖着没做，你知道的。
[00:10:11.840]  And it's like the simplest task. I just had to peel the sticker off
[00:10:11.840] 这简直是最简单的任务。我只需要把贴纸撕下来就行了。
[00:10:15.920]  Stick it on and like put the paper into my car
[00:10:15.920] 把它贴上去，然后把纸放进我的车里。
[00:10:18.880]  But I was just like no like I'll have to wipe it and everything
[00:10:18.880] 但我当时就想，不行，我得把它擦干净什么的。
[00:10:22.640]  I'll do it when I'm more prepared. Dude. I actually don't even wipe mine
[00:10:22.640] 等我准备得更充分些再说吧。老兄，我其实根本不擦屁股。
[00:10:26.240]  I just like put it on and you know how you can have like a little border around your license plate
[00:10:26.240] 我只是喜欢把它装上去，你知道，这样你的车牌周围就能有个小小的边框了。
[00:10:31.200]  Usually I think normal people would take it off and then put their sticker on and then put the border back on
[00:10:31.200] 通常情况下，我觉得正常人会先把边框取下来，贴上自己的贴纸，然后再把边框装回去。
[00:10:36.080]  I honestly have just been putting it over my border for the last couple years
[00:10:36.080] 说实话，过去几年我一直都只是把它放在我的边境线上。
[00:10:40.160]  Wait, I didn't know people wiped it
[00:10:40.160] 等等，我不知道有人会擦拭它。
[00:10:43.040]  Never wiped it in my life
[00:10:43.040] 这辈子都没擦过它
[00:10:44.640]  I think it's just like it helps of it to get some of the dust off so it'll stick better
[00:10:44.640] 我觉得这样做有助于去除一些灰尘，让它粘得更牢。
[00:10:49.360]  So I've actually also learned a good tip is
[00:10:49.360] 所以，我还学到了一个很有用的技巧：
[00:10:52.560]  You score it like you put it on and then you use a
[00:10:52.560] 你像穿衣服一样给它划线，然后使用
[00:10:56.320]  Exacto knife and kind of cut it in half or something just so people can't steal it
[00:10:56.320] 用美工刀把它切成两半之类的，这样别人就偷不走了。
[00:11:01.360]  But low-key people could just steal your whole license plate. So like oh, you know
[00:11:01.360] 但一些行事低调的人可能会直接偷走你的整个车牌。所以，你知道的。
[00:11:05.920]  True. Yeah, my old car was from 1999
[00:11:05.920] 没错。是啊，我的旧车是1999年的。
[00:11:09.760]  So I'm pretty sure the stickers was just like 20
[00:11:09.760] 所以我很确定那些贴纸大概只有20个。
[00:11:15.040]  22 23 years of just
[00:11:15.040] 仅仅22、23年
[00:11:18.000]  sticker after sticker and it was like this inch lick I swear so
[00:11:18.000] 一张接一张的贴纸，感觉就像舔了一寸一寸的距离，我发誓。
[00:11:22.480]  I don't think
[00:11:22.480] 我不认为
[00:11:24.080]  Anybody before me who had that car
[00:11:24.080] 在我之前拥有那辆车的人
[00:11:28.240]  To do anything about it
[00:11:28.240] 对此采取任何行动
[00:11:29.520]  I wonder if people actually peel off their previous year sticker. I feel like that's so much work
[00:11:29.520] 我很好奇大家是不是真的会把去年的贴纸撕掉。感觉撕掉贴纸好费劲啊。
[00:11:34.800]  I feel like it's kind of hard to take off now. Yeah, it feels like it's so like sticky
[00:11:34.800] 我觉得现在很难脱下来。是啊，感觉黏糊糊的。
[00:11:39.200]  Because I'm just thinking like yeah
[00:11:39.200] 因为我当时就想，嗯。
[00:11:40.560]  What if you have an old car like your old car and you just have like this one inch thick pad of stickers, you know
[00:11:40.560] 如果你有一辆旧车，就像你那辆旧车一样，而你只有一英寸厚的贴纸垫，你知道吗？
[00:11:47.600]  Maybe it's actually easier to take off at that point
[00:11:47.600] 或许那时起飞反而更容易。
[00:11:49.680]  Oh, instead of having to like you know so thin you like dig your nail and you just like just comes off as a chunk
[00:11:49.680] 哦，不用像那种薄得像指甲抠进去一样，一抠就掉下来一大块。
[00:11:55.680]  Yeah, car stuff is annoying
[00:11:55.680] 是啊，汽车方面的事情真烦人。
[00:11:57.680]  And I feel like home stuff has also seemed slightly annoying to me after james and I bought our house
[00:11:57.680] 自从我和詹姆斯买了房子之后，我觉得家里的事也变得有点烦人了。
[00:12:04.640]  Because before I felt like we were always living in an apartment
[00:12:04.640] 因为以前我觉得我们一直都住在公寓里。
[00:12:08.160]  So the only things that I dreamed of was like, oh, it would be so nice to have
[00:12:08.160] 所以我唯一梦想的就是，哦，如果能拥有它该有多好啊。
[00:12:12.240]  A place with a garden and a place where I don't have to park in like this huge parking garage
[00:12:12.240] 一个带花园的地方，而且不用像现在这样把车停在巨大的停车场里。
[00:12:17.680]  All these things that I considered benefits
[00:12:17.680] 所有这些都是我认为的好处
[00:12:20.480]  But when it comes to actually owning a home
[00:12:20.480] 但说到真正拥有一套房子，情况就完全不同了。
[00:12:22.720]  I feel like the thing that I noticed on the daily is like, oh, I need to fix this part of the house
[00:12:22.720] 我感觉自己每天都会注意到一些事情，比如，哦，我需要修理房子的这部分。
[00:12:26.800]  And I need to like add this and hopefully one day we can remodel and do this
[00:12:26.800] 我还需要补充一点，希望有一天我们能进行改造并完成这件事。
[00:12:30.000]  So it's just like this long laundry list that I feel like never gets shorter and always only gets longer
[00:12:30.000] 所以，这就像一张长长的待洗衣物清单，感觉永远不会变短，只会越来越长。
[00:12:35.280]  So home maintenance stuff. I think has been a huge
[00:12:35.280] 所以，房屋维护方面的事情。我认为这一直非常重要。
[00:12:38.960]  Part of our like personal to-do list for us. That's funny that you mentioned the garden because
[00:12:38.960] 这是我们个人待办事项清单的一部分。你提到花园真是太巧了，因为
[00:12:45.360]  I feel like you and james are always complaining about your garden area now
[00:12:45.360] 我觉得你和詹姆斯现在总是在抱怨你们的花园。
[00:12:51.440]  Dude, yeah
[00:12:51.440] 兄弟，是啊
[00:12:52.000]  And sometimes when we move stuff and like a wall gets scuffed or something like I'm always like, oh, fuck
[00:12:52.000] 有时候我们搬东西，比如墙面被刮花了什么的，我总是会想，哦，真倒霉。
[00:12:56.000]  We need to like go and paint that and there's just so many things that I have to think about
[00:12:56.000] 我们需要去把那幅画画起来，我得考虑的事情太多了。
[00:13:00.400]  It's now that we don't have an apartment manager or someone who does all the thinking for us
[00:13:00.400] 现在我们没有公寓经理，也没有人替我们考虑所有事情了。
[00:13:06.720]  That's true. You don't have somebody to like call or be like, this is your responsibility
[00:13:06.720] 没错。你没有可以打电话求助的人，也没有人会说：“这是你自己的责任。”
[00:13:13.280]  I'm like, oh fuck. This is our responsibility
[00:13:13.280] 我当时就想，糟了。这是我们的责任。
[00:13:17.760]  And honestly stuff like painting the walls or dealing with bits and pieces here and there inside or
[00:13:17.760] 老实说，像粉刷墙壁或者处理室内零零碎碎的事情，或者
[00:13:24.160]  Outside the home including the garden. I feel like it's somewhat intuitive
[00:13:24.160] 房屋外部，包括花园。我觉得这在某种程度上是直觉。
[00:13:27.520]  Like obviously when we bought this house, I was like, okay
[00:13:27.520] 很明显，当我们买下这栋房子的时候，我就想，好吧
[00:13:30.400]  Yeah, this like we're gonna have to do something about this garden
[00:13:30.400] 是啊，看来我们得对这个花园做点什么了。
[00:13:33.440]  But the crazy thing is I feel like there's all these miscellaneous items that I honestly never would have thought of
[00:13:33.440] 但最不可思议的是，我觉得还有很多我根本想不到的杂项。
[00:13:38.880]  For example, we were talking to one of our parents and their like back fence fell down
[00:13:38.880] 例如，我们正在和父母中的一位说话，这时他们家后院的围栏倒塌了。
[00:13:44.560]  So then they were telling us like, oh, yeah
[00:13:44.560] 所以他们就告诉我们，哦，是的
[00:13:46.640]  You have to go and like talk to that neighbor and see
[00:13:46.640] 你得去跟那个邻居谈谈，看看情况。
[00:13:49.280]  Which plot of land the fence stakes are in and then that's how you see who actually owns that fence
[00:13:49.280] 确定栅栏桩位于哪块地皮上，就能知道这块栅栏的真正所有者是谁了。
[00:13:56.000]  So sometimes it's like, oh half the fence like the left side of the fence is ours
[00:13:56.000] 所以有时候会这样，哦，围栏的一半，比如围栏的左边是我们的。
[00:14:00.640]  And then the right side of the fence is theirs
[00:14:00.640] 然后，围栏的右侧就归他们所有了。
[00:14:02.560]  So then if the left side falls we do it if the right side falls they do it or other times
[00:14:02.560] 所以，如果左侧倒了，我们就做；如果右侧倒了，他们就做；或者其他时候。
[00:14:07.200]  It's stake by stake. So you kind of alternate or some shit
[00:14:07.200] 这是一场一场地打赌。所以你得轮流来，或者诸如此类。
[00:14:10.640]  And I was sitting there listening to this and I was like, if you didn't tell me
[00:14:10.640] 我当时就坐在那儿听着，心想，如果你不告诉我……
[00:14:14.480]  I never would have even thought about our fence
[00:14:14.480] 我做梦也没想到我们的围栏会是个问题。
[00:14:16.640]  You know, because it's like in the back of our backyard
[00:14:16.640] 你知道，因为它就像在我们后院的后面。
[00:14:19.520]  Yeah, you're like, please don't fall down in the next like 50 years
[00:14:19.520] 是啊，你就会想，拜托，千万别在接下来的50年里倒塌啊。
[00:14:24.640]  I was like, we had a fence that sounds like a nightmare
[00:14:24.640] 我当时就想，我们家的围栏听起来简直像个噩梦。
[00:14:27.360]  Oh, that's true because you also have to talk to your neighbors about if say like the whole fence side is on your land
[00:14:27.360] 哦，没错，因为你还得跟邻居商量，比如说，如果整个围栏都建在你的地界上的话。
[00:14:33.920]  You still need to talk to them. Hey, is it okay if I do this design?
[00:14:33.920] 你还需要跟他们谈谈。嘿，我可以做这个设计吗？
[00:14:37.600]  Loki, right? It's like doesn't match the neighborhood. Like can I just do this?
[00:14:37.600] 洛基，对吧？感觉跟周围环境不太搭。我能这么做吗？
[00:14:41.600]  I imagine if say you're like, all right, fuck it. I'm just gonna get like some ugly ass like metal
[00:14:41.600] 我想，如果你说，好吧，去他妈的。我就弄点像金属一样丑的东西吧。
[00:14:47.360]  You know weave fence and then the neighbor's like, yo, what the fuck is that?
[00:14:47.360] 你知道，你编织了一道栅栏，然后邻居会说，哟，那他妈的是什么玩意儿？
[00:14:52.160]  Exactly
[00:14:52.160]  确切地
[00:14:53.120]  There's like, I don't know all these crazy rules that I feel like no one knows about except the people on next door
[00:14:53.120] 感觉好像除了隔壁邻居，没人知道这些奇奇怪怪的规矩。
[00:14:59.040]  Who somehow know like every law
[00:14:59.040] 谁不知何故像每条法律一样了如指掌
[00:15:01.440]  But it's like if your neighbor's tree is in your backyard, then legally you're allowed to snip it down
[00:15:01.440] 但这就像如果邻居的树长在你家后院，那么从法律上讲，你就可以把它砍掉一样。
[00:15:07.200]  But obviously you can't go and take out the roots or some shit because the tree is still theirs
[00:15:07.200] 但显然你不能把树根拔掉什么的，因为树的所有权仍然属于他们。
[00:15:11.760]  And you can legally take the fruit on your side, etc.
[00:15:11.760] 而且你可以合法地拿走你那边的水果等等。
[00:15:14.480]  Etc. Etc. So there's all these like little nuances where I'm just like
[00:15:14.480] 等等等等。所以有很多这样的小细节，我就像……
[00:15:17.840]  I can't believe there's a law for this or like I can't believe there's actual guidance for this
[00:15:17.840] 我简直不敢相信居然有相关的法律，或者说，我简直不敢相信居然有相关的指导方针。
[00:15:22.880]  Then when our neighbors in my parents house, there was like a time period where a lot of our neighbors were
[00:15:22.880] 后来，我父母家的邻居们，有一段时间，我们很多邻居都……
[00:15:30.240]  Trying to
[00:15:30.240] 尝试
[00:15:31.680]  build a second floor or like even a third floor and just like expand their house
[00:15:31.680] 加盖二层，甚至三层，就像扩建他们的房子一样。
[00:15:36.240]  And I think there's laws around if you build another floor or if you expand upwards
[00:15:36.240] 我认为，如果你加盖一层楼或者向上扩建，应该会有相关的法律规定。
[00:15:41.040]  Then there's laws about like, oh your window can't be facing a certain way where it's like you can see into somebody else's yard
[00:15:41.040] 还有一些法律规定，比如，你的窗户不能朝向某个方向，否则就可以看到别人家的院子。
[00:15:48.400]  So I remember some people would come around like some neighbors would like come around and be like
[00:15:48.400] 所以我记得有些人会过来，比如一些邻居会过来，然后说：
[00:15:52.880]  Hey, we're thinking of doing this. These are some of the things we're
[00:15:52.880] 嘿，我们正在考虑做这件事。以下是我们正在考虑的一些事项。
[00:15:57.120]  Wanting to upgrade and to build in our home
[00:15:57.120] 想升级和扩建我们的家
[00:16:00.560]  And I think you just need neighbors approvals and stuff like that
[00:16:00.560] 我觉得你只需要得到邻居的同意之类的。
[00:16:03.840]  And I think you as a neighbor and homeowner also have a lot of
[00:16:03.840] 而且我认为，作为邻居和房主，你也有很多……
[00:16:07.520]  I guess like rights to like what your neighbor can or cannot do
[00:16:07.520] 我想这就像有权知道你的邻居能做什么或不能做什么一样。
[00:16:11.600]  And if they want to expand or upgrade or like do whatever to their house too. So
[00:16:11.600] 如果他们想扩建、升级或者对房子做任何改动的话。
[00:16:15.760]  Yeah, I can see that being
[00:16:15.760] 是的，我能理解。
[00:16:18.640]  Very frustrating sometimes wait that makes so much sense because actually I can't see into my neighbor's backyard from my second floor
[00:16:18.640] 有时候真的很令人沮丧，等等，这解释得通，因为实际上我从二楼根本看不到邻居家的后院。
[00:16:27.280]  It's all like you've been trying
[00:16:27.280] 感觉你一直在努力。
[00:16:30.160]  Like I'm unable to do I think I think that's like one time
[00:16:30.160] 就像我做不到的那样，我觉得那就像只有一次。
[00:16:34.000]  They were being loud. So I like ran to the other side of the house. I was like, oh, maybe I can check out
[00:16:34.000] 他们太吵了。所以我跑到房子的另一边。我想，哦，也许我可以出去看看。
[00:16:38.400]  What's happening in the backyard? Like why is it so loud and I was like, I can't see shit, dude
[00:16:38.400] 后院发生了什么事？为什么这么吵？我什么都看不见，老兄。
[00:16:45.840]  House stuff is crazy, right dude. Yeah
[00:16:45.840] 家里的事儿真是太疯狂了，对吧兄弟？是啊。
[00:16:48.880]  And property taxes are crazy. Oh my god
[00:16:48.880] 房产税也太离谱了。我的天哪
[00:16:51.600]  Oh god
[00:16:51.600] 我的天啊
[00:16:52.640]  And I feel like it's harder to half-ass stuff once you own a home too because like in a rental, you know
[00:16:52.640] 而且我觉得一旦拥有了自己的房子，就很难再敷衍了事了，因为就像租房的时候一样，你知道的。
[00:16:58.480]  You're like, okay, whatever like I'll just haphazardly like pay over this part that I stuck a nail in
[00:16:58.480] 你会想，好吧，随便吧，我就随便付钱吧，反正我之前把钉子钉进去了。
[00:17:04.080]  But when it's like your own home, you're like, oh, I want to make sure it's gonna like last long
[00:17:04.080] 但当它像你自己的家一样时，你就会想，哦，我想确保它能长久使用。
[00:17:08.800]  I'm doing it properly. Yeah, and I feel like there's also funny shit that comes with like owning a house with someone
[00:17:08.800] 我做得挺正规的。是啊，而且我觉得跟别人合租房子也会带来一些挺搞笑的事情。
[00:17:15.440]  When I was growing up
[00:17:15.440] 在我成长的过程中
[00:17:16.480]  I feel like once every three months or something my parents would suddenly get inspiration at like 11 p.m
[00:17:16.480] 我觉得大概每三个月左右，我父母就会在晚上11点左右突然灵感迸发。
[00:17:22.960]  And then we would like rearrange certain rooms and it would be like a whole project and I would love
[00:17:22.960] 然后我们想重新布置一些房间，这会是一个完整的项目，我很乐意。
[00:17:27.360]  Wait, I remember that right like every time I came over your room would be you and a have a different room
[00:17:27.360] 等等，我记得没错，每次我去你家，你的房间都是你和我分开的。
[00:17:33.600]  And then be everything all the furniture in said room was different. That's so fun. It's like wait, what?
[00:17:33.600] 然后，房间里所有的家具都不一样了。这太有趣了。简直难以置信！
[00:17:39.600]  I'm like just like quarterly scramble
[00:17:39.600] 我感觉就像每季度都要忙得焦头烂额一样。
[00:17:41.760]  Yeah, you're like, all right, bet which which room is hers this time
[00:17:41.760] 是啊，你会想，好吧，打赌这次哪个房间是她的。
[00:17:46.000]  I know
[00:17:46.000]  我知道
[00:17:47.680]  But since that was so normal to me in my childhood and actually something that I would look forward to
[00:17:47.680] 但因为这在我童年时期是如此正常的事情，而且实际上是我很期待的事情。
[00:17:52.400]  I have that urge all the time here. I'm like, oh my god
[00:17:52.400] 我时时刻刻都有这种冲动。我就想，我的天哪
[00:17:55.120]  Like James we should swap our bedroom and our office for the summer because this room gets more sunlight and james is like
[00:17:55.120] 就像詹姆斯一样，我们应该在夏天把卧室和办公室互换一下，因为这个房间阳光更充足，而且詹姆斯就像……
[00:18:02.560]  No
[00:18:02.560]  不
[00:18:03.600]  I'm gonna throw out my back and I'm like, I guess but wouldn't it be so nice to be in the sunny room?
[00:18:03.600] 我的背快要扭伤了，我就想，好吧，但是待在阳光明媚的房间里该有多好啊？
[00:18:09.600]  Because he and his family come from the philosophy of like, oh, we set it up once
[00:18:09.600] 因为他和他的家人秉持着这样的理念：哦，我们只设立了一次。
[00:18:13.840]  It's like super nice and then done and done final
[00:18:13.840] 感觉超级棒，然后就完事儿了，彻底结束了。
[00:18:16.960]  But yeah, I'm always like, oh, let's paint this wall. Like let's do this. Let's move that and james is like, please
[00:18:16.960] 是啊，我总是会说，哦，咱们把这面墙刷一下吧。咱们做这个吧。咱们把那个挪一下，然后詹姆斯就会说，拜托
[00:18:21.600]  So I feel like even the homeowner philosophy or maybe just like the interior design philosophy is inherently different for us
[00:18:21.600] 所以我觉得，就连房主的理念，或者说室内设计的理念，对我们来说本质上都是不同的。
[00:18:29.360]  Oh my god, that's so funny
[00:18:29.360] 我的天哪，这太搞笑了
[00:18:30.960]  I can kind of feel that even without like being a homeowner
[00:18:30.960] 即使我不是房主，我也能感受到这一点。
[00:18:34.080]  But I feel like sometimes there was a period of time in our old studio
[00:18:34.080] 但我感觉，有时候我们在老工作室里会有一段时间……
[00:18:38.400]  Our old studio was so tiny. It was like our bed was up against the back of our couch
[00:18:38.400] 我们以前的单身公寓太小了，床几乎都贴着沙发靠背了。
[00:18:44.240]  That was up against the coffee table that was like up against the tv
[00:18:44.240] 那东西就靠着咖啡桌，咖啡桌又靠着电视。
[00:18:47.120]  So it was like tiny and then there's obviously no other way that we can rearrange furniture
[00:18:47.120] 所以空间非常小，而且显然我们没有其他办法重新布置家具。
[00:18:52.640]  But we were there for two years and by the end of it
[00:18:52.640] 但我们在那里待了两年，到最后……
[00:18:55.680]  We started sleeping with our head
[00:18:55.680] 我们开始头朝下睡觉。
[00:18:58.880]  Towards the foot of the bed
[00:18:58.880] 在床尾
[00:19:01.200]  You know, oh like you swapped the ends of your
[00:19:01.200] 你知道，就像你把两端互换了一样
[00:19:04.480]  No, we didn't swap anything. We just started like instead of sleeping with our head to like the headboard
[00:19:04.480] 不，我们没交换任何东西。我们只是开始习惯把头靠在床头板上睡觉。
[00:19:09.840]  Like a normal person. We just turned it around like we just slept with our head to the foot of the bed
[00:19:09.840] 就像正常人一样。我们只是把床翻了个身，就像我们平时睡觉时头朝床尾一样。
[00:19:15.360]  So you didn't even you didn't even rotate the bed
[00:19:15.360] 所以你甚至都没转动床。
[00:19:18.400]  Your feet were just at the headboard
[00:19:18.400] 你的脚刚好放在床头板上。
[00:19:20.400]  Yeah
[00:19:20.400]  是的
[00:19:21.680]  Because we were like there's no we can't physically move anything
[00:19:21.680] 因为我们当时就觉得，不行，我们根本搬不动任何东西。
[00:19:25.680]  But we're so desperate for that change and to like feel like something new and exciting is happening
[00:19:25.680] 但我们如此渴望改变，如此渴望感受到一些新鲜刺激的事情正在发生。
[00:19:32.560]  So we're like, okay. We're not gonna sleep the other way around
[00:19:32.560] 所以我们就想，好吧。我们不打算反过来睡。
[00:19:36.960]  Yeah, and then I think for a bit we were sleeping on the ground
[00:19:36.960] 是的，然后我想我们有一段时间睡在地上。
[00:19:41.520]  Just like we need to switch it up. The only thing you could rearrange is your bodies
[00:19:41.520] 就像我们需要改变一样。唯一可以重新安排的就是你们的身体。
[00:19:47.040]  Exactly
[00:19:47.040]  确切地
[00:19:48.960]  I will admit I do rearrange my room a lot too. Like every couple years. I'll rearrange it a bit
[00:19:48.960] 我承认我也经常重新布置房间，大概每隔几年就会重新布置一下。
[00:19:55.440]  It's just it's fun
[00:19:55.440] 就是好玩而已。
[00:19:56.960]  Okay, but what I've learned is the ultimate move is to put wheels on your furniture
[00:19:56.960] 好吧，但我学到的终极秘诀是给家具装上轮子。
[00:20:01.200]  That like any furniture that can have wheels you should put wheels on them
[00:20:01.200] 就像任何可以装轮子的家具一样，你应该给它们装上轮子。
[00:20:05.040]  So my desk you can put heavy-duty wheels on them
[00:20:05.040] 所以我的桌子可以装上重型轮子。
[00:20:08.320]  So I did and so it's a lot easier to rearrange my room now. Wait, that's genius. Yeah
[00:20:08.320] 所以我照做了，现在重新布置房间容易多了。等等，这真是个绝妙的主意。是啊。
[00:20:13.280]  I'm about to move. So oh, yeah, I'm actually gonna start
[00:20:13.280] 我马上要搬家了。所以，哦，是的，我真的要开始了
[00:20:16.960]  I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do that
[00:20:16.960] 我打算这么做。我打算这么做。
[00:20:19.280]  I think a lot of like standing desks nowadays have like the option to add wheels. So pretty nice
[00:20:19.280] 我觉得现在很多站立式办公桌都可以选择加装轮子。真不错。
[00:20:25.600]  So I have something that's not necessarily home or apartment related
[00:20:25.600] 所以，我有些东西可能跟房子或公寓没什么关系。
[00:20:30.320]  But I do want to ask you guys this because I feel like there's
[00:20:30.320] 但我还是想问问你们这个问题，因为我觉得……
[00:20:33.520]  In my mind two archetypes of people every year with your
[00:20:33.520] 在我看来，每年都会出现两种典型的人，你
[00:20:37.840]  health insurance vision insurance
[00:20:37.840] 健康保险 视力保险
[00:20:39.840]  dental insurance
[00:20:39.840] 牙科保险
[00:20:40.720]  I feel like you get like a reset of like, okay
[00:20:40.720] 我觉得就像是重新开始一样，好吧
[00:20:42.960]  This year you can go get your cleaning done twice and get your vision checked, etc
[00:20:42.960] 今年你可以去做两次清洁，还可以检查视力等等。
[00:20:46.800]  Etc. Are you guys more the type to go and do all your appointments in January?
[00:20:46.800] 等等。你们是不是更倾向于把所有预约都安排在一月份？
[00:20:52.240]  Aka like the moment you can do it or are you the type to go in December aka like the last possible moment you can use up your benefits
[00:20:52.240] 也就是说，你是打算在你能做的第一时间就去做，还是你会等到十二月才去做，也就是等到你能用完福利的最后期限？
[00:21:00.400]  Oh, I think this depends
[00:21:00.400] 哦，我觉得这要看情况。
[00:21:02.880]  Because some of these benefits once you get them rolling like you don't have to worry as much. So for example like
[00:21:02.880] 因为一旦你开始使用这些方法，其中一些好处就会显现出来，比如你就不必那么担心了。例如，比如
[00:21:09.920]  Dentist I just make my next appointment every time that I go
[00:21:09.920] 我每次去看牙医都会预约下一次。
[00:21:13.920]  But when I finally got off my parents insurance, I had to basically like re-enroll myself in a lot of these things, right?
[00:21:13.920] 但是当我最终脱离父母的保险后，我基本上不得不重新参加很多这些东西，对吧？
[00:21:20.880]  So I definitely put it off. I think that year I didn't do my dentist stuff till like the end of the year
[00:21:20.880] 所以我肯定拖延了。我记得那一年我直到年底才去看牙医。
[00:21:29.040]  And then I was like, okay. Well at least now that it's done
[00:21:29.040] 然后我就想，好吧。至少现在事情已经结束了。
[00:21:31.920]  They'll just make me make the next appointment every time
[00:21:31.920] 他们每次都让我自己预约下一次。
[00:21:35.040]  But my optometry appointment was literally the last possible day of December
[00:21:35.040] 但我预约的验光检查时间竟然是十二月的最后一天！
[00:21:40.560]  Like maybe mid-december before holidays
[00:21:40.560] 比如12月中旬，假期之前。
[00:21:43.680]  And I think it's vision like they make you wait the full 12 months before you can make your next appointment
[00:21:43.680] 我觉得他们的愿景是，他们让你等整整12个月才能预约下一次就诊。
[00:21:50.720]  So now I'm just stuck with a december like end of year
[00:21:50.720] 所以现在我只能等到十二月才能结束这一年了。
[00:21:54.640]  time for my like eye doctor appointment and I'm like wait, this is lucky a terrible time
[00:21:54.640] 到了我预约眼科医生的时间，我心想，等等，这真是个糟糕的时机。
[00:21:59.520]  Like what if I'm traveling then I would just miss the whole year
[00:21:59.520] 如果我去旅行怎么办？那我岂不是会错过整整一年？
[00:22:03.120]  Right and I feel like always in december the like booking and the lines of any sort of appointment
[00:22:03.120] 对，我觉得每年十二月预约都特别难，各种预约都要排队。
[00:22:09.120]  Related to insurance is just so bad. I'll have to double check like maybe I can do it earlier
[00:22:09.120] 保险方面的事情真是太糟糕了。我得再确认一下，看看能不能早点办。
[00:22:15.120]  But I know on my old insurance provision. I had to wait like the full 12 months
[00:22:15.120] 但我知道根据我之前的保险条款，我必须等整整12个月。
[00:22:20.480]  That does sound familiar to me too
[00:22:20.480] 听起来也很熟悉。
[00:22:23.920]  But it's actually tragic to be stuck with that kind of timeline
[00:22:23.920] 但实际上，被困在这种时间线里是一件很悲哀的事。
[00:22:28.240]  How about you Jessica? Are you leaning more toward January appointments or december appointments?
[00:22:28.240] 杰西卡，你呢？你更倾向于一月份的预约还是十二月份的预约？
[00:22:33.760]  I think I'm pretty similar to crystal where I kind of have a rhythm now
[00:22:33.760] 我觉得我和Crystal挺像的，我现在也挺有节奏的。
[00:22:39.040]  Like once you kind of said it you just stick with your rhythm, but I think mine's a little bit more ideal
[00:22:39.040] 就像你一旦说出口，就坚持自己的节奏，但我认为我的节奏更理想一些。
[00:22:46.080]  Not during all the jealous
[00:22:46.080] 并非在所有嫉妒的时候
[00:22:49.040]  Okay with like dental stuff, I feel like they're a little less strict
[00:22:49.040] 像牙科方面，我觉得他们在这方面稍微宽松一些。
[00:22:54.400]  There has to be six months between your appointments
[00:22:54.400] 两次预约之间必须间隔六个月。
[00:22:57.120]  But then if you like stretch it out a bit longer
[00:22:57.120] 但如果你喜欢，可以把它拉长一点
[00:23:00.400]  Like if you do it in like january, then I feel like you can switch up your rhythm very easily
[00:23:00.400] 比如如果你在一月份做这件事，我觉得你可以很轻松地改变你的节奏。
[00:23:05.120]  So my dental appointments right now are
[00:23:05.120] 所以我目前的牙科预约是：
[00:23:08.720]  Typically, I think I had one in like february and then the next one is in like july or august or whatever it is
[00:23:08.720] 通常情况下，我记得一例大概在二月份，下一例大概在七月或八月，或者其他什么月份。
[00:23:15.280]  My optometrist because now for the last couple of years
[00:23:15.280] 我的验光师，因为在过去的几年里
[00:23:18.480]  I've been wearing contacts like monthly contacts and so I need that
[00:23:18.480] 我一直戴的是月抛型隐形眼镜，所以我需要那个
[00:23:24.080]  Coming up like I need to order my new year or else
[00:23:24.080] 感觉我得赶紧安排好新年计划，不然……
[00:23:26.560]  I just won't have contacts because they're monthly
[00:23:26.560] 我只是不想办隐形眼镜，因为它们是月付的。
[00:23:28.880]  So it's like very strict like 12 months and I it's like done like I don't have any more
[00:23:28.880] 所以规定非常严格，比如12个月，然后就结束了，我没有其他安排了。
[00:23:33.520]  So with that, I'm usually pretty on top of it. That's around like
[00:23:33.520] 所以，在这方面，我通常都能掌控得很好。大概就是这样。
[00:23:37.840]  March april ish. That's a way better time than mine
[00:23:37.840] 三四月份左右。那比我那边的时间好多了。
[00:23:42.240]  I agree. I highly recommend
[00:23:42.240] 我同意。我强烈推荐。
[00:23:45.360]  Wait, that's crazy monthly contacts. Okay. Also a funny story about contacts is
[00:23:45.360] 等等，这每月联系费也太疯狂了吧。好吧。还有一个关于联系费的趣事……
[00:23:51.440]  I tried contacts for the first time a year ago now and I ordered with them
[00:23:51.440] 我大约一年前第一次尝试佩戴隐形眼镜，当时是从他们那里订购的。
[00:23:57.440]  I doctor. I was like, okay, I'll get a couple boxes
[00:23:57.440] 我是医生。我就想，好吧，我买几盒吧。
[00:23:59.600]  But the thing is I don't wear glasses and or contacts every day
[00:23:59.600] 但问题是，我并非每天都戴眼镜或隐形眼镜。
[00:24:03.920]  So I bought like 90 days worth of contacts and I did not finish them in a year
[00:24:03.920] 所以我买了够用90天的隐形眼镜，结果一年都没用完。
[00:24:09.120]  I didn't even finish a box
[00:24:09.120] 我连一盒都没吃完。
[00:24:12.320]  Wait, did you buy dailies? Yeah, dailies. Okay. So the first time I had contacts that year
[00:24:12.320] 等等，你买的是日抛型隐形眼镜？对，日抛型。好的。那一年我第一次戴隐形眼镜。
[00:24:18.720]  I bought six months worth of dailies. That was when I was on dailies and I think it took me
[00:24:18.720] 我买了六个月的每日剂量。那时候我还在用每日剂量，我觉得花了……
[00:24:25.280]  A little over a year to like finish using all of them
[00:24:25.280] 大概一年多一点的时间就把它们全部用完了。
[00:24:28.800]  But they they don't expire for like five or six years or something like that. They last a really long time
[00:24:28.800] 但它们的保质期很长，比如五六年左右。它们真的能保存很久。
[00:24:33.520]  But then after I moved to New York, I started
[00:24:33.520] 但后来我搬到纽约后，就开始了。
[00:24:37.360]  Wearing contacts a lot more frequently
[00:24:37.360] 更频繁地佩戴隐形眼镜
[00:24:40.240]  And also that time it was like COVID and I was like wearing my mask on the train
[00:24:40.240] 而且那时候正值新冠疫情时期，我在火车上也一直戴着口罩。
[00:24:44.480]  Just wearing glasses when you're out and about in the city is just the worst
[00:24:44.480] 在城市里出门戴眼镜简直糟透了。
[00:24:48.320]  So I started wearing contacts very frequently and that's when I switched to the monthly
[00:24:48.320] 所以我开始频繁佩戴隐形眼镜，也就是从那时起我换成了月抛型隐形眼镜。
[00:24:52.000]  So now I'm on the schedule this time when I went to my eye doctor. I was like, oh
[00:24:52.000] 所以这次我去眼科医生那里的时候，已经把预约安排好了。我当时就想，哦
[00:24:56.640]  I'll just get one box of contacts. They're like, are you sure? That's only 45 days
[00:24:56.640] 我只想买一盒隐形眼镜。他们问我，你确定吗？那才45天而已。
[00:25:00.400]  There's like a whole year ahead of you. I was like, no, trust me. Like that's fine
[00:25:00.400] 你还有整整一年的时间呢。我当时就想，别担心，相信我，没事的。
[00:25:03.760]  I hear like my vision is decently bad. So then I definitely like rely heavily on my contacts and I hate wearing glasses
[00:25:03.760] 我听说我的视力不太好。所以我非常依赖隐形眼镜，而且我讨厌戴眼镜。
[00:25:13.520]  outside
[00:25:13.520]  外部
[00:25:14.400]  So if I don't have contacts, I'm like fucked
[00:25:14.400] 所以如果我没有联系人，我就完蛋了。
[00:25:17.200]  But the crazy part is I think this happened more so after James and I moved here
[00:25:17.200] 但最不可思议的是，我觉得这种情况在我和詹姆斯搬到这里之后发生得更多了。
[00:25:23.760]  We just haven't found doctors and like dentists and like, you know
[00:25:23.760] 我们还没找到医生，还有牙医之类的，你知道的。
[00:25:27.840]  Vision offices that we like really love because I'm kind of like, oh
[00:25:27.840] 我们真的很喜欢Vision的办公室，因为我会觉得，哦
[00:25:30.720]  I'm trying to find someone who's like a lifelong doctor, right?
[00:25:30.720] 我想找的是一个终身从事医疗工作的人，对吧？
[00:25:33.920]  So then we're kind of shopping around which I think one makes it easy to kind of miss like a normal cadence of appointments
[00:25:33.920] 所以我们现在就像是在四处比价，我觉得这样很容易错过正常的预约节奏。
[00:25:41.040]  To because I'm missing the cadence. I feel like I'm always like, oh my god, my prescription expired
[00:25:41.040] 因为我感觉自己失去了节奏。我总觉得，天哪，我的处方过期了。
[00:25:46.240]  I have like two weeks of contacts left. I need to go and like get something
[00:25:46.240] 我的隐形眼镜还剩两周左右。我得去买点东西了。
[00:25:50.080]  This happened to me maybe like a month ago
[00:25:50.080] 这事大概一个月前发生在我身上了。
[00:25:52.560]  And I was like freaking out. I was like, I don't have any more contacts left
[00:25:52.560] 我当时都快崩溃了。我想，我一个隐形眼镜都没了。
[00:25:55.600]  I need a book of vision exam ASAP but the next time that I can like go in for it is in two weeks, etc
[00:25:55.600] 我急需做视力检查，但下次能做检查的时间是两周后，等等。
[00:26:02.080]  So then I went on my website that I used to buy contact lenses
[00:26:02.080] 于是，我打开了我以前用来购买隐形眼镜的网站。
[00:26:07.360]  I was like, I wonder if this will go through so I ordered it off my old prescription and then it actually went through
[00:26:07.360] 我当时想，不知道能不能成功，就用我之前的处方下了单，结果居然成功了。
[00:26:12.640]  Even though it was expired. Isn't that crazy? I would never recommend this obviously my eye doctor just hands me a box in the office
[00:26:12.640] 虽然已经过期了。是不是很离谱？我当然不会推荐这种做法，我的眼科医生直接就在诊室里给了我一盒。
[00:26:20.080]  They don't always have it ready. Oh, that's true. Yeah, I think they have to like order it
[00:26:20.080] 他们不总是能现成的。哦，确实如此。是啊，我觉得他们得订货。
[00:26:25.120]  They were like, oh, okay. Your prescription is like pretty basic. So we have some boxes here
[00:26:25.120] 他们说，哦，好的。你的处方很简单。所以我们这里有一些药盒。
[00:26:30.400]  And they just give it to me. I mean, I guess if you're just getting one box
[00:26:30.400] 他们就直接给我了。我的意思是，如果你只想要一盒的话，那大概就是这样。
[00:26:34.400]  You have that too. That too. They're like, oh, you'll need one box like, okay
[00:26:34.400] 你也有那个。也有。他们会说，哦，你需要一个盒子，好的。
[00:26:38.960]  Open store. They're like, we have 45
[00:26:38.960] 开门营业。他们说，我们有45
[00:26:42.480]  contact lenses here
[00:26:42.480] 这里提供隐形眼镜
[00:26:44.880]  But that's such a good point. I feel like finding a new
[00:26:44.880] 但你说的很有道理。我觉得应该找个新的
[00:26:48.720]  doctor for anything
[00:26:48.720] 去看医生，什么事都可以。
[00:26:50.800]  Is super annoying. I guess I'm always like, what do I look for?
[00:26:50.800] 真是太烦人了。我总是想，我到底该找什么呢？
[00:26:55.840]  Like my dentist is a family friend. So I just stick to that
[00:26:55.840] 我的牙医是我的家人朋友，所以我一直都去那里看牙。
[00:26:59.440]  And then for eye doctor though, I just stuck with what my
[00:26:59.440] 至于眼科医生，我还是坚持选择我之前看过的医生。
[00:27:04.000]  Parents had originally found me but now I'm kind of like, oh shoot. It's a little far from home
[00:27:04.000] 父母最初找到了我，但现在我有点懵，心想：糟了，离家有点远。
[00:27:08.000]  Like maybe I should find a new one
[00:27:08.000] 或许我应该找个新的
[00:27:09.680]  But like what do I even look for? Like how do I know if they're good?
[00:27:09.680] 但我到底该看什么呢？我怎么知道它们好不好呢？
[00:27:12.800]  You know in my journey of trying to find the one
[00:27:12.800] 你知道，在我寻找真爱的旅程中
[00:27:16.960]  Us in like the one dentist that I know and trust etc etc for all of my doctor needs
[00:27:16.960] 我认识并信任的牙医就是我所有就医需求的唯一选择。
[00:27:22.640]  I always go back to what Jessica was saying earlier about like going to get your car stuff done
[00:27:22.640] 我总是想起杰西卡之前说的，比如去把车子的事情处理好。
[00:27:27.520]  I'm always like, are you scamming me?
[00:27:27.520] 我总是想，你是不是在骗我？
[00:27:30.000]  I know they're not for the most part. Everyone is very like honest and whatnot
[00:27:30.000] 我知道他们大多数都不是。每个人都很诚实之类的。
[00:27:34.000]  but I think certain
[00:27:34.000] 但我认为肯定
[00:27:35.760]  People push you more to like get all this other stuff done
[00:27:35.760] 人们更倾向于催促你完成其他所有事情。
[00:27:38.800]  Which is like incremental costs versus other people are more
[00:27:38.800] 这就像增量成本与其他人相比更高一样。
[00:27:41.840]  Direct and like straightforward and like are better at recommending stuff that you might want and need a little bit more
[00:27:41.840] 直截了当、直截了当的，更擅长推荐你可能想要或需要的东西。
[00:27:48.080]  So then doing that evaluation anytime I go to any sort of appointment just makes it so much more tiring than like
[00:27:48.080] 所以，每次我去赴约都要做那种评估，这让事情变得比平时累得多。
[00:27:53.840]  Popping it in out and just being okay with it. I'm always like, I feel like I could find better
[00:27:53.840] 随便拿一下就行了，也就那样吧。我总是觉得，我还能找到更好的。
[00:27:58.080]  And it's like the toxic cycle of where is the better person? But oh my god. Yeah
[00:27:58.080] 这就像一个恶性循环，总想着“更好的人在哪里？”但我的天哪。是啊。
[00:28:03.360]  I mean like even with finding a primary physician
[00:28:03.360] 我的意思是，即使是找个家庭医生这样的事情。
[00:28:07.360]  I think in new york, I was so daunted by that task that I just was like fuck it
[00:28:07.360] 我觉得在纽约的时候，我被那项任务吓到了，就直接放弃了。
[00:28:12.560]  I'm just gonna walk into whichever like I don't have a set person who knows my history. I just like go use whoever
[00:28:12.560] 我打算随便找个人就行，因为我没有固定的人了解我的病史。我就随便找个人就行了。
[00:28:19.680]  But I was like, okay, maybe long term. This is not that great
[00:28:19.680] 但我当时想，好吧，也许从长远来看是这样。但这也没那么好。
[00:28:23.040]  Wait in new york, did you ever use zock dog?
[00:28:23.040] 等一下，你在纽约的时候用过Zock Dog吗？
[00:28:26.240]  No, okay to be honest what I ended up doing was I think I met my deductible through other things
[00:28:26.240] 不，好吧，老实说，我最后的做法是，我觉得我通过其他方式达到了我的自付额要求。
[00:28:32.640]  Like physical therapy or like chiropractor stuff because I met my deductible. I was like, okay
[00:28:32.640] 比如物理治疗或者脊椎按摩之类的，因为我已经达到了自付额上限。我就想，好吧。
[00:28:39.360]  Who cares? I'll just go into urgent care. It's fully covered now anyway
[00:28:39.360] 谁在乎？我直接去急诊就行了。反正现在全额报销了。
[00:28:46.880]  Oh my god, that's hilarious
[00:28:46.880] 我的天哪，太搞笑了！
[00:28:49.840]  Well urgent care can't do like physicals and stuff right? Yeah, I never did a physical
[00:28:49.840] 急诊中心不能做体检之类的，对吧？是啊，我从来没做过体检。
[00:28:54.880]  Just like if you needed stuff. Yeah, I was like, oh, I'm sick. I'll just go to urgent care
[00:28:54.880] 就像你需要什么东西一样。是啊，我就想，哦，我生病了。我去急诊看看吧。
[00:28:58.800]  Oh my god, I went to urgent care a couple weeks
[00:28:58.800] 我的天哪，我几周前去了趟急诊。
[00:29:02.560]  Like maybe a month ago because I was having this leg pain
[00:29:02.560] 大概一个月前，因为我腿疼。
[00:29:05.920]  That ended up being like a nerve issue, but I went and I just got the bill like yesterday
[00:29:05.920] 最后发现是神经方面的问题，但我去了，昨天刚收到账单。
[00:29:11.920]  It's like $150. I was like, oh it's like not the worst
[00:29:11.920] 大概150美元。我当时想，哦，这还不算太糟。
[00:29:16.080]  It's not the worst but still feels like considering like what I did not get out of that appointment
[00:29:16.080] 虽然不是最糟糕的情况，但还是感觉有点后悔这次预约没能得到什么。
[00:29:21.840]  It feels bad
[00:29:21.840] 感觉很糟糕
[00:29:23.680]  And I definitely did not mean my deductible
[00:29:23.680] 我绝对不是指我的自付额。
[00:29:25.680]  It was very satisfying when I checked my deductible. I was like, oh, I met it. I go into urgent care
[00:29:25.680] 当我查看我的自付额时，我感到非常满意。我心想，哦，我已经达到自付额了。我去急诊中心就诊。
[00:29:30.800]  I get the bill later fully covered
[00:29:30.800] 我之后收到的账单全部都已报销。
[00:29:34.560]  You like walk in like you own the place
[00:29:34.560] 你走进去就像你是老板一样。
[00:29:38.000]  Because otherwise it's like wow, I would have paid a couple hundred to get this cough checked out, right?
[00:29:38.000] 不然的话，就好像我花了几百块钱去检查一下咳嗽，对吧？
[00:29:44.560]  True. So I got by that way, but now that I'm in the bay
[00:29:44.560] 没错。所以我就那样熬过来了，但现在我身处海湾。
[00:29:48.480]  I'm like, okay, like I asked my parents what doctors they used
[00:29:48.480] 我当时就想，好吧，我就问我爸妈他们以前都找哪些医生看病。
[00:29:52.400]  Which hospital that they are patients at so then I just like joined that network and I was like, okay
[00:29:52.400] 他们是哪家医院的病人？然后我就加入了那个网络，心想，好吧。
[00:29:57.840]  I guess I'll trust whatever my parents are using
[00:29:57.840] 我想我还是会相信我父母用的那些东西。
[00:30:00.480]  It is like truly hard to find the right doctor though because I feel like on Yelp or Jessica
[00:30:00.480] 真的很难找到合适的医生，因为我觉得在Yelp或Jessica上找医生不太合适。
[00:30:05.520]  You mentioned Zock doc, which I think is something similar to that, right? Like they have reviews and stuff
[00:30:05.520] 你提到了Zock doc，我觉得它跟那个差不多，对吧？他们也有评论之类的东西。
[00:30:10.160]  Yeah, it's like so there's reviews on Zock doc
[00:30:10.160] 是的，就像这样，Zock doc 上有评论。
[00:30:13.920]  I never actually read any of the reviews. I just like look at the rating and if it's really low then I
[00:30:13.920] 我从来不看评论。我只看评分，如果评分很低，那我就不看了。
[00:30:19.920]  don't even look at it
[00:30:19.920] 别看它一眼。
[00:30:22.320]  But Zock doc is I think it might only be in New York
[00:30:22.320] 但我认为佐克医生可能只在纽约有诊治。
[00:30:25.920]  I think I tried using it once in California and it there was like nothing came up
[00:30:25.920] 我想我之前在加州用过一次，结果好像什么都没发生。
[00:30:30.720]  It's probably regional but it's basically like an appointment scheduler for all sorts of health related things
[00:30:30.720] 这可能是区域性的，但它基本上就像一个预约系统，可以安排各种与健康相关的事务。
[00:30:37.920]  So I book my dentist my automatrists my annual physical and you can even do if you want to go get like a derm appointment
[00:30:37.920] 所以我预约了牙医、自动注射器、年度体检，你甚至可以预约皮肤科医生之类的。
[00:30:44.720]  Or like obgi an appointment like all health related things
[00:30:44.720] 或者像预约一样，就像所有与健康相关的事情一样。
[00:30:48.880]  You can get through Zock doc even like p2 and so I used Zock doc initially to like find people
[00:30:48.880] 你甚至可以通过 Zock Doc 找到像 P2 这样的人，所以我一开始就用 Zock Doc 来找人。
[00:30:56.160]  Some of them have worked out like I really like my dentist
[00:30:56.160] 有些事情进展得很顺利，比如我真的很喜欢我的牙医。
[00:30:58.560]  So I always I keep going to her my automatrists. I like shopped around a little bit
[00:30:58.560] 所以我总是去她那里买我的自动机械师作品。我也稍微逛了逛其他店铺。
[00:31:03.360]  But my primary I've gone to like a couple times now too. So
[00:31:03.360] 但我的主治医生我也去过好几次了。
[00:31:07.840]  Yeah, I feel like it's a good starting out place or if it's just like for example
[00:31:07.840] 是的，我觉得这里是个不错的起点，或者比如说……
[00:31:12.560]  I don't go to the dermatologist very often
[00:31:12.560] 我不太常去看皮肤科医生。
[00:31:16.160]  But if I wanted to then I would go out there and look at it. Yeah, this has not been an ad for
[00:31:16.160] 但如果我想的话，我就会出去看看。是的，这并不是在做广告。
[00:31:22.800]  I mean that sounds really useful
[00:31:22.800] 我的意思是，这听起来真的很有用。
[00:31:24.560]  I have like a built-in tool kind of similar to that in my like health
[00:31:24.560] 我的设备上也有一个类似这样的内置工具，比如健康类应用。
[00:31:29.440]  Well, I don't even know what this is like some sort of health portal
[00:31:29.440] 嗯，我甚至不知道这是什么，有点像健康门户网站。
[00:31:33.040]  But the thing is there's no reviews
[00:31:33.040] 但问题是，没有任何评论。
[00:31:35.040]  It's just like a blank and I'm like this isn't helping me at all
[00:31:35.040] 就像一片空白，我觉得这对我一点帮助都没有。
[00:31:38.160]  The reviews get kind of
[00:31:38.160] 评论有点……
[00:31:39.840]  So I feel like it's always five stars like everyone on yelp who's any sort of doctor or dentist
[00:31:39.840] 所以我觉得我的评价总是五星，就像Yelp上所有给五星好评的医生或牙医一样。
[00:31:46.720]  It's all five stars and then you read the reviews and it's like, oh my god
[00:31:46.720] 一开始全是五星好评，然后你看了评论，就觉得，我的天哪
[00:31:50.320]  I've been going to this person for the last like 40 years. I love this guy and then there's like a one-star review
[00:31:50.320] 我找这个人看病已经有40年了。我非常喜欢他，结果却看到有人给了他一星评价。
[00:31:56.480]  That's like I'm literally blind because of this person like blah blah and I'm like, okay, which one is it?
[00:31:56.480] 感觉就像我因为这个人而完全失明了一样，诸如此类，然后我就想，好吧，到底哪个才是真的？
[00:32:03.520]  Which one do I try that's true. I've definitely seen that too. It's like there's no in between
[00:32:03.520] 到底该试哪个呢？确实如此。我也遇到过这种情况。好像没有中间选项。
[00:32:07.840]  It's just like this is the best or this is literally the worst. Yeah
[00:32:07.840] 感觉要么这是最好的，要么这是最差的。是啊。
[00:32:12.880]  I mean, is there any criteria though that you even look for specifically?
[00:32:12.880] 我的意思是，你有没有特别关注哪些标准呢？
[00:32:18.640]  Because I'm thinking about it and I I like don't even have criteria
[00:32:18.640] 因为我一直在思考这个问题，而且我喜欢……甚至都没有什么标准。
[00:32:22.000]  I'm like, I hope they're nice and they can do their job
[00:32:22.000] 我心想，希望他们人好，也能做好自己的工作。
[00:32:24.720]  But then I realize that my parents actually have some criteria
[00:32:24.720] 但后来我意识到，我的父母其实有一些标准。
[00:32:27.680]  Like to them they would prefer if this person can speak some chinese so, you know, they can like communicate better
[00:32:27.680] 他们希望这个人能说一些中文，这样他们就能更好地沟通。
[00:32:34.000]  I don't know sometimes like when they choose their primary physician. They look at their like
[00:32:34.000] 我不知道有时候他们会怎么想，比如当他们选择自己的主治医生时。他们会考虑自己喜欢的医生。
[00:32:38.480]  School history. Yeah credentials and I'm like, dude, doesn't really matter like they're all doctors anyway
[00:32:38.480] 学历背景。是啊，资历什么的，我就想，哥们儿，这根本不重要，反正他们都是医生。
[00:32:44.080]  Dude, I kind of look at that sometimes the school that they came out of
[00:32:44.080] 兄弟，我有时候会看看他们毕业的那所学校。
[00:32:48.000]  I don't know why but it's because there's nothing else to go off of so I was like, I guess I might as well look at this
[00:32:48.000] 我也不知道为什么，可能是因为没有其他线索了，所以我就想，不如看看这个吧。
[00:32:53.600]  They should make like hinge profiles. Oh my god are dentists wait. You're so right
[00:32:53.600] 他们应该做成铰链状的轮廓。我的天哪，牙医们等等。你说得太对了。
[00:32:58.320]  Like they need to have some sort of get to know me
[00:32:58.320] 好像他们需要某种形式的相互了解。
[00:33:01.520]  You're right. Yeah, true like I'm outgoing and talkative and you're like, okay. No, I prefer silence in my mind
[00:33:01.520] 你说得对。是啊，确实，我性格外向，爱说话，你可能会觉得，好吧。不，我更喜欢内心的平静。
[00:33:08.400]  What is my bedside manner?
[00:33:08.400] 我的医患沟通技巧如何？
[00:33:12.640]  My favorite type of patient is
[00:33:12.640] 我最喜欢的病人类型是
[00:33:16.160]  Like you should match with me if oh my god
[00:33:16.160] 就像你应该和我配对一样，哦我的天哪
[00:33:20.800]  I don't know if I I think the only criteria I have is I think I try to see
[00:33:20.800] 我不知道我是否……我想我唯一的标准就是……我想看看
[00:33:26.160]  Women doctors and like dentists or whoever as much as possible
[00:33:26.160] 尽可能多地选择女医生，比如牙医或其他相关人员。
[00:33:31.040]  Usually I'm talk talk. I'll like filter out guys
[00:33:31.040] 我平时喜欢聊天。我会筛选掉男生。
[00:33:34.400]  Because they allow you to do that. So I'm like, all right might as well
[00:33:34.400] 因为他们允许你这么做。所以我就想，好吧，那就这么做吧。
[00:33:38.400]  Yeah
[00:33:38.400]  是的
[00:33:39.440]  I feel like that's really the only criteria I have. Oh, I guess for my primary
[00:33:39.440] 我觉得这真的是我唯一的标准了。哦，我想对于我的主修专业来说……
[00:33:45.360]  Don't come for me, but I don't usually go for
[00:33:45.360] 别来找我麻烦，但我通常也不会这么做。
[00:33:49.120]  RNs like
[00:33:49.120] 注册护士
[00:33:50.960]  nurses or
[00:33:50.960] 护士或
[00:33:52.960]  Um, like nps. Yeah, I'm thinking about nps because they're the ones who can actually prescribe
[00:33:52.960] 嗯，就像护士长（NPs）那样。对，我想到护士长是因为只有他们才能开处方。
[00:33:58.960]  Do you skip deos? Depends on the rating
[00:33:58.960] 你会不用除臭剂吗？这取决于评分。
[00:34:02.480]  Wait, what are deos again?
[00:34:02.480] 等等，除臭剂（deos）是什么来着？
[00:34:04.480]  They are doctors, but they come from a different program than mds
[00:34:04.480] 他们是医生，但他们的医学博士课程与医学博士课程不同。
[00:34:09.200]  Like they don't have an md degree. They have like a do degree and I think they've learned slightly
[00:34:09.200] 他们好像没有医学博士学位，只有骨科医学学位，而且我觉得他们学到的东西不多。
[00:34:14.160]  slightly different things
[00:34:14.160] 略有不同的事物
[00:34:15.520]  But they still go through like residency and like like all the training and stuff like that
[00:34:15.520] 但他们仍然要经历住院医师培训以及各种类似的培训等等。
[00:34:19.600]  And yeah, they still have their same specialties. I believe but they're just like not an md
[00:34:19.600] 是的，他们仍然有各自的专长。我相信，但他们不是医学博士。
[00:34:24.480]  Yeah, I've had deodorant and I really like them
[00:34:24.480] 是的，我用过除臭剂，我很喜欢。
[00:34:27.760]  So I feel like I'm not
[00:34:27.760] 所以我觉得自己不像个……
[00:34:29.360]  persistent against deos
[00:34:29.360] 持续对抗除草剂
[00:34:33.600]  So a boils down to the rating
[00:34:33.600] 所以归根结底就是评分。
[00:34:36.560]  And the bedside manner. Yeah
[00:34:36.560] 还有医护人员的态度。是的。
[00:34:38.880]  Yeah, they really should have some sort of like bedside manner description dude. They should that would be so helpful
[00:34:38.880] 是啊，他们真应该加个类似“床边服务态度”之类的描述。他们应该这么做，那会很有帮助的。
[00:34:45.600]  And I feel like the vibe of the like office matters too when you go to the dentist
[00:34:45.600] 我觉得去看牙医时，诊所的氛围也很重要。
[00:34:49.680]  You're like also seeing the hygienist and whatever
[00:34:49.680] 你好像还要去看牙科保健师什么的
[00:34:52.480]  But it is kind of funny because James and I just started going to this new dental office
[00:34:52.480] 但这件事还挺巧的，因为我和詹姆斯最近刚开始去这家新的牙科诊所。
[00:34:57.440]  And they're like nice and whatnot and it was just like a normal experience
[00:34:57.440] 他们人挺好的，一切都像平常一样。
[00:35:01.600]  But then I was on instagram the other day and then their instagram account popped up and they post a lot on instagram
[00:35:01.600] 但前几天我在Instagram上浏览时，他们的账号突然出现了，他们在Instagram上发了很多内容。
[00:35:07.760]  And I was like, I don't know if this is like a pro or a con for me personally. I'm like
[00:35:07.760] 我当时就想，我不知道这对我个人来说是好事还是坏事。
[00:35:12.880]  Why you guys have social media?
[00:35:12.880] 你们为什么使用社交媒体？
[00:35:14.960]  Oh, yeah
[00:35:14.960] 哦，是的
[00:35:18.720]  Yeah, I wouldn't know how to react either
[00:35:18.720] 是啊，我也不知道该作何反应。
[00:35:22.160]  I feel like are you cleaning teeth or posting on instagram
[00:35:22.160] 我觉得你是在刷牙还是在发Instagram？
[00:35:26.560]  Yeah, and I'm like, I feel like I know too much about these two people now
[00:35:26.560] 是啊，我现在感觉我对这两个人了解得太多了。
[00:35:29.920]  Like I feel like a creep
[00:35:29.920] 我感觉自己像个怪胎。
[00:35:31.920]  Well, we talk a lot about the things that we don't really like doing
[00:35:31.920] 嗯，我们经常谈论我们不太喜欢做的事情。
[00:35:36.320]  Is there anything that surprised you that you actually do like doing?
[00:35:36.320] 有没有什么让你感到意外，但你却很喜欢做的事情？
[00:35:40.320]  So I do like doing my taxes
[00:35:40.320] 所以，我确实喜欢报税。
[00:35:42.800]  Dude, that's crazy
[00:35:42.800] 老兄，这太疯狂了
[00:35:45.520]  Never before uttered sentences
[00:35:45.520] 从未说过的话
[00:35:50.320]  But okay, I think the reason why I like doing them is because so far
[00:35:50.320] 好吧，我觉得我喜欢做这些事的原因是，到目前为止
[00:35:56.000]  I have not
[00:35:56.000]  我没有
[00:35:57.360]  Needed to like I have not made enough money to have to actually pay
[00:35:57.360] 我需要支付，但我赚的钱还不够多。
[00:36:02.000]  Taxes after I do my returns. Okay, so it's like associated with the reward, you know
[00:36:02.000] 我报税之后还要交税。好吧，这跟奖励有关，你知道的。
[00:36:07.520]  I'm like, holy shit. I'm about to be paid like another half of a paycheck or something
[00:36:07.520] 我当时就想，卧槽。我好像又要拿到半个月的工资了。
[00:36:12.560]  Like hopefully
[00:36:12.560] 希望如此
[00:36:13.840]  You know, that's a lot of sense
[00:36:13.840] 你知道，这很有道理。
[00:36:15.360]  So I'm very excited to get that
[00:36:15.360] 所以我很兴奋能得到它。
[00:36:19.040]  At the end of me doing this
[00:36:19.040] 在我做完这件事之后
[00:36:20.960]  So I feel like that's a big part of it and then second to it's
[00:36:20.960] 所以我觉得这是很重要的一部分，其次是……
[00:36:25.680]  I mean, I've heard a lot of bad things about turbo tax, but so far
[00:36:25.680] 我的意思是，我听说过很多关于TurboTax的负面评价，但到目前为止，我的体验还不错。
[00:36:28.400]  I've been using turbo tax and it's like fine
[00:36:28.400] 我一直在用TurboTax，感觉还不错。
[00:36:31.200]  It is quite straightforward
[00:36:31.200] 这很简单
[00:36:34.160]  And so as soon as I get my w2
[00:36:34.160] 所以，我一拿到W-2表格就……
[00:36:36.800]  I just upload that shit and then it like
[00:36:36.800] 我刚把那玩意儿上传完，然后它就……
[00:36:39.120]  You know parses everything and then like plugs and chug
[00:36:39.120] 你知道，它会解析所有内容，然后就像插头和大口吞咽一样。
[00:36:41.600]  I just like go and like click these buttons and then I get money
[00:36:41.600] 我只要点击这些按钮就能赚钱了。
[00:36:45.600]  Oh hell yeah
[00:36:45.600] 哦，当然！
[00:36:48.000]  Let me do this
[00:36:48.000] 让我来做这件事
[00:36:49.440]  Okay, and I'll be paid by the end. So this is probably not a universal experience for sure
[00:36:49.440] 好的，最后我会拿到报酬。所以这肯定不是普遍现象。
[00:36:55.920]  What I was saying earlier about something that I don't like doing is like dealing with other financial things
[00:36:55.920] 我之前提到的我不喜欢做的事情之一，就是处理其他财务事宜。
[00:37:01.120]  Because of my lack of dealing with other financial things. I also just like have no money
[00:37:01.120] 因为我不太会处理其他财务事宜，而且我基本上也没钱。
[00:37:06.160]  And so there's nothing for me to report on my taxes because I have no gains
[00:37:06.160] 因此，我无需在纳税申报中申报任何内容，因为我没有任何收益。
[00:37:12.720]  I'm like the simplest most basic version of turbo tax
[00:37:12.720] 我就像TurboTax最简单最基础的版本。
[00:37:17.200]  Because I don't have jack shit you're like all losses this year and they're like, okay, you could have some money back then
[00:37:17.200] 因为我一文不值，你们说我今年全亏了，然后他们就说，好吧，你以前可能还有些钱呢。
[00:37:22.880]  They're like, did you receive a 1099 blah blah blah blah blah? I'm like no no no
[00:37:22.880] 他们就问我，你收到1099表格了吗？等等等等。我就说没有没有没有。
[00:37:28.080]  Didn't get anything did not buy or sell did not do anything just sitting there
[00:37:28.080] 什么也没得到，既没买也没卖，什么也没做，就坐在那儿。
[00:37:33.120]  I have nothing and the most that I do is like I have an hsa have my 401k stuff like my regular investment things
[00:37:33.120] 我一无所有，我做的最多也就是有个健康储蓄账户（HSA）、401k退休金计划之类的，还有一些常规的投资。
[00:37:39.920]  I don't pull from it. I don't do anything with it. It's just there
[00:37:39.920] 我不会从中汲取灵感。我不会对它做任何事。它就只是在那里。
[00:37:43.200]  And so it's not that complicated for me
[00:37:43.200] 所以对我来说这并不复杂。
[00:37:46.480]  So I just like plug and chug the numbers and then and then I get my actual returns. So
[00:37:46.480] 所以我只要把数字代入公式，然后就能算出实际收益了。
[00:37:51.920]  Yay
[00:37:51.920]  耶
[00:37:52.880]  Okay, this is understandable now at first I was like damn Jessica likes doing taxes. What?
[00:37:52.880] 好吧，现在我明白了。一开始我还想，天哪，杰西卡居然喜欢报税。什么？
[00:37:59.760]  That's yeah, okay. I feel like growing up. I've always liked paperwork, which is also a controversial statement, but
[00:37:59.760] 好吧，就这样吧。我觉得自己长大了。我一直都喜欢做文书工作，这或许会引发争议，但是……
[00:38:07.040]  I
[00:38:07.040]  我
[00:38:08.480]  Do I do really like doing paperwork
[00:38:08.480] 我真的喜欢做文书工作吗？
[00:38:10.480]  So it's like things that involved some sort of paperwork or like application type of thing
[00:38:10.480] 所以，这就像是需要填写一些文件或者提交申请之类的事情。
[00:38:18.080]  Or like setting up an appointment. So like also recently I had to renew my passport, which I was extremely excited to do
[00:38:18.080] 或者像预约一样。比如最近我得更新护照，我当时特别兴奋。
[00:38:26.960]  My jaw is on the ground
[00:38:26.960] 我惊呆了
[00:38:30.240]  I was with you until the tax part. Okay, I understand there's like a prize at the end
[00:38:30.240] 直到提到税务部分，我都同意你的观点。好吧，我明白最后好像还有奖励。
[00:38:33.920]  There's like a pot of gold the passport appointment thing is truly like I'm so shocked right now
[00:38:33.920] 护照预约这件事简直就像个宝库，我真的太震惊了！
[00:38:39.440]  Wait, I'm shulking
[00:38:39.440] 等等，我在躲避
[00:38:42.880]  Shocked and balding
[00:38:42.880] 震惊且秃顶
[00:38:48.480]  Wait, it's so fun though like
[00:38:48.480] 等等，不过这真的很有趣啊！
[00:38:50.480]  The the paperwork is not even that long and then I just downloaded it and I just like
[00:38:50.480] 表格其实并不长，我下载下来之后就觉得挺好的。
[00:38:55.760]  Filled it out printed it out and then it's also like an excuse for me to like
[00:38:55.760] 填好、打印出来，这也算是给我一个喜欢它的借口吧。
[00:39:00.480]  Run errands, which I love running errands
[00:39:00.480] 跑腿办事，我喜欢跑腿办事。
[00:39:03.360]  I was like, oh like let me take my little folder with like my important paperwork and my important little passport to the
[00:39:03.360] 我当时就想，哦，让我带着装有重要文件和重要护照的小文件夹去……
[00:39:09.920]  Post office and like I mail it and I feel so like
[00:39:09.920] 去邮局寄信，感觉就像……
[00:39:13.360]  You know big girl adult like accomplishing and being productive those types of like life admin things give me
[00:39:13.360] 你知道，像大女孩那样，成熟稳重、事业有成，处理生活中的各种琐事，比如行政事务，会让我感到很累。
[00:39:20.160]  supreme satisfaction
[00:39:20.160] 极致的满足感
[00:39:22.560]  Yeah
[00:39:22.560]  是的
[00:39:23.440]  Wait, I feel like passports not bad. I just like sign a couple papers and mail it in right?
[00:39:23.440] 等等，我觉得护照好像没那么糟糕。我只要签几份文件然后寄出去就行了，对吧？
[00:39:29.200]  Yeah, you just have to do it fairly early on like before you have a trip. So you don't like risk it taking forever
[00:39:29.200] 是的，你得尽早安排，比如在旅行之前。这样才不会耽误太久。
[00:39:35.200]  Yeah, jesus. What was your bad experience with the passport? You must share now
[00:39:35.200] 是啊，我的天。你办护照的时候遇到过什么不愉快的经历？你一定要跟我说说！
[00:39:40.560]  Okay, I have to say I have also never had like a truly negative experience with my passport
[00:39:40.560] 好吧，我得说，我的护照也从来没有真正糟糕的经历。
[00:39:45.920]  But I feel like my beef with paperwork and especially very like official stuff
[00:39:45.920] 但我感觉我对文书工作，尤其是对官方文件，特别反感。
[00:39:50.880]  This includes taxes too
[00:39:50.880] 这其中也包括税款。
[00:39:52.400]  It's like I don't like the possibility that I'm like filling out something willy-nilly and then it might be wrong
[00:39:52.400] 我好像不喜欢那种随意填写表格，然后结果可能出错的感觉。
[00:39:58.640]  Or something. You know how when you do
[00:39:58.640] 或者别的什么。你知道当你这样做的时候。
[00:40:01.440]  Taxes and at the end it's like oh your risk of getting audited is oh my god
[00:40:01.440] 税收，最后你会觉得，哦，你被审计的风险简直太高了！
[00:40:06.160]  Which I honestly feel like is just like a fucking static photo like I feel like they're not running any calculations
[00:40:06.160] 说实话，我觉得这就像一张静态照片，感觉他们根本没做任何计算。
[00:40:11.040]  It's just like they tell everyone that and then they're like, oh, but do you want audit defense for $50?
[00:40:11.040] 他们就像是跟每个人都这么说，然后又会说，哦，但是你想花 50 美元做审计辩护吗？
[00:40:16.320]  I don't buy it because I'm like how is turbo tax gonna protect me from getting audited by the government
[00:40:16.320] 我不相信，因为我在想，TurboTax 怎么能保护我免受政府审计呢？
[00:40:23.040]  But I don't like the fact that the risk of getting audited is there
[00:40:23.040] 但我并不喜欢存在被审计的风险。
[00:40:27.440]  So I feel like it's like when it's too official. I'm like, oh like I don't want to do with that
[00:40:27.440] 所以我觉得，当一切都太正式的时候，我就会想，哦，我不想那样。
[00:40:31.840]  Okay, yeah, I always get scared by that every time like it's anxiety inducing
[00:40:31.840] 好吧，是的，我每次看到那个都会感到害怕，感觉很焦虑。
[00:40:36.880]  I'm like wait, but then I I slow down and I think about it. I'm like, okay. Why the fuck with the irs
[00:40:36.880] 我当时想，等等，但后来我冷静下来仔细想了想。我就想，好吧。为什么国税局要来这套？
[00:40:42.720]  audit me out of like
[00:40:42.720] 审计我，就像
[00:40:44.880]  Millions of people in like the us like why would they audit me?
[00:40:44.880] 像美国这样的国家有数百万人都想问，他们为什么要审计我？
[00:40:50.960]  Yeah, I actually used to like doing taxes like Jessica, but that was when I could get returns
[00:40:50.960] 是啊，我以前也挺喜欢像杰西卡那样报税的，不过那时候我还能拿到退税。
[00:40:57.280]  And then I experienced paying taxes and I was like, whoa, I don't think this is not worth
[00:40:57.280] 然后我体验了缴税，我就想，哇，我觉得这不值得。
[00:41:05.680]  I was like, this isn't fun anymore
[00:41:05.680] 我当时就想，这没意思了。
[00:41:12.640]  Do you all procrastinate on your taxes though?
[00:41:12.640] 你们都会拖延报税吗？
[00:41:15.040]  I feel like that's the quintessential adult thing to do
[00:41:15.040] 我觉得这才是成年人该做的典型事情。
[00:41:18.880]  To complain about it till the last minute and then be like, oh, yeah, I did it like the weekend before tax day
[00:41:18.880] 一直抱怨到最后一刻，然后说，哦，对，我在报税日前那个周末就搞定了。
[00:41:24.880]  So I'm like very proud of myself this year because I completed my taxes a whole week
[00:41:24.880] 所以今年我特别自豪，因为我只用了一整周就完成了报税。
[00:41:31.280]  Before the deadline and I was kind of laughing about it because when you file your turbo tax
[00:41:31.280] 在截止日期之前，我当时还挺想笑的，因为当你提交TurboTax报税表的时候……
[00:41:36.080]  It always pulls in your last year's return and like the file so that you can kind of compare
[00:41:36.080] 它总是会调取你去年提交的报税表和相关文件，以便你可以进行比较。
[00:41:40.240]  And it was like, oh last year you submitted your taxes on 417
[00:41:40.240] 然后就好像，哦，你去年在417号表格上提交了税表。
[00:41:44.560]  And the tax day last year was 418 and I was like, dude, what is wrong with me? Like truly
[00:41:44.560] 去年报税截止日期是4月18日，我当时就想，老兄，我这是怎么了？真的。
[00:41:50.960]  I can understand waiting till April but day before is actually that's like a choice
[00:41:50.960] 我能理解等到四月，但提前一天就真的是一种选择。
[00:41:55.440]  That was like an active decision made by me
[00:41:55.440] 那就像是我主动做出的决定。
[00:41:58.640]  Oh my god
[00:41:58.640]  我的天啊
[00:42:00.000]  I think I'm usually a couple weeks ahead
[00:42:00.000] 我通常都能提前两周左右掌握信息。
[00:42:04.000]  The earliest I've ever done it is
[00:42:04.000] 我最早做过一次是
[00:42:07.040]  Two months ahead because I had to move in March
[00:42:07.040] 提前两个月，因为我三月份就要搬家了。
[00:42:10.720]  So I was like, okay, I might as well just get this out of the way
[00:42:10.720] 所以我就想，好吧，我最好还是把这件事解决掉。
[00:42:13.440]  So I did it like early February or something like that
[00:42:13.440] 所以我大概在二月初左右做的。
[00:42:16.560]  But I think last year I did it the week of tax day and this year it's looking like it might be similar
[00:42:16.560] 但我记得去年我是在报税截止日期那周报的，今年看来可能也差不多。
[00:42:24.640]  I feel like so far I've been doing them in like February
[00:42:24.640] 我觉得到目前为止，我都是在二月份做这些事的。
[00:42:28.800]  Generally when the W2 gets released
[00:42:28.800] 通常情况下，W2发布的时候
[00:42:32.400]  Because I've been talking about it with my coworkers this year
[00:42:32.400] 因为我今年一直在和同事们谈论这件事。
[00:42:35.520]  And I feel like there's actually some merit to waiting a little bit
[00:42:35.520] 我觉得稍微等等也确实有好处。
[00:42:41.040]  Maybe not like the day before or the week before
[00:42:41.040] 或许不像前一天或前一周那样。
[00:42:44.560]  Hey, that was once
[00:42:44.560] 嘿，那已经是过去的事了。
[00:42:49.200]  But I mean I feel like filing it then is fine as long as you have it figured out before then because what we were talking about was
[00:42:49.200] 但我觉得，只要你事先想清楚了，那时候提交也没问题，因为我们刚才讨论的是……
[00:42:57.280]  That there were quite a few people like coworkers who I talked to this year who there was like a mistake on their W2
[00:42:57.280] 今年我跟不少同事聊过，他们都说自己的W2表格有误。
[00:43:05.040]  And I was like, oh my god
[00:43:05.040] 我当时就想，我的天哪
[00:43:06.560]  I've never even considered that to be a possibility like that's never happened to me
[00:43:06.560] 我从来没想过会有这种可能性，这种事从来没发生在我身上过。
[00:43:10.720]  But then I'm also like maybe that has happened to me. I'm just like
[00:43:10.720] 但后来我又想，也许我也经历过这种事。我当时就想……
[00:43:15.120]  Speeding through it and not catching it or like not, you know
[00:43:15.120] 飞速穿过却没能抓住它，或者说根本没抓住，你知道的。
[00:43:18.480]  I feel like it's I mean with like the puny amount of money that I make it's like probably not that much
[00:43:18.480] 我觉得，就我那点可怜的收入来说，可能也没多少。
[00:43:22.880]  But my Parker is talking about how the math was not math thing on their taxes
[00:43:22.880] 但我帕克说的是，他们税款上的数学问题根本不是数学问题。
[00:43:28.320]  And so they like went back to their W2 and like
[00:43:28.320] 所以他们就回到了他们的W2表格，然后……
[00:43:31.280]  Went line by line and figured out that there was a mistake and was like comparing it to their like paystas and stuff like that
[00:43:31.280] 一行一行地核对，发现有个错误，然后把它跟他们的付款方式之类的东西做了对比。
[00:43:37.840]  Like crazy stuff. So I was like, whoa
[00:43:37.840] 简直太疯狂了。所以我就想，哇哦。
[00:43:40.720]  That didn't even occur to me
[00:43:40.720] 我根本没想到这一点。
[00:43:43.200]  Maybe next year I would be a little bit more diligent and like
[00:43:43.200] 也许明年我会更勤奋一些，而且会……
[00:43:47.680]  Actually checking a little bit more
[00:43:47.680] 实际上，还要再仔细检查一下。
[00:43:50.720]  To just make sure that things look correct. Yeah before rushing to submit
[00:43:50.720] 只是为了确保一切看起来都没问题。是的，在匆忙提交之前。
[00:43:57.440]  But then even then I think starting the paperwork and filing early
[00:43:57.440] 但即便如此，我认为尽早开始准备文件和提交申请也是明智之举。
[00:44:02.160]  Just not submitting early
[00:44:02.160] 只是没有提前提交。
[00:44:03.520]  It's still beneficial, right? Because if you catch the mistake you have the time to like
[00:44:03.520] 这仍然有好处，对吧？因为如果你发现了错误，你还有时间去喜欢它。
[00:44:07.600]  Tell the company get your updated W2 and all that
[00:44:07.600] 告诉公司去拿你更新后的W2表格等等。
[00:44:11.200]  But if you did wait till the you know last minute, you'd be like wait shoot. Can I get an extension? Like I'm fucked
[00:44:11.200] 但如果你等到最后一刻，你就会想：糟了，我能延期吗？感觉自己完蛋了。
[00:44:17.760]  Maybe like get the calculator. I'm doing this right now
[00:44:17.760] 或许可以拿个计算器。我现在就在用。
[00:44:22.880]  You're like you would probably have to hire an accountant at that point
[00:44:22.880] 感觉你到时候可能就得雇个会计了。
[00:44:27.680]  Dude, I think the dream is someday you're comfortable enough to like hire an accountant to do your taxes for you
[00:44:27.680] 兄弟，我觉得你的梦想就是有一天你能经济宽裕到可以雇个会计师帮你报税。
[00:44:34.720]  That would be amazing
[00:44:34.720] 那真是太棒了！
[00:44:36.080]  Yeah, dude, but I'm just laughing at Jessica just being like they wake up my w2 just drop
[00:44:36.080] 是啊，兄弟，我只是觉得杰西卡那句“他们叫醒我，我的W-2表格就这么掉了”特别搞笑。
[00:44:47.280]  I'm like logging on to adp every day. Is it here yet? Like do I have a yeah?
[00:44:47.280] 我几乎每天都登录ADP网站。它到了吗？我能收到“到了”的回复吗？
[00:44:53.440]  Okay one thing
[00:44:53.440] 好的，一件事
[00:44:54.960]  That I think you sometimes have to wait a bit for
[00:44:54.960] 我觉得有时候你需要耐心等待一段时间。
[00:44:59.280]  But usually I think you don't have to wait later than like mid
[00:44:59.280] 但通常我觉得你不用等到中午以后。
[00:45:03.680]  To end of February but like sometimes if you have a
[00:45:03.680] 到二月底，但有时候如果你有
[00:45:07.360]  A trading account
[00:45:07.360] 交易账户
[00:45:08.320]  I think there's some paperwork that you get from them and then they usually send that out towards like
[00:45:08.320] 我想你会收到他们发来的一些文件，然后他们通常会把这些文件寄出去，比如……
[00:45:13.680]  February or something
[00:45:13.680] 二月或者什么的
[00:45:14.800]  So I remember like that year that I did it early
[00:45:14.800] 所以我记得那一年我早早就做了这件事。
[00:45:17.120]  I was like waiting for it to come out. It's like, please I need this to come out so I can do my taxes
[00:45:17.120] 我当时就等着它出来呢。我简直太需要它出来了，我得赶紧报税。
[00:45:21.440]  Before I like don't know when I can do them next
[00:45:21.440] 之前我不知道什么时候才能再做这些。
[00:45:24.640]  True
[00:45:24.640]  真的
[00:45:25.360]  It's honestly so funny though because when the tax documents are ready
[00:45:25.360] 说真的，这事儿太搞笑了，因为当税务文件都准备好的时候……
[00:45:29.520]  It shoots you an email, right? And it's like, oh your tax documents are ready in your account
[00:45:29.520] 它会给你发封邮件，对吧？邮件里会说，哦，你的税务文件已经准备好发送到你的账户了。
[00:45:33.360]  and I feel like I always click through and
[00:45:33.360] 我觉得我总是会点击进去，
[00:45:35.920]  I think similar to Jessica like I'm not huge into investing and stuff like I kind of let
[00:45:35.920] 我觉得我和杰西卡有点像，我对投资之类的东西不太感兴趣，我有点儿放任不管。
[00:45:39.920]  James handle it if he wants to or if not, just don't ask me financial advice basically
[00:45:39.920] 詹姆斯想处理就处理，不想处理的话，就别问我理财建议了。
[00:45:44.720]  So when I open the documents sometimes it's like, oh, please report this on your taxes this year
[00:45:44.720] 所以，当我打开文件时，有时会看到这样的提示：哦，请在今年的税表中申报这个。
[00:45:49.600]  It's like $15. I'm like bro
[00:45:49.600] 大概15美元吧。我当时就想，兄弟。
[00:45:53.760]  Like are you sure I'm like the fact that I have to report this is crazy
[00:45:53.760] 我真的确定吗？我居然还要举报这件事，这太疯狂了。
[00:45:58.000]  I know
[00:45:58.000]  我知道
[00:45:59.120]  It's like less than a $20 bill
[00:45:59.120] 这相当于不到20美元的钞票
[00:46:02.080]  I think I like fucked up somewhere along the way too because
[00:46:02.080] 我觉得我也在某个环节搞砸了，因为
[00:46:06.000]  My first job I had a 401k
[00:46:06.000] 我的第一份工作有401k退休金计划。
[00:46:09.600]  And instead of rolling it over to my new jobs 401k, I just rolled it over to a personal
[00:46:09.600] 我没有把这笔钱转到新工作的401k账户，而是转到了个人账户。
[00:46:16.000]  IRA account I guess
[00:46:16.000] 我猜是IRA账户。
[00:46:17.760]  And so now I always have to submit the like info for that
[00:46:17.760] 所以现在我总是要提交点赞信息。
[00:46:21.680]  And I'm like
[00:46:21.680] 我当时就想：
[00:46:23.360]  Okay, like why did I do this? I'm a fool
[00:46:23.360] 好吧，我为什么要这么做？我真是个傻瓜。
[00:46:26.320]  I have to manage this account myself now and like report about it
[00:46:26.320] 我现在必须自己管理这个账户，比如汇报情况。
[00:46:30.960]  I just like low key stop touching it because
[00:46:30.960] 我只是想悄悄地别再碰它了，因为
[00:46:33.920]  Luckily there's not that much money in it because I think I only worked for a year with that job
[00:46:33.920] 幸好那份工作赚不了多少钱，因为我好像只做了一年。
[00:46:38.240]  So I was like, okay, I'll just like leave it be so I don't have to worry too much
[00:46:38.240] 所以我就想，好吧，那就顺其自然吧，免得我太担心。
[00:46:42.400]  I could send in like blank statements. Yeah, dude. Here's my fucking beef with taxes, by the way
[00:46:42.400] 我可以提交空白报表。是啊，老兄。顺便说一句，这就是我对税收的怨气。
[00:46:47.520]  I don't understand how when you open something you have to give everyone at least financial institutions your social security number
[00:46:47.520] 我不明白为什么开办公司的时候，至少要把社会安全号码提供给所有金融机构。
[00:46:54.160]  So I'm like you guys have all our info. Why don't you do your
[00:46:54.160] 所以我就想，你们掌握了我们所有的信息。为什么你们不做你们的……
[00:46:57.600]  Like do our taxes
[00:46:57.600] 就像我们的税收一样
[00:46:59.680]  Wait, that's true. Like if they're gonna check our taxes
[00:46:59.680] 等等，还真是这样。比如说，他们要是真要查我们的税单就好了。
[00:47:02.960]  Doesn't that mean they're doing it too? Like why don't they just I think I saw a meme once that was like the IRS is basically like
[00:47:02.960] 那岂不是说他们也在这么做？比如，为什么他们不……我好像曾经看过一个梗图，大概意思是说美国国税局基本上就是……
[00:47:11.040]  Oh, you have taxes due and then you respond like oh, how much they're like, heehee. I won't tell you you have to calculate it yourself
[00:47:11.040] 哦，你得交税了，然后你就说，哦，要交多少税啊，呵呵。我就不告诉你了，你自己算吧。
[00:47:21.120]  So true
[00:47:21.120]  如此真实
[00:47:23.440]  I think what actually happens though is like
[00:47:23.440] 我觉得实际发生的事情是这样的
[00:47:26.240]  I'm pretty sure turbo tax and like other companies who have these types of products
[00:47:26.240] 我相当确定TurboTax以及其他提供这类产品的公司都是如此。
[00:47:32.400]  Lobby the shit out of the government to like not provide
[00:47:32.400] 拼命游说政府，让他们不要提供
[00:47:36.720]  The taxing like filing for free and I know there are free
[00:47:36.720] 征税就像免费申报一样，我知道有免费的。
[00:47:40.880]  Programs out there and I think
[00:47:40.880] 市面上有很多项目，我认为
[00:47:43.200]  One might be new for this year or from last year or something that is actually like from the government
[00:47:43.200] 其中一项可能是今年的新规定，也可能是去年的规定，或者实际上是来自政府的规定。
[00:47:49.200]  That allows you to like file taxes like directly with the government
[00:47:49.200] 这样你就可以直接向政府报税了。
[00:47:52.320]  But I haven't used it. I think I I mean I saw on tech talking people were like use this instead of turbo tax
[00:47:52.320] 但我还没用过。我好像在科技论坛上看到有人说可以用这个代替TurboTax。
[00:47:57.520]  Well blah, but I don't know actually like how user friendly it is and like I mean considering that's built by the government
[00:47:57.520] 嗯，算了，不过我不太清楚它到底有多用户友好，我的意思是，考虑到它是政府开发的。
[00:48:03.440]  It's probably not that user friendly
[00:48:03.440] 它可能不太方便用户使用。
[00:48:05.520]  I'm like is there audit defense on it?
[00:48:05.520] 我想知道这方面是否有审计辩护？
[00:48:09.520]  For $50 or is that for you?
[00:48:09.520] 50美元？还是给你的？
[00:48:12.800]  So I think now we've talked about adulting tasks that are fun and exciting for us versus
[00:48:12.800] 所以我觉得我们现在已经讨论过哪些成人任务对我们来说既有趣又令人兴奋了。
[00:48:18.160]  Tasks that maybe feel a little bit more boring
[00:48:18.160] 一些可能感觉有点无聊的任务
[00:48:20.880]  But the reality of being an adult is that whether it's boring or fun. You still have to like do everything and get all your
[00:48:20.880] 但成年人的现实是，无论生活是无聊还是有趣，你仍然需要做所有的事情，完成所有的事情。
[00:48:26.560]  Shit done. So is there anything that you guys do to kind of?
[00:48:26.560] 事情搞定了。所以你们有什么办法来应对这种情况吗？
[00:48:31.120]  Inspire yourself to tackle these tasks that you might find boring
[00:48:31.120] 激励自己去完成这些你可能觉得无聊的任务。
[00:48:34.560]  So I was talking to gc about this
[00:48:34.560] 所以我跟gc聊起了这件事。
[00:48:36.960]  and
[00:48:36.960]  和
[00:48:38.080]  One thing that I do is I have a lot of
[00:48:38.080] 我做的一件事就是我有很多
[00:48:41.680]  YouTubers who I follow
[00:48:41.680] 我关注的YouTube博主
[00:48:43.680]  Some of them will make these productive day in the life with me videos or
[00:48:43.680] 他们中的一些人会制作这些记录我充实一天的视频，或者
[00:48:49.280]  I also watch a lot of like cleaning videos
[00:48:49.280] 我也经常看一些清洁类的视频。
[00:48:52.560]  And like organizational videos that bring me a lot of joy
[00:48:52.560] 还有那些让我非常开心的组织类视频。
[00:48:56.320]  Usually what I'll do is like if I'm
[00:48:56.320] 通常我会这样做，比如如果我
[00:48:59.840]  Eating dinner or lunch or something
[00:48:59.840] 吃晚饭或午饭之类的
[00:49:02.080]  I put on one of these like, you know productive day in the life videos
[00:49:02.080] 我放了一个那种展示高效一天生活的视频。
[00:49:05.280]  Or like watch me clean and stuff like that that those videos really really inspire me
[00:49:05.280] 或者像看我打扫卫生之类的视频，那些视频真的给了我很大的启发。
[00:49:11.040]  To go and clean and organize afterwards
[00:49:11.040] 之后去清理和整理。
[00:49:14.880]  Yeah, I feel like those are usually almost like nine out of ten times
[00:49:14.880] 是的，我觉得这种情况十次里有九次都可能发生。
[00:49:18.480]  I'm inspired after watching those videos and I'll like go and deep clean my kitchen or if I'm watching it at like 10
[00:49:18.480] 看完那些视频后我深受启发，然后就会去彻底清洁厨房，或者如果我是在晚上10点左右看的。
[00:49:25.120]  P.m. I'll like get out of bed and like start sweeping the floor or like cleaning the counters or some shit
[00:49:25.120] 下午，我大概会起床，然后开始扫地或者擦台面什么的。
[00:49:30.960]  It's highly effective
[00:49:30.960] 它非常有效
[00:49:32.960]  I would recommend dude. You're basically pre-gaming all your adulting tasks by watching someone else do it
[00:49:32.960] 我推荐你这么做，兄弟。你基本上就是通过观看别人做事情来预先完成所有成年人该做的事情。
[00:49:39.600]  I feel like that does help a lot
[00:49:39.600] 我觉得这确实很有帮助。
[00:49:42.400]  Yeah, like seeing other people be productive in a really like
[00:49:42.400] 是啊，就像看到其他人高效工作一样。
[00:49:47.360]  Efficient or a satisfying way totally makes you feel like wait. I can do that too. Like let me go do it
[00:49:47.360] 高效或令人满意的方式完全会让你觉得“等等，我也能做到。让我来做吧。”
[00:49:52.800]  I can relate to that. I think it inspires me sometimes too
[00:49:52.800] 我能理解。我觉得它有时也能激励我。
[00:49:56.880]  I actually focused more on the after
[00:49:56.880] 我其实更关注的是之后的事情。
[00:50:00.160]  So i'm like, oh, you know like after I do this I deserve a treat
[00:50:00.160] 所以我就想，哦，你知道，做完这件事之后，我应该犒劳一下自己。
[00:50:05.520]  Yes
[00:50:05.520]  是的
[00:50:06.880]  That too
[00:50:06.880] 也是
[00:50:07.920]  Yeah, I did my taxes. So you know, I deserve to eat a yummy meal today or something like that
[00:50:07.920] 是的，我报税了。所以你知道，我今天应该好好犒劳自己一顿。
[00:50:14.560]  Like a reward system exactly exactly
[00:50:14.560] 就像一个奖励系统，完全一样。
[00:50:17.440]  Dude, that reminds me of when people used to study and then on textbooks they would like put m&m's or some shit
[00:50:17.440] 老兄，这让我想起以前人们学习的时候，会在课本上贴些M&M巧克力豆之类的东西。
[00:50:22.480]  So it's like after you read this passage you eat the something
[00:50:22.480] 所以，就像你读完这段话之后，就吃点东西一样。
[00:50:25.280]  whoa
[00:50:25.280] 哇
[00:50:26.880]  I feel like another thing is
[00:50:26.880] 我觉得还有另一件事是
[00:50:29.200]  You know how
[00:50:29.200] 你知道的
[00:50:30.320]  When you're like for example trying to get into like running or like working out you buy yourself cute running shoes
[00:50:30.320] 例如，当你想要开始跑步或健身时，你会给自己买一双漂亮的跑鞋。
[00:50:35.600]  Oh my god, you're like yes cute workout clothes and you're like, okay. I'm like so excited to go to the gym
[00:50:35.600] 我的天哪，你就像看到可爱的运动服一样，然后说，好啊。我简直太兴奋了，迫不及待地想去健身房。
[00:50:40.000]  We're so excited to go running
[00:50:40.000] 我们太兴奋了，迫不及待地想去跑步！
[00:50:42.160]  And I feel like there's definitely some of that for me
[00:50:42.160] 我觉得我身上肯定也有一些这样的特质。
[00:50:45.840]  Organizing or like cleaning or like doing some life admin stuff
[00:50:45.840] 整理东西、打扫卫生或者处理一些生活琐事
[00:50:49.200]  Maybe I get to you know, like I'll go to Target. I'll buy like a new scrub daddy or
[00:50:49.200] 也许我会去，比如去塔吉特百货，买个新的工作服之类的。
[00:50:57.360]  Like I'm like, okay, I'm gonna try a new brand of like all-purpose cleaner and
[00:50:57.360] 我就想，好吧，我要试试一种新的多用途清洁剂品牌，
[00:51:02.720]  I actually understand. No, I agree. I agree sometimes buying those cleaning supplies you're like, oh, yeah, I'm gonna go home and clean
[00:51:02.720] 我其实明白。不，我同意。我同意，有时候买清洁用品的时候你会想，哦，对，我要回家打扫一下。
[00:51:10.640]  Yeah, but the problem with that method is sometimes I feel like I get so into the research of like, oh, what should I buy?
[00:51:10.640] 是的，但这种方法的缺点是，有时我觉得我会过于沉迷于研究，比如，哦，我应该买什么？
[00:51:16.720]  And then I buy it. I'm like, yeah, I don't want to do this anymore
[00:51:16.720] 然后我就买了。我就想，是啊，我不想再做这件事了。
[00:51:21.040]  Wait, so that's why you need a you need to pair it with like the video
[00:51:21.040] 等等，所以这就是为什么你需要把它和视频搭配使用的原因
[00:51:24.880]  So you watch the videos and they're like, oh like I recommend this brand at this brand
[00:51:24.880] 所以你看视频，他们会说，哦，我推荐这个品牌，那个品牌
[00:51:29.440]  You're like, oh, holy shit. You got a target you buy that shit come back
[00:51:29.440] 你会想，哦，我的天哪。你找到了目标，买了那玩意儿，然后回来
[00:51:32.720]  Like watch the video again see how they use it and then you start using it, you know
[00:51:32.720] 比如，再看一遍视频，看看他们是怎么用的，然后你也开始用，你知道的。
[00:51:36.560]  The cocktail of like pre-gaming
[00:51:36.560] 就像赛前鸡尾酒一样
[00:51:42.240]  Okay, I also actually think planning ahead helps a lot so I'm thinking of like taxes
[00:51:42.240] 好的，我也觉得提前规划很有帮助，比如我想到的是税收方面的事情。
[00:51:48.400]  I kind of like budget for that almost I'll make sure to spend more responsibly for the
[00:51:48.400] 我挺喜欢为此做预算的，我会确保更负责任地花钱。
[00:51:53.680]  You know quarter one make sure that I'm like also mentally prepared
[00:51:53.680] 你知道，第一季度要确保我也做好了心理准备。
[00:51:58.640]  Expect the worst and then you know, everything will be better when you're actually doing it
[00:51:58.640] 做好最坏的打算，然后你就会明白，当你真正去做的时候，一切都会好起来的。
[00:52:03.200]  I think that makes a ton of sense and mine is kind of similar to both of your guys's because I feel like there is some sort of
[00:52:03.200] 我觉得这很有道理，我的想法和你们俩的有点类似，因为我觉得其中存在某种……
[00:52:09.120]  merit of like
[00:52:09.120] 优点
[00:52:10.320]  Pulling the mood together like getting into the right mood to tackle something
[00:52:10.320] 调整好情绪，就像调整好心态去应对某件事一样。
[00:52:14.160]  But I also think that planning can help you get into that mood even further
[00:52:14.160] 但我认为，计划也能帮助你更好地进入那种状态。
[00:52:18.720]  So for me, I feel like if I know I have all this car stuff to do or all this financial stuff to do
[00:52:18.720] 所以对我来说，我觉得如果我知道自己有很多汽车方面的事情要做，或者有很多财务方面的事情要做，我就会更有动力。
[00:52:24.160]  I'll like batch the tasks so that I can just like tackle all of it and like get it all done in one go
[00:52:24.160] 我喜欢把任务批量处理，这样我就可以一次性全部完成。
[00:52:29.600]  And that helps with like crossing a bunch of shit off the list
[00:52:29.600] 这样就能帮你把清单上的很多事情都划掉。
[00:52:32.480]  But also even within the financial task
[00:52:32.480] 但即使在财务任务中也是如此。
[00:52:35.120]  I feel like some things are fun to do and some things are like
[00:52:35.120] 我觉得有些事做起来很有趣，有些事则像……
[00:52:38.080]  Boring so kind of like alternating between those and making sure you have that good balance helps a lot too
[00:52:38.080] 无聊的话，交替进行这些活动，确保保持良好的平衡也很有帮助。
[00:52:43.760]  Yeah
[00:52:43.760]  是的
[00:52:44.160]  If I'm looking at the list of things that you know, quote unquote life admin
[00:52:44.160] 如果我查看你所知道的事情清单，也就是所谓的“生活管理”，
[00:52:49.440]  Requires you to do from like taxes to like, you know booking your your insurance stuff
[00:52:49.440] 需要你处理从报税到预订保险之类的事情。
[00:52:55.760]  Doing that to even like meal planning and like buying your groceries and like having all of that planned out
[00:52:55.760] 这样做甚至会让人喜欢上制定膳食计划、购买食材以及把所有这些都安排好。
[00:53:01.440]  I feel like the things that
[00:53:01.440] 我觉得那些事情
[00:53:03.520]  motivate me the most are the ones where
[00:53:03.520] 最能激励我的是那些
[00:53:07.040]  For example for me taxes where I'm like getting some kind of benefit back or like renew my passport where it's like
[00:53:07.040] 例如，对我来说，比如退税，或者更新护照，就像……
[00:53:13.520]  I get a shiny new passport and honestly like I don't even mind going to the dnb to like get a new
[00:53:13.520] 我拿到一本崭新的护照，说实话，我甚至不介意去护照办公室办个新护照。
[00:53:19.680]  license because
[00:53:19.680] 因为获得许可
[00:53:21.760]  that I get a new license
[00:53:21.760] 我会拿到新驾照
[00:53:23.920]  Wait, I like that mindset though. You're like focusing on the reward aspect of it. Yeah
[00:53:23.920] 等等，不过我喜欢这种心态。你好像更关注其中的回报方面。是的。
[00:53:29.440]  I think I'm also very motivated by like
[00:53:29.440] 我觉得我也深受以下因素的激励：
[00:53:33.040]  Having a booking on my calendar or like seeing the little bits of progress that you're making
[00:53:33.040] 我喜欢在日历上看到预约，或者喜欢看到你取得的点点滴滴的进展。
[00:53:38.800]  Even if I don't you know, enjoy being at the dentist
[00:53:38.800] 即使我不喜欢看牙医，你知道的
[00:53:42.000]  I get a lot of joy out of booking my appointment to go to the dentist
[00:53:42.000] 预约看牙医这件事让我感到非常开心。
[00:53:46.160]  That makes me feel really productive
[00:53:46.160] 这让我感觉自己效率很高。
[00:53:48.480]  And so if it's stuff that I don't necessarily want to do or like sit down and do
[00:53:48.480] 所以，如果有些事情我并不想做，或者不想坐下来去做，那我就不想做了。
[00:53:53.920]  I feel like it could be beneficial to like
[00:53:53.920] 我觉得喜欢它可能是有益的。
[00:53:56.560]  I don't know just like book time on your calendar to be like, okay this day
[00:53:56.560] 我不知道，就像在日历上预留时间，比如，好的，就在这一天。
[00:54:00.080]  I'm like, we're gonna go to a coffee shop and like sit down and like just like knock the sound
[00:54:00.080] 我就想，我们去咖啡馆坐坐，然后把声音关掉吧。
[00:54:03.600]  It's like an appointment with myself and or you know with somebody else get some friends together and like have like a
[00:54:03.600] 这就像是和自己或者其他人约好时间，和朋友们聚聚，一起……
[00:54:10.480]  tax filing party
[00:54:10.480] 税务申报方
[00:54:14.640]  I don't know about that one, but
[00:54:14.640] 我对此并不了解，但是
[00:54:17.360]  I will say though sometimes I see my parents doing their taxes together and I'm like, wow they actually have someone to do
[00:54:17.360] 不过有时候我看到父母一起报税，就会想，哇，他们居然有人一起做这件事。
[00:54:25.200]  You know to like suffer together with me while I'm in my room doing it myself
[00:54:25.200] 你知道，就像我独自在房间里做这件事时，要和我一起承受痛苦一样。
[00:54:29.680]  So I have a question
[00:54:29.680] 我有个问题
[00:54:31.440]  Jisoo since you're now married
[00:54:31.440] Jisoo，既然你现在已经结婚了。
[00:54:33.840]  You do have someone who can either do taxes with you at the same time or like file together with you
[00:54:33.840] 你确实可以找到人陪你一起报税，或者和你一起申报。
[00:54:40.160]  Do you feel like that is
[00:54:40.160] 你觉得是这样吗？
[00:54:41.920]  Like a better feeling than doing it by yourself
[00:54:41.920] 感觉比自己做要好得多
[00:54:44.400]  I think it definitely is and
[00:54:44.400] 我认为这绝对是。
[00:54:46.720]  To be honest since James and I have been living together like
[00:54:46.720] 说实话，自从我和詹姆斯住在一起以来，就像
[00:54:49.600]  Since we started first filing taxes probably I feel like we've always done taxes together, which has been great
[00:54:49.600] 自从我们第一次一起报税以来，我觉得我们一直都是一起报税的，这感觉很棒。
[00:54:55.360]  And it's kind of nice because
[00:54:55.360] 这挺好的，因为
[00:54:57.360]  It's not like oh shit like when can I fit in taxes into my schedule?
[00:54:57.360] 这不像是那种“糟糕，我什么时候才能把报税安排进我的日程里？”的情况。
[00:55:00.160]  It's like oh when can we fit in taxes into ours?
[00:55:00.160] 这就像，哦，我们什么时候才能把税收纳入我们的计划呢？
[00:55:04.240]  So at least there's two brains thinking about it. Yeah, I feel like it's nice too because sometimes when I'm by myself
[00:55:04.240] 所以至少有两个人在思考这个问题。是啊，我觉得这样也挺好的，因为有时候我一个人待着的时候……
[00:55:09.760]  I'm like yo what the fuck is happening like I need some help right now
[00:55:09.760] 我当时就想，这他妈到底是怎么回事？我现在需要帮助。
[00:55:13.440]  What does this mean? Is this applicable to me?
[00:55:13.440] 这是什么意思？这适用于我吗？
[00:55:16.720]  To be fair
[00:55:16.720] 公平地说
[00:55:17.280]  I do think the tax app that I use
[00:55:17.280] 我确实觉得我使用的税务应用程序不错。
[00:55:19.840]  Tries its best to explain everything but I feel like sometimes you're still very lost
[00:55:19.840] 它尽力解释一切，但我觉得有时候你还是会感到非常困惑。
[00:55:23.840]  Like we're still relatively new in the grand scheme of things to doing taxes
[00:55:23.840] 从整体上看，我们在税务方面还算是比较新的领域。
[00:55:27.840]  So I'm like okay some of these more complicated things. I literally don't know what's happening
[00:55:27.840] 所以我就想，好吧，有些事情比较复杂。我真的不知道发生了什么。
[00:55:32.160]  And to be honest there's like many instances where whether it's taxes or other like
[00:55:32.160] 说实话，有很多情况下，无论是税收还是其他方面……
[00:55:37.680]  Kind of adulting related tasks where we James and I still call our parents and we're like mom like how do you do this?
[00:55:37.680] 一些与成年人生活相关的任务，比如我和詹姆斯仍然会打电话给父母，问妈妈：“你是怎么做到的？”
[00:55:44.080]  Like please help
[00:55:44.080] 请帮忙点赞
[00:55:45.520]  And now that we're 27 28, I feel like it's kind of like less funny
[00:55:45.520] 现在我们都27、28岁了，我觉得这事儿没那么好笑了。
[00:55:49.520]  But honestly like you know call a parent chance always exists. It's like always out there. So
[00:55:49.520] 但说实话，你知道，给父母打电话的机会总是存在的。它总是存在的。
[00:55:54.960]  Dude, that's always a backup
[00:55:54.960] 兄弟，那始终是个备用方案。
[00:55:56.800]  The craziest shit was actually the first time setting up my 401k
[00:55:56.800] 最疯狂的事其实是我第一次设立401k账户的时候。
[00:56:01.120]  I was like, oh my god. What is going on? Like what is maxing it out mean?
[00:56:01.120] 我当时就想，我的天哪。这是怎么回事？“达到极限”到底是什么意思？
[00:56:04.720]  Like you know what how do I do this and my parents were like, yo, I don't know that shit either
[00:56:04.720] 你知道吗，我该怎么做？我爸妈就说，哎，他们也不知道啊。
[00:56:08.720]  Like you're on and I was like wait
[00:56:08.720] 就像你在线，而我当时想的是等等
[00:56:10.880]  Like do you guys not have one?
[00:56:10.880] 你们难道没有吗？
[00:56:12.880]  They're like, hmm. I suggest you look into it yourself like I'm not sure we can help you
[00:56:12.880] 他们会说：“嗯……我建议你自己去查一下，我不确定我们能不能帮到你。”
[00:56:18.000]  I was like, oh my god
[00:56:18.000] 我当时就想，我的天哪
[00:56:20.880]  Wait, my mom literally just gave me wrong information this year
[00:56:20.880] 等等，我妈今年居然给了我错误信息？
[00:56:26.880]  Like she kept bothering me about I'm like, I already filed my taxes like there's nothing but she kept badgering me about like my company stocks
[00:56:26.880] 她一直纠缠我，我说我已经报税了，没什么事了，但她还是不停地追问我的公司股票之类的事情。
[00:56:34.720]  Oh, yeah
[00:56:34.720] 哦，是的
[00:56:35.120]  So for my dad
[00:56:35.120] 所以，对于我爸爸来说……
[00:56:36.720]  I think his company or one of his previous comes here or whatever like the way that they
[00:56:36.720] 我认为他的公司或者他以前的某个人来过这里，或者其他什么人，就像他们那样。
[00:56:41.440]  Vest their stocks and like or like it vests for you is that they
[00:56:41.440] 他们的股票归属，就像它对你来说归属一样，就是他们
[00:56:45.600]  Sell part of your stock to cover for the taxes like that
[00:56:45.600] 卖掉部分股票来支付类似的税款
[00:56:49.760]  The stocks that you receive, right?
[00:56:49.760] 你收到的股票，对吧？
[00:56:51.360]  And so it counts as like a sale even though you yourself did not sell anything but they'll like sell it for you
[00:56:51.360] 所以即使你自己什么都没卖，他们也会帮你卖，这也算作一笔销售。
[00:56:57.440]  And so you need to like report that in your tax returns and you like get a whole
[00:56:57.440] 所以你需要在纳税申报表中申报这一点，然后你会得到一笔全额退税。
[00:57:01.600]  piece of paper for it or whatever
[00:57:01.600] 一张纸之类的东西
[00:57:03.360]  And I was like my mom so my mom kept on badgering me about it and I was like
[00:57:03.360] 我跟我妈很像，所以我妈一直唠叨我这件事，我就……
[00:57:07.680]  I don't have that like what it like I
[00:57:07.680] 我没有那种感觉，就像……
[00:57:11.360]  Company has never told me that they sold anything to me like when it vests for me
[00:57:11.360] 公司从未告诉我他们卖给我的任何东西何时生效，比如什么时候归我所有。
[00:57:15.280]  It just vests. It's just like sitting there. Like I haven't sold anything. I haven't touched it
[00:57:15.280] 它就这么放在那里，就像没动过一样。就好像我什么都没卖出去，也没碰过它。
[00:57:20.080]  She's like, yeah, but you still need a pilot on your taxes the whole block
[00:57:20.080] 她就说，是啊，但你整个街区的税单上还是需要个飞行员。
[00:57:23.520]  So then I finally had to go and like google a ton of stuff and and then finally I found
[00:57:23.520] 所以最后我不得不上网搜索一大堆东西，最后才找到。
[00:57:30.640]  Where it like tells you that your stocks can vest in multiple different ways
[00:57:30.640] 它告诉你，你的股票可以通过多种不同的方式归属。
[00:57:35.840]  Like sometimes companies will sell part of your stock to cover for the taxes and sometimes they'll like withhold it
[00:57:35.840] 有时候公司会出售你的一部分股票来支付税款，有时候他们会选择扣留部分股票。
[00:57:41.360]  So you just don't get that portion of your stocks like number of stocks that you receive is less
[00:57:41.360] 所以你无法获得你应得的那部分股票，比如你收到的股票数量会减少。
[00:57:47.120]  To cover for the taxes and I was like, okay. Well, like this is me
[00:57:47.120] 为了支付税款，我就想，好吧。嗯，这就是我。
[00:57:52.160]  And my mom was like
[00:57:52.160] 我妈妈当时就说：
[00:57:58.080]  You're literally feeding me false information and like freaking me out like a month after I've already submitted my taxes
[00:57:58.080] 你简直是在给我提供虚假信息，而且在我提交报税表一个月后，你还在吓唬我。
[00:58:05.760]  For no reason because I I was like I checked every single possible account
[00:58:05.760] 没有任何理由，因为我感觉自己好像检查了所有可能的账户。
[00:58:10.560]  I may have related to my stocks and there is no
[00:58:10.560] 我可能与我的股票有关，而且没有
[00:58:14.880]  Form like I don't have a 1099 dash whatever whatever like it's just not there
[00:58:14.880] 表格上好像我没有1099表格之类的东西，反正就是没有。
[00:58:19.520]  And by this time it's like late March. So like any forms that I should have should be in there and there's nothing there
[00:58:19.520] 到这个时候已经是三月底了。我应该收到的所有表格都应该在那里，但现在什么都没有。
[00:58:24.560]  so I was like mother
[00:58:24.560] 所以我就跟母亲一样。
[00:58:27.680]  No, you're more educated now
[00:58:27.680] 不，你现在受教育程度更高了。
[00:58:30.480]  That's true, right
[00:58:30.480] 没错，确实如此。
[00:58:31.760]  But that is really funny. Yeah, so like be careful when you phone a mom
[00:58:31.760] 但这真的太搞笑了。是啊，所以给妈妈打电话的时候要小心点。
[00:58:35.680]  For the parent so google is still your best friend
[00:58:35.680] 对于家长来说，谷歌仍然是你最好的朋友
[00:58:39.920]  Maybe no one's running from that
[00:58:39.920] 或许没有人会逃避这一点。
[00:58:42.320]  You could still call them but fact check them. Yeah
[00:58:42.320] 你还是可以打电话问问，但要先核实一下他们说的话。是的。
[00:58:46.880]  Or just get an accountant if you can
[00:58:46.880] 或者，如果可以的话，直接找个会计师就行了。
[00:58:50.480]  Well, that was pretty fun chatting about all our adulting struggles and joys
[00:58:50.480] 聊聊我们作为成年人的种种苦乐参半的经历真是太有趣了。
