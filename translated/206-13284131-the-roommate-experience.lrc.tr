[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Vince.
[00:00:00.000] 大家好，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Jeesoo。我是Crystal。我是Vince。
[00:00:16.130] So if you recognize Vince's voice, then you might be a very long-time listener. Vince was actually on the podcast on episode 31, Accepted Med School, and now he's back today to talk about all things roommates. But before we get into the topic today, Crystal, let's hear your Gen Z word this week.
[00:00:16.130] 如果你认出Vince的声音，那你可能是一位老听众了。Vince其实在第31期节目“医学院录取”中就来过，今天他又回来和我们聊聊室友的种种。不过在正式开始今天的话题之前，Crystal，先说说你这周的Z世代关键词吧。
[00:00:36.470] All right. So this week, once again, it is a phrase, let him cook. That's the original phrase, but it can be used in any way, like let her cook, let them cook, whatever. Basically, what this phrase means is just let whoever, the person that we're talking about, let them just keep going. Continue cooking their meal, I guess, if we want to stick with the metaphor.
[00:00:36.470] 好的。这周，我们又要学习一个短语了，“让他做饭”。这是原句，但它可以随意使用，比如“让她做饭”、“让他们做饭”等等。基本上，这个短语的意思就是，就让那个人，也就是我们正在谈论的那个人，继续做下去。继续做他们的饭菜，我想，如果我们要继续用这个比喻的话。
[00:01:02.350] I guess one of the common things is maybe like if some guy is trying to flirt with a girl, his friends in the background would be like, let him cook. I guess another example that might be pretty common is like in sports. If someone is maybe making a questionable play in basketball, people would kind of be like, oh, like shit, what's happening? And then the dude scores, then everyone would be like, let him cook. I think who let him cook is if he fucked up.
[00:01:02.350] 我觉得比较常见的情况之一，比如某个男生想跟女生调情，他身边的朋友可能会说：“让他好好表现。” 另一个比较常见的例子是体育比赛。如果有人在篮球场上做了个不太光彩的动作，大家可能会想：“卧槽，这是怎么回事？” 然后他得分了，大家又会说：“让他好好表现。” 我觉得只有当他犯错的时候，大家才会让他好好表现。
[00:01:29.930] Exactly. So I guess there's like two variations of it. Let blank cook and who let blank cook. Wait, I've never heard the anti cooking aspect, I guess, of this meme. Like I've only heard hold up, let him cook or something like that. And I actually hear it somewhat frequently in real life because James and his friends say it a lot. And every time they say it, it's so funny to me. Like, I don't know what it is about the phrase, but it always makes me laugh. Yeah. You're like, you guys don't even know how to cook.
[00:01:29.930] 没错。所以我觉得这梗大概有两种说法。“让某某做饭”和“谁让某某做饭”。等等，我好像从来没听过这种反烹饪的说法。我只听过“等等，让他做饭”之类的。而且我在现实生活中也经常听到，因为詹姆斯和他的朋友们经常这么说。每次他们这么说，我都觉得特别搞笑。我也不知道为什么，但这句话总是能逗我笑。是啊，感觉就像在说，你们根本就不会做饭。
[00:01:58.810] I know. Like nobody's cooking except for my ass. How about you guys? Do you think you hear this one a lot in real life? I feel like it's starting to get pretty common recently. I feel like I see it a lot on like Twitch. It's like mainly where I see it. Definitely. In a lot of just like anything competitive, sports, gaming, it's super common to be like, fuck, who let me cook? Or, you know, people will be like, nice, let him cook to like cheer for them or egg them on.
[00:01:58.810] 我知道。好像除了我没人做饭似的。你们呢？你们觉得在现实生活中经常听到这种说法吗？我觉得最近越来越常见了。感觉在Twitch之类的直播平台上经常看到。基本上就是在那儿看到的。确实。在很多竞技类的场合，比如体育、游戏，经常会有人说：“妈的，谁让我做饭啊？”或者，你知道，有些人会说：“好啊，让他做饭吧，好给他们加油打气。”
[00:02:27.730] So definitely pretty common in those like competitive aspects. Yeah. And I guess in real life, the context of how I hear this phrase being used, sometimes, you know, when people start talking, they get kind of like lost in their thoughts. And then they kind of like lose momentum on what they were trying to say. And then they'll be like, oh, you know, and like start like stuttering or like hesitating a little bit. And then I feel like sometimes people will be like, hold up, like let him cook or something like that, which I guess isn't really as relevant to like the sports example.
[00:02:27.730] 所以，在竞技方面，这种情况确实很常见。是的。我觉得在现实生活中，我听到这句话的语境是这样的：有时候，你知道，人们开始说话的时候，会有点走神，然后就有点跟不上节奏，说话也开始结巴或者犹豫。这时，我觉得有时候人们会说：“等等，让他继续说下去”之类的，不过我觉得这跟体育方面的例子不太相关。
[00:02:57.110] But maybe it's just easier to use it that way. Yeah. Oh, my God. I actually have a really funny story about this phrase. I was at a party once. It was kind of warm to a lot of people in a small ish apartment and someone passed gas. And it was it was obvious not in the sound, but in the smell. And and someone was like, oh, my God, who let him cook?
[00:02:57.110] 但也许这样用更方便。是啊。我的天哪。我其实有个关于这个短语的特别搞笑的故事。我曾经参加过一个聚会。在一个不算大的公寓里，人很多，有点热，然后有人放了个屁。很明显，不是声音，而是味道。然后有人就说，我的天哪，谁让他做饭的？
[00:03:26.870] But like also no one knows who passed the gas. But I just thought it was so funny that someone like use that phrase at that moment. Yo, what if it was the guy who said who let him cook? Perfect rhyme. What is that rhyme from like when we were kids? Whoever smelt it, dealt it. Oh, my God. A classic. But yeah, that was like a very funny moment.
[00:03:26.870] 但也没人知道是谁放的屁。不过我觉得当时有人用那句话真是太搞笑了。哟，万一放屁的是那个问“谁让他做饭的”的人呢？押韵押得真好。我们小时候听过一句童谣叫什么来着？谁闻到谁放的。我的天哪。经典。总之，那真是个特别搞笑的瞬间。
[00:03:54.990] I guess like for me, this phrase, as Vince said, I've also seen it a lot in like Twitch gaming sports. But I've also seen it on TikTok here and there. But I have like no idea where it came from. I guess originally I thought it was from sports. But also I thought about it. I was like, OK, no one is cooking in sports. Like there's no way that the origin is from sports.
[00:03:54.990] 我觉得就像文斯说的那样，这个短语我在Twitch游戏直播和体育直播中经常看到。TikTok上也偶尔能看到。但我完全不知道它到底是从哪儿来的。一开始我以为是体育界的，但后来想想，体育界又没人会做饭，所以它肯定不是源自体育。
[00:04:23.510] So I looked it up on one of our favorite websites, knowyourmeme.com. And they say the origin of Let Him Cook is actually the rapper Lil B. He had a song back in 2010. And in that song, he had the phrase, let that boy cook. Bay Area legend. I think it even has a dance move, too. Oh, really? Yeah. You like stir a pot, basically. Is that where the Steph Curry dance comes from?
[00:04:23.510] 所以我去我们最喜欢的网站之一 knowyourmeme.com 上查了一下。他们说“Let Him Cook”的起源其实是说唱歌手 Lil B。他2010年出过一首歌，里面有一句“let that boy cook”。湾区传奇人物。我记得好像还有个舞蹈动作。哦，真的吗？对。基本上就是“stir a pot”（搅动锅底）的意思。斯蒂芬·库里的那段舞步是不是就是这么来的？
[00:04:52.390] I don't think so. But if I'm thinking of the right thing, there's the associated dance move, too. Oh, interesting. Entrenched in Bay Area lore. So we are the correct users of this slang. Yeah. That's why I actually recognize this one. It's a rare day. It says, though, that one of the first, I guess, viral usages of it was back in 2022. A Twitter user tweeted, let him cook.
[00:04:52.390] 我觉得不是。但如果我没想错的话，应该还有个相关的舞蹈动作。哦，有意思。这可是湾区传说里的老梗了。所以我们才是这句俚语的正确使用者。没错。所以我才认得它。真是难得一见。不过，据说它最早的病毒式传播版本之一可以追溯到2022年。当时有个推特用户发了条推文：“让他做饭吧。”
[00:05:22.250] There was also attached to the tweet a photo of a dude flirting with another woman while at an NBA game. So it's like, let this man riz it up. Yeah. I actually forgot how to use the word riz, but let him riz. No, that was right. The second one was wrong. The first one was right. We can edit that out. No one has to know. Let him riz. Who let GZ cook?
[00:05:22.250] 这条推文还附带了一张照片，照片里一个男的在NBA比赛现场跟另一个女的调情。所以，就好像，就让他尽情发挥吧。对啊。我其实忘了“riz”这个词怎么用了，但就让他尽情发挥吧。不，对，第二个是对的。第一个是对的。我们可以把那个删掉。没人会知道。就让他尽情发挥吧。谁让GZ来做饭了？
[00:05:50.470] GZ, you're supposed to be our Gen Z expert. Dude, I'm washed. I'm washed. Who let her cook? I'm tired of fucking cooking, okay? No, but actually, I think this is probably one of our most easily applied Gen Z words that we've talked about. And it's three whole words, which in our episode with Michelle, I said, if there's too many words, I'm not going to say it. But this is our one exception.
[00:05:50.470] GZ，你可是我们的Z世代专家啊。老兄，我累死了。我累死了。谁让她做饭的？我他妈不想做饭了，好吗？不，其实，我觉得这可能是我们讨论过的最容易理解的Z世代词汇之一。而且它足足有三个词，我在和Michelle的那期节目里说过，如果词太多，我就不说了。但这个词是个例外。
[00:06:18.430] Bringing us back to the topic of the day, which is roommates. Let's jump into this by talking about what makes a good roommate and how do you try to be a good roommate? I think I'm the perfect person to talk about roommates because over the years, I've lived in basically every iteration of a single, double, triple, and a quad. Wow. And I've done this in the dorms. I've done this in an apartment, in a studio, and now in a house.
[00:06:18.430] 让我们回到今天的主题——室友。咱们先来聊聊好室友应该具备哪些素质，以及如何才能成为一个好室友。我觉得我是最适合谈论室友这个话题的人，因为这些年来，我几乎住过所有类型的合租房：单人间、双人间、三人间和四人间。哇！而且我住过宿舍、公寓、单间，现在又住进了自己的房子。
[00:06:44.750] I've basically gone through every possible roommate experience you could ever have. And I'm only a little bit offended that the only thing special about me and is worthwhile to talk about is the fact that I live with other people. I'm also pretty good at it because I usually see other people being good roommates. And then I'm a shitty roommate. I think, like, objectively. Well, then what makes you a shitty roommate? This is one thing I realized in the apartment I moved out to after we left the dorm.
[00:06:44.750] 我基本上体验过所有你能想到的室友经历。我唯一有点不爽的是，我身上唯一值得一提的“特别之处”竟然是和别人合住。而且我在这方面还挺擅长的，因为我经常看到别人都是好室友。然后，我却成了个糟糕的室友。我客观地想，那到底是什么让你成了个糟糕的室友呢？这是我搬出宿舍后，住进新公寓时才意识到的一件事。
[00:07:14.050] So I was living with, like, a bunch of my friends. It was six of us in a three bed. So we were, like, in a setup where we had two people per room in each bedroom. I feel like a good roommate, you know, you're, like, really mindful. Like, some of what the other people in my house did was they, like, knew everyone's schedules as far as, like, when people are trying to go to sleep, when people wake up and what classes they have. And knowing, all right, let's be mindful of when they have to go to bed and not be loud later or in the mornings.
[00:07:14.050] 当时我和一群朋友合租，六个人挤在一间三居室里。我们采取的是两人一间的模式。我觉得一个好室友应该很体贴周到。我们室友们都很了解彼此的作息时间，比如什么时候睡觉，什么时候起床，以及有什么课。他们知道，要尊重每个人的作息时间，晚上或者早上不要太吵闹。
[00:07:42.790] Like, let's make sure to just try to, like, work around people's schedules so that when people have to wake up and get ready for their day, that you're not, like, hogging the space and, like, they're not being held up. They're not going to be late to things. I realized this after, like, three years. They've, like, finally told me. But I just take, like, 45 minutes in the bathroom, like, every morning just to go through my full routine. It's probably not actually 45 minutes. But it's a long fucking time. There was, like, one time where I was just complaining.
[00:07:42.790] 比如，我们得尽量配合大家的作息时间，这样当别人起床准备出门的时候，你就不会占用太多空间，也不会耽误他们。他们就不会迟到了。我大概过了三年才意识到这一点。他们终于告诉我了。但我每天早上都要在浴室里待上45分钟，才能完成我的全部洗漱流程。可能实际时间没那么长，但真的太长了。有一次我甚至为此抱怨了一番。
[00:08:12.950] Because, like, every now and then it would happen where I'd, like, go to bed. And I'd be, like, fully ready to go to bed. And the last thing I have to do is brush my teeth. And then someone would, like, go into the bathroom and, like, start taking a shower and, like, be in there for a while. This happened a few times. I'm, like, always complaining about it. And then, like, I actually brought it up to the people who were doing it. Like, shout out to Wesley, like, one of my old roommates. And then he was, like, you do know that every morning for, like, the last three years, we're late all the time.
[00:08:12.950] 因为有时候会发生这样的事：我准备睡觉了，真的，我完全准备好了，就差刷牙了。然后就有人会走进浴室，开始洗澡，而且一洗就是好一会儿。这种情况发生过好几次。我总是抱怨这件事。后来，我终于跟那些这么做的人说了。特别要感谢韦斯利，我以前的室友之一。然后他说，你知道吗，过去三年里，我们每天早上都迟到。
[00:08:41.970] Because we always have to plan around. Like, we have to wake up earlier to get into the bathroom before you. Or we just have to, like, just skip it. Because you're just in there when we're all trying to wake up and get ready for class. And, like, I had no idea. I didn't even think about it. Because, like, I was, like, go through my full, you know, like, the tour de France through the bathroom. Like, I brush my teeth. I go take a shit. I go take a shower. You know, after, like, I had no skincare routine. So I'm not really sure what happened. Like, where the time went. But, you know, things were happening.
[00:08:41.970] 因为我们总是得提前计划。比如，我们得早起才能赶在你之前用上厕所。或者干脆就不去了。因为每次我们都起床准备上课的时候，你都在里面。而且，我完全不知道。我根本就没想过。因为我当时就像在浴室里骑车一样，一口气完成所有的事情。比如，我刷牙，我拉屎，我洗澡。你知道，之后我根本没做任何护肤。所以我也不知道发生了什么。时间都去哪儿了。但是，你知道，事情一直在发生。
[00:09:10.030] Next thing you know, it's, like, 8 o'clock and everyone's late. It just never occurred to me that this was a problem. Because I would get out and there'd be nobody waiting. Like, I just always assumed that if it was a problem, someone would, like, knock or something. But everyone was too nice to, like, bring it up to me. I only found out after years later. And I was, like, oh, maybe I should, like, think more about how I'm affecting the other people in my apartment. But it was, like, too late. They just, like, suffered for years. And I had no idea. Wow. Wait, so you all shared one bathroom.
[00:09:10.030] 不知不觉就到了晚上八点，大家都迟到了。我当时根本没意识到这是个问题。因为我出门的时候根本没人等我。我一直以为，如果真有问题，肯定会有人敲门什么的。但大家都太好说话了，不好意思跟我提这件事。直到几年后我才知道。我当时就想，哦，也许我应该多想想我的行为会给室友带来什么影响。但一切都太晚了。他们就这样默默忍受了好几年。而我却一无所知。哇。等等，所以你们共用一个卫生间？
[00:09:38.530] So we had, like, we had four people. There was two bathrooms in our apartment. So there was four to, like, the smaller one. And two people used the master bathroom. We were sharing that room. I think we eventually, like, banished one person and forced them to only use the master bathroom. Just to have an even split. But in the earlier days, we did, like, a four or two. And it just, like, in practice didn't really work out that well, as I found out. Wow.
[00:09:38.530] 所以我们当时是四个人住。公寓里有两个卫生间。四个人挤在小卫生间里，两个人共用主卫生间。后来我们好像把其中一个人赶走了，强迫他只能用主卫生间，这样就公平分配了。但以前，我们四个人或者两个人住。后来我发现，实际上这样安排不太好。哇。
[00:10:03.190] That brings up a good point, though, which is, like, so much of being a good roommate is your behavior in kind of, like, shared spaces. So, like, definitely sharing a bathroom I feel like is a decently big pain point. Usually it's probably all good and fine. But it definitely isn't as easy sharing a bathroom versus, like, having your own. So coordinating around other people's schedules I think I can definitely relate to. Back in college when Crystal, myself, and Jessica and I lived together.
[00:10:03.190] 这确实引出了一个很好的观点，那就是，做一个好室友很大程度上取决于你在公共空间里的行为。比如说，我觉得共用浴室绝对是个相当棘手的问题。通常情况下可能没什么大碍，但共用浴室肯定比拥有自己的浴室要麻烦得多。所以，要配合其他人的作息时间，我肯定深有体会。想当年大学的时候，我和Crystal、Jessica一起住。
[00:10:33.130] Three people to one bathroom is not bad. But then there would be times where all of our boyfriends would be over. So it was, like, six people, one bathroom. And that was a little bit of a struggle. To be fair, it was two bathrooms but one shower. Right. But still, we were very amazed. We were, like, because no one really used the downstairs bathroom. But somehow we just, like, never collided. It was, like, we were taking numbers at the DMV. Yeah.
[00:10:33.130] 三个人共用一个卫生间不算太糟。但有时候我们所有的男朋友都会来。那就变成六个人共用一个卫生间了。那就有点儿拥挤了。说实话，虽然有两个卫生间，但只有一个淋浴间。没错。不过，我们还是觉得很神奇。因为我们平时几乎没人用楼下的卫生间。但不知怎么的，我们居然从来没碰过。感觉就像在车管所排队取号一样。是啊。
[00:11:02.470] And I'm trying to remember if we had, like, a morning shower, like, evening shower kind of schedule. Because I feel like staggering that can really help. I think I, on average, showered in the evening, possibly. But then I also slept late. And then if I did shower in the morning, I woke up late. Usually. Totally. I just remember you, Jisoo, always woke up pretty early.
[00:11:02.470] 我努力回想我们是不是有早上洗澡或者晚上洗澡之类的作息时间。因为我觉得错开时间真的很有帮助。我记得我平均好像是晚上洗澡，也可能是晚上。但我晚上也睡得很晚。如果我早上洗澡，我又会睡过头。通常都是这样。完全是这样。我只记得你，智秀，总是起得很早。
[00:11:28.530] And then for me, like, the earliest I would wake up would maybe be 8 a.m. And that was, like, really early for me. Amazing. I think the other weird thing, too, about sharing a bathroom, especially with, like, a decent number of people, is there's kind of, like, a thing about bathroom space. And I think if you have a bigger bathroom or a bigger shower, which ours, I would say, qualified as, like, slightly bigger, then it's not a big deal.
[00:11:28.530] 对我来说，最早的起床时间大概是早上八点。那对我来说真的非常早了。简直不可思议。我觉得和别人共用浴室还有个很奇怪的地方，尤其是和相当多的人一起，那就是浴室空间的大小似乎成了个问题。如果你的浴室或者淋浴间比较大，就像我们家的，我觉得算是稍微大一点，那就没什么大不了的。
[00:11:54.170] But sometimes, even in the shower, like, the tub doesn't have a ton of space to put, like, shampoo bottles and stuff. So then that gets a little crazy. I remember once I was, like, visiting a friend and then I showered in her dorm bathroom. And then on the ground, there were, like, 10 shampoo bottles, 10 conditioner bottles and 10 body wash bottles. And I was, like, dude, the shower space is, like, halved because there's so much stuff on the ground. Wow.
[00:11:54.170] 但有时候，即使是在淋浴间，浴缸的空间也有限，放不下洗发水瓶之类的东西。所以有时候就有点乱。我记得有一次我去朋友家，在她宿舍的浴室里洗澡。结果地上竟然有十瓶洗发水、十瓶护发素和十瓶沐浴露。我当时就想，天哪，淋浴间的空间都快被占了一半，因为地上堆了这么多东西。真是太夸张了。
[00:12:22.270] Because there was no, you know, storage space on the wall. So that was a little bit crazy. Wait, that's crazy. 10? Yeah. One for every day. You never know what kind of mood you're in. You need a different fragrance. Oh, I guess, like, back in the day in college, for, like, dorm situations, at least for me, I kept my shower stuff in my room. I bring, like, the little shower caddy to the bathroom. Right. But I guess that dorm was just, like, fuck it. Our shower stuff lives here now. Yeah, basically.
[00:12:22.270] 因为墙上根本没地方放东西。所以这有点疯狂。等等，这真的太疯狂了。10个？对。每天一个。你永远不知道自己心情如何。你需要不同的香水。哦，我想，就像以前在大学宿舍的时候，至少对我来说，我会把洗浴用品放在房间里。我会把那个小小的洗浴用品收纳架带到浴室。对。但我想，那时候的宿舍就是，管它呢。我们的洗浴用品现在都放在这里了。嗯，基本上就是这样。
[00:12:51.850] I was, like, wow, this is, like, a culture shock. But it kind of makes sense in a way where it's, like, you're not just sharing the bathroom or, like, usage of it. You're also sharing, like, the surface area of the bathroom pretty much. I would definitely never trust my shit in the shower and everyone's face. Because, like, when I first moved into the dorms, I didn't have shower slippers for, like, three days. I'm pretty sure I got immediate athlete's foot. Oh, my God.
[00:12:51.850] 我当时就想，哇，这简直是文化冲击。但仔细想想也挺有道理的，毕竟你不只是跟别人共用浴室，连浴室的面积都得跟别人共享。我绝对不会把我的脏东西直接放在淋浴间，让别人看到。因为，我刚搬进宿舍的时候，有三天都没拖鞋穿。我估计我立马就得了脚气。我的天哪。
[00:13:18.370] Oh, my God. Because there's just a mountain of pubes just left on the ground of the shower.
[00:13:18.370] 我的天哪。因为淋浴间的地上竟然堆积了一座小山似的阴毛。
[00:13:48.350] Oh, my God. That's so nasty. And it was even, like, it was just, you know, they were just showering and, like, they're shaving and it falls on the ground. You don't see. Like, I can never see what the fuck's happening in the shower because my eyes are horrible. So I have to blind myself every time I go in the shower because I take my glasses off. So it's like, oh, you know, you can't see it on the ground. You know what happens. But no, it was, like, presented into a mountain. So it was, like, purposely left as a message to the rest of us. Oh, my God.
[00:13:48.350] 我的天哪。太恶心了。而且，你知道，他们当时正在洗澡，刮胡子，胡子掉在地上了。你看不见。我洗澡的时候眼睛很差，根本看不清发生了什么。所以我每次洗澡都得摘掉眼镜，让自己看不见。所以，你知道，你看不见地上的胡子。你知道会发生什么。但是，不，胡子堆成了一座小山。所以，就像是故意留下来给我们其他人一个警告。我的天哪。
[00:14:14.370] Because, like, they, like, scooped it all up and put it into, you know, it's, like, a deliberate action. There's no way it's an action. Oh, my God. So, you know, that was what was happening in my dorm. And then I chose to live with those same people in our three-bed apartment. So. But why? So that's a bad roommate activity. So if your roommate is leaving cubes around, maybe that's a bad sign. I don't know. Yeah, they were trying to show dominance or something.
[00:14:14.370] 因为，他们把所有东西都捡起来，放进……你知道，这绝对是故意的。不可能是故意的。我的天哪。所以，你知道，这就是我宿舍里发生的事情。然后我竟然选择和这些人一起住在我们那套三居室的公寓里。所以。但是为什么呢？这绝对是室友的坏习惯。所以如果你的室友到处乱放积木，这可能是一个不好的信号。我不知道。是啊，他们可能是想炫耀自己的地位之类的。
[00:14:42.010] Just the sheer volume, you know, we just knew, like, you know, this is the king of the castle. Still have no idea who did it. So, you know, whoever it was. Checked everyone's, everyone's cubic mouth. Like, who has the cleanest shape? We considered it. We considered it. But we had just met each other. It was probably, like, the first week. You know, I think after a couple years, we reached that level, you know, as everyone does. But we weren't quite there yet. So by the time we were friends like that, the evidence was already gone.
[00:14:42.010] 光是那数量就够了，你知道，我们当时就知道，这才是真正的凶手。到现在也不知道是谁干的。所以，你知道，不管是谁，都检查了每个人的立方体嘴巴。就像，谁的嘴巴形状最干净？我们考虑过。我们考虑过。但我们当时才刚认识。大概是第一周吧。你知道，我觉得几年后，我们才达到那种程度，就像所有人一样。但我们当时还没到那个程度。所以等我们成为那种朋友的时候，证据已经消失了。
[00:15:12.250] See, that is so crazy to me because, you know, I know there's this whole discourse about, like, do friends always make good roommates or do roommates always make good friends? And it sounds like you and your roommates have become super good friends. Oh, not all of them. There's one guy. He knows who he is. Oh, the potential pube bandit. But yeah, I just don't know how comfortable I would feel living in a space like that after I saw something like that personally. Same.
[00:15:12.250] 你说，这对我来说太不可思议了，因为你知道，一直有这么个争论，比如，朋友是不是总能成为好室友，或者室友是不是总能成为好朋友？听起来你和你的室友们已经成了超级好朋友。哦，也不是所有人都这样。有一个家伙。他自己知道我说的是谁。哦，那个潜在的“私处大盗”。不过，是啊，我亲眼见过那种事之后，真不知道自己还能不能接受住在那样的空间里。我也是。
[00:15:39.930] I probably would have been like, dude, not these people. You would think. There was, like, so many incidents. I think by the end of the year, we were just numb to it. And it just, like, didn't even bother us anymore. Dude, so many incidents. So you're telling me that, like, things kept happening. And then at the end of the year, you were like, yeah, I would live with all these people again. Of course. Of course. That is crazy. You don't really know someone until you know what their pubes look like. I see.
[00:15:39.930] 我当时可能就会想，老兄，别跟这些人住在一起。你会这么想的。毕竟发生了那么多事。我觉得到了年底，我们都麻木了。就好像，这些事根本就没再困扰过我们了。老兄，那么多事。所以你的意思是，事情一直在发生。然后到了年底，你居然说，是啊，我愿意再跟这些人住在一起。当然了。当然了。这太疯狂了。你得先知道一个人的阴毛长什么样，才能真正了解他。我明白了。
[00:16:08.790] Because, like, it wasn't even the worst thing. I think the first three incidents we have, like, within the first month, coincidentally went PB&J. So there's pube bandit. Then there was booger bandit. So there was, like, someone who every time they were taking a shit would pick their nose and wipe boogers on the inside of the door of the bathroom. No way. And then, like, someone put up a sign that was like, hey, please stop wiping your fucking boogers on the bathroom door. And then they wiped boogers on that sign. Honestly, that was crazy.
[00:16:08.790] 因为，这还不是最糟糕的。我觉得我们遇到的前三起事件，都在第一个月之内，巧合的是，都跟花生酱果冻三明治（PB&J，可能指某种奇葩事）有关。先是“阴毛大盗”，然后是“鼻屎大盗”。就是那种人，每次拉完屎都会抠鼻子，然后把鼻屎擦在厕所门内侧。简直难以置信。然后，有人贴了个牌子，上面写着：嘿，请不要再把你们的鼻屎擦在厕所门上了。结果，他们居然把鼻屎擦在了那块牌子上。说真的，这太疯狂了。
[00:16:38.150] Oh my god. Dude, the audacity. So there was that. And I think we had a suspicion of who it was. It wasn't just our suite that used that bathroom. There was, like, two rooms out in the hallway that were bathroomless. So they had the access to our suite. So I feel like we just kind of generally blamed them for all of our problems. Just, like, you know, them. So that's why, like, I feel like I could justify it to myself. Yeah, I'll live with these people. It's all good. It was, you know, it was those guys. It was the hallway guys. You know, it wasn't my thing. They would never do that.
[00:16:38.150] 我的天哪。老兄，这也太厚颜无耻了吧。事情就是这样。我觉得我们当时就怀疑是谁干的。不只是我们套房用那个卫生间，走廊那边还有两间没有卫生间的房间。所以他们能进到我们套房里。我觉得我们当时就把所有问题都怪到他们头上了。就是，你知道，就是他们。所以，我觉得我当时可以这样安慰自己。是啊，我跟这些人住在一起。没关系。就是他们干的。就是走廊那帮人。你知道，我可受不了。他们绝对不会做这种事。
[00:17:08.130] Wait, that means you shared your bathroom with, like, potentially around 30 people. No, no. There was only, like, it was two rooms. So it was, like, four extra people. So our suite, I think, had, like, 10. And then there was, like, four extra people that would come in. So, yeah, we just blamed them for all of our problems. And then there was Jizz Bandit. So this one, I don't know if this is real or not. It's still widely debated. At least what happened for this one, it was, like, the same kind of thing. You know, like, peaceful fall day.
[00:17:08.130] 等等，那岂不是说你跟大概30个人共用一个浴室？不不不，只有两个房间，所以也就多了四个人。我们的套房里大概住了10个人，然后又多了四个人会进来。所以，我们把所有的问题都怪到他们头上。然后还有“精液大盗”的故事。这个故事，我不知道是不是真的，现在还在争论不休。至少这个故事的情节跟之前那个差不多，你知道，就是那种宁静的秋日。
[00:17:37.690] We're all sitting in our rooms, hanging out, doing homework or some shit. And all of a sudden, we just hear, like, this was the most frantic screaming that we heard. So someone is, like, terrified, making a ruckus in the bathroom. And we, like, all, you know, filter in. Because we're like, all right, what the fuck's happening this time? Like, god damn it. And I don't really know if this is real. But one guy is, like, he's basically, like, an inch away from the toilet seat. And he's just pointing at this one stain.
[00:17:37.690] 我们都坐在各自的房间里，闲聊、做作业什么的。突然，我们听到一阵凄厉的尖叫，简直是我们听过最疯狂的尖叫。有人吓坏了，在卫生间里大喊大叫。我们都赶紧走了过去，心想：这他妈又出什么事了？真是见鬼了。我都不知道这是不是真的。但有一个人，他几乎就站在马桶座圈旁边，指着一个污渍。
[00:18:06.270] And he's screaming, like, look at this shit, guys. Who did it? Who did it? Was it you? Was it you? He's, like, going up to each and every one of us. And we're like, what are you talking about, man? He's like, that's Jizz on the toilet seat. Don't ask me how I know. But looking at that stain, how that stained, that's Jizz. And, you know, like, none of us are really going to argue about it. But he was, like, going on this huge tirade about it. But allegedly, someone had left, you know, a present for everyone else on the toilet seat.
[00:18:06.270] 他大喊大叫，说：“看看这玩意儿，伙计们！谁干的？谁干的？是你吗？是你吗？”他走到我们每个人面前，质问我们：“你在说什么啊？”他说：“马桶座圈上那是精液。别问我怎么知道的，你看那污渍，那肯定是精液。”你知道，我们谁也不想跟他争论。但他却为此大发雷霆。据说，有人在马桶座圈上留下了“礼物”，算是送给大家的“礼物”。
[00:18:36.370] We actually set up a stakeout where, like, we would have, like, a rotating shift of people that would, like, kind of wait outside near the bathroom until they heard anything, like, through all hours. And then they actually heard someone in there making, like, suspicious noises and waited until to see who came out. And that's who we thought. Was the potential Jizz Bandit. But there's another, like, there's factions to it.
[00:18:36.370] 我们当时安排了人轮班蹲守，在厕所附近守候，直到听到任何动静。后来他们听到里面有人发出可疑的声音，就等着看是谁出来。我们当时就觉得，那个人很可能就是“精液大盗”。但其实这里面还有其他派系。
[00:19:05.510] Some people believe in Jizz Bandit. Some people don't think he's real, like Tana. Because one of my new roommates, he's, like, a really friendly guy. So he'll, like, take shits next to people. They'll be talking, having conversations, holding hands, you know, all the usual things. And allegedly, one time he took a shit next to Jizz Bandit. And he heard him mid-conversation making those noises. So he's like, there's no way. There's absolutely no way. Hmm. Interesting.
[00:19:05.510] 有些人相信“精液大盗”的存在。有些人不相信他真的存在，比如塔娜。因为我的一个新室友，他特别友善，所以他会在别人旁边拉屎。他们会聊天、说话、牵手，你知道的，就是那种很平常的事。据说有一次，他拉屎的时候正好在“精液大盗”旁边。他听到“精液大盗”在聊天的时候发出那种声音。所以他就说，不可能。绝对不可能。嗯。有意思。
[00:19:32.890] I don't know if he's just trying to protect his, like, his own psyche. Like, he's like, there's no way this possibly happened. Just so he can, like, preserve his, like, beautiful memories of freshman year. But we, I think for the most part, it's really just that one guy who thinks that Jizz Bandit isn't real. But the rest of us were convinced from our stakeout activities. We had a lot of weird stuff going on.
[00:19:32.890] 我不知道他是不是只是想保护自己的心理。他可能觉得这事儿不可能发生，这样他就能保留大一的美好回忆。但我觉得，基本上只有他一个人觉得“精液大盗”是假的。我们其他人都是通过蹲点监视才相信的。我们当时经历了很多怪事。
[00:19:55.010] Like, we actually made a card with, like, a gift to our, like, janitor lady who would come by and clean up our bathroom and suite. Because we felt so bad for her by the end of the year. Oh, man. That sounds like some horror stories that I don't know if I would ever recover from. Those were pretty traumatic stories. But I guess aside from the bathroom, there's kind of other, like, common spaces that people tend to share. Sharing a kitchen, for example.
[00:19:55.010] 比如，我们甚至还做了一张卡片，里面放了份礼物，送给我们的清洁阿姨，她会来打扫我们的浴室和套房。因为到了年底，我们真的觉得她太辛苦了。哎，听起来像是一些恐怖故事，我不知道自己能不能从中恢复过来。那些故事确实挺让人难受的。不过我想，除了浴室之外，还有其他一些公共空间是大家共用的，比如共用厨房。
[00:20:25.130] I think there's a lot of confusion that can come with sharing a kitchen with someone. I've seen some roommates share, like, plates and utensils and sometimes even, like, groceries and stuff. And other times people are super separated about it. So each roommate will come armed with, like, their own set of plates, own set of cups, etc. So I guess for both of you, what is kind of, like, your preferred method? And have you tried both methods, I guess? In, like, all of my situations.
[00:20:25.130] 我觉得和别人共用厨房可能会有很多误会。我见过一些室友会共用盘子、餐具，甚至有时候连食材都一起用。但也有一些室友在这方面完全分得清，每个室友都会带上自己的一套盘子、一套杯子等等。所以我想问问你们俩，你们更喜欢哪种方式？你们两种方式都尝试过吗？就我目前的情况来看。
[00:20:54.370] Except when I was living with Jessica, my girlfriend. That was, like, the only time when we shared things. Because I feel like if I was segregating our groceries in that kind of situation, that'd be a little weird. I think otherwise, we only ever really share things that make sense to share. Like butter, like eggs, bread or something. Dude, have you seen the egg prices? Just kidding. I think it's, like, normal again. But I think those are the only things that we've ever really shared.
[00:20:54.370] 除了我和女朋友杰西卡住在一起的时候。那大概是我们唯一会分享东西的时候。因为我觉得如果在这种情况下我还要把我们买的食物分开，那就有点奇怪了。我觉得平时我们只会分享一些理所当然应该分享的东西，比如黄油、鸡蛋、面包之类的。哥们儿，你见过现在的鸡蛋价格吗？开玩笑啦。我觉得现在价格又恢复正常了。但我觉得我们真正分享的东西也就只有这些了。
[00:21:21.990] Like, in my house right now, we don't share our plates and pans. We all have separate. I think it's, like, when we first all moved out from the dorms into the apartment in college, we had no basis of actual things, right? So everything that we brought in was, like, things we all bought together. So I feel like when we first did that in undergrad, we shared our plates and our utensils, and that was all fine. We actually only had, like, one singular pan. So that actually caused a lot of problems.
[00:21:21.990] 比如，我现在家里，我们不共用盘子和锅碗瓢盆。我们每个人都有自己的。我觉得这跟我们刚从宿舍搬进大学公寓那会儿的情况有关，那时候我们都没有什么固定的东西，对吧？所以我们搬进来的所有东西都是大家一起买的。我觉得我们大学刚搬进来的时候，盘子和餐具都是共用的，当时也没什么问题。我们当时可能只有一个锅。所以后来就出现了很多问题。
[00:21:50.490] Because we had, like, six of us all cooking. It's like, if you're in team, like, soaking your pan versus just washing it immediately, that was the issue. Because there'd be a lot of times where I'd want to cook, and that one singular pan was at the bottom of our sink covered by, like, all the other plates and stuff. There was a lot of times where we just didn't cook because we lived above, like, a bunch of, like, Chipotle and Subway and shit. So silver lining is there's a lot of good roommate bonding activities when you go out to get food together because you physically can't cook.
[00:21:50.490] 因为我们六个人都得做饭。比如，如果你和别人组队，比如把锅泡在水里而不是马上洗，这就是问题所在。因为很多时候我想做饭，结果发现我那唯一的锅被其他盘子和餐具盖在水槽最底下。很多时候我们干脆就不做饭了，因为我们楼上都是像Chipotle和Subway之类的快餐店。所以好处是，因为实在没法做饭，所以大家一起出去吃饭的时候，也有很多增进室友感情的好机会。
[00:22:20.610] So maybe they were doing it on purpose. I don't know. Who knows? I feel like sharing plates and utensils and stuff is fine as long as people are usually good about cleaning up after themselves. Especially because, depending on how many people you're living with, it would take up a lot of cupboard space to share if everyone had, like, their own sets. Unless it was, like, everyone had their own single plate and single bowl and, like, single fork, you know?
[00:22:20.610] 所以也许他们是故意的。我不知道。谁知道呢？我觉得只要大家都能自觉收拾干净，共用盘子、餐具之类的东西也没什么问题。尤其是考虑到，如果每个人都用自己的餐具，那会占用很多橱柜空间。除非，比如，每个人都用自己的盘子、碗和叉子，你知道吗？
[00:22:49.750] At least post-college, when I was in New York living with Obby, we shared utensils, plates, and cookware in general. But I will say that not anything against Obby, but I think just, like, in general, people probably do this too. Is if I had, like, something that was nicer, like a nice pot or, like, a nice pan, I would usually try to store it in a place that would be inconvenient for the other person to use.
[00:22:49.750] 至少大学毕业后，我和奥比在纽约合租的时候，我们共用餐具、盘子和厨具。不过我这么说并不是针对奥比，只是觉得一般来说，大家可能都会这么做。比如，如果我有比较好的厨具，像个好锅或者好平底锅之类的，我通常会把它放在别人用起来不方便的地方。
[00:23:19.550] Because it's like, oh, shoot, if this is, like, a really nice pan or pot, you don't know. Like, someone might accidentally fuck it up without realizing that it was, like, a nice thing. That's true. So I've heard of people who will either keep it in their room normally or they'll just, like, store it in a, like, a less obvious spot to reduce the possibility of getting it accidentally mixed up with the, like, just standard things.
[00:23:19.550] 因为你会想，哎呀，万一这是个特别好的锅碗瓢盆呢，谁知道呢。比如，有人可能不小心把它弄坏了，却没意识到它是个好东西。确实如此。所以我听说有些人会把它放在房间里，或者放在一个不太显眼的地方，以减少它和普通厨具混淆的可能性。
[00:23:45.990] Dude, I could totally picture you, I guess for context, Obby is super tall. I can totally picture you, like, stashing it in, like, the lowest possible cupboard, like, in the corner or something. Because, you know, he won't, like, bend down and, like, reach to get it. Actually, my tactic was, so I had this one pan that's, like, a carbon steel. So you have to oil it after every time you use it and, like, can't use too much soap on it. So what I did was I actually put it in, like, very plain sight.
[00:23:45.990] 老兄，我完全能想象你那样做，我得先说明一下，奥比个子特别高。我完全能想象你把锅藏在橱柜最底下的地方，比如角落里什么的。因为你知道，他肯定不会弯腰去拿。其实我的办法是，我有一个碳钢锅，每次用完都要涂油，而且不能用太多洗洁精。所以我把它放在了显眼的地方。
[00:24:14.850] And I was, like, oh, yeah, if you want to use this pan, you need to wash it, like, this way. And then you have to, like, use this oil on it after and make sure it dries completely. And, like, basically telling him all the complicated steps. And Obby was just, like, yeah, that sounds, like, way too complicated. I probably won't use it. And I was, like, okay, cool. Man, I'm trying to remember, like, what we actually shared.
[00:24:14.850] 然后我就说，哦，对，如果你想用这个锅，你需要这样洗。然后你还要在上面涂油，确保它完全干透。基本上就是把所有复杂的步骤都告诉他。奥比就说，是啊，听起来太复杂了。我可能不会用。我就说，好吧，行。哎，我努力回想我们当时到底说了些什么。
[00:24:39.910] Because, to be honest, I can't even remember what we shared and didn't share when we lived together in college. I have a vague memory of, like, bringing some of my own bowls and plates to school. And it was just, like, a couple of each of them. But I also have this weird memory of using, like, metal forks. And I know for sure I didn't bring any forks. So maybe, like, we shared some stuff. But I was once talking to one of my friends. And at the time, she was living with a bunch of her, like, college friends.
[00:24:39.910] 说实话，我都记不清大学合租的时候我们哪些东西是共享的，哪些是没共享的了。我隐约记得自己带了一些碗碟去学校，大概每种都带了两三个吧。但我还有个很奇怪的记忆，好像是用金属叉子吃饭的。我确定自己没带叉子。所以，也许我们共享过一些东西吧。我之前跟一个朋友聊天，当时她跟一群大学朋友合租。
[00:25:09.070] And I was, like, oh, what's it like living with, you know, all your friends, roommates and whatnot? And she said, yeah, like, I love them. You know, like, we hang out all the time. But the one thing that drives me crazy is that they never fill the Brita filter. And, you know, I guess for anyone who's never used one, Britas take really long to filter water. So, like, if you want to drink water, you have to fill it. And then you wait probably, like, three minutes or so for it to all drip down.
[00:25:09.070] 我就问她，跟你的朋友、室友什么的住在一起是什么感觉？她说，是啊，我超爱他们。我们经常一起玩。但有一件事让我很抓狂，就是他们从来不往Brita滤水器里加水。你知道，我猜没用过Brita滤水器的人都知道，它过滤水要花很长时间。所以，如果你想喝水，就得先把滤水器装满。然后你还得等个三分钟左右，等水慢慢滴下来。
[00:25:35.870] And I was, like, I can totally imagine, you know, myself being late, like, in a rush to get out, trying to fill my water bottle really quick. And then I'm just, like, standing there, like, twiddling my thumbs as the water drips through. So I was, like, that sucks. Ooh, that does suck. Yeah, I think we had that same problem in our apartment. I think we just, like, unofficially designate someone as that was their job to fill it up. Damn, that poor person.
[00:25:35.870] 我当时就想，我完全能想象自己赶时间，急着出门，拼命往水瓶里灌水。然后我就站在那里，百无聊赖地等着水滴出来。我就想，这太糟糕了。哎，真是太糟糕了。是啊，我觉得我们以前在公寓里也遇到过同样的问题。我们后来就非正式地指定了一个人负责灌水。哎，那个人真可怜。
[00:26:04.230] It was just more of, like, nobody else is doing it. And, like, I don't know who the Good Samaritan was. I can't remember. But I'm pretty sure it just fell on, like, one person to just, like, be on top of that. That's rough. Yeah. I was, like, when we moved in, we actually created, like, a schedule, a rotation of who was going to, like, clean and, like, do this and do that. We pasted it up on our wall and never touched it or looked at it or used it ever again. And we lived there for three years.
[00:26:04.230] 感觉就像，好像没人做似的。而且，我不知道那个好心人是谁。我记不起来了。但我很确定，所有的事情都落在了某个人身上，让他一个人扛下来。这太难了。是啊。我们搬进去的时候，还特意制定了一个轮值表，安排谁负责打扫卫生、做这做那。我们把它贴在墙上，然后就再也没碰过、看过、用过。我们在那里住了三年。
[00:26:30.250] I feel like those always seem like such a great idea, but they never actually work. True. But back on, like, Brita filters and stuff, one thing that me and Avi did was Avi drinks a lot of water. Me, not as much. But, like, I'm trying, right? So we actually just got one of those giant Brita filters. It's like a box, essentially. You get water from the, like, spout or whatever. So it can hold, like, a pretty good amount of water. So we just used that.
[00:26:30.250] 我觉得那些东西听起来总是很棒，但实际上从来都不管用。确实。不过话说回来，像碧然德滤水器之类的，我和艾维之前就遇到过这种情况：艾维喝很多水，我喝得不多。不过，我也在努力多喝水，对吧？所以我们就买了一个超大的碧然德滤水器。它就像个盒子，从那个出水口之类的地方出水。所以它能装不少水。我们就用它了。
[00:27:00.330] But the downside, I guess, was that filling it up took a little longer. But it wasn't all that bad. Like, everyone was pretty responsible about filling up the Brita. I guess the thing about having just one or even two roommates versus having a lot of roommates is, like, if the Brita is empty, like, I know exactly who didn't fill it. You know what I mean? That's true. Versus if it's a lot of roommates, then, you know, some people can remain in the shadows a little bit.
[00:27:00.330] 但缺点嘛，我觉得就是加水要花点时间。不过也没那么糟糕。大家都挺负责地往滤水壶里加水的。我觉得只有一个甚至两个室友跟室友很多的时候，区别就在于，如果滤水壶空了，我一眼就能看出是谁没加水。你懂我的意思吧？确实如此。但如果室友很多，有些人就可能偷偷摸摸地躲起来。
[00:27:27.190] So I guess for Vince, since you have a lot of experience living in a house with, like, a ton of people, do you feel like that was pretty true? Where maybe some chores kind of tended to fall on one person? Or just some people didn't really carry their weight in terms of chores? I think what happened was I feel like it was all one collective failing by all of us. In that undergrad apartment, we started with six people. But over time, we, like, slowly collected more people. And we ended up at eight at the very end. Oh, my God.
[00:27:27.190] 所以我想，Vince，你有很多和一大群人一起住的经验，你觉得你说的这种情况是不是也差不多？是不是有些家务活总是落在某个人身上？或者有些人根本就没尽到自己的责任？我觉得这完全是我们所有人的集体失职。我们大学时住的那间公寓，一开始是六个人。但随着时间的推移，我们慢慢地凑齐了更多的人。最后竟然有八个人。我的天哪。
[00:27:57.190] So we had, like, eight, but as, like, another layer to it, we survived, like, having a bunch of different subleasers. And then we also just had it set up where our apartment just kind of ended up being, like, home base for all of our friends. So we would just leave our door unlocked, and people would come in and out, like, any time. Like, we would have stuff happen where one of our friends would use the gym for our complex all the time. If he needed to, he would just run into our apartment and just take a shit if he had to.
[00:27:57.190] 所以，我们当时有八个人，但更复杂的是，我们靠着几个不同的转租人撑了下来。而且，我们的公寓后来就成了我们所有朋友的大本营。所以我们经常不锁门，大家随时都可以进出。比如，我们有个朋友经常用我们公寓的健身房。如果他需要，他就会直接跑到我们公寓里去拉屎。
[00:28:26.450] And just, like, things like that. So it's, like, already hard enough to identify who's causing problems with that many people living in there. But then we also just had random people filtering in and out all the time. There was, like, just enough things where you could tell, like, you know, you'd have, like, eyewitnesses. And it was basically, this will probably be disputed if any of them hear this. But I think it was, like, an equal share that everyone was causing problems.
[00:28:26.450] 诸如此类的事情。所以，要找出那么多人住在一起的究竟是谁在惹事，本来就很难。而且，还经常有人来来往往。虽然也出现了一些零散的情况，比如有人目击，但这些事总能引起人们的注意。基本上，如果有人听到这些，他们的说法可能会有争议。但我认为，每个人都或多或少地造成了一些问题。
[00:28:51.390] But, like, how it would happen, we would just slowly sink into just refuse and waste until it was kind of just the point where we were all just collectively disgusted with ourselves. And then we would band together to do, like, a full deep clean of our apartment. Interesting. Yeah, it would just have to build up until it was enough that we all felt like it was a problem. And then someone would go rally the troops. And then we would just spend, like, one weekend cleaning the shit out of our apartment.
[00:28:51.390] 但事情会是这样的：我们会慢慢地被垃圾和废物淹没，直到我们都集体对自己感到厌恶。然后我们会团结起来，对公寓进行一次彻底的大扫除。有意思。是啊，这种状况必须不断积累，直到我们都觉得问题严重到一定程度。然后就会有人去召集大家。然后我们就会花一个周末的时间，把公寓彻底打扫一遍。
[00:29:20.390] That actually sounds kind of fun. I guess not so much living in, I don't want to say filth, but living in filth for a while. But at least having, like, all of your best friends band together and, like, clean something together, I feel like sounds really rewarding and also sounds really funny. They were pretty good, like, as bonding experiences. I feel like it's, like, some of the core memories of, like, what we did beyond, like, all the things that led to our apartment getting into that state.
[00:29:20.390] 听起来其实还挺有意思的。我猜倒不是说要住在——我不想用“脏乱”这个词——而是要住在脏乱的地方一段时间。但至少能让所有最好的朋友聚在一起，一起打扫卫生，我觉得这听起来很有意义，也很有趣。这些经历很能增进彼此的感情。我觉得这会成为我们共同经历的核心记忆，而不仅仅是导致我们公寓变成那样的那些事情。
[00:29:48.190] But then also bring it back to a more normal, not really spotless kind of condition, but a little bit closer. I feel like each and every time we did the clean, it didn't get quite as clean as it used to be. Oh, no. So by the time we moved out, it was pretty bad. We got a surprising amount of our deposit back, is what I'll say. I'm just imagining maybe individuals, their rooms are, like, pretty clean and okay. And then the rest of the house is just, like, a mess.
[00:29:48.190] 但也要让它恢复到更正常的状态，不用完全一尘不染，但要更接近那种状态。我觉得每次我们打扫，都感觉没以前那么干净了。哎，真是的。所以等我们搬走的时候，情况已经很糟糕了。不过，我们拿回的押金比预想的要多得多。我猜想，也许有些人的房间还算干净整洁，但房子的其他地方就乱成一团了。
[00:30:17.070] I think that's pretty much what happened. I think all of our rooms were kind of small. So there was, like, less potential, I think, to have it be a mess. I think also just, like, living with that many people, how it was set up was nobody really wanted to stay in their room really too much. I think we were all usually outside. I mean, like, obviously, if you have to do work or if you're doing something specific and you have to be at your desk. I think a lot of times, like, everyone's doors were open.
[00:30:17.070] 我觉得事情大概就是这样。我们所有人的房间都比较小，所以房间乱的可能性也比较小。而且，人那么多，大家也都不太愿意待在房间里，大部分时间都在外面。当然，如果你要工作或者有其他事情需要待在书桌前，那肯定就得待在书桌前了。很多时候，大家的房门都是开着的。
[00:30:44.710] We would all be walking in and out or, like, hanging out together outside. So usually, if there was going to be a mess, it would be outside. Wow. I don't think I would have survived in that situation. I feel like I would hate living there. Yeah. Okay, because I think I'm also the type of person to hang out in my room more. So I guess I would basically, like, ignore the rest of the home and just beeline straight to my room.
[00:30:44.710] 我们都会进进出出，或者一起在外面闲逛。所以通常情况下，如果家里有什么乱，那肯定是在外面。哇。我觉得我肯定受不了那种环境。我感觉我会讨厌住在那里。是啊。好吧，因为我觉得我也是那种更喜欢待在自己房间里的人。所以我想我基本上会忽略家里的其他地方，直接直奔我的房间。
[00:31:14.370] And then I would probably take all of my belongings, remove it from all of the shared spaces, and just store it in my room. Because I'd be like, this place is a fucking mess. And then I probably would never use the kitchen. And I would just be like, okay, fuck it. I'm just gonna, like, buy every meal because I can't stand how, like, messed up the kitchen is. I feel like that's how I would survive in a situation where, like, the shared spaces were messy. Yeah.
[00:31:14.370] 然后我可能会把所有东西都搬走，从公共区域都搬出去，放到我的房间里。因为我会觉得，这地方简直乱成一团。然后我可能就再也不会用厨房了。我会想，算了，管他呢。我干脆每顿饭都买，因为我实在受不了厨房这么乱。我觉得如果公共区域这么乱，我大概就能这么熬过去了。嗯。
[00:31:44.450] That's so funny, though, because I'm thinking about, like, when we lived together. And I feel like that was, like, you anyway. So it might be, like, your default thing. But kind of in contrast with Vince's story, right? I think you, me, and Jessica, we all kind of like to, like, chill in our own rooms, do our own thing. We definitely hung out, but it wasn't, like, all the time. So then whenever you walked in to our living room, which is what the front door opened to, I feel like it always looked like no one lived there, kind of.
[00:31:44.450] 这真的太搞笑了，因为我在想我们以前一起住的时候。我觉得那才是你本来的样子。所以那可能算是你的习惯吧。但这跟文斯的经历有点不一样，对吧？我觉得你、我还有杰西卡，我们都喜欢待在自己的房间里，做自己的事。我们当然也会一起出去玩，但不是一直都在一起。所以每次你走进我们的客厅——也就是前门通向的那个房间——我感觉那里总是像没人住一样。
[00:32:12.770] Like, there would sometimes be, like, recycling or something piled up. But aside from that, the sofa was empty. Like, the couch was empty. And I was always very, like, spotless is how I remember it. So kind of a funny contrast. That's true. I mean, I guess this kind of brings me to ask about, especially when you're living with a lot of people, isn't it kind of awkward to, like, use shared space? Like, what if you wanted to watch TV, but then, like, someone else wanted to watch something else on TV?
[00:32:12.770] 比如，有时候会堆放一些回收物之类的东西。但除此之外，沙发是空的。真的，沙发是空的。而且我记得它一直都很干净，一尘不染。所以这对比挺有意思的。确实如此。我的意思是，这让我想到一个问题，尤其是在和很多人合住的时候，使用公共空间会不会有点尴尬？比如，如果你想看电视，但其他人想看别的节目怎么办？
[00:32:42.110] I think we, like, surprisingly didn't have that many problems with it. I think if people wanted to personally watch their own show, they would just, like, be on their own, like, computer or whatever, tablet or some shit like that. But we actually watched a lot of shows together as, like, a collective. We watched, like, all of the first season of Yu-Gi-Oh! together, which was, like, unbelievably lit, actually. I think we watched all of Iron Fist together.
[00:32:42.110] 我觉得我们在这方面出乎意料地没遇到太多问题。我觉得如果大家想自己看剧，他们完全可以用自己的电脑、平板电脑之类的设备看。但我们实际上一起看了很多剧，就像一个集体一样。我们一起看了《游戏王》第一季，那真是太精彩了。我觉得我们还一起看完了《铁拳》。
[00:33:09.570] We, like, hate-watched it because it was really rough. But I think it just worked out where a lot of our taste of what shows we like to watch all kind of synced up. It wasn't ever a problem if someone wanted, like, do their own thing or if someone was, like, planning something and they wanted to specifically use the TV or something. I don't think anyone really minded. So it could be. I could see why it'd be a problem, but it really wasn't.
[00:33:09.570] 我们当时其实是抱着“恨看”的心态看的，因为剧情真的挺糟糕的。不过我觉得最终的结果还不错，我们喜欢看的节目类型都挺合拍的。如果有人想做点自己的事情，或者有人计划做什么，想专门用电视什么的，这都不是问题。我觉得没人真的介意。所以理论上来说，这本来可能是个问题。我能理解为什么会有人觉得有问题，但实际上并没有。
[00:33:34.550] Yeah, I guess, like, that's one thing that I don't love about living with roommates is that I always feel like I'm intruding. Even if it's, like, okay, this is a shared space. Like, everyone has their right to use it. I'm always, like, okay, well, what if, like, what if my roommate wants to use the TV or something? Like, I shouldn't go use it. I'll just hide in my room and, like, do whatever I want on my laptop or whatever. I think that is a con of, like, living with roommates.
[00:33:34.550] 是啊，我觉得，跟室友合住我不喜欢的一点就是，我总觉得自己像是在打扰别人。就算我知道，这是公共空间，每个人都有使用的权利，我还是会想，万一室友想用电视什么的怎么办？我是不是不应该去用？我还是躲在自己房间里，用笔记本电脑什么的做点什么吧。我觉得这是跟室友合住的一个缺点。
[00:34:01.150] Also, sometimes it's, like, what if you want to use the TV and then your roommate is using it? Like, I would feel bad to be, like, yo, can you get the fuck out? I'm trying to watch TV right now. That's true. That actually reminds me of there was this one summer where you and Jessica were both not in town, but I was in San Diego doing, like, a summer semester or something. So that year I lived with Crystal's brother and some random.
[00:34:01.150] 还有，有时候会遇到这种情况，比如你想看电视，结果室友正在用怎么办？我不好意思直接说：“喂，你能不能出去？我正在看电视呢。”确实如此。这让我想起有一年夏天，你和杰西卡都不在城里，而我在圣地亚哥参加一个暑期课程什么的。所以那一年我和克丽丝塔尔的哥哥以及一个陌生人合住。
[00:34:27.030] Because I'm not close to Crystal's brother and I also don't know these people, like, we weren't, like, friends or anything, right? And I remember if I was hungry, I would listen to see if anyone was, like, in the kitchen using it. And then when I was sure that they weren't using it, I would go down and, like, use the kitchen. And after that, I was, like, damn. I, first of all, miss Crystal and Jessica. And second of all, like, I'm never getting random roommates ever again. And no fault to, like, your brother, of course, or, like, the strangers.
[00:34:27.030] 因为我和克丽丝塔尔的哥哥关系并不亲近，而且我也不认识这些人，我们之间根本就不是朋友什么的，对吧？我记得如果我饿了，我会先听听厨房里有没有人用。然后确定没人用之后，我才会下楼去用。之后我就想，哎。首先，我很想念克丽丝塔尔和杰西卡。其次，我以后再也不会和陌生人合租了。当然，这跟你哥哥或者那些陌生人没有任何关系。
[00:34:56.250] But it's just, like, I don't like feeling that way, you know? So I was, like, okay, maybe not. Maybe let's not do this again. Dude, I do that regularly. I'm always, like, is someone, like, out there? And then I have to, like, even, okay, in New York, like, even if it was Avi out in the kitchen or something, I'd be, like, okay, am I ready to, like, leave my room right now? Yeah, I think that happened to us at the very end.
[00:34:56.250] 但就是，你知道吗，我不喜欢那种感觉。所以我就想，好吧，也许不行。也许我们以后别再这样了。老兄，我经常这样。我总是会想，是不是有人在外面？然后我甚至得想，好吧，就算是在纽约，就算只是艾维在厨房什么的，我也会想，好吧，我现在准备好离开房间了吗？是啊，我觉得我们最后也这样了。
[00:35:21.950] I think that is, like, having, at least for us, it was, like, having randos be in the apartment that kind of made things more awkward, like, navigating. Because at the very end of that 1106 apartment, we end up getting, like, subleasers for, like, the very last summer after the end of senior year. I think we were staying through the summer before we all moved out. We had this one guy. We had two subleasers, and they were both bums. But one of them named Jesse.
[00:35:21.950] 我觉得，至少对我们来说，公寓里有陌生人住，会让事情变得更尴尬，比如，让人难以应付。因为在1106公寓的最后阶段，我们找了几个转租客，大概是高三毕业后的最后一个暑假。我想我们一直住到夏天结束才搬走。我们当时有一个男的，还有两个转租客，他们都是游手好闲的人。其中一个叫杰西。
[00:35:49.370] And no one could really figure out why he was in SD for just the summer. I think, like, he told us that he was doing classes, but he never went anywhere. So we were just all confused. Like, he moved into our apartment. And all he did was sit on our couch and use my Xbox to play 2K all day. And, like, not only that, he would drink all of our alcohol and just, like, day drink it.
[00:35:49.370] 谁也搞不明白他为什么整个夏天都待在圣地亚哥。我记得他好像跟我们说他在上课，但他哪儿也没去。我们都懵了。后来他搬进了我们的公寓，整天就窝在沙发上，用我的Xbox玩2K。不仅如此，他还把我们所有的酒都喝光了，白天就喝。
[00:36:17.070] And he wouldn't even, like, hit people up to, I don't know, drink with them or, like, do something. He would just, like, drink it during the day, like, as he was playing. He would just be sipping on, like, cocktails during the day or something. And he, like, didn't shower. The only time he left the apartment was to go use the gym and come back. And he wouldn't shower. So he just, like, pressively just built up, like, a stench on the couch. So, like, none of us really wanted to confront him. So we just left him alone to, like, do his thing.
[00:36:17.070] 他甚至都不会主动找人一起喝酒什么的。他就是白天自己喝，一边玩一边喝。他会在白天小口啜饮鸡尾酒之类的。而且他也不洗澡。他唯一离开公寓的时候就是去健身房，然后就回来。他就是不洗澡。所以，他身上的沙发就一直臭气熏天。我们都不想跟他起冲突，就让他一个人待着吧。
[00:36:44.090] Because, like, if you, like, would walk out of the bedrooms and you'd never look to the right towards the couch, you could kind of pretend he wasn't there. So that's what everyone did. But, yeah, he would just, he just locked down that entire area. Yeah. In that situation, that was the only time when we ever really had problems with, like, having to deal with people, you know, taking up your space, not being able to do what you want to do. So that was a time when everyone just ended up receding into their rooms and, like, only hanging out in there instead of going outside. That's actually wild.
[00:36:44.090] 因为，比如说，如果你走出卧室，却不往右边的沙发方向看，你就可以假装他不在那里。所以大家都这么做。但是，是的，他会把整个区域都封锁起来。没错。在那段时间里，我们唯一一次遇到问题，比如不得不处理别人占用你的空间，让你无法做自己想做的事情。所以那段时间，大家都躲回自己的房间里，只待在里面，不去外面。这真是太疯狂了。
[00:37:13.390] Did he ask for permission to use your Xbox or, like, drink the alcohol? Or was it just, like, one day you stepped out and he was on your Xbox playing 2K? I think he had moved in a little bit before. Or, like, I was, like, out of town for a while and I came back. And this was just my new reality where there was just some dude I didn't know using all of our stuff. Dang. I think he just snuck in there before everyone was really around because we were slowly filtering back in for the summer. I think when he moved in, there was only, like, one or two other people.
[00:37:13.390] 他有没有问过我是否可以用你的Xbox或者喝酒？还是说，你哪天出门，他就在你家玩2K了？我觉得他之前就搬进来了。或者，我之前出差了一段时间，回来之后就发现有个我不认识的家伙在用我们的东西。真是的。我觉得他是趁着大家还没都回来的时候偷偷溜进来的，因为我们夏天才慢慢回来。我记得他搬进来的时候，好像只有一两个人。
[00:37:43.570] I think it's, like, harder to confront someone when it's, like, a one-on-one, you know, because he was, like, kind of a big dude, you know? Like, we don't, it is what it is. You wanted to, like, 4v1 him. Yeah. But he just, like, inserted himself into that spot. And by the time we were all back in the apartment, it just felt like he had too much kind of momentum in being a bum rooted to our couch where we just couldn't beat it anymore. So we just left him alone. We're, like, you know, that's Jesse. He just, he's there.
[00:37:43.570] 我觉得一对一的时候，跟人对峙反而更难，你知道吗？因为他块头挺大的，你知道吗？我们也没办法，事情就是这样。你想四打一他，对吧？但他就那么硬挤到那儿去了。等我们都回到公寓的时候，感觉他已经气势汹汹地赖在沙发上，我们根本打不过他。所以我们就没管他了。你知道，这就是杰西，他就在那儿。
[00:38:13.190] That's his thing. And we just tried to pretend he wasn't there. The crazy thing is, he wasn't even our worst subleaser that summer. Because. Oh, no. The thing that sucks about, like, not being able to use a shared space is, you know, you can't, like, go out there and enjoy the TV, enjoy the couch in the living room. But what ended up happening with our other subleaser was he ended up, like, ruining, you know, the sacred place that is your own bedroom.
[00:38:13.190] 这就是他的习惯。我们只能假装他不存在。更离谱的是，他甚至还不是我们那年夏天最糟糕的转租客。因为……哦，不。不能使用公共空间最糟糕的地方在于，你知道，你不能出去看看电视，不能在客厅的沙发上放松。但我们另一个转租客的下场是，他竟然毁了你自己的卧室——你知道，那可是神圣的地方。
[00:38:40.890] Because we had it set up where we all had doubles and triples. So one of our other subleasers, I forget his name. He was rooming with one of our other apartment mates named Dapo. And this dude, what he ended up doing was, like, Dapo would have to go to bed really early every day. So he would just get in bed early around, like, 10 or so. But this guy, this is another bad roommate thing, is, like, what I mentioned about being mindful of other people's schedules.
[00:38:40.890] 因为我们当时安排的是双人间或三人间。我们另一个转租的室友，我忘了他的名字，他跟我们另一个叫达波的室友合住。这家伙的毛病是，达波每天都得睡得很早，大概十点左右就睡了。这又是一个糟糕的室友行为，就像我之前说的，要体谅别人的作息时间。
[00:39:11.070] So if you know your roommate has to go to bed early, probably what you shouldn't do is go in and cause a bunch of chaos and ruckus past his bedtime. You should probably do that somewhere else. But this guy, he didn't give a fuck. Like, this was, like, not really something he thought about. Because one night, our friend Dapo is trying to sleep. And this guy comes in and he brings back a Tinder date into this double. Oh, my God. And, like, Dapo's trying to sleep. And he comes in with his date.
[00:39:11.070] 所以，如果你知道室友要早睡，那你最好别在他睡觉时间之后还进去闹腾。你应该去别的地方闹。但这家伙根本不在乎。他好像根本没想过这些。因为有一天晚上，我们的朋友达波正准备睡觉，结果这家伙带着他的Tinder约会对象进了双人间。我的天哪！达波正想睡觉，他居然带着约会对象进来了。
[00:39:40.210] And he, like, looks over and sees him trying to sleep. And this just doesn't bother him at all. He's, like, all good. Not an issue. Because he's just, like, you know, the four or five feet between our bed, I think, is enough to make this kind of, like, a nice and separated space. This is enough where I can just take my date and we can just start banging and it's all good. Because that's what he does. And it's a pretty small room. And the window is closed, too.
[00:39:40.210] 他瞥了一眼，看到他正试图睡觉。但这丝毫没有影响到他。他完全没事，一点也不觉得有什么问题。因为你知道，我们床之间大概只有四五英尺的距离，我觉得这足以形成一个舒适的独立空间。这样我就可以直接带我的约会对象过来，然后我们就可以开始啪啪啪了，一切都没问题。因为他就是这么做的。而且房间很小，窗户也关着。
[00:40:09.030] So I was in there trying to sleep. And all of a sudden, there's a ton of noise. A lot of stuff happening. And it gets, like, hot and, like, steamy in there. It's, like, a really small room. Oh, my God. And he's, like, too nice to confront him. So he doesn't say anything. He just pretends like he's still asleep. Oh, no. And just tries to, like, pretend that this is all a dream. I'm having a nightmare. Let's just, you know, ride it out. Go to sleep. But it just keeps going. He just can't ignore it anymore.
[00:40:09.030] 我当时在里面想睡觉。突然，里面吵得要命。各种事情乱成一团。而且房间里又热又闷。房间真的很小。我的天哪。他太好说话了，不好意思跟他理论。所以他什么也没说。就装作还在睡觉。哦，不。就想假装这一切都是梦。我做了个噩梦。咱们就顺其自然吧。睡觉。但那声音一直没停。他再也无法忽视了。
[00:40:37.470] But he's still not really willing to go and, like, say something. So all he does, he, like, reaches above his bed. This is, like, the far wall. His bed is up against the window. And he just cracks it. So he can get a little, he can just get a little fresh air. And he can breathe. And then, like, hopefully that's enough. You know, the cool night air is enough to make him believe that, you know, things are good and happy again. And he's, like, okay, all right. I can live through this. It's just one more night. And he tries to go back to sleep.
[00:40:37.470] 但他还是不太愿意开口说话。所以他只是把手伸到床边，那是靠着窗户的墙。他把窗户打开一条缝，好让新鲜空气透进来，让他能呼吸一下。然后，他心想，希望这样就够了。凉爽的夜风足以让他相信，一切都会好起来，一切都会再次变得美好。他心想，好吧，没事了。我可以熬过去。就再熬一晚而已。然后他试着重新入睡。
[00:41:05.550] But then the other dude, he sees this happen. And he, like, stops what he's doing. He gets up. He's fully naked. He walks over to his bed, reaches over his bed, and closes the window. Oh, my God. While, like, teabagging, basically. And then he walks back to his bed. And these are all, these beds are, like, three feet apart. And then he just proceeds. What the fuck? Wait, okay, I'm just shocked that this girl was down.
[00:41:05.550] 但另一个家伙看到了这一切。他停下了手里的事，站了起来。他一丝不挂。他走到床边，伸手越过床沿，关上了窗户。我的天哪。他当时基本上就是在做那种事。然后他又走回自己的床边。这些床之间大概只有三英尺的距离。然后他就继续了。这他妈到底是怎么回事？等等，好吧，我只是震惊于那个女孩居然会这么做。
[00:41:36.850] Like, there's another fucking person in the room. It was a dark room. I don't know. You know, we can't make any judgments. But long story short, Dapo moved out, like, as soon as he possibly could. And then he got a new subleaser to claim his spot. And it was actually Jesse, the bum on our couch. Oh, my God. Dude, that's why he claimed the couch. Yeah. Because the room was stained already. When you have randoms as roommates, you know, things get really bad.
[00:41:36.850] 房间里居然还有另一个人。房间很黑。我也不知道。你知道，我们不能妄下结论。总之，达波一有机会就搬走了。然后他找了个新租客接替他的位置。结果竟然是杰西，那个赖在我们沙发上的流浪汉。我的天哪。哥们儿，难怪他要霸占沙发。是啊。因为房间本来就脏兮兮的。你知道，跟陌生人合租，事情就会变得很糟糕。
[00:42:06.190] So, really, just make sure you live with people that you can trust. Or people that you can beat in a fight. And this was during college, right? Just to clarify. Yeah. This was, like, in our senior year. So, this was, like, the very end of when we all lived together. So, it ended in infamy. It was, like, really, it was a lot easier to move out when we all hated being. Yeah. That's crazy. I'm sorry, but I just can't get over this story. Because I'm just trying to think what I would have done in Dapo's situation.
[00:42:06.190] 所以，真的，一定要确保你和那些你能信任的人住在一起。或者至少是那些你能打赢的人。这事发生在大学期间，对吧？我再确认一下。是的。这大概是我们大四的时候。所以，这差不多是我们所有人一起住的最后阶段了。结果闹得人尽皆知。说真的，当我们都厌倦了住在一起的时候，搬出去反而容易得多。是啊。太疯狂了。抱歉，我就是忘不了这件事。因为我一直在想，如果我是达波，我会怎么做。
[00:42:34.190] Like, I don't know if I could have sat there. But it's, like, what else would you do? I guess maybe I could have, like, walked out of the room or something. Yeah. I was kind of thinking if it really got to the point, I'd probably just be like, I'm sorry. I have to go. I think the moment there was, like, a hint of odor, I would, like, get up and walk out. Dude. I think opening the window was a good idea. But I probably would have then jumped out. Yeah. Dude, college is crazy. The things we would go through.
[00:42:34.190] 我不知道我能不能继续坐在那儿。但话说回来，还能怎么办呢？我想我或许可以走出房间什么的。是啊。我当时就在想，如果真到了那种地步，我大概会说，对不起，我得走了。我觉得只要闻到一点点味道，我就会站起来走出去。哥们儿。我觉得开窗是个好主意。但我可能之后会跳出去。是啊。哥们儿，大学生活真是疯狂。我们经历了那么多事。
[00:43:04.510] Would you now ever sleep in a double or triple or, like, more? Absolutely not. I don't know what level of desperation I'd have to be in to live in a double again. I just... I feel like, you know, after I moved out, that's when I moved into a studio with Jessica. And, like, we had, like, our own private space. I feel like I kind of realized. I was like, whoa, this is kind of nice. Because, like, you know, no hate on my old roommates. Great guys.
[00:43:04.510] 你现在还会再睡双人间、三人间，或者更多人间吗？绝对不会。我不知道自己得有多绝望才会再住双人间。我只是……你知道，自从我搬出去之后，我和杰西卡一起搬进了一间单间公寓。然后，我们就有了自己的私人空间。我感觉我好像意识到，哇，这感觉真好。因为，你知道，我并不是讨厌我以前的室友。他们人很好。
[00:43:33.410] But it is pretty nice just being able to have your own space that's, like, private. And you just have... Everything is how you want it. And nobody's messing it up. Or, like, you know, fucking while you're trying to sleep. Whoa. Technically, you're in a double still. That's true. I was going to say, like, after... I was in a triple my freshman year in college. Every year after that, I was in a single. But as soon as I graduated college, pretty much, I moved in with James.
[00:43:33.410] 但能拥有自己的私人空间真的很棒。一切都如你所愿，没人会打扰你。或者，你知道的，在你睡觉的时候做爱。哇哦。严格来说，你现在住的还是双人间。没错。我本来想说，比如，大学一年级的时候我住的是三人间。之后每年我都住单人间。但大学毕业后，我几乎立刻就搬去和詹姆斯一起住了。
[00:44:02.690] And I lost the privilege of being in a single. Because even if that's your man, that's a whole ass double, dude. It's not the same. Well, I mean, right now, I'm still in a single. Until, like, next year, probably, when we move back in together after, like, I graduate and all that. I think when we're living together, it is a double. But I think it's more of an issue for Jessica versus me. Because, like, the kind of theme of me as a roommate is, like, I just do my thing.
[00:44:02.690] 我失去了独居的特权。因为就算那是你的男朋友，那也是双人间，老兄。感觉不一样。嗯，我的意思是，现在我还是独居。大概要等到明年，等我毕业什么的，我们再搬回去住。我觉得我们住在一起的时候，就是双人间了。但我认为这更多的是杰西卡的问题，而不是我的。因为我作为室友的风格就是，我只管自己过。
[00:44:32.130] Other people suffer the consequences. So... Oh, God. I feel like I just knock out. I just kind of roll around or do whatever, sweat everywhere. And Jessica's just, like, suffering. But then I just... I'm a super deep sleeper. So I have, like, no idea what's going on. So... Not so bad for me. You know? All good. Dude, I've actually never had a long-term roommate. Because in college, from the beginning, I always had a single.
[00:44:32.130] 其他人要承担后果。所以……哦，天哪。我感觉自己直接就晕过去了。我就在地上翻来覆去，浑身是汗。杰西卡就惨了。但我……我睡得特别沉。所以我完全不知道发生了什么。所以……对我来说还好。你知道吗？一切都好。老兄，我其实从来没有过长期室友。因为从大学一开始，我就一直住单人间。
[00:44:58.770] And it was actually one of my greatest fears to have a double or more in college. Like, going into it. I think it's a thing where, like, once you have a single, you can't go back. True. Like, you can start in hell in, like, the triples and quads. And you're like, oh, hey, this is just how it's always been. And then you go and you, like, you know, achieve Valhalla in a single. And you're like, I could never go back. That's so true.
[00:44:58.770] 其实，大学时我最害怕的事情之一就是跳双跳或更多跳。就像，一开始那样。我觉得一旦你跳出了单跳，就回不去了。真的。就像，你可以从三跳、四周跳之类的地狱级难度开始。你会想，哦，嘿，一直以来都是这样。然后你跳出了单跳，达到了巅峰。你会想，我再也回不去了。这话太对了。
[00:45:23.810] And I think one of the biggest things for me about being in, like, I guess, my current double. So, like, me and James. Is most things are okay. Like, seriously, most things are fine. Like, if you like listening to your music in your room, then you can put on AirPods. Like, if you like watching TV, you just watch it on your iPad instead of the TV, etc., etc. But the biggest thing to me that I had to get adjusted to was lighting. Because, like, if one person doesn't want to have the light on but you do,
[00:45:23.810] 我觉得对我来说，住在现在这个“分身”里最大的好处之一，就是我和詹姆斯住在一起，大部分事情都挺好的。真的，大部分事情都挺好的。比如，如果你喜欢在房间里听音乐，你可以戴上AirPods。如果你喜欢看电视，你可以用iPad看，而不是在电视上看，等等等等。但我最需要适应的是灯光。因为，如果一个人不想开灯，而你想开，
[00:45:51.150] then I feel like usually it defers to the person who doesn't want the light on. For the longest time, I could only fall asleep with, like, a nightlight on. And not even just, like, the plug-in ones. Like, I would need, like, a lamp on to sleep. That was, like, one of the biggest adjustments for me. Like, living with James. Where I was like, okay, now I have to learn how to, like, sleep in utter and complete darkness. Just alone with my thoughts. So... Hey, man. James was there, too. You're alone with your thoughts? Oh, yeah. You're right.
[00:45:51.150] 我觉得通常情况下，谁不想开灯谁就得听谁的。很长一段时间，我只能开着夜灯才能睡着。而且不是那种插电的夜灯，我需要开着台灯才能睡着。这算是我人生中最大的挑战之一。尤其是和詹姆斯住在一起的时候。我当时就想，好吧，现在我得学会如何在完全黑暗的环境下睡觉。只有我自己的思绪。所以……嘿，伙计。詹姆斯也在。你一个人，只有你的思绪？哦，是的。你说得对。
[00:46:20.030] Alone with my thoughts and James. Which one is worse? The shitty thing for James is I snore kind of loudly. So, dare I say even trade-off? It's okay. He can always get earplugs for snoring. But, like... True. Light? You can't fake light. Right? That's true. That's facts.
[00:46:20.030] 独自一人，和詹姆斯一起胡思乱想。哪个更糟？对詹姆斯来说，糟糕的是我打鼾声有点大。所以，我敢说这算是扯平了吗？还行吧。他总可以戴耳塞来隔绝鼾声。但是，真的……光线？光线是装不出来的，对吧？没错，这是事实。
[00:46:48.290] Alright, so I have a final question for you both. What is something that you miss about having a roommate? Or, for Crystal's case, a housemate? I think one good thing about having a roommate slash housemate is that if, like, you need help, they're usually... They're available to help. So, I guess one example that I can think of is one time me and Avi got sick.
[00:46:48.290] 好了，我最后一个问题想问问你们俩。你们怀念和室友一起住的日子吗？或者像Crystal那样，怀念和合租室友一起住的日子？我觉得和室友一起住的好处之一就是，如果你需要帮忙，他们通常……他们都会乐意帮忙。举个例子，有一次我和Avi都生病了。
[00:47:15.270] I think, like, Avi got sick first and then I caught it either from him or just, like, from someone else after. And so, at first Avi was dying, but I actually wasn't... I was, like, out of town, but then I was dying later and then Avi was like, yo, do you need me to, like, pick up medicine for you? Which is very helpful. Because if I were alone, I would have a harder time. That's true. This is, like, one of the biggest things about having roommates and housemates. Because I feel like you have, like, this connection with people that you don't really
[00:47:15.270] 我觉得，好像是Avi先病的，然后我才被传染，可能是从他那儿传染的，也可能是后来从别人那儿传染的。所以，一开始Avi病得很重，但我其实还好……我当时不在城里，但后来我也病得很重，Avi就问我：“嘿，要不要我帮你拿点药？” 这真的很有帮助。因为如果我一个人，我会更难熬。确实如此。这大概就是和室友合住最大的好处之一吧。因为我觉得你会和别人建立起一种你平时不会和别人建立的联系。
[00:47:43.050] get otherwise with, like, just regular friends. Because you're having, like, people who are always around to, like, help you in your times of need. Like, one time what happened was, I think this was in, like, junior year or something. Like, a Friday night, late at night. And me and my, all of our roommates, we were all, like, really cool guys. So, we were sitting at home doing nothing. All of a sudden, we, like, hear this really quick knocking. It's, like, 1.30 or something. We're not really expecting anyone.
[00:47:43.050] 和普通朋友相处就完全不一样了。因为你身边总有人会在你需要的时候伸出援手。比如，有一次，大概是大三那年吧。那天是周五晚上，很晚了。我和我的室友们，我们都是很酷的男生。当时我们正待在家里无所事事。突然，我们听到一阵急促的敲门声。大概是凌晨一点半左右。我们根本没料到会有人来。
[00:48:09.750] It's, like, normal for people to come over, but it'd be kind of weird. So, we, like, go over and we look through the keyhole. And, like, all you can see. And by we, I mean, like, one of my roommates. Because I was just on the couch. And I'm on the couch throughout this entire incident. But one of my roommates walks over. And he looks through the keyhole. And all he sees is just some hair. And we don't really know what to make of that. We're, like, one of our housemates is always doing, like, really just weird, gooby things.
[00:48:09.750] 平时有人过来玩挺正常的，但感觉有点怪怪的。所以，我们就过去，从钥匙孔往里看。然后，你看，就只能看到一些头发。我说“我们”，其实是指我一个室友。因为我当时正坐在沙发上。整个过程我都坐在沙发上。我一个室友走过来，从钥匙孔往里看。他看到的只是一些头发。我们真不知道该怎么理解。我们有个室友总是做一些很奇怪、很古怪的事情。
[00:48:38.430] So, we just assumed he was up to no good. So, he's, like, oh, whatever. Like, he opens the door. It turns out it wasn't one of our housemates. It was just some random drunk frat bro. And all of a sudden, he just starts yelling, you know what you did? And he tackles my housemate, Wesley. Oh, my God. He tackles him and just, like, pile drives him all the way across the room conveniently into a beanbag chair. So, like, it was, like, not that bad. It's, like, you know, he was a nice guy at heart for a drunk frat bro.
[00:48:38.430] 所以，我们就认定他肯定没安好心。他当时就一副“哦，随便吧”的样子，然后就开了门。结果发现他不是我们室友，只是个喝醉了的陌生兄弟会成员。突然，他就开始大喊：“你知道你干了什么吗？”然后就扑倒了我的室友韦斯利。我的天哪！他把韦斯利扑倒在地，像个重锤一样把他从房间另一头狠狠地砸进了豆袋椅里。所以，其实也没那么糟。你知道，虽然他是个喝醉的兄弟会成员，但他本质上还是个好人。
[00:49:07.750] But he, like, tackles him all the way across the room and just smashes him into the beanbag chair. And, like, the good thing about having roommates is, like, when you're struggling and you need help, your roommates will be there to lift you up. And luckily, Frank was there, our other housemate, because through when all this was happening, I think I was just so shocked at how absurd this was. I just didn't do anything. I just kind of peered over the side of the couch and just looked at Wesley struggling and wrestling this guy.
[00:49:07.750] 但他竟然一把将那家伙扑倒在地，一路横穿房间，然后狠狠地把他摔在豆袋椅上。室友的好处就是，当你遇到困难需要帮助时，室友会伸出援手。幸运的是，我们的另一个室友弗兰克当时也在场，因为这一切发生的时候，我完全被眼前的景象震惊了，觉得太荒唐了。我什么也没做，只是从沙发边探出头，看着韦斯利和那家伙扭打在一起。
[00:49:37.710] And I was, like, hey, you good down there? And I didn't do anything. I just sat there. Oh, my God. Our other housemate runs out of his room because he hears all the commotion and sees Wesley struggling with this guy. And being a good roommate, he immediately springs into action and, like, grabs the guy and, like, helps and gets him off Wesley. And then he, like, lifts him away. He's, like, Frank is a pretty big dude. This guy is, like, squirming around fighting and he, like, throws him basically into this other wall to get him away from Wesley.
[00:49:37.710] 我当时就问，嘿，你没事吧？然后我就什么也没做，就坐在那儿。我的天哪！我们另一个室友听到动静，跑出房间，看到韦斯利正跟一个人扭打。他真是个好室友，立刻冲上去，一把抓住那家伙，帮他把韦斯利拉开，然后把他举了起来。弗兰克块头挺大的。那家伙拼命挣扎，弗兰克一把把他扔到另一面墙上，把他从韦斯利身边拉开。
[00:50:06.690] And he's, like, dude, you got to get out of here or I'm going to call the cops. Like, get the fuck out of here. Damn. I'm seriously going to call the cops. And in response to that, the guy just starts, like, kicking around. He, like, knocks over our vacuum and, like, the dustbin, like, falls out and just sprays trash on the floor. Which probably made us get closer to our, like, monthly cleaning. So, honestly, it was kind of a good thing. But Frank, like, is pissed. He pushes him into the wall again. Tells him, he's, like, hey, man, like, seriously, get the fuck out of here. I'm going to call the cops.
[00:50:06.690] 他当时就说，哥们儿，你得赶紧滚，不然我就报警了。滚！我去！我真的要报警了。结果那家伙就开始乱踢乱踢，把我们的吸尘器都碰倒了，垃圾桶也掉了出来，垃圾撒了一地。这大概让我们离每月一次的大扫除又近了一步。所以，说实话，这其实也算是件好事。但弗兰克气疯了，又把那家伙推到墙上，冲他吼道，嘿，哥们儿，你给我滚！我真要报警了。
[00:50:36.510] And, like, the impact of him hitting the wall was, like, enough to, like, briefly sober the guy up. Because all of a sudden, like, the film drops from his eyes and he's, like, oh, my God, where am I? Like, I'm so sorry, guys. I'm so sorry. Like, I'll leave. And then he, like, becomes drunk again. Because all of a sudden, Wesley stands up and the guy just, like, becomes unhinged with rage again. And he re-tackles Wesley into the beanbag. And, like, they start wrestling again. And, like, during this whole time, I still haven't moved.
[00:50:36.510] 然后，他撞到墙上的冲击力，好像足以让他短暂地清醒过来。因为他突然间就像是眼前的胶片掉下来了，然后他就像，我的天哪，我在哪儿？就像，对不起，伙计们，对不起。就像，我这就走。然后，他又像喝醉了一样。因为突然间，韦斯利站了起来，那家伙又像疯了一样暴跳如雷。他又把韦斯利扑倒在豆袋椅上。然后，他们又开始扭打起来。而在这整个过程中，我一直一动不动。
[00:51:05.710] I just peer over the side again. I'm like, wow, this is crazy. As a good roommate would do. And then Frank comes over and, like, picks the guy up. And, like, together they, like, carry the guy out. Like a bar bouncer. And I throw him out. And, like, he gets back up and he tries to get back inside. And then they're, like, both telling him, like, dude, who are you? Just, like, get out of here. Like, we don't want you around. And then all of a sudden, like, this dude, he has his other friend show up. It's, like, this other drunk frat bro. And he, like, grabs the guy.
[00:51:05.710] 我又往旁边看了一眼。我心想，哇，这也太疯狂了吧。就像一个好室友会做的那样。然后弗兰克走过来，一把把那家伙扶了起来。他们俩一起把他抬了出去，就像酒吧保安一样。我把他扔了出去。他爬起来，想再钻进去。然后他们俩就冲他吼，说，哥们儿，你是谁啊？赶紧滚出去。我们不想让你待在这里。然后突然，那家伙叫来了另一个朋友。好像是另一个喝醉了的兄弟会成员。他一把抓住了那家伙。
[00:51:33.870] And he's, like, dude, we're at the wrong building. Let's not this one. It's the next one over. And the guy turns. And he's, like, how can I know that I can trust you? He's, like, and, like, his friend turns to him. And he, like, stares into his eyes. He's, like, because I love you, bro. What? And then they hug. And then they just slowly walk away. And, like, the guy's, like, totally calm after that. It's one of the weirdest things that's ever happened to me. A pretty good time to have roommates.
[00:51:33.870] 然后他就说，哥们儿，我们走错楼了。别来这栋了，去隔壁那栋。然后那家伙转过身，说，我怎么知道我能信任你？他，然后，他的朋友也转过身来。他，盯着他的眼睛。他说，因为我爱你，兄弟。什么？然后他们拥抱了一下。然后他们就慢慢地走了。之后，那家伙就完全平静下来了。这是我经历过的最奇怪的事情之一。现在有室友真是太好了。
[00:52:02.810] Imagine if you had to deal with that all by yourself. That's true. Jisoo, do you have anything that could... How am I supposed to follow up that story? Mine is going to sound so stupid now. But I guess one of the things that I miss about, like, living with people is it's just so easy to, like, do stuff together.
[00:52:02.810] 想象一下如果你得独自面对这一切。确实如此。智秀，你有什么办法吗……我该怎么接下去呢？我现在说的肯定很蠢。不过，我想说的是，我怀念和别人一起生活的原因之一就是，大家可以很轻松地一起做很多事情。
[00:52:22.470] You know, if I were to run errands or, like, I had to go do something and my friend was free, then it would be, like, an easy time for us to, like, catch up and, like, hang out while still doing stuff. Whereas now I feel like I wouldn't be, like, oh, hey, I know you live 20 minutes away, but you want to go grocery shopping together. So it's just not as easy. I have really fond memories of just hangouts, I guess, being a little bit less high stakes. If you wanted to hang out, you could just gather and hang out.
[00:52:22.470] 你知道，如果我出去办事或者有事要办，而我朋友正好有空，那我们就可以趁机聊聊天、聚聚，顺便做点事。但现在，我感觉我不会再像以前那样，说“嘿，我知道你住的地方离我只有20分钟车程，但你想一起去超市买东西吗？”所以，事情没那么容易了。我真的很怀念以前那种轻松自在的聚会时光。想聚聚，就可以随时见面聊天。
[00:52:49.910] Versus now, since everyone lives, you know, far apart, it has to be intentional and kind of, like, worth everyone's drive over. I just miss the days when we would have nothing to do, so we would just watch K-pop videos in the living room all night or, like, even, like, the morning after going out, just crawling over to, like, your room or Jessica's room and being, like, I'm hungover and, like, suffering together. Yeah, good times. Well, thank you, Vince, for joining us.
[00:52:49.910] 现在不一样了，大家都住得很远，所以见面必须特意安排，而且要值得大家开车过来。我怀念以前我们没事干的时候，就整晚窝在客厅看K-pop视频，或者像宿醉后的第二天早上，爬到你或者Jessica的房间，一起吐槽，说“我宿醉了”，然后一起“受罪”。唉，美好的时光啊。对了，谢谢你，Vince，今天能来。
[00:53:17.870] It was really fun reliving some stories of having roommates and kind of just remembering the crazy things that we would do in college. I feel like there's no time, like, college in terms of, like, living with other people.
