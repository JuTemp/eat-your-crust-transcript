[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Angela. This week we have an exciting guest. Her name is Angela and she is from RealYouMandarin. So Angela, why don't you take the floor and explain what all of that is?
[00:00:00.000] 嗨，欢迎回到“吃掉你的面包皮”播客。我是Crystal，我是Jeesoo，我是Angela。这周我们请到了一位令人兴奋的嘉宾，她叫Angela，来自RealYouMandarin。那么Angela，不如你来给大家介绍一下RealYouMandarin是做什么的吧？
[00:00:28.700] Yes. Hey guys, thanks for having me on the show. I'm Angela Lin. I'm also a fellow AAPI podcaster, so maybe some of you recognize my voice. I also host the But Where You Really From podcast. But as Crystal mentioned, I founded RealYouMandarin. It's something I started last year. And essentially we offer online Mandarin courses for mainly American-born Mandarin speakers.
[00:00:28.700] 是的。大家好，感谢邀请我参加节目。我是Angela Lin。我也是一名亚裔美国人/太平洋岛民（AAPI）播客主持人，所以也许你们有些人听过我的声音。我还主持《But Where You Really From》播客。正如Crystal提到的，我创办了RealYouMandarin。这是我去年开始做的。我们主要为在美国出生的普通话使用者提供在线普通话课程。
[00:00:55.800] So people like us that are more like second generation whose parents immigrated from the motherland. So we kind of balance two or more languages but aren't fully able to express ourselves. Main point being to get people to be able to realistically express their opinions and thoughts like we can in English. So that's why the RealYou part. I think we'll talk about it in more of this episode.
[00:00:55.800] 所以像我们这样的人，更像是第二代移民，父母是从祖国移民过来的。我们虽然会说两种或多种语言，但却无法完全表达自己。我们的主要目标是让人们能够像我们用英语一样，真实地表达自己的观点和想法。这就是“RealYou”这个概念的由来。我想我们会在本期节目中继续讨论这个问题。
[00:01:21.840] But last year, essentially, I had a lot of thoughts around language and I was like, if you can't express yourself through a different language, you really are locked into like a very small portion of who you are. So that's why the RealYou Mandarin, like RealYou part, if you only can unlock, I don't know, a third of a language, you're not really expressing your real self in that language.
[00:01:21.840] 但去年，我一直在思考语言的问题，我觉得，如果你不能用另一种语言表达自己，你就只能展现自己很小的一部分。所以，这就是RealYou Mandarin的由来，就像RealYou这个部分一样，如果你只能掌握一门语言的三分之一，那你根本无法用这门语言真正地表达自己。
[00:01:47.780] And so the goal of RealYou Mandarin is to help people like us, the ones of us who speak Mandarin, but people like us be able to express more of your authentic self in Mandarin. I really like that because oftentimes we talk about, do you speak another language, whatever. And I think every time we have that conversation, I think about one, my Korean language abilities and also two, language classes I took back in high school or something where you take AP, whatever.
[00:01:47.780] 所以，RealYou Mandarin 的目标是帮助像我们这样的人——我们这些会说普通话的人——能够用普通话更真实地表达自己。我真的很喜欢这一点，因为我们经常会聊到“你会说其他语言吗？”之类的话题。每次聊到这些，我都会想到两件事：第一，我的韩语水平；第二，我高中时上的语言课，比如AP课程之类的。
[00:02:15.360] And to think about language as a form of exploring identity or expressing yourself is a little bit different from how I'm used to thinking about it. I feel like language to me is like vocab. And can you communicate with people like your grandma or like local street vendors and not so much? Can I bare my soul through this language? Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:02:15.360] 把语言看作是探索身份或表达自我的一种方式，这和我以往的理解有点不一样。我觉得语言对我来说就像词汇。你能用它和奶奶或街头小贩之类的人交流吗？我能通过语言袒露心扉吗？嗯，这很有意思。
[00:02:36.800] I think I also used to think of it that way, but I've had a lot of different experiences the past two, three years maybe that made me feel more like my personality is so limited right now because of language. So a couple different things. One is I'm married to a Spanish person whose family only speaks Spanish. I grew up learning Spanish. I think a lot of us, you know, California people, the second language, many people end up taking in school is Spanish.
[00:02:36.800] 我以前也这么想过，但过去两三年里我经历了很多不同的事情，也许正是这些经历让我感觉，语言限制了我的个性发展。原因有二。首先，我嫁给了一个西班牙人，他的家人只说西班牙语。我从小就学习西班牙语。我觉得我们很多加州人，在学校里学的第二语言往往是西班牙语。
[00:03:06.120] So I was like, oh, I know Spanish. I also minored in it in college, but it's very different from trying to have, you know, meaningful conversations with people. And so the first time I really was like, whoa, I, they don't even know who I am was when I first was like really engaging with my in-laws and they were like, wow, Angela's really quiet. And I was like, girl, I'm not quiet. I'm trying to like, I'm trying to process what you're saying.
[00:03:06.120] 所以我就想，哦，我会说西班牙语。大学的时候我还辅修过，但这和跟人进行有意义的对话完全是两回事。所以第一次真正意识到“哇，他们甚至都不认识我”的时候，是我第一次和我的公婆认真交流的时候。他们说，哇，安吉拉真安静。我就说，姑娘，我才不安静呢。我是在努力理解你刚才说的话。
[00:03:32.340] And then I'm trying to, you know, when there's like a group dynamic and multiple people are speaking, if you are still trying to translate what someone's saying, you can't even jump in in time to like engage in that conversation. So I noticed a lot of times they'd like already move on to the next topic before I thought of what to say back in Spanish. So that was like the first time for me where I was like, whoa, my personality is not coming across right now. And then the last two and a half years, we were digital nomads.
[00:03:32.340] 然后，你知道，当一群人同时说话的时候，如果你还在努力翻译别人说的话，根本来不及插话。所以我注意到很多时候，在我想好用西班牙语说什么之前，他们就已经开始聊下一个话题了。那是我第一次意识到，哇，我的个性完全没能表达出来。然后，在过去的两年半里，我们成了数字游民。
[00:04:00.560] So we were living in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. And I have varying abilities to communicate in those different languages. So that also really became apparent to me when you're trying to immerse in a society versus like, you know, your one week vacation. I think no one really cares if you can or can't speak the local language. But if you're trying to kind of live somewhere, it becomes more and more apparent of the roadblocks when you can't properly communicate something.
[00:04:00.560] 所以我们当时住在日本、韩国和台湾。我对这些语言的掌握程度不一。当你试图融入一个社会，而不是像一周假期那样短暂地体验当地语言时，这一点就显得尤为明显。我觉得在那种情况下，没人会在意你会不会说当地语言。但如果你想在一个地方长期生活，当你无法有效地沟通时，障碍就会越来越明显。
[00:04:29.020] And if you're trying to make friends, it's also kind of tough when you are so limited with your vocab. All these different things, I think, kind of bubbled up in me where I was like, oh, my God, language is so important. I didn't realize until all of these experiences. I can totally relate for being in a different country. I think that's probably a big one for me. Recently, just last year, I went to China with my mom.
[00:04:29.020] 如果你想交朋友，词汇量有限也会很困难。我觉得所有这些不同的感受，就像潮水般涌来，让我意识到，天哪，语言太重要了。直到经历了这些，我才真正明白这一点。身处异国他乡，我完全能感同身受。我想这对我来说意义重大。就在去年，我和妈妈去了中国。
[00:04:53.500] Honestly, like in a day-to-day situation here, I would consider my Mandarin like pretty passable. I can like speak to my parents for the most part, probably like 70 to 80 percent in Mandarin. But sometimes you don't realize how simplified it is until you go out. There's other people, everyone around you is speaking Chinese or whatever language. And then suddenly you're like, wait, why do I feel like extra stupid today?
[00:04:53.500] 说实话，在日常生活中，我觉得我的普通话水平还算过得去。我基本上可以和父母交流，大概能用普通话说70%到80%的内容。但有时候，你只有出门在外才会意识到普通话有多么简单。周围都是其他人，每个人都在说中文或其他语言。然后你突然就会想，等等，我今天怎么感觉自己特别笨？
[00:05:22.060] Or maybe you're like, I'm really slow today. I think the craziest part was sometimes people would say something to me and it would take a second for me to like register what they said. And in that like second of panic, I would turn to my mom and she would kind of just like re-say the exact same thing that they said. And I'm like, wait, why did it not like make sense when they said it? But in my mom's voice, suddenly I understand. Whoa, that's so interesting. I totally vibe with that.
[00:05:22.060] 或者你可能觉得，我今天反应特别慢。我觉得最奇怪的是，有时候别人跟我说话，我得过一会儿才能反应过来。就在那一瞬间的慌乱中，我会转头看向我妈，她会把他们刚才说的话原封不动地重复一遍。然后我就想，等等，他们说的时候我怎么没听懂？但是听我妈这么说，我突然就明白了。哇，这太有意思了。我完全能理解。
[00:05:49.320] I mentioned I spent time in Taiwan too and my family is from Taiwan. So I think especially if you went back to your motherland with your families, mostly, if that's like your main experience being on the motherland, you might have this false sense of fluency because you don't realize until you go by yourself, like fending for yourself, how much you rely on your family.
[00:05:49.320] 我之前也提到过我在台湾待过一段时间，而且我的家人也来自台湾。所以我觉得，特别是如果你和家人一起回过家，如果那几乎是你待在故土的主要体验，你可能会有一种虚假的“精通”感，因为只有当你独自一人，像个小大人一样生活时，你才会意识到自己有多么依赖家人。
[00:06:12.360] I had this realization as well because two years ago, maybe, or like a year and a half ago, I brought my in-laws and my husband to Taiwan. Yes, my family was there, but we were staying on like an Airbnb separate from them. And I was kind of playing host, even though I'm like, this ain't my country. Like, I don't know. I don't know where to take you or anything. So I was like the main point and the only person who could speak Mandarin. And that's when I realized like, whoa, I don't know anything.
[00:06:12.360] 我也有过类似的经历，大概两年前，或者一年半前，我带公婆和老公去了台湾。没错，我家人也在那里，但我们住在Airbnb上，和他们分开住。我当时算是招待客人，虽然心里想着，这又不是我的国家。我什么都不懂，不知道该带你们去哪儿。所以我成了主要联系人，也是唯一一个会说普通话的人。就在那时，我意识到，哇，我什么都不懂。
[00:06:39.040] And I think for me, and I say this a lot when I talk about really Mandarin stuff, but when you talked about like feeling either you speak really simplified or like you feel slower that day or whatever. For me, the way I think about it is I feel like a kid when I speak Mandarin. And a lot of that is vocab. So Jisoo earlier mentioned vocab. It is a huge part of it. I think a big part for me is that I learned Mandarin with my family growing up, speaking at home. I also went to Chinese school.
[00:06:39.040] 我觉得对我来说，这一点我经常在谈论普通话的时候提到，就像你刚才说的，感觉自己说话要么很简单，要么那天语速变慢之类的。对我来说，我感觉自己说普通话的时候就像个孩子。这很大程度上是因为词汇量。就像Jisoo之前提到的词汇量，它确实非常重要。我觉得对我来说，很大一部分原因是我从小在家里就跟家人一起说普通话，而且我还上过中文学校。
[00:07:08.820] Crystal, I don't know if they forced you to go to Chinese school, but yeah, a lot of us did that. But you only learn up to like an elementary school kids level. So if you think about it, you're like, my vocab is limited to literally a child level. And you mentioned talking to your family at home, maybe 70 to 80% in Mandarin, right? And I think that's also part of our like, we don't think about it much, but what we really speak is Chinglish or Conglish.
[00:07:08.820] Crystal，我不知道他们是不是强迫你去中文学校的，但我们很多人都去过。但你学到的也就小学水平。所以你想想，我的词汇量真的只到小学生的水平。你提到在家和家人交流时，大概有70%到80%的时间都用普通话，对吧？我觉得这也是我们平时不太在意，但实际上我们说的其实是“中式英语”或“粤式英语”的原因之一。
[00:07:36.940] If it's Korean, you know, like whatever the mix is, because our parents live here too. So they know some English at least if not fluent. And so when you don't know the vocab word, you just learn the English and they get it and you just move on. And you never learn the word because they're not like, oh, actually, this is how you would say it in the mother language. And so you never need it to build up your vocab. So for me, when I think about it, it's like, oh, I'm just a kid. Like, that's really what it comes down to is it feels like I'm a kid. Everything's just like this.
[00:07:36.940] 如果是韩语，你知道，就像其他各种语言混杂的情况一样，因为我们的父母也住在这里。所以他们至少懂一些英语，即使不是非常流利。因此，当你遇到不会的单词时，你只需要学习英语，他们就能理解，然后你们就可以继续学习了。你永远不需要学习那个单词，因为他们不会说，“哦，实际上，在母语中应该这样说。”所以你永远不需要通过学习来积累词汇量。所以对我来说，当我想到这一点时，感觉就像，哦，我只是个孩子。归根结底，感觉就像我还是个孩子。一切都像这样。
[00:08:05.660] You get what I'm saying, but it's very low level. Yeah. I think it's especially interesting because in Korean, there's also an added layer of honorifics. I think a lot of Asian languages have some layer in that, but it's a little bit more explicit with Korean where you your entire sentence structure is a little bit different when you're speaking to people who are older than you or higher status than you.
[00:08:05.660] 你明白我的意思，但这层面很浅显。是的。我觉得这特别有意思，因为韩语里还有敬语这层额外的规则。我觉得很多亚洲语言都有类似的规则，但韩语在这方面表现得更明显一些，当你和比你年长或地位更高的人说话时，你的整个句式都会有所不同。
[00:08:28.300] And I personally am so used to using that because when you talk to your Korean school teachers or to your parents or like to your family and relatives, you use the honorifics or at least I do. The challenging part for me is not going back and talking to my aunts, uncles or like grandma, grandpa. It's talking to my cousins because with people who are peers or your age, you want to have a personality. With adults, I feel like sometimes it's a little bit okay to be like a wallflower and just be polite and like sitting there.
[00:08:28.300] 我个人已经非常习惯使用敬语了，因为当你和韩国老师、父母或者家人亲戚说话时，你都会用敬语，至少我是这么做的。对我来说，比较难的不是和叔叔阿姨或者爷爷奶奶说话，而是和堂表兄弟姐妹说话。因为和同龄人说话，你会想要展现出个性。但和成年人说话，我觉得有时候像个壁花一样，礼貌地坐在那里就好。
[00:08:57.000] But with cousins, it's like I want to banter. I want to joke and be funny and like show who I am. But it's so hard when the language that I know is not really suited for like joking. I don't know how to make a pun in Korean, you know? Yo, the pun thing is so real. So we're moving to Japan end of this year. So I've been like really dedicating to learning Japanese. And I recognized my first pun two months ago. I was in Japan. Someone said a pun. They were like, do you get it?
[00:08:57.000] 但跟表兄弟姐妹们在一起的时候，我就想开玩笑，想逗他们开心，想展现真实的自己。可是我懂的语言不太适合开玩笑，所以真的很难。你知道吗？我根本不会用韩语讲双关语。哎，双关语这事儿真的太难了。我们今年年底要搬去日本。所以我最近一直在努力学日语。两个月前，我终于听懂了我的第一个双关语。当时我在日本，有人讲了个双关语，他们问我：“你听懂了吗？”
[00:09:27.020] I'm like, I do. I actually got it. But yeah, it's a whole different part of a language. When it's outside of textbook or formal language, it's really more just everyday and interpersonal. Yeah, that was actually a thought I kind of had in like recent years as well, where I was like, oh, I don't know if I'm even capable of cracking jokes, even if it's very simple in Chinese.
[00:09:27.020] 我当时就想，我懂了。我真的明白了。不过，这确实是语言的另一个方面。当它脱离教科书或正式语言时，就更多地体现在日常交流和人际交往中。嗯，这其实也是我近几年一直在想的问题，我当时想，哦，我不知道自己能不能讲笑话，哪怕是用中文讲的很简单的笑话。
[00:09:49.440] So I'm like, my parents probably just think I'm like stone cold, you know, like no humorless person just talking in these like very basic like third grade terms and stuff. To them, it's funny when I mispronounce a word or like use something incorrectly. Right. I think to a certain extent, that's why sometimes when I see my parents with their friends and they're super funny, like being a comedian, I'm just like, whoa, there's like a whole different side of you.
[00:09:49.440] 所以我觉得，我爸妈可能觉得我特别严肃，你知道，就是那种一点幽默感都没有的人，说话也像三年级小学生一样浅显易懂。在他们看来，我念错单词或者用错词的时候反而很好笑。对。我觉得在某种程度上，这就是为什么有时候我看到爸妈和他们的朋友在一起，他们特别幽默，像个喜剧演员一样，我就会想，哇，原来你们还有完全不同的一面。
[00:10:17.720] Not that they're not funny at home, but it's just the level of joke that they're able to make with their friends who are, you know, super, super fluent in Korean is different from what we can joke about as like a household. That's true. My dad laughs a lot with his friends. I'm like, where's this roaring laughter at home? Yeah, I'm like, I wonder how many jokes have just flown over our heads. And then they're like, anyone? Like, anyone? Crickets. Tough crowd.
[00:10:17.720] 倒不是说他们在家不幽默，只是他们跟那些韩语超级流利的朋友开的玩笑，跟我们这种家庭氛围下的玩笑不太一样。确实如此。我爸跟朋友在一起的时候笑声特别多。我就纳闷，家里怎么这么没笑声？是啊，我就纳闷，到底有多少笑话我们都没听懂。然后他们就问：“有人懂吗？真的有人懂吗？” 一片寂静。真是难搞。
[00:10:48.400] That actually also makes me think about, I guess, just our parents or other immigrants experiences in America as well. I immigrated here when I was four. So a lot of the tough English language learning experience, I don't really remember. Right. And it happened very young. So it's not like a traumatic memory or something that I had to like relive and even in my adulthood. But for my parents, they immigrated here in their early to mid thirties.
[00:10:48.400] 这让我不禁想起，我们的父母或其他移民在美国的经历。我四岁就移民到这里了。所以，很多艰难的英语学习经历，我其实都记不太清了。没错。而且那段时间我年纪很小。所以，这并不是什么创伤记忆，也不是我成年后需要反复经历的事情。但我的父母是在三十岁出头的时候移民到这里的。
[00:11:16.960] And I think learning to speak English in a professional capacity and in your daily life, 100% of the time is so challenging and different. I can't imagine going to Korea now, even with my current level of fluency and like really living there full time. So it just makes me have a lot of respect for my parents and other immigrants who have to do that adjustment when they're older. I completely agree. As someone who's trying to move back to Asia and not even to have my thing is called really Mandarin. I'm trying to move to Japan.
[00:11:16.960] 我觉得在工作和日常生活中，100% 的时间都用英语交流，真的非常具有挑战性，也很不一样。即使我现在英语已经很流利了，也无法想象自己去韩国生活。这让我更加敬佩我的父母和其他移民，他们年纪大了之后也需要适应新的环境。我完全同意。作为一个想搬回亚洲，甚至连普通话都说不好的人，我现在想去日本。
[00:11:45.500] So I'm like literally going to a totally different society. I had so much more respect for my parents, same as you. Once I started having to do the same, I'm like, I'm a grown adult. This is like not as easy as if you're four or five years old, you kind of absorb things a lot more easily. My parents were the same. They moved here when they were in their mid to late thirties.
[00:11:45.500] 所以，我感觉自己就像进入了一个完全不同的社会。我以前对父母更加尊敬，就像你一样。但当我开始也需要这样做的时候，我就意识到，我已经是个成年人了。这不像四五岁的时候那么容易，那时候你能更快地接受很多事情。我的父母也是如此。他们三十五六岁的时候搬到这里。
[00:12:08.420] And I think even with dating, I remember resenting my mom a little bit growing up because she kept trying to hammer into me like you need to marry a Chinese speaking boy because that's the only way it's going to work for our family. I was like, aren't you being a little dramatic? But now I'm married to someone who does not speak Chinese. And I get it because I have to translate kind of everything. My mom and dad have different levels of English, which is common.
[00:12:08.420] 我觉得就连谈恋爱这件事，我小时候也有点儿怨恨我妈，因为她总是灌输给我一个必须嫁给会说中文的男孩，因为只有这样我们家才能过得去。我当时就想，你是不是有点儿小题大做了？但现在我嫁给了一个不会说中文的人。我能理解，因为我得帮他翻译很多东西。我爸妈的英语水平也不一样，这很常见。
[00:12:35.720] I think when you move, when you're already an adult, it's not necessarily going to be the case that you both absorb language the same way. It's like my dad is much more fluent in English than my mom. She understands English better than she speaks. I think she just doesn't have confidence to like speak it out much. So then we often end up in this scenario where we're speaking in English. My mom understands what my husband says and then responds to me in Chinese. And then I have to like respond back for her.
[00:12:35.720] 我觉得当你搬家，或者你已经成年之后，你们俩吸收语言的方式未必会一样。比如，我爸爸的英语比我妈妈流利得多。我妈妈听懂英语比说得好。我觉得她只是不太自信，不敢经常说英语。所以我们经常会遇到这种情况：我们用英语交谈，我妈妈听懂了我丈夫说的话，然后她用中文回答我。之后我又得替她回答。
[00:13:05.020] So I totally get the struggle. And some people never fully feel comfortable in it after, even when, you know, they've lived here forever. Now my whole life, they've now lived here, but she still is more comfortable in Mandarin than English. So yeah, a lot of respect for moving to a different place and starting from scratch when you're well into your adult life.
[00:13:05.020] 所以我完全理解这种挣扎。有些人即使在这里生活了一辈子，也始终无法完全适应。比如，她在这里生活了一辈子，但她仍然觉得说普通话比说英语更自在。所以，我非常敬佩那些在成年后搬到另一个地方，一切从零开始的人。
[00:13:28.180] Yeah, I think I got my first taste of the translating for someone who's communicating with your family recently because my brother is dating someone who doesn't speak Mandarin. And they came to visit together a couple of times. I really started to realize it's so easy to get left behind in conversation if you're the only one who doesn't know what's happening. And I think my brother was also kind of getting used to that, too. So it was almost like we're tag teaming translating for her. I would notice sometimes he forgot.
[00:13:28.180] 是啊，我觉得我最近才第一次体会到给家人翻译的滋味，因为我哥哥在和一位不会说普通话的女士交往。他们一起来我们家玩了几次。我这才真正意识到，如果只有你一个人听不懂对方在说什么，很容易就会跟不上。我觉得我哥哥也慢慢习惯了。所以我们俩就像在轮流翻译一样。有时候我会注意到他会忘记翻译。
[00:13:57.920] So I'd jump in and let her know what happened. And then sometimes I felt really bad if everyone burst out into laughter and she's like the only one who doesn't know. And you have to like catch her up on it. Oh, by the way, this was the joke. And then like when you have to explain the joke, sometimes it's a bit like, OK, haha, that was funny. But I miss the I miss the moment. Yeah, I've been with my husband for like almost 10 years now and he is Chinese.
[00:13:57.920] 所以我会赶紧跟她解释发生了什么。有时候，如果大家都哈哈大笑，只有她不知道，我会觉得很不好意思。你得赶紧给她解释。哦，对了，这是个笑话。然后，当你不得不解释笑话的时候，有时候会有点尴尬，哈哈，好吧，这确实挺搞笑的。但我怀念那种感觉。是啊，我和我丈夫在一起快十年了，他是中国人。
[00:14:25.240] So his parents luckily speak awesome English. A lot of their family friends speak great English. But sometimes when you're just comfortable and in like a family dinner setting or something like people slip back into Mandarin, which is completely understandable. And in those moments, we've had a ton of learnings where it's like, what are the right statements to translate? What's like the best moment to translate? And I speak a little bit of Mandarin and I can understand some of it. You know, for him, he's probably trying to figure out like, oh, what does she understand?
[00:14:25.240] 所以他父母很幸运，英语说得非常好。他们很多亲朋好友的英语也很棒。但有时候，在比较轻松的场合，比如家庭聚餐之类的，人们会不自觉地用普通话交流，这完全可以理解。在这些时候，我们学到了很多，比如哪些话该翻译？什么时候翻译最合适？我会说一点普通话，也能听懂一些。你知道，对他来说，他可能在琢磨，哦，她到底听懂了什么？
[00:14:53.900] And like, what does she not understand? And this past holiday season was so funny because he would translate all the things that I did understand. And then none of the things that I didn't understand. Maybe he also didn't know it. He's like, maybe she won't notice if I don't translate these things. Like we need to sit down and go through my my curriculum so I could tell you what to translate. That is so funny. Yo, props to you for knowing some Mandarin. That's hard. It's very basic.
[00:14:53.900] 她到底哪里不懂？上个假期真是太搞笑了，他会翻译所有我能听懂的东西，却一个字都不翻译我不懂的东西。也许他自己也不知道。他觉得，如果我不翻译，她可能也不会注意到。好像我们需要坐下来好好看看我的课程，这样我才能告诉你哪些地方需要翻译。真是太搞笑了。哟，你懂点普通话，真厉害。这可不容易。其实只是很基础而已。
[00:15:25.440] What I've sometimes done, just like when I'm out traveling, is I sneakily pull out my phone and do the, you know, Google Translate where it's like, listen. And I'll just have it like real time translate. I'm like, oh, okay, I kind of got some of this. But like, it's hard. Maybe I get to translate two sentences and then I'm like, oh, shoot, I'm missing the rest of everything while I'm reading what this translation was. Yeah, it's tough. It's really tough when you're not fully capable of translating just live on the spot.
[00:15:25.440] 我有时候会这么做，就像我出门旅行的时候，我会偷偷拿出手机，用谷歌翻译，就是那种“听着”的翻译方式。然后让它实时翻译。我就会想，哦，好吧，我大概听懂了一些。但是，这真的很难。可能我只能翻译两句话，然后就会想，糟了，我一边看翻译结果一边就错过了后面的内容。是啊，这很困难。当你无法完全做到即时翻译的时候，真的很难。
[00:15:53.860] And I also think with our mother languages, our parents' mother languages, there's an element of like, Crystal, you mentioned when you were in China recently, you were kind of like, do I get what's happening? Maybe I don't. So for me, I only fully realized what was happening until I was trying to make this course. But I always feel like I say I'm fluent in Mandarin.
[00:15:53.860] 而且我觉得，就我们的母语，或者说我们父母的母语而言，其中也包含着一种因素，就像Crystal，你最近在中国的时候也提到过，你当时会想，我真的理解这里发生的一切吗？也许我并不理解。对我来说，直到我尝试制作这门课程的时候，我才真正意识到发生了什么。但我总是觉得，尽管我说我的普通话很流利。
[00:16:15.680] But when I hear people speak, a lot of times I don't actually know what they're saying because there's like so much vocab or there's like, like GC mentioned honorifics. I think in Chinese, there is also there are different levels of formality, but there's also a kind of like written versus spoken and there's like news versus like normal. So depending on the situation, I don't know what they're saying at all.
[00:16:15.680] 但是，当我听到别人说话时，很多时候我根本听不懂他们在说什么，因为词汇量太大，或者像GC提到的那样，有敬语。我觉得中文里也有不同的正式程度，而且还有书面语和口语的区别，新闻和日常用语也有区别。所以，根据不同的情况，我有时根本听不懂他们在说什么。
[00:16:38.950] But because the maybe it's like the accent or like just the tonality, I'm like, this feels so familiar to me. It's like I understand it. And then when I think about it, I'm like, no, I got none of it. I got none of that. But why do I feel like I knew it? I don't know if you guys have that feeling. But I think for a lot of people who grew up with a language, that can be this false sense of understanding that we have because it just sounds so familiar.
[00:16:38.950] 但也许是因为口音或者语调，我觉得这听起来很熟悉，好像我能听懂似的。但仔细想想，我又觉得，不，我一点儿都没听懂，一点儿都没听懂。可为什么我感觉自己好像懂呢？不知道你们有没有这种感觉。我觉得对于很多从小就接触某种语言的人来说，这种错觉可能只是因为听起来太熟悉而产生的。
[00:17:06.750] But then you're like, wait, how much of that should I really get? I've definitely had moments like that, too, where I'm like, yeah, I think I'm following along. And then it's like, oh, wait, actually, what? What did they just say? I think that especially rings true when the topics that you're discussing are more complex, right? Like if I'm talking about my day to day, like what did you do in school or like whatever? I feel like it's very much like, oh, math was hard. It was super simple vocab.
[00:17:06.750] 但你就会想，等等，我到底应该听懂多少？我也有过类似的经历，感觉自己好像听懂了，但转念一想，哦，等等，等等，他们刚才说了什么？我觉得这种感觉在讨论比较复杂的话题时尤其明显，对吧？比如，如果我聊的是日常生活，比如“你在学校都做了些什么”之类的，感觉就像是，“哦，数学好难啊。其实词汇量很简单。”
[00:17:32.670] But when you start speaking to people as like a late 20s person and they're like, what do you do for work? I'm like, how do you say analyst in Korean? Like, I don't know how to explain what revenue is in Korean. You know, it's just a little bit more challenging. And that's already like more basic, I would say. Anything like politics or government, international, current affairs, like that kind of stuff. I can't even imagine discussing in Korean. That's so true.
[00:17:32.670] 但当你跟二十七八岁的人聊天，他们问你做什么工作时，我就会想，韩语里“分析师”怎么说？我甚至不知道韩语里“收入”是什么意思。你知道，这真的有点难。而且这还算是比较基础的话题。像政治、政府、国际事务、时事之类的，我根本想象不出怎么用韩语讨论。确实如此。
[00:17:59.910] I keep asking my parents, how would you say my job like graphic designer in Chinese? And my mom was like, well, I'm going to be honest. I don't even know. I was like, dude, this is not helpful. That happens a lot. Honestly, my parents, I think they're also in a different situation than some other folks who immigrated to the US because they still spend half their time in Taiwan. They kind of split their time. So I'm like, yeah, they're super native. But a lot of times I ask them similar things.
[00:17:59.910] 我总是问我爸妈，像平面设计师这种职业，用中文怎么说？我妈就说，说实话，我也不知道。我就想，这根本没用。这种情况经常发生。说实话，我觉得我爸妈的情况跟其他移民到美国的人不太一样，因为他们现在还有一半时间待在台湾。他们算是两边都住。所以我就想，是啊，他们很懂中文。但我很多时候都会问他们类似的问题。
[00:18:29.230] They're like, I don't know. I don't know how to say that. I'm like, but you are the authority. How can you not know? And to the job thing, I have a funny story about that too. I used to work at VH1. So like MTV, Viacom, those kinds of things. And I was in marketing. So I was not on TV. But every single time my mom talked to a friend about what I did for work, they're like, oh, she's like on TV. I'm like, girl, I'm not on TV. We're behind the scenes. That's so funny.
[00:18:29.230] 他们会说，我不知道。我不知道该怎么说。我就说，但你是权威啊，你怎么可能不知道呢？说到工作，我也有个好笑的故事。我以前在VH1工作，就是MTV、维亚康姆之类的公司。我在市场部，所以没上过电视。但每次我妈跟朋友聊起我的工作，她们都会说，哦，她上电视啊。我就说，姑娘，我没上电视，我们在幕后。真是太搞笑了。
[00:18:58.210] Yeah, I think when my parents don't know, they default to like, oh, she's like an artist or something. And I'm like, wait, that's not quite. That's like, I don't really draw. Like it's pretty different. I'm terrible at drawing. Yeah. I think everyone in my family knows of my husband being in IT. He's like an engineer. And then they think I'm in finance. And I'm like, you know what? That's just close enough. It's not even worth explaining. I think it's interesting too, because computers started really getting popular
[00:18:58.210] 是啊，我觉得我爸妈不了解我的时候，就会想当然地认为，哦，她好像是个艺术家什么的。然后我就想，等等，好像不太对劲。我根本不会画画。完全不一样。我画画很糟糕。嗯。我觉得我家里人都知道我老公是做IT的。他是个工程师。然后他们就以为我是做金融的。我就想，算了，差不多吧。没必要解释了。我觉得这挺有意思的，因为电脑开始变得非常普及。
[00:19:27.610] when our parents were 20s to 30s probably. And so I feel like some of these newer jobs or like newer job functions, our parents might not even quite know. Like, do they know what UI UX is? Yeah, right? Doubt it. Also, some of those words, they only learned once they moved to the US, right? So they probably learned it in English only. I never really thought about what is that in Woe. You know, the mother's father.
[00:19:27.610] 大概在我们父母二三十岁的时候吧。所以我觉得，对于一些新兴的工作或新的工作职能，我们父母可能都不太了解。比如，他们知道UI/UX是什么吗？嗯，应该知道吧？我怀疑他们不知道。而且，有些词汇，他们也是搬到美国之后才学的，对吧？所以他们可能只学过英语。我从来没想过“Woe”是什么意思。你知道，就是“母亲的父亲”。
[00:19:57.590] So true. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like, some of these job-related words, it might be up to us to learn. And yeah, you teach them a new Korean or Chinese word. Do you ever, when you're having conversations with, maybe not your parents, because I do think when we talk to our parents, there's not a dumbing down, but there's the mix of English and the other language, right? So you were able to say what you want. But when I'm talking to my cousins, you mentioned that. Oh my gosh.
[00:19:57.590] 确实如此。是啊。是啊。所以我就想，有些跟工作相关的词汇，或许应该由我们自己去学。是啊，你教他们一个新的韩语或汉语单词。你有没有过这样的经历：当你和别人聊天的时候——也许不是和你的父母，因为我觉得我们和父母说话的时候，虽然不会刻意降低标准，但英语和其他语言会混杂在一起，对吧？所以你可以畅所欲言。但当我跟我的表兄弟姐妹聊天的时候，就像你刚才提到的那样。我的天哪。
[00:20:26.510] Every time I'm back in Taiwan, talking to my adult cousins or like peers of that nature, I just move on. If there are words they said and I did not know what they said, I just move on and pretend like I did. Because I'm like, I don't want to draw attention to the fact that I didn't understand this. Or it's not like that important to keeping the conversation flowing or I'll kill the vibe or something. So I feel like a lot of times that also impedes my own learning because I'm like, I should just ask them, like, what does that mean?
[00:20:26.510] 每次回到台湾，和我的成年表亲或者同龄人聊天时，如果他们说了什么我听不懂的话，我都会装作听懂了，然后继续往下说。因为我觉得，我不想让别人注意到我没听懂。或者觉得这跟继续聊天没太大关系，会破坏气氛什么的。所以我觉得很多时候这样反而阻碍了我自己的学习，因为我会想，我应该直接问问他们，那是什么意思？
[00:20:55.490] It shouldn't be embarrassing because they know I grew up in the US. Like, why would I know 100% of what they're saying? It's so funny that you mentioned that because I don't know if you guys remember this episode in Friends, but there's this one episode where Joey, who is like an actor, he's like, oh, I have this trick. Whenever I forget my lines, I just pretend like I'm smelling old cheese or something like that. And then he like has this face that he makes where he kind of like gazes into the distance.
[00:20:55.490] 这没什么好尴尬的，因为他们知道我是在美国长大的。我怎么可能百分百听懂他们在说什么呢？你提到这个真是太逗了，因为我不知道你们还记不记得《老友记》里的这一集，有一集里，乔伊（他是个演员）说，哦，我有个小窍门。每次我忘词的时候，我就假装闻到一股陈年奶酪的味道之类的。然后他会摆出一副凝视远方的表情。
[00:21:21.230] I feel like I must have a face like that when I don't understand a word because I was talking to my cousin recently and it was about like a very sensitive topic. We were talking about kids and, you know, preparing for pregnancy and, you know, more sensitive things like having a miscarriage and things like that. She mentioned the term miscarriage and I think I just didn't know what that term was in Korean. So I think I made that face and then she dumbed it down literally to like when you lose your baby.
[00:21:21.230] 我觉得自己听不懂别人说话的时候肯定就是这种表情，因为我最近和表妹聊天，聊的是个很敏感的话题。我们聊到孩子，还有备孕，以及一些比较私密的事情，比如流产之类的。她提到了“流产”这个词，我当时可能不知道韩语怎么说。所以我想我当时就露出了那种表情，然后她就用浅显易懂的方式解释说就是失去孩子。
[00:21:49.330] And I was just like, damn, it's crazy that she has to like explain things like that to me. Oh my God. Very simplistic language. She's like, God damn this. She's like, do I really have to spell this out? No, but I'm definitely the same. I think I give this like blank stare and I just kind of nod. I'm like, uh, yeah. And they're like, actually, that was a question. Like you're supposed to answer. Yeah, it's tough. And it's, I don't know.
[00:21:49.330] 我当时就想，天哪，她居然要跟我解释这些，真是太离谱了。我的天啊。用词非常简单。她就说，真是的。她好像在说，我真的要解释得这么清楚吗？不用，但我肯定也一样。我当时就一脸茫然，然后就点了点头。我说，呃，是啊。然后他们说，其实这是个问题。你应该回答。是啊，这很难。我也不知道。
[00:22:16.810] I think talking about sensitive topics or like more complex nuances and whatnot, like this is a lot of how you really get to know someone instead of just talking about like very surface level things. So to a certain extent, sometimes I'm like, damn, well, my cousins really know who I am on the inside. You're like, what if you guys learned English? Yeah, I feel that so much. That's actually why.
[00:22:16.810] 我觉得谈论一些敏感话题，或者更复杂的细微差别等等，才是真正了解一个人的方式，而不是只聊些肤浅的事情。所以在某种程度上，有时候我会想，哇，我的表兄弟姐妹们真的了解我内心深处。你会想，如果你们学英语会怎么样？是啊，我深有同感。这其实就是原因。
[00:22:46.930] So all the topics that we cover in Real You Mandarin are these real topics. So there is one that is around specifically the lesson is pressures around marriage and children. So there's this, I think many people have these conversations with their parents, especially when they're pre-marriage and stuff. And they're like, when are you going to get married? Like, I'm not getting any younger. We're giving you some kids already, you know, like grandkids already. But through that lesson, we also teach things like, I think miscarriage is one of our vocab
[00:22:46.930] 所以，我们在“Real You Mandarin”课程中涵盖的所有话题都是真实存在的。其中有一节课专门讲解婚姻和子女带来的压力。我想很多人都会和父母讨论这个问题，尤其是在结婚前。父母会问：“你们什么时候结婚啊？我年纪也不小了，我们都快要生孩子了，都快要抱孙子了。” 但通过这节课，我们也会教一些其他内容，比如流产，这是我们课程中的一个词汇。
[00:23:13.610] words and IVF and all the things like a lot of us are talking about already in English with our peers. But if you wanted to talk about that with your cousins or other people back in Asia, you would realize pretty quickly, like, you don't know those words. That's kind of our motivation behind the course is we want to give people this like jumpstart into knowing what it would feel like to have a realistic conversation about these types of topics.
[00:23:13.610] 词汇、试管婴儿等等，这些都是我们很多人平时用英语和同龄人谈论的话题。但如果你想和你在亚洲的表亲或其他朋友谈论这些，你很快就会意识到，你根本不知道该用什么词。这就是我们开设这门课程的初衷：我们希望帮助大家快速入门，了解如何就这类话题进行有效的沟通。
[00:23:42.010] So earlier, you also mentioned like politics and stuff. We actually made this course last year. So it was before the actual election. But like, we did make a lesson around talking about the election. And it's everything you already talk about in like normal life. But how would you do that in Mandarin? Obviously can't cover everything, right? But I do like to think it gives you confidence into starting to have those conversations with people you want to have them with.
[00:23:42.010] 刚才你也提到了政治之类的话题。我们去年就开设了这门课，也就是在大选之前。我们确实专门做了一节课来讨论选举。内容都是你在日常生活中经常会聊到的。但是用普通话怎么讲呢？显然不可能面面俱到，对吧？但我认为这门课能让你更有信心去和你想聊的人进行这些对话。
[00:24:08.090] You kind of can anticipate what someone might say in response because it is meant to be very realistic. So that's how we kind of approach that instead of like, here's just 500 vocab words for you to memorize. It's really in the context of what that conversation might actually be where you use that vocab word. I think that's pretty helpful because there are definitely moments that we've all described so far where maybe you like didn't recognize a word and then you ask, what did that mean?
[00:24:08.090] 因为这种教学方式非常贴近实际，所以你大概可以预判别人可能会怎么回答。我们采用的就是这种方式，而不是直接给你500个单词让你死记硬背。而是让你在实际的对话情境中使用这些单词。我觉得这很有帮助，因为正如我们之前提到的，确实存在一些情况，你可能不认识某个单词，然后你会问：“这是什么意思？”
[00:24:37.410] Or you kind of just like let it pass. But when that happens, it's so quick. Maybe in that one second, you're like, oh, okay, now I know what that word means. But then later, like probably the next day, you'll be like, oh, shoot, how do you say miscarriage again? Right. And so I feel like having a course to like really nail it in probably helps a lot. And I feel like it would not to say that we're just small talking with our parents, but to a certain extent, if your vocabulary is limited, I feel like that could be the
[00:24:37.410] 或者你可能就直接忽略了。但这种情况发生的时候，真的太快了。也许就在那一瞬间，你会想，哦，好吧，现在我知道这个词的意思了。但过一会儿，比如第二天，你就会想，哎呀，流产怎么说来着？没错。所以我觉得上个课好好学学这个词真的很有帮助。我觉得这并不是说我们只是在和父母闲聊，但在某种程度上，如果你的词汇量有限，我觉得这可能会……
[00:25:06.750] default path that you go down. Keep the conversation very simple and light. Just talk about things that you are comfortable talking about and then just move on with your day and keep the complex stuff for your friends. So I feel like having that base to be able to have those conversations and also at the same time putting your own effort into it, right? And not just expecting your parents to learn the English version of it. It's really cool. Yeah. Dude, this kind of reminds me though. There was a phrase that I didn't know until probably like beginning of last year.
[00:25:06.750] 默认的对话方式。保持对话简单轻松。只聊你觉得舒服的话题，然后就继续你的日常，把复杂的话题留给你的朋友。我觉得，有了这样的基础，你就能进行这些对话，同时也要付出自己的努力，对吧？而不是指望你的父母学会英语版本。这真的很棒。是啊。兄弟，这让我想起一件事。我大概直到去年年初才知道一个短语。
[00:25:36.670] And I was so shocked that I never asked or learned how to say this. It's awkward in Mandarin. And my dad was saying something one day and he was like, yeah, I was like feeling kind of awkward because like someone put me in a weird spot at work. And I was like, what does that word mean? And he's like, dude, I don't even know. So we looked it up together and we're like, oh, it means awkward. But literally like maybe two weeks later, I completely forgot the word.
[00:25:36.670] 我当时震惊极了，竟然从来没问过也没学过这个词怎么说。用普通话来说，这词挺尴尬的。有一天我爸跟我说，他当时感觉有点尴尬，因为有人在工作中让他处境尴尬。我就问他，这词是什么意思？他说，兄弟，我也不知道。于是我们一起查了一下，才知道原来是“尴尬”的意思。结果大概过了两周，我就把这个词彻底忘了。
[00:26:02.270] So I had to ask one of my friends who is much better at Chinese and they're like, oh, yeah, this is how you say awkward. And I was like, OK, I need to commit this to memory because this is like a very useful word for some reason. I have never used it, even though I do feel awkward a lot. I think it was also eye opening because I was like, oh, wait, my parents can also feel this feeling. I just never knew the phrase for it. Like how many times have they been like, oh, actually, I feel awkward from like this one interaction.
[00:26:02.270] 所以我只好去问了一个中文比我好得多的朋友，他告诉我：“哦，原来‘尴尬’是这么说的。” 我当时就想，好吧，我得记住这个词，因为不知为何它真的很有用。我以前从来没用过，尽管我经常感到尴尬。我觉得这也让我大开眼界，因为我突然意识到，哦，等等，我的父母也能感受到这种感觉。我只是以前不知道该怎么表达。他们有多少次因为这样或那样的互动而感到尴尬呢？
[00:26:29.810] And I was just like, yeah, blank stare and smile. I have two thoughts about that. One is I'm going to keep plugging my course, but that's kind of I mean, it's part of the conversation, right? So the dialogues, I think one of the reasons I wanted this to be like the base way that you learn through our courses is it's not just like watching it. I think there's only so much you can retain when you watch something. It's about doing it as well.
[00:26:29.810] 我当时就愣住了，面无表情地笑了笑。关于这件事我有两点想法。一是我会继续推广我的课程，但我觉得这也是对话的一部分，对吧？所以，对话，我认为我希望它成为我们课程学习的基础方式，原因之一就是它不仅仅是观看视频。我觉得光看视频能记住的东西是有限的，实践也很重要。
[00:26:58.290] So I only learned this technique called shadowing when I started learning Japanese. But essentially, we encourage people to play the conversation, which is role playing between me and the Mandarin teacher partner that I worked with. We want people to shadow what we say. So basically, when you play it, you're trying to mimic what we're saying at the same time that we speak so that you are getting the practice in with your own mouth, like how to
[00:26:58.290] 我学日语的时候才接触到这种叫做“跟读”的技巧。简单来说，就是鼓励大家进行角色扮演对话，也就是我和搭档汉语老师之间的对话。我们希望大家跟着我们说话。所以，当你进行角色扮演的时候，你要做的就是在我们说话的同时模仿我们，这样你就能练习用自己的口语表达，比如如何……
[00:27:26.350] say that not only the vocab that is new to you in the context of the conversation you want to have, but also the natural speed and like the tone, the type of expression you might have when you're saying those things. So that way you've already felt what it feels like to have that conversation. It'll feel more familiar to you later on when you do try to have that conversation. And also, we kind of help people try to hammer it in.
[00:27:26.350] 不仅要练习在你想进行的对话中用到的新词汇，还要练习自然的语速、语气以及表达方式。这样，你就能提前感受一下那种对话氛围。以后真正尝试进行这种对话时，你会感觉更加得心应手。而且，我们也会帮助人们反复练习，巩固这些技巧。
[00:27:51.930] I have that happen all the time where I hear a new word and I just like forget it later. I'm like, I swear I learned this two days ago, but I don't remember it. Something that I've been using for many years, I think a lot of language learners know this app as well, something called Anki. It's like a digital flashcard system. It's open source. So you can kind of just like do whatever you want with it. But for us, we pre-built Anki digital flashcards for people of the main vocab words in these lessons.
[00:27:51.930] 我经常遇到这种情况：听到一个新单词，过段时间就忘了。我明明记得两天前学过，但就是想不起来。我用过很多年了，我想很多语言学习者也都知道一个叫 Anki 的应用。它就像一个电子单词卡系统，而且是开源的。所以你可以随意使用它。不过，我们为大家预先制作了 Anki 电子单词卡，里面包含了这些课程中的主要词汇。
[00:28:19.770] And they all have the Chinese, the pinging, the English translation, a sample sentence and the audio pronunciation. And essentially what Anki does is like instead of just being paper flashcards, you just kind of like go through it, right? And you like throw it away or forget it. Anki is algorithmic. So it essentially shows you different flashcards in varying frequencies based on if you keep getting it right or wrong. So if you keep getting something wrong, it'll show you more frequently until you get it right.
[00:28:19.770] 它们都包含中文、提示音、英文翻译、例句和音频发音。Anki 的作用类似于纸质单词卡片，你用完之后可能就扔掉或者忘记了。Anki 是基于算法的。它会根据你的答题情况，以不同的频率显示不同的单词卡片。如果你一直答错，它就会更频繁地显示该单词卡片，直到你答对为止。
[00:28:47.970] And so we kind of took the legwork out of it for people. Like for me using Anki for many years now, the biggest annoyance is making the flashcards. She's like, I don't want to take the time to do it. We're like, here you go. Just download it. But we're trying to make it as easy as possible for people to get the practice in of how would I use this vocab with my own mouth? And then also the practice of the vocab with the flashcards.
[00:28:47.970] 所以我们算是帮大家省去了不少麻烦。比如我自己用Anki好多年了，最烦的就是制作单词卡片。她（指用户）会说：“我不想花时间做这个。” 我们就说：“给你，直接下载就行了。” 我们努力让大家尽可能轻松地练习，思考“我该如何用口语表达这些词汇？” 然后再用单词卡片练习词汇。
[00:29:14.310] And then the other point I thought about when you were speaking was, do you guys remember that? Well, it's still out, but I just remember it came out like five years ago, but Parents Are Human card game. So I bought it like right when it came out because I was like, oh, this is so cool. If people don't know what that is, it's this card game that has like very thought provoking questions for your parents. On one side, it's English. The other side, it's started with Chinese, but now it's got like many, many languages.
[00:29:14.310] 然后，你刚才说话的时候，我想到了另一点，你们还记得吗？嗯，它现在还在市面上，但我记得它大概是五年前推出的，叫做《父母也是人》（Parents Are Human）卡牌游戏。我当时一看到就买了，因为我觉得这游戏太酷了。如果有人不知道这是什么，它是一款卡牌游戏，里面有一些非常引人深思的问题，可以问问你的父母。一面是英文，另一面最初是中文，但现在有很多很多语言版本了。
[00:29:43.590] And the idea being we've probably only unlocked a small portion of our own parents' personalities because we don't ask them about deeper stuff. So I played that game with my parents when it first came out and I thought it was so cool. I learned a lot of stuff that I like never knew about my parents. But when I thought about it kind of recently, I was like, this is a good starting point. But sometimes I don't really know what they're saying back to me when it's these deeper conversations as well.
[00:29:43.590] 这个想法是，我们可能只了解了父母性格的一小部分，因为我们很少问他们一些更深层次的问题。这款游戏刚出来的时候，我就和父母一起玩过，我觉得特别棒。我从中了解到很多以前从未了解过的关于父母的事情。但最近我仔细想了想，觉得这确实是一个很好的起点。不过，有时候，在进行一些更深入的对话时，我其实也听不懂他们在说什么。
[00:30:12.150] Or I don't know how to like push it forward more because if I ask it in English, they're kind of like, oh, I don't know. Versus like if I had some more vocabulary around those topics already, maybe I could get deeper. Yeah. I don't know. It's just kind of swirling around in my head. There are so many ways to think about all this stuff. I feel like it's already so challenging to get to know your parents when there's a generation gap. Yes. Especially for our generation and our parents' generation because the technology difference
[00:30:12.150] 或者我不知道该如何更深入地探讨这个问题，因为如果我用英语问，他们就会说，哦，我不知道。但如果我事先掌握一些相关的词汇，也许就能更深入地了解了。是啊，我不知道。这些想法一直在我的脑海里盘旋。关于这些事情，有很多种思考方式。我觉得，当存在代沟的时候，了解父母就已经很困难了。是的。尤其是对我们这一代和我们父母那一代来说，因为科技的差异。
[00:30:39.450] that we're used to in our daily lifestyle is already so massive. But adding language on top of that just makes it so much harder to get to know them, which is why I mentioned this earlier. But it's so rewarding for me to see my parents engage in their social life where I'm like, damn, you guys are rock stars when you speak Korean. Not that they're not, you know, when they speak English, but it's just that's what they're used to. They're so much more comfortable in that environment. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:30:39.450] 我们日常生活中习以为常的东西已经够多了。再加上语言障碍，就更难了解他们了，所以我之前才提到这一点。但看到父母融入他们的社交生活，我真的觉得很欣慰，我会想，哇，你们说韩语的时候简直太棒了！当然，他们说英语的时候也很棒，只是他们更习惯用韩语交流。他们在那种环境下会感觉更自在。是啊，是啊。
[00:31:04.970] I guess it just goes to show that, you know, maybe they don't know our full personality except from what they can observe and what we communicate, limitedly communicate. But then the vice versa is also very true. I actually also have the, my parents are human card deck. And sometimes I'll just like pull one. I don't tell my parents I have it. I just pull one. And I'm like, oh, this is a pretty good question. I'll ask this at dinner. Sure. It's so true.
[00:31:04.970] 我想这正好说明，他们可能并不了解我们完整的性格，只能通过观察和我们有限的交流来了解。反过来也一样。我其实也有一副“我的父母是人”的卡片。有时候我会抽一张，不会告诉他们我有这副卡片，就抽一张。然后我会想，哦，这个问题问得不错，我晚饭的时候问问他们。当然可以。这说得太对了。
[00:31:32.730] Like some of the questions were really basic and I was like, oh my God, I don't know this about my parents. Something like, what was your favorite class or something when you were in school? And I was like, what? Like how, this is such a simple thing that like you probably know a general idea for most of your friends. Like, oh, you know, they were good at this or they liked that certain area of stuff. And you're like, I don't know. What did my parents like? Like, were they forced into their career path or did they choose it?
[00:31:32.730] 有些问题真的很基础，我当时就想，天哪，我对父母的这些事竟然一无所知。比如，你上学时最喜欢的课是什么之类的？我当时就想，什么？这明明是件很简单的事，你可能对大多数朋友的情况都有个大概的了解。比如，哦，你知道，他们擅长什么，或者喜欢什么领域。但你却想，我不知道。我父母喜欢什么？他们是被迫走上现在的职业道路，还是自己选择的？
[00:32:02.050] You know, all that kind of stuff. So I think part of it is as we get older and become like fully fledged adults, sort of, we start to realize like, oh, our parents are just like us. You know, they're not some all knowing being that meets like every single highest standard. It's like, oh, they have personalities too. And they have likes and dislikes and they have strengths and weaknesses. And then once you start to realize that they're people, then you're like, oh, why haven't I
[00:32:02.050] 你知道，就是诸如此类的事情。所以我觉得部分原因是，随着我们年纪渐长，真正长大成人之后，我们会开始意识到，哦，我们的父母其实也和我们一样。他们并非无所不知、完美无缺的存在。他们也有自己的个性，有喜好，有优点，也有缺点。一旦你开始意识到他们也是普通人，你就会想，哦，为什么我以前没意识到这一点呢？
[00:32:30.850] ever had like a real conversation with them? I think it's partially the generation thing is huge. And that's going to be kind of every parent child relationship, honestly. But I think for us, there's that added layer of cultural gap, right? Even with how the parent child relationship is. So I had a whole heart to heart breakdown situation with my parents a few years ago where I was like, you never told me you loved me.
[00:32:30.850] 你跟他们真正好好聊过天吗？我觉得很大一部分原因是代沟问题。说实话，这几乎是所有亲子关系都会遇到的问题。但我觉得对我们来说，还存在着文化差异，对吧？即使亲子关系本身就是这样。几年前，我和父母进行了一次彻底的谈话，我崩溃了，我说，你们从来没有对我说过爱我。
[00:33:00.830] They're like, it's not like my parents ever told me they loved me. You know, I think there's this awakening within ourselves as we get older, where we're realizing all the things we needed growing up and what we still want with those relationships with our parents. And unfortunately, I think a lot of the onus is on us to kind of build that path because they don't necessarily always know how to go about that themselves because they didn't have
[00:33:00.830] 他们会说，我的父母从来没跟我说过“我爱你”。你知道，我觉得随着年龄增长，我们内心会有一种觉醒，开始意识到成长过程中自己需要什么，以及我们现在仍然希望与父母建立怎样的关系。不幸的是，我觉得很多时候，我们需要自己去构建这种关系，因为他们自己未必知道该怎么做，毕竟他们小时候也没有这样的经历。
[00:33:28.450] that relationship with their parents or it wasn't like culturally how family dynamics work when they were growing up. So it's been something I've been trying to work on too is I'm just like, yeah, I should ask them more questions about themselves. And they're always really happy to answer it. They're never like, oh, why do you care? Or like, who cares? They're just like, oh, yeah. I'm like, why don't we ever talk like this? Yeah, I had a moment recently where I realized there's like a meme on TikTok where you tell
[00:33:28.450] 他们和父母的关系，或者说他们成长过程中所处的家庭文化模式，都和他们现在的处境不一样。所以这也是我一直在努力的方向，我会想，我应该多问问他们关于他们自己的问题。他们总是很乐意回答。他们从来不会说，哦，你为什么要关心这些？或者，谁会在乎？他们只会说，哦，是啊。我就想，为什么我们从来不这样交流呢？对了，我最近突然意识到TikTok上有一个梗，就是你告诉
[00:33:58.090] your mom you like this one thing once and then she buys you merch of that thing for the next 20 years. I realized I do that with my parents because I was like talking to my dad and I was like, oh, yeah, dad, like you love strawberries. It's like totally your thing. He's like, I do. And I was like, when I was like 10 that you love strawberries and white chocolate, I thought those were like your top two favorite foods. He was like, oh, I guess I like strawberries. I was like, oh, no, what happened? Like what changed?
[00:33:58.090] 你妈好像知道你曾经喜欢过什么东西，然后接下来20年她就一直给你买那东西的周边。我意识到我跟我爸妈就是这样，因为我跟我爸聊天的时候，我说：“哦，爸，你超爱草莓的，那可是你的最爱啊。” 他说：“是啊。” 我说：“我十岁的时候，你还喜欢草莓和白巧克力，我以为那是你最爱的两种食物呢。” 他说：“哦，我好像也喜欢草莓。” 我当时就懵了，心想：“什么？怎么回事？怎么变了？”
[00:34:26.890] Why are you like a fully dynamic person with changing interests? But I will say one thing that I've been finding very rewarding is now that I'm married to my husband, when he comes over and like has conversations with my parents, he's coming with like a completely new perspective and like a different relationship. Right. So he'll ask questions to my dad about like, oh, how's your time in military, like mandatory military service in Korea? And how is this? Or like, what kind of sports do you like playing? I was like, whoa.
[00:34:26.890] 为什么你会像个充满活力、兴趣不断变化的人呢？不过，有一件事我觉得特别有收获，那就是自从我嫁给我丈夫之后，他每次来我家和我的父母聊天，都会带着一种全新的视角，建立一种全新的关系。他会问我爸爸一些问题，比如，你在军队的日子过得怎么样？在韩国服兵役是强制性的吗？感觉如何？或者，你喜欢玩什么运动？我当时就觉得，哇！
[00:34:54.790] And I learned recently that my dad likes to play basketball. And he like knows all the terms, like three pointer, like layup, like fade away. I was like, who are you? Your dad's like finally a fellow man. My dad even mentioned the Uncle Drew thing for like Kyrie Irving. Oh, my God. Yeah. My dad knows ball. Yeah. He's actually like extremely up to date.
[00:34:54.790] 我最近才知道我爸喜欢打篮球。他好像什么术语都知道，三分球、上篮、后仰跳投什么的。我当时就想，你是谁啊？我爸终于也算个懂球的人了。我爸甚至还提到了凯里·欧文的“德鲁大叔”梗。我的天哪。真的，我爸懂球。真的，他跟得上时代潮流。
[00:35:22.230] I'm thinking about my parents' interests now, too. And I guess like what I mainly get or what I mainly see is maybe if we are like watching something at the dinner table together, or maybe sometimes even if we're like driving in the same car and my parents play like their little Chinese podcast about whatever. But OK, I'm going to be honest. Sometimes these like podcast things are extremely just like out of my league. I'm like, yeah, I just hear Chinese happening.
[00:35:22.230] 我现在也在想我爸妈的兴趣爱好。我猜我主要听到的，或者说我主要看到的，可能是我们一起在餐桌上看电视，或者有时候我们一起开车，我爸妈会放一些中文播客，内容什么的。不过说实话，有时候这些播客对我来说真的太难懂了。我就只能说，嗯，我听着呢，都是中文。
[00:35:51.590] But like, I'm not really absorbing what they're saying. So I know for a bit my parents were actually into like standup comedy, Chinese standup comedy. And I was like, wow, they have that now. That's like a more recent development, I think, within China itself. Yeah. Like otherwise, just like random day to day or maybe even like childhood interests. I wouldn't really know. I think there's also even I'm like, maybe this is too deep. But when I was playing that parents are human game with them, I learned a lot of stuff that
[00:35:51.590] 但是，我好像没怎么听进去他们在说什么。我知道我爸妈有一段时间很喜欢看脱口秀，中国脱口秀。我就想，哇，现在还有这种东西。我觉得这在中国算是比较新的现象。是啊。至于其他的，比如一些日常琐事，甚至是童年时期的兴趣爱好，我就不太清楚了。我觉得，也许我问得太深奥了。但是，当我跟他们玩“父母也是人”的游戏时，我学到了很多东西。
[00:36:21.130] was like kind of traumatic. Like, I don't remember what the question was. I think it was something about sibling dynamics or something. And I learned that some like trauma that both my parents respectively had around siblings like passing away when they were younger. And I was like, I didn't even know you had this sibling. And they're like, yeah, why would we talk about it? I think back to the cultural aspect, right? So much of the harder stuff to talk about.
[00:36:21.130] 那感觉有点像创伤。我记不清当时的问题是什么了，好像是关于兄弟姐妹关系之类的。然后我了解到，我父母各自都有过类似的创伤经历，比如兄弟姐妹在他们很小的时候就去世了。我就说，我甚至都不知道你们还有个兄弟姐妹。他们说，是啊，我们为什么要谈这个？我觉得这跟文化因素有关，对吧？很多比较难启齿的话题都难以启齿。
[00:36:47.910] A lot of times they just don't share because they're like, we don't talk about that stuff. That's just how the culture is. But that's important. That seems like it's pretty important and probably like shaped how you think about, you know, your relationship with your family and how much time we should be spending together and all that. And so it's very interesting when we try to bridge with our Western and a lot of like, I don't know, self-growth therapy stuff that we work on, like to their very Eastern and kind
[00:36:47.910] 很多时候他们只是不愿分享，因为他们会说：“我们不谈这些事。这就是我们的文化。”但这很重要。这似乎非常重要，而且可能影响了你对家庭关系的看法，以及我们应该花多少时间在一起等等。所以，当我们尝试用我们西方的、类似自我成长疗法之类的东西去连接他们非常东方、非常友善的文化时，这非常有趣。
[00:37:17.790] of like keep it to yourself way of thinking a lot of times. So I do think there's just so much where it's like, you never know until you ask. And onus is on us to ask, I think. Like, and I think to an extent, I mean, I think fully our parents also realize this and also feel the gap and also understand the cultural divide is what I'm thinking. I had a conversation with my mom where I was like, you know, I've been going to therapy recently. It's life changing. It's really helped me, blah, blah. And she was like, oh my God, good for you. That sounds great.
[00:37:17.790] 很多时候，我们都抱着一种“把事情藏在心里”的想法。所以我觉得很多事情都是这样，不问就永远不会知道。我觉得我们有责任去问。而且我觉得在某种程度上，我们的父母也意识到了这一点，他们也感受到了这种差距，也理解文化差异。我和我妈聊过，我说我最近一直在接受心理治疗，这改变了我的人生，真的帮了我很多，等等等等。她听了之后说，我的天哪，真为你高兴。听起来很棒。
[00:37:47.610] Like so worth the investment, like blah, blah, like really hyping me up to go. And then I was like, oh yeah, like maybe you and dad should try sometime. Like it's really cool. And then she was like, no, we're good. Like we don't want to air out our like shit. And I was like, oh, okay. You just said it was really good for me, but that's cool. I guess. Yeah. Your parents are already at least more Western than my parents. My mom was like, oh, why are you going to see a therapist? Are you crazy or something? I'm like, oh, cool. Cool. Good talk. Yeah.
[00:37:47.610] 就像“这投资太值了”之类的，巴拉巴拉，真的把我鼓舞得想去。然后我就说，哦，对啊，也许你和爸爸应该找个时间试试。真的很棒。然后她说，不用了，我们挺好的。我们不想把家里的破事儿都说出来。我就说，哦，好吧。你刚才还说这对我很有好处，不过也行吧。我想也是。是啊。你父母至少比我父母更西化。我妈说，哦，你为什么要去看心理医生？你疯了吗？我就说，哦，酷。酷。聊得不错。是啊。
[00:38:19.110] Yeah. I think I've actually explained therapy to my mom once or twice before. And she was just like, cool, dot, dot, dot. But then I like kind of went into it and like explained. I was like, yeah, you know, if I feel like there's issues that I need to like talk about or ask someone for help with like how to think about this, how to get over it, or even in like relationships with like friends, parents, romantic relationships, you know, it's a resource, blah, blah, blah. My mom was like, yeah, I guess it sounds not bad.
[00:38:19.110] 是啊。我之前好像跟我妈解释过一两次心理咨询。她当时就说，哦，好，就没下文了。然后我就更详细地解释了一下。我说，嗯，你知道，如果我觉得有些问题需要倾诉，或者需要找人帮忙，比如该怎么看待这件事，怎么克服它，甚至是和朋友、父母、恋人之间的关系，你知道，心理咨询是一种资源，等等等等。我妈就说，嗯，听起来还不错。
[00:38:48.590] And then that's like the conversation just ends there. I'm like, oh, cool. At least she listened. I think my parents get it now, but I do think something I realized was, I don't know if your parents do the same thing, but my parents used like me and my brother as their therapists. So I think I tried to explain it to them that way once where I was like, you know how you
[00:38:48.590] 然后对话就这么结束了。我就想，哦，挺好的。至少她听进去了。我觉得我爸妈现在应该明白了，但我确实意识到，我不知道你爸妈是不是也这样，但我爸妈以前会把我和我哥当成他们的心理咨询师。所以我想我曾经试着用那种方式跟他们解释过，我说，你知道你
[00:39:12.530] just like shit on dad when you guys are fighting to like me or my brother and you like expect us to listen and like give you advice and stuff. It's kind of like that, but with a stranger who's not invested in like the drama. Oh my God. Relatable. That's so funny. Did your parents, were they like, oh, you know, that sounds kind of good. No, they were like, they were like, oh, I mean, I guess that makes sense, but they still
[00:39:12.530] 就像你们为了我和我弟弟吵架，还指望我们听你们的，给你们提建议什么的，然后就对爸爸发火一样。有点像那样，只不过对象是个陌生人，一个对你们的闹剧不感兴趣的人。我的天哪。太有共鸣了。真搞笑。你爸妈当时是不是觉得，哦，听起来还不错？不，他们当时是，哦，我的意思是，我猜这说得通，但他们还是
[00:39:42.110] are so Eastern in that mindset where they're like, oh, why would you air your baggage to a stranger? Yeah. Yeah. Like that's for your family to deal with. I'm like, that's not healthy, but they're actually your friend. You just give them money. They're like, but you're free. Yeah, exactly. To tie it back to like what you were saying earlier, the vibe I get is like my parents just want to move on.
[00:39:42.110] 他们那种东方人的思维方式太根深蒂固了，他们会说，哦，你为什么要跟陌生人倾诉你的烦恼？是啊，是啊。好像那是你家人该处理的事。我就想，这样不好，但他们毕竟是你的朋友。你只是给他们钱而已。他们会说，但你是自由的。对，没错。就像你之前说的，我的感觉是，我父母只想翻篇。
[00:40:09.690] They don't want to like hang back and do a breakdown of what just happened. It's kind of like, okay, well that sucks. Like let's move on and look to the next thing. There's no point in like getting stuck in this. On one hand, that makes a lot of sense. But then on the other hand, it's like, I'm sure there's some lessons you could learn or maybe like insight you could gain from looking back on this. Maybe not, of course, like getting really stuck on it, but like, you know, just kind of breaking
[00:40:09.690] 他们不想停下来仔细分析刚才发生的事情。感觉就像是，好吧，真糟糕。我们还是继续前进，看看下一件事吧。纠结于此毫无意义。一方面，这很有道理。但另一方面，又觉得，回顾这件事肯定能从中吸取一些教训，或者获得一些启发。当然，也许不是真的要一直纠结于此，而是……你知道，可以稍微反思一下。
[00:40:37.410] it down and being like, okay, next time if this were to happen again, I'm prepared. So I think it's like definitely pros and cons. If you go all in on one way, it's not going to be that helpful. And if you go all in on the other way, that's also probably not going to be the most helpful either. Yeah, I feel like this is why I'm so excited to have kids of my own because I don't know if either of you guys follow Alex Earl, but she's like the new generations, it girl, like TikTok famous.
[00:40:37.410] 把这件事记下来，然后想，好吧，下次如果再发生这种情况，我就做好准备了。所以我觉得这绝对是有利有弊。如果你完全偏向某一方面，那肯定没什么帮助。如果你完全偏向另一方面，那可能也帮不上什么忙。是啊，我觉得这就是为什么我这么期待自己有孩子的原因，因为我不知道你们有没有关注Alex Earl，她就像是新一代的网红，TikTok上的红人。
[00:41:06.070] And she is very close to her parents. They go partying, they go like clubbing together. And that's not necessarily the relationship that I want with my kids. But that's something where I'm like, damn, if you're like from the same culture, age gap isn't that big, don't have a language barrier, even if it's a small one. That's the kind of relationship that you can have. And I want to have a relationship with my kids where they're close to my friends, you know,
[00:41:06.070] 她和父母关系非常亲密。他们经常一起参加聚会，一起去夜店。这不一定是我想要和孩子建立的关系。但我觉得，如果你们来自相同的文化背景，年龄差距不大，没有语言障碍（哪怕只有一点点），那才是可以拥有的关系。我希望我的孩子能和我的朋友亲近，你知道吗？
[00:41:32.890] and they can like joke around and like have really open and honest conversations with us about being a teenager or like growing up instead of a lot of it going unsaid where you're just like, I don't even want to like bother explaining this. Like they won't get it. They didn't grow up here or whatever. I think there's just a lot more shared experience that can happen. And I am beyond grateful for the relationship that I have with my parents, but I just feel like there's a different path out there too that I also want to experience. For sure.
[00:41:32.890] 他们可以和我们开玩笑，可以和我们坦诚地聊聊青春期或者成长的话题，而不是很多事情都藏在心里，让你觉得“我都不想解释了，他们肯定不懂，他们又不是在这里长大的”。我觉得这样能有更多共同的经历。我非常感激我和父母的关系，但我也觉得人生还有另一条路，我也想去体验。当然。
[00:42:00.690] I don't think my husband has the same relationship where he'll go clubbing with his parents. But when I first saw them talk over dinner, I was like, wow, you guys are really close. Like he calls them by their first name. I'm like, oh my God. The disrespect, you know? I was like, what is this? But no, it's very like endearing. And I noticed he and his brother always make fun of their mom, but in a, you know, lighthearted way.
[00:42:00.690] 我觉得我老公跟父母的关系不会像我老公那样，会跟他们一起去夜店。但我第一次看到他们一起吃饭聊天的时候，就觉得，哇，你们关系真好。他居然直呼父母的名字。我当时就想，我的天哪，这算什么？这太不尊重人了吧？我当时就想，这是什么情况？但后来想想，这反而挺温馨的。我还注意到他和他哥哥总是拿他们妈妈开玩笑，不过都是那种轻松的玩笑。
[00:42:29.970] And I was like, this is such a different dynamic than like my parents and us. So, so much of it, I think is also like the culture you want to build within your family. Cause even if you speak the same language, it's not like every, for example, like every rando white American family is like tight just because they all speak English and they might be closer in age. We don't know. Everyone's different. Right. I think it's what you want to build out of it, but I do agree.
[00:42:29.970] 我当时就想，这跟我父母和我们家的相处模式完全不一样。所以，我觉得很大程度上也取决于你想在家庭内部建立怎样的文化。因为即使你们说同一种语言，也不代表每个普通的美国白人家庭就一定关系很铁，仅仅因为他们都会说英语，年龄也比较接近。我们不知道。每个人都不一样。没错。我觉得关键在于你想从中建立什么，但我同意你的观点。
[00:42:55.730] There's so much, if you really did grow up in the same environment or had the same shared experiences as like kids, there's more that you can relate on, but it's really, I think up to you on how you build that family culture. And going back to us with our parents, I think I'm trying to like change our family culture. I'm like, let's like be a little closer. I'm like share a little more than we used to. Yeah.
[00:42:55.730] 如果你和孩子真的在相同的环境中长大，或者有着相同的共同经历，那么你们之间会有很多共鸣。但我觉得，如何构建家庭文化，最终还是取决于你自己。就拿我们和父母的关系来说，我觉得我正在努力改变我们家的家庭文化。我想，让我们更亲近一些，多分享一些事情。是的。
[00:43:22.890] I think it's a lot when you think about it, we're not only bridging the gap between us generation wise, but there's the language and the culture, like all the things that we've mentioned. And so you're so right. Jisoo, if we were to have children, unless we move to like a brand new country with a different language again, but I feel like there's a lot less to bridge the gap for. And then you can just focus on the one or two like differences that we're trying to like
[00:43:22.890] 仔细想想，这确实很多，我们不仅要弥合代沟，还有语言、文化等等，就像我们之前提到的那些。所以你说得太对了。Jisoo，如果我们以后有了孩子，除非我们搬到另一个语言完全不同的国家，否则我觉得需要弥合的代沟会少很多。这样我们就可以专注于一两个我们努力想要喜欢的差异。
[00:43:52.810] reach over to build that relationship with. So right now our relationship building with family is on hard mode. And hopefully that means that in the future it becomes easier and easier. Agreed. The culture aspect actually is a big part of the really Mandarin stuff. So we've thus far talked a lot about where we feel a little bit restricted in our language
[00:43:52.810] 努力去建立这种关系。所以目前我们和家人的关系建设还处于困难阶段。希望这意味着未来会越来越容易。没错。文化因素确实是汉语学习中非常重要的一部分。所以到目前为止，我们已经讨论了很多关于我们在语言方面感到有些受限的地方。
[00:44:19.330] when we try to talk to, for example, like adult cousins back in Asia and whatever. But I think a lot of times also with language, people think about where's the gap between me and a native speaker. So if it's Chinese, it'd be like, where's the gap between me and someone in China or me and someone in Taiwan and someone in Korea. Right. But we did grow up so different from those people that there's a big part of our personalities, a big part of our experiences that are tied to being Western.
[00:44:19.330] 例如，当我们尝试和远在亚洲的成年表亲或其他什么人交流时，就会遇到这种情况。但我觉得很多时候，人们在语言方面也会思考自己和母语人士之间的差距。比如，如果是中文，人们就会想，我和中国人、台湾人、韩国人之间的差距在哪里。没错。但我们成长的环境和他们截然不同，所以我们性格中很大一部分、经历中很大一部分都与西方文化息息相关。
[00:44:49.150] So I'd say a third of the existing course in really Mandarin is based on talking about the cultural difference stuff. Some of it is kind of applicable regardless of where you grew up, if you're just talking about the news or whatever. But even like dating is different, right? Because West is a lot more casual and confusing, I think, than standard Asian wholesome dating styles.
[00:44:49.150] 所以我觉得，现在普通话课程里大概有三分之一的内容都是在讲文化差异。有些内容可能不管你在哪里长大，比如聊聊新闻什么的，都适用。但就连约会都不一样，对吧？因为我觉得西方的约会方式比亚洲传统的、比较健康的约会方式要随意得多，也更让人摸不着头脑。
[00:45:17.270] Also things that are only things we would understand. So even when I was building the course with my Taiwan based Mandarin teacher partner, I have the section around like being a minority in a majority society or like media representation. And she did the translation stuff and I would look at it. I'm like, that's not what I meant. I'm just like, so what did you mean? I'm like, well, when you are like the only one in the class that looks like this or whatever,
[00:45:17.270] 还有一些事情只有我们才能理解。所以，即使我和我那位在台湾的汉语老师搭档一起开发课程的时候，我也会讲到像“在主流社会中成为少数群体”或者“媒体形象”之类的话题。她负责翻译，我看了之后会说：“这不是我的意思。” 我会问：“那你到底是什么意思？” 我会说：“嗯，当你是班上唯一一个长成这样的人的时候……”
[00:45:44.010] you know, I had to explain what that actual experience is because they don't have that experience. It's like impossible for them to know what that experience is because that's something they'd only know if they grew up here. So a big part of the course content is around like, how do you give words to that experience that only you could have? Because I think I get frustrated sometimes when people that are native are like, oh, you want to improve your Mandarin?
[00:45:44.010] 你知道，我得解释那种经历究竟是什么，因为他们没有那种经历。对他们来说，那几乎是不可能的，因为只有在这里长大的人才能体会到那种感觉。所以课程内容很大一部分都围绕着这样一个问题：如何用语言来描述只有你才能拥有的那种经历？因为有时候，当母语人士问我“哦，你想提高你的普通话水平吗？”的时候，我会感到很沮丧。
[00:46:11.030] Just like watch a bunch of Chinese shows and you'll become fluent. I'm like, I guess, but then I'm going to sound super haony, super Chinese. And like, that still doesn't give me the words for when I'm talking about a fight I had today with a coworker or whatever, because it's so contextual to growing up here. And also culturally, we're much more, I don't know if you think about this a lot, but we're a lot more straightforward in the West. We're like kind of blunt sometimes with how we talk versus in a lot of Asian languages,
[00:46:11.030] 就像看很多中国电视剧就能说一口流利的中文一样。我心想，我大概是这么想的，但那样的话我的中文听起来就会特别土，特别像中国人。而且，就算这样，我还是没法用合适的词语来描述我今天和同事吵架之类的事情，因为这跟我在这里的成长经历息息相关。另外，从文化角度来说，我们西方人说话更直接，我不知道你有没有想过这一点。我们说话有时候比较直白，不像很多亚洲语言那样委婉。
[00:46:39.530] it's a lot more buffered. Like you find a nicer way to say things. You're going to like talk around something. I've also found where I'm trying to say something and they're like, whoa, did you mean to say it like that? Because it sounded really harsh. I'm like, oh, it didn't sound harsh in my head because in English, it wouldn't have been that way. So I think something a lot of people don't think about is like how much culture plays into language and how you would actually express something.
[00:46:39.530] 感觉语气更委婉。你会用更委婉的方式表达。你会绕着弯子说话。我还发现，有时候我想说点什么，对方会说：“哇，你是故意这么说的吗？”因为听起来很生硬。我就说：“哦，我当时没觉得生硬，因为用英语表达的话，就不会是那样。”所以我觉得很多人忽略了文化对语言的影响，以及文化对实际表达方式的影响。
[00:47:06.990] So we try to tackle a big part of that with really Mandarin. That makes a lot of sense. And you're so right about the cultural impact of how we speak as well, because especially when you're saying like how in Western culture, we're a little more blunt. And I'm sure a lot of people are similar to this, where if you have a second language, you're usually trying to like translate your English sentence into that other language.
[00:47:06.990] 所以我们尝试用普通话来解决这个问题。这很有道理。你说的文化影响也完全正确，尤其是在西方文化中，我们说话比较直白。我相信很多人都有类似的经历，如果你会说第二语言，你通常会尝试把你的英语句子翻译成另一种语言。
[00:47:34.070] And then you like say it out, especially more like complex sentences. And so then it maybe when you say it, the person who is listening is like that low key makes no sense in the context of this language. Like, what are you saying? And you're like, no, that's just how we say it in English. And they're like, that's maybe this one idiom or like this one phrase you tried to say it like doesn't exist or that that's just like words stitched together that you just said. So I feel like that's so true.
[00:47:34.070] 然后你把它说出来，尤其是一些比较复杂的句子。所以当你这么说的时候，听的人可能会觉得，这在英语语境里根本说不通。他们会问，你在说什么？然后你会说，不，我们英语就是这么表达的。他们会说，也许你用的这个习语或者这个短语根本不存在，或者你刚才说的只是把一些词拼凑起来而已。我觉得这说得太对了。
[00:48:03.410] Well, there's definitely some that are similar because I think I was talking to my mom about how to say something's really popular. How do you say that in Chinese? And she was like, oh, well, one of the like more slang ways to say this is just to say something is like fire, literally. And I was like, oh my God, that's how we say it in English. She was like, that's crazy. But there's definitely also ones that are like completely different where I was like, oh, we kind of say it this way and like more colloquial or like slang way in English. And she was like, yeah, you can't say that in Chinese.
[00:48:03.410] 嗯，肯定有些说法很相似，因为我记得我之前跟我妈聊过，如果某样东西很流行，中文里怎么说？她说，哦，比较俚语的说法就是说它“火爆”，字面意思就是“火爆”。我说，我的天，英语里就是这么说的。她说，太不可思议了。但肯定也有一些说法完全不同，比如我说，哦，英语里我们用这种比较口语化或者俚语的方式来表达。她说，对，中文里不能这么说。
[00:48:34.590] So I feel like that's definitely helpful to have more insight in the cultural way and like colloquial way that people say stuff. The other thing that randomly came to mind is I find that I if I really sit down and think about the way that I perceive or like describe something, I feel like I call upon things that are very relevant in like US culture. So like sometimes I'll see something and be like, oh, this is like sorority vibes or like, oh, this is just like science camp or, you know, things that we're so used to.
[00:48:34.590] 所以我觉得，了解不同文化背景下人们的表达方式，尤其是口语化的表达方式，真的很有帮助。另外，我突然想到，如果我真的静下心来思考自己感知或描述某件事的方式，我感觉自己会用到一些非常贴近美国文化的东西。比如，有时候我看到一些东西，就会想，哦，这感觉就像是大学姐妹会的氛围，或者，哦，这就像是科学夏令营，或者，你知道的，一些我们习以为常的东西。
[00:49:03.910] And sometimes I notice my parents do the same thing. But for their Korean lived experience, they'll say, oh, this looks like a Sujeonhue or whatever. And I just remember having these conversations with my parents where I was like sitting down trying to explain what a sorority was. I was like, oh, it's kind of like this club, but it's all girls. I'm like you pay and, you know, you do these things and they're just like, what? So I don't know, like a lot of even these small things in our daily interactions can feel
[00:49:03.910] 有时候我注意到我父母也会做同样的事。但就他们韩国的生活经历而言，他们会说，哦，这看起来像个社团之类的。我记得以前和父母聊天的时候，我坐下来试图解释什么是姐妹会。我说，哦，它有点像那种俱乐部，只不过都是女生。我说，你要交钱，然后，你知道，你要参加这些活动，他们就一脸懵，什么？所以，我不知道，很多日常互动中的小事都会让人觉得……
[00:49:31.390] like not divisive, but just like another reminder of like, oh, we like grew up differently. So I wonder if having more of that like shared vocabulary or even like the methodology and like the words to describe these differences would aid a lot in these conversations as well. Wait, that's so funny that you brought up the sorority thing, because I had that experience in college where I was trying to explain to my parents. I was like, oh, yeah, I joined this like club.
[00:49:31.390] 倒不是说要制造分裂，只是又一次提醒我们，哦，我们的成长环境不一样。所以我在想，如果我们能有更多共同的词汇，或者说，更多描述这些差异的方法和词语，是不是对这类对话会有很大帮助。等等，你居然提到了姐妹会，真是太巧了，因为我大学的时候也有过类似的经历，当时我正试图向父母解释。我就说，哦，对，我加入了一个社团。
[00:49:56.850] And then the good thing was that one of my family friends did like a fraternity. So I was like, yeah, it's just like what this family friend did, except ours is like both boys and girls. And I have like a big and she's like, oh, OK, so like you have like a big sister kind of thing. And I was like, yeah, pretty much. And we just left it at that. That's pretty close. I was like, thank God someone already explained it for me.
[00:49:56.850] 然后，好消息是，我家一个朋友加入了一个类似兄弟会的组织。我就说，对，这跟他家朋友的差不多，只不过我们这个组织男女都有。我有个“大姐姐”，她就说，哦，原来你有个像姐姐一样的人。我说，对，差不多。然后我们就没再多说了。差不多就是这样。我当时就想，谢天谢地，有人已经给我解释清楚了。
[00:50:25.150] And I just have to tag on to it. Well, this has been such an insightful conversation. I don't think I've ever realized how many gaps and like voids there are in my Korean vocabulary. So this is definitely a signal for me to sit down and read some words in the dictionary. But thank you, Angela, so much for joining us today.
