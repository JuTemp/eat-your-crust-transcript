[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Jimmy. I'm Eddie So we're back to talk about breakups There's still a lot we have a lot left on our outline to talk about. The doc is quite long
[00:00:25.150] The Google Doc I'm looking at. It's a two pager. Yeah So, let's just jump into it. First question. Do you think there's an ideal way to handle a breakup? I have an ideal way Well one thing I Helped a lot was going to the gym
[00:00:41.710] I feel like there's a whole like subset of like memes right now about breaking up and then No, I actually don't send it to you as much I send it to people I actually go to the gym I'm not
[00:01:02.390] But it's like it's like a whole subset where it's like this gym bro was born because It is like I feel like that definitely helped me a lot and obviously this is kind of like a very surface level way to
[00:01:13.070] Do it. Well, I do think it's a form of like working on yourself like self-improvement And it makes you feel like you're progressing in something and gives you something to focus on use you some goals So I feel like that helped me a lot
[00:01:24.910] I'm not like the biggest person, but I feel like I've made some like gains, you know this year So like I feel pretty good about that Bro, dude, I'm so ready to post the before and after pictures
[00:01:35.430] Cuz I was fucking I let myself go. I was skinny as shit Like I was not I did not feel or look good. Yeah, I feel like I'm a lot more confident myself now
[00:01:43.510] So that's definitely playing like a big role. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I mean if you look at him from the back You see that, you know I For all the single ladies out there Jimmy likes my back
[00:02:00.790] He's copping a feel, you know, yeah, I think that's a good one also exercise is supposed to like give you endorphins So do I think I think my body kind of changed after working all irregularly cuz I feel like I sweat more It's like not good changes. I'm
[00:02:14.910] Maybe like testosterone or something. I'm going like more body hair and shit. Oh, dude testosterone. Yeah, like Okay, so it's not like it's not You know, like I had like a few before my brother for example, he's four years younger
[00:02:37.190] He has a lot of chest hair straight up like chest hair I So he has a lot I was like roasted in front of you know, cuz it looks like ugly he has to like shaving
[00:02:54.070] so I was like, you know, it's something I always made fun of him for and then Recently, I've noticed like I've been like it's not like that but like a few like more strands, you know
[00:03:03.430] My body going through changes bro. Do you have more facial hair now too? Yeah, you're gonna grow your facial hair I mean like the testosterone back. Okay. No, so I
[00:03:13.230] Have noticed like I feel like my beard goes up like a little higher almost to like my cheekbone sometimes So that's like inconvenient. I don't like that before it was like patchy to like my mid jaw
[00:03:23.810] No, it's like patchy all the way up to like my cheekbones. I don't like that bro My guess what here you might get some nipple hairs If you want your best friend to rub your back I don't think everybody
[00:03:53.470] Exercise in general is good though. Yeah, I think running is also a really good activity If you don't want to like hit the gym running is top five breakup activity. I
[00:04:02.830] Will say though. I think that's like in general like a mentality right not being complacent. I feel like In a relationship a lot at the end like I feel like I was like pretty complacent with a lot of things
[00:04:13.530] So it's a way to like kind of break out of that. You know what it is I think it's like filling the void, right? Yeah A huge part of your life is now gone. You gotta fill that up somehow, right?
[00:04:23.730] Yeah, so many things are just filling up the void. Yeah Like I'm more extroverted now cuz like I got Yeah, yeah, they've been neglected for a little too long Exercising is one of the things that you can do by yourself and it's
[00:04:43.210] If you really like going out to eat and stuff, it's always dependent on someone coming with you unless you're I'll be eating That is underrated I feel more people need to eat so No, I feel like it's a part of building out your new routine again
[00:05:00.330] Like there were things that you were so used to in your life when you had this partner and now it's like everything in your Schedules are free for all so workouts are like a good way to kind of patch that in. Yeah
[00:05:10.170] I really is just like getting hobbies and then talking to your friends again Yeah, and that's like the ideal way, right? Right? Yeah Like kind of just taking action and something and like not letting yourself just sit there in like too much pity because I feel like
[00:05:24.650] It's really easy like get stuck in your head Just be like wow, I'm so sad and then you don't do anything or like I'm so sad There's nothing to do and then that just ends up being pretty rough
[00:05:33.370] Yeah, cuz that's why I feel like a lot of people, you know reach out to their exes after breakups cuz like fucking low They got nothing yet. They got nothing going on at that time, you know
[00:05:42.170] So you allow your yourself to like start thinking about the eggs and start, you know, like I'd be so much happier right now Right here, you know, I think you just like keep yourself busy and then yeah after that point like it just it's natural You know
[00:05:54.810] What about people who dive really headfirst into like dating or sometimes not even dating, right? It's like people who really lean into the hooking up Well, I think everyone's entitled to a home Yeah, if you want to go
[00:06:15.770] Everyone's entitled to you know have their fun. Oh, I'll just do it safely. I have a question Do you think there's like a refractory period where like you shouldn't? There's like a respectable amount of time before like, you know, maybe a little bit
[00:06:30.610] What's like the rule of thumb is the rule of thumb I feel like at the absolute minimum like two weeks Oh I think that's to me. It's like there's like a External facing refractory period and an internal one internal one. I feel like maybe like two weeks
[00:06:53.610] Then you can allow yourself to like stew over and then the end to stuff that could be like a distraction But externally it's probably longer right? Like I wouldn't want my ex to be like, oh
[00:07:03.270] I'm with whoever right on social media like right after the breakup. Yeah, social media is crazy. Yeah Okay, but hear me out. I think that it should be a little longer because if you're like just sadly Hooking up with people. I think that I
[00:07:40.070] Feel like let's say you're not totally Ready, maybe and you're just going on hooking up and then afterwards you're like wow That was kind of lame actually because this is so like meaningless Like I just hooked up with someone and now I'm just like empty feeling
[00:07:54.270] I feel like if it's kind of that thing, right you just prolong your sadness That's true, or it could be a way of snapping you out of it and be like, oh wow. This is so pointless I should work on myself or I should look for something meaningful
[00:08:08.590] Or it's just like claiming back that part of your life too, right? Yeah, you know because a lot of that intimacy used to be associated with your ex if you claim that back then
[00:08:19.070] You know, you're not holding on to it or you're not reserving that part of yourself just for your ex It's like taking it back. Yeah That's a good way of putting it because I feel like a lot of the times it could lean into the territory of like
[00:08:32.710] Replacing what you had with your ex of like, oh, I miss my ex So I'm gonna do try to replicate what I had with her with all these other Nameless people which just probably makes you feel shitty in the long run
[00:08:43.510] but if you think of it as like I am Taking this back and this is a part of my individuality part of my sexuality And just like owning that then I feel like it's a little bit more empowering. Yeah, I think it really just depends on the intent
[00:08:56.430] You know Yeah, if you're sad fucking If you got a boy you're filling over like being this shit, you know, then obviously that's bad But if you're in a generally good place and you just like, you know
[00:09:12.030] You're you're trying you're doing something that you can't do before obviously. Yeah, I think that's healthy. That's true. That's true Yeah, I think it probably just depends on like each person's Threshold for like when they're ready. I also don't think there's anything wrong with
[00:09:27.950] Trying to go on dates because I think that's part of the healing process Like you're getting used to meeting new people again and like coming to terms with the idea that You could be you know
[00:09:38.410] Like with someone else and like, you know get to know them or just like that that whole concept So I think you know getting on the apps I guess Trying to go on some dates is definitely not necessarily like a bad thing
[00:09:59.030] Cuz I think also a lot of people who I know personally like after a long-term relationship breakup They're on the apps more to like feel it out. Not necessarily really like look for a new long-term relationship Yeah, I feel like that's you know, it's helpful you're like
[00:10:16.630] Yeah, it's like can I even physically meet new people true exactly so used to this one relationship But I will say it's kind of interesting because I feel like there is a certain element of like politics to post breakup
[00:10:29.790] Relationships or dating and things like that because I've definitely been in my fair share of girls chats where it's like Oh my god, guess who's fucking ex? I just saw on hand and like screenshots are sent and stuff
[00:10:40.790] So I feel like you know people talk yeah, and that's probably one of those tricky aspects. You have to navigate as well Wait, but actually on hinge now, there's a thing where you can put like looking for long-term short-term
[00:10:57.350] It's nice overall, but I also feel like this is corny as fuck It is kind of because it's like if you put long-term relationship Yeah, maybe you are at that phase of your life but like how do you know like someone
[00:11:08.590] Like that's immediately what you want, you know Cuz it varies from my person person that you meet right? You might want a long-term relationship with someone But you might want just like a who knows they they might just want short-term stuff
[00:11:21.550] They could put short term in that case. Yeah, but my point is it's it feels like very like pressure How do you even know you want a long-term relationship like to that extent, right? I think you do I can't imagine someone clearly putting
[00:11:38.030] Maybe it's just maybe it's that she doesn't know How should I know? This is why I haven't answered that problem It's not on my profile You're gonna have to figure it out I'll keep it to myself
[00:11:51.030] I do think sometimes it's like off-putting if like someone with a like long-term looking for a long-term Relationship pops up on your feed when you're looking for a short term then you're like, okay immediately
[00:12:02.990] It's like a pro and a con because one maybe that person comes off kind of corny to you But it's also a pro because you know right away You're not gonna waste their time. Yeah, maybe they should make it a filter too
[00:12:14.990] Oh, I feel like actually I need to check I'm not sure I never filtered by that I don't judge Long term sure! I'm an open guy I'd be down
[00:12:31.750] Think it was interesting what you mentioned earlier Jisoo about the like internal versus external like maybe internally you're already ready to Start going on the dating apps or whatever, but it's a little weird to post that externally or like make it known externally
[00:12:47.550] But why is it weird? Is it because like your ex might see but like what if you guys like blocked each other? Like wouldn't blocking kind of protect you from these things But I mean realistically I think news still gets around
[00:13:06.230] Like people will talk and I think it's natural like it's very natural to assume that after a breakup two people will find other People but I do think there's like a certain politeness to like navigating that Yeah, but I don't know what the exact like frame of references
[00:13:22.990] I mean for some people they might find it offensive even like six months after like, oh, that's too early for other people They might not give a shit after like a week So it's really person by person
[00:13:31.470] But it's still like something that you should probably at least think about yeah But then does that lead to like people holding things back? Oh like not posting on social Yeah, does that kind of just like prevent someone who's like, I don't know already moving on I guess
[00:13:48.350] Post on social or whatever about everything and anything that they want to post about I Think probably a little bit. Yeah. Yeah I mean, I think it's just it's kind of like a public perception thing mixed with like a consideration thing
[00:14:02.590] It's like one like you probably don't want your ex to feel shitty about like seeing you like just like fucking around The other part is like you don't want your public image to be like, oh, he's already moving on
[00:14:16.670] You know, so it's like kind of like navigating that and like I think it is person-to-person But just doing whatever you feel like is respectful and yeah Comfortable with you and other parties involved and obviously that's gonna differ, too
[00:14:29.470] Do you think there's like a right amount of time to wait then? I think there is. Oh, okay I don't know what the exact number is But here's what I'm thinking like what you said about public perception actually makes me how to think about this
[00:14:40.230] Because a lot of social media to me is like messaging You have some sort of message and that's why you post on your story and your Instagram or whatever so If I was a neutral party and I was seeing someone who just got out of a relationship
[00:14:55.150] Post say a new boo or like, you know, whatever. I would probably think that oh this person is already over their ex and Then it trickles into like a decision tree, right? It's like why are they over their ex so soon is this person's or like, you know
[00:15:10.230] Does this mean that this was less meaningful or like, you know There's so many things that people can do and obviously all of it is speculation
[00:15:15.990] But the fact that you're even having people think these things in the first place is like a choice sort of so then maybe that's Why there is some sort of polite time frame again. I don't know what it would be probably at least three months, maybe
[00:15:31.830] There's a lot of intent behind every decision a lot and you have to read into it You know and then interpret it like in your own way Interpreted how you think that the person posting it would have like wanted you to interpret it, you know
[00:15:43.870] So there's there's a fucking Game of Thrones modern day game of everyone others like Peter Bayliss Little finger. Yeah, I feel like there's another interpretation of like oh, is this a rebound? Yeah. Oh true
[00:15:59.350] I think 100% of the time no. Yeah, I guess probably your mind can definitely default Yeah, yeah, that's true yeah, they're getting it with someone like immediately immediately if not like within a month
[00:16:12.750] I think that's a rebound. That's for sure. You know, it's tough to say no matter what timing there is I think you owe it to yourself after a breakup to Give yourself time to heal
[00:16:24.030] Yeah, like, you know, you're the best judge of like the right way to do that It's like sure like other people are gonna interpret it, you know the way they want but yeah
[00:16:32.390] I think it's just like person to person and then also like people are gonna have different ways of feeling So as long as you're able to do it and that like navigate that situation in a way that feels like true to yourself
[00:16:42.790] I think that's like good. It's like how long does it take for a heart to heal? I mean, I'll be honest. I was not above like some petty social media shit back in the day
[00:16:56.890] Like I definitely don't like high school for you. Yeah, but it's like, you know, I think those urges exist That's why we try to like be mature and like oh just you know, whatever But I feel like the urges are like deep down there Like our human instinct
[00:17:11.590] Oh for sure, there's been so many Sorry about that I think it's just natural to want to be like oh after the breakup I look so much better now or like I'm with this guy who's so nice or whatever
[00:17:23.310] Like I've definitely done that shit in the past and I feel like it feels kind of good It feels hella good Yeah, it definitely feels good and it's like fun There's a way not to be petty about it too
[00:17:33.110] Like I feel like when I post on Instagram now, I'm just like trying to Well, I didn't post that much during my relationship I feel like I didn't post that much before it either But I've been posting, it's a good like self-confidence boost
[00:17:41.110] Trying to like not keep it like petty or related to my relationship Just like whatever brings you joy Yeah, like yeah That's true, but you're right Like the urge to essentially be like the winner I guess Right, right So speaking of winners Great transition
[00:18:01.110] Do you think there's a winner and a loser in breakups? 100% 100% There's always going to be a natural level of competition But then like what defines a win in like a breakup? That is also very subjective I'd say I think on a superficial level
[00:18:19.110] It's like whoever ends up with the hotter Oh wow Very superficial level That's why some people Yeah, it's like there's always a reacher and a settler Yeah, yeah, yeah So there's two factors to this There's the timing element, right Like if someone moves on quicker
[00:18:37.110] They won kind of, right There's also like the superficial factor Which is like if you ended up with someone hotter than your ex Then that's another thing Damn But these are very surface level type win-lose That's what people see on social media And they're like
[00:18:53.110] Oh, like Eddie won the relationship Won the breakup I'm still working on it I see he's trying to be honest Can you give me a high five? Yeah, yeah, yeah Still working on it I think you're right though Maybe one really easy example to see this in
[00:19:11.110] Is like Hollywood Or like famous people There's often times comments like Oh, this person won the breakup Because check out who their next partner was I guess I just disagree with the concept of The hotter person Maybe that's more of a male perspective
[00:19:29.110] But to me, I feel like the happier person Like wins the breakup I'm not saying that's like the end all be all Those are just dimensions Not the superficial guys I'd probably be a lot happier with a hotter person I think just like as humans
[00:19:45.110] That's like the first thing that your mind would jump to But there's so many other factors Maybe we're just cavemen Pretty lady Good word, win breakup No, I think that's definitely viable though It's like the easiest and most visual Conclusion I guess, right? But my counterpoint is like
[00:20:07.110] I feel like you can end up with a hot person Right after the breakup But then if that relationship ends And you're on to the next And it keeps looping over Where you're in these short relationships with hot people
[00:20:19.110] I would not be like that person won the breakup That would be like they won the battle but they lost It's a long game There's a lot of factors that come into play Going back to Crystal and Celebrities Pete Davidson's a fucking winner
[00:20:31.110] He went from hot person to hot person To hot person And he just keeps winning That guy is like a perpetrator He is not doing women well I'd say he's pretty fucking happy I think the end goal is just to be happy Ultimately yes
[00:20:51.110] It's sort of like Jisoo The external, internal If you post a hotter person On your story Then you're winning externally Internally also it's the happiness thing If you're just happier I do think that the whole idea of a winner Or loser is a very superficial concept
[00:21:09.110] So I think that's why the external part For me at least gets associated more with that And then the internal part You can't quantitatively measure that as well You can't for the other part either I think there's like Clarification has to be made There can be two winners
[00:21:25.110] There can be two losers That's a really good point I think in the long run The ideal is that you both become winners You keep winning Both of you Stay winning y'all It's a mentality thing I think it's definitely easy To maybe show Some sort of like
[00:21:51.110] I won in this area That person won in that area In the very beginning or earlier on Ultimately long term it's like Clearly everyone's over it And everyone became their own winners Hopefully Or you stay a loser forever That's the thing too
[00:22:11.110] It's like two years after a relationship You don't really care if you won or lost It's only the first couple months It's only on a superficial level Just in small superficial aspects I feel like in the long term If you're truly gonna stay a loser
[00:22:27.110] It would be like I let her go It would be like if you never had personal growth You didn't learn from the break up That is a good point If you just stayed yourself If you just stayed your old self And didn't take that opportunity to grow
[00:22:45.110] I think that's the biggest thing Learning from past mistakes Learning from past mistakes And being a better partner For your future relationships I think that's the ultimate way To say That's not even comparing at that point You're just doing it for yourself
[00:23:05.110] You're always winning if it's a stepping stone While you're leveling up every time Which is nice But yeah, you're a loser if you're just staying at the bottom You're just dog piling on the losers It's kind of funny to just say loser
[00:23:21.110] That word doesn't get thrown out of there I think the real loser of a break up though Going back to what really divides The winner and the loser Is the person who takes longer to get over it Which is why I never thought about it
[00:23:37.110] In the hotter person's eyes I was just like, oh this person is over it faster Maybe they're happier with friends And this person is sad for life Okay, no that makes sense That's a good way to judge it too It's more conceptual than a race
[00:23:57.110] So I guess continuing on the topic of Who is a winner and who is a loser I feel like one of the things that tends to happen Post break ups Is that people are more emotional Maybe you're more open and willing to do new things
[00:24:09.110] And I feel like at least In my experience That has led me to do some mildly questionable things That I regret after a break up So have you guys ever had experiences like that Where post break up you do something You're like fuck it
[00:24:23.110] And then later you're like, okay I was on some Break up energy shit There probably are things But I maybe repressed them Maybe I don't regret them I don't think I've truly regretted anything Maybe some questionable DMs But okay, that's probably it Quite questionable DMs
[00:24:45.110] You don't regret them though You're just putting up shots You gotta put up shots in the gym sometimes What do you mean questionable DM Like the content was questionable or the fact that you DMed These people is questionable? Both Okay so the second is
[00:25:01.110] It's all like people on dating apps mostly So definitely that The content, yeah, looking back Holy shit, sometimes I was I look back sometimes and I was like damn These girls match with me after I was So down bad I've done some crazy ass shit
[00:25:17.110] And I think now I've settled into A very comfortable, if it happens, it happens If it doesn't, it doesn't, you know So I feel like it's more confidence in myself I won't send as like fucking down bad shit Thankfully But yeah, nothing too serious I would say
[00:25:31.110] I feel like I've been mostly intentional With other stuff I feel it's the same for me I don't think I regret anything You know, like post breakup Because there's honestly like Sort of like a learning period You get a pass Right? After Alexa, I hoed out A lot
[00:25:53.110] No, I was a straight up ho for like Three months I was putting up insane numbers Jesus Christ Michael Jordan numbers 96 Bulls numbers Like dream team I don't regret it, you know Obviously I'm not in that point of my life anymore I feel like regret
[00:26:15.110] Is a wasted emotion A little philosophical Philosophical So I think it's Normal and very human to regret things But there's so many Things you can regret in life And I think it's natural to feel those things But like at the end of the day
[00:26:35.110] You do something that you look back on And you didn't think was true to yourself Or you didn't think There's reasons you regret it But I think you can also take something away from it And learn from that experience And not do it in the future
[00:26:49.110] Or be better about it I think in that sense, the regret doesn't last It's just kind of a short term emotion So I think I look At a lot of my decisions after like that Sure I regret it in the moment
[00:27:01.110] But I do a little bit more about myself And hopefully I won't repeat those mistakes And then just move on I'd say the regret still stands Especially for relationships I know there's a couple of girls Honestly, I should have stayed with her
[00:27:17.110] So more like regrets about the relationship Or how it ended Yeah exactly The fact that we're actually really compatible Is just I was in a place in my life Where I could do something about it I'm talking about three specific ones They all have boyfriends
[00:27:37.110] Three is a lot From different phases of my life One right after high school One during college I think if you're in a position where you can't do anything about it Not gonna put up shots I'm saying like if there is an actionable step
[00:27:55.110] That you can take on yourself I would have taken it Then there's no reason to regret something That's a good outlook I don't know if I had too many regrets Also my breakup happened When we were a little more experienced Mature, older It was just less likely maybe
[00:28:17.110] To go out and do stupid decisions It was more like Hey let's just chill at home Have fun time with friends There was less room Or potential for Stupid decisions at that time So I don't have any Big regrets that come to mind
[00:28:35.110] I feel like I have a lot We saved the best for last But they're really fucking old I don't even know if it's still relevant I feel like it's more associated with age Than maybe it was about the actual breakup
[00:28:49.110] I guess one of the things that I remember About the periods of time Where I had breakups I just had such low self-esteem And I feel like that makes you do things That are maybe not Something that will serve your interests In the long run
[00:29:05.110] Things that you don't really want to do So I feel like some of my post-breakup phases I was very attention seeking From men And then I kind of regret that period I feel like I could have been Maybe trying to build more on myself Or work on myself
[00:29:21.110] And turn more internal But instead I was like, oh it's super easy To get attention from guys So I'll just turn outwards and do that Which is not very fulfilling in the long run It all ended up okay But one of the things that I definitely regret
[00:29:35.110] Was after one breakup I reached out to someone I used to talk to in the past And then we met up It was really meh So then I was like, why did I even do that? There was no purpose Really all I wanted was
[00:29:51.110] Someone there for that one time But it's so meaningless And it's like rehashing old shit It's just like, why? This is really old tea When you have low self-esteem And you want easy gratification And it's easy to find that Then you just lean into that
[00:30:09.110] And I feel like forget other things that are important But they were learning moments for you, right? Yeah, definitely And I think you also actually learn from previous breakups You know, this is the easy path But if I take this, I'll feel like shit in two months
[00:30:21.110] Versus this is the hard way And I'll focus on myself And I'll be fine in four months So I'm sure you build upon that knowledge Oh, but there is one thing That I feel like It wasn't necessarily regret But it was something that I grappled with
[00:30:37.110] Right after a breakup I felt kind of emotionally numb for a while I was pretty disinterested In meeting new people And I was pretty disinterested In forming new connections Because it was like, damn, that's a lot of work And maybe it was the anticipation Of in the future
[00:30:55.110] If I were to have another boyfriend I would have to go through all this work To get to know them And build this thing all up again So I definitely had a period of time Where I was just emotionally numb I really couldn't care less for random people
[00:31:09.110] Was that romantically too? Or also just friend-wise? Like socially, meeting new people I think it was mostly romantically And then in terms of Meeting new people It like wavered Sometimes I was like, I don't have the energy to do this today But then sometimes I was like, okay
[00:31:27.110] Maybe I'll try to meet some friends Yeah, I can definitely empathize with that Because I feel like the hurt That you feel either during the breakup Or sometimes for a lot of women Especially, I feel like it's before You're like deliberating about it for so long
[00:31:43.110] You're just emotionally spent And then you no longer have any energy To put towards that So I feel like it's natural to just be like, okay, whatever I'm checked out for the time being Yeah, I mean there's a term for that, right? Like emotionally unavailable
[00:31:57.110] Oh shit, you're right It's a big thing Yeah, it was like when I was in my ho phase There was honestly a good amount of girls That I could have actually started something Long-term with them But then the fact that I was emotionally unavailable It never happened
[00:32:15.110] And they honestly get the gist After like a month or two months Like, okay, this guy This guy's a bad boy He's not good for me This guy isn't getting more and more emotionally Aware of everything else They sniff it out after a month
[00:32:35.110] I think for me, I wasn't Emotionally numb I think I got jaded I went on a lot of first dates I was like, damn, this fucking shit sucks It's a lot of the same conversations You kind of sense out whether or not
[00:32:51.110] You would hit it off with them after a couple conversations And then after you do that cycle Of meeting someone, matching with someone Meeting up with them Talking first date or two It gets very repetitive And you lose a little bit of hope I guess
[00:33:09.110] So you're like, fuck, I don't want to go through that again But I feel like I'm still hopeful After that experience There was a stretch of a month Where I went on 7 or 8 dates It was just a lot
[00:33:27.110] I think I had the energy for it at the time But it really drained me after After that, I was like, damn I probably won't take out everybody Because I know I'm able to But I gotta be a little more selective A little more intentional
[00:33:41.110] So it's definitely slowed down a lot since then I don't think I've been on too many dates since then For better or for worse Maybe I should be putting myself a little more out there But I don't want to waste my time Or someone else's time
[00:33:55.110] If over text, I can already sense that Things aren't going to work out Going with your gut feeling Yeah, I think so You get a sense for it too Some of these people on dating apps are like fucking robots So boring NPCs They're literally NPCs
[00:34:13.110] Yeah, I feel like dating apps is pretty tough Because it's just like The only way kind of right now So it's so much stuff you have to Filter through And there's kind of I feel like girls Are really The worst on apps
[00:34:31.110] I know that there's a ton of people Who complain about Bumble Because the girl is supposed to start the conversation But they just say like, hi Yeah, that's just the worst There's so much low effort out there I will say Honestly, it's reasonable
[00:34:47.110] Because the guy experience is so drastically different I wrote a fucking analogy Let me pull it up on my phone The guy experience is so So different from the girl experience I wrote this If a girl finding love on Hinge can be compared
[00:35:01.110] To sifting through countless pebbles and dirt In a river in hopes for gold A guy finding love on Hinge Is like the river eroding the earth over millennia To send that gold downstream In hopes its sparkle will allow it to be Uncovered by the one
[00:35:15.110] It's a very different experience Because girls have hella likes coming in all the time So they have to sift through that Guys have to really work on themselves To make themselves stand out You have to be in a sea of fucking likes
[00:35:27.110] How are you going to stick out as a profile That they just see for an instant Bro, these girls have like hundreds of fucking likes It's actually crazy The experience is very very different Because as a guy you're constantly putting yourself out there
[00:35:39.110] Every time I'm like, I want this first date with you That's crazy How did I stand out? I didn't say anything Especially interesting or anything It's like wow It's also very emotionally draining You constantly have to put yourself out there But then for girls it's also like
[00:35:57.110] You see so many mid profiles It's also probably really draining for them too There's two sides of it I feel like people get really jaded Really tired That's why you probably see a lot of low effort I feel like I try to put in
[00:36:11.110] Effort where I see it now If it's reciprocated That's a very clear signal If it's not, you can't make someone else Put more effort in Just move on I still think girls can do better I agree Put in a little more energy I actually feel like our generation
[00:36:31.110] Specifically us plus or minus a couple years Are going to really shape what online dating looks like For the future Because we're the first real users of the apps I know the websites and stuff existed But the internet culture has evolved so much
[00:36:45.110] So you guys should send feedback And try to actually shape the app world I have so much feedback If I ever get fired from my job I'm going to make a dating app I'll make it so much better than Hinge and Bumble Because it's such a bad experience
[00:37:01.110] I think it needs to be Both sides get rewarded for putting in effort Somehow there needs to be a way to do that Because it's tough I think Sure girls have to sift through stuff But that doesn't make up for Girls just expecting guys To carry the conversation
[00:37:23.110] You should pull your weight too Because that's also how a relationship works The worst part is It's low effort because people know they have Hella options out there They could be like Let me match with this guy But I have 500 other likes That I can go through
[00:37:41.110] And I don't have to put that much effort in Because I know I have all this interest in me So I'm not going to be like Yeah she's not replying so I'll just move on It's a constant cycle I feel like that's very damaging Mentally and emotionally
[00:37:55.110] I feel like as a guy you gotta actually Shape different strats too For real, for me You sound like Diabolical Not on some Diabolical shit But it's just like For my strat When a girl replies I'd have to reply immediately My strat was I'd reply immediately
[00:38:15.110] And obviously she would reply I would try to get at least one conversation That's actually good Because it's so fucking hard To have a conversation If you miss a few hours they couldn't not check the app for a few days And then there's a sea of other likes
[00:38:29.110] And they'll just miss you You're buried in that sea You gotta really hit the sweet spot But also you can't seem too fucking desperate Because if you reply right away dude No I agree You probably have to You gotta throw away your desperation Insecurities there
[00:38:47.110] Because you just have to Reply to her when she's on the app Or else she's probably never gonna reply again Fuck I should've replied faster Dude that sucks I feel like apps just Magnify the games that people play Especially But I feel like that's so Stupid
[00:39:07.110] I don't want to deal with I don't want to deal with it I lowkey have an idea that could be genius Or it could be troll as fuck So my mom was telling me About the dating culture back in the day In Korea
[00:39:21.110] And what they used to do was set up 3-3 single dates Sort of so it's kind of like speed dating But in a controlled 6 people kind of environment And what that does is you're kind of talking live To each other And then you also are not just thinking
[00:39:37.110] Oh is this person right for me But you probably are thinking Is this person the best out of these 3 people Which helps you narrow down the options a little bit It's a little bit less nebulous What if there's a love triangle situation There could be
[00:39:51.110] But the thing is And I feel like It maybe makes the women Compete a little bit too Oh true That is pretty good Both sides putting their best selves There needs to be a little more effort on all ends I thought of another idea
[00:40:09.110] What if in the app you have A minute to respond Or else you just lose a person Like on both ends You're like I'm going to start a conversation right now And then the timer counts down Once you send it
[00:40:23.110] Don't put all these ideas on the fucking phone I'm trying to Or it's like Omegle You can only talk to one person I've been thinking about that a lot It's a good way of looking at it Then you really have to be selective Be intentional
[00:40:39.110] Otherwise just move on to the next one I think the intentionality Is the most important part Some people are on there to Give validation A sea of likes They're just being pen pals I know where that term is from But yeah People have different intents
[00:40:59.110] When it comes to these apps Sometimes those intents don't match up If you're looking to seriously date It's just a matter of Sifting through all the options To find someone that has the same mentality Which can be really tiring I think you really have to limit the options
[00:41:15.110] Because there's just option fatigue It's hard to make a decision When there's so many In the Bay Area too There's so many guys You'll have a better time in New York All those dates happen in New York Try to do it I've gotten off of the dating apps
[00:41:35.110] And now I'm just trying to do organic shit He's really happy bro Trying to be there in life He's on the dating apps, he's living life Off the dating apps Organic, meet friends of friends I'm also idealistic I kind of want to brush up on
[00:41:51.110] A girl passing by And then just start a conversation Romantic It's like a Hallmark movie Yeah you know like fingers fucking just Jimmy's got hopes It hasn't happened yet It's been like a year Things are looking a little bleak So it hasn't happened yet
[00:42:11.110] It's not a good strat I have hope on the dating apps still I feel like one day I'll wake up And there'll be a little like There are success stories I got hope, I got mad hope It's dwindling a little bit
[00:42:25.110] I feel like sometimes taking a break too Helps rekindle the hope You're like I'm improved now I'm confident Not constantly But every once in a while Refreshing the profile, keeping it nice Making sure it fully represents you I feel like that's a little activity too
[00:42:43.110] Some people don't give a fuck on their profile It's like what's one thing you want to do this year Travel What would make you fall for me Oh if you have a dog Oh man yeah When I see that shit My blood pressure rises
[00:42:59.110] Why are you on Hinge? To delete it Oh my god bro God damn What's your ideal hangout Some boba The worst is What makes you different Or some shit It's like I actually know where I want to eat That's a fucking Bare minimum response man
[00:43:21.110] Girls have they know where to want to eat All these girls know where to want it Be honest though You're still fucking shooting your shot I'm still shooting my shot All I have to do is look cute and I'll shoot my shot The worst part it gets rewarded
[00:43:35.110] All these guys reward this behavior Yeah you're rewarded I'm doing it as part of the problem So it's a tried true method Why as a girl Are you going to try It's a good word in the DMs It's a repeating cycle Self fulfilling prophecy Oh yeah
[00:43:59.110] This has nothing to do with breakups I feel It does The whole app culture is a big part of Not necessarily just breakups too But the whole What you do after a breakup How people interact with each other How people meet each other Are from breakups Yeah
[00:44:23.110] Almost like a prerequisite I've seen some Couples looking for a third I feel like a good amount of them are Even freshly broken up people I've come across a fair share of those And it's also you kind of serve as their It's not fun
[00:44:47.110] I was about to say that's therapeutic for that To all the listeners out there Please go on the apps when you're actually ready to date I'm not trying to be your therapist But he will be I've done it and I'm still I'm not proud of it but like
[00:45:03.110] Seriously take the time you need to heal Eddie will be there to reassure you I'll still be there to be a shoulder you can cry on Please I'm running out of energy for this And I think it's also totally okay
[00:45:19.110] To be like I think I'm ready to go on the apps Go on the apps and then be like You know what actually I don't think I'm ready And then just leave I think a lot of girls too This might be for different reasons
[00:45:31.110] Download the app, they'll delete it later on Redownload it Maybe that's part of fatigue I think there's also a more diabolical If you remake your account You get put to the front That's true Holy shit Diabolical hinge mechanics There's some crazy algorithms I got some strats
[00:45:53.110] I remember when I moved to the bay When I moved back New location and everything I think they shot my profile up And I was like holy shit I don't know what to do It's like a boost Would you say it's like sifting in a river
[00:46:09.110] Like through pebbles and stuff Or eroding I'm not gonna lie the bay area Choices Grim Basically the saying is that In the bay The odds are good The odds are good but the goods are odd The odds are good But the goods are odd
[00:46:31.110] I must say I'm a pretty odd good And then the thing in New York In New York because there's less girls So the odds are bad But the goods are good Wait I'm gonna need to hear that again Or I guess To flip it would be like
[00:46:49.110] The odds are Anyway It's basically flip In the bay the odds are good but the goods are odd In New York it's the opposite This is from a girl perspective right That's interesting because it's flipped for the guy Okay I have a final question for us all
[00:47:05.110] Have you ever regretted a breakup Not for me Are you saying in the long run Just like in general Yeah like in the long run probably No not for me My really short term dating Like I said earlier right I do have some regrets there
[00:47:23.110] But if I've given it time You know like multi-year relationships Then no No Yeah Not really for me I did once regret the time period that I broke up Oh I see Cause it was like finals week And I was like maybe I should have waited
[00:47:43.110] Sorry I couldn't wait You probably didn't really study much But also I feel like sometimes a breakup can't wait Like you're just sitting there suffering For the sake of the other person Yes that's true cause it's like self-sacrificial If you choose to wait I think I agree though
[00:47:59.110] I also don't regret any breakups Which is good that means that we've all Learned and grown from our breakups Yeah I would say so I feel like you only regret it If you're the one that did the breaking up And like it was for a really stupid reason
[00:48:13.110] Yeah That's the only time really Well this has been an actually pretty long journey In terms of us physically being here In our living room Talking through all of our past breakups But it's been really enlightening And it's actually been a pretty positive And encouraging conversation
