[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Yane.
[00:00:17.370] So welcome back, Yane. You might recognize her voice from past episodes that we've done,
[00:00:22.490] and I think the most recent one was episode 156, Modeling and Photoshoots. So go check that out if
[00:00:28.990] you want to hear about Yane's experience being a model and doing photoshoots in the community.
[00:00:34.670] Today we have on Yane for a very interesting topic, which is the Asian American Identity.
[00:00:41.870] As big of a topic as this is, I feel like there have been various ways that Asian American
[00:00:48.190] identities have been represented, whether it's through specific celebrity archetypes or even
[00:00:53.490] those mass videos where people would actually go in and dissect these microcategories.
[00:00:58.790] I also want to say before we dive into this topic, this is obviously a topic that has been
[00:01:04.850] heavily discussed outside of even just our podcast, and it's a complex one. It's not easy to really draw
[00:01:10.210] lines when we talk about the Asian American identity, especially since there's so many
[00:01:14.270] different communities and groups within the big community of Asian American. So just want to put
[00:01:20.890] it out there that we're going to be discussing our personal thoughts, our personal viewpoints,
[00:01:25.270] and our feelings, and we are imperfect people. So just know that before we dive into this episode.
[00:01:31.990] Let's start this off by talking about the evolution of the Asian identity.
[00:01:36.770] How do you think this way of representing us or identifying has evolved over the years?
[00:01:42.790] First of all, go Asians.
[00:01:44.810] Woo!
[00:01:46.930] Yeah. And I think in terms of mainstream media representation, there's like a difference between
[00:01:53.130] Asian representation and then Asian American representation, right? So in terms of Asian
[00:01:57.670] American, I feel like the main representation we had, am I saying representation too much?
[00:02:02.070] The main rep we had was like non-mainstream, like alternative media channels like YouTube,
[00:02:09.310] right? So there are a lot of YouTube creators like Jimmy Cocoa Puffs, like My Chani.
[00:02:13.010] Disney. I'm trying to give some more niche examples other than like, you know, Nigahiga,
[00:02:18.230] like Kev Jamba, Wong Fu Productions, right? Yeah, that shit was fire.
[00:02:21.910] Nowadays, we have a lot more mainstream representation, right? We got Disney, bro. Shout out Shang-Chi.
[00:02:28.990] Oh my God.
[00:02:30.210] We're on the map. We got Squid Games. Squid Games fire. Wait, that's still Korean.
[00:02:35.390] That's Asian, I didn't mean. But a lot of Americans watched it.
[00:02:40.570] Yeah, so there's levels to it. But it's definitely a lot more visibility now. It's a good time. Songs are up.
[00:02:46.170] I will say with how Asians are sometimes represented in TV, makes me laugh a little bit. So I think it's
[00:02:52.950] gotten a lot better now. But occasionally, there'll be times where I'm watching like a mainstream
[00:02:57.970] American TV show, and there's an Asian character. My first instinct is always like, oh, yeah,
[00:03:02.870] there's an Asian person. And then my second instinct is like, okay, they are trying to adhere to that
[00:03:07.650] Asians represent X percent of the community statistic too much. Like there's only one Asian allowed.
[00:03:13.090] And that's it. Because that's what the like quota is. So I think it's been getting better. But
[00:03:18.090] occasionally, I'm just like, oh, that's the token Asian character.
[00:03:20.950] The issue is that Asians actually move in packs. And so they need to have like five of them.
[00:03:26.530] Wait, that's low-key true.
[00:03:27.750] Yeah, to be realistic, it should be like that.
[00:03:30.990] Have you guys heard of the movie Interior Chinatown that's coming out soon?
[00:03:35.490] It was like originally book first. Yeah.
[00:03:37.850] Yeah, I think it actually talks about a lot of stereotypes like that. And it's super meta.
[00:03:42.070] So I'm really excited for that coming out. Just wanted to plug it. You should check it out.
[00:03:47.430] Actually, I also wanted to mention I do feel like in the 90s and the 2000s,
[00:03:53.150] I do feel like Asian American representation was almost better in some ways. Because like you said,
[00:04:00.530] now it's sort of a token minority. They're trying to make sure they hit that market, right? And appeal
[00:04:05.390] to the market. But back then, it was very much, I don't see color, which is problematic in its own
[00:04:12.150] way, right? That's very problematic. But because of that, they would just sort of casually have Asian
[00:04:17.270] American actors and characters and they wouldn't make it a moment, right?
[00:04:21.270] I was watching like Independence Day on the 4th of July this year. And they just had an Asian guy
[00:04:25.650] in like the first five minutes and it was just casual. He was like part of the team. And I was
[00:04:29.370] like, whoa, actually, like the way we even do representation. Did we go backwards? I don't
[00:04:35.130] know. It's changed. It's evolved a lot. That's interesting because I feel like sometimes watching
[00:04:40.190] older movies can be kind of a jump scare on like, oh, wow, we've come a long way. Because I recently
[00:04:45.690] watched Fast and Furious, the second one, Tokyo Drift. Bits in that, I was just like, bro,
[00:04:50.910] like how did this get past multiple editors, multiple publishing people? People actually
[00:04:57.190] had to sign off on this. Some of the accents or, you know, other elements I felt like was kind of
[00:05:02.670] not something that we would consider appropriate now. But I think what we were talking about earlier,
[00:05:07.670] sometimes I'll watch a TV show and the token Asian character is the doctor or something. And
[00:05:12.610] I'm just like, dude, why are we still doing this? Dude, the like biggest pioneer of Asian
[00:05:19.430] representation was definitely Brenda Song, London Tipton. She broke like all the stereotypes too.
[00:05:26.170] Yo, Wendy Wu, Coming Warrior, let's go. At least nowadays in movies, they cast the right
[00:05:34.910] ethnicity for the acting role. It used to be like, this guy is kind of East Asian, whatever. Like,
[00:05:42.530] let's just put a put a Chinese accent on him. He's Chinese now. Yeah, which is pretty problematic.
[00:05:49.130] That's true. I think we've finally started to move away from like accents a little more.
[00:05:55.090] Do you think so? Because we also have like Uncle Roger. And I actually find that people in America
[00:06:01.810] don't like his whole accent thing. But then people in Asia think he's so funny. I was like, okay,
[00:06:08.430] maybe like, I think this is offensive. But maybe that's just from my perspective, right? Yeah.
[00:06:13.610] Actually, I think that's a very important distinction. Because I'll still watch some
[00:06:17.950] comedians in Korea, for example. And they still do a lot of shit that I'm just like, this would not
[00:06:23.290] fly in America. But even if what is considered there might be considered racist here, the reality
[00:06:29.190] is it's just such a different culture, which doesn't make it not racist. But the cultural
[00:06:33.830] context is just completely different. So I think just like the context does make or break the situation
[00:06:39.430] a lot. But oftentimes, as Americans, I think it's hard for us to kind of grasp that since a lot of
[00:06:45.010] what we think is so America centric. That's true. I think also, though, we maybe hate it because
[00:06:51.770] they're clumping us into this generalization that like, Asians sound like this when they speak English.
[00:06:56.930] But we're like, we're Asian, but we do not have an accent. So that is offensive to us. But then
[00:07:03.010] maybe for other people, actual Asians abroad, they're like, oh, haha, that's hella funny. Because
[00:07:08.010] like, that is how we sound. And like, we can relate to that. Because that's what I hear every day.
[00:07:12.610] Yeah, I do think the lumping up at all is what really makes it offensive. Because like you said, for us,
[00:07:19.510] it's like not every Asian sounds like that. And this is so like overdone in the US. But maybe for people
[00:07:24.210] in Asia, it's like, oh, people from this country do this or like, you know, they're able to appreciate
[00:07:28.850] the nuances of different cultures and different ethnicities more.
[00:07:32.810] In terms of understanding Asian American dynamics, it's honestly really complex, because there's just
[00:07:41.430] so many different types of Asians, right? For example, like, I'm generalizing here, we're like
[00:07:46.030] all first, second generation here, right? So we were either born in Asia, or our parents were born in
[00:07:51.250] Asia. And we came here when we were really young. And we came during the 90s tech boom, when they were
[00:07:56.030] trying to increase immigration. And there's a lot of like H1B when we uses and stuff for tech.
[00:08:01.730] So that's sort of our context, right? I'm generalizing here. So let me know if I'm wrong.
[00:08:05.410] But so a lot of us grew up in like, what's it called? And like the sort of like tech, like our
[00:08:09.870] parents are slightly more white collar than what it was in like the freaking 60s, right? Like post
[00:08:16.290] Chinese exclusion acts type shit, right? So yeah, like our understanding of being Asian and stuff like
[00:08:22.790] that is totally different. Like when I went to high school, it was a very like academic Asian high
[00:08:28.130] school. And when I brought my lunch to school, and it was what my mom cooked me, my friends would be
[00:08:34.190] like, yo, like, is that squid? Like, let me try some of that, right? Which is crazy anywhere else. And so
[00:08:41.790] I sort of grew up in the bubble here. It was an interesting upbringing. I appreciate it a lot. But
[00:08:46.630] yeah, definitely still a bubble.
[00:08:48.330] You know, I actually saw a TikTok recently. That was really funny to me because it was an Asian American.
[00:08:55.970] And she was like, yeah, I grew up in the Midwest and it's different there, right?
[00:08:59.890] And she was like, low key, the Asian Americans who grow up in California are like the amount of
[00:09:08.230] privilege they have. It's like they're almost white. And in this bubble, at least, you know,
[00:09:14.310] in the California bubble. And I was like, oh my god, she low key has a point because there is like
[00:09:19.890] less shame attached to a lot of things that we grew up with. We could express our interest in
[00:09:26.070] certain things and other people would understand versus, you know, them questioning and being like,
[00:09:30.750] that's weird or whatever. I think we still experienced a bit of that in like, because we
[00:09:35.750] started being connected to the internet and it was some more outreach there. But all in all, like,
[00:09:41.110] in the Bay Area where we were, it was like a pretty safe space to express your Asian-ness.
[00:09:46.270] And I feel like that's like the most interesting part about being an Asian American right now is like,
[00:09:51.930] we are able to have different ways to dissect our identity. And sometimes I think about how
[00:09:58.470] I feel like I can relate way more to NorCal Asian Americans than SoCal Koreans, for example.
[00:10:06.550] You know, but if you think about it, like, oh, you know, I'm Korean American. So
[00:10:11.690] you would think that all Korean Americans across the board would have more to relate about. But at
[00:10:16.990] the end of the day, I feel like growing up Asian American in the Bay Area is like a very specific
[00:10:21.690] type of experience. And I can relate more to people who have shared that experience with me versus
[00:10:27.230] people who might have the same ethnic background as me and the same cultural background, but just grew
[00:10:32.210] up in like a different type of area. And it's so weird because SoCal is like a five hour drive away.
[00:10:38.990] It's like a 40 minute flight. So it's like, why do I feel that difference so stark? But I still do
[00:10:45.110] because SoCal has a lot of Koreans and NorCal definitely has a lot of Koreans, but we're not
[00:10:51.050] like the majority ethnic group. Whereas some pockets of SoCal might have Koreans be the majority ethnic
[00:10:56.650] group. So it's like all these things where I don't want to slice and dice it the way that I am,
[00:11:02.250] but I feel like I end up doing it anyway. It's like little microbiomes.
[00:11:07.570] Yeah.
[00:11:08.890] As long as you treat people like individuals, like stereotypes are how we make our understanding
[00:11:14.150] of the world to a certain extent, right? You were mentioning SoCal versus NorCal Asians,
[00:11:19.770] like the Korean community and stuff. I was actually chatting with my friend who's from SoCal. She loves
[00:11:25.630] SoCal and she was saying you can really feel the income inequality in NorCal, but in SoCal sort of
[00:11:33.310] feels like everybody, no matter what your parents do or what you do, sort of hangs out. And there's
[00:11:38.430] like a lot more feelings of diversity rather than in NorCal. It's mostly like mainland Chinese,
[00:11:44.450] right? She was saying like she misses SoCal a lot.
[00:11:46.910] I think there's a good amount of Taiwanese people up here too. But yeah, it ends up being
[00:11:50.270] like Chinese people, I think are the majority.
[00:11:54.630] Right. There's also like shout out to the Viet community, shout out to the Hmong community,
[00:11:58.470] shout out to the Philippines, the Philippines, and everyone else. It's less nervously. There's
[00:12:03.070] a Japanese community too. Oh gosh. I gotta shout everyone else out. But yeah.
[00:12:10.210] The only thing I know about like SoCal Asians or like SoCal Koreans is like the freaking LA riots,
[00:12:15.150] bro. That sounds crazy. Yeah. And I think the interesting thing too is I feel like Asian American
[00:12:23.110] identity has evolved far beyond just ethnicity now. And I see like pockets of Asian American identity
[00:12:30.570] and different archetypes that we see. So one example is like the Asians that love to rape.
[00:12:38.590] Another one is like the Asians that love to game. And I think there's a lot of overlap in between these
[00:12:44.270] identities. But for a lot of people, I feel like this becomes a really big part of how they present
[00:12:50.770] themselves and how they like interact with the world around them. And it's cool to see like these
[00:12:56.470] bubbles form within the community. And it's not just like, oh, Korean Americans, like Chinese Americans,
[00:13:01.670] like it's not just that anymore, you know? Yeah, it's pretty interesting how hard we like
[00:13:07.190] micro categorize ourselves. We pick out like one trait and we're suddenly we're like, you know what,
[00:13:13.670] that trait is going to become this group's like identity. And we're going to stereotype everything
[00:13:18.270] based on that. And I actually had an interesting thought. I was like, what if us micro categorizing
[00:13:24.850] ourselves is a trauma response to us getting lumped together all the time by general society?
[00:13:33.910] You know how in the past, like you were saying, Gain, people would just kind of lump us together,
[00:13:38.950] maybe get the wrong ethnicities when they're, I don't know, casting for TV or something,
[00:13:42.770] or just in general, right? And now we're like, no, we're different. And so we just micro categorize
[00:13:48.010] ourselves hella hard. Is anybody else like raving? Valorant? Boba? I like all these things.
[00:13:55.870] But yeah, you guys bring up a really good point because yeah, it's weird that we like categorize
[00:14:00.830] ourselves and stereotype ourselves so hard in an attempt to be different. Oh, yeah, there's some
[00:14:07.110] irony there for sure. But I do think it's kind of nice because we've broken out of the Asian people
[00:14:13.990] just do STEM or whatever. So there is more representation, even if it might still be a
[00:14:19.390] little bit reductive, right? They call it like boba liberalism, like the type of modern Asian.
[00:14:24.690] Oh my gosh, I have so many complex feelings about that stuff. Because on one hand, it is nice to have
[00:14:30.810] different representation. On the other hand, now, if you want to be quote unquote, cool,
[00:14:35.250] you have to do these things. Actually, wait, on the topic of raving, I also wanted to mention
[00:14:40.410] Asian people love raving so much that when you go to there's a really big festival here
[00:14:45.950] called Head in the Clouds. They will always have one EDM artist. And he's just some very talented
[00:14:53.470] white dude, right? Like they'll have like a millennium or Zen. But like the Asian people claim him
[00:15:00.130] will like claim whatever DJ is on. And it's I think it's so funny.
[00:15:04.230] Oh my god, I always see TikToks of like people at the raves. The caption is the great Asian migration
[00:15:12.110] from like a millennium to Zed or something like that. And then it just shows this giant wave of
[00:15:18.570] Asians walking to the next set. And I was like, oh my god, this is like, it fits the stereotype like all
[00:15:26.370] the Asian ravers love like these DJs or whatever.
[00:15:30.390] And you know, I thought Elenium was Asian for the longest time.
[00:15:34.690] Really?
[00:15:34.910] Because I feel like I've only heard Asian people talk about him versus someone like Zed.
[00:15:38.770] Like I know he's a big DJ because I see everyone across the board talk about him.
[00:15:43.410] So I was shocked to find out he was white.
[00:15:46.030] I think it's so funny how much Asian people love melodic bass.
[00:15:50.130] That is 100% like you said, a trauma response. Because okay, I love Elenium and all these artists
[00:15:57.450] and stuff and whatever. But when I go to these events, literally people have their arms outstretched
[00:16:02.710] to the heavens as beautiful melodic bass, like all these heavenly chords play. And I'm like,
[00:16:09.230] is this church?
[00:16:10.670] Like, are we guys are we worshiping right now? Like, are we spiritual right now? And then the DJ is like,
[00:16:16.910] like, if you feel compelled, you know, if you're here with the ones you love. I'm like,
[00:16:21.790] I'm like, oh my god, it feels like I'm back in church from like when I was young. Like,
[00:16:25.490] this is crazy.
[00:16:27.430] It's so true.
[00:16:28.430] I'm just trying to feel something, I guess.
[00:16:29.590] And then people are like, oh my god, like this DJ changed my life.
[00:16:34.130] Yeah.
[00:16:35.890] But I do think raving is like a good way to break out of maybe if you had a more restrictive,
[00:16:42.050] like childhood, or you want to get out of being like, quote unquote, like nerdy or like whatever,
[00:16:48.890] right? I think raving is a good way to express that side of yourself. Just don't make it your whole
[00:16:53.790] personality. You know, the world's big. There's a lot of things to enjoy. So that's my think piece on
[00:16:59.370] that. Well, I actually have two takes about the whole like, why do we, you know, dive into these
[00:17:05.890] micro categories things so much? And one is like, yes, I feel like there's definitely a push pull of
[00:17:11.770] at one point, we were all lumped into like, oh, you guys are just Asian, and therefore x, y and z
[00:17:16.990] kind of like traits apply to you. So then I feel like when something like that happens to a community,
[00:17:22.170] it starts to divide the community a lot, where it's like, oh, I'm not like that person. Why are you
[00:17:26.670] lumping me in with that person? Like here are the reasons why we're different. You recover from
[00:17:32.250] that by reuniting again, and being like, oh, guys, here are all the reasons why, you know, we should
[00:17:38.930] be a community again, because we like boba, we like raving, like you start to find easy reasons to not
[00:17:44.190] hate each other, because you're in the same community anyway. But then when that happens,
[00:17:49.410] you start to see the critiques in that too. So like the boba liberalism critique, where it's like,
[00:17:54.990] why do we hang on to these niche specific things and make that our whole identity? So then you start
[00:18:00.490] to break out again, right? It's like, oh, I'm different in this community because of this. But
[00:18:05.790] then also at the same time, because we have to affix that like Asian label towards the end,
[00:18:10.630] maybe that makes it seem more like an issue when it doesn't really have to be.
[00:18:14.310] Preach. But I don't know, because like, when I think about raving Asians,
[00:18:18.110] they really make it their personality. Like they deep dive into that shit. They have like merch from
[00:18:26.230] their favorite DJs. They're like obsessed with them. That's like all they listen to just EDM.
[00:18:31.230] And like, that's all they talk about too. So I think maybe there's like an element of both sides,
[00:18:37.230] you know, where it's like one, we are kind of categorizing ourselves within our community. But
[00:18:45.590] the people buy into it. And they're like, yeah, fuck it. I'm an Asian raver now. So then they like
[00:18:50.430] make it their personality. It's like co-opted by the people who are like trying to find their
[00:18:55.830] personality. Yeah.
[00:18:57.630] Do you think Asian people in extremely generally speaking, have more of a communal aspect than
[00:19:05.150] maybe the traditional non POC Asian, right? So I think we're slightly more susceptible to like
[00:19:11.290] cult behavior. Just putting it out there. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not a
[00:19:16.310] scientist here. Like group behavior. Group behavior. There you go. That's a way better way to put it.
[00:19:20.670] Thank you so much. Yeah. We're more susceptible to group behavior. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to say
[00:19:24.690] I've also been to the pits of like the gaming, Asian gaming community. And I've been back, you know.
[00:19:31.250] It's an echo chamber. Like, don't get me wrong. Once again, like I love being basic. I love
[00:19:35.090] Valorite guys. I love League of Legends. I've given 10 years of my life. I'm qualified. But the way
[00:19:40.990] everybody sort of normalizes playing freaking hours of this game every day. And oh my gosh,
[00:19:48.130] don't even get me started on like e-dating on Valorant and stuff like that. Yeah. But it's just
[00:19:52.710] it's too broad of a topic. Pause. Dude, every time I see e-daters in my lobby, I fear for my life.
[00:20:00.170] Wait, what do you mean you see them in your lobby? They'll have like matching names, matching game
[00:20:05.110] tags, matching like banners, just like Ayn said. And then I just fear that they'll open their mouth
[00:20:10.950] and like say really, you know, cringe, like couple-y stuff. And I'm like, dude, we're just
[00:20:16.650] trying to play a game. It's like Maple Story all over again. It is. Oh my gosh. That's such a good
[00:20:24.630] connection. I went to Maple Fest one year in LA and it was literally all Asian people. Oh my god. And I
[00:20:30.310] was like, this explains everything. Yeah. I mean, it is literally a Korean game and also Maple Story is
[00:20:35.930] awesome. But I was like, oh, like, oh. Yeah. But I guess like to conclude the whole gaming community
[00:20:44.470] and stuff, I think it's awesome, right? There's like K-pop and Overwatch now and like Valorant also
[00:20:50.150] works with Asian artists and stuff like that. But ultimately, like it is an echo chamber. I mean,
[00:20:56.790] the company is doing it because, you know, they love their community, but also they want to make
[00:21:00.690] money. And then Asian people are like, oh my god, like this is literally how I talk to my friends
[00:21:08.150] every day. It just and then they're like, oh yeah, this is normal. And I'm like, honestly, okay,
[00:21:13.890] wait, I love gamers. Y'all are my people, but like also read a book. No hate, no hate. But it's like
[00:21:20.090] there's more things out there, you know? Well, I guess leaning into these personalities is also
[00:21:24.890] just more visible. It's like the hype train is there with like the raving Asians, the TikTok
[00:21:29.890] Asians, the Valorant Asians. And a lot of these people also exist on the streaming or like social
[00:21:35.910] media platforms too. So then you see them way more than, I don't know, the book club Asians or like
[00:21:41.970] the volleyball Asians. It's so hard to label like all of these things as like the Asians.
[00:21:49.330] Jisoo is a book club Asian. So am I dude, dab me up. Okay, but I also was thinking as we were,
[00:21:59.670] you know, talking this through, like, I would say us three are not necessarily in any specific
[00:22:07.310] micro category, but some other people truly are in a micro category. So I'll say for example,
[00:22:14.690] like, I also like playing Valorant, but I'm not like a Valorant Asian. And like, Yane, you know,
[00:22:20.330] she likes Valorant. She likes raving. She likes Boba, but she's not really like, she's not really
[00:22:26.170] like belonging to just one of those micro categories, right? Yeah. Wait, I'm sorry. Yane loves Boba.
[00:22:33.510] I was sending me. Yeah. Wait, you said that. I do. Shout out Taiwan. Yeah. And so I feel like
[00:22:41.290] you can definitely like a certain, you know, thing that's part of a certain subcategory,
[00:22:47.830] but like you yourself don't have to make it your whole personality. So I think there's definitely
[00:22:53.190] that split, right? There are certainly people who just really buy into it and like lead the charge
[00:22:58.650] for that subcategory. And then there's also other people who like dabble, but aren't fully immersed
[00:23:05.090] into a certain subcategory. That's a good point. To qualify as a Valorant Asian, there are like
[00:23:11.390] specific attributes that you must have. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think a lot of Asian American content
[00:23:18.190] creators, for example, will lean into these things. Actually, what Jesus said earlier is really
[00:23:23.490] interesting because like when other races follow trends, nobody's like, oh, this race trend. Ooh,
[00:23:30.990] right. Like, but then for Asian people, I do think we're a little bit hard on ourselves because when
[00:23:36.970] they do play into these niches, it's actually them expanding out of their worldview. It's just that
[00:23:42.730] we're a little bit more like, I don't want to say mature, but we've had more time to expand into
[00:23:50.510] a lot of different interests, right? So like right out of college, yeah, I went to a ton of raves,
[00:23:54.990] but then after that, it's like, oh, okay. I also like, I don't know. I also like D&D. I also like
[00:24:00.050] reading. Like I like art, like music, whatever. Right. I do think a lot of these people are either
[00:24:06.170] maybe younger or not really interested in a lot of other things. Yeah. Maybe it's like too fun.
[00:24:11.810] I don't know. This is it. That's all they need. You know? Like I do think Asian content creators,
[00:24:19.030] because they see these trends, they see the market, they see the easy audience to capture. I see them
[00:24:25.430] leaning into these things. For example, like there's a huge cultural discourse on like TikTok
[00:24:31.410] and Twitter and stuff like that, where people are criticizing the biggest Asian American creators.
[00:24:35.910] And they're like, you're holding Asian people back, like when they see your dives and stuff.
[00:24:40.690] But as a creator, it's very normal to lean into trends. And yeah, again, like other races don't
[00:24:46.310] get criticized for that as much, I feel like. So yeah, that's a really good point. Like we can't fault
[00:24:51.090] them. That's how they're going to make their money. That's how they're going to keep their
[00:24:55.090] audience's attention. It's been kind of proven that sometimes if you move away from what your audience
[00:25:01.850] expects, then you can expect to probably lose a good chunk of them because they're like, this is
[00:25:07.490] not what I came here for. I subscribed to see like Valorant content, but now suddenly you're just
[00:25:13.630] chatting at us, you know? So I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense that like, we can't just
[00:25:20.830] always look at creators to like pave the way because it's like their job. They just have to do what's
[00:25:27.430] going to be entertaining and successful for them. You know, this actually reminds me of like,
[00:25:32.830] I've seen this comment posted a lot on Korean articles sometimes where there will be a Korean
[00:25:39.130] person that does something that is bad, I guess to say in a general sense. For example, if there was
[00:25:46.230] some corruption uncovered in like the Korean government and it becomes like international
[00:25:50.170] news, right? A comment that I'll often see is like, oh, this is like an international embarrassment
[00:25:55.550] or this is like giving us global shame. Like you are bringing shame onto Korea. And I wonder if some
[00:26:01.750] of that sentiment is echoed in how we view like representation in the Asian American community,
[00:26:06.990] where we want someone to be like the face of the community. And if they do something that's bad,
[00:26:13.230] or maybe doesn't align with what I want the community to progress towards, we're like, oh,
[00:26:18.470] this is bad for the white gays or like this is bad in terms of other communities looking at our community.
[00:26:25.910] In a lot of ways, that's like unfair. And I guess I don't necessarily know if other communities are
[00:26:31.430] thinking that when they see big Asian creators, like are they necessarily saying, oh, this creator
[00:26:36.030] is like this. So therefore, the entire Asian community is like this. Like that's probably not
[00:26:40.590] necessarily true. But I do feel like it's a sentiment that is often echoed. It's like, oh, you're making
[00:26:45.870] the Asian community look bad. That's so true. Like it just falls onto this one person's shoulders when
[00:26:53.070] they didn't ask for it. Like they're just trying to make a living. And I guess it depends too,
[00:26:58.670] whether like this person is doing something truly like egregious that's just, you know,
[00:27:04.110] universally accepted as like wrong. But sometimes I see that criticism on, I don't know, like small
[00:27:10.150] stuff like, oh, this is embarrassing. Like take this down, bro. You're making the community look bad.
[00:27:14.410] Mm hmm. Oh, that's a lot of pressure. Yeah. I think that's so true. And I think it was very
[00:27:20.070] common. And I honestly think it's still kind of common in like media, right? Like in like Hollywood,
[00:27:25.410] like, oh my God, this one person basically represents the whole Asian community because
[00:27:30.330] they get to be on the big screen. But like they didn't ask for that. And like they should be allowed
[00:27:35.550] to still be themselves at the same time. It's hard because when we're thinking about it,
[00:27:41.050] sometimes it's like, well, that one person maybe is like the only representation that we're getting
[00:27:48.030] on the big screen or whatever. And so we're all relying on this, you know, this one figure,
[00:27:53.830] but like hopefully it gets better with more representation. I do feel like nowadays we get
[00:28:00.890] a little bit more representation in media. Maybe that huge weight of responsibility is lightening a bit,
[00:28:07.730] but I feel like I've heard that criticism a lot and the criticism of that criticism. That's like,
[00:28:13.250] hey, we can't just, you know, expect this one person to do all the heavy lifting for our one
[00:28:19.730] community. Right. First of all, I think, yeah, maybe we should just let people be like weird,
[00:28:26.270] let people be different. Right. But I saw on TikTok, there was this trend where even if someone's doing
[00:28:31.450] something a little bit weird, instead of like commenting anything mean on TikTok, they'll be like,
[00:28:35.710] who is this diva? Oh my God. Yeah. Or they'll say like, oh my God, do you do weddings?
[00:28:43.230] Oh my God. Which I think is like, it's just cute, right? Like just let people be a little bit quirky,
[00:28:48.290] I guess. Yeah. Yeah. My favorite is like a combo. It's like close enough. Do you do weddings?
[00:28:56.510] I think it's so funny. Maybe we should just let people be themselves more because I also felt
[00:29:02.930] growing up. I literally, I think Asian people struggle with this all the time. Like we're
[00:29:07.970] always like, oh, we don't fit in. I don't feel like we fit in. But it's like, who are we trying
[00:29:11.830] to fit into? Right. When I was growing up, I didn't feel like I fit in with the Korean fobs.
[00:29:16.530] And then I hang out with Korean Americans and then I'm like, I don't, they feel like I fit in with you
[00:29:20.030] either. I don't know. And then there's like ABGs and I'm like, I don't know how to be an ABG.
[00:29:23.850] I don't know how to look this bad. I'm sorry. Yeah. And then the Valorant people, I'm like,
[00:29:28.430] I love video games, but I don't know how to do this either. Right. So like, yeah, I feel like I
[00:29:34.050] carved my own way, but it was, it wasn't out of me being like, oh, like I'm different. It's like,
[00:29:38.270] oh God, I'm different. Like, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know how to, how to hang like this guys.
[00:29:42.990] I'm sorry. So I think I'm a diva. Okay, guys, this might be a little deep, but do you think this is
[00:29:50.270] just us becoming our parents because we see a certain micro subculture become successful and
[00:29:58.130] maybe success is defined in different ways. It's like, they have friends, they have fun,
[00:30:02.990] they're successful in their jobs, you know, any of those things. And so we are hard on ourselves
[00:30:08.270] because we're like, we need to do something that gets us up there too. And so it's easy to like put
[00:30:14.450] yourself into one of these like micro categorizations because you're like, if I do it this way,
[00:30:20.070] I'll be successful. Like those other people I see too. Yeah. I think it's like the sense of
[00:30:25.990] belonging aspect for sure. And maybe it's kind of like, oh, I don't feel like I am truly American
[00:30:32.570] because I'm not white. And then you go back to Korea and you're like, I don't feel like I'm
[00:30:35.870] truly Korean because they look at me funny when I'm there. And then you come back and you're like,
[00:30:40.850] guys, I'm a Valorant Asian. Like this is the community I choose.
[00:30:47.690] I also think it like it applies to us expecting like, you know, influencers or content creators
[00:30:54.530] or whatever people in the media to like uphold the community image because that's like kind of what
[00:31:00.890] your parents are doing with you, right? Or the stereotype, right? You're supposed to like do
[00:31:06.270] things that make your parents proud. So we're like almost expecting these people to represent us
[00:31:12.330] and make us proud. Yeah, that's true. Cause I was unemployed for like a year, but I was working
[00:31:18.750] on like Twitch streaming and blah, blah, blah. But I would have to tell Asian parents, I wouldn't tell
[00:31:24.330] them like, oh, I'm unemployed. I would be like, oh, I'm a freelance entrepreneur, which is like
[00:31:29.310] the craziest cap. But that was the only way for them to not like look down on me. Right. So I feel
[00:31:35.650] like that's probably happening on a, on a bigger scale. You have to be like an intelligent Asian
[00:31:40.170] American creator who's capable of like think pieces and stuff like that and having a stance on every
[00:31:44.530] issue or, or you're like not our representation. Yeah. Like why can't I just be an Asian himbo?
[00:31:52.510] Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Turn up. Yeah. Maybe that's what the Riz content in a lot of the Asian American
[00:32:00.430] community is about, right? They're like, why can't I just be like a hot, cool guy? Like,
[00:32:07.770] yeah. Oh my God. That's a great point actually. I mean, at the end of the day, I will say I am
[00:32:13.390] happy to see the rise of Asian creators and whatnot. I feel like are very mainstream, but I do feel a
[00:32:19.070] little bit weird about it sometimes because like the Riz content in some ways, a lot of these
[00:32:23.350] creators are kind of like hopping on whatever is trendy or like on the bandwagon. But is it weird that
[00:32:29.290] what's trendy is Asian faces? You know, I'm like, I'm glad you're capitalizing on it, but then that
[00:32:35.030] also makes me uncomfortable, like what you're capitalizing on. And this is no shade to like
[00:32:39.990] the creators themselves, but it's like the wave and like the movement and the general audience
[00:32:44.870] thinking of us as a trend is like mildly weird. You're so right. For every Asian creator, if you
[00:32:51.990] looked at their comments, they would be like, oh my God, you look like Jungkook or like, oh my God,
[00:32:56.790] you look like Won Young. And it's like, please at least name an actual like Asian idol or whatever
[00:33:05.850] that they look like. You're like, this is completely inaccurate. Yeah. Yeah. And the K-pop stuff opens
[00:33:15.990] like a whole new door to there are times where, I mean, Korean content and actually just Asian content
[00:33:22.110] in general is like trendy now and has been for a long time. But I feel like there are always those
[00:33:26.950] moments where someone was, someone is like, oh, you're Korean. Like this new K-drama is popular
[00:33:31.470] right now. Did you watch it? And I'm just like, no. Oh my God. That's right. I was joking with Jisoo
[00:33:38.010] when we were talking about this episode. I was like, oh, that's right. Like there was definitely a period
[00:33:43.210] of time where K-pop started to really blow up and suddenly you are all expected to be like professional
[00:33:49.530] Korean ambassadors. So real. Don't get me wrong. I love my K-pop. In terms of like K-pop,
[00:33:58.750] I also feel like the beauty standards are really insane. It's like a weird combination because I'll
[00:34:04.950] say that I'm Korean and then it's like people will like give me like plus two attractive points.
[00:34:11.330] And I'm like, oh, like you're fetishizing me. But like, I mean, I guess I'll take the points.
[00:34:18.150] I don't know. Like, am I supposed to reject the points? I don't know what to do here.
[00:34:21.270] Yeah. And I do think the beauty standard stuff also stresses me out a lot because
[00:34:27.690] shit, I'm not an idol. What the heck? Yeah. I can't perform to that standard. And I,
[00:34:33.590] I do feel like there's a lot of pressure to sort of like represent Korean-ness in that way. Like
[00:34:39.790] whether it's like, oh, you should be able to like dance and know how to do this makeup trend or
[00:34:44.370] whatever. And you should be good at video games or something. And it's like, damn,
[00:34:48.130] is this how Filipino people feel? Oh my God. Their parents expect them to be good at karaoke.
[00:34:52.730] I heard that if you're Filipino and you're not good at singing, you literally get bullied as like a
[00:34:57.290] kid. Like all my friends said like, oh, I didn't know how to sing, but like they would bully me. So
[00:35:02.110] I had to learn. Yeah. But yeah, it's cool to see Korean stuff trending. I mean, for me,
[00:35:09.910] I feel like I grew up in a Korean household. I grew up watching a lot of like Korean TV, had Korean
[00:35:13.990] friends. So I feel not too stressed about it, but I worry about like, you know, people who don't feel
[00:35:20.370] as connected or maybe they're like Asian or if you guys have read like crying in H Mart, let me just
[00:35:25.750] say, I did not read crying in H Mart. I read the first five pages and I was like, oh my God, this is
[00:35:30.310] an extremely poignant story about like a Asian experience. And like, she feels disconnected because she lost
[00:35:37.630] her mom. I cannot relate to this. I cannot relate to this whatsoever. But the struggle is like
[00:35:43.610] completely real. Right. Yeah. I feel like that is a side effect, though, of these micro categories
[00:35:49.730] blowing up. And some of the micro categories we've been talking about, whether it's like the rave one
[00:35:53.590] or the gaming one, like those are kind of chosen categories. But I feel like there are also micro
[00:35:58.170] categories that are like inflicted onto people. I saw this TikTok once that was like, sorry, I'm not
[00:36:03.710] this kind of Asian and the kind of Asian that they were apologizing for not being was like the
[00:36:08.270] hot Asians on TikTok that like do a specific makeup style or something like that. And that is like what
[00:36:14.990] happens, I think, when like a specific look blows up. Not everyone can relate to that, even if you're
[00:36:20.910] the same racial group or the same ethnic group. So then you start to feel like, oh, these people can
[00:36:25.730] look like this. How come I can't? And I think that's also like the chasm between what we're seeing with
[00:36:30.370] like Asian guys or Asian girls blowing up on TikTok. But then you also see still a lot of Asian people
[00:36:37.230] complaining that in the dating scene, they're seen as like undesirable. I guess mostly like Asian men, I
[00:36:43.590] think is more common for that topic. So it's like weird. It's like we're trending. But then at the same
[00:36:49.730] time, like statistically, we're still kind of suffering in a certain sense.
[00:36:56.790] Dude, just move to the Bay. People date Asians here all the time.
[00:37:01.270] Dude, literally, I give dating advice on my Twitch and that ends up being half of the advice. Like
[00:37:06.370] just move to California, which is not productive advice. Yeah, the housing prices are crazy. But
[00:37:13.050] yeah, touching on like Asian beauty standards. I think it's so crazy that Asian faces are so
[00:37:18.770] trending right now that like Asian fishing is a huge issue. Basically, if you do your makeup in
[00:37:25.630] a certain way, like Douyin or like K-Beauty or like Japanese makeup, like if you have a little bit of
[00:37:30.530] like aeggiosar, people will be like, oh my god, you're Asian fishing. Like you're trying to be
[00:37:34.770] Asian, aren't you? And it's just such a double edged sword because I'm sure some people are maybe like
[00:37:41.150] appropriating. But I feel like most of the time what I've seen is like, for example, I have this like
[00:37:46.750] Native American friend and she looks very traditionally like maybe Asian, like she has
[00:37:50.470] monolids and stuff like that. And she gets so much hate and she's literally like, this is my face,
[00:37:55.550] guys. Like I don't know what to say. Yeah, it's definitely really hard to figure out that line
[00:38:02.170] between like appreciation for like the trend and the beauty and how much of it is like, oh, like,
[00:38:07.650] do you want to be Asian? Like you're scaring me a little bit there, Ariana Grande.
[00:38:13.630] Yeah. I mean, that makes total sense because your friend has monolids and a huge part of Asian makeup
[00:38:19.710] is, you know, adapting around monolids because so much of like the makeup that we see in the
[00:38:25.450] Western world does not really work with monolids. So it's like, of course, your friend should like
[00:38:30.850] look into what the other monolidded people are doing and adapt, you know, use that to work for
[00:38:37.130] herself too. So it's definitely applicable to people. But yeah, I guess you're right. Like some
[00:38:41.090] people maybe hop on to these trends in a more like appropriation-esque way that's almost like
[00:38:48.350] taking advantage of it. I think it's mostly like the historical context of it, which is always really
[00:38:55.750] hard to separate from like the current thing that's happening. So I think that's sort of the context.
[00:39:00.710] But it's also like all of us are pretty young. And like if we didn't do that in the past, like is it
[00:39:08.530] okay to do Asian beauty trends? I don't know the rules here. I don't make society's rules, you know,
[00:39:13.770] I just live in here. But I've even seen it to the extent that there's like RCTA communities, which
[00:39:19.610] stands for like race change to another. I'm sorry if I'm exposing your audience to like really horrible
[00:39:24.690] content. But this stuff is really popular with very like young people, right? Because when a lot of people
[00:39:31.470] who are Asian, when they were younger, you know, they thought to themselves like, oh, I wish I was white.
[00:39:36.430] Right. And it's because they were like bullied or they wanted to fit in. But now there's other
[00:39:41.950] ethnicities who are like, I wish I was Asian. And I think, oh, my God. No, like you can completely
[00:39:49.750] appreciate Asian culture. And you know what? I will be your ambassador. Like hit me up. I will show you
[00:39:55.010] Asian things without you having to feel like, oh, let me change my race. Right. Yeah. Also, that's not a
[00:40:01.050] thing. I don't know. I have also seen that pocket of TikTok too. And I feel like I feel so conflicted
[00:40:07.870] about it because in a certain sense, I feel like Gen Alpha is growing up in an era that's like less
[00:40:15.610] racist in terms of like what's portrayed on mainstream media. Because to be honest, like I
[00:40:20.710] feel like a lot of the movies and like content that was like shown on cable or like literally in
[00:40:25.490] movie theaters when we were young was actually blatantly racist. And Gen Alpha is not exposed
[00:40:31.510] to that content as much anymore. But also at the same time, I've been seeing such racist shit on like
[00:40:37.430] IG reels. I feel like it's really bad or certain pockets of TikTok where I read the comments and
[00:40:43.350] I'm like, I thought we were past this, but it's actually coming back with like a vengeance. So then
[00:40:48.310] it makes me feel like Gen Alpha isn't necessarily born in like a post-racism era. You know,
[00:40:53.250] they're just born in an era where it's like virtue signaling and like, you know,
[00:40:58.630] portraying yourself as anti-racist coexists with like other very harshly racist content on social
[00:41:06.090] media. So it's almost like the two extremes have just gotten more extreme and it's all like on one
[00:41:11.530] platform still. So I don't know, maybe this changing race thing is like a product of both of those things
[00:41:19.890] coexisting because wanting to change your race into being Asian is kind of wholesome and anti-racist,
[00:41:27.210] but also like severely racist and like, you know, appropriative at the same time.
[00:41:32.190] Yeah, that's accurate.
[00:41:34.130] I think like a more mainstream example of that too could be like the Sumu Liu and like
[00:41:39.570] Boba thing, Boba. Like they smoke Boba with like the second B. There was like a Shark Tank episode
[00:41:44.430] where somebody pitched Boba and they were like, oh, the drink doesn't have to be ethnical anymore.
[00:41:48.430] Even though they literally work with Taiwanese manufacturers, but they're trying to pitch Boba
[00:41:52.490] as like this non quote unquote ethnic drink to be sold to like a different market. And you could
[00:41:59.270] tell those people were also like, I don't think they were necessarily American. Like they had a
[00:42:04.090] slight accent. So I think they're from a different country. Right. And then that means like whole other
[00:42:07.670] race relations or whatever. But Simu Liu was like, hey, like this is a like a Taiwanese
[00:42:13.270] Taiwanese drink. Like this already exists. The other panel member who was like a South Asian woman,
[00:42:18.970] she was the one who was actually like, hey, like there's room for innovation. Like that. Right.
[00:42:24.910] Yeah. I think that's sort of like a, an example of those two micro microcosms, like you said,
[00:42:30.350] or those two like voices talking to each other. Right. Like one is sort of appreciating in a
[00:42:35.050] misunderstanding way of this thing. And then like the quote unquote woke person who actually knows
[00:42:40.090] like the situation is like, hey, like that's, that's not exactly right. Yeah. And then there's
[00:42:45.530] a third person who was like, why are you angry? Like stop being angry. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah.
[00:42:50.890] It is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. I think part of me kind of wonders how long this trend, this Asian
[00:42:57.750] trend is going to continue because the reality of it is like to us, it's obviously not a trend. It's
[00:43:02.670] just like our life, but in the mass media and like in the general audience, I think it kind of
[00:43:09.610] might be a trend. So then are we riding this wave and then suddenly it's going to crash and then
[00:43:14.850] everyone's going to go back to like looking down or making racist jokes about Asian communities again,
[00:43:19.930] or is it going to truly continue and become also mainstream? And then the other aspect of me is
[00:43:26.590] also like we tend to tunnel vision on like specific ethnicities and like the representation of those
[00:43:32.690] specific ethnicities. Everyone else who doesn't fit into those molds just don't get as much of a
[00:43:39.610] voice. So I feel like that is also a pretty big problem as well. And you can see that fallout in
[00:43:45.570] like subtle Asian traits, like how it initially started. I was like, guys, look, we're all Asian.
[00:43:49.970] And then people started coming out and being like, well, yes, we are all Asian, but why are we only
[00:43:54.550] talking about, you know, these three things? We don't feel like we're being represented. And then
[00:43:59.590] those communities start to like make their own sub pages and whatnot. And, you know, I just hope that
[00:44:05.290] other communities instead of just East Asian countries are going to get a voice. And hopefully
[00:44:11.650] it's moving towards there. But, you know, it's it's just hard, I think.
[00:44:16.090] Oh, I love that, actually, because sometimes people will bring up like Korean stuff and I'm like, yo,
[00:44:21.410] yeah, the Korean stuff is everywhere. We don't need to talk about Korean stuff. I'm like, what Asian are
[00:44:24.510] you like? You teach me phrases in your language. Like, what do you guys eat? Like what it was your culture?
[00:44:29.810] Same with like South Asian inclusion. I remember that was like a huge issue in the subtle Asian
[00:44:34.250] traits page, which is crazy because like we are all so Asian. We have all the same like cultural
[00:44:41.190] roots and it's almost like sort of a disconnect from our history. Like if you go to South Asia,
[00:44:47.470] like you'll see people who look East Asian, right? Or like whatever, because these lines are all
[00:44:53.010] arbitrarily drawn. If you guys watch Monkey Man, which is like a fantastic movie by Dev Patel, by the way,
[00:44:58.810] like I highly, highly recommend it. You can see he represents all different types of South Asians.
[00:45:03.530] And it just made me feel really connected like to South Asia. Like that's why I think like media
[00:45:09.390] representation is really good. And I think it's really important to reconnect with generations past
[00:45:16.210] in order to like fully understand what it means to be like Asian, sort of like a homecoming situation.
[00:45:22.250] Yeah, I feel like there's like a level of erasure that comes with being Asian in the US.
[00:45:27.950] I think maybe some of that is just like the history that we learn is American focus. And then
[00:45:34.070] also after that, it's more like Eurocentric than it is revolving around Asia. But when I talk to my
[00:45:40.070] parents, like they know so much about the intricacies of different countries that exist in East Asia and
[00:45:45.390] Southeast Asia and South Asia. And these are things that I don't know, even though I feel like on a day
[00:45:50.850] basis, like I interact with a lot of people who come from these communities, we just don't talk
[00:45:56.750] about it as much or like learn about it as much in the US. I don't know, it's kind of like what happens
[00:46:01.790] when you're in like a melting pot, maybe like you just start to not hear these things as much as you
[00:46:07.730] would if you grew up elsewhere. And it's crazy, because my parents grew up in Korea. And it's like,
[00:46:13.690] they're learning about shit that I'm not learning about in the US. But Korea is like a very homogenous
[00:46:18.710] country. So I just don't understand why that divide happens.
[00:46:22.630] I think the way your ethnicity is treated in the US depends on the greater like geopolitical
[00:46:31.470] relationship between the US and your country, right? Realistically. And yeah, the US is infamous,
[00:46:37.070] like you said, for not having good international studies and teachings, right? Because like,
[00:46:43.350] ultimately, our schools have to teach us like US is the best and like,
[00:46:48.370] yeah, we have to do all this military intervention stuff. Okay, whatever, controversial, whatever,
[00:46:52.670] too much. Sorry. But yeah, I do think it's ironic that when you go to other countries,
[00:47:00.550] they have stronger stereotypes being in homogenous nations, but they're actually more well educated.
[00:47:07.030] And then in the US, you're supposed to have all these understandings of race relations. And if you say
[00:47:14.050] something wrong, or like not updated, people will like rebuke you, or they'll be like,
[00:47:18.890] oh, you're stereotyping or whatever. But in reality, that's just an American understanding of things,
[00:47:24.570] which is one standpoint.
[00:47:26.670] Yeah, it's so true. Like we try to be so woke, but we have like no education on the rest of the world.
[00:47:32.090] Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:34.410] And I think the intentions are good. But it's like the reality is we just like don't know shit.
[00:47:38.150] Yeah, we really don't. I always try to like pick my parents brains about like their childhood. And I'm
[00:47:44.270] like, dude, there's just so like similar to what you're saying, Jisoo, like there's just so much
[00:47:48.570] I don't know that they just know. I'm like, how do you know all this Chinese history? And they're
[00:47:53.910] like, dude, we're like, we fucking grew up there. What are you talking about? You know,
[00:47:59.450] dude, there's so much Chinese history, Lord, though. It's like thousands of years,
[00:48:02.770] so many arcs, bro.
[00:48:06.870] Well, I feel like this, this topic is super complex. And it's kind of never ending, too,
[00:48:12.550] because it's always evolving. But I thought it was pretty fun to like sit down and talk about
[00:48:17.230] some of our complex feelings. And I think ultimately, there's so many perspectives and so
[00:48:25.530] many facets to this topic that I don't even think it's like black and white where it's like,
[00:48:32.390] oh, you know, this is wrong. This is right. It's just like, oh, these are things that are happening.
[00:48:36.290] And how do you feel about it? And like, you know, what is a direction that you personally
[00:48:41.770] want to go into? So thank you, Jisoo and Yane for sitting down with me and chatting about our
