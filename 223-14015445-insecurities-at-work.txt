[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. Before we get into our topic today, I have a story to share. I guess it's kind of relevant to one of our previous episodes where we talked about how old we feel we are.
[00:00:27.090] As I've mentioned before, I am living at home with my parents right now. And the bed that I've been sleeping in is the bed that I've had since like, I don't know, junior high maybe?
[00:00:39.970] It's an old bed basically. I decided to make some changes, partially because I wanted to move my bed so that I can see my TV straight on in my room. Priorities. Yeah. And then also partially
[00:00:56.930] because there's this meme that I saw before that basically says you're not a true adult until your bed is in the middle of your room. Oh my god. So I got a new bed, and I dismantled my old bed
[00:01:12.130] and I put the new bed in the middle of my room so that I can see my TV clearly. I guess that is a very adult thing. I never thought about it that way. But I just remember a couple days ago,
[00:01:22.370] we hopped on a video call to talk about some podcast stuff. And I saw that you had your new bed, your bedroom looked a little different. And the first thing I asked you was, where did you put
[00:01:31.810] your stuffed animals? Because Crystal used to have so many like stuffed animals on her bed. And I was just like, where did they all go? But you immediately found a new home for them.
[00:01:41.730] For most of them. But there's still like a bunch that I'm not too sure what to do with them yet. I'll have to like sort through it. Because I feel like there's some that are like constant
[00:01:52.850] rotation on the bed, you know? But some of them are like kind of old now. And I'm like, is it time to move on? Oh, but it's so sad. I feel like every stuffed animal has such a specific
[00:02:04.210] memory associated with them. Like I threw out a bunch when my parents moved to Korea. To this day, I'm still like, maybe I should have kept some of it. Oh, I'm still deciding. So we'll see.
[00:02:14.610] TBD. Indeed. I don't really have a story this week. But I guess just like a mini life update. A couple weeks ago, two weeks ago, almost exactly actually, we went to Miami on my Bachelorette
[00:02:28.930] trip. It was actually like a joint Bachelor Bachelorette trip. And it was a ton of people, a ton of fun, super crazy weekend. But basically, since we got back, my voice has been not the same.
[00:02:42.130] And it's crazy because the first week that we were back, my voice was gone. So even more shot than it is right now. But like bodily I felt okay. It was more just like, I sounded so hoarse,
[00:02:53.170] basically. And then, you know, when the weekend came, I was like, Oh, thank God, like I didn't get sick or anything. And it was just like my voice, hopefully my voice heals in time for the
[00:03:02.130] wedding, which is now in about three weeks or so. Oh, God. And then literally the day after me thinking this, I got sick. So I kind of have a cough and the cough is really the only symptom
[00:03:14.930] like everything else is normal. So I guess I kind of jinxed myself there a little bit by being too optimistic. Hopefully, it works out. Hopefully, it's better to get sick now than closer to the
[00:03:26.850] wedding. That's true. I'm getting it out of the way. Basically, you have three weeks to heal. I'm sure it's doable. All right, well, let's get to the topic at hand for this week. Work insecurities. I feel like we've talked in the past briefly about imposter syndrome,
[00:03:47.010] which we'll probably talk more about today again. But there are also other insecurities at work that you know, aren't necessarily specifically related to performance. Now that we've been working for a while, we thought it would be interesting to chat a little bit about our work
[00:04:05.490] insecurities. And I think this episode and this topic specifically will probably be a little bit more on the vulnerable side. I always find it a little bit difficult to really share
[00:04:16.930] about the challenges that I face at work because one like this like a public platform so anyone can kind of listen in. But also it's just one of those things where to an extent work is kind
[00:04:27.890] of a reflection of your skills or like that's how my mindset is sometimes and it doesn't necessarily reflect my character. But to an extent, I think it does represent some aspect of myself. So you
[00:04:39.570] know, it's, of course difficult to talk about the things that make us insecure about this. So hopefully you guys can sort of relate to our experiences and whatnot. As we talk through our
[00:04:49.330] insecurities about work. Totally agree. I feel like also because work is such a big part of our lives. A lot of things happen at work. And I think it's just a very possible for a lot of insecurities to
[00:05:04.610] therefore come up as well, whether you realize it sometimes or not. But sometimes I feel like it can be a bit subconscious as well. I guess to start us off though, do you have any general work insecurities
[00:05:19.170] that you can think of off the top of your head? So I do and I guess this is probably a fairly broad one that might encompass a lot of, you know, smaller work insecurities. But I think one of the
[00:05:30.290] thoughts that I tend to have is, oh, I'm not doing something enough or I'm not good enough or I'm not fast enough or, you know, all these things that kind of come back to my lack of skill set or maybe
[00:05:43.490] something missing in my work ethic or my character that makes me a bad worker. And it kind of makes me think actually, because if there's something that I've kind of seen and learned in the last
[00:05:56.930] five years or so of working, it's that there's no one archetype of a good worker. So I kind of feel like back in school, there was like that archetype of a good student. Maybe it could be divided into
[00:06:10.690] like the naturally smart person and like the super hard worker, but that was kind of the extent, right? It's just like two types of people. But I think in the workplace, there's so many different
[00:06:20.210] skill sets that make someone a beneficial partner or a beneficial employee in the workplace, depending on like what job you are, or maybe even if you're like a manager or like an individual contributor. So there's no true this is like the perfect worker definition, I guess. But
[00:06:38.210] maybe I'm just used to like that school rubric grading system where I'm like, okay, maybe I'm on the worker scale, like a B or whatever, like some sort of like average grade. And I'm like,
[00:06:47.970] why am I not like an excelling worker? Interesting. So you like kind of internally grade yourself? I think so. And if there's certain things that don't meet what I think is a quality of like
[00:07:02.450] the ideal worker, then I like judge myself very harshly. Oh my god. And I asked like what the ideal worker is. I think it's someone who's always on kind of like work is life. To me,
[00:07:16.530] that is like a plus worker, someone who puts work above like other aspects of life. I guess just in my daily life, it's very hard for me to think that way. Like yes, I find aspects of
[00:07:26.610] work important. And I do understand certain things are priorities and stuff. But at the end of the day, like work is work to me. I know to some people, the performance of the company is directly
[00:07:37.410] tied to like how they see the performance of their life or like, you know, like different positions kind of hinge more on like the company's performance and stuff like that. Yeah, I guess just it's hard
[00:07:46.610] for me to think that way. So then when I see people who are super committed, responding to emails at 11pm taking late night meetings, early morning calls even more than I feel like I do, that I'm
[00:07:57.730] like, oh, this person is legit. They are like the worker, the teammate that someone wants to have. I see. Whoa. In a way, I can relate to that a bit where when I see someone working late,
[00:08:11.970] just off hours, I guess, the thought definitely creeps up like, oh, should I be doing this too? If they're doing it, but I also be doing this. And hopefully that makes me look good. You know,
[00:08:24.530] like a really hard worker, as you mentioned, the ideal worker or whatever. But realistically, when I think about that, I'm like, I don't know if I have the willpower to work those extra hours
[00:08:37.810] when it's not needed, necessarily. But I do think it's like inevitable because it kind of makes you compare yourself. Initially, I was gonna say especially if it's someone who is higher up than
[00:08:49.650] you. But now that I think about it, it could go both ways. Because if it's someone on your level two, then you're like, oh, shoot, that's like a direct comparison. Someone on my level is going
[00:09:00.690] above and beyond, should I be trying to replicate that? And then if it's like a manager or just someone higher than you, then it's kind of like, oh, shoot, like that person's going above and
[00:09:11.890] beyond. That's probably how they got to their level by like doing all this. That makes sense. It's kind of like if they're already a higher level than you, then they become like the role model. But if they're your peer, then maybe they're like your competition a little bit.
[00:09:27.650] And I feel like that is, of course, like a very common insecurity, like competition. And then comparing yourself with your co-workers or even just with what you think you should be doing. I think I experienced that kind of insecurity a lot more in the past when I had
[00:09:48.450] co-workers who did similar things as me. So I think I had a really bad case of imposter syndrome back then because my co-workers basically did the same thing as me. We just worked on separate projects
[00:10:02.850] and I would always look at their project and be like, oh, shoot, this is like infinitely better than mine. But like looking back, I don't think it was ever an issue. It was never like a complaint,
[00:10:14.770] like, oh, you need to step up your game and do what this person is doing. Nothing of that sort ever came up. If anything, like maybe to the untrained eye, our work looks similar. But to me,
[00:10:31.010] because I'm kind of in the design industry and I've seen a lot of stuff, I'm just like, oh, shoot, these things this guy did better. This project overall is like better in whatever way. But yeah, ultimately all that worry led to nothing.
[00:10:45.410] Dude, it's interesting that you say that because I can definitely relate to that internal freak out and maybe not so much like a freak out, but it's just like a constant
[00:10:54.770] recurring thought that is sort of hard to suppress. But sometimes when I look back at times where I was comparing myself to someone or I guess like being more conscious than I need to about someone
[00:11:06.690] in particular, I realized it's like all in my head. No one had ever made me feel like, oh, we should be competition for each other or no one was ever truly comparing us. But the mental block was just so hard to remove.
[00:11:20.130] Dude, yeah. I think that was when I truly understood imposter syndrome because I would actually think, oh, they're going to figure out soon. Like when is it coming? The moment when they realize I'm a fraud. Shit.
[00:11:35.650] Where I'd be like, oh my God, like that moment is coming soon. They're going to realize they hired, they made a mistake in their hiring basically. But you know, that moment never came. And actually
[00:11:47.090] on the contrary, my manager put in a good recommendation for me and then that's how I got my current job. So if anything, only good things happened even though I was like so stuck in that imposter syndrome phase, I guess.
[00:12:01.890] That's interesting to me because to an extent, I wonder how much of this is like our age. We've talked about how we sometimes feel a little bit self-conscious about being on the younger
[00:12:11.490] side at work. And, you know, when you're younger and more used to school than you are to work, for example, it's kind of like you're pretending to be an employee of a company because you don't
[00:12:22.130] fully know how the system works yet. But I can also kind of see that maybe every single time you move companies or maybe if you do like a horizontal shift from like one team to another, I can totally see someone having imposter syndrome even if they're older.
[00:12:38.370] So it's interesting. Like, I wonder at what level of experience you're kind of like, okay, I am fully entitled to this job and to this role and you're not like doubting yourself constantly. Oh God, never. I will say though that as I mentioned, like good things happened
[00:12:57.250] despite my imposter syndrome. I didn't really attribute it to my work. I think like actually the first thought that came to mind was like, oh maybe my manager or like team members liked my personality. And I was like, maybe that's how like these good things happened or whatever,
[00:13:21.250] which is kind of funny because that's what I'm insecure about right now in my current job. I'm like super insecure about, oh am I like not interesting to my co-workers? Do they like me?
[00:13:35.490] These kinds of things. And I think part of it is because I joined this team during COVID, so we had less in-person interactions until more recently. And then also an interesting change was
[00:13:48.210] I have more introverts on my team now, but before I had more extroverts. And so I think now that the introvert energy is stronger, it just kind of feels like it takes slightly longer and extra
[00:14:02.690] push for the team to like get to know each other. Yeah, for a while I really grappled with that as an insecurity as well. Dude, yeah. The social aspect of work is actually such a big stress. Sometimes I almost feel like
[00:14:15.810] it's a bigger stress than the work itself because to an extent like work can be evaluated in an objective way, but getting along with your co-workers or befriending them, sometimes it's sheer luck. Oh, the timing didn't work out. Or by the time I joined, these people were already
[00:14:31.410] paired up or friends or whatnot. So I totally know what you mean. I think one of the things that I feel when I'm at work is I think in terms of some of my social insecurities,
[00:14:43.570] sometimes I just have this very irrational fear that everyone hates me. And this isn't actually just work related. This is just like, I think my general anxieties about the world existing in society. When someone doesn't smile or someone doesn't say hi internally, I'm sometimes like,
[00:15:01.010] okay, yeah, they hate me. And I think just being in a smaller company, the social web of it all is a little bit more intricate than maybe at a bigger company where it's easier to be anonymous.
[00:15:12.610] So yeah, I just have that recurring fear of if I didn't befriend everyone and have a personal relationship with everyone, then I'm uncool. Or maybe they don't think I'm worth knowing or
[00:15:22.530] something like that, which is so negative for no reason. But it's just the first thing that pops up into my head. Yeah, I guess that's tough too, because it's like impossible to know every single
[00:15:33.410] person in the office. I guess maybe if you're like in a very small company, less than 20 people, but like, I feel like even then, it's hard to know everyone and be like, friendly or personal with
[00:15:46.530] every single person in the company slash office. So it's like, realistically, you should give yourself a break. But also at the same time, it definitely feels like you need to be on everyone's best side. So it almost matters even more to be like really likable in the office.
[00:16:04.930] Yeah, definitely. And I think it only seems like something that I'm failing to do because I can see that other people are succeeding in it. And I think that probably goes for a lot of things at
[00:16:15.650] work, even just beyond the social stuff. But some people are just very talented and remembering everyone's names or going up and introducing themselves. Maybe they've been a part of the company for a longer time, or they're in a more high visibility, like leadership position.
[00:16:30.770] So naturally, as like a 27 year old, I guess, slightly lower level employee, I shouldn't be comparing myself to these cornerstones of the company. But I do. I guess the point I'm trying
[00:16:42.290] to make is like, on my happy days, it's fine and dandy. Like I can just look at that situation and be like, oh, that's so admirable that this person is able to pull that off. But it's on the bad days,
[00:16:51.890] right? Or the off days where you're already feeling insecure about yourself. That's where the spin starts of like, oh, it's because I'm x or it's because I'm y that I'm unable to do that.
[00:17:02.850] Yeah, I think interacting in the office, especially is just difficult because as you mentioned earlier, you kind of have to be on the whole time. We're kind of not used to that anymore. True. Honestly, there are definitely days where I go in the office and I'm just like,
[00:17:20.530] wow, I hope no one's in the office. I'm just gonna try to like go in and get some work done and then quietly leave. Please no one look at me. You know? Yes, I totally feel you. I mean,
[00:17:32.050] some people are just so good at playing the social political game in the office. And I think that's what's very striking to me too. And I guess not everyone thinks about it as like politics per
[00:17:44.050] se, but it's more of just like connecting with people and if they're higher level, then that's great. But for me, I feel like it's a little bit harder to do that. You know, when people are really
[00:17:55.010] good at the social game and they are on and they are ready to show up, I can't help but think sometimes, oh, is this going to affect my performance review? Or like, will this person
[00:18:04.690] have better career growth than me because they're closer to whoever and things like that. It's a lot of weirdness that I think reminds me sort of of seeing like a teacher's pet back in high school
[00:18:16.290] or like middle school. But in the workplace, it's a little bit more subtle, I guess. Right, right. That's true. I think this is something that I've also come to realize more and more,
[00:18:27.730] the longer that we work, is that like, sure you can go to work and, you know, keep your head down and just like do the work and do well, move along in your career projection or whatever trajectory.
[00:18:41.890] But ultimately, having a relationship with the people you work with, like you don't have to be best friends or anything, but like having a positive and good relationship with them is super beneficial. Because a lot of work is like interacting with people and if you have some
[00:18:57.890] sort of like solid foundation, then it's harder for people to be mean to you. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, like the simplest way I can put it is like if they kind of know you,
[00:19:10.050] they're going to try to be nice to you and, you know, give you the benefit of the doubt maybe if you, you know, slip up sometimes here and there. So it's ultimately a benefit and that's also where
[00:19:22.450] as you mentioned, like an insecurity lies because you're like, oh shoot, like how can I be better in this? Am I doing this right? There's no real playbook or like guide on how to socialize properly at work and like form these bonds. So it's definitely always encouraging,
[00:19:39.010] but also discouraging seeing other people do it so well and then you're like, oh shoot, okay, how do I be like them? Yeah, exactly. And I think also the connections that you make at work
[00:19:51.890] can live beyond your life at that specific company as well. I guess it depends on what industry you are and what kind of field you work in, but at least in the field that I'm in, I feel like it's
[00:20:04.370] a pretty small pool of workers. So it's very, very common for people to have been like ex-co-workers from this place and, you know, in the past life they knew each other and things like that. So
[00:20:15.330] I think the pressure of like knowing that sometimes of okay, these connections that I make now might be helpful for me 20, 30 years down the line or, you know, there's like some sort of benefit to like growing this relationship. I don't know why, but when my brain thinks,
[00:20:31.170] okay, this is really beneficial and helpful, then it starts to get anxiety about it. So then I'm like, okay, there's a really big benefit to this, which means that if I don't build this or grow
[00:20:42.850] this, then I'm losing out on that benefit. So then the pressure of like knowing that if I fuck this up, then I'm walking away from like a big plus in my life just makes the task even more daunting
[00:20:54.210] and scary. But it's like, there's no need to think about it this way because really it's just like, oh, you know, I want to get to know this person anyway. It's an added benefit that this might be
[00:21:02.530] beneficial later. But is this like in general anyone or is it more for like people who are maybe like a higher up somewhere where you're like, oh, this is like a big potential career
[00:21:19.730] connection? I guess I feel the pressure a little bit more for a higher ups or like management level. But I do sometimes think about how, you know, at work you naturally gravitate towards certain people, just personality meshes or maybe you guys have a lot of overlapping projects
[00:21:35.890] together and those are very natural and organic friendships. For me, I think I just feel content with those friendships and I don't really feel a need to like branch out because there's like an
[00:21:47.250] extra benefit or something like that. But because I don't do that, I feel like I'm losing out on other relationships that could be helpful later on. I see what you mean. I think I'm kind of similar
[00:21:57.650] to. I'm not really one to like just reach out, but it's more like, oh, well if you're going to be on this project too, okay, then we can meet. Right. Especially in terms of like higher ups
[00:22:10.210] and stuff. But I do sometimes feel, I don't know what the right word here is, like maybe almost like jealous? Where I'm like, damn, like this person knows everyone at work. I don't know people like
[00:22:24.530] this certain person knows everyone, but then I'm like, okay, this is like clearly my own fault though. Like I'm not that, I'm not a social butterfly at work, so there's only so much you can do with
[00:22:35.170] that. But I think it does ultimately lead to like some sort of, I don't know if it's necessarily like insecurity, but it's almost like a feeling of, oh shoot, I could slash should be better in this area.
[00:22:49.810] And I feel like maybe as we talk about all this stuff, the working environment seems to lend itself well to like these certain feelings. Just constantly comparing yourself to people around you. There's like a constant comparison, like maybe in the background of my mind, just like constantly
[00:23:09.490] running, comparing me to everyone around me. I think it's because it's work and there's like the idea of up and down movement. You could move up, but you could also just as easily like move down.
[00:23:22.450] So maybe we're just like always hyper aware of our surroundings at work because we're like, oh shoot, how do I be better? And with that, it's just very natural to compare yourself to people who you think
[00:23:35.730] are like better. I guess it's just like, it's a breeding ground for insecurities. Yeah, that's a good point. I guess it does kind of make me feel like I'm back in high school again,
[00:23:46.370] like comparing myself to the popular kids or the smart kids wondering, oh, how come I'm not like them or trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong basically. But in the flip side, I feel like
[00:23:59.170] sometimes the insecurities that I feel from these comparisons that I make with my coworkers at work go beyond just like my skill level. But sometimes it makes me question my career choices, I guess
[00:24:10.530] is the right phrase. Yeah. It's nothing super dramatic or anything, but it is kind of dramatic in that when I have coworkers who are maybe super passionate about what they do or when you watch
[00:24:23.250] them speak, it seems like, oh, they really love this role or like they really love this company or this job, things like that. It makes me wonder if I really love this role or if I really love
[00:24:35.010] this company. And this isn't to say that I'm like constantly questioning this, but I think the nature of these comparisons is that it plants these ideas inside your head that maybe weren't even
[00:24:45.090] there in the first place. So at least for me, when I've seen coworkers really excel in their work or be super passionate about what they're doing, I just have questions of like, I wonder if I'm
[00:24:57.810] as passionate about what I'm doing or how do other people see me is like the other question too. Do I come off that passionate or do I come off like I don't care? That's a good observation.
[00:25:10.610] You're right. Like there's definitely those people at work who you're like, whoa, they were made for this role. They are killing it in the vibes category. But I guess it's kind of similar
[00:25:25.250] to like a conversation we've had before where it's almost like social media, you know? Like we just see the good parts, but we don't know what the behind the scenes necessarily, you know, maybe
[00:25:37.570] they're just really good at being a hype man, bringing the vibes up. But like behind the scenes, they're like, I don't know, stressed as fuck and like working their ass off or something.
[00:25:49.890] But you're right. I think there's so many things that make me as well kind of think, is this still the right job for me? And I think we're probably coming around the age where these existential
[00:26:05.170] crises are more common because we've been working for like at least five years now. I guess these thoughts, at least for me, these thoughts pop up where it's just like, oh, this is gonna be like
[00:26:17.730] the rest of our working lives. Yeah, no, totally. Yeah, and I'm like, is this it? Like, are we happy here? Like, is this good to continue here? I actually had a friend text me recently and she was like,
[00:26:33.250] I think I might want to do a career change. Oh my god. And I was like, damn. And she was like, yeah, I just don't know if I can continue down this job anymore. But like, I also have no idea
[00:26:45.810] what I want to change my career to. And I was like, I don't know either. Like, I don't know if I want to stay on this career path either. And I don't know if I were to change what I would do either.
[00:26:56.610] Dude, yeah, I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately too. And I think it truly is the age. It's like truly the point where you're like, okay, I'm used to it. It's no longer super new and scary
[00:27:05.970] to me. So then like, what's next? Almost. The thought that I've been having a lot lately is like, okay, say I don't change anything. So I'm maintaining whatever is normal right now. Then in
[00:27:17.810] the next, say, like 10 years or something, if I become a director, but just like moving down the path that I'm currently in, like would I be happy? Because if that's what I want, then that's this is
[00:27:29.650] the perfect spot that I'm in. Or like, I just need to continue walking down this path essentially. But if it's not, then it's like, what's the point almost? And I think there's no real answer to it
[00:27:41.410] probably. And I can't ever separate how much of this is just humans naturally just don't want to work. I think people enjoy playing more than they enjoy working. So I'm sure a lot of this
[00:27:53.010] existential crisis is that, but it's also just like, how do you know if this is what you want to do? Because I guess I'm just not the type of person who's like, head over heels. This is like
[00:28:04.370] the dream job that I've had since I was one years old, you know, like that kind of thing. I guess if you're not extra passionate, like this isn't your dream job from day one,
[00:28:14.050] then everyone else who's not in that perspective, shares this perspective of like, this is nice, I guess. But like, is this perfect? Or is this what I truly want? And then maybe this is where we all
[00:28:24.690] spin. Yeah, I mean, work is work. I feel like, yeah, okay, I'm gonna blame this on media and movies. Because what you said earlier totally reminded me of that. You have a dream job since
[00:28:41.490] like a baby, since you were a baby, and then you work towards that and you like, you know, try to get that job. And then in the end, it's like all happy. You're like, oh my god,
[00:28:49.650] like, this is my dream job. Like, this is the best ever. That's like such a fairy tale, like movie kind of synopsis. And it just got me thinking how like, you know how there's that
[00:29:01.970] saying that's like, love the work you do and you don't work a day in your life? Dude, okay, I think that is totally misleading. Because every time something that I enjoy turns into work, it's no longer enjoyable. Right? Because you're like being forced to do it.
[00:29:21.410] Suddenly there's a schedule, there's like deadlines, people are depending on you. It literally like sucks the enjoyment out of it. So I actually do not go by that saying. I am anti that saying.
[00:29:36.450] So what I kind of go by like personally, is if you can find a job that you don't hate, and you can like, find joy in parts of it, then that's like already really good. Because if you think about it, a lot of people probably hate their jobs,
[00:29:55.490] like legitimately hate their jobs, right? We're already super lucky if we can find a job that is not soul sucking, and like, just ripping you apart, especially if you have like cool co workers,
[00:30:09.810] and like a pretty good environment. Then I'm like, dude, honestly, that is like more than I can ask for. I think that's a good way of looking at it. I don't know if it's
[00:30:20.690] it comes to me as naturally like that kind of perspective. Like I definitely understand it because like you said, work is work. I'm not someone who grew up with like a huge passion
[00:30:29.570] for insert whatever field. So then finding the next best thing is like a stable job where I'm happy enough, and I'm doing well enough and things like that. I guess the question is like,
[00:30:41.090] if we're going to be doing this or whatever work thing for the next like 60 years, then is good enough? Good enough? You know, like, basically, if I only have one shot on this earth, what do I want
[00:30:55.330] to be doing for 60 years? Is it this specific job? I guess I can't imagine a job where I would be completely and you know, 100% satisfied. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't keep searching.
[00:31:06.930] I don't know. I think that's fair. I guess I try not to think too hard about it because you know, it's potentially depressing. It really is. But I guess my personal philosophy is kind of
[00:31:19.410] like, try to fulfill your life in the other aspects, like you know, hobbies, outside of work. But honestly, that kind of works for me, but it doesn't necessarily work for everyone. And work,
[00:31:34.530] if we think about it, it does take up a huge chunk of our lives. I think I saw a chart once that was like, the amount of time you see certain people and like co-workers was the highest. Oh my god.
[00:31:47.570] Because like, if you work a standard nine to five job, you literally see them the most, like in your life. And I was like, oh fuck, like should I be making friends at work? Damn dude. I don't know how I feel about that.
[00:32:03.410] It's actually so funny because my hiring manager, who switched teams later on, sometimes I catch up with her and she's like, oh, um, have you been making friends at work? And I was like, oh, uh,
[00:32:16.370] I don't know. Like, um, you know, working on it or in the beginning I was like, oh, not really, but you know, everyone's cool. And she was like, oh, I think it's like nice if you make some
[00:32:28.690] friends at work. That's my tip for you. I was like, shit, she's probably right. Like I should step up my like social life. Dude, I mean, it's hard. I feel like it takes a lot of effort and
[00:32:42.530] the right timing and all of that, but for sure. Highly recommend a close work friend. Shout out to Chelsea. But yeah, I guess like you're right. There's no need to be super negative about it
[00:32:54.210] unless there's something like truly wrong with your job that's like causing you immense distress. Then of course find an outlet. But I guess the other way of looking at it too is like, because we spend literally a third of our lives at work, might as well enjoy it.
[00:33:08.850] The parts of work that I definitely enjoy and kind of value highly for myself, it's like constantly growing or maybe like learning new things or like learning about different aspects of the world that I wouldn't have known otherwise without this position basically. So yeah,
[00:33:23.090] definitely every job has its perks. For sure. This is just my personal view. So like, if people out there are like, no, I need to quit my job. Just do that. You know,
[00:33:35.170] go find the job that makes you happy. To be fair though, I think like I did have that happen. Like my first job out of college. At first I was like, oh, this is like great, you know,
[00:33:46.210] gonna like take it easy and like, you know, hopefully it'll be chill. But then what I started realizing was like I wasn't learning and I didn't like the environment. I don't think I
[00:33:58.290] hated my job necessarily, but there were aspects that like drove me crazy kind of where I was like, oh, I'm like not learning here. Like I'm stagnant and I see no future maybe or like maybe I think
[00:34:13.810] I saw some like issues within the company structure that I personally didn't like and I didn't think it like would be good for me in the long run. So I quickly realized I need to
[00:34:28.130] leave. I was like, okay, yeah, fuck it. Like if you gotta go, you gotta go. So I'm also not opposed to like leaving your job and finding one that brings you more joy. Yeah, and it definitely gets
[00:34:41.410] really complicated once you factor in like the money aspect and you know, the health benefits and all of that. Like I think even like the search to finding the perfect job just logistically is
[00:34:53.090] difficult already. And we're only in our late twenties, but I can't imagine once you have kids and like a family to support and there's like dependents under your name, like I can't imagine
[00:35:03.650] doing a career change in that time of your life. So I guess if you were to do it, then maybe now when you have a little bit less obligations and a little bit less responsibilities would be a good
[00:35:12.850] time for a career change. But yeah, it's hard, you know, like I think in the ideal world, rent would be free, like food would be free, transportation, all of that free. And I could just go into different
[00:35:22.930] fields and see what truly makes sense for me, but money doesn't grow on trees. So it's kind of like you have to consider the practical aspects of life too. But we've actually done an episode about
[00:35:34.290] career changes a long time ago where one of our friends switched from her accounting role and into like aesthetician role because she found that that was her passion. And I just remember being so struck
[00:35:45.250] by that. Like I still think about that sometimes where a decision like that takes so much courage. It of course takes a lot of planning, I think, and the foresight to be able to like plan out how that
[00:35:57.170] fits into your life, like in terms of the career change and the apprenticeships and things like that. So when people do their career changes, I just admire it so much. And I think it's super cool.
[00:36:07.170] And I always root for success for the people that go into career changes. For sure. I also think that the fear of changing your career can have roots in insecurity as well, which is so normal, I think,
[00:36:22.770] and common. But you know, it's inevitable to feel insecure like, oh, well, I've been doing this job for so long. I know it. I can keep doing it. But I don't know the like new job. I don't know if I
[00:36:35.330] would be able to succeed in that. And I don't know what that would look like. And maybe it's naive of me to say, but I do feel like if you're really passionate about it, you're a hardworking
[00:36:46.290] individual. You already have like a decent chance compared to someone who is like, you know, not passionate about it and like not as knowledgeable about a certain career. So I don't know if
[00:36:58.930] that's helpful or not, but I feel like that is on some level encouraging. Yeah, I think it is. And it kind of reminds me of the saying of like, there's no perfect time to have kids.
[00:37:09.970] So you might as well just have them at like whatever time. And I feel like that's applicable to a lot of things in life, actually. There's no perfect time. There's no way to like perfectly
[00:37:19.010] optimize things like you might be really passionate about some job and you make the career change, but that job market might start failing or, you know, a recession might happen, things like that that are so unpredictable. But I guess it goes back to like what you said about
[00:37:32.450] feeling, I guess, confidence in yourself more than your insecurities will let you. So just, you know, trusting yourself, I think can go a long way. And that's the same for work
[00:37:42.290] too. Just like trust in your skills, trust in your work ethic. It's a little bit easier to say than to do, but it's I think a really big building block for your work life. Agreed.
[00:37:55.330] Before we wrap up, I have like a couple of bullet points on random work insecurities that I have. One is, you know how at work there's like free snacks or I guess not every company does,
[00:38:05.730] but at least at our company, we started to have free snacks. Sometimes there's like really good snacks and sometimes there's like bad snacks, right? And we also have free drinks. So sometimes
[00:38:15.250] when I like snack a lot at work, I'm like, does everyone know that I'm snacking like a f**k ton today? You know, like if I'm on like my second bag of chips and I have a can of Coke on my desk or
[00:38:25.170] something, I'm like, do people think, you know, like are people judging me for snacking this much at work? Okay, honestly, they probably don't give a f**k. That's true.
[00:38:35.170] But I totally feel that. I think like one time I was kind of busy, so I took lunch at my desk, which at my company is not very common because we have ample cafeteria space. And I was like
[00:38:46.450] eating at my desk and I just, you know, found myself eating faster and faster because I was like, oh my god, I hope no one walks by and just like sees me eating at my desk because it's like
[00:38:56.930] low-key weird here that like, you know, normally people just go to the cafeteria. So I started like scurfing down my food. I was like, do I need to finish this as fast as possible so no one sees that I'm just eating at my desk?
[00:39:08.210] Oh my god, dude. Honestly, eating at work in general is so cursed because you know when you and your co-workers kind of like sit around a table at the cafeteria, I feel like even then
[00:39:18.130] there's some like awkwardness of if I eat too fast and put my food away or something, is that like rude because other people are still eating? Or if I'm eating hella slow, like is that rude because
[00:39:28.130] people are done with their lunch? Or even when I'm snacking, am I crunching these chips too loud? Like, you know, my boss or like my co-workers next to me, like do they think I'm eating too loud? There's just like these weird things that pop up.
[00:39:42.210] No, absolutely. I used to be like really shy about opening my like cans of sparkling water or coke or whatever, like in the sitting area. Like the off, you know, the desk. Yeah, I was
[00:39:56.770] like, oh my god, this is like so loud. So I would like open it by the fridge, you know, where it's like no one's working or less people are sitting around and working. I open it there and then I
[00:40:09.410] bring it over to my desk where it's like quieter. Oh my god, that's so funny. With return to office, I'm like feeling these things a little bit more because what I've also been insecure about lately
[00:40:21.170] is when I work, I'll listen to like a podcast because it's like stimulating enough to kind of get me into the zone when I'm working. But the podcast that I listen to, I feel like sometimes
[00:40:31.090] can be a little bit on the immature side, shall I say? It's kind of like, oh, pop culture, like gossip, just like random stuff I can listen to in the background. When people like walk by my desk and
[00:40:42.930] like the little YouTube thing is open on my laptop screen or something, I just feel so awkward about it. So I like immediately hide it or I try to just like listen to it on my phone or something. But
[00:40:52.530] sometimes I'm like, I hope people can't tell that I'm listening to this podcast. That's so funny. Oh my god, I also talk to myself when I work sometimes. Oh my god, me too. Like I'm like
[00:41:03.090] muttering to myself like, oh dude, like this task is so annoying or like, oh fuck, I forgot something like go back in my files. And then sometimes when I'm doing that, I realize I'm like, oh shoot,
[00:41:13.970] I'm in the office. Like I hope no one has been listening to me just like muttering to myself. Oh my god. Well, yeah, I totally talk to myself too. But at work, I try not to because I'm like,
[00:41:25.890] it's like too close. Everyone's in too close of a proximity. Yeah. Okay, I have another insecurity. It's related to food again. We have different cafeterias where different food is served. And sometimes, you know, I look up what's getting served each day. I'm like, oh, today, you know
[00:41:44.610] what, I'm feeling like this particular cafeteria because they have a certain food or something. But then sometimes my co-workers or people around me will be like, oh, lunchtime, you guys want to
[00:41:56.770] grab, you know, they'll just stand up, like ask everyone around like, hey, anyone not eat yet? Like want to go get food? And it feels so rude to be like, no. Unless, of course, I've already eaten.
[00:42:10.930] Right. So I usually just end up saying like, oh, yeah, sure. I'll grab food with you guys. But then the issue is we don't go to the cafeteria that I want. And I'm like too shy to speak up for
[00:42:22.450] myself. Oh my god. Because I don't want to be like, oh my god, I'm so sorry, guys. But like, can we go to this one cafeteria, like walk all the way out of our building and walk to this other
[00:42:33.090] building to eat here? You know, and just like disrupt their lives. So I just take it. I just take the L. No, I feel like they wouldn't even mind. They probably like, oh, it's like a nice
[00:42:43.730] day to go on a walk. You're probably right. But I'm just like, I can't disrupt these people's lives. Actually, like corporate decisions regarding food are definitely awkward for me too,
[00:42:54.770] because one of the things that happens is at my company two days out of the week, you can get free lunch. But if you go into the office on a day that's not the free lunch days, then you have to
[00:43:05.730] get lunch for yourself basically. So sometimes with really big meetings, my entire team will go in. So we'll be like, oh, this is the perfect time to do a team lunch. But I don't know why,
[00:43:15.970] for some reason, I always get tasked with choosing their restaurant. Oh my god. And I'm just like, it's me again. Like I have to choose again. And it's not like we have a huge team and they're
[00:43:27.090] very cool about eating whatever, like always down for anything. So it's not like they're food critics. But I'm just like, what should I pick? Like, is it you know, should I pick something
[00:43:35.810] Asian? Or do we eat this last time? Or is this too fusion or whatever? So I always have to work that balance a little bit. Oh, yeah, no, that's hard. That's for sure hard. It's like decision
[00:43:46.370] paralysis. It is. Yeah. And it's a lot of pressure to and it's just like awkward. Like I have to just pass around my phone be like, you okay with this? You okay with this? You okay with this?
[00:43:55.650] Like I'm getting like a fucking vote or something. And they're probably all like, oh, yeah, anything's fine. And yeah, goddamn like, will they like it? I know maybe I have like a secret crystal on my
[00:44:07.330] team where they're like, oh, I actually want to eat at this restaurant. But they just can't speak up because they're like, Oh, she's already chose. I don't want to I don't want to step all over her
[00:44:16.770] like that. Exactly. It's like my greatest fear. But do you ever ask? Oh, does anyone have any cravings? Dude, I do. But I feel like everyone's so considerate. They're just like, oh, like I'm down forever. Like happy to eat anything, which is like a very nice response.
[00:44:32.610] But it's also just like doesn't help narrow any of the options down. Okay, I'm always just stuck at the GCU. I'm gonna send you an article and you should send it to your team. Oh my god, I read
[00:44:43.010] this recently. And it was like, decisive people are much more liked because if you are indecisive, then you always put the onus on other people to make decisions and then they feel pressure.
[00:44:58.850] Right? So if you can, like even if it's not a decision, but if you just toss something out there, you become more liked. Like on average. Interesting. Yeah, it's like a subconscious thing.
[00:45:11.570] That's actually good to know. But can you imagine if I fucking said that article in our team Slack like guys, I need you to read. Guys, look, I read this interesting article the other day.
[00:45:25.010] It's like the day you guys are choosing lunch. It's like at lunch. By the way, anyone craving any specific food today? Dude, I'm dead. But this makes so much sense because I feel like
[00:45:38.690] outside of work too, like any food group food decision, it gets lost in the chaos. And like no one will make a decision because everyone's trying to be quote unquote considerate. But ultimately, it's actually not considerate. Dude, yeah. And I think even beyond work groups,
[00:45:53.250] the decision making always lands on like one or two people. It's like the same people every time rallying everyone. Yeah. I remember once at work, we were gonna get a team lunch. And the theme was like trash food. So we were deciding between fast food joints. Someone was
[00:46:11.090] like, hey, anyone have any opinions on like, you know, what should we get like Taco Bell, McDonald's, stuff like that. And literally it was it was like so quiet. Oh, God. And I was like,
[00:46:24.850] ooh, like no one's making a decision. After like maybe 20 or 30 minutes with like no one responded. I was like, okay, to be fair. They also asked earlier, like, you know, anyway, so I manned up
[00:46:39.170] and I was like, guys, let's get Taco Bell. Oh, nice. And then it was almost like, you could almost feel the like sigh of relief. Everyone was like, oh my god. Yeah, that sounds great. Like
[00:46:50.370] down for Taco Bell. Awesome. Yeah. Dude, that's that's a power move right there. If I've ever seen one, I was like, someone has to make a decision. But also as someone who's always tasked
[00:47:02.930] with choosing, I feel like you also have to pose the question in a way where there's only two options. Otherwise, no one will ever choose. So usually I'll kind of comb through the restaurant
[00:47:11.650] list and be like, okay, do we want bun mee or do we want pizza? And then I just have them choose between the two things. Oh, okay. That's like pretty good because then you don't have to do the
[00:47:22.610] full decision. But everyone else can also feel like they participated. Right. It's actually kind of a system that I feel like has been working with some of my close friends as well. Like when
[00:47:33.330] we go to like a restaurant or something. Usually I feel like one of us will pull like three or so restaurants and the other person will like choose one. And I'm like, Oh, this is perfect, because
[00:47:43.170] both people have like a say in something. Nice. That's a pretty good system. I know our conversation got a little derailed here at the end. Do you like not just work stuff, but I think it was kind of fun
[00:47:55.170] to talk about our insecurities at work. And it's also interesting because some of these insecurities aren't necessarily just contained to work, but they're kind of like insecurities of life that just happen to also occur at work. And of course, there's also the work specific ones like, Oh my
[00:48:15.410] God, am I ready to do this for the rest of my life and all of that kind of stuff. Thank you, Jisoo, for joining me on this existential crisis of a conversation. And for our listeners out there,
