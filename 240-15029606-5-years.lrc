[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal
[00:00:13.740] This is a very special episode because
[00:00:20.050] It finally lined up to our official anniversary today as this episode is released it is our
[00:00:27.890] fifth year anniversary of having Eat Your Crust
[00:00:32.250] Yay!
[00:00:34.530] It feels a little bit surreal to say that because I think the podcast is just so integrated into our lifestyle that it's almost a part of our daily routine now
[00:00:43.890] So to think about all the different
[00:00:46.130] Years that we've accumulated into this project and that culminating into a five-year-old project literal kindergarten
[00:00:53.890] Dude, it's just crazy. It really is. Oh my god five years is longer than college
[00:01:01.850] It's longer than high school
[00:01:04.930] And I feel like for the most part not a ton has changed for us on the day to day
[00:01:09.450] But looking back we've made some pretty big strides in terms of how we organize stuff or even prepare for episodes or even
[00:01:16.570] Prepare our guests for episodes as well. Oh my god
[00:01:19.730] So true before we were more established just thinking back at the chaos that we were
[00:01:26.370] Operating under is insane because it didn't seem like chaos at the time although sometimes it did
[00:01:32.890] But once we started getting more and more organized every time we think back on those days
[00:01:38.050] It's like how are we doing this? I feel like the biggest change for us that has helped us be less chaotic
[00:01:44.930] Is we no longer
[00:01:47.050] Plan everything the week of oh my god basically we used to meet on Wednesdays which hasn't changed actually
[00:01:53.010] Oh, it has changed. Oh, yeah, it used to be Tuesdays
[00:01:55.850] Wait, it's now Tuesdays. Oh wait. No, you're right. You're right before you speak once
[00:02:00.490] But we submit on Wednesday to prepare for the recording that weekend
[00:02:04.850] Which I feel like if it was just us two
[00:02:06.610] It's fine
[00:02:06.970] But sometimes when you have to find a guest a lot of whom are like friends and have their own busy lifestyles and schedules
[00:02:12.650] It would just be ultimate chaos on like who is free to record this weekend
[00:02:16.850] And I think in the beginning there was definitely a period of time where we didn't even meet
[00:02:22.570] Right we just texted like oh my god should we ask this person to record in like two or three days?
[00:02:28.050] Oh my god
[00:02:29.690] There's actually some funny stories with this level of chaos one of our friends Brian is like a peak victim to this
[00:02:36.810] We basically
[00:02:38.410] Texted him and was like hey, are you free this weekend? We love to record an episode with you
[00:02:41.970] And he was like oh sure I'm down. What's the topic about and we were like, oh, we'll tell you when you like
[00:02:48.010] Oh
[00:02:49.170] My god showed up and we had some like we had a couple options for him
[00:02:53.170] But all of them were kind of serious and like dark and brooding kind of topic ideas
[00:02:57.930] And then I just remember he was like oh, I feel like a little bit nervous about this
[00:03:04.050] Yeah
[00:03:05.610] So we recorded a new episode with him recently
[00:03:09.490] It was the emotional outburst episode and before we started recording that one Brian was like wow
[00:03:16.090] I feel so much more prepared for this episode like you guys gave me an outline this time
[00:03:20.890] You told me the topic beforehand
[00:03:23.170] You asked me like a couple weeks in advance and we were like oh wait what happened last time?
[00:03:28.470] And he was like oh, I just kind of showed up
[00:03:31.650] It was handed a topic. Yeah, I
[00:03:34.770] Remember another really funny one. There's this one week where I think we had planned kind of ahead
[00:03:40.970] But it was only in our heads like oh, we'll ask this person on Tuesday or Wednesday to record on Saturday
[00:03:48.330] And then when we asked them they were like oh, sorry. I'm not free this weekend and we were like wait
[00:03:54.010] We're stupid. Why did we just assume this person would be free?
[00:03:57.850] And so we were like kind of panicking and we're thinking like oh shoot
[00:04:02.250] Should we do like a two-person episode then or should we look for other potential guests?
[00:04:08.330] We ended up asking someone on I believe it was like Thursday if they could record with us on Friday
[00:04:16.410] Literally the next day and luckily they were like yeah, okay. I can do that
[00:04:22.010] Dude we have some absolute angels for friends truly. We're much better about it now but back then
[00:04:30.010] Yeah, I'm like why did these people say yes to us?
[00:04:33.770] I remember when we were discussing this topic idea on our call earlier
[00:04:38.250] You mentioned the way we used to do our podcast was like living paycheck to paycheck. Oh my god completely unsustainable
[00:04:45.130] It's so difficult. There's no like episode bank or anything like that that we can rely on and it would really fuck us over
[00:04:50.490] Anytime we needed to travel. Oh, yeah
[00:04:52.810] So actually during COVID times it wasn't as bad but the era right before COVID
[00:04:58.450] I feel like it was really hard to make sure that episodes were
[00:05:01.650] Pre-recorded before we went traveling so we're much better about it now, but that was a big challenge for us in the past
[00:05:07.650] Oh, yeah, for sure. And I think COVID actually helped us a lot in a sense because before
[00:05:14.290] We always recorded things in person
[00:05:17.010] And so scheduling was a little harder and we were a little more limited to like people locally
[00:05:22.690] And also just like friends people who we would trust to come into our homes, you know
[00:05:28.850] but COVID kind of forced us to start planning ahead more and then also
[00:05:34.050] Find a solution to record remotely
[00:05:36.850] Which to this day has helped us a lot because now scheduling is a lot easier because we can be like
[00:05:41.570] Yeah, we can record remotely or you know, if you live in the bay
[00:05:45.570] Then we can figure out a time to record in person if that's a preference
[00:05:51.330] Right. I think we did definitely get all of our scheduling under control during the COVID times
[00:05:57.410] Which was good because scheduling was much easier during COVID because people were less busy
[00:06:02.530] Probably most people weren't traveling and we're just at home
[00:06:05.730] So now that travel is back in full force
[00:06:08.930] I think we're much better prepared and honestly, I feel like you and I are both people who travel fairly frequently
[00:06:15.970] And the trips aren't always short like usually when we travel it's like at least a week or two
[00:06:20.770] So being prepared in advance has helped so much. Yeah
[00:06:24.210] I think it's also really funny though when we do travel and then we like podcast remotely while we're traveling
[00:06:30.770] Another pro to figuring out the whole remote recording situation
[00:06:34.930] I remember there's definitely been some trips where
[00:06:38.450] I don't know a cabin trip or something or just like a quick weekend trip
[00:06:42.690] Where i'm like, oh, yeah, I can sneak away and record in the morning when everyone's still sleeping
[00:06:48.530] Dude, actually you're really good about doing podcast recordings while you're traveling
[00:06:52.210] I feel like it's so hard for me. Like I need to be in my podcast space to able to do this podcast
[00:06:57.250] I think it's because I have a lot of free time when I travel and also sometimes I'm traveling alone
[00:07:02.290] So it's like way easier to accommodate
[00:07:05.090] But yeah, definitely if I'm traveling with other people or like maybe to a new place
[00:07:08.850] Then it's a little harder to like schedule that in or with like a crazy time difference
[00:07:13.970] True
[00:07:14.850] I remember at one point last year when I went to Japan and Korea
[00:07:19.410] And then we were planning our podcasting schedule and I was like, hmm. I guess like worst case
[00:07:25.410] I could maybe record out there
[00:07:29.570] If like, you know morning is evening for us
[00:07:32.690] But luckily I think we figured it out and we're like, okay. Thank god
[00:07:35.730] We were able to like slot everything in perfectly
[00:07:38.930] Dude, yeah, I feel like every time you're going on a trip and you're like, oh, it's fine
[00:07:42.530] I can just pack a mic. I'm like crystal no
[00:07:46.290] Save your precious vacation time
[00:07:49.250] Oh, but going back to our beginning recording chaos
[00:07:54.370] I also just thought of a funny situation which is our very first episode
[00:08:00.530] With Tiffany that episode we talked about like friendship and I remember this so specifically because
[00:08:07.730] You know, we're just starting things up
[00:08:09.810] And then to be was kind enough to be like, yeah, I'm down to record the first episode with you all
[00:08:15.010] And she was like, so what's the topic?
[00:08:16.610] And I think we did have the topics like oh, you know friendship
[00:08:19.730] And then she's like, okay cool. We just went and then we just winged it like there was no outline
[00:08:25.730] No idea, I guess no general idea is just like, oh, yeah
[00:08:29.730] We'll talk about friendship like how vague and broad is that
[00:08:33.490] I think we ended up rerecording that one too actually
[00:08:36.610] Dude, and that was literally at not necessarily a party but like a bigger friend group hang out
[00:08:41.330] So we were hanging out with a bunch of our other friends
[00:08:43.730] And then chrystal me and tiffani
[00:08:45.730] We were like hold up brb for one second and we just like locked ourselves in our room
[00:08:50.450] And recorded the episode for like 30 40 minutes. Maybe dude. You're so right
[00:08:55.250] I actually totally forgot about that and in that original recording
[00:08:59.410] There was like some very slight background sounds of people like I think they're playing 2k in the
[00:09:05.650] living room
[00:09:07.650] Dude, but now despite being way better and way more organized
[00:09:13.170] There still are the rare very very rare bliffs
[00:09:18.050] And it actually happened recently which was kind of crazy
[00:09:21.970] But basically we recorded an episode and you know all was really good
[00:09:27.010] I get on maybe like a week later to edit it
[00:09:31.010] I pull it up and i'm like wait
[00:09:33.810] My like me my audio is
[00:09:37.410] silent
[00:09:39.170] And I was like, okay. Are my speakers broken? Like what's going on here?
[00:09:43.010] And i'm like dude reality is setting in and i'm like holy shit. I fucked up
[00:09:49.810] My audio did not record
[00:09:51.810] And it was such a crazy experience too because i was like, okay
[00:09:55.730] I guess like the only solution here is to try and remember exactly what I said
[00:10:00.930] And just listen to you know, what jisoo and our guest was saying
[00:10:04.770] And then I will just try to respond as close to the original wording as I could because they would respond again
[00:10:11.650] Right and it can't make like no sense
[00:10:14.370] Wow, that was like truly an interesting experience
[00:10:17.810] When I got your text when you were like, oh, shit. I have bad news
[00:10:21.090] Like my audio didn't record my heart fucking dropped
[00:10:24.210] But when you sent me the final edit with your newly re-recorded audio and stuff
[00:10:29.090] I was almost like I can't even tell like it's actually so
[00:10:32.770] Good like the way you piece together everything with context clues
[00:10:37.010] And I think the turnover was relatively recent like we had just recorded that episode like fairly recently
[00:10:43.570] So at least it was like top of mind. Yeah, but I was like, I don't know how she how she did that like that was crazy
[00:10:50.530] Dude, I there were definitely some small chunks where I was like, oh my god
[00:10:56.050] I actually just don't remember what I said here. So I will have to cut myself out from here
[00:11:03.010] You were silent. Yeah
[00:11:05.890] Indeed, okay one of the hardest parts of that was like, you know
[00:11:09.570] I listened to the front part and then there's the silence of where I'm supposed to talk
[00:11:13.250] And I listened to the the like response, right? And I'm like, oh my god
[00:11:17.410] Why is jisoo and I guess laughing like what did I say?
[00:11:21.330] I'm like, no, what did I say? Like, what is the joke? I don't know
[00:11:25.730] Hey, but you did it pretty good. Like I remember you texted me. Oh god, you're laughing
[00:11:29.810] Like I have no idea what the joke was and then later when I heard the edit
[00:11:33.570] It was the exact joke that you had said. Oh my god. Like it made perfect sense to me and I was like, dude
[00:11:39.010] That's wild. That's muscle memory right there
[00:11:41.650] Man, but that was a lesson learned now. I'm like, okay, I can never make that mistake again
[00:11:47.250] Like at least on the bright side it was me
[00:11:50.530] Versus like if it was our guests that would be so bad
[00:11:53.650] If it was like one of us slightly better
[00:11:56.530] But the first thing that came to my mind was like, oh my god
[00:11:59.410] Do we have to call up our guests and be like, hey, we we need to re-record this entire episode
[00:12:05.250] I kind of thought that we might but you know, it turned out so seamless
[00:12:09.410] But I'm glad we didn't have to and I think it was also kind of high pressure because
[00:12:13.890] I was about to leave on a trip too. So this was one of our like backlog episodes
[00:12:18.610] Actually, this is something super sweet that chrystal did but since james and I were leaving for a honeymoon
[00:12:23.730] chrystal edited four episodes or something within like one week
[00:12:28.290] And made sure that I could do all the editing and whatnot before I left so that I didn't have to do podcast stuff on the
[00:12:34.130] trip was just super sweet, but this was the last episode we had just recorded and it was like, holy shit like we
[00:12:41.650] We have like 12 hours to get this done
[00:12:46.290] Oh my god, but luckily we pulled through
[00:12:51.330] I wonder if our listeners can guess which episode it is if they can tell not just guess actually if they can tell
[00:12:59.410] Hopefully not. Yeah, hopefully not but dms if you think you know, yeah
[00:13:04.050] But I think what you mentioned
[00:13:06.050] Kind of reminds me too of one of the things that we had to get used to once we started this podcast was
[00:13:11.490] almost kind of like guest management
[00:13:13.890] So I think in
[00:13:15.650] One sense a lot of our guests tend to be our close friends
[00:13:19.330] It's really cool in the way that it's a little bit more casual more comfortable
[00:13:24.130] You know our communication is just like super informal and like messenger text or something
[00:13:28.530] And it also has the positive impact of like
[00:13:31.730] Okay, this recording is basically like a hangout where we can like talk about something
[00:13:36.130] But in the other sense whenever we had guests who were external people
[00:13:41.250] I felt like we had to kind of get used to communicating with them as well because maybe they have less context into our podcast
[00:13:47.970] Maybe they have a different sense of what
[00:13:51.410] They want to talk about or how they want to talk about the topic
[00:13:54.530] So then I remember we kind of had to curate like the way we describe our podcast and introduce ourselves
[00:14:01.090] And also kind of like levels that expectations with guests who aren't in our like immediate social network
[00:14:06.690] So true. I think the first couple times we were like, what did we say last time again?
[00:14:11.570] How do we describe yourselves?
[00:14:13.650] And then eventually we just wrote it down on a doc
[00:14:15.890] We're like, okay, these are the points we have to hit to make sure that you know our guests will understand everything
[00:14:21.810] I think things got a lot smoother from there
[00:14:24.530] And I think it also makes us really try extra hard on our outlines
[00:14:29.090] So for context before an episode we always
[00:14:32.450] Write out some sort of guideline so that we know in general like what sub topics
[00:14:39.250] Part of the bigger topic that we're going to talk about and you know, if people want feel more comfortable writing notes
[00:14:44.930] Then they're welcome to do that
[00:14:46.930] And I think in general it has made people feel more prepared
[00:14:50.690] When they feel more prepared, they're more comfortable on the podcast too. So it you know, it just it just improves the flow overall
[00:14:57.650] And I think it's always just such a nice thing to hear when we get external guests and they're like, oh, this is like a really good outline
[00:15:06.850] I know there's actually no bigger compliment and
[00:15:10.130] In the beginning we definitely did not hear these comments
[00:15:13.090] But more so recently I feel like people often say like the way you guys do your logistical details
[00:15:19.250] Or like walk us through the outline and you know have these conversations about topic ideas is like
[00:15:24.370] Professional so that I'm just like holy fuck. This is major growth from the days where we would just jump scare our guests
[00:15:32.610] We're like, oh shit. We're professionals now like yeah
[00:15:35.810] We have a whole routine
[00:15:38.610] We've got like a whole process for everything
[00:15:42.050] I think also at the same time it makes us feel better
[00:15:45.170] If we know that we've done everything that we need to
[00:15:48.050] And you know all of our boxes are checked then all that's left is to just focus on the recording and the topic at hand
[00:15:54.770] Yeah, definitely low key sometimes it kind of makes me laugh because I feel like we have this
[00:16:00.690] Rhythm that we get into when we you know meet an external guest for the first time and do our like preliminary chat with them
[00:16:07.330] Like you said we kind of have like almost like a sop or like some sort of documentation on what we should talk about
[00:16:12.370] At this point it's like memorized and I feel like it's almost like an unofficial script of
[00:16:16.610] Oh, you'll walk through this part and then I walk through this section or blah blah
[00:16:20.930] Sometimes we like swap and I feel like it kind of throws us off or something and that always makes me laugh because I'm just like
[00:16:27.170] Damn, it's such small subtle things that only we would know because we've been doing this for five years
[00:16:32.930] But I don't know just like cool like behind the scenes details about like who owns which lines of like our intro doc, you know
[00:16:39.890] Yeah
[00:16:41.570] Oh man as we talk over this. I'm just like wow
[00:16:45.090] We've come so far
[00:16:48.130] We have
[00:16:49.410] Yeah, and sometimes I feel like our friends ask us they're like, oh, how's the podcast going?
[00:16:54.210] I'm like, yeah, you know, it's still like it's good. It's going
[00:16:57.570] I guess because like now that everything is
[00:17:00.530] pretty organized and like you said we
[00:17:04.290] Just kind of have a rhythm for things
[00:17:06.610] It like takes up less brain space in terms of you know that more like
[00:17:11.650] organization and like
[00:17:13.170] Planning side. So I guess when we really sit down and talk about it. I'm like, oh, shit
[00:17:17.410] Yeah, we actually plan and organize a lot like we kind of do a lot
[00:17:21.970] And I actually helped so much because like you said it's less mental space because we prepare beforehand
[00:17:27.810] And then I feel like also it's less
[00:17:29.970] Anxiety inducing like we have less of those moments where we're like, oh, shit
[00:17:32.930] We need to scramble for a guest for sure
[00:17:35.090] I think one of the things that I feel like has helped us a lot in the last five years is
[00:17:40.050] For some reason we just don't run out of like stuff to talk about and I think that's like one of the most common questions
[00:17:46.050] My friends will ask me they're like, how do you guys?
[00:17:48.370] You know keep a podcast going for five years
[00:17:50.850] Like don't you run out of things to say and I'm just like I feel like there's so many
[00:17:54.930] Minute details that we go through in our lives that we like find interesting or funny
[00:18:00.530] And it's like something that you and I would totally text about
[00:18:03.330] And then we just draw all that shit down on like an idea board and that's like our podcast
[00:18:08.850] Yeah, like sometimes it's just what's top of mind. We're obsessed with this current thing. Let's you know talk about it
[00:18:15.490] Yeah, but I agree
[00:18:16.770] I get that question a lot and I don't even know how to answer it. I'm just like, oh, I don't know. I guess we just haven't
[00:18:22.930] Like we just haven't run out of things yet
[00:18:26.370] Professional yappers
[00:18:29.810] This is our safe space to yapp about whatever we want
[00:18:33.570] And then we drag our friends into it too. We're like, hey, do you want to talk about such and such?
[00:18:40.370] They're like, um, okay. I guess so
[00:18:42.530] Dude, but it's really nice honestly
[00:18:44.210] And I feel like we're very lucky to have a group of friends who are one willing to help us and participate in this project with us
[00:18:51.410] But two just our friends have interesting stuff to say and they have interesting experiences to talk about and
[00:18:57.490] Even beyond our friends like people
[00:19:00.450] We have guessed it in the past just have
[00:19:02.930] All of this information and like experiences that maybe you and I don't have and I just I'm always like fascinated when we do an episode
[00:19:10.930] Where I'm like people think so differently from me and also they have such different lived experiences and lives from me
[00:19:18.050] So then I feel like it feels a lot more fulfilling and interesting
[00:19:21.650] Oh my god, for sure. And I think to your point about you know chatting with our friends
[00:19:27.250] There's definitely a lot of things that come up on the podcast that
[00:19:31.330] We would have never even known about our friends if we didn't you know, choose to talk about this certain topic with them
[00:19:37.890] I mean, I can't think of one off the top of my head right now
[00:19:40.690] But you know, it's just like the fact that we're like putting aside
[00:19:45.090] couple hours each weekend to kind of deep dive on
[00:19:49.330] Some random or maybe top-of-mind topic with one of our friends usually
[00:19:54.370] We just you know hear stories that we normally wouldn't and usually it's it's just like really
[00:19:59.890] Eye-opening I think because sometimes our topics
[00:20:03.570] Especially lately have been like, oh my god, like we're we're getting older. Like what are we doing with our lives?
[00:20:09.810] And then it's like, oh shoot everyone else is going through this too
[00:20:12.770] But you know, maybe we don't talk about that as much in our day to day hangouts
[00:20:17.010] And so it's just nice to be like, okay cool. You are also experiencing some crazy shit like us
[00:20:23.090] Or not crazy damn. That's like a really good point actually
[00:20:26.690] I don't know what it is necessarily about the podcast
[00:20:30.050] Space that makes it easier to open up about stuff like that
[00:20:33.010] But it does seem like it puts us all into a mindset of wanting to have deep conversations and like talk about our feelings and open up
[00:20:40.450] And to be honest, it's also not easy right to like share all of these different private details about your life
[00:20:47.090] And about your emotions things that might in the normal social space make you feel super vulnerable
[00:20:53.170] So, you know, we're definitely blessed to also have these people
[00:20:56.930] Who are gracious enough to like really dive deep into things like this when I think the instinct is to kind of hide it away
[00:21:03.650] Yeah, true
[00:21:05.010] I guess essentially a lot of our podcast is
[00:21:07.890] You know sharing stories with each other and I think this is a value that we've talked about
[00:21:13.250] Behind the scenes a lot too, which is relating with each other
[00:21:16.850] you know finding that point of
[00:21:18.690] Relateability and luckily I think a lot of our listeners also are able to relate to this
[00:21:24.610] And I think it kind of just makes everyone feel a little less alone in certain experiences
[00:21:30.770] Yeah, I think that's very true
[00:21:32.210] And I think that is also one of the joys of trying to come up with or like dive deep into certain topics
[00:21:39.490] We really try to go for things that match up with our core values and what we believe our podcast represents
[00:21:45.890] But also things that we feel like our listeners might relate to or oftentimes
[00:21:50.210] Episode ideas that listeners even DM us to discuss
[00:21:53.890] You know as much as it's a personal project between you and me
[00:21:57.570] I feel like it also includes heavily like our friends and it also includes heavily our listeners as well for sure
[00:22:04.930] I think it's like very rewarding too
[00:22:07.490] It really does feel like we deepen our connection with our friends in some sense and
[00:22:14.130] You know learn a lot from the more external guests and it's very nice to
[00:22:20.690] hear that
[00:22:21.890] Our listeners have been enjoying it and that they can relate to
[00:22:25.970] It provides like I guess a little bit of like a sense of community
[00:22:30.770] Yeah, true
[00:22:31.970] And also one of the I think unspoken joys about our episode planning and like topic selections
[00:22:38.610] Is I find it really fun to come up with a topic
[00:22:41.570] And then like map it to a close friend who we feel like would be the perfect guest for that topic
[00:22:46.450] Yes, I feel like it's almost something that requires a lot of thought but at the same time. It's very just instinctive
[00:22:52.850] It's like I know this person would be a good fit and like I don't have to necessarily articulate it because you also get the vibes as well
[00:22:59.170] So I feel like that exercise is always like a hidden joy of our weekly meetings. Oh my god
[00:23:04.370] Good point. I think that's another question we get a lot from our friends
[00:23:08.450] Like, oh, how do you choose the topic? How do you choose the guest because I'm sure from their perspective
[00:23:14.210] It's like a little random, right? It's like crystal and jiso asked me to be on the pod
[00:23:18.610] I wonder why they chose this topic or I wonder why they chose me
[00:23:21.890] It's basically what you said we usually either curate a topic and then we're like
[00:23:26.770] Oh, who would be good for this topic or we know that we want one of our friends on
[00:23:32.370] And we'll be like, oh, what is like a good topic for this friend
[00:23:35.890] Yeah, the reverse part is very fun too. I feel like it
[00:23:41.490] Requires you to know your friend very well in some senses and then it also can be like an opportunity to learn more about them through that specific topic too
[00:23:50.690] Like not necessarily like oh, I'm gonna have this friend on for this topic because he or she is an expert
[00:23:56.290] Sometimes they just fit the vibe of like what we want to go for for that episode if it's like playful or funny or deep and sensitive
[00:24:03.570] So there's just like a lot of vibe matching
[00:24:07.090] That happens behind the scenes
[00:24:09.250] I will admit though some of it is learned through experience
[00:24:13.410] I think you know back in the beginning of the pod
[00:24:16.610] No matter what people are going to be a little different in front of the microphone versus, you know out there in the world
[00:24:23.010] We definitely did I don't know. I guess like internal calibration to match, you know
[00:24:28.210] Someone's on mic personality with the topics and there have definitely been a lot of like pleasant surprises too
[00:24:35.970] Maybe someone who we
[00:24:38.050] anticipated to be
[00:24:39.410] A little more quiet or reserved ended up being like a superstar on the mic or even someone who's normally
[00:24:46.210] More silly ends up being like much more
[00:24:50.450] Profound, you know for some reason give them a mic and they become like hey welcome to my TED talk
[00:24:58.530] So I I'm just thinking of like some of our happy accidents is sometimes when we pair people up
[00:25:04.610] So for our four person episodes one of the episodes that we continuously find to be super funny
[00:25:11.890] Is like that one with jimmy and I where we talked about
[00:25:16.130] DTR defining the relationship. I think that was a covid episode too
[00:25:20.770] We were like, oh these two know each other
[00:25:23.010] We're all part of like bigger friend group
[00:25:25.330] Let's just try it out put them together and see how the episode goes and we were like, oh my god
[00:25:29.810] Wait, that was like amazing perfect chemistry awesome
[00:25:34.370] That one was so funny. Honestly
[00:25:37.170] I would highly recommend anyone to go back and listen to that episode because we literally made them act out break ups with each other
[00:25:45.090] I feel like another type of episode that I also enjoy recording a lot is our girl talk episodes
[00:25:51.410] There's just so much about it that brings me joy like one recording with girlfriends always such a pleasure
[00:25:56.850] Sometimes during girl talk episodes
[00:25:58.370] we do mix people from like different friend groups or different walks of life and
[00:26:02.930] You know anytime we've done something like that
[00:26:04.850] It always ends up with like an amazing episode where people just
[00:26:08.690] Relate to each other in our womanhood and our femininity and just what we experience as women
[00:26:14.050] But it's also just fun like especially our four person girl talk episodes
[00:26:17.810] Everyone chimes in everyone has an opinion and I feel like it's always like a fun and fast paced episode
[00:26:23.170] So most recently we did one with jane and cindy talking about
[00:26:27.730] Situationships and that was also a really fun and memorable one for me
[00:26:31.410] I think it's also cool that we've like I guess unintentionally or intentionally
[00:26:36.690] Mixed friend groups of it through the pod
[00:26:39.490] I think also it's cool because other people
[00:26:42.530] Maybe know of our other friends because of a podcast episode
[00:26:46.690] I'm like, oh, yeah, I do know that friend that random friend that you mentioned because I heard their episode or something of that sort
[00:26:53.650] Which I always think is like very interesting and funny
[00:26:57.490] I know I I feel like at our bachelorette party
[00:27:01.330] Even if people hadn't met each other like they were familiar with each other's episodes
[00:27:05.970] And stuff like that and I was like this is such a cool and like
[00:27:08.690] unintentional side effect of having a podcast like this where we feature our friends
[00:27:13.090] It's like it does give a sort of bonding experience
[00:27:16.210] Like maybe you haven't listened to this person's episode necessarily but you've both been guests on the podcast
[00:27:21.170] So in that way you already have like a shared experience to talk about. Yeah
[00:27:25.010] Oh my god
[00:27:25.810] There was a funny moment at your batch weekend when someone was like, all right
[00:27:30.530] Everyone introduce yourselves and name your favorite episode of
[00:27:33.970] Eater crust and I feel like everyone said the one that they were featured on
[00:27:41.410] So funny
[00:27:42.610] And I think along the veins of mixing friend groups
[00:27:45.890] I feel like I have essentially met almost all of your friends
[00:27:49.250] So here this podcast and vice versa for you as well
[00:27:52.770] So then I think it gives me a lot of context on like you and your friendships to just on like a personal level
[00:27:58.610] And I find it really cool actually because it's a very rare and like specific
[00:28:03.330] Experience to be able to do that like meet all of your friends closest friends
[00:28:07.490] So in that way, I am grateful for this podcast and like just seeing your dynamics with all your friends is very fascinating
[00:28:13.570] Oh my god
[00:28:14.210] Wait, that's such a good point because at your wedding. I remember I was like wait
[00:28:18.850] I low-key know everyone here because
[00:28:21.650] Because of the podcast
[00:28:23.970] Actually
[00:28:25.810] I guess you'll have a similar experience in the future
[00:28:28.930] Yes, exactly
[00:28:31.170] I think it's also funny because like if there is maybe someone who
[00:28:35.890] You didn't meet or I didn't meet that they still know of you
[00:28:40.610] Or me I guess because they're like, oh, aren't you like the person who does the podcast with jisoo or something like that
[00:28:47.010] It's so funny too because it's almost like, you know how you introduce say a significant other, right?
[00:28:52.930] It's like, oh, you know this person is like very attached to my life
[00:28:56.450] Blah blah it's like someone for friends to like really know and then it's almost like you're at that level too because it's like
[00:29:03.730] It's like, yeah
[00:29:04.930] I almost expect people to know or have an inkling of who you are because this podcast and like being so embedded in my life
[00:29:14.210] Dude, I know exactly what you mean
[00:29:16.370] Usually when you talk about your friend or you like you mentioned
[00:29:18.850] Oh, I went to dinner with this person or whatever to someone who doesn't know that person
[00:29:22.050] You're like, I went with my friend chrystal, but I feel like it doesn't need that like intro anymore
[00:29:27.570] I'm just like, oh, I went with chrystal even to people who don't know you and 99% of the time they like they're like, oh, yeah
[00:29:32.770] You're like podcast
[00:29:34.770] I'm like, yeah
[00:29:36.850] It's so funny. I'm like damn jisoo is basically like my podcast significant other
[00:29:43.890] The word of five-year-long relationship
[00:29:46.290] But also speaking of like, you know knowing about this podcast and our friendships and stuff
[00:29:52.530] I always think it's so funny when
[00:29:55.490] When I see a friend and they're like, it's so nice to catch up. I'm so sorry
[00:30:00.130] I haven't listened to your podcast in a while
[00:30:02.850] And I'm like, dude, it's totally fine
[00:30:04.930] I don't even like it's not an issue if you don't listen or if you listen
[00:30:08.770] But I think it's so funny when they're like, oh my god. I'm so sorry like I haven't listened to anything recently
[00:30:14.210] Wait, yeah, I've had so many conversations like that with my friends too. They're like, oh, sorry
[00:30:18.370] I'm like a couple episodes behind. I'm like, there's literally zero need to apologize
[00:30:23.330] There's no obligation to me as a friend to keep up
[00:30:26.770] I'm like, dude, don't worry. We hang out in person like, you know podcast stories and all of that stuff you get to
[00:30:33.250] learn in person instead of through like your headphones
[00:30:37.490] But then I feel like sometimes there's just kind of like silly or funny moments because of that because
[00:30:43.250] You know, occasionally I'll be talking to a friend and I'll tell some story and she's like, oh, yeah
[00:30:47.330] Like I heard that on your podcast and I was like, oh, sorry to like repeat the story and make you rehear it
[00:30:52.770] But then later, you know, I'm like, okay, this person like tunes into the podcast usually
[00:30:57.650] So I'll just briefly reference the story and not like give the full, you know run down and I'll be like, yeah
[00:31:03.410] Like I know I mentioned this on the podcast
[00:31:05.570] But you know this happens so blah blah and I'll move on and then she's like, oh
[00:31:09.410] I'm not like caught up actually like what's the story and I'm like fog. I can never get it exactly right
[00:31:15.090] You're like damn now. I sound like an asshole like, oh, you know on the podcast
[00:31:20.450] Like did you not listen?
[00:31:23.010] I also think it's funny when people maybe like you haven't seen someone in a while
[00:31:28.210] You know, you go and hang out with them and they're like, oh dude
[00:31:30.530] I listened to like the most recent two episodes or something
[00:31:34.050] To like prep for our hangout and I'm like, oh dude, you really didn't need to do that
[00:31:38.450] Wait, I'm dead
[00:31:40.530] I've also had so many hangouts where I'm like, hey, how are you?
[00:31:43.970] And then the person is like, oh, I'm good. How are you?
[00:31:46.210] And then they're immediately launched into like, okay
[00:31:48.290] I listened to your most recent episode and hear all my thoughts and opinions and feelings about it
[00:31:52.530] And I'm just like holy fuck. It's like such a weird feeling
[00:31:55.410] But I'm just so grateful that people
[00:31:57.890] Feel so much when they listen to certain episodes of our podcast
[00:32:01.650] Because I feel like it's one thing to just like tune in and kind of listen to a podcast on background noise but
[00:32:07.650] To have all these thoughts and feelings like takes a lot of emotional energy
[00:32:11.410] So I always appreciate when people, you know, mention
[00:32:14.530] Whatever remarks that they had while listening to the episode. Yeah, I think ultimately it's like not an issue if our friends don't listen
[00:32:22.930] But at the same time you're right
[00:32:24.210] It is nice and cool if someone does listen and then they have like more to add on
[00:32:29.090] Because then it's kind of like a conversation starter, which I think everyone maybe appreciates
[00:32:34.930] But of course, you know every hangout is not a book club for our podcast episodes
[00:32:39.090] So like please don't feel stress if you're our friends to like, you know, listen to everything
[00:32:44.050] 100%
[00:32:45.170] Ultimately it's kind of almost like a hobby, you know, like we don't have to talk about it
[00:32:49.810] We can talk about it. There's no pressure from anything
[00:32:53.810] Yeah, definitely
[00:32:55.010] I think there's pros and cons to both sides whether your friend listens to it or not
[00:32:59.410] It's like if they do tune in then you can choose to talk about the episodes if you want
[00:33:04.370] But if they don't then you can still talk about maybe stuff that came up in the episodes or whatever
[00:33:09.090] But it doesn't have to be like, oh, this was on my podcast. Well, blah
[00:33:12.690] So I think it's a nice plus
[00:33:15.410] But as you said definitely not something that we feel entitled to at all
[00:33:19.650] Oh my god
[00:33:20.130] But speaking of like talking about podcast episodes, this might be kind of crazy, but
[00:33:27.010] sometimes
[00:33:28.370] when I
[00:33:29.730] am like
[00:33:30.930] Going to therapy and I need to like I'm thinking of what to share in therapy
[00:33:36.450] Sometimes I refer back to our episodes in my mind not like in the session but like in my mind
[00:33:41.970] I'm like, hmm. Is there anything that we talked about on the podcast recently that I think I should bring up with my therapist
[00:33:51.090] Wait, holy shit
[00:33:54.130] So it's like breathing in spo
[00:33:57.090] For your therapy sessions
[00:33:58.770] Yeah, you know like how we did that crisis episode
[00:34:01.810] So I'll be like, hmm. Is there something that I missed there that I should talk, you know
[00:34:06.210] About with my therapist or stuff like that and then sometimes I'm like, I should just treat this therapy session as like a podcast recording
[00:34:18.030] Okay, I don't know I sometimes have the fear of like a run out of shit to say at therapy
[00:34:23.390] So I'm like, okay. I should just like treat it like a podcast session
[00:34:27.150] It's a regular conversation. Like it's all good
[00:34:30.030] And it like low key helps
[00:34:32.350] Damn, that's hella funny
[00:34:33.790] I think I know what you mean
[00:34:34.990] Definitely when we do more of like those sensitive and like deeper emotional topic episodes
[00:34:40.510] I do kind of mentally note like oh, maybe I should bring this up in therapy or sometimes it's like indirect too
[00:34:45.470] Right, it's like we can be talking about some sort of completely random topic
[00:34:49.710] But as we do that episode it makes me like feel certain emotions where I'm like question mark
[00:34:54.750] And then I'm like, okay. I I should probably take this to my therapist. Yeah, like low mental note
[00:35:00.670] Right bring this up next week
[00:35:04.190] But in general like I can kind of relate to what you said about treating something like a podcast episode
[00:35:09.950] Because I feel like it's helped
[00:35:12.270] A lot for me. I'm someone who has struggled with public speaking and just like feeling really nervous when I talk
[00:35:18.910] And honestly just like struggling with even small talk and whatnot
[00:35:22.670] But I feel like with podcasting one just
[00:35:26.270] Meeting and like having two hour conversations with all these different people
[00:35:30.590] And two just having these conversations on a regular basis
[00:35:34.110] Has actually helped a ton. I've noticed it a little bit in meetings, right?
[00:35:37.870] But I kind of chalked it up to like, oh, maybe it's just because I'm
[00:35:41.710] Five years deep into my career now. So like I'm more used to talking in meetings and whatnot
[00:35:45.950] But when I really noticed it was during our wedding
[00:35:49.390] We did our vows to each other. Oh, yeah
[00:35:52.190] And because there's like a hundred and something people like sitting there in front of me
[00:35:56.910] I thought that I would be really really nervous
[00:35:59.310] But honestly standing up there on the altar with james in front of me
[00:36:02.910] You by my side all of our bridesmaids and groomsmen near us and mike in hand
[00:36:06.990] I was like, I'm literally doing like a podcast episode and I did not feel nervous at all doing the vow
[00:36:11.870] Dude
[00:36:12.990] That's so funny. Like the moment the mike is put in your hand, you're like, oh, I know this feeling. Yeah, exactly
[00:36:20.190] Meanwhile james like shaking
[00:36:23.710] Just kidding. I don't know if he was actually shaking
[00:36:27.470] I think because I was sort of used to the podcast feeling
[00:36:30.350] It probably prevented me from like tearing up a little bit more too because I'm like, oh, I'm just like podcasting
[00:36:35.390] Like I wouldn't normally cry during a podcast episode
[00:36:37.710] You're like, I'm so ready for this very steady
[00:36:40.590] I remember when you were saying your vows, you were like
[00:36:43.950] So composed and everyone was like, oh my god, jisoo was so good at giving her vows
[00:36:49.790] And then actually later during the wedding our parents and then our made of honor best man came up and did their speeches
[00:36:55.870] And then at the end james and I were supposed to give a speech
[00:36:58.830] I looked over at james and he was like, I think you should just do the speech like the thank you speech
[00:37:03.150] And I was like, okay
[00:37:03.790] And I just stood up with the mic and I like gave the thank you speech just off the dome
[00:37:07.550] I was like, damn, I don't think I could have done this without five years of eat your crust experience
[00:37:11.950] Dude, that's character development
[00:37:15.150] Who is she?
[00:37:17.230] Oh my god, that's so awesome
[00:37:18.990] Speaking of, you know how it's like kind of trained a muscle within us. I do remember
[00:37:24.830] When we first started podcasting
[00:37:27.470] After each recording I would be exhausted
[00:37:31.070] It was just like an hour or maybe like two max of having a conversation
[00:37:36.430] And if you think about it, you're like, okay
[00:37:38.830] I shouldn't be exhausted at the end of this because we're just sitting down with our good friends and we're chatting
[00:37:44.910] But I would be exhausted and I remember one time I asked you I was like, dude
[00:37:48.430] Just me or like I'm super tired after this recording and you're like, dude. I literally took a nap like I'm so tired
[00:37:55.070] I guess you know over time as we practiced by doing more podcasts
[00:38:00.510] I like don't get that fatigue as much now. I actually sometimes after our recording, I'm like more awake
[00:38:07.790] True. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like it used to take way more like
[00:38:11.550] Brainpower or something or maybe we were just like more tense and stiff and like nervous
[00:38:16.990] I do feel like the way we approach podcast recording now is a little bit more casual than maybe when we first started
[00:38:22.670] But yeah, I feel like back then anytime we pressed the recording button. It was like tense shoulders like
[00:38:28.830] clogged the road just like shaking hands
[00:38:32.030] Oh my god
[00:38:32.830] I remember one time
[00:38:34.750] I think it was like I was out earlier in the day for
[00:38:38.990] I don't know someone's birthday or something of that sort
[00:38:42.270] And so I got back and this was when I was in New York
[00:38:44.670] So I got back it was a little later in the day and we were doing our podcast recording
[00:38:49.150] And because it was like, you know, I was out celebrating earlier. I was, you know, just a little tipsy
[00:38:55.150] And when I like went back later to edit the episode. I was like wait, I'm like popping off on this episode
[00:39:02.430] I was like damn like I'm looser. I'm asking good questions
[00:39:06.910] I was like, okay
[00:39:07.870] So like we don't have to be so stiff and like nervous all the time
[00:39:12.590] That's true
[00:39:13.230] And there's definitely like a little bit of merit that comes with being more casual
[00:39:17.390] Like I feel like it relaxes our guests as well
[00:39:20.670] And makes it a little bit less
[00:39:22.670] Formal. Yeah, but I think like going back to the feeling super tired thing
[00:39:26.910] We also used to do like back-to-back recording sometimes
[00:39:29.950] Oh, true on weeks where we would try to cram stuff and I would
[00:39:34.030] Say that you know with traveling and whatnot now
[00:39:36.430] It's not like we don't do like double episode weekends
[00:39:39.790] But back then we would literally like be to be it like 10 minute break in between
[00:39:44.030] Wait, you're so right
[00:39:46.350] And I'm like, why do we do that?
[00:39:47.950] Now we're good and we'll do like one on Friday one on Saturday
[00:39:51.310] If we need to do like a double episode weekend
[00:39:53.470] But back then we literally raw-dogged it for like four hours at a time
[00:39:57.790] I remember one time we were like, okay lunch break meet back here in like 20 minutes
[00:40:04.190] It was like a work day
[00:40:06.910] I think another pro though speaking of lunch breaks to all this like recording
[00:40:11.630] Is that whenever we do in-person recordings
[00:40:14.670] It's extra nice because you know, not only are we hanging out for the podcast
[00:40:19.070] But we can easily extend that hangout more
[00:40:23.390] So usually if we do an in-person recording with our friends
[00:40:26.350] We try to grab like lunch or dinner after or before
[00:40:30.670] Or you know, just go out grab some tea and like spend some extra time together
[00:40:34.910] I remember our recent recording that we mentioned earlier with brian
[00:40:39.630] That ended up turning into like a whole day hangout because we haven't seen him in a while
[00:40:43.950] And he like only recently moved back to the bay
[00:40:46.590] So we were like, oh well, we might as well just like
[00:40:49.710] You know extend this hangout since we're all here already
[00:40:53.070] And I think those are just like really nice moments that we get to have because of the podcast
[00:41:00.110] I know it's like something so simple, but I feel like it always makes me feel so grateful about how
[00:41:06.110] Much deeper we can make our connections with our friends through the podcast and really it's like an excuse to hang out
[00:41:11.310] Right. Yeah, the recording is one thing, but I think we literally
[00:41:15.150] Got dinner and then like rotted playing 2k on our couch for like four to five hours
[00:41:21.950] And I was like this is just so nice
[00:41:23.710] And there's something very special about having that hangout after a recording with a friend
[00:41:27.950] Especially someone you haven't seen in a long time
[00:41:30.430] Was just so chill so casual and you guys all collectively like accomplish something. So, you know, I definitely relish those moments as well
[00:41:38.270] I think the podcast also loosens us up because you know, we get the conversation flowing
[00:41:43.870] And sometimes we even break into like a bit of a deep talk for the pod
[00:41:47.950] And so, you know getting out of that returning. We're just like, oh, yeah, like we could talk about anything
[00:41:52.910] We can do anything now
[00:41:54.590] We're super comfortable and ready. Oh my god, also
[00:41:58.190] This is something that our listeners would not know but I think anyone who has recorded with us before
[00:42:03.390] Has experienced this but I feel like the tea sesh right after the recording is over is always so juicy
[00:42:10.830] And it's not always something like super deep or anything, right? Like depending on the topic
[00:42:14.110] Whatever the gossip might be might not be as
[00:42:17.470] Major, you know, we always leave like five to ten minutes after the recording is over to talk about things that
[00:42:23.150] We wouldn't want aired on a podcast episode and it's always very interesting. That's true
[00:42:27.710] Sometimes we're like, okay, we're off air now
[00:42:31.230] So what was that story you mentioned earlier on the podcast? Like what was that that you just said? Like we can't just gloss over it
[00:42:38.830] Many redacted details, I would say
[00:42:41.710] Yeah, I think ultimately the podcast has brought a lot of joy for us and
[00:42:47.310] You know, it's kind of crazy really to think about it that it's been five years
[00:42:51.630] And it's also just crazy that we have so many people listening to the podcast
[00:42:56.190] I think every time we get like a thank you message or just someone reaches out to us. We're always super
[00:43:01.950] Grateful, we're not always able to respond right away, but we will get to your message no matter what
[00:43:07.950] So we appreciate that and everyone's patience as well
[00:43:12.030] But yeah, I think it's just kind of crazy reflecting back on the last five years
[00:43:16.910] I know it has been such a dream and
[00:43:20.190] I feel like when I think back to how the idea was even started in the first place like it never felt like
[00:43:25.790] Oh, let's launch this long-term project together
[00:43:29.230] But you know looking back on the journey. That's basically what this has become
[00:43:34.270] So it's just I don't know. It's really crazy honestly
[00:43:37.230] And I think
[00:43:38.430] I would never claim that we are like a perfect podcast or anything at all
[00:43:42.590] But considering how we started this podcast, we have definitely come a long way and you know
[00:43:49.470] More to come on this journey
[00:43:50.990] But thank you everyone including all our friends our family honestly like everyone who supports us and
[00:43:56.910] Our listeners for even just being with us along on this journey
[00:44:00.990] Agreed. Thank you so much for the last five years and we look forward to the
