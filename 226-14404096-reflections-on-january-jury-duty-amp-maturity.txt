[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal All right, so we have a slang word today I don't know if we should still call them Gen Z words because
[00:00:23.270] What is it like Gen Alpha is on the come up for something and some of these words are also started by them But we do have a word today but we also wanted to ask our listeners if you all like the
[00:00:37.230] Slang word of the week since we're in the new year. We're still playing around a bit with our themes and Structures, so if you like it and want us to keep doing it
[00:00:47.870] Let us know we'll put up a poll in Spotify and we'll probably put up a poll on our Instagram as well So the word that Jeesoo actually brought today is Yap slash yapping slash yapper. I
[00:01:02.590] Think that's such a funny word too because as you've said before Jeesoo like this is a real word If you look in the dictionary, this is a legitimate word It's not really slang in its origin But it's been really popular lately
[00:01:18.990] I've been seeing it on tik-tok a lot mostly in the comments, dude Yeah, the comments on tik-tok are so savage sometimes especially when it comes to the usage of this word
[00:01:27.870] Because I feel like they do not hold back and they will make fun of you for yapping. Oh my god So the definition of the word is pretty True to its actual meaning which is talking a lot, but it's definitely a lot more negative of a context
[00:01:44.990] So on know your meme, I thought this about description was so funny It says the concept of yapping or someone yapping Became a tik-tok meme and it's a way to lightheartedly demean someone's opinions or Alternatively highlight a creators tendency to talk too much
[00:02:05.510] I've also seen variations of this as with all slang I guess but sometimes if There's someone on tik-tok and they're doing like a story time video, for example, but it goes on for a really long time They're adding all these unnecessary details
[00:02:19.230] Then the comments will always be like Oh bros a professional yapper or like bros fluent in Japanese Holy shit, dude. We've evolved. I'm just being like this is too wordy. It's like yeah to insult them this way The Japanese is so funny Too good
[00:02:36.750] Yeah, I think it's nice though because the word itself doesn't feel very mean that's true It does kind of maintain that more light-hearted tone I think at least so I feel like when I see it used I can like get on board with it cuz I'm like
[00:02:51.710] Oh, this is kind of funny. It's not too crazy Like no one's getting really hurt and usually people who get called yappers They kind of make fun of themselves to a little bit. They're like, oh, yeah
[00:03:01.670] I know I kind of just like talk about nothing for hours or whatever And I've actually heard this word used in real life as well So some of our friends actually say it the first time I heard it was in the context of someone who got
[00:03:14.230] Pretty drunk one night and then they were talking a lot in the car about like random bullshit Basically, we're like, you know, people are drunk and they're just like saying stuff, but it doesn't make any sense Yeah
[00:03:24.390] But we were just like recounting what we witnessed that night and then my friend was just like oh my god This person would not stop yapping. Oh and I feel like it is kind of insulting
[00:03:34.150] But it just made it so much more funny rather than just feeling. Oh this person like talk too much Yeah and then the other way I've seen it in real life was like if someone just has what is called a bad opinion or
[00:03:45.870] Just an opinion that someone else disagrees with then someone will Usually be like, oh stop yapping or like you're a professional yapper. You know, your opinion is invalid basically
[00:03:56.070] Yeah, I've definitely seen that as well. And I think another funny thing I've seen on tik-tok is I guess I'm on like girlfriend talk I think But basically there's like couples or or like girlfriends or whatever and they're like, yeah, I'm always like yapping away
[00:04:12.430] I'm like boyfriend like making no sense and I feel like that's really funny too. And it's just like making fun of yourself Oh, it's true
[00:04:20.350] Actually, I can kind of relate to that because I think I'm going through something right now where sometimes I feel like I'm saying things Out loud to James, but I'm not actually saying them like I'm just thinking them
[00:04:30.590] So then I was like in this conversation, I guess quote-unquote with James, right? Yeah Oh, and I like went from point A to point C basically and then James wasn't answering So I was like are you gonna answer and then James was like wait
[00:04:44.230] Can I get like some context on what you just said cuz you just dropped some random sentence out of nowhere I was like, oh no, I Was yapping in my head and also externally So
[00:04:57.350] It was like you said point A and then point B was happening in your head and you said point C Yeah, I think it's cuz I was cleaning So I'm like doing stuff and I was like distracted and then I was like wait, is he gonna respond?
[00:05:09.950] I realized I just gave him no context He's just like wait what you said something. Oh my god. That's so funny. You know what? I'm a yapper when I'm drunk as well And I think I'm also a yapper at night sometimes oh, yeah, I feel uh
[00:05:27.110] I'm the kind of girlfriend to bother the shit out of my partner right as they're comfortable and about to fall asleep and like dude like blah blah blah blah and they're like I Guess I'll have to stay away for this conversation
[00:05:41.670] Oh my god, I totally feel that I'm the type of yapper where if I'm like really into something or like I'm going through something Transformative in my life, so I'll talk about this later. But right now I'm in jury duty I'll just like non-stop yap about it
[00:05:55.710] Like people will try to pivot the conversation away to something more like interesting and I'm like we have to go back to me being in jury duty My god, we must discuss this wait I think this is valid though because I think out of all my close friends
[00:06:11.070] You're the only one who I know who is legitimately in jury duty Like everyone usually either doesn't get picked or they have some excuse and they end up not going So, I mean, I'm like keep yapping
[00:06:24.410] Wait, I feel so validated. I've been like literally making people's ears bleed by talking about I'm like, oh my god. What is jury duty? Also because I'm Canadian. So whenever I get jury duty notice or summons, I'm just like oh, I'm not a citizen
[00:06:42.010] They're like, all right, like fuck off Dude, honestly, that's the best excuse and actually I think you're right like I personally don't know a ton of people who have actually served in a jury before and
[00:06:54.490] I was kind of wondering if maybe the county that I live in just has less people compared to where I grew up Where a lot of our like family friends live and whatnot
[00:07:03.370] So that could be a potential reason and I think another reason is also because we're like kind of recently Working adults and like not students. Yeah, especially because a couple of those years were COVID So I'm not actually sure if they were doing jury duty at the time
[00:07:17.470] But this is just such a crazy experience for me that I think it's like overtaking The way that I view life like oh my god I know that's so dramatic, but I was like texting a group chat the other day
[00:07:28.890] I was on my lunch break at jury duty And I was like complaining about how I had no friends at jury duty basically And instead of saying I'm so lonely like no one's talking to me at jury duty
[00:07:41.110] I was like, I don't have any friends at work. So like sucks or something and James was like work No, this is your civil duty this is a work I take it that seriously
[00:07:55.530] Dude, this is why you are selected because they knew they're like dude. This is legitimate work to her Like she is here to learn and vote and deliver Bro, I'm not gonna lie. Okay, I would be lying if I said that I didn't feel immense joy
[00:08:11.490] satisfaction and pride from being selected as a juror I was like This is probably just because I was one of the last names called and they just want to speed up the selection process
[00:08:20.530] But I feel like the chosen one dude. It's like the bachelor you got a rose. Oh my god. Yeah That's so funny cuz normally people are like dude, please don't choose me. Don't you? I think I kind of felt like both emotions
[00:08:36.130] But I truly did feel special when I was selected as one of the jurors Yeah, and I don't know it has been a very interesting experience so far I think you're right
[00:08:47.130] Like a lot of people want to get out of jury duty and honestly for the logistics and convenience of my life right now I think that would have been a better choice as well But a lot of people ask me like oh, why don't you say this?
[00:08:57.650] I heard it helps you get out of jury duty or like oh usually if you talk about this or something, you know They won't want to select you and whatnot. But yeah, I think for me the inconvenience thing was
[00:09:09.210] Not big enough of a factor for me to like want to do those things to get out of it And plus I was just like curious about it Anyway, it's like I watched the show jury duty on Amazon Prime Video and I was like that could be me
[00:09:21.210] or Were you running away from your other responsibilities? Damn Sorry that got too real Okay, but I wasn't like, you know pitching myself to be a juror That's true Cuz I think I remember someone had given a tip like oh
[00:09:38.170] Maybe if you say something along these lines like you won't chosen and you're like, I'm not gonna lie though Yeah, I mean that to me is kind of like I guess you're not sworn in when you're answering these questions To be like a potential juror or whatever
[00:09:51.570] But it's like, you know the thing about like perjury and like oh don't cry in court Like the judge is called like the honorable whatever whatever and I'm just like, okay first of all, that's just like scary to break the rules like
[00:10:03.570] And then I guess the other thing too is like I heard if you are Clearly very opinionated for example or like very traumatized about stuff Then it wouldn't make you like a good fit to be a juror for a lot of cases
[00:10:16.090] So then that's why they would excuse you But I guess I don't feel like I'm super opinionated about like a lot of things like maybe when I was younger But now I feel like I'm just like a very average person
[00:10:28.810] Yeah, like very very average. So then I feel like it's also Maybe one of the reasons why I was selected But yeah That's true because I think sometimes we were like dude just say this like random egregious opinion and you know They'll tell you to leave
[00:10:41.450] Okay, the thing too is this isn't like a one-on-one interview with the judge or like the attorney when they do the selection process There's an audience of 80 to 100 people in front of you. So yeah, so it's like people are like
[00:10:54.690] Oh, you know act like you're crazy or do this It's like can you do that comfortably in front of a hundred people? Like that's tough for even you know Someone who is that opinionated? Yeah. Whoa. Okay. I had no idea
[00:11:07.050] I thought it was just like they put you in a room and I for some reason I always imagine it like those rooms and movies and TV shows where like a detective questions you
[00:11:18.450] They like interrogate you exactly and then they're like, all right, you need to either go home or like get back in line We might pick you. I think the setup too is the interview maybe 15 or 20 people at a time
[00:11:31.730] People interviewing you are like the judge the attorneys on both sides, etc There's like a super scary bailiff staring at you and then in the other seats There's kind of like an audience, but they're really more like other prospective jurors
[00:11:45.530] So they're just waiting to be a part of the like 15 to 20 that get called to get questioned Right, it kind of feels like you're on like a show or something
[00:11:52.410] Maybe because I recently watched jury duty and I feel like because it's such a serious and like high-pressure environment I feel like the opinionated people around me We're trying to like throttle or you know
[00:12:03.490] Be defensive about their opinions and try to minimize them a little bit because it kind of feels like you're on the stand You're being put to trial a little bit. Oh, I could totally see that all these people are judging you
[00:12:16.530] Exactly, and you're like fuck. I can't say the wrong thing. Yeah, I guess they see who crumbles under pressure Mmm, so maybe if you just burst out in tears, they'll be like, all right, like send her out Yeah, but it's actually been a very interesting experience
[00:12:33.730] Honestly, I think one of the hardest things for me is I haven't been exposed to the courtroom environment very much So it's all very new which means the memories are like the rules or like things that I know about it are very limited
[00:12:46.490] So the one thing I'm constantly thinking about when I'm in jury duty is Judge Judy You know with like the angry judge and she's always on everyone Yeah, I'm always like damn
[00:12:59.210] And then the other thing I think about is I don't know if you've ever watched the Amanda show. Yes, Amanda Bynes, right? Yes. Yes, do you know the segment? So she used to do a bunch of skits, but she had one
[00:13:11.330] Particularly that was in a courtroom and she would play the judge Basically, they would have like a fake scenario or something for the courtroom and she would always ask the two attorneys to approach the bench
[00:13:22.130] I think is what it's called and then she would just slam their hands into the drawer or some shit I don't know if you remember that But that was like one of the iconic things from that skit bad the dancing lobsters
[00:13:32.450] So I'm just sitting here in like a very serious trial and I'm like thinking about these two things and I'm like I need to stop Thinking about it Yeah, oh wait, that's so funny. Okay, would you say jury duty? The show is pretty accurate
[00:13:46.810] I think I would have to rewatch it just because when I first watched the show I had no Basis of what it actually should be. So maybe once this whole process is over I'll go and rewatch it again, but it's definitely pretty similar. I would say so far
[00:14:02.090] Okay, good to know after you told me I was like, I should probably watch jury duty. This sounds interesting Maybe I'll get educated Yeah, but honestly my life this year so far after we got back from our travel plans
[00:14:15.530] Has been jury duty as you can clearly tell because I will not stop yapping about it Anyways enough about me. What have you been up to lately crystal? Honestly, I've been up to I guess quarter life crisis in the end and beginning of each year
[00:14:34.810] It's usually kind of like quiet Less busy in terms of work and also social life sometimes because I feel like people tend to be traveling During this time. I just felt very I don't know unmotivated low energy lethargic and I was like damn
[00:14:51.730] What's wrong with me? Is this seasonal depression? Sometimes I'm just like wow, I'm just gonna like lie in bed all day and I guess we kind of talked about this last year a little bit too
[00:15:03.730] But I guess the idea is like a lot of things that we do is stuff that we've been doing you know, there's like not as much new stuff around and So it's really easy to just kind of do nothing and let the days blend together
[00:15:19.770] You like lose sight of everything you're like, oh god, what day is it? What week is it? But then like deep inside you're like I want to do something You know, like I want to get up and and get inspired and like do whatever is fun and whatnot
[00:15:36.090] Wow, sorry. This is like so depressing I think actually I'm sure a lot of people I mean definitely including myself can relate to that though And I wonder if it's also just the contrast like the weather
[00:15:47.810] I know is a big factor for anyone who's not in the Bay Area the weather here has been very very gloomy and like rainy I think more so than prior year January's maybe
[00:15:57.330] But I feel like since the holidays and especially like the last quarter of every year is always so crazy and vibrant and busy It's like the first quarter of the next year always feels so dull. Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting
[00:16:10.970] I I was like wow, am I having a quarter-life crisis? Like I don't know what to do I feel like it's sometimes hard to have the Activation energy get up and do something and I think maybe it's also a suburb thing sort of in
[00:16:26.650] Order for us to go do stuff We kind of have to like get up go to our car and drive like 20 plus minutes to wherever Like even target which isn't even that far is like 20 minutes from me
[00:16:38.410] And then you have to worry about like, oh I have to drive another 20 minutes back home It starts being like oh if there's something that I want to do Is it worth the commute kind of and then there's a lot of cost-benefit analysis
[00:16:53.170] Almost in the suburbs, especially in the Bay because it's so big right, right You're like is it worth it to like go up to whatever city or like go to?
[00:17:01.970] Whatever restaurant drive back and spend an hour or two driving to have like a 30-minute meal or something like that or like have do I like One hour activity that kind of stuff has been on my mind a lot where I'm like, oh, you know
[00:17:16.370] Why is it sometimes hard to do things or why is it easier to do nothing? Oh Dude, actually the way that you kind of framed and describe that makes me wonder So I also live in the suburbs now, but for a very short period of my life
[00:17:32.170] I lived up in San Francisco for a little bit and during those times I lived in apartment buildings, right? And I feel like the interesting thing about our apartment buildings was you could always kind of look into just the way that the layout
[00:17:46.050] Was you could always kind of look into someone else's apartment and I feel like that's like somewhat Common ish in a lot of big like dense cities
[00:17:53.690] It's just like you can walk on whatever Street and sort of look into someone's home if they're like lights are on in the evening I just remember any time, you know, we would finish at work. I would take the bus home in the evening and
[00:18:07.090] On the bus, I'm like riding with a lot of these people and then on the walk to the apartment There's like a bunch of people walking around me. I can look into people's apartments See what they're up to people in restaurants, etc, etc
[00:18:19.090] And I think that was one of the first times where I really felt like oh I wonder if this is why like cities are actually considered communities because in the suburbs I'm not really looking into people's homes. You like rarely see someone outside
[00:18:34.010] You know to be able to look into a restaurant you really have to be like on a busy street or something I feel like you have to be more intentional about it. Whereas in the city people are just around you and it's like normal
[00:18:45.570] I think it's so funny that looking into other people's homes And like their windows you're like, oh my god is this community? You're so right Okay, but it's so accurate though, isn't it it's like a guilty pleasure that everyone does that's true
[00:19:05.170] I mean like in New York literally the High Line is known you walk down the High Line and look into people's windows Oh my god That's so funny though. You're like, oh my god, this is community. I'm like neighbor. I love you
[00:19:19.690] And I'm sure they were also looking through your windows. Oh, yeah, and they're like neighbor. I love you back Holy fuck. So I guess until suburban homes also have you know windows that make it easy access for
[00:19:37.030] Pedestrians walking around I feel like it's just a little bit isolating like you truly don't see anyone unless you Commit to seeing someone that day. Yeah, you're so right. I think suburbs are definitely very
[00:19:49.710] Private, you know people are living in single homes single family homes, you know, our walls are not attached You don't know about your neighbors unless you specifically go out and like, you know, try to meet them, right? Apartments and stuff Dude, you know what?
[00:20:05.990] Your neighbors are up to like you hear shit from this like the ceilings and the floors and the walls Like why is my neighbor moving so much furniture today? Like what's going on in their life? Do I remember at one apartment unit?
[00:20:19.710] I felt like I could describe the exact cleaning schedule of my upstairs. This person vacuums at these times of the day. Yeah. Oh My god one of my neighbors one time I was like for some reason they're like rearranging their fucking furniture every other week or something
[00:20:38.070] Either that or they like deep clean every week It's like there's a lot of more than just footsteps going on up there It's kind of interesting because you know, we're like laughing about it now
[00:20:49.990] But I feel like these are things that I used to find so annoying about apartment life Like I would be like I can't wait until we move out and live in like a single-family home or something because life would be so
[00:21:00.710] Quiet, but it's sort of like be careful what you wish for because it truly becomes very quiet. Yeah, very quiet Yeah, like silent Similar to what you said earlier a lot of suburban streets are very quiet in terms of like the people bustling about
[00:21:16.750] There's not really people bustling about they're like rustling occasionally occasional rustles Right. Okay, you know what's actually crazy one time I was coming home and it's kind of late. It was like 2 a.m
[00:21:31.230] And I just see this old couple jogging in the neighborhood and I was like, whoa, it's fucking 2 a.m Like what are you guys doing? Yeah, and now that I'm thinking about I'm like, whoa Is that they wanted so much peace that they're like fuck it
[00:21:45.550] We're just gonna run in the middle of the night. Fuck the daytime running. There's too many cars. We need it when it's dead silent Dude I'm not gonna lie. I'm just imagining you having witnessed a robbery or something
[00:21:58.310] So I'm literally envisioning a criminal chasing some poor lady. Oh, and it was like, oh my god, like they're jogging She's like screaming for her life. Oh Hopefully that wasn't the case because I saw them again the next week
[00:22:15.510] I was like, wow, this is a thing for them talking. Oh, dude. That's kind of like wild though It really I'm jogging what a guy and they're like, they seemed like maybe 50s Around their 50s. I feel like people in the older generation Like to sleep early
[00:22:34.230] Mmm, kind of kind of their thing right early and like get up early, but I was like, okay 2 a.m Either they slept at like 6 p.m. Or they are not like they haven't slept yet
[00:22:47.310] And either way is like crazy, right is this what happens when you live in the suburbs for too long? Oh my god, maybe they were like, let's shake it up. Let's start sleeping at 6 p.m You think it's also interesting contrast actually living like the suburban
[00:23:05.350] American lifestyle and Contrasting it to the Asian lifestyle Especially in like Japan or Korea, which I went to recently things aren't even that popping until like 12 a.m Or something and people are out until like 5 a.m. But here it's like I feel like after 9 p.m
[00:23:22.350] I like rarely see movement out on the streets on my house. Oh my god Yeah, but I guess I feel like my experiences have been like within cities So then usually because it's so dense in Asia
[00:23:34.310] It's all like apartment buildings and pretty crowded so I I don't have any experience with like suburbs in Asia, have you ever seen? Suburban Asia, I guess when I visit my grandma. It's not necessarily like the Bustling part of Busan. It's kind of like a residential neighborhood
[00:23:54.430] There it definitely is like significantly more quiet than being on the streets of like Hongdae or like Tokyo or something I think there's still a little bit more movement there
[00:24:02.810] Like I wouldn't be super afraid to like walk out to the convenience store by myself at like 10 p.m But here I would probably never do that. Oh my god, that's so true. It's like past 10. It's kind of like oh like
[00:24:15.050] Should we even step foot outside? Yeah, dude when Amazon packages get delivered by 10. I'm like, oh my god Should I even open the door? Should I just get it tomorrow? True like it's on your literal doorstep. It's like
[00:24:30.250] Well, I definitely still feel you on the sluggishness of this time of the year But I do feel like there is always a little bit of an interesting Almost like a collective mindset that I see sometimes. So
[00:24:43.810] Yesterday you and a bunch of our friends were over at our house for a goodbye party for a friend who's moving and I Kind of felt like we had one of the most like wholesome and kind of like sweet nights that we've had in a while
[00:24:59.090] Like I wouldn't say it was like fully wholesome, but I felt like it was kind of a family vibe Oh my god, you know what? I mean? Yes. I totally get what you mean After I got home, I was like wow that felt really
[00:25:13.870] Wholesome. Yeah, and like our activities were relatively wholesome We fit some drinking games in there, but like overall, you know, the vibe was still wholesome, right? No one was trying to haze anyone and like no one nothing got out of hand
[00:25:28.250] We all just like had a really good time together Yeah, you're right. It did feel kind of family. Like it was just like wow, this is so nice These are some of our like longest standing friends at least on my me and James's side
[00:25:43.730] But like you've already been a part of this friend group for a long time as well. So, huh? Yeah, I don't know the vibes are really good yesterday Yeah, and I was actually thinking about it and I think you're totally right in the sense that like
[00:25:58.250] people just have a little bit less crazy social schedules right now and people maybe Are feeling similar emotions to us where it's like, oh, it's like kind of slow Bordering loneliness and like rest I guess so then when you have these gatherings
[00:26:14.370] It just feels a lot more special and intimate and people maybe open up a little bit more. It's like interesting, right? It's like not even to say that we just sat there and talked about like deep things on our mind or anything
[00:26:24.330] But it just felt very intimate still and maybe it's just like our mindset together was somewhat like that. Mm-hmm oh my god, so true at one point because one of our friends brought a Karaoke machine and so we were like, oh my god
[00:26:38.030] Yeah, let's karaoke but then like we couldn't find the right charger for the longest time for like the speaker Now one of our friends was like, alright guys, it's time to sit down and talk about our feelings
[00:26:49.450] And then someone was like, you know, I'm gonna go pick up some cups. I'll be right back We're like, oh god, let's play Rage Cage But I mean honestly like we as this friend group
[00:27:00.450] We've done that a lot of times like, you know, just sat down and talked about feelings But I guess it was we wanted to keep the vibes light-hearted and positive and it just continued throughout the whole night. This is a successful
[00:27:12.930] Evening. I've actually been thinking about this kind of stuff a lot so I feel like one of the reoccurring thoughts that I keep having this year is About acting our age
[00:27:25.370] I know it's like such a weird phrase and I feel like oftentimes it is like a very negative and kind of like Judgmental or like, you know labeling statement of like, oh you better act your age or whatnot
[00:27:36.850] but I guess I've just been feeling like I can sort of see the maturity in us and like, you know the people we love around us and It's one of the years where I feel like I've seen it so much more clearly
[00:27:51.610] Like I see it a lot when people bring up things that are maybe sensitive topics or I see it when people are Sharing stories about tough things that they're going through and talking about how they handled it I'm like wow
[00:28:04.010] I've known you for X number of years and You or me two three years ago even would not have acted this mature or we would not have Reacted this way or we would not have had the capacity to like process these things as well as we are now
[00:28:18.490] Yeah and it's kind of like a privilege I think to be able to see that transitional process in a lot of people because it's not Something to take for granted to like know people for a long period of time
[00:28:29.530] But I just feel like it's so cool to see people blossom this way and it's like we're not even 30 yet So see this so early or like even at this age, I feel like is really interesting Yeah, that makes total sense and I think that people
[00:28:45.570] Will more often than not surprise you with their maturity in general? And I think you're right Especially with longtime friends because you kind of have an image of them especially when it's like
[00:28:58.690] You know all the way back from like elementary school or whatever and then you're like, oh my god Like I totally forgot that you and I have grown up actually like we're so much more mature now Like we have some semblance of what we're doing. Definitely
[00:29:13.510] Maybe one of the times that I've really felt this last year mid-december right before me and James were traveling We did like a hotpot night with everyone and I feel like
[00:29:24.510] Usually these kinds of nights go like a very specific way. There's like a certain pattern to these nights, right? But this night we like had hot pot
[00:29:34.310] We sang karaoke for a little bit and then we kind of like split up so like some people were still karaokeing some people were Continuing to eat hot pot or like going back to like revisit it later and things like that
[00:29:44.910] And I just had this really weird feeling that I could now see us doing This exact same thing like this exact style of night when we were 40 or 50 But the kind of nights that we were having say like two years ago
[00:29:58.910] I feel like there was like an expiration date to these kinds of things Not to say they're like super crazy But you know what? I mean, right just like very late nights and like things that like people in their 20s like to do but this I felt like
[00:30:10.670] Was very much like I have seen my parents do this with their friends when I was like in high school This is something very special, you know Yeah I was just about to say the meme is that you know
[00:30:21.310] The Asian family friend parties is the parents karaoke and the kids are like On their laptop somewhere playing Maple Story or something. I'm like, oh shit. That's like what we're doing now We've literally had dinner and like sang karaoke. I know
[00:30:38.950] Although last night we fit in some drinking games You know, we did a little bit of Rage Cage wait the funniest thing was when we were scheduling everything the day before and you're like Chris are you down to play Rage Cage? And I was like
[00:30:53.670] Yeah, sure, but like not too much rage right like calm cage Do I laugh so hard? It actually was indeed like kind of calm like it was chaotic but in a calm way. Yeah It's hard to describe it was just like really well contained, you know, yeah
[00:31:13.830] People were cheering each other on I think everyone was like excited to play and everyone was down as well Because it was also not scary because it was like, okay We're gonna pour like as little as we can in each of these cups everyone lost gracefully as well
[00:31:30.470] I keep saying this but it was just really good vibes. I Think that's true though. Like we've definitely played Rage Cage a lot even with like this specific group of friends Well, I feel like it's a commonly occurring game
[00:31:43.790] But yesterday it kind of felt like it was fun because of the people we were playing with and not because the game is Itself was like fun. Like sometimes you play it because you're like, oh I'd like to play Rage Cage
[00:31:54.270] But yesterday I feel like it was funny because it was like us that was playing it Yeah, but yeah, I think even just reflecting on the last handful of years
[00:32:03.070] These gatherings just have evolved so much in terms of like the purpose and intent that we bring to these gatherings I guess. Mm-hmm. I feel like there's such a
[00:32:14.110] Want to like catch up and like see how everyone's doing get a little bit more comfortable and cozy with everyone Versus oh, we should hang out kind of thing Not that this friend group was ever like not close
[00:32:25.230] But at least for me I feel like there was some sort of evolution in the last few years you know, I think maybe another thing that contributed to this all like you said the
[00:32:35.830] Gathering was kind of to celebrate and say goodbye to one of our friends who's moving out of state Not that we'll never see her again But it's just like oh, you know, like it's gonna be sad that she's not in the Bay anymore and maybe somewhere
[00:32:51.790] Subconsciously, that's like a reminder of our being adults, you know, like people Move people like come and go but they're still precious friends It was like a celebration of our friendship. And then that's what like kind of contributed to like the mood
[00:33:09.830] Yeah, actually that's a really good point I feel like this friend in particular too is Really really good at gathering people and rallying people to hang out
[00:33:18.230] And she has definitely kind of been like a cornerstone of the friend group in terms of like getting Bay Area people to actually commit To something so her leaving I think is gonna be a huge transition for us as well Probably yeah, and I think you're right
[00:33:33.510] It is interesting to think about it that way because I felt like these things felt so Much more emotional for me when I was younger
[00:33:42.870] This is gonna be a little bit weird to describe because I'm not trying to say that I don't feel sad about this friend moving But I guess I now feel more happy for her that she's moving versus when I was younger
[00:33:56.310] I think I truly felt sad when people moved away You know what? I'm talking about. I think so It was more like oh, I'm gonna be sad that this person's gone
[00:34:05.470] But now I'm like, oh, I'm so excited for this person to go like it's like more of a outward Viewpoint versus like an inward looking viewpoint. I think that's exactly right because even when
[00:34:18.990] we like graduated high school and people kind of dispersed into whatever cities that they were initially going to Or I feel even when you had moved to New York for a little bit I feel like the primary emotion that I felt when someone was moving was like
[00:34:31.150] Oh, this is like a devastating loss to me And I know that sounds so selfish But I think I just maybe was more selfish back in the day and that's probably also when our lives weren't fully like cemented or maybe we just our
[00:34:43.950] Senses of self weren't as strong yet. So then it truly kind of was like oh my life and my identity are Like an average of these ten people that I'm closest to or whatever Yeah
[00:34:55.470] but now it's like, you know, we each kind of have our own like bubbles and pods of like our own lives and we just Have the privilege to like hang out with each other when we can
[00:35:05.990] so then when you know close friends move away, like it's still sad and it still is like sort of a Loss or like maybe a void in your daily routine or whatever
[00:35:16.790] But at the end of the day, it's like I just feel more happy for that person than I am sad. Oh Wow character development. Wait. Yeah, I think also maybe what helps is now that we're a little more
[00:35:31.590] Established it's clearer to us like oh, hey if I plan well and like, you know save up some money I can go travel to this place and hang out with them and they can do the same like they'll probably come back for the
[00:35:45.590] Holidays to hang out with family anyway, and then like it's like a now that we've experienced these things more It's like oh, I know what to expect now and I know how to navigate these Situations better than when it first was happening, dude
[00:36:01.870] Actually, you're so right because now that I think about it I distinctly have a memory of in 2019. One of our friends had moved up to San Francisco and Even that I was like, oh my god, like we're never gonna see her again
[00:36:15.290] Like we're not gonna be able to hang out with her that much like this really sucks Well, and we were just in like South Bay and Fremont, which I feel like it's not even that far
[00:36:25.110] Like yeah, it is not but even that I was like, oh my god. This is such a loss. I Think you're right now. It's like I know that even if someone lived right next door
[00:36:36.030] It's like still sometimes hard to like find the time to hang out with people. So it's not always about distance I feel like it really is about I don't know what it's about, but it's just hard Dude life is hard I'm with you on that
[00:36:53.550] So, I guess one last thought for me in terms of like the I guess intrusive thought of like acting Yeah is as much as I do feel like there's a positive aspect to it where I Like thinking about it because I'm like wow
[00:37:08.950] we are kind of acting like we are in our late 20s the weird aspect of that a little bit is I kind of find myself trying to define what it Means or looks like to act like we're 27 28. Yeah, and I
[00:37:24.710] Feel like I'm starting to kind of form an opinion about what I feel like 28 is supposed to be like. Oh And I don't know if this is like the start of me Becoming like a grandma shaking my cane on my porch being like these damn kids or whatever
[00:37:40.110] but I guess just because I am thinking about the growth of the people around us and Myself and James, of course it just sometimes highlights things that I
[00:37:51.750] See people doing when I'm like, oh this is kind of like early 20s or like maybe closer to mid 20s behavior Yeah, that makes sense because it's like us as a collective is kind of character developing together
[00:38:04.470] Right, but if someone is like maybe falling behind because of you know circumstances or whatever it becomes a little more noticeable I think also Sometimes seeing young people like having so much energy and like doing all these things. I'm like, whoa. Are you guys not tired?
[00:38:21.430] Dude that's so true actually I guess like one of the easy examples to me I feel like I used to be quite vain not in the sense of oh I thought I was the best-looking person in the world
[00:38:32.350] But it's just like appearance and like these kinds of things Were 50% of what I was thinking about all the time like I feel like it mattered to me significantly more back then So then now when I see tendencies like that in people
[00:38:43.590] I'm just like oh shit that totally reminds me of me like a couple years ago I guess it's like our parents when they're always like oh like looks fade You know
[00:38:52.750] Don't just go after looks or whatever you know in the dating pool like the younger you are the more you're like no I want like a beautiful friend or whatever Yeah, we're becoming our parents. I know Yeah, I guess I just feel like
[00:39:07.070] Because I am thinking about like we're so much more mature now because we do this It's not saying that you know We're like the most mature people ever but it's like there's specific factors and things that I can point to where I'm like
[00:39:17.390] Oh, I'm more mature now because I used to do whatever whatever or like, you know, things like that I feel like it goes the opposite way as well Certain things stand out to me because it is something that I would kind of consider
[00:39:29.030] Immature because it's sort of like the opposite of what I would consider it mature or it's like something you used to do that You've like learned from so you're like, oh this action shows that someone hasn't learned from it quite yet
[00:39:41.070] Right, and I feel like the reason why it's it feels more new to me too is I feel like when you're younger It's kind of more about personality differences So I would attribute something to someone's personality versus like their maturity like I feel like it's more about
[00:39:57.070] And now it's like especially as you kind of move through life and it's many stages with different people You see like the average growth rate To make this like a whole fucking thesis But it's just like you can kind of tell when it's not about personality anymore
[00:40:16.750] And it kind of is about whether you've matured or not So I know it's a little bit of a weird thing to say but I feel like it's a lot more about personality
[00:40:25.630] So I know it's a little vague but I think just the fact that I'm thinking about concepts like maturity I'm like this makes me feel like I'm a billion years old like truly giving my cane right now
[00:40:38.110] Yeah, but you know, that's just a maybe it's a late 20s thing. You just think about these things We were more experienced now and I think like things are finally like some things that you know Maybe your parents said 10 15 years ago and you're like, oh shit
[00:40:54.030] I guess they were kind of right. We'd like see more perspective because of living through More stuff now I think that's exactly right and I kind of wonder maybe life is sort of about like the bulking and cutting process
[00:41:08.070] Like, you know how bodybuilders are like people who lift a lot They'll like sometimes go through periods of like huge growth and you know Like gaining mass or whatever so they'll like eat a fuck ton work out a lot and then they go through the cutting process
[00:41:21.470] You know, you get more lean you like diet really hard calorie restrict, etc I feel like in some ways there are some times or certain years in my life where I've grown a lot and by growth
[00:41:32.510] not just like real growth, but I mean like expanded my worldview and like Opened up a lot to a lot of new things and then there were years in my life where I felt like I really streamlined things that I enjoyed things I wanted to do and
[00:41:46.190] Really prioritize and like focus on cutting down on things that truly matter to me So I feel like there is kind of like that up and down in terms of like my past years So I wonder what kind of year this will be. Whoa
[00:42:00.070] What was last year then? That's a good question, I think last year for me maybe was bulking Mmm, I can totally say that. I think I was maybe about bulking as well I felt like I did a lot of new things even despite like wedding planning and stuff
[00:42:19.470] But I don't know. I'm kind of getting like cutting season vibes Maybe cuz like if we did a lot last year then now it's like, okay Let's you know bring our focus back in on right like what we want to do this year and stuff
[00:42:34.510] well always fun to yap about our random deep thoughts and crises I Feel like half of it is yapping. We're just like saying the same thing to each other and we're like, yeah, totally Like in there, there's some treasure. We're like, oh my god
