[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Tiffany.
[00:00:15.860] Welcome back, Tiffy. It's been a while. Last time Tiffy was on the podcast with us
[00:00:21.300] was episode number 176, the K-pop concert experience, which is a good listen. And also
[00:00:28.660] I'm glad we recorded that because all three of us are actually going to go to a K-pop
[00:00:33.860] concert together soon, which is pretty exciting. We brought Tiffy on again today because we thought
[00:00:40.020] she would be the perfect guest to talk about going through tough times, how we like to personally
[00:00:45.220] handle it and also how to support friends who are going through tough times as well.
[00:00:49.380] Tiffy is someone who I consider a very good role model as like an archetype of good friend.
[00:00:55.780] So I'm excited to talk through going through tough times with her today.
[00:00:59.060] So let's kick this off by talking about our personal experiences. Do you guys ever go through
[00:01:05.140] times in life that feel particularly tough and what do you personally like to do to feel better
[00:01:10.420] or get through these times? Well, I think it's a given that we probably all go through some tough
[00:01:18.900] times, but I think for me if it's kind of a big emotional event, then I tend to retreat a bit
[00:01:26.660] and spend time processing it by myself for a bit before I start reaching out to other people such
[00:01:35.140] as friends or family. I do the same actually. If I'm going through something tough, I'll typically
[00:01:41.300] like process it by myself first or spiral by myself first and try to really like come to terms with
[00:01:47.380] the situation and what's going on before I reach out. A lot of times I won't even reach out because
[00:01:52.100] I'll come to a conclusion by myself after a couple of days thinking about it or I'll reach
[00:01:57.220] out to my partner who's always there. It is easy to just start the conversation with them or bring up concern.
[00:02:03.860] I think that's very relatable. There's a lot of vulnerability that comes with being able to even
[00:02:10.020] talk about whatever you're going through with other people. I feel like there's a variety of
[00:02:14.580] different reasons that cause us to isolate too, right? Whether maybe we don't want to burden other
[00:02:19.460] people or it might sometimes feel uncomfortable just talking about it at all. But I think for me,
[00:02:26.340] if I look back on my past behavior, I've kind of changed over the years. Before I started living
[00:02:33.060] with James, I would say I was the type of person to talk about my issues a lot with friends and I
[00:02:39.940] would seek constant advice about it. Maybe not even advice but I would just like enjoy talking about
[00:02:45.700] what I was going through and saw it as almost like a currency or like token of friendship.
[00:02:50.900] But I think now that I've started to live with James and have been doing so for the last couple
[00:02:55.380] of years, I've noticed that I don't actually do that as much anymore. And when I'm going through
[00:03:00.020] something, I really just process it mainly with James who is my partner. Do you feel like you miss
[00:03:07.060] the support from friendship? Just because I'm imagining that if you process a lot of this stuff
[00:03:13.460] with just James, then sometimes you're limited to just your two perspectives. I think I do but
[00:03:20.820] it's also a little bit different. So I guess the easiest way to put it is when I was younger,
[00:03:28.100] especially in high school and college, I feel like my tough times were really about the guy that I
[00:03:34.100] was seeing or like crushing after or you know some sort of like drama that I feel like is a
[00:03:38.740] little bit more fun to talk about and discuss with your friends. But now that we're in our late 20s,
[00:03:44.180] I'm married now. I feel like the tough times that I go through now are significantly less fun to talk
[00:03:50.180] about. So it's like oh I feel stressed out about work or maybe I miss my family who live far or you
[00:03:56.660] know I have concerns about x y and z which are like natural parts of being your late 20s. Like I feel
[00:04:02.420] like these things aren't as fun. So like before maybe my problems were things that I was like oh
[00:04:07.300] this might be kind of entertaining for my friends like time to go spill the tea or like talk about
[00:04:12.420] my guy problems and maybe it'll be funny. But now I'm like damn do I really want to trauma dump on
[00:04:17.460] my friends about how certain things in my life have been really tough? So I think it's just
[00:04:23.220] that also has to do with why I share a little bit less now. I think that makes a lot of sense. Like
[00:04:28.580] when you say trauma dumping on your friends, I feel like also now we're a little more self-aware
[00:04:33.620] in the state we are in life about expressing ourselves or putting a lot of burden on a friend
[00:04:38.100] when you have to like talk about something because you might put them in a difficult situation where
[00:04:41.780] it's uncomfortable for them or they feel stressed for you because you're so stressed about the
[00:04:46.340] situation. And it's like a lot of emotions to put on someone. So we're more like conscientious
[00:04:52.100] about what we say to people I feel like. So it makes it easier to just spill the tea to like
[00:04:58.020] your partner that you already live with because you don't have to give context when you talk about
[00:05:01.620] things, right? Yeah that's a good point. I feel like sometimes sharing an emotional story or even
[00:05:10.180] just a story in general suddenly turns into this giant like super long story time with friends
[00:05:16.500] where as you said you have to give the background context like why certain things are important,
[00:05:22.180] certain details are important in the story. But if you have like a partner who's there all the time
[00:05:28.020] then they have been building up this background knowledge of context already. So it's easier to
[00:05:33.140] just like oh my god this happened and they already know everything all the history and
[00:05:37.700] everything behind it. So Crystal me and Jisoo both live with our partners how is it like for you
[00:05:43.140] in a relationship but you don't actually live with your partner so you don't see them every single
[00:05:47.060] day? I think with a partner who doesn't live with me I definitely don't have his time as readily
[00:05:54.020] available as you two might be able to have with your partners and I think because of that for sure
[00:06:00.660] there's some context building that he doesn't get to see or hear about since we're not together like
[00:06:08.660] all the time. But I do think over time as the relationship grows and gets longer there's
[00:06:14.660] definitely more of that he gets to hear much more detail about my life than probably the average
[00:06:21.940] friend right? Just any minor conveniences or even notable inconveniences he'd probably be the first
[00:06:29.540] person to hear about it so I think it's like still in that process of building up the context and the
[00:06:34.820] history but I don't know. I don't know what it's like to have a partner who lives with you and like
[00:06:39.940] have them know so much about you literally like your day-to-day schedule and like everything
[00:06:45.140] so detailed. I think actually what you said about not having his time readily available makes a lot
[00:06:50.980] of sense and that kind of connects to maybe why we share less of what we're going through with our
[00:06:56.500] friends nowadays. It's like you only have a very fixed amount of time in your week to like talk
[00:07:02.260] to friends or hang out with them and a lot of your energy is being sucked into like maybe work or
[00:07:06.900] like the day-to-day life so then how much of that time that I have with my friends do I want to spend
[00:07:12.500] talking about certain things? I will say the positive side about being able to share these
[00:07:17.380] things with my partner is you know sometimes these tough times are like just a one-day thing right?
[00:07:22.500] It's like oh I had a rough day today that really sucked this thing happened I'm not feeling good
[00:07:26.500] but I think there are other times where the tough times are like longer so when I'm going through
[00:07:32.660] like a period of time where for a couple of weeks I just feel really down. I don't want to talk to
[00:07:37.060] people. I don't want to engage in anything. I'm having maybe like a mini depressive episode or
[00:07:42.340] something. I feel like it's nice to have someone consistently there to be able to support passively
[00:07:48.100] without me having to be like messaging someone like hey I feel down today like next day hey I
[00:07:53.220] feel down today etc etc like it's a little bit less high maintenance feeling as well.
[00:07:58.580] I think that makes a lot of sense. Another thought that just occurred to me is that if I'm actively
[00:08:04.260] kind of like you're saying actively in a I don't know emotional episode or something because I
[00:08:09.300] don't live with my partner that means I have to as you mentioned like kind of stop in my day and
[00:08:14.740] like reach out to them. I have to stop everything text and be like oh my god like this just happened
[00:08:20.180] I'm so like annoyed or this is like really whatever versus I'm imagining if you just live
[00:08:26.260] with them then you're going through this trouble and they're just there and you're like dude this
[00:08:30.660] is so annoying like I can't believe this is happening right yeah and I feel like sometimes
[00:08:35.300] when you live with them you talk about your day and everything it's as if they're going through
[00:08:39.780] the experience with you in a sense but that takes us to another point where like we shouldn't over
[00:08:46.100] burden our partner sometimes where instead of like trauma dumping as we like to call it on our
[00:08:51.940] friends you do that to someone who's easier more convenient like our partners so that's something
[00:08:58.420] I actively try to think about. Yeah definitely a good point whenever there's like gaps in my
[00:09:04.820] schedule where I'm unable to fit in therapy for a while I notice the like trauma dumping on James
[00:09:10.260] gets significantly worse and I'm always like maybe I should stop and book a therapy session
[00:09:17.780] yeah that's true I think like therapy is a good tool here where you're able to bounce ideas off
[00:09:24.660] of someone or just like thoughts and they can help you process. For me I think it helps to vocalize
[00:09:30.820] my thoughts sometimes even if my therapist is just like cool like sounds great good thoughts
[00:09:37.460] but it's just like you say it out loud and then you hear yourself saying it sometimes
[00:09:41.780] or they're there to like validate you and be like yeah I can see why you're feeling that way
[00:09:47.220] and I think that relieves a lot of maybe like personal guilt or stress or any of those feelings
[00:09:55.540] attached to the worry of like oversharing with friends. Yeah definitely just having someone
[00:10:02.100] validate your feelings that you feel sad or you feel upset about certain situation or circumstance
[00:10:08.980] makes you feel like you're being supported even if they have nothing no like suggestions or opinion
[00:10:14.820] solutions to solve your problem when someone says like oh yeah you can totally feel that way or I
[00:10:19.860] hear you that's very upsetting I would feel just as upset as you are it just feels good for someone
[00:10:25.780] to like verbally validate you you're not doubting yourself or feeling this way. I completely agree
[00:10:32.980] and I think you can kind of feel that self-doubt leak into like storytelling sometimes too right
[00:10:38.340] oftentimes when I experience something and I'm like dude I can't believe that just happened to
[00:10:42.180] me like what the f**k and I go to tell my friend about it I find myself using like weird language
[00:10:48.020] that kind of shields me from like oh you know maybe I'm crazy but blah blah blah like is that weird
[00:10:53.540] you know like constantly trying to seek that validation which is why I think when you're
[00:10:58.740] getting it from a friend it just feels so good because then you're really able to unleash these
[00:11:03.460] emotions and these feelings that maybe you are kind of trying to evaluate were like normal or not
[00:11:08.900] so I think it's so valuable to be able to sit down with a friend and like talk to them without
[00:11:15.220] having to do all these weird negative self caveats. Dude that's why I really like the kind
[00:11:20.980] of silly phrasing of being like oh just me or x whatever and then you know sometimes people are
[00:11:29.300] like oh I totally feel you but then sometimes it's just silent but then it gets a good laugh out of
[00:11:34.180] everyone and it turns what could have been a minor inconvenience into more of a light-hearted joke
[00:11:41.380] Agreed and I also try to be mindful of when a friend uses language like that so like
[00:11:48.100] Crystal your example is like a little bit more light-hearted but I think sometimes when friends
[00:11:52.020] talk about stories they're going through they like seriously are like questioning themselves right
[00:11:55.860] so that when I identify language like that I try to be even more validating like no you're like
[00:12:02.980] completely right like you're completely valid even if it feels over the top sometimes I feel
[00:12:08.420] like it's necessary. What if you were in a situation where you actually feel like your
[00:12:13.780] friend is not completely right like they're going through a situation they're having a tough time
[00:12:18.180] and what they're telling you is a little questionable and you don't agree to them
[00:12:21.620] how would you support them though as a friend? Ooh that's tough I think in the moment like if
[00:12:28.260] they're high emotions and you can tell I will try to agree in the best way possible without
[00:12:36.500] lying so maybe if they said something questionable I'll just kind of like brush over that part
[00:12:42.100] and be like that's like what I can think of off the top of my head. I think I would do the same
[00:12:48.340] thing actually you would just try to brush off some questionable words that they're saying pretend
[00:12:52.420] you like you didn't hear it but you validate that they're not feeling good about the situation
[00:12:56.500] they're in you let them know that you're listening and then you kind of just don't offer too much
[00:13:02.660] advice because you disagree with them then what advice are you going to offer them? Yeah that's
[00:13:07.540] fair. Dude this is such a funny question though because this is very tough right it's like I don't
[00:13:13.220] want to validate certain things but I also want my friend to feel supported and I feel like when it's
[00:13:19.380] like a live conversation whether you're face-to-face or like typing on messenger on the fly it's very
[00:13:24.660] hard to like find the perfect thing to say without letting the conversation die out you know like in
[00:13:30.340] person you don't want to just like sit there in silence and like nod forever you have to eventually
[00:13:34.500] say something so I find myself really struggling with this one. Maybe a good option is if it's not
[00:13:42.020] like super serious if they say something kind of unhinged you'd be like okay wait let's not do that
[00:13:48.100] and then like try to redirect the conversation I feel like usually you know the tone of voice you
[00:13:53.700] use while still you know showing that you've been supportive and going to continue to be supportive
[00:13:59.060] that will kind of give a like comedic break in the midst of the conversation but I feel like that's
[00:14:05.140] definitely like a read the room kind of situation can you crack that joke there or can do you just
[00:14:10.980] have to like let it go? Yeah I mean there's definitely no right or wrong answer it's just
[00:14:16.500] like I think it also depends on the person you're talking to and how they react to you disagreeing
[00:14:22.660] with them but still trying to be supportive as a friend or it's the person who just needs you to
[00:14:30.180] just listen and not provide any type of like verbal support but just like your presence then you can
[00:14:36.340] just be silent and not agree not have to agree with anything you disagree with but show them that
[00:14:42.580] you're still there and listening to them and yeah finding them comfort through the time right
[00:14:46.660] just depends on the person I feel like ultimately. Yeah I think that's pretty accurate yeah and I think
[00:14:51.940] even when I think back on times that I've gone through and say I'm in some sort of crazy situation
[00:14:57.700] I have like this hot take that's mostly a bad take I've had friends just like sit there nod and be
[00:15:02.980] like yeah like you know and give like very general responses without necessarily validating what I'm
[00:15:08.740] saying and I've also had friends say I don't know about that one like this one is a little bit weird
[00:15:15.140] but I totally hear you on this other stuff and I think the way I received that kind of response
[00:15:20.580] depended on my attitude at the time too like sometimes I'm more open to hearing someone disagree
[00:15:25.220] with my takes but other times I might not be ready to hear that so I think it is totally a case by
[00:15:30.980] case situation. Maybe another deflection you could say is we should think more on that or you know
[00:15:37.380] something generic that's like not necessarily an agreement or disagreement but like at least
[00:15:44.180] you're responding to them I guess. I feel like that can lead sort of like patronizing a little bit
[00:15:49.700] right it's like so hard to toe the balance because I think you can do it a funny way
[00:15:53.700] then you can do it a serious way and then in between there's just like so many different
[00:15:57.700] responses you can use it's really hard. Agree to disagree that response is a little weird
[00:16:05.220] Dude I feel like agree to disagree is it's valid right like the phrase itself is so valid but I'm
[00:16:12.580] like when is it ever appropriate to like use that phrase? Like how I just did it
[00:16:21.140] Wait you know what I find hella funny is like maybe this is a more common occurrence in like
[00:16:25.780] group chats but when someone says something questionable amidst like a totally valid rant
[00:16:30.100] and everyone like question mark reacts or like emoji reacts like the red question mark is just
[00:16:37.060] so funny oh my god yeah that's a good one I think also like oh wait what?
[00:16:42.340] What did you just say? We're just gonna gloss over that? Yeah the worst is when you say something
[00:16:48.740] and everyone thinks it's a hot take but no one reacts no response then you don't feel
[00:16:53.300] that support that you're searching for speaking from personal experience
[00:16:58.420] I think also if you're close enough friends it's maybe more often that you're able to
[00:17:06.260] disagree a little or at least like call out hey that was a little weird that you just said that
[00:17:12.340] but of course like if it's someone who is a little less close to you then it's harder to like
[00:17:17.700] directly call out these things even if it's like in a funny way this actually kind of reminds me
[00:17:23.060] of something that my mom has always told me my whole life sometimes your friend is going through
[00:17:28.660] something and then they have like a hot take but other times they're going through something and
[00:17:32.340] then maybe their attitude towards life is a little angry or they're being more snippy than usual or
[00:17:38.340] they're kind of essentially lashing out at others because of what circumstances they're going through
[00:17:43.700] and my mom has always said something like you know if your friend is suddenly acting like
[00:17:49.140] a little weird or maybe they're more emotional than usual or something in their attitude or
[00:17:54.980] atmosphere is changing usually it's because they're going through something so just give them
[00:18:00.580] grace and like give them patience and just try to understand your friend as they go through this
[00:18:05.380] like even if they're not explicitly coming to you and being like hey I have this problem
[00:18:09.300] I feel like that's so something you learn with experience you know like it's not an attitude
[00:18:14.180] I could have imagined having in like my teenage years or something like that but I think it is
[00:18:18.580] very true oftentimes people have hot takes because maybe they're feeling emotional or like
[00:18:23.060] they're feeling really upset so I think recognizing that too is a part of being
[00:18:27.620] like a good and supportive friend wise words from your mom but I feel like that brings me to another
[00:18:35.460] question which is if you can kind of tell that your friend is maybe going through something or
[00:18:41.220] acting up a bit recently would you reach out to them and ask if they're doing okay for me it
[00:18:48.020] depends on who the friend is because for example some people like me for instance sometimes I'm
[00:18:54.100] acting a little weird or I'm like going through something it's pretty obvious I'm like not in the
[00:18:58.340] mood I don't prefer it when people reach out in the really beginning unless I've processed it myself
[00:19:04.420] like I mentioned earlier and like kind of like understood the situation and what my next steps are
[00:19:10.660] so if they'll reach out to me sometimes I just like won't respond because I don't really want
[00:19:14.660] to talk about it or I have nothing to say about it or I just don't need that comfort that my friend
[00:19:21.300] is offering so I think it depends on who or if it's like a friend I know that like when they're
[00:19:27.140] going through things they like love the friendship they love like having a person there supporting
[00:19:31.460] them actively then obviously if I sent something off I would reach out to them yeah I feel like
[00:19:38.180] that approach makes a lot of sense like curating it to who your friend is but I find it really hard
[00:19:43.460] to sometimes figure out like exactly what they want because even if it's the same person depending on
[00:19:48.660] the time they might want something different but I think I tread a little bit more cautiously about
[00:19:53.780] reaching out and asking people if they're like going through it you know because I have done that
[00:20:00.260] more often in the past and I feel like it's a really sensitive like thing to do I don't feel
[00:20:06.740] like I'm savvy enough to like navigate it properly so I feel like what I find works the best is to like
[00:20:13.140] be supportive in a different way so maybe like help them feel distracted and help them feel
[00:20:17.220] comfortable and like take them out to do things that I know they like and then maybe towards the
[00:20:21.140] end of the day they'll feel more comfortable sharing I think I'm similar to you both where I
[00:20:26.820] also err on the side of caution and probably not reach out just in case you know they're not the
[00:20:32.980] type of person to want to be reached out to yeah I guess like kind of what you were saying earlier
[00:20:38.980] that nowadays a lot of our problems and issues have evolved they're not as simple as you know
[00:20:45.700] boy troubles back in the day so yeah sometimes like things that people are going through are
[00:20:51.380] really sensitive so it feels almost intrusive to prod a bit to be the person to reach out before
[00:20:57.780] they've shown that they're ready to be reached out to if that makes sense but yeah I think it
[00:21:04.100] can definitely be case by case as well though like if you have a close friend that you're super
[00:21:09.700] comfortable with and like you really know their habits and like the kind of way that they act
[00:21:14.900] then maybe reaching out to them is the move if you know that it won't offend them or like
[00:21:20.500] set them off or anything of that sort and I think you can also do it in like a specific way too
[00:21:26.580] I think reaching out and checking in on your friend is like a natural thing to want to do
[00:21:30.180] but if your friend is not necessarily ready to open up and they give you like a very generic
[00:21:34.740] answer like I'm doing fine like why do you ask then I think as a good friend you also can't be like
[00:21:40.500] offended or feel put off by that too like you have to accept that maybe they're not ready to share
[00:21:44.820] maybe like a good alternative is you could just ask them like hey you want to catch up over like
[00:21:50.500] boba or like quick lunch or something maybe during that like face-to-face conversation
[00:21:56.900] they might start to feel more comfortable and like share with you if they're going through something
[00:22:01.780] I think even like if you hit them up for example you reach out but they're like oh no I'm fine
[00:22:07.300] even a oh I'm here if you want to talk or do you want to talk about it if not that's totally okay
[00:22:12.020] it's like as easy as they can get when you reach out to someone but you're also respecting their
[00:22:15.860] privacy and their own situations or whatever is going on kind of giving them the initiative
[00:22:23.220] to decide whether they want to open up or let you know that they're going through something but
[00:22:28.420] they don't really want to talk about it now and I'm just kind of thinking about like how I myself
[00:22:33.140] operate when I'm going through something or whatever as I kind of mentioned earlier when
[00:22:39.300] I'm ready I do reach out to friends sometimes and what I think is also interesting is I'll
[00:22:45.780] sometimes try to reach out to friends who I know have gone through something similar because then
[00:22:51.380] I feel like if I'm looking for advice in particular they could potentially provide good advice
[00:22:58.980] otherwise I might just reach out to a friend to like have them listen and be like a comforting
[00:23:05.860] support yeah actually thinking about it I do that same thing sometimes if you know a friend has like
[00:23:11.860] gone through the same situation it's easier to like reach out to them and talk to them about it
[00:23:17.540] versus like maybe the person you typically would go to because they might have solutions that maybe
[00:23:22.900] fit your situation well or just like things that like trial and error what they've done that didn't
[00:23:29.220] work out so you kind of know like how to go forth yourself and it just feels a little more comforting
[00:23:34.020] to know that someone has been in the same situation as you and you're not the only one who has to go
[00:23:37.460] through like this tough time by yourself right and plus like it really depends on what is causing
[00:23:44.020] the tough time but I feel like there are times where I'm like this problem that I'm dealing with
[00:23:48.580] feels like slightly humiliating or like slightly embarrassing that I'm going through it and it
[00:23:53.140] might feel more like dirty laundry kind of an area of problem and I think that is probably another
[00:24:01.700] thing that I would feel more sensitive about sharing like I might not go to everyone who I
[00:24:05.540] usually go to and I'll want to keep it a little bit more private and contained for sure I also
[00:24:11.220] actually thought of another thing on the topic of like reaching out to particular friends
[00:24:15.700] I feel like Tiffy is actually a great example because I remember vaguely when post-college
[00:24:22.420] Tiffy is like in nursing right but in our main friend group no one else is a nurse but Jisoo you
[00:24:29.540] have like a couple nursing friends who you ended up referring Tiffy to and then they like chatted
[00:24:35.460] about job searching and I think you guys ended up bonding a lot through that right Tiffy?
[00:24:40.660] Yeah actually yeah me and one of Jisoo's friend actually appeared on another podcast a while back
[00:24:46.740] ago but I connected with that friend through Jisoo because I was probably ranting to Jisoo about like
[00:24:51.940] having a hard time after college job applications and how tough the industry was and she like
[00:24:57.700] connected me to her friend who went through the same situation as me applying to like jobs in the
[00:25:02.340] same area same hospitals and yeah it really helped me out a lot I did feel very supported at the time
[00:25:09.060] yeah perfect example Crystal yeah so I feel like that's definitely another good like option to have
[00:25:15.700] if you have someone to connect a friend to and like help them through certain issues that you
[00:25:21.860] know like you yourself are not totally equipped to help only of course if that other friend is like
[00:25:27.140] looking for that kind of help yeah I feel like that's always kind of like the instinct too of
[00:25:33.380] like how do I support this friend who is coming to me who is going through something but it's
[00:25:38.420] also something that I find as such a double-edged sword because my go-to is always like oh how do I
[00:25:45.060] shower this friend with like advice and like set them up for success but sometimes they don't come
[00:25:49.860] to you necessarily seeking that so how do you guys navigate avoiding saying certain taboos while still
[00:25:55.620] helping your friend feel supported in the best way possible yeah this is actually something I still
[00:26:00.660] struggle with and I'm trying to get better every day but in the past I used to always tell my
[00:26:05.700] friends like oh don't worry oh don't worry about it oh don't worry it's fine because it's just like
[00:26:10.900] first natural instinct for me to just try to make them feel better when they're upset so I just say
[00:26:17.780] don't worry without really thinking but I've gotten feedback from a friend before in the past
[00:26:22.340] where she mentioned that like it really didn't feel encouraging at all when I said that and it
[00:26:27.620] felt like I was just saying it to say it and I didn't realize I had come off in that that way
[00:26:33.300] and like the number of times I might have come off like that way to other people by doing the
[00:26:37.060] same thing so that's something I actively try to avoid saying it's like the phrase like oh don't
[00:26:42.180] worry or it's okay just like very general things that you naturally say without thinking I try to
[00:26:48.180] put more thought into it before saying that and sometimes I'll like catch myself almost saying
[00:26:52.420] it and I'll kind of shut up real fast yeah kind of on a similar vein I think I tend to say stuff
[00:26:59.460] like oh at least this didn't happen or at least you know you still have this you know along those
[00:27:05.460] kinds of lines and when you really think about it it's like is this really helping the situation
[00:27:10.660] like it doesn't mean that the situation didn't happen even though it's like try to look on the
[00:27:15.060] bright side what we're dealing with in the moment is like someone's feelings so that has definitely
[00:27:21.060] been a phrase that I try to avoid but I mean same thing it's like it's so hard and I'm also actively
[00:27:28.900] working on it you just instinctively want to say all these things dude I totally relate to both of
[00:27:34.340] you I think it's because like at least when we were growing up the idea of like comforting a friend
[00:27:39.140] was very much centered around like cheering them up I don't want my friend to be sad so how do I
[00:27:43.780] make them feel happy again but I feel like at least nowadays we know the importance of like
[00:27:49.300] helping friends feel validated and supported and like heard so then I think it makes sense that
[00:27:54.740] we're like trying to unlearn the stuff from our childhood maybe but for me I think I'm cursed with
[00:28:01.940] two different maybe curses so the first maybe curse is the maybe you should or like maybe you
[00:28:07.860] should do this always trying to suggest something which the intention is good right it's like trying
[00:28:14.020] to help out in a way that I know of but I feel like for a lot of people that's like the last
[00:28:19.300] thing that they want to hear and then my other maybe curse is maybe it's because and then I like
[00:28:25.540] go into the psychoanalysis which I feel like is also destructive because sometimes it can be like
[00:28:31.220] fun but for someone who's actively going through it I feel like the last thing you want to do is
[00:28:36.900] add even more avenues of overthinking to their plate so recently I was like I should probably
[00:28:43.780] stop it like this is not productive for them or for me yeah those are good ones and I definitely
[00:28:49.620] struggle with the like maybe you should do this do that thing for sure one thing that kind of helped
[00:28:55.300] me with that particular one is I tried to reflect on like what I would prefer in terms of supporting
[00:29:04.180] behavior and since I'm the type to kind of think through things first and like process stuff
[00:29:10.580] honestly once I reach out to friends I've probably thought out most of these you know
[00:29:15.540] potential avenues so when someone says that to me like oh maybe you should try this maybe you should
[00:29:20.420] do that in my mind I'm kind of like okay but I already thought about that so like I appreciate
[00:29:26.020] the like effort here but like I've already thought about that and that's not what I'm looking for
[00:29:30.260] right now so kind of reflecting about that helped me I don't know I guess like find even more reason
[00:29:36.580] to not say these things but I mean it's still an active effort they definitely slip in there here
[00:29:42.340] and there I know it's so hard to stop saying it I feel like another thing that I've had to learn
[00:29:48.580] which I don't think I fully learned yet but I'm trying is I think it's easy for me when a friend
[00:29:54.580] starts to open up about tough times to think how can I be a supportive friend to this person
[00:30:00.100] but I found that sometimes that puts too much emphasis on me and how I'm acting and maybe the
[00:30:04.980] question is more so how does this friend want to be supported which I feel like is more similar to
[00:30:09.620] what Tiffy was kind of talking about earlier and even just like a simple switch of like the language
[00:30:15.540] the internal language that I'm using when I'm thinking through these situations might be able to
[00:30:20.900] help me better support this friend versus like oh what should I a supportive friend be doing
[00:30:28.420] that's a good one actually because I feel like in the situation where I'm supporting a friend and
[00:30:33.220] they're like spilling the tea on everything sometimes I'll sit there I'm listening but I want
[00:30:38.740] to show that I'm listening and it's kind of hard to like showcase to them how much you're trying to
[00:30:44.820] like be there for them so then you start thinking like how do I be a better friend or how do I look
[00:30:51.140] like a more supportive friend or how do I show them I am actively listening and it becomes about
[00:30:56.340] me versus like me really just being there and wanting to be that support for them but it's hard
[00:31:05.380] it's something that I feel like as humans and as adults or young adults it's something we need to
[00:31:11.700] actively practice and we will develop as we get older through time like no one is the best
[00:31:18.900] at comforting someone like it's hard to have that as a skill to really be that friend that
[00:31:24.580] people say like oh she really makes me feel heard or she makes me feel better it's hard
[00:31:29.060] it's really hard agreed I feel like because everyone is so different in the way that they
[00:31:34.340] want to be comforted so it's like extremely hard to be you know the perfect comforter dude I keep
[00:31:41.860] thinking about like blankets because we were saying comforter I definitely thought about blankets
[00:31:48.420] but I think both of you guys bring up good points like even just based on this conversation there's
[00:31:56.500] so many different things that we've learned over the years through our friendships on how to be
[00:32:01.540] a support to someone who's close to us it also makes me think like you know when I go to my
[00:32:07.060] friends and I'm like hey I've been really going through something or like I have this issue I
[00:32:10.900] can't stop thinking about x y and z I'm not sitting there like evaluating their performance as a friend
[00:32:17.380] on a scale of like a to f right like I feel like at the end of the day anytime I have a conversation
[00:32:22.180] with a close friend and I open up I walk away from that conversation feeling supported and
[00:32:28.180] I think a lot of that is obviously because my friends are putting in the work and putting
[00:32:32.580] in the effort to try to be there for me in a way that's maybe catered to myself but I think a lot
[00:32:38.100] of it too is like even just having that conversation and even just the fact that you're a friend someone
[00:32:44.100] is feeling comfortable enough to go to to have conversations like this means that you're a support
[00:32:49.060] already so maybe at the end of the day like while we consider these things on how to be supportive
[00:32:55.220] we don't necessarily have to feel too much pressure on being like the perfect friend right
[00:33:00.900] and we've talked a lot about what you should maybe avoid when you're trying to show the support to
[00:33:05.780] friends do you all have any tips that have been working for you when you're trying to show support
[00:33:10.980] for your friends I guess I'll start I feel like reacting in a really exaggerated manner
[00:33:18.180] of reflecting the emotion that they are showing me helps sometimes so maybe if the person is
[00:33:24.980] complaining like oh my god like this driver was so rude today and like cut me off I'd be like dude
[00:33:30.340] that sucks like I can't believe they cut you off so dangerously like oh my god that's you know so
[00:33:36.020] angering and I feel like that can really validate them they're like oh my god yeah I told the story
[00:33:41.140] and this person is feeling the same like angry emotion that I am so I think that I have found to
[00:33:48.980] work well sometimes yeah that's actually a good one I've noticed that sometimes when I'm like
[00:33:55.940] talking to Crystal and I'm like stressed about something she does that actually the exaggerated
[00:34:00.580] support reaction because I can respond back like I know right it's so upsetting and she's like yeah
[00:34:06.580] exactly and we just feels like very supportive because it feels like someone understands you
[00:34:11.620] and like what I feel it's like normal what my what I'm feeling at the time it's like completely
[00:34:18.020] normal because she also thinks it's a ridiculous like thing that happened to me thanks for being a
[00:34:23.620] good friend that's true actually I think I've noticed that too and it's so validating and
[00:34:30.660] comforting because the energy levels are like the same so I don't feel like I'm burdening because
[00:34:36.020] Crystal matches the energy and I'm like oh my god nice like then you can almost conclude the emotion
[00:34:42.260] quicker because you're like oh I've fulfilled this entire emotion of anger or stress or whatever
[00:34:47.700] yeah I think I've noticed it because I've definitely even seen myself where I react in a
[00:34:54.340] more like calm way because you know typically I'm very like quiet or like monotonous almost
[00:35:01.300] and then it just feels like not satisfying right for the other person
[00:35:05.140] it's like oh this like didn't even affect her is it like even valid
[00:35:11.780] so I think one thing that I've realized is a good strategy lately is not necessarily something that
[00:35:16.820] I always remember to practice with my friends but it's something that my friend told me when I was
[00:35:23.540] venting about something I've been going through I was talking with my close friend telling her
[00:35:27.540] about this tough time I've been experiencing and really the crux of the issue was that I was
[00:35:32.500] feeling all these emotions about a situation and I felt like they weren't valid emotions like I was
[00:35:38.020] like I know it's crazy for me to feel this but I like feel all these things and then she essentially
[00:35:44.100] told me no it's not crazy for you to feel this and here's why I've experienced something similar or
[00:35:49.700] you know I know someone who has gone through something similar so don't feel like you're
[00:35:53.300] crazy and I think instead of trying to be like yeah this isn't rational and trying to like
[00:36:00.500] intellectualize every single emotion that I had she told me that I should just be feeling and like
[00:36:05.460] consuming all of my feelings that way the moment can pass kind of quicker and it's also you know
[00:36:12.500] you're not trying to backtrack on things that your body is telling you or like that your heart
[00:36:17.140] is telling you and I feel like it was just such a simple tip but I really felt like she understood me
[00:36:22.580] and that in itself was like everything you know it like felt like it took weeks off of my shoulders
[00:36:29.060] basically yeah I like that I could totally see how that can be very helpful and it kind of all
[00:36:36.180] plays into what we were talking about earlier just like validating the person's emotions and feelings
[00:36:42.500] I think one way a friend has shown me a lot of support when I was going through a tough time
[00:36:46.980] was just letting me know that they were there with me I was pretty upset at whatever was going on
[00:36:53.540] and I was just like spilling like I could not shut up I was just going on and on and on I was going
[00:36:58.820] in circles again and the one thing that she just said like out of nowhere just like just that felt
[00:37:04.180] really comforting to me was like I'm here for you I'll always be here for you and it just feels like
[00:37:10.420] they don't have to have gone through the same situation they don't even really have to understand
[00:37:14.180] it but the fact that she says she's there for me and she's going to continue to be there for me
[00:37:19.620] just feels like someone's got your back no matter what and that also feels really good even if they
[00:37:25.220] can't understand the situation they'll never understand the situation or they'll never be
[00:37:29.060] placed in that type of situation it just feels like you have the support whether it's like through
[00:37:35.220] messenger or in person I feel like that's a very good line that has made me feel very comforted
[00:37:42.580] I like that one I feel like it's also one of those things that's very simple but the strength of the
[00:37:48.820] message is there yeah and I think what you said too about sort of like the actions of your friend
[00:37:54.820] just hearing you out on everything also reminds me that sometimes it's not even about the words
[00:38:00.660] it's about whether you show up for your friends it's about how much you're there when your friend
[00:38:05.220] needs them so not all of the weight is like in the exact vocabulary that we choose
[00:38:12.420] you know I actually had a thought here after we all shared things that we felt have been helpful
[00:38:18.500] to ourselves or to our friends and I think that we actually don't communicate that much
[00:38:25.540] about how we like to be supported and we did mention earlier in the episode that oftentimes
[00:38:32.340] we'll go to our partners for that support and I realized that it's because we talk to our partners
[00:38:37.380] about how we'd like to be supported and I mean like the only time where we talked about a friend
[00:38:44.500] sharing how they like to be supported was Tiffy's friend who shared the feedback about like you know
[00:38:50.020] Ashley when you say don't worry it's like not as effective so maybe like the moral of the story
[00:38:55.220] here is we should try to normalize sharing like how we like to be supported with our friends
[00:39:01.220] of course not during our like high emotion times but just like in our more regular like day-to-day
[00:39:06.740] lives and I feel like that could overall probably improve a lot of the support that we receive and
[00:39:12.980] give because then we have a better idea of like oh this friend likes to be supported this way
[00:39:17.860] that friend likes to be supported that way. That's a really good point actually. I think that also
[00:39:24.580] reminds me of how the calibration work could also be done in a different way as well so like I think
[00:39:31.620] one of the things that I've experienced is if I'm going through something and I need a specific type
[00:39:38.180] of response right whether it's high emotional like matching energy or it's actual real advice or maybe
[00:39:45.060] it's someone who can give me firm words or you know etc etc like I feel like I cater who I go to
[00:39:51.220] and who I share the story with based on what kind of response that might help me the most as well
[00:39:56.820] so then I think like you said open communication with your friends about like you know I think I
[00:40:00.980] prefer this kind of response more could also work and I think additionally just knowing that maybe
[00:40:07.540] your friend is coming to you for a specific response too might help alleviate the pressure
[00:40:11.700] a bit as well for sure and I'm really glad we spent time today to talk about this topic. I think
[00:40:18.980] we kind of don't talk about it enough maybe and everyone goes through tough times as we said
[00:40:24.740] so it's always nice to know that you know our friends are there and we can try to be our best
[00:40:29.700] supportive selves for our friends as well so thank you Tivy for joining us and for our listeners out
