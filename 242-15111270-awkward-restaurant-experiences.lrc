[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Obby.
[00:00:16.820] Welcome back, Obby. The last episode that Obby was on with us was episode 199, Wedding Plus One
[00:00:25.060] Guest Duties, which was a fun episode and I feel like we covered a lot of useful tips and funny
[00:00:30.900] stories. So if you're ever going to be a plus one for a wedding, definitely check out that episode.
[00:00:36.100] But today before we get to our topic, we have a Gen Z word slash phrase to talk about. And
[00:00:43.140] this one I actually love because I saw it with my own eyes come to fruition.
[00:00:50.500] I was shocked. I was like, wow, I was here for this part of history.
[00:00:54.340] So the word is actually a phrase. It's I fear. And the way you use it is kind of like a filler word,
[00:01:01.700] kind of like how you would use I think you say something and then you end it with I fear. So
[00:01:08.260] usually you try to say something funny and then you end it with I fear. So an example is the video
[00:01:15.140] that like really popped off to kick this off. Someone was asking questions about marriage. It
[00:01:20.420] was like a podcast and someone was asking questions about a marathon. He was like, I know
[00:01:25.140] nothing about marathons. Are they all the same length? And then the girl was like, yes, they are.
[00:01:31.540] And he was like, I'm so sorry. I just I don't know anything about this. And she was like, that's
[00:01:35.220] common knowledge. I fear. So the guy in that podcast, his name is Jake Shane, and he has a
[00:01:43.780] pretty big following on TikTok and him and his followers always use it. And it's so funny to me
[00:01:48.900] because he does like troll dances sometimes. Like you know, TikTok is known for the influencers
[00:01:53.620] doing like a cute dance or whatever. So he'll do that in a troll way. And then the comments will
[00:01:58.340] always be like, you ate that up I fear. It's so funny. Like it just makes it so ironic. And it's
[00:02:04.660] kind of like almost formal language. So I feel like it makes it even more funnier on top of that,
[00:02:09.700] too. I'm not gonna lie. I feel like you're just using normal English by saying
[00:02:13.780] it like that. Nothing about this seems like slang or like, different than just using words in their
[00:02:20.500] intended method.
[00:02:22.020] Obby doesn't get it I fear.
[00:02:25.380] I literally do not.
[00:02:29.940] You're just speaking English now? Like, is this even more boomer than Gen Z because you're using
[00:02:36.740] like formal English like in the ye olde days?
[00:02:39.700] Well, I feel like slang has to come full circle sometimes. Like we hit peak gibberish at
[00:02:44.980] skibbity toilet. Now we're circling back to like actual words again. So this is slang that you
[00:02:52.580] could use at the workplace. So it's a one plus one.
[00:02:58.180] I fear I may be getting fired.
[00:03:01.140] Oh no, you're using it wrong.
[00:03:02.580] That's just normal English.
[00:03:03.620] Or is it I may be getting fired I fear?
[00:03:07.140] Yeah, okay now it's slang.
[00:03:12.660] It has to be at the end of your phrase or sentence. You're right. It's like it's not
[00:03:18.580] changing anything. Like you kind of get it right away. There's nothing to define. But it's just
[00:03:24.500] the phrasing is funny.
[00:03:26.340] I do like the phrase I fear. It makes me feel more proper like I'm Oscar Wilde. It seems
[00:03:31.540] like something Oscar Wilde would say.
[00:03:33.140] I think that's like part of the charm to it. And then also I don't know like before so in
[00:03:38.420] that clip that I first saw this immediately at the end of the clip, I was like, dude, that
[00:03:42.900] was so funny what she said. And I was like, damn, should I try to like put that into my
[00:03:46.660] vocabulary? And I opened the comments and everyone's like, wow, she ate I fear you know,
[00:03:51.380] they're like immediately using it. Someone's like, wow, I'm gonna use that like that was
[00:03:54.660] so funny. And I was like, damn, we all have the same brain.
[00:03:57.860] I just googled I fear meme and nothing came up. How do I even like search for this?
[00:04:06.260] Maybe like I fear TikTok.
[00:04:09.140] It's common sense I fear. Is that right? Yeah, that's Oh, I see it. That's like common
[00:04:15.380] sense. I fear. I feel like I just lost brain cells.
[00:04:30.420] Actually, it replaces I feel like now that I think about it, because the format is like,
[00:04:35.460] I just lost brain cells. I fear Yeah, it's like it replaces I feel like and you put it at the
[00:04:41.460] end of the sentence instead of the beginning. I do like the idea of putting it at the end of
[00:04:46.180] the sentence that does make it more like, interesting. Makes me feel like I'm better
[00:04:50.980] at English. Maybe another layer to it is the like, oh, I'm so quirky. I talk quirky.
[00:04:59.220] Are we going back to that now? People who still wear suits to school?
[00:05:04.020] Oh, my God. The fedora is back.
[00:05:12.260] I kind of like it though. It's a good bit.
[00:05:15.060] We should have all gone to private school so we can wear suits to school every day.
[00:05:19.540] It's a little too late. I fear. I can't stop saying it. It's like too easy to incorporate.
[00:05:29.460] You don't even have to like say it at the end of your song. You'd like even wait a second.
[00:05:32.820] Just throw it in. Yeah, if you're late, you're like, I fear.
[00:05:38.980] Let us not forget.
[00:05:44.180] Well, I'm excited to see how we all drop in our I fears throughout the episode.
[00:05:49.140] But slaying aside, we do have a pretty funny episode topic today, which is awkward restaurant
[00:05:55.860] moments. I think every time you go out to eat at some sort of restaurant, there's something
[00:06:01.780] slightly awkward, slightly funny that happens. And I personally just have amassed so many different
[00:06:07.060] stories of things like that happening. So I'm kind of excited to dive into our various awkward
[00:06:12.100] situations together. So let's start by talking a little bit about ordering and awkward moments
[00:06:18.260] that come up when you order food at a restaurant. Is there anything that kind of comes top of mind
[00:06:22.580] for you? Immediately, I'm like reciting my order in my head prepping to go up.
[00:06:29.780] I feel like that's a common one. For me, I am very indecisive. So what I always do is somehow
[00:06:39.380] with the waiter will like turn to me and be like, what's your order? I'm like, please pick me last
[00:06:42.580] like somehow they always pick me first. Oh, you know what? It's because you're left handed and
[00:06:48.340] you set the edge of the table. Oh, bear. Okay. Also, I feel like the waiter usually asks the
[00:06:57.060] person who he makes eye contact with, like first slash the person who looks like they're
[00:07:02.260] at the head of the table. Obviously, you got to keep your eyes glued to that menu.
[00:07:06.980] Hot tip is dropped. Dude, I'd be studying that menu. I fear.
[00:07:17.060] The waiter's probably like, oh, this guy's the tallest. I'll choose him, I fear.
[00:07:22.420] I'm going to say that was a bad usage of my fear. I feel like it makes me
[00:07:26.020] not seem like the head of the table.
[00:07:30.340] Okay, I think it also depends though if you're like in a line or at the table. I feel like in
[00:07:36.020] the line sometimes there's even more pressure because you're like, oh fuck, I'm next. And then,
[00:07:43.540] okay, worst case, sometimes I let people behind me just go in front of me. I'm like,
[00:07:47.620] I feel like it depends where I'm at for when I feel nervous about the line. If it's like a
[00:07:54.020] bodega or like a bagel shop or something, it's like fast paced in there. It's a tense work
[00:07:58.820] environment. So then I'm like, you can just go ahead of me. I'm not ready for this. But if it's
[00:08:02.580] like Chipotle and there's a long line building behind me, I don't care.
[00:08:08.020] That's fair. Chipotle, you can make the decisions in the line.
[00:08:11.860] I feel like I also match the pace of the employee. So if they're super fast paced,
[00:08:17.860] then I'll be like, oh shit, yeah, I'll take this, this and this. But if they're going slow,
[00:08:23.540] they're kind of just lollygagging. But I'll lollygag too.
[00:08:26.980] But I think Chipotle is a special case too because it didn't really get big until we were
[00:08:31.700] in middle school. And I think it's like, oh, I'm not ready for this. And then I'm like,
[00:08:37.060] oh, I'm not ready for this. And I think it's a special case too because it didn't really get
[00:08:39.140] big until we were in middle school. And I remember the first time I went to Chipotle,
[00:08:44.420] I didn't know there were all these things you have to pick. And the thing too is like,
[00:08:49.940] Chipotle is not as bad about this, but sometimes at poke places or something,
[00:08:54.660] there's all these rules and restrictions, right? Like you get three proteins, you have five of
[00:08:58.260] this, you get this and avocado is $2 extra and like all these random things that you have to
[00:09:03.300] keep in mind. So then I feel like the first few times it took a lot of getting used to,
[00:09:08.100] of like, okay, I need to go in with a plan, one rice, one bean, one meat,
[00:09:12.820] because the first time was so like traumatizing.
[00:09:16.660] Wait, I feel that. I feel like poke place is a very good example for that. When they're like
[00:09:21.460] five veggies or whatever, I'm like, wait, I just want all of them.
[00:09:24.740] Or when you're like, there's like different styles of like the sashimi mixed with the sauces and
[00:09:30.900] you're like, hold on, I'm trying to like figure out what all of these are even called and like
[00:09:35.700] what's in them.
[00:09:37.940] Wait, the sauces?
[00:09:39.460] Oh, the sauces at poke places?
[00:09:41.300] Oh yeah.
[00:09:41.940] Yeah. Dude, they never say what's in them. I'm like, how am I supposed to know what your house
[00:09:46.580] sauce is?
[00:09:47.540] Wait, that's so true. I'm like, okay, house sauce is a gamble, but like usually, you know, maybe
[00:09:53.620] like 80% of the time it's good, but it's still a gamble. You have no idea what it is.
[00:09:58.500] I would just want them to tell me like, is it like a aioli type of thing or is it like a
[00:10:02.980] vinaigrette type? Like, just give me some information.
[00:10:05.940] Like, I don't need to know the flavor profile, but like...
[00:10:08.340] Yeah, I agree. I'm not like a huge mayo person for like poke, so I'm always like, okay, you know,
[00:10:14.340] usually ponzu or something, but you don't know for sure. Sometimes that house sauce is spicy mayo.
[00:10:20.740] Yeah, wait.
[00:10:22.180] Yeah.
[00:10:23.940] But I do agree. Chipotle has a leg up over everyone because I think it's so
[00:10:28.340] standardized now. Like a lot of us basically have our orders memorized and then maybe when we're
[00:10:33.700] there, we can make the split second decision like, oh, do I want to spice it up today and like
[00:10:39.060] change something? But for the most part, it's like, I at least stick to my usual order.
[00:10:44.260] I've been like back on a chipotle grind recently.
[00:10:47.460] Nice.
[00:10:47.780] And it's interesting to see that like how my order has changed since like high school.
[00:10:51.780] Now I can't get like the spicy salsa because it like fucks my stomach up in the middle of it. So
[00:10:56.900] it's really sad to be honest.
[00:10:58.900] Wait, I get it on the side sometimes and then I can control, you know, how much I'm mixing
[00:11:03.460] and make sure I'm like getting a couple scoops of rice in first to line the stomach.
[00:11:12.340] Oh my god. But I have realized with chipotle, I can't, at least in like the one I go to near
[00:11:17.380] my apartment, I can't order like pickup or delivery or like on the app or anything. Like
[00:11:22.820] I have to see them make it or else they put like nothing in the bowl.
[00:11:25.540] Yeah, that's the worst.
[00:11:27.060] Yeah.
[00:11:27.860] I think a funny thing though about going back to ordering in general, there's also
[00:11:33.300] some funny stuff that happens when you order with a big group. Usually I feel like they either go
[00:11:39.540] around one by one and take orders and it's like a little bit more casual. But sometimes when you're
[00:11:44.260] doing family style, I know like one person has to kind of step up to the plate and write
[00:11:49.060] everything down on their like phone notepad and rattle off the order to the waiter. And I'm always
[00:11:54.020] kind of interested to see like who does that role in big groups. I'm like damn it's kind of a power
[00:11:58.900] move.
[00:12:00.180] That's head of the table vibes.
[00:12:01.940] True. Oh my god. I'm thinking about it. I usually never end up with that task, but like I wouldn't
[00:12:07.780] mind doing that. But usually someone else just like, you know, steps up and does it. So I'm like,
[00:12:13.380] okay, I don't have to do anything.
[00:12:16.020] Even just coordinating what to order too is already a task. Like I feel like usually that's
[00:12:20.820] the person who ends up ordering it. The person has the most say or maybe was guiding the
[00:12:26.260] conversation on like guys we should order this.
[00:12:29.620] That's true. Oh actually there has been some situations though where maybe like I've been
[00:12:35.460] to the restaurant before so I'll kind of take charge of collecting the order. But then you
[00:12:41.220] know once the order is collected I'll be like, all right you go tell the waiter.
[00:12:45.780] Like the immediate delegation.
[00:12:51.300] Well what if you tell someone to do that and then they just go rogue and change the order?
[00:12:55.700] Whoa. That has not happened yet luckily.
[00:12:59.220] Just saying that's a possibility if you're giving that power to someone else.
[00:13:02.900] You're right though.
[00:13:05.460] Now I hope you ask me to order so I can try that.
[00:13:08.740] I'll keep in mind not to do that.
[00:13:13.780] I think sometimes though there's also a language restriction. So if you go to
[00:13:18.820] a specific type of restaurant then usually, I don't know if it's even true but I feel like
[00:13:23.860] sometimes we're like oh we feel the pressure to order in that language to get better service
[00:13:27.940] or something. Or maybe to like impress the wait staff. But I know if we go to like a
[00:13:32.500] Korean restaurant usually I'll be the one to kind of order the food. And it's a little bit
[00:13:36.660] of pressure actually because everyone's just watching you do it. And then afterwards people
[00:13:40.820] have like commentary about it. I'm like oh god. Whoa wait who has commentary about you're
[00:13:46.580] ordering food for them? I mean nothing like negative right but usually it's like whoa.
[00:13:53.060] I guess that's the commentary. That's commentary.
[00:13:56.420] I fear.
[00:14:00.100] Yeah like I noticed that like Chinese restaurants hear like Katie or Mel whoever will like order
[00:14:04.740] in Chinese. And it's like nice that they do that. But then also sometimes I never know what
[00:14:10.820] the dishes that we're ordering are because like they're ordering in Chinese. And then I'm like
[00:14:14.980] shit like if I like came back without them like I would be starting from square one. Like I have
[00:14:19.140] no idea what. Yeah so even when the food comes out I'm like oh like I know that's like spicy fish or
[00:14:24.580] like that's like whatever like beef stew or whatever. But like I don't know like the specific
[00:14:28.020] items on the menu. So then I'm like shit like I can't rebuild this order. That's actually a really
[00:14:33.380] good point because I don't know about you guys but I feel like in Chinese restaurants sometimes
[00:14:40.260] like there's just these standard dishes. So sometimes like people can go in and not even
[00:14:45.380] look at the menu and just be like hey do you guys make this dish? You know the waiter will be like
[00:14:50.180] yeah and they'll write it down for you. Like people just like don't even bother searching
[00:14:54.420] the menu you know. They're like okay these are like three of my favorite dishes that are usually
[00:14:58.100] kind of standard for Chinese restaurants. Do you make them? The menus are just like not even looked
[00:15:03.540] at. So I think that can happen for some pretty common things like dim sum. You know like some of these
[00:15:09.060] dishes are pretty standardized just like your typical like sit down Chinese restaurant with the
[00:15:15.060] with the circular tables. I don't even know how to like categorize that restaurant as but like
[00:15:19.620] the lazy susan white tablecloth restaurant. Yep yep usually in the morning they're dim sum and then
[00:15:25.540] you know like by the evening they're just like regular Chinese restaurant. Those ones will also
[00:15:29.940] have these kinds of like more standardized dishes. So I feel like that is maybe a unique thing to some
[00:15:36.580] of these Chinese restaurants but I'm sure if you you know said the English name they would they would
[00:15:42.500] know. True well I could see it going like oh do you have this spicy fish and he's like yeah we
[00:15:47.780] have like eight of them. That's true. He's like can I get the Chinese identifiers?
[00:15:54.020] Even like I'll like cook with Katie sometimes and she'll like get groceries from we and then I'll be
[00:15:59.460] like oh what's like the English name of like this vegetable so I can like go find it at like a
[00:16:03.860] grocery store near me if they have it. She's like uh I don't actually know or even like with stuff
[00:16:10.260] like like like Indian food that my mom will cook I'll ask her like oh what's like the English name
[00:16:14.260] for this she's like I don't know I can't help you here. I was like dude like how am I supposed to
[00:16:18.980] rebuild this stuff if there's no translation. Wait that's so true I feel like that is definitely
[00:16:24.500] something I've experienced too. Just like pause your look at a dish or something you're like I
[00:16:28.660] actually have no idea what the fuck the English name is for this.
[00:16:33.780] This one does not like it only exists in the language my secondary. Yeah it does not transcend
[00:16:42.260] it does not transcend language. Yeah but another thing about ordering in the language of the
[00:16:49.860] restaurant I've started to wonder lately like do we actually get better service when we do that?
[00:16:56.500] At this point I'm actually thinking that we're just trying to impress the waiters.
[00:17:01.140] Yeah probably. It's a good way to practice your other language. That's fair too. So my parents
[00:17:07.540] don't live in town anymore and I feel like the only real Korean interaction I get to use my
[00:17:12.820] language is at restaurants and then it's better now because I'm like used to it and my parents
[00:17:18.580] don't live that far anymore but dude the first few years where my parents first moved out of town I
[00:17:23.860] would go to a Korean restaurant and sometimes feel like almost sad or something like oh my god like
[00:17:29.220] mom like every waitress is my mom every waiter is my dad. Oh no. Which is very dramatic because I
[00:17:36.980] didn't have to really live that far away from them for a long time but still I was like oh my
[00:17:42.020] god this is my culture my forgotten culture. My adopted family. Oh I see see in that case you're
[00:17:52.020] speaking Korean to them maybe they felt that connection too they're like hey give my daughter
[00:17:57.220] out there the best soup today. Yeah she needs to eat. They're probably like why is this girl looking
[00:18:03.460] up at me so wistfully?
[00:18:08.020] But I think there's definitely some like level of pride or like impressed with yourself you're
[00:18:13.620] like oh yeah I just ordered that in like Chinese or Korean or like whatever right.
[00:18:18.420] True. Waiters like yeah I got you. I guess it makes you feel more part of that community almost.
[00:18:25.380] I remember there was this one time I was in Florence and I was like eating I decided to go
[00:18:30.100] to this Indian restaurant with two of my friends. I like did not know what to expect but then like
[00:18:34.340] the one guy working there he basically came up to us and he was like are you from India? I was like
[00:18:39.700] no but my parents are. He's like you get a 10 euro discount. Holy shit. Hell yeah.
[00:18:47.460] Damn that's hella worth it. And the place is pretty fire yeah. It was really interesting because
[00:18:51.860] like that restaurant so my parents had gone to Florence like maybe like six months before I was
[00:18:57.300] there and then they're like oh when you go like you have to try this Indian restaurant. I was like
[00:19:02.340] okay like I'm not I'm not gonna go to Florence and like eat Indian food but then it turns out
[00:19:07.540] that restaurant was right across the street from my apartment so it's literally like a 10 second
[00:19:11.140] walk so I was like shit I guess I have to go now and it was actually really good. It paid off.
[00:19:17.860] Yeah dividends 10 euros. That's pretty big. Yeah honestly there's nothing like seeing
[00:19:24.900] people from your like family's culture abroad in like Europe especially. Like every time I saw a
[00:19:30.580] Korean person I was like whoa squad. Yeah white people. You're like a piece of home. Yeah but um back to the
[00:19:38.420] ordering thing I just thought of something like so funny and awkward that I feel like happens a lot
[00:19:44.020] especially in big groups which is when you ask the waiter for recommendations you know they walk
[00:19:51.300] away they're like I'll give you a couple minutes to think about it and you huddle back up with your
[00:19:55.780] group right and you're like okay yeah basically fuck those recommendations that the waitress just
[00:19:59.940] told us let's just order what we originally said. Yeah that's so awkward like the peak awkward moment
[00:20:07.780] is when you ask the waiter like oh like what would you recommend and they say something and then like
[00:20:12.820] in the same moment you're like yeah no I'm gonna go with this other item like you're just making eye
[00:20:17.380] contact with you like have the pause you're like uh interesting I'm gonna go with this other item.
[00:20:23.220] You're like actually I'm ready to order and it's not that. Yeah thank you for helping me decide what
[00:20:29.140] I don't want. I feel that way too when the waiters come to like tell you what the special is and it's
[00:20:36.180] like before they come and talk to you about the special you probably have your order ready already
[00:20:40.900] but they still have to go through the speech right so you're just sitting there for like a minute while
[00:20:44.020] they're like oh today's special is this the fish of the day the soup of the day blah blah blah you're
[00:20:48.020] like okay thank you I'll have that meatball marinara. Oh are we at Subway right now?
[00:20:55.460] Sorry it's the first thing I thought of. I don't know why. You're getting the daily specials at Subway.
[00:21:02.980] But yeah very relatable. Also sometimes though when they do give these specials or you ask for
[00:21:08.740] wrecks I feel like kind of pressured to choose at least one thing that they wrecked because I'm
[00:21:13.700] like oh my god like you know we asked them they spent their time to list all these foods and like
[00:21:18.740] why they're good. I know we're not we weren't planning on ordering any of these but maybe we
[00:21:24.180] should just add this one appetizer in. Like you owe them one essentially. Yeah it's like when you go to
[00:21:29.700] like a store and like someone helps you out so much you're like should I have to buy something now?
[00:21:34.260] Exactly. Pity order. I feel like this could also get really awkward when you ask a sommelier or
[00:21:40.020] just like the waiter or whatever I'm looking for a red wine can you recommend something and then
[00:21:44.020] they're like yeah and then their finger goes on the wine list and goes all the way to the bottom
[00:21:47.620] to the most expensive bottles I'm like I'm not gonna f*****g drop this much money. What do I look
[00:21:53.620] like to you? Yeah I'm like do I look rich to you? Like I'm pretty sure I look really poor.
[00:21:58.900] Like I'm gonna need to move your finger up all the way up to the list.
[00:22:04.340] And it's just like oh shoot I definitely shouldn't have asked for that rec because
[00:22:08.420] they chose maybe like some outrageously expensive three to five hundred dollar
[00:22:12.900] bottle of wine and then you're like okay I'm ready to order I'll take this like fifty dollar
[00:22:17.780] bottle of wine. I'll take the second cheapest thing on the list. The move to like that I feel
[00:22:24.180] like works well to get around that and prevent awkwardness for all parties is to just like
[00:22:28.980] shortlist a couple ones that you're interested in. So like pick two or three be like oh like
[00:22:32.660] between these what would you recommend whatever you like or whatever you're eating. That's actually
[00:22:36.420] a good strat with the meatball marinara. And then they go to the bottom of the menu and they're
[00:22:39.620] like how about this one? Oh no! They're like those are great but like I have this other one you
[00:22:45.940] should see. What about this 2012 reserve? Yeah. We have something in the back room that would be
[00:22:52.820] perfect. Oh my god yeah. I have seen sometimes psalms will ask do you have a price range which
[00:23:00.900] I'm like oh thank god because I totally forgot I should have mentioned I have a price range.
[00:23:05.140] But you know sometimes they don't and you end up with that like 500 dollar rec and you're like oh
[00:23:12.660] thanks but no thanks. Tonight's not that special. Yeah. I feel like if it's like a actual psalm I
[00:23:20.420] guess and not just like a waiter I feel like they're pretty good about asking like what price
[00:23:24.660] range and stuff that you're looking for but I feel like sometimes waiters are just like oh have you
[00:23:29.620] considered. There was one time recently where I asked for a rec because it was like a nicer dinner
[00:23:36.260] there wasn't an official wine pairing so I was like oh shoot now we have to look through this
[00:23:41.220] like giant book of wine and choose something and I was like okay you know hopefully the psalm can
[00:23:46.100] narrow it down for us. So I asked and then you know the psalm starts flipping open the book and
[00:23:51.700] like more and more pages are getting flipped and I'm like oh oh no like I fucked up basically right
[00:23:58.580] and I was praying in my mind as his fingers moving in slow motion I'm like please don't
[00:24:02.900] choose the most expensive bottle and then first one he chooses like a relatively expensive bottle
[00:24:09.140] but then second one he actually chooses one that I was thinking about in my mind and I was like oh
[00:24:13.940] my god yes like thank you so much like now I can choose one of those good yeah I was like now I
[00:24:19.940] could choose one of their recs within my price range and it's been validated by the psalm.
[00:24:26.900] Yeah dude that book of wine is so intimidating I mean Crystal you actually know stuff about wine
[00:24:32.420] but I feel like for me and James the vocabulary that we use to describe our wine is so limited
[00:24:39.300] it's literally like hmm this is smooth this is sweet this is dry this is acidic and that's like
[00:24:45.380] it so then when they're like oh what kind of wine do you like I'm like I don't know what kind of wine
[00:24:49.620] should I like? I don't know what do you think? Dude next time you should just be like I like good wine
[00:24:59.060] I like smooth wine. But I think usually if you ask that first you can start off with like do you
[00:25:05.700] prefer white or red and then from there you can go for like just throw in some random fruit notes
[00:25:12.020] or you could be like I like fruity wine or you could be like I like more like minerally wine
[00:25:18.820] yeah that's already too many words for me I'm maxed out on my vocabulary. I see identify mineral flavor
[00:25:26.180] okay actually if you if you like fruity wine then you could say that you'd be like oh I like wine
[00:25:31.780] with more like fruity notes they'll get it and they'll be like okay it'll usually end up tasting
[00:25:37.060] like maybe a little more juicy almost if even if it's not like full-on sweet anyway I'll give you
[00:25:44.100] guys a wine lesson later. I will say sometimes I do something mildly egregious and I did this more
[00:25:51.780] like overseas and stuff or sometimes at like nicer restaurants but I have this app called Vivino
[00:25:57.300] and it's like a wine rating app right so akin to how you would look up a restaurant and be like oh
[00:26:02.260] what's the you know top foods at this place I sometimes search like a couple of the wines on
[00:26:07.300] the list and pick the highest rated one and it actually kind of works in a pinch but it's just
[00:26:12.500] mildly embarrassing to have like Vivino and like type in the grape name. The waiter sees you like
[00:26:19.220] using your phone under the table. The song comes by do you have any questions? Nah I'm good
[00:26:24.420] You're like no Google's helping me. I do that too sometimes actually I'll like look up some because
[00:26:32.580] you know sometimes these wines are like maybe the same wine but different years or they're just like
[00:26:38.020] really similar and I'm like okay realistically like what is the difference here I don't know
[00:26:42.180] like the paper can only tell me so much. Right. Wait I have a question have you guys picked a
[00:26:47.220] wine and then you know they give you like the little taste tester have you ever been like no
[00:26:51.140] I don't like this oh and got something else no I'm too embarrassed because I personally have never
[00:26:55.860] yeah I'd be like oh yeah this is phenomenal great choice. Wait actually speaking of that a funny
[00:27:02.100] thing happened so yesterday Jisoo and I and like some of our girlfriends we went up to Napa
[00:27:08.740] and Melissa was with us and Melissa's also like kind of into wine at our lunch spot we ordered
[00:27:15.700] a bottle and someone you know the waiter pours a little taste and I was like oh Mel should taste
[00:27:20.340] this one. Mel tasted it and she's like thumbs up to the waiter right waiter starts pouring them all
[00:27:25.620] he leaves and then she was like oh actually I don't know if I like this wine and I was like
[00:27:33.220] perhaps the time to speak up was earlier. And she was like yeah and she was like I mean like you know
[00:27:40.660] it's still it's still enjoyable like we like I can drink it everything but it's like not my favorite
[00:27:45.380] one like we could have maybe gotten a better one for like the same price she was just like but you
[00:27:50.180] know the guy already uncorked it like I felt bad. I feel like if anyone was to to speak up about
[00:27:57.540] I don't actually like this one Mel would be the right candidate yeah but actually when people do
[00:28:03.700] that like they give you a little taste it's more to make sure that the wine didn't go bad in the
[00:28:09.140] bottle so if you're tasting you're like oh this is like weird this is funky I don't think it's supposed
[00:28:13.060] to taste like this then you tell them and then they'll be like oh so sorry and they'll get you
[00:28:17.460] like a new bottle of the same wine though yeah so it's not like an ice cream sample yeah
[00:28:24.740] I think like technically you can be like oh I don't like this wine can we get a different one
[00:28:29.940] but I guess kind of out of like respect people try not to do that it's like I made the choice bad
[00:28:36.260] manners yeah a little bit especially if they like you know open the bottle for you brand new and
[00:28:42.420] it's like a bottle only wine not like a wine by the glass so I think like usually people try not
[00:28:49.060] to do that but I think technically you can't and the waiters are not gonna be like no you can't
[00:28:56.180] get a new bottle you know you'll just be banned from the restaurant after this I hate being the
[00:29:01.780] one to do that little wine tasting though because I know it's supposed to be a mechanism for us as
[00:29:07.220] a consumer to be able to taste the wine but I still feel like I'm obligated to give some sort
[00:29:11.940] of performance or something where I like do the swirl no idea what I'm fucking doing
[00:29:15.620] I smell it I drink it I'm like exquisite
[00:29:24.100] and because you did all that the waiter is now like oh she knows wine yeah
[00:29:29.940] I'm like I hope he wasn't able to tell that I don't know anything about wine
[00:29:34.500] I love a good performative dance
[00:29:38.100] dude I feel like a lot of things at restaurants are performative because
[00:29:40.980] this kind of ties back to like speaking the language of the you know the waiters and wait
[00:29:45.780] staff it's kind of performative right you're like hey I'm one of you guys like be impressed with me
[00:29:50.900] please so true yeah just want special treatment yeah something about being out there and hey look
[00:29:58.820] at how I'm eating this food aren't I so great yeah oh my god actually earlier this year James and I
[00:30:06.900] went to New York and there's a lot of really nice restaurants in New York right so I remember we
[00:30:11.380] went to eat at this one place that service at that place was really nice like the waiters would
[00:30:15.620] always come and talk to you after they cleared out each dish of like the course menu essentially
[00:30:20.580] but it got to the point where after every single dish we were eating they were like oh how was it
[00:30:25.780] the first few times I was like oh so good like whatever and then after like the fifth time I
[00:30:29.780] was like am I supposed to be thinking of new things to say or like how are other tables doing it
[00:30:35.140] because I'm just sitting here like it's good it's good like a fucking it was good robot and I was
[00:30:40.100] like is this boring for the waiter you know so then eventually I tried to be like oh I love that
[00:30:46.180] the fish was soft and like try to think of all these things and then I was like why am I doing
[00:30:51.300] all this like extra labor and like getting anxious when they walk up and shit oh my god your meal
[00:30:57.940] became a brain exercise a pop quiz exactly like how many vocabulary words do you have for good
[00:31:08.020] I know it was like good for like half the courses oh my god but then I started listening in on other
[00:31:12.500] tables and seeing what they said and then I like took inspo from there but honestly this is a lot
[00:31:17.700] of work to do over a meal would not recommend you started copying other people's homework
[00:31:23.940] you're cheating on the test
[00:31:29.060] wait I'm not gonna lie when when that happens to me I'm literally a broken record I'm like so good
[00:31:35.140] so good so good by the end I'm like they should know I'm about to say so good
[00:31:42.340] I feel like I've noticed when the waiter asked me like what I think I if I say like oh yeah like
[00:31:47.540] that was really good then that probably means it was like fine but if I actually like use other
[00:31:51.860] adjectives or descriptors then like then that was like oh it was really good like when I like put in
[00:31:57.540] the thought to like think of why it was good that's how I know I really liked it yeah but if it was
[00:32:02.100] just whatever then I'll be like yeah that was good that's true I see I see okay one thing that I've
[00:32:06.820] started incorporating a little more is when they ask and I had like a dish that I legitimately
[00:32:12.980] think was maybe the best of the meal I'll say that I'll be like oh my god this one was so good I
[00:32:17.220] think it might be my favorite so far the waiters get excited they're like oh my god me too like
[00:32:21.460] that's my favorite dish I'm like nice A+. What if every dish gets better and better though what if
[00:32:29.460] after every course like oh this is the best dish
[00:32:32.820] he's like again really
[00:32:36.580] how generic well um luckily that hasn't happened yet but I'll let you know if it does
[00:32:44.900] what I find crazy though I feel like there's people like us where we kind of give the generic answer
[00:32:49.220] and then maybe like spice up a couple of the really good ones but there's also people who like
[00:32:54.180] engage a lot with the wait staff or like with the chefs or the salms or whatever so recently I was
[00:33:00.980] at this restaurant and we kind of were seated at private tables but there weren't that many so you
[00:33:05.220] can definitely hear what other people were saying right we had some sort of like duck course and
[00:33:10.020] then the waiter came by and was like clearing our plates saying like oh how was it me and james were
[00:33:14.260] like oh so good blah blah he moves on to the next table he's like how was it and the guy was like
[00:33:19.620] it was really salty oh my god I was like oh my god what the fuck and I'm like ear is open listening
[00:33:25.300] to this conversation and the waiter was like oh I'm sorry like just yours or you know your partners
[00:33:30.740] as well like the other person at the table he was like yeah both of ours and this was like a slightly
[00:33:36.020] nicer restaurant so then I feel like when you're paying a lot of money you are kind of more entitled
[00:33:41.700] to share these opinions and like feedback back but I was like wow like I don't think I would ever
[00:33:47.620] say something like that you know dude I don't have the gull
[00:33:52.260] I don't think I would do it depends like how not edible it is okay that's because I remember there
[00:33:58.100] was like one time we got like some seafood pasta type of thing and it was like really salty and I
[00:34:03.860] was like after a couple bites like okay like this like you can't even like power through this so
[00:34:07.220] then we told the waiter he's like oh I'm so sorry there's nothing we can do for you oh that's how it
[00:34:12.740] tastes I was like uh would not recommend ordering that dish
[00:34:19.700] he was like I'm sorry you feel that way that's how it's supposed to taste
[00:34:25.940] he puts you back into your place that's all right then I mean I think it makes sense though because
[00:34:31.380] it's like we all understand that like working in a restaurant is hard you know making this food
[00:34:37.700] and prepping and like serving on these people is very tiring so I feel like every time you know we
[00:34:42.820] have something to nitpick it's like oh my god like I don't want to put even more work on their plate
[00:34:48.820] but I guess at some certain points it's like okay actually this needs to be like something
[00:34:54.420] needs to be said here so it's like finding that balance of like when the correct time to like
[00:35:00.100] cross the line is yeah maybe the the right move is to think of some like ways to say you don't
[00:35:06.340] like the food without being mean and just have them in your back pocket ready to go maybe you'd
[00:35:12.180] be like oh it's a little salty for me is there anything I can add to change do you have a cup
[00:35:17.060] of water I could pour into this dish so that's less salty I can dilute
[00:35:24.500] do you have a stove I can use so I can cook the rest of this
[00:35:27.540] I guess for me if there's like shit in the food I'll say something you know like the plastic wrap
[00:35:37.140] I don't know like a dead fly or something right oh or yeah like a plastic wrap or you know something
[00:35:42.020] that's like you're like okay this needs to like get out of the food I'll probably try my best
[00:35:47.220] to say something yeah I feel like that that's a fair one to bring up no no harm no foul yeah I
[00:35:52.900] guess because that one feels less bad because you're like oh it's not that the food is bad it's
[00:35:56.580] just that like some random shit has fallen here that like I don't think it's supposed to be in
[00:36:00.740] here player three has entered the food exactly oh I thought of another like kind of awkward
[00:36:07.380] silly situation it goes back to you know ordering the food do you ever kind of like scope out the
[00:36:14.180] tables around you and be like oh that looks really good like maybe we should order that
[00:36:19.220] you're like flipping in the menu to try to find a photo of what that could be or you're like take a
[00:36:24.100] photo or like you're like zooming in with your eyes like what is in that dish like what is it
[00:36:31.460] wait yeah I feel like when I'm like walking into a restaurant and as I'm reading the menu I'm like
[00:36:35.620] like when I'm walking I'm like looking over like everyone's table to be like what did you order like
[00:36:40.260] is it good does it look good yeah because I feel like when you look at like google or like yelp
[00:36:44.420] pictures of like food a lot of them now are from like the restaurant owners themselves and it's
[00:36:48.660] like the really like studio lighting and just like the like when you see like the mcdonald's ads
[00:36:53.620] like the burger never looks like that yeah I'm like I want to see what the real deal looks like
[00:36:57.620] that's a good move like looking over everyone's shoulders but then sometimes they'll catch you
[00:37:02.180] and then you're like my dad wait so that actually happened once I was at a restaurant with my mom
[00:37:07.220] and my dad you know we're deciding what to order and then my mom keeps looking over her shoulder
[00:37:11.940] and she's not even being subtle about it she's like oh that table behind us ordered that one dish
[00:37:16.180] with like noodles and stuff looks pretty good like maybe we can order that and then she she
[00:37:20.500] like mentions it a couple other times and then finally the table like behind us one of the people
[00:37:25.700] they turn around they're like oh actually it's not noodles it's like tofu skin and she's like
[00:37:30.500] and it's like this one on the menu and I was like oh my god like so yeah I was like I was like
[00:37:36.340] actually it's not too embarrassing because they were really nice about it but my mom was laughing
[00:37:40.980] because she's like oh my god I said the dish wrong so many times that the person like couldn't hold
[00:37:45.380] it in anymore she's like actually like they're not noodles like this is the last straw
[00:37:53.380] she's just fuming at her table eating her not noodles
[00:37:58.820] she's like I can't just sit here silently and let them be misled like that
[00:38:03.220] I must speak up oh my god is that the new move then instead of just asking like the waiter or
[00:38:09.460] the waitress for recommendations also ask all the other tables so what you guys order
[00:38:17.060] would you recommend it I have definitely had people ask oh my god what is that that you
[00:38:22.980] ordered that looks really good but it's like usually a few and far in between but yeah I feel
[00:38:27.860] like I've noticed that the older the person is the like less I guess embarrassed or like nervous
[00:38:35.620] they are about it they just like walk up they're like hey what'd you order here like that looks
[00:38:38.980] fucking great and you're like oh yeah they really don't give a fuck it's very admirable it really
[00:38:43.380] is I'm like wow how do I be more like that even like when you're talking about your mom like doing
[00:38:49.300] that I'm like that's that's crazy to like just keep speaking up about that I don't think I would
[00:38:53.940] do that yeah I was like mom stop they're gonna hear you I feel like it is the go-to move though
[00:39:02.420] it is sometimes if I don't observe the tables around me I'll get like buyer's remorse like
[00:39:07.780] last time we went to try out some sort of restaurant we got so excited about the menu we
[00:39:11.140] like sat down ordered the stuff that looked good we finished ordering and then that's when you like
[00:39:15.620] come to right and like become aware of your surroundings again and then we looked around
