[00:00:00.110] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal
[00:00:16.090] So we have a new Gen Z word today
[00:00:19.010] and I think it's a fun one because it's actually kind of like an
[00:00:23.470] evolution of one of our first Gen Z words and
[00:00:26.870] One of those OG Gen Z words that we talked about is Riz which you know is kind of connected to like charisma
[00:00:33.590] So this new word Jeesoo actually brought today and it is also
[00:00:38.630] attached to the
[00:00:40.190] concept of charisma
[00:00:42.190] So the word is aura
[00:00:44.270] Dude, aura is so funny
[00:00:45.830] And it's one of those words where I feel like once you see it and you recognize that this new generation is using this slang
[00:00:53.470] You can't unsee it. Like I've been seeing it everywhere on tik-tok and the format that I've been seeing it is
[00:01:00.030] Usually it'll be some sort of compilation of things that make you unattractive or attractive and then they'll gauge
[00:01:06.990] Points based on whatever that action is
[00:01:09.150] So for example, it's like if you accidentally fall asleep in class and your head falls off your hand
[00:01:15.030] Minus 1,000 aura. Oh my god
[00:01:18.270] Wait, I actually have not been seeing it used like that for me
[00:01:21.710] I've just kind of seen it being used as an alternative to vibes
[00:01:27.710] Yeah, so like oh this person has aura or to be fair I haven't seen it that much on tik-tok
[00:01:33.490] But in the few instances that I have it's like oh
[00:01:36.910] Like what is this aura?
[00:01:40.070] I want to see like what the actual origin is because I think you're right
[00:01:44.430] Like there's probably multiple ways that people are using it
[00:01:46.750] It's just such a funny concept to me that you could assign points values or even if you're saying
[00:01:53.790] Oh, someone is really cool saying that aura is so creative. Yeah, I like it
[00:01:59.350] It's very like it's almost sophisticated like Riz definitely feels like slang right?
[00:02:03.650] Like it's kind of a made-up word but aura is like a real word and it's like ooh, that's like kind of mystical
[00:02:11.110] Yeah, I think mystical is the right word. It's spiritual. Yeah, I could almost see the person's energy transcending out of their body
[00:02:17.830] Dude, yeah
[00:02:18.950] So I have found it on know your meme and it says
[00:02:24.310] Aura is the slang term popularized online in 2023 and 2024
[00:02:29.910] Often used to compliment men for their charisma or presence
[00:02:33.990] The term first grew prevalent in soccer and basketball communities on
[00:02:39.910] X-slash Twitter
[00:02:41.430] Likely due to people commending Liverpool player van Dyke for his aura. Okay, I don't follow soccer
[00:02:48.470] So I can't really comment on this
[00:02:51.510] And then it says jokes about gaining and losing aura points also notably spread on tik-tok in May
[00:02:59.470] 2024 dude, you are like on the forefront of this wave
[00:03:04.710] Actually, you are cuz you know
[00:03:06.850] Original way people use it and I've been only seeing it in the latest way
[00:03:11.010] That's so funny though, but you're seeing like real time. It's we're still in May right now
[00:03:16.930] Yeah, I dedicate a lot of time to research for this segment. Oh
[00:03:22.610] Okay. So in this origin section, it says there was an article
[00:03:27.370] Way back from October 2020 that said Van Dyke's mistakes, dude
[00:03:32.930] I actually don't even know if I'm pronouncing this guy's name, right? But hopefully I am
[00:03:38.290] Van Dyke's mistakes can be dismissed because basically he has an aura. I guess that's the original article that
[00:03:46.730] Started memes Wow
[00:03:48.930] Huh, that's interesting
[00:03:50.570] You would not think that this kind of stuff would come from a New York Times article
[00:03:54.370] Unless they were just using verbiage that fans were using on Twitter like prior or something
[00:03:58.990] Yeah, and also it's like an older article so someone like dug this up and was like hey
[00:04:05.190] We should start using this word now
[00:04:08.190] My only beef with this word is I will say saying aura is I don't know how to say
[00:04:13.990] It's like labor-intensive for my brain and my tongue
[00:04:16.750] It just doesn't feel like my tongue goes the right way to properly say it. Like I always want to be like
[00:04:22.030] Our or something. Oh, yeah, there's too many vowels in this word. Yeah
[00:04:26.910] confusing
[00:04:28.270] So this one gets like a B rating from me. I also
[00:04:32.750] Whenever I think of this word nowadays, I think of like the aura ring, you know the like
[00:04:38.310] Oh, yeah, the like health tracking right? Yeah
[00:04:41.590] I think that's like the first thing that comes to mind because aura is not really like a super commonly used word
[00:04:48.710] Prior to this meme so, you know once that ring came out, I was like, okay, that's like very notable, you know funny enough
[00:04:55.590] I feel like growing up I heard the term aura more often in Korean than in English
[00:05:00.350] Because I feel like when I was growing up at least people would kind of use it a lot to talk about someone's vibes or energy
[00:05:06.670] Whereas in the US, I feel like if we were to talk about it, we would literally just use vibes and energy and not like aura
[00:05:12.310] Yeah, okay. Actually there is another place that I hear aura a lot
[00:05:17.230] I don't remember if I ever mentioned this on the podcast, but sometimes to go to sleep
[00:05:23.510] I listen to like tarot reading videos on YouTube
[00:05:30.190] So they say aura in there sometimes but you know, it's not in the in the slang slash meme way
[00:05:37.230] You have like shifty eyes. Are you embarrassed about watching tarot card readings?
[00:05:41.430] Don't be embarrassed. I'm not embarrassed, but I feel like with no context is very strange
[00:05:47.390] It's a little odd right because I'm not like into it
[00:05:50.710] But usually people who make these videos have nice soothing voices
[00:05:54.910] It's like the perfect background noise because the videos are like an hour to two hours long
[00:06:00.150] So I just turn it on and then listen to it and doze off
[00:06:04.790] It creates the perfect aura
[00:06:08.670] Well auras aside we do have a pretty interesting topic to talk about today, which is decision-making
[00:06:15.670] We really wanted to talk about the thoughts or elements that we use to help guide our daily decision-making
[00:06:21.630] whether it's big decisions or even small ones down to what kind of clothes you're gonna wear because I feel like sometimes
[00:06:28.590] Decision-making is an art and it is also
[00:06:33.350] laborious in some senses definitely, so let's talk about it today. Do you think you're
[00:06:39.110] Primarily a decision maker or a follower
[00:06:42.590] So I think I kind of vacillate in between those two things. I feel like when I was younger
[00:06:47.470] I was more of a decision maker. So even in a friend group, I bet oh, let's go do this
[00:06:53.110] I felt like I had stronger thoughts and opinions maybe
[00:06:57.590] But going into my late 20s, I've been noticing that I am more of a decision-making follower now
[00:07:03.830] So I tend to default to being a support position and let someone else make the bigger decisions
[00:07:11.910] Mmm. Well, I think I might be kind of the opposite of you. I
[00:07:15.910] want to say I was probably more of a follower when I was younger and then maybe now I
[00:07:23.150] Make more decisions, but I think it's also like the nature of
[00:07:27.470] Being an adult there's like certain decisions that you have more power over now versus like, you know
[00:07:32.430] People telling you what to do in the past
[00:07:34.750] But if we were to think about like friend groups and stuff, I'm probably still more of a follower
[00:07:40.830] Yeah, it's interesting. I do feel like people kind of
[00:07:44.350] Change and I'm sure certain time periods also affect the way we approach this as well
[00:07:49.150] But I don't know
[00:07:50.390] I just feel like as someone who maybe used to decision make more often in the past
[00:07:55.270] there's just something so much more compelling about being a follower because
[00:07:59.910] Decision-making comes with a lot of responsibilities. I feel like once you take one kind of baton
[00:08:07.150] Even if it's as a one-time thing, I feel like it's hard to
[00:08:11.230] Relinquish that power later on and it becomes expectations and you know
[00:08:16.150] This is something that happens often in friend groups, but also in a workplace setting too
[00:08:21.350] So then I think as someone who used to be more happy to make decisions
[00:08:25.150] I realized all the benefits that come with not being like the one person to do all that. Wait, that's so true
[00:08:31.710] I feel like every time I
[00:08:33.790] Maybe like take charge in a group and make some decisions. It's like so stressful
[00:08:38.790] I'm always worried like oh my god, did I make the right decision? Is everyone going to enjoy the decision?
[00:08:44.510] It's hard to please everyone
[00:08:46.830] Yeah, that's kind of like the natural thought I have like oh shoot. What am I gonna do if someone pushes back?
[00:08:52.110] Yeah, and I would instantly crumble
[00:08:55.110] I feel like there's been so many times where I'm like, oh like this would be so fun
[00:08:59.590] I have some idea and I go to rally the troops
[00:09:02.430] Whenever I hit some sort of roadblock like maybe one person doesn't really want to do it or this person would prefer something else or
[00:09:08.430] Like there's logistical things that come up. I'm like, why did I choose to put myself in this position?
[00:09:13.390] And I think as someone who has anxious thoughts about does everyone hate me or whatever being the decision-maker
[00:09:19.790] Easily triggers that so then I learned why put yourself in a position where you're gonna trigger your personal anxieties, right?
[00:09:26.830] True true. It's a lot less stressful to be a follower. So I commend every group decision-maker out there
[00:09:34.750] Yes, but when you do have to make these decisions
[00:09:38.550] Do you have any like strategies because as we discussed it's like it's kind of hard
[00:09:42.590] So I guess it depends on the magnitude of what decision we're making but I'll start with something
[00:09:48.110] That's bigger and maybe has more like potential consequences and whatnot
[00:09:52.510] so I am of the philosophy that
[00:09:56.190] Decision-making should run off the most risk averse path and also the path of least resistance
[00:10:02.950] And I think that's actually probably
[00:10:06.110] controversial or not controversial, but I think a lot of people would have a different philosophy where you try to go for like
[00:10:12.030] Optimizing profit or like optimizing gain essentially and not like minimizing risk
[00:10:16.750] But I think for me and just the way my brain works
[00:10:19.750] I have to before making a decision run through every single potential scenario in my head
[00:10:25.510] And then that's what helps me guide my decision-making
[00:10:29.310] I think sometimes it's positive in the sense that I can really start to prepare for everything
[00:10:36.150] That could potentially happen at least within my knowledge
[00:10:38.990] And then it makes me make a more nuanced decision versus just like I want to do this
[00:10:43.510] I'm gonna do it
[00:10:44.350] But I think on the flip side
[00:10:46.190] It might mean that I don't necessarily challenge myself if I'm always going on the path of least resistance
[00:10:52.790] Or the most risk averse path, so I think there's pros and cons
[00:10:57.550] But at the end of the day
[00:10:58.830] I think I just can't make a big decision without literally running through like the SWOT analysis of strengths weaknesses
[00:11:05.030] opportunities and threats of the decision
[00:11:08.030] Interesting, but what if it's like the path of least resistance is
[00:11:14.230] Significantly less gain. I mean it's like weighted right? It's not like each thing is equal
[00:11:19.150] So if there's something to gain and it's not too much resistance
[00:11:24.670] I feel like it's still definitely worth pursuing
[00:11:27.230] But I feel like to me it has to feel like a balanced decision
[00:11:30.710] Like I'm not gonna just go chasing for the most high margin thing if the other factors don't make sense either
[00:11:38.150] Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I'm trying to think if I have a lot of
[00:11:43.310] Analysis in my decision-making
[00:11:45.590] But I feel like sometimes I'm just like oh I need to do this. I'll just do it
[00:11:49.430] Hmm, but it also depends because if it's like something you don't want to do then I'm kind of like
[00:11:54.670] Do I really need to do it?
[00:11:56.710] Can I put it off for longer?
[00:11:58.990] But I think there are definitely moments where I
[00:12:02.030] Don't think about it. I just like go for it
[00:12:04.230] But I think those are usually like smaller decisions because you're right usually if it's like something bigger, there's definitely some
[00:12:10.630] Planning or like pre-thought to it. So sometimes if it's like medium, I'll have pre-thought it like okay tomorrow
[00:12:17.230] I need to do this and like these are the necessary steps just very generally from there kind of just like take action
[00:12:25.470] Dude, yeah, I always find it funny because you and I have very different approaches to decision-making
[00:12:31.430] and I feel like a really stark example in my eyes is
[00:12:36.350] New York. So I remember when you had initially told me you were gonna move to New York me and James spent some time
[00:12:44.350] Around a similar time period wondering if like we should move to New York as well
[00:12:48.790] I think you decided you were kind of like thinking about it and then you decided in a really really short period of time
[00:12:55.630] And you were like, yeah, I'm just gonna do it
[00:12:57.870] I might have this friend check out some of the places there
[00:13:01.070] But I think I'm literally just gonna like go and do it versus for me
[00:13:04.950] I ran like a whole almost like a multiple scenarios of like, okay for my five-year plan
[00:13:11.710] If I were to move to New York
[00:13:13.390] How far would that push out our home buying process or how much would that set us back savings wise and what's the opportunity cost like
[00:13:20.630] What am I gaining? And what am I losing from moving to New York?
[00:13:23.110] So you can see in our decisions you clearly moved to New York. I
[00:13:27.430] You know thought about it with James ran through the numbers decided it did not make sense for me and James and our lifestyle
[00:13:34.310] I just find it so funny like the contrast of like my spreadsheets and then you're like, yeah
[00:13:40.030] I'm gonna move and I'm gonna book like a moving pod
[00:13:43.790] Not to make light of your decision, but it's just like the approach is slightly different
[00:13:48.270] No
[00:13:48.630] That's so true because a lot of the analysis that you just described that you went through
[00:13:53.510] Happened after for me like once I moved back from New York. I was like, oh, yeah
[00:13:57.710] I guess like this kind of pushed some of these general timelines back and then I was like, hmm
[00:14:03.390] Oh, well, well, you know, it's already done. So this is just life now
[00:14:06.510] I
[00:14:09.430] Feel like it's funny cuz
[00:14:11.590] Honestly running all the numbers and doing the analysis does have strong benefits and it's like soothing for me as a person
[00:14:17.950] but then also I feel like if you go and you do it and you come back and
[00:14:22.790] You know, you are maybe like one or two years away from your goal or whatever doesn't really matter that significantly
[00:14:29.390] you know so then I think sometimes there is a trap if you're like a very anxious and like analytical person of falling into
[00:14:36.230] Analysis paralysis and then just being unable to move forward or make progress in any decision, dude
[00:14:43.270] I feel that but also when you were thinking about that like, you know, New York decision
[00:14:48.630] it was you and James so I feel like when it's two people and you have like a
[00:14:53.590] Units timeline to consider it's a lot more to think about for me. I was like, okay
[00:14:58.350] Well, I have like not much to lose
[00:14:59.910] It's like just me out here and I think there were some pros that ultimately were like unique to me as well that helped push
[00:15:07.510] the decision but I totally get the analysis paralysis thing a lot the number one example I can think of is
[00:15:14.590] Sometimes and this happened a lot back in college
[00:15:17.630] Dinner time would be coming up and I'd be like, okay. What should I eat for dinner?
[00:15:21.030] Don't feel like cooking today cuz back in college. I like never cooked
[00:15:24.870] So, you know sit down pull out my phone and like start scrolling through Yelp or like Google Maps or something
[00:15:32.230] Just like scrolling through all of the different food options
[00:15:35.510] And the craziest part is like we lived in the same place for like the whole time that we were in school
[00:15:42.270] It's like generally the same area. So, you know, I knew everything that was around us
[00:15:47.470] Yeah
[00:15:47.970] I'm still mindlessly scrolling through this list taking forever to think about what to eat. And then the next thing I know I'm like
[00:15:54.770] Oh shit, it's like 10. Everything's closed. I guess I'll just eat some bread
[00:15:59.210] Go to sleep. Oh
[00:16:00.850] My god that actually reminds me of something that I feel like I learned so late into my life
[00:16:06.770] But I think it's kind of obvious which is there are certain times
[00:16:10.570] You should be decision-making and certain times that you should not be using that brain
[00:16:14.730] I feel like the biggest example, like you said is choosing food and whatnot
[00:16:18.730] So if I leave all of like my weeknight meal decision-making for 6 p.m
[00:16:24.810] After I'm done with work that day, I am eating out like I am door-dashing
[00:16:28.970] there's no way I'm able to make that decision but if I meal plan sort of ahead and
[00:16:34.730] I like have my grocery list set out and everything kind of ticks and ties to like, okay Monday
[00:16:40.770] I'll eat this Tuesday. I'll eat that it's so much easier to do that
[00:16:44.410] And I was like, I can't trust evening me. I can only trust like Sunday me, you know
[00:16:51.210] Like after work us is just a different different breed. I
[00:16:56.570] Know I think same goes for like morning me sometimes too
[00:17:00.850] Outfits for example, I noticed that if I don't set out an outfit even if it's just like something really simple nothing crazy, right?
[00:17:08.450] But if I don't set out like a workday outfit the night before in the morning, it'll take me like twice as long to pick
[00:17:14.570] Even though I'll still probably pick the same outfit
[00:17:17.290] Do sometimes when that happens and I'm in a rush. I'm like fuck. I'm just gonna wear all black today
[00:17:25.610] It's kind of like that saying right where people say like you can't you can't grocery shop when you're hungry
[00:17:31.690] You can't shop with an empty stomach, right? Right and I feel like that's so true
[00:17:36.250] I think that happens a lot, especially if you're like door dashing something or you know ordering something and you're like, oh, I'm hella hungry
[00:17:44.210] Let me just you know order, you know this this extra side that sounds hella good right now
[00:17:48.930] Then it comes you're like wait, I can only a half of this food
[00:17:53.970] You're like who let me order all that
[00:17:56.450] And then the worst part is when like the food arrives your delivery person put like two sets of utensils in there and you're like
[00:18:04.170] Oh
[00:18:05.690] Yeah, they were right and I was wrong
[00:18:09.530] This is like why I think
[00:18:11.850] All the hot tips about decision-making come in in your late 20s
[00:18:16.790] Because I have let myself down many a times with poor decision-making
[00:18:21.530] Agreed. I am also
[00:18:23.330] Although speaking of food, I remember you mentioned before that like at work
[00:18:27.970] Sometimes you have to choose the meal for your team
[00:18:30.730] What you've started doing is you narrow it down to like two or three decisions and then you make everyone else
[00:18:37.010] Kind of vote or like make the final decision and I feel like that is such a good
[00:18:42.450] Middle ground that way you can save yourself from like making the final most stressful
[00:18:48.570] Part of the decision and you also get everyone else involved, dude
[00:18:53.010] I've been like musing about that recently though because I think the specific scenario that I mentioned that one time is in
[00:18:59.970] Workplace like corkers going out for lunch kind of setting but this kind of stuff happens with friends, too
[00:19:05.850] whether it's one-on-one or in friend groups and I feel like because we're all just so
[00:19:11.810] Labored with making decisions from nine to five like for a company every day
[00:19:16.690] I feel like not a lot of people want to do the decision-making anymore
[00:19:20.330] And I realized that sometimes it is just kind of easier to be like I want to try this place
[00:19:25.770] does it sound good instead of like doing the back-and-forth because
[00:19:29.370] That way if they don't want to eat it, they'll just be like, ah, maybe not
[00:19:33.770] I'm feeling this place if as long as they're comfortable saying that kind of stuff
[00:19:37.410] Mm-hmm
[00:19:37.930] And if they don't really care then you like chose something for them and then now they can just go there
[00:19:43.370] So, I don't know
[00:19:44.290] I feel like you have to know your audience because I've had both strategies like not work
[00:19:49.930] Depending on the person dang
[00:19:51.610] Have you ever offered a few things and then someone's just like I don't want any of that. I
[00:19:57.890] Feel usually it's like oh they all look good. Oh, like what do you want to eat?
[00:20:02.450] And I'm like, oh I already sent you the three places that I want to eat out. You should pick
[00:20:08.410] But I think it's just you know
[00:20:10.090] It comes with having people around you who are super nice and like they want you to feel comfortable and whatever
[00:20:15.690] They're like, yeah, you just choose
[00:20:18.450] Except you're like, I don't want to choose that's like the most painful sentence to hear. I know
[00:20:24.610] Oh, but also like speaking of crowdsourcing decisions one funny thing that happens in our group chat
[00:20:31.250] Sometimes is someone will be like hey, what should I eat tonight or like what should I cook tonight?
[00:20:37.090] If people actually seriously respond. Yeah, it's so funny
[00:20:41.050] The funny ones are like hey guys, should I eat Chipotle tonight and then it's like resounding yes from everyone
[00:20:48.170] Dude, I know that shit is hella funny
[00:20:50.170] I'm in this other group chat too
[00:20:51.610] And sometimes if I really can't make a decision
[00:20:53.610] I'll make like a poll and this group chat is only two other people so it's hella funny because I'll just make a poll and
[00:20:58.890] Be like should I eat a brownie or should I not?
[00:21:02.610] We were back on the brownie
[00:21:07.050] You talked about brownies in the honeymoon
[00:21:13.770] Things in my brain
[00:21:18.690] Next time I see you I'll bring some brownies
[00:21:24.890] Wait, but also if the group chat is only three people does that ever mean that you have to tie break for your own decision?
[00:21:33.490] Dude yeah, I'm always like this is so useless
[00:21:37.290] To make a poll in a group chat of three people and you are the third person
[00:21:42.950] Back to square one. Oh my god. Wait, but also I think it's funny when there's like a poll made for a group
[00:21:50.430] But then everyone's waiting for the first person to make like the first decision and then they're like, okay now I can put in my vote
[00:21:57.910] Oh my god, or when it's like, oh we should hang out
[00:22:01.590] What weekend is everyone free and then the votes exactly split like half-half and it's just like okay
[00:22:08.750] Now I have to choose which group of people that I want to hang out like now it's actually worse because I have the knowledge
[00:22:16.030] the info
[00:22:18.830] Ignorance is bliss
[00:22:20.470] True, they should really create a way to outsource this like date choosing
[00:22:25.710] Maybe even just a site where it's like hey, I want to have an event in May. Can you give me a random weekend?
[00:22:31.790] Dude but speaking of RNG and like flipping a coin and stuff like that for
[00:22:38.150] Miami when we went to do our joint bachelor and bachelorette
[00:22:41.230] James and I thought that it would be hella funny to make a coin where one side says James and one side says Jisoo
[00:22:46.670] So sometimes we actually use it if we're like, oh I want wing stop, but he wants Chipotle
[00:22:51.890] Well, like flip the coin and see oh my god. That's genius
[00:22:56.390] Do you ever reroll or reflip?
[00:22:59.550] I'm like, I don't like this result
[00:23:02.550] You're like best out of five
[00:23:04.910] Dude, yeah, James is like very much. Okay. No, fuck this like best of X. Oh, we just keep rolling
[00:23:11.110] And the next thing you know, it's 10 p.m. You're like, oh they're both closed
[00:23:15.830] Time to sleep the crystal method
[00:23:19.350] But honestly the crowdsourcing thing I
[00:23:22.270] Sometimes do wonder if it is a result of people just having decision-making fatigue now because I've been noticing it
[00:23:28.630] Slightly more often. I think it does allude to the fact that
[00:23:33.070] Decision-making is hard
[00:23:35.590] It was definitely hard for different reasons for everyone
[00:23:38.350] So I guess what do you think is the hardest for you about making a decision?
[00:23:42.790] Honestly, I think lately what I've really been noticing is like there's too many options in
[00:23:50.070] Everything in life, right? So food
[00:23:52.770] There's like so many different restaurants around us that we have access to or like even shopping, you know
[00:24:00.930] Before maybe there was one company that did one thing
[00:24:04.930] For example this one company sold webcams and they're like good
[00:24:09.450] but now it's like there's so many if you just do a quick search you get like pages and pages of
[00:24:16.730] Basically the same product at varying price ranges and then you're just like oh my god, like what do I do?
[00:24:23.890] how do I know which one's good and which ones like vetted or not vetted or
[00:24:29.010] If this really cheap one will work out
[00:24:31.690] well
[00:24:31.970] or if I just like drop the extra money to get this like more expensive one and I feel like
[00:24:38.130] All of that is just like I don't know. I guess it's like kinda, you know, the result of a capitalist
[00:24:45.370] Society
[00:24:47.810] So we end up just with like hella options and then that results in a lot of decision paralysis
[00:24:54.130] That's a really good point. What I've been noticing lately, too is I don't know if it's just the way
[00:25:01.250] the tick-tock algorithm works or
[00:25:04.010] Just how we've evolved as a society under like all these different
[00:25:09.250] Options that look so shiny and new to us, but I feel like every time I'm scrolling down tick-tock there's like oh
[00:25:15.410] Here's what you're doing wrong about credit card points
[00:25:18.370] Like here's what you're doing wrong about booking this flight and like there's all these secret tips and tricks because there's so much
[00:25:25.370] Information out there and now I feel like I can't make a decision as easy as like what credit card should I open or like?
[00:25:32.590] When should I book this flight?
[00:25:34.290] Because everyone left and right is claiming that they have like the hot new tech and I feel like it gives you like
[00:25:42.250] Almost like a sense of FOMO, you know because before back in my parents days
[00:25:47.090] I'm sure they also had tips and tricks and stuff
[00:25:49.530] But it was probably kind of like if you know, you know, but if not, no one's gonna be like
[00:25:53.550] Oh, why'd you get that thing or like? Why'd you book that one?
[00:25:57.130] Well, I think it's more just like oh, you know, the default is that everyone does it the standard way
[00:26:01.490] Maybe some people know it the other way. But now I'm just kind of like there's too much information out there and
[00:26:06.850] The way it's being presented is like in a almost judgmental manner
[00:26:11.730] That also makes me not want to like decide anything
[00:26:14.850] Yeah, it's kind of like what we said earlier where we ask everyone like hey, which weekend are you free?
[00:26:20.450] And then we're like, oh shoot now
[00:26:22.410] I have too much information because now the decision-making feels bad because I know I'm gonna exclude someone it's almost like that right
[00:26:29.130] It's like oh shoot now. I have so much information. It's actually harder to make the decision
[00:26:34.490] Yeah, that's definitely true. I feel like it's also intimidating too
[00:26:38.490] You're like faced with this plethora of info and it's like I'm very grateful to have this
[00:26:44.850] Accessible but at the same time it's like I have to comb through all of this after
[00:26:50.210] Spending energy and time to learn it all then I have to make another decision
[00:26:55.470] I know and I feel like also with social media and just you know, not everyone posts often on Instagram stories or whatever
[00:27:02.690] But I feel like a lot of people do post on the daily
[00:27:05.030] I feel like you just see so much of what someone does every day
[00:27:09.550] Even if you're not the type of person to let it affect you like I feel like you still kind of think about it
[00:27:13.890] Sometimes and it just feels like my brain is being like overloaded all the time
[00:27:18.870] Yeah, and I feel like that just results in feelings of being overwhelmed
[00:27:24.070] Personally if I'm overwhelmed whether I realize it or not, I just end up like lying in bed. I know
[00:27:30.350] I think I feel like the hardest to when say on one day
[00:27:33.870] I have multiple important tasks to do and all of them are like at least in my eyes weighted equally
[00:27:39.630] I feel like I just can't choose which one to do first
[00:27:44.870] Mm-hmm, and then that means I just don't do any of them dude
[00:27:48.150] Yeah, as people say the hardest part is to start true
[00:27:52.030] I actually saw this one like I think it was a tick-tock and it's not quite like decision-making
[00:27:58.350] But it kind of reminds me of what we've been talking about
[00:28:01.990] Basically, the woman was saying like I'm tired of always getting ready for stuff
[00:28:07.390] She listed out like a bunch of things that we get ready for that
[00:28:11.270] I like didn't even realize we get ready for so she was saying like I have to you know
[00:28:16.110] Wake up and get ready for the day
[00:28:17.950] so, you know like wash your face brush your teeth put on your face all that kind of stuff and then like get ready to
[00:28:24.150] Like go to the office
[00:28:26.430] Packing up all your stuff get ready to eat lunch
[00:28:29.030] You know
[00:28:29.390] You have to like pack your lunch if you do that or make the decision of like where to go eat
[00:28:33.990] Get ready to like just leave the house is like a whole thing in itself to like making sure you have everything
[00:28:40.950] And then the one that like shook me to my core was
[00:28:44.990] Getting ready for bed like you have to get ready to go to bed, right?
[00:28:50.110] That's crazy, right? How much of our daily life is just transition timing like we're waiting to do something else
[00:28:56.750] Yeah, and it's all just like in a sense. It's kind of like decision-making
[00:29:00.910] It's like oh if I'm gonna make the decision to like leave the house
[00:29:04.110] I have to get ready to do that and it's like kind of
[00:29:06.830] tied to what we were talking about early like planning to like get this thing done and
[00:29:11.350] Then kind of also thinking about what comes after that too. I'm like, whoa we do a lot. I
[00:29:17.590] Think another theory that I have is I guess even using something like a smartphone
[00:29:23.390] You're just making so many decisions constantly and I've been noticing this lately and it's starting to freak me out a little bit because I feel
[00:29:30.390] Like I'm truly having a phone addiction moment
[00:29:33.630] But sometimes I will unlock my phone and then mindlessly open and close each app
[00:29:40.830] Like, you know how you like it wake up in the morning
[00:29:43.170] You're like, okay check mail
[00:29:44.550] Look at your text look at your messenger and then scroll through tick-tock a little bit and get up or whatever
[00:29:49.270] Like there's some sort of routine, right? I noticed that sometimes if I'm really like brain off
[00:29:54.230] I'll be looping through it
[00:29:55.750] So like I'll open mail again or like I'll open tick-tock close it and be like, oh look at something else
[00:30:00.550] Look at that and I go back to tick-tock and I'm like wait
[00:30:02.990] I was just on the inside and even though these things are like split second decision making and it's like
[00:30:08.910] Probably more so muscle memory that it is like active decision-making
[00:30:12.470] I feel like maybe your brain would probably count that as like a half-seas decision or something
[00:30:17.430] And maybe that's why at 5 p.m. I'm like, I can't choose what to eat
[00:30:23.270] I've definitely felt that too when you're just like autopiloting and you're like wait
[00:30:27.350] I need to go do something and then you're like, okay, let me get up and they're like, oh wait
[00:30:32.110] Why am I back here on my phone? Right?
[00:30:34.910] Well besides these more difficult moments of decision-making and I guess like finding activation energy
[00:30:42.110] Is there anything that you know for sure is like a quick and easy decision for you?
[00:30:53.820] What about like liking a video whoa, do you like videos no
[00:31:00.940] I guess that decision is easy. Oh you don't like videos, too
[00:31:06.780] wait, that's so cool because one time I
[00:31:09.020] Saw someone scrolling through like reels or tik-tok or something and they're like scroll double tap scroll scroll double tap
[00:31:15.340] And I was like, well you like videos and then they're like, oh you don't I was like no it's like against my
[00:31:23.300] values I
[00:31:26.380] Just cannot if I accidentally hit like I will unlike and then if I'm like scrolling through the comments and I accidentally like
[00:31:33.460] Thumbs up or thumbs down someone's comment
[00:31:36.220] I will immediately fix that to back to neutral like same with reddit for example or like YouTube
[00:31:42.460] Like I never like videos or comments or anything like that. If I do I like immediately undo it. Oh
[00:31:50.940] Okay, I think that's actually very similar to James he has like a zero like policy if you go on his profile
[00:31:57.380] He wants to make sure that it says zero under like liked videos, but for me, I'm more flexible
[00:32:02.620] But it's very rare that I'll like stuff like I'll only give it to the people who really did it
[00:32:07.340] I'm like, this is so fucking fire. Like you deserve a like
[00:32:11.660] So that is a decision you make I guess that's true and it feels more intuitive
[00:32:17.460] Maybe because it feels light-hearted and not
[00:32:20.260] any substance or consequence
[00:32:23.340] Associated I guess the other thing but I do find easy to make in terms of decisions is with social
[00:32:31.100] Situations I think for the most part if someone is visiting from out of town
[00:32:35.460] Who wants to catch up or you're just like seeing someone you haven't seen in a long time, etc
[00:32:39.500] I think I'm always more than happy to do that
[00:32:41.780] The only difficult part about that era of decision-making is the scheduling aspect
[00:32:47.540] But I feel like in terms of wanting to go and see that person. My mind is always down
[00:32:51.820] I'm always like yay nice. I think a quick and easy decision for me is if I'm craving something
[00:32:59.580] Food bias if I know I like really want to eat something
[00:33:03.260] I will make it a mission to do it to succeed
[00:33:07.140] I feel like similarly to if I have a recipe I really want to try out
[00:33:12.340] I'm like, I will go and get this and like make this this weekend something like that. Yeah, I guess like
[00:33:19.460] the thing about like these easier or quick decisions for me is like the
[00:33:25.380] Gain is so high
[00:33:27.660] That the loss is like negligible so I guess that you know, for example, like if you're craving a certain food, it's like, okay
[00:33:34.300] well, I have to like get ready to get out, but honestly, that's nothing in comparison to like the satisfaction of like, you know,
[00:33:41.860] Satisfying that craving right? And I think this can kind of be applied to other areas in life, too
[00:33:49.260] But maybe not as like
[00:33:51.740] Obviously, but I think at work on average
[00:33:54.420] I'm like not a huge decision maker one because I am on like the lower end of the
[00:34:02.380] Management chain. So usually I don't really have to make that many decisions in terms of I don't know
[00:34:07.580] I guess like managing or like time managing that kind of stuff other than for like literally just myself
[00:34:13.820] But what I've started to kind of realize is that if you step up and like take control
[00:34:20.220] I guess of a meeting for example, it's actually very empowering
[00:34:24.980] You have a lot to gain from it
[00:34:26.940] So as an example, I had this like meeting for a check-in for a project that I was working on
[00:34:32.940] It's like a really big project. So it's taking kind of a long time and I was like, oh shoot this meeting low-key is like
[00:34:39.940] Too early so I moved it and I just said like hey
[00:34:43.660] I need just an extra day to like get this state that I think is ready to show you all
[00:34:48.560] And there's like no complaints like okay cool and then when the actual meeting came up to I think in my personal mind
[00:34:55.520] I was like, oh shoot
[00:34:56.280] This isn't as like I guess quote-unquote perfect as I would want it to be
[00:35:01.160] So I made the decision to basically like take control of the meeting
[00:35:05.920] So I would like open up the meeting by saying like oh, you know, I've been kind of busy
[00:35:09.960] so some of these parts are like a little more rough around the edges, but this should be able to give us all like
[00:35:15.720] a good idea of
[00:35:17.480] what the next step will look like and then I have like these three points for us to look through and discuss and
[00:35:23.500] I think like before that meeting I had felt a lot of anxiety
[00:35:28.060] Because I guess a side of me didn't think what I was showing was like as good as it could be
[00:35:34.920] But after like taking control in that meeting
[00:35:38.540] Everything just went so smoothly and I was like wait, why was I nervous about this? Like everything was totally fine
[00:35:44.240] But I love that I think you're totally right in that sometimes it feels so much more scary to make the decision
[00:35:51.160] but once you do there's just a net positive and
[00:35:55.400] The scary part about that is that it's never like a guarantee that it'll be positive
[00:36:00.040] but sometimes I think about how on the daily especially in a workplace setting you are subject to
[00:36:06.320] Everyone else's decisions that they're making on the daily and I feel like when I see an email come through that's like hey, sorry
[00:36:13.080] I need to push this meeting out due to schedule conflict, whatever. I'm never like really thinking that deep into it
[00:36:18.800] I'm like, oh, yeah sure. It makes sense
[00:36:20.120] I can make this time but for some reason when I'm the one who has to reschedule I'm like trembling hands
[00:36:25.240] I'm like damn. Hopefully this doesn't negatively impact someone too much, etc
[00:36:29.440] I think it's one of those things where I'm so used to and taking other people's decisions
[00:36:34.000] And then when it comes to making my own decisions
[00:36:36.400] I have to give myself that same level of grace that I give other people
[00:36:39.840] True and usually I think there's a level of understanding like don't reschedule a meeting like 10 minutes before
[00:36:46.480] Ideally, but you know basically like showing that you have control over what is happening
[00:36:52.600] I think puts everyone else at ease even if you're just like making it up
[00:36:56.640] So, you know, I think fake it till you make it is very true in this instance
[00:37:00.840] You're just like hey, you know this had to be moved. There's like no other option
[00:37:05.020] It's highly unlikely that people are gonna be like no unless you like
[00:37:09.360] disregarded other people's schedule and timing by like moving the meeting to some time that they couldn't make or
[00:37:16.740] Changing the meeting super last-minute that kind of stuff
[00:37:19.500] So I feel like if anything it's like a relief for other people when you make decisions
[00:37:24.740] Yeah, and I feel like the workplace is a really good environment to see how your
[00:37:29.540] Decisions affect other people and things like that because I think at the end of the day
[00:37:33.740] That's like such a big part of why decision-making can be hard
[00:37:36.980] I feel like making a decision that just impacts you feels a little bit more inconsequential
[00:37:41.700] But when it comes to making a decision that loops in a lot of other people besides just yourself
[00:37:46.540] I feel like that's when the pressure starts to feel a little bit more real
[00:37:50.540] Whether it's something as petty as oh, where should we eat lunch together?
[00:37:55.540] Or lunch or sometimes it it truly is bigger decisions that affect other people's lives and I feel like this is also really
[00:38:03.220] evident in like smaller groups, so for example, like
[00:38:07.180] Your immediate family or if you're in a relationship if one person is always making the decisions
[00:38:13.900] There's bound to be some like friction there
[00:38:16.660] I think right for sure cuz I mean decision-making is emotional labor, right? Like there's a lot of
[00:38:23.540] Optimizing and like minimizing this and maximizing that that you have to do before you do the decision
[00:38:29.620] I mean granted not every decision is that deep and not everyone gives each decision that much thought
[00:38:35.300] But it still is something that you have to action and choose for the group
[00:38:41.220] So then I can totally see I mean the easiest example is if in a friend group
[00:38:45.900] It's always just one person asking to hang out
[00:38:48.780] I feel like that makes someone burnt out so quickly and
[00:38:52.900] Similarly in a relationship if one person is always getting tasked with making the decision
[00:38:57.460] I feel like it can definitely lead to resentment down the road
[00:39:01.660] yeah, definitely and I think a big lesson that I've learned as we've gotten more and more sentient as
[00:39:09.580] As real people is that you can't always be a follower
[00:39:14.460] You there are like moments where you definitely need to step up and I think
[00:39:20.220] Interestingly, I feel like there is a way to be neutral
[00:39:23.700] but I feel like you can't word things in a follower manner and
[00:39:28.780] The specific thing I'm thinking about is like, you know the age-old question of oh, what should we eat tonight?
[00:39:35.140] I feel like what should we eat tonight is fairly neutral
[00:39:38.420] But you can word that same question into what do you want to eat for dinner?
[00:39:42.180] And then I feel like it becomes very follower ask and kind of like putting that load on that other person
[00:39:48.420] So it's really subtle in terms of like word choice
[00:39:51.620] But I feel like if you hear oh, what do you want to eat for dinner?
[00:39:54.380] Like over and over and over again. I feel like it does kind of drive you crazy a little bit
[00:39:58.380] Oh, yeah, you're like, oh, why is it always me deciding? Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck do you want to eat for dinner?
[00:40:03.980] You're like, why are we always eating what I want to eat? What about you? Do you have any opinions?
[00:40:09.020] It's so funny too because I feel like surface level it's like harmless
[00:40:14.380] Yeah, and I mean it is really harmless and you can even frame it as oh this person is so considerate
[00:40:19.860] Like they always want to know what I want to eat
[00:40:21.700] But you know in the active adult world, I feel like it does become a burden that you have to carry
[00:40:27.820] Yeah for sure and it's kind of like you said right? It's a totally harmless phrase
[00:40:32.380] But if you were to hear it repeatedly you start to notice it. You're like, hmm
[00:40:38.340] That is yet another decision you have to make how to word
[00:40:42.260] your question to the other person I
[00:40:47.020] Guess we are just doomed to continuously make decisions for the rest of our lives
[00:40:56.580] But I do think it's always helpful to have other people
[00:41:00.140] Weigh in a little bit in any way that they can to lighten the load of these decisions
[00:41:05.820] So I feel like it was pretty interesting to talk about like the different
[00:41:09.660] Areas in life that have a lot of heavy decision-making that we experienced
