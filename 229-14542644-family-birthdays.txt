[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast.
[00:00:02.200] I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:16.870] All right.
[00:00:17.270] So before we get started today as usual, we have a word but
[00:00:21.770] we're actually bringing it back to millennial slang.
[00:00:25.870] I think this is millennial slang, right?
[00:00:27.670] Yeah, I would agree because it originated with our generation.
[00:00:31.670] The word is giga chad.
[00:00:34.370] I think this word is hella funny, but it also kind of has
[00:00:38.970] even more history than you realize.
[00:00:41.970] I think it's an evolved form of Chad.
[00:00:44.670] Chad kind of came up somehow as the ultimate alpha male,
[00:00:49.770] I guess.
[00:00:50.570] I remember the memes that I originally saw for being a Chad
[00:00:54.270] was basically, you know, that like meme of the blonde guy
[00:00:57.470] who's like super buff, right?
[00:00:59.170] And then it's like this dude does whatever successful thing.
[00:01:02.670] The opposite to it.
[00:01:04.070] It shows like the sad Shiva dog and it's like this one like,
[00:01:08.070] you know, didn't succeed or something.
[00:01:10.370] I feel like the thing I know too is the Chad who is always
[00:01:13.670] successful does whatever and then the virgin is like the one
[00:01:17.270] who's not successful.
[00:01:18.470] So I just remember that spectrum of the Chad and the virgin.
[00:01:22.070] Yeah, so that has evolved into giga chad.
[00:01:26.070] So pretty self-explanatory that it's just a Chad except like
[00:01:31.770] giga, a major Chad if you will.
[00:01:36.670] The ultimate Chad.
[00:01:38.270] Yeah, the ultimate Chad.
[00:01:39.870] I feel like this meme is also funny because the way I first
[00:01:43.170] heard about this term is through that one photo.
[00:01:45.870] I guess people who know this term might think of that black
[00:01:49.470] and white photo of a guy with like the ultimate jawline.
[00:01:53.670] It's super defined.
[00:01:54.770] His whole body is sculpted.
[00:01:56.170] You could see like every vein on it pretty much because he's
[00:01:58.970] so buff and I remember seeing a photo of that and seeing the
[00:02:02.070] caption.
[00:02:02.570] Oh, this guy is giga Chad because not only is he a Chad he's
[00:02:06.970] so buff and so alpha looking that he's the giga Chad but it's
[00:02:11.970] funny because I feel like the meme at least the way that I
[00:02:15.670] have incorporated it into my vocabulary is it's no longer associated
[00:02:20.470] with the picture for me now.
[00:02:21.870] It's just like when someone is super successful.
[00:02:24.370] I just immediately think oh this person is a giga Chad.
[00:02:28.470] Do you remember when the last time you might have said giga
[00:02:31.770] Chad was? I don't I say it so often.
[00:02:36.370] I don't use it that often.
[00:02:37.870] So I'm like trying to think if there was a time when I used
[00:02:40.870] it recently, but I can't quite think of one but to kind of
[00:02:44.770] go back to the Chad stuff Chad if you want to know the origin
[00:02:48.870] of it way back in 2015 someone posted in a bodybuilding forum
[00:02:54.870] apparently he submitted a post that said going on tinder as
[00:03:00.270] Chad Thundercock is beyond depressing and it shows his profile
[00:03:05.070] because his name was like legitimately Chad Thundercock.
[00:03:09.970] No way and then I think that's how it kind of blew up because
[00:03:14.370] then someone on tumblr made a Chad Thundercock tumblr and was
[00:03:18.370] like dude this fucking name right according to know your meme.
[00:03:22.370] That's how Chad kind of blew up and became a thing.
[00:03:25.670] Holy shit.
[00:03:26.670] That's so funny.
[00:03:28.270] Yeah, Chad Thundercock is a tough name to live up to it also
[00:03:32.870] says on this know your meme page that the female counterpart
[00:03:36.770] for the term Chad is Stacy.
[00:03:39.870] Oh, you know that kind of makes sense.
[00:03:42.370] I think Stacy is sort of like a Chad esque name interesting
[00:03:46.470] interesting Stacy that just reminds me of like the song Stacy's
[00:03:51.170] mom.
[00:03:53.170] I guess it's like a more casual way to say the alpha and the
[00:03:56.470] beta like the Chad Thundercock and the virgin no last name.
[00:04:04.570] I feel like this is just one of the most applicable slang terms
[00:04:08.370] giga Chad highly recommend this because it's so like it requires
[00:04:12.870] no explanation.
[00:04:14.070] Like I feel like even if you have never heard the term giga
[00:04:16.370] Chad as soon as you hear it in a sentence, you're just like
[00:04:18.870] yeah, that makes total sense.
[00:04:21.870] Yeah, and I feel like it can be for any basic thing that no
[00:04:25.270] one else wants to do like, you know, maybe someone steps up
[00:04:29.070] and like gets the restaurant reservation.
[00:04:32.170] That's like kind of hard to get then you're like damn.
[00:04:34.070] You're such a giga Chad.
[00:04:36.270] True or when you hear about someone who's like just doing
[00:04:39.470] very well for themselves and you maybe haven't heard of that
[00:04:41.970] person in a while.
[00:04:42.970] You're just like, oh my God like he did this and now he works
[00:04:45.970] here and he makes X number of dollars like that guy is such
[00:04:49.370] a giga Chad.
[00:04:51.370] Yeah, it's a funny praise.
[00:04:53.570] I think and it's very light-hearted to if anything it'll make
[00:04:58.470] everyone around you laugh while also making the person who's
[00:05:02.870] being called a giga Chad feel a little good.
[00:05:06.170] That's true.
[00:05:06.570] So it's like a friendly slang term at least the way that we
[00:05:11.070] use it.
[00:05:11.470] I think it's the ultimate high praise.
[00:05:13.970] Also, I think the photos are so funny.
[00:05:16.370] If our listeners haven't seen the giga Chad photos, it's super
[00:05:20.070] funny. It always reminds me of you know, fairly odd parents
[00:05:23.470] like Crimson Chin.
[00:05:24.670] Oh true.
[00:05:27.370] I never made that connection but that's very accurate actually
[00:05:30.570] giant chin.
[00:05:32.070] Yeah, the giga Chad photo is truly you'll see the image once
[00:05:35.470] and it'll be forever tattooed onto your brain like you would
[00:05:38.070] never forget this photo.
[00:05:39.670] Yeah, such a funny photo.
[00:05:42.570] Well speaking of other things that are forever tattooed onto
[00:05:46.170] our brains.
[00:05:47.870] A little bit of a rough transition here today.
[00:05:50.770] We wanted to talk about family birthdays.
[00:05:53.370] I think these are something that you also hopefully never
[00:05:56.170] forget and it's something that comes up every year and I
[00:05:59.470] actually feel like this is a very interesting topic because
[00:06:01.870] each family does birthdays very differently and we kind of
[00:06:07.070] talked about this before starting the recording.
[00:06:09.470] I think depending on how your family approaches birthdays,
[00:06:12.670] I feel like it definitely affects the way that you approach
[00:06:15.470] birthdays in your life in your adulthood as well.
[00:06:18.470] So let's kind of kick this off by going back into our childhood
[00:06:22.670] and thinking about how did you and your family do birthdays?
[00:06:27.270] Oh my god.
[00:06:27.970] So back in the day, I remember pretty clearly that sometimes
[00:06:32.970] I would do my birthday at McDonald's.
[00:06:35.470] Whoa.
[00:06:36.670] I don't know if it was a thing here but it was kind of a thing
[00:06:39.570] back where I lived.
[00:06:40.870] We would go to McDonald's and it was you know back when
[00:06:43.470] McDonald's still had the like playground areas.
[00:06:47.070] So we would get a few tables and I think it was also good
[00:06:50.870] because McDonald's is relatively cheap.
[00:06:53.770] At least, you know, it still was back in the day and all the
[00:06:56.870] kids are happy, you know, we're eating our happy meals and
[00:07:00.070] I think McDonald's used to do something kind of nice.
[00:07:03.670] Like I think they put up a little banner for you or something
[00:07:06.170] like that and then we got cake.
[00:07:08.570] It was like a relatively easy birthday party and it still
[00:07:12.970] felt special because it's like you're going somewhere and
[00:07:15.770] I think it was easy on the parents wallets for the most part.
[00:07:18.970] Right.
[00:07:19.470] There's things to keep the kids occupied, the like playground
[00:07:22.670] area thing.
[00:07:23.870] So I remember doing that at least like once or twice when
[00:07:27.970] I was kindergarten-ish.
[00:07:30.270] Yeah.
[00:07:31.170] Do you remember if you guys invited a bunch of your school
[00:07:34.770] friends or maybe your family friends or was it just you and
[00:07:37.770] your nuclear family?
[00:07:39.170] It was like a bunch of my school friends and then like my
[00:07:42.670] parents were there.
[00:07:43.670] I think, I mean they should be.
[00:07:46.270] That's a nice one actually and I feel like that also speaks
[00:07:48.770] to what feels very special when you're younger.
[00:07:51.470] I feel like there's so much more that's like commodified
[00:07:54.170] now to where birthdays, especially looking at how celebrities
[00:07:58.170] do their kids birthdays have become this like huge thing.
[00:08:00.570] But back then it truly was kind of like, oh, let's go to
[00:08:03.270] like the jungle gym nearby or like let's go to this fast
[00:08:06.570] food restaurant and it was like just as special if not even
[00:08:09.170] more meaningful.
[00:08:10.470] Yeah, I think there might have also been a couple times
[00:08:14.370] where it was just at our home and then we invited like a
[00:08:18.270] couple of our neighbors slash friends over just like ate
[00:08:22.370] cake together and then like played outside.
[00:08:24.770] So it's like overall like pretty simple stuff.
[00:08:28.470] Damn, this is like taking me back.
[00:08:30.870] The birthdays that I remember from when I was really young,
[00:08:33.570] one of them was my iconic second grade birthday party.
[00:08:37.570] My parents actually rented like a bouncy house, a jump house.
[00:08:41.370] Is that what it was called?
[00:08:42.470] We had it like inflated up in our front yard and at the
[00:08:45.770] time I think we lived in like a corner house.
[00:08:48.670] So then a couple of the neighbors kids came by and then
[00:08:51.770] a bunch of my school friends came and we like jumped in
[00:08:54.770] the jump house for a little bit and then we had pizza at
[00:08:58.170] like a little table set up in our garage and it was just
[00:09:00.470] like this gorgeous sunny day and I think we had some sort
[00:09:02.570] of you know, like one of those kiddie pools set up in our
[00:09:05.270] backyard as well.
[00:09:06.370] So it was super fun and actually a couple years ago, I
[00:09:10.270] was looking back at like old childhood photos at my parents
[00:09:13.170] place and I guess my parents had borrowed a bunch of hanboks
[00:09:17.370] like kid hanboks for us.
[00:09:19.170] So there's like photos of us all in little hanboks and
[00:09:22.170] whatnot and of course a bunch of them were not Korean.
[00:09:24.770] So I think it was like more special and more fun.
[00:09:27.270] That sounds so cute.
[00:09:28.670] Dude, a bunch of little kids running around in hanboks.
[00:09:32.470] And I think another year we did just a normal kind of like
[00:09:36.170] at home party and then some of the closer like family
[00:09:39.670] friends slept over and actually that's one of the first
[00:09:43.370] times where I really remember thinking, oh so my school
[00:09:46.770] friends are here and some of my family friends are here
[00:09:49.670] and we're like mixing friend groups.
[00:09:51.670] So I wonder if it's going to be weird.
[00:09:54.270] Whoa, just crazy.
[00:09:55.270] First time.
[00:09:56.570] Yeah, because I remember this was probably whoa.
[00:10:01.370] Actually, I wonder if this is the same second grade birthday
[00:10:04.370] party because the house that we lived in was before we had
[00:10:08.570] moved into where I was living for third grade.
[00:10:11.570] So this could have been the same birthday party, but I
[00:10:13.870] remember being like whoa, are they going to get along or
[00:10:16.770] whatever which is crazy to think that I was like seven years
[00:10:19.970] old thinking these thoughts.
[00:10:20.870] Oh my god.
[00:10:22.070] And you continued to think them into adulthood.
[00:10:25.170] Yeah, actually.
[00:10:27.370] That's when it started.
[00:10:28.570] That's your origin story.
[00:10:30.170] Dude, when the anxiety begins.
[00:10:33.970] Do you have any other memorable birthdays you can think of?
[00:10:37.470] I do but I was older in these times, but do you ever remember
[00:10:42.970] going to other kids birthday parties and thinking damn this
[00:10:45.870] is so different.
[00:10:47.270] Oh, oh my god.
[00:10:49.470] Wait.
[00:10:50.870] I don't know at least in my memory.
[00:10:53.670] I remember one of my friends dude.
[00:10:57.070] I honestly can't even remember who this was but someone did
[00:11:00.070] a Chuck E. Cheese birthday party and then one year someone
[00:11:03.370] did like a Dave & Buster's birthday party.
[00:11:06.270] Dave & Buster's?
[00:11:07.370] How old were they?
[00:11:08.070] Maybe that was more like in middle school.
[00:11:09.870] Okay, but another year someone did a birthday party at the
[00:11:13.470] jungle which is like a jungle gym.
[00:11:15.570] Oh, okay.
[00:11:15.870] And I remember all three times I was like, whoa, this is not
[00:11:18.670] what I would want for my own birthday party.
[00:11:22.470] I was like this is too much chaos.
[00:11:25.070] Oh my god.
[00:11:25.670] I feel like Dave & Buster's gets really rowdy.
[00:11:27.970] I've never been to a Chuck E.
[00:11:28.970] Cheese though.
[00:11:29.970] Whoa, really?
[00:11:31.070] Chuck E.
[00:11:31.470] Cheese is like a US only thing.
[00:11:33.970] And so by the time I was here we're kind of too old for it
[00:11:37.770] and I was like, what is this Chuck E.
[00:11:39.470] Cheese thing that I keep seeing?
[00:11:40.970] Remember they did so many TV ads and stuff.
[00:11:43.470] It's just like come here and eat pizza and play games.
[00:11:48.170] And I feel like it was such a cultural reference but really
[00:11:50.870] even in my childhood.
[00:11:51.770] I think I've only been like once or twice.
[00:11:54.870] And now it's like gone isn't it?
[00:11:56.370] Right.
[00:11:56.970] Out of business.
[00:11:58.070] It's kind of sad even though I've never been.
[00:12:01.270] But it's so iconic.
[00:12:02.270] I feel like.
[00:12:03.070] Yeah, I think I've gone to other kids who also did a McDonald's
[00:12:08.470] birthday before.
[00:12:10.070] Maybe it was something about our town because like the suburb
[00:12:13.670] area that we lived in was pretty small.
[00:12:17.070] So there weren't like a ton of options.
[00:12:19.470] And so there was definitely a couple of McDonald's birthdays.
[00:12:24.070] Maybe there was also like, you know going to the theaters
[00:12:27.770] sometimes they have the room that you get to eat your food
[00:12:31.570] in and then all the kids go to the theater after.
[00:12:34.270] I think I've attended something like that once or twice as
[00:12:37.370] well.
[00:12:38.370] I don't know.
[00:12:38.770] I think that's like all that I'm remembering from like, you
[00:12:41.970] know, elementary school and kindergarten era.
[00:12:45.070] Dude.
[00:12:45.770] Yeah, I think we also did kind of like the movie theater
[00:12:48.670] arcade and maybe like a movie and pizza in one of those like
[00:12:52.070] rooms that you can rent after as well.
[00:12:54.170] Yeah, and it's kind of interesting because now as adults
[00:12:58.270] I feel like whatever party we go to there's usually some
[00:13:01.370] sort of alcohol whether it's like wine or hard liquor or
[00:13:04.570] whatever.
[00:13:04.870] But back then it was truly like candy and soda.
[00:13:07.570] Dude.
[00:13:07.870] And I remember that shit like we would be hopped up on the
[00:13:11.570] fucking sugar.
[00:13:12.970] You know, I didn't think much about it as a child, but now
[00:13:15.370] I'm like, oh my god.
[00:13:16.570] Yeah, sugar drives children crazy.
[00:13:19.570] I remember in the beginning we would all be like let's play
[00:13:22.070] a game or two or whatever and then by the end we'd be like
[00:13:25.170] screaming, running around being absolute menaces.
[00:13:29.470] We actually like why are there so many screaming children
[00:13:33.170] because they're being fed candy.
[00:13:35.670] Oh my god.
[00:13:36.470] And to think at that time we didn't know like ourselves,
[00:13:40.270] you know, so we're like no this is just how I am but like
[00:13:43.470] actually we're just high on candy like our blood sugar was
[00:13:47.270] just out of control.
[00:13:48.770] Yeah.
[00:13:49.670] It's funny too because I guess depending on what kind of
[00:13:52.470] household you lived in what the like family diet was, you
[00:13:56.370] know, kids are more exposed to certain things based on their
[00:13:59.070] family culture.
[00:14:00.370] So my family didn't drink a ton of soda back then but like
[00:14:04.870] pizza and stuff was not like super uncommon like, you know,
[00:14:07.870] we would have it like I wasn't like restricted from it.
[00:14:10.670] Whereas other kids I felt like we're having soda every single
[00:14:13.270] day.
[00:14:13.470] So I feel like some kids got more high than others.
[00:14:16.670] Yeah, I remember like soda was banned in my home usually for
[00:14:23.170] kids but only like, you know, if we're going out and I don't
[00:14:26.670] know getting fast food or something then it's like, okay,
[00:14:28.770] you can have soda this one time but like we're gonna avoid
[00:14:31.670] that for the most part but my dad really liked soda.
[00:14:35.470] So I would always see him like drinking his Coke and I'm
[00:14:38.770] like dude like that looks so good.
[00:14:41.570] When can I drink soda?
[00:14:43.770] Actually now that you mention it.
[00:14:45.170] I do feel like there was sort of like an ease in process.
[00:14:48.370] I have like a vague recollection of only being able to drink
[00:14:51.170] Sprite for a long time and then Coke was like the adult drink
[00:14:54.770] and then like somewhere in the middle.
[00:14:55.870] It was like Fanta was okay or some shit.
[00:14:58.170] Oh, dude that sounds kind of familiar.
[00:15:01.270] Yeah, I think I drank Sprite more.
[00:15:03.870] It's probably because Coke has like some caffeine in it.
[00:15:06.870] Yeah, so they're probably like holy shit sugar plus caffeine
[00:15:10.170] like our kid is gonna go crazy.
[00:15:12.770] Yeah, what's also interesting too to me about going to other
[00:15:17.070] kids birthday parties is I remember even as a kid.
[00:15:21.970] I was like, oh this person throws like big birthday parties
[00:15:25.570] and every year they throw a birthday party.
[00:15:28.270] So one year in elementary school, I must have been like
[00:15:30.870] fourth or fifth grade.
[00:15:31.870] This one girl invited me to her birthday party and I thought
[00:15:35.070] it was kind of odd even at the time because I had like a
[00:15:38.370] couple of conversations like we weren't like close friends
[00:15:40.870] or anything.
[00:15:41.470] We just like chatted a couple times and she was like, oh you
[00:15:43.370] should come to my birthday party and she had it at a trampoline
[00:15:47.770] gym.
[00:15:48.870] It was someplace called Sky High.
[00:15:50.470] I think where the whole thing is like trampoline that just
[00:15:53.970] kind of like jump for like hours and you can like jump through
[00:15:56.970] rooms or whatever and I was like, whoa, this is like a different
[00:16:00.870] scale kind of a birthday party and another person that I knew
[00:16:04.670] through childhood.
[00:16:06.170] I always felt like his mom was very into throwing birthday
[00:16:09.270] parties.
[00:16:10.170] So every year he would do like a big birthday thing.
[00:16:13.270] But now that I think about it like looking back, I'm not actually
[00:16:15.970] sure if he's like a big birthday person.
[00:16:18.270] Like I just felt like his mom was very into throwing him
[00:16:20.370] birthday parties.
[00:16:21.470] She's like, oh my god, let's throw the best birthday party
[00:16:23.870] these five-year-olds could want.
[00:16:25.570] Yeah, and he's like, I'll show up I guess.
[00:16:29.470] She's like you're invited.
[00:16:30.970] So you better show up.
[00:16:32.970] But I feel like a trampoline.
[00:16:35.370] I don't know what to call them either like a trampoline house.
[00:16:38.770] Yeah, but I think I also might have gone to one for a birthday
[00:16:42.570] or something as well.
[00:16:44.570] I feel like that's a pretty good children's birthday spot because
[00:16:48.070] it's like, you know, if you fall you just fall into a trampoline
[00:16:51.670] and you get to jump around and use up all your energy.
[00:16:56.070] So the parents just get to watch and be like nice.
[00:16:58.770] They're gonna pass out on the way home.
[00:17:00.670] Dude, I have like this distinct memory.
[00:17:03.670] We were like jumping and like playing tag or whatever having
[00:17:06.470] fun like basically wreaking havoc in this trampoline gym and
[00:17:10.170] then we came out and all the moms were just like sitting on
[00:17:13.370] a bench making like very awkward and quiet small talk with
[00:17:16.570] each other and I remember thinking like, oh, why aren't they
[00:17:20.870] jumping?
[00:17:23.170] I was like, I wonder why they're just like sitting here.
[00:17:24.870] But now that I'm thinking about it, I was like a 28 year old.
[00:17:27.270] It's like there's only so much jumping you can do before you're
[00:17:29.870] just like I need to like sit down and have some water.
[00:17:32.370] Yeah.
[00:17:33.670] Oh my god, you know what?
[00:17:34.570] I think there was also like bowling.
[00:17:37.170] Oh, yeah, true.
[00:17:38.770] Bowling birthday parties.
[00:17:40.170] Yeah, pretty good.
[00:17:41.070] And I feel like that's a very 90s kids thing.
[00:17:44.770] Like I don't know if it happened as much after 2010 or whatever.
[00:17:50.370] Yeah, but you know early 2000s bowling parties pretty fun.
[00:17:54.470] It's true.
[00:17:55.270] Do you think all these like activities and stuff that we
[00:17:57.770] remember for our childhood birthday parties?
[00:18:00.270] Do you ever remember doing something like this for our parents
[00:18:03.070] birthdays?
[00:18:03.870] Dude, not at all.
[00:18:05.670] Yeah.
[00:18:06.270] So the thing is I didn't know my parents birthdays for the
[00:18:09.670] longest time.
[00:18:10.670] Wait, what?
[00:18:11.770] Yeah.
[00:18:12.470] So basically one I think they probably told me once or twice
[00:18:17.070] but my stupid child brain just kept forgetting it but we never
[00:18:21.370] made it a big deal.
[00:18:23.070] So I think what happened was I didn't ingrain it into my memory
[00:18:26.270] until later.
[00:18:27.470] So I would always just kind of forget but like my parents would
[00:18:30.070] remember each other's birthday, right?
[00:18:32.070] I think the most we would do is like we would just eat a cake.
[00:18:35.370] That's like kind of it like maybe get takeout or like go out
[00:18:38.870] to eat.
[00:18:39.770] It was just never a big deal.
[00:18:41.570] So then later when I got older, I was like dude, I'm such a bad
[00:18:45.770] child.
[00:18:46.370] Like how come I don't know their birthdays?
[00:18:49.070] So I started to like commit it to memory more.
[00:18:53.070] I think that started in high school probably.
[00:18:56.170] I was like dude, what is wrong with me?
[00:18:58.970] So do you think your parents made it a big deal for each other
[00:19:02.970] or they just like kind of secretly did it without making it
[00:19:06.270] a huge deal for the family?
[00:19:07.570] Because sometimes it's kind of like, oh, it's not like a family
[00:19:10.370] affair, but like the couple, you know takes care of each other
[00:19:13.170] or whatever.
[00:19:14.670] So were you just kind of imitating what your parents were doing
[00:19:17.770] or was it just like truly as a kid you were like I'm blocking
[00:19:20.970] this from my mind?
[00:19:23.870] I think it truly was just pretty low-key and I think that might
[00:19:27.670] have been how my parents are used to it as well, you know,
[00:19:31.770] small celebration, nothing too crazy and pretty chill.
[00:19:35.370] But one thing that is interesting is my parents birthdays
[00:19:39.670] are about three months apart and it's on the same day like
[00:19:45.470] day of the month.
[00:19:47.270] So I'm like, okay, that's kind of easy to remember.
[00:19:49.170] Like what was I doing when I wasn't remembering?
[00:19:52.070] Actually, it's slightly similar for my parents as well where
[00:19:55.370] my mom's birthday is on the 16th and then my dad's is on the
[00:19:59.470] 15th, but I feel like because it's one day off I would as a
[00:20:02.870] kid always like mix it up.
[00:20:04.270] Oh, it's mom's birthday on the 16th or the 15th and same for
[00:20:07.170] my dad.
[00:20:08.070] Dude.
[00:20:08.370] Okay.
[00:20:08.570] Also, yeah, I like what is wrong with our child brains?
[00:20:12.570] So my mom and dad's birthday are on the 28th, but for some
[00:20:16.770] reason I kept mixing it up with like the 29th or like even
[00:20:21.070] the 30th and I was like dude, it's like the end of the month,
[00:20:24.070] but like which day you know?
[00:20:26.070] Wait, what the fuck?
[00:20:27.770] But it's literally in my mom's email.
[00:20:31.270] Like 28 is like part of her email.
[00:20:34.470] So later I was like dude, the clues were all there.
[00:20:38.070] What was I doing?
[00:20:40.170] Yeah, dude.
[00:20:41.270] Did you ever do the thing where I don't know if you got like
[00:20:44.470] gifts for your parents, but at a young age, it's like you have
[00:20:47.370] no income and your like life savings are like $30 or some
[00:20:50.970] shit.
[00:20:51.770] So then I would always get my parents coupons and I remember
[00:20:54.670] my parents would never redeem it and after a certain year,
[00:20:58.270] I was like, is it a bad idea to make them coupon?
[00:21:00.570] Like should I stop doing this?
[00:21:03.170] But my dad would always get my mom something and same for
[00:21:05.970] my mom for my dad.
[00:21:07.470] So then I would always like sign the card that they bought
[00:21:10.170] and it would be just like me tacking my name on to whatever
[00:21:13.070] gift my parents were getting each other.
[00:21:14.670] Freeloader.
[00:21:15.570] Yeah, I'm a leech.
[00:21:19.170] Damn.
[00:21:19.570] What kind of coupons did you make for them?
[00:21:21.870] It was like, oh free like shoulder massage, free hug or use
[00:21:26.670] this coupon and I'll clean my room which they like never
[00:21:30.470] redeemed it.
[00:21:31.070] And honestly if they did redeem it, I'm not sure if I would
[00:21:33.670] actually do it.
[00:21:34.270] Oh, maybe they knew.
[00:21:37.270] They're like these are empty promises.
[00:21:39.570] They knew it would be too stressful.
[00:21:41.170] They'd be like, oh she'll stress about you know the task
[00:21:44.570] at hand, but it's fine.
[00:21:47.570] True.
[00:21:48.570] I did not really give my parents gifts, but I did occasionally
[00:21:54.870] for like Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[00:21:58.570] Dude.
[00:21:58.870] Okay, you know what?
[00:21:59.970] Maybe like when I was really young, I didn't think my parents
[00:22:03.270] had birthdays and I just thought it was like Mother's Day
[00:22:05.370] and Father's Day.
[00:22:06.270] Whoa.
[00:22:06.870] Oh like that Trumps or like it takes precedence over their
[00:22:10.370] birthdays now.
[00:22:11.270] Yeah, just their role as parents.
[00:22:14.470] Yeah, because like at school they always make you make a
[00:22:18.170] card think about Mother's Day and Father's Day, but I guess
[00:22:22.670] because it was so ingrained in me from school, but like not
[00:22:26.470] their birthdays, you know, because they don't know when your
[00:22:28.570] parents birthdays are.
[00:22:29.970] So to me I was like, oh then Mother's Day and Father's Day
[00:22:32.470] must be like the ultimate celebration.
[00:22:34.870] That's kind of interesting actually.
[00:22:36.270] I guess it's sort of like the concept of once you get married
[00:22:38.970] your wedding anniversary probably Trumps your like dating
[00:22:41.870] anniversary or whatever.
[00:22:43.870] For me, my mom's birthday is like almost identical to Mother's
[00:22:47.170] Day.
[00:22:47.570] It's usually no more than like seven days off and then my dad's
[00:22:51.470] birthday is very close to Chuseok which is like a huge holiday
[00:22:55.270] in Korea.
[00:22:56.170] So I always felt like we were coupling up their birthdays with
[00:22:59.170] like, you know, whatever holiday was close.
[00:23:01.870] Yeah.
[00:23:02.470] So I just remember thinking like oh, I'm so lucky.
[00:23:04.670] I have an August birthday because there's no holiday in
[00:23:07.270] August.
[00:23:08.370] Oh my god.
[00:23:08.970] But one time speaking of gifts and stuff.
[00:23:12.170] I did get my dad a gift.
[00:23:15.570] It was like a watch because I noticed he was kind of interested
[00:23:20.070] in watches for a hot second.
[00:23:22.670] So I bought this like random watch just like a cheap one.
[00:23:25.770] I think it was like 20 bucks or something, but it looked nice
[00:23:28.270] one of those, you know off of eBay and then I gave it to him
[00:23:32.370] well, and then he was like, thanks for the gift, but you should
[00:23:35.270] save your money for yourself.
[00:23:36.970] Oh my god.
[00:23:38.070] I have heard that line from my parents so many times.
[00:23:41.270] And I was like, oh, okay, and then I never got him a gift
[00:23:44.470] again.
[00:23:46.670] You're like the only gift you're getting from now on is love.
[00:23:50.970] Yeah, I've heard that line so many times for my parents and
[00:23:53.570] now looking back.
[00:23:54.870] It's probably so weird for them because like, you know how
[00:23:58.370] we used to get allowance from our parents.
[00:24:01.270] So then they know all the gifts that you're getting them
[00:24:03.870] is just like their own money getting returned to them basically
[00:24:07.370] but through the form of a gift that they might not have even
[00:24:10.770] wanted like, you know how when you're a kid, I feel like your
[00:24:13.770] budget is so constrained.
[00:24:16.070] Yeah, like the things that you can afford are like very very
[00:24:19.070] cheap. Our parents are probably like bro.
[00:24:21.070] I don't want this like duct tape wallet.
[00:24:22.870] Dude, $10 or whatever.
[00:24:25.370] Yeah.
[00:24:26.270] Oh my god.
[00:24:27.170] I just thought of something really cursed that I used to do
[00:24:29.570] what I used to dig through the cabinets of like our house and
[00:24:34.470] find old stuff and like wrap it and give it to my parents as a
[00:24:38.470] gift.
[00:24:39.470] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:24:40.770] What was their reaction?
[00:24:42.570] They were just like, oh, thank you.
[00:24:44.470] This is so sweet.
[00:24:45.470] Like they wouldn't be like wait, is this from like the office
[00:24:48.470] or whatever.
[00:24:49.570] I remember being like, oh I should wrap them like this.
[00:24:52.870] I mean it was like stuff that was either unused or like still
[00:24:56.770] in their original packaging.
[00:24:58.470] So it's like new still right and then I would just wrap it but
[00:25:01.970] it's like our parents knew like my parents knew.
[00:25:05.870] They're like wow so clever.
[00:25:09.570] They're like what is wrong with this child?
[00:25:11.870] I think also like maybe my parents are weird about receiving
[00:25:16.470] gifts.
[00:25:17.270] Oh really?
[00:25:18.570] Yeah, because I did give them a gift a couple Christmases ago
[00:25:23.970] and they like don't even use them.
[00:25:26.270] Oh no, but they were like very simple gifts.
[00:25:29.970] So I got my mom like this coach card holder and then I got my
[00:25:34.970] dad this leather cast iron handle that you can put on so
[00:25:38.970] you don't burn yourself and then my mom she's like wow,
[00:25:44.070] thanks.
[00:25:44.670] And then she puts her cards in a ziploc bag and I'm like why
[00:25:50.770] she's like so I look poor and no one will steal from me and
[00:25:53.870] I'm like, holy shit.
[00:25:55.170] That's so funny.
[00:25:56.970] And she's like also it's waterproof in the zip lock bag
[00:25:59.570] and I'm like dude unrefutable.
[00:26:01.970] That's actually facts.
[00:26:04.170] I was just like, oh my God and then for the the like cast iron
[00:26:09.170] handle thing like it wasn't being used for a while.
[00:26:11.970] It was just like in the kitchen drawer occasionally.
[00:26:14.770] It gets pulled out to use to get used and I was like, okay
[00:26:17.770] nice.
[00:26:18.170] I guess this one's getting a little bit of use.
[00:26:21.170] I feel like that's so funny because my parents approach gifts
[00:26:24.270] in such a different way like my parents quirk about gifts sort
[00:26:27.770] of is that they'll always make it a point to like use it when
[00:26:31.670] we're in there.
[00:26:32.170] Like I don't know if I'm not there like if they're actually
[00:26:34.770] using it or not, but when me and James go over my dad is
[00:26:37.470] always like up remember this sweater like you got it for me.
[00:26:40.970] I'm like, oh, thanks for wearing it.
[00:26:44.470] But I feel like the thing about my parents is one whatever
[00:26:49.370] I buy for my dad.
[00:26:50.470] I feel like it's an idea from my mom or like sometimes I'll
[00:26:53.270] think of things like oh my I think dad needs this or whatever
[00:26:55.970] but my mom is always like, oh, yeah, you should get your dad
[00:26:58.570] this sweater or like a scarf or whatever or some sort of idea.
[00:27:03.070] So that's always been helpful.
[00:27:05.470] She knows what he wants.
[00:27:07.070] Yeah, dude.
[00:27:07.670] She's got all the Intel and then my mom is kind of interesting
[00:27:11.770] to shop for because she'll like make these jokes about what
[00:27:14.570] she wants.
[00:27:15.870] So for Christmas I called her and I was like, hey James and
[00:27:18.570] I are going to go grab some gifts for you at the mall.
[00:27:20.970] Like what do you want?
[00:27:21.870] She's like I want something shiny and glamorous.
[00:27:24.870] I was like, this is like even less helpful than just being
[00:27:28.070] like, I don't know, get whatever.
[00:27:29.770] It's like so pointed and specific that I'm like now I have
[00:27:32.470] to find look at everything that's shiny in this mall.
[00:27:37.470] Yeah, my guess is maybe it's how they were raised.
[00:27:42.870] Okay, I have a theory here perhaps in China, you know communism
[00:27:49.470] so they didn't really get gifts in the beginning of their
[00:27:52.070] life because you know, everyone gets the same stuff though.
[00:27:55.970] Maybe that like has evolved.
[00:27:57.470] So now they're like kind of awkward about receiving gifts
[00:28:00.170] because they're just used to like, oh if I want this then
[00:28:02.570] I'll buy it.
[00:28:03.970] Now that I have the capability to.
[00:28:06.270] That's true.
[00:28:07.070] I guess there's also a bunch of other stuff that I could think
[00:28:09.770] of too where like families were bigger back then.
[00:28:13.170] So maybe one birthday out of like six or seven people in
[00:28:16.670] the family not as big of a deal or I think Asia in general
[00:28:20.770] was a little bit more poor.
[00:28:22.270] So I know my parents didn't grow up with like a ton of money.
[00:28:25.570] Yeah, I guess it's kind of sweet that they didn't make their
[00:28:28.170] own birthdays like a huge deal, but they still threw birthday
[00:28:30.870] parties for us and try to make our birthdays a bigger deal
[00:28:34.370] than it was for them.
[00:28:35.570] Definitely.
[00:28:36.970] Do you remember what you did in like junior high and high
[00:28:40.870] school because at that point we're like sort of functioning
[00:28:44.270] humans and we can make decisions sometimes.
[00:28:48.670] So did you go to your parents and ask like, oh my God, like
[00:28:51.870] I want to do this for my birthday or were you kind of just
[00:28:55.370] like whatever?
[00:28:57.170] I don't know why but I low-key have zero recollection of what
[00:28:59.970] I did for my birthdays in middle school, but high school
[00:29:02.770] birthdays actually my parents were still fairly involved and
[00:29:05.570] they still threw me birthday parties.
[00:29:08.270] So the big one that I remember was probably like my 15th
[00:29:11.170] birthday, I believe where my parents put up like a tent in
[00:29:16.070] my backyard and then we put a bunch of sleeping bags in there
[00:29:19.470] and a bunch of my friends came over.
[00:29:21.270] We didn't actually end up sleeping in that tent because we
[00:29:23.570] stayed up playing Just Dance all night.
[00:29:26.470] Oh my God, set up like a TV in the garage and like a sofa and
[00:29:30.070] we literally just played Just Dance for hours and hours and
[00:29:34.670] at 5 a.m.
[00:29:35.470] We crawled into the sleeping bag and took like a 10-minute
[00:29:38.170] nap and then everyone left at like 7 or 8 a.m.
[00:29:41.670] It's crazy.
[00:29:43.270] The amount of energy.
[00:29:44.770] Holy shit.
[00:29:45.870] Yeah, dude.
[00:29:46.870] That was wild.
[00:29:47.870] That's so sweet though.
[00:29:49.170] Yeah, I was like it's sweet that they still cared so much
[00:29:52.170] to be like, oh you should do this thing.
[00:29:53.770] We'll pitch a tent whatever.
[00:29:55.770] It's just nice to have them still be involved but not necessarily
[00:30:00.070] like helicoptering or like chaperoning the event.
[00:30:03.670] Yeah, and then I think the other big one that I can recall
[00:30:07.270] was probably like my 16th or 17th birthday, maybe my 16th,
[00:30:11.470] but we all went out to dinner at Santana Row which I feel
[00:30:14.570] like is such a like Bay Area classic and we all wore like
[00:30:18.270] our nicest dresses and wore heels and that was like the time
[00:30:23.070] to really dress up.
[00:30:24.670] Wait, we totally did something like that too for someone's
[00:30:28.070] 16th birthday like the exact same thing.
[00:30:30.070] We went to Santana Row.
[00:30:31.870] We went to what Maggiano's I think and then yeah, we all
[00:30:35.770] like dressed up.
[00:30:37.370] Oh my god, you're bringing back memories.
[00:30:39.370] Dude.
[00:30:40.470] So nowadays when I go to Santana Row, I guess I haven't
[00:30:42.570] gone for like a hangout in a very long time, but I'm not
[00:30:45.270] really like dressing up right?
[00:30:46.570] It's just like I'm like, oh I need to stop by and grab something
[00:30:48.570] from this one store.
[00:30:49.470] But every time I go I think about like, oh this used to be
[00:30:52.570] such a place where I would wear like my nicest shit.
[00:30:55.470] Dude.
[00:30:55.970] Like come in like a dress and I'm like, oh my god, it's like
[00:30:58.770] a huge deal that we're like wearing dresses.
[00:31:01.270] And we were like 15 year old.
[00:31:03.470] Yeah.
[00:31:04.470] And I remember my friends got me a sash and it was like
[00:31:06.970] sweet 16 or something like that.
[00:31:09.570] I also remember in high school, I think on average birthdays
[00:31:13.970] were a little more like, oh, let's just go out and get dinner.
[00:31:17.170] Mmm true.
[00:31:18.370] Yeah.
[00:31:18.570] So I remember like sometimes would go to places like
[00:31:20.770] Cheesecake Factory and have dinner and then like walk around
[00:31:24.570] or sometimes it would be like let's eat dinner and then go
[00:31:27.470] watch a movie after.
[00:31:29.270] Like I think birthday parties started to like tone down
[00:31:32.470] a little more but but then like of course 16 was such a big
[00:31:35.570] deal.
[00:31:36.070] Right.
[00:31:36.470] I remember for 16.
[00:31:38.370] I asked my parents.
[00:31:39.270] I was like, oh my god, I want to have a 16th birthday party.
[00:31:42.170] It's like a thing here.
[00:31:43.770] Like for some reason 16 is a big age.
[00:31:46.970] Yeah, and my parents were like that's interesting.
[00:31:50.170] And then my dad was like I guess at 16 you can get married.
[00:31:53.670] Whoa, because that's what it originally was right?
[00:31:57.170] I had no I like I never made that connection.
[00:32:00.770] And so I just invited a bunch of friends over to my place
[00:32:04.070] and then we like cooked dinner together and then we watched
[00:32:07.370] a movie.
[00:32:08.270] That's so cute.
[00:32:08.970] Actually.
[00:32:09.270] That's like kind of an adult thing to do to cook dinner
[00:32:11.470] together.
[00:32:12.370] Yeah, we made pasta.
[00:32:14.970] Wow.
[00:32:16.770] That's also funny too because I feel like when we were younger
[00:32:20.270] the coolest stuff to do were things that made you feel like
[00:32:22.970] an adult.
[00:32:23.870] I remember even when we went out for dinner or like when
[00:32:26.770] we had people over and had dinner together.
[00:32:29.470] We always needed to have cider because you know how the cider
[00:32:32.770] comes in like it almost looks like a wine or like champagne
[00:32:35.770] bottle.
[00:32:36.570] Yeah, I remember that was a go-to thing like it always had
[00:32:39.370] to be there.
[00:32:40.470] Definitely definitely and it always looks like champagne
[00:32:44.370] too when you pour it out.
[00:32:45.670] Yeah, I did feel like there was a shift though during this
[00:32:50.770] time like as I mentioned around high school.
[00:32:53.670] I started being more like cognizant of my parents birthdays.
[00:32:57.270] Mm-hmm.
[00:32:57.870] So then around that time I started remembering like, oh my
[00:33:02.070] God, like should we go get a cake?
[00:33:03.770] It's you know, almost dad's birthday or it's almost mom's
[00:33:06.070] birthday or should we go out to eat?
[00:33:08.670] Of course at the time it could only be suggestions as a poor
[00:33:12.470] high school student and then in like college, I would always
[00:33:18.170] make sure to like text to be like happy birthday.
[00:33:20.370] Whoever my brother would immediately text me after be like,
[00:33:23.570] oh, it's like mom's birthday today.
[00:33:25.570] I'm like, yes, that's why I sent the text.
[00:33:27.570] He's like, okay.
[00:33:28.870] He sent the text after.
[00:33:31.370] Now that like we're adults.
[00:33:33.170] I feel like there's so much more power in our hands, I guess.
[00:33:37.770] So like especially right now because I'm so close to my parents
[00:33:41.270] like physically, so it's a lot easier for me to be like, oh,
[00:33:44.670] hey, it's like dad's birthday today.
[00:33:46.770] Let's go out and eat a meal or like, you know, hey, it's mom's
[00:33:49.570] birthday.
[00:33:49.970] Let's go out and eat a meal.
[00:33:51.370] What do you want to eat?
[00:33:52.270] I'll like take us all out or whatever.
[00:33:54.070] So I feel like there's slowly been a shift from like not even
[00:33:59.170] registering that my parents had birthdays to like now kind of
[00:34:03.170] taking control of well not taking control of the day but like
[00:34:07.170] stepping up to offer plans and suggestions.
[00:34:10.570] Dude, I actually totally agree with that because it's like now
[00:34:14.870] that we're autonomous adults, I guess and I think especially
[00:34:18.370] the pivotal moment for me was when I got my license and got
[00:34:22.570] a car.
[00:34:23.370] So it's like if I do want to get a present, I no longer have
[00:34:25.770] to be like, oh mom, should we go to Mervin's and get dad?
[00:34:30.470] It's like, okay, I can drive to Valleyfair and like get something
[00:34:33.170] for my dad.
[00:34:33.770] True.
[00:34:34.570] But I think the other weird thing for me too is I guess age
[00:34:39.170] registers a little bit more for me now in terms of how I see
[00:34:42.370] birthdays for my parents.
[00:34:44.170] And what I mean by that is like when I was young is like, oh
[00:34:47.370] it's mom's 42nd birthday or like it's dad's 45th or whatever
[00:34:51.170] whatever and it was just kind of like a number but I think
[00:34:55.270] now my dad hit 60 for his birthday last year and I felt so
[00:35:01.970] many emotions about it.
[00:35:03.770] And I think my dad did too because it's a big deal when the
[00:35:07.470] like first digit of your age changes and it was kind of like
[00:35:11.870] a thing where we lightly talked about it like, oh haha, it's
[00:35:15.370] a big deal back in Korea in the old days like 60 was a thing
[00:35:20.170] where you threw like a huge party because it's like, oh you
[00:35:22.470] hit 60 congratulations.
[00:35:23.870] That's rare now.
[00:35:25.170] It's obviously not as crazy of a milestone to reach 60, but
[00:35:29.570] it's just I think about it a little more like it's a little
[00:35:32.970] bit morbid in a sense and a little bit sentimental, but I
[00:35:37.170] feel like age is like a big deal now.
[00:35:40.570] Dude.
[00:35:41.370] Yeah.
[00:35:41.770] Oh my God speaking of my dad also turned 60 this past year,
[00:35:46.670] but the okay the bad thing was my mom was out of town for
[00:35:50.570] that period of time.
[00:35:52.170] So like the house wasn't complete.
[00:35:54.670] I think I had like plans or something.
[00:35:57.770] And so we kind of like just like missed it in terms of like,
[00:36:01.870] you know getting everyone together to like eat food and like
[00:36:04.870] have a cake and then when my mom came back she was like, oh
[00:36:08.170] dad turned 60.
[00:36:09.370] Did you guys celebrate?
[00:36:10.370] And I was like, oh and I was like, well, you know, it's your
[00:36:14.570] birthday soon too and you both turned 60.
[00:36:17.570] So we'll celebrate for your birthday.
[00:36:20.770] I was like, but I did give dad like a mooncake.
[00:36:25.270] My mom was like what the fuck?
[00:36:27.570] Wait, I feel like I had such a like the almost the exact opposite
[00:36:31.270] experience with you.
[00:36:32.770] So when my dad turned 60, I was like, oh, it's like a huge deal
[00:36:36.070] and it was kind of like in the throes of wedding planning.
[00:36:38.770] It was like two or three months before the wedding.
[00:36:42.370] So we were super busy, but I was still like, okay, this is
[00:36:44.670] a big birthday.
[00:36:45.270] Like we need to fly to Texas.
[00:36:46.970] So James and I took we didn't take the week off, but I had
[00:36:50.070] made sure like my weekends in Dallas were like completely
[00:36:53.370] free so that we can celebrate my dad's birthday.
[00:36:55.870] Right and we were there for like a week or 10 days or something,
[00:36:58.970] but for some reason my dad is busier than me and James are
[00:37:03.370] so of those 10 days.
[00:37:05.970] He was like out of town for like four days and then like three
[00:37:09.170] of those nights.
[00:37:09.870] He had like social obligations with other people and his
[00:37:12.870] friends and then like one of those days he was working and
[00:37:16.370] like busy with meetings all night.
[00:37:18.470] So we really had like maybe like a day and a half to celebrate.
[00:37:22.570] So I was like, why are we here for 10 days when you can only
[00:37:24.970] hang out with me to grab like dinner ones and then we played
[00:37:27.370] like golf another day or something.
[00:37:29.670] You're like, wait a second.
[00:37:31.070] Yeah.
[00:37:31.370] I was like dad is too busy and popular for me.
[00:37:33.770] Yeah.
[00:37:34.370] Wait.
[00:37:34.570] Oh my God.
[00:37:35.070] I'm remembering now what the plans were for my dad's birthday.
[00:37:38.870] He actually had plans to go camping with some of his friends
[00:37:42.170] because I think it was like a full moon day of that month,
[00:37:46.270] you know, they went up to a camp spot and all excited and
[00:37:51.470] then it like poured.
[00:37:53.370] Oh my God.
[00:37:54.670] My dad was like dude, like we didn't even see the moon.
[00:37:57.170] It was just like cloudy and cold and rainy and then he like
[00:38:01.170] came back and I was like, oh happy birthday and I gave him
[00:38:05.470] a mooncake.
[00:38:06.870] So we had the same experience where our dads were like, I
[00:38:10.170] don't want to spend my birthday with you.
[00:38:13.370] It slipped my mind for a day.
[00:38:15.470] So I was like, oh shoot.
[00:38:16.470] I felt bad and I was like, okay, we'll have to celebrate when
[00:38:19.170] mom's back.
[00:38:20.370] I think also it felt kind of wrong to be like just me and
[00:38:23.370] my dad like we're missing our third person.
[00:38:26.470] So I was like, oh my God, why are you out of town mom?
[00:38:30.570] Actually, it's your fault.
[00:38:33.470] Yeah, it's like interesting to me too the way you kind of
[00:38:36.570] said now it's more of our role to take charge or like we
[00:38:40.670] at least have the opportunity to like step up to sort of
[00:38:44.070] lead the whole birthday shenanigans and yeah, I feel like
[00:38:47.270] that's very true.
[00:38:48.570] One of the things that I remember my parents always saying
[00:38:50.570] when I was younger kind of going back to like the oh don't
[00:38:53.170] spend your hard-earned money on a gift for me thing is like
[00:38:56.470] my parents would always be like, oh, it's not that big of
[00:38:58.270] a deal.
[00:38:58.770] Like we'll celebrate it but let's keep it low-key.
[00:39:01.270] But now I'm like why?
[00:39:03.570] You know, we can do the whole thing do the party hats and
[00:39:07.370] do the you know balloons and I remember once I did bring
[00:39:11.470] the party hats and I made all of us like wear it and as
[00:39:14.570] like silly as it is.
[00:39:16.570] I feel like these things kind of matter and they do sort
[00:39:19.370] of make an impact and you can always at least have like
[00:39:21.970] funny photos to like back on.
[00:39:24.270] Now, I feel like especially after the whole like, oh we
[00:39:26.770] did our wedding.
[00:39:27.270] So let's just fucking celebrate everything we can kind of
[00:39:30.470] mentality.
[00:39:31.670] I'm like, maybe I'll get the huge, you know, like the sorority
[00:39:34.270] girl balloons with like the age on it.
[00:39:38.170] Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:39.470] Six one, my sweet sixty one.
[00:39:43.870] But it's like let's just go all out and not, you know, not
[00:39:47.970] listen to them when they're like, oh, let's keep it low-key
[00:39:50.170] this year, right?
[00:39:51.470] Yeah.
[00:39:52.270] Also a reason why this topic is so top of mind is because
[00:39:56.070] today is my mom's birthday.
[00:39:59.370] So I was like thinking back on how I was like, yeah, we'll
[00:40:03.470] celebrate for sure when you're back and then you're both
[00:40:06.470] 60 and we'll make sure to get a cake and everything.
[00:40:10.070] Okay.
[00:40:10.270] Also, what's funny is that no one in our family really likes
[00:40:14.370] cake except for my mom.
[00:40:16.470] So she's like goddamn like every time we get a cake is just
[00:40:20.070] me left eating it.
[00:40:22.970] Damn, maybe I should do like slices.
[00:40:24.870] Although I guess it's not doesn't look visually as nice.
[00:40:27.970] We always make the birthday person blow out their candles.
[00:40:31.670] Yeah, but yeah, I think what I started doing is after I
[00:40:35.770] discovered thanks to you actually that like Paris Baguette
[00:40:39.070] does the smaller cakes.
[00:40:41.470] I was like, oh we should just get like not big cakes then.
[00:40:45.670] Dude, it's the best because sometimes it's like a fucking
[00:40:48.470] chore.
[00:40:49.370] Oh my God birthday cake for breakfast for the next week.
[00:40:52.970] Wait, actually that's legitimately what my mom does and
[00:40:55.870] she's like you guys aren't going to help and we're like, oh,
[00:40:58.870] you know, I don't really eat cake but sometimes my dad helps.
[00:41:04.070] I know I think it truly becomes like a mission.
[00:41:06.270] It's like oh don't eat too much for dinner because remember
[00:41:08.170] we have cake in the fridge.
[00:41:10.770] Well, a very happy happy birthday to your mom.
[00:41:13.670] Hopefully you guys can have a nice celebration with your
[00:41:16.570] family.
[00:41:17.470] The cake thing is funny too because now that I'm like long
[00:41:20.370] distance family ship with my parents if I'm not able to celebrate
[00:41:24.570] their birthdays in person, I'll like door dash them cake and
[00:41:28.070] especially since they moved around a little bit.
[00:41:30.170] I feel like I'm always trying to find like the best bakery
[00:41:32.470] near them, but it's like I can really only go off of like
[00:41:35.270] Yelp reviews or some shit.
[00:41:37.070] So I'm always like how's this bakery?
[00:41:38.870] Like should I go to this other bakery next time?
[00:41:40.970] Yeah, that's nice.
[00:41:42.470] And I feel like a lot of the time it's just like the acknowledgement
[00:41:46.370] and like knowing that we're also thinking of our parents that
[00:41:50.870] like makes them happy, hopefully.
[00:41:54.070] So, you know, even if it's a low-key event at least we are
[00:41:59.170] participating in it and remembering it like this special day
[00:42:02.970] unless my parents are like, please stop.
[00:42:05.270] I think I will continue to try and celebrate in whatever way
[00:42:11.070] with my parents.
[00:42:12.170] Yeah, I love that.
[00:42:13.470] I think same for me as well.
[00:42:15.070] I'll always try to make it a little bit special for them.
[00:42:18.570] Even if the mission of figuring out what they truly want for their
[00:42:21.570] birthday is like the hardest ever.
[00:42:23.870] Oh my god, dude.
[00:42:25.170] Maybe it's actually a blessing that my parents are awkward about
[00:42:28.270] gifts because then they never ask for gifts.
[00:42:31.370] So I'm like, okay, then I'll just like pay for dinner today or
[00:42:34.870] like, you know, I'll make sure to go get the cake today and
[00:42:37.270] then I'm like nice.
[00:42:38.070] I don't have to think about gift giving for them.
[00:42:41.170] Dude, my parents literally just gave up for their gifts to me.
[00:42:44.170] Like I feel like I still try to get them something like a product
[00:42:47.870] but my mom is like, I'm just gonna Zelle you like couple hundred
[00:42:51.670] dollars.
[00:42:52.270] Like is that cool?
[00:42:53.170] I'm like, okay.
[00:42:54.470] Like damn.
[00:42:56.370] I'm like, can I at least get like a card or some shit?
[00:43:00.570] She's like no, just the bank receipt.
[00:43:02.870] But yeah, they're so like chill about it.
[00:43:04.470] I'm like, oh my god, I need to get something special.
[00:43:06.270] My mom is like, yeah, you're getting cash.
[00:43:09.870] Not even a birthday message on the Zelle payment by the way.
[00:43:14.170] Oh my god, that's so funny.
[00:43:17.070] Ultimately, I think it's really nice to just celebrate with
[00:43:19.770] your parents and I think it's also a good reminder that like,
[00:43:23.570] you know, our parents are getting older.
[00:43:25.770] So cherish the time that we have with them.
