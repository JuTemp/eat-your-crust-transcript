[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:15.450] Alright, so before we go into our topic today, I want to introduce a new Gen Z word.
[00:00:20.930] I feel like I'm kind of taking over this segment for the day as a substitute.
[00:00:26.450] But this word is crashing out. And I feel like I've started to see trickles of this
[00:00:31.970] maybe like six months ago or so. And then recently I see it used a little bit more commonly as well.
[00:00:38.030] But essentially what this word means to me is like, I'm fucked up or this got me fucked up.
[00:00:45.890] So an example in meme format is me genuinely crashing out on the first day of school
[00:00:51.710] if I'm required to do an icebreaker for more than one class.
[00:00:55.150] That's a good one. I feel like that's very relatable.
[00:00:58.350] It is.
[00:00:58.990] It's very tiring to do icebreakers all day.
[00:01:01.470] Yeah, and I feel like I see this the most when some sort of news breaks out about like a celebrity
[00:01:09.410] or something like that. Or say there's a TikTok where it describes a scenario where you would be
[00:01:15.630] sad or upset. The comments will be like, yeah, this got me crashing out. It's pretty reminiscent of
[00:01:21.730] like other slang that describes getting into a certain feeling about something like feeling upset.
[00:01:28.850] Yeah, I actually haven't really seen this one around. But to be honest, I have been not really
[00:01:35.490] scrolling TikTok lately. So I haven't been up to date on the trends for a while. But I think that
[00:01:42.550] makes sense. I guess like the first image that comes to my mind for crashing out is crashing a car.
[00:01:50.410] Either that or I think it's still very common to say like caffeine crashes or something.
[00:01:55.110] So then I guess in my mind, I'm just thinking like it's kind of similar. You know, you're hella tired
[00:02:01.210] after a caffeine or sugar rush, and then you crash and you take a nap. So crashing out is kind of like
[00:02:07.390] related to that in a way.
[00:02:10.190] Actually, I feel like that kind of tracks with maybe the more original definition of crash out. So if you
[00:02:16.950] Google crashing out, one of the definitions is what I just described. So someone feeling upset.
[00:02:22.250] But another definition could be someone who loses control and freaks out, whether that means
[00:02:29.730] they're unpredictable and outbursting, or it could also mean someone who indulges in bad behavior.
[00:02:38.830] Yeah.
[00:02:39.110] So I feel like the definition is really broad.
[00:02:42.290] It is a little broad.
[00:02:43.350] Yeah, it like changes depending on what context you use it.
[00:02:47.550] Okay, I think that makes more sense because I'm looking at some examples. And this one says,
[00:02:53.690] when a boy talks to us crazy, but we remember we have crash out BFs. My interpretation of this
[00:03:00.990] is that the girls who are getting talked to by the boy are like, Oh, yeah, I have my best friend who I
[00:03:08.010] can crash out with like act crazy with to like freak out about this dude talking to them crazy with.
[00:03:14.570] Yeah, that that makes sense. Maybe I don't know. It's a little vague. Hopefully I'm interpreting
[00:03:22.150] this correctly. All I know is crash out basically means crazy. Crazy, unpredictable or bad. I think
[00:03:32.250] it's the conclusion of this word. Okay. Another one that kind of makes sense is this video. It says
[00:03:39.610] POV bro didn't answer the call. So no one could talk you out of crashing out. So like no one could
[00:03:45.990] talk him out of acting up or like being crazy. Yeah, makes sense. This one says me crashing out when
[00:03:54.510] I text first and get left on delivered for 0.5 seconds. That's a good one. So I think we have
[00:04:03.470] gotten to the gist of the term. Okay, I'll keep my eye out for this one. I feel like I haven't really
[00:04:10.430] seen it. But yeah, as I said, I haven't really been scrolling as much lately. This one I just thought
[00:04:16.350] was relevant because I've been hearing it more in like podcasts. Oh, yeah. What so like we crash out
[00:04:22.250] in the podcast? Like someone would talk about kind of a kid to our crises episodes. Yeah,
[00:04:28.370] someone would be like, dude, I've been crashing out lately. Like I've been super fucked up,
[00:04:33.230] emotional, you know, not doing so hot. Oh my god. Yeah, I guess our crises episodes are
[00:04:39.290] like us just crashing out. Exactly. Wow, I feel connected to this word now.
[00:04:48.870] Well, today our topic actually has nothing to do with the word. But our episode today is going to be
[00:04:56.890] about neighbors. And I feel like this is kind of an interesting topic because having neighbors is
[00:05:03.370] unavoidable to an extent. But the level of interaction you have with them is very contextual based on where
[00:05:10.670] you live, what kind of neighborhood you live in, and also what kind of personality you have. So let's
[00:05:15.930] start this with a very simple question, which is, do you say hi to your neighbors? Oh my god, I
[00:05:22.470] I have a problem. I do not. Although actually, when we were first creating this topic, I had zero
[00:05:34.930] interaction with my relatively new neighbors. But since then, it's been a couple weeks. So I actually
[00:05:42.130] have interacted with them like once. Once. Yeah. So actually, when I moved in, I had a different
[00:05:52.050] neighbor, but they moved out shortly after I moved in because I guess their lease was up
[00:05:56.730] and they wanted to find a bigger place. But that neighbor was really nice because I was moving in
[00:06:02.430] and they actually reached out. They like came by and said hi. And they're like, hey, let me know if
[00:06:07.030] you need anything. I was like, oh my god, they're so kind. And we actually share a garage. I was like
[00:06:13.630] trying to park my car in the garage. But you know, these people are probably used to having the whole
[00:06:18.750] garage to themselves for a while before I moved in. So they were really nice because they noticed
[00:06:24.330] that I tried to park the next day I came back. And they were reparking their car in the garage.
[00:06:30.230] And they were like, oh, I saw you're trying to park. So we're just gonna, you know, make sure you
[00:06:35.010] have like enough room. I know is a little cramped in there. I was like, oh my god, thank you so much.
[00:06:39.390] Like I didn't have to do any of the reaching out, you know. That is very nice. It's nice when they come
[00:06:45.370] as like a full package themselves. They do the introducing, they do the interactions with you,
[00:06:50.330] and you just have to receive it. Yeah. But once my new neighbors moved in, I literally, oh my god,
[00:06:58.910] this is kind of embarrassing. I think it was like the first week that the guy was kind of slowly
[00:07:04.770] moving in. I like would sometimes just see him walk by on my doorbell, like the camera. And I would
[00:07:12.410] think every time, because you get a notification too, right? So I just like watch this dude walk
[00:07:16.410] across my door. And I would think every time like, oh, should I like say hi? And this went on for months.
[00:07:26.350] Without saying hi. Yeah, I never said hi. Okay, to be fair, interactions are a two-way door.
[00:07:33.990] So just as you didn't say hi, like he also didn't make the first move to say hi to you.
[00:07:39.530] That's very true. Very, very good point.
[00:07:45.030] I remember texting our girls group chat too. Also, when this person was first moving in,
[00:07:51.310] I had only seen their car the first couple of days. So I didn't even know if it was like a guy or a
[00:07:57.210] girl. So I saw their car and I was like, oh my god, I texted our girls group chat. And I was like,
[00:08:02.890] do you think I could look up this person's name by searching their license plate?
[00:08:09.280] And then our friend Sarah was like, dude, Crystal, why don't you just introduce yourself?
[00:08:15.480] And then you could find out their name. And I was like, oh my god, you're right. I need to put my
[00:08:20.960] phone down and stop crashing out. Oh, it is relevant.
[00:08:27.620] Honestly, though, I feel like I can kind of understand where you're coming from, because
[00:08:31.580] this isn't necessarily always the case. But if you and your neighbor are opposite gender,
[00:08:38.240] and you yourself are like a girl, I feel like it adds like an extra layer of nervousness a little
[00:08:44.280] bit to where I might feel a little bit more safe doing a little bit of research before I actually go
[00:08:50.720] and talk to this person face to face. Whereas if your neighbor was a couple or a girl,
[00:08:56.660] then it might feel a little bit more easier and intuitive.
[00:08:59.980] For sure. So soon I found out that my neighbor is a guy because I saw him walk across my doorbell
[00:09:06.260] later. But actually, I think it's like a couple now. Like it was just the guy for a month or two.
[00:09:14.800] And then now like his girlfriend is there all the time. I don't know if she's just like living with
[00:09:19.520] him or if she just is more often than not staying over at his place all the time. Because you know,
[00:09:24.480] sometimes when it's like, you're basically living there, but you're not on the lease.
[00:09:28.820] Right, right. Maybe that is why you were able to say hi to your neighbors.
[00:09:33.460] Wait, honestly, it was because my it's still only been one interaction, I think. And that was one time
[00:09:41.280] I was like leaving to I think I was going to go grocery shopping. And I backed out of the garage.
[00:09:47.220] And then the girlfriend came and she had parked her car on the driveway. I rolled down my window
[00:09:52.620] and I was like, do you want me to like leave the garage door open? Because I know she usually parks
[00:09:57.280] her car in the garage. And she was like, yeah, yeah, I got it. And I was like, okay, cool.
[00:10:01.920] And that was like our first ever interaction. It wasn't even with the guy who I'm pretty sure is
[00:10:06.300] the main person on the lease. Your heart was probably pounding when you rolled down the window.
[00:10:11.820] Like, holy fuck. Yeah, I debated for like a quick two or three seconds. I was like, oh my god,
[00:10:16.580] like, should I roll down the window? Or should I just assume to like leave the garage door open?
[00:10:21.260] I don't know what to do. And I was like, okay, I'll just I'll just roll down my window.
[00:10:27.000] Dude, honestly, like neighbor interactions are sometimes a little bit awkward,
[00:10:31.180] especially when one of the neighbors is in the car. I feel like there's a little bit of like,
[00:10:36.280] oh, do I wave and say something in like sign language? Or will they roll down their window?
[00:10:42.340] Or should I roll down the window? So I've definitely been there.
[00:10:45.740] True. Oh my god, I actually just remembered I did have another interaction. And it was when you were
[00:10:51.700] here. We were recording an episode. True. And then the neighbor, the girl, she knocked on the door and
[00:10:58.080] was like, oh, one of your packages got delivered to our place by accident. And I was like, oh my god,
[00:11:02.340] thank you.
[00:11:04.160] You know, that actually reminds me of another interaction that one of us had with your neighbors.
[00:11:10.620] Oh my god.
[00:11:11.240] And it was one time where you were kind of out of town for a little bit. And your package got
[00:11:15.860] delivered to your porch. I think it might have been like a temperature sensitive package or
[00:11:20.360] something. Yeah. So you had asked me and James to pick it up and hold it for a little bit. And James
[00:11:26.540] went to your place and picked up your package off the porch. And he said that the neighbors you have
[00:11:31.380] across the street were like doing some sort of like barbecue in their front yard or something. And
[00:11:36.160] they were just staring at him. Like, who is this guy who just drives up, parks the car, gets your
[00:11:43.520] package and immediately leaves? Oh my god, that's so funny. I didn't realize they were out barbecuing.
[00:11:50.540] When James said that to me, he was like, neighbors gave me a weird look. I just like laughed. I was like,
[00:11:55.160] lol, haha, it's fine. I'm pretty sure they like stopped talking and just like stared at
[00:12:01.220] him as he got out of his car. It's so funny. Oh my god. Wait, actually, those neighbors across the
[00:12:09.120] street, if they're the ones that I'm thinking about, if they were barbecuing, they might have
[00:12:14.860] been like diagonally across. But the neighbors that are like directly across the street are pretty
[00:12:19.460] nice, I think. Because one time I was like packing my car with my golf clubs. And then he was like,
[00:12:25.520] oh, like you golf? They also happened to be outside. And I was like, yeah, yeah, getting ready
[00:12:30.500] to go golf that like Sunnyvale Muni or something. The dude was like, hey, that's awesome. Like we
[00:12:36.380] just came back from golfing or something. And I was like, whoa, cool. Well, I mean, you know,
[00:12:43.300] I was nicer than that. But like, it felt like a very nice interaction.
[00:12:48.340] That is really nice. Yeah. I think it's surprisingly wholesome when you have positive interactions
[00:12:53.420] with neighbors. And I do also think it's easier in a more residential area. Because now that I live
[00:13:01.020] in like a single family home, I do have a bit more interaction with neighbors. And even when we pull
[00:13:06.320] into like our street, for example, if I see another car, well, I don't do this. But James will usually
[00:13:12.560] wave at them or like put his hand up, even if it's just a random car. Versus when we lived in
[00:13:18.860] apartment complexes for a couple years, I felt like I can't even remember any interaction that
[00:13:25.180] I had with my neighbors at the time. Honestly, I think that makes sense. Because probably in like
[00:13:31.160] a single family home neighborhood, your neighbors are a little more permanent. Usually if you change
[00:13:37.540] neighbors, it's probably because someone sold their home versus like apartments is just like
[00:13:42.920] constant, you know, lease changes, you know, people are moving in and out all the time. They're
[00:13:48.660] probably way less permanent. Yeah. And I think it's a little interesting because yes, in a sense,
[00:13:55.920] apartments are way more transient in terms of how long you live there. But you also interact with
[00:14:02.420] your neighbors a little bit more, right? Like you see them in the elevator or in the lobby, or I don't
[00:14:08.720] know, some apartments, you like share a laundry room or something like that. But even so, I feel like
[00:14:13.980] there was always distance and a little bit more like privacy in a sense. Versus now, for example,
[00:14:20.880] if my neighbors have like a party and host people, like I always notice. I'm always like, oh, there's
[00:14:25.940] like a bunch of cars there, like wonder who's over. Oh my god, that's so true. You're like, who on the
[00:14:31.320] street is responsible for all these extra cars this week? Exactly. Not necessarily negative,
[00:14:38.040] but I definitely do have a little bit of nosiness in terms of our street neighbors. Honestly, that's a
[00:14:44.800] good point. In a sense, it's more private because we're all living in like our own separate homes.
[00:14:51.160] But in another way, certain things are a little more public. Because as you said, right, like if
[00:14:56.500] someone's throwing a party, there's going to be a few more cars on the street. You can sometimes tell
[00:15:01.460] if someone's not home because like, right, maybe their car is gone from the driveway. And then
[00:15:06.720] sometimes you would know if someone's like out traveling because maybe they'll ask you or another
[00:15:12.580] neighbor to like help them pick up their mail. Yeah, that actually reminds me of my family house,
[00:15:19.520] my childhood home that I used to live in with my parents. And back then, we lived in like a little
[00:15:24.760] cul-de-sac. And I feel like one of our neighbors was like the court leader. So as soon as my parents
[00:15:32.100] moved in, he like came over, introduced himself to us, basically gave us like a rundown of who lives
[00:15:38.800] in this neighborhood and which house and who has lived here the longest, etc. So I remember when we
[00:15:44.320] used to go on like family vacations, for example, we would always let him know. And then he would grab
[00:15:49.920] our mail sometimes or like, you know, sometimes he would help with our bins. In general, he was just
[00:15:55.380] like our go-to person. I do feel like that was kind of special in a sense because I don't necessarily
[00:16:00.820] think that every cul-de-sac or every street has someone like that. But it does make me wonder if
[00:16:07.500] there is a lot of opportunity to like create that kind of vibe because this guy used to host
[00:16:13.280] block parties, dude. Whoa. Yeah, I guess like you have the chance to become your street leader.
[00:16:19.920] True. I guess maybe that neighbor of yours wanted to create like almost an HOA environment without
[00:16:29.380] having to pay the HOA fees. I feel like block parties is sometimes an HOA hosted event. True.
[00:16:36.200] And I do feel like the way our neighborhood was shaped made the number of homes in that court like
[00:16:43.100] very limited. So it was probably also easier to get like a smaller group of households to commit to
[00:16:49.060] like a block party versus a really long street, for example. True. But he used to go all out. He would
[00:16:55.180] get permits from the city once a year for our block party and block, you know, like those road closure
[00:17:02.060] signs that you can get. He would block out the entrances for each side so that only people in
[00:17:08.760] our neighborhood could like drive in, but other people couldn't. Whoa. Wow, that's legit. Yeah. Maybe
[00:17:14.840] he just really liked hosting parties and being like a super nice guy. That's true. Part of me also
[00:17:21.320] wonders if that was only possible because he was from a specific generation. So he was definitely a lot
[00:17:28.380] older. And I feel like people from that generation are way more community oriented, used to being close
[00:17:38.140] friends with your neighbors, like used to chatting up people in the supermarkets and whatnot versus
[00:17:42.880] people in our generation, I feel like can be a little bit more private or closed off to strangers.
[00:17:47.720] So I don't know. I hope people do continue those traditions. But maybe it is something that kind
[00:17:55.480] of dies off with that subset of people. You're right. I think it's probably more possible
[00:18:02.340] with people who have been in their neighborhood for a long time. Because I'm just imagining like,
[00:18:09.700] you know, say one of us moves into a brand new neighborhood. And then we try to like knock on
[00:18:14.660] everyone's doors and like set a community vibe. And they're like, dude, you literally just moved
[00:18:19.960] in here like yesterday. Yeah. Who do you think you are basically? Right? Right, right. But if it was
[00:18:25.800] like someone who knocks on your door after you just move in, and they're like, yeah, I've been living
[00:18:30.860] in this neighborhood for like 50 years. These are like some of the things we do together, blah, blah, blah,
[00:18:36.560] blah. I feel like that's much more like, oh, okay, like that's the kind of neighborhood I've moved
[00:18:41.000] into. True, true. It's easier to be the leader of the block when you've known the history longer,
[00:18:47.540] you've been there longer, etc. Yeah, and I think you're right. I feel like I've noticed this too,
[00:18:52.740] as I've gotten older. Like I interact with my neighbors a lot less. Like the street that I grew
[00:18:58.100] up on, a lot of families were kind of in similar stages of life. There were like children growing up
[00:19:04.020] on the street who were close to my age, or maybe a little bit older, and we would all hang out and
[00:19:10.480] play on the streets a lot. But as I got older, and like seen a couple different neighborhoods,
[00:19:16.620] it just felt like that vibe wasn't really there anymore. Maybe like the age of the people in the
[00:19:22.680] neighborhood was like much more staggered. So then it just didn't feel as like, oh, everyone here is
[00:19:30.380] growing up together. Right? Yeah, maybe that's something that happens with, I don't know, I guess
[00:19:35.760] there's no hard and fast rule for like which neighborhoods foster what types of relationships
[00:19:41.360] with neighbors. But I have to imagine if you were moving into like, say, a neighborhood of new builds,
[00:19:47.920] where a lot of people are moving into their first starter home, a lot of people are similar ages and
[00:19:53.620] similar like stages of life, then it might be easier to get to know other families in the neighborhood,
[00:19:59.340] just because you might all be starting out at like a certain age group and might all be like starting
[00:20:04.120] families or something, versus exactly what you said with like staggered ages and different stages
[00:20:10.600] of life and whatnot, like it might feel a little bit harder. So maybe it's kind of a neighborhood
[00:20:15.960] thing and not necessarily a generation thing. Maybe. But I feel like it could maybe be a generation
[00:20:23.360] thing. But I'm also just thinking like, for example, like my parents, they're like immigrants,
[00:20:29.600] and they you know, they don't really speak super great English. So I feel like maybe it's harder
[00:20:35.800] for them to sometimes reach out to neighbors, even if that's something that maybe they want to do.
[00:20:42.280] But they like feel a bit shy or like not confident in their language skills. I do think my parents
[00:20:48.920] occasionally try to get to know our immediate neighbors on the left and right side. But I think
[00:20:55.120] it's not always super easy to be the ones like reaching out, especially if they're at a like a
[00:21:01.020] disadvantage in some way. Yeah, that's a good point. I feel like there's a specific environment that
[00:21:08.360] makes you feel more comfortable to do so versus other times you might feel more restricted or kind of
[00:21:13.840] like, oh, should I like, I don't know if I want to bother people, etc. Yeah, like I know for sure.
[00:21:18.760] At one point, my neighbors were this like, young Asian couple. And I think it was easier for my
[00:21:26.620] parents to communicate with them, especially once they found out that they could speak Chinese too.
[00:21:32.160] So it was just like a little easier to, you know, converse with them versus trying to speak with
[00:21:38.180] their like, slightly more chunky English with like other neighbors. Yeah. So it's like I could tell
[00:21:45.440] they were a little closer to that young Asian couple than our other neighbor who they did put
[00:21:51.160] an effort to get to know and talk to every now and then. But there was just a noticeable difference
[00:21:57.300] between closeness. I do also think people's individual personalities or maybe even just
[00:22:03.080] specifically their expectations of what they want from their neighbors could also be a big factor.
[00:22:08.720] Because when James and I moved into our house, we actually made the rounds of every kind of adjacent
[00:22:15.320] neighbor. So like the two on our left and right, and then also the two homes kind of across from our
[00:22:20.920] house. And we brought everyone like a small treat. And we were just like, hi, you know, we just moved in.
[00:22:27.140] Here's like a little token of our appreciation for you being our neighbor, blah, blah, blah,
[00:22:32.280] and introduced ourselves. And I think certain neighbors were definitely more receptive to it
[00:22:38.120] and more open to getting to know us versus other neighbors. It is like a pretty noticeable difference.
[00:22:43.960] Yeah, to this day, it's not like we're best friends with our neighbors, but I feel like
[00:22:47.900] we're on better terms with some neighbors than other ones.
[00:22:51.680] Yeah, I think that makes total sense, too. Especially like, if you have a super introverted neighbor,
[00:22:57.240] I wouldn't imagine that they're, you know, like hitting you up every day and like asking you for favors.
[00:23:02.000] And all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:03.640] Right, right. Yeah, like some of our neighbors sometimes ask us for lemons, and we like give
[00:23:09.060] it to them. And then other neighbors, sometimes when I see them on the street, I'm like, does this
[00:23:13.360] person want me to say hi? Or not? Like, should I wave? Or should I? There's some hesitation there.
[00:23:19.060] Not hostility, but I'm like, I don't know if they want me to acknowledge their existence.
[00:23:24.100] Yeah. They're like, oh god, Jisoo waved at me. Like, I was just trying to fucking walk by invisibly.
[00:23:30.400] Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:31.960] I totally feel that, though. I was, like, going back to my current neighbor, I was thinking about it
[00:23:36.820] because when I asked you and James if either of you could, like, pick up the package when I was traveling,
[00:23:44.220] I realized in that moment, I was like, damn, I totally should have introduced myself to the neighbors.
[00:23:48.120] We literally share a garage. Like, they could have just picked up my package and, like, tossed it in
[00:23:53.340] the garage if I knew them. I could have asked them for that favor.
[00:23:58.300] Yeah, I feel like that's also a big step, though, because I think to this day, we have been living
[00:24:03.240] in this house for three and a half years now, and we've asked people for favors maybe, like, once.
[00:24:10.480] And that favor that we asked them to do was like, oh, can you just check if this thing is still in our
[00:24:15.720] driveway? Like, it wasn't even like, oh, can you do something? It was literally like, can you, like,
[00:24:19.460] look outside your window? So I feel like even making that step to be like, oh, do you mind getting the
[00:24:24.520] package and just holding it for a day feels so big.
[00:24:27.840] Yeah, it does. It does feel big. But then when you think about it, like, in the bigger picture,
[00:24:32.860] you're kind of like, okay, but is it, you know, I'm, like, their neighbor. Is it that big of a deal?
[00:24:37.040] They're taking, like, three steps over.
[00:24:40.160] I know. It's like, if they asked me to do this, I would do it without even thinking about it.
[00:24:44.180] Exactly.
[00:24:45.720] So why are we so scared to ask them?
[00:24:47.980] I don't know.
[00:24:49.420] I think, like, right now, the good thing, though, is that I don't get much mail here.
[00:24:55.100] I think I check my mailbox once every one to two weeks, and all I get are, like, ads for, like,
[00:25:02.400] Costco.
[00:25:03.420] Right, right.
[00:25:04.640] And so I'm like, okay, at least if I'm traveling, like, I don't need someone to try to dig into
[00:25:09.400] my mailbox and, like, make it look like someone's living here.
[00:25:14.780] It's empty anyway.
[00:25:16.220] Yeah, it's literally empty anyways.
[00:25:18.540] But I do always wonder, like, if neighbors notice that you're, like, gone.
[00:25:25.180] Because in my mind, at least, I feel like there are some obvious signs when I'm gone, at least.
[00:25:31.360] Especially because it's, like, it's just one person.
[00:25:34.020] Like, there's no car movement.
[00:25:36.820] Maybe that's the most obvious thing, because I sometimes automate my lights to turn on and off when I'm gone.
[00:25:42.600] Yeah, I also automate my lights, but I think it can be kind of confusing.
[00:25:48.440] So, like, if your car is missing, they definitely know you're gone.
[00:25:52.660] Right.
[00:25:52.980] I feel like that's, like, a telltale sign.
[00:25:55.160] But if your car is still there and, say, you, like, took a flight somewhere,
[00:25:59.240] they might not know whether your car has been moving or not.
[00:26:02.600] That's true.
[00:26:03.280] Unless it's your, like, I guess for you it's kind of different because you live in a duplex.
[00:26:07.640] Like, they would definitely notice, huh?
[00:26:09.060] I feel like they should.
[00:26:10.800] They would probably be like, oh, this person, like, has not left this home in, like, a week, like, in two weeks.
[00:26:20.800] Like, are they okay?
[00:26:22.920] It's like you're still there.
[00:26:24.580] You're just inside hibernating.
[00:26:29.300] But, yeah, I always wonder, like, is the move to tell your neighbor that you're going to be gone?
[00:26:35.920] It probably is.
[00:26:37.460] So, in our, like, childhood home, that cul-de-sac had robberies happen.
[00:26:44.500] I think it was maybe just once.
[00:26:46.780] But the thing is, like, if your neighbors know you're gone and there's, like, clearly no one who's going to come visit your house,
[00:26:55.060] then they would probably know, like, if they were to see a car go in, they would probably be able to tell that it's, like, not normal.
[00:27:03.000] So, I think it is kind of, like, a safety thing.
[00:27:06.240] But part of me also is just sometimes it feels so extra to be, like, hey, I'm going to be out of town.
[00:27:11.980] Yeah.
[00:27:12.380] Like, I just imagine them being, like, so, right?
[00:27:15.760] Like, why do I care?
[00:27:17.280] Yeah.
[00:27:19.740] I guess I could tell my neighbor, like, hey, I'll be out of town.
[00:27:23.140] You can use my, like, driveway spot while I'm gone.
[00:27:25.300] Oh, that's a good point.
[00:27:26.580] Yeah.
[00:27:27.540] And then I could be, like, can you also get my mail?
[00:27:35.200] It's both an alert and a request.
[00:27:37.460] Yeah.
[00:27:39.520] But that's, like, kind of my goal right now.
[00:27:41.780] I want to have, like, an okay relationship with them where we would feel comfortable asking each other to, like, look out for packages if and when we're traveling.
[00:27:52.760] Because I think most of our friends don't really live super close to me.
[00:27:56.580] So I feel like it seems a bit of a hassle to, like, ask someone, oh, can you drive all the way over when I have a, like, neighbor right there?
[00:28:05.820] You know what I mean?
[00:28:07.660] Yeah, I feel that.
[00:28:08.660] I think even to this day, sometimes when James and I are going to be out of town for a long time, we ask his mom, like, oh, do you mind bringing the bins in or something like that?
[00:28:16.840] Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:17.800] But that totally is something that you can ask your neighbors to do, especially because you can always return the favor, right?
[00:28:25.300] Exactly.
[00:28:26.200] Wow, now that I think about it, our parents are so lucky.
[00:28:29.360] Whenever my parents are out of town, they're always like, oh, Crystal, like, can you house sit?
[00:28:33.740] Or, like, when I was still living with them, sometimes they would often go out without me and I would just be, like, home alone, you know, living there.
[00:28:42.240] Right.
[00:28:43.040] Taking care of all the mail and everything.
[00:28:45.040] And I'm like, wow, they just have a free house sitter.
[00:28:47.700] They don't need to call their neighbor up or, like, ask their friends, hey, can you pick up that package that got delivered?
[00:28:53.540] Yeah.
[00:28:53.980] I think the funniest thing, too, is sometimes they'll come back and I'll be like, oh, you got, like, a couple packages, I brought them in, I left them on your desk or whatever.
[00:29:02.660] And then my dad's like, I had packages come in?
[00:29:05.920] Like, they don't even know.
[00:29:09.400] Yeah, it's honestly a great system when you have either friends or, like, family close by.
[00:29:13.820] Because then you don't have to bother your neighbors.
[00:29:16.060] Yeah, it really, in reality, it truly should be the inverse.
[00:29:19.520] Oh, my God, so true.
[00:29:21.560] But I guess it's a little different sometimes when it's, like, it's nice to have someone who is, like, a close friend or a family member who can, like, actually go into the home versus just, like, drive-by mail pickup or something like that.
[00:29:38.780] True, true.
[00:29:39.840] Dude, but would you ever trust a friend to, like, literally house-sit your home?
[00:29:44.180] I think trust-wise, yes, definitely.
[00:29:48.120] But, one, I don't know if I would want to bother them like that.
[00:29:52.460] I think I also just don't really understand the concept of house-sitting.
[00:29:56.700] Like, unless I'm going to be out of town for, like, months and months.
[00:29:59.680] Right.
[00:30:00.000] I don't know if it's truly necessary.
[00:30:02.660] Yeah.
[00:30:03.100] Besides just, like, the mail and packages and whatnot.
[00:30:05.960] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:06.800] Yeah, I guess also because most people, like, have their own place here.
[00:30:11.140] So it's like, oh, why would they necessarily need to, like, house-sit?
[00:30:15.500] Right.
[00:30:15.880] But I do think one of the most common possibilities would be, like, if you have a pet.
[00:30:21.400] True, true, true.
[00:30:22.420] And I know a lot of people who live in, like, New York or San Francisco or, like, big cities, for example, when they travel, they either do apartment swaps or have someone sublet for, like, a couple weeks or something like that.
[00:30:35.040] Right.
[00:30:35.180] So I know it's common, but I just think deep down, I would feel a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:30:41.260] Yeah, I'm just imagining someone, like, flipping through all my shit.
[00:30:43.900] Like, oh, this is, like, you know, what's in Crystal's home.
[00:30:48.340] Or, like, even someone sleeping in my bed or something.
[00:30:51.500] I don't know.
[00:30:52.040] Just, like, I keep thinking back to Destin roasting only children a little bit in our episode last week.
[00:30:59.340] But I think as an only child, it's hard for me to imagine people sleeping in my bed or, like, using my monitor or, I don't know, any trivial thing like that.
[00:31:09.300] I think it would give me a little bit of hesitation.
[00:31:12.180] Right, right.
[00:31:13.000] That makes sense.
[00:31:15.080] It's, like, it's always a bit weird if someone's in your home unchaperoned.
[00:31:20.780] Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:21.580] Exactly.
[00:31:22.940] Like, ideally, you are there to chaperone them and be like, oh, yeah, like, you know, this you can use and, like, these are things you can use.
[00:31:29.620] But I think especially if it's, like, a permanent home.
[00:31:35.460] Your home is, you've bought it.
[00:31:37.200] It's not a rental.
[00:31:38.000] It, there's, like, a bit more value where you're, like, dude, don't fuck up my walls or, you know, something like that.
[00:31:45.100] Versus, like, an apartment.
[00:31:46.340] It's kind of, like, oh, okay, well, this person fucked something up.
[00:31:50.560] But worst case, I'm going to eventually move out of this place anyway, almost.
[00:31:55.620] Yeah, and I think another part of it, too, is my home is perfect for me and James.
[00:32:01.820] But if someone else were to stay in it, I guess I would want it to feel like a hotel or something.
[00:32:07.000] Like, so then I would feel uncomfortable.
[00:32:09.360] Like, oh, is this, like, a good enough stay?
[00:32:11.760] Like, are they going to know how to use everything?
[00:32:13.820] That kind of trepidation also adds to the discomfort.
[00:32:17.540] Dude, I'm just imagining your home covered in sticky notes.
[00:32:21.380] Like, hey, you can use these things.
[00:32:23.220] Like, please feel free.
[00:32:24.600] Like, this is how you use the shower.
[00:32:26.680] Like, turn this way for hot water.
[00:32:28.820] And the house sitter is like, yes, I have eyes.
[00:32:32.680] Like, I have a brain.
[00:32:37.320] But I think one funny thing about neighbors specifically is sometimes my nosiness can creep up a little bit.
[00:32:46.960] And the thing about nosiness is, like, not only do I care a lot about what is going on in our neighbors' lives or, like, gardens or, you know, homes or whatnot.
[00:32:57.620] But it also makes me self-conscious about what they think and observe about us.
[00:33:04.600] So it's always a double-edged sword.
[00:33:06.560] And I feel like an easy example is when your neighbor is going through, like, renovations.
[00:33:12.040] I'm always like, oh, who's the plumbing company you're using?
[00:33:15.160] You know, like, what kind of renovations are you doing?
[00:33:17.880] And I think this is a big reason why a lot of people go to, like, open homes in their neighborhoods.
[00:33:22.020] Not necessarily because they want to buy a new house, but because you want to see what the setup is or what the status is of, like, the different homes in your street.
[00:33:32.300] But the petty example is, like, sometimes when me and James are busy, we get a lot of DoorDash.
[00:33:37.900] And I think in general, we do like to get, like, food delivery.
[00:33:40.940] I always wonder if our neighbors are, like, peering out their window being like, damn, James and Jisoo got a fucking DoorDash again.
[00:33:51.200] Okay, wait.
[00:33:52.140] But do you notice when your neighbors get delivery?
[00:33:56.880] Yes.
[00:33:57.800] Oh, fuck.
[00:33:59.920] Like, if I see it, I will be like, oh, they got DoorDash.
[00:34:04.960] But obviously, like, I don't always notice or, like, catch it.
[00:34:09.320] Oh, shit.
[00:34:10.220] Okay, you're observant.
[00:34:11.280] I feel like I never look.
[00:34:13.780] But you're right.
[00:34:14.840] Sometimes I do feel like, oh, my God, like, the car is pulling up to my side of the street.
[00:34:19.840] Like, everyone can see this person run out of their car and deliver food to my doorstep.
[00:34:25.440] Right, right.
[00:34:27.140] Sometimes if we get takeout, certain bags are very obvious, like, where you got it from.
[00:34:33.400] Like, Chipotle, for example.
[00:34:34.760] Like, everyone knows that, you know, square brown bag that's fucking Chipotle.
[00:34:39.160] Like, when I carry it in, I'm like, oh, my God, everyone fucking knows I got Chipotle again.
[00:34:45.160] They're like, there's not even a Chipotle near us.
[00:34:49.500] You know, these random thoughts come into my head where I'm like, you know, I'm having all these thoughts about, like, our neighbors.
[00:34:56.140] Like, do they give this much of a shit about me?
[00:34:59.580] I see.
[00:35:00.880] I kind of feel what you mean.
[00:35:02.760] Because, like, my neighborhood is also, like, a residential neighborhood.
[00:35:05.600] It's not, like, an apartment building.
[00:35:07.720] So, you know, when I'm, like, on my driveway unloading groceries and stuff, literally everyone can see me.
[00:35:14.060] Like, they can see what I bought for my groceries.
[00:35:17.480] Like, they can see the packages at my front door.
[00:35:21.160] Right, right.
[00:35:21.620] Like, all of that.
[00:35:23.500] It's like, it's just out on display for everyone.
[00:35:25.920] Oh, that neighbor bought something in a big box.
[00:35:29.260] I wonder what it is.
[00:35:31.520] I know, like, when it starts to stack, I'm always like, hmm, I wonder if people saw that there's, like, four Amazon boxes.
[00:35:38.560] Or maybe our neighbors are like, oh, ever since those new people moved in, like, the Amazon truck passes by our street a lot more.
[00:35:49.140] I'm trying to remember what the, like, apartment complex version of this was.
[00:35:53.300] Because all of the apartment buildings that I lived at had, like, a male locker room.
[00:35:58.720] Oh, okay.
[00:35:59.160] So I wasn't necessarily seeing that, like, something was on someone's doorstep, for example.
[00:36:04.480] But maybe the apartment building equivalent of it is, like, you can kind of hear a little bit more if someone is having a party because you might be sharing walls with people.
[00:36:14.680] Or you could smell what other people are cooking.
[00:36:18.640] That's a good one.
[00:36:20.120] Yeah, like, when you walk down the halls and you're like, oh, it's, like, dinner time and it smells fucking good.
[00:36:26.100] Right, right.
[00:36:26.740] You're like, oh, you guys are having this cuisine again.
[00:36:30.120] But you're right.
[00:36:30.940] It's usually, like, less smelly in the neighborhood, I guess, in the residential neighborhoods.
[00:36:36.680] Unless you're walking closer to one of the homes.
[00:36:39.580] I guess it, like, depends on which side of the street you're walking on.
[00:36:43.140] I guess sometimes in our neighborhood I could still smell barbecues.
[00:36:46.760] Yes.
[00:36:47.080] Like, if someone is grilling stuff, that is definitely something that wafts over.
[00:36:50.580] But, yeah, another thing I just remembered is, like, seeing the same neighbors over and over again in the apartment gym.
[00:36:56.520] But, like, never saying hi still.
[00:36:58.420] Okay, yeah, that's a good one.
[00:36:59.980] Yeah, it's actually funny how, like, in apartment buildings it's actually more private in some ways.
[00:37:06.240] Because, like, if they have a parking garage, you don't know which car they even own, most likely.
[00:37:12.900] The parking spot numbers don't always correspond with the, like, apartment number.
[00:37:17.900] And there's no windows in the hallway where all the doors are.
[00:37:21.980] So you can never, like, peer into other people's homes the way you can on a residential street.
[00:37:28.100] Oh, my God.
[00:37:28.760] So true.
[00:37:30.200] I feel like the only thing you could really do is, I know some people decorate their, like, apartment front door a little bit for Halloween or, like, holidays and whatnot.
[00:37:40.040] Or your doormat might have a little bit of flair to it.
[00:37:43.420] But really, other than that, it's just so anonymous.
[00:37:45.960] Yeah, I think, like, it's a lot more common to not know what your neighbors even look like in a big apartment building.
[00:37:53.580] Yeah.
[00:37:54.080] You just might never bump into them.
[00:37:55.900] Or maybe you do bump into them, but, like, you don't know that they're your neighbor.
[00:38:00.400] True, true.
[00:38:01.760] I remember when James and I used to live in apartment complexes, we would always try to speculate, like, who lived where.
[00:38:09.060] Oh.
[00:38:09.660] Because, like you said, unless you're literally bumping into each other, like, as you're both turning your key into your door, like, you just don't know.
[00:38:16.560] So we would always try to suss out, like, who lived where.
[00:38:20.800] The other funny thing, too, is, like, sometimes you can kind of tell if your upstairs neighbor is moving or not.
[00:38:26.720] Oh, right.
[00:38:27.220] Or, like, if they're, like, there or if the apartment is vacant.
[00:38:30.360] So, like, we would always try to, like, guess that.
[00:38:33.860] And you could be guessing for the rest of your life.
[00:38:36.360] Yeah, literally.
[00:38:37.960] Like, I think in New York, I've stayed at our friend Mel's place a couple times, and I still don't know what, like, any of her neighbors look like.
[00:38:44.960] In fact, I have never met anyone from her floor.
[00:38:49.120] I'm just like, dude, how is this possible?
[00:38:52.640] I know there was a time where James and I lived in this one apartment building, and I think because it was kind of on the newer end, it just never felt like we were bumping into anyone.
[00:39:03.040] And when you would walk through the hallway, it would, for the most part, be silent, too.
[00:39:07.800] And I was just like, I think it's just you and me living in this entire building.
[00:39:11.820] Oh, my God.
[00:39:14.240] That's so funny.
[00:39:15.560] But I do want to bring up one thing that I think could be an exciting thing for our future.
[00:39:21.600] Instead of having anonymous neighbors, in the future, we could all totally decide to live next to each other.
[00:39:28.720] Like, a bunch of our friends could be like, hey, let's all buy these homes in this one cul-de-sac and be each other's neighbors.
[00:39:35.600] Wouldn't that be so cool?
[00:39:37.190] Yeah, honestly, that would be huge.
[00:39:40.060] And we could, well, if we have kids or like all have pets, for example, like we could all go on walks together or like take our kids to school together.
[00:39:48.920] There's just so many benefits that come from having your friends as neighbors.
[00:39:52.880] Yeah, and we could have block parties because we're all like just good friends.
[00:39:57.900] True, true, true.
[00:39:59.560] Damn, that would be the dream.
[00:40:01.060] Like, I feel like we wouldn't necessarily even have to be next door neighbors.
[00:40:03.840] Like, if we just live maybe a couple minutes from each other, that would make a world of a difference.
[00:40:08.680] Yeah, like walkable distance.
[00:40:10.260] We could just walk down the block and be like, hey, can we watch Sunday night football together?
[00:40:17.660] Or if I was feeling lonely and like didn't feel a sense of community, I'd be like, hey, can you guys open your blinds and like turn your lights on inside?
[00:40:25.860] You're like, I need to know what you're doing right now.
[00:40:28.420] Yeah.
[00:40:30.000] Like, I see you guys are cooking this kind of food today.
[00:40:34.360] This actually does kind of remind me of college time because there was an area around UCSD where a lot of students lived.
[00:40:43.760] These were kind of like townhomes or like condos that a lot of students ended up living in.
[00:40:48.820] And these neighborhoods were really close to each other.
[00:40:51.920] So I remember a couple of my friends lived just like up the hill.
[00:40:56.040] So it was like maybe two minutes walk.
[00:40:58.320] So sometimes if all of my friends' roommates were out, then she'd be like, hey, Crystal, I want to come hang out?
[00:41:04.460] Okay, like I'll just walk over in a couple of minutes.
[00:41:06.860] And I think that accessibility just felt really nice and also helped build the friendship more too.
[00:41:13.600] Oh my God.
[00:41:14.280] Is that where you got your idea of like all of us buying houses in the same cul-de-sac and being neighbors?
[00:41:20.300] Oh my God.
[00:41:21.500] Actually, no.
[00:41:22.460] I got that idea when the last time a bunch of us went to your place and then I was like, oh my God, their neighbor's home is like for sale.
[00:41:31.160] Like should one of us buy it?
[00:41:35.160] Very true, actually.
[00:41:36.920] I also love how we spent so much of this episode being like, oh, I don't know if we want to be that close to our neighbors.
[00:41:44.040] And we're just like, oh, actually, we'll just have our friends be our neighbors.
[00:41:48.840] Yeah, it's the ultimate solution.
[00:41:50.900] Like why would we even let our neighbors be up to chance when it could just be us?
[00:41:57.260] Yeah, why befriend your neighbors when you can just all coordinate home buying together?
[00:42:03.840] Honestly, I am fully on board with this plan.
[00:42:06.940] It's like friends, but in the suburbs.
[00:42:11.040] Bay Area version of friends.
[00:42:12.720] Yeah.
[00:42:14.600] Yeah, but all in all, I think what we've learned is befriending your neighbors ultimately have more pros than cons.
[00:42:21.760] So I think this is something that I will think a little bit more about and try to be braver about.
[00:42:28.080] This episode is like inspo for ourselves.
[00:42:30.800] Yeah.
[00:42:31.820] To gather up the courage to talk to our neighbors.
[00:42:34.420] Yeah.
