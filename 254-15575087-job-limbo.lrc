[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_03]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:03.380] [SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Crystal.
[00:00:15.420] [SPEAKER_03]: So today we have a pretty interesting topic, which is job limbo. But before we dive into that,
[00:00:22.840] [SPEAKER_03]: Crystal, what is our Gen Z word of the day?
[00:00:25.780] [SPEAKER_00]: All right, today's word slash phrase is one that I like. I have no explanation why,
[00:00:31.220] [SPEAKER_00]: but I just love this phrase. It's catching strays. It just makes so much sense when you
[00:00:37.100] [SPEAKER_00]: see it in context. And I think it just adds another layer of funniness to whatever is happening.
[00:00:43.500] [SPEAKER_00]: So basically what catching strays means is you're getting unintentionally insulted when you aren't
[00:00:49.800] [SPEAKER_00]: even the main topic. An example could be like, you and I are talking and I'm like,
[00:00:55.700] [SPEAKER_00]: oh, don't worry, Jeesoo. You're great at this game. Unlike so and so.
[00:01:01.080] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, that third person is just catching strays.
[00:01:03.980] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I love this one as well. And I feel like it's a really easy one to use because this happens
[00:01:08.920] [SPEAKER_03]: a lot actually in real life. And I also like to think of this as collateral damage. It's like the
[00:01:15.020] [SPEAKER_03]: damage is intended for one person, but someone else who sometimes isn't even in the room is
[00:01:20.400] [SPEAKER_03]: taking the damage as well. It's like AOE damage. Oh my god. Okay, I'm trying to find some examples
[00:01:27.940] [SPEAKER_00]: on Know Your Meme. And here's a funny one. It's basketball related, but I think you can still
[00:01:33.200] [SPEAKER_00]: kind of get the gist. This one basketball media guy, he tweets, Blakers acquire second round pick.
[00:01:39.880] [SPEAKER_00]: Take Michigan State's Max Christie, who shot only 32% from three last season.
[00:01:45.680] [SPEAKER_00]: Perfect. He'll fit right in with LeBron and Westbrook.
[00:01:51.320] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that one is like a triple wombo combo right there.
[00:01:55.020] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah. I see this a lot on reality TV subreddits too. Someone will be like, oh my god,
[00:02:00.900] [SPEAKER_03]: this guy is so horrible, but at least he's not as bad as this guy. And it's just like a random
[00:02:05.300] [SPEAKER_00]: add-on person. Yeah. And I think it's also really funny when it's more subtle too.
[00:02:11.060] [SPEAKER_00]: And then someone's like, wait, hold up. This person is just fucking catching strays.
[00:02:15.360] [SPEAKER_00]: There's another funny example on Know Your Meme. I don't even know who this guy is,
[00:02:19.760] [SPEAKER_00]: but the original tweet is, again, I ask when are we going to start slut shaming common?
[00:02:25.600] [SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a bunch of pictures of this common dude with like a bunch of different
[00:02:29.760] [SPEAKER_00]: women. And then on the bottom right, there's a picture of him with Elmo.
[00:02:34.160] [SPEAKER_00]: And then the reply is like, how did Elmo catch a stray?
[00:02:38.260] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'm dead. You know, honestly, maybe this term is birthed out of people wanting to be
[00:02:48.580] [SPEAKER_03]: inclusive. We're just trying to include everyone. And this one works really well in person too.
[00:02:53.600] [SPEAKER_03]: Say you're having a conversation and you're like roasting your friend, but your other friend is
[00:02:56.860] [SPEAKER_03]: nearby and you want to loop them into the conversation. You just toss them astray.
[00:03:00.820] [SPEAKER_00]: And now they're all insulted together. Probably the funniest is when like someone
[00:03:06.640] [SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even realize that they accidentally insulted someone else in the midst of, you know,
[00:03:11.720] [SPEAKER_00]: the whole conversation. And then people are just like, wait, what the fuck? Why are these people
[00:03:15.280] [SPEAKER_00]: just catching strays? Oh man. Yeah, this is a good one. And I feel like this one will
[00:03:21.440] [SPEAKER_03]: live for a very long time because I remember this came out a couple of years ago. So it's not like
[00:03:26.960] [SPEAKER_03]: the newest slang phrase or anything. So it speaks to its longevity a little bit. Oh my God. I thought
[00:03:33.240] [SPEAKER_00]: a good one. Yeah. If I were to say something like, oh yeah, Jisoo, you're not that short. Like you're
[00:03:38.920] [SPEAKER_00]: not as short as our other friend who's only 5'2". They're like, wait, what the fuck? I didn't even
[00:03:44.640] [SPEAKER_00]: say anything. That would be for sure catching strays. True. Well, catching strays aside,
[00:03:52.520] [SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the topic at hand, which is, as you mentioned, feeling job limbo. So
[00:03:58.720] [SPEAKER_00]: to start this off, let's try to define what exactly job limbo is to us or how we perceive it.
[00:04:05.240] [SPEAKER_03]: So I think you can kind of get a sense of what this phrase means just by looking at the word
[00:04:11.320] [SPEAKER_03]: limbo. I have felt job limbo at times where I might feel stuck in my position, maybe stuck
[00:04:18.840] [SPEAKER_03]: at the company or just in general. I feel like there's no progress even forwards or backwards.
[00:04:25.340] [SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think this is always just an external thing. So I don't think it's always
[00:04:30.840] [SPEAKER_03]: about the company or the team. Sometimes I found that I experienced this on an internal level as
[00:04:36.580] [SPEAKER_03]: well, but just in general feeling stuck somehow, some way. Yeah. I think I would agree with that,
[00:04:44.080] [SPEAKER_00]: especially if you just feel like you are stagnant in growth or learning even, like it almost feels
[00:04:49.840] [SPEAKER_00]: you have plateaued and there hasn't been as many new experiences or worthwhile experiences, I guess.
[00:04:57.680] [SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that every day has to be some crazy new thing happening, but I think once you start
[00:05:02.900] [SPEAKER_00]: to feel really like, oh, I can just autopilot at work, that's probably a sign. Yeah, I can
[00:05:08.000] [SPEAKER_03]: definitely resonate with that. The other times that I found that I felt job limbo is if maybe
[00:05:14.460] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling insecurity in some way. So sometimes you might still feel like you're growing or
[00:05:20.840] [SPEAKER_03]: learning, but if there's changes going on at the company or on your team, or even recently,
[00:05:27.300] [SPEAKER_03]: there's been a lot of layoffs at a lot of tech companies as well. I feel like anytime that
[00:05:32.320] [SPEAKER_03]: happens, you start to feel a little bit unstable in a sense. Feeling that kind of instability,
[00:05:38.540] [SPEAKER_03]: whether it's in your motivation or your drive or your growth, I think always kind of leads you to
[00:05:44.220] [SPEAKER_00]: this state of limbo. Oh, that's true. When you're kind of like, oh God, am I about to get laid off
[00:05:49.860] [SPEAKER_00]: or am I safe? And that's such a terrible feeling. I remember back in the earlier waves of layoffs
[00:05:57.760] [SPEAKER_00]: when there were all those leaks. And I remember the general sentiment of these people after
[00:06:02.800] [SPEAKER_00]: hearing like, oh, this company might lay off X amount of people by next week or two weeks from
[00:06:08.100] [SPEAKER_00]: now. And people are just like, oh my God, what do I do? What if I'm one of those people who are
[00:06:12.780] [SPEAKER_00]: going to get laid off? What did the next two weeks mean to me? Right. And I guess that's the thing too.
[00:06:19.340] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like limbo is oftentimes something that we feel because we're maybe waiting for something
[00:06:25.920] [SPEAKER_03]: and for something like waiting for a potential layoff announcement or maybe sensing some sort
[00:06:31.740] [SPEAKER_03]: of instability. And these are things that don't have a true end date. So then I feel like that
[00:06:36.420] [SPEAKER_03]: can also really add to the limbo feeling of I'm waiting for something, but like when and why am I
[00:06:43.200] [SPEAKER_00]: still waiting around? Yeah. It's almost like decision paralysis. You're like, I don't know what
[00:06:48.360] [SPEAKER_00]: to do now. And then I think that definitely lowers motivation. It definitely lowers morale,
[00:06:55.580] [SPEAKER_00]: which is probably one of the bigger things that honestly keep us going at work. Definitely.
[00:07:01.080] [SPEAKER_03]: This is also something that I think about sometimes. I'm like, I wonder how obvious it is
[00:07:05.320] [SPEAKER_03]: to your manager or your teammates or even like cross-functional partners, how much someone is
[00:07:10.660] [SPEAKER_03]: kind of feeling this job limbo. Because I have definitely seen signs of it in like coworkers
[00:07:16.480] [SPEAKER_03]: sometimes. And I'm sure when I was really going through it, my coworkers have seen it in me as well.
[00:07:22.140] [SPEAKER_03]: As much as it would be nice to like keep it contained, I do feel like there is a little bit
[00:07:27.000] [SPEAKER_00]: of an external aspect to this as well. That's true. It's kind of like the people who have, you know,
[00:07:32.520] [SPEAKER_00]: already put in their two weeks notice and you can tell in the next two weeks, they're just chilling.
[00:07:37.200] [SPEAKER_00]: And like, you don't want to bother them either because you're like, oh, well, they're going to
[00:07:40.260] [SPEAKER_00]: be gone anyway. So there's no point in, you know, piling some work on them right before they leave.
[00:07:45.580] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. It's just like everyone knows that this person is like half checked out.
[00:07:50.300] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, yeah. But I do have a question for you because I feel like some of the things that
[00:07:54.140] [SPEAKER_03]: we talked about, like the factors that lead to job limbo or make us feel job limbo are similar
[00:08:00.120] [SPEAKER_03]: to things that cause burnout. So do you think there's like a difference between job limbo and
[00:08:04.940] [SPEAKER_00]: burnout? I think yes, but I think at the same time there's definitely an overlap because I think if
[00:08:10.640] [SPEAKER_00]: you're constantly burnt out at work, you kind of enter some sort of job limbo. And I don't know
[00:08:17.640] [SPEAKER_00]: what you're waiting for. Maybe you're waiting for like a break or like a vacation, but you know,
[00:08:23.020] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's just like inconvenient timing or maybe you don't want to just take a random day off.
[00:08:29.020] [SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's definitely overlap there because burnout also eats at your motivation
[00:08:34.820] [SPEAKER_00]: and morale. And sometimes burnout can be caused by maybe like work that you are realizing you don't
[00:08:41.640] [SPEAKER_03]: actually want to do. Yeah, I feel like like you said, these two things are definitely linked
[00:08:48.480] [SPEAKER_03]: and maybe job limbo is kind of a form of long term burnout. How long can you sustain burnout
[00:08:56.960] [SPEAKER_03]: before it becomes something that you can't stand anymore? And that kind of propels you into
[00:09:02.060] [SPEAKER_00]: the limbo of it all. So do you think there are any like notable signs that point towards burnout or
[00:09:10.180] [SPEAKER_00]: job limbo? I think one thing that I can think of is if there's no like forward moving progress,
[00:09:18.380] [SPEAKER_03]: like I mentioned earlier, and I feel like that actually comes in multiple forms. So one is if
[00:09:23.240] [SPEAKER_03]: you're stuck at the same position for a long time and not getting promoted or you're not
[00:09:29.260] [SPEAKER_03]: getting handed like a bigger scope of work, you are truly just stuck in a sense, right? You're
[00:09:34.840] [SPEAKER_03]: like stuck in your old R&R's, roles and responsibilities, and there's no like movement
[00:09:40.580] [SPEAKER_03]: forward. So I think that is definitely one big sign. The other sign is not seeing forward progress
[00:09:49.080] [SPEAKER_03]: in your work. And I feel like the other thing too could be you just get frustrated from not seeing
[00:09:54.600] [SPEAKER_03]: forward moving progress in your work. And one big sign is like, say you've been working on setting
[00:09:59.540] [SPEAKER_03]: up processes for something that you feel like is going to be a game changer for your team or your
[00:10:04.740] [SPEAKER_03]: department. And despite the new process, you still keep getting asked the same questions over and
[00:10:11.120] [SPEAKER_03]: over. You feel like you're just in like an infinite like loop of answering the same question. Yeah,
[00:10:17.660] [SPEAKER_03]: exactly. I mean, just like reliving the same day over and over. Then I feel like that could also
[00:10:22.680] [SPEAKER_00]: really make you start feeling stuck. That just feels very repetitive. And I'm sure, you know,
[00:10:28.480] [SPEAKER_00]: at a certain point it makes you start to question like, oh, why is this just like the same thing
[00:10:34.580] [SPEAKER_00]: every day? Dude, but also side note, R&R when I first got into the work corp culture and all that,
[00:10:42.040] [SPEAKER_00]: and you know, there's a lot of like corp slang and stuff. I know R&R as rest and relaxation.
[00:10:50.540] [SPEAKER_00]: The first time someone was like, yeah, can we get like the R&Rs in order? I was like, wait,
[00:10:55.520] [SPEAKER_00]: what? Like, are we not talking about work? What do rest and relaxation?
[00:11:00.660] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, yeah, I have a vacation. Oh my god. Also, have you seen that TikTok that was
[00:11:05.900] [SPEAKER_03]: like if you say R&R, it sounds like an Australian person trying to say oh no.
[00:11:10.500] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, yes. I have seen that. R&R. R&R.
[00:11:18.140] [SPEAKER_00]: But back to the repetition and burnout of it all. I think another aspect slash sign is if you're
[00:11:26.760] [SPEAKER_00]: trying to get out of that repetition by maybe like taking on new projects or setting new goals for
[00:11:31.220] [SPEAKER_00]: yourself, but none of these goals and projects are exciting or enticing to you. Yeah, at the
[00:11:37.920] [SPEAKER_03]: end of the day, it is work, but I feel like it should also spark some sort of joy. Otherwise,
[00:11:43.000] [SPEAKER_03]: we're just robots at work waiting for free time post-work and like on the weekends,
[00:11:49.020] [SPEAKER_03]: which I feel like is just unsustainable. You would lose motivation twice as fast, right?
[00:11:53.140] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think you're totally right. Sometimes at a gut level, it's really like, am I feeling excited
[00:11:58.300] [SPEAKER_03]: or am I feeling hopeful or any of these positive emotions or do I just feel dread, tired, stressed,
[00:12:05.240] [SPEAKER_00]: that kind of negative emotion? And I feel like some people are really good at taking on these
[00:12:10.600] [SPEAKER_00]: more repetitive tasks and they thrive in that. So all the more kudos to them. But I feel like
[00:12:17.400] [SPEAKER_00]: me personally, too much repetition sometimes can get very old very fast. So I feel like to me,
[00:12:24.660] [SPEAKER_00]: there needs to be a certain level of, yeah, as you said, excitement or just something interesting
[00:12:30.540] [SPEAKER_00]: that keeps you going. Like, okay, I know I have to do this one boring project, but it's okay because
[00:12:36.840] [SPEAKER_00]: I know I have this other more exciting project on the horizon, something of that sort, like having
[00:12:41.480] [SPEAKER_03]: that balance. Totally. I'm definitely someone who thrives on structure and routine. So I actually
[00:12:47.380] [SPEAKER_03]: don't mind repetitive stuff as much, but I feel like you can do a recurring task without it feeling
[00:12:52.420] [SPEAKER_03]: repetitive. So say your recurring task is a weekly email or a weekly report or something like that.
[00:12:58.640] [SPEAKER_03]: You get really great feedback every time you send it out. Then I feel like each week is still new.
[00:13:03.560] [SPEAKER_03]: It's rewarding. Like, you know, people are reading your stuff and benefiting from your labor of love.
[00:13:08.980] [SPEAKER_03]: But on the flip side, if it's always met with no response or there doesn't seem to be a lot of
[00:13:15.620] [SPEAKER_03]: gain from the work you're doing, I feel like that can start to feel really, why am I doing this?
[00:13:21.940] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah. And I've been reflecting on this a little bit, but I feel like just because you hit this
[00:13:28.620] [SPEAKER_03]: certain point of, is my work actually benefiting people in the company or do I really feel
[00:13:34.540] [SPEAKER_03]: excitement and joy about what I'm doing? It doesn't necessarily mean that you're doomed to be
[00:13:40.220] [SPEAKER_03]: in job limbo. I feel like it doesn't mean that you have to do something drastic, but it is like that
[00:13:47.520] [SPEAKER_03]: first warning sign. So it's like, once you start to feel this, what do you feel comfortable doing?
[00:13:52.460] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you comfortable enough to go to your boss and see if you can kind of switch things up?
[00:13:57.160] [SPEAKER_03]: Are you comfortable creating new processes and trying to push the improvement of what you're
[00:14:03.220] [SPEAKER_03]: doing from your scope of work? And at the end of the day, this could be a starting point
[00:14:08.620] [SPEAKER_03]: to discover what you want to do and what kind of work makes you feel really fulfilled.
[00:14:13.780] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I completely agree. I think starting to realize you might be headed towards job limbo or
[00:14:19.220] [SPEAKER_00]: just having that feeling of job limbo is when you need to start reevaluating things. Just like you
[00:14:25.680] [SPEAKER_00]: said, whether that means you need to look at your job holistically and be like, is this what I
[00:14:31.200] [SPEAKER_00]: want to do? Or if you need to look at the more minute details and be like, oh, you know what,
[00:14:35.800] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe these are small things I can change. Or maybe sometimes it's even just to step back
[00:14:41.620] [SPEAKER_00]: and take a look and be like, oh my god, I haven't taken a vacation in two years and I need to give
[00:14:46.700] [SPEAKER_00]: myself a week off at least and just reset and see if that helps with the burnout feeling.
[00:14:53.440] [SPEAKER_00]: It's like that moment that we've spoken of before where you go to the bathroom at a party
[00:14:58.600] [SPEAKER_00]: and you look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, okay, what is happening right now? I need to
[00:15:05.260] [SPEAKER_00]: figure out what I'm going through. Dude, that is like the perfect analogy.
[00:15:10.540] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you do need to have that moment of clarity with yourself.
[00:15:16.560] [SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about there's just so many factors that contribute to something like job
[00:15:20.700] [SPEAKER_03]: limbo. I feel like what has helped me a lot in the past is taking a look at every step of the ladder.
[00:15:27.940] [SPEAKER_03]: First, I'm like, do I like my work? Then I'm like, how am I feeling? Is there stuff outside of work
[00:15:33.620] [SPEAKER_03]: that's causing me to feel like this at work? Is there something that I can do to improve my daily
[00:15:38.900] [SPEAKER_03]: routine? Maybe build up more stamina, work out more, go out more, hang out with friends and just
[00:15:44.560] [SPEAKER_03]: make myself generally happier. Then you can start to evaluate every step of the chain within your
[00:15:49.940] [SPEAKER_03]: work. It's like your boss, your team, your department, your company, and honestly, even
[00:15:56.300] [SPEAKER_03]: your job and your career path. I think sitting down and being really honest with yourself about
[00:16:00.780] [SPEAKER_03]: a lot of these things, especially when you're younger and earlier in your career is so crucial
[00:16:06.660] [SPEAKER_00]: and key to diagnose what is wrong. I think what also helps is when this moment comes upon me,
[00:16:15.880] [SPEAKER_00]: I look back at my work and I think of what I'm grateful for in it. It's nice to remind yourself
[00:16:22.700] [SPEAKER_00]: sometimes too, like, oh, actually, I am really grateful for these aspects of my job. Then maybe
[00:16:28.080] [SPEAKER_00]: you can make a pros and cons list and then reevaluate, oh, but are these pros worth the cons?
[00:16:34.240] [SPEAKER_00]: Or it's like, oh, actually, dude, it's only two cons. I'm forgetting about how grateful I should
[00:16:38.900] [SPEAKER_00]: be for all these other things. I feel like that sometimes helps spark up some positive feelings
[00:16:44.360] [SPEAKER_00]: again. It's like gratitude journaling for your work, for your job. Dude, I love that. I think
[00:16:50.100] [SPEAKER_03]: I've done something similar, but in a little bit more of a five-year plan kind of a way.
[00:16:55.780] [SPEAKER_03]: At times where my job limbo felt pretty high, I actually forced myself to sit down and chart out
[00:17:02.040] [SPEAKER_03]: 13-week sprints essentially. Really it's quarterly goals. I would see what kind of things excite me
[00:17:09.140] [SPEAKER_03]: at work, also write down things that I don't love doing and then journal it all out on paper first.
[00:17:16.160] [SPEAKER_03]: Then that could be something that I maybe take to my boss in my one-on-ones. Hey,
[00:17:20.900] [SPEAKER_03]: things like this really excite me and I feel like would be super stimulating.
[00:17:24.440] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't love doing these tasks, but I'm happy to do them. Then at least even if you still have
[00:17:29.680] [SPEAKER_03]: to keep doing those things that you don't like to do, you're at least planting the seed and being
[00:17:34.500] [SPEAKER_03]: vocal about it, which I think really is something that helps birth change. Your manager might still
[00:17:39.920] [SPEAKER_03]: need you to do this right now, but let's say they get a new headcount in half a year or something.
[00:17:45.100] [SPEAKER_03]: They might remember like, oh, Jisoo said that she doesn't like doing this. Maybe with this
[00:17:49.360] [SPEAKER_03]: new person, they can help take this off her plate, something like that.
[00:17:52.440] [SPEAKER_00]: So true. I feel like I used to always fall in the trap of internalizing,
[00:17:56.980] [SPEAKER_00]: I guess, every perceived problem at work. Then I got advice that was, well, you can just tell
[00:18:04.680] [SPEAKER_00]: your manager that you like these projects more than the other projects. I was like,
[00:18:10.140] [SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck? You can do that? But I was like, wait, that makes so much sense because yeah,
[00:18:16.060] [SPEAKER_00]: as you said, maybe you still have to do some of the more boring projects, but at least you know
[00:18:20.020] [SPEAKER_00]: your manager, if they're a good one, is looking out for these other certain projects that they know
[00:18:26.320] [SPEAKER_00]: would bring you more joy at work. Because if you're a happy worker, you're going to produce
[00:18:30.960] [SPEAKER_03]: better work too. Yeah. And I feel like a slightly more cynical way of looking at it too is just
[00:18:38.060] [SPEAKER_03]: because you're the type of person to not be vocal about these things, it doesn't mean that other
[00:18:44.200] [SPEAKER_03]: people on your team aren't being vocal about it. So your coworker who is on the same team,
[00:18:49.360] [SPEAKER_03]: reporting to the same manager, they might be able to kind of over the years, fine tune their
[00:18:54.040] [SPEAKER_03]: projects to mostly what they want to do because they are being active and transparent about their
[00:18:59.000] [SPEAKER_03]: likes and dislikes. But you might have a worse split than them because you didn't vocalize your
[00:19:05.120] [SPEAKER_03]: opinions. In some ways, you are kind of missing out a little bit. And I feel like if you think
[00:19:11.340] [SPEAKER_00]: about it, this is for the better of yourself and actually ultimately probably for the team too.
[00:19:18.640] [SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a better state and doing work that you like and producing good work,
[00:19:24.020] [SPEAKER_00]: that's ultimately better for the team too and the people around you. So I think that's something I
[00:19:29.360] [SPEAKER_00]: had to learn too. You don't have to just put your head down and do the work and just take everything.
[00:19:35.460] [SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely okay to voice some of your opinions and hopefully have your voice heard.
[00:19:40.120] [SPEAKER_00]: And I guess if things don't get better for you, then that's a sign of further action that you
[00:19:46.280] [SPEAKER_00]: might have to take, whether that's reevaluating and finding a new job or thinking about what
[00:19:51.300] [SPEAKER_00]: roles do bring you happiness and that kind of stuff. Yeah, I completely resonate with that.
[00:19:56.400] [SPEAKER_03]: And it reminds me of something that one of my bosses has told me in the past. I think this goes
[00:20:03.200] [SPEAKER_03]: both ways in terms of if you're a manager giving feedback to your team or if you're a team member
[00:20:09.200] [SPEAKER_03]: giving feedback to your manager. A lot of companies do annual performance reviews and that's when you
[00:20:14.500] [SPEAKER_03]: go through your roles and responsibilities as well as evaluating the feedback of your work in the
[00:20:20.240] [SPEAKER_03]: past year. And what my manager told me was that anything you ever discuss in your annual performance
[00:20:27.080] [SPEAKER_03]: reviews, it should never be a surprise. These are things that you have brought up to each other
[00:20:31.940] [SPEAKER_03]: during your weekly TBs, concerns that you might have had one way or another, and there should
[00:20:38.480] [SPEAKER_03]: always be that open line of communication even throughout the year, which also then means that
[00:20:44.120] [SPEAKER_03]: you should be thinking about these things throughout the year too. So I think not waiting
[00:20:48.760] [SPEAKER_03]: for that formal once in a year time to be like, yeah, I actually don't really like this project.
[00:20:54.220] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like, actually, I've been hating my job for the past year. Yeah, you're like, this is
[00:20:58.660] [SPEAKER_00]: like my greatest accomplishment, but I fucking hated it. Wait, oh my god, you call your one-on-ones TBs?
[00:21:05.240] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, touch base. Whoa, mine's just one colon one.
[00:21:11.660] [SPEAKER_03]: But really at the end of the day, I think it goes to show you are totally valid in feeling the things
[00:21:17.440] [SPEAKER_03]: that you feel about your work and it doesn't always have to be like a temper tantrum during
[00:21:22.580] [SPEAKER_03]: a TBF. I don't like this work. It can be something very normal and casual like, yeah, I'll do it, but
[00:21:26.880] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I generally prefer projects like this. So you can totally keep it professional while still
[00:21:33.060] [SPEAKER_00]: not being silenced about your thoughts. For sure. And even better is when your manager is like, oh,
[00:21:38.540] [SPEAKER_00]: what kind of projects do you like? And you're like, oh yes, I didn't even have to bring it up myself.
[00:21:43.120] [SPEAKER_00]: You're like any project that's not like this.
[00:21:46.960] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe one of the best opportunities to bring it up is when you're near the conclusion
[00:21:51.800] [SPEAKER_00]: or have finished a project because then you can be like, oh, let's debrief about this project.
[00:21:56.560] [SPEAKER_00]: I think we accomplished all this blah, blah, blah. And then at the end you could be like,
[00:22:00.020] [SPEAKER_00]: honestly, it was a good project, but it's not like my favorite type. So hopefully in the future
[00:22:05.020] [SPEAKER_00]: we can look for projects like this. Or you could be like, oh my God, I loved this project.
[00:22:10.080] [SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have more projects like this. Dude. Yeah. That's such a good point. Cause in
[00:22:14.400] [SPEAKER_03]: the postmortem you're coming into it already having done the task that was asked of you.
[00:22:19.700] [SPEAKER_03]: So you have a little bit more leverage because you could be like, yeah, well,
[00:22:23.180] [SPEAKER_03]: I did finish this project even though I now realize it wasn't my favorite.
[00:22:27.600] [SPEAKER_00]: Dude. Can we talk about the word postmortem? Why do we use that as the debrief word
[00:22:34.640] [SPEAKER_03]: for projects? It's so morbid. It totally is. I always think of a corpse every time I hear that
[00:22:42.340] [SPEAKER_00]: word. Wait, same. I literally am thinking of the basement where all the dead bodies are. Oh God.
[00:22:50.040] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why do we need to call this a postmortem?
[00:22:55.320] [SPEAKER_00]: True. Actually, do we need a funeral for the project too? Honestly, corpse slang. There's
[00:23:01.900] [SPEAKER_00]: a lot of weird shit out there. There really is. I mean, just in this one episode alone,
[00:23:06.560] [SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about like at least four or five, like corpse speak words. True. You know,
[00:23:12.180] [SPEAKER_03]: which one I really like? Which one? Reinvent the wheel. Oh my God. I'm like, that's a banger.
[00:23:18.320] [SPEAKER_00]: You're right. No one needs to reinvent that. We use that one so much, especially because I'm like,
[00:23:23.660] [SPEAKER_00]: graphic design, right? So we're like, oh, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Like we don't need to
[00:23:28.020] [SPEAKER_00]: create a brand new design for like every single thing. And I'm like, yeah, you're right. But also
[00:23:33.980] [SPEAKER_00]: there's some other funny ones like no one's saving lives here. True. That's like the privilege
[00:23:40.880] [SPEAKER_00]: of working for corporate America and not in healthcare or something. Yeah, very true. But
[00:23:46.580] [SPEAKER_00]: back on our topic, I do have this thought about job limbo. It's not always a bad thing, I think.
[00:23:52.760] [SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes it is really a good thing because as we mentioned, sometimes it's a signifier like,
[00:23:59.000] [SPEAKER_00]: oh, I need to reevaluate where I am right now and how I'm feeling about things. I actually strongly
[00:24:05.940] [SPEAKER_00]: believe that it's really nice to start a new job and have a clean slate every, I don't know,
[00:24:13.180] [SPEAKER_00]: X amount of years. I mean, I know some people take it to the extreme and they like to switch jobs
[00:24:18.800] [SPEAKER_00]: every one to two years. But I just feel like the concept of starting fresh at a new company is like
[00:24:25.480] [SPEAKER_00]: very liberating and very nice. Yeah, I think that's a good point. When you stay at a company
[00:24:32.340] [SPEAKER_03]: for a long time, I feel like there's just so many trailing responsibilities, even if you move
[00:24:37.020] [SPEAKER_03]: departments or move roles. It's nobody's fault that you're still probably like the historian
[00:24:44.280] [SPEAKER_03]: for that old thing. And you're the only one who knows this thing or another. So I can totally
[00:24:49.880] [SPEAKER_03]: imagine how having a clean slate could be refreshing. And plus, it's just accelerated
[00:24:55.000] [SPEAKER_03]: growth, right? Ideally in a company, even if you stay there for a long time, you would still be
[00:24:59.760] [SPEAKER_03]: growing at a pretty good pace. But when you are put onto a new team, new company, sometimes even
[00:25:06.040] [SPEAKER_03]: new industry, there's just such a bigger pool of things to learn and absorb. So you're like a dry
[00:25:12.060] [SPEAKER_00]: sponge tossed into the ocean. Yeah, and I feel like it's fun to be the newbie once in a while.
[00:25:19.800] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of thinking about this, and it's almost like you're creating your own life stages.
[00:25:26.620] [SPEAKER_00]: When we're younger, things are set. We go to elementary school for five or six years. High
[00:25:32.740] [SPEAKER_00]: school is four years. College is four to five, whatever years. But jobs, we are definitely more
[00:25:39.060] [SPEAKER_00]: in control of this because there's no set schedule. It's not like, oh, I need to be at this job for
[00:25:43.820] [SPEAKER_00]: five years to graduate or something. It's like, hey, I think I've had as much fun as I could
[00:25:51.040] [SPEAKER_00]: at this job, and now I'm ready to try something new. Go to a different industry or try a
[00:25:56.980] [SPEAKER_00]: different role or just go to a different company that I like. And I feel like that kind of lets you
[00:26:02.080] [SPEAKER_00]: create your own life stages, in a sense. It's like, oh, those years were my whatever era,
[00:26:08.820] [SPEAKER_00]: and these years are my this new company era. New era unlawed. Yeah. That is a really good point,
[00:26:15.680] [SPEAKER_03]: though, because there's no existing structure. Or even though people might preach about like,
[00:26:21.560] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, you should leave your company every X number of years, at the end of the day, it's your choice.
[00:26:26.660] [SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that's also what makes it so hard to leave sometimes,
[00:26:30.260] [SPEAKER_03]: even if you've been in job limbo for a while or feeling a little bit stagnant at your company.
[00:26:37.100] [SPEAKER_03]: It could be a scary leap to try to job hunt or look elsewhere because it's breaking your status
[00:26:44.400] [SPEAKER_03]: quo, right? That's true. Knowingly making a big change in your routine and what you know.
[00:26:48.520] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And I think it also really depends on your personality too. I think I'm the type of person
[00:26:53.660] [SPEAKER_00]: who would really enjoy trying something new, experiencing new things and learning new things.
[00:26:59.900] [SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people are just like, I don't care that much to have that kind of excitement in this
[00:27:05.920] [SPEAKER_00]: portion of my life. I'm perfectly happy with staying at this company for 10 plus years,
[00:27:13.200] [SPEAKER_00]: and there's totally nothing wrong with that. But I think for me personally, it's definitely an
[00:27:18.120] [SPEAKER_03]: exciting idea. Yeah. And I think at the end of the day, this is something that is so personal to you
[00:27:24.220] [SPEAKER_03]: where you feel like you're at your relationship with people at your company, et cetera, on how
[00:27:28.760] [SPEAKER_03]: you want to move forward from the job limbo. I feel like in my career, I have felt this kind of
[00:27:33.860] [SPEAKER_03]: on and off. Sometimes the solution is something so simple. There was this one time I was feeling
[00:27:40.780] [SPEAKER_03]: job limbo and I just felt so stuck and a little bit understimulated with what I was doing. And then
[00:27:47.960] [SPEAKER_03]: I binged succession and I felt this insane motivation, like the surge of work is life.
[00:27:56.080] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to devote my all to this company. I see. And that honestly was what fueled me for
[00:28:03.640] [SPEAKER_03]: a specific duration of time. That's insane.
[00:28:10.780] [SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you just have to watch a show that puts you in the mood to work.
[00:28:16.680] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes. Okay. I know I sound crazy, but I swear it actually works. No, I think I can feel that
[00:28:24.240] [SPEAKER_00]: because depending on what show I'm watching, sometimes I literally become the main character.
[00:28:29.160] [SPEAKER_00]: So if the show is about work, I could get into that.
[00:28:35.580] [SPEAKER_02]: It's foreplay. Get you in the right mood.
[00:28:41.400] [SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, one of the simpler ones was taking a vacation. I think it was a year or two ago.
[00:28:48.540] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, one, it was very chill during December when other people were taking vacations
[00:28:53.140] [SPEAKER_00]: and we came back for the new year and I was literally so invigorated. I was like,
[00:28:58.120] [SPEAKER_00]: I am so ready to work. I was on top of everything, above and beyond low key. I was ahead of everything
[00:29:04.200] [SPEAKER_00]: for a week. And then I took a real vacation because I didn't take a vacation in December.
[00:29:11.400] [SPEAKER_00]: I took a real vacation in February or something. And then when I came back,
[00:29:15.760] [SPEAKER_00]: I was still just so invigorated. And I was like, wow, I need to get back on that feeling.
[00:29:24.460] [SPEAKER_00]: I need a vacation, I guess.
[00:29:26.760] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, so true. Sometimes it really is all this simple stuff. There was definitely one time where
[00:29:32.820] [SPEAKER_03]: I felt so unmotivated and it was just turning into general negative feelings about work.
[00:29:39.040] [SPEAKER_03]: And then I made a really close friend at the company and then I loved work again.
[00:29:43.440] [SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the way it is, is maybe you feel these very specific feelings about work. Like,
[00:29:49.340] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, I'm burnt out and I need a day off or I feel lonely at work. But if you're really busy in your
[00:29:55.720] [SPEAKER_03]: day to day, it can just come to you in the form of one big negative cloud of emotion. You're just
[00:30:01.720] [SPEAKER_03]: generally like, oh, I dislike work or I don't want to go into work or something. So then I feel like
[00:30:06.780] [SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it's your responsibility to be your own doctor, emotions doctor. And be like, why am I
[00:30:12.600] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling like this? That's true, actually. I did receive advice to figure out first, are you
[00:30:19.920] [SPEAKER_00]: experiencing burnout? Do you need to take a moment, take a couple of days off and feel better?
[00:30:27.580] [SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you just keep figuring it out. If it wasn't burnout, then could it be this?
[00:30:33.980] [SPEAKER_00]: If it was burnout, great, you solved your problem. You know what the next steps probably should be.
[00:30:39.080] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I guess I never really thought about actually figuring out if it's
[00:30:44.580] [SPEAKER_00]: burnout or not. I just slap on a phrase and assume it's true. But maybe it was actually
[00:30:49.340] [SPEAKER_00]: something else. Maybe I'm burnt out in a different aspect of life and then that's affecting other
[00:30:54.620] [SPEAKER_03]: parts of my life. I feel like this is when something like journaling comes in so handy,
[00:30:59.340] [SPEAKER_03]: because for me, if I don't sit down and talk to someone or write about what I'm feeling,
[00:31:04.300] [SPEAKER_03]: it's just a general negative. I'm like, boo. That's just what my thoughts sound like until
[00:31:12.020] [SPEAKER_03]: I sit down and weed through them a little bit. So I think you're right. It's about identifying
[00:31:18.620] [SPEAKER_03]: the root cause and trying to attack it from there so that you have a more specific game plan.
[00:31:24.560] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Otherwise you're just like, I feel like shit. Why do I feel like shit? I don't know.
[00:31:28.460] [SPEAKER_03]: I just do. It's actually been very motivational in a sense to kind of sit down and talk through
[00:31:35.060] [SPEAKER_03]: job limbo with you, because I think with the term, this is something that maybe a lot of people have
[00:31:39.880] [SPEAKER_03]: felt before, but I had never felt like there was a true solution or a plan out from feeling job
[00:31:46.840] [SPEAKER_03]: limbo. Now that we've sat down and talked through it, I feel like there is a pretty big array of
[00:31:51.500] [SPEAKER_03]: things that you could do. Some of them being as silly as binge watching Succession and others
[00:31:57.320] [SPEAKER_03]: being a little bit more thoughtful and intuitive, like sitting down and having that honest mirror
[00:32:03.020] [SPEAKER_03]: conversation with yourself. Thank you, Krystal, for kind of decoding the phrase job limbo with
