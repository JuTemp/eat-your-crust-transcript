[00:00:00.430] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. It's been a while since we've said that. Feels a little bit weird to say, but we're happy to be back. Yeah, we took a little bit of a longer break this holiday season
[00:00:28.050] because a lot was going on. I feel like it was a good break too. It was funny because about a week ago or something, you texted me and you're like, life has gone on so long without podcast duties. Yeah, I guess for a while.
[00:00:44.090] I mean, definitely when we're in the season, podcast duties are such a normal part of our routine. But I was abroad and you were off for Christmas break and everything like that. So I was like, I can't remember what it was like to upload podcast episodes anymore.
[00:00:57.290] I definitely had that thought too. I was like, oh my God, it's like Tuesday and we're free. Yeah, exactly. I don't have plans. There were like a couple of our podcast meetings that were still on the calendar that we forgot to remove for the break.
[00:01:12.810] And then I just watched them like pop up and I was like, oh, I feel like this used to be a thing for us. But as much as it was nice having some time off, it does feel really exciting to be back.
[00:01:25.370] I feel like the first episode that we always record for the new season, we always talk about our New Year's resolutions a bit. But this time, Crystal and I were chatting a bit and she had an idea to do the resolutions in a slightly different manner this year.
[00:01:39.850] Yeah. So the typical way people kind of approach resolutions is like, what are some goals? And sometimes these goals can be pretty grandiose or sometimes they're a little vague, like this year I want to start doing this or I want to get better at this.
[00:01:56.450] But it's kind of hard to measure and stuff. So I was kind of reflecting over New Year's time and I kind of realized, and this is partially thanks to the podcast too, that I kind of had a theme unintentionally last
[00:02:12.330] year. So I was like, oh, maybe this year I'll set like a theme as well. I think last year's theme was kind of do new things, which we talked about around the beginning of the year.
[00:02:23.930] And so I was kind of thinking about what could be an appropriate theme for this year. What I came up with, it's a little vague, but it's basically to rediscover youthful energy. Kind of an interesting story, actually. I was looking through some old notes on my phone.
[00:02:42.610] I scrolled all the way to the bottom and I was like, whoa, some of these notes I kept really show the kind of person I was or like the kind of interests I had. And I don't know if I show that kind of energy in my life now.
[00:02:56.130] One note in particular was literally a list of fonts that I liked because I was so passionate about design and everything that I would literally follow new font releases. Oh, my God. I honestly did not know that this concept even existed.
[00:03:13.410] So I was like, oh, my God, like I was so excited about this stuff. Hopefully I can kind of keep a mindset to, you know, have that kind of youthful energy and passion again in things that I do. I really like that, actually.
[00:03:26.530] And I feel like the theme setting does help a lot because sometimes when the goal is a little bit too granular or too ambitious, I feel like it's hard because the weight of the responsibility of achieving that can kind of sit on your shoulders.
[00:03:41.690] But when something is a theme, I feel like it's way easier to kind of imbue that theme into different aspects of your life and just keep it in mind. Maybe when you're doing like decision making or things like that, but it's not, oh, I
[00:03:53.090] have to do this every single day. So, yeah, I can definitely appreciate that. It's kind of like in yoga when they try to make you set your intentions in the beginning of class. Yeah, true.
[00:04:04.890] But I really liked the way that you wanted to approach the New Year's resolutions this year. Personally, I thought it was a little bit funny because a couple of days before we had this chat, I had just gotten back and I was opening my new, you know, stationery
[00:04:20.850] that I got from Japan and writing down my little New Year's resolutions. Prior years, I think I've always set very specific goals. I think a common one is like, oh, this year I want to be more healthy or, you know, lose
[00:04:34.170] weight or this year I want to read more books, things like that. And those are things that I feel like I always try to do. And sometimes I achieve it, sometimes I don't.
[00:04:42.530] But it was just so much harder for me to like even think of those goals to write down this year. So I wrote down some of the most broad goals I've ever written down. And I would say that it's not even a goal.
[00:04:56.770] I almost approached it like a Taylor Swift era. Oh my God. Like 2024 is going to be the year of organizing, recalibrating and reflecting. And it will be the year of prioritizing my health and well-being. It'll be the year of love and joy.
[00:05:13.010] So I feel like it's things that I just want to focus on this year. And it's things that have existed in my life in prior years as well. But I think this year I want to focus on actually trying to improve certain aspects of my
[00:05:27.450] life instead of just fighting for survival, because lowkey, 2023 was the year of survival for me. I mean, I feel like 2023 a lot was going on in your life, especially life itself is already a lot. And then you also had wedding planning on top of that.
[00:05:43.690] And then because like you have a lot of family who's not in California, that's like a whole extra layer of just like communications and like planning and all of that kind of stuff. So yeah, it's very understandable.
[00:05:57.730] I think it does make me very excited, too, because I mean, the wedding was just such a big focus of our year last year that I felt a little bit of guilt anytime we weren't doing wedding planning stuff.
[00:06:09.370] Like I would be like, oh, fuck, like there's all this stuff I have to do that's on our list. But we're here like hanging out with friends or doing whatever, which are equally important things.
[00:06:17.450] But just in the grand scheme of things, there was like a bigger worry that I had to think about all the time. But now it feels like the end, like the boss monster or whatever was defeated.
[00:06:29.210] And now I can actually go and look at some of the smaller things in life that maybe need some work. So Casa has been a little messy. Like I've been putting off closet organization for a long time.
[00:06:40.490] And just in general, I want to set myself up for success before things are already happening. Like I don't want things to happen to me. I want myself to be able to make things happen.
[00:06:50.850] And hopefully this year there's a little bit more free headspace for me to do that. Oh, I like that. You don't want things to happen to you, but you want to make things happen. I feel like that's a really good mindset.
[00:07:02.770] I feel like what you have said just rings so true. Like a lot is happening in our lives. You know, we have work, we have social life, we have all these things that we're trying
[00:07:12.930] to balance. And kind of like what you said, a lot of the times we're just fighting to survive. And so, yeah, like what happens is just that things happen to us and we just try to survive each wave.
[00:07:25.130] Yeah. And I feel like it's one of those things where I wouldn't say in the moment last year, I felt like I was just trying to stay afloat. But I think looking back now, I can say that I was very stressed out last year and it
[00:07:37.170] was affecting different parts of my life. Not like negatively, but I mean, it's more just like I was neglecting parts of my life that I feel like needed a little bit more attention.
[00:07:47.450] So now that all of this is over, I feel like it's just such a fresh slate for me to kind of work on. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So I guess that's like because it's so broad, it's also theme-like. Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:02.090] So along with the whole theme idea, there are like kind of goals attached to it. And then there are some goals that are just standalone goals. So I made like one very, very simple goal, which was I have this like old camera
[00:08:16.970] lying around in my room and I've had it since freshman year of high school, I think. And I've been meaning to take it to a shop and see if it can be repaired. And it's literally been like over 10 years.
[00:08:30.970] So I'm like, OK, this is the year I will finally do it. And I'm giving myself the entire year to be able to accomplish that goal. I'm giving myself the entire year to be able to accomplish this one task.
[00:08:43.850] Hopefully that's not too overwhelming and I'll be able to do it. Dude, that makes me laugh, honestly, because I have a very similar goal to that where it's like this one thing and I have 365 days minus 14 days to do it because we're recording this on the 14th.
[00:09:00.610] But I've been trying to read this Dostoevsky book called The Brothers Kermizov when I was a junior in high school. Oh, my God. So that's a lot. That's like 11 years ago, which is like similar time frame to your goal.
[00:09:12.930] Yeah. And every time I start it, I get like 100 or maybe 150 pages in around that point of the book. The like priest character gives a 50 page sermon like in the book. So every time I read it, I get to that point and I'm like, I can't do it.
[00:09:29.890] And the book is fairly long. It's like eight hundred and fifty pages, maybe something like that. I'm like, OK, I have to read through 50 pages of this sermon and all the rest of the book. Like I just can't.
[00:09:39.570] But I think this year I'm finally going to tackle this and I will no longer be like, oh, I've been meaning to get around to it, but I'm going to do it sometime. Like this is the time that I will get around to it.
[00:09:52.930] OK, but like, is it bad if you just skipped the sermon? Like, is it important to the story? I guess like a normal person would probably just read like the synopsis or something. I think in my head, I was just like, oh, I need to like 100 percent
[00:10:07.250] completion. You know, this book. Yeah. That's why I'm skimming. Yeah. OK, I believe you can do it, especially if you travel this year. I feel like in my experience, reading during traveling is very, very productive. Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:22.810] I guess I also mentioned I have some small goals tied to my theme. So as I mentioned, my theme is kind of rediscovering that like youth. I guess the way that I'm approaching it is I'm thinking back on things that I enjoyed doing when I was younger.
[00:10:40.290] So one example could be reading, watching movies, stuff like that. I'm just kind of like thinking back to these things that used to bring joy and kind of revisiting them. If it makes sense to if it's possible, if it still brings joy, then, you know,
[00:10:55.490] keep doing that. But if it no longer brings joy, then kind of just accept that and like move on. I like that. Do you think you'll have like a systematic approach to it or are you
[00:11:06.050] just going to be like, oh, let's indulge in these things and just test things out as it comes? I think definitely more as it comes. So one thing I've already kind of started on it. So like one thing that I'm doing this year is I'm using a website
[00:11:22.850] to keep track of every single movie I watched this year. So then I think one thing is it'll be cool at the end of the year to look back and be like, oh, these are all the movies I watched this year.
[00:11:32.570] And like, what did I like and what did I not like? But also, I guess it's a more physical way of tracking like, oh, I'm doing this thing that I enjoy and I'm not forgetting about it, I guess. And then another thing is I've started reading.
[00:11:47.610] I picked up a book that I haven't read on my bookshelf and I just started reading it. Nice. There's definitely such a joy and almost like an incentive to like cataloging stuff that you've read or watched, because I feel like there's so much
[00:12:02.050] satisfaction in marking something as like read or watched. So maybe that'll also be additional motivation for you to kind of keep up with the school too. And I guess like, I don't know. Do you feel like you get very reflective and thoughtful towards the end of the year?
[00:12:18.770] I think yes, but when I travel, it's definitely a lot more subdued because I'm like, oh, you know, involved in the chaos of like traveling or exploring somewhere new. But I always have the urge to like sit down with a pen and paper and reflect on
[00:12:32.210] everything that has happened in the prior year. Yeah, I feel like I get really reflective too. So I think like cataloging some of the stuff that you've done over the year is really
[00:12:42.690] nice because when I get like, you know, kind of reflective and I'm like thinking back on the year, it's nice to have something physical to look at, whether it's like a list or I don't know, like journal entries or things like that.
[00:12:56.530] So I think that is another pro to the whole cataloging this stuff. Ooh, actually, that's a really good point. And it kind of reminds me of this conversation that I had over Christmas dinner this year. We were catching up with some of James's family friends.
[00:13:13.370] We were trying to figure out two years ago on Christmas, did we grab dinner together or did we not? And it was kind of hard for us to remember exactly where the mom was two
[00:13:22.770] years ago. The only thing that we found as like physical evidence of us eating dinner together two years prior was through a photo that she had taken. It wasn't a group photo or anything, but it was like a photo of some dessert that she
[00:13:37.090] had made. And then that triggered all of our memory to be like, oh, yeah, like I remember eating this dessert with you. Like, I totally remember this. And then that's when we were all like in agreement about what happened.
[00:13:48.850] But it made me think a lot, actually, because right now, you know, we're like 27 turning 28 this year. And already I was like kind of struggling remembering what happened two years ago. And it was something so random that ended up triggering our memory and not
[00:14:05.170] even like an exact record of what happened. And I feel like cataloging things like books and movies can actually help with that, because for me, when I look back on my Goodreads, I'm like, oh, I read this book during
[00:14:16.170] like my sad era because this time of the year I remember reading this and thinking, oh, this is so relevant to me right now. Or like, oh, I remember reading this book and you know, so and so came over and we talked about it or things like that.
[00:14:27.650] So sometimes our memories are just tied to all these things that you're cataloging for such a different reason, but it still triggers all these thoughts. Oh, my God. That is a really good point.
[00:14:37.930] Yeah, because I'm also making sure like when I am recording like the movies I watch or the books I read that I put like the date that I finished it. So, yeah, it'll be really interesting to see what gets tied to what, you know, what
[00:14:53.410] memory gets tied to what movie or book. I guess it's kind of like that thing where people say if you use a different perfume on like a trip, then it'll make it easier to remember.
[00:15:05.410] Like next time you pick up that perfume, you're like, oh, this smells like my trip to Europe. Dude, yeah. And actually, it honestly made me want to take more photos as well, too, because I was
[00:15:17.690] like, damn, I can't believe this is the only photo any of us had from that one Christmas dinner. I just feel like the older I get, the less I want things to like slip through my memory and I just want to like record everything.
[00:15:30.290] Maybe this is why parents always want to take like a billion photos of their kids. Oh my God, we are becoming the Asian parents. Oh God. So you also mentioned that your kind of broader goal slash theme this year is to
[00:15:44.570] get organized and I guess like cataloging kind of ties in with being organized. Do you have any other smaller goals tied to that? Yes, definitely. So I think one of the things that I wanted to really focus on this year was going more
[00:16:03.250] internal. So definitely the cataloging thing is a huge part of this because I want to record stuff, remember stuff, just make sure that I'm appreciating and celebrating like even the small victories in life, aka like finishing a book or watching a movie, but
[00:16:19.610] also making sure that all of these like little obsessions or like eras that I have even throughout the year, I'm recording. So I made this page on my new journal and it's titled My Monthly Obsessions of 2024. Oh my God, I love that.
[00:16:35.970] Right. And I feel like it's vague enough to where like many things can be categorized as an obsession. Like sometimes I'll just listen to one song over and over or right now I'm in my Snoopy era. There's like this green puppet thing on TikTok I've been seeing everywhere.
[00:16:50.370] And that's like one of the cutest things I've ever seen. I'm also obsessed with that. Dude, that thing is actually it's from a Canadian kids show. So a lot of people on the comments of that are like, oh my God, I don't know what this
[00:17:02.650] is, but like why do I relate so hard? And I was like, wait, I know what this is. Like I watched this when I was a kid. No way. I had no idea. Oh, so funny.
[00:17:13.450] But yeah, it's just all these things where I feel like I'm obsessed with something for like a week or like a month. And then I completely forget that I ever had that obsession because something new comes along and I just want to like jot that down somewhere.
[00:17:27.810] Yeah, I think that's actually such a good idea because if anything, you can always go back and be like, oh, that's right. I was super obsessed with this. Like maybe I should revisit it or like, you know, see if there's any updates in that community or something.
[00:17:42.050] So it could be like a fun walk down memory lane in the future. Yeah, definitely. I guess the flip side of all of this cataloging stuff is I also just want to be a
[00:17:54.330] little bit more honest with myself and able to write down things in my journal that maybe 2023 me would not have wanted documented somewhere. But I saw this concept on TikTok. It was actually a concept about journaling where it said you should be able to do
[00:18:11.810] whatever you want in your journal, whether that's like get literal scraps of paper or whatever and like paste it in just because you like the aesthetic of it. Get like random receipts and paste that in if you don't want to write a whole thing out
[00:18:23.210] about the restaurant that you ate at, things like that. And I was like, that makes total sense because who the fuck is reading this journal? Like literally no one except myself.
[00:18:31.370] So I don't know why I'm like I have to upkeep this and in a perfect way and make this all like that. It's like it really doesn't matter. And I'm either going to read it like once a year or like once every five years or it's
[00:18:42.290] going to be like stashed in some closet box somewhere anyway. So this year I decided to abandon this mentality of like a perfect journal and like an emotional journal and just like be like a trash journaler, you know?
[00:18:56.290] I'm just imagining you making like the most perfect journal as if it's about to get published. Dude, pretty much. Yeah. And now you're like, wait, literally no one is reading this. I don't even have an editor. Like, okay. And here's like the most ridiculous thing.
[00:19:12.610] So I bought a really nice journal years ago and I was like, oh my God, this is going to be like my daily journal. I'm so excited to write in it, etc., etc.
[00:19:21.330] I was writing in it recently and I noticed I just hit like a little bit past the halfway mark. And this journal I bought in fucking 2016. And I think that's also a part of why I feel like these journals have so much weight and
[00:19:34.170] permanence to it, because I've been working on one journal for eight years. So to move myself even further away from this seriousness and gravity of journaling, I bought like these 20 page journals basically or like 50 page journals. So it's like truly I have to swap it out mid-year anyway.
[00:19:51.610] Yeah. So I'm like, you know what? I'm not going to fall for the same bullshit that I always use to trick myself every year. This year I will fight back. Wait, that's such a good point. Okay. Have you ever finished a notebook? I don't think I have.
[00:20:08.770] If I have, it's because I like forced it. But it's so hard. Like it's so rare, right? Yeah, I think there's maybe only like two or three times that I've ever like truly finished a notebook.
[00:20:20.770] Right. Which is so crazy to think because I am buying more than two or three journals like a year. The amount of pristine notebooks that I'm like, I'm like not ready to write in this. Yeah, it's too perfect right now.
[00:20:35.090] Yeah, I think it's like in years where maybe I'm a little bit more busy or like it's more chaotic. Like last year I was able to get by with like the same BS that I always feed myself. But this year I was like, you know what?
[00:20:47.770] I'm not going to do this anymore. Let's just kind of do better and like just be better. And actually one of the eras that I've deemed 2024 as is I want this to be the year
[00:21:00.130] of love and joy, which in some way I feel like it's a little ironic because last year I got married and had a wedding. And, you know, a lot of our friends, including you, spent certain days or like weeks
[00:21:12.770] of the year, like really celebrating me and James' love and all of that, which is really great. But this year I want that love to come from me and go externally. So I was like, you know what? I want to reach out to friends more.
[00:21:24.730] I want to be more of a proactive texter, which is something that I really struggle with. So just like these small things I feel like are easier to do. So that's one of the things that I have this year. Hmm, I like that.
[00:21:38.250] And hopefully this year there's like a lot more room for you to be able to do this. Yeah. I want to start like hosting stuff again. Maybe not as to the extent that I used to, but definitely like big holidays and stuff. I feel like is doable.
[00:21:52.490] So. Wow. How wholesome. We're so wholesome. I know. You know, I really like that era theme that you came up for yourself. And I think I have something that's kind of similar. So we haven't really talked about this on the podcast before, but I am currently in a
[00:22:16.810] kind of newer relationship. And there's been a lot that I've learned from it already in like the short-ish time that it's been going on so far. And I feel like it's a focus that I would want to have in this new year to continuously
[00:22:37.850] improve and learn from it. It's so interesting because we're both in therapy. And we talk to our therapists about how we communicate with each other. And then they'll often give feedback or suggestions or just be like, you know, good
[00:22:56.450] job or whatever. Then what's funny is actually we will discuss it amongst ourselves. Like, oh, you know, this is something that I talked to my therapist about. Or like, you know, these are things that me and my therapist decided that I should work
[00:23:10.050] on in the context of the relationship or even just other things. It's like very fascinating to see an action. And also there's a really funny side to this as well, which is I think his therapist likes
[00:23:25.690] me. So I'm like, oh my God, this is like great because now I have two therapists to impress. Wait, yeah, you're right. Your therapy trait is to like always want to impress the therapist.
[00:23:39.250] Yeah. So other than that, it's just like a lot to grow from even more than I realized before. I think before in previous relationships or just like not in relationships, I'm like, oh yeah, you know, like we're growing, we're learning here.
[00:23:57.130] But then now I'm like, whoa, this is like another I don't know, there's like another layer to it. And I feel like there's more nuance and then more like stuff that you can learn from just because it's like so I don't know, like interweave.
[00:24:12.970] Wow. Well, I really love that. It's also kind of funny because it's kind of like couples therapy, except it's not. It's just like individual therapy and that you happen to talk about your relationship, which is just hilarious.
[00:24:25.610] It's funny too sometimes because when me and my friend talk about it, I'm just imagining in my head like, wow, we get to talk about this stuff, but our therapists don't know each other. Like they're probably foaming at the mouth to talk to each
[00:24:42.290] other. Dude, they're probably all up on your social media. Like who is she dating? Yeah, that's that's really cool, though. And I'm also interested one day to like pick your brain on, I guess, relationships that you enter at a slightly older age.
[00:25:01.490] So James and I started dating in college, and I feel like actually a lot of our friends either started dating in college or maybe towards a couple years after college or things like that. I just wonder if there's some sort of difference that you notice.
[00:25:14.090] Maybe there's a little bit more like experience and learnings that you come to the table with for this kind of relationship. And I would have to think that it's like, I don't know, maybe different challenges, different rewards and all of that based on the age.
[00:25:28.010] Oh my God, for sure. I have a lot to say. So stay tuned, I guess. But yeah, I really love that for you as a goal. I think also in terms of the bigger stages of life or like life at a bigger picture,
[00:25:44.770] even certain relationships can be different eras or at least start or end different eras of your life. So it'll be interesting to see how that expands further this year. Yeah, definitely. Speaking of relationships, I also feel like my brother and I or have been maybe even
[00:26:04.410] unintentionally building on our relationship in the past couple of years. I guess I have noticed that more recently and I feel like it's a good thing and I like the momentum that it's had.
[00:26:19.090] So I'm like, oh, that's something to keep an eye on and hopefully continue to grow and try not to neglect. Oh, I love that. Sometimes it's like the people closest to us, I feel like that don't make the New Year's resolutions list or something.
[00:26:36.090] But yeah, definitely family is key too. I actually called my dad like a week ago and I've spoken on this podcast before that I like rarely just call him. I'll usually call my mom, she'll pass the phone over or something.
[00:26:49.930] But I called him and we chatted and a couple of days in Seoul, just him and myself and James got food and whatnot. And I was like, OK, I can keep working on this every year. I guess that's a goal for myself as well. Yeah.
[00:27:04.010] Oh, so is James in your New Year's goals or anything? Yes. Oh, really, Q? I think he's part of. OK, I would say he's part of the love and joy part. So I think because last year it was so much about like me and James banding together to
[00:27:21.690] like bring people together for our wedding or things like that. It was very much like us against the world vibes. But now I feel like we can work on our world and he's very happy that I'm going to start like cleaning and like organizing the house this year.
[00:27:37.810] So he's a part of two goals, the love and joy and also like the cleaning the house part. Wow. Well, how does it feel to enter the new year as a freshly married couple? So I think it's very different for me.
[00:27:53.770] I actually feel like being married is completely different. And, you know, last year I think it was really just myself and maybe like one other of our friends who was engaged. But this year I think a lot more of my friends are getting engaged.
[00:28:08.970] And I was actually hanging out with one of my really close friends yesterday. She was saying that it pretty much feels the same for her, except for maybe like a couple of small details.
[00:28:18.130] But for me, I felt like every stage, like getting engaged, getting married, like felt so worlds different. I was kind of like, well, I really guess it is dependent on like how emotional or how
[00:28:29.410] sensitive or like how you choose to see these things like love and marriage and whatnot. Yeah. I think now that I'm a married woman, I do feel like I have to act a little bit differently.
[00:28:41.690] I'm like, maybe I should stop being so immature and like crazy all the time. No, that's OK. No, that's OK. You can keep doing that. Wait, I saw the funniest meme. It was like this Hello Kitty all tucked into bed, very happy looking with like a giant
[00:28:59.930] water bottle next to it and a book in its hand. And it was like me after being insane all day. Wait, that's literally me. But yeah, I think I have mentioned on this podcast before that I tend to like structure.
[00:29:15.050] I like clearly defined roles and things like that. And I feel like now that I have this role of a wife, I feel like I have like bigger shoes to fill. So I'm excited to see if I'm able to be the sort of wife that younger me would
[00:29:30.130] have wanted. Just work on things in a different way. I don't know. Like I don't want to feel so old. Not to say that married people are old, but I do feel a little bit older than I'm married. Maybe the right word is mature. OK, yeah, you're right.
[00:29:45.330] I have to stop thinking I'm old. I need to be like, I'm mature now. But yeah, I think it's been really fun. And, you know, every moment feels more special now that I can be like, oh my God, this is
[00:29:55.330] our first time doing whatever as a married couple. So it's been a lot of many celebrations. Yeah. Aww. That's nice to hear. You're finding a lot of joy in being married. And even though I guess base level or like on the surface, not much has really changed.
[00:30:11.570] But it's kind of like you're both doubling down, like, OK, now I need to like do even more to fill up this role and be the best that I can and continue to like mature and learn together. Yeah, definitely.
[00:30:27.210] And it is a little bit interesting to see what kind of advice I get from family now, too. So when I was in Korea, I felt like I got a lot of like, OK, now that you're married, let me tell you about pregnancy kind of advice.
[00:30:43.570] And I think actually since I've been like, you know, looking forward to pregnancy, not like immediately, but just it's like a part of my future life plans already. It wasn't like overbearing or anything.
[00:30:55.850] But, you know, sometimes I just forget that these older women in our life have gone through what we will or might go through already. And they have all these like words of wisdom or life advice that they just choose not
[00:31:08.490] to share with us because maybe we're not ready. Right. So on some ways, I was like, actually, I really appreciate that, that they waited for these things until after I was married where I can kind of absorb and understand this information more.
[00:31:22.170] And on the other hand, I was just like, wow, I can't believe you guys went through all of this stuff. And I just had no idea. Wow. It's like the doors have been opened for you.
[00:31:31.930] You get to see the other side of all this stuff that we don't know. Yeah. And low key, I feel like now that I'm married, I have more access to like grown up tea because they were spilling some tea now that I'm married.
[00:31:44.410] And I was like, holy shit. Yeah, that's true, actually, because now they're probably like, oh, they're like adults now. You know, they're married. They know what we go through and they know things that we know.
[00:31:57.290] Exactly. It's like easier for them to see you as somewhat of an equal. Yeah, that was kind of exciting as well. I was like, wow, this is like grown up wives gossip. Yeah. Wife tea. Wow, that's exciting.
[00:32:12.970] Do you feel like you're getting invited more to like dinners and stuff? But it's like your family, friend, parents? I think a little bit. And it's kind of funny because I feel like the other people who also get invited to these
[00:32:25.290] things are like other married couples as well. So I'm just like, oh, my God. Now I can't be like, oh, which of the kids are coming? Because it's really just like the married couples. Oh, my God.
[00:32:36.530] I remember there was this one really funny comment someone made in our group chat. It was like a few days after your wedding and you and James went out to get dinner with like a couple of close family friends, except it was just the like parents.
[00:32:49.130] Right. And then someone was like, wow, what a cute triple date. Like just three married couples having a wonderful dinner together. Dude. Yeah, it's a little bit wild being invited to these things.
[00:33:02.570] And I think it'll take some getting used to because I still feel like such a child. But the wedding band on my finger says otherwise, maybe. So I should probably grow up a little bit.
[00:33:12.810] Or or you can just tuck it away in the safe and and live your happiest childlike life. That's true. You know, jokes aside about, I guess, the married life. Throwing a wedding last year did really make me reflect on the concept of like
[00:33:28.650] celebrating stuff, which I know is very vague. But it obviously took us a lot of time and effort and honestly money to throw something so big. But it was so crazy seeing all these people that we've met and known at
[00:33:43.370] different ages of our life coming together to like help celebrate us and just have fun with us and enjoy the food and wine and whatnot. And it made me think there's actually a lot of things that are worth celebrating in
[00:33:55.570] life, not just marriage, that we don't end up doing these big celebrations for. Like a common one I feel like we do is birthdays. But sometimes people are like, oh, I don't really want to do something crazy or whatever, which is definitely fair.
[00:34:08.650] But I kind of felt like to the extent that I can, I want to continue having fun celebrations and nights of appreciation for people and not just wait for like weddings and then like, that's it. You know what I mean? Yeah.
[00:34:23.890] You know, there's so much joy that can be shared. Not that you always have to throw a huge party for it, but maybe in the day to day, we don't put in the effort or like forget to carve out time for these things.
[00:34:36.290] And it's like joy and love that could be celebrated more. Yeah. I don't know if that made any sense. No, it makes total sense. And I'm so glad you brought that up because I actually saw this TikTok recently
[00:34:47.770] that kind of made me think along similar lines as what you just said. It was basically someone hosting like a, I don't even know what to call it, like a binge-a-thon for like singles inferno. Oh.
[00:34:59.850] And I was like, dude, this is like something that is honestly really easy and can be really intimate for, you know, a friend group, you know, just have a bunch of snacks, tell everyone to bring their own snacks and then just like sit down and watch a
[00:35:13.570] bunch of, you know, shitty reality TV that makes everyone laugh and have a good time. And I was like, wow, that's such a good vibe. And it's definitely something that I thought like, oh, this is very doable for us.
[00:35:25.530] Maybe it's something that I can think about doing more in the new year as well. Just like not everything has to be super big and sometimes the smaller, easier. Oh my God. I'm about to use some corporate word like low-hanging fruit.
[00:35:39.770] It's just like it sometimes it really reaps a lot of benefits. Yeah. And people celebrate like the funniest shit. Like I saw on TikTok someone threw a funeral for their boobs because they were getting a boob job. So it was like RIP whoever's old boobs.
[00:35:56.770] And I was like, this is so funny. And it honestly is kind of a big event in life to get like a boob job. And, you know, I feel like there's been things in our friend group even that have been
[00:36:06.810] bigger things that we maybe just didn't have the time or like energy to celebrate. So I feel like big or small, we can always use some sort of excuse to have these gatherings. So I'm excited for, you know, more friendship connections, more celebrations of
[00:36:22.250] whatever and just more fun nights in the new year. Agreed. Well, now that we feel all warm and fuzzy, let's wrap up and get excited for the new year. So thank you everyone for listening to us and embarking on this new year with us.
