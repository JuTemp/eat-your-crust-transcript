[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal and I'm Kate Welcome back Kate last time episode 216 meeting new people which was a fun episode and I feel like very Relevant, you know
[00:00:26.180] It's hard to meet new people at our age and I still often think back that episode actually what we talked about Whenever I like meeting new people But before we get to today's topic
[00:00:37.880] We do have a slang word to discuss and this one is kind of fun because it's kind of like an evolution of one of the previous words that we've talked about before and the previous phrase is Let them cook
[00:00:51.720] Today's word is cooked. And so in like a sentence, I guess it would be like Wow right now in the NBA Finals Mavs are so cooked So the meaning of cooked is basically like you're screwed you're not in a good place It's looking pretty doomed for you
[00:01:13.660] Confused me because I'd only heard of like the word cook in slang terms being used as like, oh, let him cook Let them cook right? So it's like usually a good thing. Like this is something good that is about to happen
[00:01:24.940] So I actually hear like the positive version of that which is like bro really Cooked like he did this said cooking that we allowed him to do I actually haven't heard it used in like the oh like oh like he's cooked now
[00:01:41.460] Like this is a bad thing for this person It is so funny that it's like a dual meaning Almost exact opposite meanings like actually but how I've been seeing it often lately is Sort of like a way to roast yourself so on tik-tok sometimes on your feed
[00:01:58.220] There's like weird videos that come up right the comments will always be like, oh I'm cooked. I find this funny It's so over basically. So then I feel like that's like a really funny way of
[00:02:08.060] Joking about it, but I can totally see how it can be confusing because it can mean both things at the same time Yes, and I just have to use context clues. So whether this is a positive thing or a negative thing Yeah
[00:02:19.740] Yeah, I guess it is very heavily context based now in my mind when I think of cooked I kind of think of it attached to the previous like oh let them cook. Yeah kind of thing
[00:02:31.500] So I think oh, it's like overcooked now. So that's why it's like done. It's over makes me think of the game overcooked Which is really fun I find it kind of funny too because
[00:02:43.900] Cooked or like let him cook or even I'm cooked. I feel like is a slightly more Male leaning term it's not for the girls in the games Like it's more for like the dudes, you know who watch sports or play games or whatnot in a stereotypical sense
[00:02:58.100] And I'm just like why are these guys making jokes about cooking because I feel like Women are the ones cooking. Oh my god. That's why it's slang right? Because it's a foreign new concept It's like newly introduced Oh my god
[00:03:15.380] But that's such a good point because I feel like you're right when I think of this like slang term and the original one like let Them cook. I do mostly think of it in the context of sports and like games
[00:03:26.380] And that's where I see a lot of this kind of like specific slang and like tick-tock I see more of instead of saying like let them cook. It's like oh this person ate true
[00:03:36.660] Now when I do hear a lot from my co-worker, yeah, who's very young like fresh out of college Yeah, actually two areas of my life where I get my slang from are either from my co-worker who is young or from my now
[00:03:49.540] Fiancee who actually like isn't it like eSports and everything? So streamers will always like introduce newest terms and then he'll start using it in his speech and I'll just be like what is that? But it's funny to see how this word I have
[00:04:07.340] Seen used in both from my friend who is my co-worker and then also Brian who is using it more than like the negative term and my friend who's using more like the positive term Yeah, I feel like streamers and twitch. That's where a lot of
[00:04:21.780] interesting slang originates from Yeah, I can't think of any of the top of my head right now every time that gets introduced to me I'm like, I'm not following the thought process of like how you came to this term being what you're going to use
[00:04:36.060] Right. I feel like some of the more outrageous things come from streams and stuff I mean one that I can think of which we've often mentioned as you know, the biggest mystery slang is scooby-doo. Oh I've only ever heard it through streams and like gaming kind of stuff
[00:04:53.020] So that's just where I assume it originates from but I'm like, yeah, they always have the most outrageous slang dude Have you watched the video? I have not the scooby-doo toilet one. I have not it's cursed
[00:05:07.060] It's just like a man's head in the toilet and like he moves erratically is what I've seen I'm like I've seen enough Interesting. Well, I think this one ranks pretty high in my opinion of slang
[00:05:19.300] That's easy to use especially because you can use it on both ends of the spectrum But I guess slang words aside. Let's jump into our actual topic today, which is double dates I want to talk about success strategies for double dates whether we prefer them or not
[00:05:35.300] And just general things about going on a date with another couple So let's start with do you guys like double dates and why or why not? I Definitely love double dates for me
[00:05:48.340] It's more just like a fun way to hang out with my friends who happen to be coupled I guess it's just like just the nature of the activity that we're doing, right? so I hang out with my two good friends Daniel and Esther a lot with Brian and
[00:06:02.500] We'll do things like go on grocery runs. We'll eat out We'll play and do volleyball together, but it's more of a group activity with everyone else, but we'll watch movies Sometimes we'll just hang out each other's houses
[00:06:14.340] So we hang out with them a lot in all different like areas are different types of activities that we do I wouldn't consider all of them double dates, right? so if it's something that I Perceive as an activity I would only do with Brian
[00:06:32.900] Then that would kind of just be like a double date Like if it's something more like a special occasion, but if it's something as simple as like doing chores
[00:06:42.060] That's not a double date. Like sometimes we'll get groceries together because that's the majority of my experience with hanging out with another couple I don't feel as though it is a double date. Just like I'm hanging out with my friends who are also couples
[00:06:56.900] So I guess for it to qualify as a double date in your mind it first and foremost has to qualify as a date Yes. Yeah, okay. I think that makes sense Meals are more often potential double dates. Yeah, so for meals
[00:07:11.260] It's like if I'm just gonna go grab like some to-go and then we're gonna take it and eat it at our house And it's just the four of us and we're just watching some TV
[00:07:18.900] Like I would do that on a casual like weekday with Brian. That's not a date to me So therefore if I'm doing this with Daniel and Esther then it's also not a date
[00:07:27.980] but if we're eating a fancy meal and we're celebrating like their birthdays or we're doing something like oh Let's try that new fancy place and we get up and we get dressed up. I would consider that a date
[00:07:40.220] Yeah, I think that distinction makes total sense to me too because there are things that you can do with your SO And it just feels so everyday and routine and then when you set out to go on a real date I think the mindset feels completely different
[00:07:55.340] It's not always just the clothes or like just the environment or the setting but it's like I wake up and I'm like, oh my god Like today we're going on a date and it feels so much more special
[00:08:03.460] So it makes sense that that would translate into the double date realm as well Yeah, I guess I never really thought about what defines a double date versus not because you're right. I think now as More and more of our friends find partners
[00:08:18.440] It's more common that we end up hanging out and it just happens that you know, everyone's SOs are there So I guess you know in those situations It's not necessarily like a double date or a triple date or whatever X amount of people
[00:08:31.640] It's more just like oh we're hanging out and everyone's just here Yeah, and like having a double date is more like intentional. I would say Yeah, I guess the same way that you would define what constitutes a date with your significant other
[00:08:48.120] The same type of logic I would apply to is that a date with the other couple as well? but it does get like confusing at times because I'll have friends who are couples and friends who are single too and
[00:09:00.840] Basically anytime that I hang out with like the only the friends who are coupled the single friends will be like Oh you guys are on a date It's like I don't feel like we are on a date like we're doing something very simple
[00:09:11.320] Like I wouldn't consider this a date with Ryan. Therefore. I wouldn't consider it a double date with my other couple of friends So I always thought that was interesting and they have told us before
[00:09:22.000] They're like, oh you guys are they're planning a triple date. They're planning a double date. Like we must not impede It's like no, it's totally fine. If you guys wanted to come that's that's okay
[00:09:32.680] You don't you guys don't have to feel like this is like a special occasion But I think because it is just like couples they feel as if they cannot impede It's probably their excuse so they don't feel like the you know X the wheel
[00:09:48.560] I do think like visually at least when I see two couples hanging out on Instagram stories or something I always process that as like, oh, that's a double date
[00:10:02.320] I think I'm guilty of that. Yeah, I think there's also we're kind of talking about how the boundaries can feel fuzzy Sometimes I feel like there's been many times where I'm hanging out with my friends and then halfway through I'm like, whoa Is this a double date? Oh
[00:10:17.640] That's interesting. Would you consider like when when me and Brian come over to your place and we're playing board games Do you consider that a double date? So I actually didn't until we sat down to record this episode today and I was like, oh, oh my god
[00:10:32.320] Recurring double date. I have always considered that No way Cuz I'm sure like juicy shares stuff with you and one of those being we play board games
[00:10:43.240] Yeah, I often that her place. You always thought that was like a double date. Yeah in my mind. I was like, oh, that's so cute They have like a scheduled double date Like a recurring double date as you as you come But then on the flip side
[00:10:56.460] Crystal you and your boyfriend and us like we go out to play like golf sometimes and then grab a meal or something afterwards I don't think I ever considered that a double date until today as well
[00:11:08.760] Well, I think someone once said it's almost like we're on a double date golfing together and then after someone said that I was like Oh, I guess this is like a double date, huh? When you're in the hangout where there are two couples
[00:11:22.920] You don't feel as if it is a double date because at that stage You feel like these are just three other friends of mine and we're all enjoying the same activity But then when you brought up that example of like anytime I perceive two other couples hanging out
[00:11:38.020] It's like that's immediately a double date. So it's like you don't feel like it and in my head I didn't feel like as if it is because I feel like when I think of the word double date immediately
[00:11:50.080] It's like there's a romantic element to it. But when I'm actually on those double dates I don't feel the romance It's just friendship. I'm like, it's just mention That's actually a really good point. Like our double dates supposed to be romantic cuz it's like
[00:12:07.680] Realistically, it's just a bunch of friends right who happened to be like dating each other Hey when I'm at juicy's house playing clank, like I'm not thinking about romance Between the two couples. Yeah, there's no romance just like sportsmanship or Like
[00:12:27.040] Now that I'm thinking about it, maybe double dates aren't necessarily supposed to be romantic Maybe they're just supposed to be fun. I think I kind of see it like it's not necessarily always romantic but it establishes an arena where
[00:12:41.520] Romance is allowed as in if you're hanging out with friends and it's like a mixed group or whatever I feel like PDA is kind of like oh, this is like a little much but I feel like in a double date setting
[00:12:53.040] It's slightly more okay because you're both couples and it's sort of like fair game Not that it's like find a makeout with your partner Your friends who are a couple hey watch this Like holding hands and stuff I feel like is more okay
[00:13:12.480] Yeah, I guess cuz like you establish like oh, these are two couples hanging out together So it has more of that we all know we're couples and we all know there might be some sort of potential PDA I like that definition me and Brian have never truly
[00:13:28.600] like very much PDA throughout the majority of our relationship and Honestly, we didn't even question it until our friend Daniel started dating Esther So Gisu do you remember we went to Hawaii like a little while back and it was me and Brian you and James and Daniel
[00:13:49.840] But it was like that was just like it felt like a friend's trip because we made it a friend's trip, right? We focused on the activities and the competitiveness and in the things that we were doing
[00:14:00.680] we made bets like we make fun of each other like it was very much the way that we define friendship and We saw that and without the trip and so when Daniel started dating Esther after this trip she actually
[00:14:13.680] talked to him later on because we had gone to like a restaurant and Brian and I were walking in front Daniel Esther walking behind and she noticed that me and Brian weren't holding hands
[00:14:24.800] So she asked him just like why don't Kate like weren't they dating for like eight years like at this point Like why aren't they holding hands? Like why aren't they like linking arms, you know? Why don't they call each other, babe?
[00:14:36.880] We were just like, oh, I don't think about that when like What were in these settings and then yeah She is definitely somebody who is very comfortable with holding hands calling her significant other, babe
[00:14:50.620] She's very like she hugs like all her friends and she has made me more of a hugger as well from hanging out with her so I thought that was
[00:14:59.680] Interesting like the PDA is allowed but because I'm not used to it. I'm like, I know it's allowed but I'm still not But that's a good point cuz I think all three of us here are like not PDA
[00:15:15.840] So I'm like I'm thinking about I'm like, yeah PDA is totally allowed in double dates but like me personally not engaging But That's what Jesus point is, right? Like you don't have to necessarily do it
[00:15:29.520] It is just allowed and because it is a lot then that's what's part of making a double date. Yeah It's so funny too cuz for me personally I'm recalling like a very specific memory that I have
[00:15:42.840] Where I remember we were hanging out with some friends and then we ended up like splitting off and we're like walking to our cars whatever and then the group that was left was just like maybe two or three couples and
[00:15:53.880] Then the couple that was walking in front of us They were holding hands and then I was like, oh shit. Does that mean like me and James can hold hands? You know on our dates like away from our friends and stuff
[00:16:05.360] We're affectionate and we like hold hands and whatnot but around other people we definitely shy away from doing that But once I saw the other couple hold hands, I'm like, oh my god, it's fucking fair game, dude That's exactly what happened
[00:16:18.240] Because she well actually the second part of that story was she's like, why don't you hold my hand So Daniel and Daniel's like dude, I don't know came by never hold hands
[00:16:33.440] So she's like why would like to hold hands so now they hold hands and now me and Brian sometimes holding our hands more Especially when we're hanging out with them because once we see that it is like oh and like it's totally fine for us to do that
[00:16:45.960] We're like, okay, like we can do if we want to if we don't we don't Esther's got great sway. I know the leadership But dude, I don't think I've ever seen Jisoo and James You went to our wedding. Oh you guys held hands. Oh, I would hope so
[00:17:03.920] I Like wait, are you sure you know? You stood next to each other. I'm not sure if hands were touching But I think you know double dates being Okay, this is gonna sound a little odd but double dates feeling like a safe space for couples to be affectionate
[00:17:26.600] I think is very true But it also kind of enables like certain conversation topics or like vibes to also come up one example that I can think of is I feel like when you're on a double date you can kind of talk about
[00:17:39.800] Fights that you might have had or like, you know recent like couple struggles because you know, the other couple would get it. Mm-hmm Definitely. I think that's a very fun topic
[00:17:50.320] But I'm also like a bit afraid to like bring it up too because I'm like I don't want to cause Issues with like this other couple But when you or James who have been like dating for as long as like me and Brian have I'm like
[00:18:05.080] I'm gonna ask away like, you know, I think it's easier to dive into Deeper topics like how do you resolve fights? You know when somebody is acting this way in your relationship How do you deal with that?
[00:18:18.600] It's easier to ask and present those questions when I know that the other couples relationship has been Secure and like like you're married, you know Like there's no other like other status and then I'm like
[00:18:30.720] I'm not afraid to like ask these questions or present them to you like you're James But if it's somebody who's like just started date if my friend just started dating somebody else
[00:18:38.800] Then I'm probably not gonna ask those questions, right? I'm not gonna be like, oh doesn't it annoy you and Like I'm not trying to start a fight but I think what's a fun thing is like finding the
[00:18:55.240] similarities between the way I act in my relationship and in my friends, so I think a good example is me and Brian versus Jess and Jesse So there's a lot of similarities between my friend Jess and my and my friend Brian my fiance
[00:19:12.120] they have a lot of like similar personality traits in the way that they deal with conflict and So I will see similarities between when Jess is like talking about her relationship issues. I can explain Jesse's side
[00:19:26.240] Because I have been on the side where like Brian is upset like Jess is upset in the same way So I think that's like an interesting topic It's like who in the relationship is more like this who in the relationship is more like that
[00:19:39.720] I don't know if you guys have ever noticed that between like your couple friends you too Yeah, I think I definitely have and It's my specific
[00:19:49.300] favorite when there is that kind of gender swap that you mentioned where maybe I can relate more to the guy or you know, James can relate more to the girl because there's just something about advice coming from
[00:19:59.700] You know each gender that makes it hit a little bit differently Like it's either easier to understand if my girlfriend is telling me. Oh, I've been in your husband's shoes Like I understand what he means then it's like I think easier for me to process a little bit
[00:20:13.920] It also just is like a very unique experience, right? Like being able to present your relationship struggles to like a jury of two people And not just like one friend. Like if I go to my one friend, I know she'll have my back
[00:20:27.600] She'll support me but with a couple you can get a little bit more nuanced maybe or different perspectives Yeah, I think regardless it's very interesting to hear about like other couples and how they are similar or like maybe even
[00:20:42.800] Extremely not similar to how like you operate with your significant other and then sometimes it like you can really tell during dates I guess like one thing that I always find kind of funny to notice is like who Sits down and immediately starts pouring the water for everyone
[00:21:00.480] Like Setting out the utensils and stuff like that. It's pretty interesting to observe these things as well as like discuss Yeah, there's also Speaking of like those small mannerisms when it comes to planning double dates
[00:21:16.240] Like there's always the people who do more of the coordinating within a couple So actually amongst me and Brian Daniel Nester Brian and Nester actually talk to each other most mean Daniel just like chillin in the back
[00:21:27.160] They'll be like, oh what time are we going? Like what are you guys? When will we see you? Where do you want to eat? And then me and Daniel literally just like do the little reacts Haha
[00:21:41.720] That's pretty much it cuz it's like whatever Esther is communicating to Brian Daniel's involved whatever Brian is communicating Esther Like I am involved. So it's fun to see like who in the relationship does that part two? Oh my god, that reminds me of like a super funny moment
[00:21:58.680] So yeah Sometimes like me and my boyfriend hang out with Jisoo and James and then one time James and my boyfriend planned something for us and they were like texting each other and then we didn't know about this prior, right?
[00:22:11.160] So like I think one time I saw James pop up on my boyfriend's phone and I was like you and James like text And then I think GC you said you had like the same thing happen on your end too and we were both hella confused
[00:22:26.200] Yeah, I was like why is crystals boyfriend like bed bar requesting you and he was like, oh like don't worry about it Don't worry Yeah, we were like that's weird cuz normally it's it's like me and Jisoo
[00:22:41.960] But isn't that like kind of the goal of like hanging out with your other couples It's like at some point, you no longer see each other as like the other couple. It's like those two people are our friends
[00:22:54.320] That's true. I think it's more because like we have a group chat. So we're like, why are you texting on the side? Whatever you are talking about should be able to
[00:23:04.820] See that makes no sense. I think that was the more shocking part. We're like, oh you guys are texting like Individually on the side like outside Actually, that's a funny thing to like couples group chats I think last week or so
[00:23:19.420] I went to go watch James play volleyball and then Kate also goes to those volleyball sessions as well So I texted her I was like, oh my god, like are you going to the game tonight or whatever?
[00:23:29.140] and then I was telling James like oh like I text Kate like I'm waiting for her response and then he was like Oh, I don't think you sent it and I was like what and he was like
[00:23:37.420] Oh, I didn't get a notification in the group chat. And I was like Do you think that I would? Is all my communication supposed to go through our group But yeah, I feel like those couple group chats are really easy to use because it's just like I
[00:23:57.300] Don't want to have to tell you and then go and tell it like your partner too It's just like everyone sees this But what's funny is I have the the two couples that hang out with the most are Daniel Nester and my friends Yes, and Jesse
[00:24:09.980] so we have one with the six of us and then I have group chats with just Daniel Nester or just with Jess and Jesse and then so sometimes me and Brian will like think of something like what movie to watch right and
[00:24:21.420] It'll be like a movie. We're like, okay, we want to watch inside up to And then we'll just be like who would enjoy this the most right so that we're just like which which group chat to
[00:24:33.380] He is like, how are we gonna plan out this movie date? Actually? Yeah, so have options exactly but then for the most part we just tend to lean towards the one where it's just like everyone involved because it's just like if You like to you will show up
[00:24:48.580] If you don't want to watch that movie Movies are always like really easy one to invite people to because if somebody doesn't want to come you can just be like yeah They just don't like that movie You know
[00:24:59.860] Nobody takes offense and like you don't really feel the pressure of having to like keep up a conversation because it's a movie well, this is kind of crazy though because one of the recurring things we talked about on this podcast is
[00:25:12.700] my theory about trios and how they can cause a little bit of friction and As we're talking about double dates and having like triple dates I feel like a group of three couples is actually a trio because the unit is the couple
[00:25:27.900] Yeah, yeah, so that's very interesting. Actually, that is very interesting I can see it being a little bit difficult to manage I guess the biggest struggle is the one that I just mentioned right like
[00:25:38.780] in within this activity who would enjoy this the most or sometimes it's just like I haven't spent as much time with This couple let me spend more time with this couple. I've been seeing this couple a lot recently
[00:25:50.540] so it's just like trying to balance out the amount of time we spend with each of our friends because they're both Important to us and we don't want you to feel we don't want them to feel like we like you more Than you because that's not true, right?
[00:26:05.020] So I guess that's like the most difficult part But for the most part all of them are really really understanding if they see we're hanging out with the other couple
[00:26:13.540] Nobody has ever said anything. Nobody ever voiced anything and honestly, I've never asked but like you just you just I had just have this feeling That they're like pretty okay with it. Like I've never felt any sort of tension even unspoken
[00:26:27.740] To be fair. I do think like a trio of couples is a little less intense I guess because even if say like one part of the trio is quote-unquote left out. They still have each other Ah
[00:26:41.820] Right, so it's not like someone's like truly left out on their own, right? So question for you guys do you think that having a Big group date. So for example more than three couples, right? Say like four or five six couples or something like that
[00:26:57.540] Is that double dating on hard mode or do you think the more couples you add like the easier it gets? Whoa, hmm I actually don't think that we've ever specifically planned like just couples to hang out Yeah at that level of like amount
[00:27:15.260] What's it the same if it's just gonna get to more than just three couples at that point? It's just like okay Everyone should just come to whatever this is as long as we're able to like accommodate them because some activities are like limited To
[00:27:30.240] groups of four or groups of six like I feel like very rarely are there like activities that can accommodate like eight and more People but I would imagine that's like hard mode
[00:27:40.600] Yeah, cuz just planning for that many people in itself is already really hard. Yeah, but I do think maybe another potential like hard mode of Double dating or even triple dating is like doing a trip together versus just like a hangout I imagine that is probably pretty difficult
[00:28:00.440] Dude, I've actually never gone on a trip with the two couples that I hang out with the most I don't know if the one I went to Hawaii with you Jisoo even counts
[00:28:09.680] I think it doesn't cuz it was like strictly couple. It wasn't strictly. Yeah, right, but I know that Both of you have done it I got invited to one Recently, but I couldn't make it when I got invited. I was like, whoa
[00:28:25.520] This is like for sure a double date like a double travel date. Ah Yeah, but you didn't actually also to Hawaii. No, I couldn't go cuz I was like, oh shoot that month I'm gonna be busy at work, but I feel like it definitely felt very official
[00:28:40.920] You know the other couple was already gonna go on this trip and they're like Oh by the way, like you two should join us and I was like, whoa, this is the real deal I have also never done like a truly
[00:28:54.680] Purely couples trip actually now that I'm thinking about it. I find it a little bit intimidating Because I feel like when you're going on a trip with just your so or like a trip with your group of friends Like these are things that I've experienced before
[00:29:08.600] So I know what kind of behaviors or like what kind of mindset makes a trip like that more successful And there's like routines right like how you travel with your so and stuff
[00:29:17.720] But I feel like going on a trip with another couple is almost like the halfway point so I'm like oh do I act like I'm going on a friend group trip or do I act like I'm going on a trip with my so and like what is the
[00:29:29.680] balanced midpoint Also, like what happens does everyone just like separate and do their own thing? Yeah at night and like Is there like limited? Interaction or is it like you hang out together?
[00:29:44.040] Most of the time or do you like do romantic things together as like two couples, you know So me and Brian have wanted to do like a trip with our friends Daniel and Esther for a while now
[00:29:55.520] And it is like slowly leaving the top. Let's do this. Let's go on this trip stages It's like more we've looked at like flights. We've looked at dates now, so it's slowly exiting the chat
[00:30:08.080] So we're hoping that we're gonna be able to do this but then I was thinking about this with Brian it's like precisely like what are we gonna do because Even as couples like that you each unit has their own separate interests
[00:30:21.800] I think Daniel and Esther would probably enjoy a little bit more of like nightlife Whereas me and Brian like we don't we don't drink. I don't stay up late He is able to but like he also does not prefer to so we are also thinking about like
[00:30:34.800] There are days where we should have like free days if like we're going to go on this trip Like there is a day like we collectively choose to do the things that would not interest the other couple And then we also thought about instead of having free days
[00:30:47.720] Like maybe we could also compromise a little bit like we don't have to do a full night of nightlife, right? Going to bars maybe but we could have like a few drinks here or there
[00:30:57.080] So that was like things that we had to consider too, but not to the full extent as it's not Like the trip is not there's no dates. There's no flights yet. I Think that makes sense
[00:31:08.760] So there's like some compromise and giving at least maybe half a day to a full day for each couple to just enjoy The trip on their own to yeah for coming back together. Yeah, it's a pretty good strategy. Yes
[00:31:21.000] But have not gone on one. I'm looking forward to it. I'll let you know how it goes Yeah, come back and give us the I Know my friends have gone on one that one was a little bit awkward
[00:31:37.120] Because the trip was planned for three couples and one of the couples had broken up Oh, no but then they both went on the trip and so when the two couples that were still together like went off and did I
[00:31:51.880] Think they actually did a free day where like they went on like, okay, let's have a nice dinner here The second couple was like, okay. We want instead of going a nice dinner
[00:32:00.120] We want to go do another thing and the couple that had split up had stayed behind and then they were just like talks Anyways, it can be but yeah, that's precisely why it's like considered hard mode, right? because there's nothing that you can really do if
[00:32:17.880] Like the other couple is experiencing some sort of hardship whether they are breaking up whether they are currently in a fight whether You don't know what the situation is, but when they're experiencing like something difficult
[00:32:31.400] That's not your place to say something. It's never your place to comment on somebody else's relationship Unless you were asked to it could be a bit awkward It can be very difficult to navigate being like, okay. What are we supposed to do now?
[00:32:45.000] Cuz the plan was to have fun Right Also as you're saying this though, I'm starting to think when you take a trip with you know other couples It's kind of like a trip where you're allowed to
[00:32:59.520] Leave the main group for a bit with your you know with your unit to like do whatever you want to I think it's like It's easier to split up in like a double date or triple date situation on a trip where you're like
[00:33:11.680] Oh like me and my so I want to go do this We'll meet back with you guys in a couple hours versus like imagine a friend group and then one person is like I'm gonna run off and Everyone would probably be like wait. No, like we'll all join
[00:33:25.160] Like, you know, we'd prefer it if you didn't run off on your own It's also really easy within I guess like the pros of being on like a double date or a double Couple trip travel date is that when you are splitting up even if it's the activity
[00:33:39.800] It's like the booth like how are we going to sit? It's really easy to just be like, okay, obviously we will sit like with our partners or it could be even fun to just if
[00:33:50.440] It's a activity where you can make it competitive like say you're going to mini golf, right? It could be like it will in heteronormative relationships It could be like boys versus girls or like we're gonna team up and it could just be like really fun because it
[00:34:04.880] Supposedly at in every couple date whether it's always a set of two, right? So it's really easy to split the things evenly and I always think that's really fun because I think things that are like Competitive in nature of really fun
[00:34:19.280] Speaking of that though. I also think double dates are really good to get to know someone's new partner So like, you know in the mini golf example You said if you did like a you know girls versus boys
[00:34:30.280] Then it's easy for you to like get to know the other girl better If like she's the new person in the friend group or The guy gets a chance to get to know the other guy better if he's like the new so and so I feel like
[00:34:45.200] Kind of going back to what we talked about like being intentional with double dates Think like my most intentional double dates have been when there's like a new So and then either I'm the one getting
[00:34:58.360] Introduced to like other people or there's another new so that's being introduced to like us yeah, I think doing like the gender thing where you do girls versus guys or something is always really really easy because
[00:35:11.960] Everyone there is by default like closest to their so so then the main Objective of all four people there is to like get closer to the other person's so we're like You know get close to the other person essentially
[00:35:24.440] So then I think having that shared objective makes it really good vibes It's like we're all just trying to get to know each other better or likes get even closer and etc So I feel like it always brings really good energy up
[00:35:38.200] Getting to know your friends new significant other hasn't really happened for me What about like Esther and DZ oh The one example I've been using this entire episode Just forgot with Daniel because like we hadn't known him for so long
[00:36:01.360] Long Esther was just like a huge welcome surprise she got along with Brian and I really well and in different ways too because she games and like Brian does not talk about Things that are not like gaming or anything And she's very inclusive too
[00:36:23.240] So like they got along really well and the things that I would think that brought her and easy together the things that they bonded over are Similar interests similar hobbies same sense of humor because they clicked so well
[00:36:36.840] I would say like as friends before as partners that made it out so much easier For me and Brian to get close to her too because like the way that we are close to Daniel It's the same that way that we are close to her now
[00:36:51.120] and it was also just really nice for me to just be able to have somebody who Was able to be as much of a friend to me as She is to Brian and like that
[00:37:03.280] I really really value like Jisoo like I think that's true for you as well. And I think that's really important to me But meeting her for the first time right? It was really easy with Esther because she is so open She wants to get to know you more
[00:37:18.920] So I felt like I didn't have to put in as much as of an effort Because of that it felt very effortless because this person wants to get to know us so That is my only experience. Do you guys feel when your friend has a new partner?
[00:37:33.720] that they actually Put in more effort to get to know you more because they're just like I need to make a good first impression on my new Significant others friends. I think for the most part
[00:37:46.960] yes, and there's like an added layer where it's like I am probably super close with my friend and Love that friend dearly and then that friend loves her partner or his partner
[00:37:59.300] So then by proxy like we're probably somewhat similar ish people and will naturally get along since like people attract like people But I think also that's not always the case even though that is the ideal situation
[00:38:11.280] Like there are times where maybe your friends new SO is someone that you don't really click with off the bat But I think either way like at least
[00:38:20.200] Getting to know them in a double date setting is significantly easier than meeting them like in a big group setting or like at a bigger Party or something like that. So even if we don't always like click naturally or like immediately
[00:38:32.440] I feel like I always at least appreciate like that double date setting so that I could actually just like get to know that So I feel like also another interesting Angle, so for someone like me where me and my boyfriend's friend groups aren't as like connected
[00:38:48.940] Sometimes I feel like if say like one of my boyfriend's close friends gets a new significant other and they want him to meet her But then it's like oh, I can't just invite him like by himself
[00:39:00.540] Like he obviously has a girlfriend too. So then it turns into a double date, you know And then I'm like there to meet that person too. But I mean not to say that
[00:39:09.940] Originally, they're like no crystal doesn't need to meet this person, but it's just like it's an interesting Situation versus like two people already being extremely close with the third friend and then meeting the significant other
[00:39:22.420] I think it's interesting you guys think that double dates are a great way to like meet the other significant other for me I feel like it's always high stakes Okay, cuz I'm always just like the new partner if
[00:39:35.540] They're trying to like make a good first impression on their significant others friends But for me when I'm like meeting my friends new significant other I'm like, okay I need to like for the sake of my friend
[00:39:45.140] I need to be like not weird like I don't want the new person to be like, what did I get into? Who am I actually dating? I'm careful of making like jokes that like only makes sense to me and my friend
[00:39:57.240] So, I don't think it's it's the most Comfortable situation I think but that's just based on my experiences I think that definitely dependent upon your relationship with your friend and then also the type of person that they tend to fall for
[00:40:14.880] Yeah, I think I can see what you mean. Like sometimes it's less Whelming to me in a bigger group of people, but sometimes it is also More manageable just meeting this one person slash two people. It's easier with some people
[00:40:30.680] it's more difficult with some people and I feel like if you are the person introducing your new significant other to your friends then Choosing how you want to introduce your friend whether that is in a small group setting with like another couple or whether that's like
[00:40:45.200] Bringing your new significant other to your entire friend group That is like up to you to decide based off what you already know about your new partner. Yeah, that's true
[00:40:55.040] I think some people do better in small group settings versus other people do better in large group settings and then Sussing that out is like your job as the person Introducing your partner to all your friends and I guess it's also your job to choose a good
[00:41:09.560] Couple if you're trying to do a double date to be like, alright this this couple will make me seem less weird Or it could be like oh this couple knows me really well Like this hanging out with this couple is like the best and most accurate representation
[00:41:26.480] Of me and my humor and like my past life. So maybe that's how you choose the couple as well Me immediately thinking about the impressions So speaking of you know choosing which couples to go on a double date with are there any qualities that
[00:41:43.320] Kind of make you immediately think oh this couple would be like really fun to have a double date with Yes at the very least I think everyone involved in this double date needs to have the potential to be friends as Individuals in the near future. Oh, wow
[00:42:04.720] Dude, that's kind of like hard though, isn't it? It is very hard Yeah Like I mean relationships themselves are hard just trying to melt your entire life and who you are with another Person is a difficult task. And so doing that with double the amount
[00:42:23.960] Should also be hard is how I think about that So for me, it's like a good double date will happen if I can see myself being friends with my friend's partner or The other couple as individuals I could spend time alone with that person
[00:42:40.480] I could hold a conversation alone with that person Each person should be comfortable with the other three people Individually and then that way there's no awkwardness like when you are out because sometimes you'll like naturally fall into
[00:42:54.120] Conversations with just one individual and if the other two people aren't comfortable with each other Then it's like pretty weird for them too And that awkwardness does influence the overall environment that the four of us are in right?
[00:43:07.120] So making sure that everyone is comfortable with each other on an individual level is very important I guess like to help with that one factor. I'm thinking of is like similar sense of humor for sure
[00:43:20.400] I think one of the like easy things to bond over especially with like new partners is poking fun at your friend right like oh Isn't it annoying how so-and-so does this or like do you ever notice that?
[00:43:36.560] Like without trying to cause like drama just something to be like, oh, yeah You know, I have noticed that it's just like oh, yeah I know this person has done that for a long time but then on the flip side
[00:43:46.320] Like it's also could be an endearing quality like it opens the conversation up to be like bonding over what you like About your friends them romantically you platonically
[00:43:59.040] And also the things that you just know from hanging out with this person for a long time and then dating them for However, they along they are dating Mm-hmm. So yeah same sense of humor like they're on board with that then it's really easy
[00:44:12.880] But sometimes if they're not you're just like, oh now what do I do? Now now I just feel like an insult to their significant There's nothing more awkward than like a dinner of four people and then three people are laughing and the other one is like
[00:44:31.360] Yeah, how do you recover from that I think the more I think about it what you said makes total sense Maybe the sign of what makes a really good double date is it doesn't feel super double dating and it more so feels like oh
[00:44:49.680] we're just for people who like each other's company and enjoy hanging out and It feels less formal less like we are on this for the purpose of a double date and it's just in general better vibes
[00:45:01.400] So I think it makes sense that all four people should be able to consider each other like friends At the very least I think another good thing to have is a shared interest Just because that could be the double date activity itself
[00:45:16.160] And if you know if conversation starts to die, you can at least pull from that shared interest and like get things going again That's why I really like for if I'm actually planning like a double date to do something that is activity like interactive
[00:45:31.640] acts throwing me I think I've said mini golf like A lot of times but like arcade the arcade or even just something like I don't know pottery making tufting
[00:45:43.080] When you've just run out of things to say like just being like, okay now it's time to focus on the thing that we came Here to do is like a very easy way to just fill in the spaces between the conversation
[00:45:52.400] I think just one last mini quality that I have is balance So I feel like the couple has to feel balanced where it's not just like
[00:46:01.000] You're hanging out with one person of other person is an add-on like you have to feel like you're hanging out with both people and Then also the two couples should also feel balanced like it's two units kind of equally hanging out rather than
[00:46:13.400] Feeling like it's leaning one way or another which I think it's kind of abstract But then once you're in a double date that doesn't feel balanced. I feel like you can totally feel that like lack of equilibrium
[00:46:24.440] Yeah, and I think that tends to happen with like when relationships are newer because the other Couple is still like or maybe it could be your own relationship, right? But you're still you're still getting to know each other and on top of getting to know your own partner
[00:46:39.440] You're also trying to get to know their friends, right? So it is pretty hard to do but that comes really that balance that you're sensing I find comes very very naturally with couples that are already established Right, like they're already secure with who they are
[00:46:56.040] Individually and as a couple so that is a good quality to have but I don't know how you can suss that out Without talking to them and already interacting with them. But I guess you're like already on the
[00:47:14.960] Guess the only indication is just like length of relationship pretty safe to assume that these people have been together for a while That it would be easy to approach them as a couple as well I think also if like maybe
[00:47:29.780] You know three out of four of that double date has already hung out and had a good time Then it increases the chances because they're like, okay, what's one more? To add to the equation, you know, hopefully if we all just you know, try hard to like
[00:47:45.480] To be friendly and to be inclusive then it'll be like most likely better results than worse ones Well, this has been such an interesting conversation. I feel like I'm looking at double dates way more analytically now Before we started recording but in a good way
[00:48:02.800] Like I think double dates are a really great opportunity to get to know people Get to know your friend better or your friends so better, etc So thank you for sharing your tips and your personal perspectives on double dates and
