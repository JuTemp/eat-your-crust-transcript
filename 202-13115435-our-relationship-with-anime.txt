[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Amber. So today we have on our good friend Amber. And before we dive into the topic with Amber today, Crystal, do you have a Gen Z word for us this week?
[00:00:27.460] I do. So the word is actually a word this time, because I feel like in the past it's usually been phrases. The word is era. Oh. The usage of this, which I'm sure you two are relatively familiar with it, it's basically like in my blank era or like in your blank era. So it pretty much means during this time you are doing something.
[00:00:55.260] So I guess like a good example would be like, I'm in my gymming era, which would mean that like, you're trying to go to the gym more. And it's like an active goal, I guess you could kind of put it as. Indeed, indeed. Maybe we can go around and say what era we're currently in to like, rather demonstrate the usage. And I can start. I've been in my wake up at 7am era because our room doesn't have any blackout curtains.
[00:01:22.260] So it's like, it has these kind of like thin blinds that are made from like fabric. So in the morning, all the sunlight shines through our window into the bedroom, because the sun has been rising so early. I have also been rising early with the sun. So yeah, I'm in my wake up at 7am era. I'm curious, does James also wake up with you?
[00:01:46.860] Yeah, he does. And then we kind of take turns like falling back asleep. Sometimes I'll wake up and I'll come to at 7am. And I vaguely hear like TikTok sounds coming from his side of the bed. And then I'll like pass out again. We just go through that until like 8.30, 9am. Oh my god. I'm low key in that right now too. But it's not as like peaceful as yours. It's because like we have construction outside. So every morning when I wake up, I'm like, oh, please.
[00:02:16.980] Oh, I'm in my water bottle era. Oh, because in the past, I usually never bring a water bottle around. But this year for my birthday, I asked for a water bottle. And ever since getting it, I've been trying, like consciously putting in the effort to bring it everywhere. Like I bring it to work. I bring it when I go out. I'm in my water bottle era.
[00:02:41.800] Love that. How big is it? Oh my god, it's so small. I specifically asked. I specifically asked for the smallest size, which is 17 ounces. Wait, low key same because I actually feel like it's easier to like bring around and carry with you to actually make sure you're like drinking water. But then when I run out, I run out. Yeah.
[00:03:02.560] Oh, I actually mentioned this the other day, but I think I'm in my rat girl era. I just like, I saw a TikTok that was like this summer instead of hot girl summer, people should just have like two days to themselves and just rot. And that's my life. Dude, I've been unknowingly in my rat girl era for life. It's so peaceful still. It truly is. I love embracing my rat girl side too.
[00:03:32.820] Sometimes when there's a weekend with like no plans, I'm like, oh my god, this is my vegetation era. Oh my god, yes. Oh wait, I literally remember that weekend when James was gone. And then we were gonna hang out or something. But then you were just like, man, I just want to vegetate. I was like, sorry guys, don't count. I'm gonna show up to anything this weekend. So this word era, I have a feeling because I couldn't really find an origin for it.
[00:04:02.060] But I feel like it might be influenced by Taylor Swift because you know how she has like different eras for her albums kind of unofficially, I guess. And even her tour right now, it's called the Eras Tour. Oh, interesting. Because I think she like specifically is singing songs from all the albums. So I feel like that might have had some influence on the usage of the eras word. It actually reminds me of something core, you know? Oh.
[00:04:30.140] Like how people are like cottagecore or like balletcore or I can't think of anymore. But just those two. Yeah. I was almost thinking, I mean, I guess like I was just thinking about the literal meaning of this word era. In history class, you like learn about all the different eras and stuff. And I was like, oh, maybe some high school students were learning about it in history. And they were like, oh, fuck it. Like, let's just use it in our daily terminology. Maybe. Maybe. I like it. I like it.
[00:04:58.760] It's kind of like a deviation of the word phase. You know, like people used to say, oh, I'm like in this whatever phase. But I feel like phase started to get a really negative connotation in some words. So people would be like, oh, it's not a phase, mom. It's a lifestyle. And then phase started like falling out of style. So I think era is a pretty good replacement for that. I like it. It sounds sophisticated. It does. Even rat girl era. Yeah.
[00:05:27.200] All right. So let's jump into our actual topic this week, which is talking about our relationships with anime and going into weed culture. I guess we can start off by talking about what age we started watching anime and what was the anime that hooked you in? I can start. I've never been hooked into anime.
[00:05:53.660] But do you guys remember like when we were younger in the evenings, Cartoon Network would show like, I think Naruto and one of the ones that I saw was like Inuyasha. And I think Bleach as well. I think those were like three of the bigger ones that were shown on Cartoon Network. English dubbed, of course. I started watching in like fifth grade. So that's like 15 years ago now. That's crazy, dude.
[00:06:23.440] Yeah. I know like they used to play it on the TV, but I don't think I ever like stayed up late enough or like was allowed to watch TV that late to like watch anime on TV. But my friend in fifth grade introduced me to Bleach, which I think is a little crazy for being in fifth grade. But she would give me like, I don't even know what I watched it on, but I definitely watched Bleach.
[00:06:47.220] And then she also gave me like DVDs or like also CDs of Bleach movies and stuff like that. But yeah, that was my gateway. I think I'm probably a little bit more like Crystal where I didn't really start watching anime voluntarily until I was 22, 23. The first anime that I really, really watched was My Hero Academia. Oh my God. And I even remember the whole like setting and the premise.
[00:07:16.520] Like I think I lost some bet with James and James is a big anime watcher, anime enjoyer. And so he was like, okay, now you have to watch this. And I was like, okay. And it was really good. And I was kind of sucked into it, but not enough to watch like a bunch of other animes. I was more sucked into this specific anime itself. But I did have exposure to anime when I was younger because a lot of my friends did really enjoy anime.
[00:07:41.600] In Inuyasha, like Crystal said, I was at a family friend party and my family friend who was like maybe four years older than me. She was like, oh, I have this DVD. Like we can watch it. And she like popped into the DVD and it's Inuyasha. And I was like, whoa. And then my other family friend, she was really into Cardcaptor Sakura. If you guys remember that. I have no idea what that is. Oh my God. I thought that was like super famous. It has like Masked Tuxedo Man. Wait, you guys don't know what I'm talking about? Sailor Moon?
[00:08:11.460] Masked Tuxedo Man? Wait, that's what I was thinking. Oh, am I mixing up my anime? But yeah, she was really into that. So we would watch it sometimes. I guess it really wasn't until I was 23 years old that I started watching anime myself. I think my brother has always enjoyed anime. I vaguely remember like when Inuyasha was on TV. I would watch it and I like literally had no idea what was going on.
[00:08:38.920] Because also like you have to catch it at the same time every day, which is not really what we did. So it was just like, oh my God, like what is going on this episode? And I didn't really get sucked into shows. But I do watch anime movies sometimes. I feel like Spirited Away was like, it made big waves when we were younger. And just like Ghibli movies in general. But to be honest, I've only seen like maybe two or three Ghibli movies.
[00:09:10.000] Yeah, I feel like one of the things that kind of intimidates me about anime is the sheer number of episodes there are. And it's kind of interesting when you think about it because a lot of anime episodes from my experience tend to be shorter. In terms of duration, it's probably not that long. And I've watched Succession, which is like 40 hours of TV. I just have like that thing of, oh, can I really sit down and watch like 200 episodes of this one anime? You know, it's more like a mental barrier, I think.
[00:09:39.900] I feel like, you know, they're like about 20 minutes long. But if you really think about it with like all the recap and like the credits and everything, it ends up being like 10, 15 minutes, really. They're so short. Skip intro. Yeah. It's true. So James, when he watches, he actually does this thing where he skips through. So like for him, he just watches the subbed versions, right?
[00:10:06.440] So like the audio is in the original Japanese and then he just reads the subtitles. So he just reads the subs, skips, reads, skips, reads, skips. So it's almost like he's reading manga. And I was like, just read the manga. He was like, I do. And I was like, wait, what the fuck? He's watching a slideshow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's so funny. Might as well just watch it on TikTok. True.
[00:10:32.760] I did try to watch some anime this past year, actually. I was talking with some friends and they were saying like, or we were talking about shows that we like. And I was like, oh, low key. I really love stories where there's like time travel involved or like reliving lives or something like that. And they're like, dude, there's like a whole genre of anime for this. And I was like, really? So they told me I should try to watch anime. And I was like, um, okay, I guess.
[00:11:02.420] So I got the suggestion to watch Erased, which is like a short anime too. I think it was only like 16 or 20 episodes. So they're like, oh, it won't be too bad. You won't have to like spend a hell of time watching it. It could be like an intro to anime. And I was like, okay, I'll give it a try. It was like pretty interesting. Not bad. Yeah. I would speak more on it, except I remember I liked it.
[00:11:29.580] But with a lot of anime and because I've watched so many, I only like vaguely remember if I like it or don't like it. And I don't remember what happened. So you're like, yes, that was a good one. But I don't remember any details. Wait, I low key feel that though, because I read books as a hobby. So then when people are like, oh, I'm reading this book. I'm like, oh shit, I read that. And they're like, oh my God, like, do you remember this part? And I'm like, no, but I do remember that was like a decent book.
[00:11:59.980] Even with shows, like any show, if I'm just watching something else right now and they like bring up a name from a previous show or like something else that I've consumed, I'll just be like, I literally don't know who that is. It's like the main character. You're like, who? I guess, especially with anime having 200 plus episodes for some of the really long ones. It's probably like really easy to just, you have to like store other shit in your brain.
[00:12:29.920] Do you keep my anime list, Amber? I don't. I think I did. Like there was this one summer probably in like high school where I just like binge watched hella anime and it was just like random anime too. I probably like saved a few of them. But then since then, I haven't. I like try to keep track of all the ones that I've watched, but I really cannot remember. My anime list for anyone who doesn't know is a way to track all the animes that you've watched. You can like write them.
[00:12:58.480] It's pretty much like the anime equivalent of Goodreads. When I first started dating James, I was like asking him about it and I knew about the concept of my anime list because a lot of my close friends kept it. We opened his account to like see what animes he like ranked really high and stuff and I found a written review on it. And there wasn't that many, maybe like a couple, but I was reading it and I was like dying laughing. Like it was so funny for some reason to think about James like sitting down at a computer, like typing out this review for this anime.
[00:13:30.140] That's so funny. Wait, that is really funny. I definitely can't imagine that either. I know, right? He's just so serious. He's like, damn, this anime was so shit. Funny enough, it was actually like a glowing review, which I feel like made it way funnier. He actually analyzed the anime. It's so good that he actually was put into action. Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:57.760] Okay, so I have a question as someone who doesn't really watch anime. So when I received the recommendation to watch Erased, there was like a whole discussion happening because it was like a couple friends and they were like, oh, is that like beginner friendly? You know, like, and they were like kind of talking about they're like, hmm, is this acceptable as like the first anime to watch?
[00:14:20.660] And then after I watched Erased, they were like, okay, maybe you should watch Death Note because Death Note is like an iconic beginner anime. And I was like, dude, what is beginner anime? Like, why am I starting from level zero? Like, what does this mean? Am I not good enough for intermediate anime yet? I feel like I would also definitely recommend Death Note as a beginner anime.
[00:14:46.940] But I feel like length is a big part of it because like, you know, people who haven't watched anime before do not want to like commit that time. Right. So it's definitely easier to get people into it if they know it's just like a 20 episode series. I'm trying to think what an intermediate or advanced anime would be. I think it's just like, you know, like the animes.
[00:15:12.260] Sometimes there's like more convoluted or like satirical plots that those ones I feel like, I don't know, maybe it would be an interesting gateway for people to get like interested. But at the same time, it's like, they probably don't want to be plopped into an anime that's like, super mind blowing. And they're like, wait, I just started watching this. What's going on?
[00:15:36.780] For satirical plots and stuff, would it be like, if you didn't watch enough anime, like you might not even realize it's satire? Maybe. And you might also feel like, I don't even know like how to explain it because I do not remember any animes that I've watched. But I definitely feel like, not even just like satirical, but if it's like just something like crazy happening, you'll be like, oh, why the fuck do people watch this?
[00:16:06.780] You know? Oh. Yeah. Interesting. I think that does bring up a good point, though, of like anime and a lot of characteristics about anime, I think can be really different from how American TV is or even like Korean TV is, at least for me. Of course, the biggest difference to me was like reading the subs part where I was like, holy shit, I actually have to like concentrate on like reading the subs now. So then we would only really watch it during like mealtimes because I have to like stare at the subs.
[00:16:36.180] And if we put it up on the TV and we weren't eating something, then I feel like I would just be on my phone or something. Just a personal bad habit. Another thing that struck me as interesting was apparently there's this whole like budget thing about like animations. And I really only heard about this when I was watching Haikyuu. There was a season in Haikyuu where the first like 10 episodes of the season, the animation looked like a slideshow to use Crystal's terms, where it was like the same picture.
[00:17:04.480] But then it would just move up and down and up and down. And then like just the subs would change or like just the mouths would open and close and open and close. But it like wasn't to the beat of like or like the inflection of the actual phrase. And I was like, what the fuck is this? And then James was like, oh, you know, like there's all this drama about anime studios. And then they usually save the budget for like more budget constrained shows, I guess, where like just the key episodes have really good animation.
[00:17:29.280] And then like the more quote unquote filler episodes have shittier animation so that the good episodes could be like the most flashy episodes of the show. And I was like, this is just insane to me. Like I cannot even understand or like grasp this. And it's just like all this tea about the studios that he just knows. And then the other thing, too, was like my friend Nat, she's like super into anime as well. She was like, oh, I'm going to watch this new anime. And I was like, oh, why?
[00:17:58.080] I like do like the plot or something. She's like, oh, no, there's just like this voice actor that I really like. And I was like, whoa, like the concept of following a voice actor to me was just culturally so crazy. That's so wild. Yeah, no, literally, I saw TikTok yesterday and then it was like a voice actor voicing his character. But it's like you could they were filming the actual VA. And then the comments under that TikTok were just like, I just need the voice actor. I don't even need to watch the anime.
[00:18:27.460] I was like, oh, my God. So crazy. And kind of on the flip side of the budget thing, I also saw another TikTok that was like, so one of One Piece's most recent episodes, they had, what is it, like 200 frames in the span of like a few seconds. Wow. Yeah, I was like, well, I don't really know how it works. And I'm definitely not quoting it correctly.
[00:18:55.220] Because I don't remember exactly like what the numbers were. But it was like they had so much art in just a split second, basically. Mm hmm. Wow. I guess One Piece has the budget because aren't they like the longest running anime ever or something? I definitely I watched up to like episode 700 or something. Oh, my God. No, but there's people that keep up. It's insane. But yeah, I need ketchup.
[00:19:25.000] Dude, I remember within the past three years, there was a One Piece movie. And I remember seeing people going to the movies and like dressing up as the main character guy, the hat and everything. Yeah. I was like, well, that's pretty cool. I've noticed that like they've been showing more anime movies in America, or at least like in the places that we live. They even will do the like original Japanese dub and then with the English subtitles, which is very cool to see.
[00:19:54.000] Like truly showing how anime has grown and the audience, the international audience is like really active as well. I know like a recent hype one was like the Jujutsu Kaisen one. A few of us actually went to go watch that one. And I think somebody watched it like twice or something. I was like, damn, it was good, though. I like how you were like, oh, a recent big one was Jujutsu Kaisen and me and Jizu just had like blank faces.
[00:20:25.000] Wait, I actually know that one. Oh, okay. Okay, not to expose James again, but James was gifted like a Jujutsu Kaisen shirt. So sometimes he wears it. Okay. Wait, that's so cute. I was literally like blank face. I was like, yes, totally. You're like, nice. I actually have some theories on, okay, I guess it's not theories, but maybe more like inflection points where I felt like anime got really mainstream.
[00:20:53.020] One is like in middle school and high school, I know people watched anime, especially since the school I went to for high school was like very Asian. But even back then, I feel like it was kind of still more on the niche level. There was like that one girl or like my one friend at high school who was like known to really like One Piece. And like people liked Cowboy Bebop, but it was only like a handful of them who would talk about it, things like that.
[00:21:18.540] So junior, senior year though, when Attack on Titans came out, every single class period, people would like group up and talk about it. And that was the first time where I felt like I was really not in the crowd because I didn't know it and I didn't watch it. And that's when I was like, oh shit, like this is kind of becoming like mainstream to the point where people are comfortable talking about it in public sort of. Not to say there's any shame in it, but before it was a little bit more like hidden, right? Yeah. Wait, question.
[00:21:47.700] So I actually thought Attack on Titan was newer because I feel like people have been talking about it recently. But I thought it was like, I don't know, like the up and coming. No, it's because they came out with like a new season recently. Oh, okay, okay. And I guess just like every time they come out with new seasons, like, you know, people are on it. So does that mean it's been a long time? Like how many seasons are there? Honestly, I have no clue.
[00:22:17.600] But I definitely, I watched it a little bit when it first came out. I want to say that was like the end of high school for me. I see. Wait, okay. I just looked it up. There's only four seasons. Oh, wow. That's crazy. And the fourth season is the final season. But it did come out 2022. Yeah, yeah. But I think it's still like super like hype for a lot of people. Yeah.
[00:22:45.160] And I think there's also like that connection to characters. So like, I don't know if you've seen like filters and stuff on like TikTok and stuff. I feel like people will keep it kind of in the loop because of like social media and their connection to these characters. Interesting. So I guess that means production took a while too if it first came out in like high school-ish. And then the final season was season four. Interesting.
[00:23:12.120] I don't know how many episodes they have per season though. Because I feel like usually animes, they turn out a lot of episodes pretty quickly. So I was surprised that they did it like season by season. Interesting. So the second inflection point that I have, I feel like is going to be kind of controversial. But hear me out, okay? Okay.
[00:23:33.140] I subscribe to the thought that when things have like a very mania level fandom, you know, those people might love something intensely, but it doesn't leak out to the mainstream. And sometimes like if people are super obsessed with it, then I feel like it can kind of stay niche longer because people are like, oh, this is like just for them. They're obsessed with it, but that has nothing to do with me.
[00:23:55.440] So I feel like when Porter Robinson started incorporating a lot of Japanese culture in his music and he started really blowing up, I felt like it became kind of cool to talk about it. Cool to indulge in like quote unquote weeb culture. And that's why, you know, more people maybe came out of the shadows to like talk about their hobbies.
[00:24:19.540] Or that's why maybe more people became interested in anime in the first place, which I know is kind of like shitty because, you know, anime is so famous and like a lot of Asian people were already indulging in it. So to be like, oh, this like white dude came out with like some music and then like it became mainstream is kind of a shitty thought. But sometimes that's like kind of how it works, in my opinion. It takes like one famous white person to like publicly acknowledge their interest in something and then people are like, oh, now it's like cool to enjoy it.
[00:24:48.540] But that's my controversial opinion. I think that makes sense, too, because probably when people were like, oh, my God, he's he's like incorporating anime stuff or whatever. A lot of people who are probably like already fans of this stuff were like, wow, like I feel embraced.
[00:25:08.580] Yeah. And then probably even like people who weren't into anime and stuff like that, if they see their favorite artist or whatever being into this stuff, they're like, oh, maybe it's like cool to, you know, be into anime and things like that. That's cringe, though. Okay, I also thought of another anime that I watched when I was younger, which I did actually like a lot. Dragon Ball series. Oh.
[00:25:42.300] No, I think it's like a favorite for a lot of people just because they grew up with it. But I didn't watch it on TV or anything like that. So I cannot relate. But also, like, I know it's just like a nostalgic thing for a lot of people. But sometimes I see the art and I'm like, damn, they're so ugly. And I'm like, I don't think I could ever get into it.
[00:26:09.290] I do think it's definitely like a nostalgia thing for sure. And it's also kind of funny because like the storylines in it, they get wilder and wilder as like the story progresses. The main guy, Goku, he just keeps dying, but then they just keep bringing him back. They like keep finding loopholes. They're like, oh, yeah, you're only allowed to bring him back to life like one time max. And then the next season or whatever, the next bad guy, they're like, we have to bring him back. Like there's a loophole.
[00:26:37.510] There's actually another set of Dragon Balls that we can use. It's just like it gets more and more crazy. And I think people like to think about it and like kind of make fun of it. How ridiculous it gets. I think in the same vein, like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is also appealing to people in that way. Not because like they, you know, pull shit out of their ass every season.
[00:27:03.570] But like, but it's actually like if you watch it, you're like, how did I get from point A to point 10? You're watching it and then halfway through, you're like, wait, how the fuck did I get here? You know, this is kind of a random tangent, but JoJo's was also semi popular, I think, when we were growing up. And I used to really love this game called JoJo's Fashion Show. And there's like multiple editions of this game. And it's a really good game.
[00:27:30.630] I was like playing this, you know, every night after high school or whatever. And then I would go to school and people were like, oh, like, I just started watching JoJo's or like, I love JoJo's. And I'd be like, oh, my God, like you guys play JoJo's too? They'd be like, no, it's like an anime. And I was like, oh, sorry. You're like, I'm just going to leave now. I'm like, yeah, no, love the anime. They have good fashion in the anime, though. Do you have any more inflection points?
[00:27:59.130] I think that was probably the two big ones that I was thinking of. But did you feel like you noticed any, Amber, since you were more in the culture at a young age? I did have one to add. I mean, I think you hit it pretty well. But I also feel like because I grew up in our area that it was just like, oh, people do watch anime. That it doesn't feel like it really got blown up.
[00:28:26.550] But I definitely saw like, maybe it's just my algorithm or something. But right before COVID, I saw a lot of content on like Instagram and TikTok of like athletes, gym people being really into anime. And then they would kind of infuse that into their personality. Interesting. Yeah, but I don't know what prompted that at all. Interesting.
[00:28:54.850] I wonder if it was like One Punch Man. Yeah. I remember that was like a big thing for a while. It's the main guy, right? And he's just like, yeah, I just do like 100 pushups every day and like run X amount of miles. And now I'm so strong. Yeah, I think there's that. And then, I mean, I guess in general, a lot of anime is like there's like hella buff dudes and like people that are hella strong and stuff. So they just kind of, oh, I can do that IRL.
[00:29:24.550] Yeah, I could see that. I think another big moment for anime was when Naruto ended. I think a lot of people were talking about that. And I think they weren't afraid to talk about it because it was like a big event in the anime world. So I think that was another thing that I really noticed. Yeah. That was another one that was shown on like Cartoon Network when we were younger. So I think a lot of people would at least like recognize the name even if they weren't into anime.
[00:29:54.290] I even see people wearing like Naruto merch at the gym sometimes. Whoa. Whoa. But then it's like it's like kind of low key. So it's like you wouldn't know unless you've watched it before or like you know a little bit about it. If you know, you know kind of thing. Yeah, yeah. But then sometimes like you see it and you're like, okay. You're the gym anime people. Okay, good. Good thing you clarified because I was imagining them like wearing the headbands or something.
[00:30:25.230] He has the wig on. It was just like a pair of like the one that I saw the other day was like just a guy wearing a pair of shorts and it just had like a pattern from the show. Yeah. Oh my god. Actually, speaking of Naruto, the Naruto run kind of went viral. I remember that. That was probably another thing that helped expose a lot of people to anime in general. Like where's this run from? It's from this anime. Dude, I almost wonder if it was the opposite. Like, oh, this run is weird.
[00:30:54.970] I'm not touching anime with a 10-foot pole. Oh wait, that's true. I don't want to become them. I do kind of have a random question though, where we've been talking a lot about Naruto, which I know is like a very big anime. But I feel like even when something is really famous, there are still kind of like stereotypes that you might associate with like a hardcore Naruto fan or a hardcore JoJo's fan or etc, etc.
[00:31:23.230] So do you have any kind of like associations like that with some of the bigger animes? I actually refused to watch Naruto for like the longest time. Just because I think just subconsciously maybe, because it was on Cartoon Network that I was kind of like, oh, it's just like an American cartoon. You know, it's not really an anime. But I mean, obviously it's not. Don't come for me.
[00:31:52.950] You're like, shit, actually it's one of the most revered anime. But I think, you know, because it is on like kids TV, basically, I did feel like there's like a level of maybe immaturity to the anime that I was just kind of like, oh, it's just like for kids. It's just this guy that's like, you better believe it. I'm going to get stronger. I love my friends, you know? Shit, you're right.
[00:32:22.230] And I did watch like some of it, I think up to where someone important died. And then I was just like, all right. It's like pretty much the same. You know, there's a new bad guy. They fight and then they're sad. And then, oh, but my friends make it all better. And they change outfits. Yeah. To show their progression. Only after like 10 years. So smelly.
[00:32:50.550] You know what's also an anime that I think we forget is an anime? Pokemon. I was literally talking about this with Dustin yesterday. Mind blown. Oh my god. But it's also for babies. I think because like we're so used to seeing the English dubbed ones that we forget it's literally a Japanese anime. That is so interesting because the only exposure to like the Pokemon show that I had growing up was I had these two DVDs of Pokemon.
[00:33:19.690] And then on it, there's like pretty much one episode each. But I never realized that I was just watching like two episodes of anime over and over in my childhood. Like that is actually mind blowing. Because in my mind, I'm like, oh, it's like my DVD. I love to watch this DVD. Yeah. But it's literally like two episodes of Pokemon. That's so funny. I'll be honest. I never watched Pokemon. Dude, I watched like the whole first arc, I guess.
[00:33:48.710] Like the very beginning. And then the like first movie. Those were like pretty much the only that I watched. Wow. Well, I would catch like glimpses of it at daycare because they would just like have the TV on over the summer and then a bunch of kids would crowd in the room to watch Pokemon. For whatever reason, you know, if Pokemon was on, I was kind of like, eh, whatever.
[00:34:11.290] But then if it was, you know, American TV that I know is supposed to be on American TV, like Chowder or something like that, I was like, damn, that's lit. Wait, what is Chowder? Oh, it's not an anime. It was just like a TV show. Wait, you guys never seen Chowder? No. It's like some Cartoon Network cartoon, right? I vaguely, like the name sounds kind of familiar, but I don't think I ever watched it. Yeah, it's just like a purple dude. Really cute.
[00:34:40.270] Oh my god, I'm remembering like a bunch of random childhood animes now. Like Yu-Gi-Oh was also one. Mm-hmm. I think it was interesting though because from my memory, like it was only really that first season, I guess, that was shown or at least that I remember watching. And so I didn't realize it was like a long ass anime. I mean, Pokemon is still going on even now, I think. Wow. Or it might have just ended maybe. I don't know.
[00:35:09.770] And then Yu-Gi-Oh, I think is also still going on, right? I have no idea. But it's just, it's so interesting because at the time I kind of viewed it as like just an American cartoon because it was shown on Cartoon Network, similar to what you were saying, Amber. But then later it was like the realization happened like, oh, these are actually animes. So I wonder if that also factored into some of anime's popularity or maybe people were like 10, 15 years later,
[00:35:38.790] someone like makes them realize, oh, I was actually watching anime as a child. And then the genre suddenly feels less intimidating or foreign, I guess. Maybe. Because I feel like a lot of people really like Pokemon, especially because the like game franchise is really big. That's like a pretty normalized anime, if anything. Digimon also. Oh, yeah.
[00:36:03.770] I watched like maybe two episodes of Pokemon or something, but I really cannot remember anything. Wait, maybe it was the movie. Oh. Where Pikachu was like, well, I guess Pikachu probably gets injured a lot. Was it the one where Mewtwo comes out? I wouldn't know. So I never really watched Cartoon Network growing up, but I definitely had some exposure, especially to Pokemon.
[00:36:29.410] But I remember one summer I went back to Korea and then my cousin was watching Pokemon. All of the names are different, right? Because it's like Korean dubbed. So Ash Ketchum, his name is like Jiwoo. I just looked it up and it's like Hanjiwoo. And then Misty, her name is Chae Isil. And then Brock's name is Woo. And I was like, I was like trying to familiarize myself with these names. And I was like, who the fuck? Like, I know that's Ash, but why do they keep saying Jiwoo?
[00:36:58.770] And it was just like crazy. And I had like a really similar experience with Spongebob. Where Spongebob, like the Korean dub names are all different too. Okay, I think that makes sense though. Because apparently Ash's name in Japanese is not Ash. Oh. I would think so. Okay, so I just looked it up and it's Satoshi. Oh shit. How did they come up with Ash? Dude, I have no idea.
[00:37:29.050] Not even close. Speaking of Spongebob, in Mandarin, it's also like, I mean, it's kind of like Spongebob, but then they call him like Haimian Bao Bao, which is directly like Spongebob. Spongebob, like Spongebob, like Spongebob. Yeah. It's so cute. I just looked up the Spongebob names in Korean and I guess Spongebob is still like Suponjibab. And then his last name was just Squarepants, but like directly translated. But I always thought it was so mean that they called Patrick Doongi, which kind of is like
[00:37:58.810] fat ass, but in like a daring way. Holy shit. And then Squidward, his name is Jingjingi, which kind of means like complainer. Oh my God. I don't know. I was just like, damn, these are like sort of mean. Like, I don't know. Damn, but Spongebob, his reputation is intact. Yeah. Interesting. I wonder why they changed Pokemon's names. Because I'm thinking about like Yu-Gi-Oh! And I think they kept everyone's name.
[00:38:27.890] Except for that one dude, his name's Joey. I'm not sure if his Japanese name is still Joey. Wait, Joey is crazy. Dude, so Joey in Japanese version, his name is Katsuya Jinoki, I think. Whoa. That's crazy. Joey is close a little bit. And then his English name is Joseph Joey Wheeler. It's so white. Wait, yeah. He just became white. Yeah.
[00:38:57.750] Dude, that's so funny. So Amber, as someone who loves anime, I have a final question for you, which is, do you feel like there have ever been any side effects from watching anime? And I do want to clarify, like, not side effects in a negative way, but how does watching anime kind of impact your life?
[00:39:18.450] I guess some examples could be like, have you ever felt an anime hangover where once you finish the anime, you're like, holy shit, I need to like sit and think about this and wallow in the after effects of this anime for a long time. Or maybe anime even opened up learning about the Japanese language or culture, etc, etc. So what have been your personal side effects? I see what you mean by hangovers now.
[00:39:43.350] After I watch it, I don't necessarily need to like sit in it or anything. But then if I really, really like the anime, I'll feel like, oh my god, I need to find more animes that are like exactly like this. Which is really hard to find, actually, just because they're all a little bit different. And then even if they're kind of the same genre, like it might not really hook me in as much as the one that I really liked.
[00:40:06.670] And there was like this one summer where I watched like one romance, kind of like slice of life romance anime. And then I was like, I need more. And then I just like spent that whole summer watching like romance anime. Oh my god. This is so funny. There's like an opposite of anime hangover. It's like anime addiction. No, literally though. Sometimes I like isekai genre.
[00:40:34.570] After I watched Sword Art Online, I was like, oh my god, I need to find like another one that's like this. But I feel like I can only think of like one other one that is like that right now. Yeah, it's really hard to like find one that's like exactly kind of like what you're looking for. So isekai is the like reborn shit, right? The stuff that I supposedly would enjoy. Yeah. And Sword Art Online is, it's kind of like VR.
[00:41:00.290] But then it's kind of like that episode in Black Mirror where they put on their little goggles and then they are like in a new world. Except in the anime, you can like live there for an extended period of time or something like that. Interesting. Yeah. Oh, is that why it's Sword Art Online? Yeah. Oh, dude. Okay. For the longest time, whenever I heard the anime name Sword Art Online, I was like literally like Sword Art Online?
[00:41:29.030] Like I didn't realize it was an anime. I think the game in the anime is called Sword Art Online. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crystal's imagining like an eBay, but it's just for artwork. That's about swords. Exactly. I was like, why are people so obsessed with Sword Art Online? Why not offline?
[00:41:55.250] You know, after watching anime for so long, like maybe I can understand like some phrases, but they're not even like really practical. I think because they're so like dramatized in anime. If I look away while watching anime, I will not understand what's going on. I'll be honest. I did always think it was cool. Like a lot of my friends who have really loved anime, especially at like a younger age, they ended up picking up how to read Japanese and speak the language.
[00:42:24.830] And some of my friends have even like gone to visit Japan and they were like, yeah, the knowledge that I have that was jumpstarted from my love for anime. I was able to like use that and actually like live there or like be there for long periods of time and communicate with people. And I was like, dude, this is like every Asian mom's dream. You know what I mean? Like having your kid pick up a language to the point where they're like almost fluent. So I guess that's like the takeaway. Like make your kids watch anime and maybe they'll learn Japanese.
[00:42:53.710] And then they can be your tour guide in Japan. True. True. I think I have to try harder. All right. Well, this was a fun conversation about anime, especially as someone who doesn't know too much about it and has only watched very select few about it. It was fun to discuss kind of how anime has played a role in our lives and how we've unknowingly been enjoying anime all of our lives.
