[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:14.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are nearing the end of summer but we can't end summer without discussing
[00:00:22.290] [SPEAKER_00]: brat summer. So I'm sure a lot of people have maybe heard this word getting tossed around lately,
[00:00:30.470] [SPEAKER_00]: especially on social media and I feel like it kind of epitomizes current slang and where it's at.
[00:00:38.070] [SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about brat. The origin of it is Charlie XCX's album, literally named Brett
[00:00:44.790] [SPEAKER_00]: and it's so iconic because it's just brat and the most basic font all lower case on a like lime green background.
[00:00:53.330] [SPEAKER_01]: And that album cover is so recognizable because my commute to San Francisco,
[00:00:59.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I would always drive by this one wall and it would have Brett in that lime green,
[00:01:04.670] [SPEAKER_01]: the lower case text on the wall. I guess like some sort of marketing for the album or something.
[00:01:09.330] [SPEAKER_01]: But the moment I saw it, I could not stop thinking about it and something like the color was just so
[00:01:14.990] [SPEAKER_01]: fresh. I was like yeah, Brett, like I love this. I don't know what it is but I'm in.
[00:01:20.990] [SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also such a statement. You're like, what is Brett? Right. This is this mean.
[00:01:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's actually part of the huge fun and debate of this word that has turned from
[00:01:33.130] [SPEAKER_00]: a simple album music album into a whole almost want to call it like a cultural movement.
[00:01:41.590] [SPEAKER_00]: It's just been like taking over things and I think it's really funny because people
[00:01:45.370] [SPEAKER_00]: definitely debate if things are brat or not. And also it fundamentally changed the word to.
[00:01:51.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Brett is an adjective instead of like, bratty. It's like it's brat.
[00:01:57.690] [SPEAKER_01]: And I've liked the concept of Brett is so funny too because like you said,
[00:02:02.170] [SPEAKER_01]: it's something that people I guess are continually defining. So if you look up articles about
[00:02:07.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Brett summer instead of clearly defining what brat means, it'll be like,
[00:02:12.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Brett is a strappy white tank top with no bra. Oh my god. Brett is smoking cigarettes by the beach.
[00:02:19.110] [SPEAKER_01]: It's really just vibes only. No real definition of it. Although if I were to really like try to
[00:02:25.770] [SPEAKER_00]: put it into words, I think some words that come to mind are like bold doing whatever you want,
[00:02:31.770] [SPEAKER_01]: not giving a fuck kind of attitude. Yeah and I think it also evokes kind of a grungy party aesthetic
[00:02:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: a little bit. So one of the things that I saw when doing some brat research was someone labeled
[00:02:44.810] [SPEAKER_01]: Brett summer as the opposite movement to the clean girl aesthetic. And I was like, yeah that makes sense.
[00:02:50.910] [SPEAKER_01]: That does make sense. Smudgy, gel eyeliner vibes instead of like perfect, slick back bun vibes.
[00:02:57.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Like you were doing something. You can tell you you had fun and were like engaging in
[00:03:03.390] [SPEAKER_01]: activity. Right. Well I do have a question for you on the topic of Brett. Do you think you
[00:03:10.070] [SPEAKER_00]: have been having a brat summer this year? Oh, actually I saw a meme that I think is relatable.
[00:03:17.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Brat summer except I'm staying inside in a sleep by nine. That's kind of me except
[00:03:24.370] [SPEAKER_00]: minus the sleep by nine part, but just brat summer except I'm staying inside. I don't know if my
[00:03:32.110] [SPEAKER_01]: but my attitude towards life has been totally brat. Okay, then that counts. You've been having a brat
[00:03:38.730] [SPEAKER_00]: summer. True. Although I will say maybe your lie has been brat. August has been more calm,
[00:03:44.490] [SPEAKER_01]: but your lie was definitely brat. You know that's a good point actually. July was very brat.
[00:03:51.450] [SPEAKER_00]: But August is demure. August were like gathering ourselves to get back into the swing of things
[00:03:58.870] [SPEAKER_00]: for September. Not that we're in school or anything, but it just feels like the start of
[00:04:03.670] [SPEAKER_01]: something new. Totally feel that although it does make me a little bit sad because brat
[00:04:08.830] [SPEAKER_01]: summer is such a iconic concept that I'm like worried. I'm like is brat summer only destined for
[00:04:16.190] [SPEAKER_01]: summer of 2024. Are we fucked for next summer? Not to be remembered. I wonder if we'll just
[00:04:23.250] [SPEAKER_00]: evolve it to like, you know, brat fall, brat winter, brat year, the bratism. Because also I think
[00:04:29.890] [SPEAKER_00]: people don't necessarily add, you know, the and modifier to it. Sometimes they're just like,
[00:04:35.390] [SPEAKER_00]: oh that's brat. And I think some of the funny and simple ones are like if anything is
[00:04:40.750] [SPEAKER_00]: limed green or any sort of like bright green people will be like, oh that's brat. I saw funny
[00:04:47.170] [SPEAKER_00]: one that was like the picture of one of the New York subways, the G-line which is notoriously
[00:04:53.710] [SPEAKER_00]: unreliable and it's also one of the green colored lines. The tweet was like this diva right here.
[00:04:59.770] [SPEAKER_00]: She's truly having a brat summer not working taking time off to vibe until Labor Day.
[00:05:05.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, brat isn't attitude. Actually it's a lifestyle. Yeah, so hopefully it's with us for good.
[00:05:11.790] [SPEAKER_00]: Should we be getting like some lime green t-shirts to wear? With brat on it or no brat. What's
[00:05:19.110] [SPEAKER_00]: brat year? Without brat because then it's a if you know, you know, such a way. Oh, true. It's like
[00:05:25.690] [SPEAKER_01]: real brats would understand. So actually our topic today gives me a little bit of brat energy
[00:05:33.610] [SPEAKER_01]: because we wanted to talk a bit about dealing with people you dislike. I guess this makes it sound
[00:05:41.970] [SPEAKER_01]: super negative, but it doesn't always have to be someone you like hate, but maybe it's just someone that
[00:05:48.930] [SPEAKER_01]: you have had negative experiences within the past and you have to continually see or something like
[00:05:54.410] [SPEAKER_01]: that. So we really just wanted to sit down and chat through our techniques, our warning signs
[00:06:00.630] [SPEAKER_01]: and any sort of reversals that we've seen in the past as well. So I guess the first question here
[00:06:05.510] [SPEAKER_00]: is like, how does this like maybe start for you? Where does it usually root from?
[00:06:11.090] [SPEAKER_01]: I think for the most part when you meet people in an interact with them,
[00:06:16.550] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of people tend to stay in the midsection where it's not really like you like them,
[00:06:23.990] [SPEAKER_01]: but you also don't dislike them. You're just neutral. At the end of the day, even if you have
[00:06:29.270] [SPEAKER_01]: a couple of conversations with someone, you might not really know them. So I feel most people
[00:06:34.110] [SPEAKER_01]: stay in that neutral slash in a offensive range. But I definitely have had my fair share of
[00:06:42.050] [SPEAKER_01]: people that I dislike and it's kind of hard to categorize because I think some of them there is
[00:06:47.690] [SPEAKER_01]: like something. Maybe there's an event that happens, there's something that I catch that I find is
[00:06:53.250] [SPEAKER_01]: slightly weird or off putting about them but sometimes it's like honestly just kind of based on
[00:06:59.250] [SPEAKER_01]: vibes which sounds a little horrible, but it's almost like an instinctive like yeah we're like
[00:07:05.170] [SPEAKER_01]: super different and not in a way that is positive. Right because so it's not necessarily like
[00:07:11.990] [SPEAKER_00]: a dislike but it's just like oh this isn't something I'm used to. So you have like a weird
[00:07:17.970] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling about it maybe that's just not necessarily positive. Yeah I'm like maybe the
[00:07:23.550] [SPEAKER_01]: better way of thinking about it is instead of oh I dislike you it's kind of like if I had to categorize
[00:07:29.650] [SPEAKER_01]: between yes and no I would probably put you in no. Mm yes I think I understand like you
[00:07:34.810] [SPEAKER_00]: probably wouldn't have hung out with this person if not for mutual friends. Mm I think I'm
[00:07:40.110] [SPEAKER_00]: probably similar to you maybe if someone is kind of rude or like makes me feel uncomfortable then
[00:07:47.190] [SPEAKER_00]: I would also kind of like fall into that oh I like I want to stay away from this person you know.
[00:07:53.570] [SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's also sometimes just like an unfair position where like let's say I'm just in a
[00:07:58.890] [SPEAKER_00]: terrible mood and I just hate everyone. If you are in that unfortunate situation and have caught
[00:08:04.710] [SPEAKER_00]: me in a terrible mood then like I'm sorry I might just like instinctually dislike everyone around
[00:08:11.050] [SPEAKER_00]: me and that impression just stays in my brain for a certain reason. No honestly you bring up a
[00:08:17.290] [SPEAKER_01]: good point because dislike isn't always justified and another example that I can think of kind of
[00:08:28.870] [SPEAKER_01]: people right and say one group of people are being super loud and obnoxious and you're kind of
[00:08:34.730] [SPEAKER_01]: in your quiet era so then you might be like oh that group of people they're not my vibe. When
[00:08:40.290] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe on an individual level like you would totally get along but because of the circumstances
[00:08:45.590] [SPEAKER_00]: they're like temporarily slotted as disliked. Mm so true this can even happen with good friend
[00:08:51.210] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe you know we're hanging out and half of the people are just like super super energetic and
[00:08:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]: being really loud in that moment you're like you're one of my best friends but like I dislike you right
[00:09:02.590] [SPEAKER_01]: now. That's very true which I guess just goes to show it's not always like super personal sometimes
[00:09:09.470] [SPEAKER_01]: it is just like case by case situation yeah but I do want to ask when you have these feelings of
[00:09:17.170] [SPEAKER_01]: dislike do you think it's obvious to the people around you that you might potentially dislike someone
[00:09:26.430] [SPEAKER_00]: um I feel like if you know me yes and maybe you can confirm or deny this but I feel like it's
[00:09:36.570] [SPEAKER_00]: not too difficult to tell with me I'll probably just be more quiet or reserved around you.
[00:09:43.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I've definitely seen that I'm like love out like internally love because I think there's two
[00:09:54.650] [SPEAKER_01]: they will know and you will like let them know and the other type is like I'm just going to crawl
[00:09:59.590] [SPEAKER_01]: back into my shell until like I am removed from this situation or something. I can't decide sometimes
[00:10:06.190] [SPEAKER_00]: because it's like on a certain level treating everyone with you know respect and kindness is
[00:10:13.710] [SPEAKER_00]: nice I think but you know maybe if you dislike someone if you treat them like that are people like
[00:10:19.530] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god you're so fake because you were so nice to me and then you turn around and like should
[00:10:23.630] [SPEAKER_00]: talk to your friends or something right but then I'm like I don't know I wouldn't want to like
[00:10:28.730] [SPEAKER_00]: treat you poorly either just because like maybe you rub me the wrong way because of a certain thing.
[00:10:34.510] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point I guess there's like a fine line where you can be polite and tactful without
[00:10:41.550] [SPEAKER_01]: necessarily like showering them with compliments or something like that but I feel like when you're
[00:10:45.650] [SPEAKER_01]: actually in that social situation it can be sort of hard to gauge but at the end of the day
[00:10:50.970] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe the best solution is always to kind of slowly fade away into the background and you know
[00:10:56.570] [SPEAKER_00]: have like a short polite but short conversation yeah yeah I think I tend to try to keep our interaction
[00:11:04.390] [SPEAKER_00]: pretty short but you know I don't want it to be a negative interaction so I try to keep it pretty like
[00:11:10.610] [SPEAKER_00]: neutral to positive but yeah it's difficult because sometimes you know at the end of the day
[00:11:16.250] [SPEAKER_00]: you vent to your friends you're like oh actually like you know this person robs me the wrong way
[00:11:20.730] [SPEAKER_00]: but like whatever I mean in high school years that would obviously very easily become blown out
[00:11:27.070] [SPEAKER_00]: of proportion right though oh my god this person thinks oh a bitch or whatever right but I think
[00:11:31.970] [SPEAKER_01]: it's just like it's natural you can't like everyone totally I'm trying to think if it's obvious
[00:11:37.790] [SPEAKER_01]: when I dislike someone I think they're probably times where it is really obvious but I've been working
[00:11:45.090] [SPEAKER_01]: on trying to hide it a little bit better yeah so I think in more recent years my skills on
[00:11:51.690] [SPEAKER_00]: hiding it happen improving I think you're pretty good at hiding it for the most part oh really
[00:11:56.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I think like with your game face-on for like a social event you can definitely match everyone's vibes
[00:12:04.010] [SPEAKER_00]: happy vibes wait okay that makes me very happy actually it's working to be fair I think if there's
[00:12:12.490] [SPEAKER_00]: people who we don't vibe with as much we're not you know voluntarily trying to put them in an
[00:12:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable situation to like hang out with us yeah so there's also that that's true it's
[00:12:23.610] [SPEAKER_01]: definitely getting rare and rare to like have these interactions with people we might potentially
[00:12:28.010] [SPEAKER_01]: dislike because it's so curated now it's like you see who you want to see okay what if you
[00:12:33.850] [SPEAKER_00]: maybe don't love someone but they like really like you
[00:12:40.590] [SPEAKER_01]: has that ever happened do maybe back in school this was like a little bit more common
[00:12:46.450] [SPEAKER_01]: but it's definitely a hard situation to navigate I feel like it adds to the guilt a little bit more
[00:12:53.110] [SPEAKER_01]: instead of just being like oh I would prefer not to see someone it's like I would prefer not to see
[00:12:57.750] [SPEAKER_01]: them and on top of that I have all these shitty feelings like storming around it's like my friend
[00:13:04.370] [SPEAKER_00]: I think this did kind of happen to me but it's a little like different but um I was on this
[00:13:12.390] [SPEAKER_00]: like group trip and there was this person who honestly I would say we like we were friends like we
[00:13:17.010] [SPEAKER_00]: got along well together but there was like a moment of annoyance so I guess like in that moment
[00:13:24.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I disliked them for a bit and it's such a stupid thing too it was like later on the trip
[00:13:31.070] [SPEAKER_00]: we were all on the bus going from like destination A to B and I was sitting next to my friend
[00:13:37.370] [SPEAKER_00]: and then I guess like they fell asleep and then they like fell onto my shoulder
[00:13:43.530] [SPEAKER_00]: dude I don't know I was like an angsty teen or whatever but also I think it was like a surprise
[00:13:48.770] [SPEAKER_00]: in the moment I was like oh my personal space has just been invaded without any like prior
[00:13:55.510] [SPEAKER_00]: acknowledgement but also it's like I can't do anything about it because they're just sleeping
[00:14:00.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to like wake them up and be like don't fucking sleep on my shoulder
[00:14:08.050] [SPEAKER_00]: honestly there's like no harm or anything but I think it's like the the surprise
[00:14:13.130] [SPEAKER_00]: traveling being a you know new place jet lag tired all of that added up and in that moment
[00:14:19.930] [SPEAKER_00]: I was annoyed and I actually thought about it a lot after that happened like sometimes I still
[00:14:24.930] [SPEAKER_01]: think about it I'm like what was that so annoyed? I think so much of what we consider dislike
[00:14:34.130] [SPEAKER_01]: or like annoyance is unexplainable you know it's like so many factors combined into like one
[00:14:41.810] [SPEAKER_01]: flash of like a rage or something but I feel like I've also had moments where I'm like
[00:14:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]: suddenly I don't like hang out with this person dude it's like completely irrational and I'm like okay
[00:14:52.370] [SPEAKER_01]: no it's shitty but I still feel it you know I guess maybe part of this could be your social
[00:14:58.550] [SPEAKER_00]: battery is truly drained and you haven't recognized it yet and then this flash of annoyance or
[00:15:04.350] [SPEAKER_00]: anger is like one of the signs because on that trip I think I was in high school you know I might not
[00:15:10.690] [SPEAKER_00]: have been as like self-aware and then also we were all just a bunch of you know like teenage kids
[00:15:17.910] [SPEAKER_00]: this trip was like one or two weeks long and we all had to like share rooms as well for our room
[00:15:25.550] [SPEAKER_00]: and bored and I'm definitely an introvert you know I know now that I really appreciate it when I
[00:15:31.310] [SPEAKER_00]: have time to recharge that social battery so just thinking back on that trip I'm like yeah it's
[00:15:35.910] [SPEAKER_00]: super fun but I was probably like dying at the end like where can I just sit by myself to like recover
[00:15:41.910] [SPEAKER_00]: every single waking moment otherwise I was like with people yeah that's really tough and I
[00:15:47.750] [SPEAKER_01]: think like especially when we're young hormones are raging there's like all this academic pressure
[00:15:52.730] [SPEAKER_01]: on your shoulders or just you know like the whole future is in front of you and you're like at such
[00:15:57.910] [SPEAKER_01]: an inflection point in your life now beginning these social situations is not as easy because like
[00:16:04.450] [SPEAKER_01]: you said now that we're older like we know our preferences and to a certain extent we also know our
[00:16:09.390] [SPEAKER_01]: limits like I know I can't hang out with someone too many consecutive days in a row otherwise
[00:16:15.710] [SPEAKER_01]: I'll start going crazy so then back then I feel like we didn't really know that so then
[00:16:21.470] [SPEAKER_01]: I remember like some revocations and stuff every single day we would hang out and then I would be like
[00:16:26.950] [SPEAKER_01]: why am I starting to feel like annoyed all the time instead of thinking oh maybe this is like too much
[00:16:32.290] [SPEAKER_00]: hanging out yeah for sure but do you think like in terms of these you know whether it's a flash of like
[00:16:39.850] [SPEAKER_00]: annoyance or dislike in the moment or maybe like a poor first impression have you ever been
[00:16:44.810] [SPEAKER_00]: able to like overlook that or like turn it around and then turn this situation into actually a very
[00:16:51.910] [SPEAKER_01]: positive friendship honestly yeah I can definitely think of maybe like a few key people
[00:16:58.970] [SPEAKER_01]: where maybe my first impression or like first interaction with them was not super positive and then
[00:17:04.590] [SPEAKER_01]: I left that interaction being like oh that was weird like hopefully I don't have to talk to this
[00:17:09.910] [SPEAKER_01]: person again but after conversation to conversation three I was like wait this person is awesome
[00:17:16.110] [SPEAKER_01]: and you know maybe in that moment where I was first talking to them I could have been looking for
[00:17:22.070] [SPEAKER_01]: something specific like you know how sometimes you're in that era where you're like I want to
[00:17:27.030] [SPEAKER_01]: have deep talks or like sometimes you're like I don't want to have deep talks like I just want
[00:17:30.310] [SPEAKER_01]: to have fun right now like you know depending on what you want in that moment I feel like that's kind
[00:17:34.570] [SPEAKER_01]: of like the great book that you use to evaluate your interaction with someone so then over time when
[00:17:41.090] [SPEAKER_01]: the sample size croaks maybe it kind of like evens out a little right like you start to see them
[00:17:46.390] [SPEAKER_00]: as a whole person versus just that one like instance of them yeah also the other thing too is I
[00:17:53.350] [SPEAKER_01]: feel like for most people myself completely included there's like specific environments where they're
[00:17:58.770] [SPEAKER_01]: most fun or like they're the most themselves I realize I don't love lunch dates but if we grab
[00:18:06.510] [SPEAKER_01]: coffee or like grab a drink or something I feel like that's something that I prefer a little bit more
[00:18:11.590] [SPEAKER_00]: wow good to know I think we've had a lunch date before well it wasn't just us too oh my god that was
[00:18:19.730] [SPEAKER_01]: fine that was one no just like some lunches I just can't do it like oh a lunch no lunch dates
[00:18:28.750] [SPEAKER_00]: would be soon me crossing out every potential like I'm just gonna cancel these yeah but I think that's
[00:18:39.090] [SPEAKER_00]: totally fair for example I'm not a morning person so if someone was like crystal let's grab like
[00:18:44.070] [SPEAKER_00]: early breakfast I would probably be like I would literally rather die like you're like I can't think
[00:18:51.490] [SPEAKER_00]: anything I want to do less yeah like you're telling me I need a wake up at six a.m. to eat food
[00:18:57.430] [SPEAKER_01]: when I could just sleep and eat later oh my god so you know like if someone were to first meet me
[00:19:05.390] [SPEAKER_01]: at lunch or first meet you at breakfast they might be like these girls are whack yeah yeah this is
[00:19:12.090] [SPEAKER_00]: why it's like the only time I can do a morning meal with people a social morning meal
[00:19:17.610] [SPEAKER_00]: is if it's brunch and usually alcohol is involved then I'm tolerable but that's it yeah that's
[00:19:24.930] [SPEAKER_00]: the earliest you can go when my boyfriend and I first started dating I told him I was like I'm not
[00:19:30.570] [SPEAKER_00]: really a morning person I definitely don't wake up early I guess the first time he witnessed it he was
[00:19:36.070] [SPEAKER_00]: like oh you really aren't a morning person he's like you're super grumpy in the morning just I was like yeah
[00:19:44.510] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm not my best self and it is kind of funny though because you know there's been social situations
[00:19:51.510] [SPEAKER_01]: where I've showed up and on the way home I'm like that wasn't like the best impression of me
[00:19:57.870] [SPEAKER_01]: because I'm tired because I just had this stressful thing and blah blah like there's always reasons why
[00:20:03.530] [SPEAKER_01]: you are a certain way at any sort of event I think true but it's not like other people know that
[00:20:09.130] [SPEAKER_01]: so I guess the learning here is maybe when I judge people on like oh this person was being so
[00:20:13.770] [SPEAKER_01]: extra this person was being so why there's all these personal reasons that they might have had
[00:20:18.310] [SPEAKER_00]: but I would have like no clue about yeah that's a really good point like not every day is going
[00:20:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]: to be everyone's best day of their life right and I think we've talked about this a really long time
[00:20:28.490] [SPEAKER_00]: ago on the podcast but first impressions are truly like not indicative of what a person is like
[00:20:35.350] [SPEAKER_00]: so you know if you meet a person one time and you hit it off that's amazing but if you don't
[00:20:40.310] [SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't necessarily mean that that's who they are all the time yeah one of the things that I've
[00:20:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]: been trying to be a little bit more conscious of now in my late 20s is I really sometimes when
[00:20:53.890] [SPEAKER_01]: I dislike someone it's also like me just projecting my insecurities on to them for example
[00:20:59.890] [SPEAKER_01]: I can be fairly awkward sometimes and like anxious it's not a quality that I like love about myself
[00:21:07.710] [SPEAKER_01]: and it's definitely something that when it comes up I'm like oh god like here we go again
[00:21:12.010] [SPEAKER_01]: so sometimes when I see someone and I can like sniff out similarities between us especially
[00:21:19.650] [SPEAKER_01]: similarities of qualities that I dislike about myself I think I sometimes interpret that as oh I
[00:21:26.350] [SPEAKER_01]: don't really vibe with this person when that's not really fair it's all like I don't vibe
[00:21:31.830] [SPEAKER_01]: with this person it's more like I don't vibe with myself and this person is like collateral damage
[00:21:38.450] [SPEAKER_01]: from why negative feelings about myself they're catching strays yeah so when I was younger
[00:21:44.990] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I really realize this but now that I'm older I'm like okay that's like kind of shitty
[00:21:50.670] [SPEAKER_01]: so if I'm able to recognize it I try to kind of stray away from these negative feelings or like
[00:21:56.730] [SPEAKER_01]: at least talk myself out of it like oh you're just projecting your own insecurities like it's
[00:22:00.850] [SPEAKER_00]: this person's fall that's such a good point I think I can completely relate it's like this
[00:22:06.950] [SPEAKER_00]: person is just too real like you're facing everything that you don't like about yourself you're
[00:22:11.690] [SPEAKER_00]: like how could I possibly like this person right but in the moment you just don't realize
[00:22:16.790] [SPEAKER_00]: that's what's happening that amir is actually just put in front of you but I think another aspect
[00:22:23.570] [SPEAKER_00]: of that is maybe in the moment you're feeling insecure because of I don't know anxiety or
[00:22:31.490] [SPEAKER_00]: you had a bad day and then you project that onto the people that you met it's like oh because this
[00:22:37.390] [SPEAKER_00]: was a bad day everyone else is colored in like a more negative light when you know if it was a good
[00:22:42.750] [SPEAKER_01]: day like you would have loved everyone true and I feel like this can also extend to on feelings
[00:22:49.090] [SPEAKER_01]: that you have about other people this is a little bit immature but it's like you know when you go
[00:22:54.550] [SPEAKER_01]: to meet your friends friends and you might only know your friend who invited you but your friend
[00:23:00.450] [SPEAKER_01]: knows like this entire group of people who have their own inside jokes and whatever with your
[00:23:05.350] [SPEAKER_01]: friend like I feel like in moments like that I like have to actively talk myself out of okay like
[00:23:11.750] [SPEAKER_01]: it's okay that this person has other friends you know like you don't have to be insecure about it
[00:23:17.530] [SPEAKER_01]: like you don't have to be jealous and at the very least don't let this jealousy turn until dislike or
[00:23:23.650] [SPEAKER_01]: something and I feel like this sounds very high school but you know all the honest like I still
[00:23:29.230] [SPEAKER_01]: feel feelings like this well into my 20s instead of like denying these feelings I guess the
[00:23:35.430] [SPEAKER_01]: solution is more to just knock it off as soon as you search a sense of it to like face it
[00:23:41.660] [SPEAKER_00]: and like deal with it yeah exactly but then you're like oh this is so difficult
[00:23:49.240] [SPEAKER_01]: I know it really is hard I think the easy thing to do is just be like yeah I fucking hate
[00:23:53.820] [SPEAKER_00]: everyone here I mean that's like I feel like that's bra damn that is bra
[00:24:04.000] [SPEAKER_00]: and on that topic I think that it's also more accepted now for people to I guess like not openly hate
[00:24:12.760] [SPEAKER_00]: people but like express their dislike of people or situations it's more of a like yeah you don't
[00:24:19.620] [SPEAKER_00]: have to pretend you just like everything it's okay to be like oh yeah I don't vibe with this person
[00:24:25.320] [SPEAKER_00]: as much so I would prefer to like hang out with these other friends that I like more I love that
[00:24:31.400] [SPEAKER_01]: acting out is an option like you can always feel free to opt out of stuff yeah I guess like part
[00:24:38.180] [SPEAKER_00]: of it is being an apologetic which is you know part of being brat too but of course at the
[00:24:45.320] [SPEAKER_00]: same time as we talked about I don't know it's like such a fine line right because it's like yeah
[00:24:49.400] [SPEAKER_00]: you can openly admit that maybe you dislike you know certain people or things but also like you
[00:24:54.740] [SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be too rude about it I guess so you don't want to be giving them a horrible time
[00:24:58.780] [SPEAKER_01]: just because of your own preference and honestly I feel like it's not super uncommon to have
[00:25:05.460] [SPEAKER_01]: to interact with someone that you might not really like and there's a lot of techniques that you can
[00:25:11.120] [SPEAKER_01]: use I feel like one easy go two thing is humor maybe you can try to see if there's some
[00:25:18.200] [SPEAKER_01]: level of humor that you and this person kind of can meet each other or and then just push that instead
[00:25:23.720] [SPEAKER_01]: of trying to have serious conversations or like something that doesn't seem to work with this person
[00:25:28.600] [SPEAKER_01]: you can just try to make things lighter and make it funny and like cracks and jokes yeah true
[00:25:34.300] [SPEAKER_00]: and I guess like you know ultimately ideal here is you just try to limit your interaction so that
[00:25:40.620] [SPEAKER_00]: no one has to deal with the shitty situation of spending time with people they might not want to
[00:25:47.150] [SPEAKER_00]: but what if and this is probably a very difficult question what if it's someone you see a lot
[00:25:55.070] [SPEAKER_00]: because of maybe mutual friends or history of friendship have you ever had to like deal with that
[00:26:02.290] [SPEAKER_01]: so definitely not in recent years but I think back in high school and college this was way more common
[00:26:09.990] [SPEAKER_01]: and if you like there's like only two paths out that I have seen so one is like you said limit
[00:26:18.510] [SPEAKER_01]: all interaction but this can be kind of hard say this person is in your friend group or something
[00:26:24.690] [SPEAKER_01]: and you guys always hang out you can't just like ignore one person out of however many people
[00:26:30.330] [SPEAKER_01]: they're like that's just weird and not only is it weird for both of you it's also weird for
[00:26:34.770] [SPEAKER_01]: everyone else around you true so if you're unable to like avoid conversation with them I feel like
[00:26:41.050] [SPEAKER_01]: the next best way is find one thing and then every time you see them you like talk about that one
[00:26:47.010] [SPEAKER_01]: thing and then you just leave it at that so I'll be like talking yeah but you can just be like
[00:26:51.690] [SPEAKER_01]: how's your dog and then that's it you like walk away after the conversation but at least you
[00:26:56.110] [SPEAKER_00]: talked you know right right right basically put in some effort to be cordial yeah I feel like dislike
[00:27:02.910] [SPEAKER_01]: to can be general but sometimes it's also like specific like you might not like a specific person
[00:27:08.870] [SPEAKER_01]: when they drink or you might not like a specific person when they play sports or like talk about
[00:27:14.510] [SPEAKER_01]: politics or something so then you just identify what the pain points are and then like steer
[00:27:19.050] [SPEAKER_00]: clear as far as possible that's true and I think it would be fair if say like a conversation
[00:27:24.630] [SPEAKER_00]: topic came up and you're like oh guys I don't want to talk about this and then you know try to like
[00:27:30.190] [SPEAKER_00]: avoid that discomfort right have you ever been in a situation like that I think luckily not in a
[00:27:39.110] [SPEAKER_00]: situation where like I've had to constantly see someone who I don't want to okay honestly I think
[00:27:50.350] [SPEAKER_00]: I very luckily don't have like intense hatred for anyone but you know maybe like a minor dislike
[00:27:57.090] [SPEAKER_00]: if I can avoid it like I'll try not to hang out with this person as much but I think in the few
[00:28:03.110] [SPEAKER_00]: times that I do I just try my best to like enjoy the moment you know like don't let this
[00:28:10.350] [SPEAKER_00]: feeling ruin the night for everyone that kind of feeling and I think it usually tends to help
[00:28:16.690] [SPEAKER_00]: and when you try to keep a more positive mindset I think it does help you see like the good sides
[00:28:24.150] [SPEAKER_00]: of that person that you dislike as well I mean like you know that doesn't mean that it has to
[00:28:29.770] [SPEAKER_00]: change necessarily like oh suddenly I love them now but I think it just helps you get through
[00:28:35.370] [SPEAKER_00]: that moment like just don't let your dislike consume you and try to just like let go of some
[00:28:42.090] [SPEAKER_00]: of that you know control I guess just like whatever like everyone's just here to have fun
[00:28:47.450] [SPEAKER_01]: yeah actually that's a really good point because I feel like the more you get to know someone
[00:28:52.410] [SPEAKER_01]: it's harder and harder to dislike them which is why maybe sometimes it's a harder of a hill
[00:28:58.030] [SPEAKER_01]: to start disliking like a family member or something because you know so much about them and they're
[00:29:03.450] [SPEAKER_01]: like upbringing and they're like background and whatnot and maybe that's also why it's like
[00:29:09.390] [SPEAKER_01]: easy to hype on the hate train of someone you like barely know because you don't know like redeeming
[00:29:14.730] [SPEAKER_00]: qualities about them that's true that's true and I think you can totally see that in media too like
[00:29:21.110] [SPEAKER_00]: there's social media stars or celebrities or something we only know so much about this person right
[00:29:26.230] [SPEAKER_00]: whatever is put out into the media for everyone to see and so it's really easy for people to form
[00:29:32.610] [SPEAKER_00]: opinions when like we don't actually know that person true and I feel like this is why gossip
[00:29:39.590] [SPEAKER_01]: when you're older is like a little bit less serious than it was when you're younger like I don't
[00:29:51.090] [SPEAKER_01]: crazy or like I can't believe this person did that and then now I'm probably more likely to take it
[00:29:57.050] [SPEAKER_01]: with a grain of salt we might have fun and like gossip about it but I'm not gonna like go home thinking
[00:30:02.730] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah this person is like truly a horrible person yeah you're so right I was thinking of the exact same
[00:30:08.550] [SPEAKER_00]: term like I would take gossip with a grain of salt or I feel like sometimes what's really juicy
[00:30:14.230] [SPEAKER_00]: about a piece of gossip is the situation and then maybe that kicks off the conversation
[00:30:20.630] [SPEAKER_00]: and then it evolves into like hypotheticals like wow what would we do if we were in this situation
[00:30:25.790] [SPEAKER_00]: it like goes beyond just their original little piece of gossip right but this does bring me to ask
[00:30:32.290] [SPEAKER_01]: because going back to how gossip felt super serious kind of in high school I feel like the
[00:30:38.790] [SPEAKER_01]: other thing in high school that was big was if your friend hates someone then you are like send me
[00:30:46.450] [SPEAKER_01]: obligated to hate them as well so were you or are you currently a believer that you're obligated
[00:30:52.870] [SPEAKER_00]: to hate the people your friends hate who I think I was in high school and I think it comes from
[00:30:59.390] [SPEAKER_00]: the place of like I want to support my friend right so if they're like oh my god this person was
[00:31:04.570] [SPEAKER_00]: bothering me I don't like them then you're like oh yeah you're totally in the right you're
[00:31:09.410] [SPEAKER_00]: valid blah blah blah I think that's where it kind of comes from and I think also it's a little
[00:31:13.710] [SPEAKER_00]: different because you know when we're in that age range a big thing that we're worried about is like
[00:31:19.750] [SPEAKER_00]: oh I want to fit in I want to have friends I want to have like a place where I feel comfortable
[00:31:24.170] [SPEAKER_00]: so sometimes you even just like brainwash yourself into thinking like I have to
[00:31:34.550] [SPEAKER_00]: think right so I think as we've gone older maybe not as much but I think it still leaves an
[00:31:43.450] [SPEAKER_00]: impression on me like if someone were to say oh my god this person was like so rude that
[00:31:48.350] [SPEAKER_00]: becomes my first impression of them and so rather than them starting at like a neutral
[00:31:54.030] [SPEAKER_00]: for me when I meet them next time they're like ever so slightly in the negative. I don't want
[00:32:01.350] [SPEAKER_00]: they were rude to my friend that's basically an interaction with me. I totally feel that actually
[00:32:07.810] [SPEAKER_01]: I was also very much in the camp of like if you wrong my friend you have wronged me back in high
[00:32:14.170] [SPEAKER_01]: school and honestly probably most of college as well so I kind of saw it as like a stamp of loyalty
[00:32:20.530] [SPEAKER_01]: thing which thinking back that's not really how it works but of course there's also a difference
[00:32:26.770] [SPEAKER_01]: between whether someone was mildly annoying to your friend and whether they were like truly
[00:32:31.610] [SPEAKER_01]: offensive and like bothersome to your friend as well. Yes very true but yeah agree that in adulthood
[00:32:37.990] [SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't feel as like okay my bestie hates this person therefore I do too but I will say like
[00:32:45.050] [SPEAKER_01]: if you and your friend have similar preferences or similar like values and stuff I think it does
[00:32:50.810] [SPEAKER_01]: still kind of end up that way. Like you might generally like or dislike similar groups of people
[00:32:56.630] [SPEAKER_00]: agreed and I think you're right to that if like someone truly did wrong your friend and like
[00:33:02.090] [SPEAKER_00]: you know did horrible things to them did stuff that had horrible lasting impact. I would definitely
[00:33:07.790] [SPEAKER_00]: lean towards the oh yeah I probably hate this person too but this does kind of remind me of like
[00:33:14.950] [SPEAKER_00]: the funny situation when it's like you know maybe you didn't really vibe with someone at a party
[00:33:19.930] [SPEAKER_00]: or at a social gathering and you didn't ask one of your good friends yet how they feel about
[00:33:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]: that person and you're trying to gauge like oh shoot did they actually it's like this person
[00:33:30.810] [SPEAKER_00]: or or are we allowed to like discuss why they rubbed me the wrong way right and it's like
[00:33:38.050] [SPEAKER_00]: you're towing the line you're like yeah um so what do you think about so and so
[00:33:44.130] [SPEAKER_00]: did you get a chance to like talk to them? Oh like who is going to be the first one to break
[00:33:49.110] [SPEAKER_00]: the wall and be like oh my god like they did this really rude thing to me and yeah I don't
[00:33:53.070] [SPEAKER_01]: know how to feel about them because you don't want to be the one who's like god wasn't that guy so
[00:33:58.210] [SPEAKER_01]: weird and then your friend's like oh I thought he was really cool yeah like a great conversation
[00:34:02.830] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah because then part of it you're like oh shit it must be me like I need to check myself like
[00:34:07.450] [SPEAKER_01]: why am I hating on these people? Exactly although I feel like there's always a key word to like
[00:34:16.150] [SPEAKER_01]: out for anytime someone's like yeah that was interesting or like he's interesting I feel like
[00:34:21.950] [SPEAKER_01]: it usually opens the door just a little bit of like shit talk territory and like the tone
[00:34:27.490] [SPEAKER_00]: of voice as well the pauses like he was interesting versus he was interesting but you know
[00:34:37.010] [SPEAKER_01]: all this to say I will be the first swim I'm not above a good shit talk set sometimes it just clears
[00:34:44.650] [SPEAKER_01]: the mind and it doesn't even have to be like deep from your soul it's just like light
[00:34:49.950] [SPEAKER_00]: goss and then you like move on with your life sometimes it can be as simple as oh my god like
[00:34:54.550] [SPEAKER_00]: this person was so rude to me like they didn't respond when I tried to have a conversation with them
[00:35:00.710] [SPEAKER_00]: and you just need to like fend it out and then after that you're like okay I feel a lot better now
[00:35:06.990] [SPEAKER_01]: too and sometimes I kind of reset you until like neutral territory with that person again
[00:35:11.770] [SPEAKER_01]: like oh I like got my feelings about this out so next time I see him I won't feel like
[00:35:16.630] [SPEAKER_00]: resentment or anything true ultimately I guess like sometimes it sucks to admit or like just say
[00:35:22.650] [SPEAKER_00]: out loud but sometimes it is inevitable to feel that dislike and I don't know if I'm like seeing
[00:35:29.410] [SPEAKER_00]: this in the most understandable way but I just think there's like always gonna be some facet of you that
[00:35:36.590] [SPEAKER_00]: is gonna like cause someone else dislike you or you know someone else has some part that makes you
[00:35:43.310] [SPEAKER_00]: dislike them it's just like inevitable no two people are like 100% match everyone will always have
[00:35:49.650] [SPEAKER_00]: conflict somehow some way and I guess like the most we can do is just figure out how to deal with
[00:35:57.290] [SPEAKER_00]: it on our own side you know how to like owe it or like process that emotion or just avoid it if
[00:36:04.530] [SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna like bother you a lot it's funny talking to you about this because like you said
[00:36:10.830] [SPEAKER_01]: everyone has like one person or something or another that they dislike but the concept of disliking
[00:36:17.950] [SPEAKER_01]: people isn't really discussed like this yeah so then my personal takeaways is like one honestly
[00:36:25.290] [SPEAKER_01]: it's like unserious and like you said unavoidable twin extent so doesn't have to be like super emotional
[00:36:32.590] [SPEAKER_01]: to like dislike or get disliked by someone and two sometimes the root of the dislike is
[00:36:39.970] [SPEAKER_01]: from within you the color is coming from inside the house so if you are the problem recognize it
[00:36:47.370] [SPEAKER_01]: and just be like yeah I'm like a hater today or like I'm in my hater era so ignore me you know
[00:36:53.970] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah I totally agree sometimes you just got a fucking hater a little bit
[00:36:59.730] [SPEAKER_00]: but in a self-aware way yeah it would be impossible to never have negative emotions
[00:37:07.730] [SPEAKER_00]: sometimes an unfortunate bystander will take the brunt of your hater whether it's behind closed doors
[00:37:15.550] [SPEAKER_01]: or out in public yeah and like we said it might not always be permanent it might just be like a
[00:37:21.970] [SPEAKER_01]: very temporary feeling and then the next time you see this person you might be best friends it's not an
[00:37:27.870] [SPEAKER_01]: end all be all kind of situation either for sure so for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts
