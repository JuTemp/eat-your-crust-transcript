[00:00:00.050] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal Kind of crazy we've been doing this like understanding new slang Segment on the podcast for just about a year and a half now We've gone through a good chunk of words
[00:00:25.900] but what's truly fascinating is that some of these words have either evolved or Maybe even disappeared or are still being used just as much as when we first
[00:00:37.480] Discussed them. So we thought it would be fun to look back on the words that we've talked about and do a kind of award Ceremony slash superlatives for these slang words. So we wrote down some
[00:00:50.700] Superlatives slash awards to hand out. So the first one we wrote down is The fastest to die aka the one-hit wonder Okay, so I'm looking at our little list of slang words that we've covered and I feel like one that sticks out to me for this is
[00:01:10.940] Ageable which was I just burst out laughing Right, and I feel like cuz this one started almost as an averse reaction to Millennials saying lol all the time It never really had heart and soul in the word. You know what I mean?
[00:01:24.240] It was just like a response to our lol usage. Yeah, so I think ageable is definitely a one-hit wonder No one uses it anymore And I remember when we discussed this one
[00:01:33.000] We were like not even sure if it's a real slang word or if it was just some decoy to like throw off the Millennials exactly another one-hit wonder is probably understood the assignment
[00:01:47.760] I don't think I see that one around as much anymore and it's also very fitting for this category because It was originally from a song, right? True. So it actually is a one-hit wonder. Yeah, is there even like a replacement for understood the assignment?
[00:02:03.860] I guess it's just like eight. Yeah Which is way more succinct and way more emphatic so I think eight is a good substitute. Yeah, okay So another superlative which is kind of similar is you had to be there
[00:02:19.880] So maybe not like a one-hit wonder but it had its moment but now it's like not as applicable Okay, this one. I feel like the gritty so the gritty is Similar to understood the assignment tied to like a specific dance
[00:02:36.040] So then I feel like when this word was super popular or at least the dance was super popular It was like all I could see everywhere on tik-tok Instagram Twitter, etc
[00:02:45.640] And it was so good like you really truly just had to be there in that era that was like the funniest shit ever. Oh My god, okay. I think I have a word for this one as well
[00:02:57.360] Bombastic side-eye. Oh true. I guess this one could also feel one-hit wonder but I think it blew up Exponentially for a bit similar to the gritty. It was kind of everywhere for a bit now It's like not used at all and and it was a sound bit
[00:03:13.060] So I think that's like partially why it was so viral So it's kind of like if you never heard the sound bit, you know, you had to be there
[00:03:22.060] Okay now I'm thinking maybe if a word or like a slang word is really tied to like an audio and maybe that's what Makes it super popular but also causes its downfall because girl dinner
[00:03:34.700] Also blew up it was like everywhere for me like two weeks three weeks and then suddenly I feel like I haven't heard that phrase In months, that's true. It did crash and burn You just had to be there Dang and girl dinner was a good one
[00:03:51.180] I'm sad to sound go I guess that would kind of evolved to like girl math or now It's like a slightly different format, but you know, it's not really referenced anymore. Yeah. Okay. What about the category of
[00:04:05.980] So good, it became classic like now it's just like a part of our daily vocabulary or we still stand around often I think this one has to be the left no crumbs slash eight
[00:04:17.300] I think left no crumbs is actually not used as much. It's more just like they ate right? Yeah that one I feel like Gradually grew more and more in popularity
[00:04:28.740] I think eight as we discussed earlier. It has taken over a bunch of these words that aren't really used anymore So we were saying earlier like understood the assignment you can replace that with eight another one I'm thinking of is like sleigh. Oh, yeah totally replaced by eight
[00:04:48.380] Dude okay that one. I actually still can't stop saying I'm in like sleigh rehab Okay, dead ass I think it's also a classic to me this is almost not even slang it's like a real word
[00:05:06.260] That's how much I use it. It's also been around for a long last time. That's true Yeah, like we can't we can't truly say it was just Gen Z
[00:05:15.020] I think it's like, you know a little bit of millennial in there and I think it's not too affected by time If you were to say sleigh now, maybe people would be like, oh that's like outdated
[00:05:27.180] But if you were to say dead ass, I think no one would straight-up say like that word is outdated Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, maybe cuz it never hit. Well, I don't know I feel like at the peak of dead ass popularity
[00:05:39.300] It definitely was an overused word because I was gonna say that's what pushes a word into like cringe territory almost which Causes its downfall is when it's like overused I like dead ass at its peak was overused but it still somehow cemented itself into like regular vocabulary word
[00:05:56.900] Agreed. Oh my god, speaking of like sleigh and dead ass. You said that you can't stop saying sleigh still So besides sleigh, is there any other ones that it's like I just can't stop using this language Someone saved me from the word sleigh Okay, mewing
[00:06:19.740] Hmm and in its category like looks maxing and mogging I know this is a word that came around more recently, but I feel like I still am using this one pretty constantly That's fair. It kind of tows the line between like cringe
[00:06:36.340] It's like a very I'm online 24-7 kind of a word, but I feel like if you're self-aware about it, it's like so funny Yeah, it's definitely one of those people are using it ironically so much that it's an ironic I think one that I use a lot is
[00:06:56.940] Molding is one. I think that one still continues to be funny And I think I also use a lock-in. Oh true Yeah I think as lock-ins very applicable and I think it's also good for if you're like with a bunch of people and maybe you're playing
[00:07:12.780] Like party games or something. You're like, hold up. Let me like lock in I Think even last night we were like hanging out with a bunch of people playing some sort of stupid video game and
[00:07:25.780] After a certain point of losing everyone leans forward with like the controller in hand and we're all like, okay lock it All right, so I already know what word is gonna be in this category But this next category is called killed by Millennials
[00:07:45.900] Dude slays in a lot of these categories It's hurting my feelings for real Okay, I think also though what could fall into this is like itch Bowl Because that was potentially a trap set for Millennials. Anyway, oh my god era And it's giving
[00:08:06.860] Both I think fall into this category of killed by Millennials Oh, I can totally see that cuz it's giving is like it's not really used anymore. Yeah. Well, I still use it But unfortunately, I'm a millennial
[00:08:21.380] Or I guess what I mean is I don't see it as much on like tick-tock and stuff now Maybe I hear it more in real life now. Oh, that's true. So it's like that transition from like young
[00:08:33.780] Online people to like in real life people who are similar to myself I mean, I feel like it's giving an era and Slay maybe live in this category because it's like the gateway drug of slaying
[00:08:49.500] It's way easier to make a it's giving joke or like an era joke than to make a looks maxing joke Or like a giga chat joke
[00:08:58.300] Yeah, and these were like easier to understand yeah, it was like oh we can catch on to this like the slayings not getting too crazy yet Yeah, and it's like business casual like work professional. You can make a slay joke at work. But if you were like, yeah
[00:09:16.580] You would not it would not be looked upon well, you'd get some weird looks Okay, I have a funny one for this category the millennial pause So I think this still exists for sure and people still call it out sometimes but
[00:09:33.420] Because Millennials hated getting called out on it so much They like practiced so that way less people do the millennial pause now in their videos I also wonder because the millennial pause we talked about it maybe last year or so
[00:09:48.060] But the whole like making fun of millennial thing was big during kovat and like a couple years before that But now Gen alpha which is the generation after Gen Z or at that age where they're like chronically online posting stuff on tik-tok
[00:10:02.980] They're the ones kind of shaping and forming slaying true. So then now I feel like Gen Z doesn't hold the power Oh, I see. So like Gen Alpha doesn't care about the millennial pause Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they're probably shitting on Gen Z now
[00:10:16.940] Wait, that's true. They're probably like what fuck is Gen Z saying? Okay, I always forget that actually a lot of Gen Z people are Graduated from college. They're like working now. Yeah, they're like not that far from us
[00:10:30.540] Gen alpha is like the kids that are in high school and and stuff, right? Yeah, I think they're probably like teenagers or something like that. They're the ones leading the scabby Revolution oh my god, their slang is truly edging on gibberish
[00:10:47.340] Okay, well that brings us to slang that has evolved beyond comprehension Okay, I think for this one my mind goes to yeah, I was kind of thinking that too Right because this one was first introduced to us with some sort of meaning about like someone's but basically
[00:11:07.460] And I feel like that's fairly straightforward But sometimes on videos on tik-tok I see like young kids using the term Young kids using the term and I'm like, okay. I thought I knew what this meant
[00:11:19.460] But now the way you're using this I don't know if I really know what this means anymore agreed agreed It's sometimes I'm like wait, did I misunderstand? And I think it's also interesting cuz like Riz Was kind of like a slang word that's adjacent to Gyaat
[00:11:36.660] Mm-hmm if slang words could have categories like these two would fall in the same category Do you know what I mean? Yeah Yeah But I think Riz has kind of died down a bit but Gyaat's only gotten more and more powerful so like in a way
[00:11:55.300] Gyaat has like overtaken Riz and in some context is almost like interchangeable with it And so I mean, I don't even know because as you said this slang word has evolved beyond comprehension dude, I think Gyaat and
[00:12:11.500] Riz and a couple other slang words that we like mentioned in this conversation. So like Skibbity, for example and also like Ohio and like nervous shit, you know, like all the words that go into those kind of like parody slang songs
[00:12:26.740] Mm-hmm. I feel like live in its own universe and The way kids use them nowadays it truly confounds me I'm like, are they just trying to be ironic and be like, oh look at all this crazy slang
[00:12:39.780] Like you adults won't ever be able to figure it out or whatever Or does it truly mean something in their like vocabulary because the sentences that they come up with I'm like what the fuck
[00:12:52.100] Dude I don't know because back in the day like our slang made sense to us So I have a feeling that like their slang probably makes sense to them. Yeah sadly I feel like our most complex slang back then was like YOLO Wait, you're absolutely right
[00:13:18.400] Wow, yeah, I'm trying to think if we ever had any complicated slang. Oh my god I maybe our most complicated one was ruffle a mouth or like ruffle copter, you know Yeah Okay, actually to be fair
[00:13:33.520] Ruffle copter does it that is actually kind of gibberish true. Only the first half is like real The copter part was totally gibberish Although we had like lit but I guess like honestly that's not confusing once you get it. It's like, okay something is like Exciting
[00:13:56.640] Right, and it's like it's like a word that's universal almost. Yeah, it's like a real word actually That's true, too But I will admit lit might be confusing because of its multiple definitions. Oh
[00:14:09.720] There's multiple definitions. Yeah, because lit can mean like, you know, something's very exciting like this party's lit, right? But you could also be like I'm lit and that means like I'm drunk Oh true and in like gaming context
[00:14:24.800] You could say like I'm lit and that means you're like low health. You're like damaged What did not even know this last one? That's true. Maybe so that's like cooked because we talked about how
[00:14:37.400] Cooked and let him cook like all of these things kind of mean slightly different meanings. So I can totally see that Yeah All I'm saying is I feel like our slang back in the day is googleable
[00:14:50.680] It's like you hear it once you might be like what and then you google it and you're like, oh I see What's up, like yeah and scabby I feel like I've googled for like 20 minutes out of time and I'm like, I still don't know what this means
[00:15:00.200] Like we're reading essays on them. I Think another one that's like evolved beyond comprehension Actually, I have two for this one one is Sigma but as we discussed when we first discussed it It was already beyond our comprehension
[00:15:17.160] Not much to add on there, but I think look smacks sing and mewing has evolved Maybe not beyond comprehension straight up But it's definitely evolved because when we first discussed to mewing it was literally an act right like it was like an action
[00:15:35.200] But now mewing just means like good-looking or something Or like trying to be good-looking, yeah Yeah, so I'm like, oh so the definition legitimately like changed a bit there It is no longer the action that it originated from it is like a descriptor word almost
[00:15:53.360] And I feel like the tapping of the jaw and like the lining of it Oh, you know up even further than when we had first discussed it
[00:16:00.280] Mm-hmm in the beginning that was kind of just like the chart or like the graphic that came with like the term mewing So then sometimes people would pop that in to the meme format
[00:16:09.240] But now I feel like in videos like, you know how our generation when someone points a camera on us We like do a peace sign or something Like the kids nowadays they like tap their jaw. They do Whoa
[00:16:22.880] Also looks maxing which is pretty adjacent to like mewing. I've seen it evolve because I sent you like a Tick-tock earlier today and I also saw another like caption instead of looks maxing it was like
[00:16:37.560] Blank maxing one of the captions. I saw was like a word Guinness maxing out here in Dublin And then the one that I sent you it was like some animation of someone spraying a cockroach
[00:16:50.440] With perfume by accident instead of like roach killer and then the caption was like roach maxing Okay, that one is easy to follow yeah, but I love seeing the evolution of this
[00:17:06.880] I think like the double X's in the maxing part just makes it so much funnier. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's true That's key. Like it was just maxing with with 1x then it's not the slaying one. No It doesn't make as much sense
[00:17:21.520] Roach maxing with 1x like what does that even mean? Like who's laughing not me? But 2x is I'm doubled over All right, how about words that are too niche
[00:17:35.320] Like maybe we discussed it and like never popped off or it just like stayed very niche. Okay, I feel like this one Mm-hmm. I'm thinking of the word medium And maybe it's because I wasn't in like the right audience for this word
[00:17:48.680] But I don't think I've still seen this word out in the wild. Mm-hmm. So maybe it was Something that I'm not like the intended audience for or it was like a more niche word Mm-hmm. Actually, I agree. I think I haven't really seen this either
[00:18:04.520] but I imagine maybe this word still floats around in like People who are really into fitness me because yeah just as a refresher for our listeners This word is supposed to mean like you wear a size smaller
[00:18:18.800] So instead of like if you're normally a medium you wear a small so that you look bigger more buff or whatever But yeah, I think I generally don't see this word at all in the content that I come across
[00:18:30.840] Okay, the other one that I am thinking of is for free Mm-hmm. So this one I do see but I feel like it's always only about someone's like feet This is very niche
[00:18:42.720] It's like I only ever see it on IG stories or like tick-tock where someone posts a photo and they're like toes are showing in The corner or something and the thing is always like oh for free Yeah, but that's only the context that is ever used
[00:18:56.200] Yeah, I think that's the most common I see this as well but I have seen like kind of an evolved version of this which is sometimes on tik-tok if I like Come across a really high quality video or maybe it's just like really funny
[00:19:11.680] Sometimes the comments are like I can't believe tik-tok is free Oh, I have seen that or sometimes it's like oh shoot my bad. I didn't know I was on tik-tok premium I
[00:19:24.040] Love that. Yeah, so I feel like that has been the evolved form of this but even that is like kind of niche It's like only on specific for example, just really high quality videos
[00:19:35.160] That's also just such a funny way of being like I like this video. Yeah, this is tik-tok premium Okay, what about the category? Makes me cringe Cringe I Okay, I do think the gritty makes me cringe a bit but only because I
[00:20:00.520] Personally would never be able to do the gritty But I'm not cringing when other people are doing it I'm just yeah, I'm doing if I'm imagining myself being forced to do it Mmm, I feel like period Period
[00:20:14.800] Makes me cringe a little bit, but it's also just not used as much anymore That's so then maybe that's the cringe aspect like the people who still use Some of these words that are phased out or maybe people who don't keep up with like the latest slang
[00:20:27.520] so then it's like That's where the cringe comes to like we're moved on. Yeah, we're on this new shit You're like you didn't get the latest edition of slang magazine But I'm still saying slay so Oh Okay, I think pookie is also kind of a cringe one
[00:20:46.760] But I think it's like inherently supposed to be cringe worthy right and because of that it's funny So I think that one is a little bit dude Imagine me saying pookie to someone
[00:20:59.600] Dude, but that's like the beauty of the word. You know what? I mean? Like you own the cringe But that doesn't stop me from cringing Yeah, I mean I feel like cringe is sometimes just unexplainable like to me the word valid is very cringe
[00:21:17.200] Because I feel like it's kind of I don't know we both know you mean like, okay Or like that's fair or something. Like why do we have to say valid?
[00:21:24.440] It seems so unnatural to me, which is what makes it cringe, but I know it's like a legitimate use of the word You've always had a gripe with valid Wait, did I say something like that on the episode we talked about it?
[00:21:38.280] Or one of the episodes it got brought up and you're like, yeah, I don't love this one, but whatever Hey, at least I'm consistent. That's true Okay, how about slang words that are like still alive but barely breathing? Oh, okay Loki I fear
[00:21:58.080] Even though I know it just came up. I feel like it's already on its way out. Yeah a little bit I still see it around for sure, but its usage is Exponentially lower than when it first popped off for that like week or two
[00:22:12.680] It's another one of those quick rise, but even quicker fall And this one hurts a little bit but is blank in the room with us right now I love this format and I think it's so funny
[00:22:25.640] But I do think it's on its way out slash out already. Maybe maybe I still see it So, I don't know like if it's just becoming more niche maybe or if it is like kind of on its way out
[00:22:39.240] But yeah, it's still so funny when I see it. I Think ik is actually kind of still alive but barely breathing. Oh, yeah Yeah, it had its moment and it was pretty long too But I think nowadays I don't know
[00:22:55.800] Maybe it's just like the content has moved on from like picking at people's icks I did see some like anti ik discourse that came out after the whole like Oh name everyone's icks kind of thing that was talking about how once you like focus on all these minute
[00:23:12.520] Things that you don't like about someone that becomes the focus of what you notice about people So then is it even that helpful or productive? I mean granted it's supposed to be like funny and all and it is like acknowledged to be petty
[00:23:26.080] But is it productive like is it constructive to like focus on people's eggs? Yeah valid But yeah, that makes sense It's probably tiring to constantly pick out the tiny things and I feel like on that one
[00:23:44.440] People can be savage like the icks that people were saying in the beginning. I felt like we're very fair like oh, yes Treats wait staff rudely and at the end it was like stuff. That's very normal about people Oh my god, like uncontrollable about people
[00:23:58.120] There was a funny one that was like, oh my god, it's an ick when people wear no-show socks. I Saw one that was like it's such an ick when a guy orders like a vanilla bean Frappuccino Oh my god, and then the comments were like, okay
[00:24:14.560] Like let the men enjoy their vanilla bean Let them be their baby girl selves Exactly Do you have any slang words that are like you're scared to use this in person? Okay, kind of but I feel like it's for good reason. So BFFR be fucking fo real and
[00:24:37.520] Tweaking I think our words that are still very much alive and like in use but to me they just feel like slightly aggressive So it's not words that I feel like super comfortable using in person, yeah, I would say pookie again
[00:24:57.360] I think pookie to you is valid to me But I love seeing it I love But like me using it, you know questionable. Oh Okay, actually also yacht. I feel like I'm too old to be using words like that
[00:25:15.600] No the times that you have said it in person. I've always died laughing like that shit is so It's more funny when it comes from someone so unassuming. Oh My god that reminds me of like so I don't say the word bitch a lot
[00:25:30.840] But sometimes when I say it you like you're always like, oh my god Dude it hits so good I'll have to maintain that power by continuing to use it very very limited
[00:25:48.920] Well, this is like supply and demand 101. Yeah, the demand is so high because the supply is so at the front Everyone is thirsting for me to say Everyone's just waiting in anticipation for me to say pookie While doing the gritty I I
[00:26:10.560] Think also though mewing looks maxing mogging. I'm like low-key scared to say it in case I say it wrong. Oh Actually, that's a really good point because there's such good words very powerful Potent words, but I feel like if you use it wrong, it goes into cringe category
[00:26:28.240] Then you have to like use it correctly Yeah, I feel that one also Sigma cuz this one as we said beyond our comprehension, so I wouldn't dare use All right last category that we have today What is a word that you wish was still popular and use?
[00:26:46.680] Okay, this is the I miss you category. Well, I know what yours is The four-letter word, okay, but can I miss it when I use it like 20 times a day? You will single-handedly bring it back into fashion Yes, I will never let go of slay
[00:27:08.880] Bury me with the word slay. I Kind of liked POV Mmm, I felt like those were always quick to understand and like an easy setup for a joke Mmm, although so I still see POV
[00:27:23.800] But I feel like it's one of those words that was overtaken by like the corporate world So I feel like every time I see a video with like POV. It's an ad
[00:27:33.960] It's like Oh POV you forget to clean your house and then it's like yeah all the cleaning supplies or something I'm like, what the fuck? Yeah, I can totally see how that killed the word Killed by capitalism sad. I also miss girl dinner to be honest
[00:27:51.520] Mmm, such an easy one to use be like, oh my god today like I don't feel like cooking. Let's do girl dinner I I miss that one. I feel like the sound was just very iconic with that one too Satisfying. Mm-hmm, dude. I feel like weirdly
[00:28:07.480] nostalgic after doing these Maybe because we see so many of these words online or had seen a lot of this stuff online Not certain periods of time. It does kind of feel like blast from the past a little bit
[00:28:21.000] Yeah, some of these are truly like gone and we're looking over them We're like wow, like that was just a year ago. Yeah, like bombastic side. I was crazy. Yeah and
[00:28:33.580] That one holds a special place in my heart because I first learned about it through like some random in a game And they said it they kept saying it to like me and my duo like plastic side eye and we were like what is going on? Me
[00:28:49.580] That's like the scariest way to learn slang just like in the wild dude. We literally asked that guy to we're like What does it mean? And he was like, I don't know just means bombastic side Okay Thanks for clearing that up
[00:29:08.140] Well, hopefully this was as fun for everyone else to listen to as it was for us We'll continue to roll out that slang segment of our podcast so stay tuned for more educational like this in the future, but
[00:29:22.260] Before we wrap up today's episode. We also did want to do a little bit of a life update segment as well We kind of think of this as our like crises like so it's like what's the latest?
[00:29:33.740] Crisis that you have been going through dude. I've definitely been going through a crisis and it's I Think it's like the culmination of just like life and then now I'm at a point where I'm like wait I can't believe I've been doing life like this for
[00:29:49.380] 20 plus years almost 30 years. I'm having a procrastination crisis To describe it like imagine you're just holding a rope and you know Like you can hold it with no tension or with a lot of tension
[00:30:04.100] And I feel like what happens is like days leading up to a due date or something, you know I'm basically holding this rope. Like my hands are so close together. There's like absolutely no tension and then it's like the day or two days before the deadline and
[00:30:20.860] I'm like I pulled this rope like as far apart as I can There's just maximum tension and I'm like, oh my god, I need to like get this done And I'm like I need to regulate this more. I think it's not
[00:30:34.060] Productive or healthy to like be constantly going back and forth into these like two extremes Whoa, dude, that visual is crazy. I'm like imagining you with a resistance band or something. Oh my god and I think like one of the
[00:30:48.900] interesting things about this problem is like I'm trying to figure out if it's because I'm too Overwhelmed or if I'm too underwhelmed because you know how it's like if you have some like stress That's good because that'll get you up and like doing things
[00:31:04.700] But if you don't have enough stress, then that will actually lead to not doing things But then if you have like too much stress, then you become like overwhelmed and you also can't do things So I'm like, oh shoot like am I overwhelmed or am I underwhelmed?
[00:31:18.260] Something needs to change so that I can find a more regular pace, I guess God, I like totally feel that I think even with social plans and stuff, too It's like the weekends where I have back-to-back-to-back plans. I'm so overwhelmed
[00:31:34.020] I'm like, I don't know why I ever stacked my weekend like this. This is insane So then the next weekend all like shuffle stuff around so I have at least like one or two free days
[00:31:43.180] Then I feel like on those actual free days. I'm like craving to do something I'm like, oh my god, like maybe I should hit up this person and we'll go out to get lunch or whatever
[00:31:50.580] I should have been making more out of this day. So I feel like it is like a constant Do I need more or do I need less? Yeah, so that's been like kind of my big crisis lately
[00:32:01.900] I think I'm still kind of adjusting and settling down since I moved recently So I'm still kind of finding my like routine and what works and what doesn't work. Yeah, we'll see Hopefully hopefully something will get solved Yeah, I mean maybe it's like a calibration thing
[00:32:22.740] You know, you're like recalibrating your whole life to make sense in this new way of life And especially with like a new environment and everything and I'm sure you had your whole list of to-dos like for moving specifically, too
[00:32:35.500] Yeah, I can see how it can be a total balancing act. Yeah for sure I think like now that I'm mostly settled there's less of the new home things like Find a bed a mattress Get plates so you can eat and stuff like that
[00:32:54.220] Now it's more like okay. What days should I be going to work? What days should I work from home What days should be the errand day and what day should be like laundry day? So I think we're getting there but in the meantime, I'll be struggling
[00:33:10.260] Well, I feel you on that. I feel like my whole life I'm always on some sort of procrastination crisis or another so We shall get through it together Although I do have this like weird hope for myself. Maybe that like maybe once I'm a parent
[00:33:24.780] I'll procrastinate less because it's one thing to procrastinate on your own things Yeah, but I feel like in shared projects or like responsibilities that I have that might affect my husband For example, I've procrastinate a little bit less and then with a kid
[00:33:39.700] Maybe it'll be even better. Like maybe I don't know more responsibility on your shoulder. Yeah, you're like, oh shoot If I don't do this thing my child might like not be okay. Yeah Well, I don't know
[00:33:52.300] Maybe it's like also when you're a pet owner like you have to step up and like be like a good owner true I completely agree when it's just you it's like oh well the only person who will receive these consequences are myself anyway
[00:34:06.500] Yeah, I'm like, it's just me I can do well. How about you? What has your latest crisis been lately? I've been in this crisis where I think a common theme in my life is I like have these feelings and I like have something to say and
[00:34:22.860] Then I like don't say it like I just suppress it inside Things like that I think are especially more common for me and like customer service settings You know when you like order boba and the wrong thing comes out
[00:34:34.940] I'm like do I really need it return the drink and like get the correct one back, etc Mm-hmm, so that has been my whole life But recently I'm like, you know what maybe I just need to go full Karen and turn my Karen era
[00:34:47.420] Put my foot down because two weeks ago I was trying to like order these glasses online a pair for myself and a pair for my husband and We go to this like optometrist office, right? I had sent them an email and was like hey
[00:35:01.160] Can you guys send over like our prescriptions because like two months prior we had gone in to get our eye test and we only got A copy of our contact lens prescriptions. So I was like, oh, hey
[00:35:10.280] Can you guys email me our glasses prescriptions and then radio silence? I was like, oh, it's fine Maybe they don't check their inbox. So I call them and ask them for it and there she's like, okay
[00:35:21.380] Like I'll send it to you by end of day. I'm like, oh my god. Thanks so much. Hang up. Nothing comes in I wait like a couple days maybe like three four business days. That's still nothing, right?
[00:35:30.880] So I call again and she's like, oh like yeah, I'll send it by end of day. I'm like, okay Thanks so much. Hang up. Nothing comes in again. So I call for the third time
[00:35:40.280] This is like one email and three phone calls and this time I'm like, you know I could just do the same thing that I did every time and pretend that it's my first time calling
[00:35:49.160] I'd be like, oh like do you mind shooting over the prescription by email and be like nice But I was like, this is a little crazy Like yeah I should say something and I was like hey
[00:35:57.720] Do you think you can help me get a copy of my prescription because I've called a couple times and I've emailed as well But I've just never been able to get any luck getting my prescription in the mail
[00:36:06.600] I'm just like oh so sorry about that. Like I'll send it over right now in like 20 minutes So then I finally got it and I was like, okay My new outlook on life is to be a polite Karen, you know
[00:36:17.360] like I don't have to just pretend like nothing has happened to me and Suppress these feelings like I could just politely address the situation and be like hey Can you guys just send this to me ASAP? Like I actually need it
[00:36:29.480] So I am unlocking a new chapter in my life where I actually do say something about these things. Ooh, I like that That's probably better for your mental too. Yeah when you were sharing your story
[00:36:42.160] It was kind of reminding me of that saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me I was like, oh my god, you're about to get fooled the second time
[00:36:52.560] Yeah, dude and I think it was like normally this wouldn't stress me out that much But I had also ordered these like blackout blinds for our bedroom to get better sleep for me and my husband Those blinds also came in like non blackout version
[00:37:08.260] So then I was like trying to get this corrected through Customer service with the blinds company who was also being unresponsive and I also had to follow up with them three to four times To even get a replacement
[00:37:19.400] So I was like, I need my prescription and I need my blackout blinds and no one wants to give me anything And it was like driving me crazy So I think that's what drove me to unlock this new Karen era of my life
[00:37:32.600] actually, I was kind of talking about something related to this with a friend and We talked about how like it's okay to be inconvenient Because then you're like truly Expressing your needs Versus like I guess we're so used to being like, oh if it's not doing much trouble
[00:37:52.800] Can you do this or you know, blah blah blah like we're so used to trying to be more convenient, right? So then I was like damn, I guess that's true Like we should express ourselves more and that's like assertive communication or whatever you want to call it
[00:38:08.560] yeah, I feel like that's such a helpful thing to note too because I'm very conscious of my Identity I guess as an Asian American woman, especially a Korean American woman
[00:38:19.040] and I feel like there's all these values that have been instilled in me as a young girl and now that I'm Older I need to unlearn some of these things, you know where I'm always like
[00:38:29.920] Oh, I should be polite at my own expense basically like politeness is one thing But I feel like it shouldn't come like a certain level of self-sacrifice. You know, I am equally a Patient I'm equally a client a paying customer
[00:38:44.680] Just as much as other people are and I don't know why I would have to like forgo certain rights in order to be like the most polite Angel customer or something, you know what I mean?
[00:38:55.760] It's just like why am I doing this to myself like at the very basic? I should get some level of service or whatever, you know I'm just trying to listen to my feelings and not just like shove them down
[00:39:06.160] Prioritize my needs and stuff above all these like social rules that like a web of like social rules that I've entrapped myself in Basically is how I feel sometimes. Yeah, I totally feel that
[00:39:16.840] I think I'm similar to you that like usually if something's slightly wrong, I'm just like, okay. Well, I guess that's life Just fucking take it and I'll eat the wrong order or whatever, right?
[00:39:28.920] But then yeah, like sometimes it does hit the point where you're like, oh my god Like maybe I should say something about this Okay, actually I have a funny story about this Uh-huh. I fucking had a credit card where my name was spelled wrong
[00:39:42.360] I think I had spelled it wrong in my initial application maybe where it was something like Crystal with the a and L swapped so it's like crystal ah Chris law And I just kept using that card for I think like almost a full year
[00:39:59.120] And then I was like, okay, actually I should probably get this Changed way of four years crazy Yeah, and I was like I can't believe I've just been letting myself use this incorrect name for like a full year
[00:40:12.480] But I finally called them and it was actually so easy to change too and I was like Why didn't I do this sooner? Like what is wrong with me? Oh Man, I totally feel that though. That is definitely something I would do
[00:40:23.960] I'm like, is this really that bad and then time passes and I'm like, why did I not get this fixed earlier? Yeah, but I think what really matters is that you're gonna be a polite Karen it's not someone who's I guess like being rude or
[00:40:38.560] Disruptive. I think it's like all well within your rights. Yeah true. I'm unlocking like well, basically I'm trying to get to my normal like level that everyone else is at but to me that's like the Karen level
[00:40:51.380] So it's my Karen era, but maybe I'm just learning to be normal for the first time in my life I feel that I feel that we should all embrace some of our inner Karen She deserves love too. Yeah Well, this was a fun episode
[00:41:07.560] I think it was pretty fun to like look through a Lot of the slang words that we've talked about before and also always fun to catch up on each other's crises I feel like usually the crisis that I'm going through and the one that you're going through is
[00:41:23.640] Very relatable, but it's just like at the moment your crisis and not mine And then maybe next time it's like it'll be my crisis, but not yours Very true So for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts on favorite slang words or similar crises as us
