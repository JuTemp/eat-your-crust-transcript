[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal.
[00:00:07.000]  Alright so we're going to switch things up a little bit and I will intro the Gen Z word slash sling word of the week.
[00:00:23.000]  This is something that I found on TikTok in the comments actually where I just saw the comments of this one video.
[00:00:30.000]  It was all this one phrase for the phrase today is lock in so the meaning of this word I think is somewhat easy to figure out it basically means you get into the zone,
[00:00:43.000]  you kind of pull it together, you concentrate a little bit and you really lock in but the Know Your Mean page has some of the funniest memes I've ever seen.
[00:00:52.000]  So one of them is when the face ID fucking up and I got a lock in and it has three emojis to which are crying emojis and the third one is just like a really sculptured defined face emoji which is so funny.
[00:01:05.000]  It's like I definitely have been there. The other one is when you're drunk as fuck in a 7-11 and you got to lock in to talk to the cashier.
[00:01:14.000]  Like both memes are actually you just instantly know what lock in means.
[00:01:18.000]  I was surprised that this is like such a popular phrase now because you said you've been seeing it all over TikTok comments,
[00:01:25.000]  just like lock in, lock in because I kind of know it from gaming not even necessarily as a slang phrase but now that I think about it the nature of it is kind of slain.
[00:01:39.000]  But whenever you're playing a game and you're losing and it's a team game it's very common to hear like all right everyone like lock in,
[00:01:46.000]  you know we're gonna turn this around, we're gonna start winning or maybe you're playing against someone they're like are I gotta like sit up now and like lock in play properly against you now.
[00:01:56.000]  So that's kind of how I have heard it use in the past but I think the memes and the comments are really funny in all these real world situations.
[00:02:06.000]  It's so relatable.
[00:02:08.000]  Yeah, and I feel like what's also hilarious is I think you're right like this phrase specifically can be attributed to so many different situations.
[00:02:17.000]  You're slacking a little bit and then suddenly you have to like really focus and put it together but the way the meme format is it's like I'm looking at one meme here on No Your Meme.
[00:02:26.000]  A picture of Mario looking goofy as hell.
[00:02:28.000]  And the next picture is literally Mario like staring into the I guess camera like the photo looking really stashed.
[00:02:35.000]  I don't want this is so iconic.
[00:02:38.000]  So funny.
[00:02:39.000]  What are examples of TikToks that you've seen the comments for?
[00:02:43.000]  So I think you're right, I'm scrolling through TikTok and I see a bunch of like gamer ones but I see this one that's super funny.
[00:02:50.000]  It says POV, you're having a breakdown in your room and you start hearing footsteps so you have to lock it.
[00:02:55.000]  Oh my god.
[00:02:56.000]  That's just so like this is the most relatable phrase I've ever heard in my entire life.
[00:03:00.000]  Yeah.
[00:03:01.000]  There's so many moments where I'm like okay got to lock it.
[00:03:03.000]  Yeah.
[00:03:04.000]  Oh my god, that's so funny.
[00:03:05.000]  I can think of one like I feel like a lot of people can relate to this back in the day and in school when your parents aren't home from work yet and you're slacking but then you hear the garage door open.
[00:03:16.000]  Oh my god.
[00:03:17.000]  Yeah. And your mom was like oh can you make the right or like can you defrost as you're like fuck?
[00:03:22.000]  You got to lock it.
[00:03:24.000]  And I feel like also back in high school when I told my mom I couldn't do something because I had to study and then I was just goofing off in my room and I hear footsteps.
[00:03:31.000]  Got to lock it.
[00:03:32.000]  Yeah.
[00:03:33.000]  What a great phrase.
[00:03:34.000]  I like that this is becoming popular.
[00:03:36.000]  Oh yeah, I'm a big fan.
[00:03:38.000]  I think we should incorporate into our daily vocabulary.
[00:03:41.000]  Agreed.
[00:03:42.000]  It's so fun to use outside of the gaming context.
[00:03:45.000]  Well I definitely know I'm going to be spending all my time flipping through lock in tic-tocs later but back to the podcast topic at hand today.
[00:03:55.000]  Today we wanted to really talk a little bit about the generational gap.
[00:04:00.000]  This one is specifically dedicated to our parents where we wanted to dive in a little bit about the differences and I guess attitude and sort of outlook on life or different aspects of life that we've been experiencing in terms of us versus our parents and how dealing with that has evolved over the years.
[00:04:17.000]  I feel like almost all aspects of life there's potential conflicting viewpoints just because our backgrounds are so different.
[00:04:27.000]  Things as basic as like friendships and then as complicated as like finances and career paths.
[00:04:33.000]  One example I can actually think of for friendships is and I think we might have mentioned this on the podcast before just as a random comment but I remember specifically when I was growing up my parents would say oh your high school friends aren't necessarily going to be your lifelong friends.
[00:04:51.000]  You know when they said that I guess I didn't know how to react because I didn't know for sure.
[00:04:57.000]  I was like I guess there's some like possibility to these words that they're saying but also like I don't know if that's going to be true for me either and then as we've grown older very interestingly at least for us and a lot of people just in the Bay Area in general.
[00:05:11.000]  We still continue to uphold our high school connections to a decent degree and just thinking about it why did my parents say that back in the day it makes so much sense because they literally left their home country and came to a new country across the world.
[00:05:28.000]  So of course you know they're not going to be as close with their high school friends as we would be because we're still in the same country that we've been growing up in for the most part of our lives.
[00:05:42.000]  Yeah I feel like that angle makes discussing friendships so interesting and like different with our parents.
[00:05:49.000]  I think what I feel too is like I wonder how much social media has changed the friendship landscape sort of.
[00:05:58.000]  I know back in our parents age I think by the time they were in their late 20s early 30s email was probably starting to gain traction so at least they had something that wasn't just phone calls and snail mail but it's like there's nothing so convenient like social media where you can keep up with people without having to actually keep up with them.
[00:06:17.000]  I know what's going on in people's lives without having like personally contacted them in a long time I still makes me feel connected to them.
[00:06:26.000]  So then I feel like I have a much more maybe like a lighter view on friendship than my parents who they needed like that international commitment to upkeep their friendships.
[00:06:37.000]  That's such a good point you explaining that is totally making me realize how much I take for granted our connectivity.
[00:06:45.000]  I'm just imagining that we could only communicate by snail mail or phones maybe like landlines.
[00:06:53.000]  I'm sure international calls are just crazy expensive snail mail like what if someone moves then your mail gets bounced back to you like you don't know if it'll reach them if they don't update with the post office and all of that kind of stuff and it'll take so much time for it to bounce back to like what if they moved again.
[00:07:13.000]  It's just like so complicated and you know it's crazy also that reminds me my mom and dad shared a story with me before that do you remember those chain mails that we would get.
[00:07:23.000]  Yeah, like send this on to X amount of people or else you'll have bad luck for the rest of your life or whatever our parents got that except snail mail version.
[00:07:31.000]  Do so that to hand right copies. Oh my god wild that's labor. Oh my god it really is like I hope they only had to send it out to five people imagine 20 yeah maybe they kept it back then now Jen alpha probably gets those and it's like sent to a thousand of your best friends.
[00:07:50.000]  I feel like it was also crazy to me is sometimes I think about this when I watched older sort of like retro vibe dramas. I feel like people were maybe a little bit less private back then because my mom told me some story about how this person from our high school really wanted to get in touch with her but my mom had already moved away to like soul.
[00:08:09.000]  So no then that person visited my mom's childhood home and like knocked on the door and spoke to my mom's mom's on my grandma. And I was like, oh where's you know my insert mom's name here like I want to talk to her can I get her contact information because I guess it makes sense right like you couldn't really Google someone back then.
[00:08:29.000]  Right but now I'm just like dude if someone from my high school came to my mom's house and like knocked on the door and asked for my contact info.
[00:08:37.000]  I would be so creeped out like that would be a huge invasion of privacy.
[00:08:42.000]  I yeah I feel like my parents would be like who are you like are you a serial killer what is this new tactic.
[00:08:50.000]  Honestly even now when someone knocks on our front door I always check via ring to like see who it is but I think back then it was kind of normal to get knocks on the door and like open the door and talk to people.
[00:09:01.000]  Yeah agreed I mean even for me I remember before the age of pretty much eight.
[00:09:11.000]  We would just open the door if someone knocked on the like ring or double maybe it was my neighbor and you know it was a lot more like spontaneous like I don't know
[00:09:21.000]  someone is going to come knock on the door to ask to like hang out or go play on the streets or whatever but now it's like hey I'm going to come to your house at five p.m.
[00:09:30.000]  And then sometimes we're just like okay like don't even ring the doorbell just text me when you're here.
[00:09:35.000]  I think there's many layers of communication before people come but truly back then it was like kids would bike over and like knock and be like oh can you see a play.
[00:09:42.000]  I just like can't imagine that anymore.
[00:09:45.000]  Absolutely not.
[00:09:47.000]  We're all like cowering in fear when the doorbell rings pull out our phones check the camera like could it be.
[00:09:54.000]  I guess a little bit different from friendships but still kind of similar is relationships.
[00:10:00.000]  I remember having a lot of conversations with my parents about relationships and I think the attitudes that they held about dating at a younger age were not too different from mine.
[00:10:11.000]  I was kind of like okay date a bunch of people to see what is the best fit and move forward from there.
[00:10:17.000]  But I do feel like my parents have a very specific idea about marriage.
[00:10:22.000]  They were like oh if you're sure that James is the one you guys should marry the sooner or the better versus now I feel like in our generation it is a little bit more like paste out.
[00:10:32.000]  It's not like oh as soon as he's the one get married it's more like get me on your own time like I know some people have been dating for a very long time
[00:10:40.000]  and do not prioritize marriage because of logistical things.
[00:10:44.000]  And I feel like that's a huge difference from our parents generation for sure.
[00:10:48.000]  Oh so your parents actually encouraged you to date when you were younger?
[00:10:53.000]  Yeah I think like by the time I was in college they were like oh you should try to date a bunch of people and see.
[00:11:01.000]  Oh interesting.
[00:11:04.000]  I feel like my parents never had a very explicit stance on dating but it was mainly just pre-college don't date.
[00:11:14.000]  Like focus on studying.
[00:11:16.000]  But also as I think about it now comparing our generation to parents generation, it's a lot more likely you know kind of based on what we were just talking about with friendships.
[00:11:28.000]  And more likely that we can keep in contact with you know high school friends and things like that so we see a lot of like high school sweethearts.
[00:11:37.000]  And I feel like in our parents generation maybe they didn't see as many of relationships like that just because once again having immigrated out of their home country cuts off a lot of connections for a while.
[00:11:51.000]  I think that kind of plays into the whole generation gap friendships and relationships.
[00:11:57.000]  Whoa that's kind of like mind blowing actually although I feel like in Korea I have to wonder if mandatory military service has something to do with less high school sweethearts because men do have to go away for I think it's like a year and a half ish now to serve.
[00:12:15.000]  And I think that kind of can put a damper on like a new relationship of like do I really want to wait for this guy for a year and a half but interestingly on my mom's side every single couple so four of the five siblings are married to their CC.
[00:12:32.000]  So like CC is kind of like campus couple so they're all college sweethearts except my parents.
[00:12:38.000]  Actually my parents are also like a college couple but they got together much later.
[00:12:46.000]  If I'm remembering right it was either like towards the end of college or maybe like right after graduating that they got together so it's kind of late in their life that they got together but then like once they got together everything was like bam and bam like leave the country together you know have kids like all that stuff it was like things just started happening.
[00:13:06.000]  So yeah in that sense my parents were always like don't date in high school but I was like um why not.
[00:13:14.000]  I guess to be fair my parents weren't like encouraging me to date in high school but they would say off hand shit like oh it's just a high school boyfriend like just anything.
[00:13:24.000]  Yeah and then I'll be like don't be so dismissive of my lifestyle.
[00:13:31.000]  And then I think in college though my parents never really said anything about dating so there was never any pressure to date people but I guess for them maybe in their mind it was also just like oh you should probably focus on graduating and I guess if you meet someone then good for you but otherwise just focus on living and surviving and studying.
[00:13:55.000]  Dude yeah taking care of yourself is already like a huge struggle. I called it.
[00:14:00.000]  I wonder if maybe my parents were like oh date other people because I used to do this thing where I would like date one person be like he's the one until I actually found the one who is James but I feel like my parents were like why are you so serious about it?
[00:14:13.000]  Date more than like one person. I'm so clear if that's the one or not.
[00:14:17.000]  Well did your parents date more than one person so my mom I secretly told me that she has but she tells my dad she hasn't.
[00:14:27.000]  Oh my dad knows but he I think he just doesn't want to know right then my dad claims to this day that my mom was his first love but none of us believe him.
[00:14:37.000]  Dude okay my dad also said something like that and I was like are you sure wait did your parents go to like gender specific middle school high school elementary schools.
[00:14:48.000]  I don't think so so my parents grew up in the same city and they ended up going to the same university which was in the same city that they grew up in.
[00:14:57.000]  So my parents actually went to the same school since junior high but they just didn't know each other until college but they knew of each other at some point.
[00:15:08.000]  So I was always like being an annoying kid at once I knew this I was like oh my god like did you look over in junior high and think like wow that that boys gonna be my future husband and I'm almost like no what the fuck.
[00:15:23.000]  Wait that's so cute though it's like hometown lovers.
[00:15:27.000]  Yeah but they didn't become friends and then like boyfriend girlfriend until much later in their lives.
[00:15:36.000]  It's cute in concept but reality is like oh I didn't care about this person until we became friends but I do think that my parents didn't date that much before they got together.
[00:15:50.000]  Like very minimally so it's possible that they just didn't date at all seriously until they found each other and it's also possible that like maybe there was one or two but regardless I think it's very interesting because in a sense if your parents are each others just like one and only first and only I guess.
[00:16:13.000]  They might actually have less dating experience than like you.
[00:16:19.000]  Oh yeah I think theoretically if both of them were telling the truth then that would be the case right and isn't that kind of crazy to think about.
[00:16:29.000]  I guess so I mean I feel like it kind of makes sense to me though because I feel like each generation is more progressive and part of that progressiveness I feel like also bleeds into like.
[00:16:43.000]  I think that's how we see dating and stuff but I guess on the flip side I feel like dating attitudes have changed a lot at least like my Korean American attitude towards dating is very different from I think what my parents had because I think by the time my parents had gotten together my dad was going on dates kind of specifically to get married.
[00:17:03.000]  Korea they call it as fun but it's really just like okay these are two people who are hoping to get married soon so like you guys should go on a date and then they'll let people will set it up like that.
[00:17:13.000]  So then I feel like in that way he probably went on a bunch of blind dates like that but for me it's like I would want to marry someone who I love after like months and months of dating versus like trying to kind of be run it.
[00:17:27.000]  I mean it worked out well for my parents and it's I guess unfair to be like they speedrun it but I feel like the way I see it is like my dad had a priority of like getting married soon but probably by a specific age versus I don't know if I would have had that same thought I guess.
[00:17:43.000]  Yeah I think my parents probably had a similar thought like oh like we should get married soon because I think my parents got married after like a year of dating and I was like that's crazy.
[00:17:56.000]  Yeah I'm like there's no way. I think I remember because my previous relationship was relatively long and at one point my dad was like oh you guys have been dating for a while like shouldn't you get married soon and I was like dude what?
[00:18:12.000]  I'm so young like what are you talking about?
[00:18:16.000]  Right and he was like well you shouldn't wait too long regardless because and then he like goes on and on about like these ideals and I'm like I guess but also like what if I'm just not ready like I'm not at the age to marry yet.
[00:18:30.000]  And he's like sooner than later at least.
[00:18:34.000]  I am kind of curious like I wish sometimes I could time travel and see my parents when they were young because I feel like Loki there's a lot of tea and gas that they're not sharing or they'll like bread crumb it.
[00:18:44.000]  But apparently when my mom was just starting to date my dad my grandma was throwing a huge fit because my mom had allegedly said that she didn't want to get married.
[00:18:55.000]  And then my grandma was like I'm sick right now like you don't know how much longer I'll be alive spoiler alert she's literally still alive to this day.
[00:19:04.000]  I don't want to pass before I'm able to see get married like you're being a bad daughter there was a bunch of parental pressure but I guess I found it also shocking that my mom was like I don't want to get married.
[00:19:15.000]  I have this conception of like people back then they want to get married ASAP but it's like if you kind of dive into the details at least for my mom like she was sort of resistant to the idea in the first place.
[00:19:25.000]  Whoa that is very fascinating wow yeah I have no idea what my parents take is I can totally imagine a lot of people maybe even married out of convenience during our parents generation, especially if they're in a hurry to say like leave the country.
[00:19:44.000]  Right then maybe they're like oh it would be really nice if I had a supportive partner who can go through all the files and tribulations were about to face you know figure it out as we go.
[00:19:56.000]  But then for us it's all about like no I have to love them and I have to feel like perfect and like fit in my life and all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:05.000]  Right so actually when I was traveling recently I hung out with a friend who I haven't seen in a while and she was basically saying that she has kind of like an internal clock of I have to date for X number of years before I get married to someone.
[00:20:19.000]  And I found that very interesting because kind of like what I was saying I feel like there's a certain preconception I have of maybe views on marriage and stuff are still a little bit more old fashioned in Asia than it is in the US for example but for her to kind of say that I was like I'm not sure if I can get married.
[00:20:34.000]  I think that's why I think it's a very important thing to say about that is that I was like oh I guess it is kind of a real generation thing where nowadays people do have that fantasy of well in a date for however many years before getting married whereas before there was probably more of an emphasis on like you have to be married before this age.
[00:20:50.000]  I think there's also the whole thing about it being more common that people want to move in first before they get married to kind of have a little trial run there and make sure that you're able to work it out when you're living together before jumping into it right after marriage and then being like wait but then a lot of Asian American immigrant parents don't love that they're kind of like well if you're going to move in together why not just get married.
[00:21:18.000]  I mean like I don't know about you but for my parents if say like my partner is visiting our house they'll be like well you're not married so maybe you shouldn't share a bed under our roof and they're like sorry we're just a little old fashioned.
[00:21:35.000]  Dude that takes me back to when James visited my parents and stayed over for like a week it was like his first time sleeping over at our place and then my mom was like I'll prep the bed for him in the base.
[00:21:47.000]  And I was like what the fuck like we've been dating for five years already like Shirley you're okay like we literally live together at this point but a couple years prior I guess this would have been when James and I were dating for three years.
[00:22:00.000]  We did our Asia trips together so you and Avi were with us for a leg and then we eventually split off and James and I went to visit his dad and his dad booked us a hotel and when we walked in it was two twin beds.
[00:22:14.000]  Did you push them together or did you actually sleep on the separate I think we actually just slept separately honestly it was kind of nice but I was like that's hilarious yeah.
[00:22:26.000]  I mean I know a couple of my friends who have been dating for like almost ten years now up until actually still pretty recently sometimes their parents would just be like um yeah we prepped the guest room for so and so but then there was like one point that kind of thing.
[00:22:43.000]  Point that kind of changed everything and then after that was like okay I guess you can sleep in the same bed I think it was something like they were all visiting family member and that person was like oh like you two can just sleep together because we don't have room anyway.
[00:22:57.000]  And then after the parents just saw them sleeping together in the same bed things shifted after that is like okay I guess you guys can share that under our roof you did it once so like whatever yeah.
[00:23:10.000]  I feel like at least the way that I communicate with my parents sometimes or like the way I've seen my parents communicate about these things there's just so many things that are kind of vague or like left unsaid or purposely obscured and it makes me feel a little bit weird about it because I feel like in the US it's very normal to be like oh yeah we live together but even when I'm in the US when I talk to relatives for example I feel like sometimes I have to check with my parents like oh do they know we live together
[00:23:39.000]  should I not talk about it and just make sure that they're cool with it and obviously it's different now that we're married but there's been a lot of times where I'm like about to be like oh yeah we live together and then my dad or my mom cut in they're like oh you know they live like 10 minutes from each other so it's really close and I'm like what the fuck we've literally been living together for like four plus years.
[00:24:02.000]  You're like I guess his office is five minutes from the bedroom.
[00:24:07.600]  Yeah and it gets all weird because I think it was happy news when James and I bought a house and then I was kind of like oh like I'm excited to like maybe talk about it or like whatever
[00:24:16.760]  And then because they like no one can know that we live together I was like they were like oh what what have you been up to and I'm like nothing.
[00:24:24.320]  You're like still living in that apartment in your own cup of tea.
[00:24:30.480]  No dude I remember once at this dinner they were like oh how's your apartment is it nice how much do you pay and then I almost said like the actual event
[00:24:40.080]  that I was paying splitting the James and then I was like well I guess I still not really fair so like during dinner I was like how much should I scale down our
[00:24:47.400]  rent so that it makes like reasonable sense in terms of the story of me allegedly living by myself and I was like this is too much math
[00:24:55.240]  like I just want to be able to talk about it.
[00:24:57.720]  You're like let me pull up Zillow real quick what is a reasonable rent price to say out loud at this table?
[00:25:04.440]  Exactly. That's pretty funny but actually recently my brother moved in with his girlfriend.
[00:25:14.680]  My parents were really chill about it so I was like whoa I guess my parents have come around
[00:25:20.280]  but I think my parents I have asked them about it before.
[00:25:24.600]  They said a couple living together before marriage they can handle that but if they live together for too long
[00:25:33.000]  before marriage then they start feeling a little iffy about it like oh well if you live together for so long
[00:25:39.400]  why don't you just get married already right and so I was like okay
[00:25:43.720]  good to know I guess. That's really interesting. I wonder if even our parents thoughts about the
[00:25:50.600]  concept of marriage and our thoughts about the concept of marriage are different because sometimes
[00:25:55.800]  I feel like it's almost like a logistical concept to them of like well you might as well be made
[00:26:01.960]  or you should get married because blah blah whereas for us it's kind of like a fantasy almost.
[00:26:07.560]  Oh yeah maybe. So here is where a concept that I learned recently from my therapist really comes in.
[00:26:17.240]  I thought this was super profound so my therapist said that this is very common among like
[00:26:23.400]  immigrants and children of immigrants basically the immigrating generation they're experiencing a lot
[00:26:30.680]  of change. They're literally you know leaving home going to a brand new country learning a new
[00:26:36.360]  language etc etc so they're experiencing a lot of change and so what they search for is stability
[00:26:43.000]  and so I can see how in this situation like marriage is a form of stability and like kind of more
[00:26:49.880]  logistical like you just said. And then us being like the children of immigrants we live in the
[00:26:56.600]  stability that they've created and searched for all their lives so since we already have this
[00:27:03.000]  stability we kind of look for change. Whoa dude that's wild actually yeah it makes a lot of
[00:27:09.880]  sense now that you put it that way. Yeah so I guess us searching for relationships and stuff it's
[00:27:15.960]  not necessarily for that stability factor like we kind of have our thoughts rooted in like you said
[00:27:23.080]  fantasy or like wow this will be like some great love of my life and getting married is a big change
[00:27:31.080]  that kind of stuff versus like oh getting married is like stability in my life and that will
[00:27:36.760]  anchor me down through all this like chaos and change that I'm experiencing. Dude actually it
[00:27:43.400]  also ties up really well too because I think you mentioned that your parents got married before
[00:27:48.440]  they immigrated and the like impending immigration was kind of like one of the factors and that's
[00:27:54.040]  actually really similar for my parents as well where my dad knew that he had a really cool job
[00:27:59.320]  opportunity where after a couple years he was going to be sent out to the US to kind of work at
[00:28:04.360]  the branches there. So then he was like okay I need to find the one that I can like do all of these
[00:28:10.440]  things and go through all the trials and tribulations of life with and for someone like me it's kind
[00:28:15.320]  of interesting because if I had to really choose I feel like my parents are the ones who are more
[00:28:21.160]  willing to take risks versus I'm the risk of our one where I'm like I don't even know if I want to
[00:28:26.520]  move to a new city or move to a new state like that seems like too big for me.
[00:28:31.720]  You know honestly I can kind of see that for you though because I think you have gone through
[00:28:36.520]  a lot of change. You aren't the major immigrant I guess if that makes sense. For example like your
[00:28:45.640]  parents they moved away from your hometown essentially like when we were still pretty young.
[00:28:52.680]  So I think that was a big change and if anything I feel like your parents move around like a
[00:28:57.000]  decent amount so that's kind of a lot of change in terms of maybe home-based kind of because
[00:29:03.880]  I think I still kind of view my parents' home as home-based at times.
[00:29:08.600]  I can see how that causes you to be like oh I need to find more stability and then end up
[00:29:14.760]  participating in more like risk-averse actions. It's like my parents' immigration slash moving
[00:29:24.040]  around is affecting me like that's the change in my life. Yeah it's too much. Makes sense honestly.
[00:29:29.720]  Yeah because I would say like in comparison to you I think I'm definitely a little more risk-taking
[00:29:37.320]  at least compared to my parents but I think overall as a person I still lean towards risk-averse
[00:29:43.960]  and I think maybe that's also just from us like growing up and seeing our parents being risk-averse
[00:29:49.960]  so then it's like okay then maybe that is like the right behavior or the like good behavior that
[00:29:56.600]  I should be modeling myself after. Right the more I think about it the more I wonder what other
[00:30:03.720]  aspects of life we can kind of attribute this to. So safer like finances for example right people
[00:30:11.720]  in our generation tend to have a little bit of a different attitude about it than people in our
[00:30:15.800]  parents' generation. I don't know if your parents were huge into investing but I feel like
[00:30:22.200]  our generation is like very much into that, very much into credit card churning. All of these things
[00:30:27.400]  I feel like are very commonly discussed and talked about in people in our generation especially
[00:30:32.680]  things like opening a credit card or like what credit card is the best. Sometimes I find myself
[00:30:37.160]  being the one to kind of explain things like that to my parents and I would say I'm far from an
[00:30:41.560]  expert on those things. So do you think this like risk-averse kind of attitude can also apply
[00:30:48.200]  to the way we look at finances as well? Yes I think when you're talking about credit cards that
[00:30:53.720]  was totally something I could relate to. My parents they like never get credit cards with annual fees.
[00:31:02.200]  So I have a couple that have annual fees and so sometimes when they hear about it they're like
[00:31:08.280]  in all this shock. So like you know one of the most common ones is either chase Sapphire or like
[00:31:14.600]  MX Platt and they have high annual fees. So I had Sapphire for a while and when my parents found out
[00:31:22.680]  because they're like oh that card looks nice like what card is that? And I'm like oh it's the Sapphire
[00:31:26.760]  and I'm listing out all these benefits and then they're like oh does it have an annual fee? I'm like um
[00:31:33.480]  yeah it's like $400 and they're like what the fuck? And I think in their eyes it's always like
[00:31:42.360]  well we're trying not to spend money like the purpose of credit cards is not to spend more money but
[00:31:47.080]  to I don't know just have a way of spending money I guess. So I guess in their eyes it's like oh my
[00:31:53.080]  god if I'm gonna pay like $400 on this credit card is it even worth it? They're not even thinking
[00:31:58.680]  about the perks I think and sometimes the perks don't even apply to them so I think that is a great
[00:32:05.000]  example and it's not even necessarily risk versus not risk but it's definitely just like the way
[00:32:11.480]  that we manage like finances and view purchases. Yeah and I feel like they also have a completely
[00:32:20.520]  different idea on what they consider like a waste of money slash a good investment because
[00:32:27.640]  okay this is honestly probably just a bad habit of mine personally but I eat out a lot
[00:32:33.720]  so like busy days or whatever I'm in a bad mood I'm like okay we're gonna go out to eat or
[00:32:38.680]  we'll like do it or something and I feel like that's like my toxic trait. But to me sometimes it's
[00:32:42.760]  worth it because the convenience makes up for the cost right but I feel like my parents never
[00:32:49.240]  eat out they eat out significantly more when I'm there or they'll of course eat out for social
[00:32:55.000]  occasions but when it's just them too they always eat in and I guess I find that so fascinating
[00:33:01.240]  where I'm like how can you just eat the same thing every day if my mom is a great chef
[00:33:06.920]  but every day is like a little bit crazy to me. It is. Also I'm thinking like you know not everyone
[00:33:13.320]  likes to cook and sometimes you just really need the break from cooking right in our eyes
[00:33:19.160]  the money is worth the sanity essentially right exactly and then sometimes I'm like oh dude if
[00:33:25.080]  you don't want to cook then why don't we just go out and eat and then everyone will be happy
[00:33:30.440]  but then I guess it's just rooted in their values and stuff that they're like oh fuck I'll just
[00:33:35.080]  cook something simple you know we don't have to spend money. We're like okay like your sanity.
[00:33:41.160]  Yeah and I feel like something really similar can be tied to like shopping habits as well
[00:33:46.440]  where I guess to be fair when my parents spend or buy something that's really high quality like
[00:33:51.960]  they will definitely invest the money in it but like on a daily basis I feel like my mom is like oh
[00:33:58.760]  for shoes like why would I get something from Nordstrom when I can just go to Nordstrom rack or
[00:34:03.880]  Marshalls or TJ Maxx she's always hunting for that good deal yeah and I feel like I was very much
[00:34:09.400]  so like raised and like steeped in that attitude but nowadays I'm kind of like okay I'm gonna go
[00:34:15.640]  for things that I really specifically want like specific models and stuff that I want instead of
[00:34:21.880]  just trying to find the best deal at TJ Maxx or the best deal at Marshalls I don't know like I feel
[00:34:27.640]  like my parents are they do well for themselves but yeah there's still like bargain hunting and
[00:34:32.440]  stuff which I'm always like fascinated by. Yeah I guess it's just their habit almost now it's
[00:34:39.320]  like so ingrained in them it's kind of funny my parents are definitely very similar and my dad will
[00:34:45.000]  always go to similar stores that you mentioned and you know sometimes it's clothes that are maybe
[00:34:50.760]  like a weird color or kind of like a hodgepodge of stuff at these stores right so my dad will just
[00:34:57.000]  buy these like super cheap bright crazy colored clothes I guess it kind of works out because most
[00:35:04.840]  of them are like workout or like hiking clothes but I'm just sometimes I see my dad step out in
[00:35:11.000]  these outfits of just like crazy vibrant colors and I'm like no you know like I'm not trying to
[00:35:20.840]  be dressed like that because sometimes they'll sometimes they'll be like they'll send a photo
[00:35:26.040]  they're like oh I was shopping and I saw this like do you want it and it's like some bright like
[00:35:30.360]  pink shit and I'm like thank you for thinking about me really but I don't think I want that you know
[00:35:39.000]  feel like I appreciate the gesture yeah I guess it's like we have the privilege of growing up in
[00:35:46.600]  this much more stable situation so we're able to be like oh yeah like I can be a little bit more
[00:35:53.880]  picky and schoozy with what I want to buy versus like this is a great deal I will focus on the
[00:36:00.440]  great deals only not to say like I'm not gonna pass up a great deal right but like ultimately
[00:36:05.480]  it's kind of like oh I really want this so maybe I'll wait for this to go on sale versus like
[00:36:10.840]  these are on sale I'll pick out of these yeah I think that's like the perfect way to put it actually
[00:36:16.440]  and honestly now that I'm thinking about it I'm like damn maybe the way I had initially
[00:36:21.160]  ordered it was a little bit giving spoiled fat because I feel like my parents do not hesitate
[00:36:27.400]  to spend any expense on me but they will do the like bargain hunting for themselves so I'm like oh my
[00:36:33.080]  on single tier like is this what happens when you're a parent where you're like I don't want the
[00:36:37.720]  there's like this famous phrase and create that's like where once you're a parent you're like oh it's
[00:36:41.480]  okay child like you could have all my money I can survive off of $10 this week oh my god that is
[00:36:48.360]  probably definitely the vibe but maybe not when the kids growing up because the crazy growth spurts
[00:36:55.080]  you're like no you're getting like the cheapest shit for now until you're done growing the truth
[00:37:01.320]  do it the other day I was like cleaning out some old shit from my closet and since my parents
[00:37:07.160]  moved a bunch like I felt like a lot of the like childhood relics I kind of was storing in the US
[00:37:12.840]  so I was sifting through a bunch of them and one of them was this like really old north face jacket
[00:37:17.960]  I had begged my parents to buy it for me when I was a freshman so that was 2010 or 2011 so this
[00:37:24.040]  jacket is already like almost a teenager right or it is a teenager actually I was like yeah I should
[00:37:29.400]  probably donate this but I just couldn't let go of it because I was like I remember back in the day
[00:37:34.120]  this was like it was expensive to spend like a hundred dollars on a jacket and I had like
[00:37:38.600]  begged my parents that I could wear this for a lifetime I just couldn't bring myself to toss it so
[00:37:44.040]  I think I'm gonna keep it as like a memory item like I used to wear every single fucking day
[00:37:49.240]  in high school so it was like oh that's going back then I don't know it's just like things like
[00:37:53.080]  that I feel like really stick with me yeah does it fit you still it's like slightly tight so I'm
[00:37:58.840]  gonna have to go on a couple diets but it'll hang well in the closet for until I'm there maybe your
[00:38:05.400]  parents knew when they bought it that like it wasn't going to be a lifetime item but they were I'm
[00:38:11.000]  sure they were very happy to see you wear it so much when you did get it though yeah that's true
[00:38:16.840]  now it's an antique item yeah to think it's a teenager now dude I know that got me thinking just
[00:38:26.200]  about how I probably begged my parents to buy you know specific clothing items or like random
[00:38:33.320]  items and I think I definitely pulled that line too like I could use this for the rest of my life
[00:38:39.480]  and maybe in their mind it's like no she isn't going to but I guess she's very desperate for it
[00:38:45.880]  so I guess I'll cave this time damn that's true I mean I'm sure they've seen it all at that point yeah
[00:38:51.960]  I guess kind of along the lines of parenthood I think having a family and the concept of
[00:39:01.160]  family has also evolved across multiple generations so do you think the idea of a family
[00:39:07.160]  and the idea of parenthood has changed from our parents generation to ours um I feel like having kids
[00:39:16.120]  is such a given in my parents generation and previous generations it's like such a it's not even
[00:39:24.280]  a question it's like this is just a part of life like you get married and have kids but I guess
[00:39:30.760]  like in our generation more and more people are starting to think about whether they even want
[00:39:36.120]  to have kids right whether that's something you know they want in their lives but I feel like at
[00:39:41.720]  the same time some people experience pressure from their parents like oh can't wait till I have
[00:39:46.680]  that grand kid and then we're like um I don't know if I want to have kids yeah I feel like it's a very
[00:39:53.640]  common conversation topic actually especially like for girl talks or talks with our girlfriends right
[00:39:59.080]  it's like I definitely think I've heard it a lot where people are like I'm not sure if I want to
[00:40:04.840]  have kids if I do it's like maybe one maximum two versus I know in our parents generation
[00:40:11.800]  I feel like two was almost the standard back then yeah yeah I feel like there's a good amount of
[00:40:16.920]  people who have at least one sibling and I also wonder maybe it's because when people immigrated
[00:40:23.240]  out of China because one kid policy was going on back then they're like hey we're in America we might
[00:40:29.160]  as well have two children they're like well we moved all the way here yeah it's like the one child
[00:40:34.840]  policy is it's not out here so you know I mean I think even when it was my parents generation like both
[00:40:41.640]  of my parents have at least three siblings um my mom has four and I feel like for them having one
[00:40:48.760]  kid or two was already pairing down the number significantly that's already like a huge reduction
[00:40:54.200]  but honestly when the standard is two or one you can only go down to zero or one from their true
[00:41:02.920]  very very true the perception I have is that a lot of moms were relatively willing to just give up
[00:41:10.600]  their career and you know have a kid and take care of that kid because a lot of immigrant families
[00:41:17.720]  aren't rich so it's pretty hard to get a nanny and so it was kind of the norm I guess or maybe
[00:41:25.160]  very accepted slash natural for the man to become the breadwinner and then the woman becomes the
[00:41:32.840]  child care and nowadays like in our generation a lot more people want to have a career so I feel
[00:41:40.120]  like that is also maybe a difference because it's like oh shoot if I have a kid then you know that's
[00:41:45.160]  like almost a half a year of leave from my career and then I don't know like how that'll affect my
[00:41:53.000]  career path and all that kind of stuff so I feel like that's probably another factor yeah I think
[00:41:59.160]  like there's probably a lot of stuff that goes into this attitude change for sure so like
[00:42:04.840]  I wonder now in the US is it even possible to raise a kid comfortably like financially when
[00:42:11.640]  you don't have a double income stream or something like I know back in the day things like homes
[00:42:16.600]  were significantly more affordable like still not cheap right but just not like the $1 million plus
[00:42:23.000]  colossal cost that it is now so then I feel like just the logistics have changed a ton and yeah
[00:42:30.040]  I feel like in my parents' generation being a stay at home mom was super common but I'm not sure
[00:42:34.120]  how common it is anymore and then on top of that you add in the whole like complication of immigration
[00:42:40.440]  where you know if I would have a kid now there's family here that could kind of help with the
[00:42:45.320]  child rearing but for my parents unless my grandma was here visiting it was truly like them to
[00:42:51.720]  who had to take care of me or stay care which is another added expense so I can't imagine how it
[00:42:57.560]  was for them back then yeah really good point dude actually my brother who was born first um
[00:43:05.240]  why'd you really eyes um no reason but when he was born I think both my parents were still in school
[00:43:16.520]  so they were like oh it's gonna be like really difficult to raise him so they actually sent him
[00:43:22.600]  back to China wow to live with my grandparents for I think it was about a year maybe two some
[00:43:30.280]  amount of time between a year and two years and then I think my dad finished school so then they
[00:43:36.200]  brought my brother back because it was like okay now someone can work and we can actually support
[00:43:40.520]  this child but yeah I guess like that's what my parents managed to do but I know like sometimes
[00:43:46.680]  people will straight up just immigrate their parents too like the you know the grandparents over
[00:43:51.960]  to the US too and then they just live with the family and then some of these kids grow up like
[00:43:57.800]  essentially getting raised by their grandparents because their parents had to go out and work to
[00:44:02.120]  support the family yeah I think that's probably pretty similar to what James says childhood was like
[00:44:08.440]  where his grandma was definitely a huge factor in like helping raise him while his parents were
[00:44:13.160]  both working so yeah I feel like that's also another option as well but you're right like luckily
[00:44:20.040]  now that you know we're already immigrated here it's a little easier to be able to reach out to
[00:44:28.520]  family and be like hey can you babysit this weekend or something like that right dude and I've
[00:44:35.880]  been having some crazy thoughts lately like I saw that other day some vague tick talk about how
[00:44:40.760]  equinox had some sort of daycare system were like some sort of play area for the kids while the
[00:44:46.600]  parents worked out and I was like is this free daycare like should I just get it equinox membership
[00:44:53.560]  like oh I see that's how they get you yeah even now getting a babysitter is not cheap especially if
[00:45:02.440]  they're working during the work days when the parents are at work I feel like if anything now
[00:45:09.000]  businesses booming for these caretakers true also speaking of you know having kids and working jobs
[00:45:15.800]  I feel like careers in itself is also another area where there's a difference generationally you know
[00:45:22.840]  kind of time back to the idea of like willingness to take a risk slash change things up this is where
[00:45:29.720]  I see myself being a little more willing to take a risk because for my parents they're very
[00:45:38.040]  focused on stability so they're like you should become a software engineer because I know you'll
[00:45:43.000]  be able to get a job there's a lot of those jobs in the Bay Area and it's a pretty well-paying
[00:45:49.000]  job as well so you know you'll be able to support yourself I was like no I'm gonna go major in
[00:45:53.960]  econ and they're like what does that even mean and I was like I don't know but I'll figure
[00:45:58.040]  out you know so I think definitely in that area and then also I've mentioned in the podcast before
[00:46:05.400]  where I had like a contractor job for a while so at first when I wanted to take that job my parents
[00:46:10.840]  were like no like this is a contractor job you won't have like held insurance to the level of you
[00:46:16.840]  know full-time employees and you won't have the same benefits also there's a time limit you know
[00:46:22.520]  you can be a contractor for a maximum of two years for this specific company and I was like no
[00:46:27.880]  I think it'll be okay like I think I want to take this risk because I could potentially get a
[00:46:33.080]  full-time job after and they're like I don't know like this seems too risky like I don't understand
[00:46:39.880]  but you know it ended up working out well but I could totally see that difference there they're
[00:46:45.800]  just like no what is this please no but I was like I think it'll be okay yeah I feel like
[00:46:52.280]  also parents are very into jobs where you can lock in and stay for like 10 plus years like I
[00:46:59.480]  feel like that generation really values like long-term stability sort of in the bay at least I know
[00:47:05.960]  for a while people were saying oh the best way to increase your salary is to job hop every one
[00:47:10.360]  to two years and I said that at the dinner table once my parents pretty early on in my career
[00:47:17.160]  and I was like yeah people nowadays have been saying you stay for a maximum of two years because
[00:47:21.560]  otherwise you get pigeoned hold into the salary that you were hired at and they were like but how
[00:47:27.400]  are you gonna learn and grow and I was like well I think when people hop jobs you kind of get
[00:47:33.400]  like a promotion and they were like I don't think that makes any sense like how would you learn
[00:47:37.240]  anything and I was like I'm like I don't know that's what all the young people are saying
[00:47:42.040]  and I feel like that's truly like the difference where back then like your company and your work
[00:47:49.000]  was a lot more serious and I'm not saying that I don't find my work serious but I think our generation
[00:47:55.480]  has kind of sensed or like realized that companies aren't like your friend right like HR isn't
[00:48:02.600]  your friend companies are prioritizing like shareholders above the employees a lot of the times
[00:48:10.440]  so then I don't think it's like personally offensive for employees to prioritize themselves
[00:48:15.560]  over the company but I think that's just totally different attitudes from our parents
[00:48:20.760]  all about that loyalty and stability
[00:48:24.440]  but yeah I feel like it's just so interesting once I learned about this concept of you know
[00:48:32.280]  people experiencing change look for stability and people experiencing stability look for change
[00:48:37.160]  and I feel like super applicable for that generational gap between us and our parents and super
[00:48:44.680]  relatable for just you know people who are going through different things and so after learning
[00:48:50.120]  about that concept I was mind blown and I really felt like I gained better perspective
[00:48:56.040]  it's really fun discussing how this concept plays in with our generational gap
[00:49:02.040]  and for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts on the different outlooks you have
