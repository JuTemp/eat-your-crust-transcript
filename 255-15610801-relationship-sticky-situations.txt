[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_01]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal.
[00:00:03.160] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:04.340] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm Eugene.
[00:00:16.490] [SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, Eugene.
[00:00:18.350] [SPEAKER_03]: Last time you were on the podcast with us was episode 193, Hinge Profiles and First Dates.
[00:00:24.830] [SPEAKER_03]: And today we're super excited to have you on because we have a kind of spicy array of questions to discuss.
[00:00:32.110] [SPEAKER_03]: So today's episode, we'll dive into any sort of sticky situations regarding our ex,
[00:00:38.210] [SPEAKER_03]: our SO or anything in between.
[00:00:41.390] [SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with an easy one to kind of ease us into the day.
[00:00:45.530] [SPEAKER_03]: So if you bumped into your ex, would you say hi?
[00:00:49.610] [SPEAKER_00]: This happened a few months ago.
[00:00:50.910] [SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say hi. Oh, so OK, OK, OK.
[00:00:55.690] [SPEAKER_00]: What happened was I knew she was going to be somewhere with mutual friends.
[00:01:00.650] [SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know she was ready.
[00:01:03.530] [SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm ready.
[00:01:05.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Who knows? Maybe maybe I wasn't.
[00:01:06.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know. But like we were at the bar and I saw one of her friends.
[00:01:10.370] [SPEAKER_00]: I said hi and I saw her like on the other side.
[00:01:13.890] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, I'm going to pretend we didn't see each other,
[00:01:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]: you know, because maybe you didn't see me.
[00:01:20.290] [SPEAKER_00]: So in that instance, I didn't say hi, but generally I would.
[00:01:23.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know. Yeah.
[00:01:26.510] [SPEAKER_00]: I live what I preach.
[00:01:27.670] [SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't, but you would.
[00:01:32.210] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like it depends on so much, right?
[00:01:35.190] [SPEAKER_00]: How ready you are, how ready they are.
[00:01:37.650] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I try to at least keep be cautious about it and not if it was
[00:01:42.470] [SPEAKER_00]: like a bad breakup or if it was like there's still some feelings or like
[00:01:46.530] [SPEAKER_00]: whatever in this on both sides, and probably best not to.
[00:01:50.230] [SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess that's fair.
[00:01:52.710] [SPEAKER_01]: The key being like if you feel ready to say hi.
[00:01:55.750] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[00:01:57.430] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you guys do in the past?
[00:02:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I think I am fine with saying hi.
[00:02:03.450] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just it's sometimes too
[00:02:05.270] [SPEAKER_01]: awkward if you've clearly seen each other and you're just ignoring them.
[00:02:10.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Like there's there's just like awkward tension that would build up.
[00:02:13.570] [SPEAKER_01]: So I would probably just end up saying hi.
[00:02:16.550] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think it breaks the ice a bit where it's like I have nothing against
[00:02:20.170] [SPEAKER_01]: you. We can say hi to each other.
[00:02:22.090] [SPEAKER_00]: What do you say after you say hi?
[00:02:23.750] [SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the situation.
[00:02:25.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Like where are you?
[00:02:26.690] [SPEAKER_01]: Like crazy seeing you here.
[00:02:28.210] [SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[00:02:29.410] [SPEAKER_01]: And then quickly walk away, I guess.
[00:02:32.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. How's life been?
[00:02:33.910] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right. Yeah.
[00:02:35.990] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I actually did bump into an ex before.
[00:02:39.450] [SPEAKER_01]: There were like a couple of times one time was at a party and it was like
[00:02:44.250] [SPEAKER_01]: kind of awkward because we clearly both saw each other, but no one made the
[00:02:49.270] [SPEAKER_01]: move to say hi. It went on for so long that I just
[00:02:52.410] [SPEAKER_01]: felt so uncomfortable that I was like, OK, if this guy's not going to break the
[00:02:56.110] [SPEAKER_01]: ice and I will I'll just say hi.
[00:02:58.410] [SPEAKER_01]: I tried to make a joke out of it.
[00:03:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hi.
[00:03:01.790] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, what did I say?
[00:03:03.510] [SPEAKER_00]: Close the joke.
[00:03:04.210] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like you're not going to say hi.
[00:03:08.670] [SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we just like chatted for a bit and it was pretty
[00:03:12.910] [SPEAKER_03]: chill. See, I feel like that's like the
[00:03:14.890] [SPEAKER_03]: respectable thing to do, and it's what I wish I could do.
[00:03:19.090] [SPEAKER_03]: But every time I've seen my exes, I've always either run away or like
[00:03:25.210] [SPEAKER_03]: kind of awkwardly coexist near them if it's like a party and it's unavoidable.
[00:03:29.870] [SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be really crazy and double standardy.
[00:03:32.850] [SPEAKER_03]: So don't come for me.
[00:03:34.570] [SPEAKER_03]: But even though I don't have the balls to say hi, I sometimes judge
[00:03:38.830] [SPEAKER_03]: my ex for not coming up and saying hi.
[00:03:41.930] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the courage to do it, but you also don't have the courage to do it.
[00:03:45.910] [SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[00:03:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like I don't do it.
[00:03:49.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever. But you like, I thought I thought you were better than that.
[00:03:54.010] [SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[00:03:55.650] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like, I don't know.
[00:03:57.850] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you want to be the bigger person and you want to be like, oh,
[00:04:01.650] [SPEAKER_00]: I am comfortable saying hi because I'm winning in life or whatever.
[00:04:06.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Compared to your ex.
[00:04:07.810] [SPEAKER_00]: That's like the main thought that goes to my head where it's like,
[00:04:10.130] [SPEAKER_00]: at the very least, I have to act super chill and like nothing.
[00:04:14.150] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm unfazed.
[00:04:15.070] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm very demure and shit, you know?
[00:04:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]: But whether that involves saying hi, it depends on them too, in a way.
[00:04:22.870] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know. I mean, maybe it's different for you guys, but like, OK,
[00:04:25.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that has broken up with most of my exes.
[00:04:29.450] [SPEAKER_00]: So I always feel like the more guilty one.
[00:04:33.210] [SPEAKER_00]: It's not up to me whether you want me to say hi type of stuff.
[00:04:36.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.
[00:04:37.650] [SPEAKER_03]: So does this mean there's a little bit of fear of rejection involved where
[00:04:41.490] [SPEAKER_03]: maybe you feel like you're over it and you're good and you want to reach
[00:04:44.710] [SPEAKER_03]: out and say hi, but what if they are still going through shit or there's
[00:04:48.470] [SPEAKER_03]: something unresolved there and they might not want to actively interact with you?
[00:04:52.790] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never thought about it as fear of rejection.
[00:04:55.670] [SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely that to an extent.
[00:04:57.610] [SPEAKER_00]: It's also definitely a feeling of like, oh,
[00:05:00.390] [SPEAKER_00]: if I'm the one who broke up with you, then you are the one that has to
[00:05:04.130] [SPEAKER_00]: react to it and then, like, you know, respond to it, build your own life
[00:05:07.810] [SPEAKER_00]: up, do your own thing, whatever.
[00:05:09.370] [SPEAKER_00]: So like, I don't want to impede on that, I guess.
[00:05:12.810] [SPEAKER_00]: But yes, also fear of rejection because I say hi to like, it was an
[00:05:16.410] [SPEAKER_00]: autonomy growing.
[00:05:18.790] [SPEAKER_01]: Wow. Wow.
[00:05:19.750] [SPEAKER_01]: Wait, but then even if you're the person who broke up with the other person,
[00:05:23.490] [SPEAKER_01]: don't you feel like you still also have to go through exactly what you said?
[00:05:27.270] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, rebuild.
[00:05:28.710] [SPEAKER_00]: You're okay.
[00:05:30.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[00:05:31.310] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm super chill.
[00:05:32.150] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[00:05:32.790] [SPEAKER_00]: The way I think about it is if I'm breaking up with them,
[00:05:36.370] [SPEAKER_00]: if I'm deciding before they do and it's not mutual, then I already kind
[00:05:40.370] [SPEAKER_00]: of went through that process a bit.
[00:05:42.010] [SPEAKER_01]: I see like you had a head start, like you were mentally prepared for it.
[00:05:45.730] [SPEAKER_00]: I did have a head start.
[00:05:46.710] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:05:47.910] [SPEAKER_01]: I think beyond all of that, though, isn't it just like really awkward if
[00:05:52.110] [SPEAKER_01]: you see your ex, you both see each other and you just ignore each other?
[00:05:57.370] [SPEAKER_01]: It's like almost rude, right?
[00:06:00.570] [SPEAKER_00]: It's a little on who?
[00:06:02.590] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean, OK, think about it this way.
[00:06:04.310] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess, like in specific situations, it can feel kind of rude or weird.
[00:06:08.730] [SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you bump into them at like a party and then you're in a circle
[00:06:13.970] [SPEAKER_01]: chatting with everyone, you're just completely ignoring one person
[00:06:17.530] [SPEAKER_01]: in that circle because they're your ex.
[00:06:20.030] [SPEAKER_03]: It is rude, but there's ways to tiptoe around it to make it not awkward or
[00:06:25.570] [SPEAKER_03]: obvious because if you're having a group conversation, you can respond
[00:06:30.350] [SPEAKER_03]: to or react to someone saying something without actively engaging
[00:06:34.590] [SPEAKER_03]: in it or even addressing them.
[00:06:36.270] [SPEAKER_03]: So, for example, if we were in a group and my ex said something that was funny,
[00:06:40.270] [SPEAKER_03]: I would be like, oh, ha ha.
[00:06:41.970] [SPEAKER_03]: And I can even add my joke on top, but I don't have to say his name or be
[00:06:46.710] [SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, that was a great joke so and so.
[00:06:49.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Because why would you?
[00:06:51.330] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see.
[00:06:52.050] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's like acknowledging, but not.
[00:06:55.310] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[00:06:56.230] [SPEAKER_00]: My strat is if I went to my ex at a party or a gathering,
[00:07:00.590] [SPEAKER_00]: when I'm doing my rounds, I will also say hi to them.
[00:07:03.690] [SPEAKER_00]: But I got to move on as other people say hi to.
[00:07:06.150] [SPEAKER_00]: But then I already did my job.
[00:07:07.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I made my presence known and now I will not talk to you for the rest of the night.
[00:07:12.070] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's chill.
[00:07:13.290] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I think that's totally fair because you acknowledged them at least once.
[00:07:17.210] [SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, no one said you had to keep talking to them.
[00:07:21.970] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:07:22.410] [SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a situation where two people are exes and they just don't
[00:07:25.930] [SPEAKER_00]: even acknowledge ever.
[00:07:28.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, and they're in the same room.
[00:07:30.350] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. That's kind of crazy.
[00:07:31.410] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:07:32.170] [SPEAKER_01]: I will admit I've seen that before.
[00:07:36.270] [SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[00:07:37.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Stand in the middle like, well, how do you guys know each other?
[00:07:41.950] [SPEAKER_01]: It's unique.
[00:07:43.410] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, at least when I've seen it, everyone in the room knows.
[00:07:46.590] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's less awkward.
[00:07:48.890] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think if no one in the room knows, it's definitely more awkward.
[00:07:52.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, is it just me or do these people have really bad energy?
[00:07:57.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the thing, too.
[00:07:58.890] [SPEAKER_03]: If everyone in the room knows,
[00:08:01.550] [SPEAKER_03]: then when you make your rounds and say hi to people,
[00:08:04.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's audience mode.
[00:08:07.170] [SPEAKER_03]: So you say hi to everyone and then you get to your ex and everyone is just
[00:08:10.890] [SPEAKER_03]: staring at you or even if they aren't, it just feels like that mentally.
[00:08:15.330] [SPEAKER_03]: So then I feel like it adds to the pressure of, do I even want to say hi
[00:08:18.570] [SPEAKER_03]: or should I just be like, oh, gonna go chat the person right next
[00:08:22.570] [SPEAKER_03]: to the ex up for 20 minutes now?
[00:08:25.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Wait, so you would watch Jisoo?
[00:08:27.130] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I would turn away from secondhand embarrassment.
[00:08:30.510] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I am not above being a spectator.
[00:08:34.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah. Dude, it's so fascinating.
[00:08:39.210] [SPEAKER_00]: Like two animals in the wild.
[00:08:41.570] [SPEAKER_00]: But they're not looking.
[00:08:43.070] [SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through this kind of but like
[00:08:44.890] [SPEAKER_00]: through texts where my college group, me and my ex were both in it.
[00:08:50.510] [SPEAKER_00]: So when we do post-college hangouts,
[00:08:53.770] [SPEAKER_00]: it's like a game of who replies first.
[00:08:56.210] [SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes, oh, all right,
[00:08:57.890] [SPEAKER_00]: it's her hangout now or it's my hangout based on which ex replies first.
[00:09:02.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I stopped doing that because after a point, I was like, oh, like this is lame.
[00:09:07.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to hang out with my friends too.
[00:09:08.770] [SPEAKER_00]: But like for a period,
[00:09:10.750] [SPEAKER_00]: everyone in the group kind of assumed or respected that.
[00:09:14.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like, OK, like if my ex said she's down and I haven't responded yet,
[00:09:19.810] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably not showing up.
[00:09:22.530] [SPEAKER_01]: The silent claim.
[00:09:26.210] [SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you got it. You got it this round.
[00:09:27.970] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll come back stronger next round.
[00:09:29.790] [SPEAKER_00]: But you're quick.
[00:09:30.590] [SPEAKER_03]: You're like fighting for each hangout.
[00:09:33.530] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like instant responses all the time.
[00:09:36.610] [SPEAKER_00]: Dude, dude, one time they came back after not seeing us for a year.
[00:09:40.530] [SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the people in the group, they're like, oh, everyone,
[00:09:42.710] [SPEAKER_00]: I miss you guys. I haven't seen you guys in so long.
[00:09:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]: And then she replied in five minutes.
[00:09:46.450] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, well, yeah.
[00:09:48.990] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I had to be like, you know what?
[00:09:50.790] [SPEAKER_00]: No more of this.
[00:09:52.330] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:54.810] [SPEAKER_03]: There is kind of a weird political divide thing that does happen, though,
[00:09:58.610] [SPEAKER_03]: especially if you and your ex shared a bunch of different friend groups.
[00:10:02.510] [SPEAKER_03]: But I do have a question for you guys.
[00:10:06.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you be OK if your friend got with one of your exes?
[00:10:10.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I think honestly, this really depends on the ex.
[00:10:14.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not the friend and maybe the friend too.
[00:10:17.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Which is more important, the friend or the ex?
[00:10:19.690] [SPEAKER_01]: I think the ex is probably more important at first.
[00:10:24.150] [SPEAKER_01]: How long you dated and like, you know, how deep was that relationship?
[00:10:27.710] [SPEAKER_01]: If it was like, you know, some random high school ex that you don't really care
[00:10:31.310] [SPEAKER_01]: about anymore, it really doesn't matter, like no matter who your friend is,
[00:10:35.030] [SPEAKER_01]: probably for the most part.
[00:10:37.010] [SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, after that level,
[00:10:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: it would be like, how close are you to that friend?
[00:10:42.470] [SPEAKER_03]: So I guess for ease of the question,
[00:10:44.690] [SPEAKER_03]: let's say this friend is someone who knows you pretty well and has
[00:10:49.190] [SPEAKER_03]: definitely seen and known that you've dated this guy.
[00:10:52.490] [SPEAKER_03]: It's not like she's belatedly like, oh, my God,
[00:10:54.510] [SPEAKER_03]: like, I had no idea you dated him.
[00:10:56.090] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like she knew and you know, she knew.
[00:10:59.850] [SPEAKER_00]: She was there.
[00:11:01.070] [SPEAKER_00]: She hung out with you guys.
[00:11:02.270] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still same.
[00:11:03.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, it still depends on the relationship and the friendship.
[00:11:07.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you care if she asks for your permission or not?
[00:11:12.050] [SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I OK, I feel like that's such a hard position to be in,
[00:11:15.810] [SPEAKER_01]: but I get the intention because like the intention is good, right?
[00:11:19.210] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, I just want to let you know that I know you dated this
[00:11:22.850] [SPEAKER_01]: person and, you know, whatever is happening.
[00:11:25.630] [SPEAKER_01]: But then also suddenly what?
[00:11:28.450] [SPEAKER_01]: You're the decision maker for their entire relationship.
[00:11:32.830] [SPEAKER_01]: You're the final stamp of approval.
[00:11:35.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's probably
[00:11:38.410] [SPEAKER_00]: a nice thing to do to inform you, at least let you know before it gets super
[00:11:43.950] [SPEAKER_00]: serious like, hey, I'm talking to this person, you guys dated, I know, you know?
[00:11:49.410] [SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, because it's like, OK,
[00:11:51.370] [SPEAKER_00]: what if one of your friends is like a dog and you know this?
[00:11:55.410] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what I mean?
[00:11:57.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, like, you all you guys are very close.
[00:11:59.070] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know that person like, hey,
[00:12:00.950] [SPEAKER_00]: they can get into their like maybe not like boyfriend girlfriend material.
[00:12:05.390] Right.
[00:12:06.030] [SPEAKER_01]: Dude, honestly, like there's only so much you can do.
[00:12:08.510] [SPEAKER_01]: It's out of your hands, right?
[00:12:09.730] [SPEAKER_01]: Like who are you to meddle in their lives?
[00:12:13.190] [SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[00:12:14.270] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Crystal, I think on the general principles of this.
[00:12:17.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm the only petty one because I feel like it would really bother me.
[00:12:21.550] [SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were so quiet the whole time.
[00:12:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, nah, nah, bitch.
[00:12:24.350] [SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait, you guys agree?
[00:12:26.190] [SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here's the thing.
[00:12:26.890] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, like, what are you going to do about it?
[00:12:28.990] [SPEAKER_03]: If they are meant to be or whatever, all power to them.
[00:12:31.870] [SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like it's definitely going to be one of those things that's like,
[00:12:36.210] [SPEAKER_03]: you know, like a juicy gossip story.
[00:12:37.930] [SPEAKER_03]: So then on those late night outs or if you're like drinking,
[00:12:41.190] [SPEAKER_03]: it's like a fun party story to share to be like, oh, my God, guess what's up?
[00:12:45.110] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, isn't it crazy?
[00:12:46.530] [SPEAKER_03]: And I would just at the very least gossip a little bit about it.
[00:12:50.790] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I mean, I would definitely be bothered
[00:12:53.010] [SPEAKER_01]: if it was like a meaningful relationship and it was like a close friend.
[00:12:57.250] [SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably be like, wait, what the fuck?
[00:12:58.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Why are you trying to date my ex? Right.
[00:13:00.830] [SPEAKER_01]: True.
[00:13:01.350] [SPEAKER_01]: I think there's definitely a spectrum of where I do care and where I don't care.
[00:13:07.330] [SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[00:13:08.190] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like ideally you would know about this way before they start dating,
[00:13:11.690] [SPEAKER_00]: because if it's a close friend, they'd be like, hey, for some weird fucking reason,
[00:13:15.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with your ex again.
[00:13:16.570] [SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh, for some weird reason, I think they're cute.
[00:13:18.630] [SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to slowly be let down versus just like out of nowhere.
[00:13:25.810] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's just logically you're like, OK, who am I to meddle in their
[00:13:31.110] [SPEAKER_01]: lives, right? But then feeling wise, you can't help what you feel.
[00:13:34.450] [SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you'll definitely feel
[00:13:36.090] [SPEAKER_01]: kind of bothered or petty about it or upset about it.
[00:13:40.790] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think in a lot of ways,
[00:13:42.930] [SPEAKER_03]: complicated feelings about this is very natural.
[00:13:45.270] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like this person was in a specific role in your life and the other person
[00:13:49.730] [SPEAKER_03]: was, too. Now things are more things.
[00:13:51.370] [SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, what the fuck?
[00:13:53.030] [SPEAKER_03]: Especially if there wasn't that long
[00:13:55.610] [SPEAKER_03]: in between your breakup with this person and these two people getting together.
[00:14:00.570] [SPEAKER_03]: That would be fucked up.
[00:14:01.750] [SPEAKER_01]: I think that would bother me for sure.
[00:14:03.610] [SPEAKER_01]: If it's many, many years later,
[00:14:05.790] [SPEAKER_01]: you would hope that you're in a healthier spot and you're more OK with it.
[00:14:09.430] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it would feel a little weird at first,
[00:14:11.110] [SPEAKER_01]: but you would be able to quickly get over it.
[00:14:14.090] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Is it ever OK for your like one,
[00:14:18.030] [SPEAKER_00]: like your best friend or one of your close friends to like immediately start
[00:14:21.930] [SPEAKER_00]: dating your ex? No.
[00:14:24.270] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[00:14:25.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Probably not. They can wait.
[00:14:27.910] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. But also, like if you broke up with someone,
[00:14:32.610] [SPEAKER_01]: your best friend probably knows all the gory details and it's like, oh,
[00:14:36.530] [SPEAKER_01]: really, you're going to date them after all that.
[00:14:39.930] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would be very hard for me to not think like, OK,
[00:14:44.630] [SPEAKER_03]: so the whole time I was dating this guy, like were you crushing on him or
[00:14:49.310] [SPEAKER_03]: something, even if that was not even close to the truth,
[00:14:52.490] [SPEAKER_03]: I would still think that.
[00:14:54.650] [SPEAKER_00]: This has happened to me before.
[00:14:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]: The guy wasn't like a close friend, but he was like one of my ex's friends.
[00:15:03.590] [SPEAKER_00]: And we got along and stuff.
[00:15:05.110] [SPEAKER_00]: But when me and my ex went on a break
[00:15:06.910] [SPEAKER_00]: for like a month or something, and during that month he like started
[00:15:10.410] [SPEAKER_00]: hitting on her and then we got back together.
[00:15:13.790] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, I know about this.
[00:15:15.450] [SPEAKER_00]: And then when we broke up officially and then they got together,
[00:15:20.110] [SPEAKER_00]: it didn't feel great.
[00:15:21.450] [SPEAKER_00]: But it was also like, I mean, it's not like you said,
[00:15:24.330] [SPEAKER_00]: like you don't have any say in their lives or my ex's life.
[00:15:27.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. She can do whatever she wants.
[00:15:29.330] [SPEAKER_00]: It is really funny, though, the power that you have.
[00:15:31.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Like one time I picked him up from a party.
[00:15:33.930] [SPEAKER_00]: He was like walking out of a party and I saw him and I was
[00:15:36.910] [SPEAKER_00]: like, you want to ride? And he was like, sure.
[00:15:39.670] [SPEAKER_00]: And we were just in the car.
[00:15:40.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I was like, show how is ex?
[00:15:43.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[00:15:45.290] [SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I knew you hit on me.
[00:15:46.490] [SPEAKER_00]: I knew you had fun.
[00:15:47.950] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like messing with him.
[00:15:50.090] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:15:50.570] [SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[00:15:51.610] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually did have a situation back in high school.
[00:15:55.350] [SPEAKER_01]: Me and a good friend ended up dating like the same guy.
[00:15:59.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I dated him shortly after she dated him.
[00:16:03.510] [SPEAKER_01]: But it was kind of like I wasn't really sure what
[00:16:06.910] [SPEAKER_01]: was happening yet, because we're in high school.
[00:16:08.990] [SPEAKER_01]: We're stupid.
[00:16:10.030] [SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how to date people.
[00:16:11.670] [SPEAKER_01]: So it was during that talking phase.
[00:16:13.990] [SPEAKER_01]: And I guess my friend caught wind of it.
[00:16:17.130] [SPEAKER_01]: And she was actually so nice about it.
[00:16:19.130] [SPEAKER_01]: She texted me and said, oh, by the way,
[00:16:21.570] [SPEAKER_01]: I heard that you and ex are talking.
[00:16:25.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say it's not an issue
[00:16:27.430] [SPEAKER_01]: with me if you were to choose to date.
[00:16:30.270] [SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was really nice of her.
[00:16:32.610] [SPEAKER_01]: That's very mature, especially for high school.
[00:16:35.830] [SPEAKER_00]: W friend.
[00:16:37.750] Yeah.
[00:16:39.590] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's great because I think a few years later,
[00:16:42.730] [SPEAKER_01]: we were bonding over it.
[00:16:44.210] [SPEAKER_01]: We're like, dude, yeah, that dude that we used to date, what the fuck?
[00:16:48.690] [SPEAKER_03]: What came over us by then?
[00:16:51.350] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[00:16:51.650] [SPEAKER_03]: So I want to ask kind of the inverse
[00:16:54.010] [SPEAKER_03]: of this question, which is what if you met your new SO through an ex?
[00:17:00.490] [SPEAKER_03]: You were dating someone and then you broke up with them,
[00:17:03.290] [SPEAKER_03]: but you stayed close to or reconnected with your ex's friend and hit it off.
[00:17:07.790] [SPEAKER_03]: And now you're dating. Like, is that weird?
[00:17:10.490] [SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you're kind of obligated to feel guilty about it?
[00:17:13.970] [SPEAKER_03]: Or is it like fair game?
[00:17:16.190] [SPEAKER_00]: A true love is true love.
[00:17:17.210] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean? Like, I can't control that shit.
[00:17:18.930] [SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[00:17:21.230] [SPEAKER_01]: I think once again, it depends on how close they are to that ex.
[00:17:26.970] [SPEAKER_01]: If they're very peripheral friends,
[00:17:29.530] [SPEAKER_01]: maybe I'd feel less weird about it.
[00:17:32.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even not obligated to share that information to them.
[00:17:37.210] [SPEAKER_01]: But I guess if they were really close friends, I would feel pretty weird about it.
[00:17:41.330] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:17:42.190] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess at the very least, it's just like a hilarious situation where maybe
[00:17:46.770] [SPEAKER_03]: on anniversaries you would reminisce and be like, oh, remember when we met
[00:17:50.770] [SPEAKER_03]: through this one guy?
[00:17:53.510] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some of the most successful relationships I've heard are like that.
[00:17:58.710] [SPEAKER_00]: They come from that situation.
[00:18:00.410] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[00:18:01.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a concerning trend, but it seems to work.
[00:18:06.390] [SPEAKER_00]: So I can't hit on it.
[00:18:08.650] [SPEAKER_03]: It kind of makes sense in a lot of ways just because I feel like you're
[00:18:11.950] [SPEAKER_03]: attracted to a certain type of person usually and maybe the deviations
[00:18:17.030] [SPEAKER_03]: from that standard are very minimal.
[00:18:19.650] [SPEAKER_03]: Naturally, your SO's friends might be similar or have similar values as your SO.
[00:18:25.250] [SPEAKER_00]: Also, I assume a lot of people,
[00:18:27.350] [SPEAKER_00]: their friends are mostly like their own guys.
[00:18:31.130] [SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of guy friends or vice versa.
[00:18:33.430] [SPEAKER_00]: So it's like if you date someone, then you get to meet a lot of your
[00:18:37.470] [SPEAKER_00]: girlfriends, girlfriends, and it's like, oh,
[00:18:40.970] [SPEAKER_00]: there's just a larger number of people.
[00:18:44.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I guess they opened up the pool for you to do low key.
[00:18:49.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, this is like strategic dating.
[00:18:51.990] [SPEAKER_00]: If you were a complete dog, this is the way to do it.
[00:18:57.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Just date people to date their friends.
[00:18:59.770] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[00:19:01.990] [SPEAKER_01]: You see, this is why I don't like
[00:19:04.170] [SPEAKER_01]: dating people who have mutual friends because I don't like these sticky
[00:19:08.370] [SPEAKER_01]: situations where like, oh, my God, like this person actually knows my ex or
[00:19:12.450] [SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, my God, this person knows half of my friend group.
[00:19:16.150] [SPEAKER_01]: They have this context of me already.
[00:19:20.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[00:19:21.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys like going to relationships and stuff as like a fresh, clean slate?
[00:19:26.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. You only know me through the context of us dating and nothing else.
[00:19:30.310] [SPEAKER_03]: For me, yes.
[00:19:31.470] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm probably the opposite.
[00:19:33.730] [SPEAKER_03]: So for me, if I found out that this
[00:19:35.650] [SPEAKER_03]: new person I'm dating has a bunch of mutuals and stuff,
[00:19:37.850] [SPEAKER_03]: that would totally be a green flag.
[00:19:40.050] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, we run in the same circles.
[00:19:41.770] [SPEAKER_03]: But like you said, it gets messy sometimes.
[00:19:45.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Living in the nuance is very fun.
[00:19:47.510] [SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[00:19:49.410] [SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm probably more on Jesus side.
[00:19:52.270] [SPEAKER_00]: We're like, when I go on hinge dates or even when I meet a new person that has
[00:19:56.290] [SPEAKER_00]: no connections with it's like it's really hard to take what they say at
[00:20:00.150] [SPEAKER_00]: their word ever because you just don't know.
[00:20:04.070] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. But like at least the friend, it's like it's kind of vetted.
[00:20:07.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And then yeah.
[00:20:08.190] [SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much more tea that comes if you guys actually date.
[00:20:11.250] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, so you have something to tell and they can actually provide context
[00:20:14.870] [SPEAKER_00]: and shit. It's amazing.
[00:20:16.450] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's true.
[00:20:17.550] [SPEAKER_01]: They have like another perspective of like the current goss.
[00:20:22.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:20:23.310] [SPEAKER_00]: If all you live for is the goss, this is like the best way to do it.
[00:20:26.550] [SPEAKER_00]: Make the wire super cross and complicated.
[00:20:29.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess I just like the idea of getting
[00:20:32.550] [SPEAKER_01]: to know someone kind of brand new versus hearing about this person
[00:20:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: from everyone else. Like, oh, you're dating this person.
[00:20:41.510] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I went to high school with them and then they start sharing
[00:20:44.250] [SPEAKER_01]: all these stories and I'm like, OK, well, I don't know if I necessarily
[00:20:47.150] [SPEAKER_01]: wanted their character to be colored by that before I got to know them.
[00:20:52.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I do.
[00:20:54.370] [SPEAKER_00]: It makes it so much more fun.
[00:20:57.950] [SPEAKER_03]: I think to be fair, I'm also like a friend data.
[00:21:00.730] [SPEAKER_03]: So then it wouldn't be like a stranger to me.
[00:21:02.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, I probably would have known these people and friends already.
[00:21:06.210] [SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it wouldn't be that big
[00:21:08.650] [SPEAKER_03]: of a difference to hear about this person because we would already have
[00:21:12.350] [SPEAKER_03]: some sort of established relationship already.
[00:21:15.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Right. That's fair.
[00:21:16.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess mine also goes hand in hand with the fact that I'm not a friend data.
[00:21:20.950] [SPEAKER_01]: You're a stranger data.
[00:21:25.390] [SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't roll off the tongue as easily.
[00:21:28.130] [SPEAKER_00]: It sounds a little sus, but you do you.
[00:21:32.650] [SPEAKER_01]: I do have another sticky situation question for you all.
[00:21:36.630] [SPEAKER_01]: If you met someone who you know is
[00:21:40.450] [SPEAKER_01]: acquainted with your ex, would you acknowledge that?
[00:21:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]: So like a friend of an ex?
[00:21:46.390] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. So let's say like you've met this person before at like a party or
[00:21:51.050] [SPEAKER_01]: something and then now you're meeting them again at another party.
[00:21:55.350] [SPEAKER_01]: And they are you know, they're like friends with your ex.
[00:21:58.130] [SPEAKER_01]: Would you acknowledge that connection or just pretend you've never met them before?
[00:22:02.390] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is where earlier I was
[00:22:04.310] [SPEAKER_00]: saying, like, oh, like I want to appear like the bigger person, whatever I am.
[00:22:08.970] [SPEAKER_00]: Actually doesn't fucking matter.
[00:22:09.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I want to appear like I got my shit together and stuff.
[00:22:12.430] [SPEAKER_00]: This is where it like ultimately matters.
[00:22:15.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Like in front of the friends, I like because I know what's going to happen.
[00:22:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, oh, my God, I ran to like this.
[00:22:20.030] [SPEAKER_00]: I ran to Eugene. He was being so weird.
[00:22:24.230] [SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm going to go up there.
[00:22:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I know people.
[00:22:27.470] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm tapping people up.
[00:22:29.090] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm being super chill.
[00:22:30.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I see you. Hey, long time no see.
[00:22:32.790] [SPEAKER_00]: How have you been? Right.
[00:22:35.610] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. And what can they do if they're weird?
[00:22:37.290] [SPEAKER_00]: Then, hey, I got shit to tell my people.
[00:22:39.530] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. It's a win win to be chill.
[00:22:43.030] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's also like, I mean, I assume
[00:22:45.070] [SPEAKER_00]: you have no weird feelings about your ex's friend.
[00:22:48.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. So I don't think it's that hard to act normal unless you did some
[00:22:52.210] [SPEAKER_00]: weird shit with your ex and then you know that they know it.
[00:22:55.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But that's like your problem.
[00:22:57.370] [SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't do that.
[00:22:59.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I don't know.
[00:23:00.110] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm like chronically on chill, unfortunately.
[00:23:02.830] [SPEAKER_03]: Chronically on chill is a crazy thing.
[00:23:05.150] [SPEAKER_02]: That's so insane.
[00:23:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know me.
[00:23:09.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Like if I could be like Eugene, I would.
[00:23:12.870] [SPEAKER_03]: But if this person I only like kind of know, I would probably just reintroduce
[00:23:17.470] [SPEAKER_03]: myself and I'll be super friendly and I won't be weird.
[00:23:19.670] [SPEAKER_03]: I won't be like standoffish.
[00:23:21.010] [SPEAKER_03]: I'll just be like, hi, I'm Jisoo.
[00:23:22.930] [SPEAKER_03]: Nice to meet you. And like fresh slate.
[00:23:24.990] [SPEAKER_03]: And maybe later in the night things loosen up a little bit.
[00:23:28.510] [SPEAKER_03]: I might mention the ex, but probably wouldn't.
[00:23:32.470] [SPEAKER_00]: So would you pretend that like the ex didn't exist?
[00:23:35.370] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe.
[00:23:38.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Just wipe them from then.
[00:23:40.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we went to like, yeah, I met you through like, who fucking knows anyways.
[00:23:45.750] [SPEAKER_01]: No, because, yeah, I'm I'm worried sometimes that it's like,
[00:23:49.830] [SPEAKER_01]: what if they go back and they're hanging out with, you know, whoever?
[00:23:53.350] [SPEAKER_01]: They're like, dude, that was weird.
[00:23:55.010] [SPEAKER_01]: Crystal just like doesn't remember me,
[00:23:56.910] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess, when we obviously met like a handful of times before.
[00:24:01.570] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, I guess I'm assuming that this is someone who I've maybe like met once and
[00:24:05.850] [SPEAKER_03]: had minimal interactions with, but I just know that they're like an ex's friend.
[00:24:09.510] [SPEAKER_03]: If we had been like somewhat friends or even acquaintances,
[00:24:13.970] [SPEAKER_03]: I would probably say something like, oh, it's been so long since I've seen you
[00:24:18.210] [SPEAKER_03]: and like allude to the fact that it's because of the breakup or whatever.
[00:24:23.610] [SPEAKER_03]: That's fair. That's fair.
[00:24:24.450] [SPEAKER_01]: I've been in a situation where I've met someone who knows my boyfriend's ex.
[00:24:31.290] [SPEAKER_01]: They were meeting for the first time,
[00:24:33.170] [SPEAKER_01]: like my boyfriend and that person were meeting for the first time in probably
[00:24:36.190] [SPEAKER_01]: like 10 years, and I was like, dude, does this girl like remember you?
[00:24:40.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Does she know you?
[00:24:41.550] [SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, I don't know.
[00:24:42.690] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we met once or twice, like in passing.
[00:24:46.070] [SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what are you going to do?
[00:24:47.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you going to acknowledge this or like say hi?
[00:24:50.770] [SPEAKER_01]: It was weird going into it.
[00:24:52.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I was definitely overthinking it a lot.
[00:24:53.930] [SPEAKER_01]: And I was excited to spectate what would happen.
[00:24:57.990] [SPEAKER_01]: Audience mode.
[00:24:59.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's the worst thing that can happen from like you see like your ex
[00:25:02.990] [SPEAKER_00]: is like acquaintance such friend and you decide to say something like what's
[00:25:06.450] [SPEAKER_00]: the worst case scenario that I would like to track you from wanting to do anything?
[00:25:10.970] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like I can instantly think of one thing.
[00:25:13.390] [SPEAKER_03]: For example, they're like, oh, I didn't even realize that you were
[00:25:17.550] [SPEAKER_03]: this person's ex or whatever, like maybe they like really don't know.
[00:25:20.450] [SPEAKER_03]: And then now there's like this whole story and you're like,
[00:25:22.650] [SPEAKER_03]: like, should I dive into it or whatever?
[00:25:25.830] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess like another would be what if they actually like hate you?
[00:25:30.290] [SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, my God.
[00:25:31.330] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is this person doing here?
[00:25:33.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, but bigger person, right?
[00:25:35.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't hate them.
[00:25:36.370] [SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't do anything wrong, that is true.
[00:25:38.570] [SPEAKER_00]: That is true. They shouldn't hate you.
[00:25:40.550] [SPEAKER_00]: Unless your ex was the one that was like stoking the hands.
[00:25:43.050] [SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's like you're so
[00:25:45.210] [SPEAKER_00]: unbothered and chill that they're just hating you for no reason.
[00:25:48.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You're just having fun and they're being like weird and glaring at you.
[00:25:51.850] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, what was up with that? Right.
[00:25:53.650] [SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.
[00:25:54.750] [SPEAKER_01]: I think these are probably more manageable when you know your breakup is like a
[00:26:00.410] [SPEAKER_01]: pretty mature one and like one that didn't cause any crazy rifts.
[00:26:06.630] [SPEAKER_01]: But if you had like kind of a bad
[00:26:08.890] [SPEAKER_01]: breakup where people end up really hating each other, then it's kind of more
[00:26:12.990] [SPEAKER_01]: scary to think about like, oh, my God, should I be interacting with this
[00:26:16.490] [SPEAKER_01]: person's friends when they obviously hate me?
[00:26:20.010] [SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever had to meet your ex's ex?
[00:26:25.210] [SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[00:26:27.470] [SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never.
[00:26:29.430] [SPEAKER_01]: I personally have not, but I have had an ex meet one of my exes when we were dating.
[00:26:37.050] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK. Yeah.
[00:26:38.030] [SPEAKER_00]: So so I am your ex in that situation.
[00:26:41.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Wait, no, wait.
[00:26:42.770] [SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:43.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Sorry. This got really confusing.
[00:26:45.470] [SPEAKER_00]: I was that I was I met my ex's ex once or not even once.
[00:26:51.710] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm currently living in this right now.
[00:26:54.670] [SPEAKER_00]: My ex's ex is friends with my friends.
[00:26:57.790] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so I see him at parties all the time now.
[00:27:01.530] [SPEAKER_00]: And like I've heard about this guy for
[00:27:03.350] [SPEAKER_00]: so long and heard so much shit like all this stuff.
[00:27:07.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, it does one thing when I'm
[00:27:08.630] [SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, my gosh, she's going to talk about me the same way.
[00:27:11.210] [SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy because he's pretty chill, honestly.
[00:27:12.970] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, you're not exactly what my ex said.
[00:27:17.530] [SPEAKER_00]: So now I know that that's fine.
[00:27:20.030] [SPEAKER_00]: But it's also really fun to like, I like we'll just be like, hey,
[00:27:25.210] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah, how do I know you again? Oh, that's right.
[00:27:27.350] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:27:28.030] [SPEAKER_00]: And just make it uncomfortable.
[00:27:29.670] [SPEAKER_00]: One time I took a picture with him at a party and I was like,
[00:27:31.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send this to my ex if you like don't drink.
[00:27:33.690] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[00:27:34.870] [SPEAKER_03]: Wait, that's so. Wait, did you actually send it?
[00:27:37.370] [SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[00:27:38.710] [SPEAKER_00]: I do have the picture, though.
[00:27:39.970] [SPEAKER_00]: It is a crazy picture.
[00:27:40.890] [SPEAKER_00]: It also you know what it does,
[00:27:42.550] [SPEAKER_00]: it also makes you look at yourself and be like, wow, I am a type.
[00:27:47.130] [SPEAKER_00]: I am a subset of a personality that because I see this guy and I'm like,
[00:27:53.350] [SPEAKER_00]: I see it, I see it.
[00:27:55.210] [SPEAKER_00]: We're both like the same height.
[00:27:56.690] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, all right.
[00:27:57.870] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's so funny, honestly.
[00:28:00.770] [SPEAKER_03]: And OK, do you like have you ever
[00:28:02.970] [SPEAKER_03]: talked about your ex with this guy like, oh, did she do this and this?
[00:28:07.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[00:28:08.110] [SPEAKER_00]: Not like specific things, but we would like
[00:28:11.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I think we're both respectable enough to not be like, oh, we're not airing shit
[00:28:15.170] [SPEAKER_00]: out, right, but then like something would happen and then it would be related
[00:28:19.570] [SPEAKER_00]: to like my ex and then I give him a look.
[00:28:22.310] [SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, yeah, I know, right?
[00:28:25.450] [SPEAKER_00]: That's all we need to say.
[00:28:26.990] [SPEAKER_00]: That's it. Move on.
[00:28:28.450] [SPEAKER_03]: This is wild.
[00:28:29.670] [SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like new nightmare unlocked.
[00:28:32.990] [SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny, though.
[00:28:34.130] [SPEAKER_00]: It's really funny.
[00:28:35.210] [SPEAKER_00]: You should experience it once if you never have.
[00:28:37.170] [SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[00:28:38.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you're both exes, it can be funny and like you can bond over it.
[00:28:43.050] [SPEAKER_01]: But if like someone is currently dating
[00:28:44.890] [SPEAKER_01]: that person and the other person's an ex, then it might be a little awkward.
[00:28:49.510] [SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[00:28:50.610] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's why you just have to just pull out the bigger person
[00:28:53.510] [SPEAKER_00]: thing again, where it's like no matter what you've heard about me or
[00:28:58.090] [SPEAKER_00]: or like how I may appear or whatever, I'm going to be a normal person.
[00:29:02.430] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's up to you to be the weird one.
[00:29:04.630] [SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, then like, hey, good luck with that.
[00:29:07.790] [SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[00:29:08.750] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I want to pivot a little bit
[00:29:11.450] [SPEAKER_03]: away from exes and more about how we handle situations in current relationships.
[00:29:18.610] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to introduce the perilla leaf situation to us all.
[00:29:22.750] [SPEAKER_03]: And for some context, this is like
[00:29:25.010] [SPEAKER_03]: a hypothetical situation that blew up in Korea as like kind of like a test
[00:29:29.410] [SPEAKER_03]: to see how different people react to the same type of like weird situation.
[00:29:35.090] [SPEAKER_03]: But perilla leaves are a banchan or like
[00:29:38.310] [SPEAKER_03]: a side dish that often comes out with Korean food.
[00:29:41.190] [SPEAKER_03]: And the interesting thing about it is it's really thin layers of leaves
[00:29:45.810] [SPEAKER_03]: and it's like all marinating in the sauce.
[00:29:48.710] [SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes if you want to just pick one up, it's not like a solo act.
[00:29:52.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you could be struggling and then you need someone else's set of
[00:29:55.510] [SPEAKER_03]: chopsticks to like hold down the other leaves so that you could just peel one.
[00:29:59.430] [SPEAKER_03]: So that's cultural context for you guys.
[00:30:02.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading a sub stack about this right now.
[00:30:04.270] Oh, my God.
[00:30:05.650] [SPEAKER_03]: A whole sub stack about it.
[00:30:08.310] [SPEAKER_03]: So say you are eating dinner with a group of friends and your SO is there
[00:30:13.610] [SPEAKER_03]: and across from you, someone is struggling to pick up some food.
[00:30:18.070] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you care if your SO helps that person and puts their chopsticks on
[00:30:22.390] [SPEAKER_03]: something to like help them peel off that leaf?
[00:30:25.490] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I wouldn't care too much, but it also kind of depends on like the follow
[00:30:31.150] [SPEAKER_01]: up. Is your SO really paying attention to this person?
[00:30:35.990] [SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they were doing that.
[00:30:37.890] [SPEAKER_01]: Or was it just an act of kindness?
[00:30:39.650] [SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, OK, whatever.
[00:30:42.630] [SPEAKER_03]: True. Like, why are you watching this person and what kind of panchan they're eating?
[00:30:46.890] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're like, OK, suddenly you're like,
[00:30:49.290] [SPEAKER_01]: moving all the panchan to them and like giving them napkins and chopsticks and stuff.
[00:30:54.530] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's going on?
[00:30:55.670] [SPEAKER_00]: But what if they're really good friends
[00:30:57.130] [SPEAKER_00]: and your SO is just a really attentive and nice person?
[00:31:01.290] [SPEAKER_01]: Then it matters situationally.
[00:31:03.110] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you are caring for this person more than you're caring for me when I
[00:31:08.690] [SPEAKER_01]: should be your priority.
[00:31:10.530] [SPEAKER_01]: Then that's where it's like, OK, it's starting to feel a little weird.
[00:31:15.510] [SPEAKER_01]: But if it's just normal friendly behavior,
[00:31:17.730] [SPEAKER_01]: then I think it's like very understandable.
[00:31:20.430] [SPEAKER_01]: True.
[00:31:21.450] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm in a similar situation where it would probably depend on how secure I
[00:31:27.170] [SPEAKER_03]: feel in this relationship and like how my SO normally is.
[00:31:31.330] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think I would also feel like, OK, there's all these people at this
[00:31:36.090] [SPEAKER_03]: dinner table and of all of us, you're the one who has to put your
[00:31:40.470] [SPEAKER_03]: chopsticks out for this girl to like pick up her leaf.
[00:31:43.330] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, how come the other nine people at this table aren't doing anything?
[00:31:47.450] [SPEAKER_01]: Hey, man, one person's like across diagonally.
[00:31:50.490] [SPEAKER_01]: They can't reach.
[00:31:51.590] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, then walk over.
[00:31:55.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what?
[00:31:56.930] [SPEAKER_00]: That's why you date him.
[00:31:57.870] [SPEAKER_00]: He's the one with initiative, right?
[00:32:00.950] [SPEAKER_00]: You date a man that knows what he wants.
[00:32:03.430] [SPEAKER_01]: I think the ideal situation here is like another girlfriend would help.
[00:32:07.410] [SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[00:32:07.910] [SPEAKER_03]: True, true.
[00:32:09.390] [SPEAKER_03]: Or it's like you see your SO's chopsticks going,
[00:32:12.510] [SPEAKER_03]: you like smack them out of the way and you put yours there.
[00:32:16.690] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I can be chivalrous too.
[00:32:20.190] [SPEAKER_00]: What if he uses the back of his chopstick respectfully?
[00:32:24.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, it's still it's the action that matters, right?
[00:32:27.890] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:29.430] [SPEAKER_00]: Ask some questions about the situation.
[00:32:31.670] [SPEAKER_00]: So so OK, for a girl or like the opposite,
[00:32:36.550] [SPEAKER_00]: same sexual preference as what your SO is into.
[00:32:42.150] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:32:42.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if it's a dude, if it's a straight guy and a straight guy,
[00:32:45.090] [SPEAKER_00]: it's like whatever.
[00:32:47.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:48.090] [SPEAKER_00]: OK. And also what if he does this for maybe not every girl, but like enough
[00:32:53.450] [SPEAKER_00]: or like it's like he just does it all the time.
[00:32:57.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:59.110] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[00:33:00.210] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like then why are you the perilla man?
[00:33:02.290] [SPEAKER_03]: Like just eat your own meal.
[00:33:03.950] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.
[00:33:06.930] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, give the other single people a chance to help that person.
[00:33:14.270] [SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[00:33:15.890] [SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a situation that happened to me once that kind of bothered me.
[00:33:19.930] [SPEAKER_01]: We were eating at a restaurant and there's a certain side dish that I really like.
[00:33:25.010] [SPEAKER_01]: And then my boyfriend at the time was like, oh, my God,
[00:33:29.830] [SPEAKER_01]: you really like this side dish and pushed it towards another girl.
[00:33:34.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you were going to say to you,
[00:33:38.030] [SPEAKER_03]: that's not OK.
[00:33:40.010] [SPEAKER_00]: I would fail all of your tests if we ever ate Korean food together.
[00:33:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[00:33:45.950] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've never considered these things.
[00:33:48.630] [SPEAKER_03]: I think the logic is kind of like, do I want to date a nice man?
[00:33:52.870] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.
[00:33:54.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Manners and being polite are super important.
[00:33:56.670] [SPEAKER_03]: But you don't want to date like someone who's nice to everyone equally.
[00:34:00.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Then it's like, am I even special or are you literally the perilla man?
[00:34:04.590] [SPEAKER_00]: I get what you mean.
[00:34:06.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I get what you mean.
[00:34:07.950] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like, why is this other person on the top of the list when I
[00:34:12.950] [SPEAKER_01]: have this preference that you should know?
[00:34:15.370] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[00:34:17.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. OK.
[00:34:19.090] [SPEAKER_01]: Eugene's like, what if all his relationships?
[00:34:23.030] [SPEAKER_00]: No. OK. OK. Because OK, and GSU probably knows this better.
[00:34:25.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of my close friends are girls.
[00:34:28.550] [SPEAKER_00]: And these are people I've known for like a long time.
[00:34:30.470] [SPEAKER_03]: Right. Right.
[00:34:32.110] [SPEAKER_00]: So if I was in this situation,
[00:34:35.130] [SPEAKER_00]: I would be like, oh, yeah, of course I know what you want.
[00:34:36.890] [SPEAKER_00]: I've fucking known you for 10 years.
[00:34:38.650] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that type of thing.
[00:34:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about it with my
[00:34:43.510] [SPEAKER_00]: girl space friends too, like these situations.
[00:34:45.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I totally get the idea that, oh, you want to feel special.
[00:34:50.590] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. So it's like if you're being
[00:34:51.870] [SPEAKER_00]: the same way to everyone, especially everyone, in my case, to all the girls
[00:34:56.250] [SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, it's like that is it's not like that.
[00:34:59.610] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not weird.
[00:35:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]: The weird part is you're not being extra something to your SO.
[00:35:04.130] [SPEAKER_00]: I totally get that.
[00:35:05.910] [SPEAKER_00]: But it's also like if I've been dating
[00:35:08.270] [SPEAKER_00]: someone for less than a year and they're expecting me to not treat
[00:35:12.930] [SPEAKER_00]: my friends more specially that I've known for 10 years,
[00:35:16.610] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm like, you know, they're like I've known them for 10 years
[00:35:20.870] [SPEAKER_00]: in a way. Right.
[00:35:22.210] [SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I don't feel great if I have to drop my level of comfort
[00:35:26.550] [SPEAKER_00]: with my friends so that the level of my SO is higher.
[00:35:30.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Like it has to be earned in the same way.
[00:35:32.970] [SPEAKER_03]: I think I think that's fair.
[00:35:36.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, big disagreement.
[00:35:38.250] [SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fair.
[00:35:39.570] [SPEAKER_03]: And I think people have different comfort levels.
[00:35:42.610] [SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine like the types of girls
[00:35:45.010] [SPEAKER_03]: that you date would be people who are more comfortable with stuff like that.
[00:35:48.950] [SPEAKER_03]: Like for me personally, I fully acknowledge you.
[00:35:53.110] [SPEAKER_03]: Like I can be a little petty and I can be jealous.
[00:35:55.670] [SPEAKER_03]: So then I feel like I need someone who can make me feel secure and maybe
[00:36:00.870] [SPEAKER_03]: avoid some of these situations where I'm like, oh, I don't feel super comfortable
[00:36:04.130] [SPEAKER_01]: with that. But then if this was like reversed for you, Eugene,
[00:36:08.230] [SPEAKER_01]: like what if you're dating someone and then this girl is constantly dropping you
[00:36:12.110] [SPEAKER_01]: to go hang out with her guy friends who she's been friends with like for 10
[00:36:15.830] [SPEAKER_01]: years, you would be OK with that?
[00:36:18.570] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:36:20.470] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, like, like, I mean, if she's like backing out of our hangout,
[00:36:24.450] [SPEAKER_00]: staying out with them, then that's fucked up.
[00:36:25.950] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, like if there's a pie chart
[00:36:27.850] [SPEAKER_00]: of her priorities and her priority with with hang out with her lifelong friends
[00:36:32.950] [SPEAKER_00]: or like people that she trusts and cares about is this big,
[00:36:36.090] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect to take a big part of that pie chart until I'm also at that
[00:36:41.310] [SPEAKER_00]: level with her, which is like who knows how long that takes.
[00:36:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]: But I guess I feel like the whole being nice to everyone thing,
[00:36:48.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there is a way to treat someone special.
[00:36:53.470] [SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, but it doesn't have to come at the expense of your other friends.
[00:36:58.610] [SPEAKER_01]: You know? Yeah.
[00:37:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm aware of that.
[00:37:02.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Like this is getting too deep into it.
[00:37:03.650] [SPEAKER_00]: But you know how a lot of people say it's like, oh, you're like girlfriend
[00:37:06.270] [SPEAKER_00]: and boyfriend should be like your best friend type of thing.
[00:37:08.850] [SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, but if your best friend was like the person of the opposite
[00:37:12.150] [SPEAKER_00]: gender, the way you treat them is low key similar to how you would treat
[00:37:15.430] [SPEAKER_00]: yourself, I think to some extent, right?
[00:37:19.030] [SPEAKER_00]: Just because how much you care about each other.
[00:37:21.010] [SPEAKER_00]: There's like an extra layer, though.
[00:37:22.450] [SPEAKER_00]: That's like you only do the SO.
[00:37:24.090] [SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part where I think is stuff like,
[00:37:28.130] [SPEAKER_00]: dude, it's even hard to say right now.
[00:37:29.070] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like, you know, there's some things
[00:37:31.390] [SPEAKER_00]: as friends you guys just won't touch because there's a level of personal
[00:37:36.950] [SPEAKER_00]: privacy or space and that's where you can show that's your SO, I think.
[00:37:40.810] [SPEAKER_00]: But if we're just eating fucking perilla leaves,
[00:37:44.750] [SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I'll do this for everyone I care about.
[00:37:47.530] [SPEAKER_00]: So like I'll include my SO into this.
[00:37:50.150] [SPEAKER_00]: I will also do this for you.
[00:37:51.670] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, it's weird if you do it for your friends, but not your SO.
[00:37:55.590] [SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[00:37:57.370] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I get what you're saying.
[00:37:58.690] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I will continue to treat my friends well,
[00:38:01.530] [SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not going to like lower them just because I'm dating someone.
[00:38:06.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Yeah.
[00:38:07.710] [SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean that you're mistreating the person you're dating.
[00:38:11.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:13.850] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, I feel like it's also a little bit hard to conceptualize this because
[00:38:17.990] [SPEAKER_03]: it's not like we're eating perilla leaves super often.
[00:38:20.850] [SPEAKER_03]: So let me try to convert this into a more common situation that we might run into.
[00:38:26.090] [SPEAKER_03]: So say you're at like an outdoor thing,
[00:38:28.310] [SPEAKER_03]: like outdoor dinner or maybe like an outdoor party or something.
[00:38:31.570] [SPEAKER_03]: And it's getting a little cold.
[00:38:34.430] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you feel OK with your SO lending their jacket to another girl or,
[00:38:39.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess, vice versa of like your SO wearing another guy's jacket?
[00:38:43.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[00:38:46.990] [SPEAKER_00]: Generally, generally, yes.
[00:38:49.070] [SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how cold each person is.
[00:38:52.830] [SPEAKER_00]: But also, traditionally, girls don't give guys jackets as much.
[00:38:56.710] [SPEAKER_00]: So I only know about from like me giving a jacket to someone
[00:38:59.770] [SPEAKER_00]: or like a guy friend giving a jacket to my SO.
[00:39:02.270] [SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is fine.
[00:39:03.830] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, as long as they're still either the same or more care for the SO in those cases.
[00:39:10.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not mistreating or neglecting my SO.
[00:39:14.370] [SPEAKER_00]: As long as that's happening, that's fine.
[00:39:16.050] [SPEAKER_00]: I have had an instance where I gave my jacket to a friend and then the SO didn't.
[00:39:22.270] [SPEAKER_00]: The friend's SO didn't.
[00:39:23.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Her boyfriend didn't give.
[00:39:25.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And because he didn't realize she was cold.
[00:39:28.290] [SPEAKER_00]: But I did because we've been friends for a long time.
[00:39:30.910] [SPEAKER_00]: All right. OK, I can sense that shit.
[00:39:33.410] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, she was shivering.
[00:39:34.910] [SPEAKER_01]: What if you just told her SO, hey, maybe you should give her your jacket?
[00:39:38.710] [SPEAKER_01]: She looks cool.
[00:39:39.090] [SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the guy brain comes in, right?
[00:39:41.530] [SPEAKER_00]: All right. So yes, what I did,
[00:39:43.690] [SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was kind of weird because afterwards the guy was like apologizing to me.
[00:39:48.870] [SPEAKER_00]: He was like, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:39:50.870] [SPEAKER_00]: I should have done that, you know?
[00:39:52.790] [SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, I've known her for so much longer than you.
[00:39:55.910] [SPEAKER_00]: And also, like, it's chill.
[00:39:57.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm happy for you guys.
[00:39:58.810] [SPEAKER_00]: You guys are great. Just cute together.
[00:40:00.890] [SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a big deal, right?
[00:40:02.650] [SPEAKER_00]: But I thought about I think if I was like, hey, you should give her your jacket.
[00:40:07.930] [SPEAKER_00]: That's I think maybe among girls that would be more like that,
[00:40:11.510] [SPEAKER_00]: like girl code, that would be a bit more understandable.
[00:40:15.750] [SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like among guy code, it'd be like, bro,
[00:40:18.070] [SPEAKER_00]: why are you telling me how to do my relationship?
[00:40:20.350] [SPEAKER_01]: Like they get defensive about it.
[00:40:22.410] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Like, why are you telling me how to be a boyfriend?
[00:40:24.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. It's like, I'm not asking for advice.
[00:40:26.490] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, let me do my thing.
[00:40:27.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one is better.
[00:40:28.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But the way I thought about it was like, OK, I'm just like I did it so
[00:40:31.650] [SPEAKER_00]: quickly and without thinking that like it's hard.
[00:40:34.270] [SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for it to seem like I was doing it with intention.
[00:40:36.990] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I see.
[00:40:38.530] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I have a solution, potential solution.
[00:40:40.910] [SPEAKER_01]: You just ask really loudly, oh my God, are you cold?
[00:40:46.230] [SPEAKER_00]: That's actually so genius.
[00:40:48.290] [SPEAKER_00]: That's so smart.
[00:40:51.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I totally get what you mean, though.
[00:40:52.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes it can come off as a oh, yeah, like what are you?
[00:40:55.290] [SPEAKER_01]: Why are you trying to tell me what to do?
[00:40:57.750] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, dude. I think it's like a little weird.
[00:41:00.590] [SPEAKER_03]: It goes back to the whole thing of like of all the people here.
[00:41:04.350] [SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to be the one to give up your job.
[00:41:06.810] [SPEAKER_01]: And now you're the jacket man.
[00:41:08.650] I know exactly.
[00:41:10.470] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, why am I getting fucking Mr.
[00:41:12.050] [SPEAKER_03]: Jacket over here? And the thing is, if it was truly like really
[00:41:15.770] [SPEAKER_03]: freezing and this girl was like unwell showing signs of hypothermia.
[00:41:20.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course, I'm not being like, oh, like you still can't give the jacket.
[00:41:24.170] [SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, there's other jackets out there.
[00:41:28.190] [SPEAKER_03]: So if I could choose,
[00:41:31.270] [SPEAKER_03]: like if I could choose, I would prefer it to not be my SO's jacket.
[00:41:34.990] [SPEAKER_03]: But if it has to be, then so be it.
[00:41:37.150] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, question.
[00:41:38.650] [SPEAKER_00]: Would you be equally or similarly bothered if your SO gave his jacket to someone,
[00:41:46.310] [SPEAKER_00]: but you weren't there?
[00:41:48.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[00:41:50.150] [SPEAKER_03]: But how did I find out about it?
[00:41:52.730] [SPEAKER_00]: Like, OK, for example, a picture, a picture,
[00:41:55.590] [SPEAKER_00]: a picture or like I live near a concert venue.
[00:41:58.650] [SPEAKER_00]: So when my friends go to the concert venue, sometimes I walk them back
[00:42:02.090] [SPEAKER_00]: and I'll bring a jacket for them.
[00:42:05.110] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, if I was dating someone, I would still do the same thing.
[00:42:07.430] [SPEAKER_00]: But that's like, is that equally as like, oh, why are you doing that?
[00:42:11.150] [SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[00:42:12.510] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it almost depends on my mood, because sometimes I'm like,
[00:42:15.390] [SPEAKER_03]: oh, it's going to be cold.
[00:42:16.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Like we should bring all our jackets and make sure everyone's warm or whatever.
[00:42:19.550] [SPEAKER_03]: But other times, like I just don't think I have the capacity to be OK with that.
[00:42:24.210] [SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe it's just like how I feel.
[00:42:27.350] [SPEAKER_01]: At least you know yourself.
[00:42:30.070] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, what if it was like this?
[00:42:31.890] [SPEAKER_01]: We were like at your house, Jisoo.
[00:42:33.850] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah. And then like no one brought
[00:42:35.770] [SPEAKER_01]: jackets. And so now you're just handing out jackets from your closet.
[00:42:40.410] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, if it's like a bulk like jacket donation, I think it's fine.
[00:42:45.370] [SPEAKER_03]: But then why would she not wear my jacket?
[00:42:49.190] [SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[00:42:51.090] [SPEAKER_01]: Like my clothes are here too.
[00:42:52.390] [SPEAKER_01]: How about both of them are getting handed out?
[00:42:54.910] [SPEAKER_01]: Like your clothes and Jisoo.
[00:42:57.330] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, we all know this.
[00:42:59.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Like boyfriend hoodies hit different though.
[00:43:02.310] [SPEAKER_03]: See, exactly.
[00:43:03.630] [SPEAKER_03]: It's a boyfriend hoodie.
[00:43:04.630] [SPEAKER_03]: There's like meaning behind it, you know?
[00:43:07.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Or just comfort and practicality.
[00:43:08.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But yes, there's also meaning behind it.
[00:43:10.330] [SPEAKER_03]: No, dude, it's never a guy friend hoodie.
[00:43:12.530] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like boyfriend hoodie.
[00:43:13.930] [SPEAKER_00]: I give all my girl space friends my hoodies.
[00:43:17.590] [SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.
[00:43:19.250] [SPEAKER_03]: You're every boyfriend's public enemy number one.
[00:43:22.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I am a nightmare.
[00:43:23.970] [SPEAKER_00]: I am a problem.
[00:43:27.050] [SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like again, it's like the like again, back to the bigger person
[00:43:31.270] [SPEAKER_00]: thing, I don't ever do any such shit because I don't want to do any such shit.
[00:43:35.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:43:36.070] [SPEAKER_00]: And like there are like the boundaries where it's like my friend is dating
[00:43:40.350] [SPEAKER_00]: someone, she's not sleeping over ever.
[00:43:42.930] [SPEAKER_00]: If she was single, maybe she'd sleep over if it's convenient.
[00:43:45.450] [SPEAKER_00]: But like I am aware of the optics for those things.
[00:43:49.090] [SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to stuff like
[00:43:50.390] [SPEAKER_00]: the jacket stuff or the perilla leaf stuff, I feel like it's almost
[00:43:55.230] [SPEAKER_00]: better to normalize it to a certain extent.
[00:43:57.930] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[00:43:58.430] [SPEAKER_00]: It's also because I'm dealing with guys.
[00:43:59.510] [SPEAKER_00]: You guys are dealing with girls, right?
[00:44:02.310] [SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like for a guy, it's easier for the girl to be like
[00:44:05.410] [SPEAKER_00]: for my friend who is the girl to be like, hey, obviously nothing is
[00:44:09.510] [SPEAKER_00]: weird, you're being weird.
[00:44:10.270] [SPEAKER_00]: And the guy has to just take that.
[00:44:12.610] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[00:44:13.190] [SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like with the jacket thing,
[00:44:15.390] [SPEAKER_03]: I could give my jacket to her and then I could wear my SO's jacket.
[00:44:19.150] [SPEAKER_03]: Like there's like workarounds, you know what I mean?
[00:44:22.190] [SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.
[00:44:22.430] [SPEAKER_00]: But that's like an extra jacket pass.
[00:44:25.550] [SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[00:44:26.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is right.
[00:44:27.490] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying.
[00:44:28.290] [SPEAKER_00]: What if she was like 5'11", like hella tall and like your jacket doesn't fit her?
[00:44:32.930] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:44:34.630] [SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[00:44:35.410] [SPEAKER_01]: What if earlier in the night you're not cold yet?
[00:44:38.670] [SPEAKER_01]: So then your SO gives their jacket to someone else, but then you get cold.
[00:44:44.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you allowed to take the jacket back?
[00:44:47.030] [SPEAKER_00]: That is insane.
[00:44:48.970] [SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?
[00:44:49.590] [SPEAKER_03]: That's my man's jacket.
[00:44:51.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Can I get that back?
[00:44:53.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Your lease is up.
[00:44:56.010] [SPEAKER_03]: Jacket eviction.
[00:44:58.070] [SPEAKER_03]: See, this is why it's just better to not do this shit at all.
[00:45:01.510] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's too complicated.
[00:45:02.930] [SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm like mad at this hypothetical situation.
[00:45:07.010] Okay.
[00:45:07.630] [SPEAKER_01]: I think there should be a base here.
[00:45:09.590] [SPEAKER_01]: If you're the one to lend out the jacket or whatever, and your SO does not
[00:45:15.570] [SPEAKER_01]: have a jacket that night, then you should be prepared to lend it to them
[00:45:20.130] [SPEAKER_01]: over anyone else. Right?
[00:45:22.790] [SPEAKER_01]: But I guess if your SO already has a jacket and is prepared for that night,
[00:45:26.810] [SPEAKER_01]: then maybe it's slightly more okay to lend your jacket out.
[00:45:32.250] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a solution from the guy side, I guess, because I feel like this is
[00:45:37.250] [SPEAKER_00]: more of a guy can fuck up here, right?
[00:45:40.290] [SPEAKER_00]: You wear two jackets, one for the friend, one for the SO.
[00:45:45.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can layer up, look a little nice and stuff.
[00:45:47.670] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. But first jacket goes out, whoever needs it.
[00:45:51.230] [SPEAKER_00]: But you have an emergency jacket if your SO needs it.
[00:45:54.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:45:55.130] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually like the not as thick layer.
[00:45:58.610] [SPEAKER_00]: So you can also hug her and be like, oh, we're in this together type shit.
[00:46:02.030] [SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many ways to do this.
[00:46:03.590] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're just sweating all night, like bullets all night.
[00:46:08.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:46:09.230] [SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm trying to treat you right.
[00:46:13.670] [SPEAKER_00]: I sacrifice for you.
[00:46:16.390] [SPEAKER_01]: That one, I think is a little...
[00:46:19.490] [SPEAKER_01]: I don't know. Like you specifically planned for another girl?
[00:46:23.050] [SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:24.590] [SPEAKER_00]: You specifically planned. It could be a guy too.
[00:46:27.250] [SPEAKER_00]: I give my guy friends jackets.
[00:46:28.310] [SPEAKER_00]: They usually say no because like, you know, toxic masculinity.
[00:46:31.210] [SPEAKER_00]: But I offer still either way.
[00:46:34.210] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I think the idea here.
[00:46:36.470] [SPEAKER_01]: OK, I guess you're right.
[00:46:37.450] [SPEAKER_01]: It could be another guy.
[00:46:38.550] [SPEAKER_01]: But if it was like another girl,
[00:46:40.510] [SPEAKER_01]: it's the fact that they anticipated like giving away two jackets.
[00:46:46.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Counter, counter objection.
[00:46:48.810] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, if we're going out and it's
[00:46:50.130] [SPEAKER_00]: like a bunch of guys, a bunch of girls or whatever.
[00:46:52.050] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. Let's say I'm going out with my SO
[00:46:53.910] [SPEAKER_00]: and also like some of my girlfriends, girl space friends.
[00:46:57.170] [SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[00:46:57.810] [SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times girls go out.
[00:46:59.430] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. You want to look good.
[00:47:00.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't bring the extra layer.
[00:47:02.230] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's crazy to me to be like, oh, one of them might need a jacket.
[00:47:06.090] [SPEAKER_03]: Dude, but you're now literally Jacket Man.
[00:47:08.990] [SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?
[00:47:10.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And so what?
[00:47:12.750] [SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of jackets.
[00:47:14.310] [SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[00:47:15.270] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a better solution is you can tell your girl space friends.
[00:47:19.670] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you guys should bring a jacket.
[00:47:21.230] [SPEAKER_01]: I can carry them for you.
[00:47:23.350] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[00:47:24.370] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that.
[00:47:25.950] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, you already know I'm wearing two jackets.
[00:47:28.890] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, no.
[00:47:29.650] [SPEAKER_00]: It'll be like it'll be like a puffer and like a flannel.
[00:47:32.130] [SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it'll be like it'll look good.
[00:47:34.630] [SPEAKER_00]: It'll look natural.
[00:47:36.150] [SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's like to see you,
[00:47:37.550] [SPEAKER_01]: Gina's like I can do it for another girl, but suddenly all these girls know
[00:47:41.650] [SPEAKER_01]: like, well, I'll see the difference here.
[00:47:43.950] [SPEAKER_00]: I'll carry my own jacket, too.
[00:47:45.890] [SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to like be like, I think it's weird to be like, oh,
[00:47:48.490] [SPEAKER_00]: let me carry all the girls jackets.
[00:47:50.390] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me be the fucking basket for you to carry stuff in.
[00:47:54.070] [SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what you're volunteering to do without telling them by bringing
[00:47:58.450] [SPEAKER_00]: I am prepared for whatever.
[00:48:01.310] [SPEAKER_00]: I am preparing myself for anything that can happen.
[00:48:04.230] [SPEAKER_03]: But it's like I want my man to just be prepared for me at the end of the day.
[00:48:08.350] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm prepared for all my friends and also my SO, but also all my friends.
[00:48:14.330] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[00:48:14.710] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, back to the thing.
[00:48:15.990] [SPEAKER_00]: I was like, how if it's like my lifelong
[00:48:18.930] [SPEAKER_00]: friends, someone who I trust more than my SO, I don't feel good about like
[00:48:25.010] [SPEAKER_00]: preparing for my SO when if I was single, I would prepare for my friends.
[00:48:28.790] [SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense, I would try to have I would try to consider both at least.
[00:48:33.830] [SPEAKER_03]: I think it does make sense, but I feel like there is a line where
[00:48:36.630] [SPEAKER_03]: at a certain point you're like maybe potentially overstepping.
[00:48:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:48:41.670] [SPEAKER_03]: If your friend had an SO and he was
[00:48:44.470] [SPEAKER_03]: uncomfortable with that, like you would maybe stop.
[00:48:47.250] [SPEAKER_03]: Right. But what if it's like the same thing, but inverse,
[00:48:49.770] [SPEAKER_03]: like your SO might be uncomfortable with it.
[00:48:52.190] [SPEAKER_03]: Would you stop?
[00:48:53.890] [SPEAKER_00]: If my SO was uncomfortable with me giving out jackets?
[00:48:55.990] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:48:57.190] [SPEAKER_00]: Like in that situation. OK, let me sorry.
[00:48:58.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Let me be clear. I've never done this.
[00:49:01.310] [SPEAKER_00]: Like I never do.
[00:49:02.170] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe you.
[00:49:03.130] [SPEAKER_00]: OK, I do.
[00:49:05.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Plans in action.
[00:49:06.990] [SPEAKER_00]: No, OK.
[00:49:07.950] [SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have like the the concert situation, right?
[00:49:10.870] [SPEAKER_00]: Like if I'm walking two girl space friends home, then I'll bring out where
[00:49:14.790] [SPEAKER_00]: double jackets in case they both want a jacket.
[00:49:17.310] [SPEAKER_00]: But I've never had a case where I had to like choose between my SL and my
[00:49:20.110] [SPEAKER_03]: friends. Oh, I see.
[00:49:22.190] [SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't prepare that.
[00:49:24.590] [SPEAKER_00]: But but I think points still stands to an extent.
[00:49:29.110] [SPEAKER_00]: I just think that like there is a way to how do I say there?
[00:49:33.190] [SPEAKER_00]: There has to be some way to look out for your friends or like if your
[00:49:38.110] [SPEAKER_00]: friend needs something like a jacket, you can be able to offer it.
[00:49:42.850] [SPEAKER_00]: But not in a way that's like you're doing it because your SO isn't like there's
[00:49:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]: all factors. Right.
[00:49:48.590] [SPEAKER_00]: Again, if all your friends are going out and like, you know, we're all going
[00:49:51.990] [SPEAKER_00]: to be cold than like I will be prepared to get my SO my jacket.
[00:49:57.490] [SPEAKER_00]: I will also prepare potentially for one of my friends.
[00:50:00.090] [SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, I'm not going to neglect my SO.
[00:50:04.230] [SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[00:50:04.670] [SPEAKER_03]: Jesus doesn't. Am I the bad guy here?
[00:50:07.950] [SPEAKER_03]: It's like two sides of the jacket spectrum.
[00:50:11.190] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I think ultimately, though, it's just that like you probably want to be
[00:50:16.910] [SPEAKER_01]: more prepared for your SO, I guess, versus anyone else.
[00:50:21.730] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are you responsible for everyone else?
[00:50:25.130] [SPEAKER_00]: That is also true. Yes, I agree.
[00:50:27.050] [SPEAKER_01]: I guess like the best situation would be your SO notices some other girl is
[00:50:32.740] [SPEAKER_01]: cold and she's like, hey, you should lend her your jacket.
[00:50:35.880] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that happens a lot too, right?
[00:50:37.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's like very.
[00:50:39.100] [SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's like perfectly fine.
[00:50:42.840] [SPEAKER_00]: So is it worse if she doesn't say that and you do it without her?
[00:50:46.140] [SPEAKER_00]: Like what if she was just going to say it, but then you do it first?
[00:50:48.960] [SPEAKER_00]: Does that feel weird? Yeah.
[00:50:52.340] [SPEAKER_01]: The instant yes.
[00:50:55.610] [SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm just talking about preferences here.
[00:50:57.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying my guy would be like banned or restricted.
[00:51:00.790] [SPEAKER_03]: It's just like what I prefer for him to not always be like looking out
[00:51:06.090] [SPEAKER_03]: for the cold women in the crowd, like probably.
[00:51:08.690] [SPEAKER_00]: He respects women.
[00:51:09.950] [SPEAKER_00]: What a good guy.
[00:51:12.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I like that guy.
[00:51:14.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Bro's a walking thermometer.
[00:51:16.630] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, he's tapped in.
[00:51:19.170] [SPEAKER_01]: He's wearing five jackets for every girl in the group.
[00:51:22.430] [SPEAKER_00]: He got the ultra light down in his pockets, like, dude, he's ready.
[00:51:27.330] [SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Jesus, check these out.
[00:51:28.810] [SPEAKER_01]: I bought these zip up jackets for him.
[00:51:32.530] [SPEAKER_01]: His cargo pants are like filled.
[00:51:37.090] [SPEAKER_00]: What a prepared man.
[00:51:40.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think for me, like to wrap it all up, I am probably not super bothered
[00:51:45.930] [SPEAKER_01]: by it, but if like the jacket were to go out to someone else and I might need
[00:51:50.970] [SPEAKER_01]: it later, then that's like kind of a kind of a no.
[00:51:55.070] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah. And that's why you bring two jackets.
[00:51:59.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying.
[00:52:02.350] [SPEAKER_01]: All right, I have a final question for us all.
[00:52:05.270] [SPEAKER_01]: What is something that's maybe kind of specific or niche that you would consider
[00:52:10.770] [SPEAKER_01]: like towing the line, you know, something that's like not great behavior?
[00:52:16.090] [SPEAKER_00]: If my SO is doing something with someone else, like another guy that she doesn't
[00:52:23.190] [SPEAKER_00]: do with me, but it's like something that I like doing.
[00:52:27.450] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[00:52:29.790] [SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a concrete example, but like, I don't know, something similar has
[00:52:33.370] [SPEAKER_00]: happened before where it's like, oh, maybe like I like going to a certain type
[00:52:37.050] [SPEAKER_00]: of concert and she is like, oh, she's not into it.
[00:52:40.290] [SPEAKER_00]: So she doesn't go.
[00:52:41.170] [SPEAKER_00]: But she does go with someone else.
[00:52:42.890] [SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I thought you weren't about that shit.
[00:52:45.430] [SPEAKER_00]: What happened? You know, that's a good one.
[00:52:48.430] [SPEAKER_01]: Mine's kind of more generic.
[00:52:51.570] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if maybe you're at some social gathering or an event or whatever,
[00:52:58.810] [SPEAKER_01]: and then your SO is busy talking with someone else the whole time.
[00:53:03.670] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[00:53:06.530] [SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[00:53:06.730] [SPEAKER_03]: Mine is maybe kind of silly, but I think
[00:53:10.750] [SPEAKER_03]: if your SO is carpooling with someone a lot and it's just one on one
[00:53:15.070] [SPEAKER_03]: specifically, kind of sus.
[00:53:17.930] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[00:53:18.470] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is also very applicable
[00:53:20.310] [SPEAKER_01]: to you because I know you enjoy being passenger princess.
[00:53:24.350] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[00:53:25.950] [SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[00:53:27.810] [SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that?
[00:53:29.930] [SPEAKER_00]: How do you what do you mean you enjoy being passenger princess?
[00:53:34.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Like Jisoo prefers not to drive.
[00:53:37.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that it? Okay.
[00:53:38.450] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[00:53:39.010] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's like if her SO is specifically not driving Jisoo,
[00:53:43.950] [SPEAKER_01]: who is he? Like, why is he not driving Jisoo?
[00:53:45.870] [SPEAKER_01]: Like, why is someone else taking her spot?
[00:53:49.130] [SPEAKER_00]: Right. There's another passenger princess.
[00:53:51.050] [SPEAKER_00]: That's not you.
[00:53:52.130] [SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[00:53:53.010] [SPEAKER_03]: Why my passenger princess number one?
[00:53:55.430] [SPEAKER_03]: I should be like the only passenger princess.
[00:53:58.730] [SPEAKER_00]: What if wait, okay.
[00:53:59.790] [SPEAKER_00]: What if he is passenger princess to someone else a lot?
[00:54:05.730] [SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's fine.
[00:54:06.670] [SPEAKER_03]: But I think for the most part,
[00:54:09.350] [SPEAKER_03]: like, I would prefer to be carpooling with my SO.
[00:54:13.950] [SPEAKER_03]: So then if there's some situation where my SO is always carpooling with someone,
[00:54:21.010] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it would be a little weird.
[00:54:22.990] [SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait.
[00:54:23.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Also, I guess if your SO is being the passenger princess to someone else,
[00:54:28.750] [SPEAKER_01]: you should also be there.
[00:54:30.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[00:54:31.010] [SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck am I?
[00:54:33.590] [SPEAKER_00]: What if they care about the planet?
[00:54:36.850] [SPEAKER_00]: They are coworkers.
[00:54:38.690] [SPEAKER_00]: Hey, like HOV lane.
[00:54:40.090] [SPEAKER_00]: It is three plus now.
[00:54:41.850] [SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day when it wasn't three plus, right?
[00:54:45.010] [SPEAKER_01]: It's invalid now.
[00:54:47.210] [SPEAKER_00]: In 2009.
[00:54:48.270] [SPEAKER_00]: We're in 2009 right now.
[00:54:50.370] [SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[00:54:50.890] [SPEAKER_00]: And they go to work together and she drives them every day.
[00:54:55.250] [SPEAKER_03]: 2009, bro, we're 13.
[00:54:57.870] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[00:54:58.970] [SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[00:54:59.710] [SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[00:55:01.530] [SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no retort for that point.
[00:55:04.210] [SPEAKER_00]: That is really correct.
[00:55:06.170] [SPEAKER_03]: I feel like my learning from all of this is we all have very different
[00:55:11.190] [SPEAKER_03]: lines of what's okay and what's not.
[00:55:13.590] [SPEAKER_03]: So it was really funny for me to hear our various takes on the jacket stuff,
[00:55:18.290] [SPEAKER_03]: the perl leaf stuff and everything in between.
[00:55:22.150] [SPEAKER_01]: And I think ultimately, it's just that you have to communicate these boundaries
[00:55:25.670] [SPEAKER_01]: to your SO, so no matter your preference, as long as you both are
[00:55:30.270] [SPEAKER_01]: on the same page and it's been communicated, then there's definitely work around.
[00:55:35.830] [SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to buy less jackets.
[00:55:40.570] [SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Eugene, for coming on today to talk through all of these various
[00:55:44.970] [SPEAKER_03]: sticky situations for any of our listeners out there.
