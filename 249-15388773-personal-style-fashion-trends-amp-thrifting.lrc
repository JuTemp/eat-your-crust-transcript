[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Aileen. Welcome back, Aileen. The last episode Aileen was on with us was episode 182, the evolution of the parent permission. Dang, it's been a while. We're almost at 250 now. Wow, thanks for having me.
[00:00:34.080] But we brought Aileen on because we thought it would be fun to talk about personal style in our modern world of extremely fast-paced trends and lots of like fast fashion. And I feel like this is something that you're really interested in, fashion in general and curating your personal
[00:00:52.560] style. So we thought you would be the perfect guest to join us today. Yay, thanks. I'm really excited about this topic, actually. Dude, I love talking to fashionable people because I try, you know, like mentally, I try to keep up with what is going on in the world,
[00:01:08.560] what looks are trending and you know, what the latest hot new look is. But I feel like in terms of incorporating it into my closet, I just can't seem to keep up my purchases with like the latest
[00:01:21.360] trends. I always feel like I'm six months behind where I see something on Instagram and I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool. And then it takes me like six months to convince myself to buy it.
[00:01:30.800] And then when I buy it, it's like all of the things in that style are on clearance already, you know, like it's like over. And I'm always like, oh, like how do other people manage to
[00:01:39.440] keep up with what's the latest and greatest? I mean, I wouldn't say that I'm always keeping up immediately with every trend or hopping on every trend bandwagon. And I guess we'll talk about it on. But I definitely think there's a balance between choosing what you genuinely like and
[00:01:56.800] following and like keeping up with some trends, but also just leaving some behind and saying that's not for me. Yeah, I feel like it's pretty hard to kind of like what Jesus said, keep up,
[00:02:07.600] because all this stuff is getting thrown at you. And then you're like, oh, shoot, what would fit me? And then maybe it's like by the time you're like, oh, let me try on this new trendy thing. It's
[00:02:17.200] already four trends ahead. And you're like, wait, hold on. What's happening? Who am I? What am I? I guess the hardest part is maybe like owning it and maybe rejecting trends in itself is a whole
[00:02:30.320] style. Yeah, I can see that. But some people even say that developing your personal style can be anti trendy going against some trends. And that is your personal style and not following a trend.
[00:02:43.360] I think it ultimately comes down to what you personally like and what you feel comfortable in how that will define your personal style. That's a really interesting point, because sometimes I think about having like aspirational aesthetics. For example, recently, new jeans has been blowing
[00:03:00.000] up and I feel like they're very known for their like vintage retro Y2K kind of look. And I'm like that is so fucking cute. And they work it so well. But I've just gone through so many trial and error
[00:03:11.600] things in the past where I'm like, oh my god, this look is so cute. I'm gonna like take the plunge and buy it. And once I buy it, it just rots in my closet because I'm like, I don't know if this is
[00:03:22.480] me. It's one thing to think like, I can't pull it off. But the other side too is like, I wouldn't feel like myself in this clothing item. So then why like bother wearing it? So I think what you
[00:03:33.360] said about curating your personal style does require you to in some ways deviate from what's trendy, because not everything that looks good on other people looks good on you or makes you
[00:03:44.400] feel comfortable in it too. Sometimes when I see some of those retro styles, or even I know like rich girl aesthetic was really popping up pretty recently. It's not trying to like copy and paste
[00:03:56.640] the exact product or outfit, but it's more about identifying what about it do you like? So for example, the rich girl aesthetic, I think it's more about like clean lines, minimalist style, certain colors, like the color palette that I'm really drawn to. I try to identify what those
[00:04:14.320] pieces are, and then look at like when I go shopping, try to emulate some of those identifiers, I guess, in the pieces that I choose, and be really, really picky about the pieces that I choose.
[00:04:25.920] So that's kind of how I draw inspiration from trends other than try to copy and paste it exactly for what it is. Well, I guess I never even thought about that. To be fair, I'm not like super into
[00:04:35.600] fashion. So in my mind, I'm just like, okay, I guess this seems comfy. Or maybe it's like, I'll see someone dressed a certain way. And I'm like, Oh, I kind of like that style. But to me,
[00:04:46.400] it's almost more of like the vibe versus like the actual intricate details of like, you know, the lines, the color palette, that kind of stuff. I mean, I think that is your personal style.
[00:04:57.200] Like if you had a few words to identify your style, it seems like it's comfy, probably minimalist, probably a certain neutral colors that you like. I think sometimes I envision someone's personal style as like, you know, cartoon characters always wear like one outfit. Like
[00:05:14.160] to me, that's like the embodiment of someone's personal style. It's like if I were to picture this person as a cartoon character, what would they be wearing? Interesting. So if you had to choose your like, you know, iconic cartoon character outfit, what do you think it would be?
[00:05:31.760] My character would have a lot of accessories. I think that's like vintage bag, maybe some cool shoes, maybe a hat or something. But a pretty like a bucket hat. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do like bucket
[00:05:46.480] hats and earrings like jewelry. Yeah, so maybe maybe a character that's top to bottom dressed up. And it's not just like the outfit, like the clothing pieces, but it's the accessories and the secondary stuff. What about you both? Honestly, mine would be pretty simple,
[00:06:05.280] probably just like black pants, white t shirt and like white shoes. I see that. I always picture you in like your reddish plumish like v neck that you used to
[00:06:18.640] wear a lot. And I think now that I'm talking about it out loud, maybe it's because that's what your Venmo photo is. Oh, okay. I was like, I don't think I've owned a shirt like that for a really
[00:06:31.360] long time. I know. I always picture Chris. Oh my gosh. So we've been sending money to each other a lot. She's got that like what is a visual memory? Let's see. I think mine would be fairly
[00:06:47.440] simple. Probably just the white maxi skirt I've been wearing a ton this year. And then some sort of like gray short sleeve top and Birkenstocks probably because I can't seem to let those go. But which kinds of Birkenstocks? The Clogs? The classics? The Arizonas, the classics.
[00:07:06.640] She's a classic girly. Dude, actually, I feel like this exercise is really interesting because another like angle you could kind of think about this is if you were to try to get like artwork of
[00:07:20.000] yourself, what outfit would you want to be in? Now that we're talking about artwork, mine would be really colorful. I think for me, when I shop the things that I gravitate towards, because I go
[00:07:32.800] thrifting a lot, I could spend hours doing it, but I'm like really quick at it. Like I'm a very quick shopper because I always look at two things. It's fabric and color. And so if it were an art piece,
[00:07:44.560] it'd be canvas or it would be like a thicker material, but then it would also be very colorful. But the colors would be very complementary with each other. That would probably be my ideal art
[00:07:56.160] piece. I think that's a really interesting and good way to look at purchasing clothing actually, because we talked a little bit about micro trends and aesthetics that are trending, whether that's
[00:08:09.520] Y2K, rich girl, et cetera. And I feel like so much of that focuses on maybe more so like the shape or like that certain look that each piece has. And when you're doing a lot of online shopping,
[00:08:22.240] which I feel like is a little bit more common now, it is kind of hard, right? Like not everyone goes to like the product details and looks at what the material is made of and what percent of cotton and
[00:08:31.840] et cetera, et cetera, versus things like that are probably so much easier to spot and just even like feel with your fingertips in person. So do you feel like your affinity towards like thrifting and stuff helps you stay away from purchasing fast fashion things online? I think thrifting
[00:08:49.600] has helped me identify things that I should avoid when shopping online. So I actually do look at fabric content breakdowns very intently. I'm a very intentional shopper, I would say. I feel like with thrifting since thrifting from high school, I bought pieces that didn't work out or would
[00:09:10.320] break down pretty easily or would rip or pill or whatnot. So I feel like over time I've developed an understanding of what fabric or like what styles would last longer. So then when I go online,
[00:09:22.880] I'm like, okay, from my past experience of that top or that piece, I know like not to not to fall into this trap and not buy this piece online just because it's cheaper or it's on sale. So I definitely
[00:09:34.720] think thrifting has taught me to develop that eye a lot more because it's a lot more affordable and accessible. You can try on different trends, you can try on different colors when you thrift because
[00:09:45.600] it's so cheap and like not feel guilty about spending tons of money on something and then have to donate it or sell it. So I feel like thrifting has definitely helped me curate my closet
[00:09:56.880] and be a lot safer with my online purchases, I would say. Do you guys go thrifting? Not really. Oh really? Only with you. Oh I know Crystal does that. Why am I surprised?
[00:10:09.040] I've done it like a couple of times but I don't know. I always get like weird buyer's remorse after thrifting. Really? Yeah, like I'll like like it in store and then I'll come home and I'll be like
[00:10:19.360] actually I don't like this and I don't know why specifically with thrifting. Maybe it's more so that with thrifting you can't really like return stuff versus not doing that. It is more common to
[00:10:30.000] be able to return but I just don't trust myself to pick things well when I thrift. You get home you're like oh shit I can't return this now I suddenly don't like it anymore. I guess the good
[00:10:43.520] thing is that it's so cheap you may have like wasted you know a few dollars instead of buying something final sale online for a lot more and having it shipped and then not being able to like
[00:10:55.200] return it and ship it back. But that's so interesting huh I would have thought the opposite like not getting as much buyer remorse from thrifting because it's so cheap. I guess on the
[00:11:06.640] topic of thrifting being cheaper overall, I guess I never thought about this because like you said I don't really thrift but I always did wonder like oh thrifting feels more and more popular
[00:11:17.760] in recent times and once I started noticing it I was kind of wondering why and I guess that's like a really big aspect to it the one that you just mentioned how you know a lot of this stuff is
[00:11:30.000] previously used and loved but still has like a lot of life in them so they're typically a little cheaper and more affordable. Do you think there's any other aspect of it that affects its popularity?
[00:11:42.400] I definitely think it grew in popularity because a lot of influencers started doing it. I remember watching Jen Inn, like one of the OG YouTubers. She started off highlighting thrifting and
[00:11:58.000] like all her finds from thrifting so I think it really blew up in social media of just like what you could get when you go thrifting so I think that definitely contributed to it. I think there is
[00:12:11.920] for me personally there's a thrill to thrifting. I like going in with an open mind and just spending hours at the thrift store discovering things and being like really excited about thrifting finds
[00:12:24.800] so I think people just enjoy the act of thrifting and probably just the thrill of the hunt and that's probably what has helped it blow up in popularity. I also have two theories maybe
[00:12:36.880] minor like too macro or something but I feel like one thing about thrifting is that it's very like recession core so when the economy is in flux or maybe just not doing so well or people
[00:12:49.920] are getting laid off or etc I feel like thrifting is a good way to cut costs while still maintaining like the quality that you might be looking for so that could be one thing and I feel like the other
[00:13:01.840] flip side or benefit to thrifting is it's like more eco-friendly right? It's eco-friendly and it's very like community oriented whereas something like fast fashion where you partake knowing that there's exploitation in the supply chain can feel like something that you don't necessarily want to
[00:13:18.800] participate in yourself so then by going to thrift stores where you know it comes for the community you know other people have used it before and it's like more eco-friendly in a sense
[00:13:29.360] might draw a lot of like young people to it I think. It's definitely more sustainable there are so much clothing waste out there and there's so much clothing to go around right there is controversy
[00:13:40.880] around resellers like buying thrifted clothing from goodwill and then reselling it for a higher price on depop so there is definitely that discussion around thrifting but in general I feel
[00:13:51.520] like there's so much clothing to go around and we want to you know reduce waste as much as possible so a great way to do that and you know try out new things for your personal style is thrifting.
[00:14:03.200] I think it's like one of the most sustainable ways to partake in that. Dude do you think thrifting actually contributes to some of these other trends like Y2K or like you know more quote
[00:14:15.840] unquote vintage I don't know even like 80s or like retro styles to come back into fashion because people are like thrifting older clothes and then the trend just starts to like kind of move
[00:14:27.520] the needle moves a bit as more and more people are thrifting. Yeah probably I don't know if this is a right saying but I think they say that like trends cycle every 20 years something like that
[00:14:39.760] I don't know if it's 10 or 20 but in general like trends are very cyclical. I've definitely seen what you're saying though with the cycle of trends I remember the first time I got like a pair of
[00:14:51.920] Converse it must have been junior high or high school and my parents took one look at the shoe and they're like hey what the heck this is like the shoe that was popular when we were kids and
[00:15:01.600] I was like wait what the fuck these existed when you were like what and they're like dude yeah like this style was super in I can't believe it's like in for you guys now you lame old kids.
[00:15:13.120] That's cute I think my dad commented about my Converse too and said he played it he used to wear Converse when playing basketball oh wow in China. Dude can you imagine talking to our kids
[00:15:24.320] or something and we see them wearing those like Maison Margiela like the toe shoes yeah oh my god like people totally used to wear that when we were young. Oh my gosh that would be crazy I was gonna say
[00:15:38.560] another reason I think thrifting is popular is because some people argue that the quality of clothing was better back in the day I mean compared to fast fashion right so you can find a lot of OG
[00:15:50.800] brands with like 100% cotton or 100% linen clothing versus now where you go to Zara you go to fast fashion stores it's like 50% cotton or like even less than that so I think a lot of people
[00:16:05.120] go to thrifting to find those quality pieces that will last a lifetime I think that makes sense it's like you get more bang for your buck just a couple months ago I bought this sweater from Abercrombie
[00:16:15.360] and I was like oh my god it's like the cutest sweater ever and then I washed it once and it literally disintegrated it was pilling all over anywhere that had friction after one wash and
[00:16:26.800] you know I feel like it also makes me think more about what you said earlier Eileen about you buy the item and not necessarily like look at the other stuff because I'm very much like a brand
[00:16:37.920] person so I feel like in my head I have good quality brands and bad quality brands and expensive brands and like I sort it based on like the label or the name but even within brands
[00:16:49.120] some brands like Abercrombie I feel like certain things are more higher quality than other things or I have a friend who's like oh I go to this brand for jeans but I like this brand for shirts
[00:16:57.920] or whatever I think those distinctions can also help someone be a little bit more intentional with those things versus just hitting up like five stores and being like okay all of the items
[00:17:07.520] in these stores are safe yeah every time I go shopping I'm like can I thrift this or thrift something similar to this and if it's yes I'm like I'm not gonna get it at full price
[00:17:18.720] dang were we just like ungrateful for what we had back in the day when clothes were better quality and now we're chasing our youth by thrifting I mean it's like before our time
[00:17:30.080] like clothes like yeah some things but I do also want to kind of talk about like this vintage style and like more um like older trends in relation to thrifting I feel like there's been kind of a big
[00:17:43.120] wave of this like more nostalgic vibes like even in the so Jisoo you mentioned like new jeans earlier and I feel like they are so interesting because they're like the epitome of gen z but also they
[00:17:58.400] do a lot of these old school like nostalgic y2k styles it's very interesting that that's how it is there's a lot of big emphasis on like bringing back film cameras and like getting these like you
[00:18:11.600] know grainier videos for like you know the vibes the style versus now we have this technology that can give you like you know crystal clear stuff but people are finding a lot more joy in exploring
[00:18:23.920] these more um basically vintage style things so what are your thoughts on these what is so enticing about the vintage style so I feel like it's a common thing or common phenomenon for people
[00:18:38.880] to romanticize eras that they weren't necessarily born into so even if you're not a fan of vintage so even when we were young the tumblr era I felt like I was always romanticizing like the 90s grunge
[00:18:54.320] look or something you kind of flip back x number of decades and imagine like oh what if I was 20 years old like in that era I feel like that just kind of shifts out a little bit so and that could
[00:19:06.080] be one of the reasons why the early 2000s look is so in now because kids that might be growing up now were barely born at the cusp of Britney Spears and like that era you know it's true I know at
[00:19:19.200] least for myself vintage designer bags I have a collection myself and I've always been drawn to vintage designer bags than current day designer bags and I think for several reasons the price
[00:19:32.800] point is a lot cheaper to buy vintage than to buy new example like a Chanel bag can go for like $15,000 it's like way out of budget but you can get a vintage style for half or even a third of
[00:19:48.480] that price I think another reason beyond the price point is also like I was saying earlier the quality there was just a lot more emphasis on quality and craftsmanship before I have a bag
[00:20:00.960] that's older than me and it's still really in really great condition and it's awesome to think bag is older than me in age but it's still very functional and it's still almost in like
[00:20:14.560] pristine condition the fact that has stood the test of time just speaks to the craftsmanship and the quality of the material and I think the nostalgic factor like you were saying Crystal
[00:20:25.120] seeing some of these vintage styles of designer bags in my example are a lot more unique and rare okay that's not really nostalgic but it's like some of the vintage styles are a lot rare to find
[00:20:40.800] and come across than some of the newer ones that you can just buy in store honestly I think that makes sense the factor of having a bit of uniqueness to it versus you know everyone
[00:20:51.680] out there might have like the exact same thing during this current trend or whatever but you get to pull something out and be like oh my god yeah this has so much history it's like been around
[00:21:01.680] for longer than you and I I guess maybe there's almost even an element of mystery to it if you know like oh it's been 20 to 30 years of existence what was the previous owner like what adventures
[00:21:14.800] has this bag or whatever item gone on and now it's like ended up in my hands and I get to like add to its story that's so true the bag probably has seen more things than I have you know the bag has
[00:21:26.480] stories if only our bags could talk no I think that makes sense this is slightly a tangent but it kind of reminds me of when my parents first moved to Dallas and they were house hunting and my dad
[00:21:38.960] had said something to me about house hunting where he said what he looks for is not just the house itself but he also looks at the neighborhood and how many tall trees there are in a neighborhood
[00:21:51.520] because if there's a lot of tall trees it means that neighborhood has been there for a while it's not a lot of like new builds and like newer communities and stuff but it's kind of like a
[00:22:00.800] lived-in neighborhood with a lot of history if the trees are really tall then he knows that there is a lot of local history and that's what he's like drawn to maybe that's kind of why we're
[00:22:11.440] also drawn to things like vintage items and vintage looks because it's like tried and true a tested formula that works and if it has stood the test of time then it also speaks to like the
[00:22:22.720] longevity of it as well I feel like when people look for houses and they're looking for like mid century modern houses they look for homes with like exposed beams and all like architectural
[00:22:35.600] parts of a house that have stood the test of time I think people definitely get drawn to that too and I think it's also like maybe a rejection of the ultra capitalist society that we live in where
[00:22:48.880] now everything is like profit margins and how do we cut costs and increase prices and things like that like I feel like maybe even 30 years ago maybe the framework was still like how do we
[00:23:00.320] have profits but it was less so and less globally exploitative and things like that so quality of things back then like you said were also just better like better craftsmanship all around quality over quantity I think this also plays a part in as you're saying rejection of
[00:23:16.560] capitalistic stuff but also I read this interesting article about someone saying this could be like a rejection of perfection as we improve our technology you know things like AI or whatever produce quote-unquote perfect things that like are pleasing to the eye so I mean outside of AI
[00:23:38.160] and technology an example is like people always say if you have a fully symmetric face that's like you know very attractive or like one of the I guess like ultimate highest standard of universal
[00:23:48.720] attractiveness or something so having like more of these vintage things or just things that aren't in the modern day are just reminders of like how imperfections are also really nice just because
[00:24:02.320] it's not you know a perfectly round circle doesn't mean that it's still not really cool to look at or aesthetic or you know things like that and I thought that was like a pretty good theory and I
[00:24:14.640] can totally see how that plays a part because yeah a lot of things that we see nowadays are like super polished and then you know like the architectural digest videos of like visiting celebrity homes
[00:24:26.800] yeah I feel like so many comments are always like oh my god this house looks too sterile like are you actually even living in this like it's way too staged but then if we see like a celebrity's home
[00:24:37.520] that looks much more cozy and like you know there's kind of blankets thrown around or like their kids toys around then all the comments are like oh my god like this truly looks like someone's
[00:24:47.040] living in it it looks so comfortable doesn't matter that it's not pristine and like perfectly staged it's actually more attractive that it looks like people are actually inhabiting this house I think people are drawn to authenticity so that's probably why you know people are drawn to homes
[00:25:04.720] with character or homes with examples of real life like toys and kids stuff all around rather than something that's sterile and perfectly staged right yeah I wonder if there's also a slightly more personal nostalgic factor that plays into this too so for me I remember flipping through
[00:25:25.840] like my parents old photo albums when I was young you know back then the trends makeup trends fashion trends were all different right and I remember seeing old photos of my mom and she was probably
[00:25:36.400] like her in her early 30s and I would be like mom your lipstick is so brown and your hair is so curly and you're wearing pants that go up to your belly button like this fashion is so old and little did
[00:25:49.440] I know when I would be approaching the 30 year mark-ish that would be like exactly what's trending I feel like darker lipstick right now is like kind of in and high-waisted pants have been in
[00:26:01.280] for the last few years and things like that and maybe part of it is just on a macro level like trends cycle through every couple of decades like we've been talking about but I think on a different
[00:26:12.240] level too I am now nearing my mom's age that she was in those photos and maybe I kind of associate being 30 with like that look sort of so then it feels less foreign to me you know I'm like oh
[00:26:26.720] when my mom was this age like she had this look so I'm less opposed to it sort of I kind of fear the day where I decide to chop off my hair to like the mom look I'm trying to like yeah no
[00:26:43.120] and you like perm it and it's a little curly no I'm not getting there yet oh I think one of the funniest trends that I've seen that is like what you're saying kind of the more like mom and like
[00:26:57.760] dad look is the wireframe glasses oh because that's been like going on for a while now and the first time it popped up I was like oh my god my mom literally owns these glasses
[00:27:10.640] true that's cute actually I have a funny story high-waisted pants were really really trendy like I remember wearing them in college I mean they still are people still wear high-waisted pants but most recently I found that low and mid-rise jeans and pants have been much more
[00:27:29.280] comfortable for my like midriff area just because like when I eat I want to be able to feel my like I don't want to be suffocated by my high-waisted jeans anyways I went on a work trip and I brought
[00:27:41.440] my like they're labeled low-rise they're like the aritzia pants effortless pants and I was trying to tell my co-workers yo like these are really comfortable like low and mid-rise jeans and
[00:27:54.240] pants are the best thing ever and they were all laughing at me because they were saying no way they were saying how low and mid-rise were really really popular when they were younger and they
[00:28:06.320] were not going back to that trend so it's just funny how they wanted to reject that trend but I feel like Gen Z and our like the younger generation is trying to bring back the low and
[00:28:17.520] mid-rise pants I think it's also like dad shoes too yeah dad shoes oh my god I have this story that low-key is on my list of stories that keep me up at night but I remember once my parents went
[00:28:31.440] to Costco and they like came back with a haul and my dad had bought the dad shoes like the dad shoe you know like the Kirkland whatever like really super chunky all white dad shoe and he was like oh
[00:28:44.400] geez look I bought these new shoes they're so comfortable so padded aren't they cute and I remember sitting there and I was like seeing two paths diverge in front of me and I was like I
[00:28:53.840] could just be like yeah these are cute but I could also be honest elevate my dad's style and tell them they're ugly right so I sat there and I was like dad I'm not gonna lie like these are really hideous
[00:29:03.680] I don't think you should wear them I feel like it might be a better idea to return them because they're like really ugly and he was like oh okay and I'll never forget the look on my dad's face
[00:29:12.160] because he looked so sad and I was like what have I done so fast forward like two years dad shoes are f**king in they're like the rage every skinny 20 year old girl is wearing them on the streets
[00:29:25.120] and I was just like I feel so bad you know like little did I know they would come back and I also just hurt my dad's feelings for no reason so don't be like me damn Jesus oh hey it's okay you kept him cool for two years
[00:29:46.400] that's true that's pretty good as far as how long trends last seriously though but maybe your dad has been seeing these chunky dad shoes on the street and he's like damn Jisoo was right like why the f**k are these in style now
[00:30:03.120] your dad knew he did he knew what was coming exactly maybe he has foresight but also your story about low-rise jeans Aileen reminded me so I've mentioned this before but
[00:30:16.240] on TikTok I'm on millennial talk so I see actually so many not as much now but for a period of time I saw so many TikToks about rejecting low-rise they showed so many pictures of like you know
[00:30:29.920] the pants that are too low and like the peaking butt crack and all that stuff okay not that low we're not going that low but I do think that like super low rise is pretty accurate to that time
[00:30:41.520] I'm thinking of like Britney Spears like Jessica Simpson like all that but I do agree with mid-rise being good because personally I've never bought super into high rise just because I'm like dude
[00:30:54.400] I'm trying to sit down and like eat a big meal so I'm all for bringing back mid-rise yeah mid-rise is a way to go but that I feel like that does kind of relate to what we've mentioned earlier where
[00:31:08.160] like part of a pro of thrifting is that if there's like a style that's not really existing right now in terms of the stores aren't really selling it because it's not on trend then maybe you can find
[00:31:19.120] it when you're thrifting so maybe during the time where I was just high-waisted pants everywhere maybe if you really wanted an alternative style you could go thrifting and see if you could find
[00:31:30.400] something like that that's true it's almost like a time capsule to find things are not sold in popular stores today but are definitely at thrift stores yeah like what happened to all those circle scars
[00:31:42.560] we used to wear oh my god oh definitely can find those at goodwill I'm sure at this point you have to go to an antique market what if they come back in like 10 years like should we be keeping everything in our closet
[00:31:58.320] just to wait for the next time the trend comes around no that one's gotta go I'm just kidding I don't even know what was appealing about circle scarves maybe it was just it would never fall off your neck like maybe it was a functional like aspect
[00:32:15.200] of it you just wrap it around your neck instead of you know an annoying scarf that always falls off your neck or your shoulder I would love to see like devil wears prada there was one part
[00:32:27.520] of that movie where they said that it starts at these fashion houses and then those trends trickle down into you know what we see in stores and so I think about will a fashion house bring
[00:32:40.960] back circle scars and will eventually find its way to us so I yeah I will look forward to I don't know some tiktoks it would be really fascinating if if we see like a fashion house
[00:32:52.880] bring back circle scarves kind of doubt it but oh my god I know exactly what scene you're talking about it's the one where she's like yeah you just chose a blue sweater but that blue is like from
[00:33:04.080] this season like we had to make all these decisions yeah it's not lapis or whatever and she's like and you just picked that sweater out of like a discount bin like five years after
[00:33:15.200] the trend yeah damn yeah iconic when I watch youtube videos about trends of 2024 they always reference what is shown on the runway and so that to me it reminded me of devil wears prada in that
[00:33:32.160] scene of whatever we see on the runway can trickle down into more mainstream or like everyday stores I do kind of want to bring us back to like the personal style part of this all though
[00:33:46.080] so do you think your personal style developing it curating it is empowering just because in my mind I feel like it's very expressive it's like almost the first impression that you leave on people
[00:34:00.880] but I mean personally I don't put that much time into like developing as much of a unique style so I wonder like what your thoughts are on it as someone who's like much more into fashion and like
[00:34:13.600] curating this image I definitely think defining my personal style is very empowering I mean it's it's definitely something that I noticed when other people also put intentionality and thought into it as well I think personal style for me yeah like a reflection of how I'm feeling
[00:34:34.560] and if I feel really good about what I'm wearing I feel like I feel a lot more confident and I can carry myself a lot more confidently so sometimes when I meet people for the first time or I go to
[00:34:46.240] an event I will wear something that I know I'm comfortable wearing it like I'm comfortable it's almost like second skin like I'm comfortable wearing that certain piece or I know I won't
[00:34:56.400] have to fennec around with it or it will be oh it'll make me uncomfortable later in the day or sometimes I might wear a piece where it could be a conversation starter so for example recently
[00:35:07.520] I thrifted this like denim skirt in Japan that I really love it's comfortable I think it's cute it also emphasizes my personal style because it's a denim skirt I know that if another girly
[00:35:19.200] recognizes that and is like hey I love your skirt I'm like cool I can like start a conversation about it I could say like I thrifted it in Japan and that will start like a whole conversation
[00:35:29.120] around like oh you went to Japan so I feel like personal style can be a conversation starter it can be a way to connect people together like I met Camille because she complimented me on my pants
[00:35:40.800] back in college and that's how we became friends and I think personal style just it says a lot about you as a person I think and and in your taste so I feel like if other girls or people
[00:35:53.760] have that same taste it's a way to connect with each other I love that because I feel like it can definitely be a form of self-expression I feel like as someone who is a little bit less
[00:36:04.880] fashionable sometimes it feels like an obligation like I wake up I'm like oh I have to find an outfit again I feel that too but I think I know what you mean there's just like certain
[00:36:18.000] outfits or certain looks where I'm like I know I slay this outfit so going to an event with that can make me feel like the best version of myself or I know that the way it makes me look and feel
[00:36:30.400] just gives me a lot of confidence so definitely some empowerment there although I will say that sometimes I feel like I look a certain way and then someone has a comment about how I look and
[00:36:41.600] I'm like whoa is that how I portray myself because once my friend was like you always look like you're ready to go to the office and I was like is that really how I look? You're a corporate girlie. I'm like business casual.
[00:36:58.080] Oh that's funny I still remember I felt like when I first joined the corporate world or at least even back in college corporate workwear to me just felt so stale I remember
[00:37:13.680] early on just being like I can fit the mold in some ways but I want to break out of that too so like obviously I don't want to show too much skin or like I still want to wear pants but like
[00:37:25.280] can they be you know wide leg trousers can they be a colored trouser can I wear like a belt or change things up a little bit so I always feel like there are certain like even for some some
[00:37:36.000] of those looks like corporate workwear there are certain not guidelines but it's almost like there's a skeleton you know like a framework yeah there's a framework but personal style is when you kind of
[00:37:48.480] break out of that framework a little bit or you accessorize above that framework or you you know choose things like color or shape or texture that kind of break out of that typical framework that
[00:38:01.760] I feel like helps you identify the personal style a bit more. Dude but what if you're like trying a new style but you don't feel confident about it like how do you grow into that then? I would say
[00:38:14.240] either don't force it just don't do it yeah like if you don't feel comfortable in it don't do it I remember there were some cute tops that were like really trending and I was just like you know
[00:38:25.840] with my body type like I feel too flashy I feel too like uncomfortable with it I'm just not if I'm not comfortable in it it's too finicky like I'm just not even gonna try and then I guess the
[00:38:37.360] second tip is if you still want to try it maybe add something to it to make it more comfortable so if the top is too revealing is there a way to have like a certain part of it like another piece
[00:38:48.960] to add on top of it so it's not less revealing I don't know is there a way to style it differently so you do feel comfortable in it but I would say overall if you're not comfortable don't force it.
[00:39:00.480] That kind of reminds me of have you seen the TikTok video where that lady is teaching you how to acclimate to the temperature of the water so she's like put your hands in the water put your
[00:39:08.400] arms in the water and it's just like I guess easing into the temperature of the water and I feel like that can honestly be applied to a lot of things in life because there's certain pieces
[00:39:18.000] in my closet where I'm like mildly embarrassed to wear it around people I know but that doesn't mean I can't wear it around strangers or to like grocery shop or like something like that
[00:39:28.080] so I think easing into it in that way could also help. That's true yeah maybe it's finding the situations or the right context for you to feel comfortable wearing it and trying it out
[00:39:40.960] I like that. Do you think you aim to portray a certain thing about yourself through your personal style or is it more just like this is just a collection of things that I enjoy to wear?
[00:39:53.440] I don't know I mean I definitely like to be portrayed as fashionable. Oh well I think that's fair yeah. I mean not all the time like when I go out to eat I'm not like I want to be fashionable
[00:40:07.120] I want people to know I'm fashionable but I think maybe for certain occasions meeting people for the first time I definitely like to be portrayed as fashionable or has an eye for fashion I think
[00:40:21.440] deep down that's probably what I think but I'm not like today I want to be known as fashionable like when I go out at this event they better damn know I'm fashionable.
[00:40:30.640] Better be getting DMs like where did you get your outfit from? Exactly like I'm not trying to do that but I think like you know the inner me is like if I get a compliment tonight on my
[00:40:41.040] on this skirt that I chose or like the shoes that's gonna bring joy you know. I think that makes sense for me I feel like I try to seem polished maybe that's why the business casual
[00:40:53.920] opinion was once shared but I think also there's like a certain image that I have in mind based on the setting that I'm going to so like when I go golf or something I like think of like the
[00:41:06.320] golf girl look or like you know like there's something in my head when I put together an outfit or like an ensemble that I go for so maybe it's not always just like a permanent personality
[00:41:15.680] thing that I'm trying to portray but just specific snapshots of images that I'm like oh this is like the look I want to have today. Sometimes I wonder when I go on work trips and I choose my outfit I
[00:41:26.480] wonder if people look at me and are like that's definitely a designer like like like she like the way she dresses the way she looks she's definitely a designer. I always wonder that I wonder if people
[00:41:37.920] think that because different roles at my company there's definitely like a general you know theme that happens like engineers are really casual designers are definitely a lot more dressy so I wonder if people see me and they think that they clock you. Yeah it's because I'm Asian too
[00:41:59.760] designers are Asian. They're like nah she's definitely an engineer. Yeah but I mean I think that's getting into stereotypes which is not so great there's definitely engineers that are really stylish too. It's okay you don't have to try to save it.
[00:42:18.720] Put it on the record. On the walk back. Engineers listening to this like what the f**k girl you were hella stylish. There's also like different fashion I noticed in my company is in New York so I go to New York
[00:42:34.800] trips the fashion there is obviously fashion capital versus when I used to work in SF. Very techy very like Patagonia athleisure wear I guess so the style is very very different.
[00:42:47.760] Dude for sure one time I went into a New York office and I literally like the first time ever I felt like wow I don't feel like I'm cool enough to be in this office like why is everyone dressed
[00:42:59.600] so well I'm so used to the Bay Area where people are like practically in their pjs. Yeah everyone in New York dresses really really well. I always feel like my dressing up to a 10 there is everyone's normal. Oh especially in Korea everyone was dressed to the 10s. Right.
[00:43:21.280] I was like wow everyone looks so good and Japan as well like everyone was very expressive with their fashion. Do you think you would enjoy that more living in a very fashionable city
[00:43:32.560] versus one that's more maybe like casual? I think I mean there's always a middle ground I guess like if I had to dress up every single day and like have makeup every single day I think I would feel
[00:43:44.080] tired of it eventually but the other side of it is like in Sacramento no offense sometimes I feel like I'm overdressed and it kind of feel like I have to underdress sometimes
[00:43:58.080] because I need to fit in or like because I don't know I just don't want to be too flashy when I'm over like when I'm dressing too much so I feel like sometimes that I don't enjoy that sometimes
[00:44:09.440] I love to dress up as well and I wish I could you know dress up more but I don't want to also draw too much attention. I think I try to find the middle ground here. What elements do you guys
[00:44:21.600] think inspire your personal style? This is an interesting one to me because I consume a lot of social media content like I'm on TikTok for a crazy number of hours on the daily
[00:44:37.680] and I think I realized that I need to be able to picture something for it to be appealing to me so what I mean is like if I see something on like a store website for example I might be like oh
[00:44:51.520] this is cute but I don't know if I like really want to buy it you know but if I see someone who looks like me or has a similar sense of style as me or lives in the same area as me or has some
[00:45:03.600] sort of connection slash similarity wearing it then it's way more appealing to me so unfortunately I feel like I have to literally directly see someone who I can kind of relate to wear it and
[00:45:16.400] then I'm like oh this is cute like now I want it. Is it anyone on the street that you think looks like you or is it specific people online or both? I think it's like both like I just need to see
[00:45:28.720] someone in my vicinity somehow like wear it and then I can be like oh this is cute like I can see this going with that kind of outfit like I guess I'm saying I'm not super imaginative to where
[00:45:39.120] I could see a piece and be like oh now I envision 40 outfits with this you know it's more like I need to see specific fits and curated looks and then I'm like oh okay this seems like something I
[00:45:49.520] could work into my closet. I resonate with that like I actually use Pinterest a lot for inspiration I like to see pictures of other people styling certain pieces before I like commit to you know
[00:46:03.280] spending money on something or investing in something. I actually do a lot of research before I buy something like just recently I bought some new shoes they're not super bold but they're like brown shoes and I've never styled brown shoes before so I literally searched up brown
[00:46:17.520] shoe outfits and I looked at all these images of outfits and just double checked whether or not that would fit into my current pieces in my closet but then I also you know think back at my closet
[00:46:31.120] would brown shoes complement current outfits that I like to wear? Would it be something that can easily style? So I definitely seek inspiration from external sources as well and also friends too
[00:46:43.200] so if I go on Instagram I see friends with really cool you know outfit I'm like oh that just inspired me and I want to try something like that too or look out for something like that when I shop
[00:46:55.200] so definitely like to seek inspiration as well. I think for me something that I also keep an eye out for is like staple items like what is something that can be used across a lot of different
[00:47:08.880] situations? I guess now that I'm thinking about it consistency is something that I look for. I think it just makes things easier sometimes if there's like too many options or like I don't know what I'm doing then maybe I'll feel more uncomfortable so ultimately it's like what
[00:47:25.440] is going to make me feel comfortable and what is something that is going to be like applicable in various situations? I guess like as an example very specifically like imagine you're gonna go
[00:47:36.560] somewhere and you're gonna meet all these new people but if you get to like I don't know wear your favorite jacket then you know you'll feel really okay because you have a piece of like you
[00:47:47.360] have something of comfort with you versus like you're trying to go all out and like impress everyone and then you're like oh god I like have never worn this outfit before so I don't know like
[00:47:58.320] who I am right now or like what I'm doing right now so I guess kind of along those like lines. Yeah you like things that are tried and true. Now I'm just imagining like a emotional support jacket.
[00:48:14.640] A life jacket? Oh my god wait line blown but you know like people in sports and stuff they're like yeah I wear like my lucky underwear. Oh yeah. So it's kind of like that right it's like something
[00:48:27.600] that'll bring you like comfort and like luck and familiarity. But I also feel like that means you you don't over consume like you don't over buy which is really good too you don't buy more than
[00:48:38.880] you need everything that you have provides some sort of functional value that you don't need to over consume or buy too much. Yeah but I think there's definitely maybe some moments where
[00:48:48.720] I don't know maybe I'm like feeling myself or whatever and then I buy something and I'm like wait what was I on because this is definitely not something like you know. Dude I feel that. Yeah like I shouldn't have bought this like I don't know why I did.
[00:49:02.720] Like you wake up from the fever dream you're like okay we need to head back and return this immediately. Like who authorized this purchase? Exactly yeah. You know how they joke around like bury me in
[00:49:14.640] this outfit or bury me with this? What is one article of clothing your house is on fire if you have to save one piece of clothing what would it be? Dang. Wait I'm not gonna lie I feel
[00:49:26.480] like most of the things oh wait actually I do know one of the things so there's like these pants that I wear and they're like discontinued so I literally had to go on eBay and I bought like three or four
[00:49:39.920] of these pants because I was like I don't know if they'll ever come back so I would probably grab at least one of those. That's good. Okay so I have this pair of black sandals like strappy sandals
[00:49:52.560] that I bought years ago I'm talking like mid-college and then I have gotten so many compliments on them but it's obviously been over seven years since I've had them so they're like scuffed on the side
[00:50:06.480] and shit but I can't let them go because they're so cute and I can't find like a similar quality replacement so I still have them but I think those are my go-to's. I was gonna actually say
[00:50:18.160] running shoes for me I mean I think it goes down to like functionality at the end of the day I realized in the past few years how important running shoes are running and walking shoes are
[00:50:30.320] for my feet and it can really make a difference so even after walking like 20,000 steps a day in Asia because I had proper walking running shoes it really made a difference in my feet and I didn't
[00:50:41.920] have blisters I didn't have feet pain like I did back in 2017 when I didn't have proper walking shoes so really made a difference in that probably be something I could not live without.
