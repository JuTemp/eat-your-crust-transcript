[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:15.360] Today we wanted to talk about kind of a unique event in our lives, which is high school 10-year
[00:00:24.280] reunions. It's kind of crazy to think that we are at that time now. I feel like when we were actually
[00:00:31.860] in high school, the thought of the 10-year reunion seems so far and foreign maybe. Now it's like,
[00:00:39.640] damn, we're here. Yeah, somehow I feel like there was more anticipation about a 10-year reunion
[00:00:45.880] a couple years back. And then now that the actual 10-year reunions are happening,
[00:00:50.700] it's interesting to see who steps up in the, I guess, quote unquote, student body. Also,
[00:00:57.960] who is still excited to go, who is trying not to go and see those paths diverge a little bit.
[00:01:03.420] And I think it's especially interesting too for us because both you and I have kind of moved back
[00:01:09.500] into the general Bay Area, which is our hometown and where our high schools were.
[00:01:14.580] Yeah.
[00:01:15.300] So I feel like we also have different perspectives from people who moved away,
[00:01:19.640] went to college, out of state, etc.
[00:01:22.280] So true. It can be a long journey to come back because usually these reunions are held
[00:01:28.420] in the hometown area of the high school. And I feel like just the concept of seeing all these people
[00:01:35.340] again is so nostalgic, but also maybe like a little anxiety-inducing.
[00:01:43.200] Well, it's interesting that you say that because, Crystal, you actually hosted your high school's
[00:01:49.940] 10-year reunion recently. So what inspired you to step up and take on that role?
[00:01:55.100] Honestly, I wanted to attend a 10-year reunion. It's just like an interesting event to go to,
[00:02:02.720] to see how everyone has grown up and matured and catch up with people who maybe you were close with
[00:02:09.300] in high school, but just ended up not really keeping in contact with afterwards.
[00:02:15.460] How I ended up hosting my 10-year reunion, I actually reached out to my class president,
[00:02:22.200] who I think that is traditionally the person who is in charge of planning this stuff.
[00:02:27.500] I asked her if she was planning on organizing this event. And she was like,
[00:02:33.820] no, not really. I'm not super invested, have little to no interest in hosting it.
[00:02:41.760] I think also at the time, she was out of state, so it would have been difficult for her.
[00:02:47.900] And at first, I was like, oh, okay, that's a shame. But as the year went by, I was like,
[00:02:53.580] maybe it would be kind of sad if we truly didn't have a reunion. Sure, maybe some people have the
[00:03:00.720] stance of, I don't want to go. But there could be just as many people who have the mindset of
[00:03:06.300] wanting to go. And so it would truly be a shame if we didn't have one just because these select few
[00:03:12.780] people didn't want to go. Right. So I thought it would be better to have one than to not. So I
[00:03:19.280] asked our class president again, just to help out a little bit in terms of contact info and reaching
[00:03:25.960] out to people, that kind of stuff. But I was like, if you don't want to plan it, I can throw something
[00:03:30.840] together. And it turned out not to be too difficult. So it worked out in the end. So then what do you
[00:03:36.760] think ended up being a lot easier than you thought? And what were some of the more challenging aspects?
[00:03:43.300] Okay, I'm not even gonna lie. It wasn't hard at all. If anyone has ever planned an event,
[00:03:53.640] like even their own birthday party, I feel like it's very similar.
[00:03:59.400] So maybe something that was slightly more challenging is like, reaching out to people.
[00:04:04.360] I don't know if people's high school emails are the emails they're still using now. Right. Our class has a
[00:04:09.920] little Facebook group. So I posted in there. And honestly, it was just like, if you see it, you see it.
[00:04:14.400] I think if people wanted to attend, they would they would make an effort to figure out if it's happening.
[00:04:19.460] Yeah. Yeah. But like, honestly, reaching out to a location, figuring out that stuff ended up being
[00:04:27.440] even easier than I thought. Maybe it's because the place I chose ended up just being like really
[00:04:32.480] chill about it. I was like, hey, can I rent out a space for like around 150 people? And they're
[00:04:37.980] like, yeah, for sure. Fill out a form online. You're set. Okay, that was like super easy.
[00:04:44.200] I feel like the venue you chose was nice too, because it wasn't like a venue that had super strict
[00:04:49.900] entry rules or anything like that. I feel like that would have added a layer of complexity.
[00:04:53.920] And it also wasn't a place that had a strict capacity of like, it's going to feel really
[00:04:59.720] squished if more than X number of people show up. Yeah. So then I feel like having that flexibility
[00:05:04.640] did help the logistics feel a lot more smoother and more seamless. Maybe like the only downside was that
[00:05:11.420] it was outdoors. And so it did get a little cold at night. But I think for the most part, it was
[00:05:16.540] like pretty solid. It didn't end up being that cold that day. Luckily.
[00:05:20.360] I know, which is crazy, because I work actually pretty closely to where that venue is. So then
[00:05:27.800] the week prior, I had gone out to dinner with my friend and it was like the coldest day of all time.
[00:05:32.860] I was like, oh my god, thank god I have this brand new puffer jacket that I bought. Otherwise,
[00:05:38.080] I wouldn't survive this cold. And when I was there eating with my friend, I was like, dude,
[00:05:42.520] we're fucked next week. Like it's gonna be so cold. But then seven days pass, all the rain stops,
[00:05:49.220] like the cold freeze or whatever was gone. The bomb cyclone or whatever was also far into the past.
[00:05:56.360] And it was just like a perfectly nice, mildly chilly day. It was great.
[00:06:00.840] I was thankful for that. I think I was slightly worried about weather. But also at the same time,
[00:06:05.740] we're in California. So I was like, we'll probably be okay.
[00:06:08.720] You're like, there's gonna be no snow.
[00:06:12.060] Okay, but as you mentioned, you actually went to my high school reunion. So how did that feel
[00:06:18.760] as someone who didn't go to like, my high school?
[00:06:22.100] I think it was a very interesting experience. And I was actually more excited to go to
[00:06:26.640] this one than my high school reunion. But there was a couple things that I felt. So
[00:06:32.500] one was I thought more people would bring plus ones. I was surprised to see that there wasn't a ton.
[00:06:40.440] And you know, it's not that I know that many people that went to your high school and were in
[00:06:45.180] your class. So I guess I wouldn't have been able to decipher who exactly was a plus one and who wasn't
[00:06:50.700] from a distance. Right. But from what I could see, most people were chatting about high school
[00:06:55.320] memories and whatnot. The only plus ones that I can kind of figure out were the ones that I already
[00:07:00.520] knew. We kind of had a little plus one huddle in the corner, which was nice. Honestly, like going to
[00:07:08.480] your high school reunion, I kind of felt like damn, it's a shame that I won't be able to go to ours.
[00:07:13.100] Because it kind of felt very special being there. And this is the mindset that I kind of had not
[00:07:20.920] going to mind slash what I think a lot of people might commonly feel is you know what I'm like close
[00:07:27.060] by to my hometown. I still talk to a ton of high school people. If I wanted to keep up with them
[00:07:32.760] or catch up with them, I would be in touch with them still. What is the true value added of me going
[00:07:39.680] to like a reunion? Right. But actually being there, I was like, you know, there is something special
[00:07:45.600] about getting everyone in one place and hanging out because that's what truly takes you back to like
[00:07:51.060] school times. Yeah, like you don't get that same vibe hanging out one on one or with like a group of
[00:07:57.040] people. You only get that Oh, we're at like a school assembly vibe when there's 150 of your classmates
[00:08:04.600] at a beer garden outdoors on a cold night. It did feel very special. And I was like, this is awesome.
[00:08:11.980] But I will say I felt like I had to fend for myself a little bit as a plus one because I didn't want to
[00:08:17.360] be like the old ball and chain being like, Oh, introduce me to all of your classmates.
[00:08:22.780] James. Yeah, yeah. I mean, honestly, I feel like a lot of people that ended up going I maybe knew
[00:08:31.120] their face or I knew their name, but then I like didn't remember the other part. Yeah, I knew their
[00:08:36.400] face, but I forgot their name or I knew their name, but I forgot their face. At first, I was too
[00:08:41.500] embarrassed, I guess to be like, Oh, what was your name again? But I think towards the middle and like
[00:08:47.340] after more people came, it felt way more normal. And like understandable to be like, Oh my god,
[00:08:53.640] I remember you. But like, I totally forgot your name. I'm so sorry. So I wonder if anyone came up
[00:08:59.040] to you and said that. So actually, you and your boyfriend and me and James, the four of us carpooled.
[00:09:08.120] Right. And when we had gotten to the venue, there was already like a little group of people who had
[00:09:13.620] showed up and were kind of like excited to hang out and chat. And when the four of us walked up to that
[00:09:19.220] group, this guy turned around and said to me, he was like, Oh, I remember we like chatted a little
[00:09:24.740] bit. But I had no idea who this person was. And I just thought it was funny that he said it to me
[00:09:30.700] first and then turned to James. So in my head, I was like, Oh my god, I'm like assimilating into
[00:09:35.920] the world of this high school. You're like, I'm basically this high school alumni. Yeah.
[00:09:42.960] We like shook hands. And I was like, Yeah, it's so nice to see you again. Because I didn't want to
[00:09:47.400] be like, I'm a plus one. I didn't go here. So I was just like quietly trying to pretend like I was
[00:09:54.760] one of you guys. I know at one point in the night, someone was chatting with me and a few other
[00:10:01.980] people. And then they turned to my boyfriend and was like, Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't quite remember
[00:10:07.480] who you are. And he was like, Oh, no, I'm like a plus one. Don't like you don't know me.
[00:10:12.460] Dude, he should have assimilated just like me. There was two paths there.
[00:10:20.440] No, but then he says his name or something. And then they'd be like, I don't remember that person
[00:10:25.060] being in class. And then he gaslights them. He's like, What the fuck? We were PE together.
[00:10:31.740] Well, it's funny that you say that because I was just hanging out with my friend last night.
[00:10:35.440] She was telling me that she had recently gone to her fiance's reunion. Yeah. And she said that when
[00:10:41.800] she got there, there were little name tags for everyone to like write their name on just to like
[00:10:46.920] jog people's memory. But if you were a plus one, you have another neon sticker on top of that
[00:10:54.020] designating you a second class citizen slash plus one. And I was like, Oh my god, I don't know how
[00:11:00.860] I would feel about that. On one hand, it would help to avoid this awkward moment, you know, where
[00:11:05.920] people are confused whether you're a plus one or not. But right. But I feel like in some ways,
[00:11:10.980] it could be potentially alienating slash othering. I don't know. But I think it worked out to her
[00:11:17.100] favor because she said she had a little group of other plus ones. And you're like able to easily
[00:11:21.920] identify the other plus ones because of that sticker. They're like, okay, that huddle over
[00:11:26.260] there is just a plus one huddle. That's the safe circle. Also, though, speaking of plus ones,
[00:11:34.660] I think I agree with you where I was kind of surprised not more people brought plus ones.
[00:11:40.080] Yeah, I specifically said when I like posted about the event, I was like plus ones are welcome.
[00:11:45.480] I was hoping more people would bring plus ones.
[00:11:49.160] You know, what I thought was also funny was when people came into the venue, you can kind of see
[00:11:54.560] who they're coming in with. Right. Since I wasn't an alumni, I was like observing, you know, like I
[00:12:00.740] wasn't the one actively catching up with classmates. I was just like looking around occasionally talking
[00:12:04.800] to your boyfriend or some of our other friends plus ones. I thought it was interesting when people
[00:12:10.380] came in by themselves. Because that's kind of like a power move in my mind, I guess. And I also
[00:12:17.080] noticed that a bunch of people came in like groups of three or four, which to me is very similar to
[00:12:24.040] like what happens in high school, you hang out with like your friend groups or like a couple of friends
[00:12:28.200] and you go do things together. So I was like, Oh my god, this is like very nostalgic, you know?
[00:12:33.460] Yeah, I feel like having a buffer, I guess, one or two people at least to go with definitely makes
[00:12:40.240] you feel less awkward. Probably. When I was putting all this together, I guess like the biggest worry I
[00:12:46.400] had was like, what if no one shows up? So I like forced our little friend group. I'm hosting this so
[00:12:52.880] you guys all have to come. Where you texted me, I expect you and James to be there. I was like,
[00:12:59.860] no worries, we're coming. I was like, this is a very stern text message.
[00:13:06.650] Yeah, it's funny too, because I think actually most of our friend group who did go to high school
[00:13:12.950] with me were very iffy about the reunion or maybe like on the fence. And then because I ended up
[00:13:19.970] putting it together and kind of forcing everyone, implying that everyone needs to go because I put
[00:13:26.630] it together, they're like, okay, fine, like, I'll go. But I mean, I think even the people who were
[00:13:32.350] hesitant about going and honestly, even day of, I feel like before their reunion, there was a little
[00:13:39.450] bit of sentiment of like, is it just going to be us talking in a corner the whole time or something
[00:13:44.570] like that? Yeah. Despite all of these worries, I think everyone ended up having a good time catching
[00:13:50.010] up with faces that they forgot about and stuff. And yeah, just like hanging out and chatting. It was
[00:13:55.350] like very good vibes. Yeah, yeah. I think that was like another thing. The vibes were immaculate,
[00:14:00.910] low key. It really was to the point where I was like chatting with one of your guys's classmates.
[00:14:08.170] And he was like, you know, I showed up trying to gather tea and like find out what the latest gossip
[00:14:14.450] is. But no one's been gossiping. It's just been very like wholesome. Yeah. Like, oh, yeah. Like,
[00:14:19.750] I feel the same way. Like, where's the tea? Yeah, everyone was just like happy to be there
[00:14:25.850] and really friendly. They came with a positive attitude, basically. And I think that's what
[00:14:31.370] really made it. My guess is like maybe people's attitude was like, oh, I'll show up and see how
[00:14:37.250] it is. Worst case, you know, I can just dip early. Right. No one came like grumpily, if that makes sense.
[00:14:44.470] Yeah, I guess if you really didn't want to be there, you wouldn't come anyway. Exactly.
[00:14:47.510] So maybe it weeded out people who would have neutral to negative vibes.
[00:14:52.550] It was so interesting. A lot of people ended up thanking me for like putting it all together.
[00:14:57.670] And I was like, oh, it was like no bother. It's fine. I like didn't really think about it as a
[00:15:02.850] thankworthy thing. But it was interesting to see people were like very thankful that it happened.
[00:15:10.290] I find it very fascinating, honestly, that you're like, oh, it's like no biggie,
[00:15:13.730] because I feel like it's a big task to take on. It's like one thing to do something that's kind of
[00:15:18.810] handed to you slash expected of you. And then another thing to like step up like, yeah, it's
[00:15:23.230] fine. I'll just take care of it. Your boyfriend and I were watching you float through the groups
[00:15:27.750] throughout the night because the other thing too is that since you're the host, you had all the drink
[00:15:31.750] tickets in your hand. Right. So it was almost mandatory that everyone who attended the reunion
[00:15:36.170] came up to you and like checked in with you. Yeah. Watching you chat, I think with like everyone
[00:15:41.710] who came by was very cool. And it was very cute. Everyone just looked so happy to talk to you
[00:15:47.550] slash get a drink ticket. At the end of the night, a lot of people came up and were like, hey, do you
[00:15:53.550] have like extra drink tickets that people like didn't pick up or something? Yeah. Also, a really
[00:16:00.370] funny thing is someone bought five tickets because each ticket comes with a drink ticket.
[00:16:05.930] At first, I just thought that this person was going to bring four plus ones. But then I realized
[00:16:12.010] because he came up to me, he was like, can I get all those drink tickets? I was like, wait, this guy
[00:16:16.870] ripped himself off because the ticket has the like venue rental baked into it. It's okay. He's
[00:16:23.750] contributing to the cause. Yeah. Like this is my investment into the vibes. Yeah. Yeah. But I
[00:16:30.790] thought that was funny. I was like, oh yeah, I guess that is like a method. You could have just
[00:16:34.210] bought a bunch of like drink tickets. Actually, I think we witnessed that conversation. And then
[00:16:39.290] me and your boyfriend were just watching and then he turned to us. He's like, guys, I swear I actually
[00:16:43.930] bought these tickets. I'm not just trying to rip them off of her. So we're like, it's okay.
[00:16:48.270] We didn't think that at all. You're like, actually, it seems more like crystal ripped you off.
[00:16:54.370] Well, to an extent, I was shocked to be noticed. I was like, oh my god, I have like a physical body.
[00:16:59.130] I'm not just a wallflower. Oh my god. Yeah. You mentioned that you're not going to your
[00:17:06.930] reunion though, even after such a dare I say successful
[00:17:13.330] reunion event. If I do say so myself. But yeah, I am not attending ours. I mean, part of it is just
[00:17:21.790] logistics. So usually around the holidays, I tend to have a ton of like obligations and plans
[00:17:28.510] like many people do. And our reunion is actually scheduled to be just a couple days away from
[00:17:34.250] Christmas time. So I was like, I think just timing wise, it doesn't work out. There's like
[00:17:39.450] things I have to do. But I do have a bunch of friends who are going to be going. So they were
[00:17:44.910] like, oh, I'll tell you all the tea that happens if there is. Yeah. I know you were more on the
[00:17:51.750] skeptical side slash on the fence about going to your own. But do you feel like you were more
[00:17:57.110] encouraged to try to go to yours after seeing what like a 10 year reunion looked like?
[00:18:04.530] Honestly, yeah. After going to yours, I was like, damn, it sucks out that the like logistics didn't
[00:18:09.790] work out. And I have to miss mine. Because I do think it would have been fun. Yeah. But I will say
[00:18:15.050] the one factor that does leave a little bit of hesitance for me is your high school class is a
[00:18:22.150] lot bigger than ours. So then I feel like there's a different set of like maybe vibes or expectations
[00:18:28.350] that come with like a bigger high school class versus a smaller one. Oh, okay. That's fair. That's
[00:18:33.450] fair. I mean, yeah, like ultimately, my class is about 500 people. And we had about 150 people show
[00:18:41.150] up, which I guess like percentage wise, is not the greatest. But at the same time, like 150 is a lot
[00:18:47.830] of people. I feel like that's a huge success. Honestly, I remember our class being like less
[00:18:53.670] than 400 people. So I guess quantity wise, it's not like that big of a difference. But there was a
[00:18:59.670] little bit of like a smaller high school vibe to our class, I would say. Yeah. And with a lot of
[00:19:04.990] people staying in state, I feel like the circles have just kind of stayed the same. So I don't know
[00:19:11.130] what will happen at our reunion. But I'll report back if there's anything interesting.
[00:19:16.350] Would you drag James with you if you did end up going to yours?
[00:19:19.810] Oh, yeah. I don't think I would go by myself. Well, I guess I could have just like,
[00:19:24.670] gone with a bunch of our friends and whatnot. But from what I've gathered from our
[00:19:29.670] friends, it seems like a decent number of people would bring their plus ones. So maybe ours would
[00:19:35.050] have had more of a plus one vibe than your reunion. That's super cool. I feel like it's just
[00:19:41.210] so interesting to see like the people a lot of your friends or fellow classmates end up with. And
[00:19:47.290] sometimes it's even more interesting because they end up with each other, but you just didn't know.
[00:19:51.850] Oh, yeah, that's true. Did you have anything like that? Your reunion?
[00:19:56.650] There was someone who said he ended up dating someone from our class, but she couldn't make
[00:20:02.210] it this time. So I was like, whoa, that's crazy. What were some other things that you were like
[00:20:07.910] shocked to find out at your reunion? Actually, surprisingly, a lot of people are still in the
[00:20:13.010] bay. I mean, I guess like when you think about it, that does seem very reasonable. But I guess I was also
[00:20:19.850] at the same time a bit surprised that more people weren't out of state. I feel like a good chunk of
[00:20:25.070] my class went to school out of state. And I feel like sometimes that results in staying out of state
[00:20:30.650] for work. But yeah, I think most people who ended up coming are like still in the bay.
[00:20:36.130] I feel like to me, it's clicking because I think every single person that I talked to
[00:20:42.330] at your reunion was an engineer. Like I'm like, not even exaggerating. Yeah.
[00:20:47.430] And half of them had been like working at some sort of startup. The other half was like in big tech.
[00:20:52.290] Yeah. So I feel like that's very San Francisco vibes.
[00:20:55.590] Okay. Yeah, that's true. That's very like my high school vibes, like STEM and all of that.
[00:21:00.490] But it was also funny because a lot of people I would ask like, oh, are you in like the bay SF or
[00:21:05.930] whatever? A lot of people were like, dude, I live a couple blocks from this place. Wow.
[00:21:11.390] They got lucky with the logistics then.
[00:21:13.490] I think I had an expectation for 10 year reunions. Maybe like it was a very hyped up expectation because
[00:21:20.690] I feel like in media, it's portrayed as a very dramatic thing. Do you know what I mean?
[00:21:27.090] People make their entrance and it's like so dramatic. Everyone watches as like the new person joins the
[00:21:34.110] event. Yeah.
[00:21:35.630] Yeah.
[00:21:36.130] There's whispers and goss about who showed up and like with who and like all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:42.670] But as we mentioned, actually being there, it was just like way more chill and it was just like
[00:21:47.130] positive vibes in that aspect. I thought it was kind of funny.
[00:21:50.550] Yeah, that's a good point. And I feel like also 10 year reunions in the media have some sort of drama,
[00:21:57.030] like a fight breaks out or like people hook up or something like that.
[00:22:00.470] But this one was literally just like, oh my God, like how have you been? Catch up on life and just
[00:22:05.910] things that have happened in the last 10 years. And then everyone went home like no one was
[00:22:10.190] belligerent or too drunk or being mean or gossipy. It was just like very wholesome.
[00:22:17.230] Yeah. I think it's also interesting because these like 10 year reunions or whatever are kind of
[00:22:23.870] universal almost. My parents have talked about having reunions, but for them, it wasn't high
[00:22:31.030] school. It was college because their college class was like really small. And so they ended up knowing
[00:22:37.290] everyone. Unlike us, I feel like it would be impossible to like even know more than, I don't
[00:22:43.530] know, 10 people in our college class. Right.
[00:22:45.970] But my parents said for them, it's a 20 year reunion because there's a Chinese song that references
[00:22:52.770] like 20, like see you in 20 years. So they don't do 10 year reunions. They do 20 year reunion.
[00:22:58.850] Wow. That's pretty cool. Honestly. I do think too, like the 20 year reunion would be more
[00:23:05.950] memorable or like monumental, I guess, because that's when you can truly look back and feel
[00:23:10.950] nostalgic. Like I feel like 10 year, I don't feel removed enough yet.
[00:23:14.930] True, true. I'm like, that was just yesterday that we were all like seniors.
[00:23:19.390] So true. Oh my God. Actually, speaking of that, there were a few people who were like,
[00:23:25.230] so 20 year reunion. And I was like, oh my God, like I didn't even think people would actually
[00:23:29.930] be down for a 20 year reunion. Like you said, by 20 years, you definitely feel more removed.
[00:23:36.710] Right. And you probably have even less contact with everyone.
[00:23:39.910] You know, like posting about this event on Facebook would not work out. Like probably
[00:23:44.950] no one is even checking that kind of stuff. Yeah. So I was surprised that some people were
[00:23:49.830] like, oh my God, like hopefully we'll have a 20 year reunion. It's like, dang. Okay.
[00:23:54.650] I guess we'll see what happens when the 20 year rolls around.
[00:23:58.370] Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if it'll be one of those things where people are more willing to come
[00:24:05.090] now that they're more removed. So then the participation spikes up or I could also see it
[00:24:09.950] going the inverse way where it's like, oh damn, that was a long time ago. Like this doesn't feel
[00:24:14.250] as relevant anymore. So then like less people show up.
[00:24:17.010] I would definitely expect less people to show up than, than for the 10 year. But I mean,
[00:24:21.690] you never know. So I guess we'll see what happens in 20 years. Like if anyone even puts it together,
[00:24:27.310] just because I hosted the 10 year reunion is not a commitment to me.
[00:24:33.670] You heard it here first. Someone else would have fucking step up in 10 years.
[00:24:39.630] Dude, it's crazy too, because I was also talking to my parents about reunions and whatnot.
[00:24:44.450] And I think my dad has gone to some, if he could potentially make it like, it's hard for our
[00:24:50.910] parents too, because they immigrated out of their countries. But recently my mom went to one of her
[00:24:57.890] reunions and it was an elementary school reunion. Whoa. I know. I was like, dude, do you even remember
[00:25:05.170] like who these people are? And she was like, well, it's different for us because they have,
[00:25:10.050] you know, a certain class or whatever that they spend like the whole day with and whatnot.
[00:25:13.770] But she remembers a couple of them and they have like the tea on what happened to people who like
[00:25:21.170] stayed back in their hometown and whatnot. So my mom was catching up on everything because she had
[00:25:25.830] moved out of her hometown after she got married. But I just thought that was pretty crazy.
[00:25:31.130] Wow. Elementary school. That's yeah, that is crazy.
[00:25:35.090] Dude, she said it was like less than 20 people.
[00:25:37.610] Although I will admit, maybe like having a smaller group to start with,
[00:25:43.770] so like, for example, your mom having elementary school reunion, I'm sure to even begin with,
[00:25:49.210] it was probably maybe like 50 or 60 people max, right? And then you said about 20 people ended up
[00:25:54.530] going. I feel like in those cases, it is definitely more gossipy because like you said,
[00:26:00.430] they're talking, there's so much more connected like, oh, I can tell this one of 50 person did not
[00:26:07.110] show up. What's the tea on them? More than likely someone who is there will have heard whispering
[00:26:13.610] or at least know a little bit about what's going on. But for like a big high school class like mine,
[00:26:19.970] where it's, you know, up to 500 people, you don't know everyone. Even if you think you might
[00:26:25.270] know everyone, you probably don't. That's like a lot of people to remember. And so it's harder to like
[00:26:31.730] pick out specific events or like questions to ask almost.
[00:26:36.290] Yeah, that's a good point. I think also like since we are all still fairly connected to high school
[00:26:44.190] people, you're not going to air out dirty laundry of the people that you're close with. Or, you know,
[00:26:50.510] you might not feel as comfortable sharing out to like a group of 150 people like the latest
[00:26:55.690] craziness that's been going on in your life. But if you're showing up to like your 30 year
[00:27:01.590] elementary school, dude, honestly, it's even more because my parents are like 60 something now.
[00:27:07.630] You're probably way more comfortable like sharing details on things that have happened.
[00:27:12.350] Yeah. But I will say I asked my mom, I was like, Oh my god, what's the gossip on your elementary
[00:27:16.110] school classmates? And she was like, dude, at our age, it's not gossip. It's like sad news about people
[00:27:22.570] getting sick or passing away. Or I guess the juiciest gossip is like divorce or something,
[00:27:28.910] which isn't necessarily fun news. So she was like, yeah, I was just like a little bit sad after,
[00:27:34.730] but I guess it was nice to connect with my elementary school friends. And I was like,
[00:27:39.610] Oh, okay. Doesn't sound very happy. Not what I was hoping to hear.
[00:27:45.170] Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:46.910] Dude, my parents have a reunion coming up next year. They're going back to China for it.
[00:27:52.150] Wait, that's so cute.
[00:27:53.430] Yeah, it's a college reunion. I think because their class is so much smaller. So I think it's like
[00:28:00.370] their department reunion kind of they majored in whatever. So it's like all the people in that year
[00:28:06.250] who took this major are reunionizing. And I think because it's like a smaller group, they almost feel
[00:28:15.350] more obligated to go. And so they're making the effort to like fly back to China next year and
[00:28:22.050] try to go to the reunion. Unless of course, logistically, it doesn't work out. But as
[00:28:26.470] of now, they're like, okay, we're blocking off these two months because it could be happening
[00:28:30.650] in between this time. And I was like, whoa, dedication.
[00:28:35.070] That is so cute, honestly. And I'm sure when they come in, everyone's like, oh my god,
[00:28:39.790] like all the way from California, USA.
[00:28:43.970] Yeah, like I wonder in that generation, how many people ended up immigrating out. It's probably
[00:28:50.270] really crazy then for like reunions to see these people who left the country come back
[00:28:56.130] and catch up with them.
[00:28:58.290] Oh, yeah, I'm sure. It's such a different experience too from us probably. But who knows,
[00:29:04.190] maybe in like a couple decades, we will be in similar positions.
[00:29:08.710] Okay, I have a question for us. Yeah. If you saw there was news about a 50 year high
[00:29:16.290] school reunion, would you go?
[00:29:19.690] Wait, 50 years? I need to do the math. I guess we would be like 68. Oh, I would totally go.
[00:29:25.270] Oh my god.
[00:29:26.230] Yeah.
[00:29:28.070] Okay, good to know.
[00:29:30.450] You're like, I'm not gonna plan the 20 year, but I'll plan the fucking 50 year.
[00:29:35.250] No, but also, you're right, because we'd be pretty old by then. And so we probably have
[00:29:40.350] like nothing else to do. Might as well go to the reunion.
[00:29:43.350] I think like once my kids are in college, like I'll go to all the reunions.
[00:29:50.130] Actually, someone came to our reunion and she was pregnant. And I was like, wow, like,
[00:29:54.350] thank you so much for coming. Even though you're pregnant, it's really nice to reconnect and see
[00:29:58.990] them. And it's kind of touching just to know like, oh, maybe our class does hold a special
[00:30:04.090] place in a lot of people's hearts, whether or not they admit it.
[00:30:08.070] Yeah, yeah. Wait, I totally just remembered someone brought a yearbook.
[00:30:13.150] Oh, that's right.
[00:30:13.750] And I remember people were like huddling around it, like flipping their pages and stuff. I was like,
[00:30:17.430] this is so fucking cute.
[00:30:18.690] Yeah. That's funny. I totally should have brought one. I'm literally from yearbook too.
[00:30:25.190] But once we got there, then I was like, oh, I should have brought a yearbook for everyone.
[00:30:30.090] Well, all in all, I thought it was very, very special and nice to attend your guys' high school
[00:30:35.070] reunion. Even though I'm not attending mine, I am excited for my friends to go and fill me in
[00:30:41.450] afterwards. Thanks for attending, Jisoo. I know I kind of forced you to.
[00:30:46.630] A mandatory attending.
[00:30:50.090] Well, it was really fun chatting about 10-year reunions, the concept of reunions,
[00:30:54.990] and kind of reminiscing about high school. And for our listeners out there, if you have any
[00:30:59.370] thoughts about reunion, I don't know what to call it, like reunion culture.
[00:31:04.070] Reunionizing, as we said earlier.
