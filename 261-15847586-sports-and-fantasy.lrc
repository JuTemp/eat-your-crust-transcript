[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_04]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo
[00:00:03.680] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jimin and I'm James
[00:00:16.140] [SPEAKER_05]: So today we have on one familiar voice and one new voice
[00:00:21.900] [SPEAKER_05]: You might recognize James from some prior episodes
[00:00:25.080] [SPEAKER_05]: And he is actually also my husband
[00:00:27.300] [SPEAKER_05]: And we also have on Jimin today
[00:00:29.740] [SPEAKER_05]: Who is Chrisals boyfriend
[00:00:33.210] [SPEAKER_05]: So we have on these two guests to talk about sports
[00:00:37.940] [SPEAKER_05]: And we're gonna be diving into how we like to watch sports, athletes we like etc
[00:00:44.340] [SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually pretty topical since we are a couple weeks deep into fantasy football right now
[00:00:50.540] [SPEAKER_04]: Lovely sport
[00:00:53.660] [SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off by talking about fantasy
[00:00:57.540] [SPEAKER_04]: This is Jeesoo and I is first year doing fantasy football with all the guys in our friend group
[00:01:04.540] [SPEAKER_04]: And it's quite the experience
[00:01:06.800] [SPEAKER_05]: Wait, it's like significantly more stressful than I thought it would be
[00:01:10.680] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm like worried every day and I feel like I don't have the knowledge to know what to look for
[00:01:15.460] [SPEAKER_05]: Like look into
[00:01:16.320] [SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just anxious with no like solution
[00:01:18.980] [SPEAKER_04]: Wait yeah, I played fantasy basketball and football is not the same
[00:01:24.440] [SPEAKER_04]: It is so different and usually I'm like
[00:01:27.540] [SPEAKER_04]: Kind of good at fantasy basketball
[00:01:30.260] [SPEAKER_04]: But like football dude, it's rough
[00:01:32.420] [SPEAKER_05]: I will say the punishment aspect is also a little bit scary
[00:01:36.480] [SPEAKER_05]: So and our league the loser
[00:01:38.360] [SPEAKER_05]: Both of the week and of the total league has to do a punishment
[00:01:43.220] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty scary
[00:01:45.460] [SPEAKER_04]: Our punishment is to take an ice at the end of the week
[00:01:48.640] [SPEAKER_04]: If you scored the least points out of the whole league and
[00:01:51.980] [SPEAKER_04]: I just bought a six pack of icees at this point
[00:01:56.120] [SPEAKER_05]: So James and Jim in what is it like for you guys to watch me and Chris all play because you guys have played fantasy football in the past right
[00:02:03.120] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of funny seeing
[00:02:04.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Beginners fall into like the same pitfalls we've run into in the beginning with like choosing based on what the stats they or like
[00:02:12.720] [SPEAKER_02]: Watching you guys get updated with like news and just freaking out with news. It's kind of funny
[00:02:17.740] [SPEAKER_01]: I would say like overreaction is extremely prevalent
[00:02:22.220] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think exercising patience is important for
[00:02:25.600] [SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy football. I think like watching Chris little play fancy basketball
[00:02:28.640] [SPEAKER_01]: She's very very good at that but sometimes they're different aspects to fantasy football where it's kind of like
[00:02:34.820] [SPEAKER_01]: You're like oh my god why is this happening? Like don't worry. It's okay. It's okay
[00:02:37.760] [SPEAKER_01]: Like it'll be fine and then she's depressed for the entire weekend
[00:02:41.840] [SPEAKER_05]: There's been many a text exchange between we and Chris so we were just lamenting about our team
[00:02:48.100] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it's so different too because football is just the weekend
[00:02:51.320] [SPEAKER_04]: Like Thursday Sunday Monday and then basketball is like every day
[00:02:55.140] [SPEAKER_04]: So it's easier to like make moves and more stats happen but football is like one and done
[00:03:01.500] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, football is definitely more like a buildup
[00:03:04.020] [SPEAKER_02]: You're building up towards just one part of that week, but then I feel like basketball is like a slow burn
[00:03:08.500] [SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's 82 games so
[00:03:10.420] [SPEAKER_02]: It almost feels like it matters less
[00:03:12.340] [SPEAKER_02]: But for football. It's like oh the weekend is
[00:03:15.260] [SPEAKER_02]: Extremely crucial yeah fantasy football is the first step to gambling. I think
[00:03:20.240] [SPEAKER_04]: That's true. Oh, yeah, I think football feels way more gambling than like basketball
[00:03:25.220] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because the stats almost don't matter
[00:03:27.940] [SPEAKER_05]: It's completely random anything could happen so I just think I didn't expect fantasy to be such an emotional experience
[00:03:35.060] [SPEAKER_05]: I knew drafting would be like intense so I was like prepared for that
[00:03:39.560] [SPEAKER_05]: I felt like the draft one fairly well for me and then afterwards I was like wait what the fuck
[00:03:44.420] [SPEAKER_05]: I actually have to give a shit every few days and like keep track of stats keep track of who's practicing
[00:03:50.400] [SPEAKER_05]: Like I did not think I would have to care about that
[00:03:53.800] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude Jesus first injury was brutal. Oh, yeah, those little stuff
[00:03:59.340] [SPEAKER_01]: Make you want to watch more football games
[00:04:02.480] [SPEAKER_01]: Especially the games with the players that you have on your team
[00:04:05.720] [SPEAKER_05]: So I did watch a couple of games in the last few weeks and I think watching it
[00:04:10.600] [SPEAKER_05]: Still like really don't know what's going on because the thing about fantasy football that I didn't know was I thought it would be like very straightforward
[00:04:17.760] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this player gets a touchdown you get six points or whatever the kicker made a goal
[00:04:23.700] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I don't even know what the play points would be actually
[00:04:26.340] [SPEAKER_05]: But if I realize it's not as straightforward because you have to look at like passes and stuff
[00:04:31.380] [SPEAKER_05]: And half the time I have no idea which number my players are or like who even cut the pass or whatever
[00:04:36.980] [SPEAKER_05]: So honestly when we watch football
[00:04:39.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like staring at it like what's going on and James is like okay, this is good for you
[00:04:43.060] [SPEAKER_05]: This is bad for you
[00:04:45.120] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I feel like I've been learning so much about football
[00:04:48.660] [SPEAKER_04]: Drafting and the first week of fantasy. I had a moment where I was like wait
[00:04:53.460] [SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't even know who is on the field like what is the team on the field and like who is playing and what are they doing?
[00:05:01.500] [SPEAKER_04]: And so I started a deep dive and now I'm like oh, I know football
[00:05:05.680] [SPEAKER_05]: I'll get their one
[00:05:07.920] [SPEAKER_05]: I think it is kind of an interesting experience though like having my own fantasy team and watching this sport
[00:05:13.720] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little bit more emotionally invested versus before
[00:05:17.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I just be like oh everyone is doing so great. And I'm like no don't fucking pass it to this
[00:05:22.620] [SPEAKER_05]: Pass it to my god. That's true
[00:05:24.900] [SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel like fantasy almost ruins the experience of a game
[00:05:28.800] [SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like your micro managing each person or each team and you're like you're doing well
[00:05:33.860] [SPEAKER_02]: But like not in the right places
[00:05:37.140] [SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're managing multiple teams and say you have like players playing against each other then you're just like
[00:05:42.140] [SPEAKER_01]: This is not enjoyable for me on either play
[00:05:44.620] [SPEAKER_05]: Or it's like if you have players on both teams and it's like their playing
[00:05:50.020] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm like like why want my defense to do well
[00:05:52.640] [SPEAKER_05]: But this quarterback on the opposite team also needs to get points
[00:05:56.140] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I get emotionally invested to my players. I'm like oh you know what?
[00:06:00.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like rooting for them
[00:06:01.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I believe in them like even if they were shitty like they're on my team like I'll believe in them
[00:06:06.640] [SPEAKER_04]: And then I get attached to them and then sometimes when people propose trades
[00:06:10.600] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like they have so much potential
[00:06:13.060] [SPEAKER_04]: How can I just let them go like that? How can I give up on them like that?
[00:06:18.020] [SPEAKER_05]: Even though you didn't draft your team cuties. You still feel that way
[00:06:21.760] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you have to believe in your team
[00:06:24.520] [SPEAKER_04]: I think true. So speaking of drafting team cuties. Do you all have a specific strategy for drafting?
[00:06:32.100] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when I draft I literally pull up a couple charts and then just go based off of like what other people are picking
[00:06:38.940] [SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like I don't follow the league close enough in the off season to understand
[00:06:44.960] [SPEAKER_02]: What each move is affecting each player so yeah, I just pick based on stats and then like prey
[00:06:49.900] [SPEAKER_02]: But then like usually in the middle I'll start to deviate from my plan and just randomly pick people
[00:06:53.940] [SPEAKER_02]: And so I can always see the point in my draft when I was like okay, I'm just gonna start drafting
[00:06:59.800] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I'm similar to James where you know for like certain
[00:07:04.280] [SPEAKER_01]: draft engines right they have a sort of a ranking based on average draft position
[00:07:08.780] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of like crowdsourcing how certain players have been drafted
[00:07:12.600] [SPEAKER_01]: I think I tend to go a lot on theory so like theoretically this player should excel
[00:07:17.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Based on the personnel or like the offensive scheme whatever but as we all know
[00:07:24.100] [SPEAKER_01]: Theory rarely carries over to real life and so right now I'm being burned by theory quite a bit
[00:07:29.680] [SPEAKER_04]: But fingers crossed that it eventually works out my original straw was to just draft the good looking players
[00:07:37.840] [SPEAKER_02]: It's a good stride would say like most of the good people are good looking
[00:07:42.120] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a correlation. I think
[00:07:44.140] [SPEAKER_04]: But sadly my draft pick position did not allow for that
[00:07:48.440] [SPEAKER_04]: So I just drafted kind of yeah similarly like the average position a player gets drafted up
[00:07:54.800] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I feel like the spreadsheets were definitely my base in terms of picking
[00:07:58.940] [SPEAKER_05]: But the tie breakers are like who's hotter and then also do I have an affiliation with the city?
[00:08:05.640] [SPEAKER_05]: I picked a lot of Dallas cowboys cuz I'm
[00:08:09.900] [SPEAKER_05]: Cuz I'm somewhat affiliated with Dallas now
[00:08:14.140] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I feel that too because in basketball there's like Canadian basketball players
[00:08:18.020] [SPEAKER_04]: So I like to draft Canadians if they fall to me or whatever
[00:08:21.720] [SPEAKER_04]: But in football there's like no Canadian team
[00:08:24.700] [SPEAKER_04]: There's not that many Canadian players either so I was like these all these names mean nothing to me
[00:08:29.760] [SPEAKER_04]: I just see a face and like words. Yeah
[00:08:33.120] [SPEAKER_05]: Also, I just want to put it out there like all the good looking football players that I was researching before the draft
[00:08:38.600] [SPEAKER_05]: ended up all being like defensive people and I was like wait where is Nick Bosa like where are all my linebackers?
[00:08:45.620] [SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I draft that?
[00:08:47.460] [SPEAKER_05]: So that was a bit unfair
[00:08:49.560] [SPEAKER_04]: So you mentioned this earlier G-Soo, but I think we also need to talk about the punishment aspect of fantasy
[00:08:55.980] [SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like it is a huge part of the culture and it's pretty insane because
[00:09:02.020] [SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy football and pretty sure is like the biggest fantasy sport so a lot of like cultural influence
[00:09:08.600] [SPEAKER_04]: Originates from football. I think the nature of these like
[00:09:13.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Punishments and how leagues are formed and just like funny and fun things that people do in their leagues
[00:09:20.560] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can talk about our punishment
[00:09:24.100] [SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy cuz it's like an iconic punishment and I've never heard about it until I learned more about fantasy football
[00:09:30.360] [SPEAKER_02]: The idea we had for our league for the punishment is that the last place person will go to a baseball game with other people in the league
[00:09:38.140] [SPEAKER_02]: And then they have to eat nine hot dogs and drink nine beers within the nine innings and it's called nine nine
[00:09:44.840] [SPEAKER_05]: Which is terrifying and also our league
[00:09:46.960] [SPEAKER_05]: It is 10 people before of us our girls. I was like I can see some of the guys completing it
[00:09:51.640] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we could do it
[00:09:53.540] [SPEAKER_01]: What's also funny is that baseball has actually tried to speed up the pace of play so you know originally
[00:09:59.780] [SPEAKER_01]: It was you know kind of doable but now you can see games ending in like under two hours
[00:10:04.740] [SPEAKER_02]: So that sort of adds pressure. Yeah, there's no way the thing is with fantasy football punishments
[00:10:10.080] [SPEAKER_02]: It's about the intent. I feel like if you tried your best to do it
[00:10:14.360] [SPEAKER_02]: It's totally fine. I would say the worst type of people in the world are the people who get last and then
[00:10:19.800] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't do the punishment or like do it half-assed
[00:10:23.880] [SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also crucial for the league slash the commissioner who kind of runs the league
[00:10:29.860] [SPEAKER_05]: I guess to pick a punishment that's doable and also like somewhat fun and enjoyable while doing it
[00:10:36.300] [SPEAKER_05]: Because some of the ones that were proposed in our league. I was like there's no way this is fun or doable
[00:10:42.060] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're some of the alternative punishments that were flooded around there was one that was like you have to
[00:10:48.850] [SPEAKER_05]: Panhandle on the street be like a street performer almost the only way you could end your punishment was to get
[00:10:55.290] [SPEAKER_05]: $100 and tips from people
[00:10:57.630] [SPEAKER_05]: There's also one that was like do like a stand-up comedian set at your local bar or whatever and I was like there's no way
[00:11:05.230] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to commit to something. I know I would back up
[00:11:08.170] [SPEAKER_04]: Did I saw this crazy one on Instagram? It was like go to the airport and you fly to whatever like the cheapest ticket available is and then you can't come home
[00:11:17.790] [SPEAKER_04]: Until you earn your tickets worth oh my god, that's wild. Yeah, I was like that's like what if they're there for like a year
[00:11:26.270] [SPEAKER_02]: I think another idea that was proposed which was like quickly shot down was to
[00:11:30.890] [SPEAKER_02]: Fly somewhere and then get home without flying
[00:11:34.190] [SPEAKER_02]: So we take like buses and stuff all the way home. That's pretty crazy
[00:11:39.330] [SPEAKER_04]: I think 99 nine nine all though it's like very scary
[00:11:44.470] [SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun because we can all go to the baseball game together
[00:11:47.690] [SPEAKER_04]: Right, right there's a group aspect but I do think Jim and had a funny one when he lost two years ago
[00:11:54.130] [SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for bringing that
[00:11:56.610] [SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago. I think there was sort of the iconic waffle house or eye-hop challenge the loser had to spend
[00:12:03.370] [SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours in one of those fine dining establishments in like the waffle house for instance for every
[00:12:09.370] [SPEAKER_01]: Waffle that was consumed an hour could get taken off of your stay in our league right we
[00:12:14.930] [SPEAKER_01]: Likewise right when the commissioner proposes a punishment we usually
[00:12:17.990] [SPEAKER_01]: Get the approval of the entire league to make sure everyone's in and so there's usually some adjustments for ours
[00:12:23.750] [SPEAKER_01]: We just sort of cut it down to 12 hours to make it more reasonable. Oh, wait really it was only 12
[00:12:29.390] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we only 12 hours. Yeah
[00:12:30.990] [SPEAKER_02]: You try you try sitting in a waffle house for 12 hours how many hours did you sit there and how many waffles did you end up eating so what's actually kind of messed up
[00:12:39.290] [SPEAKER_01]: There's no waffle houses in California. I had to fly home and do this
[00:12:43.970] [SPEAKER_01]: I had a fly back to Texas. I got into the waffle house at about 7 a.m. And I was there until 1.30 p.m
[00:12:50.430] [SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that's what I'm about
[00:12:52.250] [SPEAKER_01]: The sugar rush. I had six waffles wait is it six plates of waffles or six waffles? Well each waffle is the size of a plate
[00:13:01.430] [SPEAKER_01]: It was okay. That was all I ate
[00:13:05.010] [SPEAKER_01]: And then I had this like immense sugar rush and then crashed afterwards
[00:13:10.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Well was nice was like our friends came and visited me
[00:13:14.220] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it was like you know like they had come and and they helped do eat waffles. They didn't count towards the thing
[00:13:19.030] [SPEAKER_01]: They would just eat like there's like I'm here for lunch and then it would eat something
[00:13:22.750] [SPEAKER_01]: Like the rest of the food look pretty good, but I actually only eat waffles. Oh, okay. Yeah
[00:13:27.650] [SPEAKER_01]: I did feel kind of bad because like the waitress was kind of like why are you still
[00:13:32.310] [SPEAKER_04]: So I had to make sure to tip her very generous as well. You should have put up a sign like I lost my fantasy week
[00:13:38.610] [SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, yeah that would have been like helpful sign or something. I mean, yeah
[00:13:43.150] [SPEAKER_01]: I found it really hard to explain to her why I was there the whole time
[00:13:45.850] [SPEAKER_01]: But she like graciously moved me to like a corner so I wasn't like blocking you know other patrons and stuff
[00:13:51.450] [SPEAKER_01]: So it was um it was interesting. I would definitely go back just not for 12 hours
[00:13:57.810] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I feel like six hours not that bad. Yeah, I feel like seven to one is like I don't know
[00:14:03.510] [SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't sound that bad yeah, watch a couple movies
[00:14:05.890] [SPEAKER_01]: So there's no internet there. That's the thing right you know like you don't have internet
[00:14:10.030] [SPEAKER_04]: But you have your phone right there's no signal either. Oh no signal. There was like one bar
[00:14:14.470] [SPEAKER_01]: So actually fun fact that was the day so I played golf too and so Taylor made which is a golf brand and kith
[00:14:20.770] [SPEAKER_01]: The New York Street brim dropped their first collab and I was extremely mad because I'm sitting in the waffle house
[00:14:26.350] [SPEAKER_01]: With one bar of signal and I could not get anything
[00:14:30.070] [SPEAKER_01]: So my friends had to like proxy it for me, but I was just sitting there like dude nothing's loading like
[00:14:35.150] [SPEAKER_01]: I can't watch anything so that was like the extra layer of torch
[00:14:39.650] [SPEAKER_01]: But on the plus side the waffle house was a nice neighborhood so it's not like those icon you know
[00:14:43.670] [SPEAKER_01]: Those like videos you see like those world star
[00:14:46.150] [SPEAKER_04]: The waffle house scene. So there's a trade off there. Okay, but would you rather sit in like a world star
[00:14:52.630] [SPEAKER_04]: waffle house with great internet or in a nicer waffle house with no internet
[00:14:59.550] [SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I'd probably still take the nice one because I was like I can get some reading done
[00:15:02.950] [SPEAKER_01]: I was working on this like thermodynamic theory thing for for grad school and so I actually had to like sit down and
[00:15:08.670] [SPEAKER_01]: derive something and so it worked out
[00:15:10.970] [SPEAKER_01]: I see but like if I didn't probably the world star because I couldn't just like stream it and then people
[00:15:16.170] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I will say I feel like these punishments like the waffle house one nine nine nine or iconic because they're
[00:15:23.130] [SPEAKER_05]: So bad like I've also seen some simple or ones
[00:15:26.190] [SPEAKER_05]: I think I saw like some guy drive in a car and his license plate
[00:15:31.050] [SPEAKER_05]: Border thing just said ice like at fantasy football
[00:15:33.550] [SPEAKER_05]: I was like that's not a bad punishment at all
[00:15:36.270] [SPEAKER_04]: All right, and then didn't like James your cousin do one was just like had to wear black shoes for the year. Yeah
[00:15:42.090] [SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think he has a wear like black Air Force ones for an entire calendar year or something
[00:15:47.050] [SPEAKER_01]: No, we cut that down to we only cut it to like I think like a quarter or something
[00:15:51.810] [SPEAKER_01]: That's not even bad. I know I feel like he got off like Scott free
[00:15:56.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Like we only like did a random shoe check maybe four times on him too
[00:16:01.590] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because whatever we see him out we're just like Chris
[00:16:04.190] [SPEAKER_01]: Shoot check like you know like and he has to send a picture of his shoes
[00:16:08.070] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he's like wearing them. I did notice the league that yeah, Jim and Chris are in they're very generous with punishments at the end
[00:16:16.790] [SPEAKER_02]: Cuz yeah, I don't want to call anyone out
[00:16:18.970] [SPEAKER_02]: But we our punishment was nine nine nine last year and it was it was not completed
[00:16:23.970] [SPEAKER_02]: It was
[00:16:25.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Somebody did like a five hot dogs and four beers to add up to nine that doesn't cut it
[00:16:32.050] [SPEAKER_01]: But these are sort of like the season you know this season long
[00:16:35.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Challenges does your league have sort of like you know in the league that James and I
[00:16:39.510] [SPEAKER_01]: And we sort of also have like random side quests that sort of added to the punishment
[00:16:43.010] [SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have
[00:16:44.210] [SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned one right without there any others that
[00:16:47.270] [SPEAKER_01]: Or do you want to elaborate maybe on your side quest ones?
[00:16:50.310] [SPEAKER_04]: So are league is heavily influenced off of your league Jim and so yeah, I think if a player score zero on your active
[00:16:58.010] [SPEAKER_04]: Line up that's an ice and then the one I mentioned earlier
[00:17:01.730] [SPEAKER_04]: Which is if your team scores the least points that week then that's also an ice
[00:17:05.970] [SPEAKER_04]: I think those are like the only established ones right now
[00:17:08.610] [SPEAKER_05]: There were a couple other ones on our pose, but I feel like the more complicated it is the less likely we can like truly enforce it
[00:17:15.610] [SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a good middle ground. We had a really funny one though
[00:17:18.590] [SPEAKER_04]: There's like a lot of couples in our league and then I was against our other friend Katie on week one
[00:17:25.570] [SPEAKER_04]: My team was shooting the bed and Katie's team was like popping off and then we didn't know this
[00:17:31.230] [SPEAKER_04]: But her boyfriend, Avi who's also in the league. He took her phone and wrote wow
[00:17:36.710] [SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be a close one at Crystal and everyone was like
[00:17:40.330] [SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit like Katie is insane like she's talking and then later Avi confesses like oh
[00:17:46.910] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I should confess it was actually me who did that and we were like okay
[00:17:50.230] [SPEAKER_04]: That deserves an ice
[00:17:51.790] [SPEAKER_02]: Just punishable fraud. Yeah
[00:17:53.830] [SPEAKER_05]: Egregiousness is punishable. Yeah, I thought oh so crazy too is Avi literally was like that's my girl
[00:17:59.290] [SPEAKER_05]: My baby and I was like wow looking back that's actually a stunner
[00:18:04.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Looking back he was typing that on his other hand. Yeah left hand right
[00:18:08.390] [SPEAKER_02]: Should they like un-sportsman like condo?
[00:18:11.170] [SPEAKER_04]: That's wild. It's crazy too because last week his team was popping off and he used the exact same line just on his account
[00:18:19.950] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think in our league so like James your cousin
[00:18:23.610] [SPEAKER_01]: I feel like he just wants people to drink
[00:18:25.910] [SPEAKER_01]: So last year I went home to like visit and a couple of high school friends we got together
[00:18:30.790] [SPEAKER_01]: They're like we just hung out to play like many golf and somehow that turned into a competition where the loser got like a couple of
[00:18:36.490] [SPEAKER_01]: Ises tacked their season long tally. Yeah, I think Chris was trying to like move on other people
[00:18:42.070] [SPEAKER_01]: But then he ended up getting it for himself nice
[00:18:45.610] [SPEAKER_01]: That contravises his year end six pack. Oh my god. I will say though
[00:18:49.850] [SPEAKER_05]: I think fantasy is like fostering a big sense of community for me
[00:18:53.410] [SPEAKER_05]: Which we always talk about oh yeah, I mean one every year before this the Super Bowl would come around and I'd always be like
[00:18:59.590] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was playing in it like I would never know and now I feel like watching football
[00:19:03.970] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm like
[00:19:04.950] [SPEAKER_05]: Invested and who's winning or not
[00:19:07.450] [SPEAKER_04]: You're like if my player doesn't want to get on the Super Bowl. He needs to get off my
[00:19:11.430] [SPEAKER_05]: Get off my roster exactly like I could pull up to work and be like oh my god crazy that Cooper cuff got injured like dropping names
[00:19:19.130] [SPEAKER_05]: Being all broy so there's some like other benefits to playing fantasy. I think yeah
[00:19:25.070] [SPEAKER_01]: I think it sometimes also serves as sort of that third setting that people
[00:19:29.210] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of need you have home you have work and then I think in this like post pandemic
[00:19:34.710] [SPEAKER_01]: You're still coming out of this like looking for that third setting and sometimes like a fantasy leak
[00:19:40.050] [SPEAKER_01]: And almost be like that because
[00:19:41.710] [SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the leak has people you don't really otherwise meet or talk to right and so that sort of brings like another third
[00:19:47.410] [SPEAKER_04]: Group that you can hang out with but that's true like our league right now is
[00:19:52.910] [SPEAKER_04]: Both coasts and so we're like communicating more with some of our friends who we don't see as often because they're like in the east coast and it's pretty nice
[00:20:01.550] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's like really bonding. I guess is it trauma bonding
[00:20:06.040] [SPEAKER_04]: That kind of yeah, I was definitely trauma bonding yeah, and I guess the 999 whoever does it
[00:20:12.330] [SPEAKER_04]: We'll also be trauma bonding yeah
[00:20:14.350] [SPEAKER_04]: It is just like looming over us
[00:20:18.850] [SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully my players remember that they play football
[00:20:22.310] [SPEAKER_02]: That they're paid to playing
[00:20:25.190] [SPEAKER_05]: Well moving a little bit away from fantasy
[00:20:28.430] [SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about general sports and I kind of want to open up this segment by talking about sports philosophy
[00:20:35.070] [SPEAKER_05]: Which james and I were discussing yesterday and I think a big part of sports philosophy is kind of like what kind of fan are you?
[00:20:43.170] [SPEAKER_05]: And like what are you invested into?
[00:20:45.630] [SPEAKER_05]: For example, some people are really into teams and are like die hard
[00:20:50.150] [SPEAKER_05]: Lakers fans or whatever other people are more into the players of the player moves teams
[00:20:55.570] [SPEAKER_05]: They're more likely to follow that new team that they're a part of other people like to watch
[00:21:00.610] [SPEAKER_05]: Every single game while some people really just watch like the highlights rules. So I guess for you guys as sports fans
[00:21:07.050] [SPEAKER_05]: That sports watchers
[00:21:08.470] [SPEAKER_05]: What are you more into like what do you prioritize?
[00:21:11.230] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when I was young I used to
[00:21:14.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Watch every game
[00:21:16.350] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't have the time and like my team's not doing that well
[00:21:21.590] [SPEAKER_02]: So I don't watch like every game. I'll just check in like every few weeks just to see how they're doing
[00:21:27.130] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think I overall I like teams that win because when you're a kid you're when you're choosing teams
[00:21:32.210] [SPEAKER_02]: You're like okay, I'm just gonna pick the people who keep winning every year
[00:21:35.630] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I chose my teams. I'm sort of the opposite. I love mediocrity for some reasons
[00:21:40.330] [SPEAKER_01]: So I always root for the underdog
[00:21:42.290] [SPEAKER_01]: Also like growing up for instance
[00:21:44.550] [SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of my childhood friends were like Lakers fans and I was just like who was the last team to like beat the Lakers?
[00:21:51.270] [SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like those the kings. I'm like I don't know who they are, but they're my team
[00:21:55.490] [SPEAKER_01]: No, you know that kind of thing
[00:21:57.470] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so then now like I follow a different team that is you know also not very good
[00:22:01.890] [SPEAKER_01]: But I'll check in on them every now and then just to see how things are
[00:22:06.030] [SPEAKER_04]: I try to go by like a city that means something to me
[00:22:10.490] [SPEAKER_04]: So it's easy to like root for the Canadian team in like basketball other than that
[00:22:16.210] [SPEAKER_04]: I started to like certain players from fantasy and then that kind of made me like their team as well
[00:22:22.230] [SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of insane, but like when I was playing fantasy basketball
[00:22:26.110] [SPEAKER_04]: I would literally watch any game that had at least one of my players in it and
[00:22:31.790] [SPEAKER_04]: That's how you win
[00:22:33.430] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah
[00:22:34.790] [SPEAKER_04]: That's dedication
[00:22:36.390] [SPEAKER_01]: Just watch spoke on like a true champ
[00:22:39.990] [SPEAKER_04]: But it was fun and I think it's also fun in the beginning too because then you're like really picking up quickly
[00:22:45.750] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I used to only follow basketball very casually not really keeping up with anything
[00:22:50.790] [SPEAKER_04]: But then fantasy kind of forces you to keep up with it a lot more
[00:22:55.250] [SPEAKER_04]: So you have to know what's going on like what players are injured by the end of like the first season of
[00:23:00.990] [SPEAKER_04]: fantasy basketball I would be like naming certain players and people are like who the hell like I like don't know what you're saying
[00:23:10.190] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I think I don't have the like a tensions fan to do that and just fundamentally
[00:23:15.290] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that into sports to be honest, but I'm like a big highlights real person
[00:23:20.230] [SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like I have access to so much content because everything is new to me
[00:23:24.850] [SPEAKER_05]: For example a couple months ago James was showing me
[00:23:28.270] [SPEAKER_05]: Rearving highlight and I was like this man is amazing
[00:23:32.070] [SPEAKER_05]: And then I started to get all conflicted on like well he has all these like weird philosophies right that I don't
[00:23:37.950] [SPEAKER_05]: More or less agree with so am I more into like the art like can I separate the art from the artist kind of thing
[00:23:44.730] [SPEAKER_05]: And I think to an extent I like kind of can
[00:23:47.190] [SPEAKER_05]: To me like highlight reals are a big thing because then I don't have to watch other bits where they're like not playing that well
[00:23:53.090] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I started to realize I was like yeah fantasy basketball is just like really
[00:23:58.090] [SPEAKER_04]: Taking off so much time. So I had been thinking about quitting for a while and then this year was a perfect excuse
[00:24:04.010] [SPEAKER_02]: Only to join another fan
[00:24:05.750] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was thinking like football is less of a commitment right but now I'm like do don't I'm like stressing
[00:24:13.070] [SPEAKER_01]: Do the minute this season started?
[00:24:14.970] [SPEAKER_01]: I have the Twitter notifications on for like you know all the player updates and I've noticed my
[00:24:19.630] [SPEAKER_01]: Fulon battery usage has just like increased dramatically
[00:24:23.010] [SPEAKER_01]: The minute like that first Sunday hit my phone just like
[00:24:26.320] [SPEAKER_05]: It's too much. Yeah, I think there was a Sunday a couple weeks ago where we were golfing and crystals team was not doing so hot
[00:24:33.060] [SPEAKER_05]: So she pulled up to the game like already being like I need a drink and then towards the end when we were heading to dinner
[00:24:38.860] [SPEAKER_05]: She was so depressed like we need to do it well this check all this girl
[00:24:43.480] [SPEAKER_01]: She texted me she's like I'm gonna be depressed until the superbook
[00:24:47.500] [SPEAKER_05]: At least 16 weeks
[00:24:51.380] [SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry you'll be done being depressed by the time play awesome
[00:24:54.980] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jesus like I will point does fantasy become fun. I was like
[00:24:58.940] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't know like maybe in like 14 more weeks
[00:25:01.840] [SPEAKER_04]: Like when it ends my goal isn't even to win. It's just like not lose
[00:25:07.100] [SPEAKER_04]: I think another fun aspect of following sports though is that it's actually very very drama filled
[00:25:13.880] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like reality TV Loki and like I thought the NBA was a bunch of divas but dude football is crazy
[00:25:21.860] [SPEAKER_04]: People are just sitting out like yeah, you're not gonna pay me
[00:25:25.400] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not gonna play even though they're like still on a contract and then one of the players Tyre Kill
[00:25:31.680] [SPEAKER_04]: pulled up week one to his game and he literally got arrested for like shitty driving or something
[00:25:37.300] [SPEAKER_04]: And then he shows up for the game and people are like damn that's dedication
[00:25:41.860] [SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's crazy like he scored a touchdown that game and his celebration was him getting handcuffs
[00:25:47.660] [SPEAKER_02]: It's wild and it's a wild west and then if I'll like you can kind of just do whatever and like yeah
[00:25:53.060] [SPEAKER_02]: The fact that people just sit out games is crazy because like you only play a few times a year
[00:25:57.160] [SPEAKER_02]: So like you sitting out is like in the NBA the equivalent of like sitting out like 10 games or something
[00:26:02.480] [SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think I'd like to follow the athletes who are like really drama filled
[00:26:06.620] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm like this is a little much for me. I think I like the kind of
[00:26:10.100] [SPEAKER_05]: Goody two shoes, you know, they just have like a really chill hobby or something
[00:26:15.380] [SPEAKER_05]: In the NBA kind of like the Austin Reeves liberal on type of people
[00:26:19.120] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean LeBron doesn't really have that much drama, right? No really yeah
[00:26:22.700] [SPEAKER_05]: I like stay away from the tight re-cows
[00:26:25.260] [SPEAKER_04]: Sports, I think yeah agreed that's actually kind of a drafting strategy
[00:26:30.700] [SPEAKER_04]: At least in basketball like I would try to draft the wholesome people because then they wouldn't sit out games
[00:26:35.620] [SPEAKER_04]: necessarily because of whatever drama that they're like
[00:26:39.340] [SPEAKER_04]: involved in or like you know they're not out partying and then you're like oh they play like really bad this day
[00:26:45.380] [SPEAKER_04]: Like are they okay?
[00:26:48.040] [SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how fantasy morphs what you think of people to sometimes the player will be like
[00:26:53.540] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm not playing because I'm having a kid this week. Oh, yeah, and I'm like
[00:26:58.780] [SPEAKER_02]: Happy for you man, but
[00:27:01.260] [SPEAKER_02]: Maybe come back earlier
[00:27:04.880] [SPEAKER_04]: No, but the good thing is at least I don't know if this is true in football
[00:27:08.180] [SPEAKER_04]: But whenever someone has a kid in basketball
[00:27:11.100] [SPEAKER_04]: Once they come back they literally are like a god for a week straight dad buff baby
[00:27:16.200] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean Tyre killed like five kids last year so that they're my my correlate
[00:27:21.280] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's great. She was great last year
[00:27:23.260] [SPEAKER_05]: I also will say I dislike people who have bad sportsmanship like on the court. Oh, yeah
[00:27:30.000] [SPEAKER_05]: Like Dreymon Green people like that. I just can't do yeah very polarizing yes
[00:27:35.920] [SPEAKER_02]: Dirty players know him. I like the strong and silent type of players
[00:27:41.760] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I like notable personalities like someone who is either super intense and and quiet or like
[00:27:48.620] [SPEAKER_02]: Extremely loud, but it's like really good. I'm like drawn to that as well. I mean, I don't know
[00:27:53.720] [SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm just like turned off by cockiness for example like James Harden
[00:27:58.060] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like can have a lot of sass on the court sometimes. I'm like I don't really like that
[00:28:03.700] [SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy because I feel like there's people who are way sassing over that
[00:28:08.540] [SPEAKER_01]: I would not say James Harden come back
[00:28:10.940] [SPEAKER_04]: But I think I still love knowledge is very small
[00:28:14.600] [SPEAKER_04]: It's like James Harden tilted his head once and Jesus like oh, I don't like yeah
[00:28:18.460] [SPEAKER_04]: I was like that's gonna be a no
[00:28:21.080] [SPEAKER_01]: That's attitude
[00:28:22.800] [SPEAKER_04]: Has like a okay, but I like Luke. Oh, yeah, oh
[00:28:26.360] [SPEAKER_02]: Patrick Beverly oh, yeah
[00:28:28.440] [SPEAKER_04]: God dude is like a man is on the court. All right
[00:28:31.320] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like yeah, what people don't like are people who are super loud but are not good players
[00:28:36.460] [SPEAKER_02]: Like Patrick Beverly or a dream on green Dylan Brooks
[00:28:40.460] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, true a lot of people who like talk a lot, but don't show up. Yeah. Okay, so now that we like kind of no sports a little more
[00:28:49.040] [SPEAKER_01]: Great primer
[00:28:51.780] [SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any like favorite sports to watch? Yes, I please kind of
[00:28:56.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Growing up like high through high school and college, so that's like one of my
[00:29:00.500] [SPEAKER_01]: Sort of top sports. I enjoy watching I like watching golf too
[00:29:04.140] [SPEAKER_01]: Personally playing it is more fun than watching but watching it is also really cool
[00:29:08.300] [SPEAKER_01]: And then of course like basketball football those things
[00:29:11.400] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think like I think tennis is like one of the more fun sports that you can really get into
[00:29:15.480] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't mind also shamelessly plugging like men's volleyball
[00:29:18.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Also very fun to watch it's very like fast-paced
[00:29:22.580] [SPEAKER_02]: But not that popular, so
[00:29:25.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Do any Olympics though? I remember watching like the Olympic one and I was like there was insane. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:30.260] [SPEAKER_02]: They're all jumping like insane amounts. Yeah, if you like watching the NBA like watching dunkstens stuff
[00:29:35.500] [SPEAKER_02]: It's like basically that every play
[00:29:37.320] [SPEAKER_05]: I think growing up if I were to watch a sports game it would be because
[00:29:41.880] [SPEAKER_05]: Corrio is playing in like a big sports game or something
[00:29:44.240] [SPEAKER_05]: I watch a lot of soccer and
[00:29:46.340] [SPEAKER_05]: Baseball actually and to this day I think I kind of enjoy watching those games
[00:29:50.800] [SPEAKER_05]: Basketball has been like a new thing for me to watch
[00:29:53.360] [SPEAKER_05]: I think I'd like how fast-paced it is and in contrast is something like soccer
[00:29:57.200] [SPEAKER_05]: You just have so many more points of mass
[00:29:59.560] [SPEAKER_05]: So it's always exciting. I don't know. I'm still on the fence about football
[00:30:03.080] [SPEAKER_05]: Like I don't even think it's enjoyable for me to watch yet
[00:30:06.700] [SPEAKER_05]: But you know I'm getting that I'm trying to watch some highlights reals to see like what is a good play and what is bad right?
[00:30:12.400] [SPEAKER_05]: Right, but I even like get my head around it a little bit
[00:30:14.840] [SPEAKER_04]: I think I can agree. I generally like more fast-paced things so like basketball is pretty fun
[00:30:21.800] [SPEAKER_04]: I also like swimming
[00:30:24.200] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, especially like a limpic swimming
[00:30:26.920] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess I've been getting more into tennis because of Jimin it was surprisingly fun. I was like oh
[00:30:32.200] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I see the like hype
[00:30:33.720] [SPEAKER_04]: This fence here
[00:30:35.340] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't like they're like moaning in time
[00:30:37.480] [SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like that's a lot wait that's like the best part
[00:30:41.980] [SPEAKER_04]: There's this one girl we were watching one time
[00:30:44.840] [SPEAKER_04]: Her grunt was like wait or like dude. She's literally like more you on the corner
[00:30:51.260] [SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Yelena Austin
[00:30:53.740] [SPEAKER_04]: And then there was like this match we were watching at the US open this year
[00:30:58.700] [SPEAKER_04]: The guy was just like silent. I think it was Medvedev
[00:31:01.860] [SPEAKER_04]: He was like not grunting at all and then this young guy up against him was like grunting and I was like damn Medvedev is just like so quiet
[00:31:08.820] [SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't even want to root for him in real life right now
[00:31:11.280] [SPEAKER_04]: I'm like I'll root for the young dude who's putting in the effort
[00:31:15.100] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the grunting is so performative you know
[00:31:19.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I also like have not really played tennis but I like the quiet people. Yeah
[00:31:23.900] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm just surprised they can keep it up for two hours of grunting
[00:31:27.600] [SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel like that's
[00:31:29.180] [SPEAKER_05]: Extremely draining. I also wonder sometimes if they like perfect their mode. Oh, how do I make it sound more cool or like sound less annoying?
[00:31:37.440] [SPEAKER_04]: And they like shape it at home. I don't know. Do you grant one you play tennis?
[00:31:41.280] [SPEAKER_01]: Just when I'm making fun of people. Oh, but I think it does serve as sort of like a metronom almost sometimes it helps with their rhythm
[00:31:47.820] [SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing sometimes they just do it to like fuck with other people
[00:31:51.980] [SPEAKER_01]: I really like joke a bitch like on on the court and this is some of his off-course stuff not so much
[00:31:56.640] [SPEAKER_01]: But he can either be very quiet or he can also like run depending on like the level of intensity
[00:32:02.480] [SPEAKER_04]: Just strategy
[00:32:04.020] [SPEAKER_02]: Wow, so if you're playing him and he's not grunting it's just like mental mental damage
[00:32:08.640] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's not like rough in a doll right is very much yelling when he plays and sure
[00:32:14.440] [SPEAKER_01]: I think fatter is like dead quiet like occasionally
[00:32:17.240] [SPEAKER_01]: He makes like a little grunt of exertion and joke of it just like kind of in the middle where he's like you can hear him like making some noise
[00:32:24.640] [SPEAKER_01]: But not too much
[00:32:25.920] [SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of perfecting your grunt when I was like he had I used to practice the dolls grunt
[00:32:30.840] [SPEAKER_02]: I have it down like it's really good
[00:32:36.520] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah
[00:32:37.080] [SPEAKER_02]: And he does the double club twirl into a spot scratch
[00:32:42.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Into a spot scratch yeah, he always scratches but every every play. Yeah, so if you watch him play
[00:32:48.720] [SPEAKER_01]: He has a he has a very fixed routine
[00:32:51.160] [SPEAKER_01]: So he like he's bouncing it he picks that his ass like twice
[00:32:56.260] [SPEAKER_01]: In tennis because you switch sides every couple games
[00:32:59.160] [SPEAKER_01]: He always has two water bottles and the labels will face whatever side he's on so keep always adjusted
[00:33:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Super OCD he's very OCD
[00:33:07.020] [SPEAKER_01]: We just a hair thing too, right?
[00:33:09.220] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's a lot of like
[00:33:13.040] [SPEAKER_05]: Super sticiousness and neuroticness
[00:33:15.580] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's like you always hear about the
[00:33:18.340] [SPEAKER_05]: Pre-game routines with like the chalk or whatever
[00:33:21.000] [SPEAKER_05]: I feel like golfers will also have like a long set of routine which I'm always like oh my god, it's so fascinating dude
[00:33:27.400] [SPEAKER_04]: I think is it Patrick Mahomes who's who's like I only wear one pair of underwear for like any game
[00:33:34.460] [SPEAKER_04]: He's lucky under a
[00:33:36.200] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's because professional sports is rooted in like routine because like you can't go through a full season
[00:33:41.820] [SPEAKER_02]: Without having like a set schedule every day especially when you're that like rich and famous to
[00:33:47.400] [SPEAKER_02]: You need to find time to just like have your like consistent routine
[00:33:50.720] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they travel a lot too. Actually. Yeah, I noticed like I was at a pro golf tournament the other day
[00:33:56.880] [SPEAKER_01]: And just one player he was like teeing off the drive or whatever and there was no one in the way
[00:34:01.560] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think there was like maybe one volunteer who thought that they were standing out of the way or something
[00:34:06.540] [SPEAKER_01]: And the guy is caddy and this happened like twice down around would just ask them to like move ever
[00:34:11.060] [SPEAKER_01]: Slightly in a direction and to me I felt like oh there's makes no difference but to the
[00:34:15.700] [SPEAKER_01]: Gulf or I think they made like the world of difference in terms of like
[00:34:19.160] [SPEAKER_01]: Maybe his spatial perception or something so it's like very like down to those details. You know
[00:34:24.860] [SPEAKER_05]: They're devils
[00:34:26.680] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like pro sports like a lot of athletes have OCD yeah, that's how they can play hours without getting bored of it too
[00:34:33.840] [SPEAKER_04]: I feel like there's like this one guy Westbrook who always eats like a pvn jv
[00:34:39.160] [SPEAKER_04]: Poor games
[00:34:40.700] [SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone else also like just throw up before a big game? Wait, well, yeah a lot of players
[00:34:44.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Storping the bathroom before the play. No, I think a Michael Jordan you said throw up like before a lot of his games
[00:34:50.520] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god really?
[00:34:52.060] [SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like nerves I guess. Yeah, well, I think it was Josh Allen who throws it like oh
[00:34:57.440] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so I think so oh so it's like performance dude
[00:35:01.440] [SPEAKER_04]: Josh Allen is a great quarter
[00:35:03.340] [SPEAKER_05]: You went through fantasy
[00:35:06.740] [SPEAKER_04]: So I need to get some some players who throw up before their games new checklist vomit her
[00:35:14.320] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a funny question for us all
[00:35:16.760] [SPEAKER_04]: What sport do you think produces the best bodes?
[00:35:21.320] [SPEAKER_02]: I think it's soccer for men like there's no there's no question. I feel like it might be football
[00:35:26.380] [SPEAKER_05]: football like defensive football players. Okay
[00:35:31.500] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know the right terminology, but you know yeah
[00:35:35.040] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like football tends to create like at least for the positions you're talking about like some very like lean
[00:35:40.160] [SPEAKER_02]: muscular giant bodies. Oh like linebackers their lean defensive ends. Yeah
[00:35:46.620] [SPEAKER_02]: Lineback they're lean for their um size like they're not lean people for sure
[00:35:51.620] [SPEAKER_01]: I mean they're like like six eight to you know two twenty two thirty like oh
[00:35:56.240] [SPEAKER_01]: Okay, oh muscle. Oh muscle. Yeah. It's like very little body fat
[00:35:58.880] [SPEAKER_04]: Damn. She's who likes muscular guys. I think so. I think I'm into like chesty dude
[00:36:02.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Awesome. Not soccer because soccer produces no chest. Yeah. Okay
[00:36:07.800] [SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly Jim and said that tennis players also don't have chest
[00:36:12.440] [SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like disruptive to their swing. Oh
[00:36:15.860] [SPEAKER_02]: But their farmers tend is crazy. Their tans are insane
[00:36:20.880] [SPEAKER_04]: Golf and tennis tans are crazy
[00:36:23.380] [SPEAKER_01]: The golf hat 10 is absurd when they take off their hats like shake hands
[00:36:28.100] [SPEAKER_01]: It's just like that's a band of whites
[00:36:32.600] [SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of tens I think swimming produces good bodies
[00:36:37.060] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh I actually don't think like I don't think I agree personally
[00:36:40.980] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like summer's bodies are a little too wide at the top and a little too skinny in the middle
[00:36:46.380] [SPEAKER_02]: Dreaders. Yeah, it's like a exactly streamed
[00:36:48.700] [SPEAKER_04]: But aren't football players Doritos?
[00:36:51.140] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I think because they have more muscle at the bottom still
[00:36:54.880] [SPEAKER_05]: It kind of balances out a little bit and I think I don't know so members have like long torso
[00:37:00.160] [SPEAKER_05]: Right like I feel like that's beneficial to being against women. Yeah, and I'm not as into that
[00:37:04.560] [SPEAKER_01]: The proportions are different. Yeah, I would say like tennis players I think of pretty good physics for the most part
[00:37:11.120] [SPEAKER_01]: But I agree with James as well like men's soccer like when they take off their shirts it is quite despactical
[00:37:18.720] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think soccer makes sense because they run a lot and I feel like runners legs are like nice
[00:37:25.020] [SPEAKER_02]: Cardio specific and sports like soccer or tennis
[00:37:28.320] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very lean. I actually saw some videos of like soccer like just teams like the players doing their training
[00:37:35.300] [SPEAKER_01]: Not just practicing on the field but also the off-field training like in the gym and stuff
[00:37:39.720] [SPEAKER_01]: And they do a lot more explosive work than I thought and I think that also promotes you know like muscle growth
[00:37:44.840] [SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at track and feel all right all the sprinters are generally very muscular as well
[00:37:49.200] [SPEAKER_01]: Because they work on so much of the explosive stuff and so I think that helps soccer players
[00:37:53.240] [SPEAKER_01]: They both have that both that explosive like physique as well as the endurance from running for
[00:37:59.160] [SPEAKER_05]: Well kind of continuing this conversation of like best buds. Who do you think are your personal all-time hottest athletes?
[00:38:07.240] [SPEAKER_02]: I think for men it's
[00:38:08.900] [SPEAKER_02]: easily
[00:38:11.020] [SPEAKER_02]: Ronaldo probably yeah, I can't really think of anyone else who would be brought up that quickly
[00:38:15.980] [SPEAKER_04]: I guess yeah, he's like so famous back on Olivia's erode
[00:38:20.700] [SPEAKER_01]: He's a French striker. He's an MLS now. I saw him for the first time in the world cup
[00:38:24.780] [SPEAKER_01]: Also sure less and I was like whoa
[00:38:28.120] [SPEAKER_05]: I'm something a pattern
[00:38:30.080] [SPEAKER_01]: But his hair is fantastic. I was like how do you run for a whole neck?
[00:38:34.180] [SPEAKER_01]: Your hair is just like intact. I don't know like French soccer players something just something about it
[00:38:38.900] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this is like the thing where when guys start working out to like get girls
[00:38:43.200] [SPEAKER_04]: But then only guys
[00:38:46.940] [SPEAKER_05]: So true
[00:38:48.960] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this might be personally biased but speaking of good hair, Luca, Don Church and his good hair
[00:38:54.520] [SPEAKER_02]: Was pretty hot like when he was a rookie. Mm-hmm. That's true
[00:38:58.480] [SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what his hair was oh my god
[00:39:00.320] [SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna pull it up when he used to actually do his hair that dude's got that dude goes like super cuts now
[00:39:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't think he gets hair cuts now
[00:39:07.380] [SPEAKER_01]: I think like his wife is my husband's cut this
[00:39:10.960] [SPEAKER_05]: Also lip bronjames
[00:39:12.040] [SPEAKER_05]: I think would make my top five
[00:39:14.080] [SPEAKER_05]: The should I cut that or
[00:39:16.180] [SPEAKER_05]: Why
[00:39:18.120] [SPEAKER_05]: That was a real opinion of
[00:39:20.860] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh Jimmy Garapolo
[00:39:22.580] [SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, yes
[00:39:26.520] [SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry he's not good. He's not relevant
[00:39:30.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Actually so in one of my leagues one of the managers she is
[00:39:34.660] [SPEAKER_01]: Obsessed with Jimmy Garapolo and she actually drafted him and just stashed him out of sheer respect
[00:39:40.860] [SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's impressive. I was like dude you're beating everyone with like one roster spot
[00:39:46.340] [SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's good looking while he kind of looks like um like actor
[00:39:50.480] [SPEAKER_05]: Dude yeah, he's like bad at acting though
[00:39:54.760] [SPEAKER_04]: God is fair. I mean I guess out of football players like the people who I wanted to draft were
[00:40:00.520] [SPEAKER_04]: Like a man raw same brown and sick one
[00:40:04.120] [SPEAKER_04]: What's his life?
[00:40:05.020] [SPEAKER_04]: Barley they're tiny dudes. Oh, but they got great smiles
[00:40:08.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Jalen hurts as well, right?
[00:40:10.740] [SPEAKER_04]: Jalen hurts was like he's consistently on the like top five hottest NFL players
[00:40:16.220] [SPEAKER_02]: But I think he's like okay. He's a pretty slender body
[00:40:19.040] [SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we have to mention Nick Boca. He's pretty up there. Loki CMC is also kind of good looking
[00:40:26.880] [SPEAKER_02]: Uh
[00:40:27.380] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh really I think it's like a model. He's very square. I think CMC is a bit like rectangular
[00:40:34.740] [SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, he's like not bad looking. He's kind of like handsome Squidward
[00:40:39.680] [SPEAKER_01]: Like it's yeah, yeah, if he had spun broad body
[00:40:43.820] Hahaha
[00:40:45.940] [SPEAKER_01]: I watched like a lot of tennis growing up so like I see a lot of the European tennis players
[00:40:50.000] [SPEAKER_01]: So there was one check guy Tomas Bariditch. He was like this like six five like hunk
[00:40:55.100] [SPEAKER_01]: Very good at tennis too, and then he ended up marrying like a super model but he was you know very attractive as well
[00:41:00.180] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, so he have tennis players Mateo Baritini dude. He's so good looking you'll pull up a photo
[00:41:07.700] [SPEAKER_04]: I will I will I don't know any tennis player do this guy like should not be playing tennis
[00:41:12.780] [SPEAKER_01]: He he signed an endorsement with like Hugo Boss and so when Crystal and I we went to New York for the US open
[00:41:17.960] [SPEAKER_01]: We swam by the boss door and she was like taking photos of the store. She's like oh Mateo gonna be here
[00:41:25.100] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, my dream is to bump into him in New York during the US open
[00:41:29.920] [SPEAKER_02]: You should probably go there in her first week then that that just means he's not playing like
[00:41:34.320] [SPEAKER_02]: Did he get KO
[00:41:36.140] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he lost like second round this year. Yeah, okay. He used to be good
[00:41:39.900] [SPEAKER_01]: But he's just like a lot of injuries lately, you know, but to be fair he lost to like this years finalist
[00:41:46.340] [SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like he lost to a nobody
[00:41:49.300] [SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think that brings up a question I wanted to ask you guys which is injuries
[00:41:53.260] [SPEAKER_05]: And if I get to very natural part of sports cuz sports obviously so physical
[00:41:57.380] [SPEAKER_05]: But when someone gets injured do you guys think oh so unlucky like it's too bad that guy got injured or do you think
[00:42:05.040] [SPEAKER_05]: Avoiding injuries is also a part of your job as an athlete. I think it's like a mixture of both
[00:42:11.360] [SPEAKER_01]: A professional athlete, right? Is responsible for taking care of his or her
[00:42:15.980] [SPEAKER_01]: Body for the duration of the career but
[00:42:18.200] [SPEAKER_01]: One example that comes to mind is Derek Rose on the Chicago Bulls
[00:42:22.940] [SPEAKER_01]: He famously tore his ACL quite early on his career like sort of at or approaching his peak
[00:42:28.740] [SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't necessarily his fault because his coach did not pull him
[00:42:32.800] [SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't supposed to be playing they were sort of up
[00:42:36.120] [SPEAKER_01]: Quite big on this game the starters are usually taken out of the game to preserve them and he was still playing
[00:42:42.660] [SPEAKER_01]: Right, and so this was you know
[00:42:44.560] [SPEAKER_01]: This sort of actually changed his career significantly because he was never to stay in player afterwards and so
[00:42:49.660] [SPEAKER_01]: He's often considered like one of these great what ifs in basketball and so that's sort of a thing
[00:42:54.320] [SPEAKER_01]: Right, it's like oh he did everything he could but he was ultimately thrust in a situation where
[00:42:59.240] [SPEAKER_01]: It was unavoidable for him and then he tore his other ACL
[00:43:03.640] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, thanks. I feel like injuries usually are pretty unavoidable like you don't really blame anybody for it usually
[00:43:11.180] [SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's like someone who's super open about like not taking care of their body because I know
[00:43:17.760] [SPEAKER_02]: In the NFL there are players who eat extremely like poorly for further diet like McDonald's every meal or like only candy
[00:43:25.340] [SPEAKER_02]: A lot of players do that and then like kind of brag about it
[00:43:27.620] [SPEAKER_02]: But then when they get hurt people are like okay, well, I mean, I'm not surprised
[00:43:31.820] [SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I think sometimes it's just like freak injuries
[00:43:35.060] [SPEAKER_04]: Especially like non-contact injuries
[00:43:37.600] [SPEAKER_04]: You know like tearing your Achilles that kind of stuff. It's just like really sad when it happens
[00:43:43.160] [SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple football players I've seen where they like
[00:43:46.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Injured themselves jet skiing you know in the offseason
[00:43:49.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Things right I think it's I think of course like there's there's levels to it where maybe in their contract
[00:43:55.080] [SPEAKER_01]: They're not supposed to be doing certain things. I think like NBA players some of them should have closet saying like you shouldn't be playing
[00:44:01.500] [SPEAKER_01]: You know like pick-up games during the season like I guess on that that point
[00:44:04.960] [SPEAKER_01]: It is sort of like the athletes responsible
[00:44:06.460] [SPEAKER_01]: Like don't put yourself in situations where you can potentially get injured
[00:44:11.760] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, there's this like really sad story about this one basketball player John Wall
[00:44:17.300] [SPEAKER_04]: I think it was he tore his
[00:44:20.280] [SPEAKER_04]: ACL and then he was like rehabbing at home and then he slipped in the bathtub and tore his Achilles. Oh my god
[00:44:27.120] [SPEAKER_04]: And everyone was like dude that is just like so unlucky
[00:44:33.220] [SPEAKER_01]: Freak accidents and then there was a setback actually where I got infected too
[00:44:37.320] [SPEAKER_01]: So it was like it took much longer than expected and then he was no longer in the league
[00:44:43.000] [SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of like an interesting aspect of sports though because
[00:44:47.300] [SPEAKER_05]: It might not be someone's full responsibility to avoid injury but I feel like it's almost like a third like a hidden statistic
[00:44:54.140] [SPEAKER_05]: Lebron James. I feel like it's often
[00:44:56.460] [SPEAKER_05]: touted for being one of the greatest athletes of all time
[00:44:59.660] [SPEAKER_05]: Partly because he was able to stay injury free for so long which in itself is like a huge feat
[00:45:05.040] [SPEAKER_05]: And then you hear about rookies like Wembenaia who is like
[00:45:08.960] [SPEAKER_05]: Someone new in the NBA and I feel like people are always like oh yeah, he's so good at
[00:45:13.400] [SPEAKER_05]: Defense but then the caveat is that he has like a huge potential to get injured or something
[00:45:19.160] [SPEAKER_04]: Right, I feel like it's almost like a statistic honestly. I really is you try to not draft like injury prone people in
[00:45:26.800] [SPEAKER_01]: Fannaces I think they look the same right like availability is an ability to and that is true both for like
[00:45:33.400] [SPEAKER_01]: Fantasy n for real life so Ben Simmons for instance
[00:45:37.680] [SPEAKER_01]: Guys play the hundred games in four seasons
[00:45:39.800] [SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's good for them I guess is they still get paid usually if they don't play so like
[00:45:45.880] [SPEAKER_02]: I know John wall he took like two years to come back but during that period
[00:45:48.740] [SPEAKER_02]: I think he made like 50 or 60 million yeah from this 40 a year. I'm just rehaving to so you know that's crazy
[00:45:57.160] [SPEAKER_01]: But I think like that's for you know
[00:45:59.540] [SPEAKER_01]: The guarantee like NBA contracts are unique because they're guaranteed if you're like into NFL
[00:46:04.240] [SPEAKER_01]: It's less guaranteed or if you're playing like individual sports like tennis for instance
[00:46:09.580] [SPEAKER_01]: Baritini was out with multiple surgeries and now he's has like a much stronger
[00:46:14.360] [SPEAKER_01]: Across those are sobbing over here
[00:46:16.840] [SPEAKER_01]: For like these individual sports
[00:46:19.300] [SPEAKER_01]: The injuries set back so much larger because then it makes the climb back to like relevance or
[00:46:25.080] [SPEAKER_01]: Back to a place where you know you can compete again much harder because you don't have like that team aspect to support you too
[00:46:31.260] [SPEAKER_04]: True and I think in like tennis the main way you make money is by winning you get money per like
[00:46:37.280] [SPEAKER_04]: tournament that you compete in
[00:46:39.580] [SPEAKER_01]: They're almost like contractors. So there's there's no a recently that the men's league has implemented like a salary floor now
[00:46:45.840] [SPEAKER_01]: But it's still not enough to cover like all the travel they do
[00:46:50.060] [SPEAKER_02]: I feel like what's interesting about sports is there's almost two different dynamics sometimes with players
[00:46:55.320] [SPEAKER_02]: So there's like the star player and then the fringe player who's like barely making the team
[00:46:59.540] [SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting to think about how different their worlds are to like the star player probably has never thought about
[00:47:05.060] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I might get cut from this team or whatever like the fringe player is always thinking like
[00:47:09.580] [SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how can I just like stay on the team?
[00:47:11.780] [SPEAKER_02]: Right, like the star players like oh, I'm waiting for my next 10 million dollars
[00:47:15.220] [SPEAKER_02]: My next contract or whatever
[00:47:17.400] [SPEAKER_04]: Do that's so true. I remember there was this one guy on the warriors who was like a fringe player and he was making
[00:47:24.640] [SPEAKER_04]: I don't know it was like a couple hundred k for the year and
[00:47:29.240] [SPEAKER_04]: He was like dude. I can like barely afford housing in the bay because it's so expensive here
[00:47:33.580] [SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile like Steph Curry dream on green. They're like rolling in cash
[00:47:37.140] [SPEAKER_01]: There was like a joke about that player because they signed these sort of like not really like full NBA contracts and they're like do this guy qualifies for like
[00:47:44.960] [SPEAKER_01]: Affordable housing and
[00:47:47.300] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think like the starting quarterback for the Niners
[00:47:50.880] [SPEAKER_02]: They came out and said he has like four roommates. Oh my god
[00:47:54.960] [SPEAKER_02]: Out in the booties in San Jose because he just can't afford anything
[00:47:58.700] [SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he could be one of our friends neighbors
[00:48:00.900] [SPEAKER_01]: Just look for a Toyota
[00:48:04.020] [SPEAKER_01]: Was that's even like speaking of the 49ers Christian McAfrey like he's out right now and his replacement
[00:48:10.240] [SPEAKER_01]: Jordan Mason. I think his annual his whole annual salary is like just under a million and that's how much CMC makes per game
[00:48:18.180] [SPEAKER_01]: So that's like yeah talk about like this discrepancy
[00:48:23.120] [SPEAKER_04]: So to end off this episode we will do our own little draft of
[00:48:28.640] [SPEAKER_04]: our personal top three best athletes of all time
[00:48:33.360] [SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a snake draft which means that
[00:48:36.360] [SPEAKER_04]: Gisoo will be first pick and then James will be second. I'll be third
[00:48:40.380] [SPEAKER_04]: Jim and we'll be fourth and then we'll go back around so then Jim and we'll be fifth. I'll be six
[00:48:46.560] [SPEAKER_04]: etc. So we'll just do three rounds
[00:48:48.600] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I guess I'm first pick. I feel like this is an easy one. I'm gonna pick lip-ronging. I knew it
[00:48:55.970] [SPEAKER_02]: I'm just putting on my criteria. It's like not only could they do well in other sports
[00:49:01.250] [SPEAKER_02]: But also how much better are they than their peers in their own sports? So I'm going to use sandbolt
[00:49:06.650] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what is it? Great one
[00:49:08.850] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna choose Michael Jordan. I'm gonna go with no-back joke of it. Okay, go again
[00:49:15.590] [SPEAKER_01]: And then if I were to
[00:49:17.250] [SPEAKER_01]: Consider like James is quite serious. I'll go with another tennis player
[00:49:20.570] [SPEAKER_01]: Gail Momshees
[00:49:23.930] [SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's great athlete
[00:49:25.970] [SPEAKER_01]: For the record just just to preface out there. This is a six four freak of nature
[00:49:30.790] [SPEAKER_01]: Who said if he wasn't playing professional tennis he'd be in the NBA? Oh, I thought you were gonna say who looks good sure
[00:49:37.910] [SPEAKER_01]: Also very true
[00:49:41.110] [SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have a good one that I think might get overlooked a little bit Wayne Gretzky
[00:49:47.230] [SPEAKER_01]: That's a hot-nadian man. I saw hockey
[00:49:49.410] [SPEAKER_04]: He was so good that in fantasy hockey he had to be split into two players
[00:49:54.430] [SPEAKER_01]: It's actually I insane every time I read the Wayne Gretzky like stats it was like him and then like huge
[00:50:00.170] [SPEAKER_01]: Cazom and the number two
[00:50:01.750] [SPEAKER_02]: Someone said like if you take out all his goals and count as assist as half points
[00:50:06.450] [SPEAKER_02]: He'd still be the number one score. It's crazy
[00:50:11.030] [SPEAKER_05]: You were gonna pick him
[00:50:14.570] [SPEAKER_02]: Sharky now. Oh
[00:50:16.930] [SPEAKER_02]: Three of my lungs oh
[00:50:19.410] [SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm gonna pick Anthony Davis because of the vibes
[00:50:23.050] [SPEAKER_05]: He has good vibes and then I'm gonna pick
[00:50:26.790] [SPEAKER_05]: All-pick Nick Bosa
[00:50:29.270] [SPEAKER_05]: This is greatest of all the time. She's so yeah, my greatest of all times this is her mouth rush more
[00:50:35.550] [SPEAKER_05]: This is not objective
[00:50:38.710] [SPEAKER_02]: This is wild
[00:50:40.230] [SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you think to be a player
[00:50:43.530] [SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyways
[00:50:45.310] [SPEAKER_05]: Yes
[00:50:46.650] [SPEAKER_02]: Last pick I mean I get it's got to be the guy who's grunt I know
[00:50:50.770] [SPEAKER_02]: No, no
[00:50:52.810] [SPEAKER_04]: Dang yeah, this is hard now. Oh
[00:50:55.610] [SPEAKER_04]: Michael helps
[00:50:58.390] [SPEAKER_01]: I would probably put tiger woods up there. Oh, yeah, I'll take tiger woods to be my third
[00:51:04.370] [SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to say if this was a fantasy
[00:51:07.110] [SPEAKER_04]: Then G-su would have lost
[00:51:09.090] [SPEAKER_02]: Not good. Yeah, I think driven and Jesus thing was pretty close
[00:51:12.610] [SPEAKER_02]: G-somon B
[00:51:14.310] [SPEAKER_02]: Uh
[00:51:16.490] [SPEAKER_02]: Who is your first pick no batch? You okay, okay, that's that lines up with LeBron I think I just think it's hard for me to drop people
[00:51:23.950] [SPEAKER_05]: That I like don't give a shit about okay. I don't really care about Michael falls
[00:51:27.410] [SPEAKER_05]: But I know that guy's a gray athlete. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, that was fun
[00:51:31.950] [SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad we got to sit down and delve into our our new hobby scores
[00:51:38.950] [SPEAKER_04]: Yay, I love it. I'm so I'm fine
