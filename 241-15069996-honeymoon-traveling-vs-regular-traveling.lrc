[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal.
[00:00:03.200] And I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:04.800] So today our episode topic is actually about something that is pretty top of mind for me right now,
[00:00:21.700] which is the honeymoon.
[00:00:23.900] James, my husband and I just got back from our honeymoon about a week or so ago.
[00:00:28.700] We spent our honeymoon in Europe for about two weeks.
[00:00:32.500] So being back, I feel like I have a lot of fresh and funny stories about the honeymoon to share.
[00:00:37.700] We also thought it would be cool to kind of talk about the differences between planning for a honeymoon versus just planning for a regular vacation.
[00:00:44.700] Immediately, my first question for you is when you were planning the trip,
[00:00:50.100] did you specifically try to make it more honeymoon themed or was it kind of just like planning for any old trip?
[00:00:57.900] Dude, it's funny that you ask that because I think in my mind, there's like a very specific idea of what a honeymoon looks like.
[00:01:05.700] And oftentimes in movies and whatnot, I feel like honeymoons are almost centered around going to a really nice resort
[00:01:13.500] or maybe somewhere beachy, somewhere where you can get massages and spa and relax and tan.
[00:01:19.500] And then you come back just feeling really happy and relaxed.
[00:01:22.900] But for James and I, we actually took about four to five months after the wedding to actually go on our honeymoon.
[00:01:30.900] There was a shorter family trip that we had planned right after the wedding.
[00:01:34.900] And then also we just wanted to have some real months to like sit down and plan our honeymoon.
[00:01:41.100] So I didn't necessarily feel like I needed that rest and relaxation.
[00:01:45.300] I kind of wanted to use the honeymoon as an opportunity to visit places that I've always kind of envisioned for myself on our honeymoon.
[00:01:54.100] Oh, I see. No James envisioning?
[00:01:56.900] Okay, that makes it sound like I was dictatoring the honeymoon, but I swear there was some collaboration.
[00:02:03.900] Basically, I've always wanted to go to Switzerland for my honeymoon ever since I went for like a day or two in college.
[00:02:11.500] So I was like, oh my god, we have to go to Switzerland, blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:14.900] And I've always brought that up to James, even when we were like wedding planning actually.
[00:02:19.700] But because we're going to Europe, because we wanted to experience like a variety of different environments,
[00:02:24.900] so not just nature, but also somewhere with a lot of different cultures or somewhere with a lot of good food and shopping, etc.
[00:02:32.100] James wanted to go to London and Paris as well.
[00:02:34.500] So we did collaborate on the destination.
[00:02:38.700] Just making sure.
[00:02:41.500] But I feel like Switzerland is a good one.
[00:02:44.500] I always see such beautiful photos of the scenery there.
[00:02:48.100] Yeah.
[00:02:48.900] And like, you know, the K-drama Crash Landing on You at the end when they're in Switzerland.
[00:02:54.700] I was like, damn!
[00:02:57.100] Dude, so I've never watched that drama.
[00:02:59.300] Oh my god.
[00:03:00.300] Literally, I'm not even lying, probably 70 to 80% of the people that I talk to about the honeymoon
[00:03:06.300] and I tell them like, oh, I'm going to Switzerland.
[00:03:08.700] They're like, oh, for Crash Landing on You.
[00:03:10.900] And I'm like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:03:13.500] Like, I'm not envisioning the same thing in my mind that you're envisioning.
[00:03:16.700] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:03:18.900] But I feel like overall Switzerland is just a really pretty place.
[00:03:23.100] I don't know.
[00:03:23.700] Is it romantic?
[00:03:24.700] Maybe it's romantic because of the views.
[00:03:27.100] I feel like it is like a very popular couples travel destination.
[00:03:32.700] But I do want to point out that I think what you did,
[00:03:37.100] which is like take your honeymoon a while later after your wedding,
[00:03:41.700] has been a popular thing lately with people around our age.
[00:03:45.500] I've noticed that people have been mentioning how like taking the honeymoon right after the wedding
[00:03:51.700] is extremely stressful because that means you're planning your wedding and your honeymoon like at the same time.
[00:04:00.700] Right.
[00:04:01.400] And so it like becomes extra work during an already stressful time
[00:04:06.100] and a lot of people like to do like a honeymoon fund now in their registry.
[00:04:11.100] So I guess people like to collect their funds first before actually starting to plan
[00:04:16.500] and you know, like purchase the tickets and stuff like that.
[00:04:19.600] Right.
[00:04:20.400] So I feel like that's been a trend that I've been noticing.
[00:04:23.600] Yeah, it's so funny too because I see different arrangements on TikTok all the time.
[00:04:29.100] I actually saw a TikTok recently where someone said that she primarily planned the entire wedding
[00:04:34.400] and then the husband primarily planned the entire honeymoon.
[00:04:37.200] So at least there's some sort of division of work,
[00:04:39.300] but I was also like, is that a fair division of labor?
[00:04:44.400] That's true.
[00:04:45.400] The wedding is for what like tens to hundreds of people
[00:04:49.500] and then the honeymoon is just like two people.
[00:04:52.500] Exactly.
[00:04:53.800] And then I think for us too because we got married in December,
[00:04:57.000] there's not like a ton of different places that are convenient to travel to around that time
[00:05:02.200] with high costs for holidays and just like weather being pretty cold in a lot of different areas.
[00:05:08.200] So I was really happy we took the break
[00:05:10.300] and then plus I heard a lot of stories where people go on the honeymoon right after the wedding
[00:05:15.400] and then they spend like the first two days just like sleeping like 18 hours
[00:05:20.100] because they're so tired,
[00:05:21.700] but we were at least kind of like ready to explore
[00:05:24.900] and like feeling rejuvenated.
[00:05:26.700] So I thought that was good.
[00:05:28.100] Oh, yeah, that's smart.
[00:05:29.900] I think I've heard so many stories about how you know,
[00:05:33.600] how you're technically supposed to like consummate the marriage after the wedding night,
[00:05:42.400] but everyone's like, okay realistically,
[00:05:44.400] I just sleep because we're so fucking exhausted after the wedding.
[00:05:48.600] Oh my God.
[00:05:49.200] I'm just gonna no comment on that one.
[00:05:51.200] That's crazy.
[00:05:54.400] Wait, you haven't seen like those reddit threads?
[00:05:57.900] I have but it's just so funny to say like consummate.
[00:06:00.900] I don't know.
[00:06:03.100] I'm trying to keep it PG.
[00:06:06.800] But yeah, like imagine hopping on a plane the day after your wedding.
[00:06:10.400] Oh God. Imagine packing.
[00:06:13.200] Oh my God.
[00:06:13.900] For your honeymoon.
[00:06:14.900] You're so right.
[00:06:16.900] It's like okay, we have five hours between the end of this wedding and our flight.
[00:06:22.100] Exactly.
[00:06:23.600] But I thought when you asked in your original question about like wanting to have the honeymoon be romantic is actually quite funny
[00:06:32.200] because one like I said,
[00:06:34.400] I felt like our honeymoon being in multiple different like metropolitan cities didn't feel as classic resorty vacationing honeymoon.
[00:06:43.400] But two although when we were planning I wasn't necessarily thinking like oh we have to do these things that are romantic.
[00:06:50.300] I felt like when we were there I kind of had this internal pressure of like,
[00:06:54.500] oh my God, it's our honeymoon.
[00:06:55.800] This needs to be special.
[00:06:57.800] This is gonna sound hella entitled and it probably is a little bit
[00:07:01.500] but I felt this like immense pressure to bring it up to like hotel people to be like,
[00:07:08.000] oh, yeah, like we're on our honeymoon hoping that they would give us like free shit.
[00:07:12.600] Maybe not so much as an upgrade but maybe like a brownie or something.
[00:07:17.900] Or like a bottle of champagne in your room.
[00:07:20.000] Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:21.300] Did it work?
[00:07:22.400] Did you get any free stuff?
[00:07:24.800] So we stayed in four different hotels over like two weeks or so.
[00:07:28.900] Me and James were brave enough to mention it to three of the hotels.
[00:07:32.000] Hey, that's pretty good.
[00:07:33.200] Yeah, that's not bad three or four is pretty good.
[00:07:35.100] It took a lot of courage actually.
[00:07:36.300] That's a passing grade.
[00:07:39.300] But the first place they really did give us like a chocolate lava cake
[00:07:42.500] and then it said happy honeymoon or something and I was like this is really cute.
[00:07:46.400] The second place we got nervous and couldn't say it.
[00:07:50.000] The third place they gave us like a little tin of chocolates
[00:07:55.000] and then like a thing of macarons or something which is super cute.
[00:07:58.500] And then the last place gave us a bottle of champagne and like nuts
[00:08:02.900] and I was like, oh my god, it's like a gradually getting like nicer and nicer essentially.
[00:08:07.800] I like that.
[00:08:09.000] Have you ever stayed at these hotels before?
[00:08:11.300] No, I haven't.
[00:08:12.600] Okay, because I'm like what if they already do that?
[00:08:17.400] Like they're like, oh they're on their honeymoon just throw in like a honeymoon card or something.
[00:08:22.600] Dude probably.
[00:08:24.000] We also went to like a more upscale restaurant one of the nights
[00:08:27.400] and then they were like, oh what's the occasion blah blah blah
[00:08:30.400] and we were like, oh we're on our honeymoon.
[00:08:32.300] So, you know, we're just here to celebrate.
[00:08:34.700] You can kind of hear like what people around you are talking about with their waiters
[00:08:38.700] and also what they're getting right?
[00:08:40.400] So I heard the tables next to us get a happy birthday like little free dessert or something
[00:08:45.800] and I was like, oh my god, that's so cute.
[00:08:47.100] And like internally I was low-key wondering if they were going to do one for us.
[00:08:50.700] Yeah, but they didn't.
[00:08:52.600] Instead they gave us a signed card with a little note for us
[00:08:57.600] and then it was like, oh like thank you from the chef
[00:08:59.500] and the team for visiting on the honeymoon blah blah blah, which is very sweet.
[00:09:03.400] But I was also just like damn I wonder what qualifies for free dessert
[00:09:07.000] and like what doesn't at these restaurants?
[00:09:09.100] Maybe you have to tell them in advance.
[00:09:11.500] Oh that yeah, that could be true.
[00:09:13.400] I'm wondering because at least in the US nowadays a lot of the reservation systems,
[00:09:19.600] they'll ask you like, oh are you celebrating anything?
[00:09:22.600] I wonder if maybe that's part of it.
[00:09:24.600] They're like, okay we can prep this shit for them.
[00:09:27.700] That's true because we did spring it on them kind of early on in the dinner.
[00:09:32.300] Hmm. I guess they did give you something like a signed card but not dessert.
[00:09:39.300] It was just like that mindset I was in, you know,
[00:09:41.600] I think it was less so that partly I did want to get some free cool stuff.
[00:09:47.000] You only go on one honeymoon in your lifetime.
[00:09:50.300] Well...
[00:09:51.800] Well, um...
[00:09:55.900] Maybe that's not a guarantee.
[00:09:57.900] That's not a guarantee.
[00:10:00.100] You go on n number of honeymoons.
[00:10:05.360] Ideally one honeymoon per life.
[00:10:08.960] But I think another part of me was just on like reddit and stuff.
[00:10:14.260] I feel like people are always like, oh you should take advantage of being on your honeymoon
[00:10:18.360] and get all this free stuff.
[00:10:20.160] So then I didn't want to be the idiot that doesn't mention it
[00:10:23.560] and then like doesn't get stuff, you know?
[00:10:25.360] So I think it was kind of like a double-edged sword.
[00:10:27.460] It was cool getting free stuff here and there
[00:10:30.060] but also I feel like the pressure of it was like a little much for me
[00:10:33.060] because I don't love to like ask for these things normally.
[00:10:36.260] Like I hold a lot of shame for no reason about these things.
[00:10:40.160] Yeah, I think I get what you mean.
[00:10:41.860] It's like almost like embarrassment sometimes
[00:10:44.360] when like they come out with, you know, this thing with a candle in it.
[00:10:48.360] You're like, oh god now everyone's gonna look at me.
[00:10:50.460] Please stop.
[00:10:53.360] I think like it's not as bad when they ask you,
[00:10:57.560] you know, what brings you into the city or whatever
[00:10:59.760] but sometimes the conversation doesn't go there, right?
[00:11:02.460] Like you guys are talking about something else.
[00:11:04.060] So then I feel like what really made me feel a little bit embarrassed
[00:11:07.760] was like at the check-in counter when I was like rolling through my head of like,
[00:11:11.760] okay, how do I bring up that I'm on my honeymoon
[00:11:14.360] without being like, I'm on my honeymoon.
[00:11:16.260] Like give me something free.
[00:11:20.660] Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of societal expectation.
[00:11:25.460] Like we always hear stories about people being like,
[00:11:28.260] yeah, if you just mention that you're on your honeymoon
[00:11:30.960] places will usually give you some sort of free thing
[00:11:33.660] or like, you know, some sort of nice gift.
[00:11:36.360] And so that like expectation builds in your mind.
[00:11:39.260] You're like, okay now I just have to figure, you know,
[00:11:42.260] like I'll get something now.
[00:11:43.760] I just have to figure out how to mention it.
[00:11:46.760] And then if you don't get, you know,
[00:11:48.360] maybe a gift as like nice as what people online are saying they've gotten.
[00:11:53.460] It's like oh shoot.
[00:11:54.860] I guess it didn't meet expectations.
[00:11:56.560] But in the reality the expectations are like just completely arbitrary.
[00:12:01.260] Yeah, I'm like, well, I guess I didn't get any sort of upgrades,
[00:12:05.160] but it's cool to kind of get some stuff here and there.
[00:12:08.960] But the cool thing about, you know, being on our honeymoon
[00:12:11.560] kind of organically coming up in casual conversations with strangers was
[00:12:15.960] it low-key just felt very good to be like,
[00:12:17.860] oh my God, like we're on our honeymoon
[00:12:19.960] and they're always like, oh my gosh, congrats.
[00:12:21.760] So cool blah blah blah.
[00:12:23.060] And I feel like it always led for like a very natural conversation
[00:12:26.560] regardless of whether or not they're going to give us free stuff.
[00:12:30.160] I'd say over half the time when we were just conversing with like a waiter
[00:12:33.760] or you know, just like people that we were interacting with.
[00:12:37.060] We didn't have like an ulterior motive to bring it up
[00:12:40.760] and people are just very happy for you
[00:12:42.160] even though we're just like complete strangers.
[00:12:44.160] So I think that energy felt really nice.
[00:12:46.260] True.
[00:12:47.160] I guess we must release ourselves of the ulterior motives.
[00:12:51.360] It's the greed that ruins everything.
[00:12:54.460] Okay, but I do have a tip for you for next time.
[00:12:58.460] Maybe you can just, you know how now if you book stuff online,
[00:13:02.460] you can sometimes message the hotel beforehand
[00:13:05.860] whether it's like through Expedia or like some sort of direct email.
[00:13:09.860] Maybe in that you can like say,
[00:13:11.960] hey, we're celebrating something like a birthday or whatever
[00:13:16.260] and then maybe that reduces your need for in-person interaction.
[00:13:22.160] True.
[00:13:22.960] Next time you can hit 404.
[00:13:24.960] So we actually did do that.
[00:13:26.860] Oh, you did?
[00:13:27.360] For hotel bookings because you can usually put in like a little note like you said.
[00:13:31.260] So then we put like, oh so excited to come.
[00:13:33.360] We'll be on our honeymoon whatever
[00:13:35.460] or like sometimes we just put like honeymoon or something.
[00:13:38.660] Honeymoon period.
[00:13:41.560] But I think it depends on the hotel.
[00:13:43.360] So one of the hotels, we actually forgot to bring it up
[00:13:46.160] and then I was almost thinking like should we go like call them or something?
[00:13:49.860] Yeah.
[00:13:50.760] Again, it's the greed but because they saw the note
[00:13:54.060] they had already prepared something in their room.
[00:13:56.060] So then we didn't have to do anything but a different hotel like we had put it in the note,
[00:14:00.660] but they didn't do something and that one we were staying multiple days.
[00:14:04.460] So I don't know.
[00:14:05.460] I was kind of like are they going to do something on the last day or something?
[00:14:08.660] Probably because we didn't bring it up during checking like they didn't do anything.
[00:14:12.560] I see.
[00:14:13.060] Yeah, I think it's a good tip for shy people like me just put it in the note
[00:14:16.960] and then try to bring it up during check-in.
[00:14:20.660] You did your best.
[00:14:21.660] You tried.
[00:14:24.360] The rest is up to the hotel if they're feeling it or not.
[00:14:28.360] Yeah, it's like mildly embarrassing talking about this actually.
[00:14:31.960] It was a huge source of stress for me on our trip.
[00:14:35.760] No, I totally get that though because I've seen a lot of I don't know like forums,
[00:14:40.660] Reddit threads things like that where people are like one of the most common examples is like flights.
[00:14:45.960] They're like you should just walk up to the flight attendant doing the check-ins
[00:14:50.560] and just ask is there a seat upgrade available
[00:14:53.660] and you know, they'll usually give it to you and I'm like,
[00:14:55.860] is it really that easy?
[00:14:58.160] Are you sure?
[00:15:01.060] I know I for sure did not have the cojones to do that.
[00:15:04.360] Although a flight attendant randomly asked me
[00:15:07.060] and James why we were traveling which I feel like never happens.
[00:15:10.760] Yeah, and we're like, oh my God, we're on our honeymoon.
[00:15:13.360] And then after that every time she came around for a drink.
[00:15:15.460] She would be like all my lovebirds like my honeymooners
[00:15:18.960] and she was just like the nicest person ever.
[00:15:20.860] So that's cute.
[00:15:22.460] Yeah, so our trip started off on like a very positive note with her being super nice.
[00:15:28.660] I will say one time speaking of you know,
[00:15:31.360] bringing stuff up and asking for things at like hotels
[00:15:34.660] and all that one time I was staying at a hotel
[00:15:38.760] and my room was right across from the elevator
[00:15:42.160] and I was like shoot it's kind of loud like I can literally hear
[00:15:45.060] when people are coming up and like leaving especially
[00:15:48.160] because I think it was like a weekend or maybe it was a Friday night.
[00:15:51.260] So people were being loud and active
[00:15:54.460] and little rowdy, you know, so I was like,
[00:15:59.760] I think I literally was in my room like mustering up courage for like 40 minutes.
[00:16:06.160] Oh my God, and I was like, okay, I'm just going to go down there.
[00:16:08.860] I'm going to go to the check-in table
[00:16:10.660] and I'm just going to be like hey, do you have other rooms available
[00:16:14.160] because mine is across from the elevator.
[00:16:17.260] It's a little loud.
[00:16:20.160] After you know, 30 or 40 minutes of mustering up the courage.
[00:16:24.560] I finally go down and I ask and the guy was like,
[00:16:27.260] yeah, let me check and he was like, sorry, we don't have any rooms
[00:16:29.560] and I was like dude, I could have just stayed in my room
[00:16:32.360] and kept my mouth shut.
[00:16:36.560] Wait, that's so sad, unrewarded.
[00:16:39.260] The results would have been the same.
[00:16:42.160] So I totally understand the like stress
[00:16:44.960] and fear of like bringing something up
[00:16:48.060] when people are always like no, it's so easy.
[00:16:49.960] Just ask and like dude, is it that easy though?
[00:16:54.560] Yeah, and people are like, oh you should lie about being on your honeymoon.
[00:16:58.160] I'm like I'm on my honeymoon and I still can't bring it up.
[00:17:02.360] It's a tough world out there.
[00:17:04.460] Dude, it really is.
[00:17:06.360] Well besides announcing that you're on your honeymoon to various service workers.
[00:17:12.560] To people who did not ask.
[00:17:15.460] When you're like planning activities and stuff for your trip.
[00:17:19.060] Did you try to choose activities or like locations
[00:17:23.660] or like dining options that leaned more romantic I guess?
[00:17:28.560] Or was it less intentionally romantic, I guess?
[00:17:32.660] So I think there were a couple of things that we did during planning
[00:17:37.060] and also on the trip actually that helped the trip feel a lot more special
[00:17:41.860] and really more like a honeymoon.
[00:17:43.760] One thing being since this isn't just a normal vacation,
[00:17:47.260] we try not to conserve costs as much as we normally would.
[00:17:51.360] So for example staying at nicer hotels than we normally would book,
[00:17:55.560] booking maybe more nice dinners or going to nicer bars than we normally would
[00:18:00.860] and then also not being afraid to indulge in certain things.
[00:18:04.560] So like going to the spa and things like that.
[00:18:07.160] I thought it was interesting one like obviously staying at nicer hotels is like a dream.
[00:18:12.160] So that was great.
[00:18:13.260] Yeah, but two because it was a honeymoon.
[00:18:16.060] I felt like both of us were very conscious about not trying to like overexert ourselves
[00:18:21.560] and not trying to like force ourself to sightsee
[00:18:24.960] because I think sometimes traveling can really feel like
[00:18:27.260] oh we need to hit these landmarks and like do these things etc.
[00:18:31.260] But for us like there are definitely things that we wanted to hit on our itinerary,
[00:18:36.260] but if not wasn't a huge deal.
[00:18:38.360] One of the days we even stayed in the hotel room and watched our favorite TV show
[00:18:42.860] and got like room service and stuff,
[00:18:44.660] which I feel like on a normal vacation I wouldn't do something like that.
[00:18:48.160] So it just really felt nice
[00:18:50.160] and I think what I liked about it the most was it very much so felt like us finding our rhythm together
[00:18:57.360] and connecting with each other
[00:18:59.460] which is something that I feel like goes up and down during like normal vacations.
[00:19:04.460] That's true because I feel like normal vacations can have some moments of like stress
[00:19:10.460] when you're like, oh god, we need to make this like reservation
[00:19:13.760] or we need to run across the city to like get to this place to sightsee or whatever.
[00:19:18.760] So it sounds like you tried to keep things as low stress as possible.
[00:19:23.060] Yeah, although we did have a really high stress moment
[00:19:25.560] where we somehow in our planning booked the wrong train slash the wrong flight.
[00:19:31.260] So we had booked a train from Paris to London on our last day
[00:19:34.160] because our flight to the US was out of London,
[00:19:37.760] but the train that we booked somehow arrived at London
[00:19:41.760] literally when we were supposed to be boarding the plane.
[00:19:44.360] I guess I don't know how we just missed it completely in our planning process,
[00:19:48.960] but we didn't even realize until we were about to get off the train.
[00:19:52.360] We were like what the fuck like, I don't know how
[00:19:54.360] and I feel like if you know me and James,
[00:19:55.960] we're not really the type of people to like do stuff like that.
[00:19:58.360] Yeah, we just completely forgot slash it slipped our mind
[00:20:02.360] slash every time we checked we didn't even notice.
[00:20:04.160] Oh my God.
[00:20:05.060] Everything ended up being okay.
[00:20:06.460] We called the airport and they were able to rebook us with no fee
[00:20:10.560] to fly a couple hours later.
[00:20:12.060] Nice, but I was like whoa, maybe we were like too in tune with each other
[00:20:15.960] and like not in tune enough with the schedule.
[00:20:21.160] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:20:22.060] I'm just imagining every time you two check.
[00:20:25.460] Oh, yeah, what time is our train tomorrow again?
[00:20:26.960] You're like, oh it's this time like we should be getting off at this time
[00:20:30.360] and the flight leaves at this time.
[00:20:32.360] So we're good.
[00:20:33.960] No one bats an eye.
[00:20:35.760] No one's like wait, that's like five minutes apart.
[00:20:40.160] Dude, I know that's literally what happened
[00:20:42.460] and the crazy thing is that whole week that whole last week of the honeymoon.
[00:20:46.860] I kept checking the flight app to be like,
[00:20:49.160] oh maybe we can upgrade to business or like whatever.
[00:20:52.160] So I was constantly looking at the flight info
[00:20:54.860] and then even like night before the train ride to James
[00:20:58.360] and I were kind of talking about it
[00:20:59.660] and then I remember at one point on the train ride James was like,
[00:21:02.860] oh how come it says we're supposed to be boarding
[00:21:05.360] and then I was like, oh that's just because there's like a time difference
[00:21:07.560] between London and Paris.
[00:21:09.560] Then he was like, oh, okay like five minutes later.
[00:21:11.560] He was like, okay.
[00:21:12.260] No, we are absolutely supposed to be boarding right now.
[00:21:17.860] That's so funny.
[00:21:19.460] I was like, how did we not notice until like minute of boarding time?
[00:21:22.960] Oh my God.
[00:21:24.260] Okay, but that's a good point.
[00:21:25.960] There is a time difference between France and England.
[00:21:29.660] So maybe that was throwing you off.
[00:21:31.960] Like maybe you thought you had an hour.
[00:21:33.260] True.
[00:21:34.160] I don't know.
[00:21:34.560] I don't even know what happened.
[00:21:35.460] I don't know who that was.
[00:21:36.560] That wasn't me.
[00:21:37.360] I don't claim her.
[00:21:39.360] Wait, that's so true because you and James are the type to get to the airport
[00:21:42.860] a little earlier usually.
[00:21:43.960] Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:46.460] Oh my God.
[00:21:47.760] Earlier you were describing how in your mind
[00:21:51.060] you have kind of like a vision of what a honeymoon is
[00:21:55.460] and you kind of described it like, you know, being at a resort having
[00:21:58.660] like a relaxing time being by the beach that kind of stuff.
[00:22:01.960] And when you're saying that I was like, oh shit.
[00:22:04.560] I actually have no idea what a honeymoon is supposed to be like.
[00:22:10.160] Maybe that's better actually because then you can actually morph
[00:22:13.160] the honeymoon into what you want it to be when it comes.
[00:22:16.560] Dude, but then I have like no starting point in my mind.
[00:22:20.960] I was like, oh shoot actually like how is a honeymoon different from
[00:22:24.660] a trip?
[00:22:26.960] Like you do some more romantic things, I guess but then at the same
[00:22:30.160] time like if you're traveling with a significant other it kind of
[00:22:34.360] already is romantic in it, you know, like the baseline just because
[00:22:38.460] it's basically like a very long date.
[00:22:42.060] That's true.
[00:22:43.060] That's an interesting question actually and maybe like half the magic
[00:22:46.960] is because you just got married.
[00:22:48.660] So you're like in your newlywed era and the energy is just like special
[00:22:53.460] in that way.
[00:22:54.260] Yeah, but I guess the way I saw it was if on a regular vacation,
[00:22:58.560] it's like I really want to go to this destination with someone I
[00:23:02.360] love or my closest friends or my family.
[00:23:04.960] I feel like the honeymoon is more like oh, I am choosing this destination
[00:23:09.560] to be the background for my honeymoon sort of it's like your priority
[00:23:13.360] for that trip is your new husband or your new wife or your new partner.
[00:23:17.560] Yeah, and then the destination is kind of the side character.
[00:23:21.360] Oh, I think the way you put it makes a lot of sense actually because
[00:23:25.660] you're right normally traveling.
[00:23:27.860] It's like the main goal is exploration.
[00:23:31.360] Like I have I've never been here or I want to do something in this
[00:23:34.460] location but a honeymoon is more like the focus is who you're with
[00:23:40.360] rather than where you're going.
[00:23:42.360] Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:44.060] And I think with that mindset it totally changed the way that I see
[00:23:48.860] traveling honestly because I feel like you know being someone who
[00:23:53.060] went on a ton of like Korean guided group bus tours when I was young
[00:23:57.660] like I feel like there was a very specific idea of traveling in my
[00:24:00.460] head, which was if I go to Spain, I have to see everything in Spain
[00:24:04.760] that's famous and if not, then why am I even going kind of but this
[00:24:09.360] time I was like, yeah, what do I want to do?
[00:24:12.260] Like what do we want to enjoy and like do here and if that's you know,
[00:24:17.260] staying home one day that's fine.
[00:24:18.860] If that's going out to this restaurant, that's fine.
[00:24:21.160] But like what are we feeling and it just felt very like special and
[00:24:26.660] I think that special feeling kind of helped envelope a lot of the
[00:24:30.560] trip because you know when you go to Europe like people say some
[00:24:33.460] racist shit sometimes I think a lot of people when they travel they
[00:24:36.860] experience that regardless of where they go, but even stuff like
[00:24:40.460] that that we experienced.
[00:24:41.560] I feel like James and I were just like cracking up about it the whole
[00:24:43.860] trip and I was like dude, this is honeymoon buff right here.
[00:24:47.560] Nothing can hurt you on your honeymoon.
[00:24:53.560] But I think in that way my learning from the honeymoon was I feel
[00:24:57.760] like this sort of energy can be very carefully preserved and applied
[00:25:01.860] to a lot of different types of vacations and travels whether it's
[00:25:05.460] with your husband or wife or not and I was like, I just need to
[00:25:09.460] channel my like honeymoon self in other vacations and like, you know
[00:25:13.960] enjoy it more and feel more in tune with what I want.
[00:25:16.660] Mm-hmm.
[00:25:17.360] I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:25:19.160] We've kind of mentioned it before on the pod how like the way that
[00:25:23.160] we've traveled when we were younger and like you just mentioned too
[00:25:26.660] it's like we go to a place and we're like, oh my god, we're here.
[00:25:29.660] We need to hit everything and I guess now that travel is like so
[00:25:33.860] much more accessible in comparison to when we were younger.
[00:25:37.460] We're starting to learn and understand our own travel habits versus
[00:25:43.760] like our parents that we have, you know grown up on in the past.
[00:25:48.560] So I think that is definitely something I can relate to as well
[00:25:51.960] and we've also talked about this before how we are kind of similar
[00:25:55.860] where we're like, okay, let's not actually pack our schedules too
[00:25:58.860] much because we're realizing that if we pack our schedules too
[00:26:03.260] much we are just gonna like burn out by the end and hate everyone.
[00:26:10.260] Exactly and I feel like especially on a honeymoon that is
[00:26:13.660] not the goal.
[00:26:16.460] Yeah, I think our itinerary was fairly loose with maybe like a
[00:26:19.860] couple of things to do each day and it's really more like guidelines
[00:26:23.160] and whatnot.
[00:26:23.860] But what I did find very funny was you Crystal and your boyfriend
[00:26:28.360] went to like two of the three locations that James and I did I
[00:26:33.160] think literally like a month or maybe even less before we went
[00:26:36.760] on our honeymoon.
[00:26:38.060] So the cool part of that was when I was watching your guys's
[00:26:41.260] stories.
[00:26:41.760] I was like, this is like a preview of what we're going to do in
[00:26:44.060] like two weeks and then also for a split second before we knew
[00:26:49.160] like the exact dates we were traveling.
[00:26:51.460] I remember I was like, oh my god Crystal like me and James might
[00:26:53.960] be in Paris and London on our honeymoon.
[00:26:56.360] Like maybe we should meet up and I remember you were like you
[00:26:58.760] want to meet up with me on your honeymoon.
[00:27:02.260] I was like, is that allowed?
[00:27:05.160] Dude and also a close coworker of mine who lives across the
[00:27:09.160] US so I never get to see her in person.
[00:27:11.360] She was also in Paris and London the same times I was and I
[00:27:15.860] briefly considered I was like should I be like we should meet
[00:27:18.560] up and then I'll say no that's like low-key curse.
[00:27:23.720] Oh my god.
[00:27:24.620] Okay.
[00:27:24.920] I also feel like London and Paris are the destinations of the
[00:27:28.620] year.
[00:27:29.420] Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:27:31.020] I've already seen a bunch of friends go and when I was there
[00:27:34.720] at least two or three of my friends were also in like London
[00:27:38.520] and Paris at the same time that I was there.
[00:27:40.420] So I met up with like a few of them and I was like, oh my god
[00:27:42.920] is crazy.
[00:27:44.020] Yeah, and then I did think to like you and James.
[00:27:47.320] I was like wow if I were Jisoo and James right now, there's
[00:27:50.520] no way I would be meeting up with people.
[00:27:53.320] That's so funny.
[00:27:54.220] Yeah, actually when we were traveling to I remember seeing
[00:27:56.620] like at least one or two people just mutuals on Instagram who
[00:27:59.720] are also in London and Paris at similar times but that kind
[00:28:03.420] of reminds me of one thing that I consciously did on our
[00:28:06.720] honeymoon that I think is different from our regular traveling
[00:28:10.320] which is staying off social media and I think usually my
[00:28:14.920] urge when I travel is to post at least snippets here and there.
[00:28:18.720] I'm pretty inconsistent about it, but usually I'll post at
[00:28:21.520] least like a story or two about where I'm at what I'm eating
[00:28:25.920] etc.
[00:28:27.020] But this time I snapped a ton of photos but didn't post anything
[00:28:31.620] not even a single story actually and then I also checked
[00:28:37.020] Messenger and like text messages and stuff a lot less than
[00:28:40.720] I normally would and I think that contributed to a lot of
[00:28:44.520] the honeymoon feeling too where I was kind of like, okay, I'm
[00:28:47.120] taking PTO from life.
[00:28:50.620] Also, I think that's a good way to keep the focus on just you
[00:28:55.120] and James like, you know, this time is like just you two and
[00:28:59.120] you're not sharing it with the world or with your friends.
[00:29:02.020] It's just like truly your private time your like honeymoon.
[00:29:07.620] Yeah, I know it felt like weirdly very very special and I say
[00:29:11.520] weirdly because I don't know like there's nothing that special
[00:29:14.920] about not posting on Instagram yet.
[00:29:16.920] It's still like the impact was pretty big for me.
[00:29:20.020] I can totally understand that plus like imagine you're posting
[00:29:23.620] and then maybe your friends comment like oh my god, so cute
[00:29:26.620] like are you on your honeymoon and then you know, you have to
[00:29:29.420] go answer them and then it just like takes more time away from
[00:29:33.320] the time that you're spending together.
[00:29:35.220] Also, it's like this is your private memory like you don't
[00:29:38.520] have to share it with everyone not everyone needs to know what
[00:29:41.820] you did on your honeymoon.
[00:29:44.620] That makes it sound like I did some like secret shit.
[00:29:48.120] You know, I just mean like, you know,
[00:29:53.220] like it's your private memory.
[00:29:59.420] They don't need to follow you across Europe.
[00:30:02.320] That's true.
[00:30:03.520] And I don't think everyone experiences this but sometimes
[00:30:06.520] for me like when I do post on social media through my vacation,
[00:30:10.720] I might be thinking like oh what would look good on Instagram
[00:30:13.820] or like what would get more engagement and things like that.
[00:30:16.520] So then I think snapping photos just private photos did help
[00:30:20.620] me feel like I wasn't thinking about that stuff.
[00:30:24.120] I also think from my personal experiences if you're traveling
[00:30:28.820] if you're traveling alone, you don't have that like steady
[00:30:32.020] person who's traveling with you who can provide interaction
[00:30:36.520] with you whenever you need it or want it.
[00:30:39.520] So then posting on social media is like another way of interacting
[00:30:43.620] with people.
[00:30:44.320] That's true.
[00:30:44.920] So then I do notice that like me traveling with people in general
[00:30:50.420] versus alone social media usage increases more when I'm alone.
[00:30:55.720] That's a good point.
[00:30:56.420] Actually, I've never like really solo traveled so I wouldn't
[00:30:59.820] understand the feeling but I think you're right.
[00:31:01.820] Like there's a lot of enjoyment that comes from sharing like
[00:31:04.720] where you're at which is why usually on vacations.
[00:31:07.820] I love to like post about it and whatnot so I can see how it
[00:31:11.020] can fill that void when you're wanting some sort of interaction
[00:31:14.920] on solo travels.
[00:31:16.220] Yeah, because sometimes you're like, oh my god, this food is
[00:31:19.020] so good and then the world needs to know or just the person
[00:31:25.120] who I'm traveling with, you know?
[00:31:26.120] True.
[00:31:28.220] Like someone needs to know and whether it's forced down their
[00:31:31.920] throat because they're with me or if it's, you know, just put
[00:31:36.520] out there into the world as long as it has been released.
[00:31:42.320] Well besides taking photos as keepsakes from your honeymoon,
[00:31:46.520] was there any other way that you tried to like memorialize
[00:31:50.420] the trip?
[00:31:51.320] Yes, so I guess I kept going back to this idea of like, okay,
[00:31:56.420] this is like the honeymoon, you know, the once-in-a-lifetime
[00:32:00.520] allegedly honeymoon star.
[00:32:05.630] I kept feeling like one, the photos that we took I needed to
[00:32:11.230] look really good and I think in the past like traveling and
[00:32:15.230] stuff.
[00:32:15.530] I obviously would try to have nice outfits or whatnot.
[00:32:18.130] But this time I was like, okay, I'm going to bring all my
[00:32:20.830] skirts.
[00:32:21.530] I'll bring my nice shoes.
[00:32:22.830] I'll like really dress up buy new clothes and whatnot for
[00:32:25.830] this trip.
[00:32:26.330] So yeah, I really before the trip went out and bought new
[00:32:29.530] jeans, new cardigans, etc.
[00:32:32.430] For some unknown reason but the flip side of that was when
[00:32:36.930] we were actually on our honeymoon same thought like I was
[00:32:40.130] like, this is the honeymoon blah blah blah.
[00:32:42.530] I kept having this urge to like buy stuff and I would like
[00:32:45.830] pick something up something like a Christmas ornament or
[00:32:48.430] like a magnet or something and I'll turn to James and be
[00:32:50.430] like, oh my god, like we have to buy this and then this could
[00:32:53.130] be like the ornament or like the magnet we bought on our
[00:32:56.130] honeymoon.
[00:32:57.230] Then James is like, I don't know like that thing looks kind
[00:32:59.830] of fragile like, you know, I don't know if we want to bring
[00:33:02.330] something so big or so fragile like back to the US.
[00:33:05.130] I'd be like but this is our honeymoon.
[00:33:06.930] Like we have to document it somehow.
[00:33:10.630] So then it's similar to that urge of like I need to tell everyone
[00:33:14.330] we're on our honeymoon and get as much free stuff.
[00:33:16.430] Like I felt like I was constantly searching for like the
[00:33:19.330] thing to buy so that I could tell our children or whoever
[00:33:23.030] in the future like I bought this on our honeymoon.
[00:33:28.230] I'm imagining like you guys walk into some sort of art gallery
[00:33:32.930] and you see this giant piece of art.
[00:33:34.730] You're like we have to get this it'll be the centerpiece
[00:33:37.930] for our living room.
[00:33:38.930] And whenever someone asks or like it's from our honeymoon.
[00:33:43.530] Wait, literally that is like pretty much me just constantly
[00:33:47.230] bothering James like we have to buy this.
[00:33:49.530] He's like, please he's like, how will we bring it back?
[00:33:57.390] Okay.
[00:33:58.090] Also the worst part of this is the two things that I mentioned
[00:34:01.290] about buying stuff counteracts each other because as you can
[00:34:04.490] imagine if I'm trying to have this nice wardrobe and all these
[00:34:08.390] outfits and whatnot for the honeymoon our luggages were like
[00:34:12.090] packed.
[00:34:13.090] We brought one carry-on and one checked bag and both things
[00:34:16.490] were like pretty full already.
[00:34:18.390] And then anytime I wanted to like buy stuff James would be
[00:34:20.990] like, I don't even think we have like any room to bring shit
[00:34:25.090] back.
[00:34:27.390] So it was truly my two demons like battling each other.
[00:34:31.990] He's like we're gonna need another suitcase pretty much.
[00:34:36.490] But did you end up buying some sort of souvenir?
[00:34:41.390] So James didn't end up buying me some nice stuff from Paris,
[00:34:44.190] which was awesome two bags, which will be my honeymoon bags
[00:34:47.690] forever.
[00:34:48.690] And I really wanted to buy James stuff actually, but he is
[00:34:52.290] very much the type to not have any interest in something unless
[00:34:55.890] he absolutely loves it and then he'll have like complete
[00:34:58.990] dedication to the item.
[00:35:00.690] So when we're shopping around he didn't really find much that
[00:35:03.290] he liked but yeah now I have two things that I can call my
[00:35:07.490] honeymoon souvenirs.
[00:35:08.990] Dude, it's okay.
[00:35:09.690] So you have two bags one for you and the other one James can
[00:35:13.990] claim like you'll still be wearing it and using it but James
[00:35:18.390] can be like, oh yeah, that's my souvenir.
[00:35:23.690] True or his souvenir could be my happiness.
[00:35:29.490] Ooh, okay.
[00:35:30.190] Another question is because you know, it's like your honeymoon
[00:35:34.590] and the focus is you and James spending time together.
[00:35:39.290] Did you or did you not try to buy little souvenirs for friends
[00:35:43.890] and family because I know that's something that you and James
[00:35:46.890] often do when you go on trips.
[00:35:48.890] We did not stuff for you to actually we try to be like pretty
[00:35:53.390] strategic about it of like, you know, when we see the like the
[00:35:57.390] thing that we feel like is right just buy it versus I feel like
[00:36:00.190] in other vacations.
[00:36:01.490] Sometimes we like deliberate about it and whatnot.
[00:36:04.490] We definitely did pick up stuff for our friends and family.
[00:36:07.090] Wow, that's nice.
[00:36:08.490] I thought you two would be like no we will forego this this time,
[00:36:12.190] you know, we'll totally focus on ourselves and we don't need
[00:36:15.890] to think about our friends and family this time.
[00:36:19.490] I mean the stuff we bought isn't big but I think it's pretty
[00:36:22.590] similar to what we usually buy for friends and family ish.
[00:36:25.590] What I will say is that a part of me really wanted to get
[00:36:28.590] something special for like our parents.
[00:36:31.090] There was one thing in particular that I really want to buy
[00:36:33.490] which didn't end up working out because of inventory, but I
[00:36:36.490] wanted to buy a little music box from Switzerland for my dad
[00:36:40.390] which had the tune of like our father-daughter dance song,
[00:36:44.690] which is such a good idea.
[00:36:45.890] Yeah, I might order it off like Amazon or some shit.
[00:36:50.690] Yeah, you can still give the gift but it just won't be from
[00:36:53.190] Switzerland.
[00:36:54.190] Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:56.190] But yeah, I think just there were certain things that I feel
[00:36:59.890] like I was thinking about a lot on our trip, which was really
[00:37:02.990] like our family.
[00:37:04.990] I felt like I was constantly like thinking oh, I need to show
[00:37:07.490] my mom this photo later.
[00:37:09.090] And then I know James was sending his parents photos on WeChat
[00:37:13.590] and stuff throughout the trip too.
[00:37:15.090] Aw, that's nice.
[00:37:16.390] And I feel like if there's anyone to share photos with on your
[00:37:19.390] honeymoon, it's definitely like family.
[00:37:21.690] And this is like low-key a little weird but for some reason
[00:37:24.490] when like periodically throughout our honeymoon, I kept thinking
[00:37:27.990] about my parents on their honeymoon and my parents went to
[00:37:30.990] Guam for like maybe a week or so for their honeymoon.
[00:37:35.590] They kind of laughed when I said our honeymoon was two weeks.
[00:37:38.790] They were like, oh kids nowadays.
[00:37:40.190] They travel for so long, but it made me feel like weirdly
[00:37:43.890] emotional thinking about our parents on their honeymoon.
[00:37:48.890] I kept thinking about how different probably the styles of
[00:37:53.090] our trips would have been just because I think with the life
[00:37:55.990] that my parents were able to provide and whatnot, like I just
[00:37:59.690] probably have access to different types of traveling now, but
[00:38:03.690] also imagining them at like our age with this feeling of like
[00:38:08.590] oh now we're going to like tackle the world together.
[00:38:11.190] I just kept thinking we're like the same, you know, like I
[00:38:14.490] am my parents now.
[00:38:16.090] Wow.
[00:38:17.490] I wonder if my parents went on a honeymoon before because I
[00:38:20.990] think my parents they got married and then they like were
[00:38:24.090] like, all right, it's time to immigrate.
[00:38:26.890] They got shit to do.
[00:38:29.590] No rest for us.
[00:38:32.790] Yeah, I do feel like the concept of a honeymoon was maybe a
[00:38:35.690] little bit more like relaxed back then.
[00:38:37.990] Yeah, and Asia in general was just kind of a different environment
[00:38:41.390] during our parents time.
[00:38:42.590] True.
[00:38:43.090] Plus their traditions and stuff are not always going to be the
[00:38:46.190] same, right?
[00:38:47.990] But I'm so glad to hear that your honeymoon went so well.
[00:38:51.390] It sounds like you really set an intention for it and you
[00:38:55.690] accomplished that, you know feeling really connected with
[00:38:58.190] each other and focusing on that postmarital bliss even though
[00:39:03.790] it's four months later.
[00:39:05.190] I still get like a year right to be called a newlywed.
[00:39:10.290] Yeah, honestly considering that like you'll probably be married
[00:39:14.490] for the rest of your life.
[00:39:16.290] You can probably be called a newlywed for at least like three
[00:39:19.790] or four years.
[00:39:22.190] Wait true percentage wise, right?
[00:39:24.690] We can milk this for a little longer.
[00:39:26.490] Yeah, like for as long as a toddler is a toddler you are a
[00:39:30.490] newlywed.
[00:39:31.490] Until we hit marriage preschool.
[00:39:35.690] Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:39:37.190] Yeah, or I guess it's like once you have a kid then you might
[00:39:40.690] not be a newlywed anymore.
[00:39:42.790] Then I'll be a mom.
[00:39:43.990] Yeah.
[00:39:45.990] Well, thank you so much for sharing your honeymoon experience
