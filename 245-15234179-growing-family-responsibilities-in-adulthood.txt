[00:00:00.180] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo. I have a confusing Gen Z word for us to discuss today. Okay, actually, I'm not even sure if this is a Gen Z word. It might be Gen Alpha. At this point
[00:00:24.780] I'm not like sure where the slang is coming from anymore. But the word is Sigma and I only know part of it. I don't see it as much now on TikTok, but for a period of time
[00:00:39.020] I was seeing it a decent amount. And from my understanding, there's like the phrase alpha male right and like beta or whatever and so sigma is almost like an alternative to
[00:00:51.460] Alpha without the like baggage of that word almost. And I feel like when I do hear it being used It's a little more like sarcastic or maybe like ironic it definitely doesn't carry that like really heavily gendered or like
[00:01:08.220] baggage as I mentioned of the word alpha and I think it's supposed to be a good thing. Like if you're a Sigma character, you're supposed to be it's like kind of a positive thing slash like funny thing
[00:01:22.180] Do you actually didn't know like the connotations of the word Sigma that much but I Do see it used in the wild kind of like a synonym to alpha like you said or to Chad almost
[00:01:34.420] So it's like oh, he's a sigma male or like Sigma woman or whatever Just means that they're like really on top of like the food chain almost but this one is weird because I feel like I've also seen it evolve where
[00:01:48.580] Recently my husband went to go play like volleyball at open gym open gym has like a variety of different ages So some of the people he was playing with were Teenagers and he said that after getting like a score or something
[00:02:01.580] They would turn to each other and be like erm, what the Sigma and I was like wait, what the fuck? I've never heard that phrase in my life I Don't know this version of It has evolved beyond my comprehension
[00:02:20.380] The Sigma that I know it's connected to some Sigma face and the origin of the Sigma face Allegedly is from the movie American Psycho and apparently there's this one scene where Christian Bale actor he makes this like
[00:02:37.980] Weird kind of like eyebrow raise like purse-lipped face and people were saying like that's the Sigma face Do I've seen that and I remember for a period of time that was like all I could see on tik-tok just people doing the
[00:02:50.400] Sigma face same. I'm so curious how it evolved from that to like erm what the Sigma like what? What happened but I remember the evolution there at least as far as I saw There's Sigma Riz or something
[00:03:05.940] Whoa, and then that was kind of just being an independent person and like having yourself kind of put together And that's like the Sigma character that like has this like independent Riz kind of all ironic slash sarcastic In a way, that's like the extent of my Sigma knowledge
[00:03:25.500] Dude this is fascinating. I wish you could like get a gen alpha person on and just like grill their brain Okay, but sometimes some of these slang words just mean nothing like scooby-doo true scooby-doo toilet Riz
[00:03:40.340] Yeah, I swear I've seen a tik-tok of like people asking what scooby-doo means sometimes it's in games, right? They get matched with like these really young people who say it and they're like, what does that mean? And then the kids like dude, I don't know scooby-doo
[00:03:56.780] It's like a soundbite Dude, they're just playing us actually Well regardless of Sigma and scooby-doo Let's go to the real topic that we have for the episode today, which is taking the initiative with family
[00:04:10.940] I think one of the themes that we often mention when it comes to talking about family is that as children We just hold so much less responsibility But now that we are a little bit older a little bit more settled. We wanted to explore how
[00:04:26.380] We choose to be more active members of the family and what kind of new roles we take on Yeah, and I feel like now especially as more and more of us are living Independently of our parents a lot of decisions truly fall into our own
[00:04:42.100] Plates now, so I guess like one of the biggest and like most obvious choices that we're able to Take full control over is how often do you visit your parents if you're not living with them?
[00:04:56.260] Which is actually something that I've kind of been thinking about because as I mentioned a few months ago I felt ready to like move out from home and Luckily, I have succeeded
[00:05:07.860] I've succeeded in doing so and so now I'm kind of starting to find my new routine and figure out all these new things now that I'm
[00:05:17.100] Living on my own one of them is like how often should I go back home and you know, hang out with my parents? How do you find yourself determining these things I think for me my parents have moved around a little bit Since I've moved out the house
[00:05:33.860] So then how often I could visit them did really depend on where they were living at the time now They're obviously very very settled in Texas and I don't think they will leave anytime soon But for example when they were living in Korea for a bit
[00:05:50.180] I was like, okay once a year is how often I should go because otherwise it would be like financially a strain probably and especially With my income at the time. I was like, I can't afford
[00:06:00.260] Plane ticket more than that. And then when they were living on the East Coast I was thinking maybe like twice a year or so and now that they're in Texas. I think the flight time is a lot
[00:06:11.300] Closer, it's maybe like three and a half hours or something versus the almost six that it was to visit them in the East Coast
[00:06:17.580] So I kind of want to do more like weekend trips and whatnot, but realistically it's been about two to three times a year so far Yeah, I feel like it's pretty hard regardless of distance if they're just out of state, right?
[00:06:30.820] If you just have to take a flight it Exponentially increases the effort and like the planning for these trips. Yeah Mm-hmm. I could definitely feel that too when like I was in the East Coast and then you know, like coming back home
[00:06:47.100] it was usually just focused on the holidays because Otherwise regular timing is a little harder to plan around, you know work around PTO Days off. So I feel like when your parents were living in Korea
[00:07:01.700] That must have been the hardest time to like it's it's like so far that you're like, okay now I have to make this into Like basically a vacation, right?
[00:07:11.340] Yeah, true and maybe it was kind of easier in a sense because the decision was already pre-made it's like, okay I will go visit them and stay for like 10 days or something
[00:07:21.200] I feel like is almost the minimum that I would do if I were to go so far But now that they're in Texas, I feel like the distance is kind of shorter
[00:07:30.260] So then it puts me at this weird spot where I'm like, oh, I feel like I could just go and do like a weekend trip But then that means I'm not actually like booking the flights, you know I see and then it also
[00:07:40.600] Makes me think like, oh, maybe my parents should just come and visit me and like stay with us So then there's just like a lot of back and forth like way more
[00:07:48.280] Decisions and like things to consider versus when they were in Korea. It's like I will visit you and I will stay for 10 days Oh, yeah, that's a good point You actually bring up another interesting factor, which is like should your parents be visiting you too, right?
[00:08:03.520] And I guess the only thing that I kind of have to go off of this is Mainly like when I was younger my grandparents live in China So the model that I've like grown up with is literally, you know
[00:08:17.520] international travel and like the grandparents rarely come visit us in the States because they're getting older and like You know making those trips is harder for them or maybe they're just like really busy in China And they're like now we can't Just fly over
[00:08:34.280] So now it's different because my parents and your parents are not out of country, right? And so I guess we have to reestablish the normal that we know Yeah, totally
[00:08:46.280] and I feel like things will also change once we have kids and whatnot to like I always think about that because It's been on my mind a little bit more lately and I'm like, how will I? Know how to integrate
[00:08:59.520] grandparents into like the nuclear family lifestyle because like you said What I know and what I can reference is like my grandparents being in Korea
[00:09:08.080] So then if they were to visit they would stay for like a month or two or whatever or we would go and visit them But I don't know how it works for the grandparents being in a different state
[00:09:17.000] so all these new avenues to explore and not having a reference point means there's a lot of new processes that like you yourself have to set up Yeah, and I think I'm definitely in that
[00:09:28.360] Situation too now where I'm like thinking about the new norm to have like it's only been a short period of time since I've moved out so I'm still like figuring out what makes sense. And I mean luckily for me my parents are living quite close to me
[00:09:45.040] Right. It is very easy to just like drive over and hang out with them But kind of like you said sometimes the easier it is the more you're just like oh it's so easy
[00:09:55.640] I can do it later or like I can just do it whenever and then that ends up making you procrastinate And like not do anything right now, though I don't have a routine necessarily but because I'm sometimes like oh my god
[00:10:09.200] I need this one thing and it's actually back home. So I guess I'll just drive over on the weekend and grab it Leave That's so nice. Definitely super fortunate that I get to live by myself but also like super close to my parents and
[00:10:25.320] You know speaking of having kids and you know having grandparents in the nuclear family That was a thought that I had when I was younger growing up I was thinking like, you know, I love my grandparents a lot
[00:10:36.680] But I only get to see them probably like once a year and sometimes even less So I made a mental note when I was young that like oh I want to live somewhat close to my parents at least like the same country as my parents because that way
[00:10:51.240] You know if I were to have kids then they can be a bigger part of that kid's life, right? I know and it's so funny to like even think about these things more seriously now because I think when we're young
[00:11:04.320] It's so much more conceptual. Yeah, and then in your like 20s and 30s It's your real life like you're impending future essentially But it's so nice because I know at least seeing my mom and her relationship with her mom
[00:11:17.640] there's just so much that you're unable to like share with your parents when they're overseas and You know, you want to cherish the moments that you're together, but maybe that means on the day-to-day you're not necessarily able to like rely on them or
[00:11:32.080] You're not able to support them that much except just like sending money or something like that So then it is a really big privilege to be able to live in the same country as your parents for sure
[00:11:43.320] Speaking of sharing things with your parents. How do you decide like what you? Share with your family, like you said sometimes it's harder to share the day-to-day things with them
[00:11:53.880] Especially if you're not seeing them like every day or weekly so like some things I think about is oh I guess now, you know if I were to just go out and travel for like a quick weekend trip
[00:12:05.280] Do I even communicate with that with my parents like I don't have to and it's like so weird sometimes to think of that Like almost severed like line of communication Do I know I feel like when you live with someone there's just so much
[00:12:18.560] Small like day-to-day communication that you do and the ones you don't live with them anymore You're like, whoa, I have to like manually update Yeah, like if you know, I'm living with my parents any sort of travel
[00:12:31.040] They'll have to know cuz I can't just like not show up at home for a weekend They'll be like wait, what is going on? Like where are you? Are you okay? So it's like, you know a quick
[00:12:39.880] Hey, I might be out this weekend versus now. It's like well, they don't see me every day So if I were to just like be out for a weekend They wouldn't know but I could like send them a text if they really wanted to know I guess
[00:12:53.080] so one of the things that kind of helped I Think ease the minds of me and my parents is we all track each other's locations
[00:13:03.040] So my mom and I have iPhones so we have each other on by my friends and then my dad has an Android so I track him or we track each other on Google Maps and
[00:13:11.600] I just feel so much better about it. And I think they do too because sometimes when life is really busy I don't always have the headspace to like text my parents and be like, oh like I'm doing this
[00:13:22.160] Or I might talk about a trip more vaguely like oh, I'm gonna go to Europe for two weeks or something like that, right? I think by using find my friends. My mom was like able to text me throughout the honeymoon
[00:13:33.080] Like oh, I see you guys are in Paris now or like I see you guys got to Switzerland safely And then she knows that I'm safe and well and like still traveling Yeah, and then on the other side
[00:13:43.520] I also worry about my parents and I'm also like oh my god My mom's not picking up and or like she hasn't called me back and it's been like six hours
[00:13:51.800] Like usually she calls me back. I wonder what's up? And then I check the location and I see that she's at home so like there's Ways, you know or like little checkpoints to assure each other of our safety
[00:14:02.720] Without having to constantly be texting or calling each other. Yeah, that has been super big That makes a lot of sense. Honestly, okay I have a weird find my friends situations with my parents
[00:14:14.800] Back in the day when iPhones first were like starting at big and find my friends first came out My parents did use find my friends on me to make sure that I was getting home safely after school because they couldn't pick me
[00:14:28.880] Up, so I usually just like walked home or biked home But then after a while, we just stopped using it because I guess like high school ended And Then the roles have been reversed now kind of like what you said, right now
[00:14:42.800] I'm worrying about like where my parents are So I actually added my mom onto my find my friends So that I can like track her sometimes if I don't know where she is or like she's getting home really late
[00:14:56.440] But then I haven't added my dad and so that has caused some issues Because one time when my mom was like on a trip or something and it was just me and my dad at home
[00:15:05.760] I got home like a Friday evening after work and it gets to like 8 or 9 p.m And I'm like, oh that's weird. Like normally my dad is home by like 8 ish I wonder where he is and I was like, okay
[00:15:17.320] I'll give it like an hour before I like start to worry and then you know an hour passes and he's still not home I'm like, okay. This is definitely Getting to the weird territory because my dad's like bedtime is literally around 1030
[00:15:33.760] So, how is he still not home? It's like almost 11 and so I call him but it goes straight to voicemail I'm like, that's when I start to like freak out about my oh my god, where could he be? Yeah, and I'm thinking in my head like okay
[00:15:47.360] There is a slight possibility that my dad could be out like camping or something because he likes to camp But I was like, but he never told me so I'm like, I can't be sure So I'm like, okay, I'll give it another 20 minutes before I call again
[00:16:02.680] Like maybe he just doesn't have service right now So I wait 20 minutes and I give another call and then this time he does pick up and I'm like, oh my god
[00:16:09.400] Like where are you? What's going on? Are you okay? Are you coming home today? And he was like, oh crystal I'm like climbing Mount Shasta right now Just casually And I was like wait What? He was like, yeah, don't worry about me
[00:16:24.400] Like I'll be home in about a day or so climbing Mount Shasta with some friends right now. I was like, okay So I hang up I'm like, okay. Well now at least I know where he is, but I'm just like why didn't you tell me?
[00:16:36.720] Dude, it's truly role reversal. Like it sounds like you have to establish some ground rules You might need to actually ground him for a week It turns out it was a last-minute trip because I don't know there was like a couple weeks where
[00:16:54.040] there was news about like potentially being able to see the northern lights in like North America and so Him and his friends were like, hey, let's go climb Mount Shasta to see if we can see the northern lights
[00:17:05.600] So when he came back, he like showed me the pictures. I was like cool They're like fuck it I'm down Fuck it. We ball But I think he like realized he was like, oh shoot I forgot to tell crystal that time
[00:17:22.040] I don't know. I think like two weeks later He went on another hiking trip like an overnight camping slash hiking trip So that time he did tell me in advance on Thursday
[00:17:31.720] He was like, oh by the way crystal like me and my friends should be camping this weekend So I'll probably be gone like Friday Saturday. I was like, okay. Thanks for letting me know You're like I approve this PTM
[00:17:47.270] Yeah, I'm like how could you just leave me alone with no communication Dude I feel like the communication is so key though. I've definitely had times where my mom was like, whoa How come you're in this city this weekend? Like what are you guys doing?
[00:18:01.870] Because I think we were driving down to like mammoth and I forgot to tell her we were going skiing So she saw like our location in the mountains. She's like, are you guys good? Like please tell me you're skiing
[00:18:11.630] And then vice versa like sometimes if I see my mom or my dad out late It's hard to not think like the worst like I think especially because I'm a more anxious prone person
[00:18:20.590] I see their location or I see that they haven't responded and I'm immediately like, okay, they're not okay panic. Yeah But now that you are moved out
[00:18:29.030] Do you think you'll continue to update your parents on if you're going out on any trips and whatnot, dude? I don't know. I Think yes, if it's like a big trip And then if it's like an overnight trip
[00:18:42.790] I think it might depend on where to and like how far and with who I guess You know probably if it's an out-of-state trip, I'll give them a little heads up
[00:18:53.990] but I'm imagining like I don't know if it were you know, like a little day trip to Monterey or like a One night two day trip to like Monterey Maybe not just because that's like, you know relatively small of a trip, right?
[00:19:08.150] But yeah, I'm still kind of gauging what to share versus what not to share but I think definitely like international trips is a yes and Flights that are longer than like two hours is probably
[00:19:21.070] That's true, like if you're flying out somewhere to a different city that makes sense I guess I'm at the same time also trying to gauge what the correct amount of
[00:19:31.390] Just general communication is in the past when I was farther at school college or you know in New York I would try to call my parents maybe every one to two weeks But now it's like we're so close that almost feels excessive, you know
[00:19:51.270] It's like I guess I could just drive over and talk to you for an hour versus like FaceTime you for an hour So definitely still figuring out that level of communication and I feel like that would also Help establish like how much I'm sharing with them, too
[00:20:07.830] That's true and that makes me reflect back on My parents like different living locations to and what our system was and I think the further we were It would be phone calls and then the closer we were it would be text messages
[00:20:22.230] Because when you're far like especially when we were doing like me in California and my parents in Korea There's only like a certain window of the day that you can actually communicate So then just talking on the phone really quick
[00:20:33.510] I think would be more efficient versus when you're close like there's way more hours in the day that you can actually be talking and I Like the questions that come up are like smaller questions, too
[00:20:43.630] It's like oh, can you tell me how you do this or like, you know? What we get is better for you while like way more coordinating stuff versus when you're far like it's like how have you been?
[00:20:52.270] You know like deeper conversations maybe or like even the more serious conversations like have to happen with that distance So maybe you can try texting with your parents more that's a good point
[00:21:03.750] I did invite my mom over for dinner like the other day and we were just texting like oh What time do you want to come? It's like what what is your schedule work? Wait, also I asked my mom
[00:21:14.110] I was like what time do you want to come and she's like depends on your time and I was like How about 630 and she was like, how about six? I Was like, oh, okay six works
[00:21:33.190] She's like bargaining time with me she made you feel like you had the power But yeah, I think you're right like in those situations it's like quick problem-solving
[00:21:45.870] So it's just like sending a text is totally fine or sometimes she'll text and be like, hey you got this letter in the mail I'll put it on your desk. Okay, you left your water bottle here, right?
[00:21:56.870] What I find really interesting though is I don't know if you've had this experience, but sometimes when you talk to Parents or like friends of your parents or other people's family friends, etc
[00:22:07.950] Like the adults, I feel like they always have commentary about their kids and how often they come home. Oh I've you know heard parents to be like, oh, yeah, like, you know my son or my daughter like they never come home
[00:22:21.190] They never come visit me blah blah or the opposite like oh my son or daughter They're texting me every fucking day Like always asking me how to make one dish or another and I think that also influences how I see Like my relationship with my parents as well
[00:22:36.510] Like I'm always like if my parents were to describe their like communication cadence with me How would they say it like would I be the daughter that never comes home or would I be the daughter that like Texts too much during the week
[00:22:49.910] Whoa, I guess I never thought too much about that The way that I have thought about it is that my parents have never complained about the amount of times I go home So I just assume I'm on a good level right now. I
[00:23:06.470] Did have to have a talk with my mom though because I think for a period of time this year We were like barely communicating and I was like feeling pretty sad about it So the other day I called her and I was like, okay mom
[00:23:17.710] I think we need to call each other at least once a week Like that's like the bare minimum for me and then she was like, okay, and then she texted me later She was like, yeah so I talked about it with your dad and I
[00:23:29.430] Had floated the like concept of oh How come GC wants to talk on the phone so much or like what do we even have to like talk about on the phone? Oh my god, and your dad gave me like an earful. Like he was scolding me
[00:23:41.570] So I repent and I'm sorry like we should talk Wait, that's so funny. It's another role reversal where you're like, um, we need to you need to be calling me like That's like literally what my mom said to me when I like when we first went to college
[00:23:59.230] She's like crystal make sure to call me like at least once one or two weeks Dude, yeah Cuz my mom is very much the type of person or like the type of mom who she's like I don't want to bother you like you live your own life
[00:24:12.270] Like I'm hands-off if you need me I'm here like and I'll always pick up but I'm not gonna force you on some sort of cadence But unluckily for her I am the type of daughter where I'm like, I need a cadence and I need to talk to you
[00:24:25.790] Yeah Wait, I feel like that's so funny that your mom was like, what are we even gonna talk about? She was like, yeah, I told my best friend too and she got really mad It's so funny too because my mom is very good about calling like my grandma
[00:24:47.150] Oh my god, like she'll call my grandma once a week and I'm like, well, what do you guys talk about? She's like, oh I already talked it all through with your grandma so I
[00:25:02.550] Guess she is also thinking about herself. She's like, oh I need to be entertaining for Jisoo But you're like you're like don't worry. I already have so many topics for us to talk Like here's the tea that your weekly digest I
[00:25:20.110] Don't know I've kind of been thinking about it because There's only so many updates that I have on the weekly like there are some weeks where my life is maybe more exciting or more dynamic and then other weeks where it's like a
[00:25:31.350] Maintenance week or like a routine week like here the things that I did are very mundane and normal, so I was kind of like Should I think of new things that we could do together? You know how like people in long-distance relationships
[00:25:44.270] So maybe pick up like a video game together or they'll like watch a movie together So I'm like should I be doing that with my mom? Oh That's so funny
[00:25:53.470] But I feel like a show could be a good one like you watch it on your own time and then you like discuss it In the phone call like oh my god. Did you watch the newest episode? That's true
[00:26:02.990] so I did start watching the lovely runner because my mom was like This is so good, and I refuse to watch your dating reality TV shows like fine. I'll watch your drama But
[00:26:13.550] Honestly, I was like talking to a friend recently and she has been playing a lot of Stardew Valley co-op with her boyfriend And I was like, whoa, my mom loves Stardew Valley and I'm also us Yeah
[00:26:24.710] My mom used to I got her on it during COVID and she was at one point playing on her phone I had and her MacBook like three different ways. She's a gamer Yeah
[00:26:35.950] And I was like should me and my mom play Stardew Valley co-op. Oh my god. Wait, that would be so funny She could show you around her farm Yeah. Yeah, dude. Imagine I'm like mom get on discord. She's like, okay Wait, that's wholesome as hell. I
[00:26:53.470] Don't know I think like this is also a not just a long-distance thing But even when you live close by to your parents Do you ever think of activities that you want to do with them when you go back and visit or even when you were just spending
[00:27:06.430] Time together when you were at home To be honest, not really the most is maybe like meals to eat like oh my Parents would totally enjoy if we ate hot pot maybe yeah, or like I would enjoy this meal and my parents need to tag Or
[00:27:28.710] Sometimes it's like oh I heard this restaurants really good I should probably take my parents to it or sometimes it's like oh Maybe I can make like cook this meal for my parents. So it's very food centered
[00:27:39.630] For me. Yeah, I think like all most of the activities I think of are like very food centered hmm I mean actually that makes a lot of sense because that's how I think food is often a currency or like token of love in Asian households
[00:27:53.030] I'm just like an unspoken way to like enjoy each other's company and whatnot I know when we go to visit James's mom Sometimes we'll bring our little like Korean barbecue grill that home plug-in one
[00:28:04.510] Yeah, and then we'll find different things to grow and do like a KBBQ night in or something like that So I think those are very special memories, too. Yeah, that's super nice Sometimes it's also like simple things like sometimes I tag along with my mom to Costco
[00:28:20.630] And I feel like that makes her very happy because I would say on average she probably ends up going to Costco alone Sometimes my dad joins her but sometimes she's going on the weekdays
[00:28:31.750] So, you know like we're at work and she's she's like, okay quick before Costco gets too crowded Let me like, you know And so I think there's definitely been some times where I tag along with her and I can tell that she's like
[00:28:44.590] Excited that I'm there because she'll be like, oh, is there anything you want? Like, you know throw it in the throw it in the cart if you want it and I made her buy me like hella socks But like 20 pack of stuff they sell at Costco
[00:29:00.470] And I think it's so cute too because like I think you've mentioned your mom does something similar along these lines We're like if my mom's out at Costco or shopping sometimes she sees something and she'll take a photo of it and send it to me and be like
[00:29:12.270] Oh, do you need this? Like do you want this? And I'm like, oh, don't worry mom Like I'm good but I'm always like all that's so nice that she's like, you know still thinking about me and
[00:29:20.430] Yeah, like clearly like oh my god does Crystal need this now that she's like, you know out on her own Do I know even when I go visit my parents in Texas the first day that I go
[00:29:32.190] I always like come with some sort of gift or whatever and then my mom will go into her magic closet and come out with Like oh, I bought this like golf dress
[00:29:39.630] Do you want it or like I bought these socks because I thought of you and it's like it's like the cutest thing Dude, yeah And I feel like there's almost times where I have to reel them in
[00:29:48.710] You know where I'm like, don't worry about it. Like you don't need to spend all this money on me. I'm good and It's once again kind of that role reversal we've talked about
[00:29:58.310] So I feel like another thing is the older we get and like the more independent we get the more Roles of responsibility we take on even if we're not, you know living in the same household as our parents anymore so I guess like one example is
[00:30:14.750] Kind of like I mentioned how I'm constantly thinking about like food centric activities But I will try to maybe like step up and take charge of that So like oh guys I found this restaurant let's go eat here on Friday
[00:30:29.470] So kind of like, you know taking that leadership role to get an event to happen Do you find yourself taking on more of these like roles of responsibility as well?
[00:30:39.550] I think a little bit and probably when I feel it the most is when my parents come to visit me and they're staying at Like our house. I'm kind of like whoa because I'm so used to staying at my parents house and they're like the
[00:30:52.110] Controllers of the house early, you know Like they're like the people who know the house the best and like they like my mom's kitchen is organized how she wants it And etc, etc When my parents come to our place
[00:31:02.270] Any questions that they have about the house or whatnot like they would direct that to myself and James right or like even the kitchen It's like organized just the way I like it in the way that it's useful and convenient for me to cook
[00:31:14.190] That always makes me feel a little bit weird where I'm like, whoa they're like in my space and to be honest sometimes it's The gap between what I'm used to and the gap between what I'm experiencing at the moment makes it almost uncomfortable
[00:31:27.950] Where I'm kind of like not used to the situation. So then it brings up like weird energy sometimes I see so that I remember when my parents first came and visited
[00:31:36.950] I would get kind of snippy and stuff because they were in my space and it was like really weird And I think I just didn't have the maturity to like be able to handle that situation
[00:31:47.030] Hopefully now I kind of do but I just remember thinking like wow, this is a little bit odd. Mm-hmm Wait, I think I totally get what you mean. You're like not used to having them there
[00:31:56.790] Yeah, so sometimes you like act out in ways you didn't even need to Exactly. Like I remember one of the things we fought about was I mean first of all, it's like when parents come over
[00:32:07.510] I feel like what they do is like they clean your space and I was like, okay mom Like you're here to relax like I don't want you to think that you have to clean this whole time Like just sit there and relax, please
[00:32:18.510] Yeah, and then I think the other instinct is like, oh my god Like, you know, I have all this stuff at my house But Jesus doesn't have it here
[00:32:26.110] like you totally need this whole sewing kit and like, you know, I'll buy it and like stock up your so I'm like Don't be like you don't need to buy these things Like we don't have that much space like just just don't buy these things Yeah
[00:32:38.790] So I think that is definitely a responsibility too, right? like being the keeper of your space sort of and then learning to Fit your parents into that routine when they visit and I'm sure maybe on your parents and to they're feeling a little awkward
[00:32:52.590] Like what do I do with my hands? Like what can I touch and what can I not touch I Also had an experience where my mom was like visiting me in my space and I was like this is kind of weird
[00:33:07.350] and it was like back in New York and she was like Oh I'm gonna come to New York for like a few days and she told me kind of late because it was a bit of a last Minute decision and I was like, oh my god
[00:33:18.790] I mean, yes, you can come but I'm also like oh shoot. I have like I'm actually busy on this one day I guess I didn't I didn't feel as prepared and so when my mom came she was like, yeah
[00:33:29.190] I'll just like stay at your apartment and I was like my tiny New York apartment So I was like, okay mom like you need to sleep on the bed. I'll sleep on the couch
[00:33:39.710] You know all this stuff and she was like dude, don't worry like I can sleep on the couch and I was like no Like stop saying that go sleep on the bed. I Think at one point I was kind of like dang like you came out like a
[00:33:55.510] Unfortunate time because I'm busy like I can't be with you like this whole time and she's like dude It's not that big of a deal. Like I could just go explore by myself
[00:34:04.830] Like don't worry about it. And also like your uncle and cousin are here and I'll go hang out with them and I was like Okay, fine, but like blah blah and she's like, all right, you need to calm down like She was like, okay
[00:34:17.550] I can see that you're a little stressed because you wanted me to visit at like the perfect time where you have like all the amenities for me but like you don't Need a stress like it's fine. I can sleep on the couch if you
[00:34:29.550] You know, I was like no stop you're definitely sleeping on the bed But yes What you said is correct and I feel like that is just another like taking on responsibility where you're like, oh my god
[00:34:39.510] I need everything to be like perfect for my parents because they've always been like trying to make things Perfect or like really suited to me I know it's like one of those things that I think causes a lot of friction too because it's not quite the perfect
[00:34:55.430] Reversal where it's not like suddenly our parents are children and we're the parents but it almost feels like we should be able to take on that responsibilities
[00:35:03.350] So I think it almost feels like when we're not fully able to commit to that swap because of one reason or another We just feel bad We're like this is not the way that I wanted it to because you know
[00:35:12.750] I think similar to how you probably felt I was also like oh I don't want my house to be a space where my mom feels obligated to do these things or she feels
[00:35:21.950] Obligated to like fill these voids like I want her to come and be perfectly relaxed and like Perfectly enjoy and be pampered and leave but it's not always quite like that. The pampered part is so
[00:35:34.550] Key as well. You're like you need to just relax. I will cook all the meals, you know I'll do all the housework that you usually do right? But then I guess like maybe it's just so deeply ingrained in them
[00:35:46.110] They're like no I can help you like it's not a big deal and you're like no sit back down. Yeah Like mom get away from the kitchen like put the cutting board Stop opening the fridge Well, honestly
[00:36:02.430] I feel like this episode was so wholesome and it really makes me look back on Even some of these funny moments with our parents where we might have felt frustrated or you know feeling weird in our transition from being that baby of the family to being a
[00:36:16.710] slightly older member of the family Like capturing more responsibility and Also like taking charge of you know These lines of communication as we mentioned and making more decisions, you know when to visit our parents. It's so interesting
[00:36:34.070] we have like so much more power now, and I feel like it's definitely a long Period of transition that we go through and find the like right balance So it's very interesting to chat about it since we're both kind of in the middle of it
[00:36:48.670] But you're maybe a little further along in your journey, and I'm still a little early on in my journey of that balance so thanks so much for chatting today about our increased responsibilities Within the family and for our listeners out there if you have any thoughts about these
