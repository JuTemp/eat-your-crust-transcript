[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. Today, before we dive into our topic, we do have a slang word to discuss. I think today's word is pretty funny. You and I actually use it a decent amount right now. I hear it a lot. And I think its use has been pretty consistent so far over the course of like this year. And the word is glaze.
[00:00:37.780] So the way glaze is used is to actually mean to pile on compliments, essentially. It kind of refers to like a glazed donut. Like you're adding the glaze onto a donut to like really just send it home that this is great.
[00:00:55.980] And I think this word has especially been topical for Crystal and I since we've been playing fantasy, as many of you guys know. Every week, someone will be like, oh, this person's team looks so good. I'm so scared to play them. They're racking up all the points. Inevitably, someone else would comment like, dude, stop glazing this person's team.
[00:01:15.420] So I think its usage is so versatile. There's a ton of glazing going on in this world. I feel like I've seen it refer to more serious issues as well. Because, you know, there's a ton of glazing, a ton of people making someone look or seem better than it might actually be.
[00:01:33.760] Yeah. And I think it's definitely used a lot in exaggeration, but I think sometimes it's well-deserved too. So I see it a lot in like the gaming community or as you said, in fantasy football, because the app that we use has really good commentability features.
[00:01:51.880] So every crazy play, people can make comments about it. For example, this past week, there was this crazy game where someone played just an amazing fantasy game and scored like one of the highest points ever. The comments are super funny, but they're also definitely like glazing. So one of the top comments is literally like, I assume this is what sex feels like.
[00:02:19.400] Those are examples of like, well-deserved glaze. But you're right, there's definitely also the other side where it's way more exaggerated and people like to call each other out like, hey, stop glazing this person or whatever.
[00:02:32.820] Right. And my personal favorite is when it might not be a glaze, like you're not intending for it to be a glaze, but then things happen. And then in hindsight, you realize it was a glaze.
[00:02:42.860] So one example is like a football player pops off one week and you're like, holy shit, this guy's so good. You're showering him with compliments. And then a couple of weeks later, you've realized it was all foam and bubbles and he's not actually that good.
[00:02:56.920] Or just fantasy wise, he's underperforming to where your expectations were.
[00:03:01.060] Yeah.
[00:03:01.760] So then people would be like, yeah, all you guys fucking glazed this dude a couple of weeks ago. And now he's putting out like one to two fantasy points a week.
[00:03:10.460] Like, so hindsight declaration of something being a glaze is just also hilarious.
[00:03:15.660] Yes. I see it a lot in the gaming community too. People make cool plays or if they, you know, play a game and they performed really well. So very similar to like fantasy football.
[00:03:26.160] And then maybe the casters or people who are watching or like Twitch chat or whoever, they'll be like, holy shit, like you're so good. This person's crazy. And then everyone's like W glaze or something.
[00:03:41.590] Dude, it's so funny. And this is actually my favorite type of slang word where it's like a real word. It's in the dictionary. It has been a commonly used English word for a long time.
[00:03:52.190] But this extra layer and like dimension that the slang definition adds is just so funny. Like W glaze is hilarious.
[00:04:01.370] Yeah. Also like another common way people use glaze is to add self in front of it. So sometimes if you're like pumping yourself up, then people be like self glaze. Like whether that's a good thing or bad thing depends on their tone of voice.
[00:04:18.490] Yes. Well, all I'll say is that once you hear this word and once you hear the definition of it, I feel like you see it more and more often.
[00:04:27.030] So I guess if this is new to any of our listeners, you'll definitely start seeing this everywhere.
[00:04:31.810] It's a fun one.
[00:04:33.230] Well, let's move into the topic that we actually have today, which is tips we've picked up from former bosses.
[00:04:40.070] So we are both, I guess it's around six years into our career and have had a handful of different bosses.
[00:04:48.030] It's so funny because I think especially early on in your career, the mannerisms and the stylistic choices and the habits that your boss has is a lot easier to pick up for us.
[00:04:59.470] I think as newbies, especially since we don't have our own specific working style developed yet.
[00:05:05.210] So I am very excited to see what kind of tips that you've picked up from your bosses.
[00:05:09.030] So you're saying we're glazing our bosses?
[00:05:13.310] Honestly, it's not always a glaze.
[00:05:15.370] I think it could go either way, actually.
[00:05:17.250] But I will say, even if you have a boss that you might not fit in with or prefer, there's always something that you learn from your boss.
[00:05:26.850] Very true.
[00:05:27.530] To start us off, I did actually have a not great boss for a little bit.
[00:05:33.190] And you're right, I did learn a lot from that situation.
[00:05:36.970] One of the most important things I learned in that situation was how to recognize a boss that didn't work well with me and why.
[00:05:46.870] I think the biggest reason was that I was still pretty young in my career and I just didn't feel like I was learning.
[00:05:54.690] I felt very stagnant and my thought was, this can't be everything.
[00:06:00.850] I am so fresh in the workforce.
[00:06:04.290] I can't just be like sitting here twiddling my thumbs.
[00:06:07.370] I should at least be feeling I'm learning from even just watching or attending meetings or like seeing events.
[00:06:18.170] Just anything that I can learn from.
[00:06:20.330] But I realized that I was just sitting there and it was comfortable too, right?
[00:06:25.350] It was like I could sit there and like quietly read books in the corner of my screen and just like not even have to do much all day.
[00:06:35.230] And I was realizing like this is not good.
[00:06:38.130] Maybe I would want to be this chill later in life, but at this age I should be trying to improve, learning the ropes, really just like setting myself up for future successes.
[00:06:51.190] And so I really started to contemplate if it was time to leave, even if it meant leaving early.
[00:06:57.190] Before the typical suggested like stay at least a year.
[00:07:02.850] Do you think there was anything that your boss could have done or was maybe not doing that could have helped your situation?
[00:07:11.470] Because I think sometimes the problem is the work itself and then half the time it's like the boss, right?
[00:07:17.810] Right.
[00:07:18.330] I think the boss had not been a manager yet.
[00:07:22.930] And I'm just going to blame it on like the chain of command.
[00:07:26.170] I think that this company didn't have as much structure as some of the bigger corporations that I've been a part of.
[00:07:34.730] So I could really see through that very quickly that this person became a manager and they didn't really know what to do in terms of assigning projects, career check-ins.
[00:07:48.270] I don't know, I guess like general manager duties.
[00:07:52.370] So I could see through it pretty quickly, especially because in previous jobs, even like internships, I could see this chain of command and my managers would have control and confidence in utilizing me.
[00:08:07.950] And I think I noticed I was like, oh, like, did I even need to be hired?
[00:08:12.650] It just feels like I am sitting here doing nothing.
[00:08:16.270] Maybe sometimes I get work and then I provide my draft or whatever.
[00:08:21.110] And then my manager couldn't quite express what they wanted changed.
[00:08:26.450] So instead, they just redid the whole thing on their own.
[00:08:30.310] Oh, my God.
[00:08:31.170] From there, you know, you don't learn.
[00:08:32.670] You don't know why it had to be redone.
[00:08:34.910] You don't know what you should do differently next time.
[00:08:37.650] It's also frustrating because then you're like, oh, well, which project will get accepted and like which one is just going to get like quietly redone with no explanation.
[00:08:47.150] So it was like a very interesting situation.
[00:08:50.070] That is interesting.
[00:08:51.210] I feel like one being so green in your career, you want to be utilized as much as possible and learning and absorbing as much as possible.
[00:08:59.490] So I can see how the lack of feedback and structure is so dampening in terms of like, oh, I'm a brand new 22 year old.
[00:09:07.450] I just want to learn everything.
[00:09:08.850] It's interesting because I feel like what I've learned from a not bad boss, but probably more of like an incompatible boss was almost the opposite.
[00:09:18.910] So I have had bosses that are a little bit more helicoptery where they are constantly nitpicking on certain things or unable to like release you to be independent.
[00:09:35.090] Kind of.
[00:09:35.690] I think it was just an interesting contrast because one of the bosses that I've had a little bit more early on in my career was really someone who helped me be more independent in the workplace.
[00:09:46.930] Someone who had full trust in me and would back me up when I needed it.
[00:09:51.330] But if he thought I would be fine, then he would just let me run big meetings, speak to really big higher ups, etc.
[00:09:57.850] So I felt like I gained so much confidence as well as just like these things that you pick up from communicating with leadership and whatnot.
[00:10:08.290] So I just felt very important and also useful.
[00:10:12.110] Yeah.
[00:10:13.090] So in contrast, this other boss who was nitpicking a little bit more on like stylistic stuff and just had a lot of structure that I think benefited this boss, but maybe not so much me.
[00:10:26.290] I was just kind of like, whoa, this is like a really big change.
[00:10:29.610] So I think it's always interesting to see what that sweet spot is in terms of what your personal needs are.
[00:10:34.950] And then trying to find that compromising middle ground with what your boss needs, because everyone has different preferences and whatnot.
[00:10:41.870] But I think at the end of the day, it needs to be benefiting both of you and not just one person.
[00:10:48.230] Definitely.
[00:10:48.550] I think it's very interesting, too, because in my example, because I felt so stagnant, I started to try to find ways that I could be helpful to the company in other areas or how I could insert my skills somehow.
[00:11:04.850] And so it's kind of funny because I ended up bonding with this other person in the company and basically working for them for maybe like 30 percent of my work.
[00:11:18.490] I also kind of like forced my way into creating some projects that my manager wasn't capable of creating.
[00:11:26.250] I ended up having to like almost make a role for myself and like, you know, find myself another pseudo manager.
[00:11:33.850] But as things were kind of starting to settle, I found a new job.
[00:11:38.230] And then my manager was like, oh, like, is there any way we can keep you at this company?
[00:11:43.650] And in my mind, I was just like, no, no, because I had to work so hard just to carve out these roles.
[00:11:52.690] But I still don't feel like I have a mentor figure or someone who I could be, you know, gaining more insight from.
[00:12:01.150] And this new opportunity would provide that.
[00:12:04.190] And so it was kind of a choice between working through ambiguity, but maybe more ambiguity than what's typical versus going to a place with more structure and learning from that first before I enter.
[00:12:18.030] If I ever wanted to another company that has less structure and more ambiguity.
[00:12:24.810] I like that this is like a two-pronged lesson then for you.
[00:12:28.010] One, knowing what to do if you're not feeling fulfilled at work and not getting handed projects that you need.
[00:12:34.590] And also to just knowing when to leave, drawing the boundary of when enough is enough.
[00:12:38.850] Yeah, it was a little scary because I don't know if this is still the narrative, but I remember when we were getting out of college, the narrative was always try to stay at a job for at least a year.
[00:12:50.590] Right.
[00:12:51.150] Ideally, maybe like a year and a half or two years so that you could get a promo.
[00:12:55.310] And then if you want to like hop around, go ahead.
[00:12:59.010] And I ended up leaving before 12 months.
[00:13:02.870] I think it was actually like only eight months before I left.
[00:13:06.510] So I was kind of like, oh, I don't know.
[00:13:08.630] This is like maybe a little risky.
[00:13:10.250] I don't know if I'll get jobs.
[00:13:11.530] I don't know if the new job will pan out.
[00:13:13.530] All that kind of stuff.
[00:13:14.510] But it ended up okay.
[00:13:16.270] So it all worked out.
[00:13:18.750] I mean, I feel like at the end of the day, there's going to be people who are more strict about that kind of, you know, one to two years rule.
[00:13:25.130] But if you're able to explain why or address it promptly without having to go into the details, I feel like it's fine.
[00:13:32.350] As long as you don't have like a pattern of like leaving every six months, I feel like it's also okay.
[00:13:37.490] True.
[00:13:37.970] So how about those times when you had a really good boss?
[00:13:42.010] Were there any tips or lessons that you learned from them?
[00:13:46.150] Yeah.
[00:13:46.490] So one of the tips that I learned was kind of like an analyst staple and it's called the sniff test.
[00:13:54.710] I feel like it sounds a little bit nasty because the word sniff is like slightly gross to me.
[00:13:59.970] But basically what it means is as an analyst or a numbers person, you are often doing things like projections.
[00:14:07.970] And when you project something, you want to make sure that it makes sense and passes like basic checkpoints before you start sharing these numbers out to people.
[00:14:18.170] That's essentially what the sniff test is.
[00:14:20.570] Does it make sense?
[00:14:21.650] And I think it sounds kind of stupid because it's like, yeah, of course you want your project to make sense.
[00:14:26.170] But when you're actually deep into the weeds, crunching numbers, looking at things that are sometimes like really big data sets, you are looking at each step making sense.
[00:14:35.650] But when you come to the final product, which is like whatever your projection is, you also want to make sure that it fits into the big picture bold.
[00:14:43.530] So the sniff test is very important to be able to take a step back after you're done spending however long you have spent looking at the data and making sure that it all fits into this big narrative.
[00:14:55.650] And I think part of what my job is, is very much like storytelling.
[00:14:59.650] I think with whatever data set, you can pull out bits and pieces and kind of like cherry pick info as you want to.
[00:15:06.650] But the number itself is significantly less important than the actual story that you're trying to tell and prove.
[00:15:14.610] So the sniff test is something that I actually think about like every day.
[00:15:19.430] That makes sense.
[00:15:20.810] And immediately what I thought of was you don't want someone in the meeting to be like, something smells fishy about this.
[00:15:31.130] Exactly.
[00:15:32.670] But yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:34.570] I think I have something similar, you know, if you're editing a video or like creating some graphic, you want to like take a break and then look at it the next day with fresh eyes, essentially, so that you're looking at the big picture again.
[00:15:49.230] So very similar to what you're saying.
[00:15:52.330] Yeah.
[00:15:52.790] The funny thing, too, is like doing the sniff test is sometimes very high level.
[00:15:58.670] You're just like, oh, yeah, this number seems to make sense to answer this question.
[00:16:01.770] But other times you're actually going in and looking at other KPI to see if this projection makes sense relative to each KPI.
[00:16:12.150] So then when you do that, you're also walking through questions that other people might have.
[00:16:18.470] So then you're preemptively coming up with answers to those questions, too.
[00:16:23.030] Like, yeah, I know this relative to this other metric might seem a little strange, but it actually makes sense because X, Y and Z.
[00:16:29.370] Like you're doing all that prep work, too.
[00:16:31.430] So sniff test in general, I feel like is very, very useful.
[00:16:35.010] Do you ever sniff test with fellow employees?
[00:16:39.370] Actually, yes.
[00:16:40.830] I've done this with reports as well as with projections.
[00:16:44.710] So like, oh, I ran this number.
[00:16:46.390] Can you guys take a look and see if it makes sense?
[00:16:48.990] The other thing could be like, OK, I spent like five days working on this report.
[00:16:54.630] Can you like double check all the formulas and whatnot?
[00:16:58.010] Sniff testing with other people is highly recommended as well.
[00:17:03.550] Nice.
[00:17:04.510] I guess speaking of other people, I think another tip that I learned is it's OK to ask other people for help.
[00:17:11.810] And I think this one's a little bit cliche.
[00:17:14.630] You know, it's applicable to like work and real life and everything.
[00:17:18.070] But I think it is a lesson that I'm constantly reminded of, especially when you have a good team surrounding you, people that you feel comfortable with, that you're confident in their work, that kind of stuff.
[00:17:32.110] It is really helpful to ask someone to even just like sit down and brainstorm with you or put a second pair of eyes on the work that you've done.
[00:17:41.810] Or sometimes even to just really help out like, hey, can you do this portion of the project?
[00:17:47.290] And I'll do like this portion of the project that I'm stronger at and that portion that you're stronger at.
[00:17:52.490] I'm going to be honest.
[00:17:53.510] I'm still not like the best at this, but I definitely try to keep it in mind.
[00:17:58.310] And I think in each job that I'm in, as I build a stronger rapport with my teammates, it starts to feel easier to approach them for like maybe smaller favors at first and then like more bigger collaborative efforts.
[00:18:13.350] Dude, I feel like this one, I mean, you mentioned that it might be a cliche, but I actually feel like this is a skill.
[00:18:19.390] I say that specifically because it's often kind of shared as like, oh, you know, this is advice, like do this tip or whatever.
[00:18:26.830] But I think you actually have to like work and develop how to ask people for help because you kind of have to carve out like specific points that you need help on, which in itself can be kind of difficult sometimes.
[00:18:40.790] And then you are mapping it to people who you think could help you best, finding the right timing to do it, seeing how you want to lay out the info or project or whatever to be able to ask for help.
[00:18:52.470] So this is something that I need a lot of work on as well.
[00:18:56.150] And I think the more you do it and the more you practice it, it gets slightly easier.
[00:19:01.130] That's true, because depending on your career path, you could be like a individual contributor for a while if you don't want to become a manager or maybe the nature of your job is more like individual contributor-esque.
[00:19:15.590] So if you're not in a manager position, it's almost weird to like try and delegate.
[00:19:22.030] Right.
[00:19:22.870] And I feel like in my perspective, it almost forces you to like write out a project plan and be more of a project manager in that moment.
[00:19:33.830] And that might be a little different from the way you normally operate.
[00:19:37.830] For example, I don't really write myself project plans.
[00:19:40.590] It's just kind of like a general checklist versus some other people, if you're asking for their help, might want to see the bigger picture laid out as well as the more minute details that they're helping with so that it all makes sense for them and that they know they're not wasting their time.
[00:19:56.430] Mm-hmm.
[00:19:57.610] And you also have to practice the way to ask someone for help in a way that makes them want to help you.
[00:20:03.730] Oh, so true.
[00:20:04.570] I think by default, most people are willing and happy to help you, but people don't always have enough bandwidth or they might see your request and be like, oh, this is a lot.
[00:20:14.010] So you kind of have to ask it at like the right timing in the perfect way with everything packaged neatly.
[00:20:20.750] Absolutely.
[00:20:21.190] So this actually leads me to a different tip that I learned from a boss who I learned a lot of things from a very short period of time because this person had a lot of particular ways to kind of do their work in a way that is most effective, essentially.
[00:20:37.010] And this tip that I picked up was the CEO tip.
[00:20:41.130] The essence of the tip is you want your work to be ready to be read by like a CEO.
[00:20:46.770] And as it is frequently known, CEOs don't have much time.
[00:20:50.350] So that basically means your work needs to be very clear, easy to read.
[00:20:54.670] And also the report itself needs to be easy to navigate.
[00:20:58.250] So if you're working on like BI software where the data is already kind of easy to read and navigate, this might not apply to you as much.
[00:21:07.210] But if you're like a very Excel heavy numbers person, Excel needs to be like manually kind of formatted so that it's pretty and easy to read.
[00:21:16.450] And one of the things that this boss taught me was to always put your mouse cursor on cell A1.
[00:21:25.330] So the topmost and leftmost cell for each sheet, go back to the tab you want the report to open it and then save in that way.
[00:21:34.370] And it sounds very particular and kind of strange, but it makes a ton of sense because when someone goes and opens an Excel sheet, it will automatically open at the tab that it was saved on.
[00:21:47.890] When you click through different tabs, if you left your cell cursor on like the bottom most cell or like all the way on the right or something like that and saved it that way, it'll always open that tab in that same way.
[00:22:01.630] So by putting your cursor in cell A1 on everything, you're basically like reorienting the spreadsheet to look exactly how you were intending it to look.
[00:22:12.190] It just saves a couple seconds of people's time but makes a world of a difference in terms of professionalism, how it looks, how it can be read, etc.
[00:22:22.190] So when I first heard this, I was like, damn, that's a little strange.
[00:22:26.630] But the more I started doing it, I was like, well, this actually doesn't take me that much time and it's very easy to do and saves other people time.
[00:22:35.330] So I still try to do this to this day, especially when I send out like reports and stuff.
[00:22:40.030] Honestly, that's a really good tip because sometimes I open random Google Sheets and it's just open on like some random tab.
[00:22:50.090] I'm like, oh my God, where's the info I'm looking for?
[00:22:53.090] And then I have to like scroll through all the tabs and like figure out what's going on.
[00:22:57.090] But yeah, if it were to just land exactly on the tab that I wanted, it would be so much more helpful because you're right.
[00:23:05.330] It does save a lot of time.
[00:23:06.510] And sometimes it's not even just a couple seconds.
[00:23:09.330] Maybe it's like a whole minute or two where they're figuring out the data sheet as a whole.
[00:23:13.970] And then they can be like, oh, OK, like this is where I need to be.
[00:23:18.690] This is where it connects.
[00:23:20.090] I've also seen some people get really creative and they have like maybe the first tab just set as instructions, like how to use this data sheet.
[00:23:30.190] Go to like this tab to do this and like that connects to this tab.
[00:23:33.570] Of course, that's like much more complicated and might take a lot of time.
[00:23:38.070] But I do think it's also kind of good practice just to like exercise documentation.
[00:23:44.370] And I don't know about you, but I feel like that's a huge word in like work.
[00:23:49.510] It's always like don't forget to like document what you've been doing and like templatize it for the future.
[00:23:55.050] Like all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:57.810] Yeah, I feel like it's kind of funny that you say that because with every boss that I've had, the way their templates work and like the way their spreadsheets are structured are very different.
[00:24:08.590] And then I feel like when you work under a boss, you start to just like morph into that kind of person.
[00:24:14.130] So I really like the way my crit boss templatizes her work and being under this boss for a little bit.
[00:24:21.210] It's like second nature to me now, but it is interesting kind of looking back at the spreadsheets of my various former bosses and see how it differs.
[00:24:29.970] The evolution of your templates.
[00:24:32.310] Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:34.190] I thought of another tip that I've learned, but it's not necessarily related to what we've talked about.
[00:24:39.990] I think maybe you can relate where somewhere inside me there is a perfectionist and that perfectionist wants to do everything to 110%.
[00:24:52.770] Everything must be perfect.
[00:24:55.410] The ideal is you turn in this project and everyone's just like, wow, perfect.
[00:25:00.510] No notes.
[00:25:01.530] On to the next.
[00:25:02.670] Right.
[00:25:02.850] And I think that can often lead to like procrastination too, because you're stuck thinking, what do I need to do to make this perfect?
[00:25:11.670] So there was this one time my manager at the time told me just straight up, she was like, Crystal, I think your 80% is already plenty.
[00:25:24.210] It is more than enough for everyone else.
[00:25:27.150] And I was like, oh, that might be true.
[00:25:30.950] Because there's a reason why you're in your job, right?
[00:25:33.970] And it's because that you're an expert at it.
[00:25:36.550] And that means the people around you are not always experts at it.
[00:25:39.970] So if you just like trust in your expertise and bring forth good work, that's usually enough.
[00:25:46.650] And then it saves you a lot of time from like nitpicking at yourself into making these like probably good, but like extremely minor and like niche adjustments that maybe no one else would even notice.
[00:25:59.370] Like I'm moving like these things pixels over and I'm like, oh, yes, it is perfect now.
[00:26:04.470] But literally everyone else is like, there's no difference.
[00:26:08.610] It looks good to me.
[00:26:12.490] So I think it was a really good tip and reminder that sometimes it really is worth it to save that extra 20% of effort for another project or for handling feedback or whatever.
[00:26:27.070] And maybe, you know, in that moment, the more important part is to get the project out.
[00:26:31.950] Dude, this is such a good tip.
[00:26:34.050] And it's something that I grapple with as well.
[00:26:37.170] We obviously work in like slightly different fields of work, but I feel like any time you put out a project, at least for me, I am like, damn, what's the kind of feedback that I'm going to get back?
[00:26:47.970] I feel like I'm always trying to think about that and then make tweaks to my numbers or my methodology or whatever to get to the perfect number so that no one could ask any questions about it.
[00:27:00.290] But it's like that obviously doesn't exist.
[00:27:02.270] And the important part is not to not get any questions about it, but to be able to like clearly explain the work and the reasoning.
[00:27:09.650] If tweaks need to be made, you just make tweaks.
[00:27:12.690] But I feel like I'm so scared of that like potential feedback sometimes that I like spend so much time honing over my work, which ends up just being unproductive in the long run.
[00:27:23.150] Could have just pushed it out, gotten feedback, tweaked it, and then we would have been done like two days ago.
[00:27:27.430] Yeah, so true, so true.
[00:27:29.750] I still grapple with this for sure as well.
[00:27:32.670] It's hard sometimes to let go of that perfectionism, especially when you don't even realize it's like you're just being a perfectionist.
[00:27:40.190] Right.
[00:27:40.650] And I think it was like pretty eye-opening when my manager just told me straight up and I was like, oh my God, you're so right.
[00:27:47.210] I'm spending hours here like changing these tiny pixels when I'm totally forgetting that the big picture already looks fine.
[00:27:55.230] I feel like I would hear this feedback and be like, so you're telling me my B- is an A-plus to you.
[00:28:03.490] But I think all of this goes to show that so much of what we do in a career standpoint is like relative to other people, which is something that I learned from one of my bosses as well.
[00:28:16.430] I feel like this point was hammered into me, but this is the lesson of know your audience.
[00:28:21.830] As broad as this tip could be, I think in my field of work, it has very specific meaning, which means that anytime you are communicating to cross-functional partners, every cross-functional partner has a different goal that they're trying to hit, a different metric that they're measured by, different interests that all come together into this big like corporate pie.
[00:28:43.850] Even though I might just have one set of numbers to share to people, I am trying to convince these people that my number makes sense based on what metrics that they are looking for, essentially.
[00:28:57.290] So simple terms, for example, I might be saying, guys, we need to set this product to cost $5.
[00:29:02.310] But there might be one team saying $5 isn't going to get us enough profit.
[00:29:06.870] We need to up the price.
[00:29:08.230] But the sales team might be like, oh, $5 is way too expensive.
[00:29:11.810] No consumer is going to buy that.
[00:29:13.630] So being able to convince different audiences that my number is legit and a way that makes sense to them and their goals, I think is something that I'm always working on.
[00:29:25.850] Dude, this is why they made us write persuasive essays in school.
[00:29:29.910] So true, actually.
[00:29:31.830] Oh, my God.
[00:29:33.210] And I think this goes to like other factions, too.
[00:29:37.070] If you are a very technical person, but you're talking to people who are not technical or not doing these things on a daily basis, being able to kind of word things in a way that they would understand without all this like extensive back knowledge that you have.
[00:29:53.450] Or same thing when you're speaking to like executives.
[00:29:56.890] I am seeing like the daily nitty gritty on all of these things.
[00:30:00.710] But the executives are not just reading my emails.
[00:30:03.170] They're also reading other people's emails.
[00:30:05.150] They have a billion things going on through their brain.
[00:30:07.770] So they might not remember things that to me, I'm like, I call this out like eight weeks in a row.
[00:30:12.290] So being able to kind of like cut through that noise in their brain and like jog their memory a little bit of like, oh, yeah.
[00:30:19.170] Remember how I've been calling out this thing for two months?
[00:30:22.290] It's the same issue now.
[00:30:24.870] But wording it in like a polite way, I guess, is also part of the skill.
[00:30:29.930] Right, right.
[00:30:30.770] Yeah, I can totally see how this applies to any work with cross-functional teams.
[00:30:36.530] I can even see how it could apply to like my position.
[00:30:39.690] Like you said, not everyone's going to know the nitty gritty of your job.
[00:30:44.310] So sometimes people might ask me like, hey, I want like all this fancy stuff in this graphic or like video.
[00:30:50.950] Is that possible?
[00:30:52.150] And I'm just like, okay, low key, no.
[00:30:54.290] It's like not possible.
[00:30:57.030] And they don't know that.
[00:30:58.410] So you have to like explain it to them and give them the rundown.
[00:31:02.330] They're not going to sit there and like listen to you, give them a 30 minute lesson about like,
[00:31:06.890] so these are all the things that I've been doing.
[00:31:08.590] And this is why it's not possible.
[00:31:10.310] You just kind of have to like give them it really basically like, oh, it's like not so possible because of this or like whatever.
[00:31:16.530] Yeah.
[00:31:16.910] And it kind of reminds me of this like corp speak thing that I feel like a lot of executives tend to say,
[00:31:22.730] which is like, oh, I don't know what I don't know, you know?
[00:31:25.710] And it's like, I am not the biggest fan of this phrase.
[00:31:29.990] Like I feel like I'm always just like thinking of that drama.
[00:31:32.390] It's okay not to be okay.
[00:31:34.830] But I think it is very true.
[00:31:36.950] And sometimes when you're doing your own work in a silo, you're like, oh, how come no one else knows this shit?
[00:31:44.030] Like this is so obvious.
[00:31:44.910] But then you realize that all the other teams are working on their own things in a silo too.
[00:31:50.610] So this is why kind of communication is key.
[00:31:53.590] For sure.
[00:31:54.610] And speaking of communication, I have also kind of learned low key at work.
[00:31:59.510] You just have to treat everyone like they're toddlers, not in a demeaning way or a diminishing way.
[00:32:06.170] But it's similar to what we've just been talking about.
[00:32:09.010] Like not everyone's going to know the nitty gritty of your job.
[00:32:12.530] They're not going to know all the technical aspects.
[00:32:15.290] You pick a random person off the street.
[00:32:17.670] They're not going to know all the ins and outs of like Excel or Photoshop or whatever.
[00:32:22.490] Sometimes you just have to remember that you can't be too technical.
[00:32:26.590] And maybe you should try to explain things, you know, that like subreddit.
[00:32:31.470] Explain it like I'm five.
[00:32:33.530] Ooh, yes.
[00:32:34.350] So kind of in that similar vein, try to be able to explain things really simply so that anyone could understand it.
[00:32:41.970] That also entails being clear and concise, which you also mentioned earlier too.
[00:32:46.770] Dude, I feel like this is totally something that you pick up on during meetings or all hands or like presentations.
[00:32:54.590] You can always tell people who can do this skill and people who can't.
[00:33:00.310] And I feel like the people who can explain things very clearly but promptly are the ones who like really deliver their message and like get their point across.
[00:33:09.910] And the people who kind of like waffle about, you're kind of left wondering like, okay, what was the point of what you were saying?
[00:33:17.810] Like you only have so much brain capacity.
[00:33:20.470] Yeah.
[00:33:20.710] And sometimes meetings move fast.
[00:33:22.190] So it's always nice when people are very concise and clear.
[00:33:26.210] And I think the people who are really good at cutting through the noise and like being able to communicate these things are always the people who interject.
[00:33:34.010] And they're like, okay, I think what you're saying is that the takeaway is, well, they like summarize whatever the person just said.
[00:33:41.830] I think they're just like, let me just save everyone's time.
[00:33:45.610] Clarify.
[00:33:47.190] I mean, there's definitely been moments where I send out an email and then I'm like, after it's sent, I'm like, oh my God, this is the most convoluted email I've ever typed out.
[00:33:55.770] So I like immediately follow up.
[00:33:58.430] Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:59.150] Just to clarify like one sentence.
[00:34:02.130] Yes, I know.
[00:34:03.110] I think this is my problem too.
[00:34:04.750] I'm not a very concise person.
[00:34:06.170] I like to present all the info, detail everything.
[00:34:10.070] And I'm especially bad about this in emails.
[00:34:13.090] What I started doing is if you have like an internal AI tool that you can use, I started putting my shit into like the AI tool and be like, okay, can you make this more concise or can you simplify this or whatever?
[00:34:24.190] And then it really helps me kind of like weed out the things that I need and don't need.
[00:34:29.070] Yes, that's very smart.
[00:34:30.430] I've definitely been testing that out a little more here and there as well.
[00:34:34.550] It also works when you just can't think of anything to write.
[00:34:37.630] And you're like, can you help me like come up with a paragraph about this?
[00:34:42.890] I feel like the more I use our internal AI thing, the more I'm like, damn, in like 10 years, I'm just going to forget how to start an email from scratch.
[00:34:51.570] Oh my God.
[00:34:52.010] You know what I mean?
[00:34:55.370] But that means we'll be able to use our brains for more complicated tasks.
[00:35:00.190] So true.
[00:35:01.310] But I kind of fear that we've been glazing our former bosses and like the tips we've picked up from them for the last like 20 or whatever minutes.
[00:35:12.330] So I do want to ask, is there anything that you've picked up from your former bosses that might be a negative or neutral habit?
[00:35:22.010] Yes. And I think luckily I haven't really picked it up into my own routine.
[00:35:27.770] But I do sometimes notice that people can have not as good work-life balance.
[00:35:33.810] And I definitely take note of that.
[00:35:36.170] And I just, it's a reminder to myself.
[00:35:38.110] For now, I'm very capable of being able to finish my things within the workday.
[00:35:44.110] So make sure I don't force myself to have to work outside of my normal hours.
[00:35:50.610] Just because to me, I think work-life balance is very important.
[00:35:54.650] And sometimes it works for other people to like work at a little bit of an off hour or whatever.
[00:36:00.030] But I think ultimately it would not be good for my happiness.
[00:36:07.190] Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:36:08.770] I feel like this kind of stuff really seeps into your personal lifestyle too.
[00:36:13.570] And it's not always just like direct stuff.
[00:36:15.750] It doesn't have to be your boss piling on a ton of work or forcing you to work past five.
[00:36:21.090] But I think it can come in the form of like comments made in passing.
[00:36:25.770] My friend told me a story about how her boss was like,
[00:36:29.730] Oh, so strange working for a company where people actually leave the office before 7 p.m.
[00:36:35.930] And I remember when she told me the story.
[00:36:37.670] I was just like, dude, what the fuck?
[00:36:39.110] If my boss told me that, I would forever be stressing like,
[00:36:41.850] Oh, does this person expect me to stay past 7 p.m.?
[00:36:44.970] Yeah. Oh my god.
[00:36:46.610] Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:36:47.930] It's like very encouraging.
[00:36:50.850] Yeah, it's just like too much, I think.
[00:36:52.630] Very, very luckily my org and the people I work with generally don't force that onto other people.
[00:36:59.730] Even if they themselves might work past their regular work hours occasionally,
[00:37:05.410] we try not to like force that onto each other.
[00:37:08.230] It's healthy in the sense where it's like,
[00:37:10.450] if I'm working past my normal hours, it's probably my own fault.
[00:37:15.730] So it's like kind of keeping yourself accountable.
[00:37:18.050] Very luckily, we don't have a culture where we expect people to like be on in the middle of the night or any of that sort of thing.
[00:37:26.030] Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:37:27.410] I think I've had either bosses or cross-functional partners that did sort of prefer that lifestyle of being always on.
[00:37:36.730] And it's a huge stress.
[00:37:37.770] You might be done with work and you log off, but you see urgent Slack messages or like texts or phone calls come in and you're like,
[00:37:44.490] oh, okay, time to reboot my laptop.
[00:37:47.230] I know we've said no more glazing, but one useful tip that I learned was someone likes to put in their email signature,
[00:37:55.930] I log off at, I don't know, like 6 p.m. PST.
[00:38:01.450] So please don't expect me to answer until the following day if you email me past that time.
[00:38:07.310] You know, something more concise than that.
[00:38:09.470] But I thought that was a really helpful tip, especially if you work with people who are maybe international.
[00:38:16.970] Sometimes they forget you're on a different time zone.
[00:38:19.590] So it's a friendly reminder or nudge that can be helpful here and there.
[00:38:25.270] Can you imagine if we all just set our Slack emoji to the ghost emoji after 5 p.m.?
[00:38:33.000] Like, you can Slack me, but I'm going to ghost you until tomorrow.
[00:38:36.280] So funny.
[00:38:38.000] I actually just always set my status as away or invisible so people don't know if I'm actually online or not.
[00:38:46.540] That's wild, dude.
[00:38:47.780] I think it sets the precedent that like, oh, I don't know if she'll respond or not.
[00:38:54.600] Oh my god.
[00:38:55.720] I just have, you know, the Slack.
[00:38:57.060] Slack, you can set it to not give you notifications past a certain time or something.
[00:39:01.440] I feel like whenever you see that like ZZZ at a certain hour, you know, like, okay, this person is probably not on.
[00:39:07.120] So I just have that on auto every day.
[00:39:10.620] Oh, that's smart.
[00:39:11.800] But Slack is actually something that I feel like your boss's preferences also seep into your work habits.
[00:39:18.000] So I've had a boss who is very like email is the way to go.
[00:39:22.380] And then Slack is like for very urgent needs or whatnot.
[00:39:25.540] So then I was very into like emailing for a while.
[00:39:28.280] And then I feel like with other bosses, they're way more on Slack and then email is only for like specific, more formal forms of communication or maybe reporting or cross-functional communication.
[00:39:38.700] So then getting used to that was definitely a little bit more interesting.
[00:39:42.220] It's like I became an email expert and then I had to become like a Slack person.
[00:39:48.660] And I think it doesn't sound that big of a change if you're only emailing a couple people at a time and then only slacking a couple people at a time.
[00:39:56.940] But I'm talking about going from emailing a hundred people and then slacking a hundred people.
[00:40:03.940] You know, I feel like it's like very scary and kind of like a completely new world.
[00:40:09.140] Yeah.
[00:40:09.700] Not to make it sound like a huge deal or anything, but it kind of is.
[00:40:13.420] That's a lot.
[00:40:14.180] But I think in my work chat, the biggest group that I actively talk in for work related stuff is eight.
[00:40:23.760] Usually it's all just one on one chats.
[00:40:26.600] That was like what I was used to, too.
[00:40:29.100] Occasionally there would be a specific project group chat or whatever, but it was never that big.
[00:40:33.940] And I feel like even each group chat has its different culture.
[00:40:38.020] Like some group chats are very, you know, you put a lot of emojis and like GIFs into it and whatnot.
[00:40:43.220] And other group chats are very like formal, you know.
[00:40:46.740] True.
[00:40:47.940] So all of this stuff in Slack, you kind of have to like move and adapt to.
[00:40:52.340] Yeah.
[00:40:52.820] You're like, is it appropriate if I react to this with a silly GIF?
[00:40:59.260] I'm like, how crazy can I go?
[00:41:02.880] And then I love how like sometimes in some spaces a certain emoji or GIF is used so much and you're like, okay, this is like the go to safe option.
[00:41:11.920] Oh my God.
[00:41:12.420] Yes.
[00:41:13.200] Yes.
[00:41:14.160] So true.
[00:41:14.920] True.
[00:41:15.220] But I do think in terms of learning negative or neutral things from bosses, kind of what I mentioned at the beginning of the episode when I had a not as great boss, it really helped me pinpoint like what are some things that are not too great that I should be on the lookout for.
[00:41:33.760] So yeah, lack of feedback, lack of communication, maybe the general sense of a company's structure too, looking at that and recognizing if it's a structure that you'll be able to thrive in or if it's one that maybe you don't fit into as well.
[00:41:49.220] Yeah, that's such a good point.
[00:41:51.260] I feel like the structure thing is interesting too because oftentimes when you're a junior level employee, the structure doesn't really feel as visible or like impactful to you because you're kind of a cog.
[00:42:02.900] But the more you go up your chain of command, they are the people who are contributing to the structure and helping to form it.
[00:42:10.780] So I think if you look up and you don't feel as much faith or trust in what is happening or like their powers or capabilities, it could be a sign to leave too.
[00:42:22.160] So I think that's a good point.
[00:42:23.900] So I have a final question for us.
[00:42:26.860] Do you think the first boss you ever have is more impactful than any future boss?
[00:42:34.200] Low key, yes.
[00:42:35.780] At least for me, I think this rings very true.
[00:42:38.700] I did work with my first boss for a very long time and he was like a fantastic boss.
[00:42:44.600] So I feel like for me, I can confidently say yes.
[00:42:47.580] But I also wonder if it's kind of like your first real boss, you know, like if you don't consider someone a real boss, they might not be your first.
[00:42:56.500] My answer to this is yes, to a certain extent.
[00:43:00.220] Because in the beginning, we're so ignorant.
[00:43:03.840] We don't really know what's going on in the work world.
[00:43:07.180] So I think the first boss leaves a big impression.
[00:43:11.520] Whether they're there to build you up and help teach you and show you the ropes of what a good boss looks like.
[00:43:18.560] It's a pretty deep impression.
[00:43:20.820] I'm just imagining like what if I was really unlucky and had a terrible boss to begin with?
[00:43:27.120] I think that would kind of dampen my mood.
[00:43:29.960] Maybe it would make me look in the future with a more negative or like Debbie Downer kind of attitude.
[00:43:36.420] This is just how work is.
[00:43:37.760] You just have to suffer through it or something.
[00:43:40.540] But if you if the stage is set with more positive vibes like, oh, wow, I'm learning so much.
[00:43:46.440] This boss taught me like the career ladder and like gave me tips.
[00:43:50.960] And like now I know I feel prepared as I go into these next stages of work life.
[00:43:56.840] I think that definitely can be very effective.
[00:44:01.000] Yeah, I think you're right in that your first boss definitely sets the tone for how you even view bosses or like work in general.
[00:44:09.880] But I wonder if it's kind of like the concept of a first love where it's like, you know, you see a multitude of different people.
[00:44:18.020] And then you're kind of like, yeah, this person's cool, whatever.
[00:44:21.620] But then it's not real until you find someone who you're like, yeah, you are my first love and you like give them the crown.
[00:44:30.980] So that's what I mean of like you choose your first boss.
[00:44:34.780] You know what I mean?
[00:44:36.460] OK, that just sounds like you're choosing the first boss that was good.
[00:44:42.780] OK, fair, fair.
[00:44:45.540] But, you know, not every boss is worthy of being called your first boss.
[00:44:50.880] Right.
[00:44:51.640] OK, I guess.
[00:44:53.120] I suppose like this one was just a fling.
[00:44:59.820] Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:01.800] That one's not real because they were just my boss for X amount of months.
[00:45:08.320] You have the power to legitimize your first boss.
[00:45:13.480] I guess that's fair.
[00:45:14.820] You chose your first boss to be someone from post-college.
[00:45:18.500] But I consider one of my first bosses during college.
[00:45:23.000] How empowering is this message, guys?
[00:45:25.700] The power within.
[00:45:27.340] You choose your own fate.
[00:45:30.800] But I do think similar to a first love as time goes on, it fades because you eventually find, you know, your partner for life.
[00:45:42.220] Wait a minute.
[00:45:46.620] Now I'm getting all confused.
[00:45:50.060] I guess what I'm trying to say is that in the beginning, the first boss leaves a big impact.
[00:45:55.480] But maybe as you get older and like gain more experience and start to feel more confident and comfortable in yourself, that first boss's impact starts to fade a bit because you've like ascended it, if that makes sense.
[00:46:09.440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:10.680] That totally makes sense.
[00:46:11.980] But now I'm thinking like, who is going to be my final boss?
[00:46:15.260] Like the boss that I marry?
[00:46:17.160] It's you.
[00:46:18.580] Oh my God.
[00:46:20.780] Wow.
[00:46:21.260] Wow.
[00:46:21.980] This episode has taken a crazy turn.
[00:46:27.520] Well, I think that's quite a hopeful way to end the episode, actually.
[00:46:32.000] But it definitely has been interesting to sit down and talk through some of the tips that we've retained from our former bosses.
[00:46:39.340] It's interesting to see that a lot of our tips that you and I have collected are quite similar.
[00:46:43.820] So I'm interested to see if any of our listeners have any tips that they've retained from their former bosses.
