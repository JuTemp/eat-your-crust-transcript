[00:00:00.240] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. So before we jump into our topic today, I have a funny story. And to me personally, it's kind of a sad story actually. Oh. So let me start by- But it'll be funny to me?
[00:00:27.550] Maybe. Actually, this is the fucking curse again where I'm like, this is a funny story. And then later I'm like, is anyone gonna laugh? But basically, for context for anyone who doesn't know me in real life,
[00:00:39.150] I have really long hair. So I've been kind of growing it out too for the wedding. So right now it reaches my belly button-ish, which is pretty nice for when I want to curl it
[00:00:50.670] and like look nice and stuff. But in the day to day lifestyle, it's actually really annoying because I get like sweaty around my neck area if I'm in a really warm environment, or it gets like tangled in my piercing sometimes or like,
[00:01:06.030] you know, it's just kind of like in the way all the time. So I usually have it up in a claw clip. And I would actually say that if you hang out with me
[00:01:14.830] in real life, you probably see me more with it up in a clip than it down. That's true. I haven't seen you with your hair down in a while. Dude, right? I don't know what is wrong with me. So this is the fucking problem
[00:01:27.390] that caused my sad slash funny story. So I was on a video call with my co-worker, and she lives a little bit further from the office. And she's also part time. So I've never actually met her in real life, even though we've worked together for like three,
[00:01:41.390] four years, maybe. Oh, wow. And she's awesome. Like, she's super cool. And we always get all of our work stuff done and then have some minimal small talk before and after the meeting.
[00:01:51.550] She was like, Oh, you know, I saw you the other day in this like huge work call. And for that big work call, I went into work. So the camera, you know, the ones hanging on a TV
[00:02:02.590] on the wall in like office meeting room. Yeah, it showed like the full body instead of just the webcam. That day, I actually curled my hair. So I was like, I'm not going to put it up in a clip.
[00:02:14.030] I'll just leave it down. And it's kind of cold anyway. So I was like, it wouldn't get all annoying and everything. And she was like, I never knew you had long hair. I always thought you had
[00:02:21.310] short hair because of our video calls. And at first I was just like, Oh, that's so funny. And then later I was thinking about it. And I was like, in a webcam, if my hair is up in a clip,
[00:02:31.950] it literally makes me look like I'm bald. Like, I actually was so like, it was like deeply upsetting to me. Because really, like you can't see anything except maybe just like the top bangs, but even like
[00:02:46.030] my bangs are growing out. So they're just like all clipped back. So it almost looks like I have like a buzz cut or like a really short cut or something out. And I was just like, Oh my god,
[00:02:56.350] like this is causing me extreme distress. Wait, take your headphones off for a second. Let me take a good look at this. Oh, you know what I mean? Like right now it's down.
[00:03:08.430] But when it's in a clip, I literally realized I look like I'm fucking bald. So I was I was really upset. And in a joking way, like I obviously wasn't sad or anything. But now I'm just thinking,
[00:03:21.790] should I throw out all my claw clips? Because it's such a force of habit. Like, once I'm used to it, I just always use it. So yeah. Dang, okay, I can kind of see it after you took your headphones off. Dude, right?
[00:03:36.910] Hard to tell because I feel like it's a 5050. You know, like, Oh, either this person has their hair up or they have a short pixie cut or something. Right. And also, I realized what also probably made it worse was at work, I always have a
[00:03:51.550] virtual background on. And because it's kind of green screeny, it kind of blurs out all the edges. So I was like, she probably thought I was bald this entire time.
[00:04:04.850] Oh my god. Okay, maybe what you need is to clip your hair but like have it poop up in the back. Yeah. Wait, that's low key genius or like a high pony where it's like, literally at the top of my skull.
[00:04:21.570] Like, hey guys, I have hair. It's right here. Oh my god. That is pretty funny though. That was my very distressing story. What about like if you didn't have a virtual background? I think that would help. But I mean, you're gonna see now but my virtual background has
[00:04:45.390] a mirrored closet sort of showing. Yeah, then every time I don't have a virtual background on, even like accidentally sometimes people are always like, Oh, like I see James in the back. Because, you know, that's perfectly where James's desk is actually.
[00:05:00.270] Yeah, that's true. That's pretty tough if it's like pretty necessary to have a background. I don't think you have to throw away your claw clips, but you might have to come up with a creative way to have your hair poking out somehow.
[00:05:15.390] Yeah, or just claw clips are cancelled. Everyone tell your friends. I also have a kind of funny story that is also related to work. So you know how like, we all go into the office a little more often nowadays. I usually go into the office around
[00:05:36.750] three times a week. And I'm seeing more and more people in the office. And I'm getting to know people who sit near me as well. So earlier this week, I was in a meeting with this dude,
[00:05:49.710] and we're talking about like some slides, some design stuff that I was going to help him with. All good, super nice guy. And then later in the same day, I'm like walking along in the halls,
[00:06:01.950] and I see him. And he says hey to me. And I'm trying to say hey back, but dude, but instead of like a hey coming out, it's like a squeak. Oh my god. Can you recreate it? Okay, yeah, let me try. It was something like, hey.
[00:06:24.670] Wait, no, it was higher than that. Here, let me try again. It was like, hey. At that volume, like quiet. Yeah, it was super quiet. It was actually higher than that, like much more squeaky. And like,
[00:06:39.390] you can't even tell if it's actually a word. I could see the confusion entering his face. And then he heard the noise, but he wasn't sure if it was like a hey back or like an accidental
[00:06:52.830] squeak or like a throat clearing or something. But then I was like so embarrassed. I was like, dude, if I talk again, it might be another squeak. So we just had like awkward eye contact
[00:07:08.450] for two seconds or so. And I was like, I'm just gonna scurry back to my desk. Wait, I have so many questions. Like, did you smile at him? Yes, I tried to save it with a smile. But it was probably an awkward smile because,
[00:07:24.290] you know, like inside my head, I'm like cringing at how I squeaked. Right. Oh my god. Actually, that is low key one of my biggest fears. Where you know, when you don't talk for a long time, your throat is just not warmed up. Yes.
[00:07:40.850] So then I feel like you have to kind of clear your throat a little bit before you talk to prevent things like that. So then I just have this horrible habit of always clearing my throat
[00:07:49.650] constantly. And I'm just like, dude, I can't clear my throat more than I talk at work. Oh my god. Honestly, I think I'm similar. I like try to clear my throat. If there's even like
[00:08:00.530] anything I'm like, dude, it might be a squeak. It was just that this dude came and I was unprepared. So I you know, I didn't have time to clear my throat. He was already rounding the corner saying hey, and I was like,
[00:08:16.910] oh man. But I kind of made up for it because later, it was either the same day or maybe it was the next day. I saw him again in the hallway and this time I was prepared. I gave a like a nice,
[00:08:30.590] well voiced out, hey. And he was like, hey, like a full bodied Hey. There were no squeaks the second time he heard me loud and clear. It was not an awkward eye contact anymore. It was like solid eye contact with smiles and nods all around.
[00:08:52.030] Okay, it's like a usually I'm normal and here's proof kind of a hey. Exactly, exactly. That's the dilemma low key. Like when things like that happen, I'm like, should I acknowledge that
[00:09:03.870] that was weird and be like, oh, I don't know what sound that was haha but hey, or should I just make the moment as short as possible and move along? Oh my god, that's a good question. Maybe next time I'll try acknowledging it. I'll be like,
[00:09:17.070] oh, I'm sorry, my voice is broken. Anyway, enough stewing in my awkward moment. I think we can move on to the topic at hand today. So I kind of wanted to talk about what makes a close friend. And I
[00:09:38.930] guess like before we can truly dive into the topic, we have to consider what exactly is a close friend. In my mind, I think a close friend is someone who you trust a lot and you'll share with them
[00:09:53.090] secrets, I guess or you know, just things that you wouldn't share normally with anyone on the street. I think that's a good definition. I think I honestly found it a little bit easier to define
[00:10:05.410] what a close friend was when I was younger. Because I feel like when you're young, close friends are sort of like people you just hang out with more and prefer more than other people like at school.
[00:10:18.210] Right. But now that I'm older, and time is a little bit more of a limited resource, I feel like I can't really hold the term close friends by that definition anymore. Where it's not always
[00:10:30.770] like the people that I can afford to see the most. But it's something different. Like it's kind of hard to define now. That's true. I feel like also because it's very common, at least I think in the
[00:10:45.250] Bay maybe to hang out in like large groups sometimes, or like friend groups, like maybe four to five people, something of that sort. And when that happens, things get shared. And you know,
[00:10:58.850] maybe a specific person might not be close to you, but they'll know because they were part of the group hangout. And by association, they know more about you. Yeah, I guess if I really had to try to
[00:11:13.170] define how I see my close friends, I think it would be people who I kind of can't imagine not having in my life for the rest of my life. Like people that I value really dearly and I can
[00:11:28.530] envision us at like 80 years old being grandmas or like grandpas together in like a retirement home or something. Yeah, that's a nice image. I know it's kind of abstract. But then like
[00:11:45.890] what makes them reach the point? Is it the frequency that you hang out with them? Or is it like a certain level of trust that you built up? Because I feel like there's also sometimes
[00:11:58.850] friends who you don't see as often, but they're still like a super trusted and like close friend. Yeah, that's a good point. I guess in my mind, if I was creating like a close friends litmus test,
[00:12:13.410] maybe the easiest thing would be can me and this person hang out one-on-one and run errands all day? Maybe that's kind of the litmus test because I think if someone has really good vibes in general,
[00:12:27.570] even if you're not close friends, you could probably do like a big friend group hangout together or just hang out with them and things like that. But when it comes down to like the
[00:12:37.010] mundane stuff, can you and this person hang out all day and not get bored of each other? And maybe bored isn't really the right word, but can this person fit into your life like a puzzle piece when you guys are in the same area or something like that?
[00:12:51.890] I like that because you're so right. Like some friends, they're just like peripheral almost, like not in a bad way, but they're just like not close to you. But like by association and stuff,
[00:13:02.370] they're there and like you've gained some sort of closeness, but maybe not to the point where it's like they're your inner circle. Right. And I think there is something to be said about what you mentioned earlier about can I share my deepest, darkest secrets with this person?
[00:13:18.770] This might sound a little bit weird, but I feel like there's even tiers or categories to secrets. So there are things that you wouldn't post about on like Instagram, for example,
[00:13:29.170] but it could be like a juicy story that's like, you know, here, let me tell you a secret, but I actually don't care if word gets out. It's just more like a personal thing, but not necessarily
[00:13:38.130] I have to guard this with my life. So those kinds of secrets, I could see myself sharing at like a friend group hangout where maybe some of my close friends are there, but other people I'm not
[00:13:47.810] as personally close with. But then there are those secrets that are like, I can count on one hand the number of people I've told this to, you know what I mean? Like something that's like actually deeply
[00:13:58.530] embarrassing. And if this were to get out, I would be like KMS basically. I do agree. Like, can I trust this person enough to tell this secret or like maybe say these things that
[00:14:10.290] I wouldn't feel comfortable saying in front of like other people that I'm not as close to. So there is kind of like a trust and like emotional balance requirement for close friends too. True. Oh my God, do you have almost like a test? Like if you feel like,
[00:14:26.930] oh, I vibe really well with this person, maybe I'll share a secret and like see how it feels. It's like the first gate of friendship. Damn, I can't think of one specifically,
[00:14:42.530] but I feel like I probably do have like some sort of checkpoint, you know? Like I think maybe for me, it's like, can we hang out one-on-one and I feel super comfortable around you? If we're hanging
[00:14:52.530] out and I'm laying down, then I'm probably really comfortable around you. But if I'm like sitting up straight and I'm not comfy, then maybe we're not that close. Like you're guards up. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:15:03.330] I see. I see. Yeah. I'm just thinking, I think I also don't have like a specific secret necessarily, but there's definitely been moments and I've found this to be easier in situations where like
[00:15:16.450] one recent one that I can think of is like it was me and maybe like one or two other girls in like a bigger group of guys. And so me and the girl were like vibing more just cause like,
[00:15:30.210] you know, we're like the only girls in this huge group of guys throughout the night. I feel like we're vibing well. And so I like slip in a little secret. I'm like, Ooh, don't tell anyone about
[00:15:39.890] this. But like I got some tea for you. I think I understand. Secrets are kind of a cheat code to furthering a friendship too into like a close friendship. Yeah. It actually kind of reminds me
[00:15:53.810] of our college friend group from freshman year. Do you remember that one night we were up really late passing around like a bottle and then we shared like our deepest darkest secrets. And then
[00:16:05.170] we stayed up till like five or 6am that night, I think. And I think that was one of the nights we were like, okay, we're like close friends now. Dude, yes. But the craziest part is I don't even
[00:16:14.850] remember any of the deepest darkest secrets. Like I don't remember what I shared. I don't think I remember what anyone shared. I remember like bits and pieces. I think most of it was just kind of
[00:16:24.130] like our childhood traumas or something. But I think you know, it's probably that idea of intimacy that is kind of established when you do share deeper secrets. And maybe it's not as much of
[00:16:39.890] like a test but kind of like a passageway right? Fun friends, people that you like hanging out with maybe stay at that level if you don't share some things that you hold pretty close to your heart.
[00:16:54.210] If fun friends can stay as fun friends, do you think close friends can fall back and become less close friends? Oh, that's a really interesting question because I would almost say that sometimes close friends aren't fun friends. Oh, so they're not fun to be around?
[00:17:19.810] Okay, that is not what I mean. But maybe it's hard to revert back into the levity of fun friendships when you are at that close friends level. Once you have shared like your darker secrets or maybe
[00:17:33.490] are used to sharing very personal like small details of your life, then it is hard to revert back. And I think there is a certain pattern that comes with being a close friend to someone.
[00:17:46.450] Sometimes I think you pigeonhole that friendship into just close friendship where you only divulge like details and secrets and like tea and you forget to do fun stuff with each other. And that's something that's like a learning that I've been having in the last few years, especially
[00:18:03.330] post-COVID where I'm like, am I just doing the same thing over and over with these people that I value so deeply but I'm just so used to having this type of hangout with them, you know? Oh,
[00:18:13.810] I see. I see. It's like I think I saw this TikTok that I actually sent to you as well where the narrator of the TikTok was like, oh, a lot of our adult friendships nowadays are like
[00:18:26.610] we just hang out and storytell to each other and we aren't doing active activities as much. So it's like we're bonding over not shared experiences in a sense, which I think kind of
[00:18:40.210] matches what you're saying. A lot of these close friends, we just end up sharing, you know, our stories with them like, oh my god, you'll never guess what happened. And then it's their turn.
[00:18:47.970] They're like, dude, like guess what happened to me too? And then we like have these meaningful catch-up sessions, but like we're not creating new experiences as much kind of like you said.
[00:19:01.970] Yeah, I really was struck by that TikTok you sent me and I think one of the symptoms that happens when you aren't exploring new experiences or creating new shared worlds for yourselves basically
[00:19:17.490] is, you know, I think a lot of hangouts you meet up and especially if it's like a long-term friendship, you kind of reminisce about the times where you did create new experiences with each
[00:19:26.610] other all the time and you're like, oh, remember when this happened or remember when that happened? But you can only do that so many times before it's kind of like you're just talking about the same
[00:19:35.490] thing over and over. And part of me was kind of like, oh, that really sucks that this is a loop. I guess I just never thought about the alternative or like the solve for it until I saw that TikTok
[00:19:47.810] because there is a way out from like the infinite loop that you're like stuck in sort of. I guess I just never thought about it that way of why don't you just go out and do things together
[00:19:56.610] and like create new memories? Okay, but I will say that I think we're not too bad about like creating new memories. I feel like we've done it decently a handful of times when I think of
[00:20:09.650] us specifically. We've gone on a few trips together with like a little small friend group. We've hung out in New York and stuff, but I feel like those are kind of big events. Like,
[00:20:22.210] you know, traveling to a whole new country, flying over all the way to the East Coast. They're like kind of more big events versus regularly occurring things. So I guess that's like where we can still
[00:20:34.610] improve. Yeah, I think that's definitely true. And I feel like once you do it and you and your friend or maybe you and your friend group are like used to this habit of, okay, this year we
[00:20:44.850] have to have a trip or this year we're going to go do all these different things, then it becomes part of your routine actually. So then it's not so like, oh, we have to go out of our way to do
[00:20:55.410] this. It's like, yes, of course we're doing this because we always do this. I think the harder like portion of this maybe is when you and your friend are close not in a friend group or maybe
[00:21:07.810] like as you grow up, your shared hobbies and your shared interests and your priorities have kind of split off, then I feel like it's a little bit harder. But the term hard too is just like,
[00:21:20.450] it's really not that hard. It's just like you just push to do it and then you just do it. But in my brain, I've categorized it as hard for some reason. Yeah, I mean, okay, if you think about it
[00:21:30.530] too though, I'm going to compare this to romantic relationships. So what I've kind of noticed is in the beginning of a romantic relationship when people are still being wooed, the dates are
[00:21:44.370] different because the dates are kind of like, oh, what are things we can do? And sometimes you get cheesy things to do, but it's still helpful to bring the relationship forward because it's
[00:21:59.170] stuff that you're doing. So an example is bowling. That's such a date thing. It totally is. People don't really bowl as friend groups super often, but I feel like it would be totally very
[00:22:11.730] fun if people did. But I saw this funny meme that was like, bowling alleys are still alive because of first dates. Oh my God, that's so funny. That's actually so true though. I can't
[00:22:24.210] remember the last time I bowled. When you think about that, like beginning of the relationship, it's like activities. But then later as the relationship becomes more comfortable, more settled, then it becomes less of activities and it's more like, oh, let's grab dinner. Let's
[00:22:41.890] get dessert. Let's stay in and watch TV. And there's nothing wrong with that, but it kind of reflects friendships in a way too. True. And I feel like even just changing the location or
[00:22:56.370] something is also new enough to where it could be exciting. For example, if you and your friend group always goes to someone's house to sip wine and chat, maybe this time you go out to a wine bar
[00:23:09.970] or if you guys like to go to someone's house and watch a movie, maybe you go out to the movie theater or a drive-in movie. The activity you could kind of hold, but maybe switch up the
[00:23:19.410] environment a little bit. And that way you're introducing something new without having to completely change the dynamic of what you and your friends are used to or enjoy doing. I guess the only problem then is, I don't know, maybe it's a Bay Area thing or a suburbs thing,
[00:23:34.130] but I feel like a lot of these things that we do, like, oh, go to someone's house and drink there instead of going out to the bar, is either because of comfort because you're at someone's house and
[00:23:43.650] there's comfortable couches and stuff, or sometimes it's because of money. And it just makes more sense to not pay $20 for a cocktail when you can spend some cheaper alcohol at someone's house.
[00:23:57.250] But yeah, I don't know. At this age of 27, I don't want to stop experiencing new things just because I'm like, oh, this is the easy thing or this is what we always do or this is cheaper. Agreed. Your solutions are really good ideas because sometimes you're like,
[00:24:13.410] oh, it's also a lot of work to think of something that everyone will want to do. Not everyone wants to do it, but you're right, changing up the scenery or just
[00:24:24.130] doing the same activity but in a different font almost. True. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. It's all very helpful ways to have more experiences with friends. And I think, kind of tying back to the original topic, these experiences help bring friendships
[00:24:48.050] to become closer. Because I'm kind of also just thinking in my mind, the fact that, for an example, me, you, James and our friend, Aubie, we have gone on two international trips together now. And we just have a certain connection because of that that not all of
[00:25:08.610] our close friends have with us. Right. And in some ways, I feel like it kind of expands how much your friendship can take or you're not testing it, but you're training it like a muscle. Because
[00:25:24.290] having good vibes with someone in a two-hour hangout, easy. You just have fun together and it's like you're on for two hours and then you go home. But for a two-week trip, for example,
[00:25:35.330] it's not as easy. But you learn so much and you almost develop an equilibrium of, okay, this is how we hang out and have fun even when we're tired or even when we're stressed,
[00:25:47.010] or this is how we decompress together, etc. So I think you almost have to train the friendship to withstand more tension maybe. And you're also polishing it at the same time like a trophy.
[00:26:00.290] Dude, so true. And I mean, I guess in some situations, it could make or break a friendship. That's true. Maybe you guys go traveling and then you're like, damn, actually, maybe we don't vibe.
[00:26:18.770] Or maybe it just kind of makes a friendship step down in a way where you're like, oh, like this person I don't vibe as well with during long travels. So I just won't do that with them.
[00:26:30.770] Yeah, yeah, definitely. And I think there's probably like a benefit to that too. It's like you just understand this friendship's boundaries or like, you know when this friendship is the most optimal and things like that. So we kind of talked about how experiences help bring friendships
[00:26:49.570] closer. But we also mentioned how nowadays a lot of our friendships are actually missing those experiences that can elevate a friendship to the next level. So kind of thinking about that, do you think it's harder to find slash make close friends nowadays, like at our age?
[00:27:09.410] I think this is actually a really interesting question. And I wonder if now we just know what we want or seek in friends. So then we are slightly pickier with what we want from friends.
[00:27:24.530] Or maybe it's just that a lot of our life or like our needs are maybe fulfilled already. So then you no longer are like seeking for a void in your life or something. I don't know.
[00:27:36.770] But I do kind of think it is harder to make good friends at this age. But I don't think it's impossible. And I think a lot of my really close friends now are people that I've known very long
[00:27:49.170] term. But some of them are people that I've met more recently. And I think, you know, even if maybe the duration that I've known these people is shorter, like they're still of course meaningful
[00:27:59.490] and like very important people in my life. So I don't think it's impossible for sure. But it is just harder. I think you make a really good point about maybe we're not in search of
[00:28:10.450] something to fill a void because it's kind of like, through these years that we've grown up, friend slots have been taken, you know, like filled. And so now that we're here, it's more possible that you have like more friend slots filled than not filled.
[00:28:29.570] Having gone through like school, college, maybe even like grad school and like early career. So I think that makes total sense. It's just like a lot of the things that you're seeking have already been fulfilled slash are being fulfilled. And I guess to kind of tie it back
[00:28:48.290] to an earlier episode we had, having a significant other I think also plays a part in this where we're kind of getting to the age where a lot of people have started to settle into more serious
[00:29:02.450] relationships if they are in relationships. So then because of it being like pretty serious and long term usually, you know, their significant other is like basically their closest friend of all. So that takes up like a big space as well. And I guess like,
[00:29:20.450] I'm just thinking in my mind too, realistically, it's kind of hard to have a ton of close friends. It's a lot of people to keep up with. And it's a lot of like time and energy as well.
[00:29:31.010] Yeah, I think it definitely is a really hard balancing act because it's not just friends that you're kind of maintaining in your life. Like now you have work and you also might have
[00:29:42.050] kids later and you have your living situation and your family and like all these different factors have to be fit into a very specific schedule. So then I feel like a lot of our 20s, at least for me
[00:29:56.050] has been like, how do I make the schedule work so that I don't feel super busy, but I'm also not just like stagnant and not doing anything at home. After you finish honing that schedule, if you
[00:30:08.450] meet someone new, then fitting them into like your already like jam-packed schedule, I feel like is another challenge. So then maybe that's another thing too, it's like timing, you know, like the
[00:30:20.370] timing of meeting someone cool or like valuable in your life. Like it's, I think a big factor too. Yeah, there's only 24 hours in a day. And like a lot of that is just sleep and work actually and like eating.
[00:30:36.450] Yeah, and like nowadays at this age, usually the most common way that people meet each other is at work now. You know, it's up to you, like if you want to turn a work friend into a close friend,
[00:30:47.410] sometimes it's harder than you think, sometimes it's easier than you think. So there's a lot of varied experiences there versus I think in school, it's a little easier than work because like age range is more similar, you usually have some sort of common interest, like I don't know,
[00:31:07.650] your major or something. And like at work, it's just there's like more varied factors. Definitely. And also like people quit their jobs and you're just like, oh, I no longer see you every
[00:31:19.970] day. I think I mentioned it in an earlier episode, but that used to like strike me to the core where I was like, how could you leave this company? But now I'm like, okay, it's not personal anymore.
[00:31:31.570] Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking about it right now. And I actually don't think I've made like a really close friend recently. Sorry, that sounds like so fucked up. But I mean, like, there hasn't been
[00:31:46.610] someone where I met where our friendship just like elevated so quickly to the point that they're on par with like my previously really close friends. But what has happened is post college, there have
[00:31:59.730] been some friends who maybe like during college, we weren't at a really high level, but we were at a pretty decent level. And then since graduating and being adults now, they've elevated slowly over
[00:32:12.770] the years. Well, yeah, I feel like I had a really similar experience as well. And I feel like those are always really cool to kind of experience because to me, it kind of feels like you planted
[00:32:25.090] something in your backyard, like a long time ago, never looked at it. And then you look back and you're like, this like a huge tree now. And it's kind of cool, because it has the benefits of a new
[00:32:36.050] friendship. But it also has the benefits of a legacy friendship, because you just know each other for so long. So those kinds of friendships, I feel like are the sleeper ones. And maybe that's actually the cool part about these interpersonal relationships, where maybe when you first meet
[00:32:52.530] your lifestyles weren't compatible, or just that timing wasn't the right one for you guys. But who knows, maybe down the line, your lives could open up to each other. And then you could become close
[00:33:03.810] friends. I think it is also possible that like, you know how we're talking about right now, we don't have quote unquote new close friends, but maybe like five years down the road, someone who
[00:33:15.490] we consider pretty normal friend right now becomes a close friend, because it just like it takes the time for that to happen. And for their friendship to like level up and reach that. Right, definitely.
[00:33:31.250] So I have a question for you. And this is kind of related, I guess, to the balancing act of close friends. I think it's fairly common for people to have multiple close friends and not just one.
[00:33:45.330] Something that I used to struggle with when I was younger, was trying to kind of see if I was playing favorites with these close friends. It kind of sounds stupid. But what I mean is like,
[00:33:58.130] I would say, okay, all these people are my close friends. So then if I tell my secret to this one friend, am I saying that all these other friends aren't my close friends, because I didn't tell
[00:34:09.330] them the secret. So then I would feel this obligation to keep up and like tell every single close friend every single secret. And then eventually I was kind of like this is not
[00:34:17.810] sustainable. And I think it also doesn't make sense where I would have like a meeting agenda going into a hangout with a close friend. But you know, do you feel or have you ever felt these kinds
[00:34:29.490] of pressures where maybe you're comparing your friendship with one close friend to the friendship with a different close friend? Okay, I'm gonna make a callback all the way to episode one.
[00:34:45.890] So we had our friend Tiffany on for that episode. And there was a part in that episode where we were talking about friends and our different friendships. And one particular thing that we talked
[00:34:57.090] about was that sometimes friends just fit in different areas of your life. I'm kind of thinking of that like immediately when you mentioned the different close friends. Like, you know, one close friend is really good for ranting about work with and the other close friend is
[00:35:17.970] really good for, I don't know, like talking about food or, you know, kind of like that. So I think in one way a lot of these close friends kind of fit like that. It's like this one we vibe doing
[00:35:31.410] these things, that one we vibe doing those things. But yeah, I think there is maybe sometimes a little bit where you're like, oh, this is a close friend of mine. Like, I should probably share this with
[00:35:42.050] them too. But I think like maybe it doesn't feel too much like that. At least for me. I don't think I've gotten to anything like that. I don't think I think about that too much. And if the moment
[00:35:58.450] arises, if an opportunity arises where I'm like, oh yeah, like I can share with them this like particular information, I'll usually just hop on it. Yeah, that's probably like the healthier way of looking at it honestly. And I'm someone who struggles a little bit with insecurity and I
[00:36:21.010] think that makes me overthink situations a little bit. But I think one of the situations that I fear a little bit, or this has happened to me too on the flip side, but sometimes I just feel
[00:36:35.010] that if I don't tell one close friend a secret, or maybe not so much a secret, but let's say like a life update for example, right? If I have only told three of my close friends this one life update
[00:36:48.050] and then the other three close friends I haven't gotten a chance to tell yet, or maybe we just haven't hung out in a while or something like that. But then my close friends kind of
[00:36:57.170] intermingle and hang out. I would hate for one of my close friends to hear news about me or maybe even a secret about me if they're also close friends. Like I would hate for them to hear that
[00:37:08.850] through the other person. And I think sometimes this kind of overthinking or balancing makes me feel really weird and feel a sense of obligation and responsibility where maybe I shouldn't. Because like you said, sometimes you just don't get to it or maybe you just haven't
[00:37:25.970] crossed paths with your close friend in a while. But because I've been on the side where someone has said, oh, you didn't hear this person blah, blah, blah. And I was like, oh shit,
[00:37:35.170] I thought we were close friends, but maybe not is like the second part of that one. It should really just be like, oh, but we haven't caught up in a while. But the brain instantly goes to maybe
[00:37:44.530] not. So I think I just have fear about trying to prevent these situations. Okay, honestly, that's totally fair. Because when you bring that up, I'm like, oh shit, no, that's right. I've definitely felt that too before. You're like, oh shit, I guess I haven't
[00:38:02.370] seen this person in a while. I need to catch up with them because I didn't hear about this. I think also, you in particular have a lot of close friends who know each other because you've
[00:38:15.250] mingled friend groups a decent amount. There's kind of that aspect to it as well. I think I'm kind of lucky enough where I have a bit of a centralized close friend group, which is like
[00:38:27.890] my high school friends and I can just share an announcement or a life update in there. So it reduces some of that. Oh, didn't you hear about this? If they didn't hear, it's their own fault because they didn't read the group message kind of.
[00:38:44.370] And I think my friend groups don't overlap a ton. So I by design don't need to worry about it as much. But you by design are a little more prone to having that worry, I think. Which is totally understandable. Yeah, that's a good point. And actually,
[00:39:06.770] now that I think about it, if I was more on social media, maybe this would solve the issue. If I had a job update or a life update and I just announced it on Instagram or something,
[00:39:17.970] a lot of people do, then maybe it would be less so like, okay, I have to tell these people so that they don't run into this situation or whatever. And that's not to say that I'm good
[00:39:27.810] at this kind of upkeep. I think because I fear it and I get anxiety about it, I like, don't commit to the solution. And I just continue to fear it, which is horrible. But
[00:39:41.170] it's probably is like somewhat of a specific situation. Yeah. But I do also feel like there have been times where I'm like, I guess slowly updating the different friends slash friend groups of a certain life update. And I'm just like telling the same story over like
[00:40:00.130] five or six times. And I'm like, dude, I have this story like memorize like I can write a book. Oh my god, I know exactly what you mean. You're like at this point, it's so developed. There's like a beginning, a middle and an end.
[00:40:18.050] Like this is when everyone should laugh and I'll like pause so that you can laugh. Exactly. So I think that can also be pretty repetitive for sure. So one question as we continue to talk about, I guess these insecurities and friendships.
[00:40:33.010] Have you ever been in a situation where you met someone and you were like, oh my god, I feel like this could be a potential close friend, but you felt insecure about, I guess moving it on to the next level?
[00:40:48.050] I think yes. I can't think of anything like too specific off the top of my head right now. But for sure, I think that is a very common thing. And then I think there is like the common
[00:41:02.290] occurrence after that is like you come up with excuses in your head. You're like, oh, maybe I should hit this person up. You're like, no, but like, they live far like they're an SF and
[00:41:12.770] I'm like in South Bay. So it doesn't make sense to hang out or like, oh no, they're probably busy. They have so many other friends. Like why would they want to hang out with me? That kind of stuff.
[00:41:24.130] Okay. I have a stupid example. So at work there's this person that I like really vibed with at a work event and we like had dinner a bunch of the evenings and like chatted and we just like really
[00:41:40.290] bonded and like vibed. But then the work event ended and we all returned to our normal lives. And in my mind, I was like, I don't know what to say to her. How do I continue this friendship?
[00:41:52.130] You know? So we just like didn't talk for a while until we like saw each other again at work, which was like many months later. But then like when you see each other, it's like good vibes all around
[00:42:03.570] still. I think like there's no fault for not hitting each other up because it's still like a very fresh friendship. But it's just like in that moment when you see each other and you're like
[00:42:14.210] still vibing while you're like, oh damn, like why was I worried at all? But then later once again we return to our normal lives and like the thoughts come back. Dude, this is like a romantic movie or something. I feel like I've definitely seen a movie with this
[00:42:29.170] kind of plot. Yeah, this is actually me just trying to make one friend at work. It's so complicated, right? But I know exactly what you mean. And I think you hit the nail on the head when you say
[00:42:43.490] your brain just starts to make all these excuses on why you shouldn't hit this person up or maybe why it wouldn't work out not to make it relationship-y again. But I've had such similar
[00:42:54.450] things where my brain jumps and then I'm just like, oh this person is so cool, so cool. And then the moment kind of slips away. And I think one of the fears too is like yes, this one time we
[00:43:06.770] hung out or maybe in this one specific environment we always vibe. But what happens when I take us out of that specific environment and do something more personal or maybe intermingle you with my
[00:43:18.610] other friends or like all these different factors where I'm like, is it just better if we keep this friendship like this? And then that in turn just cages it again, right? So yeah. I think it's also
[00:43:31.330] scary because it's like, oh god, if we just hang out what if it goes wrong? Like what do I do? What do we talk about? So many worries. Exactly. Like what if I'm awkward? The awkward thing specifically
[00:43:47.090] too has gotten worse for me post-COVID where I'm just like, I don't know how to interact with people anymore. And even when I do interact with people and it goes okay, I'm like in some ways I'm so used
[00:44:01.250] to just being at home now. That's like my real life and then the outside world is like me going on a business trip, you know? Wait that's such a good way of putting it. You're like, all right we're
[00:44:12.210] going out into the world, gotta put my game face on, put on real clothes. Dude. Exactly. I literally in the beginning of the episode I mentioned how we go into the office sometimes now and I was
[00:44:27.170] like looking through my closet, I was like what do I wear? I just have a bunch of loungewear from COVID. Like all the expensive stuff in your closet now is like pajamas. I was like oh my god, where did my work clothes go?
[00:44:44.690] Oh my god yeah. And don't even get me started about putting on work professional or like heels or you know nice boots and stuff. I was like these are just cages for my feet.
[00:44:55.410] How did I used to wear them every day to work? Yeah and sometimes I'm like is this even appropriate? Like I feel so different in them, like who am I? But yeah I definitely feel that. I guess the
[00:45:07.730] pandemic technically ended a year ago-ish but it still feels like we're ramping up from it in some ways. I guess like the thought is the pandemic's over so like tomorrow we'll be back to our quote-unquote normal selves pre-pandemic but that is like completely wrong. Like the
[00:45:28.610] pandemic was at least two years right? So that's like habits formed, changes cemented I guess. So it will take time for us to like revert back and I think we forget that sometimes.
[00:45:42.210] Like even I forgot about it until actually I was talking with my therapist about it and she was like dude that's something we forget that there's ramp up time. That's why you're so awkward in the
[00:45:52.290] office, me crying on the couch. Yeah that's true and I think definitely social skills for sure like you said but also the lifestyle habits as you mentioned. I was talking to my boss and he was
[00:46:05.010] like oh yeah I used to always go to this place after work with my coworkers and we would hang out here. Nowadays I feel like after work I just want to beeline at home and maybe it's the generational
[00:46:18.530] difference but I also feel like because of COVID people want to go home you know? Like they default to going home and being home and I'm not as used to having like post-workday weeknight plans anymore
[00:46:31.410] but I do feel like pre-pandemic that was totally a thing. Yeah you're so right nowadays I'm like damn if I'm not home by 5 p.m like it's a bad day but like back in the day pre-pandemic
[00:46:46.450] sometimes I'd get home at like 7 or 8 and I was like this is normal. Yeah and I feel this now too where it's like you know when you're trying to make plans with someone and you look at your calendars
[00:46:57.410] and you guys both are only free on like a weeknight I feel like it's like oh I'm sorry like maybe only Wednesday works does that work for you? It's like almost an apologetic tone whereas before it's like
[00:47:07.730] well yeah let's do dinner and drinks on Wednesday but now I just can't even imagine it being that casual. Oh that's true that's such a good point like oh after work let's just go grab dinner and
[00:47:19.090] it's like yeah totally now it's like uh I'm trying to go home. Like on a school night? No thank you. Exactly. I guess like after all of our discussing and reflecting I think close friends are definitely
[00:47:35.730] really valuable and sometimes it takes some patience to like turn a friend into a close friend so as we kind of mentioned maybe if a friend's not a close friend right now it could take a few years as we un-awkward ourselves like ramp back up from the pandemic
[00:47:54.930] regain our social skills and all of that and I think we talked a lot about just the experiences and like how we hang out with friends so I guess moral of the story is as long as we treat our
[00:48:06.850] friendships well and like do enjoyable things with them then like that's already really good. We don't have to force labels necessarily on people just spending good time and energy on good people is the best course of action we don't have to think about it too hard.
