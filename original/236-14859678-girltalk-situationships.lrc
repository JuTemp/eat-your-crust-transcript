[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Jane. And I'm Cindy.
[00:00:17.840]  All right we have an interesting Gen Z word today. The word is kind of originating from gaming
[00:00:26.560]  actually but I have noticed recently that it's being used more in like TikTok or just outside of
[00:00:33.440]  gaming slash Twitch community. But I've also noticed that like maybe a lot of young kids are on Twitch
[00:00:40.240]  and or like watching streams lately because I think a lot of these newer slang words are coming from
[00:00:47.760]  streams and just like the interesting meme culture of Twitch. So the word that we're
[00:00:54.640]  going to discuss today is bot. Like robot, bot. Like B-O-T. Yes, B-O-T. This word is used to describe
[00:01:05.040]  someone as dumb basically. It's almost like calling someone an MPC because in a lot of games
[00:01:14.000]  they kind of put you through simple tutorial game where you play against literal AI bots. So this
[00:01:20.480]  is kind of where the word originates from because these AI bots are not meant to be very good. So
[00:01:27.440]  sometimes people just call each other bots. Oh you're so bad, you're playing like a bot wood.
[00:01:33.840]  I remember when I was first learning to play League in high school there were definitely those
[00:01:38.480]  AI bots that are built into the game but I think there's also people who bought their normal
[00:01:44.640]  accounts or something like that. So then sometimes you would see someone play and then
[00:01:49.600]  their character would literally just run into the enemy Nexus and just like immediately die
[00:01:53.840]  and then all the comments would be like okay this guy's a bot or something. So then this word
[00:01:58.240]  reminds me of those days where you would just see people do like completely nonsensical things in
[00:02:02.320]  games. Low key sometimes I feel like you see that shit in real life too. Sometimes people
[00:02:07.040]  are just bots and you're like why are you acting like this? Okay but this makes me think
[00:02:11.920]  of the smart bots like I feel like there's a scale. In chess there's like chess bots
[00:02:15.840]  right that people can't beat. So are you like a dumb bot or a smart bot? Intermediate or advanced bot?
[00:02:24.880]  It's like are you NPC or bot? I think that's really classified. So NPC is worse. No I think
[00:02:31.200]  bots are probably worse. Sometimes how I think of it is like a bot doesn't have a real brain
[00:02:37.040]  so that's kind of the insult behind it like oh you don't have a human brain. Because at
[00:02:42.000]  least NPCs they have like the phrases right where they say like oh do you want an apple?
[00:02:47.680]  That's true like NPCs at least have personalities. Exactly but bots don't.
[00:02:54.560]  Yeah I think this is a very versatile word actually. I can see a lot of applications
[00:02:59.280]  of this in real life and it's interesting to me because there's also a Gen Z slang word that
[00:03:04.800]  I've been seeing on TikTok which is bop and I think that one's also negative and that one
[00:03:09.520]  is probably it means a little bit more like this person is promiscuous or like this person has
[00:03:16.160]  sexual intentions or something like that but the words are so similar. So every time I read it
[00:03:20.400]  I'm like okay is this bop or bot and then I have to like sort it in my brain. We're like BOP? Yeah BOP.
[00:03:26.640]  Wait doesn't that mean a sick ass song in R? Yeah right that's a bop. That's exactly what came
[00:03:34.000]  Your millennial is showing. Nooo. Damn they've free to find our words.
[00:03:43.760]  Now it means something bad that's crazy. How can it even mean that? I actually have no idea
[00:03:49.600]  but I see it and it always makes me frown a little bit because I didn't like when people were
[00:03:55.520]  called certain words when we were growing up and now I feel like the Gen Z kids are going
[00:03:59.920]  through their own iteration of it so I would much prefer bot than bop although both are.
[00:04:07.120]  Dude if some Gen Z person called me a bop I would be like wow thanks that sounds like such a good
[00:04:12.880]  word. Like you're a bop. Yeah it's like a compliment. You'll be like thanks.
[00:04:19.040]  Amazing. I am a sick ass bop. I am a bop. Oh my god you know what I also found out
[00:04:25.120]  last night that kids are saying so one of the words that we had on the podcast last year was
[00:04:31.520]  eight like if you did something really well then like you ate so sometimes kids say what's four
[00:04:37.280]  plus four. I've seen that on Instagram comments. That's because like four plus four. So that means
[00:04:44.400]  like sick or no. It kind of means like you did so well like you ate it kind of. Yeah. Oh my
[00:04:52.880]  god I thought so. Does that mean it's sick? Does that mean it's hella dope? No. It's four plus four.
[00:05:03.840]  Dude they do stuff like if it's like just below eight it's like that's seven.
[00:05:10.560]  You're almost eight. You're almost seven. She was so close. Oh my god but it was really
[00:05:21.600]  funny because when I first saw that four plus four I was like eight out of ten like and then I was like
[00:05:28.240]  oh eight I see. I feel like those moments are so humbling when I see something and I have to like
[00:05:34.160]  google it I'm like oh my god I'm so old. Hey but at least we can keep up just barely but we're
[00:05:40.720]  keeping up. That's true now we know what bop means and bop. Well through our Gen Z slang
[00:05:48.960]  section you may already find that these voices sound familiar to you. So both Jane and Cindy
[00:05:54.880]  have been on the podcast before and Jane has joined us on episode 168 where she talks about her
[00:06:00.320]  masters in arts education and how that funneled her into the world of consulting. And Cindy joined
[00:06:06.240]  us back in episode 194 where we dove deep into group chat dynamics. We're actually super excited
[00:06:13.040]  for this topic today because one it was a topic that our listener asked us to cover. And two I feel
[00:06:21.040]  like it's just one of those topics where there's so much ambiguity in the term so I'm excited to
[00:06:25.920]  have both Jane and Cindy on today to talk about situations. Very excited because I love girl talk.
[00:06:34.080]  Yeah it's been a while since we've done our last girl talk so very excited to get into this
[00:06:39.280]  one. So let's kick this off by diving into the meaning behind the term. So what is a situation
[00:06:45.920]  ship to you and how is it different from the terms dating or a fling or an FWB? I thought about this
[00:06:54.400]  and I think it's hard to have like a clear definition but the way I think about it if you
[00:06:59.520]  had more than three dates with someone but it's not official so the situation shifts
[00:07:07.120]  because just if you the first two dates because then you're like you don't really care about this
[00:07:12.880]  but then as it goes to like three because I never had just three days it's always like
[00:07:18.320]  one or two or like three plus so I think at that point it becomes a situation ship.
[00:07:25.200]  I think yeah I agree it's kind of like a no commitment romantic relationship so
[00:07:31.680]  you're basically dating but there's no labels there's not really any next steps because I feel
[00:07:37.520]  like maybe the conversation haven't gone there yet and you're basically kind of like in a limbo
[00:07:43.440]  I guess not a relationship but not dating either. So maybe it's like the step before you become
[00:07:50.000]  exclusive? Yes depends depends if you get there. Do you think you can be in an exclusive
[00:07:57.680]  situation ship? I think so but it really depends on if you guys are on the same page about stuff.
[00:08:04.080]  Yeah my first thought was yes and then I thought about it again I was like I don't know.
[00:08:09.440]  That's how much of a limbo it is like in a situation ship you don't know.
[00:08:13.520]  Yeah I think because in my mind I've pictured situations shifts as just the more confused you
[00:08:20.160]  are the more likely you're probably in a situation ship there's just not a lot of things
[00:08:25.280]  being defined. I actually agree with that because my personal theory behind this word is
[00:08:32.080]  I feel like there's a certain connotation to the word situation ship because I do believe that you
[00:08:37.040]  can go on multiple dates with people or a specific person and you guys could just be like casually
[00:08:43.040]  dating but I feel like with specifically the term situation ship it almost feels like one long
[00:08:50.080]  term thing maybe slightly more long term and two somewhere where you purposely don't define it.
[00:08:55.840]  So it's not like oh we haven't defined it yet it's more like we're not defining it for a specific
[00:09:00.160]  reason so do you guys think this kind of tracks with what you're thinking or do you feel like
[00:09:04.640]  it's less negative for you? Well it's definitely not defined it's like the pre what are we
[00:09:10.240]  conversation because no one says like what are we oh we're a situation ship. Fair.
[00:09:15.440]  True. At that point you have to decide so it's the pre but it could be kind of like what you were
[00:09:20.720]  saying maybe people are purposely avoiding that conversation or it's like that conversation hasn't
[00:09:25.840]  happened yet. But I've also heard like people who are in six or seven months situation ships
[00:09:31.760]  and I feel like at that point it's like you guys should talk about it. Maybe they're just
[00:09:37.520]  both non-confrontational. True I think I have a friend they were like in a year long thing
[00:09:43.920]  I was like no. Wait are you dating or no you're not oh that's a real situation ship for sure.
[00:09:51.920]  You know what maybe a situation ship is just a fling that has gone on for too long.
[00:09:57.600]  Like an expired fling. Yeah yeah I could see that because one of the terms that I floated
[00:10:04.160]  in the like definition was FWB and I feel like FWB is a little bit more defined it's just
[00:10:09.680]  the benefits basically but I feel like a situation ship is similar as a fling where you're like seeing
[00:10:15.680]  each other consistently but it's still up in the air on what exactly you are. You know what I think
[00:10:22.640]  I have a theory that you can change FWB into a situation ship but only on your side if you
[00:10:30.480]  catch feelings. Oh yeah not a mutual. It could be mutual but it's like a situation ship for you
[00:10:39.680]  because you don't know what to do next. Oh I see I see yeah that could happen. Maybe situation ship is
[00:10:46.560]  more one person versus like two person if that makes sense like it's a situation ship for you
[00:10:54.400]  because you don't know where you stand because you haven't talked to the other person or maybe
[00:11:00.960]  like it's a situation ship for the other person because they don't know where they stand
[00:11:04.720]  because like you two haven't talked. Wait there wouldn't it still be situation ship for both? I guess
[00:11:10.400]  like yes technically but I think if you are on the end where you're like oh no like to me this is
[00:11:17.440]  just say like friends with benefits or something but then the other person is like you know they've
[00:11:22.560]  caught feelings they're like oh my god what do I do this is a situation now kind of
[00:11:28.320]  I think there are times where people will be like oh I like you but I'm not ready
[00:11:33.200]  for us to be in a relationship so then it becomes a situation ship where you're like oh okay I guess
[00:11:38.960]  we'll just stay it's like I like what we have now you know yeah it's like one of those situations
[00:11:44.960]  and then that's why I take a situation ship. True I've had friends that were really devastated
[00:11:50.320]  after like a situation ship breakup sometimes even more so than the relationship breakup.
[00:11:55.840]  I wonder why that is because I guess logically you would think oh relationships usually tend
[00:12:00.880]  to be longer it's more official maybe you mesh more into each other's lives etc etc but I have also
[00:12:06.560]  heard similar things like that where the situation ship ending can be a little bit more brutal or
[00:12:12.400]  I guess specifically it can be harder to recover from so what is it about a situation ship
[00:12:18.000]  that's maybe sometimes harder to let go or like get over? I would assume it's like even if it's
[00:12:24.560]  short it could be really intense so that could be a reason why it's harder because it can be
[00:12:30.080]  like a short but very intense type of relationship maybe because it's so intense it doesn't really
[00:12:35.520]  work out as a relationship either. I think maybe it's also the untapped potential because you never
[00:12:42.480]  reached a relationship. Yeah you kind of get caught on that what if oh what if it could have worked
[00:12:48.160]  stuff like that but then with a real relationship you already go through everything so by the end
[00:12:53.040]  of it you're like oh of course it's not working out because we try to end it and work out
[00:12:57.120]  versus the situation ship there's a we didn't really try it so now I'm going back and forth
[00:13:02.640]  wondering oh should I have tried or not and then it becomes more I guess devastating as what people
[00:13:08.000]  would say. Yeah like the unknowing aspect. And I think to Jane's point it's probably a little
[00:13:14.320]  toxic too because you don't you know like you're constantly confused maybe anxiety written
[00:13:21.440]  thinking about what's gonna happen or like what to do next so then the highs are highs and
[00:13:26.640]  the lows are low. Yeah I think I keep going back to what Cindy described earlier where she said that
[00:13:32.240]  situationships can sometimes feel like you're in limbo because relationships have clearly defined
[00:13:37.600]  expectations it's like you're expected to talk through these things with your SO and you're
[00:13:42.080]  expected to work on things together and have healthy communication but realistically in a
[00:13:47.520]  situation ship you're not really expected to do any of those things even if it feels like
[00:13:52.560]  you should so then I feel like maybe if you're constantly wavering back and forth or if the other
[00:13:57.520]  person isn't fulfilling certain needs that you would expect from someone who's say an SO I feel
[00:14:02.720]  like that would leave me with way more questions than like answers when something ends. Yeah that's
[00:14:08.880]  probably why honestly their most situationships are probably toxic and unhealthy. Yeah the limbo
[00:14:16.960]  the non-communication. Dude the non-communication okay I have a theory you know kdramas like before
[00:14:25.360]  the happy ending there's always like the build up and then they like break up before really being
[00:14:30.720]  together and then they like get back together and everything's happy that beginning part that first
[00:14:35.920]  arc is all just situationship. Dude true it's like potentially like a slow burn but like a toxic
[00:14:42.800]  slow burn. You're like why don't you two just talk to each other? So like are all relationships at
[00:14:48.960]  some point in the beginning situationships? See to me I wouldn't classify it like that
[00:14:55.360]  and maybe this is just because I'm drawing from just my personal experiences right but I feel
[00:15:00.560]  like I would almost classify a situation ship as there's no progress you're like stuck in
[00:15:06.720]  no man's land where it's not going forward and it's not going backwards but if you're
[00:15:10.880]  talking to someone and it's not yet defined but there's still forward moving progress you feel
[00:15:15.840]  like after a couple months will probably be in a different spot or something like that
[00:15:19.920]  then I would still classify that as like dating and not necessarily a situation ship because
[00:15:25.040]  you're not stuck in a situation. No I agree because I feel like in a situation ship there's
[00:15:30.160]  no trajectory where you go from like dating and exclusive and then being finally in a
[00:15:35.760]  relationship you're just stuck in this like situation aka becomes a situation ship. Yeah I
[00:15:43.040]  think I can agree with that too. I think the main factor is that someone has to avoid answering
[00:15:51.200]  questions and then things quickly turn into a situation ship. It only takes one.
[00:15:57.920]  I wonder if like we asked guys the same question if they would define it the same way.
[00:16:02.800]  Yeah I can totally see guys having a different perspective about this because the way I see
[00:16:09.440]  situations ships there's something preventing it from being a real relationship. I think like
[00:16:15.360]  Crystal said communication that's blocked on one side would definitely be a factor but is there
[00:16:20.640]  anything else you think that can sometimes block a situation ship from funneling into a
[00:16:26.160]  relationship? Commitment issues. Wait does that mean if you're in a situation ship that's like
[00:16:32.800]  doomed to fail or are there ways to get out of that bucket? Okay maybe you know if you can get
[00:16:40.400]  out of the friend zone maybe you can get out of the situation zone. That's true never lose hope.
[00:16:45.600]  So what would be those things maybe? Communicating like what you want from the beginning because
[00:16:52.160]  then if you're like also confused and of course it becomes like a confusing situation but if you're
[00:16:58.720]  like oh I do want a relationship then in the beginning you should just be upfront about it and
[00:17:03.120]  be like oh I would want to see this become a relationship and then if the guy is like not
[00:17:07.840]  about it then you should leave because he's not gonna meet your needs. Yeah save that mental energy.
[00:17:14.800]  Exactly. I feel like another thing that comes to mind is pride and I feel like I can kind of
[00:17:22.400]  go like many different ways. One is if someone is so prideful that they don't want to be the one to
[00:17:27.120]  be like oh I actually really like you I want this to become bigger or the other way could be like
[00:17:33.760]  if you are you know really into this guy maybe investing a lot into him but you're giving up
[00:17:40.160]  part of yourself to like continue to stay in the situation ship. I feel like there's different
[00:17:44.800]  sides of the pride spectrum that can kind of feed into the situation ship continuing.
[00:17:50.160]  I also wonder if like people make that decision quickly this person is the situation ship
[00:17:56.240]  relationship or this person is dating. Oh maybe it's if they can't make that decision quickly
[00:18:04.320]  like oh I still don't know. Like can't make that decision quick enough. Yeah like if this person
[00:18:09.600]  is relationship material or if I'm ready for a relationship okay maybe if like you personally
[00:18:18.000]  feel like it's wrong timing or something that could prevent a relationship too and then
[00:18:23.840]  cause the situation ship. I agree timing is also a big factor I feel like timing and compatibility
[00:18:29.600]  and also if you're like on the same life path it's hard to get all of it to work out sometimes
[00:18:36.800]  and then it just becomes a situation ship if you don't really see a future too. Oh my god
[00:18:41.600]  do you guys know the show slash book slash movie one day? Yes. No. Okay well I think one day is a
[00:18:51.440]  situation ship. Yes a very long one. The gist of the story is these two best friends they kind of
[00:18:59.120]  develop feelings for each other but then they only see each other like one day every year or
[00:19:04.000]  something. Oh yeah that's a situation ship. It's like a 10 year one right or like 20 years. Yeah
[00:19:12.560]  like something super long so is it kind of like they're probably like really compatible
[00:19:17.440]  they like each other but then timing wise it just doesn't make sense. Yeah and then they kind
[00:19:22.560]  of like see other people in between because you know they don't really see each other all
[00:19:28.480]  that often and they never like define their relationship and they don't really tell each
[00:19:33.760]  other either throughout many points they kind of just like sweep it under the rug. They're like well
[00:19:39.520]  this is my life now. I remember you have the movie before sunrise do you know that one? I have
[00:19:47.520]  not watched it but I've heard of it. These two people meet while traveling and they like have
[00:19:52.800]  this awesome date together but then they're just traveling so they like meet for like 24 hours
[00:19:57.600]  and then they go to their respective homes and then they meet again like 10 years later
[00:20:02.160]  in a different film. Oh wait what? In a different film? So the first it's like a three film series.
[00:20:11.360]  The first movie is about their first time meeting and then I think they film the next one like
[00:20:15.920]  five ten years later like their second time meeting and then a couple years later the third
[00:20:20.320]  time so they're like actually older. That's like a right person wrong time situation ship.
[00:20:27.840]  Do we believe in that? I think maybe for the most situations I think it's
[00:20:35.520]  overcomable but I think there's definitely moments where maybe it really is kind of just like
[00:20:42.720]  wrong time. Yeah I feel like I don't really believe in it because if the saying is right
[00:20:47.280]  person wrong time then why would it be the right they can't be the right person if it's
[00:20:52.160]  the wrong time. Yeah exactly exactly I guess I kind of feel like there's probably a handful of
[00:20:58.480]  people who are like right enough you know like they're right but like just enough and then there's
[00:21:04.960]  probably like the person who's actually like really right maybe not just one person but
[00:21:10.160]  less people than the right enough people. Jesus playing a game of probability. Like 90 90%
[00:21:17.600]  right versus the 95% right. No I agree that makes sense because there's probably a right person
[00:21:24.800]  for every time. Oh my god true I like that. That actually makes sense as we kind of discuss these
[00:21:33.680]  things though I am kind of changing my mind a little bit on what situation ship means because
[00:21:39.200]  I think we talked a lot about like some of the negative aspects of a situation ship but it does
[00:21:45.120]  kind of feel like something can only really qualify as a situation ship versus a fling if there's some
[00:21:50.400]  sort of more potential there so whether it's the right person wrong time or maybe your expectations
[00:21:55.840]  just don't align but it's like slightly more serious than a fling so I'm curious on what you
[00:22:03.440]  guys think are like the pros and cons of a situation ship versus a real relationship
[00:22:09.440]  or versus something more casual like a fling. So many layers. Is there a pro to a situation ship?
[00:22:19.520]  Yeah I'm gonna say no. Maybe if you're in the driver's seat. I feel like it's just confusing
[00:22:29.360]  overall and I rather have something casual or something serious so it's like you know what
[00:22:35.680]  one or the other is versus something that is like both equally casual and serious it's hard to
[00:22:43.600]  because I feel like in a relationship you see this person as someone you like and potentially
[00:22:48.720]  could be a life partner I feel like at our age. I think that's how it goes once you start seeing
[00:22:55.680]  someone and it becoming more serious then you're bound to think like oh what could this
[00:23:01.840]  potential be and could it lead to something more but then if you're consistently like stuck in
[00:23:07.280]  like a confusing aspect then you're like your brain literally like just racks back and forth between
[00:23:14.160]  is this serious or is this not and then why waste all that emotional capacity on that when you
[00:23:19.440]  could be just dating someone who is on the same page as you. True well I feel like there's like
[00:23:25.840]  a pro to everything so if I were to think of a pro of a situation ship it's like even
[00:23:30.960]  those confusing moments could be good learning lessons where you can like learn about yourself
[00:23:36.080]  and like almost like a trial relationship where there's less pressure or you're like this isn't
[00:23:42.000]  going to last let's try something new here. So maybe the pro comes later in situation ship.
[00:23:47.840]  The pros are the lessons. Yeah the lessons learned. I don't need any more lessons.
[00:23:54.720]  Sounds like a relationship boot camp or something. I know how many lessons before we
[00:24:00.000]  meet the one. How many lessons before we know how to communicate properly.
[00:24:06.800]  You can be like oh like this is how this person doesn't communicate.
[00:24:12.800]  You're like I should avoid this in the future. Like wow this thing really upset me.
[00:24:21.680]  That's a pro you get you learn more about what upsets you. Yeah you're like this doesn't work
[00:24:28.480]  with you. You're like you know what situations are not for me. That's the real lesson.
[00:24:37.040]  Okay low key though if I were to think of a specific pro I can kind of see situations ships
[00:24:44.480]  being like very fun and I can totally get how it's like emotionally intensive and
[00:24:51.280]  you know laborious in a sense on like how much you have to like pour into the
[00:24:55.440]  situation ship but I feel like there's a certain halo effect to not getting resolution and to like
[00:25:00.560]  not having sort of the answers to everything. I feel like it could be very stimulating which
[00:25:06.720]  may be in the long run is not good but I feel like in the short term it can be very intensely
[00:25:11.200]  passionate and fun. Yeah like in the moment maybe like it can be fun like a short and sweet
[00:25:17.760]  before it goes downhill. So you got to do it while you're young while you have energy.
[00:25:23.280]  That's true. Oh wait do old people have situations? Oh my god good question. Oh my god okay question
[00:25:31.360]  like if you're in the middle of a divorce is that a situation ship? Wait like with your
[00:25:38.240]  like the wife and husband. I feel like that would just be like you're in the middle of a
[00:25:44.160]  divorce. Like not that you're in a situation because it's quite defined like oh that's my
[00:25:49.600]  divorce partner. But they're taking a long time to sign the papers like you know in the movies. Oh
[00:25:55.200]  like will they or will they not sign it? No I think at that point they're just your ex. Yeah I'm
[00:26:01.840]  starting to think Crystal doesn't know what a situation ship is. But in that moment maybe you
[00:26:06.960]  can date someone and like or like. Oh yeah and then you can have a situation ship. Yeah while
[00:26:12.960]  you're getting divorced. Yeah and going back now that we went fast forward in time if we were
[00:26:18.320]  to go back like what do the young people do? I mean I feel like situations ships in high school are so
[00:26:25.680]  common right? Like maybe I'm just drawing from all of my situations ships in high school but I feel
[00:26:30.800]  like high school is the perfect breeding ground because no one fucking knows how to date no one
[00:26:35.600]  knows how to communicate. You barely know how to talk to someone of the opposite gender. I
[00:26:39.920]  feel like everything is very exciting and also there's no real reason to commit to a relationship
[00:26:45.520]  that early. So then I feel like a lot of dating in high school is very like situation shipy. I
[00:26:49.920]  agree. I feel like all of high school and middle school dating is very situation ship because like
[00:26:55.360]  you can date someone for a week and then they'll be like bye. But don't they call it like they just
[00:27:01.200]  have a boyfriend for a week? Like it's not. I guess yeah but I feel like it wouldn't really
[00:27:05.520]  classify as a boyfriend because all you do is like hee hee ha ha. That's true. I think like
[00:27:11.440]  when a lot of people they like they're like oh I don't even count that. Yeah exactly. Yeah maybe
[00:27:16.400]  that's like hindsight you're like oh that was a situation ship but in the moment as a young child
[00:27:21.920]  you're like that was my boyfriend. That was the love of my life. I think there was probably like
[00:27:29.120]  one time in high school that would actually qualify as like a real situation ship for me where
[00:27:34.240]  we truly weren't boyfriend and girlfriend but it was kind of like what are we slash
[00:27:38.800]  TBD on the TTR kind of situation? I feel like what I found very weird about it was even though a
[00:27:45.280]  situation ship isn't a real relationship I felt like we started to go through like a real like a
[00:27:50.080]  legitimate breakup and I was kind of like how come it's something that isn't that formal or
[00:27:56.400]  serious or official seeming but the end you still have to make it like official. Oh true I feel
[00:28:02.960]  like there are like breakups to situation ships like there's like an ending. Yeah I guess because
[00:28:09.680]  you're essentially explaining why you're cutting them off or like why you can't be in a relationship
[00:28:16.640]  yeah yeah because I think you can't really just go back to being friends let's say if you did
[00:28:21.280]  start out as friends like in high school but since there was like a romantic aspect involved and
[00:28:26.800]  it's like really hard to just like oh yeah we're friends again buddy hey buddy
[00:28:32.160]  is there a timeline for how long or short it can be? I don't think so but I do think that there's
[00:28:39.440]  like this whole thing on tiktok where it's like a three month rule I do think it's we should follow
[00:28:43.680]  that when something starts and then three months after is when like people start showing you their
[00:28:49.520]  true colors because if people are usually like the best they can be in the beginning and then
[00:28:54.640]  in that three months is like when you figure it out if this is the person you want to be with
[00:29:00.720]  and if they're showing you the best or worse. That's true I feel like the three month mark
[00:29:05.280]  is when people have that conversation like what are we? Yeah do you think there are maybe like
[00:29:12.080]  unspoken rules in a situation ship? Are there certain things you're allowed to expect
[00:29:18.880]  or is it just like you can't expect anything? I think if there was like some communication of
[00:29:24.800]  what you expected then I think it's okay to expect these things but I don't think you should
[00:29:32.240]  expect anything in a situation ship because I feel like it's not like an actual
[00:29:37.520]  committed relationship where you have security and like a sense of that person's
[00:29:41.840]  going to be there for a while so basically all fair game I would say if they were to like do stuff
[00:29:48.800]  that you wouldn't be able to get mad because essentially you're not in a relationship. Yeah I
[00:29:54.720]  feel like you can't expect to know them outside of just like your guys as a relationship like you
[00:29:59.680]  shouldn't expect to meet their friends or like you know outside of that relationship what they
[00:30:04.480]  do but in a relationship like you expect to kind of like meet their friends family and like
[00:30:10.800]  get to know them outside of even the relationship context. Okay how about this do you think in a
[00:30:18.000]  situation ship you have the right to be jealous? I think you personally have a right to be jealous
[00:30:27.920]  but if you did not communicate in wanting it to be exclusive or them like not dating other people
[00:30:36.240]  while you guys are together then I don't think you have the right if you haven't communicated that
[00:30:42.000]  or you don't have the right to get like upset at them. Yeah because I guess you could you could
[00:30:46.640]  still have like boundaries in a situation ship right? Yeah of course. Yeah I feel like these
[00:30:52.640]  things that you can't expect from a situation ship feel like it would be so hard to not expect
[00:31:00.160]  those things you know what I mean? Right? I know theoretically like oh it's just a situation
[00:31:04.720]  ship it's not a real relationship therefore of all x y and z but then I feel like if I were to be
[00:31:09.600]  in that situation like I would still feel all of these things and maybe you would turn into like
[00:31:14.160]  resentment about why we are this way or even like self-loathing in a sense of like oh this person
[00:31:19.920]  seems fine but like how come I'm so emotionally invested? Dude that's why I feel like 99% of
[00:31:25.760]  them become toxic. Yeah that's so true because of that you know yeah no one's really
[00:31:33.040]  communicating so no one's getting their needs met so. Okay I have a question have any of you
[00:31:39.440]  experienced a situation ship where it actually successfully exited situation ship and like
[00:31:47.520]  maybe kind of went into relationship? I want to say yes yes yes sir.
[00:31:54.160]  It's too many yes sir. I think I might be a no. There's some denial in there.
[00:32:05.600]  Oh wait I think so too because I think like I don't a lot of the times like when I'm single
[00:32:11.360]  and I'm dating like I don't go into the mindset of like I'm gonna find my life partner
[00:32:16.160]  I kind of go in the mindset of like oh if I like this person I'll see them again
[00:32:20.080]  and also I feel like it gets to a point where you have to talk about oh I think I'm starting to like you
[00:32:26.160]  we're doing a lot of basically relationship-y things where do you see yourself going from this
[00:32:32.000]  and then eventually I feel like either it's a yes or no so. Yeah and then after that talk that
[00:32:38.000]  like evolves into a real relationship. Yeah exactly. So basically you two are able to
[00:32:46.240]  communicate and that helps you get out of the situation. Yeah that's key. Hell yeah
[00:32:53.600]  if you can't make that leap then it just ends there. Do you think so if you are the person who
[00:33:00.480]  is developing feelings for the other person in a situation ship and you muster up the courage
[00:33:05.680]  to have that convo right like oh I think I like you beyond what the situation ship is do you
[00:33:10.720]  think you also have to brace yourself in case that person says no to go into like a full breakup?
[00:33:17.040]  Oh maybe it's like you have to prepare yourself remind yourself what your boundaries are. Yeah
[00:33:23.200]  I think it depends on whether or not you're looking for a relationship out of him and that's why
[00:33:28.480]  you're saying like hey I like you I want a DTR versus hey I like you and that's it.
[00:33:35.360]  So like is it a personal deal breaker? Yeah depends on what you want essentially from that relationship.
[00:33:41.920]  I can totally imagine someone confessing and then the other person's like oh like I don't know yeah
[00:33:48.080]  I can't really give you an answer on you know like labels and stuff and the original person is just
[00:33:53.760]  like okay that situation continues. No I feel like it usually goes along the lines like oh I like
[00:34:00.960]  you too but I don't know if I'm ready for a relationship usually they like you back right
[00:34:06.080]  they're not ready to like make the leap yeah and then you're just stuck back in the situation ship.
[00:34:12.480]  Yeah exactly you're like sounds good you're like trying to get all out of the hole but no they pull
[00:34:16.720]  you right back into it. You're like should we circle back next month? Yeah exactly. Well I'm just visualizing this time.
[00:34:24.320]  Trying to get out of the hole and they pull us back. They're like lol. No like dirt.
[00:34:34.080]  I do want to circle back to your guys's like success stories of converting a situation ship
[00:34:39.840]  into a real relationship because I think what we were talking about before kind of classified
[00:34:45.920]  situations ships as like 90% toxic so for these success stories would you say that
[00:34:52.240]  that situation ship part of that relationship was toxic or would you think it was like the 10%
[00:34:57.920]  like it truly was just a healthy situation ship that eventually evolved? If it doesn't involve
[00:35:03.440]  into a relationship then then it just becomes toxic. So like up to a point it can be okay.
[00:35:10.720]  Because I think that's the confusing aspect or it becomes like the toxic part of it because
[00:35:16.160]  no one's getting their needs met and you're in this limbo there's no trajectory and you don't know
[00:35:22.720]  what the future lies basically so it's like a circle of toxicity I feel like. Do you think that
[00:35:30.560]  in a situation ship maybe more of the toxic situations ships you have to compromise and yield
[00:35:37.600]  more or do you think that the compromises and stuff happen more in a relationship where you are
[00:35:42.800]  expected to be a good partner? Not that you can't be a good partner in a situation. Honestly though
[00:35:48.560]  like it could be like a mutually beneficial situation ship where like maybe you don't want
[00:35:54.000]  a relationship and that person doesn't want to either and you guys can both happily avoid that
[00:35:58.240]  conversation. Honestly, that's true. It's like the movie to all the boys I've loved before
[00:36:06.720]  their relationship started off from a contract.
[00:36:14.000]  Where I love all these like movie examples.
[00:36:19.600]  Chris was pulling all the movie examples for us. But yeah I feel like that is an example of
[00:36:24.960]  something where you're both actually benefiting so I guess that's kind of a pro if it's like
[00:36:29.680]  okay you're both low key just on the same page about being in a situation ship so it's
[00:36:35.440]  like a good thing for a certain amount of time. I think the only thing though is that most of the
[00:36:42.080]  time even if it starts out that way like one person might catch feelings and then that's when I can
[00:36:46.800]  become toxic. Right right. It's like a friend with benefits and someone catches feelings
[00:36:51.600]  and then you're like oh no this is not what we discussed. You're like I thought we were alive.
[00:36:56.720]  Yeah like are we not alive? No it happened. I guess though in a situation ship technically
[00:37:03.920]  both parties do already have feelings in order to like be in the whole situation ship.
[00:37:12.160]  But I guess it's like when someone starts wanting more right? Right when there's like
[00:37:17.840]  differing expectations on either what you currently are with this person or what the
[00:37:23.120]  future holds for you both as a pair. I feel like it's an interesting question in my mind because
[00:37:30.800]  if you have different expectations from your situation ship then you would probably have to
[00:37:36.880]  compromise a little bit or maybe yield your feelings or hold back your feelings so that
[00:37:41.040]  the situation ship can continue if that's the path that you're choosing. But I also feel like in
[00:37:45.680]  a relationship there's a ton of compromising. You are compromising on your schedules and
[00:37:50.800]  on your preferences to make that relationship continue to work and be healthy so then I can
[00:37:55.600]  almost see situationships as allowing you to be more independent or like empowering you to be more
[00:38:00.880]  independent than in the actual relationship. Dude I just had a flashback of like a situation ship
[00:38:08.720]  I had and I remember we were talking a lot and then he was like wait this kind of feels like a
[00:38:13.760]  real relationship but in a bad way. Like the way he said it and I was like oh what does that mean?
[00:38:20.480]  I should step back a bit. That's crazy to say. In a bad way? Well he didn't say in a bad way but
[00:38:28.480]  like I felt like in a bad way. Oh okay okay okay okay. Can you imagine he was like but in a bad way?
[00:38:35.680]  I'm like you'll get them. Get out what the hell? I feel like the other thing too is like
[00:38:42.080]  in a relationship if I have something that I want to bring up that I feel like is not
[00:38:46.400]  positive or healthy then I kind of have some sort of trust of like okay my SO will want to work on
[00:38:52.400]  this and work through this with me but in a situation ship I feel like there's no guarantee
[00:38:56.640]  there's no insurance it's like if I bring this up I may not see this man for the rest of my life.
[00:39:01.280]  You know what I mean? I feel like there's like some level of risk there so then I can also
[00:39:05.440]  see that maybe being more problematic or causing you to kind of hold back like oh is this worth
[00:39:11.680]  having you know like a very serious conversation because if not then I'll just table it for later.
[00:39:17.280]  Yeah I feel like it's just too ambiguous for you to be like confrontational about
[00:39:22.960]  your feelings at the moment you like kind of second guess yourself you're like oh
[00:39:26.560]  should I bring it up should I not and then you usually probably don't end up bringing it up.
[00:39:31.120]  That's true because it's like at that point it's not us it's like me and you it's very separate.
[00:39:36.560]  Exactly. I wonder like are there cultural differences in situationships? Is it different in America
[00:39:43.120]  versus Korea or even west coast east coast? Dude probably. Probably like slight differences.
[00:39:51.680]  Dude I think there's more situationships in big cities. Oh 100%. I think just because
[00:39:59.120]  there's like too many options so you're just like I want to keep my options open.
[00:40:03.360]  Yeah like think of LA and like New York the dating there is so. It's very fast paced.
[00:40:09.920]  Yeah and then suburbs it's like we're about to get married. Yeah actually though.
[00:40:19.520]  Oh my god that's so true. That's true you like skip the situation should you're like I don't
[00:40:23.760]  have time for this. Yeah like where is the ring at? We're either dating or we're not like
[00:40:28.640]  get it together. Like what else? Like take your lane. Yeah and then the big city everyone's like
[00:40:34.160]  yeah I'm not sure there's like five other like dates lined up in the day. Yeah they're like
[00:40:38.800]  I want to drive here and here. Kind of thinking of like city versus suburb
[00:40:45.440]  thing with the whole situation ship maybe another factor to situationships is like
[00:40:51.840]  possibility of other options one or both parties in the situation ship aren't ready to
[00:40:59.120]  let go of other possibilities yet so then it ends up being like a situation ship. You're like hedging
[00:41:06.960]  your bets essentially. I want to put all my eggs in this basket. Yeah true you're like trying out
[00:41:13.680]  different relationships. Multiple situationships. Dude I don't understand it though because I feel
[00:41:20.560]  that's so tiring. Yeah me going on like two dates I'm like I'm done. I'm exhausted. Okay but actually
[00:41:29.600]  like if you're going into dating kind of with the more mindset of like oh I'm just dating for fun
[00:41:36.960]  do you think that also causes more situationships? Yeah if you're not like dating to like meet your
[00:41:44.400]  life partner or like to get married etc etc I think it does that's not in your plan right you're
[00:41:52.000]  not really thinking for the future you're just thinking for the now. I think that's totally fine
[00:41:56.080]  but then maybe you meet someone who is thinking of something like something in the future then
[00:42:00.560]  it's just not aligned and it becomes like a messy situation ship. I have like a random hypothetical
[00:42:07.600]  but I'm very curious to know what everyone's answers are so say you're in a situation ship
[00:42:12.400]  with someone and you don't want it to end but that person is actively dating other people
[00:42:17.600]  and they're open about it like he's like oh I really like you but I'm also dating other people
[00:42:22.320]  but you still like first and foremost really like this person so would you match their energy
[00:42:28.960]  and go out and date other people or would you end the situation ship? I guess the third
[00:42:34.320]  option is you tell them like hey I think this is a deal breaker can you stop seeing other people?
[00:42:39.440]  I don't think I would go date other people unless I knew I had the mental capacity to do that
[00:42:49.200]  I think I'm not- that's a crystal answer
[00:42:51.840]  I'm tired yeah multiple people what? I don't think I'm petty enough to be like let me just
[00:42:59.360]  use the rest of my like strength to go date as many people just to piss off this guy
[00:43:05.040]  but like maybe I would assess the situation you know if I'm like okay I can just like keep a casual
[00:43:12.640]  for a while and see how that goes I probably wouldn't mind that too much but if I was like
[00:43:18.960]  oh no like this has to be a relationship then I would probably draw boundary
[00:43:23.440]  I feel like if they were like super upfront about it in the beginning like say like oh
[00:43:28.560]  I like you but I'm also like seeing other people then I would be like I think that is actually
[00:43:33.120]  very very good because at least you're transparent about what you're doing what what else you're doing
[00:43:38.240]  and you're not lying to the person you're seeing or hiding withholding information so I feel like
[00:43:45.280]  then that creates a whole distrust and then it becomes like a messy situation ship right but
[00:43:50.560]  if they're upfront about it in the beginning I feel like I think personally I would already
[00:43:56.800]  probably be seeing other people too if he had told me that because then then we were like oh we're
[00:44:02.800]  both openly seeing other people we're all kind of both on the same page and then I feel like if
[00:44:07.760]  I end up liking him a lot more then maybe I would be like oh hey I think I really like you
[00:44:13.600]  and I see your relationship with you I don't know if I can continue seeing you if you're
[00:44:18.880]  seeing other people and draw that boundary because then then it gets messy you start feeling
[00:44:23.520]  jealous and like all of that other feelings right I had a situation ship where it was similar
[00:44:29.520]  a little bit different we both liked each other I think we were both still kind of dating other people
[00:44:35.600]  too but then at one point he was like I really like you I wish like you would stop seeing other
[00:44:41.040]  people but then he didn't say he would stop seeing other people so I was like no it can't be one
[00:44:48.960]  sided that's crazy yeah which is very crazy so I'm like either we both stop seeing other people
[00:44:54.960]  or we both continue to date right yeah so respectful yeah so we both just continue
[00:45:04.080]  hey that's a quality baby I love that I love that yeah I was like why is it just me like yeah girl power
[00:45:11.520]  that's so weird for us true yeah I like you so much like I want you to stop seeing others but
[00:45:17.600]  not I'm like I'm like you see other people though that's like that's more like uh I like myself
[00:45:22.960]  so much that I want to stop seeing other people true oh my god the audacity of
[00:45:29.920]  saying that do you think it's fair to ask like what would it take for you to want to be exclusive
[00:45:40.400]  I think so I don't think it's a unfair question to ask but if like they themselves don't know
[00:45:46.160]  what they want they're not going to be able to come up with an answer like maybe that question
[00:45:50.800]  is too hard you know like if someone asked you that like what would you say I'm like
[00:45:58.960]  it's like relationship negotiating yeah I'm like oh they're like sorry I don't know myself
[00:46:05.440]  that well enough yet I know check back in a month I think it's okay to say like check back in a month
[00:46:12.720]  check
[00:46:15.040]  you're like not yet like yeah yeah I think that's fair too to be like oh I need some time to like
[00:46:21.040]  think about this so to wrap up this episode today I do have a final question for everyone
[00:46:27.680]  what are your words of advice for someone who may feel like they're stuck in a toxic
[00:46:32.960]  situation or maybe are just recovering from leaving a toxic situation therapy
[00:46:43.200]  well okay I do think well therapy is helpful in general but I also think it's a good space to
[00:46:49.840]  practice and learn about proper communication styles and then like reflect on that and how you
[00:46:58.640]  can improve yourself because honestly the only thing you can really control in these situations
[00:47:04.800]  is how you act and how you present yourself so if you constantly show your partner healthy practices
[00:47:13.200]  and healthy communication then that will probably hopefully encourage them to reciprocate it they'll
[00:47:19.840]  be like oh well this person is being very transparent and like clear with me so I will try my best to
[00:47:25.680]  also be clear with them and I guess it's also like if even that doesn't work then you know to run
[00:47:30.960]  yeah at least you try yeah exactly I don't know why the first words but I thought of was like protect
[00:47:36.560]  yourself girl run because I don't want people to be like so heartbroken you know over situations
[00:47:46.240]  just at that point you're just testing it out no need to like do everything for this one person
[00:47:52.560]  protect your heart oh and I also feel like you can after a situation ship ends I feel like you
[00:47:59.680]  can take all of that emotional capacity that you focused on the other person and just put it all
[00:48:05.200]  to yourself and like figure out what you want what you like I also think after like an ending
[00:48:11.520]  of a situation ship it can almost be a blessing to like learn from that because you could be like
[00:48:16.240]  oh thank god that was just a situation ship and I didn't have to go through a whole relationship
[00:48:21.760]  to learn those lessons true true and I think it's like a perfect opportunity to
[00:48:28.240]  really focus on yourself after that like you know learn to have fun by yourself with your friends
[00:48:34.320]  and I think when you like you know learn to really trust yourself and feel good about yourself
[00:48:39.520]  then you know you can confidently enter new relationships and you know whether
[00:48:45.760]  that be something that's about to turn into a situation ship or not you will hopefully
[00:48:50.000]  have the trust and confidence in yourself to you know put down the communication draw the right
[00:48:56.080]  boundaries and then prevent any further like terrible or toxic situations yeah definitely
[00:49:04.720]  I guess my advice is probably like very simple but I would say to enjoy it if there's one
[00:49:12.240]  benefit to a situation ship it's that it's can be very enjoyable and if you feel like at a
[00:49:18.400]  certain point it's no longer enjoyable or serving any of your interests then don't be afraid to walk
[00:49:24.080]  away because at the end of the day just a situation ship no biggie he hasn't even met your friends yet
[00:49:29.440]  so just be saddened just enjoy it and end it yeah enjoy it and then if you stop enjoying it
[00:49:35.360]  then don't enjoy it then you run yeah hopping off of that I feel like if you are in a
[00:49:43.600]  situation ship I think the best thing you can do is be transparent and honest about what you want
[00:49:48.480]  and then if they don't they don't want the same thing that's totally okay then you can find someone
[00:49:52.720]  else who does want the same thing and also communication is key really if you're feeling
[00:49:58.000]  something just say it because at the end of the day worst thing they can do is not be on
[00:50:03.760]  the same page and if they're not on the same page then why do you want to take them
[00:50:06.880]  you know or why do you want to be with them well said and I think this is a very fun
[00:50:11.040]  conversation it's always very interesting to pick each other's brains about various
[00:50:17.760]  relationships that we've had and various thoughts and perspectives on on different situations so
