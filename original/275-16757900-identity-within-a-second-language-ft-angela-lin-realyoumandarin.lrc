[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Angela. This week we have an exciting guest. Her name is Angela and she is from RealYouMandarin. So Angela, why don't you take the floor and explain what all of that is?
[00:00:28.700] Yes. Hey guys, thanks for having me on the show. I'm Angela Lin. I'm also a fellow AAPI podcaster, so maybe some of you recognize my voice. I also host the But Where You Really From podcast. But as Crystal mentioned, I founded RealYouMandarin. It's something I started last year. And essentially we offer online Mandarin courses for mainly American-born Mandarin speakers.
[00:00:55.800] So people like us that are more like second generation whose parents immigrated from the motherland. So we kind of balance two or more languages but aren't fully able to express ourselves. Main point being to get people to be able to realistically express their opinions and thoughts like we can in English. So that's why the RealYou part. I think we'll talk about it in more of this episode.
[00:01:21.840] But last year, essentially, I had a lot of thoughts around language and I was like, if you can't express yourself through a different language, you really are locked into like a very small portion of who you are. So that's why the RealYou Mandarin, like RealYou part, if you only can unlock, I don't know, a third of a language, you're not really expressing your real self in that language.
[00:01:47.780] And so the goal of RealYou Mandarin is to help people like us, the ones of us who speak Mandarin, but people like us be able to express more of your authentic self in Mandarin. I really like that because oftentimes we talk about, do you speak another language, whatever. And I think every time we have that conversation, I think about one, my Korean language abilities and also two, language classes I took back in high school or something where you take AP, whatever.
[00:02:15.360] And to think about language as a form of exploring identity or expressing yourself is a little bit different from how I'm used to thinking about it. I feel like language to me is like vocab. And can you communicate with people like your grandma or like local street vendors and not so much? Can I bare my soul through this language? Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:02:36.800] I think I also used to think of it that way, but I've had a lot of different experiences the past two, three years maybe that made me feel more like my personality is so limited right now because of language. So a couple different things. One is I'm married to a Spanish person whose family only speaks Spanish. I grew up learning Spanish. I think a lot of us, you know, California people, the second language, many people end up taking in school is Spanish.
[00:03:06.120] So I was like, oh, I know Spanish. I also minored in it in college, but it's very different from trying to have, you know, meaningful conversations with people. And so the first time I really was like, whoa, I, they don't even know who I am was when I first was like really engaging with my in-laws and they were like, wow, Angela's really quiet. And I was like, girl, I'm not quiet. I'm trying to like, I'm trying to process what you're saying.
[00:03:32.340] And then I'm trying to, you know, when there's like a group dynamic and multiple people are speaking, if you are still trying to translate what someone's saying, you can't even jump in in time to like engage in that conversation. So I noticed a lot of times they'd like already move on to the next topic before I thought of what to say back in Spanish. So that was like the first time for me where I was like, whoa, my personality is not coming across right now. And then the last two and a half years, we were digital nomads.
[00:04:00.560] So we were living in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. And I have varying abilities to communicate in those different languages. So that also really became apparent to me when you're trying to immerse in a society versus like, you know, your one week vacation. I think no one really cares if you can or can't speak the local language. But if you're trying to kind of live somewhere, it becomes more and more apparent of the roadblocks when you can't properly communicate something.
[00:04:29.020] And if you're trying to make friends, it's also kind of tough when you are so limited with your vocab. All these different things, I think, kind of bubbled up in me where I was like, oh, my God, language is so important. I didn't realize until all of these experiences. I can totally relate for being in a different country. I think that's probably a big one for me. Recently, just last year, I went to China with my mom.
[00:04:53.500] Honestly, like in a day-to-day situation here, I would consider my Mandarin like pretty passable. I can like speak to my parents for the most part, probably like 70 to 80 percent in Mandarin. But sometimes you don't realize how simplified it is until you go out. There's other people, everyone around you is speaking Chinese or whatever language. And then suddenly you're like, wait, why do I feel like extra stupid today?
[00:05:22.060] Or maybe you're like, I'm really slow today. I think the craziest part was sometimes people would say something to me and it would take a second for me to like register what they said. And in that like second of panic, I would turn to my mom and she would kind of just like re-say the exact same thing that they said. And I'm like, wait, why did it not like make sense when they said it? But in my mom's voice, suddenly I understand. Whoa, that's so interesting. I totally vibe with that.
[00:05:49.320] I mentioned I spent time in Taiwan too and my family is from Taiwan. So I think especially if you went back to your motherland with your families, mostly, if that's like your main experience being on the motherland, you might have this false sense of fluency because you don't realize until you go by yourself, like fending for yourself, how much you rely on your family.
[00:06:12.360] I had this realization as well because two years ago, maybe, or like a year and a half ago, I brought my in-laws and my husband to Taiwan. Yes, my family was there, but we were staying on like an Airbnb separate from them. And I was kind of playing host, even though I'm like, this ain't my country. Like, I don't know. I don't know where to take you or anything. So I was like the main point and the only person who could speak Mandarin. And that's when I realized like, whoa, I don't know anything.
[00:06:39.040] And I think for me, and I say this a lot when I talk about really Mandarin stuff, but when you talked about like feeling either you speak really simplified or like you feel slower that day or whatever. For me, the way I think about it is I feel like a kid when I speak Mandarin. And a lot of that is vocab. So Jisoo earlier mentioned vocab. It is a huge part of it. I think a big part for me is that I learned Mandarin with my family growing up, speaking at home. I also went to Chinese school.
[00:07:08.820] Crystal, I don't know if they forced you to go to Chinese school, but yeah, a lot of us did that. But you only learn up to like an elementary school kids level. So if you think about it, you're like, my vocab is limited to literally a child level. And you mentioned talking to your family at home, maybe 70 to 80% in Mandarin, right? And I think that's also part of our like, we don't think about it much, but what we really speak is Chinglish or Conglish.
[00:07:36.940] If it's Korean, you know, like whatever the mix is, because our parents live here too. So they know some English at least if not fluent. And so when you don't know the vocab word, you just learn the English and they get it and you just move on. And you never learn the word because they're not like, oh, actually, this is how you would say it in the mother language. And so you never need it to build up your vocab. So for me, when I think about it, it's like, oh, I'm just a kid. Like, that's really what it comes down to is it feels like I'm a kid. Everything's just like this.
[00:08:05.660] You get what I'm saying, but it's very low level. Yeah. I think it's especially interesting because in Korean, there's also an added layer of honorifics. I think a lot of Asian languages have some layer in that, but it's a little bit more explicit with Korean where you your entire sentence structure is a little bit different when you're speaking to people who are older than you or higher status than you.
[00:08:28.300] And I personally am so used to using that because when you talk to your Korean school teachers or to your parents or like to your family and relatives, you use the honorifics or at least I do. The challenging part for me is not going back and talking to my aunts, uncles or like grandma, grandpa. It's talking to my cousins because with people who are peers or your age, you want to have a personality. With adults, I feel like sometimes it's a little bit okay to be like a wallflower and just be polite and like sitting there.
[00:08:57.000] But with cousins, it's like I want to banter. I want to joke and be funny and like show who I am. But it's so hard when the language that I know is not really suited for like joking. I don't know how to make a pun in Korean, you know? Yo, the pun thing is so real. So we're moving to Japan end of this year. So I've been like really dedicating to learning Japanese. And I recognized my first pun two months ago. I was in Japan. Someone said a pun. They were like, do you get it?
[00:09:27.020] I'm like, I do. I actually got it. But yeah, it's a whole different part of a language. When it's outside of textbook or formal language, it's really more just everyday and interpersonal. Yeah, that was actually a thought I kind of had in like recent years as well, where I was like, oh, I don't know if I'm even capable of cracking jokes, even if it's very simple in Chinese.
[00:09:49.440] So I'm like, my parents probably just think I'm like stone cold, you know, like no humorless person just talking in these like very basic like third grade terms and stuff. To them, it's funny when I mispronounce a word or like use something incorrectly. Right. I think to a certain extent, that's why sometimes when I see my parents with their friends and they're super funny, like being a comedian, I'm just like, whoa, there's like a whole different side of you.
[00:10:17.720] Not that they're not funny at home, but it's just the level of joke that they're able to make with their friends who are, you know, super, super fluent in Korean is different from what we can joke about as like a household. That's true. My dad laughs a lot with his friends. I'm like, where's this roaring laughter at home? Yeah, I'm like, I wonder how many jokes have just flown over our heads. And then they're like, anyone? Like, anyone? Crickets. Tough crowd.
[00:10:48.400] That actually also makes me think about, I guess, just our parents or other immigrants experiences in America as well. I immigrated here when I was four. So a lot of the tough English language learning experience, I don't really remember. Right. And it happened very young. So it's not like a traumatic memory or something that I had to like relive and even in my adulthood. But for my parents, they immigrated here in their early to mid thirties.
[00:11:16.960] And I think learning to speak English in a professional capacity and in your daily life, 100% of the time is so challenging and different. I can't imagine going to Korea now, even with my current level of fluency and like really living there full time. So it just makes me have a lot of respect for my parents and other immigrants who have to do that adjustment when they're older. I completely agree. As someone who's trying to move back to Asia and not even to have my thing is called really Mandarin. I'm trying to move to Japan.
[00:11:45.500] So I'm like literally going to a totally different society. I had so much more respect for my parents, same as you. Once I started having to do the same, I'm like, I'm a grown adult. This is like not as easy as if you're four or five years old, you kind of absorb things a lot more easily. My parents were the same. They moved here when they were in their mid to late thirties.
[00:12:08.420] And I think even with dating, I remember resenting my mom a little bit growing up because she kept trying to hammer into me like you need to marry a Chinese speaking boy because that's the only way it's going to work for our family. I was like, aren't you being a little dramatic? But now I'm married to someone who does not speak Chinese. And I get it because I have to translate kind of everything. My mom and dad have different levels of English, which is common.
[00:12:35.720] I think when you move, when you're already an adult, it's not necessarily going to be the case that you both absorb language the same way. It's like my dad is much more fluent in English than my mom. She understands English better than she speaks. I think she just doesn't have confidence to like speak it out much. So then we often end up in this scenario where we're speaking in English. My mom understands what my husband says and then responds to me in Chinese. And then I have to like respond back for her.
[00:13:05.020] So I totally get the struggle. And some people never fully feel comfortable in it after, even when, you know, they've lived here forever. Now my whole life, they've now lived here, but she still is more comfortable in Mandarin than English. So yeah, a lot of respect for moving to a different place and starting from scratch when you're well into your adult life.
[00:13:28.180] Yeah, I think I got my first taste of the translating for someone who's communicating with your family recently because my brother is dating someone who doesn't speak Mandarin. And they came to visit together a couple of times. I really started to realize it's so easy to get left behind in conversation if you're the only one who doesn't know what's happening. And I think my brother was also kind of getting used to that, too. So it was almost like we're tag teaming translating for her. I would notice sometimes he forgot.
[00:13:57.920] So I'd jump in and let her know what happened. And then sometimes I felt really bad if everyone burst out into laughter and she's like the only one who doesn't know. And you have to like catch her up on it. Oh, by the way, this was the joke. And then like when you have to explain the joke, sometimes it's a bit like, OK, haha, that was funny. But I miss the I miss the moment. Yeah, I've been with my husband for like almost 10 years now and he is Chinese.
[00:14:25.240] So his parents luckily speak awesome English. A lot of their family friends speak great English. But sometimes when you're just comfortable and in like a family dinner setting or something like people slip back into Mandarin, which is completely understandable. And in those moments, we've had a ton of learnings where it's like, what are the right statements to translate? What's like the best moment to translate? And I speak a little bit of Mandarin and I can understand some of it. You know, for him, he's probably trying to figure out like, oh, what does she understand?
[00:14:53.900] And like, what does she not understand? And this past holiday season was so funny because he would translate all the things that I did understand. And then none of the things that I didn't understand. Maybe he also didn't know it. He's like, maybe she won't notice if I don't translate these things. Like we need to sit down and go through my my curriculum so I could tell you what to translate. That is so funny. Yo, props to you for knowing some Mandarin. That's hard. It's very basic.
[00:15:25.440] What I've sometimes done, just like when I'm out traveling, is I sneakily pull out my phone and do the, you know, Google Translate where it's like, listen. And I'll just have it like real time translate. I'm like, oh, okay, I kind of got some of this. But like, it's hard. Maybe I get to translate two sentences and then I'm like, oh, shoot, I'm missing the rest of everything while I'm reading what this translation was. Yeah, it's tough. It's really tough when you're not fully capable of translating just live on the spot.
[00:15:53.860] And I also think with our mother languages, our parents' mother languages, there's an element of like, Crystal, you mentioned when you were in China recently, you were kind of like, do I get what's happening? Maybe I don't. So for me, I only fully realized what was happening until I was trying to make this course. But I always feel like I say I'm fluent in Mandarin.
[00:16:15.680] But when I hear people speak, a lot of times I don't actually know what they're saying because there's like so much vocab or there's like, like GC mentioned honorifics. I think in Chinese, there is also there are different levels of formality, but there's also a kind of like written versus spoken and there's like news versus like normal. So depending on the situation, I don't know what they're saying at all.
[00:16:38.950] But because the maybe it's like the accent or like just the tonality, I'm like, this feels so familiar to me. It's like I understand it. And then when I think about it, I'm like, no, I got none of it. I got none of that. But why do I feel like I knew it? I don't know if you guys have that feeling. But I think for a lot of people who grew up with a language, that can be this false sense of understanding that we have because it just sounds so familiar.
[00:17:06.750] But then you're like, wait, how much of that should I really get? I've definitely had moments like that, too, where I'm like, yeah, I think I'm following along. And then it's like, oh, wait, actually, what? What did they just say? I think that especially rings true when the topics that you're discussing are more complex, right? Like if I'm talking about my day to day, like what did you do in school or like whatever? I feel like it's very much like, oh, math was hard. It was super simple vocab.
[00:17:32.670] But when you start speaking to people as like a late 20s person and they're like, what do you do for work? I'm like, how do you say analyst in Korean? Like, I don't know how to explain what revenue is in Korean. You know, it's just a little bit more challenging. And that's already like more basic, I would say. Anything like politics or government, international, current affairs, like that kind of stuff. I can't even imagine discussing in Korean. That's so true.
[00:17:59.910] I keep asking my parents, how would you say my job like graphic designer in Chinese? And my mom was like, well, I'm going to be honest. I don't even know. I was like, dude, this is not helpful. That happens a lot. Honestly, my parents, I think they're also in a different situation than some other folks who immigrated to the US because they still spend half their time in Taiwan. They kind of split their time. So I'm like, yeah, they're super native. But a lot of times I ask them similar things.
[00:18:29.230] They're like, I don't know. I don't know how to say that. I'm like, but you are the authority. How can you not know? And to the job thing, I have a funny story about that too. I used to work at VH1. So like MTV, Viacom, those kinds of things. And I was in marketing. So I was not on TV. But every single time my mom talked to a friend about what I did for work, they're like, oh, she's like on TV. I'm like, girl, I'm not on TV. We're behind the scenes. That's so funny.
[00:18:58.210] Yeah, I think when my parents don't know, they default to like, oh, she's like an artist or something. And I'm like, wait, that's not quite. That's like, I don't really draw. Like it's pretty different. I'm terrible at drawing. Yeah. I think everyone in my family knows of my husband being in IT. He's like an engineer. And then they think I'm in finance. And I'm like, you know what? That's just close enough. It's not even worth explaining. I think it's interesting too, because computers started really getting popular
[00:19:27.610] when our parents were 20s to 30s probably. And so I feel like some of these newer jobs or like newer job functions, our parents might not even quite know. Like, do they know what UI UX is? Yeah, right? Doubt it. Also, some of those words, they only learned once they moved to the US, right? So they probably learned it in English only. I never really thought about what is that in Woe. You know, the mother's father.
[00:19:57.590] So true. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like, some of these job-related words, it might be up to us to learn. And yeah, you teach them a new Korean or Chinese word. Do you ever, when you're having conversations with, maybe not your parents, because I do think when we talk to our parents, there's not a dumbing down, but there's the mix of English and the other language, right? So you were able to say what you want. But when I'm talking to my cousins, you mentioned that. Oh my gosh.
[00:20:26.510] Every time I'm back in Taiwan, talking to my adult cousins or like peers of that nature, I just move on. If there are words they said and I did not know what they said, I just move on and pretend like I did. Because I'm like, I don't want to draw attention to the fact that I didn't understand this. Or it's not like that important to keeping the conversation flowing or I'll kill the vibe or something. So I feel like a lot of times that also impedes my own learning because I'm like, I should just ask them, like, what does that mean?
[00:20:55.490] It shouldn't be embarrassing because they know I grew up in the US. Like, why would I know 100% of what they're saying? It's so funny that you mentioned that because I don't know if you guys remember this episode in Friends, but there's this one episode where Joey, who is like an actor, he's like, oh, I have this trick. Whenever I forget my lines, I just pretend like I'm smelling old cheese or something like that. And then he like has this face that he makes where he kind of like gazes into the distance.
[00:21:21.230] I feel like I must have a face like that when I don't understand a word because I was talking to my cousin recently and it was about like a very sensitive topic. We were talking about kids and, you know, preparing for pregnancy and, you know, more sensitive things like having a miscarriage and things like that. She mentioned the term miscarriage and I think I just didn't know what that term was in Korean. So I think I made that face and then she dumbed it down literally to like when you lose your baby.
[00:21:49.330] And I was just like, damn, it's crazy that she has to like explain things like that to me. Oh my God. Very simplistic language. She's like, God damn this. She's like, do I really have to spell this out? No, but I'm definitely the same. I think I give this like blank stare and I just kind of nod. I'm like, uh, yeah. And they're like, actually, that was a question. Like you're supposed to answer. Yeah, it's tough. And it's, I don't know.
[00:22:16.810] I think talking about sensitive topics or like more complex nuances and whatnot, like this is a lot of how you really get to know someone instead of just talking about like very surface level things. So to a certain extent, sometimes I'm like, damn, well, my cousins really know who I am on the inside. You're like, what if you guys learned English? Yeah, I feel that so much. That's actually why.
[00:22:46.930] So all the topics that we cover in Real You Mandarin are these real topics. So there is one that is around specifically the lesson is pressures around marriage and children. So there's this, I think many people have these conversations with their parents, especially when they're pre-marriage and stuff. And they're like, when are you going to get married? Like, I'm not getting any younger. We're giving you some kids already, you know, like grandkids already. But through that lesson, we also teach things like, I think miscarriage is one of our vocab
[00:23:13.610] words and IVF and all the things like a lot of us are talking about already in English with our peers. But if you wanted to talk about that with your cousins or other people back in Asia, you would realize pretty quickly, like, you don't know those words. That's kind of our motivation behind the course is we want to give people this like jumpstart into knowing what it would feel like to have a realistic conversation about these types of topics.
[00:23:42.010] So earlier, you also mentioned like politics and stuff. We actually made this course last year. So it was before the actual election. But like, we did make a lesson around talking about the election. And it's everything you already talk about in like normal life. But how would you do that in Mandarin? Obviously can't cover everything, right? But I do like to think it gives you confidence into starting to have those conversations with people you want to have them with.
[00:24:08.090] You kind of can anticipate what someone might say in response because it is meant to be very realistic. So that's how we kind of approach that instead of like, here's just 500 vocab words for you to memorize. It's really in the context of what that conversation might actually be where you use that vocab word. I think that's pretty helpful because there are definitely moments that we've all described so far where maybe you like didn't recognize a word and then you ask, what did that mean?
[00:24:37.410] Or you kind of just like let it pass. But when that happens, it's so quick. Maybe in that one second, you're like, oh, okay, now I know what that word means. But then later, like probably the next day, you'll be like, oh, shoot, how do you say miscarriage again? Right. And so I feel like having a course to like really nail it in probably helps a lot. And I feel like it would not to say that we're just small talking with our parents, but to a certain extent, if your vocabulary is limited, I feel like that could be the
[00:25:06.750] default path that you go down. Keep the conversation very simple and light. Just talk about things that you are comfortable talking about and then just move on with your day and keep the complex stuff for your friends. So I feel like having that base to be able to have those conversations and also at the same time putting your own effort into it, right? And not just expecting your parents to learn the English version of it. It's really cool. Yeah. Dude, this kind of reminds me though. There was a phrase that I didn't know until probably like beginning of last year.
[00:25:36.670] And I was so shocked that I never asked or learned how to say this. It's awkward in Mandarin. And my dad was saying something one day and he was like, yeah, I was like feeling kind of awkward because like someone put me in a weird spot at work. And I was like, what does that word mean? And he's like, dude, I don't even know. So we looked it up together and we're like, oh, it means awkward. But literally like maybe two weeks later, I completely forgot the word.
[00:26:02.270] So I had to ask one of my friends who is much better at Chinese and they're like, oh, yeah, this is how you say awkward. And I was like, OK, I need to commit this to memory because this is like a very useful word for some reason. I have never used it, even though I do feel awkward a lot. I think it was also eye opening because I was like, oh, wait, my parents can also feel this feeling. I just never knew the phrase for it. Like how many times have they been like, oh, actually, I feel awkward from like this one interaction.
[00:26:29.810] And I was just like, yeah, blank stare and smile. I have two thoughts about that. One is I'm going to keep plugging my course, but that's kind of I mean, it's part of the conversation, right? So the dialogues, I think one of the reasons I wanted this to be like the base way that you learn through our courses is it's not just like watching it. I think there's only so much you can retain when you watch something. It's about doing it as well.
[00:26:58.290] So I only learned this technique called shadowing when I started learning Japanese. But essentially, we encourage people to play the conversation, which is role playing between me and the Mandarin teacher partner that I worked with. We want people to shadow what we say. So basically, when you play it, you're trying to mimic what we're saying at the same time that we speak so that you are getting the practice in with your own mouth, like how to
[00:27:26.350] say that not only the vocab that is new to you in the context of the conversation you want to have, but also the natural speed and like the tone, the type of expression you might have when you're saying those things. So that way you've already felt what it feels like to have that conversation. It'll feel more familiar to you later on when you do try to have that conversation. And also, we kind of help people try to hammer it in.
[00:27:51.930] I have that happen all the time where I hear a new word and I just like forget it later. I'm like, I swear I learned this two days ago, but I don't remember it. Something that I've been using for many years, I think a lot of language learners know this app as well, something called Anki. It's like a digital flashcard system. It's open source. So you can kind of just like do whatever you want with it. But for us, we pre-built Anki digital flashcards for people of the main vocab words in these lessons.
[00:28:19.770] And they all have the Chinese, the pinging, the English translation, a sample sentence and the audio pronunciation. And essentially what Anki does is like instead of just being paper flashcards, you just kind of like go through it, right? And you like throw it away or forget it. Anki is algorithmic. So it essentially shows you different flashcards in varying frequencies based on if you keep getting it right or wrong. So if you keep getting something wrong, it'll show you more frequently until you get it right.
[00:28:47.970] And so we kind of took the legwork out of it for people. Like for me using Anki for many years now, the biggest annoyance is making the flashcards. She's like, I don't want to take the time to do it. We're like, here you go. Just download it. But we're trying to make it as easy as possible for people to get the practice in of how would I use this vocab with my own mouth? And then also the practice of the vocab with the flashcards.
[00:29:14.310] And then the other point I thought about when you were speaking was, do you guys remember that? Well, it's still out, but I just remember it came out like five years ago, but Parents Are Human card game. So I bought it like right when it came out because I was like, oh, this is so cool. If people don't know what that is, it's this card game that has like very thought provoking questions for your parents. On one side, it's English. The other side, it's started with Chinese, but now it's got like many, many languages.
[00:29:43.590] And the idea being we've probably only unlocked a small portion of our own parents' personalities because we don't ask them about deeper stuff. So I played that game with my parents when it first came out and I thought it was so cool. I learned a lot of stuff that I like never knew about my parents. But when I thought about it kind of recently, I was like, this is a good starting point. But sometimes I don't really know what they're saying back to me when it's these deeper conversations as well.
[00:30:12.150] Or I don't know how to like push it forward more because if I ask it in English, they're kind of like, oh, I don't know. Versus like if I had some more vocabulary around those topics already, maybe I could get deeper. Yeah. I don't know. It's just kind of swirling around in my head. There are so many ways to think about all this stuff. I feel like it's already so challenging to get to know your parents when there's a generation gap. Yes. Especially for our generation and our parents' generation because the technology difference
[00:30:39.450] that we're used to in our daily lifestyle is already so massive. But adding language on top of that just makes it so much harder to get to know them, which is why I mentioned this earlier. But it's so rewarding for me to see my parents engage in their social life where I'm like, damn, you guys are rock stars when you speak Korean. Not that they're not, you know, when they speak English, but it's just that's what they're used to. They're so much more comfortable in that environment. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:04.970] I guess it just goes to show that, you know, maybe they don't know our full personality except from what they can observe and what we communicate, limitedly communicate. But then the vice versa is also very true. I actually also have the, my parents are human card deck. And sometimes I'll just like pull one. I don't tell my parents I have it. I just pull one. And I'm like, oh, this is a pretty good question. I'll ask this at dinner. Sure. It's so true.
[00:31:32.730] Like some of the questions were really basic and I was like, oh my God, I don't know this about my parents. Something like, what was your favorite class or something when you were in school? And I was like, what? Like how, this is such a simple thing that like you probably know a general idea for most of your friends. Like, oh, you know, they were good at this or they liked that certain area of stuff. And you're like, I don't know. What did my parents like? Like, were they forced into their career path or did they choose it?
[00:32:02.050] You know, all that kind of stuff. So I think part of it is as we get older and become like fully fledged adults, sort of, we start to realize like, oh, our parents are just like us. You know, they're not some all knowing being that meets like every single highest standard. It's like, oh, they have personalities too. And they have likes and dislikes and they have strengths and weaknesses. And then once you start to realize that they're people, then you're like, oh, why haven't I
[00:32:30.850] ever had like a real conversation with them? I think it's partially the generation thing is huge. And that's going to be kind of every parent child relationship, honestly. But I think for us, there's that added layer of cultural gap, right? Even with how the parent child relationship is. So I had a whole heart to heart breakdown situation with my parents a few years ago where I was like, you never told me you loved me.
[00:33:00.830] They're like, it's not like my parents ever told me they loved me. You know, I think there's this awakening within ourselves as we get older, where we're realizing all the things we needed growing up and what we still want with those relationships with our parents. And unfortunately, I think a lot of the onus is on us to kind of build that path because they don't necessarily always know how to go about that themselves because they didn't have
[00:33:28.450] that relationship with their parents or it wasn't like culturally how family dynamics work when they were growing up. So it's been something I've been trying to work on too is I'm just like, yeah, I should ask them more questions about themselves. And they're always really happy to answer it. They're never like, oh, why do you care? Or like, who cares? They're just like, oh, yeah. I'm like, why don't we ever talk like this? Yeah, I had a moment recently where I realized there's like a meme on TikTok where you tell
[00:33:58.090] your mom you like this one thing once and then she buys you merch of that thing for the next 20 years. I realized I do that with my parents because I was like talking to my dad and I was like, oh, yeah, dad, like you love strawberries. It's like totally your thing. He's like, I do. And I was like, when I was like 10 that you love strawberries and white chocolate, I thought those were like your top two favorite foods. He was like, oh, I guess I like strawberries. I was like, oh, no, what happened? Like what changed?
[00:34:26.890] Why are you like a fully dynamic person with changing interests? But I will say one thing that I've been finding very rewarding is now that I'm married to my husband, when he comes over and like has conversations with my parents, he's coming with like a completely new perspective and like a different relationship. Right. So he'll ask questions to my dad about like, oh, how's your time in military, like mandatory military service in Korea? And how is this? Or like, what kind of sports do you like playing? I was like, whoa.
[00:34:54.790] And I learned recently that my dad likes to play basketball. And he like knows all the terms, like three pointer, like layup, like fade away. I was like, who are you? Your dad's like finally a fellow man. My dad even mentioned the Uncle Drew thing for like Kyrie Irving. Oh, my God. Yeah. My dad knows ball. Yeah. He's actually like extremely up to date.
[00:35:22.230] I'm thinking about my parents' interests now, too. And I guess like what I mainly get or what I mainly see is maybe if we are like watching something at the dinner table together, or maybe sometimes even if we're like driving in the same car and my parents play like their little Chinese podcast about whatever. But OK, I'm going to be honest. Sometimes these like podcast things are extremely just like out of my league. I'm like, yeah, I just hear Chinese happening.
[00:35:51.590] But like, I'm not really absorbing what they're saying. So I know for a bit my parents were actually into like standup comedy, Chinese standup comedy. And I was like, wow, they have that now. That's like a more recent development, I think, within China itself. Yeah. Like otherwise, just like random day to day or maybe even like childhood interests. I wouldn't really know. I think there's also even I'm like, maybe this is too deep. But when I was playing that parents are human game with them, I learned a lot of stuff that
[00:36:21.130] was like kind of traumatic. Like, I don't remember what the question was. I think it was something about sibling dynamics or something. And I learned that some like trauma that both my parents respectively had around siblings like passing away when they were younger. And I was like, I didn't even know you had this sibling. And they're like, yeah, why would we talk about it? I think back to the cultural aspect, right? So much of the harder stuff to talk about.
[00:36:47.910] A lot of times they just don't share because they're like, we don't talk about that stuff. That's just how the culture is. But that's important. That seems like it's pretty important and probably like shaped how you think about, you know, your relationship with your family and how much time we should be spending together and all that. And so it's very interesting when we try to bridge with our Western and a lot of like, I don't know, self-growth therapy stuff that we work on, like to their very Eastern and kind
[00:37:17.790] of like keep it to yourself way of thinking a lot of times. So I do think there's just so much where it's like, you never know until you ask. And onus is on us to ask, I think. Like, and I think to an extent, I mean, I think fully our parents also realize this and also feel the gap and also understand the cultural divide is what I'm thinking. I had a conversation with my mom where I was like, you know, I've been going to therapy recently. It's life changing. It's really helped me, blah, blah. And she was like, oh my God, good for you. That sounds great.
[00:37:47.610] Like so worth the investment, like blah, blah, like really hyping me up to go. And then I was like, oh yeah, like maybe you and dad should try sometime. Like it's really cool. And then she was like, no, we're good. Like we don't want to air out our like shit. And I was like, oh, okay. You just said it was really good for me, but that's cool. I guess. Yeah. Your parents are already at least more Western than my parents. My mom was like, oh, why are you going to see a therapist? Are you crazy or something? I'm like, oh, cool. Cool. Good talk. Yeah.
[00:38:19.110] Yeah. I think I've actually explained therapy to my mom once or twice before. And she was just like, cool, dot, dot, dot. But then I like kind of went into it and like explained. I was like, yeah, you know, if I feel like there's issues that I need to like talk about or ask someone for help with like how to think about this, how to get over it, or even in like relationships with like friends, parents, romantic relationships, you know, it's a resource, blah, blah, blah. My mom was like, yeah, I guess it sounds not bad.
[00:38:48.590] And then that's like the conversation just ends there. I'm like, oh, cool. At least she listened. I think my parents get it now, but I do think something I realized was, I don't know if your parents do the same thing, but my parents used like me and my brother as their therapists. So I think I tried to explain it to them that way once where I was like, you know how you
[00:39:12.530] just like shit on dad when you guys are fighting to like me or my brother and you like expect us to listen and like give you advice and stuff. It's kind of like that, but with a stranger who's not invested in like the drama. Oh my God. Relatable. That's so funny. Did your parents, were they like, oh, you know, that sounds kind of good. No, they were like, they were like, oh, I mean, I guess that makes sense, but they still
[00:39:42.110] are so Eastern in that mindset where they're like, oh, why would you air your baggage to a stranger? Yeah. Yeah. Like that's for your family to deal with. I'm like, that's not healthy, but they're actually your friend. You just give them money. They're like, but you're free. Yeah, exactly. To tie it back to like what you were saying earlier, the vibe I get is like my parents just want to move on.
[00:40:09.690] They don't want to like hang back and do a breakdown of what just happened. It's kind of like, okay, well that sucks. Like let's move on and look to the next thing. There's no point in like getting stuck in this. On one hand, that makes a lot of sense. But then on the other hand, it's like, I'm sure there's some lessons you could learn or maybe like insight you could gain from looking back on this. Maybe not, of course, like getting really stuck on it, but like, you know, just kind of breaking
[00:40:37.410] it down and being like, okay, next time if this were to happen again, I'm prepared. So I think it's like definitely pros and cons. If you go all in on one way, it's not going to be that helpful. And if you go all in on the other way, that's also probably not going to be the most helpful either. Yeah, I feel like this is why I'm so excited to have kids of my own because I don't know if either of you guys follow Alex Earl, but she's like the new generations, it girl, like TikTok famous.
[00:41:06.070] And she is very close to her parents. They go partying, they go like clubbing together. And that's not necessarily the relationship that I want with my kids. But that's something where I'm like, damn, if you're like from the same culture, age gap isn't that big, don't have a language barrier, even if it's a small one. That's the kind of relationship that you can have. And I want to have a relationship with my kids where they're close to my friends, you know,
[00:41:32.890] and they can like joke around and like have really open and honest conversations with us about being a teenager or like growing up instead of a lot of it going unsaid where you're just like, I don't even want to like bother explaining this. Like they won't get it. They didn't grow up here or whatever. I think there's just a lot more shared experience that can happen. And I am beyond grateful for the relationship that I have with my parents, but I just feel like there's a different path out there too that I also want to experience. For sure.
[00:42:00.690] I don't think my husband has the same relationship where he'll go clubbing with his parents. But when I first saw them talk over dinner, I was like, wow, you guys are really close. Like he calls them by their first name. I'm like, oh my God. The disrespect, you know? I was like, what is this? But no, it's very like endearing. And I noticed he and his brother always make fun of their mom, but in a, you know, lighthearted way.
[00:42:29.970] And I was like, this is such a different dynamic than like my parents and us. So, so much of it, I think is also like the culture you want to build within your family. Cause even if you speak the same language, it's not like every, for example, like every rando white American family is like tight just because they all speak English and they might be closer in age. We don't know. Everyone's different. Right. I think it's what you want to build out of it, but I do agree.
[00:42:55.730] There's so much, if you really did grow up in the same environment or had the same shared experiences as like kids, there's more that you can relate on, but it's really, I think up to you on how you build that family culture. And going back to us with our parents, I think I'm trying to like change our family culture. I'm like, let's like be a little closer. I'm like share a little more than we used to. Yeah.
[00:43:22.890] I think it's a lot when you think about it, we're not only bridging the gap between us generation wise, but there's the language and the culture, like all the things that we've mentioned. And so you're so right. Jisoo, if we were to have children, unless we move to like a brand new country with a different language again, but I feel like there's a lot less to bridge the gap for. And then you can just focus on the one or two like differences that we're trying to like
[00:43:52.810] reach over to build that relationship with. So right now our relationship building with family is on hard mode. And hopefully that means that in the future it becomes easier and easier. Agreed. The culture aspect actually is a big part of the really Mandarin stuff. So we've thus far talked a lot about where we feel a little bit restricted in our language
[00:44:19.330] when we try to talk to, for example, like adult cousins back in Asia and whatever. But I think a lot of times also with language, people think about where's the gap between me and a native speaker. So if it's Chinese, it'd be like, where's the gap between me and someone in China or me and someone in Taiwan and someone in Korea. Right. But we did grow up so different from those people that there's a big part of our personalities, a big part of our experiences that are tied to being Western.
[00:44:49.150] So I'd say a third of the existing course in really Mandarin is based on talking about the cultural difference stuff. Some of it is kind of applicable regardless of where you grew up, if you're just talking about the news or whatever. But even like dating is different, right? Because West is a lot more casual and confusing, I think, than standard Asian wholesome dating styles.
[00:45:17.270] Also things that are only things we would understand. So even when I was building the course with my Taiwan based Mandarin teacher partner, I have the section around like being a minority in a majority society or like media representation. And she did the translation stuff and I would look at it. I'm like, that's not what I meant. I'm just like, so what did you mean? I'm like, well, when you are like the only one in the class that looks like this or whatever,
[00:45:44.010] you know, I had to explain what that actual experience is because they don't have that experience. It's like impossible for them to know what that experience is because that's something they'd only know if they grew up here. So a big part of the course content is around like, how do you give words to that experience that only you could have? Because I think I get frustrated sometimes when people that are native are like, oh, you want to improve your Mandarin?
[00:46:11.030] Just like watch a bunch of Chinese shows and you'll become fluent. I'm like, I guess, but then I'm going to sound super haony, super Chinese. And like, that still doesn't give me the words for when I'm talking about a fight I had today with a coworker or whatever, because it's so contextual to growing up here. And also culturally, we're much more, I don't know if you think about this a lot, but we're a lot more straightforward in the West. We're like kind of blunt sometimes with how we talk versus in a lot of Asian languages,
[00:46:39.530] it's a lot more buffered. Like you find a nicer way to say things. You're going to like talk around something. I've also found where I'm trying to say something and they're like, whoa, did you mean to say it like that? Because it sounded really harsh. I'm like, oh, it didn't sound harsh in my head because in English, it wouldn't have been that way. So I think something a lot of people don't think about is like how much culture plays into language and how you would actually express something.
[00:47:06.990] So we try to tackle a big part of that with really Mandarin. That makes a lot of sense. And you're so right about the cultural impact of how we speak as well, because especially when you're saying like how in Western culture, we're a little more blunt. And I'm sure a lot of people are similar to this, where if you have a second language, you're usually trying to like translate your English sentence into that other language.
[00:47:34.070] And then you like say it out, especially more like complex sentences. And so then it maybe when you say it, the person who is listening is like that low key makes no sense in the context of this language. Like, what are you saying? And you're like, no, that's just how we say it in English. And they're like, that's maybe this one idiom or like this one phrase you tried to say it like doesn't exist or that that's just like words stitched together that you just said. So I feel like that's so true.
[00:48:03.410] Well, there's definitely some that are similar because I think I was talking to my mom about how to say something's really popular. How do you say that in Chinese? And she was like, oh, well, one of the like more slang ways to say this is just to say something is like fire, literally. And I was like, oh my God, that's how we say it in English. She was like, that's crazy. But there's definitely also ones that are like completely different where I was like, oh, we kind of say it this way and like more colloquial or like slang way in English. And she was like, yeah, you can't say that in Chinese.
[00:48:34.590] So I feel like that's definitely helpful to have more insight in the cultural way and like colloquial way that people say stuff. The other thing that randomly came to mind is I find that I if I really sit down and think about the way that I perceive or like describe something, I feel like I call upon things that are very relevant in like US culture. So like sometimes I'll see something and be like, oh, this is like sorority vibes or like, oh, this is just like science camp or, you know, things that we're so used to.
[00:49:03.910] And sometimes I notice my parents do the same thing. But for their Korean lived experience, they'll say, oh, this looks like a Sujeonhue or whatever. And I just remember having these conversations with my parents where I was like sitting down trying to explain what a sorority was. I was like, oh, it's kind of like this club, but it's all girls. I'm like you pay and, you know, you do these things and they're just like, what? So I don't know, like a lot of even these small things in our daily interactions can feel
[00:49:31.390] like not divisive, but just like another reminder of like, oh, we like grew up differently. So I wonder if having more of that like shared vocabulary or even like the methodology and like the words to describe these differences would aid a lot in these conversations as well. Wait, that's so funny that you brought up the sorority thing, because I had that experience in college where I was trying to explain to my parents. I was like, oh, yeah, I joined this like club.
[00:49:56.850] And then the good thing was that one of my family friends did like a fraternity. So I was like, yeah, it's just like what this family friend did, except ours is like both boys and girls. And I have like a big and she's like, oh, OK, so like you have like a big sister kind of thing. And I was like, yeah, pretty much. And we just left it at that. That's pretty close. I was like, thank God someone already explained it for me.
[00:50:25.150] And I just have to tag on to it. Well, this has been such an insightful conversation. I don't think I've ever realized how many gaps and like voids there are in my Korean vocabulary. So this is definitely a signal for me to sit down and read some words in the dictionary. But thank you, Angela, so much for joining us today.
