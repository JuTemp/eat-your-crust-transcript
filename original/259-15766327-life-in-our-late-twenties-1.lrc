[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo
[00:00:04.360] And I'm Jimmy
[00:00:16.250] Welcome back Jimmy the last time you were on the podcast was episode
[00:00:20.430] 2018 and 2019 which was a two-parter about breakups
[00:00:25.810] Which I think was very fun to record episode and also fun to listen to episode
[00:00:31.310] So today we're really excited to have Jimmy back because we have a topic that I feel like might be relevant for a lot of our listeners
[00:00:38.290] Which is life in our late twenties
[00:00:41.370] Crystal and I talk often about how our age and changes in our age affect our lifestyle and our values and really just the way we look at life
[00:00:51.910] So today we wanted to kind of dive into that
[00:00:55.030] So let's kick this off by talking about how our lifestyle has changed over the years in our twenties
[00:01:02.190] Do you think life right now looks really different from life when we were 22-23?
[00:01:07.750] Fuck yeah it does
[00:01:09.510] The listeners can't really see but I got some nice decor now
[00:01:14.090] My walls and everything
[00:01:15.430] But I'm a grown-ass adult
[00:01:17.730] I got like a nice hobby
[00:01:19.570] And stuff you know that I spend a lot of time with
[00:01:23.190] I'm a whiteboard with
[00:01:24.450] Oh it used to have all my errands on it but I'm a grown-ass adult so I've done the ball
[00:01:30.130] I think early twenties is for sure just like a developmental phase of your life
[00:01:36.450] Where you're just trying to figure out how to do basic shit the kids call it like adulting
[00:01:42.490] Right so you try learning how to adult in all that
[00:01:45.730] Winger what it's just like you prefer a clean house, you prefer your sleep, you prefer
[00:01:51.750] Making sure you're alright individually
[00:01:53.930] Whereas when I was a rump, I was just as early twenties dude
[00:01:59.110] I did not take care of myself
[00:02:01.910] Oh you guys know you guys been in my house
[00:02:03.770] I lived with all dudes
[00:02:05.270] We wouldn't do the dishes until like fucking mold started growing on
[00:02:09.550] It was disgusting
[00:02:13.430] We'd have like you know full-ass trash bags
[00:02:16.210] Just leave it at the door because people are too lazy to take it out
[00:02:19.410] Dude
[00:02:20.890] Just disgusting man
[00:02:22.030] And then we would smoke weed like all day
[00:02:26.290] But times have changed
[00:02:27.750] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:02:29.870] I always smoke weed all night
[00:02:33.950] There are elements, bits and pieces of that
[00:02:36.030] But I could definitely relate to
[00:02:37.650] But I feel like one of the biggest things that I can point to is
[00:02:41.890] I almost feel like it took me the last eight years to realize what the consequences of certain actions are
[00:02:47.850] So if in my early twenties everything came to me as a surprise
[00:02:51.610] Like oh why am I so tired without me thinking oh it's because I sleep at 2 a.m every day
[00:02:56.870] But now I feel like I'm very conscious of it
[00:02:59.370] And that doesn't necessarily mean I'm always good at keeping up a routine or structure that benefits me
[00:03:05.170] But at least I know I can't be doing X, Y and Z without expecting to have ABC happen the next day
[00:03:13.050] So that has been a huge change for me
[00:03:16.090] Yeah, and I think our body just changes to in college and high school
[00:03:21.450] Pulling an ulnar was not really a big deal
[00:03:24.230] Your little tire the next day but you can recover pretty quickly
[00:03:27.050] But now I can definitely feel like if I were to pull an ulnar I need at least like two days to recover
[00:03:32.970] Oh my god, yeah
[00:03:35.170] So I have a thing I have done this my entire life where when I have a red eye flight
[00:03:39.750] I will always pull all nighter the night before so I could pass out
[00:03:45.350] Not the entire flight right recently actually last weekend
[00:03:49.030] I went to Turks for my friends wedding and I did all nighter
[00:03:53.850] I had the red eye but I went on it the fucking flight attendant
[00:03:58.750] I don't know why I had a empty middle seat I was the IOC
[00:04:02.770] This flight attendant kept waking me up to sit in the middle seat
[00:04:06.210] Oh my god
[00:04:07.950] Right and it looks like literally every three minutes and not just like a gentle like excuse me
[00:04:13.830] Can I get back?
[00:04:14.630] It's like a aggressive dash shake on my shoulder
[00:04:18.210] Vice group on my shoulder like excuse me I need to get through
[00:04:21.770] What the fuck is going on?
[00:04:23.750] I thought they provided facilities for these five and ten days
[00:04:26.910] God damn and not only that too she wasn't sleeping when she sat in the middle seat
[00:04:32.410] She was legit like eating chips and shit like rustling bags or whatnot
[00:04:37.230] God damn
[00:04:39.090] But I was like I had pulled all nighter before so I wasn't coherent
[00:04:44.430] I wasn't able to form words and speak my mind
[00:04:47.670] I just fucking took it
[00:04:50.370] You know I didn't I didn't go no stop. I don't like it
[00:04:56.170] You let her bully you. I let her bully me. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry
[00:05:03.550] The one time I kidded because the tree was down and I was resting on the tree
[00:05:08.190] And so I was trying to put up the tree so that she could get through
[00:05:11.330] And she was like don't know what I'm worried about it. She fucking slams the tree
[00:05:15.290] And just bodies her way through
[00:05:17.750] Oh my god
[00:05:19.050] Dude and we're far too. She fucking and command deers the armrest too
[00:05:25.070] Oh no, yeah
[00:05:27.050] Wait that's actually crazy. I thought they usually saved seats in the back for flight attendants
[00:05:32.690] Right I thought so too. Oh no man
[00:05:35.430] I told us to other people and they're like oh dude maybe she has a crush on you
[00:05:38.850] But it's like there's no way because she aggressively just located my shoulder every time she went down through
[00:05:49.550] God I went through two nights without sleeping and when I got to Turks like I kid you not
[00:05:57.010] I had a sleep for like two days straight
[00:05:59.550] Oh my god
[00:06:00.170] Like legit I'd wake up eat lunch with the group go back to my room sleep until dinner time eat there
[00:06:06.970] And then go back to sleep until like fucking you know seven eight eight eight and stuff
[00:06:12.210] Yeah, so I can't handle all night or zamor
[00:06:15.250] But going back to your point G-soo
[00:06:18.470] I also learned that if I exercise slash like workout in the morning
[00:06:23.710] That it just significantly gives me a lot more energy throughout the day and stuff
[00:06:28.770] And so that's why I started doing as well when I was there, you know
[00:06:31.530] When you say when we're in our late 20s you figure out like strategies instead which your body needs
[00:06:36.890] Yeah definitely
[00:06:37.890] And sometimes even like really simple stuff to like drinking water all start to feel like shit at like one p.m.
[00:06:44.490] And then I realized I didn't choke water all day and I was like oh my god, I'm going to up my intake
[00:06:49.190] And like maintain all of this stuff like this is crazy
[00:06:52.330] Yeah, I'm a little embarrassed to say but that's like a fucking recent revelation for me
[00:06:57.610] You know like one p.m. 2 p.m. comes around and I'm like why am I so fucking tired
[00:07:03.150] And I realized it's because I've only been drinking coffee
[00:07:06.430] You know that was my liquid intake
[00:07:09.290] But then once I started drinking like hell of water
[00:07:11.830] Yeah, I've been able to like not take it to our adapt during work
[00:07:17.290] Shit the ice
[00:07:19.370] I'm like looking I work from home
[00:07:21.710] So I'm looking at my couch like off
[00:07:24.510] Dude yeah and coffee is dehydrating
[00:07:26.950] I think we often forget that like caffeine is dehydrating in general
[00:07:31.570] So it's like oh I'm awake for the next you know a couple hours and they're like okay now
[00:07:36.570] I'm like crashing and I'm like feeling weird
[00:07:39.510] And all I needed was some water
[00:07:41.890] You feel like it's surprising you know when you don't know about it
[00:07:45.650] But you know I drink my fucking triple espresso in the morning
[00:07:48.270] I can't speak up don't drink any water
[00:07:50.950] That I won't be able to win on tired
[00:07:52.610] I'm like what the fuck is going on?
[00:07:54.850] Usually like that
[00:07:57.290] You're like trust me when I was 21
[00:07:59.110] I'd be powering through the day
[00:08:01.790] Yeah
[00:08:02.330] Well yeah so a lot of things change and you realize that your body needs a lot of upkeep
[00:08:08.250] And you find strategies so like you know make it work and stuff
[00:08:11.810] I fucking stretch now
[00:08:13.510] You know my god
[00:08:14.810] I know right before you should make fun of people
[00:08:17.430] Are you saying for my housemates
[00:08:19.630] This is so my previous housemates were like I think seven years older than me
[00:08:24.310] So when I was 25 they're like 32 and stuff
[00:08:27.350] And they stretched before like this is my activity and everything
[00:08:30.070] I'm like fucking old ass people
[00:08:33.690] I need to do it just take it you know
[00:08:37.390] Now it's like you're hearing stories about your friends
[00:08:41.490] Where they're hearing their Achilles and stuff
[00:08:44.150] Right true
[00:08:45.330] My friend Mikey
[00:08:46.690] It was so sad we were playing a pickleball like a public park
[00:08:50.970] And then because it's so popular you got to wait like 30 minutes until you get into a game
[00:08:55.590] 30 minutes and he didn't stretch at all
[00:08:58.090] He finally gets into a game
[00:08:59.750] Literally the first hit he does
[00:09:02.670] He pairs his Achilles
[00:09:03.970] Oh my god that's tragic
[00:09:05.650] I know
[00:09:07.230] And then wing as well in aes girl
[00:09:10.310] She pairs I think your Achilles or something
[00:09:12.710] They they she tore something
[00:09:14.130] Yeah
[00:09:14.730] Dude
[00:09:15.450] We're going to let age guys
[00:09:17.090] I know I feel like so much of life now is like prep work
[00:09:21.010] Honestly to me it boils down to like impulse control almost because if I had to describe it
[00:09:27.410] I think in my early 20s
[00:09:29.130] I live my life exactly how I wanted to
[00:09:32.410] The things that I did at any step of the day was because I wanted to do it
[00:09:37.270] Like I want to exercise or I want to do this
[00:09:39.630] But now it's not because I want to do it
[00:09:41.810] It's like I need it
[00:09:42.790] Like I know I need to exercise
[00:09:44.210] I don't need to sleep early etc etc
[00:09:46.890] And it's like training myself to do those things voluntarily
[00:09:51.850] You know
[00:09:53.050] It's crazy
[00:09:54.010] I now don't go get talk about at 2 a.m
[00:09:59.510] Dude because I see a lot of tick tops or something where people are like
[00:10:03.690] Oh my god, you know now I'm in my 30s or 40s
[00:10:07.490] And I can't just go out and eat junk food to feel better
[00:10:11.090] Because I'll feel like shit the next day
[00:10:13.210] Yeah
[00:10:13.790] I fear the day that happens to us
[00:10:18.290] And at work
[00:10:19.430] My co-workers were talking to each other
[00:10:21.290] Like what year did you really start to see your metabolism slow down
[00:10:25.890] And they all were like oh you know like 30 or like 34 or something like that
[00:10:30.270] And I was like oh it's kind of like coming up
[00:10:32.430] Like that's a little scary
[00:10:34.390] Yeah, I think it's coming up right now
[00:10:36.570] It's like I've been a skinny dude my entire life
[00:10:39.750] Last year
[00:10:40.790] I was just eating how I normally eat
[00:10:44.110] I gained fucking 15 pounds
[00:10:45.790] Wow
[00:10:46.370] Yeah, yeah
[00:10:48.430] Oh my god the fuck do you shit ever
[00:10:50.590] Because I know I was getting fat
[00:10:53.450] When I could start seeing my cheeks in my peripherals
[00:10:56.870] Oh my god
[00:10:57.930] That's crazy
[00:10:59.390] Oh my god
[00:11:01.930] You're like what is that
[00:11:04.230] Oh my god
[00:11:05.930] Oh I can see my cheeks
[00:11:08.270] Oh my god
[00:11:11.950] And like pictures dude like my friends was like
[00:11:14.890] Take pictures from me from the side profile
[00:11:16.990] And I got a protruding head down here
[00:11:21.570] There were signs
[00:11:23.210] Yeah
[00:11:24.090] You know okay anger on my friends
[00:11:25.970] Like how can you guys do tell me this stuff
[00:11:29.850] Oh my god speaking of though
[00:11:31.730] I realized I was like because some days I work from home
[00:11:35.230] And so some of these days
[00:11:36.730] I'm just like not getting steps in
[00:11:38.450] I'm like not really moving
[00:11:39.730] So I literally bought a walking pad to use
[00:11:42.910] To make sure that on those like sedentary days
[00:11:46.070] I can hop on the walking pad
[00:11:47.910] And get hopefully around 10,000 steps in
[00:11:51.370] What's a walking pad
[00:11:52.570] It's a mini treadmill
[00:11:54.370] That only goes up to about three miles per hour and speed
[00:11:58.330] And there's no like handle bar you hold onto
[00:12:00.610] So you can just kind of like tuck it under your couch
[00:12:03.670] And like pull it out to like walk on it
[00:12:05.950] Why don't you just go outside
[00:12:07.150] Dude
[00:12:09.070] It's an efficient use of time
[00:12:11.150] Because I can just if I'm doing things like watching TV
[00:12:15.030] Or like working I could use it
[00:12:18.410] I understand now
[00:12:21.150] I thought you're just like freaking
[00:12:24.070] Correntining at oh no
[00:12:25.630] Don't want to leave at all
[00:12:27.590] There's no way I would just walk and stare at a wall
[00:12:31.990] You're a crystal I thought it was facing like a corner of the wall
[00:12:36.230] Do you know about your whole dark industry?
[00:12:40.010] No, I just walk on it when I watch TV
[00:12:42.450] Which is super good because I can easily walk for like two three hours
[00:12:46.430] If you watch like put on a movie and that's like 10 to 15k
[00:12:50.370] You've done that?
[00:12:51.690] You've walked throughout an entire movie?
[00:12:53.990] Yeah, yeah
[00:12:54.730] That's pretty crazy
[00:12:55.310] That's impressive
[00:12:56.110] I don't know if I could do that
[00:12:57.990] My crystal is stocks just went way
[00:13:00.730] Thank you, thank you
[00:13:03.290] You converted a hater
[00:13:05.930] But I guess aside from lifestyle changes right
[00:13:09.430] I feel like that kind of stuff is almost
[00:13:11.250] Small decisions that you make on the daily
[00:13:13.710] But I think there are also probably some bigger like key decisions that we have made over the last few years
[00:13:19.690] To really inspire the changes or push ourselves forward as we age
[00:13:24.230] So can you think of any like major conscious decisions that you made?
[00:13:28.450] I think honestly it's like a mix of the two key conscious decisions things that jump into mind
[00:13:34.830] You know, I have a lot of uh
[00:13:36.830] Vices. I'll just leave it at that
[00:13:38.850] I got a lot of vices that I've had to consciously be aware of sometimes is called Turkey
[00:13:45.850] I think the uh safer work
[00:13:48.890] Example would be like honesty girls. I just re-addicted two girls
[00:13:53.050] I guess
[00:13:54.450] I guess
[00:13:56.210] Shout out Eddie now
[00:14:00.850] Before when I was like
[00:14:03.390] 25 where guess my entire life up until 25
[00:14:07.230] The 25 was like the key pivotal time when I was like on-hinge
[00:14:11.330] And I would be you know, dang girls constantly always looking for the next one
[00:14:16.570] But then that's something that you know, I had to make a conscious decision about that
[00:14:21.130] Okay, this is honestly pretty negative right?
[00:14:24.290] You start from empty inside. You start feeling very just like what am I doing in my life
[00:14:28.950] Like this is now like my life purpose
[00:14:31.510] At the same time too, it was meant right?
[00:14:35.290] And that was incredibly fun as a job
[00:14:38.550] But then just like with the girl thing I start feeling a little empty inside
[00:14:43.170] Because you're so sort of like selling your soul right you're selling your personality for money
[00:14:47.490] As I say anything where girls two where you're starting to just like make adaptations to your personality
[00:14:52.930] You're mooring it in a way where you know, it'll fit different types of personalities
[00:14:59.410] It'll fit different types of people
[00:15:02.150] And so that was the key decision I made around like okay I quit my job as a salesman
[00:15:08.170] And then I I deleted it and it was really good for me in the long run
[00:15:12.910] Because then it was more you know, I'm doing stuff for myself
[00:15:16.210] And I'm staying true to my personality
[00:15:17.870] And I'm not changing it
[00:15:19.990] Like you got to grow into your own personality more
[00:15:24.510] Mm-hmm, exactly exactly
[00:15:26.530] And so I think that was those of really big key conscious decision I made
[00:15:31.390] I guess the biggest one was last December
[00:15:34.630] I adopted a dog
[00:15:36.930] Rhyla you guys don't wrap it
[00:15:39.350] A little puppy
[00:15:40.190] She's my everything now
[00:15:41.970] But yeah, that was a big decision I made
[00:15:45.470] I did most of the because I grew up with dogs and so I just missed having a dog around
[00:15:50.010] But once I got her it made me
[00:15:53.330] I don't know, it just sold me down like immediately
[00:15:56.190] Well you guys know this I'm a I'm a party person
[00:15:59.890] I'm like going to parties. I used to like every weekend
[00:16:02.590] I would have something Friday afternoon
[00:16:05.130] And then someone's birthday Friday night
[00:16:08.210] And then Saturday you know, I do like a morning hike with someone
[00:16:11.910] And then I would go and you know go to a day party
[00:16:15.470] Someone's birthday. So many birthdays in the year
[00:16:17.910] Go to a day party and then go to a night party
[00:16:20.830] And then go to a afters afterwards
[00:16:22.570] Get home like fucking for a yeah
[00:16:24.590] And then just like repeat and rinse right, rinse and repeat
[00:16:29.030] Now I have the dog, I don't do that anymore
[00:16:31.770] And so now I'm way more conscious of who I hang out with
[00:16:35.130] And how I spend my time
[00:16:36.530] I'll go to like two birthdays every weekend
[00:16:40.090] Even though that's still a lot but it's not a lot
[00:16:43.450] It's still a lot but it's not like I'm there from like 6 p.m.
[00:16:48.850] 6 a.m. you know, I'm not hearing the birds chirping anymore
[00:16:51.650] I'm not hearing morning joggers
[00:16:53.910] It's still dark when you get home
[00:16:55.890] Yeah, it's still dark when I get home
[00:16:59.010] And it's still very much like okay if I if I get home
[00:17:03.070] Out like two a.m. then I'll be able to get some sleep wake up at
[00:17:07.950] It a.m. just so I can walk right take her out
[00:17:11.890] Feed her even though she refuses either food now
[00:17:15.330] Feed her and just makes her she's all right
[00:17:18.150] So I think just having that extra responsibility of having a dog
[00:17:21.790] It's really it's really changed me because it's just like so
[00:17:25.710] It made me down a lot more and it's made me
[00:17:29.250] I don't know I grew up the youngest kid in my family
[00:17:32.570] So I was very much just the child you know my entire life
[00:17:36.030] I was I was a youngest not only sibling but youngest cousin
[00:17:39.750] My entire family you know so I was just the baby of the family
[00:17:42.670] I never had to like take care of anyone
[00:17:44.670] I very high take care of myself
[00:17:46.570] Take care of me
[00:17:48.350] So I got a dog like complete like flip the script
[00:17:51.590] We're now I'm taking care of another moving thing
[00:17:54.390] And so now I'm not thinking too much of myself anymore
[00:17:57.710] You know I'm thinking more of like her well being and that's like paramount to me
[00:18:02.710] And luckily it also helps you
[00:18:05.710] Yeah, yeah, like it's really built healthy habits
[00:18:09.050] I mean you guys would probably me right
[00:18:10.770] Like I went to my friends B-day yesterday
[00:18:14.010] And I came home at 12 a.m.
[00:18:15.710] Dude impressive
[00:18:17.170] So that's a lot
[00:18:21.030] It's pretty good. It's pretty good
[00:18:22.730] So yeah, no it's just maybe more responsible
[00:18:25.930] And I guess a better functioning citizen of society
[00:18:30.010] You're like damn if I don't go home for myself
[00:18:33.110] Rhyla is waiting for me at home
[00:18:35.230] Like I need to go home for her
[00:18:37.310] True
[00:18:37.650] Oh yeah, well it's not just that too
[00:18:39.370] It's like I'm excited to go home you know
[00:18:41.990] Walk to the door
[00:18:42.950] She wakes up like
[00:18:45.570] And like
[00:18:46.610] Baby
[00:18:49.310] And then if I'm still drunk I'll lay it down on the floor
[00:18:52.410] And just have her like run all over me
[00:18:54.330] And that's the thing ever
[00:18:56.430] I feel like this is what makes me very excited to have kids
[00:19:00.450] Because the responsibility of having someone to take care of is huge
[00:19:05.710] And I feel like I'm someone who
[00:19:08.110] Enjoys kind of having that responsibility sometimes
[00:19:10.410] Or maybe also much enjoy
[00:19:12.070] But I think I could be like a bigger person
[00:19:15.670] If I had something to take care of
[00:19:17.510] Like it would bring out more from within me
[00:19:20.490] So I'm just like super excited to have kids
[00:19:23.650] And you know things like that are big
[00:19:25.310] Conscious decisions right?
[00:19:26.650] Like you said Crystal, usually beneficial for both you and
[00:19:30.110] Whatever you're taking care of
[00:19:33.670] Hopefully
[00:19:35.110] Right
[00:19:36.370] Maybe it's a longer term thing for kids
[00:19:40.270] That's true
[00:19:41.350] Well I think so too because it's just like
[00:19:43.550] I think especially dogs and kids
[00:19:45.790] They were flexion of you
[00:19:47.510] So if you're doggy shitty
[00:19:49.750] Like there'll be you know shitty dogs at the dog park
[00:19:52.830] You'll be like that owner doesn't have their shit together
[00:19:56.690] You know like their owner isn't really doing as much as they can
[00:20:01.650] Like my friend right now is trying to adopt a puppy
[00:20:04.110] And then and so she's like spent time with just like getting to know it
[00:20:08.290] And then she texted both me and my friend who I'm dogs
[00:20:10.570] And she's like honestly I realize you guys are actually like
[00:20:13.610] Great parents
[00:20:14.870] Your dogs are so well behaved
[00:20:17.690] They're not like bark and everything
[00:20:19.410] They're not growling on anything
[00:20:21.070] And it's just like a total reflection
[00:20:22.950] And you you feel proud
[00:20:24.910] Yeah, I feel more proud when people compliment
[00:20:27.330] Rather than I do if people compliment me
[00:20:30.110] Oh
[00:20:31.510] That's so cute
[00:20:32.970] Yeah, I feel like you're right
[00:20:34.350] It's definitely a good exercise
[00:20:36.560] You're truly learning to take care of something else
[00:20:39.270] Especially if you get a dog when they're like a puppy
[00:20:42.510] So you're like the biggest influence on their life
[00:20:45.950] Yeah, yeah exactly
[00:20:47.510] I think it's really much just like you have to sacrifice a lot
[00:20:51.750] You've sacrificed a lot of not just your time
[00:20:54.450] But your own self
[00:20:56.710] It's like an exchange where you're sacrificing
[00:20:59.050] You know what made you happy as an individual
[00:21:02.450] And now you know the thing you're taking care of
[00:21:06.530] is honestly a main source of your happiness
[00:21:09.490] Yeah
[00:21:09.970] And you're fine with it
[00:21:11.370] It's not like doom and gloom
[00:21:12.830] It's like you like it that way
[00:21:15.190] Right
[00:21:15.750] Yeah, and I feel like it just like expands your world view
[00:21:19.510] Almost because it's kind of like
[00:21:21.410] You know when you don't have guests over
[00:21:23.510] It's okay if your house is a little messy
[00:21:25.270] But then when you know people are coming over
[00:21:27.870] You like clean the house
[00:21:29.030] Because you're okay with like a little bit of mess
[00:21:30.970] But you don't want guests having to deal with that or whatever
[00:21:33.910] I feel like it's almost the same thing too
[00:21:36.010] It's like I can be satisfied with my own life
[00:21:38.770] Out like a certain bar
[00:21:40.090] But for my kids life
[00:21:41.470] Like I want them to have so much more
[00:21:43.610] And like so much access to stuff
[00:21:45.230] So then at a certain point
[00:21:46.790] It's just like they're able to expand your world
[00:21:50.130] As much as you are working to like expand theirs
[00:21:53.190] It's basically just upkeep right
[00:21:55.310] Before Rala
[00:21:56.590] I didn't go for walks
[00:21:58.630] You know
[00:21:59.170] I'm not a problem patty there
[00:22:00.810] Did you need a walking fan?
[00:22:04.390] I should probably just leash Rala onto the walk guide
[00:22:08.090] That's not sufficient
[00:22:10.050] But yeah
[00:22:10.770] It's very much like forces you to just do stuff
[00:22:14.730] That are honestly inherently healthy
[00:22:16.670] But you don't really do it because it's just you
[00:22:18.810] You have a lower standard for yourself
[00:22:21.210] They do for someone that's dependent on you
[00:22:23.790] So now I tear on our long walks
[00:22:26.590] I tear it to the dog park
[00:22:28.090] Because I want to just start being social with dogs and stuff
[00:22:31.190] It's cute too because I've taken Rala to the dog park every day
[00:22:35.910] The regular is there
[00:22:37.150] They always come up to me and they're like
[00:22:39.070] Oh I see the progress that Rala is making
[00:22:41.270] She's game more social you know
[00:22:43.490] She's not to intimidate anymore
[00:22:46.670] But big dogs and stuff
[00:22:48.690] And so it's and you hear that you're like
[00:22:50.490] You know right so you're doing good job
[00:22:53.690] She's she's growing as a dog too
[00:22:56.990] And her personality started shining out
[00:22:59.650] Yeah you used to become more proud
[00:23:01.650] Oh my god she made such a happy dad
[00:23:04.590] I know I'm not a dog dad
[00:23:07.110] Yeah right now she's in killing my bed
[00:23:10.230] Living life
[00:23:11.930] She barked it was like the first time I were two because it's all creator at night
[00:23:17.030] And she likes it like that you know
[00:23:18.430] She likes like her own little personal space
[00:23:20.510] So then I creator at night but then this morning
[00:23:23.550] Yes she heard me and my friend in my bedroom
[00:23:26.150] Then she she started barking
[00:23:27.850] I was like oh she never really barks you know
[00:23:30.530] I thought she needs like go pee go poop
[00:23:32.830] She don't want to go pee and poop
[00:23:33.910] She just ran straight to my bed like
[00:23:36.310] Let me yeah let me yeah
[00:23:37.690] She's jealous
[00:23:39.070] Yeah that's the right act
[00:23:41.990] She's just chilling there and like god dad
[00:23:44.610] Like I peaked over
[00:23:46.110] She's like down in her back
[00:23:48.370] She's like living life
[00:23:51.390] I do have a question though
[00:23:52.950] Because now that you have you know more responsibility
[00:23:55.850] Taking care of Rila
[00:23:57.690] And you've cut down a lot on your social activity
[00:24:02.070] How do you be more picky and cheesy with these hangouts
[00:24:05.570] Like what helps you determine you know which event you should be going
[00:24:10.070] To and which one you can probably forget about
[00:24:13.850] You know I don't know this is like two aggressive
[00:24:16.970] But you start having sort of like boundaries that you have
[00:24:24.890] Where it's like a you know black and white things like for instance
[00:24:28.450] I moved into my new place here right
[00:24:30.970] And I've been here for like a year maybe two years
[00:24:34.270] The friends that haven't made an effort to visit me
[00:24:38.670] I know a longer really like care to try and go with them and stuff
[00:24:43.270] And everything you know and so it sort of makes it easy like that
[00:24:47.470] Like the friends that flake they give like a larger penalty now
[00:24:50.870] You know and because I write a you know
[00:24:53.870] I can't I can't drive to SF all the time
[00:24:56.290] I can't do that so now I'm expecting you know my friends and SF
[00:25:00.290] To make the drive down here
[00:25:02.010] You know you be surprised
[00:25:03.710] And they do the trimming for you where the majority of them
[00:25:07.210] Haven't seen my new place have even seen Rala yet
[00:25:10.250] You know and they know that Rala is such a big part of my life
[00:25:13.690] This obviously you're living alone
[00:25:15.750] It's also a big like life changed for me
[00:25:18.710] So if you're a friend of mine and you do treat me care about me
[00:25:22.270] I think you would make an effort to come down here
[00:25:24.430] Right
[00:25:25.130] Yeah, so that's that's where my thinking is and it's very black and white where okay
[00:25:30.330] It's obvious if someone doesn't want to make the time for you and expects you to make time for them
[00:25:35.210] Then it's like it's uneven friendship and so those are like the social sort of events that I just don't really go to anymore
[00:25:44.530] Yeah, that makes sense. I feel like it really makes you in your perspective
[00:25:48.430] It's like okay, it's like your turn as my friend to reciprocate
[00:25:52.390] When like you've been putting in all this work previously to build up the friendship
[00:25:57.630] And then now you're like okay, I can kind of see people's like true colors I guess
[00:26:02.710] Or maybe they just haven't reached a level of maturity that you have so maybe in the future years they could come around
[00:26:10.450] Yeah, I know exactly. I mean it's I think before when you know single no dog
[00:26:17.070] I had like so much free time, you know always wanted to see oh what's the plan?
[00:26:21.910] What's the move for Friday? What's the move for Saturday and stuff? You realize you cater a lot to people
[00:26:28.830] And I'm an extravert too, so I don't think much of it at the time
[00:26:33.790] I don't like drive all the way to SF you know hot for one part of the other and stuff
[00:26:38.990] But now I don't have the means to cater to people
[00:26:42.550] So there's very much people that like reach out to me like hey I'm having this like I will really really love it for you to come
[00:26:50.230] And they were close friend my and then I'll come but then for the auxiliary friends that like invite me just to have
[00:26:57.950] I'd you know I sometimes think people like having me there because I'm I'm such a good aura
[00:27:04.570] I read actually very live for the party sort of or I think people used to invite me because of that
[00:27:10.730] And now it's very much like you know just trimming that away
[00:27:15.590] I always find it kind of fascinating to track what kind of role friendship plays in your life as you age
[00:27:22.510] Because you know we talk often about how friendship in our teenage years looks so different from friendship now
[00:27:29.190] And I do feel like as our lifestyle changes what we need and seek out of friendship also changes too
[00:27:35.590] And you know some of that might be like thinking about how you feel around certain friends
[00:27:41.690] or like how your life feels around certain friends and seeing the changes before and after them
[00:27:47.930] But some of that can also be like yeah I love and want to keep these friends but I might want to change the activities that I do with these friends
[00:27:55.510] So I feel like I have seen both in my life personally
[00:27:58.610] It's like sometimes you see friends come and go just because it might not be the best fit anymore at a certain age
[00:28:04.130] But other times the friends are the right people and you just switch up the activities
[00:28:07.690] Maybe do more sports or do more wholesome stuff and you enjoy that evolution as well
[00:28:17.390] So one of my really close friend groups my college friends right because their college friends our activities are very much not wholesome
[00:28:26.050] And you know I'm joy type of friends right
[00:28:31.350] I'm loving because every single time we're trying to make this with oh jesus you met them right and so you know you can speak to this
[00:28:38.850] Yeah, we try having a wholesome night so me and jesus and I cover my college friends
[00:28:44.330] We had a love island watch party for the reunion
[00:28:48.770] And I kid you not we're like okay, let's have it wholesome
[00:28:52.870] Maybe just get like a six pack right because there's like five of us. Let's just get a six pack and you know, we'll just have one drink each and that's it
[00:29:06.010] Not even we set out the dinner everyone seated down
[00:29:11.910] Not even one bite in one of my college friends goes
[00:29:16.810] Sh I
[00:29:19.710] And you know me I I fold under no pressure at all like a fucking lawn chair
[00:29:30.600] Oh, I ran my body. I ran the bottom of my hand. Let's do this
[00:29:34.960] It's pouring the shots. Yeah already
[00:29:37.540] That night was so funny right it was like oh there's only like a little bit in this bottle
[00:29:43.140] We might as well finish it and then it evolves into we didn't do this, but it did evolve into the question of
[00:29:49.440] Should we door dash something like should we
[00:29:56.300] We legit we're like ask oh what liquor stores around here
[00:30:01.000] I was like
[00:30:13.260] Shot stew you know, I'll leave it that way didn't just stop a shot
[00:30:18.300] Do ball on the right side. I remember GC re-counting this night to me. She was like oh my god
[00:30:22.880] I went over to Jimmy's to watch love island with him and his college friends
[00:30:26.480] And she was like wow Jimmy's place is like so nice. He really decorated
[00:30:30.980] It is truly a like nice bachelor of had essentially
[00:30:35.740] Boy, yeah, I was so struck by the like floating shelves with a plant and stuff
[00:30:41.820] I was like oh, how crystal like Jerry's face is amazing
[00:30:46.140] And I was like oh my god. We need to go again. I haven't seen it yet still in person
[00:30:51.940] You ever see it? I haven't seen your place in person yet. Yeah, cuz you didn't do a house for me
[00:30:57.740] True, but going back to my point right like true friends
[00:31:05.860] You're the exception, okay? You're the exception. Yeah, I'm just really bad
[00:31:13.040] Inviting people over for you know housewarming like setting something up as well
[00:31:18.080] That's just like not my nature. I'm very much
[00:31:22.040] Invite tea and not in a fighter
[00:31:25.640] The only time my place has usage is like for the afters, you know people go oh that's just going to Jimmy's after
[00:31:32.880] We'll just continue tonight there but it's never anything like oh that's going on my house
[00:31:38.940] Like the house for me
[00:31:43.200] But I do feel like Jimmy you're kind of the person who would be like if someone hit you up kind of last minute
[00:31:49.100] Like Harry free right now. Let's grab a beer and like wash the game together at your place
[00:31:53.240] You'd be like oh yeah, sure no one's done it yet, but yeah
[00:31:58.040] All right, it's on my to do list now
[00:32:01.800] Put it on the board the whiteboard
[00:32:05.260] Now that you guys are in our fancy football week now have people in the Bay Area that watch football
[00:32:13.360] So we will have wash parties. That's true. Yeah, and we have like at least three locations
[00:32:18.540] We could do it. Yeah, the relocations right here
[00:32:22.600] Us three
[00:32:26.120] Well, I do want to circle back to something that Jimmy said earlier
[00:32:30.000] Which I thought was interesting you said that 25 was a pretty pivotal year for you
[00:32:34.620] And I think honestly it was for me too and something that we discussed a lot on this podcast is like the concept of the frontal lobe
[00:32:43.880] Where you know 25 allegedly is when your frontal lobe is supposed to be fully developed
[00:32:49.800] So do you guys think that rings true to your experience when you look back at your age 25?
[00:32:57.500] Hopefully not
[00:32:59.860] Hopefully it's so developing
[00:33:03.640] You're like this can't be it
[00:33:06.880] This can't be it. It's got a much more development to do
[00:33:10.160] I do feel like there was a little bit of change though. I started realizing I cared more about consequences kind of like things scared me a little more if that makes sense
[00:33:22.460] It would be like, oh well, if I were to procrastinate on work
[00:33:26.080] I know the consequences of that like I'll have to work extra harder later and that's annoying right
[00:33:32.120] But then I feel like in my younger years I literally was like doing a homework five minutes before class started
[00:33:38.080] I'm like turning it in you know
[00:33:40.200] It's like whatever like I'm invincible like there's no consequences as long as I could have done
[00:33:46.120] But now it's like that could affect like my schedule my routine and that could just like knock over all these other aspects that I just like wouldn't have necessarily thought about what I was younger
[00:33:58.300] Yeah, I mean I think when I look back at age 25 life started to feel really real for me
[00:34:03.820] I was like everything that I do in every year now and on words it's going to be like something that I look back on when I'm like in my 40s or 50s I'll be like, oh man
[00:34:14.540] It could be something like, oh man, I wish I did this when I was 25 or I wish I did this you know
[00:34:19.740] So then I think I got really aware of like things that I might potentially regret not doing in a certain sense
[00:34:26.280] And also it was the year where I really wanted to start doing like building blocks on things that could set me up in the future
[00:34:35.840] Specifically just relationship wise for me and James
[00:34:38.600] I think that's when we started having pretty serious conversations about in the next five years what are the things we want to do on our checklist
[00:34:45.180] So yeah, maybe it's the combination of like the frontal lobe thing and also
[00:34:50.440] Just hitting that like mid 20s number
[00:34:53.840] But I think it was good like I think it was very developmental and it felt a little bit more serious
[00:34:59.760] Well, I went through all five 25
[00:35:03.900] I think
[00:35:05.820] With the ladies and the sales
[00:35:10.560] And just I think it's just getting right in developing healthy habits
[00:35:15.220] Like I speak more for for weed for example, even when I was a working man before a 25
[00:35:22.260] I would smoke weed all the time like legit hit a flinky
[00:35:28.220] I was a researcher before
[00:35:31.120] I would legit hit a flinky then you go back to the bench and start like pipetting shit
[00:35:36.880] And then like before sales calls
[00:35:39.600] I would do that too. I was a very high functioning smoker
[00:35:43.700] But then I realized like it's almost like a fucking rock lead taking off his ankle weights
[00:35:49.540] I stopped doing that and I'm like oh shit, I'm so much better my job now
[00:35:55.540] It's a lot growing is a lot of making responsible decisions
[00:35:59.520] Honestly to just stay in true to yourself and
[00:36:02.760] Honestly protecting your own self worth a lot more aggressively
[00:36:09.600] I thought one interesting thing I noticed as I turned 25 I guess actually was having more anxiety
[00:36:17.400] And I think it's because like somewhere subconsciously or consciously
[00:36:22.280] I was like realizing there's some danger in like some choices that I made potentially
[00:36:28.720] Or just like things that I was doing would like freak out my subconscious of it
[00:36:35.820] So I guess as an example sometimes I like take solo travel trips for the most part
[00:36:41.140] It's like fine, but I'm still like just a woman traveling alone
[00:36:45.480] And that's kind of like freaky in some aspects and it's like oh you need to stay pretty visually
[00:36:50.700] Like be aware of your surroundings and all of that kind of stuff
[00:36:53.860] So because I was like noticing more anxiety
[00:36:58.460] I had to look into like ways of managing my anxiety
[00:37:02.000] Whether that meant like doing things that made me feel more prepared or like doing things that were good for like mental health and wellness
[00:37:10.580] So I think like that was a trigger that made me focus a little more on like overall well being
[00:37:19.000] That's kind of interesting actually because I feel like for me
[00:37:23.000] I had the opposite experience where I started to experience a little bit less anxiety
[00:37:27.600] But maybe it's almost like life balancing out
[00:37:32.540] Because I was just so anxious like growing up
[00:37:36.120] But I started to give less of a shit about certain things
[00:37:40.500] Like I've had I used to care so much about what other people thought of me
[00:37:44.080] To where it was like distracting and just invasive as a thought
[00:37:48.280] And it's not to say that I don't care now because I definitely do care
[00:37:52.280] But maybe it's more at like a normal level and less as like a debilitating factor in life
[00:37:58.280] So I think for me it was also like a little bit of a positive change
[00:38:02.720] I can feel those thoughts of oh hopefully this person likes me but it doesn't have to be like all consuming
[00:38:09.840] Okay, what do you guys think of this?
[00:38:12.180] I feel like 25 mid to early 20s. It's almost like a second puberty
[00:38:16.920] Like you're really starting to grow into who I guess like close or tear final evolution
[00:38:24.740] And you go through a lot of potential changes or like re-evaluations of your life
[00:38:30.240] Because it's a big time of change
[00:38:33.980] Graduating college we're like getting our jobs
[00:38:36.700] Figuring out what we want to do with the rest of our life
[00:38:39.740] So I almost view this time as like a second puberty
[00:38:42.740] I think in that sense it's sort of like reverses some of the I guess negative stuff that came with your first puberty
[00:38:54.620] Right because the first puberty is when you started feeling more anxious about
[00:38:59.100] Oh, what do people care? You know like how do people see me you care a lot about it
[00:39:04.540] Just stuff that doesn't really matter
[00:39:06.780] And so in that sense this you know quote quote second puberty is sort of when you're reversing that
[00:39:13.320] It's like oh things like that don't actually matter and you start zeroing in other things that do matter to you
[00:39:21.760] Like fulfilling relationships family time
[00:39:26.600] Yeah, I don't know. I think you just started becoming more of a null really you know start selling it
[00:39:31.620] Second puberty in that sense
[00:39:34.000] I think one of the interesting things about being in my late twenties is I almost feel like I have two conflicting emotions going on
[00:39:42.000] Like half of me is so excited to be 30 because I feel like being 30 and being in your 30s onwards is first fall almost like a fresh start
[00:39:50.040] It's like you're starting your new decade with the bang
[00:39:53.420] But also at the same time like I'm so scared of hitting 30 or like leaving my 20s
[00:40:01.080] Happened me is just like waiting in anticipation like I'm just like waiting and like watching the countdown timer to 30
[00:40:06.980] And I just I don't know like I don't know how to deal with these conflicting emotions in a sense
[00:40:12.820] Like it almost feels like I'm in limbo while also trying to like live up the last few years of my 20s
[00:40:20.120] That makes sense. I'm on the opposite and I'm not trying to think about being 30
[00:40:25.920] It's not approaching. I don't want to think about it
[00:40:28.480] I think I'm on Jimmy's side for this
[00:40:31.070] Just don't think too if I'm catch myself thinking about 30 I'm like stop
[00:40:35.420] No, yeah, not yet
[00:40:37.340] So at the point you like you do some dumb shit and your 30 you're gonna be like why did I do that fucking 30
[00:40:46.280] Oh, you can't be like oh, I'm just 20 something
[00:40:50.680] Yeah, I'm just 20. Hey, there's a lot of like expectations to once you hit 30 and above right and especially in the Bay Area too
[00:41:03.640] Like you know what milestones you got hit well you got to get married in your 30s
[00:41:11.320] You got to essentially you know have a kid in your 30s get house in your 30s
[00:41:16.920] You know some big-ass responsibilities and that's the type of stuff that like it's like a low intimidating
[00:41:23.100] And I'm also excited for it going to crystal it's gonna be your third puberty. I guess
[00:41:30.260] Down you right
[00:41:32.580] When you're legit like oh fuck I got to settle the fuck down how many puberty is must we go through before it stops
[00:41:44.240] I think honestly we have a big break between like 30 up until 50 when your kids leave for college
[00:41:52.900] Like another puberty like oh shit what what do I do you know
[00:41:57.020] That's why they have been life crises at 50
[00:42:02.000] Yeah, yeah, so I might step down on my mom all bought porches and shit
[00:42:08.040] Yeah, like damn dude you only need this task of a car you drive 65 on the right
[00:42:12.800] Right way, no, you're like hey, can I borrow this car?
[00:42:16.800] I mean honestly, I think parenthood could also be a puberty too because puberty to me is like when you learn so much about yourself and you're like unfamiliar
[00:42:25.180] And like growing in that unfamiliarity and I think parenthood will be very new and strange for all of us
[00:42:32.860] So honestly it's infinite puberty
[00:42:36.760] Yeah, yeah, you got to go with your kids puberty
[00:42:40.740] That's probably your own you know, I'm sure
[00:42:43.020] I don't do it this fucking devil
[00:42:46.080] You're like wait was I like that when I'm just a little crisis too
[00:42:51.860] Yeah, oh my god, yeah
[00:42:54.160] I remember when I was you know going to puberty I guess I was sneak out all the time with you
[00:42:59.620] You're so good times
[00:43:03.800] Go to denies, you know my dad was literally like crystal you became like the devil spawn
[00:43:13.200] Oh my god I had this conversation with my mom recently too
[00:43:17.320] She was like yeah, your puberty came kind of late more when you were like 1780
[00:43:22.020] Like I don't know why you didn't go through it whenever and also is going through it
[00:43:26.040] Not the belated flames like 10 years later
[00:43:30.720] Like why are we talking about this right now?
[00:43:34.000] By the way you're a chic kid
[00:43:37.780] And not only that too, like you waited to be a chic kid
[00:43:44.900] Yeah, another thing about it oh man, I don't know how I'm going to go through it
[00:43:48.220] Like when I was a kid oh my god
[00:43:51.240] From home without to deal with like weed smell
[00:43:54.160] It's stuff you know in the house there's one time I snuck out and actually no when I sneak out I'd put like you know pillows
[00:44:01.860] Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god
[00:44:04.700] And then I had like a Halloween mask with hair in it so I put that to my dog and stuff
[00:44:12.220] And then one time she caught me because I was being stupid and I took my car
[00:44:17.560] So she was like where the fuck is this car she went up she actually that all this mother
[00:44:26.540] You really thought some pillows would fool her like the way crazy actually
[00:44:32.900] Yeah, I should have just walked to that yeah
[00:44:35.420] The place that we went to was like five minute walk and move is too long for sure
[00:44:41.900] Well, I do have a final question for us before we wrap this episode
[00:44:45.940] We basically talked about the evolution of our life from our early 20s through our late 20s and now that you kind of look back a little bit on our late 20s specifically
[00:44:57.140] What grade would you give what?
[00:45:00.840] On like a A through F scale what grade are you giving life in your late 20s
[00:45:07.300] Honestly, I'll give myself like an A minus
[00:45:11.700] Maybe like a B plus I would say a B plus you know like a like where it's at I like where I am right now
[00:45:19.820] I like where it's going there's certain things I could have done better for the most parts. That's pretty good
[00:45:26.460] It's all the B plus, you know, it's like a eight and I'm playing five you know
[00:45:30.980] Oh, yeah, I'll go to the teacher. You're like hey, can you you bump me up to A minus?
[00:45:37.200] It's very close. I don't want to give myself a yeah, I think similar to crystal I would give it like a solid A minus
[00:45:46.320] But I think definitely something to like monitor like even if it is and a it's like a 93 or something like about to get into A minus territory
[00:45:54.220] Oh, yeah, I'm like almost B plus territory
[00:45:57.200] Oh, there it is
[00:46:00.000] Crystal's writing that 90 percent
[00:46:02.300] I'm like 90.0
[00:46:07.380] I'm like oh shit, we made it to A minus
[00:46:12.840] This is the shot
[00:46:15.280] I would say B plus just because there are some projects in my life that I've you know, I want to do and I bought the equipment to do but just haven't done it yet
[00:46:28.180] You know, like I bought a wrangler and I want to take it off-roading but I haven't had the time to do it right
[00:46:36.620] I could blame Ryle all the time like oh, you know, I got to take care of Ryle
[00:46:41.420] But if I'm being choose for my okay, but also waste my time doing some other stuff right
[00:46:46.220] And then I bought like a expensive camera too and I went just like video tape me cooking or me you know DJing and stuff and like just make like videos of that
[00:46:57.820] Haven't gone around to it. Okay, there's still two more years of our late 20s
[00:47:02.820] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:47:04.940] I got a couple of semesters alone
