[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal and I'm Jeesoo
[00:00:16.000]  So today we wanted to talk about what I think is very on topic for my day because I just went out last night
[00:00:30.000]  But we wanted to talk about partying responsibly and kind of surviving partying now that we're in our late 20s
[00:00:39.000]  Oh God, I feel so weird to say
[00:00:42.000]  Dude, it's kind of scary
[00:00:43.000]  But the good part about being in our late 20s is we've had a lot of experience
[00:00:48.000]  indulging in late nights and things like that
[00:00:51.000]  So then I feel like now I actually do have a routine that helps keep me alive
[00:00:57.000]  and minimizes hangovers and drunken mistakes
[00:01:02.000]  So today we're happy to share these things with you
[00:01:04.000]  Share from our learning so hopefully we can prevent one or two hangovers from our listeners' lives
[00:01:10.000]  Yeah
[00:01:11.000]  Well, I will say the first and probably most common tip is always make sure to drink water
[00:01:18.000]  Dude, this one seems so easy but I feel like sometimes it's really hard to remember and like keep up
[00:01:25.000]  It kind of depends on the pace of the night but I feel like the nights where it's really chill and relaxed
[00:01:31.000]  And everyone is kind of having a calm or time
[00:01:34.000]  Then I feel like it's easier to remember to drink water
[00:01:37.000]  But there are those nights where it's really fast paced maybe you're hopping from bar to bar
[00:01:41.000]  Then it's definitely hard to kind of keep up
[00:01:43.000]  True
[00:01:44.000]  I've noticed also actually that if you're drinking stuff like celtzers or beer
[00:01:51.000]  their water content is higher versus like say a straight up shot
[00:01:57.000]  That water content is not as much so I've noticed that I actually stay more hydrated drinking celtzers and beer
[00:02:04.000]  Even if I kind of forget to drink water in between
[00:02:07.000]  Yeah, that's a good point
[00:02:09.000]  I feel like it is kind of a double-edged sword sometimes though
[00:02:12.000]  Because celtzers and beer make me so bloated
[00:02:15.000]  So whether or not I'm drinking water I'm probably constantly running to the bathroom to go pee
[00:02:20.000]  So that it makes my brain think oh I'm keeping up with like my water intake
[00:02:24.000]  When in actuality I've drunk like no water
[00:02:27.000]  That's true
[00:02:28.000]  For instance like celtzers and shots I'm like okay yeah
[00:02:30.000]  I need to like keep up with water otherwise I will die tomorrow
[00:02:33.000]  So I think I'm a little bit better about it
[00:02:35.000]  Yeah, that's true because what is it like alcohol is a diuretic?
[00:02:40.000]  I think that's what it's called
[00:02:41.000]  It basically makes you want to use the bathroom more
[00:02:44.000]  So like even though you are drinking a lot of water content potentially
[00:02:48.000]  You're peeing it out just as fast
[00:02:51.000]  Yeah, and I don't know like this whole water thing
[00:02:54.000]  I've actually noticed that everyone's been getting a lot better about it
[00:02:58.000]  Because I'm sure we've all learned the same lessons as we're growing up together
[00:03:02.000]  So recently a couple nights when we were drinking
[00:03:06.000]  We would have a communal water cup
[00:03:09.000]  So then after each shot or after like a drinking game we would kind of pass it around
[00:03:14.000]  And I feel like it really just takes one person to remember the water rule
[00:03:18.000]  To keep everyone hydrated but I noticed that was like a huge help
[00:03:22.000]  Wow, yeah that sounds very helpful
[00:03:25.000]  I've definitely encountered moments where it was like
[00:03:28.000]  Oh don't forget to drink water and like oh yeah yeah yeah
[00:03:31.000]  And then I'm like wait
[00:03:33.000]  Where is there even water?
[00:03:35.000]  Yeah like if it's not in my hand I'm not gonna drink it
[00:03:38.000]  And then like the next second you're already moving on to something else
[00:03:41.000]  You forget about the water
[00:03:43.000]  Exactly
[00:03:45.000]  The other thing that I've tried in the past is
[00:03:48.000]  I feel like a lot of our friend groups we like playing drinking games
[00:03:52.000]  And those are kind of the things that keep us really hyped up at night
[00:03:56.000]  A couple times
[00:03:57.000]  I was like oh should we play this round with like water
[00:04:00.000]  Like water, rage cage or like water 7-11 doubles or something
[00:04:05.000]  And I always get shot down but I still look you think that
[00:04:08.000]  It might be a good idea
[00:04:09.000]  Fun day
[00:04:10.000]  Oh my god yes, I think that's genius
[00:04:12.000]  Just like pause drinking for a second and everyone drink as much water as you possibly can while having fun
[00:04:20.000]  Yeah exactly
[00:04:22.000]  And you can like target people to drink water in the games
[00:04:25.000]  It's like there's so many genius ways to keep your friends hydrated
[00:04:29.000]  This doesn't happen as much nowadays
[00:04:31.000]  But back when we were younger like maybe in college
[00:04:34.000]  It's always super funny when someone is like so drunk
[00:04:39.000]  That you are literally just feeding them water
[00:04:42.000]  And they'll only take it if they think it's a shot of alcohol
[00:04:45.000]  The classic yeah
[00:04:47.000]  I've had the inverse happen to me as well
[00:04:50.000]  Where I remember James was trying to feed me water
[00:04:53.000]  And I kept going like stop poisoning me
[00:04:55.000]  I don't want to drink anymore alcohol
[00:04:57.000]  Oh yeah
[00:04:58.000]  Because you lose your sense of trust
[00:05:01.000]  Last time they did this it was alcohol
[00:05:04.000]  But yeah I feel like that happens way less now
[00:05:08.000]  Now it's like we're all trustworthy
[00:05:10.000]  Oh this is actually water
[00:05:12.000]  Now we're all just like fighting for our lives
[00:05:15.000]  Trying to survive
[00:05:17.000]  Are there any other things that you do to help prevent potential hangovers?
[00:05:22.000]  I have one thing that I actually distinctly remember
[00:05:26.000]  Crystal you were the one who taught me this
[00:05:29.000]  And it's actually to give yourself a little bit of room in between whatever you're drinking
[00:05:35.000]  I think especially in college days
[00:05:38.000]  This was way worse now that we're all in our late 20s
[00:05:41.000]  I feel like no one really does this as much anymore
[00:05:43.000]  But I remember back in college it truly was like every five minutes
[00:05:47.000]  You were taking a shot with someone
[00:05:49.000]  And that obviously leads to crazy nights and crazy hangovers
[00:05:54.000]  And I remember once you were like
[00:05:56.000]  And what I found really helpful is to just give yourself like a timer in between shots
[00:06:02.000]  So at least 15 minutes in between shots if not even more time
[00:06:06.000]  And if someone comes up to you and says
[00:06:08.000]  Oh let's take a shot
[00:06:09.000]  You just be like oh I already took one so give me like 10 minutes or 15 minutes
[00:06:13.000]  And I remember at the time I was like
[00:06:15.000]  How can you just say like no to these people who are asking
[00:06:18.000]  Because as someone with social anxiety
[00:06:20.000]  Like I find it really hard especially if it's someone I know not too well
[00:06:23.000]  But then the more I thought about it I was like that's genius
[00:06:26.000]  Because without those cadences you're like signing a death wish basically
[00:06:31.000]  Oh my god yeah
[00:06:32.000]  And usually when you say that it's not a no
[00:06:34.000]  They'll be like oh right
[00:06:35.000]  Okay yeah like I'll come find you in 10 minutes or so
[00:06:38.000]  Yeah and half the time they might not even remember
[00:06:41.000]  Yep so that's already a way
[00:06:43.000]  Look at my watch and be like
[00:06:45.000]  Oh um at like whatever o'clock you will come back
[00:06:50.000]  Dude but it actually helps so much
[00:06:52.000]  Because you're still like being fun
[00:06:54.000]  And there's like something you're waiting for
[00:06:58.000]  So then I feel like actually setting that time makes it a lot easier for me to adhere to that schedule
[00:07:03.000]  Yeah you're right I feel like I don't have to do that as much nowadays
[00:07:07.000]  But I definitely you know it was a signature move back in college
[00:07:10.000]  I feel like some preventative stuff that I do now
[00:07:15.000]  I literally take like hangover prevention pills
[00:07:21.000]  So what I did before was there's this thing called Zbiotics
[00:07:26.000]  And I heard from like some friends they're like oh if you get hangovers
[00:07:29.000]  This thing is supposed to help you
[00:07:31.000]  It's like some probiotic you take before you drink
[00:07:34.000]  And it helps break all the alcohol down while you drink
[00:07:37.000]  So I like bought some and I tried it out
[00:07:39.000]  And I was like oh shoot I think it like kind of works
[00:07:42.000]  So if there's gonna be a big night ahead
[00:07:45.000]  You know maybe it's someone's birthday or we're like really celebrating something
[00:07:49.000]  I will make sure to like bring a Zbiotics for myself
[00:07:53.000]  But what I've discovered recently works even better is a combo
[00:07:59.000]  So like Zbiotics and also all those supplements I guess like vitamins before you drink
[00:08:07.000]  So I got these pills called purple pills and they're basically all the vitamins put into one pill
[00:08:14.000]  And so you take that before you drink
[00:08:16.000]  So that combo has like saved me a lot of times
[00:08:21.000]  Dude, I feel like the topic of supplements for drinking is so funny to me
[00:08:26.000]  Like there's a couple iconic faces but I always think how would I pick up pre-drinking pills
[00:08:32.000]  But I've also taken like rabbit pellets is what my friend calls it
[00:08:37.000]  So those are I think like a Korean version of pills that help you break down the alcohol
[00:08:42.000]  And you take them before drinking or even at the end of your drinking to kind of help prevent hangovers
[00:08:47.000]  But all this stuff I think is a game changer
[00:08:51.000]  Because when we went to Miami for my bachelor's last year
[00:08:56.000]  A lot of the things on the itinerary involved alcohol in one way or another
[00:09:01.000]  And I took a Zbiotics before every single activity and I didn't nurse a hangover the entire trip
[00:09:07.000]  Which was just honestly like amazing and miraculous
[00:09:11.000]  That was my mistake. I was like dead and hungover for one of the days
[00:09:16.000]  Because I forgot to pack my Zbiotics
[00:09:19.000]  Oh no!
[00:09:20.000]  I think the only downside to Zbiotics though is that they can get really expensive
[00:09:26.000]  I think they were somewhere around 10 to 12 dollars a pop
[00:09:31.000]  So it definitely adds up depending on how many times you take them
[00:09:35.000]  That's why I usually save them for like special occasions
[00:09:39.000]  But you're so right, I think the like drinking supplements is so funny
[00:09:44.000]  Because we have our one friend Tiffany who like before we even got into all of the you know like specialized pills
[00:09:51.000]  Zbiotics or whatever every time we drink and we would be at her place
[00:09:56.000]  She would pull out this like box of just pills
[00:09:59.000]  You know she like start handing them out like alright everyone get your B12 in you know
[00:10:03.000]  This helps me like literally Costco size box
[00:10:06.000]  Like this is gonna help for your water retention
[00:10:09.000]  And we're taking like five pills and we're like okay
[00:10:13.000]  But they actually did help I think like most of the time we woke up the next morning
[00:10:17.000]  Like oh you know I don't feel too bad and then there's always the warning like
[00:10:22.000]  Oh by the way when you take B12 your pee gets really yellow
[00:10:26.000]  Oh god
[00:10:27.000]  So don't be just gonna say that too
[00:10:29.000]  Like don't be too alarmed it's just cuz the pill itself is you know high in whatever color
[00:10:34.000]  Right
[00:10:35.000]  Our other friend Jen I feel like she's the one who's iconically known for the rabbit pellets
[00:10:40.000]  And every time I drink with her at one point in the night
[00:10:43.000]  She brings out the like Ziploc bag with like a billion rabbit pellets in it
[00:10:47.000]  She's like okay time to take our medicine
[00:10:49.000]  So I feel like there's just these friends who are known for their drinking supplements
[00:10:53.000]  And every time you party with them
[00:10:55.000]  It helps
[00:10:56.000]  And you know I definitely notice a difference
[00:10:58.000]  Yeah
[00:10:59.000]  Thank you to them
[00:11:00.000]  I know
[00:11:01.000]  Our supplement queen
[00:11:02.000]  Yeah
[00:11:03.000]  You know also sometimes for these like hangover prevention stuff
[00:11:09.000]  I actually will get home
[00:11:11.000]  And then if I feel like I'm really fucked up
[00:11:15.000]  I will take some of it
[00:11:17.000]  Mmm
[00:11:18.000]  When I remember I got home
[00:11:20.000]  And I was like oh shoot this wasn't supposed to be like a crazy night
[00:11:23.000]  But I'm like kind of drunk
[00:11:25.000]  Like
[00:11:26.000]  It's kind of bad and it's like late at night
[00:11:28.000]  So I dug out like a Z-biotics
[00:11:30.000]  And I downed that
[00:11:31.000]  And then I went to bed
[00:11:33.000]  And the next morning
[00:11:34.000]  I was like oh my god thank god
[00:11:36.000]  I like don't have hangover
[00:11:37.000]  I'm like somewhat alive
[00:11:39.000]  Actually that's a really good point
[00:11:40.000]  And I don't usually have like drinking supplements at my house unfortunately
[00:11:46.000]  I should but I don't
[00:11:47.000]  So my version of that is if I get home and I'm feeling really drunk
[00:11:52.000]  That's like a sure sign that you'll be fucked up tomorrow
[00:11:55.000]  So then I always try to force myself to take like a bottle of liquid iv
[00:12:00.000]  Or at least grab a bottle of water
[00:12:02.000]  And have it on the nightstand
[00:12:03.000]  And just in case the next morning is kind of rough
[00:12:06.000]  And I do feel like the nights where I go to sleep after
[00:12:09.000]  Trugging like a whole bottle of something helps a lot
[00:12:12.000]  Like I feel a lot less headache-y
[00:12:14.000]  Like I might still be a little nauseous in the morning
[00:12:16.000]  But the headache thing definitely helps a lot
[00:12:18.000]  Oh my god yeah
[00:12:19.000]  There's definitely been times where
[00:12:21.000]  Because I don't get the best sleep after drinking
[00:12:23.000]  So there's definitely been times
[00:12:25.000]  Where I wake up at like an ungodly morning hour
[00:12:29.000]  Well ungodly to me
[00:12:32.000]  You're like 9-8
[00:12:35.000]  And then I'm like oh shoot, I'm like still drunk
[00:12:37.000]  Or I'm still you know feeling kind of shitty
[00:12:39.000]  So I'll just chug hell of water
[00:12:41.000]  And then I'll go back to sleep
[00:12:43.000]  And when I wake up the next time I feel a lot better
[00:12:45.000]  Dude how was water just so like, keres all
[00:12:49.000]  Wait so powerful
[00:12:51.000]  And I feel like also too
[00:12:54.000]  Even if it doesn't completely cure your hangover
[00:12:58.000]  The effect of having water in your system helps so much
[00:13:01.000]  So in case you're feeling really nauseous
[00:13:03.000]  Then something comes up I feel like it's a lot smoother
[00:13:06.000]  And like less painful of an experience
[00:13:08.000]  If you're actually hydrated
[00:13:10.000]  Versus if you're completely dehydrated
[00:13:12.000]  Then I feel like throwing up in the morning can be way more painful
[00:13:15.000]  Yeah
[00:13:16.000]  Actually a tip that I've kind of picked up
[00:13:18.000]  There are years of experience
[00:13:21.000]  Is that if you feel really bad like you're about to throw up
[00:13:24.000]  You should pop a thumbs
[00:13:26.000]  Because that will help neutralize the acidity that's about to come up
[00:13:30.000]  So you'll feel better when you throw up
[00:13:34.000]  It won't burn your throw as much
[00:13:36.000]  That's a really good tip
[00:13:38.000]  Sometimes you just can't help it
[00:13:40.000]  It's like the only thing that might help you feel better
[00:13:42.000]  Yeah
[00:13:43.000]  Oh man
[00:13:44.000]  But the good thing is I feel like nowadays
[00:13:46.000]  We don't reach that point as often
[00:13:48.000]  You know like drinking to the point where we have to like throw up
[00:13:51.000]  Or like feel super shitty the next day
[00:13:53.000]  I think that's you know part of a part of getting older
[00:13:57.000]  I know it's grow
[00:13:59.000]  And being more responsible
[00:14:03.000]  I think one of the things that's been helping lead to that too
[00:14:07.000]  Is like there are certain things or certain factors that
[00:14:11.000]  If I noticed them before a night out
[00:14:13.000]  Then it might lead to heavier drinking
[00:14:15.000]  Or it might lead to a worse morning the next day
[00:14:19.000]  So this is something that I feel like has made a big difference
[00:14:23.000]  So one of the things that I always try to check now
[00:14:25.000]  Is I need to have a completely honest vibe check with myself
[00:14:29.000]  Before I go on a night out
[00:14:31.000]  And what that means is
[00:14:33.000]  If I'm like kind of in a bad mood
[00:14:35.000]  Or I'm like feeling anxious about something
[00:14:39.000]  Or there's something where I'm not completely comfortable
[00:14:42.000]  And like excited for the night out
[00:14:44.000]  Or if I'm too excited
[00:14:46.000]  Then I feel like the alcohol intake that night might get a little bit crazy
[00:14:51.000]  In the sense where like I'm only drinking alcohol
[00:14:54.000]  Not thinking about water and not constantly checking in with myself
[00:14:58.000]  But the nights where I'm comfortable
[00:15:00.000]  And I'm like excited but not too excited
[00:15:02.000]  You know things are looking good then usually
[00:15:04.000]  I feel like it's way easier to control this level of drinking
[00:15:07.000]  So then now if I'm like
[00:15:09.000]  Okay I might be kind of in a bad mood
[00:15:11.000]  Or like this might be kind of off
[00:15:13.000]  But let's say extra vigilant
[00:15:15.000]  Really try to make sure that I'm vibes checking myself all night
[00:15:20.000]  Otherwise it won't lead to like a good amount of drinking i think
[00:15:24.000]  That's very diligent of you I think
[00:15:27.000]  Because you're right, I think
[00:15:30.000]  In times where maybe you're kind of stressed out
[00:15:33.000]  Or something upsetting happened during the day
[00:15:36.000]  It's so easy to be like
[00:15:38.000]  tonight like fucking I'm just gonna you know go hard and like drink my worries away.
[00:15:44.560]  I've definitely had that feeling before too so I like that you just double check with yourself
[00:15:49.440]  you're like okay I'm feeling this way today so let's keep it real to him or whatever.
[00:15:55.280]  Yeah I feel like it's especially on those days where I'm looking for some kind of crutch
[00:15:59.920]  and then if alcohol is there as a potential then recently I've been thinking like maybe I should
[00:16:04.080]  just dd on those days and then that way it's truly like I can go and vibe and hang out
[00:16:09.360]  and maybe relax a little bit but I'm still gonna have to drive home so I won't drink really.
[00:16:14.080]  Wow very responsible.
[00:16:18.480]  Originally when you mentioned the vibe check I was thinking in my head you know how sometimes
[00:16:24.000]  in the middle of partying or the evening or whatever you need to go the bathroom and you have a
[00:16:29.440]  moment like looking at yourself and then be heard and you're like am I good right now?
[00:16:34.960]  Wait oh my god the immediate it's like a sobriety check that's like the true test when you sit down
[00:16:41.200]  you're like I feel woozy and then yeah it's like the mid game checkup or whatever.
[00:16:48.480]  And then you're like okay I'm like a little drunk right now I should tone it down so that I can
[00:16:53.440]  have a good night's rest tonight.
[00:16:56.800]  That's a good point though I feel like those are really true checkpoints for yourself throughout the
[00:17:00.960]  night of like am I well like should I do I need to do I need to stop or am I good to continue?
[00:17:07.200]  Seriously are there any other like checkups that you do for yourself?
[00:17:12.640]  So this is something that I feel like I can be kind of bad at but this truly clues me in on whether
[00:17:19.280]  tomorrow is gonna be a rough or not.
[00:17:20.960]  I feel like on the nights where I'm checking my phone decent amount checking the time making
[00:17:26.000]  sure that it's not too late or anything usually I'll be fine the next day but there's certain
[00:17:31.360]  nights where the time just completely escapes you and you check your phone and it's like 8 p.m.
[00:17:36.800]  and then the next time you check your phone it's like 2 a.m.
[00:17:39.120]  Oh god those are truly the nights I'm like okay yeah tomorrow's gonna actually suck.
[00:17:43.840]  You're like wait what happened to all those hours?
[00:17:46.160]  Yeah that's so funny but honestly it's a pretty good indicator it makes sense when you say it
[00:17:52.880]  because it's kind of like how aware are you of making these little checks in the middle versus
[00:17:59.840]  like everything's just out the window okay I have a maybe it's like kind of graphic but
[00:18:07.840]  I feel like for me it helps a lot is I kind of keep track of my p color throughout the night.
[00:18:16.320]  Wait what I'm intrigued.
[00:18:19.040]  You know the more hydrated you are usually the more clear your p is so I keep track of how yellow
[00:18:26.880]  I guess or clear my p is throughout the evening and I think it kind of helps give a general sense
[00:18:33.680]  of am I hydrated or not? That's a really good way to check because you always kind of look when you
[00:18:39.920]  see the data is there so I've been kind of doing that more often because you always have to go
[00:18:49.280]  the bathroom right so I might as well check as you said the data is there I might as well harvest it.
[00:18:58.480]  I like that though because the starting point is like oh how often am I drinking water and then
[00:19:03.040]  you do like the double check of am I actually staying hydrated enough? Yeah so that's how I've kind
[00:19:08.480]  of noticed that like cellars and beers these things that are a little more high in water content
[00:19:15.360]  versus other alcoholic drinks it like keeps me hydrated because when I go to the bathroom I'm like
[00:19:20.160]  oh my p is like very clear. That's hilarious honestly I feel like it's also so funny because
[00:19:28.640]  all these little checks and like all these little things kind of point to how many rough mornings
[00:19:33.680]  we've had in the past that like lead us to do all these checks now or like we can't have another
[00:19:38.400]  morning like this anymore. Literally last night I went to the bathroom at one point and I was like
[00:19:43.520]  oh shoot my piece like a little yellow when we get back I'm gonna need to chuck some water.
[00:19:49.680]  I feel like also what I've started doing is usually when I go to sleep and I'm feeling really drunk
[00:19:56.320]  by the time I fall asleep it'll give me like some sort of hangover the next day so I'll like always
[00:20:02.160]  try to check in with myself right before I sleep and see where I'm at just so I can like mentally
[00:20:06.800]  prepare and for the most part if I'm doing that check I'll be fine the next day but if I don't do
[00:20:12.000]  that check in with myself then I know it's gonna be a little bit rough. Yeah I think I sometimes
[00:20:18.560]  if I am feeling pretty drunk still I'll try to like stay up for a little bit. I don't know what
[00:20:25.280]  the science is behind this maybe like it gives your body more time to process or something
[00:20:30.560]  but I feel like it does help a little bit. I think it does too and I feel like if you don't do
[00:20:36.160]  that then what you mentioned earlier happens where you wake up still feeling drunk and you're kind of
[00:20:40.640]  like um I feel okay and then you like pass out again and then you wake up again at like one
[00:20:44.720]  pm and you're definitely not okay. Yeah okay also I feel like having responsibilities the next day
[00:20:52.160]  is usually really good at keeping me in check as well so if I know I can't sleep in the next day
[00:20:59.120]  because I need to to like recover properly then in the back of my mind I'm always like okay I have
[00:21:05.120]  like responsibilities tomorrow. I can't like I can't just go crazy. Yeah that's a good point although
[00:21:11.920]  I think it can be a double edge sword where sometimes the things happen or the night escapes you
[00:21:17.840]  and then you're just in between a rock and a hard place the next day. Yes that's very true. Like for
[00:21:22.560]  example today we literally woke up at 9 a.m. to record. I think I texted you at like 855 where
[00:21:30.320]  I was like oh god I'm like just crawling out of bed. I pushed your back like 10 minutes.
[00:21:37.760]  I think last night you were like oh I'm out celebrating something and then I texted you like
[00:21:42.160]  are we gonna make the night again tomorrow? I remember I was like yeah like I'm keeping my
[00:21:48.240]  drinking and check as I'm like drinking a fat glass of wine. Hey this is late 20s life. This
[00:21:54.640]  is true responsibility us recording this on 9 a.m. oh my god yeah college me could never
[00:22:02.880]  so earlier you mentioned for you losing track of time is a signal that you might be hung over the
[00:22:09.520]  next day. I kind of thought about it and I think for me when I have those face-to-face with myself
[00:22:17.040]  in the mirror and I look at myself and I'm like oh I'm like kind of drunk that's like a sign
[00:22:26.240]  that I might be fucked up the next morning. Oh my god dude been there truly. It's like there's
[00:22:33.840]  like a level two right you're like oh I am at the level where I might not be okay tomorrow morning.
[00:22:39.440]  Yeah I think the beginning stages of when I know I'm like really buzz is when I look at myself
[00:22:44.400]  in the mirror and I'm just like captivated by my own beauty. Because when you're like
[00:22:48.640]  inebriated. I'm just like oh my god like I look great and that's like the start. And then the
[00:22:54.720]  end point is like when you're almost having like a conversation with yourself in the mirror. Yes
[00:22:59.920]  yes you get together. You're like okay put on a straight face and get back out there.
[00:23:06.640]  Yeah like your own coach. I think also a bad sign for me is if I think back on the evening and
[00:23:15.920]  I always had a drink in my hand. Oh that's a good point. Then I'm like oh whether it was intentional
[00:23:22.080]  or not I was probably drinking the entire time even if it was just like sips and that adds up
[00:23:28.160]  and I'll probably be unwell the next day. Dude and on top of that night's where I look back and
[00:23:34.720]  I'm like oh shit I probably should have eaten more for dinner or something. That is always going
[00:23:39.520]  to be a sign that you might have a hangover because I feel like if you don't have much food in
[00:23:44.800]  your stomach or the type of food you had was super light or something like that then even if you
[00:23:49.360]  drink a little bit or like a half a couple of drinks like it'll really shake my system. That's so
[00:23:55.040]  true. It's always very important to eat beforehand. So this kind of reminds me of one of the nights on our
[00:24:02.400]  bachelor's at trip last year where the venue was supposed to be dinner and drinks. And I was
[00:24:07.840]  kind of like oh you order for yourself. I'm going to just like the welcome night so it was like a very
[00:24:12.640]  chill and casual environment. So we were like standing around a pool at like standing tables
[00:24:18.000]  when it wasn't really like a true sit down and like waiter experience. So then naturally I feel
[00:24:23.680]  like a lot of us devolved more onto like the drinking side than the eating side and then I know
[00:24:29.680]  we had some like casualties from that night and I look back and I'm just like yeah that's truly
[00:24:35.760]  like what happens when everyone is really excited and it's not like a sit down dinner kind of a venue.
[00:24:41.680]  Yeah to be fair they also served us the alcohol first and I think a lot of us were like empty
[00:24:47.440]  stomachs like we just got there earlier like a couple hours ago so we're like okay I guess
[00:24:52.400]  I'll have some drinks. And I feel like if you look at the menu or like the yellow it doesn't seem
[00:24:58.080]  like that kind of plays it kind of does seem like a sit down and eat sort of play so we were
[00:25:02.320]  definitely baited into having some unfortunate decisions. Yeah we ended up drinking a decent amount.
[00:25:07.920]  Yeah I remember they served us these giant punch bowls and yes at first like when you drink
[00:25:12.960]  it you're like oh okay like it's not too bad it tastes good but then later into the evening it was
[00:25:17.840]  like oh wait I'm like kind of fucked up. Dude actually that brings up such a good point.
[00:25:25.440]  Sometimes I think about if alcohol tastes too good or you don't taste the alcohol enough in it
[00:25:31.600]  that'll really fuck people up so like in college I think the biggest perpetrator was jungle juice
[00:25:37.680]  in adulthood. I've had some experiences with like so many towers where it's like the soju and
[00:25:43.600]  the beer and it just tastes like beer but it's way stronger things like that are always step traps.
[00:25:48.960]  So sometimes I'm like maybe the alcohol we're drinking needs to like actually taste like shit.
[00:25:55.520]  No you're so right it's so dangerous when the alcohol tastes good.
[00:26:01.440]  Okay that's why I think celtzers are like quietly very dangerous because if you get a box of
[00:26:07.840]  like tasty celtzers you know you kind of rip through those pretty quickly.
[00:26:12.400]  I feel like the one good thing about celters though is that if they're super carbonated you get
[00:26:16.880]  so bloated that like basically it's impossible to drink anymore. True but another death trap thing
[00:26:23.520]  that I can think of is when someone compliments you too much slash challenges you to drink.
[00:26:30.560]  Oh man. I feel like that it's never a good idea and I've learned my lesson on like never speak
[00:26:36.160]  those words of like this person as good as you like literally never say that because you're setting
[00:26:41.360]  them up for failure essentially. Yes yes. I think that was a very common thing that happened to me
[00:26:47.920]  in college where people would be like oh shoot like crystal can drink a lot actually and then
[00:26:52.800]  people would be like oh she can drink a lot then she'll be able to like you know take shots with
[00:26:56.320]  us and all right and then you like you know you end up dying. Yeah I don't know if any college
[00:27:04.240]  students listen to this but if you do listen to this then I would say that's the one reputation
[00:27:08.880]  you do not want to have in college. Yeah because you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
[00:27:13.840]  exactly so always pretend like you can't drink even if you can't. Yeah stumble a little bit you
[00:27:20.880]  know put on the act like oh no I'm so drunk exactly. Okay Loki though I feel like people who get
[00:27:27.280]  red get like Asian glow there's a benefit there because then they're like oh yeah like I'm so
[00:27:33.760]  fucked up look how red I am. That's a good point actually just like physically you're like oh maybe
[00:27:41.200]  this person is not as well but in reality they might be fine. A person with no Asian glow might be
[00:27:48.160]  fucked up. It's funny because like me and you we don't really get Asian glow but our boy friends do
[00:27:57.840]  and then I say oh like these two are fine and we're like oh no we're not fine.
[00:28:04.240]  But yeah actually Asian glow is a really funny thing too because you and I both don't get it we
[00:28:08.800]  don't fully understand or know the perspective of people with Asian glow but I remember once
[00:28:13.840]  I was traveling in Asia with a couple of friends who do get it and they were like I've never felt so
[00:28:19.440]  at home like I feel so safe going out at night and drinking because everyone else at the bar looks
[00:28:25.360]  less well than me. They're with their people yeah well aside from hangover prevention is there
[00:28:33.520]  anything that you do or take note of that really kind of signals you'll have a good night?
[00:28:39.840]  So I think the first thing is what I mentioned earlier which was don't go into nights out when you're
[00:28:45.280]  in a bad mood because that might lead you to not have a really good gauge on how you're feeling and
[00:28:51.840]  whatnot but I feel like another thing too is to kind of lean into what you're feeling on a night out.
[00:28:59.520]  So what I mean by that is even if you're not drunk or like even if you feel completely sober
[00:29:06.560]  I feel like if you pretend you're more drunk than you are then one you'll drink less and two
[00:29:11.520]  you'll have a really good time and it sounds kind of stupid but I feel like if you lean into that
[00:29:16.240]  feeling a little bit more instead of waiting for it to actually feel that way then you can kind of
[00:29:22.560]  set yourself up to have a good time because that's really the point of going out you know having these
[00:29:27.040]  nights is just have a good time. True I think like the power of the mind is so easy to forget about
[00:29:33.920]  sometimes it's really like making sure you're staying in a positive mindset and like positive mind
[00:29:40.800]  space. Yeah I totally agree and I feel like there's been nights where sometimes it gets into
[00:29:48.000]  something like really serious and people like start to open up about their feelings and stuff
[00:29:53.440]  and I feel like those nights actually do have a special place in my heart too just because
[00:29:57.920]  everyone opens up and you have really raw and honest conversations with your friends that you might
[00:30:03.040]  not otherwise but I feel like at the core of it it still needs to be positive. Yeah and
[00:30:09.280]  needs to be like a good and enjoyable experience for you to open up and say these things instead
[00:30:14.320]  of a completely sad and like down-trodden night basically. Yeah I think that's also like you want to
[00:30:19.920]  make sure you're with people that you love and trust too. I think that also helps with the vibes
[00:30:27.040]  overall because yeah like you said you're just you're out here having a good time with friends.
[00:30:33.440]  I could totally imagine being with people maybe more strangers or people that make you nervous
[00:30:39.920]  then you end up not having a great time because you're always like on guard or something like that.
[00:30:44.560]  Totally and I guess the last thing that I can think of is the buddy system. I feel like it's
[00:30:50.560]  always such a good way to make sure that you and all of your friends are gonna have a good time and
[00:30:56.160]  not a painful time so if you're going to grab some water make sure your friends are drinking water.
[00:31:01.920]  Don't go to like strange places by yourself just always make sure that you and your friends are safe.
[00:31:07.760]  I feel like that truly increases like the longevity of your friendships and like the wellness of
[00:31:12.400]  your friends as well. Oh my god that actually reminds me the buddy system it's okay to like leave
[00:31:19.120]  early too. If that's gonna make you feel better then you should just leave early even better if you
[00:31:24.160]  can like grab a friend if you don't want to like leave alone right be like hey are you also trying
[00:31:28.480]  to leave chances are your friend is also trying to leave. They're like oh thank god like someone finally
[00:31:35.920]  asked me to leave. That's true actually completely agree and I feel like truly at the core of it
[00:31:43.040]  is like don't feel obligated to like do stuff or stay or you know I feel like people feel so much
[00:31:48.960]  responsibility but at the end of the day it's just like a night out and it's fine to leave early
[00:31:53.440]  it's fine to put yourself first. It's fine to like vibe check and if the vibe check fails then you
[00:31:57.760]  can just head home and make sure that you have a good time and everyone else also has good energy.
[00:32:03.120]  Definitely like save your mental dude yeah this is late 20s learning.
[00:32:09.920]  Do seriously because I feel like when we're younger maybe there was like I don't know maybe a
[00:32:14.800]  sense of FOMO or you know something there that kind of kept us in these situations when we clearly
[00:32:21.920]  wanted to go home. Right no totally and I feel like there was a lot more peer pressure back then
[00:32:28.880]  and I used to think that term was so like dumb because you know how in those like dare commercials
[00:32:33.520]  or whatever peer pressure always came in the form of like some scary looking person being like you
[00:32:37.600]  have to do this or all or something bad will happen but I feel like truly in college like peer
[00:32:42.880]  pressure does not look like that. Peer pressure is like your friend being like oh you want something
[00:32:46.720]  and then you just internally put expectations on yourself sort of but now that we're feeling a
[00:32:52.240]  little bit more steady in terms of how confident we feel about ourselves you know where it maybe
[00:32:57.440]  able to gauge what we want better now I feel like peer pressure is not as big of a deal anymore.
[00:33:03.520]  Yeah definitely. I think we all have learned to like respect each other's boundaries more
[00:33:09.840]  and respect when we put ourselves first too because no one wants anyone to like go home in a bad
[00:33:16.240]  state everyone wants people to get home safely we're always like oh my god make sure you text us
[00:33:21.120]  when you get home like get back safely and we always double check with everyone like oh are you
[00:33:25.520]  good to drive you know all that stuff so maybe that is character growth for all of us.
[00:33:30.320]  True now or just like we're totally prioritizing everyone's well-being.
[00:33:36.640]  It's been a cool transition to see and plus we've suffered enough I think in past years.
[00:33:42.000]  I guess to be fair also in college a lot of times at least for our experience these events or
[00:33:48.800]  whatever were like house parties who we were already close to home but now it's like we're living
[00:33:54.400]  in the Bay and not everyone is each other's neighbors you know sometimes we have to drive like 30
[00:33:59.920]  minutes plus to get home so we're all like okay make sure you're safe first and foremost
[00:34:06.080]  and then do whatever you need to do. Definitely I think the DD system is at full works
[00:34:11.680]  whenever we have these nights so it's been really great to see. So I feel like everything we
[00:34:16.640]  just said points to heavy growth and yeah some wholesome vibes but the reality is sometimes even
[00:34:23.520]  now in our late 20s you slip up and you have a morning where you do have a hangover so what do
[00:34:30.000]  your hangovers kind of look like Crystal and what are some ways that you've learned help really
[00:34:34.480]  combat that hangover. Oh man. So one thing that's interesting is like media always portrays hangovers
[00:34:44.160]  as like you're sensitive to light you have a headache all that kind of stuff but my hangovers
[00:34:49.600]  aren't quite like that. Minor probably mainly some nausea and like feeling really really weak
[00:34:57.680]  and just feeling bad in general. I don't know if I necessarily get like sensitivity to light that much
[00:35:06.160]  but I just want to like sleep all day and I'm like so dead no energy feel really bad. Sometimes it's
[00:35:14.640]  so bad that I can't even keep anything down like I would want to throw up if I ate any food or drink
[00:35:20.720]  too much water. So I kind of just suffer through it for however many hours but I'm usually fine by
[00:35:28.080]  5pm. Dude the 5pm rule like Crystal's 5pm rule is so funny because we've done a lot of traveling
[00:35:36.800]  and like trips together and most notably I think like a year ago we went to Austin on a girl trip.
[00:35:42.720]  There was one day where we kind of drink a lot and then a couple of us were hungover
[00:35:47.520]  and literally like until 5pm Crystal was like the walking bed and then literally the second
[00:35:53.920]  after 5pm struck Crystal was completely fine and like normally you would be like what the fuck?
[00:36:02.800]  Yeah we ended up going out again like you know that night and I was like oh okay it's after
[00:36:07.680]  5pm I can make it. Oh my god but I think my hangovers are somewhat similar to yours. I don't have
[00:36:16.240]  like a specific time where I suddenly feel better but I definitely do kind of lay in bed and like
[00:36:22.960]  suffer quietly. I feel like some of the best stuff that has helped me though is having like a soda.
[00:36:31.760]  Having like a ice cold lemon lime spray always really helps. Something about like the
[00:36:38.000]  fizziness I think helps settle my stomach a little bit. Sometimes after a night out I feel like you
[00:36:43.040]  get like a kind of gross taste in your mouth and like in your system where you're just like oh I
[00:36:47.360]  feel like every time I breathe I can taste the alcohol so having something really sweet also helps
[00:36:53.040]  take that taste away and kind of freshen up my system. I heard that ginger ale is also nice too
[00:36:58.960]  because ginger sometimes helps with like nausea but yes I've definitely heard that tip but you know
[00:37:05.680]  sometimes I can't stomach it or just like the thought of eating or you know consuming stuff and
[00:37:10.720]  I'm sure this isn't helping either because you know I'm sure actually consuming something will help
[00:37:16.160]  my body have energy but I'm just like I can't right now. Dude and the struggle is like to eat
[00:37:22.960]  something usually you have to like sit up and I feel like sitting up is like one of the biggest
[00:37:28.240]  challenges of hangover days. Oh my god so for me sometimes it's a 50-50 like sometimes it feels
[00:37:34.080]  worse to lie down sometimes it feels worse to sit up. So one time in college I remember I got really
[00:37:39.840]  I was like super hungover and I couldn't lie down like it made me feel so nauseous so I just like
[00:37:46.080]  sat on my bed and I leaned against the wall and I like slept that way. Oh my god the things we do
[00:37:54.320]  to like not feel unwell. Oh man it's truly a struggle. So recently I was nursing like a mild
[00:38:01.920]  hangover and then we were hanging out with some of our friends and our friend was like I heard
[00:38:07.760]  you're actually supposed to like work out through a hangover like I heard if you sweat it makes
[00:38:12.160]  you feel a lot better and I was like how am I supposed to work out when I can't even do not lie
[00:38:16.960]  down. Like lie down is the only way I could survive the day. Dude okay you know the Korean reality show
[00:38:24.000]  I live alone so I was watching an episode one time one of the like panelists or one of the like
[00:38:31.440]  main characters I guess on the show she hosts a lot of parties and so the episode I watched she
[00:38:37.200]  hosted a party and then the next morning she was like kind of hungover. She literally put on
[00:38:42.800]  like some zoom-up video or something and started jumping around like crazy and working out and I was
[00:38:47.840]  like dude how is she doing this and then afterwards she was like oh yes I sweat I feel so much better now
[00:38:53.040]  and I was like wow that is just absurd I don't have that kind of energy. I mean I'm sure there's
[00:39:00.320]  some sort of validity to that because I do feel like after I take a really hot shower. Oh yeah
[00:39:05.760]  I feel so much better and maybe part of it is like your pores are opening up and like the toxins
[00:39:10.640]  are getting slid out through a really hot shower but it's just getting there is just so hard.
[00:39:16.240]  It really is. I commend people who are able to do that. Yes totally. I could never.
[00:39:25.680]  Well that was fun and very as I said on topic for me after surviving a night out and waking
[00:39:34.160]  up so early to record this podcast. The best part is I'm not even hungover. I'm just like kind
[00:39:39.520]  of tired because we have to wake up early and I think that is true character growth.
