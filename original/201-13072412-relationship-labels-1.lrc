[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Michelle. And I'm Eric. So welcome back, Michelle. The last episode Michelle was on with us was actually episode 188,
[00:00:25.230] Keeping Up With Your Old Work Connections. And she also had joined us way, way, way back towards the beginning of the podcast, episode 19, Welcome to the LDR Club. We talked about being in a long distance relationship. And Eric is her boyfriend that we talked about on that episode. So welcome, Eric. Thank you. Thank you. Episode 19, double digits. It was so long ago. I'm a vet. I'm a
[00:00:54.990] Eat Your Crust vet. You've been here since the beginning. Yeah. Yeah, welcome, Eric. Thank you. Thank you. I'm excited to be here. So honored. It took Eric so long. He had to move back to the bay first and then acquaint himself with us. And now he's finally on the pod. The long awaited LDR reveal. Yeah, you're right. We were long distance. The last time we chatted about Eric, it was mentioned. And
[00:01:23.730] now we live together. So before we dive into today's topic, I have a Gen Z phrase of the day. Oh boy. And the phrase is understood slash understanding the assignment. So I feel like this one is also one of those phrases that is generally easier to understand when you see
[00:01:50.050] it in context. Because usually it's like a comment and it's like, oh my god, so and so understood the assignment, which basically means that they did exactly what you would have hoped them to do and really well as well. Yeah. No, immediately comes to mind is when I had a gallons day, Calentine's day party. And then I was like, you got to wear pink and red. And everyone wore pink and
[00:02:15.010] red, including Crystal, who doesn't wear pink. So Crystal understood the assignment. You know who didn't understand the assignment? My friend Tiff Tosh showed up in all black. Tiff did not understand the assignment. Great example. Yeah. I think my first exposure to this phrase is through that song that I know is like, is the audio for a lot of TikToks. It's like, I understood the assignment. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And it's super catchy. So when I first heard it, it was just like stuck in my head
[00:02:44.870] all the time. I don't know why like this, this phrase is hard for me to use in real life. Like it just doesn't stick to my tongue. So I just always had the song running, but was never able to like verbalize it or use the phrase. I feel like I've mostly seen it just in like context of like Instagram reels or TikToks too, where just people are like either playing pranks on each other or doing something stupid. The people who play along, they just say like, oh yeah,
[00:03:10.630] they understood the assignment. Yeah. So I guess it's mostly lives online, like usually comments, but I feel like it's not too bad to use it in person. Maybe it doesn't feel as like Gen Z when you say it out loud, but I feel like it would totally make sense. When I think of that term, I think of how like, I just immediately jumped to like if someone's on theme. So I did a little bit
[00:03:34.350] of research and Jisoo, I think you're onto something because once again, we are referring to knowyourmeme.com. But it says, I understood the assignment is a song by musical artist Tay Money. Oh, that was released in 2021, September. And that song had a large amount of success on TikTok.
[00:03:58.230] And that might've been the origin. So it says like in August of 2021. So that's about one month before the song was released. The artist, she like posted something on TikTok, the hook of the song to build up hype and like get the marketing going. And that's when it first started going viral, apparently. Wow. Is that the song you're referencing, Jisoo? I think it is. Yeah. Eric, you know the song, right?
[00:04:26.630] I don't. What are you do? I understood the assignment. Yeah. I have to hear it. I can't say I know off the top of my head. I'm so sorry to disappoint. It's okay. I also don't know this song at all. Just me and Michelle in the know. I'm just thinking in my head right now. I'm vibing to it. I know. Uh-huh. Just playing in my head. Yeah. Eric, you watch so much TikTok.
[00:04:51.610] I don't, I'm not on TikTok. I just watch Instagram Reels. Eric, so yeah, that's the thing. We don't, we both don't have TikTok. So we're just- I'm like two weeks late. Yeah. Because we watch everything on Instagram Reels, but everything on TikTok makes its way in Instagram Reels. Before I watched TikTok, I actually used to watch like TikTok compilations on YouTube. YouTube. You're like, that's how you say I don't have TikTok, but you stay like relevant. So you like don't want to fully let yourself do that. That's so funny.
[00:05:20.490] Yeah. But also it wasn't even like TikToks that would keep me in the know. It was like boring ass TikToks of like cleaning or like Amazon hauls or like stuff like that. Crystal, that is what you would watch? Yeah. And I was like, dude, I'm like such a boomer. Like TikTok grocery hauls. Yeah. Like organization. I mean, they were good TikToks, but I'm not learning any Gen Z slang from
[00:05:48.790] them. Yeah. Okay. More on this know your meme page. It says September 2021. So that's now the song was released. A TikToker posted like a video of her weight loss journey and she used the song as the audio for it. And that one gained 5 million views in one month. So that might've been like what really, really spread it even more. And then now people just use understood the assignment. Dude. Nice.
[00:06:16.070] I think though, like there's just too many syllables on this phrase. You know what I mean? Like I would never say it because it's so long to say versus other Gen Z word, which is my favorite. Slay. It's one syllable. It's like so easy. Slip it in. Period. Yes, exactly. It's like quick and snippy phrases, right? Understood the assignment. It's like half my day is gone. Dude. That's a good point though. Slay is basically understood the assignment in one syllable, right?
[00:06:44.990] True. Like Crystal Slayed at my Galatine's party with her big sweater. Yeah. But now I know like it needs to be less than three syllables for Jisoo to use it. When Jisoo's doing her vows, three syllables. Preferably just one. Preferably just one. She's just up there to slay. She's like, otherwise half my day is gone. And James just goes, slay. Right.
[00:07:15.370] Then everyone just bawling, dude. Oh my God. It will be such an emotional wedding. That's crazy. That's heat. You have to do that now. Because we said it here on episode 201. You have to do that now. Now that you've said that, Jisoo, I'm surprised Gen Z used understood the assignment. Like they have the attention span to use the full phrase. I guess that's why it's only typed out for the moment.
[00:07:42.990] See, if this was a millennial phrase, it would definitely be an acronym. Oh. Oh, that's true. Huh. You're so right. Oh my God. UTA sounds too close to UTI. UTI. That's so funny. Yeah, we talked about this earlier in one of the episodes that Gen Z seems to not really use acronyms too much. But I think one that they do use is IYKYK. Yeah. They love that one. It's true.
[00:08:12.890] It's true. I feel like they shorten words. It's true. A lot of them are just shortened. Like charisma to riz. Oh my God. I feel like we're having a review of like every week that we've done. This is like review for the quiz, guys. Yeah. I think I told Michelle about one. I don't know if people still use it, but people spell gym, like going to the gym as J-I-M. Like the name gym. Wait, what? Oh. Yeah. I don't think people, it's more of like a joke now, I feel. I don't think people use it as much.
[00:08:41.390] But there's a period of time where I saw some people going like something related to the gym and they spell it like J-I-M. J-I-M. Yeah. Wow. Gen Z just owns words and changes them. Yeah. Who gave them the authority? Yeah. All right. Well, let's get to our topic of the week, which is relationship labels.
[00:09:03.030] So part of the reason why we brought Michelle and Eric on is because they actually legalized their relationship kind of recently within the past year. Yep. Not marriage, but like just a legal relationship. So we wanted to talk about that. But before we get into the depths of that, let's talk a little bit about relationship labels in general. One question that I always like to ask people is what do you call your partner out in the wild?
[00:09:32.710] Boyfriend, SO, girlfriend, you know, like what is the label you automatically attach to them? Right. Because Eric and I have been together almost 10 years. So when we say girlfriend, boyfriend, it sounds a little bit like, you know, it's like girlfriend, boyfriend. Like we've like that's what we were calling each other when we were 16, too. But then now we're like, we're not ready to be married, you know, like wife, husband. No. So I use partner most of the time.
[00:10:01.990] But then it also sounds like we're cowboys. Yeah, I say partner. What I've used that before. I've had people say, you know, when you say partner, you sound a little gay because it's not gendered. So I'm just going to kind of refer to when I moved back from Chicago to here, because when I was in grad school, I was just like girlfriend. When I started working in San Francisco, particularly, I did like my clinicals, other places, too.
[00:10:30.370] But particularly San Francisco, everyone would refer to girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever it is, as their partner, regardless of sex. So I was like, I didn't know if it was a San Francisco thing or if it was just because we're getting older or whatnot, too. But anyways, yeah, so everyone started saying partner. And similar to what Michelle said, I think a lot of my patients who are just older tend to try to say like partner instead just because it sounds more mature. Every way what Michelle said, girlfriend, boyfriend seems a little bit young of a thing to say.
[00:10:57.990] Or just like, I don't know if immature is the right word, but just not as sophisticated. And so they just say partner. Yeah, especially like at work, they don't know who I'm with. So I said partner before and they're like, oh, I hope they are your partner. They are OK because they don't know. Right, right. Don't assume. They don't assume. You can't assume. That's true. That's true. I'm just imagining Eric like moving back to the Bay and he's like, oh, is everyone I'm meeting just like gay?
[00:11:28.190] Dude, no lie. I wasn't sure for a lot of people. And I would also say that. I'd be like, oh, aren't they something? And for many times I would still not know until they said I used a pronoun. And I was like, oh, OK. Yeah. So I don't think there's a perfect word term. Yeah. Whatever you're comfortable with. You know what's interesting, though? I had a thought. So like, yeah, partner, SO are like a little more vague in terms of gender of your partner.
[00:11:56.050] But whenever people say fiance, don't you just automatically kind of assume like a heterosexual relationship? That is true. I do. Very interesting because fiance sounds the same for both genders. Oh, shit. Crystal's on to something. I do think there is like a sort of benefit to the vagueness, though, of partner SO.
[00:12:21.350] I guess even sort of fiance because for boyfriend and girlfriend and wife and husband, I feel like both terms age you a little bit in the sense that when you say boyfriend and girlfriend, you sound younger. And then wife and husband, to me, when someone says that, I'm always like, OK, you're like 30 plus, even though they might not be. Like, I'm just like totally assuming that. So I'm kind of dreading it. Like once me and James get married, I'm like, I'm going to say, oh, I have a husband and everyone's going to assume I'm like 35. So I don't know.
[00:12:51.310] Looking for some loopholes out here. I need some ideas. You just keep calling him your partner. True, true. I don't know about you guys, but I feel like especially in Asian culture, like once you get married, the terms that you use to call someone is it gets different to like someone might call me like Jeejie or Jeejie. But then once I get married, they'll call me like Ayi. Oh, right. Which is like, boom, you you're middle aged like suddenly. Wait, that's such a good point.
[00:13:18.770] Actually, like just the fact that we're aging, they're not really calling us older sister anymore. It's more like, oh, do we call this person like auntie or older sister? And I can always see someone like calculating in their brain when they have like a young child. They're like, all right, what do I tell my child to call Crystal? And especially once you're married, it's like, oh, that's the label will be different. Yeah, for sure.
[00:13:46.890] We were traveling recently on the plane and we didn't get seats next to each other. To beg to get seats together. Like you can't just say, I want to sit next to my boyfriend. Like you sound, you're a child. No. So I was like, you had to say like a partner. I even honestly, I said husband because I need to know. I really need to sit next to this man.
[00:14:09.290] We were going to try to get upgraded in Europe by trying to say like Beyonce to pretend that he was in it. Oh my God. And we chickened out. We just got engaged, but then we chickened out. But we put on rings and shit too. Oh my God. Oh shit. You had rings at the ready? Yeah, we were, I literally brought them ready to be committed. And then I was like, let's just, we can just stick with the room that we bought.
[00:14:40.610] Don't want to be disple. I love that though. That's so funny. We didn't do it. We didn't do it. I can't believe you, you even brought rings. Dude. Now I'm sad that you didn't do it. I really wish you did. We should have committed to the bit, man. We should have done it for this podcast. Damn it. They had the props ready. I know. That's smart though. Because one time me, Jisoo and some of our other girlfriends were on a trip and then we
[00:15:09.650] were just like, oh yeah, this is totally Jisoo's bachelorette. And then we got like free champagne at like one of the dinner spots. And we're like, dude, this is a hella worth. Oh my gosh. We should do that more often. Yeah. Let's just fake be engaged all the time for free stuff. But then when your actual engagement happens, everyone will be like, wait, weren't you engaged for the past three years? Yeah.
[00:15:37.130] I figured that doing that would give us bad karma. So I was like, dude, I don't know, man. Okay. That's fair. There's a potential. There's a potential. Maybe there's a limit. There's a threshold. Don't abuse it. Don't abuse it. With great power comes great responsibility. There you go. Shout out Spider-Man. Well, this kind of deviates a little bit from like the whole label aspect.
[00:16:02.450] But I do feel like a lot of times in society or like especially at work, there's sort of a need to explain your relationship to people sometimes. And I kind of wonder if it happens more when you're younger. I feel like people are always asking me like, oh, how'd you meet James? Or like, oh, like what's the backstory? And kind of like you guys, James and I have also been together for like over eight years now. So I feel like I'm always in a loop and I say the exact same story and the exact same sentences every time.
[00:16:32.450] And it's like a perfected story. So, yeah, sometimes I think about it and I'm like, damn, it's kind of weird that I have to be like, oh, this is our backstory and blah, blah, blah. But in a way, it's cool and like nice when people want to get to know you. No, I agree. Do you guys watch How I Met Your Mother? I haven't. Sorry. No. Lily Marshall, the ideal couple, they've been together forever. Whatever their origin story is down to like a choreographed dance. Oh, my God. They know how to chime in and like and it's so sweet. And like, yeah, so I get that.
[00:17:02.750] No, I agree with that thing too. When I talk to all my patients and stuff too, I feel like I get a lot of practice in saying, depends on how comfortable I am. I have like an abridged version. I have like different links of it too. I'll have like a, we've noticed since elementary school, blah, blah, blah. Or I'll tell them like the whole thing. Like the whole thing. Anyways, it just depends on how comfortable I am with telling them my entire life story or relationship at least. Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:17:31.230] I'm thinking about this right now and I'm like, wow, I guess I haven't really asked my coworkers like how their relationships came to be. Is that rude of me? I hope not. I don't think it's rude. I think that's very personal. And like, if you guys, you guys are there, you guys are besties. Okay, cool.
[00:17:54.510] I think I've asked very like generic and vague ones where it's like, if you moved here, did you guys meet here? Or like, you know, before you moved? Just like very simple ones. But I'm not like, sit down, tell me your whole relationship story. Unless they like just recently got engaged or something. Right, right. You're like, wow. That's true. A lot of my closer coworkers, they have been married. So I guess I'm like, oh, well, I guess I just missed out on the lore. I'll just pick up the pieces as you guys all talk.
[00:18:24.350] Yeah. Plus, I feel like once people start to have kids, the like go-to question becomes kids. Like, oh, how old are your kids? What do they do? It's all about their kids. Very true. I actually have a question for you all that is kind of related to what we just talked about. Have you ever had a coworker explain like a new relationship to you and your coworker group, you know? I don't think I've ever experienced that.
[00:18:48.490] But that is such a funny question because I feel like a lot of small talk and like chit chat kind of references people important in your life. So usually your SO. I think maybe the trick is like if you keep your conversation about your SO really vague all the time, then you can always like have new bays and new loves. But it all just morphs into like one like giga boyfriend, you know? That's crazy. Jisoo. Jisoo is crazy.
[00:19:17.170] She's merging all the bays into one. Mastermind. Your coworkers are going to be like, so have you actually been together with James for eight plus years? Or like, you know, were there some fillers in there? This is like James V8. Like V9. Yeah, yeah. But like also what if you knew for sure that like a coworker was single? And then like have you ever had them like slowly introduce a partner?
[00:19:45.230] As we all know, my current coworkers, I don't know anything about them. Right. But my past coworkers who I was really tight with, it was nice because we were all girls. So we were all just really open with the new people coming in and the other like the another person being phased out. So it's very transparent. First name names up front. Oh my God. Yeah, it was. We were bold. Wow. Transparent.
[00:20:14.310] I've always kind of wondered about this because it's like, what if there's this one coworker that you know who's like single for all that you've known? And then suddenly, just like three years later, out of the blue, they're like, oh my God, I got engaged. And you're like, wait, what? And I think that might be something that's more like possible for people around our age just because like we're getting near the kind of age range of like engagements. I agree with that too.
[00:20:41.070] I had a, on one of my clinicals, my instructor, when I started, she had a boyfriend. She didn't explicitly say they broke up, but she was talking like she was single. And then I found out through a mutual, I guess, coworker at that time that they did break up.
[00:21:01.250] And then within that same span, they got back together and got engaged very shortly after all within that like clinical setting too. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I thought she was done with that guy. I was like, but apparently not. That is pretty juicy. Yeah. And you couldn't even like ask. I just didn't want to prod because she was, well, she was my instructor.
[00:21:27.250] So it was, it would have been a little bit personal in my opinion. You're like, really that guy? And she's like, all right, F, F for you. Yeah. Yeah. I needed, I needed her to pass me to graduate. So, you know, I was just going to be in the background. To see the flip side of Michelle's and my coworker, I guess my boss, but also kind of my coworker. He didn't tell us anything really about his personal life, but especially relationships.
[00:21:54.410] And I found out through my coworkers who would like pester him about it too. I think we were like having a, an offsite or whatever, like a team or a company dinner or something. And then he invited like the significant others. And I heard like, oh, are you going to bring this girl? And then I was like, who's that? And they're like, oh, it's his girlfriend. I was like, oh, he has a girlfriend. And I, yeah, they've been dating for like a year, year and a half. And I was like, huh, I had no idea.
[00:22:20.430] And then like recently they moved in together and he also didn't tell any of us until like, he was like, oh yeah, I'm moving. And then they were like, oh, okay. Do you have roommates? He just goes, oh yeah, I'm moving in with my partner. And I was like, oh, they had, we had no idea you guys were in that stage of the relationship, but that's great for you guys. Yeah. That illustrates like when I worked with all women, I knew everything about their personal lives and the men they were dating and their names.
[00:22:45.190] And then Eric, his boss is just dudes, just no personal conversation at all between the two. Dude. It's like that meme where your guy friend or boyfriend or whatever comes back and they're like, oh my God, like I just heard this piece of gossip. And then you're like, you ask a follow-up question and they're like, oh, I don't know. You're like, why didn't you follow up? I know. Oh my God. You're triggering Michelle. Yeah. Yeah. You're triggering me.
[00:23:14.710] Cause I'm like, this always happens. Eric's catching up with his guy friends. There's some juicy stuff. I'm like, did you talk to them about it? He's like, didn't come up. I'm like, that is, that is not like, how did that not come up? You're like, that's not how you socialize. Yeah. I'm like, what do you talk about? Dude, sports, man. Yeah. Loose sports. Jeez. Guys just speak on like a need to know basis.
[00:23:41.730] If you don't need to know, unless you explicitly ask, it's not, it's not important. It's not going to come up. I'm pretty sure there's been at least like one or two coworkers in the past where I found out later that they were married. And I was like, oh my God, like I literally had no idea because they just like kept it very private in the workplace. That's like so crazy to me because like Michelle, my current company is probably like 80% women. Right.
[00:24:09.610] When new people come in, we'll like kind of rotate through teams in our like bi-weekly all hands company meeting. Each team will do like a little slide like on themselves. So like I would present like, oh, like a Jisoo slide. And like, here's all this stuff about my life. And everyone who has like a partner or like is married will always put a little like kind of like a family photo and be like, I have two kids. Their names are this and this. A lot of people come on. They're like, oh, me and my wife are high school sweethearts and things like that.
[00:24:38.550] You know, it's like people I've never met. Like I've never even seen them in the office yet. And I'm like, oh yeah, you know, that guy, two kids, like one wife, whatever, whatever, like three dogs. One wife. I just know. Two kids. Two kids, one wife. There's just something about like something weird to me about how a relationship is something so personal. And like love is very like personal and like sacred and like private.
[00:25:06.170] But there's a really like external aspect about it, too, where you have to like come up with a good label and like a good story. And honestly, I feel like it could affect like your reputation in the workplace, depending on what your love life looks like, even though that's not really fair and doesn't have anything to do with like your professional life. So I feel like it is kind of a weird balance to have something so personal, be very open and like subject to judgment sometimes.
[00:25:34.830] Yeah, that's unfortunately the reality. I have friends who have met their significant others at like a rave and that's fine. Right. But like, do you want to tell your coworkers that? Oh, yeah. You're like, we met at a concert. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. Just like you got to modify the story or like certain details just to make sure it's work appropriate or just like public friendly because some of the finer details, it's like, oh, well, I would only share this with my really close friends anyway.
[00:26:04.650] I have a question for you two, Michelle and Eric. Now that you've legalized your relationship, do you call yourselves anything different to the outside world? Before we legalized it, I would say boyfriend a lot more often. Now I'm just like partner, you know, like I say it a lot more. Dude, I honestly flip. I wouldn't say that it has changed all that much. I think I try to talk at the level of the people I'm talking with.
[00:26:34.130] So if it's like a younger person, I will say girlfriend. But if it's like a older person, I'll say partner. Or if someone also says partner, I like they have a partner. I will also say that back. Right. So you just match their energy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be honest, guys. You guys, nothing has changed. It's the same. Even though, you know, as the relationship matures, we mature with it. But so maybe that's why we say it's a how I met your mother reference. Okay.
[00:27:01.130] So when you legalize your relationship, what what exactly is it like a domestic partnership? Yeah. Here, let me tell you. Okay. Yeah. Please tell us. I'll tell you the what we we can and can't do. So. So what has changed? You guys, not much has. But now we have a piece of paper that says both of our names. It's on our fridge. And it says this relationship is recognized by the secretary of state or something. Yeah. Eric's going to go read it.
[00:27:30.430] We're going to go on a field trip to the kitchen and see what that piece of paper says. But anyways, we have a piece of paper. Here we go. I know the podcast can't see it. Ooh. State of California, secretary of state, certificate of registered domestic partnership. Oh, domestic partnership. Yeah. Shirley Weber, secretary of state of California, certifies that Michelle and Eric were united in domestic partnership on 24th of January. Wow.
[00:27:57.950] So the only difference is that Shirley Weber knows who we are. Probably. Thanks, Shirley. Yeah. But like now health insurance, we can get on each other's health insurance. That's a big one. If I go to prison, Eric can visit me. Oh, my God. Nice. That's huge. And if I'm hospitalized, Eric can also visit me. That's a big one. Yeah. If I pass away, Eric can get bereavement leave for me.
[00:28:26.890] Wait, you can't if you're not in a legal partnership, you can't get bereavement leave for that? I guess it depends on your company, like how strict they are. Legally, we can now. We can legally be sad. Yeah. Yeah. And I think we can adopt kids, right? Wow. We can adopt. That's so cool. Whoa. It's a serious relationship. Yeah.
[00:28:54.070] But there's no social security benefits, so we can't file taxes together. And I think that's it. Honestly, that's probably pretty good that you're still able to file taxes separately. I think at our age, sometimes it's better that way. Yeah, I agree. We mostly did it for the insurance. It didn't really work out.
[00:29:16.790] Because for just so, I guess for you to know Jisoo as well, if you try to get on James Insurance or vice versa, there's a 30-day limit with the qualifying life event. So you have to change your insurance. I guess with any insurance company, you have to change your status or qualifying life event within 30 days in order to either get the money or insurance or go on to their insurance. And if you don't, you have to wait until the next cycling period. Yes. Wow.
[00:29:46.590] So you know how we learned that? It's because we missed the period. And the whole point of entering a domestic partnership in the first place, we didn't even – I can't even get on Eric's insurance until the next period. So let's learn. It's almost – wait, is it November or October that the enrollment period is – Something like that. We're getting there. We're almost there. Yeah. So the whole point of it, it didn't even work out.
[00:30:14.230] But hey, if I die, Eric can bereave me. Nice. Love that. Kind of off topic, but like the bereavement leave policies in like the employee handbooks are always so awkward. Like I read it sometimes and it's like, okay, parents X days, wife X days, uncles one – you know, it's like listed out by like a line item almost. And I'm like, oh my God, like this is how much I can get for like each family member.
[00:30:43.610] It's so like weird to read. They calculate. They quantified every family member. Who gets the top score? Who gets the top score? I think it's your partner or your parents. Yeah. Okay. Really weird to like quantify your closeness with like each family member. Like what if your uncle was like your dad and you only had one day? That would suck. Yeah. It's fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It really is.
[00:31:12.550] Just imagine reading the book and being like, oh, fuck. Wow. James died. I get 10 days old. Oh, no. Jesus is like, better not die soon, James. Okay. So now I know that you guys signed for a domestic partnership because I've also heard there's like a civil union or something. They're the same thing. Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, interesting.
[00:31:39.890] So it's the process is what did we do, Eric? We I got a form. Yeah. We had to sign up basically sign this form. The most annoying thing was getting it notarized. But fortunately, Michelle's mom has a friend who's a notary who did it for free. Yeah. I have connects, you know. And then after that, he just had to like, he did a bunch of stuff. And he was basically like, sign here, sign here. Signed it. And then we nailed it. Got a thumbprint. Yep. Thumbprints. And then we mailed it in. Okay, wait.
[00:32:09.950] So what does a notarizer do? A notarizer? Just as like there to be like, this is legit. Okay. They were given power by the state to be like, is this legit? And they're like, this is legit. And then once they sign it, it's like the state is like, whoa. That's what they do. That's my understanding, at least. Okay. Yeah. I can't speak anymore to that.
[00:32:38.770] I will say, though, for the domestic partnership, before we did it, I always wanted to make sure that like you can still get married afterwards. Oh, right. And you can. You can also break this off. Yes. So we can separate. Yeah. But it's not like as messy. We can't marry other people. Yes. Oh, you can't marry other people? No. Oh, right. Because you're legally bound. Yeah. Wow. One wife only for me. Yeah. Oh, okay.
[00:33:08.450] I guess that is like an important distinguisher as well. This is your legal partnership. Like nothing else is recognized. Yeah. Shirley's watching. Okay, dude. Imagine though, like you broke off your domestic partnership, but like you were still dating. That would really complicate things for the state, wouldn't it? Shirley's in shambles. Thank you. God, Michelle and Eric, no. No.
[00:33:39.030] She's like, what's going on with this relationship? It's like, it's only been six months. God, if Shirley ever hears this, she's going to be so proud, dude. So once you get married, does the like domestic partnership just resolve by itself? It just upgrades into a marriage. Yeah, right. I think that's, I think that's what happens. Like to be honest, I'm not a hundred percent sure. Like it like overrides? Yeah.
[00:34:07.790] Let's say that that's what happens. Yeah. Dude, maybe your paperwork will be easier because it's like, oh yeah, we're already legally bound. Now we just signed to be like, yep, we leveled up. Yeah. I like that. I like the leveling up. I know you guys said that it wasn't that big of a change for you guys, but it's still something like legal and somewhat ceremonial, I guess. Like having a notary there, he's kind of like your officiant. So did you guys like celebrate your legalization after you mailed off the papers and got the little document?
[00:34:36.930] Dude, literally no. Like literally nothing. Eric, right? We didn't. Everyone said we should have like a partnership party or a formation. Yeah. Yeah. Like what I texted people being like, yay, we got this sheet and people were like, congratulations. And I was like, thanks. Like I really, I did this for the health insurance and then we fucked up anyway. So it really like. Yeah.
[00:35:04.730] You guys didn't even like get a nice dinner together to celebrate all your hard work? Dude, literally no. No, it's, I'm just using Eric's. I was just, I was in it for the health insurance. Oh my God. I'm imagining Eric being like, let's go celebrate Michelle. You're like, no, we're good. No. That's why I'm so quiet right now. He's still recovering from the rejection. Dude, Eric, please. I heard us rushing back.
[00:35:33.990] Oh man. Oh, that's stupid. No, we didn't celebrate much. I don't think I've, you see, again, circling back to it. I didn't tell my, anybody at work that I did this. I guess people at work would probably be like, oh, congrats. Yeah. Like, what does that mean? Yeah. Also true. Also true. More questions. Yeah. I might've told my boss because I had to ask him about the health insurance. Oh. Yeah. But besides that, I don't think I really said much.
[00:36:03.110] And as we know, my boss doesn't say much. Yeah. He's a good person to tell. True. I think I like told our parents. We're like, it went through and they're like sick. And like, and then. Ooh, were your parents like awesome? So when are you getting married? Yeah. My parents were definitely like, wait, why don't you guys just get married? I'm like, do you? My parents also said that. Yeah. Because they didn't know what it meant either. They didn't. Right. Right. This is so easy.
[00:36:31.630] I get a piece of paper and then. No wedding reception. Yeah. No like huge money drops for a giant wedding or anything. I think it cost me like $33. Amazing. Wow. And I had to mail as a check to Shirley. Wait, pause for a sec. So Shirley actually collected money from you because you guys are in a relationship? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, Shirley must be making bank. Yeah.
[00:37:01.750] If everyone is just sending her $33. Dang. Jisoo's ready to be wed. Jisoo's like, I'm there. I don't know. Me, I'm just like, dude, I need to get my shit together before. Or I don't know. There's just something about partner to husband, wife. I don't know. There's, it's just, you know what? I don't even think it's the label. I think it's just like the expectation to have a big wedding. I want to have my shit together first. Yeah. I think that's fair. You got to feel ready for it.
[00:37:30.470] Like partner wise, me and Eric. Cool. We're good. Right, bud? But. I'm so sorry. Yeah. There's just other things in my life. Like I feel, I guess like mainly career wise that I need to like get together first before I'm ready to spend the money and like the time planning. Yeah. That makes sense. I get that. And I think also it's like a certain ladder you're climbing in terms of like, okay, first
[00:37:58.970] you get engaged and then married and then you have kids and it's like each step of the ladder, the pressures grow and like the expectations grow. So I totally know what you mean. Yeah. That's a, that's a good way of putting it to where it's like, especially since we've been together for so long too, it's like, I feel like people are expecting it. And also, you know, like you said, Crystal, like kind of in your late twenties and we're kind of entering that stage. So again, our decision to do this first was mostly just because I think both of us weren't
[00:38:27.490] like we're committed to each other, but we're not like mentally ready to have that step yet. And we're just weren't quite ready. And so here we are in this compromise or middle ground, if you will. But again, most of this talk really started because of the health insurance, like 100%. Like that was it. I mean, I feel like that makes total sense. And like a lot of people at our age who aren't trying to get married yet, they're just like, yeah, like it's not time yet.
[00:38:54.390] Like I'm not ready because certain other things need to get wrapped up first or whatever for you to, you're basically in the same boat, except you're like, okay, let's get health insurance together though. Right? Yeah. That's our step. That's yeah. That's in the ladder first. Do you guys ever get pressure to get married on paper first? And the reason why I ask is James and I moved in together right after college. So we were probably like 22, 23.
[00:39:23.430] We had also looked into a domestic partnership at the time because his company insurance was really cheap and mine was like at the time, very, very expensive. So I was like, maybe if we're domestic partners, I could just be on his health insurance, you know, as a partner or whatever and get cheaper health insurance. I had like a coworker at the time who was like campaigning for us to do it because she was in a domestic partnership. She was like, yo, this shit rocks. I'm on like two insurances now. I'm sick. Like I'm like fully covered. And I was like, oh shit.
[00:39:52.170] And we didn't end up doing it because it was more expensive for me to be on his plan for some reason. But I had floated this idea to my mom and I was like, I want to save money on insurance and we're like been together for a good chunk anyway. So what does it really matter? And she was like, yeah, I guess it doesn't really matter. Maybe you guys should just get married on paper first. And I was like, oh my God. But it's like a little early, but I feel like she wanted us to like sign up for it and like legalize it first. So I'm just curious if you guys had similar things from your parents.
[00:40:22.290] Eric, what do you think? Like my parents were two were just like, just get married. And then you, cause I'm always like, oh, money, money's a big thing. They're like, just have a party later. He he like, it's easy. Like, yeah, I agree. I think, uh, I think both of our parents, my parents definitely were said something along the lines of that too. I think once we explained to them how a domestic partnership works, they were a little bit more on board with it too. Dude, they're probably brainwashing themselves. Like, okay, they're basically just married.
[00:40:53.250] Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Oh, Jesus. I didn't know you, you had a domestic partnership too. So, you know, you know, the drill like with the notary. No, she almost did. Yeah. We like almost did it. Um, but we didn't end up doing it last minute, but I did have like a similar thought to what you were saying. I think Michelle of like, I was like, I feel like my parents don't know what this is. And maybe it's cause Korea has like good health insurance for everyone. So there's no need for this, you know, kind of like midpoint, I guess, between marriage
[00:41:22.710] and like single because everyone can just go to the pharmacy and get things for like $10 instead of like $800. I think the whole domestic partnership civil union was when same-sex couples, when same-sex marriage wasn't allowed, this was like the workaround. Yeah. Also for them to have kids. Was that right too, Michelle? For them to like adopt kids and stuff. All right.
[00:41:51.050] Well, I think that was a very fascinating discussion and very surprising to know that Jisoo, you also thought about it, but ultimately it makes a lot of sense. Um, I think especially for, we keep saying this, but like people are age kind of entering the engagement age range, but you know, some people aren't ready for it, but like you're already so committed that it's like, well, why can't we just get some of the benefits of being in like a super committed relationship when you know in the future, like a marriage
[00:42:19.930] is probably in sight. It's nice to know that there's options to like look out for that could be useful for you and your, for anyone in their long-term relationships.
