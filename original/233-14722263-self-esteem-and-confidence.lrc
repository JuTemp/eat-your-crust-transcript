[00:00:00.000]  Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal, I'm Jeesoo and I'm I.
[00:00:16.000]  Welcome back I, the last time she was on the podcast with us was episode 171 Relationship Self versus Single Self.
[00:00:26.000]  This one was a popular episode and I feel like we explored a lot of ourselves in this one.
[00:00:31.000]  So definitely check it out if you haven't listened to it already. And to start off this episode we have a Gen Z phrase of the week.
[00:00:41.000]  The phrase is, is blank in the room with us now. This one is pretty interesting.
[00:00:49.000]  At first, when I saw this, I thought this was some reference to an Eminem song or something.
[00:00:55.000]  I don't even know why that's a millennial statement.
[00:00:59.000]  I think I was thinking of what is it like who's the real slum shade here something?
[00:01:05.000]  Oh, I don't know why but that's what immediately were my mind when the first time I ever read this phrase.
[00:01:13.000]  But it is its own phrase and the meaning behind it is basically calling out, oh you claim that this thing is here but is it actually here?
[00:01:25.000]  Like I don't see it essentially. So I'm sorry that's like not the best explanation.
[00:01:30.000]  I feel like it's best understood when you see it being used out in the wild.
[00:01:36.000]  I guess like one example, very rudimentary example would be like someone's on TikTok and they're kind of doing story time.
[00:01:44.000]  My friends and I were doing this ball ball ball and people don't believe the story then they could comment like, oh are your friends in the room with us right now?
[00:01:54.000]  Yeah, I feel like another kind of example that I've seen is someone was doing some sort of remodeling project
[00:02:02.000]  and then she was like, I'm remodeling this fireplace to use some sort of like specific method.
[00:02:09.000]  Let's pretend it was called the wash method or some shit.
[00:02:12.000]  And then I guess the results of how the fireplace came out wasn't the wash method at all.
[00:02:17.000]  So then all the comments were like, is the wash method in the room with us right now?
[00:02:22.000]  Yeah, I think it's really funny because it really just calls out sometimes misused words or misdefined words
[00:02:30.000]  or even just bad takes sometimes.
[00:02:33.000]  But I was looking at the origin of this on KnowYourMeam.com, our favorite website.
[00:02:39.000]  And it says a possible origin of this can be dated back all the way to 2000 in season 11 of The Simpsons where Marge is interrogated by a panel of doctors
[00:02:54.000]  and after they hear her pray under her breath, the doctor is like, this God is he in the room right now?
[00:03:03.000]  Yeah, there's something so like horror movie-esque about the joke.
[00:03:10.000]  When they do the Ouija boards in horror movies, they're always kind of like, oh are you in the room with us right now?
[00:03:16.000]  Or something like that? So I wonder if it's based on that.
[00:03:19.000]  But we think because I'm always kind of recalling that horror movie sequence when someone says this,
[00:03:25.000]  it sort of reminds me of another line from horror movies which is, oh the call is coming from inside of the house.
[00:03:33.000]  Like do everyone people used to say that? That was more of when people were being hypocritical in their claims.
[00:03:38.000]  But I remember that one was pretty funny too.
[00:03:41.000]  I remember the movie that sparked that too. It's like some movie about the killer being inside the home.
[00:03:47.000]  But also for this phrase, I feel like I've only ever seen it in like comment form.
[00:03:52.000]  I've never heard someone say it in real life.
[00:03:55.000]  It's always just like comments kind of bagging on like the original poster.
[00:04:01.000]  I'm gonna look for the right opportunity now.
[00:04:04.000]  Not as I'm educated with these Gen Z terms.
[00:04:10.000]  Yeah, I agree though. I think this phrase is low key so funny, but I think it's most appropriate in like text form.
[00:04:18.000]  I feel like when you're texting someone too, it's like funny.
[00:04:21.000]  But then if someone were to say it in real life, maybe it might be too long.
[00:04:25.000]  As soon as they say is something and I'm like, oh they're gonna say the room with us right now.
[00:04:30.000]  And the joke is overall ready internally.
[00:04:33.000]  Okay, maybe I shouldn't try to find out for team.
[00:04:37.000]  We just say it hallow fast.
[00:04:40.000]  Is in the room with us right now?
[00:04:43.000]  Yeah, that was pretty good.
[00:04:45.000]  I got a practice.
[00:04:48.000]  Well, we'll try to see if for the rest of this episode,
[00:04:51.000]  I can slip in a is X in the room with us right now, a joke.
[00:04:55.000]  Okay, that's my challenge.
[00:04:58.000]  I'm pretty excited to jump into the topic today, which is self esteem and confidence.
[00:05:04.000]  I think these two are for the most parts synonymous, but I do kind of feel like there's a difference between the words a little bit.
[00:05:11.000]  So let's start by talking about what the difference is between self esteem and confidence to you guys.
[00:05:17.000]  I kind of view self esteem as how you view yourself and then confidence is like how much you believe in yourself, I guess.
[00:05:25.000]  So self esteem is more rooted in your identity maybe, and confidence is a little bit about how you perceive your ability to do stuff, you think.
[00:05:35.000]  I guess like self esteem is almost like your personal evaluation of yourself in my mind.
[00:05:41.000]  Yeah, confidence is like the way that you go about doing things or like how much you can muster up some belief in yourself.
[00:05:51.000]  Because I think like self esteem is maybe more long term overall and then confidence, sometimes you can like muster up some confidence to do something, but like it maybe isn't always consistently there.
[00:06:04.000]  Yeah, that resonates.
[00:06:06.000]  If we look at self esteem, the word self is there so it applies to your being versus confidence can be in a particular skill or something like that.
[00:06:17.000]  Yeah, there's something that seems a little bit more external about the word confidence to whether it's the way you are around other people or like how you feel about yourself around other people.
[00:06:28.000]  But self esteem feels like something that you may grapple with even when you're by yourself.
[00:06:33.000]  So then it feels like a lot more internal of a word definitely saying they're pretty similar though we're in like the same category.
[00:06:42.000]  So I just quickly googled the definitions of these terms and it says that self esteem is how we value and perceive ourselves.
[00:06:50.000]  And it's based on our opinions and beliefs about ourselves which can feel difficult to change.
[00:06:56.000]  Whereas confidence is a feeling of self assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities.
[00:07:05.000]  Yeah, I like that.
[00:07:06.000]  I definitely feel that the confidence is like a state of being versus like the self esteem is almost like a more physical group almost.
[00:07:15.000]  I think the definition was saying like beliefs and opinions about self.
[00:07:19.000]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:20.000]  I think like self esteem kind of has that deeper meaning sort of like essentially you have more of that like self reflection attached to self esteem versus confidence is similar to what we're talking about.
[00:07:33.000]  And it's similar to what I said just like a state of being I can agree with that.
[00:07:38.000]  Yeah, they probably influence each other though in different ways.
[00:07:42.000]  Like I feel like you can kind of fake confidence but self esteem you can't fake.
[00:07:49.000]  That's a good point.
[00:07:50.000]  I think in some ways I think of the word self esteem in like the phrases that it's most used in and I feel like a lot of the times people are like
[00:07:58.000]  that person's self esteem is low.
[00:08:00.000]  That's like one of the most common usages of the word that I can recall and it makes me kind of perceive self esteem as maybe like your friendship with yourself, you know, it's like do you actually like yourself or not because if your self esteem is low, then I feel like your relationship with yourself is maybe bad or like in the men's a little bit but if your self esteem is high.
[00:08:23.000]  Then no matter what external things happen, it doesn't change the way you see yourself or the way you believe in yourself.
[00:08:30.000]  I see it almost as how you treat yourself and how you choose to think of yourself.
[00:08:36.000]  I think I can agree with that kind of like what we said earlier, you can have confidence in like some of your abilities but that doesn't necessarily translate to having good self esteem.
[00:08:48.000]  Yeah, it's hard because it's almost like chicken and egg because when you think about when you feel confident about something there's an underlying belief to that.
[00:08:56.000]  Let's say you're confident at snowboarding.
[00:08:59.000]  So just let's go.
[00:09:01.000]  If your underlying belief is oh I'm good at this or like I'm good at learning this and that is kind of part of self esteem but it's obviously not encompassing every aspect of yourself.
[00:09:12.000]  Which is why I feel like they're very like tied together.
[00:09:15.000]  True, like the more self esteem you have the more whole your confidence is.
[00:09:21.000]  Yeah, like confidence in every area of yourself.
[00:09:25.000]  I guess you could start off small by building confidence in different areas of your life and skill set and then grow your self esteem through that potentially.
[00:09:37.000]  I think that makes sense.
[00:09:39.000]  I like the way I perceive it almost is confidence is sort of the positive side and then self esteem is almost the negative side.
[00:09:47.000]  And what I mean by that is confidence is always associated with something like strong that you have or something strong that you feel like, oh I'm having a good time feeling confident today or I feel confident about X Y and Z.
[00:09:58.000]  But then self esteem I feel like is the thing that supports you when the positive stuff goes away.
[00:10:03.000]  If you're having a bad day or if someone said to you, oh you're confident about the skill but I don't think you're good at it.
[00:10:10.000]  For example, then your self esteem would be the thing that backs you up and it's like, hey what the hell?
[00:10:14.000]  I am so good at it or even if this person thinks I'm bad at something that I'm confident about, I won't let it negatively affect the way I see myself sort of.
[00:10:23.000]  Yeah, I love that.
[00:10:25.000]  There's like self esteem, there's like self image, there's like different words to kind of describe this bucket of thing but definitely self esteem has like interesting connotation to the phrase.
[00:10:37.000]  Also what Jesus had earlier like self esteem is often used in a way to be like, oh maybe this person has low self esteem.
[00:10:46.000]  Like it's a little more on the negative side in terms of literal word usage.
[00:10:52.000]  And I can totally see that because sometimes when someone has high self esteem, instead of seeing self esteem we say like self confidence.
[00:11:00.000]  Yeah, self confidence also like self love is another thing but I feel like it's very similar.
[00:11:07.000]  I don't know self esteem.
[00:11:09.000]  Yeah, I feel like usually it is actually associated with the negative right now that I think about it.
[00:11:14.000]  Okay, well is there anything in particular you guys feel like helped grow your self love self esteem self confidence.
[00:11:22.000]  So for me I think I have a pretty interesting perception of the word self esteem because I feel like it was always something that I really struggled with.
[00:11:31.000]  I would definitely have moments and for long stretches of time too about feeling really confident but oftentimes those felt very temporary.
[00:11:41.000]  So then that's why to me self esteem is like an even bigger challenge than confidence because I think truly it's really hard at least in my experience to grow self esteem.
[00:11:52.000]  Sometimes I felt like I was growing just my confidence and then my self esteem bucket would still be not filled essentially.
[00:11:59.000]  So in the last I don't know like 20 years basically I felt like I was always kind of working on my self esteem and what finally helped in my eyes is honestly growing older.
[00:12:14.000]  I feel like it was something that no matter what I did felt impossible to grow or improve in my teenage years or even in college years.
[00:12:25.000]  And a lot of it is just I think in those years you're just constantly around or like forced to be around many people every single day who are exactly your peers exactly your age and you know competing for similar spots and stuff.
[00:12:40.000]  And it's just hard to really break out of that comparison mindset but now that I'm older, I have my own life and you kind of start to see how people's lives branch out and people succeed and thrive in different ways not just the one set standard path.
[00:12:57.000]  I feel like I have a lot less of a problem with myself esteem and I'm just so grateful to be living life as like a 27 year old woman because it's so much easier than being like a teenager or even like a college student aged woman, I think.
[00:13:15.000]  Yeah, I feel like I can definitely relate to age helping with self esteem and I think it's kind of similar to what you said G-Zoo where as you get older you see the different facets of like success and how it plays out differently for everyone.
[00:13:34.000]  And I think along those lines seeing myself succeed was also like a self esteem slash confidence booster.
[00:13:44.000]  Like seeing your hard work pay off ends up being pretty encouraging and I think you know taking those wins and really appreciating them is helpful because I think it's also very easy to succeed and then be like, okay yeah but that was expected.
[00:14:01.000]  And then you know it doesn't help self esteem at all or maybe it's like okay well that's just the baseline but it's like you know it's not always like that.
[00:14:08.000]  If you celebrate each win it just I feel like it's better than to always like put yourself down so I think that kind of helped me and there was definitely one thing that someone said that really affected me for a long time and I sometimes still think about it but I think it was like a tutor or something.
[00:14:29.000]  And this guy was like yeah I didn't really go through the conventional school path. He had to like take some years off of school and like all that kind of stuff just because of a personal or like family stuff.
[00:14:41.000]  And he was like yeah and I turned out fine so at you all the class he was like I believe that you're all hard working and like pretty smart people.
[00:14:52.000]  So I think that like even if you end up taking an untraditional route you'll all end up okay.
[00:14:58.000]  You seem like the type of people who had put in the work and really figure things out for yourself.
[00:15:03.000]  So that was like very encouraging and I think it left a deep impression on me because I was like wow this person like really believes in us and also this person is living proof of success in a less traditional path.
[00:15:19.000]  Wow that's some good parenting right there.
[00:15:23.000]  Damn but they weren't even my parents.
[00:15:26.000]  It was the tutor.
[00:15:28.000]  For me it's like a very internal thing and it stems from my meditation practice and kind of all the personal development stuff that I consume in practice.
[00:15:39.000]  I feel like I have made a lot of hard decisions in the last few years including like changing careers completely, quitting my nine to five, starting a business.
[00:15:50.000]  And those are all put me in spaces where the limiting beliefs come up right and those are like thoughts that are low confidence and low self esteem.
[00:16:03.000]  And I really have to notice them day to day and shift them essentially.
[00:16:08.000]  And I kind of know that this will never end because I know that I will never be satisfied with like the status quo.
[00:16:16.000]  There's this thing called like the terror barrier that Bob Proctor talks about and every time like you said a really high goal, you're going to hit this barrier because it's going against everything that you believe yourself to be right for example right now I'm starting a creative studio.
[00:16:32.000]  I've been in this industry for maybe one year like actually it's like a game and XR creative studio.
[00:16:40.000]  So I'm hitting a lot of limiting beliefs, I don't have enough skills, I have no idea how to do this like how am I going to land any clients like all this kind of stuff.
[00:16:50.000]  So in the future if I'm launching my own product or like fundraising money, there's always going to be a higher barrier which is why it's really important for me to be able to notice those thoughts that are you know channeling into self esteem and confidence and then changing them.
[00:17:08.000]  And it was interesting when you brought up like that high school example because I recently like went to and finished grad school right and I felt feelings I haven't felt since like college basically because it was the exact same environment of we're all doing like different but very similar things in interactive media art.
[00:17:26.000]  And it was kind of this like little bubble right and now I'm doing a residency where you know there's like around 100 of us but I'm probably one of the like very few people like five people who are like early stages of their art career.
[00:17:39.000]  So again, it's a lot of that imposter syndrome and thoughts of like oh I'm not as accomplished not as good as these people that I need to change.
[00:17:48.000]  It's a very moment to moment thing. I think it's crazy because like when I was in my marketing career, I never experienced imposter syndrome ever but now I have so many more times.
[00:18:00.000]  I think it's because I'm actually doing something I care about yeah and it's just like wow then like wow people have this feeling it sucks terrible.
[00:18:08.000]  I hate being not confident.
[00:18:11.000]  Oh my god yeah, I think also another layer to art in particular is that it's pretty subjective so sometimes it's easy to be like oh shoot like I have no idea what people would think about this because it's like a little more on the subjective side.
[00:18:29.000]  Yeah, you really have to like know yourself essentially and I think also love the process for you to like be in the field and kind of like shift that mindset from like outcome oriented to like process oriented.
[00:18:42.000]  So there's like a lot of little I think things and techniques that I've used.
[00:18:48.000]  Like when you're put in a situation where it's very easy to compare yourself to other people that's when your self esteem is like truly challenged.
[00:18:56.000]  And one of the reasons why I feel like it's gone better for me now that I'm removed from school is you can't really compare your life to someone else's in your late 20s I think because you definitely can when you're like 18 right like you compare the college that you're going to to the college that someone else is going to essentially.
[00:19:16.000]  In your late 20s I feel like everyone starts to kind of hone in on their biggest priorities in life and what they value and everyone has a different value set than other people right so then I feel like now at this age when I see someone else who's.
[00:19:31.000]  Say more successful in their career for example, I am not necessarily like wildly jealous of that anymore and I'm more so like oh well I curated maybe these other things or I really wanted to prioritize these other things in my life.
[00:19:45.000]  So then that's why my life is different from this other persons for example. It's no longer like a one to one comparison which makes it so much easier but I can totally see how in grad school or in residency where it's almost like a direct competition kind of environment those feelings would stir up again.
[00:20:03.000]  That's like a great mindset to have though and I would want to channel more of that in my own life I think taking like a more non-traditional route.
[00:20:13.000]  I see a lot of my creative friends I think struggle with sort of like especially like the Asian ones you know like don't have a normal job we're not married, don't have kids.
[00:20:23.000]  Yeah and I think kind of along this line of comparing yourself less with people around you. I think I kind of noticed that it felt better to not compare myself to other people as I was like growing up and going through high school and college so I kind of embraced that a little bit where I was like oh okay well maybe it's better that I don't you know just do what everyone else is doing mindlessly I guess especially when I knew that I have a lot of experience with my life and I'm not really happy about that.
[00:20:51.000]  I guess especially when I knew that I had an interest in a different subject then like you know what our parents want us to do or like what the typical Asian American stem route is.
[00:21:04.000]  So I think I kind of embraced that and it felt good because one else like oh this is kind of nice because there's less pressure around me because there's less people to directly compare myself with or even like have other people compare me with.
[00:21:19.000]  And then also it was like oh well I like doing this too so focusing on that joy helps reduce like constantly beating yourself up over like comparisons and things like that.
[00:21:30.000]  Yeah I think that's really key like the emotional aspect of it right like when I have a thought I see its impact on my emotional state and that's how I know if it's benefiting me or not benefiting me because you know when you're in that comparison mind that obviously does not feel good and not feeling good.
[00:21:48.000]  I mean there's so many things that not feeling good. That's the impact on but for first and foremost you probably want to be happier.
[00:21:58.000]  So making that choice of like being proud yourself no matter what the outcome is I think it's like a combination of those little choices that you make that overall changed your general emotional outlook and self esteem.
[00:22:11.000]  And I feel like on the flip side too it's also what kind of big choices that you make as well so like every day you kind of choose what sort of thoughts filter into your head and what you choose to keep and give power to.
[00:22:25.000]  But I feel like if the big actions that you make or the big choices that you make in life are also choices that you are happy to make or that you choose to make to show up for yourself or do something for yourself.
[00:22:37.000]  Then I feel like yourself esteem grows significantly more than if you're kind of letting yourself get pulled one direction or another without your own choice in it basically.
[00:22:49.000]  So then I feel like it really is a combination of the big actions and like the daily small choices.
[00:22:55.000]  Yeah totally in personal development slash manifestation I suppose there's like thoughts emotions and then the action like without action nothing will actually manifest but a lot of times what drives the action is the emotions and the thoughts so it's like all very interconnected right.
[00:23:13.000]  And as you continue to make the actions that are supporting the new emotions and thoughts and beliefs that you want to think and believe and feel then you start changing your life and becoming this person who is more confident and has more self esteem.
[00:23:28.000]  Another thing that I think has helped me is having very short term goals as in like probably still having some long term goals but really focusing on the now what can I do now.
[00:23:41.000]  So like I was saying taking that action and then celebrating the small wins and then before you know it you kind of reach that long term goal versus like if you're always just focus on the long term goal and like what's not awaiting for you in the future.
[00:23:58.000]  Then it's a constant battle right cuz you're like oh when will I achieve this big huge goal versus like i'm so proud of myself.
[00:24:07.000]  I like did this today and it's bringing me one step closer to this bigger goal that I haven't mind so I think really shifting your mindset there to focus on the smaller what can I do now things versus always looking into like not now so like the future or whatever.
[00:24:25.000]  I think that's a really good point it's like setting yourself up many success milestones so that you're constantly sort of relishing and that feeling of success instead of the binary of like no I haven't achieved my goal this entire time and then yes I have achieved my goal.
[00:24:40.000]  I love that and I even do that like on a daily basis with the smallest things if I met you today like fuck yeah i'm so proud of myself.
[00:24:50.000]  Or like you know if I stretch for 10 minutes then like let's go that's something that I did today and I think like really focusing on the daily things and like also okay in this moment like what are the choices i'm making that.
[00:25:02.000]  I am taking care of myself with or are making me happy those are really important choices too so celebrating those as well and like something i've been doing lately just thinking about what i'm actually doing every day that's making me happy versus what i'm thinking is making me happy.
[00:25:18.000]  Which a lot of times is connected to this long term future projected goals.
[00:25:25.000]  Yeah you know which is like a clear way to be unhappy is to constantly feel that gap between where you are now and where you are in the future.
[00:25:34.000]  Exactly it's like it's always easier said than done though because it's kind of like the idea of worrying constantly you're like you're worrying about something in the future and you can't really do anything about it now except worry.
[00:25:47.000]  But like it's hard to let go of that sometimes you have to be like really vigilant of those thoughts that are making you unhappy and I remember like last semester i was like doing my thesis not semester last year.
[00:26:01.000]  I was doing my thesis project and I felt like so much just like stressing anxiety at one point i was just like dude i don't know give a shit about my project anymore like i just need to be happy.
[00:26:12.000]  And like it was that kind of moment of extreme discomfort and dissatisfaction that push me into a new direction so i think that happens to a lot of people a lot of times it's called like the dark night of the soul where you finally decide to make a different decision for yourself.
[00:26:28.000]  I like that and i think that makes a lot of sense too because it's like the turning point or something that's like snapping you out of it you're like wait what am i even doing here like i don't care about this.
[00:26:40.000]  Yeah totally.
[00:26:42.000]  I mean ideally you start to change before that happens.
[00:26:46.000]  But sometimes you can't help but to get there.
[00:26:50.000]  Yeah exactly us humans in our silly patterns actually so i've been trying this new thing recently where just become completely like delusional almost and is a really funny and like fun technique.
[00:27:04.000]  I don't want to say pretend to become someone else I need to like become someone else so like for example i was like surfing and i don't know why i'm just eating so much shit for like a full hour and a half into my surf session.
[00:27:18.000]  And i was observing my thoughts right and they were just so negative i was like man everyone's look at me i'm so embarrassed like i've surfed so many times before i do not know what is happening am i even going to catch a wave today like all this shit.
[00:27:31.000]  And then all of a sudden i'm like dude i cannot this energy is why i am not catching a wave so i literally pretended i was a pro surfer and i look at people and i'm like i'm better than you i'm better than you.
[00:27:44.000]  Like you suck like i'm a pro surfer like i literally just started repeating those thoughts in my head instead to like flip right because i just like cannot say that negative energy for anymore and i kid you not within the next like 10 minutes i figured out why i was eating shit and then i like caught most of the ways after that.
[00:28:04.000]  And that was just like kind of a crazy experience for me of like holy shit when i'm in this negative mind state or like tying it back to confidence and self-esteem when i'm in this like negative confidence state like i cannot see a new path forward when i switch my mindset to becoming a pro surfer.
[00:28:25.000]  There's obviously a problem that i need to solve here with my serving like it's not because i suck i just have some sort of like wrong technique right.
[00:28:32.000]  Boom saw like two women with like same size surfboard same size as me realize i was too forward on my surfboard it was such an easy thing to solve after that.
[00:28:42.000]  So since that experience i've been like trying it with a lot of different things and it's been really fun actually just like being like delusional but self-aware that you're being delusional.
[00:28:53.000]  It's like your brainwashing yourself kind of yeah basically you're just becoming a different person.
[00:29:02.000]  Yeah essentially i think i've actually done similar things too and some of it is from survival mode so like recently i went skiing and i was going down this bloom that blue was probably like the hardest course that i had skewed that weekend going down it i had to like if i wanted to make it down in one piece i had to like talk myself through it
[00:29:22.000]  So then i was like okay i can do this i can do this like you're not going to die the worst is you're going to fall just turn here like i was literally like coaxing myself down the mountain essentially.
[00:29:31.000]  And then i was like holy shit this is crazy growth for me because one of the things that my therapist had first said to me when we started our sessions together was she was like i don't know why you talked to yourself like that and i was like oh what do you mean she's like anytime you describe yourself or like talk about yourself.
[00:29:47.000]  You use such negative words and i feel like it really puts you in the state of self-defense or kind of like putting yourself down and she's like it's going to render you like immobile basically so like you have to kind of talk to yourself like a friend.
[00:30:00.000]  And then i realized that maybe the therapy is fucking working because you know me seeing down this mountain pre therapist i feel like i would have been like oh my god i can't do this i'm gonna cry i can't do this like this is so hard.
[00:30:13.000]  Why did James or whoever like take me down the mountain but now i was like able to kind of talk myself through it like i would a friend.
[00:30:21.000]  So then i feel like there is oftentimes like a power towards and a power to the attitude because negativity like you said i could like totally blind you and it could block you from being like even just baseline rational essentially.
[00:30:35.000]  Totally once you notice that voice in your head you're like oh wait actually i don't see with you.
[00:30:41.000]  You're like shut up.
[00:30:43.000]  You're like wait pause i actually i don't want to think that about myself or like about like situations about other people so i think yeah it's a moment of self awareness and then deciding like okay i'm actually going to like treat myself differently or perceive myself in a different way and that will make a huge huge difference.
[00:31:04.000]  Yeah i'm reflecting on like my personal inner voice and i think i have this funny thing where sometimes in like more dire or tense situations i actually talk to myself in second person.
[00:31:18.000]  So it's more like oh it's all good crystal like we can do this we'll pull through and i feel like that kind of helps sometimes because it's like oh shit we're a team but it's actually just me.
[00:31:30.000]  Yeah i love that you are a team with your inner being.
[00:31:36.000]  It gives a sense of like togetherness maybe like oh actually i'm not in this by myself although you totally are but like you know just that like you said the power words it feels more yeah we got this like let's go through this.
[00:31:52.000]  Personally i believe in higher self which is like your divine version of yourself that's like always guiding you so like when you were talking about talking yourself in like second person i was thinking about that.
[00:32:05.000]  Like you acting as your higher self guiding your human self perhaps to a better place.
[00:32:12.000]  Alright i like that more.
[00:32:14.000]  It makes total sense though like i also refer to myself in the second person sometimes and then it just makes sense because i me right but then i feel like myself like that one is like a different part of me like it's not the same thing as me itself like the person who's talking.
[00:32:32.000]  But i feel like there are two different things sometimes it almost feels like my body is like a tomagotchi or something i need to control i'm just like the avatar in my physical vessel and i need to like do stuff to like make sure it goes out and get some sun or get some exercise or drink water so it's kind of funny to think about it in that way.
[00:32:52.000]  Oh god that is funny see now we're getting real spiritual.
[00:32:56.000]  Are we really dude all those games in our childhood tomagotchi like the 10 dogs it was just training us to take care of ourselves in the future.
[00:33:06.000]  Oh my gosh what do you think are like your biggest maybe triggers or like obstacles that make you feel low self esteem.
[00:33:18.000]  My bouts of low self esteem typically come from one thing so i have always kind of grappled with feeling low self esteem about my weight and that's been like an ongoing journey like my entire life and i don't think it's exclusive to me like i think it's relatively common especially for a lot of women when you know the arrow we grew up there were always those magazine covers up like this person gained weight you know like this person looks fat so i'm like i'm not sure if i'm going to get a shot or not.
[00:33:46.000]  Like this person looks fat so then i think a lot of that negative association with our weight was kind of maybe built into our childhood in a sense but anytime i have weight fluctuations for example it really messes with my self esteem.
[00:34:02.000]  And this actually kind of goes both ways so i feel like there's times where i wake up and i feel very thin and i'm like oh my god i often call those days like my Kanye days or like you know i'm like in my Kanye era
[00:34:15.000]  and the times where i feel really confident about my body but there are of course times where i wake up and i don't feel that way so then i think those things always kind of shake up my confidence and it's really tough to kind of break it i think like break this mentality
[00:34:32.000]  and i think i actually have made some really big strides over the last couple of years but it i think stems from trying not to hold negative thoughts about my character based on how the numbers of my weight looks like or based on how my body looks like.
[00:34:50.000]  Everyone can have weight fluctuations and everyone can have times where they feel more confident in their physical appearance but that doesn't mean on days where i feel low confidence in my physical appearance i'm like a shitty person you know i always just need to like make that line in between those things but of course it's definitely hard.
[00:35:10.000]  yeah i feel like that's such a common insecurity that a lot of people have especially because our world is so people always try to kind of like cover up but like i think our society is very very like externally you know like physically driven or physical looks driven we can't help it sometimes because that's kind of just like what we see right and then based off that.
[00:35:38.000]  it's just really easy to go down the path of like making judgments or you know not seeing the full picture but like jumping to conclusions and i feel like it messes with a lot of people especially like if you think about how there's so many like filters on social media and people have been kind of calling it out more and more where they're like oh my god some of these filters are insane like people just fucking wake up put on a filter they don't even have to like you know i just make some look perfect.
[00:36:08.000]  that's just so unreal but that's what people end up seeing and then it creates like all this like potential dysmorphia and stuff it's like it's such a crazy thing and i feel like it's definitely like very understandable to have fluctuating self esteem in regards to that i feel like also a big theme is like a lot of Asian Americans with immigrant parents they all kind of share a similar value of skininess among like woman is better.
[00:36:38.000]  especially and i feel like that kind of fucks with us too from a young age i think we talked about it before on the podcast where parents are sometimes like oh my god like you got fatter or like oh i can tell you gained weight like you need to be skinnier but then like the next day they're like you'll eat more and you're like what the fuck do you want me to do.
[00:36:59.000]  while y'all were talking i was just thinking about like the specific triggers that like influence that and i think like media is a huge one which is why i don't fuck with like so i don't fuck with like instagram and tiktok especially because i feel like that part of self-man is really heavily perpetuated on that and i i immediately can feel the influence on it like day to day you know and i've also had that those moments of like waking up and just feeling like it's a skinny day or like.
[00:37:29.000]  not so skinny day or whatever and like how i'm perceiving that as like good or bad and i'm like whoa what's happening or the matrix you know just like it's like crazy because those thoughts are formed by these like triggers and things that we see in society right.
[00:37:49.660]  and it's not actually me thinking that again so i think like removing those media sources for my life has really really really helped me a lot.
[00:37:59.900]  and also just like realizing when i do look at myself in the mirror and think those thoughts it does not fucking feel good like i can feel it straight in my body.
[00:38:09.860]  i'm like really hyper aware of my emotions and the feelings by body and i know that is like to the exact like detriment of it.
[00:38:20.420]  so in those moments i really try to shift and like i'm obviously not perfect at it but i'm grateful that i have that awareness now of like oh shit i just.
[00:38:31.340]  thought the start of me not looking great looking in the mirror and now i feel pit in my stomach like wow that sucks like i don't want to be like i don't want to live my life that way essentially.
[00:38:42.860]  yeah there's actually a lot of really interesting things that i feel like have felt small in the moment but have really changed the way that i look at food and like.
[00:38:51.700]  appearance and things like that one of it is something that i sometimes struggle with is like binge eating so you know there those.
[00:39:00.100]  weeks where maybe you're really good about eating all week and.
[00:39:03.620]  I don't want to fix like a value to how well someone eats but let's say i was eating pretty healthy so like chicken breast and salad and whatnot but there are also those moments where i'm like okay i just want to eat chips and like ice cream and cookies for example.
[00:39:18.820]  so i used to look at those moments and be like oh why the fuck did i eat so much or like why did i do that and it would be like a purely negative.
[00:39:27.780]  moment for me it would almost be like a moment of weakness but a couple months ago james said something like oh i read this study that.
[00:39:36.020]  after you you know say binge or like eat a lot of carbs or something you have like a really good workout the next day.
[00:39:42.860]  and then i feel like something so simple like that just like completely transformed the ways that i see like those quote unquote.
[00:39:49.260]  moments of weakness where i was like i don't have to see this as like.
[00:39:53.580]  Oh why did i binge eat like i shouldn't have done that this was so horrible and shameful i can just see it as like okay well i kind of indulge last night but now i'm going to have like a really good workout at the gym and this is like fuel for my body.
[00:40:04.900]  and it seems so simple but i feel like it completely changed the way that i look at.
[00:40:10.100]  food it changed the way that i look at my like late night cravings and.
[00:40:14.860]  it helps me not like ruin an entire day anymore.
[00:40:19.460]  i like so you saw the belief that was making you feel like shit and then you changed it right.
[00:40:25.340]  it's like so simple but also like not you know like you really have to notice those moments of like.
[00:40:35.100]  right and i think in how is that making me feel or how is influencing my life and then like what can i change it to.
[00:40:42.220]  and i feel like also when you look at it the next day and you're like oh my god why do this it's.
[00:40:48.780]  in a way taking away from your happy moment earlier to because i'm sure when you're eating the chips you're like oh my god this is fucking delicious like i'm so glad i ate this cuz i really wanted to right.
[00:40:59.820]  and then the next day are like oh shame on me um like i shouldn't have done that maybe um like recognizing that you're taking away or like you're.
[00:41:09.660]  almost shaming yourself for being happy is like.
[00:41:13.740]  the thing that you need to change.
[00:41:16.380]  yeah i think that's a good point i feel like a lot of times there's just like moments in life
[00:41:21.180]  i think one thing that was causing me like really bad anxiety was the way that i was changing those moments.
[00:41:28.460]  and chaining them to like mean something like oh i did this and then i did this so therefore it must mean that.
[00:41:35.180]  mean x about my character or it means that i have no work at the or it means i have no you know self control or whatever.
[00:41:41.900]  but i feel like you don't always have to.
[00:41:43.900]  affects some sort of like meaning to things like things can just live in like the bubble in the moment
[00:41:49.180]  and it doesn't have to be like a whole chain of like okay this sequence of five events means that i'm
[00:41:55.260]  this kind of a person i feel like it doesn't have to be so deep sometimes yeah for sure i think that
[00:42:01.180]  really will fuck you up.
[00:42:04.300]  and like going through a career change and like working kind of in a new career i've definitely had
[00:42:09.820]  that's moments where i feel like you know an outcome is from a result of like a personal character
[00:42:16.940]  by realize that's entirely not true and because i'm going to like believe that it's not true right.
[00:42:24.220]  so really i think is a decision to to not associate those external events to your internal
[00:42:30.940]  character.
[00:42:33.180]  i feel like it's still pretty hard though sometimes i still wake up in a cold sweat i'm like
[00:42:37.580]  fuck why did i do that shit 10 years ago.
[00:42:41.420]  well what if you believed it was easy?
[00:42:44.220]  i guess that's true.
[00:42:46.060]  what feels better believing that it's hard or believing that it's easy?
[00:42:51.340]  that's what i'm saying everything is a mind game y'all
[00:42:54.700]  and you got to master your own mind game.
[00:42:57.020]  that's a good point i feel like something that's helped me a lot too is like joking about things
[00:43:02.460]  or just like trying to take things in a very lighthearted way.
[00:43:05.580]  like i feel like things that used to feel so cringe and heavy to me like once i joke about it
[00:43:10.940]  it's just like a funny story.
[00:43:12.780]  now instead of being like oh god i'm such an awkward and cringe person i'm like oh this is
[00:43:17.100]  like another memory i could add to like the story bank of funny stories and it makes things
[00:43:22.300]  heal so much less heavy.
[00:43:23.900]  how comedians are born?
[00:43:25.900]  oh my god
[00:43:27.980]  future comedian
[00:43:30.220]  just working on my set.
[00:43:33.340]  can't wait for you to join Netflix.
[00:43:36.700]  oh yeah
[00:43:37.820]  so then do you guys think that having i guess varying levels of confidence in the day-to-day
[00:43:43.900]  is normal and i guess to what extent does it feel normal to have these swings?
[00:43:49.020]  yeah i feel like it's pretty normal for sure i think confidence can fluctuate depending on
[00:43:56.220]  like what i'm doing in the moment because kind of like i said in the beginning i associate
[00:44:01.180]  confidence more in specific areas versus like the whole.
[00:44:06.540]  so i think if i'm doing something new sometimes i have a little bit less confidence but there is
[00:44:12.860]  the kind of thing that you said gc as well earlier in the episode where like yourself
[00:44:17.420]  esteem backs you up where it's like oh shoot you know i don't know anything about this but
[00:44:22.700]  you know i believe in myself i think i'll be able to catch on so i think like it's pretty normal
[00:44:27.740]  to have like confidence fluctuate depending on what activity you're doing.
[00:44:32.780]  i think there's like seasons for sure but the important part is what we talked earlier
[00:44:37.820]  like how do you kind of combat it or how do you like regain that confidence and that self-esteem
[00:44:44.300]  and that makes all the difference.
[00:44:46.780]  so essentially the recoverability i guess?
[00:44:50.140]  yeah the recoverability of your confidence.
[00:44:54.620]  oh this is kind of silly maybe but i think this can really show sometimes in like gaming
[00:45:01.740]  so one interesting thing i saw was in this one game this professional team they actually have a
[00:45:08.300]  psychologist for their team who helps hype them up he's essentially kind of like their hype man
[00:45:15.420]  so in between like these matches or rounds or whatever let's say like they lose the first one
[00:45:21.260]  the psychologist comes in during the team huddle and he's like hey guys i know we lost that game
[00:45:26.860]  but you're doing so well like you're hitting all your shots the calls that you're making are amazing
[00:45:32.780]  but the other team just kind of outstratigized us this time but like keep a smile on your face like
[00:45:38.460]  remember you're so good stop thinking about the other team beating you think more like oh i'm so
[00:45:44.220]  good like focus more on yourself versus like these external things and then after he did that in
[00:45:49.180]  like the most recent tournament they literally came back and they won the next two matches to win
[00:45:54.140]  like the best two out of three so i thought that was like really powerful to see
[00:45:59.340]  yeah the mindset is so key and i think esports and like regular athletes and i heard like one of
[00:46:04.860]  the reasons tennis is really difficult is because you can't talk to like a coach on the on the court
[00:46:11.260]  so like it just goes to show like how much of a mental game like everything is
[00:46:16.380]  i think the faster your confidence recovery time is the easier time you'll have in life
[00:46:22.300]  probably probably yeah yeah like think about it if like someone says something negative about you
[00:46:28.140]  or like you make a mistake at work think about the difference it would be if it took you a few weeks
[00:46:35.180]  to bounce back versus a few days versus a couple of hours those three instances are completely
[00:46:41.740]  different people essentially true and you're gonna be making different decisions in each of those
[00:46:46.300]  scenarios going back to esports if you lost that first match and then you felt unsure about your
[00:46:52.540]  decisions the play would be different because you'd be taking different types of risks in those
[00:46:57.420]  situations yeah exactly and i feel like this can totally apply to just like regular day-to-day stuff
[00:47:03.980]  too like you don't have to be a pro at anything to like you know try to change this mindset sometimes
[00:47:10.380]  if i'm playing games with friends and then we just like lose a bunch of games we're kind of like okay
[00:47:15.660]  you know it let's just like step away for tonight like that's good for tonight we'll do a mental
[00:47:19.420]  resale play again tomorrow we'll be happy no need to like try to chase that win oh my god actually
[00:47:26.220]  this has happened to us in college me jisu and our other college friends sometimes we would play like
[00:47:32.540]  league we'd be like oh shoo we keep losing like we can't end on a loss like we have to keep playing
[00:47:38.140]  to you but sometimes like you're just on a like losing streak and you just can't help it right so
[00:47:45.100]  sometimes we would end up playing until like five a.m. or something and we're just like oh man
[00:47:50.940]  like why do we do that yeah in the end it's like oh why do we do that we could have easily
[00:47:56.700]  just like stepped away and just had a great time the next day there's this woman called abraham
[00:48:02.460]  hicks um and she talks about like how you have like negative momentum and pause the momentum
[00:48:09.740]  and when you have negative momentum and you can literally like you can't stop those feelings of
[00:48:14.540]  negativity or those thoughts and negativity she's like yo just like go to fucking bed you know
[00:48:18.700]  tomorrow's a new day yeah sometimes it's just too hard to stop that negative momentum
[00:48:24.460]  no for real like just don't like tomorrow you will actually feel better so I felt like that was
[00:48:30.780]  a really good example of that oh my god yes i think that is so true like honestly it's okay to stop
[00:48:36.860]  sometimes and just be like let me just take a reset like a break or whatever true this is not the
[00:48:42.940]  momentum and i think that applies to thoughts also when you're in like this crazy like spiral
[00:48:48.620]  or like negative thought mindset sometimes it's really hard to shift that and it's better should
[00:48:53.340]  just do something to completely take it off your mind right or to just sleep it off go to bed
[00:48:59.740]  and realize that like tomorrow you can like start a new with these feelings and thoughts of like
[00:49:05.740]  self-esteem and confidence yeah like sometimes even at work if i'm feeling like really confused
[00:49:13.820]  or like down about a project or something i'll just be like fuck it like i'll just take an early
[00:49:18.780]  lunch you know just like go distract myself feel happy after eating then come back and be like okay
[00:49:25.020]  well you know restart this or whatever totally i feel like sometimes when i'm in that negative
[00:49:30.940]  thought spiral though i'll like have a conversation with james and then i realized like how bad the
[00:49:35.740]  spiral was it really truly takes like an external source for me personally because i'm kind of like
[00:49:41.180]  an external thinker i have to be able to bounce my ideas off of someone recently i was having this
[00:49:46.700]  negative thought spiral about something at work and i was like oh my god can't believe this happened
[00:49:50.860]  what am i gonna do you know and i was just kind of going down this list of this person will be
[00:49:55.660]  negatively affected and like this will happen and this is like a whole list of like negative things
[00:50:00.540]  essentially and james was like dude who cares like mistakes happen all the time other people make
[00:50:05.900]  mistakes you make mistakes it's like completely normal and it doesn't have to negatively affect
[00:50:11.260]  your like personal life basically like we're like negatively affect the way you see yourself as a person
[00:50:16.940]  i feel like when i talk to someone really positive i'm always like mind blown by the way that
[00:50:21.100]  they're able to think about life because with james specifically i mean you guys know so well but
[00:50:26.300]  we've talked about on this podcast about how he celebrates his wins really big and he's like not very
[00:50:33.180]  impacted by the losses that he goes through in life that's something that i try to think about a lot
[00:50:38.060]  like i'm always trying to channel like my inner male energy in the sense of like how do a guy go
[00:50:43.820]  about oh my gosh so i talked about this with my friend all the time because we have this mutual
[00:50:48.940]  friend we're both like Asian women and we have this white male friend and he's just so damn confident
[00:50:55.260]  we're like holy shit this is how he gets things like things that he wants in his life and we're always
[00:51:00.540]  like yo we got a channel his energy let's be white men no no inner white men yeah we are inner white
[00:51:09.580]  wait i saw the funniest tiktok the other day which is kind of in line with this this girl she asks
[00:51:15.340]  like oh what would you wish for if there was a genie but you can't wish for like more money
[00:51:21.500]  and then this one girl was like oh i would wish for whatever i wanted to happen to happen
[00:51:27.260]  basically right and then everyone's like oh that's pretty good and then her friend suddenly goes
[00:51:31.660]  oh wait no like there's one problem like don't you sometimes wish that you were dead that would happen
[00:51:37.020]  right and then she was like no like i've never thought about that i was like wait that's so crazy
[00:51:45.020]  all the comments were like why did i relate to the friend who said what if you wish you were dead
[00:51:50.540]  and not the one who was like so innocently like i've never thought that before
[00:51:54.940]  oh my god dude but yeah the fucking white male energy is hard to beat like i've worked with some
[00:52:01.660]  pretty interesting people but i try to look at like their qualities of like what put them in that
[00:52:08.860]  place and a lot of times it's just straight up like confidence like can you not it's not even like
[00:52:14.540]  how good they are at their job it's literally because they like believe that they can and i'm like
[00:52:20.540]  i know and it's totally that mindset of like i've never understood when people are like oh if you
[00:52:27.100]  want something just like ask for it i'm like what do you mean like that goes against every fiber of
[00:52:31.820]  my fucking being oh my god but then i feel like in professional settings or just in life on
[00:52:37.580]  fucking linked infeeds you see that manifestation or like you see what that does for people and i'm
[00:52:43.660]  like maybe i should just do that like just ask for shit that i want crazy idea but i think a lot
[00:52:49.900]  of it comes back down to like truly that like self esteem or like confidence or the way you
[00:52:56.140]  see yourself or the way you see what you deserve almost it's like there's this phrase in
[00:53:00.860]  Korean where it talks about like your kudit which is like your dish it's like your dish is really big
[00:53:06.220]  which means you're like able to receive things or like you're able to like receive or like call out
[00:53:12.140]  or like handle bigger things if you're like dishes bigger and i feel like i need to constantly
[00:53:18.140]  think about like making my dish bigger and bigger i really like that phrase slash analogy
[00:53:25.260]  because it's so true like if you don't believe your worthy of it then you're not gonna get it right
[00:53:29.500]  even if someone hands it to you on a platter you're gonna be like oh shit i can't handle this or like
[00:53:34.300]  oh wait i'm actually not good enough for this and like you're gonna push it away so i feel like
[00:53:38.700]  a lot of the core is working on like yourself worthiness yeah oh my god i attended this woman's
[00:53:45.340]  panel at work once and they talked about how a lot of women see a job description and they want
[00:53:53.340]  to feel like they fulfill 90 to 100 percent of the job description before they apply but men
[00:54:02.700]  see like 10 percent and they're like okay i'm applying oh my god yeah or it's like some crazy
[00:54:06.940]  like low number you know and they'll just be like okay you know what i have like one or two of these
[00:54:11.820]  things so fuck i'll just apply and so on that panel they were like yeah we encourage you to think
[00:54:16.460]  of more like men like fuck it dude just apply so true like channel your inner white man
[00:54:24.860]  but it is so fucking true holy shit i guess that is like generations of destroying our self-esteem
[00:54:34.380]  yeah totally time for that reversal yeah
[00:54:37.340]  yeah
[00:54:38.380]  sometimes when i'm in those moments of like hesitation of like oh do i ask for this or do not or like
[00:54:44.380]  do i you know talk to this person or not i think of like the people in my life who are super
[00:54:51.100]  confident and if they would do it or not and how they would approach it go like okay if i'm this
[00:54:55.660]  person like how would i go about it and that is super helpful because removing what i think of myself
[00:55:02.780]  from the situation and being like who is like someone that i admire or that i would
[00:55:08.460]  want to be in terms of confidence like what would they do in that situation
[00:55:12.460]  ultimately if i want to get there like i would have to do the same thing you know
[00:55:17.260]  it takes a bit of time to i think cultivate that readiness but like once you do reach that point
[00:55:23.820]  like it's up to you to take that action for sure that's that's like such a crazy concept
[00:55:29.100]  i think i do something similar where i'm like what would this person do but i never thought about
[00:55:33.900]  it as a way of like removing myself from the situation and it's really interesting because
[00:55:39.660]  it kind of to me points to like how much we or at least i let myself or the way that i perceive
[00:55:47.660]  myself like guide my decisions but when you think about it like the difference between you and
[00:55:53.900]  like the person that you respect the most is not that big i mean yes like the cultural background
[00:55:59.740]  like the context the history of your life all of that yes yes yes but at the end of the day
[00:56:04.700]  the decision making is still like the same it's like a choice and it's crazy to think that it's
[00:56:10.140]  because i'm there that i choose to do these things but if i channel someone else like my decision
[00:56:16.300]  making is way significantly different exactly if you think about like you versus like someone else
[00:56:22.700]  it's literally all those decisions and there's this thing called like quantum leaping in the personal
[00:56:29.340]  development world and it's basically like if you are here at what you perceive as point a and you
[00:56:34.460]  want to be at point the this i don't know super successful blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you need
[00:56:41.180]  to think about what that person would be doing and thinking and acting and literally do what that
[00:56:47.020]  person is doing you will get there way faster than like if you tried really hard essentially
[00:56:54.540]  you with like your current thoughts and perceptions and beliefs would have to take a lot of time
[00:57:01.900]  and effort to get over there versus if you change your thoughts and beliefs and whatever first
[00:57:07.500]  you'd make totally different decisions that would then get you there a lot faster hence the quantum leap
[00:57:13.740]  yeah that makes total sense and it's basically what you said earlier right like kind of brainwashing
[00:57:17.900]  yourself into being like i'm this other person i'm you know this pro surfer or whatever and this is
[00:57:24.140]  how they would think this is like what i need to be doing kind of goes back to like what Jesus was
[00:57:29.180]  saying earlier it's like okay you have like you and then you have like your personality or like
[00:57:34.940]  your perception of yourself once you realize that that personality and perception of yourself
[00:57:41.260]  is completely mutable and it's actually you the real use decision how to mute change that
[00:57:47.580]  then you're like oh fuck i can be anyone yeah and like it becomes more of like fun and less burden
[00:57:54.220]  some process right compared to completely enveloping yourself into this thought of who you think you
[00:58:00.700]  are true you take off a lot of those limiters yeah like if you are really wrapped up into some idea
[00:58:08.780]  i'll give a personal example like if i think that i've been doing marketing my whole life i'm just
[00:58:15.020]  the marketer you know like this perception limits me to this ability to do this one thing versus all
[00:58:21.740]  the other things i could do writing entrepreneurship are all this kind of stuff and i even feel this way
[00:58:27.180]  with identifying myself as an artist then i'm like but what if i want to make music like what if i
[00:58:33.260]  want to write a book that's why i see these self perceptions not as like permanent things but ways
[00:58:40.780]  i can like position myself into different avenues almost yeah and i feel like there's just so much
[00:58:49.420]  power in the way that you see choices too like this is gonna sound so stupid but there's this influencer
[00:58:55.260]  named nara smith who's been blowing up on tiktok and i think she's like a moreman influencer maybe
[00:59:02.220]  but basically what she's known for is like these videos where she makes things from scratch so one of the
[00:59:07.340]  videos that really hooked me in was she was like oh my toddler said that they wanted cereal this morning
[00:59:13.580]  so i'm gonna make some cereal from scratch i don't know why but that like fucking blew my mind
[00:59:20.540]  i can't believe you can just choose to make cereal from scratch and as stupid as that sounds
[00:59:25.900]  i felt like it opened my eyes to like am i sometimes living my life as a consumer of goods rather than
[00:59:32.620]  like a living person because i feel like being able to make your own cereal is a completely
[00:59:38.860]  valid choice that anyone can just wake up and like think that way but i've just i feel like my brain
[00:59:44.220]  is wired to not think oh should i make my cereal this morning or should i eat koko povs like my
[00:59:49.180]  brain is wired to think should i eat koko povs or should i eat organic cereal or should i eat
[00:59:53.900]  like what am i consuming or like choosing to purchase almost it's like small things like that where
[00:59:58.940]  i'm just like suddenly so vividly aware of my ability to decide things for myself but i feel like
[01:00:05.580]  you know it's good to have reminders like that and i think it's one of those things where once you
[01:00:09.820]  see it out in the wild you're like able to notice it more and other things but i do want to kind of
[01:00:14.860]  ask a final question for you guys since we are coming to the end of time when do you feel the most
[01:00:22.860]  confident for me i don't think there's a specific moment in time it's literally when i make those
[01:00:29.900]  internal choices to like think differently or like you know what we were talking about negative
[01:00:34.780]  momentum before when i'm in positive momentum and i just keep building it yeah so i think those
[01:00:41.820]  moments are really clear and like sometimes it's easier in meditation because you intentionally
[01:00:47.580]  quiet your mind and usually when you quiet your mind you automatically feel better because a lot
[01:00:53.420]  of our internal dialogues are skewed towards the negative due to conditioning yeah so it's that
[01:00:59.660]  combined with quite the negative thoughts and that combined with thinking new thoughts i do want to
[01:01:04.780]  think that kind of channel this confidence so i would say those scenarios and also like when i
[01:01:10.300]  actually act upon something that was a difficult decision before and i'm like holy shit i actually
[01:01:15.660]  did it you know wow i feel like i feel the most confident when i am doing something that is very
[01:01:26.300]  true to myself like it is something that is allowing me to live my life versus like living
[01:01:33.580]  someone else's expectation of my life i guess it's when i feel like i have full autonomy
[01:01:41.020]  i'm feeling very confident because it's like yeah this is something i want to do of course i'm
[01:01:46.300]  gonna do it and i'm gonna feel great that i'm doing it regardless of how tough it might be
[01:01:52.460]  oh hmm i think mine is somewhat similar to that but in a different lens so i definitely feel the
[01:01:59.900]  most confident when day-to-day i'm making choices that build myself up choices that i think will
[01:02:06.940]  positively impact me whether that's short-term or long-term sticking to those choices and building
[01:02:13.500]  positive habits like i think those are moments where i learned to trust myself a little bit
[01:02:20.140]  trust that i'm able to make these decisions for myself and that's when i have like the strongest
[01:02:27.180]  bond with myself i love it all well thank you i for coming on today and chatting with us about
