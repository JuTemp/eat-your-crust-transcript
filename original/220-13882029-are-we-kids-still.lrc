[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal. And I'm Jeesoo. So before we get into today's topic, I have a funny story to share. So this past weekend, I went on a trip up to Napa. I found out that there is a Hooters. Oh.
[00:00:33.970] Up near that area. And it's actually the last Hooters of NorCal. Like all the other Hooters shut down in NorCal, but there's still like a decent amount in SoCal. And the thing is,
[00:00:48.290] where I used to live growing up back in Canada, there was a Hooters really close to my home. So I remember we would always like drive by it and I was like, oh my god, like what's Hooters? And we've never been, right? Right.
[00:01:03.250] So on this trip up to Napa, I was like, ooh, is it crazy if we go to Hooters? Because I've always wanted to see what it's like inside. Oh my god.
[00:01:16.290] So on our way back down, back to the bay, we stopped by Hooters and we went in and we had some wings and we watched some football. Hey, to be fair, I heard the wings at Hooters are really good. Okay, I can confirm the wings, quite good.
[00:01:33.410] We were eating them and we're like, oh dude, these wings, they're pretty good. Oh my god. Also, it was kind of cool because there were like so many TVs inside. I'm trying to remember, like, I think another popular wings joint for game watching is B-dubs
[00:01:53.010] or their full name Buffalo Wild Wings. And I remember they have like a Jumbotron at the bar area and they do have a decent amount of TVs. But maybe it's like the way that this Hooters was laid out.
[00:02:04.850] It's just like TVs all around the wall and it's a regular rectangle shape of the building. So you just feel like you're surrounded by TVs. Yeah, and there's like some hanging in the middle as well. So there's just a bunch and they're playing every single football game.
[00:02:22.210] It was a Sunday. And instead of playing music like a lot of bars or sports bars do, they're actually playing the audio from one of the games, which was pretty interesting. But yeah, it was a very interesting experience. So when we first went in there, I was like,
[00:02:43.410] oh, I'm like the only girl in this establishment, like as a customer. But then as time went on and like the more hype football games were starting, a lot of people started trickling in. And actually a decent amount of families were coming in. Oh my god.
[00:03:02.850] So that was like kind of a funny, surprising thing. The place definitely filled up and they're like quite busy. I was like, wow, it's a shame that they all shut down in NorCal. Dude, actually, now that you mention it,
[00:03:15.170] I remember me and James were having this conversation with my friend Nat and her boyfriend and me and Nat were like really wanting to go to Hooters because you hear all this hype about it. And maybe it's just more comfortable for like women to confess
[00:03:28.530] that they wanted to go to Hooters than like men to do it. But we're like, oh my god, like we should take a day and go. And then we looked it up and the only one in the bay, like you said, was like super North.
[00:03:41.010] So we were just like, damn, that's like kind of a trip. Maybe one day, but you fulfilled our dreams. Dude, I should have brought you guys. I mean, I will admit, like truly the women who work there at Hooters,
[00:03:55.010] they have to wear like these super tight tank tops and like really short booty shorts. And I was like, oh my god, I can't look at them like below their neck. I just I feel like so rude if I were to. Making extreme eye contact. Oh my god.
[00:04:12.850] Well, didn't you once say the term like elevator eyes or something? You're trying to keep the elevator on the penthouse. Oh yeah, exactly. Oh man. Actually, that's kind of hilarious because I was just in Texas with my family and James.
[00:04:32.210] We are going to like some sort of steakhouse. We were going to eat lunch somewhere and we were driving by like this barbecue place that me and James had gone to without my parents. So we were like, oh, like that's the barbecue place that we were at.
[00:04:45.410] It was really good. And my mom looks over and basically it was just like the barbecue place. And then right next to it was Hooters. But the Hooters like logo and everything is like really bright orange.
[00:04:54.930] Yeah, I guess she just immediately was like, oh, like did you guys go to Hooters? And my dad was like, no, no. Your dad is like, please tell me they weren't at Hooters. Yeah, exactly. Like just lie to my face. But yeah, it was a pretty interesting experience.
[00:05:12.290] And my takeaway is that Hooters does indeed have solid wings. All right. It's crystal verified. Hooters wings are bomb. But speaking of Dallas, I'm going to go ahead and say that I'm not a big fan of Dallas. Do you?
[00:05:29.170] But speaking of Dallas, I also have a somewhat funny story. And low key, this might be one of those funny stories that are like only funny to me because it was kind of a weird situation. But, you know, I'll try my best to tell it.
[00:05:44.930] Today, this morning, James and I flew back from Dallas to SJC and we took a pretty early morning flight. So the flight left at 9 a.m. CST, which means we had to like get up at 7 and leave the house by 7 to get to the airport, etc., etc.
[00:06:01.970] So as you can imagine, we were somewhat tired when we got on the flight. And usually after takeoff, when we're at the appropriate height or whatever the plane like, you know how they come around and start serving drinks? Right, right.
[00:06:14.290] But this was a really small plane, so they didn't push the like drink cart down. It was more of like they would go and ask everyone what they wanted and then they would come back with a tray of drinks and serve it out to people.
[00:06:25.330] But I think basically James and I were like knocked out during the ordering part. So when we woke up and we were looking around, everyone was getting like handed drinks. So I was in the window seat and then James was in the middle seat.
[00:06:38.530] So I was like, oh, James, like can you flag someone down and see if we can order a drink? So he was like, OK, sure. And then this flight attendant was walking by and he flags her down.
[00:06:47.490] And he's like, oh, can we get like a coffee and a ginger ale, please? And then she like gave him a really dirty look. I don't know why. I think it could be because he had like AirPod, like the noise cancelling AirPods on.
[00:06:59.730] So maybe he was talking like more loud than usual or something. But she just like shot him like the dirtiest side eye ever and then walked away. James looks back at me and we start like laughing because we were like, what the hell just happened? Yeah.
[00:07:12.130] And then literally like five seconds later, a different flight attendant comes by and then she's like, hey, like, you know, you guys didn't order any drinks when you guys were sleeping. So like, do you want a drink?
[00:07:25.730] And I don't know why, but we like repeated our order again. So he was like, oh, yeah, like can I get a coffee? And I was like, oh, and I'll have a ginger ale. Like, thanks so much. And then she walks away.
[00:07:35.330] So she comes back with the drinks and hands us a coffee and a ginger ale. And then the first lady who like gave us like a dirty side eye came back and handed us the same drinks and gave us another weird look.
[00:07:48.370] Because she's like, why the fuck do you guys have two of the same drinks? And I did not want a coffee and James did not want a ginger ale. So now I'm just like, oh my God, like we're so stupid. I don't know why we ordered twice.
[00:07:59.890] But I got into like a huge laughing fit where I was shaking violently from laughing and like literally crying tears from laughing so hard. But yeah, I was just like, am I delirious or was that weird? Wait, that was definitely weird.
[00:08:16.450] I feel like if anything, it almost feels like the first person might have sent the second person. Maybe she's shot the dirty look because she was like, oh, that's not my job. Someone's about to come around and ask you. But then she came back with the drinks anyway.
[00:08:31.970] Yeah, and I felt like it was kind of like a message where she didn't want to do it. And like you said, I did somewhat think that she sent the next lady or she knew like,
[00:08:41.810] oh, this other lady is going to come around and ask everyone for drinks anyway. So I'll just wait and have her do it. And also, I didn't know that James had asked for our drinks or I didn't know he was like, oh, can I get these two drinks?
[00:08:53.650] I thought he was just like, oh, can we like order some drinks? And then she did the dirty look and walked away. So yeah, I just have to like chug a coffee and a ginger ale. I'm also imagining like the awkward moment when, you know,
[00:09:07.970] the first person comes by, drops off the drinks for you. And the other person is just behind her, like looking at her hands, like what the fuck is happening? Yeah, exactly. Oh my god, it was really cringe actually. Okay, don't think too hard about it.
[00:09:27.250] You're off that plane now. You'll never see them again. I'm like adding this to the list of things that keep me up at night. All right. Well, thank you for sharing your hectic story of the weekend.
[00:09:42.050] Now let's move on to the topic at hand, which I guess isn't too related to our stories. But I kind of wanted us to talk about our general feelings about like, are we a kid still? Are we an adult?
[00:09:56.770] Are we just like faking it till we make it in society right now? I feel like I personally sometimes maybe more often than not feel like a kid still. So I wanted to ask if there's ever like moments or things that make you still feel like a kid.
[00:10:16.530] Ooh, actually, I would say this is somewhat topical because I was just with my parents for about 10 days. And I think always just being back at home with my parents makes me feel the most like a kid.
[00:10:29.810] For one, I don't have to do like housework and chores and clean. Although I'm a horrible daughter for not helping out as much as I should. But also, I think it's just the default position that you take when you're with your parents,
[00:10:42.930] because there's such a clear and distinct hierarchy there. Whereas in like the professional world, your older manager isn't necessarily like your father, you know? Right, right. So then I think that's probably when I feel the most childlike. But I think it manifests in like funky way sometimes.
[00:11:01.010] I was kind of thinking about it actually, where I feel like I get a little bratty when I go and visit my parents because I almost feel, I don't want to say entitled, but I almost feel like, oh, this is the only time I can be a kid.
[00:11:16.050] So I'm gonna use it to my full advantage and be as childlike as I can sort of. And I'm obviously not actively thinking this, but looking back at my behavior, I feel like this was like the stance that I took somehow. Yeah.
[00:11:29.170] So it does manifest in like a weird way sometimes. You're kind of just like subconsciously reverting back to the like, oh my god, nice, I'm the center of my parents' universe. Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:43.890] And they enable it too, because we only get a couple of days together like in a year or so. Right. I feel like that totally makes sense. Yeah, I guess I sometimes wonder, because that's definitely logically like the most
[00:11:56.450] sensible or like common maybe time to feel like a kid when you're with your parents. And since I am still living at home with my parents, I wonder like, oh, maybe because I'm with them, even if I don't consciously think it,
[00:12:13.650] it just like leaks into my life subconsciously. But I feel like even in the workplace, I feel it sometimes where I just feel young. And then because I feel young, I feel like a kid or like maybe I still feel really green at work, green as in new.
[00:12:31.810] But when I think about it and when I sit down and think, I'm like, oh, well, actually, I've been working at this company for almost four years or I've been in the workforce for like five or six years now. I'm actually not that new.
[00:12:47.890] But for some reason, it's just kind of like I just feel that way. I think partially maybe because I have actually always been the youngest person at work. It's crazy because we're 27 now and I've still never experienced being older than someone at work.
[00:13:04.610] Yeah, that is really interesting, actually. And maybe that's why I don't feel that necessarily at work so much, because I feel that every year we do have waves of like younger and younger people come in to work for a company.
[00:13:19.090] And it's nice because they're so like non-jaded, not to say that everyone else is jaded, but they're very like fresh and bring like a specific vibe and energy to the workplace. But also it ages me a little bit where when I first joined the company, I was 22.
[00:13:35.410] And then I'm just sitting here thinking, damn, I can't believe it's actually been a full five years here. Like the people at work have seen me move into an apartment in SF, get engaged by house.
[00:13:47.170] It's like crazy that they've seen me through these life stages so that it makes me feel old too, where I'm like, OK, these people that are new are in my position and now I have to take on a different role of older person that's been here kind of.
[00:14:01.170] Yeah, it's kind of crazy because I always thought that I would eventually get to the point where I would see or meet people who are younger than me at work like every day, you know? Right. But it just hasn't been the case.
[00:14:16.770] And I guess because of that, I always feel like I'm playing catch up to other people like, oh, I'm getting closer to everyone else's average age versus like, oh, nice. There's younger people coming in. Wait till you hear that everyone else is also aging.
[00:14:34.450] I know, dude, I can never catch up. But I do think when we do hire new people, there is like kind of an average age there. So that is like the pinpoint where I'm like, oh, I'm like getting closer to that.
[00:14:49.890] Do you think that feeling pretty young at work impacts the way you see work or maybe impacts the way you see yourself at work a little bit? I think maybe a little bit for sure.
[00:15:02.770] It sometimes makes me feel like, oh, who am I to speak up, I guess, especially if it's like a bigger meeting or like a more important meeting. Not that I personally have to be in those too often, but I think it just adds to the
[00:15:18.050] seniority of other people in my mind, whether it's subconscious or consciously. It's kind of like whatever they say goes, I can put in a small word. But who am I to have a huge impact anyway?
[00:15:31.490] That's a really good point because it kind of cements to in my mind of leadership or people who can have very strong opinions about stuff are older. So that sometimes when people at my company who are, you know, my age or maybe even younger
[00:15:46.610] than me, like when they speak up and they have a strong opinion and they're like really pushing for that opinion, I'm kind of like, whoa, that's crazy that you did that, even though you're whatever age.
[00:15:59.410] Which is kind of like the wrong way to think about it because being older doesn't mean you have a better opinion all the time. But I guess I just always correlate like age with experience.
[00:16:09.570] So I know what you mean about like feeling shy or maybe thinking like, maybe I'll shoot someone an email after this meeting. Yeah, for sure. I think it also sometimes leads to like maybe personal confusion.
[00:16:23.730] So I guess an example is that actually the team that I'm on right now, I've been part of it since its inception, which is not even that long ago. It's like two years ago, I guess.
[00:16:36.770] But like this team was sort of newly formed, reorg and like bits and pieces formed together to become what it is now. So low key, like in a way, I have a certain degree of like more experience than other
[00:16:52.690] people on the specific team because I've been there since its inception. But of course, like other people might be higher level, like literal corporate level. Yeah, I guess sometimes there's that aspect that you kind of forget about and then it's
[00:17:06.450] like, oh wait, if you think about it, I do have things I can bring to the table or like knowledge that people might not have known beforehand about this team. So there's like this in addition to the like feeling like a kid, you're like, oh, well,
[00:17:21.570] actually, I guess I'm not a kid or I know certain things. And then your mind is like, what am I? Yeah, it's definitely always a trip to explain things to people that are clearly older than
[00:17:35.170] you or maybe in like a higher level or like older life stage than you. Yeah. Where I'm like, I can't believe I have something to teach you because you're older. I don't know. It like doesn't make any sense. But at the same time, I think it does.
[00:17:47.490] You know, I do feel like in the professional world, technically everyone is supposed to be like ageless, right? Like you're all in professional society together. Really what matters is probably like you said, like the corporate level or what managerial tier you're in. I don't know.
[00:18:05.650] I wonder if there's like a specific age where that flips and you no longer are so conscious about it. Dude, I don't know. But something that was kind of interesting was I was grabbing lunch with a couple of
[00:18:17.250] coworkers the other day and one of them wasn't directly on my team, just someone who sits nearby and like we sometimes work together with. And he straight up asked us our ages. Whoa. And I was like, whoa, because I never reveal my age at work. Yeah.
[00:18:36.530] Because I try not to come off as younger. I'm always consciously fighting this kid mindset, you know? Right. But it's okay. It was like a very casual lunch and it was just like three of us.
[00:18:48.610] So I was like shifty eyed for a bit and I was like, um, I'm 27. And then my coworker was like, I'm 38. And I was like, whoa, because I actually didn't know his age either. I don't ever explicitly ask our teammates either because I'm not trying to age them.
[00:19:07.970] Right. I'm not trying to de-age them. You know, I'm just trying to like take everyone at face value pretty much, which is how I hope they take me. But when he like revealed his age, I was like, oh shit.
[00:19:21.090] Like this guy's a little older than I thought he was. I thought he was more like maybe mid to early-ish 30s. But yeah, I was like, oh no, I hope this doesn't change the way like our work relationship is because we have like a pretty good work relationship.
[00:19:38.530] But I guess like just knowing that information, it's like in the back of your mind, you're like, oh shit, this guy's like a little older than I thought. And he's probably like, oh, Crystal's like a little younger than I thought.
[00:19:50.850] It like kind of sucks, but I do agree that it somewhat changes it. I think it's actually better, like you said, to just not know at all. Then you can only speculate and you can give a pretty broad range of like, okay, this guy's
[00:20:02.690] like between 30 to 40 or something. Like between like 35 to 45 or something. Or it's like, oh, this guy is just, he's older than me. Or like, you know, this person is just older than me. Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:15.810] But once you know, it's like you see their face and their age is like hovering over there. Luckily, I don't feel like it's affecting anything so far. But you know, our ages were revealed on Thursday and right now it's Sunday. So it's only been a few days.
[00:20:33.010] Actually, I found the ageless work society thing kind of interesting in the US. And I've grown up in the US like my whole life basically since I was four. But I do consume a lot of like Korean cultural stuff.
[00:20:47.890] And I think in Korea, age is a really strong arbiter of like hierarchy. So you know, people with even just maybe as small as like a three month or six month age difference use different honorifics languages with each other.
[00:21:05.410] And there's some sort of hierarchy of like, okay, seniority deems who says what to who, but then so does the age hierarchy. So there's all these rules that are both confusing, but in some ways, like comforting at the same time, because it's some sort of structure.
[00:21:19.570] So you know exactly what you're supposed to say to like what person, but in the US, like everyone is addressed by first name and doesn't matter what the age is. And you're all just coworkers and you all hang out and stuff like that.
[00:21:32.530] You know, I just thought it was kind of hard to adjust to and adjust isn't even the right word because I've never worked in like anything, you know, in like a Korean company or in Korea at all.
[00:21:43.570] But it just felt wrong to just like address significantly older coworkers by their first name and just like talk to them about daily life. You know, when we're talking about someone's kids or like someone's families, it's like normal or like it doesn't feel as weird.
[00:21:59.650] But I feel like when you start talking about like, oh, what do you do on Friday nights and things like that? I'm just like, oh my god, this is like, very interesting. Yeah. You're like, am I learning too much about you or is this just the right amount?
[00:22:13.730] Exactly. I feel like it's still something that I'm kind of grappling with. And my hope is like the day that I finally see someone younger than me at work, I will start to feel more like an adult. You'll be free from your curse. Yeah.
[00:22:32.130] But speaking of, do you have moments on the flip side that make you feel very adult-like? So I would say that cooking and like doing house chores makes me feel very adult. I mean, there's some house chores that I've done since college or even since like high
[00:22:52.050] school and things like that. So like, I guess cooking is somewhat part of it. But like laundry, for example, doesn't make me feel old. But really like sitting down and preparing like a full meal for myself and James or even
[00:23:04.130] having like dinner parties or something makes me feel kind of old. Like I can't help but see myself as my mom in a sense. You know, I just think about all those times my mom has prepared food and it's kind of
[00:23:19.170] like a bittersweet feeling, I would say, where I'm like, oh, that's so cool. This is like what mom used to do. But at the same time, I'm like, damn, if I'm my mom's age and doing what mom used to do, that mom is like older now. Right.
[00:23:32.210] Which is also kind of tougher to grapple with. That is a good one, though. I think I can agree. Like there's a difference between cooking for yourself and cooking for more than what like yourself.
[00:23:44.770] And then when you're cooking for other people too, there's definitely a sense of like responsibility and like adult-ness. No, it's so true. I think especially like hosting people and you're like, oh, I have this shopping list
[00:23:59.090] of party stuff and, you know, I want to be a good hostess. And like really that hostess thing is what makes me feel like I'm a 40-year-old suburban housewife or something. You're like, damn, I can do it all. Exactly. Wow. Wow.
[00:24:18.930] I guess like if I think about what makes me feel adult, low-key seeing people in college like undergrad makes me feel kind of old. And I think it's like the reflection and the thought where it's like, oh, shoot, like we used to be at that age.
[00:24:37.890] And I thought that like the current age we're at 26, 27, I mean nearly 28 is like they have their life put together. And then we're here and I'm like, hmm, not so sure about that one. But I guess we are adults in a sense. Dude, that's such a good one.
[00:24:57.010] I went to a concert near UC Berkeley a couple months ago and I think that was move-in week or something like that, like maybe freshman orientation week. So everyone on the streets were clearly freshmen.
[00:25:09.890] At least I really felt like they were because they were like taking photos and like dressed to the nines on a random Thursday night. And I was like, wow, this is, you know, they're feeling stuff that we felt 10 years ago, which is just like horrible to think about.
[00:25:23.970] Oh, God. We're so fucking old. The crazy part is like we're not even that old in the grand scheme of things. But like I can totally understand when people are like, oh my God, like you're so young.
[00:25:38.530] I was once your age because we're feeling that to like, you know, the slightly younger generation. Right. We're just going to keep feeling it in waves. Oh my God. Yeah, that's a really good one though.
[00:25:51.490] There's nothing like seeing someone significantly younger than you to remind you of your old age. Dude, also for some reason on TikTok I keep getting like, oh, weekly study vlog or like study plans for a great fall quarter.
[00:26:07.970] I'm like, I'm like a 27 year old, like five years into work. Please stop recommending this. OK, but does it feel worse to get millennial TikTok? Oh God. Or like Gen Z, like young TikTok, you know? That's a good one, honestly.
[00:26:30.290] I want to say I'm really not on millennial TikTok much, which is good. It's just specifically the study stuff where I'm like, fuck, should I study something to feel young again? You're like, take this part out of the algorithm. Yeah, yeah. Not interested.
[00:26:49.010] Dude, actually I get a lot of millennial TikTok stuff. Oh my God, Crystal, you're old. It's like the people who are creating the content are also clearly millennials. And then also sometimes it's like work related or, you know, that kind of stuff or like things
[00:27:06.210] that millennials are into, like Harry Potter or like, you know, very specific, like that kind of stuff. Yeah. And at first I didn't think much about it, but then after a while I was like, oh shit, I'm low key on millennial TikTok.
[00:27:22.930] It's like I'm shocked, but it's also a little bit fitting. I think if we traded TikTok algorithms or like for you pages, we would both have a culture shock. Because mine is like really dumb.
[00:27:41.250] I get like bits and pieces of Gen Z, but for the most part it's just like millennial stuff. So I guess outside of our families and outside of the workplace, when you're just out and
[00:27:53.650] about, maybe like grocery shopping or just on the streets at cafes or restaurants on the weekends, you know, just living your life outside of these two spheres. Are there any things that make you feel old or young? Oh my God. Actually, yes.
[00:28:09.730] Sometimes when I'm out and about, in my mind, a like constant thought I have is, wow, I hope I don't look like some high school kid or like college kid running around. Yeah.
[00:28:22.450] I guess especially if we're near like a school or something like that, I'm like, whoa, I hope I don't blend in too much with these college kids who are like literally almost 10 years younger than us. Damn, that's so interesting.
[00:28:36.210] I feel like I never have had thoughts like that. Dude, I don't know. I like have that thought and I'm like, oh wow, like I guess I probably totally pass as them because like realistically, you know, early 20s and late 20s, we look pretty similar
[00:28:51.090] in terms of like age wise. It's hard to like tell that difference. I mean, honestly, like a lot of 30 year olds look the same as well. So that's definitely a thought I have. It happens less when I'm grocery shopping because I'm usually focused on like, oh, I
[00:29:04.850] need to get these things. But I think the thought does kind of cross my mind sometimes. Maybe in my shopping list, I have like something that has alcohol in it and like, oh, I'm going to get carded because I look so young. Fuck.
[00:29:19.330] You know, that kind of stuff. That's interesting. Yeah, I think I know what you mean because I guess when you put everyone from 20 to like early 30s on a suspect line or whatever and try to identify everyone into the right age bucket, it's probably hard to do that.
[00:29:34.850] I will say my thoughts on age are maybe not as positive as yours where I'm like, damn, I wonder if I look hella old or, you know, I just have like fear of aging, right? Which I think is somewhat natural around this age range.
[00:29:48.050] But I will say like I have had experiences where, you know, I'm so used to like working now and I feel like I'm 35 or something like at work. That's how old I feel.
[00:29:58.930] And then I'll go and get like a facial somewhere and, you know, the facial ladies are supposed to be nice to you, but they'll be like, oh, you're pretty young, huh? Like how recently did you graduate college or something? And I'm like, what the fuck?
[00:30:09.810] Like, how do you know? Because I feel like I'm almost 40 in a couple of years. So that's always sort of interesting where I think depending on what environment you feel the most yourself in or maybe like feel like you're in the most, maybe that's what
[00:30:26.930] kind of guides your age. And then when people say stuff that's not similar to that internal age that you think of yourself as, I feel like that's where the jarring like thoughts kind of happen. Maybe.
[00:30:41.730] Okay, so sometimes also I live kind of close to a school and when I come back from work, if I like come back really early in the day, sometimes I catch the like wave of people picking up their kids.
[00:30:55.970] They're like all over the streets, like ants and stuff. And I'll like park in front of my house and I'll get out of my car and I have this like just random thought cross my mind.
[00:31:09.650] I wonder if I look like a college kid to these people or like a fully functioning adult. And then I like quietly walk into my home. Yeah, that's the Asian genes always doing us good in the aging area. Yeah.
[00:31:26.850] But interestingly, you said like internally you feel like you're 35. Yeah, I guess it kind of swings pretty hard. Like, I think my thoughts and feelings are sensitive to my environment. You know, times where I'm working a lot, I really do feel like I'm the average age of
[00:31:45.890] my coworkers who I feel like maybe somewhere around 35-ish. And you know, I think it's just like, I don't know if it's like fucking hormones or something, but like my wanting to have kids really badly too. I'm just like ready, you know? Yeah.
[00:31:59.010] I'm like, okay, actually like I probably should wait a couple years, enjoy the marriage life and whatnot and not do it. But you know, I just feel like a 35-year-old mom waiting for my physical body to like catch up sort of. Oh my God. Yeah.
[00:32:13.970] And you know, of course when I go back to Dallas and like visit my parents or even when I visit James's mom sometimes I do still get that like, oh, I'm a kid vibe.
[00:32:24.210] But what really makes me feel old is when we have hangouts planned and like social things and you know, towards like the back 10% or 15% of the hangout, I'm like, oh, I have this like other thing I need to do. That really makes me feel old.
[00:32:42.290] You're like, I got shit to do, errands to run. Yeah. And maybe a part of being a child or like having that childlike innocence is you're just like blissful all the time, no worries and things like that.
[00:32:55.490] But I have shit I'm worrying about in my life, you know? I have like things to clean and like chores to do. And you know, sometimes it's like I have to sleep early for work and that really makes me feel old.
[00:33:08.370] I'm like, I can't have a life because I have a nine to five. Wow, that's so interesting. Because I think I've definitely experienced similar things, right? Like, oh, I got to sleep earlier tonight because I got to get to work early tomorrow or like,
[00:33:23.650] oh, I got some chores to do back home. But for some reason that doesn't tie to age for me. At least it doesn't make me feel older necessarily. It just feels like, oh, that's just like life right now. But yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:38.050] I actually sometimes forget my age and maybe mentally I almost think I'm closer to 24, 25. And maybe that's why I feel more like a kid. I don't know. It's just like, I don't know what it is. Maybe that's like around the age COVID happened.
[00:33:55.810] So maybe that was like trauma without realizing. Dude, that's such a good point, actually. We just like lost years off our life. Right? So I think part of it is that like maybe we definitely kind of just like lost a couple
[00:34:09.970] of years of our lives just sitting at home doing not much. So then maybe mentally I'm just like, yeah, I'm still like 25. I think it's kind of comforting in a way that you and I both have different,
[00:34:22.690] I guess like internal age clocks or whatnot, because that just makes me realize that it's so relative. Like it's so based on your living environment or maybe like your priorities at the moment or your like weekly lifestyle and schedule, your internal attitude, like all these things
[00:34:41.010] kind of form that. And we're the same age, but we just have like different thoughts about it. So then it makes me feel like, okay, it's just like a fake age. I'm not actually 35. I am 27.
[00:34:55.090] And if I wanted to, I could think that I'm 24, 25, but it's just how I'm choosing to live my life right now. You're like, it's time to wind back that clock. Dude, I don't know.
[00:35:08.290] I think I feel the age a little bit in the loss of like spontaneity in my life. There's plenty of things that I still do spontaneously unplanned that I find very fun.
[00:35:20.930] But for example, like in high school, even on a school night, if I wanted to see the stars or something like me and my friend Nat would go and we would go like stargaze. And it was like this huge adventure to like explore the world.
[00:35:34.770] And everything was just so like new and cool because we had just gotten like our cars basically. So like I can never forget that feeling or like even the scent of the outdoor air, like at 9pm on like a Wednesday or something with Nat.
[00:35:49.330] And to this day, I think I still kind of romanticize stargazing in a way. But every time I sit down and I try to like plan it into the calendar, I'm like,
[00:35:58.530] this isn't a good day because tomorrow I have an 8am meeting and this isn't a good day because I have to go like shower early and like meet up with whoever on like Saturday morning. And I'm just like, what the fuck?
[00:36:08.610] I'm like mourning this part of my life. That's so funny. You're like, oh, this is actually not a good day because we got some smoke up in California. Yeah, exactly. It's too much logic now. Dang, that's true.
[00:36:25.570] There's definitely like a loss of spontaneity and I think it's inevitable. Like no matter how spontaneous you are as a person, there's definitely some structure you have to enact in your life, at least a little bit to like keep things up and running. Right.
[00:36:41.810] I think also, I was kind of thinking about this as you were talking. Maybe I also feel like I have like things I want to do before I feel ready to like, I don't know, take on more responsibility.
[00:36:59.330] Like how you are like, yo, I'm low-key ready to have a kid. But I'm like, dude, there's no way right now because I have like these things I want to do. So I wonder if maybe that's also something that plays into it where it's like, I feel
[00:37:12.530] like I still have some goals that I'm trying to reach. So that makes me feel younger. But I feel like for you, you've reached a lot of different big milestones, like engagement, buying a home, really from an objective point of view.
[00:37:28.610] Like it feels like you have a lot of things put together and like you're like settled in a certain sense. So I wonder if like because of that, it's another factor. You're like, yeah, dude, I'm ready.
[00:37:41.410] I'm feeling steady and like, you know, able to take on these next level life tasks. That's so nice. But I think it does make sense because I think it's also maybe just human nature in a sense, at least for myself.
[00:38:01.170] It's like there were certain things that I wanted to do before childbirth. And then now that those things are like somewhat being cleared out, I'm like, okay, childbirth. But I also kind of wonder, I've spent the last eight years of my life with James kind
[00:38:15.410] of like dreaming up of a future together. And I feel like there are certain goals that are easier to have when you are an individual person thinking about your personal goals versus like for a couple thinking of goals for you and your significant other.
[00:38:31.410] So then maybe that also kind of plays into it where like the balanced goals that you can have together as a couple are maybe more specific in nature. That's true. I feel like definitely.
[00:38:44.610] And, you know, honestly, that's a really good point you bring up about like being in a relationship because just the way that society dictates it right now, it's like such a norm to be
[00:38:57.090] in a relationship and like, you know, eventually get married and do all that stuff, have kids, like whatever. Right. And I do feel like a lot of most people genuinely want to follow that path.
[00:39:09.970] But I mean, there's definitely people out there who are like, fuck it, like I'm totally fine being single. And then I guess like in that sense, like you said, some goals are like more, I guess
[00:39:22.770] like possible or like maybe even reachable when you're a couple because that's kind of just how society has been designed. And not to mention just like the crazy inflation and like capitalism that's dictating our world. But yeah, I think that is definitely a good point.
[00:39:41.890] And also, I feel like, you know, just being with someone for so long, it also helps with that like foundational feeling. You're like, oh, we have like each other to rely on. And like you've built eight years of trust and like you're ready to build more.
[00:39:58.370] So it's like, it's probably a very grounding thing to have is my guess. Maybe that's the trade off there, right? It's like I feel like there are definitely benefits to a certain sense of being single,
[00:40:13.970] especially in kind of like formative years of your adulthood where you can grow really fast and do a lot of trial and error and bump into walls and see your depths and lows and your peaks and highs or whatever.
[00:40:29.810] I think you don't get as much of that up and down when you're in a relationship. So then you get more of like that stability aspect. But I think in terms of maybe like self-growth and self-exploration and just kind of like
[00:40:44.770] the adventurous aspect of life, I feel like you maybe don't get as much. So maybe that's why they say if you live, I mean, I guess I don't know who is saying this, but I feel like I've heard this before about single people in New York.
[00:40:59.570] They're like partying into their 40s as if they're still in their 20s. And I admire that in a sense, right? It's like, yeah, they are living like they're in their 20s and there's nothing wrong with that really.
[00:41:12.530] It's just what they want to do and what they prioritize and looks fun as fuck too. Yeah, true. Like to each their own, do whatever feels right for you in the moment. Mm-hmm.
[00:41:23.330] Yeah, and I guess that also maybe shows like how environment could be a bit of a factor. Like New York's very fast paced. There's a lot to do. So it's very easy to get like caught up in whatever.
[00:41:35.730] So the focus isn't always form a family and like settle down right away. But then in the suburbs, it's like life is a little slower and you have more time to like really plan these things out and like take a good look at this.
[00:41:47.890] So at least that's how I kind of view like suburbs versus city life pacing and stuff. Yeah, that's a really good point, actually. And I'm like personally very sensitive to where I live or like my environment.
[00:42:01.650] So I feel like low-key if I grew up in like a farm in the countryside or something, I would be like, oh my God, I can't wait to like churn butter on the weekends or just like really lead into that farm life. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:14.470] I think another kind of interesting thing about like age and stuff outside of environment is there's this like kind of saying or theory, I guess, that celebrities, they stay at the mental age that they became famous or like the year they became famous because it's
[00:42:35.750] like a huge transitional year. And also like fame is low-key trauma because suddenly there's all these eyes on you. They're like nitpicking at your life and like watching everything you do, paparazzi chasing you around, all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:53.190] It's interesting because I feel like that kind of theory is used as a past sometimes like, oh yeah, that's why like all these older male celebrities date so young because they're like mentally still at that age or something. Right.
[00:43:09.190] Or even they're just like, this was a stupid act, but like they've had so much scrutiny on them. At a certain point, it's not always their fault directly. So yeah, I mean, what do you think about that?
[00:43:24.070] Or do you feel like you even have a trauma that has caused you to be stuck at a mental age? This is so random, but I just listened to this podcast where Jojo Siwa, the blonde girl who's a dancer from Dance Mom.
[00:43:42.330] She's known for her big bows and stuff. Like she was just on a podcast and I was listening to the episode and she got famous. I think it was around maybe like 14 or slightly younger. Oh wow. And now she's 20 years old.
[00:43:54.890] She was saying something like, you know, when I was younger, I felt like I was already an old person, like an adult because she's doing all these things. She's literally working and on TV shows and on sets and stuff.
[00:44:08.730] And she knew that what she was getting into with Dance Moms was for the purpose of money and fame. And because she was aware, she felt like a working adult basically. And I feel like to a certain extent, I can relate to that.
[00:44:26.090] I was obviously not on anything remotely close to Dance Moms. But my parents moved away from the US temporarily when I was like 21, 22. And now they're back in the US but not in the same state as me.
[00:44:46.890] And I feel like for an only child who was kind of very close to her parents, it was a little bit traumatic for me. So in a sense, I feel like I'm not stuck in the mental age of 22.
[00:44:59.930] Maybe I am when I'm back, like hanging out with my parents. I'm like, oh, I want to be an adult again. But I do kind of feel like sort of like that entitlement I was talking about in the beginning
[00:45:09.770] of like, oh, I feel like when I was actually 22, I wasn't able to be this age. So now, you know, say at 22, I felt like 27. And in the last eight years, now I feel like I'm 35. Yeah, I feel some sort of like loss about feeling 22.
[00:45:29.450] Like I feel like in some ways, I wasn't able to feel 22 to 27 fully. For me, it's probably not really like trauma. But I feel like I had to grow up a little bit quicker in those few years than I would
[00:45:42.890] have had to if my parents had still lived in California near me. So then I feel like sort of weirdness about that time frame. That makes total sense. Yeah, I guess like the theory is only one sided because both of your examples totally
[00:45:58.650] show how it can also, you know, like some sort of trauma or like, I don't know, fame or whatever can cause someone to have to actually grow up faster for a while. And then, well, we don't know what happens after that.
[00:46:10.650] But like, and I liked your example too, because I feel like when that happened to you, literally pretty much everyone around us, like the people that we were hanging out with a lot,
[00:46:23.690] we all still had our parents really close by, because a lot of us are from the Bay Area. And so a lot of our families are here. And you know, as things go, a lot of Bay Area people end up back in the Bay Area. Right.
[00:46:38.650] So it was definitely very obvious that you were the first person to, in a sense, like leave the nest, because you're forced out. Like, okay, like not am I'm not leaving the nest. The nest was like taken out from under me. Right? Yeah, that's true.
[00:46:56.650] It's also the loss of choice there that was like, oh. You're like, oh shit, I need to either make a new nest or like, I just fall down like shit. Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:08.250] I mean, like you were the first person to move, quote unquote, move out from home and like, live in your own apartment with James, which I'm sure was helpful because we were like still pretty young at the time.
[00:47:22.970] Just like from there, because you had the first starting point, you've just been like a few steps ahead of the average from our friend groups that we hang out with. Yeah, I think it was definitely very circumstantial.
[00:47:35.450] I actually do sometimes think about what would have happened if my parents did stay here, like how my life would have flown. And I think in some ways it's definitely a positive. Like I can be someone who leans on my parents a little bit too much.
[00:47:50.490] So, you know, at least having them like removed from the neighborhood or like, you know, not in California, like maybe that made me grow up a little bit because I can be fully immature if I'm like allowed to be.
[00:48:05.610] Yeah, but I think I do wish I could have spent those years, especially like COVID and whatnot, like near my family. So that kind of sucks. But you know, hardship and trauma and like all of that is so relative.
[00:48:17.610] Like I feel like to a lot of people, this is very normal of a situation. But just like you said, like a lot of people around us weren't going through the same thing as me at the time.
[00:48:25.930] So then I think I especially felt the effects like a little bit harder. Yeah, for sure. It was also kind of a surprise, wasn't it? Like, oh shit, like this is happening. Yeah, I was like, oh, bye. At the time, it was a very cool opportunity.
[00:48:42.170] So it was exciting. But you know, as an only child, I was like, why are they abandoning me? Yeah, I can totally get how it would feel like abandonment. I mean, I actually literally read a Reddit thread once where this it was a mom posting
[00:48:56.010] and she was like, oh my god, like I am trying to move out of state because I have this really cool job opportunity, but I don't want to like I feel kind of guilty leaving my only daughter. I think she was also like college or so.
[00:49:10.250] And she was like, I felt really bad. And like she complains that I'm abandoning her, blah, blah, blah. And it's like, OK, this is kind of the natural course of things that like eventually child
[00:49:22.410] and parent will most likely go their separate ways, you know, follow their own career, like do whatever. But because it's like so sudden and like unprepared for it, you're like, oh, fuck, like I'm being abandoned. True.
[00:49:37.210] In some ways, it makes you think about like seeing your parents in a slightly more morbid way. Like even now my parents live pretty close. It's like a four hour flight or something. But it's not like I can be in Dallas like half the year every year.
[00:49:55.690] So then every time I see them, I'm always like counting. I'm like, when's the next time I can see them? How many days do we spend together? And eventually I feel like it gets to the point where like every year I'm counting like
[00:50:07.210] how many days did I see my parents this year? And it's not very big. And it's like, you know, I just assume the older we get, it's going to be harder and harder maybe like now I might have more flexibility.
[00:50:17.770] But who knows when we have kids or, you know, whatever happens in life. So in that aspect, too, I feel like I had to like mentally prepare myself a little bit more or maybe it's just like slightly more logistical planning about seeing my parents.
[00:50:34.250] Well, maybe when they retire, you guys can figure something out. That's true. Well, I think at the end of the day, kind of like you said earlier, a lot of this like feeling of age is mental in a sense.
[00:50:49.130] Of course, we can physically feel it eventually, but there's definitely like a mindset and mentality. And I don't think there's a right or wrong to any of this. I think also we're in a pretty transitional time period in our lives.
[00:51:03.210] You know, late 20s, we're getting really close to 30. So I'm sure there's a lot of jumblings in our brains. And I'm sure a lot of people who are older than us probably felt something similar.
[00:51:15.610] So I guess all we can hope for is that we survive and we find our footing along the way. Thank you, Jisoo, for chatting with me through this very low-key existential crisis topic. It's so true. It was a great conversation for a Sunday afternoon.
