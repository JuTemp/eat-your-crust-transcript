[00:00:00.160] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Jeffrey. So today we have on a brand new guest. He is our friend Jeffrey and he will be joining us today to talk about dealing with stagnation in our daily lives and discussing what has
[00:00:27.180] really inspired change for us recently. But before we dive into that topic, Crystal, what's our Gen Z word this week? So remember how we mentioned that Gen Z doesn't really love acronyms? Right. So I brought a funny acronym because it's so
[00:00:46.740] outrageous that I'm not even sure if it's truly Gen Z slang, but I think it is. IJBOL. Which is basically I J B O L. And it stands for I just burst out laughing. And my theory on this
[00:01:04.620] word actually is that it might be like almost a fake slang word. I think a lot of Gen Z actually don't use it, but it's been floating around. I don't know, maybe it just like hasn't gone as viral. But it was funny because this one streamer that I
[00:01:21.380] sometimes see on TikTok, he had like a clip where someone in his chat taught him like, Oh, do you know what IJBOL is? Like, this is what IJBOL is like, don't be a boomer. He's like, okay. And
[00:01:32.060] then a few days later, he he's in a game and he meets some random like Gen Z-er and he's like, Oh, do you know IJBOL? And she's like, No, what the fuck is that? He's like, your age is showing and she was like, that's kind of mean.
[00:01:46.060] Dude, I upon hearing that I'm like, is this how the boomers felt when they discover what LOL is? Dude, but I feel like I agree with you, Crystal, that I don't think this is a real word. Because the only times I've ever
[00:01:59.740] heard this phrase is when people use it to shame other people of like, oh, you don't keep up with the latest Gen Z slang. Like I heard this on, I've been obsessed with the Trisha Paytas podcast recently. I've been like binging all the fucking
[00:02:12.780] episodes and then the co host was telling Trisha like, Oh, no one says LOL anymore. People only say IJBOL but I've never seen it or heard it out in the wild. Dude, same. It's gotta be some sort of conspiracy. Yeah.
[00:02:27.620] Dude, the boomers are just trying to out all the boomers. That's what it really is. But if you do Google it, the first article that pops up is like a New York Times article and it says IJBOL is in LOL is out.
[00:02:41.980] Oh my god. But lowkey, do Gen Z even laugh? Like, I feel like the way they express laughter on TikTok comments is the skull emoji or the crying emoji. They never even say la mal or LOL. So I feel like they don't laugh. That's a really good point.
[00:02:59.140] Dude, are Gen Z kids just not happy? That's so sad. It's also funny because I feel like every time I read anything that's like very Gen Z, a comment or something, I'm always reading it in like some sort of sarcastic tone. True.
[00:03:16.260] Even if it's like them laughing, like the skull emoji, I read that in my head, like sarcastically. If that makes sense. It totally does. I think it is kind of tongue in cheek, maybe maybe not the full sarcasm, but it's just like a little bit more
[00:03:34.220] playful than just a pure laughter. Like LOL to me is like pure laughing, especially when they string LOL in like all caps. I feel like you know, they're actually laughing their ass off. But skull emoji is like, you know, I wouldn't expect them to be laughing. Mm hmm.
[00:03:48.820] Yeah, I don't know. Every time I see the skull emoji, I just think of people saying like, oh, I'm dead. Like that was so funny. I wonder if that's maybe how the skull emoji like originated.
[00:03:57.740] Yeah, I don't know if itchable is gonna be a word that I'll be able to incorporate. Like what if it's like you said, like a trap? It's entrapment. So people know that when you say itchable
[00:04:07.980] that you fell for like the Gen Z. Oh, this is like the latest Gen Z thing. And then that's how they know you're a boomer. Honestly, I could believe it. They're like, yo, let's spread this random ass thing. Yeah. To see who the real boomers are.
[00:04:21.500] Also, it like doesn't roll off the tongue. Yeah. LOL. That's like pretty, you know, solid. You can spell it out. Some people read it like lol. That's also totally fine. But itchable? Like if I were to spell it out, IJBOL. Itchable? You know, it sounds so wrong.
[00:04:39.220] Yeah, it sounds like ethnic kind of. Dude, somebody should cancel the Gen Z kids. I think I will stick to LOL. In my eyes, LOL is superior to itchable. Agreed. All right. Well, enough about how to properly laugh on the
[00:04:58.220] internet. Let's talk about the topic at hand, which Jisoo mentioned earlier. What kind of inspires change in your life? To start us off, I have a question for all of us. What do you feel like is maybe a sign that you recognize where you're
[00:05:16.740] like, I think something needs to change? So I think this can start in a either really mundane way or a really exaggerated way. So I think on like one end of the spectrum is like, let's say you lose your job and your entire
[00:05:31.900] life gets upended. That's a pretty big deal. Yeah, I think that's a pretty clear indicator that something needs to change, right? But I think in our day to day lives, like, usually something like drastic doesn't happen. So I
[00:05:46.540] think it's when you feel really comfortable in your life where you feel like you have a day to day routine, you're doing kind of the same thing every day. And when given the option of spicing things up, you don't really take that. That sort of
[00:06:00.980] been something that I have noticed in my life where I'm like, oh, like I'm not really growing in any particular aspect. And I can see that I'm kind of just coasting by day to day and kind of just turning my brain off.
[00:06:12.660] I feel like I can relate to that too. It's kind of like, the days start to blend together before you know it a month or so has passed and you think to yourself, what have I been doing for the past, you know, month or whatever?
[00:06:24.860] Yeah, it like is really apparent to me when people ask me like, Oh, like, how are you doing? Like, what have you been up to? And I just like stop and think for a second. I'm like, I don't know. All of my days have blended together. I've done
[00:06:34.780] like the same thing for the past month. What have I been up to? That's kind of interesting, because I can definitely see how that could be a sign that you need change in your life. But I think in my life, it manifests slightly differently. So I would
[00:06:50.020] say that I know I need to change something when I keep searching for something that's like more stimulating sort of. And that's not to say it's like always going to be a specific lifestyle or like a party or something like that. But you know, it's
[00:07:07.100] like I feel like there's an outburst kind of waiting to happen under and then that's when I'm like, okay, something's like wrong. So that was probably something that made me start therapy, where I was kind of like, Okay, you know, my life is
[00:07:20.740] fun. Like, I can't say that I'm not having a fun time. Or I can't say that I'm not busy, but I'm just waiting for something to happen or like burst, which is not very good. So like, to me,
[00:07:31.860] that's the way that it shows up as like, something's bubbling under the surface. And I should probably get that taken care of. Is it like, like repressed energy? I need to release my zoomies somehow. Yeah, or it's like, I think you can artificially make your life
[00:07:49.900] feel and seem very fun if you like constantly stack your schedule. But that doesn't mean you're always sorting through the things that you need to sort through. And I think for me, like, that's what something that I default to. And I don't
[00:08:01.860] always have time to like sit down and go through my emotions. So, you know, I could talk about all these things that I've done, but really, the important thing that I should be getting to hasn't been done, which is why I need change.
[00:08:16.100] I have a funny sign because it's very like, outward facing or like physical, I guess versus like an internal feeling. But if my room is like really messy, it means that like, my life is really chaotic or like, not put together right now. And to me,
[00:08:33.900] that means that maybe I'm either overdoing it in some way, or I'm not stimulated enough so that I don't, you know, do these things to like keep my life orderly, I guess. So my room is almost like a reflection of my mind, in a sense, where if it's
[00:08:52.340] organized and good, that means I'm probably in a pretty good space where I have time to do everything that I want to do. But if it's messy, then yeah, like maybe there's like too much going on, I'm not getting to have enough, like alone time mixed
[00:09:09.860] with like, you know, other things. So then that is kind of a more physical sign for maybe not like super big change, but more like life adjustment, rebalancing kind of. Ooh, that's a good one. Yeah, I definitely just took a look at my room as you said that
[00:09:25.500] and I was like, ooh, that's a good point. I think especially as people who use like utilize their bedroom space a lot, whether it's for work or just to chill and hang out, it often is a reflection of their mind state to see like, how organized are
[00:09:42.460] things? Is there sort of a method to the chaos if it is slightly messy, versus like some people who just like don't really care and leave their room messy all the time, right? And yeah, for them, I think they have like so many other things
[00:09:53.980] going on. They don't even think about their room. And I imagine like for people who are homeowners, it would be kind of like the state of your home. Like is your home acceptable for someone to walk in and hang out with you for a
[00:10:05.100] bit? Or is it not? And then that's like kind of a reflection as well. It's true. I think it's also kind of chicken or the egg ish where I feel like sometimes I just set myself up for failure
[00:10:16.380] when my house or like my room isn't clean. Like I can take one glance at my desk and know if I'm gonna have a good week or a bad week, which my desk is usually messy. So maybe that's
[00:10:26.340] a bad sign. But I do think it's interesting that you talk a little bit about like the physical manifestations of needing change. Because I think sometimes if I notice myself wanting to isolate a lot, or if I'm starting to like lash out a
[00:10:41.540] little bit randomly, just like emotionally, then I know like something needs to happen. Or this one is kind of bad. But if I'm like texting or calling my mom a lot, like significantly more than usual, then I know like something is deeply wrong.
[00:10:59.220] I think that makes a lot of sense, though, because then you're trying to like lean on the most comfortable thing. So that would probably or for you, that's like family, parents, stuff like that. So it's like, why do I feel the need to reach back to my
[00:11:13.460] most comfortable state? Right? Yeah, it's interesting that you say that because something that sort of drove me to seek therapy a few years ago, was I felt like I was in this constant state of like, blah. The real word to
[00:11:29.140] describe that is languishing. And it's just kind of where you're in a state of constant, like you don't really care about much. And I was starting to realize that I felt this way when I was going out to like social gatherings or parties, and I was
[00:11:42.420] hanging out with people. And I didn't really feel happy or enjoyment or really anything when I was with people. And I was starting to ask myself, what's going on? Like, why? Why do I feel this way? Why am I not happy hanging out with my
[00:11:56.820] friends? I think my therapist did a really good job of uncovering sort of not only what was driving some of those feelings, but more of the underlying causes. And they're really, really good at making you dig into your childhood to see
[00:12:08.980] like what sort of trauma brought you to this state. Classic therapist asking about your childhood. All of our problems really do stem from childhood. It's kind of crazy. I actually wonder if we're changing truly that much
[00:12:24.500] emotionally in our like mid 20s, or if now we just are a little bit more aware of our feelings and are able to try to articulate what is wrong. Because I feel like I was also an angsty teenager. But back then all of my angst was directed into
[00:12:39.460] some direction. Like I would be like, I fucking hate school, or I'm so mad at my parents or blah, blah, blah. Like there was always some sort of destination, I guess to whatever my angst was. But in adulthood, I feel like things aren't really
[00:12:51.620] that clear cut. Like yes, you could hate your job, or maybe you don't like your living situation. But a lot of the times the vessel that is carrying all these emotions are just yourself. So even if you, you know, enact change in some
[00:13:04.020] way, physically, or environmentally, your body is still kind of coming along with you in that journey. So it is really cool that, you know, there is this big push for us in our 20s to kind of go to therapy and unpack these things to help
[00:13:18.820] you digest everything that's going on emotionally, rather than just thinking in a black and white way like we used to in our teens. For sure. I think also, we often forget that 20s is honestly a really big chunk of our lives that's pretty formative and like
[00:13:35.620] transitional, because we're like just entering more independent times. You know, we're finally out of school for like the first time in our lives. And a lot of things that we do in our 20s, habits that we build and like thoughts that
[00:13:52.900] we have are probably going to set up a lot of our like thought processes and like actions in the future as well. So yeah, I think you're both right, having taking time to really reflect, you know, whether it's by yourself or with a therapist is
[00:14:09.380] just like super helpful because I feel like it's really easy to get lost in your 20s. Like not know what you want to do, not know why you aren't happy or like, you know, why you feel so stuck, things like that.
[00:14:22.820] Totally. Actually, what's interesting is, I guess the way the media portrays therapy is always very like, oh, let's talk about your past. And like, let's talk about this, like clipboard out, you know, going into anecdotes and things like that.
[00:14:37.140] But one of the things that really struck me about going to therapy is the way my therapist kind of, I don't want to say like anti intellectualizes, but, you know, sort of simplifies my emotions in a way. So one of the things she said was, you know,
[00:14:52.340] I was like complaining about how I was feeling really sad and, you know, moping and like, you know, not feeling very encouraged to do anything a couple months ago. And she was like, Oh, do you think it's because it's like wintertime and
[00:15:04.100] there's no sun? Like, have you been going out and like getting sun? And I was like, Well, I don't know if that has anything to do with that. But blah, blah, blah. But then, you know, that week after my session, I was like, taking more walks and kind
[00:15:14.980] of, you know, taking vitamin D pills and like doing stuff that is so things that kind of make me feel like just like an animal, you know, like, like a literal creature. And then I was like, I do feel better. So you know, sometimes I guess change doesn't
[00:15:29.060] have to be so drastic and so deep and serious. Like sometimes it could be something so easy as like, go get more sun. Yeah, definitely. I mean, like seasonal affective disorder is a real thing. Most people just call it seasonal depression. But
[00:15:43.780] I think especially for people who tend to be paler, like vitamin D deficiency is a real source of that type of stuff. I only know this because after I got my physical for the first time in
[00:15:56.500] years, which you're supposed to do more often than I did, I found out that I was vitamin D deficient. So I started taking vitamin D supplements, and like going outside and taking walks, and it definitely improved my mood as well. Vitamin D. Who
[00:16:09.620] knew? I guess relating to seasons, though, do you guys feel like seasons have a big impact on your feelings of wanting change and things like that? Like, maybe in the summer, you feel more inspired to go out and do stuff? Or maybe in fall,
[00:16:24.740] you're like, Oh, this is a fresh start. Like, do you have any feelings associated with these different seasons? Definitely for spring and summer. Sometimes I'll like, look outside. And be like, Oh, you know, it's actually a really
[00:16:37.700] nice day outside, I should like probably go take a walk instead of spending all day gaming inside. Right. And I think the reverse is also true where it could be fall or winter, and you look outside, and it's like really cold and chilly. And you
[00:16:49.060] kind of want to just bundle up at home and not really do any thing. So I can definitely see the lethargy when it's a much colder environment and like much more moody overcast, versus like the sun and warmer days being associated with happier, more productive things.
[00:17:07.060] I feel like for me, the start of a new season always makes me feel like, ooh, like we're in a new quarter, I should clean my room and like do spring cleaning at like the beginning of each
[00:17:21.140] season, kind of. I think it is tied to that whole idea of like, oh, kind of a fresh start to the year, or like part of the year, whether I actually end up doing anything or not, you know,
[00:17:33.140] that depends. But I think it's just kind of a nice way to think about it too. It's like, Oh, you know, maybe I didn't have the best couple months the previous quarter, well, it's going to be
[00:17:43.700] a fresh quarter now. So we can try again or like try some new things, whatever the weather deems appropriate. I really like that, actually. And I feel like it says so much about how the academic schedule impacts us even, you know, like
[00:17:59.700] well into our 20s. Because every year during fall, I'm like, this is the year going to get shit done. And then I think about it. And I'm like, well, this is like the ninth month of
[00:18:08.660] the year. So I don't know why I keep thinking it's the year. But you know, it just feels like a fresh start. And I have this like desire to just plan out things be a little bit more productive. So I definitely do look forward to fall a little
[00:18:21.940] bit. Do that's true. During the summer, I'm always like extra lazy. I'm like, damn, the sun's out, like we should head home. It's really interesting to me that you feel that way during the fall and not during New Year's time, when everyone like
[00:18:41.220] has their New Year's resolutions. And it's like, oh, like I'm gonna change for the year like this is my year, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I feel like I personally, okay, well, I don't really relate to either like the fall or the New Year's
[00:18:53.860] New Year new meeting. Just because like, I'll just keep chugging along on my goals throughout the year. But do you feel like you understand why there's a particular reason you feel that way in the fall versus the New Year?
[00:19:04.580] I think a lot of it has to do with how fall was when the school year used to start like pre college, I guess even through college, that was kind of like the beginning of the school year. But I think also, it's kind of an easier time to
[00:19:17.220] start your goals. Because if you do well, then it's like Christmas time soon. So then you get rewarded for like working on these goals. And if you fuck up, it's still Christmas soon. So it doesn't really matter. So to me, I like having that
[00:19:30.180] insurance of like, there's gonna be a good time soon anyway. But I feel like January starting new goals, then is really daunting. And for me, if I feel like I'm not gonna succeed, then I might be pretty discouraged to even start something.
[00:19:44.900] So then having that full year in front of you with no time to reset until say, September or, you know, basically January, I'm kind of like, Oh, man, I still definitely do my New Year's resolutions. But fall is kind of like that easy
[00:19:58.900] checkpoint, like easy starting mark compared to the seriousness of New Year's goals. I see. That makes sense, like three months left in the year. And that's like enough time to get some some goals crossed off your checklist. Yeah, maybe it's like cramming your goals before January.
[00:20:15.860] That honestly could be it. So procrastination. Exactly. You're like, I'm finally ready to make my New Year's resolution. Nine months into the year. Kind of continuing on the seasonal theme. Do you feel like even though winter and fall usually is more, I guess, quiet
[00:20:38.420] and like stay inside, staying comfortable, like you mentioned, Jeffrey, is it still productive? Even though we're like, you know, maybe spending less time outside of the house on average. I think that depends on your definition of productive or more so what your goals are, right?
[00:20:57.540] Because you can be productive if you set a lot of small, very achievable goals for yourself. And that can be done regardless of the season. Like, if you say I'm gonna clean my room today, I don't really think of what season it is really affects that, right? True.
[00:21:09.460] In terms of like overall productivity, I'm not sure if there's a trend. If I were to assume it probably would tick upwards towards summer and spring. I think that makes sense. And I think actually that question sort of brings me back to the whole
[00:21:23.620] like we as people are animals kinds of theory because I feel like my winter self and my summer self and my fall, like every season, I'm like a different version of myself. And I actually notice it in the types of goals that I make.
[00:21:39.460] So in winter, I feel like January through March, I'm usually not seeing a ton of people. I feel like that's when my social life is the most quiet. So then all of my goals are very like, I'm gonna read this many books
[00:21:50.420] and I'm gonna budget and like take care of my finances and blah, blah. And then I get into the spring and I'm like, okay, this year I want to travel this much. And like every single season, I feel like I have completely
[00:22:01.940] different goals, which sort of makes New Year's resolutions even harder to be honest. But maybe the type of productive I am in each season is kind of different. So then maybe I should be like setting my goals based on that.
[00:22:16.260] Like what if I've been doing this whole time? I'm like now realizing. Quarterly goals. Yeah. Do you think you change within a season or is it easier to like enact change with the change of seasons? I guess as a hypothetical example, maybe it's winter and instead of
[00:22:37.140] enacting change in winter, you're kind of like, oh, once it becomes spring, I'm gonna try to do this stuff. Or in the winter, you're like, oh, you know what? I want to start doing this right now.
[00:22:49.700] I guess it's also tied to like, are you a plan it out a little bit longer or act now kind of person? I think for me personally, when it comes to enacting change, I definitely have to plan it out, but I also sort of scope things out
[00:23:06.180] so that I can start implementing something immediately. I think that's one of the nice things about planning is that you not only outline what's the problem? What are you trying to change and why? You're also looking into what small steps can I take to feel a little
[00:23:24.180] bit productive towards this goal that I have and something that I do when I am trying to plan literally anything out is I will make a goal that says create an outline and write out steps to achieve this goal. And that already makes me feel productive.
[00:23:39.300] That's a good one. Honestly, I think people forget that that in itself is a step that you have to take and once you get it down on paper, you have accomplished something. You've taken the first step.
[00:23:51.860] Yeah, I think people definitely don't realize how hard the first step is. So if you make that first step as small as possible and as achievable as possible, then you're more likely to enact the rest of your change.
[00:24:04.020] So I think I kind of have the opposite problem that I think a lot of people have because I love planning and I hate executing. So if you read through my journal, actually, it's really funny.
[00:24:15.620] I have a lot of like almost like business plans for all my goals. It's like vivid. I can almost envision myself doing all these different steps, but I never got past like step three, basically.
[00:24:26.580] But one of the things that I find sort of interesting when I do look back at my old plans is that I feel like I'm always feeling very emotional when I start to want to embrace the change and like when I do start to plan it out.
[00:24:41.700] And I feel like it's not in a very positive way. Like, I don't know how you guys feel when you sit down and you're like, OK, this is the day I'm going to like sit down and do something.
[00:24:50.980] But for me, every time I look back at like an old plan, I'm like, I'm so fucking tired of living like blah, blah, blah. Like, I hate that my life is like this. So therefore, these are the first steps.
[00:25:03.540] But I feel like if you're a more positive person, it could totally be like, oh, I'm so excited to like, you know, start my new life to achieve this goal. So here are my first steps. Do you guys lean towards a certain side of the spectrum at all?
[00:25:15.060] Maybe there's both like kind of in the middle. Sometimes it's from negative feelings like, oh, every day feels the same. Like I should probably do something about it and like, you know, figure out what I
[00:25:29.460] would want to do and what would maybe bring some change or joy into life. But I think I've also had more positive experiences where it's like, oh, this seems so cool. I think I can incorporate this into my life and it would be a fun thing to do.
[00:25:45.300] I'm trying to think if there's like one I lean towards more. Maybe like right now, at this point in time lately, maybe slightly more negative. It's like, oh, why am I tired all the time? Or like, am I, you know, too filling my plate too much?
[00:26:02.740] Like, do I need to chill? Like kind of that. Yeah, I'm not sure if I lean more towards one side or the other. But I definitely agree with Crystal where there's certain mundane things or things that
[00:26:15.620] feel like chores that I may not be as particularly excited to start enacting change for. But on the flip side, there's also a lot of things where I feel like I have lofty goals for myself that I feel like really excited to make the first step.
[00:26:29.700] Those I think are always the easiest to get started with because you have all this motivation. You have all this drive and passion. And I wish I could sort of reconcile the two and be able to be more disciplined with
[00:26:42.580] myself and be like, okay, I know this thing is going to suck. But I have to change it for the better because I know it sucks right now. So it will get better. But I've just been really bad about doing that because I'm lazy.
[00:26:52.180] Yeah, I have kind of a funny example, I think, that leans more towards negative to neutral. For a while, I really struggled with getting ready to sleep slash getting ready in the morning.
[00:27:09.460] It would be around bedtime and I would kind of crawl into bed and be thinking like, okay, I need to get up and wash my face, brush my teeth, be ready for bed essentially.
[00:27:21.540] But I would just like stare at the bathroom door and be like, dude, that's like so much work. I have to brush my teeth for two whole minutes, wash my face, put lotion on, all of that stuff.
[00:27:34.340] And sometimes it was just like really, really hard to do that. And at first, my thought was, okay, this needs to change. Do I just brute force it? Like go brush my teeth no matter how hard it is? Or is it like something else?
[00:27:51.140] Maybe I'm too overwhelmed at work. Or maybe I'm not stimulated enough in life so that everything feels like a chore. Although my first step solution was not tied to any of that.
[00:28:08.980] I was like, okay, what if I got a water pick and it's a little more fun to brush my teeth and stuff? Or like, yeah, right. I'm like, what if I got new exciting toothpaste or something?
[00:28:24.020] Like just stupid shit like that, which I think did help a little bit. But when I stopped hyper focusing on the fact that I was like struggling to basically get up to brush my teeth and started looking at other aspects of my life, I think it actually helped.
[00:28:42.100] Oh, interesting. So for you, it helped to not hyper focus on the minutiae and look at the little details. But it actually helped you to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:53.220] It's like, oh, I guess I need to make sure my level of mental stimulation in life is at a good level versus too high versus too low. I think that's a really good example. And it's actually something that I've talked to my therapist about where, as always, I
[00:29:14.180] was bitching in therapy one day and I was like, oh, I struggle so hard with this. And it bothers me so much that I can't do this. Blah, blah. And she was like, why do you have no empathy for yourself?
[00:29:26.580] And why do you try to pick out all these things that you hate instead of wondering what is wrong in your situation or maybe what can be helped or changed a little bit to set you up for success?
[00:29:38.420] And sometimes I forget that there are bigger reasons to things like you said. And other times I forget that there's not always only the hard path to walk. So, for example, in a couple of months I'm getting married.
[00:29:53.860] And so we're spending this whole year planning out this wedding, essentially. But I really, really wanted to start this new hobby before the end of the year. And I was telling my therapist about how I felt so overwhelmed, but I really had this passion for something.
[00:30:08.820] And she was like, well, why don't you just wait till next year once the wedding's over? And I was like, I totally forgot you could just do that. And this whole time I was like, how can I balance all 50 things on my plate at the same time?
[00:30:18.740] So it definitely does help, I think, to sort of take a step back and also to just be kinder to yourself when you're thinking about these things and not try to really pressure yourself to do everything all the time perfectly.
[00:30:32.420] That's definitely something that I struggle with is having enough self-compassion and empathy for myself. Because I think growing up as an Asian American kid, it's really easy to be hypercritical of all your failures, even like the little one, just because that's sort of how we were raised, right?
[00:30:47.380] So it's taken a lot of, at least a lot of my 20s to sort of undo that brainwashing I gave myself as a kid. And I think you're right, Jisoo, where it manifests sort of as a, just like a gentle
[00:31:01.460] reminder that you don't have to do all these things at once and you have the ability to prioritize. One of the things that I've sort of heard recently that I really enjoy is that you should
[00:31:11.620] replace the phrase, I don't have time for this in your vocabulary with, I can't prioritize this right now. And it really reshifts the way that you think about your time and the things that you have
[00:31:23.060] to do because now you're not saying like, oh, I can't do this right now. Well, I mean, you kind of are saying like, I can't do this right now, but it's less so
[00:31:29.860] like a, I can't do this right now, but I can get to it when I do X, Y, and Z. Right. I like that kind of like reframing your no into a no but.
[00:31:42.340] I guess it's also instead of just a, you know, hard line, you're like, this is still something I want to do. And it's like a mental reminder. I really like that. It does sound a little corporate, but. Yes, and. I'm a product manager, it's what I do.
[00:32:02.900] I spend all day prioritizing things. But I feel like you're right. Like it's such an important skill to have anyway. I guess sometimes we get so focused on work stuff that we forget.
[00:32:13.540] We can also like shuffle around the priorities in life too and like find that right balance that we've kind of been talking about. So sometimes you just got to pull out the corpse speak and realize that like, you know,
[00:32:27.700] life is also something that you can improve and work on. Oh God, life is work. Life is work. That is true. So I have a question for you both. And it's something that I have mentioned on this podcast that I tend to struggle with.
[00:32:44.420] So I'm also curious if this is something that you guys experience as well. But a lot of the times I think when I am seeking change in my life, it comes from external sources as well as internal.
[00:32:58.660] So, you know, oftentimes I'm like, oh, I don't want to feel like this anymore. So I will enact change. But you know, sometimes it's straight up like I envy what this person has in their life or I think it's really cool that this person does this.
[00:33:11.220] So I want to emulate my life in some way to look like theirs. And I have to guess that this is somewhat common in our 20s. But do you guys ever experience something like this? Yeah, all the time.
[00:33:26.660] I think it's really easy to compare yourself to other people. Not only because that's just literally what happened to us growing up as Asian kids, but also just with how readily available social media is and how people always post the highlights of their lives.
[00:33:42.180] It's really easy to sort of get lost in the rat race of being like, oh, well, I feel like I'm doing well. But then this person is doing like n plus one times better than I am.
[00:33:52.260] Or like this, like I have these life goals, like I wanted to buy a house or get a car. But this person already has all that and a kid. So it's really, really easy to get lost in comparing yourself.
[00:34:04.660] And I've tried really hard to sort of stay away from that side of social media because I know I have these tendencies. So I just don't even allow myself to get into these situations anymore. That's a smart move. I totally agree with everything that Jeffrey said.
[00:34:20.260] And I kind of have been thinking about it lately and started to realize that another layer to all of this, like comparison and social media stuff is that when you see someone who has achieved a certain goal that maybe you want, you're actually envisioning it in
[00:34:39.940] your own terms. But that might not be the way that they achieved it. So I guess an example could be, maybe someone bought this super fancy car. And in your mind, you're like, oh my god, they spent so much money. They bought this car.
[00:34:55.780] But what if they're just leasing it because they got a really good deal or they're borrowing a family car or something like that. And you have no idea because you're just thinking, oh, this is probably how I would achieve that goal.
[00:35:09.380] So that's probably how they achieved that goal. But that's not true. Probably 80% of the time. Yeah, I think that's a really good way of putting it. And you never see what other people are sacrificing. You only see the end result.
[00:35:25.220] And I feel like it's so hard to kind of think in that perspective, at least for me. And something that I've been thinking about a lot lately is I always talk about how I have really bad baby fever and I want to have kids soon.
[00:35:39.700] And if I'm torturing myself now by being jealous of people or constantly thinking and comparing myself to other people's lives, then when I have kids, that kid is going to also have to go through that.
[00:35:53.060] Like, am I going to be the mom that inflicts that onto my kid? And I feel like that gives me a lot of encouragement to try to work on this now and sort of get
[00:36:01.460] ahead of it before I become an actual mother because that's something that I don't want to pass down. Not to say that my parents passed it down to me, but sometimes that is really what happens. So I feel like all these things right now are self-improvement.
[00:36:16.660] But lately, I've been thinking it's not just for myself, but maybe it's for the good of my household or me and my husband or me and my child and things like that. So it gives me a little bit more encouragement to work on it.
[00:36:29.140] Oh, my God, that's such a good point. Because even if you're maybe not directly comparing, say, your child with other people, they could be maybe seeing you comparing yourself with other people and pick up on that. Yeah, kids are really smart. It's terrifying.
[00:36:45.860] They pick up on a lot of minutiae that we don't even think about. And that's sort of one of the things, too, that kind of freaks me out about having a kid in the future is that I want to be a good parent.
[00:36:57.540] And I know what all the lessons I took away from my parents were. And I know all the things that I should and shouldn't do. But I'm worried about the stuff that I've missed. I'm really worried about maybe some of the subconscious behaviors that I have that I
[00:37:10.260] don't even think about that could potentially lead them to having a negative childhood or just a negative experience. Well, the good thing is I feel like since these are thoughts that we think about, that
[00:37:23.220] in itself proves that we are people who would be willing to work on this and improve. And that already is a very good baseline for parenthood, I think. But you're right. It's definitely a scary thought. Children are just so moldable. Yeah.
[00:37:42.360] You know, now that I think about it, it's kind of dumb that you're not like there's no way to practice being a mom before you're a mom. Is there some place you could go to like roleplay being a mom or something like a fake baby
[00:37:56.120] or even like a fake toddler? Because you're right. Like, I feel like there are so many things that, you know, when you're really tired, not getting a ton of sleep, just driving your kid to work.
[00:38:05.640] Like what if you say something that's so normal and so forgettable, but the kid, it's you're their world and it like fucks them up forever. I mean, not to instill more fear in everyone's hearts, but it's like I totally know where you're coming from.
[00:38:18.520] And, you know, even for things like golf, there's like driving ranges where you can go and practice. But I don't know why there isn't anything like that for parenthood. Dude, we need to invent like a VR game and like AI babies, you know? Yeah.
[00:38:34.520] You know, the sad thing is that the people who really need this the most won't do it or like won't look into it because they think that they're going to be great parents. Right?
[00:38:43.640] And on the topic of like practicing parenthood, I have heard from pet owners that it's a great way to see if you're ready for a kid. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Because you sort of go through the same things as raising a child when you're raising a pet.
[00:38:55.960] It's like you have to teach them good behaviors. You have to be relatively attentive to them. You have to look after their needs. Even while yours aren't being met necessarily, you still have to be a good owner for them.
[00:39:09.480] Oh my god, I was actually just talking with some of my friends about that this past weekend. We're like, yeah, if you're a pet owner, you learn to be really selfless and like just exactly what you said, Jeffrey. Like you have to put their needs above yours sometimes.
[00:39:25.800] And also you realize like how much work it is just to take care of another dependent basically. Jesus was like, ah, yes, next year we'll get a dog. So I have another question for us all. And it's kind of like the reverse of what we've been talking about.
[00:39:43.320] So we've been talking about like planning and enacting for change, I guess stemming from just signs that we feel like there might need to be change that we need to start doing.
[00:39:55.800] But has there ever been, I guess like change forced upon you that you know you have to do, but you're kind of scared of it? And then that might lead to like some sort of stagnation or like procrastination on your part?
[00:40:10.840] Or is it like, I guess, or do you like handle it well? Yeah, so I've definitely been in a situation where life sort of just happened and I had to roll with the punches. That was when I got laid off last year.
[00:40:24.440] And one of the things I realized was that I didn't really know why I was still living in the Bay after I got laid off. Because I had moved to the Bay for work. And I almost gaslit myself into thinking like, oh, I should stay here because like
[00:40:38.920] the job opportunities are better. But then with the world sort of moving into more remote and hybrid situations, especially with COVID happening, I sort of asked myself, like, why am I still here?
[00:40:53.080] And the answer I told myself was, well, obviously, like, I love the people I hang out with. I love my friends. And I wanted to stay there for them. But I don't know if it necessarily made sense for me, both in terms of job opportunities
[00:41:04.760] and also financially, because that stuff is really expensive. True. So that was sort of the thing that forced me to think more critically about where I was going to live and why I was living there.
[00:41:17.560] And that's sort of already just added to the stress that I already had about living in the Bay. I don't want to talk too negatively about the Bay because I know a lot of people really enjoy living there and have a lot of awesome friends that live there.
[00:41:31.000] But personally, I just did not have a good experience both with living there when I was employed and also having to deal with the fall of unemployment there. I mean, I feel like the Bay is very like, I guess it's always talked up, hyped up like,
[00:41:47.080] oh, similarly to what you said, like all this job opportunity. It's like a great place to live. It's like a great place to live, all these things. But I guess once you really are there, you're kind of like, okay, this place is so fucking
[00:42:01.800] expensive and everything is so far apart. There's just a lot more cons that are overlooked and it definitely does not fit everyone's personality. And there's also the tech bubble, which I feel like a lot of people who live in the
[00:42:16.680] Bay Area love to hate on or discuss how there's just like certain tech culture there that is, if you're in it, it's great. If you're ignorant about it, that's also great. But if you see it, it's just like something that's really in your face and you're like,
[00:42:34.360] okay, this is quite weird if you really stop to think about it. Yeah, definitely. So I don't blame you for having some dislike for the Bay. I feel like there's a lot of people who grew up in the Bay who can probably also sympathize
[00:42:49.240] with that where there's just certain aspects that you don't love and are not super great. And you're like, okay, why is the Bay always talked up so much? Like so disproportionately so. Yeah, it feels like one of those things where you visit a place for vacation, you think
[00:43:07.560] you want to live there and you're sort of going in with rose-tinted glasses because you're on vacation, right? You're having a good time and you're really enjoying it. And then once you move in, that's sort of when reality sets in. And I think that's definitely the same case.
[00:43:22.840] That's the same thing with the Bay Area where I've heard a lot of people talk it up. There's all this to talk about innovation, entrepreneurship, and all that stuff. But the reality of living there is really quite mundane.
[00:43:35.560] And the tech culture, as you mentioned, is also very in your face. As someone who worked in tech, I could not believe how loud some people were about it. It's kind of crazy. I have a funny mini anecdote about tech culture here.
[00:43:52.280] So last night, I went to a party of people that I didn't really know. And a lot of them were a couple years younger, probably at least three years or so younger.
[00:44:01.800] And the first thing we see when we walk in was there was someone on the couch and he had his laptop open. And mind you, there's like 30 people in this house. Everyone's talking and drinking and having a good time.
[00:44:14.280] And then he was just on chat GPT for 20 minutes. And I was like, this is so Bay Area. And it's just so funny. And it's the perfect anecdote. It's like that I feel isn't uncommon. It's hilarious.
[00:44:26.440] But it is something that probably people would see at different sorts of social settings. So totally get what you mean about tech culture, especially since I myself don't work in tech. I find it hilarious. And I love to point it out anytime I see it.
[00:44:41.800] So wait, what was he doing on chat GPT? I'm so curious. I don't know. There were like a lot of people just sitting around and playing cards. And he was just like on chat GPT. Because like, how do I interact at a party?
[00:44:54.520] Yeah, like how do I navigate social situations? And it's really not to say I'm the most social person because if you know me, you know, I'm hella awkward and have social anxiety. But that to me is just peak Bay Area. It really is. It really is.
[00:45:09.640] Yeah, I will say it's nice because I thought I was like really socially awkward and shy. But man, there have been some people that make me feel really good about myself. I feel like a funny thing about the Bay Area is that almost every stereotype you hear,
[00:45:23.960] whether it's like a positive or a negative stereotype is probably true. Like you'll probably be able to find it. The amount of Patagucci that I've seen is insane. Although I hear that Patagonia isn't like the like what's in with tech people anymore. It's now all about architects.
[00:45:41.080] It's actually also because Patagonia a couple years ago made a new rule, they refuse to embroider company logos on their clothes. Now, their official reason is because it makes it harder to recycle the clothes because they do like you know how you can return some Patagonia clothes
[00:46:00.520] to get sold on there like worn wear or whatever. So that's like one of the excuses. But I think also they're probably sick of having that reputation when Patagonia is actually really good for what they're actually made for like hiking and like nature stuff.
[00:46:17.640] Yeah, there's been so many times where James and I will go out to grab food and then we'll like be seated next to a bunch of tech bros and they're like literally screaming about how much money they make, how much they've made on crypto or whatever.
[00:46:30.680] And I'm just like listening to them the whole time. Me and James aren't even talking anymore, we're just listening to them. That has happened to me so many times where I've been just grabbing dinner somewhere.
[00:46:41.160] I think the first time it happened to me, I was in downtown Mountain View. We're on Castro just getting dinner and I hear all these tech people talking about Kubernetes, like the newest tech stack, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:50.520] And I'm like, dude, it's like 8pm, shouldn't we be enjoying dinner? Like why are you still talking about work? Seriously, it's always really good for people who have spent a long time living in the Bay
[00:47:02.360] to spend even just like an internship, like a couple months outside of the Bay to regain some perspective because it's so easy to get stuck in that tech bubble. And I guess to tie it back in with the idea of change,
[00:47:16.760] sometimes it's hard to see these signs because you're so used to your day-to-day life that you don't realize you're missing out on what's happening with the rest of the world. You're losing touch with reality kind of. Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:47:31.320] And I know earlier, Jeffrey, you also mentioned that in some ways you were almost gaslighting yourself into thinking, no, it's fine for me to stay here. Maybe I'll get over these feelings or maybe it's just me, things like that.
[00:47:43.240] And I feel like sometimes there is a certain path that is probably ideal for you in your situation. But I feel like a lot of the times we might not want to walk that path because change is scary.
[00:47:54.840] And having to kind of deal with all of that on top of the stress of finding a new job, things like that, I can imagine is very overwhelming. So for me personally, I think my fear of change is one of the biggest
[00:48:07.320] things that stopped me from having more change in my life where I'm like, this is so routine. Like if I don't change anything, I don't have to do anything. So the lazy girl in me is like, this is the best.
[00:48:18.360] But in the long run, the earlier you enact change, the better it might be. Or maybe you'll see more opportunities and experience more things. So it's definitely something that I find challenging in my daily life. I think that's true for most people.
[00:48:31.800] I think change is really scary because we're so used to being comfortable. And I think the biggest thing is that with change, there brings some level of uncertainty and that terrifies our little monkey brains. Yeah, really good point.
[00:48:49.480] And we kind of mentioned this earlier in the episode too, that sometimes change doesn't even have to be super big. You can start with something pretty small and then from there it can snowball or just like
[00:49:04.520] maybe even a small tweak is what you needed instead of just immediately jumping to the biggest thing. So I will admit that in the past, there's been moments where at work I was thinking like, oh, do I like my job?
[00:49:20.040] Do I like the people that I work with? And then I'm like, damn, maybe it's me. Maybe I'm too awkward. Okay, the solution is just get a new job. But reasonably you could also just try a little harder to interact with the people.
[00:49:36.520] Sometimes you're the one holding yourself back from asking a random co-worker to have lunch with instead of jumping all the way to being like, okay, I should start brushing off my resume and looking for a brand new job.
[00:49:51.720] Yeah, on that note, it is so easy to spiral in your thoughts. And that's one of the best takeaways I had from therapy, which was how to remove myself from a situation like that when you're in a state of really intense emotions,
[00:50:08.200] you're not going to have the most logical thoughts. So the best thing to do for yourself is always to step away, go outside, take a walk, just catch your breath and then come back with a more sound mind and really reassess like, okay, what is the issue here?
[00:50:24.600] Do I really need to find a new job or am I just the problem? Yeah, exactly. And you know what? Most of the time it might just be you're the problem.
[00:50:34.520] As like fucked up as that sounds, I feel like it's kind of a real thought to have because just comparing like finding new job versus trying a little harder to interact with people, finding new job you personally don't have to change because you're just changing your environment
[00:50:55.480] versus like taking the steps to try a little harder to interact with people. That's like making yourself kind of grow. And then I guess if that doesn't work out, then you can figure something else out. But at least you worked on yourself first before immediately just
[00:51:10.280] blaming everything else and like doing something that is very external. I think one other thing too that a lot of people don't really think about or kind of forget to realize is that you only really grow when you put yourself outside
[00:51:25.080] of your comfort zone and change is very uncomfortable. That's sort of why you are able to grow a lot from changing something in your life. The sooner you realize and you acknowledge that whatever you're about to do is going
[00:51:37.400] to make you really uncomfortable, the faster you can actually act upon it. Oh my god, that's kind of scary. New phobia unlocked. Not to make like any change like super daunting in your life, right?
[00:51:51.480] It's just like it's just one of the realities that we kind of have to live with. I mean, maybe if you enact change so much, you're just used to it. And then you'll be a pro at changing.
[00:52:05.960] Yeah, I mean, I know people, a lot of people who have heavy growth mindsets who I think the change doesn't bother them so much because they're more hyper focused on what about themselves they're changing.
[00:52:17.880] So the fact that like what they're about to do is really uncomfortable doesn't even bother them anymore. So I think there is some level of normalcy, I guess with it if you do it a lot.
[00:52:27.480] Yeah, I think a lot of this conversation is making me realize that change feels like it's something very dramatic and something that requires a lot of planning and a lot of prep and a lot of emotional prep, of course.
[00:52:40.280] But the more I talk to you both about it, the more I realize maybe a lot of change is like being in tune with yourself first. And that way you can have a smoother transition, you can be a little bit less scared of change,
[00:52:53.320] and you can also feel when and what kind of change you actually need in your life. So it's definitely been really interesting talking to you both about it. I feel like my fear of change has like grown slightly, but I think I also understand it
[00:53:07.080] a little bit more conceptually. So, you know, net positive. But thank you both for talking about such a big topic of transition in our lives, especially in our mid 20s. So for any of our listeners out there, if you want to hit us up about your tips and
