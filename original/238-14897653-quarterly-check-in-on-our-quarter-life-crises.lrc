[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal.
[00:00:16.000] We're back with some life updates. And personally, my life updates are more like crises.
[00:00:24.000] Same. And I don't know what it is about this year, but I feel like now that we've wrapped up Q1, not to go all corporate,
[00:00:33.000] but this year just feels a little bit different to me. I don't know if it's our age or just how many years it's been since we've left high school or things like that,
[00:00:41.000] but I just feel so many things all the time.
[00:00:45.000] Oh my God. Yeah, I totally agree. My theory right now, which kind of ties into my crisis is that we're kind of at the age where no one needs to tell us what to do anymore.
[00:00:59.000] And so we don't know.
[00:01:02.000] Like we're kind of just feeling around and we're like, oh shoot, life is different now. We don't just do whatever society tells us anymore.
[00:01:11.000] We have much more freedom. So that's kind of how I've been feeling lately.
[00:01:17.000] I'm trying to like lead my most authentic life and basically do things that I want to do.
[00:01:23.000] And I realized that our whole life leading up to early to mid-20s, a lot of it is kind of predetermined as in our parents wanted us to go to school,
[00:01:35.000] you know, go to college, get a degree. Generally, us and our friends followed that path and then, you know, get a job.
[00:01:41.000] And then after that, it's like, okay now I don't know what to do anymore.
[00:01:45.000] Yeah, it's kind of interesting because I know a couple episodes ago we talked about how everyone's paths kind of diverging off in our mid-20s
[00:01:54.000] gives us the empowerment and the ability to be really appreciating our own lives and not comparing ourselves to others.
[00:02:01.000] But I do feel like the opposite end of that spectrum is okay, I am no longer getting handheld on every step of my life.
[00:02:10.000] So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[00:02:12.000] Exactly. That is how I'm feeling a lot of these days now because I'm like, okay, well, you know, I get up, I go to work, come home,
[00:02:23.000] I don't know, like watch some TV or something and then eventually like wrap up, go to sleep.
[00:02:29.000] And then I'm like, oh, I guess like I should probably be doing more, right?
[00:02:34.000] I know what you mean. I feel like I'm always vacillating between I'm not doing enough and like I'm doing too much.
[00:02:40.000] And I just constantly like seesaw back and forth between those two feelings.
[00:02:44.000] Yeah, and I think one big thing that I'm starting to practice out of all this is to really think about if what I'm doing is what I want.
[00:02:54.000] So literally like rethinking everything in life.
[00:02:59.000] I know it sounds dramatic, but I think it's kind of necessary.
[00:03:03.000] So to go through all the basics, first one is probably work because that takes up the majority of our lives right now.
[00:03:11.000] Is this a job that I want? And is this a job that still brings joy?
[00:03:16.000] And if it's not, why am I in this job?
[00:03:20.000] Is it because someone else told me to be in it?
[00:03:22.000] Is it because, you know, I'm satisfying someone else's expectation of myself when I should be satisfying my own expectation of myself?
[00:03:32.000] That's a really big one, especially for our age.
[00:03:35.000] And I feel like especially now that we're going back into the office and stuff and work is taking up a bigger majority of our lives,
[00:03:42.000] it does feel like more of an essential question.
[00:03:44.000] Like do I get along with my coworkers? Do I like this team? Do I like these projects?
[00:03:48.000] Do I feel fulfilled by the things that I do?
[00:03:50.000] And if not, then what's next? Like what are next steps basically?
[00:03:54.000] Exactly. I actually talked to my therapist about this a lot.
[00:03:58.000] She explained to me like, you don't have to make big changes all the time as well.
[00:04:03.000] If you're starting to realize that a certain aspect of life isn't what you want,
[00:04:08.000] she basically described this pretty interesting analogy to me.
[00:04:12.000] Right now in life, you're basically in a cereal aisle and you can try anything you want.
[00:04:18.000] Like no one's stopping you except for yourself, pretty much.
[00:04:22.000] You don't have to suddenly take a jump from like Cheerios to like Cookie Crisps,
[00:04:29.000] something that's like completely out of your realm.
[00:04:31.000] You can definitely stick to one genre I guess of cereal and try new things within there
[00:04:39.000] before considering moving on and trying a different type of cereal.
[00:04:46.000] So she was like, you know, you don't have to make any rash decisions right now,
[00:04:49.000] but you should definitely evaluate if the things you're doing is what you want
[00:04:53.000] and if you want to try new things.
[00:04:55.000] I was like, huh, I guess that makes a lot of sense.
[00:04:59.000] So we should look for our honey nut Cheerios so much essentially.
[00:05:04.000] Yeah. I like that analogy a lot because I feel like if you think about the logistics behind every decision,
[00:05:10.000] it can sometimes like tie you down to staying in the status quo.
[00:05:13.000] If I want to go back to grad school, for example,
[00:05:16.000] I feel like my brain instantly goes to, oh, how many years of income am I losing out on
[00:05:20.000] or will this truly benefit me or what's the return after X number of years?
[00:05:25.000] Like who's going to pay the bills while I'm in school or things like that.
[00:05:28.000] But I feel like it doesn't always have to be so drastic like your therapist said.
[00:05:32.000] And I feel like it's a good way to kind of remind yourself that little decisions can eventually add up too.
[00:05:37.000] So it doesn't have to be one huge change.
[00:05:39.000] It can be small choices day by day.
[00:05:41.000] Exactly.
[00:05:42.000] I've been reevaluating my life.
[00:05:45.000] And I feel like that really makes me feel like I'm going through just a long standing quarter life crisis.
[00:05:53.000] I think at one point I was talking to my therapist.
[00:05:57.000] I was like, oh my God, I'm having a quarter life crisis, aren't I?
[00:06:00.000] And she was like, well, I wouldn't call it a crisis.
[00:06:03.000] Like you're still functioning okay.
[00:06:05.000] So, you know, I was like, oh, okay.
[00:06:08.000] But like I'm still having this crisis.
[00:06:11.000] Dude, I feel like you're right though.
[00:06:13.000] This is the perfect age because I think until you really hit your late 20s,
[00:06:18.000] you're kind of just like fighting for your life,
[00:06:20.000] like really learning how to be a worker,
[00:06:22.000] like learning what it's like to live without your parents
[00:06:25.000] and like all these things that you're kind of getting used to.
[00:06:28.000] And I feel like now we're just like used to it.
[00:06:30.000] So then your brain wanders and I'm like, what can I fix?
[00:06:33.000] Like what do I need to change?
[00:06:35.000] Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:37.000] And a couple of episodes we talked about partying
[00:06:40.000] and having a check-in with yourself.
[00:06:43.000] You know that moment when you go to the bathroom
[00:06:45.000] and you look at yourself in the mirror,
[00:06:47.000] you're like am I okay right now?
[00:06:49.000] I feel like I'm having that right now,
[00:06:51.000] but in the concept of life...
[00:06:55.000] Like you're in life's bathroom right now.
[00:06:57.000] Yes, and I'm looking at myself like, am I okay right now?
[00:07:01.000] What is the next step?
[00:07:02.000] I'm like talking to myself
[00:07:04.000] and giving myself a pep talk for what the next step is.
[00:07:08.000] And I've thought a lot about it
[00:07:10.000] and I think I have come to an interesting realization.
[00:07:13.000] Right now I'm living at home with my parents
[00:07:15.000] and I have been ever since I moved back from New York.
[00:07:18.000] It's been really nice because it's like
[00:07:20.000] I get to spend time with my family.
[00:07:22.000] They're really easy to live with.
[00:07:24.000] We all are kind of introverts so we just do our own thing
[00:07:27.000] and they're not super naggy to me.
[00:07:30.000] But as I reflect on where I am in life
[00:07:35.000] and kind of having that mirror moment with myself,
[00:07:38.000] I'm like oh I'm literally about to be 28
[00:07:41.000] and I'm living at home
[00:07:44.000] and it's kind of like those stereotypes from when we were younger.
[00:07:48.000] It's like oh I don't want to be that 30 year old
[00:07:50.000] still living in my parents basement,
[00:07:52.000] that kind of thing.
[00:07:54.000] Which I feel like it's different
[00:07:56.000] in this current economic climate nowadays,
[00:07:59.000] especially in the Bay Area where living at home with your parents
[00:08:02.000] is a lot more common.
[00:08:04.000] But it does kind of give you that sense like oh shoot,
[00:08:07.000] maybe I'm missing out on other parts of life.
[00:08:10.000] So I thought about it.
[00:08:11.000] I was like okay pros and cons,
[00:08:13.000] staying at home, saving money versus moving out sooner
[00:08:16.000] and maybe slowing down the saving process.
[00:08:20.000] And what I've kind of come to the conclusion of
[00:08:23.000] is that in New York I was building a certain momentum in life
[00:08:27.000] but then coming back to the Bay,
[00:08:29.000] I kind of fell off that track
[00:08:31.000] or like I paused the momentum
[00:08:33.000] because readjusting to the Bay,
[00:08:36.000] living at home, kind of reverting to like an old self
[00:08:40.000] versus becoming a new self.
[00:08:43.000] I had a talk with my parents
[00:08:45.000] and I was like I might try to move out by the end of the year
[00:08:48.000] and they were like oh you don't want to keep saving money at home?
[00:08:54.000] But they take the news well generally?
[00:08:57.000] Yes, I had to pull out some tactics to convince them a little bit.
[00:09:04.000] One I was like oh dude like you know most of our friends
[00:09:08.000] like family friends as well as my high school or college friends
[00:09:11.000] don't really live at home anymore.
[00:09:13.000] It's really good for growing your independence
[00:09:15.000] and responsibility, all those kinds of excuses.
[00:09:19.000] And they're like hmm okay but at this point
[00:09:22.000] they were still like a little skeptical right?
[00:09:24.000] Because they're like dude you could just save at home
[00:09:26.000] and then I know your goal eventually was to like you know purchase property
[00:09:30.000] and then I was like dude but like the HOAs right now are fucking insane
[00:09:36.000] not to mention the high like mortgage rates.
[00:09:40.000] I also told them and I think this one kind of shook them a bit.
[00:09:44.000] I was like hey when you were 28
[00:09:47.000] you both got married and moved out of the country.
[00:09:50.000] Whoa, damn you used their past against them.
[00:09:56.000] They kind of went quiet after that and they were like oh okay.
[00:10:02.000] So you successfully broke up with them as roommates?
[00:10:05.000] Yes exactly.
[00:10:08.000] But they were kind of like oh but like no rush to leave right?
[00:10:12.000] And I was like yeah sure.
[00:10:14.000] And my mom was like since your goal is to live alone
[00:10:16.000] make sure you find like a safe neighborhood blah blah blah
[00:10:19.000] and I was like yeah yeah you know of course don't worry about it.
[00:10:23.000] Well that is a very exciting culmination of the quarter life crisis that you've been having.
[00:10:28.000] A lot of self reflection and facing reality maybe?
[00:10:34.000] I think that's an interesting way to put it and I am first of all very excited for you
[00:10:39.000] and I'm also curious to see what kind of new chapter this will open up in your life
[00:10:43.000] if it'll make it easier for you to feel in tune with yourself
[00:10:47.000] and your priorities and your decisions if it'll open up new doors etc.
[00:10:51.000] So hopefully all of those things come true.
[00:10:54.000] Hopefully and hopefully it'll happen sooner than later.
[00:10:59.000] I gave myself till the end of the year to not feel too rushed
[00:11:02.000] but you know I kind of am very like sporadic sometimes
[00:11:07.000] like the New York move was like within two weeks alright I'm out of here
[00:11:12.000] but now it's like oh shoot did I give myself too long of a timeline?
[00:11:16.000] Like can't become complacent in the middle of this?
[00:11:19.000] It's okay maybe you'll surprise yourself.
[00:11:22.000] So I'm thinking of my personal quarter life crisis
[00:11:25.000] and I feel like it's almost like two sides of the same coin
[00:11:29.000] where I am also thinking about my decisions in life
[00:11:34.000] but I feel like the feeling that I've been having is
[00:11:39.000] I just feel so chased all the time
[00:11:41.000] whether I feel chased on time, chased on obligations
[00:11:45.000] all of these different things and I just always feel like I'm running
[00:11:49.000] or like sprinting maybe is the better word
[00:11:52.000] and I think it's just like freaking me out a little bit
[00:11:55.000] because I'm like I have all these things that I need to do
[00:11:58.000] which I feel like it's constantly on my mind
[00:12:00.000] because I'm just that kind of a person
[00:12:02.000] but the execution side of me is very weak
[00:12:06.000] and I have like this long to-do list
[00:12:08.000] and I just can't bring myself to like lock in
[00:12:11.000] and sit down and do all these things
[00:12:13.000] and I think coupled with this feeling of like oh god there's so much to do
[00:12:18.000] is always that nagging feeling of how come everyone else looks like they're doing fine
[00:12:25.000] and I'm the only one who's like freaked out by all this shit on my to-do list
[00:12:30.000] no one else seems like they're freaking out
[00:12:32.000] people are getting stuff done in life
[00:12:34.000] going traveling and you know moving jobs
[00:12:37.000] and going back to school and doing all these things fine
[00:12:40.000] but for me when it comes to my to-do list
[00:12:43.000] I feel like every single day goes by
[00:12:45.000] and I'm not checking off like a single task
[00:12:48.000] maybe you have big goals
[00:12:52.000] I think that could definitely be true
[00:12:54.000] but there's just something about all these things that I want to do
[00:12:59.000] where I think I'm just so freaked out
[00:13:01.000] and so like panicked by everything
[00:13:03.000] that even the small tasks I'm like unable to touch them
[00:13:08.000] because I think the logic is like oh there's this way more urgent thing that I should do
[00:13:14.000] so the small task I am going to push it aside
[00:13:17.000] but then it leads to like nothing being done basically
[00:13:20.000] and I think it's getting to the point where
[00:13:23.000] even things that like bring me joy
[00:13:26.000] or normally would slash should
[00:13:28.000] are starting to feel like obligations to me
[00:13:31.000] because I just don't have like mental space
[00:13:33.000] damn
[00:13:34.000] so like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed about everything
[00:13:37.000] yeah exactly
[00:13:38.000] and I think this ties me in to like
[00:13:42.000] something that you were talking about
[00:13:44.000] of like how do I know what I really want to do
[00:13:48.000] or like how do I know how I'm feeling
[00:13:50.000] like how do I check in with myself constantly
[00:13:53.000] I think I just don't have that check-in time
[00:13:56.000] or that check-in capacity right now
[00:13:59.000] and it's making me think of everything as like an obligation
[00:14:04.000] when in reality I feel like life is not like that
[00:14:06.000] it's like some things are obligations
[00:14:08.000] other things are fun things
[00:14:09.000] other things are like building blocks
[00:14:11.000] to drive momentum for another goal etc etc
[00:14:14.000] but right now I think everything just feels like an obligation
[00:14:18.000] and I'm like I don't know how to snap out of this
[00:14:21.000] like I don't know how to not feel guilty all the time
[00:14:23.000] I just don't know
[00:14:25.000] dude maybe you need a true vacation
[00:14:28.000] okay this is a fantasy of mine
[00:14:30.000] which is just like to take a week off
[00:14:33.000] you know burn through a bunch of PTO
[00:14:35.000] but literally do nothing
[00:14:37.000] like not travel or anything
[00:14:39.000] but like literally just relax for a few days
[00:14:42.000] whether that mean at home
[00:14:44.000] well it probably means at home
[00:14:46.000] like you know sleep in
[00:14:48.000] have no responsibility
[00:14:50.000] for longer than a weekend
[00:14:52.000] dude yeah I feel like that's the dream
[00:14:54.000] and even that is like a good way to describe how I'm feeling
[00:14:58.000] it's like I feel like I have to maximize my PTO always
[00:15:02.000] like I have to maximize this
[00:15:04.000] if I have a free weekend I have to get all these things done
[00:15:07.000] and I think a lot of it is sort of like perfectionism in a sense
[00:15:11.000] which is so ironic because
[00:15:14.000] I'm not a perfectionist like when it comes down to it
[00:15:17.000] so I don't know why in terms of like schedule management
[00:15:20.000] I just always have to like fill it up with shit
[00:15:24.000] but I'm just overwhelmed and I'm like freaking out
[00:15:27.000] and I you know because I've been so busy
[00:15:30.000] or at least feeling like I'm so busy
[00:15:33.000] I've also been unable to talk to my therapist
[00:15:36.000] so then what's been happening is
[00:15:39.000] instead of working out my problems like a normal person
[00:15:42.000] I just have fucking nightmares about all the things that are going on
[00:15:45.000] dude
[00:15:47.000] that's the worst the stress dreams
[00:15:50.000] I know it's so bad
[00:15:52.000] I feel like the way our society is run
[00:15:56.000] slash like the way it functions right now
[00:15:59.000] totally can lead to this feeling as well
[00:16:02.000] because I often think about it how we literally work
[00:16:06.000] you know five days a week nine to five
[00:16:09.000] and after work we're pretty tired you know we've been using our brain
[00:16:12.000] we've been you know talking to our coworkers
[00:16:15.000] all that stuff so you're pretty tired after work
[00:16:18.000] and now that we go into the office a few days
[00:16:21.000] sometimes that nine to five gets a little extended
[00:16:24.000] because we have to sit through traffic
[00:16:26.000] and then you only have so many hours left in the day
[00:16:29.000] but you're not fully yourself anymore
[00:16:32.000] we kind of just succumb to the easy stuff
[00:16:35.000] you know watching some easy to watch TV
[00:16:38.000] or you know playing some mindless games
[00:16:40.000] or something of that sort
[00:16:42.000] then we wake up and do it again
[00:16:44.000] and then we have the weekends where that's where we like shove all our social responsibilities
[00:16:49.000] hang out with friends
[00:16:51.000] and it's like sometimes hard to have a minute to like catch your breath
[00:16:55.000] so I totally know what you mean
[00:16:57.000] and then I can totally see how this would build up over time
[00:17:00.000] so then eventually you just feel like exactly how you described
[00:17:04.000] you're always just like chasing something
[00:17:06.000] or being chased
[00:17:08.000] but you're like when can I catch my breath
[00:17:10.000] yeah I think that's like totally a big part of it
[00:17:14.000] I think also like some of it probably does live with myself as well
[00:17:18.000] I take responsibility for not knowing how to prioritize
[00:17:21.000] I think that's the big thing
[00:17:23.000] it's like I want to do everything
[00:17:25.000] but in reality you only have so many hours in the day
[00:17:27.000] so you just like pick and choose certain things
[00:17:30.000] and then stuff that's not as important or as key
[00:17:33.000] you push that off or you prioritize it later on a different day
[00:17:37.000] but I think for me it's really hard to do that
[00:17:40.000] so then I just end up doing everything poorly
[00:17:43.000] and I was talking to James about this
[00:17:46.000] because I think he is very good at prioritizing
[00:17:50.000] he doesn't feel a ton of guilt when he has to de-prioritize things
[00:17:55.000] versus for me I feel heavy guilt
[00:17:57.000] because I've been unable to see my therapist
[00:17:59.000] he's like my pseudo therapist right now unfortunately
[00:18:02.000] and he basically was like why would you even want to show up
[00:18:06.000] to certain things or try to tackle certain things
[00:18:09.000] when you're not feeling like 100% capacity
[00:18:12.000] because that's just gonna make that hangout not fun for your friend
[00:18:16.000] or you're gonna end up putting half effort into whatever tasks
[00:18:19.000] that you're doing and that task might be important too right
[00:18:22.000] he was like you just need to like rest more
[00:18:24.000] and then like pick like one or two things
[00:18:26.000] and then just like do that
[00:18:28.000] otherwise what's gonna happen is what I mentioned earlier
[00:18:31.000] you're gonna do everything poorly
[00:18:33.000] and I was kind of thinking about it
[00:18:35.000] and I was like fucking facts
[00:18:37.000] because recently I went to hang out with a really close friend
[00:18:41.000] and I felt like the entire time we were hanging out
[00:18:43.000] instead of catching up about life
[00:18:45.000] I spent like I don't know maybe like 10 minutes
[00:18:47.000] like bitching about how I felt so busy
[00:18:50.000] and felt so overwhelmed and blah blah blah
[00:18:52.000] and it did feel somewhat good to get it off my chest
[00:18:56.000] but on the other hand I was like
[00:18:58.000] that's such a waste of time
[00:19:00.000] like I don't want to negatively affect other people
[00:19:04.000] with how I'm feeling overwhelmed
[00:19:06.000] I would much rather if I were to go do that hangout again
[00:19:09.000] which I guess is not that big of a deal
[00:19:11.000] because I see this person somewhat often
[00:19:13.000] but you know I would rather spend that 10 minutes
[00:19:16.000] like talking about something else
[00:19:17.000] or catching up about her life
[00:19:19.000] or you know things like that
[00:19:20.000] so then I guess I just felt like
[00:19:23.000] if I don't get this prioritizing thing straight soon
[00:19:28.000] I'm just gonna be like a Debbie Downer
[00:19:30.000] or like a negative Nancy at like everything I do
[00:19:32.000] in the next couple of months
[00:19:34.000] oh no
[00:19:35.000] it's okay I'm sure your friend appreciated
[00:19:38.000] hearing about your life update
[00:19:40.000] even though it was a little negative
[00:19:43.000] it was literally like over a lot of times
[00:19:45.000] I was like I just fucking care about it
[00:19:47.000] I wasn't crying but internally I was
[00:19:51.000] and you know I think it's reasonable too
[00:19:53.000] because like sometimes
[00:19:55.000] someone else is going through a tougher time
[00:19:57.000] sometimes you're going through a tougher time
[00:19:59.000] so it's okay to slip up here and there
[00:20:03.000] although I wouldn't even call it slip up
[00:20:05.000] I would just call it like you know this time
[00:20:07.000] you're sharing your negative thoughts
[00:20:09.000] next time maybe they'll share
[00:20:11.000] and maybe the next time after that
[00:20:13.000] you both share like happy thoughts
[00:20:15.000] that's true
[00:20:16.000] but I do get what you mean
[00:20:18.000] like you don't want your mind to be so consumed
[00:20:21.000] by the negative thoughts
[00:20:22.000] and then like kind of loom over
[00:20:24.000] like if there was a way to share the negative thoughts
[00:20:26.000] but happily right
[00:20:29.000] I just wish I could put the part of my brain
[00:20:32.000] that's like consumed by feeling so busy
[00:20:35.000] and being freaked out by being busy
[00:20:37.000] and just like make that part of my brain
[00:20:39.000] actually do shit
[00:20:40.000] because then I'll be less busy
[00:20:42.000] theoretically
[00:20:44.000] I mean but if you're overwhelmed
[00:20:46.000] it's hard to do anything
[00:20:47.000] yeah that's true
[00:20:48.000] the trap
[00:20:50.000] you know I think it's really funny too though
[00:20:52.000] we both shared how we're having like
[00:20:54.000] pretty big I guess life evaluation
[00:20:57.000] worthy moments
[00:20:59.000] and also what's funny is we've been chatting
[00:21:02.000] and I recently told you I was like
[00:21:04.000] oh my god I'm like addicted to the Sims right now
[00:21:06.000] the game
[00:21:07.000] and then you were like yeah
[00:21:09.000] I'm like so addicted to TFT right now too
[00:21:11.000] and I'm just like
[00:21:13.000] this is our issue is manifesting
[00:21:15.000] in a distraction
[00:21:17.000] dude I was just thinking about that actually
[00:21:19.000] because I feel like
[00:21:21.000] whenever there's all these things going wrong in life
[00:21:23.000] I can only put my energy into one
[00:21:25.000] or two things
[00:21:26.000] and the thing that is going well in life
[00:21:28.000] is my fucking TFT addiction
[00:21:31.000] which is so bad
[00:21:32.000] the world is crashing and burning
[00:21:34.000] but like your TFT
[00:21:36.000] first every time
[00:21:39.000] I'm climbing the ring
[00:21:41.000] and I've been keeping up with my gym
[00:21:43.000] like my like workout schedule
[00:21:45.000] which is good that's good
[00:21:46.000] that means everything else in my life
[00:21:47.000] is fucking going poorly so
[00:21:50.000] yeah every time I play the Sims now
[00:21:52.000] I'm like oh my god
[00:21:53.000] if only life was as easy as the Sims
[00:21:55.000] like dude just open up the cheats tab
[00:21:57.000] and type in motherload
[00:21:59.000] that's like a free 50k right there
[00:22:01.000] oh my god
[00:22:03.000] and then like going to school
[00:22:04.000] and stuff in Sims
[00:22:05.000] all you have to do is like
[00:22:06.000] do homework for an hour
[00:22:07.000] dude you're good
[00:22:10.000] why isn't life so easy
[00:22:12.000] like truly
[00:22:13.000] yeah I sometimes wish
[00:22:15.000] life was as easy as controlling a sim
[00:22:18.000] so this heavy shit aside
[00:22:20.000] I did have some like random realizations recently
[00:22:22.000] that I do feel like
[00:22:24.000] is making me feel more in tune with myself
[00:22:27.000] and just more connected with myself
[00:22:29.000] and I don't know why
[00:22:31.000] it took me like five years of working
[00:22:33.000] to come to this realization
[00:22:35.000] but I just realized
[00:22:37.000] that in meetings with people
[00:22:39.000] like camera on meetings
[00:22:41.000] you don't always have to be smiling
[00:22:43.000] oh my god
[00:22:45.000] maybe it's because
[00:22:47.000] usually in meetings I was always
[00:22:49.000] like on the younger end
[00:22:51.000] or maybe it's just my burning desire
[00:22:53.000] slash obligation
[00:22:55.000] as like a young Asian woman
[00:22:57.000] to be like super happy and bubbly
[00:22:59.000] and like oh yeah of course I don't mind
[00:23:01.000] I will take on that obligation
[00:23:03.000] but now that I'm in my late 20s
[00:23:05.000] I'm like what the fuck
[00:23:07.000] like execs don't always smile during meetings
[00:23:09.000] like why am I
[00:23:11.000] as a junior level employee who is
[00:23:13.000] getting all these obligations handed to me
[00:23:15.000] like why do I always have to be the one smiling
[00:23:17.000] and taking all these things with a smile
[00:23:19.000] because at the end of the day
[00:23:21.000] I may like 80% of the time
[00:23:23.000] like have to take these things
[00:23:25.000] but that doesn't mean I have to always be like
[00:23:27.000] grinning ear to ear
[00:23:29.000] which doesn't feel authentic
[00:23:31.000] and it just makes me hate myself
[00:23:33.000] like after the call is over
[00:23:35.000] so recently in a meeting
[00:23:37.000] I was just talking to someone
[00:23:39.000] and they were like oh like do you mind doing this
[00:23:41.000] I didn't smile
[00:23:43.000] I was just like yeah sure I can do that
[00:23:45.000] and with a straight face
[00:23:47.000] and it low key like changed my life
[00:23:49.000] did it make the other person go like
[00:23:51.000] oh actually never mind I'll do it
[00:23:53.000] no so they were just like
[00:23:55.000] oh are you sure you're like okay doing it
[00:23:57.000] oh
[00:23:59.000] and then I was like
[00:24:01.000] yeah I can do it
[00:24:03.000] I didn't want to come off like I was giving them attitude
[00:24:05.000] or like sass
[00:24:07.000] but that doesn't mean I have to be like
[00:24:09.000] I'm on this task you know
[00:24:11.000] so then I was like in some way
[00:24:13.000] I am expressing myself
[00:24:15.000] and the thing is
[00:24:17.000] at the end of the day there's a ton of people who don't smile
[00:24:19.000] all the time during meetings
[00:24:21.000] actually that's probably like the majority of your co-curs
[00:24:23.000] so I was like I'm just being normal now
[00:24:25.000] yeah and shedding like my mask
[00:24:27.000] ooh
[00:24:29.000] so it felt very freeing to be like
[00:24:31.000] sure I'll do it I guess
[00:24:33.000] with an eye roll
[00:24:35.000] no just kidding
[00:24:37.000] it was cathartic and I was like
[00:24:39.000] is this how other people
[00:24:41.000] what other people are like during meetings
[00:24:43.000] they don't always pretend like they're like giga happy all the time
[00:24:45.000] like I was like this
[00:24:47.000] can be me I'm not
[00:24:49.000] masking my emotions dude I can't wait
[00:24:51.000] till you show annoyance in meetings
[00:24:53.000] you can be like
[00:24:55.000] um yeah I guess
[00:24:57.000] I could do this but let's rethink this
[00:24:59.000] like is this something we actually need
[00:25:01.000] then everyone will be like oh
[00:25:03.000] shes right do we actually
[00:25:05.000] need to make her do this
[00:25:07.000] I think I've done that before
[00:25:09.000] but it hasn't been very controlled
[00:25:11.000] like I feel like if I'm pushed to that point
[00:25:13.000] I'm like really pushed there
[00:25:15.000] but I feel like you can do that without being emotional
[00:25:17.000] you know so I'm like definitely working up
[00:25:19.000] to that and again
[00:25:21.000] I feel like this is a huge realization
[00:25:23.000] for me but for many people
[00:25:25.000] this is just how they've approached work their whole life
[00:25:27.000] no I think I'm
[00:25:29.000] similar I always try to like smile
[00:25:31.000] and not that's like the mantra
[00:25:33.000] going through my head during meetings
[00:25:35.000] smile and nod you know
[00:25:37.000] say something positive if you can
[00:25:39.000] like insert yourself in here or whatever
[00:25:41.000] you're right I think part of it is
[00:25:43.000] drilled in from when we were younger
[00:25:45.000] like new to the workforce
[00:25:47.000] and we're like oh we need to show everyone
[00:25:49.000] we're happy to be here and like excited to do work
[00:25:51.000] but now it's like okay
[00:25:53.000] actually everyone else is just as jaded
[00:25:55.000] as we are if not more
[00:25:57.000] because a lot of my coworkers are older than me
[00:25:59.000] so like
[00:26:01.000] very normal to them probably
[00:26:03.000] yeah exactly
[00:26:05.000] and I feel like there's been
[00:26:07.000] a ton of meetings where
[00:26:09.000] I'm like talking to someone and I'm like
[00:26:11.000] super happy
[00:26:13.000] presenting on the outside
[00:26:15.000] and the other person doesn't match my energy
[00:26:17.000] and I feel like in the past I was kind of like
[00:26:19.000] what the hell
[00:26:21.000] I'm being so polite and this person is not
[00:26:23.000] but then I was kind of like well this person isn't forcing me
[00:26:25.000] to be super polite
[00:26:27.000] and like super happy and like smiley smiley
[00:26:29.000] it's just like what I feel like I should be doing in meetings
[00:26:31.000] honestly it's not a sin to like
[00:26:33.000] match someone else's energy as long as
[00:26:35.000] I'm not being rude or impolite
[00:26:37.000] so maybe in some ways
[00:26:39.000] it's almost like a power move to not
[00:26:41.000] smile during meetings
[00:26:43.000] or at least not feel obligated to smile
[00:26:45.000] yeah like keep them guessing
[00:26:47.000] I don't know what your emotion is
[00:26:49.000] yeah true
[00:26:51.000] dude but this kind of ties in
[00:26:53.000] with what I was saying earlier
[00:26:55.000] when you said no one's forcing
[00:26:57.000] you to be all smiley smiley
[00:26:59.000] it's like how I said like
[00:27:01.000] we have to be doing things that we want to do
[00:27:03.000] so
[00:27:05.000] you should be smiley smiley if you want to
[00:27:07.000] but like if you don't want to fuck it right
[00:27:09.000] yeah
[00:27:11.000] and I was actually talking to my friend recently
[00:27:13.000] and she was like
[00:27:15.000] if someone is somewhat rude
[00:27:17.000] or like maybe disagreeable in a meeting
[00:27:19.000] the craziest thing that you could do
[00:27:21.000] is like smile
[00:27:23.000] like have a huge smile on your face
[00:27:25.000] like flex the smile
[00:27:27.000] and I was like wow I never thought of
[00:27:29.000] smiling as something that's like empowering
[00:27:31.000] so I feel like if it is empowering to you
[00:27:33.000] then it totally is a power move
[00:27:35.000] but if it's something that's forced on you
[00:27:37.000] then you don't have to take it
[00:27:39.000] so it feels nice to have options
[00:27:41.000] wow now everything's just a power move
[00:27:43.000] I think I need more power in my life
[00:27:45.000] yeah
[00:27:47.000] I'm gonna think about
[00:27:49.000] my power moves next time
[00:27:51.000] in my meetings should I smile
[00:27:53.000] or should I straight face
[00:27:55.000] okay low key but sometimes if it's like a giant meeting
[00:27:57.000] or like a larger meeting
[00:27:59.000] that I'm not too invested in
[00:28:01.000] I just start like doing work
[00:28:03.000] you know like and I'm probably
[00:28:05.000] just like blank faced
[00:28:07.000] as I'm like doing work
[00:28:09.000] and on the camera
[00:28:11.000] that's the true power move when you're not even listening to me
[00:28:13.000] you're right
[00:28:15.000] you're right
[00:28:17.000] I've also had a small realization
[00:28:19.000] kind of similar to how
[00:28:21.000] like something so simple as
[00:28:23.000] taking control of your emotions in a meeting
[00:28:25.000] can be
[00:28:27.000] mine is that maybe the sun is
[00:28:29.000] like nice to see
[00:28:31.000] maybe it is
[00:28:33.000] useful for us
[00:28:35.000] maybe the sun does bring
[00:28:37.000] joy
[00:28:39.000] because earlier this week
[00:28:41.000] it was really sunny and nice
[00:28:43.000] and I was driving
[00:28:45.000] somewhere I forget where
[00:28:47.000] and I was just like wow
[00:28:49.000] it is such a beautiful
[00:28:51.000] day today like anything is
[00:28:53.000] possible and I drove home and I was like
[00:28:55.000] okay I'm gonna do whatever I want now
[00:28:59.000] dude actually that's so true
[00:29:01.000] and I think it's almost always
[00:29:03.000] April of every year
[00:29:05.000] where I have this realization and I'm like
[00:29:07.000] wait I don't hate my life
[00:29:09.000] but for some reason every winter I'm like
[00:29:11.000] still just as shocked at my
[00:29:13.000] seasonal depression dude right like
[00:29:15.000] when we did that episode
[00:29:17.000] in January where we were
[00:29:19.000] similarly talking about our life updates
[00:29:21.000] and like what was going on
[00:29:23.000] and I was like wow I'm like
[00:29:25.000] kind of bummed lately you know
[00:29:27.000] I can't do anything
[00:29:29.000] I feel like no will to
[00:29:31.000] do anything and now I'm like
[00:29:33.000] oh my god the sun is out even though I'm gonna be staying inside all day
[00:29:35.000] I feel like I can do anything
[00:29:37.000] oh my god
[00:29:39.000] I love that though
[00:29:41.000] there's something about the sun setting
[00:29:43.000] at 8, 8.30
[00:29:45.000] and like stepping out at like 7.30
[00:29:47.000] and not seeing utter darkness like I just feel so good
[00:29:49.000] yes I
[00:29:51.000] agree the other day
[00:29:53.000] I was literally eating dinner with my family
[00:29:55.000] with the sun like shining through
[00:29:57.000] the windows and I was like oh my god
[00:29:59.000] what is this
[00:30:01.000] feeling
[00:30:03.000] I know and I've been like feeling the urge
[00:30:05.000] when we go out to eat I'm like should we sit outside
[00:30:07.000] whoa who am I
[00:30:09.000] winter me could never
[00:30:11.000] seriously
[00:30:13.000] but then it rained yesterday
[00:30:15.000] really hard and I was like
[00:30:17.000] that's weird
[00:30:19.000] I know nature is making sure we're not too happy
[00:30:21.000] summer us is a different beast
[00:30:25.000] seriously and it's
[00:30:27.000] it's so funny because I feel like
[00:30:29.000] we're both a little more indoorsy people
[00:30:31.000] but
[00:30:33.000] like despite that the sun still brings
[00:30:35.000] so much joy
[00:30:37.000] I've been like opening the windows
[00:30:39.000] and stuff during the day
[00:30:41.000] because it's not super cold outside anymore
[00:30:43.000] and it just feels so nice
[00:30:45.000] yeah maybe seasonal depression
[00:30:47.000] is real
[00:30:49.000] they weren't lying
[00:30:51.000] I never
[00:30:53.000] thought about it that much before
[00:30:55.000] but now after that
[00:30:57.000] eye-opening moment I was like dude
[00:30:59.000] maybe what people say is true
[00:31:01.000] I wonder if next winter
[00:31:03.000] I'll remember this conversation
[00:31:05.000] and set less lofty goals for myself
[00:31:07.000] in Q1 because I feel like I'm always
[00:31:09.000] like oh my god I'm gonna do all these things in the new year
[00:31:11.000] and then because
[00:31:13.000] it's winter I'm like never mind
[00:31:15.000] I'm not gonna do shit
[00:31:17.000] but I always have that
[00:31:19.000] gap in the expectations for this
[00:31:21.000] reality so maybe this time I'll learn
[00:31:23.000] you know also maybe we should
[00:31:25.000] get each other like those
[00:31:27.000] happiness sunlight lamps
[00:31:29.000] ooh genius
[00:31:31.000] the ones that like
[00:31:33.000] pretend like it's sunlight
[00:31:35.000] but I always wonder like how do those
[00:31:37.000] work are they any different from
[00:31:39.000] just a regular light
[00:31:41.000] I don't know but I just feel like
[00:31:43.000] my brain will know that it's not sunlight
[00:31:45.000] like I know you're fake
[00:31:47.000] over there in the corner
[00:31:49.000] exactly
[00:31:51.000] low-key though
[00:31:53.000] do you feel like the sunlight
[00:31:55.000] hit that much more because you were traveling
[00:31:57.000] in like the rainiest city
[00:31:59.000] in the world
[00:32:01.000] honestly maybe
[00:32:03.000] so far listeners I did
[00:32:05.000] just travel to like London
[00:32:07.000] which is
[00:32:09.000] I don't know basically the Seattle of Europe
[00:32:11.000] right like always gloomy
[00:32:13.000] like lots of rain
[00:32:15.000] luckily when I was there it didn't rain that much
[00:32:17.000] but it was like cloudy
[00:32:19.000] the whole time so it's like relatively
[00:32:21.000] gloomy and I guess I didn't think too much
[00:32:23.000] about it because
[00:32:25.000] it's like oh I'm on vacation like it's fun
[00:32:27.000] but then you're right coming
[00:32:29.000] back I was definitely like oh my god
[00:32:31.000] this sun is so bright
[00:32:35.000] this is what happiness is
[00:32:37.000] you're like I belong in California
[00:32:39.000] but
[00:32:41.000] speaking of travel
[00:32:43.000] I have another update
[00:32:45.000] not necessarily a realization
[00:32:47.000] but an update
[00:32:49.000] which involves minimizing
[00:32:51.000] anxiety when traveling
[00:32:53.000] so last year I traveled
[00:32:55.000] to Japan on my own
[00:32:57.000] in the fall and it was
[00:32:59.000] really fun but I actually experienced
[00:33:01.000] a lot of anxiety
[00:33:03.000] during that trip there were definitely
[00:33:05.000] moments where I had to like
[00:33:07.000] stop and go to the bathroom
[00:33:09.000] to like breathe and regulate myself
[00:33:11.000] again and then be like okay
[00:33:13.000] I can like go back outside and like be okay
[00:33:15.000] I don't know I think like
[00:33:17.000] probably also just being by myself
[00:33:19.000] in a place where the main language
[00:33:21.000] is not English also you know
[00:33:23.000] contributed to all that
[00:33:25.000] I got some tips that like
[00:33:27.000] if you are prone to anxiety during traveling
[00:33:29.000] one thing you can do is
[00:33:31.000] bring something from home
[00:33:33.000] something familiar whether that is
[00:33:35.000] something that carries a scent from home
[00:33:37.000] or like something that you
[00:33:39.000] often interact with at home
[00:33:41.000] and it can kind of keep you
[00:33:43.000] grounded when you're traveling
[00:33:45.000] so I took that advice
[00:33:47.000] and I brought like a little
[00:33:49.000] plushie with me on my trip
[00:33:51.000] to be fair I was also traveling
[00:33:53.000] with someone this time so
[00:33:55.000] that like cuts out part of it
[00:33:57.000] and like I was in a country where the main language
[00:33:59.000] is English too so
[00:34:01.000] I think like overall everything factored in
[00:34:03.000] it was less of an anxiety
[00:34:05.000] inducing trip and
[00:34:07.000] I felt like I had won
[00:34:09.000] somehow because it was like okay
[00:34:11.000] like this time
[00:34:13.000] anxiety didn't catch me on my
[00:34:15.000] trip aww wait I'm so happy
[00:34:17.000] for you and it's nice to hear that the plushie trick
[00:34:19.000] worked yeah I
[00:34:21.000] totally feel you though I feel like traveling
[00:34:23.000] is something that's so fun
[00:34:25.000] a lot of people's top three hobbies
[00:34:27.000] and it's so glamorized but sometimes
[00:34:29.000] when you're actually on the trip
[00:34:31.000] I'm like damn all I want to do is like go home
[00:34:33.000] or at least like block out the world
[00:34:35.000] for 10 minutes while I collect myself
[00:34:37.000] especially because like
[00:34:39.000] a lot of the places that we end up
[00:34:41.000] traveling to are
[00:34:43.000] like high traffic areas right
[00:34:45.000] cause like of course everyone wants
[00:34:47.000] to travel there that's like part of the reason
[00:34:49.000] why you want to travel there too
[00:34:51.000] and so it's really easy
[00:34:53.000] to get like overstimulated
[00:34:55.000] or just be in a really like
[00:34:57.000] loud and like
[00:34:59.000] stimulating environment that we're not as used to
[00:35:01.000] dude especially considering
[00:35:03.000] we both live in the suburbs right now
[00:35:05.000] and we're so used to like
[00:35:07.000] silent exactly
[00:35:09.000] that is very true and
[00:35:11.000] I feel like low key part of it too
[00:35:13.000] is like
[00:35:15.000] no one loves tourists
[00:35:17.000] tourists bring in money, tourists
[00:35:19.000] bring in high traffic but
[00:35:21.000] at the end of the day like locals
[00:35:23.000] generally will judge tourists
[00:35:25.000] so that I'm already going into it
[00:35:27.000] being like okay yeah everyone fucking hates me
[00:35:31.000] shit I didn't even think about that
[00:35:35.000] I mean that's like the dramatic way of putting it
[00:35:37.000] but I think also like you don't know the
[00:35:39.000] customs there as well so that I'm
[00:35:41.000] always kind of constantly thinking like
[00:35:43.000] oh I hope I'm not doing anything wrong
[00:35:45.000] which I feel like is putting me on the defensive
[00:35:47.000] a little bit
[00:35:49.000] you're so right I have a similar thought
[00:35:51.000] I'm like I'm like
[00:35:53.000] damn everyone probably thinks I'm a dirty tourist
[00:35:55.000] or like a dirty foreigner
[00:35:57.000] out here
[00:35:59.000] true and we're American
[00:36:01.000] I feel like everyone hates Americans
[00:36:03.000] oh sorry you're Canadian
[00:36:05.000] oh yeah true
[00:36:07.000] but you're North American
[00:36:09.000] but also like being in London you know
[00:36:11.000] Canadian I'm part of the Commonwealth
[00:36:13.000] I was like wow
[00:36:15.000] yeah I was like wow it's like I'm home
[00:36:21.000] that's so funny
[00:36:23.000] I feel like one of the things that
[00:36:25.000] I have to do at least once or twice when I travel
[00:36:27.000] is I literally need
[00:36:29.000] like silence whether that comes in the form
[00:36:31.000] of being in my hotel room and taking a breather
[00:36:33.000] or literally
[00:36:35.000] putting on noise canceling headphones or something
[00:36:37.000] because otherwise I'm like okay I'm going to
[00:36:39.000] start to freak out like I needed to be absolutely silent
[00:36:41.000] yeah for sure
[00:36:43.000] I feel like as we get older
[00:36:45.000] and familiarize
[00:36:47.000] with our own like comforts of traveling
[00:36:49.000] I've really realized that
[00:36:51.000] going back to the hotel
[00:36:53.000] and you know taking a break in between
[00:36:55.000] things is so important for me
[00:36:57.000] like we don't really have to
[00:36:59.000] do everything back to back to back to back
[00:37:01.000] and I think me personally doing that
[00:37:03.000] kind of overwhelms me sometimes
[00:37:05.000] so you know there's nothing wrong with
[00:37:07.000] just heading back taking a breather
[00:37:09.000] or like sitting somewhere
[00:37:11.000] I always am reminded of that one time
[00:37:13.000] we traveled together to like Japan
[00:37:15.000] and Korea and one day
[00:37:17.000] we were just really tired
[00:37:19.000] we sat in a McDonald's for like three hours
[00:37:21.000] I was literally just thinking about that
[00:37:23.000] oh my god
[00:37:25.000] our mind wandered the same way
[00:37:27.000] but I feel like that's exactly what it is
[00:37:29.000] when I travel I feel so much pressure
[00:37:31.000] of like oh I only have X number of days here
[00:37:33.000] I need to explore everything do everything
[00:37:35.000] but I feel like my body
[00:37:37.000] and my anxiety is like please
[00:37:39.000] stop like please
[00:37:41.000] anything just to break please
[00:37:43.000] then maybe that's why
[00:37:45.000] I'm also drawn to places like that McDonald's
[00:37:47.000] in Japan where it's like oh this kind of
[00:37:49.000] feels like home and it's like somewhat
[00:37:51.000] familiar and it was like
[00:37:53.000] we went to the top floor where it was like nice
[00:37:55.000] and quiet too
[00:37:57.000] and the four of us are sat there
[00:37:59.000] looking for like an hour
[00:38:01.000] and it has a bathroom there
[00:38:03.000] everything we needed
[00:38:05.000] I also realized that
[00:38:07.000] I really need to get back on my
[00:38:09.000] fitness goals because traveling
[00:38:11.000] is a lot of walking and a lot of
[00:38:13.000] fitness to be honest so I was like wow
[00:38:15.000] I'm getting really tired every day
[00:38:17.000] I need to go home and get back on my
[00:38:19.000] fitness goals
[00:38:21.000] I know what you mean
[00:38:23.000] and I feel like there's a specific type of
[00:38:25.000] physical activity in traveling
[00:38:27.000] which is like walking
[00:38:29.000] and my friends always make fun of me for
[00:38:31.000] hating walking because even in New York
[00:38:33.000] I'll be like can we Uber?
[00:38:35.000] but traveling I'm always like okay
[00:38:37.000] I need to walk more at home
[00:38:39.000] I feel like I run and then I sit
[00:38:41.000] and I'm like yeah I was like I need more
[00:38:43.000] stamina like I'm getting old
[00:38:45.000] man dude tell me about it
[00:38:47.000] I feel like we've come to a lot
[00:38:49.000] of realizations and it's only
[00:38:51.000] like Q1 of this year
[00:38:53.000] as you mentioned in the beginning
[00:38:55.000] of the episode and we talked
[00:38:57.000] about like a whole bunch of crises
[00:38:59.000] and a whole bunch of like little small
[00:39:01.000] life realizations slash updates
[00:39:03.000] so you know part
[00:39:05.000] of me is excited because it's like oh
[00:39:07.000] if you know we did so much
[00:39:09.000] self reflection and learnings
[00:39:11.000] in just one quarter
[00:39:13.000] there's probably a lot more to come
[00:39:15.000] in the next three quarters of the year
[00:39:17.000] but also I'm kind of like oh shoot
[00:39:19.000] but that's probably tied to a bunch more crises
[00:39:21.000] I know I'm like
[00:39:23.000] that was only Q1
[00:39:25.000] what the fuck
[00:39:27.000] I'm also very curious to know
[00:39:29.000] if these quarter life crises
[00:39:31.000] slash meltdowns are normal
[00:39:33.000] so I would love for any listeners
[00:39:35.000] out there who are nodding along
[00:39:37.000] to this episode to message us
[00:39:39.000] or email us and be like yeah

[00:39:43.000] alone out here like what's wrong with me
[00:39:45.000] it's just us melting down
[00:39:47.000] every other week like
