[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Crystal.
[00:00:03.360] And I'm Jeesoo.
[00:00:15.000] I have a slang word for us to talk about today.
[00:00:18.060] And I think it's an interesting one to discuss, mainly just because it's truly a testament of slang evolving with us because of the world that we live in.
[00:00:30.540] It'll make sense when I explain it further.
[00:00:33.700] But I feel like we all kind of know the phrase caught red-handed.
[00:00:37.760] And so this slang phrase is the evolution of that.
[00:00:42.700] So the evolved version is now caught in 4K.
[00:00:46.660] And it truly kind of shows because there's just so much like video content, streamers, you know, things that get uploaded to YouTube or whatever.
[00:00:57.940] And so whenever people do something like stupid or silly, the easy comment is to be like, wow, I can't believe we just caught this on 4K.
[00:01:06.260] There's a bunch of variations of it, too.
[00:01:08.560] I think you mentioned biting the curb in 4K.
[00:01:11.360] So it's all along the similar lines of catching someone doing something silly or stupid, quote unquote, in 4K.
[00:01:19.540] I guess it's supposed to kind of emulate like a Google search where you might be looking for a video, but in super high definition.
[00:01:27.360] So if I were looking for a music video, I might type in so-and-so's music video in 4K or something.
[00:01:34.020] So I think biting the curb in 4K is actually like a form of a hate comment where you would put a celebrity's name that you hate before biting the curb in 4K.
[00:01:44.260] So, for example, I could be like Logan Paul biting the curb in 4K as a comment under a video where Logan Paul is doing something stupid.
[00:01:51.500] Yeah, it kind of reminds me of that subreddit livestream fail.
[00:01:55.980] It's just like clips of streamers when they like end up doing something stupid online and getting clipped or if they like accidentally leak something.
[00:02:05.320] Sometimes it's even wholesome stuff.
[00:02:07.040] But yeah, I think a lot of times the comments just end up being an echo chamber of like, oh, caught in 4K or like biting the curb or like whatever.
[00:02:14.980] Yeah, failing in 4K basically, which is just crazy, actually, because I'm sure most people are familiar with the phrase biting the curb or curb stomping.
[00:02:25.580] But it's a very violent thing to describe for anyone who doesn't know is essentially just imagine someone biting the curb and then bad things happening to that person while they're in that position, I guess.
[00:02:39.540] I don't want to get too gruesome on this.
[00:02:41.320] But yeah, it's like sort of a crazy hate comment to leave.
[00:02:43.900] I feel like back then our hate comments were like kind of more innocent and like wholesome.
[00:02:48.400] Yeah, hate comments are pretty crazy online now.
[00:02:52.740] Right.
[00:02:53.400] But is the next evolution of this going to be like Logan Paul biting the curb in VR?
[00:02:59.400] Dude, oh my god.
[00:03:01.280] Like that would be so funny.
[00:03:03.280] In 60.
[00:03:04.940] Yeah.
[00:03:06.100] Honestly, probably.
[00:03:08.000] Wait, I could totally see it being like in 3D.
[00:03:11.040] Yeah, 3D or VR.
[00:03:12.480] Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:13.900] In the metaverse.
[00:03:15.540] Yeah.
[00:03:16.540] All right.
[00:03:17.520] Well, slang words aside, our topic today is just about feeling like an adult and talking about our general adulting lives.
[00:03:28.560] It's been a few years as adults, I want to say.
[00:03:31.820] And like hopefully we have a better grasp on some things, but evidently not all things.
[00:03:37.540] Kind of in the beginning of the year or maybe it was like the end of last year, I mentioned how sometimes things still make me feel really young or like a kid.
[00:03:47.440] So we thought now we could reflect on if that has changed and if there are more things now that make us feel like adults.
[00:03:56.820] Yeah, I feel like often on this podcast, we're constantly having a crisis about not feeling our age.
[00:04:03.800] Yeah.
[00:04:04.160] And being in your late 20s, we are kind of like seasoned adults now.
[00:04:07.000] Mm-hmm.
[00:04:07.860] And recently I did have a moment where I felt very adult, which is eating fruit.
[00:04:14.520] I think a big part of Asian culture, you grow up eating a lot of fruit anyways.
[00:04:18.580] Mm-hmm.
[00:04:18.820] I feel like a lot of Asian parents love fruit, so then inevitably it kind of trickles down to you and your preferences.
[00:04:25.060] But it had been a few years since I've lived with my parents, so I wasn't really getting my fruit intake on the daily basis.
[00:04:31.200] And if anyone knows me in real life, you know I'm like a huge candy person.
[00:04:35.580] So I feel like all this time, starting college, my fruit substitute was candy.
[00:04:42.580] Mm-hmm.
[00:04:43.660] But a couple times this year, I've had some fruit experiences where I was like, holy shit, is fruit better than candy?
[00:04:50.620] And no one told me this entire time.
[00:04:53.960] Dude, fruit is just the adult version of candy.
[00:04:56.520] No, it literally is.
[00:04:57.940] And I had this mango the other day that was so expensive.
[00:05:02.840] I think it was like $7 or something from this one tiny market at a mall nearby us.
[00:05:09.060] When I was buying it, I was like, damn, I really like mangoes, but this is really expensive.
[00:05:12.760] But maybe it's expensive because it's good.
[00:05:14.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:05:15.080] And then I ate it and I literally, it like blew my mind.
[00:05:18.180] Oh, my God.
[00:05:18.240] Like my eyes were rolling back into my head.
[00:05:20.320] I was just like so impressed by this fruit.
[00:05:25.020] And then since then, I feel like I've just been craving candy significantly less.
[00:05:29.000] Oh, wow.
[00:05:29.900] That's so good.
[00:05:31.760] Dude, that just reminds me though.
[00:05:33.480] Do you ever watch Bretman Rock on TikTok?
[00:05:35.640] Oh, my God.
[00:05:36.160] Yes.
[00:05:36.400] When he eats his fruit, oh, my God.
[00:05:39.440] I'm like, that is the life I want to be living.
[00:05:41.600] Just picking the ripest, freshest fruit just out of his backyard.
[00:05:45.880] He's growing it himself.
[00:05:47.260] And it looks so good when he eats it.
[00:05:49.600] That's what I'm imagining happened to you when you ate that mango.
[00:05:53.960] Yeah, pretty much.
[00:05:55.140] I got some pretty good ROI from my $7 mango.
[00:05:59.380] Yeah.
[00:06:00.740] Yeah.
[00:06:01.160] Was it like one of the greenish reddish ones or was it like a yellow golden one?
[00:06:06.720] It was greenish reddish.
[00:06:08.620] But what was interesting about this one and what made me buy it even despite the price tag
[00:06:12.600] was it said it was fiberless.
[00:06:14.460] Oh.
[00:06:14.780] And it was also imported from I can't remember which country, but somewhere definitely more
[00:06:19.340] tropical than California.
[00:06:21.400] And I love mangoes, but I do dislike the fibers a little bit.
[00:06:25.460] I feel like sometimes it takes away from the experience.
[00:06:27.220] So I was so curious when I bought it and it did, in fact, have less fibers.
[00:06:31.620] Oh, my God.
[00:06:31.960] And it was very sweet.
[00:06:32.860] Then was it like creamy?
[00:06:34.920] Like what was the texture then?
[00:06:36.960] Yeah, it was creamy, really, really juicy.
[00:06:40.380] And it kind of just tasted like I was eating custard almost, but not quite as like gelatinous.
[00:06:47.680] Right.
[00:06:47.940] Just like such a smooth eating experience.
[00:06:51.600] Wait, that sounds so good.
[00:06:53.440] Yeah, dude.
[00:06:54.520] I mean, if it's good enough to convert me out of my candy addiction, I feel like it was pretty
[00:06:58.940] fucking good.
[00:07:00.180] I have also heard that if you want usually more high quality fruits and veggies,
[00:07:06.360] it's definitely worth it to check out your local farmer's market.
[00:07:10.400] Usually they'll have maybe even some produce that isn't even sold in stores, a variety of
[00:07:16.280] certain vegetables or fruits.
[00:07:18.280] So I feel like that's kind of a goal of mine right now.
[00:07:21.340] And I feel like that's also a very like adulty thing to do.
[00:07:25.220] Oh, my God.
[00:07:25.880] It totally is going to the farmer's market with like a basket in your arms or something.
[00:07:32.140] Exactly.
[00:07:32.680] And also because farmer's markets usually happen earlier, right?
[00:07:37.180] Like in the mornings.
[00:07:38.420] Right.
[00:07:38.860] And you especially want to go early to get there before everything sells out.
[00:07:42.940] And I'm not a huge morning person.
[00:07:44.840] So, you know, I'm like, damn, if I were to wake up specifically just to go to a farmer's
[00:07:49.840] market, that is true adulting.
[00:07:52.240] You're like, this is why this is still a goal.
[00:07:54.380] Yeah.
[00:07:56.020] But honestly, yeah.
[00:07:57.420] Waking up early to do something that's not hedonistic is so adult, I feel, because going
[00:08:03.260] to a farmer's market is not an obligation necessarily.
[00:08:06.480] And it's not just pure pleasure.
[00:08:08.860] You know, it's just like something that's kind of cool and like benefits you.
[00:08:12.640] So I feel like every time I've woken up early and like gone to the gym or even something like
[00:08:17.200] go to golf, I'm always just like, wow, I'm an adult.
[00:08:20.160] Like I'm waking up early for something that's not work or like a social obligation.
[00:08:24.340] So true.
[00:08:25.120] I don't know why, but I guess sleeping in just feels like a thing for younger people and waking
[00:08:32.240] up early.
[00:08:32.900] I don't know.
[00:08:33.720] It almost feels like a mature thing to do.
[00:08:37.240] But honestly, I feel like it is.
[00:08:40.080] This past week, my husband and I had had kind of busier work schedules a little bit.
[00:08:45.680] So we've been trying to go to bed by 10.
[00:08:49.620] Wow.
[00:08:50.160] And every time I lay there and it's like you go into bed by 10, watch some stuff.
[00:08:54.520] And then by 1030, you're like starting to put your phone away.
[00:08:56.820] I'm always like, wow, I'm like 80 years old.
[00:09:02.740] Oh, my God.
[00:09:04.280] Dude, I could never.
[00:09:08.380] I just like I can't.
[00:09:10.400] Waking up is just mostly only for responsibilities work or.
[00:09:15.320] Okay.
[00:09:15.960] I will say I sometimes wake up early for like golf or something of that sort.
[00:09:20.780] But still, it just feels like such an adult thing to do.
[00:09:24.020] It's like, oh, I have responsibility and that's why I'm waking up early.
[00:09:27.540] Or maybe it's even like I chose to have responsibility and that's why I'm waking up early.
[00:09:31.940] And maybe that's the real adult part about it.
[00:09:34.880] That you like choose to have a certain responsibility that you're following through with.
[00:09:39.460] Damn.
[00:09:40.220] Yeah.
[00:09:40.420] It's like doing stuff not just because you want to do it, but because you should.
[00:09:45.000] Yeah.
[00:09:45.600] And speaking of, I think when I plan my weekend sometimes and it's just like a bunch of errands,
[00:09:51.040] that also makes me feel kind of adulty.
[00:09:53.620] Ooh.
[00:09:54.140] Wait, can I tell you a moment where I felt like you were such an adult?
[00:09:58.020] Oh, my God.
[00:09:58.580] Okay.
[00:09:59.640] It must have been a couple of weeks ago, but some of our friends came over to your place
[00:10:04.680] to binge watch the Twilight movies.
[00:10:06.500] Yeah.
[00:10:07.600] I think when we came in, you had like some sort of contraption in your hands.
[00:10:11.880] And I was like, oh, what are you holding?
[00:10:14.320] And you were like, oh, just I just need to like weatherproof the door or something like that.
[00:10:18.520] And I was like, oh, holy shit.
[00:10:20.560] I've never even heard that phrase ever in my entire life.
[00:10:23.640] And I just thought you were such an adult in that moment.
[00:10:26.800] Oh, my God.
[00:10:27.760] Wait, I don't even remember that.
[00:10:30.460] Oh, my God.
[00:10:31.260] That's so funny.
[00:10:32.200] That sounds like me, I think.
[00:10:34.020] I really like doing home projects, I guess.
[00:10:37.600] So it's a little different right now because I'm like renting.
[00:10:40.600] I can't go crazy.
[00:10:42.380] But like if I could, I would do so much.
[00:10:45.920] You're right.
[00:10:46.700] That does feel very responsible and just like things that we would have never thought about
[00:10:52.560] when we were younger.
[00:10:53.940] Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:54.980] I was shook because I feel like when you're young, the chores, you know, are like sweeping,
[00:10:59.800] like raking leaves, wiping surfaces, like very elementary, fundamental things or like ways
[00:11:06.900] to clean it up, keep the house.
[00:11:08.460] I feel like the older we get, it's like you see more things that need to be done around
[00:11:12.720] the home.
[00:11:13.460] So to me, the fact that you even knew what weather stripping was just like opened up
[00:11:17.860] a new world for me.
[00:11:18.820] And I was like, oh, I also need to do that.
[00:11:24.280] Thank you for putting a term to the thing that I felt like we needed to do.
[00:11:29.480] Although I will admit, I think owning your own space, you know, whether it's a rental
[00:11:34.320] or truly owning it or whatever, but like having ownership of your own space does feel much
[00:11:41.540] more filled with responsibility or just adulty.
[00:11:45.780] How many times will we say adult this episode?
[00:11:49.580] But I think it's different because like when you're with a platonic roommate, it's much
[00:11:54.860] more almost college feeling.
[00:11:57.060] You still feel pretty young.
[00:11:58.860] You know, you have to share space.
[00:12:00.560] So it doesn't quite feel like it's hard to describe, but it just doesn't feel to the
[00:12:05.980] level of like you get to take control of this entire space.
[00:12:10.760] Hmm.
[00:12:11.760] And I think you're right about like the sense of ownership that comes with it being purely
[00:12:15.720] like your space.
[00:12:17.400] An easy example that comes to mind is I feel like when I was younger, I would be like, oh,
[00:12:21.720] we should throw a party.
[00:12:22.760] Like it would be so much fun.
[00:12:24.400] And I would just think about the fun part.
[00:12:26.720] But the older I get, the space aspect is more important, you know?
[00:12:30.100] So then now if I'm thinking about throwing a party, I'm like, damn, that's a lot of cleanup.
[00:12:33.800] That's a lot of prep.
[00:12:34.760] Like that's like all this work that comes with it instead of just thinking about the joy that
[00:12:39.480] comes out of it.
[00:12:40.660] Ooh, so true.
[00:12:41.980] I think back in, you know, college or even before that, inviting people over, it's like
[00:12:48.440] not really your place.
[00:12:50.560] If it's your parents' place, you're not really cleaning it up.
[00:12:54.040] If anything, your parents end up cleaning it up and you don't even realize.
[00:12:58.240] Or like in college, you just invite people over and you don't think too much about it
[00:13:01.840] because it's like, oh, well, everyone's dorm looks about the same.
[00:13:05.000] But now it's like, oh my God, I want to like, you know, have everyone be really comfortable
[00:13:09.880] when they're here or like leave a good impression.
[00:13:12.520] Impress people with my artwork, all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:16.540] With my floating shelves.
[00:13:18.120] Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:20.380] All my plants and like all my decor.
[00:13:24.800] I need them to see my whole personality just when they step through the door.
[00:13:30.460] Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:31.480] And I think that makes you put a lot more of your like heart and soul into cleaning or
[00:13:37.240] like decorating and whatnot.
[00:13:38.780] Instead of it feeling like just a space, it's like your place, right?
[00:13:43.800] It's like an extension of yourself.
[00:13:45.880] Yeah.
[00:13:47.220] I feel like I really feel it too when sometimes our conversations with our friends literally
[00:13:52.100] turn to like what kind of furniture we're looking for or what kind of furniture we like.
[00:13:57.380] And then in that moment, we're all just like, oh my God, this is really what we've become.
[00:14:01.460] We get so excited over furniture.
[00:14:04.560] Yeah, that's such a good point.
[00:14:06.180] Like conversation topics are really evolving, huh?
[00:14:09.100] I think it's going to start to feel really weird when maybe some of us have kids, some
[00:14:13.840] of us don't.
[00:14:15.160] But then like half of us are talking about like, oh, what preschool are you going to send your
[00:14:17.980] kid?
[00:14:18.540] Oh my God.
[00:14:19.000] And then the other half will maybe still be talking about the furniture aspect a little
[00:14:23.200] bit.
[00:14:23.760] Yeah.
[00:14:25.540] It was like that time we went on like a mini girls trip up to Napa at the first winery.
[00:14:30.880] We're just starting to settle in and drink a bit.
[00:14:33.860] And we're all like, so thoughts on freezing eggs?
[00:14:38.620] Oh my God, you're so right.
[00:14:41.540] We literally spent the entire time at that first winery talking about egg freezing.
[00:14:47.300] Oh God, it's in full force.
[00:14:50.440] We can't even stop it.
[00:14:52.600] But I mean, I think the benefit of this too, maybe now our brain is able to grasp bigger
[00:14:58.580] concepts and talk about these things that uses feel a lot more intimidating when we were
[00:15:03.880] younger, you know?
[00:15:04.960] Yeah.
[00:15:05.100] And it also means we have maybe some of the more financial means to be able to even consider
[00:15:09.260] something like egg freezing.
[00:15:10.520] So that's kind of cool.
[00:15:11.960] Yeah.
[00:15:12.320] And I guess it's just like kind of inevitable too, right?
[00:15:15.240] That we're like getting to the age that these things are happening around us.
[00:15:19.440] We're seeing it happen as well.
[00:15:21.400] So I'm glad we're able to have open discussions about it with each other.
[00:15:25.780] Yeah.
[00:15:26.180] Yeah.
[00:15:26.420] We're kind of experiencing the same age together.
[00:15:29.640] And that in itself is very special, even if we each experience it in a different way.
[00:15:34.360] Yeah.
[00:15:34.940] And we're not trying to shield ourselves or like hide from reality.
[00:15:38.380] We're just like, so this is kind of the reality that's coming up on us.
[00:15:42.020] Like, what are your thoughts?
[00:15:44.920] God.
[00:15:45.360] God.
[00:15:46.120] Although I will say that some of the other moments where I feel proud of my ability to
[00:15:52.820] be an adult is more simple and maybe like a little bit more lighthearted.
[00:15:57.640] I was kind of thinking about this recently, but every time I go up to the fish counter
[00:16:03.160] at like a grocery store and I ask for salmon to like the fish guy instead of buying like frozen
[00:16:09.240] salmon filet, I'm like, holy shit, this is late twenties.
[00:16:14.200] Oh my God.
[00:16:15.240] I actually had a similar experience recently where I was at, I think it was a 99 ranch
[00:16:20.380] or something.
[00:16:21.120] And I noticed that the stores, their own cut up ground pork was cheaper than the like
[00:16:27.120] pre-packaged one.
[00:16:28.640] And I had a moment where I was, I just stared at them for a second and I was like,
[00:16:32.800] no, I have to buy the cheaper one.
[00:16:34.880] So I forced myself to talk to the butcher guy and I was like, can I get a pound of this?
[00:16:42.780] I think they're always so nice too, but yeah, I have to like muster up all the courage inside
[00:16:47.000] me and be like, give me a pound of that.
[00:16:49.360] And dude, I had the same feeling as you.
[00:16:51.660] I was like, wow, this is like adulthood.
[00:16:53.860] This is like stuff my parents would not be afraid to do.
[00:16:57.000] I know.
[00:16:57.740] Oh, and I feel like the next step up is like, if you're buying steak or like fish, for example,
[00:17:05.240] if you're brave enough to be like, can I get that filet instead of that other one?
[00:17:09.500] Like that's true adulthood.
[00:17:14.100] What was also funny in the moment was I was fully ready to speak Chinese to this guy.
[00:17:20.040] I was like, oh shit, how do you say ground pork in Chinese?
[00:17:23.320] And then I was like, okay, worst case, I'll just point and be like that one in Chinese.
[00:17:27.560] One pound.
[00:17:28.340] But then the person who came up was fully not Chinese.
[00:17:33.760] You're like, oh, thank God.
[00:17:35.300] Can I get a pound of that?
[00:17:39.340] Oh man.
[00:17:40.840] The other crazy part of that too is I guess for something like steak or fish filets, you're
[00:17:48.400] not really asking for a pound of something.
[00:17:51.400] But for something like ground pork or maybe like bigger slabs of meat, you do kind of want
[00:17:55.420] to know how many pounds of something that you're getting, right?
[00:17:57.980] I feel like being able to visualize and like just visually understand what a pound of something
[00:18:05.100] looks like is also just crazy.
[00:18:07.800] Because sometimes I'll ask, they'll be like, how many pounds do you want?
[00:18:10.500] And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:18:11.560] Like how many should I get?
[00:18:12.820] Like you tell me.
[00:18:14.000] Yeah, I feel like that's harder with the filets because I think at least for the like ground
[00:18:19.700] meat, the prepackaged ones will say like, oh, this is, you know, half a pound or this is
[00:18:23.800] a pound.
[00:18:24.220] So I'm just like envisioning that.
[00:18:25.820] But for the filets, it's way harder.
[00:18:27.440] I'm like, okay, I don't know how much that cut looks like.
[00:18:30.540] It could be 0.3 pounds for all I know.
[00:18:33.940] It's like when you order steak at restaurants and it's like three ounce or like six ounce.
[00:18:39.140] I'm like, I literally have no idea what this is.
[00:18:42.060] They're like, thanks.
[00:18:43.100] This means nothing to me.
[00:18:45.180] They're like, would you like the three ounce or the six ounce?
[00:18:47.720] And I'm like, um, how much does a normal human eat?
[00:18:52.440] So literally, but I feel like parents are so good about that kind of stuff.
[00:18:55.760] Yeah.
[00:18:56.440] They can just look and instantly be like, yeah, that's like 12.4 ounces.
[00:19:00.860] I'm like, is your are your eyeballs calculators?
[00:19:04.060] And I'm like, dude, you didn't even grow up in the freaking imperial system.
[00:19:08.720] How do you know this?
[00:19:10.140] Even with the conversions, they're still better and faster than us.
[00:19:14.700] There was this one time where I was kind of confused because the weather.
[00:19:19.300] Okay.
[00:19:19.660] So in California, it very rarely ever goes below 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:19:24.800] Right.
[00:19:25.060] And so anything below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, I literally have no idea what that means.
[00:19:30.140] But in Celsius, I do understand it because I've experienced lower temps in Celsius.
[00:19:35.600] I was like, what does this even mean?
[00:19:37.260] Like, what is 40 degrees?
[00:19:38.520] And so I looked it up in Celsius and my dad was like, dude, are you stupid?
[00:19:41.640] And then he gave me the conversion equation.
[00:19:43.940] And I was like, you just have that off the top of your head.
[00:19:46.480] Like, ready?
[00:19:47.440] Like, what?
[00:19:49.120] Wait, I feel like I'm torn between being like, yeah, the Celsius Fahrenheit conversion equation is really easy.
[00:19:55.200] But also, like, I myself don't know it.
[00:19:57.340] So I can't clown you.
[00:19:59.520] It is not that difficult.
[00:20:01.740] But yeah, like, why would I just know it off the top of my head?
[00:20:06.160] Honestly, being able to Google stuff in like two seconds just at our fingertips has ruined my ability to retain any information.
[00:20:13.920] That's so true.
[00:20:14.920] And I have like a Google Home too.
[00:20:17.060] So sometimes I'll just ask it directly.
[00:20:19.180] I'll be like, what is this degrees in Celsius?
[00:20:22.600] No, I literally do that too with my Alexa.
[00:20:26.640] It's gotten to the point where I'll ask it when I wake up and I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:20:30.720] And then like 10 minutes later after my shower, I'm like, what temperature did they say I was going to be?
[00:20:36.500] Like, can you repeat that?
[00:20:37.980] Oh my God, dude, it's so bad.
[00:20:40.180] I recently went on a trip and it was maybe two or three days.
[00:20:44.860] Immediately, I was like, wow, I miss my Google Home.
[00:20:47.980] I had just the urge to ask like, hey, Google, so many times throughout the day.
[00:20:53.140] I was like, this might be a problem.
[00:20:57.460] We're slowly becoming our parents.
[00:20:59.560] Oh God.
[00:21:00.660] Okay.
[00:21:00.820] I thought of another example.
[00:21:02.600] This one is slightly less positive.
[00:21:04.440] But I feel like when I was younger, I was always buying shoes that were so cute, but uncomfortable.
[00:21:13.260] Comfort was not even in my like top three list of priorities.
[00:21:17.620] You know, I would just bear through the pain.
[00:21:20.140] I would buy really high heels for like formals and dances and stuff.
[00:21:24.440] And would just always wear these like toe pinching ballet flats and whatnot.
[00:21:29.160] But now that I'm older, I feel like comfort is one of the biggest things that I look for.
[00:21:34.160] And if I know I need to go on a trip and there's going to be a nice dinner, so I'll need to bring my nice shoes.
[00:21:39.800] If I know we're going to be like walking around and whatnot, like I will also pack my comfy, huge, like wide toed sneakers as well.
[00:21:48.440] I can relate.
[00:21:50.140] Comfort is big.
[00:21:51.420] You don't care as much about maybe quote unquote impressing the people around you.
[00:21:56.420] It's more just like I could make a home in one piece and like happily, right?
[00:22:00.940] Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:02.900] I know what blisters feel like, so I will choose to avoid them.
[00:22:08.840] Yeah, even like the thought of breaking in new shoes is annoying.
[00:22:13.820] I'm like, why can't they just be comfortable out of the box?
[00:22:16.660] I know.
[00:22:17.300] Like I remember one time I got these Doc Martens and I tried to break them in for like a year.
[00:22:22.520] And they would just refuse to break in.
[00:22:24.680] I don't know if it was like the model I got or maybe the size was off or something like that.
[00:22:27.960] But I still fucking wore them.
[00:22:29.620] And every time I wore them, I would just like bleed everywhere.
[00:22:32.480] But I was like, oh, my outfit, my fit looks good.
[00:22:37.460] And now I'm just like, what was wrong with me?
[00:22:40.780] I would never do that in this day and age.
[00:22:43.960] Oh my God.
[00:22:44.800] And I guess that also plays into the whole thing about, you know, trying to sleep early,
[00:22:49.880] getting the right amount of sleep, being healthier.
[00:22:52.860] I feel like that's all part of, you know, taking on the responsibility and recognizing
[00:22:58.500] the need to take care of yourself.
[00:23:00.880] Definitely.
[00:23:01.180] I mean, maybe it's just like we see more and experience more.
[00:23:06.340] We learn to not take things like health or like comfort for granted.
[00:23:10.900] On a lighter note, I thought of this because holiday season is coming up.
[00:23:16.360] But another thing that makes me feel pretty adult is for sure going to family friend parties,
[00:23:23.560] even if my parents aren't around, like if they're out of town or something.
[00:23:28.360] I don't know.
[00:23:29.080] I feel like I chat with adults a little bit at these parties.
[00:23:32.960] But, you know, back in the day, the separation between adult and kid was always so clear cut.
[00:23:40.480] It's almost like I'm forcing my way in like, hey guys, I'm an adult too now.
[00:23:47.300] Honestly, yeah, that is such a big one.
[00:23:49.700] It's like people who felt like giants to you are now not necessarily peers,
[00:23:55.060] but a little bit more on equal footing.
[00:23:57.580] Yeah.
[00:23:58.100] Recently, actually, you were also there.
[00:24:00.080] But recently I did like a big golf thing with my mom and like a bunch of her friends.
[00:24:07.180] And then afterwards we went out for dinner.
[00:24:09.020] We just all sat around the dinner table chatting about our day.
[00:24:12.500] Oh my God.
[00:24:13.180] And I was like, wait, I'm included?
[00:24:15.160] I can open my mouth and talk.
[00:24:17.660] Oh my God.
[00:24:18.460] It's like that time when one of our friends who is like good family friends with James,
[00:24:24.040] he told all of us, he was like, oh my God,
[00:24:26.340] Jisoo and James are out on a triple date with a few of our like family friend parents.
[00:24:31.220] Like after you guys got married.
[00:24:33.380] And I was like, damn, that is, that's adulting.
[00:24:38.420] You guys made it.
[00:24:41.320] Dude, the phrase triple date is so fucking crazy to describe that.
[00:24:46.680] Dude, but it was, wasn't it?
[00:24:48.860] It low-key was.
[00:24:49.960] After I saw that, I was like, wow, I can't even say anything because it's true.
[00:24:55.060] But honestly, maybe the barrier that we felt with our family friend parents and stuff when
[00:25:00.880] we were younger was not just the age, but the fact that we were like students and stuff.
[00:25:05.540] Because I feel like as soon as I entered the workforce, I was able to talk about work with
[00:25:10.160] parents.
[00:25:10.820] And even on the golf day that we did, James and I golfed with the dads.
[00:25:15.680] One of the dads has like a very similar professional background to James.
[00:25:19.800] They use like the same language in their coding and whatnot, just like work in very similar
[00:25:25.180] fields, even within engineering.
[00:25:27.260] Yeah.
[00:25:27.580] They like talked about it.
[00:25:28.900] Whoa.
[00:25:29.520] For like, I don't know, a good five minutes, every couple of holes or whatnot.
[00:25:33.400] And I was like, this is crazy.
[00:25:34.700] Like there's common ground to the point where there's professional common ground and you can
[00:25:39.060] talk about that kind of stuff.
[00:25:40.240] Wow.
[00:25:41.340] I think that's super reasonable because honestly, just thinking and reflecting at work, I talk
[00:25:48.760] to people who are probably around my parents' age quite often too.
[00:25:53.600] And it's like very normal because they don't know you as like some kid who grew up.
[00:25:59.860] They just know you as who you are right now.
[00:26:02.660] Right.
[00:26:02.960] And so that's honestly not so different from these family friends.
[00:26:06.780] They just have like more context about who you are, I guess.
[00:26:10.740] Yeah, that's very true.
[00:26:12.280] Like all these barriers are just being broken down every year.
[00:26:15.860] I don't know about your family friend group, but in mine, none of the kids are married yet.
[00:26:22.800] And I feel like that is another barrier that would be taken down, you know, once that step
[00:26:29.420] gets reached.
[00:26:29.980] I don't know if it's like just you and James who are married or if other people have started
[00:26:34.420] getting married too.
[00:26:35.740] That's a really good point.
[00:26:37.620] I mean, we're definitely not the only couple married within the family friends that we
[00:26:42.700] know and like see regularly.
[00:26:44.780] And also there is a couple who we see who has recently had a baby.
[00:26:50.780] Oh.
[00:26:51.600] So I'm really excited to see them hopefully this holiday season and just kind of like see
[00:26:55.360] how that dynamic changes.
[00:26:56.580] Because I feel like going from a single slash unmarried woman to a married woman is a big
[00:27:01.860] jump.
[00:27:02.400] And then also the jump from being a married woman to a mom is also a big jump.
[00:27:07.680] Yeah.
[00:27:08.200] So yeah, I will report back.
[00:27:10.020] Okay.
[00:27:10.460] I'm excited to hear.
[00:27:12.600] This also makes me wonder what if you just showed up to one of these family friend things
[00:27:18.260] and you tried to act really, I don't know, important in terms of like at work, maybe you're like,
[00:27:24.340] damn, it's been so busy.
[00:27:25.900] I'm managing all these people and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:29.560] I wonder if the parents would be like, whoa, they have like serious work going on.
[00:27:34.560] They suddenly just start respecting you more.
[00:27:38.680] I thought you were going to say the other way.
[00:27:40.980] They would be like, bro, I'm literally a VP at like this tech company.
[00:27:45.680] Like don't try to act like you're all busy.
[00:27:50.530] I mean, that is an interesting question though.
[00:27:52.590] It's like, what do kids do to gain the respect of like family friend parents?
[00:27:57.690] Yeah.
[00:27:58.110] Because I want to say that they might still think we're just really young in our careers.
[00:28:03.210] And I mean, to a certain point, that is also kind of true, but just because that is true
[00:28:09.990] doesn't mean that there isn't complexity or things that happen at work that would be very
[00:28:15.930] similar to what happens to them in their work.
[00:28:19.150] Yeah.
[00:28:19.730] I mean, I don't know if this is just my personal opinion.
[00:28:21.890] I am just only pulling from my experiences.
[00:28:25.250] Right.
[00:28:25.610] I feel like gender also has to do a little bit with this because I feel like maybe this is
[00:28:30.870] more of a male thing.
[00:28:32.150] Like I feel like when I talk to family friend moms, we don't talk about career or like work
[00:28:37.830] that extensively.
[00:28:38.990] But I feel like I've heard James have like really long in-depth conversations about what
[00:28:43.210] he does at work.
[00:28:44.190] I see.
[00:28:44.610] So I wonder if part of it is kind of gendered, at least in like Asian circles.
[00:28:49.150] Honestly, maybe.
[00:28:50.370] I think also the most I get sometimes because I'm also not in like engineering, right?
[00:28:57.290] So low key, no one truly knows what I do.
[00:29:01.290] Literally a month or two ago, my mom was like, wait, hold on.
[00:29:04.150] So what do you do, Crystal?
[00:29:07.870] Your mom?
[00:29:08.770] Yeah.
[00:29:09.090] Not even a family friend parent.
[00:29:11.230] And I was like, wait, mom, I feel like I've shown you my work before.
[00:29:16.430] She's like, I just need a refresher.
[00:29:17.990] Yeah.
[00:29:18.450] Yeah, pretty much.
[00:29:21.130] But I'll get like, oh, are you still working at whatever company?
[00:29:24.690] And I'm like, yeah.
[00:29:25.870] And then they're like, cool.
[00:29:26.930] Because to them, it's like, that's a good company.
[00:29:29.490] Like, that's all we really need to know.
[00:29:31.750] Sounds like you're doing great.
[00:29:33.570] Don't need to know the details.
[00:29:35.930] The checklist of how they like rate your career is so small.
[00:29:41.210] It's like, do I know the name?
[00:29:43.030] Yes.
[00:29:43.650] Yeah.
[00:29:43.890] And they're like, but I low key have no idea what she does.
[00:29:46.330] So we shouldn't ask any more questions.
[00:29:48.190] We shouldn't confuse ourselves further.
[00:29:50.970] Let's just leave it as it is.
[00:29:54.470] God, that's so funny.
[00:29:56.030] I'm also just imagining myself as like a future family friend parent.
[00:30:00.050] Just like trying to talk to people decades younger, being like, how's your job?
[00:30:10.630] Oh my God, that's so true.
[00:30:12.770] You're like, is like school still the same?
[00:30:18.950] Like, do you guys still learn this?
[00:30:21.330] Like, do you still read this book at school?
[00:30:24.550] Jokes aside, though, sometimes when I talk to my Gen Z co-workers,
[00:30:27.850] I do feel this way a little bit.
[00:30:29.950] It's like half feeling old and also half just being like,
[00:30:33.210] wow, this is reality now.
[00:30:34.690] I'm not the youngest person at my work anymore.
[00:30:36.750] Dude, I wish.
[00:30:39.730] I've still remained the youngest person at work.
[00:30:42.330] Dude, I think there's pros and cons, but maybe mostly pros.
[00:30:45.310] Like, that's a little cool.
[00:30:46.610] That's true.
[00:30:47.170] You're still like the hip person.
[00:30:48.490] It's definitely not terrible,
[00:30:49.890] but I just, I want to know what Gen Z is like in the workforce.
[00:30:54.850] I will say it's very interesting.
[00:30:56.290] I think it's really fascinating, actually,
[00:30:58.610] because maybe even up to our generation,
[00:31:02.030] work is like formal, you know?
[00:31:04.130] So like there's a side of you that you present at work,
[00:31:07.130] but it may not necessarily be what you are presenting to like your friends.
[00:31:11.930] Right.
[00:31:12.230] But I feel like for Gen Z,
[00:31:13.770] that gap is a little bit smaller and less pronounced.
[00:31:17.870] So there's definitely a sense of casualness
[00:31:20.590] and kind of friend vibes,
[00:31:22.430] less formality in the words or like phrases that they use
[00:31:25.410] and definitely less formality in like their outfits.
[00:31:27.910] And I kind of like it,
[00:31:29.210] but it's also like a little bit intimidating.
[00:31:31.490] Oh, really?
[00:31:32.250] Yeah.
[00:31:32.830] Oh my God.
[00:31:33.590] Okay.
[00:31:33.970] Low key though,
[00:31:34.990] maybe that is what I seem like to my coworkers.
[00:31:37.710] I feel like I go into work really casually.
[00:31:40.410] I'm a little quiet though.
[00:31:41.710] So I don't know about that part
[00:31:42.890] in terms of showing a lot of personality,
[00:31:44.950] but I do think I still give off the like casual, chill vibes.
[00:31:48.750] So they're probably just like,
[00:31:50.270] yeah, Crystal's just young.
[00:31:52.190] Damn.
[00:31:53.210] Maybe I should be more like that.
[00:31:55.150] Sometimes I wear,
[00:31:56.050] I mean,
[00:31:56.430] I think I wear like slightly more formal outfits in general,
[00:31:59.090] but there's this one cardigan that I have,
[00:32:02.770] which I feel like it's a cute cardigan,
[00:32:04.290] but I think I'm just styling it poorly.
[00:32:05.850] But every time I wear it,
[00:32:06.910] it's like a white cardigan,
[00:32:08.630] tweed jacket vibes,
[00:32:09.910] but not tweed.
[00:32:10.990] And every time I wear it and I look in the mirror,
[00:32:13.050] I feel like I'm doing like Hillary Clinton cosplay.
[00:32:18.510] I can envision it now that you've said that.
[00:32:23.420] And I just,
[00:32:25.040] I feel like my coworkers must think I'm like a billion years old.
[00:32:31.410] Oh my God.
[00:32:32.670] They're like,
[00:32:33.230] she gets married and these are the outfits she comes in now.
[00:32:36.950] Exactly.
[00:32:40.190] Yeah,
[00:32:40.910] I definitely go in pretty casually.
[00:32:42.510] And then I wonder sometimes like,
[00:32:44.270] oh,
[00:32:44.650] am I maybe too casual?
[00:32:46.230] Should I dress up a little bit?
[00:32:48.030] Match my coworkers vibes.
[00:32:50.030] But then I'm like,
[00:32:51.370] it's kind of like a lot of work.
[00:32:54.290] You think about it for like half a second.
[00:32:56.090] You're like,
[00:32:56.390] I'm good.
[00:32:57.870] Also,
[00:32:58.370] I think maybe if I tried too hard,
[00:33:00.090] they might be like,
[00:33:00.930] oh,
[00:33:01.570] that's not how Crystal usually dresses.
[00:33:03.410] Like she's usually very casual.
[00:33:04.890] Like,
[00:33:05.070] is there something going on?
[00:33:06.890] Why is she dressed up?
[00:33:08.690] Right,
[00:33:09.090] right.
[00:33:09.210] This is like the road I've paved.
[00:33:12.110] So I just must continue down on it.
[00:33:15.710] No,
[00:33:16.310] I dig that though.
[00:33:17.750] I feel like it's kind of a privilege to grow up in an era where we don't have to wear like a suit and tie to work every day.
[00:33:23.570] Yeah.
[00:33:23.930] So might as well take advantage of it.
[00:33:25.550] You know,
[00:33:26.130] I go into work in like t-shirts all the time.
[00:33:29.570] I mean,
[00:33:30.330] especially in ESSA,
[00:33:31.510] sometimes walking around during like commuting hours on the streets of San Francisco.
[00:33:35.490] I'm like,
[00:33:36.250] wow,
[00:33:37.150] people in New York would have like a fit,
[00:33:39.970] you know?
[00:33:40.730] True.
[00:33:41.350] Barney from how I met your mother would actually have like a heart attack.
[00:33:46.210] Okay.
[00:33:46.650] I will admit though,
[00:33:47.810] when I worked in SF,
[00:33:49.530] I would dress up a little more.
[00:33:50.790] I feel like because I work in like South Bay,
[00:33:53.410] like more Silicon Valley area.
[00:33:55.850] It's just so much tech and like way more casual.
[00:34:00.150] I can get away with it a lot.
[00:34:01.770] I'll go in with like an oversized hoodie sometimes and it literally doesn't matter.
[00:34:07.190] Yeah.
[00:34:07.690] I mean,
[00:34:08.310] I guess when you're like driving into work,
[00:34:11.330] you don't get perceived as much because you just get out of your car,
[00:34:14.890] go into your office building,
[00:34:15.670] and then immediately get back into your car.
[00:34:17.690] But if you're taking like public transportation or something,
[00:34:20.590] there's just risk of like more people seeing you.
[00:34:23.590] True.
[00:34:24.050] And the city is just a little more alive.
[00:34:26.190] What if after work,
[00:34:27.030] you want to go out and like grab dinner with someone?
[00:34:29.470] Right.
[00:34:29.710] So it just makes more sense to be like a little dressed up just in case something happens.
[00:34:33.690] Maybe there's a happy hour here down in like the South Bay.
[00:34:38.210] Dress however you want.
[00:34:39.550] It doesn't matter.
[00:34:42.610] It's a special perk of being in the Bay Area.
[00:34:45.990] Yeah,
[00:34:46.590] for sure.
[00:34:47.430] Oh,
[00:34:47.990] you know what?
[00:34:48.590] I have one more thing that really makes me feel like an adult.
[00:34:52.450] It's kind of like back to our whole like grocery shopping and errands topic.
[00:34:57.770] But whenever I buy a bunch of meat and then I have to like separate it into portions and then freeze it.
[00:35:07.330] I feel super like an adult in that moment.
[00:35:10.350] Yes,
[00:35:10.710] that's such a good point.
[00:35:13.070] Wombo combo of being economically smart and also just time efficient.
[00:35:18.630] Yes,
[00:35:19.810] that ground pork that I bought.
[00:35:21.730] I went home and I literally portion them out so that it's enough for one.
[00:35:26.710] I don't know meal,
[00:35:27.790] I guess each time if I wanted to use it.
[00:35:30.070] And then I was like,
[00:35:31.090] I'll have to make sure that I kind of squish it out flat.
[00:35:33.870] So it freezes quickly and melts quickly.
[00:35:37.290] All that stuff.
[00:35:38.210] And I like wrote the date.
[00:35:39.730] I was like,
[00:35:40.090] gotta make sure I'm responsible and like can't let the sit out a sit in the freezer for too long.
[00:35:44.770] And after I finished doing that,
[00:35:46.710] I was like,
[00:35:47.130] wow,
[00:35:47.630] I'm truly an adult right now.
[00:35:51.270] I totally agree with this one,
[00:35:52.890] but I have like a exception.
[00:35:55.670] I feel like freezing everything doesn't just automatically make you an adult because sometimes I will make too much rice and I'll freeze it.
[00:36:02.730] And then the rice will just like sit and rot in my freezer.
[00:36:06.110] And I'll just like toss it later and be like,
[00:36:08.110] why,
[00:36:08.290] why did I do that?
[00:36:09.710] Like,
[00:36:09.850] did I think I was going to eat that?
[00:36:11.330] Because I didn't.
[00:36:15.070] So it has to be like you freeze it and then you use it.
[00:36:18.530] Yeah,
[00:36:18.970] exactly.
[00:36:19.490] You have to execute,
[00:36:21.110] you know,
[00:36:22.970] you can't just ideate.
[00:36:24.910] Yes.
[00:36:25.250] Yes.
[00:36:25.510] You're right.
[00:36:25.850] You're right.
[00:36:26.430] I do think portioning it out and putting the date on it though helps a lot because then when you look at it,
[00:36:32.550] you're like,
[00:36:33.230] oh my God,
[00:36:33.610] I put this in almost a month ago.
[00:36:35.650] Like I should probably eat it sooner than later.
[00:36:38.390] Right.
[00:36:38.830] Right.
[00:36:39.490] Damn.
[00:36:39.710] Actually,
[00:36:40.530] this reminds me of another time where I looked at you and I was like,
[00:36:43.850] oh my God,
[00:36:44.250] Crystal's a real adult.
[00:36:46.050] It was like a long time ago.
[00:36:47.890] We did a Tahoe cabin trip with a bunch of our friends.
[00:36:51.050] Yeah.
[00:36:51.570] And the dinner we were going to all cook and eat together was hot pot.
[00:36:55.790] Yeah.
[00:36:56.290] So I was like,
[00:36:57.170] oh,
[00:36:57.330] we'll probably go and get like a bunch of those,
[00:36:59.450] you know,
[00:37:00.050] meats that you can get from HBAR or Ranch 99.
[00:37:02.190] That's like specifically for hot pot.
[00:37:04.130] And then I think you and another one of our friends suggested just getting like bulk meat
[00:37:09.290] and slicing it using your meat slicer.
[00:37:12.010] And we actually did that.
[00:37:13.090] And I was like,
[00:37:13.670] holy shit,
[00:37:14.250] this is crazy.
[00:37:15.810] We're fucking Bear Grills out here slicing our own meat.
[00:37:20.510] Oh my God.
[00:37:21.070] That was fun.
[00:37:21.990] Yeah.
[00:37:22.230] That was me and Jimmy.
[00:37:23.570] Jimmy had like a wholesale connect and we're like,
[00:37:25.550] yeah,
[00:37:25.730] fuck it.
[00:37:26.030] Let's do that.
[00:37:27.450] Yeah.
[00:37:27.950] We made it work and it was pretty nice.
[00:37:30.370] Yeah.
[00:37:31.130] Yeah.
[00:37:31.530] Yeah.
[00:37:31.670] And I feel like moments like that kind of inspired me too.
[00:37:34.070] Sometimes I'll go to the grocery store and I'll walk out with only ingredients,
[00:37:37.830] you know,
[00:37:38.230] like I didn't pick up a sweet treat.
[00:37:39.930] Yeah.
[00:37:40.170] Like I didn't pick up any processed food,
[00:37:42.090] nothing in like packaging.
[00:37:43.010] It's just like veggies and meat and fish or something.
[00:37:45.930] And I'll be like,
[00:37:46.930] wow,
[00:37:47.290] this is it.
[00:37:48.570] That's like,
[00:37:49.250] yeah,
[00:37:49.410] that's true adult.
[00:37:50.610] Right.
[00:37:51.290] Whenever I buy like non frozen foods,
[00:37:53.650] I'm like,
[00:37:54.150] oh yeah,
[00:37:55.230] I'm a real person.
[00:37:56.810] Exactly.
[00:37:57.550] This is farm to table,
[00:37:58.830] baby.
[00:38:00.910] Exactly.
[00:38:02.830] Honestly,
[00:38:03.530] shopping at Costco makes me feel adult like too.
[00:38:06.730] Cause you need the membership and it's,
[00:38:09.070] it's just all stuff that like adults with real families would buy.
[00:38:12.570] That's true.
[00:38:13.570] But sometimes I get tempted by like the croissants or something.
[00:38:16.390] And I'm like,
[00:38:16.730] no,
[00:38:17.430] don't buy this.
[00:38:18.650] Wait,
[00:38:18.950] don't worry.
[00:38:19.490] My dad loves buying the croissants and muffins and he's an adult.
[00:38:22.990] So it's acceptable.
[00:38:25.430] Adult verified.
[00:38:26.770] Yeah.
[00:38:28.150] Well,
[00:38:28.890] I'm glad that we're starting to really feel like we're adults now that we're
[00:38:34.030] almost 30,
[00:38:38.490] but it's really cool that we look at each other and we can recognize moments
[00:38:43.090] where we're like,
[00:38:43.890] wow,
[00:38:44.110] we've really like taken on responsibility and like owned up to whatever needs to
[00:38:49.430] be done.
[00:38:49.830] I think it's almost like a confidence booster chatting about how we've been able
[00:38:54.690] to see ourselves more in those adult shoes and taking on responsibility,
[00:39:00.010] whether we realize it or not.
[00:39:01.790] Maybe it just shows how prepared we're becoming for like the next steps in life.
[00:39:07.510] So for our listeners out there,
[00:39:09.390] if you have any thoughts about things you do that really make you feel like an adult
