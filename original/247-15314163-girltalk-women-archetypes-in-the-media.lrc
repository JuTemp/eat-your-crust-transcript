[00:00:00.180] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. I'm Melissa and I'm Sunny Today we have a Pretty fun topic I think and our slang word is Actually very in line with our topic too. So the slang word we're talking about today is
[00:00:30.560] Bruh girl, so does anyone know what this means? I feel like I'm running a class right now No definition of bro, girl I have definitely heard this word before but I think I heard it a couple years back
[00:00:44.880] So I'm surprised to see that people still kind of use it or maybe it's like coming back in a second wave again But I think I understand it kind of like a tomboy. I think same here
[00:00:55.560] I feel like it's the girl that like can get along with the guys and use the term bra the way that guys do But I can't see that I've seen that word recently so my definition could be dated
[00:01:07.760] Yeah, I'm surprised that it's still like in active use. I actually feel like I've been seeing bro girl More lately. This is the first time that I've seen it and then I've been seeing it more often on my like tik-tok for you page
[00:01:21.680] But yeah, I think you guys are all right And there's some funny definitions here on Urban Dictionary from 2020 The top definition says girls who don't like cheesy messages like good morning Beautiful or I hope you have an amazing day princess. They prefer to be sarcastic and joke around
[00:01:42.480] They would rather a guy say what up stupid or you are a dummy instead I feel like all of those like all four of the example sentences are so bad Are those the only choices I Guess they're just the extremes
[00:02:03.040] But there is also a know your meme page and it looks like one of the originating memes of like bra girl is Girls who say bra versus girls who say hi which with like hella eyes. Oh my god It says originating from a viral meme from
[00:02:23.800] 2018 in which two groups were compared to Disney princesses and The princesses from Shrek and then that's how like it came. Oh my god, the image is hella funny It's like tangled Moana
[00:02:36.720] Cinderella and then the Shrek princesses are all like mean mugging at the camera and they're like buff as fuck Wait Shrek has more than one princess. Yeah Fiona Apparently in Shrek the third there's like more Yeah
[00:02:57.280] This is kind of interesting though because I think part of it I can understand the distinction of Oh someone who's a tomboy Maybe not as externally girly prefers more sarcastic humor
[00:03:08.440] but then the other part of me is like if you are the type of person who wants to be categorized as a Broke girl and seeks that characterization. Are you like a pick me? You know what I mean? Not like someone who is categorized as one
[00:03:22.060] But if you are like, oh I strive to be a bro girl like is that pick me? I feel like it's it's extremely not like other girls energy Yeah, I think I can definitely get that vibe
[00:03:32.880] I think one of the definitions that popped up was like not like the other girls like a bro girl But I always think this is really funny because we have a friend who says bro a lot but she's not necessarily
[00:03:47.000] I would say like a bruh girl or a high girl Like I don't think she's on either end of the spectrum necessarily I feel like she has bro girl habits and then high girl preferences But yeah, I feel like nowadays
[00:04:02.520] Especially maybe in California because I feel like we say words like dude Bro bro, whatever just more often. I don't know Maybe nowadays the distinction of like a bruh girl is not as clear-cut true Yeah, I feel like now saying that like am I a dude girl?
[00:04:20.320] I'm like I can never I can't imagine starting a conversation with bruh But I don't think I can start a conversation without saying dude completely agree
[00:04:29.240] Actually one time I met someone not from California and they're like, did you know you say dude a lot? I was like fuck No So kind of working off of the characterization or archetypes of women
[00:04:44.960] I think another archetype that we see often is the it girl to me this one has a little bit more maybe positive connotations than a bruh girl, but I kind of defined the it girl as someone who
[00:04:58.840] Everyone is paying attention to and is kind of like having a moment So I guess how else would you guys define the it girl? I think I agree Everyone is paying attention to them. I think they have kind of like a natural pull
[00:05:12.520] To like whatever they do and like they unintentionally influence others to kind of match their style or match their mannerisms I guess like for another Gen Z term I feel like if they have like stronger aura and then everyone just kind of like notices them, you know
[00:05:26.440] Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing I was like they have a natural aura and I feel like growing up I kind of think about someone who's like admired by both genders in different ways
[00:05:36.480] Potentially like they have strong influence maybe both males and females and anyone in between I feel like usually they're defined by like certain characteristics to like either
[00:05:46.200] They're very good at a sport or like super talented in a certain way or they maybe present themselves in a way. That is very Admirable if I think about it girls growing up
[00:05:56.240] I'm like, oh I really admired the way maybe they dress or like they did their hair and makeup Maybe certain things about them like really stood out Hmm, I totally resonate with that for like it girls in real life
[00:06:07.640] but do you feel like there's a difference in like it girl in real life like someone you just know and then you think that They're really cool And then there's kind of like an artificial it girl
[00:06:17.080] Aesthetic being pushed on like tick-tock or like Instagram and stuff like that, which in my mind is similar But doesn't necessarily capture the essence of like an IRL it girl Do you think you can name any like tick-tock it girls?
[00:06:31.000] Um, I feel like my 40 page doesn't have a lot of influencers anymore but I feel like there's like a or at least in New York where I am the it girl aesthetic probably
[00:06:42.600] Is really like slick back bun gold hoops white t-shirt type of aesthetic although I might be out of date. I'm not very But I feel like these people are trying to recreate probably like some Originator it girl and then just like starts this kind of trend
[00:06:59.720] I think to me Alex Earl is Probably the it girl of this year last year and I was kind of thinking about it And I feel like what I like about seeing it girls nowadays is I don't think it's necessarily tied to what guys think
[00:07:15.500] I feel like it's very much so formed around the female opinion and I kind of love that it's independent from men because so much of what we're subjected to I feel like is male-dominated
[00:07:27.540] But the it girl is truly like for the girlies like we picked Alex Earl or like we handpicked whoever is the it girl So it makes me feel more unified with the girls almost I'm gonna be honest, I don't know who Alex Earl is
[00:07:42.380] I'm clearly not part of it girl talk But do you feel like Alex girl got it girl status because she's like really conventionally attractive as well I think her popularity with the opposite sex is like something that propelled her to be more it girl worthy
[00:07:58.500] So in a way, it's it kind of feels like she's the it girl because she's the best at doing the male standard That's the sense that I get I think I can see that but I just feel like she's not very popular with guys
[00:08:10.420] And I feel like she's very authentic and post about her journey with acne and like Accutane and all that stuff I feel like it's really her authenticity and genuineness that kind of propelled her forward
[00:08:22.380] But I think you're right like at the base of it to be an it girl You probably have to at least be like conventionally attractive. So what does she do on tik-tok? She posted like her college life of going to University of Miami
[00:08:35.900] And then she got really big because she would post really honestly about like partying and like sorority life Acne all that stuff and then she'll post like her dirty room and be like, oh I have to clean shit
[00:08:46.700] Just like stuff that's very normal and like day to day that people don't always post about I'll have to look into her later Do some research on the Gen Z a girl But I do agree with what everyone is saying I think you're right
[00:09:01.060] There does have to be a certain level of pull like you all mentioned from both genders But maybe leaning a little more for like the girls because in my mind like an it girl
[00:09:12.140] starts trends whether they mean to or not and I feel like these trends happen with the gender associated with the girl Yeah, I'm thinking about other it girls that maybe also somewhat stemmed from tik-tok fame
[00:09:24.820] Like I don't know if any of you follow like Matilda girl for like Sofia Richie I feel like they were also kind of in the same realm of Alex Earl and that like they're conventionally attractive
[00:09:35.860] but I think a lot of their following comes from the girlies and it's because they're kind of like fashion icon or They start trends that kind of become very viral I feel like I learned about
[00:09:47.940] Matilda girth and like her entire like clothing brand because I feel like everyone kept calling her like the it girl for like new Style and trends and like a lot of her she's obviously from Europe
[00:09:58.080] But I think her influence was very happy in New York within the fashion scenes So I feel like even though they might have some slight influence across both genders
[00:10:07.300] I think most of the virality comes from girlies following them and like leading into their trends that they started. Mm-hmm Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, dude I also just had a thought because we've been discussing mostly like it girls within the tik-tok space
[00:10:21.580] But I was thinking about like it girls over the past few years And I feel like one maybe more like specific it girl for a group is Kpop people so I was starting to think about like I don't know like Jennie
[00:10:35.220] Blackpink and that's kind of like an it girl group And then also that kind of feeds into whole thing where kpop kind of tries to manufacture it girls and then that's part of the Virality and like popularity that they lean on to get their groups big
[00:10:52.080] I think it's really true that like different spheres will have different it girls We have been mentioning to talk but I feel like back when Instagram was more popular I feel like there was a whole other
[00:11:00.660] Cast of like people who are really popular on Instagram and then people who are really popular on YouTube Maybe certain like makeup gurus or something like that Like maybe they can be considered it girls in like their space true and not to throw it back
[00:11:13.920] Super old or anything but tumblr it girls. Oh my god I just remember this one account Jasmine blue and she would post the most like coquette stuff with bows on her socks and all of that and
[00:11:24.480] She to me was like the it girl from that era. Oh my god tumblr it girls are so funny It would be like all these photos of themselves and then like Moody as fuck quote picture
[00:11:43.000] Times are simpler back then. Yeah, actually I feel like now that tick tock has like this slideshow feature or when they've created the slideshow I was like, I literally feel like we're back at like Cuz there was that like whole phase of like all these like sad
[00:11:56.680] Quote II type of slideshows. I was like dude, this is like I Guess so many slideshows now I'm also thinking back tumblr days Like you mentioned I feel like one of the original it girls was Serena van der woods in from Gossip Girl
[00:12:14.540] True. I didn't watch Gossip Girl when I was coming out Okay, based on a few seasons that I've watched now. I feel like Blair is more it girl, right? Oh, that's the big argument it's you know, very split between Blair fans and Serena
[00:12:31.860] Interesting interesting interesting. All right, I will say I'm a Blair fan, but I'm kind of leaning towards Serena being the it girl in the Gossip Girl world because I feel like what makes someone an it girl in my mind is
[00:12:45.300] They can't be chasing an aesthetic themselves sort of like their aesthetic is true to them And I feel like Blair pushes a certain look but Serena is kind of like nonchalant about it
[00:12:55.620] She's like, oh and everyone's just like throw something on and then she gets popped and it's like in the papers or whatever True the effortlessness of it all
[00:13:05.540] Yeah, I think that's a big feature too I think especially in social media heavy world where everyone's kind of pushing an aesthetic I feel like sometimes it Seems like everyone's not dressing in an outfit. Everyone's like kind of dressing the character or like putting on a costume almost
[00:13:20.340] Yeah, so I feel like the it girl Transcends beyond that creates their own path agreed. But besides like the it girl. Do you think there's other archetypes Slash characterizations of women that we're seeing more of because I feel like back in the day, you know
[00:13:38.140] It's mainly just like the it girl But now I feel like with social media and just like the internet being so big there's definitely more Archetypes one of the ones that we named was like bra girl. So is there anything else?
[00:13:52.260] I guess like what is your for you page catered towards? What kind of girl are you? I feel like answering your first question. I think there's definitely a proliferation of all these different kinds of aesthetics and labels and like archetypes, I don't know exactly
[00:14:09.620] Why that is I have like a few theories like one of them is it's basically like that meme It's like oh like when you turn 30 you can choose between craft beer or like I don't know something else as your personality
[00:14:19.940] it's like you can just choose one of these laid-out characters to be your personality and then Everyone on the internet will give you suggestions. What you should wear is the books you should read the aesthetic should carry You don't have to do that much
[00:14:34.020] Independent thought to kind of forge your own path in that regard You can just kind of pick an aesthetic and be like, all right And I feel like the plus side of us I guess like really convenient
[00:14:44.460] I think the negative side of that is like I feel like it encourages people to put you in a box, right? Like oh, I'm gonna be cottagecore aesthetic girly and then people will look at that and be like, okay
[00:14:55.940] Like she's caught a course that I kind of like get to know her really I know she's gonna like this and know she's gonna do that and then it kind of just allows you to have like a more shallow person a box type of interaction
[00:15:06.500] I don't know if that makes sense. But like yeah, I think that makes total sense. We're just categorizing people now Yeah, you're like playing one of those like video games. You like choose a character. Yeah, that's your that's your class
[00:15:18.100] You're like this is the group that I want to become friends with so I'm now cottagecore Yeah, I feel like there's probably like a marketing aspect to it as well I feel like it's easier for companies to kind of push an aesthetic and then
[00:15:31.860] Position themselves in such a way that they're best suited to fulfill that aesthetic You know just like carve out niches in the market that way, but that's like a hyper cynical I think your theory about like
[00:15:43.980] having less independent thought and like kind of almost having like a guideline or like a rubric to follow is very true because I think if you very much like like or Admire a certain aesthetic or you see that a lot
[00:15:59.600] I think part of you just like wants to be part of that and if a lot of things are already outlined for you Like oh you should wear your hair way or like have
[00:16:08.420] This kind of makeup or like dress the style in order to like fit in with this aesthetic in a way maybe Identity wise you feel some level of achievement almost like oh I can fit in with these types of people that I really admire
[00:16:23.860] Again, I don't have to think so freely about like Oh how I should wear my hair every day or like what brands or like types of clothing I should wear And I don't think there's any like necessarily cons to that
[00:16:33.980] I think it can become part of your personal style and like that is ever-changing so it's very interesting to me to like see how these different archetypes continue to evolve as we as like social media trends grow or like I
[00:16:47.140] Don't know. I feel like back then there was like the emo girl and that was really cool and like middle school, but now I'm like Hardly ever see that but maybe it's just cuz like that's not
[00:16:57.540] What's trending on like social media or like other platforms and like people around me? Yeah I think it's interesting Too because I totally agree about like you feel a sense of achievement to try to fit in with people that you admire
[00:17:08.860] I think the other angle of that is like the authenticity part that you mentioned earlier because I feel like There's probably a really quick trend cycle now because it's like some aesthetic emerges
[00:17:20.620] People really want to emulate it and then other people are like, oh but then it's not authentic It's just like you're just copying everyone and the new style emerges and then like the more styles there are
[00:17:30.980] And the more easier of a rubric there is I feel like this the trend cycles just get faster and faster I think my brain also kind of goes to
[00:17:39.300] these aesthetics living in relativity of each other so, you know if we were to all live in a vacuum and Not see other people and etc I feel like you would truly be like your own self, but because we're constantly interacting with people looking at different content
[00:17:54.420] I feel like you're forced to kind of pick a lane and in some ways. I think people could be Pressured to fit into the most common label that they see for example, but then in other ways
[00:18:05.220] I feel like you might be drawn to something that feels a little bit more unique like oh everyone else is Chasing VSCO girl aesthetic like maybe I should be the bruh girl or something. So I feel like it's all relative, right?
[00:18:15.060] It's like what is my personality or what is my look relative to other people's and do I want to be the unique person? Or do I want to be like the common folk? No, I think I think what you're saying is true there's like a natural equilibrium
[00:18:32.020] Yeah, and I feel like it's super different based on the culture of the country, too I can see in maybe more like homogeneous populations like in Asia or something Maybe you want to fit into what everyone else is doing and then maybe in America
[00:18:44.860] There's that added layer of we should seek out uniqueness and you know find our true selves So then it's more complexity on top of that. Do you feel like you have a different? Aesthetic or even personality based on like where you are so for example
[00:19:02.900] When we're like home in California or when you're in school Which might not be where home is or when you're like living in New York like Mel I think for me, yes, and I think it also depends on
[00:19:17.980] The people that I'm with too and kind of like what the group of people needs or something You know, like there's like some sort of balance right like two different personality types. It can't be all the same personality type
[00:19:30.420] so then I feel like depending on what I feel is needed like Different qualities of me come out or like I set certain qualities aside Actually, I feel like that's a good point I feel like some of my college friends and I have discussed
[00:19:44.540] Something kind of similar where it's like some people are better at taking charge in planning than others. So depending on the group that You're in like you might be the person who is best at taking charge and then you'll take charge or
[00:19:57.580] Your other friend might be better and then you'll just like defer to them and then there's I don't say hierarchy Like I know these people are better at like planning stuff than I am and I know these people would prefer if I plan it
[00:20:08.260] So I feel like depending on the group that I'm in my active or passive role Switches. Hmm. So like cottagecore girl gets to plan the cabin trip Cottagecore girl can plan the activities at the cabin trip
[00:20:23.380] But then the cabin trip itself probably should be planned by like the not chill girl, you know CEO boss girl They have like they have different we have different roles It's really interesting because I feel like sometimes you might fall into like a certain archetype
[00:20:44.380] Based on like maybe the look you're going for but your personality might not exactly match that so I kind of feel like it's it's this strange dichotomy of like visually, I might look like an AVG, but I feel like I
[00:20:57.340] More closely align my personality and like type to I don't know if a chill girl or the boss Because I do think that like sometimes you might be like into certain trends that fall into like an archetype but
[00:21:10.820] Your personality is a little bit more fixed. I think then like you're kind of like external appearance in certain ways So I'm trying to think through like Sunny's the CEO AVG Literally neither of them. She's the CEO of all AVG We are all her board members I
[00:21:41.020] Do have one thought though I don't know if this is maybe just me or the influence of social media or something but a lot of these characterizations of women especially like
[00:21:51.860] Fisco girl or bra girl like all of these things I feel are very geared towards women in a specific age bracket That maybe we are Slightly aging out of so then now that I look at these as like a late 20s women I'm like, okay
[00:22:09.220] This is like me when I was in high school or maybe me in college or like me before 25 And now that I'm past 25 I feel like I am more cemented in my personality and maybe a little bit less
[00:22:19.420] Subjected to these micro trends in terms of how it affects me like internally So then why do you think we care about women in this certain age bracket so much? Like why are there so many words to define them and characterize them? You know what I mean?
[00:22:33.340] Actually, I do have a bit of a theory on this This is the age where you have the least amount of responsibility and the world has not crushed you yet So So we can observe how these younger people are, you know defining themselves
[00:22:51.940] How what they think is cool But then so I'm thinking you know us and like people who are a little older who are you know starting to become moms You know, they have all these additional responsibilities like imagine
[00:23:06.380] Taking care of a screaming child and at the same time you're like, oh my god I need to worry about like what is in and what I need to wear So for them, it's like oh, okay. Like what's the it girl wearing? Like what's trendy now that way?
[00:23:20.860] I don't have to think and I can focus on my like responsibilities. So that's just my theory Like I think people of that age probably spend the most time on social media
[00:23:33.300] So I think just like as a product of how much time they spend they can make the definitions a lot more granular And I also think that like us women over 25. We definitely do have different archetypes
[00:23:46.740] They're just not like maybe the same ones as like below 25 like the drug girl chill party girl, whatever I feel like it kind of adjust a little bit more. Yeah, I think I'd agree with that
[00:23:56.900] I feel like sometimes when you're in your teens and then going into college and maybe even a little bit post grad You're still kind of like figuring out who you are
[00:24:05.620] And I think that goes with like the people you surround yourself with maybe even like your career and like also the kind of like characterization you want to Like identify yourself with so I feel like there's just so much change
[00:24:20.700] Happening during those years and that kind of leads to having so many different types of girls or like these types of micro labels But I do think that post 25 and even like crystal I think you just described being on as an example
[00:24:36.300] I still feel like there are certain types Going into like your 30s and beyond just that your life might be a lot more stable or hopefully maybe Could be more stable then so maybe the characterizations or these archetypes are like a lot more streamlined
[00:24:52.500] They're not as out there or there aren't as many categories, but I still think that to a certain extent like you might see certain people on social media and Still be able to like identify with them and fall into certain like
[00:25:07.580] Categories as you age. I think that makes sense And I wonder if a part of it too is maybe at that age You're a little bit more insecure as a person and you're more I don't want to say vulnerable
[00:25:20.380] But you are more of like open to seeking out these like new characterization types of like oh Where could I fit in versus when you're older like you said crystal? It's like less and less of a priority almost to like try to align to one of those things
[00:25:32.900] but I think the other half of me also wonders if There is just more scrutiny and more attention paid to women in that age bracket So like maybe teenage girls slash like early 20s girls because I remember at least me growing up
[00:25:48.300] I used to like really fangirl over certain idol groups And I remember in the Korean media There was always like this thing about oh like these fangirls like these fangirls have so many issues blah blah but then I would think about
[00:26:02.940] Teenage guys my age at the time like really being fans of like sports teams or something, right? But that was never an issue It was only an issue that teenage girls were fangirling over idol groups
[00:26:14.660] But whoever the guys were fanning over like they didn't care or like scrutinize. So I think growing up I always wondered why does society care so much about like girls of this age? When they don't pay nearly enough attention to guys that age
[00:26:29.260] Whoa, wait, that's crazy because now that I think about it Like we have a lot of different categories that we've been describing this whole time but Not to shit on guys But I feel like for guys if there's like one popular haircut
[00:26:45.060] Every single guy will get it and then like not to say there's just one but there's like Much more limited archetypes within the male space that we see on externally Versus like what we're aware of within the like girl space
[00:27:00.740] Do you feel like that's cuz we're not guys so we don't know the details of it Like I feel like if we asked a guy they would be like, what is cottage court?
[00:27:11.700] Think I would agree with that. Yeah, I feel like the guys also discuss it. Yeah, that's fair. We're not broad girl enough That's fair, I guess like we just see from the external point of view what the it boy is so like right now
[00:27:27.540] It's I don't know mullets or like middle part Yeah, I agree with you say like I think there is a lot of scrutiny on What teenage girls and like young women like and don't like and what they're like? I don't want to like make a very sad point
[00:27:43.860] But I think a little bit of it is like misogyny like things that teenage girls like just tend to be Ridicule and stuff like that like boys can like rock bands or whatever But if girls really like Taylor Swift and it's kind of cringe or whatever
[00:27:56.140] All this stuff is like taking really trivially even though it's not fundamentally different than what other people do And I think that makes me feel like complicated feelings about these micro labels because I think in a positive light I can look at this and be like Oh
[00:28:13.260] If I really wanted to like I have all these options laid out in front of me and it makes it easier Right, like we mentioned earlier like there's a rubric already that exists. There's like a framework but then in another way I'm like I
[00:28:25.740] Can't help but feel like we're dicing up these different personalities or maybe like these different aesthetics that people have Just so we can like pick a new micro label to like shit on kind of and not us by like as in like we
[00:28:39.380] But I feel like as a society There's constantly something female that is getting shit on and then by having all these micro labels I'm like, oh my god, like we're more vulnerable, which is not like the most positive way to look at it
[00:28:51.100] But I do feel like it is something that happens I think that goes back to what I was mentioning before. It's like also a way to like dismiss getting to know you It's like oh like they're just this kind of person because they dress like this or that
[00:29:04.580] They follow this aesthetic or like whatever. That's like the disheartening aspect the positive aspect. Yeah, it's like it's kind of fun You can dress up your character in so many different ways Your character you mean yourself
[00:29:18.620] But all this talk about like certain archetypes get shit on like for a period of time Really reminds me of like do you guys know Nara Smith on on tik-tok? She's basically this woman who will say shit like oh we ran out of toothpaste
[00:29:34.580] So we decided to just make our own Whole like, you know segment of making it in her house and people are like you ran out of toothpaste But you have like one of these obscure ingredients available to make toothpaste when she like just like benzoyl peroxide
[00:29:53.220] Fluoride in her I Think like when she first started making videos, it's like somewhat authentic I think that she does truly do a lot of like cooking and things like that But people the initial reaction was just shitting on her like oh my god
[00:30:11.300] You're such a housewife like doing all this, you know Cooking from scratch and that kind of stuff but she powered through I guess and she kept posting and now it's like She's like really leaning into that whole thing where part of her Videos are more sarcastic now
[00:30:27.700] Like the toothpaste one was like kind of satirical almost She like plays into the joke a little bit more and now people like love her after she got through that initial bump of Criticism or I don't even know if it was necessarily criticism
[00:30:43.260] It was more just like people hating on her but then at a certain point I started seeing comments being like You know what? Like I fucking get it now like like you fucking go to her Smith
[00:30:54.220] And now she's like super popular in a positive way versus like the negative way in the beginning and I feel like there's just this like whiplash of
[00:31:04.060] You know one second you're being hated on for what you're doing and then the next second it's like cool and then you're like, okay Where was this positive?
[00:31:12.820] Reaction when I was doing it dude, it makes me think about you know how in Stardew Valley when you go and catch fish There's like a mini game so it's like a like a fishing rod and then you have to get your
[00:31:26.540] Marker in like a very specific range Otherwise the fish will run away and I feel like that's very much something that happens to female celebrities When you're on the rise You're like so cool
[00:31:38.340] And then you hit a certain point and then people love you like can't get enough and then once you pass that point of popularity You're like the person to go and shit on and
[00:31:48.900] I feel like I've seen that happen so much where it's like when you're on the rise like you can't say a single thing That's wrong. And then once you're past like the peak every time you open your mouth, it's like a controversy. I
[00:32:00.820] Think I see that a lot as well. It's kind of like you're just basically breaching saturation I think you become too cool And then people the cooler thing to do is to hate on you and then the cycle restarts Everything is just like that trend cycle
[00:32:14.980] but it's like if you're too cool then like people think that liking this person is just like not authentic and then like You're cooler for having an original thought of disliking this person That's true. And then it becomes cooler to have the original thought of liking them
[00:32:31.980] Exactly exactly so don't worry I feel like in another six months and our Smith will get ridiculed again I Have a I have an activity for us to do if you could come up with like three words to describe your own archetype
[00:32:49.540] Whoa, just on the spot like that First way you go first shit harder Chill Okay, you know what I'm gonna reduce it down to two words How can I reduce my entire personality those two words Okay, sorry two to three words mine is literally not chill
[00:33:27.940] Aspirational a chill oh This is giving like describe yourself in three words. Oh my god That's literally that's kind of essentially what you asked Okay, actually how about this I'm gonna change the question How about we name two or three archetypes that we think we went through?
[00:33:56.340] Do you have a word bank? Oh, okay, so I guess there was like tumblr scene girl emo ABG chill not chill It girl girly girl bra girl VSCO girl Is there anything else that was like really popular cottagecore girl? We can't forget her
[00:34:23.980] Dude manic pixie dream girl. Oh, that was like a niche but popular Oh My god, I actually learned a new term as well. This one's really funny it's by adjacent and it's basically like you've adopted some of the like fashion trends of like by people but you're
[00:34:45.060] Unfortunately not by that's like this definition Unfortunately, you like Unfortunately, you're straight So that's also an Archetype like alt girl, I guess true. I think this question feels a lot easier now I think I had a bruh girl phase for sure when I was in my pick-me era
[00:35:10.020] So then that was a big one And then I feel like it kind of went into the party girl phase for a little bit Like, you know like the Paris Hilton like Lindsay Lohan like that kind of aesthetic And then now I'm seeking new aesthetics
[00:35:25.700] Open to new role You're ready for your next role Yeah, I feel like I probably had a pretty girl phase as well, but now I feel like the by adjacent is kind of fitting I feel like certain aspects of the way I dress maybe or slightly but unfortunately
[00:35:51.140] Just resonate with that part Like I think piercings is like a big one too for the like that fashion niche Yeah I feel like I see a lot of comedy content on tik-tok where it's like how to clock if someone is like queer and I'm
[00:36:06.140] Like wait, I do all of those things Unfortunately Like down I think I as well at one point probably was somewhat adjacent to the party girl aesthetic and I think I also had like an aspiring gym rat. Oh Oh
[00:36:30.340] I think we didn't touch that. We didn't we didn't touch on the fitness. It's a huge like Pilates. Yes, like long walks Outdoorsy girl That's not me the couch girl, yeah, I'm like totally okay never seen another nature like allergic to nature
[00:36:57.060] Well, it's fun to see in a very very controlled manner like a manicured park But like the great outdoors is the wild I'm Truly domestic. Oh My god, isn't there also like the rat girl? Have you guys do you guys remember that one? I feel like I've heard
[00:37:17.220] But I feel like the records like just like very chaotic energy I think it was like potato at home. I guess it's just like you're not really trying to leave the house So you're just like ratty I guess Okay
[00:37:32.860] So rat girl summer is a tick-tock trend that advises young women to act like a city rat in the summer as in lurk around snack on treats and live unabashedly That's crazy, dude
[00:37:45.860] You have to scurry outside because you cannot scurry in bed and you have to nibble on any food you like Nibble only I'm Probably like I'm trying to think of the appropriate kind of like you were saying like indoorsy, you know, like potato couch girl, I guess Oh
[00:38:13.580] Homebody kind of a homebody girl. Although now I think a little less so but during kovat dude prime homebody time Thriving I'm still stuck on that chill girl Can we define chill girl of it works? That's such a vague
[00:38:32.500] Okay, actually I did get a few tick tock sent to me and the archetype was rather than chill girl It was nonchalant girl. Oh Yeah I think I saw the same kind of like a deep. Yeah. Yeah a little bit most things you're like, oh, you know
[00:38:51.420] That's totally fine. And then maybe you draw the line somewhere So the joke in those tick tocks was like, oh you don't like cats like sorry. This isn't gonna work Yeah, I can see that. I feel like you're very nonchalant. I can't imagine crystal like yelling at someone
[00:39:05.740] Yeah, I mostly would just be like oh Shit that might be me. I Had like a random thought just now but You guys remember the spice girls? Mm-hmm. How there was like sporty spice and like posh spice and stuff like is that
[00:39:27.540] The og characterization of woman like is that the original four quadrants that we were allowed to? What were the four quadrants do you remember you said posh spicy spicy There's the sexy one the tomboy one, okay, so there was scary spice scary sporty spice Yeah, scary
[00:39:53.020] baby spice posh spice and ginger spice There's no ice I Spice is her own like modern Artists. Yeah, she's she's like she's a rapper. I think She's not like affiliated with the spice family She made her own spice That's that's crazy What that's like What?
[00:40:38.110] Smells like they need to sue her Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Like is she like try to cover it? It's like if I if I had a stage name that was like Melissa Timberlake or something Trying to capitalize on something that's obviously much more popular
[00:40:54.430] That's surprising but that makes more sense No, this is really interesting I'm also now reading which spice girl are you might have been the ultimate Cosmo quiz and preteen sleepover debate of the late 90s
[00:41:07.990] Like basically you're trying to figure out like which archetype you fit in most closely with Wait, so one of them you said is ginger spice. Is that just like you're a ginger and that's a whole category
[00:41:21.470] I think she was just a ginger. I don't know what her like personality That's her whole assigned ginger effort Do also scary spice Ginger spice was formerly sexy spice. Oh You're like fiery sexually liberated and outspoken actually that makes a lot of sense
[00:41:47.670] I was like, they couldn't have just named her ginger cuz she's a ginger I think scary spices. These 90s teenage girls at these sleepovers would have loved Okay, so which spice are we can you name them again? Yeah scary spice ginger slash sexy spice sporty spice
[00:42:09.870] Baby spice and posh spice. I think baby spice would probably be like what what's that powerpuff girl? Oh my god all the time. Yeah, like kind of I Fucking love bubble And then maybe scary spice is kind of like the girl boss aesthetic. Oh, yes
[00:42:30.110] Very similar. It's a scary source is wild and crazy Like you're kind of like party girl Oh, but I think I think ginger spice or sexy spice is supposed to be like boss girl and like fierce I see. Yes the one who worked hardest to promote their feminist
[00:42:47.030] Mmm, so Sorry, this is making me think of powerpuff girls now So bubbles is baby spice and buttercup is scary spice and is blossom was the other one like regular Regular ice ice
[00:43:05.270] Dude blossom has orange hair. Maybe she's ginger spice but blossom was like sweet and nice leadership, right? So who's that in the green one? Green is buttercup. She's scary spice. Do I feel like buttercup would be sporty spice? Oh
[00:43:22.590] Mmm, like more tomboy vibe. Yeah, actually maybe yeah. Oh my god talking about cartoons like Jason watch Teen Titans Yes, I feel like Raven in teen things was like my my icon like she was my eight girl Oh my god first
[00:43:37.990] I feel like I laid eyes on her when I was like at a young impressionable age and I was like I want to be her like she is me and I'm her I can totally see that Right. Yeah, I'm like Raven's not core, but she is very cool
[00:43:50.690] well, I would say I'm a blend of buttercup and Maybe bubbles minus the crying so that makes me That makes me sporty and baby spice, right? Oh, I can see it I feel like I would be a mix of like do I don't know
[00:44:09.090] I'm so like the scary spice thing is really appealing to me. I should just go for that Own it. I Feel like scary spice is more appealing to me before I knew the description like if there's if she was just like scary just terrifying
[00:44:31.250] She's like the ring or the grudge Well Now that we have kind of established our own archetypes via Spice Girls Kind of going back to what we talked about earlier in regards to a lot of these like trends and archetypes
[00:44:51.530] Being started by or affecting people who are under 25 a little more than people who are you know around our age And or older do you ever feel like it's weird to I guess observe that and see how like all these
[00:45:07.250] New trends or like cool things are so much more like youth focus where it's like Oh, yeah, like maybe I would have loved that if I were you know a few years younger. I think it's definitely
[00:45:19.090] Interesting to see it in action. I feel like it's one thing for me to see the abstract like oh, yeah Instagram but like I recently went to a concert and I think the artist playing the concert is probably like in college
[00:45:32.970] Like they look really young and then the crowd was really young And then I was like seeing the archetypes kind of in real life, and I was like, whoa Like there's a lot of coquette stuff and like a lot of like bows that kind of girly academia
[00:45:47.210] Look, it was a little bit jarring to see it actually actualized in a way and then I feel like it almost deterred me a little bit from like actually trying to
[00:45:59.470] Join an aesthetic know that I typically do that that much but then I was like, oh like I feel like I'm a little aged out of it. And then it made me feel really old Yeah, I
[00:46:12.490] Guess it is kind of sobering saying that I remember one time you and I Mel we went to a concert in New York and Everyone was super young. Yeah, we kept seeing X's on people's hands Because they were under 21 and they couldn't get drinks and we were like
[00:46:31.350] It does make me think like if I was back in college What I'd be following you this aesthetic or what? I have followed a different one Like I feel like there's definitely like each college probably has its own
[00:46:42.990] Trends and like stuff that people wear so I don't know if East Coast colleges have the same as like California colleges It was really interesting. I was like, I feel like good What is it like sociologists like observing? like a new population I
[00:47:00.990] Definitely feel like I've aged out of a lot of these trends like I feel like things that have been very popular amongst like y2k Like Leroy's or like micro mini skirts. I Have nothing against it and I actually think it's really cute on like that generation
[00:47:14.550] I just think that there's part of me that like no longer cares to like be trendy in that way I'm like, I know that that's not something that is really in line with my personal style, but I like it So I'll like consume content about it
[00:47:26.870] But I do think that some other trends like for example, like bows in your hair or like that kind of look I feel like was really popular kind of went viral all over social media and I feel like
[00:47:38.990] It started with like the younger age groups like the kind of Gen Z folks But then I think it it infiltrated its way into like older influencers and because I saw older influencers like kind of adopting that trend I was like more open to
[00:47:52.110] Like trying it out and stuff So I think it really depends on what like the cool thing or like the it thing is But I do think that in order for me to like try it out
[00:48:01.990] It feels a little bit more comfortable when I see like people our age or maybe even older like doing something similar The power of influencers, I totally agree If the influencer is like slightly closer to your age or like your life situation or like you just feel more
[00:48:17.550] Relatable or they feel more relatable to you. Then it's just like yeah, like I'll definitely do what they do I feel like the age thing to me Manifests in the form of like what I yearn to be and like what I'm seeking out now Maybe in college
[00:48:31.830] I would be like oh like this kind of outfit or like this kind of look is so cute Like I should go out and buy it versus now I'm like, oh my god This person wakes up at 5 a.m
[00:48:41.270] Every day and like works out before work like that's goals or like oh this person Makes bread from scratch at home Like I would love to do you know Like I feel like it's now more about like actions for me or like things that they do
[00:48:53.310] Versus like the look or the aesthetic so then in that sense. I I think I want to emulate different things now Mmm, it's a very good point. I didn't even think about yeah like now that you mentioned it. I'm like, oh, yeah
[00:49:07.230] I think I'm kind of similar to that too. Yeah, like lifestyle choices or just right things outside of just like Apparel or like other visual trends dude. Does this mean that as we got older we? Care more deeply about what's not just on the surface
[00:49:28.150] Crazy question or thought I Think it it does like shift a little bit Although I will say I haven't let go of like the aesthetic thing But I think it's now more like home decor some shit, you know what I mean?
[00:49:42.230] I'm like, how do I decorate my home like this influence? Wait, but that's such a like bigger trap, you know Like at least if you're trying to chase trends you can go to fast fashion as like terrible as that may be but like furniture like
[00:49:55.310] You buy a couch and you're like, okay That was like a thousand dollars and like actually the chop the couch trends have changed You're like why did I just pay rent on a couch that is no longer in
[00:50:10.270] Yeah, I guess like so much harder the activation energy is But I guess that's why I like like as we get older like we can participate in stuff like this well, I think it was very fun to explore our thoughts on our own archetypes on
