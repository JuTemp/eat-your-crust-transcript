[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. And I'm Crystal. So Jeesoo, I have a word for us to discuss. Oh my god, that rhymed. Alright, let's hear this word.
[00:00:24.260] So it is actually an acronym, which I guess now that we've talked about it enough, Gen Z does use acronyms, just like very sparingly. So the acronym is FR, and it can also be used as BFFR. Ooh, I actually know this one. So faux real or be fucking faux real.
[00:00:48.940] Yes, exactly. So I think like I've seen this acronym. Top example I can think of right now is like a video is showing something or someone is describing something and it just sounds so unhinged and like unreal that the comments are like, are you for real? So like, are you FR? Or some people will just straight up comment like BFFR. Like basically, I don't believe you, kind of.
[00:01:17.600] True. I think the first time I heard it too, kind of like live, was when Be Real was really popular. The notification on everyone's phone popped up for like, oh, time to take your Be Real. And then someone was like, oh, BFFR, like it's time to be fucking faux real. Basically like using it to say, let's take our Be Real photos. Yeah. I was like kind of mind blown because I didn't think that it could be applied that way. Right. Like it's time for us to be fucking for real. Yeah.
[00:01:48.680] To be real. So I guess FR, BFFR, BR. True. Dude, also, this is like slightly going to expose me, but I've been having this really weird new addiction on TikTok. And basically what it is, is it's screenshots of people texting their crush. I read the Korean ones and the American ones, and it's usually like high school students because that's really the age where you have a crush.
[00:02:17.360] And then beyond that, you know, you don't really have crushes anymore, I feel. But I see the way high school students text each other, I guess, through my addiction of these things. And they use a lot of like shortened words, which I was mind blown. So FR is on there a lot like, oh, are you for real? Or sometimes it's kind of used like, oh, it's so hot outside. And then the other person will be like, FR, like I agree with you for real.
[00:02:44.400] But then sometimes if it's too FR, so it's like FR, FR, then it's like for real, for real. And then it's like, I don't know if it means like, yes, I totally agree with you so much that I want to say FR twice. Or if it's like FR, FR as in like question mark, like are you for real, for real? Oh, that's kind of confusing. Okay. There's so many applications of this acronym. It's like too many. I know.
[00:03:14.180] It's crazy. The other two like shortened words that I saw were ACC, which just means actually. Oh. And I had no idea people use this as like an acronym, which doesn't even make sense because actually it isn't spelled with two C's. Yeah, I was thinking accuracy. Like what? And then the other one was they shortened BRUH. So we type it out typically like B-R-U-H. Yes. But they shorten it to B-R-U.
[00:03:44.880] And then I was like, this isn't even worth shortening. Okay. There's something that I do sometimes, which I think I've seen other people do it too. But it's like shortening a word to one letter. So like if I were to say like, oh, that's pretty cool over text, I might type like, oh, that's P-cool. I do that too. And I guess pretty, so P, and then very for V, like those are really good ones to do it for. Yeah.
[00:04:14.520] I've also done like I'm D, like I'm down. True. Oh, and you shorten O to O. Oh, that's true. So drop the H. That's true. Okay. I think because like O without the H is so funny. It's just like literally what your mouth is doing, right? You're like, oh. I also feel like I imagine it as a shorter sound. Like O-H is like O. And then O is like O. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:04:43.520] Dude, O is just too good. It is. I love using just O. Okay. Back to like be real and be fucking for real. Urban Dictionary says BFFR is a saying commonly used by people in the midst of conversation to get the other person to be real with themselves about a specific topic.
[00:05:07.960] So I guess that is like another more like convoluted way to use this where it's like BFFR with yourself. I guess I guess it like I guess it like kind of is similar to the don't lie kind of thing. Like I think you're lying. So I guess it's a way of like calling someone out be like be fucking for real because I don't think this is true and you probably know it's not true.
[00:05:37.160] Like that kind of angle. Yeah, I can totally see that. And I feel like I don't know where to put it on the aggressiveness scale because on the same scale is like the phrase come on. You know, like you say come on when someone's kind of like BSing you or you feel like they're stretching with the truth. You're just like come on. Yeah. Which isn't that aggressive, but be fucking faux real. Like when you say those actual words out loud, it's like you're you want to fight someone.
[00:06:05.580] But BFFR is kind of in the midpoint, I guess, where it's like slightly more aggressive than come on because it's more straightforward. But yeah, it's enshrouded in like an acronym. So not as bad, maybe. Maybe. And I think I've only seen it in text BFFR. I don't think people necessarily say it in person as much like a BFFR.
[00:06:26.760] But I always imagine when I'm reading it that it's like B fucking for like super dramatic with like pauses in between each word. So yeah, it's definitely got like a bit of aggressive factor to it. I guess the one and only time I've ever heard it in real life. It was like, oh, my God, BFFR. And then I was like, what is that? Embarrassing question. I was like, what is that? And then she was like, be fucking faux real. So it didn't feel as aggressive.
[00:06:54.460] But maybe today's mission will be to use it in our episode at least once. I'll try. I'll try my best. So I guess moving on from our Gen Z word this week, I thought our topic was kind of cute and fun. And I think it'll kind of be a way for us to reflect a little bit on our childhood and how we've seen the environment around us change. So the topic today is talking about life in the Bay Area.
[00:07:21.060] What are some unique things that we've experienced in the Bay and how we've seen it evolve over the years? So let's kind of kick this off by talking about the different areas in the Bay. How would you describe the different areas that you've lived in or visited? And what are the unique differences for each section? Hmm. So I mostly have spent my time living in the Bay, in the East Bay.
[00:07:46.780] I guess it's more like Southeast Bay because I think a lot of people consider Oakland first when they hear East Bay because it's directly east of San Francisco. I think in general, East Bay is kind of considered a little more like older and therefore like slightly more run down, I guess. Just like less new buildings popping up. So a lot of homes are like older and like streets and buildings in general are older.
[00:08:15.160] I guess it kind of makes sense, too, because it's like mostly suburbs anyway. And I don't think people are trying to like build giant like office buildings really in these areas. Because of that, though, the housing prices are slightly lower compared to other parts of the Bay. Yeah, it's kind of interesting that you say that because so I grew up in the South Bay, specifically like Cupertino area.
[00:08:38.540] I always felt like Cupertino had no, I don't want to say no culture, but kind of no culture. Like there's not a ton of history at Cupertino. And you can tell because our like high school mascot is like a pioneer. And like, I don't know, there's just all of this alluding to like, oh, the gold rush era. Because I feel like that was the last time this area had any sort of history or culture. And then in contrast, I felt like East Bay seemed a little bit cooler to me.
[00:09:09.340] Because I don't know, they it kind of seemed like there was more going on. And I think it's changed a little bit now. Definitely when we were in college was when Cupertino started to be like the cool city. But at least when we were in high school, I would like drive up to like Milpitas or Fremont or Pleasanton to like check out all the new dessert places and like the new restaurants. So it's just funny for you to say that. Crystal's making a face right now.
[00:09:39.400] That's so like funny because we always joke that East Bay, there's like nothing to do. The joke is Fremont never sleeps. And it's like become kind of a meme. But it's it's ironic because like there's literally nothing to do in Fremont. So everyone always sleeps here. Fremont is asleep. But I will say, though, that like Oakland for sure has like ton of culture.
[00:10:06.740] So there's definitely a lot of things happening up there. And I think it's just less techy, maybe. Sometimes it feels like Oakland has its own little subculture. Like they're not as affected by the Silicon Valley tech culture. And there's a lot of just diversity there and like cool things happening. But I don't know. I can't say for sure, because to be honest, I don't spend a ton of time in Oakland. I just stay home all day. No, I totally agree.
[00:10:34.700] And I was talking to some of my coworkers recently, and some of them have grown up locally. And then others have recently moved here or something. I guess because I mostly stay on like South Bay, a little bit of Peninsula now that I live here, but not so much when I was younger. And like from time to time SF, but not a ton, honestly. They were just like saying all these things about like, oh, like North Bay, like Marin has this. And then saying things like, oh, Berkeley has this and Emeryville has this.
[00:11:03.400] And I was kind of like, I have no idea about any of these places because I'm only ever in like two or three cities max, you know? And it especially got bad because I took the BART to work yesterday. I got lost on the way there and I got lost on the way home, which is crazy considering that from like my starting point to like my destination and like back, there's only like two trains. So it's like 50-50 chance. And both times I got the wrong end of the stick.
[00:11:31.480] So that just shows that, you know, I felt like I had a kind of insulated childhood, even though I was in the Bay, like I don't fully know the entire Bay Area. Yeah, I can agree. Like I probably am pretty similar since you brought up Berkeley. That's definitely also a pretty like lively and bustling city in East Bay, especially because it's a college town. I feel like there's a good amount of things to do and good amount of people always around there.
[00:12:01.480] But like Southeast Bay is very suburb-y. Like Fremont is super suburb-y. Like literally, we used to have a bowling alley in this city and people always joked like, oh my god, that's like the only late night activity in Fremont, like all of Fremont. They actually tore it down in the past five years or so to build more condos. Wait, that's so sad. It's like a piece of your memories.
[00:12:28.560] Yeah, and it was like a very long-standing bowling alley too. So a lot of people were pretty sad. But, you know, just suburb life out, like suburb life on like 200% out here. Wait, no, I know exactly what you mean though. Because when I think back to life in Cupertino, there's like a couple places that people hang out. So one, Cupertino Library, that was like the place to go if you are cool.
[00:12:54.380] So after school, I guess I shouldn't say cool people, but people who wanted to like study and socialize at the same time would all go there and hang out. And then there was like a teen section of the library that everyone would go to. And that's when you would see people from different high schools. And that was kind of like our social life. Which looking back, that is just so hilarious and iconic. Just like the library, you know? That's so nerdy. I'm sorry. Okay, but I have a cooler one.
[00:13:22.940] So the other place that you could hang out and like run into everyone there was this boba shop. So this boba shop was across from our high school, but I think a lot of people knew about it. So people from neighboring high schools would always come and like visit. And there you could always see like a bunch of friend groups, people hanging out. Sometimes people would even be like, oh, like we're here, come through. And then like everyone would kind of flock over. So those were probably our two like social hubs.
[00:13:52.940] I'm trying to think what ours were. I think like when we were younger, before we could drive, there was this Taco Bell that was really close to my school. And a lot of kids like passed by it on their way, like walking home or I don't know, going to like a tutoring session or whatever. So that was like a very popular spot. You would see a lot of people there after school getting super cheap, you know, Taco Bell tacos or like burritos or whatever.
[00:14:20.580] And in that same plaza, there's like a boba shop. It was like a Tapex. And so a lot of people would hang out there too. Those are like some of the iconic spots way back in the day. But that Taco Bell went out of business, I guess. Oh my gosh. It's just an empty building. I'm not super sure if the boba shop is still there either. Oh my God. Why is like every important landmark from your childhood just gone?
[00:14:51.400] I don't know. I guess to be fair, we had this place called Valco, which was like a little shopping mall, which was also pretty iconic. And we would always run there kind of like what you were saying, like pre everyone having a driver's license. That was like the closest food place or one of the closest ones. So we would fucking sprint there during lunch, get our food, sprint back. But they completely demolished the entire mall. So now there's like nothing in it anymore. Or it's just an empty space basically.
[00:15:21.300] Wait, I think I know that mall that you're talking about. It's just like it's like a ghost mall kind of. Yes. And you can go in, walk around in the unlocked areas. But it's just like there's nothing there. I think it was like that a couple years ago. But recently it's like an empty field. Oh, because they like buzzed down or like mowed down everything. Whoa. So it's a little crazy. It's kind of sad actually. Yeah. Like wasn't there, I think there used to be like a movie theater there.
[00:15:51.000] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. There was like an AMC. There was like a Victoria's Secret there. Even like a board game store slash like Manga or like, you know, you can get like playing cards there and stuff like that. Yeah. And photo booths. So I have a bunch of photo booth photos from when I was a sixth grader. Because we would always go there with my friends. But now it's just not there anymore. Dang. Wow. I'm surprised it went out of business. Right? That's pretty sad. It is.
[00:16:19.500] I will say for us growing up, Great Mall was a popular spot. It's like a little far because it's more Milpitas than like Fremont. It had like the movie theater and it had all the stores. As you remember, Fremont has like nothing.
[00:16:36.960] Actually, one of the really iconic moments I remember in, I think it was either early high school or late junior high, a movie theater opened in Fremont and we were all like so excited. It's the one in Pacific Commons. It's like a century theaters. And so we were like, oh my God, we don't have to like drive all the way to Milpitas anymore. Like we could just, we just go to Pacific Commons now. So I will admit Pacific Commons has like stuff that you can do in Fremont.
[00:17:06.960] They've like been really active about having new restaurants there and like dessert spots. But I don't know. I guess like we're just so used to complaining that there's nothing to do here that we don't even, we're just like, yeah, there's nothing to do. Where should we go? Not Pacific Commons. Let's go out of Fremont. Oh my God. I know. I feel like when I first started dating James and like being friends with you and some other Fremont people, you know, I would always think like, oh, maybe we should swap. So sometimes we hang out in Cupertino.
[00:17:37.020] Sometimes we hang out in Fremont when we're all back at home for summer vacation. But all the Fremont people would just be like, okay, we'll come to you. Like we'll always come to you in Cupertino. And I was like, you don't ever want to hang out in Fremont? They're like, no, like you guys are never down to hang out in Fremont, which I thought was so weird. I think we would just be like, yeah, like what would we do in Fremont? Like, please give us a suggestion. And I'm pretty sure if someone did give a suggestion, we'd just be like, no. Yeah.
[00:18:07.580] Exactly. Like, what if we went to Meat Fresh in Pacific Commons? We'd be like, no, there's a Meat Fresh in Cupertino. I think a lot of times we did go to that Meat Fresh in Cupertino. But what you said earlier kind of reminded me of, you know, before we had licenses, getting around was kind of one of the big things you had to solve for when trying to hang out with friends. And I remember usually one of the moms would like drive and pick us up.
[00:18:36.160] But one of the things that I remember is not every mom could drive as in like, you know, sometimes moms are working or they're not at home. And I don't know if this is unique to Korean moms or just, I guess, more recent immigrant moms or something like that. But some of the moms of my friends weren't super comfortable like driving in general, especially like highway stuff. If we were trying to go somewhere far, they would be kind of hesitant to do so.
[00:19:02.600] So I remember once my mom was like so tired of always being the only mom driving. And she was like, I'm not like a taxi driver. So sometimes maybe like your friend's mom should drive too. And I was like, oh. You're like, my bad for always volunteering you, mom. I know. And if I think about it at the time, I don't think I ever really like asked my friends as much of like, oh, can your mom drive this time?
[00:19:29.880] Like, I think I actually did probably volunteer my mom, which is like, you know, my mom's perspective. She's like, why does it always have to be me? But it's just so funny looking back at what a shithead kid I was kind of. Damn. No, I feel that though. I think like my mom tended to be more available as well because my dad sometimes would work a little later in the day. And so she would be like the one driving us around and stuff.
[00:19:58.000] But in terms of like hanging out, I think I would just be like, I can't hang out. Like, I can't hang out. No one can drive me. But I can hang out if like it's walkable. I think that's like in my memory what my default was a little more often. But there's definitely been times, of course, where like my mom has driven me or someone else's parents have picked me up.
[00:20:24.820] But I totally resonate with that mom's being scared on the road, I guess. I think because my mom actually didn't drive before we moved to America. And so once she was in America, she was like, oh, it makes sense if I learn to drive. It would be ideal for the family and just make things easier. So she had to like learn to drive. And at that time, she's what, like probably near 40 or so.
[00:20:53.660] Like learning to drive for the first time and like, you know, spending the time to become comfortable on the road. And everything. So my mom also only really drove nearby, like small distances. I guess it's something that we take for granted, like growing up in the U.S. where I think by like 15, I was like, I'm ready to drive, like throw me out there on the road. But in a lot of countries or maybe I guess even some cities, like it's not necessarily needed to drive. So that makes a lot of sense.
[00:21:22.300] Yeah, because in like in China, at least, taxis so available. So you can definitely get away with like not ever learning to drive, especially if you're in like a pretty populous city. Yeah, I guess if like public transportation too is good, like subwaying or trains from city to city even, you're pretty much set. Yeah.
[00:21:41.700] But I think one of the things that I'm recalling now is there's also kind of like a different culture or like vibe that you get with each mom who's driving. So I remember once my friend's mom actually volunteered to drive us. She had picked us up from school and like was taking us back or something. I think my mom had some errands to run. And then she was like, oh, do you guys want to stop by McDonald's? And I was like floored because we never went to McDonald's.
[00:22:10.140] I think the only fast food place we really ate was like KFC. I think I remember being like, oh, isn't McDonald's kind of unhealthy? And then she was like, oh, you can just get like a chicken wrap. And then I had the chicken wrap. I think it used to be called like a snack wrap or something. And my mind was fucking blown because it was so good. I was like, whoa, other families like just stop by McDonald's on the way home. You know what I mean? Oh, my God. Wow. That's crazy.
[00:22:39.680] Maybe your parents were like, yo, KFC, Korean fried chicken. They're like, this is my culture. My family is actually a big McDonald's fan because it was also in Canada. So when we were growing up, sometimes we would just be like, fuck it, dude. Let's just get McDonald's. It's like so cheap. And my dad loves the Big Mac. And like, you know, kids meal with the toys and everything. Right.
[00:23:09.320] And I think also just one of the biggest things was that it's just so cheap. I mean, nowadays it's more expensive, but still like in terms of relativity, it's still pretty cheap. Okay. Actually, since you spent a little more time growing up in California than I did, do you feel like In-N-Out was a big thing for your family because it's so like cheap and readily available? Yeah, it definitely was. But the way my family approached like fast food was really specific. I have a couple of theories.
[00:23:36.880] So like one, my mom didn't work for like a decent chunk of my childhood. She did when I was older, but definitely when I was younger, she didn't work. And also, I'm an only child. So I feel like maybe you have the urge more to be like, okay, let's just stop by McDonald's and like shut these kids up with like fast food or something if there's two kids crying in the back. But if it's just one, you know, maybe it's more manageable. That's a good point. I can totally see the logic there.
[00:24:06.540] But back to In-N-Out, we did get it, but we only really got it when we went to Gilroy shopping outlets to shop. And then the In-N-Out and Cupertino isn't very good. Like the Gilroy one is fucking fire, like on the same level as the Kettleman City In-N-Out. But the Cupertino one is like eh. So we just didn't go to the local one as much. I see. I see. I actually don't know if I've ever taken my parents to In-N-Out now that I'm thinking about it. Oh my God.
[00:24:36.480] I think I will have to make sure to do that sometime this year. Yeah, that's like California culture right there. Yeah. Because like now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure. Like maybe my dad's eaten it with like coworkers or something, but I'm not sure if my mom has ever had it. Okay, I'll be sure to like make them eat it sometime. But yeah, I feel like that's like a suburb thing kind of maybe.
[00:25:03.750] Maybe even if it's just fast food, it's like, oh my God, we're like eating out versus I imagine like in the city, there's just so much more food options available for you if you're like looking to eat out. I feel like in the suburbs, it's like, okay, I guess like we can look really hard to find something that's enticing or we could just drop by McDonald's. Yeah, that's true.
[00:25:28.450] I think when we all did start to have licenses, I don't know how relevant this was for you, but there's just like nothing you can do in Cupertino really. It's literally like that boba shop and the library and like this other coffee shop that people would go to. So the other alternative is to go to like random plazas or like random restaurants or whatever, like Taco Bell sometimes and just like sit there. And I feel like looking back, it's kind of like loitering, but I think that's just what high school kids do.
[00:25:56.910] And I don't know why, but back in high school, I feel like you could go to any restaurant and you would see people you know. Do you know what I'm talking about? I think for sure, especially because it's like you're going to school with these people. So, you know, you're all within like a certain vicinity of each other. And then there's just like certain hotspots in the area. For Fremont, one of the big hotspots back in the day was Sweet Tomatoes before it closed down. I think I've seen like families eat there quite a few times.
[00:26:26.730] Oh, interesting. I think for us, it was probably more like the key boba shops and stuff. And more and more boba shops opened up, but usually I think of it almost as like plazas. Like the plaza where Marukai was, I would always see people there. And the reason I even brought it up was like this was probably one of the college breaks that I came back home. But I just remember my friends and I went to In-N-Out and I was like, oh, hope we don't bump into anyone at In-N-Out.
[00:26:55.450] And then we literally saw like a bunch of people we knew just like there for different reasons. Like someone behind the counter was someone we knew. My ex was there. I literally was like, what the fuck? Like this is why I hate coming back home because everyone everywhere is like someone you know or like a friend of a friend. Oh, that's so true. Right? Your In-N-Out story. I'm pretty sure I've had something very similar to that. Like we walk into In-N-Out at like 10 p.m. for some reason, only people you know are in In-N-Out.
[00:27:26.810] Oh, my God. I think like there are times where it's like kind of cool and you're like, oh, shit, it's been so long. And then there are other times where you're like, the last thing I want to happen today is like to run into these random people I have to make shitty small talk with. And it's always like the second type of day where things like this actually happens to you.
[00:27:44.850] I feel like this stuff happened a lot more during like college years when everyone was back visiting, like you said, or during like high school when more and more people were starting to get their licenses. Yeah, that's true. I guess because back then it was kind of like cool to go out. I feel like people made more of a point to like go out and like hang out. And plus, you only have so much time to like see your hometown friends back home.
[00:28:12.390] So maybe that's why it was so common. But it does make me feel a little bit old now when I go to plazas where I used to be like, oh, my God, I'm going to see someone I know. And then I'm like looking around and I don't see a single familiar face. I'm like, I'm old and irrelevant now. Although I will admit that it still happens, but just like maybe less so out and about. It's more like at events or gatherings that I feel like these bump ins occur more often now.
[00:28:42.470] And I guess it's kind of like a thing about just living in. I mean, we say that like it's pretty Bay Area specific sometimes that like everyone knows everyone or like everyone knows someone who knows someone. But maybe it's also just like a small town kind of thing. I don't know if our cities count as small towns, though, but it's sometimes it really feels like it. That's true.
[00:29:08.630] It does feel like in our childhood it was more of a small town and now it feels bigger. I don't know if maybe we just know more of the world now or something. But, you know, I do feel like there's been a lot more development and stuff that makes the city slightly different when you look at it now. I don't know how much you feel this way about Fremont. But Cupertino definitely in the last 10 years has changed a lot. Some parts of it I don't even recognize anymore. And it's even like the roads.
[00:29:35.050] Like, you know, when you're younger, you always go on the same roads with your parents so you know exactly what each street looks like. I feel like I just don't have that same sense of familiarity anymore. And it makes me a little bit sad.
[00:30:15.070] Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.
[00:30:46.770] Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.
[00:31:18.290] Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Aw.
[00:31:46.530] including food, transportation, all of that? No. I don't know that book. Shoot, I can't remember. It's giving me what the title was, but I guess in some ways the cities that you mentioned are sort of like that where there are times where I'm talking to someone who works in tech and there's things in my life that I have to do and pay for. For example, I have to drive to work or I have to pay for the Caltrain. I have to buy my lunch. On some days I don't anymore,
[00:32:11.930] but usually I have to buy my lunch and then I have to go home and I have to cook dinner and then I have to go to the gym and then pay for the gym. But you talk to a tech worker and they're like, oh yeah, I just take the company bus to work and then on it there's free Wi-Fi and then I use a free company gym or I get a stipend for a gym and then I eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then have
[00:32:37.250] a little take-home dessert at work. And I'm just like, what the fuck? Your life is not real. You know what I mean? You're like, be fucking for real. Yeah, BFFR. Yeah, it's really something. And before I heard about how it was affecting the city's economy and stuff, I didn't think much about it. I was just like, oh my god, that sounds awesome.
[00:33:00.770] Like, people can just go to work, eat at work, and save so much money. But then now I'm like, oh, okay, there are definitely downsides to it as well. It's hard on the city sometimes. But I guess also it's good for the city in other ways. So for example, Sunnyvale, it used to be a city of nothing when we were younger. Low-key, there's just nothing there.
[00:33:25.070] There's no schools there. So they didn't have a ton of property value either. But lately, because of the whole tech culture and startups and things like that, a lot of companies started moving into Sunnyvale. And now Sunnyvale is much more developed than it was before. There's a lot more offices there. A lot more people want to live there because it's close to work. And because
[00:33:50.230] there's people who are living there, new buildings, condos or townhomes, all that kind of stuff are being built. So I guess there's the pros and cons of having such huge companies take over such large portions of the bay. Yeah, that's true. It really does do something funny to the house prices and the values and stuff. I remember for a while, people were freaking out during the pandemic because with
[00:34:19.970] remote work and no kind of like return to office date set at the time, people were freaking out about, oh, what's it going to do to the housing market? And now I think it's more settled with RTO and such. But the other interesting aspect of a city being completely dominated by like a company is I do feel like certain companies try a little harder to like uplift the community around them. The city that I currently live in, it's not necessarily as iconic of like, oh, this company owns the city, but it's kind
[00:34:49.770] of close to one of those cities. And Meta will constantly throw like community events in our neighborhood park. And it's like all throughout summer and it's pretty big events. They'll get a lot of local vendors and stuff to come. So people do get pretty excited for it. And I think it's cool. We're at a time where if we wanted to, like no one would ever have to leave the house ever and everyone would be forever entertained. But you know, throwing small things like that does get a community to kind
[00:35:17.830] of join together and like have fun and enjoy their summers. So I guess that's one of the benefits of corporate gentrification. Yeah. Wait, that's cool. I never knew that they did stuff like that. So anyone can go to those events. Yeah. Oh my God. Could you imagine they're like, show your badge and then you could enter. They're like free beer only if you show your employee badge.
[00:35:43.790] Yeah, exactly. I guess like another thing kind of going back to our youth growing up in the Bay. And I think it's still like kind of applicable now is the fact that we do have like a city that people will commute up to and like make trips to. And we call it the city too. So it's like SF. I think that's also really funny because one time I think I was talking to my friend and I was saying
[00:36:11.630] like, oh yeah, I was like in the city the other day and they're like, oh wait, do you mean SF or New York? And I was like, dude, New York, obviously. What are you talking about? But then I was like, that's right. We call SF the city here in the Bay Area. Right. Dude, I remember like I had to teach myself how to do that because in Korean, like my parents always say, oh, like we're going to go to San Fran, which I guess in the English way, it's like San Fran. So I thought everyone said that. And
[00:36:41.630] then I remember once I saw online or something, it was like real Bay Area people know that you never say San Fran. It's SF or the city. And then I was like, fuck. So I had to train like, oh yeah, I'm going into the city. You know? Yeah. When we did internships, like how we talked about last episode, it'd be like, oh yeah, I'm interning up in the city this summer. Right. Like people would say things like that. Right. I think that's also a pretty unique thing in general, though. Like the
[00:37:09.570] fact that we have a bigger city pretty close to us that we can commute to and like take trips to, especially like growing up. I don't know about you, but I would take BART up to SF. And if I did, it was like a big thing, you know, like, wow, like if we're going to go all the way up to SF, like we better be spending a whole last day up there. And so like we would make plans and,
[00:37:34.310] you know, get a bunch of friends. We'd go take the BART early-ish in the morning and then we like BART back after dinner or something like that. Oh my God. I totally have memories like that too. But we were on the other side of the bay. So we took the Caltrain up and I remember it's slightly more annoying with Caltrain because I think BART has way more frequent trains. If I remember like some
[00:37:58.690] trains don't stop at every stop and Caltrain has like bullet trains too, but it's not always as common and there's not really any bullet trains on the weekend, if I remember correctly. So basically when we went up to SF, the last like stop on Caltrain is basically a mission bay. So to go into like actual, like, I guess what you would call like the city near Civic Center or like where all the famous
[00:38:22.730] restaurants are and stuff, you still have to like, I don't know, like walk in or like take an Uber or something. And back then Uber wasn't as big of a thing. So I just remember it was like really fucking annoying to get around. One of the days that we went in, it was a weekday, but we just had that day off. So we like did our thing and then we were Caltrain back, but it was at like 5 p.m.
[00:38:46.250] So we took the train back with like all these tired, like tech workers. It was a full train. And I think like some of us had to stand and stuff. And I just remember being like, oh, it's so lame that Caltrain is so quiet and like, we can't even talk because no one talks on the train. Right. Yeah. But now looking back, I'm like, oh God, I hope we did not talk and like cause a scene on the Caltrain. Did you guys ever go up to SF as part of a school trip?
[00:39:15.870] I think we did for one of our dances, probably like senior prom or something. Okay. And then we did ones for the natural history museum or whatever that one is called. Yeah, I don't know. Oh, is it the exploratorium? Oh shit. It might be, it also might be the California Academy of Science. Oh, okay. We don't know our museums.
[00:39:42.060] Yeah, I think I went up to SF maybe once or twice for like an actual school trip, which was now that I'm thinking back on it, I think we actually like met up at BART and we all like got into groups, assigned groups, and we BARTed up together and like we BARTed back down together. Kind of crazy, right? Like just thinking about parents letting their children loose and like going up on this train to the city with friends.
[00:40:11.180] At least with school, it's like, okay, well, there's going to be chaperones. But like sometimes we would just go like with friends, right? On the weekend or something. And like, how did our parents let us do that? We probably felt like, oh yeah, I'm old enough. Like I can do this now. Considering we were living in the suburb, I feel like that's a lot different. Like what parents are exposed to and like what kids are exposed to versus say like someone who grew up in like Chicago or
[00:40:36.520] like New York, like in the city. But here it's just like, oh, okay, I guess I'll just let my child run free and go up to the city and I won't be there. Yeah, no, I think when you grow up in the suburbs, you definitely have a little bit less like street smarts. But like how often were you guys going into the city? Because I feel like for us, it was like under, at least for me, I don't think I went up there more than like five times. And every single
[00:41:05.800] time I would like have to hype myself up because I'm a suburbs girly, you know, I'm like, yeah, the city's so dangerous. Like gotta be careful tomorrow. I think similar, probably less than five times, at least in high school, probably in college started getting more common just because, you know, maybe more people had more experience with SF since they might have interned there or just like, we're older now. So we'd like drive up or whatever.
[00:41:33.780] Yeah, honestly, it wasn't that much. It was definitely like a big event if we were going to go up to the city, spend like a day there. I just remember anytime I went up to the city, my mom would be like absolutely fucking distraught, so worried. She's like, SF is going to be freezing, like wear a parka. I'm like, mom, it's like summer. And you know, it's like when you go into SF, I feel like you have to take pictures, at least in high school, because it's like cool to have gone up.
[00:42:02.200] So I would always try to wear like my cutest fits. And I can't be fucking cute when I'm wearing like a parka, right? So I just remember like going back and forth with my mom and eventually like bringing one but like leaving it on the ground or something for a fuck. Dude, now that I think about it, my mom was probably similar because my mom's a bit more like of a warrior. But then like when I interned in SF, I think like they didn't give a fuck. Like my parents
[00:42:32.200] work and have fun, peace out. I'm like, what happened to all of that worry just like a couple years ago? I guess you would have been mostly indoors versus just like outside. I guess that's fair. I'm like not running around as much. But sometimes I would stay in the city for like dinner with friends who are also interning or with like co-workers sometimes. Huh. They're like,
[00:42:56.580] you're making your own money. Bye. Off the roster of things I need to worry about. They're like, oh, you're still here? Well, this is so funny kind of looking back. I do think that it still rings true that the Bay Area has changed a decent amount. But now that we're really talking about our childhood experiences, especially with San Francisco, I feel like we're the ones who changed and we're the ones who kind of
[00:43:25.480] have maybe a slightly, hopefully slightly bigger worldview to be able to notice different things. So thank you for taking a trip down memory lane with me, Crystal.
