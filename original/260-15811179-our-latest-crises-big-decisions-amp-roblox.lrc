[00:00:00.000] [SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal.
[00:00:16.040] [SPEAKER_02]: This week we have a Gen Z word to talk about. Actually, I don't even know if this is Gen Z. This might be like a
[00:00:22.360] [SPEAKER_02]: millennial word. I think it's HelloFunny and the origin of this word is from Twitch and or the gaming community.
[00:00:30.720] [SPEAKER_02]: I would say like probably Twitch because of the emotesense stuff. The word is copium and it's a combination
[00:00:38.860] [SPEAKER_02]: of the word cop and opium. So you could kind of understand it's basically implying that you're holding
[00:00:49.860] [SPEAKER_02]: on to like coping mechanisms or like hope mechanisms as if it's an addiction like opium.
[00:00:57.740] [SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this word on urban dictionary, the definitions are quite funny. I mean one is like a
[00:01:03.980] [SPEAKER_00]: very simplistic one like you said lying to yourself in order to cope with something but this other
[00:01:09.100] [SPEAKER_00]: one it literally calls copium a metaphorical opiate inhaled when faced with loss failure or defeat.
[00:01:15.980] [SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, that's the perfect way to describe it. It's also really funny because there is
[00:01:26.040] [SPEAKER_02]: an alternative variation of this word which is just hopium instead of copium. Oh,
[00:01:31.980] [SPEAKER_00]: but they're like pretty much the same thing. I've also heard this shortened well I guess it's not
[00:01:38.060] [SPEAKER_00]: really shortened but a lot of times we'll just say cop instead of copium to sort of reference copium
[00:01:45.000] [SPEAKER_00]: but also I guess it literally just is the word cop as well. This word is also so funny as is most
[00:01:52.740] [SPEAKER_02]: twitch words because it has an embo attached to it. Oh my god. And so the copium meme is like
[00:01:59.340] [SPEAKER_02]: pretty funny because it's that like pepefrog which is the icon of twitch and he just has this like
[00:02:06.160] [SPEAKER_02]: gas mask on and instead of it being linked to oxygen, it's linked to a tank that says copium.
[00:02:15.000] [SPEAKER_00]: I think his eyes are closer something too. So yeah, I mean, I think the copium. But this one is
[00:02:21.000] [SPEAKER_00]: a really, really applicable word I think. Anytime there's any sort of competition you're doing
[00:02:26.360] [SPEAKER_00]: with your friends, some sort of game or even something as simple as someone's favorite sports team
[00:02:31.560] [SPEAKER_00]: losing in a game that week, it's just such an easy word to pull out and be like copium. So true
[00:02:37.480] [SPEAKER_02]: and if anyone's ever trying to rationalize something or explain themselves, you can just slap
[00:02:43.820] [SPEAKER_02]: on copium. You're coping. No need to explain further and it always guarantees laughs.
[00:02:50.520] [SPEAKER_02]: A pretty good application of this is I watch like the pro valiant attorneys. There's this one
[00:02:56.820] [SPEAKER_02]: team that's like super super popular called Sentinels and then oftentimes they kind of, you know,
[00:03:03.360] [SPEAKER_02]: maybe lose out early or something of that sort and then people are always like okay in order
[00:03:08.700] [SPEAKER_02]: for Sentinels to make it to play offs or regionals or whatever, they have to like win these next
[00:03:15.420] [SPEAKER_02]: games by X amount of rounds. These other teams need to lose by like this amount of rounds.
[00:03:21.300] [SPEAKER_02]: Everything needs to fall into line and then everyone's always like do major copium.
[00:03:27.540] [SPEAKER_00]: My family that's like copium almost. Oh true true. Or the funny ones too are like when
[00:03:34.580] [SPEAKER_00]: someone loses and they're like you know what I didn't even want to win this anyway. Like if I
[00:03:38.920] [SPEAKER_00]: won this I would have had to do this or like we totally would have won this if LeBron wasn't out
[00:03:44.020] [SPEAKER_00]: sick this day or something and everyone's just like dude that's hard copium. You have to go a
[00:03:49.000] [SPEAKER_02]: grade copium. Once you understand copium it's just so easy to like utilize it in your day today.
[00:03:57.120] [SPEAKER_00]: There is. And always envision the pepe. Hopping. Hopping copium. It's so funny.
[00:04:05.080] [SPEAKER_02]: Well one way that I personally use copium a lot is when I go through my life crises.
[00:04:12.800] [SPEAKER_00]: Well let's get into it. What has been your latest crisis? Dude I feel like I say this every time
[00:04:18.780] [SPEAKER_02]: but my crisis is always what do I do with my life? Okay I think it's because we're around that time you know
[00:04:28.170] [SPEAKER_02]: quarter life crises. We're like figuring out the next steps in our lives. Big transitions and changes
[00:04:35.750] [SPEAKER_02]: are upon us. lately things that I've been thinking about a lot is big decisions in life. Like
[00:04:43.170] [SPEAKER_02]: marriage, having kids, freezing your eggs, all of these kinds of things. It's especially relevant now
[00:04:49.510] [SPEAKER_02]: because we as women are hitting the age where you really start to consider like oh my god I am
[00:04:55.390] [SPEAKER_02]: almost 30 what does this mean for my health and ability for having children and yeah it's so
[00:05:02.250] [SPEAKER_02]: fucked up because I think what after 34 or something you're literally labeled as geriatric pregnancy
[00:05:08.750] [SPEAKER_02]: if you get pregnant. I feel like the undeniable biological clock is kind of catching up to us.
[00:05:17.110] [SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a lot to think about. I'm like whoa how do you know if you want to have kids?
[00:05:21.970] [SPEAKER_02]: How do you know if you're ready for marriage or if you're ready for you know huge responsibilities
[00:05:29.330] [SPEAKER_02]: that other people are involved in? And I think it's like sometimes especially,
[00:05:36.470] [SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I guess like confusing or jarring for me because I'm very used to being
[00:05:42.950] [SPEAKER_02]: very confident in my choices. I'm usually very like oh yeah 100% I will do this like right
[00:05:50.350] [SPEAKER_02]: but then now these like huge decisions I'm like oh my god I don't know and this is like one of
[00:05:55.570] [SPEAKER_02]: the few times where I truly don't know and it's such a big impactful decision.
[00:06:01.890] [SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's also just so much pressure because I don't know in some ways I feel like men
[00:06:07.670] [SPEAKER_00]: are almost allowed to age and like embrace each year for what it is but as women there's so
[00:06:14.990] [SPEAKER_00]: emphasis placed on like our youth and the younger you are like you know people cat call you more
[00:06:20.690] [SPEAKER_00]: and everyone's like oh my god there's this deadline of being 30 like are you gonna get married
[00:06:25.430] [SPEAKER_00]: or you're gonna do this for all of the all before that so then I feel like age is almost
[00:06:30.770] [SPEAKER_00]: inflicted on us or like this pace of time is inflicted on us whereas men are just like oh another year
[00:06:36.490] [SPEAKER_02]: like another birthday yeah that's so good true and I feel like it's always about how the
[00:06:45.610] [SPEAKER_02]: women's body is being affected with age you know for example like the eggs in our ovaries are
[00:06:52.750] [SPEAKER_02]: less prime i guess so when we get older but how come there's no talk about like sperm dying
[00:07:01.750] [SPEAKER_00]: dude it's cuz that sperm is like perpetual motion like it just keeps getting great
[00:07:07.870] [SPEAKER_02]: oh shit you're right you're right that's constant production but like our eggs are just
[00:07:13.870] [SPEAKER_02]: the total amount eggs we have exist when we're born right yeah i think something like that
[00:07:20.110] [SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know it's like not even just about the reproductive system i feel like I was pretty young
[00:07:25.590] [SPEAKER_00]: when i started thinking about anti-aging stuff and i don't know it's like we're not even 30 yet
[00:07:32.950] [SPEAKER_00]: not that 30 is some magic number but I feel like we're still fairly young and i'm always like
[00:07:37.950] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god like i need to put on sunscreen and do this and that to like prevent aging
[00:07:42.290] [SPEAKER_00]: whereas i don't think that takes up even like 1% of my husband's brain you know like there's no
[00:07:48.630] [SPEAKER_02]: ways to give out as much as like i do it's like those memes where it's like my boyfriend slash
[00:07:54.170] [SPEAKER_02]: husband just like splashes water on his face and his skin is so clear i'm like meanwhile
[00:07:59.890] [SPEAKER_02]: the girls are like baskets and like shelves of skincare and they're like why am i still breaking
[00:08:06.610] [SPEAKER_00]: out? I know it's like my 40 minute nighttime routine versus like the 6 and 1 shampoo cleanser
[00:08:14.010] [SPEAKER_02]: funny but about that i saw a funny thing recently i never looked into this to determine how true
[00:08:22.780] [SPEAKER_02]: this is but i saw something that was like women need more sleep than men because they use their
[00:08:29.120] [SPEAKER_02]: brains more and i was like down that's probably the root of all our problems like me just
[00:08:37.450] [SPEAKER_02]: to stop using our brains i wish you could pause it i'm not kind of stand up to me as you talk
[00:08:44.590] [SPEAKER_00]: through this crisis is you said you usually feel very confident in your decisions and i feel like
[00:08:50.170] [SPEAKER_00]: i have also seen that as your friend but now you're kind of feeling unsure about it
[00:08:55.410] [SPEAKER_02]: what do you think that stems from dude i don't know i think part of it might be that
[00:09:03.430] [SPEAKER_02]: these decisions involve other people like in a much bigger degree than my normal decisions
[00:09:10.030] [SPEAKER_02]: you know normal data data decisions are pretty focused on yourself and probably don't have too
[00:09:15.870] [SPEAKER_02]: much of a lasting impact on the people around you it's not like you're making decisions
[00:09:22.030] [SPEAKER_02]: that will bring someone along for the rest of your life which is pretty much what marriages right
[00:09:27.690] [SPEAKER_02]: that's true and having kids i will literally bring a living being into this world and
[00:09:34.510] [SPEAKER_02]: basically have responsibility over them for the rest of my life and then marriages you know kind of
[00:09:45.490] [SPEAKER_02]: the rest of our lives and just it's like a 50-50 decision in terms of responsibility i'm like whoa
[00:09:53.370] [SPEAKER_00]: that's crazy do you think it feels crazy in a foreign way but still exciting or crazy and
[00:10:01.710] [SPEAKER_00]: like a i am just frozen because i don't know or to do kind of way i think it's like a bit of
[00:10:08.830] [SPEAKER_02]: frozenness i think i have a personal opinion a little bit on these decisions but then there's always
[00:10:14.430] [SPEAKER_02]: the fear of like oh what if this becomes something i regret or something that not just i regret but
[00:10:21.890] [SPEAKER_02]: like other people also regret or are negatively affected by i don't know maybe it's also just
[00:10:29.230] [SPEAKER_00]: because as we get older the gravity of these decisions also get bigger it's like when you're younger
[00:10:36.290] [SPEAKER_00]: your single or maybe you might be in a relationship but like you want to move somewhere there's
[00:10:41.030] [SPEAKER_00]: a reversibility in that but like you said there's like so much permanence and like wait and like
[00:10:47.010] [SPEAKER_00]: i don't know seriousness associated with bigger life decisions that happen around this age
[00:10:51.850] [SPEAKER_00]: so i can see why it could be freezing for sick and a lot of the right word but you don't
[00:10:57.590] [SPEAKER_02]: I mean thank you for us yeah because also i think say for example like marriage and kids you can
[00:11:05.130] [SPEAKER_02]: make a decision that is easily reversible but those are the decisions of doing nothing like you
[00:11:12.030] [SPEAKER_02]: know not getting married not having kids those are easily reversible sides of this decision
[00:11:17.730] [SPEAKER_02]: but the other side is like much less reversible if true you're married then you would have to go
[00:11:23.750] [SPEAKER_02]: through a whole divorce process and all of that and if you have kids like you can't really
[00:11:29.210] [SPEAKER_00]: reverse that yeah and i think it directly contradicts what we were talking about earlier
[00:11:34.790] [SPEAKER_00]: of like oh there's all this emphasis on like you have to do things quickly like do things before
[00:11:39.390] [SPEAKER_00]: certain time well what if i want to take my time and noodle on these things before
[00:11:44.630] [SPEAKER_00]: impossibly choosing like yes or no and then just being stuck with it for like all eternity
[00:11:51.150] [SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's pretty wavy and i'm like dude we're just like we're just like children how can we
[00:11:57.310] [SPEAKER_00]: be making these decisions? yeah and i think the hardest thing too is the involvement of
[00:12:03.390] [SPEAKER_00]: other people like you said mm-hmm everyone has timelines and it's not even always just like
[00:12:08.690] [SPEAKER_00]: you and your partners like your family your friends people around you they all have timelines
[00:12:14.250] [SPEAKER_00]: and i feel like between you and your partner coordinating that is already kind of difficult not
[00:12:19.410] [SPEAKER_00]: difficult but it's not like the easiest conversation in the world but then adding in everyone else
[00:12:24.390] [SPEAKER_02]: is what truly makes it torture sometimes dude and i think another aspect of these decisions for
[00:12:32.950] [SPEAKER_02]: personally i think about it and like is this what i want? is this the life i want to work towards
[00:12:42.110] [SPEAKER_02]: i think it would be easier if i knew for sure personally like oh i really want to have kids
[00:12:47.650] [SPEAKER_02]: or that kind of stuff but i think right now my personal opinion is do i want to have kids like maybe
[00:12:53.830] [SPEAKER_02]: not i don't know that like unsureness also just seeps into the rest of the whole like decision
[00:13:02.270] [SPEAKER_02]: and of course it's like i wouldn't want someone else to make the decision for me in the sense
[00:13:07.730] [SPEAKER_02]: where it's like your partner wants to have kids and then you're like i don't know and then you're
[00:13:12.610] [SPEAKER_02]: like well since i'm unsure we'll just do it then like it doesn't really feel right i guess
[00:13:18.110] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah that's true i think it's also just hearted in vision me right now as a 28 year old i have
[00:13:24.910] [SPEAKER_00]: things that i want and don't want right but as a 40 year old am i gonna want or not want the same
[00:13:31.050] [SPEAKER_00]: things like what about when i'm 50 60 et cetera so i always like think about that too i'm
[00:13:36.770] [SPEAKER_00]: like who am i gonna be 20 years from now 30 years from now like what is my life gonna be in my
[00:13:41.370] [SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle too yeah so i think i'm just in a big like what is my next step you know like what
[00:13:47.970] [SPEAKER_02]: is 30 year old crystal want and like what do i need to do to reach that in the next couple years
[00:13:54.950] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god five year plan oh no no couple years
[00:14:03.590] [SPEAKER_02]: i can i i would never be able to plan so far but i thought it was also funny that i'm
[00:14:11.310] [SPEAKER_02]: having this crisis because in my mind i'm like dude i feel like i'm having a midlife crisis and
[00:14:16.730] [SPEAKER_02]: whenever i tell people that they're like um i don't think you're quite there yet like i'm in
[00:14:24.370] [SPEAKER_02]: doing things that people with midlife crisis do i think about making big purchases so that i have
[00:14:31.610] [SPEAKER_02]: control over my life i literally was like looking at new cars when i have like no reason to buy
[00:14:37.830] [SPEAKER_02]: a new car and i was like oh my god like what would be a fun car to own like oh my god like a convertible
[00:14:44.090] [SPEAKER_02]: car all of that kind of stuff and i was like wait i literally sound like a middle-aged man
[00:14:50.160] [SPEAKER_02]: trying to like find the fun in life again or something maybe it's like the ghost of your
[00:14:56.100] [SPEAKER_00]: middle-aged self trying to come out maybe you should do like a say on so try to talk to it
[00:15:01.300] [SPEAKER_02]: i feel like what do you want right but i do think on the other side of that there are some
[00:15:07.900] [SPEAKER_02]: positive changes that i've been making i'm like oh my god like you know age is real i need to
[00:15:13.300] [SPEAKER_02]: healthier make hopefully small adjustments that eventually lead to bigger positive consequence
[00:15:22.060] [SPEAKER_00]: it really is the perfect time to do it i almost feel like you know people are always like oh there's
[00:15:27.060] [SPEAKER_00]: like shoulder seasons for travel so like a lot of people travel during summers or maybe you
[00:15:32.380] [SPEAKER_00]: want to travel during the shoulder season that might be like in between winter and spring or something
[00:15:36.640] [SPEAKER_00]: i feel like this age of 28 is like a shoulder season of life due where we're not quite in our
[00:15:43.140] [SPEAKER_00]: 30s but i'm just anticipating it so much that i might as well be fun 30 already i feel like oh
[00:15:49.780] [SPEAKER_02]: well i see a lot of people enter their 30s and then they they show much more confidence and like
[00:15:55.860] [SPEAKER_02]: contentment with what where they are i worry i'm like oh my god is this like true satisfaction
[00:16:02.460] [SPEAKER_02]: or did they just give up on life and was like well this is the best we're gonna get oh my god
[00:16:08.780] [SPEAKER_00]: i feel like do you i feel like 30s will be a slay i think the life that will live in our 30s
[00:16:14.720] [SPEAKER_00]: will be so fun but my problem is like how do we get there because there's like a gap right now
[00:16:21.260] [SPEAKER_02]: we're like how do we fast forward the next two years but yeah that's you know that's been my
[00:16:27.260] [SPEAKER_02]: crisis just another facet of what do i do with my life and what do you know what is this age
[00:16:34.740] [SPEAKER_02]: and what are these decisions how about you what have you been thinking about so for me i have
[00:16:42.340] [SPEAKER_00]: recently started a new job yeah and i am a couple weeks into it and it's been amazing i've been
[00:16:50.260] [SPEAKER_00]: loving the onboarding process the team the people the company everything but here's a problem
[00:16:57.540] [SPEAKER_00]: before this i had stayed at the same company for a long time i have also moved back to my
[00:17:05.200] [SPEAKER_00]: hometown post college so a lot of our college friends and high school friends are here and i feel
[00:17:11.540] [SPEAKER_00]: like just in general i haven't had to make new friends in like a completely new environment in a very
[00:17:17.580] [SPEAKER_00]: long time so i just don't i forgot how to make new friends and i feel like i'm like a funny
[00:17:24.020] [SPEAKER_00]: person like i feel like i have positive strength that i could bring yes to like a social situation
[00:17:29.780] [SPEAKER_00]: but i it's hard for me to get there for some reason and i was like doing some
[00:17:37.520] [SPEAKER_00]: analysis on like my social situation at work right now and i was like you know i feel like
[00:17:41.900] [SPEAKER_00]: my people talk to me i have stuff to say and i feel like it's kind of interesting or like funny
[00:17:46.620] [SPEAKER_00]: but it's like really hard for me to must up the courage to like start a new conversation with someone
[00:17:52.840] [SPEAKER_00]: and i was like that's a problem because you can't always rely on other people to like start the conversation
[00:17:58.300] [SPEAKER_00]: but it just gives me a lot of anxiety to open my mouth and have words to build a bit
[00:18:05.280] [SPEAKER_02]: unpromptured yeah so that's been what i'm going through that makes total sense and i think also
[00:18:10.460] [SPEAKER_02]: sometimes it's hard in the beginning because you don't know everyone's sense of humor yet so you're
[00:18:16.460] [SPEAKER_02]: oh are they gonna laugh or is it like inappropriate for work or all of that stuff but
[00:18:23.620] [SPEAKER_02]: jesus boy do i have a podcast for you beat your crust episode 188 making coworker friends
[00:18:32.700] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god honestly so true i listen to that we made that episode for future you
[00:18:40.570] [SPEAKER_00]: haha it's not as bad as i'm making it out to be like it's not like i'm eating lunch and a corner
[00:18:46.270] [SPEAKER_00]: crying every day i still eat with everyone and it's fine it's just i don't feel seen right now
[00:18:54.230] [SPEAKER_00]: and it once you are friends with people it's like they know who you are so if i say some sort of
[00:18:59.290] [SPEAKER_00]: joke they're like oh that's such a g-soo thing to like i want to get to that level and right now i
[00:19:09.410] [SPEAKER_00]: wish to my identity and the word place yet but you know i'm also very green it's literally been like a
[00:19:14.650] [SPEAKER_02]: couple weeks so i'm getting there yeah and i'm sure it's like a huge contrast because
[00:19:20.050] [SPEAKER_02]: you're literally coming from a place where people have known you for years to a brand new place where
[00:19:27.150] [SPEAKER_02]: you have to start over so it's kind of like oh it's not like before anymore yeah exactly i don't
[00:19:33.890] [SPEAKER_00]: i guess i just forgot how vulnerable it feels to want to be the person to make friends
[00:19:41.670] [SPEAKER_00]: because you know just the cold hard facts is like everyone at work has work friends already for the
[00:19:47.830] [SPEAKER_00]: most part so then i'm the one going in and i'm like hey guys i'm also really a big friend
[00:19:53.630] [SPEAKER_00]: but i have to be like fucking fessies with everyone you work with but you know i'm the one who
[00:19:59.630] [SPEAKER_00]: has more to gain you know so i should be the one who's more vulnerable maybe putting myself out there
[00:20:06.230] [SPEAKER_00]: asking if people want to grab snacks or like you know anything as simple as that but i'm just
[00:20:12.130] [SPEAKER_00]: slowly trying to ease into it and what's been helping me a little bit is the more i think about
[00:20:18.630] [SPEAKER_00]: it the worst it is if i'm like oh god like i should say something and like i should you know
[00:20:23.230] [SPEAKER_00]: ask them to get snack like i'm like i just won't do it but if i let my body move first like i just
[00:20:29.090] [SPEAKER_00]: put my mouth and like how the words come out then i feel like it's better yeah
[00:20:34.490] [SPEAKER_02]: has your team done any like bonding activity ever since you've joined?
[00:20:40.110] [SPEAKER_02]: no they haven't well hopefully they do soon once or more settled in well i guess we did
[00:20:45.650] [SPEAKER_02]: we like why don't i walk or something but it's like happy hour that's not the same yeah like you
[00:20:50.850] [SPEAKER_02]: need some happy hour or like a like a meal together that's like officially like team bonding you know
[00:20:58.570] [SPEAKER_00]: that is true actually the funny thing is the first week that i started coincidentally there was
[00:21:05.610] [SPEAKER_00]: like a big event for the company so it was like summer outing or whatever and then we all went
[00:21:12.110] [SPEAKER_00]: to this venue and then spent five hours there just like playing games and like eating lunch
[00:21:17.350] [SPEAKER_00]: and drinking and stuff like that i was a little bit nervous about it because these things when
[00:21:22.510] [SPEAKER_00]: your brand new could either be like oh you meet hell of people and it's great or you don't know
[00:21:27.970] [SPEAKER_00]: anyone so you don't meet anyone and it's like super awkward but yeah i felt like you know my
[00:21:33.430] [SPEAKER_00]: team members were introducing me to people which they also have been outside of the event
[00:21:37.890] [SPEAKER_00]: and i was also you know being like a question ball like oh where do you live how you're
[00:21:41.650] [SPEAKER_00]: like okay like you know just like trying to engage in conversation and i was a little bit
[00:21:46.850] [SPEAKER_00]: proud of myself nice me straight out of college i don't think i would have been able to handle this
[00:21:53.010] [SPEAKER_00]: but me now i have a little bit of social skills or something you're like where did these come from
[00:22:02.690] [SPEAKER_02]: like how am i talking right now that does some fun and i feel like that's nice that
[00:22:08.990] [SPEAKER_02]: it like coincidentally happened when you joined it's probably like a good warm up maybe
[00:22:13.910] [SPEAKER_00]: i think so and it did introduce me to like a couple people outside of my team so now i know
[00:22:20.570] [SPEAKER_00]: like i can say how do these people in the office and whatnot but yeah it just makes me feel
[00:22:24.790] [SPEAKER_00]: young again you know like i think i associate being vulnerable with feeling young as well so then
[00:22:31.170] [SPEAKER_00]: in some ways i go to work feeling like a kid going to school for the first time or something
[00:22:36.790] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god are you the youngest that work right now i think me and another cooker are probably
[00:22:41.490] [SPEAKER_00]: around similar age and i think us two are the youngest oh okay so maybe there's some like
[00:22:47.570] [SPEAKER_00]: debunking there yeah could be i'm trying to like incorporate personality into everything that i do you
[00:22:54.790] [SPEAKER_00]: know like let me write this note with personality we always talk about the dreaded like how is
[00:23:03.490] [SPEAKER_00]: your weekend like i always try to talk about stuff that people can like latch on to associate me with
[00:23:10.390] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah or like use as like a conversation starting point oh okay so other team members will be like
[00:23:16.050] [SPEAKER_00]: oh it's good i just like hung out with some friends and then i'm like i had a great week
[00:23:23.920] [SPEAKER_00]: here are all the things that i did this weekend guys let's talk about me
[00:23:31.200] [SPEAKER_02]: okay no but i think that's good for sure you're putting yourself out there other people who are like
[00:23:37.340] [SPEAKER_02]: oh you know i didn't do much the team is probably like oh yeah that's just them you know they're like a
[00:23:42.280] [SPEAKER_01]: body but now they're like oh wow like these are all the things jesus and joys i know i feel like it's
[00:23:49.540] [SPEAKER_00]: like talking the line of like reeks of desperation but also you know i'm just being vulnerable i'm putting
[00:23:54.780] [SPEAKER_00]: myself up and to be clear i'm not going on like a 10 minute rant about what i did but i'll be like oh
[00:24:01.120] [SPEAKER_00]: like i did this and that and i'm going here for the first time you know just a little bit more personality
[00:24:06.920] [SPEAKER_02]: than i'd normally would yeah dude in like five months time they'll be like oh what happened to all
[00:24:13.000] [SPEAKER_02]: of jesus energy so true you'll be like yeah i didn't do much this weekend they'll be like oh
[00:24:20.880] [SPEAKER_00]: you were so active just five months ago hopefully by then okay here's what i noticed i noticed that
[00:24:29.020] [SPEAKER_00]: the team members who are like ought to do much there's follow up questions that are available
[00:24:33.360] [SPEAKER_00]: because they know each other already oh i see so even if they give like a non answer
[00:24:37.740] [SPEAKER_00]: people like oh well how's this going or like how's so and so but for me i feel like there's no
[00:24:42.800] [SPEAKER_00]: baseline yet so i'm pumping them with as much interest possible so that in five months when i
[00:24:47.700] [SPEAKER_00]: burn out they'll be like oh i can be called this big by your bitch no literally like i'm just imagining
[00:24:54.520] [SPEAKER_02]: you're giving all this information life updates and then suddenly at one point you're just like yeah
[00:24:59.360] [SPEAKER_02]: like i'm a good weekend and people are like wait like what happened to all these storylines you
[00:25:04.180] [SPEAKER_02]: are sharing like all of these different aspects of your life we were finally like a drama
[00:25:09.400] [SPEAKER_00]: and now i'm just cutting us off dude storylines is so funny just Monday morning updates
[00:25:18.140] [SPEAKER_00]: but yeah hopefully in a couple months i'll be like oh my god i have all these work friends and i'm
[00:25:25.320] [SPEAKER_00]: calm queen out whatever's on shit so everyone pray for me and if there's anyone out there also like
[00:25:32.020] [SPEAKER_00]: sorry i knew job dms so that i don't go alone just kidding good luck to you guys as well she's not kidding
[00:25:43.340] [SPEAKER_02]: wait how long did it take for you to make your first work friend in your old job
[00:25:49.360] [SPEAKER_02]: like not necessarily closest friend but just like you know nice generic friend to have
[00:25:54.640] [SPEAKER_00]: so this is actually a crazy story but i think at the time like it maybe took me a month
[00:26:02.820] [SPEAKER_00]: or so i think it was a little bit easier because there was someone who i started at the same time
[00:26:09.100] [SPEAKER_00]: as she so then she and i like kind of bonded over that and then there was another person who i was
[00:26:14.360] [SPEAKER_00]: working with on like a project i she was really nice so then she and i would also like go out and get
[00:26:19.560] [SPEAKER_00]: lunch there was someone else who was around my age and i feel like being a new grad is like a very
[00:26:24.220] [SPEAKER_00]: specific experience like you start to look for people who will also look young so then she and i
[00:26:29.360] [SPEAKER_00]: also bonded but i think you're right it's not like i was having major problems at my old company
[00:26:35.180] [SPEAKER_00]: making friends it just took some time to feel comfortable and even get exposed to other people
[00:26:39.840] [SPEAKER_00]: through work so maybe i just need to wait it out a little bit i have faith in your friend
[00:26:45.920] [SPEAKER_00]: making ability and i'm so close it's just i mean for the most part it's fine it's just like some
[00:26:53.080] [SPEAKER_00]: moments where i'm like sitting at work and people are talking around me and i'm like i'm a
[00:26:57.940] [SPEAKER_00]: fucking loser but then you know with a surge of energy i like force myself to turn around and
[00:27:04.900] [SPEAKER_00]: like engage in the conversation you know yeah i feel like you have to be unafraid to just be the
[00:27:10.140] [SPEAKER_00]: person who puts themselves in the conversation uninvited sometimes yes very very true actually
[00:27:17.520] [SPEAKER_02]: i completely agree i i know what you're talking about too i think that's happened before to me
[00:27:22.980] [SPEAKER_02]: as well good literally people like right next to me are talking and i'm like do i engage
[00:27:29.380] [SPEAKER_00]: i'm so scary working and i feel like it's so funny because i just started so everyone knows i'm
[00:27:37.200] [SPEAKER_00]: not like really working you know i'm just like learning stuff i basically studying right
[00:27:43.220] [SPEAKER_00]: my people around me are talking and i'm like focus on my computer who am i convincing like i'm
[00:27:49.320] [SPEAKER_02]: not doing anything of substance right now yeah they're like what is Jesus doing like we didn't
[00:27:55.020] [SPEAKER_02]: give her any assignments this week what is she doing i know and you're like ingerost in your training
[00:28:02.760] [SPEAKER_00]: i'm like clearly so ingerost that i can't hear the loud conversation around me you're like
[00:28:08.980] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god this workplace safety video is a movie this is cinema hopefully i'm like a couple
[00:28:21.230] [SPEAKER_00]: weeks i can listen to this episode and laugh right now i feel like my laughing is like half crying
[00:28:26.270] [SPEAKER_02]: okay to be fair though i do feel like if you actually had a work it would be even more of a
[00:28:32.450] [SPEAKER_02]: connector to other people you know like right now you're still ramping up learning all the
[00:28:37.250] [SPEAKER_02]: systems and all that but then later when you actually have work that involves other people that's like
[00:28:43.210] [SPEAKER_02]: another point of connection so now you're missing that connection you're like yeah i'm just
[00:28:48.870] [SPEAKER_02]: watching these workplace ethic videos all day and other people are like do what i think that's
[00:28:55.730] [SPEAKER_00]: also the thing too like i don't have anything to contribute right now and i think literally like
[00:29:00.670] [SPEAKER_00]: starting next week i will be in that position but right now i'm in the position i'm like oh
[00:29:05.590] [SPEAKER_00]: do you understand this and i'm like yeah i think so but i have all these questions and then i'm just like
[00:29:10.170] [SPEAKER_00]: i don't know feeling semi useless even though it's not uselessness i'm just training yeah i think
[00:29:17.810] [SPEAKER_02]: it's like the lack of feeling useful i see i'm not getting to me so you're like shit not only am i not
[00:29:24.990] [SPEAKER_02]: providing valuable work right now but i'm also not making friends yeah i know but you know i'm ramping up
[00:29:34.970] [SPEAKER_00]: the social situation okay i believe it why did that sound so unconvincing when i said i believe
[00:29:44.550] [SPEAKER_00]: it i believe it i believe it robot voice do you eat lunch alone i don't so i've never eaten lunch alone
[00:29:54.830] [SPEAKER_02]: oh my god wait i'm like very impressed i literally have been working with the same team for like
[00:30:00.370] [SPEAKER_02]: two years almost three and i literally eat lunch alone like every day but that's like a little bit
[00:30:07.290] [SPEAKER_02]: more out of choice i think because i yeah it's the introvert in me yeah it's like your time to recharge
[00:30:14.830] [SPEAKER_02]: exactly recharge from the very minimal social work i'm doing anyway but i do feel like lunch is
[00:30:22.910] [SPEAKER_02]: pretty crucial in like you know building friendships especially if it's like one on one lunch like
[00:30:28.910] [SPEAKER_02]: forced to befriend the person across from you that is true i realized it's actually not that hard
[00:30:36.110] [SPEAKER_00]: to like keep the conversation going which was one of my fears i was like would i be able to hold
[00:30:40.910] [SPEAKER_00]: this conversation and also because like i had mentioned lunch convoes aren't my like favorite
[00:30:46.730] [SPEAKER_00]: thing in the world you know like i don't i don't i don't know it's like the eating while talking kind of
[00:30:50.950] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god that's the right no lunch with GCU okay i'm working on it but you know i just realized
[00:31:00.410] [SPEAKER_00]: there's like so much to talk about lowkey and you just have to search for the right
[00:31:06.050] [SPEAKER_02]: the perfect conversation topic like you're still feeling around to find the right connection
[00:31:10.650] [SPEAKER_02]: right exactly well imagine like five months later you're like okay actually guys please stop
[00:31:16.630] [SPEAKER_02]: having lunch with me i actually hate eating lunch with other people i'm like i know i've been
[00:31:22.890] [SPEAKER_00]: pretending this entire time but i don't fuck with lunch they're like oh my god
[00:31:31.470] [SPEAKER_00]: but you know work aside i happen having like a mini crisis in the last like two days or so
[00:31:40.010] [SPEAKER_00]: and let me start it like this like have you played roe blocks before?
[00:31:44.210] [SPEAKER_02]: no oh my god i think i know where this is going so i haven't played roe blocks but i do
[00:31:51.210] [SPEAKER_00]: know something is very popular in roe blocks yes yes so i've also never played roe blocks but
[00:31:59.230] [SPEAKER_00]: i saw some videos pop up on my TikTok feed recently where it was the skydamed k-so
[00:32:05.410] [SPEAKER_00]: who's like a streamer and he's been playing dressed in press on roe blocks
[00:32:08.810] [SPEAKER_00]: you hit! not only is it super funny watching this like random dude get really into like dress up
[00:32:18.430] [SPEAKER_00]: games i also have a long and deep history with dress up games myself and i used to play a
[00:32:24.950] [SPEAKER_00]: ton of them on like junior neighbor dot com when i was young so seeing it come back i'm like oh my god
[00:32:30.490] [SPEAKER_00]: this is amazing i literally watched like every single video that he's done i could not get enough
[00:32:35.910] [SPEAKER_00]: so i downloaded roe blocks which i did not know you could play this on your phone i thought it was
[00:32:41.690] [SPEAKER_00]: like a PC game only i didn't know that either i know so i downloaded it and started playing
[00:32:47.930] [SPEAKER_00]: dressed in press and it's so hard on the wall or we hard yeah and here's what makes it
[00:32:55.130] [SPEAKER_00]: hard you're not just putting together clothing pieces you have to walk your character around and
[00:32:59.690] [SPEAKER_00]: find them you know you're not like browsing a catalogue you have to like physically go and find
[00:33:04.310] [SPEAKER_00]: clothing item and then there's like a bunch of patterns and colors you can do and you can
[00:33:10.070] [SPEAKER_00]: customize like the colors of each clothing item right but the true magic of roe blocks comes from
[00:33:16.010] [SPEAKER_00]: your ability to layer clothing items because you can imagine it right it's like there's like a
[00:33:21.010] [SPEAKER_00]: tank top a t-shirt address whatever there's only like so much you could do if you just have one
[00:33:26.710] [SPEAKER_00]: top one bottom but when you layer like four tops in like the perfect order and the perfect shades
[00:33:33.690] [SPEAKER_00]: layer stockings and then socks over your stockings and the boots and then you know like all these
[00:33:38.550] [SPEAKER_00]: accessories that's where the magic happened and i'm like pretty sure i'm playing with 12
[00:33:45.770] [SPEAKER_00]: year olds unfortunately just by the way they type unlike you are not like a full grown adult
[00:33:50.070] [SPEAKER_00]: but they're fucking good oh my gosh so good okay i think dressed to impress is so funny
[00:33:58.010] [SPEAKER_02]: yeah because i've also seen a bunch of guy streamers get into it like you know some random
[00:34:05.210] [SPEAKER_02]: time like a fellow streamer friend is like oh my god like we should totally try out this game
[00:34:10.810] [SPEAKER_02]: and the guys are like i mean okay sure and then they you know they dress up their character they do
[00:34:16.050] [SPEAKER_02]: the walk in the pose yeah the girl is usually like oh my god like you did really well and then
[00:34:22.130] [SPEAKER_02]: guys stars being like a town you know i did do really like really start to get into
[00:34:30.650] [SPEAKER_02]: okay my theory here is that i feel like a lot of girls were like super into the dress up games
[00:34:36.810] [SPEAKER_02]: like you remember playing a lot of them too but guys didn't right so they missed out on this like
[00:34:43.430] [SPEAKER_02]: key experience so now they're like rove locks you know they're they're getting the experience
[00:34:49.090] [SPEAKER_02]: they're feeling the high of like dressing up your character and be like damn like they look
[00:34:53.230] [SPEAKER_00]: fucking good yeah yeah i fear i ate dude here's the crazy thing so there's like free play
[00:35:01.950] [SPEAKER_00]: on dressed to impress roe blocks and stuff but for the most part i fact the main game is like a contest
[00:35:07.330] [SPEAKER_00]: so there's like a voting system where you walk down the catwalk and you vote on everyone's outfits
[00:35:13.150] [SPEAKER_00]: i just find this game very hard in general and i have only gotten first twice okay once was
[00:35:21.090] [SPEAKER_00]: the theme was decades and then i was like decades like what can i do and then i thought i could do
[00:35:26.530] [SPEAKER_00]: the girlfriend clueless you know like curling yellow two peas so i slayed that and i got first and i was
[00:35:32.630] [SPEAKER_00]: like oh my god this is amazing i am high on this win but the other time i got first it was actually
[00:35:40.530] [SPEAKER_00]: games playing oh and i have to show you the photo to illustrate this wait then does that even mean
[00:35:47.470] [SPEAKER_00]: that you got first oh wait but let me show you so this is this is my outfit that one oh i like it
[00:35:56.750] [SPEAKER_00]: i was like this is a sleigh when james won i just cannot believe that they voted this first place
[00:36:07.090] [SPEAKER_00]: oh my god and this was his first time using the platform we were even having trouble finding
[00:36:16.450] [SPEAKER_00]: where to give the roe blocks character like a skin color so he was just like accidentally clicking
[00:36:21.510] [SPEAKER_02]: everything did it know how to unclick stuff so for our listeners it's literally a roebot mask
[00:36:29.150] [SPEAKER_00]: on the person's head and she's wearing like four t-shirts green leggings and no shoes no hair
[00:36:37.430] [SPEAKER_02]: this was what his competition was oh my god there's like second is like sailor moonask third i
[00:36:44.230] [SPEAKER_00]: can't see third was also like a sailor moon okay for that one the theme was anime or something
[00:36:49.490] [SPEAKER_00]: basically i realized what happened was there's like a little chat box and i didn't even see it
[00:36:54.110] [SPEAKER_00]: until after it ever unfolded what happened was everyone was complaining that all the sailor moons
[00:36:58.970] [SPEAKER_00]: for the anime theme were so basic that they voted everyone else low and voted my character
[00:37:05.370] [SPEAKER_00]: who is wearing like four t-shirts and leggings with no hair no skin color no shoes they voted that
[00:37:11.090] [SPEAKER_00]: up because they were like oh this is like clearly a newbie i don't care but like these other people
[00:37:17.210] [SPEAKER_00]: were being basic like i'm not going to vote them high oh there's like fucking roe blocks dressed in
[00:37:22.510] [SPEAKER_02]: politics yes because i was gonna say your roe blocks character that one has nothing to do with
[00:37:31.550] [SPEAKER_00]: i don't even i can't even remember what he was going for like rocklee or something for anime
[00:37:37.230] [SPEAKER_02]: all right anime yeah also this makes me wonder because you said a lot of the people are
[00:37:43.610] [SPEAKER_02]: clearly like young who are playing roe blocks you know how you dressed up one girl as clueless
[00:37:48.630] [SPEAKER_02]: like what if they don't even know the reference they're just like oh wow that's so cute
[00:37:53.670] [SPEAKER_00]: yeah that i yeah honestly that could be a possibility so what if you just keep taking outfits
[00:38:01.050] [SPEAKER_02]: from like older things and then people will be like oh my god that's like so new and fresh
[00:38:05.770] [SPEAKER_00]: like we've never seen that before where i'm dead hey our favorite court phrase there's no need to
[00:38:16.310] [SPEAKER_00]: some dress to impress clips later oh my god yes wait okay you should play it it's so fun
[00:38:23.410] [SPEAKER_00]: and i think a lot of the fun comes from seeing what outfits other people can make because that's
[00:38:29.910] [SPEAKER_00]: really fun for me like i don't care about my placements honestly i'm like usually dead last anyway
[00:38:34.270] [SPEAKER_00]: but seeing the magic of other people's outfits i'm like how the fuck did you do that like we all
[00:38:39.690] [SPEAKER_00]: only had four minutes or whatever it is so is it like you're just running around in a mall
[00:38:44.870] [SPEAKER_02]: and then you like meet back at the runaway point or something yeah you're kind of like walking
[00:38:50.910] [SPEAKER_00]: around in a big yeah kind of like a mall it's not that big but there's like a salon there's
[00:38:56.730] [SPEAKER_00]: like a skin tanning thingy the magic comes from the pattern that the color schemes interesting
[00:39:04.070] [SPEAKER_00]: well how is that a crisis okay i think the crisis part is like i don't know i feel like i just
[00:39:11.110] [SPEAKER_00]: played so much dress up games growing up that i thought i would slay this oh but everyone is so much
[00:39:17.090] [SPEAKER_00]: better and not only that i feel like the mechanics of moving around in roblox is so new and foreign
[00:39:22.450] [SPEAKER_00]: to me that i felt like i was doing it in a very clunky way i was trying to zoom out so that i could
[00:39:27.650] [SPEAKER_00]: get a better sense of where i was going and stuff and i was like making myself nauseous i was like
[00:39:32.510] [SPEAKER_00]: oh god like i don't know how to work these controls and for the first time i felt like i was
[00:39:38.090] [SPEAKER_00]: technology a little bit oh my god i know that's very dramatic but like no i understand
[00:39:44.430] [SPEAKER_02]: your life what is this technology yeah i was like how do i move you're like how do i get to
[00:39:52.330] [SPEAKER_01]: the hair salon i need to get to the salon James like fucking put this roba mask
[00:40:01.210] [SPEAKER_02]: it's like i'm broccoli first place so when you can play it on your phone is it like a
