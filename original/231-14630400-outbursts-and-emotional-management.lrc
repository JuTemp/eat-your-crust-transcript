[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crest podcast.
[00:00:02.100] I'm Crystal.
[00:00:02.859] I'm Gisoo.
[00:00:03.740] And I'm Brian.
[00:00:15.500] So welcome back, Brian.
[00:00:17.219] The last time we had Brian on was actually like five years ago.
[00:00:22.500] It was way back episode 33, socially awkward.
[00:00:27.679] He's an OG guest.
[00:00:28.839] Yes, that is me.
[00:00:29.760] Good to be back.
[00:00:32.200] Well, to be fair, Brian was living in Seattle
[00:00:34.920] for a really long time after college.
[00:00:36.920] And so now he just moved back to the bay, which is nice.
[00:00:40.600] We literally just saw him like two times in this last week,
[00:00:43.640] which isn't a pre-life.
[00:00:44.799] Wait, why do you saylapse. It is more.
[00:00:47.539] It's an improvement.
[00:00:48.640] I feel like before I was like maybe once every two years.
[00:00:52.640] That's true.
[00:00:53.640] Yeah.
[00:00:54.640] Wait, once every two years, I don't know about that.
[00:00:56.640] I was like COVID era though.
[00:00:57.880] Oh yeah.
[00:00:58.880] Yeah.
[00:00:59.880] So we're excited to have Brian back on and we have a Gen Z slang word to share today.
[00:01:06.319] The word itself is clears in like a phrase form. It's that clears or like you know this
[00:01:13.099] clears and the way I've seen it used is basically confirming that something is really good.
[00:01:18.900] So the way that I kind of think about it in my head is like oh that clears the bar.
[00:01:23.780] When I looked it up it also means if you're comparing
[00:01:26.799] two things, then like one thing clears the other. Yeah. I guess it's kind of like mogging.
[00:01:33.120] What is that? The silence. I've never heard that word in my life.
[00:01:40.239] So to me, I see mogging as kind of like an extension of mewing, which we talked about last time.
[00:01:45.640] But mogging is basically like when you see a photo of two people and one person looks really good in the picture and another person doesn't,
[00:01:51.879] then the person who looks good is mogging the other person.
[00:01:54.719] So they clear the ass of it, clear the other person.
[00:01:59.200] Okay, I only know of mogging because Jisoo told me this word, but like I've still never seen it out in the wild.
[00:02:04.640] Oh my god. And it's crazy but I've still never seen it on the wild. Oh my God.
[00:02:05.719] And it's crazy because I've also never seen clearing.
[00:02:08.680] It's like we're in different Gen Z pockets.
[00:02:10.520] Maybe, maybe.
[00:02:11.520] But Brian, have you seen either of these?
[00:02:13.280] I've seen clearing a lot.
[00:02:14.520] I feel like people use it a lot in sports,
[00:02:17.319] to be honest when they're comparing people,
[00:02:19.080] but Mogging just made that.
[00:02:21.919] Wait, it's a real word.
[00:02:23.719] Where did you see it?
[00:02:24.560] On TikTok.
[00:02:25.719] Yeah.
[00:02:26.960] We're the true Gen Z slang star.
[00:02:28.719] Actually, though.
[00:02:30.639] Well, I'll have to do some more scrolling then,
[00:02:32.599] because I've yet to see mogging.
[00:02:34.199] But I think clears is pretty funny,
[00:02:35.800] because I've also seen it.
[00:02:37.319] I think Brian's right.
[00:02:38.159] A lot of it is maybe sports-related,
[00:02:40.439] but I have also seen it where maybe someone is like,
[00:02:43.039] oh, hot take, but blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:45.360] And then sometimes people will say like, that clears.
[00:02:47.800] Like that's okay and that's acceptable kind of.
[00:02:50.280] Which I feel like is pretty funny
[00:02:51.800] because it's just like a long list of comments.
[00:02:53.960] Like that clears that.
[00:02:55.159] Like, wait, actually I agree.
[00:02:57.159] It's kind of like valid.
[00:02:58.560] I feel like valid people would also do
[00:03:00.639] that valid comment chain.
[00:03:01.960] Yeah.
[00:03:02.800] Okay, this is kind of stupid maybe,
[00:03:04.800] but every time I read that clears,
[00:03:06.520] I just imagine someone doing pole vaulting.
[00:03:09.840] Like, why you said clear the bar?
[00:03:15.759] You meant like a literal physical bar?
[00:03:19.080] I think when I was first trying to understand it,
[00:03:21.439] I was like, hmm, is this like limbo or polo-tick? I kind of get that,
[00:03:26.800] but polo-tick and action. Yeah, I can see it. Well, Gen Z were to side. Let's kind of jump into our
[00:03:31.919] topic today. So today we wanted to do an episode about outbursts. I feel like this is a constant
[00:03:40.080] joke slash inspiration for me and Crystal because there was this one time we were traveling
[00:03:45.560] with James and Aabi, our friend, in Spain and Portugal.
[00:03:49.319] I think anyone who's been on a long vacation with friends kind of understands what happens.
[00:03:53.960] It's very natural for things to kind of pile up during the vacation, nothing heavy, but
[00:03:58.560] just emotions kind of stir up like that.
[00:04:00.680] And then someone will have like an outburst in the middle.
[00:04:03.479] And I feel like it's always kind of funny, kind of cathartic, and it kind of makes everything a
[00:04:06.840] lot more light-hearted. So this episode goes out to James and Avi and it also
[00:04:11.039] goes out to our outbursts. Oh my god, the outburst that happened on that trip was
[00:04:15.680] really funny. When I walk, I kind of swing my arms and it's like kind of a joke
[00:04:21.120] between us or it's like, oh, Chris, why do you swing your arms so much when you're
[00:04:24.600] walking? Because I swing my arms, it's easy for of a joke between us where it's like, oh, Crystal, why do you swing your arms so much when you're walking?
[00:04:25.480] Because I swing my arms, it's easy for me
[00:04:27.800] to like accidentally hit someone else's hand.
[00:04:30.639] And so it was like getting pretty late.
[00:04:32.279] Maybe it was like one of the last like three or four days.
[00:04:35.079] Me and Avi's hand collided and I was like,
[00:04:37.439] oh my God, our hands brushed.
[00:04:39.720] Avi was like, maybe if you stopped swinging your arms.
[00:04:42.319] So like Avi literally stopped walking turned around to face Chris on the middle of the street
[00:04:47.019] and like, yelled this.
[00:04:48.180] I was like, oh my God, we've been vacationing for too long.
[00:04:52.100] How deep into the trip was this?
[00:04:53.519] This was like the last leg, like the very last leg.
[00:04:55.839] Yeah.
[00:04:56.680] And like, the total trip was about two weeks.
[00:04:58.180] So like, building up.
[00:04:59.420] Yeah, the rivers are flowering.
[00:05:00.600] Yeah.
[00:05:01.660] It was so funny though.
[00:05:02.500] I think after you said that, we all just kind of paused and then burst out laughing. Yeah. It was so funny, though. I think after you said that, we all just kind of paused
[00:05:05.379] and then burst out laughing.
[00:05:08.339] And then now to this day, Avi and our group chat
[00:05:10.500] is named outburst.
[00:05:13.459] To clarify everything, though, what
[00:05:15.500] do you define as an outburst?
[00:05:18.180] I feel like in retrospect, it's always
[00:05:20.420] a moment where you kind of lost your cool.
[00:05:22.579] Like maybe just a little bit.
[00:05:24.220] For me, I always feel a little bit embarrassed
[00:05:26.800] about it afterwards, but yeah, I feel like sometimes
[00:05:29.720] you have tension or like frustration building up
[00:05:31.959] and then you just kind of like let it out.
[00:05:35.160] I think that's a good description for it.
[00:05:38.680] I would also kind of describe it as a moment
[00:05:41.360] where I show more emotion than what's appropriate probably
[00:05:44.759] and I feel like it usually happens because I've been holding something back for a long time.
[00:05:48.279] So there's definitely a bit of a build-up aspect to it.
[00:05:51.519] Yeah, I agree. And also it's kind of like Brian said like a momentary explosion of emotion.
[00:05:58.279] Or maybe like a quick snap, you snap at someone or something of that sort.
[00:06:02.560] I think it's also funny maybe because everything
[00:06:06.639] leading up to it is usually very normal
[00:06:09.480] and I'm just like, oh, suddenly.
[00:06:11.600] It's like a lie-hearted,
[00:06:13.040] you know, like there's been something like gnawing
[00:06:15.279] that you probably want to just like,
[00:06:17.120] you guys usually like in the moment,
[00:06:21.519] way, whether or not to do it or,
[00:06:23.920] is it just kind of, it just happens. That's do it or is it just kind of it just happens?
[00:06:25.759] That's a really good question. I feel like it just happens. Like you don't think and then after it
[00:06:29.600] happens you're like oh wait I didn't have to do that. Wait I actually feel like I sort of wait.
[00:06:35.439] Oh really? And I try to like validate myself. I'm like is this crazy or is this normal? And then
[00:06:39.839] I'm usually like this is normal and then I do it and I was like wait that was crazy.
[00:06:41.720] I'm usually like, this is normal. And then I do it and I was like, wait, that was crazy.
[00:06:43.879] No.
[00:06:44.879] No.
[00:06:45.879] Lared on night when you're trying to sleep, you're like staring at the ceiling.
[00:06:48.519] Yeah.
[00:06:49.519] Maybe I shouldn't.
[00:06:50.519] Like why did I do that?
[00:06:52.199] I wonder if Avi ever stays up and thinks about that.
[00:06:55.879] No.
[00:06:56.879] He's like, I'm called out first now forever.
[00:07:00.639] I feel like when traveling is definitely like the most common time.
[00:07:03.360] Oh my god, for sure.
[00:07:04.360] That would have happened with your friends.
[00:07:05.000] That's true. I also feel like it probably happens a little bit more with people you're more comfortable with.
[00:07:10.000] I feel like when I'm around family, I'm like more prone to help person.
[00:07:14.000] Yeah. Because I'm like, let's fucking go. Let's do it it out.
[00:07:17.000] True, true.
[00:07:21.000] Do you think there's anything specific that triggers you?
[00:07:24.000] So I have something specific that does trigger me,
[00:07:28.279] but I feel like it's gonna make me sound so petty.
[00:07:30.879] So it just apologies to everyone in advance.
[00:07:33.879] But I feel like something that really causes
[00:07:36.480] an outburst for me is if before that,
[00:07:38.939] I'm like doing stuff that I feel like
[00:07:40.459] is kind of a sacrifice or like,
[00:07:42.160] oh, I'll be the bigger person and like,
[00:07:44.240] do this or whatever. And I'm kind of a sacrifice or like, oh, I'll be the bigger person and like, do this or whatever.
[00:07:45.639] And I'm kind of validating myself into thinking,
[00:07:48.040] oh, I'm like a good person for doing this.
[00:07:50.160] So then if I'm constantly in that mindset
[00:07:52.459] and then something happens,
[00:07:53.600] I'm like, I can't fucking take this anymore
[00:07:55.120] and I'm gonna out first.
[00:07:56.600] But I guess it's not like conscious while I'm doing it.
[00:07:58.959] I'm just more like, decision by decision.
[00:08:00.920] I'm like, oh, this is probably helpful.
[00:08:02.600] Like I should probably do this.
[00:08:04.079] But I think it just builds up into like me thinking that there's like a long
[00:08:07.079] history of sacrifice.
[00:08:08.480] But really it's not that serious.
[00:08:10.680] Right.
[00:08:11.160] Honestly, I could relate.
[00:08:12.240] I think that would definitely lead to an outburst for me too.
[00:08:16.920] No, for sure.
[00:08:17.759] I actually have a pretty funny story related to that.
[00:08:20.439] And it also ties back to the travel thing too.
[00:08:22.879] But so I went to France a few years ago with two of my friends.
[00:08:26.800] We're not very big planners, any of us,
[00:08:28.920] but because I'd never been there before,
[00:08:30.519] I probably planned a little bit more than usual
[00:08:32.320] and made itinerary.
[00:08:33.320] And then we went to that really famous museum,
[00:08:36.360] not the Louvre, but the other one like-
[00:08:38.600] Dorsay or something?
[00:08:39.440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:40.600] Okay, so none of us are like art people at all.
[00:08:43.960] I'm like never moved by art,
[00:08:45.480] but I'm probably gonna have to go
[00:08:47.200] because it's like one of the most popular places.
[00:08:49.720] And low-key, I was kind of lying to myself
[00:08:53.120] at the end of the city and going.
[00:08:55.600] So when we got there,
[00:08:56.440] my two friends were like super unimpressed
[00:08:58.240] and I'm like 20 minutes in,
[00:08:59.519] they're just like, is this cool, Brian?
[00:09:01.080] You go take a look, like we'll just wait here.
[00:09:03.960] Let us know when you're done.
[00:09:05.240] It was pretty funny in a moment,
[00:09:06.399] but then after they kept roasting me about it.
[00:09:08.360] And because I did the planning,
[00:09:10.559] I went off on the...
[00:09:11.960] I remember we were walking, leaving the museum.
[00:09:16.279] I was like, you guys can't do that
[00:09:17.759] if you're not gonna plan it.
[00:09:18.840] Oh my God.
[00:09:19.679] And it was awkward for like 10 minutes.
[00:09:21.840] And then later I was like, sorry.
[00:09:23.600] This is also funny because I cannot imagine Brian going off on
[00:09:28.159] someone. Okay it's cuz like one of them's like my best friend and the other
[00:09:31.519] guys like his brother so I'm really close to him. So it's kind of like what you're
[00:09:34.399] saying because you're so comfortable with right. Right. Yeah I feel it's like
[00:09:37.600] people I wasn't as close to I'd definitely be on my best. No but that's
[00:09:42.960] valid. I feel like I have a similar story that I've actually shared on the pod before.
[00:09:48.279] It was when I went on a family trip to Hawaii last year, and I basically planned the whole
[00:09:53.240] thing.
[00:09:54.240] And I was like, you know, none of us have been to Hawaii.
[00:09:56.039] So originally I was going to go by myself, but maybe you guys should tag along.
[00:10:01.480] So I basically like planned everything, booked some dinners.
[00:10:05.440] It wasn't that intricate,
[00:10:06.600] but it was just like putting the basic
[00:10:08.399] just of stuff together.
[00:10:09.779] I think my dad was kind of being difficult sometimes.
[00:10:13.399] To be fair, he had to work remotely
[00:10:15.620] for some parts of the trip.
[00:10:17.320] One night I had a dinner booked for all of us,
[00:10:19.879] and then my dad had been skipping a lot of the dinners.
[00:10:23.360] He was like, oh, what's the plan tonight?
[00:10:24.799] And I was like, oh, we have dinner planned.? And I was like, oh, we have dinner plan.
[00:10:26.039] And then I was like, oh, let me guess.
[00:10:27.360] You're not coming.
[00:10:28.200] And he was like, you're right.
[00:10:29.679] Actually, I was about to say that.
[00:10:31.279] And I was like, dude, OK, actually,
[00:10:32.879] I can give you a ride then to the airport.
[00:10:34.960] And he was like, wait, what?
[00:10:39.080] Every time I hear this, I'm mind-blowing by the fact
[00:10:42.080] that you said that.
[00:10:43.159] It's so satisfying.
[00:10:44.799] I don't know.
[00:10:45.519] Yeah, you had that ready.
[00:10:46.639] Yeah.
[00:10:48.120] With a punchline in every day to the airport.
[00:10:53.120] Literally when I said it though, I was like,
[00:10:54.720] damn, like that hit.
[00:10:58.440] And I was like, oh shit, that was so clever.
[00:11:00.320] Like go me.
[00:11:02.360] I ate.
[00:11:04.120] You cleared Chris' door.
[00:11:06.000] But yeah, I feel like also
[00:11:08.000] People say try not to bottle up your emotions
[00:11:10.000] So, you know, maybe having outbursts is healthy.
[00:11:13.000] Mmm, that's true.
[00:11:15.000] It's like interesting though.
[00:11:16.000] So I have a similar outbursts story
[00:11:18.000] Except this time it wasn't rage
[00:11:20.000] I was more like sad sort of
[00:11:22.000] So there was a time where I went to Korea
[00:11:24.000] With two other people And I was like the only Korean person
[00:11:27.279] on the trip.
[00:11:28.120] So I had like planned the itinerary out and stuff.
[00:11:30.600] And I was kind of like showing them around,
[00:11:32.840] except I'm American, so I'm not really showing anyone around.
[00:11:35.759] Right, right.
[00:11:36.600] I think all of it was like fine.
[00:11:37.799] The people I was traveling were very like easygoing
[00:11:40.080] and like down and do whatever.
[00:11:41.240] But the only thing is like,
[00:11:43.039] if you're the sole communicator,
[00:11:45.159] the only person who speaks that language,
[00:11:46.799] I feel like it could be a little bit stressful.
[00:11:49.080] It's a lot of pressure.
[00:11:50.080] It is.
[00:11:50.919] And for some reason on that trip,
[00:11:52.559] every taxi driver I was talking to was really fucking rude.
[00:11:56.120] Oh no.
[00:11:56.960] And I'm also sensitive.
[00:11:58.080] I'm prone to be offended.
[00:12:00.440] So then it felt extra rude to me.
[00:12:02.879] So then this one time,
[00:12:04.200] probably the sixth or seventh
[00:12:05.879] rude taxi driver or some shit.
[00:12:07.519] And I was like, you know what?
[00:12:08.679] I'm like so fucking over this, right?
[00:12:10.320] So I was sitting in the back,
[00:12:11.519] like in the very back of this van
[00:12:13.159] and then the two people I was traveling with,
[00:12:14.600] they were in the middle.
[00:12:15.600] And I just started like sobbing.
[00:12:17.480] And it's like, if you think about it,
[00:12:18.799] it's like, oh, the taxi driver was rude.
[00:12:20.399] It's like whatever, right?
[00:12:21.440] But I think because it was constantly happening,
[00:12:23.879] I was like, oh, literally just dying in the back.
[00:12:28.519] I mean, I feel like that's understandable.
[00:12:30.600] It's very valid.
[00:12:31.440] Yeah.
[00:12:31.799] Your frustration, it's also the travel thing.
[00:12:33.639] Like you're really tired.
[00:12:34.720] Yeah.
[00:12:35.600] And then your frustration's building up a lot.
[00:12:37.559] There's kind of a tipping point where you're just like,
[00:12:39.799] dude, I'm so over this.
[00:12:41.720] Your brain is on overdrive, like translating everything,
[00:12:45.519] speaking English to your friends
[00:12:47.159] and then like speaking Korean to everyone else.
[00:12:49.840] I feel like it's a lot.
[00:12:51.200] That's true.
[00:12:52.179] And it's also like a big city.
[00:12:53.679] I'm assuming you're in Seoul.
[00:12:55.200] And so like a lot of stimulation around you.
[00:12:57.440] Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:59.039] I know traveling just makes us so sensitive, I guess.
[00:13:02.200] Oh my God, I had traveled to Tokyo recently.
[00:13:05.679] I was like, dude, I'm literally like a mute here.
[00:13:08.700] Dude, I just went to Tokyo and I felt exactly right.
[00:13:13.200] Yeah.
[00:13:14.500] And then I would like go home and I'd be like,
[00:13:16.279] oh my god, I need to make sure to talk to myself
[00:13:18.240] because I don't think I've heard my voice
[00:13:19.799] for like the best two cobwebs in your mouth.
[00:13:22.879] The reason I bring this up is because I was browsing TikTok
[00:13:26.159] and then I saw some other people that were like,
[00:13:28.279] yeah, I traveled to Japan recently, usually Tokyo,
[00:13:31.879] and they're like, it is super fun,
[00:13:33.600] but also so overwhelming, because the city is big,
[00:13:36.639] you don't speak the language, you're like,
[00:13:38.879] what do I say?
[00:13:40.080] Maybe one Japanese phrase.
[00:13:43.159] And then the girl was literally making the TikTok and sobbing.
[00:13:46.480] She's like, I don't know why I'm crying.
[00:13:49.279] I'm just overstimulated for like, it's not that deep.
[00:13:52.960] I was like, this is such a valid TikTok.
[00:13:56.720] Yeah, I just went to Japan and Korea over Christmas, and then it was like a two and
[00:14:02.600] half week stay in those two countries.
[00:14:04.679] And when I got back to America
[00:14:05.879] I was like I've never been so happy
[00:14:09.240] In my life like the passport guys like welcome back. I'm like, thanks
[00:14:15.399] Like get every word in you can actually
[00:14:18.679] My god, that's so funny when you go into like restaurants and stuff. I guess you can pass for right right local
[00:14:24.639] So over and over again just like oh no like like and stuff, I guess you can pass for a local. So over and over again, just like, oh no, like, you know, like just reading like I'm not.
[00:14:29.399] Yeah.
[00:14:30.559] The disappointment in there after like another tourist.
[00:14:35.200] Do you guys think you have outbursts outside of travel?
[00:14:38.600] Not often, but like, I was like thinking about this.
[00:14:42.519] There's definitely a few I can pinpoint over the last few years and I feel like a lot of times
[00:14:47.039] when something's gnawing at like something
[00:14:48.559] you're self-conscious about and it's like,
[00:14:50.980] honestly a lot of times it's like your friends
[00:14:53.000] or like your bros.
[00:14:54.679] But yeah, like there's been a few times
[00:14:57.559] you're kind of at your limit.
[00:14:58.840] Mm hmm.
[00:14:59.840] I feel like that is very understandable
[00:15:01.759] and I think especially maybe if people are taking advantage of some sort of leniency or patience that you have for them,
[00:15:10.000] kind of similar to what you were saying earlier to Jisoo, how like you feel like you were being patient with people or giving them leniency and then it just like keeps happening,
[00:15:19.000] I can totally see how that would like build up and then at a certain point you're like, all right, like this is where we draw the line.
[00:15:32.559] I think I can relate to that and for me, I think my outbursts actually happen at work sometimes.
[00:15:37.759] So I guess at work, it's not necessarily like a huge emotional outburst, right? But I think it feels more like an intense outburst because I'm still trying to keep it contained
[00:15:42.879] during the outburst. Like a professional outburst.
[00:15:45.639] Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:46.279] Exactly.
[00:15:47.279] Oh my god.
[00:15:49.279] And I think it always happens on tough work weeks
[00:15:51.480] where maybe you're putting in some long hours
[00:15:53.480] or honestly times where you feel like you're picking
[00:15:56.679] up assignments for other people as a favor.
[00:15:59.360] I feel like it really gets to me.
[00:16:01.480] It hasn't happened recently, but in my professional career
[00:16:04.399] I have had a time where I cried during a TV with my boss
[00:16:08.960] and I was just like,
[00:16:09.799] I don't think it's anymore.
[00:16:11.159] Like there's so many assignments and blah blah blah.
[00:16:13.600] And then he was like,
[00:16:15.200] honestly, I wish you weren't crying,
[00:16:16.759] but I totally understand and hear you.
[00:16:18.559] So let's like cut back on the workload and whatnot.
[00:16:21.519] So I think even though it was like embarrassing,
[00:16:24.879] like Brian mentioned before, I still even though it was like embarrassing, like Brian mentioned before,
[00:16:26.399] I still feel like it was a productive outburst
[00:16:28.840] because it got the message through a little bit.
[00:16:32.080] Damn, professional and productive.
[00:16:33.879] Yeah.
[00:16:34.720] Yeah.
[00:16:35.720] Double wins.
[00:16:37.919] I could totally see how work can cause outburst though,
[00:16:41.200] but I feel like maybe in my personal experience,
[00:16:44.600] it would be more outbursts outside of work because of work.
[00:16:47.679] Right?
[00:16:48.519] Because that's a good point.
[00:16:49.559] I think it's very natural to get frustrated at work.
[00:16:52.600] Sometimes it feels like everyone's just doing nothing
[00:16:54.879] and then you're like along for the wave of like nothing
[00:16:58.639] or it just feels like things aren't getting done
[00:17:01.120] and like people are asking you to do this
[00:17:02.679] but a hinge is on like all these other people.
[00:17:04.880] It's just so complicated and very prone to frustrations
[00:17:10.200] from everyone, I think.
[00:17:12.039] I know, sometimes I feel like work would be so easy
[00:17:14.440] if there wasn't all this interpersonal relationship stuff
[00:17:17.119] that you also had to do along with your assignments.
[00:17:19.359] Oh, dude, actually though, some advice I had gotten was,
[00:17:24.079] don't forget that your coworkers are people too.
[00:17:27.180] That advice is kind of like,
[00:17:29.279] oh, if you build a better relationship with your coworkers
[00:17:34.000] and they like you more than usually everyone is down
[00:17:36.940] to give each other more leniency.
[00:17:38.859] That's true.
[00:17:39.700] But I guess if we were all just purely cogs, numbers,
[00:17:45.299] maybe it would be more strict,
[00:17:46.900] but we would all get shit done.
[00:17:48.259] Yeah.
[00:17:49.740] There was a funny moment at work,
[00:17:51.859] ones where I witnessed someone else's outburst.
[00:17:54.660] And I think I thought it was funny
[00:17:56.140] because I didn't personally have emotional stakes
[00:17:59.099] in the situation at hand,
[00:18:00.839] but watching someone else outburst at work
[00:18:03.420] is a very interesting experience, I would say.
[00:18:06.099] I feel like it kind of feels good in a sense that like everyone is
[00:18:09.660] kind of bottling emotions at work.
[00:18:11.279] Like no one is really trying to show it.
[00:18:13.039] So then when you see it for the first time, it's kind of like a release,
[00:18:16.019] like, Oh, other people also have emotions and feelings.
[00:18:18.940] And it's like very normal and human.
[00:18:20.900] But also it's because it's supposed to be such a professional environment.
[00:18:24.839] It also feels and looks very out of place. one human, but also because it's supposed to be such a professional environment, it also
[00:18:25.200] feels and looks very out of place.
[00:18:27.640] So I just remember this person kind of like outbursts in a meeting which triggered another
[00:18:32.039] person to outbursts.
[00:18:33.039] Oh my god.
[00:18:34.039] So they were like kind of yelling at each other and then the rest of us were like muted.
[00:18:37.440] Like some people started turning their cameras off and I was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[00:18:41.880] Oh my god.
[00:18:42.880] I actually had that exact same experience when I was interning.
[00:18:46.799] We had like a sprint planning meeting and then the PM and the leads software engineer
[00:18:51.539] just like disagreed on this work task and how long it would take and it's just evolved
[00:18:56.180] into like a straight up like shouting match.
[00:18:58.440] Oh my God.
[00:18:59.440] Yeah.
[00:19:00.440] And then this was like, I think that was like two or three weeks into the internship.
[00:19:03.839] And then it was when those were like,
[00:19:06.200] the meeting was ending,
[00:19:07.359] the tensions weren't cooling at all.
[00:19:09.480] So I remember like my mentor at the time was like,
[00:19:11.960] oh, like you can go first.
[00:19:13.640] She like messaged me and she was like,
[00:19:15.240] it's not usually like this.
[00:19:16.400] I swear like.
[00:19:18.000] She's like, please stay.
[00:19:19.559] I was like, but you're right.
[00:19:21.480] It was really interesting and low-key entertaining.
[00:19:24.079] Be honest.
[00:19:24.920] I was just like, but you're right. It was really interesting and low-key entertaining. Yeah. Be honest, I was just like, damn.
[00:19:27.680] I had an experience. It wasn't like a true outburst, but I think it was like a stern mini outburst.
[00:19:36.400] Like one time me and a couple, it was actually also an internship. Me and a couple of my co-workers, we wanted to work on a project and we had some
[00:19:47.359] ideas to present. But for some reason, the meeting we booked with someone who was like,
[00:19:52.720] higher up, I think she was like director level, we weren't ready for it.
[00:19:56.640] And so we were going at the meeting and we're kind of like, oh wait, we might not be ready
[00:20:01.440] for this meeting. She hops on the phone and then we're like,
[00:20:05.720] um, yeah, we're like trying desperately to explain.
[00:20:09.440] Like our ideas, I guess.
[00:20:10.960] And then maybe like after a couple minutes,
[00:20:13.559] she was like, okay, I think it seems like
[00:20:16.000] you are all still in the brainstorming phase right now.
[00:20:20.359] So how about we set up a meeting later
[00:20:22.240] when you feel more ready?
[00:20:23.559] That way we can all use our time wisely
[00:20:26.099] Oh my god, and and then you know she left and we were all like
[00:20:29.759] Yeah, like we that was not good
[00:20:33.559] You know, I feel like what I find kind of funny about watching other people out first though is
[00:20:41.319] Your outburst story crystal seems like it was handled in a very mature way.
[00:20:45.599] But honestly, sometimes even the work ones, it kind of devolves into almost childish behavior
[00:20:51.680] because at the root of it, when we were young, we didn't have as much control over our emotions.
[00:20:56.000] So I feel like that's the last time we were able to let our emotions run freely,
[00:21:01.279] like unregulated. But now in our adulthood, like sometimes it comes out
[00:21:06.579] professionally, but other times I'm like, okay,
[00:21:08.539] these people are like two minutes away from becoming
[00:21:11.740] like a childhood playground sort of thing,
[00:21:14.619] where they're like walking each other and trying to get.
[00:21:18.019] I would love to see that in a meeting.
[00:21:19.420] Oh yeah.
[00:21:20.259] I would love it.
[00:21:22.059] I think one of the out first story I was mentioning earlier, one of the last few lines was like,
[00:21:26.240] Oh yeah, I'm gonna take this up with upper management football, but and I was like,
[00:21:29.599] Oh, he's about to tattle on the teacher.
[00:21:34.400] Dude, one of my friends, she has like a honestly really immature team.
[00:21:38.240] She's like a PM on it. So she's like in the center of it, but she was like showing me their slag chat once and she was like,
[00:21:44.160] Dude, is this normal? Like this is happening on the team so basically there
[00:21:47.680] was these two lead engineers and they're arguing over route A or route B which
[00:21:52.059] was gonna take and then the first guy was like super stubborn just not
[00:21:55.480] listening to anything and then the second I was like you know what like you
[00:21:58.880] never listen to me at all like you go with whatever you want I'm done and in
[00:22:02.559] the first guy was like okay so route it And she showed me that I was like, dude,
[00:22:08.420] your team is so toxic.
[00:22:09.859] That's so funny.
[00:22:11.339] Oh my god.
[00:22:12.180] He's like, okay, I won't.
[00:22:14.140] I guess for these outbursts
[00:22:15.660] that we've just been talking about,
[00:22:16.900] a lot of the emotion is frustration.
[00:22:19.819] But do you feel like there's other emotions
[00:22:21.900] that are also tied to these kinds of outbursts?
[00:22:24.779] So for me, I would say I have two very predominant outbursts related emotions and I'm just
[00:22:30.599] gonna make a disclaimer that they're both very childish.
[00:22:34.000] So one is sheer unadulterated rage where I'm like fuck this, fuck the world, fuck everything.
[00:22:39.759] And then the other one is feeling very wronged, which I feel like to me that is like peak childish.
[00:22:46.200] That's what happens when you're like a kid and you're like,
[00:22:48.480] why does mom want me to do this?
[00:22:49.880] Or like whatever?
[00:22:50.880] So then every time I feel that way,
[00:22:52.240] I have to like really talk myself back into adulthood.
[00:22:56.880] Interesting.
[00:22:58.359] When I heard the question, honestly,
[00:22:59.839] I feel like the root of it is always frustration,
[00:23:01.799] but if you're listening to what you said,
[00:23:03.880] I think it kind of boils down to those two for me too.
[00:23:08.440] So yeah.
[00:23:10.440] Let's go.
[00:23:12.119] Yeah, I think maybe rage is not as high for me,
[00:23:16.079] but I can agree with the wrong.
[00:23:18.039] Like you just feel, I don't even,
[00:23:19.880] yeah, there's no other way to describe it, right?
[00:23:21.480] Like you've been wrong.
[00:23:22.960] I feel like that would make most people pretty upset.
[00:23:26.200] And then I guess like the other feeling
[00:23:29.019] is a bit more like frustration or annoyance.
[00:23:32.460] I'm thinking about this thing where this person was like,
[00:23:35.200] oh my God, I got this like wheel of emotions.
[00:23:39.400] And now I use it to truly define what emotions I'm feeling.
[00:23:44.099] And I was like, whoa, maybe some of the emotions
[00:23:46.480] we think we're feeling is actually like a different emotion.
[00:23:49.240] Whoa.
[00:23:50.079] So it's not just like sad or mad.
[00:23:51.759] It's like more nuanced.
[00:23:53.359] There's depth to it.
[00:23:54.279] Yeah.
[00:23:55.279] Yeah.
[00:23:55.799] Wait, so how does the wheel of emotion thing work?
[00:23:58.240] I think it's just like a list or a wheel for that person
[00:24:01.519] that has all these different emotions.
[00:24:03.599] And then it has a little definition under it.
[00:24:06.079] Yeah, so I'm trying to think of an example, but like I can only think of the basic emotions.
[00:24:11.519] Rage.
[00:24:14.240] I think I've seen one where it's like a wheel, but there's kind of like funnels.
[00:24:19.279] So it's like it starts with like the three like big ones like oh sad or mad or whatever.
[00:24:24.640] And then it boils down into like, oh, I'm upset
[00:24:27.279] or like I'm depressed or, you know,
[00:24:29.079] like more categorized levels, I guess.
[00:24:32.720] I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:33.839] I feel like when something happens,
[00:24:35.559] you'll relate to the most overarching emotion,
[00:24:38.480] the most like fear or not fear would fuck.
[00:24:40.480] Whoa, you got something to say about it.
[00:24:43.119] Whoa, sorry, like frustration or like anger.
[00:24:47.599] But as you like kind of sit on it and mullen it,
[00:24:50.279] like you're processing how you feel about that's kind
[00:24:52.400] of when the more under the surface emotions come out.
[00:24:55.640] So I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:57.720] I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
[00:24:59.240] I think for me, also feeling misunderstood
[00:25:01.680] makes me very out-first prone as well.
[00:25:03.559] Mm, yeah.
[00:25:04.519] I guess it kind of falls under the feeling wrong category.
[00:25:07.200] Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:08.200] I'm a victim because blank.
[00:25:09.799] But feeling misunderstood or feeling like you're going unheard, I feel like, is really isolating.
[00:25:14.799] Yes.
[00:25:15.799] I definitely do think it has a lot to do with repression.
[00:25:18.200] It's like the more I'm forced to repress something, the bigger the outburst is.
[00:25:21.599] Oh my God, because you're bottling it up.
[00:25:24.000] Yeah. It's like a soda can about to explode.
[00:25:27.519] Thinking along what more specific feelings
[00:25:30.680] would maybe apply,
[00:25:32.200] kind of on the similar vein as what you said,
[00:25:34.720] Jisoo, maybe feeling underappreciated.
[00:25:38.720] But I guess along the lines of the emotions that we feel,
[00:25:43.039] do you think you're the type to have more variance in your emotional
[00:25:47.759] state or are you like a little more, I guess, like steady in your typical day-to-day?
[00:25:54.160] So I do feel like I'm the type to have higher highs and lower lows. I feel like on most days,
[00:26:00.160] I feel pretty even killed. But I do feel like if something happens I'm pretty prone to being like emotionally affected by it. Where is that like?
[00:26:07.700] I think it goes both ways like I get happy and like excited like pretty easily
[00:26:11.900] But I'll also get like dejected kind of easily to something's like not going right
[00:26:16.259] Actually, I think I can relate to that. I was reflecting kind of recently where I was thinking about like stressful situations and I can probably manage
[00:26:26.799] Mild stress, okay, but sometimes if it just feels like the world is against you. I like crumble
[00:26:32.559] I'm like, oh god, I can't yeah for sure
[00:26:35.279] Yeah, especially if it's like if something happens in isolation
[00:26:38.400] It's fine, but a lot can happen in a week and if like two or three things like pile on each other
[00:26:43.000] Oh, yeah, yeah, like you feel super pushed down by a kind of.
[00:26:47.240] But I think I would say maybe like day to day,
[00:26:50.960] I'm maybe a little more steady,
[00:26:53.640] but I feel like that's also cause like my day to day
[00:26:56.160] is very repetitive and normal.
[00:26:58.960] Honestly, you're so right.
[00:27:00.079] I didn't think about that, but in a day
[00:27:02.400] there's like nothing that I consistently.
[00:27:04.599] It's like wake up, go to work,
[00:27:07.559] and go home and chill, and then sleep.
[00:27:09.880] It's like, okay, I can handle this.
[00:27:12.039] I feel like it's kind of a pendulum sometimes,
[00:27:14.839] because I think I relate to both of you.
[00:27:16.759] There are so many days where I feel unemotional,
[00:27:20.279] but it's kind of like I'm emotionally numb.
[00:27:22.880] It's like almost like I'm choosing not to feel emotions
[00:27:25.440] because otherwise I would spiral.
[00:27:27.279] And then there are other days where I'm like,
[00:27:28.599] oh my God, I'm having so much fun.
[00:27:30.319] And then like three hours later,
[00:27:31.319] I'm like, I literally hate my life
[00:27:32.880] and I cannot handle this world.
[00:27:35.000] So for me, I definitely swing,
[00:27:37.039] but I think to try to get through life,
[00:27:39.759] sometimes you have to be like numb,
[00:27:41.799] not to be all like emo.
[00:27:43.680] I think to me that's why I value therapy so much.
[00:27:49.559] Cause I just sit there for 50 minutes and I'm like saying so many things.
[00:27:53.799] And it's like sometimes you just sit there and I feel like the emotions come out.
[00:27:57.000] And later I realize it's not that therapy induced these emotions.
[00:28:01.240] It's more like that's like the only space I could like draw it out.
[00:28:04.440] So like it's giving you a safe space to release those emotions.
[00:28:09.240] Right.
[00:28:10.240] It's like a little bit of like outward processing.
[00:28:12.579] Right.
[00:28:13.579] So like I know some people to process their emotions, they'll introspect on it and think
[00:28:17.160] a lot, but some people kind of need to talk through it.
[00:28:19.480] Right.
[00:28:20.480] Their friends and as they're talking through things like they're kind of unpacking their
[00:28:24.000] own emotions and kind of figuring out how they really feel.
[00:28:26.400] Would you say then like when you're in therapy every therapy session is an
[00:28:30.799] outburst? Dude I don't know but the last therapy session I had I came out of it
[00:28:35.680] and I was like damn that was like intense. I was like very like heightened emotions
[00:28:41.200] and stuff. A 50-minute outburst. Yeah. I think those are the ones where
[00:28:45.519] I'm like, this is well worth my money. So I've only been to one therapy session actually.
[00:28:52.559] I think I can still answer your question because I feel like in that one session I got everything
[00:28:56.960] out that I needed to. Oh my god. And then part of it was that I feel like I didn't really click
[00:29:01.519] with my therapist but the other part I was just like, I think I said why I need to say that.
[00:29:05.920] I actually feel a lot better.
[00:29:07.079] Like.
[00:29:07.920] Brian just needs a one session a year.
[00:29:10.400] Oh, wait.
[00:29:11.880] One's a lifetime.
[00:29:13.160] He's like, yo, so guess what happened
[00:29:14.880] in the past 50 years of my life?
[00:29:17.839] So when I was five.
[00:29:20.359] I think the other thing too about therapy
[00:29:22.519] is the hard thing about emotions for me
[00:29:24.599] is I always feel them, right?
[00:29:26.079] They're like bubbling under the surface
[00:29:27.720] Mm-hmm
[00:29:28.200] But I have no way to know if it's valid or not and I'm like constantly doubting of like am I being dramatic or like am I being crazy?
[00:29:34.599] Or is this like a very normal and human experience? Mm-hmm often times I'm like
[00:29:39.119] Bouncing this off of James which I've mentioned on this before, that's like not the best idea in the world.
[00:29:45.759] But because I have therapy,
[00:29:47.420] I feel like this external person is really able to either
[00:29:50.079] validate that or like check me on stuff
[00:29:52.240] that I may be overreacting on.
[00:29:55.000] So then that kind of process helps a lot.
[00:29:58.160] Like they help you regulate your emotions.
[00:30:00.640] Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:01.759] Which is kind of funny
[00:30:02.599] because there's no like real objectivity in the world,
[00:30:06.400] you know, like everything is so subjective, everything is so personal. So it's not like this one person
[00:30:11.519] can be like, yes, you're right or no, you're wrong. But it still kind of feels like that sometimes.
[00:30:16.880] You're like, am I being a normal human right now? And they're like, don't worry, you're good.
[00:30:20.400] Do I always ask that? I'm always like, is this normal? Is this normal? My therapist is like,
[00:30:24.480] okay, you need to let go of the idea that something is normal.
[00:30:28.400] I do feel like a lot of times I do feel better
[00:30:30.519] when someone validates your emotions
[00:30:32.279] or like acknowledges how you feel.
[00:30:34.640] And I feel like I do that thing too,
[00:30:36.359] where you tend to invalidate your own emotions.
[00:30:40.240] But then I feel like that contributes to the,
[00:30:42.960] it's kind of like the cycle where you'll repress your own emotions
[00:30:45.720] and because of that, like the next time it comes around again,
[00:30:48.440] you feel like a little bit worse about it than you did the last time.
[00:30:51.400] Yeah, right.
[00:30:52.160] The ball of emotion grows bigger each time.
[00:30:55.079] Also, I do think that the valid date,
[00:30:57.319] shin stuff is maybe like super common
[00:31:00.400] because I feel like whenever people share stories
[00:31:03.400] and they're like, oh my God, this is like so dramatic but blah, blah, blah, blah, then everyone at the table is like, oh my God, I feel like whenever people share stories and they're like, oh my God, this is so dramatic,
[00:31:05.480] but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:31:06.640] then everyone at the table is like,
[00:31:08.079] oh my God, I feel the same way.
[00:31:09.680] Like that totally happened to me too.
[00:31:11.400] And then it's like, oh shit,
[00:31:12.519] like everyone's experiencing this,
[00:31:14.500] but maybe we just don't talk out loud about it as much.
[00:31:17.180] So then we're all in our heads wondering,
[00:31:18.920] like am I normal?
[00:31:19.940] Is everyone else feeling this way too?
[00:31:22.000] Like just me or?
[00:31:23.440] It's true.
[00:31:24.519] I guess part of that too is, I think it's a little bit uncomfortable to acknowledge negative
[00:31:28.680] feelings sometimes.
[00:31:29.680] Like sometimes I feel like by validating myself of like, oh yeah, I'm right to be angry.
[00:31:34.160] Thereby saying my life is bad or like I'm in a bad situation when the natural thing
[00:31:38.799] in life is to want to be happy and want to be in a good situation.
[00:31:42.119] So sometimes I don't want to like acknowledge my
[00:31:45.200] misfortunes in a sense.
[00:31:47.759] Yeah, I do think that negative emotions like feel a lot more
[00:31:52.440] weighted than happy emotions.
[00:31:54.960] I wish it wasn't like that, but at least for me, I feel like I
[00:31:57.759] focus on the more pessimistic stuff to be honest.
[00:32:01.599] Yeah, I guess when I'm feeling sad or upset or whatever,
[00:32:07.039] my thought is like, why?
[00:32:08.559] Why, what's going on?
[00:32:10.240] And then I'm like investigating, but if I were happy,
[00:32:12.359] I'd just be like, oh yeah, I know I'm happy.
[00:32:14.400] Like whatever, moving on, right?
[00:32:16.359] Damn, it's like life is so simple when you're happy.
[00:32:18.799] Yeah, that's so complicated when you're not.
[00:32:20.920] I know.
[00:32:21.920] Yeah, actually I do also feel that way where like if you talk about something it doesn't
[00:32:26.640] make it feel more real sometimes.
[00:32:28.759] Have you guys ever experienced a feeling where you open up to someone?
[00:32:32.000] Maybe you don't know that well.
[00:32:33.279] And then afterwards you're just like, I think I said too much about myself or.
[00:32:36.920] Oh my god.
[00:32:37.920] Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:38.920] Yeah.
[00:32:39.920] I experienced this a lot.
[00:32:40.920] I feel like when I moved to a new city, I'm like, my friends there really, they're like pretty open.
[00:32:47.839] And like, I actually got a lot better
[00:32:49.279] about talking about like, really personal stuff with them.
[00:32:51.920] But because I hadn't been friends with them for that long,
[00:32:54.000] or I didn't know how close we were yet,
[00:32:56.000] a lot of times when I talked about like,
[00:32:57.359] the more personal or like,
[00:32:59.599] negative feelings afterwards, I'd go home like,
[00:33:01.539] dude, they probably think I'm so fucking good.
[00:33:03.839] I'm like.
[00:33:08.940] Do it scary. I feel like it's really scary to put yourself out there like that. And then sometimes in the moment, you're like, oh fuck, I already started.
[00:33:12.220] Like it's just not gonna stop. We're in this now.
[00:33:15.700] We're in the floodgates.
[00:33:16.740] I think there is a bit of power to like being able to acknowledge these things
[00:33:21.779] and openly talk about it though. For me, I feel like because it's hard for me to one, personally acknowledge that there
[00:33:28.720] are things in my life that maybe I'm not super happy about.
[00:33:31.240] And then two, being able to talk about that with other people is really hard for me.
[00:33:34.440] So then I feel like I'm constantly navigating between the numbness and the outbursts, which
[00:33:38.160] is like not the best place to be in.
[00:33:41.319] So when you feel the numbness, you just put your mind off of it?
[00:33:45.000] Yeah, I think I try to distract myself with stuff.
[00:33:49.000] For example, like, binging TV shows or getting really into something
[00:33:53.000] so that I feel like I don't have time to acknowledge things
[00:33:56.000] for you out of my life.
[00:33:57.000] Oh my god, dude, I saw some memes related to that
[00:34:01.000] where, you know how there's a lot of like really intense fans stands as we call them
[00:34:06.000] I've seen a lot of like screenshots of tweets from these people where it's like oh my god
[00:34:10.880] I went to therapy and I found out I'm just depressed so I'm like no longer obsessive about these people anymore like oh
[00:34:16.880] I'm on like medication now I'm good and I think one of the funny ones I saw was like there's like this whole group of people who
[00:34:22.599] I think one of the funny ones I saw was like, there's like this whole group of people
[00:34:24.039] who really wanna prove that Taylor Swift is bi or gay
[00:34:28.159] or something.
[00:34:29.079] So gay, learn Swift.
[00:34:30.360] Yeah.
[00:34:31.599] So one of the tweets I saw was like,
[00:34:33.880] oh my God, I found out I was depressed
[00:34:35.719] so now I'm in therapy and now I'm doing so much better.
[00:34:38.360] I don't care if Taylor Swift is gay or not,
[00:34:40.320] but I still think she is, but I don't care.
[00:34:42.400] I don't care.
[00:34:43.239] If you ask me. I still have. Like my answer is still yes but like I don't care. If you ask me.
[00:34:47.800] Like my answer is still yes, but like I don't give a shit.
[00:34:50.960] So I thought that was so funny.
[00:34:52.880] And it's kind of true, right?
[00:34:54.119] Like you're saying maybe one of our first reactions is we want to distract ourselves
[00:34:58.880] with something that we can get like really obsessive over so that we don't have to like
[00:35:02.760] deal with our emotions.
[00:35:04.159] Yeah, it's kind of like rocking a hard place.
[00:35:06.480] It's like, do I wanna feel bad emotions every day?
[00:35:09.400] Not crazy bad, but to an extent,
[00:35:11.719] do I wanna feel this every day?
[00:35:13.079] Or should I just be numb forever?
[00:35:15.760] I see.
[00:35:16.599] I mean, I'm making this sound very dramatic.
[00:35:19.320] I don't think my swings are that crazy,
[00:35:22.360] but I think this is hopefully relatable to people.
[00:35:25.639] It's just like, sometimes I just don't wanna be sad.
[00:35:28.400] Yeah.
[00:35:29.239] Okay, but also on the flip side,
[00:35:30.760] do you ever have like happy outbursts?
[00:35:33.199] No, just kidding.
[00:35:34.800] But I think probably.
[00:35:38.519] I think definitely, but I can't think of anything right now.
[00:35:42.760] It's been a long 20.
[00:35:44.239] Oh my God, actually, I definitely do get them.
[00:35:48.599] So I'm like a socially anxious extrovert.
[00:35:51.480] So I feel like I get really, really happy
[00:35:53.079] when I'm surrounded by friends and like people I love.
[00:35:56.000] That was the same case for me during my childhood too, right?
[00:35:58.880] So I have this distinct memory where I went to go watch
[00:36:02.239] some sort of movie with like my church friends
[00:36:04.440] and like their parents. So we were all like standing outside the theater and I was
[00:36:07.519] so happy. Like I was like high on the happiness of like friendship and we were
[00:36:11.880] running around outside the theater screaming. Like you know how kids just
[00:36:15.159] screamed they're so happy. So we were screaming and my dad like grabbed my hand
[00:36:18.480] he was like don't outburst in public. Like you need to regulate your emotions.
[00:36:22.920] Like in Korean it's like to DigiMife, like that's kind of what the translation is,
[00:36:26.139] like don't be so light and like don't be so crazy basically.
[00:36:31.519] I like always think about that actually.
[00:36:33.519] I'm always like, okay, I need to like not be so
[00:36:36.760] up in the air in like my happiness.
[00:36:40.039] Do so maybe the solution is we all need to not hold back
[00:36:43.920] our happy outburst, but we should hold back our sad outburst.
[00:36:47.519] Should we scream out of play?
[00:36:49.440] I don't know.
[00:36:51.400] When I think of happy outburst, maybe it's just
[00:36:53.619] bursting out into a fit of laughter with friends
[00:36:56.800] when you can't hold it in anymore.
[00:36:58.639] Maybe that's one of the most basic versions.
[00:37:00.800] Yeah, I feel like definitely being surrounded by friends
[00:37:03.800] does give me that like burst of
[00:37:05.239] joy.
[00:37:06.239] Mm hmm.
[00:37:07.239] On the topic of happy outbursts, we kind of talked about how negative emotions can sometimes
[00:37:11.440] feel more weighted.
[00:37:12.639] Right.
[00:37:13.639] Do you think the long term impact of a happy outburst is different from like the long term
[00:37:18.960] impact of a sad outburst or a mad outburst?
[00:37:22.239] Actually yes.
[00:37:23.239] Because like Brian mentioned towards the beginning of the episode,
[00:37:26.019] like sometimes you have an outburst and you think about it later, right?
[00:37:29.119] You're like, oh, should I have done that?
[00:37:31.699] You know, like 10 years later we're up in the middle of the night.
[00:37:35.500] Like, oh my gosh, I said that one.
[00:37:37.000] I was like 12 years old.
[00:37:39.820] But like, happy outburst is kind of like, okay, that happened.
[00:37:43.139] Like we can't even think of happy out first we had.
[00:37:45.500] For sure.
[00:37:46.500] Oh, that's so true.
[00:37:47.500] Yeah.
[00:37:48.000] I guess because happiness isn't something you have to resolve.
[00:37:50.699] Like, I feel like negative emotions always feels like there needs to be a solution or like some sort of way out.
[00:37:55.500] But happiness is like, it's fine.
[00:37:56.900] It's just like, it's already solved.
[00:37:59.000] Yeah.
[00:37:59.500] It's like a passive.
[00:38:00.500] Yeah.
[00:38:01.300] I feel like angry or like frustration out first when you think of that event or like the whole day,
[00:38:06.679] that's like the first thing you think of. But for happy
[00:38:09.119] uppers, I feel like I can't think of any right now because I
[00:38:12.079] just remember that general like period of time where like I
[00:38:14.320] felt very happy or like that memory. And then there was
[00:38:18.119] probably like a happy uppers in there. But I'm just kind of
[00:38:20.280] remembering like how I fell in the moment rather than like some
[00:38:23.280] cringy thing.
[00:38:25.559] I feel like for me happy outbursts feel a lot more physical.
[00:38:29.280] I can actually feel the rush of my heart if I try to recall a happy outbursts.
[00:38:33.380] It's the kind of feeling that makes you want to skip outside.
[00:38:37.159] I feel it a lot like the first day of traveling or the first day of a friendship.
[00:38:40.880] I'm like, oh my god, my heart is swelling.
[00:38:42.800] Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:44.000] That's a good one. The first day of travel is pretty exciting.
[00:38:47.280] But then if you're put on the spot,
[00:38:48.719] like, yo, tell me when was your last happy outburst?
[00:38:51.559] You're like, cool.
[00:38:52.400] You feel like when I was a kid,
[00:38:53.239] my dad told me to stop.
[00:38:54.559] Oh, yeah.
[00:38:55.559] But the first and last happy outburst.
[00:38:59.320] Oh my god.
[00:39:03.440] Well, one thing that someone said to me was that another reason why negative emotions feel
[00:39:09.340] so much more weighted now is because our frontal lobes are developed.
[00:39:14.719] She was like, yeah, you now can weigh pros and cons and you can like see farther the
[00:39:21.480] results of each choice.
[00:39:23.960] So that's why there's more stress in your life.
[00:39:27.199] And I was like, can I ungrow it?
[00:39:30.199] Yeah.
[00:39:31.199] How do I reduce it?
[00:39:36.440] Yeah, I mean, definitely, I think emotions in our late 20s
[00:39:40.519] feel a lot different than emotions when we were younger.
[00:39:43.719] I guess the positive is that it doesn't feel as intense anymore.
[00:39:46.800] I think if I recall my high school era,
[00:39:49.400] everything felt like such high stakes,
[00:39:51.280] even though looking back, it kind of wasn't really.
[00:39:53.880] Nowadays, the decisions we're making on a day-to-day basis
[00:39:57.239] are bigger in size, but I feel like less crazy emotional about it.
[00:40:02.320] So that I'm grateful for.
[00:40:03.880] I think in another sense, it can sort of feel like life is duller.
[00:40:08.519] So then to feel emotions, again, you have to do things like watch a sad TV show or like go on a vacation.
[00:40:13.679] So you're like inducing it sort of more intensely.
[00:40:17.559] I guess it's because like our emotions are more nuanced now.
[00:40:20.599] And then we've also experienced more.
[00:40:23.239] So we recognize it a little faster but then like a lot
[00:40:26.639] of it happens so it's like a lot of small things versus like when we're kids like one thing is the
[00:40:33.119] world you're like oh my god this person took my toy like it's the end of the world.
[00:40:40.159] I kind of missed that feeling like there's something about being a teenager listening to like, I don't know, punk rock.
[00:40:45.960] Because I have a co-roak.
[00:40:46.960] Yeah.
[00:40:47.960] And feeling that feeling of it's me against the world.
[00:40:51.000] Like I feel like there's no such high like that.
[00:40:54.079] For sure.
[00:40:54.920] I think life was a lot simpler back then.
[00:40:56.199] So when you like reflect on it, it seems a little bit silly
[00:40:59.480] almost how hard you reacted to things.
[00:41:01.440] And now I think there's objectively a lot more pressure
[00:41:03.880] like in your late 20s,
[00:41:05.639] than there probably was when you were in middle school.
[00:41:08.519] So you kind of missed like the simplicity
[00:41:10.239] and how much easier things were back then.
[00:41:12.880] Yeah.
[00:41:13.719] Dude, like imagine your 10 year old self
[00:41:16.320] living the life you live right now.
[00:41:18.119] Oh my God.
[00:41:19.519] Like what they have.
[00:41:20.360] Crumble.
[00:41:21.199] Like breakdowns every other, every 30 minutes.
[00:41:25.320] I think to an extent now,
[00:41:28.239] I almost feel like the lack of stress
[00:41:30.559] is also an emotion for me.
[00:41:33.079] It's like if you feel work stress every single day,
[00:41:35.400] then sometimes I'm grateful for weekends,
[00:41:37.159] not because I'm gonna be extremely happy and ecstatic
[00:41:39.599] on the weekend, but just because I will be less stressed.
[00:41:42.719] Turn off your brain kind of like, just relax.
[00:41:45.280] Agreed.
[00:41:46.159] So maybe we have a gotten better at emotional regulation,
[00:41:49.360] but since it's so incremental, we don't realize it.
[00:41:52.079] Until now we're reflecting back, we're like,
[00:41:54.079] oh yeah, this one thing was the end of the world
[00:41:56.719] when I was 10 years old,
[00:41:58.239] but now it's such a brush off thing.
[00:42:01.920] Do you think you have measures that maybe you didn't even
[00:42:06.800] realize that you used to prevent outbursts,
[00:42:10.280] whether it be happy or sad?
[00:42:12.480] I think I mentioned therapy earlier,
[00:42:14.920] so that's probably like the biggest way
[00:42:16.920] I've been trying to manage my emotions a little bit more.
[00:42:20.360] I think also verbalizing feelings helps a lot for me.
[00:42:24.320] So putting things that are abstract,
[00:42:26.179] like thoughts and feelings into like physical words
[00:42:28.760] in itself is very therapeutic for me.
[00:42:31.280] And the other thing that I've been doing,
[00:42:33.079] I've been trying to channel all my emotions,
[00:42:35.400] especially the negative ones during exercise.
[00:42:37.880] So I've been going on what I call rage runs.
[00:42:40.239] Oh my God.
[00:42:41.079] And it's been helping so much
[00:42:42.039] because the entire time I'm like fantasizing
[00:42:43.679] about something that I feel like is very frustrating or like weighing on me.
[00:42:47.360] And because I'm releasing it in both my thoughts
[00:42:49.800] and also physically, I think it's been helping me a little bit.
[00:42:54.920] A valid actually.
[00:42:55.880] I think exercise is good for it.
[00:42:57.320] Yeah.
[00:42:57.820] Release is endorphins too.
[00:42:58.639] Dude, highly recommend Rage Run.
[00:43:01.920] R&R, Rage and brain gen running R and R.
[00:43:05.519] I do also think about how your dad was like,
[00:43:09.480] you must become a home.
[00:43:11.000] You know, I didn't even realize
[00:43:13.360] that was like a personal trauma for me,
[00:43:14.719] but I think it actually led.
[00:43:17.320] Just came out today.
[00:43:19.760] I agree with the exercise thing.
[00:43:21.119] Like, Jimming is, it's really therapeutic.
[00:43:23.840] You're just kind of like letting out all your angry energy kind of. So I don't do it every time. I think
[00:43:29.559] one that really works well for me. I'm not consistent with it because I don't have like
[00:43:34.480] consistently have Alpurs either. But um, like when something's like really bothering me,
[00:43:40.280] I found that journaling actually helps a lot. It's kind of the same feeling as like vent like venting to someone, but you know, sometimes you don't want to like talk about this stuff
[00:43:48.960] with other people or you're like, you're gonna think I'm like crazy. So sometimes I just like
[00:43:53.920] start journaling and I don't really know where I'm going with it, but that's kind of the part
[00:43:57.360] where you're like unpacking and I honestly feel like a lot better after I do it. So that's something
[00:44:02.719] that's like working pretty well for me. Nice.
[00:44:05.760] That's a good one.
[00:44:06.599] Yeah, I think I've also done journaling
[00:44:08.960] in like high emotional moments as well.
[00:44:12.159] And it definitely kind of helps.
[00:44:13.639] It's also kind of interesting to look back on it sometimes
[00:44:16.280] and you're like, oh my God, I remember the emotions
[00:44:18.440] I was feeling.
[00:44:20.280] I remember what happened to you.
[00:44:22.559] Another thing that I sometimes do
[00:44:24.840] for emotional management, I guess, is
[00:44:28.000] I really sit with the emotion.
[00:44:30.320] So sometimes, if I'm sad, I'm like, okay, I guess I'll just embrace it.
[00:44:34.239] I'll just lie in bed, I'll play some sad music, and then I'll listen to it.
[00:44:37.440] I'll be like, okay.
[00:44:38.960] Oh, I did it too, actually.
[00:44:41.199] Yeah.
[00:44:41.760] It's like wallowing in your face.
[00:44:43.039] Yeah.
[00:44:43.519] It is, like, but then it passes.
[00:44:44.880] Exactly. Is it a two actually? Yeah, it's like wallowing in your face. It is like, but then it passes.
[00:44:45.000] Exactly.
[00:44:46.280] So instead of maybe running away from it
[00:44:48.559] or trying to distract yourself from it,
[00:44:50.639] just kind of like wallowing in it.
[00:44:52.079] And then I guess sometimes the feeling is,
[00:44:54.679] oh, it's actually not that bad, you know?
[00:44:56.239] Like, passes a bit.
[00:44:57.679] And then you're like, okay, I guess sad hour's over.
[00:45:01.360] Yeah, I think that does help
[00:45:02.440] because you're not like compartmentalizing it.
[00:45:05.239] You're actually somewhat focusing on it a little bit and processing it.
[00:45:08.400] So because you're not just like shoving it to the side,
[00:45:11.320] it does pass a little bit like smoother resolution.
[00:45:14.719] But I feel like you guys have a point with anger.
[00:45:17.519] Anger kind of builds up energy.
[00:45:19.440] So you want to like do something.
[00:45:21.599] Exercising is probably a good route for that.
[00:45:24.199] But I don't have too many things
[00:45:25.699] that trigger huge rage in me yet.
[00:45:28.659] So I'll let you know when I have to take an hour.
[00:45:32.460] Actually, I think for me,
[00:45:35.219] this episode recording in itself
[00:45:37.420] has been very much a expression of my emotions.
[00:45:41.500] And it's also kind of nice to take a more meta look
[00:45:44.539] at how we do talk about and think about my emotions. And it's also kind of nice to take like a more meta look at like how we do talk about and think about our emotions.
[00:45:47.719] And I feel like it's been very validating to hear that.
[00:45:50.119] Both of you guys go through these highs and lows,
[00:45:52.679] which I feel like is very normal and human.
