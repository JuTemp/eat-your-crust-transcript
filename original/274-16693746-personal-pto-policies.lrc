[00:00:00.000] Welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Jeesoo and I'm Crystal. Today's topic is everybody's favorite thing at work, I think, and that is PTO, so pay time off, and all of the unspoken rules that come with taking PTO. I feel like on a surface level,
[00:00:30.180] PTO is unproblematic, like you're just taking some time off and you've earned it, right? Every paycheck you've earned a couple of hours to put towards your future vacations, but there's some weird, silent, unspoken rules that come with taking PTO that I feel like you really start to know and feel the longer you work at your company. Right now, we'll talk about earned PTO,
[00:00:54.540] because we both don't have unlimited PTO, so we can't speak too much to that, but I totally agree that there's definitely a feeling of, I've earned this PTO, so you can't just like take it away from me or deny me. And I think for the most part, that's usually the case, but you're right, there's definitely moments where you're like, oh, maybe I shouldn't have taken PTO in this moment, or like
[00:01:20.700] this particular time is a bad time and it could make me look bad if I'm like forcing my way into PTO. Totally. And that actually brings up something funny. So I've had a couple of bosses in my career so far, and one of the bosses that I had, we were on a very small team. It was basically my boss and me. So anytime either of us took PTO, we would want there to be coverage within the team. So taking PTO was,
[00:01:50.740] of course, a earned right, but it was also something that required a little bit of coordination. Like, hey, I'm going to take this time off. Does that work with you? How does that fit with like our team's goals for the year? So I was very used to having an open communication about it with my boss. But a little bit later in my career, I had a different boss. And at the time that this boss became my boss, our team had since grown. So there are multiple people on the team, a little bit better PTO coverage,
[00:02:17.080] I would say. So maybe a little bit less coordination required. And I remember once I was like, hey, I'm thinking of taking these days off. Is that cool with you? If so, I'll like put it into the system for approval. And that boss was like, oh, I'm not used to people asking me for like permission to take PTO, which I thought was an interesting comment. Because in my head, I was like, I guess you could take it as like, I'm asking for permission. But really what it is, is the team
[00:02:43.880] going to be okay if I take this PTO. And that was something that was so ingrained into me with my smaller team experience. Yeah. So since then, I'm kind of like, I guess I should word it less so like, oh, is it cool if I take this time off and more like, I'm going to submit this, let me know if there's anything you need me to do beforehand, so that it doesn't seem as permission. But at the same time, I was just like, bruh, like, let's be real. There are kind of permissions that come with
[00:03:09.220] like asking for time off. A little bit. I think I'm similar to your first situation where my team that has similar function with me, so my more immediate team is definitely smaller. So, you know, if I'm on PTO, and my boss is on PTO, it might be a rough time for people who need like
[00:03:30.300] design help. Right. But yeah, I think what I do do is I really take note of when we have events coming up at work, or we know that stretch of time might be busy time. And usually I won't schedule any PTO during that time. And I usually try to just do it towards like the end of the year, or when I know it'll be a little more chill, especially if it's like right after a big event
[00:03:59.860] or a big deadline. Those are like optimal times because usually it's a little more chill. You just cleared your plate of all your tasks. And it's a good refresher, I think. I think you're right in that like there's key weeks that are better for taking PTO and key weeks that maybe aren't as appropriate. There are definitely some important months in my current job where I'm like, okay, I should probably try not to take vacation on these times. But another thing that
[00:04:27.180] I noticed is oftentimes parents will sort of be forced to take PTO like at the same time. So like during spring break or some of vacation, I know a lot of parents kind of have to keep their kids entertained. So then for me, if a lot of people on my team who are like parents have to take these times off, it's probably best if I don't take that time off, if I can avoid it. That way there's like someone on
[00:04:51.700] our team who's kind of able to answer questions or whatnot. Wait, that's so true. Especially if someone's a parent and their kid gets sick, then they like usually have to take PTO. Right. Or if there's just like any sort of complication with these kids, I feel like it's a whole added element. Luckily on my team though, I think there's only like two or three people in my bigger team
[00:05:16.780] who have kids. So there's like less just random needed PTO that's being taken. But I'm like, dude, it's tough. I see sometimes they're like, oh my God, it's like six season. My kid got sick. So I'm going to stay home this week because I don't want to like spread the sickness or I'm going to have to like take PTO this day because I need to take my kid to the doctor. I'm like, wow, it's like double work for them.
[00:05:41.080] Wait, holy shit. This is like low-key blowing my mind because to me, PTO is so vacation focused. I'm like, oh, which state or like which country do I want to be in when I take my 20 days off this year or whatever. But you're so right. Like when someone is a parent, it's not really your time. It's like time that you have to allocate for your family. And that kind of like, I don't know, it takes the sparkle away from it a little bit.
[00:06:07.400] Dude, don't worry. My coworkers who do have kids, they mostly do take PTO still for vacation. But I think there's just like the occasional one or two where it's like, hey, I'm sick. So I'm going to stay home today or like kids sick and like don't want to spread the germs. It's usually still vacation. So don't worry. I would say the ratio is probably like 95 to like 5%. Okay. You got me a little scared for a sec. I was like, oh no, my vacation.
[00:06:39.860] I think the good thing is that right now, like work is relatively flexible with working from home and coming into the office. And I think at least my team is very, very understanding. We're mostly a team of women. So we have a lot of trust and a lot of understanding between us all. So it's like, oh, if you know, she has to go take care of her kid, totally get it, blah, blah, blah. I guess that's
[00:07:06.200] like another part of the whole PTO thing, right? Like if you build up a good relationship with your team, with your boss, and you have a lot of trust, then it's a little easier to have to take last minute PTO if something happens. Or maybe you take a lot of PTO, then it's like easier for them to understand what's going on with you if you actually have a relationship with them.
[00:07:32.220] Oh, yeah. I kind of see it more like it depends on the work that you do. If you're doing a lot of time sensitive, super critical effects, all these, you know, it's like a dependency for all these other teams or whatever, then I feel like maybe there's more rules and more structure. Luckily, I feel like certain companies in tech or like certain teams, even within these companies do tend to be more chill
[00:07:55.660] and more flexible. So I feel like it's easier to take longer weeks off or maybe close consecutive weeks of PTO off if you are a part of like a more chill team. But I know I've definitely been on teams where it's like, oh, even when you're off, you kind of like check your phone and things like that. So that's not super pleasant. Yeah, that's very true. I think I'm very lucky that my team is all
[00:08:20.540] very encouraging of taking your proper vacation. They're like, please don't check your phone. We've got you covered. Don't bring your laptop, all of that kind of stuff. And I'm like, wow, that's like very admirable. And I like that we can support each other like that. And we have the trust to do that. Yeah, I think I personally, though, still bring my work phone with me just in case, just in
[00:08:44.240] case there's emergencies. Yeah. Also, to clarify, the trust I mean here is that I can trust my team members to pick up any emergencies that might happen. I bring my phone just in case. But realistically, I probably don't ever have to do anything. Because if you know, a last minute project were to come in while I'm on PTO, I know my team members would be able to handle it. That's such a good point. And I
[00:09:10.980] actually think that's a part of PTO hygiene almost to of like setting your team up for success while you take PTO. And it might vary when I was like a very entry level, like junior level employee, really the PTO coverage that I had wouldn't be significant, right? It's like, oh, here's like this minor task I was working on. Here are some notes about it if anyone asks. But truly, like the longer you are
[00:09:35.880] at a company or on a team, and the bigger your responsibilities grow, I feel like you do kind of have to write stuff down, instruct people on like, okay, if this comes in, here's what you would do. My learning in the last couple of years is to like write a PTO doc. Here's my recurring tasks that I would do on what day, going to people and like assigning them to be the point person for that task. And then also just like sharing that doc out to the relevant people and also to my manager,
[00:10:03.800] so that she knows, okay, this person is taking on Monday reporting, like this person is taking on Wednesday reporting, so that everyone is kind of in the loop. Oh my god, yours is like more intense than my prep. I'm just like, hey boss, I'll be gone. I think I finished all my work, but this person might email you about this and I let them know that I'll be gone. Hey, that's PTO hygiene right there.
[00:10:31.060] But there was one time where I felt really bad. It was actually us. We had a planned vacation one year, you, me, and a couple of our other friends. We had planned it, maybe it was like a year or half a year in advance, but then an event came up at my job. And it was like right after our vacation. And I was like, oh my god. And at that time, I was the only designer. I was freaking
[00:10:59.220] out a little bit because there were like two thoughts going on. One is like, well, this vacation was planned a long time ago, so it's not like we could just cancel it and it's not just me. And I let my boss at the time know that she was very understanding. But the other part of me was like, oh no, but I don't want to just leave the team to their own devices for one and a half to two weeks,
[00:11:22.220] especially because I was the only designer at the time. So what I did was I told my boss at the time that I would take a couple half days so that I could make sure that we're on track to still complete our stuff by the event. But then what really worked out was that we were in the process of hiring another designer who would eventually be my senior designer. And they joined right before or maybe it was like
[00:11:50.200] right during our vacation. And I was like, oh, perfect. Like there is someone to cover. But I felt a bit bad because they're just joined. So they were like getting thrown into the deep end of doing stuff. But it ended up all working out. And then ever since then, our team has been better about announcing when these kinds of events would happen because that was the first time that it happened. So it was announced a little later. And I was like, oh my God, I didn't know to expect this.
[00:12:17.520] That's always rough when something really urgent comes up last minute and you're just like, how am I supposed to tackle all of this before my vacation? Because I'm still going on that vacation. Yeah. I don't know if you feel this way, but I feel like for me, the week before I take a week or two off is always like the craziest week because I'm going to all my coworkers and, you know, doing that whole PTO coverage spiel, but also because I want to handle all of my work and get it really wrapped up before I go.
[00:12:45.280] That week is already busy, but I've had times where something really urgent comes up and I've had to work till like 1 a.m. or something the night before my vacation while also trying to pack at the same time. So one of the things that I've noticed that some of my coworkers will do is a couple of weeks before they go on vacation. If they're like a very external facing person, they'll put in their
[00:13:09.080] signature of the email expecting to go on PTO 221 to 36 will have limited email during that time. And then of course you also do the auto reply when you're out on PTO to be like, okay, if your question is about X, Y, and Z, email this person. If it's about ABC, email this other person. So I was like, okay, it's kind of nice to like let everyone know beforehand that you're going on PTO.
[00:13:33.520] That's a good idea. Putting in your signature upcoming PTO. One thing that I have started doing is I send out like a weekly newsletter to one of my main stakeholders. So I usually share in there, oh, upcoming PTO or like dates that I won't be available, which I think is pretty helpful. But the auto responder vacation responder is like so crucial. Well, I don't know. I think
[00:14:00.700] cause I haven't had any like real emergencies come up while I'm in PTO. It's always fine, but I guess it's just the fact that it's like letting people know who are reaching out to you. Like, Hey, I'll be back later. Yeah. Yeah. But one time I almost forgot to set it and I didn't bring my work laptop with me. And I was like, oh my God, can you set this thing from your phone? And luckily you could, but yeah, I was like, oh God, I need to set this right now or else what
[00:14:27.700] if people email me? I feel like you also have to remember to turn it off if you didn't set the dates correctly, for example, or like if you just forget to like toggle one thing. I've gotten emails back from people where they're like, I'll be back in office on this date. And I'm like, wait, that date was like three days ago. You're back in office. Yeah. That's funny. That's actually one of my biggest fears. I'm like, what if I set the dates wrong? And like my emails don't send or like
[00:14:51.520] my emails don't stop sending. Right. But honestly, PTO coverage aside, do you have any personal guardrails on like how much PTO is too much PTO or like how much vacation is too long of a vacation or anything like that? I definitely do. I try not to take more than two weeks of PTO at a time
[00:15:13.340] for vacation purposes. So that's like 10 work days, five each week. And then if you can tag on like a holiday and then that way you can save one of your PTO days. So for example, in February, there was like President's Day. If you could take PTO and tag that on, it would be like kind of nice. But yeah, generally I try not to take more than two weeks for vacation purposes. And I also try not
[00:15:39.400] to take PTO too close together. So like if I took two weeks in say March or something, I probably would not try to take long PTO anything a week or longer for at least two or three months just personally. Wait, really? I feel like you took so much PTO last year.
[00:16:01.600] I know, but it was because it was all very separated. So I took two weeks, I think it was either two or one and a half weeks in March. And then the next time I took PTO was in November. Oh, it's because when I travel. Oh, you were? Yeah. When I travel domestically, I usually don't take PTO because
[00:16:28.120] if I'm traveling domestically, like the hours are about the same. And if I'm hanging out with friends, they probably still have work on the weekdays too. So I'm like, okay, I might as well just keep working and like get stuff done, you know, not fall behind if there's no reason to take this PTO. And then also my company usually has offices in like major cities. So I think that's another pro because I can still go into the office if needed. Yeah. I feel like it's definitely really helpful
[00:16:57.480] when your company has like a more flexible RTO policy or you're able to do that stuff remotely versus if you do have strict RTO policy, then it's harder to take those domestic PTO days. Yeah. But that is really nice. Then you save so much vacation time. I think I have similar rules as you, but it's hard. I feel like the older I'm getting, the harder it is to like adhere to these things because a lot of the times vacation might not be
[00:17:22.960] around my volition anymore. I might be coordinating with like a bunch of other people's schedules, especially for things like weddings and whatnot. It's up to the couple, right? To like really set the date and the location. I'm realizing it's like harder and harder to try to spread it out if it's based on someone else's plans. Yeah. But yeah, I think two and a half weeks is like the max for me. And if it's longer than that, then hopefully I'm like more tenured and feel
[00:17:51.820] more comfortable booking longer PTO. Cause I think that's also, you know, the longer you're at a company and like the more PTO coverage you've picked up for someone else, I think it's easier to ask for longer vacation days in a row. But if you've been at a company for a shorter amount of time, it feels a little bad to ask for a really long vacation off, even if you have the hours. Oh, for sure. I think that's another, I guess, like personal rule. If I'm new to a team or company,
[00:18:19.600] I try not to take PTO for at least the first six months or so, because I feel like there's two big reasons. One is like, this is already pretty chill time and you're usually spending maybe the first couple of weeks to a month ramping up, learning your role, getting to meet the people around you, your stakeholders, your teammates. And that's like pretty valuable time, you know, learning and being
[00:18:46.580] at the company. And then after that, you're, you're just like getting into the flow and I think kind of building a routine almost. So I think it's like a pretty good time to just stay there and it's not like too stressful. Hopefully you're building up your relationships. So I feel like it's a pretty important time to stay. And I think it also, well, I don't know, this is just me, but I feel like the
[00:19:11.340] perception is that maybe it looks bad if you join an immediate, you're like, oh, I planned this vacation to take in like three weeks. Bye guys. Unless of course it was like a previously planned, like, I'm so sorry, everyone like already had this plan. I think that's a little different. It's definitely one of those things where I feel like I would also maybe like slightly judge someone if they joined and then suddenly was jet setting across the world, taking like multiple weeks off.
[00:19:40.160] It's like one of those things where you wish you could be like the chill person. But I think if you just don't know someone well enough, that's just kind of what happens. So then like you, I also try to be mindful of that. Towing the balance of min-maxing PTO for the first couple of months. Yeah. And I think it probably also really depends on your team because I'm sure there's definitely a lot of teams who might not care. They might be like, oh yeah, this is really good downtime to take some
[00:20:06.020] vacation. So go ahead if you want to. But I feel like definitely just kind of like feel out the vibes. Yeah. And also you probably just don't have many hours to spend anyway. Oh, that's so true. Yeah. Of course the case is very different if you have unlimited PTO, but I just don't have experience in that field. Yeah. Question for you. Have you ever experienced the opposite where you suddenly realize like, damn, I'm like not taking enough PTO? Not yet.
[00:20:37.060] For some reason, I've been like making international trips towards the end of the year for the past three years or so. Usually when I do those bigger international trips, I take about two weeks of PTO. And so, so far I've not like hit the ceiling where they're like, oh, your PTO days are capped. Like you need to take some time off. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.
[00:21:01.680] Yeah. I feel like recently I've been taking a ton of PTO, but I will say COVID years, my workload was super heavy and also people weren't really traveling at that time, right? Just health wise. So I remember those years, there were definitely some moments where I was like, oh my God, even if I don't go anywhere, I need to take a day off. This is too much work. I'm working late hours. Sometimes I was even working on like weekends.
[00:21:28.400] Oh my God. So yeah, I feel like there are moments in life where you just look up and you're like, I have a lot of PTO in the bank. Like I should spend it. And that's something that I've had to come to terms with too. Sometimes I have like a hoarder's mentality with like PTO where I'm like, oh my precious PTO, like I need to save this for whatever international trip. But I realized like sometimes if you really need a day, it's worth taking it even if you don't really do anything or go
[00:21:55.620] anywhere. I'm also definitely hoarder mentality for my PTO. I mean, I've said that I take like vacation and I'll take PTO for that. But literally if I cannot take PTO, I will not take it. Like for example, the domestic traveling, I'm like, why would I take PTO for this? I should just save, you know? So I totally get that. And you're so right in the regular day to day. I don't really think,
[00:22:19.180] oh, maybe I'm super burnt out. I should just take a Friday off or something. But when you like step back and look at the big picture, it's kind of like, oh, maybe that would help. And it's like always interesting because I think when you're really, really busy at work, there's obviously so much work that needs to get done. Even just workload wise, like the last thing I'm thinking is, oh, I should take some time off because then you have less hours to put towards
[00:22:47.480] that project or whatever you're trying to accomplish before the deadline. I always find it to be sort of like a catch 22. I know this day off will really help, but that's also eight less hours that I could put towards like finishing something. Yeah. I don't know what the right answer is for that. You know, what I've seen is people just save their PTO and then they get an email that says like,
[00:23:12.540] hey, your PTO is like full, so you need to take a day off before your next paycheck. And so they're like, okay, I guess I'm forced to take a rest day, a day off. And then they're like, that was kind of nice. So that's what I've seen. Maybe you don't have to actively think about it and you just wait for that email to come. I think this year I have the opposite problem. I've been like running my PTO
[00:23:38.940] balance down to zero. So it's crazy out here. You know, there's always that period of time. I think it's like July to August where you're like, oh, August has no long weekends. And then you start to think about like, when is the next long weekend coming? After the beginning of September into October, that's also like a little low of like no long weekends. And I think those are the times where
[00:24:06.300] I do seriously consider a little bit, oh, there's no long weekends. Should I just make myself one? And then it depends on how busy you are and how in need of that PTO you feel. But you're right. If you're really busy, you're kind of like, there's no time to take PTO right now. But do you ever think of it like, oh, if you get through this busy hump, you can reward yourself with like a day off? I think I've definitely felt that way with closing a big project or something.
[00:24:34.480] But I also think it very much depends on your field of work. There are certain fields of work where there's no chill season. It's like a lot of recurring tasks, a lot of things that need to be done. I think especially if anyone has worked in like supply chain or operations, the grind doesn't really stop. So then in that field, I don't know if I like really felt like there was that much of a chill time. Or if there was a chill time, it would be for like a week of the month. And then it would
[00:25:02.500] like go back into that grind. But I think I know what you mean about when there's not a ton of true like holiday baked in, I start to really crave PTO. Yeah. And that's actually the privilege that we have as people who aren't parents yet of, oh, I can just like take a day off on like a random weekend in October. Like I don't have to adhere to like Labor Day weekend, Memorial Day weekend, where all
[00:25:27.700] the vacation spots are so crowded already. We can kind of choose a chill weekend to go and travel somewhere. Oh, that's so true. I think one of my coworkers who has a daughter, she is taking next week off because they're going to go to Disneyland. And I was like, oh my god, it might be. Well, actually, I think right now it's okay-ish. But I was like, a couple weeks from now, it could be like busy spring break season, you know. But I think for them, it's like ski week maybe. So I'm like,
[00:25:55.160] wait, it might also still be busy. Like they're just, you're right, they're forced to follow a certain schedule. Yeah. I'm like honestly counting down the years where we are still not parents and we can like do these things. I'm like, how many more Octobers can we actually travel? But I have a couple of funny questions for you logistically. Okay. So we talked a lot about like planning for
[00:26:19.540] PTO, the appropriate number of days you can take off, that kind of stuff. But at the end of the day, when you take time off, you have to put it into the system. Right. And you have to put it into your calendar as well. So question number one, you are trying to take some time off and it's not yet set in stone, but you go to like block the days off on your calendar and you see that multiple people on
[00:26:42.380] your team are taking that exact week off. What do you do? Okay. Well, it depends. Am I taking this PTO because I'm vacationing or just like for fun? You're thinking, oh, maybe I should just take a trip to Hawaii, like some random weekend. And you haven't booked anything yet, but you check the calendar. So if it's holiday season or like, I know it's kind of more like chill season, maybe it's right after a big event or something. Dude, the more people taking PTO, the better.
[00:27:12.480] But if it's busy season, then I'll think twice about it. I'll be like, oh shoot, these people are going to be preoccupied by whatever is happening in their personal lives. Maybe I'll move my trip out by like a week or something. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like for me too, if it's like last two weeks of December, I'm like, you know, everyone's going to be off, like no biggie. But if it's on like a random
[00:27:37.940] week, I'd be like, okay, I probably can't take this time off. It's kind of like first come first serve to a certain extent, I think. Yeah. I guess it's like, you have to like survey the situation a little more if more people are taking PTO. But what's really funny is like last year, last two weeks of December, it just so happened that almost everyone on my team took PTO, whether it was for travel, for like family time. I don't really remember, but I was like, wow,
[00:28:06.000] this year in particular, there's more people taking PTO. So I was like, okay, I'm just not going to take PTO because I wasn't traveling and it'll be chill anyway. If I took PTO, it would be a waste. So that's my hoarder mentality right there. I've definitely felt that way too. Yeah. It's going to be a chill week already. Like I can kind of catch up on old tasks, maybe work a little slower than usual. There's going to be less urgent stuff. So that in itself is already like very chill.
[00:28:33.820] Right. And you could spend that time. Like, I think I ended up spending that time prepping for the new year and like doing some of those trainings that I always forget to do. I actually maybe contrary to what the common vacation time is. Like I actually rarely ever take December PTO if I can help it. I feel that as well. Okay. Question number two, you are booking an international trip. Say it's like
[00:29:02.600] two weeks overseas or something, but you're booking it pretty far in advance. So say you're booking it like 12 months in advance. How early do you book that PTO into the system? Okay. So wait, this is actually kind of funny. I don't know why, but I don't love putting PTO into the official system too early. So what I've started to put into practice is I'll just book those
[00:29:32.300] weeks out on my team calendar first. I'll just put in like crystal out of office and then I won't officially put it into the system until maybe like at most six months out. But I'll usually give my manager a heads up. Hey, I planned this vacation for this time. And she'll be like, okay. Okay. I think I'm very similar to you too. I will wait till it's like about the six month mark and then
[00:30:00.200] I'll put it into the system. I guess the only exception is if I know that period is like super, super busy, I'll probably give it a little bit more notice. Or if I know I'll truly be like unreachable during that time or something, I'll start to like pepper it into conversations. Like, oh my God, I'm so excited. Like I booked this vacation and just keep reminding people about it. So it's not like a surprise when I entered into the system, but I don't know why I feel so bad
[00:30:26.640] to book it really early. Yeah. I don't know either. Part of it though, I don't want to like use up my PTO. What if I have some random in between PTO that I want to use? And I'm like, oh shoot, I just like spent all that PTO on that two weeks. Oh, I see. Yeah. But now that I'm thinking about it, it doesn't even matter because if I spent it all, it's still accruing every couple of weeks. Right.
[00:30:51.740] So I guess that's actually not logically anything, but I don't know. It just feels like it. Yeah. It kind of feels like I'm like showing all my cards or something, you know, like I'm like burying all my PTO out there being PTO vulnerable. Oh my God. PTO vulnerable. Oh my God. Okay. I also, I have a problem because I feel so bad saying no to meetings.
[00:31:20.220] I always just say yes. And if I'm not sure, I just like don't respond. So you know how like the out of office thing, it automatically just says no to all your meetings. Yeah. Dude, I said it so that it does not. Oh, cause you're like, I don't want to say no to this meeting, even though I literally am not working. I'm like, I don't want to just announce to everyone that I'm
[00:31:45.860] out of office this day. Dude, I need to change that setting back though, because what it forces me to do though, is I have to go through those days and manually say no to every single meeting. And then this actually started because I think I took a random day off to attach to a long weekend.
[00:32:08.300] And it was like automatically decline all calendar invites, new and old. And it scared me. So I said, no, but I think I do have it set to automatically decline new ones, but not old ones. So I have to manually decline the old ones. It feels bad. We're different people. I'm like, this feels great.
[00:32:32.850] Like I'm not attending any of these meetings. Oh my God. I think it's because I, a lot of my meetings are, it's the one team meeting of the week. I just don't have that many meetings. So every meeting feels like a, I should go. I'm obligated to go. Yeah. So it feels even worse to be like, no, I'm just going to skip this because I literally have nothing else on my calendar.
[00:33:01.510] Okay. I have two more rapid fire questions for you. When you book time off on your team calendar, do you put crystal OOO or do you put crystal PTO? Oh, crystal OOO. Oh, okay. I think it's like implied that we're taking PTO. Yeah. Yeah. I actually matched the vibes of my team. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm like, if this team does PTO, I'll do PTO. If this other team does OOO, I'll do OOO.
[00:33:28.370] You know what? That's a good point. I think everyone on my team just puts OOO. So if they all put PTO, I probably would be like, blend in. No need to stand out when you're taking PTO. Facts, honestly. Last question for you. How do you feel about people who say I'm going to be out of pocket? Oh my God. Okay. So this is a huge thing because I looked into it because I was like, this is like not
[00:33:58.210] what out of pocket means. Right. But I looked into it and I think what some people think it means is like their phone is out of their pocket. They're going to be on vacation. Like they're not bringing their work stuff. So they're going to be unreachable. And I was like, okay, I guess that does make sense. But like, why is it happening? Here's the craziest part. When I looked
[00:34:21.750] into it, it was like older people, millennials to boomers who are using this a lot. Because I think when Gen Z were using it, they were like just accidentally, legitimately accidentally using it. And I was like, okay, but then why is this coming back? Do you know what I mean? Like we've been using out of office for so long. Like why are we bringing back this out of pocket when it can be so confused with the other meaning?
[00:34:50.890] Yeah, dude. I feel like I have to clarify for the listeners because as soon as I brought up the phrase out of pocket or like, you know, people misusing out of pocket, Crystal started looking so angry. Like your entire demeanor changed. And I'm actually crying laughing. I didn't even realize.
[00:35:18.300] But it is very interesting. I remember once you texted me like, oh my god, I think these people are using out of pocket wrong to mean out of office. And I was like, what? Like, that's crazy. And after you texted me that I've been seeing it everywhere. And every time I see it, it just cracks me up. Yeah, because out of pocket for us, it means like, like unhinged comment or something. Yeah, right. Like very, like you said something really rude. When people are like, I'm going to
[00:35:46.720] be out of pocket. You're like bracing yourself like, oh, okay, what is like the mean thing you're about to say? Yeah, yeah. Like drop the mic. But they're actually just going to Hawaii. Yeah. Also, OOO does not even mean out of pocket. OOO is out of office. Out of pocket is OOP.
[00:36:12.140] So true. There's just so many things wrong. Just all the signs point to you're misusing this phrase. You're so like worked up. Yeah, it's because I just haven't found a satisfying answer. You know, I need to do more digging on this because this is like the best explanation that I could find. It's like, oh, okay, like your phone's out of your pocket. You know, I'm going to be unreachable. But I'm like,
[00:36:37.600] okay, really? Like, I feel like that's kind of awkward phrasing too. Like I'm going to be out of pocket versus like, I'm just not going to bring my work stuff. Yeah. And the only work thing that fits into your pocket is like your phone. Yeah. Your laptop doesn't fit in your pocket. Exactly. So you are not your laptop. Exactly. That's the thing, right? So I'm kind of like,
[00:37:00.980] this phrasing just doesn't feel right. I dare you to call out the next person you see on Slack saying I'm going to be out of pocket. Oh my God. I actually have not seen someone use that in like maybe a year. So that's good. The out of pocket pandemic is over. Yeah. Hopefully. Yeah. Like ever since I texted you that one time, I haven't really seen it since. Oh, okay. Maybe it
[00:37:30.840] was just an auto correct or something. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I've been seeing it on my end. So you just passed the baton to me. Okay. But what if it's also like, it was an accident, but now it's just like people started using it ironically because they thought it was funny and now they can't stop using it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a meme. Yeah. Pretty much. I'll report back if I ever find,
[00:37:57.080] if I ever uncover more truths about this out of pocket situation. It's an unsolved mystery. Yeah. I have a question for you. Yeah. So for PTO, do you leave all of your work stuff at home? So it depends. If I'm taking a vacation like overseas, I will not bring my laptop for the most part, but my phone has all of like my work stuff logged into it. So if I need to urgently
[00:38:26.720] respond to an email or like a Slack message or something, I'll have it on hand. I'll usually turn off notifications to be honest, but you can select it so that it's like, oh, turn off notifications unless it's from my manager or something like that. So I'll usually toggle some sort of setting like that. But if I am going on vacation and it's local or like domestic, I will bring my laptop because then it's just like easy to bring it along with me. Yeah. That's fair. I think I would
[00:38:55.180] agree with that. I'm probably of similar pattern. I have another final question. How long does it take you to catch up on your inbox when you come back from PTO? Oh God, wait, I'm getting like anxiety just thinking about it, to be honest. Okay. Nevermind. You don't have to answer. Wait, I actually feel like the corporate setting or like your team setting is very important for this.
[00:39:19.900] In my past lives, I feel like it would literally take me like a week and I would come back to like over a thousand emails just because of like the sheer nature of what my work was focused around. There's always like all these comms going on. I'm working with like 40 different teams, like external people are emailing me. So it will legitimately take me like a week. But I think in like a more chill or also
[00:39:44.620] like a more specialized environment, like if you're on a team that handles a couple of things and not all these different things for like everyone, then I think it would probably take me like a day or two. I think for me, it's usually around a day. Also, I'm like not super high up. So I don't have a lot of people reaching out to me directly for really important stuff. They can always just reach out to my
[00:40:10.000] manager. I think when I feel the worst though, is when I'm in a long thread and I'm on PTO and every time they send an email, they get my auto response. I'm like, I'm so sorry guys. But yeah, I feel like those long threads are the biggest thing, right? Because you have to like read through everything that you missed. Yeah, yeah. Or I have trauma from like coming back on vacation to all these emails
[00:40:39.900] and you open each email and it says like, oh, Jisoo's on PTO till Monday, but she's back on Tuesday. I'll have her look at this ASAP when she's back. And there's like 40 of those. And I'm like, holy fuck, how am I supposed to catch up on all of this? Oh my god. Yeah, that's intense. Yeah. Or the other one is like, if you're on a smaller team or maybe there's like less structure in the company that
[00:41:05.820] you're working at, your team might not have like a distribution email, you know? So like if people are personally emailing you for stuff, but no other people are CC'd. So it's just like sitting there for the two weeks that you're out. I feel like that feels really bad. But as long as you know, your other people are getting CC'd, usually someone will take care of it. Yeah. But sometimes people might not know who else to reach out to. So it's just they're left unanswered for multiple weeks. Yeah, that's so true. That's probably the worst part about coming back from PTO.
[00:41:36.340] Catching up on the inbox. Yeah. Wait, I'm like about to break out into a cold sweat. Oh no. Okay, we'll stop talking about it. But it's always fun to come back and chat with your team members about all the fun things you did. True. Wait, my favorite thing is when people come back from vacation and then they like show you photos. I'm like, this is so cute. It's like IRL Instagram. Yeah. So what I've started to well, one time when I went on vacation, my team was like, take pictures,
[00:42:05.880] take pictures. And you know me, I usually don't really take that many pictures, especially if I'm traveling like alone or maybe with like small groups. So that time I was traveling alone and I was like, they said it so much, like take pictures, take pictures. I was like, I owe it to them. They don't really know me that well. I should really show them more about my like, you know, random adventures. And there's no harm in sharing pictures about my personal travels. So at that time, I made a very
[00:42:35.480] intentional effort to take photos. After the trip, I even made a little presentation. Well, it was just like photos slapped on with some captions. Yeah. But I was like, here you go. You can all look at my pictures since you all requested it. So now I'm like, it's kind of nice to share that. It's a good bonding topic too. So I try to take at least a couple photos that are acceptable to show to my team
[00:43:04.100] nowadays. That is very cute. I feel so shy like sharing photos, but I do. I will try to take like one or two key stories. So when people are like, how's your vacation? I could be like, oh my God, you'll never believe what happened. Blah, blah, blah. And it's just like a talking point. Auditory evidence that I actually vacationed. Yeah. They're like, did this person actually vacation? They always
[00:43:28.340] take PTO, but they never share. That's like me. Same. I'm like, guys, I'm actually traveling. Please believe me. Well, aside from the brief moment of nausea where I was like, oh my God, how am I going to catch up on my hypothetical inbox? This has been very interesting to talk about our personal PTO rules. And it also makes me very excited for all the upcoming PTO that you and I both have
[00:43:56.900] for the rest of the year. If there's any PTO tips that Crystal and I didn't cover, please feel free to reach out to us.
