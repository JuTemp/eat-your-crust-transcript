[00:00:00.000] Hi and welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Harpreet.
[00:00:16.590] Welcome Harpreet to the podcast. Before we get to our topic at hand, we have a fun slang word to
[00:00:22.990] talk about. The word is pookie and it's also sometimes used as pookie bear. I think this
[00:00:30.270] word is really funny because it sounds like what it is, a pet name for someone you care about or love.
[00:00:37.550] And it's pretty funny because the way it's used as slang is kind of ironically or poking fun at
[00:00:45.550] the usage of these kinds of sometimes silly pet names. I've actually first seen it from the NBA
[00:00:53.550] or a lot of fans like to call their favorite players pookie especially in moments where they're
[00:00:58.750] praising them or admiring them. So I have like a personal theory on why this has
[00:01:05.550] researched lately because the word pookie in that term specifically is not new, but there's some
[00:01:11.310] sort of couple on TikTok that blew up and they live this like very lavish lifestyle. They're very
[00:01:17.710] very affectionate to each other and it's to the point where their skits and TikToks almost
[00:01:23.230] feel scripted. So that couple, I think the guy's name is like jet or something and the girl's
[00:01:28.270] name is pookie. The couple, they narrate their video. So the guy's like, oh today pookie and I went to
[00:01:33.630] go do this like blah blah blah. So then I feel like it became a meme of this is like a very publicly
[00:01:39.950] affectionate couple who love posting their affectionate pet names for each other. So let's kind
[00:01:45.710] of take the pookie meme and roll with it essentially. Wow, I had no idea that that couple existed.
[00:01:52.030] I didn't know that people are using it in the media just for terms of
[00:01:55.390] endearment for random people I guess, but I might start using that just for my friends.
[00:02:00.830] So I mentioned that I see this a lot in sports so one funny example I can think of is in my fantasy
[00:02:07.310] league with a couple of my high school friends. One of the people, one of the teams they have
[00:02:12.990] LeBron and they named their fantasy team my glorious pookie player.
[00:02:19.150] He's got a game.
[00:02:20.990] Dude, LeBron is like the perfect I guess victim of this pookie meme because there was this one dinner
[00:02:27.950] where James and I were talking with Eddie our friend. I had mentioned something about like oh
[00:02:33.070] LeBron is so funny I'm in my LeBron era. I love his whatever blah blah. Afterwards Eddie
[00:02:38.670] texted me a compilation video of LeBron highlights and then he was like pookie
[00:02:43.950] and I just laughed so hard when I saw it. It's like you're fucking right this is pookie.
[00:02:50.590] I think it's also funny because it's mostly men using this to call other men pookie which for
[00:02:57.710] some reason just kind of adds to the hilarity and kind of the charm of it all.
[00:03:02.590] This is a great term of endearment. I'm gonna call Jace you that as soon as he gets back.
[00:03:06.430] Dude, I could totally see you calling Jason that and I feel like the gender stuff
[00:03:10.990] actually does kind of make sense because maybe a bunch of episodes ago we talked about how
[00:03:16.030] people call male celebrities. He's in his baby girl era or he's so baby girl coded but I felt
[00:03:21.950] like that was always a woman saying that about a man but I feel like pookie is very much so like a
[00:03:27.710] man calling a man that and that's where the humor comes from so men any men listening out there
[00:03:34.590] go call your friends pookie.
[00:03:36.110] You know I haven't heard of the baby girl era either honestly.
[00:03:40.030] When I talk about women I guess I have been saying like boss lady and whatnot but I also
[00:03:45.390] know that I tend to be like a few months behind trends so it doesn't surprise me.
[00:03:51.710] This is also interesting to me because I feel like I've been seeing some sort of wave of men
[00:03:58.190] being more expressive and accepting of being pampered so you know baby girl era kind of plays
[00:04:03.550] into this where men are like you know what actually it is really nice to be pampered.
[00:04:08.670] Like I do want to be passenger princess once in a while that kind of stuff and I think pookie kind
[00:04:14.270] of plays a role in this wave too where it's an opportunity for men to really admire each other
[00:04:21.950] or kind of share that love for each other in a funny way that's not too serious and I think
[00:04:28.430] everyone just enjoys it and can laugh about it. They're like I love my bro so much but how do I
[00:04:34.910] make it funny? True. Oh man I wonder if that's why I've had the urge to get my eyebrows threaded
[00:04:42.430] recently and I don't know why. You might be in your baby girl era. Yeah I must be in my baby girl
[00:04:49.630] Hey man everyone has a right to be in their baby girl era. All in all though I think pookie
[00:04:54.830] is such a funny slang word that is super popular right now and I feel like it's a very good vibes
[00:05:01.070] kind of everyone's gonna laugh about it and I personally find it really entertaining when I'm
[00:05:07.390] scrolling through you know TikTok or comments or whatever. Yeah definitely. Pookiebear aside today we
[00:05:14.350] do have a pretty interesting topic. We wanted to talk a little bit about networking and really
[00:05:20.510] building rapport and building out connections with people sometimes in a professional way or
[00:05:25.550] sometimes just in a casual and social manner but I feel like networking is one of those
[00:05:30.830] buzzwords that low-key I used to hear about a lot more back in college because I feel like
[00:05:36.670] post college when you're actually working people aren't constantly talking about like oh we need
[00:05:41.150] a network or maybe that's just the industry I'm in. That's true I don't really network in my
[00:05:46.750] job either to be honest but yeah maybe that's industry related or you know the nature of my job
[00:05:55.390] but I do remember networking was kind of big because of job fairs and stuff from college
[00:06:01.390] but to be honest I didn't really attend those either. In all honesty I feel like it was very
[00:06:08.910] weird I remember I attended one at the end of you know end of our senior year and I was like
[00:06:13.630] I just have like a folder of my resume that basically had nothing on it and I'm just like
[00:06:18.350] going around to people and handing it out and trying to sell them on this weird me like that
[00:06:25.550] doesn't even know what job they have that I'm applying to yeah I definitely feel like I would
[00:06:30.510] not want to go to another job fair after that experience. Yeah I think I went to maybe one
[00:06:36.590] job fair at most in college and I'm not sure if it was that helpful for me honestly I mean
[00:06:42.510] maybe I just was bad at networking but I think the end result with most of these companies that I
[00:06:49.310] chatted with was just oh you can go back and go to our webpage and find a job and apply there
[00:06:55.150] so ultimately it didn't really feel super helpful but I do think some of my friends who are more
[00:07:01.630] in STEM or like CS had a better experience because I know sometimes they did literally
[00:07:08.510] interviews on site at those job fairs but in my experience in my limited job fair experience
[00:07:15.310] it wasn't super helpful personally. Yeah and I feel like the really awkward thing about job fairs is
[00:07:23.150] for me as someone who has social anxiety meeting someone one-on-one and like trying to have a
[00:07:29.070] meaningful conversation with them is already kind of hard enough but you're doing that with
[00:07:33.790] line of 50 people behind you who are waiting to have the same exact conversation with like slightly
[00:07:39.470] different nuances and details with the interviewer so then I feel like it's just super awkward where
[00:07:44.190] you're like I feel like these people can hear me so you're extra self-conscious and you also hear
[00:07:49.070] the interviewer or the representative of the company giving the same 10 second spiel you've
[00:07:53.630] heard 40 times in line already. I just remember being really anxious and after going to one I
[00:07:58.990] was like okay yeah I don't think I could ever go to one ever again. I don't know about you
[00:08:02.910] all but I feel like these networking events feel kind of not genuine sometimes it feels like
[00:08:11.230] you know you're trying to say the right thing or you know something that'll make you stand out to
[00:08:17.150] people and it just feels kind of like you have a front up and it's not quite you out there.
[00:08:23.470] True and I feel like just something about the term networking makes me think there has to be
[00:08:29.070] an exchange sort of of like some sort of service or like favor. I feel like if it wasn't associated
[00:08:35.550] with the term networking and you met someone who would just be like oh it was like cool meeting
[00:08:38.590] this person but when the word networking gets involved it feels a little bit transactional maybe
[00:08:43.710] and a little bit too professional and cold so I remember feeling pretty intimidated by the word
[00:08:48.110] itself. Yeah it definitely feels like there's like added pressure there to somehow form a bond
[00:08:53.870] like you mentioned they're giving their elevator pitch and you somehow have to also throw your
[00:08:57.950] elevator pitch out there and like Crystal said to going back to like the college reference from
[00:09:02.590] a few moments ago trying to stand out compared to the 80 other kids that probably have the same exact
[00:09:07.870] resume as you. Yeah I totally agree with what you said Jisoo that's a really good way of putting
[00:09:13.710] it. It just feels very transactional like this is stuff that I do and how does that relate to
[00:09:19.150] you and I feel like you can definitely tell when people are more interested in you because
[00:09:24.590] of maybe your connections or your position at work I don't know they're like foaming at the
[00:09:31.310] mouth to like get your time. It's slimy. I do think that certain industries probably rely a little bit
[00:09:38.430] more heavily on networking like I can totally see how someone who's maybe in sales or finance
[00:09:45.390] or something like that like something that requires a lot more social interaction maybe
[00:09:48.590] networking is a lot more helpful. I do remember actually going back to those dreaded job fairs
[00:09:54.590] seeing people with really good elevator pitches and honestly just like a pretty personable warmth
[00:10:00.670] to them when they were talking to the interviewer and being very impressed. Like I can't believe
[00:10:04.910] both of us are 21-22 but I'm here like stuttering through my 10 second intro
[00:10:10.910] and they're here dapping up the interviewer basically. That's a good point. I agree there's
[00:10:16.670] definitely positions out there like you said that benefit a lot from networking. Luckily for
[00:10:22.590] me I'm not in one of those positions. How about you all do you think networking plays a role in your
[00:10:30.190] job or industry? Sadly I'm in biotech and so biotech on its own and then specifically like
[00:10:38.110] a lot of the biotech companies are in South San Francisco. If you work here you're probably
[00:10:42.670] going to work at another company like literally down the street or on the same exit
[00:10:46.590] and people are always just hopping around so it's sort of hard to not try to at least have like that
[00:10:53.710] baseline networking done. So all the fun small talk and leaving a good rapport with people.
[00:10:58.750] Yeah I mean specifically for biotech it feels like you need to do it a little bit because
[00:11:02.510] everyone somehow ends up knowing everybody or there's somebody from your company that's
[00:11:06.990] going to be at the next one you're going to apply to and it just always it always helps out.
[00:11:10.990] Yeah I think I'm probably in a similar boat to Heartpreet. I think my job specifically isn't
[00:11:16.430] super networking focused but the industry that I'm in is very small especially in the Bay Area
[00:11:22.830] so then everyone knows each other through like one or two bridges max and it's very very common for
[00:11:29.230] new people joining our company to already know like a handful of people who are at our company.
[00:11:34.590] I feel like it's not an explicit need like it is in some industries but it's definitely
[00:11:39.150] something where it's almost more of like the oh don't burn any bridges kind of networking rather
[00:11:44.190] than oh this person will be useful later on in my career kind of networking. True can't be burning
[00:11:49.710] too many bridges out there. For now until you guys are boss ladies then it's over.
[00:11:56.350] So I do want to kind of touch back on I guess what I would consider success stories for
[00:12:02.030] networking. I feel like networking to some extent is a skill that you kind of learn and build
[00:12:08.350] upon. I mean my personal approach to networking I feel like I'm still fine-tuning but I have seen
[00:12:13.710] people do it really well so do you guys have any examples of witnessing someone maybe build a
[00:12:18.030] connection with someone and being very impressed by how naturally or easily they were able to do it?
[00:12:23.870] I will say just to bring up Jsu again touching back on this exactly what I thought of Jsu when
[00:12:29.870] you mentioned you're seeing somebody like tap up the interviewer. When I hear Jsu interact with
[00:12:35.470] his colleagues it's like super impressive. It sounds like a super casual conversation like it just
[00:12:40.670] sounds like he's talking to one of us. I guess it depends on what you define as like a successful
[00:12:45.790] networking like dogma but I think everyone has their own way. I personally think I always have
[00:12:52.510] to start with small talk and then find a small nugget that they'll give me and then just try
[00:12:58.110] to really hammer it till I can divulge the conversation a little more and open it up
[00:13:03.150] and then try to connect on like a personal level if there's anything to even connect on.
[00:13:07.390] There are I feel like a lot of times where you just don't vibe with the person it just doesn't work out.
[00:13:14.670] I think definitely when I said the Dapping Up story I was also kind of envisioning Jsu so that
[00:13:19.870] is hilarious but actually I thought Heartbreak you would be such a good guest for this episode
[00:13:24.750] too because I consider you someone who is very good at networking definitely someone who's really
[00:13:29.950] personable and kind of easy to get to know. I feel like that's sometimes the hard part right
[00:13:35.150] it's like especially in a professional setting for example how do you mix being professional while
[00:13:40.190] also being yourself and I think getting a good balance between those two is really where like
[00:13:45.950] the difficulty and the nuance lies. This actually makes me reflect on what networking means
[00:13:52.750] beyond just these events that we've kind of been talking about like job fairs or
[00:13:57.790] you know networking specific events. I'm starting to realize that the connections we have in our office
[00:14:05.230] are also a part of networking you know building that relationship with your co-workers or your
[00:14:11.630] stakeholders and people that you work with closely this I guess would be your more immediate
[00:14:17.630] network and so building and maintaining those connections is just as important maybe even
[00:14:23.550] more important in a lot of ways in this world of networking because you know making sure that these
[00:14:28.990] relationships are healthy positive and functional ensures that working every day is a lot easier
[00:14:37.710] than if these connections were not as developed. Yeah I feel like there's definitely a lot of merit
[00:14:43.870] to doing that especially because these are the people you see the most often and oftentimes
[00:14:49.470] people you have like a deeper connection with rather than a fleeting like moment of networking
[00:14:56.510] can be bigger helps or it can become longer and like closer connections later on in life too.
[00:15:01.550] Yeah and honestly thinking about it now and reflecting I think I'm similar to you Jisoo
[00:15:06.910] how you mentioned earlier that you kind of have a fear of the word networking I totally
[00:15:11.710] agree because I think I always viewed it as something really uptight proper and like official
[00:15:19.470] but now that you know we're talking it through and I made the realization earlier that you know
[00:15:24.910] connecting with your co-workers is in a sense networking too it makes me feel a lot more
[00:15:30.110] comfortable with this word and I kind of like this shifting slash reframing of the word networking
[00:15:38.110] it makes it feel much more approachable and reasonable I guess. I have two things to
[00:15:45.630] say about that I guess first one relating it back to attaching pressure to the term networking
[00:15:51.870] when you guys first asked me about the topic I was definitely a little nervous because like I
[00:15:55.390] don't know if like I think I'm decent at it and I want to say thank you for saying that you
[00:16:00.750] think I'm good at it because I'm not good at taking confidence so I'm going to take it as
[00:16:06.030] I'm in my baby girl era when you guys also mentioned like networking slash like building
[00:16:11.630] rapport keeping connections with people that part definitely eased my mind and I was like oh yeah it
[00:16:16.190] doesn't necessarily have to be in the professional setting but on the flip side I feel like when I
[00:16:21.790] do sort of do that similar approach reaching back out to old managers or people in the industry
[00:16:27.310] that you've kept up with I feel like when I have done that certain mentors I've had I feel like
[00:16:32.830] when I email them they're just like what's up what do you need so I feel like they sort of know
[00:16:38.350] it's like I'm at like a point in my life where I'm about to look for a new job or a lost
[00:16:43.630] maybe I need to work on that I mean that's good though your mentors are so ready and happy
[00:16:50.750] to help you out right away they're like hey what do you what do you need I'm here that's great this
[00:16:55.870] is also just how my mom picks up the phone on the daily when I call her she's like what's wrong
[00:17:00.830] like mom I'm like your literal daughter I just want to chat my mom will also be that
[00:17:06.590] and it leaves me so much anxiety I'm like is there something wrong yeah oh my god wait actually
[00:17:15.630] I think I pick up the phone from my mom I pick up like oh what's wrong is there anything you need
[00:17:24.750] everyone's just always concerned do you guys text your parents more or call them more
[00:17:29.630] I personally text my mom more but my mom just responds with a k just literally k
[00:17:35.390] my mom actually also like sending voice memos to me which honestly they're not bad but I feel like
[00:17:43.070] I'm listening to it and I'm like why am I listening to a voicemail right now you're like this is
[00:17:47.150] worse than a text and worse than a call yeah I think me or my mom texts a lot but phone calls I
[00:17:55.950] feel like are more upkeep maybe like once every two weeks or so I'm just generally terrible at
[00:18:02.670] texting as you guys probably know now working on it always working on it but yeah I think my mom
[00:18:09.150] probably texts me more than I text her but I'll usually just if she texts me I'll just call her
[00:18:12.990] like what do you want oh my god it's kind of the opposite for you to like usually parents
[00:18:20.670] respond to a text by calling but you respond to your mom's text by calling yeah I'm a self-proclaimed
[00:18:28.030] well on the topic of texting versus calling how do you reach out to old co-workers or old
[00:18:34.830] connections do you call them text them email them usually email and then I always say like
[00:18:42.030] I'd love to set up a call or being person coffee whatever I can't say I've really reached out
[00:18:47.630] to like old co-workers or anything like that but the times that I have interacted with old
[00:18:52.510] co-workers it's always been text I feel like email might feel a little bit too working professional
[00:18:58.190] girly vibes that's true I think I can agree email definitely feels like super proper I think the
[00:19:05.790] way that I've hit up old co-workers sometimes we bump into each other in the hall at work so we
[00:19:11.150] kind of have like drive by highs you know to each other but from there that kind of sparks
[00:19:16.750] the conversation like oh I'll find some time on your calendar and we just send a calendar
[00:19:21.470] invite no email maybe like a work DM so that's usually what I do for old co-workers who are
[00:19:28.590] still at the company maybe for people who aren't at the same company anymore I would maybe maybe
[00:19:36.270] send an email like a lighthearted email or if I have their number I could try texting so what
[00:19:41.950] I find really interesting that I've experienced at this company is like you know how people
[00:19:47.390] do goodbye emails to the company when they leave I always found it interesting that a lot of my
[00:19:53.790] ex-corkers will be like oh like hoping and keep in touch here's my email either linkedin or phone
[00:19:59.390] number and then here's my instagram oh i'm like dude instagram is wild oh my god like yeah wow at
[00:20:05.630] first I was with you like you know linkedin phone number that's all normal but then you said
[00:20:10.350] instagram I was like wait what dude so I do have a lot of ex-corkers like we keep up over IGDMs
[00:20:17.790] oh interesting what is the general age of your co-workers if you don't mind me asking
[00:20:23.630] I mean that's a fair question like a lot of my co-workers tend to be plus or minus 10 to 15 years
[00:20:28.350] or so and then women so then you know our generation we love our instagram whatever so
[00:20:34.350] it does feel a little bit less like invasion of privacy and more like oh here's my casual
[00:20:38.670] instagram but it's just so funny thinking about IGDMs also being networking oh my god imagine
[00:20:44.590] genz is like hey here's my snapchat no god what do your co-workers post on instagram I think a lot of
[00:20:54.910] it is just like oh here's my family here's my hobby I like to cook like kind of standard stuff
[00:21:01.070] but sometimes people post like kind of political stuff on their instagram story too and I always
[00:21:07.070] find that interesting it's never anything outlandish or nothing that makes me feel weird
[00:21:11.790] considering the demographics of where we live I feel like people lean a certain way
[00:21:15.710] there's like a certain standard that you are used to but yeah I just could never imagine sending
[00:21:21.630] like a to all like to literally every single person in the company here's my instagram you know
[00:21:26.430] what I mean I mean imagine the CEO sees this yeah but maybe that is a way to keep that feeling
[00:21:34.190] a little bit less formal and more casual because like we talked about email sometimes
[00:21:40.030] does feel very professional but through instagram I feel like once you see someone's family or something
[00:21:45.870] you just feel like you know them so much more or like so much deeper even if you haven't really
[00:21:50.350] talked about it directly or have never met their family like you still kind of get a better
[00:21:54.510] sense of what this person's life is like and I feel like it's definitely a sign of like true
[00:22:02.430] connection there was this one time at work where there was an event and I was you know
[00:22:07.630] really starting to bond with one of my co-workers we kept DMing each other through work chat and then
[00:22:13.630] at one point she was just like oh here like this is actually my phone number you know I don't always
[00:22:18.670] respond right away to my work DMs just message me here I'll respond a lot faster and I was like
[00:22:24.590] oh my god like I'm so honored to have your phone number you know I it was a very exciting moment
[00:22:31.070] and I really felt much more connected do you draw a fine line though with the people you'd want to
[00:22:37.230] text because I definitely feel like there are certain co-workers where even if they give me
[00:22:44.110] their number there's no shot I want to like break that personal barrier of like hey it's okay to text
[00:22:49.390] me at any time of the day yeah that's definitely true luckily though I have a work phone number
[00:22:57.470] that most people at work have access to and you know that is specifically for work and I guess it's a
[00:23:03.870] lot more rare for me to actually share my personal number with co-workers okay that's fair there was
[00:23:11.310] a particular instance when I did get a call from my VP because like something was happening at the
[00:23:17.550] company and I was like fully in the shower and I saw it to like call from maybe you know your VP
[00:23:24.030] and I was just like I was like oh no am I getting fired I was like what is happening
[00:23:29.950] but yeah it was nothing it was nothing terrible that's good we also don't have that they recently
[00:23:35.390] have been offering us like a work phone if we want it for security purposes but this job in
[00:23:41.470] my last job it's just been like our actual phones that you see right away under your contact
[00:23:46.830] information there well one potential worker on this is you can maybe get like a virtual
[00:23:53.390] number through google voice and then treat that as your work phone number and like pass it out to people
[00:24:01.950] okay I might I might need to do that yeah I think that's actually how our work phone number works
[00:24:06.990] so even if you don't have like a physical work phone you can just use the like google voice
[00:24:11.230] virtual number okay I think I might need to do that because the only co-workers I've given
[00:24:16.110] my number to that X is the ones that I will you know hang out with outside of work pretty
[00:24:21.550] right it is kind of interesting talking about giving out personal phone numbers and what not
[00:24:26.510] though because I totally agree that is very much like breaking a certain boundary or like barrier
[00:24:32.430] almost once you start to be comfortable texting this person instead of work slack and etc but
[00:24:38.990] the question is like how do you break that boundary you know like I think it's easy enough
[00:24:42.990] when someone else broaches that for you but if you have someone that you want to become
[00:24:48.670] better friends with and not just oh slack during work hours friends with then how would you personally
[00:24:53.790] go about that honestly I think I just wait for the other person to give me their number
[00:25:00.190] yeah same honestly I think it's either happened from the other person saying it or I got thrown
[00:25:05.950] into like a group text and they already had those people's numbers I think there was one other time
[00:25:10.750] where one of those co-workers that I was it was like okay to be friends with they were going
[00:25:15.470] to New York or visiting somewhere and I was like oh I have like a list of wrecks if you want it so
[00:25:19.630] they're just like oh just feel free to text it to me it's a nice easy way to do that you're like
[00:25:25.310] are we friends now yeah we're all just shy we are although I will say I have you know initiated
[00:25:33.870] like the number exchange a couple times wow I mean part of it is the paranoia because I feel
[00:25:39.310] like when you communicate on work platforms like I don't always want to share everything about my
[00:25:44.750] life on a work platform so then maybe if we're going to go out later or something like that I'm
[00:25:49.470] like oh yeah like what's your number and then we'll just casually exchange it I think you just have
[00:25:53.630] to have a couple of good conversations and that it's okay to broach that boundary a couple of non-small
[00:26:00.110] talk exchanges and then you're qualified to exchange phone numbers I wonder too though maybe
[00:26:06.190] it's a little harder or less common for us personally to initiate this exchanging of
[00:26:13.710] phone numbers because nowadays we're so connected like you know work chat slack whatever we get the
[00:26:20.430] notifications on our phone and it's pretty close to having someone's number maybe that's like another
[00:26:27.310] factor that slows us down from sharing our personal number with our co-workers yeah that's a
[00:26:33.630] good point maybe also because we are younger and maybe like earlier in our careers because I remember
[00:26:39.950] seeing my dad's address book you know back then it used to be like a journal almost and you would
[00:26:44.350] like hand write the address book and I remember like all of them were past colleagues or associates
[00:26:50.590] because once you move companies or the longer you work more and more people jump to different
[00:26:55.230] companies so my dad would just keep all of their phone numbers and like emails for us we're
[00:27:00.510] probably at the first couple companies you know maybe we're only like five years deep into our
[00:27:06.270] career so less of a need for that yet handwriting something is crazy yeah I think the other day my
[00:27:14.110] co-worker was like do we even use paper anymore and I was like oh shoot I think I do sometimes
[00:27:20.750] I still hand write my notes a bit I prefer that and I definitely like retain things a lot better if
[00:27:26.350] I do that but I don't feel like I have the time to anymore but it was it was really funny
[00:27:30.990] I had been taking some notes on some stuff that I saw in lab like put on my desk and one
[00:27:34.910] of those co-workers that I'm close to walk by she was just like is that your handwriting
[00:27:40.590] I was like you're gonna help me like that like I thought I was gonna be a doctor so I was practicing
[00:27:46.670] to have chicken scratch no it's so true though because I feel like in high school I know how
[00:27:53.310] all of my close friends handwriting looks like but the people that I met post high school like
[00:27:58.350] even college friends like I have no idea what their handwriting looks like because we didn't
[00:28:01.390] really hand write shit oh my god that's so true yeah like before we could just recognize our like
[00:28:08.030] closest friends handwriting so true well besides our already formed connections like our old co-workers
[00:28:15.630] or current co-workers have you ever successfully followed up with someone after meeting them for
[00:28:23.230] the first time at like a networking event or wherever I did meet someone it wasn't necessarily
[00:28:29.390] a networking event but it was back in college I went to like a resume workshop and the people who
[00:28:36.430] were reviewing your resume for you were working professionals so then this person who worked
[00:28:42.430] at some sort of bank or something like that reviewed my resume gave me a couple pointers
[00:28:46.590] and was like oh actually like I'm intrigued by some of the stuff that you worked on in your
[00:28:51.150] classes here's my business card feel free to like shoot me a note if you want some sort of
[00:28:56.030] like summer job and yeah so I got the business card I was like whoa what the fuck and then I like
[00:29:02.910] thought about it for a little bit and then I was like okay I'm gonna email this person so I emailed him
[00:29:07.630] and I was like hey like it was so nice meeting you thanks for the pointers blah blah would love
[00:29:12.350] to know what the opportunities are you know something generic email and then I sent it
[00:29:16.830] and then we had a couple of exchanges like back and forth I think like the logistics of where
[00:29:21.630] the location of the job and stuff didn't end up working out but I was still like
[00:29:26.270] I can't believe these things happen where someone is just like oh this is pretty cool like do you
[00:29:30.030] want a job because I felt like it was such a like I mean I guess not that big of a deal but
[00:29:34.670] for me it felt like a very big deal and like a movie moment almost no dude that's definitely a
[00:29:39.470] big deal that's so cool that was you making it yeah that's the American dream
[00:29:46.590] yeah yeah do you see just let her her resume dude talking for her we're out there in the corner
[00:29:55.390] being shy and she's just she's just getting all the jobs seriously I mean I feel like if I were
[00:30:01.870] in that position I would think about it and I would ponder and like you know kind of go back
[00:30:08.430] and forth and I'd be like oh fuck it like I'm too shy I know exactly what you're talking about
[00:30:15.550] though because I remember feeling that way too and it's almost backwards because it's like oh this
[00:30:20.110] person was the one who thought my resume was kind of interesting so he was like let me know if you
[00:30:25.550] want me to help you with something right but then I'm the one who felt the pressure of like oh I
[00:30:31.550] now I feel like I can't let this person down or like you know like met this guy for like 20 minutes
[00:30:36.190] one day and I just felt all this like weird pressure for myself so I think that's the thing
[00:30:41.070] about networking there's just so much pressure for no reason for sure I guess this kind of just goes
[00:30:47.230] to show that it's kind of cliche to say but like you know there's no loss in trying like the worst
[00:30:53.470] that can happen is this guy says uh actually no sorry we ended up not having positions
[00:30:59.390] but that is like very minimal loss compared to the potential gain that you could have had
[00:31:06.190] you know he did have opportunities and you got to talk more about it and
[00:31:10.430] you almost got a job out of it too so I think I've been kind of noticing that in just like
[00:31:16.830] day-to-day life too not just networking things or work related stuff so I think that's definitely
[00:31:23.390] a good philosophy to keep in mind yeah I fully super resonate with that piece of advice because I
[00:31:30.910] maybe not in my personal life but in my professional life I hammer that so hard because
[00:31:36.590] most of the time or maybe I've just realized I don't have much to lose if you're just sending
[00:31:40.830] an email like that or asking a question and so I'm like instilled in my brain that like literally
[00:31:46.110] the worst thing that's gonna happen is they're gonna say no and tough shit you know like I can
[00:31:51.150] move on with my life if that's the answer so it's it's not it's not that big of a deal
[00:31:55.390] yeah definitely easier in a professional setting for me for some reason to sort of have that
[00:31:59.950] mindset rather than a personal setting that's like goals honestly I don't know what it is for me
[00:32:06.430] but there's been times where people are like oh I applied to this job at your company like can we
[00:32:11.710] chat or can you give me a referral you know even people in college reaching out and be like oh can
[00:32:16.590] you review my resume blah blah and every time that comes in I'm like oh that's like cool that
[00:32:20.350] they would ask me like of course I'm more than happy to do it I'll like give them long paragraphs
[00:32:24.830] of advice and like spend a lot of time on it whatever but when it comes time for me to maybe ask
[00:32:30.830] for the reverse I'm like oh I don't want to like bother this person I don't want to be a burden
[00:32:36.350] and despite me having received those exact same requests and not feeling like they were a
[00:32:41.390] burden at all I think my brain just reverse engineers it and I'm like I'm a burden on this
[00:32:46.590] person so I think what both of you said is super important to keep in mind it's like
[00:32:51.390] fuck it like why not kind of a mentality for sure and honestly I I feel like this is super
[00:32:57.790] applicable to work too and I'm still working on this for sure but basically you know asking for help
[00:33:04.910] or asking clarifying questions yeah and I feel like it's totally possible that someone else is
[00:33:10.750] wondering the same thing and you know you ask this clarifying question and now you understand
[00:33:15.790] it better you'll be able to do your project better and you know other people who are also
[00:33:20.510] curious or didn't quite grasp what was happening get a refresher too so I feel like it's definitely
[00:33:27.710] something that's really beneficial in the long run and overall that's what I'm still working on too
[00:33:34.910] it's like you know they say there's no stupid questions but there's definitely some
[00:33:38.270] some stupid questions out there going back to how Crystal asked about following up with
[00:33:44.990] connections that you've made I was trying to think about it and the only times I've been in a position
[00:33:51.230] where I have to do that not like GC where she just got offered a job close but I feel like it's through
[00:33:57.150] family friends or friends of friends that I ended meeting where like you guys said they'll offer
[00:34:02.350] to like connect with you again and so it's never been through a number directly I think both
[00:34:07.790] times it's happened it's either been straight through LinkedIn and then we eventually we'll
[00:34:11.790] just set up a call damn I totally forgot that interacting with your family friends could also
[00:34:17.230] be networking because oftentimes at least in our parents generation I feel like those family
[00:34:22.670] friends are in higher up positions or at least have way more experience working in a certain
[00:34:28.350] industry than you so at the very least they will have tons of advice but also just objectively
[00:34:34.110] they could also be good connections so true actually my brother had a friend who studied what
[00:34:41.070] my dad works in which is double E and I remember one time my dad was hiring so he actually asked
[00:34:46.430] my brother he was like hey if you have any classmates or friends who you think are pretty
[00:34:50.510] hardworking and smart tell them they should apply for this position that I'm hiring for
[00:34:55.630] and so my brother told his friend to apply and you know they went through the interview
[00:34:59.870] and everything and my dad ended up really loving his application and interview and you
[00:35:05.390] know once he got hired my dad was like dude this guy's such a great worker I'm so glad
[00:35:09.230] that you told him to apply he's like one of my one of my best employees at the moment so definitely
[00:35:17.070] some valuable connections from family friends yeah I feel like basically one of those two times I've
[00:35:22.270] been able to connect the family friend or friend through my parents surprisingly just like what G.
[00:35:26.750] Susan he just happened to be like I think he was like a C. S. O. at like a biotech company
[00:35:31.710] at first my friends like oh this guy works in bio you should just meet him because they
[00:35:35.630] don't really know what I do and sometimes I don't know what I do but yeah it just happened to be that
[00:35:41.630] he actually works for like a pretty a pretty cool company that does similar stuff to what I work on
[00:35:46.350] this sort of worked out then he was like a just super personable guy so even though he had like that
[00:35:51.870] I guess level of expertise or he was like a higher up it was pretty chill that's awesome
[00:35:58.190] do you guys actually have any like do's and don'ts in regards to networking though
[00:36:04.110] what kind of immediately comes to mind for me is a big don't don't cold email people asking for
[00:36:13.950] referrals I think it's kind of off-putting if you ask someone who has no clue who you are
[00:36:20.750] for a referral into their company you know they don't know anything about you your work ethic
[00:36:26.750] who you are what you're good at past projects any of that kind of stuff so I feel like
[00:36:33.230] you know definitely don't cold call or email straight into a referral I think it's important to
[00:36:40.670] kind of build the rapport up first yeah I think a do from my experience would be to
[00:36:48.190] somewhat leverage your close friends and like people in your immediate network first
[00:36:53.870] even if you don't directly know someone who maybe works in the company that you want to go to
[00:36:58.350] one of your close friends might have a connection and even if it doesn't lead to like a referral at
[00:37:03.310] least having a conversation with someone could always be like super illuminating and helpful
[00:37:08.430] I feel like a don't is don't talk to that person and then like only ask stuff that might feel
[00:37:15.310] too pointed or like selfish almost like you I think you want to get to know the job
[00:37:18.830] in the company but also that person and what they do so not just being like oh can you
[00:37:22.990] give me info about ABCDE like TYI you know being a little bit more personable I think is super important
[00:37:30.430] totally agree with both of your do's and don'ts and yeah I think my do's are just the opposite of
[00:37:36.750] what chisel said not to do so like you just said if I don't know anyone like in my direct network
[00:37:42.350] that you know works at a particular place I'm looking at or like isn't the same position
[00:37:46.750] that I'm trying to get into going back like two years when I was looking for a job I basically
[00:37:51.950] find jobs that were just posted at companies that I liked reach out to a senior level at that company
[00:37:59.150] of that position and just sort of like you guys said like hey just just looking at chat
[00:38:04.110] I'm like a early professional and I you know I'd love to know what you did to get to your position
[00:38:09.310] blah blah blah I think I only did it like four or five times but of all those times those people
[00:38:14.350] have like been more than happy to refer me like right after that they'll naturally be like
[00:38:18.670] are you looking for a job it's like uh maybe like are you offering one yeah if you insist
[00:38:29.790] but yeah I feel like more often than not people are definitely very willing to help out
[00:38:35.470] one of the things that I remember so clearly is I think this was back in 2017 or 2018
[00:38:43.550] when subtle asian traits was still really big and people used facebook a decent amount still
[00:38:49.790] there was this kind of like spin-off of subtle asian traits it was subtle asian dating and
[00:38:55.630] this one girl she took advantage of that and she posted herself and she said hey forget about
[00:39:02.030] dating I'm looking for like job referrals um and she kind of like you know described herself
[00:39:08.350] and she was like hey if anyone is interested in giving me a job referral then let's connect and
[00:39:14.670] let's chat a bit and you know ultimately it's beneficial for both parties because the girl
[00:39:20.030] ends up getting a referral to a great tech company and then you know if the referral does
[00:39:24.910] go through usually there's some sort of incentive on the other side for the person who
[00:39:28.990] did the referring and you know it all worked out I'm like she got a lot of comments and a
[00:39:33.470] lot of people were really more than happy to chat with her and talk about her work and all that
[00:39:39.950] she changed the meta yeah I mean I yeah I think it just ties back to the reaching out
[00:39:45.710] worst thing they can say is no and I think we're eventually gonna get there but yeah
[00:39:49.790] it's just people are more than more than happy to help most of the time yeah I feel like
[00:39:53.870] both jobs I've had so far or all three I've had has been through people that I talked to
[00:39:58.510] beforehand and they happen to know somebody at the company or whatever and then I would always name
[00:40:04.750] drop them basically throughout all my interviews well thank you so much Harpreet for joining us
[00:40:14.510] today I feel like our conversation really helped me kind of shift my perspective on
[00:40:21.310] networking as I mentioned earlier in the episode I you know was kind of afraid of the word and
[00:40:26.350] and I always associated it with kind of like what Jisoo said transactions and super proper
[00:40:32.750] super professional environments but you know after we talked through it I'm realizing that
[00:40:38.270] networking can also be much more casual and comfortable so for our listeners out there
