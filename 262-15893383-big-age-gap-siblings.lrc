[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Destin.
[00:00:17.300] Welcome back, Destin. Last episode we had Destin on was episode 215, where he talks about
[00:00:23.900] his tattoo apprenticeship. And now Destin is a fully fledged tattoo artist, which is very cool to see.
[00:00:31.100] But we actually brought Destin on this week to talk about big age gaps in siblings. This is
[00:00:37.560] something that Jeesoo and I both do not have any experience with. So we thought it would be fun
[00:00:43.080] to pick your brain a little bit and confirm or question any theories that we personally have.
[00:00:52.300] Right. Jeesoo is a single child, right? And then you are a youngest child. Yeah.
[00:00:57.780] Yeah, I can tell. I can tell. But yes, please, I would love to answer any questions you guys have.
[00:01:04.840] So maybe Destin, you can give a little bit of background for our listeners who don't know you.
[00:01:10.780] Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with your siblings, as well as the different age
[00:01:16.500] gaps that you have with them? Right now I'm 28 years old. I have a younger brother who is 24.
[00:01:25.160] Then I have a younger half sister who is 14 years younger than me. So they are 14 right now. And
[00:01:34.160] they do go by they them, even though they are my sister. It's pretty interesting. You know,
[00:01:39.920] I'm sure Crystal remembers a lot when we were growing up in high school, like probably meeting
[00:01:44.540] my sister. It's like kind of interesting. I feel like when you go to your friend's house
[00:01:48.940] during like high school, you don't expect to be in like a baby environment. You know what I mean?
[00:01:53.960] Yeah.
[00:01:54.420] But yeah, like it was pretty interesting, especially when we were doing a lot of events for
[00:01:58.040] high school. And people would like come over and work on stuff at my house, like school projects or
[00:02:03.500] just, you know, homecoming stuff. There would just be a baby around. It was just like it just adds a
[00:02:08.120] little bit of like chaos.
[00:02:09.840] Oh my god, definitely. And it's crazy too, because your little sister, if they're 14 years younger,
[00:02:17.440] then that means they're about 14 years old now. And when we first met them, they were really young.
[00:02:25.020] Yeah, still in like diapers. Barely conscious.
[00:02:29.420] Yeah, exactly. Like they didn't even speak full sentences yet at some point. So to think that
[00:02:35.020] they're just walking the earth right now capable of forming sentences is crazy.
[00:02:40.400] Yeah. I mean, it's pretty interesting to think about it now because, you know, when you guys met
[00:02:44.920] them, we were like in high school and now they're a sophomore in high school right now. So I think it's
[00:02:50.840] pretty interesting kind of like the cycle and kind of seeing them because literally today they just
[00:02:55.820] had their sophomore homecoming day. Oh my god. So talking about homecoming is kind of like on topic
[00:03:02.180] right now. So if you were 14, when your sister was born, then you were like a fully conscious person.
[00:03:09.940] And I say that because when your brother was born, you were like four, which I feel like is a little bit
[00:03:15.820] young to be like fully sentient and making conscious active decisions. So do you think being
[00:03:21.620] a full fledged 14 year old when your sister was born changes the dynamic that you have with them
[00:03:26.560] versus with your brother? Were you more of an active participant in your relationship with your
[00:03:32.100] sister versus your brother? Yeah, I feel like four year age gap is pretty normal sibling age gap.
[00:03:37.760] So I feel like you kind of just are like kids together, you know, you're kind of like just doing
[00:03:42.360] dumb stuff, beating each other up, especially when you're like brothers and just like hit each other.
[00:03:47.600] I definitely feel like it's different when the age gap is so different because
[00:03:52.020] definitely you can't be like giving them like knuckle sandwiches and stuff, you know,
[00:03:58.260] you know, they can't fight back. No, I'm just kidding. But you watch them as like a baby and you know,
[00:04:03.420] you're helping your parents take care of them as a baby as well. So I'm not really going to be like,
[00:04:07.780] I was 14 and like take care of my sister. But you know, it's a different kind of responsibility,
[00:04:12.500] I think than being the responsibility of being a just a normal four year older brother. You have
[00:04:19.020] no responsibility there, to be honest. Do you see that in your brother as well? Like in your brother's
[00:04:25.100] relationship with your sister? Do you feel like he also is a little bit more gentle, maybe slightly more
[00:04:29.980] parental to your sister versus to you? Yeah, definitely. I kind of feel like we have different
[00:04:35.860] relationships with each other just because it was kind of just like a timing thing. I think when they
[00:04:41.000] were kind of like in elementary school, I left home for college. So I kind of wasn't hanging out
[00:04:48.020] with them around that time. But kind of in the later years of their elementary into middle school,
[00:04:54.980] I was at home and then my brother was in college. From seeing them grow up, I kind of feel like maybe
[00:05:00.200] those years when I was home, we're kind of more like formative for them. So I feel like just because
[00:05:07.480] I was there and like living at home with them at the time, I feel like me and my sister relationship,
[00:05:12.760] and then my brother and their relationship kind of like panned out a little differently,
[00:05:16.460] just because of us being at home at different times of their, I guess, like growing up and,
[00:05:21.300] you know, going through puberty as well. That makes total sense. I actually remember recently,
[00:05:26.480] I think it was this year, you sent a picture of your sister in our group chat and we were all like,
[00:05:31.160] oh my god, they're so big now. Like they're a real person. No longer a baby. Yeah. Going through
[00:05:38.120] high school, being interested in like trends, being on TikTok. Oh my god. Hearing them like use like
[00:05:43.980] skibbity, skibbity riz lingo on me. It's like, it's kind of crazy. Just it's crazy to see it like on
[00:05:52.320] TikTok, but then it's crazy to see it, I guess in your hometown life or in your home life.
[00:05:57.960] Oh my god, then are they like your source of Gen Z knowledge? I definitely see a lot of memes and
[00:06:05.040] stuff like that that I wouldn't normally see, but I'm glad I see some of the memes. They're really
[00:06:10.340] funny. Wait, actually, does your sister count as Gen Z or Gen Alpha? Do you know? Wait, Gen Alpha is
[00:06:16.920] younger, right? Yeah. I feel like they would be Gen Alpha. Do you think you feel a generation gap
[00:06:24.460] between you and your sister? Because that's actually two generations because we are
[00:06:30.340] selenials. I guess like one and a half generations. I would say so for sure. I don't know. There are a
[00:06:36.880] lot of similarities and there are a lot of differences. My sister is also kind of into like
[00:06:41.780] kind of the gaming scene and also like art. So I think a lot of stuff that we're into,
[00:06:47.040] there is some like overlap, but then there is a lot of differences as well. Like I know they play
[00:06:52.320] like a lot of Roblox, which I think is so interesting to me because I've never played this game before in
[00:06:58.440] my life. I've always Roblox. It sounds and looks like kind of like a silly game. It sounds like Legos,
[00:07:03.860] but nowadays I kind of see a lot of crazy content from Roblox where it doesn't even look like Roblox anymore.
[00:07:09.240] Right. That's just like its own tangent. But yeah, it's just really interesting to see them play.
[00:07:14.040] Like they're like, oh, I'm playing like the scary game on Roblox and now I'm playing with the shooting
[00:07:17.520] game. Oh my god. Oh, that's so interesting. Dude, we have a resident Roblox lover in this call.
[00:07:24.280] Yeah, I'm a casual Roblox enjoyer. Oh wait. So I can connect with your sister actually.
[00:07:30.520] That's how it's like kind of like similar, but like also like, at least for me, it's also different.
[00:07:35.500] Do you ever play Roblox with them? I think I tried once. It was like, okay, that's pretty interesting.
[00:07:41.600] Destin, you need to play Dress to Impress with them. Yeah. It's a must. Oh, that's a Roblox game? Oh, I've been hearing.
[00:07:48.980] Or they made a Roblox version. Okay, that's sick. Wait, what are you playing on Roblox, Jisoo?
[00:07:53.360] Yeah, just Dress to Impress, but it's like so fun. I'm obsessed. Okay, okay. I also feel like on TikTok,
[00:08:00.820] I'm scrolling, I see some sweaty kids playing Roblox, like FPS games. Oh wow. They're like
[00:08:05.860] doing like crazy flicks, like their mouths go crazy. I'm like, guys, this is just Roblox. But
[00:08:10.600] I also think a really interesting similarity is that they use Discord for everything, for like
[00:08:16.700] communication, which makes a lot of sense. Like Discord is a pretty great app, I think, for like
[00:08:21.420] a lot of different things, you know, servers and stuff. And it's really interesting because,
[00:08:25.280] you know, I use Discord a lot too, but I know I have a lot of friends, maybe from my generation that
[00:08:30.800] use different apps to talk. You know, there's Instagram, people communicate along Instagram,
[00:08:35.500] and then, you know, there's Messenger as well. Right. I know even for like people that are like
[00:08:40.780] five years younger than me, my Messenger notification will go off on my phone. They're
[00:08:45.040] like, there's no way you're on that app still. It's crazy. Wait, that's horrifying. Yeah.
[00:08:50.260] Does that mean we have to migrate out of Messenger? I don't know. No, literally people like my
[00:08:54.760] coworkers, they're only 25. They're like, dude, there's no way you use it. It's crazy. Ouch.
[00:09:00.880] So yeah, even if it's like 25, it's out of fashion. For 14 year olds, they're like only on Discord.
[00:09:06.840] They're like chopping it up in the Discord servers, you know, screen sharing them playing Roblox or
[00:09:12.160] like doing their math homework or something. Wait, screen sharing them doing math homework is crazy.
[00:09:18.320] I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Like new age cheating. I don't know if that's what kids would
[00:09:22.200] do, but wait, that's actually a genius. Yeah, if I were a kid, I probably would be doing that.
[00:09:27.320] We could crowdsource the homework together. Exactly. Everything's a good project.
[00:09:33.220] Doing it on Discord instead of doing it in the breaks between classes. Yeah, that's so interesting.
[00:09:39.360] But when I think about it, I think it does make a lot of sense because Discord has communities.
[00:09:43.540] So it's not just, you know, DMing or messaging. It's a forum almost as well. Like it's almost
[00:09:49.280] what Facebook was to us. I don't know how or like, I guess it's because it's like gaming adjacent that,
[00:09:54.880] you know, younger kids kind of migrate to it. But I assume like once a group of people at school,
[00:10:00.380] I guess start using Discord, it's like, oh, you know, I want to talk to them. So everyone else
[00:10:03.940] is going to migrate to them. So it's just cool to see how the different messaging norms
[00:10:10.060] Yeah. For that generation. Dude, is this like a cycle? Because for us, we used AIM. And that's like a chat,
[00:10:18.100] you know, dedicated chat app, if you can call it that. And Discord is technically that too.
[00:10:24.060] It's just a cycle. Like we're back to the chat apps. A little bit. I guess the Discord got big
[00:10:29.480] because of gaming. So I don't know what needs to get big for the next big thing. Maybe crypto or something.
[00:10:34.220] Oh, VR. I think. Oh, maybe. Oh my god, the next generation is going to be on VR chat with like
[00:10:42.840] avatars. There's log gone after school. And that's like the norm. So when you communicate with your
[00:10:49.700] sister, I assume a decent amount of that is at home. But outside of the house, are you texting them,
[00:10:55.860] chatting them? Or are you on Discord? It's either I'm texting them or using Discord. I don't know if
[00:11:01.960] that's like unusual. They also, a lot of times we'll just be like talking in memes. They'll just
[00:11:07.000] like send me a meme and then I'll just respond to a meme. No words even being said. I guess that's
[00:11:12.620] how the kids talk to you today. That's kind of cute. They think you're cool enough to send memes too.
[00:11:18.880] True. Yeah. I think that, you know, when you're like a kid in high school, you know,
[00:11:23.520] you have like a lot of like complaints that you have after school. So sometimes the few times I pick
[00:11:27.100] them up after school, I feel very grateful that, you know, they're very comfortable with being able
[00:11:31.780] to like tell me about their day, complaining about kids that made them mad or something throughout
[00:11:36.860] the day. That's so cute, actually. Well, this is kind of stupid, but I didn't realize your sibling
[00:11:42.680] could just pick you up from school. Oh yeah, it's crazy, right? That is like another thing that
[00:11:47.920] actually I've been thinking about is like when I was their age, starting in like middle school,
[00:11:53.040] I had to take the bus home and then walk up my hill by myself every single day. You know,
[00:12:01.360] because like there's more people in the house that are available to pick them up.
[00:12:05.780] But you know, there's a part of me that's like, oh, you know, back in my day, I had to,
[00:12:11.120] I had to find my own way home, you know, you have it good now. Oh my God. That's so true.
[00:12:17.620] And, and you didn't even start driving until a little later as well. Yeah. So it's like definitely
[00:12:24.100] part of me is like salty, but like, you know, part of me is like, you know, if I'm able to do it,
[00:12:29.260] I might as well, you know, try and make their life easier. They've got a cushy life thanks to you.
[00:12:35.040] A little bit. I mean, you guys wouldn't know, but I definitely think being the oldest sibling
[00:12:42.580] paves the way for younger siblings. Even with my brother, he was able to, you know, probably do things
[00:12:49.200] like get his license a little earlier than me, just because I mean, I can understand for parents,
[00:12:54.320] you know, the first kid making the leap for certain things is kind of like, it's big. But then once
[00:12:59.680] one kid has done it, I imagined it gets a lot easier. Yeah, I think I saw some Reddit comment
[00:13:05.000] from like a parent that was like, my first child is literally like, if I could, I would have bubble
[00:13:12.180] wrapped them like to send out into the world. But then by like the second and third child, it was just
[00:13:17.540] like, yeah, you know, they're probably okay, like whatever. That's actually a pretty interesting
[00:13:22.060] point. Because, you know, for my mom, I am my mom's first child. But actually, for my sister,
[00:13:28.560] my sister is my stepdad's first child. I can actually kind of see the differences because my
[00:13:34.220] mom is pretty like, hands off a little bit with my sister. Because you know, it is my mom's third child,
[00:13:41.020] not to say that she doesn't care about them. But you know, she's just definitely a little more laid back.
[00:13:45.640] And I can definitely see my stepdad being just more attentive and being on them.
[00:13:52.020] Oh, that is interesting. Your sister is the oldest sibling and the youngest sibling at the same time.
[00:13:58.860] A little bit. Yeah, it's, it's pretty interesting. I know that they've tried to ask my stepdad if like,
[00:14:05.140] they can take the bus too, you know, when they're when no one's able to take them home. But I feel like
[00:14:09.360] my stepdad's a little bit like, you know, first child is like, also, also they're a girl as well.
[00:14:15.060] So, so I feel like my stepdad's like, Oh, you know, might as well just get driven, you know,
[00:14:20.420] you don't need to take the bus.
[00:14:22.120] Right.
[00:14:25.360] So I guess as the oldest sibling in your family, do you feel like you do a lot of reflecting like
[00:14:31.400] that where you're like, comparing maybe your experiences growing up to your sisters or even
[00:14:36.220] your brothers? Definitely. I think just, it's like what I was saying earlier, like when I see
[00:14:40.520] them kind of have an easier time with certain things than I had it. I definitely probably was
[00:14:46.400] like salty about some stuff, but ultimately, you know, that's whatever. If I can make their life
[00:14:52.200] easier, I'm fine with it. Then when the difference is like so large between you and your sister,
[00:14:59.880] if there's stuff that maybe makes you a little salty, is it just easier to brush off or maybe not
[00:15:06.920] even be salty about now? Cause it's just so far in the past. Oh, well, I definitely think with my
[00:15:11.960] sister, there's a little bit of a difference because I feel like with my brother, you know,
[00:15:16.100] I kind of still think we're kind of like in the same generation or we're kind of like on an equal
[00:15:21.140] level a little bit, but like with my sister, it's like a little bit more of like a
[00:15:26.060] adult to child kind of like relationship. So there's a lot more like leeway or like, you know,
[00:15:32.240] I give a lot more like grace. Yeah. Then do you have a lot of feelings of like protectiveness
[00:15:39.160] around your sister? Cause I feel like that's kind of the natural next step, right? It's like you see
[00:15:43.460] the big age gap, you know, you're kind of in different generations and then you go into like
[00:15:48.040] protective bear mode. Um, when I think about it, I think the personality of my sister, I feel like
[00:15:54.880] they can kind of fend for themselves. They can solve their own problems. So I kind of feel like
[00:16:00.380] I trust them to be able to make their own good decisions. And I also feel like if they were on
[00:16:06.760] the fence about making a decision, they would feel comfortable enough to ask me about it. But I do think
[00:16:13.580] if their personality were maybe a little different, you know, I don't know what the personality would
[00:16:18.100] be, but you know, something that might feel like they can't maybe fend for themselves, maybe in
[00:16:23.440] like a school environment with like their peers or anything. Not that high school is dangerous.
[00:16:28.020] Maybe it is dangerous. No, I don't know. But yeah, maybe if they did have a personality like that,
[00:16:32.440] I could see myself maybe trying to be a little more protective.
[00:16:36.640] I feel like it just reminds me of, okay, now that I think about it, I don't know if this ever
[00:16:40.780] happened in real life, but telling on TV shows where kids are like, oh, well, my brother is older than
[00:16:46.560] your brother. My brother is way cooler. And then they go back and forth on whose brother is like the
[00:16:51.240] oldest. Your sister would win all of those battles because that 14 year age gap is pretty rare. I
[00:16:57.060] think that is a good point. I definitely think like, I remember when they were like a kid, you know,
[00:17:02.240] when you're, when you're a kid and in like probably like preschool, kindergarten, they always ask you
[00:17:07.140] like, oh, who are your role models? And I think, you know, they would, they would like write about me
[00:17:12.040] and like my parents a lot too. Yeah. So I definitely think they appreciate that. And they
[00:17:20.080] think it's like cool having such older siblings. And also they are interested in art. I'd like to
[00:17:26.420] believe that I can be like a good role model or like, you know, show them maybe what is possible
[00:17:32.260] about what you can do through art. It makes me feel proud that, you know, they can be like,
[00:17:37.880] oh, my brother is like so, so old and cool. No, not the old part. I mean, also, I bet it's hella cool
[00:17:45.500] for your sister to be able to say something like, dude, my brother is like a tattoo artist. There's not
[00:17:51.260] a lot of people who could probably say that in high school. Yeah. I don't, I don't know if they do,
[00:17:55.400] but I can imagine them bragging about it. It's whatever though. They always are like, oh, when I'm 18,
[00:18:03.040] I'm gonna let you tattoo me. I'm like, okay, you're gonna get me in trouble. But okay.
[00:18:11.080] So I guess growing up, my high school friend group was all girls. And a lot of us had older brothers,
[00:18:18.660] not quite the 14 year age gap, but maybe like six to eight years or so. I remember one of those days
[00:18:25.000] in high school, I met my friend's older brother, and he had a kid. And I just was so shocked to like
[00:18:31.220] meet a real adult, you know, who looked just like my friend. And it was just like such an iconic
[00:18:36.580] moment that I still remember it like very vividly. Like we were in my friend's garage,
[00:18:39.960] and I like shook his hand. But you know, your sister, now that they're a sophomore in high school,
[00:18:45.280] they're kind of getting to that age. So like, have you ever met your sister's friends? Do you think
[00:18:49.900] you've ever had a moment like that, but the reverse? I feel like my sister's friends are like shy. So
[00:18:55.200] I feel like when I sometimes I like will pick them up, and then I'll drive their friends as well.
[00:19:01.060] I don't know if it's just like being a kid around like older adults, you're just like,
[00:19:05.280] don't really like talk that much. Or you just like talks amongst yourselves. It's I feel like
[00:19:09.140] that's like a teenager thing. You know, they're like in their own bubble. When you're like an adult,
[00:19:13.740] you're like, Oh, you're too old for this bubble. So you're not gonna you're not gonna get the skibity,
[00:19:18.100] you know, we got too much for you over here. Dustin, you're literally like the parent picking.
[00:19:24.620] Yeah, cool. Driving their friends around. Do you ever drive them to like the mall?
[00:19:30.220] Do kids still do that? Hang out at the mall? I have gone to the mall with my sister maybe like
[00:19:35.460] once or twice in the last year just to like hang out, you know? So I still think the mall is a cool
[00:19:40.540] thing. I also think my girlfriend, Amber is an only child. Amber and my sister will like hang out,
[00:19:49.020] we'll all hang out pretty often. Amber will like note certain things that I'll do. She'll be like,
[00:19:55.820] oh, that's so like caring or like so patient of you. And I'm like, dang, must be nice being an only
[00:20:02.660] child, you know? No, I'm just kidding. But I don't know. I don't know. Man, the mess up thing is that
[00:20:10.400] both Jisoo and James are only children. So yeah, that is... Yeah, stay with your chest.
[00:20:17.700] That's so funny. Trying to talk shit. You guys have no one, you guys have no one to keep you guys in
[00:20:23.880] check or to show you what it's like on the other side of the lawn. I was kind of thinking like your
[00:20:31.620] sister being low-key the oldest and the youngest sibling at the same time. I wonder if that's what
[00:20:38.720] being an only child is like, like you're super protected by your parents, but at the same time,
[00:20:44.060] you're well taken care of because it's like, oh, this is my only child. Yeah, I guess so. I feel
[00:20:50.380] like I have felt like that. It's like baby of the family, but I have to fend for myself when I go
[00:20:55.720] outside and my friends aren't there. So I don't like this laughing.
[00:21:02.960] No, this is funny.
[00:21:05.400] Oh, I think it's so funny that Amber points out, wow, Destin, like that's so patient of you or like
[00:21:11.100] so caring of you. I think it's also extra funny because Destin's attitude usually, you know, just
[00:21:17.520] outwardly with us close friends and stuff, it's very nonchalant, super chill. And so it's like,
[00:21:23.080] I'm sure seeing you with your younger siblings, being an older sibling to them is like a whole
[00:21:28.740] new perspective. Yeah. I definitely feel like there's like a shift. I think when, you know,
[00:21:34.100] I have to be around my younger sister and then like when I'm with people normally in my age,
[00:21:40.080] for example, at my work, we have some events at the tattoo shop. I can imagine when you're like a kid
[00:21:46.300] in high school, like being able to go to like events like this is like super fun. So I have them
[00:21:52.180] accompany me a lot when I'm like tabling at these events. Not to say that I have to censor myself,
[00:21:57.780] but I just like, it's an interesting clash of worlds. It's kind of like my co workers. But then
[00:22:03.740] I'm also like here as like my sister's older brother and also kind of a little bit like their chaperone.
[00:22:10.220] Right? Well, so do you try not I mean, I'm trying to understand what you mean by censor like censor
[00:22:14.860] the types of jokes you make? Or do you try not to cuss? Or like, what is it that you're censoring?
[00:22:19.260] I think a little bit like that. I'm still kind of like working. So I'm still trying to be
[00:22:24.180] professional. But I think I have to a little bit like keep an eye on them, make sure they're like
[00:22:29.180] entertained and make sure they're like still alive, still at the venue.
[00:22:33.440] Still alive.
[00:22:35.280] I guess kind of like just keep an eye on them. But then also kind of like,
[00:22:38.920] you know, still be doing the stuff that I need to do.
[00:22:41.600] Oh my god, it's literally bring your child to work day.
[00:22:44.060] Wait, yeah.
[00:22:46.600] I appreciate though that I share like this kind of like, you know,
[00:22:50.760] unconventional and like the fun parts of this interesting industry with them. My co workers
[00:22:56.340] are all like younger people. And they're like all like artists and like do interesting things.
[00:23:00.760] So I think it's like pretty cool that I can just like introduce them to all these kinds of different
[00:23:04.680] people as well that have these like jobs that you probably wouldn't even imagine can be a job
[00:23:11.000] in high school. That's super cool. Your sister has a good living the life a good life, man.
[00:23:18.680] Do you ever find yourself saying stuff to your sister that could potentially lean luxury?
[00:23:24.660] Oh my god. Like, oh, remember to do this before you go to school. Like don't forget to do this.
[00:23:29.620] Make sure you're taking care of your health like that kind of stuff that I feel like parents often
[00:23:33.360] talk about. I think I try not to be a luxury with them. But I do think there is this kind of like
[00:23:40.680] line where it's like, we're like joking and then it's like, oh, I'm trying to be like serious with
[00:23:46.220] you and you have to like listen to me. I think like one specific thing was when we were like on vacation
[00:23:52.220] one time together and it was just me and them hanging out. I just think like for whatever reason,
[00:23:58.020] I was getting annoyed at them. I don't know what they were doing, but waffling around like just being
[00:24:03.040] a teenager. You know, normally when I talk to them, usually it's pretty chill and we're like always
[00:24:08.640] joking and everything. But I think I said something like, okay, I'm getting kind of annoyed now. Can
[00:24:14.900] you stop? Can you stop talking, talking like that? And I just need to like chill for a bit.
[00:24:20.220] And they're like, oh, so there is that kind of, I don't know how to say it, but it's like this line
[00:24:25.840] of being serious. And then like, you have to take me seriously now and listen to me. And it's just like
[00:24:32.100] sometimes when I think they're being kind of a teenager. And I think when you're a teenager,
[00:24:37.140] you think you're like on top of the world, you're like invincible. Everything in your head is the right
[00:24:43.320] answer. And you know, sometimes, sometimes I think when that comes out of them, I can get a little
[00:24:49.800] irritated. But most of the time I try not to express it. But sometimes, sometimes I feel like
[00:24:55.540] I have to say something. So that's like put them in their place a little bit. And that's like that line.
[00:25:02.160] I'm trying to be serious. And I'm not trying to make a joke or anything. I'm just trying to say
[00:25:06.960] something, you know, hopefully I think is helpful for them. That's so interesting because I feel like
[00:25:14.180] based on my long standing sibling studies, siblings are usually so like, okay with,
[00:25:23.320] I don't want to say okay with fighting, but it kind of is like being okay with conflict or like
[00:25:28.280] calling each other out, right? Like, I feel like maybe that's the relationship that you might have
[00:25:32.000] with your brother, where if he's being annoying, maybe you would be a little bit more blunt and be like,
[00:25:36.280] okay, shut up or something. But it sounds like you wouldn't ever say that to your sister.
[00:25:41.220] I think we would feel comfortable with saying stuff how it is. I just think we normally don't
[00:25:49.000] have conflict. I do think they're in that stage where they want to just kind of do their own thing,
[00:25:55.400] you know, talk to their friends online, hang out in their room and, you know, high school life.
[00:26:00.320] So I'm not like super involved in their day to day life. I think if I was maybe there would be
[00:26:06.160] more conflict. Yeah, I guess it's like the idea that you handle conflict with your sister more
[00:26:13.100] maturely, I guess, or with more patience versus your brother who is more similar to us in terms of age
[00:26:22.680] and generation. So it feels like you can just be almost more immature with them, right?
[00:26:28.220] Yeah, not as gentle. Yeah, with advice. I definitely think when I'm like trying to bring
[00:26:35.900] up something to my sister, I'm like thinking of how to like carefully word it because I feel like I
[00:26:42.900] want to word it in a way where, you know, this is an issue and I want you to like listen and like take
[00:26:48.020] it seriously. But I'm not like angry. I'm not like fuming. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm
[00:26:58.200] I feel like it's a very unique position to be in almost because when you're the active parent
[00:27:04.740] dealing with your kid, I think there is a little bit more immediate emotional investment. Not to
[00:27:10.760] say that you're not invested in your sister's life, but it's more so like, okay, this is my direct child.
[00:27:15.780] The entire weight of this person's life lies on my shoulders. But with you, it's almost like you can
[00:27:22.420] take a step back when you need to, but also be involved when you need to. So I feel like it's
[00:27:27.040] a cool position to be in and kind of a rare relationship too. It's like you can kind of
[00:27:31.860] control the closeness and like the delicateness, I guess, of the relationship. That's actually a
[00:27:37.320] really interesting way to put it. I think it is really cool because I can have all the good parts,
[00:27:43.760] I guess, of like having a new like member of the family, you know, you know, they're like super cute.
[00:27:50.420] I can play with them. I can, you know, hang out with them when they're not crying. But then when,
[00:27:54.960] you know, when they are crying, when they, when they're like going, you know, when they're getting
[00:27:59.400] picked up from school, going to school, getting their lunch packed, you know, I'm not like super
[00:28:04.720] involved with them, you know, I can kind of like let my parents deal with it. So it definitely is
[00:28:09.360] kind of like a, kind of like a nice opportunity to have them very grateful for. Something that I
[00:28:15.620] think is interesting that I just remembered when my sister was a little younger, they would argue a lot
[00:28:21.180] with my stepdad. So when things got a little too heated, it was interesting that they would run to
[00:28:27.740] me kind of like talk to me. So I think in that sense, I would I did kind of become like the third
[00:28:33.780] parent. Oh, so that was pretty interesting. And then you know, even my stepdad would be like, Oh,
[00:28:39.820] I kind of got an argument with them. So if you can help them talk to them and like help them feel
[00:28:46.260] better, that'd be great. Wow, that's so cute. Yeah. It's kind of like at work when you have a real boss
[00:28:52.640] and then you have like a mentor. A little bit. I do feel like maybe my position is a little bit of like
[00:29:00.020] a mentor, mentor slash friend. Wow. So would you say that your sister leans on you more than they
[00:29:06.960] lean on your brother? Definitely. No, I definitely think that they would probably say that as well.
[00:29:13.120] I kind of attribute that to what I was saying earlier, like, in their like kind of like more
[00:29:17.980] formative, maybe like rebellious years. That's when I was like at home and my brother was in college.
[00:29:22.860] I also feel like in general, my brother just kind of like sticks his own thing.
[00:29:26.480] And I do think like with the art thing as well, it helps us connect on that.
[00:29:30.720] Oh, yeah, that makes sense. When you were 14, how did your mom tell you that you had a new sibling
[00:29:37.660] coming? This was so long ago. Was it like impactful? Or was it just like, oh, okay.
[00:29:45.220] I think it was more so impactful when my mom told us that she was getting remarried. I think that was
[00:29:52.460] more of the impactful part. And then I think her having a kid was kind of like expected. So I don't
[00:29:59.100] really think it was that super impactful. But maybe more so the remarrying that was that impactful part.
[00:30:06.660] I think that makes sense. You're more shocked about the remarriage part. And then when she's like,
[00:30:11.700] oh, I'm gonna have a kid, you guys are gonna have a sibling. You're kind of like, okay, well,
[00:30:16.060] I guess that just follows marriage naturally.
[00:30:18.240] Yeah, I kind of feel like if I had to think about it, we were maybe like kind of excited about it.
[00:30:24.620] Even, you know, whenever we were able to find out that my sister was a girl, they're non-binary now.
[00:30:32.660] But when we found out that they were a girl, me and my brother had never had a sister. And I know my
[00:30:40.440] mom also wanted a daughter. So I think everyone was pretty excited.
[00:30:46.220] Oh, that's cute. That is cute. I also wonder if it's because you had each other already. Like,
[00:30:52.060] I feel like going from an only child to having a sibling is like a huge leap. But having one sibling
[00:30:57.980] to having two siblings maybe wouldn't be as shocking. Right? Yeah, I can kind of imagine
[00:31:03.400] that if you went from having no siblings to one sibling, it would be pretty shocking. But it's
[00:31:10.260] not as bad because you don't need to like share your stuff as much because you know,
[00:31:14.200] there's not much stuff that can be shared between siblings that are of a 14 year age again.
[00:31:18.860] Oh, yeah. You know, you're not like sharing food,
[00:31:20.740] like baby food or not sharing like, like clothes or like toys and playtime. You know,
[00:31:26.860] you don't even share like time on the video game. Something that was pretty interesting being 14
[00:31:32.160] and having a sibling that young was that like, you know, when you have a sibling kind of like takes
[00:31:39.260] up all the attention from your parents for better or for worse. I think I had a very like independent
[00:31:45.020] teenage life. You know, I was kind of like doing my own thing. Kind of had free reign over what I
[00:31:50.820] wanted to do. Maybe that was a bad thing. But it's okay. You turned out okay. Yeah. But I mean,
[00:31:58.760] I think I had a fun teenager life. So I think I'm grateful for it. But yeah, that was a pretty
[00:32:03.560] interesting byproduct of having a sibling at that age. That's true. Now that I think about it,
[00:32:09.520] sometimes when we went to hang out at your place, your sister might have been sleeping,
[00:32:15.020] or we didn't always see them running around because they were literally just like a toddler
[00:32:20.740] or a baby. And so I feel like your parents were usually very busy with your sister as well. So
[00:32:28.360] yeah, when I envisioned Destin, teenage Destin, it's kind of what you described. Destin's always
[00:32:34.340] free to do whatever he wants. So we talked a little bit about how you took care of your sister a little
[00:32:41.280] bit when she was young. Do you know how to like change a diaper and stuff? Like how extensive is
[00:32:46.680] your knowledge of taking care of a baby slash toddler? Don't think I ever changed their diaper.
[00:32:55.180] And you know, it's been a very long time since they've worn diapers. So I don't even think probably
[00:33:00.440] my parents know. But yeah, like I was saying earlier, of course, my parents did a lot of the
[00:33:05.500] changing diapers, cleaning up poop, putting them to sleep, feeding them and everything.
[00:33:11.120] In terms of, you know, taking care of them, at least now it's just mostly like helping them with
[00:33:16.620] going places, you know, driving them places. I remember I taught them math for a little bit,
[00:33:22.320] which was pretty infuriating. No.
[00:33:27.540] Yeah, I taught them school subjects. And that was pretty, you know, helpful for my parents,
[00:33:32.700] because, you know, they're not familiar with the school subjects as well as I am, you know,
[00:33:37.280] because it's pretty like, relatively more recent in knowledge, especially since I also went to
[00:33:41.960] the same high school as them. So I would help them a lot. But that was also like another thing where
[00:33:48.940] it's like, I'm not like joking around as much. It's kind of like I'm trying to teach you like math,
[00:33:54.680] you need to like learn how to do this formula. Oh my god, I'm just imagining you trying to teach
[00:33:59.700] them math. And they're like, Oh my god, look at these memes.
[00:34:05.320] Yeah, when I'm teaching them stuff, of course, when you're like learning something, it's going to be
[00:34:09.500] like difficult. You know, you see a very different side of them when they're like trying their best
[00:34:14.600] to do something and maybe it's not like working out. Yeah, that's just a different thing that I
[00:34:19.740] don't normally see day to day, you know, because we're normally just like joking a lot.
[00:34:23.500] And then also just like, you know, advice, talking to people like, you know, in high school and stuff.
[00:34:28.600] That's also something that my parents probably cannot help as well because they don't know
[00:34:33.160] being a teenager and being like in high school as well as I do.
[00:34:37.760] Oh my god, have you ever made them cry?
[00:34:40.640] I actually don't think I have.
[00:34:42.920] Okay, I was kind of thinking that because if your age gap is like so large,
[00:34:46.860] there's also I think more respect coming from the younger sibling.
[00:34:51.700] Well, hopefully. And I feel like there's
[00:34:54.820] less opportunity, I guess, to make each other cry
[00:34:58.900] just because you being kind of a mature adult
[00:35:02.880] now, it's like, oh, I'll try to be gentle with
[00:35:05.580] them and like not be too harsh.
[00:35:09.280] Meanwhile, I'm, you know, like having a sibling that's much closer in age,
[00:35:13.120] I feel like me and my brother.
[00:35:15.500] Okay, I don't know if I ever made him cry, but like he definitely has made me cry.
[00:35:21.380] Yeah, definitely.
[00:35:22.600] What did he do that made you cry?
[00:35:24.600] I don't know. Just like be mean.
[00:35:27.320] Damn.
[00:35:30.380] I have a kind of a funny question for you both.
[00:35:33.540] If your parents came up to you right now and were like,
[00:35:38.140] were expecting a child,
[00:35:41.000] whoa, how would you feel about having a sibling
[00:35:45.180] with a 28 year age gap?
[00:35:48.700] Oh my god.
[00:35:51.440] I mean, at this point, it's like training us for parenthood, right?
[00:35:55.940] At this point?
[00:35:56.660] Yeah.
[00:35:58.800] You know, for Jisoo, she doesn't even have siblings.
[00:36:01.320] So she might as well treat this as a child.
[00:36:04.100] There's no point in trying to learn what it's like to be a sibling.
[00:36:09.060] True.
[00:36:09.900] Yeah, it's like not even a sibling anymore.
[00:36:11.940] It's just your child.
[00:36:14.180] Your child adjacent.
[00:36:15.940] What would I think?
[00:36:16.780] I would think that it would be really funny for my sister
[00:36:19.880] because now they get to, I guess, experience the same thing
[00:36:26.260] that I went through.
[00:36:27.700] Not that it was a bad thing, but just this very unique experience
[00:36:31.600] of having such a large age gap sibling.
[00:36:35.240] Yeah, because then when they're like 28,
[00:36:38.200] then the fourth and final sibling would be 14.
[00:36:42.140] Oh my god.
[00:36:44.060] Jisoo's like so in shock.
[00:36:45.440] She can't even answer this question about it.
[00:36:47.960] I know.
[00:36:48.340] I'm speechless.
[00:36:50.800] I mean, honestly, I would be like, okay, at that point,
[00:36:53.520] this is, like Dustin said, just my kid.
[00:36:56.060] I will be taking care of this new soul.
[00:36:58.540] But also, you guys know Al Pacino?
[00:37:02.680] Yeah.
[00:37:03.120] He had a kid at 83.
[00:37:06.540] Whoa.
[00:37:07.400] And he has multiple kids already.
[00:37:10.260] So low-key, his children are probably going through that
[00:37:13.480] where his oldest kid is maybe like 40 or some shit.
[00:37:16.520] That is kind of how families of celebrities work, right?
[00:37:20.500] A lot of celebrities remarry a lot
[00:37:23.160] and then will have a new child with their new spouse.
[00:37:27.060] So that's kind of normal for that side of the world.
[00:37:31.500] Yeah.
[00:37:32.780] Okay, but also, Jisoo,
[00:37:34.320] like you wouldn't be taking care of that sibling
[00:37:36.740] because your parents live in a different state.
[00:37:40.340] So when you visit, like that would be a sibling.
[00:37:43.440] Oh.
[00:37:44.160] I guess that's true.
[00:37:46.520] God, I don't know.
[00:37:47.940] At that point, you're just like cousins.
[00:37:49.680] Oh my god.
[00:37:50.540] You're siblings, but you treat them like a cousin.
[00:37:53.720] And then it's crazy because like every time you see them,
[00:37:56.420] they're like a different person, you know?
[00:37:58.020] They grow up like a whole year.
[00:37:59.780] And then at that age, they're like a different,
[00:38:02.120] they're like a completely different person from year to year.
[00:38:05.600] Dude, but would you not like get jealous?
[00:38:07.880] You go home, your parents are like fawning over this child.
[00:38:11.580] Like what about you?
[00:38:13.720] No, I have experience because we used to have a dog.
[00:38:16.700] So, you know, it's like the same thing.
[00:38:19.280] Right.
[00:38:19.720] Well, I guess, Jisoo, how would you feel if your parents were to give this child something,
[00:38:26.580] like I said, easier or like earlier than they did for you?
[00:38:31.440] Would you feel like resentful?
[00:38:33.320] Or would you be like, I'm happy that they could have it this easy?
[00:38:39.500] God, I don't know.
[00:38:40.440] I mean, I'm sure there are things that I can think of that would make me feel resentful.
[00:38:44.540] I can't pinpoint any right now, but I think I would feel resentful.
[00:38:48.820] But I feel so uncomfortable right now.
[00:38:50.480] This is crazy.
[00:38:51.440] I feel like I haven't had to think about the thought of,
[00:38:54.940] oh, how would you feel if your parents asked if you wanted a sibling in so long?
[00:39:00.100] What is your gut feeling imagining your parents saying to this child,
[00:39:05.240] I'm proud of you?
[00:39:06.560] What?
[00:39:16.440] That's crazy.
[00:39:20.660] Yeah, I would probably be uncomfortable.
[00:39:22.920] Okay.
[00:39:23.380] Actually, what would make me uncomfortable is not like the things or like, you know, the words.
[00:39:27.640] But if I were to go back home and be like, hey, mom and dad, me right now,
[00:39:31.740] they would be super happy to see me.
[00:39:33.380] But if I went back and they were just like so preoccupied with this baby,
[00:39:37.420] I would be like, what the fuck?
[00:39:39.340] I'm here.
[00:39:40.080] Like, it's just a fucking baby.
[00:39:43.880] Dude, they would definitely be like, oh, hey, Jisoo, you're back.
[00:39:48.020] And immediately put you to work.
[00:39:49.980] No, your parents?
[00:39:50.840] No, you should be like, dude, you barely know this person.
[00:39:54.080] You've known them for two years.
[00:39:55.800] You've known me for 28 years.
[00:39:58.120] There's no way.
[00:39:59.900] There's no way you like them that much.
[00:40:02.740] I'm like, dude, broke any of the lock yet.
[00:40:05.240] Like, the fuck?
[00:40:06.860] They can't even say a word.
[00:40:08.160] What conversation can this guy even hold?
[00:40:13.120] That would be crazy, though, because something that Jisoo said earlier rings true.
[00:40:18.720] Like, Dustin, you have pretty much always been the older sibling.
[00:40:23.100] Because when you find out when you're four, you're like barely conscious.
[00:40:27.000] You're like barely realizing the weight of that.
[00:40:30.060] So technically, like your whole life, you've been the older sibling.
[00:40:34.320] But in the case of, you know, bigger age gaps, if there's only two siblings, then the older sibling, you know, spent X amount of years being an only child.
[00:40:44.280] And then they have to start learning to be an older sibling, which is kind of crazy to think about.
[00:40:49.800] Yeah.
[00:40:51.180] Yeah.
[00:40:51.300] What would the things that you have to do?
[00:40:52.920] It's like sharing, but then, you know, when the age gap is that big, you're not sharing stuff.
[00:40:57.360] Maybe being like, maybe being like patient.
[00:41:01.060] Yeah.
[00:41:01.460] I don't know.
[00:41:02.800] I say it like that, but it's just things that, you know, that I've noticed my girlfriend know from me.
[00:41:12.620] No, I think that's absolutely right.
[00:41:14.600] Being patient.
[00:41:15.940] And there's just like little things.
[00:41:17.940] So my boyfriend is an older sibling as well.
[00:41:21.040] And their age gap is about four years as well.
[00:41:25.580] Sometimes his younger sister will call him when she doesn't know what to do.
[00:41:30.880] And I was like, oh, that's like kind of cute.
[00:41:33.260] But I was also like, I would never do that.
[00:41:35.600] Like I would never call my older brother in times of need.
[00:41:39.500] For the most part, I don't have a reason to.
[00:41:42.560] But she was like literally calling him for like advice.
[00:41:45.600] I thought about it.
[00:41:46.420] I was like, wow, that's like such little sibling behavior.
[00:41:48.780] Like it's very cute, you know?
[00:41:50.880] Yeah.
[00:41:51.840] Have you ever taken note of anything that your boyfriend does that is like, oh, I've never thought of doing that?
[00:41:59.620] I guess that's one thing.
[00:42:00.780] But he takes his younger sister like grocery shopping and like drives her around and stuff.
[00:42:07.900] And I'm like, that's very nice of you.
[00:42:12.780] Actually, I think Crystal, you did take your older brother grocery shopping and like drive him around.
[00:42:18.040] Well, not grocery shopping, but I did learn to drive earlier in my lifetime than he did.
[00:42:25.160] So in college, we both went to UCSD and I basically took ownership of the car.
[00:42:31.900] But I think that's an older sibling thing.
[00:42:35.300] Like Max just let me like take ownership of the car because by that time he he could drive as well.
[00:42:41.680] But he never complained and just let me like always use the car pretty much.
[00:42:48.440] Once Max asked me to take him to Zion and drive him around.
[00:42:51.780] Oh my God.
[00:42:52.600] Wait, that's so funny.
[00:42:54.720] That's really funny.
[00:42:56.320] Because we all live together.
[00:42:57.940] Yeah.
[00:42:58.900] Dude, that was your moment of older siblingship.
[00:43:03.440] Was it?
[00:43:04.280] Oh, like I was older.
[00:43:05.460] Yeah, you're right.
[00:43:08.320] Okay.
[00:43:08.980] So last question for you, Dustin.
[00:43:11.560] You have quite a lot of experience with siblings in your own personal family.
[00:43:17.180] So when you think about having your own children, do you think you want to have three kids just like your family?
[00:43:25.900] Or what do you think the ideal setup is?
[00:43:29.900] I definitely do not want an only child.
[00:43:36.600] For L for not just me, but for your girlfriend, for my husband.
[00:43:40.880] That sounds like such a mean thing to say.
[00:43:46.360] I think growing up with siblings, you just like learn a lot.
[00:43:50.800] It's like the saying.
[00:43:52.180] I don't know if you've heard of this lifelong saying, but is it easier to take care of one dog or nine dogs?
[00:43:58.220] Oh, it's like the same basically.
[00:43:59.760] Yeah, is it easier to take care of one kid or nine kids?
[00:44:03.640] Because when it's nine kids...
[00:44:04.920] One.
[00:44:05.360] Okay.
[00:44:05.980] It doesn't work the same as kids, but you know, nine dogs, they kind of take care of each other.
[00:44:11.140] It's spoken by someone that's never owned a dog.
[00:44:13.760] But yeah, I think ideally my envision, if I were to have kids, I'm still not sure if I will have kids.
[00:44:21.720] But I think I would want probably two children, maybe three.
[00:44:27.160] Okay, I've never taken care of actual my own children yet, but I think having siblings for your children would be very helpful for everyone.
[00:44:37.440] And, you know, of course, I think it's very fun as well.
[00:44:39.960] Would you give them a big age gap?
[00:44:42.800] Oh, that's kind of interesting.
[00:44:43.980] If I could have the choice.
[00:44:45.980] I mean, that's not really like a choice thing, right?
[00:44:48.960] It's not something you plan for.
[00:44:50.640] Right, right.
[00:44:51.440] True.
[00:44:52.660] Wait, age gap I think you can definitely plan for.
[00:44:56.040] Or at least try to plan for.
[00:44:58.420] It's not like gender choosing.
[00:45:00.520] Okay, okay.
[00:45:01.000] Let me think if I could like build my life and plan to have...
[00:45:05.160] Honestly, maybe it's like not bad because it's like the youngest sibling.
[00:45:09.560] You know, you have older siblings to help take care of them.
[00:45:13.460] And they're like, you know, they're old enough where you don't need to be cleaning out their poop.
[00:45:16.760] So they can start cleaning up poop.
[00:45:19.700] So...
[00:45:20.260] That's true.
[00:45:20.800] It's like a little less chaotic at once.
[00:45:23.680] Honestly, the idea of it does not sound bad.
[00:45:26.740] But also the idea of, you know, having children and then being in parenthood and being like 15 years in like, all right, let's do it again.
[00:45:37.500] Like that is what sounds a little crazy.
[00:45:42.040] Honestly, yeah.
[00:45:43.080] It's like restarting a game after you've gone so far.
[00:45:46.740] A little bit.
[00:45:47.340] That is more of the crazy thing to fathom.
[00:45:51.280] But I think the actual sibling relationship would be not bad.
[00:45:54.920] I think it would be pretty good.
[00:45:56.700] Well, as an only child, I felt like I took some L's this episode.
[00:46:00.760] But it was very interesting to hear a little bit about your relationship with your sister and how the big age gap plays a role in your relationship.
