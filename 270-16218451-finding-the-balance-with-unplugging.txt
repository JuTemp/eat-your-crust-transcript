[00:00:00.240] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust Podcast. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Crystal. And I'm Balmeet.
[00:00:17.030] Welcome Balmeet. Balmeet is a new voice on the podcast and we wanted to bring him on to chat about
[00:00:25.710] unplugging and kind of also balancing your life with all of this technology constantly around us.
[00:00:33.410] I think it's more and more on our minds lately, thinking about how to be more productive,
[00:00:41.350] how to like rot on the bed and couch less and not get so sucked into social media and technology and
[00:00:49.450] all of that stuff. So we thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss. So I guess to start
[00:00:54.850] us off on a scale of one to 10, how chronically online do you think you are? Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:01:02.330] And I was thinking about this, probably like a seven or eight, which I don't know if that's the
[00:01:07.750] number that you were expecting per se. But I was thinking about it. What do I do where I don't
[00:01:14.890] necessarily go online? Like social media is an obvious one where, you know, keep track of people's
[00:01:19.330] lives where you just kind of like doom scrolling, rotting on the couch. Media, like in terms of sports
[00:01:26.810] or politics or whatever, you get most of that stuff online. Or at least I do games, shopping,
[00:01:33.650] I do a lot of stuff online, all of my hobbies, I kind of have a an avenue online. So I'm into climbing,
[00:01:41.130] I got into chess, like during COVID. Those are some of the YouTubers I follow. And like, whenever
[00:01:46.030] they come up with a video, like I'll keep track of that. There are a lot of things where I would say
[00:01:49.330] that I'm chronically online for. But maybe just that's just how technology is today. We kind of
[00:01:55.950] use technology to get what you need for your different interests or your different needs.
[00:02:01.490] Yeah, that's a good point. I feel like as much as technology is supposed to be a tool for us,
[00:02:07.150] it can just be a tool for us. But then my chronically online piece comes from always
[00:02:13.130] craving that screen time or like wanting that screen time. And sometimes I've had experiences
[00:02:18.490] where I'm at my computer for a long time. And I'm like, Oh, damn, my eyes hurt. Like I'm a little
[00:02:22.350] tired, I should go rest. And then I'll lay down on the couch and pull up my phone, you know.
[00:02:26.550] So then in that sense, I feel like I'm probably like an eight or a nine.
[00:02:30.770] My screen time is pretty high. So it's a tough addiction to be.
[00:02:36.010] Honestly, I'm probably similar to all of you floating around that upper end of seven to
[00:02:42.150] eight or eight or nine. I spend a lot of screen time playing games watching TV. After I watch TV,
[00:02:49.230] I have to like read about it, browse Reddit or like Twitter or whatever and see what everyone else is
[00:02:54.790] saying. Especially if it's like a good show. Sometimes the content that the viewers create
[00:03:00.590] is just as good as the show itself. It's easy to get really sucked into all of that.
[00:03:05.810] Sometimes I think about it too. I'm like, what am I even doing online? What am I reading? What am I
[00:03:10.230] wasting my time doing? And you can't even think of a topic. It's just like substance list sometimes.
[00:03:16.790] But that's just how it is.
[00:03:18.570] Yeah, I would definitely agree with that. I just finished watching Arcane. And the first thing I
[00:03:22.530] did is just go on Reddit just to see what other people are saying about it.
[00:03:25.270] Yeah, totally. I've been reading so much about Arcane on like Reddit and Twitter and all of that.
[00:03:30.770] People love to post theories, analyses, make fan art and make funny observations as well.
[00:03:38.590] You go in thinking like, let me read a bit of what people are discussing. And the next thing you know,
[00:03:42.890] it's like four hours have passed and you're like, what have I been doing?
[00:03:45.770] I mean, it truly is a content loop because I watch a lot of reality TV, which in itself has its own
[00:03:52.490] world of like content that people make. Oftentimes, I'll watch a show and I'll be like, holy shit,
[00:03:59.010] where's the tea? And then on TikTok or on Reddit or whatever, I'll consume a lot of like user
[00:04:04.350] generated content. But sometimes it's the other way around too. I'll see like a couple of clips floating
[00:04:09.490] around of like some show. And that's how I get sucked into that franchise or that TV show. And I'll
[00:04:14.550] start to watch it. I feel like if you're kind of intentionally going and being like, oh, I want
[00:04:19.350] to see what other users thought after they watched a TV show and looking that up, it's not as bad.
[00:04:25.170] But it's when there's like a constant cycle of content pushing you to watch more things and then
[00:04:30.470] that pushing you to watch more content. That's when it feels a little bit like, okay, should I be
[00:04:35.030] spending this much time looking this up?
[00:04:37.970] Yeah. And I wonder if part of it is I work from home. Back in the day, I say back in the day,
[00:04:43.210] like people used to work in the office where, you know, you'd watch like a show. Like I remember
[00:04:48.010] when I was younger, we would watch Lost with some of our family friends. And then when they go to
[00:04:52.530] work, they'd be like, it's like the water cooler talk. And you're like talking to your co-workers
[00:04:55.590] about it. And that's just like a conversation to talk about. But now we've kind of taken that away.
[00:05:00.050] Not saying everyone works from home, but now you've kind of sped that process up. Now you can go online
[00:05:04.630] and look it up to see what other people are saying. Or you can talk about it with your friends
[00:05:13.750] and it's easier to maybe find things that fit your specific niche or like your thoughts as well.
[00:05:21.410] Because it's like sometimes you go to work and you talk about something, you might not agree with
[00:05:24.970] that person. So it might not feel super satisfying or get rid of that itch in your head. But online,
[00:05:31.390] you can flip through like 40 different forum posts and find one. You're like, ah, yes, I'm so happy
[00:05:36.310] someone else thinks this too. So true. You like find your own little echo chamber in the corner of
[00:05:43.130] the internet. Exactly. So it sounds like the three of us are maybe a little bit more online
[00:05:50.130] than the average person. But what are some signs for you guys that you need to unplug?
[00:05:57.070] Yes, I think Crystal mentioned it before. It's kind of just maybe some of the aimless use of being
[00:06:03.310] online. So sometimes I'll just be on Reddit, clicking on the homepage and just looking for
[00:06:07.770] something to kind of like, catch my attention. It's like, am I really trying to look for a specific
[00:06:14.550] thing? Or like, what's my purpose for being online? And sometimes it's just, I'm bored. And I just want
[00:06:20.070] something to do. Same thing with shows. So if I'm going online, it's like, okay, if I know
[00:06:25.690] Arcanes just came out, then I can go watch that. But I can also just go on Netflix and just scroll
[00:06:31.590] through like all the different things of okay, let me find something to watch just because I'm bored
[00:06:36.590] and I have nothing better to do. In reality, maybe I do have something better to do. But my brain maybe
[00:06:41.950] is just tied to trying to find something in technology. Dude, so true. I feel like there's
[00:06:47.990] definitely been those muscle memory moments where like, I pull up my phone and my thumb just
[00:06:53.310] automatically leads me to like Reddit or like Instagram. And I'm like, wait, I literally just
[00:06:58.510] open this app. Why am I opening it again? Yep, same. Yeah, so those are definitely more constant than I
[00:07:05.910] would like to admit. These like muscle memory app openings. And sometimes it's almost muscle memory of
[00:07:13.430] bringing your phone out of your pocket in itself. And then you're like, wait, why did I even need my
[00:07:18.070] phone again? And then you like take it out again three seconds after you put it back into your pocket.
[00:07:23.630] Okay, I feel like mine is a little bit. It's a lot. But usually I like a dual screen setup. And if I'm
[00:07:31.010] sitting at my computer, it means that I have my main monitor and I'm like doing something on it,
[00:07:35.470] whether it's reading a forum or like playing a game or something. And then on my side screen,
[00:07:39.750] I'll have like a show or music or like something else going to stimulate me. If I'm not on my screen,
[00:07:45.710] I'll have my iPad running some sort of show and then I'll be like doing something on my phone,
[00:07:49.530] right? But I will say there are times where I need so much like technological stimulation that I bring
[00:07:56.790] out like the triple screen setup, where maybe I'll have something on the TV. And then I'm doing
[00:08:01.810] something on my computer or my iPad. And then that's not enough. So I'll like pull out my phone.
[00:08:06.790] As soon as that happens, I'm like, okay, this, this is too much. Take a step back.
[00:08:12.970] Wait, I have a question, though. When you do that, do you truly capture all three mediums,
[00:08:18.950] like you're able to fully capture all the content? Once the third one comes out, it's like too much.
[00:08:26.010] Like the third one usually means I'm playing a game on my phone, reading something on my computer
[00:08:30.110] and then watching something on the TV. So then I'm doing everything poorly. Everything's running
[00:08:35.090] at like 15% efficiency. But the dual screen, I feel like it's pretty good. Maybe it's like 70%
[00:08:41.050] consumption of each thing. I see. That's fair. I know it's a lot. But I don't know, maybe this need
[00:08:50.150] of wanting more, even more than the high stimulation that I'm already getting. I mean, a lot of people
[00:08:55.970] call this brain rot or like a segment of brain rot, I think. And I can also feel this on TikTok
[00:09:01.070] sometimes. The running joke is that there's subway surfers on the bottom and then some sort of other
[00:09:07.090] clip that you're watching on top. So yeah, I just feel like my attention span is getting more and
[00:09:13.390] more segmented down.
[00:09:15.130] Yeah, I would agree. And I think attention span is a good thing to point out is because I remember
[00:09:21.110] before like I could watch shows and get through kind of the slower parts without any issue. But
[00:09:26.390] sometimes now, when I'm watching a show, and there's a slow part, I'll just take out my phone
[00:09:31.210] and just like start, I don't know, I'll go on Instagram or go on Reddit or something. And I'm
[00:09:35.710] still paying attention to the show. But then I just get distracted. And then eventually it picks up.
[00:09:40.550] And then I have to go back in the show to catch up. But then it's like, I need to catch myself in
[00:09:44.870] those moments and just be like, this is part of the process. I need to just focus on the show.
[00:09:49.370] Because there's also a lot of times where I'll have a show on in the background that I actually care
[00:09:53.630] about the plot. I just miss it. And I'm like, I have no clue what I just watched for 30 minutes,
[00:09:58.230] I need to go back and watch it because I didn't actually take the time to pay attention to that.
[00:10:03.850] Just I'm trying to overstimulate myself probably, which probably just an attention span problem.
[00:10:09.930] I think it becomes more obvious for myself when I'm tired as well. If I'm trying to watch like a
[00:10:16.210] show or something, I'm pretty exhausted. And I pull out my phone suddenly to like, do other stuff.
[00:10:22.710] I'll catch myself like, Oh, wait, what am I doing? Now I don't know what is going on on either of
[00:10:27.910] these screens. So then I have to like, pause, rewind, put the phone away. But then it's like
[00:10:33.270] such a habit that sometimes later into the show or whatever, I'll pull my phone out again. I'm like,
[00:10:38.630] wait, I just went over this. Like I can't be doing this right now.
[00:10:41.750] It truly is muscle memory. And I feel like a lot of it too, is not just our bad habits as a consumer,
[00:10:49.730] but I feel like we're also being trained this way to a certain extent. Balmy, you mentioned
[00:10:54.510] Instagram. And I feel this very often with Instagram where I'll open it to see if there's
[00:10:59.570] any unseen stories. Because I don't like seeing the ring around it. And then I'll just like tap
[00:11:04.650] through everything really quick. And I'm just like, why am I even doing this? I feel like a monkey or
[00:11:08.670] something. Wait, do you watch every single story on your feed? If I'm not having like a super busy day,
[00:11:15.650] I'll out of habit just like click through everything. And I'm not even like truly watching it.
[00:11:19.490] Yeah, just trying to get that ring out there. I do the same thing. I don't know if I feel better
[00:11:25.450] or worse that I do the same thing. Oh my god, I used to do that back in the day when stories was
[00:11:33.280] still kind of new. And it felt like I could finish it. But now it feels like it's never ending.
[00:11:38.400] Don't people add new stories almost immediately after you finish?
[00:11:42.500] Yeah, I mean, maybe my following list is like a little bit more manageable where maybe the people
[00:11:48.060] I follow don't post as many stories. But yeah, if I have time, I will try to get through the pile of
[00:11:55.260] stories. That's the 100% completionist in you. Well, besides some signs that you need to unplug,
[00:12:04.020] are there any things that help you unplug in the moment? Whether that means you're unplugging one
[00:12:10.460] thing to focus on another plugged in thing. But I wonder if you have any measures that help you
[00:12:16.940] stay, I guess, more focused on one thing at a time.
[00:12:20.640] So probably like we talked about before, just kind of being conscious of why I'm trying to do
[00:12:27.760] what I'm doing. If I just like go on Reddit aimlessly, maybe that just means I should go for
[00:12:32.520] a walk or go like work out a little bit or go get some food or something, right? It gets some
[00:12:37.980] distraction because I've probably just been laying down and I'm just trying to find a distraction.
[00:12:43.840] Or it could be after work. So if I just had a really long workday, a lot of meetings,
[00:12:48.760] I've just been working from like nine to five straight. And my brain is kind of fried. Sometimes
[00:12:54.180] I'll just go on to my other monitor, which has my personal computer, and then I'll start trying to
[00:12:59.020] watch a show. But then it's like, is that really what I need right now? Or should I just kind of get a
[00:13:03.700] break? And then go do something else, spend time with the family and get some food, etc.
[00:13:09.340] I think for me, there's probably a couple of things that I do. One, I have to transition out
[00:13:14.660] of a certain part of the internet and then into like a more real life part of the internet.
[00:13:19.640] And what I mean by that is instead of watching reality TV or reading Reddit, I'll open up like
[00:13:25.120] a vlog or something. And I'll slowly transition into more of like the lifestyle part of YouTube.
[00:13:31.380] And YouTube is also a little bit more long form than TikTok. Sometimes I feel like it does help.
[00:13:36.380] But what really helps me honestly is like getting some fresh air. And I'm not someone who takes a lot
[00:13:42.540] of walks. So I'm either like at home or I'm outside, you know, but even just stepping out into
[00:13:48.580] like the backyard really quick and getting like a huge whiff of fresh air, I feel like resets me a
[00:13:54.020] little bit. I get less of a need to be chronically online. I think one thing that helps me is actually
[00:14:01.560] the do not disturb functions on our phones. I have it automatically set to go off at night.
[00:14:09.260] And I feel like that's a huge help because I don't know how we used to do it before.
[00:14:15.660] I'm pretty sure every time my phone vibrated in the middle of the night in the past, it would wake
[00:14:20.460] me up. There would be maybe like a 60 to 70% chance that it would wake me up. So now that I have
[00:14:26.680] do not disturb automatically set, I can like sleep through the night and not worry about notifications.
[00:14:33.200] And I have it set to a little later in the morning to one because I wake up later, but also because
[00:14:39.940] I think it protects my morning a bit better to when I wake up and I have to like get ready,
[00:14:45.940] eat breakfast and stuff. It reduces my screen time a bit as I prepare for my day.
[00:14:52.080] See, I feel like that wouldn't work on me because notifications aren't what makes me
[00:14:57.780] chronically online. You know what I mean? It's like I just habitually open TikTok. I habitually
[00:15:02.580] open whatever phone game I'm playing at the moment. And then that's what takes up the majority of my
[00:15:07.480] screen time. So I feel like I need to come up with a way to block my phone games or something.
[00:15:13.480] I think there's apps for that.
[00:15:15.320] Like limit your screen time or something.
[00:15:17.400] Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:18.480] What is it? Parental control yourself.
[00:15:20.440] Oh my God.
[00:15:22.540] But yeah, I do think it helps in certain moments. I think like if I go out and I watch a movie in
[00:15:28.800] theaters, I'll put my phone on do not disturb. It actually helps too for driving. Usually if you
[00:15:35.360] your phone connects by Bluetooth automatically to your car, it'll like automatically go into driving
[00:15:40.640] mode. And I do think it helps with like reducing the urge to respond to a text or something while
[00:15:47.960] you're driving. Yeah, that makes sense. Safety first. I will also say too, in the beginning of
[00:15:56.360] this episode, we talked about how unplugging or being online can mean very different things
[00:16:02.300] depending on what you're doing on your screens. So I'm curious if you guys feel like there are
[00:16:08.060] things you do on a screen that are way more productive and you wouldn't consider it as being
[00:16:13.440] chronically online and things you do that are really, really unproductive. Like you consider
[00:16:18.260] it basically rotting online.
[00:16:20.020] So it probably just goes back to like having a purpose for things. I work from home. So I guess
[00:16:24.740] all of that is technically productive, but maybe other things. So if there's like a new climbing
[00:16:30.960] video or something that I want to watch and I want to get something out of it because they're like
[00:16:35.700] showing a technique or they've collabed with an Olympian. And so I want to watch the Olympian
[00:16:41.260] climb because watching someone who's that good is just really cool and very inspiring. So I feel like
[00:16:46.060] that stuff is very good for me. I'm okay with it at least. Social media is a hard one because it's
[00:16:52.700] hard to ever really say like social media is really benefiting me, whether it's like my mental health
[00:16:58.960] or like good use of my time. But I guess there are still allowances for it that I give myself where
[00:17:05.460] I want to see what other people are doing. Or sometimes I will find like a funny meme that I
[00:17:11.180] can send to my friends. Or again, it's just like tied to something that's my hobby or on Instagram,
[00:17:18.220] I look up a lot of food stuff. So it's like I want to make that or that'd be really nice to make or get
[00:17:23.060] recipes from there. So those could be a little bit more productive watching shows. I watch pretty much
[00:17:28.940] all my shows in some sort of online or streaming platform. If I want to watch that content, then
[00:17:34.180] that's kind of the only avenue that I have. So those ones I'd say are things that I'm okay with.
[00:17:39.340] It's really just when it gets to the aimless searching for entertainment.
[00:17:44.160] Yeah, I think that's fair. Honestly, I'd probably agree with a lot of that. My time online is not
[00:17:49.600] always unproductive. Similar to what you said, Balmy, like having a purpose or like a goal
[00:17:55.880] makes spending your time feel more valuable, I guess, or intentional. Even if I'm playing games,
[00:18:04.760] I feel like I usually have a goal in mind, like, oh, I want to finish this or like improve in this.
[00:18:11.900] And I think that makes it feel productive. And this is kind of a silly one. But I play like all the New
[00:18:19.020] York Times games at night. I feel like that is very productive. That is like word exercises.
[00:18:25.820] It's like an enrichment activity. Yeah, exactly. I'm like, this is definitely productive and in no way
[00:18:33.360] wasting my time. See, that is so interesting to me because I feel like playing games feels really,
[00:18:41.220] really unproductive for me. Maybe it's the types of games that I choose to play or how I choose to
[00:18:46.020] play it. Like I feel like social gaming and using games as a way to like connect with friends
[00:18:52.480] is a more productive way. But for me, I'm like a big phone game person. I like to play very solitary
[00:18:59.700] games like Stardew Valley or even stuff like TFT. I tend to play by myself and enjoy it more that way.
[00:19:07.260] So sometimes when I'm stuck in that loop of playing games for a while, I'm like, this is pretty bad.
[00:19:13.300] This is not what I would consider productive consumption. Dude, but when you're playing games
[00:19:18.340] like TFT, aren't you kind of setting a goal like, oh, I need to improve so I can like reach a certain
[00:19:23.860] level? Yeah, but it's like, what is that goal achieving? For me, I feel like there's no real life
[00:19:30.480] gain except for maybe like, I don't know, kudos that you can get for being like, I'm gold or I'm
[00:19:36.060] whatever in TFT. So then it just feels like something that I'm chasing. The opportunity cost
[00:19:42.640] of the stuff that I'm not doing outweighs the gain that I'm about to get. So that's how I feel like
[00:19:48.420] it's unproductive. And maybe because also I'm not like a huge, this is the strategy that I'm going
[00:19:53.560] to try and see if this works. I'm kind of like, okay, let's brute force like 40 games and see where
[00:19:58.520] that gets us kind of a person. So in that sense too, it's also unproductive, right? Like I'm not
[00:20:03.820] necessarily honing my skills to an extent. I'm just kind of like brute forcing a bunch of different
[00:20:07.740] things that exist on the internet. That's fair. It's like there's always something that people
[00:20:13.800] call unproductive. So now it's gaming as gaming's become a lot more popular. But before you could
[00:20:19.460] say like watching TV is just the original brain rot or just doing hobbies, right? Your hobbies don't
[00:20:27.120] necessarily add value to your life in other people's perspectives. But to you, it's really
[00:20:31.900] important because something that brings you joy, or it's something that keeps you healthy, or it's
[00:20:35.920] just something that like takes your mind away from the stresses of the world. So for me, that's kind
[00:20:42.140] of where gaming fits in. It's just another kind of like art consumption. It's like a multiplayer game,
[00:20:46.720] then it can be a way for me to like play with friends. So like if Crystal says, hey, you guys want
[00:20:50.300] to play Valorant, and then I join, that's some time that I'm willing to spend because I don't talk to
[00:20:55.540] Crystal too much. But then we can like play a game and hang out virtually. Or if I'm playing a single
[00:21:00.480] player game, then it'll be something that I want to kind of experience whatever that art is that the
[00:21:07.940] creator created. And I want to enjoy that. So for me, it's similar to watching a movie or watching like
[00:21:13.320] a TV show.
[00:21:14.420] Yeah, and I feel like this just goes to show how personal and subjective these feelings are, for sure.
[00:21:20.740] I kind of am in the realm where I consider online shopping very productive, where I'm like, okay,
[00:21:26.180] I'm doing research in order to get this product, because I'm doing it online. I have all these
[00:21:30.980] different options and all these different forms of research that I could do. So to me, it feels like
[00:21:35.340] a research project in a sense. But a lot of people could consider that like a big waste of time,
[00:21:41.680] right? It's like you're just spending money, and then you're spending hours on top of spending money
[00:21:46.160] trying to like find what you want. So it truly is a very personal experience, I think.
[00:21:50.900] So is your thesis what you end up buying?
[00:21:53.240] Yeah, my thesis is like the sneakers that I want for fall. And then I'll spend like hours
[00:21:59.740] researching on like, what's going to go out of style. And by the time I choose to buy the sneakers,
[00:22:05.060] everything is already out of style. So it doesn't even really fucking matter.
[00:22:09.860] But I can totally see how that feels and can be productive as well. Because it kind of all goes
[00:22:17.540] back to what Balmeet said, where like, you have a purpose, you're like, I'm literally doing research
[00:22:23.240] what to buy. There's intent, and you're gaining a lot of information. I guess in a sense, it's yeah,
[00:22:30.160] like you said, it's a research project, you're doing reading, gaining knowledge and all of that.
[00:22:34.880] And honestly, it's kind of a skill to have to I think internet literacy is a skill at the end of
[00:22:40.840] the day. But I guess it's like how we choose to use it. If what we're doing brings value to our lives
[00:22:47.380] in its own way, or if we just end up on the couch scrolling TikTok. Okay, for me, scrolling TikTok
[00:22:53.400] is extremely unproductive. But sometimes I just can't stop.
[00:22:58.280] Well, okay, as a TikTok mega user or power user, whatever the phrase is, I have to say that there's
[00:23:07.160] so many different niches and sections in TikTok. So sometimes when I'm on like gift guide TikTok of
[00:23:12.980] like things you should get your friends for the holidays, I feel like that's kind of productive.
[00:23:18.500] Yes, a lot of it is probably like hidden ads, but it's like I needed to do this research anyway.
[00:23:24.160] So I'm like, okay, this is like good to know. And I'll like bookmark it or like cooking talk,
[00:23:28.220] I feel like is productive, or even like restaurant recommendation talk. So I feel like even within
[00:23:34.160] TikTok, there's like Yelp TikTok, and there's like YouTube TikTok. And so you know, depends on where
[00:23:40.420] your niche is. That's true. I tend to pick up TikTok when I need a good laugh or have nothing
[00:23:47.260] else really going on. But you're right, there are some times where I stumble upon a video,
[00:23:51.300] and I'm like, Oh, this was actually very informational. Save.
[00:23:57.400] I don't have TikTok. It's just something that I've decided to never download. But with that being said,
[00:24:04.160] Instagram and YouTube just kind of fills the void with Instagram reels and YouTube shorts. So
[00:24:08.520] I do the same thing. And sometimes you just get sucked into the algorithm. And it's like the
[00:24:13.680] algorithm wins. And just keep going. But sometimes yeah, you find the little wins in there, like
[00:24:19.560] something to send to. For me, sometimes the win is if I send someone something. It's like I found value
[00:24:26.040] in it because this was worth me sending versus I just looked through 50 reels and nothing was worth
[00:24:32.240] sending. So it's like, did I get anything out of it? Which even if I send someone something,
[00:24:36.340] did I really get anything out of it? I don't know. But it's like the little wins, I guess.
[00:24:41.100] Yeah, that's true. Some comments on TikTok that make me laugh. They're just like, I have no one to
[00:24:46.480] talk about this with. Oh, yeah. It's because like something is just so niche or like specific.
[00:24:52.520] They can only bond with the other fellow commenters. They're like none of my friends would
[00:24:57.680] understand. Whenever I come across those, I'm like, fuck.
[00:25:01.420] I'm like my people.
[00:25:04.640] I have a question and it's maybe slightly veering away from the unplugged topic. But do you ever feel
[00:25:09.700] like your social media algorithm? So in this case, it could be TikTok or it could be like Instagram
[00:25:15.900] reels where it's kind of veering towards maybe an algorithm that you don't necessarily want to go
[00:25:21.100] down that route. And then you try and manipulate it to bring it back to what your interests are,
[00:25:25.640] kind of what your purpose for your social media algorithm is.
[00:25:30.360] Yeah, honestly, this is very brainwad of me. But I think of my TikTok algorithm as like a child.
[00:25:36.820] Oh, my God.
[00:25:37.820] And I have to like, set it straight sometimes.
[00:25:43.440] And I'll do so by rewarding good content. Like if it's a video that I'm like, oh, yeah,
[00:25:49.160] I'm glad this is all my algorithm. I'll like watch it through. I'll like read the comments or
[00:25:52.600] whatever. And if it's a video that I know is going to be bad in the first like three seconds of
[00:25:57.180] watching it, I'll like quickly skip it. And then that seems to kind of help it. Sometimes when I do
[00:26:01.440] that, I'm like, bro, this is like literally some lines of code. Like I shouldn't be personalizing
[00:26:06.460] it and thinking of it as a child.
[00:26:09.800] Boy, that's so funny.
[00:26:12.620] That's why I was asking. Sometimes it just veers in a direction where it's like, I don't want to go
[00:26:16.760] this route. Or it's like, it doesn't serve my purpose anymore. After coming back from Korea,
[00:26:21.660] like I was flooded with Korea content. And some of it has stuck around. So like,
[00:26:26.180] there's like some K-pop stuff that would never showed up in my algorithm that now has like stuck
[00:26:30.040] around a little bit or like food recommendations in Korea, which is great. But I'm not going to
[00:26:34.520] Korea again for a long time. So I don't need those. I want food recommendations for like LA.
[00:26:39.420] Right, right. I think there's definitely been moments where I'm like, okay, what the hell is this
[00:26:43.820] for you, Paige? What's going on here? Or like seeing the exact same stuff over and over
[00:26:49.160] gets like really tiring. Like I always get ads for collagen on my phone. And I'm like, dude,
[00:26:54.500] I already take collagen. I already bought collagen. Give me some new stuff. But I guess what's kind
[00:27:00.020] of interesting is sometimes if I feel like the algorithm isn't serving my purpose anymore,
[00:27:04.960] I just like stop. So there's definitely moments in time where I don't touch TikTok for,
[00:27:11.360] I don't know, weeks or so because I'm just like, yeah, whatever. My for you page sucks right now
[00:27:15.860] anyways. And I guess in my mind, I'm thinking maybe it'll reset itself sort of because I actually
[00:27:22.100] don't ever like videos. I only like maybe watch them through and read comments, occasionally save
[00:27:29.480] stuff. Even if I accidentally like a video, I always unlike it. This is kind of an interesting
[00:27:34.320] question too, because James and I are both TikTok users, but we have very different algorithms.
[00:27:40.340] So I will say like James has a lot of tech product content on his TikTok and then also like a lot of
[00:27:46.440] sports highlights. And then for me, I have a lot of like humor stuff and then bits and pieces of each
[00:27:52.140] of my hobbies like K-pop, reality TV, shopping, whatever. But for the most part, it's like funny
[00:27:57.580] content. So when we do our TikTok review at the end of the night, we always use my phone because mine has
[00:28:03.840] all the funnies, right? But sometimes I will have consumed too much gift guide content or whatever,
[00:28:09.560] or like shopping or like restaurant. And that will supersede the funnies. And then he'll be like,
[00:28:15.900] Ooh, you're like, what's wrong with your algorithm today? And I feel like I'm getting like my test
[00:28:20.600] graded or something, or like someone's reading my journal. And I'm like, Oh, like, sorry. I don't
[00:28:24.880] know why it's like this. Like, it should be more funny today. Like, I'm so sorry. Then later,
[00:28:29.000] I'm just like, wait, wait, you should next time you should be like, wait, how about you pull out your
[00:28:34.660] TikTok algorithm? Well, sometimes we do. And then I'm like, I can't watch 20 NBA highlights videos in
[00:28:41.640] a row. Yeah. You'd be like, Oh, what's wrong with your algorithm today? Wait, that's so funny. You do
[00:28:47.980] a TikTok review at the end of the day. Yeah. You know, actually, speaking of all this, going back to
[00:28:55.000] what Balmite said, finding something that is sendable to a friend is very satisfying. And I was thinking
[00:29:01.900] about it as we've been talking about this all, the more I think about it, the more true it is.
[00:29:07.200] I think every time I bump into something where I'm like, Oh my God, someone could relate with me over
[00:29:11.880] this. It's a huge win. I'm like, nice. I'm normal. This is relatable content. I also think that the
[00:29:20.660] process of finding something sendable is also very different per person. And I realized this through
[00:29:26.960] the many years of me and James sending each other content. If I see something that's 1% relevant to
[00:29:32.600] James, I'll send it to him. And I'm like, haha, like this reminded me of you. But then I realized that
[00:29:38.040] he doesn't do that with me. Like he kind of like curates it way more. It's like, Oh, well, Jisoo
[00:29:43.660] laugh at this. And I feel like that's his criteria. And it completely changed the way that I see content
[00:29:49.140] too. I'm like, maybe I shouldn't just be like, Oh, this reminded me of you and send it like maybe I
[00:29:53.460] should be like this TikTok is perfectly created for you and send that instead. Like have a higher
[00:29:58.660] like barrier of entry, I guess. Dude, I'm definitely on the towards James's thought process.
[00:30:04.820] Whenever I share stuff, sometimes I'll share stuff with like Balmy and the other guys that we play
[00:30:10.380] games with. And it'll be like very specific Valorant content or like something that we do together.
[00:30:16.780] And then yeah, for you, it's also similar. Like, will Jisoo laugh at this? Or like, did we talk about
[00:30:22.200] this recently? Like that kind of stuff. I also think it depends on who the person is,
[00:30:26.900] because I'm also on that more curated side. But like certain people, I might just be like,
[00:30:32.180] Oh, will they judge me for sending them this? Because it didn't hit like the bar of what
[00:30:37.040] ascendable like real is or meme is. So there's also that it's just the acceptance of the person.
[00:30:43.860] Will they like judge me for sending them low quality content?
[00:30:48.360] Also, I think it's fair to send someone like your significant other, just like way more content,
[00:30:54.900] because they probably are on a different level of understanding with you than just any other
[00:31:01.320] random friend. So then sometimes when I'm thinking about, you know, specific friends to send stuff to,
[00:31:07.200] this can't have been a waste of their time. They can't just open it and be like, I don't get it.
[00:31:12.780] But like, if I sent something really random to my boyfriend, and he was like, I don't get it. It's
[00:31:17.820] like, fine, I can explain it to him. Or I can be like, what the fuck? And then judge him for it in a
[00:31:23.520] judge free zone.
[00:31:25.880] Yeah, that's very true. Although I will say sometimes we'll have our TikTok review sessions.
[00:31:32.120] You know, when you're scrolling TikTok by yourself, or at least for me, I feel like I'm more likely to
[00:31:36.560] watch a video that's longer. So like, even if it's like a five minute video on TikTok, which typically only
[00:31:41.800] has like, I don't know, one to two minute long videos, also watch it because I'm just by myself,
[00:31:46.540] right? I feel like when you're watching as a pair, it's like so strange to go from like little snippet
[00:31:52.800] videos and then watching like a full on like five minute video. So sometimes we'll skip those even
[00:31:58.620] though we like sent it to each other and be like, okay, whoever didn't watch it, just watch it on
[00:32:02.300] your own time. And when that happens, I'm like, dude, this is such a strange experience. You know,
[00:32:08.080] I feel like families and couples went from watching TV shows or like movies together. And then now I
[00:32:14.500] just my attention span is like, this is five minutes long. Like I can't watch it right now.
[00:32:18.620] Oh my god.
[00:32:19.780] Wow, it's like homework. You're like, watch this on your own time.
[00:32:23.060] Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:23.960] We'll come back to discuss.
[00:32:26.420] From book club to TikTok club.
[00:32:29.000] Yeah.
[00:32:29.240] So it seems that in our conversation of unplugging, we've accidentally plugged ourselves in.
[00:32:36.980] Just a little bit.
[00:32:38.300] What is like the hardest part of unplugging to bring us back?
[00:32:42.740] So I actually feel like the hardest part of unplugging is really just missing that stimulation
[00:32:48.440] aspect. And if it's like a weekend where I have a lot of social plans, I feel like I don't have an
[00:32:56.760] urge to like really be plugged in because I'm like, oh my god, it's so much fun. I'm like chatting
[00:33:00.680] with all my friends. We might be out doing stuff or just, you know, enjoying some time together.
[00:33:05.600] I don't even get the urge. But if it's a weekend where I'm like by myself for the entire weekend,
[00:33:11.880] don't have any social plans, I like need all my screens. And I've tried to I've been trying to
[00:33:18.280] kind of like wean off it a little bit because my addiction is really bad. I would say
[00:33:22.560] I try to consume more of the lifestyle content that I was talking about. So I'll put on a video
[00:33:27.240] of someone journaling and then I will also journal with them. So it's like body doubling. And to me,
[00:33:31.460] that's sort of protective. But still, it's like a form of being plugged in. So yeah, I don't know.
[00:33:38.140] I think I just need 40 different audio streams going on in my head at once always.
[00:33:43.860] Yeah, I guess it's just finding something to fill the void. If you're busy doing something,
[00:33:48.200] whether it's a hobby or spending time with friends or spending time with family, especially just traveling
[00:33:53.220] or getting away, that's probably the easiest way to to unplug. But it's not exactly the cheapest way
[00:33:59.240] to unplug. Yeah, I think it's just trying to fill the void. And for me, if I'm at the climbing gym,
[00:34:04.660] then it's easy for me to just not even do anything on my phone for two to three hours. If I'm alone,
[00:34:10.140] then it's a little bit harder because I need some time to rest. So I might just go on my phone to
[00:34:14.220] force myself to take the time to rest. But if I'm with friends, then it's that time goes by very
[00:34:19.320] quickly. And I don't sometimes I just don't even look at my phone for a few hours.
[00:34:23.260] I think for me, there's also an aspect of FOMO, I guess you feel like you're missing out on content or
[00:34:31.160] updates within whatever community you follow or something. There's like some really niche examples.
[00:34:38.780] Sometimes there's TikTok drama and people are like posting about their slow updates. But then
[00:34:44.140] if you are unplugged for a while, you can totally miss it. And then you're like, oh, shit, like what
[00:34:49.400] happened? I totally missed this whole saga. I think another example could be like if you didn't
[00:34:54.500] maybe watch a really popular TV show when it first came out, you miss out on that initial wave of
[00:35:01.760] extra content and like conversation. And then you feel like you're playing catch up. Maybe you missed
[00:35:08.040] the initial excitement. So now it's like just you. You don't get like that whole extra group
[00:35:14.140] I guess feeling or community feeling almost. So I think those are some aspects that make it hard to
[00:35:20.660] unplug for me. It's interesting because I think that part has gotten better because of technology.
[00:35:26.740] Because for the water cooler talk stuff, if you didn't watch the episode from the previous night,
[00:35:32.460] then if you join in that conversation, one, you might not have anything to say, but then two,
[00:35:36.840] you might get spoilers versus me. I was busy the weekend that Arcane finished. And so I ended up
[00:35:43.660] watching it. I think it was Monday. I had to purposely avoid all content for Arcane so that I
[00:35:49.740] wouldn't get spoiled about the end of it. But when I finished it, then I was able to go back and either
[00:35:54.640] follow up on like the comments and friend group to talk about it or just go on Reddit and then read the
[00:36:00.080] discussion. But I'm also not a someone who's going to post on Reddit. I'm more of a lurker in that regard.
[00:36:05.620] That's actually a good point. I do avoid social media when I'm behind on a show, especially if
[00:36:12.980] it's a huge thing. You know, back in the day when it was like Game of Thrones, lately Arcane, I was
[00:36:17.820] like, I just can't open anything like Reddit or Twitter just in case I accidentally get spoiled
[00:36:23.800] on something because I know there's a lot of people I follow or my algorithm is tuned into this.
[00:36:29.900] So I guess that's like something that helps you stay a little more unplugged, procrastinating.
[00:36:37.280] It's like you're unplugging so that you could plug in at maximum satisfaction rate later.
[00:36:43.620] Seriously.
[00:36:45.300] Which is not a bad thing because then you're really making a good use out of whatever
[00:36:49.280] you want to spend your time on. Again, you're not aimlessly searching for something or to your
[00:36:56.240] point, Jisoo, just like getting that 50% satisfaction hit. You want to you want to make sure you get the
[00:37:01.680] most out of it.
[00:37:02.500] That's true. Yeah.
[00:37:04.300] I will say I feel like it's hard for me to visualize what unplugging looks like in the modern
[00:37:09.040] day because it's really not just a phone thing. It's like a computer thing, too. And now I feel
[00:37:16.340] like most of us have work computers that are just like absolute necessities to even be employed,
[00:37:23.280] essentially. I don't know. Like what does unplugging look like now?
[00:37:27.960] A weekend or like PTO. Wait, actually, this is really funny because I just came back from a trip
[00:37:37.020] to China. Everyone knows how China has a lot of Western sites blocked. So I did feel like a little
[00:37:43.560] bit in China. I was like unplugged. Like sometimes this content was just not reachable from where I was.
[00:37:52.240] And so I was like missing out. But then at the same time, it forced me to be a little more in
[00:37:58.580] tune with like what was happening around me, hanging out with the family that I was there for
[00:38:02.660] and exploring a little more versus just like sitting at home and being on my phone and being like,
[00:38:08.740] 10 more minutes or something.
[00:38:11.300] Which is interesting, too, because, yeah, it's filling the void with things that in reality probably do
[00:38:16.760] matter a little bit more to yourself because you're just you really are making a choice of saying,
[00:38:21.160] oh, I want to spend time with family. I want to be in the world around me instead of
[00:38:25.840] distracting myself with something on my phone or with technology. But I think times like that are also
[00:38:32.180] really important because then you can self-reflect on the stuff that you were missing out on.
[00:38:36.460] Like, do they really bring you value in your life? Like, do you really value those where when you go
[00:38:40.700] back, you might not have like that addiction to say, oh, I need to do this. It's like, do I really
[00:38:45.940] want to do this? Is this something that I like value and want to keep in my plugged in life?
[00:38:52.760] Okay, I have a question about unplugging. Do you think doing something that's like audio only
[00:38:59.200] counts as unplugging? Or do you think audio and visual counts for being plugged in?
[00:39:06.480] I think if you were just listening to music or something, I wouldn't consider that being plugged
[00:39:11.720] in. Yeah, the bar is probably different. I've never thought about this. It's music I don't
[00:39:17.860] consider as being plugged in as just kind of a extension of your life, like background music,
[00:39:23.100] I guess. Podcasts too, because I feel like my podcasts are very purposeful. So I'll listen to
[00:39:28.700] Earcrust sometimes. Not always. Sorry, but especially like if the topic resonates with me,
[00:39:35.320] or I know that it'll resonate with me and I'll really enjoy it. I listen to like sports podcasts,
[00:39:40.180] but like very specific ones for personalities that I like. And I'll listen to political podcasts. Like
[00:39:44.220] that's kind of the extent of my podcast listening. And those are just sources of information where I
[00:39:50.560] choose to get the information from there versus other mediums. But for me, it's also like I only
[00:39:56.620] listen to podcasts when I drive. And since I don't go to work as much anymore, my podcast usage is also
[00:40:01.380] reduced a lot. So I think the bar is definitely a little bit different there. Maybe audio at home
[00:40:07.220] just doesn't stimulate me enough to like capture my attention.
[00:40:12.340] I don't know. I guess I would consider podcasts as being plugged in. Audiobooks too, a little bit.
[00:40:18.340] Because it's not just like noise anymore. I mean, not saying music is just noise, but
[00:40:24.120] I'm not like dissecting every word. Right, right. So it feels less like content. But I feel like
[00:40:29.520] podcasts and audiobooks do feel like content to me. And that's the hardest thing. I feel like a big
[00:40:34.800] part of unplugging that's difficult for me is if I truly didn't have anything, but like,
[00:40:39.840] let's say I didn't even have music running on in the background or something. That silence,
[00:40:44.520] I feel like is a little bit hard for me to just like sit in. Yeah, that's just a little bit tough
[00:40:50.100] for unplugging. That's fair. I think personally, I'm actually very bad at multitasking. Maybe that
[00:40:56.800] helps a bit because then it reduces the possibility of overloading myself with things. But I still do end
[00:41:02.600] up maybe watching a show while also just mindlessly browsing my phone. But I think it does help
[00:41:09.000] sometimes when I'm like, oh, I should focus on this show because this is the kind of show where
[00:41:13.760] you have to pay a bit of attention to. And then it's a little easier to like pull myself away from
[00:41:19.320] one of the extra screens to focus on like one main screen.
[00:41:23.320] When do you guys feel like this kind of started in terms of the forced overstimulation? So when I was in
[00:41:31.820] college, I had to have music on while I was studying or like a show on in the background,
[00:41:36.800] which sounds counterproductive, but I just needed like something in the background for that.
[00:41:42.380] And then even when I was working, at least in my previous role, when I had a little bit more time
[00:41:46.720] with less meetings, then I would have like a show on or like some music on in the background all
[00:41:51.520] working. And while my focus was work, it's just having something in the background. And then now
[00:41:55.780] I don't have as much time. So I can't really do that. But like, when do you think that started for
[00:42:00.840] you guys? And do you even remember, I guess, the time before that and like how that felt just kind of
[00:42:05.660] being maybe it's like, okay, with just being by yourself doing whatever you're doing?
[00:42:12.280] So if I remember correctly, I got my first personal laptop in like elementary school.
[00:42:18.240] So then I feel like that propelled me into being like a full blown laptop kid, which I almost feel
[00:42:26.820] like is worse than being an iPad kid to a certain extent, because you can really only have so many
[00:42:31.660] apps on at once. And I guess the iPad mode has changed now that you could do like the screen and
[00:42:36.300] screen thing or like a picture in picture thing and have like a video streaming. But having a laptop
[00:42:41.060] back then at a very early age kind of just made me very comfortable using technology. So I think that's
[00:42:46.760] why I'm so like brain rot now. But I will say the second stage of my brain rot journey happened
[00:42:53.660] with TikTok in 2019. Like I remember it so vividly, just how like shocking the short form content was,
[00:43:01.940] and how digestible it was. And it just like sucked me in. And this was pre COVID era too. And I was
[00:43:08.800] like, Oh my god, everyone needs to download it. And back then everyone was like, dude, why are you on
[00:43:12.760] fucking musically like that app is for kids? Little did they know? Yeah, little did they know it will
[00:43:20.240] take over the world in just a short couple of years. I think similar to Jisoo, when I was pretty young,
[00:43:26.340] I started to multitask on the internet. And I think one of the biggest things was us having like, aim
[00:43:35.280] chat messaging apps, then I would be maybe doing homework. But then the moment you hear like a little
[00:43:42.640] ping from the chat messaging app, you jump to it and you try to like respond and have conversation.
[00:43:48.800] And I think that like started to leak into everything a little bit. Even if I was just
[00:43:55.120] doing something for fun, like maybe I was watching a show, maybe I was like watching a movie. When
[00:43:59.720] someone chats you, immediately your attention is drawn and you start multitasking. You know, now that
[00:44:05.840] I'm really reflecting, I'm also realizing that when I watched YouTube, I read the comments a lot. So I
[00:44:12.160] actually also end up watching while simultaneously reading the comments. Even if I'm watching YouTube on
[00:44:18.700] like my TV, I'll pull up the comments. And then you know how it's like, kind of on the side, you can do
[00:44:24.100] both. So I'm like, Oh shit, actually, I do definitely multitask a lot, even if it's using just one screen.
[00:44:30.840] So I think like these kinds of things help feel the whole being glued to the screen kind of thing.
[00:44:37.000] When I finally caved and downloaded TikTok, I was like, okay, I see now I can see why everyone's
[00:44:44.320] like so obsessed. And I understand the like pull of the short form content and how easy it is to just
[00:44:50.660] scroll away your time. So for sure, all of that, I could feel my attention span dropping from it.
[00:44:57.720] So I do want to circle back on like unplugging specifically. We talk a lot about wanting to
[00:45:03.480] unplug or like times that we can unplug. But what do you think really are the benefits of
[00:45:08.460] unplugging for you personally? I think one of the biggest benefits of unplugging is almost like
[00:45:15.220] forcing yourself to be productive in real life. I think sometimes when I sit on the couch and rot,
[00:45:22.800] it's forcing me to procrastinate on like real life responsibilities, whether that's just like small
[00:45:28.700] errands, maybe like grocery shopping or like cleaning the house or something of that sort. So I think it does
[00:45:35.300] reduce that procrastination a bit. And then it ultimately leads to a bit of a better organized
[00:45:44.040] day almost where maybe you are able to finish all your errands. And then at the end of the day,
[00:45:50.460] you have free time and you're like, okay, I can guilt free plug in and, you know, waste some time.
[00:45:56.180] So I do think that's like a huge benefit, just like helping you get your shit done earlier.
[00:46:01.220] Yeah, I would agree. Because it's like a tier list of why I do the things that I do. So the things that
[00:46:06.700] I really want to do, like I'll get done, that has a higher priority over the brain rot activities.
[00:46:12.120] If I don't want to do something, sometimes it's just easy to like pull out my phone,
[00:46:15.980] go on Instagram, start doom scrolling on reels or looking to see what's the latest posts on Reddit
[00:46:22.780] and the subreddit that I follow. It's kind of putting my phone down or stepping away from the
[00:46:27.820] computer and actually going to do the things that I need to do, whether that's my actual work or errands
[00:46:34.160] or just things that I've procrastinated on. So it's really just taking away the distractions.
[00:46:39.800] The other thing would be and kind of going back to the what we were talking about, like signs that
[00:46:45.540] you need to unplug, because sometimes it's good to unplug even when you're not really having those
[00:46:49.700] negative effects. But when you have those negative effects, where sometimes I'll just be online
[00:46:54.260] and I just feel like shit, and I just keep going. And then it just kind of continues,
[00:46:58.400] where it's kind of like taking yourself and like breaking away from that. So I think there's also
[00:47:02.980] like a big mental health benefit of really doing things that are good for you, again, and not
[00:47:09.840] procrastinating. Yeah, I think I agree with both of you. For me personally, I feel like there's a big
[00:47:16.760] sense of derealization that happens if I sit online too long. It kind of makes me live my life,
[00:47:24.260] as like a content consumer and not like a real person. So once I start to like really feel that
[00:47:30.180] derealization, and I'm like, holy shit, I'm like not a real person right now. Unplugging helps me reset
[00:47:35.460] that. And then I can consume the real world as content instead of digitally. I think the other
[00:47:41.780] benefit to of unplugging is it helps to like reset the pace of life again, especially when you're very
[00:47:47.960] used to like short form content. I feel like you're used to life being in that sense to stepping away
[00:47:53.860] from the screen for a little bit or maybe like logging out of TikTok for a little bit also helps
[00:47:58.060] to kind of reset back to where normal life pace is. That makes sense. I think another one is just like
[00:48:05.300] it's good to remind yourself to unplug every now and then because you don't want to be like the iPad
[00:48:11.100] kid at the dinner table. I think it's like easy to get sucked in and then not even realize you're
[00:48:18.140] scrolling your phone when you're having a dinner with friends and then miss out on that dinner
[00:48:23.520] essentially because you're somewhere else in the internet world. So sometimes seeing that happen
[00:48:29.740] in real life is a good wake up call or reminder like, oh, we had dinner with friends and like half
[00:48:36.400] of us were just on our phones and like did we really have dinner together? Well, despite all of our
[00:48:43.960] mild to extreme connection to the internet, do you think you've been working towards slash achieving a
[00:48:52.780] healthier balance in your life with technology? I want to say yes. Just kind of realizing the things
[00:49:00.940] that I prioritize over the like, as we talked about the brain rot activities, I want to make a better use
[00:49:07.620] of my time. I guess I'm like training myself to be okay with those lulls. And I think those are the
[00:49:14.740] hardest times. It's like lull in conversation at like a dinner table or lull during a TV show when I pull
[00:49:21.280] out my phone, getting rid of those things so I can really just kind of be present for whatever I'm
[00:49:26.540] trying to do. The healthy balance of getting what I need to get done and not letting myself get
[00:49:32.560] distracted because sometimes it's okay to get distracted and just let loose and just de-stress.
[00:49:37.620] But I think just not being consumed by it, that's where the healthy balance really comes into play.
[00:49:42.940] Yeah, for sure. You don't necessarily have to just like completely unplug and like cut it off cold
[00:49:48.920] turkey and like never touch a phone or internet again. I think it's like totally okay to allow
[00:49:56.020] yourself to have that time to like have brain rot. But as long as it's not affecting the rest of your
[00:50:03.260] life to the point where it's negative and you're not being as productive or losing yourself into the
[00:50:10.940] depths of the internet. So I think, yes, it's a constant battle, but it's something that's top of
[00:50:18.380] mind more often. I do like how our phones tell us our screen times now. So I actually pin that to my
[00:50:25.280] home screen so I can get a quick glance and it's kind of a friendly little reminder every time I look at my
[00:50:31.640] phone. Yeah, I feel like this is going to be one of those things that continues to be a work in
[00:50:36.760] progress for me. I actually very much enjoy being chronically online and I don't necessarily think
[00:50:42.000] of it as like a personal pitfall yet. But I do feel like there are opportunities to build out healthy
[00:50:48.360] habits during times where I don't necessarily need screen time, especially with bedtime hygiene and
[00:50:55.180] going to bed without my phone or like waking up and getting ready without having something playing in
[00:51:00.660] the background. Like those are things that I do try to work on. Fingers crossed there. But I will say,
[00:51:06.680] I feel like there's going to be a long journey ahead of us just with how technology evolves too.
[00:51:11.420] So we'll all be in it together.
