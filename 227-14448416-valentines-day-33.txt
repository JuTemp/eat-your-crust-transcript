[00:00:00.000] Hi, welcome back to Eat Your Crust podcast. I'm Crystal. I'm Jeesoo. I'm Daniel. Welcome, Daniel. Last time we had you on was back in episode 120, Gym Rats and Gym Noobs, where we talked about all things gyming. Sad to say that I personally have not
[00:00:28.880] furthered my gym journey. That's quite unfortunate. But I am more active than when we recorded that episode. Ah, it's nice. So before we get to the topic at hand, I have a word to share this week, and my
[00:00:44.160] word is tweaking. I actually don't have like a full proper definition for tweaking, but essentially it's someone is acting out maybe or like not calm. They're like freaking out is the basic explanation that I can think of. So I've seen it used like, oh, this person's tweaking, don't
[00:01:05.760] listen to them, or like someone get them help or whatever. So that's kind of the usage that I've seen tweaking. But I've seen it like all over TikTok. And I feel like Gen Z loves to use this word.
[00:01:16.320] Huh, I feel like I've only ever seen it in like the drug context, which is probably the more like literal usage of the word. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. But I know like on Reddit, especially
[00:01:26.960] there's like a subreddit called r slash took too much where it has videos of people who are like really, really hopped up on drugs. And all the comments are always like, oh, like he's tweaking
[00:01:36.160] off of whatever. That's what I thought of to like actual drug tweakers. Okay, so I just found it on know your meme, but the entry is not he tweaking. And it's from Lil Nas X. Oh, so there was a post
[00:01:51.920] on Instagram that said Tony Hawk is selling skateboards infused with his blood for $500 each. And then Lil Nas X commented on that post. He was like, nah, he tweaking. So I guess in this
[00:02:05.600] context, tweaking is basically mean like, what is this crazy behavior? So I guess it can tie back to like drugs. It's like, dude, is this guy on something like what is this? Yeah, blood infused
[00:02:16.720] skateboards is kind of wild. Damn, actually, nah, he tweaking is pretty iconic. Like I understand why it's a catchphrase now. Yeah, so I see a lot of Oh, this dude's tweaking or like, what is this?
[00:02:29.760] Like, yeah, basically calling out kind of outrageous behavior. Do you feel like you see it anywhere else other than I guess drug related stuff? I guess now that we have talked about this a little bit,
[00:02:40.480] I do think I see people use tweaking in like a bigger context. So like if there's some weird video or something, where someone has like a bad take, I think I have seen comments of like, oh,
[00:02:51.040] this guy's tweaking or whatever. I just never made the connection. Like I think I kind of subconsciously thought they were always talking about drugs. Yeah, it feels synonymous with like tripping, I guess. Like no, it's guys tripping or like he doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:03:04.480] Yeah, it says nice tweaking. Well, I guess this is going to be a new Gen Z word added to my personal arsenal. But tweaking aside, let's go into the topic we have at hand today, which is Valentine's
[00:03:19.280] Day. So Valentine's Day is coming up. And actually, this episode is a week before Valentine's Day. But we thought that we would push it out a little bit early, give everyone some time to think about
[00:03:30.160] the holiday before the actual holiday comes upon us. I was surprised when we looked at our past catalog of episodes and we're like, we've never talked about Valentine's Day before. So we thought it would be fun to bring our good friend Daniel on to talk about Valentine's Day
[00:03:44.960] and how we view it and how it's played a role in our lives through our different ages and eras. So I guess like the first thing that comes to mind for Valentine's Day is what did you do in your
[00:03:58.560] childhood for Valentine's Day? Did you bring Valentine's to school and like candy and celebrate it in the classroom? Or was it kind of not a big deal? Yeah, for me personally, I don't think it
[00:04:10.320] was a big part of my life growing up as a kid. I don't remember doing too many things for Valentine's Day. I never brought candy to like school, or even now to work. I feel like it's
[00:04:21.360] definitely more of a personal holiday to me where you would celebrate it with like your significant other nothing like in public, I guess like it's not really like a community holiday. Yeah.
[00:04:32.320] I also didn't bring Valentine's candy to school. And I feel like a big part of that is when you're seven years old, you're not the one going to Safeway and picking up like a bag of candy, right?
[00:04:42.000] I feel like it's always the parents who do it. And I don't think in Korea, they have this sort of culture. So my mom didn't even think to kind of include it in her shopping list or whatnot. But I
[00:04:53.200] do distinctly remember, there would be kids in the class that would bring candy to school. And it would be really cute because they would write like, oh, two and then write each person's
[00:05:01.920] name and then from and then their own name. And I would always be like, wow, this person is so caring or like, I don't know. I feel like it did change my perspective on them. Or at least their
[00:05:12.880] mom, I guess. Actually, now that you mention it, there might have been like in elementary school, like the teachers would have you make cards and like trade with people. I think there'd be those
[00:05:23.760] like little heart shaped candies. I don't know they would say like, be mine or something. Yeah. Like conversation hearts. Yeah, yeah. Like those. So I do remember doing that. But I never like personally went and got these. I think it was just like a school or classroom thing.
[00:05:38.560] Yeah, I think in elementary school, it was kind of a bigger deal since we had a homeroom. So we had a decent amount of people bring valentines or candy to share with the class. But yeah,
[00:05:51.680] as you said, it's like, you know, thanks to their parents. But I think as we got older, so you know, once we were getting closer to the end of elementary school, like fourth, fifth, sixth grade,
[00:06:03.440] then the candy is like tapering off. And by junior high, high school, I think it was very rare to hand out valentines. But I think that I did still see it very occasionally, someone would
[00:06:16.640] maybe just get some candy and give it to their close friends. Yeah, I find the whole like elementary school valentine's culture very fascinating. Because a lot of it, I think does show each
[00:06:29.040] person's personality a little bit like I remember the guys would always get cars themed or like Spider Man themed valentines. And then the girls would get like Powerpuff Girls or like something more feminine. And I remember even the types of candy that were included in the valentine very
[00:06:44.560] too. So I remember some of them, it was literally just a card and I'd be like, boo. And then some of them would be like a Tootsie Roll or like a low tier candy. And I would also be like,
[00:06:53.520] Hmm, okay. And then the really good ones were like nerds or like little Sour Patch or something. And I was like, these are the winners. These are like the A grade S tier valentines. I might have been the guy giving the cards.
[00:07:08.400] Actually, I think I was the same. I think I did cards only. It's okay. If it makes you feel better. I did not give anything out. So I was just judging by myself.
[00:07:20.320] But I'm trying to think about how the valentine's culture worked in high school. Because like you said, Crystal, I don't think people really passed out valentines. But our school did serenades. So you could actually pay like $15 or something to our schools choirs. And then they would kind of
[00:07:38.800] assemble little groups and go around during classrooms burst through the doors on Valentine's Day, put the girl or the guy on a chair and surround them and do a dance and song. And I
[00:07:48.320] remember that was always very much like what Valentine's Day was. I totally forgot about that. But yes, I was actually in choir doing that. Was it popular? Yeah, we would spend like the entire day doing it. And like people would get them for teachers
[00:08:05.200] and stuff too. So I remember, like they would split it into like boys groups serenading girls. I remember doing one for like our principal actually. Oh my god. Which is really random. We're doing all these like weird, weird choreographed dances where like it's like
[00:08:20.400] slightly suggestive, which is weird when it's the principal. Wait, so for these choir serenades, would they get to choose the song that you would sing for the person? Or did you just choose? Oh no, we chose the song and then we would do the
[00:08:36.480] choreograph and then we would do the same one for everyone. Oh, okay. So a lot easier. Yeah, makes sense. No special requests. Imagine you guys like trying to practice. You're like grinding the songs. You're like, holy shit, we need to learn these hundred songs by like next week.
[00:08:55.840] I think my school also did something similar. We had various clubs do different Valentine grams essentially. So acapella group did singing. And then I think there were various service clubs that would do like, I don't know, like an origami rose or like paper cranes, something simple like
[00:09:15.280] that, which I thought was like kind of nice because sometimes you would go to your classroom and then like see the gram or whatever on your desk and be like, oh, like that's, that's nice.
[00:09:23.920] And there were occasional mysterious ones like, oh, from your secret admirer. And then people be like, Oh, I wonder who that is. And then they forget the next day. It's kind of interesting.
[00:09:34.720] I feel like even back in high school, it seems like Valentine's Day was kind of still like a commercialized version of a holiday. Because all these things are things that you pay for so that
[00:09:44.880] someone can know that they're loved. But it's like through the vessel of money and other people doing the work for you. Wow, that's a good point. Not to, you know, be all cynical. Yeah, I guess Valentine's Day is pretty commercialized. Even now, what do you do
[00:10:01.760] for Valentine's Day? One of the like easiest things to do is have a date and you know, go out and have dinner and that's spending money. So what if this whole thing was created just to
[00:10:13.200] stimulate the economy? Dude, a true Hallmark holiday. We need to find the origins of Valentine's Day. There's some secret propaganda thing. Yeah, I guess if I think about the way that I've been celebrating Valentine's Day recently, it truly is very much focused on like a dinner date. So
[00:10:34.080] I think it's almost 5050 in between dinner dates at home and dinner dates outside. I feel like dinner dates outside kind of tend to be some sort of fine dining meal or like a nice meal where we
[00:10:45.440] both dress up and go on a date. But dinner dates inside I feel like always have a specific pattern. And it's always been James makes steak and some sort of like vegetable side and we have red wine
[00:10:57.280] together. That's hella funny. And Crystal and I have made a lot of jokes together about how a steak dinner is a very classic boy meal. It's like the one meal that a guy knows how to cook. So this year,
[00:11:09.920] I was like, should we switch it up a little bit? So I think we're gonna go pick up some like sashimi from one of those Japanese markets and slice it ourselves and do like a nice Japanese style dinner
[00:11:21.600] at home. So nice. Not a steak dinner this year. That's that's so funny, because it's literally what I did. Oh, last year. We did we did a dinner date at home and it was literally steak and wine.
[00:11:34.960] I think it's so funny because it's it's like maybe the first thing that a lot of guys learn to make but then they learn to make it really well too. So it's like, oh, I mean, I guess I'll take it right?
[00:11:45.440] Like, I just think a lot. So we did do that last year. But this year, I think same thing we're going to the other side of the 5050. We're gonna do a dinner date outside. So we're going to go to like
[00:11:55.920] a really nice Peruvian restaurant that we like nearby. I feel like I almost always go out for Valentine's Day. Not that I'm opposed to having a dinner like a stay in dinner. But I feel like
[00:12:08.720] I personally am kind of lazy to cook. And then so I'm like, I don't want to put the onus on my partner. So let's just like go out and have a nice meal. And then that way everyone can relax,
[00:12:20.240] except spend a lot of money. I actually have a really distinct memory though about going out for a Valentine's Day dinner, where I was talking to a bunch of my coworkers. And I was like, Oh my god,
[00:12:30.800] like this year, I think James and I are going to drive up to the city and have like a really nice dinner at this one steakhouse, which is somewhat close to my work. And my co workers like, Oh, why
[00:12:39.760] would you go into San Francisco on Valentine's Day? Why would you do that to yourself? And I thought that was a really weird comment where I was like, How dare you like we're gonna enjoy our Valentine's
[00:12:50.720] Day. But then that day we did go up, we did have the Valentine's Day dinner in the city. And it was indeed a somewhat bad experience for us. Because I feel like with Valentine's Day being such a holiday
[00:13:04.560] of like, oh, everyone is like, let's go out for dinner. It was just so busy. There was like a ton of traffic, impossible to find parking. And then that day specifically, everyone around us was like
[00:13:15.280] really drunk at the steakhouse for some reason. So then after that, I was like, Okay, if we're gonna do nice dinners, let's do it maybe like a day before or a day after or let's go out somewhere
[00:13:25.520] down in like the suburbs or like the smaller cities and not the heart of San Francisco Union Square. Yeah, that's fair. I feel like it's really busy during Valentine's Day. And it's the perfect
[00:13:36.880] excuse for restaurants to like raise their price for that day. And also people oftentimes go and like they're fighting for the reservations. True. I think this year I actually was like, Oh my god,
[00:13:48.880] mark your calendar. Like this is the time when the res releases for this one restaurant that we should go to for Valentine's Day. And so it was like on the dot, we log on and we like get the
[00:13:58.160] reservation. I didn't know that about the city. That sounds not not very cool to have during Valentine's Day. Just drunk people being belligerent. It was kind of okay, though, because I think James
[00:14:11.360] and I are very much into like the gossip and the TV. So then the couple next to us were like watching. They were like heavily fighting because the guy was really drunk. And we were like, we had like a silent dinner. We're just eavesdropping.
[00:14:24.000] That's so funny. So I guess like, nowadays, Valentine's Day is spent celebrating with our SOs. But how about before you were in a committed relationship? Did Valentine's Day have any meaning to you at all? Whether it was like negative or positive? I would say it was
[00:14:45.600] for me was pretty normal leaning on negative because there was people will joke that it's like a singles awareness day or whatever, which is the other name of Valentine's Day. For me,
[00:14:55.520] it was a pretty normal day. I wouldn't do anything special. I would just go about my normal day, go to work, go to the gym, play games at home, pretty usual stuff. I do remember like,
[00:15:05.280] since like it is quote unquote, singles awareness days, I think of me and like other single guy friends or maybe get dinner just just to have something to do. While everyone's posting like, you know, how Instagram stories of their dinner dates and fancy restaurants.
[00:15:19.600] So yeah, let's do that too. I think for me, it was always like slightly positive. Because if I didn't have a boyfriend or a date, I would always celebrate it with my parents. Because you know,
[00:15:30.640] the parents are like the couple at home. So then I was like the third wheel, but a welcome third wheel. So we would just get chocolates or I would help my dad get chocolate for my mom,
[00:15:39.760] pick up flowers for her or something like that. So I feel like there was always some sort of direction that it was going to. Oh, wait, then your parents kind of celebrated Valentine's Day?
[00:15:48.720] Like sorta, I guess it was more of an excuse to just get like chocolate and flowers and be like, Happy Valentine's Day. And that was kind of like the extent of it all. But we would probably do
[00:15:57.120] a slightly nicer dinner at home or go out or something like that. Wait, did your parents celebrate Valentine's Day, Daniel? I think pretty similar experience. I remember there being flowers every year. We have roses
[00:16:09.520] in the backyard. So my dad always just like get some from the backyard and put it in a vase for my mom. And then we would have like a slightly nicer dinner, but usually at home. They wouldn't
[00:16:20.400] really celebrate on their own, like a slightly special occasion at home. They weren't very like, it wasn't like the classic American Valentine's. Wait, that's kind of genius. Plant roses in the backyard so you never have to like go out and buy roses. And those are expensive.
[00:16:37.440] Especially on Valentine's Day. So true. I'm trying to remember if my parents celebrate it. I don't think they do. But the thing is, their wedding anniversary is close to Valentine's Day. So I think what they usually do
[00:16:50.720] is they just celebrate one or the other and they just go and have dinner without me. Esther's birthday is actually like right before Valentine's Day. So sometimes we do like a joint thing. But this year, I think we're doing two different celebrations, birthday party for
[00:17:07.760] her birthday. And then for Valentine's Day, we're gonna do our own dinner thing. Oh, that's nice. Double the gifts for her. Yeah, I guess that's kind of like when your birthday is too close to Christmas. And then
[00:17:18.080] people try to like package the gifts together. And then people are like, damn, I only get one thing for both of these. I have a friend whose entire family, it's a family of four, and they're all December babies.
[00:17:32.160] So then I think sometimes they do like one big like December party for like all four birthdays plus Christmas plus New Year's. Sad. Or happy. I feel like that could be one huge celebration, which is pretty cool. That's true.
[00:17:48.240] Have you ever done a Galentine's or a Palentine's? Or even attended one? I've actually never. I've never done a Palentine's. I even thought it was supposed to be called like Guy-lentines or something. But actually this year, so this year Esther,
[00:18:05.040] I think is also doing her, I don't think she does Galentine's normally either, but she got invited to one this year. So I think she's going to do one and then all like
[00:18:14.000] the boyfriends are gonna have nothing to do. So we might all just go hang out somewhere. And then I think the plan is for us to all come back together after like our individual Palentine, Galentines and then have like a joint like hangout or party or something.
[00:18:29.200] Oh, that's kind of nice. Oh yeah, that's cute. That's like turning the Valentine's Day thing into more of a community aspect, I feel like. Especially since you all congregate back at the end and celebrate together. Yeah, it'd be fun.
[00:18:45.600] I always wondered like if someone hosts a Galentine's or Palentine's, like do they discriminate against people in relationships? Like is it single people only? I have no idea. I mean, it sounds like everyone's going to be
[00:19:01.440] in a relationship because like the girls and then the guys, like the other half, we're all going to do our own thing. But I don't know if there are people invited. I don't think we're purposely discriminating, but... Like the segregation is crazy. It might just happen that way.
[00:19:19.360] Dude, that's like a reverse Galentine, Palentine situation. It's like only if you're in a relationship, you're invited to this activity. Taking women and taking men only. Yeah, I've also actually never been to like a Galentine's, I think. But this year,
[00:19:37.600] I was invited to one. So I'm very, very excited to attend. Wow. This is the year. This is the year we're all going to experience it. I went to a Galentine's last year, but the host was actually in a relationship.
[00:19:53.760] But I think it was like her boyfriend was out of town. So she was like, I'm just going to host a Galentine's. And I'm actually not sure if everyone was single there, but the vibe I got was like most people were single.
[00:20:06.560] But I think that was like the only true Galentine's I've had. This year, I don't think I'm invited to one. But maybe you guys didn't get invited to Galentine's or Palentine's before because you're in a relationship. Maybe. Yeah, definitely could be.
[00:20:25.040] Although this year, we're starting to break the pattern. I'm trying to go to some Galentine's celebration. Infiltrate. Gotta see what we've been missing out on. Yeah, exactly. So I guess aside from going out to dinner and also aside from celebrating
[00:20:41.040] Valentine's with your friends, how do you guys handle gifts for Valentine's Day with your SOs? I'm a little bit curious because I feel like there's multiple times a year we usually buy gifts for our SOs. So one being Christmas, one being birthdays.
[00:20:56.080] And I feel like those have kind of bigger expectations. But Valentine's Day, I'm always confused on how big of a gift should I buy? Or is it like a chocolate and roses kind of gift? Or is it like a real gift?
[00:21:06.480] So I'm curious to know how you guys handle that. For me, we do real gifts, actually. Plus the flowers and maybe chocolates or something. But I think for us, we definitely do give out gifts. It's another opportunity to give us each other stuff, I guess.
[00:21:26.560] Maybe just buying things for each other or ourselves. You're like, hey, actually, I've been meaning to get this one thing. Yeah. So yeah, like I said, Esther's birthday is right before Valentine's Day. But I pretty much got her two gifts.
[00:21:44.240] When I was buying them, I kind of had to plan out, oh, did I want to buy one big gift? But I ended up doing two, I guess not smaller gifts, but two different things.
[00:21:53.360] But pretty much on the same or equal level as a birthday gift, I would say. It's funny because, oh my god, I bought a gift for her for Valentine's Day. And then she was also getting me something.
[00:22:04.400] And then since we live together, we get the packages in the mail. We went to pick up our packages the other day. And we looked and it's literally both boxes are from the same place. And we were like, wait, did you buy something from this place?
[00:22:18.720] It's like, yeah. I think we might have gotten very similar things for each other. It was from Medjury or that jewelry place. But there are two of those boxes and we just had a good laugh about that. That's so cute. You guys are on the same wavelength.
[00:22:35.680] Unintentional matching. I think for me, it kind of depends. But as I'm thinking back, I think Valentine's Day has been a little more small scale for gifts. But my presence is a gift, I guess.
[00:22:53.040] Okay, to be fair though, in the past, I've been in a long distance relationship. So I would literally fly over to wherever the other person is. So that's a pretty good gift, right? That's true. That's actually monetary value next to that as well.
[00:23:09.520] Probably more expensive than the two gifts I bought. But yeah, since I would usually fly over, we would plan an experience essentially. So I feel like that is also a good alternative to gifts. But that's true. If I were wanting something, it would be the perfect excuse.
[00:23:28.880] Oh, Valentine's Day is coming up. Maybe we should do gifts this year. Yeah, I think I'm kind of similar to you, Crystal. Well, not like the flight stuff. But I kind of consider Valentine's to be slightly smaller scale than a birthday, for example.
[00:23:42.400] But I have in the past kind of played myself a little bit. Where sometimes I'm like, is Valentine's Day like a real holiday? So I'll be like, let's not do gifts, right? And then I'll end up feeling bad. So I'll buy a small gift.
[00:23:56.560] And then James taking my word at face value, he won't get me anything. Because he's like, oh, she said no gifts. And then when we do the gift exchange, I'm like, wait, what the fuck? Where's my gift? So I try not to do that anymore.
[00:24:13.840] That's your own fault. Yeah. Definitely played myself a little bit. I can totally see James being like, bro, you said no gifts. I'm like the worst about it. I'm also always like, yeah, don't get me flowers. They like die and I'm like allergic.
[00:24:29.440] But when I have flowers, I'm like super happy about it. James is like, can you pick a lane and just tell me what to do? But actually Esther, I think in the beginning she said the same thing. She's like, flowers are dumb.
[00:24:39.680] I'd rather just get plants because she's really big into plants. So one year, I don't remember if I didn't get her flowers or not. But I think she got flowers from her co-worker. And she was like, wow, look at this. Like, I feel so happy getting these flowers.
[00:24:51.200] And I was like, hmm, all right. And then I got her flowers. Actually, I feel like that's such a classic conflict. I've definitely seen that happen before with someone's newer relationship where the girl was like, no gifts, no flowers, don't worry.
[00:25:10.400] And then the guy truly just takes that at face value. And then the girl's like, yo, what the fuck? I'm kind of upset. I feel like maybe it wouldn't be. But then you start seeing maybe on social media or something.
[00:25:23.120] You're like, hmm, what are all these flowers people are getting? Now I want some. Yeah, that's fair. And I also wonder, though, so girls always get to get flowers as the typical or standard kind of thing. But what is the equivalent of flowers for guys?
[00:25:39.840] Would you feel happy receiving flowers? I mean, yeah. Yes, I would. But I guess it'd be a similar thing where I probably wouldn't need them. But it would be nice to just have just because. Like, I personally wouldn't probably care if I got flowers or not.
[00:25:56.160] But if I did, it's like I'd be unhappy. Right? Right. Every time Valentine's Day comes around, I always wonder in my head, like, what is the equivalent for guys? So what I've done before is like instead of a heart-shaped box of chocolate,
[00:26:12.560] it was like a heart-shaped box of jerky. I was like totally not expecting you to say that. That was a creative and unique gift. I would appreciate that, too. But then I know a lot of guys are sometimes like, oh, I would love to get flowers, too.
[00:26:34.960] Flower away. I feel like the thing about flowers, though, especially when you live with an SO, is gifting it to your SO who lives with you is basically like gifting it to yourself as well. Because I feel like a lot of the presentness
[00:26:49.520] or like the value of flowers is just like the happiness you get when you look at them, but you live together. So it's like here's a gift for you, but also for myself. Do double happiness. Oh, true. You don't have to look at it.
[00:27:00.800] So this year, Valentine's Day is coming up, so I was talking to my SO about it and I was like, oh, we don't have to do gifts this year. And then he was like, oh, but like can I still get you flowers?
[00:27:12.720] And I was like, oh sure, if you want. So I feel like that clarification is maybe like helpful if girls were to be like, no gifts, but flowers, okay. I like that though. I feel like there's also a little bit of intentionality in that.
[00:27:28.480] Oh, I respect that you don't want to do gifts, but I would still like to get you something. Versus like, oh, let's not do gifts. And the guy's like, oh, thank God. There's still like a gesture behind it. Yeah.
[00:27:39.760] I think one of the things too that Valentine's Day makes me think about, this is kind of like the one day a year where officially everyone is supposed to celebrate love and whatnot. But I feel like the other 364 days a year,
[00:27:52.480] you're also obligated to like love and support your SO. Obligated? Contractually obligated. I know on Valentine's Day, we talked about how a lot of it is like gift giving and nice dinners. But aside from Valentine's Day,
[00:28:08.240] how do you guys think you try to make your SO feel special or vice versa in your relationship? Honestly, so it's not actually too different from how we normally show each other appreciation. So like Valentine's Day, we'll cook for each other. We'll have a nice dinner.
[00:28:23.200] But we do those things pretty regularly too. Maybe like we used to do literally once a week, but maybe once a month now. One thing that I really appreciate that Esther does for me is cooking just in general. If I'm having a really busy day,
[00:28:35.680] she'll cook a meal that I like to eat since I don't have time to worry about food. Or just if I'm out, she'll clean the apartment just so that everything is nice and things are set when I come back home.
[00:28:48.000] Those are things that we do for each other. I'll do that for her too to show appreciation. And Valentine's Day is kind of just... It's all very similar, I think. We just kind of spend time with each other. I think on my end,
[00:29:02.080] one thing me and my partner try to do is we try to be intentional about the time that we spend together. Making specific plans and actually doing activities. Because the way I kind of think about it is in the future,
[00:29:17.920] once we reach the point of moving in together, then we're kind of constantly together. So the time that we spend together is probably a little less intentional by nature because we're just constantly together. And I guess it's a little harder to carve out us time
[00:29:34.240] versus this is just how things are. So now it's being specific and clear about things that we're doing. I think that's a really good point because I think you're right once you do live together, it is kind of coexisting a lot of the times
[00:29:52.240] and then us time is very specific times. I think for me and James, especially when we're really busy, we have our podcast stuff and book club calls and all this other stuff going on. Then when we'll catch up is right before we sleep, we'll watch TikToks together,
[00:30:08.480] share a moment instead of the rest of the day when we're running around trying to catch up with our own lives. I think in a way, Valentine's Day is, as I mentioned, a fake holiday, but still a good holiday
[00:30:20.480] because you are kind of pointedly celebrating us time together and making it a big occasion. But I think a lot of the way that love comes through on daily lives is like what Daniel was saying, right? Like, oh, someone's really busy,
[00:30:34.640] so you clean for the person you love or you remind them gently to call their parents or all these little things that kind of help them live their life in a very regulated and positive manner and you're just supporting each other.
[00:30:49.200] I feel like it's two different types of love when I think about it. Yeah, I think Valentine's Day just gives you another opportunity to be intentional about that us time because I'm sure we all do it already on a regular basis, on the weekends.
[00:31:04.080] I'm sure you have dinner dates or whatever. It's not as special as Valentine's Day, but it is pretty much the same thing. So when Valentine's comes around, it's just another opportunity to do that with the added flowers and all the specialness around the holiday
[00:31:18.720] or whatever, the commercialized stuff. It is nice because it sets that specific us time apart from the normal us time. Yeah, I feel like it's a good reminder too because it's kind of like, hey, it's Valentine's Day. Don't forget to put aside some time
[00:31:36.640] and really do something nice for your relationship or whatever. Yeah, just appreciate each other. Damn, low-key I feel like me and James don't do a ton of dinner dates. Yeah, we don't either, but sometimes on the weekends, we'll go to H Mart or something
[00:31:51.840] and then the sashimi thing you said, we do that sometimes just on Sundays because we'll be at H Mart and we see sashimi and be like, oh, let's do sashimi lunch and then that's something you would do for Valentine's Day,
[00:32:03.280] but also we would do it on a random Sunday, I guess. Yeah, that makes sense. Since you both live with your... Do you think there was an adjustment period where in the beginning it was really easy to kind of lose track of things
[00:32:17.840] and maybe do less date nights or did you feel like it just was very natural? For me, it was pretty natural. I think even after we moved in together, we would do date night Thursdays. So we would just do either dinner out or eat at home.
[00:32:34.000] More recently, we've been more busy, so we haven't really done that as much this month, but we always talk about how we want to do more and then Valentine's Day kind of... Again, it just gives us that opportunity, right? If you're too busy normally,
[00:32:46.400] then Valentine's Day is a good chance to catch up and have that day to appreciate each other when things are busy. I think for me, when we first moved in together, it felt a lot easier to set up time to hang out
[00:33:00.640] because you're literally under the same roof, right? So it's like, oh, we can do date nights and every meal is kind of like it's us time and things like that. But then I feel like at a certain point, life caught up to us a little bit.
[00:33:11.200] So days where we work late through the night or have other calls and meetings and whatever, I felt like it was actually a little bit harder because it's kind of like you have your date night time. So if you don't live together, you enjoy the time together
[00:33:26.000] and then you go home and then you tackle the other things in life that you need to tackle. But for us, we're under the same roof, right? So I sometimes felt like while we were eating dinner or something, I would be thinking about all the things
[00:33:36.720] that I would have to do. So then I feel like there's less of a separation there of like, oh, I'm gonna immerse myself in this. It's harder to snap out of it and snap into it because it's kind of the same space
[00:33:46.560] where you would do all your chores and you look around and you're like, oh, I have to clean the house and whatnot. So I think it's kind of like a balancing act. And I think now that a lot of our like, wedding obligations are done,
[00:33:57.520] it definitely does feel a little bit easier. But I think we kind of had to go through that a little bit to kind of find what works for us. Esther and I are both, we love to stay home and like just play games.
[00:34:09.520] So a lot of times nowadays when it's like Thursday night where we normally go out on a date, we'd be like, we just look at each other and be like, can we just stay home and play games today?
[00:34:17.600] And then we both agree, we're like, yeah, that sounds nice. And then we end up just doing that at like our desk. I mean, I feel like that can easily be categorized as a date night still because you're like, I'm assuming playing games together. Yeah, yeah, true.
[00:34:31.600] I mean, I guess it's gaming date night every night. Yeah, yeah. And you know, some games out there really put your teamwork to the test. So... Oh yeah, been there with the Valorant fights. You guys should play It Takes Two. Is that a co-op game? Yeah, it is.
[00:34:53.200] We've been trying to find more co-op games because we're both really into like super competitive, like grindy, sweaty multiplayer games like Valorant, like TFT where we're both, we both get really tilted sometimes. So we're like, maybe we should find a co-op game where we can actually relax.
[00:35:10.560] Dude, you should do like It Takes Two. Another fun one is called We Were Here and it's like a four game series. And it's all about like communication and teamwork. Well, I think I played It Takes Two with James but at one point James was clutching both controllers.
[00:35:30.960] He was like playing for both. I was like, sorry. I don't know how to do this. It takes one, he said. Actually, I guess another big one is like Overcooked, right? Oh, true. But when it first came out, I was just like,
[00:35:47.120] dude, I don't have time to like play with other people. So I just soloed the whole thing. Oh my God. So, you know. I don't think we're playing these co-op games, right? I guess back onto the Valentine's Day topic a little bit.
[00:36:07.740] Do you feel like there's anything you do in addition to what you regularly do that makes Valentine's Day feel more special? Because I guess we talked a little bit about having the day there officially is in itself a little bit nice and different.
[00:36:25.420] But do you make your gestures more grand? Or is there anything else that you do on top of that? Or is it just kind of like another set date night? I think this is kind of a funny question
[00:36:38.060] because the other day I was hanging out with my good friend and she was like, oh, are you going to do a Valentine's Day card for James? I was kind of thinking about it and I was like,
[00:36:48.220] it's been a while since I really sat and wrote a card. I think I used to a lot more in college. But after we moved in together, I don't recall the time that I did for Valentine's Day. My friend actually lives with her as well.
[00:37:01.260] So I was like, oh no, I don't think we're going to do one. Like, do you do one? And she said that every year she always writes her a Valentine's Day card even though they live together, even though he already knows that she loves him
[00:37:12.940] because she's like, why would you? Sometimes when you put pen to paper, thoughts and feelings come up more or better than the way that they would come out of your mouth basically. And I thought that was really striking because she's totally right.
[00:37:27.820] I think when I sit down to write a card, things come to mind that I normally wouldn't necessarily say out loud. So that's kind of one of the things that I'm going to try to do this year, write him a little Valentine's Day card.
[00:37:39.260] Are you going to get a cars themed one? With a nerds candy in it. That's cute. That is true. I think putting things on paper is definitely different. For me, yeah. I think the thing that sets it apart from the dinner date we kind of already touched upon,
[00:37:53.580] but it's like the classic Valentine's things. Like I got her a bouquet of flowers that'll come in like on Valentine's Day and I'll try to set it up. I guess a lot of it is, yeah, like the traditions, like getting flowers and really having the intention
[00:38:08.620] that you set aside time for this day. I guess, especially because Valentine's Day is not always on the weekend. So it's like, oh yeah, like even if it's a busy weekday, we'll try to set aside time just because it's Valentine's Day. So that in itself
[00:38:21.820] and the intention of it all is kind of special too. Yeah, I'm thinking for me and I think I'm similar to Daniel where it's kind of just like, yeah, you know, we go through the traditions and then nothing else is like necessarily important.
[00:38:35.980] Nothing else is like necessarily super extra. Yeah, I guess the gift giving is also different. You don't give gifts normally on a regular dinner date. But I guess that's almost like better that Valentine's Day isn't so different from your other days because if it were so different,
[00:38:55.900] it's like, well, why? Right? Like why can't you do this? Do not love each other normally. Actually kind of touching on that, I think Daniel spoke a little bit about it earlier, but I always find scrolling through social media on Valentine's Day very interesting
[00:39:11.740] because I think each couple has a very different approach to social media, to gifts, to Valentine's Day in general. So I was like, oh, this person celebrates it like this. And sometimes I'm like, whoa, they like really went all out for Valentine's Day.
[00:39:25.500] Oh my God, the funniest thing was maybe two years ago during Valentine's Day, I was looking through my Instagram stories and literally I saw maybe like 10 or 15 stories in a row of couples going on a sushi date for Valentine's. Like classic.
[00:39:42.300] Dude, I'm wondering now if IG stories on Valentine's Day are the new Valentine's Day cards we used to pass around in elementary school. Oh my God. Well, this was really fun to kind of take a trip down memory lane all the way from elementary school
[00:39:58.780] to now as working adults and see how we have celebrated Valentine's Day in different ways over the years. So thank you, Daniel, for joining us and sharing all your Valentine's Day stories with us. For our listeners out there, hopefully this gave you a couple of ideas
